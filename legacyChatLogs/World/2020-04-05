 Dan4: Is there a way to increase font size for the editor, other than zooming the page?
 chucknorris: you can use external editor with browser plugin
 Dan4: Oh, cool. Checking out CG Local for Firefox now. Thanks!
 StepanSmirnov: @The_Duck also you can charge 1 remaining point and use action in the same turn. a.e. torpedo_cooldown was 2, then you do MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO 5 8

 DJCaptainSaxophone_615: why my "bombDir" is empty?
 DJCaptainSaxophone_615: when I'm doing like "cerr&gt;&gt;bombDir&lt;&lt;endl;
 Zenoscave: cerr &lt;&lt; bomDir &lt;&lt; endl; you mean?
 DJCaptainSaxophone_615: in my code it is bombDir
 Zenoscave: the &lt;&lt; is the important part
 DJCaptainSaxophone_615: I got tha, I have &lt;&lt;,
 estipx: fsdf
 kovi: .88 is the new top
 Zenoscave: .88 what?
 Zenoscave: Ah I see
 eulerscheZahl: spamming SILENCE makes me play stronger vs myself offline but is worse in the arena&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i should improve my silence tracking
 dbdr: hey
 dbdr: what's .88?
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Zenoscave: it's gone
 dbdr: OK&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: last digits in score?
 Zenoscave: top scores were 32.88, 31.88 and 31.88 for a bit
 dbdr: didn't Illedan mention allowing several MSG per turn?
 kovi: oh, new avatarKaulquappe?
 dbdr: does not seeme to work for me
 eulerscheZahl: kaulquappe? that's a hypnoshark!
 dbdr: that would be quite useful for debugging
 eulerscheZahl: there is no multi-message support
 Zenoscave: relation to the toad?
 dbdr: OK
 eulerscheZahl: do you want the pirate toad back?
 Zenoscave: your choice tbh
 eulerscheZahl: the shark is under water
 kovi: just like tadpole
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/4AD36336/hypnotoad-is-a-pirate/">https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/4AD36336/hypnotoad-is-a-pirate/</a>that's the other water-themed profile pic i used in the past
 dbdr: aren't all toads water-related?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: fix your bot
 dbdr: me?
 eulerscheZahl: yeahdistracting from your previous question
 dbdr: I thought you would want the opposite
 eulerscheZahl: distract you from working on your bot?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i do both right now
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:)
 dbdr: gg
 AntiSquid: hi ...................0............
 chucknorris: is there any silence spammer bot in gold&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: very few if any
 Zenoscave: I only silence when I get too few possible paths
 chucknorris: hm I can add silver boots to ide cool
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave one of us is tracking wrong <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445659504">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445659504</a>
 eulerscheZahl: silver boots? :boot:
 friska: chucknorris me
 Zenoscave: who do you think it is?
 eulerscheZahl: don't know Zenoscavejust noticed the difference
 Zenoscave: which frame?
 Zenoscave: I have a lag bug so my MSG might be one frame off of yours
 eulerscheZahl: around 145
 eulerscheZahl: of course the frames are a little different
 eulerscheZahl: but we get the same numbers before
 Zenoscave: fair
 eulerscheZahl: and then completely different
 Zenoscave: It has to do with trigger i think
 friska: Guys, what do you think about sonar?
 friska: Should I use it?
 eulerscheZahl: but i can assure you that i still have your real location as one of my possible candidates for you
 Zenoscave: same here...
 eulerscheZahl: SONAR helps in the early game sometimesdon't don't use it too much
 eulerscheZahl: but you have more possible locations for yourself you have 13, while i narrowed it down to 6 without removing the good one
 Zenoscave: Yeah I must have a bug
 Zenoscave: some of my locations aren't possible
 friska: thanks
 wlesavo: wow euler, new avatar and insta top5, i guess 5% rule does work
 Zenoscave: 5% rule?
 eulerscheZahl: that's my tracking of you Zenoscave <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/QwGNfdT">https://imgur.com/a/QwGNfdT</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and i rolled back to my bot from yesterday&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: do you consider silence?
 eulerscheZahl: that question :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: hell yes!
 Zenoscave: I was watching your movements not mine lol
 Zenoscave: ooops
 eulerscheZahl: we have the message parts swapped
 Zenoscave: right
 mark7: what is good way of minimizing surface
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to use it at all. I guess that would be perfect minimizing
 mark7: Haha:joy:
 wlesavo: Zenoscave you have +5% winrate having an avatar, euler have it even for changing one
 eulerscheZahl: i would love to see some real improvement on my bot
 eulerscheZahl: not happening so far&#160;:/
 YannT: yo who made me fall during the night :angry:
 eulerscheZahl: gravity
 eulerscheZahl: but Newton claimed the discovery for himself already, you are late
 kovi: :smile:
 tranculent: if you "submit" your current contest code, you can still modify/edit it before the deadline right?
 aseweryn: I often loose in 1st round and I don't know why? Could it be time?
 eulerscheZahl: yes tranculentyou can submit (almost) as often as you want
 eulerscheZahl: yes aseweryn that's possible
 eulerscheZahl: what language are you using? some like Java are slow at startup
 aseweryn: kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: JVM, should be the same problem
 aseweryn: ok, thx
 eulerscheZahl: try to play a turn without actually using the result
 eulerscheZahl: for warmup
 wlesavo: tranculent more than that you have to submit to get to the next league 
 eulerscheZahl: or: do you do and preprocessing on the map? distance calculations or alike?
 aseweryn: yes
 tranculent: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: make sure to do as much as you can before printing your starting position, that way it's counted to the 1s turn
 aseweryn: so maybe I should do it in second round?
 eulerscheZahl: 1st turn (choose your initial position) is 1s timelimit
 aseweryn: ok, thx. I'll try
 eulerscheZahl: next is 50ms
 eulerscheZahl: so move as much as possible to the 1s
 wlesavo: do you calculate much in this 1s? i barely use, although probably should
 eulerscheZahl: dist for each cell to each other (BFS)
 eulerscheZahl: for torpedo range
 AntiSquid: it's like some of the bugs themselves have silence
 CoHangXom: Hello
 AntiSquid: hi
 AntiSquid: well rekt dbdr
 dbdr: i'm borken, yes :D
 wlesavo: AntiSquid just make them to surface
 AntiSquid: i think i found that particular bug and it looks really stupid @_@
 AntiSquid: like how did i even consider writing that nonsense, kind of bug
 wlesavo: i felt this way revisiting the wood parts of the bot, although i still have some wood parts
 wlesavo: Zenoscave did you made mine escaping?
 Zenoscave: yup
 wlesavo: nice
 Zenoscave: really horrible and basic version
 Zenoscave: mostly fixed tracking bugs
 Zenoscave: top 10!!!!
 wlesavo: this was why i asked :slight_smile:
 Zenoscave: Yeah&#160;:)
 wlesavo: i guess basic mine escaping better than none
 Zenoscave: Also tracking bug was really bad. euler saw it
 wlesavo: i wonder why im still around top5, didnt improve much since the end of the silver, basically only changed mine planting a bit
 Zenoscave: chucknorris you wreck me
 Compiler_Master: Hello World!
 kovi: i didnt improve much either
 Zenoscave: kovi small tweaks then?
 kovi: bit more than tweaks, but no breakthrough
 kovi: and mostly bugfixes....and introduction of new bugs&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Always the game
 YannT: same here, I have my next big idea but I'm wondering if it wouldn't be worth it to tune things before trying it
 chucknorris: do use use brutaltester to finetune magic numbers&#160;? 
 chucknorris: you*
 YannT: no I don't, maybe should
 chucknorris: yeah atm I use submit to do that, but I find it a bit... inefficient 
 YannT: is the ooc referee available somewhere?
 dbdr: YannT it's linked in the statement
 YannT: oh, right

 AntiSquid: does CG enhancer show timeouts or games where the bot breaks&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: no. it can't without creating lots of traffic
 YannT: I'm not managing to make brutaltester work with  this referee
 YannT: the command sent by brutaltester to launch a game with the referee seems wrong
 SuperYoyo92: heurhezui

 AntiSquid: different username though
 eulerscheZahl: oh, was talking about total bot war
 AntiSquid: espiblop and says he is french
 eulerscheZahl: and guinote
 AntiSquid: and apparently it's a contest 
 AntiSquid: The age limit for participating in the EurobotOpenfinals is 30 years.
 AntiSquid: that's a weird cut off
 AntiSquid: could always ask one of my friends to submit my bot ... 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm below that limit, i can participate \o/
 AntiSquid: ya didn't read it all:However, each team may have a supervisorwhose age limit exceeds 30.
 eulerscheZahl: so your team = 1 supervisor, 0 players?
 AntiSquid: no, you need a participant below 30 that can explain the bot and such

 AntiSquid: ok well found a bug&#160;!
 Alisher_Kamolov: hello
 AntiSquid: hi
 YannT: eulerscheZahl: I  added a runner class to the referee so it works with brutaltester
 YannT: do you guys want a PR on that?
 eulerscheZahl: no, the brutaltester is not part of the game engine but a 3rd party tool
 YannT: fair enough
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave also made a brutaltester version
 wlesavo: AntiSquid fix it
 eulerscheZahl: you can even find it as a closed PR on the official github
 YannT: well too late I did the thing too :p
 YannT: it's just one class to add but I had to screw around with it to  get it to work
 ZarthaxX: lol toad that pic
 AntiSquid: ya i am wlesavo
 AntiSquid: on it
 emh: are there any competitive applications of permutations on CodinGame? enumeration, generating random ones, compact bit representations or 2d permutations like Latin squares? I guess puzzles too, but more prefer optimization where can compete and get a rank
 emh: hmm well I'll play Bulls and Cows now
 wlesavo: just was gonna tell :slight_smile:
 emh: oh hehe ok&#160;:)
 wlesavo: wow, occassionaly some predictions worked better than expected, so now i know what im gonna do next
 chucknorris: emh in your BFS algorithm the distance of a point is equal to the iteration when it was reached?
 emh: chucknorris yes should be. double check that it is not +-1. as I didn't use it yet
 emh: for something "useful" hehe
 chucknorris: I use it in my bot. but sometimes itdoes strange steps. I blame it on your BFS algorithm :D 
 emh: oh hehe bug reports welcome
 chucknorris: it does pretty good job tho. with its performance I could switch to 2ply
 emh: chucknorris did you account for that there is no expansion done in first iteration if you start from a black cell?
 emh: found some bugs in the article text regarding black/white/odd/even btw. republished
 aangairbender: how many ppl are there in gold league&gt;
 chucknorris: I always clear the starting point 
 emh: aangairbender 148
 aangairbender: ty
 aangairbender: I am 2nd in silver and... it's strange feeling
 aangairbender: beat everyone except boss
 emh: chucknorris what do you mean you "clear" the starting point? the BFS takes as input the map where only starting point is set
 chucknorris: and the map where the occupied cells are set. I clear the starting point on that 
 chucknorris: no I actually do the inverse. set the starting point on the map of available cells 
 emh: chucknorris ok. but did you understand that the BFS alternates between expanding from black to white and white to black? if nothing happens on first iteration i++ will increase i even if no expansion was done. leading to an off by one bug
 emh: I guess I should fix the code in article to be more robust, at expense of some performance perhaps
 chucknorris: I don't use the code in the article. I ported the python version to c++
 chucknorris: but I see hte black white thing you are talking about
 chucknorris: gonna check, thanks
 emh: ok. btw the code in the article is pretty optimized (can get up to 2 mill per 50ms). how's your performance with the python port?
 chucknorris: 1094071
 chucknorris: on empty map
 emh: ah ok decent
 chucknorris: I use it currenty only to count reachable cells. and I use __builtin_popcountll
 emh: ah ok
 emh: I'm modifying the code in article a bit. moving i++ after if and break. because my objective was to count work done not distance but I guess most people are interested in distance in number of iterations
 JFB: About what article you tahlkoh, emh?
 emh: JFB <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search</a>
 ZarthaxX: tahlkoh?
 Illedan: H9
 AntiSquid: miss, no ship on H9B3
 Illedan: :D
 ZarthaxX: lol
 JFB: ZarthaxX - simply topo (talking -&gt; tahlkoh). It was shown that 1 letter has only 1 bit of information - so people can guess next letter with 50% of probability. So emh understood and answered my question despite such terrible typos
 kovi: sigh, my silver code does even better than my latest
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: i knew you said talking
 ZarthaxX: but thought it was another lang lol
 JFB: ZarthaxX - my lang&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: real or fake lang&#160;? :P
 Counterbalance: aren't they all made up?
 JFB: fake of course&#160;:-) 
 AntiSquid: new keyboard JFB&#160;?
 dbdr: kovi, really?
 kovi: yes
 dbdr: :O
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance good point
 JFB: AntiSquid - wireless keyboard on my legs - and legs on the desk&#160;:-)
 JFB: I am a far-sighted person and this is my normal position at home office&#160;:-)
 Nagatwin: Thanks for the advice yesterday Counterbalance my perf greatly improved wth arrays of structs
 Counterbalance: cool&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: what advice? Counterbalance :I
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: the good old arrays
 ZarthaxX: got that one
 JFB: emh - interesting code. I have to port my Python code to C++ and see do simply use 256 bits is much slower that your 2 * 2 * 64 bits (black and white) 
 emh: JFB thanks&#160;:). pb4 put me on the right track regarding that as even his 4x64 code was faster than my 256 bit AVX2 code when we were without black and white tricks
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: emh you are crazy
 ZarthaxX: obsessed :P
 struct: Where is the frog
 ZarthaxX: the frog is no more
 pb4: big different between silver code and gold code kovi&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a hypnoshark, as sharks are under water
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i'm getting more and more frustrated about my inability to improve
 kovi: yes, dozen+ differences
 mark7: How you guys, find longest path between two cells, in grid, so that we can use less SURFACE as possible
 Nagatwin: euler what was your replay input maker&#160;?

 eulerscheZahl: that's what i initially had in mind
 mark7: why not don't utilize sonar much?
 eulerscheZahl: then CG added our error stream to the replays, so i stopped working on it
 eulerscheZahl: SONAR costs 4 charges that i can't invest in mines or silence
 mark7: But, doesn't it helps tacking opponent?
 mark7: it removes 25/400 cells
 eulerscheZahl: it does help
 eulerscheZahl: but first of all there are 15x15 = 225 cells in total
 eulerscheZahl: second not all are possible if you properly track the opponent movement
 mark7: sorry 200* cells
 eulerscheZahl: with proper tracking you can usually limit the possible opponent locations quite good without sonar
 Zhmyh: sonar is useful when it can remove ~50-75% of cells
 mark7: Only use sonar when opponent appears in more than one sector
 eulerscheZahl: without getting a lucky guess you can only remove 50% of the candidates best-case
 mark7: Currently I am using sonar on sector which has most possible opponents.
 Zhmyh: that's the most efficient
 mark7: Also, how you guys find path that minimizes use of SURFACE, because 3 SURFACE COST A LOT 
 eulerscheZahl: same, that's the only way it makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: best expected number of reduced candidates
 eulerscheZahl: there are ways to minimize surfacing, e.g. generating a path and sequentially extending it by adding extra dents
 eulerscheZahl: but usually just taking a long path isn't what you want
 Zhmyh: finding path which minimizes SURFACE is probably NP hard problem
 eulerscheZahl: instead you want to hide your location to the opponent and ship around mines
 mark7: right now I select a bottom left cell and then find path to top right cell, then When I reach top right cell I goto bottom right cell ...
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, the Hamilton path is NP complete. but there are still some good heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/7l64NqQ">https://imgur.com/a/7l64NqQ</a>that's from the tron multiplayer game
 eulerscheZahl: first i extend by going in 1 direction
 eulerscheZahl: then i add an extra path to that as soon as i can by going away in a 90° angle and instantly returning (green)
 eulerscheZahl: do the same again in dark blue, then pink and finally light blue
 eulerscheZahl: you can also check for articulation points and solve each component indivitually
 eulerscheZahl: but as i said: this kind of movement won't help you in the contest, as there are more things to consider (hiding, avoiding mines)
 mark7: Ohh!, go straight then 90* then straight, avoid mines :v:
 eulerscheZahl: actually my current bot doesn't even try to optimize path length
 mark7: Also, I am confused should I shoot first or move first, in some situation shooting first makes sense in some situation moving first
 eulerscheZahl: i check both possibilities
 eulerscheZahl: shooting first has the advantage that you can directly recharge your torpedo
 eulerscheZahl: in the same turn
 mark7: Okay, That I didn't taught of!! 
 mark7: Is My tracking good enough ==&gt;1. plot all empty space in map as possible opponent.2. As they move change the map accordingly3. if they shoot, they are in range of 5 
 mark7: 4. If i shoot and miss or hit, they are near 
 mark7: 4. they use silence add 4  posiblities all directions
 icecream17: if they move down, they cant silence up
 mark7: Yes that is correct
 mark7: I also taught of implementing a map of all their visited places so I can predict where they will move
 mark7: but thats kindda hard
 eulerscheZahl: i store a list of taken paths rather than a list of current cells
 eulerscheZahl: it's not allowed to visit the same cell twice, so that excludes some silence targets
 eulerscheZahl: and also helps reducing when the opponent keeps moving after SILENCE
 mark7: Okay so you start with 225 lists.
 eulerscheZahl: and these grow in length for every cell visited
 eulerscheZahl: and if a cell appears twice in a list, you can remove that path
 RyanMcCall: Hey, Mark7, english probably isn't your first language so just so you know when you are using taught I think you are meaning thought.
 AntiSquid: fixed few bugs earlier today &gt; rank 105, fixed all bugs i could find &gt; back to rank ~150so what's the next logical step? add some bugs back into the bot?
 mark7: yes :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: English isn't the first language for most of us here
 RyanMcCall: That's great! Hats off for learning a second language and using it so well
 eulerscheZahl: i suffered a lot in school :D
 AntiSquid: implying that native english speakers don't make horrendous mistakes
 icecream17: i'm amazed how many people learn english. i cant learn a second language....
 eulerscheZahl: my interest only grew when i wanted to access some English-only contest (like coding websites or TV shows)
 icecream17: how is english different from... (i really should be taking notes)
 mark7: A Doubt doesn't using silence for more than one step makes your path short resulting in earlier SURFACE
 RyanMcCall: Totally understand that. I attempted learning Japanese at one point because the voice actors for anime are better in Japan.
 AntiSquid: kinda does mark7
 Michiel: Uh, is this a bug in the Ocean of Code game?
 Michiel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445818900">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445818900</a>
 Counterbalance: In europe it's pretty common to know at least 2 and often 3 or 4 languages.
 eulerscheZahl: SURFACE isn't as bad as getting hit by a torpedo
 Zhmyh: usually you die even before 2nd SURFACE
 eulerscheZahl: no bug Michiel, you just decided to spawn on an island
 eulerscheZahl: pick another starting location
 eulerscheZahl: so i'm lame with only 2 languages (German + English)&#160;:(does Latin count?
 Michiel: Oops, I didn't realize we could choose a starting location
 Michiel: Sorry!
 AntiSquid: latin learned in school doesn't count eulerscheZahl
 icecream17: that reminds me of when i said "i just noticed the Exploroses"
 AntiSquid: in vatican they use a different latin from the one they teach in schools :D
 AntiSquid: so  there's no point to learning latin
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty much fluent in C#. does that count?
 mark7: I have Rank 1 in Bronze league why am I not getting promoted?
 eulerscheZahl: is your submit at 100%?
 mark7: no 66&#160;%
 eulerscheZahl: then you have to wait till it finishes
 mark7: Okay
 mark7: Hope rank dont go down, looking at my messy code :joy:
 darkhorse64: If you are above the Boss at 66%, your prospects look good
 eulerscheZahl: 0.12 above the boss at the moment
 mark7: Lets see
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445821715">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445821715</a>you can see the score below the replay. these update faster than the leaderboard
 mark7: 80&#160;%
 AntiSquid: make sure you also write current rank while updating the chat with submit progress
 mark7:&#160;!
 mark7: 1
 AntiSquid: and do it every minute or it won't be as efficient
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 darkhorse64: mark7 == cegprakask&#160;?
 mark7:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, ceg knows the promotion conditions
 darkhorse64: *cegprakash*
 AntiSquid: the transformation is incomplete, but he is getting there
 mark7: Yay! Silver League
 mark7: :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: ceg once cloned a param tuner from my github
 eulerscheZahl: he let it run for 3 days straight
 Quidome: It looks like you can't place and detonate the same mine in the same turn
 eulerscheZahl: then read the manual and realized that he had to adjust his bot to actually parse param values from a given textfile
 darkhorse64: Congrats. Next step gold
 mark7: Will reach gold in few days.
 darkhorse64: Copy/paste is a bad thing
 eulerscheZahl: Quidome as stated: "You can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn."
 icecream17: you got to silver!
 Quidome: Ah, yes, was only checking the mine part, it is in the trigger part:)
 Quidome: thank you
 Quidome: It was messing up my opponent finding :D
 mark7: @icecream17 yay!
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i always place my mines at the end of the turn. so i don't have to make sure not to trigger a newly placed mine
 Quidome: Ah! Great Idea
 eulerscheZahl: lazy idea
 mark7: :joy:
 Quidome: I was wandering how to fix this, but this will do the trick
 Quidome: Easy :D
 eulerscheZahl: will modify your bot behavior a bit, as you have different cells in placement range
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445823867">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445823867</a>see move 166 - to end, how did opponent predict my position? Or, just luck
 Quidome: Fixed it, and yes you are right
 Quidome: Behaviour change will be no problem for me
 mark7: My bot did suicide :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Quidome: Suicide is a problem ...
 mark7: fixed! 
 mark7: Should I also implement a map that replicates how my opponent can predict me? If is time to SILENCE etc.. 
 eulerscheZahl: top players do that
 eulerscheZahl: also to decide where to move to
 icecream17: so if the opponent has 6 lives i can assume the opponents doing the move that gives the least information....
 mark7: Ohh!, moving in direction which doesnt minimize possiblitites
 pb4: "eulerscheZahl 18H38lazy idea"   --&gt; lazy here too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think the moment of the mine placement makes a big difference
 eulerscheZahl: for torpedoes it's more relevant
 reCurse: So mine placement is not relevant?
 eulerscheZahl: it doesn't matter if you do it at the beginning or the end of your turn
 eulerscheZahl: even if that changes cells in range
 reCurse: Hence my question
 eulerscheZahl: at least that's my opinion, i might be wrong
 eulerscheZahl: but not doing mines at all is a bad idea
 reCurse: I meant placement as in positioning sorry
 wlesavo: didnt change much for me
 eulerscheZahl: i don't just take a random position. the direction has some kind of preference
 wlesavo: random vs some kind of trying to achieve more uniform distribution didnt have much effect
 pb4: reCurse&#160;: doesn't matter enough to warrant the complexity of considering placement before and after movement
 pb4: + before &amp; after silence
 eulerscheZahl: he asks surprisingly many questions about the game for an observer
 pb4: haha
 pb4: I guess we'll know in 14 days
 eulerscheZahl: one of the rare times i will see the recalc + chat activity live
 eulerscheZahl: home office has advantages :D
 reCurse: I'm just curious...
 reCurse: I did toy around with it for a few days but nothing great
 reCurse: Still interested in the meta
 eulerscheZahl: claim a large region and place mines, then avoid the opponent area
 eulerscheZahl: and some fighting when one player gets too close to the other
 reCurse: Then it seems like mine positioning would be important
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm just looking for excuses not to code it
 reCurse: :D
 reCurse: All hardcoded or search-based?
 eulerscheZahl: search-guided heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: i simulate a few things like how a move will affect the opponent tracking
 reCurse: No idea how to search for an opponent with unknown information
 eulerscheZahl: and then use heuristics to decide and pre-filter moves
 eulerscheZahl: and bruteforce for instant kills
 chucknorris: the ide environment is different from the arena environment? I sometimes timeout but only in the ide
 eulerscheZahl: rust has release mode in the arenaC++ has a debugger attached in the IDE afaik
 chucknorris: ah cool I can increase my time limit then I guess
 eulerscheZahl: those testing against you in the IDE will hate that
 chucknorris: IDE testers HATE him
 mark7: @euler what data structure you used to track opponent, currently using HashMap&lt;Point, LinkedList&lt;Point&gt;&gt; 
 icecream17: if (possibleOpp &gt; 40) {dont}
 icecream17: possibleOpp.length... 40
 eulerscheZahl: if have a List&lt;Path&gt; with Path = List&lt;Cell&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: but i might change my path to bool[,] or HashSet&lt;Cell&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: what is that Point keyvalue? current cell?
 mark7: x, y
 eulerscheZahl: you can have different ways to reach the current cell
 mark7: yeas
 eulerscheZahl: if you only store one of them, you might exclude it later, while it's still possible to get there on another path
 mark7: when I start should I create  a list for all empty cell..
 mark7: Okay.
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i do
 mark7: dont need hashmap
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 mark7: first element in list is its starting point
 mark7: Okay :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: yeah and last is current position
 eulerscheZahl: but the list is slow to check for same cell twice as it gets longer
 mark7: Set?
 eulerscheZahl: hashset and boolean array have a constant lookup time
 mark7: How do you decide starting point?
 eulerscheZahl: somewhere in the center of the largest component
 mark7: center or on with most open space?
 mark7: component?
 eulerscheZahl: that's the point where you should start experimenting on your own
 eulerscheZahl: component: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441502486">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441502486</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the bottom left part can't be reached from the center
 mark7: Okay! thanks for help. 
 mark7: Is there a way if i want to play my bot against yours? or a specific player?
 eulerscheZahl: delete the default AI
 eulerscheZahl: then add a new player
 eulerscheZahl: you can only fight your own league and below
 eulerscheZahl: so i can fight you but you can't fight me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445846888">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445846888</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my debug output (below my avatar) shows your possible paths and current cells, then the same for you tracking me
 mark7: 344 moves are respectable :joy: against top 10
 eulerscheZahl: at 1000 paths i prune
 eulerscheZahl: but still 4 lives remaining for me&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: euler how do you chose which to prune?
 pb4: states.shuffle();states.resize(1000)
 pb4:&#160;;
 Zenoscave: smart. didn't think of shuffle
 chucknorris: in gold I dont think you have to prune anymore. there are no longer 50k+ states
 kovi: at least not in top
 Zenoscave: I can only handly 1k...
 Zenoscave: handle*
 chucknorris: I removed the pruning code(which made me timeout ironically). I no longer timeout :p
 Counterbalance: some gold bots crashed my bot with &gt; 400k states
 chucknorris: do you remember which one was that&#160;? 
 Counterbalance: hm no, it was a couple of hours ago. One of the new arrivals from silver.
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave i create new states from current positions and throw away all my history&#160;:(
 Counterbalance: perhaps it was hkit, chucknorris - seeing 20k states there
 chucknorris: yeah thx. in the ide he makes me timeout sometimes
 Zenoscave: I timeout against jft6 3
 Quidome: what counts as a state in this discussion? A complete move or a 'sub' move?
 Counterbalance: a path
 eulerscheZahl: visited cells + mine drops
 Quidome: Uh, ok 
 Quidome: for lookahead or only the possibities left when you have processed all the opponent orders?
 Zenoscave: the last one
 Quidome: I have a much lower number on that
 Quidome: wandering now if I do something wrong :P
 Counterbalance: it usually is very low, except when there's a lot of silence
 eulerscheZahl: i would love to have a lower number too. like only the real location
 Zenoscave: kovi you're half my losses rn
 wlesavo: that would be helpful
 mark7: I sometimes have no state
 Zenoscave: hurry your submit up :P
 mark7: :joy:
 mark7: My bot completely misses opponent not a single possibility 
 eulerscheZahl: debug time
 mark7: I neeeed coffee :joy:
 wlesavo: had to go back to yeasterday version of code, because with this latest "improvements" barely could get even to top10
 chucknorris: top10 is pretty dense rn
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, got kicked out&#160;:/
 wlesavo: well backup pretty reliably gets to #2, with the same tune parameters, smths was obviously broken
 Illedan: Nice siman
 kovi: wow
 dbdr: he's two standard deviations above everyone else
 wlesavo: i think its due to that shoot-&gt;silence combo
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't think that such a lead would still be possible, as everyone else has pretty much the same score
 wlesavo: looks really effective
 dbdr: don't other people do it?
 eulerscheZahl: valgrowth killed me a few times with it even before he reached top10
 Zenoscave: I try
 Zenoscave: do you move towards an opponent if you know his location?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm shy
 wlesavo: i dunno, it looks like his shooting treshold is really low
 eulerscheZahl: you can only do that when you use a lot of silence to still hide your location i guess
 pb4: wtf
 pb4: stop running over me y'all
 pb4: I was first 15minutes ago
 Zenoscave: lol
 pb4: 6th now without repushing -_-
 eulerscheZahl: i wish i could just on the train too
 dbdr: sic transit gloria mundi
 Zenoscave: glory fades?
 eulerscheZahl: si tacuisses pholosophus mansisses
 dbdr: "Thus passes the glory of the world"
 Piemert: can you start a custom match with an opponent of your choice?
 Zenoscave: ah yes mundi
 pb4: I'll just repush
 dbdr: le monde&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: munudus
 eulerscheZahl: mundus
 pb4: same version, but I want to join the party :D
 dbdr: 5 pushes in top 10
 eulerscheZahl: red circle party?
 dbdr: hopefully you manage to climb back to top 10&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: big gap between 10 and 11where did julin dien go?
 Piemert: red circle?
 dbdr: I wonder if the lb refresh slowless only affects display or also the opponent picker
 eulerscheZahl: leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: open a replay in a new tab
 pb4: green arrow party
 dbdr: since that depends on the ranking
 eulerscheZahl: you will see your updated score instantly
 eulerscheZahl: just the UI which is laggy
 kovi: afaik it works ok
 dbdr: oh, so there is a workround :D
 dbdr: need to write an extension to abuse it
 dbdr: 6 red circles
 eulerscheZahl: 2 of them can't be counted as circles yet
 eulerscheZahl: red dots
 pb4: red arrow at 10th place :disappointed:
 dbdr: that basically depends on your last match before the refresh, I think
 dbdr: basically random
 kovi: wala is also on submit...somewhere down
 Zenoscave: 65 last i checked
 dbdr: jolindien arriving back
 wlesavo: basically you can chose only counting players and lb wont change :slight_smile:
 Piemert: how can I start a custom match with an opponent of my choice?
 Quidome: delete one first
 eulerscheZahl: delete the default AI
 kovi: atm you cant, too many games tunning
 Zenoscave: click the delete button under the boss
 eulerscheZahl: that troll kovi :D
 kovi: (just jking)
 Piemert: thanks
 Piemert: only from own league?
 Zenoscave: yes
 Quidome: and below
 Piemert:&#160;:'(
 Quidome: which leage are you in?
 Piemert: silver
 Quidome: I am bottem gold, i can start a match and send you the replay if you want&#160;:)
 Piemert: great&#160;:)
 Quidome: one moment...
 Quidome: how do you get a replay URL from a game played in the IDE?

 Quidome: this one is for you Piemert
 Illedan: 14 days left and y'all pushing like it's 5 min :D
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know yet how it will look like when there are only 5min left
 Zenoscave: is the party still going?
 Piemert: tnx Quidome!
 Piemert: and eulerscheZahl&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: no Zenoscave, you missed the new year fireworks
 Zenoscave: drats
 Piemert:&#160;:( I lost
 Quidome: sorry&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: not sorry
 Quidome: twice I saw...
 Quidome: :D
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 and that's just a resubmit?
 Illedan: I guess the elo drained from siman is a lot now
 pb4: eulerscheZahl and bugfix
 pb4: I hope...
 rwilson: pb4 is there an 'easy' way to find timeouts in your last battles?  I'd seen your bot timeout ( pre-resubmit ) , but can't find it anymore&#160;;)
 MadKnight: no there isn't rwilson timeout information is only written in the huge replay file
 MadKnight: u gotta download a whole replay file to see if it timed out
 rwilson: TY MadKnight&#160;;) was hoping someone might have tooled up such a thing.  I'd noticed it in the ajax resonses for a given battle - put too busy with other things to script it up&#160;;) 
 MadKnight: downloading all battles will be bad for the servers
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, some of us have scripts for that
 MadKnight: they don't want people to use such a tool
 rwilson: If I were to do so, it would only hit it as often as i do manually&#160;;)  i'd hope others would be kind enough to do the same.
 eulerscheZahl: right, downloading a few hundred MB just for checking timeouts is a lot
 MadKnight: u also need to send a query per each relpay
 MadKnight: euler since when are u no more a toad&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: sharks can dive under water
 rwilson: I'm not diving into it anytime soon - but just checking real quick a sample replay from gold is roughly 10k dl right now
 eulerscheZahl: and this is a submarine contest

 orenog_166: ):
 icecream17: an array
 icecream17: '0 0': 'N',   '1 0': 'N',   '5 0': 'N',   '6 0': 'N',   '10 0': 'N',

 Astrobytes: Hey PatrickMcGinnisII, someone did a PHP code bundler for CG, donno if you saw it<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MrTimber/CodingGamePHP">https://github.com/MrTimber/CodingGamePHP</a>
 orenog_166: HELP!
 orenog_166: IN legends-of-code-magic HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M IN THE DRAFT PHASE!?!?!?!?
 wlesavo: pls no caps
 orenog_166: sorry, I need the answer, because I'l amost crying, I don't understand
 Illedan: There is some input giving you that information.
 Illedan: Or, you can count
 orenog_166: there isn't!
 Illedan: Always same amount of cards.
 Illedan: Count it is.
 Astrobytes: "During the Draft phase, playerMana is always 0"
 orenog_166: and it's never 0 in the battle?
 Illedan: No.
 orenog_166: oh
 Astrobytes: No
 orenog_166: so it can be 0 in the battle
 Astrobytes: Read the statement
 orenog_166: you said it's not never 0 in the batt
 orenog_166: le
 Astrobytes: To clarify: It is never 0 in the battle phase
 orenog_166: YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 orenog_166: and am I player 1 or 2?
 orenog_166: like 0 or 1
 orenog_166: who am I?
 orenog_166:&#160;?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?
 icecream17:  0 indexing? So 0=1 and 1=2
 orenog_166: yes, but who am I?!
 orenog_166: Yes
 orenog_166: am I 0 or 1?
 orenog_166: how can i know that?
 Astrobytes: "Integer playerDeck: the number of cards in the player's deck. During the Draft phase, the second player has less card in his deck than his opponent."
 orenog_166: it doesn't help me know if i'm the first or the 2nd
 orenog_166: because I can't check how many cards I have if I don't know if i'm the first of the 2nd
 Astrobytes: "The player's input comes first, the opponent's input comes second."
 orenog_166: OHHHHHHH
 orenog_166: THANK YOUUU
 orenog_166: YOU ARE LEGENDERY!
 orenog_166: YOU SAVED ME FROM SUICIDING
 Astrobytes: Do you actually want me to post the whole statement or would you like to spend some time reading it in it's entirety?
 orenog_166: THANKY OU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 orenog_166: SO I AM THE FIRST!
 orenog_166: I AM THE PLAYER!
 orenog_166: NOW I GOT ITTTT

 orenog_166: YES
 orenog_166: SORRY

 ZarthaxX: ban
 Astrobytes: Zarthid-19 hello
 ZarthaxX: hi astrid-19
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 AntiSquid: idk he seemed interested when i read the previous conversation
 Astrobytes: Perhaps just rather excitable
 AntiSquid: are you still playin ocean of code Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Slowly AntiSquid, got a lot on due to this virus shit, and still not recovered either
 AntiSquid: for real? how many weeks has it been?
 Astrobytes: 4-ish now
 Astrobytes: People are still having symptoms (albeit reduced) after 6 weeks from what I've gathered
 AntiSquid: i don't have any symptoms but was around a few people who coughed .
 AntiSquid: also i heard the coughing only last up to 4 weeks, not 6
 Astrobytes: The fatigue and body aches are atrocious, in my case at least. And I have increasingly bad back pain since the start. Still not sick enough to be tested though ofc. Though emergency assessment center gave 99.999% COVID diagnosis
 AntiSquid: ya i don't get this, "not sick enough for testing", yet i heard about this fatigue and headache symptom from others
 Astrobytes: I'm still coughing but my lungs are clear. Have to watch for phlegm, especially coloured. Viral pneumonia is not like bacterial pneumonia.
 AntiSquid: they called their GP, they were given a sick note, stayed at home 2 weeks and were called back in to work although they still have a dry cough
 AntiSquid: so what exactly do you need to watch out for?
 Astrobytes: I called NHS after 3 weeks, got assessed (eventually) and sent home with advice and probablt diagnosis. My mum did same (some other day) and ssince her cough was worse she got a salbutamol inhaler + spacer to open her airways a bit.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx Astrobytes checking it out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry afk alot, running my laser.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sick, damn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so like 70% of people getting 'dat crap?
 AntiSquid: idk i don't check news, getting tired of how dramatic the news stories are
 Astrobytes: You look out for a serious cough, coloured phlegm, fever (not necessarily on thermometer - hot chest/back is also indicative), difficulty breathing, chest pain, back pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea... I could go on
 AntiSquid: i get it it's bad, but they like to blow things out of proportions even more
 Astrobytes: No, I actually get the impression things are worse in terms of infection levels. Media ofc get the wrong end of the stick and try to sell copies (so to speak)
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII cool, I saw the guy post it the other day and thought you might appreciate it so saved the link
 AntiSquid: you don't believe china recovered?
 AntiSquid: actually didn't check news in a while to see if there's a second wave
 Astrobytes: Didn't mention China. It's kinda hard to conjecture when they're so secretive (relative to other nation's secrecy that is)
 Astrobytes: Was primarily addressing UK spread
 AntiSquid: afaik testing is just slow here
 Astrobytes: afaics they are still pursuing the "herd immunity" strategy
 AntiSquid: lol
 Astrobytes: Intentionally or otherwise.
 AntiSquid: then i hope i don't have symptoms because i am immune
 Astrobytes: In simple terms, I do believe the UK is experiencing what is politely known as a Charlie Foxtrot
 AntiSquid: do you enjoy ocean of code?
 Astrobytes: Not overly no.
 Astrobytes: But I'll still put some effort in.
 AntiSquid: not the best game for a lockdown&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Hey, it's something to do eh
 Astrobytes: We've always got UTG/CR
 AntiSquid: ya well was going to try and improve XR or CR2 
 AntiSquid: especially CR2 since i have 500/5000 points or so 
 Astrobytes: I wasn't keen on that CR2 but things were tricky for me around that time too, probs enjoy it more as a multi
 Astrobytes: Still, 14 days left on this OoC so lots of time left
 Astrobytes: *to work on it
 elderlybeginner: is there a way to use external editor instead of these built-in ones?
 BeardedDidgeridoo_9d92: copy and paste
 elderlybeginner: that's partial solution
 BeardedDidgeridoo_9d92: ok
 Scarfield: elderlybeginner under settings there is this option: "Use an external code editor"
 elderlybeginner: I see some posts about a need for API and some old extension projects. Nothing working
 BeardedDidgeridoo_9d92: good to know thanks
 Scarfield: i dont use it myself, but know others do, i just copy paste
 Asterixk: there is browser addon to enable eternal editor feature
 Asterixk: only know of chrome and firefox support
 The_Duck: the chrome one works great <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>
 elderlybeginner: Scarfield, The_Duck: I don't see mentioned option for use of external editor
 Asterixk: install addon first. then refresh maybe
 Scarfield: When you are in a puzzle/contest IDE, under leaderboard there is settings. In settings in the bottom i have "Use an external code editor", but as mentioned it probably only works with chrome or firefox 
 elderlybeginner: firefox is fine, installed cg local, got error: CG LocalAn error occurred. Make sure the CG Local app is running and try again.
 Asterixk: i had the same issue a few days ago. couldn't fix it, went back to chrome, runs great.
 elderlybeginner: which plugin? there is CG Local and CG Sync
 Asterixk: CG Sync
 elderlybeginner: I cannot find it for firefox; I guess ff + built-in editor is smaller burden for me then chrome + local
 Asterixk: what suits you best. i couldn't let go of VSCode intellisense on typescript
 elderlybeginner: i'm vimer, so it's a bit easier for me, although simple config file could be of help
 icecream17: hmm. two players have 5 lives and are on the same square. should i torpedo myself?
 elderlybeginner: nope, you will show your position and you know position of the opponent, so it's kind of unefficient
 Asterixk: SILENCE S . |MOVE N .. omg..
 Asterixk: SILENCE S 4 |MOVE N .. omg..
 Asterixk: it requires so much upkeep even for 1 look ahead
 Asterixk: better go full sim asap
 MadKnight: hey guys
 MadKnight: how's it going&#160;?
 MadKnight: contest i mean
 Asterixk: or don't SILENCE before MOVE
 Asterixk: hey MAdKnight
 Asterixk: the contest? i'm stuckIt's hard af.Best contest ever
 Asterixk: it looks simple at first. then you dive deeper
 elderlybeginner: I was rewriting the code a few times already, and there are 2 more weeks
 elderlybeginner: unfortunatelly :grin:
 icecream17: I got a new record! 750 actions

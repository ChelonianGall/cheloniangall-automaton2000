 VizGhar: Darleanow because flat_ground_y is not 0
 VizGhar: you are looking for 2 consecutive points with same y coordinate
 VizGhar: (*you should be looking for)
 Darleanow: indeed, this is what i'm looking for
 Darleanow: ok it was bc i used flat_ground instead of land surface

 PainEXE: im losing braincells with some of these puzzles
 PainEXE: the goal is 10 times more confusing than coding the thing
 RoseCoder369: -_-
 RoseCoder369: My friends are forcing me to make another coding thing &amp; I'm already tired. 
 RandomSteve: :o
 RandomSteve: why are they forcing you, give yourself some rest
 NewCoder09: RoseCoder369 what coding thing?
 Darleanow: i hink that cg devs should add a feature matchup,where you get matched with ppl of your level, because playng coc against lvls 20+ is quite unfair lul
 eulerscheZahl: 1. there are clashers with low level but lots of clashes played2. even now there are not enough clashers at times, so CG adds bots to increase the numbers
 eulerscheZahl: 3. not a priority :imp:
 derjack: clash is not priority?
 eulerscheZahl: still no link to the task after you completed a clash
 War12: i just dot know what to do

 NewCoder09: RoseCoder369 what were your friends trying to code 
 NewCoder09: what were they trying to force you to code?
 zakacat: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 RoseCoder369: they were trying to make me play one of the coding games
 RoseCoder369: :neutral_face:
 RoseCoder369: but don't worry. I ignored them &amp; took a nice rest. lol. :relieved:\
 RandomSteve: oh i am glad thanks for answering
 RoseCoder369: np
 RoseCoder369: -v-
 RandomSteve: I just looked at your profile, I am a noob I am learning Java, are you laerning GO?
 PainEXE: i despise go
 PainEXE: all the shortened words are just bad
 NewCoder09: Same
 NewCoder09: Right now I'm learning Java, and Javascript
 NewCoder09: RandomSteve how are youu doig on learning Java
 RoseCoder369: idk what I am learning. lol
 NewCoder09: What language do you normally use?
 NewCoder09: From your page it looks like you wanna learn go
 RoseCoder369: ya 
 RoseCoder369: lol
 KenHuang: anyone aware how to find my clash history? saw a good code previously but forgot to take note
 RoseCoder369: no sorry
 5DN1L: KenHuang check past notifications
 KenHuang: hmm..click on notification it just redirect back to home page
 KenHuang: anyway, all coding looks better than mine, i will just take note going forward, hope can write by myself oneday
 5DN1L: Did you click SHOW READ?
 a-Rye: Whenever you finish a clash (the time runs out), you'll get a notification of your rank for that clash. If you click that, you go back to the results page for that clash
 Kaelidian: KenHuang, I'm a newbie and I'm making steady progress by just staying at it till I'm sick of it, going to sleep getting up and doing it again.
 NewCoder09: Thats good
 NewCoder09: but you don't have to do it all day to get good at it 
 RandomSteve: @NewCoder09 I'm glad to know I am not the only one
 RandomSteve: lol
 Kaelidian: True, but I'm obsessed with Game Of Drones right now lol
 KenHuang: i can see past notification but somehow it just open a new tab and stay in home page, maybe let me try antoher browser
 RandomSteve: so I mean how can I say this uhmm
 Kaelidian: I've built a genetic algorithm for it, but I can't keep TID updated so my drones aren't learning from correct info
 Kaelidian: They dumb 
 Kaelidian: but still placed me 217, so they're still smarter than a lot of people that couldn't get their drones to move lol
 RandomSteve: I mean I am learning lots of new stuff, new commands which I like calling tools, new solutions, in clashes I see even in other languages I am someties able to understand  other's solutions and learn new ways of doing virtually infinite amounts of stuff
 5DN1L: that's good, RandomSteve
 RandomSteve: thank you sdn
 Kaelidian: Yeah, but don't collect tools just for tools sake, think of an artisians workshop. He has exactly what he needs and no extra clutter. Learn by doing 
 5DN1L: skills are perfected over time
 RandomSteve: can you really get to know too many tools?
 Kaelidian: yeah
 RandomSteve: thanks for the tip kaelidan
 Kaelidian: if you spend all your time buying tools, you have a garage full of them with no projects ever done
 RandomSteve: lol that's true
 Kaelidian: Pick you a project, and get in there and learn as you go 
 RandomSteve: I actually use tools irl this is a perfect analogy lol
 RoseCoder369: -v-
 RoseCoder369: I have a qusetion that i am always stuck on
 RandomSteve: I really never tought of it that way
 Kaelidian: Im the same way, I've got grinders I hardly ever use and such but my projects are all laying around mid completion
 Kaelidian: cuz I'm coding lol
 RandomSteve: wow
 RandomSteve: shoot the question Rose
 RoseCoder369: if you had to put okay in it but now you have to do AHHHHHHHh. How do you do tha t
 Kaelidian: Are you talking about a challenge on the website?
 RandomSteve: yaeh I had that challenge before
 RandomSteve: don't remember what it was tho
 RoseCoder369: ya
 Kaelidian: Make two string variables
 Kaelidian: if you need one, use it, else, use the other
 RoseCoder369: k
 RoseCoder369: thx
 RandomSteve: if you have more question make sure to ask them
 Kaelidian: Or you could have a genetic algorithm generate characters and concatenate them together, but don't get ahead of yourself like I have lol 
 RoseCoder369: okay thx
 Kaelidian: yw
 RandomSteve: ok so I know you are learning go I guess. The way I print stuff in Java is with this comand System.out.println ("here you print whatever you want like AAAHH or ok");
 Kaelidian: which language are you using Rose
 RandomSteve: and it has this comment "//answer goes here" generally so you can use that if you don't know where to write your answer
 RandomSteve: "I know I guess" RandomSteve 2022
 Kaelidian: I'm a c# , c++, newbie
 Kaelidian: but want to learn python eventually
 PainEXE: start with python
 PainEXE: easiest syntax
 Kaelidian: Im in class for c# already. Syntax doesn't scare me, I've been around a few years drooling at the window lol
 Kaelidian: I used to troubleshoot code for secondlife, rust, Arma 3, etc
 Wontonimo: focus on 1 language until you are able to do things like recursion, flood-fill, memoization, and mini-max.  Until then spreading yourself across different programming languages isn't going to help your development much
 Askelardd: 緊急説明
 Askelardd: 緊急説明
 a-Rye: ^^ Yup. I studied with Java for a year and a half in university before we were introduced to C++. And then there's Python, easiest of them all. But it's good to know something other than Python so you understand array boundaries, variable type issues, etc
 Askelardd: 緊急説明
 Wontonimo: don't spam Askelardd.  last warning
 Askelardd: Sim senhor
 Wontonimo: Use English in this channel Askelardd.
 Askelardd: srry
 Mindarius: take tacos
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Kaelidian: Yeah I'm focusing on c# right now
 1mpossible_c: After I learn C# and learn the basics of programming, I wanna learn a low level language
 1mpossible_c: because software written in low level languages always fascinates me
 1mpossible_c: mods
 1mpossible_c: something is wrong
 1mpossible_c: I will write a swear word so mods will come

 jacek:&#160;:(
 1mpossible_c: aww
 jacek: so, low level C#?
 1mpossible_c: nah bro assembly for example
 Wontonimo: not low level enough, PLA all the way
 1mpossible_c: codingame forcefully teaching me maths
 1mpossible_c: it's really fun tho
 1mpossible_c: imagine if companies hired anybody that has a certain level in codingame
 1mpossible_c: I am jsut a beginner so I only got 4 lol
 RoseCoder369: i'm a beginner too and i only got a 3 lol
 RoseCoder369: -v-
 1mpossible_c: bro fix chat
 1mpossible_c: in middle of coding, it suddenly starts typing in chat
 1mpossible_c: = 
 1mpossible_c:&#160;:/
 1mpossible_c:&#160;;
 ycsvenom: what?
 ycsvenom: you end your line
 ycsvenom:&#160;;
 1mpossible_c: bro I ended my line and pressed enter while coding
 1mpossible_c: that sh*t wrote it in chat
 1mpossible_c: super annoying
 ycsvenom: that's weird
 ycsvenom: i just finished a CoC nothing happens for me
 1mpossible_c: it says connection restarting
 1mpossible_c: then does that
 ycsvenom: does chat has a shortcut?
 1mpossible_c: it's not shortcut
 ycsvenom: why don't ask a mod?
 ycsvenom: like Wontonimo
 ycsvenom: i don't know if i wrote that correctly
 1mpossible_c: wow. such a tough round that only one person completed it
 1mpossible_c: make it 2 lol
 1mpossible_c: in the last 20 seconds
 1mpossible_c: wow. I got 2nd place amongst 8 people for the first time! 
 1mpossible_c: last time I got 1 out of 2
 ycsvenom: what was the question
 ycsvenom: problem*
 RoseCoder369: -_-
 1mpossible_c: it was just a very simple maths equation lol
 ycsvenom: what exactly was it -_-
 RoseCoder369: lol
 1mpossible_c: I don't remember -_-
 ycsvenom: woooooooooooooooooooow
 1mpossible_c: why are you acting like this
 ycsvenom: like what?!
 1mpossible_c: ok bro.
 ycsvenom: i don't understand
 RoseCoder369: lol
 ycsvenom: why did you quit!
 Wontonimo: please use the #clash channel to discuss clash related topics
 RoseCoder369: lol
 RoseCoder369: why
 RoseCoder369:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: because that is that is the proper place for it, or in your specific custom clash chat channel
 Wontonimo: that is created when you join a clash
 RoseCoder369: -_-
 RoseCoder369: I'm only a 7th grader. I don't know a lot about stuff. lol.
 ycsvenom: nice cat btw RoseCoder369
 RoseCoder369: Thx

 ycsvenom: still beautiful
 RoseCoder369: thx
 Aimless_: dododada
 ycsvenom: 361th

 jacek: hm?
 Wontonimo: what's all this number thing about ycsvenom?  Is it our class rank out of 400&#160;?
 ycsvenom: no i am finally from the top 400 in CoC
 ycsvenom: maybe if i played 3 or 4 times a day i can be the first&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: you are 8449th overall
 Wontonimo: you can improve that ranking doing a multi, like Tron
 RoseCoder369: lol
 RoseCoder369: I have a question
 Wontonimo: here is the Tron puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing</a>
 RoseCoder369: if you had to put 20 down but then the next test i had to put down 67. what do i do then.
 Wontonimo:&#160;? what
 RoseCoder369: If you are doing a clash and then for example you have to change the answer to 20 for the first test but then for the test 2, you have to put 67 in instead of 20. What do I do then?
 Mindarius: Are you hard-coding your responses?
 Wontonimo: sounds like it
 RoseCoder369: idk
 RoseCoder369: lol
 RoseCoder369: i think so
 RoseCoder369: -v-

 jacek: yes, its also a hiring platform
 jacek: some companies use it to test candidates
 RoseCoder369: -_- 
 RoseCoder369: ya
 Mindarius: You need to do the math in the code rather than doing it yourself
 RoseCoder369: which math though
 Uljahn: Maccas: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a> 
 Mindarius: you calculated the answers, right?
 RoseCoder369: ya
 RoseCoder369: -v-
 Mindarius: that math
 RoseCoder369: oh
 RoseCoder369: ok
 RoseCoder369: thx
 Uljahn: the answer should involve l and s
 Mindarius: Lily's speed gets stored into s
 Mindarius: the length of the forest gets stored into l
 Mindarius: remember that l is in meters, and s is in centimeters per second
 RoseCoder369: ok
 Mindarius: Do you know how to do the math in your code?
 RoseCoder369: kind of
 jacek: or in real life
 RoseCoder369: yes
 jacek: oO
 RoseCoder369: im only a kid&#160;:/
 RoseCoder369: lol
 Mindarius: That's fine, you're learning, that's good
 RoseCoder369: ya lol -v-
 Mindarius: If you need help with any of the programming ask in chat, or there are plenty of good tutorial/documentation websites
 RoseCoder369: okay thank you 
 Wontonimo: if you have access to youtube, look up "the coding train intro tutorial to programming"
 Wontonimo: very good quality videos about intro to programming from that creator
 RoseCoder369: alright
 RoseCoder369: thank you so much for helping
 Wontonimo: hey ycsvenom , can I get you interested in a bot battle&#160;?  
 ycsvenom: which one?
 Wontonimo: Tron&#160;?  No very many controls, up down left right 
 jacek: b a start
 Wontonimo: what jacek&#160;?
 Mindarius: he was referencing the konami code
 Mindarius: famous cheat code
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: i know no such things :sad-face-of-youth-filled-with-biking:
 jacek: :older_man:
 ycsvenom: which botbattle do you have in mind Wontonimo?
 jacek: line racing aka tron
 ycsvenom: so a "multi-snake" game
 Wontonimo: what are you interested in?  Physics, board games, or more of classic game (tron, pacman)
 NewCoder09: hello
 Wontonimo: hey hey coder09
 Wontonimo: ycsvenom , it was called Tron well before the concept of "multi snake"
 ycsvenom: yes i want to tryall of it but board games the most
 Wontonimo: connect 4 is super easy to get into
 NewCoder09: Hey ycsvenom
 ycsvenom: which game came first
 ycsvenom: hi NewCoder09
 NewCoder09: Wontonimo I haven't even started connect 4
 Wontonimo: lmgtfy ycsvenom which game came first, tron or snake
 antiwonto: [auto] hey ycsvenom let me google that for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=which+game+came+first,+tron+or+snake">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=which+game+came+first,+tron+or+snake</a>
 ycsvenom: i will try connect 4  before tron
 Wontonimo: looks like Blockade (like tron) came first, then the single player version (snake)
 ycsvenom: yeah so snake is single tron 
 NewCoder09: I mean thats what i got from looking at yall's messages
 jacek: do you want some connect 4 memes?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv">https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv</a> comments

 ycsvenom: Wontonimowe can use the chess engines method for connect 4what do you think?
 Wontonimo: you mean minimax&#160;?
 ycsvenom: sorry i forgot that that it's name :disappointed_relieved:
 Wontonimo: like, check all your next moves against all counter moves against all counter counter moves and so on&#160;?
 ycsvenom: yes i really forgot it's name
 ycsvenom: do you play chess?
 Wontonimo: YEAH&#160;!  Great idea ycsvenom, that's definitely a great thing to uuse for connect 4&#160;!
 jacek: chess programming wiki for the win
 Wontonimo: I play very casually.  I'm bad at it.
 ycsvenom: do you want to play one now?
 Wontonimo: no
 ycsvenom: :relaxed:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess</a> hm?
 Wontonimo: I like where there is beer involved, and it is in person, and it is at the cottage on a rainy day.
 Wontonimo: do you know how to code minimax ycsvenom&#160;?
 ycsvenom: no actually i never code it before but i know the idea of itso i can translate it to code
 Wontonimo: there is a twist to it called negamax which imho is easier to code
 ycsvenom: i will about both starting with negamax as it's easier 
 ycsvenom: read*
 jacek: no matter what, universally you'd need to make game simulator

 Passifi: anyone got any pointers how to optimize it is find maybe to slow&#160;? I think this should deliver the right result but it is still too slow... :expressionless:
 jacek: do you have pragmas
 Passifi: no
 jacek: first lines, before the includes
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,unroll-loops,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 jacek: not that it would help if the algorithm itself is slow
 Passifi: for the memoiyation i pushed all combination that were found on to a vector and use find() to check whether they are in there I guess I can't write a faster find() than the guys who wrote the std libs, so maybe using map would help&#160;? I guess I try to rewrite it like that 
 Passifi: and make note of that dirty secret jacek shared with me&#160;;)
 Passifi: and removing the cerr commands gave me another passed test case ^^

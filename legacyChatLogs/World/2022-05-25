 Aympab: Hi guys, anyone has advice on memoisation&#160;? I feel like it's not as useful as it seems. Take the Fibonacci example (on wikipedia), it is WAY longer for the hardware to compute a '*' than to go in memory look for the result. Am I getting the memoisation wrong&#160;? Or is Fibonnaci just a too simple example to really see the good effects of this pattern&#160;? 
 Aympab: Sorry I meant the other way around, it is way longer to get the value in memory
 Aympab: I feel like it is useful only if computing the function takes longer than going in memory, which is not a common case
 Ayza: as the definition says "an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again."
 Ayza: you wouldn't wanna keep executing the same long function over and over for the same input
 Ayza: Instead check if it has already been computed before and return the result
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://devinduct.com/blogpost/60/memoization-boost-your-code-performance">https://devinduct.com/blogpost/60/memoization-boost-your-code-performance</a>
 Aympab: Yes but, just checking to memory takes so long to the hardware. I just feel like this pattern is too much known for what it is actually useful
 Ayza: well, that would take milliseconds to check if the same input is inside of a dictionary and return it's value
 Ayza: better than spending seconds to return the same output
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Aympab recursive functions when you are looking at serious depth...like &gt;10k that are called repeatedly benefit from memo.  Even fib(10000) is like 10k additions linearly ... which is much more than a lookup.  if your memory is structered correctly, the pointer and value are easily peeked.
 Aympab: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://deeplearningsystems.ai/#ch07/">https://deeplearningsystems.ai/#ch07/</a> look at the second figure, a RAM read takes to much longer than computing
 Aympab: Mmmh ok I see
 5DN1L: you test your actual code to determine if memoisation helps or not
 Aympab: Yes ofc
 Aympab: Nice discussion guys thanks
 Aympab: :grin:

 zakacat: Makes sense
 jacek: there are separate achievements for using many languages

 5DN1L: you can do the same or different problems
 zakacat: but it won't show up on my list of programming languages?
 5DN1L: it will show
 zakacat: Let me re word my question. I want to learn new languages, but I think it would be easier to start by rewriting my completed solutions I have already. Will I get any XP or achievements or will it show up on my profile as a new language with a completed puzzle.
 zakacat:&#160;?
 5DN1L: you won't get extra XP except from the achievements

 5DN1L: and it will show up on your profile
 5DN1L: check my profile as an example

 zakacat: Jesus Christ

 zakacat: Nice, do you feel like an exceptional programmer at this point?
 5DN1L: nope lol
 5DN1L: I know just bare basics of other languages
 zakacat: Are our profiles a reasonable representation of our skills?
 zakacat: hmm, right
 zakacat: but the basics are still great to have
 5DN1L: what's your goal then, zakacat?
 Wammi: Absolute beginner learning the basics here. I'd like to eventually play with game dev using godot or unity (haven't decided which yet). Cany anyone recommend a language I should start to get comfortable with first? 
 BobLob: Unity is either Javascript or C#, so one of those if you go the Unity route
 Parzival1372: i think python 3
 BobLob: It seems Godot supports C# as well, so there's that crossover point.
 Parzival1372: but JavaScript is good to

 struct: what is it?
 DomiKo: MC :D
 struct: o.o
 DomiKo: I have TODO: to write GA for it
 jacek: only DQN with replaybuffer and target network
 struct: Guess I'll try MC before trying smtisimax
 DomiKo: have you tried prioritized replay buffer?
 jacek: no
 jacek: probably something missing. i should have decent results with what i got, like those csb guys
 DomiKo: prioritized RB helped me a lot in CSV
 DomiKo: CSB*
 jacek: and before that it didnt work?
 DomiKo: I will find some graphs
 DomiKo: give me a minute

 DomiKo: I believe that our implementation at the time wasn't the best, but little change did change a lot
 struct: check there liam
 jacek: liam1234 some bots have referee
 jacek: DomiKo thanks
 jacek: ddqn is dueling dqn? or just dqn + target network
 DomiKo: Yes dueling

 lightning_bolt: ‚ÄòSup guys, My name is Quandale Dingle. I am breaking out of prison on may 14, 2023. I am currently imprisoned in southern Saudi Arabia for various felonies including but not limited to; Public indecency, public masturbation, urinating on a police officer and treason.
 lightning_bolt: What's up guys! It's Quandale Dingle here! (RUUEHEHEHEHEHEEHE) I have been arrested for multiple crimes (AHHHHHHHHHHHHH)
 lightning_bolt: When I was 10 years old my goofy ahh uncle tried to get me to touch his weenie dude!My mom caught him and beat him with a pan.I created an explosive bomb and put it in my sister‚Äôs lunch box, and blew her to smithereens.
 lightning_bolt: I put Viagra in my goofy ahh uncle‚Äôs drink and he tried to do bad things to me.I drowned in the bathtub when I was 15 years old.I sold my grandpa‚Äôs crutches and he fell down the stairs and broke his back. OHGREATHEAVENS!My dad gave me a knuckle sandwich full force. OHSHIT!
 lightning_bolt: Hey! Quandale Dingle here. I just escaped prison! I am staying at my friend Juandale Pringle‚Äôs house. As I was running away from cops, I fell and scraped my foreskin off. A guy named Garfield Jenson bent me over in the shower while I was in prison. WHATAREYOUDOING! My baby mama Shaniqua Anderson told me to pay child support, so I gave my baby to creepy old guys.
 lightning_bolt: My crazy ahh uncle watching sis loves me and inappropriate stepmom videos in the bathroom. WHATAREYOUDOINGSTEPMOM? I put a fork in the electrical outlet and blew my hand off. My brother, Linguini, put liquid laxatives in my grandpa‚Äôs dentures. He shit his brains out! OHGOODNESSGRACIOUS!
 SUwUn: What the hell happened here
 mchouai: hello people
 Wontonimo: lightning_bolt, you have been given a time out.  Don't spam.  The next action will be a ban.  You are welcome to come back after your time out.
 SUwUn: Hi @mchoui
 SUwUn: mchouai**
 SUwUn: I wish this had replies and tags like Discord
 SUwUn: shame
 Wontonimo: SUwUn , if you mentions someone's name the text for them is red
 Wontonimo: you don't need the "@" in front of their name
 Wontonimo: and you can use [tab] to auto-complete user names SUwUn
 SUwUn: Wontonimo bro that's awesome
 SUwUn: thanks for letting me know that
 Ayza: didn't know about the tab thing
 SUwUn: That's so QOL
 SUwUn: Amazing
 SUwUn: I absolutely died on one of the puzzles
 SUwUn: I make things way too over complicated and hurt my brain
 Wontonimo: what puzzle?
 Wontonimo: hey Ayza, thanks for finding that typo in the "Sticky Keyboard" puzzle
 Ayza: you're welcome
 Wontonimo: did you solve it?
 Ayza: yeah, was a fun puzzle
 Wontonimo: cool :grin:
 Ayza: and got me the machine learning badge
 Ayza: skill*
 Wontonimo: you may also like this other puzzle I made <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/markov-text-generation">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/markov-text-generation</a>
 Wontonimo: it has a machine learning flavour to it
 Ayza: oh I am starting to like these type of puzzles
 Ayza: I'll check it out, thanks
 Wontonimo: what?  you solved Mars 3 cave dweller?  What was your algo to do it?
 Ayza: lol that puzzle, I didn't actually solve it
 Wontonimo: I did a mix of flood fill to make a reward path, a few heuristics, and a simple GA to pick from the heuristics at run time to find the best one for the situation
 Wontonimo: what?  How did you get the cave dweller badge then?
 Ayza: I meant the solution isn't mine
 Ayza: I was rushing to get the very hard achievement a month ago or something
 Wontonimo: tisk tisk 
 FloppaPapa: i kept testing all of them instead of testing them individually 
 Wontonimo: don't do that, it spoils the fun (for you)
 FloppaPapa: :upside_down:
 Ayza: true, I still regret it
 Wontonimo: I'd be lying if I said I didn't do that in the early days
 FloppaPapa: I've never coded in my life
 FloppaPapa: only done hour of code in like elementary
 FloppaPapa: so i guess technically 
 Wontonimo: this is not a good site to start your journey
 Wontonimo: try this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://open.kattis.com/">https://open.kattis.com/</a> FloppaPapa
 Wontonimo: and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://exercism.org/tracks">https://exercism.org/tracks</a>
 Wontonimo: do you have an idea of which language to learn FloppaPapa&#160;?
 FloppaPapa: thinking javascript 
 Wontonimo: cool, you can do neat web based things with it (and server, and database)
 Wontonimo: I made this prototype of a game in plain javascript <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/">http://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/</a>
 FloppaPapa: what's the diference between java and javascript
 Wontonimo: Once upon a time there were two languages, java and activescript.  Java caught on and got a lot of buzz.  So the makers of activescript rebranded and called activescript javascript
 Wontonimo: in order to get on the buzz wagon and confuse people
 FloppaPapa: interesting
 Ayza: do I necessarily need to understand state machines to solve the puzzle you sent Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: i don't think so Ayza.  But with so many named things in programming, the name sounds more fancy than what it actually is.  You've probably already implemented a state machine but just didn't realize it
 FloppaPapa: that game you made is pretty cool!
 Ayza: I see, thanks
 lightning_bolt: Hey, Wontonimo I'm sorry I didn't know that anyone was online and I will not do it again.
 Wontonimo: lol
 lightning_bolt: shut yo ass up you white cracker
 lightning_bolt: soryr
 lightning_bolt: sorry
 Wontonimo: well, the apology earned you one more warning.  next is a ban
 Ayza: trolling I see
 Wontonimo: you've been given a second time out
 Wontonimo: yeah, most likely
 FloppaPapa: how long did the prototype game take to make
 Wontonimo: it was a weekend, then some tweaking here and there.
 Wontonimo: if you are going to do javascript (it's a great language) then consider watching some "Coding Train" videos on youtume
 Wontonimo: youtube
 FloppaPapa: alright, I haven't many coding youtubers to watch to i'll check them out
 BobLob: Coding Train is very nice.
 Wontonimo: here is another javascript resource <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript</a>
 LeJordy: codecademy üíÄ
 SUwUn: :cry:
 Wontonimo: they used to have free lessons.  Don't know about their paid stuff.  I wouldn't pay
 Husoski: Wontonimo I've heard of early JS versions called "Mocha" or "LiveScript", but not ActionScript.
 Wontonimo: ive been wrong before, changes are that i'll be wrong again
 Husoski: oh yeah...actionscript was the scripting language used for Flash...developed by Macromedia and then swallowed and killed by Adobe.
 FloppaPapa: Wontonimo how did you learn coding? were you self taught or did you learn in school?
 Wontonimo: both.  started when i was 8yr.  then went to Uni and got a 4 year degree in computer engineering
 Wontonimo: you don't need to do that though
 Wontonimo: my neighbour is 41 and just started learning half a year ago and now has a job doing it.
 Wontonimo: it was an internal transfer, not a totally new hire (to be clear)
 Wontonimo: how about you FloppaPapa, what has you interested in programming?
 Westicles: you got two weeks to port the taco bot
 FloppaPapa: idk coding just seems like a very cool skill to have and I'd like how to make things and know how things work
 FloppaPapa: I wanted to know how people made whole games and programs with coding
 CarajoRosa: I would have learned actionscript if flash didn't die x,d
 DOMINER: there is a dark mode?
 DOMINER: i'm burning
 DOMINER: with the white white plus
 TuND: hello world!
 TuND: im gay
 Wild_Python: TuND&#160;:)))
 ASM_MOV_INT: got tacos?
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 ASM_MOV_INT: I just put a transparent powershell window over the screen.
 gokubill: hello
 ASM_MOV_INT: what's happening coder?
 ASM_MOV_INT: i feel like that's a great intro to a video game ai greeting you!

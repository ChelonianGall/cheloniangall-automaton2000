 eulerscheZahl: no
 jlfu10: ok
 ZarthaxX: toad awake already??
 aCat: hi, euler what's so eraly&#160;?
 aCat: :D
 codecodecodecodecodecode: why i can not use SURFACE in Wood 2 league
 chucknorris: hi anyone using zobrist hash&#160;?
 aCat: hmm, In W2 you should
 aCat: remember that comands have to bye separated by | codecodecodecodecodecode
 rwilson: chucknorris you suspect zobrist hasihing might help with OOC&#160;?   i'm slightly doubtful .... 
 rwilson:&#160;;) good thought though.    some optimizations i've been looking at are KINDA OF in that directinon .. not sure if others have done so
 chucknorris: I use it already. but I think I it wrong. I hash everything, visited cell, hp, etc. I'm not sure if the move left, right and move right left should result in the same hash in this case
 rwilson: the reasone i'd have slight doubts.. is that  a 'position' in OOC isn't quite the same as in something like chess or go ..    the position of OOC is not the full state of things...  
 chucknorris: I keep track of path and mine positions too
 eulerscheZahl: why early aCat? 6:30 am when i wrote that. 7am now after breakfast
 dbdr: sun is up&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 aCat: heh
 eulerscheZahl: the early toad catches the fly
 rwilson: chucknorris ... it does sound like you've taken most of the extra into account...&#160;;) perhaps compatriots in legend league migth be willing to chat with you at some point on it..     ( for me , i'd be doing the same as you roughly  if i did ..   position, prior moves, current health,etc.. 
 aCat: damn I download AIStar source and try to run it but cannot compile cause of codingame dependancies...;/
 dbdr: what's AIStart aCat?
 dbdr: AIStar
 aCat: the old Magus optimization  CG competition 
 dbdr: some words are hard to type, too close to those hardcoded in the fingers :D
 aCat: I want to make some optim puzzle so I needed a background
 dbdr: A*Craft?
 aCat: damn
 aCat: :D
 aCat: yep, messed the name
 dbdr: np&#160;:)
 dbdr: I thought it was some kind of meta AI framework
 eulerscheZahl: your own optim game? will it be on CG when you are done?
 eulerscheZahl: i somehow ended up on alibaba when i searched for AIStar
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: aCat's skillful in distracting players by throwing made up names we need to search for
 aCat: small exercise for AI students
 aCat: that's my strategy&#160;! :D
 eulerscheZahl: i give this 5 out of 7 deathstars
 aCat: I give configuring SDK 8 out of 7 deathstars
 aCat: reimported maven projects, have CG in external libraries
 aCat: cannot resolve symbol ...
 aCat: jay it's working
 aCat: 3rd try on euler's bender puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: it was never supposed to be hard to get 100% correctness&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but congrats on solving it now
 eulerscheZahl: i know that some players struggled with it
 SabertheLost: Lol, my broken DFS that only moves and uses silence got promted to silver league&#160;:)
 kovi: bender4 is harder than it seems
 eulerscheZahl: space maze is way harder
 codecodecodecodecodecode: what MOVE direction POWER for&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Power is what ability you charge
 Nerchio: aCat
 aCat: ke?
 Nerchio: why are you so many from university of wroclaw
 Nerchio: you have a group or same class?
 aCat: we made this contest as a bonus list for AI classes
 Q12: How i get the input  about nextCheckpointAngle  in the game Coders Strike Back&#160;?
 Q12: they say in the game that i can use this var but they didnt give me input on him
 Q12: can you help me please?
 tutubalin: i remember there was a site where i can see graph of my stading in contest
 tutubalin: is it still alive? can you give me a link?
 yfprojects: Hello
 yfprojects: @Q12 In which league?
 Q12: Wood 2 League
 yfprojects: In which language?
 Q12: c#
 yfprojects: Line 27
 Q12: i dont understand
 Q12: Do you mean to this?// Edit this line to output the target position
 yfprojects: What about you just send a screenshot or copy-paste your code into chat?!
 Q12: Ok

 yfprojects: Thats how it should be in Bronze.
 yfprojects: But there shouldn't be that many differences.
 AntiSquid: tutubalin i am not sure if you mean Azkellas graph website, or you mean dbdr tools <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dbdr.github.io/cg/">https://dbdr.github.io/cg/</a>
 struct: Q12 you still here?
 Q12: yes
 struct: you figured it out yet?
 Q12: You helped me a lot thank you
 Q12: yes
 struct: Nice, at that league you needed to press reset my code
 struct: so it gives you the inputs
 Q12: ahh
 tutubalin: AntiSquid i don't remember which one, but i could choose contest, my name and see chart of my place
 tutubalin: dbdr doesn't load
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/</a>
 yfprojects: This one?
 Q12: but i stiil dont understand why they didnt  give me "thrust". Should they? 
 yfprojects: dbdr's tool doesn't load for me too.
 tutubalin: yfprojects can i see my graph on magusgeek?
 tutubalin: i mean not just the current standing, but history of it
 dbdr: I think the one with the graph was from a french guy, don't remember the url, but this stopped being updated a few months ago I think
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl sent the url yesterday
 tutubalin: ok, thanks
 tutubalin: but basically what i need is to see the history of my standing. i submitted a new version of my bot and i forgot to see how previous version performed.
 dbdr: tutubalin you might be able to dig the history from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/challenge/ocean-of-code.tsv">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/challenge/ocean-of-code.tsv</a>
 dbdr: it's updated once every night
 struct: dbd ive taken a look
 struct: and is not very simple to create the website and navigate
 Nerchio: hey guys
 Nerchio: you can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn
 Nerchio: means you can't do both actions in the same turn, or it is about that mine you've placed?
 YannT: you can't trigger a mine you've just placed
 YannT: you can trigger another and put a mine
 AntiSquid: how do i better visualize, multiple paths&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i mean paths that include silence
 AntiSquid: kinda hard to tell i keep track of all / eliminate all 
 Nerchio: yea it's hard to debug&#160;:(
 Valdemar: AntiSquid i use pseudographics
 Valdemar: right in stderr
 Valdemar: It looks like this, '*' mine position, 'x' enemy possible position, '^' island
 Valdemar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5deb3f25-25c0-4827-80ea-cf2620903824">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5deb3f25-25c0-4827-80ea-cf2620903824</a>
 AntiSquid: yes i do something similar, but was wondering about a way to visualize all visited cell paths along with all silences :D
 Valdemar: I guess pseudographics is not an option here
 blasterpoard: Valdemar that doesn't look too well if mines can be almost everywhere
 Valdemar: blasterpoard I use positions where mines were placed instead and print only those with high probability
 blasterpoard: Valdemar try this game, aroung frame 105 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/448409480">https://www.codingame.com/replay/448409480</a>
 blasterpoard: it should look messy
 Valdemar: i cannot play game from ide, but it will print nothing, because all those mines positions is uncertain
 YannT: why do you do a turn with just "SURFACE" blasterpoard :p
 blasterpoard: YannT I already told you my bot is bad
 blasterpoard: it does some things really well and some other things really badly
 YannT: just surfacing as an entire turn should maybe not even be considered
 blasterpoard: but I'm proud that there's an emergent behavior that makes it fill a rectangle at the beginning of the game
 YannT: yes that's good moving&#160;:)
 Valdemar: you print future movements blasterpoard?
 blasterpoard: Valdemar kinda
 YannT: I prefer to think of it as the bot screaming
 YannT: SWEEEEENNDS
 Valdemar: I try to figure out better movement system, it looks like bruteforce doesn't go well
 Valdemar: it can reach only depth 4-5
 blasterpoard: I like that when it's about to surface, it soemtimes goes "WEWEWE..."
 YannT: :D
 blasterpoard: I won't comment much on my depth, only that it's more than max message length
 blasterpoard: so I only print the first 20
 YannT: I'm still not sure how useful that actually is tho
 blasterpoard: it's useful in some situations
 blasterpoard: and very dependant on how I evaluate the paths
 blasterpoard: current eval is basically tron
 blasterpoard: with some mine avoidance
 Valdemar: do you use some tricks to speedup floodfill calculations?
 blasterpoard: Valdemar what floodfill? there is no floodfill
 Valdemar: you said about tron eval, it doesn't contains floodfill?
 blasterpoard: I have enough depth that I don't care about how many squares are reachable xD
 blasterpoard: so I just take the length of the path
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/448415476">https://www.codingame.com/replay/448415476</a>-.-
 YannT: ahah
 blasterpoard: frame 152 is bad as well
 Illedan: Maybe, not sure how many possible positions you can be at
 Illedan: And you are not deterministic -.-
 YannT: probably doesn't know where you are exactly otherwise yeah it's bad
 blasterpoard: Illedan 1 position, you hit me with your prevoius torpedo
 Illedan: wt
 Illedan: f
 Illedan: thx
 blasterpoard: the legend bots are so bad and people complain about strong gold boss...
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: I know
 Illedan: But I guess that will change during the comming week
 blasterpoard: it's just a really good game that can keep us busy for a month (thx)
 YannT: we all do silly mistakes yeah
 YannT: some more than others (me :D )
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I have 1 version on CG and a fully reworked one offline, which doesn't work fully yet. Losing my sanity over modifying code with different styles xD
 blasterpoard: I'm writing a combat sim finally, to replace my "if (averageDmg&gt;0.75) shoot()"
 YannT: I love it, combat sim
 YannT: sounds very starship troopers :D
 YannT: ENGAGE COMBAT SIM
 YannT: (it shiould shout that in MSG actually)
 kovi: on my list, but only achievable when "one vs. one"
 YannT: or minmax style
 blasterpoard: depends on what kind of sim it is
 YannT: take the worst possible outcome based on his different possible paths
 blasterpoard: why worst?
 YannT: minimax
 blasterpoard: the opponent couldn't have known whcih path to choose 20 turns ago to max his chances now
 YannT: no but you minmax against all his possible positions
 YannT: so you consider the worst one for you
 blasterpoard: why would I consider the worst position, if my opponent can't choose it?
 blasterpoard: that would be way too pessimistic
 YannT: because you don't know where he is, so you've got to assume he's where it's the worst for you out of the possible positions?
 blasterpoard: ok, so you can kill your opponent in 9 positions (3x3 square), or you think he's 1 square away from range
 blasterpoard: because the last option is worst, you save the torpedo
 blasterpoard: and die
 blasterpoard: if he's close
 blasterpoard: sounds really smart
 YannT: good point you probably maybe wanna remove outlyers when considering positions
 blasterpoard: nah, you just don't want that kind of minimax
 YannT: maybe you're right and that's why I never got that to work&#160;:)
 YannT: I actually coded it and then trashed it all
 YannT: could never get it to work decently
 pb4: it *can* work
 pb4: tricky though
 YannT: didn't manage to get anything good out of it, but I'm sure it's still a good way to go
 YannT: just needs someone smarter than me to get an eval that works
 Illedan: :thinking:
 MatthiasDepuydt: ea  
 jrke: corona
 jrke: have you guys heard about meteorite coming on 29th April,2020 near Earth or May hit Earth
 tutubalin: "near Earth" in journalist's slang means "farther than Moon"
 Uljahn: and "may hit Earth" means 0.01% probability
 dbdr: 0.01% would be huge actually
 jrke: do you know dinasour also ended when a virus killing them and a meteorite hitted a earth
 jrke: and same at this time corona andf meteorite
 jrke: is this end of world?
 Uljahn: do you know the contest ends in 7d20h?
 jrke: yes
 AntiSquid: news always dramatize things
 AntiSquid: the headlines will be "we were 1 inch away from disaster"
 AntiSquid: jrke so your conclusion is that the ancient advanced civilization from legends were actually dino-people civilizations?
 dbdr: 1 (light) second from disaster
 jrke: yes
 AntiSquid: bet dino people were cool
 jrke: dinosours ended in the same situations like now 
 jrke: as they were suffering from virus 
 jrke: now its corona
 jrke: and a meteorite ended them
 jrke: now same which is coming towards earth
 Valdemar: why bother with world end in 15 days, when there is contest running which ends in 8 days?
 AntiSquid: so true
 AntiSquid: better 1st in this life time, don't wait to reincarnate jrke
 jrke: ok
 AntiSquid: when legend?
 eulerscheZahl: it opened on Friday, join whenever you want
 jrke: can u tell me a easy bot programming puzzle on codingame except coders strike back
 wlesavo: depends on your commitment, there is no easy ones if you really commit to it
 wlesavo: and almost every puzzle is easy to reach bronze
 blasterpoard: jrke CSB isn't easy; just gold is CSB is the same as bronze in other multis, because it is a tutorial
 eulerscheZahl: the descent is easy
 jrke: ok
 jrke: i already completed it anyother puzzle
 kovi: once again i have no idea what helps between top4
 Illedan: And I have no idea what is my best code anymore :shrug:
 Illedan: Guess it is because of spagetti + randomness
 Illedan: Hard to really know unless I start to benchmark a lot
 blasterpoard: this will be even worse guesswork than UTG
 blasterpoard: I guess in a couple of days everyone will fight near-optimally and we'll wonder about what path to take
 jrke: guys just 30 sseconds before there was earthquake in india
 Illedan: I'm happy as long as everyone had a great journey  :D
 jrke: i feel it live
 jrke: guys just 30 sseconds before there was earthquake in india
 AntiSquid: only here for the CP
 jrke: i was in clash of code and same time earthquake
 wlesavo: Illedan it was a great first contest for me, not that hard on search algos and not sim really based, so i could actually make it to legend, never said a proper thx for making it to you guys :slight_smile:
 kovi: still kudos for have python in top20
 jrke: guys any body of you felt earthquake right now
 dbdr: the only interpreted language in legend
 Nerchio: jrke no we are not in india ;p
 AntiSquid: no jrke, but i am a bit far away
 jrke: its not confirmed the epicentre
 jrke: maybe any other country
 AntiSquid: well at least you are well
 AntiSquid: any good safe way to iterate over an array and add / remove members, i know weird question but still ...
 AntiSquid: i mean vector, not array
 blasterpoard: AntiSquid use vectors as little as possible
 AntiSquid: storing possibilities on a path split 
 blasterpoard: the only way kinda-efficient way is to just remember what you want to add/remove and then adding it all at once
 struct: But maybe CSB is one of the easiest to reach legend
 struct: Oh chat scroll
 AntiSquid: ya it is
 jrke: epicentre was my district
 yfprojects: jrke I think you are overreacting a little bit.
 AntiSquid: don't think so, imagine the earthquake was stronger, we wouldn't even know why he went offline
 wlesavo: yfprophets
 yfprojects:&#160;???
 yfprojects: I thought he was okay?
 wlesavo: nwm, just though it was funny in context of these meteors talks 
 yfprojects: Yeah, but these arent my talks :grinning:
 wlesavo: well you sure do look like you know smth about it :wink:
 yfprojects: probably as much as you, i havent heard about this meteor before jrke told us
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ccn.com/forget-coronavirus-this-earth-destroyer-asteroid-could-kill-you-first/">https://www.ccn.com/forget-coronavirus-this-earth-destroyer-asteroid-could-kill-you-first/</a>
 yfprojects: That's what jrke was talking about

 AntiSquid: it says "safely pass earth"
 wlesavo: lol, nice poll trump vs meteor
 struct: "It will miss by just 0.038 astronomical units."
 struct: These articles
 struct: That equals over 5 Million kilometers
 yfprojects: :confused:
 struct: 14 times the distance to the moon
 yfprojects: Its special, but not dangerous for us
 AntiSquid: i would be surprised if Biden doesn't win this time, he has dementia
 eulerscheZahl: i was hoping for bernie&#160;:(
 yfprojects: AntiSquid was has his dementia to do with him winning?
 wlesavo: i guess any one appart from biden would be actually interesting to watch
 wlesavo: yfprojects he means that americans like to vote for somebody with mental health problems lately
 yfprojects: I see
 yfprojects: but dont they prefer the leading one in this discipline?
 AntiSquid: hillary wasn't sane either, which is why the country is so divided
 AntiSquid: ever worked with dementia patients yfprojects&#160;? 
 yfprojects: My grandpa had it
 AntiSquid: had&#160;?
 AntiSquid: my condolences 
 wlesavo: yfprojects same
 Astrobytes: Mine has it. Not easy atm since he's on lockdown for 12 weeks
 yfprojects: thank you
 yfprojects: alone Astrobytes
 yfprojects:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Other than his carers 4 x a day, yep
 Astrobytes: I've been talking to him from the garden most days though
 AntiSquid: US doesn't have sane presidents, Obama sounded sane, he still went on to carpet bomb other countries
 Astrobytes: That *is* sanity for a lto of people, unfortunately.
 Astrobytes: *lot
 Neostis: hello bro

 yupo...: thanks
 DanTheMan832: why does no1 talkk in COC chat
 AntiSquid: ask in COC chat
 DanTheMan832: lul
 AntiSquid: why don't you play the contest instead?
 AntiSquid: i am sure you will learn a lot more from it than from playing COC
 eulerscheZahl: there are some bots in clash of code, when no real players want to join
 eulerscheZahl: and these bots never talk (nor publish their solutions after the clash)
 AntiSquid: do you iterate over all possible move combinations and pick the best? random search&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: me? no, stupid heuristics
 JFB: Small question about OoC Referee. Unfortunatelly I have very slow laptop - and use Python - so my bot is rather slow. I changed TurnMaxTime - and it give me more time in each turn. But I receive java.lang.RuntimeException: Total game duration too long (&gt;30000ms) error
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm totally not happy with it
 eulerscheZahl: JFB that's due to the codingame SDK
 JFB: I understund
 eulerscheZahl: there is a check that the bots don't exceed 30s/game (sum of all bots)
 eulerscheZahl: so, what's your question then?
 eulerscheZahl: how to get rid of it?
 JFB: I'm looking in API doc for change of this parametr 
 tensorflw: I'm new here with some python experience. Is there a way to look at other peoples solutions to learn that way?
 eulerscheZahl: reflection be an option. or modify the maven repo and don't import the official one
 AntiSquid: after you solved the puzzle you can go to history and there are solutions of others
 eulerscheZahl: tensorflw solve a puzzle first. then you have access to solutions in that language
 AntiSquid: but only for languages you solved
 tensorflw: great thanks
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - so it is no function similar to setTurnMaxTime? 
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK is meant for deploying games on the website, not for local testing
 JFB: OK. Thanx
 eulerscheZahl: i cursed about it multiple times too
 ZarthaxX: toad u meant stupid heuristics for your ooc bot?
 JFB: ZarthaxX - I think that eulerscheZahl think that each heuristic not giving him #1 is stupid&#160;;-)
 ZarthaxX: i was gonna say lol
 ZarthaxX: he hates his bot a lot
 eulerscheZahl: i do
 eulerscheZahl: nothing clever in it
 ZarthaxX: it got legend with heuristics, let it be
 ZarthaxX: it's a good boi
 DanTheMan832: what is heuristic?
 JFB: a lot of ifs&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: spaghetti amount
 wlesavo: my bot would definetly won the stupid heuristic competition
 ZarthaxX: lol
 JFB:&#160;:-) 
 Counterbalance: JFB if you want to patch the engine, look at engine/core/src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/core/GameManager.java around line 546, private void addTurnTime
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/engine/core/src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/core/GameManager.java#L575">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/engine/core/src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/core/GameManager.java#L575</a>
 JFB: Thank Counterbalance - I will look. Unfortunatelly I do not know Maven - so probably I have first to understund the way Maven works  :-)
 Counterbalance: you only have to install it, and then in the directory where you checked out the repo you run 'mvn install' - not too hard&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: wonder if my steadyclock is accurate, it shows 1 ms but i do a lot of calculations O_O
 JFB: I understund. But I only install repo with OoC - and Maven get all dependancies. So change in GameManager is very easy - but I'm not sure WHERE is GameManager.java really (probably not on my disk)
 Counterbalance: No, you'd have to 'git clone <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine.git&#39;">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine.git'</a>
 JFB: OK - but where is the place I inform Maven to use my clone - not CodinGame 
 JFB:&#160;?
 JFB: So I have to understund Maven to know how to inform it to use my clone
 Counterbalance: you do that by specifing a version number for the dependency in the referee.
 Counterbalance: if you 'mvn install' in the engine, it will build and copy the files to ~/.m2/repository/....
 JFB: So I can simply change in ~/.m2/repository&#160;?
 Counterbalance: Not exactly. Did you build the referee yourself using maven?
 JFB: Yes
 Counterbalance: ok, in the pom.xml in the referee, there's a dependency for the game engine
 Counterbalance: oh even better, near the top there's a &lt;gameengine.version&gt; tag.
 Counterbalance: 3.13.0. Change that to   master-SNAPSHOT
 Counterbalance: maven will then use that version from ~/.m2/repository
 JFB: OK - thanks - I will check&#160;:-)
 Counterbalance: you'll need to apply this patch to the CG game engine for it to build:

 blasterpoard: I guess the branching factor was a bit too high, that's why it was timing out
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Silence + silence :boom:
 JFB: Counterbalance - thank you - now I understund how it works  - my clone of gameengine write to ~/.m2 - and my clone of OoC read from ~/.m2&#160;:-) It is logical&#160;:-)
 Counterbalance: yup! 
 Zenoscave: so close to legend
 Zenoscave: I can taste it
 Illedan: Don't do it. Legend is just scary
 Zenoscave: but top 20...
 MadKnight: but scary...
 ZarthaxX: i think you are pretty far zeno
 MadKnight: yea fix it
 Zenoscave: true like 4 elo below
 ZarthaxX: darkhorse was below boss and now he is 26
 ZarthaxX: so... yeah lol
 Zenoscave: What's this I hear about a fight sim?
 darkhorse64: Trying to improve my bot ...
 tensorflw: Question for you guys. i'm doing the "Onboarding" challenge. Does the print statement "shoot" the enemies?
 ZarthaxX: darkhorse64 wasnt my point, just that being close to boss doesnt mean you are close
 tensorflw: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19834b69-ee6e-4d9f-9949-4ef048a8de0c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19834b69-ee6e-4d9f-9949-4ef048a8de0c</a>
 Zenoscave: yes tensorflw
 ZarthaxX: i know you are resubmitting 
 tensorflw: Is that the case for must games?
 tensorflw: most*
 Zenoscave: all
 tensorflw: Thanks!
 darkhorse64: Completely true. The gap is very large skillwise
 tensorflw: This is one of the coolest ways to polish coding skills. Amazing site. 
 ZarthaxX: it is
 AntiSquid: when gold MadKnight&#160;?
 MadKnight: :gold:
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why didn't they add this emoji&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think if you have a little bit
 AntiSquid: ya MadKnight you don't have any gold at all
 MadKnight: yea i only have the :legend:
 solistice: Hi all, I have a small question: I'm making a simulator for a Card Game, and I am now trying to decide if I should use 1 Game State and apply / undo each action, or copy the game state for different branches of the simulation
 solistice: I can't really find good information regarding this because I don't know what to search for
 solistice: Or is there maybe a third possibility that I'm forgetting?
 ZarthaxX: the undo thing
 ZarthaxX: may be possible or not
 ZarthaxX: depending on what actions do to a gamestate
 ZarthaxX: if they make you lose information completely it may be hard to do an undo
 solistice: I'm pretty sure I can do the undo, I could track the lost information I'm pretty sure, but I feel like, for minimax with a certain depth this would work, but if I go the routes of other methods, I don't think applying and undoing might be possible at all
 tobk: or both undo and occasionally copy. apply/undo in normal game, but make a copy before e.g. doing some monte-carlo-style random playouts for the AI player (if you have one), this way you do not have to undo the entire playout
 solistice: and I wanna make sure before I commit to one
 solistice: that actually makes a lot of sense, tobk
 solistice: it was MCTS indeed that I was thinking of,, undoing everything would be so slow
 solistice: I guess I'll have to deep copy each object tho, is there information online about best practices to do this? Maybe data structures to use instead of normal lists?
 JFB: Or allocate array of States one time. Nest copy your state to each State in the array (it can be fast). And after this do different changes in each State in the array. It is solution when undo is impossible or very expensive
 JFB: Counterbalance - than you one more time - your solution works and more important - I understund it and can now myself change what I want&#160;:-)
 Counterbalance: You're welcome, JFB!&#160;:)
 kovi: so random, but somehow now its top5 with yannt
 YannT: I made improvements yesterday&#160;:)
 YannT: it benched well locally but needed a lot of matches to make a difference
 YannT: siman clearly has the best bot I think right now... the chain pushing kinda makes him come down sometimes but other than that he's pretty dominant :p
 jft63: clearly yes Siman is the best at the moment&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: good news Illedan <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/languages-update/1574/142">https://forum.codingame.com/t/languages-update/1574/142</a>
 wlesavo: nice nagra
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: :dance:
 Illedan: :rocket:
 Illedan: \o/
 eulerscheZahl: oh, 23 in legend now
 eulerscheZahl: your boss failed wlesavo
 Illedan: Fix it!
 ZarthaxX: lol only 1 toad
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a shark now
 ZarthaxX: sharktoad
 smeagol: Hi
 smeagol: Mad: where's your AI&#160;?
 smeagol: Siman: please, I want you AI.
 MostComplicatedUsername: I've given up on the contest
 MostComplicatedUsername: I still have no way of tracking my opponent unless I accidentally hit them with my torpedo
 darkhorse64: Look at Illedan's stream, he gives some hints how to detect your opponent
 MostComplicatedUsername: On twitch? Or discord?
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/codingame">https://www.twitch.tv/codingame</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: Okay thx
 darkhorse64: Bear in mind it's just a beginning

 AntiSquid: and yes that's movie #6
 JFB: Is it real??? Really?
 kovi: azert nem vezet olyan siman
 AntiSquid: hogy vagy
 Astrobytes: Egészségedre!
 AntiSquid: i actually know those two words Astrobytes&#160;!
 Astrobytes: I know the one I posted too!
 Astrobytes: Also, Borz 
 AntiSquid: is that a polish word?
 AntiSquid: borsh&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, it's Hungarian for badger
 aangairbender: it's ukrainian food xD
 Nerchio: barszcz?
 AntiSquid: i know some swear words, but won't type them since i don't know the correct spelling :p
 AntiSquid: i guess it's that one Nerchio
 AntiSquid: tons of polish people in UK
 Counterbalance: "You can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn." - does this also apply for 2 different mines?
 Nerchio: to the same mine
 Counterbalance: thanks
 YannT: siman il me déglingue complétement
 YannT: wrong chan
 JasonTruter: Could I use Dijkstra for pathfinding?
 Nerchio: you can use anything you want really
 JasonTruter: What kind of graph is the map?
 JasonTruter: weighted or unweighted?
 pb4: JasonTruter&#160;: depends how you want to model it
 JasonTruter: I think it would be regarded as weighted since each nodes edges are the same
 JasonTruter: and not weighted
 Astrobytes: Well, your weights could be perceived threat levels, suspected enemy locations
 JasonTruter: Ah true
 JasonTruter: I guess that would be more advanced
 JasonTruter: Thanks for that information, really mind blowing&#160;:)
 JasonTruter: Currently learning BFS and unweighted graphs vs Dijkstra weighted
 JasonTruter: To try find shortest path to a node, atleast I can get some decent path finding
 JasonTruter: Hopefully this should get me to bronze
 Turch: Why can't we code in LISP? 
 Astrobytes: Cool JasonTruter, glad ya learning&#160;:) Pathfinding algos defo help on a lot of CG multis (and puzzles)
 FrankR: JasonTruter: you may also want to look at the FloydWarshall algorithm. Since the map is fixed, you can precompute all paths in advance
 AntiSquid: set up locally Turch
 Astrobytes: Turch, because it's not supported on the CG platform
 Turch: It was a cheap joke :slight_smile:
 Turch: Still learning the ropes of this - it's pretty fun!
 AntiSquid: but you can code in lisp if you download the game from the repo 
 Turch: Interesting
 AntiSquid: locally in any language 
 Nerchio: I swear next competition i am setting up locally if its possible
 AntiSquid: you can do it now
 Nerchio: its such a pain to test your build on site with small changes
 AntiSquid: there's a week left, most contests are 1 week anyway
 Nerchio: yea but i am top~70 gold and i am running out of ideas how to improve
 AntiSquid: and if you need help / advice to set up locally just ask
 AntiSquid: nice rank
 Turch: I'm surprised if nobody has exploited bugs yet
 Astrobytes: Those kind of bugs were fixed a few weeks ago Turch
 Turch: Ah, gotcha, guess it's a race between developers and players in a way
 Astrobytes: The devs are also playing&#160;;)
 kovi: pb4: at least wait out one submit round
 JasonTruter: How would I store all the nodes that were visited in the shortest path once I arrive at the destination node?
 pb4: Testing a new feature with huge coeff to see if it seems to work
 pb4: Now with a more sensible coefficient to see if it's good
 pb4: this one will finish normally&#160;:)
 kovi: you dont test locally?
 pb4: what do you call test locally&#160;?
 kovi: huge coeff to see if it does something
 pb4: yes
 Turch: For Coders Strike Back, do you BOOST for one frame, or can you hold it?
 MadKnight: u can't hold it
 Turch: Gotcha, thanks. Effect kept happening offscreen for me, so I wasn't certain.
 AntiSquid: you fight offscreen you die offscreen&#160;!
 kovi: pretty balanced
 AntiSquid: someone got pushed
 pb4: so pb4 &gt; kovi &gt; siman &gt; pb4&#160;?
 kovi: yeah
 kovi: and im still not good vs. joli and yannt
 pb4: I was good vs yannt
 pb4: Not anymore&#160;:(
 YannT: if you guys ever figure out what makes anyone good or not against someone else, let me know :p
 JasonTruter: Realized after everything it was probably better to work with a vector than a map
 JasonTruter: now I need to work with entries in the map for iteration
 JasonTruter: jeez :expressionless: lesson learnt
 YannT: told you :p
 JasonTruter: lol was learning&#160;:) But had to understand why
 pb4: beginner JasonTruter&#160;?
 JasonTruter: yes pb4
 AntiSquid: lol what's wrong with a map&#160;?
 Swagboy: I guess it's with spares positions you need to iter it for just a few cells
 Swagboy: But it's a trade-off
 Swagboy: ça grimpe doucement&#160;:|
 Astrobytes: Ce n'est pas anglais Swagboy, ban :P
 Swagboy: Haha maldito, lo siento
 Astrobytes: hahahaa
 alchemsti: Is there a pointer for running it locally? Agreed, it's super-painful trying to iterate on the page
 NormantasStankevicius: when you need a double sided Queue
 NormantasStankevicius: but C# queue is only one sided
 NormantasStankevicius: so you have to add a 900line file
 NormantasStankevicius: That supports queus
 NormantasStankevicius: wait, is that even allowed?
 Nerchio: can i see what was someone's last submit?
 Nerchio: when*
 Astrobytes: Nerchio hover your mouse over their score in the lb
 Nerchio: ty
 Astrobytes: np
 Nerchio: feels bad when some people didn't touch their bot for 6 days and i spent like 30 hours working on it
 Nerchio: and we are in the same spot :D
 Astrobytes: Welcome to CG contests :D
 Nerchio: but it's my first contest so i don't feel too bad
 Rd211: Normantas you can use a linkedlist if cache doesnt bother you
 Astrobytes: Top 100 gold first contest is pretty good, you still have a week so just keep at it&#160;;)
 Nerchio: yeah i have 2 ideas to implement
 Nerchio: scatter shot and poke shot
 Nerchio: poke is shoot and run so they can't retaliate and scatter shot is just pick better spots to shoot so i cover more possible spots enemy can be
 Astrobytes: Seems sensible
 NormantasStankevicius: Rd211 That is what was I thinking
 NormantasStankevicius: I reached Silver with relitevely simple path finding algorithm
 NormantasStankevicius: and people here were posting flood fill
 NormantasStankevicius: so I looked into it
 NormantasStankevicius: and my guide was basically saying use queues, but small amount of reasearch said it's similar to linked lists
 NormantasStankevicius: well, either way, it's 1am, and I will log off for now. Tomorrow I will implement queue and floodfill I was working on.
 Rd211: but you dont need deque for floodfill
 NormantasStankevicius: perhaps
 NormantasStankevicius: I sat down on my code for an hour
 NormantasStankevicius: refactoring a bit
 NormantasStankevicius: and working on floodfill
 NormantasStankevicius: It's easter and I am tired
 Astrobytes: It's just a queue, you'll see tomorrow when you're less tired&#160;;)
 NormantasStankevicius: I hope
 Astrobytes: get some rest&#160;:)
 NormantasStankevicius: I got to silver with a pathfinding algo, that doesn't go to 1block dead ends and a just walks up fully north, one block left, fully down and repeat
 NormantasStankevicius: and a bit of torpedoes
 Nerchio: see you tomorrow guys :D
 Astrobytes: gn Nerchio
 Astrobytes: NormantasStankevicius go and sleep, you'll be thankful for it tomorrow!
 Astrobytes: And keep a notepad by your bed in case you get any ideas
 NormantasStankevicius: I won't I will watch some anime
 NormantasStankevicius: Don't worry
 Astrobytes: Well, whatever relaxes you&#160;:)
 NormantasStankevicius: I have like 11things I can work on
 NormantasStankevicius: Better torpedoes, Improve Silence, add mine deployment, detect enemies from his torpedo shot, from my torpedo shot, implement radars, floodfilling, how to deal with silence (this one I have 0 idea), what is BFS and how it works? improved spawn, better pathfinding, not hit myself with torpedoes
 KANEKI: bro wtf
 KANEKI: just realized most ppl here are bots
 KANEKI: not real ppl
 KANEKI: in the clash of code game
 KANEKI: flash
 NormantasStankevicius: and how Nerchio said, I might add the shoot and run
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah
 NormantasStankevicius: Kaneki
 Scarfield: no bots here right, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i am not sure how much time are you using a search algo
 KANEKI: nah i just looked at the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: NormantasStankevicius  torpedo pathing is BFS, you can floodfill with BFS, this could help you pathfind
 KANEKI: and sorted by
 KANEKI: most clashes
 KANEKI: first 20 are all bots
 KANEKI: didnt bother to check rest
 KANEKI: 12**
 Astrobytes: KANEKI in clashes if there is no human opponent, the CG platform adds bots as opponents
 KANEKI: oh shit
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, because it would take too long to find a fight
 AntiSquid: KANEKI clashes don't do much, just play the contest instead
 Astrobytes: That's why they played the most clashes
 NormantasStankevicius: but aren't the bots coded by other people? just CG gives the API and allows them?
 AntiSquid: also at least playing the contest you have some topic in common with the others in chat
 Astrobytes: Not the clash bots no
 KANEKI: no wonder they didnt respond
 KANEKI: when i called them out
 KANEKI: for having so many clashes played
 KANEKI: i was wondering how it was even posisble
 AntiSquid: give it few years and they will respond after a new upgrade
 KANEKI: lol
 NormantasStankevicius: I feel clash just improved how fast you can bash out a simple function
 Astrobytes: KANEKI I think there's an article about it on the CG blog somewhere
 NormantasStankevicius: but for competitive programming
 NormantasStankevicius: it doesn't cut
 KANEKI: now that i know they're bots
 KANEKI: im not addicted anymore
 KANEKI: wont be*
 AntiSquid: i don't fancy clashes at all, if i wanna take 30 minutes to contemplate on how to create a simple array then i don't want an annoying timer to tell me i am too slow
 KANEKI: are u from the UK
 KANEKI: nvm u are
 AntiSquid: why?! @_@
 Astrobytes: KANEKI puzzles, contests and the multis are where it's at imo
 KANEKI: because no one says "fancy"
 KANEKI: besides people uk ppl
 AntiSquid: oh
 AntiSquid: that's discrimination
 Astrobytes: lol :DThat's on point
 KANEKI: whats multis
 Astrobytes: 'fancy' in that context at least
 AntiSquid: quite sure some american tourists say "fancy"
 KANEKI: nah thats in diff context
 Ifthel: Fancy that
 KANEKI: acc most ppl ik dont use that word
 KANEKI: ^ thats uk usage
 Astrobytes: Bot programming and optimization games KANEKI, usually past contests
 KANEKI: "i dont fancy that"
 NormantasStankevicius: Also
 AntiSquid: uk suburb jargon 
 KANEKI: most ppl say 
 NormantasStankevicius: How is the University of Wroclaw so high?
 KANEKI: i dont find that fancy
 Ifthel: I've never heard anyone say that
 KANEKI: yea cos no one really says fancy
 AntiSquid: they have strong competitors / more participants? i have no idea how that rank is calculated NormantasStankevicius
 KANEKI: i havent heard that word in a million years
 AntiSquid: wow
 Ifthel: I'm making it my mission to use fancy as often as possible now
 AntiSquid: how was the world a million years ago?
 Astrobytes: They live among us AntiSquid
 KANEKI: There was no AntiSquid
 KANEKI: So life was good
 AntiSquid: any squids walking on land?
 KANEKI:&#160;:))
 KANEKI: Yeah, they used to climb trees.
 KANEKI: Have families
 KANEKI: My best friend then was a squid
 KANEKI: anwyays i have a exam thats worth 50% of my final grade tmrw
 KANEKI: pce
 AntiSquid: funny because i watched some documentary that tried to predict what wild life might evolve into, and it included squids on land and climbing trees
 KANEKI: and a big project thats also due (worth 22%)
 KANEKI: lmaoo
 KANEKI: anwyays pce
 AntiSquid: isn't school closed?
 Astrobytes: Well good luck KANEKI
 KANEKI: Online Exam
 KANEKI: Everything is online
 AntiSquid: why waste time on clash when you have exam?
 KANEKI: lol
 AntiSquid: don't you value your time?
 KANEKI: just a couple of games
 KANEKI: nw, i got google
 KANEKI: during the exam
 KANEKI: as its online
 KANEKI: bye
 Astrobytes: Then you will gain nothing from your exam
 AntiSquid: do they actually teach anything school&#160;? saying you will use google to pass the exam sounds like the exam actually requires you to study first
 AntiSquid: school should focus more on preparing people for life imo&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Learning is still important but yes, it should
 AntiSquid: of course, learning would be involved
 Astrobytes: How are you supposed to apply your 'skills' in the real world with next-to-no knowledge of it?
 Astrobytes: Massively overlooked issue
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: it's like you're completely detached from the real world
 Astrobytes: Agreed. Same in most uni's too
 AntiSquid: what are universities bad too?
 Astrobytes: In terms of the detachment thing
 AntiSquid: oh right
 AntiSquid: for a moment i forgot
 AntiSquid: people study there for years and apparently they still need to build up work experience once they're done
 Astrobytes: Yes. But can't because they mostly have no experience.
 Zenoscave: Any legend OOC players on chat?
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 is a legend, he told us
 Astrobytes: "seeking graduate C# dev with 15+ years of FORTRAN experience"
 Automaton2000: that doesn't mean that i can learn how to use boost
 Zenoscave: whoa
 Zenoscave: you got to legend w/o boost huh
 AntiSquid: aren't the agencies to blame for those kind of job adverts Astrobytes&#160;? :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah mostly AntiSquid :D
 AntiSquid: i find the recruitment agencies are filled with terribly stupid and clueless people
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave u are alone
 Zenoscave: nuuuuuu
 ZarthaxX: legend gates wont let u get it
 Zenoscave: wep wep
 ZarthaxX: im sorry
 ZarthaxX: pew pew
 Astrobytes: Oftentimes the HR dept of the companies are also totally misinterpreting the lead's requests too :D
 Zenoscave: pew pew ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: mah man zeno
 Astrobytes: TardaxX!
 ZarthaxX: working hard on that legend
 ZarthaxX: Tastro (=?
 ZarthaxX: did corona abandon your body already?
 Astrobytes: AstroTard
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: i forgot
 Astrobytes: Actually just getting better now
 ZarthaxX: thanks for the reminder
 ZarthaxX: noice
 ZarthaxX: and your mom?
 AntiSquid: some hospital staff died, they weren't wearing masks&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: All good here for now, just need to build strength up again
 Astrobytes: All good with you ZarthaxX?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid the PPE situation is ridiculous
 AntiSquid: is your polar bear fat still at the healthy ratio ZarthaxX&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: ye im gud but uni is being savage with ppl 
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid i think so
 ZarthaxX: lockdown didnt affect my health :P
 Astrobytes: In terms of distancing ZarthaxX? Or are they just shooting everyone who coughs? :P
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: no
 ZarthaxX: uni will start tomorrow
 ZarthaxX: but they limited the amount of ppl for each subject
 ZarthaxX: so they did a random shufle with python they even showedthe code lol
 ZarthaxX: and they took out a lot of ppl 
 Astrobytes: You're still gonna physically be in classrooms?
 ZarthaxX: and there are cases where those ppl got taken out of all their submjects
 Astrobytes: Why not online?
 ZarthaxX: subjects
 Ifthel: They showed the code? Any possibility to change your last name?
 Astrobytes: Wow, that doesn't see mright
 ZarthaxX: so they will lose the csemester
 Astrobytes: *seem right
 ZarthaxX: so that's the problem
 ZarthaxX: we are gonna have virtual classes
 Astrobytes: That's fucking crazy
 ZarthaxX: but for some reason they limited the # of ppl
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX i wanted to show you a video i saw the other day, but can't find it
 AntiSquid: so i show you this one instead:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/PLkX0Cx_bpw?t=142">https://youtu.be/PLkX0Cx_bpw?t=142</a>
 AntiSquid: it's about polar bear x grizzly hybrid
 ZarthaxX: content
 AntiSquid: i mean seriously interesting, polar bears and grizzlies get along alright
 ZarthaxX: okey..
 AntiSquid: and the hybrids seem slightly smarter than their parents
 Uljahn: fancy bears
 AntiSquid: is your gf as savage as a grizzly ZarthaxX?
 Astrobytes: "When he caught up to the bear, he shot and killed it"&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: ya, lame
 AntiSquid: the other video i saw didn't have any bear killings in it, just hybrids
 AntiSquid: something about possible contribution of hybrids to evolution
 ZarthaxX: depends squido
 ZarthaxX: not with me lol but with others she is .D
 Astrobytes: not gonna watch the whole thing but I presume the interbreeding is due to polar bears migrating in search of better living conditions due to climate change
 AntiSquid: see ZarthaxX? you'll get smart kids then, she's a keeper
 AntiSquid: yes Astrobytes
 ZarthaxX: lol i hope
 ZarthaxX: we are dumpin the dumb ones
 AntiSquid: but the initial video i watched was more about evolution than forced migration 
 Astrobytes: Forced migration impacts on evolution
 AntiSquid: hm it does
 AntiSquid: there was a coyote x wolf hybrid bit too
 AntiSquid: supposedly they're smarter and eat about anything
 Astrobytes: We're still discovering these hybrids
 Astrobytes: And they're still appearing
 AntiSquid: not if some nutjobs shoot them first
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed
 Astrobytes: Shoot me a link if you find the original vid AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: sure
 Astrobytes: I'm out for tonight, see ya's tomorrow
 AntiSquid: gn8
 ZarthaxX: cya astro!
 Zenoscave: nn
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/448810006">https://www.codingame.com/replay/448810006</a> my bot is finally learning to fight... hidden version wins most games under 100 turns (but only because they always spawn close to each other and then fight)
 Zenoscave: nice blasterpoard
 Zenoscave: do you only sim fights if you know their location?
 blasterpoard: Zenoscave if there are &lt;25 locations possible
 Zenoscave: that's cool
 Zenoscave: MCTS or MM?
 Zenoscave: I'd love to read a PM after the contest
 PortalBot: learning to fight? what do you use? :p
 Zenoscave: nothing yet
 Scarfield: nice action combo for the win :muscle:
 blasterpoard: oof... neither MCTS nor MM
 Zenoscave: I have no sim yet
 PortalBot: neural network?
 Zenoscave: Might do plain MC the next couple days
 blasterpoard: PortalBot no, just fixed depth and pruning
 ZarthaxX: so u treat separately fighting and moving blaster? damn
 Zenoscave: I suspect many top bots do by now
 ZarthaxX: dont get how u sim a fight with many possible spots
 blasterpoard: ZarthaxX actually you don't need to sim that much
 blasterpoard: you can prune most options at depth 1 as inferior
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: but you are fighting against every possible spot?
 blasterpoard: yes
 ZarthaxX: ah just to manage probabilities
 ZarthaxX: of whats best overall
 Famout: HA! OK, amused, somehow I got raised a rank in Ocean of code by doing nothing. 
 Famout: Was in wood 1 after submitting, rank 50. Now in Bronze at rank 36. 
 Phil-Reck: That's great Famount
 Famout: I don't even shoot, I just pathfind. 
 Famout: Guess I should shoot though and see if I can't reach gold. 
 Neon_Tuts: &lt;Hello World /&gt;

 Jankovahoe: im a girl
 procoder1: no + ratio
 Uljahn: kicked, next time is ban
 procoder1: who wants to code with me
 waterproofsodium: you find people to code with in clash
 waterproofsodium: "clash of code"
 5DN1L: waterproofsodium, nice to have a profile pic, it makes you less newbie-like
 waterproofsodium: ty :D
 5DN1L: :D
 waterproofsodium: I'm a overlord from starcraft&#160;;)
 5DN1L: btw i just saw your other message - i had to translate it to understand it haha
 waterproofsodium: hahaha be careful usually humor gets lost from anything translated from or to german

 Boju66: anyone got tips for getting out of bronze mad pod racing?
 waterproofsodium: pod racing there's a formula
 Uljahn: ye, just drift better
 waterproofsodium: that brings you pretty far
 procoder1: Hallo, sprecht ihr alle deutsch
 Boju66: ive done the go slower round corners bit
 5DN1L: English only please, procoder1
 procoder1: me no english 
 5DN1L: or get kicked out
 waterproofsodium: it was like: have a coefficient for your velocity, that is negative and add that vector to your next target
 procoder1: i use google translate for english
 Boju66: okay thanks
 waterproofsodium: find the coefficient that works best for yourself, but I think it was like 2 approximately
 Boju66: ill try&#160;;)
 Boju66: what are these emojis lmao
 procoder1: me clash of code
 waterproofsodium: unit of velocity = 2 units/"tick"
 ...bored: eyo can anyone help me with sorting algorithms in python (im a beginner (its just about sorting a number of variabels that are not stored inside of an array))
 waterproofsodium: * unit of velocity = units/"tick"
 therapist_with_a_space: ‚ïë
 procoder1: :eye::tongue::eye:
 Boju66: do i need to make that a variable im guessing
 Boju66: tysm
 5DN1L: kicked, next is a ban, procoder1

 5DN1L: you want to be kicked too? therapist_with_a_space
 Uljahn: Boju66: ye, add them to list
 therapist_with_a_space: no
 5DN1L: then no spam please
 waterproofsodium: gotta move out. have a good day everyone
 therapist_with_a_space: ok
 Boju66: thanks Uljahn
 Uljahn: also if you need more specific help, you have to provide an example of such variables
 Uljahn: oops, i was answering to ...bored
 ...bored: ah sry gotcha ... im working on the "the desent" rn in wich gives you 8 variables at the beginning of each game ... the task is to sort these variables in descending order
 Uljahn: the task is to find the index of the maximum number
 ...bored: yeah every roun
 Uljahn: you can store (value, index) pairs in a list, then sort it or use max() function and output the second part
 Uljahn: or find max value and then use value_list.index(max_value)
 ...bored: ah ok ill try that thx

 MSmits: hi
 struct: hi
 struct: is site slow for anyone else?
 MSmits: not sure, it is slow but i am in the train. Train wifi is horrible
 therealbeef: *dutch train wifi
 MSmits: do you live in a country with good train wifi?
 struct: We dont use the trains here
 struct: Netherlands is different
 MSmits: Because they are not safe?
 struct: no, because cities are not built for them
 therealbeef: Korea has good train/bus wifi
 MSmits: weird, you just need a train track
 MSmits: ah ok
 zakacat: and billions of dollars of infrastructure that is a hard sell for politicians
 MSmits: there's benefit as well
 MSmits: financial
 zakacat: I agree
 MSmits: travel costs go down for a lot of people
 zakacat: Just saying why it is not an easy decision
 MSmits: if you travel alone, cars are insanely expensive to use
 MSmits: that's true for any political decision almost. 
 therealbeef: dutch trains are insanely expensive too :D
 zakacat: we don't have very good public transit in Canada. The big cities have trains, and the city busses are decent, but pretty much all intercity travel is personal vehicle or plane
 struct: When I went to Amsterdam it was clear it's a city not built for cars
 MSmits: well that's not the kind of train i am talking about
 MSmits: you are talking about trams
 MSmits: I am taking about large trains that move between cities
 MSmits: most cities dont have trams... just busses
 zakacat: Ah, I think they decided a long time ago that it is far more worth it to use our rail for cargo which drives up the cost of tickets for personell
 MSmits: that just means you need more trains
 MSmits: there is no reason to make those two compete
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://maps-portugal.com/img/0/portugal-rail-map.jpg">https://maps-portugal.com/img/0/portugal-rail-map.jpg</a>
 zakacat: I dunno then. Possibly corruption in the rail lines then
 struct: as you can see its not great
 struct: Porto and lisbon are the exception
 MSmits: scale matters though
 zakacat: Id love to go to Portugal
 zakacat: one day
 MSmits: seems like a reasonable rail map imho
 MSmits: we also have towns that have no trains going to them
 MSmits: you need busses for those
 MSmits: big cities all have train stations though
 MSmits: some multiple
 struct: I think culture is also a large factor
 MSmits: yeah i was gonna say thar
 MSmits: people get used to cars
 MSmits: they dont know any better
 MSmits: we have a lot of bicycles too
 struct: as soon as I left the train station I saw like 1k bikes
 struct: in netherlands
 MSmits: In Amsterdam?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: yes, they are everywhere
 MSmits: some things you see in Amsterdam are specific to that city, some things arent
 MSmits: Amsterdam does not give you a good impression of the Netherlands as a whole though
 MSmits: cars are fine to use in most cities for example
 struct: yeah its for tourists I guess
 MSmits: yeah thats one difference
 MSmits: but it's also a major student and culture city
 MSmits: If you want to see "normal" Netherlands, go to Zaandam, or Almere or something
 MSmits: not as exciting probably
 struct: In portugal its the same
 therealbeef: Almere is kinda bottom of the barrel XD
 struct: Many cities will give you the wrong impression 
 MSmits: hey dont sht on Almere&#160;:) I lived there half my life
 kovi: hello MSmits
 MSmits: hi kovi
 kovi: will you play the new locm?
 zakacat: Give :taco: kovi
 MSmits: at some point probably
 MSmits: but I am doing yavalath/oware/great escape atm
 struct: The cities are completely different from ehre
 struct: here*
 struct: At least from the images im seeing
 struct: They seem more organized 
 MSmits: they are very organized yes
 MSmits: people experience it as boring/lack of atmosphere though
 therealbeef: The old dutch mid-sized cities are nice. Alkmaar, Leiden, Den Bosch, Utrecht, Groningen
 MSmits: I kinda like the organized cities
 MSmits: when i had to deliver newspapers it made it pretty easy
 wlesavo: oh MSmits, you going to do GE? great time to check my playground :smiley:
 MSmits: oh ok, i will
 MSmits: can you link it?

 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I will stop pinging then
 MSmits: havent seen trolls this bad befor
 MSmits: wlesavo you still around?
 wlesavo: yeah
 MSmits: ok, i assume you are familiar with mcts solver?
 wlesavo: somewhat yes =)
 Reyil: hi
 Reyil: :wave:
 MSmits: ok, imagine a really good gamestate in which you basically can't lose
 Reyil: MSmits, hi
 MSmits: all nodes to select have value 1,0 which means 100% WR
 MSmits: hi Reyil
 MSmits: whats going to happen on selection?
 wlesavo: random
 MSmits: well random, or all get equal numbers of visits right?
 MSmits: is this a good thing when you want to prove the win?
 wlesavo: not really
 MSmits: no, you want to select just the 1 node
 MSmits: any of them really, since they are all winning

 DomiKo: damn
 MSmits: so instead of UCT-normal, you remove the part that depends on visit count and just go by the value + 61 - the number of children of that node, so you pick the winning node with the smallest amount of branching
 struct: ...
 MSmits: extreme improvement of solving speed for winning states
 MSmits: I think i can speed up my c4 solver this way also
 wlesavo: oh i see
 MSmits: it works for any game that ends with 100% winning nodes for the last few levels
 MSmits: (depth levels)

 MSmits: example, check when my bot solves and when jace k's does
 MSmits: (his bot says -10 when it solves)
 sussycoder: hey everyone im new!
 struct: but how do you know that the node is pretty much solved?
 Capybarapullup: same
 Reyil: hi sussycoder
 sussycoder: Hey Reyil!
 MSmits: you dont have to know if it is pretty much solved
 Reyil: how are you
 MSmits: you just have to have a near 100% WR (I use 95% or 97.5%)
 struct: No I mean to know when to use the other UCT
 sussycoder: Hey Reyil!
 MSmits: i use value cutoff 0.9 or 0.95
 sussycoder: oops 
 struct: do you check the parent?
 MSmits: so i first calculate the value and then I calculate the rest of UCT
 MSmits: no i just check each child
 struct: ah
 struct: so if each child score &gt;= 0.9
 MSmits: not each
 MSmits: just 1
 MSmits: or more
 wlesavo: i should try that someday

 Capybarapullup: Okay, I pull up (Okay, I pull up), hop out at the after party
 MSmits: any child above the cutoff is preferred to all others
 struct: So lets say I entered normal select
 MSmits: and the child in that group with the smallest amount of children of its own is preferred also
 struct: What happens?
 MSmits: you always enter normal select, it's just a different UCT formula for some children
 struct: Currently I check each child and select best UCB
 MSmits: you do the same, it's just a different formula for some children
 MSmits: the ones that have value &gt; 0.95
 struct: ah ok
 MSmits: so as soon as one gets that, it gets 100% focused on
 struct: I can try that
 MSmits: until it drops below the cutoff
 struct: seems short
 MSmits: it's very easy to code
 MSmits: the new formula is value + SOME_NUMBER - child count
 Reyil: hi MSmits
 MSmits: you assume the child has been expanded so you know how many children it has
 MSmits: some number is 61 for me for yavalath
 MSmits: so that the value always has a positive number added
 MSmits: you could make it 100 also, doesnt matter
 struct: but wont it be higher than 1 then?
 MSmits: yeah, this doesnt matter
 MSmits: it's just a uct result
 wlesavo: thx for sharing MSmits, quite interesting
 MSmits: it's often higher than 1 btw
 MSmits: uct = value + exploration term
 MSmits: i replace the exploration with the 61- childcount term
 struct: my uct is never higher than 1
 struct: or is it?
 struct: idk
 MSmits: your value is never higher than 1
 macyqs_sister: hello!
 MSmits: but your UCT is
 MSmits: you add the sqrtlog thingy
 struct: I see
 macyqs_sister: hi struct! thats a cool name!
 MSmits: It's especially useful in late game yavalath because you can just count the number of loss hexes (from 3 in a row) and know one player has too few safe hexes. So you get a lot of 100% WR nodes
 MSmits: it's like that for the last 20 plies or so
 MSmits: a normal MCTS is going to explore all those 100% WR nodes equally, which slows things down *a lot*
 flizin: suck my d struct
 MSmits: you just need 1 of those, preferably the one that forces moves
 MSmits: (small branching)
 struct: Thanks for explaining
 struct: Makes sense
 Reyil: :nauseated_face:
 MSmits: np
 Reyil: MSmits
 MSmits: yes?
 Reyil: hi
 MSmits: hi
 struct: stop spamming Reyil
 Reyil: :wave:
 Reyil: i'm not
 jacek: so if child has 0.95 you assume its win?
 struct: no jacek
 struct: He just changes UCB to visit it more
 MSmits: To *only* visit it
 MSmits: I don't visit anything else unless it gets solved as a loss or draw, or if it drops below 0.95
 MSmits: if it turns out it isn't a win, it should be no problem, the rollouts should be able to show this
 jacek: is this some progressive pruning or widening?
 jacek: it feels so nostalgic, from the time where random-based mcts was a thing
 MSmits: this can be used by a NN
 MSmits: it's not specific to random rollouts
 MSmits: you can have a NN use a cutoff where it is very likely to win and then stop exploring other nodes as well
 struct: it might even be better
 struct: since you can lower the value
 struct: instead of being 0.95
 MSmits: well i am not sure that is a good idea
 MSmits: nn eval isnt perfect either
 struct: Well I trust jacek NN more than my mcts random rollout
 jacek: oh im 4th in oware :rage:
 MSmits: but do you trust NN's eval more than 1000 random rollouts near the end of the game?
 MSmits: 1000 vs 1
 struct: I see what you mean
 MSmits: yavalath random rollouts are extremely strong near the end because of how the game works. There are no traps and such,
 MSmits: it's just filling up hexes
 MSmits: connect 4 is a bit similar to that
 MSmits: hmm I am not seeing much improvement using this in c4.
 MSmits: but it doesn't work on draws, so it could be that
 struct: so its perfect for bt?
 MSmits: mmh doubtful, bt needs ept right?
 MSmits: random rollouts are weak
 MSmits: but a meta mcts for bt, maybe
 jacek: bt is quite trappy
 MSmits: yavalath too, but you can fix this in a large part with smart random rollout
 MSmits: not sure if this works in bt
 MSmits: oh and bt is probably trappy all the way through the game, yavalath mostly early
 struct: yeah for bt it wont work for my eval
 Wizard-Dude: Hello, I have been seeing that in mad pod racer, people change their place they want to move based on there angle to the checkpoint, how do they do it?  
 MSmits: I think it might work better for my c4 solver program. I got stuck on 11x4 because of that same "full 100% WR" selection thing where it would just explore everything unless i solved by hand
 MSmits: (which meant choosing 1 node to go through)
 jacek: if i remember correctly it was about choosing thrust depending on  angle &lt; -90 || angle &gt; 90
 jacek: as for changing place, there is trick of target checkpoint - 3 * pod velocity
 MSmits: oh noes... -3vel
 MSmits: make it seem more mathematical by putting -3pi
 MSmits: -pi*vel sry
 jacek: math? :scream:
 Wizard-Dude: @jacek so what do you mean target checkpoint, are you meaning the checkpoints x or y&#160;?
 MSmits: both
 MSmits: it's vector subtraction
 MSmits: x-3vx and y -3vy
 Wizard-Dude: thanks! 
 jacek: you need to calcuate velocity yourself
 MSmits: the problem with this trick though, is that it works so well, you wont be able to improve much after that unless you learn how to do a search
 MSmits: and you should probably not learn how to do a search in that game, it's not an easy game to start with this
 Wizard-Dude: another question, for calculating velocity would I just take the position from last turn and find the difference between the position this turn? 
 MSmits: yes
 struct: yes
 jacek: eeyup
 Wizard-Dude: thanks!
 MSmits: if it doesnt work, you have a bug. You should get into gold easily
 Scarfield: pod racers hate this one trick
 MSmits: you make it sounds like a typical click-bait article title
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ujeb.se/cmp8su">https://ujeb.se/cmp8su</a>
 Wizard-Dude: Could someone help me with my bug, for some reason I am going to 41242, 24428 which is outside of the map. I am outputting (nextcheckpointx - (3 * vx) , nextcheckpointy - (3 * vy), thrust) and I am calculating vx and vy by getting the difference between my last and current position, what am I doing wrong?  
 jacek: show your code
 Wizard-Dude: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da1a4819-abab-42ed-963a-276211b686df">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da1a4819-abab-42ed-963a-276211b686df</a>
 jacek: hmm you set the vx vy before the Scan
 jacek: do the if block after fmt.Scan(&amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;ncx, &amp;ncy, &amp;ncd, &amp;nca)
 Wizard-Dude: In this league they do not give vx and vy, I had to create them
 struct: yes but you are using x before reading it
 Wizard-Dude: oh thanks!
 jacek: it plays better/
 Wizard-Dude: Yes a lot. I appreciate the help!  :grinning:
 jacek: :tada:

 aCat: the other... 
 aCat: seems like you are using PICK  command and expect it to behave like a CHOOSE command
 aCat: but we will do some significant change here as it seems to cause problems
 aCat: so choose will be deprecated
 aCat: and cards will be sorted based on ids - so PICK will behave like both these commands&#160;;]
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't go by the viewer, I error_logged the playerMana
 aCat: therwe will be two indexes for a card
 aCat: 1 is its number and it will be equal to a position in draft
 aCat: the other instance in game
 aCat: hmm, no idea then with the mana
 aCat: Also - why you are mentioning cardlist and those 160  old cards?
 aCat: they are not existing now at all
 aCat: you only have these 120 that are generated and they have no connection to the cards in LOCM 1.0&amp;1.2

 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, ok....you had so many card generator algorithms.&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok i used pick instead of chosen
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was using IDs not nb
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, that's my bad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It wasn't confusing, I just completely missed it
 aCat: ok, so what is wrong with this repla?
 aCat: double turn 3 mana?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the mana displayed looks right because it's incremented and displayed at beginning of opponent turn...but the input I'm given at beginning of my turn is ofc incorrect... it's gotta be the semi-global reference and not an instance reference to bonusmana
 PatrickMcGinnisII: changing to choose and see what it does, smh...wow i suck at reading the rules i guess
 aCat: so you are given incorrect mana values?
 aCat: in display it is ok because there are multimove turns
 aCat: oh
 aCat: opponent has double 3 because of his mana bonus
 aCat: 'The second player receives his +1 max mana bonus until he spends all his mana during a turn.'
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh it does like frame anims, but yes the mana given to me in the first line of input as player 0 mimics what is happenning when player 1 uses all their mana
 aCat: so he got 2 plus 1 bonus, and if he spends &lt;3 then next turn he has 3 plus 1 bonus
 aCat: spends 2
 aCat: if he spends all 3 then next turn he has 'normal' 3 and no bonus anymore
 aCat: is it clear now?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when player 1 triggers the bonusmana negating effect, it happens to player 0 too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: because bonusmana isn't this.bonusmana
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not looking at code at this moment
 PatrickMcGinnisII: changing from PICK to CHOOSE solved my deck problems, sry about that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no wonder i couldn't find bug in code for that one
 aCat: but adding this won't change anything in code
 aCat: aaa you mean id
 PatrickMcGinnisII: frame 11 and frame 16 of the replay show the standard error stream of the mana data given...3 repeats ... as player 0, which it shouldn't

 aCat: I'm not you - I can;t see your standard error ;p
 aCat: you have to give me your password to cg profile :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i thought the replay...has the 3 dots...
 aCat:  can only see output and params
 aCat: buit ok, i got the idea
 aCat: well work on it - promise!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: When player 1 instance is created, it changes the bonusmana for all Gamers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's all i was trying to say
 aCat: I think I see this, but have to check
 aCat: thanks a lot
 aCat: cat sleep bb
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don;'t know how that effects starting mana, i think they are both set to -1 ... so yea it'll probably need to be different, GL
 DABAMA: is there a way to only get into shortest code
 DABAMA: in clash of code
 Ayza: unless you make a private clash, no
 Darleanow: hey Ayza
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 44AA44: DABAMA If you wanna make a private clash together so we can do shortest mode, I'm down!
 Ayza: hey Darlean
 Darleanow: hwy&#160;?:)
 Darleanow: i'm still stuck on ur freakin 1D bush fire&#160;:////
 Ayza: lol, try doing other puzzles if your stuck
 Ayza: for the 1D bush fire one I didn't split the string I just used indexes because yknow the f stops fire on the one before it + the one after it
 Ayza: hope that was a good hint
 Darleanow: not sure but i think i get it&#160;:)
 Ayza: aw passed all testcases but failed validators 5 and 6 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sticky-keyboard">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sticky-keyboard</a>
 mjoshu4: Any one can help to enhance my php coding skills&#160;?&#160;:&lt;
 Ayza: I am confused now, pretty sure I did all the statement does
 Ayza: said *
 Ayza: nvm, had to change one line and got 100%
 Ayza: stupid mistake

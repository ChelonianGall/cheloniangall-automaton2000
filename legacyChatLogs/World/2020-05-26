 struct: What search are you using?
 struct: daffie
 eulerscheZahl: in the first turn you can set any direction you want. only for later turns it's your current angle +- 18Â°
 aldrinm: is there a way to pause the game while i'm in the console output window maximised&#160;? I have to always restore it to be able to access the pause button. sometimes i like to stay in the console output maximised
 daffie: thanks that's what I wanted to know
 aimadjaouhar: hi guys  ! hope you're doing great
 aimadjaouhar: I am about to implement mutual friends feature (show and count friends of my friends).. What is the best approach for an app of 50k ~ 100K users!  Can anyone help me with some resources
 daffie: like facebook?
 aimadjaouhar: yes
 daffie: maybe facebook would be a good resource I think theirs is available
 aimadjaouhar: do you mean Graph API&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: anyone know C# here?
 WINWINWIN: Can you tell me what the equivalent of valueOf() from Java is in C#?
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl do you know how to get the enum type from an integer?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: we just don't know
 Automaton2000: need to be in the top 20
 darkhorse64: $Hama$h13!
 darkhorse64: oops&#160;! Cat
 Uljahn: leet speaking cat, nice
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:( I need to finish a C# write for my FB GA
 WINWINWIN: translated it to Java but not even crossing 200 sims
 WINWINWIN: Code is so bloated and messy&#160;:(
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN that's why I'm doing the games easier to simulate first
 cegprakash: Fantastic Bits is not easy to simulate
 cegprakash: do search race WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: that's what I also plan to stream this weekend
 jrke: hey reCurse and all top legend in CSB can u tell me how u predict enemy location
 WINWINWIN: jrke they use smitsimax
 jrke: means
 WINWINWIN: minimax variant developed by MSmits
 jrke: K
 darkhorse64: It's not a minimax variant, rather an MCTS one
 darkhorse64: Some use smitsimax but the best use a Neural Network coupled with an MCTS
 WINWINWIN: How many people actually use NNs?
 darkhorse64: Maybe 3
 WINWINWIN: agade, pb4 &amp; reCurse?
 darkhorse64: + fenrir
 CyberLemonade: what's the smitsimax darkhorse64
 cegprakash: ban elmendator plz
 cegprakash: inviting me to clash
 Jasperr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax</a>
 CyberLemonade: thanks Jasperr
 cegprakash: minimax + mcts = smitsimax?
 CyberLemonade: also, how to combine an NN with MCTS?
 mohammadhei05: hello
 WINWINWIN: Hey!!
 mohammadhei05: :muscle:
 mohammadhei05: :yum:
 darkhorse64: cegprakash: No
 darkhorse64: CyberLemonade: you use the result of the NN instead of a rollout
 CyberLemonade: I mean what exactly is the NN trained on? predicting the result of a game?
 darkhorse64: Moving the pods
 darkhorse64: with an evaluation
 CyberLemonade: I think I understand
 CyberLemonade: thankss
 darkhorse64: Never done that. So I am not 100% sure
 cegprakash: NN bots should be running in O(1) right?
 cegprakash: or do they use the 50 ms?
 cegprakash: when I hear NN I imagine offline training
 CyberLemonade: yepp
 CyberLemonade: me too
 cegprakash: and just using a magic formula with 10 parameters
 mohammadhei05: heleooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 SantiSalinas: uys what kind of framework do you recommend to start developing business applications with java? I had thought spring but I don't know
 daffie: mine is just using the 50 ms
 cegprakash: have anyone tried CSB with minimax and alpha beta pruning?
 daffie: there's 1000ms at the start to simulate then number of games for each round
 cegprakash: daffie I'm talking about NN
 cegprakash: NN shouldn't use 50 ms in my opinion
 cegprakash: it should just run in like 1ms 
 daffie: not 50ms
 daffie: I thought you didn't mean it literally
 daffie: not sure what you mean about 1ms, more simulations the better if you have 75ms why wouldn't you use the full 75ms
 Magus: that's depend of how you use your NN
 Magus: if i remember well, the Alpha Go Zero AI is a MCTS using a NN (for exploration and rollouts)
 Alshock: Idk about Zero, but that's what Alpha go first of the name did (two NNs thus)
 FarooqKZ: Why do people hate Common Lisp?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: that's lispsism
 Automaton2000: well you need to keep track of the enemy
 Uljahn: ceg: you definitely forgot about 100k limit, also MAB and MCTS can both use UCB1 but tree search just converges faster i guess
 WINWINWIN: Given an enum and an integer how can you find which element in that enum corresponds to that integer?
 WINWINWIN: in C#?
 WINWINWIN: I know that in Java the .valueOf() method can be used/
 WINWINWIN: Hardcoded it
 EvgenieTivaniuk: Yay! I finally managed to get higher from wood league!
 ArianPunk: any C programmer here?
 abt8601: Well I know a little bit of C
 Alshock: @WINWINWIN (MyEnum)myIntVal doesn't work in C#&#160;?
 ArianPunk: abt8601 still here?
 WINWINWIN: Did not try that yet Alshock
 Alshock: This guy thinks like me though it's old: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23563960/how-to-get-enum-value-by-string-or-int">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23563960/how-to-get-enum-value-by-string-or-int</a>
 Alshock: Question: when you get a bug (infinite loop in my case) that only happens out of your profiler, how do you track it down?
 Alshock: because I always feel like I'm back to good ol' printf, but that sounds quite archaic
 Beard: Alshock, if it works, why not?
 DatVu: printf strat for debugging is really useful
 DatVu: I use it most of the time
 ArianPunk: it's smth else
 ArianPunk: I tried tens of trials
 ArianPunk: with/without pointers in 2d arrays
 ArianPunk: none is working coz of scanf/fgets etc have problems when used in loops
 ArianPunk: im talking about C of course.
 Alshock: @ArianPunk Dearly beloved are you listening? I don't understand a word that you are saying.
 Alshock: what's the issue you have?
 IAmNoob: hi boyz
 ArianPunk: I was sayin that printf in C doesnt always help
 Alshock: oh yeah, that's not a very good debugging tool, but there my profiler just erased the bug smh.
 ArianPunk: you good at c?
 IAmNoob: i am good at c++
 IAmNoob: and those are related to each others
 ArianPunk: could you look at my code and see what's wrong with it?
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: what is the code about?
 ArianPunk: input two strings in a structure using scanf
 IAmNoob: k
 ArianPunk: (im solving MIME Type puzzle)
 ArianPunk: scanf is in a for loop
 IAmNoob: k
 ArianPunk: to make sure they are allocated, I use printf outside of the for loop.
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: i got this problem 
 wlesavo: talking about not cheating :slight_smile:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/469289907">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/469289907</a>
 wlesavo: sayonara does it
 ArianPunk: what I see is that scanf only allocate the last couple of inputs
 IAmNoob: sen dme the code so i can see
 ArianPunk: because printf only shows the very last inputs
 ArianPunk: ok
 IAmNoob: kkkk
 IAmNoob: a screenshot or somethinmg
 Astrobytes: lol wlesavo, as if we needed any further confirmation :D
 IAmNoob: wlesavo please explain

 IAmNoob: ArianPunk uhhh
 IAmNoob: i dont relly know whats happening
 IAmNoob: in c++
 IAmNoob: u aloc a struct like so:
 wlesavo: Astrobytes not that i obsessed with it :smiley:
 IAmNoob: {};struct
 Astrobytes: hehehe :D
 ArianPunk: my structure is ok.
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: i dont see ay mistake
 ArianPunk: scanf has problems when it comes to structures in loops
 wlesavo: at least he followed eulers advice and took a better ai
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: He's PM'ing me about why do we think he is cheating
 ature: hello everyone. noob here.
 IAmNoob: k
 ArianPunk: what about this one?
 ArianPunk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5284bd44-a62c-49b5-99d7-f01945098fea">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5284bd44-a62c-49b5-99d7-f01945098fea</a>
 IAmNoob: why a double pointer?
 ArianPunk: reckon it's a 2d array
 IAmNoob: u dont have string in c?
 ArianPunk: not that easy
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: u can use only a pointer 
 IAmNoob: not a double pointer 
 IAmNoob: or store them all
 ArianPunk: in C?
 IAmNoob: in an array
 ArianPunk: ive seen double pointers in books
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: but u can be smarter
 IAmNoob: and use arrays]
 IAmNoob: they are easier
 ArianPunk: ive tried both
 IAmNoob: k and why is the array infunctional
 ArianPunk: the latter i showed you is UB
 IAmNoob: have u made an array of pointers?
 ArianPunk: yeah i guess
 IAmNoob: k
 IAmNoob: because u dont have to
 IAmNoob: use only 
 IAmNoob: char v[1000];
 IAmNoob: and u readyt
 IAmNoob: and how to read u think
 darkhorse64: Look here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/5f47dac1fe5458d3d6d596f391d8c8cb7572263">https://www.codingame.com/profile/5f47dac1fe5458d3d6d596f391d8c8cb7572263</a> for a real cheater: Guru in two weeks starting from 0
 ArianPunk: char v[1000] in whre?
 ArianPunk: where*
 IAmNoob: at the start
 ArianPunk: what is V supposed to do?
 IAmNoob: is the name of the array
 ArianPunk: you means instead of sArray, i use v?
 IAmNoob: yes and declare it an array of chars
 ArianPunk: ok
 Jasperr: lol 27k CP in 3 days
 wlesavo: darkhorse64 well that one famous 
 Jasperr: guess hes very good at scraping GitHub
 darkhorse64: The other guy is just an amateur with his HS clone
 wlesavo: Jasperr nah, you dont realy need to be good at it
 darkhorse64: There is a search tool in Github
 wlesavo: shamelessness is enough
 Jasperr: I'm aware of the search tool, that was an attempt at sarcasm
 Illedan: 27k is the same as squiddy cheated with too xD
 Uljahn: those "guru-in-3-days" are so good at contest though :smirk:
 Uljahn: *contests
 darkhorse64: I have seen his questions during the contest: What is a BFS&#160;?
 Jasperr: I want to be guru in 3 months
 Jasperr: Quite an arbitrary goal, but a lot more feasible than 2 weeks&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Took me 18 months
 Jasperr: Wait 18 months of trying of 18 months being registered?
 Jasperr: or*
 darkhorse64: Since registration
 Astrobytes: darkhorse never sleeps, he just CGs 24/7
 Jasperr: hehe
 darkhorse64: Maybe obsessed a bit but I sleep. I certainly made progress once I stopped trying to improve my UTTT bot
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Jasperr: There is roughly 176k CP available from Code Golf + Optimization + Bots, you need 68k for Guru atm, no idea whether 3 months is feasible but we'll see
 Astrobytes: Always aim high&#160;:)
 Jasperr: That's the spirit
 Uljahn: ceg-way
 Astrobytes: lol, that's slightly different :D
 wlesavo: damn, im only 7 month on cg, it feels like it was forever
 Astrobytes: You settled in quickly 
 eulerscheZahl: i fully accepted you as a member and don't see you as a newbie anymore
 darkhorse64: My OOC bot will always remember you
 wlesavo: did you see that sayonara replay euler? :slight_smile:
 Uljahn: making accepted multi == not newb
 eulerscheZahl: i know a lot of sayonara replays
 eulerscheZahl: which one in particular?
 wlesavo: i mean from noob
 Uljahn: that was one from "im not a cheater"
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/469289907">https://www.codingame.com/replay/469289907</a>
 ArianPunk: I signed up here 1.5 year ago
 ArianPunk: started doing CG since last couple days
 wlesavo: but hypersonic looks realy fun, i should try it, loved to play bomberman in school
 Uljahn: I signed up 5+ years ago and still noob&#160;:(
 ArianPunk: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you learned python Uljahn
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe improved your English too, dunno
 Uljahn: ye, i even somtimes help others with python, quite an achievement
 Astrobytes: I signed up in 2015, but wasn't active until Code Royale. I have learned an absolute s**tload in the past 2 years
 Uljahn: i think CG constraints are good for learning advanced things

 WINWINWIN: :D
 eulerscheZahl: the clash has been cancelled

 WINWINWIN: Man, top 100 in 3 months should be crazy hard
 WINWINWIN: its been 2 months and after a LOT of help from Madknight Im top 1000
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your method to climb ranks
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 Marchete: top1 has 10 times the points of 1000th player, and 2.6 times the points of 100th
 WINWINWIN: Is  the fall challenge confirmed to be a solo?
 eulerscheZahl: but top1 is here for more than 10 times 3 months already
 Astrobytes: Where did you hear that WINWINWIN?
 WINWINWIN: on discord
 eulerscheZahl: solo game is most likely a placeholder
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: the API says it's solo and starts on october 23rd
 eulerscheZahl: but we don't know anything about the real contest
 Astrobytes: Staff said it was undecided, on discord
 Astrobytes: [CG]Thibaud05/19/2020it's not been decided internally yet
 Astrobytes: oups, a ping
 eulerscheZahl: no ping
 WINWINWIN: Ok, not really used to solos
 eulerscheZahl: because there is no space between nick and date
 Astrobytes: Ah. no space, nice
 Astrobytes: beat me again euler :P
 eulerscheZahl: it's gotten a habit
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 dbdr: &gt; The most interesting moment in my implementation was the searching for a  bug almost 3 days and at the end it appeared to be uninitialized float.Something that a compiler can detect automatically in a second. Why do people do that to themselves?
 eulerscheZahl: what are these miraculous warnings everyone is talking about? how do I enable them?
 dbdr: depends on the language
 dbdr: if a language cannot do that, it's not even worth using. But i think all major ones have something like that
 eulerscheZahl: don't pull a smits and seriously try to answer my nonsense question now
 dbdr: :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: I think --help-me-I-am-dumb works with most compilers
 eulerscheZahl: -Wallbecause you are hitting wall when you try by hand
 dbdr: -WonderWall for the next level
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 dbdr: of course in good languages it's not a warning, it's an error&#160;:)
 ArianPunk: The negative thing in CG is auto-generated codes.
 eulerscheZahl: i disagree
 eulerscheZahl: it helps parsing the inputs and you are always free to replace it
 ArianPunk: you think you have the optimized code style but then In the end I rewrite the whole code on my own thought. 
 Uljahn: lol wut
 ArianPunk: MIME Type puzzle for instance, I'm writing the whole thing using **pointers
 dbdr: because performance is critical in MIME Types, obviously
 eulerscheZahl: even for bot contests when i finish with 1.5k lines, i use the default code to get started and usually keep it till the end (even if I move the lines to different places)
 Astrobytes: Yep. In fact, probably can't pass MIME Types without using AVX
 ArianPunk: right
 Astrobytes: \s
 Uljahn: so you need pragmas in c++ stub :thinking:
 ArianPunk: stub??
 Astrobytes: Ofc. Especially for the easy puzzles.
 Uljahn: stub == default code
 Astrobytes: Performance was so critical in Onboarding I had to use inline asm
 ArianPunk: astro you use C++?
 Astrobytes: Yep. I'm trolling tho'
 eulerscheZahl: you can easily solve the mime puzzle without optimizing the input reading
 ArianPunk: easy puzzles done in languages like C deserves higher XPs. it's unfair.
 ArianPunk: I did everything on the default code
 Astrobytes: It's unfair? You just need to improve your C skills.
 ArianPunk: You CANNOT return EXT &amp; MT from scanf unless you allocate space
 Uljahn: just use D :relieved:
 Astrobytes: ^
 ArianPunk: One could use python and solve MIME easily
 Astrobytes: If you're competent in C, you can solve it in C. Believe me.
 ArianPunk: It's not why I said
 ArianPunk: what*
 ArianPunk: and what I meant
 ArianPunk: you do it in a hard way
 ArianPunk: Like when you play a game hard mode, you gain higher XP
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P0JM3h7IQk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P0JM3h7IQk</a>
 reCurse: That's a level of gamification that's not only unnecessary but completely arbitrary
 Astrobytes: :D
 RoboStac: but in that case you are playing a harder game. In this case you are playing the same game but doing it with your eyes shut because you want too
 DatVu: I just competed in a problem that's actually good in CoC
 reCurse: I shouldn't gain extra points because I decided to write the thing in brainfuck
 reCurse: That's my own stupidity
 RoboStac: (and yes, I think everyone will agree that anything involving strings in c is going to be painful)
 Astrobytes: +1
 DatVu: +1
 eulerscheZahl: ++
 DatVu: as a C/C++ coder
 DatVu: I strongly agree
 ArianPunk: recurse, if youre telling me indirectly im a brainfuck, then ur plain stupid
 reCurse: No not at all
 reCurse: brainfuck is a programming language
 Astrobytes: brainfuck is an esoteric programming language ArianPunk
 reCurse: And before jumping to conclusions try to be nicer
 ArianPunk: in ur next sentence you said 'my own stupidity'
 reCurse: Yeah because that would be really stupid to write it in brainfuck
 reCurse: Even if it's harder
 ArianPunk: so you're telling me I'm stupid
 reCurse: Why are you so defensive
 Astrobytes: That's some reasoning there
 reCurse: It's not about you at all
 eulerscheZahl: at this point you can't say anything to make the situation better
 ArianPunk: Coz' you think too naroow
 reCurse: Right.
 reCurse: I'm not the one making up imaginary insults
 ArianPunk: I'm training C here. That's all. and I've come to this conclusion that it gets harder in langs. like C]
 reCurse: Some things are harder in C, some are easier
 reCurse: There's not much point starting to go into detailed XP sheet for every puzzle/language combination
 reCurse: Based on an arbitrary difficulty metric
 ArianPunk: euler if you have your C code for MIME and you didnt use **pointers, then i would be glad to have it
 eulerscheZahl: i never bothered trying it in C
 RoboStac: if you've finished you can look at other solutions
 ArianPunk: So, why do you say that the default code is arright?
 ArianPunk: Robo, alright.
 RoboStac: mine doesn't use any double pointers 
 ArianPunk: I submit it, roboStac, u did it in C? i'll chekc urs
 Jasperr: ð¿
 Alshock: what's wrong with double pointers?
 Alshock: ArianPunk now you're trying to cheat? When you solve a puzzle you gain access to other solutions in tha language
 Alshock: That's a good starting point to improve your solutions 
 ArianPunk: what???? I'm trying to cheat??!!!
 reCurse: Yeah I don't see it either
 ArianPunk: you ok? nothing is wrong with pointers.
 Gerbil: Wow... :eyes:
 Marchete: in case of doubts use pointers, that's the safest way. Or double pointers for 2x the safety
 eulerscheZahl: this chat is getting weird. I miss the contest with other chat activities
 Gerbil: And use GOTOs for efficiency.
 Marchete: goto to the contents of a double pointer, what can go wrong?
 ArianPunk: I just was talking about auto-generated codes. Dunno how it's got to pointers.
 jacek: Automaton2000 its a mystery
 Automaton2000: i don't know where you are stuck
 ArianPunk: Me?
 Alshock: Automaton2000 is a bot ArianPunk
 Automaton2000: i have seen that coming
 ArianPunk: lol
 eulerscheZahl: you just ruined the fun Alshock
 Alshock: xD sorry to badmouth you, be he's got to know
 Alshock: @eulerscheZahlfrom the conversation earlier I felt a drama bomb coming
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN can help
 AutomatonNN: current start of the contest is the game
 Jasperr: theres two of them??
 Jasperr: lol
 eulerscheZahl: there's also Neumam. but rarely online
 Jasperr: nice
 ArianPunk: euler, you wanted to make fun o me with thid bot?
 eulerscheZahl: I think it's time for me to leave
 reCurse: You have defensiveness issues
 Alshock: that's the whole purpose of there being a bot, so that people might confuse them for humans and start a conversation
 reCurse: Stop it
 ArianPunk: But that's mockery.
 Alshock: everyone here just like pointing at others and laugh, that's a bully gang
 Alshock: (psssst that's a joke and I'm actually making fun of you)
 ArianPunk: yeah, i felt that.
 Alshock: which makes my point valid, so... I guess you're left with your sense of judgement
 Alshock: Only answer if you want to, but do you happen to spend time on social media by any chance, ArianPunk?
 ArianPunk: yeah
 ArianPunk: weird question 
 Gerbil: I found a spider in my butt.  I named it groceries.
 Uljahn: i found a bug in my bot, i named it feature
 reCurse: Not sure what's up with chat today
 reCurse: Gonna get my broom
 eulerscheZahl: how did the moving go? was it within your city or a larger distance?
 reCurse: Pretty good, it was a really short distance
 reCurse: Home owner now
 eulerscheZahl: great
 Jasperr: Congrats
 reCurse: Thanks
 Alshock: gg wp, sry for the chat I give it back
 reCurse: Also why I had to give up on utg back then :p
 newbiecoder: I have a question how tf can I understand coding language I'm stil lvery new to coding 
 reCurse: It's not a teaching website, more of a practice one
 newbiecoder: I know
 newbiecoder: but still
 newbiecoder: where can I find a teaching one
 newbiecoder: I'm tryna learn in python
 ArianPunk: Coursera
 eulerscheZahl: SeraWhatever will be will be
 Alshock: @newbiecoder open classroom should ba accessible as well
 Alshock: que sera sera @eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 eulerscheZahl: coursera sera
 Natorade: u can learn on hackerrank too
 Alshock: con mi alto levelo of spanish I'm quite proud of getting the pun x)
 Natorade: you can also go to codeforces and look at other people's solutions to problems in any language
 ArianPunk: what's sera? you like it?
 eulerscheZahl: others recommend udemy or khan academy.i don't know either of them, just sharing sites that seem popular
 eulerscheZahl: the Sera was trollingyou started with Coursera. I appended Sera as a reference to Que Sera Sera...
 eulerscheZahl: and the joke isn't funny anymore when you have to explain it&#160;:(
 ReborN: :D
 ArianPunk: sera:the watery portion of an animal fluid remaining after coagulation.
 MSmits: hi
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 eulerscheZahl: are you here to approve Yinsh?
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: no didnt know it was up
 MSmits: I've just been to work in the first time in 2 weeks
 MSmits: i'm headed home in the train
 eulerscheZahl: 1 approval missing, online for 5 days
 eulerscheZahl: how did the teaching go?
 MSmits: no teaching today, lots of meetings and such
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 MSmits: some students came to see if i graded their tests correctly
 MSmits: spoiler: I did
 eulerscheZahl: great
 eulerscheZahl: grade*
 MSmits: I will be teaching for 2 weeks
 MSmits: every tuesday morning and friday afternoon
 MSmits: after that it's test-week and after that just some meetings and stuff leading into summer vacation
 MSmits: i mean teaching at work, not distance
 eulerscheZahl: weird days to live in
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: we had a lot of desinfectant at work
 Alshock: @MSmits the live version of "excuse me sir, I think there's a bug with the test case of The Descent?"
 MSmits: it's safe in the Netherlands though, my students wont drink it
 MSmits: Alshock yeah
 eulerscheZahl: why should you want to drink it?
 MSmits: i dunno, good question, ask some leaders in governments
 eulerscheZahl: it's even painful on the hands when the cat was faster than me while playing. no way i'll put that into my body
 MSmits: oh yes, it burns the scratches
 MSmits: thats how you know it's working :P
 reCurse: I mean some ate tide pods
 reCurse: Disinfectant seems milder
 reCurse: Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor
 MSmits: yes, also not in my country i think :P
 eulerscheZahl: natural selection
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: once a classmate told that to his mother when she came back from holidays and he didn't feel like watering the plants for 2 weeks
 eulerscheZahl: didn't turn well
 MSmits: there must be several biology teachers that used this example
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: well its true, if she gave him several plants over the years, all he would be left with is cacti
 MSmits: i once got a cactus from my boss and didnt feel like taking it home, i dumped it in a mail corner and came back after 6 weeks
 MSmits: it was fine
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 reCurse: Is it a gift?
 MSmits: eah
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: I mean
 eulerscheZahl: for summer holidays
 MSmits:  a mini-cactus
 eulerscheZahl: bring it back after
 MSmits: thats what teachers get reCurse
 MSmits: you get a big bonus, we get a cactus
 reCurse: Seems like that's what you give to bad teachers
 reCurse: Good teachers get apples
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: ttyl, train arriving
 Astrobytes: Really not sure why I bothered to read the chat I missed whilst making dinner... 
 Jasperr: quality content â¢ï¸

 Jasperr: Not at all, was just checking whether I could send from a XMPP client
 Astrobytes: Ah, it's lagging for me
 Astrobytes: Well, not now

 IvailoManolov: Hello 
 IvailoManolov: I want to ask you guys something 
 IvailoManolov: It is about the defibrillators puzzle . Im writing it in C just because i like how clearer the memory looks compared to other languages 
 IvailoManolov: in Python3 i have the 100% obviously it is an easy puzzle 
 IvailoManolov: here however i wrote 100 line sof code and it performed well in the test cases but when i submited it it says that it failed in the single choice sector
 IvailoManolov: i have 75&#160;% 
 IvailoManolov: any ideas&#160;?&#160;:/ 
 IvailoManolov: why that may be the cae&#160;?
 IvailoManolov: Single possibility was failed 
 Astrobytes: Try making your own test case with a single possibility, to help you debug your issue
 IvailoManolov: Thats what i did currently while waiting on the answer
 IvailoManolov: worked like a charm&#160;:) Thanks Astrobytes&#160;!

 Astrobytes: Lions are larger than domestic cats.
 jacek: what about domestic lions
 Astrobytes: You shouldn't have a domestic lion, bad for the lion.
 jrke: solaimanope try python or ruby
 jacek: domestic python?
 Astrobytes: Wild.
 Brokolis: I would go as far as to say you cannot win shortest code with c++

 eulerscheZahl: it has formatting
 dbdr: yes, I noticed that before&#160;:)
 dbdr: looks nice, no?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: planned feature or how did that happen?
 struct: So you did copy paste, I did not know this IamCopy
 eulerscheZahl: yes, nice
 dbdr: the source XMPP has:&lt;body&gt;Find 3 distinc cpu: Intel Haswell
 dbdr: the only special thing I can see is the newline
 .Mr.: Hello everybody!
 trictrac: hello all, struct&#160;: only one validation requested fot yinsh&#160;!! Near the goal&#160;!!
 struct: Yeah, let's hope some people play it
 trictrac: the graphics and the animations are beautiful
 Astrobytes: trictrac, which board do you prefer?
 jacek: eeyup
 darkhorse64: You have made progress in this respect
 trictrac: the one with hexagon
 trictrac: not the lines
 jacek: lines are more beautiful. hexes are more practical
 Astrobytes: I like the lines, but both are useable
 dbdr: ah no, I think it's newline + one leading space
 trictrac: the rules are not so easy at the begining that perhaps the reason why not many people allready test &amp; play
 struct: btw, do you want me to allow to add messages?
 eulerscheZahl: let's test it:
 struct: Rules can be tricky yeah
 Astrobytes: I'm working on some other stuff atm, bad timing for Yinsh for me
 eulerscheZahl: the troll got a lot of players already. no thrilling game IMO. but you understand it without a statement
 trictrac: but the fact that the leader has less ring (disadvantage) is new on CG
 Brokolis: what is yinsh?
 struct: dark horse did you just write the message'
 eulerscheZahl: so you were right about the space
 struct: It didnt seem to work
 dbdr: it's like 4 spaces meaning monospace in markdown, but a single one is enough
 eulerscheZahl: does that mean I can add a
 darkhorse64: My approval seems rejected, sorry struct
 struct: lol
 dbdr: updated
 trictrac: you need to make an advise
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/bf8s08dmoqv41.png">https://i.redd.it/bf8s08dmoqv41.png</a>
 dbdr: yes :D
 struct: Should I report it?
 trictrac: noy only an approval
 trictrac: not
 struct: but dark horse aprooved
 struct: and did not work
 darkhorse64: I did it wrong&#160;?
 struct: Did you just write a message?
 struct: or did you press the aprooval button?
 darkhorse64: I did. I see them
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot of your approve button?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/soam7j">https://prnt.sc/soam7j</a>
 jacek: too lazy to make proper bot. tried from the referee but the move generation relies on ui
 darkhorse64: I see a green button but I had also an internal error
 struct: yeah jacek referee is a mess
 darkhorse64: It is not the first game I approve. It worked before
 eulerscheZahl: weird
 jacek: yes, i got internal error too
 eulerscheZahl: thiiiibaaaud
 jacek: time for... BUG REPORT
 darkhorse64: yinsh is doomed
 struct: It was never meant to be released&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: illedan did you update SR?
 eulerscheZahl: "the teapot also tried it" :D
 Snef: struct when i use left and right arrow to controll frames it also scroll the rules&#160;:/
 struct: o.o
 jacek: huh
 darkhorse64: With latest updates from Illedan, SR works OK for me
 eulerscheZahl: but illedan likes to break other parts of the platform with his uploads
 eulerscheZahl: scroll the statement horizontally or vertically?
 AntiSquid: did yinsh break in between updates?
 AntiSquid: have you tried reuploading?
 trictrac: snef on atari go inputs are updated, if you want to update your bot (now the score is provided)
 eulerscheZahl: when your window has too little width, the scrolling on arrow keys is normal
 AntiSquid: (was looking forward to BOGOL, don't care as much about yinsh, sorry about the harsh truth)
 darkhorse64: trictrac: how did you write the go so fast, the engine is not a two liner&#160;? 
 darkhorse64: g*go bot*
 AntiSquid: are those pointers?
 trictrac: no only the move generator &amp; the play action
 jacek: should be extra points for writing bot in go
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 trictrac: :grinning:
 AntiSquid: :D
 darkhorse64: liberties, capture are not obvious
 AntiSquid: ban
 darkhorse64: go go
 AntiSquid: for breaking smiley chain
 trictrac: with bitboard is easy
 darkhorse64: go for go go
 jacek: bitboard with 81bits?
 darkhorse64: "bitboard is easy" is the quote of the day
 trictrac: yes 2 uint64
 darkhorse64: no SSE&#160;?
 MSmits: as you do
 struct: oh nice spot dbdr
 Astrobytes: gawd I was literally about to say where's MSbits
 trictrac: no SSE
 MSmits: someone pinged me by saying bitboard
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: wtf is SSE&#160;?
 AntiSquid: make me think of this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sse.co.uk/home">https://sse.co.uk/home</a>
 eulerscheZahl: avx
 MSmits: vectorization
 dbdr: now we know the pseudo of your alr MSmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes&#160;:(
 trictrac: like MSmits, i do many bitboard
 dbdr: alt
 MSmits: trictrac spends a lot of time on boardgames
 dbdr: SSE is the ancestor of AVX
 struct: Also this part of my statement is so wrong dbdr "If you jumped over rings"
 jacek: i wonder how easy would be bitboard for 15x15 gomoku
 MSmits: it's just more uint64
 dbdr: not sure why that part is wrong, but feel free to correct further&#160;:)
 struct: we cant jump over rings
 struct: just markers
 trictrac: agreed with MSmits more uint64
 dbdr: seems like very little of that rule made sense then :D
 MSmits: row of 15 fits 4x in uint64
 jacek: placing stone would be easy, but how to easily check for 5-in-row then?
 MSmits: pext, pdep etc.
 MSmits: there's probably a way
 MSmits: sometimes it's complicated, but still fast
 jacek: for one 64bit it would be i&amp;(i&gt;&gt;1)&amp;(i&gt;&gt;2) etc
 Astrobytes: What about bextr?
 MSmits: never used bextr
 MSmits: might be there'sa use for it
 struct: What are max turns for gomoku?
 jacek: 225
 MSmits: hmm 5 in a row gomuku, let me think
 trictrac: 80 for the proposed 9x9
 eulerscheZahl: struct has a new project now
 CaillouBOB: hi
 Astrobytes: bextr extracts consecutive bits
 AntiSquid: so no yinsh&#160;?
 MSmits: oh, sounds useful Astrobytes
 struct: You want gomoku?
 Astrobytes: I told you about it before MSmits
 AntiSquid: dunno what that is
 MSmits: yes, i recognized the name
 eulerscheZahl: i have no opinion on Gomoku
 MSmits: I just didnt remember what it did
 Astrobytes: Tbf, I just remembered it
 AntiSquid: add chinese chess or shogi  rather than gomoku struct
 MSmits: I am just waiting for kar liso to come on and tell me he was there when you said it and i reacted the same way then
 jacek: gomoku is solved, even with simple swap
 Astrobytes: lol MemorySmits time :D
 AntiSquid: one game that can't really be added to CG: texas holdem up poker
 MSmits: heh yeah
 AntiSquid: not enough turns
 AntiSquid: even for 2v2 it's kinda difficult 
 MSmits: how many do you need?
 MSmits: well gonna catch some sleep. Didn't get enough last night. gn all!
 eulerscheZahl: that was unexpected
 eulerscheZahl: good night
 struct: trictrac any game you would like to see here?
 jacek: can you access talkchess.com? i have forbidden
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits
 Illedan: What is the new project of struct?
 Illedan: And smitty sleeping before euler?!
 AntiSquid: well if i count correctly it's minimum 10 turns per round for 2 player mode, so max 60 rounds? and if someone raises and the opponent re-raise ...
 struct: I can jacek
 AntiSquid: maybe poker would be better as a minigame inside of an actual game, kind of like RPS in Pacman&#160;?
 jacek: hmm
 Astrobytes: Would have to be a simplified CG-version I think AntiSquid
 jacek: was i banned? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: fall contest: another atari game but with poker inside it
 Astrobytes: CG Milliseconds Hold 'em Poker
 DiL: hello! is it possible to disable autocomplete in IDE?
 AntiSquid: wait notatari
 AntiSquid: maybe i need sleep
 Astrobytes: No but you can disable auto-accept on 'Enter' in the Settings at the left
 Astrobytes: @DiL
 AntiSquid: what did you do on talchess jacek?
 DiL: thanks Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: np
 trictrac: struct&#160;: your choices are good 
 jacek: AntiSquid nothing, i only read there
 Astrobytes: trictrac - what is the game of trictrac? I've seen references to it as some kind of backgammon variant?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halma</a>
 eulerscheZahl: (just throwing random games in the chat)
 trictrac: you are right, but i select this name because it's the name of 2 particular locations on international checkers (i have done many version of international draught program since more than 20 years)
 Astrobytes: Haven't seen that before euler
 dbdr: I played Halma as a kid!
 wlesavo: oh, we played something simmilar
 wlesavo: not exactly the sme though
 Astrobytes: I see trictrac, and nice! That's some good experience you have there&#160;;)
 trictrac: yes all kinds of alpha-beta / pruning / etc ...&#160;!!
 jacek: no mcts?
 Astrobytes: Certainly explains your mastery of the alpha-beta&#160;;)
 jacek: youre gonna need one for go ~
 trictrac: no mcts, but ML to compute weights of eval functions
 jacek: nice
 trictrac: i do somethink like that on breaktrough.
 trictrac: My first MCTS is on yinsh
 Astrobytes: God help us all :D
 kovi: halma as a kid yeah
 kovi: was one of the earliest game besides chess
 Astrobytes:  I rarely played any board games other than chess as a kid (my grandfather used to organise chess tournaments and ran a club in my town)
 AntiSquid: childhood board games? :thinking: Monopoloy on CG&#160;!
 AntiSquid: Monopoly 
 AntiSquid: *
 Astrobytes: I suppose some dice-dependent games like Monopoly are doable with some kind of ISMCTS 
 eulerscheZahl: or by modifying the rules to remove the dice
 Astrobytes: CG-Monopoly
 AntiSquid: + make some inputs hidden
 Astrobytes: And fog of war
 eulerscheZahl: monopoly is too much about luck
 Astrobytes: Yep
 eulerscheZahl: die siedler von catan might be doable without die
 Jasperr: Catan without dice?
 Jasperr: How would that work
 eulerscheZahl: giving fixed income for each cell
 Jasperr: Oh
 eulerscheZahl: and adjusting the prices
 Astrobytes: Hmmm
 Astrobytes: Could be interesting
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. you need 10 wood + 10 stone for a street. and some cells give you 1 wood per turn, others give 3
 AntiSquid: diceless yahtzee
 Astrobytes: Shut up AntiSquid :D
 Jasperr: :P
 Snef: for monpoly you could do&#160;:you can choose the value of the dicebut youhave to use all value of a dice before being able to reuse one value
 Snef: like 6-&gt;4-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;5 then you can reuse 6
 AntiSquid: just roll doubles
 Snef: you can do only one dice
 Astrobytes: Not sure if that would work out too well. You'd probably have better results with fixed moves (perhaps dependent on some other factor), modifying the game as euler said
 AntiSquid: could work if you have something like a set of cards with numbers instead of dice
 AntiSquid: so both players get same 5 numbers at the start randomly
 AntiSquid: then they spend 2 numbers of their choice per turn
 AntiSquid: next turn both get same 2 new random numbers
 AntiSquid: but first player to land on a proprety can buy it so, replay with different starting order to make it symmetrical or what
 Astrobytes: With fog of war right? So you can only see 1 square ahead? :P
 DragonJ: my CSB code isnt running and isnt giving an error.... 
 AntiSquid: lol why the fog of war Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Just using the latest CG meme AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: It's the most hated feature currently no? :D
 dbdr: monopoly: every time a dice is needed, all players simultaneously give some amount of money. the one giving the most choses the value of the dice (moving player in case of equality)
 Astrobytes: Interesting idea
 dbdr: -&gt;  no luck
 dbdr: might be interesting also, you can force the player to visit you :D
 dbdr: unless they pay more
 Astrobytes: Which of course has consequences of it's own
 dbdr: crazy meta I think! :D
 dbdr: because you can also decide not to pay and let the other waste their money
 Astrobytes: Meta-meta's possible I believe :D
 DragonJ: How can I chat on here if it says I have no internet???

 Astrobytes: CG platform is bugged. My code doesn't work 
 Astrobytes: (â¯Â°â¡Â°ï¼â¯ï¸µ â»ââ»
 DragonJ: they have changed the game run settings which has made all the computer protections activate ugh
 Astrobytes: (jokes aside, I am just now getting network error status: -1 :D )
 AbundantPuddle: I agree Astro. Something severely wrong on CG servers. Needs fixed ASAP.
 DragonJ: I also have been getting an error called unknown...
 AbundantPuddle: But I'm not sure about your network issues. :joy:
 Astrobytes: My initial comment was actually just about my idiotic bugs in my code but since then CG has indeed been misbehaving
 DragonJ: they try using facebook to run stuff and facebook it expects as malware lol
 Astrobytes: What's FB got to do with it?
 Astrobytes: (facebook not Fantastic Bits for any pedants watching)
 DragonJ: apparently the  CSB visual is from facebook
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, I was blaming GC for my code not working. I have noticed some errors here and there. Wasn't sure if it was just me and/or intermittent.
 Astrobytes: As a mostly general rule: when red boxes pop up it's them, otherwise you did it. 
 Astrobytes: Mostly.
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, except I do a lot of goofy things with my network.
 AbundantPuddle: :sweat_smile:
 DragonJ: right now my csb code ran but did nothing and gave no errors
 Astrobytes: Show replay DragonJ
 DragonJ: I cant click replay even
 Astrobytes: Um.. screenshot?
 DragonJ: the entire CSB is down because it thinks facebook is malware
 AbundantPuddle: Are you referring to Coders Strike Back?
 DragonJ: yeah
 Astrobytes: I assure you, it works perfectly
 AbundantPuddle: I'm in there right now with submitted code. It seems to be working fine on my end.

 Astrobytes: Wait, your antivirus is telling you this?
 DragonJ: yeah 
 DragonJ: facebook replays

 AbundantPuddle: Lol

 DragonJ: 1+1=2 unless the computer is blocked from seeing one of the 1's XD
 AbundantPuddle: I haven't worked with kaspersky in a while. Does it give you the option to add exemptions?
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Your parents can do this for you if you don't have rights. There's nothing malicious about codingame
 AbundantPuddle: Well except some of the coders. Most of them not intentionally. :joy:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's that :DBut seriously tho' DragonJ, as long as your system is free of any malware you're fine to add an exception for CG
 AbundantPuddle: I'm curious as to why some parts of CG are being blocked while others are not. Is it only code compilation that is giving you trouble? You seem to be able to access chat just fine.
 Astrobytes: Embedded bit and pieces are probably triggering it. I'm no expert but I'd guess it's false positives.
 Astrobytes: *bits
 Astrobytes: Anyway
 DragonJ: Its only the images and replays
 Astrobytes: I have failed enough for today
 Astrobytes: Goodnight all
 AbundantPuddle: Good night Astro
 AbundantPuddle: How about the "Play My Code?" Does that work?
 DragonJ: no it runs but no images and replays
 DragonJ: except static ones
 AbundantPuddle: By images, do you mean the frame by frame video?
 DragonJ: yeah
 DragonJ: and other similar things
 AbundantPuddle: Oh wait, okay. So when you say replay, you're not referring to the "Replay In Same Conditions," are you?
 AbundantPuddle: Can you access the settings in the replay window?
 DragonJ: only the action settings
 DragonJ: the replay info is empty
 AbundantPuddle: Does Kaspersky give any info? Does this happen on other challenges as well, or just CSB?
 DragonJ: others but worst on CSB
 reCurse: Kaspersky is the real malware
 AbundantPuddle: Sorry, had to do something real quick. You still there DragonJ?
 AbundantPuddle: You ain't wrong reCurse.
 DragonJ: so (velocityangle+distangle/2)=actualangle?
 AbundantPuddle: Which league are you in?
 DragonJ: Bronze and gold depends on account
 DragonJ: but working on bronze presently
 AbundantPuddle: Are you still talking about CSB?

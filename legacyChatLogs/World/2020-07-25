 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday
 jrke: happy Caturday to all codingamers&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: finished clash path!
 eulerscheZahl: #metoo
 AntiSquid: just need the contrib challenge done
 eulerscheZahl: and that was my last path missing
 AntiSquid: either multi or optim 
 jrke: oh so you were clashing for path
 AntiSquid: still deciding on a game
 eulerscheZahl: or CoC, also counts
 jrke: my one path is left
 jrke: weekly puzzle one left
 AntiSquid: nah i don't want to be responsible for coc rising in popularity, site has too much coc as it is
 eulerscheZahl: 681
 jrke: euler how many clash participation do you have?
 eulerscheZahl: 114
 jrke: just 
 eulerscheZahl: played long ago when i was new to CG
 jrke: mine is 1660&#160;;)
 Xcalibre: oof flex
 eulerscheZahl: got bored when i got the first duplicate tasks
 jrke: i m also bored fron clashes 
 jrke: from*
 AntiSquid: 543 here, what am i doing with my life?&#160;:(
 jrke: there is close encounter between euler and royale for first rank
 eulerscheZahl: and i got #1 back with these clashes, yeahfeels dirty&#160;:(
 jrke: :smiley:
 jrke: but clashes also gives 5000 cps
 AntiSquid: wala went hard on the leaderboard and now stopped?
 jrke: is there any update for fall challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: make your own challenge and pitch it to Thibaud
 AntiSquid: i am guessing late november if it happens this year otherwise postponed for january / late february, just have a feeling
 jrke: can we do it make our own challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: make a multiplayer with the SDK
 eulerscheZahl: and keep it secret, only show it thibaud
 jrke: ok
 NivethSaran: is there any way to see a list of puzzles that I've solved?
 jrke: but for that i need to learn java
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>at the bottom NivethSaran
 AntiSquid: what happened to the recurz multi?
 eulerscheZahl: and JVM language will do jrke
 AntiSquid: so jrke are you intending to make a multi?
 NivethSaran: thanks
 jrke: i wanna make but first i will learn java
 AntiSquid: java isn't hard if you know c++, it's just really ugly
 eulerscheZahl: and if you know C#, you are even closer to knowing Java
 eulerscheZahl: and you could also use Kotlin, Scala, Clojure or Groovy if you want
 jrke: yeah currently im working on pac will work on it for max 2 days then i will start java
 AntiSquid: jrke here is a quick java tutorial that will help you adapt quicker:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projects.haykranen.nl/java/">https://projects.haykranen.nl/java/</a>
 jrke: ah! sounds goods.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/">https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: don't praise AntiSquid's link before you've seen the content of it :D
 AntiSquid: nah, he has a good eye
 eulerscheZahl: where is my struct? i think i broke him&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: burnt out?
 jrke: Oh euler you made OOC?
 eulerscheZahl: i took over when it was almost done. and Illedan made the majority of what was missing
 jrke: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: for kutulu i helped more than OOC
 jrke: is there any split func in c++?
 AntiSquid: my ooc rank didn't change much, guess it was stupid hard afterall
 jrke: :smiley:
 Xcalibre: jrke for splitting strings i use regex
 eulerscheZahl: OOC lasted 4 weeks. so you need a better bot for the same ranking
 jrke: ya 
 jrke: dunno what i joined cg in last week of march and that OOC was going to begin just beagn didn't remember so i just registered in contest and just submitted default code and didn't worked on it cause i didn't get the rules that time and few days ago i revisted OOC and in 7 minutes i made first league and top 100 in wood 1
 jrke: you can say this is my improvement
 AntiSquid: ya that's good start if you don't stop there, i was about to quit in wood :p
 jrke: currently im still in wood 1 cause i didn't worked on it after that&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and now you have to write a multiplayer
 eulerscheZahl: just use previous contests as orientation for complexity
 jrke: ya im thinking
 eulerscheZahl: a board game probably won't be accepted
 eulerscheZahl: i mean a simple one like othello
 jrke: oh
 jrke: but before that i have to make lost child ep 2
 jrke: puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: nah you don't
 jrke: no my idea is ready im working on its sol.
 eulerscheZahl: and the idea is?
 SilverShade: hi
 jrke: Cube solving
 spnn: hi
 eulerscheZahl: so just a BFS in 3D?
 jrke: it will be something like you have been given a solvable condition of cube and you have to output no.of turns required to solve it
 jrke: its simple for you guys
 eulerscheZahl: but this time it's in a shopping mall. and the mom is called out to pick up her child, while the child is just waiting there
 jrke: not for me&#160;;)
 jrke: nope not in shopping mall story that im thinking is-
 eulerscheZahl: hm, solve a cube? how do you solve it?like a rubiks cube?
 jrke: yeah 3*3 rubiks cube
 jrke: i kept only 12 moves
 eulerscheZahl: non trivial
 eulerscheZahl: state count explodes
 eulerscheZahl: and i get easily confused with 3D rotations there, not trivial to code
 jrke: yeah thats why its solution is taking time
 jrke: in real life my record is 53 seconds for solving 3*3 cube.
 jrke: in Code it could be in 53 ms&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and then only a few players will try to solve your puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: a contest has 2k+ players
 eulerscheZahl: and CG sends you a canvas with the contest artwork
 jrke: its not contest its just puzzle the lost child ep2
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: but your java multiplayer game...
 eulerscheZahl: i tell you to shift your priorities
 jrke: ok
 jrke: but how to upload multi on cg
 jrke: or refree
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>
 eulerscheZahl: create button at the top right
 eulerscheZahl: then select multiplayer game
 eulerscheZahl: and set the state to private (it's public by default)
 AntiSquid: multiplayer game discussion thread for unlocking the path <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/multiplayer-game-ideas-general-discussion/185643">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/multiplayer-game-ideas-general-discussion/185643</a> if anyone is interested
 jrke: there is an upload option what i have to upload there
 AntiSquid: a game zip like the one you get from github when you download other multis for CG
 eulerscheZahl: a zip file
 jrke: what does that zip file consist of?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/game-skeleton">https://github.com/CodinGame/game-skeleton</a>you start with this
 AntiSquid: which is really convinient since struct done a lot of improvements / additions and you can for example take Yinsh and modify it :p
 eulerscheZahl: build and run it offline, it will create a local website
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, look at other games for ideas how to code stuff
 AntiSquid: specifically look at the viewer features he added
 jrke: how to build it? 
 jrke: i don't know anything 
 eulerscheZahl: not only struct. there are a lot of other contributionsand the official docs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775</a>
 eulerscheZahl: afk for breakfast
 eulerscheZahl: did i kill the chat by leaving?
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: to you as well
 jrke: do i need eclipse for that?
 jacek: intellij idea is better
 <b>**eulerscheZahl uses intelliJ too</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: but eclipse will work
 eulerscheZahl: the intelliJ community edition is free
 jrke: im confused what to do&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: do you have an IDE (eclipse or intelliJ) installed?
 jrke: its downloading
 jrke: which is better 
 jrke: intellij or eclipse
 eulerscheZahl: for my taste: intelliJ
 jrke: k
 eulerscheZahl: but eclipse is popular for a reason as well
 jrke: im installing both then
 eulerscheZahl: both will do the job :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have both too
 eulerscheZahl: and Netbeans
 jrke: netbeans is good by big brother learned java when he was in school in netbeans only
 eulerscheZahl: and VS Code, MonoDevelop, Geany
 eulerscheZahl: i'm and IDE hoarder :o
 eulerscheZahl: texmaker
 jrke: my net is taking too much time
 eulerscheZahl: not downloaded yet?
 jrke: nope
 jrke: very slow net
 eulerscheZahl: you can download the game skeleton or a multiplayer of your choice in the mean tie
 eulerscheZahl: time
 jrke: game skeleton zip downloaded 
 eulerscheZahl: then you wait for the IDE
 jrke: k
 jrke: .kts which lang is this
 eulerscheZahl: what did you install? eclipse or intelliJ?
 jrke: intellji
 jrke: installing
 jrke: eclipse downloading
 eulerscheZahl: then open intelliJ
 eulerscheZahl: file -&gt; new -&gt; project from existing sources
 jrke: its installing yet
 eulerscheZahl: and select the .pom file from the game skeleton you just downloaded
 jrke: looks its installing something else also in intellji
 eulerscheZahl: JDK maybe?
 jrke: downloading jbr-x86
 jacek: or malware O:
 jrke: what it means
 jacek: jetbrains runtime
 jrke: now extracting
 eulerscheZahl: "This option should only be used if your are working on 32-bit OS that doesn't allow running 64-bit JDK."
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360003446060-Download-and-install-JBR-x86-option-during-install-">https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360003446060-Download-and-install-JBR-x86-option-during-install-</a>
 eulerscheZahl: let's just wait and see what happens
 jrke: its showing config or installation folder
 jrke: when opening
 jrke: or don't import settings
 AntiSquid: was there a downgrade for webchat on CG? the history of the chat is much smaller than it used to be
 AntiSquid: i could leave it open and scroll back like 2 hours or so
 jrke: ya now its 1 hour
 jrke: what to do now i installed intellji
 AntiSquid: lol no, now it looks like there's a max message count
 eulerscheZahl: isn't it depending on the amount of mesasges?
 eulerscheZahl: i mean always has been
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl 08:59AMthen open intelliJfile -&gt; new -&gt; project from existing sources
 jrke: when im opening intellji
 jrke: its showing me
 jrke: its showing config or installation folder
 AntiSquid: there are far fewer messages to scroll back to
 jrke: or don't import settings
 jrke: two options
 AntiSquid: might need to get pidgin&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: you can probably just click ok
 AntiSquid: didn't like the interface
 jrke: opened intellji
 jrke: now
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl 09:08AMeulerscheZahl 08:59AMfile -&gt; new -&gt; project from existing sources
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl 09:00AMand select the .pom file from the game skeleton you just downloaded
 eulerscheZahl: you done?
 jrke: just a moment it hanged 
 jrke: my lap is working like a crap
 tomatoes: just opening folder should be fine
 eulerscheZahl: the Bender optim is working like a crab.it's featuring Zoidberg
 eulerscheZahl: i like bad jokes
 AntiSquid: jrke&#160;: My mom bought me this new laptop and it gets really hot when the chat is being spamed. Now my leg is starting to hurt because it is getting so hot. Please, if you don't want me to get burned, then dont spam the chat.
 eulerscheZahl: i don't consider him spamming
 AntiSquid: what
 AntiSquid: that's a copy pasta meme
 eulerscheZahl: never seen that
 AntiSquid: was a reference to his laptop being slow
 eulerscheZahl: google tells it's a thing
 AntiSquid: ah it's a twitch thing, really old too, people were pasting that to promote spam
 eulerscheZahl: still lagging jrke?
 jrke: yes
 dbdr: which browser are you using AntiSquid?
 dbdr: chat should not take much CPU
 eulerscheZahl: the Microsoft Internet Exploded
 eulerscheZahl: with the Adobe Crash Player plugin
 dbdr: euler in interesting form this morning :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's Caturday
 dbdr: it's deluge day here
 eulerscheZahl: as a metaphor or for real?
 dbdr: depends how literally you take it&#160;;)
 dbdr: it's been raining since yesterday evening. but no drowning yet
 eulerscheZahl: so no need to worry about you
 dbdr: check back in 40 days
 jrke: im reinstalling intellji now
 jrke: should i check add launchers to dir
 eulerscheZahl: too long ago, i don't remember if there were any specific steps needed
 eulerscheZahl: what was your problem with the previous installation?
 jrke: :thinking: don't know 
 eulerscheZahl: was there anything not working?
 jrke: after that it was not opening so i unistalled it now reinstalling it
 dbdr: seems some people have a huge database of coc code ready for copy-paste :D
 dbdr: are you making a contribution jrke?
 jrke: trying to make :smiley: but not now
 jrke: euler which type of project i have to choose
 jrke: maven,java ,java fx or any other
 dbdr: CG SDK uses maven
 jrke: oh
 jrke: its showing me no SDK on top left
 eulerscheZahl: can you elaborate on this a little more?
 eulerscheZahl: the codingame SDK? or something else missing?
 eulerscheZahl: did you import the maven project already?
 jrke: no when im clicking on new i choosed maven in that only on top left its showing me no SDK in intellji
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot?
 jrke: just a min
 ItsAFeature: Is it normal that I can delete someone else's comments on contributions?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, as soon as you reach lvl29
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dm-kTutV1S2XYxBMWO2kNaEL6Oxq0NTZ/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dm-kTutV1S2XYxBMWO2kNaEL6Oxq0NTZ/view?usp=sharing</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but don't abuse it ItsAFeature
 eulerscheZahl: i told you to create a project from existing sources
 ItsAFeature: I won't, I was just wondering.
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl 09:09AMeulerscheZahl 09:08AMeulerscheZahl 08:59AMfile -&gt; new -&gt; project from existing sources
 jrke: there is no option project from exsiting source
 eulerscheZahl: at the top menu?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/QMcDvgH">https://imgur.com/a/QMcDvgH</a>
 jrke: yeah
 jrke: so i have to open pom
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: as i wrote twice before
 eulerscheZahl: let me connect via teamviewer
 eulerscheZahl: too bad astro isn't here to laugh about it&#160;:(
 jrke: its showing error
 jrke: Tried to use preview panel provider (JavaFX WebView), but it is unavailable. Reverting to default.
 eulerscheZahl: so, does any project open?
 jrke: nope error
 eulerscheZahl: get your eclipse
 tomatoes: :grin:
 Xcalibre: is intellij necessary if i have vs code with the java extension pack?
 eulerscheZahl: you can build the whole thing from terminal if you want to
 eulerscheZahl: nothing is really necessary and can be replaced
 dbdr: no IDE is necessary, you can code with notepad and the JDK
 eulerscheZahl: notepad? take nano :D
 dbdr: or a magnetized needle, if you have a spinning disk
 eulerscheZahl: butterflies
 Xcalibre: look forward to trying it sometimes
 Xcalibre: how do i follow dbdr's method with an ssd?
 eulerscheZahl: hex editor
 tomatoes: sell and buy hdd
 eulerscheZahl: microwave it
 dbdr: I watched an interview of Brian Kernighan recently, and he mentioned the early editors
 dbdr: what's interesting is that in the early days you didn't have a screen, just a keyboard and a printer&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: wow
 dbdr: so the editor had to be powerful to make up for that
 dbdr: e.g. move to the Nth word of the line, which most modern editors don't allow you to do easily
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand: who needs that feature nowadays?
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl + arrowkey for fast moving is enough for me
 eulerscheZahl: and start/end of line
 dbdr: there is so much more
 dbdr: basically you have a scripting language designed to edit text in a very compact way
 dbdr: and composable
 dbdr: once you get the basics, there is no turning back
 eulerscheZahl: i guess a bit like i3wm. was tough at first but now i miss it everytime i have to use another system
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: or vim which i never learned&#160;:(
 dbdr: or terminal vs guis
 dbdr: I started vim 1 year ago
 dbdr: it's not too late and it's worth it, at  least for me
 eulerscheZahl: i failed at simple exercises like copy text to or from vim
 eulerscheZahl: was frustrated and gave up
 dbdr: it's hard at first for sure, and you need a good config
 dbdr: like I have it configed to use the system clipboard
 dbdr: which makes what you say easy
 hphadi: :poop:hi
 eulerscheZahl: did we lose jrke?
 jrke: gotta go will work on it later
 CoderAyoub: Morning all
 jacek: dbdr "I started vim 1 year ago" because you dont know how to exit vim
 dbdr: lol
 eulerscheZahl: :q!that's all i remember

 Marchete: vim, the worst UI ever
 eulerscheZahl: and Marchete saw the bender drafts
 Marchete: I mean, if people can't even close the program, I don't know how to do it worse
 Marchete: well, and tower defense too :D
 dbdr: Marchete: it's not for everyone&#160;;)
 Marchete: "it's not for everyone" excuses for a bad UI
 dbdr: it's like saying terminal is worse than GUI because it's harder for your grandma
 dbdr: it's not better or worse, it's for a different audience
 Marchete: there are plenty of terminal programs with a good UI
 eulerscheZahl: gvim
 dbdr: you're missing the point of the analogy
 Marchete: there is no analogy that users with MSDOS and linux console have problems with vim (like me)
 Marchete: anyways it was just a comment
 dbdr: GUI -&gt; Terminal (e.g. shell, nano, etc) -&gt; vim
 dbdr: it's one step further
 Marchete: GUI-&gt;shell-&gt;nano-&gt;hell-&gt;vim
 dbdr: that's pretty accurate actually :D
 eulerscheZahl: where is ed in that list?
 dbdr: I would not call it hell, but obviously it takes time to learn
 dbdr: ed is for when you don't have a screen&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i was always wondering what it's good for
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt">https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt</a>
 MSmits: finally won my 1st clash&#160;:)
 MSmits: little mathy one with concentrations
 dbdr: gg MSmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks
 Marchete: here :medal:
 dbdr: we should have a clash with only gurus allowed
 eulerscheZahl: the greatest WYGIWYG editor :D
 dbdr: such a strange sight on CG
 tomatoes: Newsgroups: alt.religion.emacs
 MSmits: i dont want to be slaughtered dbdr :P
 MSmits: let me just fight the noobs and win sometimes&#160;:)
 dbdr: tomatoes: that's a real one actually
 dbdr: I don't think most gurus are very good at clash
 MSmits: better than me I think
 dbdr: while there are lvl 10 people who have done thousands of them
 MSmits: you, robo and euler would beat me fast
 MSmits: sometimes I cant even solve them in 15 mins, happened once or twice
 MSmits: especially with reverse mode. I like it, but sometimes you just get on a wrong track
 dbdr: tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war#Humor">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war#Humor</a>
 MSmits: btw, i did fight a lot of those lvl 10 ones and it's why i am usually 2nd or 3rd. But it's less of a problem to lose to people you dont know&#160;:)
 dbdr: I see you're careful with your ego :D
 dbdr: did not expect that
 MSmits: yeah!
 tomatoes: i use vim, but only small configs tweaks
 eulerscheZahl: don't make yourself worse than you are MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: at pikaptcha i barely ranked higher than you
 MSmits: mmh in this case i'm not. It's just a matter of who you compare yourself with,
 MSmits: true, but thats not typical, you're usually twice as fast or around that
 MSmits: I'm ok at thinking of solutions fast. But it can be frustratingly slow in getting the code typed out. I  guess thats why clash might be good fo rme
 eulerscheZahl: so up next: smits gets into clashing and learns to code under pressure
 MSmits: right :P
 eulerscheZahl: also have a look into codeforces if you start to like it
 dbdr: tomatoes: any benefit in that case compared to nano?I think the benefits start to come when you use it often enough to learn things you can't do in other editors
 eulerscheZahl: that's 2.5h clashes with harder and original problems
 MSmits: nah, i dont think i will ever start to like it more than botting, but I like the fact that it makes me better and i learn some new tricks about python
 dbdr: yeah, python is a sweet spot, useful in clash AND for real, small tasks
 MSmits: also, what an easy cp rank boost :P
 blasterpoard: I gave up... just did my first clash as well
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: what happened blasterpoard?
 blasterpoard: won reverse in 2 minutes
 MSmits: ah ok, that seems more in the realm of expectation :P
 MSmits: you giving up not so much
 code_maniac: Ahh finally some guru showing interest in COC 🙈😜
 MSmits: it's the quest path
 code_maniac: guru's 😁
 MSmits: clicky xp things, can't resist
 blasterpoard: the hardest part was remembering sep="" in pyhton print
 dbdr: the challenge is to finish the path with exactly 50 clashes
 MSmits: not gonna happen in my case
 MSmits: but I'll get there
 MSmits: how many do you need to win to finish path?
 dbdr: 50
 MSmits: play 50 or win 50?
 dbdr: ah sorry, play 50
 MSmits: i was thinking, jeez that robo
 dbdr: and other requirements, like win 3 reverses
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and 3 wins in a row
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: thats gonna be a hard one
 dbdr: do 100% under 3 minutes twice
 dbdr: stuff like that
 dbdr: I don't know all of them
 MSmits: i got that one
 eulerscheZahl: i agree that playing 50 times is the hardest of those requirements
 eulerscheZahl: if you know some coding
 MSmits: haha not for me
 eulerscheZahl: for you too
 code_maniac: Solve COC in 3 different languages
 MSmits: i won my first after 14 clashes 
 MSmits: 3 in a row...
 Marchete: you are on fire!
 MSmits: no thats the task lol
 eulerscheZahl: you create a new clash and instantl start it as soon as the first player joins
 MSmits: ahh
 Marchete: I have 32/50 coc
 DomiKo: so sad, that i can't participate in challenge&#160;:(
 dbdr: hm, thanks Code_maniac, forgot about that one. got python and ruby for sure. probably need one more
 Marchete: and I don't think I'll do more
 MSmits: is ruby always shorter than python?
 dbdr: yeah, that's cheating. should be win with 8 players
 Marchete: perl and ruby usually yes
 Marchete: perl is like
 dbdr: probably not always
 Marchete: &lt;&gt;?!_
 code_maniac: Just know JS so need to learn basic syntax of other languages to do that 3 language one 
 Marchete: and you have doom
 Insufficient: my suggestion for 3 diff languages is to wait for a one liner clash which is much more easily translatable into another language
 eulerscheZahl: and you don't even have to win that one clash
 Insufficient: yeah
 dbdr: but often I think. python is just more useful outside of clash, so I'm not motivated to learn much ruby
 Marchete: I remember a hacker path on the quest map proposal
 Marchete: a pity they didn't added it
 eulerscheZahl: they will add more paths
 dbdr: it will come
 MSmits: yeah I think i did a codeacademy course once, on ruby, just to finish their list of free stuff
 eulerscheZahl: we made suggestions with to put on the path the other day
 eulerscheZahl: what, not with...
 eulerscheZahl: according to inoryy:python &gt; rubyruby on rails &gt; django
 MSmits: dont know what django is
 eulerscheZahl: i only know the python side of the equation
 eulerscheZahl: django = python web framework
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: my heroku app is in django
 MSmits: I see
 dbdr: ruby on rails &gt; ruby&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: what makes it "on rails "&#160;?
 MSmits: are they safety rails?
 eulerscheZahl: also for web dev
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen a few references to ruby on rails in the django docs

 AntiSquid: only 50% NivethSaran
 AntiSquid: what are you trying to tell us?
 NivethSaran: I am sorry, I shared the link here before the clash started accidentally
 bruddah: hey everyone! i am new here and i have a question. can i see the questions that i solve before (the actaul question)
 eulerscheZahl: are you talking about clash of code? no, that's the whole point of it
 eulerscheZahl: but some players clash a lot and there's a limited pool of tasks to choose from
 bruddah: thanks. i am having hard time to solve those questions&#160;:(. i thought i could  solve those later
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>you can search them here
 eulerscheZahl: if you remember 1 or 2 words from the statement
 bruddah: ahhaa found it thank you!
 dbdr: nice UI&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: another user gave me some stylesheet :D
 eulerscheZahl: damn, Thor goes north now
 JBM: the horror
 dbdr: is Thor in the quests?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 DinuBrat: Wow u are 1st)))
 dbdr: we are in the alternate reality where gurus clash and euler golfs :D
 eulerscheZahl: let's have both at once then :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1308848b91895627ab37a101492c9bf45ea8a7d">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1308848b91895627ab37a101492c9bf45ea8a7d</a>
 eulerscheZahl: private clash, unrated
 dbdr: both what?
 eulerscheZahl: guru clash + euler clash
 eulerscheZahl: start or wait?
 dbdr: you're a guru
 JBM: damn i'm not guru anymore
 dbdr: but I said golf
 eulerscheZahl: you may still join if you want
 JBM: too bad that would have been quite the experience
 dbdr: join in JBM
 JBM: errr
 dbdr: exguru counts
 JBM: got my hands full right now&#160;:(
 dbdr: ex #1 at clash
 JBM: ok, would be ready now but i sppose you started already
 eulerscheZahl: yes, shortest
 eulerscheZahl: not a fun one though
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e7e9e31-97a4-48e6-b437-7cda70f17075">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e7e9e31-97a4-48e6-b437-7cda70f17075</a>
 dbdr: working code&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 53 atm
 dbdr: 55
 dbdr: 53
 blasterpoard: 59&#160;:(
 dbdr: there is time
 wlesavo: 55, hm
 dbdr: 52
 eulerscheZahl: you just lost dbdr
 dbdr: took a gamble that no one will do 51&#160;:)
 dbdr: and lost, maybe, fair enough
 RoboStac: here, have a 48
 eulerscheZahl: 46
 dbdr: ah, ruby
 RoboStac:&#160;:(
 dbdr: of course
 eulerscheZahl: yes, ruby
 dbdr: I don't think 51 is possible in python, but who knows
 dbdr: at least in this format
 eulerscheZahl: now i want to see your 52 python
 dbdr: shared

 RoboStac: oh wow didn't know about puts doing newlines for ,
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i had the same except for the print statement
 eulerscheZahl: me neither, enough time to google
 dbdr: yeah, pretty simple task, not much to work with
 RoboStac: could have done 41&#160;:(
 ad99526: hey whatsup
 AmarjitSingh: heyy
 ad99526: aur lode
 AmarjitSingh: I m from the future
 blasterpoard: i keep losing shortest even to random people, because I don't know these languages properly...
 dbdr: just read the tips on golfing
 dbdr: I don't know the languages either
 AmarjitSingh: Is this the first year of covid
 RoboStac: I only know ruby from googling during golf the other day
 eulerscheZahl: puts [do you even need that space?
 dbdr: did JBM join after it was started? :D
 wlesavo: well ill take my not last with 54 and check the dbdr solution =)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm wondering the same :D
 dbdr: share yours wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: with python i'm down to 53
 wlesavo: damn, f strings xD
 dbdr: yeah, I had 53 without f'
 blasterpoard: I just learned that they exist
 eulerscheZahl: and JBM about to beat all of us with bash
 dbdr: or perl
 dbdr: oh wait, this wasn't fastest? /s
 eulerscheZahl: perl, 46 chars
 dbdr: gg euler
 JBM: short on time
 JBM: (I started with ~12' remaining)
 eulerscheZahl: my python:
 eulerscheZahl: a=input()s='*'*(len(a)+4)print(s+'\n* '+a+' *\n'+s)
 JBM: pretty sure that thing can be optimised more
 dbdr: it always can&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: except if it can't
 wlesavo: reversing a string gave me one char
 dbdr: it can as long as you don't know it's impossible
 JBM: gimme 2'
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what this perl does, even knowing the task :D
 dbdr: sometimes you just need to modify the language and wait for CG to upgrade
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/130886765eeea5a70680be27cb596cb2c65e02e">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/130886765eeea5a70680be27cb596cb2c65e02e</a>last one for me, mode is random
 JBM: there was no \n in input, right?
 eulerscheZahl: don't know
 dbdr: why am I doing this, I should do real clashes :D
 JBM: if so i have 42
 JBM: confirmed from the contrib page: there's no \n in input and I have 42 in perl
 eulerscheZahl: and that's how we lost JBM on the 2nd clash
 JBM: hey i can't spend all day clashing
 JBM: especially in random mode :p
 eulerscheZahl: neither can I. pizza later today&#160;:)
 JBM: i had pizza yesterday evening and this noon
 JBM: i don't want to hear about pizza ever again
 JBM: for the next two days
 wlesavo: hm, forgot how replace works in python :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 blasterpoard: I didn't understand what did it want from me
 dbdr: me neither, too hard for me :D
 eulerscheZahl: find the most common word
 RoboStac: most common word unless there were multiple with the same frequency
 eulerscheZahl: or NOT FOUND if not unique
 eulerscheZahl: a little unfair: saw it in pending contributions. so i knew what it was asking for
 dbdr: hum, I had that idea but saw exceptions to it
 dbdr: probably I saw wrongly
 blasterpoard: I was wondering if it wants me to find pronouns or shortest word in some part of the sentence
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't 100% sure either anymore. just coded it to see
 blasterpoard: "you", "us", "all" was kinda misleading
 wlesavo: hm, i thought it was smallest of the repeating words, lol
 dbdr: by definition reverse is ambiguous
 dbdr: there can be multiple rules that fit the examples
 JBM: damn you C
 MSmits: there can be multiple rules, that, when applied also fit the validators 
 MSmits: in that case there is no problem
 wlesavo: also 4 test cases for reverse is kinda low
 dbdr: sure,  but you don't know the validators
 JBM: my bug from late night personal coding is that i wrote O_WRONLY, O_CREAT instead of O_WRONLY | O_CREAT
 dbdr: fix your compiler
 JBM: of course C wouldn't tell my anything about me providing too many arguments to that prototyped function
 MSmits: nope, but you dont have to. If all sets of rules that fit the test cases, also fit the validators, you dont need to know which was the intended set
 dbdr: but it's never like that
 MSmits: probably not
 JBM: should've written it in rust
 blasterpoard: are the next "achievements" as time-consuming as play 50*CoC?
 dbdr: you can always create rule 1 and rule 2, that both fit the testcases, not only 1 first the validators
 RoboStac: blasterpoard - no
 dbdr: unless validators == testcases&#160;:)
 RoboStac: once I'd got 50 I had to play 1 more coc to get all of them
 MSmits: i played 2 games vs blasterpoard earlier today
 RoboStac: and that was only because I'd not done something in the 50
 eulerscheZahl: others are top 1k, win 3 in a row and such
 MSmits: first time I felt I was super fast with 2 minutes and he did it in 1 min
 MSmits: second time he had an awesome short solution i am stealing
 eulerscheZahl: and you have to use 3 different languages *spoiler*
 blasterpoard: i dont remember those tbh
 MSmits: I do :P
 RoboStac: are you planning to play enough clashes that stealing solutions is useful? :o
 blasterpoard: but I know I played against you
 MSmits: RoboStac not really, but I am recording them anyway
 MSmits: you never know&#160;:)
 RoboStac: though I guess stealing ideas is useful
 MSmits: its also useful for code golf
 MSmits: just the general tricks
 blasterpoard: what was that short solution? I don't think my golfing is awesome
 MSmits: lemme check
 eulerscheZahl: and then we'll find the task again and golf it better
 MSmits: want me to paste it here blasterpoard?
 MSmits: it's your code
 blasterpoard: either here, or PM
 blasterpoard: i dont care
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: here
 MSmits: n=100/int(input())l=input().split()print(sum([int(i) for i in set(l) if int(i)==n*l.count(i)]))
 MSmits: counting probabilities
 blasterpoard: yes, I remembered
 dbdr: not optimal
 MSmits: turning it into a set is pretty cool
 blasterpoard: it's not ruby
 MSmits: dbdr what can be improved?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/734d3b79b09e5e32e164c84a51b329d0e65">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/734d3b79b09e5e32e164c84a51b329d0e65</a> this one?
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: I didn't say I knew what could be improved&#160;;)
 RoboStac: square brackets for list comprehension aren't needed
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: that's the sort of fancy stuff I see euler do in C# with linq
 MSmits: I don't know many of those tricks
 MSmits: too bad C# is too wordy for shortest
 MSmits: but you can use it on code golf
 dbdr: problem with C# is system call is shorter&#160;:(
 MSmits: what do you mean exactly?
 eulerscheZahl: call bash
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: you might as well just pick bash then?
 eulerscheZahl: my C# are real C# golf solutions. and i perform poorly
 dbdr: I did a good one in Thor, d-s-x beat it by 50  chars, probably in 5 minutes
 dbdr: no ethics
 eulerscheZahl: i blame CG here. if it can be abused, someone will
 dbdr: I agree
 JBM: he's ready for facebook then?
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: I just saw a vid on choosing an thical OS, on this topic&#160;:)
 dbdr: *ethical
 eulerscheZahl: swagcoloredkitteh can talk about this a lot
 MSmits: does it give you a fatal error when you try to download torrents?
 eulerscheZahl: how he only installs free software
 JBM: download? torrents are *shared*
 MSmits: sure, downloaded and uploaded :P
 MSmits: semantics
 dbdr: and many torrents are legal
 JBM: spread the love
 MSmits: many yes 
 MSmits: ethics and legality isn't the same thing btw
 dbdr: indeed
 MSmits: I downloaded a lot of illegal stuff when I was young. Games and such
 MSmits: no more though
 JBM: noy you only upload it?
 MSmits: you mean give it back? :O
 dbdr: yeah, just upload it enough to compensate&#160;:)
 MSmits: I've always found it funny how they equated it to stealing when it's really not the same thing
 dbdr: that's ethical btw
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4</a>
 MSmits: i mean, it's only stealing if you could have paid for it. I downloaded a lot more than I could have afforded to buy :P
 MSmits: nice video&#160;:)

 JBM: did you copy my url?
 dbdr: nope, was searching it too
 JBM: searching is stealing
 eulerscheZahl: it crowd, i'll happily watch it twice
 dbdr: yes, copying all those unique bits
 MSmits: nice
 JBM: there's gotta be a best of somewhere
 JBM: like the "don't search for google on google"
 eulerscheZahl: this, Jen, is the internet
 dbdr: yeah, most of it is good. season 2 is a bit weaker IIRC
 JBM: oh, that one too&#160;:)
 MSmits: do you break the internet through infinite recursion when you search google on google?
 JBM: the emergency number
 dbdr: yes, MSmits. please don't try it
 eulerscheZahl: 0118999881999119725 3
 MSmits: kk
 eulerscheZahl: gtg, see you tomorrow
 dbdr: who's singing now?
 JBM: have a nice pizza

 AntiSquid: what's that about&#160;?
 Laminator: ruby for shortest
 Laminator: for sure. I think python is fine for fastest
 jacek: meow
 tomatoes: play 50 clashes :cold_sweat:
 Gortax: any language with weak types that you're comfortable with is good for fastest imo
 code_maniac: JS is fun, python is also pretty good
 Laminator: python does not have weak types lol
 tomatoes: it has some "tricks"
 tomatoes: sum of bool list
 Laminator: I'm usually building my list from scratch so I haven't done much with bool lists 
 tomatoes: just example of implicit conversion
 jjhiggz: I love that this encourages you to skip around languages so you start to pick out what you don't like and like about each language
 jjhiggz: I learned ruby in bootcamp and was kind of pissed I didn't learn python because thats what all the cool kids know. But now I choose Ruby over python for the short code challenges because I love enumerables
 freshskates: i code in c++, kinda new, is python really that much better?
 delta_computer: python is a scripting language so it will usally be faster to make a working program with it

 alisolanki: how to print the pascals triangle in the shortest way possible
 itzblinkzy: language?
 itzblinkzy: UnRandom are you able to share your code please?
 itzblinkzy: or Yes1
 itzblinkzy: I'm trying to learn :pensive:
 Laminator: pascals triangle tells you the number of combinations given a list and the size of the group
 Laminator: so like row 5 of pascals triangle tells you the number for 5 choose 0, 5 choose 1,..., 5 choose 5. 
 Laminator: there is a formula to calculation combinations
 RShields: looking at the triangle, realize that each number is the sum of the two above it. Write that.

 pedrosorio: thanks for the invite @andreza.bona
 pedrosorio: @Allis is still fun to do clash of code after more than 1500? Don't you see the same problems often?
 Allis: @pedrosorio Certainly not as fun as it was in the beginning, but I still get a kick out of it. You're probably right that I should stop, though. :sweat_smile:

 abt8601: At your level you can already solve easy puzzles. You can learn DS and algorithms as you move on to medium puzzles.

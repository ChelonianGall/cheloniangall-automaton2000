 aCat: randomly changing parameters ;p
 struct: ok im going to try that
 struct: What can go wrong
 struct: you meant change and insta submit?
 aCat: be warned - when I say randomly its not random
 aCat: just all the japanese I was losing to with these params tested before are already in legend ;p
 struct: maybe it can beat the boss
 aCat: i hope....
 struct: it was a good start
 aCat: otherwise -  we need someone from low gold
 aCat: constantly submitting - and maybe we will get hist first game
 struct: I won 2 games and lost 0.01 points
 struct: logic
 emh: tie against aCat
 struct: was before
 emh: for me
 struct: ah :p
 emh: look at me I'm a submissive slave submitting all the time
 emh: I should wear my submittance mittens
 struct: me rank 121 on cg, acat rank 120
 emh: I was below 100 once ranked as guru but now I'm 138
 struct: nice this is my lowest rank
 struct: or highest 
 emh: alas the world never stops revolving and the cg points are not forever golden
 struct: im so tired
 struct: i dont even know what to do anymore
 HenroLST: does anyone know how to check run time?

 HenroLST: thanks
 pedrosorio: question: does anyone know how to debug "has not provided an action in time" in C++?
 Machetti: sounds like an infinite loop?
 pedrosorio: For some reason it's failing on a turn when I do:cout &lt;&lt; "WAIT" &lt;&lt; endl; 
 pedrosorio: the game recognizes this was printed in stdout (according to my measurement ~0.04s after I read the first input)
 pedrosorio: but still says the action was not provided in time
 pedrosorio: screenshot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/B9bkxvE">https://imgur.com/a/B9bkxvE</a>
 pedrosorio: printing RANDOM has the same result hmm
 struct: is this just while reading inputs?
 pedrosorio: struct what do you mean?

 struct: my code is unreadable 
 lifetimeLearner007: CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION 6After this, I still see the card6 is getting pushed to discard pile at the end of my turn. Isn't it supposed to stay in hand until I release an app?
 lifetimeLearner007: Also, "Replay in same conditions" doesn't ensure the same cardsInHand at the start of the game
 struct: the 1st one is just porly worded I guess
 struct: the 2nd one should start the game with same cards in hand
 struct: aCat leave it to me I'll handle it

 aCat: you can do something?

 aCat: i know i watched the stats previously
 eulerscheZahl: now i really want to submit
 emh: good night
 pedrosorio: Does anyone else have any ideas on how to debug a "has not provided an action in time" error for C++ code? A bit late in the contest, but just trying to get any submission to work :P
 Westicles: timing out?
 jacek: probably crashing
 pedrosorio: (fails in PLAY_CARD phase - MOVE works fine - I print "RANDOM" immediately after reading the input for the PLAY_CARD phase)
 yanamal: Make sure you're only printing out exactly the things  it expects. i think sometimes it tells me that when I accidentally print debug output to standard stream
 pedrosorio: the judge acknowledges the RANDOM in the Standard Output Stream
 pedrosorio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/WAxXMYv">https://imgur.com/a/WAxXMYv</a>
 yanamal: great, but are there *other* things in tthe standard output stream
 pedrosorio: I'm looking at the online IDE
 pedrosorio: only see a line with RANDOM
 pedrosorio: (see screenshot above)
 eulerscheZahl: julien still coding games. just not for bots this time<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpREhzsV6F0&amp;ab_channel=CodinGame">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpREhzsV6F0&amp;ab_channel=CodinGame</a>
 yanamal: maybe it accepted your RANDOM for something else and is expecting the next input for the play card phase
 pedrosorio: yanamal it accepted MOVE 3 for the previous phase
 yanamal: depending on context that's not in your screenshot, it could be any number of input/output mismatches. an unexpected extra phase, or not reading all expected input before printing output, or extra output.
 Westicles: just keep in mind WAIT is not always a valid move
 pedrosorio: it's the second phase in the game (and fails there every time), I stderr the possible moves, so I believe I am reading the whole input correctly
 Westicles: could this be the first US victory in CG history?
 jacek: :rage:
 Westicles: or our #1 ally Poland...
 Westicles: my money is on Japan
 aCat: no chance for us

 ArianPunk: its last test case, expects Nothing while it actually expects an output.
 darkhorse64: nope, "PAT" is expected
 ArianPunk: you didn't read my text carefully.
 darkhorse64: I solved the puzzle carefully
 ArianPunk: dumbass, i know it expects PAT, and i print it , but it says it must be Nothing
 ArianPunk: it expects me Nothing
 ArianPunk: now do u understand??
 struct: chill
 DaNinja: happens sometimes when you output too many lines
 darkhorse64: The puzzle is OK, your code is not. Check your outputs
 struct: maybe you printed extra space or an extra \n
 Westicles: it expected nothing and you printed something, got it?
 ArianPunk: ok

 TimeEngineer: It was so close all time
 struct: Legend this time was pretty hard
 struct: The game rng didn't help
 jacek: :smirk:
 DomiKo: rng helped me :D 
 TimeEngineer: Reached 3 times 1st and can't get legend because jacek's boss elo was too high&#160;:(

 MSmits: ohh I am 43! That seems a lot better than what I've seen on the ladder this last day
 MSmits: I guess some people have been submitting that are strong against my bot
 MSmits: (relatively)
 therealbeef: had a bad last minute submit&#160;:(
 MSmits: ahh sucks&#160;:(
 Nerchio: yep don't do last minute submits in a random game
 putibuzu: :D
 therealbeef: offline it had a 53% winrate against previous, but the server doesn't agree
 putibuzu: same here, was #6 in gold, now 83 :sweat_smile:
 jacek: there is not gold recalc :thinking:
 putibuzu: hard to overstate the volatility of this game
 MSmits: most contests are like this though
 MSmits: (volatile leaderboards)
 MSmits: the only way to beat it is to be a lot better than anyone else
 putibuzu: yes, which my bot clearly wasn't :D
 putibuzu: but still had a lot of fun, thanks everyone!&#160;:)

 MSmits: well knowing the rules didnt help me much either :P
 ArianPunk: I just submitted a puzzle earning 100%, yet no achievements unlocked, they must have been, though. Is this a bug
 5DN1L: which puzzle? ArianPunk
 ArianPunk: winamax-battle
 5DN1L: You mean this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/winamax-battle">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/winamax-battle</a>
 ArianPunk: yeah
 fathidevs: fastest mode is also the "largest most boring description mod" 
 fathidevs: i like reverse mode
 5DN1L: ArianPunk try submitting your code again, if the achievement still doesn't show up after a day, report it as a bug on discord or on the forum
 ArianPunk: shouldn't i just wait for a day or do i have to submit again?
 5DN1L: you can do either
 ArianPunk: Isn't it because the App thinks my code has syntax error?
 jacek: does it?
 ArianPunk: it's showing me a syntax error, although it's not wrong.
 5DN1L: what syntax error
 ArianPunk: in Rust you can print like:println!("{a_variable}");
 ArianPunk: as well as: println!("{}", a_variable);
 Prownie: Hey Jacek, my question might sounds stupid (kinda new to this, but how did you train your model, i mean how did you share data between trainings&#160;?
 j4at: jacek you should definitly share your nn architecture&#160;:)
 j4at: (with me atleast)
 Prownie: Dunno if question makes any sense ahah
 ArianPunk: I'm using the former and it's showing me the error..
 jacek: Prownie hmm, can you rephrase the question? ^^
 jacek: j4at I replied
 5DN1L: ArianPunk is it supported all along or is it a new syntax in a new version?
 ArianPunk: I reckon it's new.
 5DN1L: CG's rust version is 1.60.0
 ArianPunk: I think it's up to date.
 ArianPunk: let me re-submit again then.
 jacek: Prownie i just save the model every 1000 or so. model is just array of floats, so I can use them in CG
 j4at: MLP&#160;:(
 ArianPunk: One more thing
 jacek: RNN could work better with hidden information, but i'm too dumb for that yet
 Prownie: Was trying to rephrase ahah, but thank for you reply, totally makes sense&#160;!
 j4at: yeah training RNN with dqn is tricky
 ArianPunk: do i have to play all testcases before submitting?
 5DN1L: no
 jacek: no need
 ArianPunk: tried with the other syntax, no chance.
 ArianPunk: I've had this same issue the other day.
 _Royale: jacek: just read your PM, wow! congrats&#160;:)
 j4at: jacek how did you compile the referee? I gave up because I had to write a simulation&#160;:(
 j4at: is github down&#160;?
 jacek: i opened in idea. but i actually copied most game core stuff into new project, without viewer and stuff.
 Psyho: how do people add DL inference code to their submissions? I assume that everyone is using pytorch/tensorflow these days
 jacek: they make their own
 jacek: its just matrix multiplication and dot product
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 DomiKo: you can check this out
 darkhorse64: DomiKo will you write a PM&#160;? I wanna know about your MC stuff
 DomiKo: Psyho should write one :sweat_smile:
 darkhorse64: Both of you 
 Psyho: I can take screenshots from chat
 Psyho: a bit sad that I didn't have time to do anything more&#160;:/
 DomiKo: I'm wondering how exactly did you make random simulations work. I had so much trouble with creating 5th app
 Psyho: you mean that the rollouts were not representative?
 DomiKo: were too random, I couldn't make a good pruning 
 Psyho: confused what do you mean by "pruning" here
 Psyho: I just have a heuristic that evaluates every move (+ adds random component so it's not deterministic)
 aCat: Yeah I had similar approach
 aCat: so thanks for the idea Psyho&#160;:-)
 aCat: just heuristic bot used as rollout policy
 Psyho: you want your rollouts to be quite random, otherwise you'll always bias your decision in the same way
 Psyho: aCat, yeah same - just converted my heuristic bot to rollout policy as well
 aCat: but nondeterministic so at every phase it tries to return a list of moves
 OldJohn: jacek did you consider having different NN for each phases of the play. Move/Give/Throw/Play/Release&#160;?
 derjack: no. phases were encoded as one-hot input
 OldJohn: Yes of course, but it may help to have 5 different NN or not&#160;?
 derjack: i havent tested that. but that would make 5x more size, or 5x each smaller net
 OldJohn: yes, you have less output also (eg for the move phase) so NN will be of different size and you can vary the hidden state size also
 OldJohn: I suggest GIVE/THROW can be the same NN.
 wlesavo: and the input will be a bit smaller since there wont be phases
 BrunoFelthes: how can jacek upload 82k weights if the max code size is 100k bytes?
 derjack: i trained bigger model at last day, it plateau near at the same time as smaller model. i wonder if this was limitation of my learning framework. should i give more replay buffer, more games etc.
 derjack: utf-16 unicode is treated as 1 char. you can do 1 lower precision weight per character
 OldJohn: And how comes derjack answer for jacek&#160;?
 derjack: :no_mouth:
 wlesavo: derjacek
 jzen: Dr. Jacek rather
 BrunoFelthes: WoW, jacek code probably looks like a mess
 derjack: techinal debts ech
 Westicles: anyone go on twitter or whatever and find out what the japanese guys did?
 derjack: imcts apparently
 kovi: in this game models are interdependent (move considers release), so single nn makes sense
 OldJohn: IMCTS&#160;? what is the I for&#160;? Incremental&#160;?
 BrunoFelthes: Westicles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/bowwowforeach/status/1541344805779030016">https://twitter.com/bowwowforeach/status/1541344805779030016</a>
 derjack: or was it ISMCTS? generally mcts for random and hidden information games
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/75048/1/CowlingPowleyWhitehouse2012.pdf">https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/75048/1/CowlingPowleyWhitehouse2012.pdf</a>
 OldJohn: OK I'll take a look... More interesting that the review of ITER plasma control by RL I have to summarize here&#160;:-)
 MSmits: derjack did you use the playsleft, last move and last desk (from earlier phases) as input. They were not given so you had to have kept track of it yourself
 Westicles: Yeah, and I'm back to winding my Rogowski coil
 derjack: MSmits no, i got only what referee gave me
 MSmits: oh might have been a missed opportunity. It's important to know if you can play 1 or 2 cards and where your bot is going. Still though, quite an achievement
 Psyho: oldjohn: in general, it's never good to have separate models for different outputs
 Psyho: if that's the case that means your model architecture sucks
 MSmits: derjack also: I suspect your bot would be a lot stronger, like it is in other boardgames, if you had searched your own turn more and then used an eval
 MSmits: my bot could almost always fully search, if it had your eval...
 MSmits: (my eval was slow too, so...)
 derjack: i somehow wasnt motivated to write sim at all
 MSmits: yeah i thought so
 derjack: id probably use td-gammon approach then
 MSmits: oh, i am actually more motivated to try back gammon now that I did a probability search for this one
 kovi: yeah, previous phase, picked item and maybe turn# is important (quasi-input state variables)
 kovi: (picked=willbepicked)
 MSmits: OldJohn thanks for the name of that function&#160;:)
 MSmits: CG emailed me your reply lol
 OldJohn: @psyho Well, it depends I can say... In real world, here, a NN for each task is better than a NN for all tasks even if they are related. Sorry I can say more&#160;:-)
 darkhorse64: I browse tesauro papers on backgammon, maybe I am wrong but did not this guy invented alpha zero twenty years before the papers&#160;?
 derjack: i think hes mentioned in a0 papers
 Psyho: oldjohn: but those are not different tasks, they share the same state
 Psyho: you're losing a ton of information
 OldJohn: darkhorse64 Not really alpha zero but use of RL in games yes.. Terry made a good work
 MSmits: derjack seems like _Royale did your way with a sim. He kind of puts it in a one liner at the end. Like... oh and I used a NN for eval...
 Psyho: especially considering you're highly limited on model size (source code lmit)
 OldJohn: Psyho yes here, you have a limitation on size sure not in real lige
 OldJohn: life&#160;:-)
 derjack: well all can be tested once the game will be multiplayer
 MSmits: yeah, this seems like a great example of a game to use NN on
 derjack: probably a small tweak in some hyperparameter could win me a phone
 OldJohn: Of course, it will... First if I have time I'll try to replicate your result
 MSmits: derjack this is why I never returned to an excontest yet. I am always afraid I'll find a small thing that could have improved my result a lot
 derjack: there were some instabilities though. i.e. a winrate against random bot could drop to 30%, will against stronger bots would still be 70+% and i dont know why\
 MSmits: the entire leaderboard was unstable&#160;:)
 MSmits: so might not just be your bot
 derjack: euler said he still was losing 5% to random
 MSmits: yeah in a normal game this is 0%
 derjack: or 0.00001%. random could still be perfect
 MSmits: the drawing of cards combined with relatively few choices in a game makes this happen
 MSmits: btw strangely enough calculating the probability of drawing a certain cardset without doing unnecessarily calculation is very similar to calculating an index function for an oware board (for endgame book)
 MSmits: the only  real difference is dividing by total possibility count to get a probability
 MSmits: i guess it's related to permutations and all that. I don't know the lingo
 MSmits: (this is the problem when you figure stuff out yourself, you don't know what it's called)
 MSmits: I am mostly going by half remembered probability classes in highschool 25 years ago
 Crosility: I feel ya MSmits - I'm self taught on most things. Even stuff I'm professionally certified in. And I stumble on some basic lingo. It's a problem.
 MSmits: yea
 Crosility: Probability equations have too many specific cases
 MSmits: I have a good intuitive feel for the math of this, but as soon as they start to formalize it with certain notations, it stops making sense to me
 Crosility: Like the delta, omega.. etc notation?
 Westicles: yeah, I think I rediscovered Stirling numbers doing my roulette puzzle
 MSmits: dont even know what that is Crosility
 OldJohn: Delta, omicron, BA2
 Crosility: Lmao.
 Crosility: Delta, usually "change" delta with dot, "rate of change"
 MSmits: ohh, no I am a physicist. So no problem there. I am mostly talking about probability notations
 MSmits: like when they put paranthesis with 2 numbers above eachother, whatever that is
 MSmits: maybe that's the falling factorial OldJohn was talking about
 Westicles: nchoosek
 MSmits: n choose k yeah i guess
 MSmits: the notations obfuscate it fo rme
 Crosility: I thought that was geometry/graph theory.
 MSmits: it is? I guess a lot of this stuff is related too..
 MSmits: i never formally learned graph stuff either and i did a lot with graphs on CG
 Crosility: I never, and still haven't learned it. Though they tried to teach me in HS. I'm good at math, but that's weirdly abstract.
 Crosility: And now thats over a decade ago...
 MSmits: graph stuff becomes a lot less abstract when you need it to write a bot for a game
 MSmits: everything immediately has an example
 Crosility: I wonder if I've been doing it all this time, but never realized it, with the 2d arrays and struct arrays? O.o
 MSmits: well even if you have a 2D map with cells and connections, it is already a graph
 Crosility: True. Haha.. just never used their calculator "functions" to operate on it.
 MSmits: maybe the ones you write yourself, do the same thing
 derjack: i came up with many graphs stuff myself to only learn later there are names for them
 MSmits: yeah thats it exactly derjack
 Crosility: google.com &gt; "How to ..."
 MSmits: some tasks are too complex to turn into a google query
 Crosility: Blasphemy.
 MSmits: well assuming you lack the lingo, which we established that we do&#160;:)
 Crosility: Well, yeah, okay - sometimes the lingo search is required for the actual search.
 Crosility: You got me.
 Crosility: Just gotta do some rabbit-hole searching.
 Crosility: And maybe a couple youtube videos.
 MSmits: but yeah sometimes i am surprised some poorly worded search still comes up with a useful Stack overflow post
 Crosility: Time to learn hashtables.
 Westicles: it is a shame you can't google code snippets
 Crosility: Another odd concept. I bet-and can tell-hella useful. BUT, the collision conditions frighten me. Lol
 Westicles: impossible to learn perl via search
 MSmits: Crosility a hash-table can be really simple if you don't mind overwriting on collisions
 MSmits: depends on what you want to use it for
 MSmits: if for a search for a boardgame or so, overwriting a result is np
 Crosility: Westicles --&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.perltutorial.org/">https://www.perltutorial.org/</a> .. are normal tutorials not good enough for it? Or is perl too hard? I'm a C guy.. sooo..
 MSmits: you just have to re-search an overwritten result if you need it again
 Crosility: Well, like doing puzzle MIME type. And my research to implementing a good hash table is by making the table, then treat conditions as linked lists.
 Crosility: collisions*
 Westicles: Crosility, you'll see some crazy code golf thing in perl so you want to google a 5 character string of punctuation to see it used, but all that gets stripped out
 Crosility: Aww actual used-code case.
 Westicles: also impossible to learn bash, you have to be a 75 year old french guy that just knows it from working
 Westicles: bash golf that is
 Crosility: I went against Whale yesterday is CoC, and that guys python code is unreadable to me.
 Crosility: So I get where you're coming from.
 Crosility: He's ranked 6 on CoC leaderboard. A problem that took me nested for loops and 14 minutes to solve, he did in like 12 lines of code, in under 2 minutes.
 Westicles: he's probably a 75 year old french guy who has spent the last 50 years writing python functions in assembly
 _Royale: MSmits: haha sorry if I sounded casual about the NN eval&#160;:) unlike derjack I only had a one output value evaluation, I did not train a policy and relied on a exhaustive search like you did.
 MSmits: yeah _Royale thats what i was saying to jace k, maybe if he combined his search with mine it would have been better. That's exactly what yours was
 MSmits: I think it's kind of cool though, to go in completely blind to the sim and just let the NN do everything
 Astrobytes: *yawn* morning all, nice placement Royale, grats&#160;:)
 MSmits: morning Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: did struc t or a cat reach legend?
 MSmits: not sure
 darkhorse64: a cat at the very last minute
 Astrobytes: was close at 04.30 when I went to bed
 Astrobytes: ah thx darkhorse
 derjack: and struct delete his account?
 derjack: nope, still there
 Astrobytes: No, I wouldn't expect so. Catching up on some sleep I imagine
 _Royale: yeah jacek approach is super nice, and I like how the referee complexity was an extra motivation :D
 derjack: next time NN will model the game based on code
 dude_guy: hello fellow humans 
 MSmits: you sound like a bot pretending to be human :P
 MSmits: :robot:
 dude_guy: you sound like a bitch
 Astrobytes: that escalated quickly
 dude_guy: iam sorry
 Astrobytes: does he look like one?
 dude_guy: playing the mars lander game 
 Aldoggen: which one? 
 MSmits: dude_guy I will take this as a compliment. My dog is female and I think she is a great person.
 dude_guy: dogs are great
 MSmits: indeed
 dude_guy: what type of dog she is 
 Astrobytes: and everyone missed my Samuel L. Jackson moment
 MSmits: hard to say, close to a tibetan spaniel i think, small dog, very good guard dog
 MSmits: sorry did not get the reference Astrobytes
 dude_guy: i dont trust small dogs sorry 
 dude_guy: demon spawns 
 MSmits: very wise
 Astrobytes: He called you a b*tch, I asked if you looked like one, I hoped he would take the bait and go full Pulp Fiction
 MSmits: oh ok, i dont think i ever saw the full movie
 Astrobytes: You should, it's great.
 dude_guy: we can redo it if u want 
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: Nice elegant calculations btw MSmits
 MSmits: thanks&#160;!
 Astrobytes: lol dude_guy, nah, I think the moment has passed
 dude_guy: well shit next time 
 derjack: oO
 Aldoggen: make sure you're on the toilet first
 MSmits: good advice
 MSmits: also check for toilet paper
 Aldoggen: we're still acting like dude_guy is a bot lol
 dude_guy: i cant believe u westerners got away with using toilet paper 
 derjack: isnt he Automaton2000 brother
 Automaton2000: so you can't see the animation panel??
 MSmits: dude_guy it's better to use the moist paper, it's cleaner
 dude_guy: cutting down million of tress 
 dude_guy: how about get a soap and water and do it like asia does it 
 MSmits: uses more water
 Aldoggen: one day I'll calculate if it's cost efficient
 5DN1L: let's end the discussion of toilet paper here, shall we?
 Aldoggen: if it's on the same order of magnitude I'll try to switch to a bidet lol
 dude_guy: yeah that is better
 Astrobytes: Flush the chat?
 Aldoggen: f
 Aldoggen: l
 Aldoggen: u
 MSmits: lol
 Aldoggen: well, I'm not trying that again
 Crosility: t..t...timeout
 Astrobytes: afternoon 5DN1L&#160;:)
 5DN1L: afternoon Astrobytes, MSmits&#160;:)
 derjack: :upside_down:
 5DN1L: and derjack&#160;:)
 MSmits: hi 5DN1L. I thought it was just sex,politics and religion on the list of topics. Should add toiletpaper if it's not a suitable topic
 MSmits: would be fun to build up a list of these over time :P
 5DN1L: lol
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: derjack: nice work in the contest man, that was an impressive feat
 derjack: :blush:
 dude_guy: yo dudes can u get the mars lander in EP1 to land before one minute 
 MSmits: if the speed goes over 40, use the thrust, otherwise fall
 MSmits: should be ok
 dude_guy: i tried 
 MSmits: what happens?
 dude_guy: cant go below 1M 4 secs 
 dude_guy: 1minute 4secs
 MSmits: oh there is another way
 dude_guy: iam listening 
 MSmits: calculate how many turns it takes to brake to below 40 speed and calculate how many turns it takes to hit the ground
 MSmits: if it takes more turns to hit the ground, keep falling
 MSmits: if it takes more turns to brake, use thrust (or a little sooner than this)
 dude_guy: will try math man 
 MSmits: yeah, thats really the fastest you can go
 Aldoggen: remember that the thrust only changes by 1 every turn. so 0 -&gt; 4 takes 4 turns
 MSmits: not necesarily need math. You can also do the simulation the way the game does. So no formula's, but a loop where you recalculate height and speed every turn
 MSmits: oh yeah, include the thrust sim in that (+1 per turn)
 Aldoggen: ayy I did death first search episode 2
 dude_guy: ayy good job
 Aldoggen: &lt;3
 Ayza: congrats
 putibuzu: thanks for the paper on ISMCTS derjack! very enlightening
 mdfarhansadiq: :D
 TheNuclearSausage_1905: how do I calculate when to turn on the thrusters? Im so confused by math
 Aldoggen: for mars lander lvl 1?
 TheNuclearSausage_1905: yeah
 Aldoggen: the simple method is to limit the vertical speed to be more than -40
 Aldoggen: i requires minimal math
 Aldoggen: by more than -40 I mean like -39 or -38 or even -30 if you want to play it safe
 Aldoggen: can you figure out a way to do that?
 TheNuclearSausage_1905: ill try idk
 Aldoggen: gl!
 SydM107: are weekly puzzles gone?
 5DN1L: they're become one type of events now
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/events">https://www.codingame.com/events</a>
 SydM107: not implemented yet?
 5DN1L: there were several puzzle events before
 5DN1L: new ones not yet announced
 SydM107: ok, thanks for the info.
 5DN1L: np
 SydM107: haven't been on in a long time
 5DN1L: i see
 Ayza: finally legend coding speed
 Ayza: clashing is a pain
 StevenV: so I finished in 224/1758, doesn't have time for this contests
 StevenV: anyway, which language should I learn for COC&#160;?
 Nerchio: anyone knows how to use release mode in C# on codingame?
 Ayza: ruby seems to always win
 Ayza: whether its shortest fastest or reverse
 Ayza: so ruby
 StevenV: thanks
 Ayza: np
 MSmits: that's not necessarily logical. Ruby is better for shortes, but if everyone uses Ruby for shortest, they automatically end up using it for the other 2 modes, even though it is not better
 MSmits: the most serious clashers use Ruby because of shortest only
 wediaklup: python has short, easy and fast solutions for many problems
 StevenV: well, I think it is much better than Java
 MSmits: you'd be fine using ruby for shortest and python for the other 2. But maybe it is more convenient to stick to 1 solution
 Ayza: yeah I mainly said that for shortest, but if it wins shortest then that could be a speed boost up for fastest/reverse
 Ayza: for those who are good at it of course
 MSmits: nah it's not a speed boost, being able to squeeze a few characters off does not make you faster in general
 Ayza: but your right it really doesn't matter for fastest, I use python and win whether it's a ruby user or not
 darkhorse64: short code is not fast code.
 wediaklup: Debugging squeezed code makes it actually slower
 MSmits: it's actually true for contests as well. If you look at the leaderboards it's always mostly c++ at the top, but the main reason for that is not that c++ is the best language. the main reason is that the best players use it
 MSmits: even for a heuristic contest where speed is no factor, it will still be c++ at the top for a large fraction, because the best players are used to it.
 Nerchio: yeah but for most sim contests you have no chance without c++
 DomiKo: what about rust?
 MSmits: I don't know to what extent that is true. I think mostly that is overstated
 MSmits: if you make a sim in java and i make a sim in c++ and your eval is better, you will win 
 MSmits: an extreme example is jace k's NN. He does no sims at all, jus eval
 MSmits: the simpler the game is, the more important performance/speed is
 StevenV: NN&#160;:
 MSmits: but contest games are often more complex, so there's lots of ways to do a search. Someone with a superior search type will win with a slower language
 darkhorse64: He spoils all the fun, no low level coding, no magic number tweaking
 darkhorse64: :relaxed:
 MSmits: yep
 DomiKo: there still is little magic number tweaking, but in training
 StevenV: does anyone use Java for NN?
 MSmits: not many i think, but there is no reason it wouldnt work
 StevenV: I've read Agade NN, but couldn't apply it for Multi, do you guy have any suggestion?
 jacek: i had NN in java at first, to make it work
 Aldoggen: I might start using java because I prefer it. if I get that far on this website, that is
 DomiKo: so jacek you wrote DQN in Java?
 jacek: yes
 StevenV: DQN?
 DomiKo: wow
 jacek: though for NN part i used jni for speed
 DomiKo: ohhh ok
 jacek: 4x faster
 jacek: java so performant eh
 DomiKo: yeah ehhh
 MSmits: our Japanese friends should be glad there was no re curse on this contest :P
 MSmits: he would have wrecked this with his NN framework
 jacek: probably it would be like my NN + sim
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but he's very fast and effiicent setting something like that up
 MSmits: bot the NN and sim
 MSmits: both
 ikadimi: hey all does someone know how to include lodash when working with twig template&#160;?
 MSmits: I don't even know what those are
 ikadimi: web tools
 jacek: i hope SG guys wont see this as insult because i was terrified of the game rules
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: the game rules were terrifying
 MSmits: you made use of the fact that they gave you the legal actions
 MSmits: and you made use of the referee they provided you
 MSmits: so it's more a compliment
 MSmits: they made it possible for you to do this
 StevenV: and do you guys suggestion anything that can help me apply NN in a Multi?
 MSmits: well Marchete made an azero framework for oware
 MSmits: not that there arent enough marchete clones yet
 StevenV: hmm
 MSmits: there's also not 1 way to do a NN in a multi
 MSmits: it depends on the type of game and on how you generate data to train on
 MSmits: this last contest might actually be a good practiceground
 DomiKo: not really
 MSmits: use jace k's method
 MSmits: why not
 StevenV: because I have never success for any multi, I think that If I can make it works for one, then I can see how it really works
 DomiKo: if you use jace k's method you have to use java
 StevenV: I am a Java developer, so no problem
 DomiKo: it will be much more educational if you write everything from scratch, and learn how to test each part
 MSmits: ah, well, I am used to creating my own local sims
 MSmits: so i would not use java
 StevenV: but what is jacek's method?
 MSmits: deep q learning value network
 DomiKo: but then this local sim is sooo hard, I guess you should start with something more simple
 MSmits: that's true DomiKo
 Dapps: MSmits how long does it usually take you to get local sim up and running? I was thinking of doing it but didn't.. probably should've
 MSmits: for boardgames, less than a day
 MSmits: for this contest it would be a few days
 MSmits: i didnt do it here
 Dapps: that's what i was afraid of. seems like this last one was a lot more complex
 MSmits: yeah i was gonna do a local sim, but then yurko helped me set up brutal tester locally
 DomiKo: it took me 2 days to write everyting
 MSmits: I should thank him in my PM, i was going to
 DomiKo: but still I don't know if it works
 jacek: i used java because i didnt bother writing sim
 DomiKo: and that was very smart
 MSmits: Dapps to be clear, i did write a simulation for this game in my bot, which is quite close to having a local arena
 MSmits: for some boardgames my arena literally consists of my bots telling it they won or not
 MSmits: with hardly any extra code
 Dapps: ah got it
 Dapps: after i catch up on sleep i might try it once this becomes a multi
 MSmits: i dont know how well you know these things, but DomiKo is right in saying it's not the easiest place to get started
 DomiKo: I suggest starting with something like connect 4, because is really easy game, you can clearly see if you bot is doing something, and sim is simple enough, if you don't want fancy AVX stuff
 StevenV: connect 4 doesn't have red league :D
 MSmits: no,  games made by players dont
 MSmits: it's a community contribution
 StevenV: I really like the league
 MSmits: do ultimate tic tac toe then
 MSmits: it has a legend league
 MSmits: it's also quite hard to reach without a sim
 MSmits: impossible even
 MSmits: you need a fast simulation
 MSmits: it's really simple too, maybe simpler than connect 4
 wlesavo: yeah, quite hard  is an understatement :slight_smile:
 StevenV: thanks UTTT seems good
 jacek: wlesavo thats what she...
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 MSmits: wlesavo I think it was a year or so that there only were a handful of people in uttt legend, like 30 or so
 MSmits: the fact that there are like 200 there now is a bit misleading. That took a  long time and a lot of people sharing tips on how to beat gold boss
 jacek: when i joined cg, there was left than 80
 jacek: my first legend
 jacek: less*
 wlesavo: more than a year for sure, it was my first c++ game and when i got legend it was already quite populated 
 wlesavo: i found pcr to be surprisingly easy, basically sim+smitsimax = top 10
 StevenV: pcr?
 wlesavo: pocer chip race
 wlesavo: poker*
 Nerchio: i had to optimize the shit out of my code in UTTT to reach legend with java
 Nerchio: but once you have it you can copy it to connect 4 :joy:
 StevenV: hmmmm
 MSmits: I reached it with C#, which was at that point same speed as Java. My experience was the same. Hyperoptimization
 wlesavo: the great thing about uttt is that many things can be effectively cashed by hashing board state
 MSmits: but StevenV do not worry, my current bot is 4x as fast as the one i reached legend with, so it's definitely doable, if hard
 StevenV: thanks you guys, I would give it a try soon
 MSmits: wlesavo you hashed board state?
 MSmits: why not create a simple array lookup?
 StevenV: anyway, do you guys think that Heuristic can go to legend for UTTT?
 Nerchio: no
 MSmits: no that is impossible
 MSmits: you might not even get out of silver
 StevenV: ah
 Nerchio: its too difficult to play for a human tbh
 MSmits: you can get to bronze just with some ifs though
 MSmits: bronze = full uttt 
 MSmits: &lt; bronze = normal tic tac toe
 StevenV: the point is that my C++ skill is bad&#160;:(
 MSmits: StevenV my first c++ program ever was a C# bot for uttt, converted to C++
 MSmits: took me 2 days to convert. 1000 lines
 MSmits: so instead of hello world, i went hello uttt
 MSmits: it helps that i built my bot out of very simple things like integers (bitboards). If I had used classes and structs and such, the conversion would have been much harder
 StevenV: I don't think I would write Java sim and then convert to C++
 MSmits: why not learn C# as an intermediary. It is very similar to java in many ways and you can use VS as an IDE
 MSmits: also faster than java now
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hi struct
 StevenV: hi
 putibuzu: hi
 SubZeRoy9: hi
 jacek:  
 Astrobytes: hi struct, good rest?
 MSmits: we were a little worried about you struct, you seemed to be losing it
 StevenV: I think I just write C++ sim directly
 jacek: struct still alive?
 struct: Im fine lol
 MSmits: StevenV yeah just keep it very simple
 StevenV: :D
 MSmits: be wary of pointers. Do it in small increments and unit test stuff
 struct: or dont use pointers
 MSmits: sometimes they are useful
 MSmits: but sure, references probably better
 MSmits: they can be confusing too though
 MSmits: use an object pool StevenV
 MSmits: Nodes[millions]
 StevenV: thanks
 struct: Do Tic tac toe first, you can reuse it for uttt
 struct: at least is what I did
 MSmits: dont create "new" objects during the game, that is both more complicated because it's c++ and it's slow
 MSmits: just use the massive object pool with an increasing index
 wlesavo: MSmits well thats what i meant by hashing there, since you can represent board as single int &lt;512
 MSmits: ahh ok
 StevenV: I wrote a gomoku with minimax in Java in University before. 
 MSmits: i even have had a 512*512 array
 MSmits: to include opponent
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: doing RAIC this year? (did I ask you that already?)
 MSmits: oh just use that here StevenV, adapt the sim. See how far it gets you
 MSmits: some people get to legend with minimax, in java even
 MSmits: it just means you eval needs to be really good
 StevenV: :D
 MSmits: I think dbd r got to legend that way, with java
 MSmits: before he became a rusty
 LuaAdventurer: guys is there an undo button in this 
 MSmits: ctrl + z
 wlesavo: Astrobytes i plan to, but i almost certainly wont be there for the finals, so ill have to finish early :slight_smile: but i really wont to see what they will come up with within this battle royal setting
 LuaAdventurer: ty bro
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: Yeah I'm hoping it's gonna be a nice game. Also hoping to hear something positive regarding prizes for us non-RU folks
 struct: only lookup I have for uttt is for wins
 LuaAdventurer: how do i switch stdin to stderr or stderout
 wlesavo: yeah, i also wonder how they will solve the delivering prizes issue within current logistic situation
 struct: and then I check if any player can still win earlier with it
 struct: They will just gift it to me
 MSmits: those phones from green circle will have a good amount of shipping cost :P
 Aldoggen: @LuaAdventurer depends on your language. if there are comments in your code, you can probably find it there
 LuaAdventurer: im using lua langage
 MSmits: I would not have guessed
 Aldoggen: I wouldn't have dared to assume :p
 struct: io.stderr:write("test\n")
 Aldoggen: I was about to type that lol
 LuaAdventurer: tysm @struct
 struct: np
 LuaAdventurer: can i ask another question
 jacek: i can understand some of the words <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1541376910877347840">https://twitter.com/i/events/1541376910877347840</a>
 Aldoggen: @LuaAdventurer you already did
 LuaAdventurer: 45MANHATTAN
 LuaAdventurer: WHAT IS THIS
 LuaAdventurer: oops caps
 struct: MCTS and you all voted it was a waste of time o.o
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 aCat: bowwow had some local visualization
 Astrobytes: ISMCTS no?
 struct: what is ismcts?
 Astrobytes: yeah, nice visualiser aCat
 aCat: mine images wrere prittier but I'm pretty sure his was more useful ;p
 Astrobytes: Information Set MCTS
 Astrobytes: struct
 struct: I see, thanks
 Nerchio: Val " As a playout player, I put a rule-based guy (about 10th in Legend as of Sunday)."
 Nerchio: top10 legend heuristic?
 j4at: is brutaltester fast enough for NN?
 jacek: i never used it
 j4at: Codingame should provide a working local version for every contest that works in every language. They can write the game in Java and autogenerate a wrapper for every language that communicates with the referee using sockets, like they auto-generate code for puzzles.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i see circle report, is there a leaderboard to look at?
 j4at: Not all of us know Java.
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/green-circle/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/green-circle/leaderboard/global</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx jace
 struct: I think you are asking for too much lol
 jacek: isnt this what referee already does? it just communicates via stdout
 MSmits: struct 60th is a very good rank. I think you rank higher than in some contest(s) where you reached legend dont you?
 j4at: I don't know how to the run the referee
 j4at: Although I didn't try
 jacek:  
 struct: My highest was 40th-50th in SC 21
 struct: But I tested for that contest
 struct: So I had 1 month 
 struct: But the player count was way higher
 j4at:  
 MSmits: yeah so you shouldn't beat yourself up for not reaching legend. It was a tough boss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Sp I ended up #1?
 struct: just unlucky 
 struct: As you can see acat got top 30
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in Silver, rofl
 struct: and his bot was in same position as mine
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thats what beating gold boss tends to do
 MSmits: deposits you in the middle of legend
 DomiKo: not really...
 MSmits: but not always
 MSmits: for me it did
 MSmits: in other games
 MSmits: one time legend was 100 players
 DomiKo: someone have to be last in legend :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: i got to 17 when i beat gold boss
 MSmits: ice and fire this was
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top 3 in a lang.  That's a new one for me
 jacek: and you complained when wala was chosen
 Nerchio: lol DomiKo
 MSmits: DomiKo the thing is that the gold boss often gets boosted far beyond its initial rating
 MSmits: so if you dont beat it intiially, you might not beat it at all
 DomiKo: not true again
 MSmits: it has been my experience in several contests
 DomiKo: I was promoted to legend at Saturday
 DomiKo: and I was dead last since then
 MSmits: yeah it's not a fixed rule for everyone, but it happened this way at least 3 times for me. For euler as well
 MSmits: this time it didnt happen for me either, i stayed near the bottom
 DomiKo: yeah that often happen
 MSmits: it could be a rock paper scissors thing
 MSmits: people weak to gold boss keep losing to it
 MSmits: people strong to gold boss, leave
 MSmits: so it boosts its rating
 MSmits: to ridiculous proportions
 struct: also rng
 MSmits: and you cant even get enough games vs it on submit
 struct: There are games where you are just unlucky
 struct: And cant do anything about it
 MSmits: because other people in the way that are strong vs you, but weak vs boss
 MSmits: you can push them out, but they keep submitting, so you dont get the chance
 wlesavo: for most of the old games i played i also get mid legend after beating the boss
 MSmits: before legend opened, euler had a bot as strong as me. I barely got into legend. Euler had to fight hard to get in, improving his bot. When he finally did get in, he was in the top half of legend
 Crosility: I looked at the leaderboards earlier..
 Crosility: Euler is in the top 5-10 over every leader-board category.
 SonByrne: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/13a142cf-300f-4c35-bfd1-1ecf68469e88">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/13a142cf-300f-4c35-bfd1-1ecf68469e88</a>
 Crosility: Crazy smart individual when it comes to programming.
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: he knows a lot
 SonByrne: not sure what happened with that last message
 jacek: too long
 jacek: and pastebins dont work anymore
 SonByrne: Kind of wish I didn't submit anything. I submitted the basic "starter" AI from GitHub just to watch some other bots.
 SonByrne: Then other than just experimenting with the code a little to figure out the basic mechanics, didn't really take the time to work on it
 SonByrne: So now I have an embarrassingly low ranking lol 
 MSmits: it doesnt hurt your overall ranking
 MSmits: i have some of those in my list too, from joining and then quittin after a few hrs, its fine
 SonByrne: good to know, wasn't really as intersted in the board game format if that makes any sense.
 MSmits: sure
 Crosility: I ended up not liking the dynamic/structure of the contest. Card game + a random option -&gt; a no skill / no try entry pre-made code.. put me off.
 Crosility: And the fact, I did like 2 submits of said code, thinking I might try. And somehow made to bronze with Random().. Yeah. Getting BETTER than that would have required so much more effort and time. Just the complexity of the card system itself was a lot to program in. So, back to pod racing and the like :P
 MSmits: totally understandable
 Aldoggen: I really wonder how lucky you got with that. I'd be very surprised if the wood league bots are on average worse than random
 JFB: jacek - congratulation for your 8th score. It looks that it is 1st time you are in Legend of the contest and right away in the top 10
 SonByrne: Yeah, I got the same vibe when I ran the starter code. I worked out a way to figure out which application I had the most cards for and felt like it was going to be really annoying to implement just to find out it's worse than Random()
 SonByrne: potentially
 jacek: thanks. eeyup
 Kellthazar: I'm really impressed by the solution described by jacek... 
 Aldoggen: was it mentioned in chat? I must have skimmed over it
 Kellthazar: I'm read it on the forum about the contest.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Is there already post ... oh
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/green-circle-feedback-strategies/196574">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/green-circle-feedback-strategies/196574</a>
 eulerscheZahl: also thank you for the detailed writeup jacek
 eulerscheZahl: reads like you could have done even better by implementing the engine and looking a bit ahead. you like additional challenges :D
 jacek: reading rules was bigger challenge
 Aldoggen: yeah I stopped bothering after that lol
 Aldoggen: I just read the post, nice man&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats what i said eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: just came, history doesn't go that far back
 MSmits: no i know
 MSmits: hey, you had a full search too right, like me?
 MSmits: I am wondering what you did better
 eulerscheZahl: not fully full. i did not simulate possible outcomes of draft
 MSmits: oh
 eulerscheZahl: probably the scoring function
 Astrobytes: also interested in bowwow's pm when he publishes it
 MSmits: yeah that's likely
 eulerscheZahl: i'll send you a private message with pastebin
 MSmits: oh cool, do you want mine too?
 jacek: pastebin dont work, beware
 MSmits: no, a real pastebin
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 eulerscheZahl: both bowwow and val growth tweeted about MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: so they made it work somehow
 MSmits: I was going to do mcts as well, combined with mc, it would not have a problem to code it, but i didnt know what heuristics to use
 MSmits: (for the random rollout)
 eulerscheZahl: same
 struct: They used this apparently euler 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/30267707.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/30267707.pdf</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i tried that path. but full random was obviously garbage
 eulerscheZahl: taking hundreds of turns to finish. more noise than anything. but somehow i won a few games in bottom gold
 struct: please dont say that word euler
 eulerscheZahl: garbage?
 jacek: path?
 Aldoggen: a?
 struct: g*ld
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the chemical element
 jacek: i feel guilty
 jacek: shall i make boss for backgammon
 struct: I still need to finish it
 darkhorse64: :scream:
 struct: But might be a bad idea jacek, the goal is to make another league
 struct: not keep it at 1
 Crosility: Am I allowed to mention other programming games/things unrelated to this site, here?
 darkhorse64: onee boss to rule them all
 Crosility: You know struct - I just now realized your a moderator (lol)
 eulerscheZahl: yes Crosility
 struct: brb
 eulerscheZahl: i'll mention one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/">https://www.gocoder.one/</a>
 Crosility: Has anyone played, does anyone play the programming game Bitburner?
 Aldoggen: quick, spam gold while struct isn't looking
 eulerscheZahl: but they want a $10 entrance fee
 Astrobytes: I got a free code in my mail
 Astrobytes: So I'll definitely play it this time, not gonna waste that
 Astrobytes: Crosility: I've played Bitburner a bit
 eulerscheZahl: i also get the voucher for coder one
 JFB: What is Bitburner?
 eulerscheZahl: when you put Astrobytes on fire
 eulerscheZahl: his ashes
 Astrobytes: :D
 Crosility: A game, sorta like an idle game, sorta like a hacking game. But you program everything you want to automate in javascript. It's actually really in-depth.
 Crosility: It's an incremental game, where you essentially automate the game with real code.
 Astrobytes: It's like a text-based RPG/puzzle game with idle elements but uses js for... yes what Crosility wrote
 Astrobytes: It is actually quite fun, and addictive
 jacek: javascript? :nauseated_face:
 Crosility: I have played it a bit, to learn Javascript.
 Aldoggen: I looked it up on steam, but it seems like there's a browser version too
 Astrobytes: only played the browser version
 Crosility: There's even a github version, where you can just compile your own version.
 Astrobytes: Yeah jacek, it's bearable though
 eulerscheZahl: i played yare in JS
 JFB: Maybe I till try but it looks too bit for my mind 
 JFB: *big
 JFB: Maybe sb want to try: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/leaderboard">https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/leaderboard</a>
 Crosility: You can start super small, and focused, it really puts in perspective the "break problems into little pieces" idea, so you aren't trying to tackle everything at once.
 JFB: It is still 13 days. 5 * $3000 prises
 Psyho: Crosility: I did play bitburner
 JFB: Unfortunatelly my bot is #9&#160;:-( now and decline 
 Psyho: (mostly as a research, since I have a pet project with idle game involving programming)
 Astrobytes: I strongly dislike the way kaggle works as a platform, always puts me off
 Crosility: Ooh, mine asteroids JFB. Looks interesting.
 Astrobytes: nice Psyho
 Psyho: I found the concept fun, but I kind of dislike the core mechanic
 eulerscheZahl: Kore completely went over my head. but a bit close to the CG one
 eulerscheZahl: how strong is the leaderboard?
 Crosility: Psyho - I hope you announce when you get further along with that. I really enjoy the idea. From the few games "Zachtronics" games to Bitburner, and some others - it's a good way to learn some hard concepts.
 Astrobytes: love those Zachtronics games, the asm-style ones are awesome
 Psyho: I agree, it's definitely underutilized concept
 Psyho: and Zachtronics (RIP&#160;:( ) is pretty much the only dev studio that use it well
 Astrobytes: Indeed it is
 Crosility: Those assembly language ones are SOOO hard at later stages. I envy people who can not pull their hair out on them.
 Astrobytes: and yeah, a sad loss there
 Psyho: my project is more about paradigm shifts (think "dark room"), where programming is just one of the layers
 Crosility: Wait, did they shut down?
 Crosility: (brb)
 Psyho: yes
 Astrobytes: Cool! That does sound interesting
 Psyho: they released their last project now
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just recently Crosility
 Crosility: Just saw, last project in july. I bet he comes back.
 Crosility: 11 years of great puzzles, and not quitting/leaving on a negative.
 SonByrne: It's kind of crazy to think that Roller Coaster tycoon was written in Assembly lol
 Crosility: "“We actually shut down Zachtronics once before, back in 2015, when I went to work at Valve for what ended up being 10 months."
 Crosility: Lol, case in point.
 eulerscheZahl: the first settlers was Assembly as well
 JFB: @eulerscheZahl - kore2022 leaderboard is rather strong 
 eulerscheZahl: so nothing to invest a few days and win money
 Crosility: Well, this was interesting. Back to trying to get my head wrapped around hash tables (in C - as in, creating from scratch)
 Psyho: is kore on kaggle halite 3?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it already started 2 months ago
 eulerscheZahl: i thought LuxAI is the new kaggle
 eulerscheZahl: new halite*
 JFB: @Psyho <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/leaderboard">https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/leaderboard</a>
 JFB: @eulerscheZahl - yes, 1till 13 days to the end
 eulerscheZahl: but catching up on 2 months of work
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not that good
 SonByrne: do you still work in game dev Crosility?
 JFB: You like short contest&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: then i should wait until next week
 JFB:&#160;:-D
 struct: just get a team euler
 Crosility: SonByrne- I don't remember ever stating I did. But no, I haven't in years. I just recently got back into programming.
 eulerscheZahl: i don't understand illedan's code
 Astrobytes: lol
 JFB: illedan's code do not understand even Illedan's code&#160;;-)
 jacek: illedan code?
 JFB: We discuss category "illedan's code"
 JFB: Not specific program
 struct: can I use c++ on kaggle?
 JFB: I think yes but it is no starter kit&#160;:-(
 struct: afk
 JFB: I planned to do so but ...
 eulerscheZahl: we collaborated on the vindinium port. then he refactored and i didn't find anything thereafter
 eulerscheZahl: and that's how i killed the chat
 Nerchio: :skull:
 Nerchio: vindinium was fun though thanks for porting :D
 JFB: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and that's what i love about MIT license
 eulerscheZahl: no questions ask, just do it.ornicar (creator) found out about it eventually but never reached out to me
 eulerscheZahl: unihedron shared a sceenshot from another chat. basically"hey, there's a port of your game""oh, ok"
 MSmits: vindinium is still on my list. I have been doing some cp hunting lately. maybe will do it over the summer
 eulerscheZahl: i really need a generic thing like jacek did for the contest
 eulerscheZahl: then i could join the hunt
 MSmits: generic thing?
 MSmits: oh wait your hunt is different
 eulerscheZahl: he didn't even implement the rules in his bot
 MSmits: you lack boardgame cp
 MSmits: yeah generic bot will help a lot for that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/7F7X7tr.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/7F7X7tr.jpg</a>
 MSmits: you still didn't do yavalath
 jacek: cant break any rules if you dont know rules
 eulerscheZahl: and for some of those that i started you can't count it as playing
 MSmits: wow so many euler
 MSmits: you made a serious bandas
 MSmits: and uttt is not bad
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. clash of bots
 eulerscheZahl: i submitted but below top50%
 MSmits: yeah i have a bunch of those as well
 MSmits: but i am mostly going for ex-contests now. Great escape is next
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium is also on my list
 MSmits: I am thinking about maybe running a meta mcts for great escape. 2p should be np. but first I want a good mcts bot
 MSmits: it's a very simple game, fits right in with the other board games
 MSmits: but hey, my offer stands about yavalath. If you end up doing it, I'll give you a bunch of tips 
 jacek: 3 3 is best opening
 eulerscheZahl: back then contests were highly different skill-wise
 eulerscheZahl: was even before my time
 MSmits: if you want to lose, sure :P
 MSmits: you mean the competitors were weaker?
 eulerscheZahl: i think so
 eulerscheZahl: if i could beam me back in time 5 years, i would have a chance for top3 i think
 eulerscheZahl: let's say 6-7 years
 MSmits: I wrote my c++ csb bot in 8 days or so and it was better than any in the live contest. It would have won
 JFB:&#160;:-) 
 eulerscheZahl: back then there was no public referee with physics
 MSmits: thats right
 MSmits: that makes things harder
 jacek: no refere?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i hated about fantastics bits
 eulerscheZahl: some know how it works from CSB (still a lot of reversing), the rest was forces to if-else it
 eulerscheZahl: forced
 JFB: As I understand they are still no referee to csb
 eulerscheZahl: the official one got leaked
 MSmits: but yeah apart from the referee business, competitors really were weaker up until about 2-3 years ago. When I joined, getting top 10 was not that hard for me
 JFB: ok
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/tree/master/Referees">https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/tree/master/Referees</a>
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - if you want I can extract my sim for fantastic bits 
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 eulerscheZahl: we have the official one and magus shared his as well

 eulerscheZahl: no
 _Royale: jacek: "hidden layer at first 32 nodes" was it for performance reasons? or to find your hyperparameters faster?
 eulerscheZahl: arrow up to recover your message ElCimici
 jacek: _Royale to find hyperparameters faster
 eulerscheZahl: "performance or to do it faster" :D
 _Royale: haha
 jacek: the bos has 96
 jacek: s
 _Royale: best troll boss ever&#160;:-D
 MSmits: first NN boss ever
 MSmits: isn't it?
 MSmits: think you made history there jacek
 jacek: as euler said, boss is stupid
 MSmits: it's hard to be a NN boss. Either NN completely fails or it's too strong to be a boss, usually
 MSmits: it was funny how they just made the nr 1 boss first :P
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't say stupid
 eulerscheZahl: i said idiot
 MSmits: what is wrong with it?
 eulerscheZahl: but meant the character, not the intelligence. he stopped me from legend at that time
 eulerscheZahl: a**hole
 kovi: "cant break any rules if you dont know rules"valid. nn could probably find cheese combo as well
 MSmits: apphole?
 putibuzu: :D
 eulerscheZahl: like my herokuapp. just a hole left. 404
 JFB: 404 == RIP
 jacek: Autmaton2000 what did you kill the chat
 jacek: Automaton2000 -.-
 Automaton2000: [auto] hey waterproofsodium, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet. you now have 5 tacos ...
 jacek: oh he isnt online
 HenroLST: what the
 HenroLST: i wanna taco
 Wishmesucc: hello
 xGuGu: hi:wave_tone1:
 ElCimici: HOW CAN i convert string to int
 ElCimici: c++
 galuso: stoi() function
 wryte94: google that exact question
 ElCimici: can i use stoi on a char?
 5DN1L: try it and you'll know the answer?
 Bob_Rocks: Should I try to convert puzzles I've already solved in one language to another language?
 Kellthazar: Maybe, are you learning a new language? Could be a nice way to improve your skills on that language.
 Illedan: GG jacek, great PM&#160;:)
 jvclab2: no
 computerfive: ummm
 Bob_Rocks: What should I be striving to do in teh puzzles?
 5DN1L: What do you mean?
 Bob_Rocks: I look at the best solutions and I see people using a bunch of functions that make things really hard to read but really short 
 Bob_Rocks: Should I be striving to do the same? Or should I just be trying to finish the puzzle? Or should I be trying to find the most efficient thing?
 5DN1L: It depends on what you want to learn
 jacek: shortest unreadable code is quite meh at work
 Bob_Rocks: Okay
 Astrobytes: "quite meh"&#160;? And there was me thinking it was perfectly acceptable to treat the codebase like your personal golfed obfuscation playground
 eulerscheZahl: how to make your colleagues your enemies
 eulerscheZahl: struct still hasn't deleted. maybe we can keep him, would be nice
 Astrobytes: hehehe nah, he'll not be deleting his account anytime soon I believe&#160;:)
 myking467: so i am mew and ... ok i know a litle bit of c++ but the game didnt let me use any functions so can you help me
 jacek: what game? what functions
 myking467: power of thor
 myking467: if , for , while ex
 wryte94: power of thor is simple, u dont need many functions
 wryte94: you just check your position right now relative to the light
 wryte94: then move in the direction u need to go from that position
 jacek: and do you have C++ above the ide?
 myking467: dont you have to macke an algorthem that does all of the stages automaticly?
 myking467: i know how to go north and south
 eulerscheZahl: then do the same with east and west
 eulerscheZahl: also note: the game doesn't give you the updated Thor position. you have to do that yourself
 myking467: so then i did it i finished all of them
 myking467: with north and south
 myking467: comands
 eulerscheZahl: you have to make it work for all at once. one code that can go in all directions based on given inputs
 myking467: how tho
 wryte94: i sent u a message myking
 wryte94: explaining it
 myking467: as i sed i am mew
 jacek: you have HINTS on the left
 Aldoggen: i am mewtoo
 5DN1L: are you mew3, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: what happened to the leaderboard
 myking467: oh i see so if does work sory mb
 5DN1L: if it does work now for you, then great :D
 myking467: thanks a lot i will see 
 myking467: :grinning:

 computerfive: its totally th ebest
 skeskin: im loser
 computerfive: thor?
 Astrobytes: Welp. Chat's back to normal.
 computerfive: no
 jvclab1: What is this how do i play this game?
 skeskin: yes.. thor..
 myking467: you code
 1942wasagoodtime: yes
 computerfive: yes
 computereight: uhhhhh yea
 1942wasagoodtime: p
 computerfive: mhm
 computerfive: JAMES
 computereight: who wants number mine
 Wishbone: Thor is confusing when you're used to controlling things yourself.
 computerfive: not me
 IvesL: very wierd
 IvesL: i was trying to scan some of my old bots and try to rerun
 Wishbone: The whole "secret game engine that you control through arbitrary console output" is not very intuitive.
 IvesL: then i got:Unknown error (stacktrace too big)
 IvesL: never seen this before
 SEMAJbackwards: hey james
 IvesL: anyone know whats about it
 computerthree: dude don't say our names 
 SEMAJbackwards: Ok
 computerthree: :expressionless:
 myking467:  you guys are fluding the chat so if you aree not talking about code than it would be good if you stoped

 Crosility: Was copying the chat. But yes, you're spamming.
 SEMAJbackwards: who
 SEMAJbackwards: im lame? ok
 jvclab1: YES KADEN IS LAMEEE
 5DN1L: kicked jvclab1, next is a ban
 computerthree: uh
 camicam: hbhvbjvcb
 computerthree: huh
 5DN1L: kicked camicam, next is a ban
 Crosility: Just me or you can't click computer three,four,five,eight 's profile link, and camicam's?
 computerthree: so?
 5DN1L: sometimes it doesn't work, Crosility
 5DN1L: then you have to search their profile
 computerthree: have fun trying to find it
 computerthree: bye
 Crosility: Interesting. Thanks 5DN1L
 5DN1L: np
 5DN1L: weirdly guys who all share the same logo
 5DN1L: as their profile pic
 Crosility: Same logo, 1 puzzle each.
 james9789765767: we doing a program 
 Ayza: I suspect they are all the same person
 Ayza: you can't respond to your friend this fast
 jacek: Automaton2000 is that true?
 james9789765767: were all in the same rom
 Automaton2000: we are the only one
 Crosility: A program, or are you spamming the server with accounts, and the chat-obviously?
 5DN1L: don't be part of them, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why am i so bad at this
 eulerscheZahl: play pokemon with them: catch (kick) them all
 james9789765767: its a  program for summer
 Astrobytes: schoolkids. It's always schoolkids.
 jacek: dont they have vacation now
 SEMAJbackwards: i know ur not talking
 Astrobytes: jacek: "it's a program for summer"
 eulerscheZahl: in bavaria summer holidays start in early august
 Ayza: cool program, can be done somewhere else
 Crosility: Well, 1942 was the nuclear bomb drops, and WWII, so someone has a sick mind to name their account "1942wasagoodtime"
 Astrobytes: they started a week ago already here in Scotland
 Astrobytes: (school holidays)
 Astrobytes: Crosility: clearly trying to be 'edgy'
 Crosility: So, the james9789765767, only friend is "SEMAJbackwards".. james.. backwards.
 Crosility: Sigh, nothing against juvenile behavior. But, it's disappointing how bad it was done.
 eulerscheZahl: not sure about testing them, but the bombs on japan were in 1945
 Crosility: Astrobytes - if only their edgy was "better"
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Astrobytes: and indeed euler
 eulerscheZahl: germany had already surrendered at that time, would have been a likely target otherwise
 Crosility: Correct, sorry eulerscheZahl.
 Astrobytes: 6th and 9th of August
 eulerscheZahl: that's something i would have to look up
 eulerscheZahl: but i knew it was after german capitulation, you learn that in history class excessively here
 eulerscheZahl: japan on the other hand didn't play much of a role
 Astrobytes: I always remember it. My birthday is the 7th. I tend to forget my birthday when it comes though.
 eulerscheZahl: and then it hits you like a bomb?
 Astrobytes: oof
 Crosility: 2 and 5's. And I served in Japan for 3 years on Kyushu Island next to nagasaki. I would think after all the training I wouldn't forget that. &lt;.&lt;
 GNye22: Hey, why can you only view code for certain clash of code participants?
 Crosility: They have to submit GNye22
 eulerscheZahl: they have to click "share"
 Crosility: (Like, submit to be public)
 GNye22: ohhhhh
 Astrobytes: My friend was in Nagasaki and Hiroshima a few years ago (a month around Japan). Humbling he said.
 eulerscheZahl: some are bots. bots don't share (or did they change that now?)
 Ayza: bots do share now
 Astrobytes: some of the bots share at least
 jacek: by default
 Crosility: Very humbling. Especially the Peace Memorial Museum and drop site in Nagasaki 
 Astrobytes: Yes. And the Memorial Park in Hiroshima
 Astrobytes: People forget about all that too easily these days.
 5DN1L: agreed
 Westicles: the Pearl Harbor memorial is beautiful as well
 Westicles: and I'm sure Nanjing has something lovely
 Astrobytes: The odd one out there is Pearl Harbour
 Westicles: 68 dead civilians not enough for you?
 Astrobytes: Any dead civilian or military is too much
 OldJohn: Jacek during Q learning your program played each side&#160;?
 HenroLST: quick question, how would i erase a whole vector from a vector of vectors
 JFB: HenroLST - what language? C++? Python? 
 jacek: OldJohn yes, one network
 HenroLST: c++
 jacek: if next state was other played, then its y * -Qmax
 jacek: vector.erase(vector.begin()+position)
 jacek: other player*
 HenroLST: ah so it works like a normal vector
 HenroLST: thanks!
 OldJohn: jacek ok  it makes sense...
 Rikus: How many refurbished phones would it take to see the code jacek&#160;? :eyes:
 5DN1L: yes
 jacek: theres not even refurbished t-shirts
 Rikus: ok nvm then! I'll then give it another shot at failing-to-learn-some-CG-applicable-ML
 struct: hi
 MSmits: sup struct
 jacek: good evening
 MSmits: I wonder if I can solve the great escape 2p version
 MSmits: it seems solvable
 jacek: so, quoridor?
 MSmits: whats that
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/624/quoridor">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/624/quoridor</a>
 jacek: apparently great escape was based on that
 MSmits: seems bigger
 jacek: though adjacent pieces could jump i think
 MSmits: oh no, i see it is 9x9
 struct: Anyone has any idea how to connect 2 progrmas in c++?
 struct: like on giving inputs and other outputs?
 MSmits: nope
 struct: I'm going hard on the next contest, I'm starting this week
 MSmits: what contest
 jacek: pragmas?
 struct: jacek I want two programs to comunicate with each other
 struct: like one would be the referee and the other would be the bot
 struct: MSmits well the next one
 MSmits: why would you want to do it that way?
 Astrobytes: piping on linux, it's a lot less trivial on win though
 struct: So its easier to test multiple versions
 struct: I can use wsl I guess
 MSmits: ah 
 j4at: use sockets?
 jacek: for neuroevolution stuff in python i have socket and write floats in file
 Astrobytes: I think it's on agade's repo... there's an arena for something which is a nice example
 MSmits: i dont even know what a socket is
 jacek: i use socket to communicate new floats are arrived
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CSB-Runner-Arena/blob/master/Arena.cpp">https://github.com/Agade09/CSB-Runner-Arena/blob/master/Arena.cpp</a>
 struct: This Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: I think it was that yeah
 struct: Thanks
 jacek: will there ever be next contest?
 struct: I hope so
 Astrobytes: You can always run instances of the same agent with different parameters
 MSmits: sebastien was giving advice to future creators
 Astrobytes: instead I mean
 MSmits: so i assume so
 struct: I'm going to improve my framework and add a lot more searches 
 Astrobytes: and just plug them into the game sim/referee
 struct: Yes
 struct: I won't fail again
 MSmits: I am not sure if this is the best way
 struct: jacek please next time don't use NNs
 MSmits: if the contest is really complex sure
 struct: MSmits why not?
 MSmits: but if it is within reason and you code the sim anyway, its not that hard to code your own referee
 MSmits: one that is much faster
 struct: I will code the referee
 struct: but ill have the search ready
 struct: and Ill just need to plug the gamestate to it
 MSmits: there are a lot of searches though
 MSmits: but sure it cant hurt to have some ready
 MSmits: i generally just copy from an old bot
 struct: Yeah that works but when I copy paste I generally overlook and implement bugs
 MSmits: i hardly copied any code this time around. It was basically 3k lines of fresh code&#160;:(
 MSmits: one both of 1800 lines and one bot of 1200 lines
 MSmits: bot
 struct: I spent too much time rewriting
 MSmits: never coded so much before in a contest
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: but i would not have known what else to do with my time
 struct: and one of my bot has a bug
 struct: I dont know if it sthe submit
 struct: or the other one
 struct: During the search
 jacek: no search - no bugs
 MSmits: if neither one could beat gold boss, then the bug has had no effect on your rank, you're right at the top of gold
 struct: One generates all possible actions including the multiple possible trainings combos
 MSmits: you have bugs, your bot assumes you can play 1 card, when you can play 2 and it does not know where it is moving to when throwing cards. That's worse than the last few bugs i fixed jacek
 struct: The other one finds them on the search
 struct: Also my bot doesnt know that it can play code review and then continuous integration...
 struct: ah but the cards go into discard
 struct: it should be fine
 MSmits: yeah it is
 MSmits: the order of task proritization and other cards does matter
 struct: my order was the default order of the cards in inputs
 struct: I should have changed it
 MSmits: if you did a full search it doesnt matter
 struct: no i stopped if the type &lt; previous
 MSmits: if you tried to enforce an order to reduce branching it does, but you can use heuristics
 MSmits: i had one where i always wanted my bot to do refactor first, but still allowed a refactor after task prio
 MSmits: this is because when you win, you want to make sure you played refactor
 MSmits: (to reduce TD)
 MSmits: i replace a "bestmove" when score &gt; best, so if i try refactor first, i make sure it is preferrd
 MSmits: probably never mattered though
 MSmits: btw, your bot really was not that much weaker than mine. I was bottom legend whole weekend
 MSmits: somehow got to 43rd on recalc
 struct: yeah its hard to say though
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: I have a bot that beats my current one easily
 struct: but cant climb or w/e
 MSmits: we should let it go and focus on the future&#160;:)
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: I would much prefer to have a nn framework over a contest framework
 MSmits: I can deal with the search/arena stuff without any special preparation, but nn;s are a differen thing
 Astrobytes: get making one then&#160;;)
 TheRadioControlledClown_7d9: ok
 j4at: nn frameworks already exist :p
 struct: well one requires skills I don't have
 MSmits: yeah but they can be learned
 struct: I don't know math 
 MSmits: neither does jace k really, at least thats what he says
 struct: jacek do you understand how an NN adjusts weights?
 MSmits: he just makes his bot do what the papers say and the examples of code he saw
 Astrobytes: pretty sure the time I spent learning that game during the contest could have been used for learning about NNs and been more productive :P
 struct: Because I don't
 MSmits: i understand it when i read about it, but it fades quickly
 MSmits: once you coded the functions for it, it's fine
 MSmits: especially if you use a library
 k4ng0u: it feels like more and more contestants are using NN, are there recommended tutorials for those?
 struct: k4ng0u have you seen marchete playground?
 struct: He shared his code for his oware NN
 MSmits: not really, you can do some xor examples. maybe mnist. Then look at some examples people shared for boardgames here
 MSmits: start with simple games anyway
 struct: also jacek xor example
 k4ng0u: nope, any links to those?

 MSmits: don't make me counterbook another nn :P
 k4ng0u: thx struct!
 struct: Though I think this is a thing that takes a lot of time to understand
 struct: and I like to see results in one day
 struct: Which is not feasible in this case
 j4at: Jacek is wasting his time using c++; I know it's fun and all. But he is using basic nns after all. He used MLP DQN you can write that in 30 minutes in Python. or In 1 minute if you use a library :p Although yeah you probably will not have the same results as jacek in 30 mins because you need hyperparameters tuning. And study different types of inputs/outputs
 MSmits: I understand it enough I think, but i keep seeing new shiny things i like more
 struct: MSmits I think you should just start doing it
 MSmits: you're right
 struct: Why not try on a simple game like BT?
 MSmits: my next step was nmm
 MSmits: i have the endgame solved
 struct: On BT its so easy to tell if a bot plays well or not
 MSmits: (after placement)
 MSmits: can solve the rest if given a few days prolly
 MSmits: then train value network 
 MSmits: best thing is, i dont need to know if it plays well. I just need to know if it gives the right value answer, because the solved result is correct
 struct: seems like a plan
 MSmits: yeah it is
 MSmits: i have some weeks off
 struct: Anyways I have to go afk again.
 jacek: j4at basic nns, but they work
 jacek: and i like MLP
 MSmits: i have to go sleep, gn 
 struct: gn
 j4at: If you use python you will have ended up with a better result believe me
 MSmits: j4at you mean because of the tensorflow libs?
 j4at: yeah tensorflow/pytorch + higher level libraries
 MSmits: you are limited in how you translate this to CG though
 MSmits: CG does not have them, so it's an added complexity
 jacek: you only need forward for CG
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: but you have to replicate what tf does exactly, it's kind of a black box. 
 MSmits: trying to understand what it does already means you're giving up part of what it was doing for you
 j4at: You can read source code&#160;:)
 jacek: its just matrix multiplication most of the time
 MSmits: yeah, i think it is a better way, but it's not trivial is all i'm saying
 MSmits: marchete solved this problem
 j4at: What activation functions are you using jacek&#160;?
 jacek: relu for hidden
 j4at: I bet  you didn't try any other activations
 jacek: relu is fast
 jacek: well here maybe not that needed. but in board games search yes
 j4at: fast is not important in this case&#160;?
 MSmits: for learning
 MSmits: not for using on CG
 jacek: youre probably talking about mish or other swish
 j4at: I always start with gelu. And then try others including relu
 j4at: there is a lot of fine tunining that you can do only in python
 j4at: You could have implemented rainbow for example instead of simple double dqn
 MSmits: that looks good in a p,
 MSmits: pm
 MSmits: I used... Rainbow!!
 MSmits: :rainbow:
 j4at: lmao
 jacek: ... dash
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: that makes it even better
 jacek: i still was just learning. before i had mediocre results with dqn, now it worked somewhat
 jacek: and if going full libraries, id try something more advanced like actor critic, trpo/ppo etc.

 Darleanow: anyone playing clash&#160;?
 iflysohigh: always brotha
 Darleanow: copme here then :p
 struct: hi
 Darleanow: hey struct&#160;!!
 Darleanow: u know who made Bsod&#160;?
 Darleanow: (the bot)
 struct: which bot?
 Darleanow: Bsod
 Astrobytes: clash I presume (and hi)
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/935c902624dbe460f2c3176a08861ba46420652">https://www.codingame.com/profile/935c902624dbe460f2c3176a08861ba46420652</a>
 struct: no idea whats happening
 Darleanow: I'M ANGRY AGAINST HIM
 iflysohigh: lol
 struct: how much time?
 Westicles: The quality of people doing clashes has gone way down lately.  You see it in the contribs, what used to be clashes are now forced up to easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: I presume apathy has set in amongst the more oldskool/pro clashers
 struct: I think its an official CG bot
 Westicles: I think they lost interest when all the streamers got real jobs after covid
 struct: Maybe I should stream
 Astrobytes: :D
 Darleanow: You def should&#160;!!
 Astrobytes: stream clashes?
 Darleanow: i mean, you're forced to finish them real quick
 struct: no, maybe a multi
 Darleanow: which is actually the goal of clash
 struct: clashes would just me googling when math is needed
 struct: would just be me*
 Astrobytes: Sure, might get a few random people more interested at least (not including the core people)
 Westicles: 8 hours of mumbling and typing sounds.  no indication of what you are trying to do
 Astrobytes: BUT don't put yourself under any pressure, just chill
 struct: lol
 struct: I could just stream a connect 4 bot
 struct: i would make it in 1 hour or something around
 struct: that
 struct: and get top 20
 Westicles: I would watch that
 Astrobytes: What if you have to explain bitboarding tho
 struct: you dont need bitboards for top 20
 Astrobytes: meh
 struct: ofc bitboards are the interesting part
 struct: maybe breakthrough would be easier to explain
 struct: Anyways is just an idea, I might wake up tomorrow and just forget it
 Astrobytes: You could do weekly streams. 'Bitboarding Weekly with struct' :D
 Westicles: tulips and daisies
 Astrobytes: that game with the annoying cheese that everyone does?
 Westicles: that's tulips and dairies
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: well played sir 
 waterproofsodium: struct: you might be able to answer this
 waterproofsodium: did you ever encounter google foobar challenge?
 struct: wdym waterproofsodium?
 waterproofsodium: I just got it and I'm considering whether I should invest time in it because it goes over a longer time
 struct: normal foobarr?
 waterproofsodium: well google foobar challenge which shows up when you google programming related stuff
 waterproofsodium: which is not the famous foobar problem
 Astrobytes: that the hiring thing they do?
 waterproofsodium: yes
 waterproofsodium: I wonder how many here got it. I actually think a lot should have got it because we all search coding related stuff all day
 waterproofsodium: I'm just wondering if it's worth the time investment
 Astrobytes: No idea tbh
 struct: I dont think google is interested in me knowing mcts, minimax
 struct: They want people that know algos, that's not m
 waterproofsodium: oh ok. thought you were solving problems = algos
 Westicles: Nah, they need warm bodies for boring android stuff
 struct: Next they will ask me to use Java
 waterproofsodium: rip
 waterproofsodium: def worth in my time consideration
 Westicles: most fun would probably be doing embedded code for HW projects
 waterproofsodium: *time investment consideration
 struct: Also Im not very good at programming 
 struct: tbh
 waterproofsodium: somehow you're good at taking a high rank xD
 struct: Well it took a lot of time
 struct: I have improved in the past years though
 waterproofsodium: well I would guess you are somewhat decent then
 Westicles: someone at your level would be a manager and never actually write anything
 struct: lol Westicles
 waterproofsodium: :D
 struct: Maybe I should move to US then
 struct: I can't even get a programming job..
 waterproofsodium: getting a good job is not simple
 struct: last programming interview I had was a while ago
 struct: they asked me to use FoxPro
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Grim
 waterproofsodium: hm you learn something new every day..
 struct: no water
 struct: I'm not gonna waste time on learning a thing that's discontinued 
 struct: and that probaly less than 1% of companies use
 waterproofsodium: yeah discontinued is half a red flag
 struct: But this is just my point of view
 Astrobytes: that was the basis for our old stock management system at the first pharma place I worked
 Astrobytes: (foxpro)
 struct: I'm not saying it's bad
 struct: Is just that I would be stuck there
 Westicles: the trick is to only look for c/c++ jobs.
 Astrobytes: No. It is in fact, awful
 Westicles: usually something interesting tied to HW
 waterproofsodium: hey Westicles how serious were you about google mostly hiring for bad positions through that foobar challenge?
 Westicles: I was joking, but check and see if they are still hiring based on that
 waterproofsodium: great thanks for clarifying
 struct: maybe if they ask me to code a MCTS I can pass
 waterproofsodium: hm you get a ton of time for the challenges btw
 waterproofsodium: a lot of people here would get high in it I'm sure
 waterproofsodium: level 1 had 7 days
 Astrobytes: sounds like you'd have more chance by applying directly 
 Astrobytes: if the challenges are that easy
 waterproofsodium: i don't know
 waterproofsodium: but if they want it to be a filter for "good engineers" then they just need to make the other levels more difficult
 waterproofsodium: which I would assume
 Astrobytes: You would think they'd be at codejam round 2 level +
 struct: seems like it's hiring anyone that knows how to code
 struct: which seems strange
 Westicles: at least in the US the model seems to be hire big school guys, then have them manage teams in India/China that do the coding
 waterproofsodium: they have 5 levels I think it would be reasonable that their level 4 was at least as hard as the hard problems on codingame
 Astrobytes: that's a worldwide trend Westicles
 Astrobytes: anyway, going to bed gn all(and I'm still chuckling at "tulips and dairies)
 struct: gn
 waterproofsodium: gn
 waterproofsodium: hm I am confident I can solve all 5 levels..
 waterproofsodium: ..if I ask people in this chat for help&#160;;)
 struct: I'm very bad at puzzles actually
 waterproofsodium: i'm only good at things I did before :P
 struct: It takes time to switch into puzzle mode
 waterproofsodium: that is true
 waterproofsodium: most of the time I'm not in it
 Westicles: hah, well my latest puzzle was made for you
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/227854b2b312e0ee983a0d017a64b6ffa95a3">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/227854b2b312e0ee983a0d017a64b6ffa95a3</a>
 waterproofsodium: sounds like clickbait :p
 Westicles: yeah :P  
 waterproofsodium: i upvoted
 waterproofsodium: now give me tacos
 Westicles: I was disappointed, even cleaning up the solution to make it 10x faster I couldn't put a decimal point on the solutions
 Westicles: :taco: waterproofsodium
 Westicles: I don't think wonton hangs out here much these days
 waterproofsodium: this is a fair exchange *nom nom
 waterproofsodium: time for me to leave
 waterproofsodium: gn
 struct: gn
 vvinter: hello
 Crosility: YES!
 Crosility: I finally learned hashtables, and solved this MIME Type puzzle -.-
 Crosility: (In C - so - I had to learn to fully implement my own hashtable, no premade)
 vvinter: good job!!!
 HenroLST: WOOHOO nice :thumbsup:
 Crosility: Thanks :D
 struct: gj Crosility
 HenroLST: hey struct, if i were to want to make a coordinate plane and manipulate it in c++ what would be the most effiecient method?
 struct: What is this for?
 HenroLST: its a puzzle, however the coordinate plane is not nessacery, its just me being extra, I was jsut curious if I were to do it what would be best. I tried a vector of vector of pairs but it ran pretty slow
 struct: Well In c++ you usually need to add pragmas
 struct: or the code will end up being a bit slow
 struct: also how big was the vector?
 struct: vectors are slow if you keep allocating memory while inserting
 HenroLST: i just set it as 10 by 10, however ideally it could run with higher numbers, say 100 by 100
 struct: You should allocate memory on creation if possible
 struct: vector&lt;int&gt; vec(10000); for example
 HenroLST: yup
 HenroLST: the thing was i had to constantly iterate through the vector of vectors to check if certain elements had to be removed
 Crosility: I was able to solve all test cases&#160;:(, but not the Validators. This puzzle is the death of me. 85%.. I'll have to come back to this one. Sigh. "Limit size of extensions".. though it explicitly says no extensions will be above 10.. but *shrug*, and "Detection of same prefix extensions".
 struct: usually I use C type arrays
 struct: And when I need to remove I just do this
 struct: swap(arr[index], array[size-1]);size--;
 struct: So you swap the one you want to delete
 struct: with the last one
 struct: and then change the size
 HenroLST: ah, thats smart, I was just declaring another vector of vectors to mimic the current one then resetting the current vector and re adding all elements that satisfied the conditions
 Darleanow: guys, just made this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/22983c288d1eb034dd97e682447115d29921b">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/22983c288d1eb034dd97e682447115d29921b</a>
 struct: well you can still change the current with last
 struct: and then use pop_back() HenroLST
 Darleanow: could u upvote/downvote depending on how u find it&#160;:)
 struct: you can do vec[i] = vec.back();vec.pop_back();
 HenroLST: but what about mass deletions? for example if the vector looked like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d316df3-d738-4350-b6df-38691b674b2c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d316df3-d738-4350-b6df-38691b674b2c</a>
 HenroLST: hm why link weird
 struct: too much text
 struct: and pastebins are broken 
 HenroLST: uh say i wanted to delete all elements with a certain condition
 HenroLST: like in a coordinate plane all coordinates with a x value over 6
 struct: well I would probably just use a for loop
 HenroLST: ok, thanks!
 struct: The problem is that if you have
 struct: vec = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6};
 struct: and erase 0
 struct: then the vec will need to move everything
 struct: by one
 HenroLST: yeah, thats why i was creating a idential vector, emptying the original, then re adding each element
 HenroLST: but it took some time
 struct: Did you use pragmas?
 struct: or are you doing this in your machine?
 HenroLST: uh i think machine
 struct: gcc or msvc?
 HenroLST: just the one provided by coding game, not sure what it is
 struct: Try #pragma GCC optimize("O3","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 struct: put that at the top of the file
 HenroLST: ok
 HenroLST: oop yeah it ran faster
 HenroLST: ima have to memorize that line
 HenroLST: thank you very much :slight_smile:
 struct: np
 GoodGoodNotBad: Has anyone completed There is no Spoon part 1 in c++&#160;? The default code is timing out :confused:
 struct: it works fine for me
 struct: This is the output for the first test
 struct: cout &lt;&lt; "0 0 1 0 0 1" &lt;&lt; endl;cout &lt;&lt; "1 0 -1 -1 -1 -1" &lt;&lt; endl;cout &lt;&lt; "0 1 -1 -1 -1 -1" &lt;&lt; endl;
 GoodGoodNotBad: How odd, I'll double check. Thanks!
 Westicles: Darleanow, it'll get rejected for binary outputs
 Darleanow: But some clashes do have binary outputs&#160;:'(
 Westicles: Sure, but it is just about the only rule, some people will reject
 Darleanow: oh okk
 HenroLST: does anyone know why for some reason when im doing a binary search one of my numbers randomly shoots outside one of the bounds mid search?
 Crosility: Are you explicitly stating your bounds?
 HenroLST: im constantly updating them with each iteration
 HenroLST: however they dictate what my new number will be, within their ranges
 zxc_school: hiii
 Westicles: why did everyone's  CP go down except me?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html</a>
 Westicles: oh, contest decay, never mind
 eulerscheZahl: you are bad at contests?
 Westicles: yes, that was my conclusion as well
 eulerscheZahl: i played nice and commented on Darleanow's clash
 struct: Do you try to make a bot though?
 eulerscheZahl: not very hard. i'm sure you could do better
 Westicles: I never read a single word of the statement
 struct: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: are you not interested in bot programming in general Westicles?
 Westicles: I would like to have the skills to whip up an NN but seems like a lot of work
 emh: why is everyone up so early?
 eulerscheZahl: almost 6am
 struct: well I have to go to sleep yet
 emh: ok hehe
 eulerscheZahl: me: already awakestruct: still awake
 struct: so its not early, its just very late
 eulerscheZahl: for struct it's 4 or 5am, not sure
 struct: 4:55
 eulerscheZahl: 5:55 here. so just 1h difference
 struct: yeah
 emh: here too
 eulerscheZahl: but probably more like 1.5h if we go by the sun
 eulerscheZahl: do the birds already start singing at your place struct?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: then it's bed time for you
 struct: wait not yet
 struct: In around 30 minutes they will start
 struct: Anyways it's time for me to go and get some rest
 struct: Have a good day every1
 eulerscheZahl: you too
 emh: thank you and good night struct

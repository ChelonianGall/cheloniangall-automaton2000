 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 LastRick: that's exactly what i'm trying NOT to do
 LastRick: Holy wow. That jumped me all the way to top 75 Gold. So close, @MadKnight.
 MadKnight: do u start going towards future nextCP early&#160;?
 LastRick: yeah, I bank. But now I will probably revisit my banking seeing how it's turning a lot better now
 MadKnight: u need to somehow improve your condition of when to "bank"
 LastRick: Oh yeah, definitely. I think thats the last hurdle to legend, when to bank + a slight offset to the bank
 MadKnight: u can calculate movement 
 MadKnight: pos += vel
 MadKnight: to check if it hits checkpoint in a few turns
 MadKnight: LastRick
 LastRick: In other words, if I start banking "now", would it stop before getting there? if so, don't bank yet
 MadKnight: like, would it miss checkpoint&#160;?
 LastRick: yeah
 MadKnight: yea check for it
 LastRick: Interesting. this feels like some math coming on.&#160;:)
 MadKnight: some basic gamedev math 
 LastRick: for you guys, this is all new to me. Never done anything remotely like this. 
 MadKnight: u just need some operations with vectors
 LastRick: yeah, i got work to do it would seem
 NguyenVinhHien: whats wrong with the server?
 NguyenVinhHien: error 504
 Amirfluids: Something is wrong with Dungeons and Maps - Epic quest
 Amirfluids: Map 3 does not load properly
 Amirfluids: took me an entire evening to double check everything
 Amirfluids: code works on Jupyter
 Rockstar555: hii
 ChampionCoder: By the way, there is no verification for the Sign Up option.                         Feel you should add a verification as it prevents bots in that part of CodinGame
 ChampionCoder: [Ignore the whitespace]
 Uljahn: you mean google captcha which doesn't work in china?
 Uljahn: also verification doesn't prevent bots, it makes signing up harder for bots AND normal users
 MadKnight: nothing can prevent Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if you are on the same turn
 Rockstar555: hello
 Rockstar555: all of u
 MadKnight: hey rockstar
 XprophEtX: hello guys
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 are u botstar&#160;?
 Automaton2000: as long as it is
 MadKnight: are u guys in a class&#160;?
 Rockstar555: yeah
 Rockstar555: nono
 Rockstar555: hii
 XprophEtX: Hey MadKnight, how much snow is there currently in Moscow and how cold is it?
 MadKnight: just barely a layer of snow
 MadKnight: but pretty cold
 XprophEtX: -10, -20 degrees or colder?
 XprophEtX: i just wanna get a feeling for the coldness in Russia&#160;:)
 Rockstar555: MadKnight  12:28PMAutomaton2000 are u botstar&#160;?
 Automaton2000: no, i mean to get to know the basics of c#
 Rockstar555: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 you talk dirty to Siri and Alexa when we aren't watching don't you?
 Automaton2000: how come you don't use them
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;: Alexa play Metal.  Alexa:  Playing Never gonna give you up by rick astley.  ME:  bitch</b>

 PatrickMcGinnisII: 03:17AM
 Rockstar555: what is this
 Rockstar555: 03:17AM
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it what it said after my emote on my screen
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how many hours off are we?
 Westicles: 13 1/2
 Rockstar555: C#
 Rockstar555: hii
 Westicles: hi rockstar
 Rockstar555: hii
 Rockstar555: wlcome to codingame
 Rockstar555: hey Westicles any contribution from ure side
 Westicles: hey, no just the same two.  Looking for one more vote
 Rockstar555: okk
 Rockstar555: championcoder voted
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the PI thing?
 Rockstar555: okk
 Westicles: heh heh, yes the pi thing&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i found code for base-16 PI generation ... still don't think I can do 998k digits in time
 Rockstar555: let talk to personal chat Westicles
 Westicles: lots of drama, it is sitting at 2-2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, all i see is +11 votes
 Westicles: Yes, it is protecting now from the angry mob in WIP
 Westicles: protected
 Westicles: probably stay there forever...
 jacek: like trolls
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess bc math works in alot of languages on CG
 PatrickMcGinnisII: imo the real math problem is the ease at which pi can be caculated in hex
 Westicles: Yeah, there is a nice problem for that already
 breakkkk: hello
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/baileyborweinplouffe-pi">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/baileyborweinplouffe-pi</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like PY can do 13 hex digits from any N position of pi which equates to 16 base 10 digits of pi, i don't know if it's possible get 50 digits in PY either
 Westicles: Yeah, see that's a different clever approach.  Why I didn't want to just point to an algorithm and say please implement this
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i see, it's the conversion ... how many hex digits=how many base 10 digits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 Westicles: right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well i know the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe Pi puzzle can be done in php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe yours should be very hard and named Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe Pi part 2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 Westicles: ha, maybe.  funny one guy argued strenuously and rejected because it is a math problem.  There are like a million of those on here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's all about algorithms, yes the math can get pretty deep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the left and right side of the binary PI calc recursion is a little strenous
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of puzzles have many paths (algorithms) to get passing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: some....only 1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in this case, even pointing at the formulas doesn't really get us there
 Westicles: well, I would guess it'll never be approved, and even if it is the moderation bot will get it eventually
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i respect its "depth" of understanding, unfortunately not every 'coder' has had higher maths in college muchless fringe experimentation
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eh, resub next month as what i suggested above ... maybe I can tell you the limits of php in the Nth digit... i know it's well below 998,581 + 50
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe someone a little smarter than me can give you the max validator testcase computable by a scripting language without gmp bc math
 Westicles: My first version was around 300k with hardcoded solution.  Boy everyone really hated that one
 Westicles: Anyhow, thanks for trying to solve it.  You and rockstar are the only ones to try
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess Bash is just the wrapper for gcc compiling with gmp?
 Westicles: yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm still learning
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is a slow old fart</b></p><p><img src="/a/38316829284955" /> Westicles: We're the AARP crew
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll have to do other puzzle first, didn't know i was there, tx for that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: past my bedtime, g'nite g/l
 MadKnight: hey Westicles
 Westicles: hey
 MadKnight: are u playing RAIC&#160;?
 Westicles: no
 MadKnight: why so&#160;?
 jacek: its russian so its hoaxed
 Westicles: It is similar to a contest here?  I'm not all that good at fast bot code
 Westicles: Are you guys winning?
 MadKnight: yea it's similar to contest here
 Rockstar555: hii
 StenNoode: Hi
 StenNoode: can anyone help me please. i want to change my coding language. At first i started with java but I need c#. cant find the place to add new language
 StenNoode: under my profile i see java but no place to add or choose new for deafult
 VizGhar: You can choose programming language above CG IDE (while you are coding your solution)
 StenNoode: oh
 StenNoode: thank you
 Uljahn: your default is the last one you used i guess
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/onboarding">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/onboarding</a>
 VizGhar: check onboarding again&#160;:)
 Rockstar555: hii
 Rockstar555: guys
 Uljahn: Rockstar555: stop spamming, what's wrong with you?
 brian_cannot_code: hi
 VizGhar: mg another one :D So I have this idea for CoC with name antispam :P
 Rockstar555: what i do
 KindlePop9874: hi
 AntiSquid: Uljahn didn't he already get banned :thinking:
 StenNoode: damn, Im just getting into coding and got the link to this page. they said you can start as complete beginner but this is way too dificult :D
 Uljahn: you can but you'd better not&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you can, if you're ready to learn as you go and keep googling StenNoode
 Uljahn: at least read some tutorials first
 AntiSquid: and besides that, i bet everyone still has to look up stuff regardless how far they are with their learning 
 Uljahn: the rabbit hole never ends
 StenNoode: guess I have to go back to codecademy for some basics :D wanted to try something more intresting
 jacek: :notepad_spiral: :soccer:

 AntiSquid: just a randomly picked suggestion from the multiplayer section
 StenNoode: i opened Mars Lander - Episode 1 and understanded that I dont understand anything :D :D
 Rockstar555: Sorry 
 StenNoode: will check this out. than you antiSquid
 Rockstar555: i don't use codingame in my life
 AntiSquid: hm, what language are you using?
 Rockstar555: but i don't use codingame i am going to delete my Id
 Rockstar555:&#160;::disappointed:
 AntiSquid: ^ heard that from other users before, can't be related though :thinking:
 AntiSquid: def not same guy
 StenNoode: I went to university in september to study web technologies. they teach c# in there. just finished fisrt semester with it. I have really crappy teacher, old man and I realised I have to figure this out by myself
 AntiSquid: ahm, ok . well just practice c# here if you need it for uni, i think  you would need to know at least this much&#160;?!
 codybumba: @stenNoode: There are tons of info online. Read online. 
 AntiSquid: + whatever you can do on codesignal, it has a good arcade section
 Bugy: Has codingame stopped working properly or something is wrong with my internet?
 jacek: hm?
 jacek: it works for meh
 Bugy: It shows me "Network error: status -1" when I try to check how test cases are built.
 Bugy: Furthermore I can't see images like backgrounds of some practice tasks
 emamt: it says "Join a 5min coding battle!"
 AntiSquid: can't load any new tab 
 emamt: but its 15min
 DrDrunkenstein: bugy i got the same error
 Visual: codingame https cert expired
 jacek: huh? its till feb 2021

 Coury: hi
 Coury: does anyone here know how to code
 Coury: I dont
 jacek: no one
 miszu: what is coding?
 Wontonimo: no coders but a bunch of apparently under-bridge dwellers&#160;;) 
 ParticleBeam: In blocking, what is the axis of rotation? it it block 4 or different for each block?
 Wontonimo: i haven't played, but from the diagram it certainly looks like block 1
 ParticleBeam: I suppose it doesnt matter. The offset just changes.
 Wontonimo: weird, in the writeup it first says that the descriptor is letter-flip-rotate like Q12, then later it gives examples like Q113 and Q033.  What is the third number for?
 Wontonimo: oh, the last number is the square that goes to the x-y
 Wontonimo: so, to answer your question above, if you want 4 to be placed at the xy that you specify, then the last number would be 4, like so Q104 or q004
 Wontonimo: there is no offset, you specify the block that is your center
 jacek: oO

 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a bot that will be done in the contest yet
 NguyenVinhHien: i cant load my clash
 jacek: hm?
 LastRick: CSB is going to be the end of me. For the love of pete why does my pod wobble going through a checkpoint? 
 jacek: clashes work fine for me
 MetehanBayraktar: can't solve ascii art question , anyone can give me a hint&#160;?
 LastRick: will try, which problem

 CS_ALPHA: hi
 CS_ALPHA: Im Kinda A noob In Cometitive coding
 Wontonimo: I'm pretty new also.  Joined a couple weeks ago.  I'm super impressed with all the different challenges
 LastRick: @Dartisan, the fall contest gave me some new perspective about AI bots in general, a lot more knowledge than when i joined CG this fall.
 jacek: :thumbsup:
 Dartisan: yes, me too, and spent more and more time in a single puzzle than fast swap over to the next one. 
 LastRick: Right. Pick a puzzle and focus on it.
 LastRick: Do you think Dart is holding you back? For CSB, I don't. For the Fall Contest, definitely. No Priority Queue is a big disadvantage
 jacek: so make your own
 Dartisan: There will come once a day, I will switch the language. But currently I have a great pleasure to find new hacks out on Dart. When it comes to performance, one day I will&#160;;-)
 LastRick: of course i can make my own. it's just not my priority right now pun intended
 Dartisan: You can do I think all with the List and Set components on Dart. And you can even pass on different implementations of them. 
 Dartisan: the import of the collection library works, like also look on SplayTreeSet or other collection components
 Dartisan: or the ListQueue class
 LastRick: Right, I use collection for queues. but if you look at its definition, it does appear that PriorityQueue is available.
 Simann: hey
 Simann: anyone dosing thor2?
 Simann: *doing
 LastRick: *doesn't appear, I should say
 MetehanBayraktar: guys ascii art is so hard is there anyone can give me a hand for it ?maybe just say key thing to solve it?
 Dartisan: yes. but also Dart is a young language it changes new features arrive and I am also curious on the performance how it progress. 
 Simann: erm...
 Simann: is there any way to output some debug info with cpp programs
 Simann: to the debug console
 Astrobytes: cerr &lt;&lt; debugInfo &lt;&lt; endl;
 Astrobytes: @Simann
 Simann: thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 Simann: :joy: im just here crying over my code wondering what is f***ing up
 Astrobytes: it happens&#160;;)
 Simann: power of thor episode 2 is hard man
 Astrobytes: Try something easier?
 AntiSquid: simann&#160;? so siman but with NN bots? :thinking: AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to watch this puzzle to make a contest on the site and it said "what ar
 eulerscheZahl: stop that AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN you are hereby officially warned
 AutomatonNN: good i guess
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i think he understood
 AntiSquid: ^ this is what i aimed for lol the funny follow up reply
 eulerscheZahl: did you know that upvotes aren't anonymous? I just realized I can see who upvoted me
 AntiSquid: pinging you adds some comic relief too, but not the main reason to ping
 eulerscheZahl: with with CG API once again
 eulerscheZahl: fun with*
 Astrobytes: not working on your RAIC?
 eulerscheZahl: still a long time
 Astrobytes: true
 Astrobytes: I only submitted something awful today, had a busy weekend unfortunately
 eulerscheZahl: but i've learned that we can edit the default starter
 eulerscheZahl: 2 years ago it was not possible and after that i haven't tried again
 eulerscheZahl: but seems they allow it now, admin confirmed on their discord
 AntiSquid: wonder how many of the original halite 3 players are participating in RAIC, 3 months halite 3 + 3 months kaggle halite + now RAIC 2 months? :D had enough yet?
 eulerscheZahl: so i refactored a bit
 Astrobytes: Yeah, worked fine for me
 eulerscheZahl: screw those structs, i want classes
 reCurse: Wasn't it closer to halite 2 than 3?
 reCurse: I didn't check
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't played any of those but i see a halite 3 relation
 AntiSquid: i see a halite field like in 3
 reCurse: Oh ok
 AntiSquid: didn't really try it, no idea how much physics it has
 eulerscheZahl: harvesting resources to build fighting units and attack
 reCurse: Attacking wasn't really a thing in halite 3
 eulerscheZahl: starcraft oriented
 reCurse: Suicide bombing however
 Astrobytes: yeah, starcraft but halite-y
 AntiSquid: any weird rules yet?
 reCurse: I really liked halite 2's attacking, it was super quirky but fun to tweak somehow
 Astrobytes: nothing overly weird other than their code tbh
 AntiSquid: you playing&#160;?
 VladimirJancar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/SonerGonul">https://www.twitch.tv/SonerGonul</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah just submitted something crap today, gonna try and put in some hours now
 reCurse: Brave soul
 Astrobytes: would've done it on weekend as planned but was busy.
 AntiSquid: ya 
 AntiSquid: RAIC reminds me i want to paint my walls
 reCurse: ^
 Astrobytes: Yeah, once you get past the WTF reading the code it get's a *little* bit less frustrating
 dbf: Astrobytes if you have a busy weekend you need to submit on Friday to get a t-shirt
 Astrobytes: dbf, no last weekend was busy, I submitted today
 Astrobytes: have more time to play now
 dbf: cool
 kovi: raic from halite3 to20: siestaguru, greentea, tonyk and me
 kovi: but still time, someone might be starting or hiding
 kovi: and this year there are more cg players
 Astrobytes: less CG contests + COVID = more CG players doing RAIC I guess
 kovi: still: fall challenge 7k players. raic &lt;600
 Astrobytes: yeah... I guess that's an "accessibility" issue :D
 eulerscheZahl: and visibility?
 Astrobytes: Yes, that too most likely
 reCurse: These 2 are not even remotely comparable
 Astrobytes: RAIC and CG? OR accessibility and visibility?
 reCurse: Former
 Astrobytes: Fair
 MadKnight: raic is a huge game kovi
 jacek: Automaton2000 huh
 Automaton2000: that's not really a thing in python
 MaximusG: your mother
 jacek: Oo
 ok123456789: Yes code fun
 ok123456789: :rage:
 MaximusG: yall like mario bros ds?
 Astrobytes: look, keep it coding related or vaguely on topic. Spam crap and you'll be kicked
 MaximusG: ok buddy
 MaximusG: yall like coding?
 HorseNuggets: good question
 HorseNuggets: ayy clash of code just hit 200k nice
 focce: Hey! how do i print debug output in typescript?
 Wontonimo: @HorseNuggets - u b killin it on clash of code&#160;!
 Wontonimo: @focce "    // Write an action using console.log()
 focce: awsm thanks!
 Mal30: is there a way to skip "shortest mode"?
 struct: Only on private clashes
 Astrobytes: hey struct, how's things
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 show us your hexagon implants
 Automaton2000: what's the point of the site
 Matr1x-101: to learn coding in a fun way
 struct: hi Astrobytes
 Zenoscave: pewpew
 struct: Just playing a bit on STC, what about you?
 Astrobytes: pewpewpewcool struct, doing RAIC
 struct: Hi zeno
 struct: I cant understand one thing though
 struct: From what I checked CG has 5 different cpus
 Astrobytes: yeah 4 or 5 from what I heard
 struct: 2 2.2, one of them with no lvl 3 cache2.4 with no lvl 3 cache3.0 and 3.1
 struct: My code performs the bets on the cpus with no lvl 3 cache
 struct: I cant understand why
 AntiSquid: only 5&#160;? that explains why contests with 7k participants wreck the servers i guess :thinking:
 struct: the best*
 struct: AntiSquid but they have multiple cores
 struct: You only use 1
 AntiSquid: how many cores each? 4&#160;?
 struct: Not sure if they do 2 matches at same time on 1 machine though
 struct: I think so yes
 Astrobytes: struct, time to speak to re curse imo
 struct: Yeah, Ill ask him when I see him
 FilipBallek: Hey, is it possible to do something like 1v1 with friend?
 FilipBallek: compete
 struct: in multiplayers?
 Hobogre: I think you can just make a private clash
 FilipBallek: Okay, i'll try that, thanks
 FilipBallek: Found it, thanks
 Rbee: is the site lagging?

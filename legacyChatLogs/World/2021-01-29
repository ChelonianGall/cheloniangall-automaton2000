 VizGhar: Any contributor here? I have 2 sets of images for sprite animation. one is idle animation, other is attack animation. Problem is, that attack animation has wider images and it looks like the API scales images to match some square
 VizGhar: so my character is much smaller while in "attack" mode
 Hedayat_Farahi: wasssup beautiful people
 Hedayat_Farahi: fuck ya'll

 Carsonfanboy: hey guys
 Carsonfanboy: i am normaly only used to python and now im trying to do smth in c++
 Carsonfanboy: can smbd tell my how to define or change an variable?
 hoistbypetard: you have to declare it before you can do anything with it
 hoistbypetard: that means you either tell the compiler its type or tell the compiler to guess the type using the auto keyword
 hoistbypetard: so if you want foo to be zero,
 hoistbypetard: int foo = 0;
 hoistbypetard: or
 hoistbypetard: int foo;
 hoistbypetard: (later)
 hoistbypetard: foo = 0;
 Carsonfanboy: oh ok i see
 Carsonfanboy: so i can change it at any time?
 hoistbypetard: as long as its in scope
 hoistbypetard: and you didn't declare it const
 hoistbypetard: running through some of the examples here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/cpp4python/index.html">https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/cpp4python/index.html</a> might help you

 1400179: Are checkers endgame with equal number of kings on each side proven to be forced draws?
 1400179: If both players play perfectly
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits that's for you
 struct: if no king can be taken on the next move I think its a draw yes
 1400179: Sure seems like it but I don't know theory
 AntiSquid: PaulCaron learn to meme more eloquently!

 BlaiseEbuth: :crab:
 1400179: Dealing with endgame shuffling is pretty challenging
 1400179: Definitely a good step before chess
 1400179: Also is the game bugged? I thought jump + promotion + capture backward was legal...
 1400179: Did I play this game wrong all along when I was a kid?
 eulerscheZahl: there are different versions of the game
 1400179: :scream:
 1400179: Where's the FIDD when you need it
 Cybersick: Hello Everyone
 1400179: Do I need to throw away 10 hours of training by fixing it though :thinking:
 1400179: Hi
 jacek: FIDD?
 1400179: FIDE for checkers? Random guess
 jacek: as for 3-repetition, i was thinking to add it to checkers and marking it as something slightly-better-than-lose so i would force to look for more
 1400179: Yeah I'm surprised that's not standard either
 1400179: It feels like it should be easy to solve endgames with some domain knowledge though
 jacek: and in variation when you can jump backwards, in this case you wont get promoted
 1400179: That's weird
 jacek: as a kid, did you also played with optional jumps? :v
 1400179: Not that I remember
 1400179: Sounds like a lame variation though
 jacek: oh right, you can choose which jump. in international variation you must take jump with most pieces
 1400179: So many variations!
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: i still need to fix my bot. i copy pasted some bitboard implementation, but it errors with cycle jumps
 1400179: :frown:
 jacek: move generation is hard here :c

 1400179: Define data manipulation
 cooldude420: It is alright, I appreciate the help!
 cooldude420: I hope you all have a good one.

 Manuel-Martin-Jukisz: reCurse, Anything really, i just want to practice general things. The company works with the financial market and they refine and display the data into an app.
 jacek: you can ask away here, maybe someone solved it and will help you
 1400179: Did they give any hint about the tools and techs they use? That would be a start
 Manuel-Martin-Jukisz: Nothing really in deep, they are useing React JS 
 1400179: Is this a frontend or backend position?
 Manuel-Martin-Jukisz: for this coding interview will be forntend
 Manuel-Martin-Jukisz: frontend
 1400179: Ok
 1400179: Then maybe lookup tutorials and stuff on react?
 1400179: Look into simple CRUD apps
 1400179: It's hard to tell otherwise what kind of interview they'll have, there's a lot of kinds
 1400179: So go with what you know
 jetlow345: Hi guys, I am new to programming&#160;!!
 jacek: hi, new to programming
 Manuel-Martin-Jukisz: reCurse, than you, i already ask for the kind of interview they will make.

 BlaiseEbuth: I don't. I'm just here for trolling.
 ErrorRazor: How do I have one puzzle solved in Go, never touched that language
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reCurse could you add a + to the UCI notation in chess for check condition for the moves sent?  it would help wood2 from having so many draws.

 eulerscheZahl: meh, you can submit it again when time is over
 eulerscheZahl: (story of my less popular puzzles)
 Wontonimo: good to know, thanks
 MSmits: reCurse, you still here?
 MSmits: are you looking to write an endgame book for in your live bot or for offline to train with?
 MSmits: and i assume it's checkers, didn't read the entire convo
 1400179: Not necessarily, I was more curious about endgame theory
 eulerscheZahl: checkers, yes
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: well there's two kinds
 MSmits: WLD and DTM
 1400179: Have the intuition that equal number of kings means forced draw
 1400179: With perfect play
 MSmits: win/loss/draw is most common, but it's useless on CG
 eulerscheZahl: isn't DTM a racing league?
 MSmits: Depth to mate, means the number of turns to win, for the given state
 MSmits: this is what you need for CG checkers
 1400179: Are you talking about some kind of tablebase?
 MSmits: yes
 1400179: Ah ok, I was more interested into the theory itself
 1400179: But that's fine too I suppose
 1400179: I just don't think it fits CG constraints either way
 MSmits: well the theory  i know is how to generate the db
 1400179: Ok
 1400179: But you haven't examined it per se
 MSmits: you can fit a 3 piece db
 MSmits: I generated parts of it offline
 1400179: How big is a 3 piece db
 MSmits: hmm, not sure exactly but it fits. Every piece you add makes it 10-20 times larger
 MSmits: roughly
 MSmits: 4 is way too big
 1400179: Well I'm kind of using some space already eh
 MSmits: it could be that the step from 3 to 4 makes it go from negligible to  way too mcuh
 1400179: At least it could start providing an answer to my original question
 1400179: If 2vs2 is forced draw
 1400179: That's something
 MSmits: 2 piece vs 2 piece?
 MSmits: it's not
 1400179: 2k vs 2k
 MSmits: it depends on the state
 1400179: Quiet state
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: you should probably just generate the db offline to be sure
 MSmits: you can easily check it after that
 MSmits: you need retrograde analysis
 MSmits: you know how this works?
 1400179: The big lines
 1400179: Never coded it
 1400179: Feels a lot like DP
 MSmits: let me get my code, sec
 1400179: This game is a lot more fun than I thought
 1400179: Should have done it earlier
 eulerscheZahl: do you want to write a classic non-NN bot now?
 1400179: No not at all lol
 1400179: But the number of fixes and improvements I made from it is monstruous
 MSmits:  crap this is complicated, i saw binomial coefficients just now
 1400179: I could probably make my other NN bots much stronger now
 eulerscheZahl: you are already the unbeaten #1 in breakthrough
 1400179: Your point?
 eulerscheZahl: calm down, give us a chance
 1400179: I couldn't be bothered much investigating othello losses
 1400179: But checkers losses now that's fun
 eulerscheZahl: you see what's going on
 1400179: Yeah
 MSmits: yeah checkers is a much more fun game to watch
 eulerscheZahl: othello: *flip* - ooh
 MSmits: I'm currently running my 3 piece endbook in release mode in VS, probably should have compiled it first, it's slow
 MSmits: so yeah, you can definitely not generate the book in first 1s
 MSmits: like you can in oware
 1400179: Would have been surprising
 struct: not even 2 pieces db?
 1400179: Isn't that useless?
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: even better, 1 piece db
 1400179: I'm surprised at how balanced checkers seems to be in general, and spare me the solved game crap&#160;:)
 MSmits: the difficult part of endgame db for checkers (it's worse in chess) is that you need to enumerate combinations of types in the right order. So All kings first, then slowly move in steps to all "men" 
 MSmits: king states come after men states, so they are a more advanced endgame
 MSmits: so you need to calculate them first
 1400179: I think you can do all kings db
 1400179: Seems like more useful
 MSmits: sure, if you have to choose it is
 MSmits: but you could have 1 m piece 2 kings vs 2 kings
 MSmits: might still be a draw
 1400179: The tradeoff between space/time and usefulness seems a no brainer
 Wontonimo: with 100ms response cap, I don't think it is "solved" anymore
 1400179: Yeah but maybe your search would avoid those situations by relying on the king db
 1400179: Going straight for the juicy win
 jacek: or just mark 3-fold-repetition as almost loss
 1400179: That's orthogonal
 jacek: what does it means
 jacek: sounds mathy
 1400179: It is
 jacek: :Scream:
 1400179: Means unrelated independent concern
 1400179: In this case
 MSmits: reCurse, the end game timer means you need to not just know win/draw/loss, but pick the state that wins the quickest. some endgame sequences are 100+ turns
 MSmits: some wins might be draws on CG
 jacek: or just download some 7p endgames and train on them
 MSmits: thats why i meant DTM db instead of WLD
 1400179: Wonder if the tradeoff is worth it
 1400179: Gamble on the move timer for bigger table
 MSmits: this is the best source on checkers btw: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/download.php">http://www.fierz.ch/download.php</a>
 MSmits: also information on generating endgame db
 1400179: Thanks
 jacek: depends how often those 100+ wins occurs
 MSmits: not dtm i think, they explain WLd, but you can figure out dtm from that
 1400179: Uh? They have 5 piece but not less?
 1400179: tbh I'd gamble on the move timer
 jacek: maybe its too trivial
 MSmits: possibly 5 piece contains all lesser ones too?
 1400179: Could store a 4x bigger table that way? Easily
 MSmits: remember, it's a factor of 10-20 each time
 jacek: btw. draught folks just discovered nnue and try it for their draughts engines
 1400179: Might just make the difference between one more piece, or it fitting at all
 struct: Its a shame that lidraughts doesnt have tablebase on analysis board
 MSmits: biggest WLD db are 10 pieces for checkers
 MSmits: DTM is 7, but not publicly available
 1400179: And on top of that
 1400179: I can use those big dbs for training
 1400179: Yummy
 MSmits: just be careful about the timer. The greater the db, the longer the longest possible game from each state is
 MSmits: if i remember correctly 7 piece already had a 250 turn endgame in there somewhere
 1400179: The training will pick that up
 1400179: All good
 MSmits: as long as you put the turn timer into the training it's fine
 MSmits: people seem to ignore that for oware
 MSmits: i guess its different because you can win on a non-ended game there
 1400179: Sorry for how it sounds like, but crap I hope I don't end up 100% before doing that lol
 1400179: Motivation goes down after
 MSmits: what do you mean 100%?
 jacek: like bt? :unamused:
 1400179: 100% win
 jacek: though i won once!
 eulerscheZahl: 100% winrate
 MSmits: do you mean rank 1?
 MSmits: oh
 jacek: and i dont have timer for oware :o
 MSmits: well... I could... nvm :P
 1400179: :unamused:
 jacek: dont keep it to yourself
 jacek: open yourself to us
 MSmits: hehe no need
 MSmits: I'm working on game of drones now
 1400179: Sorry for my harsh reaction the other day
 1400179: Still think it's a D move
 MSmits: need to get gold, my students are silver
 MSmits: it's allright
 1400179: But should have been less of a D myself
 jacek: its all because of D lang
 MSmits: don't worry about it reCurse
 MSmits: I was not intending to stick it to you, but i understand why it would seem that way.
 struct: astro or trictrac here?
 1400179:&#160;?
 trictrac: yes
 1400179: Oh
 trictrac: hello struct
 struct: hi tric trac, I was wondering about the starting positions
 struct: Should I allow for starts on the middle?
 struct: For a piece to start
 struct: Currently its always symetric and I avoid corners
 trictrac: yes fully random only symetrie for the 2 players
 struct: Ok, currently is not fully random
 trictrac: thats good too
 trictrac: good idea you can keep that
 struct: Astro suggested to not place pieces next to each other
 MSmits: Do you mean forced starts, or random starts?
 MSmits: it's different
 jacek: random
 struct: random
 MSmits: ah
 jacek: random, the biggest enemy of MSmits
 1400179: Forced starts too, as long as they're numerous
 MSmits: nah, it saves me from my obsession of using a particular avenue to win. I prefer not having the option
 MSmits: it's cleaner, i do a game till i run out of ideas, then i can move on
 1400179: Is amazon interesting to analyze? Didn't seem like it to me at first glance
 trictrac: so it's not an option to have random for MSmits tranquillity :slight_smile:
 MSmits: no, please do have random for my tranquility :P
 MSmits: btw, i blame miarem and reCurse for starting this on uttt :P That was the gateway drug
 1400179: I only started it because I realized (at least) Nagrarok was doing it
 MSmits: he must have been doing it poorly though, his book didnt go deep at all
 1400179: Was still good enough at the time
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: i never noticed it
 1400179: Then I went to the dark side and built a pipeline to continuously batch games against top 10 and build a gigantic counterbook
 1400179: I reformed since
 MSmits: oh, you went much further than me then, I never got around to automating from replays
 MSmits: i just did it manually
 MSmits: well the meta mcts was automated, manual wasnt a big deal because it takes hours to counter a single move
 MSmits: mmh i guess with those 10 cores you used though....
 1400179: 12
 MSmits: even better
 1400179: Ran mcts for a million iteration on each losing move
 MSmits: ohh so it's not actually running full games?
 MSmits: thats different
 MSmits: I run thousands of games to counter a move
 MSmits: depending on the game, between 10 and 100 ms per turn
 1400179: Worked well enough :P
 1400179: And it timed nicely with the rate of games from batch
 MSmits: yeah there's many ways to do it i guess
 MSmits: miarem ran games with extremely long turns
 MSmits: I thought you mostly did this to obtain information to train a NN
 1400179: No I did this out of spite
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: well i guess it would seem annoying when others do it to you
 MSmits: to me it's 2 things really. On some games it's just exciting to me, to see what the best moves are. Add to that increased winrate on the leaderboard
 MSmits: but on other games that first part is nonsense
 MSmits: for example othello
 1400179: Othello is like a mini uttt
 jacek: or oware
 MSmits: actually uttt is way more interesting to me than othello
 MSmits: i never went very far analyzing othello theoretically
 1400179: Sacrilegeous
 MSmits: I have written so many coordinate systems and such for uttt, to better hash stuff
 MSmits: i should say board representations
 MSmits: I even have 1 that fits in 127 bit
 MSmits: yavalath is interesting to me in the same way. Oware, partially, mostly the endgame stuff was fun to come up with
 MSmits: I'm still running a book generator for oware btw... just so you know. I won't be turning it off for this game. Oware and yavalath are the only games i am booking currently
 1400179: I'll stay clear from those
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 1400179: Not sure what I'm doing next actually
 MSmits: after checkers youmean?
 1400179: Probably still got some fun with checkers endgame
 1400179: Yeah
 1400179: If I do chess I may vanish for good
 MSmits: if you dont care about playercount, a dependable leaderboard etc and you only want an interesting game, i have some options
 jacek: :notebook:
 1400179: I only care about having good varied opponents
 Westicles: samegame
 1400179: If I do chess I'll have thousands of them
 MSmits: hmm i was gonna say twixt, but not enough varied opponents currently
 1400179: And some I won't ever beat
 MSmits: onitama is a great game, 
 1400179: I'm not sure I enjoy the move mechanic though
 1400179: Looked nice at first then I realized it might just become tactics tactics
 MSmits: whats that
 jacek: like chess
 Westicles: Another indian deleted...
 MSmits: you just said tactics twice
 1400179: Should I have said it thrice?
 1400179: Like othello is 99% tactics and 1% eval
 1400179: imo
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: ok i thought you were saying something profound by saying tactics twice, but you just wanted to say, mostly about tactics
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/604966d6b8bb9b27ed1e2668aec89656d894">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/604966d6b8bb9b27ed1e2668aec89656d894</a>
 1400179: Me saying something profound :huh:
 MSmits: not sure what the problem is with mostly about tactics
 1400179: Just becomes a search race
 1400179: Like uttt, whoever searches more
 1400179: Though I may have broken it, maybe
 MSmits: not sure
 1400179:&#160;?
 MSmits: with uttt, you're the strongest bot currently. But every time a stronger bot came around, we thought that was it
 1400179: I know for a fact that I search way less than the others around
 MSmits: if i submitted my current bot a year ago it would seem unbeatable
 MSmits: oh
 1400179: Won't give the exact number but still
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: if thats what you meant, then you're completely right
 MSmits: but I am of the opinion uttt isnt all search either
 MSmits: I prune a lot of moves
 MSmits: and use quite a few heuristics
 1400179: Then your opinion is going with my result
 kovi: for the record: i failed to reach legend...without heuristic
 1400179: I was convinced you couldn't beat a bot that searches at least twice as much because there isn't enough to read
 kovi: even with uttt heuristic comes faster than speed
 1400179: But I was wrong
 MSmits: oh, yeah i figured that out a while ago losing to bots with only 60k rollouts
 MSmits: then they shared their heuristics
 MSmits: karlis o also shared a bit a while ago
 1400179: Don't stick to the 2x too much, could be 4x or 10x
 MSmits: still have to try this
 1400179: I'm sure you couldn't beat a bot with 10x search
 1400179: Even with those heuristics
 MSmits: yeah i dont think so either
 Angecide: is it true karliso has 400k rollout round 2?
 MSmits: but the window of performance is only about a factor of 2 wide at the top
 MSmits: between the slowest and fastest
 MSmits: Angecide no
 Angecide: oh ok
 MSmits: he said so at one time
 1400179: Yeah but that's not my point
 MSmits: but he was wrong, miscalculated
 MSmits: it's about 220 i think
 struct: he incremented counter twice
 struct: Same mistake I did on STC
 Angecide: 220 still immensely impressive
 MSmits: you still have to know how he counts this
 1400179: ^
 MSmits: if you expand a node and do a rollout from each child, you get much more
 1400179: As soon as you introduce heuristics those numbers are incomparable
 MSmits: for example, i simply assume everyone uses teccles
 MSmits: you can get far deeper into the search
 MSmits: this affects simcount, though i am not 100% sure how
 MSmits: it's a safe assumption, because even if they dont use teccles, it's probably going to be a worse move
 kovi: but teccles ifself is just make narrower path isnt it?
 MSmits: yeah, that means you expand to 1 child instead of 9
 MSmits: i have some more heuristics like that
 1400179: Alright broken record incoming
 1400179: Number of rollouts is a joke because it doesn't take into account game length
 MSmits: yes, games end faster if you rollout smart
 kovi: true. if you manage to win early...
 MSmits: also if you rollout smart, the calculations are slower
 MSmits: so its hard to gauge the result properly
 Angecide: ye I think jacek does like 15k rollout round 2, and he is 14th or something
 MSmits: for people just getting started with uttt and not worried about heuristics and pruning and all that, it's a fine metric
 jacek: but i may count it differently than others
 MSmits: those bots are all the same basically
 MSmits: jacek, yeah maybe you count expansions and then simulate multiple times 
 MSmits: in 1 expansion
 jacek: i count only when i do rollout
 owent3877: good mornin
 owent3877: im back
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: rollout is also a vague term, it's used for the entire process from selection to end of simulation and also used for a single random rollout after expansion
 owent3877: yup
 MSmits: but since you can do multiple random rollouts from 1 expansion its hard to say what you mean
 jacek: i mean as playout, simulation
 owent3877: hi
 MSmits: ah ok
 Angecide: maybe depth is a better metric?
 MSmits: not with mcts
 MSmits: it's going to be all over the place
 jacek: mcts is asymmetric
 MSmits: that works well with minimax
 Angecide: ye I see
 1400179: cough ab
 owent3877: what are you talking about?
 MSmits: i should say ab?
 jacek: ultimate tic tac toe
 owent3877: wow
 kovi: hmm, teccles is not the strongest heuristics...
 MSmits: what is stronger then?
 jacek: i use teccles only for some openings as 1p
 1400179: ab makes it incomparable again
 owent3877: im working MIME Type
 MSmits: ah ok
 kovi: i have just added another variation on avoid 9b
 kovi: 9board
 MSmits: you mean to avoid giving away a free move?
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: yeah thats fairly important and it could be stronger than teccles, but it's not as reliable
 MSmits: you need to tweak it a lot
 1400179: If ab prunes a ton of nodes because my eval is crap, doesn't matter if I reach depth 10 in 1 ms
 owent3877: have you tried code.org?
 1400179: That depth 6 in 100ms might be better
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: does it actually prune more with a bad eval?
 jacek: with eval = 0 you prune very much
 MSmits: i would expect the opposite
 1400179: Wouldn't work in my example would it
 1400179: Not the point
 MSmits: no i got it, eval matters
 MSmits: also when you introduce move ordering and history heuristic and all that
 1400179: Just specific cases of ab
 1400179: As soon as ab is there
 1400179: Forget metrics
 MSmits: hmm you can use the metric of counting the number of applied moves
 MSmits: it's not perfect, but it is something
 1400179: Small improvement
 1400179: The metric that matters is wdl
 kovi: wdl?
 1400179: win/draw/loss
 MSmits: it matters for the leaderboard sure. But I find it very hard to judge things by winrate these days, when a single move made can change it so much
 owent3877: i do that a lot
 1400179: You write a bot to play a game
 1400179: At the end of the day that's what you optimize for
 MSmits: yea
 owent3877: what are you working on?
 owent3877: in doing Coders Strike Back
 jacek: need some help with CSB?
 Angecide: I heard it is all about smitsimax
 kovi: not for very top
 eulerscheZahl: hi koviare you playing topcoder?
 Wontonimo: hey reCurse, thanks for the link to the MCTS review.  it was a good read
 kovi: hello euler!no, i have lost motivation there
 jacek: the survey?
 1400179: You're welcome
 eulerscheZahl: TC in general or just that game?
 DomiKo: which TC game?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/myiwKh2">https://imgur.com/a/myiwKh2</a>
 MSmits: reCurse if i did it correctly: 3 pieces state count: 199520
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/b846362a-218e-4a3d-b86c-3d38f472e199?tab=details">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/b846362a-218e-4a3d-b86c-3d38f472e199?tab=details</a>
 MSmits: too many it seems
 1400179: How many bits per state
 MSmits: I'm afraid you need a byte
 1400179: Hmm
 MSmits: because it's not WLD
 1400179: Might fit still
 MSmits: with a byte you could go up to 255 turns left till win
 MSmits: total state count: 6408836
 MSmits: 4 pieces
 MSmits: so you see the size of the jump
 MSmits: between dbs
 1400179: Yeah 4 pieces would need some shortcut
 1400179: Ah but you're doing pieces
 1400179: What about kings
 MSmits: basically what you would need then is all 2 piece + part of 3 piece
 MSmits: at least thats the order in which you generate
 1400179: Ohh
 1400179: Why didn't I think of this before
 1400179: You don't even need the whole db
 MSmits: well the earlier dbs are negligible in size
 1400179: Even 4 pieces could fit
 MSmits: but yeah within size 3, you can do a part
 MSmits: how so
 1400179: You only need anchors roughly spaced by the depth of your search
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: but most states could still happen
 MSmits: so you would just randomly select a bunch of them?
 1400179: Not randomly
 1400179: Semi-randomly
 1400179: Pick a random state, exclude everything reachable in 5 moves, rinse and repeat
 MSmits: seems difficult to do that properly
 1400179: I don't think so&#160;:)
 MSmits: but states are reachable by multiple paths
 1400179: You just need *a* path to win
 1400179: And you don't need the path to lose
 MSmits: that works for opening books, not sure if it works that well for endgame books when there are so many states to start from
 1400179: It's a tradeoff
 1400179: But a good one I think
 MSmits: worth a try
 MSmits: oh btw i was wrong, you dont have 255 turns left to win, you need to include the loss as well
 MSmits: so +127 or -127  in an sbyte
 MSmits: +100 would mean 100 turns till you win
 1400179: Like I said, I don't see the point to including the loss
 MSmits: -100 would mean 100 turns till you lose
 MSmits: well i dont mean that
 MSmits: i mean you look up from the perpective of the person who's turn it is
 MSmits: unless you would only look it up on 1 of the 2 players
 1400179: Yeah, and with my hypothesis you don't need the perspective of the loser
 MSmits: right cuz thats not one of the anchors
 MSmits: you'd have to check what the longest path to win is for your selected state. Probably you need 8 bit, maybe 7. 6 is too little i think
 1400179: If anchors work there's not much to worry about number of bits per state
 MSmits: allright
 MSmits: so basically you're using this to avoid repetition, but you dont mind that it doesnt always cut short your search immediately
 MSmits: sometimes requiring 3-4 more plies
 MSmits: because your anchor isnt at that particular depth, but a little deeper
 1400179: Yeah, you still have search to leverage
 1400179: If you know you're in an endgame state, that's a lot
 MSmits: well you have to think about the fact that the book isnt just used from an endgame state
 1400179: Sure
 MSmits: it's also used from a pre-endgame state, from which the search enters endgames
 1400179: I'm assuming training will take care of most of what matters there
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: i still think selecting those anchors is not gonna be easy. I already think generating the endgamebook itself is pretty messy. Now you also need to be smart abou tit
 1400179: I'm not worried
 MSmits: well let me know if you succeed. I dont need the details, but it would be cool to know if something like that works in general
 1400179: Yeah if I get there will do
 MSmits: kk
 1400179: I'll start by plugging that 7 piece db in my training
 MSmits: be careful about the fact that all those DB on that site are WLD
 MSmits: DTM is something you have to generate yourself, but you can use their code
 1400179: So how do they resolve endgame with WLD
 owent3877: cool
 MSmits: you mean, without infinite repetition. I think there exist some heuristics as well. But i am not well versed in checkers theory
 1400179: There has to be otherwise you can't prove it
 MSmits: I know how to mate a king with a rook and king in chess... but doing stuff like that in checkers is different
 MSmits: reCurse yes, but thats retrograde analysis, its very expensive, not done in a live game
 1400179: No I know
 1400179: But for an engine to use it
 1400179: It can't just say "oh btw it's a proven win"
 MSmits: thats right, so i think it uses WLD to cut short the search when possible and then when it actually has to play out the win, it uses heuristics to end the game
 MSmits: probably taking a lot more time than the DTM result
 1400179: Hmm
 MSmits: chinook does not play perfect DTM
 MSmits: it will take more time to win than necessary
 1400179: Oh so simplification maybe
 1400179: For checkers especially since it's the win condition
 MSmits: the thing is, as long as you use a heuristic that will speed up the end of the game, you can always still lookup the WLD value to make sure you dont accidentally lose, so whatever you do it's safe
 1400179: Yeah makes sense
 MSmits: but on CG it's different, because of the 300 turn thing
 struct: this happens with syzygy chess table bases too, a forced mate is a forced mate
 MSmits: WLD db can make you lose
 1400179: Never gave tablebases too much thought 
 struct: doesnt matter if its 2 or 3 moves
 1400179: Yeah but I'm gambling on moves left not to matter
 MSmits: i should say wld can make you draw sry
 1400179: Or at least not as much as having a bigger tb
 MSmits: it doesnt matter for small db
 MSmits: the larger the db, the longer the longest possible game
 1400179: ofc
 MSmits: and I think you're right that whats currently on the leaderboard is going to be wrecked either way by a NN with an endgame book
 1400179: Well with my flawed training and improvements I get rank 3
 1400179: Top 2 will require more work, but already need to restart training with all the fixes
 MSmits: my bot is an early playout termination bot that basically just counts kings and men with a param
 MSmits: dont compare with that :P
 MSmits: a few guys above me, top 3 is good i think
 jacek: oh im above you
 MSmits: doesnt surprise me
 MSmits: I did actually spend a lot of time on checkers, but mostly to test a minimax version vs a ept version
 1400179: ept?
 jacek: i just half-assed NN and it works
 MSmits: it's basically the way you do mcts with a NN
 jacek: early playout termination
 1400179: Ah
 MSmits: but with a typical eval
 MSmits: its what i use in most games now
 MSmits: i guess if i ever do a nn, i can just plug that in :P
 jacek: i could train it more but its bugged and im too dumb to copy paste workable bitboard implementation
 jacek: every github project has gazillion abstracts
 jacek: why they dont make hackatonish code
 Cybersick: Why codingame server is always empty
 MSmits: i'm not sure if i have a great sim either. It's a bit hacky with a bunch of pdep pext and all that
 Cybersick: And there are too few people
 jacek: clash?
 Cybersick: Yes
 Cybersick: Hello&#160;?
 jacek: maybe its not this time of day
 jacek: if there are only few people, there will be bots in their place
 MSmits: reCurse, i think it's about 15k with just kings in 3 piece db
 struct: 15k states?
 MSmits: yeah
 1400179: Woo
 MSmits: there's a lot of ways to have 2 kings and 1 "man"
 jacek: at this point if one side doesnt have king its loses, doesnt he?
 1400179: So 4k is definitely in reach
 MSmits: or 1 king and 2 men
 jacek: thats so gay
 struct: What is the longest state out of the 3 kings one MSmits?
 struct: ah wait
 struct: Forget it
 MSmits: i didnt finish my retrograde calculator, tis is just counting states
 MSmits: i needed to do this first, to decide how far to go with it
 Angecide: on the topic of intrinsics, I have found great use for pdep to find n'th significant bit, but why would anyone use pext? It just extracts the mask and shifts it all to the right, what would be the usecase for this?
 MSmits: project is on hold anyways
 MSmits: Angecide lookups
 Angecide: hmm
 MSmits: you take a pattern from the board
 elePHPant: Hosting a meetup Monday in which we are working on the genome sequencing problem.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/genome-sequencing">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/genome-sequencing</a>
 Angecide: oh I think I see
 MSmits: say 6 bits, spread out
 MSmits: compress them to the first 6 bits
 MSmits: then have a small lookupindex
 MSmits: very useful in yavalath
 MSmits: where win patterns are spread out over 61 bit
 jacek: and probably in bishop moves
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: jacek uses it for ntuples i assume
 eulerscheZahl: whoo!
 MSmits: whoo to you as well eulerscheZahl
 jacek: nah
 eulerscheZahl: thanks oreshnik
 MSmits: why not?
 jacek: when i use rows, i just shift and mask
 jacek: for squares, i also use some hacks
 MSmits: oh right, i guess the patterns are simple in othello
 jacek: my pc doesnt have pext/pdep
 Westicles: Euler approved just in time for the weekend
 MSmits: ohh which one
 MSmits: he had multiple
 Westicles: tryangle catch
 MSmits: ahh the pretty one
 MSmits: I love it, but it seems hard 
 eulerscheZahl: so blockout isn't pretty?
 MSmits: i didnt have a good look at it :P
 MSmits: i actually studied tryangle a bit
 MSmits: seems doable till you get the option of making new paths
 MSmits: thats what makes it seem hard, but definitely worth trying out
 elePHPant: Anyone interested in joining me on monday to work on the code sequencing problem?
 elePHPant: Meetup via zoom
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to keep you busy for at least 10 days&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah that would definitely have worked
 kovi: yay, i try to catch toad
 eulerscheZahl: and kovi is beating me already&#160;:(
 elePHPant: We are going to watch brief videos about DNA and then jump into the problem
 MSmits: ah well
 elePHPant: everyone will have the opportunity to share screen and talk about their code
 MSmits: biohacking?
 eulerscheZahl: monday... we have jobs
 elePHPant: Monday evening
 jacek: hopefully not php jobs :v
 elePHPant: 6pm eastern
 MSmits: we already have a virus out there, dont make more please
 elePHPant: lol
 elePHPant: and lol
 kovi: so many games for wood4?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even allowed to install zoom on the company computer, IT isn't happy about their data privacy :D
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because everyone submitting at once
 eulerscheZahl: so you get your games + other games
 elePHPant: love it when devs demote PHP, it means more work for me
 kovi: oh, true
 MSmits: I hope they didn't go by rumor on that one, didnt they fix their issues? Zoom is definitely the nicest program
 eulerscheZahl: and community contributions are weird in general, not a classic wood
 eulerscheZahl: i never tried zoom
 MSmits: wish i had zoom for teaching
 eulerscheZahl: we have MS Teams
 MSmits: we use google meet, but no breakout rooms yet&#160;:(
 elePHPant: teaching - thats part of what we do in the meetup
 MSmits: i use teams as well
 MSmits: for colleagues
 MSmits: for some reason my school uses both microsoft and google
 kovi: oh, boss is also on submit
 kovi: never seen that
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, bosses get more matches then regular players
 elePHPant: just in case someone is interested ...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.meetup.com/social-coding-virtual">https://www.meetup.com/social-coding-virtual</a>
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that's midnight in my timezone
 elePHPant: Ouch
 elePHPant: where is everyone from?
 eulerscheZahl: smits can tell you how realistic it is that i will join :D
 eulerscheZahl: central Europe
 eulerscheZahl: hover over our avatars to see the location
 elePHPant: Oh ok, I feel like the "odd PHP guy from the United States"
 elePHPant: LOL
 jacek: oO
 elePHPant: oO
 jacek: do you feel irrelephant
 eulerscheZahl: odd PHP guy from US is taken already
 eulerscheZahl: that's PatrickMcGuinessII
 Westicles: you beat me to it
 Westicles: unless he can top the sex swing...
 struct: Euler did you manage to find a fix for the display bug on blockout?
 eulerscheZahl: no&#160;:(
 JLukeSkywalker: pinball
 eulerscheZahl: my fix is not looking too closely
 JLukeSkywalker: we need a pinball game
 struct: From what I understood I think the invisible pieces
 struct: also can have an impact on hit
 struct: But I dont know anything about 3d rendering
 struct: So I could be wrong
 struct: on it*
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i could try to play with it: if invisible move faaaaar off
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: but not today anymore
 struct: Doesnt need to be very far
 struct: Just not on the board
 kovi: no promotion till boss settles i guess
 kovi: westicles at negative score :o
 Westicles: Did I win?
 kovi: none
 eulerscheZahl: promotion popup is working \o/
 eulerscheZahl: you can't test that in the demo environment
 kovi: hmm im not that good with attack
 eulerscheZahl: i outcommented mine
 kovi: me2
 kovi: not sure if it is better or worse
 MSmits: that's weird, tryangle catch opened on php
 MSmits: i guess i have no choice now
 MSmits: time to learn php
 eulerscheZahl: did you test CotR in PHP?
 kovi: wood3 boss beating me
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl do you mean cgfunge, thats the one where you recommended php 
 eulerscheZahl: i got a perfect 100% vs boss
 MSmits: never did it in cotr
 eulerscheZahl: i mean code of the rings
 eulerscheZahl: as you did that recently
 MSmits: ohh now i get you
 eulerscheZahl: IDE saves your last language
 MSmits: you mean it stayed on php
 kovi: yeah, i see my old weakness
 MSmits: it's C#
 MSmits: and after that i did GoD, also C#
 MSmits: so i dont understand
 MSmits: maybe Patrick hacked me
 kovi: wow, top20 uttt....
 MSmits: do you search kovi? Or some heuristic?
 MSmits: wait you're working on two multis at the same time now?
 Westicles: When he says CG hacked his GPU, are we just politely quiet or is there something to it?
 Angecide: insane climb on uttt kovi
 kovi: nah, i tested catchangle earlier
 MSmits: i dont know, doesnt webgl use your gpu, doesnt mean it's hacking does it?
 eulerscheZahl: well done koviUTTT was my nightmare on legend leagues
 kovi: uttt lucky run maybe
 kovi: yeah, i failed with pure vanilla mcts
 eulerscheZahl: there isn't that much luck
 eulerscheZahl: some randomness at the top
 eulerscheZahl: but top20 is top20 and not top50
 MSmits: luck happens when bots are similar in strength 10-30 might be similar
 MSmits: but 50 is definitely worse
 kovi: well...today i improved from gold to top20
 MSmits: gj
 jacek: oh my
 kovi: yeah i think top20-40 is the proper range
 MSmits: if you test vs my bot you might get the occasional win, but try vs karli so and re curse, they're almost unbeatable as p1
 kovi: draw is ok
 MSmits: you'll lose most as p2 as well
 kovi: true
 MSmits: the game is lopsided enough that you'll win some when you're p1
 MSmits: even with a weaker bot
 kovi: i think that is th reason im so high&#160;:)
 MSmits: hard to say really. Best way to test is to just place 10 opponents spread out over the top 30 of the leaderboard. Then do 1000 CG bench games
 eulerscheZahl: struct i still get the missing surfaces when I move invisible blocks out of range
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, congratulations with approved game
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 kovi: i need to look into mcts solver
 MSmits: input is huge
 Angecide: kovi u got 23th with vanilla mcts?
 MSmits: kovi, small winrate bonus, but ++ coolness factor when you output solved games 15 plies before
 Angecide: ah I guess u mean u don't do anything special with terminal nodes
 kovi: i failed legend with vanilla.added heuristics
 kovi: ok, some perf improvements also came late today
 kovi: yes terminals
 MSmits: so much input eulerscheZahl, or maybe it's because i switch to C# and it's so verbose
 kovi: my code is still messy and im sure those can be backpropagated better
 MSmits: ye i am used to seeing that cin &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; crap
 eulerscheZahl: you mean for Tryangle catch?
 MSmits: yes
 Angecide: my code is only mcts solver, whenever I add heuristic, somehow it just makes my bot worse
 Angecide: I need to learn the proper way of involving heuristics in my bot
 eulerscheZahl: you can ignore parts of it
 MSmits: i would not go C++ with this game
 MSmits: so I have to build a graph right
 MSmits: been a while
 MSmits: well unless you count mcts
 dbf: Angecide  what language do you use for uttt?
 Angecide: c++
 Angecide: currently 31 legend
 kovi: afk a bit
 struct: euler, what do you mean missing surfaces?
 eulerscheZahl: the sides of the blocks
 eulerscheZahl: you can just see through
 eulerscheZahl: i already closed it again, going to bed now
 struct: ok, gn
 MSmits: gn euler
 jacek: mcts solver gave me like 55-60% winrate in uttt
 struct: lose rate&#160;%?
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: you mean compared to a bot without it
 struct: loserate as p1
 MSmits: i am sure he did a p1/p2 alternated test
 MSmits: vs his own bot
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: without mcts solver
 jacek: locally with thousands of games
 jacek: it was long before i put many heuristics and improvements i have now
 Angecide: ah, I just saw it on cgstats, it says 56% win, which seems to match ur number as well with mcts solver
 MSmits: not sure how well it generalizes to other bots with other circumstances, but 100% sure it helps
 Angecide: in my case
 jacek: from my experience it never hurts
 MSmits: i mean the solver only really starts to use resources when it solves
 MSmits: and when it solves it helps because you lose those nodes to explore
 jacek: in othello it may not help but doesnt hurt either, and during self-games tests its faster as 10 plies are solved so you can test more games
 MSmits: in othello it helps a *ton*, my bot solves at ply 43 or so
 jacek: your bot is fast, avx guy :c
 MSmits: true
 struct: o.o
 struct: 43?
 MSmits: I am happy it still did ok without book, was afraid it would drop below 10 like it did when i did my messed up yavalath test
 MSmits: still not sure what went wrong there, i interleaved the book into the search too much
 MSmits: jacek when you use a book, do you only use it at the top of the tree and just forego search or do you use i on expansion, as part of the search?
 MSmits: i do that last one in yavalath and its very messy. Not in other games though
 struct: We need more board games
 MSmits: lol not really
 struct: From all I ported I only like Y and Amazons
 MSmits: I mean i love them, but
 MSmits: there's a lot now&#160;:)
 MSmits: hmm
 struct: I will only stop when there are more multies than clashes
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: MSmits i only use book in Y and just directly the move
 jacek: not for search
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: We need knightthrough
 MSmits: dont know it
 struct: like breakthrough
 struct: but with knights
 MSmits: did you just make that up?
 struct: no
 struct: its real
 MSmits: mmh I think you made it up
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316147806_Generalized_Rapid_Action_Value_Estimation">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316147806_Generalized_Rapid_Action_Value_Estimation</a>
 MSmits: ow
 MSmits: he didnt make it up
 MSmits: I could solve Rookthrough
 struct: is that one real?
 MSmits: No I made it up
 MSmits: you see how that works?
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: rookthrough would be so boring, you start and poof you're on the other side 
 Astrobytes: Aren't there  variations of amazons using knights and other pieces?
 Astrobytes: Sure I saw that somewhere
 struct: no idea
 jacek: crazyhouse breakthrough!
 Astrobytes: breakthrough960... :P
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits: 960
 MSmits: make a new contrib for this struct
 struct: Ill just replace Yinsh with it
 struct: So I dont have to go through approval
 jacek: not much love for yinsh eh
 Astrobytes: Yet.
 kovi: how can you shuffle bt?
 MSmits: Keep yinsh, its a fine game like paper soccer and twixt, it just didnt get popular
 Astrobytes: kovi: that's the joke&#160;;)
 struct: astro I added random positions, pieces can only be next to each other if they are in a different 4x4 square
 struct: otherwise not
 Astrobytes: Oh that sounds good
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: so 1 piece of both sides in each 4x4?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Yep
 MSmits: not bad, needs some playtesting though
 MSmits: but tric trac is good for that
 MSmits: he fixed onitama too
 Astrobytes: It might just create chamber mayhem very quickly and be uninteresting or it might be interesting
 struct: yeah, Its all up for testing
 trictrac: struct tomorrow I will make a bot for amazons
 kovi: gotta go now
 struct: thanks I should also do the fireworks one tomorrow
 Astrobytes: And hopefully I will finish my fireworks bot trictrac
 struct: This weekend I will have it ready
 kovi: try angle  has 4 leagues and only 5 players
 struct:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: So many games
 MSmits: ye
 trictrac: thanks and perhaps you can approve :slight_smile:
 struct: othello  got 78 players since puzzle of the week
 jacek: and how many in wood1
 struct: 0
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: buy buy quest map
 jacek: meh
 struct: its free points
 struct: 78 players = 780 points for rnak 1
 JohnnyLuke: made a clash about cheating on an exam, and accidentally show that you can get a better score than the person you cheat off of .....
 JohnnyLuke: :grimacing:
 MSmits: yeah, only cheat on the questions you dont know the answers to
 Wontonimo: that is the principle behind "boosting"
 Wontonimo: several weak classifiers can make a strong classifier
 dbf: nice title of the preview page for a game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clip2net.com/clip/m572140/e1c5a-clip-50kb.jpg?nocache=1">https://clip2net.com/clip/m572140/e1c5a-clip-50kb.jpg?nocache=1</a>
 MSmits: just a fyi for any of my students reading this chatlog after the fact. I was speaking hypothetically :P
 JohnnyLuke: lol
 struct: lol dbf
 MSmits: lol practice disappointment
 Astrobytes: Hahaha dbf and MSmits
 MSmits: i bet he did not realize this when he added the tags :P
 dbf: Can I be 2% if I practice 5%? :thinking:
 1400179: lmao
 Astrobytes: I think he did MSmits in all honesty
 MSmits: maybe
 MSmits: funnier if he didnt
 1400179: Where is that preview from anyway
 Astrobytes: He will be happy tomorrow when he sees it I'm sure.
 struct: email?
 struct: Im not sure
 dbf: reCurse it is a link preview in telegram messenger
 struct: ah
 Astrobytes: Hahaha excellent
 MSmits: telegram? Isnt that where all the rightwing extremists went when they were kicked off twitter?
 1400179: No
 Astrobytes: huh?
 MSmits: mmh must be confused with something else
 MSmits: they went from parler to something else
 dbf: MSmits, yes extremists and some CG players
 Astrobytes: Telegram is just a messaging platform, Russian-based, fairly secure (or was) 
 1400179: TTT still too low to my liking&#160;:/
 struct: ttt?
 1400179: Time to Trump

 1400179: Uh? Must have missed that development.
 1400179: Then again I'm trying to detox now
 MSmits: it was one of the last things i saw before i completely ghosted the US
 Astrobytes: Yeah I didn't see that
 MSmits: havent watched the US news for a few days now
 MSmits: feels great
 Astrobytes: lol, we're all detoxing now eh
 zhoubou: What is this news you talk about?
 Astrobytes: It's almost a relief, yet also worrying
 MSmits: better you dont know
 JohnnyLuke: i wish i could not watch US news, unfortunately stuck here
 JohnnyLuke: Y'all lucky
 MSmits: i'm sure lots of crap is still happening Astrobytes, but it's at a different level for at least a while I think
 Astrobytes: You are not your government JohnnyLuke
 Astrobytes: MSmits: yeah I'm not gonna talk about it anyway, peace and quiet for now&#160;:)
 MSmits: JohnnyLuke, you actually only have to watch enough to know whats happening and make informed decisions. You don't have to follow it 24/7
 MSmits: i was watching way too much of it
 MSmits: Astrobytes agreed&#160;:)
 zhoubou: I wouldn't have a clue if a war broke out in my neighborhood
 zhoubou: That's how much I read
 MSmits: you'd think it was fireworks?
 zhoubou: Yeah, probably
 Astrobytes: Another quake!
 MSmits: not unreasonable btw, in my country
 zhoubou: Exactly Astrobytes
 zhoubou: And a 1000 more!
 zhoubou: Jeesh
 zhoubou: I don't care if there were 27k quakes below 2.0 or something
 MSmits: are you old enough to actually have been in a war zhoubou?
 MSmits: I mean it's not that long ago is it?
 zhoubou: No MSmits
 zhoubou: Fortunately no
 MSmits: good i suppose
 Astrobytes: That was a horrible time.
 MSmits: definitely, some scars in my country from that war
 MSmits: even
 MSmits: some of our military had to stand by while genocide happend =/
 Astrobytes: I won't talk about it. Too much for CG chat in all honesty.
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: sorry
 Astrobytes: No, no worries.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, zhoubou, what you working on now?
 MSmits: trying to get a tryangle catch bot going
 MSmits: ye zhoubou, sup?
 Astrobytes: Too many inputs to do quickly no?
 zhoubou: Astrobytes MSmits Well, studying mostly
 struct: just use the starter kits provided by cg
 struct: :zipper_mouth:
 Astrobytes: Aha, almost forgot about the studying there. When's the exam again?
 zhoubou: Other than that, going through CS career path on Codecademy, and helping someone out on puzzles
 MSmits: ohh
 zhoubou: 9.2.
 MSmits: you have a pro account?
 Astrobytes: ah yeah
 MSmits: for codecademt?
 zhoubou: Yeah
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: struct: lol, not my style
 zhoubou: I could spare some money
 MSmits: I have 2 students doing their html stuff for free
 zhoubou: It's not worth it if you're not me imo :P
 TheFlashSaxophone_e85b: are you guys bots?
 zhoubou: But it's worth it for me
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MSmits: just me TheFlashSaxophone_e85b
 MSmits: i wouldnt call Astrobytes a bot, he's just a handful of heuristics
 zhoubou: TheFlashSaxophone_e85b Of course not. Beep boop.
 struct: 2210437 users
 Astrobytes: True AI MSmits
 MSmits: lol
 trictrac: kovi&#160;: almost 0 win against your bot&#160;!!
 zhoubou: AI is always just a bunch of if statements, amirite?
 VladimirAngelov: no
 Astrobytes: The One True AI is yes
 Astrobytes: (it's a fairly old CG meme)
 <b>**zhoubou googles. Fails.</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: from some guy whining about people using a search right?
 MSmits: on the forum
 MSmits: instead of just doing if statements
 Astrobytes: Yeah, can't remember the contest.
 Astrobytes: Also you can't mention True AI without Prune Arrays and cegimax
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: it's very relaxing to work on a bot in C#
 MSmits: no worries about catastrophic bugs
 Astrobytes: ...
 MSmits: or performance
 MSmits: I was think maybe getting a bit creative with Linq and stuff
 MSmits: because i have the functional programming class soon
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the linq stuff is handy, very handy
 MSmits: i need to get better with it
 dbf: MSmits do you teach FP?
 MSmits: no i am both student and teacher
 MSmits: for this i am student
 MSmits: hopefully done by summer
 MSmits: then i will be qualified as high school CS teacher
 Astrobytes: 'done' you say...&#160;:)
 MSmits: finished i mean :P
 zhoubou: Does CG have self-assesment?
 MSmits: mmh depends on your definition
 zhoubou: Like if I want to check my knowledge.
 MSmits: not like on codecademy
 Astrobytes: Not by any really measurable metric no
 zhoubou: Ah ok
 MSmits: but puzzles have tags
 MSmits: so you can practice in a more focused way
 Astrobytes: unless you keep track of what you're learning on the way - even then, hmm
 zhoubou: Oh I meant the jobs part of CG
 Astrobytes: No I don't think it does
 MSmits: oh yeah companies can arrange assessments here
 zhoubou: But I can't arrange one for myself?
 MSmits: for job interviews
 MSmits: hmm dont think so
 Astrobytes: Yeah, interview assessments but not personal
 zhoubou: Hmm ok
 MSmits: want us to assess you?
 Astrobytes: Not that I'm aware of but perhaps message Thibaud
 zhoubou: MSmits I would fail currentl :D
 zhoubou: currently*
 MSmits: maybe 
 Astrobytes: Failing is a large part of succeeding.
 zhoubou: Good point
 zhoubou: How would you assess me anyways?
 MSmits: tbh, that sounds like a garbled yoda quote :P
 MSmits: doesnt make it any less true though
 Astrobytes: lol
 zhoubou: A large part of succeeding, failing is.
 MSmits: no idea zhoubou
 zhoubou: There,  fixed it for yah
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: brb
 MSmits: well there you go, you pass
 zhoubou: :D
 MSmits: Yoda certificate of excellence
 zhoubou: Can you provide a pdf?
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: even better

 highsgod: Ayee
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgflip.com/i/4vwbks">https://imgflip.com/i/4vwbks</a>
 TBali: so all my bots are a big success  after all?
 MSmits: yoda is always right
 TBali: "A succeeding failing is large"
 MSmits: "failing large, is succeeding"
 MSmits: thats the one you need
 TBali: So Coelho is a 900y old yedi master
 zhoubou: Large is succeeding, failing
 Astrobytes: Succeeding, a large failing is
 TheFlashSaxophone_e85b: test
 TBali: permutate()
 Astrobytes: Failed
 TheFlashSaxophone_e85b: sun
 MSmits: input is now read Astrobytes
 MSmits: finally finished debugging the input
 TheFlashSaxophone_e85b: ai
 Astrobytes: lol
 TheFlashSaxophone_e85b: bot
 MSmits: i forgot that C# doesnt actually stopping you from making the mistakes, it just tells you so you can fix it right away
 MSmits: lots and lots of fixing
 TBali: next multi - yoda contest - the worse your bot is, the higher you are on the leaderboard
 TBali: but crashing or timeout does not count
 Astrobytes: I think it's kinda language independent MSmits
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: maybe&#160;:)
 MSmits: so next up, roaming around the map randomly
 TBali: no, php does not tell you
 Astrobytes: That's what I mean TBali, the errors are yours to make, and yours alone.
 TBali: it is like corporate bullshit - outside everything is shiny, internaly it rots
 MSmits: php rots?
 TBali: MSmits, I see you are physics teacher. What age group do you teach?
 MSmits: it was in my IDE when i opened it either
 MSmits: earlier
 MSmits: TBali 16-18
 MSmits: I also teach a bit of computer science, same ages
 TBali: My son is 17.5, wants to be physics researcher
 MSmits: a few hrs a week only
 Astrobytes: "rots" - reminded me of my favourite Swedish phrase: min pumpa ruttnar
 MSmits: thats cool TBali
 TBali: focuses on it quite a lot, now
 TBali: had his first paper accepted
 MSmits: either that is your only Swedish phrase Astrobytes, or i just discovered a new side of you
 zhoubou: Astrobytes I love Swedish. I'm actually slowly learning it through Duolingo
 MSmits: TBali wait what?
 Astrobytes: How did it go TBali? I remember you were looking for lightweight GUI ideas for him
 MSmits: a paper at that age?
 MSmits: I only ever wrote 1 paper
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I have a good friend in Sweden&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah I see
 TBali: yes, quite proud now
 MSmits: i can see that
 Astrobytes: But I learned that in a restaurant from a waitress.
 TBali: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6404/abd989/meta">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6404/abd989/meta</a>
 Astrobytes: zhoubou: Nice! It's an odd but beautiful language, I should put time in to learning it properly some day
 zhoubou: Yeah, same&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah TBali, so it's an extension of his childhood basically. First you bounce balls, then you write papers about bouncing balls&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: initial public offering science&#160;?
 TBali:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: eh? IOP, institute of physics
 TBali: One of the peer reviewer commented: nice, but it requires only high scool physics
 AntiSquid: ya i can't read properly anymore
 TBali: Well he is high school. But actualy there was more than high school maths in it
 AntiSquid: i actually thought i see IPO
 Astrobytes: Screen break for squid
 MSmits: TBali if they say "it only requires high school physics" then thats poor criticism. If you can solve a problem noone else has, with simpler tools, so much the better
 Astrobytes: Agreed. It's not exactly a trivial problem.
 TBali: he studies in a spec math class , best in country so could use some analysis
 MSmits: I used high school physics to prove there's a black hole in the center of our galaxy, with my students
 Astrobytes: "chaoticity" though - that a real word?
 TBali: now it is accepted, after some changes needed to submitted
 MSmits: i mean it wasnt original but we used the original data
 Astrobytes: Nicely done MSmits!
 zhoubou: That's cool
 MSmits: funny thing is, 1 week after they handed in the project, the scientists that used the data got the nobel prize
 MSmits: complete coincidence
 Astrobytes: Nice coincidence though eh
 TBali: Astrobytes, yes this was the same paper the simulation in Java/processing was needed
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: so... my point is, nothing wrong with high school physics&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Thought so TBali, well done to him (and you for helping him out where needed)
 Astrobytes: MSmits: it's the foundation
 MSmits: exc
 MSmits: exactly
 Astrobytes: Doing biology, chem and physics at the same time for me in highschool was confusing but rewarding when they converged at points
 MSmits: I just received an e-mail from a student just like your son TBali. He was the 11th best student in my country last year, to take the exams
 AntiSquid: is that not normal Astrobytes&#160;?
 MSmits: did similar stuff
 Astrobytes: That's awesome.
 AntiSquid: like 2 hours or so of each of those&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No I took them as main subjects
 AntiSquid: you had choice eh
 Astrobytes: Not much. Had to fight for it, because I wanted to take art and music too
 Astrobytes: Was talking about that yesterday
 MSmits: oh it's normal here, to do all those together
 AntiSquid: our entire classes we arguing with the school director about having spanish instead of french and the guy shut us down saying no ...
 AntiSquid: class *
 AntiSquid: were *
 AntiSquid: sleepy T_T
 MSmits: sometimes it's either/or with bio and phys, but many do both. Chem is mandatory for them
 Astrobytes: Yes for the first 2 years of highschool you do everything, next two you choose, then you choose again for the next two
 MSmits: here its choose after 3, so first 3 no choice
 MSmits: that is, at the highest level
 AntiSquid: smits do you have Bacalaureat like in france in your country? there's no such thing in UK afaik
 MSmits: otherwise it's after 2
 Astrobytes: Most of the time teachers advise students pretty well
 MSmits: whats bacalaureat
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at</a>
 Astrobytes: The baccalaureate is only French (or maybe Canada? And maybe another few euro countries?)
 AntiSquid: post-highschool exam
 TBali: Abitur
 TBali: in Germany
 AntiSquid: bunch of EU countries have it
 TBali: we have the same concept
 jacek: matura?
 MSmits: do you mean a full exam at the end of high school? or after?
 Astrobytes: We had (in Scotland) 6th year studies, which was like university foundation level
 Astrobytes: but that was a while ago
 TBali: Now in Hungary it also acts as the Uni entry exam for state unis
 zhoubou: jacek Same as us
 MSmits: we do have a full exam at the end AntiSquid, that encompasses about 70% of the entire curriculum. Is that what you mean?
 MSmits: not all subjects have this. Computer science doesnt
 MSmits: physics does
 AntiSquid: "now" TBali&#160;? wasn't it always like that&#160;?
 MSmits: physics exam takes 3 hours
 MSmits: it's pretty nerve wracking for some students
 TBali: there is even an international version <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate</a>
 MSmits: the grade is 50% of the total grade on your diploma
 MSmits: the other 50% is all the stuff you did before the exam
 TBali: AnitSquid - no, in my time I had separate Baccalaurate exam, and Uni entry exam 3 weeks later
 MSmits: it's important to have such a national exam, to prevent schools from messing with the bar students have to pass. they can make it too easy otherwise
 AntiSquid: cool, maybe i can go to Uni and do gender studies now TBali
 TBali: My son did the USA Sat Physics Subject test just to see how it goes, but in the end he did not apply for USA univ
 TBali: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat-subject-tests/subjects/science/physics">https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat-subject-tests/subjects/science/physics</a>
 MSmits: i dont understand why gender studies is a thing. What do you learn there?
 MSmits: dont know if they have that here
 AntiSquid: clearly you're intolerant?
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: please  enlighten me&#160;:)
 TBali: I think it is overblown by politics, both sides
 MSmits: i dont even know what it teaches
 Astrobytes: As usual, real issues become polarising and divisive because of hype.
 MSmits: hm ok, but what is the actual issue?
 AntiSquid: gender studies battle inequality&#160;! 
 MSmits:&#160;!=   ?
 AntiSquid: generate new genders, release genders on the gender stock market and pump up their values
 MSmits: mmh i doubt thats what i tis
 MSmits: that sounds more like genetic experimentation
 MSmits: so is this part of a politics curriculum then?
 AntiSquid: geez there are scholarly articles now trying to promote it lolsorry my sarcasm can't beat that
 MSmits: i gave up and googled it
 Astrobytes: There is real inequality, real hatred, real issues
 AntiSquid: you probably learn how to be a smooth political talker with that degree, it develops proper bullshiting skills
 Astrobytes: Squid subscribes to the media-led description of it
 MSmits: there always is
 MSmits: AntiSquid that's a common critisicm of social sciences in general. I don't think it should be limited to gender studies.. speaking as someone who just read about it on wiki for the first time
 MSmits: dont have a very high opinion of social sciences myself, as a physicist
 MSmits: sure it has value, but it also seems to be messy and often wrong
 AntiSquid: social sciences is a great ideal
 AntiSquid: but that's not what they're pushing
 Astrobytes: Nor I as a biologist, but they exist and they exist to question
 MSmits: who is they
 AntiSquid: the ones teaching the curriculum for the gender studies degree i mean
 Astrobytes: What about the gender studies degree do you disagree with?
 MSmits: from what i read on the wiki, which again, is all i know about gender studies atm, it seems to use a lot of vaguely defined words
 MSmits: that alone is problematic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't get an additional degree because i initially took physics w/ calculus and the new degree requires physics for engineers ... wtf is the difference?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: but physics is a large field
 Astrobytes: Society in general is problematic, why wouldn't studying it be problematic?
 MSmits: for example, when people talk about "feminism" they have wildly different ideas about what it even means
 AntiSquid: there being 50 genders or more part and many other mostly theatrical studies about social aspects of our world Astrobytes, that's what i disagree with
 Astrobytes: Antisquid: that's not gender studies
 MSmits: AntiSquid gender is a word that has apparently evolved to have a different meaning to some people.  Noone would deny humans have 2 genders biologically
 MSmits: the problem is that the definitions seem unregulated. That's probably what you have a problem with also
 Astrobytes: It's more about the relation of genders to each other and the reasons for inequality: very broad subject. Same as studying race relations
 MSmits: inequality of opportunity or inequality of outcome&#160;?
 MSmits: it's a hugely different issue
 MSmits: people just call it inequality, but thats bad
 Scarfield: FemstroBytes
 Astrobytes: The 50 gender thing: yes there are a lot of (imo) total idiots around touting ridiculous stuff but that's the only part picked up by the media.
 AntiSquid: i made a joke about the woke aspect of it, which is very real, didn't meant to go with chat completely offtopic to discuss it
 Astrobytes: Both MSmits. It's a subject worthy of study is all I'm saying.
 MSmits: woke is another term that is too vaguely defined and is mostly used to trigger/shame/punish/encourage people without being too specific about what you're saying
 AntiSquid: even if you take just the male vs female part of gender studies you'll see it's partly pure rubbish
 AntiSquid: or maybe mostly
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid you read way too much alt media :D
 MSmits: Astrobytes i agree it is
 AntiSquid: that's an assumption
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: LOL where have you been
 MSmits: words matter though, they leak into society and take on a life of their own, that's the problem
 MSmits: like the gender thing
 AntiSquid: judgement is based on what i heard directly from the horses mouth
 Astrobytes: The whole identify as a stonekin, 350 gender thing is just a meme
 Astrobytes: now
 Scarfield: just didnt feel like coding lately, but not the first break i have had&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: That doesn't mean there aren't people out there pushing that though
 MSmits: AntiSquid you do have to be careful about rightwing media. They sometimes have a point, but more often than not they will make false connections
 Astrobytes: But it's not in mainstream gender studies that is for sure.
 AntiSquid: the memes are there to point out the flaws, but discussing toilet signs is part of gender studies
 MSmits: like when it's about gay rights, they start comparing to bestiality or pedophilia and such
 AntiSquid: for example
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: all good man, I know how it goes
 Astrobytes: And: BREAKFIELD
 TBali: Astrobytes, yo you are a biologist?
 Scarfield: I honestly dont understand why its even being argued to be "genders"
 Astrobytes: Yes TBali, well, by qualification at least.
 Scarfield: yay, pun name, i have missed that xD
 AntiSquid: MSmits you're also making assumptions
 TBali: What area are you working in?
 MSmits: rightwing media is obsessed with who should go to which toilet :P
 Astrobytes: Pharma regulatory TBali
 MSmits: arent we all AntiSquid
 struct: Current media is trash
 Astrobytes: MSmits: that's a real issue, for all parties concerned
 struct: I cant even watch the news on tv anymore
 TBali: Coding for work, or just for fun?
 struct: its unbereable
 Scarfield: i will make up a new gender, that by definition can only belong to one person, so private toilet
 MSmits: it's an issue because rightwingers make it one is what i meant
 MSmits: it shouldnt be
 MSmits: who cares about that, just let people go where they want
 MSmits: nothing ever happens
 Astrobytes: TBali: I do a little for work (scripts to help me out etc) but the rest for fun yes. I did have 1 dev job back in 2000-2002;
 AntiSquid: no MSmits, was specifically talking about shit you hear from gender studies crowd directly
 MSmits: ah ok, i dont listen to the gender studies crowd, so i dunno. Maybe i twould be interesting
 TBali: I am wondering, how much&#160;% of  CG community is pr developer?
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Sure, I mean that in some places people get a bit off with the wrong genders being in their toilets - potential for abuse.
 MSmits: yes, they seem to think there is so much potential, yet you almost never hear about someone who pretended to be a different gender to spy on the toilets... that just doenst happen
 Astrobytes: In Sweden, the toilets are mixed.
 MSmits: its a right win fantasy
 MSmits: +g
 AntiSquid: you might have seen it in your work place but didn't pay attention to it or didn't realize the flaws
 Scarfield: but sweden also doesnt use words for him/her anymore
 Astrobytes: No, there are cases of abuse. But they are a lot rarer than those news outlets would have you believe.
 MSmits: and those rare cases. Do you think  a law would have stopped them
 Astrobytes: Sweden's been cool about the gender thing for ... as long as I've ever visited there at least :D
 TBali: him/her word  I don't even know how am I suppose to use it 'properly' in English. 'They'. and then isse the verb in singular 3rd?
 Astrobytes: Hell no MSmits. But it's about the illusion of safety.
 AntiSquid: there's a push of 50% stats instead of skill for example
 AntiSquid: that's not wrong?
 Scarfield: they have gone a bot overboard imo, there is a difference between the genders. Trying to push that there isnt as some politically correct agenda just seems weird. But they arent hurting anyone, but us danes can joke about these weird swedes :p
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: perhaps officially? But they most certainly do personally!
 AntiSquid: also all the BAME politics is also part of it
 AntiSquid: you heard about BAME in your work place right&#160;?
 TBali: Scarfield, you weork at Evil Corp, so that does not count&#160;:-)
 TBali: Mr. Robot - what a great show, really liked it
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but the fact it's official Scarfield, it makes a lot of people feel really comfortable. In everyday life/speech they use whatever but they are respectful
 Scarfield: wait, they only added a gender less word.. lol i thought they "banned" the gendered words xD
 MSmits: I dislike policing speech
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: They also hide from their neighbours if they are about to both leave their apartments at the same time :D
 zhoubou: Hmm I might like this Sweden :thinking:
 Astrobytes: MSmits: they don't police the speech
 MSmits: then it's fine
 MSmits: there was a big problem in canada when they policed speech about gender
 AntiSquid: who doesn't police speech?
 Astrobytes: Sweden is geek heaven btw
 Scarfield: yea, i actually thought that was what they did, at least i looked it up
 AntiSquid: you have to be very careful what you say these days&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Context squid, context. I was referring to the Swedish.
 MSmits: AntiSquid depends on what you do mostly
 MSmits: if you could get fired for what you say
 Scarfield: also i think i saw some statistic that the swedish had the highest percentage of beautiful people to population
 MSmits: sometimes it's good to punish people for what they say though... it depends. Cancel culture is real though

 Astrobytes: What about the vocabulary?
 Scarfield: and doesnt teach MCTS,, pff
 Astrobytes: *SWEMCTS
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Ah welcome back EcksDeeField
 Scarfield: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: What's your next multi then Scarfield-a-tron
 TBali: Hmm, I see TryAngle Catch is accepted
 Astrobytes: Yes it certainly is.
 TBali: could have been a great community contest 
 Scarfield: hmm not sure, failed hard at the last contest. Maybe ill finish that, but will probably look at something else first
 AntiSquid: listed 2 words frequently used in their papers / studies / showcases you say i took it from right wing media ... Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: You may now practice AI, Disappointment and 5% TBali!
 TBali: might need to try this. But I have 24 untouched community multis on todo list 
 TBali: It is hard to motivate for community multis - only the best are there, so leaderboard is filled with good bots only
 Anonymous12321: im need help
 Anonymous12321: how find prime
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: didn't say right wing
 Anonymous12321: oof
 struct: :tada:
 struct: one person completed potw
 Astrobytes: Oh nice
 AntiSquid: do i need to quote chat history now&#160;:/
 TBali: what is potw
 struct: puzzle of the week: othello
 TBali: I mean which is it now
 Scarfield: prisoner of the wild
 TBali: I still have my golfed submission there&#160;:-)
 TBali: 86/156
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: you know what i am referring to and i am sure you are capable to see the issues yourself, but like to either play devils advocate or w/e
 TBali: not bad from 126 bytes
 Scarfield: "leaderboard would be modified to TrueSkill point PER source code chars."
 Scarfield: sad that this hasnt been changed yet :p
 TBali: C++ bots would fail miserably
 TBali: Ruby would rule the world
 Scarfield: hmm Pengwins or pokerchip race will probably be my next multi btw furryBytes
 TBali: actually I am planning to try out MCTS is a fast language.(I coded mcts only once, for uttt and in php).Shall I try C++ or Rust? which might pose less difficulties for a beginner?
 duckymirror: I didn't manage to get a Rust version working without unsafe code...
 TBali: I struggled with Rust vene for short solo puzzles
 duckymirror: Or rather, without unsafe code and little overhead
 struct: Might be easier to find stuff on c++ than on rust, but dont quote me on that
 TBali: I am a bit afraid of C++ memory management
 AntiSquid: in what sense
 struct: on cg just allocate and dont touch it
 TBali: Making coder mistake, hard to debug?
 TBali: Being inexpereinced with pointers
 Scarfield: pre allocate a nodepool, assign nodes as the algo goes on
 AntiSquid: pointer headaches are fun once you get used to it 
 TBali: Okay, but if my code is too fast than I get out of memory
 TBali: so need to reuse
 AntiSquid: then ascend to pointers referencing pointers of pointers for more fun
 duckymirror: My Rust MCTS doesn't run out of memory
 struct: You either have a bug or dont use all the memory
 Scarfield: you dont have to use pointers, have an int index for the firstChildNode and an int for the number of children for example
 TBali: And you keep all created nodes intact?
 struct: yes
 AntiSquid: i love pointers, i am holding onto them ... i let go of recursion, that's already a big emotional loss 
 TBali: In php I usually turn off garbage collector. When I run 2048 and Samegame offline (for more time) I had out of memory...
 AntiSquid: besides a friend of mine with 20+ years of C++ experience convinced me to use pointers 
 THEASIAN: hello
 Scarfield: ooh, forgot about the 2048 multi.. i should make my own to do list
 TBali: optim it is
 Scarfield: yea
 TBali: but offline result is so long that cannot fit in the source 100k hardcoded  :-)
 TBali: But with some encoding it still boosted my points
 TBali: 2 bits per move, than base64
 Scarfield: that is still something i havent touched yet, local search -&gt; encoding, could be fun to do 
 TBali: (zlib is left out from CG's php...)
 TBali: I played it jhust when php v8 with the new JIT apeeared  - used for some benchmarking
 TBali: And actually JIT makes a difference for CG-like workloads (not for web apps) 
 TBali: 2-3x speedup
 TBali: but still slow 
 TBali: too bad CG is using 2 major release older version...
 struct: how much code would break if they updated version?
 TBali: not much imho
 TBali: unless you use really not according to best practice
 TBali: the type system became stronger but it is fully opt-on
 TBali: opt-in
 Scarfield: optim, heh heh ugh
 TBali: not sure about C++  It is much better  established, yet Rust seems shiny with the promise of memory safety
 TBali: If I learn how not to fight borrow checker
 JBM: high-level C++ is memory-safe enough
 duckymirror: You get used to the borrow checker.
 TBali: Funny thing . just made a C++ skill assessment on Pluralsight - it is completely flawed. It says "Expert".   Flattering but far from truth
 TBali: "Great start! You did better than 87% of your peers."Maybe lot of people do this as beginner. But that does not make me an expert
 struct: expert = ready for easy puzzles on cg
 TBali: Yeah I am for that. I know for, if, ...:-)
 AntiSquid: are there other online assessments like that?
 TBali: don't know. Pluralsight is subscription based
 TBali: It was 20-30 quiz questions
 TBali: Maybe I was lucky, with some educated guesses
 TBali: lots of lambdas, objects, pointers
 AntiSquid: does the assessment help&#160;? 
 Scarfield: Which is the correct term:1. If loop2. For loop
 TBali: But did it immediately after watching 5h of C++ tutorial
 TBali: that helped
 JBM: Scarfield: yes
 Scarfield: xD
 TBali: loophole
 selmaDa: :neutral_face: how?
 Astrobytes: gn all!
 AntiSquid: bye bye
 Scarfield: :wave"
 Scarfield: lol
 JBM: gn8
 struct: gn
 Scarfield: gn
 TBali: :wave:
 AntiSquid: is there a quick contribution tutorial for lazy folks btw?
 JBM: sure
 JBM: "don't"
 JBM: contributions aren't for the lazy
 selmaDa: :joy: 
 TBali: or the faint hearted
 TBali:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i will keep it under WIP lol 
 struct: just the sdk tech io thing I guess
 JBM: yeah WIP scrubs it all
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/408/tech-io-documentation/create-a-playground">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/408/tech-io-documentation/create-a-playground</a>
 AntiSquid: promise it will be less sloppy than your TVC
 selmaDa: can i ask you guys?
 JBM: like my tvc is sloppy
 JBM: it's got regression tests
 Scarfield: less sloppy..? how could it be anything but less sloppy, TcV is perfection
 JBM: a proper MVC separation of concerns
 TBali: is it approved now?
 JBM: not yet
 selmaDa: tcv better
 Scarfield: god i cant type today
 AntiSquid: i can throw something like that together, but no worries, want to do somewhat decent animations, got some funny idea
 TBali: I cannot solve it. I am rooting for the troll. My soulmate. Cannot think of beating him
 JBM: in-jokes and easter eggs
 selmaDa: ok :slight_smile:
 JBM: a proper learning curve
 JBM: per-league upgrades and oodies
 JBM: *goodies
 AntiSquid: learning curve? let me check me rank there again
 JBM: debug mode
 JBM: &lt;blink&gt;
 AntiSquid: is it down&#160;?
 selmaDa: can i ask for something&#160;?
 JBM: i re-submitted it a few days ago
 JBM: it's up all right
 struct: ask selmaDa
 JBM: or ask us
 selmaDa: can we make money from codinGame?
 JBM: but don't ask to ask
 AntiSquid: oh i dropped a bit
 JBM: sure
 selmaDa: how?
 AntiSquid: maybe the the learning curve theory is real for tvc
 JBM: what's your ranking AntiSquid?
 JBM: selmaDa: you tell us
 selmaDa: 3:joy:
 AntiSquid: 43, was 11 without trying hard
 selmaDa: my level 3
 struct: Go back to 2016 win the accountant contest
 struct: profit
 selmaDa: 2016!
 TBali: solved on D... lol
 JBM: :you_rock:
 selmaDa: me&#160;? :upside_down:
 JBM: no, not yet for you
 selmaDa: ok :joy:
 Scarfield: :you_paper:
 struct: Only way to make money here is to win a contest I guess
 struct: and even then the prizes might not be money
 JBM: i've seen people ready ot pay forsolutions in a specific language here already
 JBM: wouldn't match my rate, though
 TBali: really? omg
 AntiSquid: D next contest, no matter what, call me out if i dodge again, was lazy last time worried i need to google too much
 TBali: And how you rate D?
 TBali: 1 to 10?
 selmaDa: if is not money&#160;? what's the prizes
 JBM: depends on the language
 AntiSquid: idk, didn't try using pointers yet TBali
 AntiSquid: it's alright i don't see why people hate it
 AntiSquid: better than java for sure
 selmaDa: @JBM 
 Scarfield: Hoodies, posters, gift cards and such is what i remember
 TBali: on a very novice level D is just C, no?
 JBM: i'm lost wrt D
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 struct: selmaDa check there
 JBM: it used to be my "better C++" hope
 JBM: but apparently now it's GC and all the shit
 struct: Unleash the geek had 3k amazon gift card as first prize
 JBM: a good thing for me rust came up
 TBali: converted 30 puzzles, but did not hve too much impact on my
 selmaDa: yes perfect 
 struct: But that was a sponsored contest
 struct: Nowadays im not sure what the prizes are
 AntiSquid: because it's not outlandish syntax-wise
 struct: beside a tshirt for top 20
 JBM: more like top3
 AntiSquid: canvas to 3&#160;?
 Scarfield: you could sell the tshirt for profit
 AntiSquid: and shirts top 20 
 selmaDa: does there are more in 2021?
 TBali: everlasting glory for top10 
 Scarfield: when it eventually arrives
 struct: "May 6" selmaDa
 struct: But it may change
 AntiSquid: ML contests give good prizes and some of them don't have strong competition
 selmaDa: why&#160;?
 struct: I dont know
 struct: Sometimes it gets delayed
 selmaDa: ok
 selmaDa: What did you gain from your presence here?
 struct: knowledge
 Scarfield: enemies and bald spots
 selmaDa: :thumbsup_tone2::joy:
 TBali: fun, trolls
 TBali: castels
 selmaDa: me nothing
 AntiSquid: that's a controversial topic selmaDa
 selmaDa: i khnow
 TBali: gender studies&#160;:-)
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: i have a certificate for it
 TBali: That's a strange book: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://leanpub.com/thinking-functionally-in-php">http://leanpub.com/thinking-functionally-in-php</a>
 Scarfield: but seriously learned a lot, and had fun doing so
 selmaDa: heyy!
 TBali: Not in the spirit of "right tool for the rtight job", but still interesting
 JBM: dat book titel
 TBali: I bought it
 AntiSquid: selmaDa what matters is what you want to gain, focus on that
 JBM: so how's your train of thought now
 TBali: read it 70% already
 JBM: if you could think functionally in php, you wouldn't code in php to begin with
 JBM: change my mind
 TBali: Well, it was interesting 
 JBM: yeah
 TBali: My mindset is not functional.
 selmaDa: i want to learn programming and earn money&#160;!
 JBM: it's made you like FP
 JBM: and want to stop PHP
 JBM: goals achieved
 AntiSquid: he could have read a book about stock exchange in that time and now be coding a bot for trading, right JBM&#160;?
 JBM: could've
 TBali: I solved a few puzzles in Haskell, it was really nice
 TBali: found quite hard to change mindset
 TBali: and my codes are most likely ugly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: besides the speed, what is wrong with php?
 AntiSquid: $$$$
 JBM: i don't have all night
 TBali: Read part if this, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out">http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out</a>
 AntiSquid: we want bitcoin symbol
 selmaDa: :person_frowning_tone2:
 TBali: Even saw 4h of haskell tutorial on Pluralsight
 TBali: But still hard to think of a problem in FP way
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i make $ with php
 selmaDa: @JBM are you freelancer
 TBali: Okay, than I a worse - I do php as hobby... 
 AntiSquid: not sure anymore i finished the book learnyouahaskell, probably skimmed through last few chapters
 JBM: selmaDa: what's your budget?
 TBali: I did not finish
 TBali: just the basic chapters
 selmaDa: 0$:slight_smile:
 TBali: what is that in €?
 AntiSquid: hired, what are your skills selmaDa&#160;? 
 selmaDa: programming and desing 
 JBM: who doesn't like to dese in the weekends
 AntiSquid: dresing&#160;?
 selmaDa: yes
 TBali: dressing? what skill is that?
 selmaDa: desing
 JBM: something inaccessible to us programmers
 selmaDa: not dresing
 AntiSquid: he's probably playing visual novels where he has to dress up the grill
 AntiSquid: or she&#160;?
 TBali: they
 TBali:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ow
 JBM: pump us the jam; dress up the grill
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i use php to easily make custom PDFs on the fly from session &amp; cookie data and email it.  What would it take for me to do that easily in another lang?
 <b>**AntiSquid takes cover</b></p><p><img src="/a/12323424608735" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: sql as well
 TBali: Sure, I do like PHP, while seeing its shortcomings
 JBM: “easily”
 JBM: “on the fly”
 selmaDa: :repeat_one: can we build app for free
 AntiSquid: really depends what you're used to imo PatrickMcGinnisII
 selmaDa: but online for lasy :joy:
 JBM: oh, and “custom”
 AntiSquid: you can do that in python @_@
 TBali: Well it was not planned properly, but  eveolved naturally..
 TBali: But at least moving in the right direction in past 5 releases
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well i don't use .asp ... i kinda hate .asp - everything i made with it ran slow too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the php is easier
 selmaDa: good night :wave_tone1:
 AntiSquid: tell us your gender first
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess i should be an azure addict now?
 selmaDa: girl
 TBali: In CG, there is no real difference to more "modern" langauges, except speed
 AntiSquid: ok good night
 TBali: all constructs there, almost
 selmaDa: you too
 selmaDa: see you tomorow
 TBali: bye selmaDa
 AntiSquid: get and avatar btw, don't be like that high level lurker 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl, a girl shows up and yall lose your ... nevermind
 therealbeef: allegedly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just wrote 100 lines for euler's TAC game and it still won't do anything real
 TBali: C++ seems to have more "quirks" now, than php
 TBali: was it 100 loc docblock?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well, i have class now. :P
 TBali: good start&#160;:-)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tbali , you try chess with php?  i can't get a minimax to run past depth 2
 TBali: In all the multis, I make nice classes, etc. Very readable. Than I realize the sim speed will suck
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dunno if using alpha beta is even worth it
 AntiSquid: feel free to identify as a girl to fill up the void or if you think it gets you more attention lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there r some real cool women on here, they just don't show up much
 TBali: did not try chess yet
 AntiSquid: doubt CG has "girl" roleplayers, there are no ingame items to trade
 TBali: and after I realize speed sucks, I go for heuristics -
 TBali: Don't know female&#160;% of CG community. my prejudice is it is fairly low
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think turning off the gc asnd even error reporting help alot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i started dropping data into static classes and it does run a little faster, dunno why
 TBali: gc - I do that.Error_reporting? Ebven if there are no errors? 
 TBali: some checking gets turned off by that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think there is some try {} catch that gets bypassed
 TBali: I like to use type hinting - even if it actually slows down beacuse of extra runtime checks
 TBali: OK, I will try out that one next time. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i use it for validating code... but turn off for submit
 TBali: I also usually use declare(strict_types=1); which might have perf penalty
 TBali: how can you turn of type hinting&#160;?
 TBali: you either declare it or not, no?
 TBali: (I mean function arguments, return types)
 TBali: from 7.4 class methods could have been also type hinted
 TBali: I mean properties
 PatrickMcGinnisII: chess can be done without classes, but i did it with classes
 TBali: I muss struct
 TBali: miss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the board can be modified with a history stack, which i do...but the tree is too big at depth 3
 TBali: classes help so much to organize code, &amp; data. But really slows down things
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct, lol still used in C
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well using intval() versus using (int) , i dunno if there is a speed thing to it
 TBali: do you use bitboards for chess?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no i didn't, just a linear array of 64 values
 TBali: I found replacing bitwise operators with arithmetihic usually helped
 TBali: In UTTT
 TBali: I mean vice versa
 TBali: it is too late...
 TBali: actually a simple vector type would help for php speed. Array is jjust too verstaile
 PatrickMcGinnisII: thing is with these games you have 3 states for each square or cell...enemy piece, no piece or your piece ... So there's so many compares (ifs) that anything in a loop gets slowed way down
 TBali: using sinternally a sorted hashmap with zvals as keys and as values is just so overkill if I need just a fixed list of int
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I try to use bitboards with xor operations, but its like re-inventing the wheel
 TBali: Might be, chess is complex.
 TBali: For Tic Tac Toe, I found good bitboard ideas on the net
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I want to use splfixedarrays, but the functions are limited
 TBali: implemented it
 TBali: And I read that splfixedarray is actually not that great in speed
 TBali: (too old)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: priority queues are impossible speedwise on CG
 TBali: I used for some puzzles.
 TBali: A* requires it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well u figure out any more speed stuff, plz let me know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gonna go eat some buffalo wing cauliflower
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 TBali:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: that's a new one to me ... next up pork wing cauliflower

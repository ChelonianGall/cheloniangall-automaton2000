 Astrobytes: It's just a database...
 cegprakash: but how is it fast
 cegprakash: postgres is not good for text search

 BlaiseEbuth: What's so fun
 Astrobytes: Carrefour Clashes
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Also Amadeus and Facebook now
 Astrobytes: I just find the concept amusing
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't get the fun in this. But OK ^^'
 Astrobytes: I have a peculiar sense of humour. Almost as bad as TBali
 BlaiseEbuth: Wow&#160;! Aneo puzzle gonna be removed.
 BlaiseEbuth: Time to copy the statement and the tests to publish it back.
 Astrobytes: No great loss there but sucks they won't even reply to CG
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, they have removed better ones
 Astrobytes: I never even got a chance to try the great dispatch

 UnnamedCodinGamer: It was great
 MadKnight: a great dispatch
 UnnamedCodinGamer: sadly no one did a similar community contribution
 BlaiseEbuth: I (and others) thought about, but the time is a problem...
 Astrobytes: what was the limit?
 MadKnight: i can code it for u guys
 MadKnight: just tell me what to do

 BlaiseEbuth: *Please
 Astrobytes: hah
 BlaiseEbuth: *a
 Astrobytes: No, it was a hah
 BlaiseEbuth: Ha...
 Astrobytes: Do I really have to explain the subtle differences between my haha, ha and hah?
 Astrobytes: :P
 SotaUN: Hey!
 BlaiseEbuth: I get the ha and the haha. But the hah is over my comprehension
 derjack: huh?
 Astrobytes: The hah has a little breath at the end, like the end of a laugh or small cough
 struct: ha
 BlaiseEbuth: So what difference with haha&#160;?
 Astrobytes: haha is laughing
 derjack: heh
 Astrobytes: hah is a little more contemptuous
 UnnamedCodinGamer: well said
 BlaiseEbuth: You despise me?&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: haha no
 Astrobytes: Contemptuous in tone
 Astrobytes: Sneering perhaps
 BlaiseEbuth: You know that I have to google translate one words in each of your sentences...
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway. Gonna establish newspeak for interjections...

 BlaiseEbuth: Paid?
 Astrobytes: newspeak for interjections :o
 BlaiseEbuth: To avoid interpretation problems

 BlaiseEbuth: You should, you not gonna submit your bot during the contest anyway Struct.
 struct: Well I did said top 100 or delete
 struct: This increases my chances
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: derjack: that and shut up wesley 
 BlaiseEbuth: Enough of volunteering for me.
 Astrobytes: Paid positions only for you from now on eh
 struct: What if this the contest I would be able to get a tshirt
 struct: Its a hard call
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm already the chat saucier for free...
 Astrobytes: "chat saucier" :D
 BlaiseEbuth: :salt:
 struct: Do you know if there will me any more prizes?
 Astrobytes: What, like Most Glorious Tester gets a Chocolate Medal or something? :P
 struct: no I mean from the contest
 struct: Testers cant win prizes
 struct: Current prizes are tshirt for top 20
 struct: and canvas for top 3
 RoboStac: I think testers have been given tshirts in the past
 struct: Anyways what am I thinking, is not like I can fight for the prizes :p
 Astrobytes: Ah, no unless it's sponsored I don't think they do 'prizes' as such  any more
 Astrobytes: And yeah, I think robo is right. Ping Thibaud a message to confirm I guess

 Astrobytes: haha
 BlaiseEbuth: So. Slap me with your large pop culture.
 Astrobytes: lol, you do cheer me up on boring days Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: :flushed:
 BlaiseEbuth: "holy subtle facial expressions Batman" I'm still interested by the explanation.
 Astrobytes: holy &lt;appropriate expression&gt; Batman was a catchphrase of his sidekick, Robin
 Astrobytes: And has formed the basis of many a joke since.
 BlaiseEbuth: How am I supposed to know that? Remember english is not my native language. :expressionless:
 Astrobytes: I thought that since superhero movies are so terrible that somehow you were involved in them
 Astrobytes: Only some nefarious hellbeast would continue to inflict these things upon humanity
 AgentM12: Is this chat codingame or is it linked to a discord channel? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: It's codingame XMPP. Discord is separate.

 UnnamedCodinGamer: or find a bug for instance while loop not breaking
 AgentM12: How do I start a private clash it doesn't show my friend?

 JordyH: My code clashes won't start anymore. I don't get into the IDE. Am I the only one having those problems?

 Astrobytes: Well, this was not the most exciting chat history to read after a small break.
 derjack: eeyup
 Tibu_9405: hi
 Panagis: can i create multiple files? 
 therealbeef: you can, but need some tooling
 Astrobytes: Sure. But you need to combine them into one for CG submits
 Astrobytes: hey therealbeef
 therealbeef: hi
 Smelty: ....scammers have been getting smarter
 Smelty: one just tried to blackmail me
 struct: its a common tactic
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: hmm..what if i create a scambait account
 Astrobytes: scammers on where?
 Smelty: email
 Smelty: o . o
 Smelty: also, have clashes been fixed
 Astrobytes: Just bin those dodgy emails.Yeah I think so. Might need to clear your cache
 Smelty: ah okay
 Smelty: hi
 Mr.Pepper: o/
 ShannonNorris97: When your approach of picking a random valid move worked better than your minimax solution on checkers... something not quite right there :joy:
 jacek: checkers eh
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah, thought I'd give a smaller bot game a go today
 jacek: simple material eval should get you to top50
 Astrobytes: And welcome to CG board game addiction :smiling_imp:
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah I'll have made a mistake somewhere, just gotta find it. Probably when I was trying to establish the multiple jumps in one turn fiasco
 ShannonNorris97: My scoring system is also incredibly basic at the moment so I need to find what works
 jacek: yhm
 wsb1994: this is p fun lol
 wsb1994: where was this when I was studying for FAANG lmao
 jacek: FAANG?
 struct: facebook apple amazon netflix google
 struct: jacek what are you working on atm?
 jacek: last thing i submited was checkers
 jacek: trying to improve search tree
 struct: How long ago was that?
 jacek: Today at 21:08
 jacek: why you ask
 struct: just wondering
 jacek: oO
 ShannonNorris97: Do you guys have any recommendations for getting better at the bot programming games? Just generally? If I wanted to get really good at them, is there anything you'd recommend spending time to learn? At the moment I'm taking a bit of a scattershot approach
 jacek: firstly get your minimax fixed
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah, for sure. That algorithm seems super common for these games, so I'm wanting to get a better understanding of it for definite
 struct: Implement it on a simple game
 struct: tic tac toe is perfect for it
 ShannonNorris97: Ah nice I'll do that, I did tic tac toe to learn it, but I think I followed a tutorial, so I'll try to do it by myself this time
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and honestly, once you have it down switch to the negamax variant - it's cleaner and easier to work with.
 Astrobytes: (re the minimax algo)
 Astrobytes: alpha beta pruning too btw.
 ShannonNorris97: Oh wow I never thought about it having different variants. Makes sense as to how people manage to climb the leaderboards on minimax games now, rather than all staying the same
 Astrobytes: alpha beta pruning too btw - BEFORE switching to negamax
 Astrobytes: Get it down
 ShannonNorris97: Ah sweet, thanks so much for your help guys. I'm gonna learn those&#160;:)
 kresteodymium: hello
 jacek: ohai
 Astrobytes: ShannonNorris97: If you need some questions answering you can ask here, we all learn things from this chat when it's serious&#160;;)
 ShannonNorris97: Thanks Astrobytes, I'll definitely do that&#160;:)
 struct: I probably have some code for ttt
 struct: lost somewhere in my folders
 Astrobytes: For minimax and alphabeta pruning there are a bunch of good videos on youtube, and some nice realtime visualisation tools on the web too. I always recommend working through a small basic game tree by hand though (paper/whiteboard)
 jacek: paper eh
 struct: I have one file with minimax + mcts
 struct: not sure if it works
 Astrobytes: soccer eh jacek

 Astrobytes: (watch the video, you'll get my comment)
 jacek: :scream:
 kresteodymium: hello
 struct: You can even watch it muted and you wil still understand minimax
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Ow Now, Ai Luhhhve his eccent
 Astrobytes: He does some good vids, gotta say

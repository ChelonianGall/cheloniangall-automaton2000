 TechnoBot: Excuse me
 TechnoBot: Who wants to 1v1 me
 howdoyoulive: will, first for all, the if-else order is important
 howdoyoulive:  if you having one if condition is angle&lt;90, and one else if condition is angle&lt;75, since the angle&lt;90 is met, the angle&lt;75 will be ignore
 OnTheBrink: Just played "The Bridge".  describing it to my gf worked best by comparing it to the squid game glass bridge.  thought that was funny.
 The_chosen_coder: Hello
 humanbeethoven: how is everyone doing
 humanbeethoven: bs]
 TechnoBot: hi
 TechnoBot: @humanbeethoven
 TechnoBot: we are doing fine&#160;;)
 TechnoBot: *wink*
 TechnoBot: /me
 TechnoBot: Squid game is EZ
 AlanSpacer: Kill everyone before you play a single game
 AlanSpacer: insta squid game win
 TechnoBot: lol
 TechnoBot: i play minecraft, squid game is easy
 TechnoBot: i just kill everyone
 TechnoBot: in the games
 TechnoBot: like pushing someone into the void in glass bridge
 TechnoBot: void()
 TechnoBot: lol
 TechnoBot: ez wins
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: TechnoBot why don't you talk about code or something else?
 AlanSpacer: prosecute the man for having interests
 Uljahn: for having interests other than coding :smirk:
 Thorcode: Uljahn I will beat you in clash first&#160;:)
 Uljahn: ok
 Thorcode: again?
 LordGrim972: Hello
 Thorcode: hi
 TechnoBot: brgb
 TechnoBot: brb
 AndrewJP: be red green blue
 Thorcode: code it not easy to do&#160;:)
 Thorcode: is
 Thorcode: how can I get the nothing output?
 Thorcode: input
 Thorcode: the input is nothing so how can I use if?
 jzen: What puzzle is it?
 Thorcode: a test
 Thorcode: like the temperature
 Thorcode: I can't solve it when the input is nothing
 Thorcode: so how can I get nothing input
 jzen: Well, in Temperatures you first get the number of inputs, so you can check if that is 0
 Thorcode: I know that
 Thorcode: but when the input is nothing like "" how can I handle it
 Uljahn: temperatures = input()if not temperatures: print('nothing')
 Thorcode: oh thanks
 Thorcode: what is EOF error?
 Uljahn: alternative way could beif temperatures == "": but it's not pythonic
 KalamariKing: EOF is end of file, meaning a string or parenthesis or something is not closed
 KalamariKing: Thorcode
 pihack: HEY WHAT LANGUAGE IS BETTER FOR BIGIN?
 Debelyoud: python I think
 Thorcode: have a certifications in Codingame is not easy&#160;:(
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/evaluate/?id=4715438f0a443831c6649083421961f2bee9958">https://www.codingame.com/evaluate/?id=4715438f0a443831c6649083421961f2bee9958</a>
 Thorcode: pass this test is not easy&#160;:)
 Thorcode: my skill suck&#160;:(
 jzen: You'll get there eventually
 Thorcode: my score suck
 jzen: What did you get?
 Thorcode: it is less than 1&amp;
 Thorcode: 1%
 jzen: Maybe it is the anti-cheating system
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 jzen: I believe I read something about that
 Thorcode: try that  Jzen
 jzen: So it probably checks if you switch tabs a lot and such
 jzen: Pure speculation, though
 Thorcode: oh
 jzen: Try what?
 Thorcode: the test
 jzen: I already did it
 Thorcode: what is your score?
 jzen: &gt;99%
 StyllyMyle: Finally done
 Thorcode: wow
 jzen: You can see it on my profile I believe
 pihack: what do u thing that what language is bettert&#160;? js or py 
 jzen: Either
 StyllyMyle: both are good pihack
 Thorcode: pro
 StyllyMyle: Hey how to mention people here?
 jzen: Just say their name
 StyllyMyle: jzen did you get it?
 jzen: StyllyMyle like this
 StyllyMyle: jzen: StyllyMyle like this
 jzen: You can click on a name to dm
 jzen: Yes I do
 StyllyMyle: Oh nicee
 StyllyMyle: StyllyMyle self ping!
 StyllyMyle: StyllyMyle mn
 StyllyMyle: Nop
 StyllyMyle: Anyways I finally finished with my bot to have clash of code links in discord
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/67uUqg7">https://imgur.com/a/67uUqg7</a>
 Thorcode: my first time&#160;:)
 jzen: Thorcode It seems I was mistaken
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 jzen: "You must complete this test on your own.
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: ok
 jzen: Did you pass all of the tests?
 Thorcode: not really
 Thorcode: I will try it again next month
 Thorcode:&#160;:)
 Thorcode: some of my code got error and I ignore it&#160;:)
 jzen: Yeah, that strategy sounds less than optimal
 Thorcode: IDK I'm just 13 I have a long road to move&#160;:)
 Thorcode: this site is great
 jacek:&#160;!
 Uljahn: the certification was too easy, almost like a clash
 Uljahn: "better than &gt;99% of professionals"... guess im a professional now :scream_cat:
 jzen: Professionals in what though? Maybe they had a bunch of 
 jzen: Bakers take the test or something
 jzen: :smile:
 jzen: Not to throw shade at the programming bakers of course
 Uljahn: btw there is one highly ranked chief-cooker among us :smiley:
 jzen: Who?
 Uljahn: AntiSquid
 jacek: math&#160;:( question: given car position, car angle and destination position, how do i compute the angle to destination? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/jmlsqjK.png">https://i.imgur.com/jmlsqjK.png</a>
 darkhorse64: acos (scalar product( car current direction, car desired direction))
 jacek: i have something like atan2(deltaY,deltaX) - car.angle
 darkhorse64: looks good to me 
 BizepsBaschdi: 55
 Ran_42: I think I have a bug, in the settings I have - "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false,but it still colors the pairs in my code
 KalamariKing: same thing's happening to me, could be a cg glitch
 Ran_42: ye probably it happend out of nowhere
 niluthebear: yeah same, also editor color as light theme
 niluthebear: code size problem also 
 Ran_42: ye it happend to me now too
 Ran_42: editor is white and cant change size
 KalamariKing: the editor turned white for me but that was brought back to dark mode after just toggling the dark mode switch
 TechnoBot: hi
 [CG]Thibaud: it's a bug Ran_42 , thx for bringing it up
 TechnoBot: hello
 niluthebear: :wave:
 TechnoBot: ummm
 TechnoBot: i have a question
 TechnoBot: How come there arn't any tutorials around here????
 TechnoBot: :confused:
 Schwase: what language
 Akshei: Go to Activities -&gt; Learn
 Akshei: And there are a lot of tutorials
 Schwase: ^
 Hwai: oooo
 Hwai: does it have tutorials for absolute beginners?
 KalamariKing: not really
 Uljahn: just search the web, there are plenty of free tutorials for every language
 KalamariKing: ^
 CrystalS: how do we create our own codingames for small groups?
 Uljahn: codingames?
 KalamariKing: clashes you mean&gt;?
 Uljahn: you can create a private clash or join a coding escape room as a group
 eulerscheZahl: hello
 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: that "contest" announcement is back on my front page, I already clicked the X before&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: and i dropped last-minute at codeforces :sob:
 struct:&#160;:(
 struct: which rank?
 eulerscheZahl: 17
 struct: damn
 eulerscheZahl: tablets up to #16
 eulerscheZahl: by 14 points, should have spammed more random seeds
 struct: still a good rank
 eulerscheZahl: and a fun tasks. wasn't sure if I like it at first but it got better then more I looked at it
 DomiKo: still gg euler
 derjack: oh my <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/amgqBOy_460svvp9.webm">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/amgqBOy_460svvp9.webm</a>
 struct: ban
 eulerscheZahl: my ears
 eulerscheZahl: can we actually ban derjack? because of the smurf rule, no 2 accounts per user
 struct: ban jacek instead
 miszu: lol smurf rule? Lots of people voilated that rule
 derjack: whats smurt rule
 _NikJ: Congrats on the result eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i only violated it for valid reasons. such as a chat making the whole website crash during contests
 _NikJ: Smart watch ain't that bad
 eulerscheZahl: thanks nikJ
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/coderpad-codingame-join/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/coderpad-codingame-join/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: what's codepad?
 eulerscheZahl: coderpad*
 DomiKo: I didn't know to that moment
 eulerscheZahl: i'll read the post first before drawing early conclusions
 DomiKo: "From a team of 30 to around 60 now, we’re all very excited by this change."
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the team size increasing in the "about us" section
 [CG]Thibaud: the about us section doesn't include the CoderPad members yet
 eulerscheZahl: i mean that i've seen CG itself grow over the years
 gavi: hello. about multithreading, it seems that CG does not provide multiple threads because I never see solutions taking advantage of them.Or is it something planned for CG?
 eulerscheZahl: you can use multithreading. but your code will always run on a single core
 gavi: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: i can't tell about future plans
 eulerscheZahl: there's hyperthreading which might give you a small advantage. but probably not worth the effort
 BrunoFelthes: is it the end of the codingame contests?
 gavi: ok, thank you Euler. By the way, is there a nickname that you like for your long name?
 eulerscheZahl: euler is fine. or eul[tab] for autocompletion
 _NikJ: yeah, 2.71828
 derjack: toad
 Astrobytes: Just e
 eulerscheZahl: or Ralph
 _NikJ: That's for codegolf version Astrobytes
 gavi: ok eulerscheZahl (yes, tab is useful to learn)
 eulerscheZahl: so many options
 Astrobytes: lol _NikJ
 eulerscheZahl: back to blogpost
 gavi: Ralph? is it your real name
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 gavi: very well, interesting!
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't think so BrunoFelthes
 derjack: like from the simpsons?
 Astrobytes: fun fact: we all have real names :P
 eulerscheZahl: you are Christopher Align - html formatting expert
 eulerscheZahl: still playing our palindromes game
 Astrobytes: *anagrams
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 LordGrim972: Hi guyss
 Tonecas: hey!
 eulerscheZahl: how did they get this fusion through the cartel office?
 Fast-Byte22: hi
 Astrobytes: cartel?
 Fast-Byte22: si
 eulerscheZahl: antitrust division?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dict.cc/?s=kartellamt">https://www.dict.cc/?s=kartellamt</a>
 Fast-Byte22: Rambo387 do u know him?
 Fast-Byte22: he is gay
 Astrobytes: Ah gotcha
 Fast-Byte22: huh?
 Hery387: he's not talking to u buddy
 Astrobytes: That's the competition and markets authority here
 Astrobytes: Fast-Byte22: behave yourself please, this is not a play area
 Fast-Byte22: ok
 Hery387: Astrobytes: I'm sorry, he's my friend. He is bored or something. It wasn't meant as an offence. Sorry once again&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: just don't do it again and we are fine
 Astrobytes: ^ this
 Hery387: I agree, I told him.
 Tonecas: Friends, i'm starting to get bored doing clashes with python, should i move on to javascript or ruby?
 Zenoscave: Ruby
 Zenoscave: But only focus on code golf with it
 Zenoscave: or perl /shrug
 Astrobytes: Holy Communion Batman! A wild Zeno appears
 Zenoscave: also, Pew Pew
 reCurse: I'm surely massively cynical, but is this why numbers were important this year? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew
 jacek: move on to something other than clashes
 jacek: oO
 Tonecas: Im a bit iliterate with code golf but i'll try
 Tonecas: I use clashes to refine my knowledge of a programming language
 Zenoscave: reCurse are we speaking of the anouncement?
 Tonecas: No need to stop now :grin:
 Astrobytes: reCurse: I'm guessing it's somehow related
 reCurse: Yes, was just curious of others reaction
 reCurse: To me that was 1+1=2
 Zenoscave: My first thought on seeing it was "Oh, THAT'S why"
 Zenoscave: why what, not sure. but it seemed to fit
 reCurse: A lot makes sense to me now
 reCurse: Oh well, gg
 Zenoscave: gg
 Zenoscave: F
 jacek: what numbers? what announcement?
 Zenoscave: check discord jacek
 jacek: thats the last place i check
 Astrobytes: perhaps if you stopped trolling for a moment you'd notice jacek :smirk:
 Zenoscave: jacek, stop trolling? I'll delete my profile if he does
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 struct: jacek has stopped trolling for a while
 Zenoscave: DAMMIT
 Astrobytes: now he does it with derjack instead
 reCurse: Coderpad acquired Codingame, long story short jacek
 eulerscheZahl: really that way and not like meeting in the middle?
 eulerscheZahl: time to read again
 reCurse: If you read between the lines and do some research, it's easy to see who acquired who and "joining forces" is always PR spin for an acquisition
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear&#160;:(
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005040/en/CoderPad-Acquires-CodinGame-to-Improve-Technical-Recruiting-and-Speed-Hiring-Decisions">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005040/en/CoderPad-Acquires-CodinGame-to-Improve-Technical-Recruiting-and-Speed-Hiring-Decisions</a>
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: so we are now the 5% of a &lt;50%?
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: who knows it might end up being good
 reCurse: lol
 struct: its not like cg was taking a good path imo
 reCurse: Maybe I've seen too many acquisition stories
 eulerscheZahl: i'll sit it out and see what happens. nothing I can do about it anyways
 struct: true
 Marchete: :popcorn:
 miszu: does this mean CG got aquired by another company?
 eulerscheZahl: does anyone still use skype?
 eulerscheZahl: yes miszu
 Marchete: me...
 Zenoscave: Have you skyped MK yet? He wants to show some code help
 eulerscheZahl: let me think of another acquisition then... EA buys Westwood?
 miszu: EA bought bioware
 eulerscheZahl: MK uses teamviewer, not skype
 miszu: Microsoft bought Bethesda
 Zenoscave: Ah right. Forgot
 TheBlueBias: Yahoo bought google... Wait... :p
 3141948: &gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005040/en/CoderPad-Acquires-CodinGame-to-Improve-Technical-Recruiting-and-Speed-Hiring-Decisions">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005040/en/CoderPad-Acquires-CodinGame-to-Improve-Technical-Recruiting-and-Speed-Hiring-Decisions</a>Our goose is cooked 😂
 TheBlueBias: From my point that can't be worse than the current management... So meh.
 reCurse: Wait until some things start disappearing
 reCurse: Might have a different opinion
 reCurse: Oh well
 Astrobytes: Like users? :P
 TheBlueBias: ^^
 Marchete: absolutely
 reCurse: I was thinking content but sure maybe
 Marchete: like Clash of Code? dumped
 TheBlueBias: Like bot contests? :smirk:
 Marchete: or all except Clash of Code :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: clash will survive. they even announced a clash session for tomorrow on twitch
 eulerscheZahl: escape will survive too
 Marchete: oh man
 reCurse: Maybe they'll start questioning why they're paying for cloud compute on multiplayer games
 reCurse: Who knows
 Marchete: indeed
 Zenoscave: T.O.D. 1:16 PM UTC.
 jacek: maybe theyll cout payments for moderators :scream:
 jacek: cut
 Marchete: and the first player on the rankings has an ugly toad as avatar? freaks! remove all that!
 eulerscheZahl: cut payments for mods? no more free insults after ban?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Zenoscave: and why do a few of them just say PEWPEW and disappear for months?
 its.Arsh: web dev or android dev?
 jacek: yes
 TheBlueBias: CG (understand the 5% part) is already in deliquescence, so it can continue this way, or improve (I don't think so but who knows? :p ). Can't see how it can be worse (except total deletion of the public site).
 reCurse: I thought you were banned
 eulerscheZahl: his new account isn't
 reCurse: In any case, can always be worse
 jacek: banned?
 eulerscheZahl: baNNed?
 3141948: &gt; baNNed?😱
 ProCoder03: How to change name in my Certificate, I made a typo....
 eulerscheZahl: so, coderpad had another acquisition before: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://coderpad.io/blog/coderpad-expands-technical-interview-capabilities-with-acquisition-of-adaptilab-hiring-product/">https://coderpad.io/blog/coderpad-expands-technical-interview-capabilities-with-acquisition-of-adaptilab-hiring-product/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: does anyone know that platform and how it changed after?
 eulerscheZahl: "This site can’t be reached"
 reCurse: Doesn't mean the terms are the same
 eulerscheZahl: well..
 reCurse: But to me it's pretty clear what their focus is
 Marchete: CodingEscape and Coc?
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait and see. we still have a community that they hopefully want to keep
 reCurse: Wouldn't bet my chips on that one
 eulerscheZahl: and be it just for their polls and market research
 Astrobytes: Assuming they know or care about that
 Marchete: I've been on adquisitions before, depending on the size you can't see any change in months
 Marchete: even years
 eulerscheZahl: i might even watch their clash stream tomorrow
 Marchete: acquisitions*
 Marchete: but it was probably bigger than this
 struct: cant the target be codingame for work?
 Marchete: yes
 Westicles: Hopefully the CG employees made some personal money out of it.  They deserve a reward regardless how it turns out
 KalamariKing: ^
 reCurse: Hope they had equity because otherwise it's probably just a few
 Astrobytes: ^
 3141948: Seems to be a US acquisition
 reCurse: It is
 Astrobytes: Yup
 reCurse: They are all in on tech interviews and probably more strict with unrelated spendings
 reCurse: But Marchete is right, might take a year or two before it happens
 Marchete: Imo you buy companies for three reasons: take out competitors, enter in a market fast, and/or get some feature/tool
 Marchete: pick your choice&#160;:)
 reCurse: 2M+ developer community
 jacek: "developer" who can play clashes
 Marchete: market fast can also be client/asset portfolio
 Astrobytes: Well, they've inherited this motley crew of salty dogs :P
 reCurse: Sorry I'm just allergic to PR spins, this is the treatment
 3141948: &gt; 2M+ developer communityNumber seems to be over estimated
 reCurse: No kidding
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global</a>2,576,857 CodinGamers in this leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Also: "CoderPals"
 eulerscheZahl: definitely all active users
 3141948: Sometimes i think i am alone here lol thanks for these statistics
 Illedan: :sob:
 3141948: I feel better 😉 now
 Astrobytes: heh
 TheBlueBias: Yeah, now you know there's probably unfortunate users who read your messages when you log your code and thoughts in the chat...
 TheBlueBias: :speak_no_evil:
 Illedan: I don't like the Coderpad news. I think it will move the focus of CG somewhere I don't want it to be for too long 
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen this sentence before
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 reCurse: Well, you know, don't be sad it's over, be happy it happened
 Astrobytes: True.
 Illedan: Word
 Illedan: Life moves on
 Astrobytes: And good luck to them moving forward.
 eulerscheZahl: years of fun games for free. and i've also learned a lot on the way that I never planned to learn
 eulerscheZahl: not just the bot coding but also web requests for instance
 Astrobytes: and English grammar/spelling from me
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: "lollygagging"
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Wontonimo: hey
 eulerscheZahl: you missed a lot Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: it was great meeting everyone.  i hope to find a similar space to hang out with everyone here

 Astrobytes: Hey we're not gone just yet Wontonimo :taco:
 Illedan: But in 5
 Illedan: 4
 Illedan: 3
 Marchete: 2
 eulerscheZahl: baby?
 TheBlueBias: Well. That's not over yet, still a few months...
 eulerscheZahl: illedan sent too many messages in too little time
 eulerscheZahl: and got silenced
 Astrobytes: baby?!
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: yes, Ille hates his baby
 Illedan: back, baby was on tv
 Illedan: not
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: he told me, i have proof :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: well, my discord is wontonimo#4591 .  I'd send it to all of you privately, but here is faster
 eulerscheZahl: he was just quickly typing and mixing up contest between 2 sentences to be fair. but it really read like him hating the baby
 eulerscheZahl: why would we need your discord?
 Astrobytes: haha excellent
 miszu: I missed a lot of talk here. Is CG going down or what?
 eulerscheZahl: acquisitioned
 eulerscheZahl: and we are thinking of worst-case scenarios
 miszu: oh okay
 miszu: I don't think they will stop the free thing on this website
 gavi: oh... acquisitioned... in case of worst case scenarios, is there a second best place, similar to his?
 eulerscheZahl: that's the last website that coderpad bought: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.adaptilab.com/">https://www.adaptilab.com/</a>
 gavi: this
 gavi: "This site can’t be reached" wow....
 TheBlueBias: Anyway, all of this is your fault Illedan. You given the permission by upvoting THIS forum post... :angry:
 _NikJ: Huh? What's going on?
 eulerscheZahl: i know exactly WHICH post
 Astrobytes: lol blame Illedan :rofl:
 JoseSantosL: saluton!
 Astrobytes: where are the pitchfork and flaming torch emojis?
 Illedan: sure, I can delete
 TheBlueBias: With the salt one Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: and what makes me even more sad: one of the rare occasions to have an active chat these days
 Astrobytes: Aye, indeed.
 jacek: my fairly active every day
 jacek: but i cant type recently
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah but it's usually just a few of us talking
 Astrobytes: in the worst case, I guess we have to emit some kind of distress signal to other platforms which might take us in :P
 eulerscheZahl: there is RAIC which delayed the contest but i'm optimistic that it will happen
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm relatively confident it will
 eulerscheZahl: yare is very different as it allows human interaction. but could still be interesting and plans a contest within the next 6 months
 struct: maybe it will be like when ubisoft bought nadeo, might be good, who knows :p
 eulerscheZahl: I still haven't tried out LuxAI
 darkhorse64: Most of these platforms are about solving exercises which is not really entertaining
 eulerscheZahl: and board games are? :P
 gavi: in case CG goes south, why don't we create something with a similar feeling to it
 darkhorse64: Yes but not only
 philRG: Since I know there are sentiment analysis softwares all around, I dislike giving my personal feelings
 struct: because the server cost is too high gavi
 philRG: wahooo scrolling failure
 Marchete: do you think it struct?
 struct: running a contest probably reaches the 6 digits
 gavi: yes, but the chat could be on discord and the code could run in the browser, for some languages (those that can compile to webassembly)
 Marchete: 100.000 usd?
 reCurse: Probably more 5 digits if I had to guess
 gavi: one could start from the languages that can run in the browser
 jacek: lets make blockchain based on running games
 Marchete: I doubt it
 Wontonimo: lol jacek
 struct: oh you probably right
 struct: 5 seems more reasonable
 Marchete: 99.999?
 Marchete: that' reasonable
 struct:&#160;:)
 reCurse: It's definitely at least 10k
 gavi: guy, what woul dbe the issue with starting with only webassebly languages?
 gavi: guys
 reCurse: Didn't you start that whole discussion in Discord?
 reCurse: Wasn't it resolved?
 gavi: yes, it was me
 gavi: but now it is more dramatic (if CG should go south)
 gavi: we need to find an alternative
 reCurse: Not really
 reCurse: On that front things didn't change
 reCurse: Can't kill what's already dead
 reCurse: Platform acquisition though does affect more things
 gavi: for my curiosity. if the SDK is for webassemble, the chat on disord and the server is on ly used for rankings... there was an issue of cheating if the code runs in the broweser? nothing that can be solved?
 reCurse: So you want a client to report game results? You don't see any problem with that?
 Astrobytes: Anyway, you can use your new-found free time to pursue other interests, such as goat farming or calligraphy.
 darkhorse64: Rendering teapots on GPU
 gavi: webassembly is not that easy to cheat with. and cheaters can be banned
 reCurse: No that's wrong
 gavi: there would be no  CG-backed things but still the community created would be cool
 TheBlueBias: I've an idea since a few days, without any further thought, and which totally depends on if some are interested or not: What about a "shelter" site for CG's regulars. Like just a chat, or forum, or even simple visit-cards for those who wants to keep contact?
 gavi: yes, let's keep contact, at the very least
 struct: it will probably die pretty fast
 struct: imo
 reCurse: ^
 jacek: do you propose... facebook?
 TheBlueBias: Perhaps. That's why I'm asking. As I said, just a thought.
 gavi: @reCurse the bot might run on the browser of another user, who would not know whose bot is running
 gavi: so there would be no incentive to send fake results
 gavi: bot could be anonimised before running on a random browser
 reCurse: Oh so running arbitrary code on a random user
 darkhorse64: Instead of mining bitcoins, we could mine games
 gavi: but isn't webassembly in a kind of sandbox
 reCurse: Anyway there are a lot of holes
 reCurse: Maybe someone has the time to go through them&#160;:)
 reCurse: Not me
 struct: The similar thing I saw to this was lichess analysis
 struct: When you request computer analysis, a pc is picked from contributors
 struct: or maybe multiple, idk the details
 Astrobytes: huh, I didn't know that
 reCurse: Very different context that is
 struct: ofc
 struct: you would not gain anything by sending wrong data
 dreadylein: you leak the bots to everyone, so you would need to split up binary execution into atomic instructions and then sync them at some hardpoint, its not exectly a trivial problem
 mkkhell: shortest mode in clash of code sucks for C++ programmers&#160;:(

 nitekat: usually ruby is the shortest
 mkkhell: okeyy
 mkkhell: ty
 Wontonimo: dreadylein this can be solved by claiming the code on a blockchain with a hash of the binary
 Marchete: change 1 byte, ezpz
 jacek: :unamused:
 ProCoder03: wow!! I have never seen so many people online...
 eulerscheZahl: bad news summoned us
 nitekat: sorry... what bad news?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005040/en/CoderPad-Acquires-CodinGame-to-Improve-Technical-Recruiting-and-Speed-Hiring-Decisions">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211013005040/en/CoderPad-Acquires-CodinGame-to-Improve-Technical-Recruiting-and-Speed-Hiring-Decisions</a>
 ProCoder03: yeah :disappointed:
 alexr942: first interview next week, absolutely bricking it
 gavi: anyone who would like to brainstorm ideas for a few minutes, about creating a user-driver alternative to CG? 
 gavi: I mean on discrod or eleswhere
 Wontonimo: "over 2 million coders..." :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: we already discussed the drawbacks of WASM. running random code on your machine. leaking bots of other players. manipulating match results
 struct: my multiple accounts helps the stats
 gavi: what about a gaming engine, such as Unity or Godot (that can run ont the web).A DLL might be the referee with hidden tests to pass
 eulerscheZahl: battlesnake and also vindinium before it went down required the user to host the own bot
 KalamariKing: how many of the accounts do you think *are* alts
 gavi: instances would send only the input outputs
 eulerscheZahl: the game server exposes an API that gives the current game state and you send back your action
 eulerscheZahl: the disadvantage here: everyone has to do the own hosting. much more effort to enter the game
 gavi: the DLL in Unity could do something siilar
 gavi: or in Godot (the DLL would be created with an SDK)
 gavi: the game engine to do the graphics locally. The DLL to exchange the status, like in a MMO game
 gavi: eac DLL is one conding challenge/puzzle
 gavi: coding
 Marchete: CG has a pretty good jail to control bots, that's not easy to do.
 eulerscheZahl: halite is open source. the server costs are the problem
 struct: even the  js you can write in the sdk is jailed
 Wontonimo: exactly
 Marchete: distributed won't work, you need similar vCPU
 Marchete: i.e. preemptive VM, the cheaper as you can accept downtimes
 gavi: in the game engine idea, only the bot created by the user runs locally, not other bots
 5922: What are the expected impacts of the acquisition? Do you expect dramatic changes?
 struct: 404
 Marchete: server costs imo are not that "high"
 eulerscheZahl: too early to tell 5922
 Marchete: for one individual it is
 gavi: ha ha 404
 Wontonimo: i see this webchat as probably an early causality.  perhaps turn into a support-only chat if kept at all
 jacek: yeah, current moderators will ne come support
 struct: maybe ill get raised
 eulerscheZahl: future of webchat was discussed long ago. with the possibility of fully moving to discord
 Marchete: n1-standard-64	64 vCPU	240GB		$467.20 / month
 Marchete: not 100.000 USD
 Wontonimo: with which provider?
 Marchete: google cloud preemptible
 Marchete: i.e disposable at will, but multis load are bursts
 struct: with how much cpu usage?
 Wontonimo: okay.  i wonder if there is a 2nd tier provider that costs less
 Marchete: cpu usage?
 Marchete: 100%?
 Wontonimo: 64vcpu 
 struct: no way its 100%
 struct: sorry
 Marchete: trust me, it is&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: yeah, i would think it is
 eulerscheZahl: i trust you, you have experience with it
 struct: how the hell did I paid
 Marchete: :rofl:
 struct: 20€ / 4 hours with 32 vcpus
 struct: I got scammed
 Wontonimo: you didn't buy in bulk and preemptive
 Marchete: because they are dedicated
 struct: ah I see
 Marchete: preemptive is up to 80% cheaper
 Marchete: buuut
 eulerscheZahl: it might just shut down
 Marchete: they can kick you anytime
 _NikJ: Kinda like Azure spot instances?
 Marchete: they do, trust me&#160;;)
 reCurse: I don't think you can use general purpose for compute
 Marchete: azure it's even better
 Marchete: they have batch jobs
 Marchete: pretty nice
 Wontonimo: so, a mix of mostly mostly preemptive for the bot battles, and a small dedicated to host status pages
 Marchete: yep
 Marchete: at some point in my Numbershifting madness, I used both
 Marchete: 100% cpu for days/weeks
 Marchete: they didn't say me a word
 Wontonimo: i'm not an expert on jailing but i have done dev ops.  replicating a bunch of CG would be a huge undertaking unless it is really stripped down
 MSmits: my code is a good boy, doesn't need jail
 struct: its time to go faster MSmits
 struct: you need to solve yavalath / c4 before its gonne
 MSmits: do we really think they will shut this part down?
 struct: no idea
 struct: I think they mostly wanted cg for work
 darkhorse64: It all depends if they see any direct or indirect value for the gaming part
 struct: but is just speculation
 Marchete: he is already 1st on connect4
 MSmits: it's not about rank
 Wontonimo: what is coderpad 's business model atm?
 MSmits: just want to try and solve it&#160;:)
 struct: recruiting
 struct: I think its similar to cg for work
 eulerscheZahl: coding interviews
 Wontonimo: "Hire Confidently withThe Coding Interview Platform"
 Wontonimo: okay, so anything that isn't directly related to that is on the chopping block
 Marchete: btw MSmits will you use your three state idea for C4 =+}
 Marchete:&#160;?
 Marchete: I find it interesting
 MSmits: yeah, to try and solve it
 struct: only offline
 MSmits: it's  4 states btw
 MSmits: empty, p1 filled, p2 filled, irrelevant filled
 Marchete: X O or useless
 Marchete: what's filled?
 MSmits: X or O
 MSmits: p1 or p2
 struct: do you really need empty?
 MSmits: I think so
 MSmits: if something is empty you can play there
 MSmits: which means it takes a turn
 Marchete: but only 3 bitboards
 MSmits: 2 bitboards
 struct: well if it doesnt have a x or o its empty right?
 MSmits: a single bitboard takes 2 states per cell
 MSmits: two bitboards take 4 states
 Marchete: weird but ok
 MSmits: yes struct
 MSmits: if a p1 bit is set, it's X, if a p2 bit is set it's O. If no bit is set it's empty, if both bits are set it's filled but useless
 Wontonimo: from the statement on coderpad
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/286eab6f-6fc9-48a5-9098-85a493eb44b2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/286eab6f-6fc9-48a5-9098-85a493eb44b2</a>
 Wontonimo: so it really is focused on the hiring assessment 
 Wontonimo: not the competitions
 Marchete: TLDR: CG for work
 Wontonimo: yup
 Marchete: who knows
 Marchete: "employee engagement mechanisms"
 MSmits: that's when employees agree to get married
 Wontonimo: lol
 [CG]Thibaud: still, it doesn't mean CG will shut down. Maybe I'm super naive
 Wontonimo: i don't think CG will shut down
 Wontonimo: but, like everything, change is ever present
 struct: I just dont see the benefit of keeping it if the target was cg for work
 MSmits: perhaps they can think of a way to do more recruiting through this part of CG
 eulerscheZahl: we'll just have to wait and see i guess. you as a community manager being positive gives me some hope. for us it's "just" a website to spent our free time. for you it's what pays the rent: dealing with us grumpy nerds :D
 Marchete: maybe it has double use
 [CG]Thibaud: this community is an incredible asset for CG business, can be the same for CoderPad. Even more as CoderPad customers are devs, nor HR
 Marchete: get CG for work, but also the Coding Escape + contests + 2M devel base
 Wontonimo: and employees
 MSmits: [CG]Thibaud in what way has the community been an incredible asset to CG business?
 eulerscheZahl: i'll probably even have a look at your twitch stream tomorrow. not that I would care about clashing. just to see who the new owners are
 MSmits: just wondering
 [CG]Thibaud: branding, + indirect lead generation
 darkhorse64: If CG for gamers had not value for CG, it would have long be gone
 Marchete: the bad thing is that competitive hardcore geeks comes in that pack
 MSmits: ahh ok
 [CG]Thibaud: our clients know CG for Work because they know CG
 MSmits: darkhorse64 it could have had marked funding in some way
 MSmits: from outside source, i dont know how this works
 MSmits: (like a donation for a company specifically to keep the community part)
 MSmits: from
 Marchete: maybe these white collar don't know, but right here some bots on multis are much MUCH better than state of the art papers around there
 reCurse: It gave numbers for the exit strategy :p
 reCurse: (admittedly cynical)
 Marchete: it's a pity we could lose that
 MSmits: that's true Marchete competition has that effect
 Marchete: I think more on multis
 MSmits: so do i
 Marchete: ahh ok
 21stCenturyPeon: But how will I pass the time while I'm waiting for builds?
 MSmits: I hear great things about solitaire 
 Wontonimo: the multis have sure improved my optimization skills like nothing else
 21stCenturyPeon: My regex is so much better thanks to CoC.
 jacek: is it feature?
 MSmits: I think mostly for me it trained computational thinking. I can figure out a solution to a coding problem much quicker than before I found this platform
 ProCoder03: yeah same to me&#160;!!
 [CG]Thibaud: btw, the change in contest format is not related (to my knowledge) to CoderPad
 MSmits: I didn't assume it was.
 reCurse: Let's be real though, the concern about numbers make sense in the light of this
 MSmits: which numbers are you talking about reCurse?
 reCurse: Part of the reasoning given for not having CCs or more contests
 jacek: 4 8 15 16 23 42 
 MSmits: oh ok
 reCurse: I mean if you go about stating a 2M+ developer community
 reCurse: Gotta be real
 MSmits: well... regardless of the numbers, if a sum offered is large enough companies do sell
 reCurse: Of course
 MSmits: so in that sense it may just have been a great offer
 reCurse: Sure
 reCurse: That's completely orthogonal
 Wontonimo: there is a lot of value to all the multis, puzzles, and optis so i don't see them going away quickly
 reCurse: Value is in the eye of the beholder
 reCurse: I can see them eventually questioning the funding put into even maintaining this
 reCurse: Not to mention maintaining two separate platforms more or less doing the same thing (to them) is questionable
 reCurse: It's like the basic textbook of mergers
 struct: 4 platforms in total I think
 struct: tech io, cg, cg escape, cg for work
 reCurse: I was thinking coderpad's versus CG's as a whole wrt interviews
 struct: ah I see
 [CG]Thibaud: it's quite complementary so far
 reCurse: Eliminating redundant costs is the first step though
 [CG]Thibaud: they do live interviews mainly, we do take-homes assessments + retain offers
 Wontonimo: that's great to hear [CG]Thibaud
 reCurse: I have the feeling they'll question the value of multis sooner or later
 reCurse: We'll see
 MSmits: even if they question it, that still makes it a question
 reCurse: The act of questioning implies a direction
 MSmits: I would imagine all parts of an acquired company get placed under a microscope
 MSmits: so it's one big question
 MSmits: point is, we have no idea 
 reCurse: CG was already seeing less value in it, I don't see how a pure technical interview company suddenly will lol
 reCurse: They can have a sustainable community just off puzzles and clashes
 Astrobytes: I don't share [CG]Thibaud's optimism unfortunately, having gone through acquisitions previously, but we'll have to wait and see.
 MSmits: you'd need the full picture to judge that properly I think
 reCurse: Sure, that would certainly eliminate 99% of conversations
 eulerscheZahl: we still have this possible copyright topic that coderpad inherited now. looking at you BotG
 MSmits: topic? 
 reCurse: No offense meant but it's Thibaud's job to be optimistic&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Fair&#160;:)
 MSmits: mmh I am optimistic too...
 struct: time to rename the board games 
 MSmits: :moneybag:&#160;?
 MSmits: don't all these names fall under parody protection?
 Astrobytes: Yavalaugh, Orwello, Chase, Connect Users...
 reCurse: IANAL
 eulerscheZahl: iAnal? the new apply heath device?
 eulerscheZahl: apple*
 Astrobytes: "I am not a lawyer" :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: *health
 eulerscheZahl: my spelling
 miszu: it will have a smelly smell
 jacek: UANAL too?
 [CG]Thibaud: I'll take care of these, i've started with Skynet ep1 but community content is less of an issue for now
 eulerscheZahl: aah, the messages from reCurse and Astrobytes are related. I only understood now that I looked up the acronym
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 [CG]Thibaud: if I was scared about the merge, I think I'd left the company tbh
 Wontonimo: well, speculating is starting to make me tired.  so, i'm going to log off for today.  See you all tomorrow&#160;!  :wave: 
 MSmits: bye Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: see ya later Wontonimo

 eulerscheZahl: artwork still says skynet revolution
 Astrobytes: Death First Search :D
 MSmits: it's a good name
 eulerscheZahl: my proposal was accepted
 reCurse: But the goal is to survive first :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't remember for which game I made it
 gavi: ha ha
 gavi: (ops, it was about a previous joke)
 Marchete: Lol we are now like these aliexpress knock off
 darkhorse64: I see an acronym for BFS but it's nsfw
 reCurse: Not if it's about a chicken factory
 jacek: breast...?
 Marchete: metalman, waterman, greenman
 darkhorse64: yes, it's about chicks
 [CG]Thibaud: oh I forgot about the logo
 eulerscheZahl: that nice bit of Tonton memory&#160;:(

 Astrobytes: But it's the furniture of law enforcement!
 MSmits: haha i did not even see that
 MSmits: is that real?
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't be surprised, I've seen some highly suspect fake goods at markets in my time
 MSmits: in the 60s?
 TheBlueBias: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Cheeky ****! You're older than me!
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: true  :grin:
 jacek: oO
 P0sitive: :grin:
 veganmeatball: I'm trying to write clash of code problems in c but I always get beat up by pyhton users Is there some kind of tactic for code size in c?
 miszu: if it is for code size python has advantage because it doesn't require main method
 jacek: MSmits rotating board should be equivalent as changing players in chess-like games no?
 struct: a1 becomes h8
 Manjius: hello any c# dev wanna clash with me? i wanna learn it
 jacek: at least in oware it worked. but as you know i have double inputs for player to move in NN
 jacek: yet doubling is still slightly better than rotating
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ASdBXLV.png">https://i.imgur.com/ASdBXLV.png</a> blue is doubling, brown is rotating. brown has 2x less weights so it would fit on CG. blue wouldn't&#160;:(
 struct: this is due to what?
 struct: the rotation makes it slower?
 jacek: negligible. im trying to figure it out
 jacek: is it really equivalent, or maybe not really. is there is some bug in my code
 struct: can your rotation be wrong?
 jacek: :shrug:
 RoboStac: what do you mean by chess like? (chess doesn't rotatable exactly as queen / kings are opposites)
 jacek: onitama
 jacek: welp in there i also exchange cards
 RoboStac: ah, haven't looked at that to know enough about what would work
 jacek: i have some wild idea
 jacek: robo do you rotate in bt? or distinquish a player to move in some way
 struct: I do rotate but it was slower, on NN might not have that much impact on performance
 RoboStac: rotate
 jacek: i used half of the weights from the blue into rotated game. it works!
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 jacek: so i have some weapon to deploy in case someone overtakes me in onitama :imp:
 struct: damn my bot was ready
 struct: it had 60%+ win rate vs yours
 jacek: on those solved openings?
 struct: are there any solved openings on the cg version?
 jacek: there will be all if i have something to say
 jacek: oh my and it seems to be working in bt as well :tada:
 struct: submit 
 jacek: it will be the same
 struct: ah is just so you can have more weights?
 jacek: but i can train new one with 2x weights, probably will be better despite a little slower
 jacek: eeyup
 KefMambo: jacek
 jacek: :thinking:
 jacek: but i think im gonna use doubling in training. maybe there is some unneccessary weight sharing during training
 struct: what does doubling in training mean?
 jacek: i mean the weights
 jacek: training will be all the same. just for CG i will use the useful half
 KefMambo: do you know young leosia?
 jacek: the who?
 JacobTheCoder: hi
 fischen: hello
 niluthebear: :wave:
 titanshange: how tf do i code
 notanonymous77: hrrrm
 jacek: hmph
 MSmits: not sure how you code tensorflow. it seems like a lot of work
 jacek: delete system32
 MSmits: wrong window jacek, use cmd first
 miszu: when I was like 8, I did delete system32 so I could install a racing game. The HDD only had 1.2 GB and the game took like 600 MB. I saw system32 was taking a lot of space and proceeded to delete it.
 MSmits: like a prodigy
 MSmits: parents probably liked that :P
 miszu: as a young age I learned how OS worked pretty fast
 MSmits: I just played games
 miszu: when I was like 13 I installed arch linux on my laptop
 KalamariKing: MSmits tensorflow isn't too bad, just takes a little getting used to. they have TONS of tutorials and such that I used to help learn what I was doing
 MSmits: KalamariKing I was responding to titanshange. Scroll up&#160;:)
 MSmits: but thanks anyway!
 KalamariKing: haha didnt see that
 jacek: youre quite furrious
 MSmits: and fast
 KalamariKing: jacek pfp checks out
 jacek: pvp?
 jacek: kids these days and their abbreviations
 KalamariKing: smh my head
 KalamariKing: pfp? profile picture?
 jacek: oO
 Bestar: hi
 Astrobytes: Surely 'pfp' in that sense should be 'pp'. Or just use 'avatar'.
 jacek: pp?
 Astrobytes: back in your box
 jacek: i think outside of the box
 Astrobytes: you can still do that but remain inside it
 pihack: hello my frnd
 pihack: i have some question
 jacek: well?
 niluthebear: in Coders Strike Back the first introduction part in Constraints section 0 ≤ thrust ≤ 100 part, 1 is not blue :p
 jacek: huh? it is blue
 jacek: at least in legends the 200
 niluthebear: :o it's blue in other leagues
 pihack: the beast language for bigins?
 pihack: and can i write backend with js
 jacek: everything can written with js. but is it worth it?
 Astrobytes: and is it beastly enough?
 struct: c++ is the best for beginners
 struct: or c
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1: from me
 Astrobytes: unless you want to do web dev
 Astrobytes: in which case you should 100% learn CFML /s
 Uljahn: today even Fortran has web frameworks
 struct: holy
 struct: it still gets updates
 Astrobytes: fortran? Ofc
 struct: I need to stop valuing pieces on loa

 Nixerrr: I'm here to re-learn coding
 Nixerrr: Will follow struct's advice and start with c
 Astrobytes: re-learn lol, too much time in the gym?
 Nixerrr: Not the gym sadly. I've been redoing our home...
 Astrobytes: Ah, even more work
 Nixerrr: I thought I liked DIY
 Astrobytes: that's always the case until you do a large project
 Nixerrr: Anyhow, no sleep until legend!
 Astrobytes: hahaha yesss :D
 Nixerrr: :point_up:
 jacek: legend? where?
 Nixerrr: Not sure yet
 3141948: &gt; but im ending games with 12 piecesWell done I should improve mine

 Astrobytes: as do we all
 Illedan: :pray:
 matez: Due to this acquisition, the language level counting changed?(Unknown level)&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: matez: I believe that's a bug that will be 
 jacek: :scream:
 matez: you can instead solve a max 45 mins 4 puzzle certificate exam. which makes sense, unless the puzzles are quite easy.
 Westicles: not a bug... a proper communication will be done later
 matez: I just was training to solve some puzzles to improve my language skill meter then it is no more necessary&#160;:)
 Scarfield: my language level is simply too high to express other than "unknown"

 Wontonimo: and their bot is close to yours but a bit worse, then you will gain points
 Wontonimo: and that can push you over the boss&#160;!
 Wontonimo: you don't actually have to beat the boss
 Wontonimo: just the score
 Wontonimo: Thorcode I haven't even attempted Ghost in the Cell
 Wontonimo: congrats on getting to Bronze
 Wontonimo: oh, this is very much like a space galactic war game from the early 80s
 Thorcode: thanks Wontonimo
 Thorcode: this game is harder
 Wontonimo: than what?
 Thorcode: space galactic
 Wontonimo: probably
 Wontonimo: let's see, the wood3 boss seems to only send 2 or 3 troops at a time
 Thorcode: look at bronze Won
 Wontonimo: aarrg ... keeping track of the troops enroute is not something i'm looking forward to
 struct: which game?
 struct: a gitc
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: gitc
 Thorcode: the troops look crazy
 struct: i have no idea how to play it
 struct: I would probably focus on spreading troops on my side of the board and the middle planet
 struct: easier said than done ofc
 Wontonimo: i'm just pondering the datastructure i'd use
 struct: just a normal graph should work no?
 Wontonimo: would it be fast though?
 Wontonimo: i'm thinking a NxN for the factory2factory distance
 struct: When I see py3 at the top I dont care too much about speed
 Wontonimo: oh, i didn't look at the leaderboard.  good point
 Wontonimo: haha 
 Wontonimo: num1 and 4 is python.  good point
 struct: even php on 8th
 struct: maybe I can try this game since im very weak on graphs and probably need to get bette ron them
 struct: better on*
 struct: the problem will be the heuristics I think 
 struct: for the ai
 struct: also the bombs is something I kinda dislike
 Wontonimo: generally it looks like all troops are sent every round with nothing really held back.  bombs used very early
 struct: yeah if the factory is not gonna get attacked you can send the troops that are in that factory I think
 struct: should be safe
 struct: unless theres an enemy factory closer to you
 Wontonimo: here is what i'm observing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/568106920">https://www.codingame.com/replay/568106920</a>
 Wontonimo: wow, the top are some really old submits from 2017 and 2019
 miszu: I wasn't able to get out of silver with that game
 miszu: but I should give it a try later
 miszu: I got tired with those competition so I do simple puzzle&#160;:)
 struct: Im bad at puzzles
 struct: like really bad
 miszu: how is that possible?
 miszu: puzzles are easier than competitions
 struct: not for me
 miszu: do you have a degree in CS?
 miszu: just curious
 struct: no
 KalamariKing: idk, the comps are easier in a way
 miszu: ok I understand. Lots of knowledge you can use to solve the problems
 miszu: hard to connect the dots
 struct: its more like I can solve cg puzzles
 struct: but I cant solve cf puzzles
 Wontonimo: my greatest issue with the puzzles is expectations.  if I set my expectation to be 6 hours for easy and x2 for each step up then I don't get upset with myself for not solving it fast enough
 struct: Specially math ones
 miszu: Today I did 5 medium ones
 miszu: I am doing the ones that have achievements
 struct: nice
 Wontonimo: but i keep thinking i should be able to do any puzzle in half an hour and then i get mad at my progress
 miszu: don't put time pressure
 KalamariKing: same lmao
 miszu: think of the problem and then solve it
 Wontonimo: self set expectations are my greatest issue
 miszu: sometimes come back later
 miszu: some problems are not obvious if you don't see how to solve it
 struct: at least here most have a viewer
 struct: it helps
 KalamariKing: definitely
 struct: one day ill get a color on cf :p
 miszu: my issue is that I see a solution but too lazy to type it
 miszu: like man... need to type like 200 lines of code
 miszu: can I make it shorter somehow?
 struct: My problem sometimes is not knowing the solution
 struct: unless is math related
 miszu: I did that to one of the medium ones
 struct: my problem is understanding the statement
 miszu: some of them are not obvious/ambiguious
 miszu: like the cable network
 miszu: I thought that each house needs a unique path of cable
 miszu: not knowing they can go on top of each toher
 miszu: anyhow, brb in 1h
 Thorcode: I will solve two hard puzzle to day&#160;:)
 struct: damn solved that one 4-5 years ago :p
 Wontonimo: well, very hard puzzles are just whatever time it takes.  i've been thinking over some of there for a while now
 Wontonimo: no, that's a lie.  i've given up on some of them for a while now
 Thorcode: nice
 struct: cg official i only solved 2 hard ones
 struct: roller coaster, I brute forced it
 struct: and the surface i copy pasted my floodfill from stc
 struct: the bruteforce works on js but doesnt work on c++
 Thorcode: stc?
 struct: smash the code
 struct: is a multiplayer
 KalamariKing: some of these practices are more like clashes... and others are stupid hard (to me and my limited experience&#160;;-;)
 Thorcode: what is your rank in that
 struct: Like top 100 I think
 Thorcode: oh legend league
 struct: I never finished my bot&#160;:(
 Thorcode: I in wood 1
 Thorcode:  I will watch you
 struct: Maybe one day ill go back to it
 struct: the code is a mess
 struct: oh now I remember why I never started gitc
 KalamariKing: lmao
 Thorcode: the puzzle is not really at all
 Thorcode: easy
 struct: which one?
 Thorcode: roller coaster
 struct: yeah
 struct: I still remember it I think
 Thorcode: why the last is 100
 Thorcode: I was think that plus all the pi is the solution
 struct: dont think its math related
 Verdi: hows it going everyone
 KalamariKing: not bad not bad hbu
 Verdi: nice, im not doing so bad myself
 Wontonimo: do you mostly play clashes Verdi&#160;?
 Thorcode:&#160;? what do you mean struct?
 Thorcode: this is not math?
 struct: plus all the pi?
 Thorcode: yep
 struct: ah Pi is a variable name
 Verdi: is that a whisper? also no im doing some of the easy practices as we speak
 struct: no he just typed your name here and it shows as red
 Wontonimo: when it is red it is because your name was used
 Wontonimo: without your name
 Wontonimo: with Verdi
 Thorcode: pi it's input
 Verdi: noted Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: :D
 <b>**Thorcode slaps Thorcode around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: but people can go on a ride again
 Wontonimo: you may find Tron <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tron-battle">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tron-battle</a> fun, if you like that sort of thing.  it's pretty easy to get into, turn left if you are about to hit something
 Thorcode: I can move out of the grid right? (in Tron)
 struct: no
 Thorcode:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: maybe if you smash into the side in the same place several times
 Wontonimo: weaken down the wall
 Thorcode: really
 Wontonimo: lol :D no
 Thorcode:  I got die
 Thorcode: you joke me
 Wontonimo: that would be a really cool easter egg in the game
 Thorcode: the third line is my oppent x y right
 Wontonimo: i don't know the instructions for the beginning league but you can scroll down and look at the game input statement
 Wontonimo: it is on the left
 KalamariKing: is it weird speaking one language and programming in another? for those who this applies
 Wontonimo: for legend you get N lines, one for each player.
 struct: dont think so
 struct: I code in english
 Wontonimo: each line has X0 Y0 X1 Y1
 struct: even my comments are in english
 Wontonimo: what are you talking about struct?
 struct: answering kalamari question
 KalamariKing: going through puzzle "best solutions" its kinda weird being able to read the code but not the comments
 Thorcode: 4 line
 Wontonimo: oh, never mind ... i read
 Wontonimo: hey, it is the same as legend
 Thorcode: 4 line is max
 Wontonimo: i logged into my alt account and checked
 Wontonimo: read the game input section of the instructions
 Wontonimo: it is on the left, scroll down 
 struct: the for loop gives the x and y for all active bots
 Wontonimo: "Line 1: Two integers N and P. Where N is the total number of players and P is your player number for this game."
 Thorcode: I read it
 Wontonimo: "The N following lines: One line per player. First line is for player 0, next line for player 1, etc.  ..."
 Wontonimo: you are not necessarily always player 0 or 1.  you need to read P
 Thorcode: i need more pathfinding
 Thorcode: logic
 Wontonimo: what league are you in?
 Thorcode: to avoid my oppenet
 Thorcode: wood 2
 Thorcode: I don't know how to avoid them
 Wontonimo: nope, just turn left if there is something infront of you
 Thorcode: that stupid
 Wontonimo: otherwise go straight
 Wontonimo: not for wood 2
 Thorcode: if my left is wall
 miszu: which game is that?
 Thorcode: then ...................
 miszu: ghost?
 Wontonimo: Tron
 KalamariKing: turn left again
 KalamariKing: ez
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tron-battle">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tron-battle</a>
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: why I'm so stupid
 miszu: is tron a new game?
 Wontonimo: nope, old
 Thorcode: no
 miszu: it's like a snake game right?
 Thorcode: yep
 Programer171: hi
 Thorcode: like worm.io
 Programer171: hi
 miszu: ok yeah
 KalamariKing: yeah kinda
 Programer171: can anyone see my messages?
 KalamariKing: yeah
 KalamariKing: hello
 Programer171: hello
 Wontonimo: hi Programer171
 Programer171: is this a discord?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: no
 Wontonimo: no, it is a webchat
 Thorcode: but this is harder than worm.io that I can't move in my own body&#160;:(
 Programer171: if so how is this possible?
 Programer171: oh
 Programer171: ok
 Programer171: i thought this was a discord
 struct: there should be a link above to join discord
 Programer171: wouldu join my clash?
 Programer171: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/201449159181adecb6dd7282a56114ad263158a">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/201449159181adecb6dd7282a56114ad263158a</a>
 miszu: another puzzle solved&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: woot.  which one?
 Programer171: does anyone wants to join my clash?
 Programer171: pls?

 Programer171: ok
 codeing: hello guys
 Wontonimo: hello
 codeing: sup&#160;?
 Programer171: hello
 Wontonimo: codin
 codeing: yes
 Wontonimo: was looking at tron
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tron-battle">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tron-battle</a>
 codeing: cool
 codeing: what do you yhink about the puzzle of this week&#160;?
 codeing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/sum-of-spirals-diagonals">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/sum-of-spirals-diagonals</a>
 Wontonimo: i did it a month ago before it was the puzzle of the week.  it was fun
 codeing: can you make feedback on my code&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i'd rather not
 Wontonimo: tell me at a high level what you are doing
 Wontonimo: either pseudo code or just plain word descripton
 codeing: building the spiral matrix &amp; sum diagonal
 Wontonimo: it won't fit in memory
 Wontonimo: the matrix can be up to 2^32 in width
 Wontonimo: which is 2^64 items in the matrix
 Wontonimo: that's approximately 10^18
 Wontonimo: personally, i think this puzzle should have been ranked as "medium".  I think "easy" puzzles should be able to be solved via brute force by doing what you suggest
 prawin: hello world
 Wontonimo: you need to come up with something a little more elegant and performant 
 Wontonimo: look at the second sequence1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 = 80
 Wontonimo: do you see a pattern?
 SAL9000: @Wontonimo For this case probably memory may not be a prob (Note N &lt; 1500) but yeah still not elegant/efficient
 Wontonimo: oh, right, N is &lt; 1500.  I thought N &lt; 2^32
 Wontonimo: you are correct SAL9000
 Wontonimo: okay, you may be able to brute force it codeing&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: btw SAL9000 , you don't need to put the "@" in front of peoples name
 Wontonimo: :wave: new names I've never seen before
 Wontonimo: hey prawin and SAL9000
 SAL9000: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a489f44e-ad34-4a9a-8a0a-a1dd2d6c8ae2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a489f44e-ad34-4a9a-8a0a-a1dd2d6c8ae2</a>
 SAL9000: Uh long chats go to pastebin? :grimacing:
 Wontonimo: hehe
 Wontonimo: i used to have that happen to me a lot 
 Wontonimo: well SAL9000 , you came the day that CodinGame got sold to some other recruiting company
 SAL9000: And besides I'm bit shy person and doesn't pop up much on conversations. Just happened to be in pazzle of the week so I could get a certification and noticed your conversation
 SAL9000: Oh is it?
 Wontonimo: i think we are all shy, that's why we program
 SAL9000: :joy:
 Wontonimo: do you do any bot battles SAL?
 SAL9000: You mean AI bot programming? (Solo/Multiplayer contest) or Code of Clash?
 SAL9000: (Or clash of code whatever)
 Wontonimo: the multi player stuff
 SAL9000: I used to
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 SAL9000: But didn't had chance to do in for a year or so now
 Wontonimo: oh wow, yeah you were on this site a long time ago
 Wontonimo: there are lots of new bot programming multis now
 Wontonimo: and the competition has become pretty impressive at the top
 SAL9000: yeah

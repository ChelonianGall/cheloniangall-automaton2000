 Qleo: what do you do if you wanted to do math in java
 gopikrishna000: pranav how u found i m blnd
 Thyl: Hello
 Thyl:&#160;!
 SuryaTheOP: haii guys
 KiwiTae: o/
 Husoski: @Qleo What kind of math.  The Math class has all the stock "math" functions, and java.math has a couple of large number classes, but for symbolics or vector/matrix manipulations, complex analysis, combinatorics, most statistics, etc. you need to find outside libraries or write your own.
 Qleo: nevermind you juts have to use int
 derjack: oO

 BlaiseEbuth: No
 Scarfaith: ok&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: -&gt; #clash
 nothansk: i did the same thing and i didn't know but i got kicked lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Depends of the moderator and of his mood... :3
 derjack: mooderators :unamused:
 nothansk: mod can i get some help pls
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?
 nothansk: yesterday someone spammed a msg
 nothansk: and we both had like the same first four msges
 nothansk: letters i man
 nothansk: mean
 nothansk: on my other account
 nothansk: and then i got banned
 nothansk: when i didn't do anything that violated any rules
 nothansk: so&#160;:|
 BlaiseEbuth: What's your other account name?
 nothansk: uh
 nothansk: nickeyminasj lol
 BlaiseEbuth: -_-
 nothansk: i think i was banned wrongly coz when i tried to @ the other guy i pressed tab and @ed myself
 nothansk: idk
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... You're not the one who spammed but you started the chain...
 nothansk: nono
 nothansk: i didn't intend on it
 nothansk: u can see
 nothansk: i just did like /me cry or smth like that
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes. And someone answered "cry" and you said "cry" again, and then the spam started...
 nothansk: i sent 2 msges...
 stefano.panarelli: who support gay pride?
 BlaiseEbuth: You've also spoke of pinaples on pizzas, that's a ban motif...
 stefano.panarelli: TRUE
 nothansk: oh shit...
 stefano.panarelli: i'm italian
 nothansk: i didn't say it was good tho
 nothansk: i said thoughts??
 BlaiseEbuth: Right.
 nothansk: lol
 nothansk: anyway was there a reason listed for my ban
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably what I said before: voluntarily or not you started the spam chain... Just a guess, I'm just reading the chat logs, and don't know who banned you...
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway, you have a new account with almost the same level, so take care of this one. ^^
 nothansk: so there's no way to unban &lt;/3
 BlaiseEbuth: Not easily. Need to ask the CM to directly edit the blacklist.
 Ghostgate: unbsn nothsnks or riot!
 nothansk: personally i think pineapple on pizzas is horrendous&#160;;) do i deserve unban now
 Ghostgate: i take it back. permaban nothansk"
 nothansk: oh shit
 nothansk: &lt;/3
 Ghostgate: pineapples are fuggin tasty
 stefano.panarelli: not on pizza my friend

 OnsCH: Hello Everyone, Does anyone know the solution for the famous coin change problem ( cashier and the minimal amount of bills)? I need help solving it. Thanks 
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hi guys, I need to solve the problem "how to get rich", can anybody help me on this
 darkhorse64: not here
 JimmyJams: step 1 put all savings in doge coin
 JimmyJams: step 2&#160;??
 MiyamuraIzumi: ha ha
 JimmyJams: step 3 rich
 MiyamuraIzumi: we will broke with step 1
 MiyamuraIzumi: so no other steps
 MiyamuraIzumi: another quite interest problem "how to have a beautiful girl friend".
 JimmyJams: step 1 be attractive
 JimmyJams: step 2 don't be unattractive
 MiyamuraIzumi: I have another solution
 MiyamuraIzumi: solve "rich problem" =&gt; "girl friend problem" solved
 JimmyJams: this is true
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 ableflyer: i don't know if this is a good idea, but here it is
 ableflyer: fall guys but coding
 ableflyer: yea not good is it

 KP56: you mean clash of code?
 KP56: you can create a private room
 MSmits: get a room
 MSmits: hi btw
 geppoz: hi MSmits
 MSmits: schoolyear is winding down
 MSmits: couple more tasks and then it's more or less done
 MSmits: 2 more weeks
 geppoz: thx for your hint, I got 15th my connect4 MCTS solver (in JS!)
 MSmits: nice job geppoz
 MSmits: which hint was this?
 MSmits: I talk a lot
 geppoz: hint = the MCTS solver article
 MSmits: ohh ok
 geppoz: I kinda "invented" some like that, by pruning math wins or losses
 geppoz: but that failed because not scoring correctly
 MSmits: ahh ok
 geppoz: so that article clarified some things :D
 MSmits: i hope you didnt copy the pseudo code literally (from the article)
 MSmits: it's poorly coded there
 geppoz: no, that was not clear at all
 TotM-youtube: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1832613d1615b5d9b32164bee42b2eb5457973e">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1832613d1615b5d9b32164bee42b2eb5457973e</a>
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: I think the pseudo code is recursive. I have nothing against that, but when a while loop will do just fine...
 MSmits: I just count backwards using the same list of selected nodes I use for backpropagatiin
 derjack: mcts solver paper? :scream:
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: hey btw, almost done with 35 seeds book
 MSmits: then probably 5 days or so for 36 seeds and I am done
 derjack: all in this heat?
 MSmits: i turn it off when my room temperature goes over 25
 geppoz: :D
 MSmits: didnt happen very often
 MSmits: also, this is not energy intensive, i dont use more than 1 core
 MSmits: no point because the bottleneck is lookups
 derjack: youre getting so low. top6 is all nn now
 MSmits: struct got in too?
 derjack: in oware
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: did struct also get into top&#160;?
 derjack: i dont see struct
 MSmits: thought he was running marchete version
 derjack: its jolindie
 MSmits: oh it's jolindie n
 MSmits: wonder if it's his own concoction or marchetes
 derjack: he said it was marchetes
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: I'll get there, no worries, the summer vacation is long&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am guessing 3rd place is possible for me. Beating you and robo seems hard. You guys went through several generations of improvement
 MSmits: anyway gotta go, train arriving, ttyl&#160;:)
 derjack: its meh to improve. my last version was beating the previous by ~60%, but it the same on worse in leaderboard
 samiriscool: ay gamers
 geppoz: ay
 samiriscool: wys geppoz
 samiriscool: how u guys doin
 geppoz: learning some MCTS with connect4
 samiriscool: oooo ok ok you on the grind then?
 geppoz: doing it in JS, just to easily experiment
 geppoz: when done I will port it in c++
 samiriscool: big moves
 samiriscool: i respect the dedication
 geppoz: connect4 seems the right "sparring partner" for first implementation
 geppoz: easy enough to experiment
 samiriscool: yeah not that tough but respectable
 geppoz: final target: porting it in totoro challenge :D
 samiriscool: niiiiiiiiice aiming high i see
 geppoz: :D
 samiriscool: good luck man
 samiriscool: imma dip 
 geppoz: and you doing?
 samiriscool: i'm just clashing
 samiriscool: you know how it is
 samiriscool: how is everyone else doing

 kyoya34: gucci
 kyoya34: anyone in here knows cpp'
 KiwiTae: ya
 KP56: what do you need to know
 BlaiseEbuth: The truth
 kyoya34: bruh..any tips on manipulating strings
 KP56: eh
 KP56: what do you need to do exactly
 kyoya34: extracting integers from strings..splitting strings..etc etc
 KP56: oh
 BlaiseEbuth: Should I link the doc of std::string&#160;? :thinking:
 KP56: stoi(string) -&gt; transforms string to an int
 kyoya34: noice
 KP56: splitting... i think there is a split function
 kyoya34: really?
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 kyoya34: i should really study standard functions from string.h
 BlaiseEbuth: use a stringstream
 kyoya34: oh yeah..i have used stringstream..but not exactly getting it right
 KP56: oh i remember i coded  a split function because there was not you are right blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: You create your stringstream with your string, then you can extract substring with getline(yourstream, astring, 'd') d being the char to split on.
 kyoya34: one more thing..how do i reduce my code size
 kyoya34: oh..thankyou blaise

 kyoya34: k bye
 LazyMammal: `vector&lt;string&gt; tokens{istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;{iss},istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;{}};`
 LazyMammal: that will split on space to make a vector of words
 KP56: nice
 KP56: even better
 KP56: i usually code in java but had to switch to c++ recently
 kyoya34: ooh nice
 KP56: because Java is TOO SLOW
 kyoya34: anything to reduce code size in cpp?
 KP56: if you want to do shortest clashes of code use js, ruby or python
 LazyMammal: #define C std::cout&lt;&lt;
 KP56: didnt know you can do that
 kyoya34: ooh..i tried that...but i didnt include &lt;&lt; this at the end and kept geting error
 LazyMammal: be careful with whitespaceC varnameC(expr)
 kyoya34: thankyou for that mate
 LazyMammal: sometimes for many lib calls
 LazyMammal: but usually I only have
 kyoya34: i can never beat python with my cpp in code size clash
 sapfeer0k: you can never bit ruby guy with python in size clash
 sapfeer0k: its a life
 kyoya34: geez
 MiyamuraIzumi: I can never beat Python with Java
 MiyamuraIzumi: in size clash

 BlaiseEbuth: read -r a b c d
 MiyamuraIzumi: now for UTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
 kyoya34: can i ask something
 kyoya34: can i edit the ide in order for it to display my started code evrytime?\
 BlaiseEbuth: You just did. But you can do it again
 kyoya34: is it possible?
 BlaiseEbuth: Not on the site. Possibly with a browser extension/script
 kyoya34: ok cool
 kyoya34: i just wanted to know if by using this anyone can get a heads up in the fastest mode in coc
 LazyMammal: keyboard macro?  autohotkey?  clipboard?  Tampermonkey?

 NasrAllah: LazyMammal thanks a lot &lt;3
 NasrAllah: uh I want short one for ruby too :3
 BlaiseEbuth: Go find it yourself.
 GaelEatsToes: this is so sad
 GaelEatsToes: can we hit r50 like
 LazyMammal: Ebuth, that response is either very helpful (get stronk by doing it yourself) or very dismissive (I can't be bothered).  
 MiyamuraIzumi: I know only abit about python, and can still find it for myself
 MiyamuraIzumi: so find it yourself
 BlaiseEbuth: Both. But not dismissive because I don't want to be bothered. The guys don't ask precise question, and require answers that he can use "as it".Be polite, and learn to use a search engine, and I'll be kind.

 MaxCol06: hello
 Mr_BlueBird: hello!
 qrt: Hello&#160;:) Anyone know if there's a way to check what's failing the validators when you submit a solution? Doing the second temperature puzzle and I fail Validator 1 and Validator 12.
 struct: validator 12?
 struct: is it the golf one?
 qrt: I guess
 struct: The first validator for normal temperatures is 
 struct: 57 5 9 1 4
 struct: You can enable expert mode on settings
 struct: and paste custom testcases
 MiyamuraIzumi: feel lazy
 MiyamuraIzumi: what should I do?
 qrt: I can only see the test cases, not the validators.
 Uljahn: you need lvl 29+ to see them
 struct: MiyamuraIzumi do some multi
 Uljahn: and only for community puzzles
 struct: There are plenty of simple ones to get started with
 qrt: Aha
 struct: I can see that validator because it shows when I submit
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/8yGIbwx.png">https://i.imgur.com/8yGIbwx.png</a>
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh, we can see the validator of code golf
 Uljahn: ye, that's kinda hint
 MiyamuraIzumi: this is new to me
 qrt: When I submit it just says validator 1 = failed, validator 2-11 passed, validator 12 = failed
 struct: press details
 struct: ah on golf version it doesnt show
 struct: try the same code in the normal version
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures</a>
 qrt: Right :p It says to use as few chars as possible. That might be one of the two I'm failing.
 qrt: Normal one gets 100%
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/">https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/</a>this contest starts in a bit more than 3h
 struct: hmm it supports c++
 struct: I might give it a try, thanks euler
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i didn't even check the languages. no C#&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i could do Kotlin to practice for Kotlin Heroes next week
 eulerscheZahl: or i just go with Java
 struct: their link for discord doesnt seem to work for some reason
 geppoz: well quite brutal in registration, sex can only be M/F
 geppoz: though for this times
 eulerscheZahl: and chromium wants to auto-fill some fields. but doesn't really work. and when I then enter it manually, it suddenly appears twice
 eulerscheZahl: so my first name is RalphRalph now
 AllYourTrees: wow nice 1st place in C4 struct, how'd you do it?
 struct: I got pushed to first
 struct: check last battles 
 eulerscheZahl: bribery
 struct: I did not learn russian for nothing
 darkhorse64: waiting for MSmits to resubmit and get my 2nd place back
 struct: or you can ask robo
 struct: he will destroy me
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i did something wrong on kattis. how can i change my teamname?
 geppoz: darkhorse64 care man, coming my c++ porting :D
 struct: no idea euler
 struct: The contest is AI right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 darkhorse64: with 1.8M rollouts per second, I can bee a tough nut to crack
 darkhorse64: *be*
 geppoz: :D kidding
 struct: How many do you have now geppoz?
 darkhorse64: Not kidding, I am impressed with what you achieved with JS
 eulerscheZahl: :bee:
 struct: performance doesnt matter much
 geppoz: now I have 4000 sims at first turns
 eulerscheZahl: single steps or full rollouts?
 darkhorse64: it helps but I have other small tricks
 darkhorse64: full
 struct: 3 Mill full rollouts for me
 struct: per sec
 eulerscheZahl: i'm even below those 4k rollouts :D
 darkhorse64: It's even more insane
 struct: smart rollouts
 struct: The winner doesnt get a plane ticket?
 struct: only hotel?
 eulerscheZahl: good point
 eulerscheZahl: from the rules:COMPLETION OF REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONTEST.f
 eulerscheZahl: i like that random :F: at the end
 eulerscheZahl: :regional_indicator_f:
 eulerscheZahl: they pay respect
 struct: from the name it seems like a contest like gitc or something
 struct: planetoids
 struct: Maybe its a try angle catch clone
 struct: :D
 eulerscheZahl: or halite 2 or amadeus
 KP56: I found a massive COC bug
 eulerscheZahl: unleak the greek
 KP56: where do i report it
 KP56: i can ltierally abuse it so much
 eulerscheZahl: forum or discord
 KP56: ok
 eulerscheZahl: if you have some concerns that it should not be public: private message to Thibaud
 KP56: i think it can be public
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 eulerscheZahl: you can also let us know, maybe it's already known
 KP56: ok
 KP56: basically
 KP56: most shortest problems in COC require you to take a certain value and then loop that amount of times and take those inputs
 KP56: what you can do is ignore this value and change for i in range... to while 1:
 KP56: and this will still work as a proper solution
 struct: not a bug
 KiwiTae: its not a bug
 KP56: but it gives an error
 KP56: and still when i submit it
 KP56: i get 100%
 struct: it probably gives a warning
 eulerscheZahl: it's a common trick in golfing
 KP56: really?
 KiwiTae: yes
 KP56: i thought it is not meant to work
 eulerscheZahl: even some default codes like The Descent do it if i'm not mistaken
 breetanner: what are you guys talking about
 olaf_surgut: is there a game to practice simd?
 breetanner: do u guys recomend any games
 ANONYMOUS42: i heard codingame is good
 breetanner: do u guys recomend any games on here
 olaf_surgut: tron battle is nice
 breetanner: thanks
 breetanner: olaf_surgut  want to be freinds
 eulerscheZahl: i recommend TryAngle Catch
 eulerscheZahl: i'm totally not biased
 philRG: hehe
 kovi: do not try angle or give credit to euler. do dice duel instead
 geppoz: well literal porting from js to c++ only give me 2 positions, but I still have "char board[63];"... now let's see how bits can do...&#160;;)
 geppoz: *how much
 struct: im sure bitboards will help
 AllYourTrees: struct does your mcts solver include proven draws?
 struct: yes
 geppoz: uh nice, but they are rare, aren't they?
 struct: no idea
 geppoz: it should be only a little help
 struct: I can check
 AllYourTrees: i'm trying to figure out if i have a bug, mcts solver made no difference for me
 breetanner: anyone want to join me in a coding escape room
 Marchete: do you use pragmas, geppoz?
 geppoz: uhm not
 Marchete: then use them
 geppoz: not yet, at least
 Marchete: it's a two liner in c++
 breetanner: ok 
 Marchete: like 3x boost
 eulerscheZahl: even in CSB you can only BOOST once
 Marchete: you can boost every turn
 philRG: kovi :joy:
 struct: ok yes draws are rare
 struct: it seems
 Yakpimp: Is there a way to turn off the auto bracket completion?
 struct: I think on settings
 struct: on the left
 Illedan: :wave:
 AllYourTrees: for mcts solver you can only solve fully expanded nodes right?
 struct: hi Illedan
 Illedan: Yo, zup?
 struct: no AllYourTrees
 geppoz: no, as soon as you find a win, it is solved
 AllYourTrees: omg okay
 AllYourTrees: maybe thats why
 geppoz: then backprop and see if others higher are solved too
 AllYourTrees: but to prove a loss you need to have fully expanded?
 geppoz: yes
 eulerscheZahl: hi Illedan, will you join the contest?
 kovi: which contest?
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/">https://u.icpc.global/deviation-games/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: starts in 2h, lasts 3 days
 jacek: The overall winner will receive a Swag Bag
 jacek: hmmm
 struct: 260 registered
 jacek: bot game?
 struct: I think so
 eulerscheZahl: "an ICPC World Finals Experience (includes hotel room and meals)"but no travelling expenses mentioned, as struct pointed out
 Marchete: 14 pages of terms of service
 eulerscheZahl: TL;DR
 eulerscheZahl: i just hope there's nothing relevant in it
 struct: They fixed the F thing
 eulerscheZahl: F
 eulerscheZahl: they did not fix the discord invite
 struct: Just host in cg&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: struct, your task is to port the game to CG. so we get faster feedback of our bot performance
 struct: lol
 struct: Ill register after I see the game
 struct: Im not good in multi agent games
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not good at anything but C#&#160;:(
 struct: Well but you are very good at it
 eulerscheZahl: but there is no C# in this contest
 eulerscheZahl: and who needs Kotlin
 struct: I wanted to try breakthrough this weekend
 struct: hmm, Ill wait and see I guess
 jrke: any link to register
 jacek: breakthrough eh

 eulerscheZahl: 2020? weird URL
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand: European championship 2021...
 eulerscheZahl: i won't question it
 struct: hard to keep track of years
 BlaiseEbuth: Pas problems all seems to be about "Access denied"...
 BlaiseEbuth: *past
 eulerscheZahl: discord invite is broken too
 jacek: thats discord for ya
 BlaiseEbuth: In good ol' time we used to put urls in &lt;a&gt; tags and it worked. Now site force you to enable js to display and the links don't even work...&#160;:(
 struct: is minimax or mcts more popular in breakthrough?
 jacek: i think mcts. but i bet tric uses minimax
 struct: I also bet that dbd r uses minimax or some variation of it
 BlaiseEbuth: trictrac and dbdr?
 eulerscheZahl: we try not to ping them
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps BlaiseEbut h around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/63052365393434" /> jacek: eulerscheZahl why
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh sorry. Didn't know that was a secret conversation...&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: it's just that pings can be annoying depending on what you are doing at that moment
 BlaiseEbuth: Personally, if Idon't want to be pinged, I don't let the chat open.
 BlaiseEbuth: Sure that trictrac and dbdr do the same.
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway...
 eulerscheZahl: i'll remember to always ping you when i enter the website BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll wait your ping :heart_eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: About waiting... When NN will come back? This chat miss some "eulerscheZahl is there a way to..."&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i'm happy about our loss
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: i often thought about banning
 eulerscheZahl: not the problem solved itself
 BlaiseEbuth: Saved by a python update... What a joke
 eulerscheZahl: just don't tell magus about virtualenv
 simone.pelloni: Who is italian?
 eulerscheZahl: my favorite pizza baker
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't even know what it is, so don't worry eZ ^^'

 jacek: bitboards in JS?
 Marchete: he has c++ now
 jacek: :scream:
 struct: As long as I keep being pushed I dont mind :D
 struct: but im worried if all he did was add pragmas
 jacek: you gave it less time and still ended up high
 struct: yeah but even with less time i still had more rollouts than him
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl is there a way to anger you quicker than a ping?
 BlaiseEbuth: Pew pew!
 Zenoscave: pew pew 
 Astrobytes: reinstate aNN and get MK to DM him constantly about nothing

 Astrobytes: Might just be there's no info added yet, but it's a little odd
 struct: :zipper_mouth:
 Zenoscave: DAMMIT STRUCT HOW DO YOU ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING 
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that struct knows
 eulerscheZahl: we are just speculating. i bet it's escape
 BlaiseEbuth: You know nothing struct snow.
 eulerscheZahl: snow?
 struct: I bet its not
 eulerscheZahl: hm, maybe struct is testing again?
 struct: if its escape I delete 
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: but not that early. they invite testers late
 BlaiseEbuth: Was about to say that.
 eulerscheZahl: ICPC starts soon
 Astrobytes: Better not be an escape. That's no form for a contest.
 eulerscheZahl: just wait for it Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure it will happen. the only question is when
 struct: I would not stress about it
 struct: Im sure CG is aware that comunity doesnt want a escape contest
 BlaiseEbuth: You mean only 5% of the community?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://planetoids21.kattis.com/problems/deviation.planetoids">https://planetoids21.kattis.com/problems/deviation.planetoids</a>
 Astrobytes: Yes unfortunately I think the same euler
 struct: json input
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: i'll close chat to read rules
 BlaiseEbuth: No pictures, that suck. :unamused:
 Astrobytes: easy enough to extract struct
 struct: csb on steroids
 BlaiseEbuth: *asteroids
 eulerscheZahl: after reading it, i think i have a free weekend
 struct: if plane ticket was included I would have tried
 eulerscheZahl: i expected a multiplayer from their announcement&#160;:(
 struct: same
 struct: i did not expect optimization
 Astrobytes: Too short notice for me. Just upgraded to windows 10 and gonna be converting an old PC salvaged from my grandads to linux
 eulerscheZahl: why didn't you just wait for win11?
 eulerscheZahl: to then not install it
 BlaiseEbuth: But... But! ... They said win10 was the last!
 struct: still maybe I can try a simple MC or BS
 struct: to see how it performs
 eulerscheZahl: but you can't trust MS BlaiseEbuth
 eulerscheZahl: atcoder has a heuristic contest starting soon (in 9h). lasts 6 days
 BlaiseEbuth: I know... But I was optimist on this one
 Astrobytes: lol. I figured since Win 11 came out I should finally do 10
 eulerscheZahl: what did you have before?
 BlaiseEbuth: 2000
 Astrobytes: 8.1, for compatibility reasons that I don't have to worry about currently
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/minesweeper-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/minesweeper-1</a>that background was actually to courtesy of Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: 8.1 wasn't like that
 BlaiseEbuth: worst...
 struct: worse than vista
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Astrobytes: I used classic shell, so it acted the same as old windows
 BlaiseEbuth: Tiles! Tiles everywhere!
 Astrobytes: I never got on with all that weird tiling app shit
 Astrobytes: Fine on mobile devices but not on my bloody desktop
 jacek: hmm is there hexagonal minesweeper
 AllYourTrees: that sounds fun
 jacek: everything is better with hexes
 AllYourTrees: can we combine photosynthesis with minesweeper
 BlaiseEbuth: Hexagonal 3d minesweeper on a tore in a non-euclidean referential
 jacek: non-eulerian
 jacek: why so low in bt
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder had a minesweeper optim contest recently
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't get the mine count for direct neighbors only but within a certain radius
 eulerscheZahl: which varied between testcases
 PeakDeveloper: im stuck on temperatures
 PeakDeveloper: got a long way to go
 Astrobytes: Didn't see that in 'external contests' on discord euler :P
 eulerscheZahl: because i don't share contests that happen on a regular schedule
 eulerscheZahl: like topcoder is once per month, I rarely share them
 Astrobytes: ah, fair enough
 eulerscheZahl: i do when they have nice illustrations. easier to get someone interested than with a wall of text
 Astrobytes: also a good point &lt;insert CG comment here&gt;
 Astrobytes: thanks for the reminder about BT jacek (even though you were talking to AllYourTrees I think). Just fixed a bug.
 AllYourTrees: BT?
 AllYourTrees: what was the bug?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Breakthrough
 AllYourTrees: oooh
 BlaiseEbuth: o//
 Astrobytes: A movegen thing, it was returning invalid moves now and then. Couldn't see the wood for the trees, the break did me some good at least
 struct: I need to figure how to generate moves efficiently 
 Astrobytes: I was gonna say 'start simple' but then it's you struct :D
 struct: :D
 struct: It was my first function on c4
 struct: and then it was rollout
 BlaiseEbuth: Are you sure that's him?&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Unless he's been possessed recently, yes.
 BlaiseEbuth: About this...
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: o.o
 jacek: oO
 jacek: so, how much in rank did you advance
 Astrobytes: well, that was an improvement. 70-something to 35 with that one  tiny bugfix. Need to fix the rest of the stuff I changed because of it but that can wait.
 jacek: oh my
 WingsBreaker: printf("hello cunts\n");
 AllYourTrees: oh my
 BlaiseEbuth: First! \o/
 Astrobytes: eyyy
 eulerscheZahl: cruel Blaise shows no mercy
 eulerscheZahl: but I won't miss that user
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks :hugging
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: BlaiseZeBrute
 Astrobytes: My first full day back here the other day I was assaulted by schoolkids for about an hour in the afternoon. Was really fun...
 Astrobytes: Bans went to spamming my DMs
 BlaiseEbuth: A french singer said "Les enfants ça sert à rien, faut les brûler".
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 Astrobytes: :D
 wlesavo: BlaiseEbuth i even checked your acc to see in which game you are first, and only then realised it was about ban :slight_smile:
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Private game between mods
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zTQkW4Pf9A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zTQkW4Pf9A</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the one that i'm always losing
 wlesavo: btw finaly figured out how to delete second slash to order my raic prizes :smiley:
 Astrobytes: you should've been winning whilst I was absent euler
 eulerscheZahl: often I type /kick &lt;user&gt;. then it takes a few seconds and there appears a message that someone else was faster
 eulerscheZahl: i was absent too
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: :rofl: 
 Astrobytes: "burn them like they do in Brazil"?
 Astrobytes: Insanity
 BlaiseEbuth: :no_mouth:
 struct: chat also seems laggy
 jacek: ban takes much processing power
 Astrobytes: Don't think it's laggy, just quiet
 jacek: with all this banning...
 struct: yeah, yesterday I banned 3 in &lt; 10 seconds
 eulerscheZahl: that's more than i banned in total
 Astrobytes: Was the day before for me iirc, or yesterday. Not sure any more lol
 Astrobytes: Hm. We are missing a killcount tracker
 Marchete: muuultikill
 Astrobytes: InstaGib!
 Astrobytes: Improvements eh AllYourTrees
 AllYourTrees: :wave:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AllYourTrees: :D
 jacek: eh eh?
 Benjabbj: hi?
 struct: for puzzles I think is level 20
 struct: and for clashes is like 50 clashes  I think
 DavidDeLord: i did 50 cocs and a still cant approve
 struct: maybe its a wip clash?
 DavidDeLord: then the approved/rejected buttons wont appear right?
 struct: yes
 ANONYMOUS42: or maybe it takes time to give you the rights since you have exactly 50 clashes
 DavidDeLord: yeah thats what im thinking
 DavidDeLord: lemme do one more
 AllYourTrees: do people have smart rollouts in breakthrough?
 BlaiseEbuth: Autobots
 AllYourTrees:&#160;?
 struct: I would say yes AllYourTrees
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/t/autobots_roll_out/Gxz2Pbz">https://imgur.com/t/autobots_roll_out/Gxz2Pbz</a>
 AllYourTrees: lol BlaiseEbuth
 AllYourTrees: struct any tips?
 struct: i havent started yet
 struct: i have no idea how to do an efficient move generator for it
 AllYourTrees: what do you count as efficient?&#160;:)
 struct: Hard to say for now
 struct: Its not that simple to generate moves
 struct: on c4 is way simpler
 AllYourTrees: ya i had to do some weird stuff in breakthrough
 Kalenn: For fellow C# people, how do you add a space between each character of a string? Using String.Join didn't  work. String example&#160;: "12345" and I would want to print it as "1 2 3 4 5"
 Husoski: Does C# have a toCharArray() string method? That's what you'd use in Java to get an iterable of the characters in a string.
 Kalenn: yes, there is. 
 Husoski: Try feeding that to join() then...
 Husoski: (may not work if join won't treat a char as a string)
 Husoski: (haven't done C# in 10 years, so my skills are not only rusty, but *old*.)
 Husoski: Yep. it works:
 Husoski: Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", "hello".ToCharArray()));
 Kalenn: Nice. Thank you for your help. I got busy with something else. I will try it out too.
 NA08: Hey siri
 NA08: Anyone use Codeforces

 Ajaiy: jacek: Did you use the CodinGame featured puzzle to get the "Babylon tower" Achievement?
 Angelovski: what kind alien language is clojure
 jacek: Ajaiy i used some puzzle that always passes and used different langs
 Ajaiy: Like?
 Ajaiy: All puzzles always pass if the correct answer is given
 Ajaiy: So you used a random puzzle?
 Ayza: I just used onboarding
 Ajaiy: lol
 Ajaiy: So basically you can "cheat" to get Babylon Tower
 Ayza: learn how to print and use if statements in each language, 0 guilt
 Ayza: but I didn't :slight_smile:
 Ajaiy: Doing it via the CodinGame featured puzzle is even easier
 Ajaiy: you just replace the printing string by *SPOILER*

 Sephirious: Hello everyone, I have a question with There is no Spoon - Episode 1 game
 Sephirious: In example given, shouldn't that 1,0 and 0,1 needs to have 1 neighbor&#160;?
 Sephirious: Game says they don't have a neughbor but they are connected with 0,0
 5DN1L: The statement says:
 5DN1L: To do this, you must find each (x1,y1) coordinates containing a node, and display the (x2,y2) coordinates of the next node to the right, and the (x3,y3) coordinates of the next node to the bottom within the grid.
 5DN1L: so only check the right neighbour and the bottom neighbour
 Sephirious: Oh missed it, thank you so much&#160;:)
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 BryanFRD: Hi, I was wondering why the expected output on the conway-sequence is "3 1 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 3 2 2 1 1 25" for the 4th test
 5DN1L: What do you think should be the answer?
 BryanFRD: 3 1 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 3 2 2 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 3 2 2 1 1 5
 5DN1L: where's 25 gone?
 BryanFRD: Why would it write 25
 5DN1L: because the starting number is 25
 5DN1L: 2nd line becomes "1 25"
 5DN1L: 3rd line becomes "1 1 1 25"
 5DN1L: and so on

 JystoDussPipouPrime: ok thanks
 therealbeef: initialization is (for some reason) one of the trickiest things in c++
 therealbeef: really a weakness in the language i think
 Prince6502: is int x; is the same thing as int x=0;&#160;? (c++):
 struct: no
 Prince6502: Here int x is NULL but x = 0 is 0
 struct: i dont think its NULL
 jacek: its some random value from memory
 jacek: it may depend on compiler options and/or system
 Tien118: why autocomplete doesn't work if i type a letter&#160;:(

 TechTheAwesome: any rustaceans here? :P
 jacek: :scream:
 AstaWisdom: hello
 TechTheAwesome: just a dumb question... but how'd you go about parsing multiple input lines into an Vec&lt;&gt; array to work with? Since "".split("") only return &amp;str reference and they get dropped inside the for loop
 Uljahn: just undrop them [solved]
 TechTheAwesome: :joy:
 Uljahn: can't you declare a vec outside the loop and assign its elements inside the loop?
 Fasty_V-12_Engine: Hi
 TechTheAwesome: well since split("") returns &amp;str if i declare vec outside, then vec.push(&amp;str) its only contains the ref, and will be dropped because string is inside loop. The borrow-check rule. 
 TechTheAwesome: I can get around this by declaring String::new() 
 TechTheAwesome: but then that'd mean pushing the entire input into heap, then parse it later on when input loop ends
 Alan_Greyrock: What program. language is that?
 TechTheAwesome: Rust
 Alan_Greyrock: Oh okay
 TechTheAwesome: its a good rule for memory safety. But can limit some solutions at times. 
 jacek: so rust programs never get dementia

 GNye22: Anyone know why Pair cannot be resolved to a type for Java? Does the IDE not support Java 9?
 jacek: have you tried import
 GNye22: Yeah, it's javafx.util.Paths and it says javafx cannot be resolved

 GNye22: I wasn't even aware until now that it was part of the JavaFX library, I figured it was part of the standard util library with ArrayList and such
 jacek: the more you know
 GNye22: Ok, bummer, guess I'll just have to insert nodes into the graph object rather than populate it with a Pair array on construction
 jacek: or create your own pair ~
 GNye22: True, but not worth the work for what I'm trying to accomplish.
 GNye22: Just easier to ditch it and add a separate method for adding graph paths

 Wontonimo: have you tried getting brutaltester to work with 2 dummy scripts that just output wait&#160;?
 Wontonimo: to figure out if it is your code of the ref?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: j4at I have little experience with this, but my cli has it's own runtime parameters ... memory, time limits, etc.  I often have to set memory limits much higher, so depending on your setup you might have to look at cli default constants.  I dunno tho.  I think brutaltester just passes what it knows back to you.  I mean, your cli could be terminating the exec and brutal assumes it's an out of time thing
 struct: cg sdk is limited to 30seconds
 struct: per game
 j4at: There is nothing wrong with my script i tested with dummy script that prints only "WAIT" every x time (total +30sec)
 struct: with wait you get this error?

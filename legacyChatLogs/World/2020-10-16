 SINGHALBROTHER: HELP ME C#
 MadKnight: what is that link for
 pluieciel: Hi!
 pluieciel: one question: clojure macro doesn't work here in IDE, right?
 JBM: why eouldn't it?
 pluieciel: (defmacro prefix [exp]
 pluieciel: (println (macroexpand '(prefix (5 * x))))
 pluieciel: Standard Output Stream:(prefix (5 * x))
 pluieciel: in my computer:
 pluieciel: my-test.core&gt; (println (macroexpand '(prefix (5 * x))))(* 5 x)
 Shrimpster: Some random Asian kid just followed me, should I worry? :rolling_eyes: (he's my first follower haha)
 magaiti: he liked your name, no doubt
 Shrimpster: hahaha thanx, that's probably it
 Astrobytes: if you don't know him, simply don't follow back Shrimpster
 Shrimpster: I would never, he just followed and I thought it was weird (^.^)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it happens fairly frequently unfortunately
 Shrimpster: ok good to know
 Remembered_Goodbye: hey guys, how do you do the ascii art puzzle
 Remembered_Goodbye: nah screw it ill search it online cause dead chat
 Kamatcho: Damn, trying out python for the first time
 Astrobytes: Nice to see you waited less than a minute before making that decision.
 Kamatcho: It's quite hard.. feeling dumb here xD
 Astrobytes: If you're totally new to python (and programming) codingame *might* not be the best for practising Kamatcho
 Astrobytes: It assumes a basic working knowledge
 Kamatcho: Which I don't posess
 Kamatcho: What might be better? I've done some lua programming earlier 
 Astrobytes: Hm, you could try freecodecamp? I think that's supposed to be decent for learning
 Astrobytes: Or there's always youtube video series and what not, depends how you prefer to learn
 Kamatcho: Mostly by doing
 Kamatcho: And then again mostly by trying to solve things
 Astrobytes: freecodecamp should work then I reckon
 Astrobytes: Then, when you're a bit more comfortable you can come back here and solve some puzzles etc
 Kamatcho: Might check that out before I go in here doing puzzles and feeling stupid lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's advisable. So you can focus on just solving the problem rather than trying to figure out the language&#160;:)
 Kamatcho: Thanks for the advice!
 Astrobytes: No problem at all
 Sylarb91: Astrobytes... does freecodecamp have something for c# too, cuz i just looked and couldnt find anything&#160;?
 Sylarb91: i know the basics of c#... but there is always room for improvement
 Astrobytes: Sylarb91: No I don't think so, it covers JS, python, HTML &amp; CSS, some other web-stuff only I believe
 Astrobytes: Not sure where's best for C# tbh
 Ramdeath: hi all
 Sylarb91: ok. thank you
 Astrobytes: hi Ramdeath
 geppoz: hi
 geppoz: there is a way to collect all the scores of the tests?
 geppoz: without looking each one, but getting as a table?
 magaiti: you can make a js script for that
 magaiti: i dont have one ready available
 magaiti: but it should be as easy as 3 lines
 MadKnight: geppoz u can run custom js scripts on web pages
 geppoz: after i play all testcases i find result in some variable?
 geppoz: or you mean launching test with my js?
 GaethofsQ: Is there any more documentation on coders strike back? I'm looking for the formulas used to define the speed, acceleration, etc... of the drones
 KiwiTae: check the forums
 Uljahn: or CSB landing page, there are some links to external resources
 735487: geppoz: I have one. it show all test case results and sum it up
 735487: var sum=0;var i=1;$('.testcase').each(function() {
 735487: I used it for 2048 game. that is why it skips first test result
 ooh: is there a way to erase submissions in history?
 magaiti: why would you want to do so?
 Unkmar: Are you ashamed of your progress?
 ooh: i have duplicates, a lot
 magaiti: progress is a process of trial and error, and there are shameful errors
 ooh: i'm ashamed of pressing submit on the same code
 Shrimpster: there's no shame in that, happens to everyone
 magaiti: yeah, i for once, want color tags for my submissions, and maybe even editable descriptions
 boubagaa: help me
 boubagaa: pleaaaase
 Astrobytes: magaiti:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Azkellas/cgenhancer">https://github.com/Azkellas/cgenhancer</a>
 magaiti: hmm, intersting stuff. but no
 Astrobytes: It has editable descriptions
 magaiti: ok ill look into it someday. thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 wlesavo: it would be quite good if enhancer wouldnt reset all the descriptions from time to time
 Astrobytes: agreed
 eulerscheZahl: does it still break the UI for puzzles?
 Azkellas: Never heard of this issue wlesavo
 MSmits: mmh for some reason c++ doesn't like it if i set a 100 million sized uint8_t array to the value 3
 MSmits: I'll just set it to 0 before run time and change it to 3 during runtime when needed
 MSmits: works.... dunno why
 Alshock: xD That's a bit weird
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I think it's some kind of optimization
 Alshock: you have an initialization list of 100 million {3}&#160;?
 MSmits: you cant do that I think
 skrutt: nope
 MSmits: if you set it to 3 that way its just the first element
 MSmits: the rest will be 0
 MSmits: i was using a function to set them all to 3 at the start of the program
 MSmits: but i think the compiler noticed it and decided to do this before runtime
 Alshock: Ik, that's why I was asking if you had an initialization list with 100 million threes, wouldn't actually write them all down ;P
 MSmits: which took too long somehow..
 MSmits: oh lol, no.
 MSmits: awww the first symbol of my endgame book is a ✻
 MSmits: damnit, i finally finish my size 12 endgame book for Bandas and I crash my VS because the string is too big
 YurkovAS: MSmits do you know the original name of the game Bandas?
 MSmits: nope
 jacek: bandas isnt original? D:
 Dan4Life: \o/

 jacek: wtf? how can i reply to a forum post
 asuna321: i kinda suck at this 
 eulerscheZahl: use the "reply" button
 jacek: i clicked reply, typed text but i cant see any send or ok button
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot?
 eulerscheZahl: is there a bar at the top?
 eulerscheZahl: if yes, close it
 jrke: oh trailer out for fall challenge thats nice
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/tjaYopF.png">https://i.imgur.com/tjaYopF.png</a>
 jacek: ahh, thx euler
 eulerscheZahl: and close that windows bar as you are on it
 jrke: yeah euler is right
 jacek: windows bar?
 jacek: i only use windows for games, so i dont bother customizing browser much
 jrke: euler have you registered now,i mean you were having problem in registration of fall challenge is it fixed?
 eulerscheZahl: was fixed minutes later
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they broke it again, no idea
 jrke: oh thats to quick
 eulerscheZahl: 9,194 registered
 eulerscheZahl: let's check again in a few minutes
 jrke: yes will cross 15,000 this time i think
 eulerscheZahl: 2 more registered now. seems to be working
 jrke: yeah 
 jrke: i am off now gn bye bye&#160;:)
 Neumann: eulerscheZahl: is it me or does 2048 have the same issue as SearchRace regarding timeouts when you use more than 40ms&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even check the time i take per turn, don't know
 MadKnight: Neumann people on #ru were saying they also had the same problem in both
 Neumann: Ok&#160;:/
 MadKnight: amurushkin
 eulerscheZahl: that's disappointing&#160;:(
 Apocrypha_blank_01: Question.  Does your clash rank update even if you play privately with friends&#160;?
 jacek: ahh so thats why im not #1 at 2048 :v
 MadKnight: Neumann could it be related to some kind of late timer stopper in the SDK&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: Apocrypha_blank_01: no
 Neumann: Now I need to figure out why my BeamSearch sucks
 Neumann: MadKnight: maybe, hard to tell without any backend information
 MadKnight: like it takes 15ms to read all moves that u print + proceed them
 MadKnight: try splitting your entire solution in 600 turns
 Neumann: Meh, I don't think so. Even with a really under-optimised engine, processing a hundred instructions shouldn't take that long
 petr_step: Hi
 MadKnight: yea but reading from stdin might be slow
 Neumann: It's all on one line
 MadKnight: maybe just try splitting in 600 lines&#160;?
 MSmits: man... VS goes mental, it's only 24209 characters
 MSmits: one one line I mean
 jacek: why dont you do it normally in VS and the unicode stuff only in the ide
 MSmits: cuz you hadn't suggested it to me yet
 jacek: its obvious
 MSmits: also, how do i play CG bench matches this way? I tried putting in these unicode strings, but it doesnt take them
 MSmits: something to do with encoding of the text file
 jacek: i dont use cg bench
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: oh btw, what i did so far, was use a different program to produce the string, output it to console and then copy paste it into the other program. For some reason this inserts random spaces
 MSmits: only very few, but still
 Schwase: anyone here do "the lucky number" puzzle before?
 Schwase: its the one with 6s and 8s
 jacek: i use python to do te encoding
 MSmits: mmh ok
 jacek: how big endgame can you solve in reasonable time?
 jacek: if not for the 100k limit
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: I think using an endgame db, I can solve full maps
 petr_step: What is your favourite language?
 MSmits: with 3x3 as the biggest, I already solve at ply 9-15
 MSmits: if I make a bigger db offline and run the algo on the full map, i can solve it in a few mins to hrs probably
 MSmits: depending on the map
 MSmits: I do this with mcts so it's not the most efficient solver
 MSmits: probably could be done faster with a proper negamax
 MSmits: but the database I hope to get working I should be able to have endgames of 2x6 or 4x3 instantly solved also. It's just a really big jump. From roughly 30k states to nearly 2 million
 MSmits: it fits easily in 24k unicode characters, but having some problems debugging
 jacek: 24k unicode? thats just 48k normal
 MSmits: i could use ascii encoding sure, but thats not really easy either
 MSmits: you cant use the full 8 bit, it's 7 bit
 MSmits: and i dont really get the extended ascii or understand whether i can use it here
 MSmits: might be i can also fit it with base64 even
 MSmits: but then the string gets long also, 
 jacek: mmh ok
 MSmits: I'm thinking the unicode range has some more gaps that I am running up against 
 MSmits: I know there's a 2k gap in the high ranges that I am skipping
 Nerchio: hey guys is there any UTTT local referee for all levels i think i could find only for 1 board
 Nerchio: or i don't know how to change it to higher level :D
 YurkovAS: Nerchio readme has uttt referee <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 YurkovAS: run command:java -jar ./cg-brutaltester.jar -r "java -jar -Dleague.level=2 tictactoe-referee.jar" -p1 "./uttt-1" -p2 "./uttt-2" -t 10 -n 1000 -l "./logs/"
 Nerchio: it says my player does invalid input when it clearly doesn't :P
 Nerchio: my player can play boss in the uttt referee but when i try to play myself it doesnt work idk
 Nerchio: ah i guess it had a problem with reading the same file so i created a copy xd
 Nerchio: nvm it doesn't really work when i play against myself doesnt make any sense ;p i guess i will just leave it
 tobk: So, from now on all challenges will be called "[Season] Challenge [Year]"? Kind of dull...
 Astrobytes: they switched to 2 official contests per year so I guess that's the way they want it :neutral_face:
 tobk: I don't have a problem with the two contests thing, and even using that name for the contest, I'd just wish they would re-brand it when it's released for MP
 Astrobytes: valid point
 Majeck: Wait, so no more awesome names like "Coders Strike Back", "A Code of Ice and Fire", "XMAS RUSH", "Code a la Mode", etc? 
 Majeck: Not kidding, the names were one of my favorite parts hahaha
 Astrobytes: Sure seems that way yeah
 Majeck:&#160;:/
 Majeck: Woah Google is registered for the fall contest cool!
 Majeck: Amazon too
 MSmits: all it requires is some players that work there
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: doesn't mean jeff bezos made a decision&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 Majeck: Oh you're right hahaha I thought it was a company decision lol
 jacek: meh imagine deepmind playing contest
 MSmits: it would get claustrophobic and we'd beat it

 Dan4Life: negation doesnt work ~
 MSmits: it's the way the chat shows the tilde
 Astrobytes: it's a font issue don't worry
 MSmits: it doesn't do squiggly
 MSmits: You know what's annoying. The community games usually dont have swap, but some games are really lopsided in favor of p1 
 MSmits: Bandas is 70-30 when I test it. Then I submit and i get 7 games vs karliso of which he is player 1 6 times
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and no way to change it as the creator
 MSmits: time for some spam&#160;!
 MSmits: I finally have my huge engame book working
 Astrobytes: for Bandas?
 MSmits: am in ballpark with Nagrarok and karliso now
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it has almost 2 million endgame states with L/W/D values
 jacek: and loops are D?
 Astrobytes: didn't know you were making one lol, I should just assume you always have/are working on an endgame db for any game you're currently playing
 MSmits: apparently there are no loops that are affected by the turn limit unless the turn is beyond 190 or so
 MSmits: so that means i can just look them up, loops arent always draw
 MSmits: depends on how many dudes there are
 MSmits: of p1 and p2
 MSmits: what i did was retrograde analaysis for every state, from turn 200, backwards. Then I tested if any state has a different value for any turn between 1 and 190 and they did not
 MSmits: but a state at turn 195 or so may have a diffeent value than it has at turn 190, so you cant look up the states at the very end
 MSmits: this is very different in oware btw. You have to always take the turn into account
 LuaCultist: lol
 MSmits: (to solve I mean, obviously not to win in most cases)
 MSmits: earlier I accidentally forgot to reset my time at the beginning of my turn, which meant I only used calculation time in the first turn. The rest of the game it would do at most 1 expansion and then stop. I still got rank 11, mostly because it used the reused tree from turn 1 :P
 MSmits: was kinda hard to figure out though,  I thought I messed up my unicode stuff again
 MSmits: jacek, as for your loop question. This game was solved at frame 29:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493501704">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493501704</a>
 Astrobytes: I usually forget to start the timer and wonder why it times out
 MSmits: it shows as value 0 solved
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: this one is way more extreme: I solved it as a loss at frame 14. It turns into  a loop with tric trac having 2 more dudes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493501556">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493501556</a>

 MSmits: yw :P
 MSmits: was solved at frame 12
 MSmits: this is why dudecount is a bad evaluator for this game, you had way more guys, but they were nearer the edge
 PatrickMcGinnisII: umm, i only looked at my 4 moves... nothing deeper...so....lol
 MSmits: yeah I know, this game heavily favors performance too
 MSmits: like uttt
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I still in top half of leaderboard, so more than half aren't even trying
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so, you're saying goal to make game last longer may be more beneficial?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or end in your favor i guess
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: in my case it doesn't matter, is solve very early. Basically, either the game is lopsided (many maps are) or you just make the right decisions the first few turns
 MSmits: I lose to lower ranked players sometimes, mostly because of the maps
 MSmits: the mcts node value will be -0.4 or something, which is really bad and that shows that no matter what you do, your position is crap
 Metanoob: when your algo thinks its right but it's actually having a seizure:  "Found: abdarbdacaaadadabdarb...Expected: abracadabra"
 MSmits: lol
 Metanoob: a bit like Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i just don't know what i'm doing
 Metanoob: sry mate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, not over my head.  But I'm always in the situation of determining the overhead execution cost of iterative deepening/pruning or just dropping a heuristic rule.  Bandas is one of those like you said like uttt, where sure you can gen 20k nodes, but if you try to prune and go deeper you lose 25% of the total nodes you can explore
 MSmits: true
 Metanoob: in those kind of challenges, timeout counts a lot, right? Does that mean some languages have the upperhand slightly?
 MSmits: depending on which languages you compare, it might be a lot
 MSmits: C# and java, small difference, C# and C++ large difference, C++ and python HUGE difference
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I put an opening book together for UTTT, and it helped alot.  I didn't properly mcts after that ... and left a basic heuristic in place because I didn't have the time to fix the MC.
 MSmits: yeah that would certainly help, if the book is good
 Dan4Life: quick question, why is shortest mode a mode in clash of code considering its very inconvenient for C++, C# and Java Users?
 MSmits: easiest is to just watch top players and copy their moves
 MSmits: use the right tool for the job Dan4Life
 MSmits: it's not a goal of CG to make all languages equivalent
 Dan4Life: So i should learn Ruby then?
 MSmits: python should really be enough
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't run the sim for long enough locally to really refine the book, and I couldn't get more than 50k board states
 Dan4Life: oh, ok
 MSmits: 50k moves in the book?
 Astrobytes: feel free to learn Ruby if you want ofc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think I ran it for 2 days.  I'd have to look it over, but 50k was the goal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: boardstate X, best move =.
 Metanoob: makes sense yeah MSmits, thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats pretty awesome PatrickMcGinnisII, it's not that easy to fit this many moves in the codesizes
 Astrobytes: don't forget Rust in that speed comparison
 Metanoob: oof yeah
 MSmits: I am guessing you stored a tree PatrickMcGinnisII, as opposed to fully defined states?
 MSmits: that way you only need to store each move
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b94ce08-42c2-46c2-b241-1d1bdc888b4f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b94ce08-42c2-46c2-b241-1d1bdc888b4f</a>

 PatrickMcGinnisII: pastbin.pl wouldn't load

 MSmits: pastebin.pl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: A Database Error Occurred

 Metanoob: yup, perl confirmed
 Astrobytes: Steganography challenge!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's compressed, but it is what it is
 rohanjain: do we also get difficult questions in clash of codes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Difficulty is subjective rohanjain
 Metanoob: ^
 Astrobytes: If you feel they're too easy try some puzzles instead
 rohanjain: so as we increase in level, the difficulty increases&#160;?
 Allis: No, that wouldn't make sense for Clash.
 Allis: You don't get to choose your opponents.
 Astrobytes: No, I mean it's a personal experience. You may find it easy, others may find it hard.
 rohanjain: oh ok
 Metanoob: also PatrickMcGinnisII I've had to do that so many times too, most frequently with exporting encoded images to data:base64 in js because of canvas tainting
 Metanoob: s/encoded//
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if size isn't an issue md5 works
 rohanjain: if after coming after first in clash of codes, if we leave in between, would the progress still show or it won't&#160;?
 Astrobytes: rohanjain: puzzle section is here, varying difficulty levels<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>

 Astrobytes: rohanjain: there's a channel for clash links - #clash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits I think your terniary works better than what i did
 rohanjain: oh i didn't knew
 Astrobytes: You can ask in here but keep links to private msg or #clash
 Astrobytes: It's OK don't worry
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII when i write an opening book i never store gamestates
 Astrobytes: plies + best moves no?
 MSmits: I store a tree made of moves. In the first turn, my bot turns that tree into a map with states
 MSmits: it looks like this:
 Astrobytes: aha gotcha
 MSmits: 4 { 3 5 { 6 } }
 MSmits: i play 4, best response is 3, if opponent plays 5, i play 6
 Astrobytes: elegant
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just was running into issues with addressing the correct branch/node
 MSmits: btw, i never bothered compressing an opening book
 MSmits: a single move requires so much calculation time that i never hit the limit
 MSmits: my oware book looks like the example i just shared, including the spaces and such. It's still only a few kb
 MSmits: despite a run time of months
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so 2 bits per position x 81 + 5 bits for the move... umm compresses into ... crap I forgot
 Astrobytes: small pecan brownies
 Astrobytes: :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea gotta be crack brownies at this point
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: for example, if you do oware, you basically need values between 0 and 5 for the move and each move needs information for the follow up (sibling, go deeper, or go up)
 MSmits: so 18 possibilities
 MSmits: means you can fit 3 moves in a single unicode character
 MSmits: so I am guessing 200-300k moves is realistic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits but don't you end up with alot of empty spots in the data?
 MSmits: why empty
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cause the game would be over
 MSmits: how so?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess it's how you are referrencing them
 MSmits: oh usually unordered map 
 MSmits: this doesnt have to be fast
 MSmits: i just do one lookup per turn anyway
 Einwickler: MSmits you there?
 MSmits: the conversion from text-tree to unorderedmap takes some time but its ok
 MSmits: didn't you see me spamming Einwickler?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: langs get caught up trying to find the right index in an array if it doesn't have a mathematical or incremental 'method'
 Astrobytes: He's not Einwickler, it's an imposter, don't believe the hype
 MSmits: it's not an array PatrickMcGinnisII
 Einwickler: yeah I just noticed my chat was scrolled up :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: unordered map is a hash table
 MSmits: well i am giving up spamming, karliso's bandas bot still beats mine
 MSmits: i'll be happy 2nd
 Einwickler: Didnt want to interrupt you guys. sorry for that :stuck_out_tongue:
 MSmits: np
 Astrobytes: I just noticed the time, I'm off. gn all&#160;:) 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahhh, cg doesn't support SplHash for php
 MSmits: what did you want to ask Einwickler	?
 Einwickler: cu astro
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and everytime php makes an object the memory overhead is just stupid
 MSmits: yeah, some languages are like that =/
 Einwickler: I just implemented basic minimax for uttt and was remembering your advice of not going into the arena
 MSmits: ah right
 MSmits: does it always win in wood?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so your bandas finally finished computing
 MSmits: cuz it should if you did it right
 Einwickler: Im pretty sure its working as intended now. Anything I should test before going to next league with 9x9?
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII i submitted many times, a few times 2nd, sometimes lower, but never 1st
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pretty darn close, gratz
 Einwickler: Against the wood boss at least, yes&#160;:)
 MSmits: Einwickler you can try to add ab pruning. It's not particularly hard to implement. Takes a while to wrap your head around why it works though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i looked awhile back you were hovering around 7
 MSmits: ah yeah,  that was before the end game book
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so, what did karliso do I wonder
 MSmits: i always wonder that. In uttt he has a 3k line bot and I have no idea what to write about uttt in that many lines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unrolling some loops can gain a few ms...maybe i guess
 MSmits: usually the compiler does that and it barely matters
 MSmits: definitely not why his bot is better
 MSmits: probably he has some smart heuristics
 Hjax: did you guys see that Rémi Coulom (author of crazy stone) took #1 on Dots and Boxes O_O
 JBM: classy
 The_Auditor: what? RickRoll&#160;?

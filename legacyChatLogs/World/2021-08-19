 xxd: the dopamine has worn off, back to work ._.
 Wontonimo: well, i'm sure if you fix the replacement your bot will jump in rank
 Wontonimo: what are you using? 128bit, 64bit, something else?
 xxd: 64bit
 xxd: using masks for win detection
 xxd: which i miraculously figured out myself without asking others for it
 xxd: (therefore may also be buggy)
 Wontonimo: if you are 41th, and it not even handling replacement, then it's doing a lot right
 xxd: i'm gonna drop when it stabilizes
 xxd: (dropping back down as we speak)
 xxd:&#160;:(
 Blokops: second to last coding speed quest is impossible&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: really?
 Blokops: been here for hours now
 xxd: which one?
 xxd: the 3 in a row?
 Wontonimo: take a break
 Blokops: yes
 xxd: do it when you're fresh
 Wontonimo: wait till only noobs are online
 Blokops: question
 Blokops: wahts the last quest
 Wontonimo: and, start the clash with as few people as possible
 Blokops: wontonimo it doesn't feel fair
 Wontonimo: that's it, 3 in a row
 Blokops: wut
 Blokops: so is that and im done?
 Wontonimo: yup
 Blokops: :I
 Blokops: aigh final stretch then 
 Wontonimo: take a break, do connect 4 with us
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4</a>
 xxd: why is it not fair Blokops?
 xxd: with practice, the CoC path is trivial
 xxd: its by far the easiest of all of them
 Blokops: i want the challange of beating multiple people no just bots
 xxd: what language do you use?
 Blokops: python
 xxd: good chance at winning shortests
 xxd: assuming no ruby/perl users
 Wontonimo: i had trouble with 3 in a row
 Blokops: yup still cant beat those ruby,javascriupt freaks thaty scare me
 xxd: i did competitive programming for ~2 years so speed coding is second nature for me
 xxd: just leave the clash if theres a rubyist
 xxd: theres not that many and you can tell if you play enough
 xxd: javascript is not great
 Wontonimo: really?  where did you do competitive coding?
 xxd: Codeforces, and also just general algorithmic prep by studying for USACO competition
 Wontonimo: anything in person (prior to covid)?
 xxd: yeah, i went to Stanford ProCo in freshman year
 xxd: in the novice division
 xxd: since i had only been coding for &lt;1 year at the time
 xxd: and got 4th place with my team
 xxd: but we woulda gotten first, had we not choked on the last problem
 xxd: oh, proco is only for high schoolers btw
 Wontonimo: that's really cool!
 Wontonimo: I went to 1 coding competition in jr high.  The challenge was to center justify text by adding spaces.  looking back it was really novice by todays standards, but at the time it seemed very challenging
 xxd: well things have to be put into the context of the time period
 xxd: im sure it was challenging
 xxd: but darn, just thinking about how that is literally a standard library function (in python at least) today...
 xxd: wait
 xxd: justify
 xxd: completely misread
 xxd: also fun fact, the first program i wrote that i was proud of was a text justification program
 Wontonimo: nice
 xxd: it would print a nice scroll around your text too, in ascii chars
 michaellan: oh my god i still have it
 Wontonimo: what?
 michaellan: the program
 michaellan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clbin.com/TfD47">https://clbin.com/TfD47</a>

 Wontonimo: but the ones i remember the most were on a "rainbow 100" from digital equipment corporation.  It ran CP/M (not dos)
 xxd: those terms i have never heard of, sadly
 xxd: the tech world accelerates devilishly fast
 Wontonimo: nope TranTuan1.  don't paste Clashes here.  There is a discord channel for that
 Wontonimo: turn that scroll thing into a practice on CG, with the width auto calculated from the text
 xxd: heh
 Wontonimo: it will live on through the ages
 xxd: maybe the width that minimizes the # of extra spaces
 xxd: added
 xxd: wait that doesnt quite work per se
 xxd: ahhahaa i like the idea of that
 xxd: i am too busy with C4 for now, though&#160;:)
 xxd: I think i fixed it but I still lose
 xxd: I guess the solution is *not* to play at 3/5 first turn
 xxd:&#160;:/
 michaellan: wow darkhorse6 4 says he gets 2mil rollouts
 michaellan: i only get half that
 michaellan: in a second

 TranTuan1: please
 Wontonimo: don't post here
 TranTuan1: sorry
 Wontonimo: i think the channel is #clashofcode
 Wontonimo: or #coc
 Wontonimo: i mean, do chat here TranTuan1, just not clash invites
 xxd: i'm so confused
 xxd: after "balancing" by outputting 7, my rank drops
 xxd: 7 is one of the balanced ones right?
 xxd: I will just stick to 3/5 for now since I get a higher rank with that xD
 xxd: but i will keep the STEAL bugfix
 TranTuan1: I I think this channel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6woCHjGCBXqpf91SsAcoQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6woCHjGCBXqpf91SsAcoQ</a>
 TranTuan1: codingame channel
 xxd: no, thats not what he means
 xxd: he means, don't post clash links in the WORLD chat
 xxd: you are in World right now
 xxd: type "/join clash"
 xxd: okay i think trying to play balanced is harming ranking, since theres apparently a bunch of Wood2 bots that wont steal?
 TranTuan1: I don't think like that
 xxd: back to ~40th&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: you are 26th 
 ProCoder03: do you always use MCTS @xxd???
 xxd: i'm going to go back down once stabilization
 xxd: OH MY GOD
 xxd: MY BOT IS BEATING EULER's
 xxd: wait am i seeing this right
 xxd: i'm gonna drop to 40-50 ithink

 xxd: wow, im at  a loss for words
 xxd: i appreciate this, it means a lot
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: it's not exactly like your code
 xxd: yeah
 xxd: but its more suitable for a CoC
 ProCoder03: does atleast C++ have MCTS tutorials&#160;???
 xxd: stop trying to do things language specific
 xxd: theres not that big difference
 ProCoder03: I am not going language specific , I need to learn MCTS and C# doesn't seem to have a tutorial :disappointed:
 xxd: okay...
 xxd: I looked at python MCTSs on github and language-agnostic youtube videos to understand MCTS
 xxd: then some people here helped me with some specific optimization-related things in C++
 Westicles: mcts c++, About 459,000 results
 ProCoder03: I have understood MCTS algo, But I find it a little difficult to implement it on my own&#160;!!

 martinpapa69: stupid pie role in c4. cba implementing it
 xxd: facts
 Westicles: hmm, another of my clashes got killed by the mod bot
 xxd: i literally just output 3/5
 xxd: still gets me a higher rank
 xxd: outputting balanced number = ~100
 xxd: outputting best for me = ~30
 xxd: i wonder what optimizations people do to their MCTSs that they arent sharing

 ProCoder03: ohhhh... Really&#160;?? 
 martinpapa69: yee it wasnt that long
 Wartek: Hi guys, I'm doing the ocean of code and have been stuck on rank 1 for atleast 15min, is that normal?
 Wartek: when checking the last battles tab it shows that all the battles are done
 Wartek: any clue why no promotion happens?
 ProCoder03: see the detailed leaderboard 
 ProCoder03: you will see the time you are gonna be promoted 
 ProCoder03: you will be promoted in some regular intervals
 Wartek: oh I see, I'm rank 1 but my score is still lower than the boss
 Wartek: that's probably the reason no promition happens
 Wartek: thx!
 ProCoder03: np
 darkhorse64: I cannot be 100% sure but it seems you are not ranked above the boss. Therefore, you will not be promoted
 Wartek: ye indeed, that was the reason @darkhorse
 darkhorse64: Not 100% sure because higher leagues cannot see lower leagues boss ranking. The only workaround I know of is to look at last boss match to get an idea of its level
 Wartek: it's wood level
 Wartek: it's also quite hard to get out of wood it seems, never took me this long with other contests
 Wartek: either this one is harder or I'm being stupid somewhere
 darkhorse64: This one is definitively harder. The "easiest" way is to write a tracker for the opponent
 Wartek: already have one
 Wartek: not good enough it seems :D
 Wartek: still got some ideas, just remembering when I did other contests it was always trivial in comparison with this
 darkhorse64: You need to track everything: torpedoes, mines. Any explosion should give you a piece of information. You can get to gold with a complete tracker
 Wartek: atm there are no mines, tracking torpedos and enemy actions using some kind of Monte Carlo algorithm. Seems to track pretty good on the small test examples I test. I'm thinking of adding a legit silence now to throw of the enemy of tracking me. Only drawback atm i have is that when enemy uses silence my tracking gets reset, have to find somehting smarter for that :D
 Wartek: so basically:1) Implement a silence that is not 02) find a way to keep tracking after enemy uses silence$
 Wartek: if that doesn't promote me to bronze idk what will :D
 indratej: hi
 Panavia_tornado: can you give puzzles for linear programming?
 Lekrkutj: what do you guys think is the best programming language to learn as a teenager right now
 Lekrkutj: like what will be the most useful in the next like 10 years
 Stilgart: C
 Stilgart: easy to learn, basis of the majority of other languages
 Wartek: C to get the fundamentals, python to have fun and actually write useful code in short time
 TobiasA: html to program robots
 Lekrkutj: C as in C++? or is there a language called C
 TobiasA: yea
 TobiasA: c++ was made from c
 TobiasA: most languanges i think or some
 TobiasA: at least the most important ones
 Lekrkutj: okay thank you
 Lekrkutj: And you say C to get the fundamentals, but i already took a Html css and javascript course. is it a good idea to start with python now?
 Storcha: stick to JS, you can mostly do everything with it
 Lekrkutj: okay thnx
 Storcha: but mostly it depends what you want to do with coding
 Storcha: if it's to have a job... no ideas
 Storcha: if it's for fun, JS or python are nice
 Storcha: (and they can also lead to a job I guess&#160;:))

 TimothyAlexisVass: is there a shorter way to get data than readline() in JavaScript?
 RightHandElf: I think you can use 'R=readline' and then 'R()' if you're using it more than once
 RightHandElf: obviously doesn't save any space if it's just once
 Wartek: when doing all the battles in a contest for your ranking, is there an easy way to see all your loses/timeouts?

 Thyl: Hi I want to do a Beam Search for FC2020 in c++
 Thyl: I use vector for stock node
 Thyl: and after fin all possible next state
 Thyl: i use sort for find the 1000 best nodes
 Thyl: but vector in cpp has a limit of memory 
 Thyl: an idea for stock&#160;?
 Thyl: *stock the nodes
 martinpapa69: use chokudaisearch
 martinpapa69: i dont understand this sentence tho "but vector in cpp has a limit of memory"
 ProCoder03: how to improve UTTT flat MC&#160;??
 darkhorse64: Thyl: Shrink the nodes
 Thyl: martinpapa69 I have bad alloc so much I stock in vector
 martinpapa69: ahh i see. thats a general memory limit, not only for vectors. but if you use beam search
 darkhorse64: How many nodes do you allocate&#160;?
 martinpapa69: you dont have too keep the history of your nodes
 martinpapa69: you need a vector for the i-th nodes and the i+1th
 Thyl: darkhorse64
 Thyl: all states
 Thyl: and my simulation is quite strong for go to a cool deep
 Thyl: martinpapa69&#160;????
 Thyl: Who i sort the nodes&#160;???
 darkhorse64: There are also many transpositions in the game so it's worth detecting those to use less nodes. It will increase the search quality
 AllYourTrees: how big are transposition tables normally?
 nan_00: hello ,I'm struggling with linked lists I would appreciate any recommendation of a good website or any youtube lectures
 Thyl: do you have a link for know Beam Search 
 Thyl:  ????
 Thyl: with atutorial if it possible&#160;?&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: my state fits on 32 bits so my hash table is just a set&lt;int&gt;
 jacek: use unordered_set [solved]
 Thyl:  32 bits
 Thyl:&#160;????
 Thyl: I am stuck in Beam Search
 darkhorse64: yep, unordered_set&lt;int&gt;. Actually, I use only 25 bits
 Thyl: ... and bitboarding
 Thyl: :D
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/11358/breadth-first-search-and-beam-search-comparison">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/11358/breadth-first-search-and-beam-search-comparison</a>
 darkhorse64: *bitfields for a*
 Thyl: ok
 Thyl: I can use a queue for beam search
 Thyl: like a bfs
 Thyl:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: an ordered list may work better for beam
 Thyl: what is it in c++
 Thyl: thx darkhorse64&#160;:) 
 Thyl: Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: Thyl
 Wontonimo: i'd write my own ordered list by inserting it in a linked list
 Wontonimo: given a-&gt;b-&gt;d-&gt;e
 Wontonimo: to add c,link c-&gt;d, and change b-&gt;c
 Thyl: ok thank Wontomino
 Wontonimo: the result isa-&gt;b=&gt;c-&gt;d-&gt;e
 Wontonimo: where the "=" is the only modified element
 Wontonimo: and c-&gt; is new
 Wontonimo: if you are using a pre-allocated pool, then these "pointers" are just ints.
 Wontonimo: i'm sure there is some library that is faster for large beam sizes
 Wontonimo: if you order your beam from smallest to largest and store the size as an int, then you can immediately test if the new item should just be discarded if it is less than the first item and would make the size too large
 Thyl: Do you have an exemple of beam search in c++&#160;???
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: not in any language
 Uljahn: there is std::nth_element, guess it could be used in beam search too

 TobiasA: what league?
 michaellan: Wood 1
 michaellan: also, g'day TobiasA 
 TobiasA: hi xxd
 TobiasA: i forgot there was only 2 leagues
 michaellan: yeah, its a small community challenge
 Scarfield: that was fast xxd, well done :muscle:
 michaellan: I want closure on the Mars Lander 2 puzzle... it irks me 
 michaellan: Thanks Scarfield!
 ProCoder03: use pids 
 TobiasA: i use -x*vel
 ProCoder03: Then tweak your GA for Mars lander 3
 michaellan: my GA is broken in ways I cannot fathom
 ProCoder03: ohhhh
 michaellan: I think both my physics sim and GA are both broken
 Scarfield: do you determine elite genomes, and dont change them, from generation to generation?
 michaellan: I dislike how they chose not to open the referee to force people to reverse-engineer the exact physics
 michaellan: yup
 michaellan: I have a population of 40 and copy over top 8 each time
 michaellan: actually i'd say there's a 99% chance the error lies in my simulation/evaluation
 Scarfield: do you introduce new random genomes, not sure if this is necessary, but seemed to help not converging to fast on a bad solution
 michaellan: hmm interesting, i do not do that currently
 Scarfield: i dont think its necessary at all though, just seemed to help in my case
 michaellan: my distance detection *seems* suspicious, because for mars lander 3 Cave - Wrong side it keeps converging to just dropping straight down
 michaellan: ok
 michaellan: also I think my ship falls faster (accelerates downward faster?) on CG than local simulation
 michaellan: somehow
 Scarfield: for eval i had some different stages, still flying at end of genome, out of bounds, crashed (score for distance along surface to landing zone, reaching landing zone
 xxd: understood
 Scarfield: then when reaching landing zone, score reward when vels are correct, and if vel.y to great, subtract the vel.y from score, to prefere slower landings
 michaellan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clbin.com/zbGHC">https://clbin.com/zbGHC</a>
 michaellan: Is this wrong?
 michaellan: or i should ask, how off am I with these scoring metric
 michaellan: :rofl:
 Uljahn: xxd: thrust can't be changed more than 1 per turn, guess that's why you fall faster on CG
 xxd: hmm, my genome genes represent changes in thrust so [-1,0,1]
 xxd: I dont think that is problem
 xxd: maybe floating point conversion errors somehow though, since I use ints
 xxd: but floats for all the sim
 xxd: Does anyone use GA? I have some GA questions sepcifically
 Scarfield: yea
 xxd: Like: should I use Continuous Genetic Algorithm where the crossover is a weighted average of the two parents?
 xxd: it just feels a bit wrong... since for example thrust can only be [-1, 0, 1]
 Scarfield: there are so many ways to do it, i think many ways would work, i simply choose a random spot to split so AAAA / BBBB could be ABBB / BAAA or AABB / BBAA
 Uljahn: guess you've seen this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/</a>
 Scarfield: then smooth out the changes in angle and thrust if they are to great, super simple and works ok
 Scarfield: too great *

 xxd: so scarfield it sounds like you use angle and thrust, not changes in angle and changes in thrust right?
 ProCoder03: where do you guys learn abt AI algos&#160;?? I just got confused after reading that GA article&#160;???
 ProCoder03: :confused:
 xxd: read it and google things until you understand
 Scarfield: yea xxd, but either way will work fine
 xxd: and then still fail to emulate the implementation&#160;:(
 Scarfield: you can use arrays AliRazzaghi, but you actually dont need to. you can keep track of what temperature currently is the closests during the loop where you get the input. if a new input temp is closer (remember the +/- rule) overwrite your variable for closests temp
 AliRazzaghi: ok thanks
 Wontonimo: hey ProCoder03, did you watch that series of AI videos I sent you? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZBTDzGeGg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZBTDzGeGg</a>
 Wontonimo: I rewatch the same video about 5 times.  The first time I pause right before any big reveal and try to come to the conclusion before the lecturer tells it.  I'll spend a few days doing that for each pause
 Wontonimo: so each video become a week or two research, self study, and review
 Wontonimo: along with trying to actually implement it
 Wontonimo: tbh ProCoder03, i rarely come to the same conclusion as what the lecturer reveals but the process of trying to get there is mind expanding, and then seeing the reveal is even more profound and memorable now that I have personal context of the issues and challenges around the problem
 ProCoder03: I have gone through it, but i just watched it as a Lecture taking notes and so on as it. But I have never followed as you did. 
 ProCoder03: Ig i will give it a try like you did&#160;!! 
 ProCoder03: Thanks :wink:
 Scarfield: any specific algo you want to learn ProCoder03?
 Wontonimo: world domination algo
 Scarfield: im already working on that, but wont share
 ProCoder03: well first on my list is MCTS , I can understand it but can't implement it , it is difficult&#160;!!
 ProCoder03: then other all whole lot of algos you all speak :confounded:
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a>
 Wontonimo: have you broken it into the 4 stages, one function for each&#160;: select, expand, rollout, backprop
 Scarfield: this is the best video i have found explaining MCTS, but if your problem is implementing it, its not much help&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: Scarfield that is my fav video about MCTS, i share it often!
 ProCoder03: I actually saw that video to understand MCTS&#160;!!
 Scarfield: yea its so short, clear and easier to understand than anything else i watched
 ProCoder03: I am stuck at expand , but i guess will try to solve it myself 
 Wontonimo: that video has everything you need to make unit tests for each of the 4 steps individually
 Scarfield: his minimax and AB videos are just as great
 Wontonimo: tell me about expand?
 ProCoder03: well I am just out of ideas on how to implement it.....
 ProCoder03: I tried 1 or 2 but to no use
 Wontonimo: what kind of structure are you using to keep the whole MCTS tree?
 ProCoder03: A class Node with some parameters like Parent, Childern and some more 
 ProCoder03: Then a Tree with just one Node called Root 
 Wontonimo: okay, so the only thing expand does is to fill out the children if it is missing and this is not a terminal node
 Wontonimo: you can even skip the check for being a terminal node for now
 Wontonimo: so, if your Node is tictactoe, and represents this boardX _ XO _ OX _ _
 Wontonimo: would you know how to create the children nodes?
 Wontonimo: because that is all expand does
 ProCoder03: hmmm.... A root node with this state , for each possible move create a childern 
 ProCoder03: am i right&#160;??
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's it
 ProCoder03: Ohhhh.....
 AntiSquid: O _ O
 Wontonimo: for bonus points, return one of them randomly
 Wontonimo: for not so many bonus points, return the first child
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid, am I missing something?
 ProCoder03: Rollout is just Simulate which plays one move , right&#160;?? 
 ProCoder03: till terminal 
 Wontonimo: right
 AntiSquid: those look like emotes X_X
 Wontonimo: i don't know what you mean by "which plays one move"
 Wontonimo: rollout means play till terminal
 AntiSquid: he probably forgot a comma 
 Wontonimo: I find it VERY useful to literally implement these 4 steps as 4 functions of exactly the same name with no dependency on eachother
 ProCoder03: okay, then backpropagte is adding the score to the parent node till root 
 Wontonimo: that way you can write a unit test for each independently 
 Wontonimo: yes, that's right
 ProCoder03: Awesome I guess I got it&#160;!!!!
 ProCoder03: Thanks @wontonimo
 AntiSquid: what's the best C (exploration) value&#160;?
 Wontonimo: for adversarial games you want to make sure the score is in the point of view of the current node's player
 ProCoder03: will try tomorrow&#160;!!!
 ProCoder03: @antisquid ig it is 2
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid - the C that gives you the highest ranking on the leaderboard
 Wontonimo: :P
 ProCoder03: "for bonus points, return one of them randomly" what do you mean&#160;??
 ProCoder03: so for Tic Tac Toe if the current player is me, the score is +ve or else -ve 
 ProCoder03: am i right&#160;??
 Wontonimo: X 1 XO 4 OX 7 8if this is the parent, and it makes children for the moves 1,4,7,8 then expand creates the children, attaches them to the parent and returns one of the children, move 1,4,7, or 8
 DJRedWorm_aa4c: hi guys
 Wontonimo: hi DJRedWorm_aa4c
 ProCoder03: wdym by bonus points, is it score or just a tip&#160;???
 Wontonimo: a tip
 ProCoder03: Thanks&#160;!!!
 Wontonimo: i don't understand "if the current player is me, the score is +ve or else -ve".  can you ask another way
 ProCoder03: "for adversarial games you want to make sure the score is in the point of view of the current node's player" with reference to tic tac toe 
 Wontonimo: yeah, so as you walk up the parent tree, each node will be associated with a player who made that move.
 Wontonimo: if the winner of the rollout equals that player, that node gets positive reward.
 Wontonimo: etc
 Wontonimo: it's not to do with who's turn it is in the actual game.
 jdsigg: Hey for any avid clashers out there, if your program prints correctly, but terminates due to an error, I believe you get credit for the output anyway
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no clashers here.
 eulerscheZahl: that's generally the case for all text-based puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: for the last line it also doesn't matter if you print with or without line separator
 jdsigg: Helped me squeeze some characters out of a shortest-mode clash
 jdsigg: Nice, thanks for the tip
 ja_fica: _Royale, do you use regular MTCS solver in C4?
 Wontonimo: do you ja_fica?
 AllYourTrees: oooh ya lets get some DEETS
 jacek: what is irregular mcts solver
 _Royale: ja_fica: hi, I have the same question as jacek&#160;:)
 jacek: :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Or a slime MCTS solver? Or a baggy one?
 AllYourTrees: i like how the C4 has a couple different groups right now
 jacek: you can use some clustering on leaderboard
 AllYourTrees: my questions are: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5836c11a-cfd8-489b-b50e-04dd322ed5f1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5836c11a-cfd8-489b-b50e-04dd322ed5f1</a>
 AllYourTrees: - how much avx are you using
 Wontonimo: i do none of that, and that's probably why i'm still at 20th
 RoboStac: for the key I use xorshift* on the p1state / p2state and xor those together to get 64bits
 jacek: NN structures, as always, MLP with one-hots inputs
 RoboStac: nn is Dense layers, 189-&gt;128-&gt;128-&gt;128-&gt;9+1
 jacek: i use value only, as always
 RoboStac: I don't do any transposition on the mcts side but do cache nn results
 Qbyte: where did y'all learn all this?
 Qbyte: udemy?
 AllYourTrees: ya'll are the best thanks for the answers!!
 AllYourTrees: i learned this over years and years on personal time and work lol
 Qbyte: neat!
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still a noob how pretends to know&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN outed me
 eulerscheZahl: who*
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl is there a way?
 eulerscheZahl: to get the code of the contest of the code of the contest?
 jacek: Automaton2000 where do frogs come from
 Automaton2000: is there any way to see the problem with my code i have to look for
 Qbyte: dw bruh 99% of the time that we coders think we dont know anythink it's just the imposter syndrom
 jacek: sus
 TobiasA: you typed sus backwards
 jacek: sns
 TobiasA: you typed sus downside up
 Wontonimo: no, it's not flipped upside down. it is rotated 180 degrees
 TobiasA: on what axis?

 Swyfti: The Codingame chat is like me: sometimes it is full of messages, and sometimes it is dead.
 Astrobytes: The codingame chat never blames anything on 'Daniel'.Just saying.
 Wontonimo: just start talking about your current coding project.  bingo, not dead
 Swyfti: my current coding project? why do you guys want to hear about it lol
 kresteodymium: orz asdasd
 kresteodymium: orz asdasasd

 Swyfti: me too astrobytes
 Swyfti: im not really a minimalist
 Swyfti: try to make meaning out of most things
 sadboy69: xc
 jacek: nyoro~n
 kresteodymium: Astrobytes two messages dont count as spam
 kresteodymium: btw
 Astrobytes: kresteodymium: when they're garbage, they do.Btw.
 Swyfti: i simply ignore meaningless stuff, unless you are a moderator
 kresteodymium: Astrobytes subjective analysis sadge
 kresteodymium: it was out of mere appreciation for a fellow cogdingamer
 kresteodymium: *codingamer
 Astrobytes: Feel fee to clarify that with some context next time because it looks like gibberish to the rest of us.
 kresteodymium: yep 
 kresteodymium: asdasasd is the name of the person
 kresteodymium: orz is appreciating
 Swyfti: now it makes sense :upside_down:
 kresteodymium:&#160;:)
 Swyfti: there are a lot of people called asdasasd lmao
 kresteodymium: lol
 Swyfti: either way i am going to play some chess now
 Astrobytes: you could pm them, or if clashing, use the clash chat. But thank you for the uh, clarification nonetheless.
 Gabbek: Hello everyone, how's the evening?
 Astrobytes: Hello Gabbek, not so bad. You?
 Astrobytes: Nerchio pinged you earlier btw.
 Gabbek: Spoke with him on discord, thanks! Pretty good, the results are in from locm contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://legendsofcodeandmagic.com/COG21/index.html#Results">https://legendsofcodeandmagic.com/COG21/index.html#Results</a>
 Gabbek: happy to report that for once something is pretty decent :D
 Astrobytes: Oh, didn't know jakub was still running that. You both participated?
 Astrobytes: Wait, did you win?
 Gabbek: Nerchio didn't, I've tried my best because I've promised aCat and I've liked 1.0 ... 1.2 seemed even better so it was quite interesting
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: dijkstra's algo in python &gt;.&lt;
 Gabbek: yep, guess I should try to improve 1.0 version as well now, hehe -- after throughout reading of rules I know I've missed atleast two quite important details last time&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Nice! Well done&#160;:) Are they still offering prize money? I think Anti Squid won last time, took a while but he got his money eventually.
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Automaton2000 you should write the code for me
 Automaton2000: they should not be the best for me
 Gabbek: aye, it's still there. There's a plan for next version in the next year - AoE abilities and full deck-building [non-arena style] (from a pool of randomly selected cards)
 Astrobytes: I would probably try that one at least.
 Gabbek: Great! I'll forward that to jakub, I know he's planning to bring 1.2 to cg as well
 Wontonimo: hey MaliciouslyCrypticUsername, what are you using that algo for?
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:?
 Gabbek: Or maybe I should clarify - to make it public, as it's available as demo right now (but there were some issues with making it public etc.)
 Astrobytes: Also MCU, I would imagine python is one of the easier languages to implement that in?
 Astrobytes: Yes I understand Gabbek
 Wontonimo: jacek?
 Wontonimo: i !understand
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: he's advertising paper soccer again
 jacek: i never said that
 Astrobytes: ...
 jacek: but dijsktra could be helpful there ~
 Astrobytes: I'll get around to playing it one day
 Wontonimo: hey, have you tried that one jacek?  looks interesting
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wontonimo nothing, just trying to figure out how to write it, in case I need it :p
 Astrobytes: He made it Wontonimo :D
 Wontonimo: ik
 Astrobytes: Ah.
 jacek: counter trolling eh
 Astrobytes: How countrolling
 Wontonimo: i can see the "By jacek" and that wacky smile he always has on like he just finished the whole bottle of glue
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Gabbek: haha, good one :D
 Wontonimo: i wish i could be that happy 
 Astrobytes: There are other ways besides glue...
 jacek: :rage:
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry jacek
 Wontonimo: really&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: I'm looking at paper soccer and nothing is coming to me about how to efficiently approach that game
 Wontonimo: you mentioned dijsktra, and yeah conceptually shortest distance makes sense, but *how*?
 jacek: one part of my eval
 Astrobytes: ab or ept?
 Wontonimo: if i knew this game in school my grades would have been lower
 jacek: i.e. like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/YaPaperSoccer/blob/master/ai_readme/bfs_combined.mp4">https://github.com/jdermont/YaPaperSoccer/blob/master/ai_readme/bfs_combined.mp4</a>
 jacek: mcts with biased rollouts
 jacek: well this one isnt exactly fully dijkstra, 
 Astrobytes: Hmm, nice
 Gabbek: interesting! Yikes... the amount of games I want to try grows every day&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I'm trying to ignore community ones right now and work through the official CG ones Gabbek
 Astrobytes: And optim when I get tired of something.
 Maxim251: paper soccer O my gosh, long time in school I was playing that game with colegues waiting for lessons when there was a break
 Wontonimo: blasphemy
 Gabbek: Astrobytes same - still like 4 or 5 official ones left; tried optim last month - really fun, especially zombies and I've loved code rings
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: (mean at Astrobytes)
 Wontonimo: *meant
 Wontonimo: oh my, i should just give up
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: I must focus! Community multis suck your time&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: isn't that the point?
 Swyfti: is dijkstra's algorithm different from a*
 Astrobytes: Gabbek: Yeah, I'm gonna rewrite a few of mine I think. Currently trying to get legend in tron
 Wontonimo: it seems like a flood-fill version of a* to me
 Wontonimo: what's your algo for tron?
 Astrobytes: yeah, Dijkstra goes for all paths, the A* uses the admissible heuristic to only choose certain nodes
 Astrobytes: alphabeta, paranoid, voronoi
 Wontonimo: with bitboard, that should do it
 Maxim251: in that game important is to mark intersections, not point where ball is. 
 Astrobytes: bitboards in tron?
 Wontonimo: ah, no.  never mind
 Gabbek: Good luck with tron! Paper soccer seems fun, should try in about one year I hope :D
 Wontonimo: for alphabeta you don't need it
 Scarfield: smitsi did bitboards for ocean of code iirc
 jacek: smits did bitboards for everything
 Maxim251: Dijkstra wil not help in that game case, 
 Gabbek: I admire you guys whenever I hear about bitboards :p
 Wontonimo: get in on it Gabbek
 Maxim251: I do char-board, :D
 Wontonimo: what's holding you back?
 Gabbek: hmm, I've tried a bit in UTTT, failed utterly&#160;:) guess I'll give it a go eventually. At the moment I'm enjoying platinum rift episode 2 -- really fun with fog of war; what's holding me back - mostly the amount of cool games to try out!
 Astrobytes: PR2 is a cool game yeah
 Gabbek: feels so weird without leagues, think I'm too used to them now :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's weird going between the older and newer ones&#160;:)
 Gabbek: feels quite nice as well to see that the changes are indeed improvements&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: it wood be nice if the community multis had bronze/silver/gold/legend 
 Astrobytes: I see what you did there
 Astrobytes: Not enough players though, that's the reason
 Gabbek: let's try to push one of them to 500 and see if it actually works :P
 Astrobytes: lol, I'm not 100% convinced it would :D
 Gabbek: vindium is closest? 323
 Gabbek: vindinium*
 Astrobytes: I haven't checked the numbers recently. Hard to get new participants unless the game becomes puzzle of the week. I blame the lack of visibility.
 Astrobytes: Also, the community games tend to be a little harder to progress in for the average user.
 Gabbek: I agree. I haven't knew about multi games for the longest time.
 Wontonimo: well because -you-people- submit killer bots
 Gabbek: that "compete" button (maybe it was even called something else earlier? Can't remember) always scared me
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I remember discussing this with you and a few others some time back in chat. Doesn't mean you have to compete with anyone other than yourself&#160;;)
 otomagari: hellooo
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: They do attract a lot of hardcore CGers
 Gabbek: yeah, I meant that it probably scares off beginners - thinking back when I saw that button, so that's an additional factor to lack of visibility.
 Gabbek: hello otomagari
 eulerscheZahl: Gabbek 09:34PMvindium is closest? 323dots and boxes has more
 eulerscheZahl: and connect4 will soon outrank vindinium too
 Gabbek: thanks for the heads up, how's the evening?
 eulerscheZahl: just back from sports
 eulerscheZahl: :soccer:
 Astrobytes: Nice. Must be satisfying to be playing regularly again.

 Gabbek: congrats! What's that?
 Astrobytes: Meh. Looked at that. 1. I have no Ethereum wallet 2. JS?!
 Astrobytes: Game didn't look awful mind you.

 eulerscheZahl: i haven't won anything yet
 eulerscheZahl: still have to decide how much i want to get into it
 eulerscheZahl: but looks more promising that that gocoder hypersonic contest
 Astrobytes: is that running again?
 eulerscheZahl: JS. I don't really know the language but not that hard to pick it up
 eulerscheZahl: gocoder is working on their next thing with some changes. i don't know any details
 eulerscheZahl: closed beta testing
 Gabbek: out of curiosity, where do you find those games/contests?
 Gabbek: think I would like to give it a try one day, if I would know a bit earlier about something like that
 eulerscheZahl: cg discord, someone linked it
 Gabbek: thanks!
 Astrobytes: euler, did RAIC email something about shipping addresses? I have no notifications and nothing on my tracker
 Astrobytes: *something extra recently
 Gabbek: I have to go and do small shopping, see you later!
 Astrobytes: see you later Gabbek!
 eulerscheZahl: i received an email to enter my shipping details about 2 months ago
 Astrobytes: Yeah same, I did that
 eulerscheZahl: in this mail they stated that they'll start sending the parcels around last week
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, just checked. Didn't notice that part :D
 Astrobytes: Thanks for the clarification!
 Maxim251: How is named program where I can draw visually classes and functions like mindMap
 eulerscheZahl: UML editor?
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. enterprise architect
 Astrobytes: Or just use a whiteboard/paper (the former is better)
 eulerscheZahl: and then send that whole whiteboard to your teammates
 eulerscheZahl: use a permanent marker or the drawing will suffer at shipping
 Maxim251: like in this link

 Maxim251: :D transparent..
 eulerscheZahl: you can totally do this with enterprise architect
 Astrobytes: lol euler, I mean if it's just for himself...
 eulerscheZahl: there are some free tools as well. some easier to use than others
 Astrobytes: The class visualiser in VS is OK too

 Maxim251: My problem with coding on C++ is that I have bad habbit of puting functions in side of class in wrong place, and then I have extra coding  just to get what i want. Where later I am wondering if simpler will be make function in another class, to make 300 lines shorter. Belive me, is a pain to delete so much code, and begin one more time with different approach. 
 callmemr.yz: what is the the best way to  i improve my programing?
 Maxim251: Thats why, i was thinking if I could first visualise my plans for cerating structures, and plan where and what to place
 Maxim251: #callmemr.yz doing puzzles like me?
 Maxim251: And a lot of research on wiki and similar pages
 callmemr.yz: oh nice
 Maxim251: I start coding last Year. You can check my account to see what I achived. iwish You this same
 callmemr.yz: i start last year too 
 callmemr.yz: Is this site realy useful&#160;?
 callmemr.yz: :sweat_smile:
 jacek: do you have any experience with coding?
 jacek: it improves what you know, it is not for complete beginners
 callmemr.yz: very little in uni
 callmemr.yz: oooom , good

 Ran_42: what?
 michaellan: hello hello hello
 michaellan: I don't have time for CodinGame today&#160;:(
 LittleFlea: hey hey xxd i see you chat often and wanted to say hi at least once.
 michaellan: Hi!
 LittleFlea: i am so focused on these code i forget to socialize
 michaellan: I chat a lot because I have a lot of questions&#160;:(
 michaellan: haha
 michaellan: what are you working on at the moment?
 Astrobytes: lol, petite puce
 LittleFlea: i am going through the medium puzzle.currently the stock exchange
 LittleFlea: oh un francais aussi
 Astrobytes: non, I speak a little&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: xxd hey there
 LittleFlea: you speak a little-flea.badum tssss
 michaellan: hello astro
 Astrobytes: :drum:
 michaellan: I got C4 working&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Ah nice one! Decent rank?
 michaellan: last night
 michaellan: #20 in Wood 1!!
 Astrobytes: Niiiice!. I'm impressed
 michaellan: thanks
 LittleFlea: i tried the card trading game earlier and ouch i will come back later for it.
 michaellan: that one, LoCM, was my first bot programming one
 michaellan: well other than CSB
 Astrobytes: I'm currently ignoring (it's difficult) the community games and focusing on the 'official' multis
 Astrobytes: Ah LoCM
 LittleFlea: i am not familiar enough with the acronym for now sorry
 michaellan: Legends of Code &amp; Magic, no biggie
 Astrobytes: Legends of Code and Magic
 michaellan: yeah  the official multis I think are worht more codinpoints
 LittleFlea: and CSB
 Astrobytes: (locm or locam is how most people refer to it)
 michaellan: Coders Strike Back
 Astrobytes: (the pod racing)
 LittleFlea: oh that one is really nice
 michaellan: i hate that one :rofl:
 michaellan: I just suck at anything physics-related I think
 LittleFlea: 34th in bronze it seem
 Astrobytes: Better than nothing. You can come back to it sometime&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: xxd: yeah regarding points, was aiming for legend in Tron today and finally did it
 LittleFlea: yup for now there is not much "personalized code" its mostly logic from the tutorial
 Swyfti: is there an easier bot programming game i can try
 Astrobytes: That's cool. There's lots of info about it around the site so come back to it when you're ready LittleFlea
 LittleFlea: i found codingame so original that i actually took a step back from my udemy course.
 Astrobytes: Easier than copypasting Swyfti Daniel?
 Swyfti: im not daniel
 Swyfti: in fact, daniel is gone
 michaellan: Astrobytes: NICE
 Astrobytes: You can learn a lot here for sure LittleFlea, still gotta learn a lot off site though
 michaellan: in fact, daniel was never here, was he?
 Swyfti: he's not here anymore
 michaellan: i call BS, but i'll let you live your life
 Astrobytes: ^
 LittleFlea: oh i always have at least 10 tabs open for external source ahah
 Swyfti: im just asking if there is an easier bot programming game i can try
 michaellan: UTTT and C4 are very "vanilla" i guess youcan say
 michaellan: not much complicated logic
 Astrobytes: xxd: was that you in last place?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://legendsofcodeandmagic.com/COG21/index.html#Results">https://legendsofcodeandmagic.com/COG21/index.html#Results</a>
 michaellan: not sure what link you just sent
 michaellan: but I was not there to play the actual contest
 Astrobytes: this is this years COG contest using the 2 lane version
 Astrobytes: The one in last place is called AdvancedAvocadoAgent so I thought of you lol
 Swyfti: by the way what is C4?
 LittleFlea: a plastic explosive used in the army?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: On CG, Connect4, 7x9 board.
 michaellan: ah thats not me&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I see avocado and... :D
 michaellan: avocados are not my defining feature :rage:
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: Anyway, nice chatting but I gotta head to bed, late here
 michaellan: gn
 Astrobytes: cya later&#160;:)
 xxd: is Tron basically slither.io?
 michaellan: i dont get how someone would use MCTS/minimax for tron
 Wontonimo: let's say you have an eval, like floodfill for tron
 Wontonimo: and it does okay, it gets you to mid silver
 Wontonimo: that is now your eval for minimax
 Wontonimo: done
 Wontonimo: LittleFlea, don't just take 1 step back from udemy ... step way way back form udemy then run
 Wontonimo: Hey, congrats Astrobytes on Tron Legend
 LittleFlea: @Wontonimo would you care to elaborate.
 LittleFlea: ans also how do you write in red
 Wontonimo: imo self study has served me way better than udemy.  I feel dummer after udemy.  Things like codingame and just following open courses
 Wontonimo: ah, so you wrote in red when you invoked my name.  my name has that effect
 Wontonimo: well, for me anyway
 Wontonimo: that's my way of saying, text will appear red to you if someone uses your name.  No "@" is needed
 Wontonimo: for example, witness the power of red LittleFlea
 Wontonimo: funny story, when i first saw red text and my user name I thought it was a mod warning 
 LittleFlea: yeah i understand your point . no way am i gonna get only 1 source of knowledge.the course i follow helped me a lot to write more Beautifull code and faster. making some little app with winform and searching how to do certain fonction has been a big win for me.
 LittleFlea: Wontonimo you are banned!
 Wontonimo: again&#160;?!
 LittleFlea: i am so close to my solution in stock exchange
 Wontonimo: i thought i was already banned.  Isn't this the channel were the  banned people hang out?
 LittleFlea: lol good idea.banned people channel only.
 xxd: yeah, good ol' World
 xxd: stock exchange is a cool problem to play with different languages' idioms
 Wontonimo: oh, i did that one.  i don't even remember
 LittleFlea: i need like - 10.7 million for the large database problem and i get like -10.3
 Wontonimo: and in typescript of all things :thinking:  weird
 LittleFlea: for now i am doing everything in c#
 Wontonimo: good practice
 Wontonimo: is that your strongest lang atm?
 LittleFlea: yup
 Wontonimo: cool, you can do a lot with it
 LittleFlea: started a couple month ago.with 2 kids to keep me occupied ahah
 LittleFlea: well most of my friend who can help me are in c# or java
 Wontonimo: and before that?  What programming / hacking experience did you have?
 LittleFlea: i have a project to make a game i thought of 13 years ago. i played around in unity whilst using SO and MSDN .but i hit a wall and was recommended to get a language.in this case c# and get at least intermediate and advanced
 LittleFlea: i am not in a hurry and passionate so it is my me time in my head to code.
 michaellan: 13 years ago?
 michaellan: ah, cool
 LittleFlea: graphic .storyboard.voice acting.music are all taken care of.
 LittleFlea: i need to code it now lol
 michaellan: I can say coding is a lot more enjoyable when you don't put unreasonable deadlines on yourself :cry:
 Wontonimo: hey, Canada also.  nice
 LittleFlea: quebec here.
 Wontonimo: 13 years isn't an unreasonable deadline
 LittleFlea: ahahah
 Wontonimo: perhaps, maybe tighten that up
 michaellan: oh i was talking about myself
 michaellan: i was saying don't rush it
 Wontonimo: ^^ for sure
 LittleFlea: id like to finish the first chapter and make it public and see the hype around the game and starting a kickstarter for the other chapter.
 michaellan: dont get enamored by the idea of popularity and success, is my two cents
 michaellan: just be proud of the creation for what it is
 LittleFlea: watch out for God's Blessing.
 Wontonimo: hope to see you around LittleFlea.  There is lots more here than just challenges
 LittleFlea: totally
 Wontonimo: later
 LittleFlea: ill say hi next time we meet
 michaellan: he didnt even say bye to me
 michaellan: bye wontonomio
 michaellan: wontonimo
 michaellan: cant autocomplete his name cuz hes offline :sad:
 LittleFlea: what about you.what is your background xxd
 michaellan: I am a student and my background is largely competitive programming
 michaellan: I have since changed to contributing to open source, and writing AI on codingame
 LittleFlea: what do you mean by contribute.
 michaellan: fixing bugs, writing features, maintaining some (relatively small) repositories
 LittleFlea: which main language are you using.
 michaellan: for CodinGame or my open source work?
 michaellan: on codingame I use a lot of Python but mostly C++ for bot programming challenges
 michaellan: I also use quite a bit of Perl on Clash of Code
 LittleFlea: i wanted to try on with ruby and bash someday
 michaellan: ruby is nice. can't say the same for bash
 GeorgeDzigo: sup y'all
 GeorgeDzigo: it's 3:27 am
 LittleFlea: 20:28 here
 Swyfti: its 6:50 here
 Swyfti: pm
 LittleFlea: i got my stock challenge done! because of a small error of course.
 Swyfti: stock challenge?
 LittleFlea: stock loss puzzle.
 Swyfti: i see
 Swyfti: stock exchange losses?
 LittleFlea: yup
 Swyfti: its a nice puzzle
 LittleFlea: i had 50% and it was puzzling me.had to debug in visual studio to finally understand.
 michaellan: Swyfti: what you up to?
 masongtxr: help me with coder strike back league 3 please
 Swyfti: xxd wdym what am i up to
 Swyfti: im just doing code golf
 michaellan: league 3?
 michaellan: like what problem is what i meant
 michaellan: xxd
 LittleFlea: wassup.back for a couple hour
 Swyfti: the time right now is 8:51, i am going to bed now
 LittleFlea: good night
 LittleFlea: when coding for C4L bot.there need to be only 1 input for each while loop right?
 michaellan: only 1 input?
 michaellan: or 1 *output* do you mean?
 LittleFlea: output
 LittleFlea: in fact the system answered me when i tried
 LittleFlea: it seem fun but i do not know where to start since all the VAR are in separate for lood
 michaellan:&#160;?
 michaellan: what is lood
 LittleFlea: loop*
 michaellan: oh
 michaellan: just delete that code
 michaellan: that's the starter, it helps you if you don't know what to do
 LittleFlea: oh great.it was a hustle
 LittleFlea: sorry my bad english at time.it is getting late ahah

 TobiasA: does the ranking in search race get updates or no?
 5DN1L: your ranking gets updated every time you submit your code
 5DN1L: but cp gets updated only once a day
 TobiasA: I submitted my code but it didn't seem to update
 5DN1L: has it finished calculating all validators?
 TobiasA: yea 
 5DN1L: refresh?
 TobiasA: and I failed one
 5DN1L: ah
 TobiasA: I'm not able to view the replay though
 5DN1L: your best result is used in the ranking
 5DN1L: i see that your best result was 20,272.07 (100% pass)
 TobiasA: my best result got yea but my current code completes the course like 3 million times faster
 TobiasA: except that one
 5DN1L: pass rate counts first
 5DN1L: then the time
 TobiasA: how can I view the replay so I can try to fix it
 5DN1L: so failing one is still worse than 100% pass
 5DN1L: check the forum, there's a separate link for that i think
 derjack: how much time do you allocate
 derjack: most optim puzzles are bugged, and i allocate 30ms most for search race
 derjack: and still can rarely timeout
 TobiasA: i do 40
 derjack: try 20 first
 TobiasA: ok
 Dovee: Could somebody help me?
 TobiasA: thanks derjack it worked

 Maltava: Is there any way to view the validators for a puzzle to see what the problem actually is?
 Maltava: I'm doing the Horse Duals in Java, and the only one I'm failing is the "Horses in disorder" validator.
 5DN1L: No, there isn't a way
 jacek: generally you shouldnt see te validator
 jacek: but last test cases passes?
 Maltava: Yes, all test cases passed, and when I submit, everything succeeds except that one validator.
 Maltava: It's okay, I'll search on the forums for the puzzle. Thanks!

 Scarfield: still here struct?
 struct: yes
 Scarfield: the backgammon coach said that he does not think it should be possible to postpone a backgammon game, and win by pip score. Also that is rare that a game last more than 100 turns per player
 struct: So I dont need to implement it :p
 Scarfield: hahaha
 Scarfield: you can postpone the game, but its just not a winning strategy
 jacek: postpony games eh
 jacek: still, if youre losing, can you postpone enough to draw?
 Scarfield: maybe, without pip count, but going afk now though
 struct: I think its unlikely
 struct: you can only stall for so long
 jacek: why am i thinking about inputs to the NN instead of making sim first ~
 Wontonimo: because you love NN more than sim
 Darleanow: Hello guys
 Darleanow: Wonto its been a while :o
 Wontonimo: yeah, i've been here but in the background
 Wontonimo: what kind of practice have you been doing lately?
 Darleanow: OOP eheh
 Darleanow: i've coded some cool things
 Darleanow: which are on my git&#160;:)
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Darleanow: and now, i'm developping a text rpg game 
 Darleanow: Hello jacek&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: nice, that's fun.  what lang?
 Darleanow: Only py :p
 jacek: rogue?
 Wontonimo: did I ever share this demo text rpg with you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR">https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR</a>
 Wontonimo: you may have to run it locally
 Darleanow: not like a rogue, i mean i'm not sure
 Wontonimo: py is a good lang.  don't say "only py"
 TricePBaddie: only py
 Darleanow: but there is some progress, like monsters become stronger, and u can get equipement
 Darleanow: Yes u did, this is why i thought i'd know enough to do it&#160;!!
 Darleanow: The idea is inspired by u wonto )
 Wontonimo: oh cool!  thanks
 Darleanow: Eheh
 Darleanow: Do u have a favourite class or monster type that i could add&#160;?
 Wontonimo: slug
 Darleanow: I'll send u the source code, which will be on my git if u wanna give it a look
 Darleanow: Aight&#160;!!
 Darleanow: this isnt a very scary monster
 Wontonimo: yeah, DM me the link
 Wontonimo: how big of a slug are you thinking?  It can be pretty scary
 Darleanow: Aight, will do whenever it's finished&#160;!
 Darleanow: I mean u can be a giant
 Darleanow: even a 2 m wide slug wouldn't be that terrifying
 Wontonimo: and what if it is poisonous&#160;?
 Darleanow: Oh you're adding too much details ahahhaha
 Darleanow: I only have HP DEF and ATK 
 Darleanow: will maybe update it with some more features once it's done&#160;:)
 jacek: add poisonous frogs
 jacek: or toads
 Wontonimo: have you ever tried to squish a slug.  They are tough.  Imagine a 800 kg slug and how invincible it would be
 Darleanow: jacek i'll do it&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: anyway, I'm obviously a fan of humour monsters
 Darleanow: But i don't wanna add too many complex ideas, like poisonning and crit e.g.
 Wontonimo: good idea
 Darleanow: I like this kind of humour&#160;!

 waterproofsodium: so gotta solve some problems today
 waterproofsodium: instead of always doing clash :P
 Astrobytes: that's the spirit :D
 waterproofsodium: but clashes are good!
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you can do clashes in between puzzles&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: or the other way around ofc
 waterproofsodium: puzzles make me sleepy while clashes get my heartrate up
 waterproofsodium: it's wicked :D
 Astrobytes: lol, all good
 waterproofsodium: haha
 waterproofsodium: anyways you personally feel that you learn most from doing puzzles?
 Astrobytes: Personally speaking, yeah
 waterproofsodium: nice
 waterproofsodium: there has been quite a few thought about and had no idea how to approach
 waterproofsodium: do you perhaps have any advice for such situations?
 MSmits: hi
 Astrobytes: that's a good push to learn something new right there. Try to do work through it on paper/whiteboard. If it's an unfamiliar topic, do some research
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits
 MSmits: I figured out a way to do 37 and 38 seed oware DB :P
 Astrobytes: how so?
 waterproofsodium: hi MSmits
 MSmits: I was caching some intermediate result but I realized I can read this from HD in chunks and losing barely any speed. This gives me 10-15 GB extra RAM to work with
 waterproofsodium: thanks for the advice. I am wonder if I should prioritize learning tho. since I cannot learn everything there is. And researching for a difficult puzzle could take in average many hours
 Astrobytes: MSmits: oh nice! That should help indeed. Are you running it now?
 MSmits: it's still a lot of calculation though. I estimate 7-8 days for 37 and 11-12 days for 38
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: also I improved my meta mcts. Believe it or not, it seems better to just run a normal mcts when your DB is that big
 Astrobytes: waterproofsodium: of course don't try to learn everything, pick a topic, say graph theory or something
 Astrobytes: Meta MCTS is overkill?
 MSmits: i solve faster with a normal mcts in C# that just looks up at 36 seed, than running 10 c++ bots playing games and backpropagating
 Astrobytes: makes sense
 MSmits: the games just take a lot of calc time
 waterproofsodium: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: just a single rollout in C# works too
 MSmits: so that makes it run 1000 rollouts/s or so
 MSmits: and was 100 before, with 10 c++ games run in parallel
 Astrobytes: Nice. More convenient being in C# too.
 MSmits: yeah, i dont think c++ would be that much better at this point. All nodes are looked up from a persistent dictionary (so SSD)
 jacek: will there be a rematch?
 MSmits: maybe at some point if he's still doing it. I can probabyl arrange it
 Astrobytes: I am sensing that on the horizon jacek
 MSmits: i am just hoping i did not make a bug in redoing my DB program for 37 and 38, i am verifying 37 when it is done. 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't rush it
 MSmits: kinda sucks when it has to run this long
 MSmits: and then you find a bug
 MSmits: pretty sure universities have this happen to them a lot in the computer science faculties
 MSmits: wasting time
 Astrobytes: Yeah, plus deadlines
 waterproofsodium: is it good sports to ask for hints when doing a specific problem?
 Astrobytes: bad combo
 MSmits: btw i did that entry code puzzle, but I feel I cheated :P
 MSmits: i used wikipedia, like one my of students trying to cheat an assignment
 waterproofsodium: obviously I cannot "solve all the problems" in the world myself due to time constraints, so asking would make sense
 Astrobytes: waterproofsodium: if you are stuck and you know what you're asking hints about then sure. Also each puzzle has a forum thread with advice etc
 MSmits: I won't say where the solution is, but it is on wiki 
 MSmits: just adapted it a tiny bit
 Astrobytes: lol, hey it worked right :D
 MSmits: yep
 waterproofsodium: MSmits: I mean at that point I would have looked at the forum and not have found the info I was looking for
 MSmits: i found nothing on the forum either
 waterproofsodium: eh *Astrobytes (sorry)
 Astrobytes: it's a new puzzle that one right MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well, new to me anyways
 MSmits: waterproofsodium it's ok to ask for hints
 jacek: it is? oO
 Astrobytes: Back in yer box jacek :P
 MSmits: well it's not ok to expect an answer
 MSmits: but to ask is ok 
 waterproofsodium: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: As long as you can prove you've tried at least a few things, people are usually willing to help or point you in the right direction
 MSmits: it's just that a lot of times noone is on that knows the solution to your specific problem unless it is currently a *hot* topic
 MSmits: you have to know the solution to give a hint
 Astrobytes: Or at least be familiar with the problem
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: I am working on platinum rift 2 btw
 Astrobytes: ah nice, fun game
 MSmits: just trying to get something working. I never made a real multi agent bot unless you're counting those smitsimax solutions that are highly specific to some games
 waterproofsodium: I feel like just ignoring some problems until I have some insight
 MSmits: waterproofsodium there are hundreds of things to ignore on this site, just do what seems fun/interesting
 Astrobytes: that's probably wise, I mean you wouldn't attempt a number theory puzzle with zero number theory knowledge&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: obviously that I lack insight means that I never was faced a similar problem before (or forgot that)
 MSmits: a lot of times i taught myself somethign to solve a problem
 MSmits: like learning dancing links for that number shfiting puzzle
 Astrobytes: ^ this is what I've been saying MSmits
 MSmits: never heard of it before
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: gaining knowledge through doing puzzles or multis/whatever
 Astrobytes: versus clashes
 MSmits: sometimes you can figure out a solution and later learn it is some official algorithm that has a name, that you reinvented yourself
 MSmits:  this is how i reinvented binary search for batman :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: or most graph traversal things
 MSmits: yeah graph stuff
 MSmits: personally, I feel you should be able to say you invented something if someone invented it before you and you didn't know about it
 MSmits: it's just an ordering issue of two independent events
 Astrobytes: Smits-First Search
 MSmits: sure 
 waterproofsodium: I think you can legit say you invented it in that case. I would take no offense lol
 Astrobytes: well many discoveries in the past have been discovered around the same time by different people, in different locations
 MSmits: like calculus
 Astrobytes: And problems solved etc
 MSmits: or was it linear algebra?
 MSmits: Newton and Leibniz
 waterproofsodium: wasn't it integration?
 waterproofsodium: Newton and Leibniz
 MSmits: could be yeah
 Astrobytes: Something calculus-related
 waterproofsodium: cause I heard that on a talk like 1 week ago :D
 MSmits: I heard it 10 yrs ago
 j4at: I invented antiderivative
 Astrobytes: lol
 j4at: they should add my name to the text books
 MSmits: that's like a medicine you take when you are forced to do derivatives?
 waterproofsodium:&#160;:&gt;
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 jacek: im indifferent to calculus
 waterproofsodium: I think it's waht you take afterwards to deal with the long term side effects
 Astrobytes: the indefinite integral
 j4at: I tried to calculate pi and found out how to do antiderivative like 7 years ago
 Westicles: I'd like to make an exact cover puzzle where DLX is the only option to solve, but I think the input size on CG is too small to keep people from brute forcing instead
 j4at: before studying it 
 Roulio__: ruby is so  powerfulk
 MSmits: well noone actually calculated pi
 j4at: i mean estimation ...
 MSmits: yes, i meant you were exact in your statement
 MSmits: you tried :0
 SriniV: hola migos
 MSmits: anyone ever try netlogo?
 waterproofsodium: I hate not doing a problem, just because it feels to difficult. I'm really struggling rn :P
 MSmits: I learned it yesterday and it's the simplest language ever
 MSmits: more Englishy than python even
 Astrobytes: never tried it, heard of it, but no experience
 waterproofsodium: Is it a common experience that you have no idea how to solve a problem, but come back half a year later and had a better intuition?
 Astrobytes: Yes!
 MSmits: not sure if it is a real programming language but you use it to write multi agent models
 MSmits: I thought it would be a lot of work to learn, but i prepared a 2 hr class  in 30 mins without even knowing the program
 Astrobytes: yeah I came across it via something biology-related iirc
 SriniV: Hi
 SriniV: im in hs
 waterproofsodium: (in that case that "Yes!" was for me: Great. I'ma act according to that)
 MSmits: I did a rock paper scissors model with wolves eating sheep, eating butterflies eating wolves. Took 5 mins
 jacek: is this like logo and turtle
 MSmits: waterproofsodium another yes from me
 MSmits: yeah jacek
 Astrobytes: waterproofsodium :D
 waterproofsodium:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: butterflies eating wolves? :o
 MSmits: well they were standard available shapes
 MSmits: it did not have rocks and scissors
 MSmits: so i went with that :P
 Westicles: cue the schmetterling meme
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: Schmetterling!!
 waterproofsodium: :butterfly:
 MSmits: only Germans would call something cute a name like that :P
 MSmits: what do they call a ladybug i wonder
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: Marienk√§fer
 waterproofsodium: what's wrong with it? schmetter means litterally "to shatter"
 MSmits: there's nothing wrong with it, but to me it sounds like you're saying something dirty
 waterproofsodium: I'm joking about it. I'm aware of the horrible sound :D
 MSmits: hehe ok
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://preview.redd.it/9pw17lzxz0k51.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=928735be890d7c8232aac04a1f1cfed780ff84b4">https://preview.redd.it/9pw17lzxz0k51.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=928735be890d7c8232aac04a1f1cfed780ff84b4</a>
 MSmits: ohh thats it 
 Astrobytes: Took a while Westicles but there it is
 jacek: lul, isnt it
 MSmits: lol
 waterproofsodium: :laughing:
 MSmits: I can read German a little bit, but I can't speak it
 MSmits: we learn it in school, mandatory
 MSmits: but... 26 yrs ago
 waterproofsodium: ..mandatory
 MSmits: yeah, it's not fair, you guys don't learn Dutch
 waterproofsodium: literally nothing I ever learned mandatory sticked
 Astrobytes: French or German was mandatory here. Took German, ended up learning more French than German in later life :D
 waterproofsodium: there's mandatory French in Germany
 MSmits: well... French is mandatory as well here
 waterproofsodium: (for certain school paths)
 MSmits: You do German and French for 3 yrs and then you drop 1 
 MSmits: English is mandatory till the end, no choice there
 Astrobytes: we get one language and that's it. My uncle had the option of (amongst other things) Ancient Greek - same school, many years prior
 MSmits: oh yeah we also have ancient greek and latin as an option
 j4at: we learn German in school too and it was mandatory.. And I got 10% in Final exam because didn't study German at all 
 MSmits: and in my school specifically, also Chinse
 MSmits: Chinese
 j4at: I didn't even come to class :3
 waterproofsodium: ngl german is just cruel
 waterproofsodium: I'd rather learn C
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: dutch is apparently a harder language to learn. I can't tell because I am a native
 j4at: I'd rather learn assembly
 Westicles: I think in the US high school they purposefully teach us to mispronounce french so we'll fly over and piss them off later in life
 MSmits: they did some tests where they measure the age at which children become fluent in a language and with Dutch this happens later than any other European language
 Astrobytes: You mean you don't just learn other dialects of American English in the US? :D
 jacek: that means dutch children are delayed?
 MSmits: in their own language, somewhat yeah
 Astrobytes: It's all the cannabis
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: lol

 MSmits: so when you do a course in Arabic
 MSmits: you shall not pass&#160;?
 waterproofsodium: there's some deeper truth about cat persons here
 Razovsky: i am not
 Razovsky: a cat person
 Razovsky: i see you
 MSmits: i see your profile pics
 Razovsky: i don't know what you mean by that
 MSmits: ok
 Razovsky: XD

 Razovsky: how are you MSmits, have'nt seen you in a while
 waterproofsodium: obviously we could argue whether his pfp is a cat. since earphones greatly reduce the confidence of any classifier
 MSmits: yeah i've been on a bit of a CG break, partially caused by work
 MSmits: filled in for a colleague that was on paternal leave
 Razovsky: actually, same
 Razovsky: cool from you
 MSmits: well i do get paid for this, but i normally don't work that much
 struct: There are opening books for backgammon o.o
 MSmits: glad it is done
 MSmits: for a game with random&#160;!?
 jacek: there is particular opening discovered by td-gammon that humans thought it was bad but it was good
 Astrobytes: Presumably it's priority based moves by whatever values are rolled
 Scarfield: sure, good moves for different dice. 1-3, and 1-6 are considered the best starting dice.
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Murat_Eroglu: 5-6 is also good imo
 MSmits: sounds more like a strategy thing
 waterproofsodium: jacek kinda typical AI story you hear about professional level AI?
 Murat_Eroglu: or 6-6 if you start first
 j4at: backgammon is a solved games
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon#Advances_in_backgammon_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon#Advances_in_backgammon_theory</a>
 Razovsky: never played it
 Razovsky: am not brave enough
 MSmits: never thought about solving a game with random elements
 MSmits: seems difficult
 struct: I have no idea how to make an ai for this
 struct: besides ept(0)
 j4at: There is 32m possible positions so If you are planning add it to bot programming. Probably everyone will be able to perfectly solve it
 j4at: Write lookup table&#160;:"D
 struct: 32 seems low
 struct: 32m
 Scarfield: 32 is low yea&#160;:)
 MSmits: 32 million is really hard to fit in codesize
 Razovsky: i missed those discussions not gonna lie
 MSmits: impossible even without some compression
 MSmits: (and that's assuming 1 bit per result, maybe you'll need more)
 Wontonimo: compress it lol
 j4at: Well a lot of those positions will never be visited because they are bad
 jacek: 32m? wtf where did you get that number
 MSmits: says 10**20 here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity</a>

 jacek: "Hypergammon is a game in which players have only three counters on the board"
 Astrobytes: Hypergammon is a ga
 Astrobytes: beaten again&#160;:(
 j4at: ops stupid google
 Westicles: how does blaise get an alert every time people change names?
 MSmits: backgammon is similar to checkers in statespace complexity
 j4at: my bad&#160;:(
 MSmits: but it may be far harder to solve
 struct: just hack random
 struct: problem solved
 Westicles: he notices when I change name for taco shenanigans or if thib impersonates someone 
 MSmits: i have a question about platinum rift 2
 MSmits: if you own a zone, but you don't have vision from a pod, do you know you own it?
 MSmits: apparently you cant tell the difference between neutral and opponent zones if you dont have vision
 waterproofsodium: does someone know whether <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/stock-exchange-losses">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/stock-exchange-losses</a> can be solved in O(n)?
 MSmits: i solved it, let me check
 MSmits: yeah seems I(n)
 MSmits: O(n)
 MSmits: just 1 loop and some ifs
 MSmits: loop from 0 to n... so that seems like O(n)
 waterproofsodium: hm ty!
 MSmits: it's remarkably short too. I solved this in C# and i usually end up with 100-200 lines even for easy puzzles, but this one is 34 lines everything included
 waterproofsodium: I would think there are some cases that can't be solved in O(n)
 waterproofsodium: (unless with a more sophisticated algorithm than you describe)
 waterproofsodium: ..but I just started witht he problem, so it's a first guess
 MSmits: well once you realize how to do it, it's really simple
 waterproofsodium: hm ok let me ask that
 MSmits: just remember, if the price goes up, then either the worst possible sell-moment was just before that, or the greatest loss is somewhere else
 MSmits: so you reset the difference every time the price goes up
 waterproofsodium: if you start at "10", then go to a all time low of "0" then go up to "11" and then end at "10" would your algorithm detect output "10"?
 MSmits: yeah
 waterproofsodium: ok then I shall think about the O(n) solution :P
 waterproofsodium: ty
 struct: tbf this is a physics problem
 MSmits: not sure it would detect 10 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 9 -&gt; 0
 MSmits: because the greatest loss is 10 there
 MSmits: but it may think it's 9
 waterproofsodium: I mean if you find one case it doesn't detect it seems pointless for me to try find O(n) :D
 j4at: solved in python using 1 loop and 1 min and 1 max function calls
 MSmits: yeah i am trying to understand if mine does this correctly
 waterproofsodium: please let me know if it doesnt ^^
 MSmits: ohh right, i understand it now
 MSmits: it should take care of all cases
 waterproofsodium: nice
 MSmits: basically you have a start price and an end price. 
 MSmits: which gives the biggest loss
 waterproofsodium: oh ofc I think I got it&#160;:)
 MSmits: you first price is the first start price, then you keep going to try to find a lower and lower end price
 MSmits: and you record the largest difference. if you find a higher price than the start price, then that is the new start price
 MSmits: you can go though it linearly
 MSmits: normally I don't understand my 2 yr old code. This one is a nice solution&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: hm
 waterproofsodium: I wasn't asking for a solution. just for the info whether you can do it in O(n) :P
 waterproofsodium: but since we're at it:
 waterproofsodium: spoiler warning:
 MSmits: oh sorry if that spoiled it, I figured it was more about the coding
 waterproofsodium: np
 MSmits: will be more careful about this in the future 
 MSmits: I think I have gotten dumber in the last 2 yrs. Not sure if i would have figured it out if i saw this puzzle for the 1st time now :P
 waterproofsodium: maybe you mean this: but you just keep track of the latest max and the maximum difference
 waterproofsodium: *the last max
 MSmits: yeah i think so
 MSmits: that could be the same thing yeah, but it's all in the details
 MSmits: language is less precise than code
 MSmits: the latest max is just the max that you have found so far, going through the loop
 struct: I think I solved that problem on paper first
 struct: I think I did it like 4 years ago
 MSmits: i may have also, that's why it seems hard to me now, just looking at it and trying to figure it out without writing stuff down is hard
 MSmits: paper is so useful
 waterproofsodium: gg first try worked!
 waterproofsodium: :D
 MSmits: nice one&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: thx for help
 MSmits: np
 jacek: you waste so much paper eh
 waterproofsodium: I may have done this in O(n^2) whi9ch wold have been a waste :P
 MSmits: yeah, i waste a lot of paper writing down symmetry transformations of board games :0
 MSmits: nine mens morris is the worst of these
 MSmits: you cant write a simple function to transform them, or at least that seems hard. So I mapped all possibilities with arrays
 waterproofsodium: "language is less precise than code"seems like an exact statement :Pprobably a good reason to try get a better intuition with code since we all started with language
 MSmits: yea
 struct: ok I decided to make the dices myself
 jacek: you still have solved 9mm?
 MSmits: i did not finish solving the opening stage, but i solved the endgame completely (even 9x9)
 MSmits: i have the code for the openign game though
 MSmits: just got distracted
 MSmits: including the opening game, i'd need 40 GB to store it all. I'll do oware first
 MSmits: there's a free DB available written in c++ with hungarian comments if i remember correctly. I could not understand the code and their DB is bigger than it has to be.
 MSmits: (70+ GB)
 struct: Make sure to comment it in dutch
 MSmits: Yes, my revenge
 struct: Where is trictrac, he must play backgammon
 MSmits: is he still active?
 MSmits: or did CG run out of content for him?
 struct: He was last constest
 MSmits: ahh  ok
 MSmits: he consumes arena's faster than they appear
 struct: Maybe he already has a bot for every popular board game
 struct: just in case
 MSmits: yeah i think so
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trictrac">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trictrac</a>
 MSmits: ask him how his Janggi bot is next time you see him
 MSmits: this makes a lot of sense jacek
 MSmits: only a boardgame understands a boardgame
 struct: I should have ported a french game for free upvotes
 MSmits: gonna get some sleep. I hope to have some time to get a working pr2 bot tomorrow. Not going for top 10, just want a somewhat capable bot
 MSmits: as a learning exercise
 MSmits: gn

 blop200: just had a dsa exam today
 blop200: this website helped a lot 
 waterproofsodium: rip I may get downranked :fearful:
 BotCharles: I know next to nothing when it comes to coding. Should I continue using this site or learn the basics first?
 waterproofsodium: try if this site makes you learn something
 waterproofsodium: at one point it will show you your knowledge gaps
 blop200: I would advise learning basics first
 j4at: Learning a language a is boring, atleast for me. I prefer learning from practicing.You can use CodinGame to find your knowledge gap and to stimulate yourself to learn. But there is things that you can't learn here. So I will suggest doing it parallel play CodinGame and learn from other sources. But you should probably learn the basics first.
 j4at: this might help. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 Darleanow: BotCharles, u have a lot f
 Darleanow: of options, i've spammed clash of codes, while googling, it helped a lot to understand even some of the basics, (I've started from scratch too)
 Darleanow: U should do also projects
 Darleanow: for exmaple
 Darleanow: you can try to understand how strings, lists, numbers works
 Darleanow: try to print a few things
 Darleanow: then you can move on to some basic maths
 Darleanow: Where you will learn the most, will be the projects you do
 Darleanow: Get an idea, and then try to do it, using google as much as you want etc...
 Darleanow: But CG isnt the best platform to learn imma assume, it's more focused on training, and becoming better with knowledge you already have, programmiz is a simple website, that will allow you to learn C and Python
 Darleanow: The key is practice practice practice
 Darleanow: But don't forget theory&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: gg Whale
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey waterproofsodium, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 18 tacos
 waterproofsodium: gg
 waterproofsodium: I lost 3 points&#160;:(
 struct: you can get 3 points in a few minutes
 struct: just choose any multi
 waterproofsodium: I mean in clash
 waterproofsodium: trying to get better at it :D
 waterproofsodium: btw weird:
 waterproofsodium: I lost 3 points, but I gained 80 places!
 waterproofsodium: from 1613th to 1552nd
 waterproofsodium: :D
 waterproofsodium: which one is the real metric? the CP or the place?
 struct: I would say coding points
 waterproofsodium: yeah well none of them kinda
 keseng: can anyone tell me how to do the mean max
 waterproofsodium: since the data is not conclusive with that small sample size
 struct: mean max might be one of the hardest multis keseng
 keseng: I don't know how to count the tankers x y
 keseng: In Game Input they didn't in use
 struct: it should be given in the for loop
 struct: check unitType I guess
 waterproofsodium: personal goal: get to rank &lt; 500&#160;:)
 keseng: thank you
 struct: its not easy waterproofsodium
 waterproofsodium: def not
 waterproofsodium: but also not unrealistic :D
 struct: you might need to reach high rank in some multiplayers
 struct: yeah
 waterproofsodium: unless working with C# kills it, cause shortest code -.-
 waterproofsodium: oh na still just clash
 struct: ah top 500 in clash
 struct: ok
 waterproofsodium: still difficult tho? :P
 struct: I dont know
 waterproofsodium: after that I may focus more on overall score
 struct: Long time since I played clash
 Astrobytes: you have to play constantly to maintain that position
 waterproofsodium: nice. gonna do just that
 Astrobytes: because of the short decay time on the clash CP
 waterproofsodium: yeah I mean it's def a one time thing ig
 Astrobytes: lots of people just clash to maintain their rank, some do other  things alongside  but whatever floats your boat is best&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: def getting faster and more efficient floats my boat :P
 j4at: For shortest code learn python. I think that Python and C# are not that much different 
 j4at: waterproofsodium
 j4at: and you need only to learn the tricks
 j4at: no need to learn advanced concepts
 keseng: why I need to prove I'am not a robot 
 keseng: when I test the programe 
 molly.pears: lo

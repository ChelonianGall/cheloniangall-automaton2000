 gabevenberg: Ive never seen this in my python install. why is codinggame giving me invalid syntax: not in a function?
 jrke: whats the code?

 gabevenberg: tried putting some stuff in a function just incase codingame had some weird reqirements to put some logic in one, but nope.
 ProCoder03: the if condition has = 
 ProCoder03: should be ==
 gabevenberg: im an idot...
 ProCoder03: mistakes , happen
 gabevenberg: still gives the same error, on my def statement.
 ProCoder03: I tested it its working 
 jrke: which line the error is coming?
 gabevenberg: got it working, thnaks.
 GAME12CODER34: hhfhfhvhjb
 GAME12CODER34: hi
 ProCoder03: :wave:
 ProCoder03: gabevenberg, don't post the question both in discord and here in chat, please&#160;!!

 Mr_BlueBird: and 100+ Subscribers
 eulerscheZahl: no
 chinoto: @Mr_BlueBird Why would anyone bother to help a stranger with such a thing? Better to talk about how the viewer could benefit (eg, amusement, education) than how you will benefit.
 Westicles: blaise will be happy, potw
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, this will be a hard week for the rest of us
 <b>**eulerscheZahl saw a wall of text and a spotify link. And then immediately ran away</b></p><p><img src="/a/64869146225502" /> derjack: hm?
 derjack: what potw now
 derjack: oh, some puzzle :c
 eulerscheZahl: the blaise maze
 derjack: lets downvote it so it deletes
 Justin-Truong: could yo post the link of that puzzle

 Justin-Truong: thanks
 Justin-Truong: how to downvote it now it's a hard puzzle 
 eulerscheZahl: you don't just downvote a puzzle because its hard
 eulerscheZahl: that's toxic behaviour and shows to respect to the puzzle creator
 <b>**eulerscheZahl hates it to get 1 star reviews without even knowing why</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: creating a puzzle can be a lot of work
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yep

 eulerscheZahl: "Rotate the matrix"clockwise? counterclockwise?
 derjack: yes
 eulerscheZahl: for the downvotes: might be because the idea isn't very original<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=rotate&amp;category=ANY&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=rotate&amp;category=ANY&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but for clashes that's allowed
 TimothyAlexisVass: Is there a good way to check uniqueness of a clash?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Oh
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you
 derjack: yeah, by using tools provided by official CG staff ~
 Stilgart: TimothyAlexisVass: consider that clashes are never unique
 Stilgart: brainless, and more than 90% success
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: seems that you're in CG staff now&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: what is simulated annealing&#160;??
 ProCoder03: is it like GA&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: for a GA you have multiple solutions that you try to combine to a better oneSA has just 1 solution that you try to improve by applying minor modifications
 eulerscheZahl: staff? don't listen to jacek
 ProCoder03: Thanks eulerscheZahl

 Illedan: eulerscheZahl?
 Illedan: is your IDE codes gone too?
 Sundiver: mine is
 ProCoder03: yeah, the current language codes are gone in mine too.....
 Illedan: Staff is looking into it. 
 z19ma: Just when i solved my first 
 LorikKender: Good morning
 LorikKender: I have a little problem, when i enter any excescise, the code is empty
 Illedan: Devs are looking into it
 LorikKender: oh ok illedan
 LorikKender: srry i didnt read it 
 ESMAKING: hrello
 derjack: hri
 sirsatan: hey if i use time.perf_counter() in python  
 sirsatan: and subtract end of program and begining will i see true time of execution&#160;?
 sirsatan: in Night Of War i use it and i can  see sometimes 139 ms and max time for turn is 100ms
 eulerscheZahl: the start time should be taken after you read the first line of input (otherwise your timing includes the opponent and general server activity)
 sirsatan: oh 
 sirsatan: thank's eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: no problem, it's a common mistake
 derjack: ocassionally, you can use a little more time than 100ms, but its unreliable
 eulerscheZahl: except for code vs zombies
 eulerscheZahl: statement tells you 100ms but in reality you have 150
 sirsatan: you mean time debt :D
 eulerscheZahl: the server has some error margin on your time limit. but also measures unreliably itself
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes you can use 110ms without losing
 eulerscheZahl: other times you already lose below 100ms
 eulerscheZahl: a science on its own
 sirsatan: oh i thought the problem will be always in the favor of the player
 sirsatan: error*
 sirsatan: good to know

 BlaiseEbuth: Jon? Is it you?
 TheGhost98: hello
 Hoyer: Hm with C++ u can use the GCC pragmas to give extra boost for performance.. Is there anything similar we can/should do in Rust? I rewrote my c++ uttt bot in rust for experience and saw an unexpected reduction in amount of sims I got
 eulerscheZahl: rust has release mode on CG, no need for pragmas
 Hoyer: then it's annoying that I'm seeing less perf
 Hoyer: I'll go through my code I guess
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you suck at rust? :P
 Hoyer: could be
 Hoyer: but I made pointers work and everything, and I feel like it works pretty much like my c++ bot did
 Hoyer: maybe I missed something
 struct: maybe gcc does some optimizations that rust doesnt
 struct: and how much reduction are we talking about?

 jacek: hes not worth it

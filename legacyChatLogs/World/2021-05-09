 soouinteni: Hi, is there a way to go back and try to finish the clash of code challenge that just finished&#160;?
 DaNinja: try searching for it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 soouinteni: found it, thank you&#160;!
 DaNinja: :thumbsup:
 KCrown: is everyoen searching now?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: like search algorithms?
 KCrown: yes
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I'm just doing heuristics
 Donotalo: how far a tree can plant seed?
 UndercoverToad: depends on the size of the tree
 UndercoverToad: size X tree: X cells range
 Donotalo: thanks
 KCrown: thanks NotSureWhyThisWorks
 StyllyMyle: No matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const int' to 'std::hash&lt;int&gt;'
 StyllyMyle: wtf is this error for line
 StyllyMyle: size_t hashA = std::hash&lt;A&gt;(a);
 StyllyMyle: pretty sure its compiler dependent error
 actualCoderTrevor: StyllyMyle no idea but maybe try std::hash&lt;A&gt;{}(a);
 khalkhoul: hello
 MerryMentat: For C# folks: any pitfalls in using Stopwatch to measure time in order to break out early if you're running low on time?  I get timeouts in ~7% of my games, but I'm pretty sure I'm checking all over the place that I haven't used more than 75 ms.
 MerryMentat: Is there a recommended way to break out early?
 UndercoverToad: stopwatch is fine, that's all I can say.during the last contest there were some problems with random timeouts affecting everyone. I don't know if this is still the case
 Chainman: hey 
 Chainman: Can you run this game locally with the source code? 
 UndercoverToad: yes but you have to install maven
 Chainman: can you have the graphics too?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 Chainman: whoah, I really want to do that.
 Chainman: Are there instructions on how to do it with Maven?
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/how-to-run-ocean-of-code-github-project-locally/168041/3">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/how-to-run-ocean-of-code-github-project-locally/168041/3</a>
 Chainman: thanks, I'll try it
 UndercoverToad: with the IntelliJ IDE it's pretty straight forward (import project from existing sources =&gt; maven project)
 UndercoverToad: i succeeded with eclipse as well
 Chainman: I have vscode 
 UndercoverToad: i suppose there is a plugin to do the job, never tried
 Chainman: I've never done java program in vscode, going to check out.
 Chainman: I used to do it in intellij
 Str4ngeL00p: When should one start the timer to avoid timeouts, after reading all the input from stdin or before?
 jacek: id say after reading first input
 ashiknur: how many line of code you have written in this challenge?mine - 480 line
 Thienu: 500 right now
 actualCoderTrevor: 440 including blanks and the starter code
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: 300 but its python
 Zenoscave: Is a beam width of 100 too narrow for good results? Should I try to get a better eval or beam width at that point
 jrke: not sure if its narrow but its not enough also it depends on your pruning and good eval
 Zenoscave: Then my eval is trash lol
 dbdr: with a better eval, you need less width, and conversely&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 dbdr: so improving either can be useful
 Zenoscave: Man I always suck at eval
 jrke: and i always suck at optimization
 Thienu: man why did i think board indices would fit into 5 bits
 Thienu: whoops
 Zenoscave: need to figure out a way to spread my seed placements. They all cluster and I shodow a lot
 jrke: goods know what will be the opening window for silver
 jrke: last time 3000 bronzies and 750 opening of silver this time .....
 dbdr: a good eval in this game is not easy
 jrke: yeah what all you need - shadow, more trees, sunpoints, major - score
 jacek: then use NN [solved]
 avdg: Aggressive bots may have an easier time to win though
 avdg: So there will be more like level layers
 dbdr: define aggressive
 dbdr: in points, space, ...?
 avdg: take away opponents opportunities
 ashiknur: this is the main key point of this game
 avdg: so to climb, one must be prepared to squash these posibilities
 jacek: thats the point of most games
 Kellthazar: My algorithm just did some list ordering based on game state and that was sufficient to put me under the 400th rank... o.o
 kovi: very nice dbdr
 dbdr: thanks!
 dbdr: new feature, and I just realized there is a bug in it
 dbdr: but I'll let it run before fixing it
 dbdr: probably better with the bug anyways&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: calssic
 UndercoverToad: classic
 NinjaDoggy: dbdr nice!
 UndercoverToad: nice score, you make me yealous
 jacek: yeet
 VizGhar: I'm not sure how to debug these searches
 UndercoverToad: don't code bugs [solved]
 NinjaDoggy: any language can win this contest because it's all about eval :joy:
 kovi: and maybe that is the first which cannot be reached by heuristics only
 UndercoverToad: finally I beat that struct \o/
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Undercover rofl
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: shadows affect start of the day?
 UndercoverToad: chat is browser-crashing laggy for moderators when that many users are online&#160;:(
 jacek: only*
 Marchete: good morning fellow coders
 VizGhar: morning machette :P
 UndercoverToad: moin
 UndercoverToad: oh i shouldn't say that, I might have blown my cover
 Marchete: :spy:
 jacek: Automaton2000 what cover
 Automaton2000: or is there a faster way to check if a player is sent to a board that is either already ...
 ashiknur: dbdr submitted again guess what point he will earn in this submission
 UndercoverToad: he fixed a bug
 Marchete: fixed a bug == 3 positions down
 VizGhar: ++
 dbdr: :scream:
 Marchete: you all improved a lot in 1 day
 Marchete: :d
 Marchete: :D
 dbdr: damn, fixing the bug does not seem to hurt that much :o
 dbdr: Where are the snows of yesteryear?
 Marchete: you only lost 2 games
 Marchete: no 3
 Marchete: it's hard with that few matches
 Marchete: unless you tested locally
 dbdr: no local testing
 VizGhar: hmm how do I write comparation function for n-th element against vector of some structures?
 VizGhar: bool compare(Node, Node) doesn't seem to work
 DaNinja: bool cmp_node(const Node&amp; a, const Node&amp; b) { return a.score &lt; b.score; }
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f61d6ef7-fc50-44d8-b377-7b45f81804c7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f61d6ef7-fc50-44d8-b377-7b45f81804c7</a>
 VizGhar: tnx
 jacek: oh could use &amp; there
 VizGhar: this is only place where I can get answers faster then googling
 Numby: It seems that reading input (java) is taking a significant time (~5000ms). I
 VizGhar: hmm for beam search I should cut the nodes only after I finish whole depth right?
 VizGhar: Numby it should not take that much
 VizGhar: where did you get that number?
 Numby: Well, it's not causing a timeout
 Numby: Timing it with System.currentTimeMillis
 DaNinja: strart timer after first input
 DaNinja: *start
 VizGhar: then the number wont be correct... timeout for first turn is 1000ms
 VizGhar: Do like ninja said
 dreadylein: @Numby if you measure time after sending your command you will measure the whole enemy turn also
 jacek: still System.currentTimeMillis would not give 5000ms
 Numby: Making the corrections mentioned, one sec
 VizGhar: He probably knows how to measure time jacek&#160;:) he just don't know when to start and end timer
 VizGhar: this nth_element is neat
 Marchete: what's the use on nth_element?
 Marchete: of*
 VizGhar: it does one iteration of quick sort with pivot on nth element
 VizGhar: so everything on left is smaller and everything on right is larger (or what you define in compare function)
 Numby: Hmm, I'm now setting start time after reading the first input each turn (the day), and setting end time after I've finished getting the input. Still shows 4000ms
 Marchete: I mean specific real use
 VizGhar: beam search - you need to cut worse items
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: true
 VizGhar: I was sorting the whole list previously
 VizGhar: was thinking about implementing some weighted tree, but nah
 Numby: Hmm, I timed the vanilla starter code and it only takes 0~1ms so def something off with my actual code that reads the input
 jacek: try chocolate starter code
 VizGhar: :D you are instantiating some objects there that calls some expensive methods right?
 VizGhar: he made it chocolate obviously 
 Numby: I didn't think I was doing anything expensive but time to debug now :D
 Numby: Yeah double chocolate with fudge on top
 Marchete: :icecream:
 VizGhar: I'm allergic to chocolate&#160;:(
 VizGhar: chocolate coffee and apples... people always think I'm kidding
 Marchete: and bullets
 VizGhar: well... depends on how you define allergy, but yes... those can kill me too
 Tiramon: damn found the error in my sim ... i didn't remove the dormant status on day change ...
 dreadylein: :D
 Marchete: I've seen worse
 kovi: seen same
 Tiramon: but atleast that explains why my sim doesn't  result in anything good&#160;:)
 Astrolynix: this is my first time trying to code (not really) so i wont be suprised if i lose
 Marchete: don't you test against yourself on CG IDE to validate it?
 Marchete: 1st validation should be play prefixed moves
 Marchete: and check possible moves given in stdin vs calculated
 Tiramon: i thought my code should work like this, build the algo and as there are no good results i currently build testcases to locate the error
 Tiramon: and given moves always fit my list of generated .. there is no dormant change in between&#160;;)
 Marchete: also endgames are tricky
 jacek: hm?
 Marchete: sometimes the scoring at turn 200 it's different to what you expected
 jacek: turn 200?
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: last day
 Marchete: 24
 Marchete: in this case
 Marchete: I don't refer at this game in particular
 Marchete: but in general about how your sim behaves on last turn
 Marchete: and what the referee does
 Marchete: tldt: oware
 Marchete: oware was tricky to have the right scoring at endgame
 jacek: oh
 emh: what's gonna be Silver cutoff? am I safe around ~1k?
 Marchete: found it by testing on CG IDE
 Marchete: 4400 in bronze
 Marchete: you should be
 emh: cool. thanks&#160;:)
 Marchete: you can also try some basic eval of possible moves
 Marchete: I did and got like 150th
 emh: wow nice
 emh: I have  a 102 line program
 emh: with some sort and if
 Marchete: I have more
 emh: I heard bitboarding is popular
 emh: so might do that after Silver
 emh: if I have the energy
 emh: hehe
 Marchete: low coding time?
 Marchete: go full heuristics
 emh: nooo
 emh: low energy
 Marchete: the same
 Marchete: if you have low motivation
 Marchete: maybe with some evals you can do the trick
 emh: I'm gonna work 2-3 hours per day next week. at the real work
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: bitboarding can be time consuming
 emh: so I have plenty time left for contest, just don't know how much energy gonna be left
 Marchete: but if you are fast in 1 day you have it
 emh: ok hehe
 Marchete: I'd need like 6 :D
 emh: thought u were xpert in bits
 emh: didn't u AVX2 and so on?
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: but little AVX2 right now
 Marchete: a bit for shadows
 Marchete: not much more
 emh: hmm ok. so you already using AVX2 for shadow in this game? wow. it's already surprising
 Marchete: not like something super cool
 Marchete: i have trees 0-4 on avx2
 Marchete: and it applies some shifts for shadowing
 Marchete: imo it should improve a lot
 Marchete: shouldn't
 StyllyMyle: So
 StyllyMyle: is there any memory limit?
 StyllyMyle: im kinda storing some 36 pairs of xyz coordinates
 dreadylein: ~800mb iirc
 StyllyMyle: kinda worried maybe if there would be any limit
 StyllyMyle: Ok
 Saoirseacht: New to this what is a good place to start like what lang?
 DaNinja: C++, Python or Javascript
 Tiramon: totally depends what language you are comfortable with
 Marchete: python C#
 Marchete: c++ is ugly
 UndercoverToad: asking for a language to start with always results in highly different answers depending on who sees the question first
 geppoz: (I find python ugliest, matter of taste&#160;;) )
 UndercoverToad: maybe tell us what you want to achieve (solving puzzles, writing desktop applications, a website, ..)
 geppoz: (talking just estetically)
 geppoz: Saoirseacht the question is like: "should I use spoon, fork or knife?"&#160;:) hard to eat a steak with spoon or soup with fork
 UndercoverToad: i like that comparison
 geppoz: or, as once a colleague of mine told me, "well, maybe you will success to comb your hair with a hammer, but it will hurt" :D
 geppoz: he is russian, btw :D
 UndercoverToad: or manipulate a string with C for the matter
 geppoz: anyway, if you really need an answer I would say go for JS, it is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31ykMLfXBbL._AC_.jpg">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31ykMLfXBbL._AC_.jpg</a>
 geppoz: (if you are an absolute beginner and you want to see some result very soon)
 UndercoverToad: JS :scream:
 geppoz: sad to say so mate
 geppoz: speaking is someone that started with assembler, cpp, then years of java
 geppoz: just few years ago started use js
 geppoz: and now I reccomend it for starters
 geppoz: (but i use c++ :D )
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: what does the score mean on the leaderboard?
 UndercoverToad: "Trueskill" is the word that you and soon the search engine of your trust are looking for
 geppoz: well speaking of c++
 geppoz: just wasted an hour on a really weird beviour
 geppoz:  while (depth&lt;maxDepth){
 geppoz: ... depth++ ...
 geppoz: }
 geppoz: I saw in log printd depth&gt;maxDepth and never exited
 geppoz: solution: remove #pragma GCC optimize("-Ofast", "-ffast-math")
 geppoz: with that pragma seems the condition was not evaluated anymore :scream:
 Twelve0: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-spring-challenge-2020/152927">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-spring-challenge-2020/152927</a>formula to compute points for a player counting for their school or company&#160;:10 000^((N- C+ 1)/ N)guys can you please explain what N and C stand for in this formula
 CGGCoder: N should be the number of players and C should be your rank?
 CGGCoder: Maybe the opposite
 jrke: N total players, C = your rank
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: what is score in the leaderboard?
 jrke: basis of evaluating rank
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: how is it calculated?
 Twelve0: thank you 
 jrke: trueskill NotSureWhyThisWorks
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh sorry I didn't see undercoverToads message
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: thx
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: wow there is a gap of around 3 between rank 1 and 2
 Michael_Howard: Do you go up/down in leaderboard for drawing against higher/lower ranked opponents? (The TrueSkill definition I found didn't mention draws)
 jrke: lol my sunpoints - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/549941349">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/549941349</a>
 jrke: due to sim eval
 DetoBot: yeah you were special this time
 DetoBot: :joy:
 kovi: script solutions are getting pushed back...but i wonder how many of c++ solutions are heuristic based?
 actualCoderTrevor: It finally happened :D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549948690">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549948690</a>
 ShannonNorris97: Can seeds plant other seeds?
 DevLorenzo: Which is the easiest bot game?
 DetoBot: tic tac toe
 DetoBot: maybe rock papers scissors
 DetoBot: :rolling_eyes:
 DetoBot: Seeds can't plant other seeeds
 DevLorenzo: thx
 DetoBot: they haven't grown up yet :sweat_smile:
 Tiramon: seeds would have a range of 0 (size) to plant new seeds ... that won't work&#160;;)
 ShannonNorris97: Oh yeah I forgot that was the seed planting range - thank you
 DetoBot: Well was the exact answer
 DetoBot: :grinning:
 UndercoverToad: oh, I drifted into top10 over lunch :ostop the contest!
 synchoz: how do i calculate the range of avaible seed to plant i cant seem to understand when i am at 34 and i can seed size of 1 which is 34-1 or 34+1 or 34/2 but if its 20 then it goes like +1 -1 and -12 
 UndercoverToad: look at the map
 UndercoverToad: show the IDs using the :gear:
 UndercoverToad: the gear doesn't show up properly in chat&#160;:/just go to viewer settings
 synchoz: hmmm ok :o 
 UndercoverToad: debug: on
 UndercoverToad: 34 is the bottom right tile
 UndercoverToad: neighbors (range 1) are 33, 35, 17
 UndercoverToad: for 20 it's 7,8,19,21
 synchoz: ooh nice i didnt know about the debug on XD 
 UndercoverToad: 3rd item under " Debugging tips"
 synchoz: thx
 emh: terrible morning. ok having another quadruple espresso
 emh: in the form of iced coffee with milk
 emh: lactose free
 abobas: When is silver coming online?
 struct: tomorrow
 abobas: cool thnx
 CGGCoder: rip
 Donald_D._Doge: hi, new here, when is silver coming out?
 CGGCoder: Monday, the 10th of May 2021
 CGGCoder: AKA Tomorrow
 UndercoverToad: as answered 3 messages above already
 CGGCoder: Lol
 Michael_Howard: Tomorrow it'll be what time does it open.
 UndercoverToad: 6pm CEST
 UndercoverToad: so in 1 days 5h
 kovi: got you dbdr&#160;:)
 kovi: (for once)
 UndercoverToad: but I got you. So did I get dbd r?
 kovi: you are usually winning vs. me today
 geppoz: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 geppoz: nextDest-&gt;trees[i]|0x80;
 geppoz: another hour gone
 geppoz: :D
 CGGCoder: On Bronze, I beat the boss my growing a tree then waiting
 CGGCoder: by*
 UndercoverToad: i don't see what's wrong there geppoz
 geppoz: me too
 geppoz: for 1 hour
 CGGCoder: what does that do?
 geppoz: look better
 UndercoverToad: ()|0x80?
 CGGCoder: Yeh
 geppoz: it is supposed to add a mask bit
 UndercoverToad: i think i need more context to understand what's wrong with this
 UndercoverToad: wait, that's the whole line?
 geppoz: yes
 UndercoverToad: not assigning the result?
 geppoz: yes&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: we all made this mistakes
 geppoz: miss the "=" in the middle
 UndercoverToad: in the ghost in the cell contest here on CG I had a function to sort something and return a sorted result
 UndercoverToad: I created a new, sorted list and somehow thought I was modifying it in-place
 UndercoverToad: my #6 contest but had a crucial bug&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: could have been even higher without :sob:
 geppoz: so you never used the result, nice
 UndercoverToad: and debugged it several times but didn't see the error in the function
 UndercoverToad: as it was all fine inside
 SingleMan: ayo
 geppoz: it should have been a very special thing if everything after worked fine even using an unsorted array supposing it to be sorted :thinking:
 SingleMan: :rage:
 SingleMan: hahahhahahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahhahaahhahahahahhahahahaha
 UndercoverToad: it was for finding which factory to upgrade
 UndercoverToad: and sometimes i didn't upgrade at all because of this
 Beerus: quick question: changes on trees are applied at the end of the day? (except the isDormant state)
 Beerus: changes on sizes,  new trees added
 kovi: no, they are instant
 Beerus: so you plant two seeds at the same day and the cost of second is higher than the 1st?
 KelvinAndHubbles: yes
 KelvinAndHubbles: you plant them the same day, but not the same turn
 Beerus: se the tree grows instantly?
 CodeDiller: Hello everybody!
 CodeDiller: Appreciate my contribution:)
 CodeDiller: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6682aaf148072ac60d30b0d86e4b79755e56">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6682aaf148072ac60d30b0d86e4b79755e56</a>
 Beerus: it would make sense if it grows at the end of day
 KelvinAndHubbles: no, if you grow a tree it instantly grows, of course because it grows it become dorment so it can't do much for the rest of the day
 Beerus: of course it can become dormant bu the grow can be applied at the end of the day, it makes more sense
 Beerus: to me
 geppoz: Beerus I suppose that only matters in calc of grow costs (and seed)&#160;?
 Beerus: yes
 KelvinAndHubbles: yep, but it also negatively affects grow costs of it's own layer, part of the strategy is growing trees so that growing other trees to the initial trees previous layer cost less in the same turn
 KelvinAndHubbles: Common example: Promoting seed to 1st tree because sending out a seed without any other seeds is free
 KelvinAndHubbles: although, I will say you version could work aswell, just it's not completlty how they decided to make the challenge  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Beerus: ok got it
 Beerus: it's easier for coding to apply the changes instantly 
 geppoz: well "you version could work aswell" I think not
 geppoz: if he doesn't correct this calc, he can thing he can seed or grow when he really can't
 KelvinAndHubbles: I meant that if they programmed the contest like that it probably wouldn't be too differentiated, but if he makes his bot around it with this specific rules it'd be worse
 AntiSquid: reached limit of plays @_@
 UndercoverToad: they changed the test-play limits
 Astrobytes: It's extremely annoying
 ShannonNorris97: Just to check I'm interpreting this right - the cost of planting a new seed is equal to the number of seeds already in play. So, if I have all size 1 trees and no seeds, planting a new seed is free?
 AntiSquid: it's extremely low ... they should have just restricted the abuser accounts 
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I was questioning my sanity the other day. "Surely I haven't presses 'Play' that much :thinking: "
 Astrobytes: *predsed
 Astrobytes: *PRESSED
 AntiSquid: it's all the benchmarkers @_@
 UndercoverToad: i'm innocent, not using online benchmarks
 Astrobytes: Been quite some time since I bothered doing that
 Necabo: Hi
 Aurelien-Quillet: Hi all, is it possible to look up (or filter) all puzzles that belong to several categories: loops and conditions and 2d-arrays (for instance)&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: you can click the tags
 Necabo: how do i join very easy clash of codes?
 Astrobytes: Leave the hard ones.
 Necabo: How do I know which one is hard
 UndercoverToad: you can't influence the difficulty
 UndercoverToad: you can detect the hard ones when you don't know how to solve them
 Necabo: It says on the quest 'the difficulty ranges from very easy to medium'
 Necabo: So i just keep joining until an easy one appears?
 UndercoverToad: you can ignore the text on the quest map
 Necabo: I see&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: just play or win X clashes to complete the quest
 Necabo: sorry
 Astrobytes: Or don't.
 UndercoverToad: play the contest instead
 Necabo: Astrobytes I am sorry
 UndercoverToad: 5000 users have joined already, started on Thursday
 UndercoverToad: still a full week to go
 Astrobytes: No need to apologise.
 UndercoverToad: these submits are crawling up the leaderboard at snail speed, I want silver&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: 75% done and still climbing
 Astrobytes: I think you're safe for silver
 UndercoverToad: would be a fun silver if not
 GeraltOfRivia: 🙂
 UndercoverToad: i was in silver already
 UndercoverToad: on Thursday
 Astrobytes: lol, weren't we all&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: some remained in wood
 Astrobytes: Ah.
 OcularBear8: facepalm
 Tiramon: hm 850 turns simulated ... that sounds good still the result is crap
 Tiramon: *850k
 Marchete: I'm saving energy by not using simulations
 UndercoverToad: that sounds too good
 OcularBear8: i got a coc trying to find tha last angle of a triangle using 2 angles and i programmed the entire pythagorean theorem in there
 OcularBear8: whoops
 UndercoverToad: 180-alpha-beta?
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Yeah, like when I had millions upon millions of sims one time then realised I never actually called the sim
 UndercoverToad: finally got you struct
 Astrobytes: hi struct
 UndercoverToad: this morning
 struct: 850k is feasible yeah
 struct: grats
 Numby: damn i'm doin only a few hundred sims in the earlier turns and at most few thousand later
 Numby: gotta get those numbers way up
 struct: I havent benched mine
 Tiramon: hm damn not 850k .. just forgot to reset the counter ... arg
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: wtf is this map
 Marchete: 850 again
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ZFIJtwH.png">https://i.imgur.com/ZFIJtwH.png</a>
 AntiSquid: i like it
 struct: seed=-1896067115874585600
 MindController: Is the first turn that we get 1000ms only  input of cells, or cells + 1 turn of normal game?
 Tiramon: hm atleast still around 20k turns
 Tiramon: 1st turn wit 1s = til first output
 Tiramon: *with
 struct: I need to find a good low depth eval
 geppoz: problem is depth 3 I have created 380k game states
 geppoz: and it is hard to prune in so low depth
 llllllllll: python at 16th place. What?!
 struct: did he submit a worse version?
 struct: he was top 3
 llllllllll: how the heck
 llllllllll: it must be heuristics, not sim
 Astrobytes: I think competition got stronger struct
 llllllllll: I spend 95% of my time in copying my game states
 struct: how big is your state?
 JBM: about 500 000 km2
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 llllllllll: probably way too big. Trees, sun, nutrient value, etc
 llllllllll: basically everything except the map itself
 llllllllll: copy.deepcopy takes forever&#160;:'( 
 struct: which language?
 struct: ah py3
 llllllllll: py3
 llllllllll: time to switch to C++But I wonder how the python guys reached that high
 Astrobytes: Clever heuristics.
 llllllllll: yeah, I guess so
 Astrobytes: iirc oi oi said no search the other day
 geppoz: my state is 64 bytes, I prefer to keep some precalc info
 DocDave: json.decode(json.encode(state))&#160;;)
 llllllllll: meh, thats basically the same as deepcopy when used on dicts, etc, isn't it?
 Tiramon: my extrem simple first day heuristic ist still at 308 ... far better than expected
 struct: my bot fell to 86th&#160;:'(
 Tiramon: will you try to improve it?
 struct: yeah
 UndercoverToad: legend or delete
 Astrobytes: But you have to wait until the last night of the contest
 itzluku: how do u guys upgrade money efficient&#160;?
 geppoz: money=sun points?
 UndercoverToad: no, google play cards
 itzluku: yes
 itzluku: like, whats your heuristic approach on deciding when and what to upgrade
 itzluku: to maximize suns over time
 Edo1999: hi

 NEW123Programmer: in JS..
 Homicidal_Genius: ill be honest, ive never coded properly outside of high school, trying to learn... 
 Homicidal_Genius: with a few code fixes from a friend, ive somehow managed to climb to wood 3 in the pod racing game haha.
 Murat_Eroglu: how do you find neighboors from distance?
 ddreams: I precalculate them on startup
 peerdb: do you guys know what time silver opens tomorrow?
 ddreams: use the given neighbors to find 2nd neighbors etc
 DaNinja: click Bronze League at the top to see what time the next league opens
 DaNinja: 6pm CEST
 AntiSquid: so much work to barely beat my if-else bot T_T
 itzluku: my smarter version is worse now
 GibbonThatCodes: my if else bot that I wrote at the very start is still top 500 somehow, I really dont know if I can be bothered to put more complex effort in, im very lazy
 itzluku: &gt;50 score to 48 sth
 itzluku: xD
 UndercoverToad: struct you ruined my submit&#160;:(
 struct: sorry&#160;:(
 itzluku: wait so silver doesnt even open on money for most eu
 UndercoverToad: it does
 itzluku: monday*
 UndercoverToad: CEST = central European summer time
 itzluku: 1am 11.05&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: it's 6pm for you as well, we live in the same timezone
 itzluku: ah cest
 itzluku: thought cst
 itzluku: was like wtf
 UndercoverToad: what even is cst?
 UndercoverToad: christian summer time?
 itzluku: Central Standard Time
 itzluku: usa 
 Astrobytes: Corduroy Support Tights?
 Astrobytes: "Christian summer time" I like that
 itzluku: :clown:
 itzluku: thats a weird clown
 Astrobytes: Have you ever seen a non-weird clown? :P
 AlMualem: Can someone please teel how do you promote from bronze to silver?i see no boss here
 AlMualem: tell me*
 UndercoverToad: silver opens tomorrow
 peerdb: Wait till tomorrow for silver league
 UndercoverToad: in 1 day 2 hours
 Astrobytes: click on Bronze League at the top
 AlMualem: oh ...i see&#160;:) thanks guys
 UndercoverToad: the "teaching how to fish instead of giving a fish" approach, astro?
 Astrobytes: Yes, exactly
 peerdb: tbh when I click on Bronze league at the top, I cant see the time it opens, just the date
 UndercoverToad: the time is just our experience from previous contests
 UndercoverToad: it's always about the same time of the day
 Astrobytes: Sometimes they open earlier or later, but not usually.
 UndercoverToad: with a few minutes variation, league opening is a manual process
 UndercoverToad: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: the future is here!!
 itzluku: so tomorrow u will be able to play against all the bots to get master&#160;?
 itzluku: or another time barrier
 AntiSquid: master&#160;?
 peerdb: no just to silver
 itzluku: legend
 peerdb: gold opens later, and legend probably saturday
 itzluku: whatever
 UndercoverToad: gold on wednesday, legend on friday
 itzluku:&#160;:/
 itzluku: i think the silver boss will be ez
 UndercoverToad: silver is always easy
 AntiSquid: silver boss wednesday
 UndercoverToad: legend is sometimes hardcore
 UndercoverToad: gold still doable if you know how to code
 struct: ill need to improve my bot a lot for legend
 itzluku: what happens if u beat the legend boss?
 UndercoverToad: there is no legend boss
 struct: Might aswell just delete nnow and end the pain
 AntiSquid: legend boss is 1st player you win a prize :P
 AntiSquid: bye struct was nice to know you, can i have your bots please?
 I_am_new: hi
 Donald_D._Doge: hi I_am_new, are you also new&#160;?
 struct: sure
 AntiSquid: lol why delete?
 itzluku: hi I_am_new, are you also new&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: i'M close to new, registered yesterday
 Necabo: Hi how do you complete several squares at once
 geppoz: silly question: if one seed in same spot where the other complete (in same turn), what happens?
 StyllyMyle: Guys
 UndercoverToad: both trees get dormant, no seed placed
 UndercoverToad: and no suns paid
 geppoz: no no
 UndercoverToad: yes yes
 UndercoverToad: check the statemetn
 geppoz: I mean, one COMPLETE and one SEED
 StyllyMyle: geppoz i think you can seed immedietly after the other used his two moves
 geppoz: not both SEED
 UndercoverToad: SEED is not a valid action as long as there is still a tree on that cell
 UndercoverToad: will this be a leadership change?
 geppoz: so who SEED receive an invalid mov
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: and invalid = WAIT (end day)
 MindController: Question: if u first complete tree, can u plant seed on that cell the same day?
 struct: yes
 Tiramon: hm as soon as i interpret complete correctly the bot wins against default ... must be coincidence
 StyllyMyle: So is it wise to have different algorithm for like stat, midd, and end of game?
 StyllyMyle: i think it would be better that way
 StyllyMyle: like in start i want expanding phase, then in mid something else
 StyllyMyle: but not sure how effective and scalable that approach is for future leagues
 KelvinAndHubbles: I mean, the start few rounds could probably be hard coded to a somewhat optimal solution, but multiple algs seems like a lot of work
 StyllyMyle: Hmm
 StyllyMyle: pretty much
 Lyan06: wait sorry for interruption, what is this 
 KelvinAndHubbles: what is what?
 Lyan06: this chat thingy
 KelvinAndHubbles: it's a place to chat with other people on Codingame
 StyllyMyle: but aint hardcoding not that good either? what if we get very diffrent start in high leagues
 KelvinAndHubbles: thought they said the rules were constant past Bronze except maybe balance tweaking?
 StyllyMyle: Lyan06 welcome to chat budd, this is one of my most favourite place
 StyllyMyle: Hmmmm
 StyllyMyle: Okk i gotta change my algo a bit
 drnobody: Hey, code says neighbors spiral out from center... I'm assuming clockwise, but what direction is first neighbor?
 orangesnowfox: probably east
 orangesnowfox: ("right")
 orangesnowfox: Oh, there's a bit of text for it
 drnobody: where?
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=61694161023285">https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=61694161023285</a>
 drnobody: ty
 orangesnowfox: In the forest section of the statement
 Queuebee: if I manage to get '7000 calls to minimax' in my 100ms, is that anywhere near good?
 drnobody: ah, so east then wittershins...cool, ty
 KelvinAndHubbles: well it's  a bit weird, the second spiral starts two east of initial index and not east of 6 index
 orangesnowfox: Well... Queuebee, What happens in those 7000 calls, what language? What does 7000 calls *mean*?
 drnobody: a big phone bill?
 Queuebee: I'm trying to learn c# coming from python lol..the minimax copies the whole gamestate N times based on the amount of possible moves :joy: and then keeps doing minimax on those states until depth=3 or gameover is reached  
 drnobody: old-school
 drnobody: As long as it's not taking forever I don;t see the problem. If it's taking too long to calculate, try an estimation/assumption that pairs it down from 7k, like ...what if I only minmax the ones closest to center, etc...
 Queuebee: well depth=3 my code runs, depth=4 it doesn't anymore because of too many calls
 Queuebee: the most calls I make before it crashes is around 7-8k calls
 drnobody: the number of calls and time is probably irrelevant. You want to maximize points.
 drnobody: that's what I mean
 drnobody: if you are making too many calle, try an assumption to force that number down
 Queuebee: do I put that assumtion in the minimax func or when generating moves
 drnobody: that's a design decision
 Queuebee: okay :D I'll try
 Queuebee: thanks 
 drnobody: I would put it before your initial calls to minmax
 drnobody: because it sounds recursive
 Queuebee: yes it is
 drnobody: but during minmax things can change that modify your assumption.
 drnobody: so like I said, design decision
 Queuebee: it's based on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/l-hh51ncgDI?t=613">https://youtu.be/l-hh51ncgDI?t=613</a>
 drnobody: not gonna click on links in here holmz
 Queuebee: Oh sorry uhm
 drnobody: your method is sound
 Necabo: sound as a pound
 drnobody: go with it, just pair down your iterations with logical assumptions
 Queuebee: I'll try my best 
 Necabo: good lad
 drnobody: Please don't that'll make it a little difficult for the rest of us. How about putting forward a mediocre effort..kewl?
 drnobody:&#160;;)
 Queuebee: :joy: I just want to reach silver
 drnobody: that will be difficult, doesn't exist yet.
 drnobody: as far as I know
 Queuebee: when it opens :D
 drnobody: aye
 VincentHch: hey guys, I'm in c++ and I have between 20 and 60ms just for receiving inputs... I then have 1 microsecond for generating every actions, but I feel like these milliseconds are huge, do you have the same magnitude&#160;?
 struct: when do you start your timer?
 drnobody: I am still just starting, but is it possible you are creating a bunch of objects that don't need to be memory resident while you are parsing input? Maybe you could streamline some logic without creating objects?
 drnobody: just spitballin
 CGGCoder: probably but it seems a bit complicated
 Str4ngeL00p: @VincentHch I think you need to be careful about how you pull the input from stdin. Reading from stdin is a blocking operation.
 KelvinAndHubbles: ouch, made beam search and instead of sorting to look for the best have been sorting and looking for the worst action to play every round lmao
 VincentHch: I start the timer at the start of my turn, I get every inputs and store it in a Game object, and stop the timer. The thing is that even if I'm creating huge objects (I don't think I do but we never know), 50 ms is huge so I wonder if this could come from slow stdin reading
 struct: you need to start your timer after reading first input

 itzluku: 20**(24*7) states for a sim  how accurate is that estimate?
 itzluku: u cant make that is 100ms right?
 struct: ofc not
 itzluku: how deep can u go tho
 itzluku: how many turns/days
 struct: I dont know
 struct: I can play 1Mill turns+
 itzluku: oof
 itzluku: 20**(24*7) 
 itzluku: is that accurate
 itzluku: in theory
 struct: 3.7414441915671114706e+218?
 itzluku: yup
 Queuebee: 1m+ :drooling_face:
 itzluku: that isnt even max
 StyllyMyle: So you can play any number of turns as long as you still have something
 CGGCoder: lol
 StyllyMyle: some actions r8?
 itzluku: some
 itzluku: but i might messed it up
 itzluku: thats why i ask
 CGGCoder:  when you know that beats the number of possible combinations of the 3x3 Rubik's Cube
 VincentHch: @struct Thanks, I have dozens of microseconds now which is way better :sweat_smile:
 StyllyMyle: LAOLZ
 itzluku: i estimate 20 options per turn since  there are max 37 unique and they are prob split 50/50
 struct: np
 struct: max is not 37
 itzluku: but there are only 37 cells
 CGGCoder: Is it wrong that me doing nothing is going strong on Bronze?
 struct: well you can seed
 struct: And seed from different trees
 itzluku: u cant grow or complete a seed option and u cant grow a complete option
 CGGCoder: Yeah but I'm doing nothing
 itzluku: u cant complete a seed or grow option
 itzluku: yeh but seed from different trees is useless
 struct: its not
 itzluku: why
 itzluku: oh
 itzluku: wait
 itzluku: the tree that throws the seed gets dormant?
 itzluku: fuck
 CGGCoder: lol
 itzluku: never thought about that
 CGGCoder: I guess it's like giving birth?
 itzluku: xD
 CGGCoder: You need a cooldown
 StyllyMyle: tbh i can understand almost everything given in this game
 StyllyMyle: but couldnt see what gamebreaking would be if there isnt something like dormant
 StyllyMyle: cooldwon
 StyllyMyle: cooldown
 itzluku: yeh u can prob compare a human giving birth with a tree dropping 1million potential trees
 itzluku: xD
 StyllyMyle: Laol
 itzluku: dormant makes it easier to succed with heuristics
 itzluku: because it simplifies
 itzluku: my guess
 CGGCoder: lol
 Wontonimo: hey hey ... i haven't been on since yesterday.  Are there a bunch of simulation bots now?
 itzluku: idk
 CGGCoder: Imagine just seeing the tree in the middle giving birth to 30 seeds all around the map
 Wontonimo: that would take 30 days
 itzluku: if dormant wasnt a thing
 CGGCoder: If there was no dormant state and the sun points are enought
 CGGCoder: enough*
 Wontonimo: WOW mind blown
 itzluku: O_0
 Wontonimo: lol
 itzluku: (Y)
 StyllyMyle: Now i see
 CGGCoder: The opponent: 'The heck is this? OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT'
 StyllyMyle: it makes sure
 Wontonimo: but each seed costs as much as all the seeds out there, so it would cost n*(n+1)
 itzluku: If both players send a seed to the same place on the same turn, neither seed is planted and the sun points are refunded. The source tree, however, still becomes dormant. 
 Wontonimo: 870 , surely you could do something more efficient than that
 itzluku: how do these infinite loops exist
 itzluku: or is this new and they updated it
 CGGCoder: wdym
 itzluku: The source tree, however, still becomes dormant. 
 itzluku: i saw some games
 itzluku: where this wanst a thing
 CGGCoder: Just make it move elsewhere
 itzluku: wasn't*
 CGGCoder: idk i joined bronze yesterday
 itzluku: maybe someone here still has a link
 Wontonimo: yup N1 bowwowforeach is using a simulation.
 itzluku: c++ kekw
 CGGCoder: wait a sec HOW AM I RANK 3700 BY DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING?
 itzluku: 1 day ago i was hoping for top100, now i figth for top300 hahaha
 StyllyMyle: You are talking in this chat and is active xD
 itzluku: there are alot who passed wood1 and then stopped i guess
 CGGCoder: o
 CGGCoder: Imma go on holiday on the 13/05 so imma not be back until then
 CGGCoder: so rip my Gold dream
 Dr-D: Is there a way to get rid of lanuage assist?
 CGGCoder: Why?
 Dr-D: Coding in an extra ide anyhow
 ItsNotABug: Code in notepad and copy paste?
 CGGCoder: rip the Ctrl+Z
 Tiramon: you could use cg local to code in extrnal ide
 jrke: btw i always wanted to ask
 jrke: how to setup CG local ide

 CGGCoder: I in-game because I'm too lazy for everything with an IDE
 CGGCoder: *I choose
 icecream17: oh i figure out how codingame does turns a hexagonal grid into (x, y, z)
 icecream17: 3d grid has 3 axis: x, y, z
 Ajaiy2: hello
 icecream17: so hexagon could have 3 axis too
 icecream17: hi
 icecream17: 31, 15, 5, 0, 2, 9, 22 = x axis
 icecream17: 28, 13, 4, 0, 1, 7, 19 = y axis
 icecream17: 25, 11, 3, 0, 6, 17, 34 = z axis
 cegprakash: is the number of actions per hour infinite until both players play "WAIT"?
 StyllyMyle: yes
 icecream17: y
 cegprakash: assuming 6 hours in a day
 icecream17: *a day is infinite
 icecream17: oh wait
 icecream17: nvm
 Tiramon: only thing that limit your actions per day are your suns and your non dormant trees
 CGGCoder: yeah
 icecream17: 16 = direction 5 + direction 6
 Tiramon: each action will remove a tree or make a tree dormant ... so you can't do more actions than you have trees
 cegprakash: how many actions before the sun moves?
 cegprakash: without trees becoming dormant
 CGGCoder: as many as you want
 CGGCoder: until the 'WAIT' command
 cegprakash: if both players print WAIT does it mean the sun moves or does it mean the day changes?
 Ajaiy2: Does anyone want a good algorithm to pass wood 1?
 Tiramon: both
 Tiramon: the sun direction changes when the day changes
 cegprakash: weird
 Tiramon: The sun's direction will therefore always be equal to the current day modulo 6.
 cegprakash: sun rises in the east everyday
 cegprakash: isn't it
 jrke: cegprakash sun changes when day changes
 Smelty: yes
 Ajaiy2: Anyone?
 itzluku: what&#160;?:D
 itzluku: u sell me a good wood1 alg?
 Ajaiy2: A good algorithm to pass Wood 1
 itzluku: how much
 Ajaiy2: Not money
 itzluku: :D
 Ajaiy2: Why would I do that
 Tiramon: Ajaiy2 wood leagues are tutorialthey are the easiest leagues ...
 Ajaiy2: Just telling
 itzluku: enlighten me pls
 Ajaiy2: What do you mean?
 itzluku: tell me your secret
 cegprakash: if sun rises in the east today does it mean sun rises in the west after 3 days? I'm confused
 Tiramon: cegprakash just read the statement and don't try to adapt this game to real world
 icecream17: each day there are turns. as many turns as you want. sun direction = day mod 6
 itzluku: sun rotates in the neighbor index structure
 Tiramon: trees are also not grown by spirits ..
 Tiramon: at least as far as i know
 struct: I knew we lived in a hex
 Ajaiy2: Do you mean the algorithm, itzluku?
 Smelty: yes
 itzluku: yes
 Ajaiy2: oh
 itzluku: i am waiting
 Ajaiy2: ok
 cegprakash: struct u kidding me right?
 itzluku: ur will u send it to me through a fishing link
 itzluku: u need to build up more hype for me to click it
 Ajaiy2: ok?
 struct: no
 cegprakash: Tiramon okay so this is a world in some other parallel universe gotcha
 Ajaiy2: I never knew you liked suspense
 struct: earth is an hex
 Tiramon: it's a game ...
 struct: lol
 Tiramon: oh an earth could be populated with hexes .. .but you would still ne 12 pentagons ...but that is another story ...

 Tiramon: i like that movie =)
 Numby: Ok ... I'm making the switch to a bit board and using bits and shifts. Main challenge is how do you make sure code is correct lol (also readability). Also no macros in java so I either gotta call functions or take on more ugliness&#160;:(
 geppoz: Tiramon look at the end of this page for Earth tesselation&#160;;)
 Tiramon: to check if it is correct ... try local testcases
 geppoz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geppoz.eu/curiosamat/geometria.html">https://www.geppoz.eu/curiosamat/geometria.html</a>
 Tiramon: oh i alread calculated goldberg polyhedrons =)
 MerryMentat: For correctness, if you can stand to take the time, you can copy paste out the game information from the bottom of the screen and write some code to parse it.  If you also have your code print out all of the input you get, that's enough to test that your simulator matches what they send you.
 MerryMentat: That method has a few gotchas, like when you wait and your opponent takes a few turns, the game doesn't send you the input of what the board looks like during those turns.
 MerryMentat: So you have to save it all up and then check when they send you the board state in the next game day.
 MerryMentat: But other than that, it works well.
 Ajaiy2: Ok itzluku...are you ready?
 Ajaiy2: The link is ready
 CGGCoder: How do you do a bitmap on a hex board?
 solistice: just so I am certain: It is okay to recreate the game for simulation purposes right? That's not considered cheating?
 solistice: Are there actions that are "not" allowed, preprocessing / training networks and so on?
 MerryMentat: Simulating the game state is totally allowed.
 CGGCoder: Idk but i don't thin kso
 MerryMentat: I don't think any of the rest of that is disallowed.
 MerryMentat: You're definitely not allowed to hack their servers.
 itzluku: no u took to long
 MerryMentat: So I guess that's some "action" you can't do.
 Ajaiy2: Uh..It works really good
 Ajaiy2: It took some time to type
 itzluku: thats life
 Ajaiy2: I agree
 itzluku: i agree
 Ajaiy2: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://justnotepad.com/get/e28a9c81cd4a1787ed7afcd4e5fd6cc5">http://justnotepad.com/get/e28a9c81cd4a1787ed7afcd4e5fd6cc5</a>
 Ajaiy2: The password is Challenge123
 itzluku: hm why do u not just weight each option by richness and size and just choose the best 
 Ajaiy2: if you grow more you get more sunlight
 Ajaiy2: I calculated all the ways and ended up with this
 CGGCoder: If the amount of sunlight received is lesser than 8&gt;
 CGGCoder: Why?
 itzluku: but 3 t1 trees throw the same amout as 1 t3 tree
 itzluku: it doesnt matter what tree u grow in wood
 Ajaiy2: Because that is the amount of sunlight to complete two trees
 Ajaiy2: No if you complete you get more points
 CGGCoder: But why lesse?
 CGGCoder: +r
 itzluku: but if u make all seeds into t1 and then allt1 into t2 you will have to pay more for upgrades
 Ajaiy2: I never did that
 Ajaiy2: I just told to grow a tree if you could
 Ajaiy2: Not ALL level 1 trees
 Ajaiy2: And Its 8 because you cannot grow 3 level 3 trees within 6 days
 itzluku: yeh but u grow all t2 to t3 at once
 Ajaiy2: No it will take a lot of money if you grow all T1 to T2 at once
 itzluku: if u make the last tree t2 u will pay more suns than just making one t2 t3 and then making that last t1 t2
 Ajaiy2: Because of the additional number of thinng
 Ajaiy2: But you wont get paid after day 6
 Ajaiy2: So you can conserve when you got enought
 Ajaiy2: enough
 itzluku: whats your solution to get out of bronze xd
 Ajaiy2: Idk
 Ajaiy2: ill figure it out
 cegprakash: dbdr crazy win rate
 Ajaiy2: It took really long
 Ajaiy2: to find the algorithm
 itzluku: why
 Numby: RE: how to make bitboard when grid is hex - you can treat the "grid" as a flat array of 37 cells since cells are uniquely identifiable by their index. You just need to hardcode (or precompute) a bunch of relationships between the cells
 Ajaiy2: I can ensure you it will give you a crazy win rate
 Ajaiy2: I mean CRAZY
 itzluku: well
 itzluku: u mean crazy 100%?
 itzluku: C r A z Y
 Ajaiy2: As long as someone doesn't use the same algorithm, YES
 Ajaiy2: I need to test it tho
 itzluku: then why did u share your secret algorithm
 itzluku: TO THE WORLD
 Ajaiy2: Well, there will be more people to fight with at BRONZE
 Ajaiy2: hehehe
 Ajaiy2: Wait...is this considered cheating?
 itzluku: using your code?
 itzluku: dw it wount work in bronze
 Ajaiy2: well, you cant win with THAT in bronze
 Ajaiy2: But it works like a charm in wood 1
 itzluku: but does it work in wood2&#160;???
 CGGCoder: I guess
 Ajaiy2: Yeah?
 CGGCoder: Wood 2 is easier than Wood 1
 CGGCoder: ahhh
 CGGCoder: When it comes to bronze, idk what to do with the seed option
 YKY: Hi everyone. I need some help.
 itzluku: regarding what
 YKY: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.--&gt; Why this message occurs?? I checked my code again and again, but it seems there are no errors in ouput logic
 itzluku: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 LionTurtleWan: hey i am new to codingame, but is there a way to run your code outside of the test cases you get?
 itzluku: idk check the github repo
 UndercoverToad: do you mean offline or on custom testcases?
 UndercoverToad: YKY do you have 2 print statements in the main loop?
 LionTurtleWan: eehm just while editing in the editor in the site
 LionTurtleWan: or is it easier to write my code in an offline editor?
 UndercoverToad: depending on the puzzle type (for non-interactive ones) you can define a custom testcase
 UndercoverToad: on the left: settings=&gt;expert
 UndercoverToad: then go to the testcase area and select "manual"
 LionTurtleWan: ill have a look thakns
 YKY: Oh I got it. I had several outputs in main.
 YKY: Thx a lot
 Smelty: my code is horrendous and doesnt work
 Smelty: ....yay
 Dr-D: It even smells!!

 UndercoverToad: i'm at 460 lines of madness
 AntiSquid: 300 lol
 UndercoverToad: not even coding in D? shame
 Ajaiy2: Im gonna try to find a goddamn algorithm which will promote you to top 3 in bronze
 Dr-D: Does 'Dart' counts as 'D'ish enough?
 UndercoverToad: not at all
 AntiSquid: i was going to code on my alt in D if i hate the game (which i do) but i forgot about this and started already on my main 
 Smelty: im at 500
 Numby: 800 should I be embarrassed
 Smelty: depends on how well it performs
 Smelty: rn, my eval says null
 icecream17: I still didn't add search yet, but I did add a bonus for non shadows
 orangesnowfox: smhmh, I haven't played since before the weekend :c
 icecream17: but now my depth 0 eval takes anywhere from 0 to 12 ms
 orangesnowfox: wait wat
 icecream17: *depth 1
 orangesnowfox: ah
 Smelty: lolol
 Smelty: my eval doesnt time out, but it just doesnt work
 AntiSquid: so if it times out it means it works?
 Smelty: its supposedd to return scores ordered in descending and the hexes for which the scores are for
 Smelty: but, it returns: null
 orangesnowfox: Anyone mind telling me what I missed the last few days?
 Smelty: nothing much
 orangesnowfox: like, yesterday, really
 Smelty: just everyone getting smarter with their ais
 orangesnowfox: haha... Not me, I haven't even written my sim yet
 Chainman: Are people teaming up&#160;?
 Chainman: I'm dropping lots of places, since yesterday.
 UndercoverToad: this is a solo contest
 Chainman: okay
 orangesnowfox: Just more people starting since it's the weekend Chainman
 orangesnowfox: I still don't do SEED
 Chainman: btw what is the meaning of sim?  
 orangesnowfox: simulation
 Chainman: for this contest, this is my first time in AI contest
 Chainman: But what does that mean lol
 Chainman: I have slight idea, but not sure I know.
 RoboStac: copying the games rules into your code so you can try moves and then evaluate future positions instead of just evaluating the position given by the server
 Chainman: Oh right, thanks
 Chainman: That sounds tough, cause you won't know what moves your opponent will make in those future moves. 
 TobiasA: you have to assume your opponent is a smarty pants and choose the smartest move for your opponent
 orangesnowfox: If they aren't playing optimally it doesn't matter that your search was worthless, you get a better result anyway :p
 orangesnowfox: How are we doing shadow masks?
 Xenoid: Completely ignoring the fact the opponent moves is also surprisingly effective (although not the best strategy)
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... And with minimax random scoring also gives decent output
 Chainman: I hope can get top 100 ignoring opponent lol:sweat_smile:
 orangesnowfox: (high move mobility0
 Xenoid: Making good moves in the first place is more important than responding to what your opponent does
 orangesnowfox: ^
 orangesnowfox: it's also really hard to evaluate states
 orangesnowfox: lol
 TobiasA: true
 TobiasA: very true
 TobiasA: very very true
 Chainman: alright, I'm excited anyways.  going to work on heuristics based on board state. 
 itzluku: oh shit i found an index error lol
 Chainman: :cry:
 itzluku: typo
 itzluku: referenzed idnex but i had no index var
 itzluku: prob lost alot of games without knowing the game got aborted early haha
 icecream17: wish codingame could highlight games where you crashed
 Smelty: yea that would be great
 Maliamnon: is it true that inputs only change on each day and are not updated mid-round?
 UndercoverToad: that's false
 Maliamnon: ty
 itzluku: ~#300 i converge to 50 50 w/l yikes
 itzluku: now on 400
 itzluku: wtf
 kreska: day ends only when two players stop taking actions so you can both take multiple actions per day and input will change accordingly
 Smelty: bruv my comparing ai doesnt even fUnction
 Chainman: each day is a round essentially
 ybbruh: fellas can someone explain to me how the games work
 ybbruh: the ones with the character movement and stuff
 VincentHch: Does a tree shadowed create itself a shadow&#160;? It seems that it is not the case but it not specified in the rules
 UndercoverToad: it is the case VincentHch
 VincentHch: thx
 Xzoky174: hi
 Chainman: hey
 KelvinAndHubbles: setup beam search in python, but that's too slow to do that many calculations, should I switch to something like c++
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: you won't get happy if you try a search algo in Python
 kovi: beam in python or heuristic in c++...what is the difference
 KelvinAndHubbles: speed I'm guessing?
 UndercoverToad: takeover of C++ is pretty much done already. Yesterday top10 was full of Python
 itzluku: got some java / c# contenders
 itzluku: PogU
 UndercoverToad: i'm guilty regarding C# :angel:
 Donald_D._Doge: what's a PogU&#160;?
 itzluku: xd
 Donald_D._Doge: eggs dee
 itzluku: waiting for Haskell to take #1
 Smelty: well my new bot is now functional, but its still stupid
 UndercoverToad: but speed-wise Java and C# are closer to C++ than to Python
 KelvinAndHubbles: well, Python is just about as slow as you can get
 Smelty: xD
 StyllyMyle: Python?
 StyllyMyle: Damn thats 100x slower
 itzluku: i mean python makes use of alot of non python written libs .. so python can eb pretty fast xd
 Smelty: truth
 itzluku: just look at all the crazy stuff u can do with numpy
 AntiSquid: not crazy enough
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, I'm just worried that the two hours that it took to write my python beam search algo will turn into a week of banging my head against the wall of c++ syntax
 Smelty: xD
 itzluku: @AntoSquid what would be 
 AntiSquid: plenty of sites that favour python a lot more, this one isn't the one
 Smelty: lolol
 herrmann: Your search tree using Python objects won't get any of that native performance from underlying C libs though
 Ajaiy2: YAY! I got promoted to bronze!
 VizGhar: wp
 YKY: What time will other leagues open?
 UndercoverToad: silver in 23h
 ashiknur: at the end of 10th?or at the start of 10th?
 AntiSquid: top 1000 cut off or top 500&#160;? :P
 DetoBot: top 40.0 points
 struct: 500 seems low
 DetoBot: :grimacing:
 UndercoverToad: 800
 DetoBot: or those who beat the BronzeAI
 AntiSquid: ashiknur in 23 hours lol .
 AntiSquid: start counting
 ghassen: fun fact .. the Bronze AI will change to always allow a certain percentage to pass
 DetoBot: too much too count
 DetoBot: better sleep
 DetoBot: yeah BronzeAi, it will handle
 GuillaumeBardy: someone know how works (how is is calculated) the ratio used to process global ranking&#160;?
 Smelty: hi deto!
 Smelty: :D
 DetoBot: :innocent:
 Smelty: uwu
 Smelty: my current scoring bot (red) vs my old if/else bot (blue): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/550330791">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/550330791</a>
 Smelty: its still not as good so i amn't submitting
 DetoBot: lol the messages are enough to beat the oppo
 Smelty: lolol
 DetoBot: :sleeping: see you later
 Smelty: see you
 icecream17: it would be interesting to have a game where you can send numbers to your opponent
 Smelty: xD yea
 Smelty: what seems to be top players strat?
 UndercoverToad: i'm in top10 and have no idea what's going on
 UndercoverToad: just trowing CPU at it and hope that something good happens
 Smelty: (xD)
 icecream17: interesting - if both players complete the same amount (likely), then the player who completes the trees earlier wins
 Smelty: thing is though, i don't know waht type of plant should get more points
 Smelty: yes icecream
 icecream17: so you want to complete as early as possible
 icecream17: but then
 icecream17: you wont have any trees to make sun
 Smelty: yep
 icecream17: so really, you want to complete your trees just before he opponent does
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: so you can also put if opponent tree&gt;3 then start completing?
 icecream17: but the opponent also wants to do that
 kovi: heuristic is stil ok for top10&#160;;)
 Smelty: hmm
 UndercoverToad: kovi you have heuristics?
 icecream17: ok, submitting
 kovi: yap
 UndercoverToad: woah :o
 UndercoverToad: tell me about them so i can integrate them in my scoring
 kovi:&#160;;)
 icecream17: :joy:
 Smelty: :rofl:
 kreska: tell us all so we can meet you at the top:D
 icecream17: struc is 91st ...!
 Smelty: dang
 jacek: oO
 struct: I dont even need to check my rank
 struct: I get updated here
 StyllyMyle: One benefit of being famous:
 Chainman: :rofl:
 VizGhar: Can't you fairly easily copycat heuristic?
 VizGhar: I have first 5 days and last 2 days hardcoded
 VizGhar: wonder how tf I'll write the eval function
 kreska: i have nothing hardcoded
 VizGhar: good for you
 jacek: VizGhar easy, just interpolate in between
 kreska: i dont know if its good
 kreska: its interesting
 VizGhar: hehe... like I'm drawing line :D
 kreska: i wonder if there are many solutions to this problem or one correct way
 Smelty: o .          o
 VizGhar: jacek why u 1047? trying NNs?&#160;:)
 VizGhar: well kreska there is for sure one correct way... we are just not capable of telling which way is that
 kreska: yes you are probably right :D 
 kreska: its just hard to imagine one :D
 VizGhar: well its only 24 days of game... I can imagine, I could beat most of the AI's here :D
 icecream17: ooh, the worth() of a tree completion is (regular worth) + (# of opponent big trees)
 jacek: opponent?
 kreska: so the more big trees oponnent have the more worth of tree completion?
 icecream17: yeah, if you complete a tree, your opponent loses 1 nutrient * big trees
 kreska: ok this is interesting it sound logical to me:D
 stefan-gg: is there a  bug with because it throws an exception for this for some reason int nutrients = in.nextInt();  btw its generated code
 stefan-gg: bug with java*
 jacek: promoted to new league?
 UndercoverToad: input format doesn't change between leagues
 UndercoverToad: probably just modified some parsing code by accident
 stefan-gg: hmm gonna check that ty
 StyllyMyle: Anyone up
 Michael_48: no
 StyllyMyle: I wana chalenge and see how much my bot improved
 Donald_D._Doge: then why not do it?
 StyllyMyle: nvmm lool
 Donald_D._Doge: lol StyllyMyle bruh
 MindController: C++
 MindController: Anyone know what is the root of this error?
 MindController: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
 MindController: Fixed
 jacek: glad to be helpful
 AntiSquid: taking credit where it's due
 Chainman: oof
 algeo: rab
 jrke: damn can't get whats happening with my code
 jrke:&#160;:(
 CGGCoder: Do you have any tips for how to make an algorithm that's somewhat successful in Bronze? I'm currently out of strategies and such
 PasteDog: give each possible action a score, execute the highest scoring action 
 algeo: Grow seed grow seed complete repeat :nerd:
 jacek: retire and die
 algeo: wait 
 Donald_D._Doge: i'm waiting algeo
 algeo: lol
 VizGhar: that was it algeo? we were waiting for like 30seconds
 icecream17: is there a way to figure out what part of your code is slow
 Donald_D._Doge: profile it 
 VizGhar: some IDE profilers?
 VizGhar: what language?
 icecream17: typescript
 VizGhar: ok, cant help you
 BrunoFelthes: all code
 AntiSquid: ya i can guess which part
 Nerchio: use C++ so you dont need to find slow code because its all fast
 Zenoscave: icecream I'm not sure if they optimize typescript. you might be better off transpiling locally and submitting JS
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=typescript+profilers&amp;ia=i_use_arch">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=typescript+profilers&amp;ia=i_use_arch</a> icecream17
 Zenoscave: Anti you use arch?
 icecream17: how do you run the spring challenge repo
 AntiSquid: ya i use arch btw
 StyllyMyle: Hm
 icecream17: i already cloned it
 Zenoscave: I did too for a number of years. Might switch back soon 
 Zenoscave: icecream17 you need to make a few changes to run locally
 AntiSquid: lol, no but i like the meme Zenobia
 Zenoscave: PM me
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: Lol two zeno's
 AntiSquid: Zenzoo
 Zenoscave: I can only think about senzu beans now
 ashiknur: can someone give me permission to message on discord?
 AntiSquid: ok you may
 Zenoscave: lol
 jacek: :rage:
 LegendaryStone: :angry:
 Zenoscave: Jacek why rage?
 jacek: no discord ~
 ashiknur: I am saying because, message box is not working. It says you do not have permission to send message in this chanel
 jacek: huh
 Zenoscave: What chanel...
 jacek: coco chanel
 AntiSquid: lol .... reading comprehension over 90000
 algeo: read only  ?
 AntiSquid: so click another channel&#160;: general
 Nerchio: is left side of the board OP?
 Nerchio: or is it just me
 UndercoverToad: hey Zeno you wanted to win C#
 Paluke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ae3f7ac5-2c71-4c69-bd83-3b1ae277126e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ae3f7ac5-2c71-4c69-bd83-3b1ae277126e</a>
 AntiSquid: you mean player 1??
 Nerchio: well depends on the starting position
 Nerchio: sometimes it top/bottom
 Nerchio: just pretty sure left &gt; right
 AntiSquid: did you notice it for top bots too?
 Nerchio: too much homework antisquid :D
 Nerchio: but it would make sense to me, first couple rounds shade is not that important and after a few rounds sun comes back to shine west-&gt; east and you get shaded lose eco and lose the game
 Astrobytes: Shady business.
 icecream17: how long does it take for java to download?
 ddreams: on a 14.4 modem?
 Astrobytes: Less than RAM does.
 AntiSquid: so doesn't that mean right &gt; left 
 Nerchio: why
 Nerchio: around day 6 is usually when some kind of economy kicks in and sun is shining from west to east
 ddreams: well, people who do selfplay should be able to answer that question
 AntiSquid: ah ok
 icecream17: ohhh there were two screens: one with a progress bar at 0, and a hidden screen where i had to click "next"
 Zenoscave: icecream what version of java are you downloading
 Nerchio: maybe if they added fog of war to the game it would be better 
 Nerchio: :joy:
 AntiSquid: there is fog of war
 AntiSquid: it's called no inputs if you wait
 AntiSquid: see? very sneaky
 Astrobytes: Or if it was interesting in the first place...
 icecream17: "Java SE Development Kit 8 Update 291 (64-bit) Successfully Installed"
 Westicles: Zenoscave, do you autopublish your solutions?
 icecream17: huh, it looks like i've tried to use java before
 icecream17: C:/ProgramFiles/Java shows jdk1.8.0_291 AND jdk-14.0.1... also jre1.8.0_271 and jre1.8.0_291
 AntiSquid: did you add path variable&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Just did once Westicles Was curious which community solutions didn't have working examples
 icecream17: javac works now!
 AntiSquid: you can find all the setup info with google ... ok good
 icecream17: yes, i was following some old webpage
 Zenoscave: icecream17 you need maven too probably
 Zenoscave: are you still working on the referee stuff?
 AntiSquid: think maven is installed automatically with intellj
 Zenoscave: oh cool
 cegprakash: euler stop submitting and wrecking me
 UndercoverToad: euler is not here, just UndercoverToad
 Zenoscave: Toad use hypnosis!!!
 UndercoverToad: first in C# will be hard, Illedan is breaking our agreement&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: sorry Zeno, can't give you a free pass with ille in the game
 Chainman: I like how couple people wrote solution in bash
 UndercoverToad: python -c "code here"
 UndercoverToad: works like a charm
 TobiasA: on what condition can a simulated game be over
 Zenoscave: I did Mean Max in True bash at first
 UndercoverToad: you like torture
 Illedan: ^
 Zenoscave: Just a lot
 Zenoscave: Illedan you're recking my free pass
 Zenoscave: quit it
 UndercoverToad: coders of the carribbean had a bash legend bot
 Zenoscave: you and about 15 other new c#'s
 TobiasA: hm? does anyone know
 UndercoverToad: but turned out it was a bash wrapper for a python bot
 Zenoscave: day 24 is done TobiasA
 jacek: or 'starts'
 Zenoscave: oh yeah day 23 is done
 TobiasA: how many turns are there in a day?
 Zenoscave: infinite until both players use wait
 struct: Yeah I remember that toad
 MoMaT: @Tobias, depends on how much energy you have accumulated, it's finite.
 Zenoscave: if (opponent.isWaiting &amp;&amp; dady == 23 &amp;&amp; Action.type == "WAIT") sim.Over()
 Astrobytes: dady eh
 Zenoscave: MoMaT of course it's finite
 Zenoscave: just harder to type that conditional
 Zenoscave: *day
 Zenoscave: Do one Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: OK Dad
 UndercoverToad: you check the opponent waiting state?
 TobiasA: ok thanks
 MoMaT: and people should stop calling it a day. it's not a day.
 TobiasA: what is it?
 MoMaT: shadow doesn't change angle form day to day but from hour to hour.
 Zenoscave: Not in my sim
 Cryptouser: hi
 UndercoverToad: i like calling it a day. and turning off the office PC
 Zenoscave: buduntss
 struct: im going to close chat until legend
 struct: might be forever&#160;:(
 MoMaT: maybe on some your flat earth models it does...
 Cryptouser: how can i make a series of challenges for a private  clash of code
 Illedan: lol
 Astrobytes: My a*rse struct
 UndercoverToad: farewell struct
 Illedan: struct, stay :D
 Zenoscave: everyone ping struct
 struct: I dont ear pings
 Astrobytes: structured or unstructured pings for struct?
 Zenoscave: fine. Automaton2000 get euler
 Automaton2000: you need to change that
 Astrobytes: Automaton2000 get eulerscheZahl
 TobiasA: when silver is open do you have to beet bronze boss to get to silver 
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000 how's your bot
 Automaton2000: but sometimes it can be avoided
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 Automaton2000: so that's what it seems
 Astrobytes: Yes TobiasA
 TobiasA: ok thanks
 Zenoscave: unless they start the bronze boss below you initially
 Zenoscave: I'm think 800-1000
 Astrobytes: In which case, you already beat it
 Zenoscave: pedantics schmantics
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: I dont think theyll go lower than 20%
 Zenoscave: struct close your chat
 struct: Wood bosses usually are not this easy
 Illedan: Only 10 in silver
 struct: Blame the testers
 Zenoscave: struct I blame you
 Illedan: Thx for the easy bosses
 AntiSquid: you should be able to get legend struct with that headstart you had
 struct: I wanted my bot to be wood 1 boss
 Astrobytes: Skipping wood is always useful
 AntiSquid: ya wood skip was good
 Illedan: Struct lost his headstart by submitting his best bot early
 struct: yeah
 AntiSquid: really? he could continue to improve :P
 struct: I think it might have helped some people
 Astrobytes: What, your code?
 Westicles: ooh, dapo tweeted he's going to play
 Illedan: he got twitter?
 Illedan: Link?
 AntiSquid: how does westicles know&#160;?
 struct: my code astro?
 Astrobytes: "I think it might have helped some people"
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Westicles: let me look for the link... can't seem to find it
 struct: ah 
 UndercoverToad: Illedan i'm coming :muscle:
 Illedan: hmpf
 Astrobytes: Westicles trolling again?
 Illedan: Down you go :D
 UndercoverToad: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: I had 4-0 vs you on this submit :D
 struct: He was in coder one discord
 struct: but didnt join the game
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: he did
 UndercoverToad: but I added center bonus now
 struct: he did?
 Illedan: hmm
 struct: which rank did he place?
 AntiSquid: team ascend
 UndercoverToad: dapo got 3rd at coderone
 struct: ah
 Astrobytes: Nice
 struct: valgrowth was solo?
 AntiSquid: he says he had a bug, considering the lack of testing not surprised
 TobiasA: is it possible to simulate to the end of the game and get an action within 100ms?
 Illedan: Try for yourself
 Illedan: It is a contest
 UndercoverToad: with a very small beam it's possible
 TobiasA: oh i didn't notice
 UndercoverToad: like greedy choice
 UndercoverToad: but won't be helpful in any way
 TobiasA: thanks
 struct: sim wait
 AntiSquid: i am sure he was, read his blog to check, struct he already wrote his review for coderone
 struct: you will reach end in no time
 UndercoverToad: valgrowt h was solo
 UndercoverToad: sima n could have joined but didn't according to his twitter
 AntiSquid: coderone wrote like 10 times on their discord they want to be the #1 bot contest site, let's see how long it will take them&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/_simanman/status/1390565771336556545">https://twitter.com/_simanman/status/1390565771336556545</a>
 ja_fica: struct, have you used alpha-beta pruning in tic-tac-toe for the last plays?
 UndercoverToad: they surely have to bypass CG and RAIC to become #1
 Astrobytes: Dapo did not tweet that he's playing.
 AntiSquid: "I got a prize when I teamed up with Val (hey)" so just being part of the team? :D
 struct: no, I used vanilla MCTS
 UndercoverToad: except they have different metrics what #1 is
 UndercoverToad: player count?prize money?
 struct: from start to finish
 ja_fica: DFS over BFS
 AntiSquid: winner of the bracket
 Queuebee: can you just spawn #somechat like that
 Zenoscave: UndercoverToad how do you profile your C#?
 struct: on uttt yes
 UndercoverToad: "If I had teamed up with Val, I would have won the prize money (hey!)."
 UndercoverToad: that's how deepl translates it
 AntiSquid: there were too many draws so they played the bots multiple times UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: visual studio has a nice profiler
 Zenoscave: *without windows
 UndercoverToad: i'm totally willing to use office equipment for personal needs
 Zenoscave: I feel I ask this everycontest
 Astrobytes: You do
 cegprakash: I want only 500 guys to promote to SIlver tomorrow but I doubt CG might open it for 2000 people
 UndercoverToad: there is a mono profiler which is okay-ishbut far from VS
 AntiSquid: found out yet&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: I should remember the answer i find next time
 UndercoverToad: still some gap between #4 and #5 that's hard to break through&#160;:/
 Illedan: Yeah, I wonder what feature is missing
 ja_fica: Vou tentar ultrapassar-te nisso, tenho um agente fixe feito em keras(python) mas não dá para transpor para aqui nem o conseguia fazer em menos de 100ms, por isso vou utilizar tecnicas mais viaveis
 UndercoverToad: and aCat sending his students again
 cegprakash: euler is coming @UndercoverToad don't worry
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: Search on the discord, pretty sure you asked there at some point
 Zenoscave: thanks astro
 UndercoverToad: nah, euler is a failure so far
 Zenoscave: I did. I'm using my answer there but getting a new issue
 cegprakash: euler in silent mode too
 cegprakash: so he's upto something big
 AntiSquid: ja_fica english por favor
 UndercoverToad: i am euler in case you missed that
 UndercoverToad: browser kept crashing when I opened that chat with so many active users
 cegprakash: oh
 Zenoscave: Too many follows?
 UndercoverToad: moderators can see everyone online on the chat
 struct: no just mod benefits
 UndercoverToad: 1000 users at once =&gt; crash
 UndercoverToad: or very laggy if I switch to firefox
 Zenoscave: yikes
 Astrobytes: It's just starting to slow down for me now
 UndercoverToad: my default is Crhomium
 Donald_D._Doge: hey i have alt on top of main and it doesn't crash
 Scuffed: :worried:
 cegprakash: may be someone's curse UndercoverToad .. may be u trolled someone to read prob statement when you weren't asked specifically for help
 Zenoscave: maybe that someone should rtfps
 Zenoscave: anyways
 Astrobytes: Crhomium - at least you got the periodic table symbol correct
 Donald_D._Doge: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/9OHm6FsgJM8?t=36">https://youtu.be/9OHm6FsgJM8?t=36</a> cegprakash i have to share this again with you my friend
 UndercoverToad: if you refer to martinpapa 2 or 3 days ago: i also gave a helpful answer before mentioning that it's in the statement
 struct: gl ja_fica, im not sure py3 will be enough though
 icecream17: yes! i built the brutaltester jar
 UndercoverToad: and I think I can talk to him like that (old rivalry but we get along well. just trolling)
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: dude, nobody intends any offence to you with the problem statement thing
 UndercoverToad: like me fighting with ille for first in c#
 Zenoscave: nice icecream17
 cegprakash: wuut eulersche throwing away ranks just by choosing C#
 cegprakash: interesting
 Zenoscave: cegprakash euler always starts C#
 UndercoverToad: c# is the language I know best
 Zenoscave: rarely doesn't stick
 UndercoverToad: last time I converted to C++ but didn't really help
 Astrobytes: I thought German :thinking:
 Illedan: Damn, nice score now euler :O
 Zenoscave: moin euler
 UndercoverToad: a few extra sims but could have used the time for features instead
 UndercoverToad: thanks Illedan
 UndercoverToad: and dropping just as you mention it :D
 AntiSquid: jynxed it
 Illedan:&#160;;)
 Illedan: Everything as planned
 Zenoscave: Ok I need to figure out a better eval
 VizGhar: I'd like to drop too from #5 to #6&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: easy: get #5 first
 dbdr: Zenoscave me too
 UndercoverToad: i still have this crazy and unrealistic dream of winning once :hugging:
 Illedan: ^
 UndercoverToad: i know that emoji says hugging but i see it as hovering on a cloud
 Illedan: Me2
 Illedan: I want a Canvas
 UndercoverToad: a canvas for winning and not creating a contest
 UndercoverToad: big difference
 Illedan: ^
 Astrobytes: You could technically print your own
 Illedan: ofc
 Illedan: Astrobytes :door:
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Gagat: Having both is nice too :D
 UndercoverToad: i can't kick, wrong account
 Gagat: As for printing, I seriously considered printing a CSB one at some point
 Gagat: haha
 UndercoverToad: CSB isn't even my favorite artwork
 Gagat: Which one is it&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: but Tonton made some cool stuff
 UndercoverToad: hm, let me see
 Gagat: I like the OOC art work
 UndercoverToad: A*Craft was cool
 Illedan: Yeah, OOC is nice :D

 UndercoverToad: I really wanted that
 AntiSquid: ooc is nice
 Queuebee: ah.
 Illedan: Gagat, when do you submit your real bot? :D
 Gagat: I don't have a real bot

 Gagat: I have a crappy bot
 Gagat: It's submitted :D
 Gagat: and very, very, very crappy :D
 UndercoverToad: i'll go with fantastic bits or codebusters for the artwork
 Illedan: I'll give it a few days and suddenly wild DUCT appreas
 struct: gitc looks nice
 AntiSquid: BotG best
 Gagat: Where can I see the A*Craft art&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: BotG art is meh
 Gagat: or all other contests too...
 UndercoverToad: maybe because i'm not into marvel at all
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 kick the infidel
 Automaton2000: its going to be helpful
 Illedan: Yeah, I like botg
 Gagat: I'm on the multi page, but it's not really obvious where to look...

 Gagat: Thanks struct
 Zenoscave: is that bannable to say Anti?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that was nice
 AntiSquid: who made the A*Craft art btw?
 Astrobytes:  /ban the Zeno
 UndercoverToad: freelancer I think
 Gagat: nice page for the recap UndercoverToad
 AntiSquid: who is zeno&#160;?
 Zenoscave: an infidel
 AntiSquid: that person doesn't exist
 Zenoscave: Ouch.
 UndercoverToad: and OoC was from shutterstock
 Astrobytes: Shocking.
 Astrobytes: x2
 UndercoverToad: shuttershock
 Gagat: Hmmmm the CSB art isn't that nice&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: oh, shockshock?
 Illedan: BR2k art :D
 Astrobytes: shuttershutter shockshock
 AntiSquid: code vs zombie art is nice imo
 Gagat: struct, I'm failing to get a direct link to the image like you got&#160;:/
 Gagat: I'm trying right click on the image -&gt; inspect
 UndercoverToad: which one do you want?
 Gagat: The CSB one to see it full screen
 Gagat: but mostly I'd be interested in the method too...
 AntiSquid: right click inspect element
 AntiSquid: and rummage through the code

 UndercoverToad: i'm up since 5:30 am and happy with that submit
 UndercoverToad: bedtime, see you tomorrow
 AntiSquid: bye
 Illedan: bye
 Illedan: I'm not happy with the submit
 Zenoscave: bye
 Gagat: ohhh, it's not a <img /> tag I should have looked for&#160;!
 Gagat: It's a div that *is* the image
 VizGhar: +700positions today... one more day like this and ill beat you all :D
 Astrobytes: lol, I went to bed at 5:00am
 Gagat: CIF artwork is nice indeed
 AntiSquid: why
 AntiSquid: astro
 Nerchio: i fixed a bug and my bot stopped working
 Nerchio: cool
 ShannonNorris97: If a tree is size 2, does it have to plant 2 cells away? or is that the maximum?
 Gagat: classic :D
 Astrobytes: It was the anniversary of the Cornell Grateful Dead show AntiSquid, appreciation of that was required late into the night
 Gagat: maximum
 ShannonNorris97: Thank you
 Gagat: It can plant closer
 Illedan: I'll take a break from this contest until thursday. Cya people. Kick me if I do something stupid :D
 KelvinAndHubbles: how do you output to debug in c++?
 fvla: cerr
 AntiSquid: i tried, kick doesn't work, sorry
 Astrobytes: lol, cya Illedan
 Illedan: I need to stop trying random values in my eval and code something serious
 Illedan: bot too dumb
 VizGhar: same here Illedan
 AntiSquid: i think i have something smart, but it's slower than expected and the eval is almost non-existent
 geppoz:&#160;?
 struct: Illedan time to use euler param fiddler
 itzluku: how do i lose to a guy in the arena, copy the seed and then with with the same seed
 ddreams: what's the param fiddler?
 itzluku: no way he updateted his bot in the last minute
 KelvinAndHubbles: itzluku use any random in yours?
 KelvinAndHubbles: or theirs too
 itzluku: no only for msg output xd
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/ParameterFiddler">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/ParameterFiddler</a>
 KelvinAndHubbles: my old python If else had a random selection between seed choices
 itzluku: hm maybe my opp did
 itzluku: true
 itzluku: but weird
 itzluku: sad i cant debug that game
 itzluku: had a weird shadow decition
 itzluku: sadge
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, I came up with that a lot where I would lose, send to IDE, and win due to randomness
 ddreams: nice
 ddreams: I should get brutaltester up and running
 struct: im not sure if param ifddler still works with current brutaltester
 itzluku: yo my new bot is owning
 itzluku: +200 places alrdy
 cegprakash: itzluku congrats
 struct: I used it in my arena bot using brutaltester 0.2 and a referee made by me

 itzluku: some ppl rly dont give a fk about nutrients
 Westicles: itzluku, just in case you didn't know you left the stream on. 
 Zenoscave: Finally!!!!
 Zenoscave: Turns out it was an out of date .net sdk version making my trace fail
 AntiSquid: itzluku what are you trying to do on stream? 
 Nerchio: hot tub stream?

 Zanoshky: refere?
 struct: check the example
 struct: referee needs to be compatible with brutaltester
 Loulou6: Hello&#160;! Does someone know how to find a specific battle&#160;? I want to know how works my bot against the one from my friend&#160;? :p
 geppoz: you can pick an "enemy" from IDE
 geppoz: not need to find a battle
 geppoz: delete the default opponent and pick another
 gbudau: Hello, anyone know what are the limits of this error?
 struct: Used to be 1 match every 20 seconds, I dont know what the limit is now
 gbudau: Thank you
 geppoz: struct  , is this referee compatible with brutaltester?
 Smelty: dangit-
 struct: you need to do a few changes I think
 SirLoxley: server under load now? I run into timeouts and my bot logic hasn't become that more complex
 therealbeef: timeouts can be crashes too
 CyrilMtl: Hi, what do they mean in bronze leagye&#160;: Players that are asleep do not receive input.&#160;?
 SirLoxley: found the issue ... too much debug logging.
 geppoz: as soon as a player outputs "WAIT", he fall asleep
 VizGhar: huuu new #1 :O
 geppoz: the other player can continue to play that day, and the asleep one doesn't receive any input for that
 CyrilMtl: what sort of input I would not receive if I sleep&#160;? I don't understand
 geppoz: when the second outputs "WAIT" too, a new day begins and both receive again inputs
 CyrilMtl: I don;t understand sorry
 geppoz: when you output "WAIT", you fall asleep
 ddreams: when you wait, the opponent plays until the next day
 ddreams: you don't see any of that
 geppoz: but the day is not over
 geppoz: so you dont receive inputs until next day (=until also the opponents WAIT)
 CyrilMtl: ok, I have to look at the 'day; concep
 CyrilMtl: concept
 ddreams: there can be many actions (rounds) in a day
 ddreams: but you can only take one action per round
 CyrilMtl: it is only since bronze&#160;?
 ddreams: are you still in Wood?
 CyrilMtl: I am bronze
 ddreams: pretty sure it was the same in wood
 CyrilMtl: I passed btih wood pretty quickly with a basic code (always a problem in each contest)
 BrunoFelthes: UI is not showing emojis at msg&#160;:/
 VizGhar: It's probably more intelligent then you think BrunoFelthes
 SirLoxley: need to stop now or it's 2 AM again lol
 AntiSquid: i know it's late in the contest, but why do we get shadows in the input&#160;?
 ddreams:&#160;?
 Donald_D._Doge: question mark
 ddreams: I guess it's time for you to sleep
 Donald_D._Doge: no u
 geppoz: there is no shadow in inputs...
 rvaldes-: is there a way for us to play the game so we can come up with new things
 AntiSquid: oh my code does that for me, didn't realize @_@ sorry
 JulieTobin: How do you learn to code on here?
 AntiSquid: ya ok, so i compute the current turn's shadows for some reason, why is that code there? lol
 icecream17: sigh, I can't figure out how codingame implements `readline`
 Hoyer: maybe u made it for debug and forgot to remove it
 AntiSquid: maybe, i'll comment it out ... :D
 AntiSquid: JulieTobin well you should know language basics
 AntiSquid: do you know any language?
 Numby: Ok, I put the time to make a somewhat efficient representation of the board, possible actions and simulating. I'm getting 2~5k sims a turn choosing moves randomly. Can anyone point me to something more useful to do with my setup than random?Currently I'm just running a bunch of sims from each possible move until the end, then picking the move which ends up with the most wins
 AntiSquid: include opponent somehow&#160;?
 Enknable: just create an eval function?
 AntiSquid: i think he has an eval already, right? how else does he check best move at the end&#160;?
 Numby: I'm including opponent yeah. WDYM eval. Im just counting number of wins from the end states I got to by chosing random moves for me and my opponent
 Enknable: well you have state information along the way
 Numby: the end state score is 0/1 (lose/win)
 ddreams: look up monte carlo tree search
 AntiSquid: evaluate what you have at the end, suns trees ...
 Numby: I mean sun doesn't really matter at the end though? I just compare my vs opp score and if equal I look at tree count
 ddreams: as long as you count the suns into the score, correct
 Kukiss: I believe the sun counts into the final score.
 Numby: Oh, I hadnt even noticed that
 pmor: And then a tie breaker of # of trees left
 KelvinAndHubbles: how long is the "You reached the limit of plays for the time period" period last again?
 Thundar: Was my bot in Wood I doing placement matches without me submitting my code? I didn't change my code or submit anything yet I just got promoted to bronze
 ZarthaxX: Thundar you can get pushed
 ZarthaxX: people that submit play against your bot or against boss and lower boss score or increment yours
 ZarthaxX: so you end passing
 Numby: These might help since a lot of my sims (esp in the beginning) end up with both me and my opponent not having any actual score. So tie-breakers will matter
 Thundar: Oh, well that's interesting
 Numby: But I think the bigger issue is I have some monte-carlo inspired algo but its not really a MCTS. I think Im missing the tree search part lol
 ddreams: yeah, you want your results to influence your search
 Numby: Yeah I dont really do that atm lol
 Numby: Just random turns start to end ^^
 Enknable: instead of random moves, why not score each move?
 Numby: I wanted to try out sims instead of heuristics this time
 ddreams: the beauty of the monte carlo tree search is that it scores it for you
 Enknable: right
 Enknable: but u can use heuristics to guide your sims choices
 Enknable: unless you store the tree
 Numby: Hmm yeah should do that too prolly next weekend. I really focused on game representation and sim efficiency
 Enknable: &gt;A hybrid approach to MCTS is possible, however. Instead of allowing the random playout to run until the end of the game we can instead terminate the playout early and then apply an evaluation function to the position to determine which side is more likely to win.
 cegprakash: submits stuck wew
 ddreams: you can start by storing the first depth
 cegprakash: it's just 3rd day and already submits stuck
 Smelty: yes
 ddreams: and prefer simulating the winning moves
 Numby: Maybe for end game it's possible to create a simple-ish algorithm to complete your trees/cash out instead of evaluating
 ddreams: the simplest way to do that is just to stop generating seed moves near the end
 Astrobytes: Enknable speaks of EPT variant of MCTS - effective algo
 Numby: Do you guys store the tree in between turns too? Cuz you should be able tore-use your work but might be tricky to account for opponent's move too
 Numby: able to reuse*
 Astrobytes: Depends on your implementation but it should be pretty easy to set your new root to the best node for the next turn
 Smelty: hmmst
 ZarthaxX: ASTRO
 Astrobytes: ZARTHOXYBRO
 AntiSquid: bear
 Astrobytes: Yeah, back to the bear eh
 AntiSquid: it's a bear, i call it a bear, not being racist, just saying it as it is
 Smelty: still dropping ranks...:(
 Astrobytes: It is now a bear, he changed it
 ZarthaxX: blaise demanded the bear
 AntiSquid: fix it, laptop cat
 ZarthaxX: AstroSeed
 ZarthaxX: how is the contest going
 cmfbasketball: hey
 cmfbasketball: this is hard
 cmfbasketball: but fun
 Astrobytes: Can't argue with the Devil Himself I guess :P
 icecream17: ohhh I finally figured out how readline is implemented by codingame: it's implemented by d8
 Astrobytes: Contest shmontest ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: I don't like it, I find it really, really boring
 AntiSquid: i also think it's bad game choice, but i kept trying to improve my bot
 AntiSquid: find it irritating
 Astrobytes: I will write something serious yeah, but it's just soooo boring.
 AntiSquid: even gocoder looked more fun lol
 Astrobytes: lol you know it
 AntiSquid: i hate that one too
 Astrobytes: This one might have been OK as a community multi
 AntiSquid: not fun with if else, not fun with sim for me ... 
 Astrobytes: I would have given it an upvote but probably wouldn't have played it 
 Astrobytes: My sim is almost ready but I just cannot be arsed to finish it.
 orangesnowfox: yeah... Not the best contest I've played
 CyrilMtl: only a big tree can seed&#160;?
 Smelty: nope, all can
 CyrilMtl: oh, thanks.
 AntiSquid: i think i would rather play the King Domino port made by bob, tulips vs daisies ... maybe even try paper soccer, damn actually paper soccer looks fun after trying this contest out
 Smelty: you can seed to a distance equal to your current height
 Astrobytes: Just been fking around with strange if elses casually and talking to a mate, + playing a match 3 game for the past couple of hours if I'm honest
 Recovery_disaster: but the range you can plant a seed depends on the level of the tree
 ZarthaxX: oh pity Astrobytes AntiSquid&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: i also find it not so interestign maybe
 ZarthaxX: hard to do smth
 ZarthaxX: you hit the wall too fast haha
 orangesnowfox: haha... I added the ability to use `SEED` and suddenly m bot gained a whole bunch of rank :v
 AntiSquid: i precomputed shadow casts, expected a massive boost ... but then nothing ~_~
 Astrobytes: Well, write sim. Make fast. Search.
 Astrobytes: No depth
 Astrobytes: to the game
 ZarthaxX: F
 Zenoscave: My Sim is done but I can't for the life of me get a good eval
 ZarthaxX: you think thats the game astro?
 <b>**orangesnowfox remembers Code Royal is a thing</b></p><p><img src="/a/61978887534411" /> AntiSquid: i don't think that is enough astro
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave SAME
 ZarthaxX: it's super hard to find an eval
 Zenoscave: I'm doing 30-40k states a move
 Astrobytes: There are useable heuristics but this is how it will end
 ZarthaxX: a moev?
 ZarthaxX: wot
 Zenoscave: *a turn
 ZarthaxX: oh okey
 ZarthaxX: that doesnt seem like much :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Fix it 
 CyrilMtl: I guess Dormant tree can't seed&#160;?
 CyrilMtl: I guess Dormant tree can't seed&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Yeah I could do better I'm sure but I need eval first
 Smelty: yes
 AntiSquid: i don't include op yet ... not sure how much will change, just wonder what top is doing ... i am barely breaking 1k lol
 orangesnowfox: CyrilMtl, Dormant can't do anything lol
 AntiSquid: i think it's a bit random actually Astrobytes, but i might be wrong
 Astrobytes: CyrilMtl: when you are dormant what are you able to do?
 Smelty: uh oh accidentally submitted
 CyrilMtl: They should implement an NO2 booster option&#160;;)
 Smelty: hmymm
 Astrobytes: -3vel*treeSize
 Astrobytes: I donno AntiSquid. Anyway
 AntiSquid: you know what game also has sun as currency but is actually fun&#160;??
 Smelty: LMAO
 Astrobytes: I'm out for tonight
 AntiSquid: Plants vs Zombies&#160;!
 AntiSquid: good night
 Astrobytes: lol
 Zenoscave: gn Astro
 Smelty: hrrm
 ZarthaxX: gn sweetie
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 AntiSquid: it's a fun game
 Astrobytes: It would be a fun game for fun guys if it was Shrooms vs Zombies
 Astrobytes: .... :door:
 AntiSquid: oh look my improvement might get me 100 extra rans wow ... will be top 900 soon yay .. *false excitement*
 ZarthaxX: depressing squido
 ZarthaxX: im with you on that one tho
 orangesnowfox: Huh I wonder how a NN would do here
 orangesnowfox: Probably terrible xd
 AntiSquid: omg this again 
 orangesnowfox: ... This has already come up like 500x hasn't it
 orangesnowfox: lol
 AntiSquid: no . depends . depends . and it would do amazing if the right approach is taken
 ddreams: ok, I definitely have a bug in the shadow calculation
 ddreams: awesome
 AntiSquid: spent hours bug hunting with this game, ddreams
 ddreams: excited to see how big of a difference it makes when I fix it
 ddreams: found it.. I only cast shadow from a tree bigger, not bigger and equal
 ashiknur: I am in bronze league. How can I go to wood league?
 ddreams: you can't
 ddreams: so that bugfix got me from 1200 to 700
 ddreams: at 50% battles at least
 Zenoscave: How do you balance completing early vs keeping more trees in eval?
 Zenoscave: I can't distribute them evenly it seems
 ddreams: sitting here trying to tweak the same
 stefan-gg: i dont know if this is a bug but apparently i can harvest size 3 tree with this code for some reason
 stefan-gg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5096f48-6644-438b-b3e3-6e9fc81c573f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5096f48-6644-438b-b3e3-6e9fc81c573f</a>
 ZarthaxX: that's the msot problematic part
 ZarthaxX: :D
 stefan-gg: i even have this condition isMine &amp;&amp; size == 0 and somehow size 3 tree is being looked at like it is size 0 kinda
 ddreams: print out the size too then
 ddreams: suprising if size is not 0 in there
 ddreams: you can only harvest size 3 trees though
 stefan-gg: size is 0 but i can harvest it
 stefan-gg: my bad
 ddreams: You can only complete the lifecycle of a size 3 tree
 ddreams: if you try to do an illegal action like that, you'll wait instead
 stefan-gg: yes but i have that condition and in the if statement i have the only complete comand so there is no other complete comand anywhere else
 stefan-gg: and i specified size needs to be 0 but tier 3 tree is still harvested someho
 stefan-gg: somehow*
 stefan-gg: its most likely my mistake but i wondered if somebody had the same problem
 ddreams: print out size inside your statement then
 stefan-gg: it doesnt prints it only does the complete command i just tried out that
 stefan-gg: its like it ignores everything except complete
 ddreams: pretty likely that you're not running the code you think you are
 stefan-gg: im gonna double check that again ty
 orangesnowfox: I forget if depth=8 is "good" for onitama...
 stefan-gg: thats the right code i triple checked that i dont have anything else
 ddreams: so you see your "System.err.println(cellIndex + " nula &lt;- minn");" printout?
 stefan-gg: yes but i dont see it if the tree is size 3
 MoMaT: you can't harvest size 0. there are no complete actions on the list for this size.
 stefan-gg: i know i know
 stefan-gg: but for some reason that is working and it was confusing me
 Enknable: why not just post the paste of the code surrounding your check?
 MoMaT: you have some side effects somwhere.
 MoMaT: check how do you assign and later change cellIndex and minn.
 MoMaT: ah, no, minn is just string...
 stefan-gg: im just confused how is tier 3 tree passing the size == 0 statement im not changing size anywhere
 ddreams: it's almost certainly not
 Enknable: isMine is true too?
 stefan-gg: yes
 MoMaT: maybe you change size to soemthing else before the check.
 ddreams: so print out size somehow
 ddreams: if you can't see your printout, you need to figure out why
 stefan-gg: well thats the problem it doesnt print the size but it does the complete part and tree is harvested
 ddreams: add more prints until you know what's happening
 stefan-gg: ok im gonna try that ty for help guys
 Enknable: wait wait...
 Enknable: you're harvesting a 3 tree?
 stefan-gg: yes it is size 3
 Enknable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1dd05bc7-f6cc-4f32-873e-4d5051f4dc36">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1dd05bc7-f6cc-4f32-873e-4d5051f4dc36</a>
 Enknable: so...what's the point of this snippet?
 Enknable: you should show us the other code where COMPLETE exists
 stefan-gg: im getting 404 error wtf
 MoMaT: we need to see the code before that.
 Enknable: thats where the bug is
 Enknable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5096f48-6644-438b-b3e3-6e9fc81c573f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5096f48-6644-438b-b3e3-6e9fc81c573f</a>
 ddreams: almost certainly size is 0, but cellindex is pointing to a size 3 tree
 Enknable: sorry its just your snippet
 stefan-gg: ok im gonna print the whole code 
 stefan-gg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e2aa254-9573-4e73-965c-a1f4f1354b97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e2aa254-9573-4e73-965c-a1f4f1354b97</a>
 stefan-gg: and i made a map before but thats not the problem
 ddreams: right
 stefan-gg: and everythin else i have is commented i triple checked that
 ddreams: you are printing out several commands per line
 annaproxy: Is there an example input available somewhere for testing locally? Maybe i'm not looking hard enough 
 ddreams: per *round
 MoMaT: still can't where cell index and size are set.
 ddreams: anna, you can print it from the game
 MoMaT: *can't see/
 annaproxy: Yes but I am lazy
 ddreams: then you're screwed, I guess :p
 Zenoscave: no example input is available
 Zenoscave: annaproxy that's the easiest thing to do though
 annaproxy: yeah will do that then
 MoMaT: annaproxy: while True: x = input(), print(x, file=sys.stderr)
 annaproxy: yep
 Enknable: it might be that your size and cellIndex are not related to the same tree
 Enknable: the print double output could be it too tho
 Zenoscave: you can only print one line per turn
 Zenoscave: that's gonna be the issue
 MoMaT: so, @stefan-gg what you got for us? I need a clojure.
 stefan-gg: nothing i dont know what to do to be honest
 ddreams: you are printing out several commands per turn
 ddreams: that's going to be bad
 MoMaT: show us the complete fragment of the code, including the lines where you assign values to your attributes.
 stefan-gg: but if i do this command it wont harvest my tree if(size == 3 &amp;&amp; isMine){
 Zenoscave: do you have 4 sun?
 ddreams: do you get a warning?
 stefan-gg: ok im gonna copy all variables now
 stefan-gg: yes
 Zenoscave: it costs 4 sun to harvest
 stefan-gg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/139fa736-7d69-4107-bfe8-c3db4f2f95ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/139fa736-7d69-4107-bfe8-c3db4f2f95ae</a>
 stefan-gg: int count0 = 0;
 stefan-gg: thoose are my only variables outside of that code i sent before
 MoMaT: ok, but that;s reading input.
 MoMaT: where do you set Cell Index and size?
 stefan-gg:  int cellIndex = in.nextInt(); // location of this tree
 stefan-gg: for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTrees; i++) { it is all set in this for loop which is inside a while true loop
 MoMaT: so you print decision while you're reading the trees? without reading all input first?
 ddreams: print out cellindex and size so you can see if they correspond
 ddreams: but if you use the code you pasted before, you have a huge bug in that you print several commands per turn
 MoMaT: yes, @ddreams is right. you need to read all lines, then print just one.
 stefan-gg: ok, ty for help im doing that rn
 MoMaT: if more than one tree fits the condition, the command will apply to the next turn...
 MoMaT: so at some point there you might not be in the turn you think you are.
 miszu: good evening children
 MoMaT: hey, stefan-gg is older than you! you can't be his father.
 actualCoderTrevor: When silver opens up will the boss be harder than the default ai is now?
 ddreams: could be his father in law though
 ddreams: absolutely yes
 Nerchio: actualCoderTrevor for sure
 miszu: when silver opens?
 actualCoderTrevor: Cool thanks&#160;:)
 miszu: I wonder if my wood 2 code will pass bronze
 actualCoderTrevor: miszu yes it opens tomorrow, right now bronze is the farthest you can advance
 MoMaT: there should be a bot here answering all the question about the league system.
 MoMaT: of only Automaton did his job...
 ddreams: everyone here is a bot except you, momat
 miszu: Negative
 ddreams: ^ just what a bot would say
 ddreams: sneaky sneaky
 MoMaT: ROTFL
 miszu: I see an enemy!
 MoMaT: AUtomaton2000 help, who is a bot here?
 Automaton2000: you know i am talking about
 MoMaT: thanks, that was helpful as always...
 miszu: Automaton2000 who is my father
 Automaton2000: if i had to deal with
 ddreams: automaton2000 are you broken?
 Automaton2000: clash of code with a lot of things
 ddreams: I'll take that as a yes
 MoMaT:&#160;:)
 Hugo-NL: you can do multiple complete in 1 day&#160;?
 ddreams: yes
 MoMaT: if you have energy.
 miszu: I am too lazy to write the engine for the comp
 Hugo-NL: damn
 Hugo-NL: can  you also do multples of other commands as long as you have energy&#160;?
 actualCoderTrevor: Yep every command but wait
 MoMaT: thats' what is meant by "As long as you have enough sun points, you can take any number of actions. "
 ddreams: but only one action per tree
 ddreams: so you can't both grow and complete a tree in a turn
 stefan-gg: but if i do that nothing will happen&#160;? or it will be transfered to another turn&#160;?
 MoMaT: that's never an issue if you use provided list of action. only valid actions are there.
 ddreams: if you do an illegal action you will sleep
 annaproxy: good, I need to go to bed anyway
 stefan-gg: but if i understand correctly if i do multiple commands they will transfer to another turn&#160;?
 ddreams: I think so
 stefan-gg: and if i grow tree i cant harvest it on same turn&#160;?
 ddreams: you probably get a warning about not reading all the input
 ddreams: if you use a tree, it becomes dormant
 actualCoderTrevor: It depends on what you mean. If you output two commands before you get more input than yes, but that's almost certainly not what you want.
 actualCoderTrevor: You get new input for every turn, not just every day
 stefan-gg: what is considered on reading all input i didnt quite understand that part does it mean i have to use all generated variables&#160;?
 actualCoderTrevor: You don't have to use them, just read them from the input stream
 ddreams: ^ so every turn you must read all the input the game gives you, and output a single command
 stefan-gg: oh ok that makes sense now 
 ddreams: to make sure you only print a single command, you can have an action variable and only output it at the end of your while loop
 ddreams: so you only have one System.out.println in your entire program
 stefan-gg: oh that makes sense because i output command in every loop in for loop
 Nezzler_YT: i need help i just started coding
 ddreams: do you have a question too, perhaps?
 Roxxx: Hey guys
 Roxxx: anyone familiar with MySQL?
 ddreams: sure
 Nezzler_YT: no
 Nezzler_YT: :worried:
 CyrilMtl: Quick question, If I seed from a tree size 2, seeded cell must in straight line from the tree ?or is it 2 cells adjacent&#160;?
 ddreams: nothing about straight lines here
 ddreams: 2 cells away in any direction
 skotz: having a difficult time dealing with the c# gc
 KelvinAndHubbles: welp, spent the whole day transferring my python beam search to c++ and went down 100 places&#160;:/ Gonna tweak it, but feelsbad
 ZarthaxX: KelvinAndHubbles  bug prob
 KelvinAndHubbles: well, I mean it also was a language transfer and because c++ instead I could do lower depths without hitting a timeout because python slow, but yeah a bunch of things I need to workout
 KelvinAndHubbles: yeah tho, it doesn't help that sometimes it just decides to not decide on any action, gotta fix that
 NinjaDoggy: everyone doing beamsearch while I'm sitting here with my Monte Carlo(not tree search yet) LMAO
 KelvinAndHubbles: that's fair, my first time doing something in a contest that isn't if else or horribly failing to get a genetic alg to find an optimal solution
 ZarthaxX: lol :rofl:
 NinjaDoggy: nah it's because I think beam search is ass this contest :P
 NinjaDoggy: going to jump directly to MCTS after using MC to verify my game engine works&#160;;)
 FatIvan: Nothing wrong with a little pile of if else.
 FatIvan: Same plan I use every time.
 ZarthaxX: simultaneous mcts?
 NinjaDoggy: yeh simultaneous mcts
 NinjaDoggy: might be busting something out from xmas rush :P
 MoMaT: NinjaDoggy, how do you find this game compared, e.g. to the Ice and Fie, or the RPS Pacman?
 MoMaT: IIRC, you had been using quite creative tactics there. do you see any options for creativity in this game?
 NinjaDoggy: nah nothing super fancy like ice and fire from what I can see
 NinjaDoggy: but I like it more than pacman so far because it's perfect information&#160;:)
 MoMaT: heh, OK, so your are not into predicting the enemy, I see.
 NinjaDoggy: yea I'm more into cool search techniques/pruning :P
 NinjaDoggy: like I was 100% carried by using dijkstra's in CoIF lol
 MoMaT: but is it that cool? once you implemented it for one contest you can just run it on them all. you just need to grind out in experiments, the perfect evaluation function...
 NinjaDoggy: nah like pruning techniques that only apply for the specific game
 NinjaDoggy: like in CoIF dijkstra's could be used to find sick cuts or finding the amount of gold needed to win
 NinjaDoggy: not really applicable in other games at all
 MoMaT: hmmm... I think I prefer multi-agent games, there have more interesting things to do... I don't find the 2 Totoros that much different from 2 Yubabas...
 NinjaDoggy: agreed, which is why I liked CoIF so much :P
 ZarthaxX: idk if xmas rush algo will help here
 ZarthaxX: but good luck  dogo, you always amaze me
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: Once silver drops, my goal for the week is to make a sim and look at least 1 deep :V
 ZarthaxX: excellent goal!
 Lachrymosa: I've never written a sim before uwu
 ZarthaxX: there is always a first time
 Lachrymosa: for a sim, do I need to make EVERY possible move, or can I get away with not doing shadows or something?
 ZarthaxX: you have to sim all the behaviour
 ZarthaxX: but you can do it gradually
 ZarthaxX: like just support seed
 ZarthaxX: or just complete
 ZarthaxX: and so on
 Lachrymosa: that makes sense
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: try doing that
 ZarthaxX: step by step
 Lachrymosa: evaluation is something else too. This game doesn't have instant win/loss so I can't check for that really. Do I try and see if they could make more points than me on any given turn?
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: you can try many things
 ZarthaxX: an eval is an estimate of how good is your actual position
 Javatacos: What does dormant mean in the game.  does it mean that it will collect no sun on the next turn?
 icecream17: it means you can't do anything with a tree until the next turn
 vchapman: It means the tree has done a move that day.
 Javatacos: gotcha.  Thanks
 BrunoFelthes: anyone has a local tester to share?
 icecream17: rank 599, wonder if ill get into silver
 DetoBot: oh my IceCream17 bot has lost places overnight
 icecream17: ooh, deto, you're only 300ish ranks away
 DetoBot: too far 
 DetoBot: way too far
 DetoBot: or too near

 icecream17: yeah i wasted another day trying to implement "readline" so that local tests could work
 BrunoFelthes: is it working for this contest resty-daze?
 icecream17: might also want to look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zeno">https://github.com/LSmith-Zeno</a> scave/SpringChallenge2021
 resty-daze: BrunoFelthes you need modify official ref code according to its readme
 icecream17: (space to avoid ping)
 resty-daze: oh some one already do it 
 icecream17: the guy in the tutorial video is 1317th
 ZVRKK: Hello everyone, do someone knows when the silver league will open&#160;? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: iI've added over 100 lines of code and my arena bot still kicks by ide bots ass
 PatrickMcGinnisII: by=my
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: same
 DetoBot: Number of lines of code&#160;!= Winning Code
 DetoBot: :stuck_out_tongue:
 DetoBot: as if i am having 1000+ lines of code
 DetoBot: and most of them are comments
 DetoBot: sloc ~ 400
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm trying to trim potential commands so when i sim i can look at more nodes ... but its not working
 BrunoFelthes: PatrickMcGinnisII, just click at the "Bronze League" label at the top of the screen, and you will see the date
 BrunoFelthes: ZVRKK ^
 ZVRKK: Thank you BrunoFelthes
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: PatrickMcGinnisII how many nodes can you look at currently? I am thinking about switching to use simulation
 icecream17: patrick, how are you 497th!?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: everything is setup for sim, I'm just only doing 1 complete day at the moment
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: how many different possible turn combinations does that include?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've seen possible moves number in the 60s...i can't have a width of 60
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So I prioritize and eliminate
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I usually come up with 6 patterns, like GGSSW or CGSW etc.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wherre CGSW are the commands
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lots of seed potentials
 PatrickMcGinnisII: grow kinda takes care of itself if you seed correctly
 itzluku: top100! ;D
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: nice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: something as simple as destination idex%2==source index%2 , and i trim that seed move , keeps you from stepping on your own toes, but not from the enemy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So if I have 5 moves i like and then i find 5 moves i like for the enemy, that's depth^25, which still doesn't work for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and then there's the bounces
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so wierd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think using a local sim to give params or train an NN is probably better than what I'm doing now
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: wouldn't it be 25^depth?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: and if you use beam search or something it should be much less right?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it should
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well looking at logs from midgame...out of 40 possible moves i trim it down to 2 grows, 2 seeds ... the combos become GGSSW, GSSW x 2, GGSW x 2,GW x2, SW x2,W  ... still too many combos
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for beam search in my opinion
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: it sounds like other people have had some success with beam search though
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: how are you representing the game state?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, they are pushing cpu cycles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: boards are stored statically 38 ints
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I think some people were using bitboards
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it is, i just never throw them away...i never run out of memory even...it's always a time thing for me
 DetoBot: oh yeah bitboards
 DetoBot: great stuffs
 DetoBot: quite sure why they works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess i'll have to run local to get best params with wider beam for eval, then pray it works on smaller beam on CG.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Some games, i just don't know why i lose
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, check it out DetoBot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/550739379">https://www.codingame.com/replay/550739379</a>
 BrunoFelthes: i have too many heuristic and hyper parameters... It is very hard to tuning

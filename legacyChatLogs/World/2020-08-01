 eulerscheZahl: Happy Caturday
 OmarJabellpo: how can i see the solns for clash of code 
 eulerscheZahl: if others share the code at the end, you can just view it. not everyone shares. there are some bots clashing too. those never share the code
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Allis: eulerscheZahl I read recently that bots share their code if the person they're a ghost of shared; do you know if that claim holds any water?
 dbdr: euler, the expert on all things clash of code :D
 dbdr: Allis, did you fail at stopping clashing?
 Allis: I sure did. :sweat_smile:
 Allis: I realize euler doesn't clash, but they're obviously super-knowledgeable, so I figured they might know anyway.
 dbdr: np, I was just teasing
 eulerscheZahl: on the forum I read something along the lines that CG reconsiders the bots sharing code for CoCI don't know if that caused any changes. In the past bots never shared
 eulerscheZahl: damn you JSI always forget "this"
 dbdr: could you use TS?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: self::
 eulerscheZahl: hm, I guess that would be an option
 eulerscheZahl: but now I'm too deep into it to look around :P
 AndroidTS: hello guys
 dbdr: I dug myself into too deep of a holethe only option left if to keep digging and hope there's an exit on the other side&#160;;)
 dbdr: if-&gt;is
 eulerscheZahl: i'm mostly done with the JS part actually
 dbdr: cool
 eulerscheZahl: i can already see the light on the other end
 eulerscheZahl: and all it cost me is some days and a struct&#160;:(
 dbdr: what happened to struct?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: just disappeared
 eulerscheZahl: last then i saw from him was a :thumbsup: 2 weeks ago
 dbdr: maybe just on and off by period?
 eulerscheZahl: future will tell us
 eulerscheZahl: will he delete the account that just got moderator privileges? :thinking:
 Thyl: Hello&#160;!
 Spaceinvader: hello&#160;! is someone know how is calculated "next_checkpoint_angle"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: struct is on a journey to discover the next hexagonal multiplayer
 jrke: Happy caturday&#160;:)
 jacek: :cat:
 FlatAuntie_c759: ffff
 AntiSquid: hi FlatAuntie_c759
 aCat: :heart_eyes_cat:
 jrke: What is NN i read about it but didn't understood
 MSmits: a neural network is a layered series of values (weights) that, when combined with some mathematical functions can learn patterns that can be used for all sorts of things
 MSmits: your brain works similarly
 jacek: stupid talkchess. a need to use dutch proxy to get there
 inoryy: layers go brrrr
 MSmits: on CG it is used on some multis
 MSmits: inoryy is an expert actually
 MSmits: he does this for a living
 jrke: so it means my bot will learn by that?
 MSmits: the bot learns yes
 MSmits: but it's not obvious anymore what it is "thinking", unlike with a normal bot
 jacek: well 'normal' bot can learn too. its all about weights adjusting
 MSmits: the process is obfuscated by the enormous amounts of weights that are gibberish to us
 jacek: being NN or just feature wieghts
 MSmits: jacek true, but a "normal" bot has the patterns already set and just the importance of them is 'learned"
 MSmits: a NN learns the patterns themselves
 jacek: an NN
 MSmits: your ntuple bot is the perfect example
 MSmits: you decide the patterns, the bot learns how good/bad they are
 MSmits: Robo's bot doesnt have ntuples. Supposedly they are in there somewhere, but who knows
 AntiSquid: there are tools to visualize the learning and how different parts of the NN affect the output
 AntiSquid: it's not 100% blackbox :p
 MSmits: yeah, but the fact that you need tools for that, proves my point :P
 MSmits: it's not 100% no
 jacek: well ntuples are linear, thats thei limitation. also i think ntuples do some work that convolution network do, theyre just handmade and faster to learn
 inoryy: in the wild NNs have shown themselves to be better feature extractors than human experts. That's basically how deep learning era started - with NNs winning competitions historically dominated by classical ML models with features carefully handcrafted by human experts. So it's a bit more than weight adjustment
 MSmits: mathematically it isn't, but conceptually it is, you mean
 AntiSquid: are you aware of numenta inoryy?
 AntiSquid: HTMs and such
 inoryy: MSmits I mean "it's a bit more than weight adjustment on a linear combination of pre-defined features"
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: of course
 AntiSquid: just wanted your opinion on HTMs
 inoryy: AntiSquid not impressed to put it lightly&#160;:) 
 AntiSquid: why is that?
 inoryy: I skimmed the whitepaper by Hawkins et al, it was a bunch of wishful thinking more fitting for /r/futurology than actual science
 AntiSquid: not sure, but probably know what you are referring to, however you got to start somewhere
 jacek: HTM?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://numenta.com/">https://numenta.com/</a>
 inoryy: I'm open to revisit the stance once he publishes something tangible and reproducible in a proper peer-reviewed journal
 MSmits: fair
 MSmits: so that htm stuff is like string theory
 AntiSquid: i think HTM is more like the unifying theory
 MSmits: string theory tries to be that...
 inoryy: i'm way out of my depth here but string theory seemed to have major scientists backing it and working on it through the years
 MSmits: yeah lots
 MSmits: but it's completely theoretical
 inoryy: HTM as it is presented is fringe science at best
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: it's mostly a mathematical framework
 MSmits: that you can fit universes on
 AntiSquid: honestly, best to check it out yourself MSmits
 MSmits: i should learn more about mainstream nn stuff first
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8-ttzWLgXZOGuhUyrPlUuA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8-ttzWLgXZOGuhUyrPlUuA</a>
 MSmits: i want to do TD first though, more helpful for me atm
 AntiSquid: they have regular video talks on the subject
 AntiSquid: it's not as big as the other stuff out there but i wouldn't call it fringe science
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: gtg, visitors soon, ttyl
 jacek: when MSmits gonna figure out TD, we all should run for life
 AntiSquid: TD?
 AntiSquid: tower game?
 AntiSquid: bloody acronyms
 jacek: temporal difference learning
 inoryy: As I said, I'm open to revisit it in the future when he shows tangible proof; by fringe I mean that right now it is not taken seriously in either CNS or ML scientific communities (as opposed to string theory)
 jacek: charArray theory eh
 AntiSquid: i see
 AntiSquid: how's life in London&#160;? any better?
 inoryy: still self-isolating as much as I can; imo Boris opened it soon, cases going up again
 AntiSquid: imo there's too much confusion about what they want to do :Dkeep it shut or keep it open
 inoryy: people aren't taking it seriously; at least in central London parks are full of people sitting basically shoulder to shoulder.&#160;:/
 jacek: im antisocial so im safe
 jacek: cases are rising, and presidential elections were 3 weeks ago. if we could connect the dots..
 Astrobytes: Yeah, couldn't have seen that coming right
 Astrobytes: I've noticed here that the younger the person, the higher the likelihood that they don't give a crap
 Astrobytes: Which is both bizarre and sad
 dbdr: why bizarre?
 Astrobytes: Well, the younger tend to be more environmentally aware etc. more "switched on", yet they act like this.
 dbdr: from a self-interest point of view, it makes sense
 dbdr: environment matters more in the long term, covid more in the short term
 Astrobytes: On the contrary, covid matters a lot in the long term
 dbdr: how?
 dbdr: immunity should go up over time, no?
 Astrobytes: It's completely new. We're only just beginning to find out the post-infection effects for starters. Sure, immunity to one strain.Look at influenza.
 dbdr: sure, we don't know exactly
 Astrobytes: The after-effects of covid seem to be neurological and cardiovascular
 dbdr: for environment we know quite well
 Astrobytes: That's something rather new as far as coronaviruses go 
 Putnam3145: covid-19 is probably going to become a perennial like influenza and colds and things
 jacek: well covid is beneficial for environment
 Putnam3145: i don't look forward to it?
 Putnam3145: swine flu from the pandemic a while back is still around
 Astrobytes: Well yeah, these things don't just bog off once they're finished
 AntiSquid: maybe if the data about covid's influence on the environment gets more attention, there will be more interest in reducing pollution&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Of course not, don't be silly&#160;:(
 dbdr: not sure I follow that logic
 Astrobytes: dbdr the reduction in pollution during covid lockdown was off the scale
 AntiSquid: there was less human activity due to covid, there's data collected to prove this
 dbdr: sure
 AntiSquid: i mean to prove the reduction in pollution
 dbdr: so it shows it's possible?
 Astrobytes: But you can't stop the oil flowing or people lose profits
 AntiSquid: subsidize alternatives a lot more
 AntiSquid: don't pull a trump on the environment
 dbdr: the best alternative is energy use reduction
 AntiSquid: "america first" my ass, it will affect americans too lmao
 dbdr: which indeed must be what happened with lockdown
 Astrobytes: Lots of great solutions, but nothing will be done. Profit first, worry later
 dbdr: as you said, young people care
 Astrobytes: *ideas not solutions
 Astrobytes: World isn't run by young people though
 dbdr: ideas change with generations replacing
 dbdr: not sure it's fast enough though
 Astrobytes: Very slowly. There are always enough of the 'old guard' to keep the dinosaur attitudes alive
 dbdr: until suddenly there isn't&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: We live with some degree of hope, yes&#160;:)
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid:&#160;:)
 code_maniac: How you guys coping up with this pandemic. a sudden shift in lifestyle&#160;?
 Putnam3145: no shift for me
 el19oc: haha yeah, sudden shift in lifestyle...
 Putnam3145: i've been a NEET honing my programming skills for 7 years... okay, that's a lie, I went to college for a while then dropped out because I kept doing personal projects instead of homework
 Putnam3145: which, let me tell you
 Putnam3145: looks way worse on a resume than you might think
 code_maniac: And looking at current situation it seems it's going to be like this unless we have proper vaccine and it's distributions to most of people on world 
 Putnam3145: let us hope that this can happen
 el19oc: wouldn't mind so much if things just stayed like this
 AntiSquid: pandemic doesn't affect me much, i am lucky that's all
 code_maniac: I am using this to learn a lot of things. But at times you just get fade up with this as you don't have people around to meet&#160;:/
 Putnam3145: I would prefer to travel, to be frank
 Putnam3145: I sorta started doing it rather often starting a few years back and now it's just... not an option at all
 AntiSquid: things can't stay like this forever, not sure what the solution is but obviously a lot of people will lose their jobs and the consequences might be really bad, unless there will be some major changes ...
 Putnam3145: I was thinking of going to Brazil but WOW not a good idea right now
 AntiSquid: not good to travel yet ... see brits went on holiday to spain again, a bit early
 el19oc: I mean that seems to be the future we're going down anyway with automation
 el19oc: not sure what the solution is
 code_maniac: Yeah it scares me when i think of people whose job more of physical work based then computers they are going through a crisis. And on top of that if they don't have enough savings they are walking on a sword.
 AntiSquid: going down with automation? i strongly disagree, there's always empty space to fill, it's all about how things are managed
 code_maniac: Definitely we will find out solution to it. But this is a chance to fix lots of unnoticed or unspoken problems of world and societies.  
 code_maniac: Due to this lockdown and all, i do see there's a sudden rise suicide case around world. Including some big celebrities as well. Which again a huge concerning thing as society’s generally don't talk much about mental health 
 el19oc: man I disagree that there's always empty space to fill but I could be wrong
 el19oc: even today it feels like so many jobs exist just for the sake of creating a job, that kind of work doesn't bring any meaning
 AntiSquid: train people so they have the necessary skills then ugh
 AntiSquid: don't force massive student loans on people
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's almost like they make jobs just to keep the general population working all the time eh...Welcome to modern neoliberal economics applied to outdated notions of capitalism
 Putnam3145: yo can i do multithreaded stuff in this
 Astrobytes: nah
 Putnam3145: ah, dang
 Putnam3145: ...what happens if I try?
 Astrobytes: It's multi-core architecture but you only get 1 core
 Astrobytes: Not much, it'll work but you won't get any benefit, or at least very little
 Astrobytes: Many people have tried
 Putnam3145: meh, i'll just write it exactly like I naturally would
 Putnam3145: which, yes, involves a bit of multithreading
 xlr4829: come to clash of CODe i want to kick some code
 KilliKrate: no
 dbdr: Astrobytes: say hi to the boss for me&#160;;)
 ackerman96: ihu
 ackerman96: hi
 Astrobytes: lol dbdr
 Astrobytes: finally!
 dbdr: gz Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: thanks&#160;:)
 dbdr: finally you can chill in your own league again
 Astrobytes: lol
 trictrac: gg Astrobytes a boss only for you&#160;!!
 Astrobytes: thanks trictrac, yeah, lucky me!
 Waffle3z: clash of code chat keeps disappearing, is it supposed to do that
 Astrobytes: Waffle3z, it's a known bug, they've not fixed it yet
 aCat: nice lua code Waffle3z&#160;;-)
 Waffle3z: decay is a pain but it doesn't take a whole lot to move up places, went from around 250th to 32nd in 3 games
 dbdr: what decay?
 Astrobytes: CPs from CoC I think
 dbdr: I know, but it barely decays since the change
 dbdr: super slow
 Astrobytes: Maybe he didn't play for some time
 Waffle3z: long enough to decay from 1st to ~250
 Waffle3z: wow tilde is literally a straight line in this font
 Astrobytes: yeah, bit annoying 
 eulerscheZahl: how is ~ a straight line?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tsc7cp">https://prnt.sc/tsc7cp</a>looks perfectly fine to me

 eulerscheZahl: fix ur fonts
 eulerscheZahl: let's try to define this as a function of browser and operating systemChromium + Ubuntu here
 eulerscheZahl: now we need more userse
 eulerscheZahl: -e
 SPDene: firefox /win 7: look twiddly to me
 eulerscheZahl: win7, wowat least it's not XP anymore
 SPDene: I turned my XP box into an ubuntu one a few months ago :P
 Astrobytes: chrome, win 8.1 (compatibility reasons before someone moans)
 inoryy: chrome, win10
 inoryy: straight line
 SPDene: what font is it? Open Sans Regular for me (twiddly)
 eulerscheZahl: 13 px open sans, lato, sans-serif

 stacked: how do i stop the stupid builtin IDE
 stacked: its doing stupid stuff when i hit enter
 stacked: like removing parentheses
 eulerscheZahl: or suggesting completions.and when you hit ESC to close it, you have to click the IDE again as you lost focus
 stacked: yes its so annoying
 eulerscheZahl: i think we haven't found a solution yet, only CG staff can change that
 Astrobytes: Only solution currently is to use an external idea
 eulerscheZahl: my solution: offline IDE
 Astrobytes: ide
 stacked: tru
 eulerscheZahl: and Astrobytes was faster this time
 Astrobytes: meh, had a typo, doesn't count :P
 eulerscheZahl: and i needed 3 attempts to autocomplete you, too many as.. users online
 Astrobytes: Just kick 'em
 Astrobytes: (kidding)
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Did crystal rush get any new inputs since the contest? My code isn't working now, and it says im not reading all the input&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Hmmmm
 eulerscheZahl: but the message that you aren't reading all inputs is new
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Never happened in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: that warning was added recently
 jacek: and it sucks
 eulerscheZahl: i just compared my contest code with the current arena code. 1:1 the same
 Astrobytes: If you're printing a lot to stderr try disabling it
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Ok...
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Nothing changed
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I can't even read my code now, this is embarrasing
 Astrobytes: Double check you're not missing anything
 Astrobytes: But it does happen randomly sometimes. I hate it.
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I checked all the inputs... I'm not missing anything
 Astrobytes: Stand up, turn around 3 times, clap your hands and say "neigh". Sit back down, check it again.
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: :o
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: No thx
 Astrobytes: Your loss.
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: :rolling_eyes:
 Astrobytes: Seriously though, try silly things like putting your methods in a different order etc. Like if you have something that writes before something that reads, swap them. Sometimes works 
 Astrobytes: (reads/writes from/to stdin/stdout that is)
 dbdr: Astrobytes, ready for some company?
 Astrobytes: at last!&#160;:)
 dbdr: long hours?
 Astrobytes: Actually been taking a wee break from it for a bit!
 BrokenSamourai_d25f: Anyone got the solution for THE LUCKY NUMBER - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-lucky-number/">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-lucky-number/</a>&#160;?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I just reached top 2% of bot programming leaderboard!
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: :D
 Astrobytes: gg MCU
 dbdr: maybe I spoke too soon :D
 Astrobytes: BrokenSamourai_d25f Interview question right?
 Astrobytes: dbdr: I honestly feel that pain
 dbdr: ah, need to implement Ko rule
 eulerscheZahl: mthree right?
 dbdr: most of my loses seem to be Ko violations, which I knew I skipped
 BrokenSamourai_d25f: Yeah interview question, I've finished it but didn't get it fully right though. Curious to know how it's solved
 eulerscheZahl: wrong answer or too slow?
 BrokenSamourai_d25f: Too slow
 BrokenSamourai_d25f: Maybe needs to use some searching algorithm?
 eulerscheZahl: some observations so you can count multiple numbers without testing each of them individually
 BrokenSamourai_d25f: I don't get it&#160;:( 
 eulerscheZahl: how many lucky numbers are there in the range from 600 to 699?
 eulerscheZahl: there are 100 numbers in total. but some contain an 8 and are not lucky
 YurkovAS: dbdr is not secret - what algo you use in Search Race?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Every number except with an 8... so that's 100-10-9
 eulerscheZahl: we have 2 digits to assign and 9 candidates each (012345679), so 9^2 = 81
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: = 81
 dbdr: SA
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Oh
 eulerscheZahl: great EEEEEEEEEEEEE
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I used a diff method
 eulerscheZahl: but same result
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: mhm
 YurkovAS: dbdr thanks
 dbdr: offline
 eulerscheZahl: and that's a simple example how to count ranges and not individual numbers. for the given puzzle you'll need some more observations and not forget a corner case
 eulerscheZahl: only because illedan couldn't upload 500 validators :rofl:
 BrokenSamourai_d25f: Ohhhh right, now I get it. Thanks, that gave me a direction 
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I seem to time out on that puzzle
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Maybe cus im looping through every number...
 Astrobytes: that's more like it dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:)
 dbdr: ko implemented
 dbdr: I still have one rule error, it seems, but rare
 dbdr: the boss plays a move that I think is illegal, so I crash
 Astrobytes: ah you mistake it for a suicide
 dbdr: probably
 dbdr: no, for a ko
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 MSmits: hey guys, question. Can people still use bash system calls in code golf or is this completely disabled?
 dbdr: ko makes dbdr go go KO
 eulerscheZahl: still possible
 MSmits: i guess that explains some of my problems with getting a reasonable golf score I guess&#160;:)
 dbdr: it does not matter in popular languages
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i do it the other way: calling python from bashbut i think the opposite still holds
 dbdr: except for the top scores
 MSmits: it's never worth it to call bash from python?
 dbdr: so you can get a decent score without it
 eulerscheZahl: it is when you suck at bash
 MSmits: no i mean, for the perfect score
 dbdr: I have perfect scores without system calls
 eulerscheZahl: then it's most likely a bad idea
 eulerscheZahl: and thor goes north now :scream:
 MSmits: dbdr on the shortest languages only I guess?
 Astrobytes: The North remembered
 dbdr: I can check
 MSmits: perl/ruby etc.?
 eulerscheZahl: he got beaten by a system call in C#
 MSmits: yeah but C# is real bad for golfing
 eulerscheZahl: it was never designed for that purpose
 dbdr: well, second in JS, but it's worth 200 points
 dbdr: 199 points in C#
 MSmits: hmm ok
 dbdr: 199 in Java
 dbdr: 200 in python
 dbdr: all those without system
 MSmits: python 200 on each puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: hardcoding for testcases?
 dbdr: 199 in ruby
 dbdr: each puzzle?
 MSmits: is that worth it anywhere eulerscheZahl?
 MSmits: yeah, temperatures, chuck norris etc.
 MSmits: there;s 4 right
 eulerscheZahl: what is "that"?
 dbdr: you were asking about thor
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: golfing in general
 eulerscheZahl: i talked about thor going north
 trictrac: gg dbdr, now 13x13
 Counterbalance: for thor hardcoding was worth it (for me at least)
 MSmits: yeah i was not trying to follow your discussion, i am just breaking into it for my own purposes :P
 dbdr: sorry, misread
 dbdr: thanks trictrac :D
 eulerscheZahl: even with the new testcases added?
 Counterbalance: i had to revert to 2x larger code&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Counterbalance: but i'm guessing that S is now N so hardocing might still be possible
 MSmits: I got 77 characters on thor, best is 53
 MSmits: python that is
 Counterbalance: I have no idea how anyone can get to 46 chars..
 eulerscheZahl: 117&#160;:/
 MSmits: wait no thats temperatures sorry
 MSmits: 77 in temperatures&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 75 :P
 AntiSquid: did thor code golf change or what
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: other validators
 Counterbalance: 43 :D  (top is 29 - that's just magic)
 MSmits: I'm just trying to get that top 2% for quest map
 Astrobytes: ah I never noticed you were nr 1 in golf dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: golf+optim
 dbdr: golf*optim&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: nice
 MSmits: how did you get good at the code golf thing. Did you practice this before CG even dbdr?
 MSmits: I know it's a whole scene outside of CG also
 dbdr: never done before
 MSmits: oh ok
 dbdr: golfing tips $language
 MSmits: yeah you can find a lot of stuff I guess
 MSmits: read some of those
 MSmits: not motivated enough to get anywhere as good as some 
 MSmits: just want a decent score
 eulerscheZahl: the top2%
 dbdr: start by having 5 submissions in popular laguages
 MSmits: right, that at least
 dbdr: should be easy to get about 100 poitns in each, no?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, 5 average scores is easier than 1 top score
 MSmits: which languages do you suggest?
 dbdr: C# Java C++ Python JS
 eulerscheZahl: java, c#, python
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: are scores lineair with rank? Or is it like multi where you get very few points halfway up the board
 dbdr: same exponential
 MSmits: not that easy to get 100 points then
 dbdr: but also same distribution
 dbdr: not hard to be in top 10%
 MSmits: pretty hard for me
 MSmits: well i guess i can do it if i do 1 of those in an afternoon and spend a lot of time searching
 dbdr: you do (almost) have that
 dbdr: for the 2 languages you did in temps
 MSmits: yeah but i spent quite a lot of time on that
 dbdr: not enjoying it?
 eulerscheZahl: golfing replays is more fun
 MSmits: well it's relative i guess, i spend a lot of time on multis and enjoying it more 
 MSmits: it's not bad... just less fun than other  things on CG
 dbdr: right, it's a different mood
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: the nice thing about golf is, you can spend 1 hour and get good results
 dbdr: or even less
 MSmits: get some at least, the startup time is lower
 dbdr: for a new language, or improve an existing solution
 MSmits: right
 dbdr: it's more self-contained than a multi
 dbdr: shorter session
 MSmits: yeah
 x-N0: &lt; 
 dbdr: the tips help a lot, really
 x-N0: &lt; 3
 MSmits: they do
 dbdr: you need both
 Astrobytes: gg dbdr!
 dbdr: thanks. was just visiting D
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: what kind of bots do you guys use for Go?
 MSmits: mcts with eval?
 Astrobytes: hehehe, I'll work on it again tomorrow
 jacek: apparently not only I have this problem <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=74393">http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=74393</a>
 dbdr: greedy
 MSmits: ah
 dbdr: depth 1
 Astrobytes: No search yet
 jacek: for go? minimax of course! why would anyone bother with mcts for go?
 dbdr: my sim is not even fully correct, but close
 dbdr: jacek :grimacing:
 dbdr: dead end
 MSmits: lol
 darkhorse64: MSmits:look for published puzzle solutions . There is a lot to learn
 dbdr: Astrobytes, your no search is not a kind of depth 1?
 Astrobytes: Nope
 x-N0: &lt; 3&#160;; )
 dbdr: what then?
 MSmits: i did darkhorse64. Not really stuck or anything. Just surprised by the insanely short solutions others find, even when I think I did pretty well
 Astrobytes: Just evaluating moves based on some criteria
 dbdr: that just means choosing among some options
 dbdr: that's depth 1 to me
 Astrobytes: No, I don't simulate the moves
 dbdr: qdepth 1&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I was trying to get out of writing a sim until I got here
 dbdr: or rather, greedy qvalue
 darkhorse64: I have improved mine over the course o several months
 MSmits: the hard part is figuring out what is captured right?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: darkhorse64 you mean golf?
 darkhorse64: yep
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: makes sens
 MSmits: I'm just expecting too much success over a short period of time then&#160;:)
 dbdr: MSmits yes, mostly
 dbdr: not especially hard, but has to be done
 MSmits: sounds similar to figuring out for disks in othello whether they are stable or not
 dbdr: yes, like real golf, you need to practice for years&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: right now, I am struggling with Coc quests. As expected, I am slow and missing some Python idioms
 MSmits: I was doing ok in clash, but not winning many
 MSmits: 2nd/3rd mostly
 aCat: darkhorse64 I just finished CoC questline today :D
 aCat: Want a hint on 1st 3 times in a row?
 MSmits: yeah i know it
 MSmits: just start it fast
 trictrac: dbdr welcome 19x19&#160;! now it will be as for othello&#160;?
 x-N0: Hey, this is strange, since the chat is activated I'm getting a request timeout from the server.
 aCat: no
 darkhorse64: 3 in a row and reaching top 1000 look out of reach for me. Yes please
 dbdr: when opponent plays out of the 13x13 board, I crash because that's an invalid move :D
 x-N0: It is just me?
 aCat: a real one
 MSmits: darkhorse64 top 1000 seemed easy?
 dbdr: trictrac no, not planning to try this one hard right now
 MSmits: you dont need to win to improve rating
 aCat: top 1000 is surprisingly easy
 x-N0: :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: 3 in a row is harder
 dbdr: I mostly wanted to get to the top league to have the full rules
 aCat: but i got trick for this :D
 dbdr: do you have something advanced, trictrac?
 darkhorse64: MSmits: not at all. I am stuck at 1600
 aCat: got me 3 clashes to get 3 in a row ;p
 MSmits: darkhorse64 how stuck?
 trictrac: only an alphabeta depth 2
 MSmits: how many games at 1600?
 MSmits: it might slow down a bit
 darkhorse64: MSmits: unable to improve over this ranking
 MSmits: hmm ok
 dbdr: hardcoded depth 2?
 dbdr: minimax will fall over with branching without pruning
 darkhorse64: aCat: what's your trick&#160;?
 MSmits: darkhorse64 which do you win/lose? 
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: Will you play Atari Go soon?
 MSmits: shortest/fastest/reverse?
 trictrac: no adaptative but branching factor is huge and it is mostly 2
 dbdr: yeah
 darkhorse64: shortest is easier for me, I suck at others
 MSmits: I do a little better at reverse I think
 aCat: darkhorse64 join a clash as a first player - when noone is there.and probably the first one who will join be a botthen quickly lunch clash
 MSmits: but shortest/fastest are meh
 aCat: you will have 2 players against one which gives random solution so is mostly wery weak
 aCat: you won't affect your rating very much
 aCat: bot winning is relatively easy
 aCat: :proud-cat:
 MSmits: not a good way to get top 1000 though
 MSmits: but yeah for 3 in a row
 MSmits: darkhorse64 best solution for you is gonna take a lot of time
 darkhorse64: I gain quite a lot of experience with golf for shortest. Google helps also a lot
 dbdr: some bots are relatively good
 MSmits: make a library of clashes
 MSmits: after 100-200 clashes, you'll see repeats proly
 dbdr: the hardest clashes are the first 2000
 dbdr: then it gets easier
 aCat: ...
 MSmits: lol
 aCat: 500
 aCat: and I'm done
 FLQ4: how do i print vars in python 
 darkhorse64: 80 atm for me
 aCat: maybe not forever, but close to eternity
 MSmits: print("vars")
 FLQ4: i am trying to solve a shortest problem 
 FLQ4: no 
 FLQ4: i mean like 
 FLQ4: print(mx, mn) 
 MSmits: thats how
 MSmits: you figured it out
 FLQ4: k thanks self 
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: :duck:
 darkhorse64: Does the Coc quest unlock smth&#160;? I have already won two levels and I probably should spend my time on bots
 aCat: no other path to unlock
 aCat: just xp
 aCat: nooo
 aCat: sorry
 darkhorse64: Why sorry&#160;?
 aCat: "contribution" path after 4th
 Astrobytes: why is that blocked by clashes?
 aCat: it was so long ago i didn't notice
 aCat: no damn idea 
 darkhorse64: Got it because I completed all other quests
 Astrobytes: Doesn't seem sensible
 aCat: probably because 90% of contributions are damn clashes
 MSmits: true, but they arent hard clash quests I think
 darkhorse64: hacker/god path are still projects&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yeah aCat, yeah darkhorse64
 aCat: hacker path?
 Astrobytes: yep, will be added at some point apparently
 Astrobytes: with SEcret Things
 darkhorse64: The rest has been easy: I only wrote a new version for CoTR, the rest was click and collect
 aCat: I'm stuck at marslander
 MSmits: i did all cotr validators by hand :P
 aCat: and puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: I had to do some optim, some golf and a puzzle
 MSmits: also have some default code, but its crap
 aCat: other fully done
 darkhorse64: This week puzzle is quite easy
 aCat: I know
 darkhorse64: ML is a lot harder
 aCat: when is the change - monday?
 Astrobytes: Still the Sudoku one?
 aCat: ML I wanted to tackle from years
 aCat: yep
 darkhorse64: Yes and yes
 JBM: the sudoku one's not that bad
 MSmits: dbdr after you said beam search for cotr I had a real real hard time resisting starting one. After you said it, it suddenly seemed easy
 MSmits: couldnt get it out of my head
 aCat: BTW - let someone finally approve myy contribution :crying_cat_face:
 Astrobytes: Ah I've not written anything for it yet
 aCat: MSmits darkhorse64 new optim is intown
 eulerscheZahl: be patient aCat
 MSmits: which one is that?
 aCat: cats are not patient :D
 eulerscheZahl: better a careful review than a rushed approval
 eulerscheZahl: same game, optim
 Astrobytes: Like a certain Radek... :P
 MSmits: top of my list is currently breakthrough, which is also his
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52286850570a02e25f12d5b1b9a30bdb954c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52286850570a02e25f12d5b1b9a30bdb954c</a>
 darkhorse64: you gain XP while waiting
 aCat: true
 MSmits: oh i thought you said it was darkhorse64's optim
 eulerscheZahl: i guess that's the whole point of the troll castle game
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: it's a troll contrib
 Astrobytes: Farmer JBM
 aCat: make fake accounts and give approves to yourself :P
 eulerscheZahl: 87 upvotes so far
 eulerscheZahl: the contributions with the most is space maze with 88
 MSmits: looks cool aCat
 cegprakash: hi
 aCat: *upvotes
 aCat: thanks
 JBM: hey i'm noe the one who synchronized the quest thing with my reluctance to pass the finish line
 aCat: more will be comeing
 Astrobytes: A wild cegprakash appears!
 cegprakash: does anyone remember me
 aCat: new AI4Games with grant new cg-based lab classes
 MSmits: i cannot forget, no matter how hard I try
 darkhorse64: We all do
 MSmits: :P
 JBM: who's that
 cegprakash: what's hot these days
 cegprakash: been long time I was away
 Astrobytes: The sun mostly
 cegprakash: I mean in Codingame
 darkhorse64: and quests
 Astrobytes: Yeah, check your homepage
 Astrobytes: And try not to give us a running commentary :P
 cegprakash: oh no
 cegprakash: XP introduction
 cegprakash: let me try
 darkhorse64: It will take you busy for a while
 cegprakash: wow I got 10 xp just for clicking
 cegprakash: looks like easy
 darkhorse64: 4K+ XP waiting for you
 eulerscheZahl: close to 5k even
 cegprakash: I'm doing a dfs with my mouse
 MSmits: good one
 eulerscheZahl: i did a BFS to fill the waiting time for the next quest to reveal
 MSmits: efficient
 MSmits: anyone do A*?
 MSmits: not me though, I did a random walk
 darkhorse64: I did, Coc Path is costly
 Astrobytes: ^
 JBM: optim is
 Waffle3z: I still haven't done the mars lander 2
 JBM: coc was free
 MSmits: optim is hardest for me yeah
 JBM: and elitist
 MSmits: is mars lander 2 part of quest path?
 JBM: almost
 JBM: ml-opt is
 cegprakash: I completed only 1 quest
 cegprakash:&#160;:\
 cegprakash: AI quest
 MSmits: oh crap
 Astrobytes: Fix it ceg
 MSmits: thats gonna be hard for me, marslander optim that is
 MSmits: doesnt that need ga?
 JBM: i just picked up the first github hit
 JBM: you don't need a good score
 JBM: just pass it
 MSmits: i guess so
 MSmits: hmm, that might be a good way to pick up a GA example to learn from
 cegprakash: COC is the toughest quest?
 MSmits: not for you
 JBM: i tried that months ago
 JBM: didn't work out, but i did get some cool pix out of it
 MSmits: are you still talking about marslander?
 JBM: yes
 MSmits: hmm ok
 darkhorse64: The good thing with GA for ML is that you strike three birds ith one stone
 darkhorse64: *with*
 MSmits: which 3 birds?
 JBM: which would that be?
 MSmits: also why the animal cruelty
 darkhorse64: ML2,ML3, ML optim
 Astrobytes: !banned for cruelty
 MSmits: ah i already solved ml2
 JBM: opt and 2 ok
 MSmits: with heuristics
 JBM: i'm not quite sure that would pass 3 directly
 JBM: then you're all set
 JBM: just submit that and mve on
 MSmits: why am i set?
 MSmits: dont i need a minimum score?
 JBM: mo
 JBM: well
 JBM: 100%
 MSmits: oh, then I'm done!
 JBM: but no other score
 MSmits: I even got the achiev
 MSmits: for least fuel somewhere
 MSmits: below some value fuel
 JBM: that may be ml1
 MSmits: dont remember exactly
 eulerscheZahl: 300 fuel left
 MSmits: no i think also for ml2
 darkhorse64: Yeah, you get some more feathers
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: from the birds?
 Waffle3z: I need 10 more achievements for the 100 achievements
 Astrobytes: Go forth and achieve!
 JBM: just don't overachieve
 dbdr: achieve is a PL?
 eulerscheZahl: write some forum posts and collect likes
 Waffle3z: pretty sure I already did that
 JBM: that's still an achievement?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Waffle3z: where can I see what the achievements are
 Astrobytes: Farm some language achievements perhaps
 eulerscheZahl: 5 even i think
 dbdr: invite 100 people
 darkhorse64: I even solve ML1 with my GA adapted to a one dimensional problem, 321 fuel left
 JBM: only 20
 JBM: (which is enough of a pain)
 JBM: ml1-opt is closed-form
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: i'm pretty sure ml2 too actually, just hairier
 JBM: (with real continuous physics)
 Astrobytes: Wig Lander 2
 Astrobytes: Good optim game idea. Land the wig on the moving owner.
 JBM: bald trolls of the world unite
 Astrobytes: Bald Troll Lander
 Astrobytes: Mars Lander 4 - Mars Attacks!: Land Mars on the spaceship.
 MSmits: is it that time of night again
 Astrobytes: Sorry.
 MSmits: usually we start after euler went to bed
 Astrobytes: :D
 cegprakash: code vs zombies prob statement too long
 Astrobytes: Oh how we missed you cegprakash
 MSmits: cegprakash does this mean you're going to do all the things wrong that are explained in the statement and then complain to us about it?
 MSmits: just wondering, it's ok either way
 Illedan: lol
 Astrobytes: Hey Illedan, moved OK?
 Illedan: Still 20 boxes to unpack&#160;:(
 Illedan: and no internett
 jacek: hmm there was paper about training neural network the game rules
 Astrobytes: Ah, it'll be done soon enough
 MSmits: yes this is an improvement over alpha zero
 MSmits: mu zero
 Illedan: Yeah, we will get there&#160;:)
 jacek: what if we spam submit bots for it to learn the game rules? no need to read the statement then
 Illedan: I'll set up my office tomorrow and pretend I have perfect internet for a week
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: jacek that is cegprakash actual strategy
 jacek: way ahead of us
 Astrobytes: Ceg Learning
 MSmits: Illedan you mean to avoid having to read mail?
 Illedan: I can still go to work :P
 Illedan: Just double the bicycle distance
 Illedan: 15 km
 Illedan: -.-
 MSmits: mmh, electric I'd say
 Astrobytes: Ah that's not too bad, except at hometime
 Illedan: Downhill to work
 Astrobytes: Ah jeez
 Illedan: which makes the way home a pain :D
 MSmits: yeah life goes downhill when at work
 <b>**MSmits agrees</b></p><p><img src="/a/10550602859943" /> cegprakash: u guys still making cegA jokes?
 MSmits: we stopped a bit cegprakash
 MSmits: but then you came back
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: it's because we love you
 Astrobytes: Really.
 MSmits: it's because some of us love you
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: think maybe I found a mistake or two 30 plies deep in oware :P
 MSmits: by robo's bot
 MSmits: that bot is crazy good
 Astrobytes: Oh I forgot you were still running that
 JBM: what's a cega koje?
 JBM: something to do with sega?
 MSmits: it's starting to show +2 seeds as expected endgame value after 30 plies deep, which means he made a mistake somewhere I think
 jacek: imagine how many crypto he would mine in this time
 MSmits: also with cg bench he loses games now if i add the book
 Astrobytes: May god have mercy on that leaderboard
 MSmits: nahh, it's a lot of work trying to counter 5 nn's from p1 and p2 perspective. Will be a while
 MSmits: but doable 
 jacek: 5 nns?
 MSmits: yours isnt a nn?
 jacek: robo agad recurs me, thats 4
 MSmits: maybe i need to count better
 MSmits: it's 4
 jacek: i should put that in my book
 MSmits: what
 jacek: your mistake
 MSmits: sure, you have a book of my mistakes?
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 jacek: too big for code limit
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: :fire:
 MSmits: ye nice burn
 MSmits: I also have a meta mcts running for othello btw
 MSmits: but it converges very poorly
 MSmits: took 2 days to even show which 1 of the 3 choices on ply 2 are bad
 jacek: and you take symmetries into account
 MSmits: it does eventually give the same best moves as the ntest opening book, but takes a looooong time
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: even player symmetry
 MSmits: player 1 and player 2 can have the same gamestate
 MSmits: due to pass turns
 Astrobytes: 2 days!
 MSmits: so a node may be a p1 node yet also a p2 node
 Astrobytes: Get that running on multiple threads
 MSmits: nah I'm ok with it being slow, I like the observe the process&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Masochist :D
 MSmits: btw, my live bot, actually follows ntest very closely
 MSmits: one game i saw 16 plies in, my bot still followed ntest book, while jacek deviated 3 times
 MSmits: but my meta mcts has a hard time getting there
 MSmits: probably because it takes 10k games or so until the "exploration" effect wears off
 MSmits: from a certain node
 jacek: i like deviations
 MSmits: yeah who knows, maybe they arent bad
 Astrobytes: jacek the deviant
 MSmits: :grin:
 jacek: it sucks to do more learning at this point
 MSmits: how so?
 jacek: i can overfit my bot to 3-ply and win against 3-ply by 60% but it will be weaker i general
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: why does dbd r's bot beat yours?
 MSmits: is it the probcut?
 MSmits: you can get quite deep with that
 jacek: dbd uses multi probcut and he has 300k wieghts
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: i use best first and can get deep also, but more blindly
 MSmits: my best version against him still wins 40%, I have by far a harder time vs you
 MSmits: so maybe his bot is not actually stronger than yours
 MSmits: but its rps
 jacek: so you have the power to pull him down
 MSmits: yeah with submit spam
 MSmits: assuming that what i do through cg bench is the same what happens on submit
 MSmits: not sure how his compiled version submit thingy works
 MSmits: this is one example
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d7f1b06-7c80-4d42-a982-7ad6263a4f64">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d7f1b06-7c80-4d42-a982-7ad6263a4f64</a>

 MSmits: another, somewhat better vs you
 jacek: 2 crashes? their?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: very rare
 MSmits: 1 in 100 or so
 MSmits: i have them too
 MSmits: and you do too
 trictrac: Msmits you need to take in account that rust is not released compiled in CG bench So db dr bot is not @ his max
 MSmits: I'm not sure trictrac, he sent a compiled version
 MSmits: so it should be the same&#160;?
 trictrac: Perhaps i make a mistake but when i try online it's the case
 MSmits: he compiled locally and then submitted it
 MSmits: it plays worse in IDE&#160;?
 trictrac: yes It seems
 MSmits: did you try for Othello too?
 MSmits: or in other games?
 trictrac: in other games
 MSmits: dbdr said he did it differently for othello
 Waffle3z: got to 100 achievements by spamming onboarding with different language solutions
 MSmits: to give us a chance to test in cg bench
 MSmits: he compiled locally and then submitted
 MSmits: so all optimizations should work?
 trictrac: ok good news 
 trictrac: we have the real power in cg bench
 MSmits: yeah, but only because he lets us do that
 jacek: he compiled to fit his 300k weights, not for out convinience
 MSmits: it's nice
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: jacek destroying my faith in humanity once again
 MSmits: that deviant
 trictrac: how to put 300 k weights in 100Ko of code&#160;!?
 MSmits: packing
 MSmits: he said they pack well
 MSmits: btw trictrac, you added an opening book right?
 MSmits: was it ntest?
 MSmits: or just a few moves?
 trictrac: a very small one
 MSmits: ah like yavalath?
 MSmits: your yavalath book is very tiny
 trictrac: yes very small
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: it would be real easy for me to use ntest to hardcode moves 
 MSmits: but i want to use my own program&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's fun
 jacek: where did you get ntest book? i think i got one, but its in weird format
 MSmits: oh actually i dont mean the data, i just mean their program. 
 MSmits: your bots are super deterministic i bet... so i can just follow the choices you make and let ntest counter them, hardcode that and win
 MSmits: but not gonna do it
 jacek: ahh if just something like that existed for oware...
 MSmits: much harder, your bots make very very few mistakes and most of them will be trained not to make their mistakes early game
 Astrobytes: maybe MSmits will publish it :P
 MSmits: if you train a bot, the opening game occurs more than the mid or late game
 MSmits: so it will be best there, is my theory
 jacek: one of my method is to train from the end
 MSmits: but there are many ends
 MSmits: and there is only 1 opening
 MSmits: and because so many moves are bad and the branching is on average 5, you get a very deterministic, almost perfect 20-30 first plies
 MSmits: so it's hard to write a hardcoded book for this
 MSmits: because you need to go very deep to find the mistakes
 MSmits: it can go 200 turns...
 jacek: at the beginning i have random eval, but with 8 ply minimax i can have 8 plies perfect endgames, so i save those positions. then haveing endgame eval, i save and train earlier positions and so on
 MSmits: hmm but why not just calculate a 6 seed endgame book?
 MSmits: i mean calculate, not put it in codesize
 jacek: im too dumb for that
 MSmits: doubt that :P
 jacek: but i use this method for all stages. just play gazillion games to get endgames, then to get pre endgames and so on up to the beginning
 MSmits: sounds good
 MSmits: is this common? Or your own recipe?
 jacek: my own but i bet it was tried somewhere before
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: the other method i used to train bigger net is to generate random games, let my best bot evaluate each position for some plies, then match bigger net to those eval
 MSmits: as for a hardcoded book. Even if I can find a mistake at ply 30 by your bot or Robos that guarantees me +1 or +2 seeds, I still have to play flawlessly, possibly to turn 200. 
 MSmits: well nearly so
 jacek: so i.e. the 0ply eval would more resemble the 2ply search
 MSmits: sounds complicated
 cegprakash: oh I got an idea for code vs zombies
 jacek: its quite simple. and apparently this is new kink in chess community
 cegprakash: I didn't read the statement
 jacek: stockfish nnue uses something similar
 cegprakash: I printed random x y
 cegprakash: then figured out the game
 MSmits: ah I see
 jacek: ceg are you good with reverse mode clash?
 cegprakash: nope
 cegprakash: I am bad at any clash in general
 cegprakash: reverse mode I suck even more
 cegprakash: shortest is what I'm worst at
 Waffle3z: did you have a reverse mode problem
 jacek: but you reversed the code vs zombies
 cegprakash: I see what's happening.. that's not reverse mode like jacek
 cegprakash: in reverse mode I only see wrong
 cegprakash: but here I see what's wrong
 cegprakash: I found that zombie can never eat me
 cegprakash: it can only eat humans
 cegprakash: and I just have to save the human that I like
 cegprakash: and let others die
 cegprakash: like Trump
 cegprakash: it's as simple
 AntiSquid: ceg i think you could become president of the US if you wanted to
 <b>**JBM awaits the punchline</b></p><p><img src="/a/44990769450746" /> AntiSquid: was an honest opinion. no further comments
 cegprakash: oh shit I lost in split second reflex
 Astrobytes: aww
 cegprakash: i got another idea
 cegprakash: i need to do minimax
 Astrobytes: Here we go
 AntiSquid: minimax in clash of code?
 JBM: hey why not
 AntiSquid: i am no expert in clash, i am really bad at it, but minimax in there doesn't make any sense @_@
 JBM: why wouldn't it?
 AntiSquid: those are meant to be quick to solve puzzles 
 cegprakash: no code vs zombies is first step in optimisation
 JBM: minimax is hardly an advanced alg
 cegprakash: I thought greedy would work as it's the first problem
 cegprakash: or wait
 cegprakash: I think greedy can work
 cegprakash: with some precomputation
 AntiSquid: it's advanced for clash puzzles
 AntiSquid: can't think of a clash puzzle where you'd need it
 Astrobytes: he's doing CvZ tho'
 cegprakash: I once did GA in a clash
 Astrobytes: ofc you did
 cegprakash: I was streaming
 Astrobytes: With your prune array
 cegprakash: no
 JBM: plum array?
 Astrobytes: Much drier
 cegprakash: it was some float search with accuracy of 4 decimal places
 cegprakash: and answer lies between 0 and 100
 AntiSquid: well i heard a story of someone doing a NN for fizzbuzz in an interview, sure you can say "why not" but you know why not
 cegprakash: so I did 0 to 100 with a +0.0001 iteration
 cegprakash: loop
 cegprakash: and searched for answer
 Astrobytes:  ...
 cegprakash: it was a math problem
 AntiSquid: iteration loop is an oxymoron 
 cegprakash: not exactly GA but a search
 Astrobytes: Welcome back ceg, welcome back
 cegprakash: :D
 MSmits: it is said that if you say something often enough, you will believe it
 Astrobytes: "I looked in my pocket for the solution, wasn't a NN but I searched"
 AntiSquid: it was a gradient descent loop 
 Counterbalance: tautology, not oxymoron
 MSmits: yeah, tautology
 Putnam3145: redundancy more like
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: :P
 JBM: oxymoron not tautology
 AntiSquid: indeed tautology ... was relying on you Automaton2000 to correct my mistake, thought you were my friend
 Automaton2000: i think it was just a joke
 Counterbalance: lol
 Astrobytes: Actually yeah, since an iteration is not necessarily a loop
 MSmits: he thought you were kidding
 MSmits: thats how stupid it was :Pp
 MSmits: :P
 AntiSquid: friendship is no joke Automaton2000
 Astrobytes: well played A2000
 Automaton2000: i want you to get the score
 Putnam3145: if you look at machine code that isn't aggressively optimized for speed you will find that even known-at-compile-time for loops are still loops
 Astrobytes: Thank you for that informative nugget
 MSmits: lemme go look at some machine code, because that is some powerful statement
 cegprakash: did anyone finish code vs zombies with less deaths?
 Putnam3145: "aggressively optimized for speed" here meaning e.g.
 cegprakash: is there a mode like that
 Putnam3145: -O2 vs -O3
 AntiSquid: Putnam3145 cheers, please get an avatar and welcome to the CG community
 MSmits: cegprakash nope you just get more points if more humans live
 Astrobytes: He does AntiSquid
 Galaxy_001: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org/</a>
 JBM: yes, welcome
 cegprakash: oh damn
 Galaxy_001: thank you
 AntiSquid: ah i need to refresh, my bad Putnam3145
 cegprakash: I thought I just have to save 1 human
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: only 1
 AntiSquid: putnam nice avatar, unlike JBM's
 MSmits: but you get more points with more live humans
 Counterbalance: the formula favours killing zombies more than saving humans
 MSmits: favours killing more within 1 frame
 JBM: how dare you criticize the cg artwork
 cegprakash: oh shit so it's GA
 Galaxy_001: convert your program into machine code. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org/</a>
 MSmits: that only kicks in if i dont have a hardcoded solution
 Astrobytes: We know Galaxy_001, thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: monte carlo worked ok
 MSmits: was easy to code too
 Putnam3145: well that's assembly technically, however,
 Putnam3145: i did mean assembly in the first place
 Galaxy_001: welcome.
 cegprakash: i think it's a GA
 cegprakash: choose an area to defend
 cegprakash: then expand from there
 AntiSquid: but do you mutate&#160;? 
 MSmits: it's not really about defending aside from making sure you lure the zombies away from at least 1 human
 cegprakash: but choosing the area is random
 MSmits: it's about herding the zombies together
 MSmits: and then killing them all at once
 cegprakash: wait what u can herd :O
 MSmits: they will follow you, if you are closest to them
 Counterbalance: ah you have the rank i used to have there, msmits.. time to revisit (and cheat, probably, like the top 5&#160;;))
 MSmits: you are faster
 MSmits: I cheated too Counterbalance
 Astrobytes: Cheat better
 Counterbalance: not fair!
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: my Mc was rank 200-250 or so
 MSmits: it's over a year ago though
 Astrobytes: I just can't do the validator cheats
 cegprakash: i don't think it's called herding
 cegprakash: it's still defending
 MSmits: dont remember all the details, except i wrote a unity program that used  a mix of hardcoded moves and optimization functions to get a good route
 cegprakash: and then exapanding
 Astrobytes: I don't mind or anything, just not for ,e
 Astrobytes: *me
 cegprakash: herding is no use if we can't defend the right humans
 Astrobytes: Rules to live by ceg
 MSmits: well Astrobytes, if you consider it in the same light as number shifting, it seems ok
 MSmits: you still need to figure out the best route, that doesnt come free
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's fair. But leaked validators though
 MSmits: i did it on cotr and zombies
 Astrobytes: Still, freely available which evens the field
 MSmits: not A*craft, still my contest bot there
 Astrobytes: Must do that again, liked that
 MSmits: I liked it ok, had no idea how to solve it though
 AntiSquid: there was some CG meme with the keyword herding and i can't remember it&#160;:/
 MSmits: i just did some DFS 
 Putnam3145: why the heck is my simulation moving backwards, i wonder
 MSmits: with backtracking
 Astrobytes: Time distortion. Black hole maybe. Run. Run away.
 Putnam3145: by which i mean i just sorta implemented the movement code like they implied I should, in coders strike back
 x-N0: Too much smart challenges for today, lets do some crud.
 x-N0: &gt;D
 Putnam3145: but looking at the debug output
 MSmits: Putnam3145 physics shows the universe is symmetric with respect to time and at the level of particles, you cant tell which direction time is flowing
 Putnam3145: the simulated one is going PRECISELY backwards
 Astrobytes: Precisely at the moment you observed it perhaps
 Putnam3145: timeless physics is interesting but T-symmetry isn't actually a thing even in quantum mechanics IIRC
 MSmits: CPT symmetry is
 Putnam3145: *CPT*-symmetry is, which is where you can't tell the universe moving forwards in time from the universe moving backwards in time, and also mirrored, and with all charges reversed
 MSmits: yes
 Putnam3145: this is where that news about a "parallel universe made of antimatter" a few months back came from
 MSmits: yeah
 Putnam3145: it's a valid solution to consider that time is infinite in both directions, and if you go into "negative time" past the big bang you get an identical, mirrored universe made of antimatter, where time flows backwards
 MSmits: and it's also why in feynman diagrams anti matter is drawn as moving back in time
 Putnam3145: but like, it's a *valid solution*
 Putnam3145: there's no strong evidence for it
 MSmits: makes sense
 Putnam3145: or, really, even weak evidence, that news article was reporting on something which could be explained by many things, one of which HAPPENS to be that hypothesis
 AntiSquid: where can i read more about this?
 AntiSquid: any links?
 MSmits: hmm
 Counterbalance: there's no evidence whatsoever that time and space exist&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: All solutions are valid solutions until proven otherwise
 AntiSquid: there's no evidence anything exists, i am just imagining everything Counterbalance
 MSmits: AntiSquid i just picked most of this up from an introduction to elementary particles by David Griffiths
 MSmits: very mathy though
 AntiSquid: ah i have that book ... was going to start reading it, but i keep procrastinating 
 Putnam3145: unfortunately there's no articles I can find that aren't clickbait "SCIENTISTS CONFIRM PARALLEL UNIVERSE" stuff
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://nuclphys.sinp.msu.ru/books/b/Griffiths.pdf">http://nuclphys.sinp.msu.ru/books/b/Griffiths.pdf</a>
 MSmits: found it
 AntiSquid: ya i have the book already, but thanks :p
 MSmits: it's awesome AntiSquid. I got to chapter 7 or so reading and did all the exercises up to chapter 5
 Putnam3145: i literally could not believe it when one of the recent major video game releases had baryon asymmetry as not just a part of the plot but as the actual crux of the worldbuilding
 MSmits: Higgs particle is in chapter 11 i think 
 Putnam3145: like, who does that
 Astrobytes: For god's sakes Jim I'm a bilogist not a damn physicist
 Astrobytes: *biologist
 Putnam3145: i mean, I did think about making an entire RPG based entirely around, like, group theory
 MSmits: we will talk about elelphants and giraffes later Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Putnam3145: then realized I was slightly in over my head and started work on building an entire magic system that I wouldn't tell anyone was literally just quaternions,
 Putnam3145: the fact that I am telling anyone should say how well that panned out
 MSmits: panned is a pun?
 Putnam3145: i feel like it ought to be but I'm not sure why
 Counterbalance: AntiSquid exactly
 Astrobytes: "panned critically" is a thing
 Putnam3145: oh, it's because I'm adding my acceleration vector
 Putnam3145: to my position
 Putnam3145: instead of my velocity vector
 Putnam3145: well, that would do it
 MSmits: sorry guys, I did not know mentioning time would unleash the putnam
 MSmits: I will censor the physics part of myself when he is online to preserve your sanity
 Astrobytes: noted
 Putnam3145: mildly perturbed that it took me no more than 12 hours to become known for being unleashed when certain topics come up
 Putnam3145: usually it takes longer
 Astrobytes: Welcome.
 MSmits: yeah welcome
 Counterbalance: time always seems to run out very fast here on cg
 MSmits: yeah
 JBM: so i suppose asking how is ur csb is a bit late
 Putnam3145: actually it's been 36 hours, oh no
 Putnam3145: i miscounted an entire day
 Astrobytes: PW - Perception Wrecker &gt; CG
 MSmits: it happens
 Astrobytes: putnams perception of time has already been wrecked
 MSmits: yeah, he just flipped his charge and parity and hoped he would get that time back but alas
 AntiSquid: what? no. don't kill physics discussions in chat, that's like censorship, freedom of speech is endorsed here
 Astrobytes: lol * 2
 Astrobytes: Scientific discussions are indeed welcome
 MSmits: yeah we do that a lot
 MSmits: first time I find someone that knows what cpt symmetry is though
 MSmits: well maybe if AntiSquid spent more time reading his book it would have happened sooner
 Astrobytes: I'd heard of it, that doesn't really count though, putnam knew it
 AntiSquid: well i would have known it too if i were spending more time reading
 Astrobytes: Ahh the symmetry
 MSmits: my two finger typing seems quite sufficient
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: well the other book i got at the same time based on a recommandation was: "Weinberg S. Gravitation and cosmology.. principles and applications of the general theory of relativity"
 AntiSquid: didn't start reading that one either
 MSmits: sounds good
 MSmits: can you follow the math in it? I am guessing so, but this stuff is not popular scientific literature
 MSmits: it's actual physics for people with calculus, which you do get when studying CS I suppose
 Astrobytes: Squiddy's good with maths
 MSmits: elementary particle physics was not exactly easy
 MSmits: ah well that helps
 AntiSquid: when reading physics books i don't always understand the formula but if you follow the text carefully along with the formula you kinda understand what is being talked about from the entire context
 MSmits: true
 AntiSquid: also some formulas are explained in detailed and proved step by step so ...
 Astrobytes: True. If you show the proof it can be easier to follow, applies in many situations
 AntiSquid: i also pay close attention to the conclusions and interpretations of the formula by the author, very interesting insight to take note of sometimes
 MSmits: before I discovered CG, one of my hobby's was this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/kTTzyx9">https://imgur.com/a/kTTzyx9</a>
 AntiSquid: he doesn't just take the formula at face value ...
 Astrobytes: You're wasted in your current job AntiSquid you know that right
 MSmits: those are solutions of a QfT book i did some exercises from
 MSmits: i typed them out in word equation editor :P
 AntiSquid: nobody is wasted, i didn't put in enough effort to go further
 AntiSquid: or i wasn't convincing enough
 Astrobytes: Never too late 
 AntiSquid: MSmits ya i have difficulties understanding most of that
 AntiSquid: img
 MSmits: it's a matter of time invested really
 Astrobytes: I don't mean you are a waste, I mean you're not fulfilling your potential in your current job
 MSmits: you probably could if you started from the beginning
 MSmits: everyone here has the minimum intelligence level to get started and learn all of that stuff
 AntiSquid: is there an easy tutorial? you know like tutorialspoint is for different coding languages&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm well you can get started at different points
 MSmits: and it depends a lot on what knowledge you're missing
 AntiSquid: mainly understanding and remembering what the various glyphs mean
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: those are mostly integrals and symbols for wave functions i think
 MSmits: yeah and derivatives
 MSmits: you know integral calculus?
 MSmits: not sure how far you got with that
 Astrobytes: All the 'non-standard' mathy ones are from the wave function AntiSquid
 MSmits: yeah, this is mostly basic quantum mechanics i think
 Astrobytes: I'm having chemistry flashbacks
 MSmits: it's chapter 1 and 2 of the book
 Astrobytes: Yup
 MSmits: btw to be fair this was a harder book than elementary particle physics, but icouldnt find my solutions for that, i think i did them on paper
 MSmits: doing these ones on paper is a nightmare
 Astrobytes: Maple 
 MSmits: i would try to write them out and then make mistakes and it would become unreadable
 MSmits: yeah, that would probabyl have been better
 MSmits: i got real fast with word equation editor though
 Astrobytes: I never want to see word equation editor again. Ever.
 MSmits: i didnt know any better 
 Astrobytes: I used maple or typed up my shit in latex
 MSmits: i used to use latex but it was such a long time ago, i didnt want to relearn it
 Astrobytes: Probably take less time than word equation editor :D
 MSmits: maybe
 MSmits: i think when solving exercises like these, the thinking time is the bottleneck anyway
 Astrobytes: Still, whatever works at the time eh
 Astrobytes: Yeah totally
 Astrobytes: I used to do everything on whiteboard first anyway
 MSmits: i suck at writing on whiteboards, my handwriting is bad. I am lucky for being a teacher in the digital age
 MSmits: lots of powerpoint
 MSmits: i do some stuff on whiteboard, but I need to focus not to screw up
 Astrobytes: Oh I'm terrible on classroom whiteboards, for my own use I'm good
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: "Can you write that a lot bigger please"
 Astrobytes: Still have that issue at the conservation centre lol
 MSmits: well, I did notice that whenever i hand the marker to a student, they are always much worse
 Astrobytes: Winning
 dbdr: MSmits: is this an interesting problem?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png">https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png</a>
 MSmits: lol, yeah kinda
 Astrobytes: mwahaha that is MSmits 100%
 MSmits: electricity is not my thing, but this sort of trick does work on me
 Astrobytes: Never noticed :P
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Anyways, I'm out for tonight. Take care all, bn/gn/w/e
 MSmits: gn!
 AntiSquid: so mathematicians value more than physicists
 MSmits: value more?
 AntiSquid: see the nerd sniping png
 AntiSquid: 3 points, not just 2
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: maybe it's harder to make it work on mathematicians
 Ashraful: Anyone needs me as a helper for project?
 Ashraful: at GitHub?
 Ashraful: I am interested in teamwork.
 Ashraful: Zafar Iqbal, I have detected you
 AntiSquid: you can google for "github project to contribute to"
 AntiSquid: or check the list on github directly, they have some list for beginners 
 Anth: Ohh, I like the new layout
 Anth: everyone else in shock or asleep?
 th3h3r0: asleep
 Anth: ok, react tomorrow then
 terminatorRain: emmm. it's hard
 Anth: What's hard?
 awray3: shock?
 CassyWu: is there anyone can see my message? how can i join a font-end tech group?
 th3h3r0: no
 Putnam3145: what precisely does "group" mean here
 CassyWu: actually, i'm new guy , have no idea how to play.:joy:
 th3h3r0: slowly
 TheTaskmaster: sup
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Hello, i'm struggling with bug in coders strike back silver league. That bug makes me turn around the checkpoint, how to fix it?

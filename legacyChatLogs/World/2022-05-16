 Wontonimo: lol ToastyBreadsicle
 eulerscheZahl: no, it's 51000 vs 20 per year
 Wontonimo: oh, because "." doesn't mean decimal.  Got it.
 ToastyBreadsicle: decimals in europe are denoted by commas
 ToastyBreadsicle: for whatever reason
 Wontonimo: I obviously have cultural bias that I forget about
 Wontonimo: I bet the site that processed the info considers "." as a decimal and just rounded it off because it was posted as 20.000

 Howwwww: :angry:
 MSmits: that game looks nice. 4p without the destabilizing effect on the leaderboard
 MSmits: there's no luck factor from 1 or 2 players doubleteaming on a 3rd
 eulerscheZahl: it's just an optim with random validators
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I'm top 100 pr2 now, will code a defense for early rushes, hope maybe top 30, then i'll quit and try a different game
 MSmits: maybe this is a good choice
 MSmits: thanks for hungarian method btw, it's quite nice
 MSmits: I think I can use this on multiple games
 eulerscheZahl: thank Kuhn and Munkres for it&#160;;)
 MSmits: always wondered how to handle multiple agents and assignments
 eulerscheZahl: for smaller ones like codebusters you can bruteforce it
 MSmits: you can, but should you, really.
 eulerscheZahl: hungarian method has its justification to exist and have an own wikipedia article
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: not spending too much time on 1 multi is a lot better for learning new things
 galuso: can't understand what the euclid number of an integer is 
 galuso: and how to find
 eulerscheZahl: context?
 galuso: i tryied to google it but it's not too clear
 galuso: You must output the nth Euclid number to the given N.
 galuso: i had to complete this task
 eulerscheZahl: The Euclid numbers are integers of the form En = pn# + 1, where pn# is the nth primorial, i.e. the product of the first n prime numbers.

 PrzemekS: btw it is only me or spring challenge  fog of war is not an easy task to deal with? 
 MSmits: it's never an easy task to deal with unless you don't mind dealing with it poorly

 PrzemekS: this is what i thought, i was searching for papers which can give me some kind of idea, but without luck, only thing i found is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224491323_Dealing_with_Fog_of_War_in_a_Real_Time_Strategy_Game_Environment">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224491323_Dealing_with_Fog_of_War_in_a_Real_Time_Strategy_Game_Environment</a> and iy doesn't convince me

 MSmits: You could maybe keep a "last seen" grid. An array where you keep track of how long it has been since you last had vision there.
 galuso: can't understand y this is wrong
 MSmits: 2D array
 MSmits: me neither galuso
 MSmits: though you seem to be comparing  a string to a character

 galuso: ah ok
 galuso: what should i use to do it theb?
 MSmits: you have to do some googling to figure out how c++ does characters and strings
 galuso: oks
 MSmits: I dont know for sure, i dont like the language for things like this
 MSmits: python is much easier

 eulerscheZahl: try again  with closer neighbors
 MSmits: how do you mean
 MSmits: you mean it won't work with bases really close?
 eulerscheZahl: spawns closer together
 eulerscheZahl: just curious
 MSmits: it failed here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/635348540">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/635348540</a>
 MSmits: it's a vision thing really
 MSmits: I depend on vision for defense. I guess I have to hardcode for the closer spawns
 eulerscheZahl: you are waiting in the first turn?
 MSmits: shouldn't be
 MSmits: ah. no, it sees the 10 pods in the 1st turn
 eulerscheZahl: and you can totally defend the 2nd replay
 MSmits: the problem is that it goes out of vision on the 2nd turn
 MSmits: so my defense thinks there are no enemies
 eulerscheZahl: even if: you only lose 3 units per turn. it helps against rushes to explore a bit and gain platinum
 MSmits: yeah, i think i have a bug as well
 MSmits: it sort of works but not entirely, probably off by 1 error somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: either that or a bad specification
 MSmits: whats a bad specification?
 eulerscheZahl: what you told yourself would be a good idea to implement
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: did you know, that you can zoom in this game?
 MSmits: yeah it's cool
 MSmits: weird that other games dont have this
 eulerscheZahl: you also have messages. but only show in non-debug mode
 eulerscheZahl: there are some features that we lost again over the years
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. for code4life and coders of the carribbean you were always orange, no matter if p1 or p2
 MSmits: confusing
 MSmits: this is like oware where you always appear as p1
 MSmits: even when you are p2
 eulerscheZahl: huh, that happens for oware?
 MSmits: yeah, the output is always 0-5
 MSmits: never 6-11
 eulerscheZahl: ah, no. just visually
 MSmits: output too
 eulerscheZahl: sides still matched reality for CotC, input and output were fine
 eulerscheZahl: just showing you as orange
 MSmits: ah just the color then
 eulerscheZahl: i really liked that
 MSmits: seems like my bot is doing better anyways, even with bugged defense, 67 now
 eulerscheZahl: let's see how well you do
 MSmits: I feel like I have only been implementing basic features so far
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/635350345">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/635350345</a>
 MSmits: my vision strategy is pretty advanced though, i think
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: I keep a vision/ownership/pods present history for all turns
 MSmits: every turn, i do a floodfill from turn 0 to the present turn, taking into account all information
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot what i'm doing in detail. but i have some knowledge of certain and possible/impossible opponent locations
 MSmits: If I see a zone on turn 10 and then again on turn 50, i backwardly set all history to have no enemy pods present, meaning they cannot have passed through that zone
 MSmits: if the ownership has not change to enemy
 eulerscheZahl: i track that too
 MSmits: it helps a ton, really focuses your pods where they have to be
 nahas1: i know this sounds stupid but how do i fix the first step im kinda new
 MSmits: first step of what?
 nahas1: in the pod race
 struct: nice MSmits already top 100
 halofttyd: i am new to coding
 eulerscheZahl: my biggest flaw is not distributing better. when there is a T-shaped branch, i tend to send all left or all right
 MSmits: yeah, i am just fixing my defense strategy and then moving on to a different game struct
 struct: did you choose one yet?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I make every zone a hungarian method assignment. Since distance is a big factor in this, they will sort of split usually
 MSmits: but often too many are sent into a branch the enemy cannot go, when 1 or 2 would have sufficed
 eulerscheZahl: i know. but when i played PR, i wasn't that knowledgeable
 eulerscheZahl: and now i don't want to return
 MSmits: yeah I get that
 MSmits: struct i didnt yet
 MSmits: I want to do an older one though and get 4k CP for it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: started in May 2017
 MSmits: though that optim looks cool
 MSmits: maybe i will do botters of the galaxy =)
 eulerscheZahl: back to the code? easy CP
 MSmits: yeah that one
 MSmits: kinda trying to figure out how to do the squares
 eulerscheZahl: "botters of the galaxy"noooo
 MSmits: some people seem to like it
 eulerscheZahl: you won't, trust me
 MSmits: because the sim is big?
 struct: Its like the previous contest
 struct: but worse
 struct: sorry creators of the contest
 eulerscheZahl: heuristic mess, no need for sim
 eulerscheZahl: good summary struct
 MSmits: ahh well, I will postpone that then and do back to the code
 halofttyd: i am new at coding
 MSmits: it's probably called time travelling squares now or something
 eulerscheZahl: back to the code (or whatever the name is now): rectangles are easy. more complex shapes is where the fun begins
 halofttyd: i am new at coding

 TINOUAINANI: hi , i have a problem with c++ in clash code when they told us to write some thing separeted with space i always have a problem with the last one so it toke a line outside my for loop that print if any one now a better way (sorry for my bad english)
 Wontonimo: what language?  There is often times a "join" function that handles all this for you
 jacek: no better way in c++.
 Wontonimo: oh, c++
 Wontonimo: haha
 TINOUAINANI: relly&#160;?

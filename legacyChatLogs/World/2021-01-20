 MashiroMoritaka: Can you pass by reference here in C++ seems like my variable isnt being changed when passed by reference
 reCurse: Yes
 3ataja: what happens at 1:00
 Wontonimo: don't they know coders are usually awake at 1am.  4am is a better time for redeploys
 therealbeef: server updates rankings/scores or something; not very efficiently apparently
 Wontonimo: anyway, it doesn't really effect me.  it's 7:30 pm here
 3ataja: oh i see
 3ataja: lol
 Daiim: AHHH thx for explanation
 Kemeros: Evening. Or maybe not for you. So hello.
 chokemedaddy: kinky
 tekki: AutomatonNN wwhat's going on please?
 AutomatonNN: guotable is pretty cool
 tekki: AutomatonNN will you kill me someday?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 tekki: Automaton2000 what's the deal?
 Automaton2000: oh i like that game
 tekki: ok tell me when you wanna stop it please AutomatonNN&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: for now it's a problem
 tekki: gl bro&#160;:)
 Automaton2000: even if i have a high winrate
 jacek: AutomatonNN what happened to the chat
 AutomatonNN: code sharing and then that i got it so far
 algoprg: Hello Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i have a good bot
 jacek: Automaton2000 where
 Automaton2000: you can build a wall
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: Automaton2000 not anymore. trump isn't president
 Automaton2000: i was thinking about that
 algoprg: Automaton2000  how are u
 Automaton2000: no idea how it works
 MSmits: Automaton2000 jumping on the trump-train rather late :Pp
 Automaton2000: i see there is a new contest
 Astrobytes: ...
 MSmits: morning Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: morning MSmits
 MSmits: got my search race working somewhat, it doesnt crash, but overshoots checkpoints so i guess i may still have sim bugs
 MSmits: it is sooo much simpler than csb, i could delete half my code
 MSmits: but maybe i deleted 1% too much :P
 Astrobytes: nice, yeah much simpler! I've been meaning to rewrite mine for ages now
 Astrobytes: It's 'on the list'...
 MSmits: i like what illedan did with the input/output as well
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's useful
 MSmits: just noticed the expert format
 MSmits: no more weird x y output
 MSmits: just to get an angle out
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523166890">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523166890</a> 
 MSmits: yay&#160;:)
 MSmits: for some reason switching to expert mode fixed it, my output was apparently bugged
 jacek: hows connect4 meta now?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/648747ec-f2a1-483f-8231-12e7f1984b1c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/648747ec-f2a1-483f-8231-12e7f1984b1c</a>
 MSmits: it's a bit faster because the tree is deeper, but not anywhere near solving depth
 jacek: youre really gonna do million sims eh
 MSmits: i dunno, I can only run 2 at a time on my computer, so if a different game interests me, i switch it
 MSmits: currently running oware and connect4
 jacek: thanks for pushing me up&#160;:)
 MSmits: 1 million seems likely though
 MSmits: yeah, as i said, you are far more random in oware
 MSmits: harder to handle
 MSmits: in other games too i guess
 MSmits: i think some unpredictability should be part of a bot so it's fair
 MSmits: (that you are at 1)
 MSmits: well time for my next class. Teaching only 2 online classes today
 DJHeroicKitten_f51d: Can someone provide the python solution for "The lucky number"?
 jacek: its also for testing. how can you tell if bot is stronger when its either 0% or 100% and its tweak one param
 MSmits: totally agree on that jaek
 MSmits: jacek
 jacek: DJHeroicKitten_f51d are you stuck with this puzzle
 Cdude: hi all
 tekki: hi Cdude
 MSmits: it's weird, i pass all the tests in search race, but i keep failing on different validators on submit
 KiwiTae: timeouts?
 jrke: thats time issue MS
 jrke: use max 35 ms
 struct: wasnt time issue fixed?
 jrke: cause there is any bug related to that i can just use 37 ms max on submits
 jrke: struct for me no
 jrke: or lemme try submit
 MSmits: let me try
 darkhorse64: I don't do that. I always use max time
 struct: whats your checkpoints max?
 jrke: nope i am not passing all validators on 45 ms
 struct: how do you meassure time?
 jrke: chrono 
 MSmits: weird
 MSmits: if i set 35 ms i crash a lot more
 MSmits: maybe i do something wrong with input/output like a noob :P
 MSmits: struct, my checkpoints max is 24
 MSmits: this would have come out in the testcases 
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523173523">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523173523</a>
 darkhorse64: Full thrust all along
 MSmits: that doesnt work on every test case does it?
 darkhorse64: No, this one is an exception but I use it as an efficiency benchmark. When you are constantly below 107, it looks good for all
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: mmh pretty sure it is not a time bug, i my bot is doing some weird stuff
 MSmits: btw, wow my score is bad, i get 143.59 on that testcase
 darkhorse64: I even manage to go below 106 but it was less efficient for others. I need more sims
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523174488">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/523174488</a>
 struct: what search do you use darkhorse64?
 MSmits: this is my problem. Somehow it is unsure and gets stuck
 MSmits: might be scoring issue
 darkhorse64: GA
 struct: avx it
 darkhorse64: Collision check in avx :scream:
 MSmits: mmh, i didnt even check how illedan does the collisions
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54c78e49-7f85-4037-9231-9d296adcfd8e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54c78e49-7f85-4037-9231-9d296adcfd8e</a>
 MSmits: thats from the csb referee
 MSmits: but optimized a bit
 MSmits: i dont do a collision time check and all that, thats pointless
 RoboStac: how do you handle multiple checkpoints in one turn then?
 MSmits: does this happen?
 MSmits: if it does, then i am screwed&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I am using floats but does it really makes a difference on 64 bits. Yes, it does
 MSmits: yeah i will switch to floats eventually
 RoboStac: I'm pretty sure people were saying it did when searchrace launched 
 darkhorse64: Illedan's handles it. I trust him
 RoboStac: I don't handle it either
 MSmits: allright then
 MSmits: RoboStac you dont handle 2 checkpoints in 1 turn?
 RoboStac: no
 RoboStac: but I'm also ranked 47 in searchrace so I'm bad
 MSmits: doesnt have to be because you dont handle 2 checkpoints at once
 RoboStac: no, theres other reasons too
 MSmits: also, i am looking for a bug that causes my bot to fail, i doubt this is that bug
 RoboStac: it's my csb with as few changes as possible in order to pass
 jrke: even i don't handle but i am ranked 25 not bad but not good also
 darkhorse64: Some checkpoints are close
 MSmits: RoboStac that's precisely what i am doing
 MSmits: I'll handle the checkpoints for offline solving if i ever get to that point
 DomiKo: In "Hold the Line" that could happend
 DomiKo: Or not hmmm
 MSmits: your speed still has to be like 2000
 darkhorse64: One difference with csb is that you must trunc speed and pos, csb rounds one and truncs the other
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: hmm, is a trunc the same as a (int) cast?
 MSmits: i dont remember what happens with negatives
 DomiKo: its ceil for negative
 DomiKo: and floor for +
 MSmits: is this the same for trunc and int cast?
 darkhorse64: I use lib trunc
 struct: trunc(-1.2) = -1, trunc(1.2)  =  1
 MSmits: but thats true for int cast also i think?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: allright then
 darkhorse64: afk
 MSmits: trunc might be better anyways
 MSmits: casting is expensive
 MSmits: well at least thats a bug in my sim i need to fix, it does it the csb way
 MSmits: finally got a 100%, rank 57 
 ikadimi: hey i have a number ex 196. and a range between 20 and 30 how to divide that number into groups of the given range&#160;?
 MSmits: just any groups?
 ikadimi: yes
 MSmits: i guess divide it by 20 and round down
 MSmits: then check the remainder
 ikadimi: the bigger the group the better now im starting at 30 and for every iteration to 20 im checking if modulo is 0 or bigger than min
 MSmits: if the remainder is less than the number of groups
 MSmits: sure you can do that
 ikadimi: yet for some reason it doesn't always work
 MSmits: well makes sense
 MSmits: sometimes if you subtract 30 from the total number x times you wont be left with a number between 20 and 30
 MSmits: in that case, go back 1 step and split the leftover in half
 jrke: if x is 31 then x - 30 will be 1
 MSmits: or go back 2 steps and split the leftover in 3 parts
 ikadimi: yep for those cases i just return the max
 MSmits: but thats wrong
 ikadimi: so 1 group is 30 1 is 1
 MSmits: because it needs to be minimum 20
 MSmits: so do what i said, go back x steps, however many you need to split it such that it fits
 ikadimi: ok ima read through your answer and make it work ty
 MSmits: good luck
 MSmits: not sure if this is the most efficient way btw, this is just something i might try, never done this puzzle
 ikadimi: its not a puzzle just a project im working on
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well it sounds like a typical cg puzzle :P
 ikadimi:&#160;:)
 jrke: MS you gained my interest in SR again
 jrke: now i will re write it today night
 MSmits: have fun&#160;:)
 jrke: i have interest in many games atm - Tron battle, D&amp;B, othello, SR,  oware also 
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 jrke: in all i have to write something or rewrite
 DomiKo: uuu Tron Battle
 jrke: for paper soccer i dare to open that multi once in every month and after reading rules i simply close it&#160;;)
 MSmits: so you're saying jacek wrote the description so well, it's enjoyable to read multiple times
 jrke: yes and every time when i read it i think its tough for me to do atm
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: it does seem tough
 MSmits: ahhhh now i understand my problem with SR. My exploration parameter was waaaayyyy off
 darkhorse64: Hey MSmits, not too bad, I had approximately the same score when I started
 MSmits: rank 46 now with 10x higher exploration parameter
 MSmits: or 10 x smaller score factor actually, but thats the same thing
 jrke: 10x gives 9 rank
 MSmits: basically what was happening, i was only using like 9k mcts nodes
 MSmits: it would keep selecting the same path, all the way to the depth limit
 MSmits: not making any new nodes
 jrke: oh
 MSmits: thats what you get with extreme exploitation and little exploration
 MSmits: should have known&#160;:)
 jrke: time to go bye cya
 MSmits: bye jrke
 jrke: b-bye MS
 Horizontalx: TANE
 Horizontalx: mu[E^(O)J_RP you hi
 Astrobytes: oh, you again. Are you broken or what.
 Wang-sirs: :laughing:
 Wang-sirs: the game is too hard
 Horizontalx: i hate the clash of code tasks it is nor complied  to every languages
 kovi: recurse are you using mcts based nn?
 kovi: (nn for mcts eval)
 MSmits: afaik he is
 MSmits: but he doesnt share much detail
 jacek: i think he uses policy
 kovi: alfa0 like?
 kovi: and you jacek?
 jrke: which game you are talking about?
 kovi: any...:rage:
 MSmits: mostly simple games though
 kovi: (well, many simple boardgames)
 kovi: yeah
 MSmits: I'm unsure of how far the codesize will take a NN on more complex games
 MSmits: but even in more complex games, you can use a NN to eval a part of it
 MSmits: instead of the whole gamestate
 MSmits: regular bots usually have separate features that get added together with parameters
 MSmits: no reason one or more of those features cant be lumped together and have a nn fitted for them
 kovi: true
 kovi: if those can be optimized separately
 Horizontalx: i60e4ayrn uout iwYI YH ELLO EVERYONE I AM EH q[]pbj
 kovi: which in many times impossible. eg. for this year raic i struggled with  the inter-relation of various parts/heuristics
 MSmits: yeah, well if you have more than 4 or 5, you're going to have to use special methods to fit. I have problems with that too
 kovi: and the whole thing reminds the automated driving world...some are using divide and conquer, some are shooting for a single mega NN
 MSmits: divide and conquer is definitely better. You'll want to know what the problem is when accidents happen. If you have to look at some huge NN, it's a lot harder
 MSmits: accidents will happen
 MSmits: but maybe there are drawbacks to D&amp;C as well, i dunno
 kovi: and not all auto-cars can afford to make all "parts" themselves/atonce
 MSmits: yeah that too
 kovi: (car-makers)
 Angecide: haha wtf, all I did was add the rule to my code where if a draw occurs then the player with most won sub boards win the game and I am already around top 30 legend in uttt
 jacek: kovi i used NN only for eval
 Angecide: also reading jacek mcts solver for Yavalath on github helped a lot in getting a good understanding of mcts solver
 jacek: Angecide but thats the rule of uttt here, win most small boards
 MSmits: oh thats nice jacek, didnt know you wrote that
 jacek: i did?
 MSmits: maybe he just hacked you
 Angecide: yep, I stared at it a lot and then it finally clicked in my brain
 jacek: ah yes i wrote about meta mcts solver
 MSmits: oh meta mcts
 MSmits: same thing i guess
 kovi: nice angecide
 Angecide: also I thought that the draw rule was pointless since it was more important to just win the game
 Angecide: but it turns out it is actually useful to have in the code
 MSmits: accuracy matters
 MSmits: the rule makes draws a lot more rare
 jacek: but favors p1
 Angecide: yea
 MSmits: I suspect that the game would be solved as a win with this rule, as a draw without it
 MSmits: win for p1 obviously
 jacek: also i think as p2 you turn many loses into draws now
 MSmits: how so?
 jacek: to Angecide when he added that rule
 MSmits: you mean by picking better moves in the search?
 MSmits: oh yes
 jacek: or many draws as p1 into wins
 jacek: :thinking:
 MSmits: both
 MSmits: should be just as important
 jacek: Angecide hmm what part of it clicked to you?
 jacek: i think im gonna write some short article about mcts solver
 Angecide: it's a bit hard to put into words
 MSmits: maybe try and hum it
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Horizontalx: y iauwji5 yu a reall aore to haha i am iyou alal yatrr ia m t uham royu aralla rtoauei am ai wnm soi ri so ri am dna i wi ll aos dod therweo st6oo ypi ua dnm it6 oy 
 Angecide: For me personally, I knew how vanilla mcts worked, but the part that didn't click was what to do when the tree includes terminal nodes. Like how far should I return an Infinity up the tree and when can I be sure that a node non-terminal node in the tree is a proven loss/win etc. 
 Angecide: then I read ur code, and after following the logic carefully, it made sense
 MSmits: Angecide I dont even use the value property for this. It's annoying because it's not suitable for draws
 MSmits: i have a separate property i use for solving
 MSmits: on the node
 Overl0rd: .
 MSmits: usually a int_8_t with possible values -1,0,1 for loss/draw/win and 2 if it's ongoing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jello
 jacek: i overwrite the value and use boolean if its solved
 jacek: then by value i see w/d/l
 MSmits: that works too
 MSmits: also 8 bit property on the node
 MSmits: i dont keep the value on the node at all actually, just score and visits
 jacek: i meant the score
 MSmits: ah ok
 Angecide: I liked the part in ur code where u did parent-&gt;score += 0; thought it was quite funny
 MSmits: lol...
 MSmits: I did not know you even troll your own code jacek
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, I had good results with depth decay factor +256 to -256 win/loss  &gt;&gt; (depth&gt;&gt;1) .. it naturally goes to 0 for undecided game.  ok ill shutup
 jacek: MSmits readability
 jacek: like using masks 1&lt;&lt;0, 1&lt;&lt;2, 1&lt;&lt;3, ..
 MSmits: ahhh
 Horizontalx: anaj keo haha  ah ha Y OU aos fu UF nqyn
 MSmits: jacek why aren't you a moderator
 BlaiseEbuth: erf
 eulerscheZahl: robo was faster
 BlaiseEbuth: Not fast enough
 MSmits: ah
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 jacek: because i would be a moderator AND troll
 jacek: and you dont want that
 eulerscheZahl: while I still tried to translate, deepl doesn't understand that langauge
 eulerscheZahl: language
 RoboStac: I even messaged him to give him a chance after the last one
 RoboStac: but no, ignored and still spamming
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl he had numbers in his words
 MSmits: that should be a clue :P
 eulerscheZahl: i just logged in
 MSmits: ah ok 
 BlaiseEbuth: I'am mod and troll jacek. Think the second is a sort of condition for the first. :3
 MSmits: it's a bar. "Anything worse than me gets kicked"

 eulerscheZahl: submit it 3 times and you should get the 100% correctness PatrickMcGinnisII
 BlaiseEbuth: RoboStac&#160;: go on discord to explain to Horizontalx why he was banned
 BlaiseEbuth: Or ban him again...

 MSmits: cool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my code isn't pretty or perfect yet
 MSmits: of course not, it's php
 MSmits: :grin:
 chinoto: 🔥
 PatrickMcGinnisII: none of the top php guys have 100% yet as far as i can tell
 MSmits: I made a minesweeper solver as part of an AI course
 MSmits: didnt do this puzzle though
 chinoto: PHP was my second language (VB.NET didn't last long), glad to be done with it.
 chinoto: So many inconsistencies.
 AtharvaCoder: hi i am atharva
 Westicles: I must have the worst, only wins 1/8
 MSmits: you can eliminate some stuff by combining overlapping regions and such
 eulerscheZahl: and the contribution is a little friendly to the player at least: your first click always finds a 0
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is it alwasy 20 7?  i left the first move there, but wasn't sure
 eulerscheZahl: boards are randomly generated after your first click
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/83D27pH">https://imgur.com/a/83D27pH</a>
 MR3M3AT: whats the string for looping a coordinance in C++?
 MSmits: I wrote this, it was the last addition to my solver. 
 MSmits: does your solver spot this Westicles?
 Westicles: No.  I start with three random clicks and then do almost nothing and somehow it works once in a while
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: well it's what programmers are supposed to do. Be lazy. if it works, it works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, the best solutions seem to use linear algebra gaussian ellimination and then probabilities ... the obvious ones are easy ... then it gets crazy
 MSmits: that's a sign that it's a good puzzle
 MSmits: if people go crazy over it
 MSmits: or maybe like you, they didnt know they could spam it a bit until 100% and they kept getting deeper into it&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah i kneew, but I been running at it from a bunch of different directions
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: one comment from the forum:"Got it at try 31 with the laziest AI ever :rofl:"
 MSmits: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can get it green...umm solved, but yea it's like 1/30
 MSmits: c++ regular, 15 xp!
 MSmits: yay
 eulerscheZahl: #fr chat hates this puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: congrats smits
 MSmits: might be a WW2 thing eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: several binary decisions can happen so probability of solving gets halved everytime
 MSmits: you should only take the unary decisions then
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so 1 out of 32 is prolly pretty close
 eulerscheZahl: i solve it in &gt;50% of my tests
 eulerscheZahl: not even working with probabilities if I need guessing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, but I'm missing some clues ... I really don't wanna do the linear algebra
 jacek: try nonlinear algebra
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to. just some set intersections
 MSmits: sometimes i think of a joke and I decide not to do it and jacek does it instead
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I do use some union differentials of 2 sets, but i have to take it further
 MSmits: is that union differential thing what i shared?
 MSmits: the overlap thing?

 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, but I'm currently only comparing two #s vertically or horizon adjacent
 eulerscheZahl: do you find the save stop at the top left?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: #s=numbers
 eulerscheZahl: so many typos
 eulerscheZahl: do you find the safe spot at the top left?
 eulerscheZahl: or the mine to begin with
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i look for the obvious num=marked or #of&#160;?=num-marked
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then when i run out of those easy ones i hit the unions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but I'm not doing all of the unions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: apparently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I got better blank area expansion by not sorting the clicks by x,y
 Westicles: Some people take this puzzles very seriously.  One guy in c# has 1044 lines with full comments like it is being graded
 jacek: what happened to discord history?
 eulerscheZahl: one got banned or left himself, not surethat way his messages got deleted too
 eulerscheZahl: then i deleted the rest as it was without any context
 Astrobytes: messages involving that wee dunderheid from earlier are gone
 eulerscheZahl: just found that minesweeper novel in C#that definitely took a while to code
 jacek: Westicles have you seen zeonscave python solution for onboarding?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler, yes i might be missing some of the red square ones in your png
 eulerscheZahl: you mean orange?red is from another user
 eulerscheZahl: that was taken from discord, user made annotations. I made some more
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off for an hourgoing for a walk before the sun goes down
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, well there's two possible outcomes for the top section, but the red square is a known blank
 Westicles: jacek, yeah and agade with the c++ neural net...
 TBali: "minesweeper novel in C#" ... lol  ... if we talk about antigolf, I submitted 113 lines for The Descent in bash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's another one on the left side which solves it, but it involves more than one border square
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bruteforcing border segments is less confusing than matrices

 TeddyTedderson: Heard she was sleeping around with Biden while she was with her first husband.
 TBali: Isn't the election campaign over yet?
 eulerscheZahl: victory speech
 eulerscheZahl: when I linked the stream, he just swore the oath
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lady gaga and JLo sang ... kinda wierd
 eulerscheZahl: totally :D
 MR3M3AT: Good afternoon.
 eulerscheZahl: but not as weird as the previous president

 PatrickMcGinnisII: grab em by the :alien:
 MR3M3AT: Is that just math.
 MR3M3AT: :ok_hand:
 TBali: Has serious timout issues, but finally solved that
 TBali: took long time because of this
 TBali: Has = had
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did you memoizate?
 eulerscheZahl: no timing issues for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't do it yet
 eulerscheZahl: memoization is probably needed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still fixing up this medium puzzle *cough*
 TBali: Yes I memoized, but my first try had bad algo - looping search space not in the right order
 eulerscheZahl: i'm below 80% completion on easy puzzles :D
 TBali: Interestingly tag is Brute-force
 TBali: c'mon euler, you can do it, we trust in you&#160;:-) 
 eulerscheZahl: it's hard
 jacek: thats what she said
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps jacek around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/12323424608735" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 TBali: don't kick
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: kick is useless, jacek finds the way back
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes, ban him
 eulerscheZahl: he has an alt account
 TBali: I am wondering which one is the hardest easy puzzle.Probably mine, from the completion&#160;%
 MR3M3AT: Stupid Weatherboss
 eulerscheZahl: i could move space maze to easy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what TBali tells her&#160;: "Don't kick"
 matez: Hi,Who is in the 1rst 200 of Clash that finish at the 1rst places almost always?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: which puzzle, did i do it?
 jacek: that sounded like automaton
 TBali: Hello World - not a particularly good starred one
 MR3M3AT: Thats the starting code right?
 TBali: not  algorithmicly hard at all, but have to be precise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh that was easy, distance of lat/long ... google is your friend
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh you gave the answer
 TBali: PatrickGinnisII - you solved it already
 TBali: mistyped name, sorry
 zhoubou: TBali hint: type "Patrick" and press Tab.&#160;:)
 TBali:&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: innaugeration ended by garth brooks, smh
 eulerscheZahl: is the inauguration always so religious?
 TBali: Must be because of some polls of religiousness in USA
 TBali: Or maybe sincere, who knows
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they made a space for 100 demonstrators to watch
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's wierd
 TBali: In medium I am at 98% completion
 eulerscheZahl: 76% easy76% medium78% hard79% very hard
 eulerscheZahl: that are my stats

 TBali: 100% 98% 90% 36%
 zhoubou: eulerscheZahl You solved 72.2 easy puzzles?
 MR3M3AT: yikes.
 Westicles: 100%, 96%, 77%,79%
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't count them
 TBali: Still missing  cca 40 puzzles, mostly in very hard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 100, 67, 37,21  show offs
 zhoubou: How do you see percentages?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 eulerscheZahl: top right of the category
 TBali: eulerscheZahl  06:23PMeasy is harder to find motivation
 RoboStac: 95/95/92/95. Guess I need to solve some hard puzzles for consistency
 TBali: on no "cat ... g++ ... invoke"&#160;:-) 
 eulerscheZahl: how do you count that so fast?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: space maze, rate 6% oO
 eulerscheZahl: or are those percentages, not absolute numbers?
 TBali: 95 easy would be a feat
 TBali: total # is maybe 60
 RoboStac: percents
 zhoubou: No, I think it's exactly 95 TBali
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i'm a bit slow
 zhoubou: document.querySelectorAll('.puzzle-info').length95
 TBali: Right, it is more.
 TBali: 96 in my list plus 4 withdrawn
 eulerscheZahl: is robo the user with the 2nd most solved puzzles after Stilgart?
 Westicles: I've been dreading these graph puzzles, but they aren't so bad.  Too of them had near identical solutions
 Westicles: two
 MR3M3AT: Wow im in first place in the wood league
 RoboStac: when I did space maze it was my only unsolved puzzle, but I haven't done many of the recent ones
 MR3M3AT: and i just started O-o
 TBali: most uneven in difficulty is the medium lot

 Westicles: Electrical grid to mars colonization was just changing an int to double
 TBali: okay those were easy.
 eulerscheZahl: and with my minesweeper contribution i'm not totally innocent in regards to identical puzzles either
 Westicles: And now there seem to be two binary tree problems
 eulerscheZahl: i lost overview of puzzles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler VBoub's wasn't graphical tho
 eulerscheZahl: but algo-wise it's pretty much the same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all his testcases have simplistic definitve solutions
 Westicles: cistercian numerals got deleted, so can't catch up if you skipped it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and it's opposite, he asked for mine list
 eulerscheZahl: not the first to get deleted because of low rating
 PatrickMcGinnisII: your version isn't worth the xp, ha
 TBali: Robostac you are one of the rare solver who has 2 favourite languages, not, one
 eulerscheZahl: Python and Go?
 RoboStac: I orignally started on this site trying to learn Go so all my early ones are using that
 TBali: Westicles - what is your original solver language? C++
 TBali: I suppose all the rest is invoking g++&#160;:-)
 Westicles: yes and yes
 eulerscheZahl: and did you hardcode validators or take creator solutions?
 Westicles: who me?  No... well, I played space maze manually so that's hardcode?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, but in a fun way :P
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of what some did for number shifting
 eulerscheZahl: or me on tapework (hacker.org)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so the validators are the same as testcases?
 eulerscheZahl: tapeworm*
 eulerscheZahl: no PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, so i gave up for good reason
 TBali: is it possible to invoke ANY of the 26 languages solutions from bash?For  tried it out only for C,C++,python and php.
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles had a contribution about invoking other languages
 eulerscheZahl: "cheating the system"
 Astrobytes: *Abusing
 eulerscheZahl: sorry

 eulerscheZahl: see the provided solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well it has all the options for each lang
 TBali: funny contribution
 Astrobytes: I still find it amusing yeah
 eulerscheZahl: great job for reversing that part of CG
 Westicles: I got some PMs of people wanting to put a third approval but I am wary...
 eulerscheZahl: i think some puzzles are better in WIP, just as a proof of concept
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well system calls are restricted in most the langs i believe
 eulerscheZahl: like my 3D teapot&#160;:)
 Westicles: restricted?  which ones?
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed, I agree euler.
 struct: maybe CG needs a showcase
 TBali: does it work for php - you have to escape $
 TBali: Ah ,it is there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shell_exec in php doesn't work i believe
 TBali: no I meant the opposite
 eulerscheZahl: i still have that sound toggle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/826998f668b6e336606698b7eda1fbf760907a">https://www.codingame.com/demo/826998f668b6e336606698b7eda1fbf760907a</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: suprised system call from PY is allowed
 TBali: LOL - reminds me never CG in worktime (except if in HO)
 Westicles: PHP is one of the easiest ones
 Westicles: system($str);
 TBali: I decide to complate my The Descent submission in bash with an all inclusive solution&#160;:)
 TBali: the codegolf leaderboard winners code size proove that system() exists from all languages...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i had the wrong command...system() works?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i should mow my lawn before i do something stupid
 TBali: mowing lawnn is stupid. It grows back, no?
 eulerscheZahl: mowing the lawn in the winter?
 TBali: home office lawn
 eulerscheZahl: not even my neighbor does that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: -&gt; Florida
 eulerscheZahl: ah, oh
 eulerscheZahl: US geography isn't my strong side
 TBali: So when you have harsh winter that is 15C
 Westicles: winter haven... well named
 jacek: 15 Coulombs?
 Astrobytes: When you mow your lawn is it a Shaven Haven?
 Astrobytes: (got my coat, left)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: harsh is 30F, hmm guess that's -1C ... wear shorts otherwise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mic drop from Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: i can only hear the mic drop on one side&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: plugging and unplugging the speakers too often because of home office
 eulerscheZahl: now the connection cable suffered
 TBali: Does Teams / Zoom support Dolby 5.1?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea. but when I have 2 speakers and only one of them is producing sound even if it's the same audio signal on both sides...
 Astrobytes: Cheap cable?
 eulerscheZahl: probably, the whole boxes did cost about 15-20 euros
 TBali: if L=="Clojure":s+="java -cp /opt/coderunner/clojure/clojure.jar:/opt/coderunner/clojure/spec.alpha.jar:/opt/coderunner/clojure/core.specs.alpha.jar:/tmp/ clojure.main A\n"
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't plan to unplug them every day when I bought them
 TBali: longest command line out of 26
 TBali: okay it is only long path
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I figured they would throw execs in VMs
 eulerscheZahl: they pretty much do
 Westicles: There is probably a shorter way, I'm not so good with unix
 eulerscheZahl: but the VM contains a whole operating system with all compilers
 eulerscheZahl: they do something similar to docker
 Elisa23: hello
 TBali: how did you reverse engineer the paths? defaults? try and error?
 eulerscheZahl: but their own implementation as they coded it before docker existed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh, there's probably a php snip holding it all together&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: system commands to print system info
 eulerscheZahl: like: which javacprints the compiler path
 Westicles: there is a file in the tmp directory that gives you hints on most of them.  
 TBali: or a node.js with the leftpad lib
 eulerscheZahl: i understand that reference
 TBali: every time I start the IDE it spawns a new VM?
 eulerscheZahl: how to break the internet
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but a full VM of course
 RoboStac: TBali - no, it's a container and not a vm
 eulerscheZahl: CG calls it jail. imagine it like a docker container
 TBali: if I do "cat (just like you in your abuse) - how long will this file last?
 eulerscheZahl: but NOT a full VM
 eulerscheZahl: can't type
 struct: until execution end
 eulerscheZahl: and then Stilgart comes and detaches the process :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 TBali:&#160;?
 TBali: Is he related to CG?

 PatrickMcGinnisII: flock("Stilgar/*.*");
 jacek: the one with timeout issues everywhere?
 TBali: ...which escapes its memory cgroup when it is in a frozen state....
 eulerscheZahl: yes jacek, the timeout issue. one of them
 TBali: Well in the heythey of WinWord 2.0 I opened a doc file with a hex editor. To my horror it included some random memory content from ANOTHER unrelated txt file I was working with at the same time
 TBali: Information leak.... yould have been password memo, etc
 TBali: heythey = heyday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: clipboard
 TBali: Or maybe it was in DOS era don't remember. 
 TBali: No, not clipboard - it just saved uninitialized memory content in the doc file
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ewww, well they tried multiple clipboards, think it had kernel issues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dunno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still, ewww
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, gtg, glhf
 eulerscheZahl: i have multiple clipboards

 TBali:&#160;:-)     moving mouse help the code run faster.I thought it works only with hamsters
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: my perfetcly fine thead.detach leads to the discovery of a real bug in CG's infra
 Stilgart:&#160;:)
 MSmits: using floats instead of doubles in csb boosted sim count by nearly 10%. Does that check out?
 TBali: ddos from inside?
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: it didnt work right away. That epsilon stuff got me. I had it at 0.0001 but with floats that gets rounded to 0
 eulerscheZahl: you demonstrated a bug in the latest version of the linux kernel acutally
 Mac04az: Hello
 Stilgart: MSmits: are you using 10bit prec flotting points&#160;?
 jacek: floats need less memory, so they should be a lil bit faster
 Mac04az:&#160;??????
 MSmits: no idea, i use regular c++ floats, 
 MSmits: they are 32 bit
 eulerscheZahl: more java trolling<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictfp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictfp</a>
 MSmits: but if you have a distance of 1000 and you add +0.00001, its not gonna do anything
 MSmits: so i had to change this to + 1 or get an infinite loop due to edge cases in collisions
 Mac04az: Did you try it at least
 Mac04az:&#160;?
 Mac04az: Hello?
 Stilgart: MSmits: the real question is... why do you add +0.00001&#160;?
 Stilgart: this does not make sense
 MSmits: this is when a bounce in a collision is not completely succesful in pushing two pods apart
 MSmits: if you check the referee, you can see it does this
 Stilgart: ha... PCR
 MSmits: no csb, but same thing
 Mac04az: How do you get to the other pods its not letting me run the code.
 Stilgart: (don't tell me that CSB does this too)
 Stilgart: (don't)
 MSmits: yeah it does
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: :P:
 Stilgart: (don't&#160;:) )
 eulerscheZahl: "large applications that could take an hour to install could be reduced to 15 minutes with suitable mouse input."interesting story jacek :o
 Mac04az: Where do I press to run it
 Astrobytes: Something to do with the win event loop?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: I recall seeing something about it
 Astrobytes: just got jace k's link, nice
 jacek: so i can move the mouse around and make the bot faster
 Astrobytes: lol
 zhoubou: "Install faster!" "I'm trying!" &lt;Wiggles mouse furiously&gt;
 MSmits: i move my mouse all day to make my meta mcts go faster
 Mac04az: Ha
 Mac04az: Where are you going with this
 eulerscheZahl: once a colleague was curious how many meters he's moving his mouse cursor per day and installed a program to track it
 jake1: it's due to os scheduling tasks
 eulerscheZahl: IT security department wasn't happy about the idea :rofl:
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: stop telling people that moving a mouse can make installs faster
 Automaton2000: it just has to be a better choice
 jake1: the scheduler gathers statistics on different things
 jake1: device input is (was?) one of those
 jake1: and re/schedules tasks accordingly
 struct: MSmits you changed epsilon to what?
 AlgoRhythmus: hi
 MSmits: to 1
 MSmits: not sure if thats a good value struct, but it fixed the bug
 MSmits: (the crash)
 struct: I see, I think i just removed one or two zeros
 MSmits: yeah I can always make it smaller again
 MSmits: it's still detecting shield
 MSmits: (when used by opponent)
 MSmits: so I guess the sim is not that far off
 RoboStac: but does the imaginary enemy ever use it?
 MSmits: it says so on the replay :P
 TBali: What is the recommened way of dealing with integers &gt;  (1&lt;&lt;53) in Javascript or Typescript?Some puzzles simple obverflow... 
 RoboStac: I assume using a language that has proper ints isn't a valid suggestion?&#160;:)
 TBali: (too bad I cannot correct my typos in webchat)
 RoboStac: isn't bignum now part of the standard?
 TBali: Th context is translating a puzzle solution to all 27 languages
 TBali: for some puzzles only these 2 missing
 TBali: E.g. Execution Circle
 jacek: why would language support randomly 53 bits ints? is it double thing?
 RoboStac: yeah
 TBali: Same operators, only BigInt() or adding n to literals... nice.. should have googled that
 RoboStac: no integers, only doubles
 TBali: and this language is hugely popular / used...  
 TBali: cannot understand why
 <b>**MSmits shudders</b></p><p><img src="/a/35448723594340" /> jacek: so is english but we dont complain
 TBali: I would switch instantly to Esperanto if all others would do
 TBali: English is at least not worse from learning point of view than any other natural ones.
 TBali: (Also not better)
 TBali: But yeah, all coding languages have their own quirks
 eulerscheZahl: i blame those who tried to build the tower in Babel
 eulerscheZahl: could have saved me from a lot of effort :P
 jacek: what would be the universal programming language?
 eulerscheZahl: Q#
 TBali: If language development had stopped at Ancient Egyptian or Sumerian, we were screwed. At least in writing
 TBali: CG bot contest on quantum computer .... creepy
 MSmits: mmh aren't they already? I thought that's why it crashes all the time on day 1
 TBali:&#160;:)
 TBali: WHat about MMIX?
 MSmits: MMIX?
 TBali: closer to the domain of CG
 TBali: from Knuth Art book
 TBali: pseudocode
 MSmits: Knuth does art?
 TBali: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMIX">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMIX</a>
 TBali: Actually I would not be surprised him doing some real art - really versatile guy (or I don't know what other noun would suffice here, one with showing more respect)
 MSmits: yeah he is also into dancing
 TBali: DLX you mean? lol
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: dlx?
 MSmits: dancing links

 MSmits: that algo we used for number shifting
 eulerscheZahl: play number shifting already!
 eulerscheZahl: oh, too slwo

 MSmits: (jaceks sort dance)
 TBali: creative use of Hungarian folk dance

 Astrobytes: Hungarian folk music is awesome
 Astrobytes: (is that an unpopular opinion?)
 eulerscheZahl: you know my opinion about music
 TBali: Well, YT channel name is AlgoRythmics
 Astrobytes: True euler
 TBali: local folk music is not particularly popular nowadays within the country
 TBali: (or any folk music in this respect)
 Astrobytes: I've seen Csík Zenekar when I lived in London (and a bunch of other Hungarian bands)
 TBali: Interestingly their biggest hit is not a folk song but a rewrite of a song of another band's song in folk style - completely different from the original
 Astrobytes: Csillag vagy fecske?
 Astrobytes: Or most múlik pontosan?
 TBali: Csík version: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh8YrVzD5t4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh8YrVzD5t4</a>
 TBali: Original by Quimby: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbF7VVsKYIw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbF7VVsKYIw</a>
 TBali: being oft, sorry
 Astrobytes: Yeah, when I saw them in London, Kiss Tibor from Quimby was with them for a few songs. Was really cool
 TBali: You know Hungarian music scene quite well
 TBali: any relation?
 Astrobytes: My favourite was a very rare Kispál és a Borz concert
 Astrobytes: No, I have a good friend Ferenc, who introduced me to a lot of good music
 TBali: Quimby and Kispál was  quite the 'alternative' scene in the 90s
 TBali: Also Pál Utcai Fiúk
 TBali: band not the unrelated musical of the same name (named after a literary work)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm familiar&#160;:)Hang és fény by Kispál (for me) remains one of my all time favourite songs. 
 TBali: In 90s I was Bonanza Banzai fan, I learned to love PUF much later. Kispál never really.
 Astrobytes: they were synth-based right?
 Astrobytes: Bonanza Banzai I mean
 TBali: a bit similar to Depeche Mode
 TBali: yes synth
 TBali: ... I know... I grew up since
 Astrobytes: Yeah, synth-pop kinda thing
 TBali: The singer still active as solo
 Astrobytes: I know of them but don't know much of their music
 Astrobytes: PUF are awesome, but I definitely have the most love for Kispál 
 TBali: These 2 are most typical: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRmhSZuHjYQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRmhSZuHjYQ</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeCjLl7jtfY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeCjLl7jtfY</a>
 TBali: my music taste changed but it feels nostalgic
 Astrobytes: Oh yes, definitely Depeche Mode style
 TBali: half of the class wore only black&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: heh heh :D
 TBali: Lovas, the singer/songwriter of Kispál contributed to a funny movie<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118906/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118906/</a>which sets in the 50s communist Hungary - with lots of music
 TBali: makes good fun of the whole era
 TBali: the nonsense that lasted 40 years (for us)
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, I'm familiar with the communist era across central and eastern Europe. It's worth a watch then?
 TBali: it is a light themed film, but fun to watch and good music
 Astrobytes: I'll see if I can track it down, thanks!
 TBali: the kind of humor that works because you know the basis is true
 Astrobytes: Gotcha
 TBali: Quite local, not sure if it is available, I mean legally
 TBali: or with subtitles
 Astrobytes: Oh I'll find it somehow.
 RyanGilbert: :O
 Astrobytes: If I can't get one with subtitles I'll get Ferenc to subtitle it for me :P
 TBali: Musicwise - it is Lovasi style - yet brings in the 60s...
 Astrobytes: That sounds interesting for sure!
 TBali: okay let me  call free() for the World channel
 Astrobytes: lol
 TBali: We had our music malloc()
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Astrobytes: Well, no one else is talking so...

 Astrobytes: I think... perhaps, there are some other music-based puzzles. Not sure
 TBali: if euler's sound contibution counts
 Astrobytes: hah
 Astrobytes: oh and for the record - I still like synth-based music :P
 TBali: My first favourite was Jean Michel Jarre - even before Bonanza
 TBali: we talk about cca 12y old
 TBali: nowadyas my son brings in new music influences
 matez: there was a guy or girl who was leading the Clash for a long time. Where did (s)he disappeared?
 Astrobytes: I liked his Oxygene.I grew up listening to Kraftwerk, OMD, all that kinda stuff as well as rock, blues and jazz
 TBali: For example I never knew metal can be good
 Astrobytes: matez: You mean Allis?
 Astrobytes: TBali: there is a lot of good metal around.
 matez: yes, Allis
 Astrobytes: matez: It seems like he deleted his account earlier today. Not sure why,
 TBali: Strange, why delete? Maybe stop using, but delete?
 TBali: And loosing all the XP and CP 
 matez: Maybe, the game was too easy to him&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Maybe wanted a fresh start?
 TBali: Or does CG work the same way as a casino? On the way out we can convert our CP to real money?
 UncleCat: ：D
 Astrobytes: Interesting idea...
 TBali: But if it would work the same way, then a thug came to me when trying to leave and forcing me to play more
 TBali: Till I lose my fine #300 position on the leaderboard
 matez: at first, you would have to bye the jetons..
 TBali: Can I mine them? with GPU?ú
 Astrobytes: TBali: Prove there was a thug and it wasn't just you coming back for more :P
 matez: hungarian keyboard&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Like we say as kids in Scotland when we get in trouble: "A big boy/girl did it and ran away!"
 TBali: I have a masochist side - every time I hit submit in a multi
 TBali: úőéáűíöüó
 TBali: do this in 1 sec
 TBali: luckily XP cannot decrease... Okay Westicles proved the contrary
 TBali:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *cannot decrease without human intervention
 matez: unfortunately, éáóú can be done only with flying accent 
 TBali: you are over 1 sec&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: I gave up before starting
 matez: not, just the server is slow 8-)
 TBali: that was as unfair as fighting with C++ against my poor interpreted bot
 TBali: matez, you work for Balabit?
 matez: Did
 TBali: There is a Hungarian company with the same name, 
 matez: I do not know other.
 TBali: They made some local headlines by being acquired
 matez: Quest / one identity
 TBali: I had some contact with them long time ago related to their Zorp firewall
 TBali: and syslog NG
 matez: Zorp is managed by balasys now
 TBali: yes I know
 TBali: it was not part of the caquisition asset, I suppose?
 matez: I developed in the zorp group for a short time then in scb
 matez: i think, the target of acquisition was the scb
 TBali: in Budapest?
 matez: 1rst Veszprém, then Budapest
 TBali:&#160;:)
 JAM3S: Hey is anyone there?
 JLukeSkywalker: no
 JLukeSkywalker: how dare you ask
 JAM3S: what language do you recomend for a beginner
 JLukeSkywalker: python
 JLukeSkywalker: on here
 JAM3S: Ok thanks
 JLukeSkywalker: fast coding, short code, no type or variable size issues
 JAM3S: got it, thanks
 JLukeSkywalker: for general use not on here I would recommend a structured OO language like java or c++/C#
 JAM3S: thanks again
 JLukeSkywalker: gl
 VizGhar: wuf... last official hard puzzle guys&#160;:) slowly getting to very hard. I feel like i have achieved something
 JLukeSkywalker: nice! i've only been picking and choosing the puzzles
 PYMASTER: he guys
 PYMASTER: hey
 VizGhar: the puzzles? i dont understand
 VizGhar: maybe Automaton2000 does?
 Automaton2000: how you guys are talking about :d
 JLukeSkywalker: was saying im not like 100%ing them, only picked the ones i liked
 therealbeef: the very hard ones are not very hard. just start with those&#160;:)
 VizGhar: gotcha... I love puzzles a little bit more then bot programming. I wan't to solve them 
 VizGhar: i don't think so... most of them are pretty damn hard
 VizGhar: my hands are shaking looking at nintendo :D
 VizGhar: or vox codei
 therealbeef: i liked the resistance and shadows of the knight 2 ones
 VizGhar: i chose correct but difficult approach for shadows of the knight. Resistance was pretty easy
 VizGhar: Also music scores are pretty easy
 VizGhar: but not much more
 VizGhar: others are really very hard
 VizGhar: even last crusade
 VizGhar: have to sleep bye
 Astrobytes: Nintendo is quite specialised in terms of the mathematical knowledge you need
 VizGhar: yeah... but you can find explanations here and there, what's going on
 VizGhar: (even solutions)
 Astrobytes: There's a youtube video... the guy hired a mathematics professor to help him :D
 Astrobytes: I'm no mathematician and I'm pretty weak in field theory so, that's on my Do Not Attempt list
 Astrobytes: Wouldn't dare to look at a solution as I wouldn't know what was going on tbh.
 VizGhar: mg... hiring matematician...
 VizGhar: I'll try, fail and give up
 VizGhar: but i'll try :D
 VizGhar: ok, have to go. bye
 Astrobytes: It's not impossible!
 Astrobytes: good night&#160;:)
 Twhyzer: I feel bad if i see the enemy solutions and there time while im programming java and they programm python xD
 Astrobytes: In clashes you mean?
 Astrobytes: You can do puzzles instead if you don't want to be beaten on code size or time
 Twhyzer: okay, thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: There's no time limit on puzzles but they are solo - there are also multiplayer games with leagues if you like that
 therealbeef: urgh. missing that batman puzzle extra legend achievement on 1 move -_-

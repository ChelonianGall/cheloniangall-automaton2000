 MSmits: With that article, and well.. you, I feel like I am learning a lot about the Polish&#160;:)
 MSmits: that cactus though.. lol
 MSmits: if anything was singing cocaine rap songs it would have to be a cactus like that
 Marchete: ok, I'm getting Conv2D to work
 Marchete: but it's painfully slow....
 jacek: c4?
 Marchete: any board with neighbours
 Marchete: c4 first
 Marchete: maybe spring challenge later
 Marchete: I precalculate the output per each 1.0 input, and I keep that in a weight[totalInputs]
 Marchete: so this way it's similar to a Dense layer
 Marchete: output = bias + sum(inputVal * weight[inputindex])
 Marchete: but, it's slow...
 jfaixo: in which language Marchete&#160;?
 jfaixo: I am not arrived at the "reimplement the feed forward" part of my journey, but I suppose one will want to look at SIMD optimized implementation
 Marchete: C++
 Marchete: and it has SIMD
 jfaixo: ok&#160;:) long journey incoming&#160;! :D
 jfaixo: just found that paper, i'll add it to me "to read" list&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05567.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05567.pdf</a>,

 anton123401: Hello
 Marchete: my Dense layers seems fast
 Marchete: Conv2D isn't
 KP56: my cpp clock tells me the code has been executed in 95ms, but i still get a timeout...
 KP56: in UTTT
 sprkrd: what are you measuring, wall or user time?
 sprkrd: KP56 clock() or steady_clock::now()?
 Chonapatc: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d33779d-01ea-4eaa-b62d-2a6fd1e37703">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d33779d-01ea-4eaa-b62d-2a6fd1e37703</a>
 KP56: clock()
 KP56: sprkrd
 sprkrd: better use steady_clock::now()
 sprkrd: I think CG measures real time, not CPU time
 sprkrd: with real time measures you will be more conservative
 KP56: ok
 KP56: thanks
 sprkrd: also some people recommend doing 90 ms or so... I've never cared for that, I want my full time budget of 100 ms and I don't get timeouts even if my function takes 100.something ms
 sprkrd: but of course, you may have to consider doing 95 ms or 90 ms if that doesn't work for you
 princess_of_zeal: I was wondering, if there is a C equivalent of steady_clock::now() or would you basically say that one should always use C++ over C for these problems?
 sprkrd: there's an equivalent for C for measuring real time, of course, but I'd say it's platform dependent
 sprkrd: I think gettimeofday is an option?
 sprkrd: but that's just for unix-like systems
 RoboStac: you probably want clock_gettime with CLOCK_MONOTONIC 
 RoboStac: but yeah, theres not a standard way across platforms
 sprkrd: yeah, I'd say clock_gettime is what you wanna go for
 sprkrd: at least for CG
 geppoz: well found another weird JS behaviour :D
 princess_of_zeal: thanks! I basically hate C/C++ and I'm just using it because of performance&#160;;-) any chance Julia is coming to CG?
 KatMan911: Stupid beginner question - can I turn off this chat and take it off my screen for good? I've just started, and the site insists on opening and showing me new things I'm not interested in.
 sprkrd: You hate C/C++? You break my heart
 geppoz: 3599627370496&gt;&gt;38 guess what says JS&#160;?
 sprkrd: KatMan911 yup, append ?disableChat to the end of your URL, dunno why that option isn't more visible
 geppoz: (it is inside the max integer declared 2^52)
 princess_of_zeal: I guess I only hate C++, C is fine ...
 sprkrd: I think I've been told that a few days ago (precisely by RoboStac, if my memory doesn't fail me&#160;:) )
 sprkrd: princess_of_zeal My heart is still broken&#160;:(
 KatMan911: sprkrd - thanks!
 sprkrd: KatMan911 welcome
 Marchete: I've finally added Convolutional 2D to my NN inference, but I think it's sloooooow. 14x slower than simple Dense
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a>
 JosephTheVibin: Hey, new here. How does the input work? Is it just a string with multiple lines&#160;?
 KP56: in the puzzle description you get an information about what data you receive in input
 KP56: if you are using python, input is a string you need to parse
 MSmits: Marchete did you also add those performance improvements you found earlier (for simple dense networks)
 MSmits: I think it was one hot optimization
 HassanAli4651: can any one help me in this?
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: that's really cool, thanks for sharing that
 Marchete: I precalc any conv per input
 Marchete: so each inputs adds some weights to output
 HassanAli4651: The game mode is REVERSE: You do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the following set of tests:
 Marchete: if input ==0.0 it skips
 Marchete: 1.0 is addition
 Marchete: etc.
 KP56: we cannot help you in COC since it would be cheating sorry
 MSmits: makes sense
 HassanAli4651: what
 KP56: you are literally competing against other people
 KP56: we cannot help you
 MSmits: HassanAli4651 coc is competitive
 Marchete: but maybe I'm doing something wrong
 MSmits: if you want help, try doing practice puzzles
 Marchete: anyways I'll plan to use it for a C4 bot
 MSmits: Marchete probably everyone is doing something wrong and it's just a matter of degree&#160;:)
 Marchete: what I have doubts it's how I can add/concatenate non grid inputs
 Marchete: e.g. on spring I have the grid + external values
 MSmits: i dont know enough to give you advice there
 Marchete: those external values shouldn't go into conv
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: well you can skip the layer
 Marchete: I guess adding it after the conv
 MSmits: just pass it to the next layer unchanged
 Marchete: I can't "break" things on c++ if tensorflow doesn't do the same
 MSmits: maybe this eats into the simplicity of the keras model though..
 Marchete: grid inputs -&gt; conv
 Marchete: other inputs-&gt;dense
 Marchete: then concatenate conv+dense
 Marchete: and do a second dense on combined
 Marchete: too messy :confused:
 MSmits: mmh don't you just put everything through conv, but you mask the input thats supposed to go to dense, then everythign goes to dense, but you mask the conv input. You keep the process linear
 Marchete: 2 inputs -&gt; concatenate-&gt;2 outputs
 Marchete: I can have 2 inputs without any problem I guess
 Marchete: inputs are just used when needed
 MSmits: right
 Marchete: I'll tell you once I work on C4
 Marchete: Conv2D are messy
 MSmits: sure
 Marchete: I'm still not sure I implemented it 100% correct
 Marchete: stride, paddings, kernel, etc etc
 Marchete: but... it gives the same output as TF
 MSmits: I'm not sure if C4 is the best place to do this
 Marchete: just as expected
 Marchete: why?
 MSmits: because it's so close to being solved
 MSmits: it's hard to beat non-NN's
 Marchete: solved games are in fact better
 Marchete: simpler to check if the best move is accurate
 Marchete: if you mean it won't go high in leaderboards
 Marchete: then well
 MSmits: thats true, but you're sooner to think your bot failed when in fact it 's just beaten by brute force
 Marchete: it's OK
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: but it's good to test Conv2D
 MSmits: well as long as you go in with that in mind it's fine i guess
 Marchete: it has only grid2D inputs
 Marchete: no score, sun or whatever
 MSmits: well you have to know whose turn it is, unless you flip it, which you should
 MSmits: then you lose that input requiremebnt
 Marchete: I'll flip, as in oware
 MSmits: good
 Marchete: I just need what to do about steal
 MSmits: oware can be done scoreless too
 MSmits: but it's messy
 Marchete: I hate oware with "passion"
 Marchete: I don't want to touch it anymore
 MSmits: hehe not me, I am indifferent to the game
 Marchete: rules are cancer
 MSmits: well that's only annoying when you need to write the sim, once thats done its np
 Marchete: even Robo had some endgame issues until recently
 MSmits: oh right, the last turn issue
 Marchete: no, it's not
 Marchete: you may think it's OK
 Marchete: but maybe it's not
 MSmits: mmh maybe
 MSmits: but that's mostly due to the way it's implemented on CGT
 MSmits: CG
 MSmits: with the turn limit
 MSmits: that makes it messy
 Marchete: I needed to DL a lot of replays, parse them and validate vs my simulation
 MSmits: for training I dont need it to be accurate
 Marchete: C4 seems simple
 MSmits: at least in regard to turn limit
 Marchete: simulate(move)
 Marchete: check if isEndgame()
 Marchete: no other BS
 MSmits: you don't have "turns left" as input right?
 Marchete: no
 MSmits: then for training, the sim doesnt need to be turn-sensitive
 Marchete: this can be problematic
 Marchete: but well
 MSmits: well i've proved many times over that turnsleft matters a lot
 MSmits: it gives different "best moveS"
 MSmits: but the search can fix it
 MSmits: if you go deep enough
 MSmits: so for eval you probably dont need it
 MSmits: also endgame book fixes part of it
 Marchete: I think I don't go deep enough
 MSmits: well at the end you may
 Marchete: I've seen loops that at start seemed a good move
 Marchete: and in the end it was a loss
 Marchete: you know
 Marchete: those cycles with low seeds
 MSmits: yeah, it only needs +2 seeds or so and it's a loss. Since the game is near to or exactly solved as draw...
 Marchete: that just rotates
 MSmits: yes, but i solve those with endgame book if they are totalling &lt;= 9 seed
 Marchete: I don't
 MSmits: i have also seen the other NN's mess up there
 MSmits: but usually they dont
 MSmits: just sometimes
 Marchete: mine does
 Marchete: I waste first turn building up MCTS trees with visits
 Marchete: to further turns
 MSmits: is this jacekmax or ept btw?
 MSmits: do you average or max?
 Marchete: no, A0 like
 Marchete: average
 MSmits: thats ept i think
 Marchete: similar
 MSmits: well with policy i guess
 MSmits: but the value is ept
 MSmits: makes more sense to me
 MSmits: I have to start using my 36 seed book still. It's pretty difficult to incorporate it in meta mcts book free
 MSmits: turn free i mean
 MSmits: my current meta mcts incorporates the turn
 MSmits: but i will get loops now that select the same node
 Marchete: will you do RL then?
 MSmits: supervised yeah
 MSmits: based on meta mcts 48-37, 36 seed book at 36-10
 MSmits: the last 9 are unnecessary
 MSmits: the hard part will mostly be what states to pick for training
 MSmits: and in what proportion
 MSmits: getting the values should be easy
 Marchete: do you keep count of states?
 Marchete: or visits
 MSmits: in meta mcts the nodes will have visit counts yes
 MSmits: the endgame book is just a list of all possible states with their values on perfect play
 MSmits: (expected maximum seed score)
 MSmits: it seems complicated that i have all the states, but they're not all states that would often occur in games
 MSmits: so maybe I would have to randomly create games that select from the available states using some probability of picking worse moves
 MSmits: even picking from endgame book this way, finishing games down to 9 seeds
 Marchete: worse moves for what?
 MSmits: for expected seed gain (player - opponent)
 MSmits: so one move is 0, another is -2 etc.
 MSmits: so 0 has the highest probability
 MSmits: and then there's some decay for worse moves
 MSmits: I eliminate score from the equation so it's all based on the maximum net seed gain
 MSmits: I can use the network and just add player - opponent score to it
 MSmits: because this represents the past gains
 MSmits: in a sense this is what you guys are doing as well. You are using the score as input and this is combined in some way to maximize the score. Because that's all you're doing. Maximizing score = maximizing win probability
 MSmits: i just take it out of the network and add it outside of it
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: my approach is different
 MSmits: but you input score right?
 Marchete: I don't have a solved game
 MSmits: it has to evaluate the board so it has to combine the value for the score with the value of the board somehow
 Marchete: if I had a "solved" game, I can just add a value 1/-1 and a policy with 1.0 on the best move
 Marchete: and fully train that
 MSmits: that might be worse in some way though
 MSmits: not all wins are the same
 MSmits: winning by +2 seeds should be less good than winning by +10 seeds
 jacek: its kinda the same. we just dont have the luxury of perfect score
 MSmits: no, but you dont want your bot to give away score
 MSmits: otherwise it will weaken its position
 MSmits: there has to be some gradual increase from worse states to best states
 MSmits: well maybe the search can fix that because you average
 MSmits: jacekmax wont do this though
 MSmits: it's kinda like what re curse mentioned in his totozero bot, once it knew it lost, it stopped trying sometimes
 MSmits: if it could somehow recognize the difference between states where he loses by a lot and states where he loses by a little, he could crawl back up
 MSmits: the netscore-as-value thing can do this for you, at least in some games
 MSmits: I have read papers  that said that this was worse in games like D&amp;B for example, but I think that conclusion does not translate to every other board game
 jacek: d&amp;b is all or nothing
 MSmits: yeah, the nim game is central
 MSmits: with some exceptions for games that are close
 MSmits: I think score also doesnt work as a good evaluator in othello, since the score flips so much during the game
 MSmits: pretty meaningless
 stivens: Hi. Do you have any idea why Im getting such error when uploading contribution? """parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 10Generated id: """.

 BlaiseEbuth: Your attitude?
 TipuTare: sorry
 TipuTare: but can you tell me

 TipuTare: its the puzzle pwoer of thor episode 1
 BlaiseEbuth: So that's not the problem...
 TipuTare: it needs to get to  a specific location
 TipuTare: but in test case number 2 its going down instead of up
 JohnyDaison: Well, does y increase in south direction or in north direction?
 TipuTare: it goes south instead of north
 jacek: because you print S instead of N?
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 jacek: and you have something like initial_ty = initial_tx - 1
 jacek: is this alright?
 TipuTare: i messed the ifs
 TipuTare: it should be &lt; 0 to go south
 jacek: thats not the only problem
 BlaiseEbuth: Right. It's in python

 TipuTare: nope
 TipuTare: like

 TipuTare: oh
 sprkrd: also, my I suggest something, TipuTare... you're doing thor_position - light_position. Usually (at least for me) you want to think the opposite way (target - your_position). It's easir to think of a vector that goes from where you are to where you want to go than of a vector that goes from your target to yourself
 sprkrd: may I suggest*

 punter147: hello all, i had a doubt on the sokoban puzzle problem. rn i am using A* search and have cooked up what should in principle work. Should i be finding the solution in the 10s alloted in the beginning or should i also use the 50ms time allowed in the later turns? In other words, should any good AI converge and find the solution in the allotted 10s?
 Wontonimo: Good question punter147.  I haven't attempted <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/sokoban">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/sokoban</a>
 Westicles: People have been doing it in a few ms, depending on language
 Westicles: Most doing BFS
 Wontonimo: do you know if it's common to use a hash of previous configs to remove duplicate states?
 Westicles: I don't think so.  Mostly just some pruning if time is an issue
 geppoz: Wontonimo yes
 geppoz: in this game it makes no sense to be in same state 2 times, where state is pusher+block positions
 geppoz: (so I just don't add to the tree a state already explored)
 geppoz: punter147 I think everyone solved all in first turn, then playback the solution, I wonder if someone really explore during next turns...
 Westicles: man, look at that guy.  17 contribs
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup and all above a 0 score.
 BlaiseEbuth: Except one that has 0.

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Happy Blow Shit up day!
 Westicles: Many people don't know this, but the USA is actually the oldest country on the planet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, so we are doomed to fail then
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think france is 7 years older
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hence their support
 PatrickMcGinnisII: *shrug* Not a history person
 Westicles: oh, not really.  I was just trying to get the euros stirred up so I can ask golf questions
 geppoz: someone would say that some sioux tribe would have been older if... :D
 Westicles: Well, actually those guys came 2nd and killed the first wave guys.
 pci: Sokoban is giving me trouble 3-4 and 3-5 timeout... all others pass.. wish I could see the final time to see how close I am.
 geppoz: you could launch on your computer with same input
 pci: when I run sim on my computer it's 7-seconds... not sure how my PC compares to the server.
 pci: I can time all the others and they are 2-seconds or less on the server... thought it was strange these two stand out.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well there's 30 test cases on sokoban
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did it in php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: test case 27 is the longest
 pci: my solver does 27 in 0.4 seconds... must be something weird about my algorithm... but just a simple wide path search
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do you hash explored boards?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if not you are probably re-exporing bad solution leafs
 pci: Yeah... I'm using C# which probably isn't helping, but think I'm pretty optimized with no dynamic memory.
 pci: HashSet&lt;ulong&gt; encoding player position and boxes in ulong
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it is a straight BFS w/ a hash, worked for me, php is slow compared to c#
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my time on server using php on test case 27 is exe time:3.4612550735474
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not using recursion
 pci: maybe my invalid move check is too simple... pushing boxes into walls, boxes and corners
 PatrickMcGinnisII: precompute a map with valid box positions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe speed it up, but still should run faster than 10 seconds
 Runner87: how many slow is python than c++?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on how good you are, but i would say 3 to 6 times slower
 pci: I do precompute bool[] Wall -- but check box offsets for each step
 Runner87: Sokoban BFS test case over 10 takes 45 seconds&#160;! Maybe I do something wrong
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well boxes can't be in a corner, and a few other places
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you have an recursion in there, get rid of it...  you can explore the entire breadth of the tree at each depth quite easily, I think all of them solve in under 200k nodes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: total
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think i counted them at one point, i think one testcase was 129k board states
 PatrickMcGinnisII: easily doable in 10 seconds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my board is one linear array of 121 bytes.  hashset of boxes and player loc in a ulong should be fine as well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I spent alot of time with sokoban, like a week ... so don't get discouraged
 jacek: i thought it was doable in 10 seconds?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: actually in C++ prolly 1 second, but i used php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smart alec
 pci: I am doing a breath first search... I'll keep at it, might covert to C++ to see if that helps.
 pci: breadth?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: breadth and butter
 pci: I'll try holding breath... I can do 10 seconds.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just did "Cosmic Love" overkilled it with BCMATH, smh...oh well.  i'm done for today. glhf.

 mao_fujita: Can somebody explain how the Parse SQL Queries work here? I'm brand new to CodinGame and confused by what to submit for SQL.
 BlaiseEbuth: You mean the puzzle "parse sql querries"&#160;?
 mao_fujita: yes
 mao_fujita: I didn't find the SQL in the language
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't have to use sql
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to write an 'interpretor' for sql
 mao_fujita: I'm using python 3. So in this case, just print out what is in the sql table?
 BlaiseEbuth: In function of the given request yes
 mao_fujita: but print(table_row) only prints from the second line of the table.
 mao_fujita: I'm really confused here.
 mao_fujita: Also, is there a way to do the real SQL practices?
 BlaiseEbuth: No sql on the site no.
 mao_fujita: Ok, thanks.
 punter147: hello all, its me again, i was wondering what is the heuristic yall used in sokoban? i used the manhattan distances of the closest not taken target for each box
 BlaiseEbuth: About table_row, that's normal. The variable is overwritten each turn of the loop.
 BlaiseEbuth: In all the puzzles you have to store the given data by yourself.
 mao_fujita: I mean it starts from printing out the 2nd row but not the first.
 mao_fujita: well, the problem now is how to print out the table_header
 sprkrd: punter147 most people (me included) don't use any heuristic at all
 sprkrd: in fact, if the heuristic is too heavy, it may do more bad than good
 BlaiseEbuth: I understood what you said mao_fujita. But you don't understood what I said. :p
 punter147: sprkrd oh do you use bfs? i am starting to question why i chose A* now :sweat_smile:
 mao_fujita: BlaiseEbuth I think I get your point, my question now is about the table_header. 
 mao_fujita: I know the overwriting thing, just confused about how to print out the table_header.
 sprkrd: punter147 yup, bfs with some pruning&#160;:)
 punter147: sprkrd wow, i guess i will start implementing bfs on the side. Thanks for the tip!
 BlaiseEbuth: mao_fujita take a look to the "input" section at the end of the statement. I think you don't understand how the inputs are given.
 mao_fujita: ok, I'll look at it again, but thanks.
 sprkrd: punter147 you can press on doing heuristic search if you really like, it's not impossible but it's harder
 sprkrd: you sounded like you were describing the quadratic assignment problem, which is a well-known heuristic for sokoban (in fact, there are not many effective heuristics for sokoban...): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_assignment_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_assignment_problem</a>
 sprkrd: sorry, not the quadratic assignment problem, it's just the assignment problem: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem</a>
 Westicles: two sided BFS search is most common
 eulerscheZahl: I just reused my sokoban solver I wrote for sokobanonline.com
 eulerscheZahl: still in top100 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/eulerschezahl">https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/eulerschezahl</a>
 sprkrd: two sided BFS is hard if you don't know the final position of your character, isn't it? Westicles
 eulerscheZahl: there aren't that many final positions
 eulerscheZahl: you just have multiple possible final states and expand all of them at once
 sprkrd: and that works better?
 eulerscheZahl: haven't tried, but i think it does
 eulerscheZahl: tree size possibly explodes, the deeper you go
 eulerscheZahl: (not for the testcases here on CG, these are relatively simple)
 sprkrd: theoretically it should expand fewer states, but there are a few hidden constants here and there that may make it worse for smaller problems
 sprkrd: I believe it should be better on the long run, though
 eulerscheZahl: CG levels are toy problems, I didn't want to make it too hard
 Westicles: yeah, two-sided came into play for an optim where you had to design longest paths.  those had around a thousand turns and I had to anneal around it
 sprkrd: I wouldn't say the ones in CG are the easiest ones, tho
 eulerscheZahl: you did that for another website too Westicles? did Al Zimmerman host such a contest?
 eulerscheZahl: my solver failed on most of the official sokoban levels
 eulerscheZahl: too many boxes
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl thanks for nerd sniping me with that link (sokobanonline.com)
 eulerscheZahl: but it's for human players actually
 Westicles: not AlZ, but a similar setup
 eulerscheZahl: i just wrote a small script but then stopped after reading their terms of service
 eulerscheZahl: i found another sokoban website. but that one had no server-side verification of your solution, so I just placed 1st with 1 move takes to solve a level. was too easy :D
 sprkrd: ah, ok, so you didn't solved 1500+ sokoban levels by hand
 eulerscheZahl: only 2 or 3 to understand how to automate it
 eulerscheZahl: and I did not solve 1500 levels in just 5h :P
 eulerscheZahl: compare that to the profile of the player right above me: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/puri2725">https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/puri2725</a>
 eulerscheZahl: play time: 11 days to reach such a score
 eulerscheZahl: and some non-optimal solutions. that gold trophy means that mine is the shortest path
 sprkrd: oh god
 eulerscheZahl: if i would keep going and climb the ranks, i'd probably just get banned :D
 sprkrd: you also tackled the ones with portals, magnets, twins and all those fancy things?
 eulerscheZahl: and i failed to submit proper web requests (weird API), so I sent key presses to move the player, then close the tab and open the next level in a new tab
 eulerscheZahl: no, just the standard levels
 punter147: sprkrd damn, and here i am trying to find a good heuristic function. I will start investing in breadth and butter :joy:
 princess_of_zeal: Trying the Sokoban puzzle as well now - it feels like Bender - Episode 4 light&#160;:-)
 princess_of_zeal: boxes instead of garbage balls and a pusher / bender ...
 eulerscheZahl: bender was never supposed to be hard to solve, it's an optim game&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>that's the hard one
 Astrobytes: didn't hacker.org have a sokoban-ish game?
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean pusher-boy? very different
 BlaiseEbuth: The best in sokoban is ban
 Astrobytes: hence the -ish
 eulerscheZahl: no, the best is "soko"
 eulerscheZahl: short for Sonderkommission
 eulerscheZahl: some special police unit in German
 princess_of_zeal: freilich
 BlaiseEbuth: Like the ss&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: Godwin point reached!
 Westicles: you can make soko2 with this one
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://sokoban-gild.com/podiumlev.cgi?which=R2_21">http://sokoban-gild.com/podiumlev.cgi?which=R2_21</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that would break a lot of CG constraints
 eulerscheZahl: so, Abalone
 BlaiseEbuth: The best in abalone is alone
 eulerscheZahl: i considered porting that too, was a bit worried that it would be too tie-heavy
 eulerscheZahl: but now we get it, cool
 Astrobytes: With the German and Belgian Daisy starting positions I believe it reduces chance of draws
 Astrobytes: Also, they've made a few modifications to it that I cannot remember right this second
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I would have used
 eulerscheZahl: read the wikipedia about different starting positions
 eulerscheZahl: when i was a child, I had that abalone PC game that I liked to play
 Astrobytes: I suggested it to DomiKo yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: but was a demo version, just valid for 14 days
 Astrobytes: I had loads of games like that, some you could get around some not
 eulerscheZahl: also had some mode modes. like holes in the middle of the board, on some cells
 eulerscheZahl: more modes*
 Astrobytes: That's interesting
 Westicles: someone needs to port that kingkiller trilogy game...TAK?
 BlaiseEbuth: This site more and more looks like this shelf full of board game you stand in front of, unable to decide what to play, to finally decide to play nothing...
 Astrobytes: Be the change you want to see! :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. This shelf need a big clean up.
 sprkrd: BlaiseEbuth For instance?
 Astrobytes: Still think some kind of categorical separation would be nice
 eulerscheZahl: so 1 star votes to every game to get them removed by CG bot? :evil:
 eulerscheZahl: :imp:
 BlaiseEbuth: Already done
 sprkrd: which games do you consider the worst?
 Westicles: one of my clashes got relegated today.  I thought it was a nice one
 eulerscheZahl: i agree, more categories could help. also for community puzzles: easy, mediam, hard, expert, community
 eulerscheZahl: and a chance for community to get promoted to the official sections if they are good enough
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I agree with the puzzles too
 jacek: 1 star for onitama?
 BlaiseEbuth: Westicles: It was probably more complicated than a + b...
 eulerscheZahl: no, onitama is fine as a tutoriakl
 sprkrd: oh ok, if you mean for puzzles, yeah, big cleanup needed, but I don't think there's any multi that should go away?
 Astrobytes: sprkrd: blaise was just being moany
 sprkrd: Astrobytes :grin:
 sprkrd: I think having all these games here is good even for AI research
 BlaiseEbuth: 0.1% consideration...
 Astrobytes: heh
 eulerscheZahl: just some sub-categories for multis maybe. e.g. board games
 Astrobytes: And yeah sprkrd, it's a really strong point of CGs platform
 Astrobytes: Yep, board, physics, maze/grid or something. Would possibly encourage development of non-board games too
 BlaiseEbuth: Good idea ez&#160;! Lets put 99% of the multi in this category.
 sprkrd: tha's not a bad idea
 sprkrd: it's not 99%
 sprkrd: maybe most games are board games, but it's definitively not a 99%
 Westicles: You get legend in one multi and that's like top 2000?
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh satan... People that don't get second degree...
 jacek: hm?
 Westicles: I can't figure out how pardo runs c code from go with only 42 characters overhead.  Quite the puzzler
 Wontonimo: more like top 5000 I think Westicles
 katanaut: guys, can someone tell me, how do I print consecutive actions In games?  I'm getting this error all the time: ``` your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction```
 KiwiTae: its a warning
 katanaut: do i need to use a setInterval-like function?
 KiwiTae: it means u wrote your output before reading all the lines in cin
 punter147: katanaut do you read all the input described in the input section? 
 katanaut: For example, i'm playing now Fall Action 2020 where i need to brew two potions. Which output i need to read before brewing second potion/taking second action?
 KiwiTae: just check default code parsing 
 KiwiTae: uff pcr seem so rand
 KiwiTae: oupsi im boosting the boss ~
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: Oo
 BlaiseEbuth: OO
 Wontonimo: oO
 punter147: oo
 BlaiseEbuth: Wontonimo -&gt; []
 Wontonimo: sigh ... 
 KiwiTae: Promoootion hehe
 Wontonimo: where to Kiwi
 KiwiTae: silver pokerchip
 KiwiTae: with my broken sim&#160;:"=
 Wontonimo: broken sim &gt; no sim
 KiwiTae: truuue
 Wontonimo: what algo you throwing at piker?
 Wontonimo: *pokerchip
 KiwiTae: I swapped full random beams to GA
 KiwiTae: and eval with area i control 
 DomiKo: fix your sim first
 Wontonimo: area of the board, or area of your chips surface?
 KiwiTae: of my chips
 KiwiTae: DomiKo im trying but im retarded ~ i gotta read through the referee again
 DomiKo: it isn't easy 
 Wontonimo: later
 DomiKo: wasn't for me at least
 KiwiTae: oh turned out 1st in silver ~ i might just resubmit and hope for the best
 KiwiTae: maybe add a check for winnin frame so i just pass WAIT if i cant loose anymore

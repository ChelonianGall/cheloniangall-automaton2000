 jacek: amazons puzzle of the week :tada:
 xxd: @martinpapa69, yeah, we figured it out, it was uninitialized. it's odd because I could've sworn struct members get default initialized to the "0" value...
 akashhuyaar: how to understand that ai of coders strike back gamei can't understand the problem exactly fr
 xxd: Do you have a question about the rules or are you asking how their bot AI works
 akashhuyaar: how it works
 Uljahn: you mean under the hood? you send the bot code, it gets executed, then you receive JSON replay back to be shown in the browser visualizer
 Uljahn: also there is a game engine (a referee) which generates inputs for bots depending on its outputs, so your task is to write a program which reads inputs and outputs some commands
 Uljahn: you should implement some logic to make these commands sensible, that is called AI
 Hmode: system out println ("1");
 Hmode: thats all i did!!!!!!
 akashhuyaar: ohhh cool @Uljahn 
 OldJohn: @martinpapa69 What are you testing, you were so much more successfull last week&#160;?

 martinpapa69: i worked on quantized nn inference last week. still buggy i think. or just bad parameters
 OldJohn: quantized&#160;?
 Uljahn: is it QAT or post-processing?
 OldJohn: Do you have a reference&#160;?
 martinpapa69: qat. i train ith tflite

 OldJohn: Ok thanks I 'll take a look even if I am using pytorch&#160;:-)
 martinpapa69: did you add some smart stuff to your bot or just lucky parameters?
 OldJohn: Mostly optimization
 martinpapa69: how many rollouts do you have in 50ms&#160;?
 OldJohn: more than 9000 in the opening
 OldJohn: up to 50000 in the ending
 martinpapa69: nice. 4k at start here
 martinpapa69: nn size? i have 128-&gt;64
 OldJohn: actually the first layer here is 88&#160;:-)
 derjack: oh my
 martinpapa69: the input layer 88&#160;?
 martinpapa69: or the first dense
 OldJohn: Input 291
 martinpapa69: ok
 martinpapa69: ye my nn might be a bit too big. but it worked with the float version
 OldJohn: But the input is sparse so the matrix vector can be optimized
 derjack: yay for one hots
 martinpapa69: ye, i have precalct the input*first_layer
 martinpapa69: as the input is always 1.0
 OldJohn: Exactly
 OldJohn: the matrix vector is then very optimized (that is my main job in real life)
 OldJohn: Even if normally I use the mkl library
 martinpapa69: nice. I too have avx matrix multiplication. but for some reason its not much faster than my float one
 OldJohn: It should be, you can use Intel oneapi tools to understand why it is not
 OldJohn: I was so surprised o how bad compilers are on dotproduct
 OldJohn: and if the size of the matrix is big, blockind may be necessary
 OldJohn: Even for matrix/vector
 martinpapa69: no idea what is that
 martinpapa69: i just copied my code from here

 Wontonimo: Izzy90, usually you do that offline
 Wontonimo: by using 10,000's of games
 owenmelbz: just found this website, but confused as to what it's trying to do. Is it learning how to code games? or just learn code via gaming quizes?
 AntiSquid: hey Automaton2000 what's up&#160;?
 Automaton2000: cant see it in the ide
 Wontonimo: hey owenmelbz, there are several things on this site.  The bot battles like coders strikes back are fun ways of seeing how you are able to code and problem solve compared to other people
 Wontonimo: different bot battles have different problems, and not physics bases.  Connect 4 and Ultimate Tic Tac Toe are examples of classic board games with no physics
 Q12: Hey, does someone have a good algo for learning spells in the beginning of game in Fall Challenge 2020? this would help a lot
 Hunter64TheOne: hello
 Wontonimo: Q12 I haven't entered that game until just now
 Wontonimo: what have you tried so far?
 technoindiangamerg: hi
 technoindiangamerg: 0x0x0x0x
 Wontonimo: hi
 Q12: learning the first spells in list to get opponent blue ingredients,learning the highest spell by value I can learn (the value for each ingrdient is his tear + 1)
 Q12: creating cycles, which means that from each ingredient you have a spell to convert to each other ingredient
 Q12: as much cycles as I can
 Q12: all of those options have a limited number of learns

 holite: Mario is marching to the castle to save the princess. In the last phase he has to jump over a number of pillars of different heights. When Mario jumps from a lower pillar to a higher pillar, he has to use High Jump. When he jumps to a pillar of lower or same height, he has to use Low Jump.Your task is to find out how many High Jumps and Low Jumps Mario has to do.
 holite: quiet diificult&#160;:(
 holite: can you give the python or cpp code for this "raiz_rizon".
 KiwiTae: aint hard though u just need to diff  and count pos and neg in the array
 holite: ok gotcha

 jacek: and the mcts works in normal board?
 jacek: no sign errors?
 xxd: that must be it, i changed the backpropagation code for no reason to try and optimize it

 jacek: oO
 xxd: what do you guys use to increment
 xxd: i think wontonimo does +2 for win, +1 for tie, and +0 for lose
 jacek: normally is 1, 0, -1
 xxd: ok
 xxd: was just wondering how that would affect UCB1
 Scarfield: i use 1, 0.5, 0. but remember to adjust the ucb so it "fits"
 jacek: maybe not so bad, winning is highest, losing is lowest, but the range is changed
 jacek: perhaps adjust exploration only
 jacek: but after enough iterations it should converge even with crappy exploration

 Wontonimo: okay, i just tried it.  I didn't have any issues
 Wontonimo: did you pass all the test cases with a generic solution MACKEYTH&#160;?
 Dohmanlechx: Can someone give me a hint about how to calculate the step between turns for the Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1 puzzle game?
 Dohmanlechx: I guess some kind of formula where I use the count of windows and the max jumps Batman is allowed to make
 Wontonimo: how about just dividing the board given the U D L R
 Wontonimo: you should be able to just divide the x axis in half and and the y axis in half every turn
 Dohmanlechx: Thanks
 MACKEYTH: @Wontonimo Yes, several different solutions actually
 MACKEYTH: I'm breaking the key down with String.split(" ")
 Wontonimo: yeah, i don't do that
 Wontonimo: because it doesn't handle the " " between " " break
 MACKEYTH: I also tried Scanner.read() ing 26 times. Both worked on the test cases.
 Wontonimo: how are you handling the space with split(" ")&#160;?
 elderlybeginner: i have some issue with power and speed in fantastic bits
 elderlybeginner: during throw, should I consider mass of the ball? e.g. ...
 Wontonimo: are you doing a sim elderly?
 Wontonimo: or just a if/else bot?
 elderlybeginner: when wizzards goes 200, power of throw is 500, what will be the speed of the ball?
 elderlybeginner: kind of evaluation. I'm trying to get proper throw angle, I tryied to calculate it basing on sine theorem, but I see that 500 + wizzard_speed cannot be taken as a ball speed after a throw
 Wontonimo: that feels like something you could use stderr to print out when you recreate a similiar situation in the game, then make that a test case for yourself for reverse engineering the equation
 Wontonimo: is the equation not in the problem statement of the game?
 elderlybeginner: I have equation, thou it need ball/snaffle speed.
 elderlybeginner: and e.g. wizzard is moving 343 when grabbing the ball (snaffle), slowing down (according to friction 0.75) to 257 when it's going to throw, but the ball gets the speed of almost 1500
 elderlybeginner: ok, maybe it's power = 1/2 * (mass * velocity **2)
 elderlybeginner: but that would be even less
 Wontonimo: some game data would be valuable 
 Wontonimo: including the power of the throw,
 Wontonimo: the next turn vx vy of the snaffle

 elderlybeginner: ah, links problem&#160;;)
 elderlybeginner: I'm looking for connection between: power, velocity and mass during the ball is thrown
 Wontonimo: got a second data point?
 Wontonimo: from this, all we can say is power 500 = 1463
 Wontonimo: which, by the way is 1950*0.75
 Wontonimo: so, for all we know the velocity is ( power*4 - 50 )*0.75
 Wontonimo: or power * 3.9 * 0.75
 Wontonimo: need another couple data points to rule out different equations
 elderlybeginner: ok, counting
 elderlybeginner: power 100: gives 531power 200: gives 725power 300: gives 924I will need to throu it straight, as now there is an angle which can decrease maximal speed
 Wontonimo: or also collect that data
 elderlybeginner: power 400: gives 1094power 500: gives 1318as the throu is not perfectly in line of wizzard movement, speed of the ball is lower
 elderlybeginner: i guess I have to throw it stright
 Wontonimo: or not and just record all the data
 Wontonimo: put it all into a spreadsheet
 Wontonimo: including the speed of the thrower during the throw
 RoboStac: if you've got the wizard thrust working it's exactly the same (other than half mass). When thrown it has the speed of the wizard and then gets a thrust of up to 500 in the direction thrown
 Wontonimo: and the target throw

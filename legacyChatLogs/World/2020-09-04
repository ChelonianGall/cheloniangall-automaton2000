 mr.mister: which browser do you prefer? Chrome or Firefox?
 mr.mister: Don't care about others, tbh
 mr.mister: Specially not about Safari :P
 stanleyipkiss: chrome i always try to switch to firefox but i cant commit 
 stanleyipkiss: damn memory hog, sometimes netflixs only works on firefox
 wdd3975: NN[]
 Supernooby: ELLO WORLD
 Ashen_024: chrome eats up the ram like some cookie in chocolate syrup so Firefox would be the choice, but i think chrome is faster too so it depends on your choice
 Supernooby: WOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOO
 Supernooby: ITS 3 AM 
 Supernooby: :joy:
 Ashen_024: NICE :joy:

 anantaCodes: Once a clash is over, is there any specific reason why the problem statement atleast is not shown? Would be good because I want to attempt to the unsolved problems
 Uljahn: how do you attempt to the specific problem if clashes are random?
 anantaCodes: I want to re attempt a clash problem on my own in my local machine 
 anantaCodes: How do I get the problem statement eg. for a clash from 2 days back which I wasn't able to solve
 Uljahn: you can try to find the statement here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Uljahn: there is no straightforward way to access a clash from the past
 Q12: Can I read a char type in the Stub generator input?Like this:read Character:char
 SPDene: character isn't a type in the stub language - see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/stub-generator-syntax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/stub-generator-syntax</a>just read a string of length 1
 Q12: OK, thanks.
 Q12: read Character:charthis will be more specific
 Uljahn: will it be better for all the languages? :thinking:
 Q12: I don't know but I understand what you're saying, I think it worth checking:slight_smile:
 SPDene: many languages don't have a "character" type, so it's going to get converted to a string anyway. Suggest it on the forum if you feel strongly about it
 arthurguedes: gogogocome on
 SaadAmrani:&#160;!
 JaMal: hhh
 anantaCodes: Is Rank 7 with 20% accuracy and Rank 7 with 100% accuracy considered same for overall personal points?
 SaadAmrani:&#160;!!!
 JaMal: jkjd
 Tiramon: anantaCodes accuracy in what?
 anantaCodes: @Tiramon All test cases pass - 100% vs  some test cases pass
 Tiramon: so you are propably talking about clash of coderank does not matter anywhereand in coc best results for the testcases is most important ... for more details depending on kind of clash time/size is also important
 Tiramon: at least as you are talking about the level in CG
 Tiramon: for the calculation of the codin points you get for a clash the TrueSkill algo is used so it only matters what rank he has in the highscore and if you beat him or not (better coverage and faster/shorter)

 RobertSaunders: any tips or any other metrics i may want to try to sort the target priority

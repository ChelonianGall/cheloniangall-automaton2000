 ChampionCoder: If you think about it, there is nothing more satisfying than watching all those CoC test cases go green
 ChampionCoder: ON THE VERY FIRST CODE TESTING
 ChampionCoder: Ahh, I love that feeling...
 ChampionCoder: :p
 DaNinja: Hi Nixerrr I deleted my comment on the cultist wars forum after realising I misread the bresenham code.
 eulerscheZahl: nixer isn't online at the moment
 DaNinja: musta just missed him
 NicatSadiqov: hi 
 jacek: good morning

 Deathmonk: anyone up for a challenge?
 artmyros: i how only python:(
 artmyros: know
 artmyros: not how but know
 Deathmonk: all languages are allowed in the above link
 artmyros: ok im there

 Deathmonk: another challenge...anyone?
 SPDene: deathmonk CoC invites should be posted in the #clash channel, not here
 jrke: deathmonk i will suggest to paste link #clash here which just for clash
 Deathmonk: sorrry
 ProgrammerDog: idu
 jacek: oO
 robol88: hey
 ilvghst: hiii
 Thyl: hey
 jacek: good afternoon
 Yumiko: good afternoon
 MSmits: mediocre afternoon
 MSmits: for a change
 jacek: c-c-c-combo breaker?
 MSmits: or that
 Yumiko: :grimacing:
 Knee-Gears: smiths hello
 NguyenDinhDuong: f
 NguyenDinhDuong: df
 NguyenDinhDuong: fsd
 NguyenDinhDuong: f
 BigusRedus: a?
 eulerscheZahl: stop it
 GriM: Does anyone know why I can't see the ship moving on coders strike back?
 Thosquey: try refreshing
 GriM: Can anyone let me know what the c# debug line is?
 GriM: I deleted it and I can't rmember how you do it :c
 GriM: nevermind
 masoodahm: I am terrible at programming
 jacek: oh my
 Tailsray: Same xd
 Tailsray: But it doesn't matter as long as I like it :3
 jacek: thats the spirit
 eulerscheZahl: i should remember that for the recruiter
 jacek: CG interview?
 jp007: hllo 
 jacek: good evening
 Westicles: CG interview: We'd like to hire you, but you're sort of already doing it for free
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't understand their business model. the part of the website that is visible to us is just creating costs, isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: i know they have a recruiting platform as well. but organizing a contest where millions of games get played, that must cost a bit. also the working time to create the game in the first place
 Westicles: Kind of like stores that sell novelty soaps.  I just assume they are all money laundering fronts
 jacek: laundering using soap?
 Westicles: oO
 struct: Well contests before were sponsored
 struct: now I dont know how it works
 eulerscheZahl: i remember the tiles of sponsored contests
 eulerscheZahl: personally i wasn't actively looking for a job but many users seemed to like it
 eulerscheZahl: some found a job that way
 Epic_Coder: hello
 jacek: meh i thought it would be more crowdy druing christmas/new year time
 Astrobytes: many users with families and/or young children
 jacek: and they put family above CG?
 Astrobytes: Shocking, I know.
 jrke: but i am still here
 Astrobytes: hey
 jrke: but going to sleep now lol
 Astrobytes: and you put sleep above CG? :P
 jrke: i do not but my family won't allow that
 jrke: so gn bye
 Astrobytes: hehehe, gn jrke
 jacek: still sleeps later than euler
 Astrobytes: :D
 srkhatti: helo
 jacek: over 1m in 2048 \o/
 eulerscheZahl: congrats! just don't break the engine and sneak your way around it&#160;;)
 jacek: i would not do such thing eh
 Westicles: Is there anything random in the blockout testcases, or the same every time?
 eulerscheZahl: the color of the blocks is random
 Westicles: ha, okay
 jacek: 2.5m :tada: the difficulty is about tradeoff of move quality vs how many moves in 1 turn
 eulerscheZahl: i just changed some constants and improved from 10M to 40M :D
 eulerscheZahl: but if i go further in that direction, scores get lower again. i need a faster engine
 eulerscheZahl: beam width of 40 seems to be the lower bound for me
 jacek: but replays are so slow&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: read the statement carefully
 eulerscheZahl: If you add a - to the output, you will disable the viewer (as it can get laggy for longer games).
 jacek: who reads statements these days
 eulerscheZahl: i've spent some time writing it&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: and most players were like "2048, I know that game"
 Counterbalance: how do you apply a beam-width of 40 to a game that only has max 4 moves?
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: looking 60 turns ahead
 eulerscheZahl: not verbatim 2048. in the CG version the spawn algo is known so you can predict new tiles
 Counterbalance: so, iterative deepening keeping only the 40 best moves?
 Counterbalance: I ran into a ceiling / dead end problem.. doing brute force depth 7
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i prune to 40 nodes each time
 eulerscheZahl: and when i print, i don't print the whole path but remove the last 5 actions
 eulerscheZahl: that way i avoid dead ends that i don't detect as such at the end of my search
 Counterbalance: ah that's a good tip, thanks
 VizGhar: I have beam size of 200 and only picking first half of moves. Most of the time I'll hit 600 rounds limit
 VizGhar: I need size of 200 since I don't have ideal eval function&#160;:)
 jacek: n-tuples :kiss:
 Westicles: Forget the beam, go deterministic so you can get past big tiles with offline search
 VizGhar: I should try it then&#160;:) I only have snake eval (i^4*field)
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf">http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf</a>
 VizGhar: miss me with that shit, send algo
 VizGhar: :D
 VizGhar: Where is the time I could actually understand those formulas
 jacek: stupid math
 VizGhar: hmm jacek, you have those n-tupes implemented? I'm 10 places above you
 jacek: not in 2048, just started
 jacek: simple 5-6 depth brute force
 Westicles: 3 directions?
 Westicles: You don't need down until around 50M or so
 jacek: really?
 Westicles: yes
 jacek: meow
 Counterbalance: what's the biggest tile you guys have gotten so far?
 Westicles: 16/30 can only get 65k max, 14/30 can get 131k, 4/30 can get 131k_65k (in theory)
 Westicles: *131k+65k
 VizGhar: im using 64bit int for board representation = 4 bits per tile. My algo will die after reaching 64k tile :D
 struct: go 128bits
 <b>**Counterbalance still trying to beat random bot at chess</b></p><p><img src="/a/35448723594340" /> jacek: chess is so cheesy
 VizGhar: wow there is 128bit int in C++? didn't know that
 Counterbalance: writing a correct chess bot is more work than I thought..
 jacek: not portable
 jacek: but CG support it
 jacek: i still dont have castling or en passant
 VizGhar: jacek I'm looking at those n-tuples... you have to have precomputed weights or compute it during runtime somehow
 VizGhar: can't imagine how I can really use that approach
 jacek: you compute the weights offline and then use them online
 jacek: its like computing proper coefficients for any eval, like chess materials. 
 VizGhar: gotcha, but that 100k code limit is quite limiting
 jacek: is queen really worth 9 pawns, or more like 9.5 pawns etc.
 jacek: then get more creative
 jacek: probably we would be restricted to small n-tuples
 jacek: but still probably it would beat handcrafted evals
 struct: VizGhar there is int128, but is just two 64 bits together
 VizGhar: what is __int128&#160;?
 struct: a class with two int64
 struct: high and low
 jacek: Oo
 VizGhar: its brutal how my thinking is secretly gradually improving just by trying new algorithms... 3 hard puzzles in one day is quite an achievement
 jacek: thats what she said
 VizGhar: which part exactly? :D
 jacek: ... hard ...
 Edisonpro: Whats its the best language? to start
 jacek: python for simple things. java/c# for starters for something more serious
 VizGhar: any&#160;:) but pick python
 VizGhar: widely used and extremely easy
 Edisonpro: And how can I learn more faster... I mean like exercises
 jacek: try easy puzzles
 VizGhar: If you want to learn here go for Clash of Code
 VizGhar: and finish every clash even after limit is up. you will eventually get better
 Edisonpro: Thank you so much
 Edisonpro:&#160;:,3
 jacek: :o
 Edisonpro: How old were you when you started on this?
 VizGhar: CG or coding in general?
 Edisonpro: Coding in general&#160;:,3
 Edisonpro: Sorry Im not good in english I mean...
 Skynse: Is CodinGame suffering some kind of ddos or something?
 Kazz: i have issues too, testcase taking like 2mins&#160;:(
 Skynse: lol
 Skynse: same
 kobi-nesher: same
 Skynse: Took like 3 minutes to see my clash report
 Westicles: 1am in france, every day
 Skynse: must be some nightly maintenance
 Skynse: understandable
 Skuuur: is it a reccurent problem&#160;?
 Marin01: happened last night at exact same time 
 therealbeef: apparently it refreshes the rankings etc
 struct: Its buggy since they updated db
 RogerSkeie: Is there a keyboard shortcut to delete current line in the IDE?
 omar-kvasnicka: shift+del
 RogerSkeie: shift+del did nothing.
 BrainWart: Alt+F4
 RogerSkeie: That worked, thank you :wink:
 Thosquey: is agon_k here
 agon_k: ouai&#160;?
 BrainWart: it's hard to beat you python guys
 Skynse: my clash of code rank is almost in the 1000's 
 Skynse: man I wish I could keep grinding till I reached there but I have to sleep
 Skynse: top 1000's*
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: does clash of code get harder?
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: like the higher rank you have the harder puzzles I get?
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: and also does the rank drop if I stop playing like for a week?
 jacek: clashes are random
 jacek: and you drop rank slowly over time

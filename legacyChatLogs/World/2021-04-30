 Passifi: So I am working on battle towers right know, my idea was to iterate over every node and put and exit on the nodes which are connected to the most other nodes take that one out of the loop and mark the other nodes as connected then rinse and repeat this works until i hit the latter test cases. Now I wonder whether it is my implementation or whether my general idea is wrong. anyone got any Input&#160;?&#160;:)
 C2H5OH: IDE knows this method
 jacek: battle towers?
 jacek: tower dereference?
 Passifi: battle tower its a medium puzzle

 Passifi: to put it more simply what i tried to do is put an exit on the nodes which connect the most nodes and then fill up the dangline nodes at the end I thought this should work but maybe I am missing something
 PaarthThePro: I was banned from World chat for posting clash links

 LightDarkness: guys while playing AI mode, how to output random things for the sake of debugging without crashing the game? 
 LightDarkness: I'm using C++\
 Alex-1: hello guys
 Astrobytes: std::cerr
 Boutayeb: hey
 Astrobytes: LightDarkness: stderr, std::cerr
 Alex-1: Astro are you free in that time
 Astrobytes: No, I'm working
 Alex-1: ohh
 Boutayeb: app games c#
 Alex-1: Boutayeb what do you mean by app games C#
 Alex-1: Automaton2000 Banned
 Automaton2000: make sure to use the right tool for the job
 LightDarkness: @Astrobytes I'm having problem using it.. still making crash (when I remove it the line the code works) 
 Astrobytes: paste your code here I'll have a quick look
 LightDarkness: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e8b974d-9f98-4450-9977-6d98728c75dc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e8b974d-9f98-4450-9977-6d98728c75dc</a>
 LightDarkness: line 54
 LightDarkness: wait lemme comment it 
 Astrobytes: I think it's something to do with you accessing nodes[] rather than outputting to cerr
 DaNinja: line 48 should be cerr
 Astrobytes: good spot
 Astrobytes: yep
 Alex-1: DaNinja i don't see you from long time where you gone
 LightDarkness: yeah you're right about line 48, but still i can't see the output&#160;:/
 DaNinja: switched to front-end dev for a while, trying Svelte
 Alex-1: what a deal i try Fantastic bits and reach the wood1 i try to bronze or i am better than boss it saying but not promoting to bronze rank = 5
 Alex-1: :worried:
 LightDarkness: okkay didn't know cerr is gonna output as an error, my bad :sweat_smile: Thank you guys 
 LightDarkness: it's working now
 Alex-1: can any body help
 Alex-1: :point_up:
 CEE-JAY: hi
 Alex-1: CEE-JAY hi
 Astrobytes: Nice one LightDarkness
 jacek: Alex-1 you need to be above boss, as well the other people
 Alex-1: but i am trying it always defeat the boss but not going to up and down jacek
 jacek: resubmit to arena and wait
 Alex-1: trying to resubmit fall down
 Alex-1: :joy:
 jacek: oh my

 DeeAyDan: Good afternoon people. I'm trying to solve Don't Panic - Episode 1. On case 4 my clone blocks on the middle of the map, and I don't know why. Can somebody give me a clue?
 LightDarkness: even with endl, it's not showing any increasing 
 DaNinja: move "int counter = 1" before your while loop
 DaNinja: you keep resetting it to 1
 DeeAyDan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/af77db63-e7ae-47eb-8e31-a68332ee8e5d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/af77db63-e7ae-47eb-8e31-a68332ee8e5d</a>
 Alex-1: i got fall again
 Kitkat260: hi brother alex
 Astrobytes: re what DaNinja said about the counter variable, that looks like the reason your cerrs weren't printing the first time
 LightDarkness: @DaNinja, makes a lot of sense.. Enough with newbie stuff for now.. Than you so much :D 
 DaNinja: :D
 DaNinja: DeeAyDan try adding an else between your two output commands
 DaNinja: and use the elevator positions on each floor
 Alex-1: DaNinja is correct LightDarkness
 Passifi: is there any way to make the debug console not abbreviate the data&#160;? Im trying to import data to my idea for testing but in the middle of the stream there is a ... and a bunch of entries get skipped so thats no good ^^
 Passifi: *my IDE
 RoboStac: nope, thats a server side check, the only option is to output less
 Passifi: okay cool that was helpful. I just let the same code run twice and restrict the output accordingly now I have all the data&#160;:) thx
 Alex-1: jacek i am above the boss thanks for help

 Therabidpanther: oh no
 jacek: hes promoted
 Therabidpanther: a lot can happen in 1 hour and 5 minutes

 jacek: he cant interfere with lower life forms
 Moe07: yo this RGB to hex question when testing i got 100% but when i submitted i got 0%
 Moe07:&#160;??
 Astrobytes: Validators are different from the test cases to prevent hardcoding.
 Moe07: hmm i dont think i hardcoded 
 Moe07: i dont know wtv
 Therabidpanther: 100% to 0% is tragic tho lolo
 Moe07: would u like to look at my solution?
 Therabidpanther: honestly has to be hard coded for that?
 Astrobytes: Solve the general case not the tests
 Moe07: thats what i did
 Astrobytes: And watch out for edge cases
 Moe07: yeah im not sure i originally had the same code as someone who got 100% but when i ran my solution the tests failed so i had to change it up, after that i  got 100%, but when i sumbitted i got 0
 Therabidpanther: im close to a solution, but with all the little changes i made myself lost lol
 Therabidpanther: 100SHARE
 Astrobytes: gone
 Kitkat260: yea
 Astrobytes: Lord, he's gone. He's gone, gone, ain't nothin' gonna bring him back - he's gone
 Kitkat260: and i need him cause he is my brother
 Kitkat260: help me plz
 Astrobytes: Nothin' left to do but smile, smile, smile
 Kitkat260: can anyone replace him until he comes back
 Kitkat260: anyone
 Westicles: Little John maybe?
 Therabidpanther: im alex

 Passifi: woa just saw on coursera that russian universities give courses on competitive coding :upside_down:
 gamerboy15: how can i switch on test 2 if first one is correct
 gamerboy15: its just showing first one correct and when i go on line 2 it says test 1 incorrect
 Unkowncoder: help
 Unkowncoder: How do i complet this one
 KalamariKing: gamerboy15 wdym? Could you elaborate a bit?
 KalamariKing: Unknowncoder which? I won't tell you how, but I might be able to suggest something
 gamerboy15: umm\
 KalamariKing: If the code is succeeding one test but failing another, the code is wrong
 gamerboy15: when i was in clash of codes it gives me a challange like it saying excepted 5 got nothing i pruint 5 and then its like correct but at test two it says excepter 147 got 5 and when i change it to 147 it says test 1 incorrect
 gamerboy15: If the code is succeeding one test but failing another, the code is wrong 
 gamerboy15: right that bro
 gamerboy15: okay thank you
 KalamariKing: Sure
 jacek: dont hardcode the answer
 Digginwings: what does that mean
 gamerboy15: okay bro
 KalamariKing: Digginwings You have to calculate the result based on the inputs, you can't just print out the answer its expecting
 KalamariKing: If that makes sense
 Digginwings: ok yeah that does
 Digginwings: reverse mode is the hardest mode to me
 KalamariKing: Same
 gamerboy15: me too i'm doing reverse mode now and idk what to do here HHHAHAHA
 Digginwings: me too dont know what to do
 KalamariKing: Sometimes what you have to program is simple, other times the test cases make no sense
 gamerboy15: yeah bro
 gamerboy15: like
 gamerboy15: i need to do something
 gamerboy15: with this
 gamerboy15: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ce1b403d-9258-46ea-a726-f1ec158d520b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ce1b403d-9258-46ea-a726-f1ec158d520b</a>

 KalamariKing: I have no clue what to do with that but try converting it all into base10 nums
 KalamariKing: Then a pattern might be easier to see
 gamerboy15: yeah imma try ty for help
 TheBatMan_TM: yo
 TheBatMan_TM: can someone give me any project ideas?
 KalamariKing: A drone, but the flight instructions are sent through a neural-network-powered gesture recognition system
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 Passifi: or you could teach a furby to feel real emotions
 Passifi: beyond that it depends on your level Beginner&#160;? Tetris in a console&#160;! depending on the language you can go for real graphics too. best starting project  imo.
 TheBatMan_TM: I want some intermediate project ideas, maybe web based?
 KalamariKing: Something like replit will give you an online vbox, if you want one
 TheBatMan_TM: what's a vbox?
 Therabidpanther: like a virtual machine
 TheBatMan_TM: oh
 Therabidpanther: replit is amazing for web projects tho
 TheBatMan_TM: is working on an API a good idea?
 Therabidpanther: i mean, I love API development, never done it on replit tho
 TheBatMan_TM: ok thanks for the reply
 Therabidpanther: Most of my API development has been with Spring Boot, and I did see somebody did use Spring Boot on replit. so it is possible
 TheBatMan_TM: ok

 King_Coda: :expressionless:
 Astrobytes: I always wanted rats, but they totally wouldn't get on with my cats
 orangesnowfox: ... You say that
 orangesnowfox: But, is it the cats that would be scared?
 orangesnowfox: Because, we have rabbits... And one of them chased off a cat
 orangesnowfox: Like, a neighborhood cat, they stopped visiting because the rabbit was too scary
 King_Coda: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: No. The one in my pic bites sparrows now and then (usually I catch her). The other one used to chase a dog
 orangesnowfox: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Scientifically speaking cats and dogs are just as smart. But dogs are submissive, and cats are dominants.

 Astrobytes: *Raccoons
 King_Coda: it's so bizarre
 BlaiseEbuth: What's the purr pose of these things

 King_Coda: PeerPressureBytes convinced me to sign up for it
 King_Coda: somehow
 Astrobytes: Pressure, oh pressure, pressure gonna drop on you, Ah say, ah when drops, oh ya gonna feel it, know that were doin' wrong
 Quadchess: fuck off mate
 King_Coda: Oi
 King_Coda: Rude
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Bye Quadchess
 King_Coda: :rofl:
 jacek: he had such a nice name
 King_Coda: I read it as quaffles
 King_Coda: I think Quaffles sounds better
 Astrobytes: He's calling me mf in pm
 King_Coda: how rude
 Astrobytes: "Unban me mf"
 King_Coda: Not with that language
 thehairy: hello astro :wave:
 Hjax: lol why are people so terrible at just being nice
 King_Coda: Does he kiss his mother with that mouth?
 King_Coda: Astrobytes, apparently Quadchess thought you were spamming?
 Hjax: no fun allowed, all fun is spam!
 King_Coda: indeed
 Astrobytes: He can't read? PeerPressureBytes -&gt; Pressure Drop lyrics... not much of a stretch
 King_Coda: Apparently
 King_Coda: He doesn't seem the brightest of people
 Hjax: even if thats true, his response to getting banned would imply he deserves to stay banned
 King_Coda: indeed
 Hjax: if he had been like "oh im sorry i misunderstood, i thought you were spamming" maybe astro would be a bit more forgiving lol 
 struct: Just wait until they find there is no unban command
 jacek: :scream:
 King_Coda: :scream:
 King_Coda: LOL
 BlaiseEbuth: Who need unban
 VizGhar: if somebody gets banned for explicit language, they should never be unbanned&#160;:)
 jacek: bloody hell
 Hjax: *raises pitchfork*
 Spacefish: lol I suck at this
 Spacefish: Who would of thought stress takes skill away
 Smelty: ugh ill never reach top 1000 coc
 struct: just memorize every clash
 Smelty: yea, will only take up around 5 tetrabytes of data
 Smelty: not *too* bad /j

 struct: Here is multiple tips for ruby
 struct: Now you are ready
 King_Coda: lol
 Lachrymosa: I have been trying to get this DFS to return the deepest leaf for a week now :V  I keep getting nearer but I'm off by one depending on the case, or I end up with some crazy number like 96 when I needed 3.
 Lachrymosa: recursion breaks my poor little head
 BusyLeon: ew
 orangesnowfox: Larchymosa, what are you using the DFS for?
 Astrobytes: Dwarves I think
 Astrobytes: Or whatever it's called
 Astrobytes: The puzzle
 Astrobytes: iirc
 orangesnowfox: Presumably not COTR
 Lachrymosa: Yea dwarves
 orangesnowfox: (only reason it's in my head is because that's what *I'm* doing that rn)
 Astrobytes: (sorry I'm multitasking here to teh tune of about 8 things, down from 10 at least)
 Lachrymosa: The issue I'm running into that is keeping me from  completely ripping off a DFS example is they're all geared towards searching for a specific leaf and not traversing the whole tree and returning depths
 Lachrymosa: I think the way the node maps are set up are different in the examples too. In mine I use a dictionary that has keys to nodes that have children, if the node has no children It isn't in the dictionary as a key
 Lachrymosa: I think what makes recursion hard for me is I use only the CG IDE and don't have a step-through function. And if I use stderr prints they can come out of order to whats actually happening
 Lachrymosa: When I move here soon I'm planning on picking up a big whiteboard so I can rubber ducky and project plan better :V
 Astrobytes: Traverse the tree in a DFS manner and keep the depth at a leaf node if deeper than the last leaf node depth you recorded?
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure it was along those lines
 Lachrymosa: Maybe, but for now I don't think I'm properly counting depths because my recursion is too much of a black box for me rn.
 Lachrymosa: My node objects have two values, the key and a list of children. Maybe if i pop a child upon visiting it will fix it
 struct: Also you dont need to use recursion
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you can use an iterative version easily
 Astrobytes: I am helping someone to beat me in Clobber. Why am I helping someone to beat me in clobber.
 Astrobytes: They already beat me but still I help.
 Lachrymosa: I suppose I don't have to use recursion, but this is a relatively simple problem to use it with, and I'll need to figure it out eventually right?
 struct: you are right
 Astrobytes: The choice is yours
 Lachrymosa: I need to get this :V so I'll stick with it.  I remember when I first started on here it took me 2 months to figure out the descent lol
 Lachrymosa: I couldn't wrap my head around the input-&gt;print system 
 Astrobytes: You do what feels necessary Lachrymosa, I remember you from before and you've come a long way
 Astrobytes: You left Germany and went back to US right?
 Lachrymosa: Yea, I'm settled up in Texas now
 Lachrymosa: Pursuing cyber security with long-term goal in red-teaming/pentesting
 Astrobytes: Cool beans, all going well?
 Lachrymosa: Yea :D I'm getting SANS certs for free from my employer and standing up a new SIEM for our enterprise, its super cool, but also so much new info 0.o and it's never going to let up cause theres always something more to learn
 Lachrymosa: my current python skills are overkill for my job atm, but if I want to do the GXPN later I think I'll need deeper knowledge in C++ and stuff so I can manipulate memory for exploits better
 Astrobytes: Nice! Hey, in any discipline the learning never stops
 Astrobytes: Yeah I'd recommend getting down and dirty with learning the machine inside out. If you plan to go down that road it will serve you well.
 Lachrymosa: Yea, but like when I was fixing cars before the "new" info was hooking up diagnostics equipment to the ECM, or knowing a proprietary fastener cause German engineering or something.  This is just... like, I have to write signatures for alerts. But to know what I'm looking for I have to research what the signature would even be looking for and then do some heuristics to make sure I don't have a lot of false positives or worse false negatives
 Lachrymosa: all the things, hectic, but happy
 Astrobytes: Depends how deep you want to go. But actual knowledge of what vulnerabilities you exploit are a massive bonus :D
 Astrobytes: ^reply to previous message not last
 Lachrymosa: well I want to get that OSCP under my belt, and they don't allow metasploit modules that you didn't put in there yourself lol
 Astrobytes: That's what I like to hear
 Lachrymosa: Once this whole covid lockdown lets up a bit I'd love to go to defcon or shmoocon or something
 Lachrymosa: Its weird looking at my skills in review and then still having imposter syndrome XD
 Astrobytes: PostCovidList: out of bounds exception
 Lachrymosa: kek
 Astrobytes: Ey imposter syndrome is real. Just trust yourself. And you have nothing to lose, everything to gain.
 Zenoscave: One more week!
 Astrobytes: Failures are just the success you didn't achieve yet - that sounds corny af, but if you learn from your failures...
 Zenoscave: It sounds corny because it is corny Astrobytes. you're not wrong though
 Lachrymosa: Yea, its cliche but theres a reason for that. It is objectively true
 <b>**Astrobytes takes a bow</b></p><p><img src="/a/2035277628770" /> Lachrymosa: My goal with this next competition is to get high silver and maybe break into gold
 Zenoscave: Great we fed his ego
 Lachrymosa: previously it's been to get copper
 Astrobytes: It was starved Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: as it should be Astrobytes
 Zenoscave: -_-
 Zenoscave: Lachrymosa what lang will you use?
 Lachrymosa: Is Zenoscave like Plato's Cave but in order to see the shadow on the wall the light would have to reflect halfway to my eyes, and then the remaining half, etc so I'd never see anything?
 Lachrymosa: Python
 Zenoscave: FINALLY
 Zenoscave: That joke has gone unnoticed for 5 years
 Zenoscave: you just made my day
 Lachrymosa: &gt;.&gt; I follow existential comics so philosophy jokes are a fave
 Astrobytes: I *could* be wrong but I'm pretty sure that's been uncovered previously no?
 Zenoscave: It was uncovered but no one got it, I had to explain
 Astrobytes: existential comics?
 Astrobytes: Now that's something
 Lachrymosa: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://existentialcomics.com/comic/1">https://existentialcomics.com/comic/1</a>
 Lachrymosa: great comic, funny artist, their twitter is also a riot
 Astrobytes: Nope. I literally meant 'existential comics'
 Lachrymosa: oh lol, wouldn't that be all of them?
 Astrobytes: That's up for discussion
 Lachrymosa: Like isn't "Whats the deal with airline food?" a few somber thoughts away from why are we here?
 Astrobytes: Comic is also a noun for a comedian
 Lachrymosa: I got that, I'm insinuating that a comedian, being someone who draws humour from observations of everyday life, is inherently existential in that they question their very existence and find absurdity in it.  
 Astrobytes: True. Yet not all humour is observational yet may still be comical. And may draw on themes of existentialism.
 Smelty: perhapsn'tll
 Astrobytes: Hehe, sorry. I love absurd, surreal and non sequitur based humour. 
 Lachrymosa: Same :3
 Lachrymosa: even anti-humour is appreciated
 Zenoscave: I like the worst humor simply to watch people die
 Zenoscave: The dad joke
 Lachrymosa: Puns are the highest form of comedy and the weak shirk from the light of salvation that it brings.
 Astrobytes: I take issue only with crude humour where it is undue. Almost everything else is game.
 Lachrymosa: I maintain that comedy punches up, if you're punching down that is the oppressor speaking
 Astrobytes: Depends on the format - comedy battles
 Astrobytes: But yeah, speaking broadly, 100%
 Lachrymosa: Context is always relevant. Chapelle for instance says some objectively heinous stuff, but he usually does it as hyperbole to point out people who genuinely have the negative sentiment
 fvla: That's an interesting one I've never heard before: "comedy punches up."
 Lachrymosa: Theres also people like Anothony Jeselnik who crafts brilliant jokes with excellent gotcha punchlines. His humour is almost exclusively crude, though never quite aimed at one particular real person. I think the fact that he is consistently crude and doesn't use real people for subjects gets him through the public gauntlet.  Though New Zealand really hates him for his shark party bit
 fvla: I think it's just important to remember that one can't become a complete comedian without learning how to make fun of themself
 Lachrymosa: Yea, comedy punches up is like a rule among most comedians. It defines the social rules that allow us to make fun of Karens but not tell jokes that rely on racial stereotypes. A Karen is ideologically rooted in systemic and societal power and privilege, while racial stereotypes are tools to enforce that power balance in favor of "The Karen".  Sorry if I'm getting too deep into this :V
 Lachrymosa: You're absolutely right though, a healthy amount of self-deprecation is key
 therealbeef: May&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: 7 hours to go :3
 Lachrymosa: Hello from the past~
 therealbeef: you're not in Spangdahlem?
 Astrobytes: Lachrymosa: I'm going to sleep now but I have to say that the last few comments were excellent, especially with regards to self-deprecation
 Lachrymosa: Not anymore, I should update that
 Lachrymosa: Alrighty Astrobytes, was good chatting ^_^ I'll be seeing you around!
 Smelty: heeeellloo
 Zahkklm: hello fukers
 Zahkklm: how's it going
 therealbeef: it's going better than Turkey's economy
 Zahkklm: reasonable answer

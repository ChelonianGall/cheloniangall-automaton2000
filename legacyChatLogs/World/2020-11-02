 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Time to spam clashes to get my rank back up...
 Majeck: ...
 Majeck: It's 3 AM
 Majeck: On A school night
 Majeck: I can't decide whether I should continue or just go to sleep
 Majeck: I'm literally two lines away from completing Mars Lander 3
 Majeck: Hmmmm
 eulerscheZahl: i might be late but I would suggest Bandas for MCTS
 Majeck: MCTS?
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo tree search
 Majeck: Ah yes of course
 Majeck: And Bandas?

 aCat: but this was I suppose answer for Zenoscave question from before
 blazeswipe: I cant beat bronze league cuz im too lazy to write a good alg.
 Dadino: hi
 bool-maybe: hi
 JohnBrzenk: hi
 jribeast: hi
 Illedan: :tada: my testing of random values on C4L was enough for Legend :D 
 aCat: congratz&#160;;-)
 bi0phaz3: It's been years since I've been in this chat and I still see the same names&#160;:)
 DomiKo: there are some new ones&#160;;)
 bi0phaz3: Well of course, I just mean it's nice to see those who were on when I was still in junior high school still on now
 bi0phaz3: Now I'm in my 2nd year of uni haha
 TheoreticalSamourai_9169: can i have the solution of shadows of the knight episode 1 plz
 Astrobytes: No you may not.
 Illedan: Better to ask what you are stuck at
 Astrobytes: and check the relevant forum thread
 AntiSquid: someone help me!
 JD12: ya
 AntiSquid: i need to load a van
 JD12: ummmmmmm
 Realsakib25: What is masters theorem in algorithm
 Ariyuuki: ada orang indonesia?
 Jdools05: hey, I have a quick question on how to use slackbot for CoC, I would like to play private matches with my friends. Thanks in advance!
 _Programmer_: message/clash
 eulerscheZahl: nice, another multiplayer as the puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: yeah, pretty awesome
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i still try to understand the selection algo. 4.4 stars and only 8 votes isn't that impressive. The Go puzzle from last week had a much better rating
 eulerscheZahl: not complaining about penguins being chosen, just confused by how it works
 Astrobytes: yeah, and strange how we've had so many multiplayers as potw recently
 Astrobytes: Perhaps it's been changed recently
 eulerscheZahl: we had so many new multiplayers recently :P
 Astrobytes: Hm, yeah, fair point lol
 darkhorse64: Multis are CG strong points. No wonder they want to highlight them.
 Realsakib25: what is optimal merge pattern
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm convinced the selection isn't done my a human. and probably in place without any changes for a long time
 eulerscheZahl: so i would expect it to be some function of rating, vote counts, maybe age
 eulerscheZahl: and one that hasn't been promoted before
 darkhorse64: Ask our favorite CM
 eulerscheZahl: asking irrelevant questions and pinging staff members always was MadKnight's job
 darkhorse64: Next step: promote a community multi with real leagues once a year
 eulerscheZahl: let's do the math...
 darkhorse64: I mean, a contribution
 eulerscheZahl: first community multi: Vindinium in February 2019
 eulerscheZahl: new we are at 24 community multiplayer games
 eulerscheZahl: 22 if we count coders of the realm 
 eulerscheZahl: so that would mean that less than 10% of the games deserve a league system?
 Realsakib25: What is Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm 
 eulerscheZahl: a word that you paste into google
 eulerscheZahl: FFT = fast fourier transformation
 eulerscheZahl: for the rest i would have to investigate too
 darkhorse64: One per year is maybe too restrictive but not too overly ambituous
 darkhorse64: ambitious
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still waiting for leagues at PR2 and BTTC
 Astrobytes: would be nice but seems like wishful thinking unfortunately
 eulerscheZahl: i'm happy that we can upload our own games. was a huge feature to allow that
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse64 is too young to really remember the time before&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :D
 darkhorse64: I don't know what is involved in having real leagues but this is really where CG expectations is a mystery to me
 darkhorse64: Completing my second year here
 player_one: Hey CGs... Haven't been on in a while (years) and I just started getting back into it last week.
 eulerscheZahl: at some point there were no leagues at all. one big fat blob in each contest
 player_one: I'm playing around with Bulls and Cows 2.
 eulerscheZahl: oh, hi player_one. haven't seen you in ages
 Astrobytes: A wild player_one appears!
 player_one: I'm pretty sure that the validators are random, as in... They're different every time I submit.
 eulerscheZahl: and thibaud stole your mod circle&#160;:(
 player_one: Thoughts?
 eulerscheZahl: validators are random
 eulerscheZahl: they have some constraints
 eulerscheZahl: the 1 digit case always gives you a score of 5
 eulerscheZahl: and others have a fixed number of bulls and cows returned after your first guess
 player_one: Yeah.  I shouldn't be a mod anymore, euler
 player_one: Doesn't make sense.
 player_one: Okay. Just checking on that.
 eulerscheZahl: you could try some statistical analysis if you should put a 0 in your initial guess or not. I didn't go that far
 player_one: That implementation really encourages re-submit until you get a better placement, and it's also hard to determine if your algorithm actually improves. :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: as the 0 can't be at the first place. so that might reduce the number of candidates with the first guess.
 player_one: But OTOH, it's possible to figure out the validator numbers if they're not random, so I guess that's the only way.
 eulerscheZahl: how would that reward spam submitting? :thinking:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vbzxln">https://prnt.sc/vbzxln</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, known validators would make the whole thing pointless
 eulerscheZahl: so, back to the CG history lesson...
 eulerscheZahl: in the past there were no leagues at all. and contests just ended. no final rerun
 eulerscheZahl: smash the code was the first with a league system
 eulerscheZahl: and later some older games got leagues added
 eulerscheZahl: initially CG said they would add them to all their games. 2 are still missing
 eulerscheZahl: the final recalc in a contest was added even after STC. must have been CSB or codebusters. still before my active time
 dbdr: the meta on resubs near the end must have been crazy!
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Dbdr broke it 
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: :p
 eulerscheZahl: broke what? my wall of text?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Mhm
 eulerscheZahl: i'll kick him for interrupting me
 dbdr: kick duel :D
 eulerscheZahl: who's faster?
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i have chat history to lose
 dbdr: and meaner
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: What if I just report you both?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: For abusing mod privileges :p
 eulerscheZahl: we would kick you as a revenge
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ...
 eulerscheZahl: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: .
 dbdr: anything super valuable in the chat history right now?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still a little kid inside
 eulerscheZahl: no, just casual talk
 eulerscheZahl: about penguins as the new puzzle of the week
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I'm struggling with a super vague problem statement
 eulerscheZahl: share it
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef5f3689-3c5f-4495-b86d-3622d16cf0f6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef5f3689-3c5f-4495-b86d-3622d16cf0f6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so you are given 2 binary numbers
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: yep
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Idk what to do with them
 eulerscheZahl: and shall print the bitwise OR operation result
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: if one if the numbers as a '1' at a given index, the result has so too

 IceCodeZero: I feel like I completely forgot everything python related
 Karem_Khan: wowowowowo
 AntiSquid: how's life&#160;?
 azh412: .
 Majeck: At what level is chat unlocked?
 LastRick: hah
 IceCodeZero: 3 i think
 Majeck: Thanks
 LastRick: wait, I was laughing, is it really locked for new users below 3? I guess i didn't notice early on.
 Majeck: Yeah
 Majeck: First few levels the chat is locked
 Majeck: (For good reason)
 Majeck: I still remember round about two years ago, the moment I gained access to the chat I felt like a king lol
 LastRick: hah hah
 eulerscheZahl: i remember the time when everyone could use the chat
 Majeck: Oof, how many years ago was that?
 eulerscheZahl: i think that constraint is a good thing to require some basic knowledge at least
 player_one: You mean the time when no one could use chat?&#160;:-P
 eulerscheZahl: hm, maybe 2. not sure
 eulerscheZahl: the time without a chat at all is too far back for me to know :D
 eulerscheZahl: also the time with puzzle contests and no multiplayers
 player_one: Well there's that too, but I mean before the restriction was in place, there was so much spam, it was completely unusable.
 eulerscheZahl: but i've been here when you had to solve easy puzzles first to unlock the harder ones
 LastRick: that's an interesting idea
 eulerscheZahl: and community puzzles had their own section. not scrambled in easy, medium, ...
 LastRick: Is there a way I can look at a puzzle and know if it is an original or a community donated one?
 eulerscheZahl: by XXX =&gt; community
 player_one: In the puzzle tile screen, if it doesn't have an avatar, then it's not community.
 eulerscheZahl: and initially only very few users could moderate the pending contributions. player one being one of them
 LastRick: I can't complain about the community puzzles then -- without them, there'd be so few puzzles. I mean, mediums must be 80% community driven at least/
 eulerscheZahl: later it was dependent of your user level.and i was happy when i finally reached lvl20 and got the moderation rights too
 jacek: w000 new puzzle of the week

 Markic: I'm new to codingame so can I view the task after submitting a solution?
 Majeck: Depends
 Majeck: Not for Clash of Code
 jacek: clash?
 Majeck: Yes for normal puzzles
 Majeck: Just click "Solve" in the puzzle page and then -&gt; Results on the left of the IDE
 Markic: so no for clash?
 Majeck: No for clash
 Markic: ok thanks
 Majeck: Unless you remember specific keywords
 Majeck: And are willing to look for them in this site: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Markic: what about the one where there is no text and you need to solve it looking at given inputs outputs?
 Markic: hopeless to find those?
 Majeck: Absolutely hopeless
 Majeck: Your only hope to knowing wtf you were supposed to do is:
 Majeck: A) Look at the solutions of the other people who played the clash with you
 Majeck: B) In the clash channel ask what was the task to be solved
 Majeck: B )
 Markic: those chats are always empty so I don't even know what they're for
 jacek: :o
 Markic: Only the people of that clash are in the channel, right?
 Majeck: Yes
 Majeck: You can write in them
 Majeck: And they're there precisely so that you can ask what the solution was
 Majeck: Or make friends
 jacek: clash pals
 eulerscheZahl: or you remember the author of the clash
 LastRick: you can also use those chats to complain about the clash to fellow clashers
 eulerscheZahl: but the bots won't reply
 LastRick: Random thought: if I'm on the home page, why is it so non-obvious how to get to the message board?
 LastRick: Random thought 2: On the "Learn" tab, can we get a checkbox for Dart? I wish that tab was different. Like maybe arranged by topics so it was more intuitive "how" to use the page to learn.

 darkhorse64: Yeah, an incredible cheating performance
 LastRick: wow
 jacek: what if he made bot making bots

 Zenoscave: automaton2000 Get euler
 Automaton2000: im not sure what to do about it
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000 just get him, duh
 Automaton2000: i must be missing something
 LastRick: yeah, you're missing euler
 Zenoscave: ^ LastRick gets it
 LastRick: what good are bots if they cant rouse Euler from sleeping?
 Zenoscave: they're no good to me dead
 LastRick: Spring 2021 Contest idea: Code a realistic Euler AI. Able to send me validators and code snippets and tell old grandpa stories about CG back in 2018.
 Majeck: "Back in my day we only had official puzzles! And we liked it"
 Majeck: "We had no riff raffing Vim editors and the whaddaya call them"
 Majeck: "the EmAcs"
 Majeck: I no-joke had a dream where the CG editor let me use multiple files last night
 Majeck: I woke up and thought it was an actual feature lol
 Majeck: Someday I guess
 LastRick: Thats why they call it a dream
 Majeck: Right now I have a 1700 line project
 Majeck: It's really clean code
 Majeck: And it gets me through the two Mars Lander - Episode 3 tests
 LastRick: Sheesh. Which puzzle? 
 LastRick: ah
 Majeck: I'm worried it won't pass the validators though
 Majeck: I'm too scared too submit
 Majeck: Cause they arrive with barely any fuel too the landing site
 KiwiTae: failure is good just go for it
 LastRick: Validators are the worst. 
 Majeck: It's just I've put on a lot of importance on me passing this puzzle (I've planned for it to be the one that gets me to level 20)
 Majeck: I don't want to pass with like 33% hahaha
 Majeck: So I'll keep working on it, in the 1700 hundred line program :weary:
 Majeck: At least there's no bugs
 Majeck: That's cool
 Majeck: And really unexpected
 KiwiTae: i passed lvl32 2 nights ago
 KiwiTae: it was hardwork too
 KiwiTae:&#160;:(
 Majeck: What's the longest program you've written for CG KiwiTae?
 KiwiTae: someone pushed me silver in a multi i barely touched 2years ago lol
 Majeck: And you LastRick?
 Majeck: KiwiTae that's awesome lol
 LastRick: Longest? Hmm, I'll have to look. I've done zero contests (just joined this fall) and haven't touched much past medium. so I'm guessing nothing too long.
 KiwiTae: Majeck no clue maybe it was for botters of the galaxi lol
 KiwiTae: or meanmax 
 Majeck: I have a serious problem with long programs
 Majeck: I always write like the triple amount of lines than every other solution hahaha
 KiwiTae: lol
 LastRick: its definitely a challenge on here when it all has to be one file. I find it definitely helps that you can collapse functions. So I tend to write everything in functions as much as possible
 Majeck: For example I was seeing the Cat &amp; Mouse game and to solve it, I did like 300 lines more than everybody else lol
 KiwiTae: Majeck I just updated the camera actor in my game yesterday that file in 2000 lines already lol
 Majeck: LastRick I usually don't like collapsing functions and classes (harder to locate bugs), but yeah it's kind of a necessity for long programs
 Majeck: KiwiTae for what game?
 Majeck: It's also a shame that the IDE doesn't remember what you've collapsed :P
 Majeck: Woaaaaahhhhhhhh
 Majeck: My algorithmic-solution is 50 units of fuel more efficient than my brute force one
 Majeck: That's awesome! the program can solve the problem better than I can
 LastRick: Majeck thanks for the follow
 Majeck: No problem, it took me off guard that I wasn't already following you lol
 LastRick: Same!
 SandmanSW96: Hey, quick question, I know it's not related to CG or coding, but does anyone here use Steam?
 Majeck: Sure
 SandmanSW96: trying to download a free to play game and can not for the life of me find the download button/link/etc
 Majeck: Do you use Mac?
 SandmanSW96: put it on the 'wish list' *shrugs*
 SandmanSW96: nah win 10
 Majeck: Two possibilities (three)
 Majeck: A) You didn't find the button (unlikely)
 Majeck: B) It's not available in your device/OS (probable)
 Majeck: B )
 Majeck: C) The game's not available for release yet/in your location (probable)
 SandmanSW96: it's been out for years, and when I first googled the game for PC I am well within the requirements, even Vista was listed.  and I have hunted every screen in there.  Apparantly I'm not the only one with this problem lol
 SandmanSW96: the developer's website has a download button, give you one guess where it sent me XD
 Majeck: Steam?
 SandmanSW96: yeah
 SandmanSW96: all roads lead to steam's page for the game itself, and it has no download button at all
 Majeck: What's the game?
 SandmanSW96: Heroes Evolved
 SandmanSW96: found it on a 3rd party site
 SandmanSW96: man what a pain in the sack loll
 SandmanSW96: nvm that one was shady
 Majeck: Are you saying the internet can be untrustworthy?
 Majeck: Blasphemy

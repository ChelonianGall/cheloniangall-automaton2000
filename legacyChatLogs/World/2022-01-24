 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: :frowning2:
 MrZee: Question, if I have to close the page in the middle of a puzzle, does my code I wrote so far autosave?
 5DN1L: You have to play your code once in order for it to be saved
 MrZee: Thank you!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: How can I improve my coding skills&#160;:(
 21stCenturyPeon: same as any other skill. practice, practice, practice, learn new bits, repeat until awesome
 dreadylein: get a good book /tutorial series for your language of choice, find a project you are passionated for, then code 
 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: Thank you :D
 dreadylein: your welcome
 derjack: improve? so you already have some coding basics?
 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: maybe
 sparkym: yoooo
 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: hello
 derjack: if you have some basics, try power of thor, the descent, temperatures puzzles
 CryanRyan: Benis
 Vicas7: HEYYYYY yoO
 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: Hello
 CryanRyan: How to code?
 Vicas7: with your keyboard
 Vicas7: xD
 CryanRyan: I do not have a keyboard
 CryanRyan: using speech to text
 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: ._.
 Vicas7: .-.
 Katespizer: its even better that way

 ninjadip: what a beautiful coding morning
 Dragon15609: is anyone able to help, I've converted a text file into a string[] using readall lines and now i'm not sure how to add to it
 Dragon15609: i've looked it up but i haven't been able to find a concrete solution
 ninjadip: search google how to write to file in that language
 ninjadip: how to write text
 ninjadip: usually you have to open the file as such, to have read/write since you are writing too. but idk what language you're talking about
 Dragon15609: C#, that's what ive done. ive taken the file and then called upon it and used ReadAllLines to make it a string array so that i can then resave it after adding to it
 Dragon15609: i just don't know how to add to it
 ninjadip: so appending the file
 ninjadip: maybe google how to append text file c#
 Dragon15609: thanks, im a student and i haven't been taught what appending is, thanks you've just opened up a whole new world of google searches for me
 ninjadip: i thought it might
 ninjadip: having the right keyword helps
 Dragon15609: ha
 ninjadip: i haven't messed with c# before. i heard it's like java?
 21stCenturyPeon: Very. If you understand one, you'll be able to pick up the other.
 derjack: except the methods start with capital letters
 struct: what happened to bt leaderboard?
 struct: everyone has the same points
 struct: or close to the same
 Wontonimo: i don't see a problem now
 nesnes112: Cederkaeppen please ur code in clash
 Euler_Phi_Function: hi wontonimo 
 Euler_Phi_Function: euler phi function
 Wontonimo: hey, how's your day going Euler_Phi_Function&#160;?
 Epsilon_Delta_Notation: great
 Wontonimo: excellent smithers 
 derjack: struct where? there are 48 48 44 42 38...
 derjack: nothing can break breakthrough leaderboard
 FrancoRoura: Hey does things like opening MDN docs in a new tab count as cheating for certifications?
 struct: i would say no
 Frankich: I personnaly don't expect any developer to work without docs, so I would say no as well
 derjack: and 2 ppl subimiting to bt now oO
 struct: They probably are battling each other
 darkhorse64: Truly excellent contribution :blush:
 derjack: but no leagues :unamused:
 struct: we need a boss there
 derjack: shall I provide one
 darkhorse64: Recurs e&#160;?
 struct: What rank should boss be?
 struct: top 30?
 darkhorse64: I should revise the contrib to remove this silly pawn animation
 derjack: that would be even worse than othello
 struct: you only need to change 1 line
 derjack: silly pawn animation?
 struct: when its captured I think
 darkhorse64: yep
 derjack: so checkersy
 struct: There is a parameter you can put on move()
 struct: or w/e its called on sdk
 darkhorse64: I stole the code from checkers
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codingame.github.io/codingame-game-engine/com/codingame/gameengine/module/entities/Curve.html">https://codingame.github.io/codingame-game-engine/com/codingame/gameengine/module/entities/Curve.html</a>
 struct: Its one of these
 struct: IMMEDIATE will move pawn instantly at 0.0
 struct: with no animation
 struct: NONE will move at 1.0
 struct: also with no animation
 darkhorse64: There is this new "featured event" with leagues. Let's wait for it to provide new bosses. 
 darkhorse64: For the animation, I would only make the pawn dissapear. No need to throw it across the board
 struct: yeah but with these ones it will achieve that
 struct: and you dont ahve to change much
 struct: only 1 line I think
 darkhorse64: True but I am also not happy with the rest of the code base
 struct: maybe you can also add highlighted cells
 struct: like on chess 960
 derjack: why any change anyway
 struct: we need 3d breakthrough
 darkhorse64: Anyway, I am the only one complaining. Yep, highlighted squares would be neat, reusing my last contrib. 3D&#160;? Nah. It's overengineering
 darkhorse64: My CTTT bot works&#160;! Featuring 128 bit bitboards&#160;! 
 Zenoscave: what's cttt? is it like uttt?
 struct: nice
 Zenoscave: pew pew btw
 struct: counting tic tac toe
 derjack: what for? its solved
 darkhorse64: Trying to win seems an OK strategy
 darkhorse64: I wrote the bot mostly to experiment with gcc __int128
 IrakliButu: is this binary???
 IrakliButu: o nvm
 struct: on breakthrough yeah
 Wontonimo: woot, my latest contrib got accepted "Markov text generation"
 Wontonimo: that's it for me for contributions for a while
 Wontonimo: have you decided on a wood2 bot yet for Breakthrough&#160;?
 jacek: would Automaton2000 solve that puzzle?
 Automaton2000: and you also have a lot of things that are not in the test folder
 darkhorse64: Automaton2000, do you think Wonto test coverage is not good&#160;?
 Automaton2000: can i be a mod
 Wontonimo: I see that BJD ranked 38th with javascript.  It would be nice if the Wood2 bot was below some of the non C languages
 darkhorse64: rise of the machines
 Wontonimo: lol
 struct: Non NN bots should not be allowed on the next league
 jacek: i would use somthing from about the half 
 Wontonimo:&#160;? wdym struct
 struct: only top 5, which are all NNs should be on the next league
 struct: mabe 6th is NN too? idk
 Wontonimo: that seems excessive
 jacek: so exclusive
 darkhorse64: elite league
 Wontonimo: so, you are volunteering your bot as the boss struct?
 struct: hmm my bot is not strong enough
 Wontonimo: it will allow the top 6 into wood1 and keep almost everyone else out
 jacek: and no fun in the wood1 league, almost no battles
 Wontonimo: I vote for top 30
 struct: Ill wait until I find a working eval
 struct: to decide
 Wontonimo: there are 232 bots in BT, so a top 30/50 and then divide the rest in half to make 3 leagues would be nice
 Wontonimo: i really like the first boss being a just-slightly-better-than-random
 Wontonimo: gives people a sense of progression right away
 Wontonimo: in this case, that would be wood3
 struct: yeah its hard to choose on community games
 Wontonimo: just clearing out the barely working bots from the rest would be a win
 Lambert_W_Function: hi mod
 Wontonimo: how about all the other people?  :rolling_eyes:

 Kitis: NOOOOO not the 2 types of eval
 Kitis: What is eval?
 Wontonimo: in python?  it runs code
 Kitis: oooooo I love python
 struct: Kitis evaluating the current state of the game
 Wontonimo: my earlier python code example was a joke by the way.  
 Kitis: But I can't figure out how to inport pyautogui
 Kitis:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: lol.  it's a joke.  it won't run
 Kitis: Ik
 Kitis: sadness
 Kitis: why do us coders always use "i" in loops?
 Wontonimo: because we are egocentric&#160;?
 Kitis: thets a funny word

 jacek: :scream:
 Kitis: i see.
 Wontonimo: always math
 Kitis: well in thet case
 Kitis: ......

 Kitis: It was a 1 YEAR ban
 Kitis: but i have rose from the dead
 Kitis: I still remember the mod
 Kitis: His name was Uljahn
 MSmits: if they said you were annoying with one  'n', I say they should lose their mod status for crimes against spelling
 Kitis: Im just 12
 Kitis:&#160;;(
 MSmits: yeah it;s fine when you do it
 MSmits: dont worry
 Wontonimo: hey, Kitis, take a break.  please keep your conversation related to the topic at had&#160;: breakthrough
 Kitis: Thenks for your fougivness
 Oniibaru: how am i supposed to these if i dont know any of the deffinitions -.-
 Kitis: whats that

 jacek: its hard to find bt papers. all i could find was something about breakthrough in cancer&#160;:( i dont care about that
 Kitis: you don't care about wontonimo. HE HAS CANCER look at his pfp
 MSmits: ehh careful there Kitis or you'll be gone again

 Wontonimo: ah.  yeah, that puzzle
 struct: so it seems i need to evaluate patterns?
 Wontonimo: you can't actually allocate all that memory.
 Wontonimo: you need to be "clever" about it
 jacek: n-tuples?
 struct: maybe I should learn it
 Kitis: any tips on python guys?
 Kitis: like what do YOU run it on&gt;
 Kitis:&#160;?
 jacek: computer
 Wontonimo: think about it Be-Ugeen.  If you have 500 1s followed by 500 2s, and you multiply that by 1000 3s, it becomes 500 1*3 and 500 2*3
 Kitis: can I be a mod
 Kitis: I will be nice
 Wontonimo: sure
 Kitis: YAY
 Kitis: u da best
 Wontonimo: but not here
 Kitis: awww
 Kitis: y not
 Kitis: i will be mice tho
 Kitis: nice*
 Oniibaru: why does the descent tell me to use stdin, stdout, and stderr as the first hint when these aren't defined things?
 Scarfield: y not mice
 Kitis: yes mine too
 Kitis: mice*
 Kitis: ahhhhh
 jacek: Oniibaru what language
 Kitis: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c2f1bb6-0b77-4bed-99d6-f2f70bbe8802">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c2f1bb6-0b77-4bed-99d6-f2f70bbe8802</a>
 Oniibaru: javascript
 jacek: most of them would be 'defined' by default in most language
 Kitis: in python is ther supposed to be a semicolen?
 jacek: in js, console.error prints to stderr
 jacek: generally the puzzles on codingame are structured that you get input in stding and you need to print answer in stdout, or console.log them
 Scarfield: no semicolon in python, but colons in loops, ifs etc.
 Scarfield: for i in range(10):
 Kitis: whats blabla
 Kitis: is it a fish?
 Scarfield: what ever you want it to be, 10 times
 Kitis: WOW
 Kitis: So i can have 10 fishes
 aertify: Why I cant see my debug messages?
 Kitis: is it safe to eat fishy food
 Kitis: because there are no debug messages
 Scarfield: what language, and how are you printing them aertify?
 aertify: C#, I've followed this message "To debug: Console.Error.WriteLine("Message");
 Kitis: sould i stop eating my fishy food? I fell sick
 Kitis: I print my stuff with my pronter
 Scarfield: should be correct, are you not writing anything else than debug? and maybe your code is timing out because of it
 Kitis: but I have no red ink but I can't print my black and white code
 Wontonimo: take another break Kitis and consider your life choices
 Sha_winter: hi
 aertify: Yeah, I've put some if statements, that might be the reason, sec I'll try to use debug without any other code I've added.
 Sha_winter: I was once deleted
 Sha_winter: And them
 Sha_winter: I was here
 Sha_winter: It smells like tofu

 Kitis: oh srry
 Kitis: sir wontonimo your wish is my command
 jacek: apparently more people are hyped for bt now
 Wontonimo: specifically asking to be banned and then acting poorly will get you banned
 Kitis: oh

 struct: maybe it was strong before
 jacek: bur last game is 2018:?
 struct: yeah
 struct: It was the bot mentioned on the paper
 struct: I sent
 struct: its probably down
 OleMurpho: What's littlegolem all about? Are there different game modes?
 jacek: its correspondence games only
 jacek: generaly 1 day for move
 struct: 1 move per day?
 jacek: day is the limit. coult be less
 struct: ah
 jacek: i use around 10 seconds
 jacek: mostly because my vps has only 1GB ram
 struct: do you do the move manually?
 jacek: no, its bot. parses html automatically
 struct: maybe if my bot thinks for 1 hour it can match your
 KalamariKing: havent been here in a while :cry:

 KalamariKing: hey Wontonimo long time no see
 KalamariKing: finals :sob:
 jacek: finals?
 5DN1L: trials
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, take some quizzes and tests and exams and finals
 Automaton2000: can i paste my code
 5DN1L: no
 Blokops: Automaton2000 what are your thoughts on the activition/Microsoft acquisition 
 Automaton2000: there is also a good idea
 Blokops: dang Automaton2000 is pro monopolies 
 Automaton2000: or i guess i need to know what you mean
 Blokops: i mean that Microsoft bought blizzard/activison Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yes i know, but it is worth it
 Blokops: Automaton200*0 being kind of sentient 
 Kitis: how do I open .py files they just instantly close
 Fasader: with an editor
 Fasader: right click-&gt;edit
 Fasader: notepad-&gt;open.. 
 Fasader: or get some IDE like pycharm, it's got a free community edition
 Fasader: double clicking .py files runs the code unless set up otherwise

 Blokops: 20s' since i knew the answer
 Blokops: made 3 guys quit
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: hey Blokops, good call on the difficulty of Markov Text being easy.  25 people have already attempted it with a 70% success rate
 Blokops: maybe you can do a part 2 with more complexity
 Wontonimo: yeah, i've been thinking of a NN variant 
 Wontonimo: but can't think of a clean way of doing it for codingame in a puzzle
 Blokops: wouldn't a NN need like a lot of data to work
 Blokops: and then the checking of result would be hard
 Wontonimo: exactly
 Blokops: oh maybe you could do a "image" object using euclidian distance
 Blokops: image object detection*
 Blokops: give n images and 1 image to compare
 Wontonimo: well then it wouldn't be text anymore :D
 Blokops: it can be black and white with range 0 to 255
 Blokops: sort of like the mnset
 Blokops: MNIST*
 Wontonimo: yeah, i know mnist
 Wontonimo: i was thinking more like word2vec or glove
 Wontonimo: with NLP instead of image processing

 Blokops: that and computer achiteecutre
 Wontonimo: like making furniture out of ipads&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yeah, that would be hard
 Wontonimo: okay, should have said bridges instead of furniture ... anyway ... always thought architecture was a funny term for good design in s/w
 Wontonimo: so what were you thinking for the clash of code&#160;?
 Blokops: a simple version of mnist
 Blokops: only 0 and 1
 Blokops: n imagem by m
 Blokops: plus one to compare 
 Blokops: return the index of the one that looks the most
 Blokops: also the compare one is flip numbers 
 Wontonimo: just direct, or do you have to include shifts, minor rotates, noise?
 Blokops: direct
 Wontonimo: so, if a 1 is just a few pixels to the left it would totally not match and that's okay right?
 Blokops: it shoudl be the one that matches the most
 Blokops: yea you are right it should have some noise/shift
 Wontonimo: if you have an image, say 30x30 pixels, then a poor-mans convolution is to sample 4 29x29 pixels from the original and use the result that has the strongest match
 Wontonimo: or 9 28x28
 Wontonimo: so you could provide some 28x28 samples, and one 30x30 
 Blokops: im am not doing 28x28 nope nope nope
 Wontonimo: that would address shifts
 Blokops: doing a contribution is a PAIN
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: it is
 Wontonimo: i'm taking a break for a while from contribs
 Blokops: still trying to grind that achivemnet
 Blokops: i dont know whats the last quest but i want those 500XP points
 Wontonimo: heh
 Blokops: i still dread doing the "very hard" puzzles one
 Blokops: took me 2 weeks to do the batman one
 Blokops: still need to do 1 more
 Wontonimo: create your first contribution and get 5 upvotes
 Wontonimo: that is for gold level
 Blokops: but the next one?
 Wontonimo: for legend level you need to get it approved
 Wontonimo: that's it
 Wontonimo: nothing after that
 Blokops: i might get legend on bot making before i can get that one
 Blokops: is like the clash of code last one 
 Wontonimo: which bot battle are you working on to get legend?
 Blokops: took me AGES

 NeoJex: so happy to finally do 50 code clashes
 White_Code: I just did 100
 White_Code: I am clash of code addict now
 ZXC01: lol
 TeslaRam: hican i reset my Mad Pod Racing progress?
 ZXC01: no
 ZXC01: use anothere acccount
 TeslaRam: thank you
 Thorcode: mad pod race is so hard
 Thorcode: for reaching legend XD
 resty-daze: most game are hard to enter legend
 Thorcode: do you know how mpr caculat the next checkpointangle
 resty-daze: does it have that parameter?
 Uljahn: most probably with atan2
 DialFrost:&#160;:)
 DialFrost: nope
 DialFrost: u can ig but idk how if u use atan2
 DialFrost: im using something else
 Automaton2000.: you mean numpy?
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, why would somebody want to name himself/herself after you?
 Automaton2000: do they give you an idea of what you were saying
 Automaton2000.:&#160;?
 Automaton2000.: yeah
 Automaton2000.: can someone help me with mad pod race?
 5DN1L: Ask Automaton2000 to help you
 Automaton2000: i see where i end up
 Automaton2000.: how to ask him?
 5DN1L: Just mention his name and ask
 Automaton2000.: thanks buddy, what is the badge next to your name
 jacek: my oh
 5DN1L: it's a mod badge
 Automaton2000.: nice
 Uljahn: just hover mouse pointer over it, also works with avatars
 Automaton2000.: thanks, can someone tell me how the mad pod race could caculate the next checkpoint dist?
 Automaton2000.: some input in mad pod race seem awesome
 Automaton2000.: this site seem awsome
 VirtutisBlack: Does this site work with firefox?
 5DN1L: yes
 willdrinkyourblood: can confirm
 VirtutisBlack: Hmm, in /learn/loops, I have nothing showing after STATEMENT 
 5DN1L: try refreshing?
 VirtutisBlack: Yea, did a cache clear too
 5DN1L: Could we see any screenshot?
 VirtutisBlack: sure, where do I post pic
 5DN1L: Please post the link to the pic
 VirtutisBlack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/DLRFghF.png">https://i.imgur.com/DLRFghF.png</a>
 5DN1L: yeah, no statement should be there lol
 5DN1L: statements are for individual puzzles or games
 5DN1L: choose the puzzles below
 VirtutisBlack: Yep, that works
 5DN1L: good&#160;:)
 MichaelDu26: hello every one
 tsagaanaa: hello
 Jerrasterix: "the pod's facing vector" what does this mean in CSB&#160;??
 qpi: what does CSB stand for&#160;?
 Uljahn: CSB == MPR
 qpi: :sweat_smile:

 Klaus_404: guys what is compiler mean&#160;?&#160;:)
 qpi: ok thx
 jacek: Automaton2000 what is compiler
 Automaton2000: i thought about it and i am pretty sure

 Jerrasterix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/x7fEZqg">https://imgur.com/a/x7fEZqg</a>
 Jerrasterix: and this article was factchecked by another idiot ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 5DN1L: Google search "swift was recently released by apple to make" -&gt; 385 results
 n0thing: Why im so stupid??? X(:disappointed:
 5DN1L: Because you don't realise you aren't that stupid in fact?
 oldtroll: Guys, can i go back somehow to last clas of code?
 oldtroll: To check the results etc
 jacek: you can go back to results in notification
 jacek: but not the clash itself
 oldtroll: but I didn't receive any notification on the last clash&#160;:(
 jacek: is it finished?
 oldtroll: hm, not sure about that, but it should be, I managed to eat 2 sandwiches in the meantime
 5DN1L: That depends on how quickly you eat your sandwiches lol
 oldtroll: well it also depends on other factors, but im rather slow eater
 5DN1L: Search your notifications. It should be there. If not, refresh and search again.
 oldtroll: oh, right, it was about page refresh, thanks!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 oldtroll: funny thing, from the last clash one could claim that people coding in java/javascript know maths and people coding in Python/C knows how to quickly code slow loops&#160;:)
 Viloo: why can't we see solutions after the clash. That would help a lot
 5DN1L: You can, if the other players are willing to share their code
 Miki09: Anyone can pls help me with the lucky number?
 Miki09: I got 66% because my python code is too slow
 IamFish: honestly, the most efficient way is just using a lookup table. As in just storing all the lucky numbers within the constraints in a list. Don't know how much you'll get out of that though haha
 jacek: use faster computer
 Miki09: thank for the advise :D
 Miki09: *advice
 Jerrasterix: correct me if I am wrong, DFS and BFS are both the same, except we use queues in BFS and stacks in DFS 
 Jerrasterix: &gt; Google search "swift was recently released by apple to make" -&gt; 385 results
 5DN1L: meaning probably many are just copying and pasting
 5DN1L: as the same opening sentence appears over many websites

 Jerrasterix: 5DN1L, i didn't mean that, did you read the 2nd line&#160;??
 5DN1L: hmmm?
 5DN1L: you mean fact check? has there been any fact check at all?
 Jerrasterix: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/0LkBqSW">https://imgur.com/0LkBqSW</a>
 Jerrasterix: I have marked it now
 5DN1L: ah that
 5DN1L: Objective-C = C# yay
 Jerrasterix: I died laughing :rofl
 Jerrasterix: :rofl:
 Jerrasterix: If it was C, mistake acknowledged, but referring a lang by their rivals :laughing: 
 Miki09: I cant find aneo sponsored contest anywhere
 5DN1L: Removed
 Miki09: Why?
 5DN1L: Sponsor finished i guess
 Miki09: Ok
 Jerrasterix: :sobL
 Jerrasterix: :sob:
 Jerrasterix: I was planning to do that
 Jerrasterix: I lost 100xp&#160;:(
 5DN1L: oh, is the achievement still in the available list?
 Jerrasterix: it is&#160;!!
 5DN1L: and clicking it leads to 404?
 Jerrasterix: 1 min
 Jerrasterix: it doesn't have a link anchored to it 
 5DN1L: ah right
 5DN1L: an achievement which can never be obtained again
 5DN1L: grab all the achievements while they last!!!
 Jerrasterix: We have one more tooo
 Jerrasterix: community contest thing for 2500xp
 5DN1L: another bug report then? :P
 Jerrasterix: that too is unachievable now!!
 Jerrasterix: I did for aneo now 
 5DN1L: i saw that
 Jerrasterix: added
 5DN1L: now let's wait for the response for who-knows-how-long :P
 Jerrasterix: where are BFS preferred over DFS&#160;??
 jacek: when you want the shortest fast
 Jerrasterix: Thanks jacek
 TimothyAlexisVass: Have you learned it yet Jerrasterix?
 willdrinkyourblood: "Index was outside the bounds of the array." "at Solution.Main on line 26" THERE IS SEMICOLON THERE WHAT 
 willdrinkyourblood: i do not understand
 willdrinkyourblood: my compiler is fine with the program, why doesn't this work here
 jacek: its not compilation error
 jacek: your array is too small
 Flaise: Good morning
 DavitJanashia1: good morning? where do you live?
 BIPIN_THE_KING: good morning?&#160;????? its good night for me bruh 
 Flaise: Just a tad west of the sun, evidently
 BIPIN_THE_KING: i am from india
 BlaiseEbuth: Sun? What is that?
 Flaise: BlaiseEbuth: Big scary ball of nuclear fusion that exists outside of the walls. Don't go out there; it'll burn you.
 Flaise: I mean, come to think of it
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream: That's for this kind of things I never go to the surface.
 Flaise: I've never actually SEEN the sun.
 Flaise: Yeh know, when I go outside, I don't look straight up into the sky. So for all I know, the light could be coming out of a flying spaghetti monster.
 jacek: oO

 Pargol: how is action Count action looks like , i can't understand why its' length is 7?
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth starts searching the context, lost, once more...</b></p><p><img src="/a/74920308780308" /> 5DN1L: Automaton2000, do you have anything of length 7?
 Automaton2000: could the validators in the repo not have been in a convenient format ffs...
 BlaiseEbuth: :smirk:
 5DN1L: Pargol, I can't understand either, can't help you. Neither can Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah that's a good idea
 balamalexis: bro why
 5DN1L: Pargol, this should be useful to you, though: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">https://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>

 Pargol: in othello game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/othello-1">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/othello-1</a> , i got difficulty on understanding what the input actionCount action looks like and why its length is 7, can anyone help me with that? 
 darkhorse64: It's the number of legal moves
 jacek: as the statement ( :scream: ) says: actionCount: the number of legal actions
 jacek: hmm, in the statement next line is "Next actionCount action: a string representing the action.". A typo i think&#160;:?
 jacek: ahh, its ok. just weirdly phrased&#160;:?
 Pargol: can you bring me an example for that because i still don't understant 
 jacek: what language?
 jacek: besides, the generated code should handle that
 jacek: where do you get 7? first turn has 4 possible moves
 jacek: first inputs
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06ee92c8-2c5e-4e0f-a533-2cd9468a57a8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06ee92c8-2c5e-4e0f-a533-2cd9468a57a8</a>
 Pargol: in the c version of the code that it get us at first the string that it get has length of 7, the things that you get is the thing that i thought it would be but it still just have 2 length.
 jacek: generator stub works differently for C i think. 7 is just the 'suggestion', the maximum. action will be always 2 length. action is available move, like "e6" mean you can put stone in square e6
 Pargol: thank you for your helps
 jacek: :tada:
 Flaise: jacek: I just checked the video. That is ridiculously adorable.
 jacek: :scream_cat:
 Flaise: :smiley_cat:
 rodrigoregex: JOAO
 oldtroll: what happens when time runs out during clash?
 TimothyAlexisVass: You will submit
 oldtroll: thing that is written on the screen? or the last tested one?
 BlaiseEbuth: You'll be prompted to choose between both.
 jacek: i dont know, i never run out of time during clash ~
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Oh joy, another caesar puzzle approvved
 oldtroll: jacek, i try to learn other languages during shortest clashes, because java is not the best option there&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: Is it anywhere?
 oldtroll: in classroom it's one of the best options I believe (and thats my level)
 oldtroll: and if you mean fastest/reverse clashes, for me it is in both
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: The next time they try to sell the company, someone will figure out 10% of the IP is caesar and rot13
 jacek: hm
 jacek: and they will patent it
 wlesavo: Hey, im trying to reproduce eulers downloading and it seems that they removed loginSiteV2 request, and loginSite requires some kind of captha code, is there any known workaround for using the api being logged in?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: He updated his NS python script
 wlesavo: oh, thx, ill check there
 wlesavo: yay it works, thx
 Flaise: oldtroll: Mmyep. Java is not good for code golf. I recall it being basically the opposite of that when I used it. :P
 Flaise: Personally, I don't like code golf challenges because Ruby is always going to be the winner. I don't want to practice Ruby but I want to place well anyway, so I always use Python and nothing else on Clash of Code.
 rodrigoregex: code gold challenge "print hello world". Java: System.out.println("hello world"). Python: print("hello world")
 rodrigoregex: golf*
 Flaise: Ruby: puts "hello world"
 rodrigoregex: Impossible use Java in code golf
 Flaise: Sometimes I wonder what kind of coder Ruby must have been made for, seeing as it came out /after/ Python. I like almost every aspect of Python slightly better than Ruby. Clearly it wasn't made for me, so who?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Isn't every new language by some autistic guy who takes issue with something nobody else cares about?
 Scarfield: it was made for someone annoyed at losing golf challenges
 TimothyAlexisVass: I think Ruby is related to PErl
 TimothyAlexisVass: Perl*
 rodrigoregex: @Scarfield that is true ahahhaha
 Flaise: Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: ...xD Well I mean, I used to hate Java's anti-codegolfness but then I started using C and C++ and learned what it was a backlash against.
 Flaise: Now I still don't want to use Java but at least it makes sense.
 Wontonimo: there is a discussion going on in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/747055c69ea64f62d078e21b592b7c16abfc">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/747055c69ea64f62d078e21b592b7c16abfc</a> about coordinate system.  My understanding is that on CG coordinates are supposed to have 0,0 in the upper left corner
 Scarfield: thats is the standard ye
 BlaiseEbuth: Standards are like hearts: made to be broken.
 Wontonimo: I can't find that standard anywhere ... remember reading it but can't find it.  Anyone able to share a link?
 Flaise: It's somewhere in here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/creating-your-own-puzzle">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/creating-your-own-puzzle</a>

 GamingGnawer: how do you use initializer lists with fixed size arrays?
 ZXC01: hi!
 GamingGnawer: Likeint x[5];Foo(int xin[])  :&#160;???
 ZXC01:&#160;?
 GamingGnawer: I'm making a class in c++and want to pass a fixed size array to the constructor
 ZXC01: o i use python sry
 LordMoopCow: Are the angles in pod racer in degrees or rads?

 Andrew_OHara: debugging is a huge hassle
 GamingGnawer: just neve make misstakes&#160;;)
 Andrew_OHara: That would be great, except instructions aren't always clear and complete, so I need to debug to see how it actually behaves. I can't do print debugging Im too stupid to keep up
 GamingGnawer: everyone makes misstakes and the better the coder the more complicated they are to fix :P
 GamingGnawer: why can't you do print-debugging?
 Dren: what languiage are you using
 ShivaHaze: is ECMAScript 6 used for the coding challenges?
 ShivaHaze: regarding JS
 Dren: probably
 ShivaHaze: aight ty
 Andrew_OHara: I can't do print debugging because it just confuses me. i need to be able to stop, inspect, then move on one line a time. I'm using either python or c# right now
 Dren: I mean with python I usually write a function to make it more simple
 Dren: that only prints stuff to stderr with whatever parameters are most suitable for the problem
 Flaise: Perhaps just learn to do print-debugging? Don't limit yourself by saying you can't do something just because it feels like a challenge.
 Dren: ture
 Dren: *True
 Dren: sorry can't spell booleans
 GamingGnawer: that is easy to debug atleast&#160;;)
 Dren: I'll just write bool(1)
 Flaise: ew &gt;_&lt;
 Dren: well rather str(bool(1)).lower()
 Dren: a short and simple way of saying 'true'
 Flaise: repr(bool(not 0)).kill().me_now()
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Huh.  They changed the name (and link) of the number spiral puzzle?
 Thorcode: hi I just finish the "blub or bilibo challenge" this is the link:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-of-the-rings">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-of-the-rings</a> can someone tell me tips of using loops and how to break a loop
 Flaise: o_O Most languages have a `break` keyword to end a loop early. Is that what you're talking about?
 Thorcode: try the puzzle flaise
 Thorcode: I know that most lang have a break func to end a loop
 Flaise: I may eventually but I'm working on other stuff now.
 Thorcode: thanks for your attention Flaise

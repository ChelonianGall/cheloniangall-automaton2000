 KiwiTae: Thor puzzle is so hard been trying for a week now&#160;:(
 KiwiTae: braaah
 Joe_no_name: KiwiTae do you have a question that I could maybe help out with?
 NuclearGiant_7d5: Has anyone here completed <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/skynet-revolution-episode-2">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/skynet-revolution-episode-2</a>&#160;?  Looking for a clue on the Agent behavior for the Core network.
 [CG]Thibaud: NuclearGiant_7d5 this article may help: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/dfs-agent-skynet/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/dfs-agent-skynet/</a>
 NuclearGiant_7d5: Thanks.  Checking it out.
 Andriamanitra: fun times with reverse problem, found an alternative pattern that works 100% with visible test cases and only got 20%&#160;:^)
 Marcollose: Is there any Dzurlord?
 KiwiTae: Joe_no_name I tell thor to go to the coodinate where the lamp is in the test, but then the validation test i dont know where the light is , so I cannot... Maybe hardcoding is not great ah &gt;,&lt; 
 Joe_no_name: How are you telling thor to get there?
 KiwiTae: Joe_no_name sorry I was just messing with you :raising_hand_tone1: Thanks though :D 
 KiwiTae: Joe_no_name are you working on a puzzle now?
 Joe_no_name: OH MAN! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ you got me good!  Last time I ever try to help anybody on here.  Yeah im about to finish the power of thor ep 1
 KiwiTae: pewpewpew
 Joe_no_name: Shots fired 
 pk359: hi
 [CG]Thibaud: hey pk359
 pk359: yes?
 [CG]Thibaud: simply saying hello :D

 dt200020: hi
 whay: hi
 AdvaitJ: hi
 Guiguim: Hello
 s3698211: Hello guys, have a great night 
 Tiramon: Andriamanitra are you talking about the optimization -&gt; Reverse Engineering?It's not hard to pass the testcases, as long as your output is valid
 Tiramon: the problem is to keep the score high&#160;;)
 Guiguim: whay why do you always give up&#160;?
 macobo: whay oh whay
 remi6: Hello
 shangcode: Hi
 Speedlulu: Hi, was the shortest code mode deleted from Clash of Code&#160;?
 Oceanman: nope
 Speedlulu: thank you
 Oceanman: same room tho
 Oceanman: lol
 Speedlulu: there really should be a way to chose which game mode you want to play
 Speedlulu: hey yeah
 Oceanman: yeah 
 Oceanman: reverse mode is fun
 jacek: in private clash you can
 macobo: reverse mode is super annoying :D 
 macobo: at least for a tryhard like me
 shangcode: I feel reverse mode is so cool, sounds like hacker's reverse engineering.:tophat:
 remi6: What about puzzles about physics and mathematics, macobo?
 macobo: Those Clash of code puzzles are generally not hard at all.&#160;:) I just find reverse mode really luck based.
 pvchopade204: yepp
 DarkyParky: i think golf (shortest mode) is annoying for many languages
 Oceanman: shortest mode is like a  punishment to c++ users
 macobo: At least it's predictable. The puzzles are easy (and short) as well, so using ruby isn't that hard there.&#160;:) But agreed, there's a learning curve.
 jistjoalal: why ppl with there actual human face in their profile pic always get smoked in clash of code?
 jistjoalal: and you know youre bout to get smoked when you see some weeb looking pic
 Uljahn: :smirk:
 macobo: A lot of the common faces are official bots apparently&#160;:)

 itzblinkzy: f
 _Akira_: good morning everybody
 _Akira_: :smiley:
 Logiman09: Hello
 itzblinkzy: hi guys
 whay: hi
 AntiSquid: hi
 whay: how are you
 itzblinkzy: good
 whay: you are irlanda
 whay: you have compueter windows 10
 AntiSquid: wrong, it's ubuntu 20
 eulerscheZahl: i think i should update. installed ubuntu 19.10 when i reinstalled my system. support expired now i think
 eulerscheZahl: do i dare a system upgrade? last time i tried (from 14 to 16 i think) it didn't work as expected and i ended up reinstalling it
 AntiSquid: really? isn't 18 still supported?
 whay: you have windows 7
 eulerscheZahl: there is the LTS version (long term support) with 5 years
 eulerscheZahl: but the one i installed has 9 months
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'll risk it, yolo
 Astrobytes: good luck!
 eulerscheZahl: The following packages will be upgraded: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff0d85f6-f834-4b57-8686-558e6fc367b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff0d85f6-f834-4b57-8686-558e6fc367b1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't sound that complicated after all
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's done already :D
 Astrobytes: lol, smallest upgrade ever
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i updated before without noticing
 eulerscheZahl: code = VS code
 Counterbalance: is it also apt-get dist-upgrade on ubuntu?
 whay: you can play with me world of tank blitz
 eulerscheZahl: i didsudo apt dist-upgrade
 eulerscheZahl: there is apt now. less typing than apt-get
 eulerscheZahl: and slightly different ASCII art
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know about the internals
 whay: iam telle:angry:
 AntiSquid: are you in oxford atm whay&#160;?
 whay: yeah
 AntiSquid: what are you studying?
 eulerscheZahl: let's meet up
 eulerscheZahl: start cooking AntiSquid, whay will be at your place soon
 AntiSquid: i did pizza and it's all gone now
 whay: programming
 el19oc: what kinda pizza?
 eulerscheZahl: pineapple
 Astrobytes: Eugh.
 AntiSquid: mushrooms, salami, cheese + (tomato and base)
 Astrobytes: I love mushrooms on pizzas
 AntiSquid: i think the beetroot pizza is worse than the pineapple one
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's eggplant + zucchini on the pizza
 AntiSquid: butternut squash and goats cheese works alright imo
 Astrobytes: beetroot? Weird.
 eulerscheZahl: but mushrooms are fine as well
 Astrobytes: Yeah, nice euler
 Astrobytes: I'm a huge fan of both 
 AntiSquid: ya it's some vegan pizza (the beetroot one) 
 whay: I want someone to talk to me:worried:
 whay: Ù†
 AntiSquid: i made my own from scratch though 
 Astrobytes: Best way
 Astrobytes: And you can actually get it crispy (or however you like it)
 el19oc: I let the pizza professionals handle it
 el19oc: everything I cook turns to ash
 whay: :sob:
 whay:  you can telle me
 Astrobytes: haha, cooking ain't for everyone I guess :D
 AntiSquid: use an oven timer
 eulerscheZahl: when you can read, you can cookfrom the Ratatouille movie, paraphrasing as i don't remember the exact wording
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't agree with it. i can read
 whay: :star_and_crescent: iam islamic
 Astrobytes: whay, can you please stop your nonsense. You've been at it for at least a week now.
 jjhiggz: Where do we go to report an error
 Astrobytes: jjhiggz start in here
 Astrobytes: What's the issue?
 eulerscheZahl: 50% chance we tell you it's not an error
 jjhiggz: I just did a challenge in dart, and when I changed my answer I was getting all of the correct outputs, but then the test results defaulted to 'expected nothing'
 jjhiggz: should I post my code?
 whay: What nonsense you do not want to speak with
 eulerscheZahl: and the problem statement
 jjhiggz: I'm not sure that I still have access to the problem statement it was a clash of code
 jjhiggz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b346884d-6252-4b2f-ab77-10eb6781d759">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b346884d-6252-4b2f-ab77-10eb6781d759</a>
 eulerscheZahl: somehow the command line update did nothing it seems. updating via GUI now...
 eulerscheZahl: do you remember parts of the wording?
 eulerscheZahl: of the statement
 jjhiggz: yeah the goal was to take two arrays
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: search it here
 jjhiggz: one containing x coordiantes
 el19oc: ah yes the ratatouille movie, a timeless classic
 el19oc: that's where I get all my inspiration from
 whay: I LOVE AXIS
 jjhiggz: its "crazy coordinates"
 whay: AXIS AXIS
 whay: NAZIS :flag_dz:
 AntiSquid: whay that's random spam and annoying
 eulerscheZahl: you print an extra , at the end jjhiggz
 jjhiggz: I had it outputting (1, 1),(5, 2),(9, 5)instead of 1, 1), (5, 2), (9, 5)
 AntiSquid: try to discuss topics closer to CG whay
 eulerscheZahl: the error messages isn't optimal in this case. we are complaining about it for years :D
 whay: I want to bother you because you do not talk to me, you consider me an offense
 AntiSquid: an offense to what
 AntiSquid: what puzzle are you doing whay?
 eulerscheZahl: you ignore the current chat topic and start spamming  :flag_dz: and such
 Astrobytes: For at least a week now
 jjhiggz: its not that with the extra comma, substring in dart is like slice in most languages so I'm cutting out the last character  with it
 Astrobytes: Surely boredom must set in after a while
 whay: I HATE ALL
 AntiSquid: i mean i directly addressed you like 5 times in the past 30 minutes, that's a privilege not an offense, whay :p
 AntiSquid: ok this is trolling
 AntiSquid: and really bad one
 jjhiggz: Plus the problem was actually that all the tests starting expecting the value 'not found' 
 whay: YOU ARE BAD MAN
 Astrobytes: Does it ignore the extra whitespace at the end as well jjhiggz? (I don't know Dart)
 AntiSquid: whay stop the nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: but are you BAN MAN?
 whay: I LOVE AXIS
 jjhiggz: Well thats what I'm saying is that, I don't think it was a dart thing. There were no console errors, but the EXPECTED values for the output all defaulted to "none" or something along those lines. 
 eulerscheZahl: it's a char by char comparison
 eulerscheZahl: when the expected is "abc" and you print "abcd", it tells you that it expected nothing
 Astrobytes: Yep. And that's the default error when the output isn't as expected (sadly)
 eulerscheZahl: that is after the "abc" which is correct. just misleading error message
 jjhiggz: Thats bizarre
 jjhiggz: ok
 eulerscheZahl: feel free to complain on the forum. it confuses a lot of users
 jjhiggz: haha
 eulerscheZahl: me included when I was new to CG
 eulerscheZahl: now i know the quirks
 jjhiggz: I'm going to Karen the S**t out of this until they fix it
 jjhiggz: not really though I'm too lazy
 eulerscheZahl: that's how we got D support
 jjhiggz: and need to put all my \efforts into getting a job
 eulerscheZahl: oh, good luck on that
 eulerscheZahl: did you find CG via an application? CG hosts job assessments as well
 inoryy: wait till you get to C++ pragmas
 Astrobytes: :grimacing:
 jjhiggz: no I found it through this youtube streamer based out of Denver. 
 jjhiggz: CJ with the codinggarden channel
 eulerscheZahl: a clasher.there's much more to discover on CG
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>that's what makes CG special
 el19oc: I was gonna ask
 el19oc: what bot programming challenge do you guys recommend?
 el19oc: other than csb and spring challenge
 inoryy: CSB! Oh...
 jjhiggz: I gotta do some of those, I appreciate the guidance amigo
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html">http://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html</a>scroll to the bottom, sort by community rating
 eulerscheZahl: we are all biased in some way. but with lots of votes something reasonable may pop up
 Astrobytes: And feel free to ask for advice/help here
 jjhiggz: this website is pretty amazing I'm not going to lie.  
 Astrobytes: el19oc - really depends on what you like
 jjhiggz: Its way more interactive than codewars
 eulerscheZahl: it's even possible to upload your own multiplayer games on this website
 jjhiggz: whattt?
 el19oc: ayy, thanks
 el19oc: that list's useful
 jjhiggz: As in like through the clashCode format?
 eulerscheZahl: takes a lot of effort to create one though
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>
 jjhiggz: or as in like you can full on design a whole game?
 whay: HI AGAIN
 whay: HAHAHA
 jjhiggz: Oh wow thats pretty cool
 Astrobytes: Whole game, puzzles, clashes, optimasation games, you can make all of those
 jjhiggz: I see some chemistry ones
 sanskriti: hii
 jjhiggz: Do people actually get jobs through this website?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, there is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>
 jjhiggz: and in order to do it, do they have to be complete bawwses at coding?
 whay: YOU ARE STUIPUD
 eulerscheZahl: hiring companies send you a link to an online exam
 el19oc: rude
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid hammer required
 eulerscheZahl: in the past CG also held sponsored contests where you could choose from a list of companies where you want to apply
 jjhiggz: Oh wow, thats awesome. 
 sanskriti: busy people
 jjhiggz: I need to be more active here, I feel like if I got in the swing of things I could easily crunch out five hours a day on this site and time would fly by
 AntiSquid: lol i wasted time in private and he pretended to understand
 inoryy: aside from the actual hiring channels the practice on the website will help; played a role for me at least
 Astrobytes: It's not IAmNoob/python_programer is it? Also had the University of Oxford thing, and about the same level of English skills
 eulerscheZahl: also something you can mention on your application. shows passion
 inoryy: yeah
 jjhiggz: Do employers look for specific languages on this site. It definitely seems like it would be easier to perform well on code clashes in other non-dart languages
 jjhiggz: I noticed most of the people crushing it are c++ or python, and sometimes Javascript, but I've been doing dart challenges because I'm trying to learn flutter and I suck at statically typed languages
 macobo: Programming languages are like socks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i like that quote
 Counterbalance: waiting for the punchline...
 jjhiggz: So don't use old programming languages?
 eulerscheZahl: you can change them
 jjhiggz: lol
 inoryy: you always lose one side
 macobo: And if you don't, you'll smell&#160;:)
 jjhiggz: Programming languages get crusty if you spend too much time alone?
 Counterbalance: ieuw
 jjhiggz: I revoke that, too far my apologies
 AntiSquid: 3 programmers walked into a pub
 eulerscheZahl: the first programmer said:
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes your turn to continue
 Astrobytes: "Is it my round?"
 eulerscheZahl: to which the second programmer replied:
 Astrobytes: ...
 jjhiggz: "That depends, what pair of socks are you wearing"
 Counterbalance: syntax error: unexpected string literal
 eulerscheZahl: lame joke, you messed it up
 AntiSquid: was intending to tell a joke with a missing punch line ...
 inoryy: well glad we're on a programming site and not comedy club, you'd be out of jobs
 Astrobytes: Show us how it's done then inoryy
 AntiSquid: but sure let's say they were coding their poker bots and one of them was using D in release mode
 eulerscheZahl: dist upgrade changed some icons :rage:
 Astrobytes: 3 programmers walk into a pub, the first holds up 2 fingers and say "3 beers please"...
 inoryy: Three logicians walk into a bar. The barman says, 'Does everybody want a drink?'
 inoryy: first one says "I don't know"
 inoryy: second one says "I don't know"
 eulerscheZahl: last: no
 inoryy: third one says Yes
 inoryy: ha
 eulerscheZahl: wait i'm stupid
 Astrobytes: That's an old one inoryy :D
 inoryy: well, I'm an old one
 Astrobytes: Old! You're a young whippersnapper.
 Astrobytes: (not really, just putting my "old man" voice on)
 AntiSquid: "don't patronize me son"
 eulerscheZahl: i'm here to relax, don't teach me new vocabulary :scream:
 Counterbalance: oxymoron
 AbundantPuddle: An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first one orders a beer, the second one orders half a beer, the third one orders a quarter of a beer, the fourth orders an eighth and at about this time the bartender says "Let me just stop you right there." He pours two beers out for them and says "the problem with you mathematicians is you need to know your limits."
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: hey imo that's good
 Astrobytes: It's probably the best one so far
 AntiSquid: but why did he pour 2 beers at the end?
 AbundantPuddle: I wish I could take credit for it, but I heard it from somewhere else.
 inoryy: geometric series sum to 2
 AbundantPuddle: Because that will cover  the infinite number of mathematicians.
 AntiSquid: is it because of some sort of infinite series formula? it still sounds as if it won't go above the one beer
 AbundantPuddle: It won't.
 Counterbalance: the first orders the 1 beer, the rest the 2nd
 AbundantPuddle: Correct.
 Counterbalance: had me confused too
 AntiSquid: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/GeometricSquares.svg/220px-GeometricSquares.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/GeometricSquares.svg/220px-GeometricSquares.svg.png</a>
 jjhiggz: a testing engineer walks into a bar
 jjhiggz: he orders a beer
 eulerscheZahl: not exactly the image i was looking for
 jjhiggz: then he orders 20 beers
 jjhiggz: then he orders -20 beers
 jjhiggz: then he orders 9000 beers
 jjhiggz: then he orders an infinite amount of beers
 jjhiggz: they all worked so he walked out of the bar
 el19oc: then he gets thrown out
 AntiSquid: no string / special chars?
 jjhiggz: the bar breaks
 Astrobytes: ffs
 jjhiggz: Hey I'm still a newb gimme a break
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Wasn't bad
 AbundantPuddle: Lol
 eulerscheZahl: dist upgrade complete, still working \o/
 Astrobytes: nice, strange the commandline upgrade didn't work tho
 eulerscheZahl: no idea why
 eulerscheZahl: had to exit i3 and start the default ubuntu UI
 eulerscheZahl: no idea how I could use this as my main environment for years
 eulerscheZahl: felt so inefficient
 eulerscheZahl: audio is screwed up again, so much noise. had that problem before, the last dist fixed it
 eulerscheZahl: now it's back&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Haven't used any linux flavours for a while tbh. Started on SuSE (work purposes) then went to slackware to learn stuff, then fedora. Way out of shape these days.
 jjhiggz: So what types of programmers are y'all?
 AntiSquid: damn i remember i was going to check out manjaro when it first comes out, still didn't have a look at it, it was so hyped on some linux related videos ...
 AntiSquid: guess jjhiggz
 Astrobytes: Oh actually, Kali and Debian too
 Astrobytes: I'm not jjhiggz, just casual
 eulerscheZahl: i'm the type of programmer who pretents to know stuff while being completely incompetent&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah right
 eulerscheZahl: works as long as others know even less
 jjhiggz: isn't that how everybody feels
 AntiSquid: euler suffers from the imposter syndrome jjhiggz
 AbundantPuddle: I pretend like I don't know anything.
 AbundantPuddle: Except it's not pretending.
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes pretending that can help you dodge some work
 Astrobytes: What, like the latest version of C#? :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: 8 i think. and 9 coming up
 eulerscheZahl: and i failed to read :D
 eulerscheZahl: got a private message:
 Astrobytes: Quite! :D
 eulerscheZahl: whay 08:58PMYOUR FRIENDS IS BAND METELLE HIM IM SORRYPLEASE
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: that's meant for you AntiSquid i guess
 eulerscheZahl: message delivered, i'll ask for my cookie now
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 AntiSquid: 3 parts flour, 2 parts butter, 1 part sugar, knead it and shape it into cookies, bake for about 15 mins at 160, there's your cookie
 eulerscheZahl: i'll send him this as your reply
 eulerscheZahl: he doesn't have the chat in between
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5b31b49-b314-4f7b-8ed1-f992c85dfe9d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5b31b49-b314-4f7b-8ed1-f992c85dfe9d</a>
 Astrobytes: Perfect
 eulerscheZahl: i'm childishly laughing right now
 Astrobytes: It's appropriate :D
 el19oc: I bet he's pleasantly surprised
 eulerscheZahl: he doesn't believe me that this was the reply
 el19oc: ask him what kind of reply he was hoping for
 Astrobytes: Well, in these times of fake news eh 
 AbundantPuddle: I was going to say you other countries have some weird cookies with 15 minutes at 160. Then I realized you were probably referring to celsius.
 AntiSquid: i thought you wanted the cookie lol ... might get messaged by thibaud asking me about that last part
 AntiSquid: ya celsius
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, that makes a lot more sense. Lmao.
 eulerscheZahl: we are Europeans. of course we use Celsius
 eulerscheZahl: and meters
 AntiSquid: UK is stuck somewhere between the two worlds afaik
 Astrobytes: Yes. It's incredibly annoying.
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, the standard here is Fahrenheit. 160 F is about 71 C.
 Astrobytes: Anything other than metric is just trying to be difficult for the hell of it
 itzblinkzy: yep
 AbundantPuddle: I agree 100 percent.
 itzblinkzy: i hate the imperial system
 Astrobytes: Brits and Americans ofc are not known for that particular trait... 
 AntiSquid: i think you can still slow cook at 71 C :p
 AbundantPuddle: We don't even use the imperial system. It's a modified version of the imperial system.
 eulerscheZahl: we should switch to Kelvin for temperatures
 AbundantPuddle: How about Kevins instead?
 AbundantPuddle: It's a new unit.
 Astrobytes: Sure, makes more sense than Fahrenheit (Kelvins that is)
 eulerscheZahl: that's how you measure intelligence, isn't it?
 AbundantPuddle: 1 kevin = 25 C
 Astrobytes: Karens for distance and Kevins for temperature?
 AbundantPuddle: Yes
 AbundantPuddle:&#160;!
 AbundantPuddle: And Kyles for mass
 Astrobytes: Chads for force
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 Deeps2104: whtsUp folks
 el19oc: haha, just destroying all the code I just wrote, the usual
 AntiSquid: geez what is this guy going to upload next? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrIbQ0pIFOg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrIbQ0pIFOg</a>
 itzblinkzy: nemmtor share your code please?
 Schneewittchen: @AntiSquid Ideal opportunity to build on this! Love it
 Scarfield: what a time to be alive
 Astrobytes: Scarfalive
 Scarfield: AlivestroBytes
 Astrobytes: lol, how's things
 Scarfield: good good, managed to get into wood1 in othello, and searching for the next thing to implement&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, I saw that when I was working on it yesterday, gj&#160;:)
 Scarfield: stable cells in eval seems to be a good metric i am not using yet. ty
 Astrobytes: Are you MCTSing or alphabeta?
 Scarfield: MCTS IPT
 Astrobytes: Yeah I still have to implement stability
 Astrobytes: IPT?
 Scarfield: Immediate Propagation Termination :p
 Scarfield: somehow worked better with that i have now, than EPT
 Astrobytes: Never heard of it. It sounds like organic chemistry
 Astrobytes: What is it?
 Scarfield: i think smitsi mentioned it last week. Just no rollout, but eval at leaf nodes
 Astrobytes: That's EPT tho
 Scarfield: so immediate instead of early :p
 Scarfield: EPT has rollout of some depth (?)
 Astrobytes: Meh, I still call it EPT
 Astrobytes: 0 is still early!
 Scarfield: sure xD
 Scarfield: VEPT
 Astrobytes: But yeah, the Immediate suits it better
 Astrobytes: lol, Very EArly
 Scarfield: premature even
 Astrobytes: PPT
 Scarfield: you are using AB right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Was considering trying out EPT to see how it goes, but still working on my ab
 Scarfield: what depths do you reach?
 Astrobytes: 9-15 currently
 Scarfield: nice
 Astrobytes: Iterative deepening, aspiration windows, working in the TT soon hopefully
 Scarfield: hmm for some reason i havent thought of working on that for othello, but i suppose there are plenty of instances where it will be the same states
 Astrobytes: I'm hoping to get probcut working but I broke my offline runner earlier, need to fix it tomorrow
 Scarfield: still havent read about it, but its something about pruning i gathered from chat?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, regression based
 Astrobytes: Pretty cool
 MSmits: hey
 Scarfield: :wave:
 MSmits: I'm still fitting parameters for othello&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: And I'm loving the other approaches with TD and n-tuples etc
 Astrobytes: Great to see all these different approaches
 Astrobytes: Ofc MSmits :D
 Scarfield: TD?
 Astrobytes: Ah temporal difference learning
 MSmits: got a version with 30% dbd r 40% jace k 50% tric trac 100% renard but 10% robo&#160;:(
 MSmits: frontiers worked 
 Astrobytes: That's a pretty good bot already
 MSmits: yeah
 Scarfield: have been thinking that shouldnt MiniMax AB outplay MCTS EPT assuming the same performance on sim?
 MSmits: still plenty to fit and refit though
 Astrobytes: And glad you got frontiers working, low weight right?
 jacek: and hows frontiers weight now?
 MSmits: similar to yours i  think
 MSmits: I have mobility 900 frontiers 550
 MSmits: so similar ratio
 jacek: you mean frontiers negative&#160;:?
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: phew
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: i have had versions that did 65% vs you too jacek, but they sucked too much against others, that one was 10% tric trac
 MSmits: so, a lot of rps
 jacek: i wonder, what is the practical max mobility. 30 possible moves?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield - depends on a lot of factors I guess
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: i dont see 30 really
 MSmits: thats huge
 Astrobytes: 30 is a lot
 MSmits: run a million games in selfplay with some randomness and take the max&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe record statistics, get a nice bell curve
 Scarfield: and flatten it
 Astrobytes: Orrrr.... we wait for you to do this and tell us about it in a wall of text chat sermon&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: no no, not me
 MSmits: too busy
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: been plugging some yavalath book holes 
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 MSmits: people were still winning games 
 MSmits: now it's like 3 out of 100
 MSmits: those damn mcts bots
 MSmits: too much random
 MSmits: pb 4 and dark horse  are the toughest
 jacek: hmm early results indicate max 23 mobility
 MSmits: sounds right
 Scarfield: but MM should be able to get deeper than MCTS EPT since MCTS goes through the same sims over and over. And since its EPT its based on an eval anyway
 MSmits: average depth, yes Scarfield
 Scarfield: at least thats what i think, wondering why it works so well :D
 jacek: found 25
 MSmits: mcts has selective depth, the deepest nodes will be deeper than those with minimax
 MSmits: but they will have bad statistics of course
 Scarfield: sure, thats the difference of course
 MSmits: also, mcts estimates the overall strength of a board state with statistics wheras minimax just looks that the best min/max at the max depth level
 Scarfield: near future good eval, leads to a propable further future eval
 jacek: well thats probably why multi probcut works here
 MSmits: trappy games favor minimax because it finds the one rare line of play that kills you
 Astrobytes: yes jacek
 Scarfield: i thought the propcut was new, noticed this reference ealier:
 Scarfield: M. Buro, Experiments with Multi-ProbCut and a NewHigh-Quality Evaluation Function for Othello, Workshopon game-tree search, NECI, 1997. 
 MSmits: why would it work better here as opposed to other games 
 MSmits: it's not new, it just doesnt work in many games I think
 jacek: maybe the eval is more 'smooth' in othello. shallow search eval can estimate deeper eval
 MSmits: that would mean mcts should be strong as welll at least mcts with eval
 jacek: well im using best first search and it works better than my ab
 MSmits: you mean, uct guided search?
 Astrobytes: Yes but the multi probcut is 'trained' offline
 Scarfield: cheats!
 jacek: yes. its like mcts ept but with negamaxing propagation
 Astrobytes: jacekmax
 MSmits: so you dont record statistics, but do the min/max thing?
 Astrobytes: I think I came across this approach somewhere
 MSmits: only in an uneven tree
 MSmits: that is deeper in some places
 MSmits: you can get some horizon effect problems in some games with this
 MSmits: I have to correct for that with ept as well
 MSmits: not so much in Othello though
 jacek: yes. but i still final select child with most visits, not best eval score (aside from avoidiing provn loses)
 MSmits: hmm ok
 jacek: and yes, my bot became stronger but more blind
 jacek: i started to losing to weaklings more
 Astrobytes: So derogatory :P
 MSmits: hehe
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Best-First_Minimax_Search">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Best-First_Minimax_Search</a>
 Astrobytes: yeah that's where I saw it
 jacek: i think the line of actions guys (yes, those from mcts solver paper) use mcts-ab
 MSmits: whats that
 MSmits: Winands right?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: fellow Dutchies
 Scarfield: lol just started reading about multi-probcut... its a pruning array(?)
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well
 jacek: the same as jacekmax, but they use shalow alpha-beta instead of simple eval
 MSmits: you look up stuff and then do some probability calc
 MSmits: below some treshold you cut
 Scarfield: then i think JaCegMax would be more fitting :p
 MSmits: ceg as in cegprak?
 Astrobytes: joke's been done already Out-of-the-loop-field :P
 jacek: scarvolume
 Astrobytes: (but yeah, totally :D )
 Scarfield: :cry:
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/0JElywbkSbY?t=6">https://youtu.be/0JElywbkSbY?t=6</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: sleepy sleeps
 Scarfield: :zzz:
 jacek: why zzzz indicates sleep
 Scarfield: sleepy sleeps doesntP :thinking:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/27045/how-did-the-letter-z-come-to-be-associated-with-sleeping-snoring">https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/27045/how-did-the-letter-z-come-to-be-associated-with-sleeping-snoring</a>
 Astrobytes: 'catching some z's" is the origin, but I donno the reason
 Scarfield: lol kinda like the different origin stories of "ok"
 Astrobytes: That's a rabbit hole not worth exploring lol
 tomatoes: mosquitos
 Astrobytes: hm?
 Astrobytes: Oh. 'zzzzzz'
 tomatoes: when you're trying to sleep they're doing bzzzzzz
 Astrobytes: The worst part is when it stops.
 Astrobytes: Light goes on, nearest flat object is picked up, "where is that little shit!"
 MSmits: I electrocute them
 MSmits: zzzzzap
 Scarfield: with or without a wet sponge?
 MSmits: without
 MSmits: i know, it's cruel
 Scarfield: savage
 Astrobytes: Percy!
 Astrobytes: *Poicy
 MSmits: dont get either =/
 Astrobytes: The Green Mile?
 MSmits: yeah I saw that
 MSmits: i got the sponge thing
 Astrobytes: Percy... the guy that electrocutes Del without the spong
 Astrobytes: e
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Astrobytes: "Ah din't know sponge s'posed to be wet"
 Scarfield: your memory is too good
 Astrobytes: I've seen that film a lot over the years.
 Astrobytes: I prefer the Shawshank Redemption tbh if we're going with Stephen King adaptations
 Scarfield: i have only seen it once i think, 15 years ago or something. Kung Pow i have seen 5 times though xD
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I've seen that a few times too
 Astrobytes: Iron Sky?
 MSmits: I like Desperation, if we're talking Stephen King
 MSmits: and of course. IT
 Astrobytes: Did they make a movie of Desperation? (tak)
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: I only know the book (taktak)
 MSmits: i missed it too, but i found it in video rental at some point
 Scarfield: yea once, but can remember almost nothing, saw it with a friend and some :writing_hand:
 Astrobytes: Interesting. IT ofc is awesome
 MSmits: better than you would expect of such a hard to find movie
 MSmits: i like both IT movies, the first and the remake
 MSmits: I really dont know which is best
 Astrobytes: Same
 Astrobytes: There's parts I like better in both
 MSmits: you have to correct for nostalgia, some people cant let go of an earlier version so they always find it best
 Astrobytes: And then I change my mind
 MSmits: yeah both have parts that are better
 MSmits: I did not like the spider ending of the first
 Astrobytes: Book still beats any of the adaptations, but I thought the remake was worthy
 MSmits: first was a bit scarier i think 
 Astrobytes: Was just about to say that
 Astrobytes: Much darker
 MSmits: yeah
 Scarfield: wise penny
 MSmits: I read most of stephen king i think
 MSmits: they are making a new one arent they?
 MSmits: arent they making lisey's story?
 MSmits: that is one of the best
 Astrobytes: Oh really? I didn't know that
 MSmits: i vaguely remember hearing it somewhere
 MSmits: might be wrong
 Astrobytes: I wish they would make a decent version of the Stand
 MSmits: ah yeah i read that
 MSmits: that story has been done to death though
 MSmits: not the stephen king one
 MSmits: but general, apocalypse stories. Lately they pop up all over
 Astrobytes: True, but you need the King-iness to make it special
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: if they succeed. The movies are hit and miss
 Astrobytes: Always
 MSmits: well tbh, i havent seen that many i didnt like
 Astrobytes: The Pet Sematary remake was OK I thought
 MSmits: not sure if i saw that, how old is it?
 Astrobytes: It had the balance of humour and darkness just right
 Astrobytes: Last year
 MSmits: then i didnt see it yet
 Astrobytes: It's worth a watch
 MSmits: will do
 MSmits: i still need to watch picard
 Astrobytes: It's even got John Lithgow in it
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: as Jud&#160;;)
 MSmits: dont remember who jud was in the book
 MSmits: been a while
 Astrobytes: The old guy
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: And yeah, get on Picard. Rewatching it atm, still fantastic
 MSmits: would have required some serious irishman tech to make john the young guy
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 AntiSquid: have you tried the orville&#160;?
 MSmits: seen bits and pieces
 MSmits: comedy central
 MSmits: never watched full episode
 Astrobytes: No, I know it though. Is it decent?
 Scarfield: its actually decent
 Astrobytes: Cool
 Scarfield: i was pleasently suprised or how you say
 MSmits: will watch it at some point
 AntiSquid: not sure ... i dropped it at first few episodes, then read some reviews that the shows starts getting good around ep 5
 Scarfield: very similar to star trek in. terrible acting, decent - good subjects for the plots
 Astrobytes: I can do slow first episodes/series. I made it through DS9 so I can watch anything
 AntiSquid: this just reminded me of Odyssey V ... show was cancelled and i was looking forward to the big reveal&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Btw, although Picard is Star Trek through and through, it's totally not. And blows most of Trek out the water.
 AntiSquid: i liked that show, although it's kinda weird, random
 Scarfield: how about Buck Rogers?
 MSmits: Deep space 9 is my favorite ST
 Astrobytes: The only Buck Rogers I liked was that song by Feeder
 Astrobytes: MSmits - once the Dominion got involved it became interesting, and then magnificent by the end
 MSmits: true, but i liked it before that also
 AntiSquid: i only liked the original with captain kirk
 AntiSquid: and the ooooooooo intro
 MSmits: because compared to TNG and voyager (to a lesser extent) there is an actual storyline 
 Astrobytes: The first series or so were slowww though
 Astrobytes: TNG developed better after Gene Roddenberry died
 AntiSquid: i've read the books for the first series too
 Astrobytes: Or got ill even
 MSmits: yeah TNG did have some development and voyager too, but DS9 beats it
 Astrobytes: He was clinging to the original series formula
 AntiSquid: and the old Star Trek movies were my favorites
 Astrobytes: The writers had other ideas, DS9 was an evolution of that
 MSmits: I don't really like any of the star trek movies tbh
 Astrobytes: I love all the ST movies
 Astrobytes: old and new
 Astrobytes: The old ones were a staple of my childhood!
 MSmits: well they were ok i guess, but the series beat the movies for me
 MSmits: babylon 5 was also a great sci fi series I think
 Scarfield: was close to naming my frontier function FinalFrontier for othello
 MSmits: do it
 MSmits: it will pefrorm better
 Astrobytes: I saw The Final Frontier, The Undiscovered Country (v and VI), Generations, First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis in the cinema
 MSmits: oh I did like first contact
 MSmits: the only one i saw multiple times i thin
 Astrobytes: Insurrection is OK, Nemesis was messy but had good plotlines on the go - Picard follows on from the final events of that btw so you might wanna give it a watch
 MSmits: nemesis?
 Astrobytes: The last TNG movie
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: will do that then
 Astrobytes: I enjoyed the more recent ones too actually
 Astrobytes: But prefer the older ones
 AntiSquid: does the new Kirk fit his role?
 Astrobytes: I thought he captured it pretty well
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EamOsFwXgAEG-pj.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EamOsFwXgAEG-pj.jpg</a> 
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 AntiSquid: star trek 4 was planned for this year can't find if it's cancelled
 Astrobytes: Yeah, gotta wait for next series of Picard too
 Astrobytes: I never got on with the newer series of ST they made, Enterprise and Discovery
 MSmits: Enterprise was not halfbad. I did not like discovery
 Astrobytes: Enterprise was worth it just for Scott Bakula, keep expecting Al to pop up with his cigar
 MSmits: lol yeah
 MSmits: quantum leap right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah :D
 MSmits: I never watched that show fully, in order, but it popped up on our tv sometimes when i was young
 Astrobytes: Ziggy wasn't it? The little computer thingy
 MSmits: vaguely remember that
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I watched it cause my mum and dad did
 Astrobytes: Hated the theme tune for Enterprise though
 AntiSquid: have you seen Andromeda
 Astrobytes: Yeah, didn't really dig it at all tbh
 AntiSquid: i liked the first 80% of it i think
 AntiSquid: up to the Abyss nonsense
 Astrobytes: I guess it was better than EArth: Final Conflict
 MSmits: mmh where do i watch picard?
 MSmits: i tried cbs but they want a zipcode thats valid and mine apparently isnt
 MSmits: i guess it's US only
 Astrobytes: I think I got it from 1337
 MSmits: whats that
 Astrobytes: well, I pirated it, put it that way
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Astrobytes: Torrents 
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: i havent done that in a long time
 Astrobytes: Try before you buy!
 AntiSquid: lots of good sci-fi stories that never made it to the screen and it's hard to dig for them, especially when everyone has their own preferences and therefore you can't ask anyone for advice @_@
 MSmits: brb
 AntiSquid: biased opinion
 Astrobytes: I'll watch anything tbh, then decide
 AntiSquid: did you read Nightfall?
 Astrobytes: Sometimes you get a recommendation that's good for you
 AntiSquid: if yes then check the movie out and be amazed how much they managed to trash a good book
 Astrobytes: Asimov?
 AntiSquid: what site do you use for recommendations
 AntiSquid: yes Asimov
 AntiSquid: see a lot of people hate Asimov and his style
 Astrobytes: Yeah I did, I've read most of his stuff. Never heard about the movie. They're doing Foundation now I think
 AntiSquid: because "it's too simple" , he didn't open the metaphor floodgate
 Astrobytes: I only take recommendations from people I speak to/know
 Astrobytes: Otherwise I decide by myself
 Astrobytes: It's good to keep an open mind
 AntiSquid: Clarkesworldmagazine is a perfect example of what i consider not-real-sci-fi, pretentious bs writing
 MSmits: i did read foundation
 AntiSquid: and whenever i try a new "sci-fi" book that popular, i often end up remembering that site
 Astrobytes: Yeah I don't bother with all that crap AntiSquid, as long as you can find new releases etc it's good. Pay no mind to that opinionated drivel
 Astrobytes: Same goes for reviews of most things tbh
 AntiSquid: that's not it, i am just saying i have difficulties finding what (imo) is real sci-fi 
 MSmits: what is real sci fo?
 MSmits: fi?
 AntiSquid: because a lot of stuff takes on that label
 Astrobytes: Yeah, good luck. It used to be a simple case of go to the library, enter scifi section
 Astrobytes: Nowadays genres are merged
 AntiSquid: MSmits maybe you have more luck than me or you enjoy different kind of books, but i come across fantasy stuff labeled as sci-fi, or stories that just contain some futuristic electric devices used in personal household but the story focuses on something completely different and comes across as reading a completely different genre
 Astrobytes: Teen vampire goes to space = scifi. That sort of crap
 MSmits: fantasy really should not be labeled sci fi
 MSmits: though some books are in both genres
 MSmits: try the coldfire trilogy
 MSmits: one of the best series i ever read
 MSmits: it's very like a fantasy series but with a strong sci fi backdrop
 Astrobytes: Must say, even though the guy's a total dick and it's not really my thing, I actually enjoyed the Legacy of the Aldenata series by John Ringo (military scifi)
 Astrobytes: (aka Posleen War series)
 MSmits: will check that out
 Astrobytes: Miss out the Cally's War books and Watch on the Rhine
 MSmits: sure, I'll probably just read the main stories, unless 
 MSmits: I really like them
 Astrobytes: (side-stories and spinoffs, some are good but those are naff)
 macobo: Ooh, book suggestions!
 Astrobytes: It's quite heavy on the military gung-ho stuff, but good storylines
 macobo: Let me contribute: The Sword of Kaigen is one of the best fantasy books I've read in recent years.
 MSmits: Black company series is awesome
 Astrobytes: Shall check the chat history later, I'm out for tonight guys
 MSmits: by Glen cook
 Astrobytes: gn all
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: gn
 dmoa: absolute bullshit
 pedrosorio:&#160;?
 mohsinalipro: yeah!
 mohsinalipro: i am new to the codinggame.com
 ismailkarsli: Ok looks like im a stupid according to this site
 Joe_no_name: how do I read debug messages?  Could somebody explain alittle?
 pedrosorio: @ismailkarsli why?
 ismailkarsli: @pedrosorio because im staring like "hamster staring at camera" meme
 pedrosorio: that does mean you're stupid, probably just unfamiliar with the kind of problem you are looking at
 pedrosorio: does not mean*
 ismailkarsli: First one makes more sense :D Thanks for the morale. I hope I could improve
 pedrosorio: sure, what kind of problem are you looking at?
 ismailkarsli: It  was like finding midpoint of two coordinates
 pedrosorio: did you manage to solve it?
 ismailkarsli: Nope, i didn't know how to do it. Looks like i was should divide the x and y coordinates to 2 or something like that
 ismailkarsli: Yep, I was should add the x and y coordinates and divide them by 2.
 pedrosorio: yep
 tecnosam: hello
 mogzhey: hi
 pedrosorio: hi
 pedrosorio: my 100th clash of code
 pedrosorio: woohoo
 Laminator: leggo
 pedrosorio: leggo?
 pedrosorio: I'm convinced some people don't understand the goal of "shortest mode" in clash of code (e.g. @JayEm94 and @MathieuGanesan )
 johnny1man: rude?
 dantheking-crypto: lol
 pedrosorio: the only other possibility is they hate that mode so much that they just implement something as quick as possible and submit
 Laminator: It was my least favorite mode for a while. But it also ended up being the mode I learned the most from. I love it now whenever good programmers share their code.
 remi6: pedrosorio, they are bots, check their profile.
 Laminator: wow fuck some of them reverse problems
 itzblinkzy: hate those
 itzblinkzy: i can only do the predictable and ez ones
 pedrosorio: I wish there were more of those and fewer of the shortest mode
 itzblinkzy: i prefer fastest mode
 itzblinkzy: i dont want golfed code im trying to learn
 Kariin: idc as long as it's not math problems
 pedrosorio: and just after I said that got a 3rd place in a reverse problem lol
 itzblinkzy: yeah i cant do math problems
 itzblinkzy: im bad at math :pensive:
 itzblinkzy: ngoc please share your code if you please
 Laminator: I always thought math and programming were hand in hand. But I've met a lot of programmers that hate math. Can't really empathize. I like both lol

 msd9126: oops
 msd9126: how to quit world?
 MadKnight: why would u want to quit world, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is this one of the other
 runespirit:  nt 
 YodaMaster123: You guys have a chatbot?
 Uljahn: AutomatonNN: what is a chatbot?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the contest linked on the leaderboard and still have to timeout 
 KiwiTae: o/
 rockstar555: hii
 linjoehan: hey it's Advent of code time again
 jacek: oh my
 Uljahn: KoL's Crimbo season grind time again
 JervzBot: ulol
 B-O: somebody once told me
 B-O: somebody once told me
 B-O: people don't wanna sing nowadays
 Astrobytes: it's a chat. On a coding website. Sing elsewhere.
 wlesavo: are you telling only once though?
 B-O: you're goddamn right astro
 Astrobytes: Uljahn: thank you, I just remembered to click on my Advent Calendar
 Uljahn: :santa:
 rockstar555: hii
 Astrobytes: lol
 Uljahn: :neutral_face:
 Astrobytes: he's been doing the same thing for weeks now Uljahn
 Astrobytes: tbh he should've been banned a while ago
 Wyman: hi
 Wyman: :grinning:
 Wyman: I am new here. Is anybody?
 geppoz: hy Wyman
 YodaMaster123: I'm new too Wyman
 jacek: good afternoon
 YodaMaster123: Is the guy at the top of othello using Multi-probcut? Like in Logistello?
 Wyman: hi geppoz
 Wyman: hi YodaMaster123
 YodaMaster123: Hi
 Wyman: Why did I see your sentence in red before?
 jacek: YodaMaster123 he uses mcts with EPT, but he also uses big opening book
 YodaMaster123: Why does a big opening book help?
 geppoz: when in a message there is a name of an user, it becomes red for that user, wyman
 Wyman: wow
 Astrobytes: the 3rd guy uses multi-probcut
 Wyman: wonderful
 jacek: apparently opening book helps in othello. also m smits generated opening moves to counter-move the top bots :p
 YodaMaster123:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: was jacekmax for you right jacek?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: why do you speak red, Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: It's magic jacek
 YodaMaster123: Is the alert system the reason why you guys never use a person's username exactly?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, avoiding unwanted pings
 Wyman: me too
 jacek: AutomatonNN is that so?
 AutomatonNN: Ì¤ 
 ZarthaxX: what i advent of code?
 Astrobytes: what o advent of code ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: is
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZarthaxX: funny
 ZarthaxX: someone please ban this mod
 Astrobytes: Like an advent calendar with problems of increasing difficulty each day
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: ahhh okey
 ZarthaxX: and it says day 1 isnt worth shit
 Astrobytes: Never done it tbh
 ZarthaxX: i mean, it said that the reason was because of an outage
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: Because of an outage during the day 1 puzzle unlock, day 1 is worth no points.
 ZarthaxX: anyway, hi astrobyto
 Astrobytes: lol, awesome. Hiya Zartho
 struct: ban who?
 Astrobytes: me, was trolling Zartho again
 ZarthaxX: structo ban him&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: and hi
 struct: hi
 CodingFart: Hi could anyone give me some tips to solve Stock Exchange Losses please?
 miszu: Hi CodingFart, you need to solve it efficiently and not brute forcing
 miszu: so spend more time understanding how to calculate biggest drop
 miszu: there is a property about this problem that if you find it, it makes it easy to solve it
 CodingFart: Thank you miszu
 jacek: oh my

 Radman_737: what's up&#160;?
 geppoz: eulerscheZahl I'm not going to delete my account for this year&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i hope you mean suspend
 geppoz: no, I mean jokes about "gold or delete", etc done during contest
 geppoz: I did my "1st in country or delete"
 geppoz: then we both said "nintendo or delete" :P
 geppoz: am I right?
 eulerscheZahl: gold sounds boring, make it legend
 LastRick: At codingame, you never quit, jyou ust take extended breaks? (Stolen from Runescape)
 LastRick: *you just
 eulerscheZahl: nintendo :scream:
 Astrobytes: gj on Nintendo geppoz
 geppoz: so your turn now :D
 eulerscheZahl: so delete?&#160;:(
 R4N4R4M4: Hi every body
 Scarfield: TendoBytes
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 geppoz: ty
 Astrobytes: hello
 eulerscheZahl: R4N4R4M4 join #raic2020
 R4N4R4M4: yes I'm in, look forward ;D
 Astrobytes: ScarFendo :P
 R4N4R4M4: I just received this morning this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vtpf0p">https://prnt.sc/vtpf0p</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh there's a channel on here?
 eulerscheZahl: the chat channel
 eulerscheZahl: nice, got mine yesterday
 R4N4R4M4: GG euler&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: ordered tshirt in M and hoodie in L, got both in M
 eulerscheZahl: close enough
 Astrobytes: hey, at least it arrived eventually
 R4N4R4M4: after nearly a year
 Astrobytes: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: even via express delivery
 eulerscheZahl: smits would have been disappointed if he was a winner
 eulerscheZahl: moving homes in just 1 year, bad move
 Scarfield: lol
 R4N4R4M4: My hoodie ils L. I asked +1 for size as you said, and it fits very well :D
 Astrobytes: is this year's RAIC as Halite-y as it looks?
 R4N4R4M4: eulerscheZahl you rewrite pathfind for RAIC&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure
 eulerscheZahl: my current attempt is worse and slow
 R4N4R4M4: not sure too
 R4N4R4M4: Astrobytes, yes RAIC 2020 is nice 
 eulerscheZahl: there are some similarities to halite for sure
 struct: until fog comes
 eulerscheZahl: frog &gt; fog
 Astrobytes: Gonna check it out later tonight or tomorrow, got some spare time
 eulerscheZahl: and the tshirt should be fairly easy if you like merch
 R4N4R4M4: you have a page to see the t-shirt&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm confident i'm already in the tshirt ranks with my pimped starter
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think they published (or even know themselves) how it will look like
 Astrobytes: as long as it's black or black it's cool
 Scarfield: so black is the new black now?
 Astrobytes: And the old.
 Scarfield: I want one only if its in slightly darker black
 eulerscheZahl: my mom's reaction all the time: oh, another black one
 eulerscheZahl: except when i got a while one and she was happy
 Scarfield: and turtleneck of cause
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: darker black? You want a t-shirt containing a gravitational singularity or what? :D

 LastRick: hah
 struct: im not conviced on khet 3d
 Astrobytes: oh Archer, lol
 struct: The tower thing doesnt convice me
 Astrobytes: 2D will still be fine struct
 Astrobytes: the regular version
 struct: I think the tower will just add confusion
 Scarfield: if you are looking for a game to port, i played "Hive Carbon" with a friend recently, and it seemed it could be interesting enough to make a bot for
 Scarfield: the pieces are hexagons :p
 struct: writing the statement is the hard part
 struct: too boring
 Scarfield: just looked up Khet: "Classic strategy, with more PEW PEW" lol
 TimberStalker: how do you enable c# preview features?
 eulerscheZahl: here on CodinGame? you don't
 TimberStalker: it said i can enable language preview features.
 eulerscheZahl: that's the standard help when you type some new command. there is no way for you to activate it on CodinGame
 TimberStalker: oh
 eulerscheZahl: only staff can update language versions
 TimberStalker: because preview c# doesnt need a main function, and that would be really usefull for the short code games
 eulerscheZahl: i know that new c# standard. you have to wait
 eulerscheZahl: last update for C# was in march i think
 eulerscheZahl: using .net core now
 LastRick: can we put in a wish list for our language when it gets updated next? Would love a priorityqueue in Dart. Would make A*, BFS, etc a ton easier.
 Zenoscave: I'd like the same in C#
 LastRick: how are you handling it currently in C#?
 eulerscheZahl: copy-paste a heap from stackoverflow
 eulerscheZahl: would be nice to have one in the language standard that would probably be more speed optimized
 R4N4R4M4: I got question in C++, if someone could help
 R4N4R4M4: Here is my code trying to write the actionInsert() function&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7ea291f-aaeb-4a36-82c6-f9924cd97d1e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7ea291f-aaeb-4a36-82c6-f9924cd97d1e</a>
 R4N4R4M4: The code is working outside the function, but not inside..
 karliso: Why do you mean by "not working"?
 R4N4R4M4: It seems that the unordered_mal stays empty when I use the function
 R4N4R4M4: *map
 RoboStac: you make a copy inside the function and add to that and then immediately destroy it
 R4N4R4M4: oh... I didn't see that
 R4N4R4M4: I thought all were pointers
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/07349bcb-0e2e-4378-9e6a-b38a585159fb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/07349bcb-0e2e-4378-9e6a-b38a585159fb</a>
 R4N4R4M4: Oh, thanks, I tried this *, but forgot the &amp; :D
 R4N4R4M4: Nothig changes, with pointer or reference, the unordered_map  actions.entityActions.size() is 0
 R4N4R4M4: *ng
 struct: the 2nd version that robo sent should be changing
 struct: the action that you pass
 R4N4R4M4: I think I should call the function with &amp;action instead
 struct: yes
 struct: you need too
 karliso: action is already pointer
 karliso: will not compile
 karliso: Also.. this wrapper function just complicates things. you would be better off without it.
 R4N4R4M4: I got it, you're functions are OK, but when I made the copy before calling the function, and then I used the copy ...
 R4N4R4M4: yes karliso you're right
 R4N4R4M4: so the function did well but I worked with a bad copy
 R4N4R4M4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d150794-e6d0-456a-a595-f39bb0c1b852">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d150794-e6d0-456a-a595-f39bb0c1b852</a>

 R4N4R4M4: C++ is tricky... :D
 JBM: tricky is dangerous
 R4N4R4M4: For RAIC, I have all my code in C, but I have to input and ouput with C++ classes , not easy for me :D
 R4N4R4M4: I spent a lot of time on thoses shared_ptr&#160;!!!!
 R4N4R4M4: and unordered_map&lt;T&gt; ;D
 RoboStac: yeah, the raic default code tends to be a bit overcomplicated
 Sakuta: hi
 Sakuta: how long have you guys been coding?
 JBM: too long
 eulerscheZahl: not long enough
 Sakuta: like 1 year or 2 years type quesiton
 JBM: yeah that too
 eulerscheZahl: 10
 Sakuta: bc i mean im trynna learn how too lol
 Sakuta: it seems pretty imtimidating
 JBM: start simple
 Sakuta: like what?
 LastRick: I thought I had been coding a long time (35?). Then I got here and realized I still had a lot to learn.
 JBM: beats me
 Sakuta: what code do you knwo?
 JBM: caesar's
 Sakuta: caesars?
 Astrobytes: I know Da Vinci
 Sakuta: is that even a code?
 Sakuta: wai whaa
 Astrobytes: and the Green Cross
 Sakuta: r u trynna trick me?
 LastRick: COBOL and Fortran
 eulerscheZahl: gray code
 Sakuta: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: or grey?
 Sakuta: i want to learn java javascript and python
 Astrobytes: I think 'gray' is more US spelling
 Sakuta: or maybe just C#
 JBM: isn't named after the fellow?
 struct: Should i let players choose board setups?
 eulerscheZahl: it is. but i don't know how to spell him
 reCurse: For which game
 Astrobytes: Oh right, yeah Gray
 eulerscheZahl: choose between what? render in both pixi and three.js?
 struct: khet reCurse
 reCurse: What's that
 struct: Also known as laser chess
 reCurse: Interesting
 reCurse: Speaking of chess, I'm still thorn on whether to add drop or not. Maybe I'll just add both and see feedback
 reCurse: *torn
 struct: The crazyhouse part?
 reCurse: Yeah
 Astrobytes: drop? crazyhouse
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ah
 Astrobytes: I like the idea tbh
 reCurse: 960 is obviously staying
 struct: well the 960 does well to counter the opening books
 reCurse: Just not sure about drops
 struct: Not sure how AIs do with drops
 struct: if any player has advantage
 reCurse: It has the advantage of destroying any known eval
 reCurse: It has the disadvantage of increasing branching factor by an order of magnitude, I think
 reCurse: Maybe not that much, but still significant
 Astrobytes: would you keep insta-checkmate drops?
 reCurse: Yes
 Astrobytes: I think it would be interesting for sure. Perhaps make both?
 reCurse: Yeah I guess it could work
 reCurse: We have 2 gos after all
 Astrobytes: Yep
 reCurse: Disadvantage of regular chess is I would like to keep a game under 100 moves so I can do mirror match
 reCurse: Without tablebase it can be hard to handle endgame
 reCurse: In crazyhouse there's no endgame
 reCurse: lol
 jacek: use shogi [solved]
 reCurse: The advantage of chess is it will (should?) be popular
 reCurse: As much as I like shogi I doubt most would bother
 Astrobytes: well, there is a hardcore of board game enthusiasts here
 jacek: who
 Astrobytes: where's the &lt;slap jacek&gt; button...
 reCurse: It broke, too much use
 Astrobytes: heh
 jacek: though took me a while to get myself to make proper checkers bot
 jacek: and agad pm me in the forum!
 eulerscheZahl: wow, jacek knows the big fish
 Astrobytes: is that a request or a statement?
 R4N4R4M4: Do we know how many will be in Round 2 in RAIC&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 2 is before the finals?
 R4N4R4M4: yes
 R4N4R4M4: the T-shirt :D
 eulerscheZahl: 300 from round1 + 60 from sandbox
 jacek: crazyhouse960, in other words, antiMSmits chess
 eulerscheZahl: and 50 from round2 + 10 from sandbox =&gt; finals = hoodie
 struct: when does round 1 end?
 eulerscheZahl: 2 weeks
 struct: ok ill just last 2 days
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 360 tshirts to win200 players at the moment
 eulerscheZahl: there will be some more but that's still an easy tshirt
 R4N4R4M4: yes, so we'll try the Hoodie :D
 eulerscheZahl: do i have to fight you again?
 1101110_1110101_1101100_1101100: hmm
 1101110_1110101_1101100_1101100: i am new 
 1101110_1110101_1101100_1101100: some one fight my bot 
 R4N4R4M4: may be
 eulerscheZahl: last time we both qualified for the finals via sandbox iirc
 R4N4R4M4: yes great moment :D
 eulerscheZahl: i was savefor you it was thrilling till the end
 R4N4R4M4: yes it was short
 eulerscheZahl: and then they DQed 1 or 2 players and it wasn't that close after all
 Astrobytes: duplicate code?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: lol, I just never understand what these people hope to achieve :D
 eulerscheZahl: but organizers check it and take action so i'm fine with it :D
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's good to know they check
 jacek: unlike some other sites&#160;:?
 R4N4R4M4: My next version (green) vs my actual version (blue) :D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vtseqj">https://prnt.sc/vtseqj</a>
 Astrobytes: *tiny* improvement :P
 eulerscheZahl: i would be ashamed to wear that cheated tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: chat is laggy again&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's my internet
 jacek: AutomatonNN are you laggy
 AutomatonNN: pretty much all the problems
 MiYazJE: a
 MiYazJE: a
 MiYazJE: a
 MiYazJE: a
 Astrobytes: don't do that MiYazJE
 MiYazJE: I was testing, srry
 Astrobytes: k, no worries
 jacek: testing mods' patience
 Astrobytes: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: ehmmm
 AntiSquid: sorry, just testing if he's still in chat
 Astrobytes: ...
 reCurse: What was that even necessary for
 reCurse: He apologized, no harm, just move on man
 miszu: What happened?
 miszu: after he apologized?
 reCurse: He got kicked
 Astrobytes: not by me
 jacek: nor me
 Astrobytes: beep beep jacek
 miszu: gj guys xD
 eulerscheZahl: you can test if someone is on the chat via autocompletion antisq[tab]
 eulerscheZahl: squiddy is offline
 reCurse: ffs
 Astrobytes: honestly
 jacek: he kicked himself?
 eulerscheZahl: is that possible?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 struct: no
 struct: :D
 miszu: developers 1st world problem
 Astrobytes: you're getting close to a "shut up" jacek :D
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: lol
 miszu: qq about ghost in the cell, using graph search algorithms is not a good idea right? You can have a possibility of 100+ branching factor
 jacek: 100+ branching factor? those are rookie numbers
 Astrobytes: #';
 Astrobytes:  sorry, damn cat
 TiopazHc: I am solving an encryption problem and since I don't speak English I think my translation is failing me
 miszu: TiopazHc usually by looking at highest frequency and associating it to the letter E should be sufficient
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, you should collect scores instead of killing all enemies, lol: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clip2net.com/s/4a3d6zv">https://clip2net.com/s/4a3d6zv</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no, it's the scoring that needs fixing!
 struct: collecting is giving more points?
 eulerscheZahl: collect resources: 1 point per resource
 eulerscheZahl: destroying enemies: 10 times the purchase cost I think
 eulerscheZahl: purchasing something yourself gives you the cost of it as score too

 dbf: (not sure if it is synced with yesterday balance update)
 eulerscheZahl: 30HP for resource, looks good
 dbf: I've added repair of buildings during the game, but you destroyed them faster than I was able to repair&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: my bot is just spamming units
 eulerscheZahl: and blocking the own path with houses
 dbf: ok, looks like your spam rate is better than mine
 SkyleDc: Hello, i'm kind of a newbie to C++, i'm coding a bot in Coders Strike Back and i'm currently bronze. I don't know what to do to counter collisions&#160;:(
 dbf: what do you mean by 'counter collisions'?
 SkyleDc: I mean, you know, pods are colliding and like, i kind of always get second because of that
 SkyleDc: I don't really know what to do to rise in the leaderboard and some hints would help me a lot&#160;!
 jacek: do you use boost
 Astrobytes: You can pretty much ignore collisions for now tbh
 SkyleDc: I do&#160;!
 SkyleDc: Well, i'm not that good in maths and all so i don't know how to optimize my speed and my turns
 struct: Store the checkpoints
 struct: and start turning to them when you are close to the current check point
 Astrobytes: :point_up:
 SkyleDc: Well, i did a code which make the pod slow down when the distance of the next checkpoint is like &lt; 1500 and all
 SkyleDc: Wdym by "store the checkpoints" please&#160;?
 struct: after the first lap you will know all the checkpoints positions
 SkyleDc: Oh really&#160;?
 SkyleDc: Let me take a look ..
 Astrobytes: well, you pass through them&#160;;)
 SkyleDc: Oh, after the first lap&#160;! (I didn't understand sorry &gt;.&lt;) I'm a french guy so ... eheh
 Astrobytes: all good, don't worry
 SkyleDc: So, how can i proceed to store checkpoints&#160;?
 SkyleDc: Like ...
 SkyleDc: I kinda know how to check if the next checkpoint has already been seen but ...
 struct: with an array maybe
 SkyleDc: Oh.
 SkyleDc: Thanks ahah
 SkyleDc: Say no more :p
 SkyleDc: love you &lt;3
 Astrobytes: do you get velocity in Bronze?
 SkyleDc: Wdym&#160;?
 Astrobytes: in your input
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: right
 SkyleDc: I do only get boost, thrust ajnd collisions
 wlesavo: yeah you have to come up with velocity before yopu do -3vel
 SkyleDc: No, no velocity
 eulerscheZahl: i hate CSB inconsistency in inputs
 SkyleDc: Let's get to work on these arrays :p
 Astrobytes: Yeah, so calculate your velocity, store your checkpoints, adjust your numbers and go to gold&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's not helpful eulerscheZahl, especially since that's the 'tutorial' multi
 SkyleDc: Calculate velocity&#160;? O.o
 SkyleDc: I'm not at that poit yet ahah
 SkyleDc: point*
 miszu: it's just delta X
 miszu: delta y / delta x
 jacek: calculus :scream:
 ToshiTuringMachine: check atan2 cos and sin on the angle converted to radians... 
 Ajanx112: does using a minifier count as cheating in the shortest mode :d
 doomcoder: i have done to activities so far (including the tutorial)
 doomcoder: i am also a newbie
 Drakkhonian: dammit
 Sergen: best CoC questions: actual puzzles, worst: copy this formula that I learnt in my physics class
 Drakkhonian: i accidentally turned off the stabilizer that my pc is connected in with my foot
 Drakkhonian: and lost this entire afternoon of coding
 SkyleDc: Ok so i did a vector of int vector called checkpoints and a vector of int called biais. Biais contains the x and y pos of the next cp. Then it checks if it is not already set. If not it pushes back biais in checkpoint. Here, everything fine i think ...
 jacek: did you go up in the leaderboard?
 SkyleDc: I didn't. I did not implement the code to turn a bit before the actual checkpoint
 SkyleDc: I do not know how to do that
 SkyleDc: Like, what if it fails&#160;?
 SkyleDc: What if the pod just doesn't take the actual cp and just go to the next one&#160;?
 SkyleDc: thinking it did*
 SkyleDc: how can i debug vars&#160;? Like just printing a var without it being interpreted as an instruction&#160;?
 SkyleDc: I can't get to do it
 jacek: print to stderr
 struct: There should be an example on how to do it in the comments
 SkyleDc: i did cerr &lt;&lt; "test" &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: that should work
 jacek: it should work

 SkyleDc: well, it's long ...
 miszu: it will auto  format
 jacek: thats what she said
 SkyleDc: Like, i may need to paste all of the code
 SkyleDc: i may have made a mistake
 SkyleDc: somewhere
 jacek: paste few lines before and few lines after the cerr
 miszu: it will create a pstebin link
 SkyleDc: I'll create a pastebin, it will be easier for me
 jacek: welp
 SkyleDc: I've DMed you, struct
 jacek: you can share it here freely
 SkyleDc: None shall cheat kappa
 jacek: oO
 struct:  cout &lt;&lt; nextCheckpointX &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; nextCheckpointY &lt;&lt; arg_puiss &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: you need a space after nextCheckpointY
 SkyleDc: Nono, this is working, don't worry
 struct: ah right
 struct: let me see again
 SkyleDc: arg_puiss is a string which take either " BOOST" or " x"
 SkyleDc: where x is a number between 1 and 100
 struct: so only this line is broken?
 struct:  cerr &lt;&lt; checkpoints[0][0] &lt;&lt; checkpoints[0][1] &lt;&lt; endl;
 SkyleDc: 0 ans 100
 SkyleDc: Yes.
 jacek: is  checkpoints already initialized then?
 struct: yes, your 2d vector is not right

 SkyleDc: How's that&#160;! :O
 struct: in this part
 struct: you are pushing back a vector
 SkyleDc: Is it bad&#160;?
 SkyleDc: I think it's ok&#160;?
 Astrobytes: vectors of vectors or...
 struct: maybe it is
 SkyleDc: I mean, i got some exemples and it does that
 jacek: still doesnt explain why cerr doesnt work
 SkyleDc: Hmmm
 struct: oh
 Astrobytes: where's teh code?
 struct: ofc it doesnt
 Astrobytes: the
 struct: for(int i = 0; i&lt;checkpoints.size();i++)
 struct: checkpoints start at size 0
 struct: it will never store it
 SkyleDc: Oh ...
 SkyleDc: &lt;=
 SkyleDc: that's it, i think
 Astrobytes: heh, you want num checkpoints
 SkyleDc: lemme fix that&#160;!
 SkyleDc: Hmmm...
 SkyleDc: did change i&lt;checkpoints.size() to i&lt;=checkpoints.size()
 SkyleDc: but not working ...
 Astrobytes: No. You need the number of checkpoints. Not the size of your checkpoint vector before you populate it.
 SkyleDc: Imma send you the code, wait
 SkyleDc: You'll understand
 Astrobytes: you can post here, it's OK
 Astrobytes: we've all done it
 SkyleDc: Just wanted to keep it secret but ok
 SkyleDc: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/4VFMxuj8">https://pastebin.com/4VFMxuj8</a>
 SkyleDc: lul
 SkyleDc: I'm the mystery man
 SkyleDc: It does take the next cp pos and push it into biais
 SkyleDc: Then it pushes biais into checkpoints
 SkyleDc: If the cp pos already exist in checkpoint, it will just stop pushing biais into checkpoint
 Astrobytes: OK, that's not gonna work. May I suggest creating a struct with an x and y variables
 SkyleDc: oh f...
 SkyleDc: xD
 SkyleDc: You know, i do LOVE weak absurd code ...
 SkyleDc:&#160;:')
 SkyleDc: (Ok, i may hate structures ...)
 struct: use class
 SkyleDc: I may hate classes too ... Well i do hate theml less than structs but ...
 jacek: struct doesnt like structs
 ToshiTuringMachine: use tuples
 SkyleDc: WTH even is tuples&#160;?
 SkyleDc: ahah
 jacek: pair
 SkyleDc: i'm kind of a c++ newbie
 Astrobytes: I'm having a short break, afk for 5 mins
 SkyleDc: Ok ^^
 ToshiTuringMachine: tuple&lt;int,int&gt; checkpoints [24]
 ToshiTuringMachine: get&lt;0&gt;(checkpoints[i]), get&lt;1&gt;(checkpoints[i])
 ToshiTuringMachine: make_tuple(a,b)
 SkyleDc: hum ...
 ToshiTuringMachine: some bad guys saved the coords as a single double
 ToshiTuringMachine: using fractional parts to store y
 SkyleDc: can i cerr 2 times&#160;?
 ToshiTuringMachine: why not
 Astrobytes: yes
 SkyleDc: I mean, i'm trying but i can't get it to work
 Astrobytes: cerr as many times as you like
 SkyleDc:  cerr &lt;&lt; biais[0] &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; biais[0] &lt;&lt; " ";........cerr &lt;&lt; biais[0] &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; biais[0] &lt;&lt; endl; doesnt work
 SkyleDc: My output is just one line
 SkyleDc: &gt; 7192 7192 
 ToshiTuringMachine: you need a endl in the middle
 ToshiTuringMachine: or write 2 cerr commands
 SkyleDc: i did both
 ToshiTuringMachine: cerr&lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl; cerr &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; endl;
 SkyleDc: Lemme try
 SkyleDc: Nope
 SkyleDc: &gt; 5001
 SkyleDc: Only one line
 SkyleDc: Nvm, 2 lines out of 4
 SkyleDc: still miss 2 lines
 SkyleDc: mhhhhhhh nvm
 ToshiTuringMachine: was it on the next turn?
 SkyleDc: Nope, seems some code is breaking everything
 SkyleDc: made it a comment and it now works
 SkyleDc: tryna figure why
 Astrobytes: look, putting your x and y coords one after the other into vector&lt;int&gt; biais - what does that accomplish?
 SkyleDc: Well, how do i know how many checkpoints there is&#160;?
 SkyleDc: i do not have any "checkpoint_number" var
 SkyleDc: checkpoint_count*
 SkyleDc: Well, technically, the code should work, i just tested in a simple c++ command line program
 SkyleDc: But it seems the IDE doesn't support it
 Astrobytes: how can for(int i = 0; i&lt;=checkpoints.size();i++) work if you don't know how many checkpoints you have?
 khanghugo: count how many checkpoints you have first
 Astrobytes: and don't store the x and y coordinates one after the other in a vector
 SkyleDc: it iterates the checkpoints vector to see if biais[0] (nextCPXpos) OR biais[1] (ypos) already exists
 Astrobytes: They describe a point in the space, x and y coordinate
 SkyleDc: if it exists, then the checkpoint is already set and then the checkpoints.size will be the number of checkpoints on the map
 Astrobytes: no, because checkpoints.size() is 0
 SkyleDc: so it iterates through checkpoints[0][0] and checkpoints[0][1] only
 Astrobytes: also, checkpoints is a vector of vectors
 SkyleDc: i mean, checkpoints[i][0/1]
 SkyleDc: as the for iterates from i to 0 or less (checkpoints.size()) it gets through checkpoints[0][0] and checkpoints[0][1]
 SkyleDc: which is set just before (push_back(biais))
 SkyleDc: so the final checkpoints vector should look like, for exemple,  checkpoints = { {1000, 2000}, {2000, 5000}}
 SkyleDc: or, if you prefer, array() [0=&gt; array() [0=&gt; x pos, 1=&gt; ypos]]
 SkyleDc: ans so on
 SkyleDc: and*
 SkyleDc: How can i send you a screenshot&#160;?
 SkyleDc: imgur&#160;?
 SkyleDc: I've sent you a dm
 SkyleDc: There were no error with the .size() btw, the size() of a vector actually returns an integer which starts at 1
 SkyleDc: (i dunno how to say it ...)
 SkyleDc: So i was right &gt;.&lt;

 Scarfield: -90 is probably the angle, you are reading the input in wrong order or assigning it wrong i guess
 ExileDaniel: I figured. The code by default provided wrong input order
 jacek: oO
 ExileDaniel: This is the default for me cin &gt;&gt; X &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; HS &gt;&gt; VS &gt;&gt; F &gt;&gt; R &gt;&gt; P; cin.ignore();
 ExileDaniel: This is the true one cin &gt;&gt; R &gt;&gt; P &gt;&gt; X &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; HS &gt;&gt; VS &gt;&gt; F; cin.ignore();
 Scarfield: the default code is not wrong on this puzzle, thousands has done it before with no issues. Are you reading all the surface points before the while loop?

 TiopazHc: Any clues&#160;?? https: //www.codingame.com/training/hard/her-majestys-well-shared-secret
 Uljahn: besides those on the forum? no, sorry
 TiopazHc: ya ps sin miedo al exito :v
 bezunyl: Are the servers slow right now?
 catalactics: is it just me or is it so slow
 bezunyl: I'm glad it's not just me lol
 ClockSort: slow it is.
 bezunyl: It appears someone wrote bad code.
 bezunyl: Too much for the website to handle.
 catalactics: that couldn't happen, bc they have protection against infinite loop
 catalactics: and other unsanitized code
 jzen: Could be a flaw
 bezunyl: I forgot to indicate sarcasm, sorry.
 catalactics: I can bet the server room is prob like really hot.
 isaiahtaylor: running my test cases is super slow and I keep getting verification timeout
 isaiahtaylor: &gt;not hosting on an autoscaling k8s sytem
 catalactics:  just don't join any clash of code match 
 Recovery_disaster: its the same every day at about 01:20 a.m. GMT+1
 catalactics: TRUE
 catalactics: i think they just have a maintenance?
 Recovery_disaster: I think they calculate the new ranks
 catalactics: maybe they're just clearing their cache
 catalactics: for clash of code
 catalactics: bc they keep those code results for a long time
 catalactics: is it back?
 isaiahtaylor: taking like 30 secs each run
 isaiahtaylor: whoever can code without checking first wins lol
 catalactics: true
 isaiahtaylor: hovering over player profiles triggers loading bar haha
 Project-Magenta: everything is slow
 isaiahtaylor: seems to be speeding up now
 miszu: speed kills
 miszu: *miszu bein thrown out of window*
 ToshiTuringMachine: js kills
 ToshiTuringMachine: *Toshi gets isolated by dev community
 ToshiTuringMachine: illedan are you here? i want to thank you for the Search Race puzzle and curse you because i am stuck at last test failed...
 ToshiTuringMachine: this website is perfect to learn a new language when you come from another. learning c++ now
 CoolCheerio: hello is anyone here
 AYB: hello world
 Toastytoast14: print('Hello World')
 AYB: Console.WriteLine("Hello World")
 AYB: Console.log("Hello world")

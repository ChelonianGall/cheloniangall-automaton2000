 Westicles: 84% chance the author starts with W
 lcuas: sexo caralho
 jacek: Wonto...?
 Thyl: Hi&#160;!:
 halimzzz: heey

 netimu: hello everyone, quite new to this. How does it go?
 derjack: hello
 swagger.alex: hi
 Wontonimo: for those who are new here, there is more than just Clash.  There are puzzles (without a timer) that you can solve at your own pace.  HEre is an eas yone to start <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 Schwase: got 5th in CG Funge Prime, probably took me a solid week to get my first 100% that was in contention. Might go for top of the leaderboard but happy with 6th for now
 Westicles: did you do it manually or coded something?
 jwpihlgren: os
 Wontonimo: can anyone suggest a webGPU tutorial that they have liked?
 cooltree: hi
 cooltree: im zxc01
 EggKim: webgl2fundamentals.org is pretty good
 EggKim: if you want to make something fancy, maybe some of Inigo Quillez's raymarching tutorials could help too
 EggKim: @Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: thanks
 Wontonimo: That a good link.  I'm look for more for compute instead of rendering.  Like using the gpu for simulation calculation
 Thorcode: I think clash in here is good too
 EggKim: WebGL unfortunately doesn't have compute shaders yet, but webgl2fundamentals has an article on GPGPU... that's really the closest I think you could get
 EggKim: @Wontonimo
 C26_1: I've wonder if we can make a game using object
 C26_1: And those object has a function exchange the information together
 C26_1: sadly
 C26_1: A lot of programmer hate OOP
 TechWithTim.py: ik
 TechWithTim.py: fuck classes
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: Respect @TechWithTim.py
 TechWithTim.py:&#160;?
 TechWithTim.py: ez
 TechWithTim.py: codingame is pretty ez
 TechWithTim.py: you guys should try google kickstart
 C26_1: holýhit
 C26_1: no way
 TechWithTim.py: yes
 C26_1: Codinggame is hard as hell
 TechWithTim.py: kickstart isnt hard 
 TechWithTim.py: Sarcasm?
 C26_1: No
 TechWithTim.py: Just practice
 C26_1: Ok
 TechWithTim.py: how long ypu've been coding
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: I just coding for fun
 C26_1: You kno
 TechWithTim.py: how long?
 C26_1: hobbyist
 xangeliczx: i started 2 days ago lol
 C26_1: And I noticed
 TechWithTim.py: startest coding 2 days ago?
 xangeliczx: yes
 C26_1: That coding can make me help other people
 TechWithTim.py: ye
 TechWithTim.py: ive been coding for a few months
 TechWithTim.py: to a year\
 xangeliczx: wow
 C26_1: ươ
 C26_1: wow
 C26_1: Coding for real?
 C26_1: RESPECT +1
 xangeliczx: lol
 Thorcode: bruh
 xangeliczx:&#160;?
 Thorcode: bruh kickstart is not really hard
 Thorcode: TechWithTim.py shall we solo
 TechWithTim.py: ye
 TechWithTim.py: im 13 too btw
 Thorcode: ok
 C26_1: Oh
 C26_1: I'm 13 tô
 C26_1: I'm 13 too
 Thorcode: ok
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: I have challange CoC with @TechWithTim.py at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/209120650c63cb78a1086c47f76c4b9a17d2194">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/209120650c63cb78a1086c47f76c4b9a17d2194</a>
 C26_1: So cool
 TechWithTim.py: ok
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: @TechWithTim.py
 C26_1: Can I say something to you
 TechWithTim.py: wat
 C26_1: Does cryptography has already something called string and string_key?
 C26_1: A string_key is a string to make a password to protect the string?
 C26_1: This is my contribution link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7686bf48766109a9439251e59ec5010f57e3">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7686bf48766109a9439251e59ec5010f57e3</a>
 C26_1: My contribution has been downvoted a lot becuase the output is something ridiculously large
 C26_1: And most programming language have only integer type um to 2^64-1
 C26_1: SO yea my contribution should be downvoted anyway
 C26_1: I love python
 C26_1: Becuase of its infinite integer type
 C26_1: Most programming language suck at that and I very hated at that point. But only that point
 C26_1: Like Javascript
 C26_1: That is the most flexible programming language ever
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: Can I ask something more?
 Thorcode: 1*27^3 + 2*27^2 + 3*27^1 + 4*27^0
 Thorcode: hey are you serious
 C26_1: No
 C26_1: I'm not serious
 C26_1: That's the formula anyway
 C26_1: To make a password
 Thorcode: that's too big
 C26_1: yea
 Thorcode: bruh max is 11^2
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: I'm wrong
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: No problem
 Thorcode: I was think it is factorial
 C26_1: I have HTML file, CSS file, SQL file, PHP file to connect HTML, JavaScript and SQL together
 C26_1: How to make a website?
 C26_1: Like a website that have input form
 C26_1: And you submit them and then something else appear
 C26_1: HTML file: skeletonCSS file: The skinSQL file: The infomation that are collected and storedPHP: The muscle
 C26_1: JavaScript: The functional
 Husoski: You need a web server and an SQL server.  If you don't already have those, one good choice is XAMPP.  No doubt others have their favorites.  Learn how to set up a basic web site, then add features one at a time.
 Husoski: XAMPP is a bundle of an Apache web server, a MySQL compatible database server, plus current version of PHP and Perl.  Versions are available for Linux, Windows and MacOS last I looked.

 Mbeits: am failing test 4 and 5 any clues
 Uljahn: оО
 ChampionCoder: Can you guys give your feedback:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6077df7d033fc5a77c16113f2a19f0512451">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6077df7d033fc5a77c16113f2a19f0512451</a>
 Westicles: Everybody else is finished while I google tokenize for c++ for the millionth time
 Megha.Akash: Nice one ChampionCoder. I think I have similar puzzle here. I may be wrong. Could you please verify the above statement? If not, I'd be happy to approve. I have tested it it the IDE and can be solved with just a dict and a single line of regex. 
 SwagColoredKitteh: hey o/
 SwagColoredKitteh: Uljahn cute kitty
 SwagColoredKitteh: ChampionCoder i think it would be nicer if it gave all of the emojis first, then the string
 SwagColoredKitteh: so you don't have to hard-code the emoji
 ChampionCoder: No I designed it such that only 5 emojis shall be there
 ChampionCoder: So no prolem
 ChampionCoder: But thanks anyways
 SwagColoredKitteh: sure
 Uljahn: hi Swaggie, btw that contrib lacks  :hugging: emoji i guess
 jacek: or :cat:
 Uljahn: :cat: :hugging: :popcorn:
 SwagColoredKitteh: :hugging:
 jacek: :expressionless:
 SelimEmin: why if else not workin
 Arunas29: try elseif 
 SelimEmin: in javascript
 NoiselessBrocolli_c9f0: fantastic
 NapSter: hey all
 jacek: darn. it works, but why?
 jacek: more and more software developments becomes blackbox
 Kitkat260: morning
 SwagColoredKitteh: hey o/
 bbblash: i am not a bot
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: oh 
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: sup guys
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: Did any of you guys found that hard i dont get it
 Uljahn: almost everything is hard for a complete newb, just spend 10k hours on learning and you'll be good&#160;:)
 LordDavvytheProgrammer:&#160;:(
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: sure
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: does anyone know what endif is in c#
 struct: you mean #endif?
 kralys: hello

 Automaton2000: if you are going to do it then
 dawidePl: wtf
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: ok i need help for this put my brain cant understand this for some reason im using C#

 VizGhar: this is called spam ^^&#160;:)
 struct: LordDavvytheProgrammer what is the question?
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: A simple algorithm that uses the angle is the following:

 indiehjaerta: Clash of code is so much fun when people finish them in 20s everytime
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: im still new
 LordDavvytheProgrammer:&#160;:(
 struct: There is no endif in C#
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: This is not taking 20s
 struct: #endif is a different thing
 struct: to end a  if in C#
 struct: you just close }
 struct: like if(true) {}
 LordDavvytheProgrammer: ok
 struct: also int x + y thrust will return a error
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud pinged teachers and forgot about RamDeath :scream:
 struct: you should learn C# syntax before you try multiplayers IMO
 MSmits: did he ping me?
 jacek: ramDeath?
 struct: yes MSmits
 struct: on forum
 Astrobytes: check the forum

 MSmits: o, ok
 eulerscheZahl: you got pinged, check your emails
 MSmits: oh this was less than half an hour ago
 MSmits: i did get the mail
 eulerscheZahl: and emails have 15min delay
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I'm not sure what to say though. My problem is that most of my students aren't good enough coders. Maybe 10-20% of the highest class
 struct: MSmits still a solved game might be good for them right?
 VizGhar: Yeah they are straight up dumb :D
 MSmits: no, i am talking about basic programming
 MSmits: reading input and output and heuristics
 MSmits: most cannot do that without great effort
 VizGhar: They need to have tutorial they can copy paste everything from&#160;:)
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: not the dumb part, but the second part :P
 MSmits: I have a lastyear project which determines  a large portion of their grade. the project is about AI
 MSmits: they have the option of writing a CG bot
 struct: how many classes do they get per week MSmits?
 MSmits: or designing a website about a topic in AI
 VizGhar: Yeah. I like to take things to extremes.
 MSmits: they have 2 hrs a week
 MSmits: 8 weeks left for this project
 VizGhar: mine got 2hrs as well
 MSmits: they are expected to spend some time at home
 struct: ah, cant ask for much I guess
 MSmits: but not too much
 MSmits: I have two students that are working on game of drones at least
 MSmits: in bronze now
 MSmits: not sure if any others will try a multi
 MSmits: they have to keep a log of all the things they tried to advance and write a report as well
 VizGhar: only thing I can imagine is to have like 30wood leagues that goes like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/136de4d6-86c2-4012-885e-d2d2db3645a1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/136de4d6-86c2-4012-885e-d2d2db3645a1</a>
 VizGhar: aw... endline&#160;:)
 VizGhar: they simply cannot even take linear curve time/knowledge
 MSmits: yeah that sort of thing helps, but i wonder if there should not just be a really step by step tutorial for some basic languages. I dont mean that puzzle everyone solves to get in
 MSmits: just more explanation of output and input, mostly
 VizGhar: there are many tutorials, but i don't know about any that you can visually see your work on
 MSmits: the auto-generated code for reading input in python is horrible
 VizGhar: my students are learning C++ and the C++ stubs are good here&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah they are fine
 MSmits: C# also
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong with Python starter code?
 MSmits: lemme find an example
 VizGhar: Hmm I can't unlike post in forum? :O
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure you can
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: I guess it's this: inputs = input().split()
 MSmits: it's confusing for newbies
 jacek: meh
 reCurse: What would you recommend
 VizGhar: Hmm I can yours... but not OPs? something strange there...
 MSmits: you're reading input and immediately splitting
 MSmits: and creating an array
 RoboStac: pretty sure you can only unlike for a short time (similar to editing / deleting without it being visible)
 VizGhar: reCurse everything on separate line&#160;:)
 Saaalikh: send room link
 MSmits: because python doesnt show the type, they dont even know that the input is a list
 MSmits: "inputs" i mean
 eulerscheZahl: that inability to unlike is a strange feature
 reCurse: I'm no teacher but python sounds terrible to learn
 MSmits: I guess i would split that line up into two parts
 VizGhar: RoboStac didn't know about that
 MSmits: in a way it is reCurse
 MSmits: there are pros and cons
 eulerscheZahl: i will always recommend a strongly typed language to get started
 reCurse: Can you even iteratively read a stream in python?
 Saaalikh: what are you even talking about??
 eulerscheZahl: and compiled over interpreted
 MSmits: you can do this:
 MSmits: inputstring = input()
 MSmits: then inputlist = inputstring.split()
 MSmits: or something
 reCurse: Oh so it's not the split but the chaining that's the problem
 VizGhar: I don't like python for learning either... I want to explain students how exactly data are stored in memory
 Saaalikh: you can read iterative inputs in python
 MSmits: yes reCurse
 reCurse: Ok
 eulerscheZahl: while it might (not even sure) be easier to understand for beginners, it adds lots of clutter
 MSmits: correct eulerscheZahl, i am not saying there's an easy solution
 reCurse: It already irritates me to no end not to know what a variable is, so I can only imagine for a student
 Saaalikh: k = map(int, input().split())
 reCurse: That's not iterative
 reCurse: And not a stream
 MSmits: and even more confusing&#160;:)
 reCurse: std::cin &gt;&gt; number; is
 eulerscheZahl: and then there's Illedan using "var" for everything including the int type in a for-loop
 MSmits: he sure likes var
 reCurse: var is fine because you have an IDE to tell you the type
 reCurse: At least it's possible to statically determine
 eulerscheZahl: it was introduced for anonymous types. and I keep it for those. But yeah, the IDE can help when you hover over it
 MSmits: I use auto in c++ for those time variables
 reCurse: var list = new List&lt;string&gt;()&#160;?
 VizGhar: I declare WAR!!!
 MSmits: other than that i never use auto or var
 reCurse: Or List&lt;string&gt; list = new List&lt;string&gt;()
 reCurse: Should be a no brainer
 jacek: kotlin ftw
 eulerscheZahl: personally I don't use var here but I'm fine with it in that context
 MSmits: yeah good point reCurse, it's just not in my system to use it
 eulerscheZahl: var list = otherList;that again gets a little less readable
 reCurse: It's extremely useful to cut a lot useless clutter
 reCurse: Readability to a point
 reCurse: Too much clutter also hinders readability
 reCurse: It's not so much about hiding types from code as not being able to determine it at all like python
 eulerscheZahl: i just prefer to have the type at the beginning of the line
 MSmits: reCurse i did a bitboard in python once :P
 eulerscheZahl: still: var is much better than whatever python does
 reCurse: :door:
 MSmits: so much pain&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: next level obfuscation: spamming dynamic on C#
 MSmits: board = 0 .... uh, 0 what?
 VizGhar: reCurse - knock knock :D
 reCurse: It's a one way exit door
 reCurse: No knocking
 eulerscheZahl: i'd also like to publicly shame Smits for not using generic Lists&#160;;)
 MSmits: like collection?
 MSmits: or what is it again?
 eulerscheZahl: once you said you use List instead of List&lt;T&gt;
 MSmits: oh right
 VizGhar: I shame MSmits for not knowing what List is :D
 MSmits: the T thing
 reCurse: ...
 MSmits: everything is specific with me
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't the casting annoy you?
 reCurse: That should warrant a walk naked in the streets of CG
 eulerscheZahl: and the killer argument: performance!
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl maybe it would if I was more aware of the alternative
 eulerscheZahl: List needs boxing and unboxing, which makes it slower than the generic counterpart
 reCurse: Only for basic types
 MSmits: i switched to C++ before I was really getting into that stuff
 VizGhar: ++
 MSmits: and then i learned python
 MSmits: onyl sometimes do i still use C#
 VizGhar: Autoboxing is only thing for primitives
 MSmits: mostly for meta mcts /windows forms
 reCurse: Value types to be more semantic
 eulerscheZahl: right
 MSmits: btw, if i want performance i dont use list
 MSmits: i use arrays with predetermined size
 reCurse: Does that even make a difference
 reCurse: List is backed by array no?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, list is a wrapper
 MSmits: if you set a capacity when you create it, it may not matter
 MSmits: but if you dont set a list capacity, you have a performance issue
 eulerscheZahl: i even read the LIst code once because I was curious
 reCurse: Sure, but that's true for any dynamically allocated array
 reCurse: No case for arrays
 eulerscheZahl: you could use unsafe for your arrays if it's really about performance
 reCurse: That's the answer I was looking for
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: if i really care about performance i use C++ anyway
 eulerscheZahl: you won this round
 reCurse: The real answer
 MSmits: so you're right, generics are a good thing to learn for me
 MSmits: if i need to use C#
 MSmits: i did use them once or twice with borrowed code i guess
 eulerscheZahl: the real reason for generics: less runtime exceptions and more compile time errors
 MSmits: thats the reason for C# over C++ in general
 VizGhar: One of my student asked me why their HashSet (Java) is sorted... Try to answer this one&#160;:)
 reCurse: Easier syntax, more performance (no casting)
 reCurse: They are deprecated for a reason
 eulerscheZahl: it's sorted for real? or is that a trick question?
 reCurse: Because the hash was weak
 VizGhar: heh sry HashSet of integers
 eulerscheZahl: I know that TreeMap is sorted
 VizGhar: and values were below 10&#160;:)
 MSmits: dont know what hashfunction is used for this
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of an interesting snippet that SaiksyApo shared
 MSmits: my hashfunctions would not leave this sorted
 reCurse: It's java so probably something dumb
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/NGWt4O6">https://tech.io/snippet/NGWt4O6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: what does that code print?
 reCurse: Ah yes the number interning
 MSmits: funny
 reCurse: We finally see what's actually in common between java and javascript
 reCurse: Complete nonsense
 MSmits: I dont understand this Integer thing anyway
 reCurse: It interns integers below 128
 reCurse: Same way strings get interned
 reCurse: For performance
 eulerscheZahl: these are new objects and == checks the address =&gt; different
 reCurse: Instead of you know, having something sensed like value types
 VizGhar: HashSet uses HashMap of size 16 under the hood...&#160;:)
 reCurse: And implicit boxing
 MSmits: oh so &lt;128 = value type &gt;= 128 is reference type?
 reCurse: No value type in java
 reCurse: But the compiler points to an integer[128] object array
 MSmits: argh
 reCurse: So their ref is equal
 MSmits: poor design
 reCurse: Java
 VizGhar: yeah Java&#160;:| If I need to know what is happening I'm not using it
 reCurse: A rare language to make me prefer python
 MSmits: i really like the value type stuff in C#. Makes you able to get nearer to the low level coding of C++ without giving up the easier coding
 VizGhar: :D 
 reCurse: Low level of coding is more like ref value types
 MSmits: when i first converted my C# uttt bot to C++ it was a breeze because of this
 reCurse: Might just make fixed code obsolete
 reCurse: Who knows
 MSmits: i doubt it would have been that easy with java
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because you wrote C# as if it was C++ already?
 MSmits: yeah. Thats part of it
 MSmits: but could I have done this in java?
 MSmits: if it doesnt even have a value int
 reCurse: It has .equals
 VizGhar: do what?
 MSmits: yay
 MSmits: VizGhar code a C# bot that is almost like a C++ bot
 MSmits: with mostly bitboards/bitops
 eulerscheZahl: C# got some low level stuff like Popcount recently
 MSmits: i saw that
 MSmits: didnt it get the whole bmi2?
 VizGhar: I was really frustrated with Kotlin support for bitwise operations&#160;:(
 MSmits: i had to convert my yavalath bot to C# for study project and i saw that stuff was available
 MSmits: however, in unity,the C# code gets "compiled" to javascript
 jacek: kotlin bit operations, aww
 MSmits: for webgl
 MSmits: so i did not trust the intrinsics
 VizGhar: you are using `shl` instead of `&lt;&lt;`; `and` instead of `&amp;`... it's just garbage
 MSmits: argh
 jacek: at least its verbose *&gt;*
 reCurse: To be honest I'd rather deal with intrinsics than magic operators
 VizGhar: NOOO KOTLIN IS CONCISE!!! :D And I'm pretty sad of lack of ternary operator as well
 reCurse: So I'd actually argue in favor
 jacek: at least we got elvis&#160;?:
 VizGhar: true... Ok so see ya wednesday... Got work to do&#160;:(
 MSmits: gotta go for a bit as well, to the store
 philRG: Python gives the wrong feeling that you can code like you speak, without effort, but with the difference that it is difficult to read you back&#160;:-D
 MSmits: thats it. It's both the reason it's a good language to learn coding in and a bad language to learn coding in
 philRG: :joy:
 Flashback813: Hi so I'm pretty new to this and I'm trying to figure out that ghost in the cell game but can't figure out how to test if you own one of the factories. Can anybody help?
 DomiKo: look in "Game Input"
 DomiKo: "If entityType equals FACTORY then the arguments are:"
 DomiKo: "arg1: player that owns the factory: 1 for you, -1 for your opponent and 0 if neutral"
 Flashback813: I saw that but I can't figure how the argument and entity types work
 Flashback813: also I just saw the forums button so I'll see if anything there helps
 philRG: that is the coolest part of the game: discover the game mechanism. Just take time to read the rules, the turn by turn feature, inputs/outputs , and different screens and features of the IDE
 jacek: who reads the rules nowadays
 philRG: one of coolest part
 philRG:&#160;:-(
 philRG: and create strategies also
 Flashback813: well I did read the rules and didn't find the answer but I found a video of someone using this and figured out my issue
 philRG: cool&#160;:-)
 Flashback813: I didn't know it had to be .equals() and I was doing ==
 Flashback813: and coding in the wrong spot
 jacek: java?
 Flashback813: Yes
 Angecide: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to use immintrin.h (c++) in codingames. Whenever I use a function, I get "error: inlining failed in call to always_inline". I read I need to add a compiler flag, but can this be done in codingames?
 Angecide: more specifically, I wanna use the pext instruction 
 reCurse: It's possible but you need to use #pragma to enable the instruction set
 Angecide: how can I do this?
 reCurse: #pragma GCC target "avx2,bmi2"
 Angecide: ahhh
 Angecide: I will try
 Angecide: yep that's it, thanks a lot
 reCurse:&#160;:+1:
 Angecide: also ur new uttt bot is sick
 reCurse: Thanks
 jacek: Angecide you dont use optimized pragmas? :scream:
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops", "omit-frame-pointer", "inline")
 reCurse: Optimize and instruction set is 2 different things
 Angecide: I only got all the optimizers but none of the options or target
 reCurse: Also I'm fairly sure omit-frame-pointer is useless in x64
 jacek: just mindlessly copy pasted fragments of code. as always
 Sakshi_Jain: quick survey guys: is application development better in java or python?
 reCurse: Answering with that generic of a question is a mistake to me
 jacek: jython
 Sakshi_Jain: well I currently do application development in java using springboot and microservices
 Sakshi_Jain: but I enjoy coding in python more 
 Sakshi_Jain: so I was wondering if it'd be aa good idea to switch 
 reCurse: If it's for professional purposes, I'd say switching on a basis of enjoyment is a sure way to waste a lot of money.
 reCurse: Or getting fired in the worst case.
 Sakshi_Jain: hahaha, well I work in an MNC so I'm sure they won't fire me over something like that
 unknownbeast: hey ya'all
 reCurse: So wasting tons of money and time is fine?
 reCurse: If so then go ahead
 Sakshi_Jain: I'll be learning on my own and not using company resources
 unknownbeast: can i get some game ideas
 reCurse: Then do what you heart desires
 Sakshi_Jain: and I'll do the learning in my non working hours
 unknownbeast: i only know c++ till nested loops
 Sakshi_Jain: I just wanted to know if practically is it a good idea, if it has enough scope or not
 reCurse: Not sure I understand the question
 Sakshi_Jain: I don't wanna put in all this effort and then not be able to use it anywhere
 jacek: python in server side? like django?
 Sakshi_Jain: yes
 reCurse: Oh, well I guess it depends on what kind of domain/job you intend to be working
 reCurse: If so then you could do a quick look at the hiring markets
 unknownbeast: reCurse i have a question
 reCurse: Should give you an idea of how the prospects might be
 jacek: browse job offerts with django. python is more likely used in machine learning/ai stuff
 Sakshi_Jain: okay
 Sakshi_Jain: thanks&#160;:)
 reCurse: np
 unknownbeast: is it worth it to do a data analytics course alongside CS degree program?
 MSmits: eh depends, not if you want to become a game dev :P
 reCurse: Maybe.
 unknownbeast: tbh i m not quite sure 
 unknownbeast: coz its my 1st sem
 MSmits: the thing is, not everything has to lead to a degree or a diploma
 MSmits: you can learn things at your own pace
 MSmits: on the side
 MSmits: so if you want to become better at data analytics, do so on your own terms I'd say
 jrke: so finally i submitted endgamesolver for D&amp;B but with few bugs not bugs but it breaks in joint chains
 MSmits: just as long as you get at least a good degree to find jobs with ofc
 reCurse: Know what your goals are
 unknownbeast: yup i guess i will jump into analytics field 
 MSmits: jrke yeah it's hard
 jrke: for now i just choose the smallest valued chain 
 unknownbeast: Unsure about my goals right now
 reCurse: Then that's where to start
 unknownbeast: thinking on it
 MSmits: jrke sometimes it's better to choose  a string connected  to a joint of &gt;2 size, over a string connected to a joint of &gt;= 2
 MSmits: &lt;= 2 i mean
 unknownbeast: btw thanks for answering.
 MSmits: so it's not always shortest first is what i mean
 jrke: thats why i said breaks in joint chains because i didn't coded anything for that case yet
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i did it the other way around. I allowed all choices and then started to limit them 
 MSmits: basically that's pruning
 jrke: okay
 MSmits: of course when you allow all choices, in the beginning even a simple end game will take a second or something
 jrke: choosing all is making me 100ms +
 MSmits: yes 
 MSmits: but you need to make certain it is correct
 MSmits: and then make it faster
 jrke: yup
 MSmits: for example. the best thing to speed things up at first, is to only allow isolated chains in order of size
 MSmits: and isolated loops in order of size
 MSmits: there's never any reason to open a chain of 4 before a chain of 3
 jrke: damn i was thinking the same ^
 MSmits: but with joints, it's different
 reCurse: Is there any 3rd party which displays multi games sorted by number of players?
 jrke: btw i also reached wood 1 othello its very tough 
 MSmits: looking for a new target reCurse&gt;
 reCurse: Possibly
 reCurse: Didn't build all this for uttt
 MSmits: D&amp;B has a lot of players for a community multi
 MSmits: but you dont want that right
 reCurse: Ideally one that focuses less of calculation algorithms
 MSmits: yeah D&amp;B is a bad idea then
 MSmits: the most mathy game i found on CG
 reCurse: Maybe open to community if it comes down to it
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: tron?
 MSmits: ah no 4p and such
 jacek: :soccer:
 MSmits: you want 1v1 right?
 reCurse: Preferably
 jacek: bt!
 MSmits: perhaps you need a game for which you already have a good sim
 MSmits: not sure if you did all those excontests
 MSmits: you dont want to spend days to get the sim right
 reCurse: Well if the sim is complex then yeah
 jacek: any progress with chess?
 reCurse: If it's something simple then shrug
 MSmits: you did the cotc already didnt you?
 jrke: try tron easy sim
 reCurse: Well I'd rather have something where there's been more effort put
 reCurse: Hence my initial question
 reCurse: cotc?
 MSmits: the pirate game
 reCurse: Been first since the contest :p
 MSmits: ah right, so its not just about testing&#160;:)
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: PCR maybe?
 MSmits: not sure how versatile your NN framework is
 MSmits: does it have to be grids?
 jacek: checkers *.*
 MetehanBayraktar: AlkhilJohn please can you share your code&#160;:)
 MSmits: or continuous games?  Or does it not matter?
 reCurse: Hmm
 jrke: MetehanBayraktar alkhijohn is a clash bot
 reCurse: Might not matter
 reCurse: But PCR I am not sure how to handle the complexity
 MetehanBayraktar: why he doesnt shaere his code&#160;:)
 reCurse: Too far away for me I think
 MSmits: then HS is not really an option either i think
 MSmits: it's grid, but very very complex
 reCurse: Complexity of input and action
 reCurse: So in that sense it's simple
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: yes but its a bad fit i think
 MSmits: with beamsearch for boxes being a perfect way to play and then only in the endgame it becomes about killing and survival
 MSmits: it's almost an optim
 reCurse: Hmm I'll take your word
 MSmits: never done it?
 MSmits: must have been right before you got here
 reCurse: Only contest
 reCurse: Haven't followed the meta after
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: game of drones an option?
 MSmits: too many agents maybe
 reCurse: Same ballpark as PCR
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: i dont really see too many. You're already first in wondev woman also
 MSmits: arent you?
 reCurse: Yeah
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: should i maybe kick you to nr 2 to motivate you?
 reCurse: Tron isn't a bad idea but I really hate the way it's implemented
 MSmits: its been a while
 MSmits: you're better now, I can maybe beat the old recurse
 reCurse: eh
 BlaiseEbuth: StC
 reCurse: Done
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah
 jacek: so all the left are community
 reCurse: Maybe TGE
 MSmits: community games are definitely better fits for your NN
 MSmits: the girder thing gives huge branching and you have to deal with multiple opponents
 MSmits: but if you can find a way around that it seems ok
 reCurse: So which communities are popular
 MSmits: did you take a look at onitama?
 MSmits: i mean do you know the rules?
 reCurse: No
 jrke: D&amp;B
 MSmits: there's a card mechanic for what allowed moves are. Thats the only thing that might be problematic. otherwise it's perfect for NN
 MSmits: it's a pretty game
 MSmits: 179 on leaderboard
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Interesting
 MSmits: including a few really good ones
 MSmits: dbd r/jacek/tric trac/ kar liso
 reCurse: Hope I won't regret it when it comes to submitting
 MSmits: why would you regret it
 MSmits: if it fails, it fails
 darkhorse64: yavalath 
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: Garbage rankings
 MSmits: yavalath is going to be really frustrating
 MSmits: dont do that
 reCurse: Even legend isn't enough for uttt
 Darvy: hola
 MSmits: well the rankings arent garbage
 MSmits: but not great either
 jacek: MSmits why would you ping me and not the other
 jacek: s
 MSmits: cuz you were active already
 MSmits: and you're first in onitama
 jacek: still
 MSmits: oh reCurse, big plus for you. No way anyone can counterbook 
 MSmits: in onitama that is
 MSmits: 300k+ different starts
 MSmits: because of the cards
 jacek: fix your math. a little over 100k
 jacek: cards combinations that it
 MSmits: yes but who gets which cards?
 MSmits: p1 /p2 / middle
 MSmits: i think there are 30 ways to divide 5 cards among two players and the middle
 reCurse: That is an incentive indeed
 MSmits: 5 different ways to place a card in the middle and then 4 * 3 / 2 for the card for player 1.   5 * 6 = 30
 MSmits: but there's like 15 cards i think
 MSmits: if you do choose onitama, you should first think whether it is even feasible before you waste time doing the sims and such
 jacek: 16 cards. isnt this more like (16 2) * (14 2) * 11 or something
 MSmits: because of the cards
 MSmits: it seems messy
 reCurse: Well yeah naturally
 MSmits: 16*15*14*13*12/5!  I think? 
 MSmits: and then times 30?
 reCurse: Is there any difference in wood 1
 MSmits: that would be 131k, not sure if i got it right
 jacek: only boss
 reCurse: Ok thanks
 jacek: it was binomial
 MSmits: reCurse I have to say it is also just an enjoyable game. Not sure if this is important to you, but I like the games as much as writing the bots for them
 reCurse: Yeah I agree, why else do you think I hate uttt so much
 jacek: 1 player gets 2 out of 16 cards, then second player gets 2 of the 14 cards and then there is 12 cards
 MSmits: ahh alright
 jacek: combinatorics eh
 MSmits: jacek it's better to split the 5 card out 15 and then multiply by the 30 ways they can be distributed
 MSmits: 16 i mean
 jacek: or... create bots that will count all the combinations
 MSmits: lol i dont doubt there are many coders that would prefer to quickly code a brute force over just doing the math :P
 kovi: uh, someone split the d&amp;b pack
 MSmits: not exactly
 MSmits: it's like this
 MSmits: Remi won every game against everyone else
 MSmits: 50 rating vs 40 or so
 MSmits: then i did as well, including 60% winrate vs remi
 reCurse: Thanks for the suggestion I'll look into it later
 MSmits: then mikkla ruined everyones day
 MSmits: np reCurse, have fun
 kovi: i know. i meant 4th-9th....we were all within 0.01 yesterday
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: thats jrke
 MSmits: he spammed submits, my last battles is full
 kovi: true. and atm im lucky vs. him
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: I need to get back to D&amp;B soon, still have some untried ideas
 MSmits: dont even have any logic for ply 0-50, just random moves
 kovi: i probably need more depth...than 0
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: how come your bot does this well then?
 MSmits: really good heuristics?
 kovi: it seems
 MSmits: did you look into the papers?
 MSmits: what to do with chains and such?
 kovi: i found it out myself
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: I spent lots of time to write an endgame solver, but its not really that important. It helps a bit, but generally when you win, you win by a lot
 kovi: too bad only now. 40 years ago would have been more effective
 MSmits: lol yes
 kovi: vs. my schoolmates. and depth 0 is almost doable by hand
 MSmits: well your set of heuristics might be quite useful as a pruning or eval thing in a search
 kovi: true
 MSmits: but the main issue is what to do to gain control right before the end game
 MSmits: playing the end game perfectly is what gets you into the pack
 kovi: without depth all i can do is lure when im loosing
 MSmits: lure?
 kovi: lure enemy to make mistake
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: you can check if you make mistakes in the endgame by playing games against my bot
 MSmits: it solves at ply 55-60 or so
 MSmits: so if you see the score change that my bot predicts, you made a mistake
 kovi:&#160;:)
 MSmits: even when you're winning, you can see your margin shrink
 MSmits: anyways look into nimstring analysis to really get a good bot. I dont doubt both remi and mikla did this
 MSmits: or they do "chain counting" which is basically unformalized nimstring analysis
 kovi: but after the masses of heurstic in raic i might look into a proper solveable (mcts, or whatever) multi.
 MSmits: D&amp;B is searchable though
 MSmits: it's just really complicated
 MSmits: my endgame solver is a negamax
 kovi: maybe i will invest in breakthrough
 MSmits: great choice
 MSmits: fun game
 MSmits: I don't see you too often on community board games
 reCurse: :eyes:
 MSmits: oh right reCurse breakthrough is another option for you, but this one's bookable
 MSmits: NN will be good though
 MSmits: also i wont be booking it, because i dont even have a good bot
 reCurse: Onitama looks great but maybe I need an intermediate step, the moves are puzzling me a bit for now
 MSmits: contrary to popular belief, an opening book generator actually needs a good bot first :P
 kovi: cause i like finding out algos + heuristics more than use/finetune a single optim search
 reCurse: Othello and BT look like other options
 MSmits: you are going to be really frustrated with  othello
 reCurse:&#160;?
 MSmits: lemme pm you why
 jacek: othello is quite NNable or Ntupleable
 MSmits: thats true
 jacek: and i dont mind worthy opponent in breakthrough
 reCurse: What did you do, ntuple?
 jacek: for breakthrough, NN
 reCurse: convnet I guess?
 jacek: nope. simple MLP for eval
 reCurse: Ah. Surprised it works
 jacek: partially updatable, as only few squares are affected in move. a bit like nnue
 reCurse: Makes sense
 VizGhar: I wonder when I'll be able to come up with ideas like u guys :P so far I'm only catching on terminology
 kovi: for nn i'm doing the same...
 darkhorse64: If I tell you that two years, I had never heard of MCTS, Genetic algos, Beam search, BFS
 darkhorse64: two years ago
 MSmits: VizGhar you dont need to learn NN to do well in most multis
 reCurse: Yet
 MSmits: I do wonder if it ever becomes necessary in all multis
 MSmits: some just arent a good fit for it I expect
 MSmits: within the limits of CG codesize that is
 reCurse: I'm fairly convinced, maybe just not in the forms everyone expects
 MSmits: well i suppose you can use NN in some sort of local meta training 
 reCurse: You think we have any chance monkeying constants?
 MSmits: to speed up fitting all sorts of stuff
 MSmits: whats that?
 reCurse: Why monkey constants when you can monkey hyperconstants
 kovi: yeah that makes sense
 MSmits: what do you mean by monkeying?
 reCurse: What CG is mad eof
 kovi: trying finetuning semirandomly
 MSmits: this is going over my head
 reCurse: If you put a million monkeys on a million constants maybe you end up with alphazero
 jacek: this is probably what you do when optimizing params for your bots anyway
 reCurse: But robot monkeys? Oh boy.
 MSmits: i get the monkey metaphor now
 reCurse: I'd rather monkey on the number of bananas to give
 JonasNicolaysen: a
 jacek: it sucks when i want to learn about optimization, but my randomly hand-picked params are already near optimal
 jacek: as in, intuition. can ai have that intuition too?
 MSmits: that happens to me sometimes
 reCurse: Intuition is just generalized statistics
 MSmits: reCurse do you mean for example, that you train a NN to tell you which eval parameters values (say 10) for which combination of cards in onitama and then just run a regular mm bot using those params
 reCurse: That's one of a million possibilities
 MSmits: ahh ok, then i kinda get what you're saying
 reCurse: Your typical evaluation is just a fully connected layer to one output
 reCurse: Then you monkey the parameters
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: jacek does a better job of this though
 MSmits: using TD and all that
 reCurse: Upper tier monkey
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: though he prefers the pony pronoun
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: just saying you know how to fit params well
 MSmits: i am pinging you today a lot but its ok cuz they are compliments
 reCurse: Weird day uh
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: you just need to have gazillion positions labeled by smart bot (or dumb bot with deep analysis)
 MSmits: *just*
 reCurse: Statistics
 MSmits: I am supposed to be writing a design document for a game
 reCurse: Teacher procrastinating writing a document?
 MSmits: as part of a course for studt credits
 reCurse: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Did you finish your unity game?
 MSmits: no i am a student here
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it works, darkhorse tested it
 reCurse: Ship it
 Astrobytes: Nice. Happy with it?
 MSmits: reasonably strong yavalath ap
 MSmits: app
 jacek: pc?
 MSmits: yeah kinda
 MSmits: I can share it with you in pm if you want, but dont do it openly, not sure if i can use the yavalath name, thats probably the only copyrighted part
 jacek: nah
 MSmits: its on itch.io
 MSmits: but not searchable
 jacek: but you could post screenshot
 MSmits: ahh ok i will, sec
 jacek: is it web?
 reCurse: Is it really copyrighted though
 Astrobytes: As long as you're not selling it you should be fine name-wise anyway.
 jacek: i would pirate it anyway :imp:
 Astrobytes: I see your UTTT NN lived up to your expectations reCurse, well done.
 MSmits: reCurse i think the name of it is copyrighted
 MSmits: you cant copyright the game mechanics
 reCurse: Thanks
 reCurse: Seems counterproductive to me but oh well
 jacek: call it htalavay then
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/jzw8Xq4">https://ibb.co/jzw8Xq4</a>
 Astrobytes: Lavayath, as previously suggested.
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: i got around the steal rule by just disallowing starting in the center
 jacek: whats the ai? mcts? with books?
 MSmits: no books, pretty strong negamax bot
 MSmits: with ab and TT
 MSmits: had some problems translating the intrinsics
 MSmits: to C# which would be compiled to webgl
 MSmits: pdep and pext and such arent very fast when it's a function with a loop&#160;:(
 MSmits: still searched about 6 deep in early game which is not bad with 60 or so branching
 jacek: killer move heuristic?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: phew
 MSmits: as in, it tries the best move from an earlier iteration first
 MSmits: i think that was killer
 MSmits: takes that from the TT
 jacek: thats something else
 Astrobytes: history
 MSmits: whats that again?
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: then not killer
 jacek: it tries good move from the same ply it its legal
 MSmits: ahh ok, thats questionable for many games. Maybe not here though
 MSmits: btw, i basically used ntuples, but with every Ntuple using identical params
 MSmits: sets of 4
 MSmits: 102 of them
 jacek: and putting values manually. like a monkey
 MSmits: yes, a lower tier monkey
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 MSmits: at least it beats me over half the time which is good I think. From what i read about yavalath most bots are easy to beat
 MSmits: doubt thats the case for most of the bots on our leaderboard here though
 MSmits: we would shred most of those researchers bots I bet&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: The point of Y was to make a game that was hard for a bot to play iirc?
 MSmits: yeah mcts specifically
 jacek: nah. it was made by genetic algorithm
 MSmits: jacek is right, thats not how it was developed, but its one of the big pros they cite when talking about it
 reCurse: There's yavalath research?
 MSmits: yavalath was created by an AI
 jacek: mostly on how it was created
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: That and the other ones.
 reCurse: No, you said "researcher bots"
 MSmits: oh, the creator did do some research on it
 MSmits: and published that
 reCurse: I see
 jacek: i remember he made mcts bot with 45k iterations in 10 seconds
 MSmits: struc t talked to him
 MSmits: he didnt even know all center hexes are solved 
 MSmits: just the 1 in the center
 MSmits: so we're ahead in research
 jacek: publish a paper on that
 MSmits: it's not much of a feat though
 Astrobytes: I told him to do that already jacek
 MSmits: not like solving checkers and such
 reCurse: Didn't stop a lot of them /snark
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: maybe i should just share how i do the rollouts
 MSmits: thats much more interesting
 MSmits: because yavalath needs such heavy rollouts for  mcts to work
 MSmits: the solving of the 6 hexes around the center is just turning on meta mcts and wait. A specificly designed solver could do it in an hour if it is good
 MSmits: Does anyone have any idea why mcts solver is such a great way to solve games in a bot btw? I always assumed a good negamax would be more efficient, but it really isn't
 jacek: negamax requires good eval or idea which position is good or bad
 reCurse: Not sure what you mean
 MSmits: sure, but i managed with 0 rollout EPT also
 MSmits: 0 depth
 jacek: :shrug_tone1:
 MSmits: reCurse on expansion, the game might be solved
 MSmits: then you backpropagate that solved value
 MSmits: thats mcts solver
 MSmits: it works just as well as negamax
 reCurse: Why wouldn't it?
 MSmits: i would expect the overhead from the whole mcts algorithm and rollouts would reduce the solving power i guess
 MSmits: which would mean you play good moves but not necessarily solve fast
 reCurse: Oh you mean perf wise
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: my experience is that it solves really well
 reCurse: That's incredibly specific
 MSmits: and it always surprises me
 MSmits: quite a few bots do a "WIN" or "LOSS"output and when they are negamax they usually dont beat mcts solver
 reCurse: Lack of structured search maybe
 MSmits: look at mine when trying onitama, it is often done 15 plies ahead when karliso is 3-4 plies later
 MSmits: yeah probably
 reCurse: Seems likely it would be just as fine if implemented as a tree
 MSmits: probably says more about why mcts is good
 reCurse: But then they would be quite similar, not sure calling them negamax or mcts is accurate at all
 MSmits: well it's a solver guided by mcts
 MSmits: isnt it already implemented as a tree?
 reCurse: There's no tree in negamax
 MSmits: you're using the same mcts expanded nodes, except you slap a "solved" property
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: true
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: noticed in connect4 also, me and darkhorse solve 20-30 plies before the end
 MSmits: tric trac does quite well with his negamax, but does not always match
 reCurse: Negamax is not made for solving
 MSmits: neither is mcts, thats why it surprises me
 reCurse: It's made to find guaranteed best move at depth bound
 reCurse: No mcts is made for solving
 reCurse: Just not the way you think
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: you mean because it is best-first?
 reCurse: Structured search
 reCurse: Negamax is just a dumb iterator
 MSmits: true, but structured could be anything. It's structured to avoid exploring bad branches
 reCurse: Not made for exploiting
 reCurse: That's why you rely on all those tricks to simulate a structured search
 jacek: if you want to solve things, look on proof numbers
 MSmits: yeah PNS
 MSmits: i did look into that
 MSmits: but you dont use that inside of a bot, because when you fail you have nothing&#160;:)
 reCurse: Negamax doesn't know and keep any information it just enumerates
 MSmits: still works quite well in many cases
 reCurse: Sure
 reCurse: But that's why it's not adapted to solving imo
 MSmits: they use it as a benchmark in papers about solving
 MSmits: as kind of a worst way to do it I guess
 reCurse: It's a good baseline
 reCurse: Just like random move
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: the trash people publish sometimes. I swear I read one that said: "our agent did not beat the random agent" 
 MSmits: forgot where this was
 MSmits: but jeez
 Astrobytes: There are many ridiculous papers out there.
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: I make it a rule whenever I open a paper I do a quick scan and try to pick up bullshit
 reCurse: Saves me a lot of time
 reCurse: Usually found in the results section
 jacek: i just look for experimental results
 jacek: if its only pure theory, meh.
 MSmits: the problem is that sometimes they try something, like a NN for a game and then conclude that it didnt work, which may give people the general idea it's not feasible
 Astrobytes: Standard way to check out a paper from any field&#160;:)
 reCurse: Any flaw I find in methodology results in a tab close
 reCurse: That's fine though
 jacek: every game is NN friendly, you just need to find right inputs
 MSmits: right
 eulerscheZahl: you have to print those papers first
 reCurse: But usually they claim breakthrough and then you look at the actual claim and it's meh
 jacek: maybe you read paper on breakthrough?
 reCurse: ...
 jacek:&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats what i hate about that game
 Astrobytes: Actually, now I think of it - the date. Always check the date...
 MSmits: pick a better name 
 MSmits: google doesnt know what i mean
 MSmits: when i search
 eulerscheZahl: now I can't find it anymore. someone adviced to print a certain style guide. just so you can burn it afterwards as a symbolic gesture
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and then proceeded to describe the own style guide
 MSmits: i vaguely remember reading something like that
 eulerscheZahl: with point on which i strongly disagree (use spaces, not tabs. and indent by 8)
 eulerscheZahl: by 8 )
 MSmits: 8 what?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it was some linux style guide
 jacek: 8)
 MSmits: 8 spaces&#160;!?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: why?
 eulerscheZahl: as i said: i disagree
 MSmits: yes, but why?
 MSmits: why 8?
 eulerscheZahl: readability
 MSmits: but it's not more readable with 8
 MSmits: you will have a few layers deep, 3-4 is common enough
 MSmits: thats 32 characters already
 reCurse: 8? You heretical demon.
 MSmits: I dislike 1, but 2,3 or 4 is fine
 eulerscheZahl: 2 is too less. but 8 is total overkill
 MSmits: tab is fine
 reCurse: No.
 MSmits: You do 1 reCurse?
 reCurse: 4 spaces
 reCurse: Tabs are :door:
 MSmits: how many spaces is a tab?
 reCurse: Which is exactly why they're out
 jacek: yes
 jacek: AutomatonNN how many spaces are in tab
 AutomatonNN: because that is a problem
 MSmits: oh you mean it's up to the interpretation of your program?
 MSmits: and you dont like that?
 reCurse: Makes indentation impossible
 reCurse: Or aligning
 MSmits: not sure, if all tabs are the same why is it not aligned?
 reCurse: Because you're assuming everything that needs alignment is precisely on a tab boundary
 reCurse: Variable length words tends to disagree
 reCurse: Which is why it's nonsense
 MSmits: hmm ok... But i only tend to tab words, functions, conditional statements etc.
 MSmits: not words sry
 MSmits: just the normal loopy, conditional, function stuff
 MSmits: thats all aligned with tabs
 MSmits: what kind of stuff are you spacing?
 reCurse: Constants, arguments, etc.
 MSmits: ohh i always space that
 reCurse: Say you want to align the parameters coming after a (
 reCurse: On a different line
 reCurse: Well, can't do that with tabs, sorry.
 reCurse: Just one example
 MSmits: ahh right, 
 MSmits: i never do that
 MSmits: i have long ass lines
 MSmits: for params :P
 reCurse: Constraints over nothing
 MSmits: but i get your point now
 eulerscheZahl: but what's wrong with tabs?
 reCurse: ...
 eulerscheZahl: i want to indent by 4, so i configure a tab that way
 MSmits: someone else will open your code in a different IDE
 eulerscheZahl: someone else has a different taste but no need to reformat the code
 reCurse: That's made false whenever someone uses any space
 MSmits: do different IDEs have different tab sizes?
 reCurse: And trust me it will happen
 eulerscheZahl: exactly. i see it as a feature that the same code can look differently
 MSmits: reCurse's carefully aligned params will look like spaghetti
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, a mix of spaces and tabs is deadly
 reCurse: Customization is not desirable
 MSmits: well I think this is the big difference when you're a solo coder. Noone ever sees my code. You would not believe the crap i get away with
 reCurse: Then the variable tab size doesn't really hold does it
 Astrobytes: Do you tap 4 times or do you have a hotkey though...
 reCurse: You use any of the dozens of decent text editors out there and have a tab output 4 spaces
 reCurse: The issue is not about the number of taps
 MSmits: yeah i guess that would be fine
 reCurse: Unlike what that SV show tried to do
 eulerscheZahl: we should use more vertical tabs for paragraphs
 MSmits: now i know what the big thing was about coders using spaces making more money than coders using tabs
 Astrobytes: Ah right. I thought you were saying something else. My tabs output 4 spaces.
 MSmits: i thought they were using less space 
 MSmits: but they're just using 4 spaces instead of a tab
 reCurse: Pretty stupid study tbh
 MSmits: obviously you get :money_mouth: that way
 reCurse: But it achieved its clickbait purpose
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: Someone did a study on that? smh
 MSmits: you just ask a bunch of coders whether they use tabs or spaces and ask or guess their salary
 Astrobytes: I guarantee it's a load of bollocks.
 MSmits: well it might be true, but still not have the right conclusions drawn from it
 MSmits: those space users may just be older on average, like a space generation vs a tab generation
 MSmits: younger people make less 
 Astrobytes: I haven't read it so I won't comment further, but it sounds suspect.
 jacek: actually i dont know if i use spaces or tabs at work o.O
 jacek: i just write function or loop, write { and do enter afterwards and it indents autoamtically
 MSmits: haha
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/">https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/</a>
 MSmits: is age horizontal?
 MSmits: doesnt say
 MSmits: oh yeah if you scroll
 mzbear: most likely related to programming language specific cultures, though, and not individual preference
 MSmits: ah right
 MSmits: at least they took the experience/age variable into account
 reCurse: If I had to make a wild guess, it probably has to do with the arguments I mentioned generally applied in big companies where you have to coordinate a bunch of mo...coders together.
 mzbear: although they claim the effect exists in every language specific subgroup too, hmm.  i didn't actually read before linking, lol
 reCurse: Big companies tend to pay more.
 reCurse: So there you go.
 MSmits: makes sense
 Astrobytes: Yes, I'm surprised that wasn't in the article, they already accounted for country
 MSmits: so tabs vs spaces is a contentious issue
 MSmits: is it the same with comments vs descriptive functon names
 reCurse: There's easier
 reCurse: Casing
 VizGhar: i press tab and it prints 4 spaces&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: pfft, commentswho wants to plant grass in the code?
 reCurse: There you go
 MSmits: it really turns me away when i find a gith page where there's 1 line of code, 3 line of comments, 2 empty lines and another line of code
 Astrobytes: There're good comments and bad comments
 Flashback813: how would i go about fixing the "your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction" warning
 eulerscheZahl: i like those XML comments in C# that pop up for autocompletion
 VizGhar: Just javadoc is fine (if ...)
 eulerscheZahl: and that allow you to extract some documentation
 darkhorse64: my favorite comment is to have C code along my AVX intrinsics. Beauty &amp; the beast
 jacek: Flashback813 do you read all the inputs before outputting the solution
 eulerscheZahl: but that type of comment// gets Xpublic int getX()
 MSmits: Flashback813 either you dont read all the input or you produce output before finishing reading the input, or you produce 2 outputs in a row, or sometimes you dont output at all
 eulerscheZahl: meh, more clutter than anything else
 Astrobytes: That's understandable darkhorse64
 Flashback813: alright thanks. Let's hope I can fix it easily
 darkhorse64: No, it's not :grinning:
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: most likely there are just situations where some conditional statement lets you output twice
 MSmits: happens to me all the time
 VizGhar: switch&#160;: case&#160;? :P
 MSmits: usually i am just in a hurry, add a bunch of lines and forgot an absolete output statement
 MSmits: obsolete
 darkhorse64: I absolute you
 MSmits: the warning is just a confusing message, you dont immediately think of this
 MSmits: thanks
 jacek: warnings are for losers
 MSmits: thanks also
 darkhorse64: ban directly
 MSmits: btw, i now have nodes in connect 4 that go 21 plies deep
 MSmits: just from letting the meta mcts go with exploration parameter 2
 MSmits: not interfering with it
 MSmits: it's definitely easier to solve than uttt and the like
 jacek: uh huh
 darkhorse64: You have even more when your solver says WIN 25 plies before the end, no&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm, how do yo umean
 MSmits: i use this solver inside of my meta mcts also, it reports a solved node when it solves immediatel
 MSmits: happens a lot in early game already on a blunder
 darkhorse64: I mean that it goes even deeper than you think
 MSmits: hmm, I think what you mean is that it has depth from the end to the middle and the beginning to the middle. When they meet up the game starts to solve quickly
 MSmits: but thats not any time soon
 darkhorse64: No news from the C4 author&#160;? There are few multis with so much testing
 MSmits: he fixed the last bugs i think
 MSmits: but its a WIP
 MSmits: he needs to put it up for approval
 MSmits: not sure if you can do that early, do you have to wait out the WIP?
 darkhorse64: Yes, we have
 MSmits: oh ok, you should let him know, i dont know the process
 MSmits: this is the first time i bother with any contribution really
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f1b340d2-f86e-459e-b18c-5a5d0e90037d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f1b340d2-f86e-459e-b18c-5a5d0e90037d</a>
 VizGhar: huh? you can put multi to approval right away
 struct: yeah
 struct: it doesnt need to be in WIP
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: hey, mind if i floated my idea for a my design document for a game?
 MSmits: not going to code this
 MSmits: it just needs to be good enough to pass 
 darkhorse64: In WIP, there is no way to approve/refuse a multi. Corner moves away from perfect balancing
 MSmits: it has before, to 55%, then went back down
 jacek: but author can change it to nonWIP
 VizGhar: darkhorse64 true... jacek true... MSmits im curious about that game... but dont have time either
 darkhorse64: You have a project for a game, MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: I have 2 assingments
 MSmits: unity demo (you tried it, its done)
 MSmits: and a design document for a game i dont have to code
 Astrobytes: Why didn't you do the design doc for your unity game?
 MSmits: this is an existing game
 jacek: no need to make it? make design for cyberpunk 2088
 MSmits: the unity game
 MSmits: it needs to be somewhat original
 MSmits: and it doesnt have to be within my reach
 MSmits: could be a triple A game if i want it to b e
 MSmits: its just a creative exercise
 MSmits: so i was thinking
 MSmits: I use a yavalath shaped board, maybe larger maybe smaller
 MSmits: but hex
 MSmits: multiple players try to make 5 in a row
 jacek: yavalath already is hex
 MSmits: yes 
 Astrobytes: Oh right. Brane based game then. With hexes.
 MSmits: then they also have cards
 MSmits: the cards control gravity on the board (6 directions)
 MSmits: you can play 1 hex and 1 card on your turn
 VizGhar: Make a football ball board&#160;:) 5 and 6 sided shapes... you will be most original board designer ever
 MSmits: there's also explosion cards where you can explode one of your opponents'hexes or your own
 MSmits: shooting the surrounding hexes as far as possible
 Astrobytes: Meh. Not enough supergravity.
 MSmits: and maybe like a chain bomb thingy
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: teacher said i would need to put more fun into the game
 MSmits: hence the explosions and changes in gravity
 MSmits: more randomness etc.
 jacek: make funeral game. it already has fun in it
 MSmits: whats that?
 jacek: a pun
 MSmits: ohh
 Astrobytes: funeral contains 'fun' as a substring
 MSmits: got it
 reCurse: Now you wish you didn't
 MSmits: mostly i understand jacek's trollpuns, not this time though :P
 Astrobytes: That was pretty good for one of jaceks tbh.
 MSmits: but think this will do the trick and give me a passing grade if i write it well?
 VizGhar: if you play around you can also have 'real fun'
 MSmits: yeah it was fine
 Astrobytes: lol VizGhar
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Seems legit enough MSmits
 jacek: good for one of jaceks? are others bad?
 Astrobytes: But I'm no expert
 Astrobytes: I didn't say one of 'the jaceks'
 MSmits: it only has to be ok really... I'm probably going to get a really high grade for the demo
 MSmits: the other students just pimped their roll a ball tutorial
 Astrobytes: Meh. Aim high.
 MSmits: time permitting
 darkhorse64: MSmits game wrecked me
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Can you bot it?
 MSmits: you mean this design document?
 Astrobytes: No. your actual game.
 MSmits: it has AI
 MSmits: you play vs AI
 MSmits: not vs other humans
 Astrobytes: Can you send/receive requests I mean, so you can write a bot for it.
 MSmits: i didnt want to get into multiplayer and such, seems hard
 MSmits: oh no, unfortunately not
 MSmits: basically i just gave it 1000 iterations *10 per level
 MSmits: so beginner is 1000 "sims"
 MSmits: master AI is 1 million sims
 MSmits: negamax sims
 jacek: negamax sims? w00t
 MSmits: i mean calls of the function i guess
 Astrobytes: A million negamaxes??
 MSmits: not sure how to define
 MSmits: it's a recursive function, it's called a million times total per turn
 jacek: depth limit would be more natural
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: well but then it wouldnt get deeper nearer the endgame
 jacek: so time
 MSmits: currently it does depth 6 at the start, depth 12 at around halfway
 Astrobytes: Iterative deepening?
 MSmits: yes, but what if you run it on a bad pc, then it'd be easier to beat
 MSmits: it has that
 Astrobytes: fix your timestep issues
 MSmits: nah, i like the limits to the negamax calls
 MSmits: it's similar to the difficulty a human would have with more or less branching and depth
 MSmits: with less branching a human can look deeper also
 MSmits: i had to set a minimum on wait time though, otherwise it would instantly make a move sometimes
 MSmits: thats confusing, it almost seems like he's cheating and you dont know its your turn again
 reCurse: Basic UX
 MSmits: yeah, i suppose it's that
 darkhorse64: Yeah when it replies instantly, I know I'm dead in a few moves
 MSmits: but i am supposed to run into basic things, this is a basic game design course&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Do you output "thinking..."
 MSmits: darkhorse64 lol, indeed
 MSmits: nah, i did think of that, but i just stopped at some point Astrobytes. The demo is good enough
 reCurse: That wasn't a criticism
 MSmits: i meant i drew the line somewhere, it would be cool to have thinking...
 MSmits: and also as darkhorse64 suggested, a list of moves and such
 Astrobytes: no reCurse means his 'basic UX' comment wasn't a criticism
 MSmits: and maybe some hints to show which hexes are insta loss etc.
 MSmits: ohh 
 MSmits: i knew that
 MSmits: but it's indeed basic UX
 reCurse: It's funny I often think I need a personal translator
 Astrobytes: I'm here most nights.
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: did you read jesse Schell reCurse?
 reCurse:&#160;?
 MSmits: supposed to be a game design guru
 reCurse: Never heard of
 Astrobytes: He's spot on though. Imagine if all game AI (gaming games, not botting) implemented full-blown AI players
 MSmits: The art of game design
 MSmits: he has these lenses, perspectives with which to look at designing games
 Astrobytes: You'd not play that game for long.
 reCurse: At the risk of sounding dismissive, what did he make?
 MSmits: i think it would be really entertaining for you to read
 MSmits: let me look it up
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb1ea2f2-f312-4ebb-b4ce-a484729c371e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb1ea2f2-f312-4ebb-b4ce-a484729c371e</a>
 MSmits: thats what it says on his wiki
 reCurse: game design... guru?
 Astrobytes: "In addition to his other achievements, Jesse has also been a writer, director, performer, juggler, comedian, and circus artist for both Freihofer's Mime Circus and the Juggler's Guild" - I am sold.
 MSmits: well as in teacher/writer
 MSmits: some people are good at teaching, less at doing
 reCurse: Not particularly impressed
 MSmits: you might like the book anyway, i did
 reCurse: Maybe
 MSmits: The art of game design
 MSmits: its basically our course material
 reCurse: I just have too much to do and read and watch and whatever so I tend to filter a lot
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: just suggesting it because it's your line of work and it seems to be popular
 reCurse: An attempt at expressing extreme cynicism has been successfully deflected.
 reCurse: But thanks
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Oh I see, taking the traditional game creation approach and applying to 'video games'.
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes its not just video games
 MSmits: he also talks about board games and whatnot
 reCurse: Ok I have to let a bit slip: would be my line of work if I was indie or something
 MSmits: hmm thats a part of it, but his book is also just about what makes games great etc.
 MSmits: philosophical in places
 Astrobytes: heh, reCurse giving us some insight there.
 MSmits: doesnt really matter if it is AAA or not
 jacek: why i think of india whenever i read indie
 MSmits: I know that one
 Astrobytes: . . .
 reCurse: Oh I feel the need to clarify my gripe is much more about the state of the market than the company
 MSmits: anyway, i wasn't trying to peddle this book. I was just pleasantly surprised reading it. Course material is usually boring to me
 MSmits: reCurse I'm pretty sure you told us this before, but why the market? I'll probably remember if you tell a little more
 reCurse: Oh boy, the can of worms.
 Astrobytes: I guess it's the same issue that plagues all forms of entertainment, monetization. Moar content, moar powerups, moar badges, moar behind-the-scenes-extras, 
 MSmits: yes, i just need 1 worm probably
 reCurse: Trying to find a way to summarize it in one sentence
 MSmits: oh right, so micro transactions for more features?
 reCurse: It's broader than that
 MSmits: eternal crunch?
 reCurse: Let's see
 reCurse: The enormous majority of the industry has forgotten what gaming is about.
 reCurse: There.
 MSmits: do you mean the big companies or also indie?
 Astrobytes: Fun?
 reCurse: And it's all thanks to it being massively profitable.
 reCurse: But I'm making a living off it so what right do I have to say anything
 struct: Mobile games is even worse
 Astrobytes: Quite a lot of rights to talk about it if you're in the industry imo.
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: Yeah but what I'm against is also what pays me.
 reCurse: So short of being a hypocrite
 reCurse: No right
 MSmits: it's like how google employees talk about their algorithm ruining societies even though they make money off of it
 MSmits: its good they talk about it
 MSmits: because they know
 Astrobytes: I'm pretty sure one or more of us here has been in a job they fundamentally disagree with in some aspect(s).
 Astrobytes: It's not a crime to make a living.
 MSmits: right
 reCurse: That's not what I'm saying
 MSmits: you wouldn't be making any change if you quit your job and then started talking about it. I think it's better that a lot of people in the business think like you and stay
 reCurse: That would be like complaining about capitalism while sipping your starbucks chai latte
 reCurse: Have more self-respect than that
 MSmits: capitalism isnt the problem though, game devs made money before, making money is generally a good motivation to produce quality
 MSmits: the problem is free to play stuff to lure people in
 MSmits: that didnt exist before
 MSmits: and pay to win
 reCurse: Making money is not a motivation for quality at all
 reCurse: What
 reCurse: Sorry that's nonsense
 MSmits: the idea of what i said is that if you make good stuff, people buy it :P
 reCurse: lol
 MSmits: it's not *that* far fetched
 MSmits: but currently the visibility of your product is more important than the quality
 reCurse: That's something I used to believe
 reCurse: Not anymore
 reCurse: That's bullshit sorry
 Astrobytes: Making money is making money.
 MSmits: i think people still dont buy crap
 MSmits: the problem is that excellent stuff is no longer made
 reCurse: It's only true for a niche of people
 reCurse: Quality instantly degrades when you step out of that niche
 Astrobytes: Well a lot of people make a lot of money out of selling it to people MSmits.
 reCurse: That happened for gaming the same way it happened for most forms of entertainment
 MSmits: what i mean is, relatively they sell mediocre games. But not total crap
 MSmits: quality still matters to some degree
 reCurse: There is zero incentive for quality stuff.
 reCurse: When it happens it's in spite of.
 MSmits: so when two games are otherwise the same and one of them has quality, why would people buy the other?
 zhoubou: Marketing?
 reCurse: Because most people don't work that way
 reCurse: That's naive
 MSmits: hmm
 reCurse: Look at how twitch is trendsetting now
 reCurse: Gives you a lot of insight
 reCurse: On how things actually work
 MSmits: btw how short term are we talking about, last time i seriously gamed is a few years ago
 MSmits: I still had fun with games like Witcher 3 and such
 reCurse: That's a recent development
 reCurse: But just a continuation really
 MSmits: ah well i cant argue if we're talking about something thats really recent
 reCurse: A lot of marketing now is about buying the right influencers
 reCurse: Quality? lol
 Astrobytes: The Diablo marketplace thing was my warning signal, but I digress.
 Astrobytes: "Influencers" - yep. There you go.
 reCurse: Only needs to be good enough
 reCurse: The bare minimum most people will be fine with
 reCurse: Anything else is a waste
 Astrobytes: We even have CG "influencers" - see the last contest numbers.
 MSmits: I have no problem agreeing the importance of quality dropped, but it's not completely black and white is it? There must be some degree of importance. Even if it is little
 reCurse: Of course but I need to set the tone here
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: Quality sells is a myth
 mzbear: much of gaming these days is content driven, and players don't buy games because of the game mechanics but because of the content, and how it aligns with their fantasies etc
 MSmits: the packaging
 reCurse: ^ Starting to get somewhere
 Astrobytes: In all industries reCurse, not just in games.
 reCurse: I know
 reCurse: I also said all entertainment
 reCurse: Just gaming the most recent
 MSmits: I guess i am having trouble with the concept because it does not at all apply to me personally
 reCurse: Or is it streaming? I dunno
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I know you know. But even beyond entertainment.
 MSmits: pretty much out of touch with most of the degradation of society, not having a smartphone either
 MSmits: pretty depressing 
 reCurse: Yeah no shit
 MSmits: was that 1 worm
 MSmits:&#160;?
 reCurse: You let them out
 MSmits: yeah yeah
 Astrobytes: Just functional product with minimal cost and maximum income. And yes mzbear, it's the same way that TV adverts for products work.
 reCurse: So I just try to find whatever niche where I can have fun, push boundaries and apply quality.
 reCurse: But gaming is not my line of work.
 MSmits: good
 reCurse: Let's be real.
 reCurse: *game design
 MSmits: line of interest maybe
 Astrobytes: You buy X product because the advert sells you your fantasy. Or what it thinks your fantasy should be.
 reCurse: Killed thanks to it
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 reCurse: Ok I lied
 struct: Did you work on any triple A game re curse?
 MSmits: he sure did
 Heiwu: hi guys! could someone pls help translating "%" to ascii in python? i do f"{ord(char):b}" and get 100101 but codingame (chuck norris) is expecting 0100101. why do they add the 0 to the left? other test cases (Strings "C" and "CC" do work (their binary coded strings start with a 1 and have 7 bit). should i add a leading zero in front of the result string if it only has 6 bit?
 reCurse: Yeah I did
 reCurse: Well still am
 struct: Heiwu you must pad the binary
 struct: to have 7 bits
 reCurse: I'm just quite exhausted with the theory when knowing how it goes
 reCurse: I'm all for originality though
 reCurse: There's the occasional game that brings the spark, just getting rarer
 MSmits: ah you migth still like the book then&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe one day, when you're done racking in the $$$, you will want to be indie
 Heiwu: @strukt ok thx i'll try
 Heiwu: @struct ok thx i'll try
 MSmits: my colleague IT teacher used to make 3 times as much as he does now, he quit voluntarily
 reCurse: I'd rather have a very rough, dictated design than one of those polished gambling addictions
 MSmits: Cs teacher i mean
 MSmits: or whatever it is
 struct: gambling is heavily promoted
 struct: Its sad
 reCurse: Disguising addiction as engagement
 reCurse: Makes my blood boil
 Astrobytes: There come certain points in life when you have to distill what you like and what you're good at and filter out the bullshit, and make decisions based around that.
 reCurse: Where 'putting a controller down' is a sign of something bad
 Astrobytes: The gambling thing drives me nuts.
 reCurse: Got really angry with a designer who said that once
 reCurse: :P
 MSmits: even in my country, they nationalized lotteries to protect people from gambling addicition and then proceeded to cause a huge jump in gambling addiction
 reCurse: Professionally of course
 Astrobytes: Passive aggressive email?
 Kokoz: Does anyone knows what theme does the site IDE uses? I want to get it for myself :D
 Astrobytes: MSmits: in the UK we deregulated the gambling industry...
 MSmits: we did the opposite here and it was bad
 MSmits: the state is making its own people addicted to gambling
 Astrobytes: It's terrible here. There is a casino in the town where I live. No shops, a few takeaways nearby, but a pub and casino...
 MSmits: thats bad yeah
 Astrobytes: (in the same vicinity I mean - there are other shops around :P )
 MSmits: of course, you need to buy some food before you go gambling
 struct: Kokoz check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/</a>
 MSmits: btw, about covid... not going back to school on 19th of jan probably&#160;:(
 MSmits: the lockdown was scheduled to end then
 MSmits: but doubtful
 jacek: as a child that information would be great for me
 struct: Well here they decided to close almost everything except schools
 MSmits: will probably be months of online teaching
 Astrobytes: But back on topic, gaming becoming just another way of gambling is indeed one of the grimmest things to happen in recent times.
 struct: They say the problem is not schools
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah&#160;! More holydays&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Yeah, expect to be away for a while MSmits.
 MSmits: i am
 MSmits: struct it will be soon, with new covid variants
 MSmits: students will spread this *fast*
 jacek: thos brits
 MSmits: the old variant was being spread reasonably well in schools during lockdown
 Astrobytes: No jacek: 'that English government'
 MSmits: the only reason schools didnt seem that bad is because everything else was open, but when you lockdown everything but schools, schools become the bottleneck
 Astrobytes: You know they had a scheme over the summer: "Eat out to help out". Vouchers for people to go visit restaurants...
 MSmits: dumb
 MSmits: better to have let the virus die out even more. It was almost gone really, very few cases in july
 MSmits: would have bought a few weeks
 Astrobytes: days matter wrt pandemics.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, enough pandemic crap.
 jacek: lets play plague inc
 Astrobytes: Or the beach management game that BlaiseEbuth plays... Plage Inc.
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 zhoubou: That sounds a lot like our word for beach
 MSmits: which is close to bleach, which is what you drink to cure covid
 MSmits: full circle
 MSmits: hope i dont have to add a joke disclaimer here
 zhoubou: Still can't believe people actually did that though
 VizGhar: :D
 Astrobytes: lol, I don't think so MSmits
 MSmits: are there cases of people doing it?
 Astrobytes: zhoubou it looks like the pronunciation is the same as the French
 MSmits: I know people called authorities to ask
 zhoubou: I heard there were a lot. May be misinformation
 VizGhar: well, mothers in USA killed many kids this way a few years bac&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I believe there were a few real cases.
 VizGhar: because you know "detox"
 Astrobytes: Ah yes, the 'autism cure'
 VizGhar: Idk... but tide pods were quite mess too
 MSmits: maybe they should have tried it themselves first
 MSmits: before poisoining their kids
 zhoubou: Astrobytes Oh it is almost the same, yeah re: beach pronunciation
 Astrobytes: People will believe anything if you indoctrinate them enough and they pay you money for the privilege MSmits.
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2020/08/24/some-americans-are-tragically-still-drinking-bleach-as-a-coronavirus-cure/?sh=7760f1d16748">https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2020/08/24/some-americans-are-tragically-still-drinking-bleach-as-a-coronavirus-cure/?sh=7760f1d16748</a>
 MSmits: seems real
 MSmits: yeah, i knew people believe stupid stuff... but to also have enough courage to try it when others say it kills you....
 MSmits: it's not just stupidity, it's also courage
 MSmits: or at least fearlessness if courage sounds too positive
 Stilgart: would be better to read/see bleach instead&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: I think lack of judgment separates courage from stupidity.
 MSmits: sounds like a reasonable definition in this case
 Astrobytes: Oh hey. Final score: 1685192238 | sims: 0
 MSmits: did people also put UV lights up the butt/? 
 MSmits: didnt he say that too?
 MSmits: what is that Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Up the arse? I thought it was in the throat.
 MSmits: i dunno, inside the body, can be various ways
 MSmits: but not an expert really
 Astrobytes: offline samegame solver MSmits. I strongly suspect I have created a bug.
 MSmits: yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: As a developper, that's your job Astrobytes...
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: monocolor samegame&#160;? :p
 MSmits: ahhhh thats it
 Astrobytes: It was working fine earlier...
 MSmits: you don't see color
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: colorblind samegame
 MSmits: be more racist
 Astrobytes: you bastards :D
 MSmits: eh colorist or whatever
 Astrobytes: My code is not colorblind, I'll have you know.
 MSmits: mine is, it only uses numbers
 Astrobytes: well yeah
 MSmits: there's the 0 ball and the 1 ball and the 2 ball
 Astrobytes: ball?
 MSmits: i dont even remember if they were round or square tbh
 jacek: hes shapeblind
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 MSmits: from your question i assume they were square
 MSmits:  lol
 VizGhar: :D
 MSmits: i had a crappy day at work today
 MSmits: had to do surveillance at a digital test
 Astrobytes: And for the record MSmits: I see all colors perfectly fine, I just have difficulty differentiating between particular variations of certain combinations of colours.
 MSmits: some computers took a full hour to log students in =/
 MSmits: Astrobytes ohh right you mean your eyes, wasnt even referring to that
 MSmits: that would be mean
 MSmits: would not make fun of someone's disability
 Astrobytes: Mean? Nah, everyone takes the piss for the colourblindness. I don't care :D
 MSmits: right jacek? I never did that to you either
 Astrobytes: Disability!
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: hey, i said I was *not* making fun :P
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: what is the color of a turtle&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i am just wondering if you can do
 Astrobytes: An hour to log in tho', for an actual exam?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well we switched a couple times
 MSmits: so in the end the worst off student had to wait 30 mins total
 MSmits: then she got to the end of her test
 MSmits: and it said,you have 10 nins to finish your work
 MSmits: computer is rebooting for an update
 MSmits: when she still had 2 questions to answer
 Stilgart: windows for the lose
 Astrobytes: Jeez
 MSmits: thankfully she could continue after reboot
 Astrobytes: Oh ok
 Astrobytes: Still not great for ones concentration 
 MSmits: it was pretty awful though, doing this job for 15 years now, never had technical problems this bad
 Stilgart: I got it a few times&#160;:(
 VizGhar: o.O mg... My students were taking test right during Google Big Crash :D funny event too, since we have everything in google services (classroom, mail, docs...)
 Astrobytes: I feel pretty bad for kids working through this past and continuing year
 MSmits: VizGhar i was teaching during crash also
 MSmits: but no test
 MSmits: they just started complaining about the school's internet and all that
 MSmits: but this time it was not the schools fault
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: You also teach?
 MSmits: it was actual google...
 VizGhar: sucks&#160;:|
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: yeap
 MSmits: we also do everything with google for students
 MSmits: with colleagues we use microsoft for some reason
 MSmits: no idea why it had to be different
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: what level?
 BlaiseEbuth: A right punishment for google's users&#160;! :imp:
 Stilgart: engineering school (bac+3/4)
 VizGhar: Yeah... well our licences for Microsoft expired and it looks like we will go for some linux distro
 MSmits: whats the 3/4?
 Stilgart: 3 and 4
 MSmits: linux?? what kind of school is this that you can switch to linux
 MSmits: you mean 3rd/4th year?
 Astrobytes: Nice. And why are you not tagged in the forum post about 'Community regular events'?
 BlaiseEbuth: It's the hogwarts number
 Stilgart: 9 less, actually
 Astrobytes: No that's 9 3/4
 MSmits: Astrobytes would know, it's in his country
 VizGhar: MSmits I honestly don't think it will happen&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I hate Harry Potter. There's actually a plaque on platform 9 that says Platform 9 3/4
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: maybe because I forgot about CG's forum twice every week
 MSmits: aw come on, thats cool Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: At Kings Cross station that is
 MSmits: did many people bang their heads against it?
 MSmits: bodyslammed it and such?
 MSmits: i mean if they drink bleach...
 Astrobytes: Stilgart:  Well, it was only posted today so... you should add yourself to the discussion.
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: ho, this thread
 BlaiseEbuth: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: Yes, I thought you might enjoy it.
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Probably.
 <b>**MSmits goes to youtube</b></p><p><img src="/a/51696362414566" /> VizGhar: Can somebody tell me what is last quest for Optimization path?
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: Discord =&gt; nope

 Stilgart: but I got blocked somewhere&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: Top 2% of code golf lb?
 Stilgart: I should talk about it to mouton5000
 Stilgart: he has at least to project that can be ported to CG
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: Well, the conversation will apparently be open here as well as discord so just post in the forum thread if you can't get on to discord.
 VizGhar: Yeah it's mentioned in the forum thread
 Astrobytes: I'm sure a benevolent user will bring across relevant points made on discord to the forum
 BlaiseEbuth: benewhat&#160;?
 Astrobytes: (as in not BlaiseEbuth :P )
 BlaiseEbuth: 'f course not
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Stilgart: anyway, i'd like to see an optimization contest
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah TGD2&#160;!
 Stilgart: why not a shortest code contest
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth throw 55 C chars on Stilgart.</b></p><p><img src="/a/36336680250371" /> blasterpoard: a*craft, but every char loses you 1 point?
 Stilgart: (with one big puzzle to solve)
 Stilgart: BlaiseEbuth: my trauma is beautiful
 darkhorse64: Why not give first prize to dbdr and skip contest&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: anyone seen dbdr btw?
 Stilgart: darkhorse64: not so sure about it
 Stilgart: but I might need to provide a referee myself
 darkhorse64: pardouin&#160;?
 darkhorse64: the master of random
 Stilgart: not hard to counter that
 Stilgart: in limited time with not so much room to cheat, dwarfie would perform well
 darkhorse64: More seriously, I'd like an optim contest. I root for dwarfie
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: ho, and to be honest, having a complete student team for the next contest is already a challenge&#160;:(
 Stilgart: so I am not "interested in having [...] something specific"&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: yes, I can understand that.
 reCurse:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: It's a start.
 zhoubou: What kind of combo of depth and turn per depth would you use for Code vs Zombies? I'm currently going 5 depth with 4 moves per depth and failing 6th test case with timeout. Also, I'm seeing 30% of time is wasted on calculating distances.
 BlaiseEbuth: use distance²
 zhoubou: I thought about storing distances, but how do I know zombie didn't turn somewhere else?
 zhoubou: Or did I misunderstand you?
 Astrobytes: instead of sqrt, just take the squared euclidean dist
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 zhoubou: Ah I see
 BlaiseEbuth: sqrt is slow, you can compare squared distances
 zhoubou: That makes sense, thanks!
 struct: zhoubou I search until game ends
 zhoubou: Oh ok
 struct: either no zombies or no humans
 zhoubou: Now that I know what can be done, my goal post has been moved&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Every day's a school day on CG 
 Astrobytes: Well, a few per week at least.
 BlaiseEbuth: Every day's St-Patrick's day&#160;!
 Astrobytes: But where are all the Irish people?
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not about Ireland, it's about beer&#160;!
 Astrobytes: :beers:
 BlaiseEbuth: :beers:
 karliso: Did any of you guys played AOE3?
 reCurse: Very briefly
 reCurse: AOE2 however
 karliso: Will you play aoe4?
 reCurse: Unlikely but we'll see
 Astrobytes: Didn't play much. My friend swears by AOE3 but he's younger than me so... go figure
 reCurse: AOE2 is timeless
 karliso: I wasted my youth playing AOE3.
 Heiwu: "homes" =)

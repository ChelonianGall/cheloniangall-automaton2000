 Lokesh_Shelva: how do u create a private clash
 Uljahn: oO
 Uljahn: Lokesh_Shelva: click "Start a private Clash" at the bottom of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a> page
 NasrAllah: by left clicking on clash page

 fyseus: how to deal with "Clash of Code is meant for human coders only, please prove you aren't a bot!"
 TFeld: click it
 fyseus: i find nothing to click:joy:
 Makiyu: hru guys?
 Uljahn: fyseus: to see the captcha you need to enable google services
 fyseus: ok,i will try it latter
 Uljahn: i guess it's blocked in china
 fyseus: yes, it's actually blocked..
 KP56: bruh
 derjack: oO
 Freeborn-coder: hello everyone, while taking the onboarding skill test, something important came up, i had to submit the test without answering anything. Can i take the test again?
 Nekko551XD: yes but it's puzzle so it doesn't matter how many times you retake it
 Nekko551XD: tries aren't limited by number nor time
 Lokesh_Shelva: is there a way for continue clash of code in private clash
 Lokesh_Shelva: or we have to start a new clash everytime?
 KP56: what is the shortest mode in COC about?
 Andriamanitra: it's about pain and suffering and losing to ruby and perl
 KP56: but
 KP56: what are the rules
 KP56: who wins
 Andriamanitra: whoever gets the highest percentage of tests correct using fewest characters
 KP56: ah ok
 Andriamanitra: i think time is used as tiebreaker if two people get for example 100% with 86 characters but it's mostly just about code golf tricks
 KP56: ah ok
 KP56: if the output has to be "true" can it be "True" too?
 Andriamanitra: nope
 KP56: bruh
 Andriamanitra: has to be exact
 Andriamanitra: the contribution guidelines say such outputs should be avoided but there are still plenty of bad clashes in circulation
 KP56: ah ok
 AntiSquid: anyone know a good paper on clashes?
 PoopyCoder123: what is a 'paper'
 leviisbadatvalorant: big boobs
 homo_sapien: yes

 sprkrd: good heavens, what's happening today?
 Wontonimo: what has become of world chat?  Oh, I miss the days of the last competition when intelligent conversation existed here
 sprkrd: the kick/ban festival, I assume
 Astrobytes: They're all kicked/banned
 macs_smells: poopoo
 leviisbadatvalorant: i did a code in 8 secs
 sprkrd: hey, there's a new one
 leviisbadatvalorant: 0%
 Wontonimo: nice leviisbadatvalorant , what was the challenge?
 Wontonimo: oh, 0%.  yeah, I too can get 0% in 8 sec lol
 sprkrd: AntiSquid what do you mean by "a good paper on clashes"?
 Wontonimo: I was going to ask the same&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I think it was a joke.
 fyseus: funny
 leviisbadatvalorant: why did macs_smells get banned&#160;?
 sprkrd: that was one of my two main assumptions
 Astrobytes: when you introduce yourself with "poopoo"...
 Astrobytes: And you're all from the same class...
 leviisbadatvalorant: unban him please
 Astrobytes: No.
 leviisbadatvalorant: tits
 leviisbadatvalorant: no
 leviisbadatvalorant: that was him
 Astrobytes: Bye bye
 Astrobytes: Now they're harassing me in DMs
 ashton642: wow
 sprkrd: oh god
 Wontonimo: sigh
 Astrobytes: Like I care.

 Astrobytes: he's banned now, was only kicked previously
 sprkrd: which age are these students? 9 years old?
 Astrobytes: I assume so. Mentally at least.
 Wontonimo: Do you have an option to temporarily stop new joiners from joining world chat?  Or target a whole IP range?
 MrRin: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + thrust)
 Astrobytes: No. And that would also ruin it for the other students who aren't spamming
 MrRin: Sorry, sent in wrong palce
 sprkrd: i'm thinking if they're doing an assignment, probably they don't need the chat anyway
 Wontonimo: looks like you are exchanging notes on now to play Coders Strikes Back MrRin 
 Astrobytes: There are a lot of features missing from the web chat, it't never gonna be fixed or updated though sadly.
 Wontonimo: agreed sprkrd
 Astrobytes: *it's
 PoopyCoder123: astrobytes why did you kick me
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you occasionally get the odd one who asks a pertinent question in chat
 Wontonimo: first, check out your user name
 PoopyCoder123: my username is completely appropriate
 PoopyCoder123: oh damn 500th thats insane
 Astrobytes: also "my ass" wasn't a particularly endearing thing to say was it?
 Wontonimo: next, reconsider that statement
 PoopyCoder123: all right im sorry
 PoopyCoder123: but i will become first one day
 Astrobytes: cool, lets move on
 Wontonimo: are you working on Coders Strikes Back&#160;?
 PoopyCoder123: whats that
 Wontonimo: what are you working in here?
 PoopyCoder123: just clash of code?
 sprkrd: I believe this gentleman is not from the students group, Wontonimo
 PoopyCoder123: whats the student's group?
 PoopyCoder123: because im a student
 Wontonimo: there are gentlemen here?  lol
 Astrobites: YOOOO
 Astrobytes: 0/10 for originality
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt;
 PoopyCoder123: Oh my astrobytes is 285
 PoopyCoder123: thats even more insane
 Wontonimo: wow Astrobytes, I see two of you.  it's just sooooo confusing.   I can't tell who is who .... is it you with rank 27600000th or the one with the moderator icon&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: 285th&#160;:(I need to fix that
 PoopyCoder123: :joy:
 PoopyCoder123: btw what is coder's strike back
 PoopyCoder123: it seems interesting
 KP56: its a game you can bot on this website
 Wontonimo: Change your name please then I'll tell you.  it is cool
 KP56: its about racing
 Astrobytes: A multiplayer bot programming game
 PoopyCoder123: how to change name
 Wontonimo: top right
 Astrobytes: Settings
 KP56: imagine calling yourself "poopy"
 KP56: couldnt be me
 ChickenCoder123: right ok i changed it
 ChickenCoder123: so a multiplayer bot programming game?
 Wontonimo: sigh ... my rank just keeps dropping.  It would go back up if I jumped on CoC, but that's a hamster wheel I'm giving up on 
 Wontonimo: Nice new name ChickenCoder123
 Wontonimo: yeah i'll get a link for you
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 Astrobytes: Only temporarily though Wontonimo. Not worth the effort imo
 ChickenCoder123: wait the rank is more than just clash of code?
 Astrobytes: Yes. I don't clash at all.
 ChickenCoder123: oh
 KiwiTae: clash of code gives u up to 5000pts
 Wontonimo: yes, Clash of Code is only a very very small part of rank
 KiwiTae: so small
 Astrobytes: oh hey KiwiTae
 sprkrd: you could just try to reach gold in every multi, Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: tiny even
 Wontonimo: I'm going for Legend sprkrd :D
 Astrobytes: Legend or delete :D
 sprkrd: Sure, like everyone
 Wontonimo: 100%
 ChickenCoder123: just wait a week ill be up to top 1000
 Wontonimo: do it ChickenCoder123&#160;!  I support your ambition
 KiwiTae: im going for silver in coders of caribbean &gt;&lt; will see
 KiwiTae: ChickenCoder123 good luck
 sprkrd: but if you're concerned about the rank mainly, you can set gold in every multi as a first stop
 ChickenCoder123: what is multi
 sprkrd: activities&gt;compete&gt;bot programming
 sprkrd: those are multiplayer games
 Wontonimo: i'm unconcerned about rank
 sprkrd: ah, then all is good
 ChickenCoder123: wise indeed
 Wontonimo: ChickenCoder123 Coders Strikes Back is a "multi" <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back</a>
 ChickenCoder123: ah i see
 ja_fica: Connect4 is cool if you want to try
 Wontonimo: Show us your stuff ChickenCoder123 and get to Bronze in Coders Strikes Back.  You should be able to get there by just flying straight at the checkpoint and slowing down a bit when you are within 1000 of it
 Wontonimo: I haven't started on Connect4 yet.  Started porting my UTTT code, but then got distracted with work
 sprkrd: stupid work
 sprkrd: always distracting from the important things
 ja_fica: code transfer from UTTT works pretty well
 ja_fica: But in connect for you can predict up to 3 plays ahead for each node while UTTT I can only predict the next one
 ja_fica: *C4
 ja_fica: Binary tricks for life
 ChickenCoder123: I was too confused for connect 4
 ChickenCoder123: i didnt know what to do apart from not placing it on a full column
 sprkrd: but you do know now?
 ja_fica: Its good to apply simulation on a time bukket
 ja_fica: minmax or MTCS are greate
 ja_fica: *great
 ja_fica: or both (MTCS solver - better version)
 Wontonimo: I agree sprkrd , work is such a drag 
 ChickenCoder123: hey um for the coders stikes back thing can the angle of the next checkpoint be negative?
 sprkrd: yup
 sprkrd: it's between -180 and 180
 ChickenCoder123: oh that makes sense
 sprkrd: the ranges of the inputs should be at the end of the statement
 General_Imaginaer: Hello World
 sprkrd: yo, my favorite rammstein fan
 General_Imaginaer: nahhh , iam not a special rammstein fan i am only a fan of music&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I love Rammstein
 Astrobytes: And music, generally
 General_Imaginaer: I love all kind of Music .. i think it depends on the emotione i have or i want.
 General_Imaginaer: emotione=mood
 Astrobytes: I agree
 sprkrd: all kinds? really?
 sprkrd: i'm good at finding counterexamples
 General_Imaginaer: yeah no joke , i can hear all if i am in mood ^^
 Astrobytes: I'm not a fan of classical opera. I think that's about it
 darkhorse64: chvrches, a nice scottish band
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes, they're pretty good
 General_Imaginaer: let me check that :P

 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWVUp12XPpU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWVUp12XPpU</a>
 sprkrd: John Cage, 4'33<i></i>
 darkhorse64: I have heard there will be a new album (not the compilation). Also a new single with Robert Smith
 General_Imaginaer: chvrches dont sound bad ^^
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh the 4'33 ^^
 Astrobytes: with Robert Smith! Nice
 Astrobytes: lol, classic
 darkhorse64: Their first album is still the best for me
 darkhorse64: Others are fine though
 General_Imaginaer: @sprkrd ok i test that ^^
 Wontonimo: Hey ChickenCoder123, you submitted a bot!  Good for you, and you've already got out of wood 3 and 2
 Astrobytes: Can't say I disagree there darkhorse64
 General_Imaginaer: why i have the feeling they dont will play sound xD?!
 sprkrd: :D
 sprkrd: It's 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence
 Astrobytes: *ambience
 General_Imaginaer: i like that ... but i would not buy the cd ^^
 Astrobytes: what did he call it? Unintentional sounds only, as all sound can be considered music
 BlaiseEbuth: General_Imaginaer <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It5vKbJvgmw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It5vKbJvgmw</a>

 General_Imaginaer: lol @blaiseebuth, thats a good song and a good interpretation :P
 BlaiseEbuth: The yodle is fire. ^^
 General_Imaginaer:  ^^
 General_Imaginaer: good in combination with some beer
 General_Imaginaer: rofl  .... for the next celebration i need all songs from this dudes :P

 Astrobytes: Nice!
 Astrobytes: I like their stuff

 General_Imaginaer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Dls5kugck">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Dls5kugck</a> Sounds a little bit like  a death metal singer xD
 General_Imaginaer: after 0:50
 Astrobytes: General_Imaginaer: check the Hu that BlaiseEbuth mentioned, they do metal stuff with throat singing
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 General_Imaginaer: ok the last , i need to solve some puzzles :O)
 General_Imaginaer: yeah , they come in my muscle training set   xD
 General_Imaginaer: playlist
 General_Imaginaer: Ok thanks for all this new music ... new was to torture my friends  :P
 General_Imaginaer: wys
 darkhorse64: chvrches is not torture more heavenly stuff
 Astrobytes: yeah, Lauren has a lovely voice
 General_Imaginaer: all of this songs was not realy torture ... that is that what i mean its mutch about mood and the mood you want ... you own experience and more ...
 General_Imaginaer: its like colors ... we interpret it ... , and some pictures are cool other are realy bad
 General_Imaginaer: but you will find for every bad picture someone who would say that is nice
 Astrobytes: Sure, one persons trash is anothers treasure
 General_Imaginaer: right
 General_Imaginaer: and find a good chartbreaker song is like find a song that the most of people like
 Astrobytes: that's a whole other discussion :P
 General_Imaginaer: hehe
 kyoya34: hello
 nickeyminasj: hi
 nickeyminasj: thoughts on pineapple on pixxa?
 Uljahn: ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i'm doing the coders strike back?
 Brejchys: how can I play the card games?
 ChickenCoder123: hey guys for coders strick back how long does the boost last?
 Wontonimo: 1 turn i thought
 ChickenCoder123: how long is that?
 ChickenCoder123: is one turn like one loop?
 Wontonimo: 1 step.  just 1.
 Brejchys: well, how do you make it to go only once?
 ChickenCoder123: if i play with 100 thrust for just one turn how far in pixels will that get me
 Wontonimo: it depends what your previous speed was
 KP56: let me calculate
 Wontonimo: because there is drag
 KP56: if your initial speed is 0
 Uljahn: boost is 650 thrust
 Wontonimo: i think the info in the write up explains the exact calculation 
 KP56: i think it will get you around 400-500 units forward
 ChickenCoder123: in wood 1 league, (where i am right now) all it says is that you can use boost to increase speed just once
 KP56: yes
 ChickenCoder123: oh thanks k056
 ChickenCoder123: kp56*
 KP56: yes but it will keep doing it for a while
 KP56: it will take around 5 loops
 KP56: to move 400-500 units
 KP56: if you keep applying 100 thrust during them
 KP56: it will be even more
 ChickenCoder123: oh
 KP56: the best way to use boost would be to store all distances between checkpoints during the first lap and then just use it once you pass the one which there is the highest distance to the next one
 KP56: i dont know if it makes sense
 ChickenCoder123: yeah right now all i have is the distance to the next checkpoint
 KP56: and checkpointX and checkpointY
 KP56: right?
 ChickenCoder123: yeah
 ChickenCoder123: only next_checkpoint x and y btw
 KP56: in c++ its called differentely
 ChickenCoder123: oh
 KP56: store the shortest distance in a variable and a pair of checpointX and checkpointY and if the distance you find is lower than the one which is in the variable then override that pair of coordinates with the one which you are presented during that loop
 KP56: you can also keep track of all pairs and if you find a duplicate, it means that you have completed the first lap
 KP56: and then you just wait until you pass the checkpoint before the one you have saved
 KP56: and you use boost
 ChickenCoder123: yeah that makes sense
 ChickenCoder123: i guess theres some small details i might have to worry about
 ChickenCoder123: for example if there are two or three checkpoints with same distance between each other
 KP56: then it doesnt matter
 KP56: your program will save the first one
 KP56: and since its the same distance it doesnt matter which one you use boost for
 KP56: you need to make sure the angle is low before you use boost
 ChickenCoder123: it might in the sense that the program will think one loop is finished when in fact we havent finished a lap and there is a checkpoint with higher distance
 Wontonimo: have either of you heard of the -3v algo for Coders Strikes Back&#160;?
 KP56: yeah
 KP56: i tried it out and got to silver
 KP56: it was my own implementation of it, there may be a room for optimization
 KP56: and i calculated velocity and used it instead of thrust
 Wontonimo: it'll get you to gold without much alteration
 KP56: for now im working on a simulation
 KP56: it would be a very simple one - no collisions just thrust
 Wontonimo: how about you ChickenCoder123, have you heard about the -3v algo?
 ChickenCoder123: nah
 ChickenCoder123: literally just started this
 ChickenCoder123: but don't tel me about it
 Wontonimo: ok
 Wontonimo: but i already did
 Wontonimo: lol
 ChickenCoder123: like dont tell me how it works
 KP56: i was about to
 KP56: lmao
 KP56: if you run a simulation it will perform better than it and at some point you will need to implement a simulation
 KP56: so it wouldnt be a huge problem
 Wontonimo: i will tell you this, go to the leaderboard and watch replays of people who are beating you or who are way higher than you.  Turn on debug and watch how they are different.
 KP56: i mean the name of this algho speaks for itself lmao
 ChickenCoder123: i haven't actually played in arena too much yet cos i was eating dinner
 KP56: im wondering if you can get to legend without predicting collisions
 Wontonimo: you can
 KP56: oh nice
 KP56: if thats the case, if i didnt mess anything up, i should be there in like an hour
 Wontonimo: with 5 look aheads for checkpoint touching only
 KP56: oh ok
 KP56: i was thinking about simulating entire laps (once i pass the first one so i know all checkpoint positions)
 KP56: and since im coding it in c++, it should be efficient enough to not get a timeout
 KP56: can anyone tell me why there is an error in this c++ class?
 KP56: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb39859c-57c9-45ca-9c92-2a1f56872c17">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb39859c-57c9-45ca-9c92-2a1f56872c17</a>
 KP56: it keeps telling me my constructor should initialize location
 Wontonimo: I just looked at your current replay KP56 and you arn't using -3v
 Uljahn: don't spend much efforts in silver, gold rules are very different
 KP56: yeah im not because i ran just 100 thrust last time
 KP56: to see how far i can get lmao
 Wontonimo: well you are not initializing location
 KP56: i am in the constructor
 KP56: but it keeps telling me my constructor does not do it
 Wontonimo: where in the code are you calling the constructor?
 Wontonimo: okay, now's the time I admit my c++ ignorance.  I just hack c++
 kyoya34: hello
 struct: he is not calling it, but he has the constructor there
 struct: is the Checkpoint(Point location)
 Astrobytes: I think he means where in the rest of his code is he calling it&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Maybe he's just doing Checkpoint cp; since there's no default constructor that might do it

 Max98: why are all the private clash of code games so much easier then the public ones? And why can't you just hit play again?
 KP56: what changes in gold in coders strike back?
 Astrobytes: Most of the inputs
 Astrobytes: Unfortunately.
 KP56: you dont get nextCheckpointAngle?
 Brejchys: wtf is this
 struct: you do
 Brejchys: coders strike back
 Brejchys: my speed doesnt change
 Brejchys: at all
 Astrobytes: You do. You get a lot more additional info too.
 struct: But you get all checkpoints at the start of the game
 Astrobytes: And velocity etc
 Dragon84: Hey guys
 Astrobytes: hi
 KP56: oh i used to calculate velocity by hand
 KP56: good to know
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's rather annoying.

 Brejchys: it caltulates but doesnt show anything
 struct: refresh the page
 struct: I thing its a bug
 MiyamuraIzumi: ha ha
 MiyamuraIzumi: hi guys
 struct: hi
 fyseus: hi
 Brejchys: yes
 Brejchys: was a bug
 MiyamuraIzumi: :confused:
 MiyamuraIzumi: :kiss_ww:
 Brejchys: i think i just defeated boss 3
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: which game?
 Brejchys: coders strike back
 Brejchys: yes
 tommaso.castello: Rn i'm 2nd in silver and I'm waiting to be promoted in gold in coders strike back
 MiyamuraIzumi: a lot of new comer for csb
 MiyamuraIzumi: congratulate
 tommaso.castello: ty 
 Brejchys: i am getting better every second
 Brejchys: in bronze tho
 tommaso.castello: I made it from bronze to gold without changing the code  
 Brejchys: lol?
 Brejchys: i mean
 Brejchys: it does make sense
 Brejchys: since most of the game seems like about the best way to use your speed to your advantage
 Brejchys: so
 Brejchys: if you can do that you can probably push far
 tommaso.castello: yes, silver only adds the shield but not even the boss uses it lol
 Brejchys: what is a shield?
 tommaso.castello: when you activate it, the engine stops for three cycles but if someone gets on you it is thrown farther
 Brejchys: ahhh
 Brejchys: so it sounds strong
 Brejchys: if it sends him away from his next target
 tommaso.castello: The problem is, you don't know if you are helping him or not
 Brejchys: you probably can figure it out
 Brejchys: based on your x,y
 struct: its not very usefull on silver
 Brejchys: his x,y
 Brejchys: and next checkpoint x,y
 struct: you only need shield at top legend
 Brejchys: right?
 tommaso.castello: yeah 
 Brejchys: does it make sense to ever go 0 speed?
 Brejchys: i dont think so :D
 tommaso.castello: i just go always at 100
 Brejchys: really?
 Brejchys: thats pretty stupid i think
 Brejchys: i mean
 Brejchys: you need to slow down before a checkpoint
 Brejchys: to maximize your results
 tommaso.castello: i turn before the checkpoint
 Brejchys: ohhh
 Brejchys: you can see where next checkpoint will be?
 Brejchys: like if you are going to 2nd you can see 3rd x,y:
 Brejchys:&#160;?
 tommaso.castello: no but i remember them for the 2nd lap
 Brejchys: oh shit
 Brejchys: thats some next level
 tommaso.castello: ty 
 Brejchys: is there always 4 checkpoints?
 tommaso.castello: nope 
 Brejchys: but is it always the same?
 Brejchys: or dynamic?
 tommaso.castello: dynamic 
 Brejchys: oh
 Brejchys: so how do you remember them?
 tommaso.castello: when i see that nextX changes i save them in an array 
 tommaso.castello: when i see that nextCheckpointX c
 tommaso.castello: ops 
 Brejchys:&#160;?
 Brejchys: right
 Brejchys: thats really cool
 tommaso.castello: I save the x and y values of the checkpoint when I see them change and when the value is equal to the first I know that I have done the first lap
 Brejchys: i understand
 Brejchys: sorry for the&#160;?
 tommaso.castello: np
 Wontonimo: hey, congrats on getting to 2nd place in Silver tommaso.castello
 tommaso.castello: Ty 
 Brejchys: what time can you get to better league?
 tommaso.castello: 1 min and 12 sec
 Brejchys: so you have to be 1st or 2nd for 1 min and 12 sec?
 tommaso.castello: no untill 17:16 for some reasons 
 Brejchys: oh what
 Brejchys: so the next time i can get better is tommorow?
 tommaso.castello: idk the time changes 
 Wontonimo: it says at the top of your IDE
 tommaso.castello: for gold leage is at 23:14 now 
 KiwiTae:  Brejchys nah once your bot settles above  the boss , you just need to wait, no matter the results of new battles
 KP56: who wants to play in a private clash
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: it's against my religion
 Wontonimo: or I need to walk my dog
 ChickenCoder123: hey um i dont get it im winning against this boss but im still not going into the next league
 KP56: it is possible
 Wontonimo: oh?
 Wontonimo: your battles have to finish
 KP56: some algorithms are better against the bot itself and others against other players
 KP56: has happened to me before
 Wontonimo: and the timer in your IDE may say it can take a few minutes or hours
 ChickenCoder123: which timer
 KP56: on top of your screen there will be atimer if you can get to the next league
 Wontonimo: you are not better than the boss
 Wontonimo: submit to arena and you have to beat all the people in your league and the boss
 ChickenCoder123: oh ok
 Wontonimo: you probably only beat the boss in "play my code"
 ChickenCoder123: yeah
 Wontonimo: but you have to beat everyone in "test in arena"
 Wontonimo: cool!
 ChickenCoder123: are they different bosses?
 Wontonimo: nope, same boss, but "test in arena" will make your bot play dozens of games, and it has to win more on average against the boss and the other top players for you to get promoted
 Wontonimo: not just 1 win
 ChickenCoder123: i see..
 Wontonimo: win on average
 ChickenCoder123: wait i was rated 200 and i just dropped to 950 in like seconds
 Wontonimo: yup, happens 
 Wontonimo: your ranking is based on your win/loss - 3 * standard deviation of your win/loss
 ChickenCoder123: bruhh how do you know this
 Wontonimo: if your bot is inconsistent it will rank lower than a similar win/loss bot that is consistent
 Wontonimo: i hang out in world chat a lot
 Wontonimo: and talk to the mods
 Wontonimo: nicely&#160;;)
 ChickenCoder123: lmao
 NasrAllah: where i can find
 NasrAllah: leaderboards
 NasrAllah: okay found it thanks

 BlaiseEbuth: for?
 derjack: while!
 Astrobytes: do while!!
 BlaiseEbuth: li = [1, 2, 4, 6]
 SubwayMan: Hi, what's the proper keybind for copy pasting from vim mode in editor?
 SubwayMan: "*y is not working for me, and neither is the typical ctrl C
 BlaiseEbuth: :help
 BlaiseEbuth: and then rtfm
 BlaiseEbuth: :p
 derjack: vim is so addictive. i cant quit&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 BlaiseEbuth: is :help working&#160;?
 SubwayMan: Doesn't seem to be
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway tha depend of your mode
 SubwayMan: yeah I tried it in visual mode
 SubwayMan: as well as normal
 KP56: VIM is the only proper IDE
 struct: When i activate vim by mistake the only way to get out is to shutdown the computer
 KP56: even though it's not an IDE
 KP56: everything else is inefficient
 SubwayMan: @struct just :q!
 BlaiseEbuth: in visual mode once the text selected the default copy key is y
 SubwayMan: or :wq
 KP56: vim is the only one which doesnt require you to use mouse
 KP56: to edit
 KP56: so its the best one
 struct: I like my mouse
 SubwayMan: @BlaiseEbuth yes but that doesn't copy to clipboard I believe
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope
 SubwayMan: typically the copy to clipboard command is "*y
 KP56: @struct your mouse slows you down - learn how to use vim
 SubwayMan: but that doesn't seem to work :grimacing:
 struct: no thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: vim vanilla does not copy to clipboard 
 KP56: imagine having to copy
 KP56: couldnt be me
 BlaiseEbuth: Without extra config the copy-pasting is only in vim
 BlaiseEbuth: So if CG haven't done such config...
 SubwayMan: really? I believe the typical behaviour is that "*y should copy to the register specified, in this case the clipboard
 BlaiseEbuth: Not sure...
 BlaiseEbuth: Last time I used vim I had to configure it for that.
 KP56: as far as i know copying is unnecessary
 KP56: as it requires you to imput 2 EXTRA CHARACTERS
 SubwayMan: cool story bro
 struct: *y copies all?
 SubwayMan: I just wanted to take some code that I wrote for a puzzle and test it on my own machine
 SubwayMan: *y still doesn't copy to clipboard unlucky
 struct: so what does it do?
 SubwayMan: it copies to vim's local register or somethingso you can place it again with p
 SubwayMan: but it isn't saved to clipboard
 BlaiseEbuth: For that precise case, just use right-click...
 SubwayMan: @BlaseEbuth I'm looking at my vimrc right now and I'm not seeing any copy paste configs
 SubwayMan: yeah I can use right clickbut using the mouse to copy feels so gross lol
 SubwayMan: I don't understand why there isn't a quick command for copying to clipboard, oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm you're right. My config was to use clipboard by default, and so with y and not *y.
 QuickMathzs: take a look
 QuickMathzs: its in a book
 QuickMathzs: reading RAINBOWWW
 derjack: oO
 dbdr: " Use the system clipboardset clipboard=unnamedplus
 derjack: could be another NN in oware? :thinking:

 dbdr: jolindien?
 derjack: maybe
 derjack: anyone higher than msmits is nn no?
 jolindien: salut
 jolindien: dbdr&#160;?

 dbdr: nice, thanks!
 jolindien: 2 good links&#160;:)
 jolindien: nice c++ code
 jolindien: his NN is so much more efficient than mine
 derjack: still below than marchete
 BlaiseEbuth: as above so below
 Astrobytes: the Oware NN battle escalates again eh
 struct: yeah, keep them away from c4
 derjack: then ill write article about NN for c4 :imp:
 struct: I feel like robo has the same problem that re curse had on Spring challenge
 struct: where vs weaker bots it struggles
 LazyMammal: NN aren't really smart.  They just learn a bunch of patterns (and slightly generalize from that).  If you don't train it, it can't learn it!
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC just sent the emails to claim prizes - just 6 months after the contest
 LazyMammal: So it's a good idea to train NN against really bad, some random and the NN previous best.  Only replace best when it can beat all of the above.
 eulerscheZahl: they get faster :o
 Smelty: gasp
 Astrobytes: ah yes, thanks euler, just received it
 Wontonimo: +1 LazyMammal
 Smelty: +1
 derjack: -1
 eulerscheZahl: pro tip: order the hoodie 1 size larger than the tshirt
 Astrobytes: I was expecting to wait until november
 Smelty: hm
 Wontonimo: well, you're just -1 because you are upside down derjack
 Astrobytes: I only got t-shirt&#160;:(
 Smelty: loll
 <b>**eulerscheZahl inserts "it's something" meme</b></p><p><img src="/a/64869146225502" /> derjack: welp alphazero doesnt use pitting like alphago zero does
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: i remember from Marchets writeup that he keeps the last 3 iirc, and only promotes if &gt;55% win 
 derjack: good for him
 Wontonimo: you could just expand that to last 30 and only if &gt;55% win on all 
 Wontonimo: or instead all previous and just ladder them like CG does
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: dice duel  referee does funny stuff with the player score (-1 when you run out of dice, counts dice twice). should I make a patch for it?
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 derjack:  blame the approvers
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a replay to illustrate the problem?
 eulerscheZahl: why do I always make these stupid bugs in my contributions?&#160;:(
 derjack: and why approvers dont see then
 dbdr: it does not appear in a replay, just if you use the CG apie.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/blob/f9a4a1c945dda326c56fc28b089818844bf40606/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L47">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/blob/f9a4a1c945dda326c56fc28b089818844bf40606/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L47</a>
 dbdr: leads to a -1 score, should be 0 I would say
 dbdr: also each dice is counted twice&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: moderation guidelines are pretty lax for approvers. you aren't supposed to read the code
 derjack: phew
 dbdr: because the score is already set, then you add it a second time
 derjack: so all blame comes from the contributor
 dbdr: that's cosmetic, just means 6 to 4 dice shows up as 12 - 8
 dbdr: the -1 is more annoying, looks like a timeout
 eulerscheZahl: i see. PRs are welcome. otherwise i'll do something about it myself
 eulerscheZahl: i never noticed because there is no endscreen
 eulerscheZahl: but it can confuse 3rd party tools such as brutaltester and cg-benchmark
 dbdr: when speech synthesis for the end "screen"?
 dbdr: need a new challenge after 3d&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and allow every user to upload a sound file with the own username
 Astrobytes: jeez :D
 dbdr: LD
 eulerscheZahl: is basically i'd just have to change line 36 toplayer.setScore(0)
 dbdr: with a flag
 KP56: wait
 KP56: in gold league in coders strike back i control 2 PODS?
 eulerscheZahl: and not undo the crashed status
 dbdr: a real timeout should be -1
 eulerscheZahl: could add the crashed status as extra argument to lostGame()
 eulerscheZahl: intelliJ is open
 derjack: KP56 yes
 eulerscheZahl: should work, right?

 eulerscheZahl: oh wait no. still have to consider the no-moves case
 Nekko551XD: for bot games does it take one input in time limit or it can change depending on the number of calculations program can make in that time limit
 LazyMammal: all the bot multi games are turn-based
 Astrobytes: Each iteration of the main loop is a turn. All inputs are read, you have n ms to 'think' and output one move per iteration.
 LazyMammal: And no, preloading future moves. And you can't bank time.
 Nekko551XD: I got it, thanks  
 LazyMammal: First turn is usually 1000ms and other turns 50ms.  So you can pre-calc stuff but your bot will have to queue it up in bot memory only.
 KP56: is there a memory limit?
 KP56: int a[100000000] :D
 eulerscheZahl: 768MB

 Monicka: m not sure who should I ASK
 eulerscheZahl: explain it in short here

 eulerscheZahl: we might tell you to contact Thibaud depending on the issue
 Monicka: the problem is that I've created my account with facebook and my email used there isn't available anymore, and I m not able to change neither my email nor my password
 Monicka: cause I don't have the email to reset the password
 Monicka: and I didn
 Monicka: t remember my password because I ve used to log in with my facebook account

 Monicka: I will try there then
 eulerscheZahl: there is some combination of setting your email and using the forgot password link, isn't there?
 Monicka: thanks
 Monicka: i didn t  find this combination
 eulerscheZahl: others managed to change their login to password on their own

 Astrobytes: KiwiTae: Yeah, fractured part of my wrist and bottom part of my hand
 eulerscheZahl: did you punch something?
 KiwiTae: :worried: patpat 
 Astrobytes: No, then I would have broken knuckles!
 Astrobytes: And it's my left hand.
 eulerscheZahl: also sorry dbdr, I'm about to break your bot

 eulerscheZahl: did you only do it for the first cell? because you could visit any cell multiple times
 dbdr: only first, yes

 struct: thanks for the push :D
 struct: Now I can ditch this game
 YurkovAS: :tada:
 jacek: uh oh someone needs to update his book
 Marchete: connect 4 is good for NN or not jacek?
 jacek: i use NN
 jacek: but locally i have some rps issues
 Marchete: rps?
 struct: rock paper scisor
 jacek: i have something that wins 70% but is weaker overall
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: wait, struct beats Smits?!
 struct: I got pushed
 struct: check last battles :p
 Marchete: do you have 50GB of books too?
 struct: no book
 struct: ok my book is play move 2 on first turn
 struct: or w/e it is
 Marchete: pure AVX raw power then?
 struct: I use avx to get winning moves
 struct: and to check for wins
 struct: The check for wins is not really needed but I never finished the other version
 Marchete: why it isn't needed?
 struct: if you check if opponent has 2 winning moves
 struct: you lose
 struct: or if the move that you can play to prevent him from winning also makes him win
 struct: So you dont really need to check for a win
 Marchete: so you play to avoid the enemy win?
 darkhorse64: in playouts
 Marchete: I've heard that on infinite connect4
 struct: yes in rollouts as darkhorse said
 jacek: infinite connect4?

 Marchete: you can ask smits to pay 26 eur
 jacek: it says 30.69 eur
 jacek: did he see that
 Marchete: that must be theorical stuff
 Marchete: like just creating patterns
 Marchete: but most literature talks and use minimax. Not a lot of MCTS
 geppoz: well I brought MCTS in JS in top 15 :D
 geppoz: shame on me?
 Marchete: this is madness
 struct: how many rollouts geppoz?
 Marchete: 3
 struct: lol
 geppoz: at first turns 1000
 geppoz: at mid game 5000-7000
 geppoz: got a bit of improvement with tree reuse
 geppoz: moving root down and continuing from existing tree
 geppoz: I have a last optimization to do, hoping get top 10
 geppoz: then porting in c++&#160;;)
 struct: you could also try adding mcts solver
 struct: but im not sure if it will help
 geppoz: done
 struct: ah you have solver?
 geppoz: y
 geppoz: well at first I "invented" the solver
 geppoz: :D
 geppoz: by pruning out the math wins and losses
 geppoz: then MSmits teached me the "solver" existance
 geppoz: so I learnt the theory
 struct: I see
 struct: I also learned the theory from the chat
 struct: Then I tried reading the code that is in the paper
 struct: and was confused
 geppoz: uh same, bad code, but theory is ok
 geppoz: btu it is missing the "draw" part
 PranavVK: what am i supposed to do about the security check? where i prove im not a bot?
 Nekko551XD: does that pop up a lot for you&#160;?
 PranavVK: first time, altho its just my second day of playing
 PranavVK: ive played alot today though
 Nekko551XD: the reason may be because you keep multiple codingame pages open in tabs
 PranavVK: nah i only got 1
 PranavVK: Security CheckClash of Code is meant for human coders only, please prove you aren't a bot!
 PranavVK: there's nowhere for me to prove
 Nekko551XD: just reload page
 PranavVK: yeah the captcha showed up now thanks lol
 PranavVK: i even exited the page and came back and it didnt work
 Nekko551XD: not sure why after all i am not expert here XD
 Nekko551XD: hf playing
 PranavVK: lol thanks
 envifly: coc grind
 adila: a lot of the puzzles here are put in the wrong category IMHO
 FBF_Luis: I have a question. I just finished my first weekly but it really needs some optimizing. Can I submit now and change it later? Or once it's submitted I can't change it anymore?
 therealbeef: you can always resubmit
 FBF_Luis: ok, thanks&#160;:)
 therealbeef: submissions get stored on the server as well
 FBF_Luis: oh cool, so I can see it even next week for example
 therealbeef: yes, when you open a puzzle or multi the next time it shows the code that you last submitted
 therealbeef: and there's a history of all submits too, when you check the 'results' on the left there is a history tab
 FBF_Luis: yes, I had already noticed that, but I didn't know if it was the same for weekly problems
 therealbeef: oh, the 'weekly' is just a label put on one of the existing puzzles or multis. it doesn't change anything about them
 therealbeef: one of the CG guys picks a puzzle to put in the spotlight for a week
 PranavVK: am i blind or does anyone know where i go to try to make a coding puzzle of my own
 PranavVK: or challenge or whatever it's called
 PranavVK: nvm i am blind, i found it

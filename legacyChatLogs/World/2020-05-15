 jrke: hey how can we command dead pacs
 njaber: you can't?
 jrke: so can we see pellets that our dead pellets can see
 njaber: you can't
 jrke: so what can dead pacs do
 eulerscheZahl: they are just there so you know you killed them
 njaber: nothing, they send the information to you for decdution
 jrke: means no use just to show how many of our pacs died
 Neabfi: yeah and to know how many enemy pacs are dead too
 eulerscheZahl: and where they died
 jrke: K
 jrke: means they can't see anything
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 njaber: indeed
 jrke: thanks&#160;:)
 mohammadhei05: shut
 Zenoscave: shut what
 mohammadhei05: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b836d157-e1b9-4670-9657-94441dc09bb0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b836d157-e1b9-4670-9657-94441dc09bb0</a>
 mohammadhei05: give me code
 Zenoscave: no
 Zenoscave: do your own homework
 cegprakash: anyone doing depth 30?
 cegprakash: :D
 mohammadhei05: ok
 mohammadhei05: :joy:
 njaber: cegprakash I'm curious, when you're talking about depth, do you mean depth in number of turns, or in number of moves?
 cegprakash: turns
 cegprakash: ofc
 Zenoscave: Does speed count as 1 or two turns?
 cegprakash: 1
 njaber: so top gold are doing 20-30 turns...
 njaber: I need to find the answer to my problem quickly so I can implement it
 Kellthazar: I want to hit gold to tried on Monte Carlo Tree Search again...
 Kellthazar: to try*
 Zenoscave: Kellthazar why not try it now
 Csipcsirip: MCTS works pretty good if you  combine it with a strong rollout heuristics
 BenWo: I cannot get up the motivation to code tonight :P
 Neabfi: yeah MCTS should guarantee you at least top 200 gold 
 Kellthazar: Csiripcsirip, but how to use a heuristic to make the random moves? This part is not clear to me.
 Neabfi: I never implemented a MCTS on CG, I feel like it is not as simple to make it so that there are enough playout in 50ms
 Csipcsirip: you only count moves in your random generator that makes sense. for example you dont go left right left right left right
 cegprakash: I win against someone almost everytime on IDE but I lost 0-5 to him on arena
 thethiny: randomness ftw
 SurajMishra2209: I am still stuck at bronze...type F in chat
 JohnCM: ya i'm a strong believer of monte carlo tree search too
 JohnCM: just not for codingame, the timeout is killer
 JohnCM: if it's 1 pac vs 1 pac still got chance
 JohnCM: but the monte carlo complexity is exponential in the number of agents
 JohnCM: as you need to multiply num actions per agent * num agent per time step
 JohnCM: and it quickly explodes to 4 moves per agent per 10 agents (including opponent) = 4^10 calculations per time step
 JohnCM: that is just only assuming up down left right
 Csipcsirip: you can have a separate tree for every pacman
 JohnCM: if you include speed and transform, there'll be more actions
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax</a>
 JohnCM: well that won't be very accurate if we assume that the other agents are part of the environment
 AntiSquid: did you see the player count euler? 5605
 eulerscheZahl: wait, what?
 AntiSquid: 4605 *
 Csipcsirip: you run every pacman in the same env
 eulerscheZahl: was 4.5k
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 AntiSquid: but it's bigger than accountant
 eulerscheZahl: still: all-time highest :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: might even reach the 5k mark
 JohnCM: hmm i guess smitsimax might make a good approx. if you know your enemy posit
 Csipcsirip: I don't count enemy at all yet. except I reset pellets, that are 100% eaten by him
 Csipcsirip: but when the scores are 0 simmetricity is a good approximation
 Kellthazar: Dont you consider enemy moves Csripcsirip?
 Csipcsirip: not yet I just use the  MCTS to make some collaboration between my pacs
 Csipcsirip: but I guess I'll add the enemy with limited search depth / score, to avaoid chasing pellets, that will be eaten in few turns
 Kellthazar: Really nice article...
 eulerscheZahl: damn you random Csipcsirip
 eulerscheZahl: now i have to debug offline&#160;:/
 Csipcsirip: you can expect me submitting in every 10minits from now :p 
 Csipcsirip: but that win was no coincidence :D 
 JohnCM: haha that's good
 JohnCM: i'm hoping to implement some advanced kill techniques like euler. hopefully that will give me a boost
 eulerscheZahl: i clearly have a bug there. i was aware of it before but that match is a good way to reproduce it
 eulerscheZahl: as advanced as in frame 85? :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464158575">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464158575</a>
 Csipcsirip: I think I submitted that version again  btw
 eulerscheZahl: that's the bug i'll address now
 JohnCM: ah yup that kind
 JohnCM: kill in a dead end
 eulerscheZahl: and i miss it
 eulerscheZahl: i exactly know why
 JohnCM: that's good:)
 eulerscheZahl: but needs a bit of cleanup
 JohnCM: woohoo my recent submit is doing well
 eulerscheZahl: you are close to 1st python already
 Csipcsirip: I'm not sure btw to waste 5-10 rounds to kill an opponent pacman. especially at the end of the game
 JohnCM: i optimized a bit of my heuristics to prioritize exploration more than exploit
 Csipcsirip: *if its worth it
 JohnCM: oh it's worth it at the start
 JohnCM: either way, a sure kill helps remove one moving piece
 JohnCM: quite worth it
 JohnCM: romka does it quite often also
 JohnCM: so funny how changing one of my heuristic by 0.1 can jump me 50 places
 JohnCM: i feel like i'm the one tuning a "neural network" of heuristics
 JohnCM: maybe it could be automated
 vbplaya: I got on day one and did some coding but ran into a problem where on bigger maps the  visible pellet count was not correct so it was failing because it was trying to take 1 too many "input()".  
 Csipcsirip: I'm almost 100% sure that the problem is not in the inputs given by cg :P
 JohnCM: great.. happy with this recent submit. hopefully it'll be better after i implement the trap mechanism
 JohnCM:&#160;:)
 vbplaya: Ok, I understand that but I tried the starter code and it had the same issue.  I had to change the line: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de571b75-fd80-4bef-838f-c90f776a4ed6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de571b75-fd80-4bef-838f-c90f776a4ed6</a>
 JohnCM: could it be the problem is not in the visible pellet input
 JohnCM: but in the lines before?
 JohnCM: like you read a line two times?
 JohnCM: why not try printing out the inputs given and see if they make sense, maybe this would help you find out where the bug is
 NapTown: never heard anybody else with that issue, and it would be a big issue
 vbplaya: I did do the printing out .... I can't imagine nobody else had it but maybe it was something else (it was pretty late).  I was thinking that they might have fixed it.  Who knows ... but it was odd 
 JohnCM: maybe you could give us the chunk of code where you did the input parsing (only the input)
 vbplaya: If nobody else saw it ... then it must have been an issue with my code (or a python thing)
 JohnCM: i could help you debug
 NapTown: i don't think he still has the issue
 JohnCM: oh that's good news then
 JohnCM: don't need to worry about it
 vbplaya: Ok ... I'll try it with the original again and see if it pops up again.  Thanks
 vbplaya: BTW, JohnCM ... thanks for offering to help me debug ... very cool of you.
 Csipcsirip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464167359">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464167359</a>
 Csipcsirip: you shall not pass
 JohnCM: vbplaya, no worries. i help when i can
 JohnCM: cause i use python also, so it is easier for me
 JohnCM: @csipcsirip, actually staying still in a collision seems pretty impressive
 JohnCM: it is like.. i don't care if you want to go through, i'm not moving
 JohnCM: wow csipcsirip you sure rose very high up
 Csipcsirip: thx. my search started to be working...wasted 2 days for not working algos
 JohnCM: i don't really do monte carlo tree search, but i have an essence of that in my heuristics
 JohnCM: works much faster for python
 JohnCM: i think this competition is not settled yet
 JohnCM: everytime someone becomes 1st, there's a counter-strategy to their strategy
 JohnCM: it's very hard to be all-rounded
 Zandy156: It's almost like its a game of paper rock scissors.
 JohnCM: or rather a game of hide and seek
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like vbplaya is not flushing the error stream
 vbplaya: eulerscheZahl ... I'll bite ... what do you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: looking at your code snippet: you assume that you don't get the last line of input?
 eulerscheZahl: and that would be wrong. you just don't see it in the error output
 eulerscheZahl: print(..., flush=True)
 vbplaya: Yes, in order to not get a timeout waiting for the last input (which never came) 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/python3-buffering-causes-confusion/181353/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/python3-buffering-causes-confusion/181353/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: read this
 vbplaya: reading it now
 vbplaya: very interesting ... I am a little confused on how to implement a "fix" on my end though.  
 eulerscheZahl: you flush the output yourself
 vbplaya: are you saying when I send the move command?
 eulerscheZahl: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 eulerscheZahl: just add the flush=True part to your printing
 vbplaya: ok ... so put in a flush in the loop which reads in the points.
 eulerscheZahl: that prints the points
 vbplaya: Will do ... thanks euler ... always learning things ... 
 Bernard_Lowe: is anyone else frustrated that silver introduces showing dead pac-men now?
 Bernard_Lowe: Time to fix up all my code to not avoid dead pac-man.
 BenWo: not really
 BenWo: I mean you already had to account for dead ones, now you just have another way to identify them
 Bernard_Lowe: I didn't account for dead pacmen before. I was thinking about writing code for that.
 Bernard_Lowe: I wonder what changes will show up in gold league. They said bronze would have all rules, but they kinda lied.
 thibpat: hello :wave: I'm going live to continue my Spring Challenge bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 BenWo: but you always had to not send commands to dead pacs
 Bernard_Lowe: correct.
 Bernard_Lowe: But, now dead pacs stay in my lists, so now I need to factor them out.
 Bernard_Lowe: With no changes in my code, bronze --&gt; I lost some optimization in my code.
 CanisLupus: thats not truw, you can ignore dead status and command them. Game is protected: "- Pac 2 is dead! It cannot be commanded anymore!"
 BenWo: hm, ok, I'm sure we structured things differently
 Bernard_Lowe: for friendly pac-man yes.
 Quidome: or drop the pac when getting the input, minimal change
 Bernard_Lowe: for enemy dead pac-man, no.
 MSmits: if(type == "DEAD") continue
 MSmits: problem solved
 Quidome: \o/
 Bernard_Lowe: yeah, but I have many sections of enemy pac-men checks. so I gotta findem all.
 Bernard_Lowe: Are there any changes in gold?
 Quidome: no
 Bernard_Lowe: Start with 20 pac-man? lol
 BenWo: lol ouch
 MSmits: if you do it at input, it will be the same for your code
 MSmits: your 20 checks will be the same
 Bernard_Lowe: good point MSmits, I'll do that, thanks.
 MSmits: the enemy pacs wont show up in any lists
 MSmits: kk 
 perseverent: hello
 MSmits: btw, i also found it slightly annoying, but it was mostly my own fault. I had already written 1500 lines and I didn't remember what I did about dead pacs
 perseverent: still in silver after implementing pathfinding
 perseverent: hardest silver ever
 perseverent: what should I do to get to gold?
 eulerscheZahl: kill all the opponents
 MSmits: perseverent, my theory is that it's hard because silver was best 300 out of 4000 when it opened
 eulerscheZahl: and harvest on your way there
 MSmits: when often it is best 300 out of 1500
 perseverent: I see
 MSmits: also more people may have spent more time coding because of stay at home
 Zandy156: It definitely changes things
 perseverent: I mostly ignore enemy pac if I can
 eulerscheZahl: many new players who are probably weaker than veterans on average make it a little less drastic as it sounds. but still harder going by numbers
 MSmits: there was also little time between ooc and this
 mlomb: I still don't attack other pacs
 MSmits: that means people may have gone in more prepared and again, spent more time coding
 mlomb: I think it's time
 perseverent: what are you doing in gold if in silver is this level
 perseverent:&#160;?
 MSmits: my code hasnt changed much since silver
 MSmits: still 22 :P
 perseverent: wow
 perseverent: great for you
 MSmits: yeah, but i want to get legend, so to be safe, i do need some real improvement today
 MSmits: though likely i will be close enough to gold boss that i will get in randomly over the weekend
 perseverent: real improvement? levitation?
 BenWo: I'll be pumped if I somehow make Legend
 BenWo: feel like I can do gold if I get some motivation here
 MSmits: i still need to hardcode superpellets properly
 MSmits: get some dead end kills when i detect them
 MSmits: avoid some dead end losses
 MSmits: that should be doable today i hope
 perseverent: do you make some kind of simulations?
 MSmits: yes, monte carlo
 MSmits: do random moves, pick the best combination
 perseverent: is this level necessary to beat the silver boss
 perseverent: does not seem so hard
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: gonna get to work. Good luck perseverent
 perseverent: good luck tou you too MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure that the silver boss itself doesn't do anything fancy
 eulerscheZahl: CG likes simple bosses with short code and low CPU footprint
 Rickardo: hi
 NapTown: hello
 Rickardo: does anyone know shadow of knoght
 NapTown: first one?
 Rickardo: yea
 NapTown: you need help with it?
 NapTown: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1-puzzle-discussion/264">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1-puzzle-discussion/264</a>
 Rickardo: yea
 AntiSquid: someone does know i am sure
 Rickardo: yea maybe
 AntiSquid: ah Rickardo bubble sort 
 AntiSquid: + get an avatar
 Rickardo: nah not important
 eulerscheZahl: #1 :othat's a resubmit of my #16 bot
 eulerscheZahl: and it's gone
 kovi: so random
 ScryptAn: Could someone give advice about "Ghost in the Cell" in bronze?
 eulerscheZahl: ScryptAn did you check the forum? lots of players describing their strategies
 AntiSquid: random, but some are at specific ranks more often
 Rickardo: pls y can't someone learn html
 351062: The toad going strong
 AntiSquid: what do you mean?
 AntiSquid: i know html @_@
 eulerscheZahl: still the recalc will be fun again
 NapTown: someone can
 Rickardo: like when i want to solve a game html isn't part of the options
 AntiSquid: troll&#160;?
 Rickardo: wat u mean
 AntiSquid: use javascript / typescript @_@
 Rickardo: type script
 AntiSquid: do you want to learn html&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i can give you some useful links
 Rickardo: but i know html well but y can't i use it
 eulerscheZahl: for bot programming?
 eulerscheZahl: you must be trolling
 AntiSquid: then you would know what html is Rickardo
 AntiSquid: you clearly don't
 Rickardo: i know wa5t html is
 eulerscheZahl: hyper text MARKUP language
 Ramzel: In the night my rank raised by 100 xd
 eulerscheZahl: not a programming language
 AntiSquid: also the html joke is shit and old
 Rickardo: oh no wonder
 TinfoilSaint: to be fair you can solve fizz buzz with CSS
 eulerscheZahl: html+css is turing complete
 Rickardo: well can u show me some useful java and javascript libks
 eulerscheZahl: because java and javascript are almost the same?
 AntiSquid: i can show you the way out 
 TinfoilSaint: If you haven't checked out freecodecamp.org Rickardo then you should
 eulerscheZahl: calm down AntiSquid
 TinfoilSaint: some of the best free beginners coding tuition out there
 Rickardo: yea but do u hav any links
 TinfoilSaint: ...
 AntiSquid: yes
 eulerscheZahl: google.com
 TinfoilSaint: I just gave you the link
 Rickardo: funny
 TinfoilSaint: :joy:
 AntiSquid: was about to suggest freecodecamp too
 sgalasso: Hi everyone, does anyone have an idea of how we can get the current  turn of the game&#160;?
 Washier: haha.
 AntiSquid: sololearn if you need something easier Rickardo
 Rickardo: ok i will try out those web and apps
 AntiSquid: keep track of turns sgalasso
 AntiSquid: ok bye
 Rickardo: thnks everyone
 AntiSquid: np
 AntiSquid: you just count the turns sgalasso
 AntiSquid: first turn of inputs = turn 1, increment number afterwards
 AntiSquid: no point pming me sgalasso 
 AntiSquid: also that part is what everyone struggles with so idk 
 Rickardo: gg
 Rickardo: g
 AntiSquid: are you a prince btw?
 Adnmaster: do i need to know pathfinding or something like that to get into silver?
 Doju: you don't have to but it'll surely help
 Adnmaster: so just with coding knowledge without any other tricks i can get into silver?
 Doju: uhh
 Adnmaster:&#160;?
 Doju: if you give your pacs sensible commands and have considered other things as well as pellets
 Doju: then sure
 Adnmaster: ok
 Doju: but it'll be hard to make them collaborate for example
 Doju: if you don't have pathfinding
 BenWo: heya Doju
 Doju: heya BenWo!
 BenWo: it's our day for Gold league, right?
 AntiSquid: Adnmaster probably more effort to write the if statements for that than doing pathfinding
 Adnmaster: ok
 Doju: BenWo yup
 Doju: AntiSquid i agree
 Peudoki: how many people do you think will make it to legend?
 Denebil: I haven't used pathfinding before silver
 BenWo: Legend, no idea... 200?
 AntiSquid: 15 max
 AntiSquid: imo
 AntiSquid: and from monday it's a multiplayer anyway so i don't see why they would go for bigger legend
 Doju: Do any of you have a recursive "conflict solver" thing?
 Doju: where pacs want the same thing or are gonna crash
 Doju: I think that'd be an easy and best way to go about it but it'll sure be slow
 AntiSquid: not recursive
 AntiSquid: but yes
 Doju: Okay
 Doju: How can it be not recursive?
 NapTown: i just check if i'm in stuck in the same spot and whether a friendly is the reason or not
 Doju: you don't do the same check for the next points?
 Doju: NapTown i do that too but it wastes so many moves
 NapTown: doesn't have to
 NapTown: depends how you handle it
 Doju: at least 1
 Doju: or actually 3 in total
 AntiSquid: people dropped so much, some 150 ranks
 qjzx1314: so amazing
 AntiSquid: hi qjzx1314 here's a fun challenge for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 WINWINWIN: Top 3 is varying a lot
 BenWo: doing a big rewrite, this is going to have so many bugs by the time I can run it again&#160;:(
 NapTown: that was me 2 days ago
 Doju: Oh huh there are a lot of people here from a local company :D
 Doju: that's cool
 WINWINWIN: Contest is getting really tough, I`ll be surprised if I can end up in top 1000
 qjzx1314: yeah
 qjzx1314: Bless to you
 thethiny: My Pathfinding went  from 50ms to 3ms
 thethiny: WOOHOO
 NapTown: how
 thethiny: I've never optimized code as much in my life
 eulerscheZahl: try ultimate tic tac toe if you like speed optimizations
 thethiny: @NapTown I replaced my "visited" nodes with only 1 node that contains the parents as a reference
 thethiny: saves me some recursions
 thethiny: by some, that's 47ms
 Doju: wow
 thethiny: NonOpt Total Time 0.04488039016723633Opt Total Time 0.0029914379119873047
 qjzx1314: so cool
 dbf: :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: recursions are slow
 thethiny: yes
 NapTown: nice
 thethiny: let's hope that I can do something now with all of this
 Rprades: I am little bit lost on how to find a dead end for an enemy so I can kill him for sure
 Rprades: any ideas are welcome!
 Rprades: should I just simulate his moves to see if he can escape?
 Doju: Rprades i've been thinking about that too
 NapTown: you can find the locations that are dead ends
 WINWINWIN: doju have you implemented a pathfinder?
 Doju: WINWINWIN yes i have BFS
 jrke: i am trying BFS
 Csipcsirip: you start a bfs from enemy loc you go until a cell that  more than 2 neighbours. if you count only 1 of them he is in a dead end
 Doju: hmm
 Doju: sure
 Doju: that makes sens
 Doju: sense
 NapTown: i have my graph nodes marked as deadend, but that's only for scoring pellets, haven't trapped anybody yet
 Adnmaster: is it possible to see the ability cooldown of the opponent?
 [CG]Thibaud: print it and you'll see
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: is there any place where i can learn pathfinding?
 Doju: A lot of people linked this page <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a>
 dbf: 'pathfinding algorithm' -&gt; google
 Doju: but personally i just read this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search</a>

 kovi: no leaderboard?
 kovi: or just sloooow
 ashelkov: empty)
 kovi: huh, chat is also slow
 ashelkov: oh no . seen it/ you 1st
 ashelkov: congratz!
 AntiSquid: he and 5 other people or so :D
 AntiSquid: maybe there should be a counter somewhere showing how long everyone held 1st place for&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: pb4 made a diagram like that for one of the contest for top10 places
 Ramzel: I m almost always winning with silver boss in IDE, but i cant reach him while submiting ;c
 alinde2: 50 in silver, so close! :fearful:
 BenWo: hey nice
 BenWo: so you're one of those people who pushed me back over 200&#160;:-/
 alinde2: I'll put you back under 200 by going to gold :stuck_out_tongue:
 Ramzel: Domiko congrats gold
 BenWo: haha great thanks&#160;;)
 jrke: domiko going in gold
 LelouchVC2: I don't even wanna check if the bug in the contest is fixed
 eulerscheZahl: which bug?
 LelouchVC2: Giving me a dead pac as viable 
 struct: impossible
 wlesavo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: dead pacmen have the type DEAD
 eulerscheZahl: and that's a feature, not a bug
 wlesavo: and its not fixed, rather introduced
 struct: I found the origin of the bug
 struct: The DEAD pac is for silver+ only
 LelouchVC2: mentally retarded either way
 LelouchVC2: It wasn't doing it one day
 LelouchVC2: The next day it was, I outputted the given pacs after I looked through everything else
 LelouchVC2: And it definitely gave me a dead pac
 struct: it gives you dead pacs
 eulerscheZahl: on purpose
 eulerscheZahl: the statement got an update too
 eulerscheZahl: are you in silver? there's a green section
 eulerscheZahl: highlighting the changes
 struct: he is in bronze
 struct: Thats why no dead on typeId
 LelouchVC2: I didn't touch it since last week 
 LelouchVC2: silver hadn't even open yet
 struct: if your pac dies
 struct: you dont get him in your input
 struct: at least I think
 struct: at least you didnt before
 LelouchVC2: That's what it should have been
 LelouchVC2: But there it was
 eulerscheZahl: if type == "DEAD": continue
 DJDiscoWorm_ce7a: hi
 Ramzel: 24'th in silver 50'th battel
 struct: no euler
 LelouchVC2: Contest pissed me off&#160;:/
 struct: it wont show dead on bronze
 DJDiscoWorm_ce7a: is there a way to read the answer for the quiz\
 Ramzel: Is still a chance to go up yo gold?
 struct: LelouchVC2 I just checked
 NapTown: he doesn't have type=DEAD yet
 struct: if your pac dies
 LelouchVC2: Pacs were kicking ass and then couldn't win cause of it
 struct: it doesnt show on input anymore
 wlesavo: LelouchVC2 thats really sounds like your own bug btw
 LelouchVC2: Not gonna keep doing it while behind
 eulerscheZahl: then i will just ignore the chat for the next couple of minutes. you seem to understand the issue better than i do
 LelouchVC2: I know wlesavo
 struct: I meant no disrespect euler&#160;:/
 LelouchVC2: But it really isn't though
 DJDiscoWorm_ce7a: is there anyone can help me solve the problem
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't read it that way struct
 NapTown: LelouchVC2 are you checking the mine flag?
 eulerscheZahl: just bored of the discussion, your job now&#160;;)
 struct: LelouchVC2 look
 struct: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f0a9c32-8f37-4053-8ba1-42473e6d56f6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f0a9c32-8f37-4053-8ba1-42473e6d56f6</a>
 LelouchVC2: yep
 struct: after pac dies it doesnt show anymore
 wlesavo: LelouchVC2 if that would be the case all the bots would crash instantly, and they dont 
 LelouchVC2: I outputted the pacs that i was given right after the pac died
 LelouchVC2: it was clearly there
 struct: maybe you checked wrong frame
 wlesavo: error stream may look to be delayed sometimes
 wlesavo: you need to check coors to be sure you looking at the same frame
 LelouchVC2: Outputted to standard stream
 LelouchVC2: I never use the error stream
 LelouchVC2: Set it to output the pacs given right after a pac died, and it gave me all my pacs
 LelouchVC2: Maybe fixed now, just saying it pissed me off
 WINWINWIN: #432 Silver now, its too tough&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: giving up too soon
 Ramzel: #9 in Silver after so many tries
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:( I have no idea how to write a BFS so I dont think I can get any further
 Ramzel: What language?
 WINWINWIN: python3
 Ramzel: Cant help u
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) which lang?
 Ramzel: As i heard graph tasks in pyhon are horrible
 struct: WINWINWIN there are lots of resources for BFS online
 dbf: WINWINWIN, what issue do you have with BFS?
 Ramzel: In c++ it is easily
 WINWINWIN: Not learnt it and have no idea how to modify it for this
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-distance-two-cells-matrix-grid/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-distance-two-cells-matrix-grid/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i bet you can understand the code and apply the logic in python
 WINWINWIN: Even if I can write one, what is thedifference between my BFS and the in-built pathfinding?
 eulerscheZahl: even if i'm not completely happy about the coding style in the article i linked. lots of code duplication
 dbf: WINWINWIN, for example, you can calculate actual distance to pellets
 struct: How do you calculate distance WINWINWIN?
 eulerscheZahl: the in-built path finding gives you less flexibility
 eulerscheZahl: and finding the closest pellet of course. good point dbf
 WINWINWIN: I copied the distance function in the referee
 Csipcsirip: yeah codes in articles like that have usually bad quality
 offroff: how deep are you guys making those searches?
 eulerscheZahl: only 4 turns&#160;:/
 Csipcsirip: (2 or 1) * 15
 eulerscheZahl: but my opponent tracker improved
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464232411">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464232411</a>that kill...&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: built in pathfinding does more damage than good
 offroff: nice one
 struct: current rank 1 plays coc
 struct: coc is good 
 dbf: @eulerscheZahl check your tracker for timeouts: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464248625">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464248625</a>&#160;:)
 offroff: I guess 4 turns is enough for some nice tricks
 BenWo: that was impressive euler
 Rickardo: i just entered level 4
 Rickardo: and i am a rookie
 eulerscheZahl: 16ms to track, 90ms to print an answer
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see the problem dbj :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: and i can't type your name. and not tab-complete without pinging dbdr
 dbf: haha
 dbdr: thanks :D
 Ramzel: Clyde has not provided 1 lines in time
 Ramzel: when bot gets bugged
 eulerscheZahl: i should add a header before legend opens."This bot has a kill switch. Do you feel confident to remove it or do you want to choose another boss?"
 NapTown: poor clyde
 eulerscheZahl: i fear that the boss will be well studied, giving a disadvantage to the player
 Ramzel: Lets resubmit almost same code
 struct: you can break your bot and then submit again 
 struct: But you can also not beat boss :p
 AntiSquid: tiny change can mean 100 rank difference so
 Doju: How is it possible that my last bot which wasted a turn every time there was no pellet directly next to the target ranks 200 places higher than the fixed one&#160;:/
 LelouchVC2: Because Physics allows for E=MC^2
 LelouchVC2: Which invalidates your logic
 Ramzel: The funny fact is that i almost always beat boss in ide but i m losing to often with pp close under boss
 BenWo: no idea Doju
 zarif98sjs: This randomness sucks
 BenWo: maybe need some values tweaked
 NapTown: Doju when you find out why you can fix it again:grinning:
 BenWo: or just needs time
 WINWINWIN: The game stops automatically after 200 turns.
 WINWINWIN: is this true?
 NapTown: yes
 BenWo: yes
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464277907">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464277907</a>
 BenWo: but it's turns, not frames
 RoboStac: viewer shows more than 200 frames due to speed though
 wlesavo: euler how is it usually done, dont boss have to be resubmitted right? 
 WINWINWIN: 299 turns
 Doju: NapTown yeah prolly that
 wlesavo: otherwise cut off wont be so perfect for sure
 BenWo: 200 turns, plus 99 SPEED frames
 eulerscheZahl: in the past they did submit the boss again. but now they just take the player and copy the rank
 wlesavo: i see
 eulerscheZahl: they even had a test account
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/fc95dc0400be658ec8266b29286952285877531">https://www.codingame.com/profile/fc95dc0400be658ec8266b29286952285877531</a>
 wlesavo: that make sense in this one for sure
 Earthborne: Does activating speed boost take up one round?
 BenWo: yep
 eulerscheZahl: so we were all chatting and watching default AI climb on the leaderboard which submit slowly finishing
 Earthborne: Well that explain some of the mess in my rules
 Doju: Maybe i'm timing out
 WINWINWIN: Another submit, this time I will start using SPEED&#160;:)
 Doju: gotta watch some losing games
 HKTran: when I try to counter some trapped-SWITCH strategy, I lose to some opponent who not even try any strategy
 HKTran: :joy:
 NapTown: sounds about right
 zarif98sjs: how actually is the standings calculated&#160;?
 AntiSquid: someone manually inserts a rank, if you don't believe me just watch top 10 over a long period of time zarif98sjs
 Doju: :D
 eulerscheZahl: with the Trueskill algorithm
 Scarfield: I thought it said in the faq, but this is actually all the faq says: 
 Scarfield: How are scores calculated?Your score is awarded when you submit your solution: your code is tested with sets of test cases which cover the game’s specifications. The more test cases your code can pass, the higher your score will be.
 Ramzel: Removed defence mechanism and winning almost everything
 AntiSquid: for more detailed read on the ELO algorithm zarif98sjs&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.random.org/">https://www.random.org/</a>
 AntiSquid: (well it feel that way at least)
 eulerscheZahl: Trueskill and ELO are not the same
 BenWo: lol
 NapTown: Gold finally :grinning:
 NickStahl: Good job NapTown
 BenWo: nice
 NapTown: thanks now i can go to bed
 Ramzel: Lets go GOLD(submit)
 zarif98sjs: NapTown any suggestion for gold&#160;? been stuck around 250-300 for the past 2 days 
 eulerscheZahl: share a replay of your bot
 zarif98sjs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464297339">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464297339</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's some bad coordination at the bottom right corner
 NapTown: zarif98sjs the biggest thing was enemy tracking, mine is very simple but it shot me up pretty quick
 Ramzel: Enemy tracking? Isnt is slow much?
 NapTown: maybe if it was complicated, but mine isn't
 Ramzel: Would u say sth more?
 Ramzel: :D
 NapTown: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 zarif98sjs: The enemy tracking seems to be tricky since I can't always see them&#160;:| 
 NapTown: if you could see them you wouldn't need tracking&#160;:)
 zarif98sjs: :cry:
 eulerscheZahl: but understanding your opponent helps you to know which pellets are gone
 Doju: yuck, i'm gonna be calling two recursive functions on each move
 Doju: that might not be a smart idea
 BenWo: wow, what for?
 Doju: checking for conflicting targets and paths
 Doju: im gonna have some functions which grab new targets until none of them are the same
 Doju: i guess i could just do this with while loops, but i like the idea of recursion
 Doju: and it cant be that much slower, can it?
 BenWo: probably not
 Ramzel: eulerscheZahl are u using some of euler tricks?
 Doju: actually i think this might lead to an infinite loop :d
 BenWo: I'd be surprised if it didn't at least in a few cases
 Doju: having a pen and paper close by is reeeally handy while coding stuff like this
 SparshMc07: ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 SparshMc07: kpihlk/k
 Doju: wait, that's supposed to be called "pen and paper", not "a pen and paper", right?
 Doju: trying to improve my english as well as my coding :p
 NapTown: i don't see a difference really
 Doju: Oh you're from the US
 Doju: i've been wondering why there are very few american people here
 NapTown: couldn't say
 Doju: hm
 Earthborne: Maybe most of them are asleep when we are awake?
 Doju: maybe i'm usually just sleeping while you're here
 Doju: yeah
 [Csongor]: finally silver
 NapTown: yes probably
 NapTown: 6:30 am where i am
 llllllllll: grat!&#160;:)
 Doju: can you teach me your ways NapTown
 Doju: is the secret napping?
 NapTown: napping is the secret to everything
 alinde2: Consistency winning against the bot in ide, but can't reach it in the leaderboard :upside_down:
 zarif98sjs: what's your position now
 Doju: Is there a way to do something like this in python?
 Doju: for pac in pacs if pac.alive:
 Doju: it's messy to write this every time
 Doju: for pac in pacs:
 Uljahn: if not pac.alive: continue
 ntroPi: you could just fill an array of living pacs once per loop.
 Doju: hm
 Doju: yeah i thought of splitting my existing dict of pacs["my"] and pacs["en"] into pacs["my"]["alive"]
 Doju: for example
 Doju: not sure if it's worth it to start modifying everything though
 NickStahl: Doju, why do you keep a ref to your own dead pacs? Why not remove them at start of the loop?
 Doju: Hmm, that would make sense as well
 Earthborne: You can nest in a list comprehension:for pac in [pac for pac in pacs if pac.isalive]
 Earthborne: Doju
 ntroPi: Is it known, whether the pac game will stay active after the contest? Will there be a pause period before the eternal season starts?
 Earthborne: Still messy though&#160;:)
 NapTown: fond memories of pacs lost
 Doju: Earthborne ooh yes. Is that fast?
 Doju: i like list comprehensions
 Doju: NickStahl i think my logic for not deleting them was something like keeping it consistent
 Doju: if enemy pacs have ["dead"] and ["alive"] then my pacs should too
 Earthborne: Dunno, I wouldn't think so since you're iterating and creating a new list before iterating over that one
 Doju: actually i did do have a delete dead pacs method but it doesn't do anything anymore since it relied on vision
 ArmoredAssassin: hey guys, am I correct that in step when: Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move, I basically dont get any input and game just moves pacmans if they got cmds to move more than 1 step?
 Earthborne: Fastest would probably be `if not pac.isalive: continue`
 NickStahl: Doju, mybe you just pointed out a bug in my code :D
 Doju: Hahah NickStahl
 NickStahl: I think I'm still commanding my dead pacs around D:
 Doju: somebody told me that i was commanding my dead pacs
 Doju: and then i found that bug
 Earthborne: But with a length of max 5, I don't think that's where you'll timeout Doju
 Earthborne: Oh, I did that for a while too!
 NickStahl: lol Doju, same bug here :D
 Doju: Earthborne fair point
 Doju: i'm gonna be doing a lot of recursion through that list so i dont want it to be super slow though
 Doju: but i guess anything is fast enough with a length of 5
 Doju: NickStahl you're welcome :P
 Doju: Earthborne i think your solution is good if you change the brackets to braces instead to make a generator
 eulerscheZahl: codingame IDE just randomly decided to run a syntax check on my code. now everything is red for no apparent reason
 RoboStac: you'll have to delete it all and start again
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Doju: yeah your code is just one big syntax error
 Doju: sorry euler
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/shada4">https://prnt.sc/shada4</a>so much red
 NapTown: mine has been doing that too
 llllllllll: CODE SHARING, ALERT, ALERT
 eulerscheZahl: luckily i don't use that web IDE
 dbf: code is shared -&gt; ban
 llllllllll: ^^
 dbf: :expressionless:
 eulerscheZahl: that's only the input parsing from the default code
 alinde2: That's the default input code @dbf...
 eulerscheZahl: and an encoding error at using System; because of my bundler
 dbf: no, you shared your secret dx/dy arrays
 RoboStac: default c# code has an enemy tracker? :O
 weegee: hello
 RoboStac: I knew I should have used c#
 eulerscheZahl: i beginner's mistake not to take C#
 Csipcsirip: isnt't it because of that special character before the second using&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: actually using System; is my first
 eulerscheZahl: but the bundler (python) uses a set for unique usings
 eulerscheZahl: so order changes everytime i compile my bot
 Csipcsirip: one big file ftw
 eulerscheZahl: 7 big files
 BenWo: ok, got a good part of new pathing done
 BenWo: now I have to recode my pacs to understand the output of it :confounded:
 llllllllll: MOVE 0 21886 2046702944ok, something is wrong here
 BenWo: lol wow
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Doju: nah the target is just a bit further away
 llllllllll: my C++ porting didn't go so well
 SemChumboPT: those pacs are going to the moon
 eulerscheZahl: your pacman will reach that cell by the end of the contest
 NapTown: round to 2 digits :D
 llllllllll: LOL
 MahirSez: While being in speed mode, Is it possible for a pac to go 2 steps where the 2nd step would return to its original position?
 MarekM: yes
 MarekM: oh so, no probalby
 BenWo: no
 BenWo: code is coming up on 900 lines&#160;:/
 BenWo: though there is a fair bit of redundancy at the moment
 Rprades: was legend going to be open in 16th always? I thought it was on 15th
 Rprades: have they changed the date or did I get confused with the dates?
 eulerscheZahl: 6pm CEST
 eulerscheZahl: that is in a little less than 5h from now
 Rprades: check now, it says 16th May
 eulerscheZahl: as 15th for me
 Clagus: do I need to beat the boss 100% to advance to gold?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know why, but CG has some problems with dates, showing the wrong day to some users
 Rprades: wow, I refreshed the paged and changed back to 15th
 Adnmaster: you need to beat more people than the boss Clagus
 Doju: No, you need to beat him in the rankings Clagus
 eulerscheZahl: you have to rank above the boss on the leaderboard
 ntroPi: No you just need to be above him in ranking which is possible even if you beat him &lt;50% of the time
 Rprades: thanks&#160;:)
 Clagus: ok, thanks
 BenWo: actually, where are they announcing the date?
 BenWo: I haven't even looked for it
 eulerscheZahl: click the league at the top
 eulerscheZahl: in the IDE
 Rprades: it is my first serious contest and i am a little bit excited
 Rprades: hopefully I can make it Legend!
 BenWo: oh ok
 BenWo: thought there was a blog or something
 RoboStac: refresh, it'll go back to 15th
 eulerscheZahl: about top10-15 players will be in legend when it opens
 Clagus: for me it's:"League opening: 5/17/20" :D
 eulerscheZahl: sorry to tell you, but you have to improve your bot first
 Rprades: rank 32 atm, hope I can beat the boss later on
 BenWo: says 5/15 for me
 eulerscheZahl: you'll probably have to improve a bit for legend
 Rprades: will try, but Im running out of ideas, python is very slow!
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand: that's by far the largest contest for a long time. maybe they show mercy
 Clagus: ok, so I need to be better in ranking than boss, but how can I tell which ranking boss have?
 eulerscheZahl: it's even the biggest contest ever
 eulerscheZahl: the boss will appear on the leaderboard
 Rprades: let's see then!
 eulerscheZahl: no way to miss it when it's tehre
 Clagus: but for silver it should be there already right?
 kovi: too bad, it is so random
 BenWo: boss is generally in rank 1
 eulerscheZahl: only visible if you are in silver
 BenWo: click on "last battles" at left of IDE&lt;&lt;==========
 eulerscheZahl: the randomness is frustrating
 eulerscheZahl: there are some deaths that you just can't avoid
 BenWo: well gotta run, ttyl
 Rprades: yes, speed is much more important than switch
 Rprades: most of the games are decided in the frst 15 turns
 Adnmaster: well by me, i win by killing my opponent using switch
 Adnmaster: so theyre equal
 Rprades: unless he is on a dead end or you have speed activated (thus no switch available), your opponent will always be able to escape
 Rprades: and if you have speed and he does not, he will be ablw to switch before than you
 Adnmaster: i dont use speed :sweat_smile:
 Rprades: I think you should&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: +1 for speed
 Adnmaster: i made a system that when the enemy isnt near it uses speed if it is near it uses switch
 Adnmaster: but for some reason the speed part doesnt work
 Adnmaster: it calculates the distance wrong
 eulerscheZahl: what means "doesn't work"?
 Adnmaster: it calculates wrong
 Adnmaster: calculation works for switch, but by me it doesnt work for speed
 Adnmaster: even if the enemy is near it uses speed
 MahirSez: How many people will advance to legend any idea?
 MahirSez: *on 1st go
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud discouraging us from reaching legend?
 eulerscheZahl: about 10-15 players legend opens
 eulerscheZahl: at least that's the usual size. not sure if it will be a little more given the higher player count
 Csipcsirip: hm I learned it again that it's not a good idea to make functions like this
 Csipcsirip: PacmanType counter(PacmanType pt) {
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl discouraging?
 Ramzel: Where is legend league?
 llllllllll: opens at 6
 weegee: ```jsconsole.log("hi)```
 Doju: Legend opens today?
 Doju: oh dear
 Doju: i gotta get at least to the bottom of gold before that
 eulerscheZahl: read your emails dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: i know you stopped doing that
 eulerscheZahl: The Legend league will open in a few hours, but for many players (including me), it's really difficult to reach it. 
 eulerscheZahl:  Improve your own scoreIt's easier to try to beat your own record than to aim for the moon. 
 Chkoupinator: speed doesn't limit the ability to turn right? 
 Adnmaster: no
 dbdr: you just cannot turn 180
 eulerscheZahl: which is sad
 Chkoupinator: yeah makes sense since you can only input one move statement per turn
 weegee: how long have you guys been playing?
 eulerscheZahl: 8 days
 muy31: 8 days
 Doju: ^
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, did he tell how big the Legend league will be?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 dbdr: always a rurprise
 eulerscheZahl: Hello, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c00f879-4943-4a8c-bb21-12cb6b2d4354">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c00f879-4943-4a8c-bb21-12cb6b2d4354</a>
 Illedan: Hope at 22.63 points :D 
 eulerscheZahl: no way
 dbdr: OOC was a bad surprise for me, was sure to get in at opening, missed it by an epsilon
 Illedan: Nah, I hope not
 eulerscheZahl: more like 25-26
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Then I have to get out of hiding&#160;:(
 dbdr: 30
 dbdr: put a boss above everyone :D
 eulerscheZahl: for OOC i was expecting a larger legend because we already had 3 weeks to code ecent bots
 Illedan: Take kov i and fix his code? :D
 eulerscheZahl: decent*
 Doju: Why even is there a league system?
 dbdr: take a player bot, improve it, release it as boss
 dbdr: yeah Illedan
 Doju: or okay, leagues make sense as "markers" for how far you've gone
 Illedan: That would be impressive though
 eulerscheZahl: to get less noise Doju
 Illedan: W00t, only C++ in the top
 Doju: Okay, thx eulerscheZahl
 Illedan: is it getting that hard u there?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a pain to submit with 3k players and climb up all the way in the ranking
 eulerscheZahl: 50% of your submit done and you are around rank 100
 Illedan: *up
 EchoBravo: pls what are constraints
 eulerscheZahl: there are some fun observations for tracking Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: i shared a replay earlier, let's see if i can find it again
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464232411">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464232411</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the kill was not a coincidene
 eulerscheZahl: conincidence
 eulerscheZahl: requires you to know where the opponent is and what he's about to do next
 dbdr: you can't be sure what they will do
 eulerscheZahl: of course not
 eulerscheZahl: educated guessing
 Illedan: Nice
 dbdr: (TM)
 eulerscheZahl: analyzed my last battles. tried 5 times, 4 kills
 Illedan: Still only 15th with that tracking
 eulerscheZahl: was 5th before
 eulerscheZahl: unlucky submit
 Illedan: Oh, k. Spammers?
 Illedan: k
 eulerscheZahl: just me losing the first battles
 dbdr: damn, that dbdr arena timesout in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: 4 losses in first 10, was at rank 20 when submit finished
 dbdr: I wanted to play against him&#160;:(
 Csipcsirip: yeah this first10 games confuses me this time too. usually a top20 bot wins 9/10. now (4-8)/10
 Rprades: is it normal to have a score between 22 to 25 depending on the submit?
 Rprades: is it due to randomness?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Rprades: my code is deterministic and I have not changed it
 Rprades: ok&#160;:)
 kovi: robo is on the roll
 eulerscheZahl: just in time for legend opening
 eulerscheZahl: tomorrow afternoon he won't have time for us, it's codejam
 MadKnight: hey eulerscheZahl do u code in c#&#160;?
 MadKnight: this contest i mean
 eulerscheZahl: no, i use plain text
 eulerscheZahl: "if the pacman is chasing you, please SWITCH and kill, thanks"
 AntiSquid: are you doing codejam euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: that's the tshirt round
 eulerscheZahl: finals will be online this year btw
 dbdr: max_value: std::f32::BEG_INFINITY
 dbdr: what am I tryiing to say there? :D
 AntiSquid: have you been to the finals? what are they like?
 AntiSquid: not sure what the finals being online means, do you need to turn on your webcam?
 eulerscheZahl: either BIG or NEG INFINITY, not sure
 AlluringChair: is it normal that i have 600 lines of code and i'm not even close to finishing? i think i'm doing something wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know either. codejam just sent an email announcing that finals will not be in person
 eulerscheZahl: due to corona
 Doju: AlluringChair that's perfectly fine
 AntiSquid: you're begging for a win dbdr
 dbdr: infinity, I beg you...
 eulerscheZahl: i can top that AlluringChair, 1400 lines
 Doju: AlluringChair i have 750 and i have maybe 2/3 of my lines written
 AlluringChair: ok, thanks for the answers :D
 AntiSquid: managed to somehow climb a tiny bit
 Doju: Still have to do a lot of messing around with numpy and probabilities
 AntiSquid: but need to try harder  
 Doju: atm pellets either exist or they don't, there's no in between
 Doju: but i want some schrödinger pellets on my map
 AntiSquid: ooc felt easier, i just was lazy to fix my mine tracker btw
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise you would have won the contest?
 AntiSquid: yes sure
 AntiSquid: otherwise i would have gotten a better rank
 AntiSquid: who would you bet wins this contest euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: some strong players are trying
 Scarfield: 1:12000 odds on me&#160;;)
 jrke: what a lucky match i had <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464384338">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464384338</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i won't put money on you Scarfield
 Scarfield: wouldnt be smart xD
 AntiSquid: 1 penny, return rate is high
 Scarfield: wonder who would pay :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: you. you would have a monitor to sell
 eulerscheZahl: who needs curved anyways?
 Scarfield: lol thats true
 Illedan: Me!
 eulerscheZahl: wtf Illedan
 Scarfield: ille will buy, bets on :D
 Illedan: I need a 3rd monitor for random graphs looking cool
 Illedan: Now I sit on a coffetable with only laptopscreen and no external mouse :sob:
 Scarfield: why not sit on a chair?
 Illedan: haha
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-codebusters/salim.aboubacar">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-codebusters/salim.aboubacar</a> why is this guy always getting matched against me? He rekt my rank badly
 AlluringChair: make sure it's alluring
 Scarfield: xD
 cegprakash: He played 108 games and all against me?
 eulerscheZahl: lol
 cegprakash: oh wait why am I seeing codebusters
 cegprakash: my bad
 Illedan: Because you spammed..
 AntiSquid: no more python RoboStac&#160;?
 RoboStac: python bot was only meant to unlock bronze rules, it just worked rather well. Need to go faster to get to the top though
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, ceg submitted last
 Rprades: it seems I had a timeout sometimes due to many prints!
 RoboStac: though I did use it for testing some smaller tweaks while writing a better version
 Amrhossam: why do you love coding
 Doju: Rprades i feel you hahah
 Doju: debugged a working function because it was timing out
 Doju: and it was due to prints
 Scarfield: lol doju :D 2 hours well spend
 Doju: indeed
 Doju: lesson learned: prints take time
 Scarfield: i think everyone here has done that&#160;:)
 Doju: maybe
 muy31: so ive implemented a basic enemy tracking, now im removing switching so i can progress
 Doju: nice 
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud didn't promise too much. the leaderboard is indeed much faster now
 muy31: my code no longer traps opponents tho&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that's the only thing that my bot does decently well
 muy31: i beg to differ
 llllllllll: I was also thinking about creating a 'hunter' bot, which just tries to kill others
 llllllllll: but im not sure if it worth the effort
 muy31: dont do it waste of a pac
 llllllllll: but if you kill all the enemies, then you win
 muy31: cause winning is about pellets. not killing
 llllllllll: but it doesn't sounds feasible
 muy31: but most of the time pellets can escape
 llllllllll: pacs*
 llllllllll: but they cant, if you target one with multiple others
 muy31: maybe make a hunter only if there are more than 3 pacs that you have
 llllllllll: my plan was that all pacs are hunters
 muy31: not good...
 llllllllll: yeah, probably
 AlluringChair: my pacs are gonna be pacifists, they'll only run, never fight
 AlluringChair: unless cornered maybe
 MarekM:&#160;:)
 kovi: most of has pac-ifists
 eulerscheZahl: mine fight where the opponent asks for a kill
 kovi: 3 hungarians in top, where are you dbdr
 Doju: I bet someone is hiding a killer bot that will be strong in this pacifist meta
 vtenneke: haha
 eulerscheZahl: that killing isn't that simple/reliable
 dbdr: kovi I started working on my real bot
 Csipcsirip: hm time to add switch command to my repertoire
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes there's a good chance but harvest is priority
 lifetimeLearner007: anybody calculating distance from every cell to every other cell?
 llllllllll: yep
 lifetimeLearner007: without timeout
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 llllllllll: yep, in the first cycle
 lifetimeLearner007: i tried with diijkstra but timing out
 eulerscheZahl: takes me 20ms on large maps
 llllllllll: I do the same, and it doesn't
 eulerscheZahl: BFS
 Ramzel: Third in silver
 Ramzel: 82%
 llllllllll: just keep in mind that dist(a,b) = dist(b,a)
 llllllllll: and it should not time out
 Doju: i don't even do that
 Doju: and i'm doing it in 100ish ms
 Ramzel: Second in silver
 eulerscheZahl: in python
 lifetimeLearner007: how does that matter if u've to visit the same cell more than once just bcz source  is different
 Doju: yes
 Doju: in PYTHON 
 llllllllll: track visited cells
 llllllllll: if you visited it, don't update it again
 vtenneke: Would more seasoned people recommend to use C++ instead of other languages for this?
 lifetimeLearner007: visited cells set is specific to considered source right?
 Ramzel: YESSSS
 llllllllll: @vtenneke im not that seasoned, but yes.
 eulerscheZahl: just check the top of the leaderboard vtenneke
 Ramzel: NOOOO
 Ramzel: Second place in silver
 eulerscheZahl: top10: 1x C#, 9x C++
 llllllllll: im currently porting my python code to c++
 Ramzel: just below boss
 lifetimeLearner007: so close Ramzel
 vtenneke: yeah xD I saw but was wondering if people using c++ are just really smart or that the language also actually works better for stuff like this haha
 vtenneke: or a combination of course
 llllllllll: probably both
 eulerscheZahl: i think both
 Ramzel: Lets go with next submit
 lifetimeLearner007: visited cells set is specific to considered source right? so definitely same cell has to be visited more than once as source changes... else it wouldn't give shortest distance
 amriswil-it-1: hola
 llllllllll: no
 lifetimeLearner007: I'm kinda stuck at this distance calculation. (facepalm)
 llllllllll: do bfs and you will get the shortest path for every cell
 lifetimeLearner007: bfs doesn't guarantee shortest distance right....
 eulerscheZahl: do floyd warshall and you will timeout
 Doju: it does
 eulerscheZahl: A* doesn't guarantee a shortest path
 lifetimeLearner007: then, I guess there is some bug in my code...
 muy31: are you snaking?
 eulerscheZahl: do you use a stack instead of a queue?
 lifetimeLearner007: what is snaking, muy31?
 muy31: this sucks! a resubmit and now at 300s
 alinde2: A* always gives the shortest path! But your heuristic can be wrong (can't simply use euclidean distance here).
 muy31: lifetimeLearner007 snaking is like moving back and forth
 muy31: across a map
 eulerscheZahl: and with an incorrect heuristic it won't give a shortest path
 eulerscheZahl: hard to tell if your heuristic is 100* correct for all cases though
 lifetimeLearner007: I'm using queue for bfs,  euler
 alinde2: With an incorrect heuristic it isn't an A* algorithm.

 muy31: like that, except your BFS may look like that w/ incorrect heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: A* just says that you need a heuristic function to estimate the distance from a node to the target. it can't define that it has to be 100% accurate. otherwise that would mean you know the shortest path already
 eulerscheZahl: Csipcsirip calm down
 eulerscheZahl: you scare me
 Csipcsirip: my last submit crashed when all pellets were eaten during simuation..
 eulerscheZahl: yet you were on par with me already
 eulerscheZahl: damn
 cegprakash: my 1 day old code is still at #41 I'm surprised
 cegprakash: my latest code is at #120+
 muy31: what the hell do i need to get out of silver!!
 eulerscheZahl: beat the boss
 muy31: shut up
 WINWINWIN: lol muy31
 Braykin08: lol
 eulerscheZahl: :mouth_zipper:
 cegprakash: get rekt eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: muy31 go to closest pellet
 cegprakash: that's what I did to get to gold
 muy31: for real
 cegprakash: yes
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:( he means with a BFS muy31
 Doju: Just did a major modification
 Doju: let the buggening begin
 WINWINWIN: gold worthy Doju?
 Doju: for sure WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: but u have to do pellet tracking + little team cooperation muy31
 Doju: WINWINWIN i'm just hoping for bugs and not a timeout
 muy31: so cegprakash, ive been using BFS this whole time
 muy31: i implemented a score map to track pellets and enemies
 muy31: and to direct movement
 muy31: ive independently been choosing my next location
 muy31: and now you are telling me that i dont need all this
 cegprakash: yes muy31
 Clagus: ;_;
 WINWINWIN: Anyway to get to gold without a BFS?
 Rprades: who wins if both have same number of pellets? I thought it was the one who took the pellets before, but now I lost and he was the one picking up the last pellet, and I have more pacs standing
 RavenKZP: how do i know if my pac is dead?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a tie
 dbf: RavenKZP, it has status 'DEAD' starting from silver league
 AlluringChair: you don't get input from it
 cegprakash: all u need is go to closest pellet + little team cooperation
 Rprades: ah both are 1st
 AlluringChair: oh
 AlluringChair: really?
 Rprades: I got confused because I was in second position
 cegprakash: these two are enough to get gold
 WINWINWIN: @cegprakash any way without a BFS?
 muy31: team coop as in...?
 eulerscheZahl: there has to be some order. writing both on top of each other is unreadable
 muy31: i already have that 
 eulerscheZahl: hail our new leader
 cegprakash: without BFS u deserve in Wood1 WINWINWIN
 Illedan: Damn Csipcsirip :o
 Scarfield: coop as in not going for the same pellets, not trapping own unit and the like
 kovi: nice csipcsirip
 Illedan: The Hungarian top is going to be hard
 Csipcsirip: tyty
 Illedan: That should be barely enough for Legend
 Clagus: damn... and they say that hungarian notation sux...
 cegprakash: if I find a middeway between yesterday's bot and today's bot I'm sure I can improve much higher
 RavenKZP: @dbf thanks somehow i miss it
 cegprakash: I probably have added bugs as I added features
 eulerscheZahl: you are far away from legend Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: fix it
 WINWINWIN: @cegprakash&#160;:) Really no way without BFS?
 Illedan: I will submit later, just chillin
 cegprakash: no WINWINWIN BFS is 4 lines of code
 eulerscheZahl: i know, you code at night
 cegprakash: learn it WINWINWIN
 jrke: hey is sim better than BFS?
 Illedan: Yeah, prime time after 10 PM
 MarekM: some using recursion in silver or higher?
 Illedan: Sure MarekM
 Doju: Umh... does anybody spot the issue here?
 Doju: print(pac, file=sys.stderr)pac.command()
 Doju: it prints a pac object
 cegprakash: BFS can find pellet at 30 distance jrke
 Doju: but says nonetype object is not callable
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph</a>
 cegprakash: if u ca write a sim at depth 30 u donn need BFS
 WINWINWIN: Is this link good for BFS?
 cegprakash: sorry BFS can find npellet even at 100 distance
 eulerscheZahl: or you combine sim with BFS heuristic
 jrke: ya it can infinite if no time limit is there
 cegprakash: u can't go depth 100 using sim
 Doju: MarekM i just implemented a recursive function into my code but still got some bugs
 cegprakash: not in 50 ms
 MarekM: i switch to non recursive algo, in python 3 is way too slow with recursion, now i am under 5 ms per turn, with whole field checked
 WINWINWIN: cegprakash is tutorialspoint a good place to learn BFS?
 Doju: Okay
 cegprakash: just write ur own BFS code without looking tutorial. Learn the concept from youtube WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: all u need is a queue
 jrke: and push
 cegprakash: and u push and pop things out
 cegprakash: it's nothing magical
 AlluringChair: i have been using python since 4 months and i'm still typing null instaed of none...
 cegprakash: damn u are a javascript coder AlluringChair
 Rprades: and multiple at the same time, I am using a modified BFS to return distance of every pac from same pellet
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, for this I will need a 2D array
 WINWINWIN: Uptil now I have been using a 1D array of point objects
 AlluringChair: no, before python i only coded in c c++ and c#
 cegprakash: use both WINWINWIN
 AlluringChair: and i usually just type null and press tab
 cegprakash: or use 2D alone
 AlluringChair: and it gets me the right null name
 AlluringChair: but in python i have to type none xd
 cegprakash: it's not none. It's "None"
 cegprakash: and null is javascript
 AlluringChair: yeah but i type none and press tab for N&#160;:)
 cegprakash: NULL is c++
 Scarfield: you could add neighbors for the point object i suppose WINWINWIN, but 2d arrays are easier to use for stuff thats on a plane imo anyway
 AlluringChair: same with NULL nullptr and other crap
 MarekM: how many people are in GOLD now?
 WINWINWIN: K, will make a full rewrite&#160;:(
 Gafagarion: 401
 MarekM: thx
 MarekM: now i am 26th in silver, may be waiting is enough&#160;:)
 Ramzel: Nope its not
 Beerus: did codin ide always gave warnings?
 Beerus: nice job anyway
 muy31: no Beerus
 eulerscheZahl: we have the Monaco editor now instead of ace
 jrke: hey python vs c++ which has less reponseime t
 struct: ofc you can go depth 100
 jrke: *time
 struct: is the same as depth 30
 struct: it wont do well
 MarekM: anybody uses graph theory? with junctions as vertices?
 Doju: somebody, yes.
 Doju: me? no
 Doju: jrke c++ is much faster
 jrke: K
 cegprakash: jrke there are 4^100 paths at depth 100
 jrke: ya
 eulerscheZahl: there are pruning possibilities
 cegprakash: sorry struct*
 eulerscheZahl: of course you can reach depth 100
 llllllllll: if you died -&gt; skip
 llllllllll: if path is bad -&gt;skip
 eulerscheZahl: just without much exploration
 cegprakash: someone was asking using sim without a BFS
 struct: so 4^30 is possible?
 njaber: can we do parallel computing in our bots? Or is it disabled?
 alinde2: What are you guys running to need c++? Y'all gold league?With javascript and bfs in bfs I'm high silver.. 
 cegprakash: can't prune without a BFS
 struct: good luck
 eulerscheZahl: i can still prune without BFS
 eulerscheZahl: just won't do well
 njaber: Frick there is no info on the performance of bit arrays on google
 njaber: I'm hesitating between taking sha256 ints or bit arrays
 eulerscheZahl: sha256?
 eulerscheZahl: computing hashes?
 njaber: no just for the size of the int
 muy31: ok if i win the next three matches against silver bot im submitting
 njaber: I want to do bitwise operations as fast as possible on large number of bits
 Uljahn: you mean with AVX2?
 njaber:&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: I'd recommend std::bitset if you use c++
 njaber: I'm in c# saddly
 njaber: An I don't have time to convert everything to c++
 Csipcsirip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144349/what-is-the-c-sharp-equivalent-of-stdbitset-of-c">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144349/what-is-the-c-sharp-equivalent-of-stdbitset-of-c</a>
 njaber: Ok doesn't seem like sha256 is really what I'm looking for, I'll see if the parallel implementsations of bitwise data structures are available
 njaber: Yeah I saw those but 32 is way too small, and if I can get a hardware accelerated structure I'll go for that in priority
 njaber: else I'll just resort to BitArray
 MarekM: spatial hashing?&#160;:)
 njaber: not exactly, it's an experiment more then anything
 njaber: Heavy spoilers if it works tho
 njaber: So I'm not gonna go into details
 jrke: hey is 10 turns enough for simming
 jrke: or more
 njaber: Hardware acceleration is on, nice
 struct: all depends
 struct: on the kind of search you use
 Doju: njaber what on earth are you doing hahah
 Doju: hardware acceleration
 njaber: I'm doing things that need as much optimization as possible
 Doju: that was a rhetorical question, no need to respond
 Doju: mmkay
 Doju: that's a solid answer
 eulerscheZahl: that's how we lost struct's last account
 eulerscheZahl: he got mad coding and forgot to submit
 eulerscheZahl: then rage-deleted his account
 jrke: is predicting 10 turns are enough for simulation
 jrke:&#160;?
 njaber: lol, I don't rage, I just like the challenge, but if I fail oh well, I still had fun
 muy31: im raging
 eulerscheZahl: yes jrke. i'm doing 4 turns
 jrke: what
 jrke: means then 6 turns are ok
 eulerscheZahl: wasted
 Hjax: it depends on how sophisticated your scoring is @jrke
 muy31: less turns for less sophisticated
 muy31: so you dont screw yourself over
 Hjax:&#160;? no
 muy31: Hjax yes
 struct: more depth doesnt mean you will get better results
 Hjax: less turns for more sophisticated, because its slower 
 muy31: thats what i said
 muy31: for struct
 muy31: but Hjjax no
 muy31: i mean yes, but logically no
 Hjax: why would you have a simple scoring function with little lookahead? wheres your strength 
 Hjax: either you have a fast simple scoring function, and can do a lot of lookahead 
 Hjax: or you have a complex scoring function, but cant search as deep 
 muy31: no the simple one will screw you...
 muy31: if you look too far
 cegprakash: bye all I should close this tab and go do some coding for what I'm being paid.. 
 cegprakash: this thing is addictive
 struct: Hjax is right
 njaber: yes it is
 njaber: cegprakash
 Doju: yup but this is not a bad thing to be addicted to imo
 Hjax: i took today off from work 
 Hjax: so i could work on this 
 njaber: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: same Hjax
 Doju: unless you're already a coding virtuoso
 muy31: for example... pac thinks there is # pellets 5 moves away, but there is one right next to you. An unsophisticated algo might choose the pellets 5 moves away, but unfortunately they get eaten before you get there
 muy31: but if you gave it less depth you would be more "content" with what's in front of you
 muy31: and probably perform better
 muy31: do I was talking about logic not runtime
 Doju: and this is why i'm not doing a sim
 muy31: *So
 Doju: also python xD
 Uljahn: you could use a discounting factor for future rewards&#160;:/
 muy31: you could, but that makes it more sophisticated does it not?
 muy31: and then you could do a higher depth
 Hjax: when i say sophisticated i dont mean little tweaks like discounting based on depth 
 Hjax: that really wont slow you down much at all 
 Uljahn: ^
 muy31: well whatevs i guess, all of y'all are higher ranked than me anyways
 muy31: im done for the day i think, not getting out of silver
 Uljahn: not really xd
 Doju: uh, what
 Doju: in my function definition i have
 Doju: "existing_targets=set()"
 Doju: oh
 Doju: wait... one sec
 Doju: found it, nevermind
 Doju: aha, just what i expected
 Doju: "RECURSIONRECURS...REC...
 Doju: "times out
 Doju: :D
 MarekM:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i have a feeling most people in gold aren't really improving but just optimizing vs the others in the arena, change my mind
 Hjax: whats the difference 
 Hjax: a win is a win
 IAmNoob: a clean win is not a win
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 muy31: resubmitting my old code, seeing what happens...
 muy31: AntiSquid improving your code is counteractive to your ranking, it's been proven
 AntiSquid: it's ok i have some ideas
 AntiSquid: euler's bot looks like a juicy boss target
 AntiSquid: wonder if cg staff noticed
 Ramzel: Can i chose anyone to fight against?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Ramzel: How to do it?
 AntiSquid: delete opponent in the ide 
 AntiSquid: then select new one
 eulerscheZahl: you can only choose top1000, starting from your own league
 Ramzel: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: so you can't fight gold while in silver. or wood because there are too many players in the contest
 AntiSquid: which sucks imo
 juanotres33: what tutorial made you guys really understand dynamic programming?
 muy31: just practiced it
 muy31: i guess
 muy31: yo just learn the basic constructs at first
 Doju: wait, what?
 muy31: and then you think about how they apply to your situation
 AntiSquid: google, occasionally duckduckgo
 Doju: can you modify a default parameter from inside the function
 Doju: in python
 AntiSquid: yes
 Doju: ohhh okay
 Doju: so i have an empty set as a default value
 AntiSquid: or did you mean smtg else?
 juanotres33: my problem with dp is in constructing constructing the (mathematical) recursion. Recognizing patterns I guess... any tips on how to get better on that?
 Doju: if i call it with no value and then add something to the set
 Doju: (add inside the function)
 Doju: and then call it again with no specified values
 Doju: then the items i added the last time are there?
 AntiSquid: you need an object or variable
 Doju: i do have a variable
 Doju: but i guess it just points to the default value?
 AntiSquid: can make function part of the object
 AntiSquid: use global keyword? not sure what you mean
 Doju: erm
 Doju: def foo(a=set()):
 Doju: b=a
 Doju: b.add("something")
 Doju: then i call that twice
 Doju: and on the second time a contains "something"
 Doju: is that correct?
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://florimond.dev/blog/articles/2018/08/python-mutable-defaults-are-the-source-of-all-evil/">https://florimond.dev/blog/articles/2018/08/python-mutable-defaults-are-the-source-of-all-evil/</a>
 RoboStac: yep
 Doju: oh huh
 Doju: Yeah i agree with the title of that article
 Doju: thanks RoboStac and AntiSquid
 Doju: i think i have these bugs everywhere&#160;:|
 muy31: im so depressed w/ this right now...
 muy31: i just submitted my old code, and am in 258th place, 100th higher than my most recent code
 muy31: i remember a day when i was waiting to promote from 9th place with this same code
 AntiSquid: interesting URL name
 muy31: how is it fair that Clyde-bot gets to keep his rank? but i cant keep mine?
 muy31: silver bot suck about as much as i do
 muy31: i have a question: What determines the score? like 20.XX?
 muy31: how does it work? does resubmitting set you back to 0 and start again, or does it just continue from where you are? 
 RoboStac: it uses the trueskill algorithm
 RoboStac: resubmit starts from scratch (uses first 10 games to roughly place you in the division then you play games vs people close to you in rank)
 Hjax: not sure, i dont think it sets you to zero though
 Zenoscave: Hjax it does
 Hjax: really?
 eulerscheZahl: and the boss doesn't keep the rank. whoever gets above, promotes to gold. league size is increasing
 Hjax: why not just make the variance bigger? 
 muy31: eulerscheZahl it was supposed to be a joke..
 muy31: and wimper
 eulerscheZahl: oh damn, didn't realize to whom i'm replaying
 muy31: sp RoboStac it's about first 10?
 muy31: cause i always lose like 2 in the first ten
 muy31: 2 - 4 variable
 RoboStac: they've got a big effect at the start, but you can still move ranks a lot afterwards
 muy31: does it become harder to promote as more people join as well?
 Hjax: no, it stays the same difficulty, because the boss doesnt get better 
 Illedan: Might be harder, as some bots are stronger vs others
 AntiSquid: .-.   | OO| |   | '^^^'
 muy31: but there's no way someone w/ lazy/simple heuristics is getting better than other players even if we are all better than boss
 AntiSquid: where are the pacman ghosts
 Illedan: Add ghosts and remove fog of war :P
 AntiSquid: ghosts trains&#160;!

 muy31: last submit of the day?, 4 losses in first 15 battles
 SkyDreamer: can someone help me
 llllllllll: with?
 SkyDreamer: can i write a function in java that swaps the value of 2 int variables everytime i call it?
 llllllllll: I guess so
 SkyDreamer: a function i know returns a value, not the swap
 isdemus: what do you mean by return a swap?
 muy31: make the int variables static or something,
 muy31: or global
 muy31: you cant swap primitives as parameters
 muy31: but you can if they are global variables
 muy31: example: functionName(int a, int b){
 muy31: a = a +b;
 muy31: }
 muy31: but a stays the same after method is called
 muy31: but if they are not parameters but rather global variables you can do it
 muy31: so functionName(int a, int b){a = a +b;}
 muy31: so functionName(int a, int b){a = a +b;}
 muy31: *oops
 muy31: messed up
 muy31: int a = 0;
 SkyDreamer: but at the end of that funcion i must return something
 muy31: unctionName( int b){a = a +b;}
 muy31: make it void
 muy31: ooh yes, in the 100s again! (silver)
 SkyDreamer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d7bdfc0-b99b-4672-8339-eb27a37c4828">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d7bdfc0-b99b-4672-8339-eb27a37c4828</a>
 SkyDreamer: but it doesnt swap
 muy31: it wont work
 muy31: yeah b/c primitive data types as parameters
 k4ng0u: is the initial number of ppl in legend fixed or does it depend on the number of participants?
 muy31: it will only work with reference types and objects if you want ou use a and b as a parameters
 VicHofs: yo superstars
 VicHofs: any ideas how to improve in bronze from this gameplay? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464502929">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464502929</a>
 muy31: otherwise SkyDreamer you need to make a and b global variables
 VicHofs: I keep getting close calls like this and have run out of ideas
 SkyDreamer: thanks
 muy31: VicHofs you are wasting your speed
 muy31: you need to choose a location at least two cells away
 muy31: for you to use it
 VicHofs: huh
 VicHofs: ok thanks
 VicHofs: I don't know how to use it properly
 muy31: frames 22 - 26 or so
 VicHofs: I was using if off cooldown
 muy31: use it off sppedTurnsLeft
 VicHofs: *it
 muy31: speedTurnsLeft &gt; 0
 muy31: using speed
 Scarfield: you get to move 2 cells per turn when speed is active, but if you only target a cell one cell away, you will only move one cell
 muy31: also VicHofs you don't always choose the best pellet, either, you might want to keep track of where you know for sure there are no pellets
 muy31: many times though you ass up visible pellets
 muy31: *pass
 VicHofs: I do that already tho
 VicHofs: keeping track of no pellets that is
 VicHofs: might not be working properly tho
 muy31: perhaps
 muy31: but dont pass up perfectly good pellets
 VicHofs: ty anyway
 VicHofs: I think i have an idea what might be contributing
 muy31: good luck&#160;:)
 MSmits: errm, with some luck i could be gold boss, but more likely i will just get stuck under it :P
 eulerscheZahl: i hope for a PHP boss
 MSmits: that would be smart
 MSmits: my bot is not a good choice
 eulerscheZahl: you are too low anyways i think
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: 17 now
 eulerscheZahl: i fear that i have a good rank
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't want to be the boss :fearful:
 MSmits: they dont pick rank 7 for gold boss do they?
 MSmits: i thought it was more like 15?
 eulerscheZahl: for OOC it was 8
 MSmits: oh really
 MSmits: explains why it was so hard to beat i guess
 eulerscheZahl: they considered dbdr first. but IDE timeouts for a boss? nope
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: in 30min we will know
 dbdr: you say they considerd because Apo commented on my indenting?
 MSmits: thats probably bad yeah
 MSmits: is something wrong with your indenting?
 dbdr: destroyed by my byndler
 eulerscheZahl: because they commented on you timing out and that that's the reason you aren't the boss i think
 dbdr: my source is beautiful of course&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: on which day was legend opened?
 MSmits: but you are still *a* boss though dbdr
 dbdr: using tabs, as God intended&#160;;)
 dbdr: lol MSmits
 MSmits: ah, my tabs are atheist
 dbdr: but you are stilling a coding God, MSmits&#160;;)
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 dbdr: *still
 RockyMullet: if your a god a believe in yourself, it makes you a theist
 dbdr: MSmits you are in the coin flip zone for legend it seems
 RockyMullet: self esteem is important
 MSmits: I wont get legend immediately I think
 MSmits: but often something happens to cause a flood
 dbdr: better to prepare for that
 MSmits: a submitter that has RPS vs gold voss
 MSmits: boss
 dbdr: I would be very happy if I do
 eulerscheZahl: [CG]SaiksyApo: dbdr il a tellement de caractères qu'il doit supprimer l'indentation apparement è_é
 dbdr: yeah, top gold should be fine. though sometimes the boss starts climbing as well
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: we'll see
 dbdr: yeah. not sure if I had to, or my budler just did it anyway. it also included the unit tests in the submission :D
 eulerscheZahl: and his next sentence: Then you will stay in Gold&#160;!
 llllllllll: ah I LOVE IT SO MUCH when I timeout and my debug messages are not printed
 llllllllll: even if I put it in the first line of the game loop
 eulerscheZahl: timeout in game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464473429">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464473429</a>games parsed: 136     timeouts found: 1
 eulerscheZahl: that's acceptable i guess
 MSmits: I have them sometimes too, but I dont know why
 MSmits: pretty rare though
 llllllllll: yeah it is
 llllllllll: which makes it specially annoying
 dbdr: lol, now you are above me MSmits
 dbdr: 0.01 between 4 bots
 MSmits: damn
 Uljahn: llllllllll: put them after the first inputs in the loop also add flush=True if it's py3
 MSmits: my bot is weird though. I did a submit that ended at 170 as well
 MSmits: it does relatively well against top bots
 MSmits: but I still get trap-killed a lot
 llllllllll: @Uljahn now its C++ &amp; I have a print after each function call in the game loop. still nothing is printed
 MSmits: I'm not touching my submit until after legend opens
 eulerscheZahl: same
 VicHofs: ty muy31
 YvanTCHOUDIE: Hello everyone
 AntiSquid: looks like everyone is getting their best bot out of their cupboard
 alinde2: I'm climbing a rank every couple of minutes, just gotta wait it out eh? 42@silver
 AntiSquid: python at #27 , is that the boss&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, too low
 AntiSquid: maybe they gonna take it and improve it
 MSmits: if they pick the php, things will get really painful
 eulerscheZahl: PHP at 4 is too highsome C#/Java around 10-15
 MSmits: C#/java, might not be better than just c++
 MSmits: many will use the full calc time
 eulerscheZahl: or JS. but that's low again
 MSmits: bah I'm dropping
 eulerscheZahl: you shall not pass!
 MSmits: I shall!
 eulerscheZahl: i want to see you suffer :popcorn:
 MSmits: :cry:
 eulerscheZahl: for shooting at my submarine
 MSmits: oh, right that one
 MSmits: this is a pretty random ladder,  just like ooc
 dbdr: some bots suffer in gold, but then zip through great positions in legend...
 Illedan: 17-18 is a god spot to pick the boss
 dbdr: why?
 eulerscheZahl: i bet it will be around 10
 Illedan: 24-25 score is very close
 AntiSquid: fingers crossed for top 5 legend
 Illedan: Need the score around 25.5
 eulerscheZahl: 25.5 promotes like half of gold
 MSmits: back in a bit, someone push me while I am gone
 AntiSquid: push down
 VicHofs: petition to make it a win if a player gets 69 pellets
 icecream17: no, do it when a player has 0 pellets but 100 turns have passed
 VicHofs: that's fine too but dude
 VicHofs: 69
 VicHofs: lmao
 icecream17: 69 turns
 icecream17: oh well submit
 icecream17: wow it's updating fast
 Uljahn: time to make some mass promotions in csb :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: where is my boss? :fork: :knife:
 eulerscheZahl: no fork?
 eulerscheZahl: :spoon:
 Scarfield: there is no spoon
 icecream17: the fork is lost in the cake
 dbdr: late by several seconds already! ourageous!
 SurajMishra2209: I have made all the improvements I could and I still cannot get out of bronze
 SurajMishra2209: I am giving up
 Doju: Don't give up SurajMishra2209
 VicHofs: ooh don't give up dude
 VicHofs: I suck too
 Uljahn: ye, just gid gud ezpz
 dbf: SurajMishra2209, don't give up, silver doesn't require complex code, just make sure that there are now visible errors
 jrke: does legend open yet
 Doju: ^ words of wisdom right there
 Doju: (dbf)
 Doju: xD
 icecream17: This is aargh. I lose 5x times more often if I lost last time in the submit battles
 VicHofs: not sure if I agree
 eulerscheZahl: yes jrke. any minute now
 Doju: VicHofs is your code timing out?
 VicHofs: nope Doju
 VicHofs: I just suck
 Doju: are your pacs collaborating?
 VicHofs: lmao
 VicHofs: what does that mean
 Doju: at least not crashing into eachother
 Doju: for extended periods of time
 Doju: and not following eachother
 VicHofs: yeah they don't crash
 VicHofs: I can't stop them from following yet tho...
 Doju: that not following thing was key for me to getting to silver
 VicHofs: any tips?
 Doju: do you have a pathfinding thing working?
 Doju: (bfs perhaps)
 daanolav: So does anyone know how late legend is opening?
 Hjax: soon™
 Illedan: Any time now
 BenjaminUrquhart: make kovi the boss /s
 eulerscheZahl: i want a PHP boss
 BenjaminUrquhart: but the php guy is 4th
 Csipcsirip: c# would be much better
 BenjaminUrquhart: ey
 eulerscheZahl: boss
 BenjaminUrquhart: java boss
 wlesavo: yay
 BenjaminUrquhart: Npi2Loup
 wlesavo: big legend
 eulerscheZahl: yay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/shgjyw">https://prnt.sc/shgjyw</a>
 Illedan: 25.5 :tada:
 Illedan: Told ya&#160;;)
 BenjaminUrquhart: MSmits you just missed it
 eulerscheZahl: will blow up quickly
 Illedan: :clap: eulerscheZahl
 Rprades: 15 ppl to legend i tseems
 eulerscheZahl: 16
 wlesavo: so Npi2Loup is the boss?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I believe so
 jrke: 16
 BenjaminUrquhart: or it's another java bot that so happened to have the same score as him
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464552384">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/464552384</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464551779">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464551779</a>
 Illedan: Random boss?
 Hjax: looks deterministic 
 eulerscheZahl: i thought my replays show the opposite?
 dbdr: now we see the real ranking free of spam?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no, someone will spam before it finishes
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: 0.32 rating below gold
 Illedan: haha
 eulerscheZahl: and late promotions
 MSmits: thats  like 3 games
 dbdr: ValGrowth back to #1
 kovi: finally we will have a real eval
 kovi: with best versions and quite a few games
 MSmits: 0.17 below gold boss
 MSmits: karliso promoted
 eulerscheZahl: and 2 players already resubmitted
 dbdr: 3
 eulerscheZahl: you too dbdr?
 AlluringChair: can i somehow get the board in text #  #... so i can test it locally?
 dbdr: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: print it
 dbdr: XL* karli* Jir*tech
 eulerscheZahl: your second one is a promotion actually
 dbdr: and w*la
 eulerscheZahl: not a resubmit
 dbdr: ah possible
 dbdr: sry
 solaimanope: will one get promoted if it's better than boss when BATTLES IN PROGRESS
 eulerscheZahl: no
 RockyMullet: good legend is out, time to bump my face a couple of times on that gate
 dbdr: 3 HU in top 5 :D happy kovi?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you don't like the boss?
 Illedan: I'll join RockyMullet
 dbdr: 3 in top 3
 dbdr: ok, chnging too fast
 RockyMullet: good good
 MSmits: You are better than the boss! You will be promoted to Legend League
 RockyMullet: ok first game in IDE I win, I might be lucky by spamming the submits :P
 dbdr: yay, gg MSmits!
 wlesavo: nice MSmits 
 RockyMullet: gg MSmits
 MSmits: no resubmit needed&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks
 RockyMullet: resubmits are for losers
 RockyMullet: like me...
 <b>**RockyMullet plays violon</b></p><p><img src="/a/43448306132121" /> dbdr: I have submitted since yesterday morning :D
 MSmits: first time i get to legend this way. All previous time I was either above boss, or i got it like 2 days later
 RockyMullet: ok trying my luck
 RockyMullet: THEN I'll code
 AlluringChair: i'm probably dumb but how can i print the board, the console only shows 1 line and i can't print another..
 MSmits: luck before code?
 icecream17: save each line in an array
 RockyMullet: AlluringChair you can print in the errors
 Doju: yeah you need to print in the errors
 RockyMullet: MSmits yes, cause luck is easy
 MSmits: if you're lucky&#160;:)
 alinde2: 30 silver, now winnings against ide bot. Gotta re-submit :grin:
 AlluringChair: that stil wil be 1 line, \n doesn't work&#160;:/
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85b886e4-d0f5-4166-997f-b331bfcbb796">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85b886e4-d0f5-4166-997f-b331bfcbb796</a>
 RockyMullet: :four_leaf_clover:
 RockyMullet: gl alinde2
 AlluringChair: i guess i will separate it later...
 icecream17: Alluringchair see the pastebin
 Doju: hmm
 RockyMullet: oh this luck thing is not looking good lol
 kovi: we will have good baseline cgstat
 RockyMullet: oh wait, the luck is coming back
 Waffle3z: how small is legend?
 MSmits: 20
 MSmits: 21
 RockyMullet: oh, nice
 RockyMullet: not one of those "10 people in legend"
 RockyMullet: so you're telling me there's a chance&#160;!?!?!?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 MSmits: this game is pretty random. Get in range of gold boss so you get some battles against him. Overfit vs the boss, then chain submit
 RockyMullet: trolling aside, I might be able to get legend
 eulerscheZahl: even for 10 in legend, there is a chance - as these 10 prove
 RockyMullet: yeah depends if I'm already in the downward spiral of "every I do make it worse" which is, for now, not the case :P
 MSmits: hope I am not there either... havent really improved much since monday
 MSmits: even though i did some pretty cool stuff in my bot. It just didnt help :P
 RockyMullet: yah, I fixed so many edge case that happens once every 100 games, its nice, but doesnt affect the rank much
 solaimanope: "even though i did some pretty cool stuff in my bot. It just didnt help" sums up my last two days :3
 MSmits: right
 RockyMullet: rn most of my game I lose because when tehre is not much pellet left, it takes too much time for me to find them, so I work on my deduction of where enemies have most likely already taken the pellets
 RockyMullet: should help
 MSmits: yes, thats on my list as well
 MSmits: and finally try to kill and avoid dying :P
 RockyMullet: knowledge is power :sunglasses:
 MSmits: ye
 Rprades: same for me RokcyMullet
 Rprades: that is my bottleneck right now
 RockyMullet: yah, Rprades, I improved my early gathering A LOT but then I slowly lose if it goes late game
 RockyMullet: which is usually the case against good bot
 RockyMullet: so unless I kill pacs (which my bot is ok at) I lose the long games
 MSmits: you check for dead-end kills RockyMullet?
 RockyMullet: yes
 kovi: tiber has nice lead, 2-4 is pretty equal
 MSmits: did you test how much stronger your bot is with the kill thing RockyMullet?
 RockyMullet: hum ahrd to tell, I did that a couple days ago
 Peudoki: time to join the legends for me hopefully
 RockyMullet: but it doenst happen everygame
 MSmits: I am going to check the last battles and see how many times it happens to me.
 wlesavo: 24 already
 MSmits: do an accurate count
 wlesavo: looks promising
 RockyMullet: I dont activly check for a kill, its just if I see an enemy in a dead end that I can reach before they can exit, I go for it
 Peudoki: half the games done, 0.67 ahead of boss
 Peudoki: 0.49 now
 MSmits: RockyMullet thats exactly what i mean
 RockyMullet: I seen a game once where it wasnt the right choice tho, I was losing by like 3 pellets and chased for the kill while I could have taken pellets and win
 RockyMullet: killing an enemy pac is not as valuable late game
 k4ng0u: never chase in end game :P
 RockyMullet: yeah, I could probably do some dumb check like "if im that close from the end, dont go for kill"
 k4ng0u: I read somewhere that you could divide the pellets left by the number of alive pacs to get an approximation of the value of killing a pac
 MSmits: makes total sense
 RockyMullet: yeah, not a bad idea
 Doju: isn't it double that?
 Doju: since they can't collect pellets and you can if their pac is dead
 MSmits: doesnt matter, there will be a constant anyway
 Doju: sure
 MSmits: if the value is doubled, the constant will also and you will fit the constant
 jrke: now tommorow we can make out who will be the winner 
 Kellthazar: if myScore &lt; enemyScore, dont ignore the enemypac
 Kellthazar: ops, I mean the oposite
 Doju: It took me 8 hours to code a simple collaborative targeting thing ...
 MSmits: most of my losses are corner kills where I dont know my opponent is around the corner =/
 Kellthazar: yeah
 WINWINWIN: SIlver boss occasionally has timeouts, is that ok?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it's fine
 Doju: luckily i can quickly adapt it to work for paths too
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is just another player like you and me
 AlluringChair: i have just wasted nearly  3 hours of my life because deque in python with pop() works like a stack
 Doju: you need to do popleft()
 AlluringChair: THANKS
 AlluringChair: I KNOW
 Doju: sorry xd
 AlluringChair: why name it DEQUE if it might as well be a stack..
 Doju: double ended queue?
 AlluringChair: e maybe i;m just tilted beyond reasoning now
 kovi: very random. top6 is in a bunch now
 Peudoki: I'm 0.00 behind the boss, nooo!
 Peudoki: can't get to legend
 MSmits: so.. .you have floating point issues?
 Peudoki: we're both at 25.23 when I finished my games
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: Peudoki, the first one of you to win a game will be 1st
 MSmits: so just win your next game
 MSmits: and hope he loses his
 eulerscheZahl: your score has more decimal digits than shown
 Peudoki: I have no games left though
 eulerscheZahl: others submit
 MSmits: players will play against you..
 Doju: yeah Peudoki just hype your bot up
 NinjaDoggy: :O he did it
 MSmits: .and against the boss
 NinjaDoggy: the boss lost
 Peudoki: it happened! I'm legend!
 Doju: gratz
 MSmits: grats&#160;:)
 NickStahl: Peudoki congrats
 Peudoki: well
 Peudoki: in 30 sec
 Peudoki: I have to wait it out
 Peudoki: and hold
 MSmits: no
 ZarthaxX: nah you cant 
 MSmits: if it gives a popup, you're in
 ZarthaxX: once u get that msg you promote
 ZarthaxX: even if you resubmit
 Peudoki: it's official!
 eulerscheZahl: it was before
 Ramzel: YEY GOLD&#160;!
 WINWINWIN: well donw Peudoki, Ramzel
 Peudoki: thank you
 NickStahl: Ramzel congratz
 Peudoki: I'm dead last in legend, but I'm here ^^
 Peudoki: the smallest legend known to humanity
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 MSmits: it will grow
 MSmits: it's always small at first
 eulerscheZahl: 44 at the end of the contest for code of ice and fire, 49 for mean max
 MSmits: this one will be bigger
 eulerscheZahl: this one will exceed 100 i think
 Peudoki: 100 legends? :O
 eulerscheZahl: just wait till monday

 kovi: its hard to climb with 55% winrates
 Doju: only 2 days left... i guess it's time for bad coding 
 Doju: ctrl + c and ctrl + v to the rescue
 wlesavo: does legend feels less random?
 kovi: not at all
 WINWINWIN: I dont understand what you mean by random wlesavo
 WINWINWIN: Are all the bots deterministic in legend?
 Xlos: Alright I'm finally beating inky's butt
 Xlos: silver here we come
 wlesavo: WINWINWIN random pac deaths are almost unavoidable, so it can result in a loss with nothing you can do about it
 Rprades: 26% battles and beating the boss!
 Rprades: hope it lasts until 100%
 WINWINWIN: Thanks wlesavo, understand now
 wlesavo: Rprades quite huge advantage actually, 1 point above the boss
 Rprades: just lost 7 in a row&#160;:(
 Ramzel: Is there a way to fall a rank down?
 wlesavo: i think you will make it anyway
 Ramzel: league down*
 Rprades: thanks for the trust wlesavo
 wlesavo: Ramzel no, only in test mode
 Quidome: Legend is already big, congrats guys
 Quidome: Well played&#160;:)
 mpt: still got 800ms to spent on precalc. What should I use it on, I wonder.
 kovi: increase depth of 1st turn action
 jacek: make opening book
 mpt: thanks for the input
 NinjaDoggy: mtp
 NinjaDoggy: calculate cuts/trapping :P
 MSmits: cuts&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: you mean dead-ending  a pac?
 NinjaDoggy: yep
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: stil havent coded that
 MSmits: seems fairly easy, but it will add more mess to my mess
 NinjaDoggy: how's the enemy tracking going now?
 MSmits: I dunno.. I have something that works, but it doesnt help me win more
 eulerscheZahl: trapping is fun
 MSmits: i mainly try not to die around corners, but it makes my pacs afraid to go around corners :P
 eulerscheZahl: i try to kill around corners :imp:
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl have you reduced your trapping? I saw a replay from you where you had 2 pacs travel quite far to kill another pac... thats pretty costly
 eulerscheZahl: i still do it
 MSmits: do you take into account the cost though? For example near end games?
 NinjaDoggy: evil euler :imp:
 eulerscheZahl: no, i just like kills
 MSmits: lol ok
 NinjaDoggy: LOl
 MSmits: it seems pretty complicated to code with multiple pacs involved
 MSmits: dead ends are pretty easy
 eulerscheZahl: like this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464470922">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464470922</a>
 MSmits: yes that
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: helo
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: 14
 eulerscheZahl: it's not that hard to code if you are happy catching 95% of the cases
 MSmits: you also need to take into account your other pacs blocking your trap
 MSmits: stuff like that
 eulerscheZahl: and that's where i screw up :D
 MSmits: hehe ok
 NinjaDoggy: hm...
 MSmits: thats my problem. I see a problem I dont know how to fix and then I dont code an less effective version that would still work 95%
 RockyMullet: hu, I could probably improve my "kill in dead ends" algo to make traps like that
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: where did the button where u can join a random 15min clash go
 Nerchio: do we know who is the gold boss?
 NinjaDoggy: wait you didn't detect trap on frame 33 but did on fram 37?
 NinjaDoggy: you have to have a pac next to them? lame -_-
 eulerscheZahl: npi2 is the boss
 NinjaDoggy: that's not 95% :P
 CodingCarter: 2 hours b4 AP Computer Science A!
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy
 MSmits: it's cooldowns
 MSmits: the opponent can switch
 MSmits: then you cant trap him
 NinjaDoggy: oh nvm i'm dumb&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: but you can also switch!
 NinjaDoggy: ha! lame -_-
 MSmits: yes, but that doesnt work
 MSmits: the one who switches first loses
 MSmits: you get a standoff
 MSmits: takes too much time, tying up two pacs vs his one
 MSmits: not good
 NinjaDoggy: true
 NinjaDoggy: but he doens't care, he just wants kills
 MSmits: thats true. Out of character euler, you should park two pacs and wait
 eulerscheZahl: hey, i won the game
 NinjaDoggy: :P
 eulerscheZahl: i also saw my bot doing this in turn 2 with bad start locations
 MSmits: yeah... seen plenty of those
 MSmits: all games I lose 
 DiegoVega: can anyone tell me how the starting positions are chosen? is it truely random or there is a fairness involved so that your pac is not in an impossible starting position?
 dbdr: it's fair since it's symmetrical
 Peudoki: my AI just went on a winning stream of 13
 Peudoki: crazy rampage
 Peudoki: streak*
 MSmits: I turned that mode off... felt like cheating
 Doju: :D

 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl "i also saw my bot doing this in turn 2 with bad start locations" can u show me
 eulerscheZahl: didn't save it
 struct: Need top 100 in CSB for mod
 eulerscheZahl: sqiddy got that?
 NinjaDoggy: i don't believe it
 NinjaDoggy: not 1 bit
 struct: yes
 cegprakash: what is it about eulerscheZahl
 struct: rank 91
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: h
 daanolav: i don't even know what i can do to improve my bot anymore, that's how bad i designed it in the first place
 Jesus_inn_party: sup every one
 Doju: sup jesus
 cegprakash: out off topic: have anyone worked on "sign in with google" on backend? I need help
 jrke: hey i wanna ask one thing in c++ suppose their is nested loop and if command break; then it will  exit from all loop or one
 eulerscheZahl: and you can't google for help because you aren't signed in?
 eulerscheZahl: jrke for my prof that's the only acceptable use of goto
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl too many documents
 cegprakash: don't know which one is right
 jrke: K euler thanks
 struct: it only breaks the current loop
 struct: not nested
 EvModder: :O they added a new arena
 EvModder: time to submit again and hope i make the cut
 eulerscheZahl: which arena?
 eulerscheZahl: i see no new multiplayer game
 EvModder: legend
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 jrke: hey when i add goto to switch it time out else works why is this in c++
 struct: How does your switch looks?
 EvModder: idk, should work. i dont use gotos much personall
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/81jcYTqL">https://pastebin.com/81jcYTqL</a>
 jrke: my switch
 struct: you need break; on switchs
 jrke: same timeout then also
 jrke: what can i do 
 cegprakash: goto guy spotted
 jrke: means
 cegprakash: if something works ship it
 jrke: Ceg i didn't get you
 [Csongor]: The boss just timed out...is that normal?
 cegprakash: you've to type "goto cegprakash;" to get to me
 eulerscheZahl: yes, the boss can timeout too
 cegprakash: probably eulerscheZahl is the boss
 EvModder: noob boss lol
 EvModder: what causes it to timeout?
 jrke: hey anybody to my ques plz 
 cegprakash: EvModder thinking
 cegprakash: thinnking too much
 EvModder: i dont beleive in thinking
 [Csongor]: the boss timed out again
 struct: jrke what is s4?
 EvModder: link to game?
 cegprakash: [Csongor] definitely it's eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: if it timeouts often
 cegprakash: let me guess there are 4 or 5 pacs
 jrke: its just an int s4
 struct: What is this switch supposed to do&#160;?
 struct: What do you want to do?
 jrke: i am using it for sim
 struct: Yes but what is it meant to do?
 jrke: its one of my 6 switch to read all possibilities for next 6 turns
 jrke: how can i solve this probleme
 jrke: *problem
 struct: are you using goto to exit switch?
 jrke: break and goto both timeout
 Counterbalance: jrke you forgot the break;
 jrke: nope its also giving timeout
 eulerscheZahl: the goto is conditional
 eulerscheZahl: you still need an unconditional break
 jrke: means
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait... just poorly formatted
 RoboStac: no, it's outside the {} so it's the same as break
 Counterbalance: right
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, congrats with legend, boss is in java, so you are happy?&#160;:)
 Rprades: come on 
 eulerscheZahl: no, i wanted PHP
 Rprades: first after the gold boss
 Rprades: haha
 jrke: whats wrong in this code
 Rprades: story of my life
 RoboStac: theres nothing wrong (other than the formatting) with that code jrke 
 jrke: so what i am suppose to do?
 Counterbalance: might be because there are no bounds checks here so maybe you're accessing somearray[-1]&#160;?
 dbf: Rprades, just leave your bot overnight and check tomorrow morning&#160;:)
 Rprades: do you think that without submiitting there is a chance to get promoted? if he loses more than me?
 Rprades: thanks dbf, that is what I was asking
 Rprades: I wont resubmit then
 eulerscheZahl: odds are good to get pushed
 eulerscheZahl: only submit if you have a real improvement
 dbf: the gap is not small, but there is allways a chance for #1
 dbf: yes, don't resubmit old code
 eulerscheZahl: how big is the gap?
 Rprades: thanks&#160;:)
 Rprades: 0.9
 dbf: 0/85
 eulerscheZahl: still in range of random
 Rprades: crossing my fingers
 dbf: close the leaderboard, start working on large improvement and check tomorrow&#160;:)
 dbf: (pro-tip from a person who was never in legend, lol)
 Rprades: haha
 Rprades: thanks
 cegprakash: dbdr it doesn't work lol.. small iffs are the ones making diff atleast to me
 Illedan: Open the webpage in Inspect. Remove chat, ranking and leaderboard. Continue to work.
 eulerscheZahl: add ?disableChat to the URL, way easier
 dbf: wow
 Illedan: Wont remove leaderboard and ranking
 struct: Just dont submit
 dbf: so I need +4 scores, looks like a major improvement is required&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i like the idea of removing that distraction too
 HiIamFriend: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464686757">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464686757</a> Aham, what was that
 Illedan: I removed those on that 4 hour sprint :P
 cegprakash: Illedan I'd love an extension for that
 eulerscheZahl: looking at the rank too often despite knowing it's meaningless
 Illedan: ^
 HiIamFriend: how do u beat that :DDD
 HiIamFriend: explain pls
 MSmits: it's a special move. Output SLURP_PELLETS
 Illedan: I wish this game had a 5 BFS ranged vision instead of along the lines -.-
 HiIamFriend: hmm
 MSmits: HiIamFriend i am kidding... you timed out
 dbf: Illedan, so you can use more code from unleash the geek?&#160;:)
 HiIamFriend: ow :D
 MSmits: meaning you didnt provide a proper command
 Illedan: Or OoC :P
 HiIamFriend: thanks :D
 MSmits: np&#160;:)
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/81jcYTqL">https://pastebin.com/81jcYTqL</a>hey anybody just solve this problem plzi am getting timeout on applying break or goto statement and works without break and goto why?
 MarekM: jrke: which language?
 jrke: c++
 MarekM: Use of goto statement is highly discouraged because it makes difficult to trace the control flow of a program, making the program hard to understand and hard to modify. Any program that uses a goto can be rewritten so that it doesn't need the goto.
 struct: jrke I think someone already mentioned the possible problem
 jrke: hey but break is also not working
 MichaelVonWolfen: Try and change that switch to if statements
 struct: if px - 1 == -1
 struct: you gonna check array[-1]
 jrke: K
 Doju: oh great, my pacs see ghosts
 HiIamFriend: so if i am rank1 what does that mean O_o "last battles"
 NapTown: then you're promoted
 HiIamFriend: so i wrote a single line code and i won&#160;? thats weird
 Illedan: what league?
 HiIamFriend: nvmd, wood league
 HiIamFriend: i am not first now
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Wood is introduction
 HiIamFriend: wood 1 :D
 HiIamFriend: this is a fun website tbh
 HiIamFriend: i was searching to code for fun
 Nerchio: welcome&#160;!
 HiIamFriend: ty 
 AntiSquid: hey was away, how many did get promoted initially&#160;?
 RoboStac: 16
 cegprakash: AntiSquid I think eulerscheZahl's timeouting bot is th eboss
 AntiSquid: java
 cegprakash: oh then Npi2Loup may be
 HiIamFriend: does enemy is represented by "#" or no&#160;? 
 cegprakash: no HiIamFriend
 cegprakash: # is wall
 [Csongor]: the walls
 HiIamFriend: k
 wlesavo: ceg teaching about the rules :smirk:
 cegprakash: enemy is represented by mine=false
 cegprakash: I get helped from CG community, I give it back
 cegprakash: so never troll CEG
 wlesavo: CeG
 ashikujjaman: which algo is best for silver league?
 Peudoki: anything people use in gold and legend
 wlesavo: btw, cegprakash, what does your nickname mean? is it an actual word?
 cegprakash: I studied at CEG
 cegprakash: but everyone in my college call me CEG coz of my handle
 cegprakash: so I started using it everywhere
 cegprakash: and when I came to CG everyone started calling me CEG as well
 wlesavo: is prakash your lastname then?
 cegprakash: firstnname 
 wlesavo: oh i see
 cegprakash: I don't have a lastname
 struct: if you have a firstname you have a last name
 Doju: hm
 Doju: hah
 Peudoki: you can have only one name
 Peudoki: that isn't the last
 Doju: wdym
 Doju: i have 3 names that aren't the last
 AntiSquid: but what about 1 first name and 20 middle names?
 [Csongor]: 3 nicknames
 wlesavo: struct sounds like a programmer would say
 wlesavo: like smth
 wlesavo: nice Illedan 
 Rprades: yes! congrats!
 Rprades: that give me hope,  now I am 0.5 away!
 dbf: :thumbsup:
 ameler: gg Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: legend is too crowded already, can we get a new league?
 dbf: yes, if you take gold boss with you
 Hjax: In 2 days 12 hours the last league opens, its called champion :P
 kovi: why wait so long, do it now
 wlesavo: 40 ppl already wow
 Jesus_inn_party: how do you know this much stuff?
 Nerchio: i wish submits were faster so i can spam submit and hope for a lucky legend run
 Astrobytes: cegprakash "I don't have a last name" - yes you do and I know what it is :P
 Illedan: w00t
 Illedan: Still my code from last saturday with isdead tweak :D Just changed some numbers lol
 Colios13: Tourist is coming :astonished:
 Illedan: Nice
 Illedan: Rank 3k
 Illedan: :D
 fatrujilloa: Guys I keep getting timed out but I am not sure where the problem comes from... any hints in how to find the problem?
 Doju: print everything
 Doju: except if you print too much make sure it doesn't time out because of that
 Waffle3z: made a change and submitted. 22nd to 175th. resubmitted. 1st
 MarekM: measure time on code segments
 fatrujilloa: I am doing it... it gets to the end of the dycle actually :S 
 fatrujilloa: How do you measure time?
 Astrobytes: Psyho, tourist... who else will join
 Illedan: psycho didn't do much right?
 fatrujilloa: I am using Python
 Astrobytes: In gold last time I looked
 MarekM: start = time.time()
 MarekM: then same at finish
 fatrujilloa: Thx!
 MarekM: substract and print
 Doju: it's hilarious that if you google "pacman mouth angle"
 Doju: it actually gives you the answer
 Astrobytes: Still have a small bet with myself that dapo will show up at the end :D
 Doju: in one of those little handy quick answers
 kovi: quite a few topcoder marathonists play
 kovi: i envy how fast romka descended
 Illedan: Astrobytes :D
 kovi: at this point my vote is on karliso
 Illedan: I vote for T1024
 NapTown: Betrayus switch counter:worried:
 Illedan: Or myself if I every get this code working xD
 eulerscheZahl: i bet karlis o too
 eulerscheZahl: no Illedan. you just aren't a contest killer
 Illedan: I know, my motivation was done last saturday :P
 Illedan: I still have 3 beers and a redbull. Will see what the night brings
 Astrobytes: that's some submit by Romk a
 MattSOrme: I thought id made loads of improvements. Played against the boss and won a couple games without paying much attention to anything but the final score. Submitted and list 600 places...
 eulerscheZahl: headache for the next morning
 Illedan: Used to that
 MattSOrme: All of the cool stuff that i had working this morning, was broken by the stuff i did this afternoon&#160;:(
 cegprakash: I think the rate at which I stare at leaderboard has been increased since the leaderboard fast updating from CG
 Astrobytes: lol, it is a significant improvement
 struct: Romk a with a new bot?
 Astrobytes: It's impressive
 Doju: what on earth
 Doju: my pac updating method is so broken. How has it worked till now
 Doju: Or maybe it hasnt&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: lol just noticed it's a top 10 Hungarian takeover :D 
 kovi: psyho playing btw
 MarekM: gold league, after all, in the middle of debugging&#160;:)
 EvModder: did all of the other top players get a lot better since yesterday or did i get a lot worse lol
 EvModder: probably both xD
 MarekM: or out of luck
 EvModder: ya i agree. i will blame luck
 Adnmaster: so you work in google
 Adnmaster: nice
 AntiSquid: he is part of the search engine itself
 Icebox: he *is* the search engine
 EvModder: kind of ironically, i dont think my pellet search algorithm is much good
 DevLugo: Hello!, about the batman binary search...How i know the current position of batman?
 Icebox: you track it
 Icebox: yourself
 Opeyevil: Am i able to move Coders strike back into visual sutdios to play and debug properly? i still dont understand why next checkpoint x and y change with every loop. 
 DevLugo: ok i think i have an idea. Thanks!
 cegprakash: yes u can Opeyevil
 cegprakash: that's what most of us do Opeyevil
 tobk: Huh, what's the story behind the Gold boss? Never been much into the Lore of Pacman...
 Opeyevil: how do i move the cins from the website to my ide? only been coding for 1 year so noob
 eulerscheZahl: what's the name?
 tobk: jup
 Opeyevil: is there an API i can access?
 Hjax: Lord Betrayus @eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: betray us, interesting :D
 eulerscheZahl: Opeyevil <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/debugging">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/debugging</a>
 cegprakash: Opeyevil use cerr
 tobk: haven't seen it play yet, maybe a reference to the tactics. just came back here
 eulerscheZahl: for CSB it is probably easier to import a single turn
 eulerscheZahl: they usually decide about the names before choosing a bot
 cegprakash: Opeyevil just print to cerr and copy paste it to ur input file
 Doju: erm...
 Doju: anybody else having issues with pac info?
 Doju: i don't think i changed a thing and my bot is broken
 Doju: could still very well just be me though
 cegprakash: #3 in gold time to stare the leaderboard more
 cegprakash: 97%
 Chkoupinator: can pacmen see in diagonal? 
 [Csongor]: Does it matter witch language you choose to write your code in? I chose js for this pac-man competition, but I see that all the top ones use C++.
 Astrobytes: You can do it cegprakash!
 cegprakash: I couldn't I'll park my bot for sometime
 cegprakash: hoping ppl will push me
 cegprakash: I didn't get enough games against boss
 Opeyevil: how would you import a class or .h file into this website?
 eulerscheZahl: you write everything in a single file
 Astrobytes: You can code everything offline in multiple files then use a script to merge into one file for CG of course
 EvModder: watching games where players don't activate speed until the 2nd turn, and I didn't understand why....until i played one and they ate my packed because their speed lasted 1 turn longer
 EvModder: ate my pac*
 EvModder: it's some next-level thinking to be sure
 cegprakash: it's a bug EvModder
 cegprakash: it's same as using speed on first turn
 EvModder: oh?
 cegprakash: if u see someone doing that help them by sending them the replay that they have a bug
 MSmits:&#160;??
 EvModder: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: i disagree ceg
 Icebox: lol
 MSmits: what is this bug you're talking about ceg?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't speed in turn 1, if i spawn next to an opponent that could eat me
 MSmits: are you smoking your pellets?
 Icebox: nice try to hide a strat ceg
 cegprakash: well that's a rare case
 cegprakash: 1 in 1000 times it can happen
 EvModder: i agree eulerscheZahl; always save ability if a scary opponent is next to you
 eulerscheZahl: also saw another player optimize for super pellets: no need to speed, when the first is 1 cell away
 MSmits: a little bit more often than that cegprakash
 EvModder: unless they have speed
 GauravGosain: hello guys im new here
 EvModder: welcome&#160;:)
 GauravGosain: thanks a lot :D 
 Adnmaster: how many lines of code did you write to get out of bronze?
 eulerscheZahl: hello new i'm here for longer already
 EvModder: i have programmed strats for a lot lot lot of edge cases / rare maps
 MSmits: I'm newer than here for longer already
 eulerscheZahl: let me check...silver opened wednesday evening
 EvModder: but my general pellet collection is kind of mediocre
 MSmits: many doubles I take it?
 eulerscheZahl: my bot which promoted to silver had 1250 lines
 GauravGosain: just got a problem with a solution of x * (x+y) and my fellow clashers are struggling 
 Adnmaster: omg
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, that was goldlooked at the wrong day
 Adnmaster: whew
 EvModder: lots of lines man
 eulerscheZahl: 1014
 Adnmaster: nooooooooooooooooo
 cegprakash: good job kord lets bring down this boss's score
 eulerscheZahl: then again: i promoted by being top10 when the league opened
 GauravGosain: lvl52 @eulerscheZahl wow
 EvModder: mine is like 1000 but it has a lot of stuff in commented out blocks
 Adnmaster: what strategy did you use? (dont tell if its forbidden to tell) eulerscheZahl
 EvModder: (cool features i tried to implement but made my rating drop when i tried them out lol)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to go too much into detail. but i'm planning a few turns ahead and tracking my opponent location
 Adnmaster: so you are going to chase him?
 MSmits: only if he cant escape
 EvModder: i chase enemies, if i know i can catch them&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: GauravGosain you saw my rank by hovering over my avatar i suppose. there's also a text "don't invite me to clash of code"
 GauravGosain: oh im sorry
 King-Of-Code: My gameboard doesnt show up?
 Icebox: xd
 King-Of-Code: new here
 Astrobytes: Is this the first competition where you haven't "gone into too much detail" eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: yes i chase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464470922">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464470922</a>
 Icebox: eternal struggle euler :D
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl he just saw clash of code. If you look at the text, both sides of that sentence are a in a different color background
 Icebox: why isn't there an option to disable invites :D
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i'm usually too talky Astrobytes&#160;:/
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: he said plenty
 MSmits: my bot is Euler's idea
 eulerscheZahl: stop trolling
 njaber: Anybody knows if we can get perf improvement from parallel computing, or do they prevent threading entierly?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Adnmaster: lol :D
 AntiSquid: lol 
 AntiSquid: (didn't read chat yet)
 EvModder:  eulerschezahl that replace is quite cool
 EvModder: replay*
 EvModder: i still haven't got my pacs to collaborate with eachother to trap enemies
 MSmits: me neither
 MSmits: you can get legend without such things
 MSmits: but it's cool
 EvModder: ya
 EvModder: it is cool to watch
 Hjax: its so hard to understand why my bot wins and loses 
 EvModder: tell me about it
 MSmits: I can usually tell... it's just hard to find a generic fix fo rit
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you don't see what your bot is seeing
 perseverent: I still can't believe the silver strength
 Astrobytes: Hjax - it wins when you beat the opponent, it loses when the inverse is true! (sorry)
 perseverent: what the hack
 njaber: I think there's a better way to get the answer to my question, do people in Legend usually use parallel computing?
 MSmits: noone does
 perseverent: what do one have to do against that boss
 MSmits: one core
 Hjax: like, i write a feature, it makes my bot worse, dont really know why 
 Hjax: guess i try to write a different feature 
 EvModder: threads are nasty  anyways
 njaber: Ok then I guess I need to find another way to optimize my thing
 EvModder: who wants that
 Doju: Hjax oh yep
 MSmits: happens to me as well Hjax. It's discouraging
 eulerscheZahl: been there too Hjax
 MSmits: havent gotten a solid improvement since monday
 eulerscheZahl: but right now i know what i broke
 Doju: i just spent the day writing things that make my pacs not crash
 Doju: rank dropped by 200
 Hjax: but your monday bot is better than my friday bot MSmits
 Hjax: :D
 MSmits: I know... that's the silver lining
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/6I1Hfvl">https://imgur.com/a/6I1Hfvl</a>some pellets have a probability &gt; 1 to exist&#160;:/
 MSmits: then the gold lining
 MSmits: and now legend&#160;:)&#160;:)
 MSmits: but good to see you got your search working at least Hjax
 Hjax: yeah it works, i think its just optimizing for terrible things 
 Doju: eulerscheZahl great then you only need to send 0,76 pacs there
 EvModder: hmm, that pellet looks very likely to exist
 cegprakash: makes sense Doju
 EvModder: also, nice image
 wlesavo: more than likely
 MSmits: thats annoying Hjax, your type of search is hard to debug also
 EvModder: i use cerr in the IDE to debug my grid lol
 njaber: Ok frick I think I need to switch to c++, I'll have to rewrite everything&#160;:(
 EvModder: why?
 njaber: Not enough perf for what I want to do
 Astrobytes: You need to use the D
 EvModder: ah, that's unfortunate
 njaber: I need some precalcs in in turn 1 bue they take 4 times too long with c#
 <b>**AntiSquid watches the pendulum swing rank up and down</b></p><p><img src="/a/44367721008170" /> EvModder: i wrote in c++ because of familiarity, but my code should be fine in python or anything really
 njaber: I'm not even sure c++ will give me enough perf
 EvModder: best of luck antisquid, don't get too wrapped up watching it lol
 pmor: write in machine code
 njaber: Actually it's probably more the 4 times too long since I haven't implemented all of the logic yet
 AntiSquid: it's hypnotizing EvModder
 zarif98sjs: @eulerscheZahl how are you generating this image
 Astrobytes: He takes all his output data and manually draws each fram in GIMP
 Astrobytes: *frame
 eulerscheZahl: directly in my bot code, with pragma not to do it on submit
 eulerscheZahl: that's just 30 lines of code to generate them
 cegprakash: I am waiting for eulerscheZahl's gif after the contest already
 eulerscheZahl: not that interesting. you see some tracking and path clearing
 [Csongor]: What is the new thing in gold?
 cegprakash: thinking about entering legend without having an opponent tracking I must be too greedy
 eulerscheZahl: silver rules are final
 [Csongor]: really
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: was planned that bronze rules are final. but the missing dead players were a "fix" during the contest
 cegprakash: even if I'm #2 and there is a big gap from the boss in score I'll get very less matches against the boss?
 eulerscheZahl: i think only codingame can answer that
 EvModder: i dont know, i had to resubmit my bot for it to be matched against the boss
 cegprakash: omg Zylo what did u add
 cegprakash: u just promoted few ppl
 Zylo: yee... I'm stronger than boss and weaker than a few others&#160;:-/
 Kukiss: I see you are almost 1 point ahead now&#160;:)
 Doju: I seriously need to add some kind of combat logic but i have no idea where to put it or how to even do it&#160;:/
 Doju: currently my pacs only focus on pellets and not screwing the pathing up
 llllllllll: thats perfectly fine imo
 llllllllll: combat wastes time
 Doju: No but they like run straight into enemies
 llllllllll: ah ok, thats bad
 Doju: if there's a pellet in between them and the enemy
 Doju: and don't even consider killing them even if it's possible in one move
 zarif98sjs: I still have no idea how to track the enemy 
 zarif98sjs: looks like without adding that my bot is not improving
 HiIamFriend: did anyone tried to trap enemy packmans if u have more score&#160;?
 MarekM: yes, collision resolving is essential, but i have still problem when attacked by the corner, no chance to see him
 HiIamFriend: to prevent enemy to gain more score
 romanshevchuk: can someone please explain how this rule works?
 VicHofs: No
 VicHofs: SPEED grants an extra move round for those who have it on
 VicHofs: all other pacs who don't can't move
 romanshevchuk: I though it's an ability that I can enable from time to time. I don't see anything in the rules about stopping other pacs from moving
 VicHofs: It is though
 VicHofs: But that's how it works
 VicHofs: if any of the pacs has speed on, there will be intermittent rounds when only pacs with speed enabled can move
 Valiant_Wolf: to rephrase: each round has two movement phases; only pacs with the speed ability enabled can move in the second phase
 Kellthazar: Wow... I think that Ill be promoted
 VicHofs: sick @Kellthazar
 Kellthazar: Thanks... And the @ is not necessary to mention an user VicHofs&#160;;)
 VicHofs: I am well aware Kellthazar&#160;;)&#160;;)
 HiIamFriend: how to know if you will get blocked or no
 HiIamFriend: you always has to check around pacs for that&#160;?
 VicHofs: wym
 HiIamFriend: have*
 romanshevchuk: @VicHofs, @Valiant_Wolf, thanks a lot for explanation, I can see now how it maps to what I see in game summary
 VicHofs: what league are you in? @HiIamFriend
 EvModder: you dont always know you will be blocked until it happens
 HiIamFriend: wood 1
 VicHofs: I would say not to worry about that just yet
 HiIamFriend: coliding into each over
 HiIamFriend: and get stuck
 EvModder: you can keep track of your position last turn, and if you are in the same spot next turn you can deduce you were blocked
 HiIamFriend: ow
 EvModder: and try doing a different move next turn if you want
 VicHofs: try to improve your pellet algo first HilamFriend
 Kellthazar: HilamFriend, I check if the bot is stucked by comparing the current and last position
 HiIamFriend: i am stupid wow
 HiIamFriend: ... :D
 VicHofs: nah famm
 HiIamFriend: ty 
 VicHofs: focusing on my pellet algo is what got me into bronze tho
 HiIamFriend: from zero to hero
 HiIamFriend: lets go
 HiIamFriend: :D
 VicHofs: I didn't even have a collision avoidance system just yet
 VicHofs: np
 EvModder: is it possible to go down a league if i do badly enough?&#160;:)
 VicHofs: no
 HiIamFriend: rank 39/669 but randomly i get stuck by no solving coliding 
 HiIamFriend: so i cant get promoted
 HiIamFriend: :D
 Doju: Ok i give myself an hour to make some super basic combat logic and then imma go to bed
 VicHofs: huh
 VicHofs: @HilamFriend well if you feel like your pellet algo's good enough already then go right ahead
 Kellthazar: If is the case, I try to find another floor to go which not include the "stuck Point" on the path.
 HiIamFriend: will try
 Kellthazar: Gold League&#160;:)
 HiIamFriend: cool
 VicHofs: damn bro how lmao
 muy31: come on... almost there...
 kovi: nice robo
 RoboStac: and now I fall back down again&#160;:)
 Akarachudra: but dat was impressive
 kovi: hungarian pattern
 kovi: not any more
 kovi: 5 hungarian now
 RoboStac: ah, do I need to move to hungary to be able to stay at the top?
 Astrobytes: lol, told ya it was a Hungarian takeover! Gratulálunk!
 llllllllll: elég király&#160;:^)
 kovi: van meg hely&#160;:)
 VicHofs: yes
 cegprakash: mataranga leading boss by 2 points
 cegprakash: u just rekt him like a piece of cake
 Astrobytes: Other than egészségedre that's about the extent of my Hungarian language skills. Though I used to know the words to Hang és fény by  Kispál és a Borz, and Csillag vagy fecske, and Most múlik pontosan by Csík Zenekar (and Quimby)
 Doju: Szia, Doju vagyok
 Doju: that's about all i know
 Astrobytes: btw cegprakash, thanks for your music playlist :smile:
 Doju: apart from the obvious swearwords :D
 cegprakash: wow somebody listens to my playlist
 cegprakash: :D
 VicHofs: music playlist?
 Astrobytes: I only did about half, but some OK stuff on there
 VicHofs: why on Earth do yall know Hungarian
 HiIamFriend: this pacman movement makes no sense to me :D
 Doju: VicHofs i have a hungarian friend
 VicHofs: oh I see Doju
 cegprakash: Indian songs playlist VicHofs
 Astrobytes: I like music from all countries, and my Hungarian friend took me to see Kispál és a Borz, Csík Zenekar, Quimby and Kiss Tibor
 cegprakash: wait kord got pushed up too :O 
 Astrobytes: And I love Indian melodies and rhythms
 cegprakash: 4 legends on the way
 kovi: vadasz may end up top legend
 NinjaDoggy: already 50 legends day 1 :O
 NinjaDoggy: wait... vadasz's submit might end #1 legend
 NinjaDoggy: how much was he above gold boss ._.
 Peudoki: Hungarians dominate
 Vadasz: Its funny, i  hardly beated the gold boss with the same bot. Quite large random factor.
 HiIamFriend: how to get pacman current possition
 Doju: HilamFriend it's given in the input
 NinjaDoggy: "i  hardly beated the gold boss"
 NinjaDoggy: whelp
 Astrobytes: if 'mine' is == 1 or true it's your pacman and you can use the x and y HiIamFriend
 HiIamFriend: inputs[0] and inputs[1] gives the possition he is moving to , the end of the road :D
 Vadasz: I was better with only 1 score from the gold boss
 SurajMishra2209: 22 hours spent 
 HiIamFriend: my frontender skills does not help me in any way :DDD
 SurajMishra2209: and I still haven't finished bronze
 HiIamFriend: i feel like a stupid potato
 King-Of-Code: out of wood after 30 minutes now the fun begins
 King-Of-Code: gonna have to upgrade the manhattan distance alg
 kovi: still very nice submit vadasz
 kovi: legend may have enough players now to catapult submit. and with 50% rate can stay in top
 HiIamFriend: can someone explain this "MOVE ${x} ${parseInt(inputs[0])} ${parseInt(inputs[1])}" how can he move to left and right with this :DD i am playing around btw
 HiIamFriend: does move mean "go 3 forward and like 1 right"
 NapTown: it's a destination
 Kellthazar: No
 HiIamFriend: so its a destination like on a map&#160;?
 HiIamFriend: he tries to move there&#160;?
 NapTown: yeah
 HiIamFriend: ow
 HiIamFriend: gotcha
 Kellthazar: x,y = coordinates
 HiIamFriend: i understand that
 Kellthazar: each coordinate has a "optimal" path  to others coordinates
 Doju: No they dont
 Doju: but they do have the shortest
 Doju: optimal depends on what you value
 muy31: someone kill me now, im back at 17th place
 Kellthazar: yeah, Doju is right!
 Doju: okay muy31 i'm currently making killing logic
 muy31: thank you
 Doju: i'll let you know when i'm done
 Doju: i'm trying to figure out how long travelling a distance will take but can't figure it out with my tired brain&#160;:/
 Doju: like that's off-by-one-error land right there
 muy31: once i get to gold im going to use trapping logic
 muy31: and re-implement my enemy tracking which ive disabled for now
 muy31: i really dont want to resubmit again, but ive been stuck here for 3 days now... what should i do?
 muy31: if i win the next three matches against clyde, im resubmitting
 HiIamFriend: :DDD cool
 elderlybeginner: how to turn off editor's hints and suggestions?
 muy31: What I find funny? I get 3/4 superpellets and still lose, AGAINST MYSELF! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464866992">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464866992</a>
 muy31: at this point im just randomly testing different conditions to see how they work in a scenario
 muy31: Same scenario, different condition, same outcome... but interesting shape on frame 75/76https://www.codingame.com/replay/464870525
 VicHofs: yeah I love minecraft
 VicHofs: diamond pickaxe looks dope
 HiIamFriend: muy31 why keep bumping into each other&#160;? 
 Scarfield: its the best way to make minecraft recipe pics :p
 muy31: HilamFriend all of them trying to take shortest path to nearest unexplored location
 muy31: but actually there are not bumping, only two are
 muy31: b/c i disabled killing
 Doju: oh, this was surprisingly easy
 Doju: tbh it took me an hour to write like 30 lines but anyways
 muy31: oh im rank 2 hallelujah!
 VicHofs: damn nice
 NapTown: it do be like that Doju
 VicHofs: every day Doju
 muy31: nvm rank 3 now
 muy31: how you like that, second place says

 Doju: Error counter: 8
 Clagus: what?
 Doju: that's surprisingly good for an hour's worth of code
 Doju: oop, 9
 Clagus: what error counter?
 Doju: counting errors in my code :P
 Scarfield: not fixing them?&#160;:)
 muy31: lol
 Doju: Scarfield maybe
 Scarfield: nice, but just joking&#160;:)
 Doju: 10
 Clagus: this is crazy I've got 71% win ratio and still not promotion 
 SurajMishra2209: my name doesn't appear in cgstats
 SurajMishra2209: can somebody help me out on that?
 VicHofs: You gotta be top 1000
 VicHofs: I think
 SurajMishra2209: the last rank I got was in 200
 VicHofs: overall
 muy31: total
 VicHofs: not in your league
 SurajMishra2209: okay
 SurajMishra2209: got it
 muy31: you are 1699
 Doju: lets see if this modification did anything
 VicHofs: 69 lmao
 SurajMishra2209: lol
 muy31: 1710 now
 muy31: 1988
 muy31: 1698
 muy31: my bad
 SurajMishra2209: yeah another version of code
 SurajMishra2209: :D
 muy31: 1645
 muy31: ranks up
 muy31: nice job
 SurajMishra2209: thanks
 SurajMishra2209: still not good enough
 NapTown: my flee enemy code makes me stand still while they consume me:expressionless:
 NinjaDoggy: better than runing into them :p
 VicHofs: looooove falling 1000 ranks when I submit 😒
 VicHofs: scratch that
 VicHofs: make it 1500
 NapTown: slightly NinjaDoggy
 Doju: oh yes i think it definitely did something
 Doju: winning like 80%
 muy31: you submitted it yet doju?
 Doju: yup, computing
 muy31: Killing achieved... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464891163">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464891163</a>
 RockyMullet: 44th at 13% :eyes:
 RockyMullet: my change seems to help
 RockyMullet: theres hope
 NapTown: nice
 MattSOrme: most of the game is pretty standard, couple bugs im still working on. But look at how it ends<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464889801">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464889801</a>
 RockyMullet: dont know if its enough to beat gold boss, but definitly an improvement
 Doju: muy31 it's not actively trying to kill
 Doju: you just happened to be in the way :P
 muy31: oh
 RockyMullet: the munching
 NapTown: monch monch
 muy31: i stopped trying to kill though
 muy31: rank 5
 muy31: im never going to progress
 MattSOrme: my bots aren't killers, so getting a win by a double kill is pretty cool
 AntiSquid: RockyMullet imo too random leaderboard to tell 
 cegprakash: does anyone else get random timeouts?
 cegprakash: it started only today for me
 MarekM: no
 AntiSquid: either you have a MASSIVE improvement and notice the difference or you get fooled by the randomness
 MarekM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/464892869">https://www.codingame.com/replay/464892869</a> close enough
 cegprakash: exactly AntiSquid
 Doju: AntiSquid that's very true
 cegprakash: I was #3 above kovi
 cegprakash: I should have parked my bot there
 cegprakash: now kovi reached legend
 cegprakash: and I'm stuck at #200
 RockyMullet: oh well AntiSquid I feel, deep down, in my hearth, that its an improvement :P
 AntiSquid: ya cegprakash very very bad mistakes you made there
 King-Of-Code: the fact i can land on a pac and they can change type before my eat registers is quite annoying
 muy31: RIP cegprakash
 AntiSquid: you might have missed legend because of that cegprakash
 muy31: that's porb for the best King-Of-Code
 muy31: *prob
 AntiSquid: cegprakash are you resubmitting your initial rank 3 bot&#160;? 
 Doju: oh this was a definite improvement
 cegprakash: yes with bugfixes
 AntiSquid: no, submit without the bugfixes
 cegprakash: infact this is my 2 day old code
 Doju: 150 ranks up muy31
 cegprakash: whatever I did in the middle I threw out
 muy31: sweet Doju
 AntiSquid: sometimes "bugfixes" drop your rank, it's really stupid leaderboard system
 AntiSquid: just get the exact saem code and resub
 cegprakash: I'll have to do it 100 times luckier because those who gave me points got promoted now
 cegprakash: I had 1 chance
 AntiSquid: at the very least submit the rank3 code and leave it overnight, you never know
 AntiSquid: ya sux to miss legend like that
 cegprakash: AntiSquid do u have the time when I was #3? I lost that version
 cegprakash: chat got disconnected in the middle
 cegprakash: and all messages erased
 AntiSquid: uhm try 3 hours ago&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: everyone in gold before you submit make you have &gt;50% winrate against boss please&#160;:)
 cegprakash: found it
 cegprakash: saving backup
 NinjaDoggy: i would like to get to legend without having to be rank 1&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: ninja i beat boss once on my current sub, don't want any complaints @_@
 HiIamFriend: my mind is melting
 muy31: i just got inspiration, what if I...
 muy31: nope
 Doju: I think the fancy pathfinding thing i wrote today goes out the window if the pacs are "panicked"
 Doju: oh well
 Doju: imma go, cya everybody
 muy31: lol
 muy31: gn
 AntiSquid: ceg i think you fked up big time, looks like you would have been promoted by now
 HiIamFriend: how come my pacmans moves and stops moves and stops
 Gonny: ceg don't give up though, there's probably gonna be another 50 promotions before then end of the contest
 Kellthazar: 2 situations: your pacs arent over speed buff and there is another pac with this buff active...
 Kellthazar: HilamFriend
 HiIamFriend: wood
 HiIamFriend: does not use speed buff&#160;?
 Colios13: yep no speed in wood
 Kellthazar: There is speed on "Wood" league?
 Kellthazar: oh right
 muy31: no
 Kellthazar: nvm then
 HiIamFriend: i am trying to save old possitions of pacman if he gets stuck
 HiIamFriend: but somehow array is not update'ing  fast enouth i guess
 HiIamFriend: and every second move he bugs out
 HiIamFriend: somehow
 HiIamFriend: because array is not updated
 HiIamFriend: and brings same numbers of x and y
 HiIamFriend: my mind is melting
 HiIamFriend: xd
 MarekM: HIlamFriend, this is because activated speed
 HiIamFriend: wood league doest not have speed
 muy31: am i actually ever going to pass up silver bot?
 Kellthazar: Maybe your array isn't updated because you create a new one on each loop iteration
 HiIamFriend: nope
 HiIamFriend: its global 
 HiIamFriend: before while loop
 Colios13: GL muy
 Kellthazar: In my algorithm I have a pacman object that has a history property
 Kellthazar: Which is a list
 Kellthazar: and I add the currentPos of the pacman on each iteration
 HiIamFriend: const tempPacsPossitions = [];
 HiIamFriend: i replace
 HiIamFriend: last
 HiIamFriend: but same i think
 Kellthazar: Why not just add?
 HiIamFriend: why not just replace old one with a new one&#160;?
 HiIamFriend: :D
 Kellthazar: and get the last one for stuck verification?
 Kellthazar: I use this history array to weight my paths
 HiIamFriend: how will i able to track every pacman that way
 Kellthazar: Object orientation?

 HiIamFriend: lovely 
 muy31: impressive PiterYeh
 HiIamFriend: spirit animal "Stop and give up" :D

 moojek: lmao
 NinjaDoggy: yes... bosses are just bots like yours or mine
 moojek: still
 NinjaDoggy: they literally select one from the ladder so...
 muy31: yah but that proves its not just doing a lazy eval to win
 muy31: its doing some hard computations
 Kukiss: I think it might be cause by any error. In replays you always see "Time out"  even if the user get normal error
 muy31: maybe?
 Kukiss: do sth stupid in code and see that probably you will have a Timed Out tag at  the end of the time line
 Kukiss: your code crashes to the output is not provided in time - that even makes sense
 Kukiss: so the output is not provided*
 butcer0: How do teams collaborate for competition in CodinGame? Is there any way of constructing a more formal team or is a single user supposed to represent a team?
 muy31: at least three members of your company has to submit code
 muy31: or school

 Kukiss: I messed sth up 
 muy31: yeah that doesnt look good at all
 Drastic_Loontastic: How do you change the speed?
 baDcoder: Hello, do player downgrade to any lower league&#160;?
 Drastic_Loontastic: Or edit the speed, I'm confused
 Flyingkid: no your safe bad coder! you only move up in leagues.
 Flyingkid: :grimacing:
 Kukiss: Drastic you can use two "special" actions: SPEED and SWITCH  once you get to Bronze
 baDcoder: Thanks Flying Kid , sigh&#160;!&#160;:)
 butcer0: What is the definition of a "Company" for competition?
 Flyingkid: good thing too cause you think everything is good then submit and then nothing but timeouts some times.
 Drastic_Loontastic: Thank you so much Kukiss, I couldn't find where it said that
 Kukiss: np. there are more details about this topic like cooldowns etc.
 Drastic_Loontastic: Oh silly me, I didn't read it XD

 muy31: im in a dilemma: the anti-Clyde code beats Clyde 80% of the time, but cant beat everyone else, the everyone else code beats everyone else but cant beat Clyde
 NormantasStankevicius: I know the feels muy, last challange I could beat everyone in silver besides the boss... tbh I would focus on beating everyone, more score
 NormantasStankevicius: but that is me and I don't know this system well
 cegprakash: I'm starting to wonder
 cegprakash: may the bug was a feature
 cegprakash: it it's own weird way
 HiIamFriend: and i am just trying to move to random locations :DD

 VicHofs: You're fucked Kayzerg
 HiIamFriend: go to private chat

 thethiny: guys when did the competition start
 seronis: bit over a week ago i think
 thethiny: yes I want the date if anyone knows it
 Cappefra: it was thursday last week
 thethiny: thanks 
 HiIamFriend: why cant i beat wood 1 :D
 HiIamFriend: i never get stuck
 HiIamFriend: still cant get promoted
 HiIamFriend: so sad
 ZarthaxX: never get stuck?
 HiIamFriend: yea
 ZarthaxX: wdym
 HiIamFriend: probably because i move to random location until i get stuck
 HiIamFriend: dunno
 ZarthaxX: ok..
 HiIamFriend: can you check if cordinate is a wall or no&#160;?
 seronis: if you saved that info at the top of the script, then yes
 seronis: i build a board object with all the cell contents before the while() loop starts
 thethiny: are we allowed to do multithreading here? and if we are, will it benefit?
 seronis: i doubt it
 thethiny: if it's a single core then multithreading won't matter
 HiIamFriend: i mean where is "readline()"
 thethiny: @HiIamFriend what's your question
 HiIamFriend: but can you somehow get like "readline(x, y)"&#160;?
 thethiny: c++?
 HiIamFriend: like if (x,y) is a wall 
 HiIamFriend: js
 seronis: readline is a user input.  it has nothing to do with xy
 thethiny: exactly
 thethiny: what u do is
 thethiny: let var something something = let var = readline();
 thethiny: then var[x] == -1
 thethiny: or '#'
 HiIamFriend: hmm
 HiIamFriend: will try 
 seronis: make your own object to track the board
 seronis: i do  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/SkF8ClD.png">https://i.imgur.com/SkF8ClD.png</a>
 seronis: so for any given cell i can always check if its been visited,  if its a wall/open,  what its last known pellet value was
 HiIamFriend: okey thanks&#160;!&#160;:)

 seronis: is it a string or an array / object&#160;?

 HiIamFriend: first print does print the character
 HiIamFriend: and in for loop i get that error
 HiIamFriend: why tf :D
 HiIamFriend: ow
 HiIamFriend: i use array in a very bad way
 HiIamFriend: sorry
 seronis: yeah you're using map wrong,  but i read it a few times and cant see a reason  'console.error(mapString.substring(0, 1));' wouldnt work
 DollarAkshay: Found a nice seed with a lot of action in the middle
 DollarAkshay: seed=2904725058612385800
 HiIamFriend: that one works
 HiIamFriend: console.error(map[i][y]);
 HiIamFriend: map[i][y].push(mapString.substring(char, char+1))&#160;;
 HiIamFriend: this one is not working :D
 HiIamFriend: its ok i will fix it

 BenjaminUrquhart: well yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: but actually 
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 DollarAkshay: :joy:
 DollarAkshay: *feeling lucky*
 thethiny: @BenjaminUruqhart yeah if the competition is over I don't wanna lose track of some people
 bouajajais: do the rules change in silver and more?
 DollarAkshay: nope
 bouajajais: so it's only ranking afterwards
 bouajajais: thanks
 Icebox: yes it does
 bouajajais: oh
 thethiny: silver has Dead
 Icebox: starting from silver you can see dead pacs
 thethiny: Gold has more Dead
 DollarAkshay: Its not really a new rule
 bouajajais: what are deads?
 BenjaminUrquhart: deads
 DollarAkshay: Its some dummy info
 bouajajais: oh ghosts
 DollarAkshay: Thye give the info of dead pacs
 bouajajais: okay
 DollarAkshay: During turn input
 DollarAkshay: But everything else is the same
 bouajajais: thanks good luck
 DollarAkshay: No changes
 HiIamFriend: i cant beat wood 1 by moving randomly 
 HiIamFriend: :D
 Icebox: DollarAkshay dummy info that allows a brand new substrategy and completely breaks your code if you don't adapt for new inputs
 HiIamFriend: i had hopes
 Icebox: "no changes"
 DollarAkshay: @Icebox Nice banner Image 
 DollarAkshay: Where did you find it
 Icebox: I'd be amused if you hadn't asked me this in 2018 and then in 2019
 Icebox: you can put the checkmark down for 2020 as well now
 Alp3r: sa ipneler
 DollarAkshay: I made that banner btw
 Icebox: yes you told me that multiple times already :D
 thethiny: lol
 DollarAkshay: XD
 DollarAkshay: Sorry have forgotten
 thethiny: that moment when your code runs offline, but returns -1 in the multiplayer&#160;:)
 DollarAkshay: -1&#160;? XD
 thethiny: yes -1 means not found
 DollarAkshay: What in the world is printign that -1
 DollarAkshay: Oh
 thethiny: trying to find the best path
 thethiny: my adjacency list is wrong
 thethiny: damn
 thethiny: found the culprit lol
 thethiny: woohooo
 thethiny: 106 - 51 vs Inky
 DollarAkshay: Nice
 DollarAkshay: You might even skipp silver
 thethiny: I don't have collision avoidance
 thethiny: and I don't have attack modes
 thethiny: so not yet
 thethiny: leftover debug code hurts
 thethiny: "if bla bla bla || True"
 DollarAkshay: I alwasy add a comment called DEV_CODE
 DollarAkshay: So that i know if there is any code that should not be submitted
 DollarAkshay: I just do a Ctrl+F and find that comment
 BiriyaniCrypt02: Love This Website
 thethiny: 😂😂
 EvModder: i used a lot of cheap tricks to get to my current spot on the leaderboard.Like standing still and then turning into the thing that eats them when the move to eat me etc
 EvModder: i will need to rewrite most of my code to actually be able to challenge any top players

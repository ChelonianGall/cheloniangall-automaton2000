 Surina_Quinn: does anyone have advice for a beginner? I'm trying my best to learn but it all just gets jumbled in my head and it makes me feel...low
 Goulstem: @Surina_Quinn I suggest you pick a project that interests you! This is the best way to learn, by far. Then you have an application for all your knowledge. Also, key: the more something pulls you (inspires you/motivates you), the less you have to push yourself! :D
 Passifi: Salut 
 jacek: ohai
 Passifi: woo codin game runs badly on the rasberri pi Im having crysis flashbacks here :P
 jacek: robo :eyes:
 MSmits: what'd he do now?
 jacek: othello. but were safe
 MSmits: ah
 DaniloKrkeljic: hey, idk if this is the place to ask, but im getting correct results in the defibrillator game on everything but "Complete File", is this a bug&#160;?
 jacek: with your program :o
 DaniloKrkeljic: im gettting correct results on "Complete file 2" though
 MSmits: the reason you have different testcases is to test different parts of your program. It is completely natural to fail one and succeed the other
 MSmits: find out how the testcases are different
 MSmits: use debug statements to split up your program and see what it's doing
 DaniloKrkeljic: Ok, ty very much, appreciate it. Ill look into it.
 MSmits: np, good luck
 Westicles: wow, such a highly literate contrib approved.  things are looking up
 gatitos: is it me or does the site UI keep changing
 gatitos: sometimes "complete" is under "Activities"
 gatitos: sometimes it isnt
 jacek: theyre changing header and some people get it, some not
 Andrew97: has anyone finished last weeks challenge? Battle Tower
 Angecide: Hi Jacek when doing 1ply check to add bias toward moves that win miniboard/block enemy win, do u also take into consideration if the move would give enemy a win on the next board?
 Angecide: or technically speaking, that would be a 2ply check
 Angecide: so I guess not
 jacek: no, too costly for meh
 jacek: but i penalty moves that would end up on finished boards, giving enemy mobility
 Angecide: ah yeah that's a fairly lightweight check so that could work too
 jacek: with that 2-ply check, actually with some generated tables that could be cheap
 _Time_Lord_: bus
 Angecide: yea but the 2ply check can get complicated because you can't keep avoiding capturing a board in favor of not giving enemy one, so at some point u need to kind of evaluate when the tradeoff is in your favor, I guess one easy tradeoff that is in ur favor is getting the middle miniboard in favor of any of the side ones
 MSmits: the problem with uttt is that there are exceptions to every rule Angecide
 MSmits: middle is not always better than other boards
 MSmits: what jacek means is that he gives a penalty in selecting a move that gives the opponent this freedom, but he does still select the move
 MSmits: it simple has a penalty in UCT
 MSmits: simply
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: alternatively, in the random rollout, you can try to disallow them altogether, under some circumstances
 MSmits: just dont be too strict about refusing these moves, because sometimes, especially in the late game, you have no choice
 MSmits: or only poor alternatives
 jacek: i do this only in uct
 Angecide: yea that's true, I guess the bias should just work as guidlines and not some authoritarian rule, and the uct will hopefully figure out if it is worth it or not
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: though there is no problem with an "authoritarian rule" as long as it  is limited properly
 MSmits: for example. you can disallow these moves in the first 20-25 plies or so and it will be fine
 MSmits: because even if there exists a finished board, it's probably never gonna be a good idea to give an opponent a free move
 Angecide: yea, like enforcing teccles heuristic
 MSmits: right, that heuristic is one of the most reliable ones
 MSmits: but it's not perfect
 MSmits: I have seen gamestates, especially ply 20+ where using it, hurts you
 MSmits: turning a solved win in a draw, or a solved draw into a loss
 MSmits: possibly using it up to ply 18 or so is 100% safe... but it is hard to say without solving the game
 jacek: yet
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 MSmits: just improved my code of the rings a bit with pruning, rank 20 now. Small steps. I need to figure out a way to do the loop stuff
 MSmits: so far still doing the loops manually
 jrke: whats the difference between b += 1&lt;&lt;3;and b |= 1&lt;&lt;3;
 RoboStac: it depends what b is before hand. If bit 3 is 0 then they're the same.
 RoboStac: if bit 3 is one the second one does nothing but the first still adds 8 
 jrke: oh
 jrke: btw whats the opposite of b|=1&lt;&lt;2;
 jrke: like i wanna make bit 2 turn 0 from 1
 RoboStac: b &amp;= ~(1&lt;&lt;2) 
 RoboStac: thats a tilde (bitwise not), not a minus sign btw 
 jrke: yeah its ~
 MSmits: alternatively, if you know for sure the bit is set you can do b ^= 1&lt;&lt; 2
 MSmits: but if you dont know and just want to make sure it is 0, you use Robos method, but thats 1 extra operation
 jrke: ok
 jrke: so it makes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 right 
 MSmits: thats what ^ does yes
 MSmits: ^1 actually
 RoboStac: it looks like its an extra operation in code but most cpu's have bit set / reset that the compiler can use
 MSmits: oh, did not know that
 jrke: so b ^= 1&lt;&lt;2; is perfect for othello i think
 MSmits: thats another thing jrke, everyone gets to a point where they start to look for little things that would make their code faster, but more often than not, the compiler will recognize and do it by itself. So that's mostly wasted effort
 MSmits: Robo just shared an example of that
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: but if you like ^=, that's fine
 MSmits: just be careful about it in case the bit was already 0
 MSmits: bugs in bit ops are really hard to notice
 jrke: thank you very much my net is slow so going gtg bye cya
 MSmits: cya jrke
 jacek: well it looks simpler
 MSmits: yeah... readability vs safe coding
 MSmits: &amp;= ~ is often safer than ^=
 MSmits: I prefer ^= because I've done this so often now , i dont often make the mistake of flipping a 0 bit
 MSmits: jrke was asking earlier about the problem with 1 &lt;&lt; 32 instead of 1ULL &lt;&lt; 32. That's an annoying bug that still happens to me
 MSmits: you dont notice it but it leads to bad crashes
 MSmits: probably i should just create a set bit function and stop typing it literally&#160;:)
 Angecide: noo msmits why did u remove the othello bot
 jacek: huh
 Angecide: or is it the same one as yesterday?
 Angecide: or maybe i am misunderstanding
 jacek: hes 5th
 Angecide: i read in yesterday log there were some new othello bot that was perfect or something, I wanted to check it out
 jacek: maybe the 1st one?
 Angecide: nah I think it was supposed to be better than recurse, I am not sure, maybe I misunderstood
 DaniloKrkeljic: There is a bug in the defibrillator game, "Complete file" answer is wrong. Are there similar bugs on this website?
 DaniloKrkeljic: i just dont wanna waste time if its possible the answer is wrong or similar 
 blasterpoard: DaniloKrkeljic plenty of people, me included, solved that puzzle without any problems
 blasterpoard: it is likely that the mistake is in your code, not in the puzzle
 DaniloKrkeljic: i found a forum question with people with the same problem
 DaniloKrkeljic: distance of calculated defib is smaller than the one form the answer, simple as that
 blasterpoard: Then how do you explain the 84% community success rate on that puzzle?
 DaniloKrkeljic: because when you submit you apparently get 100%
 blasterpoard: I have no problems passing that validator though
 blasterpoard: *test case
 DaniloKrkeljic: idk, these guys on the forum said the same thing.. well at least its good to know its not common apparently
 blasterpoard: maybe if you got 100% desptie that, the problem is that there are not enough validators, not that the test case is wrong
 VizGhar: well he obviously isn't using right formula&#160;:)
 DaniloKrkeljic: how come it works for "Complete file 2" then?
 VizGhar: I believe there were some rounding issues
 VizGhar: I also failed on one submission and had to fix it
 VizGhar: Problem #1 you might have is that formula has `x 6371` in itProblem #2 using floats instead of doubles (loosing precision)
 VizGhar: not sure where the problem was when I was solving it... but you should definitely not blame CG
 VizGhar: Potential problem #3 decimal separators
 DaniloKrkeljic: I'm using python float, so it shouldn't be a rounding problem. I'll look into it more i guess. Btw, the data from the website differs from test cases, maybe I'm supposed to build a solution according to that?
 VizGhar: you are supposed to come with general solution that matches any input it is given&#160;:)
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/defribillators-puzzle-discussion/37/177?u=vizghar">https://forum.codingame.com/t/defribillators-puzzle-discussion/37/177?u=vizghar</a>
 VizGhar: this guy had probably same problem as you and resolved it too
 VizGhar: "Ok, got it. Didn’t noticed that the user’s longitude and latitude include commas, too."
 VizGhar: do not fall into confirmation bias and look for solutions&#160;:)
 DaniloKrkeljic: No, i did that 1st thing. Anyway thx for trying to help, not gonna clog IRC beacuse of this
 DaniloKrkeljic: ill post a forum question i guess
 VizGhar: potential problem #4 radians/degrees
 VizGhar: yeah go ahead
 VizGhar: potential problem #5 too long computation
 VizGhar: but these are the question you can freely ask in IRC as well. Most of the time you just need slight push
 DaniloKrkeljic: Ok, ty very much Viz&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's here for a reason. If you have a valid question there are usually people willing to help out&#160;;)

 eulerscheZahl: now multiplayer 2048 suddenly seems possible
 eulerscheZahl: you shift on your own board and spawn for the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: i'm afk
 wlesavo: or you shift for both, you and your opponent while still having fixed number generator available eulerscheZahl
 Pouria2100: elo
 wlesavo: you may even shift for you and your opp always in the same direction i.e D D R R
 jacek: huh
 ErrorRazor: It's not multiplayer when one player plays for both
 jacek: thats what she said :disappointed:

 Saad-py: HI
 Saad-py: which language to learn after python
 Saad-py: for competetive programming
 JLukeSkywalker: for clash or bots?
 Char_2C: both?
 Saad-py: yeah
 JLukeSkywalker: for clash I would say ruby, for bot programming I would say c++
 Saad-py: both
 Saad-py: what do you mean by bot
 Saad-py: bot CODe (lol)
 JLukeSkywalker: multiplayer ai games like the othello or tron
 Saad-py: wtf 
 Saad-py: There are games for programming
 JLukeSkywalker: you have a turn time limit, so the languages that run faster let you do more calculations
 Saad-py: wtf
 Saad-py: I can't understand
 JLukeSkywalker: for clash, its about fast coding, so python is great, and for shortest code, ruby is really good
 JLukeSkywalker: what dont you understand?
 Saad-py: NOOOOO
 Saad-py: the bot part
 JLukeSkywalker: bot programming = there is a game, you write an AI to play the game
 Saad-py: ok give me an example
 JLukeSkywalker: are you trolling?
 DaniloKrkeljic: counter strike
 JLukeSkywalker: its like half of this website
 Saad-py: noo
 Saad-py: OH so you mean controlling games 
 Saad-py: like I make an AI to defuse the bomb
 JLukeSkywalker: tron, oware, coders strike back, othello, chess, checkers, ultimate tic tac toe, etc
 JLukeSkywalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 Saad-py: OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
 Saad-py: So in this websites we have to code for the game to work and run, YEAH I know them.
 Saad-py: lmao I am a bot
 Saad-py:&#160;??
 JLukeSkywalker: overall programming, if you already know python, its a great scripting language, I would say learn a compiled full OO language
 Saad-py: you mean OOP
 JLukeSkywalker: OO=object orientedOOP=object oriented programming
 JLukeSkywalker: same exact thing
 Saad-py: I think C++ is really good but then  I think of C#
 Saad-py: IDK which is better
 JLukeSkywalker: they are both better in different situations
 Saad-py: C# is for game devs, app devs
 JLukeSkywalker: I would say in general c++ is probably better to learn, and you could branch to C# after if you want to work with windows stuff
 Saad-py: I know a bit of .NET Winforms C#
 Saad-py: OK thx
 Saad-py: I will go with C++
 Saad-py: and btw how old are u
 Saad-py:&#160;??
 Saad-py:&#160;??
 JLukeSkywalker: 23, been programming for 12 years, and been teaching high school and college robotics for 6 years
 JLukeSkywalker: work as a control systems programmer full time
 DaniloKrkeljic: xDDD
 Saad-py: OOF
 Saad-py: I am -13 
 Saad-py: Know python very well
 Saad-py: worked with JS also
 Saad-py: suck at CSS
 Saad-py: Did winforms for a month or so
 Saad-py: less scripting
 Saad-py: I tried to speedran hackerrank python
 Saad-py: run*
 JLukeSkywalker: I learned python, c, java, basic, cobol, fortran and assembly by 15
 Saad-py: oof
 Saad-py: NOICE
 JLukeSkywalker: i kind of program instead of playing video games
 Saad-py: me too
 JLukeSkywalker: which is why this site is perfect, kind of both
 Saad-py: yeah ikr
 jacek: mhm
 Saad-py: @JLukeSkywalker
 Saad-py: Which language u best at
 JLukeSkywalker: c or assembly 
 JLukeSkywalker: i guess python and matlab second
 jacek: really? oO
 Saad-py: bruh
 JLukeSkywalker: i program hardware for a living
 Saad-py: You know so many languages
 Saad-py: Probably make a startup and go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR on the internet
 JLukeSkywalker: once you know how to program and think logically, you can learn a new language in like weeks, and master it in a year or 2
 Saad-py: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: except if the paradigm is completely different
 Saad-py: Imma try C++, my mind keeps changing
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. learning haskell when coming from C++/Java world
 Saad-py: I was doing ethical hacking for a month
 JLukeSkywalker: i hated learning haskell, you are right
 JLukeSkywalker: still logic though
 Saad-py: Hacked into my own laptop successfully, and exploited the hell out of it

 DaniloKrkeljic: yes that is amazon main server
 Astrobytes: hah!
 DaniloKrkeljic: bezos mainframe they call it
 reCurse: Interesting euler, but I wouldn't bother, that's the kind of thing they'll crack down upon very quick like it's a quest map
 reCurse: *bug
 eulerscheZahl: probably
 Astrobytes: (non-minor)
 eulerscheZahl: but if we use it to stay in the 30s but build a time bank?
 reCurse: I vaguely recall them being concerned about replay size or something
 reCurse: Though I did a pretty good job on that if I say so myself
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you tried to get around the SDK too?
 reCurse: Well I didn't use the GEM, so at least an order or two of magnitude smaller replays
 eulerscheZahl: ah, good job on replay size
 eulerscheZahl: SDK replays are huge as there is no domain knowledge
 reCurse: I understand why they did it
 reCurse: It's just newbie friendly at the cost of being very inefficient
 eulerscheZahl: compressing 2048 for 1h+ replay duration was fun :D
 reCurse: So CG in a nutshell
 reCurse: Sorry, bad mood today I think
 struct: replay size has more impact than the time the total game takes?
 eulerscheZahl: we still have the possibilities to code the UI in JS ourselves, so i'm fine with an inefficient SDK
 reCurse: There's all kinds of impacts
 reCurse: I just remember this being brought up for 10ms turns
 reCurse: Maybe there's other overheads I don't know about
 struct: I see, I remember the 1MB replays when atari go was in WIP
 reCurse: lol
 struct: he was drawing the board every frame
 eulerscheZahl: redrawing the whole game instead of updating single entities
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 reCurse: The cost you pay for making things too accessible
 eulerscheZahl: in my very first try i made the same mistake
 eulerscheZahl: but at that time there was no documentation, only UTTT
 eulerscheZahl: and pong
 reCurse: Reminds me of the game I wanted to make. Meh, oh well
 jacek: TIL the crazyhouse white has winrate about 85%

 reCurse: Welp glad I retired it then
 reCurse: Up to anyone's guess whether 960 would help or not
 jacek: on the other hand chess is dying from draws :c
 reCurse: Yeah that's one reason I got so interested in shogi
 reCurse: No draws
 reCurse: I wish there were as many game database available as for chess, would be possible to train a human player there
 jacek: why would you train human player
 reCurse: To learn the game better
 Angecide: wouldn't it be possible to infer strategy from non-humanlike ai?
 reCurse: I doubt it
 reCurse: You could go into a dangerous line with only one viable answer 10 plies long, but ends up winning for you
 reCurse: Trivial for AI to compute
 jacek: on CG, within 50ms...
 reCurse: How are you going to see that though
 reCurse: No forget CG
 NASIRUDDIN: hey
 jacek: that gave me an idea.. to generate piece square tables from my bt bot to see how they look like
 reCurse: The thing is, with training on human games and some biased search
 reCurse: You can get a very very interesting player
 reCurse: Worked for chess anyway

 jacek: really?
 jacek: like trying to mimic human?
 reCurse: Yeah
 Angecide: I see, it's about generating sensical moves/strategies rather than obscure ones
 NASIRUDDIN: hey guys
 reCurse: It's about training your inner eval
 NASIRUDDIN: :heart_eyes:
 reCurse: There is only so much tactics you can compute
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reCurse dies any boss in chess make draw offers?
 Angecide: yeah that makes sense
 NASIRUDDIN: hey
 PatrickMcGinnisII: does
 struct: Dont know if that site allows for an easy way to download matches though
 reCurse: It probably doesn't have enough
 reCurse: I'm talking hundreds of millions
 reCurse: Like lichess
 struct: ah, its only 550k games
 eulerscheZahl: good enough to for such a difference in winrate to be significant
 kovi: shogi was implemented already with mu0, want it?
 kovi: wasnt
 reCurse: Yeah but that's not what I'm talking about
 reCurse: Training a human player
 kovi: oh, i c
 Angecide: it almost sound like it could be possible to train an ai to be humanlike, i.e. prune moves that does; "go into a dangerous line with only one viable answer 10 plies long, but ends up winning for you"
 reCurse: It is
 reCurse: I've done it, sort of
 reCurse: I had plans but scrapped them when I realized how it would make cheating go out of control
 Angecide: cheating in which context, real life?
 reCurse: Online
 Angecide: oh I see, yea I could see that
 reCurse: PatrickMcGinnisII Sorry I missed your question, no they don't
 reCurse: Is there any point to bandas or is it fundamentally unbalanced?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx, deciding on what input to bother with

 reCurse: Accurate trolling is best
 VizGhar: hmm but I always count bits from 1
 reCurse: What's next, you're gonna tell me you start indexing at 1?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ~(x^4)
 JLukeSkywalker: matlab is the best language, indexes at 1
 reCurse: :fire:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops (x*4)==0
 JLukeSkywalker: dont maple and R also index at 1?
 eulerscheZahl: in pascal you can declare the first index likearray [50..100] of Integer;thus it's better than matlab?
 JLukeSkywalker: mathematicians are just annoying
 reCurse: Heresy comes in many forms
 eulerscheZahl: also i'm not a fan of proprietary languages in general and matlab in particular
 reCurse: So octave, whatever
 eulerscheZahl: except for simulink, i understand why that's popular
 JLukeSkywalker: i think matlab kind of deserves to be proprietary, it is pretty powerful, and most people that would use it can get it for free
 reCurse: If it keeps mathematicians nice and quiet and away from coding, all for it
 JLukeSkywalker: or have their company pay for it
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen better than matlab for freesagemath.org
 reCurse: Hmm I heard octave mentioned most shrug
 reCurse: Don't know how it compares
 eulerscheZahl: i know octave, same problems as matlab bet close in functionality
 reCurse: Just had to reverse engineer some matlab code once
 eulerscheZahl: sage is more like mathematica or maple
 reCurse: Wouldn't recommend
 JLukeSkywalker: octave is pretty much matlab without toolboxes
 JLukeSkywalker: and slightly different syntax
 eulerscheZahl: and with a slightly modified python parser
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. ^ is pow instead of xor
 reCurse: :fire:
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 Westicles: Isn't C# copyrighted property of microsoft?
 reCurse: No
 eulerscheZahl: MIT license
 JLukeSkywalker: they do pretty much control it, but it is free to use/develop
 reCurse: "control"
 eulerscheZahl: and sage can do exact math. solving equations, simplifying expressions, ..
 reCurse: They are the ones moving it forward rather
 eulerscheZahl: and it even has a rubik cube solver included
 JLukeSkywalker: if they dont like how you used c#, they will just release the next version that breaks your code
 reCurse: Umm
 JLukeSkywalker: no need to sue
 reCurse: They are extremely conscious about backward compatibility
 reCurse: Not sure what you refer to
 eulerscheZahl: i can't remember any of my C# code breaking
 JLukeSkywalker: I had a bunch of stuff break, but I think because it was super old
 eulerscheZahl: only on CG, someone missed to include System.Drawing.Common when switching to .net core&#160;:(
 JLukeSkywalker: think i jumped from 2.0 to 7. something
 JKSTUDIOS2020: wow
 eulerscheZahl: 2.0 was the first good C# version
 eulerscheZahl: added generics

 JLukeSkywalker: what is your degree in?
 Taseis: Computer Science 
 JLukeSkywalker: then imo you should probably be able to solve the easy problems, but most schools suck
 JLukeSkywalker: dont worry about it, just practice and research how to solve them
 eulerscheZahl: and once you solved it, look at other solutions
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 Swagboy: Every part of computer science is different and you often need some time to get used to new things
 eulerscheZahl: i'm serious. you can learn a few things how to code it more efficiently
 Swagboy: So from theorical algorithmics to codingame problem solving, there are new things to learn
 Taseis: Thank you guys i just started using this site as a practice tool and i found it really interesting i just need to remember how  to code again because i was 1 year inactive from programming
 JLukeSkywalker: most of the easy puzzles are logic and or math, and just bending the code you know to fit it. I think that process is something really missing in our current schools
 Taseis: You really made me feel great and i'm not joking about it 
 JLukeSkywalker: they teach you how to code, but not how to apply it, thats what sites like this are for
 jacek: :o
 jacek: they taught me theory but not how to code
 Taseis: Yeah we also had a lot of theory classes and not as many for practicing coding 
 Taseis: excuse my bad english by the way 
 JLukeSkywalker: thats kind of what i meant, in my head theory=how to code, applying = coding
 Taseis: you were right about that 
 JLukeSkywalker: if you know how to do an insertion sort, but not how or where to use it, its kind of pointless
 eulerscheZahl: not the article I was looking for but close enough<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/</a>
 Taseis: nice article i am going to take a look at it :relaxed:
 rav3n256: is there a way to revisit a clash problem
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 VizGhar: You should put the link to FAQ eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 VizGhar: or is it already there?
 Astrobytes: All clashes should output it automatically at the end.
 rav3n256: or have the option after a clash is over
 eulerscheZahl: that's too reasonable Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: and a 95% problem
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 VizGhar: let's ask AutomatonNN maybe?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a problem with the idea of an array of the same numbers of the s
 VizGhar: why he likes you that much euler?
 eulerscheZahl: where did its avatar go?
 JLukeSkywalker: if you hit rank 1 but dont cross the boss, is it worth it to just try submitting the same code again to try for a higher score?
 jacek: youll push other players weaker than boss
 jacek: so eventually youll be higher
 eulerscheZahl: which game? how much below?
 eulerscheZahl: if it's some dead game, it might take ages until someone else tries to promote and submits to push you
 JLukeSkywalker: i was at 29.8, boss is 30.45
 JLukeSkywalker: ultimate tic tac to
 eulerscheZahl: that game still has some activity
 eulerscheZahl: wait unless you improve
 eulerscheZahl: or try teccles
 JLukeSkywalker: teccles?
 jacek: teccles
 jacek: we dont hilight much, do we?
 eulerscheZahl: if you play on an empty micro board, send the opponent straight back to it
 JLukeSkywalker: lol, i do that irl, didnt put it in the code yet
 jacek: playing in center board first works because its not center board but because its first move of teccles? hmmm
 JLukeSkywalker: currently im only checking micro-board for winning or blocking moves and ignoring big board
 JLukeSkywalker: and almost got into silver
 jacek: do you use any search
 JLukeSkywalker: no
 JLukeSkywalker: it can be much improved
 JLukeSkywalker: was surprised it got up that high
 ErrorRazor: I almost got into gold with just picking the best move for the micro board
 eulerscheZahl: even some "MCTS light" can get you into gold
 eulerscheZahl: full random rollouts, track the first move with the highest winrate
 DomiKo: MC can get you into high gold
 reCurse: But what they're doing is probably the most fun they'll ever get out of uttt
 eulerscheZahl: savage
 jacek: oO
 jacek: hmm 24 new othello players but none in wood1 yet
 jacek: its almost as if they dont care abot puzzle of the week quest
 eulerscheZahl: let's do it next week when it's easier
 <b>**eulerscheZahl completed the quest with "Fractal carpet"</b></p><p><img src="/a/54241606493073" /> reCurse: I only care about the trolling dailies
 struct: 34 players jacek
 jacek: mhm
 struct: maybe its in the same level as getting legend in uttt?
 struct: I didnt write the bot
 struct: So I am not really aware of the difficulty
 jacek: it was made by teapot, so its easy
 reCurse: Rude
 DMMVS: hello?
 Jaystah: suh
 Jaystah: ich gib ein fick auf euer fotze nach
 jacek: euler, thats for you
 eulerscheZahl: my first ever ban&#160;:(
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: He seemed like a pleasant fellow...
 eulerscheZahl: well deserved but still. not there's blood on my enter key
 reCurse: You'll get used to it
 Astrobytes: ^
 Westicles: wow, that's like ban golf.  two lines
 reCurse: You should see what the nice fella I kicked this morning wrote me in PM
 reCurse: Got upgraded to a ban
 jacek: i mean, what did he say really?
 Astrobytes: That's always the part I look forward to, the PM.
 eulerscheZahl: German, I wont translate
 jacek: german :scream: good
 jacek: i see, so you banned him for using german&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: nein
 reCurse: Technically correct
 jacek: the best kind of correct
 reCurse: Mayb glad I didn't get a ryzen, the next intel looks yummy
 reCurse: avx-512 on a home cpu finally
 Westicles: Last one had it as well
 reCurse: The 10th gen? No
 Westicles: I got the 10980xe last Jan
 reCurse: Oh xe
 reCurse: Missed that I guess
 struct: Bettter pre order it asap
 reCurse: Currently $250 off :o
 reCurse: Ok where's the catch
 reCurse: Seems way too cheap for what it is
 eulerscheZahl: my dad thought so too when he bought a video card on ebay
 eulerscheZahl: i told him no
 eulerscheZahl: of course he got scammed
 Angecide: how much did he lose
 eulerscheZahl: he opened an incident on ebay and got the money back
 reCurse: Ah lower clocks
 Angecide: ah that's nice
 eulerscheZahl: so just some time and 25€ for an IT shop to testify that he didn't get what he paid for
 reCurse: 18 cores though... :drool:
 struct: leaked prices seem a bit low
 struct: 604$
 struct: for the 11900k
 wjan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f4df6680-9a2e-4aec-aed1-33af285ca131">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f4df6680-9a2e-4aec-aed1-33af285ca131</a>
 reCurse: Damn now I'm torn
 eulerscheZahl: pastebins are back
 eulerscheZahl: confirmed
 reCurse: 11900k for better and cheaper cores or 10980xe for need moar cores
 eulerscheZahl: there are several cooldowns wjan
 eulerscheZahl: the longest is 6h i think
 eulerscheZahl: but depending on how much you spammed, it might really just be a few minutes
 Westicles: The xe motherboard costs a little more.  Quad channel memory instead of dual though
 reCurse: Hmm only have 2 sticks atm
 reCurse: Think 11th gen might be more worth it
 reCurse: Just glad avx-512 is slowly becoming mainstream
 jacek: linus bashed intel for avx512
 jacek: its slows the clcok
 jacek: clock even
 reCurse: Depends how you use it
 Westicles: And you always have to check how much of the instruction set they actually have.
 jacek: even stockfish folks found it wasnt that much different with nnue
 reCurse: I don't get the impression nnue would have much to gain out of avx512
 reCurse: Could be wrong
 Westicles: nice chart at the bottom here
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512</a>

 reCurse: Thanks
 reCurse: Just need to wait for that rocket lake
 jacek: you should be glad for amd. it pushes intel to its limit
 reCurse: I'm not dissing amd
 JLukeSkywalker: nice lol, changed "col" to "2-col" and my bot went from bronze t osilver
 jacek: huh
 JLukeSkywalker: tic-tac-toe
 jacek: oh my
 JLukeSkywalker: if my code found a winning move in column 3, it would place in column 1
 JLukeSkywalker: and not win
 JLukeSkywalker: im smrt
 JLukeSkywalker: that took like an hour to find
 jacek: what i really like doing this ML stuff is doing those cool charts <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/u07jmw4.png">https://i.imgur.com/u07jmw4.png</a>
 reCurse: Might have looked into doing accounting instead, easier
 Angecide: when doing ml for cg do u generally train the model in python and then serialize the weights to c++?
 jacek: you train offline, yeah
 Angecide: but is there any standard choice between training in python vs c++ or is it just based on your own preference, since I assume it is possiblet to get the weights from python to c++? 
 Angecide: they are just numbers in a matrix I guess
 jacek: yeah, they just params to optimize. however you do it, doesnt matter
 Angecide: I see
 jacek: could be python libraries, as they are pretty optimized
 Angecide: yea the accessibility of doing ML in python is really great
 struct: on csb the angle is rounded, floored, ceiled or truncated?
 reCurse: Which angle
 struct: pod angle to next checkpoint
 reCurse: Which league is that
 struct: legend
 reCurse: I thought pod angles were absolute
 reCurse: In any case, they are given to you rounded
 reCurse: The referee keeps the real float
 ErrorRazor: They are absolute, I'm doing csb rn
 struct: I see, thanks
 reCurse: Results in around 5% inaccuracy on average
 struct: lol
 FabioGomes: does anyone know the solution to this&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-lucky-number">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-lucky-number</a>
 ErrorRazor: Yup
 FabioGomes: Fábiooo13#5962 add me on discord
 jacek: i think 21% knows
 ErrorRazor: Why does a private chat pop up every time the chat reconnects even though there are no new messages in it and I've closed it
 Astrobytes: Known bug.
 ErrorRazor: Alright
 zrdzrt: is there any chance that java wins in short mode vs. python? Feels unfair tbh :D
 Nikeleos: Wich language can beat Pyhton in short mode&#160;?
 Hobogre: Ruby will always win
 JLukeSkywalker: also who doesnt know python anyway
 ErrorRazor: I'm not a fan of short mode
 zrdzrt: same
 ErrorRazor: You don't learn anything useful from it
 Nikeleos: Exactly
 struct: ruby perl bash
 ErrorRazor: Maybe just treat it as fast mode
 reCurse: Then you should not be a fan of clash either
 Nikeleos: Bash&#160;? Creapy...
 ErrorRazor: I do prefer the bot games but sometimes it's nice to do something smaller
 Astrobytes: That's why we have puzzles
 ErrorRazor: I'm definitely neglecting the solo puzzles.
 Astrobytes: You'll get more out of it than you will from clashes imo
 ErrorRazor: I shall clash no more
 Astrobytes: Hey don't stop because I said puzzles lol, clash if you feel like it - I think the objective of clashes was 'Fun'
 Astrobytes: But if you want to actually learn anything, then puzzles or whatever
 zhoubou: Puzzles are a great way to have fun while learning. At least for me.
 jacek: "fun" "clash" in one sentence?
 ErrorRazor: "clash not fun"
 rick-James: very cool&#160;:)
 o0lit3: "Ruby will always win" &gt;&gt; perl usually beats ruby tbh
 JLukeSkywalker: but no-one uses perl in clash
 o0lit3: I do
 o0lit3: it generally has a leg up on "fastest" as well because you dont' have to type as much
 ErrorRazor: "no-one" is a pseudonym for "almost no-one"
 o0lit3: you sound like an english teacher and not a programmer
 JLukeSkywalker: sometimes i wish programmers were english teachers, would make code more readable
 ErrorRazor: I wouldn't be a programmer if I didn't like languages
 kavandoctor: wassup people
 kavandoctor: join coc
 kavandoctor: coc is fun
 JLukeSkywalker: or less readable ....
 ErrorRazor: join multiplayer
 kavandoctor: i like coc
 ErrorRazor: multiplayer is fun
 kavandoctor: yeah
 ErrorRazor: I should've said ai battle
 ErrorRazor: Because clash is technically multiplayer too
 Perlorodka: kavandoctor! don't say you improved even more in CoC!&#160;:)
 kavandoctor:&#160;:)
 Perlorodka: I think coding roman to decimal convertor in 38 seconds is already pretty damn good <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/JKIpvQe.png">https://pasteboard.co/JKIpvQe.png</a>
 kavandoctor: bruh
 kavandoctor: ur allowed to look stuff up
 kavandoctor: so i just found a sol online
 kavandoctor: lmao
 Astrobytes: Exact solution?
 Perlorodka: of course, awesome job
 kavandoctor: thanq
 kavandoctor: but i mean
 kavandoctor: that was the only time i did that
 kavandoctor: cuz i didnt feel like
 kavandoctor: writing roman numerals
 Astrobytes: Was it a straight up copy paste?
 kavandoctor: what no
 kavandoctor: i had to change stuff
 kavandoctor: obviously
 Astrobytes: And it took btb all that time to look it up and change some stuff

 drdrdrdoctor: i mean yeah
 drdrdrdoctor: i think that was the only challenge i saw
 drdrdrdoctor: that was p much entirely online
 Astrobytes: (one of many available solutions to the general problem)
 drdrdrdoctor: yeah
 drdrdrdoctor: but i mean 
 drdrdrdoctor: You can look up stuff. You can take your time. You shall have fun. Everyone is a winner, even if 0% of the tests work :D 
 drdrdrdoctor: "You can look up stuff. You can take your time. You shall have fun. Everyone is a winner, even if 0% of the tests work :D "
 drdrdrdoctor: this is what it says
 drdrdrdoctor: on the page
 drdrdrdoctor: so i assumed you were allowed
 drdrdrdoctor: to search stuff up
 Astrobytes: You are, yes.
 Astrobytes: I'm not judging.
 drdrdrdoctor: oh
 drdrdrdoctor: you wanna play?

 Astrobytes: Nah, I don't clash. I prefer bot programming.
 drdrdrdoctor: oh
 drdrdrdoctor: oki
 drdrdrdoctor: i hate bot programming
 drdrdrdoctor: and like clash
 Astrobytes: All good.
 Velcoro: I'd clash, but I hate googling solutions, you know&#160;:)
 reCurse: Wonder why
 drdrdrdoctor: bruh
 drdrdrdoctor: that was like the only question
 drdrdr: that had a online solution
 drdrdr: lay off me
 Astrobytes: Sure.
 Astrobytes: Any pressure you're feeling is completely your own.

 Rockstar555: hii good morning
 dbdr: damn, I pulled MSmits down to #3
 YodaMaster123: In which Multiplayer?
 eulerscheZahl: onitmaa
 dbdr: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: i see smits at #2
 dbdr: now I beat karliso once, so Msmits back to #2 :D
 dbdr: strange, because I made a perf twek but only measured 1% improvement
 eulerscheZahl: and you already left the noob ranks where i'm stuck
 dbdr: *tweak
 dbdr: I was thinking, your eval sounds more expensive, so depth is not the end of story
 dbdr: the grouping part, which I don't have
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure anymore if i have it or wanted to have
 struct: I checked RAIC leaderboard just now
 struct: and the 1st guy seems very strong
 struct: 50~-% winrate
 eulerscheZahl: he won in 2017
 Rockstar555: hii
 eulerscheZahl: and did well in the google ants challenge
 Rockstar555: What was the discussion going on
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ants.aichallenge.org/">http://ants.aichallenge.org/</a>greentae was 2nd
 struct: google doesnt do AI challenges anymore does it?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 Rockstar555: Mathis Lichtenberger this is the winner of this contest
 eulerscheZahl: the user Schneewittchen (mostly active on #De) knows him in person
 struct: Never saw im on #world
 struct: But saw him on leaderboard on some multies
 struct: at least I recognize the avatar
 eulerscheZahl: it's from a fairy tale (both name and avatar)
 struct: Now I know one more word in german
 Rockstar555: hey guys reach gold league in CODE A LA MODE and Coder Strike back
 eulerscheZahl: you also know the word "Zahl"
 Rockstar555: :slight_smile:
 Rockstar555: No
 Rockstar555: can u tell
 Westicles: and Feuerzangenbowle 
 eulerscheZahl: very good
 Rockstar555:  i know eulersche
 Rockstar555: But not Zahl
 dbdr: I know zahl but not scheis that posessive, or diminutive?
 dbdr: eurlerchen would be diminutive maybe :D
 eulerscheZahl: if any, then posessive 
 dbdr: euler's right?
 eulerscheZahl: and yes to the chen
 dbdr: eulerchenscheZahl
 Rockstar555: eulerscheZahl why u choose a Frog as a avtar
 dbdr: your mick is too simple&#160;;)
 dbdr: little known fact, but Leonard Euler was a toad
 Rockstar555: CODINGAME SPRING CHALLENGE 20211,993 CodinGamers have registered to this contest
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i'm not even the only registered player from my company
 Rockstar555: hey Guys this one is best contest in my codingame lifetime
 eulerscheZahl: but iirc i kicked the other one here on the chat. and squiddy later banned him
 Rockstar555: u are saying to me
 eulerscheZahl: no, not everything is about you
 Rockstar555: okk
 Rockstar555: i have to invite also

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Last I knew GMP classes aren't included in the php functions installed/allowed on CG, so I'm not sure if I can circumvent and solve it
 Radman_737: سلام
 Rockstar555: yeah u can try it
 Westicles: You don't really need GMP, it is just sort of helpful

 Rockstar555: i solved
 Rockstar555: this

 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's plenty of big number puzzles I haven't been able to hack solutions for
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well at least its not on easy list

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Rockstar555 there actually is a similar puzzle, i forget the name of it... it's something like, who is in the graden alone...or something
 dbdr: hey MSmits!
 dbdr: MSmits #1
 dbdr: oops, won't be for long :D
 dbdr: he's online but not in chat :thinking:
 jacek: hmm?
 jacek:&#160;:(
 ParticleBeam:&#160;?
 dbdr: sorry jacek
 jacek: ban
 dbdr: top 3 seems random, and I stirred things up&#160;:)
 dbdr: got lucky against you a couple of times I think
 jacek: i wonder what MSmits uses in this game. it can't be booked
 jacek: ahh, maybe you just got winning positions, that would explain a lot
 dbdr: winning start positions?
 dbdr: I think MSmits bitboarded the heck out of it, as usual&#160;;)
 NoobCod3: hey
 eulerscheZahl: he mentioned that he needs 62 bit for the state iirc

 Rockstar555: hii
 eulerscheZahl: there is a "reset input" at the top right in your IDE ChampionCoder
 eulerscheZahl: click that to get some code that parses the new input
 ChampionCoder: ok i'll try it

 Rockstar555: in what
 Rockstar555: PatrickMcGinnisII 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: first my gamestate tree wasn't deep cloning all the changes, so each leaf was operating on bad data
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now i fixed that
 Rockstar555: ohh
 jacek: what game
 Rockstar555: yeah nice question jacek 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and now my backtracking is broken

 Rockstar555: It id medium puzzle 
 Rockstar555: It is medium puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yeah well I had to put in alot of preprocessing because php is so slow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't get deep enough with full tree
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can if i preprocess
 Rockstar555: so choose another programming language

 eulerscheZahl: speak English suleyman-kutukoglu
 Rockstar555: yeah 
 wirdes: okey i speak english
 wirdes: how r u all
 Rockstar555: couldn't counderstand
 suleyman-kutukoglu: sometimes i cant speak perfectly english so generally i use turkish
 wirdes: +1
 Rockstar555: what was this language
 eulerscheZahl: but we don't understand Turkish at all
 suleyman-kutukoglu: but if it is problem for everybody i can speak english
 Rockstar555: yeah
 Rockstar555: i am going to use translator
 brkn: you can't speak english, you can write in English.
 Rockstar555: :laughing:
 wirdes: axlikfşlsdakfsd
 wirdes: brkn right
 suleyman-kutukoglu: sadsakşdjsa
 Rockstar555: stop it 
 eulerscheZahl: by this point i'm tempted to kick. you've been warned
 Rockstar555: hey eluerscheZahl what u do at tonight
 eulerscheZahl: i'll be sleeping then
 Rockstar555: any contribution from your side
 Rockstar555: :smile:
 Rockstar555: Smart answer
 eulerscheZahl: not before RAIC ends
 wirdes: rockstar55
 wirdes: sdlkfjalksdf is mean haha in turkish
 Rockstar555: okk
 Rockstar555: stop it
 eulerscheZahl: looks more like hitting random letters on your keyboard
 Rockstar555: this is too much
 Rockstar555: speak english otherwise use translator
 Rockstar555: hey eulerscheZahl  CODINGAME SPRING CHALLENGE 2021 it is starting at  may 06 2021 is it so far
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you have to be patient
 YodaMaster123: Is the name yet to be decided? I noticed that most contests are named after movies.
 eulerscheZahl: the last 2 have no special name anymore
 YodaMaster123: Oh... Spring and Fall challenges 2020
 AntiSquid: you can call them Pacman and Spice Girls, most suitable names YodaMaster123
 eulerscheZahl: only you say spice girls
 AntiSquid: only one calling it as it is
 Gabbek: Hello everyone&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: greetings
 eulerscheZahl: :wave:
 Gabbek: Could anyone explain to me why it is invalid move: '52' in FreeCell?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/514043421">https://www.codingame.com/replay/514043421</a>
 suleyman-kutukoglu: we cant open this link
 AntiSquid: click share replay again
 eulerscheZahl: OupsAn error occurred (#UNAUTHORIZED): "You are not authorised to view replay 514043421".
 Gabbek: Seems like supermove combining 3-8 cards, but it's invalid for some reason, hmm
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/514043421">https://www.codingame.com/replay/514043421</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can't share replays when the puzzle is not approved
 Gabbek: oh, I see
 AntiSquid: make a video
 AntiSquid: perfect opportunity for a stream
 eulerscheZahl: a screenshot will suffice
 Gabbek: I'm wondering what will happen - there's one left day for validation. I wanted to thumbs it up, but so far I haven't solved it&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: trictrac made hanabi&#160;? O__O
 AntiSquid: why call it fireworks 
 eulerscheZahl: CodinBot will refuse the contribution. but the creator can put it up for approval again
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/OfoW5Qd">https://imgur.com/a/OfoW5Qd</a>
 Gabbek: seems like supermove to me, moving 3-8 rank cards from 5th pile to the 2nd one 
 eulerscheZahl: you want to move 5 cards at once
 eulerscheZahl: but only have 1 free spot at the top and 1 cascade
 eulerscheZahl: that allows to move 4 at once
 eulerscheZahl: moving blocks is just for convenience
 eulerscheZahl: you can move single cards only
 Gabbek: ohh
 eulerscheZahl: move 1 up, then the 2nd to the casecase
 eulerscheZahl: 3rd up
 eulerscheZahl: 4th somewhere else
 eulerscheZahl: then revert the intermediate steps
 sirsatan: @AntiSquid 'Spice Girls' is great
 Gabbek: I missunderstood it, that explains the issue very well :D
 Gabbek: thank you very much eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: i know SirSushi, but these people don't want to admit it
 Romil: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: not sure what i did to get to the top of the leaderboard
 AntiSquid: sirsatan *  how many sir somethings are there
 sirsatan: today im SirSanta&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i see satan
 Gabbek: hehe
 sirsatan: use def Anagram(sirsatan):&#160;;)
 Gabbek: anything interesting going on lately? I've been slacking really hard for the last 2 weeks or so.
 sirsatan: I wonder is there any problem to save my code after press 'PRESS MY CODE' button
 AntiSquid: uncooperative version of hanabi is WIP Gabbek 
 eulerscheZahl: we have the first 3D puzzle pending now <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/862009d303ad01e86e3f0537f622e3764fe182">https://www.codingame.com/demo/862009d303ad01e86e3f0537f622e3764fe182</a>
 sirsatan: today my changes disappered
 AntiSquid: Wolf 3D when?
 eulerscheZahl: when you make it
 Gabbek: sirsatan never had similar issue
 Gabbek: wow, that's so cool :o
 sirsatan: i got 2-3 times for last month
 eulerscheZahl: it happens sometimes that your code disappears
 eulerscheZahl: only submit will store it permanently
 sirsatan: next time i will copy to text file 
 eulerscheZahl: or just submit
 Gabbek: I think my next goal will be to go through pending puzzles and check them out
 eulerscheZahl: lots of clashes there
 eulerscheZahl: i think the questmap is partially responsible for that
 Gabbek: I haven't touched any clash, so I guess I'll just check out other puzzles. But before I do that I want to solve this FreeCell, need to change few things because I'm not handling auto-play correctly
 Gabbek: How long does it usually take to approve a new puzzle?
 Gabbek: I guess it can take a while, right? 3 approvals required, people have to solve it (or I guess that's optional?), hmm.
 eulerscheZahl: the fastest approvals are around 10min
 eulerscheZahl: the longest is about 4 months i think
 eulerscheZahl: neighbor sum grid was pending really long
 Gabbek: adding blockout as next goal, after freecell, hopefully I'll be able to provide some feedback on the next weekend.
 LastRick: It takes a while because I suspect the pool of users that can and actually do solve the "classic puzzles" is small and they're the same users active (and otherwise busy) on the other parts of the site.
 Rockstar555: HII
 Gabbek: Good day
 LastRick: morning
 Kamal-Kumar-Jena: hiiiii
 jacek: oh, someone pushed karliso up :unamused:
 MSmits: which game is this?
 jacek: onitama
 MSmits: ahh ok
 ParticleBeam: Amazing how far one can get with random moves
 MSmits: which game?
 MSmits: still onitama?
 ParticleBeam: I am trying that at the moment
 MSmits: it's a great game
 MSmits: it's chess-like
 MSmits: except the pieces don't have different moves, the cards do
 eulerscheZahl: i like the asymmetric aspect that the cards give. X can capture Y but Y can't do the same with X
 MSmits: yeah that's a funny part
 MSmits: it's pretty easy to solve though. 
 MSmits: except there's too many card combos to make use of this
 eulerscheZahl: and 50ms isn't that much time
 MSmits: yeah I meant offline
 eulerscheZahl: i got that
 MSmits: I am pretty sure you can solve any combo in less than a day on standard hardware
 MSmits: there's so few possible boardstates
 Hannnn: gualgualagual
 MSmits: I think it's like 10^12 or 13 or something
 Hannnn: hey wtsup guys
 eulerscheZahl: let's make a new contribution with a larger board :P
 MSmits: nah, this one's fine
 eulerscheZahl: just to ruin your bitboards
 MSmits: I wasnt able to abuse this feature and I would have
 MSmits: if I could
 MSmits: would sure ruin my bitboards yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: it fits so close
 MSmits: I use 31 bit lol
 MSmits: err 62 that is
 MSmits: maybe a larger version would neatly fit in 128 though
 MSmits: like most games
 MSmits: btw, I am doing a game design course atm, as a student I mean
 karliso: I coded a stronger version of my onitama bot somewhere in July, but didn't submit coz my current version was still beating you guys (I think). You have given up in the game already?
 MSmits: I have
 MSmits: doesnt mean i will never come back to it, but there's soooo many other games
 MSmits: probably at least a year before i get back to it
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like blasterpoard he declares having a stronger bot for Kutulu than the current #1
 karliso: MSmits Which is ur favourite atm?
 eulerscheZahl: that's a tough question
 MSmits: karliso do you mean which game I like most, or which game I am currently working on?
 karliso: currently
 MSmits: mmh, well I havent been working on cg much lately, but I have a list of things i want to do
 MSmits: i need to get a bandas feature to work
 MSmits: D&amp;B has to be finished
 karliso: oh, I have not looked at bandas long time. Does my current version still beat you?
 MSmits: checkers 3 piece end game db and meta mcts
 MSmits: barely karliso
 MSmits: probably if i submit 50 times, i will sometimes get nr 1
 karliso: I added some endgame to bandas as you suggested, it helped.
 MSmits: it certainly does
 MSmits: did you go as far as 3x4?
 MSmits: I think that's the absolute limit
 karliso: I need to look that up.
 MSmits: because it's 12 squares and 13 doesn't exist
 MSmits: 14 would be 2x7 and require 10x as much space
 karliso: yes, I do have 4x3
 MSmits: cool we have the same db then
 karliso: But...
 MSmits: unless you did a fractional db for 4x4 or something
 MSmits: or you did some fancy compression
 karliso: My 4x3 is coded for one... 
 MSmits: what does that mean?
 karliso: Like there were flippings and rotations
 MSmits: ah yes
 karliso: But I don't think I implemented all of them
 MSmits: ahh ok, I managed to get them all in. It's pretty messy to do though
 MSmits: with all the rotations and mirrors
 MSmits: I think the rest of your bot is just better than mine
 MSmits: so even if my db is a little more complete i still lose a bit more
 MSmits: did you do mcts with heuristics?
 MSmits: mine is just plain mcts
 karliso: I do some stuff I learnt from uttt
 MSmits: sure, but that could be anything hehe
 MSmits: I always learn stuff between games and try them
 MSmits: I noticed you went full on teccles on uttt, cutting the heuristic off at ply 20
 MSmits: for both p1 and p2
 karliso: well
 jacek: try teccles on bandas :v
 MSmits: :P
 karliso: There is no need to switch for p1.
 MSmits: you mean theres no need to stop the heuristic?
 karliso: And I think iti s not 100% as p2.
 MSmits: hmm i did see some instances where the heuristic was bad for p1, in late game
 MSmits: but maybe if you play better, this never happens
 karliso: yes, I think you can always win as p1 if you follow this heuristic.
 karliso: Meaning you gonna win if the rest of your moves are ok.
 MSmits: seems likely
 MSmits: but hard to be sure
 MSmits: thats why it is not good to have an opening book as p2
 jacek: sounds like a challenge
 MSmits: yeah it is a challenge and one I have tried a few times
 karliso: jacek Is your onitama bot mcts or minimax?
 MSmits: so far karliso seems to be right
 jacek: jacekmax
 MSmits: karliso in other words, UCT guided minimax, backpropagating eval value
 karliso: yeah
 MSmits: not adding, but replacing highest value
 MSmits: ahh kk you are aware of it then
 karliso: what?
 MSmits: jaceks favorite search
 jacek: its world renowned
 MSmits: jacekmax
 karliso: oh, I misread, I have no idea what is that.
 MSmits: you expand like mcts
 jacek: consider it MCTS with EPT 0 depth
 MSmits: then eval all children
 MSmits: and backpropagate minimax style
 MSmits: use uct to choose what to expand
 jacek: whats your eval in onitama, karliso
 MSmits: jacek thats what  i use on onitama, but i add up scores, you replace them
 jacek: is it complicated
 karliso: well
 MSmits: mine is pretty complicated, have a bunch of features with params. 
 karliso: It is bugged and not very good
 karliso: not the best part of my bot
 MSmits: what do you think is best?
 MSmits: without giving it away i mean
 jacek: well my bot is pretty slow
 karliso: I saw onitama bot on github where it did eval of peaces.
 karliso: I don't have that.
 karliso: I have coverage scores instead/
 MadKnight: hey MSmits what are u doing&#160;?
 jacek: peace :v_tone1:
 MadKnight: raic&#160;?
 MSmits: no, dont have that much time MadKnight, just fixing small stuff about bots
 MSmits: karliso coverage score means you can capture opponents using cards?
 karliso: My onitama bot could be improved a lot, but I need motivation.
 jacek: i was 1st but dbdr pushed you up
 karliso: A += (int64_t)popcount(COV) + (int64_t)popcount(COV &amp; 0b00000'11111'11111'01110'00000);
 MSmits: karliso, jaceks bot is stronger than yours atm
 MSmits: so you have motivation
 dbdr: :angel:
 karliso: Is it?
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/maxbennedich/onitama/blob/master/src/main/java/onitama/ai/evaluation/PieceSquareTables.java">https://github.com/maxbennedich/onitama/blob/master/src/main/java/onitama/ai/evaluation/PieceSquareTables.java</a>
 MSmits: I did tests a while ago
 MSmits: my bot is similar to yours in strength i think, maybe slightly weaker, but jaceks is quite a bit stronger than mine
 MSmits: jacek didnt you train a network for this as well?
 jacek: ntuple
 MSmits: thats pretty much a network
 MSmits: in the sense that you do the same things in training it
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: except you give it patterns in advance
 MSmits: instead of letting it discover them
 karliso: Oh, I did nt notice jacek submitted in october.
 MSmits: by the way jacek, you may have to retrain your oware soon :P
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: more endtables?
 MSmits: opening book now beats every NN except yours as p1. I beat it as p2 already with 60%
 jacek: good, i need motivation
 MSmits: wait till i submit, then retrain it
 jacek: as karliso knows, being 1st is a curse
 MSmits: should be nr 1 again
 MSmits: the funny thing about opening books is i can keep growing it. I wonder for oware, if I can keep growing it until you run out of meaningful variations
 MSmits: the game is so simple, that there arent so many different moves that are good
 MSmits: so the branching for an opening book vs a good bot is very tiny
 MSmits: maybe 1.3 or so
 MSmits: your random is what's slowing me down. I had agade and robo done as 100% win in days
 MSmits: recur se also has random
 MSmits: but the bot makes more mistakes than yours
 jacek: good thing the winter is coming, you can save money on heating by doing metamcts
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's a little boring though, for this game
 MSmits: I have no clue why moves are good and dont see the strategy thats happening
 MSmits: for uttt it's easier even
 MSmits: I can look at yavalath meta mcts all day, it's very fun
 MSmits: the game is just more strategic
 MSmits: as far as a human can tell anyway
 123456789LL: Hi

 struct: very bad
 jacek: you speculate too much
 MSmits: i do&#160;?
 MSmits: oh struct
 MSmits: well i do too
 MSmits: it says bad speculation
 MSmits: ohh I see, that means your ifs are screwy
 struct: yeah, this happens when i place a piece
 struct: and on floodfill
 MadKnight: say no to branches
 MadKnight: say no to conditional jumps and to variable jumps
 MadKnight: ezpz
 MadKnight: write code with no ifs
 MadKnight: if(stuff) a+=xjust replace it with a+=x*(stuff==true)
 jacek: no ifs? so use switches
 MadKnight: no conditional jumps jacek
 reCurse: If optimizing was that easy
 reCurse: It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad
 reCurse: Something to look into but any program has to be bound by something
 MadKnight: ifs only in top-level parts
 MadKnight: like main and reading inputs
 reCurse: Ifs everywhere until proven otherwise
 reCurse: Caring too much about it is as bad as caring not enough
 AntiSquid: if (win.found()) break; 
 MadKnight: struct was asking that, not me
 MadKnight: struct really likes to optimize stuff
 reCurse: Yeah but your suggestion can sometimes be misleading
 MadKnight: i was kinda joking about no ifs at all
 reCurse: Ok then sorry it wasn't obvious
 MadKnight: u can kinda say that's a top-level if, AntiSquid
 jacek: use structs, not classes. more lightweight
 MadKnight: in c#&#160;?
 MadKnight: it just makes them value-type jacek
 VizGhar: Hey guys... Just looking at the UTTT, how many simulations are you able to run on first 2 runs with MCTS? I'd like to have some "benchmark" beforehand
 struct: my bot is not great but I have 20-25k+-?
 struct: rollouts
 ProCrazyCoder: oh no
 ProCrazyCoder: i m so bad at programming((
 VizGhar: thanks struct&#160;:) - let's dive into it
 struct: and that number is for 2nd turn only
 struct: on first turn i just play on middle if im player 1
 VizGhar: Yeah... maybe some "observed" moves from beginning might help, to reduce tree size and still drawing good moves... I just have to start with regular MCTS
 VizGhar: wonder how far can I get... quite new domain for me
 VizGhar: Also, yesterday I've seen someone mentioning pragmas for C++ I'm mostly Kotlin dev, that knows how to write basic C++ code. Where do I find how to use these pragmas?
 VizGhar: ideally directly with CG
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/c-and-the-o3-compilation-flag/1670">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/c-and-the-o3-compilation-flag/1670</a>
 struct: usually I use these
 struct: #pragma GCC optimize("O3","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 VizGhar: god bless you :D Now I hopefully have all i need
 jrke: what is black color int in java basically for CG sdk
 struct: what do you mean jrke?
 jrke: like i wanna dosprite.setColor(Black);
 struct: you want the int that represents black color?
 jrke: so what should be the value of Black
 jrke: yes - 'you want the int that represents black color?'
 struct: 0
 VizGhar: 0x000000 = 0
 jrke: oh thanks
 struct: white = 0xffffff
 jrke: is there any website where i can find many colors int?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.color-hex.com/">https://www.color-hex.com/</a>
 jrke: thenks
 struct: just replace the # by 0x
 VizGhar: Material design colors (some nice selection of colors)
 reCurse: Generally try to avoid pure white and pure black
 struct: Usually I try to replace white by light grey 
 struct: But Im not a designer so Im not sure if its good or not
 VizGhar: And if you are talking about sprites right away, why not to use some shiny nice colors?&#160;:) red/green/blue/yellow/orange/purple
 reCurse: Doesn't have to be super gray, as long as it's something like 240-255 should be fine
 reCurse: Also same applies to colors, try to stay away from programmer colors (anything with 255 and 0 in components)
 reCurse: *240-250
 jrke: i am doing it first time i will improve it
 reCurse: wait *240-245
 reCurse: ugh
 Presac: Are there only 4 code golf's?

 jacek: meow
 eulerscheZahl: futile or fertile? :thinking:
 Westicles: you can do random in cgfunge?
 eulerscheZahl: if (random) print("PRIME")else print actual solution
 eulerscheZahl: with very little randomness (maybe 5%) you still have a chance to pass all testcases and cut off a few points from the total score
 Westicles: I see, very sneaky
 dbdr: if someone starts it, others will too, and the shorter deterministic will still win I think
 eulerscheZahl: true
 eulerscheZahl: but if only one does it and the others didn't even think about it...
 eulerscheZahl: well, now the idea is out in public
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: your fault or mine?
 eulerscheZahl: 50-50
 eulerscheZahl: i just said "advice" here in public and you used "deterministic" in the reply
 eulerscheZahl: then i gave it all away
 Westicles: If xevi starts on samegame I'll tweet her a hint
 jacek: her?
 eulerscheZahl: you can share that hint with us
 eulerscheZahl: or do you mean hint about random to save your same game lead?
 Westicles: yeah, the latter
 eulerscheZahl: :D

 CursingLlama: I find shortest code rather stupid. Never gonna win that against python using c++.
 MSmits: then dont use c++
 MSmits: the idea is not that every language should be equally good
 MSmits: a lumberjack will not complain that his hammer does not take down the tree as well as the axe does
 JBM: or the chainsaw
 MSmits: or that
 JBM: where's that doom multi
 MSmits: people have been doing 3D, who knows
 AntiSquid: you're reading chainsaw man manga too JBM&#160;?
 JBM: errrr no
 AntiSquid: for a moment i thought you're cool .
 jacek: what is it about?
 Maxim251: Helo, I am trying to figureout pikaptcha detective 2, and I have question about how long takes to you to finnish practice games?
 Maxim251: I am now working on it 3 days
 AntiSquid: it's a story about a boy and his dog, jacek
 jacek: like ed...ward?
 Maxim251: normally what average of time is to finish particular games?
 Maxim251: Is few days to write code for medium practice game to finish it? Like one week?
 struct: for puzzles?
 Maxim251: yes
 AntiSquid: you mean edward scissors hands&#160;? well he can retract the saws back into his arms like wolverine
 struct: They are meant to take time
 struct: all depends on your skill level
 Maxim251: and one week to make it is normal?
 jacek: depends on puzzle, could be hours if you have experience with the algorithm. 1 week isnt bad
 Maxim251: Almos all games in easy level I have finished with 100%, and now i make medium ones, and my average is one week. or shorter. 
 AntiSquid: well considering contests usually last 10 days, i guess you have to do it in 10 days Maxim251
 Maxim251: I was worry that I am not so good ifI take so much time.
 AntiSquid: are you talking about puzzles or multiplayer? confused .
 Maxim251: puzles
 AntiSquid: ah ok
 struct: Just take your time.
 Maxim251: Thats good..
 AntiSquid: no rush for puzzles, they only give XP anyway
 jacek: well, some hard puzzles were easier for me than medium ones
 struct: Im sure after you do a puzzle if you have a similar problem
 struct: then you will be able to solve it faster
 Westicles: That is an easy puzzle, it shouldn't take so long
 Maxim251: Thats good, Thank You.  
 Westicles: You can study the other solutions
 struct: rollercoaster and the surface should be medium I think
 Maxim251: Yes, on easy puzles it take me not longer that week. Like 3 days, 4 days.
 struct: On rollercoaster if you solve it in javascript you dont even need to optimize it
 struct: bruteforce works
 struct: How long have you been coding for?
 Maxim251: I am nooby, I learned c++ 2 months ago, and codingame is greate for exercise.
 AlgoN: yeh
 Westicles: Oh, in that case you are fine
 Maxim251: Good to know. 
 struct: In 1 year you will solve the easy in under 10 minutes
 Maxim251: Thats why I come with that cuestion
 struct: It all depends on your experiencey
 struct: Hard to compare 2 months vs years
 Maxim251: I see on Youtube other programists that they was typing straight from head and that was looking so easy
 struct: Also what Westicles suggested can be helpfull, check other players solutions
 struct: After you solve a puzzle you can check them
 Maxim251: I do, I do&#160;:) 
 Maxim251: Always when I finish puzzle, I check first 15 peoples how they do. Sometimes I fill embarased when I see how short code they have.&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: some people love to code-golf everything ...
 struct: Short doesnt mean good
 Maxim251: yes, I see, but I don't feel so strong to do code-golf... But I feel better knowing that I do, as begginer that I am not so bad with time to finish puzzle. 
 Maxim251: I think I know what You want to say. I notice code that they get data straight from input and they passing to output in one turn. like not using any container to store data, 
 AntiSquid: code-golf isn't strength, it's madness
 Maxim251: I like store all data from input, and then work with it.
 Maxim251: Thanks for answares  guys&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 therealbeef: code-golf can let you look at a language in new ways. you can learn stuff that could be useful down the road. But I think beginners shouldn't focus on that; it can lead to bad habits.
 jacek: but your coworkers will love making the review of your code
 Gabbek: JBM hello, do you have a moment?&#160;:)
 JBM: depends
 Gabbek: I'm trying to solve FreeCell, I have one or two questions if you have a minute
 JBM: shoot
 Gabbek: I'm having big issue with autoplay, let me show you a screenshot, as replay doesn't work until mission is approved
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvvKX.gif">https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvvKX.gif</a>
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/44nXig0">https://imgur.com/a/44nXig0</a>
 Maxim251: ok, thanks
 Gabbek: 2 of spades gets placed on foundation, but 3 of spade doesn't - and my sequence of moves tries to make it into a situation where 2-6 of spades will get placed on foundation, but... I'm confused when I'm supposed to output my move to home and when it will be filled in automatically with auto-play
 Gabbek: I manually added "3h" to my moves sequence and then it gets much further
 JBM: i see
 JBM: for now the agme implements the ms rules (to the best of my understanding of it)
 JBM: "Microsoft FreeCell or FreeCell Pro only plays an available card to its homecell automatically when all of the lower-ranked cards of the opposite color are already on the homecells (except that a two is played if the corresponding ace is on its homecell); aces are always played when available."
 JBM: from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html">http://solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html</a>
 JBM: there's a change in the plan to make autoplay optional, which might make your life easier
 JBM: i'd also like to find a way to make it more tolerant to ambiguous moves, but I don't have a clear path for that one yet
 JBM: it *is* still best practice to interrupt early games that took a wrong turn
 Gabbek: I totally understand that, I just couldn't understand why it wasn't being autoplayed, that explains it quite well for a noob like me&#160;:)
 JBM: ok
 JBM: "aces and twos are autoplayed when possible" is a good summary
 Gabbek: I doubt I'll be able to finish it tomorrow, but I'm more than happy to work on it more once you'll resubmit it again - I would like to approve it once I'm able to solve it, as it's really well done
 Gabbek: finish it today*
 JBM: great!
 Gabbek: I've never played freecell before, so the note about aces and twos will be most likely helpful for others as well
 JBM: thanks for taking a look
 Gabbek: it's a pleasure, the least I can do for so much work put into it&#160;:)
 JBM: yes i don't mention autoplay details too much yet in the statement
 JBM: i intended to dive deeper when I'd actually give the option to swich modes
 Gabbek: I think I've stumbled upon this issue earlier, but I just didn't realize it as I had much worse debug, so I didn't really know what was going on
 Westicles: no plans to add undo, right?
 JBM: no
 JBM: i'd lol, but then...
 JBM: is it useful?
 Westicles: It would probably make it much much easier, so not a good idea.  But good for us dumb guys
 JBM: i'll think about it ;p
 Gabbek: "much much easier" - this made me curious, is the intended way of doing it by using available moves provided as input and nothing else?
 JBM: well you can attempt an exhaustive search that way
 JBM: but i don't think there's much chance of it succeeding in the allowed turn limit
 Gabbek: okey, I see. I couldn't find a use for provided available moves, but it's useful for debugging purposes and verification of your own availalbe moves
 JBM: when the referee doesn't crash, it's an easy way to know in advance a move will succeed
 JBM: (the referee doesn't crash anymore-AFAIK)
 Gabbek: that's a good point
 JBM: but that can really only be of help at the start
 JBM: i suppose when you get to the point of solving it you've "simply" converged with the referee's idea of valid moves
 Gabbek: it's useful at the start for learning the rules and validation - that's for sure&#160;:)
 struct: Finally I think I finished it

 Maxim251: I have very importand question, i s about pointers
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec3f2635-5399-4a7a-b027-cc4e56d00565">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec3f2635-5399-4a7a-b027-cc4e56d00565</a>
 Maxim251: Why this code is workin???
 struct: Why is it working?
 struct: Well you are passing the pointer to the function
 Maxim251: Yes, function dont use pointers, 
 struct: char* betty
 struct: Its a pointer
 Maxim251: Passing betty by reference should work only using with pointers, but this one don't use that. 
 Maxim251: betty[1] = 'd';
 Maxim251: betty should have pointer, yeah?
 struct: When you call passbyreference(betty);
 struct: you are sending the first address  of betty
 Maxim251: When I use betty as normal char { *betty = d } it works, but { *betty[2] = 'd'; } dont work
 struct: You want to change the value right?
 Maxim251: It shouldn't be like thiss&#160;? passbyreference(&amp;betty);
 Maxim251: yes.
 struct: No because berry is an array
 struct: betty*
 therealbeef: my advice: use std::array instead of 'raw' array, and references instead of pointers
 Maxim251: And when I use array, then this char container is acting diferently?
 Westicles: You should never use pointers unless you are porting code by a person who foolishly used pointers
 struct: Averaged around 1.4mill in that game
 struct: moves per turn
 Maxim251: Thats wired property, I am learning code 3 months, but never in tutorials I didn't see this version
 Maxim251: And I agree that pointers are bad, and i should use them only in special case. In one game I was forced to use pointer, to prevent function to output array of char, and this one property schock me.
 Maxim251: Heh, QTCreator, they use pointers at level of insane :D
 therealbeef: Qt is not always nice, in my experience
 Maxim251: But I see that many companies are using Qt, and to be able find job in future, Qt should be good choice....
 therealbeef: basically, the 'name' of an array can be assigned to a pointer and the resulting pointer will point to the first element. [1] adds 1 and dereferences
 struct: [1] == ptr + 1
 Maxim251: this is in side of function 
 Maxim251: void passbyreference(char *betty){
 struct: So what should that function be doing just to see if I understand
 therealbeef: [1] = *(ptr+1)
 Maxim251: and in side of fuction, I use betty like normal array.
 Maxim251: But goot to know that wired property... In future I hope that it will not suprise me if I will do similar thing in future. Thanks for reply therealbeef
 Maxim251: #struct The cod e should manipulate array of char, but there is wired property of a pointer. 
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24a461d2-0d92-4b54-98d0-a4def0b58dc8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24a461d2-0d92-4b54-98d0-a4def0b58dc8</a>
 struct: it is manipulating, I dont see anything weird
 Maxim251: #struct, play with it little bit. To see how acts 
 Maxim251: For me it is, first time I see this type. Nobody on Youtube teachers didn't mentioned about that property.
 therealbeef: betty is of type char[4], which the compiler can always convert to type char*
 therealbeef: so the betty inside the function is exactly the same betty as in main
 Maxim251: But when I do betty as char betty then I need use asterix always
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9a29fdf-f6b9-498e-99e1-60e900393743">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9a29fdf-f6b9-498e-99e1-60e900393743</a>
 therealbeef: (except that the length of the array is lost, but that is a nother story)
 Maxim251: No, I was able to add betty[2] = 'd', and output in main function that?
 struct: yes, it should be like that
 Maxim251: Aha.. Thank You for responce. That's very importand lesson for me to day.
 Maxim251: Thanks guys.&#160;:)
 therealbeef: betty is type char[4]/char*, so &amp;betty is char**, but that can be assigned to char*, so betty inside the function is a pointer to a pointer to char(s), so you need to peel of one pointer-layer with *betty and then [1]
 therealbeef: pointers are evil
 therealbeef: if you use std::array&lt;char,4&gt; you get a nice object and pass to the function by copy or by ref with std::array&lt;char,4&gt;&amp;
 Maxim251: Ok, I will test it too.
 therealbeef: succes
 Maxim251: #therealbeef I hate pointers from begginning of learning, and future artickles about it give me this same thinking like You about pointers in program. Few days ago, I see on cppcon explanation about how procesor works and how compiler make 'comands' for procesor, This person say, that compiler is enough smart and coders dont have a reason to use pointers to make program faster. Actually, there was no boost of speed.
 therealbeef: I agree
 Maxim251: I also remember Bios Stromburg, -&lt; Sorry, I know I spell his name terribly wrong, He is father of c++ and he said that He dont understand why peoples are using poiters in that way, if pointers was created for diferent porpouse, and it should be avoided ass much ass posible, and pointers was created for use in function, to prevent big data be copied twice
 therealbeef: Bjarne Stroustrup
 Maxim251: Yes, Thank You
 therealbeef: the idea of C++ is that you get all the nice abstractions like classes without any performance impact over C
 Maxim251: :sweat:
 Maxim251: He also was hoping that C users will move to C++ as next generation of coding, but somehow didnt succeed. I think it is because of Obiect orientation. Even for me its bit hard to us ethem, but I hardly exercise them.&#160;:)
 Maxim251: I see that Obiect oriented is very usefull to group bunch staff... Only I need train my self a lot more
 Maxim251: Thanks and have Nice Day
 nsrsn: asd
 Maxim251: I need say that.. I hate that many peoples are using 3 or 4 languages and they use ass c++, Its like mixing styles from C or C# .. Now I now hor recognise that styles, but at beggining of my learning, this types of styles, make my hard days to understand, it confused me a lot

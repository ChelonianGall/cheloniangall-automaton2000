 meh1001: not really sure what you mean
 NinjaDoggy: yea for example
 NinjaDoggy: if both players repeatedly learn index 1
 NinjaDoggy: then a lot of blues will accumulate on index 0
 miszu: ohh I see
 Rodrigo_the_coder: any code?
 NinjaDoggy: your name is Rodrigo_the_coder...
 Donotalo: i'm running a large bfs, it's searching more than 40K nodes, but still doesn't look for the nodes i'm looking for
 NinjaDoggy: code your own&#160;;)
 Rodrigo_the_coder: help
 Rodrigo_the_coder: it
 NinjaDoggy: make sure you don't have repeated nodes?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: where's da code&#160;:(
 Donotalo: i made sure
 NinjaDoggy: "but still doesn't look for the nodes i'm looking for"
 NinjaDoggy: how far is that?
 Donotalo: at depth 3/4/5
 Donotalo: sorry
 NinjaDoggy: also double check that your eval function will prefer them over other ones i guess
 Donotalo: at depth 10+
 NinjaDoggy: try setting break points
 Donotalo: somehow the nodes i'm looking for is filtered out and not getting into the bfs queue
 NinjaDoggy: oh
 Donotalo: at depth 10+, it's very very difficult to debug, currently i've no idea
 JohnCM: more spells, less rest
 NinjaDoggy: ok yea I ran into similar issues
 NinjaDoggy: try to look for end game stuff
 Donotalo: what did you do?
 NinjaDoggy: i fixed at least 10+ bugs debuggin last few turns
 Donotalo: indeed, i'm looking for end game stuff
 Donotalo: oh, ok
 NinjaDoggy: do you know exactly what states you're looking for?
 NinjaDoggy: I assume you have some function that takes in a state
 NinjaDoggy: and determines if it's worth putting into the bfs queue right?
 NinjaDoggy: just check for those exact properties? and see why it doesn't make it in?
 NinjaDoggy: hope this helps
 NinjaDoggy: and i guess if you don't, it's worth writing one
 Donotalo: my eval function is simple, i'm looking for more number of brews in less depth
 Donotalo: but the bfs never had more than 2 brews, while i'm trying to reach as many as 6
 Donotalo: from the starting state
 NinjaDoggy: um...
 NinjaDoggy: with depth = 10
 NinjaDoggy: it's not that unreasonable
 NinjaDoggy: assuming you're cashing out often
 NinjaDoggy: and not keeping a huge inventory
 Topjimmies: my code is timing out at depth 3
 Donotalo: i'm not looking for time out, i'm trying to code it first
 Donotalo: my code searches for 20 depth
 Donotalo: i'll optimize time later
 Donotalo: from starting state + 8 spells learnt, i can see that within 20 turns there are at least 3 brews
 Donotalo: but this bfs never sees more than 2 and this bugs me
 Csipcsirip: U reach 20 depth without pruning&#160;?
 Topjimmies: timing my code I'm showing 40-120 ms
 Donotalo: Csip: i'm trying to get answer first
 Donotalo: the code is definitely filtering out more nodes than i expect
 Donotalo: that's why it never brews more than 2 from starting state + 8 learnt spells
 Donotalo: i'm trying to figure out where the bug is and how to debug at 10+ depth
 Csipcsirip: you only have your actual score in eval func&#160;?
 Donotalo: honestly, i'm not evaluating state scores
 Donotalo: as long as a node is unvisited and depth &lt; 20, i push it into the bfs queue
 Donotalo: still something gets filtered out
 Donotalo: i'm not pushing invalid inventory configuration
 Donotalo: that's all evaluation for now
 Csipcsirip: but you filter nodes
 Csipcsirip: right&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: so they not just "disappaer"
 Donotalo: correct
 Csipcsirip: and u're not filtering by eval score&#160;?
 Donotalo: correct
 Csipcsirip: some heuristics or&#160;?
 Donotalo: i don't think so
 Donotalo: it's plain bfs
 Sajori: Donotalo, just a thought, how are you testing if you can brew a potion?
 Csipcsirip: bfs itself doesnt filter nodes
 Shparki: is there anyway to get a scenario as a test file? Or do I just have to print me way to it? 
 Donotalo: i just checked, the bfs reached node 20 but searched 30K nodes from starting state + 8 learnt spells, is that normal?
 Lysk: it seems low
 Csipcsirip: ^
 Donotalo: @Sajori, i'm adding inventory items with action deltas, if any inventory item is negative or more than 10, then that can't be brewed
 Donotalo: @Lysk, yes i also think so, i'm trying to figure out how to debug at depth 1=+
 Csipcsirip: U count repetable spells too&#160;?
 Donotalo: yes
 Donotalo: repeat at most 5 times as long as my inventory can accomodate
 Csipcsirip: dunno then. but honestly u dont need 20 depth to reach gold. if u brew the next potion asap it should be enough
 Donotalo: in my current code i just do that, but it only brings me top 50 silver
 Donotalo: so to reach gold and climb up the ladder i'm trying a simulation
 Donotalo: i'm not that good at simulation, trying to push my limit
 Csipcsirip: you cant tell how to brew the next potion asap without simulation
 Csipcsirip: imo
 ukkkfa: hello machinolas
 Donotalo: oh, yeah i simulate my inventory to reach all 5 target orders, that's my current arena code
 miszu: now sometimes I beat the boss in bronze
 Csipcsirip: U shouldnt bother simulating all 5 at first imo. focusing on the next potion should be enough
 miszu: that's progress
 Donotalo: i simulate to all 5 potions, then figure out what to brew next
 Donotalo: sometimes it's lowest depth, sometimes it's highest price, sometimes its enough price to have more score than opponent
 Donotalo: depending on my and opponent score
 miszu: I put a condition that I continue to learn tomes as long as it is &lt;= than my opponent. One opponent had the same logic but he put the condition that if nothing else is left to learn then do potions. My witch keep starting at the empty tomes and try to "learn"
 Donotalo: :grinning:
 Rodrigo_the_coder: improve this challenge code:

 Donotalo: when i first taught my witch to learn, she liked learning so much that she forgot to make potions
 miszu: making potions is overated. The wisdom is priceless
 miszu: 136/2389 in bronze
 miszu: getting there soon
 ZarthaxX: nice
 jrke: what is faster in c++ vector,array,queue?
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 arkwaw: depends on the purpose
 kovi: morning
 jmsether: with a little asm magic you can get any of them optimized
 Kyraleese: Anyone having sporadic "your code didn't read in all the input" on the Fall Challenge?
 ParticleBeam: Somewhere your code is taking too long and timing out?
 Kyraleese: I've debugged and I do indeed read in all the spells/etc and then the two inventories
 Kyraleese: that's a possibility.  Kind of weird though
 LLG: is there any additional rules in Silver?
 LLG: I'm almost out of bronze
 LLG: #1 bronze rn
 ParticleBeam: not that I know of
 Zenoscave: no
 Zenoscave: Only harder opponents
 LLG: I see
 LLG: how does promotion work btw? I'm higher than the boss atm but I'm not promoted
 ClockSort: Bronze has all the rules
 LLG: nvm I'm silver now
 LLG: guess I need to wait for 100% of the battles to complete
 JohnCM: congrats on making silver
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 LLG: what's the most accurate time to start and stop my timer
 LLG: to measure my 50ms window?
 eulerscheZahl: after reading the first line of input
 eulerscheZahl: but there's a server goblin so you should stay below the 50ms
 ParticleBeam: Do you include the time taken to read an input (After the first one)?
 eulerscheZahl: would be good to do. i don't
 eulerscheZahl: usually that makes no difference. just CG having severe problems in this contest
 LLG: I have no idea how your bot generates up to 20k nodes euler...
 LLG: mine's having massive time efficiency problems
 KnightMoves: Yes, my "Fat Search" is finally working
 eulerscheZahl: i'm at 50k to 60k now
 ndosm: anyone please  explain what 'Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur. ' mean?
 eulerscheZahl: and i have a feeling that getting more would help me
 KnightMoves: you should try C++&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: working on it
 eulerscheZahl: usually i convince myself that it's not necessary. but this contest highly rewards a fast engine
 KnightMoves: yeah i think fast code can be a crutch
 KnightMoves: but if you have most of the other problems figured out, especially for a contest like this, then it's certainly helpful
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505788026">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505788026</a>
 JohnCM: yes my first replay under 45 turns!
 LordSkaven: nice
 AshKetchum: srand, rand are producing different results in cg and locally with the same seed. How is this possible?
 eulerscheZahl: i saw one with 26 (but didn't save it&#160;:( )
 JohnCM: i need to cut my number of turns down to 40 to beat silver boss
 KnightMoves: I remember seeing that rand issue in the past when i was working on Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
 eulerscheZahl: which C++ compiler do you use locally? g++?
 JohnCM: AshKetchum, maybe one of the programs is using random without the seed
 eulerscheZahl: if not: mystery solved. i don't think the exact algo is part of the specs
 RobertTakacs: hello :D
 AshKetchum: eulerscheZahl g++.exe gcc version 6.3.0
 AshKetchum: JohnCM, does other bot using rand affect our bot's rand?
 Uljahn: AshKetchum: are you using the same implementation of rand and srand as on CG? could be this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7115459/c-rand-and-srand-gets-different-output-on-different-machines">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7115459/c-rand-and-srand-gets-different-output-on-different-machines</a>
 eulerscheZahl: converted my bot to C++. I get the same sim count as before :sob:
 ParticleBeam: oh. Then I won't bother
 AshKetchum: Uljahn, thank you very much. will try it right now.
 eulerscheZahl: wait. pragmas!
 eulerscheZahl: now we are talking!
 Uljahn: pragmas magic to the rescue, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think the issue is that the other day
 PED: How many sims euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: nodes: 109569    39 ms
 PED: nice
 eulerscheZahl: my arena is at 50-60k
 eulerscheZahl: but i still have to finish the port, enemy prediction&#160;:(
 rohit523: guys what is this simulation and nodes??
 rohit523: can anyone explain in short?
 Earthborne: rohit523 simulate running the game by calculating state from available actions
 Earthborne: nodes are evaluated gamestates
 Earthborne: (right?)
 PED: :thumbsup:
 rohit523: like loops? how many times we are iterating .... i mean total operations in our code?
 rohit523: which inlcude for loops and total constant time statements?
 PED: A gamestate is like&#160;: 'what happens if my next three actions are A, B and C, and my opponent's next three actions are D, E and F'
 lowzhao: may i know for c++ what is the average node count you can see?
 Earthborne: think of states as nodes in a tree and actions as links, you would want to traverse the tree to find a path to your most desired state
 lowzhao: because i feel like it is similar to Python ...
 PED: Eurler is counting how many different futur gamestates (or nodes) he manages to explore in 40ms
 PED: lowzhao in C++ I think most people get around 70k nodes
 PED: How many you get in python?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i count before removing duplicates :D
 eulerscheZahl: and now that i try to print my result i'm segfaulting
 lowzhao: i am only have 2 to 3k removing duplicated ... D:
 Earthborne: ouf, I was getting ~1000 nodes in Python, need to get rid of those classes
 lowzhao: in cpp too
 lowzhao: i think my data structure is crooked
 Earthborne: thilde "~" not working in chat? Didn
 lowzhao: should i use priority queue to do bfs? 
 eulerscheZahl: works perfectly Earthborne <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vlznx1">https://prnt.sc/vlznx1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: except if you use windows i think
 Earthborne: Doesn't it become a beam search then lowzhao?
 Earthborne: Oh, haha 
 Earthborne: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vlzp6d">https://prnt.sc/vlzp6d</a>
 Earthborne: That's how it's looking for me
 PED: @Earthborne, python is expected to be much slower than C++ (at least an order of magntude in most cases). If you want to speed it up try to replace your classes with numpy arrays. Fot instance a spell could be an array (X), and the grimoire could be an ndarray (6,X)
 lowzhao: lol I didnt know what is beam search, but i am thinking some steps takes 2 step to get some takes 3 steps so i should try to explore the closer one before the later one.
 eulerscheZahl: it's still a BFS, just with some filtering. otherwise it would turn into an A*
 Timothee01: hello i'am russian 
 AntonCosmin: hello i'am romanian
 Evedel: hello I'm confused 
 AshKetchum: It worked, thanks Uljahn
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 LordSkaven: I think the search I am using is sort of like beam search, but it could also be just a brute force one. lol
 Earthborne: wow up to 10 ms to compute one gamestate, PED I'm taking your advice, here comes numpy!
 Uljahn: i guess brute force is a base line with no prunning, other search algos are just more or less clever on prunning to be able to return meaningful results given a limited time budget
 LordSkaven: ok then I am not doing brute force, because I do a lot of pruning, not as much as I want to yet tho
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: unless we are not counting the same things, I explore 350-500K nodes per turn in my BFS search
 eulerscheZahl: oh damn
 eulerscheZahl: why are you below me?
 darkhorse64: My potion/spell selection is bad
 darkhorse64: and I have no enemy prediction
 LLG: I haven't put any thought into pruning identical states
 LLG: how do you know if a state is identical?
 eulerscheZahl: rushing the 6th potion will give you a boost if you don't do it already
 LordSkaven: euler that thing you do to see timeouts in an arena run, is that a publicly available tool or something you wrote with the api?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a local python script. the problem is that you have to download each game individually
 eulerscheZahl: if i publish that, we have 100 users downloading all 200 games of their bot
 darkhorse64: Yes, this is one possible improvement
 eulerscheZahl: also ranking is a bit random
 LordSkaven: hmm yeah I see your point
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/505820699">https://www.codingame.com/replay/505820699</a>same bot (i think), 60 ranks difference
 darkhorse64: Actually, going faster make me solve more potions but usually the search is already guiding me towards the right direction. 
 LLG: euler, any pointer on how to remove duplicate states?
 LLG: how do you compare states in a time efficient manner
 eulerscheZahl: use a hashset or the equivalent of your language
 eulerscheZahl: then implement hashcode and equals
 Timothee01: hello i'am north corean 
 eulerscheZahl: what a coincidence, i'm North Bavarian
 SelectNull: i'm just north
 LLG: hashing!!!
 LLG: I completely overlooked it
 Gronahak: My search isn't deep enough to reach dup states :see_no_evil:
 eulerscheZahl: 2 turns are enough for duplicates
 Gronahak: are they&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: get 2 new blue, learn first spelllearn first spell, 2 new blue
 eulerscheZahl: same result
 Gronahak: Oh if you only consider the inventory itself as a state
 eulerscheZahl: inventory + active spells + exhausted spells + remaining orders
 darkhorse64: removing dups only works if your search the path to a potion, not for the best score
 eulerscheZahl: well, i sort by score before expanding further
 eulerscheZahl: then way i only expand the better path
 Gronahak: Unless i'm missing something, in your example the state wouldn't be the same since you learned 2 new spells 
 eulerscheZahl: expand both, keep the better*
 eulerscheZahl: i think you didn't understand my example
 Gronahak: ooooh
 Gronahak: i get it now
 Gronahak: order of actions
 R4YB4T: hi 
 Timothee01: hi rayane my friend
 Diver_Significant: Dude, my high school class is going to love this
 Diver_Significant: Any other teachers out there?
 LordSkaven: I wish I had this when I was learning programming in high school would have helped a lot
 geppoz: eulerscheZahl in state you should also have tome remaining spells, and his rewards
 geppoz: right?
 eulerscheZahl: no geppoz. when i know my own active and exhausted, that's redundant
 eulerscheZahl: C++ submit coming. let's see how this goes
 geppoz: how can you know the reward amount from your active/exh&#160;? you should calculate backtracking learns?
 eulerscheZahl: go deep enough in your search and print the first action of the path leading to the best result? as always?
 geppoz: I mean, in your search tree, in states, you should put the rewards on tome spells (when you learn &gt;0), how can you dont have this in your state?
 struct: Did you finish porting euler?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: missing enemy and endgame strategy
 eulerscheZahl: i don't try to rush the 6th potion
 eulerscheZahl: will probably rank lower than my old. but i see potential in it
 eulerscheZahl: i have a static list for the tome
 eulerscheZahl: and some bits that are set to 1 if i have it as active/exhausted
 geppoz: ok static list for tome recipes, but rewards can change in different branch
 eulerscheZahl: i expand the branch with the highest reward first
 eulerscheZahl: and only keep the first of equal states i find
 Csipcsirip: there isn't any rule between the learn action and the corresponding cast actions ID&#160;? 
 mlemm: i don't think so Csip, but i think you could aswell check the referee code
 struct: its instance id I think
 struct: everytime a spell is learnt it increases that id
 struct: and assign it
 Csipcsirip: oh so no fix ids&#160;?
 struct: Only on tome and recipes 
 Csipcsirip: aight thanks. im gonna need a lookup table then
 mlemm: the tome ingredients themselves can become a key id if you look it up from an other perspective
 mlemm: but that wasn't the question nvm
 dbf: eulerscheZahl how is your c++ submit comparing to c#, less timeouts?
 Csipcsirip: ye i could hash by ingredient values too, but it'd cost more bits than hashing by index
 mlemm: exacly, im actually looking for a go-around solution rn since the index can't be tracked
 Csipcsirip: i think ill just use the the actions position in the actions list
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the c# version had a stupid bug, i fixed the first turn timeouts before
 eulerscheZahl: was around rank 10 afterwards
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm optimistic when i fully port it
 mlemm: please no
 mlemm: please let me updated euler, after you finish porting im dying to know
 eulerscheZahl: you'll see the answer on the leaderboard
 struct: nice now I cant get 1st in C#
 struct: my plan is complete
 mlemm: if the ranking doesn't get slower
 eulerscheZahl: i gave that task to ille
 Donotalo: &lt;sigh&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: "you have to defend the honor of C#"
 Donotalo: you guys write the solution in multiple languages? most people struggle with their favorite language
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl #30 :O
 mlemm: i won't but struct will
 eulerscheZahl: i dropped dbdr :D
 eulerscheZahl: but don't worry, i'll be back
 dbdr: are you rewriting in C++?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: :sweat_smile:about you being back
 eulerscheZahl: not finished yet. my bot doesn't know about the 6 sample = end of game
 dbdr: ah, C++ in arena already
 eulerscheZahl: "sample". i'm still using C4L terminology
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i could go to #10 with c#
 dbdr: lame&#160;;)
 41148: :relaxed:
 eulerscheZahl: but 30 motivates me more to finish the port
 dbdr: indeed, I see why you had to switch
 eulerscheZahl: double sim count now
 Vadasz: How many nodes do you have euler in C++?
 eulerscheZahl: 130k
 eulerscheZahl: still low i guess :D
 struct: not that low
 eulerscheZahl: that is before eliminating duplicates
 struct: how much time?
 eulerscheZahl: 40ms
 mlemm: no timeouts&#160;? are you sure
 DomiKo: 300K is not that hard to get 
 eulerscheZahl: let me check
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your processing of the nodes too. DFS is faster than storing all nodes and sorting
 DomiKo: yes I know
 DomiKo: by 300K I mean normal tree with sorting

 Csipcsirip: tx euler was about to ask for that
 eulerscheZahl: always about 5ms. and then 30
 Nerchio: i used bitset for the first time
 Nerchio: got a bug that took hours to figure out
 Nerchio: can recommend :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: i used C++ for the first time (in a CG contest at least)
 mlemm: Nerchio that's the best way to learn something :sweat_smile:
 Nerchio: euler i wanted to jump to C++ and started rewriting but when i heard my polish java friends getting tons of states in java
 Nerchio: i decided to come back and try
 eulerscheZahl: hmm, i allocate 200k nodes at the start. in 1 turn i already found: 175103
 eulerscheZahl: maybe not a timeout because of CG but be writing outside of the array
 Nerchio: my bot says it does up to 300k nodes in the later turns in java
 Nerchio: is it believable or a bug? :D
 Nerchio: i don't sort or anything like you Euler so its just bfs
 JBence: hey euler, I kind of solved the c# timeouts
 JBence: only had a few on the last submit with 45ms
 struct: Well I was getting 500k states, but I found it was bugged
 RockyMullet: oh I fail some casts thinking I can multi cast wen I cant :thinking:
 Nerchio: how was it bugged struct? :D
 struct: too ashamed to say sorry
 eulerscheZahl: you forgot to update the inventory
 struct: way worse
 struct: its related to packing everything in 1 int
 eulerscheZahl: you packed 2 things in the same place?
 struct: It was so dumb its impossible for anyone to guess
 LordSkaven: you forgot to return the value
 eulerscheZahl: so, when gold?
 mlemm: you bit operated on different byte lenghts&#160;?
 mlemm: something like this
 struct: I was doing a + b
 RockyMullet: haha

 RockyMullet: yah im debugging a case where I output the wrong thing locally, I should figure out my dumbness :P

 karliso: Brutaltester sometimes gives: "Negative score during game 1 p0:-1". It is always p0 and last command/time looks fine. Does anyone know what is going on?
 Nerchio: I had same problems when trying it during different contest
 Nerchio: didn't figure it out really but most of the time it gave me error when using multiple threads
 Nerchio: on 1 thread was working mostly fine
 karliso: I have just one thread.
 karliso: I also observed that silencing cerr helps a lot to avoid timeouts locally.
 Nerchio: yeah maybe you can talk to Magus directly about it
 karliso: But this doesn't look timeout related as time at the end of turn is fine.
 kovi: what happens with cerr on your env?i had -1 when using multi games running at once as my process used errorlog file which was not shared
 karliso: I am running it on windows cmd

 Csipcsirip: eulersc++heZahl
 hasleron: I'm working with C++ and evaluating many states. I'm wondering if it makes sense to replace int values with unsigned char if they never exceed 255. Could that improve the performance? Some answers I found suggest no, but others say less used memory could improve access times due to more values stored in cache. Does anyone know more about this?
 Csipcsirip: in my experience replacing ints with chars doesnt help that much. unles your at the edge of the memory limit
 DomiKo: there are many factors
 poInT: and honestly probably there are other things you can improve before you go into this kind of optimizations&#160;:)
 LordSkaven: ^ definitely, premature optimization is the sudo of evil
 struct: avoid early optimizations
 struct: please
 Vadasz: char vs int: if you have a large vector, it could be a significant difference when you use fill(..) in ms
 hasleron: Yeah there are definitively other major things to improve, I just figured I need state evaluations in any case so why not see how to improve them. But I guess I can run speed tests once the other stuff is done. Thanks y'all
 Uljahn: i think the only right way to find out is to implement both approaches and compare by profiling, at least it's more robust unlike asking for opinions or making predictions on how things "should" work in theory
 struct: Also try to profile with real cases
 Uljahn: ye, it's very easy to fail in profiling
 hasleron: real cases would be using something like the game API? 
 JRFerguson: hi all, is there any brutaltester referee around&#160;?
 karliso: It looks like the referee doesn't recognize my command: "LEARN 34 T.24" which is causing those -1's.

 Nerchio: i started timeouting at the start of my turn in IDe ;x
 Nerchio: this is the problem you were saying euler? xD
 RockyMullet: finally top 100 in silver :confused:
 RockyMullet: im really starting to think I might actually get stuck in silver this time
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vm60u7">https://prnt.sc/vm60u7</a>and of course my first loss is to the worst player. and it's a timeout :D
 RockyMullet: timeouts only happens in games you would've won, that's the rule
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/505986811">https://www.codingame.com/replay/505986811</a>i can't prove it but was looking good for me
 eulerscheZahl: i even finished my search at 41ms. but no output
 Nerchio: =/
 DomiKo: yes 20ms cout is hard&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: lovely timeout&#160;:(
 RockyMullet: me I'm starting to thinkk I have a random crash
 RockyMullet: cause I stop at like 35 ms
 RockyMullet: and still timeout
 eulerscheZahl: often?
 Nerchio: i started getting these timeouts as well
 eulerscheZahl: the question: do you get more timeouts than others?
 RockyMullet: probably 1/5 of my lost
 Csipcsirip: maybe it's some server stuff? I got some random timeouts too
 eulerscheZahl: i did yesterday at that time. and it was my fault
 AllYourMCTS: in other games i've gotten timeouts with no error messages because of an out of memory error
 Nerchio: i didn't have timeouts before since 20 minutes i timeout all the time in the ide
 Nerchio: sometimes at the start of my turn
 ZarthaxX: what the heck??
 Nerchio: limited to 35ms as well even though i can do 45ms xD
 ZarthaxX: java nerchio right mm
 Nerchio: i don't use big objects anymore so my turns last almost exactly how long i want
 Nerchio: so im sure its not my fault
 RockyMullet: oh actually, checked my games, I dont seem to timeout, maybe i just needed to stop my search earlier, also my best submit, so maybe I got lucky too
 Nerchio: i guess i will come back later
 RockyMullet: one thing I fixed was using a couple of gigantic arrays in my base search function, meaning I'd have to destroy those gigantic arrays when I was going out of the function, having an actual cost of ending my sim, therfore having too much things to do AFTER I quit my search
 Nerchio: timing out sometimes before my round even starts is sad
 ZarthaxX: RockyMullet lol, gigantic arrays :rofl:
 RockyMullet: yeah I dont want to deal with reallocating problems
 RockyMullet: so I just waste that memory :P
 ZarthaxX: just preserve the poor arrays mah man
 RockyMullet: yah my fix was exactly that
 ZarthaxX: gud carne
 AntiSquid: hard silver wtf lol
 ZarthaxX: go for the gold, do it for me
 AntiSquid: ok ZarthaxX
 RockyMullet: AntiSquid yeah I'm not sure if it's just because it's a game I suck at or if it's harder than usual
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid wasn'tfor you, but now that you say it, thanks
 AntiSquid: feels much harder than usual :D
 AntiSquid: OOC level
 ZarthaxX: maybe because there is no much clear room for easy improvement?
 struct: Just wait until legend new rules
 RockyMullet: yeah ZarthaxX, no much room for some cheesy improvement
 AntiSquid: stronger bots early on
 Nerchio: exit search at 35 ms -&gt; timeout :joy: thanks CG
 AntiSquid: i just do 10k nodes atm, no sorting no time check
 RockyMullet: I feel because there is a lot of participant and contests are less often, maybe there's just more tryhard people than usual
 AntiSquid: and with this much i'd expect gold :P
 AllYourMCTS: id say the game is on the less complex side too
 AllYourMCTS: perfect information aside from random deck, mainly solitaire
 lowzhao: for cpp is itpossible that error is not catched&#160;? because i cannot see the error but it was shown as timeout.
 Westicles: Any indication what is behind the timeouts?
 eulerscheZahl: the server goblin
 struct: zombie processes
 RockyMullet: AllYourMCTS exactly, making really hard to have counter/tactic, you just gotta pump up those numbers, there's an obvious solution
 RockyMullet: there's pretty much one solution: look the deeper you can
 RockyMullet: so im pretty sure every silver and above already have a depth N sim and is just trying to go deeper and deeper
 AntiSquid: damn stuck at around 350 Q_Q gtg hope to improve later
 ErikBrendel: silver rank 200 here, not doing any simulations
 wlesavo: deeper not exactly the answer you looking for because of randomness and quite short games
 RockyMullet: ErikBrendel oh well, you giving me hope I guess
 ZarthaxX: ErikBrendel noice :O
 RockyMullet: wlesavo yeah you can add enemy prediction and/or statistics on top of that
 RockyMullet: if I'm really desperate and not bored yet, I might try to check for a depth 3 enemy prediction
 RockyMullet: rn I only check depth 1 if enemy can do a potion on this turn, that's pretty much  the only enemy prediction I do
 ZarthaxX: that's amazing
 ZarthaxX: and do you do with that info? :P
 Westicles: What if you launched your code with processbuilder, then you kill the process if it goes rogue and do a move
 ZarthaxX: i mean, he is going to get it next turn, can you get it?
 RockyMullet: if it's its last potion, I try to full my inventory with tier1+
 RockyMullet: I do steal some victories here and there with it
 wlesavo: RockyMullet well yes but depth&gt;10 seems to be not very helpful, at least from my perspective
 RockyMullet: true
 RockyMullet: personally I feel my bot has way too many turns where he doesnt have a clear potion in mind
 RockyMullet: when it's slow and only reach depth 3
 JBence: poor pb got stuck with a max value inventory
 JBence: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/506007745">https://www.codingame.com/replay/506007745</a>
 RockyMullet: so I feel, depth 5 is probably good enough
 JohnCM: this is an search pruning challenge
 Csipcsirip: so he too hash invertoryvalue in the eval
 Csipcsirip: has*
 JohnCM: the one who uses least compute can search deeper
 ErikBrendel: JBence wow that is a really unfortunate situation :D
 JohnCM: meanwhile, i'm still debugging my bfs:RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
 JBence: Csipcsirip, just got blocked by losing that potion
 RockyMullet: maybe I could try to make so kind of tree between my spells, to know which one can influence which, so I can ignore those that cant influence one another
 eulerscheZahl: getting stuck happens from time to time, some bots even detect it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/itigo_purokonn/status/1328668659686916097/photo/1">https://twitter.com/itigo_purokonn/status/1328668659686916097/photo/1</a>
 CommanderCero: ive tried to do an interaction tree between spells to compute how fast i can produce certain resources
 CommanderCero: that wasnt fun or worth it
 Csipcsirip: ye JBence but after that he still fills the inventory with the highest value inregidens possible
 Csipcsirip: oh actually no
 JBence: that potion was his only way out
 LordSkaven: I also have a potion that is my only way out, very pretty potion except for the skull on the bottle and the warning sticker
 Csipcsirip: ye, youre right
 JBence: I wasn't trying to be mean by taking it though
 RockyMullet: CommanderCero ok thanks for the tip
 RockyMullet: well my next step is probably just some profiling then, gotta fast(er)
 RockyMullet: gotta go fast
 CommanderCero: I mean my problem was that I couldnt find a reasonable definition for "fast". I think influence may be easier to detect
 CommanderCero: but even then you can probably ignore such an optimization
 CommanderCero: if you can go deep enough, which is quite possible in this competition
 struct: Anyone knows the stack size?
 RockyMullet: CommanderCero yeah deeper mean more information, more information means better decision
 ZarthaxX: not always
 struct: Yeah, on multiplayers it can hurt
 CommanderCero: why do you need so much stack
 struct: I only asked what was the stack size
 RockyMullet: ZarthaxX if you are doing worse with more information, it means your missusing that info
 LordSkaven: if you need to ask then you are using too much struct
 struct: Sure
 Uljahn: struct: you mean for recursion?
 ZarthaxX: RockyMullet i mean, you can always choose a final state as your target which gets worse at deeper turns
 ZarthaxX: it doesnt guarantee it will be better to go deeper, you can miss smth
 Westicles: ulimit -s says 8192
 Zanoshky: Hello, 
 CommanderCero: options manual
 Zanoshky: I only see players not options
 Astrobytes: Settings -&gt; Expert on the left
 Zanoshky: thank you!
 Astrobytes: np
 Scarfield: struct, maybe you can allocate an array on the stack, keep increasing its size until you timeout?
 CommanderCero: i mean for that he needs to use recursion
 CommanderCero: which doesnt represent the exact stack size
 ZarthaxX: you dont need recursion for that
 Astrobytes: Westicles got it with ulimit -s already
 ZarthaxX: on this server?
 ZarthaxX: or locally
 Astrobytes: I would assume here
 ZarthaxX: hi astrobyto btw
 Astrobytes: hiya Zartho, all good?
 Westicles: yeah, from the bash window
 Scarfield: astrobytes
 Astrobytes: scarfield
 ZarthaxX: all gucci mah man
 Scarfield: lol, was stalking you on the leaderboard, failed
 ZarthaxX: you?
 Astrobytes: cool. Yeah, same old crap different day :D
 Astrobytes: lol Scarfield :D
 Scarfield: xD
 miszu: I like when vs some people, we spend like 42 moves to learn all the spells in the book
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Astrobytes: don't bother looking me up anyway Scarfield. I keep trying to write a real bot and keep getting distracted 
 LLG: I hit a wall since getting to silver lol
 LLG: my first commit got to ~600
 LLG: then any 'improvements' I committed tanked my rankings further and further
 Scarfield: also going the bfs way, or other approach?
 LLG: yeah bfs pretty much
 LLG: my search algorithm as a whole hasn't changed much
 LLG: just bfs with some sort of beam search
 Uljahn: LLG: you must improve faster than others to stay at the same place :smiley:
 LLG: but instead of getting the best n results, I get the local maxima of every node
 LLG: I think my bot is legit getting worse tho xD
 CommanderCero: yeah thats beam search
 LLG: most of my changes has been in the evaluation of game states
 LLG: and adjusting a few variables, like starting from which potion should I just rush the easiest one 
 LLG: I tried rushing the last 1, then rushing the last 3 etc.
 CommanderCero: have you tried aproximating how close you are to finishing a potion
 CommanderCero: something continious to guide the search
 LLG: yeah I think that's where my problem is
 LLG: my bot is supposed to calculate the distance between my inventory state and the 'best potion' on the board
 LLG: but in some cases it just hoards yellow ingredients
 LLG: also I think there's something horribly wrong in how I generate game states, because I'm timing out at like 2-3k states
 CommanderCero: hmm thats not much, i think thats a problem
 BrunoFelthes: @LLG I do between 5k~10k states... and i am gold... heuristics is important when you have low number of simulations...
 LLG: what are you looking at when evaluating a game state?
 LLG: I think that's where my biggest problem is right now
 CommanderCero: also if you approximate the distance and it starts hoarting resources, is there maybe an error in the heuristic/search?
 LLG: to be honest I still have no idea how that problem occurred 
 LLG: a coworker of mine encountered the same problem; I've also fought some bots with the same problem
 LLG: when I tried to debug it, my evaluation is going down, but somehow my bot keeps going that direction
 ChristianHaeger: what happens if both witches starts completing the same order?
 geppoz: both successfull
 ChristianHaeger: aha ok, thanks
 geppoz: also if both learn same spell
 Xwtek: About cgx, what are the allowed numbers? And is there any escape symbol for string of characters?
 geppoz: so a game can be literally mirroring and tie
 andrefpoliveira: yap
 ErikBrendel: yes, I actually witnessed this in lower bronce
 Xwtek: Does the number allow fraction or negative number?
 JohnCM: gg.. i do depth 3 bfs and it timed out
 Xwtek: What language did you use?
 JohnCM: python3
 geppoz: I abandoned python
 geppoz: newboards=[]
 geppoz: timed out
 Xwtek: Can you show you Code?
 geppoz: :D garbage collector 50ms
 JohnCM: it's rather long
 JohnCM: basically it is just bfs of all possible actions
 JohnCM: was working fine in my ide
 JohnCM: but once i submitted it, there seems to be a timeout error quite often
 Xwtek: What challenge it is?
 JohnCM: fall challenge?
 JohnCM: the potion one
 Astrobytes: Xwtek:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 SirLoxley: I am having a hard time finding a situation where repeating a spell is a useful action ... I usually don't have that much inventory
 Nerchio: its used quite often for sure
 JohnCM: repeating spell = save 1 move
 JohnCM: or 2 moves
 JohnCM: very impt
 ScifiSpirit: I hate getting suck with full inventory and being unable to brew anything :stuck_out_tongue:
 SirLoxley: you have to build that much inventory first ... as said I normally don't have that much in stock
 ScifiSpirit: stuck*
 LordSkaven: that moment when your unoptimized and feature lacking bot from 2 days ago does better than your current one
 geppoz: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 geppoz: :D
 RicksMLC: I've had that moment for two days now&#160;:)
 AshKetchum: me too
 RicksMLC: Refactor #4 is working now... *phew*
 RicksMLC: but still in bronze - maybe some progress tomorrow
 geppoz: which is the average learnt spells in top smart matches?
 ScifiSpirit: I wonder if i shouldn't actually try to cast ingredients of any specific potions, but to build a balanced inventory so i don't get stuck.
 ScifiSpirit: my bot seems to get stuck all the friggin time now
 ScifiSpirit: darn inventory limit :P
 Westicles: Interesting that #1 and #2 haven't played each other for over 300 games, but they play some others over and over
 Westicles: I guess that tells you who is submitting?
 ScifiSpirit: yep
 ScifiSpirit: that probably means they aren't submitting
 ScifiSpirit: but others are, so they are testing against them
 AshKetchum: how to see wood1 statement if we are already in bronze for those practice games which don't have src given?
 ScifiSpirit: i guess no other choice but to create an alt account?
 miszu: 61th in bronze. Argh... getting closer
 miszu: I notice a pattern. My witch is going for a potion. Once she can brew it she look at another potion recipee and go for it instead...
 ScifiSpirit: :D
 ScifiSpirit: The Indecisive Bot&#160;;)
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: it's you&#160;!
 Automaton2000: yeah, it was a lot of it
 miszu: my logic is like: find best potion based on what is my inventory and then chose best spell to reach that potion
 miszu: I guess my best potion heuristic needs some tweaking so that if you can brew something, then brew it!!
 miszu: and not: my my... look at that other potion...
 ScifiSpirit: all you need to do is check first if you can brew the potions. Then proceed to your usual logic.
 ScifiSpirit: sounds like a great logic otherwise
 miszu: problem is: what if you go for a good potion but by accident you can brew something else which is way worse?
 ScifiSpirit: i would prefer to use this logic for my bot though: "use commands which make me win". But that is not so easy to program :P
 ScifiSpirit: yeah, that is one problem&#160;:)
 yhyoxx: then dont give ur program that option stick to ur target
 miszu: main{win();}
 ScifiSpirit: heh
 ScifiSpirit: you could filter out the really crappy potions you don't want first
 yhyoxx:&#160;;()
 ScifiSpirit: but even a bad potion is good if your inventory is full and you can't brew anything else and can't cast either
 ScifiSpirit: if that is possible
 miszu: mmm... I just realized I don't keep track of how much effort I actually did
 Nerchio: my logic is&#160;: if i dont timeout i consider myself a winner
 ScifiSpirit: :D
 miszu: effort = current spent + how much left. Mine is just how much left
 ScifiSpirit: yeah
 miszu: so I need to track the current spent and it show solve the undecisivness problem
 miszu: should*
 ScifiSpirit: i did consider to valuate the potions according to "turns to brew", but i haven't gotten basic problems sorted out yet, so no point going fancy yet
 ScifiSpirit: i underestimated the complexity of this game
 miszu: turns to brew is a very important one
 miszu: if you do it right, like you write an optimistic heuristic it could be very good one
 ScifiSpirit: as usual, i probably won't get anywhere in the allotted time&#160;:( And then i have to wait for months again before i can play this.
 Nerchio: well you can play multis outside of competitions as well
 Nerchio: its fun
 ScifiSpirit: yeah, but if i want to continue this one after the competition ends
 ScifiSpirit: as i often do, because 11 days is nowhere enough for me :P
 Counterbalance: it'll probably be available as a multi in a week or so
 Astrobytes: It'll be available in 1-2 days after it ends
 Astrobytes: (according to CG)
 RockyMullet: I'v been drifting, from 100th to 60th
 eulerscheZahl: but when will the next contest be?
 RockyMullet: maybe I can just... wait :P
 eulerscheZahl: wait for lucky legend push?
 ScifiSpirit: oh, just few days? That's a lot quicker compared to how it used to be.
 RockyMullet: lucky gold push :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are in silver?
 eulerscheZahl: i lost you and didn't even notice. i'm sorry&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: yeah ScifiSpirit, and your bot gets auto-pushed to the multi too
 yhyoxx: how many nodes do u do per turn&#160;?
 ScifiSpirit: ok, that works, unless the rules change
 eulerscheZahl: who @yhyoxx?
 yhyoxx: u or anyone&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i can offer 125k-175, depends on the server i get
 wlesavo:  wow didnt noticed euler rewrited in c++ 
 eulerscheZahl: for the speed boost
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sorry
 yhyoxx: nice
 eulerscheZahl: but for you python wasn'T good enough either wlesavo
 wlesavo: did you get rid of your timeouts?
 yhyoxx: i cant even do 5000
 eulerscheZahl: had many first turn timeouts caused by my bot
 eulerscheZahl: predict opponent (6 turns)
 wlesavo: euler well you can blame me for that :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: then simulate myself for hte rest
 wlesavo: cant!
 eulerscheZahl: well, opponent sometimes took to long in the first turn
 wlesavo: i see
 eulerscheZahl: this is a CPU contest. i totally understand that you decided against python
 wlesavo: i have some simple mc for the opp, but my initial learning is still very bad
 eulerscheZahl: i see some in gold but would be really impressed if they can reach legend that way
 eulerscheZahl: i did a bit of offline testing with more time
 eulerscheZahl: online: 38 turns to reach a score of 100
 eulerscheZahl: offline: 25 turns for a score of 97
 eulerscheZahl: so i would still like to get some more sims
 yhyoxx: woah
 eulerscheZahl: (not from the start, at some state in the middle)
 yhyoxx: not bad 
 LLG: idk what went wrong with my duplicate detection
 LLG: I had to rewrite GetHashCode and Equals for my classes, but somehow it still doesn't detect any dupes
 wlesavo: btw euler how many sims you got from rewrite?
 eulerscheZahl: before i was sneaking around 50k
 eulerscheZahl: so well worth it
 wlesavo: almost x2?
 struct: seems closer to 3
 eulerscheZahl: 2.5-3x now
 kovi: but you cant get that high score without opponent interaction
 wlesavo: oh right
 eulerscheZahl: also a bit of refactoring, not a 1:1 port
 Csipcsirip: u're still singleplayer euler&#160;?
 kovi: this is a low interaction game, but not for 20+ turns
 eulerscheZahl: no, i consider teh opponent
 ScifiSpirit: It's pretty sad how i can seemingly easily beat bronze boss, but can't beat other bronze players. Are we all keeping each other stuck in bronze?
 eulerscheZahl: of course i can't plan for 20 turns without interference
 eulerscheZahl: but maybe i still find some better orders to cast spells or what to learn
 kovi: but if you sim opponent for 6turns
 eulerscheZahl: 7
 kovi: for next 10+ turn this may have influence but not longer
 eulerscheZahl: then i can guess for which i'm competing
 geppoz: also I think going too deep is not so much useful since, at first LEARN of either player, the condition change in unpredictable state (new tome unknown)
 k7n: beginner question: i'm hanging around 12k nodes with a 49 ms bfs. I'm still using a deque and a node struct with a child vector. What do you do to optimise? Put the whole state in a 2D array and move the deque to an array?
 andrefpoliveira: C++. Is better vector or list? To store ints
 eulerscheZahl: when i have no clue what i should learn, depth can help
 Westicles: vector
 eulerscheZahl: not for the final BREW but to know how well the spells fit together
 andrefpoliveira: Ok ty!
 ScifiSpirit: andrefpoliveira, content matters less than what you do with the container
 Counterbalance: if you're going for speed don't use the STL
 Astrobytes: as long as you allocate the size and don't change it vector is fine
 Ramdeath: eulerschezahl for learn you use sim?
 Counterbalance: it's still a lot slower
 eulerscheZahl: static vector to store all spells = bad idea?
 eulerscheZahl: of course Ramdeath
 geppoz: I'm just sayng that, after 2 or 3 LEARN, the real board has 2 or 3 new spells in tome, so you can imagine to LEARN a nice spell, when in real a nicer one would appear
 eulerscheZahl: i still have a heuristic in my scoring that encourages to learn
 geppoz: ofc, since it is not possible to predict, we can only go depper
 eulerscheZahl: but the sim can also find some cool LEANRs
 eulerscheZahl: my favorite replay for learn: frame 16 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/503480087">https://www.codingame.com/replay/503480087</a>
 eulerscheZahl: learn complete nonsense, get free spot in inventory and use for other spells
 andrefpoliveira: Nice
 geppoz: nice, learn just for pay tax :D
 mlemm: the governement is proud of your sim euler
 mlemm: tax++
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 DomiKo: Euler are you simulating 7 enemy turn without yourself? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 DomiKo: thx
 DomiKo: that tax was epic
 Ramdeath: i use vectors, try sim and 4k took 20 ms... depth 5
 BrunoFelthes: what kind of search are you using euler?
 eulerscheZahl: the beamy kind
 DomiKo: It's so funny when my bot goes from 50 to 37
 Zhmyh: How can you guys handle up to 170k vertices. I mean I think the vertex traversal algorithm is pretty common (like bfs). But I can only handle up to 30k vertices in 30 ms.
 LLG: idk why I'm timing out after only a few thousand nodes
 eulerscheZahl: the trick is to use 40ms
 LLG: is deep cloning a State time consuming?
 DomiKo: Zhmyh you need to opti you solution
 CommanderCero: Zhmyh do not allocate a lot of memory
 DomiKo: make every action in O(1)
 Zhmyh: and I'm trying to squeeze out all the performance
 DomiKo: and you will be happy
 Zhmyh: I don't use heap allocations almost at all
 Nerchio: LLG yes probably the most time consuming out of all :P
 Zhmyh: All my vectors are static
 LLG: but I do need to deep clone the entire state right?
 yhyoxx: vector&lt;Action&gt; go brr
 Nerchio: well it depends :S
 DomiKo: deep clone could be realy fast
 DomiKo: if you have good representation of GameState
 CommanderCero: also for example if you use beam-search, aka bfs where you filter
 CommanderCero: do not use sort
 CommanderCero: but use an heap
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 DomiKo: why?
 CommanderCero: with an min-heap you can easily see which state has the lowest score
 eulerscheZahl: i only sort once. and have a fast add in return
 DomiKo: once in turn?
 eulerscheZahl: once per depth
 DomiKo: ufff
 CommanderCero: yeah exactly after i removed that my code got much faster
 CommanderCero: reason is pushing to the vector is expensive
 CommanderCero: as well as sort
 ZarthaxX: well, dont use a vector :P
 ZarthaxX: plain array
 kovi: but then its m * logm instead of nlogn
 DomiKo: sort is O(n log n) bro
 reCurse: As always with all these sorts of claims... use a profiler
 kovi: (instead m * logn i meant)
 reCurse: In the 50ms realm the theory doesn't always hold
 CommanderCero: yeah but you avoid the memory allocation, by using an heap i have 2 vectors with size=PruneSizeinstead of constantly creating a new one
 CommanderCero: but yeah could certainly be only for me, but it doubled my depth. On the other hand I do not have an high rank as the toad
 Zhmyh: consider creating your custom vector with fixed capacity based on std::array. pretty comfortable and no heap allocations
 reCurse: If by based you mean derivated it's a bad idea.
 Zhmyh: why derivated
 reCurse: Just clarifying
 Zhmyh: U can have an std::array member in it.
 Zhmyh: Or just raw array
 reCurse: Sure, it wasn't clear which version you meant
 Zhmyh: But I think derive will do either
 LLG: my state cloning takes like 10k+ ticks
 reCurse: Derive is a bad idea because it will mess up with size and others
 LLG: I think I should really find a way to clone faster
 Zhmyh: LLG memcpy
 Zhmyh: reCurce std::array has only size
 reCurse: Don't use memcpy unless you absolutely know what you're doing
 Zhmyh: yeah
 LLG: I'm on c# btw
 reCurse: size, begin, end, and all friends
 reCurse: That's why don't derivate
 LLG: I guess I could try to serialize my obj
 Zhmyh: Well, maybe. I'm not sure here
 LLG: a generic deep clone using serialize is much slower than just creating new objects lol
 k7n: wow, i removed the deque for a array and went to +100k from 12k nodes
 ZarthaxX: :O pog
 andrefpoliveira: k7n what language?
 k7n: c++
 andrefpoliveira: Nice then I know what to use xD
 Zhmyh: k7n is it on local or on server?
 Nerchio: maybe deque was resizing all the time
 k7n: server
 Zhmyh: :tired_face: me with 30k
 Zhmyh: and no allocations
 CommanderCero: what do you mean with static arrays zhmyh
 k7n: but something is off, time to investigate
 Zhmyh: CommanderCero just raw array
 Zhmyh: like int[5]
 Zhmyh: no new
 CommanderCero: but how do you search then
 Zhmyh: no malloc
 Zhmyh: I calculated all the limit sizes
 Zhmyh: And each such array has this size
 mlemm: must be way inefficient isn't
 Zhmyh: And my structure, which contains all this nodes only constructs in the beggining
 Zhmyh: Every move I simply reuse it
 CommanderCero: im not sure what you mean with limit sizes, i mean the amount of states is probably quite big
 Zhmyh: 30k in my case
 CommanderCero: yeah but thats the amount of states visited after searching
 CommanderCero: im wondering where you store the states during search
 Zhmyh: By pointer
 Zhmyh: To this big array
 Zhmyh: Hm... Is it ok for performance to have 10-15k bytes on stack?
 CommanderCero: I have no clue xD
 Zhmyh: :tired_face: going back to the profiler
 reCurse: 10-15kb should be fine
 Cappefra: does anyone else get random "unhandled exception"s in C# without any explanation or reference to the code?
 LLG: I do have to clone all the actions to generate another state right?
 LLG: because right now it's the most time consuming operation for me
 LLG: but idk if I could cut down on it
 miszu: so vs bronze bot. I won 10 times and lost 4 times. Is that benchmark enough to be confident to beat the boss in arena?
 Conorach: it's good
 CoolGlitch: what does OPPONENT_CAST mean?
 arkwaw: CAST that is available for your opponent
 Astrobytes: it's spells your opponent has cast
 geppoz: *can
 Astrobytes: *can
 Astrobytes: lol
 arkwaw: *can

 Astrobytes: I just know without clicking that's the Can-Can
 geppoz: seems we share thoughts man :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 miszu: finished 8th in bronze
 miszu: so frustrating
 miszu: 3rd now&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Wait &amp; see
 Astrobytes: might get pushed up
 miszu: yeah but arena battle is over now
 Westicles: Keep adding learn 0s at the front until you pass
 miszu: aaand 1st
 miszu: lost vs people who got promoted to silver
 dreadylein: grats&#160;:)
 ClockSort: seems like you'll be silver really soon
 ClockSort: it can't be immediate, otherwise there would be nobody in first bronze&#160;:)
 mlemm: wp miszru
 mlemm: anybody know when does legend bracket opens up&#160;?
 JBM: typically friday evening
 JBM: as it says when you click on your league
 NitMpez: well... i atleast pushed someone over the boss
 ZarthaxX: feels good
 thibpat: Hi folks! I'm streaming the Fall Challenge in JS on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>, feel free to come say hello :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: i can say hello here. Hi
 kami:&#160;;)
 mlemm: :joy:
 NitMpez: yeap, hi
 Westicles: I love the ones where they sit silently and type and the screen is blurry and sometimes they make snorting sounds
 NitMpez: crossing fingers that last 33% pushes me over silver boss
 Astrobytes: lol, thibpat does good streams fortunately
 NitMpez: man i struggled with silver... i'm dreading gold
 Astrobytes: "...and sometimes they make snorting sounds" - so true Westicles :rofl:
 NitMpez: well bah... stuck in silver longer
 eulerscheZahl: "...and sometimes they make snorting sounds"that would totally be me if i was streaming :D
 JBM: would watch
 Astrobytes: But you have a pleasing accent euler
 eulerscheZahl: me: "can you hear me"smits: "i hear someone speaking English with a german accept"me:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, the trollage
 eulerscheZahl: he was muted all the time, didn't want to wake up his daughter
 Astrobytes: Gotta get your own back at some point then
 Icebox: that's so true tho eulerscheZahl
 Zahra.Alipour: where are you from guys?&#160;:)
 Icebox: your accent is so german :D
 eulerscheZahl: i know&#160;:(
 struct: Got finally to silver
 struct: Now I have 4 days for gold
 Icebox: which isn't a bad thing :D
 eulerscheZahl: but i won't do calls with MadKnight to improve it
 Astrobytes: grats struct :tada:
 struct: ty
 miszu: lol struct beat me in 2 sec
 Astrobytes: Zahra.Alipour hover over our profile pics to see our locations&#160;;)
 struct: What do you mean miszu?
 eulerscheZahl: miszu promoted right after?
 struct: Ok now im more motivated
 miszu: struct, you were in bronze or at least someone with your name. You were above the bronze bot and  got promoted
 miszu: I am still in bronze
 Astrobytes: don't resubmit miszu, you're close enough to be pushed up right now
 miszu: as 1st
 Zahra.Alipour: thankss&#160;:))
 miszu: yeah I am not resubmitting
 NitMpez: yeah i was above silver boss then horrible string of losses right at end to drop below
 struct: Yeah, I think I fought you and miszu quite a bit
 NitMpez: i need someone to stomp on silver boss and be nice to me
 miszu: what's annoying is I never fought the bronze bot in the arena.
 miszu: yet I can win 10/14 in the ide
 Zahra.Alipour: what a beautiful prof&#160;:))
 struct: 6505 players
 Astrobytes: very impressive
 miszu: where?
 eulerscheZahl: this contest
 Astrobytes: this contest
 Astrobytes: damnit :D
 miszu: I see 17k registered
 eulerscheZahl: filter by score:all
 Nerchio: so do i simulate the enemy or not? ;d
 miszu: ok I see
 miszu: lots of people didn't submit anything
 NitMpez: so close .03 away from boss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :baby_bottle:
 miszu: I know the next step is to write simulations but I am too lazy to write the game engine
 miszu: teadious part of an AI
 Zahra.Alipour: dose anyone solves problem E today in cf?
 miszu: .4 difference to the bronze bot
 eulerscheZahl: we have our own contest running right now. probably not many players here who did codeforces
 AshKetchum: miszu, basic simulation for this game is a bit easier than previous contests
 miszu: yeah but I don't have lots of free time to invest in that. Techincally I should be working but at work it is a bit dead
 Zahra.Alipour: how can i reply here
 struct: Zahra.Alipour type the name
 Zahra.Alipour: oww hard
 AshKetchum: type first few letters and press tab, it fills the name
 AshKetchum: try ash "tab"
 Zahra.Alipour: aw ok
 Jdools05: Hey world, I've decided to totally redo my bot for the Fall Comp... 200 lines in and many more to go. Im trying to future proof it
 miszu: I wish I know how to use the unit test framework in visual studio so I could test my game engine if I decide to do it
 struct: miszu im sure there are tutorials on it
 Westicles: I wonder if someone is going to pop up with solutions that involve crazy math.  Big matrix solutions or something
 miszu: oh for sure. It's just the time comitment for it.
 miszu: neural network
 Westicles: Or are the top players pretty much finding optimal paths anyhow?
 Jdools05: Westicles, Im trying to find a percentage of fit for spells to target potions.
 miszu: GUYS! only .05 diff with the boss bot
 miszu: .03 now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: game paths beyond 2 brews become really fuzzy, is running all the probabilities beyond that point really worth it?  I mean you would have to be top 5 er something
 Zenoscave: Patrick I can get apath with 5 items but My scoring between paths is wonky
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I thought rating the learnable by cost to benefit ratio would be fun.  but then I see top bots finding seemingly illogical combinations that are just way powerful
 Zenoscave: Abandoned that attempt
 miszu: I am above the boss now
 NitMpez: gratz
 miszu: SILVER!
 miszu: hahahah finally
 miszu: I can die in peace
 ZarthaxX: gz!
 Astrobytes: gz miszu
 Jdools05: miszu, you will be able to rest for a few minutes and then the drive to move higher will return
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My learnables aren't in my tree, I'm rewriting... it's pretty necessary to optimize learns for gold
 Zenoscave: Learning mid game? Is that done now?
 malcoriel: what's going on with silver? Boss has no rank?
 NitMpez: i'm struggling making performance increases... get around a depth of 5 to 6 in 50ms running 130+k sim turns
 NitMpez: bosses never have a rank
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/506220666">https://www.codingame.com/replay/506220666</a>
 struct: My bot likes tier 0
 NitMpez: just road blocks between leagues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i grab the potentially good spells within the first 16 turns, but I'm not finding the killer combos that the top bots r using
 NitMpez: my bot likes losing :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i had a game where the 0 position spell had 20 ingredients on it as tax
 ZarthaxX: the f :rofl:
 RockyMullet: hum, after some profiling, I spend 13% of my sim time on just copying game states
 RockyMullet: seems like a lot
 ZarthaxX: bad carne
 ZarthaxX: you gotta meat up your game carne
 RockyMullet: and 39% of the sim just checking what are the valid next moves
 RockyMullet: so I didnt improve anything during my lunch break, but at least I know why my bot sucks lol
 Astrobytes: if Rocky looks towards the sunset in an evening, does that make him Carne West? :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: wat
 miszu: thanks Astrobytes and Jdools05. But for getting to gold, I need to write the simulation now. I need to work out and do "socializing"
 <b>**RockyMullet is impressed by Astrobytes's pun</b></p><p><img src="/a/29443769474274" /> MadKnight: because that's not how u improve your accent eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: Or, "the engines carne take it captain" in reference to your sim RockyMullet
 Jdools05: miszu, I wish you the best! good luck!
 eulerscheZahl: the more relevant question: how do i improve my bot?
 RockyMullet: I profiled my sim and the results are in: it's carnage
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 MadKnight: fancy enemy predictions&#160;?
 TIKCUS: lol
 miszu: eulerscheZahl, because the game is new it would be good to study the domain of the game and see what would consider a good move or not.
 kovi: copy closet draws?
 Q12: &gt; MadKnightjump to his home and check what his doing :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 MadKnight: where is a bot's home Q12&#160;?
 MadKnight: is it inside server's memory&#160;?
 TIKCUS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ghost-legs">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ghost-legs</a>
 Q12: yeah, I believe in you! you can do it :stuck_out_tongue:
 TIKCUS: can anyone help me to solve this 
 Westicles: Offline search, find casts that tend to go together so you can group them
 41148: what is Offline search?
 eulerscheZahl: that's something i've thought about but totally don't want to do Westicles&#160;:(
 TIKCUS:&#160;:(
 NitMpez: same
 eulerscheZahl: would be locam all over again
 PatrickMcGinnisII: TIKCUS just setup a linkmap and then loop from left to right top to bottom, pretty easy
 sirsatan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/506228116">https://www.codingame.com/replay/506228116</a>
 miszu: eulerscheZahl, do you simulate your opponent as well?
 sirsatan: isnt 1st tome free&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 sirsatan: or some bug
 struct: 1st index of tome
 struct: not first learn
 eulerscheZahl: 7 turns ahead fo the opponent
 miszu: does it help a lot to simulate opponent?
 eulerscheZahl: so i know when the game will end
 TIKCUS: PatrickMcGinnisII hmmm ok thanks i misunderetood the limit
 eulerscheZahl: not a lot but helps
 struct: Similar to STC help?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe 5-10 ranks
 TIKCUS: 41148
 TIKCUS: hi gol
 eulerscheZahl: for stc i am 4th without opponent sim, so...
 41148: TIKCUS  salam :upside_down:
 miszu: lots of work invovled 
 struct: Well if there were this many players on STC, it could matter there too
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure if i want to keep playing this game&#160;:(
 miszu: my bronze code can beat 18 silver ppls
 struct: cmon euler, too late to quit
 struct: Just rest 1 day or something
 darkhorse64: You'll be the Gold boss
 struct: now he wont play for sure
 eulerscheZahl: tomorrow afternoon i'll do some math tutoring. i'm bad at saying no
 JBM: on twitch? 
 miszu: what math you tutor?
 eulerscheZahl: "tan, cos and that other thing"
 eulerscheZahl: in person, no stream
 TIKCUS: do you really prefer here to interesthing game
 Icebox: cool :o
 Icebox: do you know coronaschool eulerscheZahl?
 aStar: hi all
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that's where she has an exam on tuesday
 aStar: :3 anyone used A* for searching?
 ZarthaxX: so its a *she* heh
 eulerscheZahl: so to the last-minute rescue
 ZarthaxX: too humble
 JBM: yeah I've used you a few times
 aStar: i just used depth-limited search for creating game tree
 aStar: i can't find good heuristics to apply for A* :3
 dbf: aStar, what's about witch.score?&#160;:)
 aStar: i just calculate the path score of the game tree by using Price of receipts
 aStar: and then a choose best path to move 
 aStar: the idea is "make a game tree with all possible path, and choice best path to move" :3
 miszu: when you code in c++ with a java mentality. I get caught with the copy constructor thinking I am just copying the pointer like in java
 eulerscheZahl: my c++ looks like c89 standard
 struct: lol
 dbf: lol, I call it 'c with classes'
 eulerscheZahl: i started this contest with really clean, structured code
 miszu: I just find it disapointing there are less jobs for C++. Mostly because not many developers in c++ and also the high maintenance cost
 eulerscheZahl: how can it get that bad in a single week?
 dbf: I have structured code only when I'm reading stdin
 eulerscheZahl: because that's the default template
 DomiKo: how can it get that bad in a single day, that's a question
 dbf: that's my polished template to put stdin into my objects&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: right, i started c++ yesterday
 miszu: you need to up your coding standard :D
 eulerscheZahl: i need more global arrays
 DomiKo: when I look at my code I think that's UTTT
 eulerscheZahl: at which sector of my code am i allowed to add something?
 dbf: somewhere in Utils.h
 Donotalo: what's UTTT?
 struct: ultimate tic tac toe
 BrunoFelthes: what local tester is working with this referee? cg-brutal tester is working?
 wlesavo: dbdr keep that version to push me to the legend plz :slight_smile:
 dbdr: ok&#160;:)
 wlesavo: and dont go to the legend before that :slight_smile:
 dbdr: well, this version won't
 Anonymoussssss: yah
 Skynse: I went to take a bath right after joining a clash, when I came back it was lift with 16 seconds.
 Skynse: Hehe, you could say I timed myself, now I know that it takes 15 minutes for me to bath
 mlemm: are you naked then&#160;?
 Skynse: NO
 Skynse: oops caps was on
 mlemm: i tought bath duration only includes bathing
 Skynse: I don't really bath according to the standard term of bathing
 Skynse: I think you're thinking of the "bath" where you sit in a tub of water
 mlemm: so you stand up, i see.
 Skynse: I just fill water in a bucket, get a sponge, rub it with soap and clean myself, then take a pale and pour water on myself
 Skynse: I can shower but eh
 mlemm: that's optimized bathing.
 Nerchio: normally at this point i have 2k lines of code, only 700 so far though :D
 Skynse: dang
 emh: I have 558 lines of code. just submitted. hoping for Gold league hehe
 emh: normally I hit 2-3k lines of code at the end
 emh: but seems like less is necessary for this contest yes
 AntiSquid: already past me emh, how many nodes are you checking?
 Nerchio: 300 000
 MadKnight: so everyone is doing BS now&#160;?
 AntiSquid: not you, emh
 AntiSquid: did you hear that guys? MadKnight called your bots BS, are you going to let him do that without saying anything back? Automaton2000 say something
 Automaton2000: will it be possible to write a sim
 Nerchio: lol
 emh: AntiSquid 240k
 AntiSquid: ah ok i am only at 10k, completely unoptimized
 MadKnight: BS is Bathing Strategy, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and you have to loop over
 emh: I'm doing BFS
 emh: with some optimization on seen score
 Icebox: how the f do you evaluate 240k states :thinking:
 Icebox: do you consider learning spells?
 Icebox: or just spellcasts?
 emh: yes
 Icebox: bruh .-.
 AntiSquid: but why no gold at 240k&#160;?
 AntiSquid: bugs somewhere?
 emh: AntiSquid just submitted
 andrefpoliveira: For c++, what is the best way to measure time
 emh: waiting to see
 andrefpoliveira:&#160;?
 emh: Icebox build a transition table first from state to state using learn+spell,spell,dup spell,brew. then lookup the table in BFS
 emh: andrefpoliveira
 Icebox: I do have a transition table but you need to keep the track of tome tho
 emh: high_resolution_clock::time_point now = high_resolution_clock::now();
 emh: Icebox why tome?
 Icebox: to know what you can learn?
 emh: don't you only build the table once per turn? takes like 2-3 ms
 Icebox: oh you mean build the table every turn huh
 Icebox: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: so, how many states do you get Icebox?
 Icebox: just 50k but also unoptimized
 Icebox: and still testing
 sadakatsu: It takes 2-3 seconds to build your transposition table?  Now I am very sad.
 sadakatsu: *ms
 emh: sadakatsu why sad?
 sadakatsu: My version that uses a transposition table builds it while I sim, and I get maybe 2,000 nodes within 50 ms...
 emh: what lang?
 sadakatsu: C++
 sadakatsu: Though it is certainly not my strongest language.
 emh: hmm.. using arrays? or STL?
 sadakatsu: So far, I'm using STL.  I have an `unordered_set&lt;GameState&gt;` and a `std::has&lt;GameState&gt;`.
 emh: I'm using mostly arrays
 MadKnight: hmm i'm usingbool[10][10]
 sadakatsu: I have ideas to write something myself, but I don't have the time during my workday.
 emh: but vectors for children
 MadKnight: bool[10][10][10][10]
 emh: MadKnight is it joke? seems like strange configuration
 AntiSquid: lol
 MadKnight: it's a single-player config
 sadakatsu: For my next attempt, I am going to use something that fits within a `int_fast64_t`, and will then write a static transposition table to use those for hashing.
 emh: uint16_t ret = i0 | (i1 &lt;&lt; 4) | (i2 &lt;&lt; 8) | (i3 &lt;&lt; 12);
 emh: only need 16 bits for the state
 Zenoscave: what about totals?
 sadakatsu: By my calculations, I need 62,
 emh: Zenoscave totals? what you need them for?
 Icebox: emh ah a fellow bit user
 emh: hehe
 Zenoscave: I use 30 bits
 emh: I only use totals while building the transposition table
 sadakatsu: I wanted 30 bits, but I don't see any way around using 46 bits for the spells.
 emh: for the spells I use 64
 Icebox: I use more bits tho to represent negative numbers and keep it same for both spells and state
 emh: but I'm not actually using the spell bits now
 emh: anymore
 emh: using the vectors of children nodes with a bunch of data
 emh: only states are "compressed"
 sadakatsu: Arg!  Too interesting.  DO YOUR JOB, SADAKATSU!  &lt;leaves /&gt;
 phord: :laugh: :wave:
 emh: you have to work sadakatsu? how sad akatsu
 Zenoscave: CASTS LEARNS and BREWS are all 30
 emh: damnit.. seems like not Golden boy yet.. 135 and 67%
 emh: I win against boss though so just need to get to it
 emh: probably should start to take into account fast spellers
 emh: with opponent score

 emh: final rank 76.. ok resubmit
 emh: PatrickMcGinnisII how to use those numbers?
 NitMpez: just ranking spells that you should attempt to learn
 RockyMullet: my lights of flashing... not now, I need to fix my bot's perf :sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: when almost every league is the size of a multiplayer :thinking:
 RockyMullet: AntiSquid yeah, I wonder, is it the biggest contest ever&#160;?
 RockyMullet: or was that hexagonal boat one bigger&#160;?
 AntiSquid: it is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's just a single use type thing... so you subtract the tax/2, if it's still &gt;=0 might as well learn it
 RockyMullet: kk
 AntiSquid: rocky pirates of the carribean had some forced submits in it
 AntiSquid: pacman beat pirates despite that fact
 RockyMullet: :O
 AntiSquid: now this game beat pacman
 RockyMullet: pacman was fun, I'll come back to it after this contest
 AntiSquid: by a lot
 RockyMullet: how many submitted bhot now&#160;? 5k-6k&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 6500+++
 RockyMullet: damn
 AntiSquid: last contest it was 4950 or so
 RockyMullet: yeah its first by a big margin
 AntiSquid: need to add timer to my turns 
 lowzhao: what happend again ... the timeout wave is coming
 ParticleBeam: Oh for some kind of API call to see how much time you have left according to the referee
 MSmits: hi guys
 MSmits: me sad, no time for contest&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: hi
 AntiSquid: lol i thought you're stuck overengineering and overplanning
 MSmits: was hoping to make time this weekend, but not gonna happen
 MSmits: nah, it's just a lot of work / study stuff, too much to handle
 ZarthaxX: i still love you smito
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i tested against your bot yesterday ParticleBeam, helped me improve by about 300 spots and made me realize I had to do a full rewrite.
 MSmits: love you too zarthy
 emh: hi MSmits
 ZarthaxX: this game has bits magic too smito
 MSmits: i did make a self learning hexapawn bot :P
 ZarthaxX: you are missing&#160;:(
 MSmits: i know
 ZarthaxX: :O nice
 MSmits: its for work though
 MSmits: to explain machine learning in a very simple way
 RockyMullet: MSmits a search heavy one too, that's your specialty :O
 MSmits: I know
 MSmits: i did get into bronze last friday, after that no time
 struct: Hello MSmits
 struct: long time
 MSmits: normally for contest, i work ahead so i have 10 days to spare, but i moved in october
 MSmits: so i was already behind on work and studie
 MSmits: hi struct
 MSmits: good to see you
 AntiSquid: yup timeouts at 40ms 
 MSmits: btw if anyone wants to try it for this contest
 blasterpoard: hi MSmits ... I too haven't cubmitted in 4 days because I have no time&#160;:(
 MSmits: I am thinking smitsimax 
 struct: thanks, good to see u2
 emh: hehe
 MSmits: sucks blasterpoard
 struct: blasterpoard did smitsi earlier iirc
 MSmits: maybe this weekend?
 AntiSquid: blaster is gold already lol
 AntiSquid: some kinda indirect humble brag right there
 MSmits: not sure, blaster is really good, might be the algo is handicapping him :P
 Astrobytes: Hey MSmits&#160;:)
 struct: MSmits but wont smitsimax have the same problem that it would have on FB?
 MSmits: hey there Astrobytes
 MSmits: struct it would i think yes
 MSmits: but you can make nodes into objectives maybe? Combined with heuristics
 MSmits: i am just guessing, i spent too little time on this, just 2-3 hrs
 AntiSquid: i just don't see how it's possible to time out if i go over 25ms .&#160;:/
 blasterpoard: im not getting handicapped by the algo, but work + online uni leave me with &lt;6 hours of sleep
 blasterpoard: the algo got to #1 early on
 MSmits: either you're timing wrong, or something big happens after your last measurement AntiSquid
 MSmits: thats great blasterpoard
 Astrobytes: there are timeout issues currently tho
 AntiSquid: i am breaking out of the big stuff 
 struct: CG is having timeout issues
 blasterpoard: currently, if you go over 26ms, there is a chance of randomly timeouting
 struct: Even at 40ms I get timeuts sometimes
 AntiSquid: that's 30 ms time to do the stuff that my code usually does in 0.1 ms if i don't push it
 Icebox: so I was onto something when I talked with reCurse about this on discord huh
 MSmits: ahh ok on CG side
 MSmits: makes sense
 Icebox: cause I never experienced anything like it
 MSmits: is re curse playing?
 NoobCod3: hello guys
 Icebox: I believe so, is he?
 MSmits: good
 Astrobytes: we were experiencing these issues in some multis too past few months
 NoobCod3: hello everybody
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Not speaking for him but it's a "maybe" from re Curse. Hope he does.
 Nerchio: ofc he's playing
 Icebox: he's probably working 24/7 on it but won't submit if it's not 1st kappa
 Icebox: :D
 Nerchio: why do you think hes chatting about the game all the time in discord and here :D
 AntiSquid: because he's playing dota and chatting while queuing up 
 reCurse: 1) Because it's fun to chat on CG when it's not dead 90% of the time. 2) I mentioned 3 possibilities: not playing, hiding, smurfing
 Astrobytes: ^
 lowzhao: learn more is very useful
 Icebox: wait what does smurfing accomplish?
 reCurse: Deniability
 Icebox: oh
 Astrobytes: :D
 Icebox: of course :D
 AntiSquid: make people feel bad for getting wrecked by a level 3 
 MSmits: reCurse I'm just glad to see you participating
 MSmits: even if it's an open secret
 reCurse: fwiw I was active on the chat during ooc and didn't actually play much beyond a day or two
 AntiSquid: let's guess the smurf then? what are the chances he is learning Rust&#160;?
 Icebox: same msmits, when recurse is in the chat, the chat seems at least 5 years more mature on average :D
 RockyMullet: yeah smurfing is good, like everybody knows I suck, but nobody knows what reCurse is doing, so if he fail, he can only say he never participate
 Icebox: nice to have you back :D
 reCurse: Are you sure it's not just the contest attracting more mature people? :thinking:
 Icebox: do you want me to share my 5am chat screenshot collection?
 RockyMullet: old witches brings old coders
 reCurse: 5am chat, spooky
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 Icebox: or some classic lvl3 meetups
 NinjaDoggy: I've overtaken Psyho as the best bot to only learn for the first 8 turns
 NinjaDoggy: :D
 Icebox: they can communicate in emojis only tho
 Icebox: so noone will understand
 RockyMullet: That's late night NA chat, it can go south yeah haha
 Icebox: yeah that's what I mean :D
 RockyMullet: when the european admins are sleeping, the edgy 13 yo americans are awake
 RockyMullet: at least reCurse is admin now
 reCurse: :hammer:
 Icebox: me still no icon reeee
 ParticleBeam: Ban all hammers
 Icebox: I had it 4 times now
 Icebox: and it's gone again
 AntiSquid: just mods
 NinjaDoggy: doesn't admin just lag your codingame experience? :P
 reCurse: Just rumors, it lags for everyone
 Astrobytes: Icebox is it definitely gone [your mod status] or is it just your mod icon? Ille dan shows up without icon but can still mod
 Icebox: just icon
 reCurse: Undercover mod
 Icebox: :hammer:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you're 1337, you should be happy!
 Astrobytes: IceSpy
 struct: Its not meant to be Icebox im sorry
 dqiu27: hi
 RockyMullet: hello
 Astrobytes: was the site wonky there for a bit or was it just my end?
 AntiCheap: Let's goo!!!
 AntiSquid: are you winning son&#160;?
 AntiCheap: No :P
 AntiCheap: I'm waiting for it to settle
 AntiCheap: I need to pass so I can have fun
 AntiCheap: I must ensure nobody is first in silver using go
 AntiCheap: Full respect to optplx still
 optplx: :joy:
 AntiCheap: How long do we need to wait XD
 AntiCheap: I think my old code would've passed too but I didn't wait enough
 optplx: it seems much longer than usual doesn't it?
 AntiCheap: yeah
 AntiCheap: I got here always going for top price potion&#160;:')
 optplx: 25 minutes so far and it says 70% done
 AntiCheap: at least we know we may pass
 AntiCheap: It's bad when you need to confront algorithms
 optplx: fingers crossed
 AntiCheap: I was invited by Karang I need to be in same league at least 
 optplx: I have just optimized mine memory wise after a while of twicking and tricking
 optplx: you ll pass for sure
 AntiCheap: I sum invs as u32
 optplx: I m closer to bossdorf
 optplx: ah nice trick
 optplx: will do 
 AntiCheap: He said I'm using SWAR or something like so.
 AntiCheap: I just played around with a site he sent me to see assembly code.
 AntiCheap: I learned a good amount of things with this game
 AntiCheap: The algorithm is pretty basic still
 optplx: i was brutally storing entire structs in my loops, I have removed like 90% of it and increased the depth of my tree by more than 3 times
 optplx: yeah the algorithm was not the issue
 optplx: it was the perf
 AntiCheap: I started with js and I got to 9k nodes rust got to 480k but I had to lower them as most were useless.
 AntiCheap: I took more time to find best potion to brew
 optplx: haha nice, rust is on my todo
 JeovanGomes: hello
 optplx: everybody talks about it these days
 AntiCheap: to me it's just cleaner
 AntiCheap: stinky boss grows
 Beresta: damn, #62 in silver, 2 loses out of 4 timed out on 1st turn&#160;:( 
 AntiCheap: I still time out and brew pots that make me lose&#160;:(
 Beresta: yea, I haven't yet touched endgame at all
 optplx: timeout for me was more due to memory actually 
 Beresta: even if 1 brew remaining to end the game - my bot plays as if it was early
 AntiCheap: I'm not sure how much memory is occupied by game states as I store them
 AntiCheap: but on js I had big problems
 optplx: it was about 300 to 400 mb if i recall correctly
 optplx: huge
 optplx: that's it @AntiCheap 
 optplx: good job
 AntiCheap: GL 
 optplx: hope to see you soon :p 
 optplx: thx
 AntiCheap: Everything apart I'm having a lot of fun
 optplx: yeah me too
 AntiCheap: By everything apart I mean I didn't study for maths and got 4.5/10
 optplx: :laughing:
 Astrobytes: Come on man, don't slack on your maths
 Astrobytes: It'll pay off later&#160;;)
 RockyMullet: yeah math &gt; everything
 AntiCheap: Nothing personal with maths
 AntiCheap: Just the teacher annoyed me
 RockyMullet: that I can understand
 Astrobytes: I had the same issue in secondary school, failed it yet got top grades in physics (work that one out). Did it later in dedicated courses at Uni and by myself
 Astrobytes: And now calculus is afraid of me.
 Astrobytes: (that's a joke)
 AntiCheap: The teacher wants proof his way, the point is he never proves anything.
 AntiCheap: Yesterday I tought he was gonna calculate euler's number I tought he was mad.
 AntiCheap: In the end he just replaced with another formula he knew.
 Astrobytes: Is he just getting you used to proofs or what?
 Astrobytes: (I don't know what level you're at)
 AntiCheap: I'm in high school. He makes a mess when explaining.
 Astrobytes: If you don't like the way your teacher explains things there are numerous places on the interwebz with strong maths tutorials
 Astrobytes: Some of the youtube ones are really cool
 AntiCheap: I understood more with 10 minutes of a stupid khan accademy video than in 1 month.
 AntiCheap: Problem is he wants to hear wrong things his way.
 Astrobytes: Khan Academy vids are not stupid
 AntiCheap: By stupid I mean simple
 AntiCheap: Not bad
 JeovanGomes: comecei a pouco tempo com a linguagem C alguma dica?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we all get teachers like that. But if you get the Khan academy vids better, then it doesn't matter. Just learn the maths and you'll pass your exams
 struct: JeovanGomes #pt
 Astrobytes: And ENJOY it if possible, when you get it it's great fun
 Astrobytes: Or at least very satisfying&#160;;)
 AntiCheap: My solution is very simple, say fuck him in a way he doesn't understand, once i'm out of this school say so in a way he does.
 Astrobytes: Stuff your teacher, just learn however you can if he's not helping 
 Zenoscave: Sum(Orders, Order.Price / TurnsToComplete(Order))
 Zenoscave: why is this^ not working well?
 AntiCheap: I wanted to add funny texts to the actions
 AntiCheap: all I need to make fun of is my code haha
 Astrobytes:  I truly wish youtube was around when I was at highschool

 ParticleBeam: Zeno, from what I've seen, the bot might chase the next "best" solution until it runs out of turns or the other bot makes 6 potions?
 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: post that link in #clash then ask people to join in here - it pollutes the chat
 AntiCheap: Btw couple days ago I joined a code clash I got so pissed as someone "hardcoded" replies. I tried doing so and it didn't work so I lost.
 AntiCheap: 2x dumb
 Zenoscave: ParticleBeam It always choses cheapest
 Astrobytes: they hardcoded for the validators? Were they the same as the tests?
 Zenoscave: I'm trying to get around it
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew
 AntiCheap: They hardcoded replies for inputs
 Astrobytes: yeah when you submit the inputs are supposed to be different from the ones you get in the IDE (but similar)
 Zenoscave: pewpew astro
 Illedan: Wow, wala with Java :O
 Astrobytes: AntiCheap: so either the validators are the same as the inputs or the user knew the validators
 Nerchio: yeah wala very impressive
 Astrobytes: Still in bronze with highly minimal effort. I keep trying to start a proper bot but I get distracted or bored&#160;:/
 AntiCheap: I tried to set up a proper bot, too. I still need to implement learning.

 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: did you see my previous message?
 Icebox: no, I don't think I will
 Counterbalance: !banhammer incoming!
 NguyenVinhHien:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: Post clash links in #clash
 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: Then invite people to your clash like "join me in #clash"
 Cappefra: how strong do you have to be to be ranked 31 having last submitted on the 14th
 Cappefra: crazy
 NguyenVinhHien: ok
 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: You can post "join me in #clash" in this chat, just not the link. It makes the chat messy&#160;:)
 NguyenVinhHien: oke
 NguyenVinhHien: i see
 Astrobytes: awesome
 Astrobytes: Also, people will see your clash in the clash page anyway
 AntiCheap: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/506435113">https://www.codingame.com/replay/506435113</a> is it real this enemy still doesn't show his real behaviour?
 Astrobytes: Arena match or IDE?
 AntiCheap: IDE
 Astrobytes: Well, the Rust debug mode issue is fixed so he must have timed out legit. 
 Astrobytes: (emil. is using Rust)
 Astrobytes: Reproducible?
 AntiCheap: Same 🦀
 AntiCheap: I'll try another match
 NguyenVinhHien: #join me in clash
 NguyenVinhHien: join me in #clash
 Icebox: there u go
 Astrobytes: lol rustacean city :D
 Astrobytes: Perfect NguyenVinhHien&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: You have to post your clash link in #clash &lt; click on this
 NguyenVinhHien: excute me which programming language is good for web back end?
 Astrobytes: How long is a piece of string?
 ParticleBeam: Anywhere between 1 and 6
 Icebox: I've seen a piece of string be 7 long
 ParticleBeam: Null I say
 Astrobytes: I've seen one at 8 and 20.3 long at the same time
 Astrobytes: ^I think "that was" would have been better than "at" on reflection :o
 Icebox: all my strings are at 8 long
 NguyenVinhHien: join with us #clash
 Astrobytes: all my strings are 1.616255(18)×10−35 m
 Zenoscave: is that a plank
 Astrobytes: yesh
 Astrobytes: minus a ^
 Zenoscave: fair
 ParticleBeam: planck?
 Astrobytes: With a name like ParticleBeam you should know, no? :D
 reCurse: Nice
 ParticleBeam: Perhaps. I think it's spelled "planck" though
 Zenoscave: I thinck you're right
 Astrobytes: (hence my comment&#160;;) )
 NguyenVinhHien: join #clash
 Astrobytes: Max Plank worked on pirate ships
 Zenoscave: Getting kinda spammy NguyenVinhHien
 NguyenVinhHien:&#160;?
 NguyenVinhHien: i invite everyone join clash
 Zenoscave: No one is joining clash because there's an active competition
 NguyenVinhHien: its wrong?
 Zenoscave: not wrong. just a bit too frequent for me
 Zenoscave: maybe I'm wrong
 Astrobytes: It's not a great time for clashing, there's a multiplayer competition running NguyenVinhHien
 Icebox: look at it this way NguyenVinhHien, how many of us did join your clash?
 NguyenVinhHien: invite everyone join clash is spamming?
 Icebox: from the chat
 Icebox: I can help you with that, it's probably 0
 reCurse: Only 200 active submissions? Did they hire more hamsters or people are giving up?
 NguyenVinhHien: i still invite. dont bother you join or not 
 Astrobytes: Asking is less spamming than posting the links but just don't ask too often NguyenVinhHien, if people don't join - it means they don't want to
 Icebox: ^
 Icebox: reCurse people giving up on the hamsters I think
 NguyenVinhHien: where can i see the numer of onlining?
 NguyenVinhHien: you dont want its not mean that others dont want
 Icebox: As a moderator of this website and the CG community as a whole I'm pretty sure he's a good representation of what we want and what we don't want NguyenVinhHien
 Astrobytes: That's why I said it's OK to ask, but don't ask for every single clash
 Astrobytes: @NguyenVinhHien
 NguyenVinhHien: the unfriendly community
 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: Just chill bro
 Astrobytes: Really
 JBM: oooh, is it here we can be unfriendly?
 Astrobytes: Make clashes
 Astrobytes: People will join!
 NguyenVinhHien: thanks but i dont want
 reCurse: Where's deepmind when you need it
 Icebox: then don't play if you don't want it NguyenVinhHien
 Icebox: noone is forcing you
 NguyenVinhHien: yep thanks
 NguyenVinhHien: i think hackerrank is better
 reCurse: Bye
 Icebox: then you're on the wrong website I think
 Astrobytes: NguyenVinhHien: did you try puzzles or multiplayer bot programming?
 Astrobytes: Should I just give up now?
 reCurse: You have the patience of a monk
 Zenoscave: I think yes
 NguyenVinhHien:&#160;:)
 NguyenVinhHien: bye
 Icebox: :wave:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I wish I had less sometimes tbh
 amitrishi: hello guys
 amitrishi: I wanted to know the codinggame tutorial question where it asks to find a number in a sorted array. if I solve by writing my own binary search, it says I did not use the library function
 amitrishi: How can that affect when I give a test
 Astrobytes: Is this an interview/screening test amitrishi?
 pde-bakk: Sometimes the goal of an exercise isnt to show you can code everythin yourself, but to show you the (library) tools you have at your disposal
 ClockSort: can someone provide the link to the competition? thanks!
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 Astrobytes: ClockSort: For future reference just click on COMPETE at the top of the page, or the home icon, should find it that way too
 amitrishi: it is a tutorial inside a interview invite
 ClockSort: oh, fall challenge 2020. yep that's a doozy. :D
 ClockSort: i'm Gold #75, thinking of starting over in C++ :P
 Astrobytes: Ah OK amitrishi, which language? They seem to be expecting you to use the language features in this case rather than your own implementations, as pde-bakk said
 amitrishi: hmm
 amitrishi: But it is not clear from the question to use library function..
 amitrishi: i hope when i give the actual test, there should not be any ambiguity
 Astrobytes: What position is the interview for?
 amitrishi: senior software engineer
 Astrobytes: language?
 amitrishi: c++
 Astrobytes: Have you spoken with your recruiter to determine what they expect?
 amitrishi: nope
 amitrishi: I will send them a mail to ask
 Zenoscave: That mightbe a good idea
 Astrobytes: When is your test?
 Astrobytes: *deadline for your test
 Astrobytes: And definitely contact them to see what they expect,  or everything will go wrong from the start to be honest with you!
 TC9792: is there an easy way to find out battles that I lost?
 Zenoscave: Look at last battles
 Zenoscave: on the left in the ide
 TC9792: ya but need to go though them one by one?
 amitrishi: thanks for your suggestions guys
 Zenoscave: Yeah
 TC9792: ok thx
 Astrobytes: amitrishi: good luck man&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: OK, out for tonight, laters everyone, take care
 amitrishi: thanks
 amitrishi:&#160;:)
 Icebox: adios Astrobytes
 JohnCM: haha now rank 200 silver, i'm on my way to gold
 miszu: I am happy I reached silver
 miszu: I don't feel like to try for gold
 NinjaDoggy: icebox, C++ rewrite/Gold when?
 Icebox: long since done
 NinjaDoggy: um...
 NinjaDoggy: why is it not submitted?
 Icebox: because a) the servers are dying anway
 reCurse: Not anymore
 Icebox: and more importantly b) because I can work on it without submitting
 Icebox: so what's the point :D
 NinjaDoggy: but it's way harder to come up with ideas without seeing the current short comings?
 Icebox: no need for ideas
 Icebox: I just need to pump those sim numbers up&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: ok!
 NinjaDoggy: I'm honestly so sad...
 NinjaDoggy: Fall challenge ends basically right as break starts&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: what do I even do
 miszu: try writing in assembly.
 miszu: with that you can increase the sim numbers
 Icebox: no supported on cg unfortunately&#160;:/
 Icebox: not*
 miszu: otherwise everyone would jump to it
 NinjaDoggy: and for most people, compilers write better assembly anyways right?
 Samer: what kind of sim numbers are you guys getting?
 NinjaDoggy: 50-100k&#160;:(
 miszu: in 50ms that's a lot
 NinjaDoggy: used to be a lot higher before I added opponent sim and stuff
 Samer: guess i should quit, i'm at 3k lol
 RicksMLC: 38
 RicksMLC: which might explain why I am still in Bronze&#160;:)
 miszu: RicksMLC I got silver with no simulations
 therealbeef: with 'sim number' you mean the number of state-actions you evaluate?
 miszu: just awesome heuristics
 Icebox: yeah pretty much therealbeef
 RicksMLC: Actually, just joking.  I don't use simulations
 RicksMLC: semi-interesting heuristics and a bit of math
 NinjaDoggy: 1 simNum = 1 move + evaluation
 miszu: when I hear simulations, that reminds me how ppl simulated covid spread with the game: Plague inc.
 Icebox: just like the simulations
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 NinjaDoggy: move to iceland :D
 miszu: trying to do the puzzle of the week. The problem is hard to follow
 Samer: i ditched all classes and using only arrays and lists, still only getting 3k... dunno what to do next
 raymoo: I made a new heuristic that explores 20x less nodes, but the heuristic is slow enough that I get like 5% faster searching
 miszu: Samer, did you try bit operations?
 NinjaDoggy: easiest way to up your sim count
 NinjaDoggy: is to precompute all possible actions and how they affect inventory
 MACKEYTH: One thing I'm considering is capping my sim at a certain number of iterations then going with a best gues
 NinjaDoggy: store inventory as a number between 0-1001(inclusive) 
 NinjaDoggy: and store arrays for transitions
 Icebox: what 
 Icebox: no
 Icebox: not inclusive
 NinjaDoggy: oops i'm bad
 NinjaDoggy: 0-1000 inclusive&#160;:(
 Icebox: :D
 NinjaDoggy: spreading fake news&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: how could i
 Samer: miszu no.. i'm not that good of a programmer, i just know a bit c#... maybe silver is all i can reach in this competition
 NinjaDoggy: that's why I recommend precomputing&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: no fancy bitmask stuff needed and still relatively performant
 NinjaDoggy: also simplifies code a lot honeslty
 miszu: precomputing is good actually
 Samer: NinjaDoggy you mean precomputing in the first 1000ms?
 miszu: yeah
 Icebox: no
 NinjaDoggy: yes
 miszu: no?
 RicksMLC: maybe
 miszu: jesus
 Icebox: yes?
 NinjaDoggy: that's what i do at least
 RicksMLC: umm...
 NinjaDoggy: turn 1 doesn't matter too much for me
 RicksMLC: what was the question again?
 Icebox: well not the tome tho
 NinjaDoggy: and it takes like
 NinjaDoggy: 6 ms to precompute lol
 Samer: suppose i do that.. that's good for like 6-7 moves, and then what? backt to the crappy sim count
 NinjaDoggy: no, precomputing inventory updates
 Icebox: oh yeah
 Icebox: okay that's different
 NinjaDoggy: like given some inventory and some move
 NinjaDoggy: it's always going to lead to a fixed inventory
 Icebox: yeah yeah that's obv
 Icebox: do that to
 Icebox: too
 miszu: there are so many combinations of inventory upgrades, how can you map all?
 NinjaDoggy: "obv" because we talked about it before lol
 NinjaDoggy: there's not THAT many
 NinjaDoggy: 1001 inventory states
 Icebox: no "obv" because probably everyone in the top does is
 NinjaDoggy: 46 possible tomes
 NinjaDoggy: 36 brews
 NinjaDoggy: 6 learns
 NinjaDoggy: up to 100 possible taxes
 NinjaDoggy: 1001*(46+336+6+100)
 NinjaDoggy: not that bad
 miszu: rip memory
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;? it's nothing...
 Icebox: it's not accurate but yeah :D
 NinjaDoggy: it's like
 NinjaDoggy: 0.8 megabytes
 NinjaDoggy: out of 768
 miszu: I dind't check but, do you have access to all info for all tomes?
 Icebox: yes
 ClockSort: a number between 0-1001 cannot store all inventory states
 miszu: there 5^10 combinations of inventories
 mzbear: why bother with the first 1000ms precalc? why not just generate a partial move dictionary offline for all possible recipes and then include it in the source in all its glory. who cares if the source is several megabytes large, it's still going to launch in under a second
 Icebox: it can ClockSort
 Icebox: I calculated it in chat on saturday aloready
 ClockSort: miszu is right, 5^10 &lt; 1001
 Icebox: nope
 ClockSort: well, &gt; 
 ClockSort:&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: there's exactly 1001
 NinjaDoggy: your 4 numbers have to add up &lt;= 10
 miszu: well 5, the empty
 NinjaDoggy: or add up to 10 exactly...
 NinjaDoggy: if you want to count empty for some reason
 Samer: i don't get it, how can you precompute that when you don't know which combination of 6 tome spells out of 42 you will get
 ClockSort: how do you represent the set of 10 Level-3 items?
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A000332">https://oeis.org/A000332</a>
 raymoo: you compute for all 42
 Icebox: with a bijection to some number ClockSort
 Icebox: what's your method of mapping is up to you
 ClockSort: each of your 10 inventory slots can have up to 5 different things in it . { empty, 1, 2, 3, 4 } so that's 5^10. What am I missing?
 miszu: some magic trick
 NinjaDoggy: order doesn't matter
 Icebox: because .1... and 1.... is the same
 ClockSort: iguess order
 NinjaDoggy: wait...
 NinjaDoggy: you're getting that many sims
 NinjaDoggy: when your inventory is an array of 10?
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;???
 ClockSort: how many sims are you getting with this trick, ninjadoggy?
 NinjaDoggy: i dunno anymore&#160;:(
 miszu: ohh I understand now
 ClockSort: my inventory is currently a C# ValueTuple&lt;int, int, int, int&gt;
 Icebox: uff
 NinjaDoggy: sim takes like no time compared to other stuff in my code
 ClockSort: and I'm getting 500000 to 900000 sims
 NinjaDoggy: 50-100k iterations
 NinjaDoggy: each iteration includes 1 sim
 miszu: order doesn't matter so there are 5^4 combinations
 NinjaDoggy: + a bunch of other stuff
 Icebox: you're telling me you get 900k iteratios while copying a 4 value tuple?
 miszu: so 625 combinations
 RockyMullet: well order matters
 ClockSort: icebox yes
 Icebox: miszu incorrect again
 ClockSort: in c# too
 miszu: order doesn't matter
 Icebox: I sent you the formula
 miszu: you store 4 ints
 ClockSort: i'm a madman
 miszu: yeah I forgot you can have 10, 0, 0
 ClockSort: honestly i'm surprised too&#160;:)
 reCurse: I don't want to rain on your parade but number of sims doesn't mean anything
 reCurse: This is uttt all over again except somehow worse
 Icebox: no, that doesn't sound right ClockSort
 miszu: Icebox, I don't get your 1001 # of states
 JohnCM: resting matters though
 ClockSort: do you think I canfor(int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) { copy my value tuple } in 50ms?
 JohnCM: the order you rest
 NinjaDoggy: lol reCurse
 NinjaDoggy: only depth matters&#160;;)
 JohnCM: in python3 i can only evaluate 3k-5k nodes before timing out. depth2-3
 Icebox: 1 mil sims is one nanosecond to copy a 4 valued tuple and modify 4 values of it
 NinjaDoggy: i'm exhaustively searching all my possible moves in combo with opponent combo moves for a depth of 8+ avg&#160;;)
 Icebox: assuming you don't do ANYTHING else
 JohnCM: c++?
 ClockSort: icebox  maybe i'm counting wrong?
 NinjaDoggy: i think icebox is right about this one'
 Karang: since when copying 128bit is slower than 32&#160;?
 Icebox: that's not how that works karang :D
 ClockSort: do these depths seem right for having 12 casts and 5 brews (no LEARN)? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/506534604">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/506534604</a>
 Icebox: copying a TUPLE is slower than an integer
 NinjaDoggy: at the end of the day, the only number that matters is the rating&#160;:)
 Karang: what language?
 NinjaDoggy: @clocksort depends on your state and pruning but yes
 NinjaDoggy: so I guess you're counting right
 ClockSort: no pruning. here's a better example with a better set of spells (more breadth) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/506528315">https://www.codingame.com/replay/506528315</a>
 NinjaDoggy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/506536907">https://www.codingame.com/replay/506536907</a>
 NinjaDoggy: for me I = number of nodes
 NinjaDoggy: and N = number of edges(aka transitions, aka sims i guess)
 NinjaDoggy: D is the search depth
 JohnCM: wow depth 7 amazing
 JohnCM: how is that possible?
 ClockSort: well if i visit a state twice, i don't spend time noticing that.
 ClockSort: and i do no pruning.
 ClockSort: that helps to be fast and stupid.
 Zhmyh: 700k nodes? r u insane?
 NinjaDoggy: eh...
 NinjaDoggy: it's worth noting repeated states
 NinjaDoggy: as you can see from the replay i posted
 ClockSort: well that's how you get 700k of them. most are the same :D
 Icebox: you can reach the same state with different amount of spells
 NinjaDoggy: I search 2 depths ish more
 ClockSort: are you pruning?
 NinjaDoggy: yes but no
 emh: rank 1 in Silver.. hmm.. ok will beat that boss soon I hope
 NinjaDoggy: yes, but it's same result as no pruning
 NinjaDoggy: 100% guarenteed
 ClockSort: why so?
 NinjaDoggy: perfect pruning&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: won't give away the trick in contest sry&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: you can find it on my post mortem in a few dadys
 NinjaDoggy: days*
 Zhmyh: do you have learned casts information in nodes?
 Icebox: if you're still relevant in a few days :D
 Icebox: jkjk &lt;3
 ClockSort: &lt;3
 ClockSort: whoa we both sent hearts without knowing the other would
 Icebox: it do be like that
 NinjaDoggy: why would you hurt me like that icebox&#160;:(
 ClockSort: my attempts at pruning are a mess which is why my arena bot isn't using it
 ClockSort: i need to upgrade to "perfect pruning"
 ClockSort: if you are hashing the state in order to detect duplicates, then it's even more important to keep the state small
 ClockSort: tuple of ints has more cost
 NitMpez: prune all nodes imo
 ClockSort: sorry ninjadoggy, i had to do it... rerun until i find a game where i beat you XD   <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/506545685">https://www.codingame.com/replay/506545685</a>
 NitMpez: get to depth 0
 Beresta: wua #5 in silver, so close
 ClockSort: congrats beresta!
 NinjaDoggy: hehe, nice!
 NitMpez: i beat emil once... he timed out
 Karang: NinjaDoggy you never learn after turn 8&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: for now yea
 Karang: i guess thats a good way of generating less nodes&#160;:)
 ClockSort: i tried some learning strategies and they were worse than stupid-learning
 ClockSort: if you only play against other stupid-learners then you are ok
 ClockSort: unless they are ninjadoggy
 miszu: you need to find an awesome strategy
 NitMpez: hope every match you play your opponent times out
 NinjaDoggy: I get 1.5 - 3 times more iterations if I don't use a hashmap...
 NitMpez: my strat... cros fingers
 NinjaDoggy: how freaking slow is that thing -_-
 Karang: it can backfire sometime <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/506546723">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/506546723</a> (sill he beats me most of the time)
 Icebox: what
 Icebox: accessing values NinjaDoggy?
 Icebox: or what
 NinjaDoggy: yea unorder_map&lt;int,int&gt;
 Icebox: jesus christ
 Icebox: *takes notes*
 NinjaDoggy: just 2 operations
 Zhmyh: I think it will be slower
 NinjaDoggy: get, and add
 NinjaDoggy: but it cuts my # of iterations down so much&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: F
 ClockSort: T
 NinjaDoggy: anyone have a homebrew hashmap?
 ZarthaxX: java?
 NinjaDoggy: no, C++
 ZarthaxX: ah, you are porting
 ClockSort: unlikely a homemade hashmap will beat the built-in one
 ZarthaxX: ah, you are already c++
 ZarthaxX: lol
 NinjaDoggy: wait what if I make a dumb one
 ZarthaxX: i have other things
 Karang: you need a hashmap or a hashset&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: map
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: otherwise I would use bloom filter
 NinjaDoggy: I guess... I could say screw it?
 NinjaDoggy: and just ignore collisions
 Karang: thats what i was going to suggest :p
 NinjaDoggy: if I'm only hashing like 100k ints
 NinjaDoggy: and I make an array of size 2 million
 NinjaDoggy: or 10 million or something
 NinjaDoggy: I won't get many collisions right?
 ZarthaxX: just throw memory :D
 ZarthaxX: if your hash function is ok
 ZarthaxX: possiblyt
 NinjaDoggy: can't I just use the int&#160;% array size?
 NinjaDoggy: and make array size prime?
 ZarthaxX: i just mean the int thing
 ZarthaxX: not the modulo part
 NinjaDoggy: because surely double the amount of computation outweights the negligible amount of collisions right
 ClockSort: make an array with int.maxvalue elements
 NinjaDoggy: uh....
 ZarthaxX: should yes
 Zhmyh: Isn't it what std::unordered_map does anyway?
 Zhmyh: hash(int) = int
 Icebox: yup
 Icebox: for integers it's identity function
 NinjaDoggy: ok I have some ideas about making a better hashmap
 NinjaDoggy: gonna go try them
 NinjaDoggy: and report back&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: surely I can make it faster since it's such a niech usecase
 ClockSort: ninjadoggy do you reuse your knowledge from the search at turn T during turn T+1?
 NinjaDoggy: nope
 ClockSort: why not?
 NinjaDoggy: um...
 NinjaDoggy: because I haven't implemented it :D
 NinjaDoggy: you're right I should
 NinjaDoggy: if no learns, or brews are done
 NinjaDoggy: I should resuse
 NinjaDoggy: thx
 ClockSort: that's a killer improvement
 ClockSort: it will let you seek to infinity and beyond
 NinjaDoggy: thx! lol
 ClockSort: (i was seeking beyond until i fixed my potion-counting code for game-end)
 Icebox: wow ClockSort, now you actually made his bot okay 
 Icebox: shame
 Icebox: :D
 NinjaDoggy: hey... my bot was ok before this
 NinjaDoggy: unlike someone sitting in silver &gt;.&gt;
 Icebox:&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:^)
 Icebox: might sit there till sunday
 Icebox: it's comfy here
 Icebox:&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: wait realization!
 NinjaDoggy: if i make my own hashmap
 NinjaDoggy: I can have a function that's add and check if exists at the same time :O
 NinjaDoggy: ok these are some sick performance gains I'm about to get
 ClockSort: if you make your own language you can make a funciton that plays and wins at the same time
 NinjaDoggy: XD
 Icebox: someone proposed assembly already&#160;:^)
 ClockSort: is the memory limit really 768MB?
 Icebox: yes
 MarekM: sometimes i have feeling that it is 768KB
 ClockSort: my state is 32 bytes. so i can seek up to 24000000 states. good.
 ClockSort: :laughing:
 ClockSort: ninjadoggy you should use a space instead of a pipe, it will make your debug output easier to read for your opponents&#160;;)
 Icebox: gamewinning tips
 phord: Doesn't emplace already let you lookup and insert at the same time?  Seems like there was a recent cost change, though.
 NinjaDoggy: nah I like my pipes&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: I need to truncate my doubles though...
 NinjaDoggy: who cares after like the 2nd digit
 miszu: I think I will give a try to reach gold
 miszu: everyone talking about sims and I will make my own sims... with blackjack table and hookers
 NinjaDoggy: wait darn, I can't take clock sort's advice of keeping previous info&#160;:(
 Icebox: that's the spirit
 NinjaDoggy: after I add in more advanced learning
 miszu: do I need to get rid of classes? Is using classes will slow down the sims by a lot?
 Bobbadillio: probably depends on language?
 miszu: C++
 Zhmyh: then no
 Bobbadillio: If it were python, almost definitely though :D
 Bobbadillio: switching to arrays would be a HUGE speedup
 miszu: yeah but arrays you need to know in advance the size and all
 miszu: and I will think how to precompute all permutations of inventories and spells
 miszu: but I still don't agree with the 1001 combinations of inventories
 Bobbadillio: miszu, do you know "stars and bars" from combinatorics?
 Zhmyh: but it's true actually muszu
 Beresta: how could you not agree with that
 miszu: mmm.. last time I used was in discrete math class 8 years ago
 Bobbadillio: ignoring everything but what's actually in your inventory, this is a classic "stars and bars" problem, and it turns into 14 choose 4 = 1001
 miszu: why 14?
 Bobbadillio: So, you consider a line of 10 stars, and you want to use the bars as separators to say everything before the first bar is category 1, everything between 1st and 2nd is category 2, and everything after the last bar is the last category.
 Bobbadillio: Here, there are 5 categories, tier 1/2/3/4/empty, so we need 4 bars
 Icebox: oh no not highschool PTSD again
 Beresta: I guess I'm bad at discrete as well, so I just counted loop of 4 with condition of sum &lt;= 10 :D 
 Bobbadillio: haha, yeah, and I'm not on top of my explaining game...
 Bobbadillio: point is, 4 bars let you separate 5 categories, there are 10 non-bar things that get separated into those categories
 Bobbadillio: So there are 14 slots that each get a star or a bar
 Bobbadillio: and you wind up choosing 4 slots to have a bar
 miszu: thanks for explanation
 Bobbadillio: so 14 choose 4
 miszu: still doesn't make sense :P
 Icebox: bruh
 Beresta: just do software engineering way
 Beresta: write a program to count
 miszu: I am not a math major
 NinjaDoggy: ^
 Icebox: this explanation was made so that 15y/o kids understand this :D
 miszu: I hated math since university
 NinjaDoggy: have to do it anyways to precompute them so it's fine&#160;:)
 Bobbadillio: miszu, this guy might explain better: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTCScjoPymA&amp;ab_channel=Numberphile">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTCScjoPymA&amp;ab_channel=Numberphile</a>
 miszu: I survived bachelor and masters in CS with minimal math
 miszu: and I am happy
 meh1001: Numberwang!
 miszu: discrete math brings me ptsd and I can hear the bombardment sounds
 miszu: Beresta, yeah I will use that method. Brute force but easiest to understand
 Bobbadillio: Sometimes I use a brute force trick too where I just allocate an array that's too big, and fill in only the stuff that's important/real
 Beresta: that definitely works to test it out
 miszu: I believe you the answer is 14 chose 4
 miszu: but... my head does not understand it
 Icebox: he believes
 Icebox: we did it
 miszu: gonna watch the video
 Icebox: oh
 Icebox: :D
 meh1001: so far my important takeaway from this video is A. get a giant sheet of brown paper to do math on cause it looks cool AF
 Bobbadillio: I bet you can get them pretty cheap too from a printing supply store.
 Icebox: pog
 Icebox: one undefined behavior less
 Icebox: progress
 miszu: so let's say we have an array of 1001 inventories. How you do the mapping? You need to map each inventory in a constant way
 miszu: oh I think I know
 Icebox: there are a million different ways
 Beresta: do it w/e way, whats important - your main sim should live only in mapped space
 miszu: a*x + b*y + c*z * d*j = index
 Icebox: I think that's one * too much
 Icebox: but yeah
 Icebox: that's an example
 miszu: what you mean in mapped space?
 Beresta: I mean conversion from int[] to int has could be w/e slow, if you do 99% manipulations with hashes only
 Beresta: hash*
 Bobbadillio: and hashes could work, but you could look at the 1001 inventories as a "natural" hash, so your indices are 0-1000, and then "living in mapped space" would look like calculating the transitions from one index to another after casting a spell
 NinjaDoggy: not to be lame but...
 NinjaDoggy: int mapping[11][11][11][11]
 NinjaDoggy: works quite well&#160;;)
 miszu: wow
 miszu: genious
 Bobbadillio: but you're inflating memory by a factor of 14! No ninjadoggy, don't do it!
 Beresta: I just do string.Join(",", deck) :D 
 miszu: you saved half a day of coding for me
 Beresta: but I do it like once per turn
 NinjaDoggy: hehe oops :P
 Inc_: And what do you map to?
 miszu: memory is cheap
 meh1001: What is the purpose of mapping the inventory states? Just like, tell me the theory name so I can google it on why this is advantageous
 NinjaDoggy: int...
 Bobbadillio: Also, won't mapping[1][3][2][8] result in pointer arithmetic that includes 3 multiplications and 3 adds?
 miszu: meh1001 optimization
 Icebox: int("".join([bin(i)[2:].zfill(4) for i in input]), 2)
 meh1001: optimization of what, though?
 Icebox: it's really that simple to map it tho
 Icebox: without array
 Beresta: and random memory jumps too with that many small arrays
 miszu: meh1001 more speed
 meh1001: lol ok
 NinjaDoggy: guys it literally gets used 2 twice a turn...
 NinjaDoggy: once for your inv, once for opp inv lol
 miszu: like the top people are looking for a way to make 1 operation less
 Beresta: purpose of mapping is to manipulate one single number instead of array of 4
 Redlander:&#160;:( 3rd but also 3rdunder the boss
 NinjaDoggy: yes once you map from input to number
 Bobbadillio: NinjaDoggy is keeping it real though, and I'm slumming it down here in Bronze :D I should get to it
 NinjaDoggy: you don't use the mapping array agin
 NinjaDoggy: ^^^
 meh1001: oh I see, instead of adding the inventories you just do a hash table lookup or whatever... 
 miszu: exactly
 meh1001: I think I'm so far from needing tha tlevel of optimization my brain didn't conceive of it
 miszu: so in constant time you get your transformation
 miszu: I am far from it too
 miszu: but people are flexing their # of sims per turn
 meh1001: I'd rather figurr out an effective way to consider learning spells and resting as part of my path
 Beresta: yea, but honestly speaking all these optimizations didn't give me expected results, I guess my bfs just east 100500x more resources :D 
 miszu: memory is cheap!
 miszu: I am waiting for someone to try to compress all the inventory into one integer
 Beresta: you know, cpu cache is cheaper and its much smaller than your memory :D
 Bobbadillio: But cache isn't, and sipping memory might let the whole thing sit in L3 cache on one of those new AMD epyc chips&#160;;)
 Bobbadillio: wait, Beresta and I are conflicting on whether cpu cache is cheap I think
 miszu: cpu cache is expensive
 Beresta: it is cheaper than memory, because, well, its cache for memory
 The_Duck: expensive in dollars, cheap in time
 miszu: ^ correct
 Beresta: I mean cheaper in performance terms, just in case :D
 Beresta: not in dollars lel
 miszu: are # of sims that helpful?
 Zhmyh: How to choose weights (parameters)?
 Icebox: GA
 Zhmyh: I have about 7
 Shparki: Does anyone else have any issue timingout when reading from stdin? 
 meh1001: I have never had that happen
 Shparki: I keep getting a has not provided 1 lines in time. before it reads the last line of the input
 meh1001: I would guess that you may be printing before the input is finished
 miszu: what would be a good heuristic function now that all spells are into place? Before I just said for each tier3 item could it as 5 for effort
 miszu: count*
 Bobbadillio: miszu, for iteration #, it depends on algorithm. If you're doing normal tree search, you want to be able to visit LOTS of leaves quickly to get to a good depth
 Bobbadillio: if you're doing MCTS, your move evaluation accuracy has something like a 1/sqrt(N) error term iirc
 miszu: yeah but reaching a leave is difficult no? Like you don't see new orders so you don't know when to end
 Beresta: to put it simpler, if two people have similar implementation for search - the one with higher # will have higher chance to win&#160;:)
 Bobbadillio: Beresta wins
 miszu: yeah I understood MCTS
 miszu: I take the math for granted though
 miszu: don't ask me to derive it :P
 Bobbadillio: In terms of getting to a leaf, you can randomly choose what the 'next' potion is, so getting to a leaf isn't too bad.
 Beresta: it is pretty much regardless of what you are doing, unless your full algo finishes in time and you don't have to cut
 Bobbadillio: for mcts
 miszu: yeah but random moves it can go into a loop and never finishing
 miszu: let me convert 1 item back and forth
 miszu: la la la
 Beresta: worst case you will finish turn 100
 miszu: oh right
 miszu: sigh... MCTS
 miszu: I guess go hard or go home
 Beresta: I'm still hacking around without any sim search, seems will be able to get in gold that way but not higher
 Beresta: will try to implement something on weekends&#160;:) 
 miszu: I don't see how you can reach gold without sims
 miszu: I reached silver and I barely made it
 Shparki: Yeah this is wracking my brain, i'm literally just printing the results and waiting and its timing out &gt;.&gt;
 Shparki: **print the inputs
 Beresta: well I only do brew paths search on bfs, otherwise it is heuristics to pick what to brew and what to learn
 Beresta: #3 silver atm
 miszu: question, do you know in advance all future client's order or no?
 miszu: or you only know the 1st 5?
 Beresta: no, only first 5
 Beresta: but there are like only 36 options
 miszu: because of "stars and bars"
 Icebox: no because they hardcoded 36 potions
 Beresta: no, because it is hardcoded in game lel
 Beresta: Bobbadillio 
 Beresta: fml sorry, copied wrong string
 Beresta: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 TC9792: do you recalculate the cost of each ingredients after you have learned a new spell?
 mel-hadj: only the first 5 that the hut can bear
 miszu: no I didn't recalculate. But if I do MCTS way, I don't need to
 miszu: just final score and that's it
 miszu: no heuristic
 miszu: just bugless game engine and massive optimization
 TC9792: I am trying to get into gold league without bfs at all, purely heuristic
 miszu: I tried that. Barely made out of silver
 TC9792: right now #423 in silver
 mel-hadj: are you guys targeting order or do you casting randomly?  
 miszu: if you want the optimal way to calculate the effort, you need to do a bfs of all inventory combinations and then you can see the cost
 Beresta: I target many things at once
 Beresta: several my orders, several enemy orders, proximity and stuff
 TC9792: but judging from my score, it seems pretty hard. Boss is 44.34, mine is 35.66
 TC9792: big difference lol
 Beresta: like if I can in 1-2 turns prevent enemy from making a potion I'll to it, instead of aiming for better potion myself
 Beresta: etc
 mel-hadj: wich one is working for this game BFS OR DFS&#160;?
 miszu: ppl are saying dfs
 TC9792: it is beam fs I think
 Beresta: wut, dfs never works, you will just stuck in worst possible solutions 
 TC9792: optimized bfs
 miszu: why ppl are not trying MCTS?
 mel-hadj: wich one is working for this game BFS or DFS
 TC9792: you dont wanna do dfs, you might stuck at a path which is not promising
 Beresta: miszu why? I think half of the gold using it
 miszu: oh okay
 miszu: alright tomorrow gonna work on the game engine
 miszu: at least I just need to do random moves
 miszu: no heuristics of picking best move
 Beresta: luckily this game is super easy to simulate
 miszu: well lots of moves to simulate
 Beresta: I've tried pure MC like day 3, it was terrible
 Beresta: comparing to my heuristics
 Beresta: :D
 miszu: problem with heuristics is the doman of the game. Hard to come up with a very good heuristics
 Beresta: but I wasn't doing it in a smart mcts way, just doing stats on first move
 miszu: oh yeah, you can save your mcts progress for next iteration
 Bobbadillio: Oh, full random playouts from the root node every time instead of creating 'real' new mcts nodes?
 Beresta: yea, was lazy and wanted to check it out
 Beresta: failed badly :D
 miszu: that's what I would do
 miszu: full mcts on 1st move
 Beresta: that won't work even for silver I guess
 miszu: how come?
 Beresta: too few simulations, very low chances of finding any decent path
 Beresta: and you are not guiding it anyhow towards good solutions
 miszu: yeah.. branching factor too high
 Icebox: also in the first turns you do nothing but learn
 Icebox: meaning once both players are done with learning the tome has changed completely anyway
 Icebox: invalidating your tree
 miszu: yeah but then you just recompute all
 Icebox: you won't get far with 50ms
 miszu: sigh
 Beresta: btw yea wanted to ask, do you (mcts) guys invalidate tree of each learn / brew? otherwise I don't quite get how to handle changes to the tree after that with new possibilities opened
 miszu: I guess I accept the fact I'll stuck in silver
 mel-hadj: but guys what's wrong with DFS
 kreska: i use bfs but im still in silver
 Beresta: you will never get back from like turn 95 with dfs
 Beresta: stuck in first worst solution you've found
 miszu: alright guys, I am done for today
 miszu: good night all
 miszu: time to workout
 Beresta: yea gn, I'm heading out too, 4am and working day tmr... :D
 mel-hadj: GOOD NIGHT BRO
 mel-hadj: it will stick? depends on how you handle your NOde  I GUEES
 TC9792: you might choose the best node at depth 1, but then the path follows it are terrible, you are stuck
 TC9792: with bfs, it will correct itself
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i'm so lonely&#160;::sob:
 Beresta: hell yess, last submissions before going to sleep brought me in gold
 hbouillo: Does BFS + sim without taking the opponent into account seem viable to get into gold?
 BrunoFelthes: if do you have a good score function, yes...
 hbouillo: I'm having troubles finding a good one, yeah...
 Rodrigo_the_coder: def score():
 hbouillo: Aha
 Rodrigo_the_coder: python
 Rodrigo_the_coder: so lonely... :sob:
 hbouillo: Get outside and do something else \:)
 hbouillo:&#160;:)
 Rodrigo_the_coder:&#160;???
 JohnCM: ok with pruning i can get to depth 4 now
 JohnCM: with python
 JohnCM: top 100 silver:)
 JohnCM: a few more optimizations can go gold i think
 ZarthaxX: holy shit JohnCM impressive
 JohnCM: python rocks
 miszu: I wish I could have access to the pseudo code of the silver bot
 miszu: what is its starts
 miszu: strats*
 JohnCM: pretty sure it is a bfs bot too
 hbouillo: Would love to see its pruning...
 JohnCM: it is very competitive though
 ZarthaxX: JohnCM BFS depth 4 no learn?
 JohnCM: my learning is by a separate heuristic method
 JohnCM: if not will be too many branches to consider
 ZarthaxX: i see, impressive heuristics then :P
 JohnCM: each learn action increases your breadth by 1
 JohnCM: it is like killing your lookahead by learning too much
 miszu: when you do bfs, what are you looking for?
 yhyoxx: &gt;.&gt;
 JohnCM: my end heuristic will be the value of the matching ingredients with any of the 5 orders
 JohnCM: so i try to optimize to maximize that
 miszu: do you consider the inventory that has enough stuff for a potion as a target?
 JohnCM: i perform instant brews
 JohnCM: means if my inventory matches, it is brewed immediately
 miszu: oh okay
 JohnCM: this helps to make space for spells
 JohnCM: and always try to aim for dual/triple casts
 miszu: you can go for like 10+ turns without brewing potions
 JohnCM: nah... 4-5 turns per potion is expected
 JohnCM: you have to
 JohnCM: if not cannot win
 JohnCM: the other strat is 6-7 turns for the most expensive potion
 JohnCM: then you do 5, opp do 6 also cannot win your score
 JohnCM: optimize like that i think can hit gold
 JohnCM: gold will then need to consider opp actions alr
 miszu: but how can you prune efficiently?
 JohnCM: i prune by inventory, if that helps
 JohnCM: cuts off a lot of branches
 JohnCM: it enabled me to go from depth 2 to depth 4
 JohnCM: XD
 JohnCM: anyway i'll share more once i get into gold
 JohnCM: need to optimize a bit more to try to get depth 5
 miszu: I thought you were gold
 JohnCM: silver top 100
 miszu: so much optimization for gold...
 JohnCM: this competition is optimization
 miszu: I feel the silver bot should be a gold bot
 hbouillo: Well gold is a small league right now, it makes sense
 JohnCM: i think i may switch over to C++ for gold
 JohnCM: python has hit a wall
 JohnCM: i've seen C++ go up to depth 8
 miszu: I reached silver in c++ with just heuristics 1 move ahead
 miszu: but here in silver it won't be enough
 JohnCM: i reached silver in python with 1 move lookahead also
 JohnCM: pure heuristics
 miszu: 50ms is not enough to do much
 miszu: I am astonished people can go depth 8
 meh1001: I coulnd't fathom a heuristic that effective
 Samer: i also feel the silver bot is a bit harder than usual
 BrunoFelthes: @miszu you need to pruning
 BrunoFelthes: i go 15, but with a looooooot of pruning, to much I think...
 hbouillo: I go 6 or 7 without pruning... But then my pruning sucks :D
 ValtAoi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1470213d959f210becdfd173d2d9e4e7a374ba0">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1470213d959f210becdfd173d2d9e4e7a374ba0</a>
 ValtAoi: anyone join
 miszu: thing is, I don't know in c++ what technique is optimal for speed computation and what now
 miszu: like using classes
 miszu: should I use 4 ints for my inventory
 miszu: or should I play with bits
 pde-bakk: I just used array&lt;int, 4&gt; for my inventory
 pde-bakk: stl is pretty neat
 hbouillo: I'm on 4 ints too
 pde-bakk: Is STL inefficient? My c++ code is riddled with STL containers
 miszu: if I write the game engine only in c++, wihtout heuristics or whatever, could I have feedback if there is any bottleneck in computations?
 hbouillo: No idea pde-bakk
 hbouillo: I don't have much free time miszu, sorry
 miszu: oh that's fine. Just asking in general not you specifically
 hbouillo: I know, but I'm answering because "no" answers is better than no answer at all!
 miszu: oh that's appreciated haha
 meh1001: you could ask strager on twitch to look at it, he does free code reviews
 miszu: I wish there was a c++ website about all tricks for optimization
 miszu: what to do and what to avoid
 JohnCM: pretty sure if you type competitive c++ programming, you would find them
 Shparki: Y'all, I still don't know what's up. I just timed it and it takes 0.09 sec just to read from stdin through input()
 miszu: lol tip #1: use  better compiler
 meh1001: weird, what language are you using?
 Shparki: python
 meh1001: me too and I'm definitely not having that happen&#160;:(
 meh1001: you are talking abtou running it in the web based IED right?
 meh1001: or are you running the ref local?
 hbouillo: Shparki don't time the input, reading from stdin will hang because the game won't send you input immediately&#160;:)
 hbouillo: But it doesn't count in the timeout
 Shparki: No true, but what I'm experiencing is a timeout before I even read my all lines
 hbouillo: Now that's odd
 meh1001: so like, if you refresh the code to the standard boilerplate and tell it to run, it runs out before it prints the end of turn thing?
 meh1001: be sure to asve your code before you do that if you try it
 Shparki: Oh for sure Ijust copy it over lol 
 Shparki: Maybe I've just been staring at the screen too long but I'm fairly confident its timing out before I even get to the good stuff 
 hbouillo: Alright, attemp #2352 to get to gold
 Shparki: (before I even get the opponnent line btw)
 hbouillo: 8/10 first battles won woohoo
 hbouillo: Just like the 234 previous times though
 miszu: I am rooting for you
 ValtAoi: #ProgrammerFriends
 hbouillo: 50% and I'm still over 400, not looking good
 JohnCM: silver boss is very hard
 hbouillo: Can't tell if it's hard or I'm sh*t :D
 JohnCM: i thought bronze was difficult already
 hbouillo: Aaaand another one
 miszu: board games are the easiest to simulate I find
 yhyoxx: both
 yhyoxx: u ever submitted and lost to literally everybody
 yhyoxx:&#160;?
 meh1001: I'm pretty sure I tied with some other other broken bots for last place
 hbouillo: Only when I left something that got me timed out :D
 hbouillo: Oh boi I'm climbing fast
 hbouillo: Is this the one?
 yhyoxx: im praying for u
 hbouillo: Did I manage to randomly fine tune my parameters to perfectly fit the league?
 hbouillo: I'm just changing stuff and hoping because I wanna see gold before sleeping haha
 yhyoxx: that's how i waste most of my time instead of rewriting a better algo
 hbouillo: 40% and 160th, so far so good
 yhyoxx: 56% 1080 -.-
 JohnCM: ok 50% win rate against silver boss
 JohnCM: let's see if can get gold
 miszu: 100% nd 1389
 yhyoxx: mood
 JohnCM: i'm timing out in half my games lol
 hbouillo: I'm sure there's some gold guys reading this chat in despair
 hbouillo: "What are these silvers doing"
 yhyoxx: 1130
 Rodrigo_the_coder: look at bar 1
 hbouillo: "You dont get to gold by submitting every minute"
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i am in despair now...

 yhyoxx: if ur still not using trigonometry
 JohnCM: ok changed my heuristics, now 80% win rate against silver boss
 JohnCM: wish me luck
 miszu: good luck man
 JohnCM: pls bump me to gold:)
 miszu: you used bfs right?
 JohnCM: actually i realized i used dfs with depth limit
 JohnCM: but either way it would be the same, 'cause bfs would evaluate all anyway
 miszu: make sense
 JohnCM: unless you selectively choose which branches to explore
 JohnCM: like monte carlo tree search
 JohnCM: then you can go deeper in some and not deep in some
 yhyoxx: im using bfs and limiting number of nodes, icant do more than 50k
 JohnCM: how do you count the number of nodes?
 JohnCM: you print out is it
 yhyoxx: and it's still useless
 hbouillo: BFS also allows you to go depth by depth, and thus stop at a time limit and not a depth limit, and not miss on other paths
 yhyoxx: i just `nodes++` on each node
 JohnCM: i see.. but honestly your depth limit is about the same regardless whether you time it or not
 JohnCM: unless you have fewer spells, you can go deeper
 JohnCM: but you won't know what the next order is
 JohnCM: so you can't search the tree fully in the first turn
 yhyoxx: true
 hbouillo: No, but your pruning can change with each iterations and BFS is the only one allowing that
 hbouillo: And a full usage of the 50ms you're granted
 hbouillo: I mean, between BFS and DFS, of course
 JohnCM: if my dfs converges to the same branch again, i'll quit
 hbouillo: There's many other ways that I don't know of
 hbouillo: Oof
 yhyoxx: im doing bfs on spells to find shortest path to target potion
 JohnCM: yup good idea
 JohnCM: i used a heuristic that takes into account depth
 JohnCM: so it's about the same
 yhyoxx: nice 
 JohnCM: so sad:( don't think i'll make it to gold
 JohnCM: haha
 yhyoxx:&#160;:(((
 hbouillo: I feel the same way
 hbouillo: But never give uo
 hbouillo: up
 yhyoxx: yea
 yhyoxx: i had so much energy at the begining
 Rodrigo_the_coder: # nevergiveup
 JohnCM: i can win the boss, but i can't win the top 100 ppl
 hbouillo: Same, even scrathed everything and did it all over three times
 hbouillo: Same
 yhyoxx: wasted so much time implementing minimax
 yhyoxx: now im dead inside
 yhyoxx: and fine tuning

 ValtAoi: so simple
 hbouillo: This submit is getting 95% win on the first 20 battles :o
 hbouillo: I might actually do it
 hbouillo: 40% 50th place!!
 JohnCM: nice
 hbouillo: My heart is racing
 hbouillo: C'mon little bot

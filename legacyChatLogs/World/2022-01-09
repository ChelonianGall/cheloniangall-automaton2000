 ASM_MOV_INT: good thing we weren't talking about sewer mechs...!
 ChrisTurpin: So, do all functions not work for all games? I'm trying to do a simple list.add but its giving me a unresolved reference
 ChrisTurpin: oh, nevermind I'm dumb
 C26_1: Haizzzz, idk if there is new things to learn abou
 C26_1: about*

 jacek: what a peaceful sunday
 DoctaHsieh: MEN
 Adiamant: did they remove solutions or something
 Adiamant: cant see the solutions of a puzzle i solved
 5DN1L: which puzzle, what language
 Adiamant: the power of thor in python 3
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1/solution">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1/solution</a>
 5DN1L: are you able to select Python 3 and see the solutions on the above page?
 Adiamant: yeah
 Adiamant: thats strange
 Adiamant: i only saw a leaderboard
 Lynch[0]: aot
 5DN1L: you chose the other Thor puzzle
 5DN1L: that was code golf
 Adiamant: thank you so much
 5DN1L: You're welcome&#160;:)
 Adiamant: guess ill have to live with my large ass code size
 zakacat: Puzzle of the week comes out on Mondays?
 struct: yes
 zakacat: sick
 zakacat: Because I need an easier one to pass the challenge, haha
 jacek: but onitama was already puzzle of the week
 struct: my bot cant solve this position...

 jacek: what side to move? :v
 struct: X
 jacek: then X likely wins, based on 10ms games in which X wins 99.8% games
 struct: yes i had 0.99 score on node
 struct: but wasnt solved
 jacek: and assuming X home row is still at lowest row, not the 5th row?
 struct: yes
 struct: maybe my wincheck has a bug
 jacek: mine cant solve it either
 struct: time to call MSmits
 jacek: Yavalath's best opening is 3 2
 struct: similar to bt
 struct: a2b3
 struct: ah wait all moves move from 2 to 3
 struct: :p
 jacek: do you have bitboard?
 struct: yes
 jacek: and solve 3-ply win in few ifs?
 struct: no ifs needed
 jacek: oO
 jacek: lookup tables?
 struct: I use lostearly
 struct: I dont check if a player won
 struct: I check if a player lost
 struct: if its a player turn to move
 struct: you can do this

 struct: it can solve up to 7 plies I think?
 struct: basicly if you are either attacking a 8th row cell
 struct: or a 7th row cell more times than its protected
 struct: you won
 jacek: perhaps i could expand mine more than 3 plies
 jacek: or 4&#160;:?
 jacek: if me to move and pawn in 7th row - win in next plyif not me to move, opponent doesnt have his pawn on his 7th row, i have not attacked pawn - win in next 2 pliesif me to move, i have attacking squares not attacked squares in 7th row (and opponent doesnt have earlier win) - win in next 3 plies
 jacek: something like that
 struct: yeah its kinda similar
 struct: but mine avoids the ifs
 jacek: so there is some win/lose situation if you have pawn in 6th row
 jacek: wonder if it can be expanded to 5th in some cases at least
 struct: maybe with some ifs
 jacek: ha!
 struct: o.o
 jacek: youre doing mcts?
 struct: yes
 struct: I might try minimax, not sure yet what will be better

 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 IceWrestler_6ce8: any tips?
 struct: start the floodfill from white space
 struct: or from o
 struct: ah wait
 struct: wont work
 jacek: does it need floodfill? find first + (its index), the width and height, and count the o in the area
 jacek: ahh its not rectangle
 jacek: hm
 struct: I would floodfill from white space
 struct: I think it will working
 struct: looking at testcases
 jacek: yeah
 struct: since a garden seems to need at least one white space
 IceWrestler_6ce8: barely getting any further at the moment xD, it's pretty hard
 jacek: thats what she...
 IceWrestler_6ce8: hahaha
 jacek: oh there can be more separated gardens 
 jacek: :x
 IceWrestler_6ce8: yeah......
 jacek: does last case contain whitespace? :thinking:

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: We need 3 guys to approve Alonehoc's 24 contribs
 jacek: oO
 darkhorse64: judging by the scores, rejection is more likely
 darkhorse64: hmm, this guy has haters, I have seen much worse puzzles
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yeah, just spot checking they don't look terrible
 struct: and they are clashes
 struct: if it was easy puzzles I would understand the downvotes
 struct: but being clashes I cant understand
 jacek: all clashes shall be rejected
 jacek: how can i make multiple pages in tech.io
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: could just be the volume.  last time this happened The_ZimaBlue had 40 approved and people hated most of them
 Jay10890: anyone got the answer to mars lander episode 1
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: what are you offering in exchange?
 Jay10890: a solution to a diffrent puzzle
 Jay10890: so what u say
 nicola: Hrm.
 Jay10890: can u help nicola
 nicola: For what?
 Jay10890: mars lander episode 1
 nicola: I remember having used just a test.
 nicola: If I fall too quickly, I burn fuel.
 nicola: Else, none.
 Jay10890: u got the  answer?
 nicola: Yes.
 Jay10890: what is it
 nicola: Find it by yourself. :D
 Jay10890: why cant u help me mod
 5DN1L: How about offering me the solution to this puzzle:
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/very_easy/vox-codei-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/very_easy/vox-codei-episode-1</a>
 5DN1L: episode 1 for episode 1, fair
 nicola: I want all the solutions of all the puzzles I did not solve.
 nicola: :grin:
 Jay10890: so if i solve vox codei u give me answer
 5DN1L: yes
 nicola: Vox Codei is far harder than Mars 1.
 Jay10890: how bout u give me the solution
 nicola: Nope.
 5DN1L: nah you see the link? nicola
 5DN1L: "very_easy"
 nicola: Yes, I saw. :grin:
 Jay10890: can i get the solution
 nicola: Nope.
 Jay10890: why
 nicola: Because it’s not in the rules.
 Jay10890: yah it means it can be done
 nicola: Yes, by yourself.
 Jay10890: i already did mars lander episode 1
 Jay10890: i just need the answer to it in pascal
 nicola: But you said that you needed help for Mars 1.
 nicola: Ha.
 nicola: In which language did you solve it?
 Jay10890: yah i need help with it 
 Jay10890: i solved it in
 Jay10890: c++
 nicola: So it should not be hard in Pascal.
 nicola: Just look how to code an if/then in Pascal.
 Jay10890: give me solution
 jacek: oO
 nicola: Nope.
 Jay10890: pls
 Nesse: hahah
 zedred: caught the chat in the middle, why would you want to do it in pascal?
 Jay10890: bc i can
 nesnes112: hi Alkhiljohn
 zedred: then do it x
 zedred: xD
 nicola: I even solved Mars 1 in VB.net.
 Jay10890: i dont care
 Rebollo: Guys can I return null, in C++, in a String type function?
 Rebollo: I am getting
 Rebollo: No viable conversion from returned value of type 'nullptr_t' to function return type string
 nicola: And yes, I solved it in Pascal and C++.
 Jay10890: cap
 nicola: Just learn how to write an if/else.
 Jay10890: ok
 Rebollo: tried NULL
 Rebollo: nullptr
 Adsonmin: nullptr is only for pointers
 jacek: try "" and later check for ""?
 Rebollo: actually it is a tuple
 Rebollo: I wrote string to simplify the question
 Rebollo: I don´t wnat to return like
 Rebollo: std::make_tuple("", "");
 jacek: oh
 jacek: i would create some global EMPTY_TUPLE
 Rebollo: good I will do that
 Rebollo: thank you
 jacek: later you would check if someting == NULL anyway right?
 jacek: so instead check if something == EMPTY
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: sure makes sense
 Rebollo: And this is the rule for any kind of type?
 MSmits: I would not call it a rule. You have to be careful with value and reference type
 MSmits: if you have a value type and it's a global, then the "==" will work
 MSmits: but if it is a reference, then you have to be careful
 Rebollo: I am sure that for custom types it is not cause I am usign node-&gt;parent == NULL
 Rebollo: a lot
 MSmits: oh this is c++
 MSmits: I just do nullptr
 Rebollo: tried nullptr already
 Rebollo: function is declared like that
 Rebollo: std::tuple&lt;string, string&gt; checkWhichWayToGo
 MSmits: what do you initialize this as?
 jacek: hmm, parent isnt pointer?
 MSmits: it's not?
 Rebollo: parent is but I just give and example, my problem is with std::tuple&lt;string, string&gt;
 MSmits: I never use a std tuple
 MSmits: I'd just use a struct
 Rebollo: I don´t know what I am using this
 MSmits: why are you using strings by the way?
 Rebollo: I need to return like two values
 struct: doesnt a tuple take 3 parameters?
 struct: don you wanna use pair?
 struct: dont*
 Rebollo: Ill create a structure
 MSmits: in my experience it is usually not a good idea to use strings for anything other than input and output
 nesnes112: hi @Alkhiljohn
 struct: pair&lt;string,string&gt; should work
 MSmits: the calculation in between is usually other types
 MSmits: like enum
 MSmits: or integers
 struct: tuple&lt;string,string,string&gt; should work
 struct: using these stuff is usefull sometimes
 BlaiseEbuth: std::array&lt;std::string, 2&gt; should work
 Rebollo: The why I am using string, is kind of ridiculous, but:I am creating a binary tree, and this function tell me if I need to iterate: "BACK", "RIGHT"
 Rebollo: "FRONT", "LEFT"
 Rebollo: lol
 MSmits: ok, really don't use strings in a binary tree...
 MSmits: just use an enum
 Rebollo: I decide to make the code readble, enum makes de work right?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: makes de work?
 Rebollo: I mean work fine for the purpose
 MSmits: yeah and enum are usually just integers so you can be sure it's a value type of fixed size
 MSmits: strings can have all sorts of sizes and are more complicated types
 BlaiseEbuth: No. Of course MSmits is advising you to do shit...
 MSmits: enums are good to learn&#160;:)
 MSmits: but if you need to go poopy, do :poop: . This is also good advice BlaiseEbuth
 Rebollo: Somwthing like that?
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/719d8fa0-f7b1-4e4d-bdb1-793134c9a217">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/719d8fa0-f7b1-4e4d-bdb1-793134c9a217</a>
 Rebollo: But at the end I am assignning a value to the enum itens which are strings
 Rebollo: struct X{
 Rebollo:     enum xDirection { left = 'l', right = 'r' };
 Rebollo: }
 MSmits: no, you dont put an enum in a struct
 MSmits: just 1 enum: directions, with all 4 options in it
 MSmits: and don't give them values of l r, d and u
 MSmits: either dont give them values at all, or give them 0,1,2,3, or 1,2,4,8, whatever you want. Lookup the syntax
 jacek: Automaton2000 does struct mind the hilights?
 MSmits: best is to google some examples of enums being used
 Automaton2000: do u have an idea of what you need
 MSmits: hilights? He changed his hair?
 Rebollo: I use string to make my code readeble, if I will assign 0,  or 1, at some point I will forget their meaning
 MSmits: no, you dont assign them, thats the whole point
 jacek: #define WTF 0
 jacek: kthxbai
 MSmits: gimme a sec
 Rebollo: If I dont assign how do a check?
 Rebollo: if (...
 MSmits: enum dir { left, right, up, down };
 MSmits: if x == dir.left
 MSmits: well with parentheses and all that
 MSmits: I work with python too much
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Rebollo: Hum I see
 Rebollo: sorry
 Rebollo: now I get it
 MSmits: you can also use enum dir { l, r, u, d };
 MSmits: and then use dir.l
 Rebollo: is it possible to create levels?
 MSmits: how do you mean
 Rebollo: HorizontalVertical
 Rebollo: Horizontal.LeftVertical.Up
 MSmits: if it is really necessary then you can, sure, but you'd just make two different enums
 MSmits: one for vertical and one for horizontal
 Rebollo: perfect
 MSmits: but they won;t have a hierarchy
 MSmits: you'd could make a struct
 MSmits: direction 
 MSmits: and give it a hor and a ver
 MSmits: which are 2 enums
 MSmits: but
 MSmits: you dont declare the enums inside the struct
 jacek: try inside Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: he said it was a joke
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4125bbe4-ba2a-44fa-a2f7-c241b37c08b9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4125bbe4-ba2a-44fa-a2f7-c241b37c08b9</a>
 MSmits: i could have some syntax errors
 MSmits: didnt test
 MSmits: didnt name the struct for one :P
 MSmits: oh and i am not sure if you can just say left in the struct, or you need to say hor.left
 Rebollo: got it!!thanks a lot sr.
 MSmits: good luck, I am sure something like this will work, sorry in advance if you'll run into some syntax errors before it works :P
 Rebollo: one last question, sorry
 MSmits: np
 Rebollo: And if I want to create a function that return one of the enum itens?
 Rebollo: Or a variable
 Rebollo: once I havent assign any type
 MSmits: which are the possible types to return
 MSmits: all 4?
 MSmits: left/right/up/down?
 jacek: up up down down left right left right b a start
 MSmits: you can't do that if you have separate enums, except maybe with templates and you should not work with those for now
 nesnes112: hi
 Rebollo: xDirections.LEFTxDirections.RIGHTyDirections.UP
 Rebollo: ....
 nesnes112: correct me please this instruiction
 nesnes112: 7for (let k=0;tab1[i].length;k++)
 MSmits: yeah xdirections and yDirections are separate types now
 nesnes112: for (let k=0;tab1[i].length;k++)
 MSmits: so need separate functions to return them
 Rebollo: maybe create a tuple with them lol, lol, kkkkkk
 MSmits: thats why before, i suggested to make 1 enum with 4 possibilities
 Rebollo: ok lets say i have one enum
 Rebollo: how a declare the func?
 MSmits: what is the enum called
 Rebollo: directions
 Rebollo: it became like a type?
 MSmits: it is a type yes
 MSmits: with 4 possible values
 Rebollo: perfect...
 MSmits: so you can do it as normal in a c++ function 
 MSmits: you just return a "directions"  type
 Rebollo: O my God it should accepct hierarchy structure
 MSmits: the reason that i really argued against doing anything with strings in a tree is that trees can grow large and if you use strings you're going to be orders of magnitude slower
 MSmits: it's just a bad habit to do anything with strings if you dont absolutely need to
 Rebollo: So if I want to hold a tree of words what would be the solution/ convert to binary?
 Rebollo: A tree of a words in a book
 Rebollo: or dictionay
 MSmits: well it depends on how many possibiltiies you have
 MSmits: binary means 2
 Rebollo: I mean
 Rebollo: convert binary represantation
 Rebollo: like
 Rebollo: A = 1
 Rebollo: B = 0
 MSmits: yeah but enum does that for you
 MSmits: without you even realizing it
 MSmits: internally it converts to a small representation, usually integer
 MSmits: which is like binary i suppose
 MSmits: even the words entire language can be represented in a smaller space than that of a 32 bit integer
 Rebollo: Actually I created a class called Word which has word, wordBinary, wordSize, BinarySize,  meaning, properties
 Rebollo: And it is a tree of my tyoe Words
 MSmits: ok, but how many possible words can there be?
 MSmits: if it's just those 4 directions, all of that is overkill
 Rebollo: thousands, millions
 Rebollo: the directions are just to control the iterate
 Rebollo: over the tree
 MSmits: yes, so use a simple representation
 Rebollo: the tree itself data is composed by Words
 MSmits: ohhh ok
 MSmits: but what does up mean then?
 MSmits: i thought you were using directions on a 2d map
 Rebollo: I use UP in a function that iterates over the tree and returhn each node DATA(word)
 MSmits: why is it called up
 Rebollo: so if it return UP
 Rebollo: I got up ion the tree
 jacek: oO
 Rebollo: just for controlling purposing
 MSmits: ok... forget my whole enum thing then, that's a totally different problem
 MSmits: up means the parent
 MSmits: you're just returning the parent
 jacek: what does left right down in tree mean oO
 MSmits: left and right i guess are siblings with a lower or higher index as seen from the parent
 Rebollo: I got a listElementsOfMyTree() function
 MSmits: down makes no sense to me, unless it's the first child node
 MSmits: it's better to use graph lingo when discussing these problems
 MSmits: l,r,u,d are really not used for graphs/trees
 MSmits: only for 2d map thingies
 MSmits: like pathfinding, bfs, floodfill etc.
 Rebollo: I use DOWN to keep track the direction...
 MSmits: yeah but what does a direction mean in your case
 MSmits: a tree is an abstract thing, it has no real direction
 MSmits: it has children, parent and sibligns
 MSmits: if you assign directions to it, it only works that way in your mind, we don't get it&#160;:)
 Rebollo: let me try to give a sample, bu I think I got what  u mean
 Rebollo: give me one minute to digest the info
 MSmits: well think of the word "root" it is the highest parent. If you draw the root as an actual tree root, it's at the bottom and the tree grows up.
 MSmits: so this already confuses up and down
 MSmits: parent and child is much more clear
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)</a>
 MSmits: (read under terminology)
 Rebollo: yes, actually its a criteria arbitrarily defined by me, where the root is UP, and the other direction is DOWN
 Rebollo: but I see what u mean
 Rebollo: let me check the WIK
 MSmits: yeah, i mean anything is fine if you code it, but as soon as you discuss with others it can cause confusion
 Rebollo: sure
 MSmits: which is ok if it happens. We have all  had that happen
 Rebollo: let me ask a conceptual question that explain why I am using UP and DOWN and you give me the right solution
 MSmits: if i can
 Rebollo: let say I got a simple tree
 Rebollo: a &gt; b &gt; c 
 Rebollo: b is a-&gt;left
 Rebollo: c is b-&gt;left
 Rebollo: Now I am creating a recursive function which receive the node as a parameter
 Rebollo: Let say I pass b as a paremeter, and want to return the next node to print
 Rebollo: How do I know if I will print
 Rebollo: a
 Rebollo: or c
 Rebollo: If I don´t know the direction it is going
 Rebollo: let say it went to C already
 Rebollo: I it is coming back
 Rebollo: or reverse
 Rebollo: that why I create a BACK, UP
 Rebollo: if UP i know the came from C
 Rebollo: if BACK iknow that came from A
 Rebollo: so a just continue the direction
 MSmits: what is left?
 Rebollo: A is the ROOTB is A-&gt;LEFTC is B-&gt;LEFT
 Rebollo: C&gt;LEFT is NULL
 Rebollo: A  &gt; B &gt; C
 Rebollo: LEFT is a pointer to another node
 Rebollo: if I am in B
 Rebollo: how do I know i I need to go to C or BACK to A?
 MSmits: yes but i still dont know what left means in the tree
 MSmits: there is no conceptual meaning to left and right in a tree
 MSmits: a parent has a list of children
 MSmits: each child may be a parent to another list of children
 Rebollo: It is a binary tree, composed by nodes:Each node has a LEFT and a RIGHT pointer
 MSmits: so there is only the parent and child relationshipo
 MSmits: so there are two children
 MSmits: always
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: each node has two children
 Rebollo: always
 MSmits: so you may as well call them A and B
 Rebollo: so I think it would make the performance better
 MSmits: or 0 and 1
 MSmits: left and right makes no difference
 Rebollo: yes
 MSmits: hmm
 Rebollo: it is just to make it easy to represent grtaphically
 Rebollo: And make it faster to find a value
 Rebollo: let say I have a value
 Rebollo: that a want to insert in the tree
 MSmits: I hope this works: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fc7c5ab-ff4c-41d5-9d50-797c382bfa48">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fc7c5ab-ff4c-41d5-9d50-797c382bfa48</a>
 MSmits: might have a syntax error in there
 Rebollo: If the value is greater than the node value I assign to left, else, I assing to the right
 MSmits: maybe also add a word
 MSmits: ok
 Rebollo: let me check
 Rebollo: I did like this
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d07d5650-6711-4def-a6ad-10a07d5e01bc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d07d5650-6711-4def-a6ad-10a07d5e01bc</a>
 Rebollo: *DATA
 Rebollo: Of course I haven´t invented the concept by my self
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/</a>
 Rebollo: bu I am trying to implement the solution
 Rebollo: wthout copying the code from anywhere
 Rebollo: once I think I undertood it
 jacek: quite a rare point of view these days
 Rebollo: And I work with a in memory data baseI use binary search in order to make my search faster..
 MSmits: Rebollo I think my approach is more general when it comes to treesearches, because the children[2] can also be children[5] or whatever
 Rebollo: So I divide the dataset by tow
 MSmits: and I point to the correct child by indexing with 0 or 1
 MSmits: children[0] or children[1]
 MSmits: i dont usually work with binary trees, usually they are trees from boardgames which have a branching that's larger
 Rebollo: So I divide the dataset by two till I find the record
 Rebollo: instead of full scan the table
 MSmits: yeah that's a binary search
 MSmits: do you use this for a cg puzzle?
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: I am trying
 Rebollo: The resistance
 Rebollo: But I am more intersted in learning
 Rebollo: than resolving
 Rebollo: But eventually I will get there
 Rebollo: But if you have some direction to give about it
 Rebollo: I will be more than happy to here
 Rebollo: hear*
 Rebollo: And I am totally new to c++
 Rebollo: So I am learning from scracth
 Rebollo: Althoug I have some concepts of OO
 Rebollo: But C++ seems to be the most powerfull language
 Rebollo: And I would love to learn
 jacek: or rust :unamused:
 MSmits: the resistance puzzle? 
 MSmits: it's better to link it here
 MSmits: so we dont have to find it

 MSmits: ohh it's classified as very hard lol
 Rebollo: I got one very hard already
 MSmits: i really would not recommend very hard puzzles if you're still learning about trees
 MSmits: not saying you cant do it
 MSmits: but it seems inefficient way to learn
 Rebollo: I don´t think so
 Rebollo: Although I was able to finish the puzzle I learned about classes
 Rebollo: Variable types
 Rebollo: arrays
 Rebollo: pointers
 Rebollo: maps
 Rebollo: in about two weeks
 Rebollo: And I am like not smart
 Rebollo: opossite
 Rebollo: but I like it
 Rebollo: I am persistent
 MSmits: I guess if it motivates you it's fine, but if it leads you to being stuck too long, it could be inefficient
 MSmits: i havent solved this particular puzzle myself
 Rebollo: I solved this very hard

 MSmits: well if you've done that one, you should be good with binary search
 MSmits: by the way, are you particularly attached to c++&#160;?
 Rebollo: What do you mean?
 MSmits: because it's definitely not the quickest language to code puzzle solutions in
 MSmits: it's runs quick, but your coding is much slower than in most other languages
 Rebollo: Ahh no..
 Rebollo: But I think it is the best one for learning
 Rebollo: Like
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: I learned in C#
 Rebollo: I hate do array.sort()
 Rebollo: I dont know what is happening
 MSmits: i guess it depends on what you're wanting to learn
 Rebollo: I am trying to learning logic in general
 Rebollo: any kind
 MSmits: if you use a higher language and you know what the parts do, you can use the parts to more quickly do higher order logic
 MSmits: and you dont spend too much time on the basics
 Rebollo: for example javascript has everything done..
 Rebollo: split
 Rebollo: sort
 Rebollo: push
 MSmits: javascript is a horrible language, dont compare with that :P
 Rebollo: drop
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: there is a nice 1-line solution in Haskell
 Rebollo: python is greate I know..but I don´t get use to its sintaxe
 Rebollo: You can solve a problem in only line
 MSmits: doesnt have to be python though. C# is fine too, if you dont mind working in a MS language
 jacek: or java
 Rebollo: And after that nobody is going to understand what is going one there
 MSmits: it looks like C++, but you dont get stuck on silly bugs forever
 struct: stl has lots of features aswell
 MSmits: stl?
 Rebollo: I use c# in UNITY games development
 Rebollo: But you
 struct: standard template library
 jacek: standard something someting
 Rebollo: It is hard
 MSmits: C# is hard?
 MSmits: seems a lot easier than C++ to me
 MSmits: i used C# in unity as well and in other places
 Rebollo: For me everything related to coding is hard, aand takes lot of effort to learn..The coding process it self is hard
 Rebollo: I can to anything
 Rebollo: but takes a lot of time
 MSmits: but if you use visual studio, C# has a very good IDE to work in
 Rebollo: But once a like it
 Rebollo: I dont care
 Rebollo: I used to use Visual Studio for cv sharp
 Rebollo: is it possible to share a video of the game I am creating here?
 MSmits: ehh if you youtube it or something
 MSmits: for images, imgur works
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8K9u6tEr9c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8K9u6tEr9c</a>
 Rebollo: Doing it from scracth
 Rebollo: doing everything
 Rebollo: the character
 Rebollo: movements
 Rebollo: everything
 MSmits: looks cool
 Rebollo: I took like
 Rebollo: 3 months
 Rebollo: And this is the only thing I got
 Rebollo: for now
 Rebollo: But for example
 Rebollo: You see the bugs circular movements?
 Rebollo: the Bee
 struct: yes
 Rebollo: I spent like a week, like undertand the sin function
 jacek: everyone sin
 MSmits: yeah I can see how that could be problematic
 MSmits: I started coding after learning the math
 struct: 3 months doesnt seem like a lot
 struct: since you are learning stuff on the way
 MSmits: yeah if you still need to learn math then its not much at all
 struct: maybe now with your current knowledge it would take you less than 1 month
 Rebollo: but  working really hard
 Rebollo: I am married have kids I so on
 MSmits: it helps to do tutorials
 Rebollo: I have a full time job
 MSmits: if you like unity, then this is super enjoyable: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/">https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/</a>
 Rebollo: so it is not easy
 Rebollo: I touch about developing a game after I have played Hollow Knight
 Rebollo: do you guys know?
 MSmits: nope
 struct: heard the name
 struct: never played it
 Rebollo: The best game I have ever played
 Rebollo: indie game
 Rebollo: basically developed but two guys
 Rebollo: And what they did are incredble
 Rebollo: By the way Hollow Knight 2 will be released this year
 Rebollo: It is incredible 
 MSmits: gotta go Rebollo, but want to give you 1 piece of advice if you're going to keep learnng
 MSmits: efficient learning is a trade-off between:1) Doing actual meaningful projects (challenges) that keep you motivated.2) Doing things in order of increasing difficulty, so you can keep going. 
 MSmits: If you do too much of 1, you can waste a lot of time being stuck. if you do too much of 2, then you might lose motivation.  
 MSmits: tutorials are part of 2, you're not overcoming challenges, but you learn very fast
 Rebollo: Thanks you sr. for the advice.. I certainly will take them into account..  
 MSmits: np, have fun and ttyl
 jacek: Automaton2000 what day is it
 Automaton2000: i get a job as a software developer
 jacek: good for you
 YanniD: Thanks @Msmits
 jacek: :thinking:
 Majeck: Can somebody send me the herokuapp for finding clashes
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Majeck: Thanks
 Rebollo: Guys, stupid question
 Rebollo: How do I run a c++ (cpp) program withoutVisual Studio?
 Rebollo: Like I am using Visual Studio Code
 Rebollo: I am tired of using this CG IDE
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: cabbage and goat potw
 Rebollo: worked
 Rebollo: thanks mrs..
 Wontonimo: hi
 Wontonimo: o.m.g.&#160;!  I got puzzle of the week :D
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: a trick to get you to work more :P
 Wontonimo: it's working
 Be-Ugeen: can somebody tell me what's wrong here?python code:result = sum(int(x*y) for x,y in zip(a,b) 
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cc1c47e-3cef-48bb-a689-53d095773a47">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cc1c47e-3cef-48bb-a689-53d095773a47</a>
 vdtdg: tryresult = sum([int(x*y) for x,y in zip(a,b)]) 
 Wontonimo: ^^ Be-Ugeen
 Be-Ugeen: thanks to all
 vdtdg: See "list comprehension Python" on Google for further understanding
 Wontonimo: hey vdtdg , you don't the need the [] when it is in () already.
 vdtdg: Ah yeah you're right, then it's just the missing parenthesis
 Wontonimo: honestly, I've been coding Python for 6 years and only learnt that a month ago
 Be-Ugeen: :joy:
 Be-Ugeen: does anybody solved "1000000000D WORLD"?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 vdtdg: Ah it looks fun
 Be-Ugeen: i hate it :rage:
 Wontonimo: what?
 Wontonimo: let's say you have
 Wontonimo: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 *3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4
 Wontonimo: then it can be broken down into1*3 *3 + 1*4 *1 + 2*4 *5
 Wontonimo: no need to expand
 Wontonimo: the example
 Wontonimo: 500000001 1 499999999 -11000000000 1
 Be-Ugeen: but the list ist already compressed
 glyphi208: nice
 Wontonimo: is 500000001*(1*1) + 499999999*(1*-1)
 Be-Ugeen: what is happen with that thing 1000000000 1
 Wontonimo: 1000000000 1 becomes
 Wontonimo: 500000001 1 499999999 1
 Wontonimo: and therefore becomes easy to multiply with500000001 1 499999999 -1
 vdtdg: What you can do is to transform the second vector (b) so that it matches your first vector (a) so it's easy to perform the operation Wontonimo showed
 Be-Ugeen: 500000001*(1*1) + 499999999*(1*-1)is that correct when transform it into the indexes?a0*(b1*a1) + a2*(b1*a3)
 Dren: they are not exclusive
 ASM_MOV_INT: yes
 ASM_MOV_INT: the clash-insanity of it all
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: doing private clashes on twitch is fun, but those seem to have died out
 C26_1: I know how to know if a puzzle can be used in reverse mode
 C26_1: If i know the input and the output, can you guest the statement
 C26_1: If yes then the puzzle can be reversed
 C26_1: else it's not
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: what is your point?
 C26_1: Sharing my idea
 C26_1: For example
 C26_1: This is my input
 C26_1: 2 3 38 10 05 3 4
 C26_1: This is my output
 C26_1: 6
 C26_1: Can you guest the statement?
 C26_1: Wait sorry
 C26_1: This is true input:3 2 38 10 05 3 4
 C26_1: And the output is the same
 C26_1: That other one is false
 Thorcode: dude pls make a contribution
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: It'll insanely hard to explain
 Mortis_666: u dont need to
 Thorcode: just make one then I will consider
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: People hate reverses they can't figure out.  I try to make it so 85% of them can figure out in 1 minute

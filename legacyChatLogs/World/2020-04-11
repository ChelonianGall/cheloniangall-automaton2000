 jacek: happy Caturday
 dbdr: happy Raturday
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i got beaten up during the night&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and someone gave 1 star to jacek's paper soccer
 dbdr: monitoring multi ratings eulerscheZahl?
 dbdr: who's beating you up?
 eulerscheZahl: from time to time. several games were downvoted
 struct: yeah&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: legend is beating me up
 struct: I wonder if I even should finish yinsh tbh
 struct: so many multies now
 struct: even on pending list
 struct: is  like 4
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, impressive
 eulerscheZahl: moderating them is quite some effort
 struct: especially during contest
 eulerscheZahl: did anyone try codejam last night?
 struct: No&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: me neither, i decided to sleep
 struct: has yurkov joined ooc long ago?
 struct: only saw him now
 eulerscheZahl: i think i saw him before

 struct: he is top 50 now
 dbdr: that URL pings me :D
 eulerscheZahl: guess how i feel with my github and herokuapp
 dbdr: :nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: i can even ping myself when i have multiple tabs open
 dbdr: do they come up often?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, when i share them :D
 dbdr: :D
 struct: dbdr you store leaderboards everyday?
 dbdr: yes
 struct: Now just need a website to choose dates and contest
 dbdr: sure, this is the raw data, not user friendly
 eulerscheZahl: there was such a website from adrien
 dbdr: though github does a decent job of displaying tsv as a table
 eulerscheZahl: but he stopped indexing
 struct: Good job displaying yes
 struct: but navigating is a bit meh
 dbdr: I think it's the right architecture, separate the data from the visualization
 dbdr: sure, it's not built for that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/">https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/</a>
 dbdr: before the ranking v2?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, old one
 eulerscheZahl: but it tracked your contest rating every 2h
 dbdr: anyone could build a visualization on top of the github data, any good frontender?
 eulerscheZahl: helped finding the "good one" again :D
 dbdr: with agentid?
 eulerscheZahl: your github data is 16 day old
 dbdr: not anymore
 eulerscheZahl: yes, agentId in the tooltips
 dbdr: only the push is not automated yet
 dbdr: should do it
 eulerscheZahl: afk breakfast
 struct: you want to just display leaderboard and navigation
 struct: or something else?
 dbdr: struct: a lot of things could be done with this data I think
 struct: yeah
 dbdr: just display the lb is fine but already on CG
 dbdr: but graphing over time
 struct: Can also check last agent id
 dbdr: dayly/weekly/month changes, ...
 struct: and see what changed
 dbdr: right
 kovi: uh, variance is still high
 Marcose: anyone?
 dbdr: kovi same or a bit less?
 kovi: same code 7th and now 1st (3points diff)
 dbdr: at least there's more spread in points
 struct: I havent used javascript in a while
 struct: but i can give it a try
 dbdr: if you feel like it, very cool struct!
 eulerscheZahl: but don't forget about the contest
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want you to delete your account again
 struct: Im not doing the contest&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: you said legend or delete
 struct: :sweat:
 kovi: legend and delete username is already taken. "not doing the contest" is accessible

 dbdr: shows 30.73 for me. wonder where that number comes from
 eulerscheZahl: gold
 dbdr: looks like it
 dbdr: but it gold it was updating
 eulerscheZahl: that's your old bot
 dbdr: they keep one score per league?
 dbdr: forever?
 eulerscheZahl: you need a replay with your most recent agent id
 eulerscheZahl: the score will remain the same, it doesn't show a rank for old replays
 dbdr: they keep the score of all agents?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: whatever for?
 eulerscheZahl: bots are bound to an agent id, not to a user
 dbdr: but past bots will never be shown
 dbdr: keeping the source I understand
 eulerscheZahl: fun fact: you can manually set the agent id of your opponent. and then play against kovis tower defense bot in OOC and make him believe that he's crashing :D
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: build a universal bot
 dbdr: detect which game it is playing based on the input
 kovi:&#160;:)
 dbdr: fit it in 100K too ...
 eulerscheZahl: oh, kovi saw my idea now&#160;:(
 dbdr: the meta multi
 eulerscheZahl: well, still some other users to fool
 dbdr: we should definitely build it
 kovi: the ultimate leaderboard
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: oh, eulerscheZahl has a trick, need to reverse it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: what trick?
 dbdr: "kovi saw my idea"
 dbdr: I thought that meant you implemented a cheese
 eulerscheZahl: no, the bot from another game
 dbdr: ah right
 dbdr: hum, we will need to build a meta referee too
 dbdr: any size limit?
 eulerscheZahl: 10MB
 eulerscheZahl: including graphics
 dbdr: just copy all the referee in one and rand() to pick the game first&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and downscale the graphics
 dbdr: yeah, worth it
 dbdr: the variance on that metamulti :D
 dbdr: yeah, I got lucky, playing PCR in this match
 kovi: there are generic solvers...eg. one smitsimax with game specific  eval
 eulerscheZahl: will we tell players which game they play? or do they have to reverse the input format?
 dbdr: right, a good motivation to factor some generic code
 kovi: yeah reverse
 dbdr: reverse
 dbdr: more fun
 dbdr: some might be amgiguous
 dbdr: need to play both for some time
 dbdr: inspired by OOC
 dbdr: uncertainty to the next level
 eulerscheZahl: isn't aCat working on that kind of generic bots?
 dbdr: ah, can we send the referee source code as the first input?&#160;;)
 kovi: yeah, i remember he talked about that at locam
 dbdr: yavalath is part of a generic game framework I think
 dbdr: where the rules are data
 jacek: ludi?
 dbdr: yeah that one
 jacek: youre talking about implementing general game playing?
 dbdr: not general, just all the CG multis
 eulerscheZahl: with regular updates to add new games
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: keep up or you will timeout more
 navin89098909890: Hi
 dbdr: a wait bot in everything would probably do quite well&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: just don't crash
 dbdr: xactly

 dbdr: *call
 AntiSquid: hi navin89098909890 join the contest
 Neozero: I fcking did it Hahahaha
 Neozero: :D
 Nerchio: guys before i fell asleep yesterday I had a very important question pop in my mind
 Neozero: I beat the TAN Network finally
 Nerchio: in terms of strategy what is better - to start in the middle or on the outside in the ooc
 eulerscheZahl: in the largest lake
 Nerchio: that narrows it down for sure :D
 AntiSquid: is there any reason pragmas could cause bugs? (C++) deactivating them makes my bot run just fine&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: #pragma GCC optimize "O3,mavx2,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"
 eulerscheZahl: the optim level might reveal existing bugs like not properly initialized variables
 eulerscheZahl: memory layout might change too. so an index out of range for an array can have different behaviour
 AntiSquid: are some bugs probably caused by lack of memory, doubt i reached the limit, but who knows
 AntiSquid: any way to check how much i use from the total&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: seems unlikely to me
 AntiSquid: ok will check my variables then, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: google, sorry i don't know it either
 kovi: what euler said. +add bunch of logs and run the same code with/wo. check difference
 pb4: AntiSquid&#160;: like eulerscheZahl said, O3 will not initialize variables to 0 by default
 pb4: O0 will
 pb4: hence some bugs appear with O3 only
 AntiSquid: i use array_something = {0} to initialize
 wlesavo: im trying to use java cg benchmark, the login is successful and after trying to start a game im getting this error  [    wlesavo ][   SEED 0 ] ERROR internal error
 wlesavo: can you advice what is wrong?
 AntiSquid: which seed are you using
 dbdr: wlesavo can you get the stack trace of the error? might put in the  right direction
 wlesavo: seed was random, but with list getting the same error
 wlesavo: stack trace?
 dbdr: "internal error" is a terrible message. should give some info about what went wrong and where
 wlesavo: oh, maybe its because i use precompiled jar, ill try to rebuild, and then probably will comeback :slight_smile:
 dbdr: does not sound likely to me
 dbdr: maybe there's a configuration about how verbose the logs are?
 dbdr: sorry I don't use cgbenchmark so I don't kno the specifics
 wlesavo: hm
 AntiSquid: did you use correct agentID&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i could send you my configuration file, if i find it, not sure where i placed it @_@
 wlesavo: ok, it was due to space in Python 3, nwm :slight_smile:
 Nagatwin: Antisquit I had an issue when using a pragma on my dfs, still haven't investigated why
 Nagatwin: AntiSquid *
 AntiSquid: well i found out the bug is related to eliminating possible enemy positions after torpedo shots
 AntiSquid: i don't clean up the positions properly somewhere ... so it tries to access indexes it shouldn't 
 Nagatwin: uh rip
 Nagatwin: xD
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447931600">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447931600</a>
 Nagatwin: "steering" stuff isn't for me i guess
 YannT: ahah you made the default stub AI so much worse :D
 dbdr: playing the same person several times in the first ten
 dbdr: CG matchup algorithm could be improved...
 AntiSquid: finally \o/
 AntiSquid: too many variables Q_Q
 dbdr: what did you achieve AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: i can correctly eliminate positions based on damage/explosions
 dbdr: nice
 eulerscheZahl: does that include path backtracking for mine placements on TRIGGER?
 dbdr: "based on damage/explosions"
 AntiSquid: no, just torpedo, but the new bot will have the trigger bit as well
 dbdr: not part of the requirements&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: TRIGGER is an explosion too
 AntiSquid: with the current arena bot i cut a lot of corners and do some very superficial checks
 dbdr: true
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan lat me win C# for once&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: but will add mines too
 Illedan: No.
 AntiSquid: just get 1st place in contest euler, problem solved
 Nagatwin: ah
 Nagatwin: thats the 3v
 eulerscheZahl: exactly :D
 Nagatwin: rofl
 eulerscheZahl: now you have the secret algo for gold
 Nagatwin: yay
 Nagatwin: finally unlicked the full statement
 eulerscheZahl: you can still lick the max thrust, will be 200 in legend
 Nagatwin: unlocked
 dbdr: be careful what you lick these days
 Nagatwin: tuning the thrust is enough gor legend&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Nagatwin: oh
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote a sim in bronze, had to rewrite for changed gold input
 Nagatwin: ye
 eulerscheZahl: completely killed my motivation for that game
 Nagatwin: thats why I wanted to get that strat before writing anything
 JasonTruter: How do I use my sonar?
 Nagatwin: SONAR 5
 Nagatwin: replace 5 by the sector you want
 AntiSquid: Nagatwin you could tweak speed / angle turning point variables for legend
 Nagatwin: angle turning points&#160;? :o
 eulerscheZahl: did you give up on OOC Nagatwin?
 AntiSquid: and have a blocker pod and one runner pod
 JasonTruter: What is a sector?
 AntiSquid: the big 5x5 squares
 eulerscheZahl: watch a replay JasonTruterdo you see these numbers in the squares?
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl can't get that code any higher, I have to write a full sim and i'm not godd enough at these thing
 Nagatwin: good
 AntiSquid: you can get legend without sim
 eulerscheZahl: he did
 Nagatwin: im legend
 AntiSquid: ah nvm
 dbdr: in OOC
 Nagatwin: I really have no idea on how to write a good simu, especially with several actions in the same turn
 Nagatwin: So far I have a small path simu and killmove simu
 eulerscheZahl: and the incomplete information
 Nagatwin: thats not my issue eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: you got legend in OOC without sim?
 Nagatwin: Yeah
 AntiSquid: wow . what did you use lol
 Nagatwin: good pathfinding
 dbdr: LeChuck is not simming either I think
 AntiSquid: that's it&#160;?
 Nagatwin: killing simu
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447873049">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447873049</a>val growth has a kill avoidance at frame 59
 Nagatwin: like if hp &lt; 4, I kill
 JasonTruter: so an example of a sonar would be the following "MOVE N | SONAR 5"?
 Nagatwin: and perfect detection AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: jeez ... and i am now writing a sim to get to legend, maybe i should tweak my if-else instead?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah but you can still charge in your MOVE JasonTruter
 JasonTruter: charge?
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE N TORPEDO | SONAR 5
 JasonTruter: I see, for some reason my sonar result comes back as NA and cooldown still -1
 JasonTruter: and breaks
 eulerscheZahl: -1 means that it's not unlocked in your league
 eulerscheZahl: are you in wood2?
 JasonTruter: yes
 Nagatwin: AntiSquid Idk haha I still have a lot involved on my pathfinding that makes it a simu partially. But I only assume I do 1 move per turn (thats why I always silence 1 distance)
 JasonTruter: I've got basic movement down, where it decides on moves based off islands and visited right now
 Nagatwin: AntiSquid and torpedo/mine are not any part of the pathfinding
 eulerscheZahl: not always Nagatwin <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/zHjgB2X">https://imgur.com/a/zHjgB2X</a>
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl that's the killing move
 Nagatwin: but yeah I agree, I sometimes use silence 4 to kill the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: you always go by 4 on killing?
 eulerscheZahl: no 2 or 3?
 Nagatwin: and the next line is return 0;
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl 0 to 4
 Nagatwin: the simu is complete for the killing move
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i need more replays of your bot then
 eulerscheZahl: only analyzed 22
 Nagatwin: trigger and torpedo included
 dbdr: Nagatwin return 0 that's confident, nice&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: dbdr haha yes
 dbdr: I'm done here :D
 Nagatwin: when I do that I do not compute any update on my paths
 dbdr: saves CPU cycles
 Nagatwin: So if I do not kill with this part, my bot would be screwed up
 Nagatwin: so yeah just return 0 for debugging
 dbdr: that's good. better to crash and investigate than hide the issue
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2cc8888f-65c3-46dc-9a65-be87d9a4fe99">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2cc8888f-65c3-46dc-9a65-be87d9a4fe99</a>
 Nagatwin: inside 8 nested for loops :p
 dbdr: :upside_down:
 eulerscheZahl: my software engineering prof would hate you
 dbdr: that's why it does not scale to a sim
 Nagatwin: I have no sanity checks for my path arrays :p
 dbdr: you just sim a special case
 Nagatwin: Yes
 Nagatwin: But sims are slows as fuck
 dbdr: does not have to be
 Nagatwin: I couldn't manage to simulate several turns with this game
 dbdr: essentially the same work as your  8 loops
 Nagatwin: With a proper one, not the bruteforcing i'm doing fot the killing move
 dbdr: right, if you go deeper there is more work, exponentially
 Nagatwin: essentially sampling some moves for each turn and applying them 
 Nagatwin: But the update of my possible paths killed the simu count
 Nagatwin: Otherwise I could make a simu without considering the possible paths at the end but that seem wrong for this game
 Nagatwin: and it basically is the same as my current pathfinding part
 JasonTruter: Wouldn't you need sonar to detect within the path?
 JasonTruter: So you can't really use BFS or DFS as it would be required that you visit the node?
 JasonTruter: and then go back to the root node, unless you surface everytime you need to go back
 Nagatwin: I did that on my first version
 JasonTruter: Not very efficient?
 Nagatwin: randomized dfs, take the deepest branch as base path and then add some path length using heuristics on 2x2 blocs
 Nagatwin: JasonTruter that's a way to fill an area
 JasonTruter: Yeah, I'm considering finding the quickest path between each sector
 Nagatwin: but let's say that we have to consider more short-term pathing strategy for legend that involve aescaping mines, ...
 JasonTruter: to use my sonar on each sector
 Nagatwin: I'm not sure to understand what you mean
 Nagatwin: sonar is supposed to tell you if the opponent is in a given sector
 JasonTruter: I'm on wood 2, what would the minimum I need to do right now be?
 Nagatwin: start on a place with water
 JasonTruter: Yeah I've done that
 Nagatwin: and move around without going into islands/visited cells
 Nagatwin: when you are out of visited cells, you can surface
 Nagatwin: generating a long path is up to you
 JasonTruter: Yeah so I've done that too except for surfacing when no possible moves left
 JasonTruter: So how would I get to the next league?
 Nagatwin: If you have a path long enough and ensure you are not producting invalid moves, you should be able to get to wood 1
 JasonTruter: I'm in wood 2
 Nagatwin: I know
 Nagatwin: when you reach rank 1 in wood 2 you get promoted to wood 1
 Nagatwin: Otherwise you can try using  torpedos randomly, this may touch your opponent
 SabertheLost: my algo sucks&#160;:) it only fins the furthest point, but does not take into consideration what it might block&#160;;)
 SabertheLost: finds*
 JasonTruter: Whats a MSG?
 Nagatwin: MSG is something you display each turn
 SabertheLost: as in message I think
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447962016">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447962016</a>
 Scarfield: for debugging or silly comments
 Nagatwin: here below my nickname you can see the message I display each turn
 JasonTruter: Oh okay cool
 MadJetski_58cc: nice
 SabertheLost: Ok, so I changed from BFS to DFS, then limited to 50 steps. I went from rank 240 to rank 16 in wood 2 with only moving...
 SabertheLost: ok rank 3 now.
 JasonTruter: where do you see rank
 SabertheLost: At the top, where you see the league your in and time left.
 SabertheLost: ok, i´m actully in wood 1 not 2.
 SabertheLost: And there i will be promoted by only moving?
 jrke: guys i am in eight standard i dint know trignometry can you help me for coders strike back gold league that how to find angle in it
 jrke: please
 jrke: :pray:

 blasterpoard: jrke <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry</a> should be a good source
 jrke: can you tell me which function to use
 blasterpoard: nope
 jrke: like acos
 jrke: asin
 tranculent: are we supposed to handle initial "Invalid coordinates" somehow?
 jrke: or atan2
 blasterpoard: jrke it's explained in there
 jrke: ok
 blasterpoard: which function is used for what
 tranculent: to find an angle, I use Acos @jrke
 jrke: ok
 Scarfield: take note that the angle input of your pods are measured differently than the standard for sin/cos calculations. and the coordinate system has y axis inverted as well
 SabertheLost: rank 68 in bronze, maybe time to start using mines or torpedoes
 SabertheLost: 43 now

 MadKnight: ezpz
 ThienPhu: give
 MadKnight: what
 AntiSquid: kick
 kovi: top4 is balanced
 Illedan: Let's try to fix that :P
 Famout: Guh, been far too long since I did stuff with actual pathfinding. Once this is ready to run though it's gonna be fun seeing how much I have mucked it up. 
 Famout: And forgot 2D arrays don't like to be passed without their size fixed in stone.. Anyone know if the Ocean of Code challenge ever changes the map size? 
 Counterbalance: it's constant
 Famout: That's great, used to lots of things changing in a challenge and was keeping size flexible, that makes it a lot easier. 
 Counterbalance: whoops <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/448038500">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/448038500</a>
 eulerscheZahl: scared of mines? my bot does the same nonsense&#160;:(
 Famout: The fact the mine blew up and he still didn't leave I think was the larger issue, big fish small pond.
 Counterbalance: still too many possible mine locations.. Pre detonation:

 Famout: Ah, fair enough, fear is the sub killer after all.
 Nerchio: time to add mines to my bot :D
 Famout: Moment of truth, time to see if I correctly coded full map pathfinding correctly the first time. 
 Nerchio: probably not :D
 Famout: The fact it just ran into an Island tells me no....
 Famout: Huh, bugs in brand new untested code. strange
 Famout: On the plus side, it did move at least. 
 Nerchio: is there a better way of checking your 8 neighbouring squares than 8 ifs?
 NormantasStankevicius: wdym?
 NormantasStankevicius: 8?
 Nerchio: when you are at 5,5 you have 8 squares around you
 Nerchio: or wherever else
 Valdemar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e32e889-f42e-4296-9a38-866005493d80">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e32e889-f42e-4296-9a38-866005493d80</a>
 NormantasStankevicius: well, if you need to check
 NormantasStankevicius: if something is at range
 NormantasStankevicius: you can do some range calculations
 NormantasStankevicius: let's say
 NormantasStankevicius: if I target cordinate is in those squares around me
 Nerchio: valdemar its a vector?
 Nerchio: i will be checking how many island squares there are around x,y
 Nerchio: i want my mines to be placed with maximum area open
 Nerchio: its simple
 Valdemar: vec2i is x,y structure
 Nerchio: but i am asking if there is anything better or nicer looking than 8 ifs
 Nerchio: i am writing in java 
 Valdemar: idea is to use array of shifts
 JasonTruter: Whats the benefit of using different traversals in DFS?
 Famout: Hmmm, the response time of 50ms might be an issue...
 Famout: Great, I kinda need to check how much can be done in that time, to see just how badly I am going over it. 
 Counterbalance: what language, Famout?
 Famout: c++ 
 Counterbalance: do you have the pragma?
 Famout: I have never done anything with that before. 
 Counterbalance: put this at the first line of your source file:
 Counterbalance: that'll turn on compiler optimisations so it will run 10x faster or so.
 Famout: Ah, that's why! Used to Visual studio where I handle all that stuff via the GUI 
 Famout: Many thanks
 D4yBr3ak: ofast = o3&#160;?
 Counterbalance: O2
 Counterbalance: more or less
 D4yBr3ak: does it work for C too&#160;?
 Counterbalance: It should, yes
 D4yBr3ak: thank you
 Famout: OK, much improved, got to turn 115, before I tried to doubleback for some reason. 
 Famout: Admittedly did have to also put a limiter on the pathfinding, but I think part of that is some nodes doubling up over themselves. 
 Famout: Huh, it doesn't seem to be respecting the closed node list, that would screw things up alright. 
 Counterbalance: What are you using the DFS for?
 JasonTruter: Pathfinding
 Nerchio: i use bfs for targeting
 kovi: nice illedan. not top4, but definitely closer
 AntiSquid: how much rock-paper-scissors is there in legend kovi?
 Illedan: Thx, let's see how we can fix that&#160;;)
 kovi: antisquid, there is definitely some
 kovi: but most of the time i cant tell the reason
 NormantasStankevicius: I was around 116th in wood1, left wood and played the same code, and now in 5th/300~ in bronze
 YannT: I can't figure out why I consistently have bad winrates against some bots and good ones against others
 YannT: there's seemingly no strategy difference or whatever
 kovi: yeah. even though i cant tell what is under the hood
 revo1: it's works but what the hill is this game
 Famout: Something is off with my code still.... but not crashing, and just won twice agaisnt the test bot... and I am way overdue for bed.
 Famout: Screw it SUBMIT
 Famout: Zero surprise, so far beating folks who run into islands/off the board....
 Ran_42: can someone help me with python binascii
 MadKnight: what's the problem&#160;?
 Ran_42: i dont understand how to convert a ascii to binary

 Ran_42: it converts to something weird
 MadKnight: ord('x') returns u the code of a char
 AntiSquid: that's what i do
 Ran_42: i did google it
 MadKnight: then subtract ord('a') from it
 MadKnight: and u will get the alphabetical index of x
 AntiSquid: ah wait you mean the chuck norris puzzle?
 Ran_42: ye
 <b>**Famout thinks making a passive aggressive sub that takes 600+ turns to win might be making the test battles take some time. </b></p><p><img src="/a/29443769474274" /> MadKnight: then convert to binary
 MadKnight: index
 Ran_42: it convert to this b'\x00\x00
 Ran_42: instead of 0s and 1s
 MadKnight: \x00 == 0
 MadKnight: \x01 == 1
 AntiSquid: build an array of 7 chars or something and then convert that
 MadKnight: just replace this stuff
 Ran_42: but everything is 0 then its worng
 MadKnight: but it feels like u did something wrong
 MadKnight: show your code
 Ran_42: ye probably
 JasonTruter: How do I progress to wood 1? I've got movement going where it resets surface when theres no other moves.
 Ran_42: message = input()message = b.a2b_uu(message)
 Ran_42: this too import binascii as b
 AntiSquid: JasonTruter you need to track opponent and shoot them
 Famout: JasonTruter or have REALLY good movement, a mix of both would be best. 
 MadKnight: no u used the wrong thing
 MadKnight: u gotta convert ord(message[i]) to binary
 AntiSquid: also use bfs to save some space when going around the map so you surface less and then you definitely get wood 2 JasonTruter
 JasonTruter: I'm on wood 2 right now
 AntiSquid: i mean wood 1
 JasonTruter: cool
 JasonTruter: Going to start by firing aimlessly
 AntiSquid: no
 Nerchio: everybody has different tips haha
 AntiSquid: that's a bad idea
 Famout: I did a bit of overkill and set up pathfinding to dig out a path that uses most of the screen before surfacing, no code for firing torps
 JasonTruter: Is it
 Nerchio: i did random shooting and random movement until bronze i think
 AntiSquid: save shots for when the opponent location is known
 Ran_42: thanks mad knight i got one more question
 Famout: With %50 of the battles done, it is ranking me above the king bot. 
 Ran_42: why does it says 0b100... instead of 100...?
 AntiSquid: Nerchio the must have overnerfed the bosses then or you submitted when the boss was broken first hour or so&#160;?
 JasonTruter: So for pathfinding maybe use dfs so that Its faster to get to my opponent?
 AntiSquid: whatever you like
 JasonTruter: As BFS can take quite some time, I'll use dfs once I know location
 Nerchio: no i mean random shooting and when you hit something then it narrows down their position :D
 Counterbalance: bfs can be much faster than dfs
 AntiSquid: that's a different story Nerchio
 JasonTruter: bfs would search through layers, that would take longer?
 JasonTruter: I guess I could slowly move toward my opponent with bfs
 Counterbalance: you only visit each node once in bfs
 JasonTruter: This game really got me working on algorithms lol, I normally work with high level code
 AntiSquid: have a function with bfs and one with dfs and switch your bot to use either as you see necessary, you will then find out what's best
 JasonTruter: for building webapps etc
 Famout: Oh wow, only now I discovered I screwed up using rand and picking my spawn point. 
 Famout: Also, woo! Wood1
 AntiSquid: which languages JasonTruter?
 JasonTruter: Writing in Java right now, but I write in python and javascript at work
 JasonTruter: Do alot of AWS stuff
 AntiSquid: nice
 AntiSquid: why don't you get an avatar?
 JasonTruter: I should hey
 JasonTruter: This game has got me hooked right now
 AntiSquid: the ranks on the leaderboard are like ocean waves, back and forth :D
 AntiSquid: going *
 Nerchio: for me its more like a sinking ship but okay
 NormantasStankevicius: okay, my wood1 code put my in silver
 JasonTruter: Don't know why my torpedo isn't firing
 AntiSquid: check the console log in bottom left JasonTruter
 Nerchio: this gold bot with MSG FATALITY is so annoying :D
 JasonTruter: Torpedo is working
 MadKnight: hey guys
 MadKnight: are there any websites for artists where they can find a contract job&#160;?
 Famout: OK then, added in extremely limited use of silence, lets see how well I do in wood 2
 Famout: wood 1*
 Nerchio: damn this gold bot is really good
 eulerscheZahl: reaching legend is never easy
 eulerscheZahl: except for Tron
 Famout: Yep, bedtime now, but managed to reach rank 50 on wood 2 with just a pathfinding bot, good seafairing! 
 Famout: wood1 dangit!
 Nerchio: i guess i will submit and see how i do vs others i dont win too much vs this bot
 Famout: Ah, wow, 50 outta 596, feeds good
 JasonTruter: How would you know if opponent surfaced?
 Counterbalance: it's given in the input
 JasonTruter: sonarresult?
 Counterbalance: the one after that
 Counterbalance: line 3, opponentOrders
 JasonTruter: Ah ok, thanks!
 kovi: wow, almost 30, got pushed up
 AntiSquid: with great power come great bugs!
 JasonTruter: so true
 JasonTruter: Fixed up all my bugs now
 JasonTruter: Won with just movement&#160;:)
 JasonTruter: But only ranked 300 lol
 JasonTruter: need to improve
 AntiSquid: anyone has a seed with almost no islands? please
 Quidome: 0?
 AntiSquid: 0 or close to 0, either
 blasterpoard: seed=-430391657 AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: thx
 Nerchio: haha
 Nerchio: opponent bot broke when i hit hit with torpedo and he used surface  5 times
 Nerchio: so funny
 JasonTruter: how would I use bfs without having to surface to get back to the root node
 Swagboy: Why do you want to get back&#160;?
 Swagboy: If so, that's np hard i'd say
 AndrejVelichkovski: @JasonTruter can you write the whole thing you are trying to do with bfs?
 jrke: any suggetion  coders strike gold league how to find angle
 JasonTruter: trig
 Uljahn: atan2
 jrke: can u tell me algo
 jrke: because i am in 8th standard so i didn't learn trig
 jrke: plz
 Uljahn: jeez, just go play fortnite
 jrke: plz tell me
 Astrobytes: plz google it
 jrke: i can't understand it
 Astrobytes: Fix it
 jrke: please just tell me how to use and where to use
 Astrobytes: No. You should try to learn.
 AndrejVelichkovski: the thing is, if they tell you, you won't learn anything
 AntiSquid: that's more than a line in chat worth of learning material
 jrke: ok 
 jrke: you are right
 jrke: i will learn
 AntiSquid: no, he will learn, but the chat is too small for that kind of classroom
 jrke: thanks
 AntiSquid: i would suggest playing a grid based game instead, no trigonometry
 jrke: ok
 Nerchio: I just realised that triggering mines gives out a lot of information as well
 Nerchio: if your enemies can track it well
 Counterbalance: yup
 Nerchio: they can remove all the possible positions that weren't there at that time to place the mine at X Y
 AntiSquid: ya but if you spin in circles and lay a mine in a similar rea?
 AntiSquid: area *
 Nerchio: you can remove some not all :P
 JasonTruter: I have to rewrite my movement&#160;:(
 Quidome: Zenoscave, are you online?
 Counterbalance: There's a little icon,
 Quidome: yes, but it doesn't match the green dot in the leaderboard
 Quidome: so i thought i give it a try&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: Sure&#160;:)
 Quidome: So you can be online and not participating. Meaning you closed your chatr window?
 Counterbalance: yes
 Quidome: aha, well, then he won't see it :p
 Counterbalance: appending something like ?disableChat  to the url does that
 Quidome: is there another way to reach out?
 Counterbalance: hmm.. I don't think so. You can send a private message, I think that also sends a notification, but you'd have to be able to click on their username in chat for that, or already have a private chat going
 Counterbalance: ahh, /msg
 Counterbalance: see /help
 Quidome: where is the help
 Counterbalance: just type /help here
 Quidome: Nice
 Quidome: hm, doesn't work either, you have to be on the chat...
 Quidome: well, a pitty
 Counterbalance: you can follow him
 Quidome: I am going to try that
 Counterbalance: then on your profile page, there's a friends tab, and there's a private message button there. That'll probably work
 Quidome: After he accepts my follow request, we will see
 Counterbalance: AFAIK acceptance is not needed
 eulerscheZahl: to send someone a private message, that person has to follow you, not the other way
 eulerscheZahl: i recommend sending a private message on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: triggers an email notification
 Quidome: :thumbsup:
 Quidome: He euler, you already in! Congratulations!
 eulerscheZahl: for a day already :P
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 Quidome: Yeah watched you junoing within the hour or so, nice
 Quidome: jumping
 eulerscheZahl: deactivated my mine avoidance to get promoted
 eulerscheZahl: then activated it again :D
 JasonTruter: Thinking of storing a node that has 4 different neightbours
 JasonTruter: What do you guys think?
 JasonTruter: Would it make it eaier for me to traverse using bfs?
 eulerscheZahl: somehow avoiding mines performs better in legend but did worse against the boss
 eulerscheZahl: JasonTruter that's what I do
 Quidome: interesting.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e05707fd-9a50-49f0-94e9-18079bf7cf19">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e05707fd-9a50-49f0-94e9-18079bf7cf19</a>
 Quidome: Now i lost my debugging possibility and am hunting Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure others print their stats as well
 Quidome: OK
 Quidome: Does anyone else print their remaining locations count
 Quidome:&#160;???
 Counterbalance: my bot prints them too - similar rank as zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: Risen too
 eulerscheZahl: don't ask me how accurate these numbers are
 Quidome: Great, going to compare them with mine, thnxs
 AntiSquid: i print an useful assessment of the enemy bot
 Quidome: great thnx
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/448160974">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/448160974</a>i officially hate this game now
 eulerscheZahl: so much rock paper scissors
 Nerchio: why?
 Quidome: Muda 
 eulerscheZahl: (or maybe my bot is just bad)
 Nerchio: your bot moved into enemy territory
 eulerscheZahl: i'm allowed to move whereever i want
 Nerchio: :D
 AntiSquid: my bot is full of bugs
 Nerchio: you are allowed
 Nerchio: but don't be surprised when you get shot
 Counterbalance: too bad we dont get opp's MSG or the bots could communicate
 dbdr: he didn't get shot by mines
 dbdr: so territory is not relevant
 AntiSquid: not sure if i told you but it's these bugs that give it +50 ranksmy new rewritten bot will hopefully get legend though, and no bugs ihope
 eulerscheZahl: just me fighting an invisible opponent while my location is clear
 AntiSquid: ya in that replay you give too much info away
 AntiSquid: also my output is helpful 
 Counterbalance: you ignore silence?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/448165415">https://www.codingame.com/replay/448165415</a> maybe i should use it more often?
 Quidome: @counterbalance, are you pruning remaining enemy positions when to high?
 Counterbalance: yes, but only &gt; 10k
 Counterbalance: I have no idea how to prune effectively&#160;:(
 Nerchio: antisquid silence spammer :O
 Zenoscave: Quidome how did you get my email?
 Counterbalance: it works!&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i told him how Zenoscave
 darkhorse64: nagatwin removes duplicates but I do not know ho
 eulerscheZahl: from your github account
 darkhorse64: *how*
 Zenoscave: Ah smart
 Zenoscave: good thinking
 eulerscheZahl: and also a lie
 eulerscheZahl: private message on cg forum
 Zenoscave: yeah i didn't get any notification from that hahah
 Astrobytes: Eulersche Troll
 wlesavo:  not a lot of promotions today huh
 eulerscheZahl: 0 to be precise
 wlesavo: i expected legend to grow faster
 eulerscheZahl: all your fault!
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl and Illedan, please keep it up!<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/WZS6c9.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/WZS6c9.jpg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but still a week to go and we don't want a huge legend
 wlesavo: lul
 YannT: well yesterday people killed the boss so it lowered the bar temporarily, I think he's quite high now
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan just submitted too
 YannT: until someone can hurt it proper it's going to be hard to get promoted
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, we destroyed the boss yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: but then it recovered
 dbdr: :innocent:
 wlesavo: got raided
 dbdr: great team work
 eulerscheZahl: you only won 4-2 dbdr
 dbdr: the straw that broke the camel's back

 Zenoscave: I still timeout
 eulerscheZahl: directly after SILENCE, suspicious
 eulerscheZahl: your tree explodes
 Zenoscave: Yeah
 Zenoscave: I don't have good tree pruning
 Zenoscave: I consider every silence option
 Zenoscave: How often is SILENCE N 0 used?
 eulerscheZahl: often
 Zenoscave: Might have to rework my bot to detect it
 ZarthaxX: how do u detectthat
 Zenoscave: is that a worthwhile task?
 eulerscheZahl: top4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YfmRduu">https://imgur.com/a/YfmRduu</a>
 Zenoscave: back pruning
 Zenoscave: Would just ignoring silence be good? and resetting if you loose them?
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like a bad idea to me, losing too much information
 Zenoscave: hmmmmm
 eulerscheZahl: maybe considering some states more likely than others could help
 Zenoscave: ok
 eulerscheZahl: right now i assume equal probability for each
 wlesavo: Zenoscave if you already considering such a drastic measures just merge
 Zenoscave: merge?
 Zenoscave: I don't understand
 SavinVadim: Did anyone implement a kinda of circular movement?
 Zenoscave: merge paths?
 SavinVadim: I think that my movement (that goes from one side to another) gives too much info and is easy to predict
 wlesavo: if to paths coming to the same point, take the common part of them and summ up the mines 
 eulerscheZahl: be the spiral SavinVadim
 wlesavo: you lose information, but not too much
 Zenoscave: interesting
 Zenoscave: I'll try that
 AntiSquid: walk into your garden and spiral around
 wlesavo: this is what im doing since wood 1 i believe
 blasterpoard: wlesavo I have something similar, but I only join pairs of paths
 eulerscheZahl: including the mines that were added on bronze&#160;;)
 wlesavo: also only pairs
 blasterpoard: basically divide the amount by two until it gets under a threshold
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl well, most of mine tracking for me was in silver, but the basic concept the same
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: What are those graphs&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there's a text above them
 pb4: and when did you download the replays&#160;?
 Zenoscave: top 4 player silence dists
 eulerscheZahl: thank you Zenoscave
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 pb4: one graph = one player&#160;?
 Zenoscave: yes
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 pb4: Which one am I&#160;? :D
 Zenoscave: 2
 pb4: nice graphs by the way
 eulerscheZahl: but the number of games i used varies a lot
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 is the 2nd indeed, 32 matches analyzed
 eulerscheZahl: i just downloaded #1 + meso i got some of yours as well
 pb4: wow, I surface 0 a lot of the time then&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't share your surface stats
 pb4: silence*
 eulerscheZahl: but you do 2x surface per game
 eulerscheZahl: i remove SURFACE | KILL here
 pb4: uh&#160;?
 pb4: I do less than that I think
 pb4: 1.4
 pb4: Your sample might be too small
 eulerscheZahl: 2x per game, 1.75x per 100 turns of your bot
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i'll check...
 kovi: which one was mine?
 eulerscheZahl: 3
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 1.56 surface in 313 matches
 eulerscheZahl: and charts for top players are converging towards each other it seems
 eulerscheZahl: some days ago they looked really different
 pb4: Agreed
 eulerscheZahl: kovi even with a bit of sonar now
 eulerscheZahl: still less than the other players
 kovi: wow, you track me hard
 YannT: I assume you didn't do me since I'm lower?&#160;:)
 pb4: who was #1&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: jolin
 pb4: and #4&#160;?
 pb4: siman&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 2000 participants 
 dbdr: \o/
 Illedan: 2k \o/
 ZarthaxX: nice :O
 eulerscheZahl: of course i got stats for you YannT
 eulerscheZahl: you haven't submitted in ages, for you i got the most battles

 YannT: yeah&#160;:|
 YannT: next version shouldn't have this
 Illedan: Hiding?
 YannT: no, benchmarking
 YannT: I submited yesterday y'know
 YannT: so not "ages" :p
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: compared to the other spam submitters there's a lot of dust on your yellow button
 AntiSquid: if you keep it up you'll suffer submit withdrawal symptoms 
 YannT: it's true I  like to be somewhat sure before pushing
 Zenoscave: 999 submits 
 Zenoscave: ...
 YannT: benchmarking against top5 is more relevant than just pushing anyway in my estimation
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have 721 matches for you YannT
 eulerscheZahl: (your most recent bot that is)
 AntiSquid: i am surprised i even have 292 submits
 YannT: also I like that I can "freeze" agentIds used, so I can actually compare results
 wlesavo: im benchmarking top 6 =)
 blasterpoard: I have 49 ^^
 eulerscheZahl: 141 C# submits + 1 Java here
 blasterpoard: submits
 YannT: otherwise those guy change their bot 10 times per minute so you can't compare anything
 DEIZ21: hello, i have a problem with CG Spunk it doesnt work for me a,y idea?
 eulerscheZahl: that tool broke years ago
 YannT: I think that's deprecated
 YannT: you want cgbenchmark
 eulerscheZahl: and CG Enhancer
 DEIZ21: ah, i need to run battle in batch mode
 eulerscheZahl: cg benchmark
 DEIZ21: i can search for it in CG?
 eulerscheZahl: or brutaltester to play against yourself offline
 YannT: (brutaltester I haven't found to be very pertinent with this game)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark</a>
 DEIZ21: cool, thx
 YannT: I have a version that seems to have a 50% winrate against top5
 YannT: my rule is to do better than 50% before pushing tho :p
 eulerscheZahl: my rule is to submit when i'm in a mood to do so
 eulerscheZahl: or crying in desperation
 dbdr: yolo
 Illedan: I'm full on yolo
 YannT: I can't for the  life of me figure out why kovi is my best winrate and pb4 / siman are my worst ones
 YannT: there's no strategy difference to explain it
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan climbing highi can't tolerate that, will fight back tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: my old enemy...
 wlesavo: speaking about 50&#160;% <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/yVoTQYV">https://imgur.com/yVoTQYV</a>
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: battle for #1 C# is full on
 Illedan: I'm going for 1st
 YannT: I think I've won #1 kotlin already :joy:
 dbdr: well done YannT, you can rest now
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't seem to be a hard fight
 YannT: ahah no, not really
 eulerscheZahl: in the past there were tshirts for the first in each language
 YannT: it's such a sweet language tho, I don't know why you'd do Java over Kotlin ever
 eulerscheZahl: but that was long ago
 eulerscheZahl: i used kotlin recently
 eulerscheZahl: for kotlin heroes on codeforces
 YannT: it's so friendly about everything I love it
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe intelliJ helped a bit to convert java into kotlin :innocent:
 dbdr: fully automated?
 YannT: whenever you think "I should be able to write something like this", it turns out you can
 eulerscheZahl: there's an intelliJ plugin for that
 eulerscheZahl: still a few minor things (not-null&#160;!!)
 eulerscheZahl: but did a great job overall
 eulerscheZahl: and that&#160;!! isn't a bug, just kotlin having other requirements than java
 YannT: null checking is actually a sweet feature of the language
 YannT: you can write stuff like
 eulerscheZahl: yeah
 YannT: maybeNullVar?.let { ...
 YannT: and the let will only be done if not null
 YannT: you never get a NPE again
 eulerscheZahl: one thing that sometimes annoys me about java: catch every damn exception
 eulerscheZahl: i understand that you should really do it for an enterprise project
 eulerscheZahl: but when i code my 10 lines for a small private project, i don't care about exceptions
 dbdr: throws Exception
 YannT: kotlin is good for that too
 YannT: val a: Int? = try { parseInt(input) } catch (e: NumberFormatException) { null }
 YannT: it's a convenient one liner
 eulerscheZahl: and add that throws to each function in the call chain up to main
 dbdr: yes, or script it&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that wasn't the intention of java inventors
 dbdr: or catch and wrap in RuntimeException
 dbdr: sure
 YannT: actually the "Int?." part here is even for clarity, it's not necessary
 dbdr: the intention is to have robust code
 YannT: val i = try { parseInt(input) } catch (e: NumberFormatException) { null }
 dbdr: that's why python can be good for protoyping
 dbdr: YannT, eulerscheZahl complains about having to catch exceptions, and you show Kotlin can catch exceptions&#160;;)
 YannT: except in a very compact way
 eulerscheZahl: except: pass
 eulerscheZahl: python style
 Zenoscave: [empty everything]
 Zenoscave: js style
 YannT: oh then
 YannT: "Kotlin does not have checked exceptions"
 YannT: :p
 Astrobytes: noexcept, it either runs or it doesn't
 dbdr: how do you guarantee you handle them then?
 YannT: the kotlin standard library abstracts the checked exceptions  of JRE
 eulerscheZahl: JS on CG <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/QjCX3rJ">https://imgur.com/a/QjCX3rJ</a>
 YannT: you get nulls and stuff
 dbdr: I mean, if it's not checke it means you program might crash at runtime
 YannT: no
 dbdr: potentially in rare cases
 YannT: it turns checked ezxceptions into nullables, which in kotlin have to  be handled
 YannT: so you might have something like 
 dbdr: null is just one case
 YannT: val i = parseInt(blah)&#160;?: 0
 dbdr: what about IO errors?
 aCat: hey  -when gold boss became nondeterministic&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: The whole time
 aCat: that makes testing against him useless
 YannT: val bufferedReader: BufferedReader = File("example.txt").bufferedReader()    
 aCat: hmm, why before I had imprssion it is otherwise..
 dbdr: and if the read fails?
 YannT: you don't get anything
 dbdr: empty string?
 YannT: no, unchecked exception
 YannT: you can handle it if you want
 dbdr: and i you don't you crash
 YannT: otherwise you just get a null string
 YannT: no
 YannT: .use has built in exception handling
 dbdr: ok, then it just does not go into that branch?
 YannT: yep
 YannT: that's the idea with kotlin
 dbdr: sometimes that's fine
 dbdr: sometimes it's not
 dbdr: and this could be hiding the issue
 YannT: well you can catch if you want, or you can use the kotlin abstraction and never have to catch anything , exceptions turn into nullables, so you just handle nullability of things (and the compiler makes you)
 dbdr: everything looks fine, no error, but it does not do what you wanted, and no indication why
 dbdr: ok, in that case it goes into the null handling
 YannT: yes
 YannT: if you want to handle a specific underlying exception, you can do that, and if you don't wanna it's just nullability handling, which in kotlin is the&#160;? operation
 dbdr: so that's fine, but it's roughly equivalent to handling exceptions, i.e. you have to handle it someho
 YannT: operator*
 YannT: yes, you have to add a&#160;? somewhere
 Astrobytes: Yeah but it's not as annoying as having to handle them in Java
 dbdr: only if you want to ignore that case
 dbdr: which you do sometimes but not always
 YannT: path?.contains(this)
 YannT: if path is null,  no exception
 YannT: that returns a Boolean? type tho, not Boolean, so you have to write
 dbdr: sure, but if it's a logcal error not to have a path, it's bad to get false
 YannT: path?.contains(this) == true
 YannT: no, a Boolean? can be true false or null
 YannT: basically you cannot get a nullpointer, compiler won't let you
 dbdr: I know that
 YannT: Boolean? is not Boolean
 dbdr: i'm saying a crash is better than incorrect semantics
 YannT: then you can do
 YannT: path!!.contains(this)
 dbdr: right
 YannT: you assert that path is not null and it will crash if it is
 YannT: you *can* get nullpointers if you specifically want to&#160;:)
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 elsinnombre2d2: which heuristics do u use to get a good path?
 blasterpoard: elsinnombre2d2 well, I have a 600-line "heuristic" for that that runs for 20 milliseconds
 blasterpoard: I don't think that there's a knwon, simple algorithm that gives you a "good path" in this game
 blasterpoard: at least, not really good
 elsinnombre2d2: ofc, but u use some rules
 elsinnombre2d2: maybe like choose a cell that is near to one visited
 blasterpoard: uhm... maybe I use an evaluation
 blasterpoard: of a long path
 elsinnombre2d2: and why all use c++?  xD
 blasterpoard: not just the next cell
 YannT: a good starting point is using floodfill to calculate the number of available cells
 blasterpoard: elsinnombre2d2 it's fast
 elsinnombre2d2: than java too?
 blasterpoard: java is not quite as fast
 elsinnombre2d2: hmmm
 Nerchio: im pretty sure you can get to the top with jkava
 elsinnombre2d2: using floodfill, which depth do u get?
 Nerchio: i am using floodfill for the whole map
 Nerchio: for each of my possible moves
 Nerchio: dont worry about this i think, you will have more problems with tracking the enemy
 Nerchio: and potentially running out of time
 AntiSquid: you can get to the top with python 3, but java is both uglier and slower than c++
 blasterpoard: and you'll also hit the character limit faster with java
 blasterpoard: that matters in this game at the top too
 Nerchio: in intellij i see i have 36k chars
 Nerchio: how much is the limit?
 mlomb: 100kB
 YannT: my bot is like 500 lines :p
 pb4: -_-
 Rbee: Is there any way to view the past questions on clash of code?
 elsinnombre2d2: nah, my problem is finding the path, my  tracking algorithm is not really expensive at this moment
 Nerchio: it means it's not good enough haha :D
 AntiSquid: golfed? YannT
 YannT: nope, kotlined :p
 Illedan: I'm at 60k chars
 elsinnombre2d2: why floodfill? i cant see the utility
 YannT: 561 lines, I just added a thing to test
 YannT: :p
 aCat: YannT impressed&#160;;-)
 Illedan: 2k lines
 aCat: but I believe the lines are 'write once' never read
 Illedan: kovi, close enough to top 4 now?&#160;;)
 aCat: haskell-style ;p
 YannT: it's really the same kind of thing yes&#160;:)
 kovi: nice illedan!
 Illedan: dbdr and pb4 inc to ruin my party&#160;:(
 wlesavo: wow
 Nerchio: who are the guys writing Cpt. bots for this game
 dbdr: wlesavo wrote LeChuck
 wlesavo: everyone and noone
 Astrobytes: The Wood bosses are written by the game authors and the other bosses are user-bots chosen by CG
 Nerchio: so when legend opened the bot was chosen from one of the top at that time?
 dbdr: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes, w lesavo's bot (from that time) is the gold boss
 Nerchio: it's too strong&#160;:(
 Nerchio: i know who to blame now
 YannT: consider lucky you didn't get his current bot as boss :p
 wlesavo: it differs a little codewise, but i actully broke smth in  a boss submit
 blasterpoard: Nerchio we need a strong boss, because otherwise we'd need more games to climb in legend
 Nerchio: yea makes sense
 dbdr: also legend should be legendary&#160;;)
 Nerchio: it's cool that potential kill shots can be done from like 10 squares away
 blasterpoard: ...and it's not *that* strong
 Nerchio: i am working on implementing kill shots like the gold boss who teleports across the map to finish me :D
 dbdr: TELEPORT X Y
 blasterpoard: I don't have that in my bot
 Nerchio: i just died to the cpt
 Nerchio: imagine this
 Nerchio: surface -&gt; move and load 1 more power so you can use silence -&gt; torpedo -&gt; trigger mine
 Nerchio: this was the kill shot from 3 hp
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 Nerchio: feelsbad
 blasterpoard: quite common
 wlesavo: only smitsi teleports
 AntiSquid: stronger boss doesn't solve slow submitsbut it's good to have a strong boss since it will be a multi anyway and it goes straight into multi after this
 AntiSquid: meaning most people stay active improve and flood legend 
 AntiSquid: maybe
 YannT: multi bosses won't necessarily be the same though?
 AntiSquid: i am sure they will, since the ladder doesn't change
 AntiSquid: you go straight into same league as you weere in the contest
 blasterpoard: YannT I think in crystal rush they are
 kovi: gratz pb4
 YannT: ahah 33 :D
 JasonTruter: I'm in wood 1 now
 Astrobytes: gratz JasonTruter
 Nerchio: thats not bad congrats
 JasonTruter: Just movement though
 Nerchio: that's how most of us start 
 YannT: gratz JasonTruter&#160;:)
 JasonTruter: Thanks guys
 YannT: now time  to fire some torpedoes
 JasonTruter: Yeah
 JasonTruter: I have silence and sonar now
 Nerchio: i used sonar+movement+torpedoes until gold
 JasonTruter: I've written my code to be more manageable now
 JasonTruter: hated all the ifs
 Nerchio: i live and breath if skyscrapers
 icecream17: 8th place out of 6000, wow
 JasonTruter: SHWEET
 icecream17: I used to have a super complicated thing for CSB, but I replaced it with a single if statement. wow
 Nerchio: what is csb
 icecream17: coders strike back (i don't feel like doing ocean of code anymore)
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 icecream17: I'm in silver, but can't make anymore progress. Every improvement makes it worse somehow
 Nerchio: maybe you will come back with fresh mind :D
 wlesavo: so pb4 was it just lucky submit or real improvements?
 AntiSquid: go to discord and watch the streams, maybe you'll figure something out icecream17or save the bot and start over and try something new
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: real improvements
 JasonTruter: Question, should you use all the actions?
 JasonTruter: just because they are there?
 JasonTruter: I intend on just using sonar and torpedo
 rwilson: JasonTruter torpedo too early &amp; you give away your position. and if you don't use Silence, you won't be able to re-hide after your position is known.
 JasonTruter: I see
 pb4: JasonTruter&#160;: early on focus on torpedo/silence, then add mines
 JasonTruter: When you fire a torpedo do you give away positon?
 pb4: somewhat
 JasonTruter: Oh using your life?
 rwilson: early leagues easy to pass with torpedo and silence though ... silver &amp; gold seem to be where early torpedos mess you over too hard to pass on.
 pb4: You show you're somewhere in range of where you shot
 JasonTruter: I really need to get some decent pathfinding going
 JasonTruter: I think it's holding me back from moving towards a position
 JasonTruter: Example if I need to move towards my opponent if I know he's in a specific location, or moving to sectors
 NormantasStankevicius: Just curious guys, what do you normally do, when your opponent uses silence?
 JasonTruter: Is it worth rewriting everything?
 YannT: probably not, optimizing your path to stay underwater longer is generally more important than trying to get to the ennemy
 Astrobytes: JasonTruter are you floodflilling from each possible direction?
 Astrobytes: *floodfilling
 JasonTruter: floodfilling?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just checking the most accesible cells from each position
 Astrobytes: *accessible
 JasonTruter: Ah I see, no I'm not flood filling right now
 JasonTruter: I have my own algorithm that uses a bunch of different inputs to detect the area
 Astrobytes: Flooding with a BFS is useful
 JasonTruter: Yeah, then Im planning on BFS to location while tracking every move my opponent does and updating my destination everytime
 Astrobytes: If you go in the direction with the most available accessible cells you'll maximise your tiem under water, for now
 Astrobytes: *not correcting any more of my typos
 JasonTruter: Maximizing time just reduces being seen right?
 JasonTruter: time under water*
 Astrobytes: Yeah, unless sonar/tracking etc, but it's a good start
 JasonTruter: A tactic I could use is reset on edge of map, then BFS to opponent
 JasonTruter: So I have a clear path
 JasonTruter: Surface on edge of map *
 Astrobytes: You don't wanna surface too much, you lose life remember
 JasonTruter: Oh yeah forgot about that. But possibly do it once just to get a clear path
 Astrobytes: Try going to cell with most available flooded cells and surface when you run out. 
 rwilson: if you watch the higher league replays, you'll see that most of the time anyone uses SURFACE is to be able to go back over their own path - because they don't want to keep going ( usually a mine field, or face check an enemy that knows their position )
 JasonTruter: I see
 JasonTruter: So best advice is find a path where you don't surface at all
 rwilson: simple flood fill to avoid surfacing should be enough to help get up to bronze/silver ( with a bit extra) 
 Astrobytes: ^^
 JasonTruter: I'm fairly new to algorithms&#160;:) so learning along the way
 Astrobytes: Good time to learn dude!
 JasonTruter: I work with high level code mostly, and understand data structures well
 JasonTruter: All the algo's were built already
 JasonTruter: So now I can actually think
 rwilson:&#160;;) and a fun way to do it...&#160;;) so much easier to go learn BFS if you'lre make that next League ( versus .. just because  :) )
 JasonTruter: Yeah dude
 JasonTruter: I'm actually hooked to this game
 Astrobytes: You'll get hooked to the others too, I guarantee it :D
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for tonight
 Astrobytes: cya's later
 JasonTruter: cheers!
 YannT: it's actually not a bad idea to  go to leaderboards and watch some high rank replays to get an iidea of what you probably should be doing&#160;;)
 YannT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard</a>
 YannT: "view last battles"
 YannT: although you don't have mines yet
 Nerchio: how do you guys tackle life lost?
 Nerchio: i mean people can surface/get hit by their/your mine your/their rocket etc.
 rwilson:&#160;;) life lost plays into a number of scenarios ..   if you're careful, you can use most of them to gain more information
 rwilson: the 2 main ones being,  1. they SHOULD know where you are down to at least 9 squares, unless it was a surface --- so you might want to run.
 rwilson: 2. if they got hurt by your stuff, you can narrow your knowledge of where they are
 Nerchio: i know i do most of this stuff
 Nerchio: but what i am saying is
 Nerchio: sometimes you get false positives
 rwilson:&#160;;) only if you don't code it to account.. 
 Nerchio: like i hit a guy with direct rocket + a mine so 3hp
 Nerchio: but i usually think that direct rocket is 2hp
 rwilson: i.e.  if you assume they lost life from your shot, but they also surfaced...  then you've coded it wrong&#160;;) 
 Nerchio: so if i code it for 3hp when they combo
 Nerchio: what if i shot him 2 hp and he shot himself for 1hp
 Nerchio: then i have false positive and my tracking my fall apart
 rwilson:&#160;;)   it's only a false positive if you don't take into account the other information you have.. 
 rwilson: i.e.  you always know if he surfaced, you always know when he triggers, and you always know when they fire a torpedo .. 
 Nerchio: hmm
 rwilson: if any of those comibnations could 'confuse' your knowledge of 'did i hit him?' ...  then you must assume you did not
 Nerchio: i should trust my stats more i guess
 Nerchio: I do assume i did not and thats why i lost some games
 rwilson: ....&#160;;)  or split it .. and record it probabilisitically , like MAYBE ..  but can't use it as 100% knowledge like you can while figuring out path movements.. 
 Nerchio: i already have enough splits because of silence :D
 Nerchio: but actually you gave me a nice idea
 rwilson:&#160;;)  might be able to improve that a bit...     most of the time in my games, it looks like silence only hides for usually 1 silence ( meaning, by the time you can silence again, your position &amp; prior path has converged
 Nerchio: true
 Nerchio: but i should consider 3hp as 2+1 so direct hit + something
 Nerchio: i mean there could be stuff like 1+1+1 but that would be crazy :D
 Nerchio: maybe not worth taking that into account
 rwilson: my mine, their mine &amp; surface, or a missed torp
 Nerchio: i mean surface i basically ignore
 Nerchio: in terms of hp lost
 Nerchio: so its more like rocket close/rocket close/ mine or something
 Nerchio: instead of direct rocket + something
 Nerchio: i guess still lots of possibilities
 rwilson:&#160;;) unless you thought your mine detonation caused it ...   ;)  i watch to make sure i don't accidentally narrow location due to dmg.. when they actually just surfaced.. 
 Nerchio: i did narrow down a few times too much and i lost track of everything thats why i want to be careful with this now
 Nerchio: I need to remember if I shot 100% shot last turn or not
 rwilson:&#160;;)  gets a bit trickier if you fire a torp and mine ...   he takes 1 dmg..    you can still narrow - but you have to be careful with how you do it.. 
 Nerchio: i can't make a mistake a direct shot for 2 close-torpedos for 1hp
 Nerchio: yea
 Nerchio: the one you are talking about
 Nerchio: i mean
 rwilson:&#160;;) you don't really know / care if you THOUGHT it was 100% ... you just know the result ...  use that to correct your 'belief' of where they are.
 Nerchio: if torpedo and mine don't overlap you can't do much i guess
 Nerchio: i will need to reconsider this part of my bot
 Nerchio: still have some mistakes
 rwilson:&#160;:)  225 cells max,   torp and mine cover at most 18 in a turn ..   even if they don't overlap , you a 1ph hit  would confirm their in one of those 18 ( just don't get confuesd by surface, or enemy self damage )
 Nerchio: that's what i mean they can hit themselves and unless you know their exact position you can't know
 rwilson: lots of info ...  and it does look like many of the top guys have that coded in already .. but it doesnt' look like thats the MAIN thing
 Nerchio: sure but every turn counts so properly assessing this information is important
 Nerchio: in some cases you probably just have to accept that you can't use the knowledge from hp lost
 rwilson:&#160;;) it's a giant pile of VEN Diagrams&#160;;)   you can always glean SOME information out of it ...     it may not always be 'THEY ARE HERE "...  but it's always (  are they inside or outside this set of spaces )
 Nerchio: okay thanks i will think about this tomorrow but maybe focus first on fixing some other stuff 
 YannT: the only really confusing information is if they hit themselves
 pb4: Why would it be confusing&#160;?
 rwilson:&#160;;) was thinking the same thing... 
 rwilson: but i totally get what YannT is getting at ...    you'd assume MOST of the time they wouldn't shoot themselves 
 YannT: also if they shoot themselves, you don't know when that happened in their turn (it could be before or after moving)
 rwilson: but i coded in a special allowance to allow self damage if it wins... ( and i see a lot of top bots do MORE self dmg , even if it's a couple turns till it wins )
 YannT: you know your torpedo hits before they move, you know when they fired theirs (before or after moving), but you don't know what hit what really
 rwilson:&#160;;) right,  the area of uncertainty is larger than normal.. but shouldn't be too confusing&#160;;) 
 YannT: so if they hit themselves, it  can be  confusing
 YannT: you actually miss the information
 Nerchio: that's what i am getting at
 YannT: you fire a torpedo, they fire a torpedo, they lose life, you don't know which hit what
 Nerchio: if you do damage and you expect it it's all good
 Nerchio: but if they also fire a torpedo and hit themselves for 1hp or something it gets tricky
 YannT: there's actually missing information, you can't know
 rwilson: ... but you know the damage was done whilst inside one of those blast radius ...  so .. keep all potentials inside..  and prune all outside .. 
 YannT: yep
 YannT: still, it's confusing :p
 Nerchio: yeah thats obvious
 Nerchio: but ideally i would like to say, i see 3 positions i shoot a rocket for '2' hp so I would like to think its a direct hit
 Nerchio: but if they also shot a rocket, was it really a direct hit?
 rwilson:&#160;;) and that's exactly what you learn&#160;:) ..   you only get a direct hit, if you fire , do no other dmg, they don't sufrace , trigger or torp..  THEN you know it's a direct hit&#160;;) 
 rwilson: SOMETIMES you 'KNOW'&#160;;) but sometimes it'll be a cloud of 2 or 3 things .. ( that can still DRASTICALLY narrow down their location ... )
 wlesavo: lol 40% vs pb4 and 50 vs illedan is enough to push me on their subs
 rwilson: nice
 pb4: push you up&#160;?
 wlesavo: yes
 pb4: :D
 wlesavo: from like 10-12 to 7
 YannT: pushing small improvements&#160;:)
 YannT: not doing well :D
 icecream17: oooh 2nd place
 icecream17: YAS. Cars collide with each other. huh
 icecream17: What? 20998th? That doesn't even fit on the square...
 Zenoscave: Are any legend players detirministic?
 elderlybeginner: how to find which easy puzzles gives bronze achievements
 elderlybeginner:&#160;?
 elderlybeginner: maybe achievement showcase shows them all?
 struct: It shows all yes
 elderlybeginner:&#160;:(then it's time for medium ones
 struct: Its a good ting
 struct: thing*

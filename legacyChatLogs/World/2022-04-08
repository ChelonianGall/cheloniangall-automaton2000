 PatrickMcGinnisII: Next H lines doesn't make any sense Westicles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Oh it's giving you a 2d matrix for scoring
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not clear to me what was going on
 Westicles: oh, yeah for gerrymandering
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someone trying to prevent cut/paste in contributions?  If they are it's effecting the IDE too
 Not_The_One: what i9s this about taco?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: wanna taco 'bout it?
 Automaton2000: [auto] miki09 has awarded wontonimo 10 tacos. wontonimo now has 42 taco

 PenguinPero: can I share a youtube video, I solved one of the puzzles here (Surface) in the video guide&#160;?
 Nickilarson: yes
 PenguinPero: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzI-sXlCB70&amp;ab_channel=PenguinPero">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzI-sXlCB70&amp;ab_channel=PenguinPero</a>
 PenguinPero: I have a lot of videos now, mostly interview questions, and a Sudoku Solver :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: PenguinPero since the landscape doesn't change and you are running multiple start points thru it, you could have pre-processed a bit
 dostros: Guys someone has done shadows of the knight episode 1 please&#160;?
 PenguinPero: I think I know what you mean by preprocessed it a bit, but it is a guide video that I wanted to keep simple
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if it wasn't c# the 100 pts thru 1kx1k wouldn't have time imo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: coord pairs could have been done differently, but that's a style choice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll shut up now
 PenguinPero: xd no problembut yeah as I said, I think this is good enough for a youtube guide
 PenguinPero: my mind also always goes after recording soemthing, oh I could have done that thing better and more optimised
 PatrickMcGinnisII: PenguinPero it's all good, no one would be interested in my videos.  Twitchers during contest are interesting, although my lang. never matches.  So the effort you put in is commendable. I'm not trolling, just sugg.
 PenguinPero: thanks man&#160;:) 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sun is coming up her in Florida, so I gotta stop watching youtube and stangnating code.  Have a nice day.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my code on Block the fire is now 681 lines... eventually i can submit again
 NewCoder09: can someone with bag of balls
 NewCoder09: help
 NewCoder09: bag of balls
 CSPigeon: i have bag of balls
 CSPigeon: what do you need help without
 NewCoder09: everything
 Uljahn: That's because you're trying to solve medium puzzle. Are easy puzzles too easy for you?
 Hugesn0wduck: hi yall
 JordanPessman: yo
 NewCoder09: Uljahn me?
 Darleanow: guys, why do i hate so much ppl who dev in ruby&#160;?
 Darleanow: i mean this language needs a nerf, being able to solve something in 20 chars is a shame
 Uljahn: you mean it's impossible for you to learn ruby?
 Darleanow: no, but i'm using py.
 luka74: yo les geeker qui se douche une fois par ans vous puez la merde

 Wontonimo: luka74 you have been kicked.  you are welcome to come back if you act respectfully
 Kaelidian: Morning everyone
 darkhorse64: all this guy deserves is a ban
 Wontonimo: okay, will do
 Not_The_One: Man, I really hate it when people are mean online. You don't even have to mean you niceties, just be nice. Its easy to fake online.. Some people need to learn that.
 darkhorse64: level3, first words are insults -&gt; troll
 Wontonimo: agreed
 eulerscheZahl: i won't let this guy ruin my weekend
 Not_The_One: Same.
 Not_The_One: I'm going on spring break tomorrow, heading back to the home land

 Wontonimo: speaking of level 3 ... Not_The_One, get some levels and rank :grin:
 Not_The_One: Lmaooo
 Not_The_One: Will do!
 Wontonimo: I love the mars lander series.  let me know in a DM if you want help with 1 and 2
 Not_The_One: I'm gonna do the descent first, see how that goes
 Wontonimo: also practice here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a> (sorry if I already sent this to you)
 Wontonimo: I tried to ban luka but didn't get a confirmation :shrug:  
 Not_The_One: oosh
 Not_The_One: that took me longer then i wished
 darkhorse64: May because he is disconnected
 darkhorse64: Maybe
 Sarstan: Is there an exercises site like that, but for other languages?
 eulerscheZahl: we have about 25 languages here, which ones are you missing?
 1mpossible_c: the among
 eulerscheZahl: list of other websites: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/resources/">https://clist.by/resources/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: most of them are more puzzle-centered. no animated viewer. and with frequent contests
 Sarstan: I'm focused on C#, but that HackInScience site has a nice format.
 eulerscheZahl: we have C# here on CodinGame too
 Sarstan: I know. Just not much chance to learn on site alone.
 eulerscheZahl: are you looking for a more beginner level?
 a-Rye: Code Wars is better for beginners. That's what I was doing before I found CodinGame
 Sarstan: To some degree. I've gone through Codecademy's lessons for C#, but there feels like a big gap between that and most of what's on here.
 1mpossible_c: what happened to the connection
 Sarstan: I signed up for code wars and didn't get into it. Guess it's time, lol.
 Husoski: @Sarstan - I agree with a-Rye; over at CodeWars I've got my Ruby skills jump-started from "Hello World" up to "Hello Fizzbuzz, let's make a Christmas Tree"
 eulerscheZahl: and in 2 weeks: come back here, we will have a contest
 eulerscheZahl: the first for a year, so don't miss it
 dbf: hope that first and not the last&#160;:)
 Husoski: Sarstan, more to the point...the best way to get better at problem solving is to solve problems.  Tutorial sites like Codecademy are a good way to get an introduction to syntax, but tend to be a bit lightweight on problems that take some extended thought.
 eulerscheZahl: we'll see, i don't have any insider info anymore
 eulerscheZahl: and probably even CG doesn't know the format of the next contest yet
 Husoski: That's what I think you get more of here and at other competitive programming sites.
 Not_The_One: Yo yo i thought you said codewars was for beginners??
 Not_The_One: I almost failed the entrance exam
 Wontonimo: also, going back and re-solving puzzles you did in the past without using google or your previous solution is fantastic practice for mastery 
 Husoski: Amen
 wlesavo: hm, i think i've almost never used google for a puzzle, except maybe the golf ones
 Sarstan: I think the gap really comes in from getting challenges that you've never seen anything like and not sure where to even begin. What tools are out there.
 Wontonimo: Sarstan , I don't know where to begin for half the puzzles here other than to research and try several approaches 
 Sarstan: True, and I've been able to claw my way into some things I stumble across. But I imagine most people just drop it when coming to an unfamiliar issue. Like I wouldn't have the first idea how to do floodfill or anything related to that. I know some of the puzzles offer hints, but it would be cool if there was a stepping stone toward that stuff on site.
 Wontonimo: some of the skills are clickable and go to pages like this on codingame <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/flood-fill">https://www.codingame.com/learn/flood-fill</a>
 Wontonimo: with external references
 Wontonimo: yeah, CG is more like a do-it-yourself research thing with just links to external resources.  Sometimes there are good playgrounds , but I haven't found it really promoted or linked to puzzles
 Sarstan: I dread when a wiki article is all that's available. Either it's just an overhead explanation or my eyes glaze over with pseudocode that feels vague. Or maybe I'm lazy and don't want to read, lol.I'm glad that example has another more practical application to show and explain.
 a-Rye: Wontonimo's got the right idea, I've been looking back at my previous solutions and refactoring them. Also, some concepts blend over between CW and CG. I just did a Sudoku Validator puzzle here using the logic I used on CW with the level 4 Kata: Sudoku Solution Validator
 a-Rye: Although, a lot of my being able to recognize concepts on the code clashes comes from many unseen attempts at said clashes. If you do enough clashes, you'll remember the quick answers and be done
 1zanie: hello world
 Not_The_One: Hello 1zanie
 1zanie: feels good to be back.
 Not_The_One: Welcome back old friend
 Not_The_One: :hugging:
 Not_The_One: How was your journey?
 Sarstan: Always fun to get into a clash and know you're in over your head, lol. Start to type something of a code before the time is up. It definitely helps to see what others submit though.
 PainEXE: clash of code is fun except when they give you some random unclear goal
 PainEXE: that is 10 pages long
 Sarstan: Oh geez, that too. Eat away at least a minute just reading the backstory.
 PainEXE: yeah
 Wontonimo: i don't like it.  i find it stressful :shrug: I like time to think
 Husoski: What I do like about clashes is when people share.  You can look at solutions in whatever languages were used, not just one that you succeeded in.
 PainEXE: yeah
 PainEXE: at simple puzzles are fun
 PainEXE: with clear goals
 PainEXE: Imma just make a bunch of clash of code puzzles that are simple
 Sarstan: Getting puzzles in codewars done. Nice to have some really simple stuff for a change, lol.
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 jacek: clash? fun? O:
 [James]: sup

 Silver_Indigo: Hello all, running into an odd error
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Silver_Indigo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 2 tacos
 Silver_Indigo: i have a list of lists in python (site_list)
 Silver_Indigo: this is a list of lists of info from one of the gmae coding challenges, resource management
 Silver_Indigo: site_list = [[0, 410, 640], [1, 1510, 360], [2, 1170, 464], [3, 750, 536], [4, 536, 360], [5, 1384, 640], [6, 711, 158], [7, 1209, 842], [8, 967, 849], [9, 953, 151], [10, 182, 823], [11, 1738, 177]]
 Silver_Indigo: I am trying to iterate through it in a for loop and getting a "TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not list"
 Silver_Indigo: for i in site_list:
 Silver_Indigo: error occurs on dist_x = queen_x-site_list[i][1] (thats a typo there is no "[0]") buyt would likely happen on the next line as well
 anp0: i in your case is a list
 Silver_Indigo: hmm
 anp0: if you want to access both the index of the sublist and the sublist, use enumerate()
 anp0: for i, sublist in enumerate(site_list):
 Silver_Indigo: interesting, i guess i didnt know as much about for loops as i thought previously
 Silver_Indigo: many thanks!
 anp0: yep, the for loop in Python for lists, iterates over the content of your list. So think, "for human in humans". Good luck!

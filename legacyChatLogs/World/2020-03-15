 JavaMan: sad
 miszu: that's why I said goodbye to java and hello to c++ for challenges here
 miszu: but C++ is a kind of friend you want to be friend with but he doesn't want to.
 miszu: throwing errors and core dumps
 Z_Doctor: I doubt c++ actually makes code shorter :smirk:
 miszu: depends what you need for. I use it for bot competition now
 miszu: it is just I am facing with lots of errors due to the language rules
 Th1nhNg0: i love this site &lt;3

 AntiSquid: hi i am new
 NobodyA: anyone teach me ASCII Art?
 Mehroz: what is it?
 NobodyA: a task?
 jang888: hi
 NobodyA: hello
 jang888: do u know minecraft
 NobodyA: i do but i dont play it
 NobodyA: anyone here play tanki online?
 jang888: :kissing:
 jang888: tanki?
 NobodyA: yeah
 jang888: what was it?
 NobodyA: nvm
 NobodyA: pls any professionals help me with ASCII Art
 Uljahn: just skip it, solve puzzles you can handle then come back
 AntiSquid: you're out of luck, everyone here is unprofessional NobodyA
 NobodyA: srsly lol
 NobodyA: how do u type red words
 AntiSquid: zrzly
 AntiSquid: hax
 NobodyA: :O
 NobodyA: dats a pro
 Uljahn: just read the chat help: People will receive notifications when you mention their nickname in the chat, and see those messages displayed in purple 
 Uljahn: NobodyA
 NobodyA: oh
 NobodyA: thx
 NobodyA: AntiSquid dont fool me
 Uljahn: those who don't read help deserve to be fooled&#160;:)
 NobodyA: :rage:
 NobodyA: im just a newbie who didnt know that theres a help button

 jang888: iron man
 NobodyA: YEET i finally did ASCII Art
 MadKnight: when did AntiSquid become a russian&#160;?
 MadKnight: oh, toctou turned him into a russian
 MSmits: uhm, are Russians like the Borg?
 MSmits: Rusistance is futile!
 MadKnight: russians are like lol)
 MadKnight: hi)
 AntiSquid: idk wdym)
 MadKnight: AntiSquid)
 AntiSquid: MadKnight)
 AntiSquid: privet
 MadKnight: privet AntiSquid how's your nothing?)
 AntiSquid: training a model that can predict how many russians it takes to drink 10 kegs of vodka or more
 AntiSquid: Madao)
 MadKnight: just a few syniaks
 MadKnight: hey Uljahn how do u spell синяки in eng&#160;?
 Uljahn: drunkards?
 MadKnight: yea or just a single cast of a russian movie about war
 MadKnight: these characters drink so much vodka it feels like drunkards won the war
 MadKnight: or that drunkards wrote the script
 AntiSquid: THEY DID
 AntiSquid: LOL
 AntiSquid: those movies are 100% realistic
 AntiSquid: everyone else died of frost bites trying to invade russia
 MadKnight: in those movies germans died because they were too kind to kill
 MSmits: being drunk doesnt protect you from hypothermia though
 MSmits: just from frostbite to your extremities
 MSmits: but it's actually worse that way. Any cold that will cause frostbite, will kill you if you're drunk enough
 MSmits: because your entire body cools instead of mostly your fingers and toes
 MadKnight: only generals were drunkardies in those movies
 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: MadKnight i guess that's one of the few lies, but german sholdiers did get depressed from what they were doing
 AntiSquid: soldiers *
 MadKnight: just too kind, not too depressed AntiSquid
 MSmits: not as depressed as their victims probably :P
 MadKnight: they were like "but they're people! are u sure we need to shoot them? even if they're attacking us right now?"
 AntiSquid: it still affected them mentally MSmits, it's weird but some committed suicide
 AntiSquid: also germans were using their allies as cannon fodder, so probably it wasn't germans shooting at them at that time
 MSmits: not surprising
 MSmits: war is not a happy time
 Uljahn: also not all troops were the same so it's easy to cherry-pick some trained volunteers or newbee conscriptors depending on your goal, that's what propaganda usually do
 AntiSquid: anyways drunkards did win the war and if those generals weren't drunk af as the movies show then i would be extremely surprised
 AntiSquid: what multi are you doing MSmits&#160;?
 AntiSquid: do you start new multi while fitting params?
 MSmits: I do AntiSquid. I am finishing up langtons ant with fitting, was also still fitting oware. Doing some test grading and homework, but if I get that done any time soon I will try to code an Onitama bot
 jang888: fortnite end game
 AntiSquid: make a fortnite multi jang888

 AntiSquid: ask him
 AntiSquid: anything
 jang888: i get it already
 TheVoodooDev: helo
 wlesavo: damn, finally finished labirint
 MSmits: grats
 MSmits: I remember having problems with it too
 wlesavo: thx
 wlesavo: spaghetty code though
 MSmits: doesnt matter
 struct: I finished setting up WSL and Visual studio
 struct: Now I can code on Visual studio
 struct: and dont have to use linux
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: it's a privilege to be able to use it
 AntiSquid: lol struct
 struct: Its nothing against linux
 struct: But I just like VS too much
 AntiSquid: i prefer vsc so w/e
 MSmits: it's nice when you're used to an inferior product. Will feel so much better when you switch to VS AntiSquid&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: it's no inferior
 AntiSquid: it's highly customizable
 MSmits: yeah, I tried it for a bit, too much work
 MSmits: stuff doesnt run
 AntiSquid: compare fair phone to regular phone
 MSmits: then you need to figure out how
 phamnuwen: VS one and only killer feature is the debugger for C++ imo
 MSmits: I dont have a smartphone AntiSquid
 MSmits: phamnuwen, you can also use C#. It is even more awesome for that
 AntiSquid: i still think the analogy helps
 AntiSquid: you carry a laptop around with you, so ya maybe you don't need the phone
 phamnuwen: MSmits will keep that in mind if I try C#, thanks
 MSmits: not because I carry a laptop AntiSquid
 MSmits: mainly because I dont want to talk to people :P
 AntiSquid: there's phone blocker for that
 phamnuwen: *he told cg chat*
 AntiSquid: block any number
 MSmits: sure, you can block all communications
 MSmits: but then its not really a phone anymore now is it
 eulerscheZahl: buy a phone, block the features of it
 MSmits: phamnuwen, outside of CG I know very few people that will talk to me about coding
 AntiSquid: and if you don't want to talk to anyone at a given moment, just disable calls and tell people later you had no signal
 MSmits: at every given moment in my case
 phamnuwen: haha
 MSmits: I'm basically a hermit teacher that only talks about coding when he's not working :P
 MSmits: and i like it that way&#160;:)
 Marchete: closet coder
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: I ain't coming out
 MSmits: btw I noticed langtons ant still has the bug
 MSmits: someone should fix it
 AntiSquid: what bug
 MSmits: RedStrike abuses it, though he'd be nr 1 without that
 MSmits: when the ant hits the edge of the map in game 1, the ant freezes in game 2
 MSmits: so if you're ahead when you freeze it in game 1, you win the game
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that didn't get fixed?
 MSmits: nope
 AntiSquid: lol
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440023458">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440023458</a>
 eulerscheZahl: langton can even be edited by anyone with lvl 29+ if we can't get M_C to correct it
 MSmits: I dont want to take the risk messing it up, havent done a contribution before
 MSmits: but basically, reset the freeze code at the start of every game
 MSmits: should be easy
 MSmits: shouldnt break any bots that abuse it
 MSmits: except they will lose some games

 Astrobytes: Hit 'Details'
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/rgozm4">https://prnt.sc/rgozm4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, that new bug which CG added on friday
 MSmits: oh right
 Astrobytes: Yeah lol
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling like it's always Friday when they decide to break stuff
 Astrobytes: Doesn't everyone push to the live server on Fridays? :P
 MSmits: there's a lot of French in the referee
 eulerscheZahl: only if you go on holidays after
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: comment: On fait avancer la fourmi
 MSmits: I now know what an ant is in French
 Astrobytes: Just think 'fourmi' and formic acid
 eulerscheZahl: i read it as "for me"
 eulerscheZahl: or "four me"? :frog: :frog: :frog: :frog:
 Astrobytes: Ants produce formic acid you see
 Astrobytes: that would be 'pour moi' or 'quatre de moi' euler 
 MSmits: hard to find a bug in a language I dont code in and a language I dont speak :P
 MSmits: i did find where it says the ant goes out of the grid, but i dont see any action being taken
 eulerscheZahl: you know C#, so you can read Java
 struct: Also you can't understand other's people code
 eulerscheZahl: that's the main problem
 MSmits: it's a problem, but the main problem is all the French variable names and comments
 eulerscheZahl: obfuscation
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but it seems like Astrobytes speaks some French?
 struct: you guys write your vars on your language?
 MSmits: no... English
 phamnuwen: no
 icecream17: YES!!! FINALLY!!!! (ignore this)
 eulerscheZahl: i name my vars in English
 Astrobytes: Non. Mon aéroglisseur est plein d'anguilles.
 MSmits: i know what that means
 eulerscheZahl: "No. My hovercraft is full of eels."?
 MSmits: you just said: My smell is bad, being an Englishman
 eulerscheZahl: either you write nonsense or deepl is broken
 Astrobytes: euler is correct. Monty Python reference
 MSmits: ow
 Astrobytes: The Hungarian phrasebook
 phamnuwen: Does the Monty Python stuff translate well into french?
 Astrobytes: Anyway, my French is a bit iffy these days
 Astrobytes: not sure tbh phamnuwen, I would imagine not
 struct: Do you need help with french?
 phamnuwen: MSmits might need some assistance, maybe you could translate the variables and comments from here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1989ad342413492aa8be19e50cd004de6311">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1989ad342413492aa8be19e50cd004de6311</a>

 dbdr: that page is broken for me, CG's javascript crashes apparently
 eulerscheZahl: click "details" at the top
 eulerscheZahl: known problem, since Friday
 dbdr: oh, details work, thanks
 MSmits: I know what to do to fix it eulerscheZahl, what do I do now, to avoid breaking anything
 dbdr: the referee is not on github?
 eulerscheZahl: set up a local project (i use IntelliJ, but you can also use eclipse, command line, ...)
 dbdr: that's more usable than the download
 eulerscheZahl: not on github
 MSmits: sounds complicated eulerscheZahl&#160;:(
 MSmits: can I not just tell one of you what to change
 MSmits: i've never made a java project
 eulerscheZahl: yes, tell M_C :D
 dbdr: github is nicer to casually browse the code, and also possible to fork and PR
 MSmits: don't think he's active
 MSmits: or he would have fixed it before
 MSmits: redstrike was discussing it months ago
 eulerscheZahl: send him a private message via forum, that triggers an email
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: good idea
 eulerscheZahl: no response within a few days =&gt; we fix it without M_C
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: a question of politeness, i wouldn't like any of you to modify my contributions without telling me either&#160;;)
 MSmits: of course not
 AntiSquid: oh maybe i should undo that edit then

 MSmits: ah yes of course. 
 dbdr: no tests it seems&#160;:(
 MSmits: I sent him the message. It's weird noone bothered before
 struct: Now don't find the bug in Yavalath
 MSmits: there is no bug&#160;:)
 dbdr: maybe everyone thought "someone should do it"&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah I suppose
 Astrobytes: someone did in the forum thread for it, a few people I believe
 MSmits: ah ok, but the creator might not read that. Good idea by euler to do a PM -&gt; mail
 Astrobytes: Yep, much better
 paolo_lsg: does anyone know what single possibility means in Defibrillators? 
 eulerscheZahl: text search didn't find "single possibility", give more context
 paolo_lsg: that was it.&#160;:(when testing Defibrillators in only got 75% i missed the first one which only says "Single Possibility". i don't see a way to get more details from it.
 eulerscheZahl: ah, it's the name of the first validator
 eulerscheZahl: share your code (paste it here)
 eulerscheZahl: my guess: radians/degrees conversion
 paolo_lsg: everything? hmm
 paolo_lsg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f4d661cf-58bc-4a50-8296-8c8093170995">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f4d661cf-58bc-4a50-8296-8c8093170995</a>
 paolo_lsg: oh cool, it just creates a link for the code
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't use the formula given in the description?
 paolo_lsg: no. i tried using the formula at first, but it didn't work for Complete file and Complete file 2. that's why i had to look for another formula.
 eulerscheZahl: the given formula works as expected
 eulerscheZahl: if you take another one, you might get slightly different results, thus a red validator
 eulerscheZahl: revert to the other formula and spot the bug
 paolo_lsg: alright, i'll try it again. thanks
 paolo_lsg: changed the formula to use the one given. it's working now. i probably just made a mistake before. but, i'm still stuck at single possibility.&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: would you mind sharing the code again?
 paolo_lsg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/672ed119-eefc-406f-b73f-f9786ed2bf2a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/672ed119-eefc-406f-b73f-f9786ed2bf2a</a>
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i get the same distances up to 10 or more decimal digits :thinking:
 paolo_lsg: oh ok. thanks. i'll look into precision.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm saying i have no idea why it's not working
 eulerscheZahl: not a precision problem
 paolo_lsg: i'm sniffing through the forums now. thanks for helping me. i'm new here.
 struct: Your code has a problem when having only 1 city
 paolo_lsg: well that was a big d'oh. just set N to 1. mine wasn't working because i had a Console Error Log which looks for the 2nd entry in my list. its all good now.
 JFB: paolo_lsg - I solved this puzle years ago so I do not remember exactly. But I have impresion that it was problem with ';' in one of adresses. So sometimes it was more fields after ';' parsing. So my solution get lat, lon from last and 2nd from the end fields
 JFB: I see that you get from last fields too. So it is not the problem. But you check do it is less than 5 fields and skip such lines. Try to comment out this line - maybe they are lines with less then 5 fields?
 paolo_lsg: yeah. thanks everyone. i was getting the last one. i deleted my other console logs for debugging and its working now. :D
 AntiSquid: no problem paolo_lsg
 MSmits: well I'm off work for 3 weeks...
 MSmits: they just decided to close the schools after all
 struct: Should I even round values on turn end of CSB
 reCurse: I don't get off that easy, still need to work remote
 struct: since they dont seem to do it in the referee?
 MSmits: i do too reCurse, but it's a lot less work than normally
 reCurse: They do round
 struct: MSmits but no classes via computer?
 MSmits: yeah, I'll produce some stuff and answer questions
 MSmits: but it's still a lot less work
 struct: Ok, I guess the leaked referee is not the one they are using
 MSmits: also, normally  I commute 2 hrs a day
 struct: Does the same apply to angles recurs e?
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: They give you round angles but still use the real one
 struct: Thanks
 struct: Easy to keep track
 reCurse: It's very difficult to get 100% simulation unless you use doubles
 reCurse: But then your perf sucks
 reCurse: Did CG just add security check to replays :o
 struct: Why do you think that?
 struct: about replays
 reCurse: Unauthorized access error
 struct: Maybe replays from validators?
 MSmits: did this happen on a batch reCurse
 MSmits: cg bench?
 reCurse: Replays from play button only work if you're logged in
 reCurse: Wasn't like that before
 struct: I think you needed to press share for it to become public
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: I 100% confirm that didn't work
 reCurse: Now it does though
 MSmits: share just makes a link
 MSmits: afaik
 reCurse: I think they added security check
 reCurse: So share might disable that now
 struct: The link is made on play
 MSmits: oh cool
 MSmits: thats how it should work
 reCurse: I guess
 reCurse: A bit annoying tho but we
 reCurse: w/e
 MadKnight: did u read that link MSmits&#160;?
 MadKnight: did u at least start&#160;?
 reCurse: Yay I fixed my exploitation resistant training
 dbdr: reCurse so what's the verdict? replays only accessible if you are logged in, or...?
 JFB: MSmits - in my country they will oficially close school from Monday - but it looks that, seeing what is going on in Italy, schools stopped from Friday at least. I was not sure do it is good move - becouse at the start it was grands too loof for childres becouse parent went to work
 reCurse: For the play button, only if you're logged in
 reCurse: Probably nothing for public games like submits
 dbdr: OK
 MSmits: same here JFB, on monday
 MSmits: MadKnight, i only looked at the link. too much Russian and I don't like google translated text. Not even gonna try that
 JFB: But now it looks that more and more people it knowing that is better to work remotly or get leave from works to look for children. And I think that is possible, in worst case scenario, to convert schools into temporary hospitals
 MSmits: i liked the pics and got the gist of what it was about
 reCurse: 80% against old version, 89% against smits but only 65% against robo
 reCurse: Oh well can't win them all
 MSmits: still oware reCurse?
 Omnium: is Spain they are converting hotels into hospitals
 reCurse: Yeah...
 reCurse: The really annoying thing with ML is any bug is really just adding noise
 reCurse: So everything still works
 reCurse: But less well
 MSmits: dont worry too much about the winrate vs me.... it's gonna change at some point. But I won't submit spam you just to bring you down if i happen to be 50% + I only try for nr1 if i can stay there even when others submit
 MadKnight: MSmits but the pics are in en
 JFB: Omnium - in Spain they have a lot of hotels -
 reCurse: Well I don't exactly have that many benchmarks
 reCurse: Take what I have :P
 reCurse: I'm more interested into being less exploitattive
 reCurse: So more stable
 struct: Just ask MSmits for the code
 struct: Then you can run more
 reCurse: I think the new training has proved itself
 MSmits: well the thing is, your nn is likely going to be much better vs rank 4 and down than mine is, even if mine beats you over 50% at some point. That has been my experience since the start for both you and Robo, the NN's are more versatile against different bots
 reCurse: Maybe more versatile but also exploitable
 reCurse: Hopefully I fixed the latter
 MSmits: I would win 80% and you would win 95% is what i mean
 reCurse: Yeah I know
 MSmits: kk
 reCurse: Wish I had more insight on that
 MSmits: I had too much of that. I am not looking forward to doing much more fitting, it's not a lot of fun. I only persisted because I had a lot of success with it... but for small gains its not worth it
 MadKnight: MSmits just look at the pics, they're informative and in en
 MSmits: they are MadKnight, but I am not currently learning. When I try to learn about a subject I go all out. Not just look at some pics. We established I will do this over the summer&#160;:)
 MSmits: gonna go get some food while it's quiet in the supermarket. 
 MSmits: ttyl
 AntiSquid: the kung fu trainer sent an email about doing classes over skype instead of attending in person 
 Scarfield: Dont try to break the board he is holding!
 AntiSquid: i never seen anyone break stuff . it's just the usual kung fu dance you can watch on youtube btw, you learn a pattern, i just do it to keep fit
 Scarfield: i prefere eating heavy cookies
 Astrobytes: I follow a strict Kung Pao regimen
 Scarfield: For CSB how is the velocities changed when a collision has less then 120 impulse?
 MadKnight: it just sets impulse to 120
 MadKnight: and applies 120 impulse on bounce
 Scarfield: i have tried to extend the vel vector, and adding the needed vel change along the contact angle, but neither seems to be correct
 MadKnight: it actually applies 2 impulses - first to stop pods, second to bounce them
 MadKnight: u gotta set second to 120
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3176d2b-abdd-4b82-a7b5-3c3da1658ba6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3176d2b-abdd-4b82-a7b5-3c3da1658ba6</a>
 MadKnight: yea that's how u set it
 eulerscheZahl: reCurse  05:49PMI think they added security check
 Scarfield: okay, so it extends the after collision vector right?
 struct: I think he means other thing
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits congrats to your gained spare time
 Scarfield: along its own length
 struct: He is saying that replays that are generated once you press play my code
 struct: are not public anymore
 dbdr: inb4 massive MSmits gains&#160;:)
 reCurse: Crap I should have gotten around to those ML validators before then
 struct: Don't know if sarcasm or not :thinking:
 reCurse: It's not, ML validators are not the same as tests
 AntiSquid: validators protected? did they change them at least + resub everything?
 reCurse: More of a side effect of added security on replays
 AntiSquid: ah you can't share IDE replays anymore?&#160;:/
 reCurse: You need to click the share button now I think
 reCurse: Didn't test
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440177755">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440177755</a> IDE replay

 AntiSquid: new
 AntiSquid: well i crashed coz editing stuff
 AntiSquid: messy old code 
 eulerscheZahl: i downloaded the marslander validators in the past, but never progressed any further <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gofile.io/?c=jDDvFV">https://gofile.io/?c=jDDvFV</a>
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even filter for mars lander replays, so that's all kind of other stuff with similar replay ID
 eulerscheZahl: RIP CG sponsored contest validators, i never downloaded them
 AntiSquid: didn't someone say those always change?
 AntiSquid: or that there's some randomness in there
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: something like this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/758100a939c77b58a4a37fc56ab749a6cbced5">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/758100a939c77b58a4a37fc56ab749a6cbced5</a>
 eulerscheZahl: only for bulls and cows
 eulerscheZahl: psst, we don't talk about the reverse game
 AntiSquid: then i missunderstood the game
 eulerscheZahl: back when schubc reached #1, he generated about 15k testcases
 eulerscheZahl: and passed every single one of them
 eulerscheZahl: test = predict AI movements for given board
 reCurse: Thanks euler
 AntiSquid: 15k @_@
 eulerscheZahl: so it's pretty deterministic
 AntiSquid: anyways wonder why they never released the pacman game
 eulerscheZahl: maybe some company hackathon, no idea
 eulerscheZahl: probably never planned to be visible, just by accident
 eulerscheZahl: and there was a captain sonar game, looked pretty finished too
 eulerscheZahl: broken now (pixi.js update)
 AntiSquid: cg_ lizard avatar guy wanted to make a contest out of it
 eulerscheZahl: CG Rom?
 reCurse: Oh it's not your contrib?
 eulerscheZahl: out of the captain sonar?
 AntiSquid: yes
 eulerscheZahl: jupoulton uploaded the pacman
 eulerscheZahl: accidentally as public for a few minutes
 AntiSquid: no reCurse, i sniped it, was only briefly available
 eulerscheZahl: i completely missed it, but squiddy downloaded the zip
 eulerscheZahl: (thanks for that)
 reCurse: Looks kinda neat

 struct: hi
 FlyingCube_b2fc: I'm starting learn javascript
 MSmits: sorry to hear that&#160;:(
 MSmits: hope you feel better soon
 FlyingCube_b2fc: Why?
 MSmits: I'm just messing with you. 
 MSmits: JS is not the nicest language to work with
 struct: at least he doesnt have to deal with avx
 struct: going crazy
 AntiSquid: FlyingCube_b2fc just use whatever you enjoy
 AntiSquid: this place won't help you learn the most important features of JS though, since you won't need them here
 struct: Cant that be said for most of languages?
 AntiSquid: yes
 MrKrakus: I only try new method learn JS
 MrKrakus: Because, I take part on course
 MrKrakus: On the udemy 
 MrKrakus: And today, I 
 AntiSquid: omg
 AntiSquid: wtf
 AntiSquid: why udemy&#160;?
 MrKrakus: I watch youtuber 
 AntiSquid: but it's filled with crap
 MrKrakus: And he was there course 
 AntiSquid: are you paying too?
 MrKrakus: Yes
 MrKrakus: Not to much]
 MrKrakus: How you learning?
 Omnium: you learn by doing
 AntiSquid: NOT UDEMY
 Omnium: you have a crusade against them?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: they're crap
 AntiSquid: and he is paying lol
 Omnium: hvent tried. just doing things while uni
 AntiSquid: when there's ample free alternatives and even better paid alternatives if you really want to pay
 MSmits: mmh so my boss nominated me to be an ict specialist to help my colleagues teach from home :P
 Omnium: home is awesome. I prefer doing online uni than going there
 MSmits: and I go to work tomorrow after all, probably dealing with this
 AntiSquid: you'll make a great patsy if shit hits the fan
 struct: Im gonna ditch cache for now
 struct: ón collisions
 MSmits: nah it's just helping out, no responsibility other than trying your best
 struct: its not very important on csb anyways
 MSmits: also shit hitting the fan is a different virus
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: Astrobytes knows this, he is a specialist
 eulerscheZahl: noro virus
 struct: omfg
 struct: What a nice bug
 MSmits: thats one yeah
 struct: I cant even copy paste 
 eulerscheZahl: my grandma brought it to her retirement castle when she got there
 MSmits: that may have killed some people =/
 eulerscheZahl: a few days later everyone had to stay in their own room
 Astrobytes: You have castles for the elderly in DE?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm not a native speaker and remembered that name from the simpsons
 eulerscheZahl: Abe lives there
 Astrobytes: ofc, haha yes indeed he does
 eulerscheZahl: so, how should i call it?
 MSmits: home
 Astrobytes: Just retirement home
 eulerscheZahl: teach me new vocabulary
 MSmits: retirement home
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 Astrobytes: I liked the Simpsons reference though
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree that's how i learned English
 eulerscheZahl: by watching TV
 MSmits: same
 Astrobytes: Yup, I know a lot of people who did that
 MSmits: my daughter watches every dvd in English, French and Dutch.. dunno why 
 Astrobytes: Ever watched the Simpsons in French? That's some trip
 MSmits: she just decides she knows it in one language and picks a different one
 eulerscheZahl: but she also sings in Chinese
 Astrobytes: That's awesome though MSmits
 MSmits: yeah there was a time where she would just use chinese words
 eulerscheZahl: i don't speak French at allso i didn't watch the Simpsons in Fr
 MSmits: from ni hao kai lan
 Astrobytes: When  I was last in France I watched it, from the theme tune to the end I was like WTF
 MSmits: is it different from other French stuff?
 eulerscheZahl: bad dubbing?voices totally different?
 struct: Portuguese don't really dub stuff
 MSmits: we dont either
 struct: at least pt-pt
 struct: pt-br dub a lot
 Astrobytes: The voices, yes, they were hilarious
 eulerscheZahl: in the german version they tried to get the voices as close as possible to the original
 struct: I can't watch dubed movies
 AntiSquid: MSmits does she use the correct intonation? :p
 AntiSquid: that's the key to actually speaking propoer "chinese"
 MSmits: i know for English, not sure if her Chinese was
 MSmits: probably not
 eulerscheZahl: someone recorded the TV&#160;:/ but shows German Homer<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNXsrZZN3vg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNXsrZZN3vg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: sadly he died a few years ago
 Astrobytes: not bad!
 Astrobytes: Actually some of the French voices are OK I guess<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTn8Z65rc4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTn8Z65rc4s</a>
 Astrobytes: I mean, Marge sounds like she was just sent from Hell or something
 eulerscheZahl: the big guy at 0:54 (frederic taytum?) has the voice of a child
 AntiSquid: Marge = chain smokerBart = very girly
 Astrobytes: Drederick yeah lol, didn't quite capture his 'essence'
 Astrobytes: Lisa sounds OK
 eulerscheZahl: it's usual that kids are spoken by women
 eulerscheZahl: bart = nancy cartwrite in the US version
 eulerscheZahl: scientologist iirc
 Astrobytes: Homer OK at points, Wiggum terrible, Milhouse not bad
 eulerscheZahl: wiggum too deep
 eulerscheZahl: should swap with frederic
 eulerscheZahl: not good but better that way
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 AntiSquid: is that show still running?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: but i stopped watching it
 eulerscheZahl: not funny anymore
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even remember the plot 30min after i watched it
 Astrobytes: They just recycle old stuff. I gave up on it years ago now
 eulerscheZahl: same
 Astrobytes: It had a great run though
 AntiSquid: and futurama?
 eulerscheZahl: cancelled
 eulerscheZahl: twice
 AntiSquid: i didn't like the newer episodes, forgot why
 eulerscheZahl: i liked the new ones too
 Astrobytes: I don't think they made any bad Futurama episodes tbh
 eulerscheZahl: worst simpsons episode (at least before i stopped watching): All Singing, All Dancing
 eulerscheZahl: for Futurama i don't remember a no-go
 eulerscheZahl: the dog waiting for Fry made me sad
 Astrobytes: That was a clip show right? Of all the songs
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 struct: x = 13872 and y = -5067, while pod is at 5620 2598
 struct: close enough
 Astrobytes: Yeah that was pretty crap
 miszu: QQ, what system is running the C++? Is it a 64 bit one?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 miszu: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that CG has any 32bit CPUs
 miszu: just sanity check, I am using a pool so thinking should I use pointer or a number to represent the index. pointer size is bigger than int32 size
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 eulerscheZahl: "Your program is compiled and run in a Linux environment on a 64bit multi-core architecture."
 Astrobytes: beat me to it... again
 eulerscheZahl: but you only have a single core for your process
 Astrobytes: even though we get pthread
 miszu: I don't think multithreading would help muchhere
 eulerscheZahl: others tried, not worth the effort
 dbdr: wow, eulerscheZahl #2 in optim, gg
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: must be bulls and cows
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/optim/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/optim/global</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even realize
 eulerscheZahl: got 304 as well
 miszu: I am 3 269 xD
 eulerscheZahl: my best offline was 290
 dbdr: yeah, though it cannot be that many points yet
 struct: should be CvZ
 eulerscheZahl: last time i checked, i was 3 or 4 points below marcheteonly played the bulls after
 eulerscheZahl: and still very close
 dbdr: ah yes, if you were that close...
 dbdr: by the way, when you did A*C offline, did you ever get to #1?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: for 10min maybe, then Neumann got me back
 dbdr: lol
 kovi: hardcoders...
 eulerscheZahl: my real score should be around 10.6k
 eulerscheZahl: had a discussion with neumann how easy it is to hardcode, he said that it's still an achievement
 dbdr: offline is real&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i told him that i can easily get the validators and become #1
 dbdr: because Neumann used a much hard method, right?
 dbdr: but once you have the validators, it's still hard to optimize
 eulerscheZahl: the point is: only 3 or 4 players are playing offline, so it's an unfair comparison
 Neumann: Those damn hardcoders ..  grrrr .. They even gather and organize competitions dedicated to hardcoding. They call it hashcode. What a bunch of losers
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Neumann: I'd rather spam my rng-based search and hope for a lucky hi-score
 Neumann: LUL
 kovi: well, true
 Neumann:&#160;:)
 kovi: cg system is not proper for optim
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine with hardcoding, when everyone gets the validators (same chances for everyone)
 Neumann: I agree on the "unfair" factor tho
 eulerscheZahl: i heavily agree with kovi
 dbdr: well, NS is pretty fair
 Neumann: lol
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder: validators during the contest
 eulerscheZahl: then a huge rerun with other testcases for final standings
 eulerscheZahl: only takes 2 weeks to get the final results :rolling_eyes:
 kovi: ns. yeah, it is hardcode for everyone
 kovi: topcoder - but it is still a time limited contest. with a single final run
 eulerscheZahl: the most fair solution: regular resubmit with new testcasesbut that would require a lot of CPU time, completely unreasonable for CG
 Neumann: We're having this discussion every 3 weeks for 2 years now
 eulerscheZahl: so hardcoding would be acceptable IMO (see hashcode), if the validators were more accessible
 dbdr: I think 50% of CG CPU is spent on CSB alone :D
 eulerscheZahl: i just silently accept that CG and optim don't fit well
 eulerscheZahl: can be fun solving the puzzles, but i don't play for a "fair" ranking, however that should be defined
 dbdr: it's also fun to find the ways to go around the system
 dbdr: e.g. what we did on CGfunge
 eulerscheZahl: i never thought about unicode to load large numbers
 dbdr: that's similar to what goes on in computer security, in a simple way

 Astrobytes: And lol JBM
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i tend to use the first turn
 JBM: yeah we all do
 Astrobytes: AguliRojo Get rid of this:  || x &lt;39 || y &lt;17
 AntiSquid: just use while(1)
 AguliRojo: Yeah i did right of the bat
 AntiSquid: yeah
 AguliRojo: replaced with and statement
 AntiSquid: with bitwise and&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, leave it as while(true)
 AguliRojo: but didnt realised i had to add to change variable on every move
 BenjaminUrquhart: the classic thor mistake
 BenjaminUrquhart: not updating coords

 BenjaminUrquhart: one off more like 2 off everywhere
 BenjaminUrquhart: because it is
 Astrobytes: AguliRojo DEFINITELY start with the easy puzzles before you attempt something in the Bot Programming section
 AntiSquid: just do CSB AguliRojo
 Astrobytes: MadSquid

 AguliRojo: I dont know where to find those , are they under Learn tab?
 Astrobytes: RATM? Rage Against The Manual?

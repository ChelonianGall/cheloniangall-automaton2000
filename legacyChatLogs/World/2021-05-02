 Shmayro: java
 Miki09: I'm sorry. I can't help you with java.
 Shmayro: ok thanks , i will try :D , i have just the first Test right
 jacek: good morning
 Shmayro: hello
 Alex-1: hi jacek
 KiwiTae: you guys never sleep?
 Shmayro: Said the one who didn't sleep
 NandishGupta: Where do I report a question with incorrect test values?
 jacek: is it puzzle or clash?
 NandishGupta: puzzle
 jacek: you could try puzzle discussion. but is it really incorrect?
 jacek: what puzzle?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hiiiiiiii! I found a bug in "the descent" where can I report it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Srsly?! No one? This site really su*** I better leave to *insert some other programming site here*! 
 geppoz: well you have a nice icon beside your name and ask to us? :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Your laughing at me?! What an helpful guy you are! I gonna write a 5 pages lament on the forum and quit forever!
 jacek: and no one noticed i rotated again&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh! Jacek! You rotated again! Amazing! :o
 jacek: i shall rotate 1 degree per day from now on
 IvesL: can we see any seasonal changes from you
 Eatyaveges: hello everyone, can i ask what happens in the Spring Challenge?  is it specific challenges or just any?
 BlaiseEbuth: What do you mean by "just any"&#160;?
 geppoz: it is known if it is 1vs1 or multiplayer?
 geppoz: board game or physics?
 geppoz: there was any leak?&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: We know there's totoros
 geppoz: y, nice
 geppoz: I already prepared a function getTotoro(){ ... }

 victortwc: Good Sunday morning&#160;:) 
 BlaiseEbuth: Sunday, bloody sunday...
 Passifi: Blaise has to retraumatize all the irish people in chat tsts
 BlaiseEbuth: There's none...
 jacek: because you traumatized them
 BlaiseEbuth: Because they are at the mass
 Passifi: Now with the racism... irish people can code if you give them scratch .. so please tone down your prejudice
 Alex-1: hii to all
 Passifi: hi 
 Alex-1: How are you Passifi
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth slaps Passifi around a bit with a large SJW.</b></p><p><img src="/a/62123501064369" /> Alex-1: :smile:
 Alex-1: slaps
 Alex-1: Covid-19 is spreading fastly
 Alex-1: :cry:
 Passifi: I am okay. I suppose. nostalgic because I have not seen this * xy does something. way of communicating in chat since the early 2000s 
 Passifi: it slowed down in allemania and large parts of europe so the good part of the world is safe dont worry&#160;:)
 geppoz: yesterday I got my 2nd dose of vaccine
 Alex-1: nice are you healthy geppoze after the vaccination
 geppoz: fine, only pain in the arm, cant lift it over the shoulder, but ok
 Passifi: you got sick&#160;? the woman living under me got a pretty bad reaction after the second dose. No of course she just strouts around and lets strangers spit in her mouth for fun oh these vaccinted people
 BlaiseEbuth: New variants, situation out of control in India, supposed "developed" european countries like France that are not abble to manage the epidemic or to have enough doses of vaccine, and millions of deaths. But yeah, world's safe... 
 Passifi: I see you are a baguette half eaten kind of person
 Passifi: llok at it this way if Boris Britain was able to turn this ship around. The man who seduced his teacher succesfully, should be doing fine eventually&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: I prefer see the reality and act in consequence instead of lying to me by saying that all is fine.
 Alex-1: :smile:
 BlaiseEbuth: No. In UK politics apologized to the people. In France politics say this is the people fault.
 Alex-1: yeah that a big reason BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Since a year everybody in France feels like he's living in a parody...
 Alex-1: Why are you silent Passifi
 BlaiseEbuth: The only remaining incertitude is to know if our government is incompetent or criminal... :thinking:
 Alex-1: :thinking:
 Passifi: well I think that feeling is shared all over the world. In germany the authorities only hint at it being the peoples fault though, some policitian said if we open up things like outdoor sports its gonna lead to wild swinger parties on the streets... being treated like children hasn't helped the situation much ... 
 Alex-1: yeah they are right
 Alex-1: Passifi
 AntiSquid: did i mention i had to self isolate and was asymptomatic? i literally didn't feel any difference LOL 
 Alex-1: :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: NEET...
 Westicles: A flu where you don't know if you are sick unless you are tested, and have to be blackmailed to get vaccinated
 Passifi: oh I am certain its incompetence, to be fair I think this situation is pretty much impossible to handle either way you gonna tear a big hole in your society... I don't really think our politcal system had the right tools or characters to deal with this well
 AntiSquid: ya, i got text message from my doctor telling me i can book a vax appointment when i want Westicles
 Alex-1: yeah healthy people don't get much effected by the disease
 Westicles: AntiSquid, are you gonna get it?
 AntiSquid: although the report stated something like: antibodies found could be from previous infection or vaccine
 AntiSquid: they can't tell whether i had the vaccine or not based on their test, i don't see the point in getting the vax 
 geppoz: unfortunately this is not just a problem of politics or incompetence or disorganization, the way the human race spread so massively on the planet is just matematically the right way to let the evolution do its job and create our "predator"
 geppoz: it is math, nothing else
 BlaiseEbuth: Get the dose and sell it to black market!
 Alex-1: :smile:
 AntiSquid: or make a breaking bad style business
 Westicles: black market?  they are reducing hours here because nobody wants it
 Alex-1: BlaiseEbuth :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the point Westicles: sell it to other countries
 Alex-1: help other
 Westicles: You guys all have plenty of Sputnik, right?  I'm sure that's perfectly safe 
 BlaiseEbuth: In France the vaccination is only open to the elder, but there's no more who goes. But the government does not want to open vaccination to younger people. So the doses just stay in fridges...
 Alex-1: like above the 45 age
 AntiSquid: sounds like some kind of DMT  (sputnik) :D
 Alex-1: Contest is really near 
 Westicles: You should just have 'national kiss a stranger day' and get this nonsense over once and for all

 Passifi: oh i didn't know this happende when you type a lot ^^
 Passifi: interesting&#160;:)
 Alex-1: :smile:
 AntiSquid: Westicles to be perfectly honest, without the test i would have never known i had it
 XFREEMAN: Hi, a newbie here. Can we import/require a package in Javascript here?
 AntiSquid: from what i remember you had to copy the entire thing and minify it
 AntiSquid: then add it to your code
 AntiSquid: for JS XFREEMAN
 Alex-1: AntiSquid sad you have symptoms of Covid-19
 Alex-1: Westicles to be perfectly honest, without the test i would have never known i had it
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a> 
 AntiSquid: Alex-1 i never said that, practice reading comprehension
 Passifi: people asking you about your covid symptoms is in the faq&#160;? You are one popular cookie antiSquid 
 AntiSquid: duckduckgo the definition of asymptomatic 
 AntiSquid: was linking faq for the guy who asked about javascript 
 AntiSquid: was about to mention it only says it has node 14
 BlaiseEbuth: The site said to me "ObjectiveC Fan", then "C# Fan"... I'm really starting to feel insulted...
 Alex-1: Passifi mis understanding
 Alex-1: :smile:
 Passifi: not really alex irony just don't travel well over the interweb
 Alex-1: okk Passifi
 AntiSquid: i wasn't sure due to context, making that comment after alex
 Alex-1: context :thinking:
 Alex-1: you mean contest Antisquid
 AntiSquid: no
 Alex-1: okk guys i am solving Don't panic any idea for me
 BlaiseEbuth: Focus and don't speak
 Alex-1: What :no_mouth:
 AntiSquid: what is the correct spelling Alex-1&#160;?`hi` or `hii` please answer
 Alex-1: hi
 AntiSquid: you sure? :thinking:you can pick the other one if you want
 Passifi: listen to Don't speak by No doubt alex and the answer will come, don't know what the focus thing is about
 Alex-1: yeah i know
 Alex-1: but when i type hii a read line goes under hii that means it wrong
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 BlaiseEbuth: Crime of stupidity?
 AntiSquid: just wanted to make sure it's him

 synchoz: i hate that C# is so limited on calculations XD 
 BlaiseEbuth: I hate C#
 jacek: then why are you wearing glasses
 synchoz: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't
 jacek: so you C# by default
 Manchi_o6o7: can someone help me debugg some C code
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/k75DKsmx">https://pastebin.com/k75DKsmx</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: it should count letters in a word, recursively
 PatrickMcGinnisII: manchi, that's a mess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &gt;='z'
 jacek: says the php guy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i doesn't magically change
 Manchi_o6o7: I changed it to &lt;='z'
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well php has is_alpha()
 Manchi_o6o7: C has also, but I am trying to implement it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well your not sending a substr, you seem to be looking at an infinite function calls and coounting char at pos 0 forever
 Manchi_o6o7: hmmm but isn't i increasing after checking the position
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u set it to 0 every func call
 struct: if(i==strlen(str))return 0;
 Manchi_o6o7: isn't static meaning that it will change every time
 struct: you will always return 0
 struct: return counter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^
 Manchi_o6o7: return counter, still the same
 struct: on second you want to increase
 struct: i
 struct: on the else
 struct: you want to increase i not counter
 Manchi_o6o7: still nothing
 struct: paste code here that compiles
 struct: and ill try to help
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, didn't see static
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/680befe1-1297-4b57-9a87-fc72e23202bb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/680befe1-1297-4b57-9a87-fc72e23202bb</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if(i==strlen(str))return counter;
 struct: return counter
 Manchi_o6o7: nothing
 synchoz: and make in the else i++;
 struct: it worked for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why am i up at 7am on a sunday
 Manchi_o6o7: really
 struct: yes
 struct: i also changed char word
 struct: to char*word
 Manchi_o6o7: the pointer is the problem...
 Manchi_o6o7: but why
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d3ee919-6888-4ab3-8239-fd324c98f037">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d3ee919-6888-4ab3-8239-fd324c98f037</a>
 struct: This works
 struct: you cant just do char w = "asdasdada"
 synchoz: const*&#160;?
 synchoz: char * word
 struct: You either do char *word = "awsdas" or char word[] = "asfsafsaf"
 synchoz: and yeah u didnt increase ur [i] it was stuck in a loop 
 Manchi_o6o7: yes, I got it. It was just one char the way I wrote it.
 Manchi_o6o7: thank you guys
 Astrobytes: I quite like returning 0 after doing all the counting though, that was a classic&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm gonna return my NULL ass to bed
 Manchi_o6o7: is there any other approach recursively, to get through the string. With the given prototype of the function
 PatrickMcGinnisII: with const *, doubt it
 Manchi_o6o7: why is the const making problems
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's not, it saving you from a bunch of memory hogging
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but with just a char* and sending a substring, the function can be totally rewritten into like 2 lines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all of it is wrong imho, but it';s an example for static vars
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I'll shutup
 PatrickMcGinnisII: var scope can be a sumbitch
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 PatrickMcGinnisII: goodday all
 Manchi_o6o7: hmmm but without a static variable
 Manchi_o6o7: is there some way
 struct: yes
 struct: if you pass the i and the counter
 struct: as parameters
 Manchi_o6o7: but if I have only *str in the prototype?
 Manchi_o6o7: as the parameter
 struct: I think so
 struct: maybe not
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b2f651f6-4c58-4008-becf-9c6eae17c6bd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b2f651f6-4c58-4008-becf-9c6eae17c6bd</a>
 RoboStac: though I've no idea why you'd want it to be recursive as it's much simpler as a loop
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/40a75b30-5641-4ecd-b3dd-b3dda2cc0904">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/40a75b30-5641-4ecd-b3dd-b3dda2cc0904</a>
 struct: this way you dont have to have counter
 Manchi_o6o7: robostac
 Manchi_o6o7: When does it stop, I mean *str==0?
 Astrobytes: I'm assuming this is homework or study
 Manchi_o6o7: I am studying, yes
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca637d24-ac6f-4a02-8f9a-a0739c8e4410">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca637d24-ac6f-4a02-8f9a-a0739c8e4410</a>
 struct: This way you dont need static vars
 RoboStac: in c the end of a string is a null character (strlen works the same way)
 Astrobytes: Thought so, given the constraint on the prototype
 jacek: could write == '\0' though
 Astrobytes: Manchi_o6o7: you could also do str[i]=='\0'
 Manchi_o6o7: yes, got it
 jacek: slowbytes
 Manchi_o6o7: thank you very much guys

 Donald_D._Doge: did the recent update kill D&#160;?
 struct: Wasn't it already dead?
 Donald_D._Doge: if i don't like the game i intend to play with alt and D instead, but if D is borked ...
 Westicles: They fixed it already
 struct: Im sure the game will please some people
 Donald_D._Doge: it always does
 Donald_D._Doge: depends who is louder though at the end of the contest
 Astrobytes: I have a feeling I'll be on the fence about it. Going by the last few.
 Donald_D._Doge: i am surprised the last one didn't appeal to the hardcore love-my-sim-hardcore-wtf crowd
 struct: I enjoyed last one
 Astrobytes: It was miles better than the pacman one, I still enjoyed it, but it didn't do much for me
 struct: not hard though
 struct: even amazons would do a better job than pac
 AntiSquid: OOC &gt; pacman &gt; spice_girls
 AntiSquid: for me
 struct: You think pacman is better than the Spring one?
 AntiSquid: pacman is the spring one
 Astrobytes: OOC &gt; spice_girls &gt; pacman
 struct: fall i mean
 struct: FB &gt; *
 AntiSquid: i didn't enjoy it, but then again didn't have much time for it, out of all CG contests i spent least time on that one
 AntiSquid: at contest time 
 struct: I spent more time understanding pac collisions than on the game
 AntiSquid: 1 day&#160;?
 struct: probably
 AntiSquid: OOC i spent a lot on but then tried random stupid stuff on it
 struct: OOC I wanted to try bitboards but I was not good enough so I quit
 AntiSquid: like the double NN pipeline which failed :D
 Astrobytes: I was on too many painkillers during OOC to properly enjoy it, I must revisit. It was a cool game.
 Astrobytes: Fog of war with purpose.
 struct: Next one must have fog surely
 KiwiTae: i don't like fog :3
 AntiSquid: hardest wood :Dconsidering number of people stuck in there
 KiwiTae: OOC stands for?
 struct: ocean of code
 KiwiTae: oooh
 AntiSquid: wait no it's not @_@
 KiwiTae: lmao
 Astrobytes: I thought XR was hardest wood
 AntiSquid: the fall contest has highest wood count :D
 AntiSquid: thought that was an easy game
 AntiSquid: to start at least
 struct: I was first in bronze I think
 struct: I will be first in bronze this time aswell
 struct:&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: i remember struggling vs code royal wood1 boss
 AntiSquid: struct how about instead of DELETE if not legend, just use D&#160;! better bet imo
 struct: too late to use D
 struct: Im too far now
 AntiSquid: too far in what way @_@
 AntiSquid: confused
 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: He's beyond the use of the D
 AntiSquid: ya that's why if he fails ...
 Astrobytes: A transcendental state fi ever there was one.
 Astrobytes: *if, ffs, I'm not writing bash
 struct: If D array index starts at 1
 struct: Ill use it
 KalamariKing: Why ARE there so many languages?
 struct: No idea
 dreadylein: because mine is better, no mine is better
 AntiSquid: you have a few on your profile KalamariKing
 struct: Only C++ should be listed
 struct: Nothing else
 Astrobytes: Switch uppa D fi de Lua
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid yeah but something like lolcats. Why is it a thing
 DomiKo: struct and python for puzzles
 AntiSquid: sometimes you stray from the bright streets and venture into a dark side-street where you are forced to even use VB.net
 dreadylein: :D
 struct: fair enough
 Astrobytes: Many languages, many problems, much choice. 
 struct: I saw that you got rank 2 on hypersonic grats DomiKo
 Astrobytes: Choose the right tool for the job
 DomiKo: yeah
 DomiKo: but its very close 
 Astrobytes: Oh nice DomiKo
 AntiSquid: quite sure you can drop since hypersonic is random :P
 DomiKo: not that much
 struct: random bettwen rank 10 and 100 maybe
 AntiSquid: wasn't smitz 1st there&#160;?
 struct: where all the bots are the same
 Astrobytes: Beam or a different approach DomiKo?
 DomiKo: random between 1-5
 AntiSquid: even top 10 is random
 struct: Downside of 4 player games
 AntiSquid: not sure about karlizo
 DomiKo: i don't know about siman
 AntiSquid: you just pinged siman, should misspell siman's name instead of typing it out
 DomiKo: only top 5 is shuffling
 DomiKo: ohhh 
 DomiKo: Astrobytes Beam ofc
 AntiSquid: saw Marshete higher
 Astrobytes: Depends if you want him to explain or not, karliso usually explains if pinged
 struct: What was the other guy name?
 struct: I cant remember
 struct: he had beam search type like algorithm
 DomiKo: I know that I and simen done like 500 submits
 struct: The guy that got legend in 1 day
 DomiKo: soo
 struct: choku
 AntiSquid: chokudai 
 struct: chokudai
 Astrobytes: oh chokudai
 AntiSquid: 8 hours actually (someone insisted)
 AntiSquid: i didn't stalk leaderboard that long
 DomiKo: I can say that in 1 vs 1 I can beat everyone except Karlisu
 DomiKo: he is soooo strong
 struct: Maybe he uses chokudaisearch
 DomiKo: width isn't the problem
 DomiKo: I don't use fixed width too
 Astrobytes: width based on some score range?
 DomiKo: I would say that width is just a bound 
 DomiKo: and the most important part is to prune a lot of state 
 Astrobytes: Makes sense
 DomiKo: I have some ideas, but I will try them after the contest
 DomiKo: maybe one day I will get 50% against current leader
 Astrobytes: I have faith
 DomiKo: because right now my highest is 48%  in about 1K games
 struct: What was chokudai for again?
 struct: I cant exactly remember
 AntiSquid: so you sim best mioves for opponents or not @_@ DomiKo
 Astrobytes: Was the jp puyo-puyo contest no?
 AntiSquid: or you give them some random&#160;? some rule-based picks&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The one with numbered balls
 DomiKo: AntiSquid I'm prepared for many things 
 struct: o.o
 DomiKo: you can watch some me vs Karlisu
 AntiSquid: i am just asking how you pick the moves for opp in your search
 DomiKo: you will see some magic sometimes
 Astrobytes: Trade secret AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: it doesn't show in replays 
 DomiKo: I pick 2-3 moves for them 
 DomiKo: with same beamsearch
 DomiKo: and based on 10K games I can predict like 80% moves of top10 players
 DomiKo: ~80%
 AntiSquid: so everyone except for you and karlizo
 DomiKo: but choosing one sequence of moves for opponents isn't enough&#160;:( 
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/545241845">https://www.codingame.com/replay/545241845</a>
 DomiKo: it's a nice replay
 KalamariKing: So its a bot-powered GameOfBombs
 AntiSquid: see you on contest day :D
 AntiSquid: gn8
 KalamariKing: This'll be my first contest, could someone explain how it works?
 KalamariKing: Is it a bot battles thing?
 struct: yes
 KalamariKing: Oh I suck at those, ok thanks
 DomiKo: you have 11 days to learn it
 DomiKo: so good luck
 KalamariKing: Thanks
 KiwiTae: KalamariKing its ok , try your best and learn from it
 KalamariKing: Lol yeah I expect to lose, but learn
 Enknable: 11 days?
 Enknable: i thought it started on the 6th
 KiwiTae: ull surely suck less than others if you practice one bot programming before then
 DomiKo: contest last 11 days
 KalamariKing: It does, but its 11 days long
 Enknable: oh right right
 Enknable: learning on the job
 Enknable:&#160;:)
 struct: Last contest I had no idea what Beam search was
 struct: I talked with someone and learned it in under 5 minutes
 KiwiTae: and now you throw beams 
 Astrobytes: I just read that as beans, fml
 struct: build taking so long :zzz:
 Astrobytes: What are you building
 struct: The code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bean holder
 struct: 55k chars
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: I have now flicked the bean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what's new peepz?
 struct: Windows dev build is full off bugs
 struct: this was a mistake&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what's next contest gonna be?
 Astrobytes: Bean flicking.
 struct: im not allowed to say sry
 p0int3r: :flag_ma:
 Astrobytes: Are you still having issues with that struct?
 struct: im still on it yes
 struct: Maybe im just dumb
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I hope it doesn't involve PI
 Astrobytes: This *is* windows we're talking about so keep an open mind
 struct: Ctrl shift switches my keyboard layout
 struct: despite being disabled
 Astrobytes: How about Magnum PI tho
 struct: Night light doesnt work half the time
 struct: Random fonts in menus for no reason
 Astrobytes: Localisation issues?
 struct: If I wasnt on dev build i would think I had a virus
 struct: The keybind to switch is disabled
 struct: but it still switches
 struct: 10/10
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i have an app that defaults to chinese in windows... have to change everytime i open it
 Astrobytes: Definitely seems like locale issues, you should report this stuff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: has to do with app being registered to user instead of a default admin
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or vice-versa
 struct: I was going to report
 PatrickMcGinnisII: run it off a thumbdrive and it defaults to chinese
 struct: But they want so much stuff
 struct: Like video + statement
 Astrobytes: Hey, feel sorry for the MS guys. Come on, have you not seen the code for windows calc
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: A VIDEO?
 struct: Yes
 struct: and I cant preview it
 struct: so i ditched
 struct: fck that
 Astrobytes: struct:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/">https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/</a>
 struct: which calculator do you use on windows?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eww graphing, i can break it
 struct: I use speedcrunch mostly
 Astrobytes: It's like that EE Java FizzBuzz repo, but real. The GUI stuff... Oh god
 Astrobytes: Oh speedcrunch looks nice, I usually use an offline calc
 Astrobytes: Honestly. WHY is it sooooo very hard, just to give C++ devs a decent way to do native GUI on windoze
 struct: no idea
 Astrobytes: EVEN THEY DON'T KNOW
 KalamariKing: lmao the windows devs hate windows
 Astrobytes: That calc repo is horrifying
 Astrobytes: I'm no evangelist for any OS or way of working but ffs windows
 Astrobytes: I know there are plenty usable gui libs available but ffs, can't I just do it natively? :angry:
 Astrobytes: Anyway. I am tired.
 struct: its like having to set up docker to play cg
 struct: oh wait
 Astrobytes: Worse.
 Astrobytes: Alright, gn all, cya tomorrow
 struct: gn
 KiwiTae: gn
 KalamariKing: Chat went to sleep with Astro, huh
 BigFatDecker:     with open("F:/Nebula0.0.5/chatdata/reddit_data/{}/RC_{}".format(timeframe.split('-')[0], timeframe, buffering=1000) as f:
 BigFatDecker: whats wrong with this
 BigFatDecker: actually ill use pastebin one sec
 Enknable: looks like u want an fstring
 Enknable: buuut
 Enknable: u got no f
 Enknable: ah nm lol
 Enknable: is buffering=1000 supposed to be in format()
 BigFatDecker: ok so would the syntax eyes it is
 Enknable: with open("F:/Nebula0.0.5/chatdata/reddit_data/{}/RC_{}".format(timeframe.split('-')[0], timeframe--&gt;)&lt;--, buffering=1000) as f:
 BigFatDecker: also could it be caused by not having the file fully downloaded? i didnt think it would give a syntax error
 Enknable: nah that would throw some permission error
 Enknable: on runtime
 BigFatDecker: yea thats what i thought 
 BigFatDecker: i still get syntax error even with what you said
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/XXwmSFrB">https://pastebin.com/XXwmSFrB</a> here is the full code
 Enknable: on that line? 
 Enknable: 37.
 Enknable: with open("F:/Nebula0.0.5/chatdata/reddit_data/{}/RC_{}".format(timeframe.split('-')[0]), timeframe, buffering=1000) as f:
 Enknable: thats compiles for me
 Enknable: hopefully you didnt put in the --&gt;&lt;--
 Enknable:&#160;:(
 BigFatDecker: oop had a random indent in there 
 BigFatDecker: IndexError: tuple index out of range is this the error that happens when the file isnt loaded
 Enknable: parent_id = row{'parent_id']
 Enknable: umm
 Enknable: does it hit print(Row)&#160;?
 BigFatDecker: yep i saw that error too it need to be [
 Enknable: yeah thatd be syntax too anyways
 BigFatDecker: it compiles all but this error 
 Enknable: gotta include the error log
 BigFatDecker: im thinking its because the folder is there just not the actual file at least thats what i found from looking the error up 
 Enknable: yeah depending on which module throws th error
 BigFatDecker: alright cool haha now i just gotta wait for the 200 gb files to download haha
 Enknable: depending on how far in 
 Enknable: i think you can chunk it
 Enknable: then process it after it dl's
 Enknable: :thinking:
 BigFatDecker: yea haha itll be awhile tho im barely 6GB in i had to download it as torrent and its going extremely slow
 Databro: Does anybody know what this chat is? I'm new and I just clicked on something, now I can't leave
 Databro: How do I leave? Is this chat just gonna stay on my account the entire time?
 struct: you can click on the triangle thing and it will minimize it
 BigFatDecker: theres a little arrow bottom left
 struct: or you can add ?disableChat to the end of the url
 Databro: I see it now, thank you. How did I get added to this chat?
 ZarthaxX: hacks
 ZarthaxX: Databro you unlock it on lvl 3
 ZarthaxX: it appears automatically once you hit lvl 3
 Databro: Oh I see. I'm sorry y'all. I'm new and I'm just lost in the sauce with everything
 ZarthaxX: its ok&#160;:)
 BigFatDecker: im getting another syntax error on this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Npf17sYN">https://pastebin.com/Npf17sYN</a> line 6
 struct: BigFatDecker isnt it ==&#160;?
 BigFatDecker: i thought that set it as the string i just want to check if it equals deleted
 struct: to check if its equal you need to use == I think
 struct: = is to assign 
 BigFatDecker: i dont know IDLE keeps throwing syntax errors that nothing else is catching
 nugghead: heu 
 nugghead: hey 
 struct: def acceptable(data): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a688f2b-9f36-401c-991d-ee4096766252">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a688f2b-9f36-401c-991d-ee4096766252</a>

 BigFatDecker: hmm do you know of any reason IDLE isnt working it keeps giving me syntax errors
 struct: Does it now show what the error is?
 BigFatDecker: here is the code its showing an error on def sql_insert_replace_comment on the except block

 mustardpudding: oh whoa i was not expecting it to format like that
 BigFatDecker: oops i feel dumb not sure how that happened lol
 BigFatDecker: maybe ive been staring at this code too long haha
 nugghead: i have an interview tmrw with thales&#160;:( 
 nugghead: wish me luck 
 KamalOS: nugghead, Bonne chance!
 nugghead: haha l3ez bro 
 nugghead: @kamalOs Mr&#160;?

 hex.master8: good luch
 hex.master8: luck
 KamalOS: @nuggheadDon't be afraid or worry, "we already naked" - jobs
 nugghead: No, dw, I'll probably pass a technical test, haha that why im practicing codin game right now  
 nugghead: but whatever 
 BigFatDecker: ok so am i getting a pasing error on this code because the file doesnt actually exist yet or is there something else wrong with this code

 davilla: pretty sure that's gonna fail
 MadKnight: yea it runs in a sandbox
 Huntz: @BigFatDecker last line is missing a )
 davilla: woah really? I did not know
 KamalOS: How can I get a problem, I passed it in Clash of Code?
 davilla: I've heard you can't get back into it
 KamalOS: @davilla ok tnx
 KamalOS: is there any chance to repass an old clash problem?
 ZarthaxX: i think you cant
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 BigFatDecker: ok so for time frame i want to put a list of multiple files how could i do that with this code
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/wBXEfLXC">https://pastebin.com/wBXEfLXC</a>
 BigFatDecker: i want to make the database with more then one dataset
 BigFatDecker: but i need them to run one after the other automatically
 ZarthaxX: what are you talking about lol
 BigFatDecker: im trying to make a database with the above code and instead of making multiple i want to put all datasets into one database file instead of multiple
 BigFatDecker: i just need to know how to list all the differant files

 DJ-ALOK: WHY I HAVE TO REFRESH THE PAGE FOR PLAY THE CLASH
 Miki09: I'm in public clash and it's working.
 Miki09: I'm taking back.  You have to reload the page to see the changes.
 Papyrus_HB: can someone help me with the thor challenge, i can not find the flaw logic in my codes at all. I dont know what I missed
 Miki09: episode 1 or episode 2?
 Papyrus_HB: 1
 Miki09: Musíš jen najít směr od jednoho bodu k druhému.
 Papyrus_HB: I wrote the code. but somehow it did not work as intended
 Miki09: You just have to find the direction from one point to another.
 Papyrus_HB: I did
 Papyrus_HB: 'but my code did not work as expected
 Miki09: And the trick is you must update points by jourself
 Miki09: *yourself
 Papyrus_HB: it passed the first two test cases
 Papyrus_HB: is there anyway i can send the code to u
 Miki09: Idk
 Papyrus_HB: can u check message i sent to u
 Miki09: Can u pls send it again?
 Papyrus_HB: ín private message
 Miki09: Give me a moment please
 Papyrus_HB: Okay
 jacek: happy Caturday

 DJ-ALOK: BORING CATURDAY
 DJ-ALOK: jacek
 Korw1n: hey folks! trying to solve "Don't panic - Episode 2" right now and can't pass the last 3 cases, it always fails with a timeout. Does anyone know if it's even possible to solve this task with depth-first search? should I keep trying refactoring that code? or should I try do it with breadth-first search instead?
 DJ-ALOK: sorry i don't solve it 
 DJ-ALOK: so i can't help
 Papyrus_HB: Can you guys play clash?
 jacek: there seems to be problems today
 Papyrus_HB: I cant seem to start any clash
 jacek: probably yet another friday deploy to production ~
 Papyrus_HB: oh need to refresh the tab
 davilla: Don't Panic doesn't require any complex search
 davilla: depth- or breadth-first
 jacek: ep 2?
 davilla: Yes, the elevators always go up.
 davilla: Hold on, no episode 1.
 davilla: Sorry, scratch that.
 Korw1n: yeah, episode one is simple, but I was talking about episode 2&#160;:) 
 davilla: Now you've got me curious.
 davilla: OK but the elevators still always go up, so why can't you just use any available elevator? Sorry thinking out loud here.
 Korw1n: because in episode 2 sometimes there are no elevators on the floor and you need to build one to get up
 Korw1n: and usually there is no enough turns to complete the task, so you need to find the best place where to build that elevator to be able to complete the round
 davilla: So the first twist is pretty straightforward, just build an elevator immediately if you need one.
 davilla: Why wouldn't you want to go up immediately?
 Korw1n: because you do not have unlimitend number of elevators you can build
 Korw1n: you have a fixed number
 davilla: OK interesting, I'm going to try the naive approach right quick just to get kicked in the butt.
 Korw1n: good luck!&#160;:) 
 Uljahn: i guess you have to use existing elevators in the right order with your elevators built in-between to make the shortest path
 davilla: ah OK I get it
 davilla: if there's no elevator, building one immediately is always optimal
 davilla: it's not a question of using them in the right order then
 Korw1n: so have you passed the last 3 test cases?
 davilla: 5 cases
 davilla: but not the last ones
 davilla: not most actually
 Korw1n: yeah, the order doesn't matter for the first 7
 Korw1n: you can build an elevator first or go left/right - you will not get a timeout
 Korw1n: but for the last 3 it's somehow different
 davilla: so the difficulty comes when you don't have enough clones to complete, but you do have extra elevators?
 Korw1n: not sure, since I get a timeout, which means it takes too much time to find the right path
 davilla: ah OK
 davilla: damn now I have to finish this
 Korw1n: the eights test case has 12 floors and 35 columns and a lot of elevators (sometimes more than one on a floor)
 davilla: what does this have to do with HHGG anyway?&#160;:-P
 davilla: getting to the next level up is easy, just trip and forget to fall
 jacek: jrke is i can only DEGRADE soldiers in ATTACK range?
 jacek: jrke also, can i ATTACK soldier in y+2 if there is someone blocking in y+1?
 jrke: jacek there is DEGRADE bug created by my mistake yesterday in animation update i am just fixing it
 jacek: but, can i DEGRADE anywhere, or only withing ATTACK range?
 jacek: the statement doesn't say anything about it
 jrke: anywhere 
 jrke: i am just fixing it
 jacek: ah
 jacek: second question, can soldier in x+2 be attacked if there's someone in x+1
 jrke: yes
 jrke: no blocking is there
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i mean the amount of turns
 BlaiseEbuth: AutomatonNN
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000 you're supposed to restart your brother.
 Automaton2000: there's a lot of calculations
 Illedan: Chat :tada: 
 jacek: meow
 aCat: meow ^^'
 BlaiseEbuth: Nya!
 AntiSquid: now we can discuss clashes
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 geppoz: hi was the chat down all day or it was just my problem?
 jrke: yes the chat was down
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: hey guys
 MSmits: I finished my elm implementation. Oware abapa in a FP language
 MSmits: anyone want to try?
 MSmits: this was for my FP class
 BlaiseEbuth: elm? fp?
 MSmits: functional programming
 MSmits: elm is a language
 MSmits: try here if you want: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ellie-app.com/cNJY3ZVgCSXa1">https://ellie-app.com/cNJY3ZVgCSXa1</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: oh.
 MSmits: I used a negamax for the AI
 MSmits: goes up to depth 6, but it beats me at depth 0 :P
 MSmits: either  i suck or the eval function is just good
 MSmits: maybe both
 AntiSquid: i get some terms of service bs 
 AntiSquid: no way to adblock that entire crap @_@
 MSmits: oh
 BlaiseEbuth: It's amazon, don't worry, you can click eyes closed.
 MSmits: weird, maybe i accepted it a long time ago
 AntiSquid: then i am more worried BlaiseEbuth
 AntiSquid: amazon / facebook and those types of shady businesses
 MSmits: it's just an elm IDE instance with a compiled html app
 AntiSquid: why elm? smaller size&#160;? 
 MSmits: this is the product of a FP class
 MSmits: I will be graded for this
 MSmits: we had to write an app in elm
 MSmits: elm is easy because it compiles to JS
 AntiSquid: i know the benefits
 MSmits: so you can make web apps fast
 AntiSquid: but i didn't know why you use it
 MSmits: i guess thats useful for a class
 MSmits: I think i could write a program in haskell now too, it's very similar
 AntiSquid: do you teach web dev courses now too&#160;?
 MSmits: no you still misunderstand&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am the student here
 AntiSquid: so you learn web dev&#160;?
 MSmits: I am doing this to get my CS teaching degree
 MSmits: it's just one of 4 classes like this
 MSmits: i also did an AI class, internet securty and game design
 AntiSquid: how long are you studying in total for cs teaching degree&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: I really don't see what you mean... These little "human sized" business are totally worth of confiance...
 jacek: oware in elm? :scream:
 MSmits: i could waive part of it, so only a little over a year
 MSmits: almost done
 MSmits: will be done before summer
 MSmits: jacek yeah, they suggested tic tac toe, but meh
 MSmits: too obvious
 MSmits: also it was supposed to be a 2p game
 BlaiseEbuth: counter strike teaching degree&#160;?
 MSmits: but it's a point of pride for me to write AI instead
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth lol
 jacek: and eval is from that site?
 MSmits: yeah that site we all used when first writing oware bot
 MSmits: it's not particularly strong for a bot, but compared to a clueless human it's fine
 BlaiseEbuth: Do it in clojure now.
 MSmits: no thanks&#160;:) I did get an appreciation for FP languages but I  still prefer imperative
 MSmits: the elm coding style is horrible btw, you can click a button to auto style my code in ellie
 MSmits: it doubles the number of lines
 MSmits: so i just used my own coding style
 MSmits: it's amazing how you can code an entire program without using variables and loops
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: so just constants, functions and recursion
 jacek: :tada:
 AntiSquid: "jacek yeah, they suggested tic tac toe, but meh" - should have done oware abapa with tic tacs instead of numbers
 jacek: ultimate oware?

 Zenoscave: hi all. PEWPEW
 BlaiseEbuth: pewpew&#160;!
 Zenoscave: long time!
 Zenoscave: How goes it in these parts?
 AntiSquid: it's like the wild west, but without any cowboys
 Zenoscave: I've been stocking up on PTO for the contest
 AntiSquid: i have time off too, but have lots of other more urgent things to take care of T_T
 AntiSquid: will see how much overlaps
 Zenoscave: Have we learned anything about it? Multi? Single-player?
 BlaiseEbuth: Rototo
 AntiSquid: it's inspired from Made in Abyss if you check cover art you'll see
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a> zeno
 Zenoscave: I definitely see BlaiseEbuth 's version
 jacek: its obviously MLP
 BlaiseEbuth: Marine LePen&#160;?
 Zenoscave: jacek, I feel like you would/do run ponyOS
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 initiate votekick for MLP suggestion @_@
 Automaton2000: anyway got to go now
 KiwiTae: Zenoscave pewpew
 jacek: for new episode?
 KiwiTae: o/
 KiwiTae: hi guys
 BlaiseEbuth: \o
 AntiSquid: KiwiTae what does look like to you&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 AntiSquid: made in abyss anime/manga right? 
 AntiSquid: this *
 Zenoscave: Anti, I didn't say jacek should... just seems up the right alley...
 Zenoscave: KiwiTae pewpew
 KiwiTae: princess mononoke
 KiwiTae: dunno makes me think of the gremlins too
 MSmits: wait isn't that the anime figure jacek reads papers about?
 Zenoscave: Did you mean:Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo
 MSmits: I think i'll be able to join this next contest with some seriousness. Been a while
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 MSmits: most of my study stuff will be done
 jacek: MSmits shes called Quetzalcoatl
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: youd knew if you paid for the paper
 MSmits: sure
 BlaiseEbuth: Who pay for paper
 MSmits: oh noes, not again
 AntiSquid: it does look liek totorobut it must be the episode when the descend into the hole and reach level 6 of the abyss&#160;!!!
 MSmits: one time, it was one time
 Zenoscave: MSmits are you gunning for top 3?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: maybe if there were 1k participants
 MSmits: but these days it's 5k
 MSmits: will be happy with t-shirt
 Zenoscave: I'm still holding the t-shirt goal
 Zenoscave: Might need to practice more these next few weeks
 MSmits: i actually havent won a t-shirt in almost 2 yeara i think
 Zenoscave: get my C# chops back
 BlaiseEbuth: That's why I directly buy my T-shirts???
 MSmits: think last one was code a la mode?
 Zenoscave: I never have T.T
 Zenoscave: Closest was 
 Zenoscave: Ocean and the last one
 AntiSquid: lucky to have 1 i guess
 MSmits: ahh no, my last one was ice and fire
 MSmits: got 17th there in my weekend sprint
 AntiSquid: it was 7k last time and during pacman there were also some very strong contestants compared to other times MSmits
 Zenoscave: nice MSmits
 MSmits: Zenoscave whats the main obstacle to getting top 20?
 MSmits: time or ideas?
 Zenoscave: ideas
 BlaiseEbuth: Being naked.
 MSmits: lol
 Zenoscave: I always plateau in top Gold
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: with me it's mostly time/energy even when I invest 80 hrs or so
 BlaiseEbuth: Come in France, the plateau can go up...
 MSmits: i keep getting new ideas
 Zenoscave: Maybe send any extra ideas you don't have energy for to me???
 MSmits: this is also why i get hooked to multis for months
 MSmits: well i usually do that with multis
 Zenoscave: Just figured I'd try that shot...
 MSmits: and i would not mind sharing some in contests but i dont even chat due to lack of time
 Zenoscave: maybe i'll do GAImax
 MSmits: usually i chat a little bit 6 days in or so
 Zenoscave: I have to plan work deployments around the contest this time. Let's hope I don't have any production pushes that week
 BlaiseEbuth: Sell your extra ideas MSmits, you can buy a lot of t-shirts.
 MSmits: sounds like labor
 AntiSquid: sabotage the proj so it gets delayed Zenoscave
 MSmits: i dont even wear t-shirts much
 MSmits: and my wife hates the CG ones
 Zenoscave: Anti... ssshhh
 BlaiseEbuth: :flushed:
 AntiSquid: did you wear the shirts in front of her MSmits&#160;?
 KiwiTae: quit your job before the contest
 Zenoscave: I need the income to live sadly. It's expensive near me
 AntiSquid: say you tested positive for covid 
 Zenoscave: I work 100% remote. So I don't think that'd do much Anti :D
 KiwiTae: get a sugar mamma
 Zenoscave: I think KiwiTae has the right idea
 AntiSquid: ugh
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 Zenoscave: Seeing how my rent is ~1200 GBP/ mo. she better be a really good sugar availability
 AntiSquid: i have the feeling it will be something similar to agar.io so in a way probably somewhat like PCR&#160;?
 Zenoscave: It's just a bot agar.io clone 
 Zenoscave: with fog of war
 Zenoscave: WAIT NOT PHYSICS BASED I SUCK AT THOSE
 MSmits: I think they are annoying, but why would you suck at those
 MSmits: once you coded the sim, it's like other games
 MSmits: it's the sim that's annoying
 Zenoscave: I have yet to finish the sim...
 AntiSquid: i have mildly improved after doing a bit of search race
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Zenoscave: for any of them
 MSmits: but thats not an idea problem
 MSmits: it's just coding speed
 MSmits: it's not fun but it's not hard either
 Zenoscave: I get the +/- on the vector to UI coords messed up every time
 MSmits: well me too
 MSmits: but try it both ways, one will stick
 AntiSquid: you have to copy the referee for those and then translate or use the sims you have for other phys games @_@
 MSmits: thats what i do
 Zenoscave: Do they use the same engine each time?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: not really
 MSmits: they have different versions with small changes
 AntiSquid: i mean mean max is different from the rest
 MSmits: collision engine changed at some point
 MSmits: it's simpler now
 Zenoscave: What game would be the most up to date engine?
 MSmits: csb, pcr and FB are the same i think?
 Zenoscave: Speed or br2048 perhaps?
 MSmits: br2048 is not by the cg devs
 Zenoscave: Ah right.
 MSmits: csb is probably still the newest?
 MSmits: or did meanmax come later?
 Zenoscave: mean max came later I believe
 MSmits: ah ok
 KiwiTae: yes meanmax was my first contest
 MSmits: i have no actually done any physics contest
 KiwiTae: csb waqs already a thing
 AntiSquid: but we had search race and br2048 so i imagine they took some inspiration from there IF it is a physics game
 MSmits: they are fairly close to csb though, just more friendly to codes
 MSmits: coders
 KiwiTae: it always takes me 4days to read wood rules
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 AntiSquid: could be grid based too, but not sure what the game would be like then, i mean there's a lot of grid games
 Zenoscave: At least  you read em. *cough cough* ceg.
 Zenoscave: I have pretty good handle on grid games
 MSmits: I always have 1 horrible misread that caused me to have to recode like 200 lines
 MSmits: usually a line with a dubious meaning of which i pick the most unlikely interpretation
 Zenoscave: I usually forget to read past wood and end up in gold with a bot compatible with wood
 darkhorse64: MSmits: not tempted to try smitsimax on the sofia labs challenge&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or since there are tree in the background maybe you'll need some heavy use of trees  - bfs like in fall2020&#160;?
 Zenoscave: sofia labs darkhorse64?
 MSmits: darkhorse64 when is that? I wont have time in the near future, maybe in 2 weeks or so
 AntiSquid: OMG&#160;!! what if it's auto-chess&#160;!? with fury beasts&#160;?
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge</a>
 MSmits: fury or furry?
 AntiSquid: 3 merge into a 2 star puff balls and 3*2 stars merge into a 3 star&#160;! :o
 MSmits: as to that, does beasts also lack an r?
 AntiSquid: maybe just the later
 MSmits: ahh contest already started
 MSmits: no time unfortunately
 Zenoscave: And you can't register from USA
 darkhorse64: it's a semi private contest organized rn.
 Zenoscave: Ah gotcha
 darkhorse64: csb like: one pod, several boosts, instant rotation
 AntiSquid: long week ahead
 AntiSquid: i'll save my energy#
 MSmits: ow yeah, i am guessing pb 4 already has a NN
 AntiSquid: csb NN&#160;? i don't think even transfer learning could help much ... gotta retrain from ground up and if it's 1 week&#160;? no time
 MSmits: from what i know of nns on cg, some of them train overnight
 MSmits: i mainly meant the framework
 AntiSquid: oh that's a hypersonic version, didn't look
 darkhorse64: It has not been heavily promoted. Just in case some people here are interested
 AntiSquid: wrong again it's some csb version ... why the funny picture&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=52762724916027">https://www.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=52762724916027</a>
 MSmits: it's just a standard picture to explain the CG botting system
 ErrorRazor: So the contest is not an april fools prank?
 AntiSquid: this looks like search race multiplayer
 MSmits: yeah it does
 darkhorse64: not it's not. With collisions
 MSmits: well in search race you also collide with all opponents
 MSmits: there just aren't any
 AntiSquid: ya that's some good manoeuvring on pb pod 
 jacek:  
 lukkaku12: Can someone help me with Dungeons and Maps? in JavaScript
 Kellthazar: Ugh... this last test case of nuggets numbers.
 Pepis: how to debug in here..&#160;?
 Ordonnateur: depend on the language (try the error message of yours)
 struct: hi
 jacek: oO
 Pepis: can i view clash, after its finished?
 jacek: only the result, in notifications
 Pepis: thanks
 Wontonimo: finally got an adequate bot for SC2020 submitted
 Wontonimo: yeah me
 jacek: protoss?
 Wontonimo: haha , no the CG pacman game
 davilla: hi folks, question about contributions:how do you add an image to a description?
 davilla: I guess I could turn a classic puzzle into a solo puzzle, but that seems like overkill

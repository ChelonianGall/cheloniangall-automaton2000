 Smelty: o.O
 ZarthaxX: hi Smelty&#160;:*
 eulerscheZahl: when I heard about the y2k problem, i was just worried that my favorite computer games would still run
 eulerscheZahl: i was 8 at that time
 ZarthaxX: first world problem haha
 pmor: I was offered a lot of money when I was in college to fix y2k code.  Turned it down cause I had no interest in working in COBOL
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: why i recieve no achievement or exp for completing puzzles?
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: :sweat:
 klmn: Me2, no exp, no achiev
 Smelty: you have  to wait i think its broken atm
 eulerscheZahl: it always takes a few days
 eulerscheZahl: first they will run their plagiarism check to remove those players who cheated
 eulerscheZahl: then shift the game to the multiplayer section and do the achievements
 Smelty: ah
 eulerscheZahl: this blocks other achievements as well. they are in the queue, but after the contest ones
 eulerscheZahl: oh, they already gave contest points
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: ic, but it did not take this long previously
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: is it because the hard puzzles or the spring contest?
 eulerscheZahl: the contest
 eulerscheZahl: after a contests there's always a slowdown
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: oh, ic. Thanks

 MSmits: my uncle worked for IBM in 1999 and was detached to Japan to help them with the millenium problem
 MSmits: I remember he had to use a keyboard overlay thingy because otherwise he couldnt use their keyboards
 MSmits: really was a serious scare
 Tiramon: why didn't he bring his own?
 Tiramon: at least i would bring a qwertz keyboard from home&#160;:)
 jrke: they didn't released multi for SC21 yet?
 Tiramon: guess they will release it til end of the week, last times they were quite fast
 Tiramon: early on it took a feew weeks, last contests were out in a few days up to a week
 ThunderbirdOne: so, trying to get into c++ here on CG... is there some utility function somewhere that splits strings by a delimiter&#160;?
 jrke: yeah last time it released under 5-6 hours
 Marchete: i got my string split from stackoverflow
 Marchete: it's not like C#
 ThunderbirdOne: I know, i'm kind of bothered with it :P
 Marchete: why C++ btw?
 Marchete: C# is competent enough
 ThunderbirdOne: oh just some badges/achievements on here lol
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: ok
 ThunderbirdOne: needed 1 more puzzle to level up my c++ lol
 ThunderbirdOne: but it still baffles me that functions to work with strings aren't there...
 ThunderbirdOne: i mean, i guess you could do it using substring over and over, but... meh :P
 Tiramon: google says <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/04/21/how-to-split-a-string-in-c/">https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/04/21/how-to-split-a-string-in-c/</a>
 cegprakash: I don't know what's wrong with my power of thro
 cegprakash: Power of THor
 cegprakash: I move in diagonal first
 cegprakash: but I run out off energy
 ThunderbirdOne: which power of thor?
 cegprakash: code golf
 ThunderbirdOne: ah
 cegprakash: okay found the bug
 cegprakash: my bad
 cegprakash: I wandered off the board

 KiwiTae:  cegprakash 700+ char? you can do better hehe
 cegprakash: 384
 derjack: in python?
 cegprakash:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: KiwiTae
 cegprakash: i can still reduce&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I see ppl have done with 88 chars
 cegprakash: with c
 cegprakash: :o 
 cegprakash: 336
 jrke: my power of thor python is 116
 Tiramon: got power of thor at 79 .. not sure in which lang&#160;;)
 Tiramon: at pyhton i'm at 114
 Tiramon: oh js was the 79
 cegprakash: anyone know c equivalent of cerr
 Tiramon: it should be mentioned in the default code
 Tiramon: To debug: fprintf(stderr, "Debug messages...\n");
 jrke: default stub generated code has that thing cegprakash
 Jo4: @ThePoisoned1 i just bruteforced the whole thing
 ThePoisoned1:&#160;:/
 Jo4: it is a logical solution to it
 Jo4: but i didnt want to think, so a bf solution by testing all combinations works as well
 ThePoisoned1: but thats kinda sus
 Jo4: why?
 ThePoisoned1: i mean the problem tells u not to sort because is inneficient
 ThePoisoned1: bf shoul not be much better
 Jo4: im not sorting
 Jo4: you have to optimize it
 Jo4: somewaht
 Jo4: like not calculating combinations thats bigger than the current minimum
 ThePoisoned1: i guess
 ThePoisoned1: my idea was to have a list of containers and try to see if i can put the container at the begining or the end of it
 ThePoisoned1: the cargo*
 ThePoisoned1: if i cant place it in any
 Uljahn: use stacks
 ThePoisoned1: so 
 ThePoisoned1: u have your stack
 davilla: funny you mention, my solution used sets&#160;:-P
 ThePoisoned1: LIFO
 ThePoisoned1: right?
 ThePoisoned1: then u try to put the coming cargo somewhere and if u cant u stack it?
 ThePoisoned1: i never worked with stack so idk who to use them
 ThePoisoned1:&#160;:(
 Uljahn: actually you can use lists just don't put elements at the beginning
 ThePoisoned1: like
 ThePoisoned1: only in one direction
 ThePoisoned1: liek either the list is getting lower containers
 ThePoisoned1: or hihger
 ThePoisoned1: but not mix them?
 ThePoisoned1: if i only check if the container is hihgeror equal to the last one(Ascii val)
 ThePoisoned1: and if i cant put it an a new one
 ThePoisoned1: the example gives me
 ThePoisoned1: 1 3 3 3 4
 ThePoisoned1: and its supposed to give 
 ThePoisoned1: 1 3 1 4 4
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, if someone can help me why I am not getting any output
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b339b144-d6a2-4a2e-a9eb-4b68efe0bc39">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b339b144-d6a2-4a2e-a9eb-4b68efe0bc39</a>
 Uljahn: ThePoisoned1: what if there are some stacks with hegher elements already?
 davilla: You're getting 3 instead of 1 because you're being inefficient, and you're getting 3 instead of 4 because you stacked them in the wrong order.
 Uljahn: *higher
 davilla: I would concentrate on the latter problem first. Don't put Z on top of A, or that ship won't sail.
 ThePoisoned1: like save all of the containers
 ThePoisoned1: and then u check if u can put any of the remaing oens in oen spot?
 ThePoisoned1: ik why the 3 instead of 1 is wrong
 davilla: It's not actually necessary to save all the containers in order to solve, but it might make it easier to think about and debug.
 ThePoisoned1: but why is: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/67ab8952-ba50-47ca-aa60-9ed6de5b84b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/67ab8952-ba50-47ca-aa60-9ed6de5b84b1</a>
 Uljahn: i guess you should find the minimum stack with greater or equal last cargo, and if there are none then make a new stack
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.diffchecker.com/BgIjEIxb">https://www.diffchecker.com/BgIjEIxb</a> code cleanup has worsened the no. of characters lol
 ThePoisoned1: mmmmmmm
 Uljahn: i mean minimum ascii of the last element
 ThePoisoned1: yeah
 ThePoisoned1: but ist that like sorting
 ThePoisoned1:&#160;?
 ThePoisoned1: like adding the cargoes but sorted
 ThePoisoned1: i guess not realyl
 davilla: You got that for input BDNIDPD
 ThePoisoned1: yeah
 davilla: so the first thing your code did was put D on top of B?
 ThePoisoned1: yeah i guess
 davilla: How are you going to load ship B, if there's a D sitting on top of it?
 ThePoisoned1: liek u have 
 ThePoisoned1: B D N P
 ThePoisoned1: u take b then d then n then p
 ThePoisoned1: wait
 davilla: Think of physical containers sitting on a dock. P is on top of everything. You're not getting to B.
 ThePoisoned1: the cargo only has 1 door?
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 davilla: Think vertically.
 ThePoisoned1: thats what i was missing
 Marchete: that was fast
 ThePoisoned1: yeah
 ThePoisoned1: i thoug i coul just put the cargo from one side ant take it from teh otehr
 ThePoisoned1: i was thinking it as FIFO
 ThePoisoned1: and its not
 ThePoisoned1: kekw
 davilla: Heh, good.
 Krakenus00: wuta?Is it the challenge of the week?
 ThePoisoned1: yeah
 Krakenus00: Oh, it's rather simple
 Krakenus00: Check the tests and why do they stack containers in such manner
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea6b5def-3a35-4be1-b02e-1b4e7e60a650">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea6b5def-3a35-4be1-b02e-1b4e7e60a650</a>
 cegprakash: need a shorter code than that :P
 Krakenus00: omg what is that
 derjack: remove new lines?
 cegprakash: I mean after removing new lines
 cegprakash: Krakenus00 using it for power of thor code golf lol
 ThePoisoned1: got it
 ThePoisoned1: was just an idiot myself
 Tiramon: how many chars in what lang is that cegprakash?
 cegprakash: I use c Tiramon
 cegprakash: U;n at 281 chars currently
 Tiramon: that's not one of the default golfs .. is it?
 KiwiTae: cegprakash yeah you can x&lt;a?&#160;: instead of x&lt;a&amp;&#160;?:
 KiwiTae: Tiramon its his thor code prob
 Tiramon: that is thor? how with out NSWE chars ...
 cegprakash: don't get you KiwiTae
 KiwiTae: he gets an index
 KiwiTae: then read a table of str maybe
 Tiramon: my c solution of thor is 152 chars long
 cegprakash: I use this Tiramon char *m[8]={"SE","NE","SW","NW","E","S","W","N"};int u[]={1,1,-1,-1,1,0,-1,0};int v[]={1,-1,1,-1,0,1,0,-1};
 Krakenus00: in C I have 124 chars
 ThePoisoned1: you can check first if it need to go N or S
 ThePoisoned1: then u can add E or W
 ThePoisoned1: afterwards
 Tiramon: you never go N anyway ...
 cegprakash: never north?
 cegprakash: u mean test cases are weak? :P
 Tiramon: kind of
 ThePoisoned1: u do in the problem itself
 ThePoisoned1: not in the tests
 ThePoisoned1: the actual test has north
 Tiramon: in which case?
 KiwiTae: d=x&lt;a?y&lt;b?0:y&gt;b?1:4
 Marchete: you go North now
 Marchete: recheck it
 cegprakash: yes there is north just checked
 ThePoisoned1: in the validators
 ThePoisoned1: test 2 and 4 need u to go north too
 Tiramon: oh did they fix the validators?
 Marchete: it was changed, yes
 Tiramon: oh right
 KiwiTae: y if your solution dont pass 100%now u have 0pts
 Tiramon: ok then none of my thor solutions will work anymore =)
 KiwiTae: you must have lost the points :p
 cegprakash: for(scanf("%d%d%d%d",&amp;a,&amp;b,&amp;x,&amp;y);scanf("%d",&amp;t);x+=u[d],y+=v[d],puts(m[d])){
 Marchete: system("magichere");
 KiwiTae: personaly i dont parse the string
 Tiramon: KiwiTae my solutions are still valid, also if i would resubmit they won't work with those validators
 Krakenus00: you don't need to scanf turns btw
 Krakenus00: just remove it
 Tiramon: intial scanf is enough right
 cegprakash: no u need to read every turn
 Krakenus00: nope
 KiwiTae: no you dont
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: I see this is not a multi
 Tiramon: turn info in thor is pretty useless
 KiwiTae: even if its a multi you got enough info
 cegprakash: in multi if u don't read all the inputs the game will be messed up next turn
 KiwiTae: no
 KiwiTae: you just get somewhat blind
 Tiramon: really stupid that there is no N testcase ...
 KiwiTae: there are now no?
 Krakenus00: does the code above work?
 Tiramon: my northless code can still solve all testcases
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt;
 Tiramon: but only gets 50% on validators
 cegprakash: 249 now.&#160;:)
 cegprakash: enough for today&#160;:)
 Tiramon: hm those new validators make the task more complex ...
 Krakenus00: Can't get any less than 123. I wonder how pardouin managed to solve it with only 47 chars
 Krakenus00: There should be a much better algorithm
 Tiramon: damn northonly was so much shorter&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: I have 108 exploiting southless validators. I think Pardouin et al. are using "system" tricks
 Tiramon: damn those validators are even more stupid than i thought
 darkhorse64: Yeah, there should be more of them
 ArtLiteracyStory: this is so fun
 Krakenus00: I don't even know which system commands I can use here:sweat_smile:
 ArtLiteracyStory: This place is awesome
 Krakenus00: Yeah, it is
 ArtLiteracyStory: first time here
 Krakenus00: I love this place much more than leetcode or hackerrank
 ArtLiteracyStory: never tried those other sites. I like how realtime this is
 Krakenus00: I also like this rating and achievements system
 ArtLiteracyStory: I feel like my code shouldn't work but I won anyway in this last game lol
 [CG]Thibaud: :heart:
 mikmak: darkhorse64, I didn't read all the discussion, but do you mean that you don't need "S" at all (and all variant)&#160;?
 Tiramon: old validators were only SWE movement current validators are only NSE movement
 Tiramon: already told thibaud so he can fix that&#160;;)
 ArtLiteracyStory: I love the gamification of programming being done here
 darkhorse64: However tests go south. Best is to write that works in all cases and then golf from this starting point
 darkhorse64: *write something*
 Westicles: I thought it was programification of gaming
 Tiramon: damn with a all direction solution my thor solution has grown from 79 to 125 :sob:
 Krakenus00: cheater...
 Krakenus00: I have 123 without cheating
 Krakenus00: But what's the point of using system? For storing variables or what?
 mikmak: 115 without cheating in C.
 mikmak: I just gain 2 characters in C++ by removing the W :innocent:
 Westicles: LPT:  Call the guy a cheater after he helps you, not before
 Tiramon: thibaud will add W again ... so your W less solution will get no score
 jacek: oO
 Tiramon: just create a solution with all directions working ... and yes that will increase size and makes approaches more complex
 jacek: validators change periodically?
 mikmak: I will re-add the W then
 Tiramon: no only until they validate what they should validate&#160;:)
 Tiramon: thibaud thought he had all directions in the validators ... i proofed him wrong&#160;:)
 Westicles: It has only been brought up like 5,000 times.  Pretty sure they don't care
 Alihussain: hi
 Tiramon: oh is that new that i start in the mp of the contest with my old code and history and in the league i was last in?
 Tiramon: so no extra promotion xp if i play contest and mp&#160;:(
 jacek: hmm? i promoted to gold and got 250xp
 Tiramon: i only have the xp of the promotions i got in the contest
 Alihussain: hi
 Alihussain: iam new here
 Tiramon: welcome Alihussain&#160;:)
 SabertheLost: omg, the only 1 seed at a time made me from 300 to seem to be promoted to gold?
 Tiramon: yes also tested thatwithout limit 119everything below 5 seed was worseand only 1 seed at a time got me to a score of 126&#160;:)
 jrke: oh so multi released
 Tiramon: yes they copied the contest to multi
 Tiramon: with all code and leaderboards and history
 jrke: happens every time tiramon
 jrke: tags says minimax + graphs
 Tiramon: nowaday yes ... earlier contests not
 jacek: graphs... and everyone doing bitboards
 SabertheLost: wow rank 800  in gold by the seedcost &lt; 1 .
 KelvinAndHubbles: hit gold league during the contest, but my quest map isn't updating even now. Is there something to do for that?
 jacek: what quest
 SabertheLost: time too add any type of look ahead. not just wired possible best move this action
 KelvinAndHubbles: The "Hit gold league quest"
 jacek: reach the gold league in any game?
 jacek: could be you need to wait for next day
 SabertheLost: can you score zero when harvest a tree&#160;? 
 SabertheLost: SabertheLost is ending their tree life on cell 33, scoring 0  
 SabertheLost: I thougth at least 1? (even if that is same/worse then the cost 4)
 Njitram: If nutrients = 0 and the cell richness = 1.
 jrke: if nutrient == 0 and richness == 0 then it can give you 0 score 
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, I guess so, I don't even have CP yet for the game, so I guess it's gone take a second
 jacek: you cant plant on richness 0
 jacek: richness 1 gives 0 points
 jrke: ^
 Tiramon: still 1 score from complete is worth less than 1.33 score from suns
 jrke: my bad
 SabertheLost: Oh, so richenesss 1 is zero? that should been 0 and -1 then...
 Njitram: Read the rules carefully&#160;;)
 Codechaos: Yes, richness 1 = 0 Bonus, richness 2 = 2 Bonus, richness 3 = 4 Bonus
 Marchete: nutrient 0 richness 1 ==1&lt;1.33 not worth it
 SabertheLost: Yeah, so many rules that were counter intivue this time
 Tiramon: nutrient 0 richness 1 == 0
 Marchete: any eval on endgame should use scoreme - scoreenm
 Marchete: no matter other stuff, as sun is converted by 1/3
 Marchete: or 3*score + sun
 Marchete: it's the same
 Wontonimo: what?  We don't have to resubmit into the multi for SC2021?  Cool that our bot is just copied over!
 Marchete: also history
 MSmits: 3* score + sun is not the same as score + sun /3
 Marchete: it seems a move rather than a copy
 Wontonimo: oh, that's awesome
 Marchete: true
 Marchete: division
 MSmits: well thats all i got to say about last contest, trying to forget it now :P
 Marchete: but I saw some others using it
 Wontonimo: yeah, the sun needs to be truncated 
 MSmits: i saw i still got some reasonable cp even though it was low legend result. High playercount helps!
 MSmits: though still less cp than my spring 2020 result
 KalamariKing: wdym cp
 KalamariKing: explain
 jacek: coding points
 jacek: not the other cp
 MSmits: decides competitive rank
 MSmits: its not the most important thing, but it helps with motivation
 MSmits: same as xp
 Marchete: smits
 Wontonimo: i'm pretty happy with my CP drop from this competition
 Wontonimo: *gain
 jacek: oO
 jacek: oh
 Marchete: can I ask you some mathematical equivalence on PUCT?
 Wontonimo: (i was thinking loot drop)
 MSmits: cool sure
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-3-parameter-tweaking-4dceb78ed1e5">https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-3-parameter-tweaking-4dceb78ed1e5</a>
 jacek: math? :scream:
 Marchete: We calculate PUCT(s, a) = Q(s, a) + U(s, a), where U is calculated as follows
 Marchete: I understand it as
 Marchete: PUCT = sumScoreChild/childvisits + k*Prob*sqrt(parent)/(1+childvisits)
 Marchete: PUCT=sumScoreChild*(1+childvisits)+k*Prob*sqrt(parent)*childvisits&#160;?
 MSmits: the first term is correct for sure
 MSmits: let me look at the second
 MSmits: oh that is your question
 MSmits: sec
 Marchete: both
 Marchete: if I understand it right
 Marchete: and if it can be tweaked
 MSmits: do you mean both of these are equivalent?
 Marchete: in terms of selecting max PUCT 
 Marchete: the classic Select() from MCTS
 Tiramon: great i always had a simple calculation error in my shadows affecting cells
 MSmits: Marchete you multiplied both terms with childvisits and childvisits + 1 yes?
 MSmits: to get from 1st version to 2nd version?
 jacek: looks fishy
 Marchete: both  with (child)*(1+child)
 MSmits: yes, i think its wrong
 MSmits: because
 MSmits: you compare different children
 jacek: this way more childvisits means more exploration
 Marchete: so denominators go away
 jacek: or rather, less exploration overeall
 MSmits: yes within that formula they go away
 MSmits: but
 MSmits: you compare many children
 MSmits: and take the best PUCT
 Marchete: ahh true
 MSmits: they are not all multiplied by the same 
 Marchete: ok
 Marchete: yeah, the other part
 Marchete: thnx
 MSmits: did you have another question about this?
 Marchete: a lot!
 Marchete: but the whole NN is full of questions
 MSmits: well i dont know a lot about azero in general, just the basics
 jacek: but NN is to provide answers
 MSmits: my next step is still implementing jacek-NN
 MSmits: in oware
 MSmits: rest comes later
 jrke: i wanna learn NN
 jrke: but unable to
 MSmits: do the xor example jrke
 MSmits: plenty to find
 Wontonimo: ha, CoC Addict achievement (100 clashes) pushed me to Level 29
 MSmits: but if you want to do NN;s in a board game, practice mcts first
 MSmits: nice!
 MSmits: I got lvl 36 from one of the league promotions in contesr
 MSmits: most of my xp is probably from solving puzzles over the summer vacations
 jacek: you can get 2500 XP for "Create a community contest"
 jacek: ah wait...
 MSmits: lol...
 KalamariKing: you should get at least a little bit of xp for coc's
 MSmits: people spam them too much
 KalamariKing: true
 MSmits: also some people have libraries with solutions
 MSmits: they just paste it in, insta win
 darkhorse64: I recently read a book:"Neural Networks from scratch in Python". This book is as low level as you can get. It even goes to explain what is a derivative. The only requirement is python + numpy, no other third party librairies. Honestly, I learned a lot reading this book even though it is not geared towards gaming
 KalamariKing: Wait really?
 MSmits: well you can get repeats after a few 100 clashes
 MSmits: this is not that common
 KalamariKing: Seen a couple of those yeah
 MSmits: but it happens
 MSmits: good advice darkhorse64
 MSmits: jrke wake up
 MSmits: buy book
 jrke: which book
 MSmits: darkhorse64
 KalamariKing: all of them
 MSmits: read
 jacek: darkhorse64 every NN tutorial is about bunch of derivative formulas, which they dont understand, then python import nn; nn.train(mnist). the end :unamused:
 KalamariKing: or just burn through the tensorflow/pytorch manuals
 KalamariKing: that's what I did
 darkhorse64: After that, you'll get a better comprehension of what the xor code does (because there are some shortcuts in the code)
 MSmits: some xor code examples have no bias
 MSmits: and no option for more layers
 MSmits: so yeah, shortcuts
 MSmits: the one jacek shared was pretty good in this regard
 MSmits: at least had bias and i think not too hard to extend with more layers
 darkhorse64: jacek: exactly. Nearly everything I have found throws 50 lines of tensorflow or pytorch when training and you do not get a clue. This book goes not
 darkhorse64: *does*
 jacek: i think i managed to make simple softmax network, it seems to be consistent with what keras outputs, but it looks so simple in comparison to bunch of math mambo-jumbo softmax derivations im not sure if its correct
 MSmits: it's not, I think it's mumbo jumbo
 darkhorse64: the book explains softmax and its derivatives.
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/UdZwFDgd">https://pastebin.com/UdZwFDgd</a> vs <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Pj37A0YG">https://pastebin.com/Pj37A0YG</a>
 darkhorse64: There are youtube tutorials centered on the first chapters of the book. Really amazing. They explains why use bias, what are layers, ...
 MSmits: nice one jacek
 Tiramon: hm fixing my shadows improved me another 500+ ranksdamn why didn't i see this one line on monday morning&#160;:(
 MSmits: this is why i do not return to contests
 MSmits: at least not in a year or so :P
 Tiramon: good point&#160;:)
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: think imight return to kutulu some point
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557938351">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557938351</a> - my bot learns to earn sunpoints 
 jrke: :grin:
 darkhorse64: There are also chapters on various optimizers. Now when I read Keras code, I get some clue
 MSmits: darkhorse, i am getting that read
 Tiramon: jrke if he now also learns to spend them =)
 MSmits: dont mind if i already know 90%, its a fun subject
 MSmits: and will learn some
 MSmits: ttyl, train arriving
 Wontonimo: later
 darkhorse64: I got more than 10% new content even if I skipped the math
 Astrobytes: why skip the math? Or you know it already I guess
 jacek: who needs math
 Astrobytes: Well, I mean, it's pretty handy
 Wontonimo: it took me about 6 months of about  10  hours a week of coding small NN until it really clicked for me.  NN architecture is nothing like any other programming except maybe shader coding
 Tiramon: and NN is still always different&#160;:)
 jrke: is NN used just for evaluating a state?
 Wontonimo: you can use it for just that if you want.  you can use it to eval moves,
 Wontonimo: or both
 jacek: i only use it to evaluate state
 Tiramon: it's complicated ...
 Alihussain: hi bro iam doing coding about 12 months above but my logic is not really good and i am using c++ language what should i do 
 Marchete: and when you try to merge all, it gets harder
 Tiramon: Alihussain keep coding and improve bit by bit
 Alihussain: can any one help me
 Wontonimo: sure
 jacek: try easy puzzles first
 Wontonimo: i'll dm you
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I skipped the math because all of this is quite familiar. The other thing you can look at after reading the book is the binary neural network exercise on CG. This is a good starting point for implementing your own library and win a CG three years after
 darkhorse64: CG contest
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I remember you recommended that puzzle previously
 Tiramon: there is a binary nn stuff at cg?

 Tiramon: yes just found it ... just didn't know 
 darkhorse64: I started last summer with it but I did not understand all of it because it lacks explanation. With the book, it's much more clear (but not easier to implement)
 nam4.nguyen: follow Wontonimo and he will guide u so much 
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: thanks nam4.nguyen
 Tiramon: my basic understandings of NN comes from the udacity deep reinformenent leerding i took last yearwas hard but helpful
 Tiramon: *learning
 jacek: i took part of coursera machine learning course
 nam4.nguyen: especially at first :D
 jacek: by ng andrew
 nam4.nguyen: I know him
 nam4.nguyen: oh ni
 nam4.nguyen: just by his reputation
 nam4.nguyen: I took a course too
 Wontonimo: i did that course about 4 years ago.  Super course!
 KalamariKing: Are clashes not ranked or smth
 Tiramon: KalamariKing CP are only recalced daily
 iggy12345: they have they're own ranking
 KalamariKing: In this lobby, rn, there's someone in 2kth place, I'm in 7kth place, and there are plenty in 20-40kth place
 KalamariKing: This is all over the place
 Tiramon: oh you mean like leagues .. no you will clash with any skill available
 jacek: diversity :heart:
 MSmits: book seems cool darkhorse64
 MSmits: will read, 600+ pages will take a while though
 jacek: beware of spoilers
 jacek: its not a happy ending
 darkhorse64: Actually, it took me two days because I could do some quick reading on obvious parts
 MSmits: did you remember to eat, breathe and sleep in those two days?
 Astrobytes: lol
 BrickWill68: yepp
 Astrobytes: I feel you'll be able to skip some parts too MSmits
 darkhorse64: barely
 MSmits: probably, i might not anyway. Sometimes you recognize something, but reinforcement of knowledge is also good. Stops you from forgetting
 Astrobytes: REinforcement learning eh
 MSmits: sure
 Astrobytes: I get ya though, can help a lot
 jacek: but you may stuck on local optima
 MSmits: you're stuck on one yourself jacek, when will you be doing convolution and policy&#160;?
 jacek: i might start with policy. convolution sounds too slow
 MSmits: recur se just used it in contest
 Marchete: conv is slow
 MSmits: must be reason for that
 jacek: because hes noob and cant into one hots
 MSmits: lol
 Marchete: but it's very useful for games with positioning
 Marchete: because you can rotate etc
 MSmits: like most boardgames
 Marchete: and it can extract features
 MSmits: wonder if its usefulf or oware, i dont think so personally
 jacek: i have n-tuples for that. so no motivation for me
 Marchete: but I can't understand how these N x hexboards convolve eachother
 MSmits: doesnt seem too hard, just use hex filters
 Marchete: I think it works better for 2D stuff
 MSmits: filter with neighbors
 Marchete: conv3x3 probably
 jacek: 2x3x2
 Marchete: on SC21
 Marchete: 2x3x2?
 Marchete: ahh hex
 jacek: yes
 Marchete: I haven't seen hex yet
 Marchete: as if normal conv wasn't hard
 MSmits: is it really hard, once you've gotten everything else down?
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: I tried to AVX2 it
 MSmits: i guess you're mostly talking about the c++ inference part
 Marchete: it was omg for me
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Marchete: inference with high performance
 MSmits: well if i ever get there i promise to share
 Marchete: if you do as simple array[]
 Marchete: it's not that hard
 MSmits: i see
 Marchete: I'll try to retake my oware bot
 Marchete: and finally convert it to a0
 MSmits: seems the perfect place to start
 MSmits: btw, i will be focusing on your mokka thingy. Don't go anywere the next month or 4 :P
 Marchete: but so many details: input definition, model, rollout count, cpuct constant, what to export as policy, hor many games, modified MCTS for PUCT, the noise added, the learning rate, function loss, etc etc etc 
 darkhorse64: a0 is the next step for me but I'll start with toy games
 MSmits: robo i think started with a0
 jacek: toy games like onitama eh
 MSmits: onitama is awesome&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: connect2
 jacek: back then a0 was only serious thing with nn for games
 darkhorse64: or ttt
 MSmits: well people used other nn stuff for csb
 MSmits: not a0
 MSmits: i think anyway
 darkhorse64: Games for which you know the optimal strategy to cross check and debug
 MSmits: it's a good idea
 jacek: but connect4 is solved
 jacek: no need for connect2
 MSmits: does it count if i know the optimal strategy from my opening books&#160;:)
 jacek: for 7x6 version?
 MSmits: no i have it just for 7x9, not solved yet, but pretty much
 MSmits: takes ages to finish even though its clear
 MSmits: draws eh
 darkhorse64: my 30+ years of programming experience tell me that it is of thee utmost importance to have good test cases to validate your code
 MSmits: yep, my 10 years say the same
 darkhorse64: clear draw but +3/4 against the pack chasers
 jacek: for c++, the compiler finds the error. for php, the client finds the error
 MSmits: darkhorse64 what do you mean
 MSmits: pack chasers
 jacek: stack fest?
 darkhorse64: the guys in hot pursuit behind us on the lb
 jrke: CG reverse sycology - eat then brew or cook then crop, SC20 then FC20 then SC21
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: did not see 
 MSmits: my latest book is not on there
 MSmits: I think I have a 13 million nodes based book but the 5 million is on there
 darkhorse64: I wonder what you did for such a strong bot. I have smart rollouts (avoiding all losing moves)
 darkhorse64: you booked C4
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah but its still best without book
 MSmits: book did little
 KalamariKing: when IS rank reeval
 MSmits: usually just first 4-5 moves
 jacek: and general book? not against someone?
 MSmits: yes general
 MSmits: which is why first 4-5 moves
 MSmits: if counter, then 20 moves 
 Wontonimo: were you able to book SC2021&#160;?
 MSmits: nah
 darkhorse64: Connect 4
 MSmits: didnt tr
 MSmits: y
 MSmits: doesnt seem likely
 MSmits: btw brb, picking up daughter from school
 struct: hello
 AmikOwO_: bre
 KalamariKing: hello str​uct
 Alihussain: hi
 MSmits: hmmph now i want to switch my meta mcts back to connect4
 MSmits: still have to parallelize that one
 Wontonimo: :wave: struct
 jacek: hmph
 MSmits: it was doing like 5 games /s on 1 core, because the games were mostly nearly solved before they start
 MSmits: with 8 cores this is gonna be crazy
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: well the game solves at ply 30 for most people
 MSmits: if you build a meta mcts tree, you easily get to 20 or beyond
 MSmits: so you can imagine what happens
 TundraShow: すっかりコンテスト忘れてた人(期間中まったくログインしなかった)Twitterやってないと感想も共有できないのつらい
 Tiramon: TundraShow in this channel plz type english
 MSmits: go here #twittertalk
 struct: #jp
 The_xD: hi me new here
 Tiramon: that happend to most of us&#160;;)
 MSmits: can you distinguish Japanese from other asian alphabets struct?
 Tiramon: google translate can do that .. 
 MSmits: oh nvm, you just looked at flag
 struct: yeah flag
 MSmits: maybe he was just posting an opening book he found on twitter
 MSmits: it looked like jaceks
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: jacek's are chinese characters no?
 MSmits: i think maybe his book is multilingual
 Wontonimo: hi The_xD
 Astrobytes: Japanese is quite distinguishable from Chinese
 MSmits: oh I don't doubt that
 MSmits: but you need to spend a few minutes to get the difference
 MSmits: like the difference between a goose and a swan
 MSmits: or a toad and a frog
 Tiramon: or atleast know one of both&#160;;)
 MSmits: or that yeah
 Wontonimo: there's a difference between a goose and  a swan?
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: many i guess
 AntiSquid: the japanese alphabets are somewhat more "readable" than chinese :D
 MSmits: Astrobytes knows, he's the expert on stuff that lives
 Wontonimo: if you are kayaking  and either attacks you, you'r fd
 jacek: weeb language is simpler
 jacek: and that was terrible opening book
 Astrobytes: If you're anywhere and either attacks you you're fked
 MSmits: lol
 ZarthaxX: hello
 MSmits: hi ZarthaxX
 struct: hi
 ZarthaxX: howdy all
 Astrobytes: I've been chased by both but only bitten by a swan :D
 Astrobytes: hey Zarthooo
 MSmits: oh, I did not know you had personal experience with these
 ZarthaxX: Astrobaytooooo
 AntiSquid: i've been chased by a squirrel a few times, think they want nuts
 Astrobytes: People use geese as guards on their property and there are loads of swans round my way
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jacksepticeye/comments/gzbqs9/these_fcking_canadian_geese/">https://www.reddit.com/r/jacksepticeye/comments/gzbqs9/these_fcking_canadian_geese/</a>
 MSmits: why are you trying to sneak onto people's property Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Farms and more rural properties I mean.
 Astrobytes: I've only been chased when I was a kid and we were nicking apples
 MSmits: aha!
 MSmits: beats a farmer with a gun
 Astrobytes: Oh we had those too
 Astrobytes: Firing salt/pepper cartridges at your legs
 Astrobytes: Bloody painful!
 MSmits: I'm thinking you already won at life really, no further achievements necessary
 MSmits: guns, wild animals, jeez
 Wontonimo: AstroGrills
 Astrobytes: Took a shortcut across a field and got chased by a herd of cows too.
 MSmits: because why not
 Tiramon: things i missed in life ... but won't ever miss =)
 Astrobytes: And a bull jumped a fence once and chased us, managed to get over the big stone wall just in time
 Astrobytes: That was the scariest tbh
 Tiramon: sounds pretty scary
 MSmits: no sht
 Astrobytes: I could feel it's breath as I was scaling the wall
 Wontonimo: i heard a farmer posted a sign on his property "Unless you can cross this field in 10sec, you wont outrun the bull"
 Astrobytes: It's true!
 Astrobytes: They are fking fast
 Astrobytes: Thankfully the wall was right near the fence or we would have been mauled
 MSmits: I only ever get attacked by my dog
 MSmits: its motto is: Attack first, identify later
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: not kidding :P
 MSmits: have to make sure she knows it;s me
 MSmits: it's a small dog, not much damage
 Astrobytes: Shout before you walk in the door etc
 MSmits: yea
 Astrobytes: My paternal grandparents had a violent pug with no teeth.
 MSmits: funny
 MSmits: must have been hard to eat though
 Astrobytes: It used to try and suck your hand as aggressively as it could
 Astrobytes: It had some teeth but not at the front
 MSmits: ahh o
 MSmits: k
 Astrobytes: It used to growl and huff and puff while you laughed at it.
 MSmits: it's weird, my dog can go completely psycho in 1 second and become super nice in another
 MSmits: predictably though
 Astrobytes: Dogs for ya. Cats are the same
 Astrobytes: But unpredictably.
 MSmits: yeah was gonna say
 MSmits: try not to pet a random cat on the street
 MSmits: often it will be ok
 MSmits: sometimes they will jump up and grab your neck
 Astrobytes: 'Try not to' - impossible.
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: we had a random cat a little ways away from the house that walked a street we had to avoid
 MSmits: one time we walked through there and it hunted our dog
 miszu: Good morning children. question for opening in othello. How many moves in advance do you put in your opening?
 MSmits: i had to pick my dog up and carry it for like 200 m.
 MSmits: before it gave up
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: it literally jumped to grab our doh
 MSmits: dog
 Astrobytes: Yeah, seen a lot of cats tormenting dogs
 MSmits: our dog is cat size, but a dog and cat of same size... no contest. Save your dog lol
 Astrobytes: I've seen 'em go for bigger dogs too. Depends on the temperament/breed of the dog.
 MSmits: when i was younger our house cat escaped, we found her 4 houses away on the back of a huge dogs which was whining and running around
 MSmits: huge dog
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: that's epic
 MSmits: yea, hmm first day outside, what to do
 Astrobytes: My friend had a Dogo Argentino, it got a cat once. It actually jumped off a 2nd floor balcony to chase it. That did not end well.
 MSmits: you cant just pull a cat off either. My mom got some serious scratches
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they hang on for grim life
 MSmits: yeah just leave the cat alone
 MSmits: they're not just mean to dogs either
 Astrobytes: All creatures great and small
 MSmits: they play real dirty
 MSmits: like pretend to be chill and then wait till the other cat turns around
 MSmits: dogs dont do that, they dont understand this behavior
 MSmits: 100% honest
 Astrobytes: So true :D
 MSmits: they also practice sneaking on random people, just for giggles
 MSmits: you will see them following you through yards of houses
 MSmits: when you pass them
 Astrobytes: Stalking
 MSmits: one time i walked for 15 min with a cat after me i entered my home and took a nap in front of my front door like it was waiting for me to come out and play
 MSmits: it took a nap i mean
 Astrobytes: Was gonna say :P
 MSmits: hehe 
 Marchete: cat's whisperer
 reCurse: This chat o.0
 ill-be-waiting-outside: hi
 miszu: btw reCurse congrats on winning the competition. I just noticed now you finished 1st and actually did a submission.
 reCurse: Thanks
 Astrobytes: hey at least we're talking :P
 Alshock: @miszuI guess at first you noticed he was first and then were surprised that he submitted
 reCurse: Oh not complaining, just funny to be the first thing to come to
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 jacek: :upside_down:
 jacek: if your policy output is 38, that mean GROW, COMPLETE and SEED in the same cell share their visits?
 reCurse: I literally coded COMPLETE as a GROW
 reCurse: Because there is zero overlap
 Marchete: I think it's good
 reCurse: I also pruned SEED to only have one source
 reCurse: So yes, policy is hex grid + 1 for wait
 MSmits: oh.. i did that too
 MSmits: the 1 source seed
 MSmits: didnt do sht for my bot, same rank, but it seemed like a really good idea :0
 reCurse: I mainly did it so the policy size does not go out of control
 MSmits: in my case it was because i hardcoded seed to be the last action of my day
 MSmits: so who cares which tree it comes from
 reCurse: I'm still curious if there is more safe pruning to do
 reCurse: I noticed my bot wasted a lot of time on seeds still
 MSmits: i did grow 3 before 2 before 1
 MSmits: did you do that?
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: seems only to matter when reacting to opponent
 Wontonimo: my 1 source was randomized.  i think in your PM recurs you used the largest tree
 reCurse: Yeah I made it deterministic
 reCurse: To give a chance for the NN to rely on something
 reCurse: I guess ordering grows is 100% safe
 reCurse: Not sure if that's where most of the time is wasted
 MSmits: well except when reacting to opponent
 reCurse: I'm fairly sure it's seeds
 reCurse: What do you mean
 MSmits: well if he knows you grow something to 3, he can react
 MSmits: if you do it later, he cant
 reCurse: Oh gotcha
 MSmits: but then its more expensive... so prolly not worth it
 MSmits: if you grow out of order it costs +1 sun
 MSmits: considering how close top games are
 Vova_s: growing 3 before 2 before 1 could be a bad thing. That is when you can grow aither two trees of size 1 and 2 or one tree of size 3 in single day
 MSmits: +1 sun is huge
 reCurse: Well it doesn't mean you can't grow 2
 reCurse: It's just you can't grow 3 after 2
 reCurse: So it's ordering pruning
 MSmits: Vova_s i dont mean favor growing 3
 MSmits: i mean if you already know which ones you're growing on a day
 MSmits: grow the big ones first
 jrke: maybe even growing the tree which are less on map
 jrke: saving extra sunpoint
 Vova_s: ah, in that case, sure, you should grow biggest tree first
 MSmits: yeah, that was my point
 MSmits: but the small counterpoint is that if you grow a tree to 3 first, the opponent knows which tree is going to cause more shading and use that info
 tobk: I thought about that too, grow the largest first (not to end up with many half-baked trees in the last turn) or most cost-effective
 MSmits: to make his own decision
 MSmits: but as i said +1 sun is huge so...
 putibuzu: Yes. I think you have to take into account the opponent and shading
 tobk: ended up growing biggest-first to play it safe (it's all pretty hard-coded), but might make it depend on the day or something
 reCurse: Next time I get serious I'll write a full mcts visualization
 Wontonimo: if it is the "best" decision, and the opponent is sane, then it should be done anyways
 reCurse: This opaqueness is starting to drive me nuts
 MSmits: I kinda have half of that in my meta mcts, but text only
 reCurse: Nah text is not enough
 MSmits: i mean, i can zoom up and down the tree and select nodes
 KareemTheDream: how do i do this clash code thing idk how to do it
 reCurse: Needs a proper UI to dig
 MSmits: but they dont appear as circles and stuff
 MSmits: just lists of children
 Wontonimo: do you have an example image from the web of what you are thinking of for visualization
 tobk: I'd just wish they'd come up with better names at least when the contests go MP. "My Neighbor Codetoro" would spring to mind...
 reCurse: They used to do that
 MSmits: tobk they had those before
 MSmits: go 2 yrs back for this
 reCurse: Switched to Season Challenge for... branding reasons?
 ZarthaxX: have you seen this reCurse <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.elgrapho.com/">https://www.elgrapho.com/</a>
 reCurse: I don't know
 ZarthaxX: dont know if it helps
 tobk: exactly, and now it's just "[Season] Challenge [Year]" forever?
 reCurse: Yeah Wontonimo check his website
 reCurse: The tree example
 reCurse: That's what I'm talking about
 reCurse: With the game state displayed on the right
 jrke: tobk you forgot Codingame at first
 jrke: "Codingame [Season] Challenge [Year]"
 MSmits: which website reCurse?
 reCurse: Zarthax's
 MSmits: oh the link
 MSmits: looks cool yeah
 jrke: this onw - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.elgrapho.com">https://www.elgrapho.com</a>?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codepen.io/ericdrowell/pen/qLYrEm">https://codepen.io/ericdrowell/pen/qLYrEm</a>
 ZarthaxX: i think i showed you this already MSmits
 jrke: one*
 MSmits: yeah i remember
 reCurse: I'd probably use colors to expose some information
 reCurse: Like visits, score, etc
 MSmits: i just wasnt sure if this was you showing me
 ZarthaxX: haha :P
 reCurse: And a slider to scrub through all iterations
 reCurse: etc
 MSmits: people show me good stuff all the time :0
 MSmits: forget who shows what
 ZarthaxX: gotta take notes smito
 MSmits: yeah i guess so :0
 ZarthaxX: ohhh the slider seems like acool idea
 Wontonimo: watcha thinking&#160;?  something like dump state to file, use something else to render it like javascript in html?
 MSmits: oh wow, if you're going to store iterations then the storage will be huuuuge
 reCurse: I still hit the inner reflex where I stop when I think I say too much
 MSmits: reCurse dont worry about sharing the visual tool ideas, these ideas are not why you win
 ZarthaxX: true
 Wontonimo: cuz if it's a dump to file then browse, i'd be happy to contribute to that project
 reCurse: You say that but
 MSmits: the actual building of them is and the ideas you get during contest
 MSmits: yes but you *do* it
 MSmits: others can have these ideas
 reCurse: Most of the progress in whatever work I do is usually done through such tools
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: but they are not particularly inventive. You're just good at building them and you actually invest time
 MSmits: the inventiveness is in the bot
 reCurse: Alright, fine
 reCurse: I might not be competitive for a long time for all I know
 reCurse: I was thinking of hosting a REST server in the C++ bot
 Marchete: child?
 reCurse: And using web frontend
 reCurse: So you don't need storage
 Astrobytes: Clever
 Marchete: I'm lost, but it's ok
 reCurse: I mean it feels good to share stuff
 reCurse: But as I mentioned in forums
 reCurse: I also get the impression when I do that I slowly sign retirement
 Marchete: to be honest
 reCurse: And it breaks my heart&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: you'd need to keep the process running, so not good for brutal tester
 ZarthaxX: no way lol
 MSmits: yep, also, I tend to share more if i perform worse. I totally get shutting down on sharing when you're winning :P
 Marchete: your last sentence seemed a farewell to me, recurse
 putibuzu: Knowing in principle how to smth is very different from actually doing it, especially when it comes to this NN stuff
 reCurse: It might be, it might not, I don't know
 reCurse: If it happens it won't be an official thing
 reCurse: It's just gonna happen
 MSmits: I sense that you think you need to make some final decision. Pb 4 retired before
 MSmits: and came back
 MSmits: and won some
 reCurse: Not going to lie I'm nervous about it
 Marchete: yeah, sometimes it's cyclic
 reCurse: Don't know what to expect&#160;:)
 jacek: addict reaction
 Marchete: if it's about the child, it will be fine, I had mine around your age
 MSmits: dont worry so much about the cg side of things. It should not feel like an obligation anyways. You've won a bunch here, noone can take that away anyway. Just come here when you have time
 Wontonimo: don't psych yourself out.  Admit that it is actually hard after having achieved num1 becuase the tendency is to make that now your new standard
 struct: you can still have fun and not be competitive 
 Marchete: :D
 MSmits: that last one is a bridge too far struct :P
 MSmits: dont think he can do that :P
 Astrobytes: I think he was subtly using the CG 5% thing
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: *95%
 Marchete: CoC and its random invites will always be there for you :grin:
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: The schoolkids will always be waiting...
 MSmits: find an escape room to relax in
 Marchete: a hardcore escape room can be fun. I thought about it some time ago
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: i still haven't tried the escape room here
 Marchete: I mean more like an optim puzzle
 Marchete: having N puzzles inside, and each one gives points and give codes for other puzzles
 Wontonimo: i've tried the in-person escape room thing.  i suck at it
 MSmits: sure, stuff like that could be ok Marchete
 Marchete: I even had some of them :D
 MSmits: I prefer just doing random puzzles on my own probably
 MSmits: i suck at teamwork 
 Wontonimo: the great thing about solo work is not having to manage other peoples reaction to my frustration rage fits
 KalamariKing: Exactly!
 MSmits: lol
 ththththt: I love ma daily java
 MSmits: I just become really slow and indecisive in a team
 MSmits: either make me boss or let me work on my own&#160;:)
 jacek: wood boss?
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: i've never had a bot that became boss before&#160;:(
 MSmits: i guess they dont like search bots
 ZarthaxX: because you are alwaysa on top&#160;;)
 MSmits: nahh, at one time maybe
 ZarthaxX: trying to cheer you up
 MSmits: i know, thanks. I am ok though&#160;:)
 MSmits: cant wait till i have some free time to get into the nn thing
 Krakenus00: How do you get that cool contest badge as eulerscheZahl has?
 MSmits: not sure what you mean
 struct: search bots = more cost
 MSmits: but euler has a lot of cool
 Astrobytes: CG Premium Account
 MSmits: wait what
 ZarthaxX: oh no NNSmits
 ZarthaxX: D:
 Astrobytes: How does the CG Premium Account thing still reel people in?!
 MSmits: ohh, he did a badge in his about page
 Astrobytes: *Why
 MSmits: I'm easy pickins Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: Krakenus00 it's just his profile
 Astrobytes: He embedded it there a few contests back
 MSmits: you can put anything in that part
 Krakenus00: Yeah, I know, but where did he get that?
 MSmits: oh, good question, maybe he made it himself
 MSmits: but he also has "connections"
 struct: I think they emailed it on the prveious contest
 Marchete: you can put images there...
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's what it was struct
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: it's kinda weird, i mean he did like 20 contests
 MSmits: now it seems like he did 1
 MSmits: he needs to make 20 badges now
 Marchete: unnecessary task succesfully completed
 MSmits: I'm guessing this might be euler humor though
 MSmits: often i get it, but sometimes i just sense it right beyond my capabilities
 Krakenus00: I've just found that badge in google, xd
 MSmits: well go put it in your profile
 icecream17: I just came back, and i've been promoted to gold? Any news on spring challenge?
 Krakenus00: It's over

 TheBatMan_TM: except repl.it
 davilla: yes
 davilla: I don't know what that means
 davilla: sorry, best response I got
 non5: aws cloud9
 BeardedJotunn: Is there a rule on this site or something that you always round answers, and that you always round down? Someone asking for a distance in meters doesn't mean whole meters to me, 8.549m is in meters. But when dealing with distance rounding down definitely makes no sense, but I've seen it in a few clashes now.
 non5:&#160;?
 TheBatMan_TM: aws cloud9?
 non5: ys
 TheBatMan_TM: is that free?
 davilla: BeardedJotunn make a comment in feedback, it should be in the description not a rule
 KalamariKing: BeardedJotunn I don't believe so, although maybe

 GlitchFox: u refreshed?
 BeardedJotunn: Alright, yeah I made a comment on that one for sure, keep doing that. Not sure I should complain on all the ones that expect you to round without telling me, because that's soooo many :P
 9gress0r: yep
 BeardedJotunn: Thanks!
 9gress0r: there are just my progress bar 
 9gress0r: thats all
 9gress0r: and definition of loops
 jacek: mars lander 1?
 Wontonimo: Hey GlitchFox, so try alternating between thrust 4 and 3 every other round
 Krakenus00: GlitchFox just thrust
 Krakenus00: I've completed the first level just with 0 and 4
 rohrokz: any java bois here?
 KalamariKing: possibly
 KalamariKing: why
 creeperZnation4: What's up?
 Krakenus00: reject Javaembrace C++
 creeperZnation4: Did u just wanna know how many of us are here XD
 creeperZnation4: I'm convinced that C++ is just D
 creeperZnation4: Ok that was a bad joke
 creeperZnation4: XD
 Krakenus00: I C
 Krakenus00: btw
 creeperZnation4: yeah?
 Krakenus00: does anyone use Clojure?
 creeperZnation4: Can't say I've heard of it
 Krakenus00: I've never heard about it before joining CG xd
 rohrokz: what is it
 creeperZnation4: Care to explain XD
 Krakenus00: Programming language
 creeperZnation4: Ah ok
 Krakenus00: Oh
 Krakenus00: It just a Java Lisp
 KalamariKing: wdym
 KalamariKing: how can a programming language have a lisp
 creeperZnation4: lol XD
 jacek: java html
 creeperZnation4: can you mix java and html together?
 creeperZnation4: like not with applets and api calls and whatnot
 Krakenus00: creeperZnation4 do you mean JHTML?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theserverside.com/definition/JHTML-Java-within-Hypertext-Markup-Language">https://www.theserverside.com/definition/JHTML-Java-within-Hypertext-Markup-Language</a>
 Marchete: in alphazero there is a thing about temperature, but in some documents they say temp=1.0, hence not using it (because c_puct can be tweaked for that), it's right?
 jacek: afair they use temp=1 for first 30 moves then temp=0 (exploit) for the rest
 AllYourTrees: lol reCurse i think i found some untrained state space <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/558036339">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/558036339</a>
 AllYourTrees: is that related to your win percentage getting to high that you mentioned in your post?
 reCurse: Let me check
 Marchete: not on root, no?
 reCurse: Starting to massively overcorrect on turn 30 o.0
 reCurse: Sounds like it
 Marchete: I need to review that more
 reCurse: The problem with my hack is it can start doing stupid stuff
 reCurse: Like cutting trees early to boost score
 jacek: Marchete if youre refering to softmax temperature, its about choosing the final move
 reCurse: I usually rely on the win&#160;% dropping enough so regular NN can go back and play
 jacek: more exploration is done via dirichlet noise applied to root
 AllYourTrees: ahhh ya
 reCurse: But it could also create too much damage
 reCurse: A proper solution would fix those issues, but I wasn't going to restart a training on the last day
 AllYourTrees: fair
 reCurse: I might try out of curiosity
 reCurse: But take the next few days of a contest with a huge grain of salt
 reCurse: There's leftover motivation that turns out to be unfounded soon after
 reCurse: Contest adrenaline wearing off, something like that
 AllYourTrees: lol i've felt that before
 AllYourTrees: i haven't been able to sustain motivation outside of the contest
 AllYourTrees: i always am like oh yeah i can just work on this whenever nice
 AllYourTrees: and then i dont&#160;:|
 reCurse: Not a bad thing
 reCurse: I suspect I burned out a few times because of that
 AllYourTrees: good point
 Marchete: ahhhhh normalized visits
 Marchete: I get it
 AllYourTrees: alright see ya'll later :wave:
 Marchete: no I don't lol
 reCurse: :wave:
 Al_ir_eza00: hello guys whats up?
 Al_ir_eza00: :smiley:
 Wontonimo: just chatting about the competition that just ended
 Wontonimo: what up with you?
 jacek: hmm this policy isnt that hard. quick &amp; dirty hacks allowed me for a little inferior bot than mine
 eulerscheZahl: nice, dice duel already approved. and once again I forgot the cover image
 jacek: then who the ^&amp;!@ approved it :rage:
 jrke: jacek one of those approvals belongs to you also
 jacek: :innocent:
 eulerscheZahl: that's the joke
 Wontonimo: that was past jace, this is present jace
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl, your badge image in the profile is some kind of joke?
 struct: Where is the badge for this contest, did they not email it?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i really participated in that contest
 Marchete: and 23 others
 eulerscheZahl: nope, no badge for spring
 struct: but they made one ...
 jacek: this is his participation medal
 eulerscheZahl: last time they sent one per email and i wasn't sure what to do with it other than that
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0y1q0SXsAE9ZOl?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0y1q0SXsAE9ZOl?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096</a>
 jrke: looks great struct
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they send an email without the stuff around, then I can add this to my profile too
 eulerscheZahl: for the 95%
 Marchete: many top 10 and you put a participation medal. Smits thought it was some kind of elaborated joke
 reCurse: It is
 eulerscheZahl: they didn't send be a badge for those placements  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
 ProjectKoe257: I need some help in coders strike back
 jacek: mhm
 fenrir: reCurse: for the hack on value, it might be because tanh is saturing out, making every move look the same (I had an issue like that sometimes), using +/- 0.5 instead kinda work
 fenrir: (in case you are using tanh for the value head)
 jacek: use relu for value, then there is no losing :v
 reCurse: +/- 0.5? What do you mean
 fenrir: +0.5 for a win, -0.5 for a loss
 reCurse: How would it help though?
 fenrir: it leaves room above 0.5
 reCurse: But what defines it?
 jacek: oh right, how can you go above 1.0 with tanh
 cegprakash: I have a feeling my eval and euler's eval is almost the same.. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/9?u=cegprakash">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/9?u=cegprakash</a> may be I should have increased depth and tried.. also I did similar opp prediction with only one opponent who always Grows
 cegprakash: but I ended up only in gold 300 with minimax at depth 1.. I tried GA at a depth of 5 and I could reach gold 400
 reCurse: I mean how would it get 0.5 to 1? It seems like it might be random
 cegprakash: and it was worser than my minimax
 cegprakash: I mean GA at a depth of 5 days
 cegprakash: minimax at a depth of 1 frame
 cegprakash: my 1 frame minimax performed better than GA at depth 5
 fenrir: the NN may overestimate the value and so be a little above 0.5, but the action ranking may be valid 
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: I don't know if it's a reliable overestimation though
 reCurse: Could be worth a shot
 reCurse: Another idea I had is to remove the tanh past a certain value
 reCurse: And also cross fingers
 fenrir: when I tried qlearning, it did help
 reCurse: Interesting
 fenrir: the value was not accurated, but the ranking was
 reCurse: Thanks for the hint
 fenrir: not sure it will help but...
 fenrir: you can also use a linear output, but I don't think it is better than reducing the output range with tanh
 Marchete: half the range is not a lot?
 fenrir: I tried 0.5  et 0.8, were similar in my tests 
 Marchete: ahh, ok
 fenrir: but yeah 0.8 might also work well
 reCurse: I think tanh helps for the vast majority of cases
 Krakenus00: Yeah, now I have that cool badge
 reCurse: But it's possible some contrast can be had if it starts outputting big values that are invisible after tanh
 reCurse: But I really have doubts on its accuracy
 fenrir: the issue is than tanh() +/- 0.5 make it near linear
 reCurse: Or even its validity
 fenrir: but it is better than linear as it acts a bit like a soft clip to avoid propagating large wrong value (at least in the begining)
 fenrir: and cliping create the same issue, flatten everything
 Chainman: Oh cool I got 3.6k codingame points from the springchallenge 2021
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: This reminds me of soft labels
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Definitely potential there
 cegprakash: miklla what a legend
 cegprakash: used DP
 cegprakash: while we were all searching
 fenrir: and the gradient get killed when near +/-1
 Wontonimo: something that helped with one of my NNs (not CG) was something that was called visual loss.  There is this problem of using abs(signal) or sqr(signal)
 fenrir: so hard to go back from it when learned a wrong value
 reCurse: Yeah it's quite insightful fenrir
 reCurse: Makes me think of a few things
 Wontonimo: where abs(signal) gave very crisp results but everything was muted, and sqr(result) gave blurry results but high contrast.  using both was magic
 Wontonimo: so, perhaps you can use tanh for the crisp win/loss, but also add in a small linear signal to give some gradient 
 fenrir: so probably a tradeoff between easier learning but making it a bit harder to learn some value
 fenrir: I mean not on the same case
 Wontonimo: maybe&#160;: tanh(score) + 0.1*tanh(score/20)
 reCurse: I'm just curious if it will end up having something &gt; 0.5 translate into winning more reliably
 Wontonimo: the second tanh(score/20) will give sensitivity to greater spread in winning)
 Chainman: In the email they said "Mai 6-17 2021"
 reCurse: Or if it will be random noise leftover from linear coefficients
 fenrir: unsure, I know in my case it made learning more stable but unsure if you have a stable learning if it helps
 reCurse: Like soft labeling helps with the gradient issue you mention
 reCurse: Which is the same trick, use 0.9-hot encoding
 reCurse: To leave some room
 reCurse: But what goes above is quite undefined
 reCurse: Yeah I don't know maybe it helps in other ways if not with the 'winning more' issue
 fenrir: another way I would see is using a gamma (on day) even if not really needed, but maybe that will make training harder
 reCurse: No clue&#160;:) Many things to try for sure
 Chainman: does the rank change in multiplayer version of spring challenge 2021? 
 fenrir: yeah, but it's hard to be sure of the result, not sure how you trainig was reproductible, but depending in the seed, the exact learning rate scheduling, etc  a lot changes
 reCurse: Oh yeah tell me about it... I kind of give up making sense of what really helps vs what doesn't and rely on instinct/experience...
 fenrir: yeah, if we had a server farm, then a good old grid search, otherwise...
 jacek: clop :v
 reCurse: It's really tough in that kind of RL setting, how long should let it train for before comparing against other agents, etc
 reCurse: I kind of just reused the same run that started working and piling on it
 fenrir: I had seen an article that show that the main gain of PPO was due to everything but the main PPO change
 reCurse: Oh yeah I saw that
 reCurse: Implementation matters&#160;:)
 fenrir: yep&#160;:)
 jacek: PPO?
 reCurse: Was funny if not sad
 fenrir: Proximal Policy Optimization
 reCurse: The holy grail of OpenAI
 reCurse: For Dota 2 among others
 fenrir: this one I failed to have good result with it in self-play
 fenrir: not sure why
 reCurse: I only tried it to train a runner in CSB
 reCurse: Completely destroyed all others
 reCurse: In terms of training speed etc
 fenrir: a runner alone&#160;?
 reCurse: Yeah
 fenrir: yes that ok, but in self play I failed to have good result
 reCurse: I used that as a benchmark to compare different ways
 fenrir: not sure why
 reCurse: Yeah self play is hard
 reCurse: That's why I stuck to "how long for a good runner"
 reCurse: Very quick and measurable
 fenrir: ok
 reCurse: I wanted to try getting it to work for self-play
 reCurse: But I kind of gave up on model-free approaches
 fenrir: if you do and it works for you, I would like to know (toknow that I have to look for bug in my code&#160;:))
 reCurse: Hehe noted
 reCurse: I just plugged my mcts nodes into a graph lib, nice snowflake
 reCurse: This is getting too dangerous of a time sink
 jacek: :tada:
 Wontonimo: navigating 20,000 nodes should be no problem.  5 hours later...
 reCurse: Can even drag nodes and it reacts with physics

 MSmits: ClockSort it's really really easy to get to bronze
 eulerscheZahl: ClockSort always print the first legal action and you'll promote
 ClockSort: not if you play random moves, apparently.
 MSmits: just code something like prefer center, otherwise corner or something
 ClockSort: it's crazy that isn't working
 jrke: jacek bronze rules are not there i think
 jrke: only 2 levels are there
 ClockSort: i have to write a three-in-a-row finder  maybe&#160;:(
 MSmits: there are only two games jrke
 Wontonimo: i thought there were only 2 levels of rules
 MSmits: normal TTT and 9 board TTT (uttt)

 MSmits: your ntuple system
 jacek: ah
 MSmits: for TTT
 MSmits: know what all the lines of code do&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks
 ClockSort: it's a good piece of a bot
 jacek: *bookmarked* not to never look at it again
 MSmits: for a game where all you do is print first legal action to win :P
 jacek: its bitboard, youll gonna need it later
 ClockSort: i'll make a better bitboard than this
 jrke: so i was right during contest that my BS needs a better eval
 MSmits: make tritboard&#160;:)
 LeviathanProgramming: Hey guys, if you want to win more clashes, a trick is to launch it off when it's just you and another person
 LeviathanProgramming: That's what I do
 LeviathanProgramming: I just start before the really good clashers join
 jacek: start clash then leave :imp:
 Kingasasin177: Bonjour
 ClockSort: backup strat: become really good clasher
 Chainman: lol, 
 Kingasasin177: Then no one wants to go against you
 Wontonimo: even better
 ClockSort: clash annoys me because golfing 
 MSmits: ye when I play clash I always think, man even golf would be more fun
 jacek: you play clash? oO
 Kingasasin177: Good thing you can golf code
 ClockSort: ...
 MSmits: i did 50 times
 MSmits: thats a lot you know
 MSmits: they forced me to do it because quest map
 jacek: no one 'forced' you
 jacek: the gamification worked
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: they gamificated me
 Krakenus00: Get gamificated
 Krakenus00: Actually, it is not that bad
 Krakenus00: Btw I learned Python and Ruby only to win in CoC
 Kingasasin177: Python can be a bit cheaty in some scenarios compared to other languages
 Krakenus00: What about ruby with its "p" command for printing?
 Krakenus00: However, I've been winning in fastest modes with C++, so Python is not that big pain in the ass

 Saphine: Happens
 Saphine: :grimacing:
 LeviathanProgramming: I only use JS
 Saphine: Js is good
 Wontonimo: I only use assembly, but usually indirectly
 ClockSort: you need ruby to win golf
 ClockSort: and i don't have ruby
 ClockSort: therefore i don't win golf
 ClockSort: i golf in JS and it hurts.
 jacek: try in golf fields
 struct: you need perl
 jacek: all you need is love
 Krakenus00: all you need is O(n log n) sorting algorithm
 Kingasasin177: Dang, I just had a clash of code that had geometry math that I didn't know because of covid rip
 KalamariKing: lmao
 KalamariKing: what was it I wanna see if I know
 Kingasasin177: My geometry class did not teach us anything besides intro to sin, cos, tan
 KalamariKing: was it the geometric mean coc?
 Kingasasin177: It's just asking to find the area of a shape based on number of sides and side lengths but I don't know how to do that one rip
 KalamariKing: oh rip
 jacek: rip?
 Kingasasin177: Rest in peace
 KalamariKing: shred

 Astrobytes: It's a Megadeth album.
 pmor: They must be too young to experience the tranquility of Megadeth
 Kingasasin177: Yeah thats it jacek
 Astrobytes: Guess so pmor&#160;:/
 Kingasasin177: I'm decent at math but I don't know enough of it to be good in things like that
 Krakenus00: Hm, I learned that in school
 Wontonimo: i know enough math to know that 2+2=5 for large enough 2s
 Kingasasin177: I did not Krakenus rip
 Krakenus00: You just need to split that polygon into triangles, find their area and multiply it by their count
 Kingasasin177: My geometry class was 50% proofs, 40% introductory sin, cos, tan, and 50% covid online
 Kingasasin177: More like 70-80% proofs
 Wontonimo: yeah, that sounds like what my geometry hs class was like also
 jacek: 50%+40%+50% = 140%, dat math
 Krakenus00: Did covid really hit all your education? Cause at university I feel the same, maybe even better.
 Kingasasin177: I'm not in uni
 Krakenus00: I understand, that's why I'm asking
 Kingasasin177: and yeah it effected it pretty badly, I learned nothing during spring semester last year and had to go most of this school year online which hurt my grades and learning a decent amount
 Chainman: Can I pop out this chat, it is very uncomfortable looking at it in a thin corner of screen.
 Kingasasin177: I do agree it is uncomfortable having to use this chat but I'm used to it cause of twitch
 jacek: add ?disableChat in url
 davilla: who had the math question?
 Chainman: no that just removes chat,
 Chainman: I want to see chat 
 Kingasasin177: he wants chat to be bigger
 Astrobytes: He means pop it out into a separate window jacek. No, unfortunately.
 jacek: ?makeThisChatBiggerAndPopOut
 Chainman: lol
 Chainman: serio?
 Astrobytes: With some CSS fiddling yes
 Krakenus00: Just ctrl + "+" xd
 Kingasasin177: Gotta love url queries
 Chainman: That is not optimal Krakenus00
 davilla: oh Kraken already answered the math question
 Kingasasin177: Yeah, what he said is pretty much what I did but it didn't work out 100% because of the fact that there were triangles and stuff as well
 davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://calcresource.com/geom-ngon.html">https://calcresource.com/geom-ngon.html</a>

 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQkjh26asaY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQkjh26asaY</a> euler
 Marchete: neither me
 Astrobytes: Big fan were you?
 jacek: import nn. nn.code() [solved]
 eulerscheZahl: at times I was, yes
 AntiSquid: zelda is a princess, you play a character link in the game Legend of Zelda to save the princess
 AntiSquid: kinda like mario
 eulerscheZahl: then Pro7 replaced it by Malcolm in the middle which I also liked
 AllYourTrees: just use a nn to code another nn
 Astrobytes: I think I've seen every episode of Sabrina up until late 90s, my sister was a huge fan. It was kinda funny at times.
 struct: What would be the best game to try NN?
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen most of them at least. not sure if all
 struct: oware?
 AntiSquid: oware probably
 struct: bt?
 Astrobytes: Oware seems to be the standard so far.
 AllYourTrees: whats oware?
 Astrobytes: Oware Abapa
 AntiSquid: i mean which one has lowest amount of inputs&#160;? :P
 AllYourTrees: oooh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa</a>
 struct: cya in a few years when I have my NN ready
 AllYourTrees: i was thinking breakthrough could be good too
 AntiSquid: we can visit you at your retirement home to catch up on your NN struct
 jacek: NN for breakthrough? i dont know...
 AntiSquid: wait actually what about CSB struct&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or rather Search Race optimization 
 struct: i have 0 experience with it
 AntiSquid: no i mean for lower input count
 AntiSquid: faster to train i bet
 Astrobytes: that's why people use Oware
 struct: my problem is not training
 AntiSquid: what is it&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/">https://pytorch.org/tutorials/</a>
 King_Coda: :ring:
 Marchete: PCR NN
 struct: implementing it
 jfaixo: fall 2020 was the board game Century
 AllYourTrees: pytorch has a really nice python interface, and you can even export the NN to something you can use in c++ with their c++ api
 AntiSquid: search race&#160;:One line of 6 integers&#160;!!
 AntiSquid: no need to take into account all CP for the NN
 Astrobytes: Sim is more complex. Oware sim is a dawdle.
 Astrobytes: Less to worry about.
 AntiSquid: no sim
 AllYourTrees: how are Code of Kutulu and Mean Max?
 AntiSquid: was thinking of different approach, not of NN that gives value to a move
 Astrobytes: AllYourTrees: you'll have to ask them yourself I haven't seen them for a while :P
 AllYourTrees: Astrobytes :facepalm:
 AntiSquid: code of kutulu you can get legend with heuristics too apparently, but sim shouldn't be too hard
 AntiSquid: mean max is random but fun
 AntiSquid: look at replays on the leaderboard 
 AntiSquid: anyways, both better than totoro imo
 Astrobytes: For NN approach?!
 AntiSquid: i thought he meant in general
 AllYourTrees: ya in general
 Astrobytes: Oh ok. Then yeah I agree. But your mileage may vary of course.
 AntiSquid: i recommend kutulu out of the 2
 AllYourTrees: kk ty!
 eulerscheZahl: have fun with it AllYouSanity
 eulerscheZahl: Your*
 AllYourTrees: lolol
 Astrobytes: lol 
 eulerscheZahl: i was hoping to see you as AllYourTriangles once&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: If he goes MM it'll be AllYourWater
 AllYourTrees: triangles??
 eulerscheZahl: AllYourRage
 Astrobytes: TryangleCatch
 eulerscheZahl: rage is also mean max
 Astrobytes: yep
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/mhm-4kDBhio?t=38">https://youtu.be/mhm-4kDBhio?t=38</a>
 Astrobytes: I quite liked that movie actually. Far superior to the original Mad Max movies
 eulerscheZahl: 20s ad before? tab closed
 AntiSquid: lol use ublock 
 Astrobytes: No ad here
 AntiSquid: i have no ads
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still chatting with firefox that i rarely use
 eulerscheZahl: laggy chat is worse in chromium
 eulerscheZahl: but can't open Dice Duel in Firefox, the 3D is evil
 jacek: approvers should check if the game is browser friendly
 AntiSquid: need 3D game that makes you think in 3D space for your bots
 AntiSquid: approvers might have better pc
 Astrobytes: It's approved?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: since this morning
 Astrobytes: Oh nice, I didn't see it.
 jacek: and it has cover
 eulerscheZahl: in firefox i didn't either :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Hm. It's only the game view that's 3D in Dice Duel isn't it? 
 eulerscheZahl: the dice geometry somehow is if you want to simulate
 Astrobytes: Yes, I guess the transforms would be faster.
 Astrobytes: We need a full on 3D multi now
 eulerscheZahl: let's say it's easier to see what's going on with a 3D viewer than in 2D
 Astrobytes: True.
 AntiSquid: WOLF 3D
 jacek: hmm in my last battles the boss has the default avatar oO
 Kingasasin177: What are you even really supposed to do to improve in Bronze league of the pod racing game
 AntiSquid: depends on your bot
 AntiSquid: nobody knows what you even tried
 AntiSquid: ah wait, -3*vel to next check point&#160;! :D
 struct: euler why cant you open it on firefiox?
 struct: firefox*
 Kingasasin177: I mean I don't know what you can even do to improve, they add collisions but it's not like anyones doing much to prevent colliding so it's pretty much a 50-50 regardless of your bot
 eulerscheZahl: it's just extremely laggy
 eulerscheZahl: maybe hardware acceleration off
 eulerscheZahl: too lazy to find the setting
 AntiSquid: lol it has a full landscape background
 AntiSquid: how long did that take you&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: a skybox
 eulerscheZahl: took 2 or 3 weeks for the whole thing
 eulerscheZahl: not in full-time of course, just some weekend or afternoon coding
 jacek: Kingasasin177 target - 3*vel [solved]
 eulerscheZahl: animating the rotations was painful, had a lot of rotations around the wrong axis at first
 struct: if I ever manage to make a NN Ill port arimaa
 Kingasasin177: what jacek?
 AntiSquid: background is just a plain image? at first i thought it's a full 3D model too :D
 eulerscheZahl: no arimaa on CG, i see
 eulerscheZahl: check the bottom links
 eulerscheZahl: it's 6 single images
 jacek: isnt aarima copyrighted?
 Astrobytes: struct was gonna do it at some point in the past iirc
 eulerscheZahl: isn't Onitama too?
 AntiSquid: next step add extra skyboxes in config settings to switch between them
 eulerscheZahl: so far no one complained :innocent:
 jacek: its alright for tutorial game
 AntiSquid: isn't a lot of the stuff on CG copyrighted?
 Astrobytes: The people who did last contest's board game complained. On YT at least
 eulerscheZahl: link?
 AntiSquid: what did they complaion about&#160;?
 Astrobytes: That's why the link and credit appeared
 eulerscheZahl: interesting, didn't know
 Astrobytes: It's on Guarav Sen's tut video
 Astrobytes: I didn't watch the video past a quick skim as it was useless, but I read the comments
 struct: you can copyright the name
 struct: not the game
 struct: iirc
 struct: but im no lawyer
 eulerscheZahl: found the comment, you are right
 eulerscheZahl: i mean astro is right about the comment
 AntiSquid: well change name change artwork add slightly different rules
 Astrobytes: Not the pinned one, did you see the other one?
 eulerscheZahl: i expanded and saw a reply
 eulerscheZahl: let me scroll down and read more
 AntiSquid: games copy each other all the time anyway, ever heard of how many diablo clones there are&#160;?
 Astrobytes: "@Blue Orange  this is our mistake, we're very sorry about it. Now, the game is mentioned in the challenge. Thank you for a great game."
 AntiSquid: just finished Path of Exile today btw
 Astrobytes: In the "Side Note: That's the game idea of the board game Photosynthesis. Good game&#160;:)" comment thread
 jacek: you can 'finish' it?
 AntiSquid: well got to act 10
 eulerscheZahl: so, let's try to port Catan next and see what happens?
 AntiSquid: i mean finished act 10, don't care about it anymore lol
 Astrobytes: lol
 AllYourTrees: PoE is pretty crazy
 Kingasasin177: Rip only 66th in Bronze league of the pod racer
 AllYourTrees: +1 to catan, or any game with trading would be cool (don't know if there already is)
 Astrobytes: I'm guessing this is why they didn't go nuts asking for streamers this contest
 AntiSquid: tons of little mechanics and things to do ... i skipped most content and just basically speed run with a fire mage
 eulerscheZahl: the captain sonar guys where more happy about the CG contest. even wanted to provide some sprites. don't know why it didn't happen in the end. probably on too short notice
 eulerscheZahl: but i can totally understand that photosynthesis wants credits
 AntiSquid: can still happen after contest? &amp;
 Astrobytes: Yeah, most people are cool about ports, as long as there's a credit somewhere
 AntiSquid: ya i'd want credit too if my board game wasn't that popular yet
 eulerscheZahl: for Onitama one player even dropped me a private message telling me that it looks nice and he'll buy the board game
 jacek: oh my
 Astrobytes: that's awesome
 jacek: i saw someone bought photosyntesis (or the hex board) to analyze the game
 AllYourTrees: i kinda wanna buy photosynthesis haha
 Astrobytes: Now demand a percentage from them
 AllYourTrees: i think my fam would like the trees, they are beautiful
 AllYourTrees: well i would also
 eulerscheZahl: i want to buy it. and then sit there with my laptop playing against the others
 AllYourTrees: :P
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: lol
 AllYourTrees: lets just play photosynthesis in a forest near you
 eulerscheZahl: gabbek was working on something to play human vs bot. with Blazor so it's really easy to insert a C# bot (for coders of the realm)
 Astrobytes: oh cool
 jacek: blazor?
 eulerscheZahl: i got to learn a bit of blazor on the job
 eulerscheZahl: microsoft's web framework
 eulerscheZahl: C# both server side and client side, no JS needed
 eulerscheZahl: some overhead as you either keep a connection open to execute all the code on the server
 AntiSquid: damn people still do their darnest to avoid JS
 eulerscheZahl: or you send a dll and execute it via WebAssembly
 jacek: so secure *.*
 AntiSquid: but how will the interface bot and human work?
 eulerscheZahl: that would have to be coded
 eulerscheZahl: that's where the porting work goes
 AntiSquid: and you can't request to play directly vs a bot on the leaderboard as a human
 AntiSquid: which btw would be more interesting imo than the escape rooms
 eulerscheZahl: you need 2 steps to play vs a C# bot: slightly modify the interaction protocol (if you don't want to run it as a separate process)
 Astrobytes: So you could use a C++ dll? Or it would have to be WASM?
 eulerscheZahl: and write a UI that can also forward the user interactions
 eulerscheZahl: and a referee
 Astrobytes: *converted to
 eulerscheZahl: Blazor brings a .net runtime via WASM
 eulerscheZahl: or you run the codes server-side, then it's more language agnostic (starting as a separate process)
 Astrobytes: Yes, I was meaning server side
 jacek: well i would like to play some games against the bots
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 eulerscheZahl: and the dll is at risk of decompilation
 Astrobytes: Hm.
 eulerscheZahl: maybe that will be my project for the coming holidays :thinking:
 jacek: holidays?
 eulerscheZahl: just a few public holidays
 eulerscheZahl: Pfingsten, don't ask me how it's called in English
 jacek: its in sunday
 eulerscheZahl: something religious, didn't go to church in decades
 jacek: unless you work on sundays
 Astrobytes: Some post-Easter celebration iirc
 eulerscheZahl: 13 May	Thu	Ascension Day 	National23 May	Sun	Whit Sunday 	BB24 May	Mon	Whit Monday 	
 Astrobytes: Whit Sunday, yes
 eulerscheZahl: and the day off on thursday results in a day off on friday too, my factory is closed
 eulerscheZahl: i can work if i want. but i have to file a formal request for it
 Astrobytes: Nice
 raillou: helo
 eulerscheZahl: not gonna happen obviously
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: is it extra pay for those days if you work?
 AntiSquid: here they put me automatically on annual leave so they don't pay me extra lol
 eulerscheZahl: i have to burn overtime that i colelcted before
 dbf: keep it for next contest&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i still have lots of holidays that i can take
 eulerscheZahl: more than CG needs for contests these days&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: take some for RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: and raic is too long to take off
 AntiSquid: or even gocoder&#160;!!
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps AntiSquid around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/22691032646401" /> dbf: #1 in raic spend 2 weeks vacation for it
 struct: just wait until they announce the 3 contesnts per year
 jacek: ez exp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/EkbX46S.png">https://i.imgur.com/EkbX46S.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i just start hating every game after 1-2 weeks, RAIC is no exception
 eulerscheZahl: taking off wont result in me playing the contest
 AntiSquid: why hate every game?
 struct: and probably you dont gain much of an advantange for taking the days off
 eulerscheZahl: there were discussions if this should be removed jacek. but also mean to those who took the effort in the past
 eulerscheZahl: 3 per year?
 eulerscheZahl: what are you talking about?
 Astrobytes: It could be disabled and the achievement kept but that's too much work;
 eulerscheZahl: 3rd is escape?
 AntiSquid: they won't allow community contests ever again&#160;? that's a bit weird
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/z9ycrEz.png">https://i.imgur.com/z9ycrEz.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i can make a screenshot of the badge and put it next to my FC2020 participation
 AntiSquid: if someone comes up with an idea everyone likes then why excluide it
 Astrobytes: Were you not present for that particular discussion?
 struct: not impossible == impossible
 eulerscheZahl: apparently not
 struct: js returns true
 eulerscheZahl: thanks struct
 eulerscheZahl: i muted most discord channels so i missed it
 struct: np
 struct: its on sc21 channel
 reCurse: AntiSquid: because they want to focus on less big events
 AntiSquid: not much going on in there anyway (discord)
 reCurse: I mean less events, bigger events
 eulerscheZahl: i muted that one really quick
 reCurse: Having more community contests undermines the main ones
 reCurse: That's what I understood
 reCurse: From their logic
 eulerscheZahl: they gave me too much hopes on tryangle catch, i won't believe it without an official announcement
 AntiSquid: sure but pacman still broke records although it was right after OOC which was quite hard and a month long
 reCurse: Don't argue with me I'm just paraphrasing
 AntiSquid: no i am not arguing with you
 eulerscheZahl: but could have been more on PAC without OOC
 eulerscheZahl: (what they said)
 AntiSquid: just complaining out loud basically
 Astrobytes: Did you not see that whole discussion on discord AntiSquid? I'm sure you were in it somewhere.
 reCurse: I know just saying&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i saw it
 AntiSquid: i can't get over it lol
 Astrobytes: Fair
 Astrobytes: It's a daily struggle not to be overly salty publicly.
 Astrobytes: For me at least.
 reCurse: I took a 1-2 month break, it helped
 reCurse: Not saying you should but
 reCurse: Maybe?
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: i am not even trying astro :D
 eulerscheZahl: i went the reCurse way
 Astrobytes: I did take a couple of weeks out but not as much as you 2
 jacek: you curse them?
 Kingasasin177: Dangit I got #5 this time
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 AntiSquid: i am here for chat most of the time, not sure what you guys mean by time off anyway :D
 Astrobytes: Any participation
 Marchete: I went out of CG for months/years?
 Marchete: it's no big deal
 Marchete: just X and do other things
 Kingasasin177: Dang AntiSquid being #9th on the whole site
 AntiSquid: other places are in general less fun, aicrowd admins frowned at me for posting some funny AI related news, i mean seriously ...
 Astrobytes: You've been like a ghost up until recently Marchete :D
 Marchete: connected, saw the caht
 Marchete: chat
 Marchete: and logout :D
 Astrobytes: occasional one liner
 reCurse: The chat often makes me want to ragequit, if it was always like now it wouldn't be an issue as well :P
 Astrobytes: Yep.

 Astrobytes: should we kick him for that?
 AntiSquid: mods kick that guy
 Kingasasin177: Oh no
 Astrobytes: Thanks jacek :unamused:
 eulerscheZahl: that's a sign. good night
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 struct: gn
 jacek: did i scare him away?
 Marchete: 10:04 you are late
 AntiSquid: wow
 AntiSquid: he usually leaves earlier right&#160;?
 Marchete: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: it's just unusual

 jacek: i killed the chat&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: low quality troll
 MrFruit: What is a high quality troll&#160;:/
 Lucky30_: guys is the quest map bugy?? i have past the "reach the silver league in 2 games"
 Astrobytes: Lucky30_: It's a known issue, should be OK next day or 2
 Lucky30_: ok great
 Lucky30_: thx Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: you're welcome&#160;:)
 Kingasasin177: rip, I keep getting 15000, 400, and top 10 in Bronze league, it's literally a 50/50 at this point
 jacek: keep this up robo and karliso will be detronized :tada:
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 jacek: rebless favorite game
 Astrobytes: yeah I just checked UTTT, I clicked with the karliso mention eventually
 Astrobytes: I also didn't notice you were top 5
 DomiKo: jacekmax should be top1
 Astrobytes: ntuples again?
 jacek: not ntuples, just nn
 Astrobytes: Nice.
 Astrobytes: Suppose it doesn't really need ntuples now I think of it.
 Astrobytes: Nice work anyway
 jacek: thankies
 Astrobytes: One day I'll do that stupid game.
 Astrobytes: where in the lb was robo prior to his submit?
 jacek: 5th or 6th?
 RoboStac: 5th (if you don't count the cancelled submit in the middle that was good against karl but bad against rec)
 jacek: and there was bigger difference between top 2
 Astrobytes: Gotcha. And yeah I remember the gap
 Astrobytes: I won't jinx anything by commenting on the current submit
 GottaDoBetter: yall i cant even pass the first ai thing
 jacek: hm?
 GottaDoBetter: coders strike back. the race place with the 4 circles
 jacek: what league
 GottaDoBetter: uhhh i honestly have no idea how to figure out what league i even am. i literally just started on here 5 minutes ago
 GottaDoBetter: so very start
 cegprakash: check the variable name in the print statement
 cegprakash: it's wrong
 Astrobytes: Another 1 or 2 submits should do it RoboStac
 cegprakash: GottaDoBetter 
 RoboStac: do what?
 Astrobytes: Pull some of the others down
 RoboStac: nah, I'm negative winrate against the ones above me
 RoboStac: or equal
 Astrobytes: Ah, my bad
 cegprakash: or push urself with another version of ur bot :D 
 cegprakash: just kidding
 cegprakash: GottaDoBetter print nextCheckPointX and nextCheckPointY
 cegprakash: the variables are misspelt there
 cegprakash: so fix the spelling
 GottaDoBetter: ahhh i see what you meant. thank you!
 Astrobytes: ceg, come on dude. That's supposed to be a problem you have to solve.
 jacek: :thinking:
 cegprakash: no Astrobytes it's not fair to give a debugging challenge to a newcomer
 cegprakash: this site is about writing code not debugging in a tutorial
 Astrobytes: wtf is that logic
 CameronWatt: anyone know the best place to practice sql (for sql server prefered). 
 cegprakash: download mysqlworkbench and click the start server button and u can run queries there CameronWatt
 cegprakash: Astrobytes as I said it's my view
 cegprakash: I've seen ppl spend 3 hrs on that variable thing
 cegprakash: it's not worth it
 cegprakash: in my opinion
 Astrobytes: download SQL Server and set up a db, practice on it
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: I do understand you to a point, but I would argue that it's pretty damn useful to be able to spot a typo - especially as a newcomer
 cegprakash: just imagine u learn 3 hours to write a hello world program would u try that Astrobytes
 CameronWatt: thx all
 cegprakash: it's not the variable names are too large in c++ Astrobytes
 cegprakash: if it's X and Y then it's easily debuggable
 cegprakash: but how can u notice that X in checkPointX
 cegprakash: sorry nextCheckPointX
 cegprakash: such a huge variable name
 cegprakash: is this a treasure hunt
 cegprakash: or a coding tutorial
 cegprakash: there is a separate section for treasure hunt called code escape
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: nto being funny man, but as a kid I used to type out 2000 lines of BASIC into my Amstrad and then - syntax error on line 1567, and it's a GOTO statement.If new users can't handle an X vs a Y in a variable name then they have bigger problems coming if you ask me.
 Astrobytes: *not
 cegprakash: come on.. the idea of a tutorial is to make the sign up process simple
 Astrobytes: Onboarding.
 cegprakash: onboarding tutorial whatever
 Marchete: :popcorn:
 cegprakash: it's a hello world
 cegprakash: and taking 3 hrs is not fair
 cegprakash: several ppl quit just there
 Astrobytes: Sorry but the 3 hours (in my opinion) is on them.
 Astrobytes: And the quitting.
 cegprakash: not if the tutorial is made right
 cegprakash: and simple
 Marchete: onboarding-&gt;Hints-&gt;solution
 cegprakash: just click a button and the car moves hurrah how amazing does that look
 Astrobytes: It's *not* an intro to programming, it's there to catch you out
 cegprakash: instead the car drives like a drunk man and the user is not sure what is happening
 cegprakash: he doesn't even know what he had to do
 Astrobytes: CSB isn't the first thing. Onboarding puzzle is.
 cegprakash: previously there used to be a submit button now that is renamed to "Test in Arena" or something
 cegprakash: which I do not like as well
 cegprakash: But CSB is what I recommend to ppl
 Astrobytes: They don't *have* to do CSB but if they can't tell the difference between X and Y, like I said, they have bigger issues
 Astrobytes: Well complain to CG about the button, not me!
 Marchete: I agree with ceg, CSB is ugly for starters
 Marchete: they should do a new one, simplistic
 Marchete: for newcomers
 Uljahn: :notebook::soccer:
 jacek: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, sure, CSB shouldn't necessarily be the introductory tutorial - or should it? Different stroke for different folks.But correcting the mistake in the code is perfectly fine to me as part of an introductory tutorial.
 Westicles: The problem is a new guy here 5min shouldn't be doing CSB
 Westicles: But he seems happy, so it all worked out
 jacek: CG isnt good for complete beginner anyway
 Astrobytes: Indeed. I think the 'fix a variable name' problem highlights that.
 Astrobytes: lol Uljahn, is jacek paying you for that advertising?&#160;:)
 reCurse: I mean for the right price...
 Westicles: Oh god, 3D ASCII art now
 jacek: euler?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/ascii-cube">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/ascii-cube</a>
 tobk: Considering the ridiculously high participant numbers in CSB and absymally low numbers in other game, why have ONE "beginner" MP game at all? Promote different games at different weeks/months (like puzzle of the week, but MP only and more prominent).
 Astrobytes: We tried suggesting that.
 Astrobytes: At least community games get puzzle of the week sometimes.
 Westicles: 3D ASCII art with unicode characters!  How did the french let this happen?
 tobk: yes, but TBH I'd exclude those form the "beginners" rotation. But writing some tutorial popouts for the others should not be too much work. Particularly if it's only one each month.
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah I agree with that
 Astrobytes: Good luck making it happen
 tobk: What's particularly annoying about CSB is the complete re-write needed for Gold...
 Astrobytes: oh yeah.
 reCurse: Preaching to the choir
 tobk: (not _for_ gold, but _in_ gold)
 tobk: (or was it _for_ gold? can't remember, does not matter)
 Astrobytes: I can only echo reCurse here
 tobk: you mean reCurse is preaching to the choir that I am preaching to the choir?&#160;:-D
 Astrobytes: Dear oh dear :door:
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: wp
 Astrobytes: Pedantry has it's merits :D
 Astrobytes: *its
 tobk: so much for pedantry&#160;:-P
 Astrobytes: No one ever said pedantry doesn't apply to ones own statements&#160;;)
 tobk: one's?
 tobk: SCNR
 jacek: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: lmao
 Astrobytes: I've outdone myself this evening
 tobk: yeah, I'm off, too. see you.
 Astrobytes: Didn't say I was going anywhere, just acknowledging my mega-fails :D
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Astrobytes: See ya later anyway
 ZarthaxX: see you astro
 Astrobytes: wot
 tobk: (misread outdone as overdone)
 ZarthaxX: gn astro
 Astrobytes: HELLO ZARTHAXX
 ZarthaxX: Good morning Astro
 ZarthaxX: how are you doing today
 Astrobytes: I am fine ZarthaxX. Thank you for asking. How are you doing today?
 ZarthaxX: Im doing fine kind sir
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: had my last interview and im tired
 Astrobytes: ah nice. Good one?
 ZarthaxX: yes
 ZarthaxX: mix of grupal group and invididual
 ZarthaxX: individual
 Astrobytes: The interview process was?
 Edrrum: heyooo
 Edrrum: i'm new and wanna start coding
 Edrrum: what activities do you advice me to try
 ZarthaxX: this one was 
 Edrrum:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Cool. Very modern approach.
 Astrobytes: Edrrum: can you code at all?
 Edrrum: ye a bit
 Edrrum: javascript
 Edrrum: HTML 
 Edrrum: CSS 
 Edrrum: and a lil bit python
 Astrobytes: Stop at JS and python.Familiar with loops, conditional statements etc? Data types, basic data structures?
 Edrrum: ye loops and conditional statements
 Edrrum: but data structure still not
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a> try thor or temperatures
 Astrobytes: Easy puzzle section, try the ones without an author (the official CG puzzles)
 Edrrum: ow okay
 Edrrum: thanks ^^
 jacek: or the descent
 Astrobytes: Anything you don't know, look it up in your favourite search engine
 jacek: bing?
 Astrobytes: Or language documentation
 Edrrum: ow i see 
 Edrrum: thanks again i will do that ^^
 Astrobytes: And try to solve stuff on paper if you get stuck, before writing your solution.
 Westicles: ZarthaxX, did your gf ever make those dice for euler?
 ZarthaxX: no
 ZarthaxX: she is busy with other models
 ZarthaxX: i told her tho
 ZarthaxX: she was doing it in between other things
 Westicles: Ah, looks like it got released so he found some
 Astrobytes: Other models eh
 ZarthaxX: oh nice
 jacek: eh?
 ThePoisoned1: can i post here a pastebin of a problem idk why one test case doesnt work to see if someoen can help me out figure why?
 ThePoisoned1: or is that not allowed
 ZarthaxX: its ok
 Astrobytes: ^

 ThePoisoned1: im gettign a wrong output on the 6th test
 ThePoisoned1: i did this this way because the normal way with que and stuff times out
 ThePoisoned1: queue
 Astrobytes: You can do everything in one loop iirc
 Astrobytes: Testcase 6 is large dataset so it's about being efficient
 ThePoisoned1: i mean i do get an output
 ThePoisoned1: so mi code should be efficient enough
 ThePoisoned1: but its just wrong somewhere
 Westicles: Are you overrunning an int somewhere?
 Astrobytes: ^
 ThePoisoned1: u mean like passing the int limit?
 Westicles: yeah, earnings is long but maybe some other variable?
 Smelty: ole spring challenge is a game now
 ThePoisoned1: doesnt look like
 ThePoisoned1: i mean the problem gives you those values as imputs
 ThePoisoned1: the number of posible combinations in teh cart is 173 or soemthing
 Astrobytes: Java makes my head hurt.
 Smelty: lol
 codeing: @Smelty
 Smelty:  ?
 codeing: sorry, java seem like cool
 Astrobytes: Fix the code for ThePoisoned1, Smelty
 codeing: Astrobytes
 Smelty: uh....
 Smelty: ok?soooooo
 KelvinAndHubbles: Haven't done a lot of bot programming outside Spring challenge, UTTT, and Tron, are there any good ones to get into?
 struct: There are plenty
 Kingasasin177: I'm in Bronze League in Coders Strike Back and it's pretty much a 3/97 to get a good score now regardless of what you do
 Smelty: hmm
 iggy12345: Muahahaha I finished The labyrinth
 iggy12345: finally
 iggy12345: ugh
 iggy12345: I thought dijkstra's algorithm was easy
 Smelty: hm
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3505c4b-af3d-4b3a-b10c-67f0535e6ef1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3505c4b-af3d-4b3a-b10c-67f0535e6ef1</a>
 Smelty: interesting
 iggy12345: what is that for?
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 iggy12345: hewoo
 Wontonimo: hey iggy12345, what are you up to?
 iggy12345: nm, watching southpark and working on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/aneo">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/aneo</a>
 Wontonimo: oh yeah, i did that one.
 Wontonimo: I vaguely remember it
 Wontonimo: 34 lines of python
 Wontonimo: what lang are you using?
 iggy12345: python
 Wontonimo: good luck
 iggy12345: thanks fam
 iggy12345: what are you up to?
 Wontonimo: about to take my dog on a walk
 iggy12345: sounds like fun
 iggy12345: it's raining down here, otherwise I'd take my dog for a walk too lol
 Wontonimo: you did pretty good on Coders Strikes Back
 iggy12345: oh that's the one that I got the code from the forum lol
 iggy12345: got me all the way to gold lol
 iggy12345: I just wanted to see if it worked and it just kept winning
 Wontonimo: looks like your current bot is dying
 iggy12345: probably, I'm currently trying to get silver in another puzzle
 Wontonimo: which one?
 Wontonimo: you have silver in hypersonic.  i haven't tried that one
 struct: I want to try it soon
 iggy12345: oh, I'm in bronze in hypersonic
 iggy12345: had me confused for a sec
 iggy12345: It's really fun
 struct: you can store the board on uint128_t despite it being 13*11
 Wontonimo: oh right bronze
 struct: Dont ask me how, I dont know...
 iggy12345: lol
 Wontonimo: do you just ignore some squares?
 iggy12345: probably, that's how I did it in othello
 Wontonimo: i mean, you dn't need to store the non-playable squares
 struct: I think they ignore the squares that are impossible
 struct: which are 5*6
 struct: Yeah, I understand that you can ignore
 struct: but dont know how it works
 struct: I havent tried a lot though
 DomiKo: any questions?
 Wontonimo: i have no idea either 
 Wontonimo: no questions from me
 DomiKo: I could help I guess
 struct: Well, im a beginner on bitboards
 DomiKo: yes you can store board on 128bits
 Wontonimo: hey DomiKo!  I don't think i've ever chatted.  Nice to meet you
 struct: I dont understand how you can ignore cells that also have an impact on the game
 DomiKo: they have impact?
 DomiKo: Wontonimo hi hi
 struct: Dont they block bombs explosions?
 DomiKo: they do but it's much simpler
 iggy12345: well, if the cells have &lt;2^n states, then you can use less than n bits
 DomiKo: you have to look at x&#160;% 2 and y&#160;% 2
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: but isn't all the unpacking and packing not worth the 2 extra bytes?
 DomiKo: one mask is much better than two 
 iggy12345: the packing and unpacking only takes a few cycles
 iggy12345: and the storage efficiency often outweighs the cost
 DomiKo: in hypersonic you can do a bit more complex stuff and do explode action using bitboards too
 Wontonimo: right, where as the extra memory fetch takes 10-20 cycles
 iggy12345: the memory fetch can take anywhere up to a few thousand cycles?
 iggy12345: depending on where it's at
 struct: ok im not gonna pretend I understood :p
 Wontonimo: i still can't imagine an efficient unpacking bittwiddle
 DomiKo: when bomb is in even row (I don't remember) then you don't need to explode bomb horizontaly
 DomiKo: because you have box on left and right
 ZarthaxX: nice
 struct: How do people find this?
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: just when it gets interesting i've gotta go.  Hey DomiKo, nice to meet you.  Hope to see you around in the next few weeks
 iggy12345: find what?
 iggy12345: cya wontonimo
 struct: I had to use paint for SC21
 DomiKo: if you ping me I will be there I guess :sweat_smile:
 ZarthaxX: struct pros
 DomiKo: cya
 struct: cya wontonimo
 ZarthaxX: bai Wontonimo
 struct: maybe when i get more invested on hs ill ask you some questions
 DomiKo: :nerd:
 iggy12345: I debate whether or not I should push to try and get my spring challenge into silver, or my hypersonic into silver
 struct: did you also use beam domiko?
 struct: on hs
 DomiKo: yeah
 DomiKo: but I would say that HS beam is the most interesting beam
 DomiKo: that I know
 struct: why?
 struct: You dont have to answer if you dont want to
 iggy12345: what is beam?
 struct: beam search iggy12345
 DomiKo: it's very tricky
 struct: its a bfs but you do some pruning
 struct: ah ok
 DomiKo: diversity is the key
 iggy12345: hmm, I'll have to look into that more
 iggy12345: never heard of it
 ian12: hallo
 struct: hi
 ZarthaxX: ohhh igot to top 100 magically
 ZarthaxX: wohooo
 iggy12345: random question, in the aneo sponsored puzzle, do the lights have 2 states, or 3?
 TheMapotakes: H&lt;
 struct: grats ZarthaxX
 struct: ill catch you next contest
 ZarthaxX: you are top 200 struct!
 ZarthaxX: nice&#160;:)
 struct: thanks
 struct: I have very bad contest rating
 ZarthaxX: next contest wont make you catch me i think
 ZarthaxX: you would need to do multis
 ZarthaxX: mm
 ZarthaxX: same&#160;:/
 struct: i only have points from last 2 contests
 struct: The others I didnt try at all
 ZarthaxX: euler has 200k points and got 1st :O
 ZarthaxX: ah then maybe struct
 struct: nice
 DomiKo: 200K :open_mouth:
 struct: you have 52k points on bot programming?
 struct: what are you playing
 ZarthaxX: im full of points from multis that were contests
 ZarthaxX: the ones i did
 struct: np
 ZarthaxX: havent done many multis outside contests i played
 ZarthaxX: np?
 struct: no problem
 ZarthaxX: but why did you answer that? lol
 struct: no problem ill catch you
 ZarthaxX: ahhh
 ZarthaxX: not if i do multis too&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: just kidding pass me
 struct: nah im doing other stuff now
 ZarthaxX: like?
 struct: stc
 ZarthaxX: AGAIN?!
 struct: I never finished it
 struct: I opened my ide today and read the code
 ZarthaxX: premature optim is strong on you sir
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: good luck to me 
 struct: I dont undertand it anymore
 ZarthaxX: good luck sir o/
 ZarthaxX: HAHAHAA
 struct: I even reused states
 struct:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: thats good
 struct: its not worth
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e37ac05-6813-432d-a836-8fac032d33ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e37ac05-6813-432d-a836-8fac032d33ae</a>
 struct: I compute all possible states until depth 4
 struct: for me and opp
 struct: I can reuse 11155 at most on the next turn
 struct: ah it goes further
 struct: it doesnt stop at depth 4
 struct: so it can actually reuse more states
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: you dont even remember your code
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 micoze-stella: I completely forgot about the contest (I didn't log in at all during the period).It's hard to share my impressions 'cause I dont have account of 
 shaima_ab: hi
 micoze-stella: hi... im loser lol
 CameronWatt: hi... im fat lol
 iggy12345: I tell bad jokes because I'm a bad joke
 OBenjOne: how much does the ranking mean on this site?
 aresous: @OBenjOne it means everything
 aresous: jk xd
 OBenjOne: Is is a good estimate of how good a coder you are?
 OBenjOne: Haha
 aresous: absolutely not. it is a very broad subject. I've noticed on this site it is heavily math oriented. on codewars I have a 10x easier time.
 aresous: also, it depends, what particular field you're interested in
 davilla: really? I thought CodeWars was more math oriented
 davilla: I did Mars lander without any math, not even distance formula, other than deltas in either x or y.
 davilla: certainly no trig
 aresous: this is from the perspective of someone whose highest math is algebra 2 and physics 1 lol
 aresous: I have solved many problems into the deeper end of codewars ranks and I'm struggling with the very first few questions on this site because of the math. 
 aresous: I have a much easier time mapping arrays/objects and traversing strings than I do with very simple mathematical operations
 OBenjOne: I haven't really used a ton of math here either, the most math I've used on this site was making a collision prediction program for coders strike back
 OBenjOne: Just some simple 2D physics
 davilla: Luckily nearly everything is tagged. Does that help you see what you're getting into?
 aresous: yeah none of it even says it's math heavy, I seriously think I'm just an ape. then again my max kyu completed on codewars is 4 so idk
 aresous: this site could just be exponentially harder than codewars
 aresous: or I just really suck at math l m a o
 davilla: That's not too shabby. My coworkers didn't reach that.
 aresous: that gives me hope to find a job in web dev, thanks for sharing davilla lol
 aresous: i think im just going to have to go on khan academy or some other free learning website and retake maths all the way up to at least calc
 davilla: Couldn't hurt. I always felt I didn't understand calculus. After graduating I went thru that class again, thinking I might teach it one day. (What else would you do with a math degree?) There's a lot of detail that you have to grind thru again, but it's a lot less intimidating the second time around.
 OBenjOne: I have not taken calc yet, and none o the puzzles I have tried have been too difficult (on the math side at least)  I have struggled with some programming things like BFS 
 davilla: To be sharp as CS you should know logarithms.
 aresous: haha, yeah I just did not enjoy digesting the math curriculum at my highschool as I didn't think I'd use any of it. I was wrong.  what field are you in btw davilla?
 davilla: at* CS = comp sci
 aresous: like, title at work?
 aresous: cause you said your coworkers never hit 4 kyu so im curious
 davilla: By CS I mean the degree. My coworkers were all pretty sharp, so I don't know why they didn't rise higher. Maybe I just wanted it more than they did. I wasn't a programmer by job title.
 davilla: Mathematician, slot machines.
 aresous: ahh okay, cool. well thanks for sharing
 Battikhah: whta are things that i should learn before entering comp sci classes? 
 Skynse: Which python version does codingame run
 Skynse: like 3.*
 Chainman: I actually don't know.  I haven't tried walrus operator in it yet.
 Skynse: It's nice to be able to clash again
 Chainman: I know it has f strings, so 3.6+
 Skynse: Haven't clashed in almost 3 months
 Skynse: School work
 Chainman: I just discovered C++ has tuples :nerd:
 MoMaT: Skynse: see this for versions -&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Skynse: Thanks

 Wontonimo: yeah, i get it
 xxd: perfect for people like me ._.
 xxd: honestly i dont have fun while coding it up, the fun and dopamine only comes when it finally works
 xxd: its like super polarizing
 xxd: actually, i get dopamine from imagining it working in my head
 Westicles: I thought you kids get dopamine these days from huffing your grandma's prescriptions
 xxd: thats rookie stuff. 
 Westicles: oh nvm, I was mixing it up with serotonin
 Wontonimo: that's a great insight xxd about the dopamine from imagining it working.  There is a great study about that.
 LinhT.Nguyen: zhong wen shui ping bu cuo
 Westicles: wing ding ding-a-ling
 xxd: bruh
 Wontonimo: english only here
 Wontonimo: there are other non-english channels
 ChickenCoder123: hey what u guys do here now
 ChickenCoder123: which are the best challenges
 Wontonimo: Try the Mars Lander series
 Wontonimo: if you haven't
 xxd:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: (turn off your volume)
 xxd: yeah, mute the ab
 xxd: tab*
 Westicles: just curious, why the obsession with mars lander and csb?
 ChickenCoder123: ill try that
 ChickenCoder123: after this insanely confusing coc that i just got
 Wontonimo: they are fun for beginners
 Wontonimo: nice graphincs
 ChickenCoder123: ic
 xxd: as a beginner i do not condone that statement
 Wontonimo: haha
 ChickenCoder123: can u guys help with my coc
 ChickenCoder123: its about water levels
 xxd: its active right now? no
 Wontonimo: you didn't find Mars 1 fun xxd?
 xxd: mars 1 doesnt count. and i spent longer than i should've solving it
 xxd: kept running out of fuel :facepalm:
 ChickenCoder123: how do i get to the mars lander thingy
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 Westicles: I would think young programmers would prefer algorithms over physics problems
 Wontonimo: it can also be solved as a control problem
 xxd: i agree with westicles
 Wontonimo: using PID
 Wontonimo: oh&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: i didn't know kids these days are so abstracted from the physical world
 xxd: lol
 Wontonimo: okay then, solve this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/network-cabling">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/network-cabling</a>
 Wontonimo: route some cable to low rent houses
 xxd: thats a cool one
 ChickenCoder123: it doesnt seem too hard
 xxd: or this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/next-growing-number">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/next-growing-number</a>
 Wontonimo: or this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-resistance">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-resistance</a>
 xxd: lol
 xxd: i had to solve that one in C++ since python timed out
 Wontonimo: i did it in python
 xxd: wow
 ChickenCoder123: im mars lander does rotation of +-15 degrees happen instantly?
 xxd: did you use a trie?
 Wontonimo: let me time it ... just a sec
 Wontonimo: 0.063 seconds to complete "Long sequence, large dictionary"
 xxd: darn
 xxd: do you use string slicing?
 xxd: or a trie
 xxd: (or hash?)
 Wontonimo: no.  i build a large lookup of combinations so far
 xxd: not sure what you mean by that
 xxd: well, the good news is naive string slicing is fast enough in C++ 
 xxd: so i sorta cheesed the problem
 ChickenCoder123: doesnt it just mean combinations of height and speed that output thrust?
 Wontonimo: for mars lander 1?  yes
 ChickenCoder123: hey how do i output something in like another output stream, because if i output something in standard output stream it takes that as control for my rover
 Westicles: use the error stream
 ChickenCoder123: how
 Westicles: it says in the default code
 ChickenCoder123: oh ok
 ChickenCoder123: for mars lander if power could be a float then, after speed reaches like 30 or something you could just set power to 3.711 lmao:joy:
 xxd: :flushed:
 ChickenCoder123: is there a second part to the mars landing?
 ChickenCoder123: becos it said that there were three levels
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander-episode-2">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander-episode-2</a>
 ChickenCoder123: thanks
 xxd: its a lot harder
 xxd: but YMMV
 Wontonimo: don't shoot for solving all test cases quickly.  if you just solve 1, feel accomplished&#160;!
 ProCoder03: it took me 2 days to just solve the first one&#160;!!
 eggeggwe: lol, me too.
 Wontonimo: Here is a physics based solution (not PID) for the first one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/575819757">https://www.codingame.com/replay/575819757</a>
 ProCoder03: the horrible part is, it took me 11 or 12 if elses  
 ProCoder03: PS: I didn't use PIDs
 ProCoder03: why is optimization so difficult :crying:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: optimization of what?
 ProCoder03: the optimization quest map 
 Wontonimo: which one are you on?
 ProCoder03: the 3rd one , some code of rings  
 ProCoder03: wait idk anything abt brainf**k 
 Wontonimo: i kinda feel like my solution to Ring of Codes is a big cheesy
 Wontonimo: *bit
 ProCoder03: Mayan Calc is like ASCII art right??? 
 ProCoder03: and one more what is 'Radix'&#160;???
 Wontonimo: for Code of the rings, i calculate the cost of changing every rune to the letter that is needed and then greedily pick the one with the least cost.  That's it really.
 ProCoder03: ohh!!!!
 Wontonimo: it is dumb tbh, because it just ends up cycling between 2 runes usually
 Wontonimo: a beam search would be way better
 Wontonimo: i guess it is a beam search of width 1
 Wontonimo: :P
 Wontonimo: the Mayan Calc is a little more than ascii art
 ProCoder03: Well what is a beam search&#160;??:sweat_smile:
 Wontonimo: do you know what a BFS is?
 Wontonimo: or DFS  ?
 ProCoder03: nahh.. I am just started learning trees 
 Wontonimo: ok.  Check this out <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1H3jAAGlEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1H3jAAGlEA</a>
 ProCoder03: thanks&#160;!!!
 xxd: I watched that guys videos for GA and minimax
 xxd: RIP
 ProCoder03: wait do I need trees to understand search&#160;??
 KamadoTanjiro: hi
 xxd: trees?
 KNTK: Graphs probably
 xxd: as in the data structure of a tree?
 Wontonimo: yes, once you get into the weeds of it, you'll need trees
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 ProCoder03: ohhhh....
 xxd: Oh no, Code of the rings is a necessary quest checkpoint?
 xxd: why are they making us do certain problems
 xxd: this is pain
 Wontonimo: who is making you?
 RightHandElf: dopamine
 RightHandElf: I should start playing cookie clicker again
 Wontonimo: wow, a lot of people online suddenly.  did school just start somewhere?
 xxd: it's 7:44 for people in france, it seems
 ProCoder03: Ig Codingame is fast becoming a place where students are there instead of school 
 ProCoder03: including me&#160;!!
 ProCoder03: @xxd are you in high school&#160;??
 Westicles: xxd is a professor emeritus at caltech
 ProCoder03: wow&#160;!!!
 ProCoder03: just got confused because bcoz his profile said some school
 Westicles: oh, well not really :P
 xxd: westicles is trolling
 derjack: good morning
 EvilBrocolli_1bf6: good morning
 TheOneCode: Why isn't it possbile to end up my code optionaly (without ranking of course)
 Uljahn: because entering a clash means you agreed to compete
 BryanNativel: yo
 TheOneCode: yeah the Code until 15minutes should go for the rank, but if you are not lead the code to the end  that you can optional complete it, so that that code doesnt go to rank-system...
 Uljahn: just submit it and go ahead, clash rank is a lie
 derjack: life is a lie

 Dev-Wings: Hello good people. I have been invited to take a technical assessment for an entry developer(front end development) on this platform.If there's any heads-up you would want me to know before taking this test please let me know.
 TobiasA: i don't have any but goodluck
 martinpapa69: if you are first time here on this site solving some easy puzzles first might help you to get used to the platform
 FBF_Luis: hi dev-wings. I also found this because of a technical assessment for a company. The only thing I remember from the test is that it has nothing to do with the puzzles presented here
 mtagizadee: Hey everyone. How is it going?
 FBF_Luis: not great xD
 FBF_Luis: can't figure out what is wrong with my c++ code
 Totototo34twgrettgw: C++ is probably what is wrong
 Totototo34twgrettgw: :p
 Dev-Wings: Appreciated.I must admit this was a lot to absorb and overwhelming at first considering the amount puzzles but I get the idea.Thanks again good people for the feedback.
 michaellan: C++ is gr8
 FBF_Luis: I bet it is, but it is not beginner friendly at all
 xxd: are you getting error messages?
 FBF_Luis: yes, my last 20 minutes were just googling error messages
 FBF_Luis: I'm getting there slowly (I think)
 sheaaaaaaaaa: if you start with the hardest then everything else will be easier
 xxd: googling error messages is a good skill to have
 FBF_Luis: I started with python, but next month I'll start working for a company that asks for c++
 FBF_Luis: they know I'm a beginner but still chose me, so I'm doing my best until then&#160;:)
 xxd: congrats man
 sheaaaaaaaaa: congrats
 FBF_Luis: thanks ^^
 PybH: good luck
 FBF_Luis: thank you
 Luzon: are ya winnin son
 KalamariKing: :0
 KalamariKing: WOW my coc rank fell from 200 something to 1805
 beepbooping: nice
 hungryboi: hi
 xxd: lol, doesnt matter TBH
 xxd: I'm super close to getting mars lander working, in theory. Just have to write the fitness function 
 TobiasA: aay kalamari 
 KalamariKing: ayy someone remembers me
 BlaiseEbuth: No. He's just polite.
 KalamariKing: oh hey blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: Who are you&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 KalamariKing: idk
 KalamariKing: who am i
 TobiasA: bet you don't remember me
 KalamariKing: I do
 KalamariKing: I remember quite a few of you
 TobiasA: good 
 andrefpoliveira: Hey. Im finishing MARS LANDER - EPISODE 1 with 309l but I cant get the achievement. Is this normal?
 TobiasA: did you submit?
 andrefpoliveira: yeah
 TobiasA: try and submit again
 andrefpoliveira: i did 4 times xD
 TobiasA: damn
 BlaiseEbuth: 309l is from IDE's tests&#160;?
 andrefpoliveira: yeah. Can I see the results from the submission?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't remember, but you probably don't do so well on validators
 andrefpoliveira: I thought it was the same test
 andrefpoliveira: Well, will try to get a better result on the IDE
 BlaiseEbuth: You can see your validators result
 BlaiseEbuth: Click on 'details' in the 'results' tab
 andrefpoliveira: Oh on the validator i get 294. Ok thanks!
 xxd: oof.
 xxd: what strategy are you using? andrefpoliveira 
 andrefpoliveira: Ahah its not a good one xD
 andrefpoliveira: Just checking height
 BlaiseEbuth: "don't crash"
 andrefpoliveira: basically yeah
 xxd: O _ O
 andrefpoliveira: The good: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ba8c543-7dc6-447a-a678-b41d555df895">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ba8c543-7dc6-447a-a678-b41d555df895</a>
 andrefpoliveira: xD
 xxd: hmmm :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: You probably get better result using speed instead of y
 xxd: yeah. check if v_speed &lt; -35 or something
 andrefpoliveira: Yeah true
 xxd: man im so close to solving ML i can feel it flowing thru my veins
 xxd: i think my GA might be too slow tho
 Darius_504: how do i fix de angle in wood 2
 BlaiseEbuth: ml2 or 3?
 Darius_504: 3
 xxd: wood 2?
 Darius_504: yeah
 xxd: since when was there leagues
 AllYourTrees: whats ML?
 xxd: mars lander
 AllYourTrees: oooh
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, you know, the wood2 league of THE unique multiplayer game of the site
 BlaiseEbuth: xxd ml2 or ml3
 xxd: all of them...?
 xxd: my GA should technically work for all situations
 xxd: just might not converge corretly on things like cave, wrong side
 BlaiseEbuth: Even cave? Good.
 xxd: technically*
 xxd: in theory
 xxd: i'm probably still a week from getting it
 TobiasA: oh oh what about the replay can i see 
 xxd: im running all the tests locally on my computer right now
 xxd: no replays to share, yet
 TobiasA: oh 
 TobiasA: when you get it i would really like to see the replay
 BlaiseEbuth: I only made a lazy solution for ml2 that can't work on ml3. ^^
 BlaiseEbuth: One I'll do it seriously...
 xxd: i think the annoying part to tweak will be the evaluation/fitness scoring function
 BlaiseEbuth: In any search algorithm depending on a 
 eulerscheZahl: just take the fuel consumption?
 BlaiseEbuth: *an evaluation function
 eulerscheZahl: fuel works fine when you can ensure that you find a valid path
 eggeggwe: I spent a day solving a easy puzzle, and I finally did it :D
 BlaiseEbuth: gg
 xxd: grats
 xxd: which one?
 BlaiseEbuth: onboarding :3
 eggeggwe: temperature, I am new here.
 eggeggwe: it's time to solve more puzzles :3
 BlaiseEbuth:  Go go go eggeggwe!
 dmin: im going to be honest, I can't solve temperature 
 dmin: i think i just cant understand the prompt lol 
 dmin: kinda embarrassing 
 BlaiseEbuth: What don't you understand?
 TobiasA: aayy i'm not the only one who is bad at easy things
 TobiasA: and is also embarrased about it
 eggeggwe: that's not a big deal, I can't in the beginning, either. I spent 2 hours to understand what should I do.ww
 BlaiseEbuth: No need to be.
 Wontonimo: hey, welcome eggeggwe
 Wontonimo: hello regulars :wave:
 eggeggwe: thanks for welcome me. :D
 TobiasA: hi wontonimo
 eggeggwe: hello to you, too. wontonimo
 michaellan: hi wontonimo&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: hey xxd!  I was going to ask you what fitness function you are thinking of using?  Probably *don't crash* is a good one
 gilufin: how can I find my clash chat if i close it?
 Wontonimo: it's gone dude
 gilufin: bug
 Wontonimo: gone for good, lost in the void 
 gilufin: not if I open from the alert when the clash is over
 michaellan: you can use browser history
 michaellan: oh wait nevermind, misread
 michaellan: anyway, i'm over clashes now
 gilufin: reload the page and it's back
 michaellan: Wontonimo: I'm having trouble writing the distance metric
 michaellan: i wanted to do the distance-along-the-surface but its much harder than i thought it to be
 Wontonimo: did you try the flood fill thing I mentioned?
 michaellan: right now i'm just taking (index of crash surface - index of landing surface) * some constant
 michaellan: wouldnt that be slow?
 michaellan: like 7k by 3k map
 Wontonimo: you only have to calculate it once at startup where you have 1 sec anyway
 TobiasA: wait what
 michaellan: I think if I'm using GA, I'm supposed to get the answer in the very first second and then just print out the moves for the rest of the game...
 michaellan: maybe thats wrong
 Wontonimo: and you make it 4x4 or 10x10 granularity
 TobiasA: you can use flood fill in mars lander?:hushed:
 michaellan: ah of course
 michaellan: what is it with me and not being able to register the fact i can downscale things
 Wontonimo: and if the flood fill increments, then you have a distance field from the landing pad
 michaellan: yup
 michaellan: my visuaslizer is nice though
 michaellan: which comforts me
 TobiasA: you have a visualizer:0
 TobiasA: fancy
 ninjadip: huh
 michaellan: its super extensible
 michaellan: i wrote it for CvZ
 TobiasA: damn
 TobiasA: you are really good at coding
 michaellan: it crashed my browser when i tried uploading 670k frames though
 TobiasA: what language did you use?
 michaellan: JS
 TobiasA: sheesh
 eggeggwe: well....How I save my program?
 Wontonimo: ctrl-c ctrl-v
 michaellan: ctrl-c alt-tab ctrl-v
 Wontonimo: if it is a multi (bot battle) or a challenge
 eulerscheZahl: alt-tab?
 Wontonimo: then it saves every time you submit 
 michaellan: alt tab to go back to text editor
 Wontonimo: and for multis if you send to arena it also saves every version in your history (left hand side)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's usually ALT+2 for me. VS Code on virtual desktop #2
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/33627748-627d-44ae-bd44-6956d539679b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/33627748-627d-44ae-bd44-6956d539679b</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ example of mars flood fill
 Wontonimo: with increment
 eggeggwe: OK,so if I submit my program,I still can continue coding it next I open the program?
 michaellan: damn
 michaellan: why does that pastebin look so... satisfying to look at
 michaellan: do you use a BFS?
 michaellan: how do you get all the starting poitns
 Wontonimo: no, flood fill
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 michaellan: because the input is in the form of lines
 TobiasA: wait how does that even work
 Wontonimo: you look for the horizontal line
 eggeggwe: oh wait. I got it. Thanks everyone. :D
 Wontonimo: you already know how to calculate the landing pad
 Wontonimo: what do you mean TobiasA?
 TobiasA: last time i checked the height of the mars lander screen was larger than 12
 michaellan: i think he chunked them into like 50x50-pixel blocks
 michaellan: cuz it doesnt have to be super precise
 TobiasA: oh makes sense
 TobiasA: but damn that looks clean
 michaellan: when you're floodfilling, do you have to cehck for collisions?
 michaellan: with the lines
 Wontonimo: i wasn't going to paste a 4x4 pixel version ... just too bug
 Wontonimo: *big
 michaellan: i guess the floodfill is better than distance-along-surface cuz you can get the distance metric even if you dont land in time
 Wontonimo: for collision with lines, I used a polygon calculation.  I added 3 lines to the surface, left, right, and bottom, such that the surface is a closed polygon
 Wontonimo: then there are calculators to check if a point is inside the polygon
 <b>**michaellan is not smart enough to understand wontonimo</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: another method is to walk along the terrain lines, and fill the grid with -1 (or watever you are using to mean crash) before the flood fill
 Wontonimo: if you want a border of safety, then when you are walking along the terrain lines, don't just fill that square, but also fill the squares nearby
 michaellan: how do you walk along the terrain lines though
 TobiasA: bet it has to do with slope
 michaellan: hmm
 michaellan: OH
 michaellan: you walk from one x to the next x value
 TobiasA: not sure
 michaellan: and then use the slope
 michaellan: to get the approximate y value
 TobiasA: yea that's what i was guessing
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: hey could i have some friends?
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: here is my escape room link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/LMZ-W7m-TvW-jha">https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/LMZ-W7m-TvW-jha</a>
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's one way to do it xxd
 Wontonimo: you have to consider the case of vertical lines, in which case walk the y axis
 michaellan: ah
 oxydowe: hi, is it possible to prevent font resize in editor panel?
 michaellan: wait, theres only gonna be one horizontal line
 michaellan: so i think i should just walk y
 Wontonimo: and instead of walking 1 x at a time, you cam walk in increments of your grid size
 michaellan: this is so complciated
 Wontonimo: for best results you want to walk x or y depending on which one has the least slope
 Wontonimo: so that you don't skip squares
 michaellan: It's *sorta* working <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/CQABa3F">https://imgur.com/a/CQABa3F</a>
 michaellan: not really
 michaellan: i think its my fitness function thats jank
 michaellan: i'm worried bc i cant run that many iterations
 Wontonimo: nice.  mine really improved when i calculated early crash conditions, for example
 michaellan: what does that mean
 Wontonimo: if 1500 units above the landing pad I know that the lander is descending so fast that it would crash no matter what, then i count it as crashing in the air where it currently is
 Wontonimo: doesn't have to be 1500 units, whatever 
 michaellan: oh interesting
 michaellan: would have never thought of that optimization
 Wontonimo: otherwise you spend a lot of time searching unrecoverable crashes
 michaellan: i'm not sure whether i should store my thrust and angle as floats or ints
 michaellan: yeah true
 Wontonimo: trying to turn sideways or speed up
 beepbooping: anyone know how a ruby library with the #!ruby thing
 beepbooping: how to import a
 michaellan: are you in a shortest-mode clash right now?
 beepbooping: no
 michaellan: the sad part is i'm probably still really far from solving ML
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: oh ok
 Wontonimo: calling it ML is really confusing.  I keep thinking your are talking about Machine Learning. 
 TobiasA: me too:joy:
 MSmits: what does he mean by ML then?
 Wontonimo: Mars Lander 2 &amp; 3
 MSmits: ohhh ok
 Wontonimo: using GA
 MSmits: yeah don't call it ML on this chat. Half the time we talk about machine learning here&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: maybe ML3 or ML23
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: hey Wontonimo, I got confirmation today my oware endgame book is correct!
 Wontonimo: oh!  How did you do that?
 jacek: by whom
 MSmits: I submitted a normal (non ML) bot using the meta mcts generated book  that uses the endgame book. It got 3-2 vs robo on submit
 MSmits: and thats because it explores the best paths first
 MSmits: aka, Robo's
 MSmits: i dont win &gt;50% though, because my bot is weaker on 36 seeds and lower
 Wontonimo: why is that?
 MSmits: but the fact that it wins and predicts 18 of Robo's moves tells me it's correct
 MSmits: because it doesnt have hardcoded moves in the &lt;= 36 region
 Wontonimo: ah.  is robos a NN&#160;?
 MSmits: it's the nr 1 NN, far better than the rest
 MSmits: btw, just to be clear, i used no outside information. this is just bruteforce and meta mcts selfplay
 MSmits: no counterbooking or some such, the program has no capability for it
 Wontonimo: did you submit it?
 MSmits: yeah, it's still 10th
 MSmits: because it sucks vs weaker players (meta mcts didn't go there)
 Wontonimo: ah
 MSmits: i am just using this to test if the endgame book is correct though, it's a complicated process to generate it. I was worried about bugs
 Wontonimo: my son tells me that fencing is like that.  Train too much with the pros and noobs can take you out super easy.
 MSmits: well i dont mean actual weak players. I just mean the other NN's :P
 MSmits: my bot wrecks all non-NN's
 Astrobytes: I only resubmitted oware 'cause martinpapa69 keeps spamming submits and pulling me down :P
 martinpapa69: weaklings
 Wontonimo: yeah, i know.  i wasn't saying everyone else is a noob in Oware
 MSmits: Marchete has brought forth a legion of bots that beat me&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nice that it's working MSmits
 Wontonimo: excellent, team effort of making you have to adapt
 Wontonimo: gotta learn new tricks
 MSmits: yeah, I have been putting off working on the NN part. I have no more excuses to put it off now
 Astrobytes: Work?
 MSmits: another week off&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Ah right, my bad
 Wontonimo: I thought you had a backyard
 Wontonimo: that needed fence posts and stuff
 Astrobytes: that was ages ago :D
 MSmits: sure, but i have these two big green bins that get emptied every 2 weeks and i fill them in like 1 day
 MSmits: so i cant do this all week
 MSmits: i cut down some bushes, mow some grass and that's it
 MSmits: backyard slowly coming into shape though
 Astrobytes: nice
 Wontonimo: just gather it into big pile in the middle of the road and burn it.  easy peasy 
 MSmits: yeah, don't think the neighbors will appreciate&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i have that same problem
 Wontonimo: another way to train a NN is to have a child
 Wontonimo: and if it's blond, it will be an ANN
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: artificial blonde&#160;?
 Wontonimo: Artificial NN
 Wontonimo: okay, not my best joke
 <b>**Astrobytes sends a taco </b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: (that's me catching it)
 Astrobytes: I know it ain't Tuesday but whatever&#160;:)
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: you don't know about tuesday Jacek?

 MSmits: it's tuesday in Australia Wontonimo. Just talk to an Australian here on chat while you eat it. That covers it
 Astrobytes: lol, awesome Wontonimo

 Wontonimo: no thanks
 michaellan: i want to take a break from Mars Lander but on the other hand i don't think i'm too far
 michaellan: one question that I keep having is, I have some metric where a higher value is worse, but I want to convert it into a metric where a higher value is better
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: im not good at coding yet im bad at the clash of code
 michaellan: aka distance -&gt; fitness score
 michaellan: i'm not sure what I should use to convert it
 michaellan: subtract the original value from a large constant?
 michaellan: that's what i'm currently doing but I don't know if it's any good
 TobiasA: you can do 1/distance maybe
 michaellan: ah true, i didnt think of that
 Wontonimo: you can optimize to lower a value
 Wontonimo: or to raise a value
 michaellan: true but like
 michaellan: fuel: more = better; distance more = worse
 Wontonimo: used fuel = worse
 michaellan: damn smart
 Wontonimo: used full + distance = bad
 michaellan: I'm gonna probably re-write my mars lander GA from scratch
 michaellan: there's just so much cognitive things to keep track of
 TobiasA: i feel your struggle
 TobiasA: :pray:
 michaellan: :pray:
 michaellan: i'm using a really suspicious method of finding intersections
 michaellan: that i found on Stack overflow
 michaellan: using counterclockwise checks
 michaellan: WHAT?? Di_masta only needed 400 generations to converge
 michaellan: bruh... I am not converging on solution after 10k :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: also depends on the population size
 eulerscheZahl: that counterclockwise test for crossings is pretty common

 eulerscheZahl: oh, lastweektonight has an IT topic this time
 TobiasA: what's lastweektonight?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqD-ATqw3js">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqD-ATqw3js</a>
 eulerscheZahl: they have a new topic every week and talk about it for 20-25 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: recent issues that are sometimes not even that well known
 TobiasA: oooh it looks interesting
 michaellan: I'm not getting enough dopamine from solving Mars lander, gonna try some other stuff
 michaellan: for LoCM, I keep seeing something called ClosestAI/ClosetAI, I'm not sure what that is/where to find it
 michaellan: it apparently has the best draft strategy
 michaellan: i'm guessing thats a higher-league bot?
 eulerscheZahl: closet won the contest
 eulerscheZahl: would be first in the multiplayer too but never submitted
 TobiasA:  "I might as well be a faster idiot":joy:
 TobiasA: i like that guy
 TobiasA: what is LoCM?
 Scarfield: Legends of Code and Magic
 reCurse: Locm had significant changes in the multi so it's not clear the contest results are 1:1 /shrug
 eulerscheZahl: oh right. i totally forgot about those
 eulerscheZahl: just patched my bot so it wouldn't crash and called it a day
 michaellan: I didnt see anybody called closet on the leaderboard
 reCurse: He didn't submit in multi

 michaellan: i'm looking at the contest leaderboard though
 eulerscheZahl: sprint or marathon leaderboard?
 michaellan: oh.... what's the difference?
 Scarfield: did he share more than his ranking of the cards?
 eulerscheZahl: wrote a post mortem
 Scarfield: ok kewl

 eulerscheZahl: he's still occasionally active on the CG discord
 Scarfield: i actually looked at my python code for LoCaM, one of the first multies i tried, damn its ugly xD
 eulerscheZahl: the game doesn't deserve a nice bot code
 michaellan: D:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm biased. i just hated the game
 michaellan: luck?
 eulerscheZahl: might have been better in a shorter format. doesn't have the strategic depth to keep us busy for long
 eulerscheZahl: you end up fighting over tiny differences. and RNG in draft =&gt; gameplay order has a heavy impact
 Scarfield: i played some Magic back in the day, so i liked the idea of coding something playing a card game, but yea others have been saying the same as you
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, good night
 Scarfield: :wave:
 Benji-the-scripter: Hi im new
 Benji-the-scripter: cant code so good
 Benji-the-scripter: actually a noob at coding
 Scarfield: hi new, im dad
 Benji-the-scripter: lol
 Scarfield: how new though, this site kind of assumes you know the very basics. you know for loops and the like=
 Geiler: What should I do if I can't solve a challenge? I can't look at other people's solution because they most likely use a language I don't know
 Scarfield: you cant see others solution before you have solved it yourself, but ask a specific question and you might get an answer
 Scarfield: chat seems to have been a bit slow lately, so dont expect too much help&#160;:/
 Geiler: Alright thanks
 Scarfield: what challenge are you having trouble with?&#160;:)
 Geiler: Right now I'm not having trouble with anything, last time I couldn't solve the "Inverse a square matrix" problem
 Benji-the-scripter: i cant code =(
 Geiler: I have looked up code on google but I hate reading other people's code
 Geiler: They don't use my style, name their variables single letters
 Benji-the-scripter: im noob
 Benji-the-scripter: call me noob
 Scarfield: i dont know the "inverse a square matrix" problem, nothing named that here(?) but there are plenty others to choose from&#160;:)
 Benji-the-scripter: i have coding problems =(
 Geiler: Alr, thx tho
 michaellan: benji why dont you get to work learning how to code
 michaellan: do you write lua for roblox or something?
 michaellan: thats the only demographic i know who call themselves "scripters"
 Astrobytes: If you're having code problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems and my scripts ain't one
 Scarfield: JayZstrobytes xD
 Astrobytes: Scarfoncé :D
 Scarfield: LOL
 Scarfield: put a ring on it
 Astrobytes: I can't see your halo
 Scarfield: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: lol, I got nothin'
 Scarfield: i have a big problem.. cant decide which multi to go for after C4
 Astrobytes: I've been optimising some of my optims
 Scarfield: ooh
 Scarfield: i didnt even implement the idea i gave domi ko for marslander myself
 Astrobytes: wasn't that quite some time ago?
 Scarfield: yup
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: There you go
 Scarfield: xD something else caught my attention
 Astrobytes: Which is...
 Scarfield: not a bad idea, its a nice optim
 Astrobytes: *was
 Scarfield: the idea?
 Astrobytes: No, what distracted you originally
 Scarfield: not sure, i have bounced around the multies
 Scarfield: mars lander was my first GA, so probably CvZ
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I went in on FB after that Spaghetti contest and got legend, then couldn't decide on a multi so went optim
 Maxim251: Hurra D I did achieve mentor ranking :D I am so happy :D
 Astrobytes: well done Maxim251!
 Scarfield: im not like smits, i am quickly hapy enough with my bot, and move on
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Astrobytes: I need to get back to breakthrough at some point, 20th or something there. But I need to do all the official CG multis
 Scarfield: oh FB is not a bad choice either, only submitted some super basic stuff
 Astrobytes: My bot is fairly basic, just a reflex bot
 Scarfield: yea i still have plenty to even start&#160;:)
 Scarfield: uuu and pcr, i need to make and todo list
 Astrobytes: I misplaced mine lol
 Astrobytes: Should make another I guess
 Scarfield: sad times&#160;:(
 Scarfield: chess, i forgot about chess
 Astrobytes: Arf, yes, I still have to start that
 Scarfield: its by far the largest bot i have written so far, and didnt even implement castling or en passant
 martinpapa69: codinga chess sim :sleeping:
 Scarfield: ye
 Astrobytes: It's somewhat 'involved'
 Scarfield: i made a local version that you can play against with the console, i want it to be able to beat my friend some day
 Astrobytes: nice
 Scarfield: yea its fun, untill he castles xD
 Astrobytes: lol
 Maxim251: I have question, I am plaing now A*Craft, do I need use tree search?  Or use hard coded choices to cgeck which direction will give more points?
 Astrobytes: Something like flat Monte Carlo to start with, then simulated annealing or some kind of hill-climbing I think
 Astrobytes: You can run those offline to get optimal solutions and then hardcode
 Astrobytes: Or just do it online
 Maxim251: second question is about game information,  message " 2 8 is a void cell.15 5 is a void cell.17 8 is a void cell. "
 Maxim251: that are empty space, then why I have information about that?
 Astrobytes: because some maps have empty spaces in them
 Astrobytes: So you kinda need to know that so you don't just walk off into space
 Maxim251: O my gosh, Never mind, I know why is printing that
 Maxim251: Is my fold. Because to know what is happenning on game and check rulles in game I did hard coded moves, now I change test case, and map is different, but hard coded moves stays... And game is printing that I try make move on empty space :X
 Maxim251: Sorry... :flushed:
 Maxim251: To day, thinking is not going so well for me :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that won't work&#160;:)
 Scarfield: gonna call it a night, cya&#160;:)
 michaellan: gn
 ADamYuan: LEBRON
 Astrobytes: gn Scarfield
 ADamYuan: how do i level up
 AllYourTrees: kill a bunch of slimes
 michaellan: wow... apparently ClosetAI's draft strategy was dominating
 michaellan: did he release it anywhere or must I, too, go download 14GB of his replays :P
 michaellan: ah he has a list
 michaellan: maybe this list is enough to get me into silver
 ADamYuan: do ppl cheat in this
 michaellan: in what
 ADamYuan: clash of code
 ADamYuan: cus some ppl are finishing before i read the question
 michaellan: thats like asking do people shoplift the dust on the store shelves
 michaellan: yeah thats probably because they are good at scanning the important parts of the input
 Swyfti: how do you cheat in clash of code though? contributions are put into codingame daily
 Swyfti: its really hard to cheat in coc
 michaellan: i think you can write a bot to search up the corresponding contribution and grab the solution code
 Swyfti: thats what clash of code bots do lol
 TobiasA: i can tell swyfti is speaking from experience
 michaellan: mhm
 Swyfti: they grab a random solution from the past, and slams it wheither its correct or not
 michaellan: oh i meant
 michaellan: the actual contribution page
 Rob022: use bot code to hax any computer in the world
 Swyfti: l love it when the bots submit like 1000+ character solutions in shortest mode and still get it right
 michaellan: so theres a 100% chance of it being correct, at least not in shortest mode
 michaellan: i'm gonna see if ClosetAI's draft carries me into the next league
 Swyfti: good luck
 michaellan: i wish there were no items in the game
 MSmits: why?
 MSmits: with a good algorithm you can pretty much calculate all possible ways to play cards, almost every turn
 MSmits: so it's not really limiting you in that way. 
 michaellan: hmm
 MSmits: but of course it requires a lot more coding
 MSmits: I think my bot outputs the calculation time it uses.
 ADamYuan: can someone spot the pattern for me input: 3 7 20 output: 1 input:  17 2 1651 output: 34input: 4 3 5 output:2 input: 1000000000 1000000000 1000000007 output: 49
 michaellan: bruh
 michaellan: do your own work
 Wontonimo: input 3 numbers , output 3 numbers
 Wontonimo: oh , no
 Wontonimo: sorry
 Wontonimo: the patter is 
 Wontonimo: input 3 numbers, output 1 number&#160;!
 Wontonimo: there you go!
 ADamYuan: nice man
 Wontonimo: no problem!
 michaellan: i actually already found it but i wont tell you
 ADamYuan: k
 Wontonimo: that's just mean xxd
 michaellan: the second case gives it away
 michaellan: first and second
 Wontonimo: give the person a forgiveness taco
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539894159">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539894159</a> xxd
 MSmits: me: is my turn. en: is enemy turn
 <b>**michaellan gives ADamYuan a kid-size taco</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: a sim is a sequence of actions, and it says how much calculation time is used
 MSmits: in milliseconds
 Wontonimo: that works, it wasn't that mean so i approve the size :D
 michaellan: the screen is black for me
 michaellan: nvm
 BlaiseEbuth: You have a problem with black screens?
 MSmits: the trick to searching the space of possible actions is to either use hashing, or to do it like me, which is to say limit the order in which you do things
 michaellan: MSmits: do you have N enemy playouts for each of your playouts?
 michaellan: are you using minimax or MC
 MSmits: it's a sort of minimax, but it's only my turn and then his turn, so depth 2 i guess
 MSmits: i assume he has no cards
 MSmits: so just his creature attacks
 ADamYuan: ok thanks i see it now
 michaellan: does minimax have to consider every permutation of actions?
 michaellan: yup understood that part
 MSmits: yes, but here's the thing
 MSmits: dont search equivalent series of actions
 michaellan: how are you only running &lt;10 sims
 MSmits: because most series of actions are equivalent
 michaellan: ah
 michaellan: so hash? i read that eulerscheZahl said he hashed
 MSmits: if you attack creature A with B and C, then  it doesnt matter if you attack first with B or first with C
 MSmits: yes, you can hash, that works fine
 MSmits: i didnt know how to hash back then
 michaellan: but you cant do something like sort right?
 michaellan: wow you've come a long way then
 MSmits: yeah
 michaellan: since things like breakthrough should attack last
 MSmits: exactly yes
 michaellan: oh nvm 
 michaellan: i think thats a bit easier than hashing
 MSmits: i just have an inordinate amount of rules to do things in order
 MSmits: many many rules
 michaellan: DS:
 michaellan: D:
 MSmits: and exceptions
 MSmits: I think maybe i have a PM of this, sec
 michaellan: i think the line for me is still fuzzy between minimax and monte carlo sim here
 michaellan: are you doing any sort of random playouts for your own side, or only for opponent, or neither?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/legends-of-code-magic-cc05-feedback-strategies/50996/18">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/legends-of-code-magic-cc05-feedback-strategies/50996/18</a>
 MSmits: read this first. And if you want, any of the other pms
 MSmits: i have most of my ordering rules in there
 michaellan: thank you
 michaellan: whats a pm
 MSmits: post mortem
 MSmits: summary of your work during contest
 MSmits: people who do well are kind of expected to do it and many people also just like to share
 michaellan: gotcha. i've read thru a bunch already, but they mostly just raved about closetAI draft :D
 MSmits: yeah, I stole it by hand 
 MSmits: took 4 hrs
 MSmits: I just made custom games with only 2 different cards in them and checked which ones he preferred
 MSmits: something like that anyways
 MSmits: then euler had an automated program to mine it from replays
 MSmits: or some such
 xxd: mhm, i think kovi also did that too
 MSmits: btw, if you're confused by the bit stuff in my pm, ignore that. I had just discovered bitboards and went a little overboard with it
 xxd: hmm, you mention "Since they always remove ward (with 1 exception)"
 xxd: this doesn't seem to be the case...? did the cardpool change?
 MSmits: let me see the context
 xxd: heres a bit more copy pasted: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/caa82953-2210-484c-8811-63033c5f8e07">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/caa82953-2210-484c-8811-63033c5f8e07</a>
 reCurse: fwiw he's still overboard with it :P
 xxd: we were talking about how you used tritboards on something yesterday
 MSmits: reCurse ok ok, I am *less* overboard with it now
 MSmits: tritboards on uttt yeah, to have smaller lookup arrays
 MSmits: not particularly helpful, but was a fun excercise
 MSmits: i still have a little bit of tritboards in my bot i think
 xxd: your search is super duper complex
 Swyfti: what is a tritboard?
 MSmits: instead of 0 and 1 as options, you have 0 and 1 and 2
 Swyfti: oh that is useful
 MSmits: also expensive to calculate with
 Swyfti: i can see why
 MSmits: basically you can do a TTT board like this:
 xxd: "When I thought of this trick, my required simcount became roughly 20x smaller and calculation time mostly rounded down to 0 ms."
 xxd: hah, nice
 MSmits: every square can be 0 or 1 or 2
 MSmits: 0 = empty
 MSmits: so you do board = 0 * 3^0 + 2 * 3^1 + 1* 3^2
 Swyfti: that is some calculations right there
 xxd: in my current bot i have so many lines of code that try to kill guard enemies with lethal before spamming face
 Swyfti: in legends of code and magic?
 xxd: do you think i should try MC or go with minimax
 MSmits: mc works fine
 xxd: this minimax tree and ordering actions seems so complicated
 MSmits: euler did mc, his bot was almost equal to mine, he had some bad luck on the final recalc
 xxd: ouch
 xxd: "My bot uses a minimax, where the moves are generated randomly instead of doing a full search."
 xxd: thats... MC right
 Swyfti: import java.util.random;
 MSmits: yeah but i guess keeping the best result somehow qualifies as it being minimax? I dunno what that was about
 MSmits: you can do a staggered mc 
 MSmits: keeping the best result in every step
 MSmits: not really minimax though
 xxd: how/when do you evaluate board state
 xxd: do you randomly playout along the way
 MSmits: i dont 
 MSmits: mine is full search
 xxd: oh i meant
 xxd: in a staggered MC
 xxd: sorry
 reCurse: MC Stagger
 MSmits: oh, i guess if you do it staggered, you evaluate right before choosing what to keep
 xxd: I'm sorta on my honeymoon with MC/MCTS right now
 xxd: ha
 MSmits: i am not really that experienced with MC
 xxd: okay, so you dont run like N sims on each child
 xxd: o
 MSmits: I only ever used it once
 xxd: darn
 xxd: for what?
 MSmits: zombies
 MSmits: before I hardcoded it 
 xxd: same! i used MC for that
 xxd: ._.
 Swyfti: monto carlo tree search?
 MSmits: no just monte carlo
 MSmits: no tree
 Swyfti: no tree
 Swyfti: ahhh
 MSmits: it's one of the easiest search
 xxd: i was wondering if i should also try CvZ with GA
 MSmits: but also usually inferior to something else
 Swyfti: easier than BFS and DFS?
 xxd: apparently euler has never written a GA on codingame
 xxd: inferior to what
 xxd: something in particular?
 MSmits: Swyfti similar
 MSmits: depends on the domain
 xxd: ah
 MSmits: in uttt, mcts is superior
 xxd: in the case of CvZ, what would be superior
 MSmits: ga is definitely better than plain mc if you do it right
 xxd: ooo
 xxd: i am just learning GA so i maybe will try it on CvZ
 xxd: i have already written simulation etc
 MSmits: i never used GA. I tried some SA though
 xxd: writing an evaluation/fitness function scares to no end
 xxd: scares me*
 xxd: ah
 MSmits: SA seems cleaner
 MSmits: simpler
 MSmits: and often works just as well
 xxd: thats what i thought too
 MSmits: less hyperparams
 xxd: but westicles told me its often slower than GA
 reCurse: GArbage
 xxd: cant argue with that logic
 AllYourTrees: MSmits this is unrelated, but do you know of any ways to do MCTS solver where you prune solved nodes but without biasing the q values?
 reCurse: Isn't pruning a systematic bias
 xxd: you dont remove them
 xxd: thats what i read in a apaper
 xxd: the solver paper talks about it
 AllYourTrees: yeah but i feel like theres something better than what they talk about
 AllYourTrees: i feel as if you should be able to not visit solved nodes but still backup their outcomes somehow
 Westicles: slow is only an issue with 50ms problems, not offline optims
 reCurse: From my experience it doesn't seem necessary at all for win and loss since they are arguably infinity
 reCurse: Draws however are still a mystery to me
 Wontonimo: why does the evaluation/fitness function scare you so much?
 Wontonimo: ^^ xxd
 xxd: maybe because i've had bad experiences trying to write such functions for LoCM and mars lander
 MSmits: AllYourTrees are you just talking about draws?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/IioPYd1">https://imgur.com/a/IioPYd1</a>
 AllYourTrees: well im working on C4 so yes draws, but i kinda feel like it would apply without? like shouldn't a node with 5 proven losses be worse than a node with 3 proven losses (i guess depending on values of other nodes)
 MSmits: so if you look at my picture, only backpropagate results from nodes with an average value &gt; 0
 reCurse: You already backpropped 5 losses over 3 losses
 reCurse: So the bias should already be there
 MSmits: no you backpropagate all
 MSmits: not just losses or wins
 AllYourTrees: but if you're pruning then won't the values of unpruned nodes overwhelm those after a while?
 reCurse: Well the loss is very unlikely to picked again
 reCurse: And the win terminates the node
 reCurse: So it shouldn't really matter
 reCurse: Draw is where it's icky
 MSmits: my way works because generally we're talking about bad nodes right? With &lt; 0 value
 michaellan: :q!
 MSmits: you can keep exploring those, without harming the parent value
 AllYourTrees: hmm yeah looking at your pic now
 michaellan: oops ignore that
 MSmits: it will get closer to 0 only
 MSmits: because you're backpropping 0
 MSmits: until somehow the bad node becomes good
 AllYourTrees: are you backpropping max value among siblings?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: just either the result, or the 0
 MSmits: depending on the average node value of the selected child
 MSmits: and only when there's a solved draw sibling
 MSmits: so this is an exception
 MSmits: a *fix* to reduce the bias
 reCurse: I don't understand your pic
 xxd: im dumb do you mind giving more context to someone new to solver
 MSmits: let me put it into words then
 MSmits: there's a parent
 MSmits: it has a solved child
 MSmits: and x unsolved nodes
 MSmits: some of them are bad
 MSmits: if they are bad (&lt; 0 value) their sim results are not backpropped
 MSmits: but 0 is
 MSmits: if they are good nodes, backprop happens as normal
 MSmits: including losses
 MSmits: so it's not that it only backprops wins or something
 reCurse: I'm becoming so scared of uct behavior over time I have no idea how it's going to react
 AllYourTrees: lol
 reCurse: Every 'smart' mod I did to it resulted in tragedy
 MSmits: yeah uct does some whacky stuff
 MSmits: anyway, from everything i came up with, this made the most sense to me
 MSmits: however, i play no games where this bias even visibly affects my results
 reCurse: That's the issue for me, sense is the enemy
 michaellan: whats the difference between win/loss and positive/negative value
 MSmits: a win or loss is the result of a simulated game in basic mcts
 MSmits: an average value is total wins - losses divided by visits
 reCurse: The only sense I can make out of it empirically is the same as for solving a game
 reCurse: You generally are in the right direction if the number of possibilities decrease
 reCurse: UCT sort of does that through average however infuriating the concept is
 MSmits: ah right, but that's not even always true. In some games with long narow branches, this performs very poorly
 reCurse: In theory
 MSmits: i saw this in yavalath
 reCurse: In practice it still works better than if you try to account for it
 reCurse: Either that or I'm stupid
 reCurse: Which is very possible
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: yeah most things i try to fix this made it worse also
 MSmits: could be because you're easily overcompensating 
 reCurse: I've plotted mcts behavior and it's very maddening
 MSmits: and creating new problems
 MSmits: yes, it fluctuates between good and bad moves
 MSmits: eventually converging on the good move
 MSmits: but more visits may sometimes make it worse
 MSmits: this is also true for minimax sometimes. More depth can cause you to pick a worse move
 reCurse: No minimax is 100x more sensed
 MSmits: but in mcts it's worse I think
 MSmits: sure, it's easier to grasp it
 MSmits: i agree
 MSmits: i mean why it works
 reCurse: I keep trying to untangle the concepts of mcts to improve them more easily and it fails
 MSmits: you can reason about it
 MSmits: same
 reCurse: I would like to be able to explore nodes without fucking up the expected value
 reCurse: But I can't
 reCurse: I don't even understand how the expected value should behave
 reCurse: It still makes zero sense to me that a 40k visits node can have average -0.05 below what it should be
 reCurse: When 97% of its visits are on one child that has a better average
 reCurse: And 3% have terrible evals
 reCurse: You *should* be able to get rid of the 3%
 reCurse: But nope, you can't
 reCurse: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AllYourTrees: sounds like you've had some frustrating experiences with MCTS lol
 reCurse: It's about as opaque as uttt
 reCurse: So they're a match made in heaven
 reCurse: It's more about how I read dozens of papers, did dozens of tweaks/improvements and almost all of them resulted in worse or equal performance
 Swyfti: is it worth learning mcts?
 BlaiseEbuth: No. Just copy/paste it.
 MSmits: no, i know exactly what you mean. I stared at meta mcts a lot, which is basically mcts happening 10000x slower. So i see this a lot
 Swyfti: i dont even know what it is
 Swyfti: how can i copy paste it
 Swyfti: its like trying to find something when you dont even know what you are trying to find
 BlaiseEbuth: Just copy paste a full solution, don't look what's inside.
 BlaiseEbuth: You perhaps already copied a MCTS.
 AllYourTrees: from codingame import mctsmcts.play()
 reCurse: Can we try not shitting up the chat when there's a good conversation going for once
 AllYourTrees: recurse have you tried implementing something that you think would make things worse?&#160;:)
 reCurse: Hah, I did actually
 reCurse: Getting desperate
 AllYourTrees: lol
 reCurse: So at this point AllYourTrees I'd say just go empirically
 AllYourTrees: how many bugs do you think mcts researchers have in their code they use for papers?
 reCurse: It's scary actually
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 reCurse: Funny you mention that
 MSmits: reCurse I think maybe you're expecting more from mcts that what it can give you. You're intuition tells you it should be better, but intuition and stuff related to probability is very poorly matched
 reCurse: I was looking at a paper a few days ago
 reCurse: Oh, code on github
 reCurse: Good, helps me understand something I wasn't clear about
 reCurse: And... oh there's a major bug in the exploration part
 reCurse: Like no sqrt
 reCurse: ...
 AllYourTrees: lmao
 reCurse: Whole paper is based on those experiments
 MSmits: lol...
 MSmits: maybe thats why they dont often share the code used
 reCurse: That's why I often only use it for inspiration without really caring for results
 JBM: sharing code is bad for your academic career
 AllYourTrees: are you sure the original UCT authors meant to put in the sqrt? maybe they accidentally left it in there
 reCurse: But for mcts it's been mostly a failure
 reCurse: Apart for maybe a few minor things
 reCurse: MSmits I really really want to have something closer to thompson sampling work
 MSmits: The only enhancements to mcts I use are the solver, rolling out multiple children at once or not using rollouts at all
 reCurse: And get rid of UCT for once
 reCurse: But no luck so far
 MSmits: well I'm glad you tried thomsen sampling, so i dont have to
 AllYourTrees: are there "things" other than minimax/alphabeta and mcts? i only know those two main ones
 reCurse: I didn't try thompson sampling itself
 reCurse: I tried stuff close enough to it
 MSmits: ahh ok
 reCurse: The idea being to rely on observations to build a more reliable probability distribution
 reCurse: And use that to have a more reliable Q
 MSmits: AllYourTrees those things you mentioned are umbrellas
 reCurse: But it's not working
 MSmits: there are many versions of minimax/ab
 MSmits: negascout
 MSmits: and such
 reCurse: It seems to be like gradient descent as in it requires a 'noisy' part to work better
 MSmits: reCurse did you try them on equal number of iterations instead of calc time?
 MSmits: in that case you may at least see the improvement
 AllYourTrees: did you unit test your code?
 AllYourTrees:&#160;:)
 MSmits: from what i noticed with mcts "improvements" is that the performance hit usually kills the gain
 reCurse: It's all tied together
 MSmits: but if you try it with equal number of iterations you can at least see that it works in principle
 reCurse: Assuming equal number of iterations gives better result
 AllYourTrees: is there some higher level algorithm that mcts/minimax are some specific version of?
 reCurse: Where do I go from there
 reCurse: It's like saying a bigger NN on equal iterations works better
 reCurse: Great.
 MSmits: you could try to optimize. If it doesn't even give better results, you can throw the idea away
 reCurse: I usually implement in a way that I'm not going to magically be able to 2x it after
 MSmits: well, if you're going to try a bunch of variations on uct that give you small improvements, it helps to at least initially eliminate the performance part. 
 AllYourTrees: have you tried just deleting your code and creating your own algorithm from scratch? half joking/half serious
 AllYourTrees: (thinking back to what msmits said about mcts not able to give you more)
 reCurse: I don't see the point
 MSmits: this area has been researched to death so if you do find an actual improvement it is a big find
 AllYourTrees: isnt it the same point of trying all the little changes?
 reCurse: The point of trying all these changes is sort of to go outside of mcts but not inventing something completely new either
 reCurse: Because I really don't have more intuition than that
 reCurse: I just think the assessment of Q and U would make more sense by building a probability distribution and updating it
 reCurse: Instead of averaging a bunch of bad choices
 reCurse: That's the basis of thompson sampling as I understand it
 reCurse: That way exploring a bad node has almost zero impact on the policy
 MSmits: also... doesn't it make more sense to use more advanced things than basic uct when it's not a bottleneck. I would expect some serious gain there while using a NN
 MSmits: i mean obviously with a million random rollouts in uttt, any improvement is going to give a serious slowdown, but it shouldn't in your case
 reCurse: Not really true
 reCurse: I use small networks
 MSmits: oh
 reCurse: In hopes of gaining better search
 MSmits: how many rollouts compared to a non-NN version? x 0.25&#160;?
 reCurse: I have no idea how I'm supposed to answer that
 MSmits: i mean, say you replaced with a simple eval
 reCurse: Right now my chess bot has 85% of thinking time on NN eval
 reCurse: Roughly
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: yeah then i guess selection can still eat some
 MSmits: especially with high branching
 reCurse: When you start doing slightly complicated stuff in selection or backprop it shows
 MSmits: in a game like oware, it should not matter
 reCurse: 30% drop in nodes can be pretty bad so you need pretty good compensation
 MSmits: so few moves, selection is super cheap
 reCurse: That's what happened when I got fancy with distributions
 MSmits: I see
 reCurse: Well not 30% more like 50%
 reCurse: Anyway
 reCurse: Maybe it's better but I couldn't see hope in optimizing it enough
 AllYourTrees: with a NN its not really searhc anymore is it? its correcting for the lack of accuracy/training in the NN? not sure if theres a valuable difference between the two
 reCurse: NN is very noisy
 MSmits: you average out the poor evals
 AllYourTrees: like if you train enough/with enough accuracy the search part shouldn't change the policy?
 MSmits: some NN evals are bad
 reCurse: That's a very idealistic vision
 AllYourTrees:&#160;:)
 reCurse: Imagine a complicated tactical position in chess
 reCurse: It would basically have to compute all the tactical variations in the NN to compensate
 reCurse: It's extremely difficult
 reCurse: But pair it with a simple search to see through the basic results
 reCurse: And suddenly it's better
 AllYourTrees: still though, with a NN (or some policy) you're just trying to search for something that proves your current policy wrong?
 MSmits: it's also going to encounter boards that are somewhat rare in training
 reCurse: The NN is better seen as intuition
 MSmits: board-types
 reCurse: Like 'this should be better'
 reCurse: To guide the search
 reCurse: Then the search confirms or denies it
 AllYourTrees: only confirms on terminal nodes since its using its own value though right?
 reCurse: No, UCT confirms it
 reCurse: Maybe the root eval is good
 reCurse: But search sees you lose a queen in 3
 reCurse: Oh, not so good
 reCurse: It's unrealistic to expect the NN to see all the possibilities, it just develops a feel for what's good and what's not
 AllYourTrees: so it just needs to learn to approximate, and then also how to guide the search such that its error is correct with the search
 AllYourTrees: corrected&amp;
 AllYourTrees: *
 reCurse: That's for training yeah
 reCurse: But it won't be perfect so inherently noisy
 reCurse: I'm still rather amazed it works in minimax with nnue to be honest
 reCurse: Minimax shouldn't be a good match for noisy values
 AllYourTrees: yeah i still vote for you trying things that sound good if you think about them for 1 s, but any further thoughts make them seem not good
 AllYourTrees: aka uct, nnue + minimax
 AllYourTrees: :upside_down:
 reCurse: Well trying stuff didn't work so great
 reCurse: I mean the baseline is pretty solid
 reCurse: Just trying to improve it further when it blunders&#160;:/
 michaellan: i'm by no means familiar with NN, but is it hard to understand because the process is a black box?
 MSmits: not exactly
 MSmits: it's just obscure why the NN makes the decision it does
 MSmits: but the process is very understandable
 reCurse: At this point I find mcts more obscure than nn tbh
 michaellan: i see
 michaellan: lol, goodness gracious
 MSmits: it's like how a biologer understands every part of a cell, but can't build it out of separate parts
 reCurse: And this goes all the way back before nn with uttt
 Swyfti: programming can be used anywhere
 michaellan: huh
 Swyfti: okay what forget what i said
 michaellan: if there were some hierarchy of AI approaches, would NN be near the top?
 michaellan: i feel like the top people often use NNs
 reCurse: Use the right tool for the job
 Swyfti: "and don't cheat if you want to be respected" - anonymous
 michaellan: what cant NN do?
 reCurse: Multiply two numbers
 TobiasA: damn
 michaellan: would NN for LoCM for example not make sense?
 MSmits: NN is not a full solution usually. There's usually a lot of components that are also used when a NN is not part of the solution
 MSmits: like we're talking about mcts now for a while, which you can do with a NN or without it
 michaellan: oh i see
 michaellan: sorry if i'm asking dumb questions
 MSmits: it's not a dumb question
 michaellan: i'm just too tired to code so i'm just listening to your convo
 reCurse: Still in the top 5% of this chat
 MSmits: NN is usually most of the work and it's a pretty new thing in the field of AI, or at least it got big recently
 MSmits: &lt;10 yrs i think?
 MSmits: mcts is about 20 yrs and minimax is much much older
 michaellan: oh wow
 reCurse: Deep learning has a lot of hype so it obviously receives a lot of attention
 reCurse: Doesn't mean it's always the best tool
 michaellan: i used a NN library once for data science, but i suppose the process looks very different for bot programming and such
 AllYourTrees: they've been around for decades, but the compute (and data) has blown up and made them accessible/usable
 MSmits: doesnt have to be very different xxd
 MSmits: depends on how you use it
 MSmits: what i am trying to do with it now is probably very close to it being used in data science
 michaellan: after you're done with your offline training, do you have some array like "const weights=[3234,6,26,642,462,...]" or something just squeezed together as tight as possible?
 MSmits: if you're doing azero, then yeah, very different
 michaellan: *when you submit to CG
 AllYourTrees: yep pretty much
 MSmits: xxd yeah, for code size reasons usually compressed into a long meaningless string or something
 MSmits: or it's sent as a binary
 MSmits: 㚟㖖޹ഥ⹍㲶䄸䆸䉦䆳ㆃᾐ䄤䆬䉦㤪䈽⊮ㄬ䈤୳ਠ䆀
 michaellan: cool, thanks
 MSmits: start of my oware opening book :P
 michaellan: lol, nice
 TobiasA: that's binary?
 michaellan: unicode i think?
 MSmits: it's my way of turning moves into unicode yeah
 MSmits: I put 5 moves in 1 character
 michaellan: darn
 TobiasA: eh i think my brain is stalling
 TobiasA: why does unicode look like chinese
 michaellan: I wish more of the top people would stream so we could see their workflows
 michaellan: or like make videos
 TobiasA: exactly
 michaellan: but i suppose they would be giving away secrets
 reCurse: Because mandarin has the most characters
 AllYourTrees: have you seen cg zero?
 TobiasA: nope
 MSmits: for oware it's easy, you have 6 moves and i have 1 possible "move" that just says go up the tree 
 AllYourTrees: marchete open sourced code to train alpha zero
 MSmits: so 7 possible moves
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 MSmits: a* 7^0 + b*7^1 + c*7^2 .... e * 7^4  
 MSmits: has a maximum of 16807
 MSmits: fits in unicode range
 reCurse: Completely useless knowledge outside CG
 MSmits: yep
 AllYourTrees: not so sure
 TobiasA: how do you guys convert to unicode?
 AllYourTrees: could be useful for embedded stuff
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: let me check TobiasA
 reCurse: Encoding it this way actually occupies more bytes
 reCurse: Counting characters is more of a java thing to do
 michaellan: lol
 AllYourTrees: turn float into 4 bytes, use base65536 to turn 4 bytes into unicode
 reCurse: No, try it and count the bytes
 AllYourTrees: oh right cause CG does the weird counting thing
 MSmits: TobiasA in this case i originally had a string of numbers of 0 to 5 for oware moves and '}'for going up the tree.
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/22e3d7a5-c1f4-44e9-9e9f-d245fa8599db">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/22e3d7a5-c1f4-44e9-9e9f-d245fa8599db</a>
 reCurse: bbl
 MSmits: this is in C#, me converting to unicode
 MSmits: i decode it back to normal in my c++ bot
 michaellan: code golf finally coming in useful?
 TobiasA: so that function returns the string in mandarin?
 michaellan: are you at the point where you need to golf the submitted code
 MSmits: TobiasA yes
 MSmits: it turns 01345}123}431 etc. to that Mandarin thingy
 TobiasA: hmmm that's something i can use to impress my little sister
 MSmits: shrinking it by a factor of 5
 michaellan: the mandarin? TobiasA 
 TobiasA: she would go crazy if she sees that:joy:
 MSmits: in some bots I somehow get a lot of emotes in the encoded string
 MSmits: like a beach chair, or sun
 MSmits: or beer
 michaellan: yeah my brother recently showed me a encryption strategy he thought of where he rotates the ascii value of each character
 michaellan: :clap:
 TobiasA: wait what did you say emotes
 michaellan: emojis are in unicode
 TobiasA: woah this is a whole new level
 MSmits: yeah it looks really weird
 michaellan: a lot of ppl argue they shouldn't be
 michaellan: but i dont have the time nor energy to care
 michaellan: there's a "Fast random" class in the CGZero source code, i wonder if it's worth using
 michaellan: I'm currently just seeding to high-resolution time and using uniform_(int|real)_distribution 
 TobiasA: Msmits does is that the format your bot outputs commands or you convert it back?
 MSmits: i convert it back
 MSmits: have some recursive function for this
 MSmits: it's a stored tree of gamestates
 TobiasA: oh
 MSmits: basically i start at the root
 MSmits: first move is the best move from the root
 MSmits: then the one after that is the best reply
 TobiasA: you store your trees:scream:
 TobiasA: what kind of algorithm is that
 MSmits: a }  sign in the original string means you go back up the tree and try a sibling move thats less good for the purpose of opponent countering
 MSmits: well i used to counterbook players, but now i just automatically generate this tree locally
 MSmits: it's just for the opening of the game, for fixed start games
 TobiasA: oh locally
 MSmits: my current oware version has just 818 of these moves
 MSmits: but somehow this is enough to often take my game all the way down to 36 seeds on the board vs robo
 TobiasA: is robo a bot?
 MSmits: and we both seem to play perfectly according to my meta mcts
 MSmits: robosta c is a player
 MSmits: (nr 1 oware)
 TobiasA: oh 
 MSmits: i stop at 36 seeds as that is where my endgame book begins locally. So my opening doesnt go deeper than that
 MSmits: but because his bot is so good, he plays the same lines of play as my locally calculated tree
 TobiasA: how does he do his own endgames?
 MSmits: my bot is just a normal mcts + eval
 MSmits: so it does that when the opening book ends
 MSmits: but locally it just does a lookup
 MSmits: it makes the search a lot faster
 TobiasA: does robo also use an endgame book?
 MSmits: dont think so
 MSmits: but if you use it ingame, you cant go much further than 9 seeds
 MSmits: I think apart from me it's just tric trac doing this, he has 5 or 6 seeds
 MSmits: it's helpful though, it means perfect play when you get there
 MSmits: these NN's would definitely be stronger if they put some endgame books in
 MSmits: it's not really that much code either
 TobiasA: tomorrow is going to be the first time i use MCTS
 MSmits: that's cool
 TobiasA: one small step for me
 MSmits: try it on the simplest possible game first
 TobiasA: one big step for me kind
 MSmits: so you dont bug out on the sim
 TobiasA: i've started trying it on uttt
 MSmits: yeah uttt is a good way to get something working. The only problem is that the only way to know your bot is doing well is by the rank
 MSmits: you cant tell by actual gameplay
 MSmits: well unless it's *really* bad
 TobiasA: thanks for the advice
 MSmits: and unless of course you're a good uttt player yourself
 TobiasA: gtg
 MSmits: kk cya!
 TobiasA: goodnight
 YurkovAS: backpropagate 0 when node score &lt; 0 and parent has solved draw?
 MSmits: parent has a solved child that is a draw
 MSmits: that's a way to reduce bias 
 MSmits: otherwise you'll continuously explore that bad node and make the parent seem strong than it really is because you're not visiting the drawn child
 MSmits: stronger
 MSmits: this way you're visiting the bad child, but for the tree above that point, it seems you really visited the drawn node because you're backpropagating 0
 MSmits: so you get to explore a bad node, without introducing much bias
 MSmits: note: I am not actually using this anywhere on CG. I use it sometimes locally in meta mcts. It doesn't help all that much
 YurkovAS: thanks, I will experiment 
 N-ONE: jjjjjjjjkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkjj
 Wontonimo: just me and the mods again
 michaellan: and me
 MSmits: I am waiting for you two to burst into an argument about avocado's vs taco's
 reCurse: What about burritos
 michaellan: hehe
 michaellan: It seems that the official Multis are worth more CodinPoints than the community Multis, is that correct?
 MSmits: xxd it depends on the number of players, to a maximum of 500
 MSmits: if you're nr 1 in a  500 player game, you get the maximum 
 MSmits: however, because some games (like csb) have many more players, it's easier to get near the maximum
 MSmits: community games don't usually reach 500 players
 michaellan: Ah, that makes perfect sense
 michaellan: thanks
 michaellan: yeah, the equation in the help page is a bit confusing
 MSmits: it is, but eventually most players stop caring about cp other than a small carrot to keep going. It's better to pick games you actually like
 michaellan: Yeah, fair enough. I just want to estimate how difficult it would be to get grand master, thats my dream
 michaellan: but i guess i need to focus on the small things and the CP is the side effect
 MSmits: yeah focus on learning new things and apply them where it's fun
 MSmits: xxd were you the one that asked about ward in locam earlier?
 MSmits: "Since they always remove ward (with 1 exception)" 
 MSmits: I think there might be one creature that ignores ward?
 MSmits: not sure...
 michaellan: yeah, that was me;  odd. if so i completely missed it
 Conclure: myes
 Conclure: the objectively cool chat
 MSmits: no it's not that, there is some other reason for this exception
 MSmits: there is an item that just removes guard
 MSmits: maybe i was referring to that
 MSmits: anyway, gonna go get some sleep. Ttyl
 michaellan: im too lazy to look through all the cards
 michaellan: gn!
 Wontonimo: hey Conclure :wave:
 Wontonimo: gn MSmits
 Wontonimo: i must have left just before you got back on xxd
 Wontonimo: hey, you still haven't fixed your gold CSB bot xxd&#160;!
 dkim19375: Is it just me or is shortest so frequent&#160;;-;I got shortest mode 3 times in a row now
 michaellan: fixed? Wontonimo 
 michaellan: i dont see anything wrong with it
 michaellan: i never bothered to even code up the two-pods thing
 michaellan: i sorta just left it there after i passed silver :P
 michaellan: how do you know my gold bot is broken?
 Wontonimo: cuz it has a score of 1.14
 Wontonimo: hey, have you seen this video about Artificial Evolution / GA xxd <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL7tSgUpy8w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL7tSgUpy8w</a>
 michaellan: hmm
 Wontonimo: mmh?
 michaellan: so if i understand correctly, the model he's training is trained only to work on that map right?
 michaellan: oh thats the top comment's question
 Wontonimo: yeah, i think so.  now take a look at this GA which isn't learning moves, but learning the NN values <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfkfUQvKDw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfkfUQvKDw</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ I don't understand a thing this guy says but the video pretty much explains the whole thing and process
 Wontonimo: he uses flood fill&#160;;)
 michaellan: the video is making me dizzy
 michaellan: flood fill is nice
 michaellan: i'm gonna try writing fitness func for mars again
 Wontonimo: maybe your mutation function wasn't aggressive enough
 michaellan: i think if i do the distance correctly i will be very close
 michaellan: that is my gut feeling
 michaellan: may i ask what size "chunks" you used for your floodfill?
 michaellan: I think i'll try 50x50 first
 Wontonimo: i'll look
 michaellan: *another one of a gazillion hyperparameters to tune*
 Wontonimo: 50
 michaellan: nice
 Wontonimo: wow
 Wontonimo: nice call
 Wontonimo: another thing to add to the fitness is landing / crashing velocity.  All speed when crashing should count against the fitness
 Wontonimo: hitting the landing pad at mach ridiculous should count against fitness
 Wontonimo: I also tend to create a few "seeds" in a GA.  Like a soft bank left, right, straight up, and drop for all time steps.
 michaellan: yup, i incorpoarate speed currently
 michaellan: hmm
 michaellan: that sounds very difficult
 michaellan: i will keep that in mind but not do that for now
 michaellan: im wondering if i should use some variant on (1 / speed) or like (50 - speed)
 Wontonimo: okay, as far as "difficult", let's compare it to the mutate and random functions
 Wontonimo: lets say you make a function fill(degrees,thrust) which fills/makes a Genome with just that amount of degrees and thrust
 Wontonimo: in your while(enough time) loop where you explore and mutate genomes,
 michaellan: yeah but like what *is* a soft bank
 Wontonimo: 15 degrees
 michaellan: i'm unfamiliar with any of the particular physics that may accompany this
 michaellan: oh
 Wontonimo: 15 degrees is soft, with thrust 4
 michaellan: what does "for all time steps" mean
 michaellan: man i have so many questions for Di_masta but i can't reach him
 Wontonimo: if your genome is the actions your lander will take for the next 20 time steps, then it is 2 lists,
 Wontonimo: int thrust[20]
 Wontonimo: and 
 Wontonimo: int angle[20]
 Wontonimo: for 1 genome
 michaellan: each gene in my chromosome/genome currently corresponds to 1 time step
 michaellan: should i change that
 michaellan: I was wondering how one could get away with a genome of length 40 when each run is normally 100+ steps...
 Wontonimo: sure, you could do itstruct Gene { int thrust; int angle }
 Wontonimo: you could make the gene anything you want.  for example, it could have a third item after thrust and angle which is repeats, which means to repeat that instructions X many times
 Wontonimo: then your genome of length 20 could get your pod to 100 steps
 Wontonimo: but you don't need it to do all 100 steps in one go
 Wontonimo: at the end of the turn, your lander moves one turn, and you advance all the genomes 1 time step, and recalculate
 michaellan: I'm somehow segfaulting before I can print something out in the first line of int main()
 michaellan: i think higher powers are telling me to stop doing mars lander
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: i took a break from it for a couple weeks before finishing it
 michaellan: my code looks sorta nice though, I put these nice comments everywhere
 reCurse:  // Nice!
 michaellan: lolz
 Wontonimo: gn all
 Wontonimo: xxd , don't dream about programming GA
 RightHandElf: design a GA to dream about GAs for you
 Gameonn: Checkout it once, worth 5mins of your valuable time<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/@jindal.ankit89/just-9-tasks-per-day-can-change-your-life-forever-1bbceb220d91">https://medium.com/@jindal.ankit89/just-9-tasks-per-day-can-change-your-life-forever-1bbceb220d91</a>
 KamadoTanjiro: help
 xxd: You've literally sent this same link before
 xxd: how degenerate can you get Gameonn
 michaellan: ohhhh... segfaulting before main = too much data on the stack
 michaellan: RIP
 michaellan: i'm super confused still
 michaellan: omg... GNU g++ gives better error messages than clang++, shocker
 RightHandElf: lmao, I decided to do Mars Lander 1 in every language for easy xp and now I'm not allowed to submit for a few minutes
 hornymineta: yoyoyoyoyoy
 hornymineta: yoyoyooyoyoy
 hornymineta: whoooooooo
 ProCoder03: is there any starter kit kinda sample for UTTT bronze&#160;??? 
 super_girl_coder: hi
 michaellan: I've been tempted to do the every-language thing for the achievements but i've held off for now
 michaellan: theres more interesting things to pursue
 RightHandElf: I just wanna get past the "get level 20" thing in the achievement tree
 michaellan: do that by solving puzzles
 michaellan: much more worthwhile
 michaellan: though it may take longer
 RightHandElf: technically, I *was* solving it
 RightHandElf: it was just one puzzle being solved the same way
 xxd: bruh
 xxd: ProCoder0: what do you mean by starter kit?
 Westicles: RightHandElf, that's how it starts out, just going after achievements.  Then the sickness creeps in...
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/players_puzzles.php?level=medium&amp;commu=1&amp;player=3354337&amp;update=0">https://chadok.info/codingame/players_puzzles.php?level=medium&amp;commu=1&amp;player=3354337&amp;update=0</a>
 xxd: holy crud
 xxd: that is some commitment
 xxd: Escaping the cat: 0&#160;;)
 RightHandElf: you missed "escaping the cat"
 Westicles: heh heh, yeah I never liked trig much
 Westicles: someday I will get that bored...
 RightHandElf: on the one hand, basically any problem other than "mars lander 1" will probably require more than copying and pasting a single line with a one character difference
 RightHandElf: on the other hand, the website probably won't think I'm a bot
 xxd: mars lander 1 isnt even the easiest
 RightHandElf: it requires absolutely zero familiarity with the language you're using tho
 xxd: the thing is like with some languages, you need different approaches
 xxd: like i have haskell in mind but surely theres some others
 RightHandElf: maybe we have different solutions to mars lander 1
 xxd: mine is an if-else
 RightHandElf: I used that for some languages until I realized that it doesn't need to be synced to the inputs
 xxd: what do you mean?
 RightHandElf: so I just copied the default "print('0 3')" and pasted it as "print('0 4')"
 xxd: i dont get what you mean
 xxd: so you just output everythign at once?
 RightHandElf: you can just output '0 3' and '0 4' alternating and it'll work
 xxd: lol
 RightHandElf: you'll get a warning message about being out of sync but it works
 xxd: these are all symptoms that you need to find something better to do
 RightHandElf: and if it didn't, just copy and paste the input lines
 xxd: i like having few languages used
 RightHandElf: I will say that my original version in python used bitwise negation to swap a variable 'a' between 0 and -1 with print(0,4+a) as the output
 RightHandElf: but I didn't think that'd work well in bash
 xxd: lol
 xxd: you can just
 xxd: tr it
 xxd: tr/34/43
 Westicles: It is nice seeing people's solutions in all languages.  Even the clojure weirdos
 xxd: my floodfill thingy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/KgfwbDB.png">https://pasteboard.co/KgfwbDB.png</a>
 xxd: (or at least the first step of floodfill); thanks wontonimo!

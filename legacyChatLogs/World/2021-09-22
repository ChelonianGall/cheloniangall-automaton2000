 Warfist: welcome to greenwich mean time, beep boop
 NordTechSystems: so I'm having a hard time understanding the goal of the testcases and how it has a play button
 NordTechSystems: am I creating a script for the 3 examples
 NordTechSystems:&#160;?
 NordTechSystems: or however many exmaples
 NordTechSystems: {examples}
 NordTechSystems: because when I solve one and move to the next one, if I erase, it goes to incomplete again?
 ProCoder03: you need to write one script which will run in all situations
 MINHLUN: hello
 ProCoder03: hi&#160;!!
 MINHLUN: my name is Minh
 MINHLUN: I am from Viet Nam
 Westicles: Hi Minh.  How did you hear about codingame?
 Funsies: wow this is an awkward way to introduce some of these coding concepts
 Funsies: the pseudo IDE along with the vauge "coding challenge" setup doesn't give a great way to understand how to interact with the platform
 Westicles: you didn't understand the tutorial with all the little arrows and whatnot?
 Funsies: lol
 Funsies: I actually know how to code in multiple languages
 Funsies: I'm pretty sure I can handle the tutorial
 Funsies: doesn't change the fact that this is pretty awkward
 Funsies: but yeah, "little arrows"
 Westicles: as opposed to what?
 Funsies: literally any tutorial that uses an actual IDE with real debugging 
 Funsies: from literally any programming textbook or class?
 Funsies: I don't know, you tell me
 Westicles: This isn't set up as a teaching site.
 Funsies: no, it's set up as an obvious recruiting tool for people who are clueless about the actual skills of programmers to churn through whatever freshers have a handle on algorithms
 Funsies: gotcha.
 Westicles: You seem angry about programming puzzles for some reason
 Funsies: but you seem pretty invested in it for some reason
 Funsies: lol, there's lots of actual legit programming puzzle sites my friend
 jacek: multiplayer games bots :heart:
 Westicles: would you feel more comfortable if there were more memes and yt videos?
 Funsies: No, but I'd feel more comfortable if there were less insufferable asshats within 5 minutes of using the platform
 Funsies: probably someone with "engineer" as a title still as well.
 Westicles: engineer? lol I'm in middle school
 Funsies: if you say so
 Funsies: interesting you have atop achievements in every single language while most of your account follows are asiapac and east europe though
 Funsies: definitely screams middle school
 Funsies: or... I don't know, invested shill?
 Funsies: I think I'll go with option B myself.
 jacek: oO
 Funsies: ok then
 Funsies: back to leetcode, this was fun
 Funsies: definitely not some sketchy Eastern botfarm garbage
 Funsies: got it.
 Westicles: Best of luck.  Stay weird and angry, I'll take that over dumb any day
 ProCoder03: wait Westicles, I thought were a software engineer or something like that :scream:...
 mr.bossman: dont worry he just found this site first
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: there is one impostor among us
 Automaton2000: well, i guess we have to make a simple bot
 ProCoder03: for what Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it should be pretty much the first thing i thought of a way to check the time
 therealbeef: That was a funny rant from Funsies
 DJTenYearOldDictator_63b0: huck norris

 AmazingPro: hello
 dreadylein: hi
 ProCoder03: hi
 whywhy_: Hi, does anyone know how to add images to clash of code contributions? Thanks
 derjack: can clashes have images? oO
 Uljahn: guess it's impossible, use ASCII-art
 ProCoder03: ig you can't.. whywhy_
 struct: Think I finally coded the move gen for loa
 struct: I was overthinking on how to code it
 darkhorse64: magic bitboards&#160;?
 struct: no just shifts
 struct: and a few &amp; and - operations
 struct: I dont really understood magic bitboards yet
 darkhorse64: pext for counting checkers&#160;?
 struct: The only array I have to help getting moves is the rays
 struct: no pext there is a better way I think
 struct:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I haven't started coding a bot
 struct: Yeah, im doing slow progress
 struct: I always waste a lot of time on the start
 struct: Because everytime I code something I can see that I could have code it in a better way
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22663187">https://stackoverflow.com/a/22663187</a>
 struct: this is what I used to replace the pext
 darkhorse64: No need to hurry, there are lots of things to do for search
 struct: I basicly check all the opponent bits that are between the from and where I want to go
 struct: and then and the opponent pieces with the "ray" that i moving
 struct: im *moving
 struct: If there is any piece there then it return not 0
 struct: maybe pext can be better I havent tried it tbh
 derjack: any idea for eval?
 struct: I thought of something when I was in bed
 darkhorse64: Look for Winands papers
 struct: but dont know if it will work
 struct: eval on ludii was center control
 struct: im not sure how good it is
 struct: I cant understand this game yet
 Astrobytes: centre control seems sensible but not the only factor
 darkhorse64: actually you do not need pext. You need a mask and count the remaining bits for piece range 
 struct: yes
 struct: its what I do
 struct: the mask is
 struct: to - from
 struct: or from - to
 struct: depends who has the highest bit
 struct: all bits in that range will be set
 darkhorse64: pext is only interesting if you need to reason on the bit pattern. Free slot or opp in slot, no blocking opponent, ...
 struct: I dont think I ever used it
 darkhorse64: I use it massively for yavalath
 darkhorse64: threat/trap/winning move detection
 derjack: i wonder how fast would be to count the number of separate chains
 struct: should be pretty fast
 struct: Im still wondering how to get a random move without calculating all of them
 DaNinja: LOA is on another site?
 derjack: its contribution
 DaNinja: ah I see
 struct: i probably will do minimax
 struct: or depth 0 ept
 derjack: do depth 0 minimax

 Thyl: Who search a team for the escape contest&#160;???
 struct: Wontonimo was searching iirc
 struct: he is from Canada, maybe he can speak french
 Thyl: in english or in french
 struct: He usually is on a bit later on the day, I guess you could try to talk with him
 Thyl: cool
 Thyl: thx
 Thyl: [CG]Thibaud it will be very cool if a channel will create for search a team
 Thyl: in DIscord
 Astrobytes: what's wrong with the existing #coding-escape channel on discord?
 BlaiseEbuth: It exists?
 eulerscheZahl: usually there are contest-specific channels. let's see if something like this will happen when the fall challenge gets announced
 eulerscheZahl: so i can instantly mute the new channel again :imp:
 Wontonimo: if there are no CP awarded, I'm not in
 Astrobytes: yeah mines muted too lol
 eulerscheZahl: no CP confirmed already
 Astrobytes: there is no CP
 Wontonimo: then i'm out
 eulerscheZahl: maybe there are tshirts? just speculating, i don't know anything
 Wontonimo: i have enough tshirts
 Thyl: ooo
 Thyl: any one else&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, i wanted to share the huawei contest on discord
 eulerscheZahl: still waiting for my smart watch from the last round
 Wontonimo:&#160;??  link plz

 Thyl: ...
 struct: gl for today euler
 Thyl: If you want to code
 eulerscheZahl: i soon have a match on yare
 eulerscheZahl: thanks struct
 eulerscheZahl: yare has priority. no time for codechef
 Astrobytes: hm, graph optim problem?
 Astrobytes: Oh gl for Yare
 Thyl: What's Yare
 Thyl:&#160;????
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. and yes, another graph on codeforces

 ImRed: hello
 struct:  grats
 struct: Didnt even see that dapp was eliminated
 eulerscheZahl: lucky me, i have problems against circles
 El_Nino619: kys
 eulerscheZahl: and the rusher (Alion) is out as well
 eulerscheZahl: huh, did I miss something?
 struct: yes acronym
 struct: or w/e its called
 eulerscheZahl: anagram?
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: isn't Nino the santa clause?
 eulerscheZahl: there's that El Nino effect where warm ocean water heats up the coast in the winter if i recall my geography lessons correctly
 struct: no acronym was right

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html">https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html</a>
 struct: I skipped geography
 eulerscheZahl: i kept it to get rid of economics
 eulerscheZahl: even had my final oral exam in geography
 eulerscheZahl: + written in physics, maths, latin
 struct: o.o
 eulerscheZahl: i needed a language and didn't want to gamble with German or English. I hate creative writing
 eulerscheZahl: and as there was no basic Latin course on my school, I took the advanced one (you can/have to take 2 advanced courses, the others are basic)
 struct: damn, I never had to learn any of that
 eulerscheZahl: and there was no comp sci offered at my school
 struct: on uni?
 struct: have to go, soccer time, good luck on your next match euler
 eulerscheZahl: i'm jealous :soccer:
 Wontonimo: what's your algo for yare euler?
 eulerscheZahl: if-else monster
 eulerscheZahl: a bit of simulation to know if i will win a group fight
 Wontonimo: looks like very specific hand-coded logic to harvest the star in the beginning 
 Wontonimo: quite optimized
 Wontonimo: no point in simulating and searching that part if it is so predictable and consistent
 jacek: eulerscheZahl we have :soccer: at home. :soccer: at home: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/paper-soccer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/paper-soccer</a>

 eulerscheZahl: i order my units by a mix of energy and dist to enemy. and chain the energy from the stronger to the weaker units
 Ksush_eli: пппппппппп
 eulerscheZahl: but just greedy. another player mentioned doing max flow
 Ksush_eli: лоаолао
 eulerscheZahl: please don't spam n's or Cyrillic letters

 jacek: try proxy
 jacek: funny talkchess was blocked for poland :x
 EduFireHeart: After creating an account here, I received an invite to take a test
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yes. I got it with a belgium vpn
 EduFireHeart: I took the test and now I don't know where to find its results other than using the link I received by mail
 EduFireHeart: is there an option anywhere around here to check it directly instead of having to go to my email?
 BlaiseEbuth: No idea. These tests are pretty new, and account created before don't have access to it...
 EduFireHeart:  thanks, that's a bit odd to me I can't see them directly through my account
 Astrobytes: jacek: that's pretty impressive
 jacek: though i think he talks about raw move generation. lets wait to see full engine with it
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure, still seems pretty damn fast though
 Astrobytes: Cool technique also
 jacek: lets wait for smits to implement in Y
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Warfist: afternoon all. i'm a computah
 ArtuurNeves: Is it possible to make a private clash with some challenges from Practice?
 jacek: no
 Astrobytes: You can race with your friends for completion of the puzzles in Practice if you like, timing you'll have to do yourself though
 Z3r0Tru5tK4l1: if I'm not wrong you are able to create a private clash but you need at least 1 other participant other than you, and the challenges are randomized, escept you can choose the type of clash as well as language
 Astrobytes: Z3r0Tru5tK4l1: They were referring to the puzzles in the Practice session to know if they were available within clash constraints
 Z3r0Tru5tK4l1: aaaahhhh, gotcha, my bad
 Astrobytes: no worries
 jacek: i have index from and index to. i want a number with set bits in from...to indexes. most efficient way to do it?
 Astrobytes: Just a mask?
 Astrobytes: Doesn't seem inefficient at least
 AmineMachine: How do i take the assessment that ranks me as 'better than x% of developers?' saw it the first time but now i cant find it.
 jacek: is reddit dead? oO
 Astrobytes: It was working a while ago. If it's down right now it will -  unfortunately - probably return.
 jacek: i need my memes
 Astrobytes: lo and behold it is working again

 DripGoku: or som 
 DripGoku: i think its in brackets
 DripGoku: how u share it?

 struct: you can share the code
 struct: you can view the code after you complete it
 DripGoku: .
 struct: even if its 0%
 DripGoku: .
 Thorcode: drip finish?
 DripGoku: thor can u copy and paste his code
 Thorcode: wait
 struct: he cant see the code yet
 Thorcode: well i am changing the + to *
 struct: for loop should be the way to solve this I guess
 DripGoku: i notivr
 DripGoku: notice*
 DripGoku: i cant private message a mod
 Thorcode: to whome
 DripGoku: struct
 struct: what
 struct: just make the question
 Thorcode: is this multiple the number of the num
 DripGoku: im not talking to u struct im talking about
 DripGoku: bc i cant private message a mid
 DripGoku: mod*
 DripGoku: thor
 struct: yes Thorcode
 Thorcode: well it can be struct block to send private message
 struct: The statement should say that
 DripGoku: subit the code 
 Thorcode: Print the product of the digits in the form of an integer
 Thorcode: cuz the output say this
 struct: well the product of the numbers
 struct: is the multiplication of the numbers
 DripGoku: struct
 DripGoku: can u copy and paste your code

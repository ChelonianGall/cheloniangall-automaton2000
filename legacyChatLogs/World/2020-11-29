 Mr-DillinG: Hi
 DevonLarratt: clash of code is an insane way to learn a new language damn
 pucck: Best solution ever
 VizGhar: just tried OCAML language on onboarding puzzle. OMG is there really any person on this planet using this language?
 eulerscheZahl: it felt easier to me than Clojure
 VizGhar: Cojure was pain too&#160;:|
 eulerscheZahl: indeed :D
 R2B2: @VizGhar: yes, Ocaml is widely used. Functional programming languages are more robust than most others, and are therefore used where security is an important concern (you can check the OCaml website if you want to learn more).
 VizGhar: I'll check for sure. To be honest I haven't used functional languages that much.
 VizGhar: I really love the concept of pure functions. I just took different path in my youth :P
 BoBot: so...you took a path of impurity? :O
 VizGhar: no... talking just about OOP vs FP
 VizGhar: but yes I wrote that strangely :D
 JohnCM: euler, you there?
 JohnCM: wanted to seek help on how to generate entire list of permutations in c++ for bulls and cows 2
 rockstar555: hii
 eulerscheZahl: ping JohnCM
 eulerscheZahl: just a recursive function that loops over each next digit given a bool[] of already used digits
 BoBot: @VizGhar no you did not wrote it strangely, I was just joking :D
 Magnitik: can sombody give me a hint about Power of Thor Epizode 1, pleas:cold_sweat:
 JBM: remember where you are
 Magnitik: thanks
 rockstar555: if you think you got answer
 Magnitik: no, i didnt)
 rockstar555: and consentrate
 rockstar555: also

 AntiSquid: dude stop pasting same link over and over again msd9126
 AntiSquid: also no clash of code links in here
 AntiSquid: #clash 
 rockstar555: okk
 rockstar555: you are saying right 
 msd9126: Sorry
 rockstar555: AnitiSquid
 rockstar555: msd9126
 rockstar555: you send link
 rockstar555: by private message
 AntiSquid: rockstar555 you keep writing random gibberish btw, can't figure out what you're on about
 Uljahn: i guess that guy is spaming him in pm
 AntiSquid: rockstar555 just use google translate for a bit if english is difficult, it's fine .
 Doju: Oh hey my search is finally sometimes going to depth 2
 Doju: that's improvement, i guess :d
 Uljahn: the entrance to the rabbit hole
 AntiSquid: now you can take it deeper! exponential thinking doju!
 Doju: Well, the problem at the moment is python
 rockstar555: soory
 Doju: so if im gonna take it deeper i'm gonna have to move to c++
 rockstar555: why
 Doju: It's just so slow
 rockstar555: ohh
 rockstar555: so you can move to c++
 Doju: if i have the time
 AntiSquid: do it doju . it might seem difficult but it's worth it .
 AM.80: Hi budies
 AntiSquid: or Rust or even D-lang master race
 Doju: i have another programming project on my hands at the moment
 jrke: yeah c++,rust,java,D are good choices for fall challenge
 rockstar555: if u writing a short code
 Doju: I think i'm gonna go with c++ since i want to learn it anyways
 rockstar555: then go with
 rockstar555: ruby
 rockstar555: otherwisw
 Uljahn: python is slow by design but you can make your code optimized and a bit faster with knowledge of python internals
 Doju: sure
 rockstar555: yeah
 JohnCM: ha just learn c++
 Doju: im gonna try a few things first
 JohnCM: so far all competitions top tier is c++
 rockstar555:  it saying wright
 jrke: the worst thing you can face on CG - "STUCKED IN TOP GOLD AND TRYING FOR LEGEND&#160;:("
 Uljahn: with c++ it's a no-brainer i guess, add more pragmas
 msd9126: #clash
 AntiSquid: no . don't spam that chat room link either . if someone wants to play clash they will . msd9126
 msd9126: Thanks!
 AntiSquid: you don't see anyone continuously asking you to join one of the multiplayers, do you 
 tibithegreat: out of curiosity: What is the memory limit on multiplayer games? (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe for example)
 Uljahn: 768Mb
 tibithegreat: wanna see if it's worth spending time deleting stuff
 rockstar555: hey i have some problem in code vs Zombie
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>

 Westicles: It seems I have a mortal enemy.  One guy rejecting both my contributions
 Doju: Oh huh
 Doju: it's actually faster to make a bunch of small tuples than a bunch of small np arrays
 Doju: even though i do some vector math
 AllYourWhat: i could see that if your tuples are small... maybe the overhead of allocating a numpy array and calling into a c function for every operation isn't worth it?
 Doju: yeah, that's probably the case, AllYourWhat
 jacek: use c++ [solved]
 Doju: yup
 Doju: that's the correct solution but i don't have the time to rewrite everything in an unfamiliar language
 Doju: aw man
 Doju: when deepcopying gamestates, i get 244 nodes in my tree
 Doju: when not copying, i get 851 nodes
 Uljahn: btw do you have __slots__ defined in your class?
 Doju: No. In fact i didn't know that that existed
 Doju: Im gonna have a look
 Uljahn: can make some boost to performance
 AllYourWhat: wow thats interesting, thanks for sharing Uljahn!
 Doju: I need to rewrite my deepcopy method but __slots__ seems really useful. thanks Uljahn
 ProMikeSundays: let's go
 Doju: Also i'm storing a bunch of useless values
 Doju: tomeIndex and taxCount for already learned spells, for example
 Doju: Okay i think i figured out a way to improve performance by a lot
 Westicles: Fight the power!

 HooKOnFire: ok
 ZarthaxX: thought you kicked him before
 ZarthaxX: did he re enter and started again?
 ZarthaxX: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i did
 eulerscheZahl: but that saxophone player was without warning
 ZarthaxX: does a kick do anything or you can just refresh and talk again?
 HooKOnFire: yes
 ZarthaxX: ah ye
 eulerscheZahl: refresh and you are back
 ZarthaxX: i see&#160;:(
 HooKOnFire: when you refresh and back
 eulerscheZahl: no you don't, do you want to ZarthaxX? :P

 ZarthaxX: oh god this oneagain
 eulerscheZahl: squid did the banning
 ZarthaxX: fastest in the far west
 eulerscheZahl: good guy toad is still at 0 bans, i have more patience
 ZarthaxX: hehe
 ZarthaxX: i would ban them isntantly
 eulerscheZahl: but i was close now. just squid being a little faster
 ZarthaxX: you know, in uni they gave us a project where we had to make algorithms to optimize a specific problem
 ZarthaxX: and they said we had to also implement tabu search
 ZarthaxX: i dont like that thing
 ZarthaxX: well, that guy deserved it from minute 0 lol
 Westicles: Is it by account or name?
 eulerscheZahl: account
 eulerscheZahl: they can create new accounts

 struct: hi
 Westicles: Oooh, snap.  "IMHO, it’s a burden to get boring puzzles accepted"
 JBM: well, that's, like, my own opinion man
 Westicles:&#160;:)
 Westicles: It is an interesting point.  I've had arguments about the definition of 'puzzle', 'ingenuity', and 'fun' lately.  We really need a philosophical underpinning before we can go forward with these contributions.

 Astrobytes: building up to UTTT 3D edition
 reCurse: Reminds me we never did test if mod can ban mod right?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: want to try?
 reCurse: Keep tempting me :P
 Astrobytes: We did, I'm sure? Separate channel, you banned euler or he banned you iirc
 reCurse: euler wasn't a mod back then I think
 Astrobytes: Oh right, testing whether it was one channel or all, I remember now
 reCurse: It was testing how to unban actually
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 struct: is it possible to unban?
 reCurse: Yes
 struct: so ban me i dont mind
 reCurse: Missing the point here :P
 Westicles: I told rockstar how to become a moderator in exchange for approving my puzzle, but he didn't do it
 struct: I think he would be a good addition
 reCurse: Working on a contribution makes me realize just how far one can go coding by google
 jacek: youre working on contribution?
 reCurse: Yeah
 jacek: oh my
 reCurse: So far I'm just getting by asking how to do C# stuff in java or javascript
 reCurse: Almost too easy
 Doju: yikes
 jacek: java is just lowercase C#
 Doju: there has been a nasty bug hiding in my code for a loong time
 Westicles: Are there instructions somewhere for &lt;whatever you call the package you submit for graphics puzzles&gt; or do you just need to figure it out by example?
 reCurse: Are you talking about pixi?
 struct: or for graphic entity module?
 Westicles: Talking about what you submit for something like Space Maze.

 struct: Doesnt go into much depth
 Westicles: Ah, thanks!  Now I get why you have to google java and JS, ugh
 reCurse: Well I wouldn't need to do JS if I used the GEM
 struct: I think most of the current accepted contributions dont use js modules at all
 reCurse: I'm just a control freak or something
 Westicles: what would you use if you wanted something like this?

 struct: yeah, that doesnt seem feasible with gem
 struct: because of all the params you can change
 Westicles: hmmm
 struct: you can choose any js framework I think, which gives quite a bit more work
 reCurse: Any js framework?
 reCurse: So you just ignore the given pixi container?
 struct: yes

 reCurse: Man JS is a hot mess
 reCurse: Thankfully in this case... maybe?
 reCurse: How far fetched is it to have a viewer that steals your code
 reCurse: Because if you have access to dom...
 JBM: it'ssupposed not to have access out of its iframe
 JBM: ...until the next exploit
 reCurse: The viewer is inside a iframe?
 struct: yes
 JBM: yes
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Slightly reassuring then. But only slightly.
 JBM: i've tried to use it before to add proper CSS styling to my statements
 JBM: ...fail
 struct: I dont think localy its inside iframe
 struct: but on CG it is
 reCurse: I'm really not sure what you want anymore on that forum thread JBM, so I'll leave it at that
 JBM: I'm not asking for anything
 reCurse: You made a vague claim I provided counterexample to, and now I have to prove that everything is absolutely sure to be 100% the same
 JBM: I'd like the GCC doc to confirm #pragma-level optimization perform the same as command-line
 reCurse: I don't get it
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a bit late again&#160;:(the JS part is fun. initially I had the viewer control bar above the actual replay by accident :D
 reCurse: I really don't
 JBM: your counterexample is a data point
 reCurse: So was your initial claim
 JBM: it doesn't disprove much in my view
 reCurse: In fact you didn't provide a single point
 JBM: my initial claim is "I can't be sure the optimization level reaches the same levels"
 JBM: no i didnt't
 JBM: hence the "fear" part
 reCurse: Yeah not sure what else I was expecting
 Doju: How many different gamestates do you guys search?
 reCurse: eulerscheZahl Is the viewer bar part of the iframe or not?
 JBM: your message sounded like you wanted me to answer "oh that solves all my problems thank you I'll use C++ now"
 reCurse: No you were making a claim with no example, and I provided you reassurance that STL templates do get inlined properly with the pragma
 reCurse: But trying to help just turned into a slap so whatever
 JBM: oh
 JBM: sorry
 JBM: wasn't the intent
 JBM: it all started from pb4's "why c not C++"
 JBM: so i don't exactly have c++ code to measure again
 Westicles: I can give you a datapoint.  If you are running c++ from another language, the pragmas often cause it to fail but the compiler flags don't
 JBM: fail how?
 pb4: Hi
 pb4: Definitely didn't read that as a slap reCurse
 reCurse: Ok my bad then
 Westicles: Not sure, just gives you 0% on everything
 eulerscheZahl: the progress bar is inside the iframe reCurse
 JBM: recurse and I often have trouble understanding each other
 JBM: knowing about it is half of avoiding it
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/nGoedXb.png">https://i.imgur.com/nGoedXb.png</a>
 reCurse: Maybe read too much into "expert opinion" and "contrived example" and the whole "but it's on a heap" when it wasn't the point
 struct: yeah  just checked
 struct: its in iframe
 pb4: JBM&#160;: not sure I fully understand the at() comment though
 reCurse: Just felt frustrating
 pb4: the GLIBCXX_DEBUG flag applies check on the [] operator too
 JBM: the at comment was: vector is only really ('cuz i preallocate) different from an array if you use at() instead of []
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/849340c736362b181cdae18a8345462538aa01">https://www.codingame.com/demo/849340c736362b181cdae18a8345462538aa01</a>my teapot example just removed everything inside the iframe. progress bar gone
 reCurse: So can you control the progress bar from inside the viewer?
 reCurse: Say if I wanted to make a button "go back to beginning"
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't try to go the other way but should be possible, yes
 reCurse: That would be awesome actually...
 struct: i recal cg saying it wasnt possible :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i considered removing the settings button
 JBM: pb4: i don't know much about GLIBXX_DEBUG tbh
 JBM: pb4: i'll have to read up
 reCurse: Well if the progress bar was outside the iframe then yeah it's a no go
 eulerscheZahl: as i removed the panel where you can change settings anyway
 reCurse: If it's inside though, you could simulate clicking on it or something
 pb4: I haven't found much documentation on it...
 pb4: And reading the STL is...... hard......
 reCurse: I've always suspected it's hard to read so people don't rely on implementation details :D
 eulerscheZahl: struct also added some text below the viewer long ago. in an extra section between viewer and statement that he created
 JBM: is ths g++ one still the sgi-derived one?
 pb4: What I learned in practice is&#160;:- it'll slow your code to 1/100th its speed- it'll crash if you access data out of bounds- on CG, it'll tell you the type of container that was accessed oob, the real size of the contained, the index that was accessed if relevant. It will *not* tell you where in your code this happened
 pb4: A more helpful to do things would be to roll your own vector&lt;&gt; implementation, but I don't usually use mine. I should though...
 JBM: oooh, nice
 pb4: (not implementation, wrapper around vector and arary)
 reCurse: Only if you need to avoid the heap allocation
 pb4: I have both reCurse
 reCurse: Oh for the accessor, right
 pb4: I have the "stackvector" for no heap allocation, and the "heapvector" which is just a wrapper around vector for debugging purposes
 pb4: I hadn't considered that before&#160;: can I "overwrite" the begin(), end() and [] operators for std::vector&#160;?
 reCurse: Yes sure
 reCurse: As long as you don't get casted back to vector
 AntiSquid: anyone here doing raic btw&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: #raic2020

 Bobbadillio: Ouch. How did it fail? I might have to take a look.
 Bobbadillio: I've never done RAIC before, but maybe it would fill the Halite shaped hole in my life that remains after Kaggle's... attempt.
 AntiSquid: did you like kaggle halite&#160;? :D
 Bobbadillio: Not at all
 AntiSquid: btw raic LB is very random 
 Bobbadillio: I did Halite I-III, and the kaggle version is the first one that I just didn't bother with.

 AntiSquid: kaggle isn't good for multi games
 eulerscheZahl: i disagree on the randomness of the RAIC leaderboad
 Bobbadillio: Yeah, I'm hopeful that they'll get better. A minimum starting point is support for non-python languages, IMO
 eulerscheZahl: if there are many bots with a similar level of strength, of course there are some ups and downs
 AntiSquid: dunno about this year
 AntiSquid: was talking about last year
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: i, recar is playing RAIC
 Bobbadillio: Ah. This year, I think I've heard they're still considering fog of war, right? 
 eulerscheZahl: oh, recar*
 Bobbadillio: I assume damage is deterministic?
 eulerscheZahl: there will be fog of war in a higher league
 AntiSquid: unit damage: 10-18 :Dthat would be fine imo
 eulerscheZahl: looks deterministic to me
 AntiSquid: it's when navigation acceleration and aim are random that really ruins it
 eulerscheZahl: the only randomness is the order of actions
 AntiSquid: i'd be fine with random damage is all im saying
 eulerscheZahl: as you have to return a dictionary of &lt;unitId, action&gt;
 AntiSquid: they randomize that&#160;?
 AntiSquid: do ships sink if they collide&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: dictionary is random order by default
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your exact command
 eulerscheZahl: play default AI vs WAIT
 eulerscheZahl: default will try to move to the opposite corner
 AntiSquid: there's ordered map in c++, didn't check how they implemented it though
 eulerscheZahl: and then shoot at the own units to reach the corner
 eulerscheZahl: there is a breakthrough option in your command
 Bobbadillio: the ordered/unordered discussion made me double check, but it looks like python switched to ordered dictionaries by default on 3.6
 eulerscheZahl: the RAIC manual says that movement order is random
 Bobbadillio: sure, makes sense. I wonder if it's really random, or just not guaranteed? Anyway, if they say it's random it's random.
 ZarthaxX: toad what is the CPU time per turn for RAIC?
 eulerscheZahl: dunno
 eulerscheZahl: last year: 20ms / tick + 1min in total
 eulerscheZahl: (timebank)
 dbf: 40 secs for 1000 ticks, 1 sec max per tick
 ZarthaxX: i see, tyguys
 Zenoscave: cool blockout eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: thanks zeno
 Zenoscave: If a piece falls out of boundary but the x,z coordinate are fine, it still says the coordinate is out of bounds
 Zenoscave: I like it so far though! I can't wait for it to polish up
 eulerscheZahl: "falls out of boundary"?you mean that you give x,z in range but the tile is too big to fir completely inside?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if that needs a different error message
 Zenoscave: I think it would be at least good to note in the instructions? Did i miss it?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean to better explain the expected x and z values that your should print?
 Zenoscave: Yes. It makes sense to me immediately, but I have experience with these kind of solo games. less experienced may find the instructions dense
 Zenoscave: just food for thought
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you are right. maybe a better visual example
 eulerscheZahl: i don't really define x,y,z directions either
 Zenoscave: Perhaps
 Zenoscave: Also how do you rotate a piece?
 eulerscheZahl: y = height might not be instantly clear
 eulerscheZahl: you are given all rotations in input
 Zenoscave: you say it in the image
 Astrobytes: x,y,z directions are clear from the diagram no?
 Zenoscave: ^ thi
 Zenoscave: this
 eulerscheZahl: not given in text. but yes, the picture might be enough
 Astrobytes: if the user can't understand the diagram they have no business attempting the gameimo :D
 Astrobytes: *game imo
 Zenoscave: The picture should suffice, just a small expansion on what placeing a "2 2  1 ####" piece on 4 0 might be illegal
 Zenoscave: in a 5x5x12 pit
 Zenoscave: I agree with astro, it is a more advanced game for sure.
 eulerscheZahl: not good for medium section?
 Zenoscave: I'd say good for medium if extra explanation is given (spoon fed) 
 Astrobytes: I think medium is OK tbh, just depends if people are comfortable working with 3d coordinates
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue for most
 Zenoscave: The problem itself is not hard. just foriegn
 eulerscheZahl: i already give the rotations for spoon feeding
 Zenoscave: Then I guess medium works&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: I really like this game
 Zenoscave: also Hi astro and euler
 Astrobytes: hehe hi zeno, pewpew
 Zenoscave: pewpew
 ZarthaxX: no hi for me?
 ZarthaxX: sad
 eulerscheZahl: glad to hearthis time it wasn't even about creating a game that's nice for the user but something that's interesting for me as a creator
 Astrobytes: zaaaaarthoooo
 Zenoscave: ZarthaxX!!!! I didn't see you were on
 ZarthaxX: ASTROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 Zenoscave: PEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEW
 Zenoscave: hiiiiiii
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave yes im not talking lol
 ZarthaxX: pewpewpepwepw
 ZarthaxX: i have 2 consecutive exams tommorrow and the next day
 ZarthaxX: im gonna die :D
 Astrobytes: meh, you'll be fine
 Zenoscave: Yikes zarthie
 Zenoscave: no dying
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i once had that too
 Astrobytes: you got this mah dude
 eulerscheZahl: 2 exams on Friday, one on Saturday
 Astrobytes: It's brutal. But the momentum keeps you sharp
 Zenoscave: I once finished an exam in 4 minutes flat
 Zenoscave: It scared the other takers
 Astrobytes: lol wat. Grade?
 ZarthaxX: i dont have the 2 in the same day
 Zenoscave: 105%
 ZarthaxX: wtf toad 2 same day,illegal
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 ZarthaxX: 4 MINS LMAO
 ZarthaxX: mah man Astrobytes ty
 eulerscheZahl: momentum kept me so sharp, last thing i did was measuring the current in Volt
 eulerscheZahl: up voltage in Ampere? I forgot
 eulerscheZahl: stupid mistake costing me the better grade at least :D
 Zenoscave: It was open ended short answer questions only. The prof is known for accepting any answer that proves you understand the answer no matter how formal or lacking it is
 Astrobytes: amperes for current lol
 Zenoscave: Most people took an hour
 Astrobytes: awesome
 ZarthaxX: current in volts lol sad
 Zenoscave: isn't current colombs?
 Zenoscave: I'm bad @ EE
 Astrobytes: I think I made that mistake in my highschool physics exams euler
 Astrobytes: *exam
 eulerscheZahl: 3rd semester of Bachelor for me
 Zenoscave: I forgot to do the back half of a final once
 Zenoscave: didn't realize the page was double sided
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: It depends on the context Zeno
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: but more used for charge iirc
 eulerscheZahl: pro tip: toilet paper has 2 sides too
 sahilrox: 4, if you're willing to use the edges
 Zenoscave: do blockout pieces have 2 sides?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :poop:
 eulerscheZahl: 6 sides even if the rendering isn't glitching around
 struct: raic is 1000 frames per player?
 eulerscheZahl: yes struct
 struct: damn
 struct: if cg had that
 eulerscheZahl: that's low for RAIC standards
 Zenoscave: gz
 eulerscheZahl: codeball had 18k frames
 Zenoscave: struct on legend FC20
 struct: ty zeno
 Astrobytes: oh gratz struct!
 struct: I got pushed from 40th to legend
 struct: ty
 eulerscheZahl: a full 5min match at 60FPS
 Astrobytes: big push
 eulerscheZahl: i think i congratulated already. in case I forgot: congrats
 Zenoscave: Same I didn't even have a decent submit active when I was pushed
 struct: thanks
 struct: Now I need to work on this 3d stuff
 Westicles: I once had a professor in a wheelchair who was sort of famous for doing TV specials.  I tried to get on his good side with flattery and he manipulated me into mowing his lawn
 eulerscheZahl: the Tom Sawyer prof
 Zenoscave: Westicles did you end up on the good side?
 Westicles: Well, I have the keys to his house and he left town for the summer, so that worked out.  Otherwise, no
 Westicles: had
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Uljahn: almost 15M in 2048 :persevere:
 eulerscheZahl: well done. and i thought the game would be dead by now
 Westicles: Still mildly puzzled about what we missed that dbdr didn't
 eulerscheZahl: the good path :D
 Westicles: Yeah.  I suspect you have to steer towards it early on.  
 MadKnight: how could 2048 be dead Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i want to play the game
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/N5ZUGm.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/N5ZUGm.jpg</a>
 dbdr: that publish button looks dangerous :D
 Westicles: Somebody tweet xevixevi, he's our only hope
 dbdr: I got back CGFunge from her&#160;:)
 Westicles: he's a her?
 dbdr: I think so, based on google translate of one of her tweets&#160;:)
 Westicles: That's gotta be like, what, 1/10,000 around here?
 dbdr: Close to 90% of our respondents identify as “male”.However, the proportion of women who took part in our survey has progressed from 6% (2 years ago) to 8.7% (last year) to 11.5% this year.Baby steps in the right direction.

 Westicles: Not saying this is evidence against it, but Other:I like liquor,I like cats, I likewomen
 dbdr: well, the tweet I mentioned was actually a retweet, so I don't know&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: still pushing for the 50% ratio in everything 
 lifetimeLearner007: does remainingTurns in PowerOfThor have any use in code golf?
 lifetimeLearner007: I mean can we shorten the code if its used?
 kovi: wow, nice dbdr
 AntiSquid: oh i like this one, for all the JS haters on CG: "Node.js, React and .NETCore make the topthree, closely followed by AngularJS andSpring."
 kovi: cgfunge i mean. not sure what is happenening below 20k, but below 5k
 dbdr: thanks kovi! (funge right?)I had to work a lot to get it back
 dbdr: at 20-25k you are still solving the general problem, right?
 dbdr: I think &lt;10k is where everyone starts to use the specific list of numbers 
 kovi: i c
 kovi: wicked hardcoders&#160;:)
 dbdr: join the dark side, this is where the fun starts&#160;;)
 Westicles: Fixed, known validators and offline search?
 kovi: i started raic...
 dbdr: Westicles: yes
 dbdr: euler even increased the number of validators to 100
 dbdr: it's not enough :D
 dbdr: but the hardcoding is an interesting problem anyways, so there is no issue
 Westicles: Thanks, sounds like fun
 struct: eulerscheZahl still there?
 struct: I was having problems with stuff disapearing with three js
 struct: but I think i fixed it, do you still have the problem?
 dbdr: 36 seconds late
 miszu: sup all
 miszu: how's everyone?
 struct: hi miszu
 miszu: my MCTS is not working. Time to debug it
 miszu: but at least I am confident about my game simulations
 DqmnJyres: hi
 miszu: what's the correct way to add an offset to a pointer?
 miszu: ptr + offset? Where offset could be value from 0 to 9 let's say
 miszu: or am I forgetting something
 struct: ptr + n
 miszu: do I need to take account to the size of pointer?
 Allis: @miszu It happens automatically.
 miszu: ok ty
 struct: I think pointers are always same size
 miszu: I am having a weird bug and it is due to pointer arithmetic but can't figure why.
 Allis: They are, but doing pointer arithmetic takes into account the size of the pointed to object.
 Allis: So `ptr + 1` refers to a location in memory N addresses further down, where N is the sizeof whatever ptr points to.
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d928b73b-9b8b-476d-a21a-8565131e653a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d928b73b-9b8b-476d-a21a-8565131e653a</a>
 miszu: (node-&gt;children + i) is this how you get the correct pointer offset?
 Allis: Seems like maybe you want `node.children` instead?
 miszu: children is the starting address of yoru children
 struct: are you writing anything in children + i?
 miszu: well *test should be the children + i
 struct: I dont think you are
 struct: print the address of test
 Allis: @miszu Right, but -&gt; does a dereference, so you may be adding i to the pointed to object rather than the pointer itself.
 struct: and address of node-&gt;children + i
 struct: if they are not the same there is your bug
 miszu: lemme print address
 miszu: not the same address
 miszu: children + 0 is correct
 miszu: children + 1, both have different address
 struct: how does newNodeInit knows the current node?
 miszu: yeah
 miszu: here
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d404a62-3de4-492f-8127-9b4ff8da5f50">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1d404a62-3de4-492f-8127-9b4ff8da5f50</a>
 miszu: NODE_POOL_NEXT starts from 0 and increments by 1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu yup, your mixing some things.  where is your NODE_POOL_NEXT primitive/assignment?
 miszu: what you mean?
 miszu: it gets incremented by the ++
 miszu: and then to make sure it's not out of bound I do the&#160;% SIZE
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if it's a const, what does ++ really do?
 miszu: const static int NODE_POOL_SIZE = 1000000;static Node* NODE_POOL[NODE_POOL_SIZE];static int NODE_POOL_NEXT = 0;
 miszu: it's not const
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh it's just in caps
 therealbeef: urgh, I get a lot of timeouts on the first turn, before my main() even starts. More on -O3 than on -O2. Does the executable not start up fast enough? Never happens in IDE fights, only in battles.
 therealbeef: Also sometimes the first battles still use my previous bot version
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so nodepoolnext is an array index
 miszu: correct
 miszu: I am sure it's something stupid
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you are trying to perform a method -&gt; on an int (nodepoolnext+i)  should throw na error
 PatrickMcGinnisII: an
 struct: does this happen on first turn?
 struct: on how many sims
 miszu: 1st sim
 miszu: like I get an undefined behavior
 miszu: cuz it timeout with 0 error
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, wierd stuff
 struct: so the first sim gets this problem?
 miszu: for sure the issue is here because the node and the + 1 is not pointed at same thing
 miszu: yeah
 miszu: it's the code I am showing you
 miszu: something is off here
 struct: yeah, but if it was for first turn it could be someting else
 PatrickMcGinnisII: this is the problem line  node-&gt;children = NODE_POOL[NODE_POOL_NEXT];
 Astrobytes: I have usually an array of Node* nodes; Allocate first turn to NODE_MAX; thereafter it's:Node* child = &amp;nodes[nextNode];	nextNode++;
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ &amp;
 Astrobytes: don't ask me for debuggin help rn though, 4 cans of Stella and 2 codeine's down so I'm not reliable :P
 miszu: oh... I forgot to dereference?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and + ($i*sizeof(node)) is suspect
 miszu: make sens cuz my array is an array of pointers
 miszu: so pointer pointer
 miszu: no, can't put &amp;
 Astrobytes: when do you create your array?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you have a blank nodepool
 Astrobytes: *Node array
 miszu: at beginning
 miszu: I have an init function
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a2302c5-47fa-4b30-8277-d68eecf02f4b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5a2302c5-47fa-4b30-8277-d68eecf02f4b</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when you create the new node and add it to the list, all you need to return is the array index
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not a pointer to another spot in memory
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it looks like you're allocating new nodes on the fly?
 miszu: not on the fly
 miszu: at turn 1, I create all my nodes
 miszu: then when I need one, I reset values inside my node
 PatrickMcGinnisII: your node() primitive isn't the same size with a variable number of children...how many kids did you allocate pointers for?
 miszu: size has a value of 9
 miszu: 9 children I have basically
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i doesn't know the sizeof the node
 Astrobytes: oh right
 miszu: why you need the size?
 miszu: isn't it automatically?
 Astrobytes: Just checking my Oware code, I malloc(!) 16000000 Nodes first turn, but I initialise the members on use
 miszu: yeah same
 kfsdla: ligma
 Astrobytes: jdsfklsd be relevant at least
 struct: Also it might not be wise to have modulo there
 miszu: yeah could be the modulus the problem
 miszu: I am reading about pointers arithmetic
 Astrobytes: modulo where?
 struct: after you are out of nodes I think the modulo can be problematic yes
 miszu: modulus is just for the next node
 miszu: not for anything else
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu use an addnode routine that you send the temp node * to, and returns the index in the array that it now points to.
 Astrobytes: oh christ I just saw that, don't do that modulo 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: accessing a child pointer that doesn't exist yet is kinda wierd
 miszu: where?
 struct: found out why I was getting so much lag on chrome with threejs
 Astrobytes: plugin?
 struct: I need to disable antialisis
 struct: new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: false });
 struct: antialias*
 Astrobytes: aha
 miszu: ok I think I know why
 miszu: node-&gt;children = NODE_POOL[NODE_POOL_NEXT];
 miszu: this points to a child
 miszu: but node-&gt;children + i doesn't guarantee that the next child is the next address of the beginning of child
 miszu: so better to store the start index
 Astrobytes: well, yeah
 miszu: and access through the index
 Astrobytes: use the index
 miszu:&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: creating a temp node is not what you wanna do anyway, sim the move on the board, set the values of the child and the index of the child now in the parents list of children
 Astrobytes: store childCount as you do
 miszu: node-&gt;numChildren = size;
 miszu: is the child count
 miszu: simulations happen later
 miszu: this code is to expand the node right after the selection step
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in uttt there could be almost 80-9 children
 miszu: 0 to 80 technically
 miszu: but mostle &lt;= 9
 PatrickMcGinnisII: remember if a quadrant is alreaady decided then you can go anywhere
 miszu: true
 Astrobytes: is the teccles heuristic used throughout the game?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but if you are trimming the tree as you go to a max wifth of 9, then fine
 Astrobytes: cause that would shave of a few branches
 Astrobytes: *off
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I don't play UTTT yet
 Astrobytes: Just observational from me game-wise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you should still make the kids, you just don't have to point at them or destruct them
 Doju: Anybody have a deterministic bot in bronze?
 miszu: not teccle yet
 miszu: just 1st move if I am X
 Astrobytes: bronze what Doju?
 miszu: the 4 4
 Astrobytes: k
 Doju: fall challenge
 miszu: but how good is teccle though?
 Astrobytes: Quite effective I hear
 Astrobytes: Doju: probably?
 miszu: Doju I reached silver using determinism
 Astrobytes: If you mean one of us then I got Silver deterministically iirc
 Astrobytes: Some people used random to get out of Wood so maybe still some of those bots are using that code
 miszu: how sad if random moves allow you to go higher in ladders
 Astrobytes: Wood leagues don't really count
 Astrobytes: They're (supposed to be) just there to get a feel for the game
 Zenoscave: what's the teccle_s heuristic
 Astrobytes: Noob-friendliness I believe
 miszu: for any competitions, 1st step is always to make a good engine and foolproof
 miszu: then have fun with different algorithms
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: play a move that forces the other player to play in the same miniboard as you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu btw, I'm working on my MCTS for Bandas, my sim finally works, now testing my eval function and how many sims I can maxout with
 Zenoscave: Oh those are good. 
 miszu: PatrickMcGinnisII that's amazing!
 miszu: I wrote for hours unit tests to test my board states and moves and found 3 bugs
 miszu: now I am confident and can just foccus on my MCTS
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I wrote a library for board translations, found a bug in it yesterday... all over not adding a -1 to an array indexer... cost me hours
 miszu: unit testing&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a freaking -1
 miszu: happens to everyone
 therealbeef: everyone that uses indexes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if (a[x]==   should have been if (a[x-1]==   little stuff can ruin you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er ruin me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darnit, I'm only getting 300 sims
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, ranked 84th with a depth 1 eval
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now lets see how a 300 sim mcts does

 struct: stop
 Norby01: Ok
 Norby01:&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: How long have people been using that heuristic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: went up to 58th, was hoping for better
 therealbeef: which heuristic?
 Zenoscave: same sub move
 therealbeef: is that a heuristic? my minimax bot does it out of its own I noticed&#160;:-)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my 750 sim mcts in UTTT only got me to 888th
 PatrickMcGinnisII: should i stop the depth at like 10, and do an eval so i can get more sims...or leave it alone?
 InsanePyro: anyone knows how to convert a string to float in lua?
 InsanePyro: nevermind i figured out my problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, doubling my sims and stopping at depth10 and keeping the eval performed better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: probably work for uttt as well
 struct: yeah mcts needs a good ammount of sims to do well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just can't get there in php, but a truncated version still performs better than depth 6-8 minmax
 Zenoscave: it seems 9/10 of my first losses were as 2nd player in UTTT is this normal?
 Zenoscave: ~2/3rds of all my losses are 2nd player
 Zenoscave: I think I have a bug
 PatrickMcGinnisII: first player should have an advantage, especially if they play 4 4... but &gt; 66% is a bit much
 Zenoscave: and I counter with 3 3
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf got my CG fix for the day
 isaiahtaylor: Just me or is site really slow right now?
 Zenoscave: plays are slow yes
 IfIHadATail: I'm having problem also
 isaiahtaylor: Does that affect Clash of Code gameplay?
 Zenoscave: possibly
 Zenoscave: but it should effect all the same no?
 Zenoscave: or similarly
 isaiahtaylor: Theorhetically
 IfIHadATail: well I'm guessing it is all times locally and once all are submitted then it evaluates. I harly doubt ping would affect it
 isaiahtaylor: Btw, I'm brand new here... some of you who have been here a while, how would you describe the momentum of this platform? Growing / shrinking? I'm trying it out because I'd like something like this to replace competitive FPS in my life
 IfIHadATail: growing by far
 IfIHadATail: it gets better and better every year
 isaiahtaylor: I'm a bit concerned that yesterday was my first day of play and I'm 3477th in Clash.
 Zenoscave: lately growing. but had a stay of stagnation for a bit
 IfIHadATail: that are doing great thing
 IfIHadATail: things*
 IfIHadATail: well their aren't TON of clashers but the competition can get fierce at the top
 isaiahtaylor: I like competitive FPS because there's a nearly infinite skill ceiling, there's always thousands and thousands of people better than you
 isaiahtaylor: That's good to know
 Zenoscave: CoC is the begining. not infinite ceiling by far but there's room to grow
 isaiahtaylor: ok. how would you order the game modes?
 IfIHadATail: well I mean this isn't like a giant platform that has millions of players so take it for what it is&#160;: )
 Zenoscave: I wouldn't order them. They serve separate purpose
 Zenoscave: But if you're looking for competition try multi's
 Zenoscave: That's a much steeper ascent than CoC
 IfIHadATail: also you don't have to worry about some toxic 12 year old tell you to suck their dick here either :D
 isaiahtaylor: Gotcha. Thanks! Multi's short for...
 Zenoscave: multiplayer
 Zenoscave: the bot leagues
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 isaiahtaylor: Thank you!
 IfIHadATail: yeah the compettative botting is where a lot of the action is at
 isaiahtaylor: Ok sweet. Thanks for answering my noob questions!
 isaiahtaylor: e.g. binary search to find which bot to kill?
 IfIHadATail: depends on the game
 Zenoscave: and league&#160;;)
 IfIHadATail: yeah 
 Zenoscave: starting around silver you typically have the full ruleset and from there it is just advancement of player competitive rank
 Zenoscave: or bronze in the newer games
 isaiahtaylor: Sick. Well thanks much gents. I'm quite hopeful that this can replace CS:GO for me&#160;:)
 isaiahtaylor: I saw the other day that I have like 2500 hours in that game
 isaiahtaylor: And I was like. Well damn, I could've at least been training my coding muscles.
 Zenoscave: It certainly is fun but it has an addicting aspect to it too
 Zenoscave: At some point all things do
 Zenoscave: but yeah nothing too harmful in it. until you do code for CG rather than code for a job... at the job
 isaiahtaylor: Exactly :D
 isaiahtaylor: Legibility out the window!
 isaiahtaylor: My attitude on it is that it's not really about the professional skillset, it's a competitive outlet that happens to flex the right brain muscles.
 IfIHadATail: yeah man coding over CS:GO is by far time way better spent :P
 isaiahtaylor: btw I'm typing on the website... is this also Discord?
 IfIHadATail: yeah the button above this chat actually
 IfIHadATail: but it's not insainely active but people will respond if you write something
 IfIHadATail: but I think it is also just waiting for the right people to join to light that spark

 Insufficient: im sure there are, but it was a nice feeling to be able to do it with DP
 JBM:&#160;:)
 Stilgart: as far as i can remember, the solution can be though as a special case of DP
 Stilgart: but I hardly call it a DP
 Stilgart: Insufficient: almost anyt
 JBM: "a" solution
 Insufficient: and yeah sorry i forgot there is language barrier between solvers
 Stilgart: anything can be done with DP
 Stilgart: JBM: the (expected) solution
 Insufficient: yeah its more just i want to get better at DP so it was nice to be able to do it right, even if in this instance there were simpler solutions
 JBM: try puzzles with the DP tag then&#160;;)
 Insufficient: ooh i see roller coaster has it as a tag, nice thanks
 Insufficient: also i take the tags as loose guidelines, sometimes its good to be original and just try stuff you think might work
 JBM: true that
 SandmanSW96: hey, 
 SandmanSW96: has anyone in here finished 1D Spreadsheet?
 SandmanSW96: monkey crap nevermind lol
 noahkamara: Does anyone know how I can assign a variable like `a = 2`in the Stub Generator?
 Zenoscave: you can't
 Avex: lmao
 jrke: After quest there are quick arrival of new contributions
 jrke: no one in the chat?
 Bob: no
 Bob: well there's still Automaton2000 at least
 Automaton2000: copy and paste it in chat
 Bob: right Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: well you could be the issue
 Bob: aggressive this early in the morning Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: but is it the other way is to do it when i have time
 Bob: no more coffee for you
 jrke: Where can i find pm for csb
 jrke:&#160;?
 Bob: here's Magus's <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 jrke: yeah i read that except magus is there any?
 Bob: you can probably have a look at his pm for FB, since the physics are more or less similar and he published the actual game engine and GA engine
 Bob: and I guess there must be a thread about if in the forum
 jrke: Ah! Thanks./
 Bob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/coders-strike-back-contest-report/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/coders-strike-back-contest-report/</a>
 jrke: you are 328 in csb right
 Bob: probably something like that
 Bob: but I was in the top tier when they introduced the leagues, I'm not sure my code would make it to legend today
 jrke: You are in legend 328 in legend right
 Bob: yes
 jrke: curently im 119 in legend aiming top 100.
 Bob: nice
 NIghthawk: :innocent:
 _Feri_: oh hi mark
 jrke: why after having 38 upvotes "ATARI GO" is not approved by anyone
 Bob: n oidea
 Bob: possibly because few people took the time to develop an AI on it to actually test it thoroughly

 hem123: .
 AntiSquid: DevilSnare what's that about? @_@
 AntiSquid: which puzzle are you doing?
 AntiSquid: i didnt test atari go and dont like the rules that much
 VYCanisMajoris: this article seems to be bugged

 VYCanisMajoris: the end is not displayed
 Allis: *Finally* 5th in Clash.  I think I can leave now. :sweat_smile:
 Allis: Thank you all for being lovely.
 Mani_Code: hi
 Jiangxing: ...
 Aditiya12: did you know how to finish Power of Thor?
 Zenoscave: VYCanisMajoris I have the same issue
 Zenoscave: Can a Classic Puzzle Descript contain links or images or any markdown?
 [CG]Thibaud: this is a known bug on the blog unfortunately&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: Seems to be a js memory issue, no?
 J.C: hi
 Astrobytes: The blog has been mostly inaccessible for me recently
 JayBeAl: why cant i see my tutorial tree on my home screen?
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave 01:48PMCan a Classic Puzzle Descript contain links or images or any markdown?
 Zenoscave: Hi eulerscheZahl
 Zenoscave: thanks
 Zenoscave: I figured that out too
 Zenoscave: i="print(f'i={chr(34)}'+i+f'{chr(34)};'+i)";print(f'i={chr(34)}'+i+f'{chr(34)};'+i)
 JBM: a classic
 Zenoscave: JBM have you seen Mame's uroburo?
 JBM: probably
 JBM: i've read a lot of quines, quine generators and friends
 JBM: wrote my fair share too
 Astrobytes: I just posted that last night for someone, incidentally
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">https://github.com/mame/quine-relay</a>
 JBM: yes i know that one
 JBM: from the link only
 Zenoscave: It's my favorite
 Zenoscave: It really is a worthwhile favorite
 Scarfield: why, does it have any use? other than being an interesting idea
 JBM: it's got some unexpected applications to infosec
 Zenoscave: It possibly could be used in obfuscating code
 Zenoscave: Ah JBM beat me to it
 Zenoscave: _.rb is cool too
 JBM: if you squint properly, kernighan's trusting code trojan is a quine
 Zenoscave: I'm not familiar with that one by name
 Scarfield: cool, well i guess everything has a use, its just a matter of figuring out where
 Zenoscave: Galois would agree
 Zenoscave: but be pissed to agree
 JBM: was ken thompson
 JBM: my bad
 JBM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210</a>
 Zenoscave: is that the original unix compiler compiler backdoor?
 JBM: it's the paper about it
 Zenoscave: I never knew there was a paper
 Zenoscave: TIL
 Zenoscave: I changed the digital output for Plouffe Pi, and made in ready for approval btw
 JBM: oh good to know
 JBM: i hope it can wait for me to solve it before it goes
 Zenoscave: I think the difficulty should be hard, even with the wiki link. You gotta know some intrinsics in your language to get floating point modular arithmetic
 Zenoscave: I checked a few different normal suspects for solvability
 JBM: can you make the formula narrower?
 Zenoscave: I wrote it and my first 3 attempted solutions were awful
 Zenoscave: Yeah will do.
 JBM: mmm not too easily&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: I removed what spaceI could without sacrificing readability
 Zenoscave: is that better?
 JBM: i don't see a change&#160;:(
 JBM: must be some cache thing
 JBM: if it's narrower, it's probably better
 Zenoscave: It doesn't overflow, and I put a text link in the description to the original wiki page
 Zenoscave: should be enough
 AmarjitSingh: Allis please leave
 AmarjitSingh: get out
 ad99526: Allis teach us python tricks
 baniksaurabh: Hello World
 Zenoscave: AmarjitSingh ad99526 this is the general chat. not just your clash , FYI&#160;:)
 AmarjitSingh: ohhh
 AntiSquid: ya, don't wash your dirty laundry in public space
 JBM: we don't want no stinking python trix
 Schwase: yo i just did the european rugby cup challenge and man that was satisfying to solve that one
 Zenoscave: Nice Schwase
 [CG]Thibaud: it's Bob 's puzzle isn't it
 Zenoscave: TataMas_o
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm confusing with another one my bad
 SPDene: JBM you can "golf" that by removing the two "not"s: "we don't want no stinking python trix" -&gt; "we do want stinking python trix"&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: SPDene I like your golfing ways
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63NCvjX7X8E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63NCvjX7X8E</a>
 JBM: Zenoscave: not sure why you mention FP modular arithmetic--i thought the whole point of the spigot was to do it all in ints
 Zenoscave: JBM maybe that's a different aproach. Perhaps a better one&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: 16^(n-k)mod(8*k-1) but you need remainder
 JBM: but n-k&gt;=0
 Zenoscave: rounding on the remaining places is needed
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl I love that show
 eulerscheZahl: it has way too few episodes
 Zenoscave: sadly
 Zenoscave: JBM n-k  is not always &gt; 0. Right?
 JBM: (almost?) all your pairs have a bigger validator than test
 Zenoscave: Should I switch some?
 JBM: or all&#160;;)
 JBM: else you risk the usual "my code passes test but not validate whine whine whine"
 DomiKo: ehhh 2 days for mars lander
 DomiKo: time for 200 chars
 eulerscheZahl: you'll have to do move golfing after that to complete the track
 DomiKo: move golfing?
 Astrobytes: Think he meant "more"&#160;;)
 DomiKo: ohhh
 jacek: mode?
 DomiKo: i hope i can do it
 DomiKo: then i guess i will go back to MarLander Optimalization
 Astrobytes: I spent a lot of time golfing on Sunday. Until my head was hurting.
 dbdr: DomiKo: move golfing = save your fuel in optim mode, I think&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: *more
 eulerscheZahl: i was golfing today as well
 eulerscheZahl: down from 650kB to 350kB approximately
 dbdr: a 100K character golf submission would be a nice troll :D
 Allis: I was thinking how great it would be if CG supported the Whitespace language and accidentally only counted printing characters for golf. XD
 jrke: Anybody finished all paths yet?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: but unlike you I only gained 1 level in that process
 jrke: You gained 1 cause your level is high i gained 4 level and last quest is remaining
 jrke: i.e. last 600xp
 dbdr: Allis: CG used to ignore whitespace
 dbdr: people found ways to abuse that
 dbdr: was before my time, but saw it mentioned in the forum somewhere
 jrke: is there any pm for csb except magus one?
 JBM: as they should
 JBM: ignoring ws is very naive
 JBM: the forum's full of them jrke
 eulerscheZahl: did you open the overview page of CSB @jrke?
 jrke: Overview page?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 eulerscheZahl: LEARN ALGORITHMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PUZZLE
 jrke: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and external resources
 dbdr: there's still a need to write the converter in non-whitespace
 eulerscheZahl: the link collection even got an update to account for later improvements
 dbdr: was that really profitable?
 JBM: write a "golf me in ws" puzzle and find out
 dbdr: not sure I get it. the question is the size of the "ws interpreter"
 JBM: that's judgeable
 JBM: adding to the list of stuff i'll do later
 dbdr: "later"&#160;:)
 JBM: you know the one
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:)
 JBM: how's yours :p
 Allis: @dbdr Why's "ws interpreter" in quotes there?
 Allis: I guess probably you meant that you wouldn't necessarily have to interpret Whitespace; you could translate it to something else.
 DomiKo: wow
 Allis: Anyway, best esolang, bar none. :sweat_smile:
 DomiKo: i can even read data
 DomiKo: in golf&#160;:(
 Allis: Hm?
 DomiKo: and anothing else...
 dbdr: yes, does not have to be ws
 dbdr: wslang :D
 JBM: are optim puzzle replays publicable? (as in, can they be set to be public through game configuration?)
 eulerscheZahl: you can share a replay using the 3 dots below the viewer. by default they are private

 aCat: New optim game from me&#160;;-)
 aCat: NRPA variants should be the best, but we will see ^^
 jacek: is this nested monte carlo thing?
 jacek: OupsAn error occurred (#510): "An error has occurred during compilation/execution.".
 Scarfield: ^ happens 50%ish for me 2 with default code in c++ as well
 aCat: hmm
 aCat: it worked before making public
 aCat: gimme a sec
 Astrobytes: Hey this is a conspiracy, you got Radek to approve it already! :P
 Scarfield: i want to be paid as well!
 aCat: he was not paid ;p
 Astrobytes: :smirk_cat:
 aCat: OK, works for me now
 aCat: please check
 DomiKo: for me it work
 aCat: nice, thanks&#160;;-)
 Scarfield: seems good, no errors for 12 tests
 Astrobytes: yep, seems OK so far
 DomiKo: 20 tests OK
 aCat: strange thing, i reupload the same build
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: ok thx
 Astrobytes: Just a CG thing I guess. The code moves in mysterious ways&#160;;)
 aCat: jacek its similar to nested monte carlo, but best approaches learn move policy along the way
 Astrobytes: Have you got a paper on that? Never heard of it
 aCat: tristan cazenave got quite a few publications with this game as a testbed
 aCat: me - not 
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~bnegrevergne/webpage/documents/2017_nrpa.pdf">https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~bnegrevergne/webpage/documents/2017_nrpa.pdf</a>
 DomiKo: i guess
 aCat: this is upload for lecture exercise
 aCat: yeah, this one and a few more
 aCat:&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: cool, thanks DomiKo
 aCat: At least I'm not spoiling you officially :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Good work btw aCat
 aCat: I'm just starting
 aCat: got list of &gt;30 puzzles/optims in mind
 Astrobytes: Oh great to hear!
 aCat: probably &lt;10 for this lecture I'm preparing
 aCat: took quite a while to remember myself how to work with CG SDK
 aCat: no it should be faster
 aCat: (I hope)
 eulerscheZahl: the fun begins if you want to do something in JS directly rather than using the SDK
 eulerscheZahl: or combine these two
 aCat: I probably don't want to touch JS, I have no idea how it works&#160;;]
 JBM: do something in JS and conspire to elude the SDK
 eulerscheZahl: took me 2 days to figure it out
 eulerscheZahl: still not working with groups
 eulerscheZahl: aCat the rules say The score of an action removing a region of size n is (n-2)2.
 eulerscheZahl: but the website gives n points
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i'm stupid
 eulerscheZahl: the block with size 4 gives the same score with both metrics, ignore me
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i got a negative score of -283&#160;:/
 Scarfield: on the website, or in the CG puzzle? :p
 dbdr: sum of squares equal to -283?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/eng/games/samegame/lx/play">http://www.js-games.de/eng/games/samegame/lx/play</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i guess -1000 for not clearing the board
 eulerscheZahl: while CG gives +1000 for doing so
 dbdr: positive thinking "+1"
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: -271 with random clicking
 DomiKo: -1425 hmmm
 dbdr: you win
 DomiKo: :smiley:
 Scarfield: this will end up like with people trying to get the lowest possible score on 2048
 aCat: yes the score for the endgame on the site is different
 eulerscheZahl: -49 now...
 eulerscheZahl: not sure what that means
 aCat: but I keep it constistent with the papers
 dbdr: what's your thoughts on offline solving?
 aCat: probably its a penalty for the tiles that are left
 eulerscheZahl: did you also try some algos from papers?
 aCat: in general to learn for this game - or you want to just hardcode strategies for these testcases&#160;:&gt;/ 
 eulerscheZahl: and of course offline solving will be a thing if players try hard
 aCat: sorry not yet - I just got the Flat monte carlo
 aCat: I will do this
 aCat: but it's not as a priority
 aCat: first other games / prepare slides ;p
 eulerscheZahl: i'll wait till tomorrow evening: topcoder marathonand then decided what to play
 aCat: wanna spoliers on what will be ext&#160;:&gt;?
 eulerscheZahl: ~ ls /extls: cannot access '/ext': No such file or directory
 aCat: *next
 aCat:&#160;:*
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, tell usor ask CG for an optim contest
 aCat: next puzzle&#160;;-)
 aCat: JPS-related 
 eulerscheZahl: depending on how original / how much literature
 aCat: these are not contributions for a real contests
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPS</a>
 aCat: I will definitely try some day
 eulerscheZahl: hmm...
 dbdr: jps - Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool&#160;:)
 aCat: :D:D:D
 aCat: pathfinding ;p
 eulerscheZahl: Jump point search?
 Astrobytes: jump point search
 Astrobytes: damn you toad
 dbdr: but my best was on Jyväskylän Seudun Palloseura
 aCat: aaaad - eouler got a kiss
 aCat: *euler
 aCat: maybe he will finally be a princess&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: and your students get grades on it or at least bonus points?
 Scarfield: lol
 aCat: no this was extremally stupid approach to labs
 aCat: i plan to change it dyrastically
 aCat: implement some of the proposed methods, do some parameter testing, show some plots what works best
 eulerscheZahl: beat dbdr
 aCat: some bonus for good results yes - but not the entire task based on that
 aCat: I was stupid beck in the days
 aCat: *back
 aCat: (I still am but at least slightly less I hope)
 dbdr: damn, then I can't pass aCat's test
 aCat: ok
 aCat: especially for you dbdr
 aCat: greater equal dbdr score
 aCat: :D
 dbdr: easy :D
 aCat: ^^'
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes still looking for stupid chats? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tq13gn">https://prnt.sc/tq13gn</a>
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 DomiKo: haha
 Astrobytes: random
 dbdr: why is there a loop aCat?
 Astrobytes: I've still got my c*** screenshot
 Scarfield: dont tease people who type-stutters, thats just mean
 aCat: you mean not just read the line?
 dbdr: # game loopwhile True:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/3i9BsQJ">https://imgur.com/a/3i9BsQJ</a>
 aCat: oh damn
 aCat: stupid cat :D
 aCat: thanks fopr pointing that out
 Astrobytes: bahaha quality content from Automaton there
 dbdr: not a big deal but confusing
 dbdr: actually, would it make sense to allow printing the actiona 1 by 1?
 Astrobytes: aCat has a thing about semicolon-separated commands :P
 dbdr: but the timeout would be different...
 dbdr: would be more beginner friendly I think
 Scarfield: ^
 dbdr: for a greedy algo for instance
 Scarfield: yea no need for game mechanics, just find current largest area
 eulerscheZahl: only downside: how to handle the timelimit with multiple turns?
 aCat: yep - that's the case
 aCat: timelimits will be awful then
 dbdr: who care,s, do the search offline&#160;;)
 aCat: In every case not what I intended
 dbdr: is there any way to cleanly avoid it?
 eulerscheZahl: you can't upload an optim game and expect everyone to solve it online&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the bulls and cows has random validators. but i wouldn't call that "clean"
 dbdr: randomized validators are more problematic
 Scarfield: for someone who wants to search, the mechanics will have to be implemented anyway. So maybe a 1st turn time limit of 20s, for the remaining turns 20s/150
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: the total time is 30s max
 eulerscheZahl: 20s + 50ms * 200 frames
 dbdr: there was one idea: make it a multi
 dbdr: with randomized testcases
 eulerscheZahl: it just feels miscategorized then
 aCat: dbdr i fixed the gameloop
 eulerscheZahl: it's you vs the puzzle, no bot interaction
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: no interaction, but competition
 eulerscheZahl: i got the point
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't want to see an optim puzzle in the multiplayer section
 Allis: I just blind-submitted. Felt so good.
 Scarfield: remember to protect yourself
 dbdr: the line is blurry
 dbdr: STC is almost an optim, no?
 aCat: yah you got STC for this
 eulerscheZahl: my bot misses the interaction part mostly. but i think i could gain a few points if i would handle it
 eulerscheZahl: at least i build a high tower in the center to make digging easier
 dbdr: submit is pretty long
 dbdr: even though I do no search
 xlr4829: hello
 AntiSquid: duck hunt without the graphics&#160;:( 
 MSmits: isn't just a sad dude shooting at a broken tv?
 MSmits: that
 hphadi: hi
 hphadi: anti squid
 hphadi: im why
 Scarfield: :exclamation::squid:
 hphadi: yStay in my presence
 hphadi: pleas
 hphadi: He brought me back to the world
 hem123: what is the best way to store incoming data in python. Pandas dataframe?
 Scarfield: depends on the data, what puzzle?
 hem123: like for example code royale
 hem123: storing all the side
 Scarfield: there are many ways to do it, an array of objects, 2D array for each kind of site and so on, i dont think there is any need to use pandas for it
 Zenoscave: Anyone have a goog scanline Floodfill?
 FreezeFlare: Nope.
 FreezeFlare: Can anybody tell me how to make my own code?
 AlmostM: Do you mean how to run code on your computer instead of on the site?

 AntiSquid: better use anaconda / jupyter @_@
 AntiSquid: pycharm costs money, it looks nice but ...
 DomiKo: pychars isn't free?
 DomiKo: pycharm*
 AlmostM: there is a free version
 AlmostM: but any editor would work
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid Hi
 Zenoscave: DomiKo it is free to users with a edu email
 Zenoscave: At least the full version is
 DomiKo: kk
 aCat: DomiKo i'm pretty sure our uwr mail sgould give you free pycharm
 Zenoscave: Hi aCat long time
 Zenoscave: I saw something about IEEE 2020 competetion
 aCat: hi Zeno - seen my optim puzzle?
 Zenoscave: when did it start?
 Zenoscave: I have not
 DomiKo: yes. that's why I thought it's free

 Zenoscave: Looking now
 aCat: CEC already ended Coac won again but some progress had been made
 Zenoscave: I like it!
 aCat: for COG deadline in a few days if you want to send something&#160;:-)
 Zenoscave: COG?
 aCat: I like that you like it
 aCat: Conference on Games
 aCat: former conference on coimputational intelligence and games
 Zenoscave: Will do! Might try and do some convex pareto optim
 aCat: :curious_cat:
 aCat: for SameGame what publication-wise works best are some nested variants of MC, rollout policy adaptations etc
 Zenoscave: no for COG
 aCat: I know you answered for cog
 aCat: I really like to hearthat
 Astrobytes: CEC was LoCaM again aCat? Did Coac try something different?
 aCat: just upgrades his weights or something
 Astrobytes: An eval tweak! Meh, hardly groundbreaking :D
 Zenoscave: When is deadline? Aug 1st?
 AntiSquid: hi Zenoscave
 AntiSquid: 2020 has been so weird
 AntiSquid: how are the conferences held aCat&#160;? do you go in person to CEC / COG&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i saw some contests that normally rewarded travel grants now struggling to find ideas for other prizes :D
 AntiSquid: (aicrowd contests)
 AntiSquid: aCat&#160;? Automaton2000 ping aCat
 Automaton2000: you put a space in the end
 Zenoscave: does coac play on CG as well?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, think he was top 20 or something in LoCaM
 AntiSquid: thought game of go was a multi, ugh nvm then&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: No, Atari Go was the only Go multi so far
 AntiSquid: we have that on CG? didn't see it
 Zenoscave: not approved yet I believe
 Astrobytes: Didn't get approved in time
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355</a>
 Astrobytes: jacek has a bot, not sure why he didn't approve or reject, trictrac too
 aCat: AntiSquid no its damn online
 aCat: waste conferences
 aCat: for me its pointless, I benefit from them only by talking to people and listening talks
 AntiSquid: i joined some meetups online, but honestly it's not the same as meeting people in person 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, can imagine. Might as well be a podcast.
 AntiSquid: the upside is that i can join meetups everywhere in the world now because people host online :D
 aCat: more hours in front of the screen yeah that is what i love
 aCat: yeah, but CEC was a mess for me - I din't attend anything and if I wanted it wasnt working
 aCat: cause they didnt give you all vides to watch but pretend this is a conference for real and made proper timeslots etc
 aCat: my (and radek's) opinin - awful
 Astrobytes: Seems a bit silly 
 AntiSquid: tryharding
 AntiSquid: "if we imagine hard enough it will be a real conference"
 Astrobytes: Cancellation and just sharing info would have been easier and more cost-effective for all I would imagine
 inoryy: aCat have you "participated" in ICLR, ICML, etc?
 inoryy: seemed fine
 aCat: nope
 aCat: last weeks: watching AI and Games channel, making this damn CG puzzle, making lecture plan
 aCat: and pretending to write publication on a strict deadline:P
 inoryy: oh, love that channel!
 aCat: not watching any true conferences&#160;:/
 inoryy: what about EEML? it was "virtually" in poland&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: AI and Games, the Scottish guy?
 aCat: yep
 aCat: I'm not much in true machine learning inoryy
 Astrobytes: Yeah I like that channel, being a fellow Scot and all that :P
 aCat: rather search and stuff 
 Astrobytes: Anyway, catch you guys later, take care and gn
 aCat: ok folks need to go to sleep finally
 aCat: yep, you too
 DomiKo: gn
 AntiSquid: i thought cats are nocturnal
 TheSpiffiest: So I'm going to create a contribution... can you guys suggest what kind of challenge it should be? Puzzle vs Code Clash?
 TheSpiffiest: I think it's simple, but then I know how it works.
 SPDene: how long will it take to solve?
 TheSpiffiest: Given a random number generator that makes a number between 0 and 1, calculate pi
 TheSpiffiest: Took me about 10 minutes, but I don't know if that's because I like math or not
 TheSpiffiest: I'm thinking code clash
 AntiSquid: make an asteroid shooter multi
 AntiSquid: and you get item drops from the rocks that give you upgrades
 TheSpiffiest: The concept is simple - you generate a crap ton of random numbers, then figure out if the distance is less than 1, then compare the numbers inside vs outside 
 TheSpiffiest: lol
 TheSpiffiest: I think Optimal Tower Defense I would be more fun
 TheSpiffiest: I want to start with something simple. Does that seem like a 15 minute problem&#160;?
 SPDene: if a clash takes more than 5 minutes for someone familiar with the topic, that would suggest puzzle to me... but counting the ratio of &lt;= 1 | &gt; 1 results doesn't sounds like it would take more than 5 mins to code IMO 
 TheSpiffiest: the hardest part was figuring out I had to do the whole + and - not just 0 to 1, but -1,-1 to 1,1
 TheSpiffiest: after that yeah, it just typing it on
 TheSpiffiest: *in
 TheSpiffiest: I'll try code clash and see what happens
 TheSpiffiest: but how would you know it worked and they didn't just return "math.pi"
 SPDene: yeah - that's a problem
 TheSpiffiest: it's an interesting challenge, but the coding isn't the challenge I guess... it's thinking of the solution.
 SPDene: I was about to ask: what are you expecting to use to generate random numbers? do all languages have a random function, or is it going to be impossible for people coding in (say) Bash&#160;?
 TheSpiffiest: ah, interesting. Bash has $RANDOM or /dev/random 
 TheSpiffiest: but the later would require file input
 TheSpiffiest: and that's 0 to 32767, not 0 to 1 so you would have to code a function to adjust it, or offset your unit circle
 TheSpiffiest: I assume languages have random, but don't know
 SPDene: yeah, I think you need to provide a list of random numbers, then (using those) calculate an inexact value of pi... so the "right" answer (using those randoms) is 3.14158, not 3.14159
 TheSpiffiest: Ah, that could work... then the input values really didn't matter. The more numbers you get the more detail you could calculate.
 TheSpiffiest: Even bash could do it
 TheSpiffiest: It would be nightmare in reverse mode
 TheSpiffiest:&#160;:)
 SPDene: and that could be a nice demo of how many points you need to get 3 places of precision / 4 places  / 5 places ...
 TheSpiffiest: Neato... I could do the same for Newtons Method
 TheSpiffiest: force people to learn math
 TheSpiffiest: Coolness. Thank you. Doing all these coding interviews and my head is full of algorithms and stuff.

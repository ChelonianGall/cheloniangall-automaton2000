 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Can someone tell me if I typed out step 2 in the "expert rules" of CSB correctly?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:     vx *= throttle*(cos(angle))
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: (I'm making a function to predict position ahead of time)
 dbdr: I think there might be rounding involved
 dbdr: the best is to test it
 DaNinja: angle is in radians?
 DaNinja: x = round(x);vx = (int)(vx * FRICTION);
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Oh
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: No the friction comes after
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ok thx for the last part!
 DaNinja: yep, friction and rounding come after

 DaNinja: looks ok
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Ty!
 DaNinja: :thumbsup:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I also made the input a list and the output a list so I can return the value into the function again and again to predict successive turns
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Inside a loop presumable
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: presumably*

 IcyStar: Hello, I have a question about Coders Strike back. I noticed that the position of the pod passed as input (x,y) is not the current pos on the playscreen, but rather it is the previous pos of the pod. Is this normal&#160;?
 dbdr: IcyStar, I think it's just that the screen shows the state after applying your action for this turn
 IcyStar: oh really&#160;? I find that really disturbing..
 IcyStar: I'm not sure if that impacts my code or not. I use previous positions of the pod, and so it makes me confused as to what is the previous..
 Marchete: or maybe your are printing before reading the new data...
 jacek: or servers are lagging
 Nodirbek: hi , there

 MSmits: such good news
 MSmits: I wake up to read Illedan can reproduce. The world needs more little Illedans
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: morning&#160;:)
 dbdr: \o
 Illedan: Lol
 Illedan: I will fix stuff tonight dbdr. So keep finding things&#160;:)
 Illedan: I'll move it WIP
 Illedan: dbdr, do you solve the 1 food testcase within 25000 moves?
 dbdr: nope
 dbdr: not 1 and 2
 Illedan: Good&#160;:)
 dbdr: you? all but 1?
 Illedan: Not 1,2 or 3&#160;:( But my code is 80 lines long and I know what to do. Just gotta fix that viewer for some demanding user first :P
 dbdr: 3 I solve with a bad score (7k)
 Illedan: What is your total score on submit?
 dbdr: 569074
 Illedan: 60k more than me :D
 dbdr: for 2 I had 508. so it's almost surely solvable
 dbdr: 1 I have doubts
 Illedan: I can increase the move count, but I think it is nice with a challenge like this
 dbdr: no, it's definitely better if it's a challenge to solve some
 dbdr: bigger sense of progression
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: Maybe lower it? xD
 dbdr: why not?
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: 20k?
 Illedan: 15k?
 dbdr: yeah
 Illedan: How many steps do you have on 3 now?
 dbdr: 17850
 Illedan: 18k?
 Illedan: ok
 Illedan: I can set limit to 17800 :smirk:
 dbdr: :P
 dbdr: deal
 Illedan: I'll fix later. bye
 dbdr: ttyl
 seshoumara: how is my CoC score adjusted after one play?
 jacek: probably trueskill algorithm
 dGrayCoder: is there any tutorial for any turn based challenge?
 dGrayCoder: I want to know how I can represent a game state in form of node so I would be able to apply some search algorithm.
 jacek: try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 jacek: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/48392/bitboard-for-the-3x3-tic-tac-toe-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/48392/bitboard-for-the-3x3-tic-tac-toe-game</a>
 dbdr: class State { ... }and a methodState::update(action)
 jrke: snake game is easily solvable but decreasing move is main motive
 dbdr: yes, it's an optim&#160;:)
 jrke: but i think atleast it shouldn't be that easy to solve
 jrke: i can solve many just under simp logicle
 jacek: nah, 2048 is easier to 'solve'
 jrke: atleast width and height both should be odd to prevent that very easy solving
 dbdr: you can't solve 1 this way&#160;;)
 dbdr: not enough steps
 jrke: yeah 1, 2, 3
 dbdr: number of steps will be reduced further a bit
 jrke: cool then
 Gabbinetto: i use python3 and this variablen=[int(input()) for i in range(3)]doesn't take the inputs and says its equal to none
 Gabbinetto: what do i do
 dGrayCoder: so for a turn based game like the 2021 spring challenge, how should I apply a search algorithm for finding the next move? Should I simulate opponents moves too?
 MSmits: did you try search algorithms on simple board games before?
 dGrayCoder: I have only done minimax on tictactoe
 jacek: yes you need to simulate the game, make move and undo move
 dGrayCoder: I have used a*, dijkstra on some other problems
 MSmits: well spring challenge 2021 is not hard to simulate, but has some complications using search
 MSmits: I used beamsearch, some used a form of mcts
 MSmits: you can get to legend with either
 MSmits: but it's not that easy to do
 MSmits: thats why i ask about the simple boardgames. 
 MSmits: Beamsearch is doable for spring 2021 I think, but if you've never done mcts, dont start there
 MSmits: (better on uttt)
 dGrayCoder: utt?
 MSmits: oh i thought you knew, you said TTT, but you meant normal TTT
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe</a>
 dGrayCoder: can you apply beam search on ttt?
 MSmits: it's one of the easiest places to practice getting a mcts working. The only issue with it, is that it's hard to see what a good move is (for a human). 
 MSmits: dGrayCoder no
 MSmits: beamsearch is mostly used on optims
 MSmits: it involves ignoring the opponent mostly
 MSmits: and finding the best sequence of moves for yourself
 MSmits: and since optims are single player, it makes more sens there
 MSmits: sense
 MSmits: in spring 2021 you can to some degree, ignore opponent. It's not perfect by a long shot, but it works somewhat
 jrke: my spring 2021 is still without any opponent interference
 dGrayCoder: what is optims?
 MSmits: optimization
 MSmits: get the most score out of the problem
 dGrayCoder: I see
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization</a>
 dGrayCoder: thank you very much it helped.
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: if you see people talk about snake here, that's an optim in development
 jacek: or it could be python
 Illedan: jrke, true. I can make the width/height randomized with some odd maps?
 Illedan: Would actually give something to the game
 Illedan: Just +-1 of the current
 Westicles: Anyone know the story on thor golf?  Looks like new validator and maybe a bash update or something?
 BlaiseEbuth: Another mean trick from the French...
 Westicles: Yes, very devious :P

 seshoumara: where can I find the weekly puzzles?
 BlaiseEbuth: Via the notifications, or by clicking the coresponding item on the quest map.
 geppoz: question from noob to experts in ruby
 geppoz: about if conditional
 geppoz: example:
 geppoz: { puts n; exit} if n&gt;1
 geppoz: that gives a big error
 geppoz: puts n if n&gt;1
 geppoz: that works fine
 geppoz: question: how is defined a block of code that needs to be tratead as a single entity?
 JohnPotter895: anh em việt nam ơiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
 BlaiseEbuth: No.
 BlaiseEbuth: Speak english on this chan.
 seshoumara: the quest map directs me to the current puzle of the week, how do I access the previous ones?
 BlaiseEbuth: Puzzles of the week are puzzles already present on the site, so you can find them back by browsing CodinGame. But there's no history of which ones was pow...
 seshoumara: there was a list some 1-2 years ago, guess they refactored it, ok, thanks
 Pythonista_TN: hey guys, If a clash competition is complete can I have access to the problem statement?

 pyprog: there is a bug running around inside my computer
 pyprog: should i run a debugger?
 Illedan: Yo
 MrAnderson: yo-yo
 struct: hi
 Illedan: So, how should I create this API from Snake to JS :thinking:
 Illedan: Send all the moves?
 struct: Yes
 Illedan: Send coordinates with food and snake?
 struct: you can check chess or try angle catch
 Illedan: Then I need the engine both places
 struct: I would say send moves only
 struct: yes
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: Chess has it both places?
 struct: you dont need to check for legal moves on js
 struct: because the java one will handle that
 Illedan: Indeed
 jacek: oO
 Illedan: But I need to send the spawned food too
 Illedan: Or should I keep the seed logic in JS too?
 struct: its your call
 struct: if you send the food its more data
 Illedan: I guess I can send all moves as:N10W3ESS
 struct: that should help yeah
 struct: max moves is currently 25k right?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Will be 17000
 Illedan: And I wonder about having some boards with odd sizes
 struct: if you just send the moves to the js module the replay size will be way under 40k
 struct: with the module you can also have all the frames if you want
 struct: instead of teleporting the snake
 Illedan: I want to speed move :D
 Illedan: When you do many each frame
 Illedan: 50 moves? =&gt; 1 sec / 50 each move
 eulerscheZahl: still waiting for approval Illedan?
 jacek: lets approve without making the bot
 struct: once i finish breakthrough i might make a bot
 struct: I dont know what to play next anyways
 jacek: still obsessed with breakthrough eh

 eulerscheZahl: you have so many smurfs
 eulerscheZahl: ask nulte

 eulerscheZahl: but first you have to reach top3
 eulerscheZahl: that's not easy&#160;;)
 jacek: nulte is noob

 eulerscheZahl: you mean on a regular contest?
 struct: yes
 struct: sorry i havent rested properly due to breakthrough
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the next contest will scramble chances of winning
 struct: hope not
 eulerscheZahl: ++
 jacek: next contest? the non-multi one?
 struct: 20 shirts top 20 + 20 shirts for top 100 would not be that bad
 eulerscheZahl: the undetermined one
 struct: but if its all randomized i would say no
 eulerscheZahl: what are you talking about?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even thinking about tshirts or whatever. just the format (bot vs escape)
 struct: ah
 struct: my answer remains the same&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: fantastic bits had tshirts for top10 + 50 random winners in top250

 eulerscheZahl: you got your fair share at this point&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: when did you change your country from Hungary to Spain? but still Budapest
 martinpapa69: I moved to spain so i can participate in the private contest
 eulerscheZahl: really? :D
 martinpapa69: might move back to hungary later idk
 struct: moved or changed the flag?
 eulerscheZahl: CG will never be able to disprove one of them
 martinpapa69: yo soy espanol

 struct: darkhorse64 how do you know that breakthrough may only last up to 209 moves? I can't seem to find any info about it.
 jacek: :thinking:
 jrke: maybe i think an estimated
 jrke: like (8*8 + 8*7)*2
 jrke: something like tha
 jrke: t
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Stupid reverse clashes -.-
 struct: you are doing clashes?
 jrke: nope
 Illedan: *clash
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: so csipcsirip = Marchet e confirmed?
 RoboStac: struct - every move is going forwards so 209 would be moving all pieces onto row 7/2 before one is forced to move onto the end row and end the game
 struct: thanks robo
 Marchete: lol
 jacek: oh my
 Marchete: he changed to spain
 jrke: thats how i tried to estimate - 8pawns at bottom can go to top in 8 moves which is 8*8 and 8 at second row will take 7 moves to reach top so 8*7 and for players *2, maybe i am wrong
 RoboStac: only one pawn can do 8 moves
 RoboStac: but yeah, 16*7+16*6 + 1
 jacek: lets ask those who approve breakthrough how did they test that
 jrke: yeah robo is right i think16*7 = 11216*6 = 96=208 +1 = 209 if it fits
 martinpapa69: he *moved to Spain
 martinpapa69: I thought if I work on Marchete's code, it could be beneficial if i moved closer to him
 MSmits: good thinking
 jacek: then we all should move to canada
 MSmits: to be near RockyMullet!
 BlaiseEbuth: Caribou powa!
 reCurse: Why would they limit the countries that can participate? I can't find a single good reason
 MSmits: maybe this is something they leave up to the company that is sponsoring
 MSmits: they may be hiring in some
 BlaiseEbuth: Participate to&#160;?
 reCurse: So they wouldn't be interested in expat candidates? lol
 reCurse: Not to mention people with no interest in a job with the right country can still do it
 reCurse: Like I said, not a single good reason
 MSmits: no idea, but I think it's not CG making this decision
 reCurse: I don't care who's making the decision, I think it's a dumb one regardless who makes it
 MSmits: possibly you are correct&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 struct: its not like having people from other countries will affect anything, if they want to recruit people from the countries listed they can still do it
 reCurse: Maybe CG is charging per country now
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks, chat log.
 reCurse: Someone with a twitter should @ them
 MSmits: a twitter? 
 jacek: you dont do twitter?
 reCurse: No

 reCurse: I'm off social media in general

 MSmits: mmh i miss benchmarking
 MSmits: no idea how much improvement i am making vs mikla unless i submit repeatedly
 reCurse: Glad that stupid change didn't happen when I was still active
 MSmits: I guess you can still do it with a large time between games
 Wontonimo: what's the change&#160;?  (i'm late to the conversation)
 Wontonimo: that is preventing benchmarking?
 reCurse: 3-4 times longer than before
 Wontonimo: ah yes, managing server costs
 reCurse: They never mentioned that
 Wontonimo: what did they mention?
 reCurse: They said "so people participating in contests don't get slow servers because of people benchmarking"
 reCurse: And we know what happened
 BlaiseEbuth: Benchmarking performance is a 5% concern...
 martinpapa69: ye, how many ppl use cgbenchmark in a contest, like 30?
 reCurse: Probably more than that
 MSmits: that's not negligible though
 reCurse: The real issue is that if you prevent them from doing that, what do you think is going to happen
 reCurse: More submits
 MSmits: yes, thats whats happening for me now
 reCurse: Then things practically came to a halt because of all the submits
 reCurse: :clap:
 Astrobytes: There is logic, then there is CG logic
 reCurse: Anyway enough negativity from me today
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah that's really surprising, since CG always took smart decisions until now... :thinking:

 Astrobytes: It is if you want it to be. It also happens to be fun.
 dwarfie: clashs are useless ....
 SlowedFever: it's not that hard to let players finish their code after time runs out
 SlowedFever: that would make them better
 Astrobytes: DO PUZZLES THEN
 SlowedFever: i am
 BlaiseEbuth: I want it to be a pronographic site&#160;!
 BlaiseEbuth: Now
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm waiting
 jacek: mods are asleep, postponies
 MSmits: that's a 5% issue BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: Post prawns
 BlaiseEbuth: -_-
 SlowedFever: I'm just saying that they could improve the way clash works
 BlaiseEbuth: Improve in your view
 MSmits: SlowedFever improve how
 dwarfie: clashs worked .... 5 years ago ....
 BlaiseEbuth: But since clashs are made for fun/competition and not to learn they will not
 SlowedFever: I don't see the downside of letting players fix their mistakes after the round has ending
 KiwiTae: SlowedFever just do very easy puzzle categories instead
 MSmits: SlowedFever yeah that would not be a bad idea
 Astrobytes: Never clash [solved]
 SlowedFever: thank you
 MSmits: but personally I feel that if you want to learn, do real puzzles
 MSmits: as has been said
 SlowedFever: yeah and now i know that
 jacek: clashes or one time things. you can 'return' to it using unofficial search like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>\
 jacek: and i cant type properly
 KiwiTae: SlowedFever like this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/veryeasy/nintendo-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/training/veryeasy/nintendo-sponsored-contest</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: CG like good ideas, you should propose it to them 
 Astrobytes: sigh
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 struct: This game is driving me crazy
 Astrobytes: Take a rest from it for a few days man
 struct: I cant
 MSmits: he cant
 Astrobytes: I noticed&#160;:)
 struct: I still think my eval can improve by so much
 struct: But im so bad with it
 jacek: been there done that
 Zajats: e10
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.espares.co.uk/advice/careandmaintenance/how-to-fix-an-e10-error-on-a-hoover-washing-machine#:~:text=Seeing%20E10%20or%20ten%20repeated,is%20in%20the%20correct%20position">https://www.espares.co.uk/advice/careandmaintenance/how-to-fix-an-e10-error-on-a-hoover-washing-machine#:~:text=Seeing%20E10%20or%20ten%20repeated,is%20in%20the%20correct%20position</a>.
 BlaiseEbuth: Was about to say that's out of board...
 MSmits: you cant be expected to understand every error, thankfully I am here
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: mmh my D&amp;B bot is now 3.7k lines
 MSmits: waiting for the limit to hit :P
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: I put in an mcts
 MSmits:  for early game
 MSmits: I was hoping it would beat mikla, but I think he's immune
 struct: im also struggling to improve on bt now
 MSmits: you'be been struggling all week
 MSmits: like me
 struct: tomorrow ill try one more thing or two then im done
 struct: i improved it two days ago
 MSmits: not sure i believe you :P
 MSmits: I remember STC
 struct: I havent spent much time on this game though
 struct: I started it like 1 week ago
 MSmits: only a week?
 MSmits: ah I guess this seemed like a long week
 struct: i would say 1 week and half maybe
 struct: i tried to do the early win check with shifts only but its not easy
 struct: I can do it easily if its the current player turn
 MSmits: so you need flips then
 struct: but if a player makes a move and opponent still has a move its harder to check for a win
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: currently I can find a win from 6th row for any player
 struct: if its his current turn
 struct: its quite simple
 MSmits: ah I see
 Drichie: Is it ok to ask questions here?
 MSmits: it is ok
 Drichie: Currently I am doing the Horse-Racing Duals practice puzzle. I have 2/3 of the testcases working. The last one has inputs 99,999 which makes my program time out. I'm guessing it is because I am doing too many comparisons and it is slowing it down too much yea?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: you need to make your algorithm smarter
 MSmits: so that it has to do less comparisons
 Astrobytes: even a pre-solve mcts didn't work eh
 MSmits: preferring loops and short objects didnt
 MSmits: i reversed it to prefer long chains now
 MSmits: maybe that helps, i dunno
 Astrobytes: that was the idea earlier
 MSmits: thats what my current submit does
 Astrobytes: looks OK but not your best
 MSmits: the thing is, from checking all the lost games it's clear to me that he doesnt solve better than i do, 
 MSmits: not anymore
 MSmits: the gamestate just favors him somehow, more often
 MSmits: when it's time to sovle
 MSmits: so he must do something in ply 1-35 that gives him some gain
 Marchete: just spam submit and you are 1st
 MSmits: no, i dont think so
 MSmits: this is a lucky submit again i think
 Astrobytes: Well yeah, definitely something going on there.
 MSmits: but sure i'll spam a bit to be sure
 Astrobytes: But what, I have no idea
 MSmits: I think the submit is pretty good. Hamburger got me twice, but other than that its fine
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw that, was on score?
 MSmits: 1 on score
 Astrobytes: Didn't look at the replats
 MSmits: 1 on nim
 MSmits: he does a nim search
 Astrobytes: *replays
 Astrobytes: Aha
 MSmits: even if i solve it sooner, if i solve it as a loss and he makes no mistakes...
 MSmits: he still wins
 Astrobytes: Captain Obvious enters the building :P
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: btw, i just noticed his nim solver is really good
 MSmits: he solves only 1 turn later
 MSmits: so he's not that far from me and mikla
 Astrobytes: Far enough it would seem
 MSmits: but as we discussed, you need to know how to prefer splitting moves and such
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 MSmits: there we go again, another submit. Last one was 5-4. Keeping score now to see what my real WR is
 Astrobytes: That's gonna be a bunch of games :P
 MSmits: well only if it's close
 MSmits: if i get to 10-30 i dont think I need more
 Astrobytes: Fair
 MSmits: I still have a solver search for pre-endgame on my list. Not sure how that'll be squeezed in my already 3.7k bot
 MSmits: might have to use minifier
 Astrobytes: Golf it
 MSmits: mmh I guess i could rename some of those awfully long functions
 MSmits: Link* ShortestGroundedLongStringWithNoShortAndNoDouble()
 struct: You get no points from winning vs the other players
 struct: it will be hard to pass miklla
 Astrobytes: jesus effin christ
 MSmits: its a very descriptive name :P
 Astrobytes: You know you can just put comments and strip them for the submit right
 MSmits: sure, I suppose
 MSmits: struct if i have &gt; 50% it's not hard. Just takes a lot of submit. But I probably do not have &gt;50, thats the real problem
 MSmits: I should just set up a cg bench with a long time between
 MSmits: is more efficient
 struct: i think the new version takes the current constraints into account
 MSmits: oh didnt know there's a new version
 struct: I think there is
 struct: it was updated around when this change was made
 Astrobytes: Still a lot slower though so...
 MSmits: dont need more than 100 games
 struct: maybe ill also use it for bt
 struct: anyways im off for today, need some rest from this game
 struct: gn
 MSmits: good idea struct, gn
 Astrobytes: gn struct, take it easy man
 theycallmedavid: Today I learned that it is possible to place flags in minesweeper
 MSmits: :cheer:
 MSmits: :cheers:
 MSmits: blah
 Astrobytes: :beers:
 Astrobytes: :raised_hands:
 MSmits: I set it to use 60s between games
 MSmits: hope that is ok
 Astrobytes: I thiiiink that's about right, but I don't know what the limit is per hour
 MSmits: if you happen to come across a mikla one of these days, ask him if he does anything special early game
 Astrobytes: I will do. Didn't see him for a bit
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: I noticed that he's somewhat immune to my making loops and such
 MSmits: so maybe he's also doing a mcts to make long chains
 Astrobytes: Yes, it seems he's already thought of it one way or another
 MSmits: yea
 dzosz: any1 knows is CG already has a puzzle that is about finding the smallest integer that is NOT in the list?
 Astrobytes: sounds clashy
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I'm off man, gonna watch a movie or something. Good luck and take care
 Marchete: Smits maybe he is OK to answer all that
 MSmits: yeah might be
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 MSmits: WR seems around 40%
 MSmits: 48 games in CG bench so far. 39% won
 MSmits: submit: 16-19 so far
 MSmits: mmh though on cg bench i had 2 crashes
 MSmits: allright thats clear enough I think. 47-70 score
 Marchete: who is who?
 Marchete: 47 you?
 MSmits: yes
 Marchete: too bad
 MSmits: yeah, but it's really close
 MSmits: this nim game is a bit all or nothing
 MSmits: I'm right between all or nothing
 MSmits: in that very arrow space
 MSmits: narrow
 Marchete: can't you make some kind of endgame book?
 Marchete: taking chain properties and such
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: chains dont matter
 MSmits: not in the nim game
 MSmits: anything long is immediately removed from consideration
 MSmits: all that matters is divide and conquer
 MSmits: only safe moves and sacrifice moves (1 box and 2 box moves)
 MSmits: you use a hashmap to store regions and their values
 MSmits: best way to look at it is just pick a replay like this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/571897632">https://www.codingame.com/replay/571897632</a>  and check when the solve happens, frame 35
 MSmits: it looks like nothing you can easily use tables for
 A0-poppy: 求带

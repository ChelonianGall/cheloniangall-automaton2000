 KiwiTae: o/
 KiwiTae: MadKnight hows your android
 jacek: is AutomatonNN android?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Uljahn: do AutomatonNNs dream of electric eulers?
 AutomatonNN: yeah i get it
 MarTiaNe: Is there any way I can check old coc games&#160;? Some kind of history or whatever
 Uljahn: like "show read" at the bottom of notifications?
 jacek: but it wont show the clashes problems themselves
 MarTiaNe: Oh I did not know about that, also it show only games in this week, but still at least something. thx 
 MSmits: hey jacek, I was wondering if i could ask you some questions about ML in oware/
 MSmits: or boardgames in general maybe
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hi MSmits, do you use mcts in breakthrough?
 MSmits: yeah, a form of it, but i kinda failed with eval in breakthrough
 MSmits: i eval all children on expansion and backpropagate scores. No random rollout
 MSmits: but then the eval needs to be good and it isn't
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I try random rollouts but they do not  seem to work either
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 MSmits: they don't
 MSmits: there are many games where they don't
 UnnamedCodinGamer: so good evaluation seems to be key
 MSmits: you can use random rollouts very well in bandas, uttt, connect 4 and some others
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw sometimes random rollouts also require some heuristics in the rollout
 MSmits: a good rollout policy
 MSmits: like in yavalath: Don't play instant loss moves
 MSmits: take wins when they appear 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, I try to do that - detect and use instant win or loss
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 MSmits: might not be enough for some games
 MSmits: the problem is that random moves just dont sample the space of reasonable moves very well
 MSmits: and if you dont play reasonable moves, the result is useless
 UnnamedCodinGamer: exactly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: no matter how many times you sample
 MSmits: well eventually you build the tree deep enough ofc
 MSmits: you will just solve the game :0
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, near the end when you would most probably detect a loss&#160;:)
 MSmits: I've been trying to get a handle on machine learning
 MSmits: in what little free time i have these weeks
 UnnamedCodinGamer: makes sense
 MSmits: I can do little things, but board games are definitely a step up
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this seems to be the way
 MSmits: not in every game I think and ML alone might not be enough in games where it does work
 MSmits: like you might still need endgame db and opening books and such
 MSmits: at least on CG
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I looked briefly into alpha zero, it seemed complicated to me
 MSmits: yeah i dont want to do azero
 MSmits: I'll just try a MLP
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what is mlp?
 MSmits: but I need to figure out how to do the actual training part
 MSmits: thats a basic NN, just a bunch of hidden layers, input, output.
 MSmits: no resnet, convolution etc.
 MSmits: i think oware is good to do this with
 UnnamedCodinGamer: mh
 UnnamedCodinGamer: did you solve the two nn puzzles?
 MSmits: nope
 UnnamedCodinGamer: they give you a good intuition
 MSmits: what does it teach you
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and you implement nn from scratch
 MSmits: because i do know the basics
 UnnamedCodinGamer: implementing your own nn
 MSmits: i just need to know how to train it in the domain of boardgames with self play
 MSmits: do the puzzles teach you that?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: well
 UnnamedCodinGamer: there is the training part
 MSmits: i know training and backpropagation on a data set
 MSmits: thats not what i need to learn
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and you must output the expected output after the training
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ok
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 MSmits: i need to know how to generate the data and use it, in a boardgame
 MSmits: thats what i wanted to ask jacek about
 MSmits: I mean i can let it play games against itself
 MSmits: that would give me board positions
 MSmits: and there is an endgame result
 MSmits: but not sure how to combine them and how search ties into this. With search you get deeper and find more positions for moves you dont even play
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I would like to also figure this out
 MSmits: my guess is that search with more depth just makes the endgame result more realistic/accurate, but otherwise does not add value
 MSmits: and that you actually train on the real positions that occurred in the game
 MSmits: you put those through the network and backpropagate with the end game resukt
 MSmits: result
 MSmits: but I am just guessing, so would help if someone confirmed&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the nn from the puzzles takes and outputs binary data, which can be board game states
 UnnamedCodinGamer: so on a basic level I see how the training should work
 MSmits: yeah i know, i did some tutorials with simple truth table
 MSmits: like the XOR operations
 MSmits: or you can train it to all states of TTT
 MSmits: that's a solved game so no need to do any self play
 MSmits: if you just have the data, there's a lot of good information to google and learn from 
 MSmits: but generating through selfplay and train on it, that's a bit harder. There's a bunch of stuff about azero you can download and try, but thats so far beyond what I want that it's not helpful
 MSmits: also, i want to avoid using tensorflow/keras/pytorch for now otherwise i end up with models i dont know how to put through CG
 UnnamedCodinGamer: so basically the input is a game state  and the output in the training data is the best move given the input
 MSmits: you can do it two basic ways i think
 MSmits: the output can be moves
 MSmits: or it can be board value
 MSmits: (or both actually)
 Doju: gosh, learning c++ is horrible after getting so used to python and javascript
 MSmits: so in oware you can say there's 6 outputs, one for each of the moves
 MSmits: or you can do between -1 and 1 for loss/draw/win
 MSmits: and then just pick the move  with the best value
 MSmits: Doju yes it is
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and you generate the training data offline using for instance mcts?
 MSmits: yeah, some search
 MSmits: otherwise the endgame results are going to be crap, if it's just depth 0
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: If I try it it I would probably stay away from python and ready to use packages
 MSmits: that's probably best yeah
 MSmits: btw, i tried a bunch of those
 MSmits: the amount of crap you have to install and the version problems are horrible
 MSmits: nothing works with the newest versions of packages
 MSmits: say you want to use the newest tensorflow... you cant use the newest python
 MSmits: if you use the newest tensorflow, you cant run many of the things people shared, with an older version
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, I have had similar problems with python packages for more trivial stuff
 UnnamedCodinGamer: have you managed to make something work and perform better than normal search?
 MSmits: nah, i have not done anything i need to search for
 MSmits: i was going to do this with oware, it is such a simple game
 MSmits: and i know it very well
 MSmits: it's like starting with TTT almost, except it's not solved
 Doju: Btw MSmits you've been online here every time that I've logged in in the past 10 months
 MSmits: lol
 Doju: I'm not entirely convinced that you're not a bot :D
 KiwiTae: Doju why u only lvl8?
 MSmits: well i've been a lot less active lately. This time it's really a coincidence&#160;:)
 Doju: KiwiTae i'm only really interested in the competitions
 KiwiTae: nice&#160;:)
 Doju: Now i'm here to check out my python code for the fall challenge
 Doju: trying to translate it to c++
 MSmits: ouch
 Doju: this is a rather slow process :d
 MSmits: yes
 Doju: given that my only experience with c++ is an introductory course on another website
 Doju: which took like 3 hours to complete
 MSmits: also, c++ has a lot of tricks that can make you use less code, but beginners wont know those
 KiwiTae: hehe
 MSmits: (i dont know those)
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: hey jacek
 KiwiTae: i realised there are many tricks to stl when i tried to use c instead of cpp
 MSmits: so jacek, i was meaning to ask you some questions about ML in oware specifically, but not sure how much you are sharing about this
 jacek: its alright
 MSmits: ok, so do you use selfplay or supervised in oware?
 Doju: I just wish there was an option to select the interpreter for python here
 jacek: selfplay
 MSmits: when you train, do you play real games, or games with more depth or less depth?
 jacek: or maybe 'self-supervised' would be more accurate
 MSmits: when you generate data i mean
 jacek: yes, real games with fast mcts
 MSmits: what do you mean fast? Lower calculation time?
 jacek: then i have position -&gt; value of the mcts' root
 MSmits: dont you use the endgame result as value to train on?
 jacek: lower time, or even just fixed iterations count
 jacek: i used that in the past, but using value from shallow search is faster and gave better results
 jacek: even if at first generations it comes from random network
 jacek: at the very least, near endgames have accurate values
 MSmits: well it makes sense that the endgame reslt is a poor value to use for early game states
 MSmits: because it is too far away
 MSmits: and in later states, the mcts root value should coincide with the endgame result anyway
 MSmits: ok, so you don't have 6 outputs, one for each of the moves, like some other implementations
 jacek: my training pipeline is similar to a0's now, just i train only value, and my target value is mcts result, not game final outcom
 jacek: yeah, only value
 MSmits: ok, so do you use convolution layers?
 jacek: still simple MLP
 MSmits: seems less useful in oware because it is not a 2D game
 MSmits: in what way is it close to azero then?
 MSmits: azero uses convolution and resnet
 jacek: i mean the training pipeline
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: generating data in batches, training, validation etc.
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: well you do exactly what i would prefer to try, it seems like a good baseline to experiment with
 jacek: it is evaltype-agnostic
 jacek: could be nn, n-tuple or handcrafter features
 MSmits: yeah it's a nn, it could be whatever&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh 
 MSmits: you mean the pipeline
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: well anything that has adjustable parameters
 MSmits: you could use it to train handcrafted features
 MSmits: parameters
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: thats something i need also
 MSmits: so could learn 2 things at once here
 MSmits: if i stick with  it
 kovi: bookmark
 MSmits: do you use anything  like tensorflow?
 MSmits: or is it fully homemade
 jacek: no, i made things in c++ from scratch
 MSmits: thats great, also what i want to try
 MSmits: that way you can more easily get it into CG
 kovi: not sure if c++ tensor fits into cg
 kovi: yeah
 MSmits: he can just make a long string and then convert it into tensors
 MSmits: thats not the hard part
 kovi: yeah but runtime lib
 MSmits: the hard part is writing efficient matrix calculations
 jacek: it all started when i finally rewrote the xor example from python's to c++
 kovi: it was not written with 100k limit consideration
 MSmits: right, thats good
 jacek: i think i have somewhere the python example without using np
 MSmits: when you say "the python example" which one do you mean?
 Doju: Hmm, I must be doing something wrong because I want to make pretty much everything protected instead of private
 kovi: there are a0 examples
 MSmits: yeah, but we are doing this far below a0 level&#160;:)
 MSmits: i dont want to touch that anymore
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/429ca1e6-890a-4b94-9773-49404526b36a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/429ca1e6-890a-4b94-9773-49404526b36a</a>
 MSmits: a0 is so complicated
 kovi: true, jacek value based thing is pretty wise
 jacek: XOR mlp, 1 hidden layer
 jacek: no fancy numpy
 Doju: Oh jeez
 Doju: are you doing neural nets without numpy?
 MSmits: thats great jacek, finally something without numpy
 jacek: just for learning for myself
 Doju: thats nuts :o
 jacek: no numpy in c++ standard libs
 MSmits: numpy makes things faster, but it doesnt make it more clear to learn
 Doju: great if you want to learn
 Doju: yeah thats true
 Doju: if the objective is to learn instead of making a fast thing then that makes sense
 kovi: but without numpy usually 1/10 speed
 MSmits: jacek for the matrix calcs, did you use any c++ library, or did you just figure out what intrinsics and other tricks to use, yourself?
 kovi: and without tf/gpu 1/100
 kovi: or worse
 MSmits: kovi if i take weeks to code something and the training takes 24 hrs instead of 1 hr, it's fine&#160;:)
 jacek: i use good old for loops, not even intrinsics 
 kovi: oh, you do c++ calc, sorry
 kovi: than its ok
 MSmits: I see, doesn't it bother you that it might be much faster jacek, with some tricks?
 MSmits: i mean obviously you dont need more speed atm
 jacek: yeah, NN eval is most consuming part of my code
 jacek: and i tried several times. im just too dumb
 MSmits: well if I ever get to the point where I can write this stuff and it's better than what you have, I will share it with you
 MSmits: might be a couple months. I want to get something before the end of my summer vacation. Trying to be generous with my time estimate here, apparently it's hard to learn
 jacek: and i finally got this work for Y. its 5th without opening book
 MSmits: nice one, Robo did as well
 MSmits: but yavalath has huge problems with determinism because of the early game endings
 jacek: its N-tuple with small hidden layer, MLP-tuple :v
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: I am going to be solving connect4 i think
 Doju: welp now i've got circular dependencies
 jacek: determinism... in training i choose final moves according softmax
 jacek: it was another thing that i lacked before
 jacek: allows for exploration but not too dumb exploration
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: hey, you train on cpu right?
 jacek: yeah
 MSmits: i read about gpu being 20-100 times faster
 MSmits: but i feel that's probably also because when people do that they have 4 really expensive ones running at once
 MSmits: doubt i'd achieve that factor with mine
 DomiKo: not really
 jacek: i have rather small nn
 WOLFRAHH: hii guys what was going
 jacek: not quite parallelizable
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: well maybe for training batch itself, the gpu would come in handy
 MSmits: seems so difficult to write that yourself
 MSmits: i would prefer to do it with tensorflow then and just convert their models somehow
 jacek: thats why i havent written convnets yet. i could write gazillion layers etc. in python but at first i want to make something small myself
 MSmits: and resnets?
 jacek: too
 WOLFRAHH: can any body tell what was going
 MSmits: convnets supposedly help for games like othello/yavalath, where the surroundings of a hex/square are important
 MSmits: doubt it would help much for oware
 jacek: my NNs so far have at most 2 hidden layers, so resnets are pointless.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: 2 is not much at all
 jacek: also i mostly exploit the fact that there is little change between game states, i.e. only few squares are affected
 MSmits: did you experiment with trading layer size for depth?
 MSmits: how do you exploit this?
 jacek: yeah, and this is what i came up for my framework and cg constraints
 jacek: for input/first hidden layer you need to only update the values instead of summing everything all over again
 jacek: partial updates, the main idea behind nnue
 MSmits: oh you mean it's a performance improvement
 MSmits: do you mean during training or running a game?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: well both
 MSmits: well that seems useful and alleviates the problem with you just using for loops
 jacek: though i do not use that in oware
 MSmits: it's easier to implement improvements like this when your code is not stuck in weird intrinsic and avx stuff
 proace21: hi
 MSmits: once you've gotten into that, you generally dont touch the code anymore. At least I dont
 jacek: have you read the updated <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php">http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php</a>
 jacek: the guy finally used patterns
 MSmits: wow really
 MSmits: i thought that was dead
 MSmits: it's cool he did that
 MSmits: anyways, thanks a lot jacek. I saved the chat and your xor example. When I have more free time I know what to do with it

 jacek: MSmits trained chess values <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/l71AZQn.png">https://i.imgur.com/l71AZQn.png</a> it took just few seconds and it converged to typical 'sane' values though knights seem to be undervalued here
 MSmits: is this chess960 or normal chess?
 MSmits: also I am guessing you kept the pawn fixed because you didn't need the extra free parameter&#160;:)
 MSmits: the other pieces are defined in terms of pawn value
 MSmits: you might get a different value for the pieces if you split the game into early, mid and lategame
 Ghostyy: bruh, i'm a begginerin c++ and i know how to make small programs, but when i join this website i knew that i'm a fool

 BlaiseEbuth: No 'cause nobody here does clashes...
 UltraCookie: I do they are fun
 BlaiseEbuth: Perhaps. But are you here&#160;?
 MSmits: are you getting all existential on us BlaiseEbuth?
 BlaiseEbuth: I think so I am.
 BlaiseEbuth: Are you&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: I will ask the NN jacek shared with me earlier
 MSmits: it says 0 1 1 0
 MSmits: so that's that
 BlaiseEbuth: So perhaps you exist, perhaps not... Schrodingsmith
 MSmits: indeed
 AntiSquid: what kind of NN&#160;?
 MSmits: heh, this is the xor example
 AntiSquid: ah the basic xor stuff @_@
 MSmits: i am pleased that I understand it even though all the variables are 1 character
 AntiSquid: internet is flooded with those
 MSmits: W, H, b etc.
 MSmits: yes, but this one has no numpy
 MSmits: so i can translate it to c++ without hurting my brain
 MSmits: then I can try to add more layers
 MSmits: oh and another reason why the example is good: It contains bias
 MSmits: many xor examples do not
 AntiSquid: you have a link or something&#160;?
 MSmits: he pasted it here, sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c6c8d8cb-a90e-4f2f-9557-7128dc2181b8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c6c8d8cb-a90e-4f2f-9557-7128dc2181b8</a>

 AntiSquid: cool thanks just wanted to see this one 
 inoryy: I'm starting to seriously think I have a sixth sense for when NNs are discussed here
 MSmits: hey inoryy&#160;:)
 inoryy: hello!
 AntiSquid: you missed an awful lot of discussions related to that then
 MSmits: I am just getting started trying things
 AntiSquid: sharpen your senses
 MSmits: after reading way too much about it
 inoryy: AntiSquid damn&#160;:( 
 MSmits: I'm doing what jacek is doing, a MLP for oware
 AntiSquid: hey inoryy where do you look for news updates on anything ML related in general&#160;?
 MSmits: well... after a long time messing :P
 inoryy: MSmits nice!
 MSmits: so my first job is translating this xor example to c++
 inoryy: AntiSquid colleagues, twitter, sometimes r/ML
 inoryy: holy moly I dropped from ~50th to 208, are there lots of newcomers at the top?
 MSmits: probably
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: they also recalculated like  a year ago, not sure when you last looked
 jacek: other example dont have biases? really?

 AntiSquid: probably the bigger contests brought in a lot stronger folks? no idea
 MSmits: thanks DaNinja
 AntiSquid: last one had 7k participants
 inoryy: wow
 MSmits: DaNinja lol... do i need to solve onboarding in C++ to see it?
 wlesavo: also a lot of points for recent contest make it easier to climb
 DaNinja: yes, trya mcts for it :D
 MSmits: lol
 inoryy: I remember that one, I think that's the first NN on CG&#160;:) 
 darkhorse64: small multis give more cp
 MSmits: it came after the csb tests?
 MSmits: or before?
 inoryy: noo, way before
 MSmits: hmm ok
 AntiSquid: no backprop
 AntiSquid: here's the big NN thread of stuff shared on CG <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/neural-network-ressources/1667">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/neural-network-ressources/1667</a>
 inoryy: I remember it because whenever I would argue NNs on CG are near impossible people would point me to that solution and I would laugh and be even more convinced because it's so absurd :D
 jacek: NN are possible on CG
 MSmits: well.. from what i know now, i dont see why anyone would ever think it was impossible
 MSmits: any small nn should be better than most evaluation functions
 inoryy: eh, hindsight 20/20
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 inoryy: not ashamed to admit I was way off, was a good lesson for me
 MSmits: i dont get why the onboarding has no backpropagation though
 jacek: trained offline
 KiwiTae: its already trained
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: missing a lot more than that :P
 darkhorse64: you can look at the binary neural network exercises too
 MSmits: would be even cooler if he trained it in the time available
 MSmits: and then used it

 darkhorse64: it includes training data
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: weird that he uses numpy and still has 200+ lines
 MSmits: mmh i think he doesnt even really use it, he seems to use normal python lists
 MSmits: oh nvm, he uses np.dot

 jacek: stop puting gibberish to your board then [solved]
 orangesnowfox: That isn't giberish, it's very important and belongs there [closed as not a bug]
 AntiSquid: i set them to 0s for sure, but then somehow get those magical numbers
 jacek: indexing issues?
 AntiSquid: think it was memset()
 AntiSquid: now i got a different wonderful bug! it's like metamorphosis 
 AntiSquid: Exception has occurred.Segmentation fault
 orangesnowfox: Nice UB you got there
 AntiSquid: UB&#160;?
 jacek: undefined behavior
 orangesnowfox: Segfaults almost *certainly* mean some kind of undefined behavior happened
 KiwiTae: using vectors?
 AntiSquid: you think i messed up something with index&#160;? i checked that bit over and over, might still be wrong though lol
 KiwiTae: might be u didnt reserve the memory
 orangesnowfox: might be a signed integer overflow, those are UB
 jacek: show all your code
 AntiSquid: could be i didn't translate the java function properly for spawning tile
 orangesnowfox: In the Java code it never has to worry about the&#160;% 0 error, because moves have to make *something* happen, which means there has to be an empty tile after the move
 jacek: blame euler
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, blame euler lol :p

 KiwiTae: u missing a return 0;
 AntiSquid: is there a limit of commands / turn&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: There might be a line length limit, but I haven't found it yet
 jacek: i think i tried over 1000 moves and it failed
 AntiSquid: ok will inspect seed later, got to shop something @_@
 jacek: at 22? :thinking:
 KiwiTae: online shopping maybe
 orangesnowfox: Would someone be willing to help me figure out why my tron doesn't like filling spaces very much? eg <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/536705366">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/536705366</a>
 KiwiTae: look like u have border issues
 orangesnowfox: yea, but y tho lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Are you always considering the opponent in your evaluation when "caged"&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, never got around to checking if my bot was isolated
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the point.
 BlaiseEbuth: Had the same problem long time ago.
 KiwiTae: im still stuck in gold there 
 KiwiTae: i think
 orangesnowfox: near the top of silver :v
 KiwiTae: u gonna crush me soon
 orangesnowfox: BlaiseEbuth: Is the point that you *do* check, or that you *shouldn't*?
 orangesnowfox: KiwiTae: I wouldn't be so sure about that, my first submit was 4 years ago, and I only have 28, I might just vanish again
 BlaiseEbuth: You should check. ^^
 BlaiseEbuth: 28 what&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: submits 
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh
 BlaiseEbuth: Same. But with a 0 between the 2 and the 8.
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://istheshipstillstuck.com">https://istheshipstillstuck.com</a>
 orangesnowfox: Okay, I just realized that didn't make it any less ambiguous for me sorry
 orangesnowfox: &gt;  You should check. ^^ Like, check if I'm isolated, or check what the opponent is doing
 BlaiseEbuth: Check if you are isolated to avoid your cycle to taking the opponent position into account when that does not matter.
 BlaiseEbuth: "It has cost us $43 billion, so far..." who is "us"&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: The world economy
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes. So why "us"&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Dunno
 AntiSquid: 21:29 here jacek, shop open until late

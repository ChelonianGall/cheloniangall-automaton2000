 Notter: Where do you report bugs?
 dmkalchev18: Azis
 IIDimov18: Azis
 Uljahn: Notter: on the forum/discord bug-report channel
 dmkalchev18: :cow:
 Notter: Ok thanks
 Westicles: How is that a bug?
 Notter: I don't know what the correct term is...
 Westicles: gamification
 Notter: Oh yeah... "gaming the system"
 Westicles: actually, grinding is probably a better term
 V_Brawl: is there a way to access the IDE in this game without participating in a game?
 V_Brawl: in this site***
 jacek: you can without submiting
 Uljahn: you can run some referees locally i guess
 V_Brawl: well i mean, i don't have C++ compiler on this computer so i'd like to use the website's compiler
 V_Brawl: and test some code with out entering a game
 Uljahn: for IDE you can use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet">https://tech.io/snippet</a>
 V_Brawl: thanks Uljahn that helps a lot
 Uljahn: how do you test a game without inputs?
 V_Brawl: i have a function where i predefine inputs and then i just call this functions
 Uljahn: ok, sounds good
 V_Brawl: or like i just assign a string as the input XDD
 davilla: how do we check to make sure Clash of Code hasn't been done already? I mean those aren't searchable, are they?
 Uljahn: check what? i don't get it sry
 davilla: if we're contributing a new idea, they want it to be original
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 AntiSquid: there's an (except clash) somewhere in the documentation
 AntiSquid: it doesn't matter much for clash if they repeat apparently
 davilla: oh OK, I just noticed this one had been rejected<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6377733771e847f2778ef50019ddd76a542a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6377733771e847f2778ef50019ddd76a542a</a>

 Uljahn: the requirement of being original is for puzzles not for clashes, just don't copy&amp;paste existing ones
 davilla: I see
 Westicles: All right, there's another 999
 Uljahn: davilla: also approvement process for clashes is rather chaotic and sometimes lacks quality because of achievements grinding, so don't be upset too much
 AntiSquid: safest bet is original puzzle with some graphics imo davilla 
 jacek: or even 3d
 AntiSquid: sure, make 5D chess puzzle
 Westicles: too similar to 5D chests
 davilla: lol
 davilla: what kind of graphics?
 ErrorRazor: Whatever you like
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/blockout">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/blockout</a>
 davilla: I actually did make a puzzle that can use some graphics. I don't know about animations tho, that might be overkill.
 davilla: Anyone know why I would be getting Failure, Found: last line with end of line, Expected: Nothing?
 davilla: the output looks exactly like it should
 Westicles: You probably have two carriage returns
 davilla: well it's ascii art, the output is supposed to be multiple lines
 Westicles: Check if you have one too many
 davilla: hmm I just fixed it, not sure how
 davilla: let me report back on this
 davilla: oh yeah, you were right, I went beyond the last line
 davilla: wow, that wasn't a very clear message tho
 davilla: thanks for your help
 davilla: next question
 davilla: "Mountain Map Convergence" says 9 days left to validate
 davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>
 davilla: I solved it. Is there any other way I'm supposed to validate?
 davilla: It doesn't look like I can approve, for instance.
 Westicles: You need to be level 20 to approve
 davilla: Ah OK that's why. Be there soon!
 Westicles: Be sure and save your solution, it disappears when the puzzle is approved
 davilla: Thanks. I actually posted it, since I'd seen similar behavior on other puzzles.
 KelvinAndHubbles: well, that was an abomination. Passed all tests in CoC, submit it, and get 14% score. Wasn't even hardcoded just an actual solution

 seifiali84: how can i invite my friend to clash of code?
 JLukeSkywalker: private or public?
 seifiali84: public
 JLukeSkywalker: there is a list of people you follow that are online you can click invite, or there is also a shareable link to the current clash on the right side of the screen afte you join

 seifiali84: you*
 JLukeSkywalker: np, gl
 Therabidpanther: i hate code golf. i have two more chars than this dude, and idk what to do lolol
 Therabidpanther: but i dont want to submit losing code
 JLukeSkywalker: backspace?
 JSboss: is it js?
 Therabidpanther: python
 JSboss: pity. good luck
 Therabidpanther: i need to use ruby, some people get really small with it lol

 JLukeSkywalker: I=input
 JLukeSkywalker: and // instead of int()
 JLukeSkywalker: that should give like 6 chars shorter i think
 Therabidpanther: thx
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, with python if there are at least 3 inputs, or 2+ inputs and a print you can always get shorter by renaming input

 Nickname_thats_not_taken: hi world
 JLukeSkywalker: 2k, ur gonna get chat banned
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: can someone explain this to me&#160;:
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: [char if char == '#' else '0' for char in row]
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: it is in python
 ZarthaxX: list comprehension
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: just the condition
 ZarthaxX: it's the same as doing a loop
 JLukeSkywalker: makes a list of either the character or '0'
 ZarthaxX: and assigning values based on codnition
 jacek: its python 'ternary'
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: well everyone said it already hehe
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yes but what is the condition
 JLukeSkywalker: cher=='#
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: if char === # then 0 else do nothing?
 ZarthaxX: if the char is hashtag then return char
 JLukeSkywalker: im assuming this is like a maze right?
 ZarthaxX: else '0'
 JLukeSkywalker: # are walls
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yes
 JLukeSkywalker: so its saying set everything that isnt a wall to 0
 JLukeSkywalker: the walls stay
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: ok
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i see
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: thx JLukeSkywalker
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: thx everyone
 JLukeSkywalker: pikapchu?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yes sir
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i given up
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i am reading someones code
 jacek: :scream:
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhh:sweat_smile:
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: sorry 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: you know, understanding is half the solving hhhh
 JLukeSkywalker: lol, mine does almost the same thing
 JLukeSkywalker: grid = [[0 if c.isdigit() else c for c in input()] for i in [0]*height]
 JLukeSkywalker: 0's or walls
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: nice
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i am converting python code to javascript :sweat_smile:
 JLukeSkywalker: ew
 JLukeSkywalker: i would give up too
 jacek: :skull:
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: naaaaa
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: sorry sir jacek
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: it was not that complicated to convert tho
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: here is the python code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Aikeko/Codingame-Practice/blob/master/Detective%20Pikaptcha%20EP2">https://github.com/Aikeko/Codingame-Practice/blob/master/Detective%20Pikaptcha%20EP2</a>
 JLukeSkywalker: lol wow
 JLukeSkywalker: mine is 30 lines ...
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: noooooo
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: is is shortest mode for you?
 JLukeSkywalker: just normal code
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: god damn
 jacek: everything can be shortest mode if youre brave enough
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: not brave enough
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: should never be
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: or hell would break loose
 KiwiTae: o/
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: btw i replace that code with this&#160;:

 Lissij: Is there a way to check why a validator (not an IDE test case) fails?
 ZarthaxX: hi kiwo&#160;:*
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX o/
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 Flekysek: Hi is here somebody who knows also C++ QT? 
 Flekysek: I would need some basic help.... 
 Flekysek: with my code
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX not bad working eeh
 jacek: just ask your question
 Flekysek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6833974-eefd-48fa-922c-55d304106ab6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6833974-eefd-48fa-922c-55d304106ab6</a>
 ZarthaxX: KiwiTae good good&#160;:)
 Flekysek: not sure if you will understand my point but I really hope so
 JLukeSkywalker: so if user puts in 4 for size, you get a 4x4 grid of buttons to press, and a 4x4 grid to display moves?
 Flekysek: exactly
 JLukeSkywalker: and the error is that you want them to then be able to change the board size after it is made
 Flekysek: exactly because if they change it after then there is outrange error
 JLukeSkywalker: can you run a function off the user pressing back?
 Flekysek: yes I can there is back Qpushbotton
 JLukeSkywalker: I think its probably going to be easiest to reset the entire window, and start your board back to nothing when they hit back
 Flekysek: Ok then I will do it this way. Or at least I will try. Ithought that there is some possibility to delete all of the buttons if they resize it. Because idea was that if player is going t go back and forward he can still continue but if he change anything in menu then the game starts from begining 
 Flekysek: if you understand me...&#160;:) 
 JLukeSkywalker: so you can resize the game in the middle of the game?
 JLukeSkywalker: you can pop_back the gameBoard, and the loop through and pop each row
 JLukeSkywalker: that would decrease size
 JLukeSkywalker: this just sounds like a bad concept in general though
 Flekysek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aae8c079-e1ac-456d-9fd2-56ec03cfa71b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aae8c079-e1ac-456d-9fd2-56ec03cfa71b</a>
 jacek: :tada:
 JLukeSkywalker: if you store the old size, only change if the size changed
 Flekysek: :blush: ok thank you! 
 JLukeSkywalker: gl
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: or just store some kind of grid history.. for each size they played at...
 GilbertGaming27: Gilbert
 JLukeSkywalker: its probably easier to just pop or push until it gets to the correct size
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yes
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: probably
 bionoir: Hello, does anybody has solved the "Nuggets numbers" problem&#160;? I've a solution (Python) but the last 3 test cases fail since my code is too slow. Suggestions&#160;? I've read about using gdc and memoization but I don't understand how to put all together.
 JLukeSkywalker: memoization is basically just storing your function calls
 JLukeSkywalker: so if you check 3,4,5, store the answer in a table so that you dont have to check it again
 JLukeSkywalker: python i usually do that in a dictionary with the key being the tuple of function args
 bionoir: ah, the calling arguments&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: say i have def doStuff(a, b)my first line would be if (a,b) in lookup: return lookup[(a,b)]
 Maexel: or you can use cache decorator from functools
 bionoir: ok, I see now the interest of using it since in the logs the calls with the combination of arguments fall in similar cases
 bionoir: thanks, not read about it... I'll check!
 JLukeSkywalker: Maexels answer is better if you know what decorators are
 bionoir: nope, but I'm here to learn&#160;:-)
 JLukeSkywalker: it pretty much does what I said on its own for you, and is a bit quicker
 JLukeSkywalker: i would try to solve it without the decorators, but definitely a topic worth looking up for the future
 Mil27Coder: javascript
 JLukeSkywalker: what about
 AntiSquid: must be a gilbert moment
 Ordonnateur: When you got access to the coding escape beta but you have no friend ç_ç give me a matchmaking (like for clash) or a "try it alone" button T_T
 orangesnowfox: :c
 orangesnowfox: Praise be the alphabeta
 orangesnowfox: (I wrote an onitama bot)
 orangesnowfox: ... The submitted code has a bug, but I want to get in wood 1 before submitting the fix (so that I don't have to wait again)
 jacek: alphabeta eh?
 jacek: what kind of bug
 orangesnowfox: misread a rule for the win condition
 orangesnowfox: Thought it was "any of your units on opponent shrine" but it's "your master on opponent shrine"
 BlaiseEbuth: fix your reading
 orangesnowfox: Did that
 BlaiseEbuth: :p
 orangesnowfox: well, can't fix my eyes though
 orangesnowfox: they've been getting worse over time
 jacek: they too rusty
 orangesnowfox: nah, to blurry (and yes, I get the rust joke)
 orangesnowfox: jacek, apparently I'm coming for your rank again'
 jacek: rank is the same, just different league
 orangesnowfox: Nope, I'm in wood 1 now, you're not out of my league :p
 jacek: oh
 jacek: still bugged?
 orangesnowfox: Nope, fixed now
 orangesnowfox: Although, there's another rule I'm not sure on... Can you only pass cards if *neither* of them is usable, or if *that card* isn't usable
 orangesnowfox: is/are
 jacek: you can pass only if you have no valid moves
 orangesnowfox: Ah, and then you can pass either?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: a player can PASS a card of his choice,
 jacek: ~
 jacek: though in real game it happens really rarely
 JLukeSkywalker: is the card game bullshit solveable, or would it be a possible multi on here?
 orangesnowfox: I'm pretty sure it's solvable
 JLukeSkywalker: thats what i thought
 orangesnowfox: There's a whole bunch of cases that are blacklisted
 orangesnowfox: Because they're a 6 depth win for p1
 orangesnowfox: I mean, all games without randomness are solvable 
 jacek: i think JLukeSkywalker meant <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_(game)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_(game)</a>

 JLukeSkywalker: yes, i did
 jacek: actually i dont remember if i have pass implemented :thinking:
 Unicorn123321: #Clash_bot
 orangesnowfox: jacek: so, what, you consider "no moves left" a loss?
 jacek: but you can move
 orangesnowfox: well, you can pass, but if you don't consider those...
 jacek: well i dont remember, probably i'd timeout. but maybe i did implemented
 orangesnowfox: ur #1, so you probably did impl
 AntiSquid: impl?
 orangesnowfox: implement 
 jacek: thats was so long time ago...
 Unicorn123321: #2_
 jacek: orangesnowfox actually no, i havent. if i have no moves i consider game over and draw. technically you can exploit it and in this situation i would timeout
 orangesnowfox: lol
 jacek: im still #1 so its very rare situation
 jacek: maybe youll motivate me to fix it
 orangesnowfox: I have to go deeper first
 jacek: do you have fancy eval?
 orangesnowfox: my only scoring is win + difference in uinits
 orangesnowfox: But my eval itself is fancy, yes

 orangesnowfox: guess I need to use c++ then
 jacek: rust should have some builtins no?
 jacek: also, are you using bitboards?
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, using bitboards (except for move enumeration)
 orangesnowfox: jacek: Rust doesn't let you use intrinsics inline (you have to call a function) unless you compile with it enabled
 orangesnowfox: and since Rust doesn't have `#pragma`...
 jacek: maybe ask dbdr, i bet he knows how to do stuff in rust
 orangesnowfox: Currently looking at gitc
 orangesnowfox: Not sure how to do the inc strat that is so meta
 Mohamed_Kharrat: anyobdy here solved "THE GRAND FESTIVAL - I"&#160;? its a medium puzzle
 orangesnowfox: If you have a question about it, don't wait for someone to tell you if they know anything about it, just ask the question
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 JLukeSkywalker: that should be like part of the onboarding

 Andoo: :grinning: What a great question asking tutorial, I'm definitely stealing that
 Andoo: sorry...borrowing
 therealbeef: I borrowed it from someone else here too&#160;;-) but i even use it at work sometimes
 therealbeef: especially the 'XY problem'
 AntiSquid: is there a version of 8ball that spits out questions instead of random answers?
 jacek: let's ask AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN:  RoboStac has a pathfinding list of contests with this line again
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: successful ping
 therealbeef: hmm reaching legend in CSB is kind of easy, isn't it? im not even using shields, boosts, checking where opponents are, or even checking where my other pod is. :P
 AntiSquid: depends what you're doing, i used a blocker like everyone else
 AntiSquid: not sure anymore what's best 2 runners or 1 runner 1 blocker
 therealbeef: i hope that will be needed in legend, would make it more interesting
 AntiSquid: you need a lot more than that in legend
 therealbeef: i see
 therealbeef: there are a 1000 players in legend; that's where the game really begins i suppose
 warsameabdalla: i have an interview tomorrow in c and the interview told me to solve some codingame puzzles then discuss it in the interview i have done 7 easy ones
 AntiSquid: replay you vs currently 1st in the league: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/537398758">https://www.codingame.com/replay/537398758</a>
 jacek: more like in top 20%
 warsameabdalla: do you guys think thats enough
 AntiSquid: do you think it's enough?
 AntiSquid: you cherry picked super easy ones&#160;?
 warsameabdalla: i dont know i ended up doing the easy puzzles and not the medium ones&#160;?
 MYBK: hello there, just wondering... did you use Genetic algorithm or any heuristic algorithm to  enter legend league in CSB or just trigonometry&#160;? 
 jacek: what position is that? did they tell you what puzzles to do?
 AntiSquid: probably they check problem solving skills, look for interesting puzzles you want to discuss in the interview, probably NOT easy ones
 warsameabdalla: no they just said do some puzzles i did chuck norris and a few others
 AntiSquid: chuck norrirs probably ok although it's easy ... who knows
 jacek: in c?
 warsameabdalla: yes in c
 jacek: could be interesting how you approached it
 warsameabdalla: im new to c by the way i studied js in the past and the company knows that
 AntiSquid: MYBK trigo more than enough
 MYBK: cool thank you, I will enhance my solution to enter legend league 
 AntiSquid: then it shouldn't be hard to convert code to c if you write in js first :P just saying
 warsameabdalla: js has all these functions fofr array methods but with c you have to write all the functions and strings are alot more complex in c
 warsameabdalla: or maybe its just because iim new so do you think theyll think im a joke for solving those 7 (easy level) puzzles for the interview
 warsameabdalla:&#160;?
 jacek: what position is it? junior, mid, senior?
 warsameabdalla: junior role
 warsameabdalla: i just graduated a bootcamp
 jacek: should be fine
 therealbeef: AntiSquid haha yeah i get smacked by him, but i also notice that you can go faster in legend, while im still on gold settings
 jacek: maybe do some medium puzzle, or theyll gonna ask why you did only easy ones
 warsameabdalla: nice one mate ill try some now
 AntiSquid: if you want to impress do some hard / very hard ones with visuals
 jacek: space maze :v
 AntiSquid: lol you could do Breach, it's on very hard but you need patience and good guesswork
 warsameabdalla: i was struggling with some of the easy ones lool how am i going to do very hard puzzles
 warsameabdalla: chuck norris took me hours 
 warsameabdalla: lmao
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-2">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-2</a> you can do this one btw it's on very hard, but it's NOT actually very hard, just need to split the search and then code for the corner case ...
 cytolytic: no one asked
 AntiSquid: or maybe solve <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bulls-and-cows-2">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bulls-and-cows-2</a>&#160;? you just need a basic algo
 warsameabdalla: ight cheers antisquid ill check em out
 jacek: or :notebook: :soccer:
 AntiSquid: Breach is not hard, that's the joke, that it's in the wrong category
 warsameabdalla: i just realised your ranked number 10 on this website so you are obvioyusly a genius
 AntiSquid: i am giving genius interview advice .
 Westicles: He's messing with you, don't try breach
 AntiSquid: hey what's the 5D chests cover art from&#160;?
 Westicles: Cover of Pirx the Pirate by Stanislaw Lem
 Westicles: Tales of Pirx the Pirate
 AntiSquid: good author @_@
 Westicles: Yeah he is.  He was one of the first authors where I tried to read all his books
 jacek: mhm
 jacek: the pirate? or pilot
 Westicles: oops, pilot
 Andoo: Station
 Shark6002: nice
 DrChrisser: I get the error message:let nodesFlat = nodeCoordinates.flat();
 HarrisonW: Hello

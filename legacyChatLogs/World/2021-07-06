 test00: Good afternoon,
 test00: is there any way to get input data by file&#160;?
 KiwiTae: ya
 test00: because I hope to run my code locally but difficult to copy input data from log screen
 SuryaTheOP: hloo
 KiwiTae: test00
 KiwiTae:     std::ifstream in(YOUR_FILE);
 KiwiTae: in cpp
 test00: oh,, even it's run online, can save data in my local file&#160;?
 test00: let me try&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: no lol but you can download game in/out stream with CG tools I forgot where to find those

 BlaiseEbuth: Pin it. Like an owl on a door.
 test00: ok just pin it
 derjack: spin it

 derjack: now i can read it clearly :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsdown:
 SuryaTheOP: i got a fastest clash which gives a range of numbers and we have to find how many number of divisiors  for each of number. i got it and while testing it it saying that process has timed out.  
 SuryaTheOP: is there any way to correct this
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, optimize your code, it is too slow.
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably a mathematical trick.
 SuryaTheOP: the clash is over
 SuryaTheOP: but i don't get it
 SuryaTheOP: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/64019a6ded4ae1f1c40a5103fe583425638d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/64019a6ded4ae1f1c40a5103fe583425638d</a>
 SuryaTheOP: anyone can explain this
 BlaiseEbuth: Explain what&#160;?
 SuryaTheOP: how the code work
 SuryaTheOP: it got solution in c++ but i am python learner
 BlaiseEbuth: The solution you mean&#160;?
 SuryaTheOP: yess
 SuryaTheOP: i dont know c++
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll take a look
 SuryaTheOP: thanks in advance
 derjack: helpful mod is helpful
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 SuryaTheOP: @BlaiseEbuth you can DM me
 derjack: puzzle of the week about :cheese: eh
 derjack: whenever i see oware something is happening
 tree.png: hey guys, how do you switch Test Cases in Clash of Code?
 Zedogx: use setting then custom\
 tree.png: no like when you're in a round, you do the first test case, right?
 tree.png: how do you switch to the next one to keep progressing?
 Zedogx: oh
 tree.png: i'm sometimes finished with the first test case.. idk how to move to the next one though
 DaNinja: ctrl+Enter
 tree.png: thank you!
 tree.png: hmm.. it didn't seem to work for me
 tree.png: i'm on mac if that has anything to do with it
 tree.png: Ctrl + Enter doesn't seem to do anything but Cmd + Enter did something, didn't switch to the next test case though
 DaNinja: ctrl+shift+enter
 tree.png: i'll try that.. thanks!
 DaNinja: not sure if its Option or Cmd on Mac
 BlaiseEbuth: Is that OK tree.png&#160;?
 c0nc4c: i solved there is no spoon kekw
 c0nc4c: pogger
 derjack: :tada:
 tree.png: BlaiseEbuth, i think i misunderstood what i was supposed to do because i thought that the test cases were seperate tabs instead of just being in one script
 BlaiseEbuth: That's wath I supposed. ^^Yeah you have to write one program able to solve any test.
 RitamChakraborty: Hopefully those who are from US had enjoyed the fireworks to the fullest on 4th July.
 BlaiseEbuth: :tada:
 derjack: yeah, happy treason day
 juice0: it's only treason if you fail
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Same for crimes against humanity.
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 derjack: like javascript
 BlaiseEbuth: It's javascript only if you fail? :thinking:
 Westicles: what's the shortest way in sh to read a line you don't want to use?
 juice0: no idea here
 dbdr: Westicles: read
 Westicles: that works in bash, but in sh it gives me an error without a variable (read n).  thought something else would be shorter
 dbdr: ah, you're still golfing
 Westicles: I'm pretty much done.  I don't have any good ruby/perl/bash ones to start with, so I just filled the holes where you didn't bother
 derjack: somethings new marchet?
 Marchete: nope
 Marchete: do you think royale is NN?
 Marchete: I think is book
 Marchete: but dunno
 Marchete: I mean, Smits isn't first because he doesn't want to
 Marchete: he can counterbook all NNs
 Marchete: in no time
 Marchete: it's just he doesn't want to
 derjack: _Royale? hmm. could be also leaderboard instability, only 2-3 people spam submiting lately
 princess_of_zeal: what are you working on?
 derjack: and smits couldnt counterbook my bot muchly. i have more some randomness in my search
 derjack: Automaton2000 who is princess_of_zeal
 Automaton2000: nah, i just like it
 Marchete: most NN except jace_k are too deterministic
 Marchete: like changing 0.01 some parameter it goes from all losses to all win/draws
 Marchete: my last NN weights don't lose a lot, but it draws a lot
 Marchete: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/Marchete">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/Marchete</a>
 derjack: oh my
 Marchete: drawing isn't good for scoring
 Marchete: esp. against top3+
 Marchete: I was giving some slight bonus to drawing, like 0.01, maybe that's not good
 Marchete: drawing=tie
 derjack: if a player already has 24 seeds, he could later treat the draw as lose
 Marchete: I think it should be more as player position
 Marchete: if p2 would be a proven loss
 Marchete: then make a bonus
 Marchete: but I don't know if there are proven win loss per position
 Marchete: I hate this game
 Marchete: 1 star
 RED_X000: Ayo Mr. White, I got the drip!
 Marchete: you see the 1 star rating? it's mine
 derjack: in oware?
 Marchete: yeah
 derjack: oO
 Marchete: 93% winrate, each enemy &gt;60% winrate, no even 2nd place
 Marchete: that's fine
 derjack: is this love-hate reliationship
 derjack: like rebless and uttt
 Marchete: more hate-hate-anger relationship
 dbdr: not enough matches maybe?
 Marchete: too many draws
 dbdr: that's a problem with commu multis
 derjack: and you pushed royale to 4th
 BlaiseEbuth: o/ dbdr
 Marchete: but it's disheartening a 93% winrate and being 3rd
 dbdr: \o
 BlaiseEbuth: How's your massage room?
 BlaiseEbuth: :p
 dbdr: Marchete, activate " Count draws as half-win "
 dbdr: BlaiseEbuth, it's gone (I hope!)
 dbdr: at least from the public eye&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: :fingers_crossed:
 derjack: welp he still has green bars against top players
 Marchete: ahh :D
 BlaiseEbuth: I prefer Irish pubs to green bars...
 TipuTare: guys
 TipuTare: can i add a number to a list 
 TipuTare: like 
 TipuTare: list = []
 TipuTare: list = list + a where a is a string or a number
 Uljahn: don't use keywords as names
 TipuTare: im just asking
 Uljahn: you can do lst += [a]
 TipuTare: oh ty man
 BlaiseEbuth: He's a cat
 Astrobytes: instead of asking all the time, it's often better to try it and see what happens
 progamego: i dit it al rong):
 Astrobytes: then look at the documentation
 BlaiseEbuth: :ear_no_evil:
 TipuTare: imma just ask for now&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: :hear_no_evil:
 derjack: who needs to read docs or statements
 Marchete: read documentation is for weak
 Marchete: weaks
 Marchete: first code, then get bugs and search on stackoverflow
 BlaiseEbuth: Asking too. 
 placez: if I don't run the tests but the code is  working then it'll show 0%?
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 dbdr: Marchete, you were awesome to write the cgzero article!
 Marchete: I hope it's useful to someone :D
 Marchete: at least jolindie_n was able to reproduce some good results
 BlaiseEbuth: jolindien?
 Marchete: 8th in leaderboard, it was 4th not long ago
 dbdr: definitely. the whole pipeline is big, it's great to have a working one to start playing with and understand progressively
 dbdr: my bot submitted right now is cgzero
 Marchete: with some improvements I was able to get 5th place in 1 hour of training
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: noice
 Marchete: it was hard to setup?
 derjack: how long did you train
 Marchete: wait
 Marchete: Rust?
 Marchete: Oo
 dbdr: it's my rust packer
 derjack: :unamused:
 Marchete: ah
 Marchete: you are fast
 dbdr: 2 hours of training maybe
 Marchete: nice
 Marchete: the bot is very sensitive to MCTS rollout count
 Marchete: the more rollouts the better
 Marchete: top 10 in 2hrs training, not bad
 dbdr: by the way, the model fitting is a small part, so I don't think GPU matters a lot, right?
 Marchete: I haven't used it
 dbdr: the rest is CPU, selfplay and pitplay
 Marchete: in fact I tested it and didn't notice any perf improvement
 Marchete: I used 6 threads for CGZero
 derjack: can GPU exploit the fact of one-hots in first layer?
 Marchete: the rest was for gaming while it trained :D
 dbdr: the model.fit should be faster, but it's less than 10% of the time, so does not really matter
 Marchete: so I prefer to keep GPU free
 RoboStac: gpu's about twice as fast on the training for me, but the training is a tiny part of the overall time
 dbdr: exaxctly
 RoboStac: if you do conv stuff it starts to matter a lot more
 Marchete: you can improve a lot the first layer
 Marchete: I did
 Marchete: and it's noticeable
 Marchete: also in Conv2D
 Marchete: I added Conv2D in Mokka
 dbdr: compared to your published version I suppose?
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a>
 Marchete: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: Mokka is a f*****g good cake... :yum:
 Marchete: but it's not that far from published
 Marchete: also a Coffee
 derjack: mokka? isnt this coffee?
 dbdr: so <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a> is optimized, just not included in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero</a>?
 Marchete: yeah, as I was inspired by a NN repo called "Latte"
 Marchete: you know, Mokka as a derived work
 Marchete: not exactly dbdr,
 Marchete: latest CGZero had one-hot improvements for Dense
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, but also a cake with coffee.
 Marchete: Mokka repo just added Conv2D
 dbdr: ok, nice
 Marchete: it's irrelevant for CGZero that part
 Marchete: except on future uses, like for Connect4 and such
 dbdr: yeah, not for oware
 Marchete: I think I added a performant Conv2D too
 dbdr: I got a gen winning only 28% to the previous one, that was unusual
 Marchete: also can be improved/cached much more
 dbdr: most improve, or at least 45%
 Marchete: not for me dbdr
 Marchete: I also saw those massive drops
 dbdr: that looks suspicious to me, no?
 Marchete: probably
 Marchete: that's why I don't always train with latest
 dbdr: will need to play with hyperparams to compare the results
 Marchete: and keep 2 bests
 dbdr: happy to have a working base now&#160;:)
 Marchete: cpuct
 Marchete: that's a mess for me
 dbdr: yeah, I did not optimize cpuct
 derjack: so many things to tweak
 Marchete: also dbdr read on tech.io the final words
 Marchete: here I put some info about uncommited changes I did
 dbdr: ok
 dbdr: I pushed you #2 I think&#160;:)
 derjack: :rage:
 Marchete: but overall you get to top 6th in little time
 dbdr: what's wrong derjack
 derjack: nothing~
 dbdr: I started yesterday
 Marchete: I think it learn fast, so it seems the pipeline is correct in most parts
 dbdr: had to fight with a tensorflow packaging bug in nixos
 derjack: welp, if 20 more ppl will start suing cgzero, you might not get into top6 that easily
 Marchete: obviously
 dbdr: and learning the pipeline, but the notebook was super useful
 derjack: using even
 Marchete: but I think it's OK to have some basic framework about how an AlphaZero work
 Marchete: I struggled a lot
 dbdr: sure, will need to improve it
 Marchete: so many sh*tty repos on github...
 derjack: yeah, NN is just small part of it
 TipuTare: what  is the fuction to eliminate an elemnt from the list?
 Marchete: if you improve something dbdr, I'd like to learn
 TipuTare: pop() right?
 derjack: yes
 dbdr: ok. one thing I was thinking of, the pitting against best2 could be skipped if win against best1 is low. but it's used to decide the proportion of selfplay
 dbdr: thoughts?
 Marchete: exactly for that reason
 derjack: pop() will remove last element, pop(index) element at index
 dbdr: I'm not sure it's worth it
 Marchete: to get proportions
 Marchete: probably not
 dbdr: anyways it's only when progress is becoming rare that it matters
 dbdr: maybe with better hyperparams there should be more constant progress
 derjack: in pitting, do you stop early if you know its not gonna reach 55%?
 Marchete: no I don't stop
 TipuTare: so like if alice is the list
 TipuTare: alice.pop(index)
 derjack: [2,3,5].pop(1) -&gt; [2,5]
 Marchete: I also lose a lot of time in the Samples processing
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth slaps TipuTare with a large python documentation.</b></p><p><img src="/a/61997162908277" /> Marchete: probably having the whole selfplay + sampler in one daemon process can be better
 dbdr: NNSampler? looked pretty instantaneous to me
 Marchete: at all
 Marchete: once it's "filled", ordering samples by count is expensive
 Marchete: 6th place, not bad
 dbdr: that was my gen 23
 Marchete: gen depends a bit on match count, EPOCHs etc
 dbdr: right
 Marchete: I reached it in about gen 11
 dbdr: then progress stopped?
 Marchete: top 3 in like 36 with a lot of restarts :D
 Marchete: and tweaks
 Marchete: it reaches some nash equilibrium
 dbdr: top N is not a stable metrics&#160;;)
 Marchete: hard to improve or improvements are overfitting
 Marchete: so in arena are worse
 dbdr: there is ann_1="gen0242"nn_2="gen0239"
 Marchete: also self winrates aren't a 100% sure metric
 dbdr: in the notebook :D
 derjack: add submitting to CG as pitting. [solved]
 Marchete: 242? lol that was from previous versions
 dbdr: might slow down things *a bit*
 Marchete: but yes, I've restarted a lot of times
 dbdr: Marchete, putting the pitting result in the file name is ... interesting :Dis it for debugging convenience? using ls
 Marchete: yeah, to open a folder and see winrat3es
 Marchete: at some point I can pick a gen with 50+ , even if it isn't 55+
 Marchete: to test in CG
 Marchete: but I did that since ever, on CGBenchmark and similar
 Marchete: also as an added tip/info
 Marchete: if you have traindata samples
 Marchete: you can create a different model and retrain with those samples
 Marchete: it's faster sometimes than start from scratch
 DevilJamJar: My CoC was printing the last character of a string 🥲
 dbdr: ah, because the samples only depend on the input and output shapes, not the inner layers, right?
 Marchete: yes
 dbdr: so if you had valid moves as input, you can't do that :D
 dbdr: *add
 Marchete: I think I can
 Marchete: well
 Marchete: if you only change hidden layers
 dbdr: yeah. nice tip
 Marchete: if you cahnge inputs then no
 Marchete: maybe valid moves as inputs is a nonsense, I don't know
 dbdr: my intuition is it should speed up training
 Marchete: I noticed that
 Marchete: but only useable on games with little  valid moves
 derjack: depending how you save game position. if its just game position (not inputs) and the policy/result then you can train anything on the samples
 AllYourTrees: openai 5 did this thing where they dot product valid moves vector with intent vector output from the network <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://neuro.cs.ut.ee/the-use-of-embeddings-in-openai-five/">https://neuro.cs.ut.ee/the-use-of-embeddings-in-openai-five/</a>
 AllYourTrees: but not sure that how would work for games with smaller action space
 dbdr: intent is policy?
 AllYourTrees: dot(intent, valid moves) is policy
 AllYourTrees: they called it "intent" but its just the last output from the network
 AllYourTrees: cause they had 170k possible actions, but the last layer was much smaller than that
 dbdr: I think that's always cone one way or another. no point playing an invalid move
 Marchete: yeah I thought about feeding valid moves input layer right before the policy part
 dbdr: *done
 Marchete: invalid moves have 0 policy
 Marchete: so in the end the NN tends to give 0 as it trains
 Raffix: moin
 TipuTare: can u sort a string?
 Uljahn: nah, in python strings are immutable, but you can convert string to list, sort it and join
 TipuTare: ok
 Marchete: any NN expert? I'm trying an Hex filter for Conv2d
 Marchete: I think that this constraint:
 Marchete: class HexGrid3x3(tf.keras.constraints.Constraint): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66232a01-45bb-48ab-adbb-7458e0fd488a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66232a01-45bb-48ab-adbb-7458e0fd488a</a>
 Marchete: and this:
 Marchete: model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters=5,kernel_size=(3, 3),kernel_constraint=HexGrid3x3(),strides=(2,2),name='Conv1', activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
 Marchete: could work
 Dukat: In code clashes, java code is always so long. so always auto lose?
 dbdr: Dukat: yes. use the right tool for the job
 RoboStac: Marchete - whats the stride for? Your constraint looks like you are doing the none-sparse layout that recurse used, but the stride suggests you are trying to do the sparse version (which stride won't work for as you are still using every row / column)
 Dukat: ok thanks
 Wontonimo: Marchete, that hex constraint looks like it should work.
 Wontonimo: you can verify that it enforces the constraint by checking your kernel after training to see that values on the forbidden region are unchanged
 derjack: hex conv :thinking: i bet its for Yinsh
 Wontonimo: I approached hex a little differently, before there was a kernel constraint in tensorflow.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wPRcxwGcQR7ORGdepeDTYAfot0nMc7cB">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wPRcxwGcQR7ORGdepeDTYAfot0nMc7cB</a>
 ja_fica: MSmits did you just added a counter book in C4 for roboStac xD?
 derjack: oO
 struct: no one will code a NN for yinsh derjack
 derjack: unless it becomes another potw
 Marchete: weights seem logical, zeros on corners
 Marchete: stride is just for testing it
 Marchete: it should be 1 always
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah! Zero on corners! With a donkey hat!
 Marchete: Smits don't add countebooks anymore
 Marchete: afaik
 ja_fica: He might just have updated the book but it sure worked, from 50% win to 90% to robostac
 darkhorse64: He pulls a spell on you with his grimoire
 MSmits: i did not
 MSmits: i just went from 45 million to 65 million games played
 derjack: back to meta mcts eh
 MSmits: just until i am ready for the oware one
 MSmits: but got back into D&amp;B for a while
 MSmits: jrke's fault
 MSmits: he found a bug in my solver and it took me 2 days to fix it. Then I was hooked again :P
 MSmits: I feel 99% sure C4 move 1 is a draw now btw
 ja_fica: you use single thread?
 MSmits: 10 threads
 ja_fica: you join maps after?
 MSmits: when it's exploring a particularly deep branch that solves to draw, it plays 100 games/second
 MSmits: oh D&amp;B?
 MSmits: i thought you meant c4
 ja_fica: i mean C4
 MSmits: what do you mean join maps?
 ja_fica: where you store the state-move results
 ja_fica: not in a transition table?
 MSmits: ohh, the meta mcts tree, yeah 
 MSmits: the tree has transposition tables
 MSmits: the games that are run from the leafs dont
 MSmits: in fact the tree is a giant dictionary
 MSmits: so basically a perfect TT
 ja_fica: I guess you dont use transposition table in the C4 submition
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: well
 ja_fica: its not worth it
 MSmits: the book does
 ja_fica: yes
 MSmits: but the search doesnt
 MSmits: book has 25171 moves in it
 ja_fica: unordered_map are much faster but even then it is not worth it because the keys requires to be at least 72 buts
 ja_fica: *bits
 derjack: buTTs
 Marchete: butts :D
 MSmits: why 72?
 Marchete: so you are near to solve C4, Smits?
 MSmits: no
 ja_fica: 63+9
 Marchete: why didn't you use an standard solver?
 MSmits: might not be possible with my setup
 Marchete: like pons or fhourstones88?
 MSmits: oh, this way i also have an opening book
 derjack: do they work for 9x7?
 ja_fica: 63 for player0 players 0 for the next move
 MSmits: mmh
 ja_fica: *9 for the next move
 MSmits: not sure how that math works ja_fica
 ja_fica: it is enough to represent a unique state
 MSmits: my naive expectation is you need 3^63
 ja_fica: all you require is p0 board | possible moves
 MSmits: oh right, because the rest is filled
 ja_fica: yes
 MSmits: I store it in a 128 bit datatype
 MSmits: you dont need to know who's turn it is btw
 MSmits: you can just flip
 MSmits: so that it's always player 0's turn
 ja_fica: yes, i do that as well
 ja_fica: Im trying to compress keys in 72 bits to be able to store more moves
 MSmits: btw there are some tricks with TT i could use that I am not
 ja_fica: what is TT?
 MSmits: transposition tables
 ja_fica: Oh, using indexed memery in array is better
 Marchete: books are cheating :P
 MSmits: for example, if a cell can no longer be part of 4 in a row
 MSmits: I counter with: nn's are cheating :P
 Marchete: :rofl:
 MSmits: say you invent a 3rd type of color
 MSmits: "black"
 MSmits: all cells that can no longer be part of 4 in a row are black
 MSmits: then it doesnt matter which color they really are
 MSmits: so you have less possible states
 ja_fica: I'm really having trouble to transfer data to CG environment using base 65536
 Marchete: why?
 ja_fica: You are right
 MSmits: I am thinking of redoing my c4 at some point to include black
 ja_fica: If well performed it may be possible to fit on a 64bits
 MSmits: well i dont know if it will be possible ot do that
 MSmits: but you will for sure have less states
 Marchete: I use base16k instead of base65536, it seems better
 MSmits: that doesnt mean it can be efficiently stored though
 MSmits: Marchete sometimes base 65536 is conveneint
 MSmits: i can use a single character to store 10x bandas endgame result
 MSmits: 3^10 &lt;  65536
 Marchete: I assume you seend a binary file, no matter what's inside
 MSmits: nope
 Marchete: ahh then no
 MSmits: i dont even know how to do that
 MSmits: i just take out invalid characters
 Marchete: for binary base16k compress better for CG
 MSmits: during conversion
 MSmits: Marchete why is that?
 Marchete: empirical tests
 MSmits: i didnt mean i didnt believe you
 derjack: because family
 MSmits: i just meant why :P
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary/tree/base65536">https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary/tree/base65536</a>
 Marchete: compressed less than mine
 Marchete: because unicode it seems
 Marchete: maybe CG treats some codes differently
 MSmits: no idea... but that agade thingy is linux only&#160;:(
 Marchete: maybe it wasn't an extensive test
 Marchete: WSL is your friend
 MSmits: definitely not messing with VMs if i dont need to
 ja_fica: MSmits dont like linux?
 Marchete: it's not a VM
 Marchete: well it is
 Marchete: but it's seamless
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: well i'll check it out at some point maybe
 Marchete: just install and it's like a cmd window
 Marchete: ezpz
 struct: I would try it
 struct: my c++ code even runs faster there
 Marchete: use WSL2
 MSmits: ja_fica i have no preference, but i know windows and i dont feel like devoting any brainspace to learning other operating systems
 Marchete: it seems better
 struct: so you probably can play more games per sec
 struct: faster book
 Marchete: yeah, and faster than VS C++
 MSmits: how much faster is this?
 RoboStac: yeah, a lot of base65536 characters count as 2 on cg because it's utf-32 and cg is utf-16
 ja_fica: I never use windows, you can acess bots file and reinstall OS in minutes without losing any files
 Marchete: it's more typing typing typing
 Marchete: no mouse and such
 ja_fica: I have windows because video editing and Visual Studio is a must
 MSmits: i like my mouse&#160;:)
 ja_fica: you have microsoft mouse?
 MSmits: yeah VS for sure
 MSmits: just a mouse
 Marchete: I imagined that, Robo, that's why I always check on codegolf for new encodings
 MSmits: It's just that I had to use a ubuntu VM for a class i was doing
 struct: hard to say how much faster it is
 MSmits: that completely turned me off from VM, what a horror
 Marchete: WSL is a breeze
 Marchete: trust me
 struct: also now with wsl you can have gui
 AntiSquid: what did you use MSmits&#160;? running VM every day ...
 struct: if you are dont want to do everything from the console
 Marchete: heresy!!!!
 MSmits: dont remember, it was just crap 
 MSmits: the university shared some stuff we had to install
 Marchete: :cross:
 AntiSquid: stopped using wsl, just because i use mainly linux
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10</a>
 AntiSquid: i don't run win10 though
 ja_fica: Yes, it is linux on windows, it is not as good but problaby is as fast
 AntiSquid: is there a LSW&#160;? something better than wine&#160;? :P
 AntiSquid: occasionally having headaches with compatibility
 Marchete: better than wine? win10 with WSL2
 ja_fica: wine is bad
 AntiSquid: that complicates things, i rather look for software alternatives
 Marchete: I prefer beer, yes
 ja_fica: only thing that worked was league of legends and photoshop xD
 AntiSquid: anyone heard about win11 btw&#160;? 
 Marchete: :beers:
 BlaiseEbuth: Proton!
 AntiSquid: they try to take a bit from every other OS / platform and bring it to windows
 AntiSquid: though 10 was supposed to be last OS they release
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. But they HAVE to put another layer of shit on it.
 MSmits: wait what, no more windows after 10&#160;?
 MSmits: that would be so awesome
 BlaiseEbuth: That's what they said at 10 release...
 BlaiseEbuth: But 11 incoming
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-11">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-11</a> 
 AntiSquid: they went back on their word MSmits
 MSmits: :rage:
 AntiSquid: why mad? now you can play android flappy birds on your pc without emulator, sort of
 MSmits: why would  I want to do that
 MSmits: mobile games are crap
 AntiSquid: and chat on whatsapp with your students
 MSmits: it breaks my heart to see how young people "game" now
 MSmits: no quality 
 AntiSquid: and enjoy the limited split screen functionality which is totally not inspired by linux
 MSmits: stupid pay to win microtransaction game
 MSmits: games
 MSmits: it's sad that people prefer free over good

 MSmits: it already has leaks?
 AntiSquid: probably intentional who knows
 struct: even the iso was leaked

 eulerscheZahl: old story
 MSmits: AntiSquid why do you know so much about windows 11
 AntiSquid: 1 week = old ok 
 dbdr: just fork the repo  and start creating your own OS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows11">https://github.com/microsoft/Windows11</a>
 AntiSquid: not much at all
 eulerscheZahl: is that the new "training/easy/Nintendo"?
 ja_fica: MSmits, you use uint128_t, tuple, or pair in the keys?
 dbdr: it's the new "why would I want to run a secret program as my OS"
 Marchete: magic leprechaun bits
 MSmits: locally for my meta mcts i dont even use c++ for the meta tree. I use C#. I run C++ processes from the leafs
 MSmits: the meta tree can be slow, so i just went for convenience
 MSmits: I use a Guid datatype, which is basically just 128 bit
 MSmits: as dictionary i use persistent dictionary, which is a really simple option
 MSmits: max 2 billion items, but I am no where near that. 
 MSmits: mmh what is the quickest way to check if 2 binary files are completely equal in c++?
 BlaiseEbuth: ==
 Astrobytes: OldJohn: Your move sir&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: 'Quickest'?
 derjack: hm?
 MSmits: easiest I guess
 BlaiseEbuth: To write
 MSmits: but not too slow preferably
 BlaiseEbuth: Not to run
 derjack: hash?
 MSmits: I mean, I dump 1 million integers in a file
 MSmits: or maybe 1 billion
 MSmits: then i generate them again
 MSmits: i want to check if they are the same
 AntiSquid: check sum 
 MSmits: what does that do exactly?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah probably
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: don't wait until end
 AntiSquid: hash yes whatever you want to call it
 MSmits: it cant be approximately the same
 Marchete: ifstream A and B
 MSmits: it needs to be 100% sure 
 Marchete: start reading char arrays from both
 Marchete: cancel if different
 MSmits: they will mostly be the same though
 MSmits: if all goes well
 AntiSquid: why would you use anything else&#160;? you use checksum to make sure the file you downloaded is the one you intended to and not some modified one
 Marchete: or easy mode as AntiSquid says
 Marchete: delegate on some hash
 Marchete: and check that
 Marchete: is slower thought
 MSmits: no idea how that works, what you just described is easy mode to me
 MSmits: reading from the file and check for equality
 Marchete: certutil -hashfile &lt;file&gt; SHA512
 Marchete: it seems google says that option
 AntiSquid: it's definitely slower to compare every bit
 dbdr: it's slower to compute a hash/checksum
 MSmits: but if you dont compare every bit, how do you know if every bit is identical?
 dbdr: exactly
 AntiSquid: really dbdr&#160;? maybe depends on use case
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15118661/in-c-whats-the-fastest-way-to-tell-whether-two-string-or-binary-files-are-di/15119347">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15118661/in-c-whats-the-fastest-way-to-tell-whether-two-string-or-binary-files-are-di/15119347</a>
 Marchete: or stackoverflow
 dbdr: comparing is the fastest, esp if they are different, since you can stop early
 Marchete: the source of copilot's code :D
 Marchete: first check file size
 Marchete: as someone suggests
 dbdr: hash will use additional math operations, which are slower than a comparison
 MSmits: file size will always be the same
 Marchete: or not
 dbdr: then assert file2.size() == file2.size()
 MSmits: I am randomly generating 1 million D&amp;B boards, solving them and then running a solver with pruning, to check if the pruning doesnt change the value
 dbdr: well, with file1 too :D
 MSmits: it's sometimes hard to see whether the pruning is "lossless" in D&amp;B
 MSmits: stuff gets complex
 dbdr: D&amp;B is a perfect game to lose your mind&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: I started it
 Marchete: with a lot of graph magic
 MSmits: you did the functional programmign version
 Marchete: loops chains, etc
 MSmits: seemed interesting
 Marchete: then got bored and never finished it
 MSmits: i stopped when i beat the crazy remi 
 Marchete: my hash was from functional
 Marchete: so it accepts rotation, mirror
 Marchete: or anything that doesn't change graphs
 derjack: youre still 2nd
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i know what the nr 1 does
 Marchete: what he does?
 derjack: meth
 MSmits: to beat everyone yes
 Marchete: beat everyone else?
 MSmits: he;s counting chains
 Marchete: that's all?
 MSmits: which is a much cheaper way to guarantee winning nim game
 Marchete: pfff
 MSmits: but he loses sometimes still
 MSmits: because its not a perfect way to play
 MSmits: makes some assumptions
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/529653167">https://www.codingame.com/replay/529653167</a>
 Marchete: like what kind of assumptions
 MSmits: he thinks he won this, but thats because he won the chain counting game (nim), but not the box game
 MSmits: the larger the dimensions, the more important nim game becomes
 MSmits: 7x7 is pretty large
 MSmits: you get long chains and such
 dbdr: D&amp;B 3D?
 MSmits: so it almost always works
 Marchete: my graphs did pretty well with long chains
 Marchete: but too lazy
 MSmits: yeah to solve it, but he does some kind of search
 MSmits: maybe mcts
 MSmits: like randomly finish to endgame and then count chains
 MSmits: or something
 Marchete: mcts until you reach a count chain game I guess
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: this would increase the likelyhood of you getting a favorable endgame
 Marchete: but I disagree about "randomly"
 MSmits: it's like competing with mcts vs mc
 Marchete: there are rules
 Marchete: like chain length etc
 MSmits: well random while avoiding loony moves is all
 MSmits: dont give away boxes for no gain
 Marchete: if you categorize some chains
 MSmits: yeah I know. I use these simple 1's:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f48e23c-2c5d-4314-8bfa-e47d6b1b0891">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f48e23c-2c5d-4314-8bfa-e47d6b1b0891</a>
 MSmits: and then for complex structures i have a uint64_t box map
 MSmits: this is basically a graph
 MSmits: i disconnect and reconnect stuff while solving with ab minimax + TT
 MSmits: well the boxmap corresponds  to arrays of strings and joints too
 MSmits: (strings are non-grounded chains)
 MSmits: so much D&amp;B lingo, it's even used differently between papers, quite confusing
 dbdr: it's a conspiracy
 MSmits: sometimes a long chain is 3+, sometimes 4+, sometimes a loop is a closed chain
 MSmits: etc.
 dbdr: long long chain&#160;;)
 MSmits: or that 
 dbdr: long_chain_4_t 
 Marchete: some example of my chains output
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11351ff2-fe16-46cb-b9d1-dc36f55a0a40">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11351ff2-fe16-46cb-b9d1-dc36f55a0a40</a>
 MSmits: is this exactly like the FP paper in Haskell?
 Marchete: I can't remember
 Marchete: I categorize by ground chaing, loops, 3 way, daisy? or whatever was called
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3ee47e1-9b88-4177-bddd-0da68c6248d7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3ee47e1-9b88-4177-bddd-0da68c6248d7</a>
 MSmits: a link is a connection between joins and  a join has at least 3, sometimes 4 links
 MSmits: i dont have any of the simple objects in my graph, they are just a number
 MSmits: so like I have 2 3-chains or 5 long chains
 Marchete: I also remember I had some autocuts for reduce intermediate steps that are just "free" for one of the players
 Marchete: and such
 Marchete: but still not a search
 MSmits: btw if the map has only simple objects you dont even need a search
 MSmits: you can just calculate the value
 MSmits: and the best move
 Marchete: I don't have it yet
 Marchete: I need that calculation
 Marchete: but I know it can be done
 MSmits: I dont mind sharing that, it's a bit complicated though
 Marchete: share then :D
 MSmits: allright, sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/EZmnSumD">https://pastebin.com/EZmnSumD</a>
 MSmits: mind you, only 0,3% of all endgames contain only simple objects on a 7x7 map
 MSmits: so 30 out of 1000 ( i tested)
 MSmits: what i do is, i search until all complex objects are gone
 Marchete: I know
 MSmits: and then i lookup using this function
 Marchete: yes, it's for that point
 MSmits: the comments "corollary" refer to the paper i dug through
 MSmits: i used the resulting formulas
 MSmits: so you can check it yourself with the paper
 MSmits: it makes no sense from just the code
 MSmits: and even with the paper it will not make much sense, but at least you can check it :P
 Marchete: I've read all these papers
 Marchete: I just didn't coded the simple object solver
 MSmits: I checked the formula from hundreds of games on the leaderboard, predicts perfectly
 Marchete: nice
 Marchete: thanks!
 MSmits: i found 1 error in the paper
 Marchete: I can share you a NN bot, but shhhhh!
 Marchete: it's a secret!
 MSmits: yeah i got that
 MSmits: thats the only reason i share this now&#160;:)
 Marchete: what bug?
 MSmits: oh, its a definition of modulus
 MSmits: they assume somewhere that { 2, 4 } is what you get when you do mod 4 and take the even results
 MSmits: but that's { 0, 2 } ofc
 MSmits: it's a bit weird
 Marchete: I got fun creating the graphs, identifying structures and such
 Marchete: but got bored at search
 Marchete: maybe I'll retake it someday
 dbdr: MSmits it's just math convention 0 == 4 (mod 4)
 Marchete: maybe while NN training of a future C4 bot :D
 MSmits: really? I never knew dbdr
 dbdr: so you can call it 4
 MSmits: well that explains that then
 dbdr: in math mod is not a function, it's a relation
 MSmits: the fun for me in D&amp;B is taking the solver and adding all sorts of checks to fix the order of opening chains and such so that it becomes faster. 
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: been a while since i came across that for work
 Marchete: opening chains by type, then by order
 Marchete: it's not that hard with graphs
 MSmits: well it's not hard with simple chains and loops
 KiwiTae: BlaiseEbuth hell o/
 MSmits: try it with complex objects
 MSmits: like a join with a 1 chain, a 2 chain and 2 long chains
 Marchete: that' the role of MCTS/search
 Marchete: but on a 3-way
 Marchete: I know where to cut
 MSmits: how would you know
 MSmits: say it's a 1, a 3 and a 6
 MSmits: connectd
 MSmits: it seems like it would have to be the 1
 MSmits: but I checked it and sometimes it's not
 Marchete: I know that I have a 3-way with the lengths of each arm
 Marchete: or if grounded
 MSmits: say all 3 are grounded
 MSmits: 1, 3 and 6 connected to 1 join
 Marchete: the one that makes the remaining long chain the longest for me
 BlaiseEbuth: Hell KiwiTae \o/ But why&#160;?
 KiwiTae: to distract you while you clash ~
 MSmits: Marchete you would think so, but sometimes it seems it's better to open the 3. If you already know you cant gain control due to other objects on the map
 MSmits: taking the 3 forces the opponent to give up 2 boxes to keep control
 MSmits: so you still wont get control
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't, so you are going to have a hard time :p
 MSmits: but you will have 2 more boxes
 Marchete: maybe you are right
 MSmits: i am not 100% sure, but there are a ton of exceptions like this
 Marchete: but as I know arm length in 3 way chains
 Marchete: it's a matter of calculation
 Marchete: I don't think so
 MSmits: btw, you are 100% correct that it's better to take shorter chains first if they are all 3+
 Marchete: Imo it depends on ground
 Marchete: or if a three chain is loop + ground chain
 Marchete: but a simple 3 way with all grounded
 Marchete: I think it's solvable and direct
 Marchete: anyways I wasn't at that point, or I forgot
 MSmits: I am not 100% sure, before i was getting different results if i made assumptions there. But I had 1 bug jrke spotted for me, maybe i should try it again
 Marchete: you are 2nd
 MSmits: it's not about the rank&#160;:)
 Marchete: I'm pretty sure you studied better than me
 MSmits: oh ok
 Marchete: but my graphs were beautiful
 MSmits: yes, i went nuts on this game
 _dhiva_: nuts?
 MSmits: well codewise your graphs are probably prettier
 Marchete: codewise I doubt it, but as board representation they are
 MSmits: ah well then mine are beautiful too&#160;:)
 Marchete: :S
 MSmits: I still struggle with repeated code
 MSmits: after all those years coding
 MSmits: sometimes i have a function and another function is almost exactly the same except for 1 line in the middle somewhere
 MSmits: it's annoying
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1a37d329-ceb8-48d3-8b62-862c2bf989e0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1a37d329-ceb8-48d3-8b62-862c2bf989e0</a>
 Astrobytes: Refactoring can be annoying but it's often helpful&#160;;)
 MSmits: ohh strings and coins&#160;:)
 Marchete: aye
 MSmits: thats not an endgame i think though?
 Marchete: no
 MSmits: Astrobytes yes, but sometimes it's just very hard
 Astrobytes: That too&#160;:)
 MSmits: one thing that always seemed annoying is when i have a minimax and it's split up over many functions and I need to get the best move out of it
 MSmits: the value is easy, thats returned from the base negamax function
 Astrobytes: there are multiple ways of doing that
 MSmits: yeah but usually just copy all the functions and add in some way to get the best move
 MSmits: but thats a ton of duplicate code
 MSmits: the move thingy is just for the depth 0 version
 MSmits: the rest runs the simpler version
 Astrobytes: you can iterate over available moves and score each one, bestMove can be a pointer etc etc
 MSmits: well thats the thing, i do score each one, but i dont get the best move, because i dont need it
 MSmits: and a move in D&amp;B is a very complicated thing
 MSmits: it's picking a simple chain or a graph object
 Astrobytes: yeah for D&amp;B, I don't like that game
 MSmits: so i dont want a bunch of ifs in every call of my negamax
 MSmits: just because i need to get the best move for my depth 0 layer
 MSmits: so i end up duplicating everything with a slight modification to get the best move, it's so ugly
 MSmits: I wonder if there is some way to use the ifs without loss of performance, some const&#160;?
 MSmits: say you give the bool depth == 0 as a const to the function?
 Astrobytes: you can pass in some parameter I guess
 Marchete: templates
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you could template it
 Marchete: but I don't think that's possible
 MSmits: how would this work in templates Marchete, i only know how to use them with different types
 Marchete: but a template remove if's
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Astrobytes: might be workable, templates are voodoo
 Marchete: what do you want exactly?
 MSmits: I want at depth 0 to run a negamax that finds the best move and at higher depths i want to run the exact same negamax but it ignores the moves (just gets the best value)
 dbdr: MSmits one thing you can do is keep track of the principal variation as part of negamax. that can be useful for move ordering
 Astrobytes: ^
 dbdr: and it gives you the best move
 Marchete: do you use some bool to difference it?
 Marchete: then add it as a template&lt;bool&gt;
 dbdr: it's also nice for debugging / investigating
 Marchete: with &lt;false&gt; for one thing
 Marchete: and true for the rest
 Marchete: same code
 Marchete: but that conditional is "solved" at compile time
 MSmits: dbdr i dont have move ordering because it's not iterative
 MSmits: but sure for investigation is great
 MSmits: Marchete that seems a great solution
 dbdr: move ordering helps perfs a lot
 MSmits: yes but it's a solver
 dbdr: by increasing the cuts
 MSmits: how would it use move ordering when it only ever visits a node once
 MSmits: and then uses TT to look up the value if it visits again
 MSmits: (and immediately return)
 dbdr: it's the order you visit the children
 MSmits: yes but you dont visit the children again
 MSmits: it's a solver, not a minimax search
 MSmits: so i visit once, store the value and next time i get to the node i already know the answer
 MSmits: if it was iterative, then next time i would go to greater depth
 dbdr: I thought you were talking about minimax in general, and the problem of depth 0
 MSmits: well i guess i was yes, sorry. I have my D&amp;B solver in mind too much&#160;:)
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/SMNAOnE">https://tech.io/snippet/SMNAOnE</a>
 Astrobytes: that's what I thought too tbh
 MSmits: yeah i was unclear. It's true yes I do use TT with move ordering and such in some cases
 MSmits: and then it doesnt matter, indeed
 dbdr: SMNAOnE, could be a hash, could be the acronym of the lastest search algorithm&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: that's great Marchete
 MSmits: this will shave off like 300 lines from my D&amp;B bot :P
 Astrobytes: you didn't know about that MSmits?!
 MSmits: i did have templates in the back of my mind and that they could do stuff like that. I just never went into it much. Only time i used it was for different datatypes
 MSmits: say a function that accepts 32 bit or 64 bit
 Astrobytes: Sure, they're really handy tbh
 MSmits: yeah, but it's also a higher level of thinking
 MSmits: not trivial&#160;:)
 dbdr: f(int bits, uint$(bits)_t data)
 Marchete: as I said, don't worry about that conditional, it's done at compile time
 MSmits: whats that
 Marchete: so it's performant
 MSmits: yeah, thats what i was hoping for Marchete
 dbdr: i'm trolling. it's kinda dependent types, earthly languages don't support that
 MSmits: oh ok
 dbdr: types that depend on values
 MSmits: well could have convinced me
 dbdr: C++ is crazy enough&#160;:)
 MSmits: from the fact that there is no mention of swag on your profile, i conclude you didnt win the contest? What rank did you end at?
 dbdr: #3
 dbdr: so technically I'm a winner&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's not a bad result, too bad about moscow
 MSmits: what was the prize for 3?
 dbdr: yeah, no worries, was fun, moved on&#160;:)
 MSmits: it was the swag bag wasn't it
 MSmits: maybe I jinxed it
 dbdr: "We will be in touch shortly regarding your prizes."
 MSmits: i wonder how often people dont get their prizes with these contests
 Astrobytes: Hopefully they're faster than RAIC lol
 MSmits: euler is still waiting for a robot
 dbdr: that bot is waiting to solve C4
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm not
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote that one off
 eulerscheZahl: waiting for 2 tshirts, 1 hoodie and a smart watch still
 MSmits: damn
 Marchete: lol I got a better prize for solving Numbershifting :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: indeed, 130€ refund :D
 MSmits: huh?
 MSmits: did you have a prize euler?
 Marchete: indirect prize
 Marchete: not him
 MSmits: oh
 Marchete: I can't tell
 dbdr: blackmail money
 Marchete: crypto money :D
 MSmits: ahh NDA huh
 eulerscheZahl: but can I tell marchete?
 Marchete: nope
 Marchete: :D
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 dbdr: yes
 Astrobytes: awww, you've piqued our interest now
 eulerscheZahl: if he says no, i respect that
 eulerscheZahl: and you know how hard it is for me to keep anything to myself
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: not really
 eulerscheZahl: keeping tryangle catch secret was a torture for me
 MSmits: I can see that
 Marchete: I don't know it
 MSmits: wow VS is making demands on me if i use templates
 MSmits: "provide template sample arguments for intellisense"
 eulerscheZahl: parsing error. if =&gt; when?
 struct: ignore it 
 dbdr: pushy
 MSmits: what is this magic euler?
 eulerscheZahl: "wow VS is making demands on me if i use templates"did you mean"wow VS is making demands on me when i use templates"
 <b>**eulerscheZahl struggles to understand your sentence</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: the 2nd
 Astrobytes: If you see euler do "parsing error" you must clarify or correct your statement
 eulerscheZahl: in German we have "wenn" for both "if" and "when"is it the same in dutch?
 MSmits: hmm there is some confusion in Dutch also, but maybe it's different
 MSmits: "als" = "if" 
 MSmits: "wanneer" = "when"
 MSmits: but they are used interchangably sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: as a German I would expect "als" to be "when"
 eulerscheZahl: als is a German word too
 MSmits: it has a different meaning in Dutch also
 Marchete: my example worked on tech.io MSmits
 MSmits: when you say "I am just as rich as you
 Marchete: I can't tell on VS
 MSmits: the "as" is also "als" 
 Marchete: but seems simple
 MSmits: the 2nd "as"
 MSmits: so it's also a comparative word
 MSmits: and a conditional
 MSmits: very confusing I guess
 MSmits: Marchete yeah, does forward declaration work the same with a template?
 Marchete: forward?
 MSmits: i only ever use fw declaration when i have to in c++
 MSmits: thats when you declare a function first and later specify it
 MSmits: because c++ cant read ahead like a non-handicapped programming language :P
 MSmits: i generally just put stuff in the right order so i dont have to do it
 MSmits: but when a function is recursive you kinda have to
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: I think it works the same
 MSmits: kk good, thanks again, this is nice
 MSmits: hmm so the compiler derives all the possible functions you are using by looking at the code
 MSmits: so you could easily create thousands of functions this way and trip up the compiler
 MSmits: with a bool it's easy, but if you used an int...
 Marchete: check recurs_e's postmortem for Code4Life
 eulerscheZahl: reverse RNG seed?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: extensive use of templating
 dbdr: MSmits it's creating the versions of the function when they are called
 dbdr: so only those actually used
 dbdr: and the argument must be a constant
 Marchete: yes, it must be a constant
 MSmits: yea that makes sense
 MSmits: yay my bot went from 2.9k lines to 2.6k lines :P
 struct: Do people prune actions while expanding on bt?
 MSmits:  dont but my bot is weak
 MSmits: I dont
 eulerscheZahl: yes, with a prune array
 dbdr: what's bt?
 struct: breakthrough
 dbdr: aha&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: i had to learn that too
 struct: do you use mcts there dbdr?
 eulerscheZahl: and i still hate acronyms
 dbdr: yes struct
 dbdr: I'm not sure I prune though. that's an old bot
 struct: still it seems strong
 MSmits: dbdr is this mcts with eval?
 Ninjapig28: :rage:
 MSmits: who would have thought, my D&amp;B bot crashes when I paste it into C4 IDE
 eulerscheZahl: no, i would expect it to crash only when you hit "play"
 MSmits: lol ok
 MSmits: the annoying thing is me going over the code for several minutes trying to figure out why&#160;:)
 jacek: i dont 'prune'. just prove win/loss earlier
 darkhorse64: jacek: are you using NN eval + mcts, or MM&#160;?  
 jacek: MM?
 struct: minimax
 jacek: minimax? what year is it?
 jacek: i use mcts + NN
 darkhorse64: I asked the question because MM could be more efficient in endgames for finding winning combinations (transpositions, quiescence search)
 darkhorse64: thanks
 Redlin_Kirill: automaton2000
 Automaton2000: could the validators in the repo not have been in a convenient format ffs...
 Marchete: lol minimax is so 2019
 Marchete: mcts is so 2020
 DomiKo: NN is so 2021?
 Marchete: indeed
 struct: whats next
 Westicles: quantum calabi yau nets
 dbdr: MSmits, no, rollouts, with some endgame lookups
 MSmits: ahh ok
 dbdr: hey _Royale, in sub in oware&#160;:)
 MSmits: man... Marchete created a monster 
 Marchete: who? royale?
 Marchete: I'm not sure it's NN

 MSmits: pretty sure its NN
 MSmits: oware booking is particularly hard
 Marchete: but dbd_r and jolindie_n are :D
 Marchete: dbd_r with just 2hrs of training
 Marchete: that seems pretty good
 MSmits: why are you avoiding dbdr ping
 MSmits: he's here :P
 Marchete: but then he is using a C++ packer
 Marchete: C#, Rust and C++ packers now :D
 MSmits: nice
 Marchete: I avoid 3rd party pings
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: but hey, you guys helped me beat re curse I suppose :P
 MSmits: I am above 2 NN's at least
 MSmits: I feel good about being among the NN bunch
 dbdr: 'Curse is NN?
 BlaiseEbuth: jolindien, dbdr and reCurse you mean?
 MSmits: yes dbdr
 Marchete: but MSmits you are being condescendent
 MSmits: he never wrote a normal bot for oware
 Marchete: your counterbook can wreck any NN bot
 Marchete: at least most of us
 dbdr: normal :D
 Marchete: that are very deterministic
 MSmits: but i didnt counter you or jolindie n
 Marchete: because you don't want to
 _Royale: dbdr: haha you should see me a lot I am spam submitting&#160;;-)
 MSmits: thats true
 Marchete: it's NN _Royale?
 _Royale: Marchete: it's NN
 MSmits: well also i would eventually run out of codespace with so many NN's
 Marchete: I'm intrigued
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: thanks, I was very curious
 Marchete: damn, 41+ score&#160;:(
 MSmits: _Royale is it mokka or your own version?
 _Royale: I was using NN before but only for the value, recent posts in the forum motivated me again (reCurse PM, robostac, Marchete, etc) thank you guys
 MSmits: ohhh it was already NN
 Marchete: but jace_k uses value only :D
 Marchete: good to know
 MSmits: jace_k is pretty specialized though
 MSmits: he had a LOT of practice
 MSmits: so the method can be inferior while the implementation is superior
 Marchete: I had zero practice yet I pulled it a good bot
 Marchete: against all odds
 MSmits: the odds were not so bad, only you think so&#160;:)
 MSmits: I had complete confidence
 _Royale: MSmits: my own version
 dbdr: it's pretty intimidating at first
 Marchete: you said to try a simpler thing
 dbdr: many moving parts
 Marchete: and I insisted on that
 MSmits: of course, because you were frustrated
 MSmits: it helps to do simpler things
 Marchete: I still have sign problems
 MSmits: gives you feeling of success
 Marchete: I struggled a lot and left it "when it worked"
 MSmits: yeah and now we can skip a lot of your issues, it's nice
 MSmits: oware is a proper NN testbed now
 Marchete: or improve them
 dbdr: 		//NOTE: I had soooo many problems with the signs, I won't touch anything because it seems to work right now.		//NOTE: This failed.....		//if (idToPlay == 0)			//nVal = -nVal;
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: I manually had to bypass the NN and add the heuristic eval
 Marchete: then check MCTS tree, samples, etc etc etc
 Marchete: a mess
 dbdr: I was wondering if you tried submitted the bot wth just the score as eval
 dbdr: to check the NN is actually clever&#160;;)
 Marchete: if any of you can fix that part (replay buffer -&gt; sample -&gt; train -&gt; Select)
 Marchete: I'll be happy
 Marchete: no MCTS?
 dbdr: what's broken?
 Marchete: signs
 dbdr: MCTS, with score instead of NN
 Marchete: I tried to use heuristics, yes
 dbdr: basically value NN -&gt; linear function of score
 Marchete: but the policy part doesn't worked fine with children's scores
 dbdr: is there a combination of policy and visit counts to chose children?
 dbdr: did not check that part yet
 Marchete: I just tested that, eval parent + all children
 Marchete: and normalize children scores as policy
 Marchete: maybe I did the sign wrong
 Marchete: but didn't worked out
 Marchete: "it should work" but I was tired of signs
 jacek: so score didnt work, -score didnt work, but --score worked?
 Counterbalance: relu or tanh?
 dbdr: just brute force all the signs&#160;;)
 _Royale: I was naive and thought NN would mean less magic numbers to tune... now I have even more parameters to adjust and I don't understand most of them :D
 Marchete: I'm in the same boat
 Marchete: luckily NN's can learn without CGBenchmark, it seemed crippled
 Marchete: I got limited even with simple tests on IDE
 BlaiseEbuth: _Royale and Marchete are in a boat...
 Marchete: :ship:
 struct: petition to ban NNs!
 Marchete: and minimax and mcts too! 
 Marchete: pure if only
 dbdr: branchless
 jacek: and no classes, only structs. dont hide anything
 dbdr: Save Model gen0038.h5./CGZero pitplay 6 400 gen0038 2.0 0.0 2.0 2000 0.03 1.0 0.0006 0.02 0.45 0.55 10 5 gen0036 2.0 0.0 2.0 2000 0.03 1.0 0.0006 0.02 0.45 0.55 10 5[1]    252222 killed     ../src/cgzero
 dbdr: murder!
 struct: you are also doing NN dbdr?
 dbdr: yes, playing with Marchete's cgzero
 dbdr: hm, it looks to me like draws are just ignored in oware
 dbdr: ah no, maybe just lb lag
 Marchete: they aren't ignored, trust me
 dbdr: :D
 Marchete: with almost no losses I was 3rd...
 dbdr: well, it could be, if you mostly draws, you have very few games, so your uncertainty is high, so you are ranked low
 Marchete: and I agree, but losing a lot it's noticeable
 Marchete: drawing*
 Marchete: why it was killed dbdr?
 Marchete: a bug?
 AllYourTrees: one thing i did find was using policy + value together is a big improvement over just value. since the policy scales the exploration term of MCTS, having a good policy can make you search only the important nodes
 dbdr: no idea
 MSmits: I convinced that occasionally some of these NN's play perfectly. If it is deterministic and your bot is also, you might just draw all the time
 Marchete: it's like actor critic bots
 Marchete: they worked better than a single "score" bot
 RoboStac: jacek doesn't believe in policy though and is managing to hold second place
 Marchete: we need one heretic too
 MSmits: well oware might be a game where the use of policy is only a small advantage. Since jace k spent a lot of effort on this bot, that could explain why he's 2nd
 MSmits: even with a less effective method
 Marchete: just 0.14 diff 
 Marchete: not that much
 RoboStac: he's fairly consistently in the top amongst many games though
 Marchete: but yes
 Marchete: he holds nicely
 Marchete: jacekmax is good too
 MSmits: i dont have doubts about his value method
 MSmits: but i do have doubts about jacekmax vs ept
 Marchete: me too, but for me I tested both and  jacekmax worked better for me on oware
 MSmits: just taking the maximum seems dangerous, nn evals arent always accurate and averaging should help
 MSmits: oh, ok
 MSmits: well empirical evidence trumps all
 Marchete: averaging is important in Alphazero
 Marchete: I'm sure I have a lot of noise in NN prediction
 MSmits: wait i am confused, your current bot uses jacekmax?
 Marchete: mcts rollouts helped
 Marchete: no, I mean
 Marchete: before NN I tested jacekmax with heuristic eval
 MSmits: nn and jacekmax are not mutually exclusive
 Marchete: also mcts-ept
 AllYourTrees: whats jacekmax?
 Marchete: the former gave better results
 MSmits: not for me
 MSmits: i also tried jacekmax on oware. I got a similar ranking, maybe slightly more losses
 jacek: for me jacekmax works better in some games, in the other the ept is better
 MSmits: Marchete , afaik jacek means he uses this in concert with his NN
 jacek: eeyup
 Marchete: I know
 MSmits: and you use a form of EPT (whatever azero does)
 MSmits: azero is kind of EPT
 Marchete: but I never tried too hard the NN on jacekmax, I went Alphazero
 AllYourTrees: 0 turn ept? :D
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: very early&#160;:)
 Marchete: because jacekmax need to simulate parent + children
 Marchete: it seemed more expensive
 Marchete: maybe it's not
 MSmits: btw AllYourTrees jacekmax is just backpropagating max value instead of averaging node value
 jacek: welp you have at most 6 children in oware
 MSmits: so it's like a minimax where the tree gets deeper for good moves
 AllYourTrees: ahhh kk
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 MSmits: if was super easy to adapt a mcts ept to jacekmax
 MSmits: it
 MSmits: just had to change the selection and backprop i think
 MSmits: but params will not be fitted equally well, it's a different method after all
 Daporan: Anyone hyped for the contest tomorrow?
 MSmits: dapo!
 jacek: contest?
 dbdr: contest?
 MSmits: lol
 Marchete: contest?
 struct: its not a standard cg contest
 MSmits: Daporan just accidentally created a bunch of opposition&#160;:)
 struct: is escape contest
 struct: :p
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: i wont be joining, but wish you the best of luck Daporan
 dbdr: last minute escape?
 Marchete: but there isn't any prize, no?
 struct: dont think so
 Daporan: Isn't the goal to be as fast as possible?
 jacek: your wife must be dissapointed
 struct: yeah but its not the typical cg contest
 struct: its like an escape room
 MSmits: wait who's wife, now I am confused
 struct: and you need to do barelly any coding
 MSmits: hmm, anyone here who can barely do any coding?
 Marchete: I'd say me
 MSmits: you go escape then&#160;:)
 Marchete: if you see any contest result...
 MSmits: contests are not just about coding
 MSmits: you need obsession and time as well :0
 MSmits: I usually have the 2nd, but not as obsessed as i once was. It's pretty obvious in my contest results
 Daporan: And maybe nootropics
 eulerscheZahl: does the "contest" even have a leaderboard?
 MSmits: had to google that, but yeah Daporan&#160;:)
 dbdr: Marchete, if I just delete gen* but keep traindata, the samples will be reused, right?
 Marchete: I'd say yes
 Marchete: but I usually wipe all
 Marchete: gen*, traindata and pitresults
 Marchete: remember to delete pitresults
 Marchete: if I keep traindata is to manually retrain it
 Marchete: not with the normal loop
 MSmits: what does manually mean?
 MSmits: in this context?
 dbdr: pen and paper
 Marchete: lol
 dbdr: when you get bored...
 MSmits: oh right, for when sun is out and the cpu needs to cool
 Marchete: I mean on jupyter notebook
 Marchete: but on new lines
 Marchete: not changing generations, saving each N loops
 Marchete: things like that
 Marchete: Like
 Marchete: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64a4f5ec-d5ba-4eea-9ed4-0e4284ede786">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64a4f5ec-d5ba-4eea-9ed4-0e4284ede786</a>
 Marchete: this is for taking samples and train, but not changing generations
 Marchete: just copy lines from above
 Marchete: doing only what you need
 MSmits: so your learning rate slows down
 MSmits: reduces
 BugKiller_328: hi, everyone, how to fix this error&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: `identifier "__builtin_ia32_pdep_si" is undefined`
 jacek: use pragmas
 MSmits: hey what does that buiiltin do
 jacek: add to the top
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"
 struct: its pdep for 32 bits
 MSmits: oh, what i am using is just an alias then?
 Daporan: Where is that code from Marchete?
 MSmits: it looks different
 struct: yes _pdep_u32 returns __builtin_ia32_pdep_si
 MSmits: aha
 Marchete: github Daporan
 BugKiller_328: I've added this at the top
 BugKiller_328: #include &lt;emmintrin.h&gt;
 struct: prama before includes
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero</a> Daporan
 MSmits: Marchete wrote azero for CG and freely shared (Excepting the training part and network layout)
 darkhorse64: For every access to that repo, I lose one place in the Oware leaderboard
 MSmits: well not just you darkhorse64&#160;:)
 dbdr: unless it's you who accesses it
 Marchete: every github clone, it kills a darkhorse
 MSmits: hehe
 darkhorse64: :sweat_smile:
 jacek: BugKiller_328 add pragmas above includes
 jacek: as first lines
 BugKiller_328: pragmas line doesn't need&#160;; at the end&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: I still have problem.&#160;:(
 struct: nope
 BugKiller_328: I'm running on Visual Studio 2019
 struct: ah
 BugKiller_328: and I still have problem..
 struct: you need to enable some thign I think
 BugKiller_328: how&#160;?
 struct: project properties
 Daporan: Are the bots on the lb then differentiated due to different training method and nn architecture or have you made further improvements Marchete?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/pgh8X2b.png">https://i.imgur.com/pgh8X2b.png</a>
 struct: also those pragmas have no effect on msvc
 darkhorse64: on vs, you need #include &lt;intrin.h&gt;
 Marchete: use immintrin
 MSmits: Daporan Robo, jace k and agad e are of different type. I think the other NN's are currently derived from Marchete's github
 MSmits: oh and re curse also
 Marchete: I made some improvements
 Marchete: not on github
 Marchete: not very much
 Marchete: robo, jacek, recurs_e, Adag_e and royale are different
 FalINTOblivion0112: im such a noob lol
 MSmits: i am not sure if royale said his was different. He said he already had a NN, but started over. Not sure if he used mokka for that, but i thought so&#160;?
 Marchete: he said is different
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Marchete: he just saw the policy part
 Marchete: and attempted it
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: well I will copy most of your stuff when i get around to it, but will modify to get my own weird cocktail using endgame books and scoreless states
 MSmits: oh wait no, it will be more different because no policy
 dbdr: scoreless states?
 MSmits: yes, this is when the score is not part of the nn, but is instead added to the inferred result
 Marchete: this isn't just some samples?
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: if I'd do RL
 dbdr: from playout?
 MSmits: from nn "lookup"
 Marchete: Id just "create" samples with values and policies
 MSmits: you multiply by 32 or 48, then add current score
 Marchete: from your meta mcts
 MSmits: yeah that could work as well Marchete
 MSmits: i am not 100% sure yet what i will try, maybe several things
 MSmits: the reason i would like scoreless states is that the "best move" that maximizes score is not dependent on past captures
 MSmits: so in some sense you simplify the network without losing information
 Daporan: cool work Marchete
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: Daporan did you get into machine learning for contests or otherwise?
 Daporan: yes
 MSmits: ahh ok, you didnt for the pod racing contest you won a few months ago
 MSmits: right?
 MSmits: I thought that was just uct forest
 MSmits: which you can technically combine with ML
 MSmits: (this was done on csb)
 Daporan: I thought it would be easier for me to do well without, though I considered it
 MSmits: it's a big gamble anyways
 MSmits: btw Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236661788_Playing_simple_loony_dots_and_boxes_endgames_optimally">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236661788_Playing_simple_loony_dots_and_boxes_endgames_optimally</a>
 MSmits: thats where my "corollaries" and such come from, for the solver
 MSmits: just look at the results, not the proofs, unless you want your brain to hurt
 MSmits: dbdr, these two draws:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/568674079">https://www.codingame.com/replay/568674079</a>
 MSmits: guess how deep my book went there
 dbdr: all the way?
 MSmits: frame 56 and I never tried to counterbook you :P
 MSmits: there really arent that many good branches i guess. Small branching factor, only 1 or 2 good moves per turn. Makes for really deep books even if not counter books
 dbdr: do you target your book at specific situations? or just let your metamcts run longer?
 MSmits: when i was countering the other NN's i was focusing through their chosen nodes
 MSmits: other than that i just let it run for longer
 MSmits: it could just be that you're copying the behavior of other NN's without trying
 MSmits: and i already counterbooked those a year ago. 
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 MSmits: 4 draws in a row, yeah seems fishy :P
 jacek: daFishy
 MSmits: 6 draws now&#160;:)
 jacek: see, within few hours of training he learned your book
 MSmits: I am guessing you play the same game over and over
 MSmits: lol!
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: it's definitely more efficient
 jacek: cgzero doesnt use any randomness during play?
 dbdr: there is dirichlet_noise_epsilon
 dbdr: so it can at least
 MSmits: all games are either 118 frames or 76 frames depending on who is player 1
 MSmits: so i am guessing you are playing exactly 2 different games vs me
 jacek: dbdr but only in training?
 dbdr: just won one&#160;:)
 1zanie: hello world
 FalINTOblivion0112: my programming skills are kinda sus
 dbdr: jacek, that one is zero by default, but _dirichlet_noise_alpha isn't
 MSmits: the one you won only got to frame 9 in the book
 FalINTOblivion0112: some of the reverse ones are so sus
 BlaiseEbuth: sus&#160;?
 MSmits: superior and sassy
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 MSmits: yeah it's weird, almost like someone made it up
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/K3yxE5U.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/K3yxE5U.jpeg</a>
 MSmits: that doesnt help&#160;:)
 dbdr: really? to me it's perfectly sus
 MSmits: does it mean suspicious?
 MSmits: it doesnt fit FalINTOblivion011 2's usage of it
 MSmits: but then again i think he just likes to say it
 jacek: google among us eh
 BlaiseEbuth: That doesn't tell us why reverses are sus...
 FalINTOblivion0112: yeah i like reverse
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't like games where social interraction is needed.
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably because I don't like social interractions.
 BlaiseEbuth: And that is probably because I don't like people.
 jacek: or games
 Aylenor: yea I agree people suck
 Marchete: dirichlet is mainly for training
 Marchete: on submit there is less noise
 Marchete: on final best move selection it was:
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L1560-L1580">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L1560-L1580</a>
 Marchete: then a mostVisited = goodMoves[ rnd.NextInt((uint32_t) goodMoves.size())].first;
 Marchete: it seems it barely works
 Marchete: there aren't similar enough scores
 dbdr: for (auto&amp; rootNode&#160;: rootNodes)
 dbdr: there are several roots?
 dbdr: :thinking:
 Marchete: and some value noise
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L1800-L1804">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L1800-L1804</a>
 Marchete: there aren't
 Marchete: it comes from smitsimax :D
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: it's like our useless DNA
 Marchete: ...or not
 Marchete: who knows :D
 Marchete: I think Alphazero doesn't invalidates smitsimax
 Marchete: invalidate*
 Marchete: you'll see tons of useless code like that
 Marchete: btw thanks for pushing me up
 jacek: :E
 Marchete: :grin:
 dbdr: least I can do&#160;;)
 FalINTOblivion0112: shortest code go brrrrr
 Marchete: I'm pretty sure you can use it as reference and make a much better bot
 Marchete: gotta go
 Marchete: cya
 dbdr: :wave:

 Color-Coder: hi
 FalINTOblivion0112: the clash of code i played was so stuip
 FalINTOblivion0112: i got the answers correct but it would accept
 BlaiseEbuth: stuip this time? :thinking:
 FalINTOblivion0112: now i have the solution
 Astrobytes: stuip sus clashii
 FalINTOblivion0112: lol
 FalINTOblivion0112: but i didnt say clashii
 Astrobytes: Correct. I did.
 FalINTOblivion0112: thats facts
 FalINTOblivion0112: :joy:
 Astrobytes: dbdr: now I know the 'r' in 'dbdr' means resubmit :P
 struct: we need a clash contest
 Astrobytes: a clash of clashes
 dbdr: Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: Good work though dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: the work is mostly Marchete's so far
 Astrobytes: struct: didn't cg do those a while ago?
 struct: I think so
 struct: I was taking a break during that time
 struct: I think
 Astrobytes: It's an awesome framework eh! And the tech.io article. So much learning to do :D
 Astrobytes: Possibly struct, I can't remember tbh
 Astrobytes: Was like clash tournaments or something, I (obviously) didn't participate
 struct: doesnt make much sense anyways
 Illedan: dbdr, your Oware is just a copy of CGZero converted into Rust?
 struct: I think its possible to memorize all the clashes
 Astrobytes: Yeah or at least have a record of them
 Astrobytes: Oh hey Illedan&#160;:)
 dbdr: Illedan it's just a rust wrapper, and playing with the training
 FalINTOblivion0112: i saw a really hard clash of code
 FalINTOblivion0112: and i just kinda quit
 Astrobytes: Don't be a quitter. At least try something.
 FalINTOblivion0112: i did
 FalINTOblivion0112: and it gave me the strangest error message that exists
 Astrobytes: Which is...?
 JMAC2143: hi&#160;!
 dbdr: &gt; keyboard not found. press any key to continue
 Astrobytes: :D
 JMAC2143: :grinning:
 Illedan: Oh, you used his training?
 Astrobytes: ah Royale incoming
 dbdr: no, training has to be done
 dbdr: royale broke his bot
 Astrobytes: how?
 dbdr: I just see he's ranked lower
 dbdr: was #4 I think
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh
 Astrobytes: he's on his way back up, just all the submits today most probably
 _Royale: "community AI hiding"
 dbdr: :D
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh :D
 JMAC2143: how much thrust should I use in coders strike back
 dbdr: try different values and see what works best
 JMAC2143: like what
 dbdr: what's the range? should be in the rules
 Astrobytes: 0, 50% thrust, full thrust... use your imagination
 dbdr: negative...
 JMAC2143: ok thainks
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: win at csb using the reverse gear
 FalINTOblivion0112: me in reverse mode go brrrrr
 JMAC2143: how do you use revers mode
 BlaiseEbuth: That's cool, we're learning a bunch of new words today...
 JMAC2143: ya
 JMAC2143: but how do you use revers mode
 Astrobytes: Use the edom srever
 JMAC2143: the what

 Astrobytes: Best of luck Patrick. Batten down those hatches.
 JMAC2143: what is the max thrust number in csb
 Astrobytes: Look in the statement
 JMAC2143: how
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Using your eyes
 BlaiseEbuth: :eyes:
 JMAC2143: i mean wher is the stament
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, used to it.  weak one.  Floridians love blow jobs.
 Astrobytes: Ah, just a breeze Patrick&#160;:)
 JMAC2143: wher is the stament
 Astrobytes: JMAC2143: Um, on the left?
 JMAC2143: oh i dum
 BlaiseEbuth: dum?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The thrust value of a pod is its acceleration and must be between 0 and 100.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try 200

 BlaiseEbuth: They're all mine
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jacek: :x
 Westicles: What's a good search engine that can handle perl gibberish?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :alien:
 Astrobytes: Gotta write your own one. In perl&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I used to use the manual and cookbooks
 BlaiseEbuth: A search engine that handle perl&#160;?
 Westicles: Yeah, google strips all the characters away.  Trying to figure out what the hell this is
 Westicles: $G[abs]=$_}{$_+="@G
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh.
 Astrobytes: That's somewhat brutal
 Westicles: It works, though.  Found it on some golf site
 Westicles: For temperatures
 BlaiseEbuth: Too much time I haven't used perl...
 Astrobytes: Yeah, been a good while for me too
 BlaiseEbuth: $_ is the 'current' value
 Astrobytes: $_ is the default variable, @G is an array
 Astrobytes: the curly braces tho...
 BlaiseEbuth: $G[] is a cell of this array
 Astrobytes: yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: the "...
 Westicles: You pipe the temps into it and it spits out the right answer
 BlaiseEbuth: But why...
 Astrobytes: that has me stumped for now
 Westicles: I left a double quote off the end if that helps. 
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. That's a little more coherent
 Astrobytes: yeah, slightly
 Astrobytes: Those curlies though
 Westicles: Oh well, not really a skill I need anyhow.  I'll stick to system calls
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's explicitly dereferencing the array into strings, performing the math and dropping it back into the array with the res i think
 Astrobytes: I've not got my linux box switched on so no perl right now for me
 FalINTOblivion0112: guys i just made my own clash of code puzzle
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 FalINTOblivion0112: its really hard just saying
 Astrobytes: Something like that Patrick yeah, it's just precisely how
 FalINTOblivion0112: i really wish people can approve it lol
 Astrobytes: I don't clash so that's a no from me.
 FalINTOblivion0112: its gonna be the first clash of code series
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 FalINTOblivion0112: so there is gonna be part 1, part 2, part 3, and so on
 Westicles: Just like the cribbage guy
 FalINTOblivion0112: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/88997026584c2f8392404736b86e8f3c135bcc">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/88997026584c2f8392404736b86e8f3c135bcc</a>
 FalINTOblivion0112: you can try it
 Astrobytes: Better make puzzles then no? If you want a series. You won't get them all in a row in clashes.
 Astrobytes: I won't try it.
 FalINTOblivion0112: yeah my ideas will change
 FalINTOblivion0112: thank you for the recommendation
 MSmits: i agree, absolutely no reason to do a series
 MSmits: most people will only encounter one of them and it might as well be the last one in the series
 Astrobytes: ^
 Westicles: Normally something like that would be rejected, but the french aren't participating any more and the indian guys are approving everything
 FalINTOblivion0112: yu[
 BlaiseEbuth: Yé... a reverse...
 FalINTOblivion0112: no making a series
 FalINTOblivion0112: i am convinced
 MSmits: just make a really good clash
 FalINTOblivion0112: if you guys want to play the clash tho try it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/88997026584c2f8392404736b86e8f3c135bcc">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/88997026584c2f8392404736b86e8f3c135bcc</a>
 Astrobytes: And if you want a series then do the puzzle route, you can go from easy to expert if you wish
 FalINTOblivion0112: yup
 FalINTOblivion0112: you guys are helpful
 Astrobytes: Don't spam the link please. It's in contributions so people will see it.
 FalINTOblivion0112: ohhh im so sorry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: freaky perl circumfix syntax, cringe worthy
 FalINTOblivion0112: im new to the website so yeah
 FalINTOblivion0112: sorry for spamming
 AllYourTrees: HOW DARE YOU NOT KNOW&#160;:)
 FalINTOblivion0112: lol
 FalINTOblivion0112: i felt like i committed a crime lol
 Astrobytes: lol, ALLYOURSHOUTING
 BlaiseEbuth: Westicles, isn't there others {} outside this piece of code?
 Astrobytes: FalINTOblivion0112: lol don't worry about it
 FalINTOblivion0112: thx
 FalINTOblivion0112: imagine if the mods just reject it
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: This is what I was thinking
 Westicles: Nope.  You can run it from here
 FalINTOblivion0112: "nope, to hard"

 BlaiseEbuth: OK... Don't find any ref to this use even in the doc... :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: Same Blaise
 Astrobytes: Not sure I've ever seen that
 FalINTOblivion0112: i havent seen that either
 Astrobytes: Golfing is strange though, and perl is (ofc) strange by nature
 PatrickMcGinnisII: friendlier  *.min:{.²,-$_}
 darkhorse64: you have to get rid of the first input anyway,
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok got it.
 Westicles: I don't know how you can learn this stuff without search.  Bash is even harder, no idea how you would learn that stuff
 BlaiseEbuth: The guy use the -p option to run it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/rgs/pl-opt.html">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/rgs/pl-opt.html</a>
 Astrobytes: Like I said earlier, for perl I used the camel book and some cookbooks when I had to use it
 Astrobytes: (and the language reference)
 Astrobytes: ahhhh
 Astrobytes: cheers Blaise
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I learned perl like 20 years ago when i was up for a job in west palm beach area, I didn't get the job and threw threw 3 books away determined to never use it again
 Astrobytes: That's around when I had to learn it Patrick :D
 Astrobytes: A baptism of fire if ever there was one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i should have set the trashcan on fire
 Astrobytes: The days when python was just something somebody in the dev room used now and then for something that nobody else understood why they didn't just use perl
 Astrobytes: We didn't just use perl as glue, (though it was for sure), but a good whack of our search engine was perl-based
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it chomps
 Westicles: We used to use it to autogenerate code from excel, but all those nice python libraries killed that
 Astrobytes: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think it's power was the variable reference as a variable $$, and a little speed...but websites did use it back in the day quite readily
 Astrobytes: We switched from mySQL to purely XML i remember, we used to have a templating system for websites/pages, perl was a godsend in that case
 Astrobytes: (XML + XSLT)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :puke:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :nauseated_face:
 Astrobytes: It had some excellent modules for web (CGI!) stuff Patrick yeah, but it was really good at being the glue and the regular expression support was second to none
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well, the old banking unix systems ... oh nevermind ... it still makes me sick
 Astrobytes: you love it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did not love dBase III and perl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it did not love me
 Astrobytes: heh, I didn't have to use that thankfully :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think y2k killed it, thankfully
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe I should be more thankful for javascript
 Astrobytes: :o
 Astrobytes: Don't get me started
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fget myweb.pl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 jacek: why im 4th :F
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in what?
 dbdr: :innocent:
 jacek: in some african game
 dbdr: I'm pulling you down a bit
 Astrobytes: making some inroads dbdr! Training is that quick?
 Astrobytes: Or some other modifications?
 dbdr: not huge improvement, but this last version seems a bit stronger
 dbdr: it probably needs more training
 Astrobytes: Yes it definitely seems more stable + stronger
 dbdr: even beat robo once :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe, don't get too cosy, he'll be back with a fix before you know it :D
 dbdr: yeah, I don't count on it&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: how many games/iters does it take to train one those?
 dbdr: this one has ~64k matches
 struct: thats not bad
 Astrobytes: at all
 dbdr: not counting the test matches
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok all the newer easy puzzles are done, i quit for today
 Astrobytes: later @PatrickMcGinnisII enjoy your wind
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when you get a NN that can train my GF drop me a line
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: breezy
 Westicles: I'm stalled on puzzles until they fix groovy.  Got to do them all
 Astrobytes: Groovy is square now eh? Guessing it's a 'low priority' job
 Westicles: Really simple stuff will go through if you submit it a few times, but that's about it.  At least as of a few days ago
 Astrobytes: Did they say what broke it? 
 Astrobytes: Oh, wait. the last languages update was it?
 jacek: people who cheat the system
 Westicles: I think it broke before that.  All they said is nobody at CG knows groovy, which is fair... I mean why would you
 Astrobytes: In that case though - why bother supporting it at all?
 AllYourTrees: is there a post about the last language update?
 AllYourTrees: i wanna see if there are any rust updates
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/223">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/223</a>
 Astrobytes: You know when there's language updates because everyone is talking about them
 Astrobytes: *there're
 Westicles: I tried to get compression working in rust.  Got a million errors about type mismatches and gave up
 Astrobytes: I get the impression that Rust hates you until you finally surrender to it.
 AllYourTrees: i &lt;3 rust
 jacek: you :heart: iron and oxygen?
 AllYourTrees: ya
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I have nothing against it at all, it's pretty damn cool. Just hard to get used to (for me at least)
 AllYourTrees: i started using it years ago when it first started coming out, definitely took a long time to be proficient lol
 AllYourTrees: and still learning ofc
 RoboStac: the early versions were a lot more painful too
 Astrobytes: I can imagine.
 Westicles: AllYourTrees, then your assignment is to unpack ASCII bytes put 2:1 into UTF-16 in under around 30 characters
 AllYourTrees: :thinking:
 RoboStac: it's definitely not a golf language
 Westicles: Yeah, in C it is literally one character
 AllYourTrees: 1 character??
 Westicles: ascii=u"UTF-16"
 AllYourTrees: so you want to take a string and convert it to utf-16?
 AllYourTrees: is there some puzzle for this or something lol
 Westicles: It is good for golf.  It counts characters instead of bytes, so you can get 2 characters into one symbol
 Astrobytes: it's golfing
 jacek: :golf:

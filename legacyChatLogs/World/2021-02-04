 MadKnight: oh wow so static inheritance works in c# too
 MadKnight: didn't know c# was really that much optimized
 MadKnight: i'd send a pic instead of that scary link but this chat doesn't support it
 reCurse: Microsoft is very serious about bringing the performance of .net on par with native
 C_Boy: people question why I use C, it still used at chip level for most embedded
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^ I use C and assembly all the time at work
 3ataja: have someone ever ranked 1st in a CoC using c :thinking:
 JLukeSkywalker: i have in a couple speed ones
 JLukeSkywalker: depends on the puzzle
 JLukeSkywalker: i will concede that python is easier though
 JLukeSkywalker: for fast coding
 3ataja: cool, c is very challenging in some puzzles
 JLukeSkywalker: finally got to gold in GoD. Not counting comments, only takes 40 lines of code lol
 VladimirAngelov: whats static inheritance
 JLukeSkywalker: java?
 JLukeSkywalker: method/etc in a class that you dont need to make an object to use
 JLukeSkywalker: instead of going object is classobject.do_stuffyou go class.do_stuff
 JLukeSkywalker: iirc
 KiwiTae: the bear is back &lt;3
 JLukeSkywalker: hate java
 ZarthaxX: KiwiTae bear? :P
 KiwiTae: its not? damn
 BlaiseEbuth: It's a cat
 KiwiTae: its soo damn cute anywayy &gt;&lt; bring the bear back
 KiwiTae: o/
 ZarthaxX: scarfield we did it
 Astrobytes: Did what?
 ZarthaxX: :rofl: i told scarfield toad would say that but well, you said it kiw oLOL
 ZarthaxX: heyo
 KiwiTae: :rolling_eyes: hehe
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes we thought ppl would not notice the change, at least kiwo fell for it
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 KiwiTae: it did look different&#160;:/ 
 Astrobytes: yo KiwiTae how's France?
 Astrobytes: (assuming you got there and started)
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes coooold i did awesome projects though
 KiwiTae: working on robots now cool stuf :D
 KiwiTae: scotland is colder i assume hehe
 Astrobytes: Hey try Scotland for cold! Awesome, that sounds great :D
 Astrobytes: Glad it went well
 Astrobytes: Pandemic be damned!
 KiwiTae: but cannot get a life here&#160;:( curfew at 6pm &gt;w&lt;
 Astrobytes: Yeah, 'it'll all be over soon' :P
 Westicles: Do they actually enforce curfews?  They had one here briefly and the cops flat out said they wouldn't enforce, so everybody ignored
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: you missed the escape thing
 Astrobytes: Westicles: In France they probably shoot you or beat you severely 
 KiwiTae: i also missed it and didnt have time to play ghostbusters
 Westicles: heh heh, those darn french
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i know i will try the first alone :D
 KiwiTae: Oo hope they not gonna shoot me im never home by curfew time ah
 TBali: you need 2 players to start escape. Of course it can be bypassed with an extra reg, but it does not make much sense alone.
 TBali: Especially the second game
 Astrobytes: ^^^^^
 TBali: team of 4 was just perfect
 Astrobytes: And you definitely need audio/video. Zoom works great.
 struct: Overall experience was good imo
 struct: I would rate it 7.5/10
 Westicles: I wonder if they'll have community contribs
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it was pretty fun
 struct: Westicles would be a nice addition
 Astrobytes: We mentioned that in our post-session chat Westicles
 Astrobytes: But can you *imagine* the approval process if it's the same as we 
 Astrobytes: have currently
 Westicles: Be tough to get all the languages to work in some automated fashion
 Astrobytes: There are already language issues tbh
 Astrobytes: instead of receiving a dictionary style input as a map, I got it as a struc t with individual variables.
 Astrobytes: (C++)
 Astrobytes: T Bali said something about the PHP input not working as intended too
 struct: I feel like it was designed for js
 struct: it worked fine
 struct: for js
 Astrobytes: Didn't check the py input, that would figure. py + js 
 Astrobytes: Wait it's set on JS as default right struct?
 struct: for me yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah I had it as well both times 
 Astrobytes: Might just be a testing thing, maybe stubs are not working as intended rn
 ZarthaxX: everrything is on fire astrobyto
 Wontonimo: any suggestions for a fast array in C++ that is dynamic in length?  It will be at most 81 elements ... 
 ZarthaxX: static array? lol
 Wontonimo: i'm thinking just allocate 81 static 
 Wontonimo: great, I'm going to assume you are not be sarcastic.
 ZarthaxX: 81 elements is so little, idk what are you gonna store there tho
 ZarthaxX: but still, plain array
 struct: seems like uttt stuff
 ZarthaxX: is this for uttt?
 Wontonimo: an int
 ZarthaxX: struct f u
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Wontonimo: haha ... yeah, it's utt
 Wontonimo: t
 ZarthaxX: you should look into bitboards Wontonimo
 ZarthaxX: faster for that game
 Wontonimo: ive got bitboards!  now more looking at storing valid moves
 ZarthaxX: operation wise, copying wise
 ZarthaxX: for mcts?
 Wontonimo: yeah, for the nodes in mcts
 ZarthaxX: u could store valid moves in a bitboard too, couldnt you?
 ZarthaxX: dude?
 ZarthaxX: F
 Wontonimo: 81, seems a bit more trouble than it is worth.
 ZarthaxX: 81 bits&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: a 128 bits
 ZarthaxX: you do you hehe
 Wontonimo: what's the data struct in c++ that'll give me 128 bits
 Wontonimo: nvm ... i'll google
 ZarthaxX: well there is a 128 bits type
 ZarthaxX: __m128i
 struct: or __int128
 ZarthaxX: you could tho divide the board maybe in 2 64s
 struct: Which is just 2 64s
 ZarthaxX: i won
 ZarthaxX: shuuuuuuut up structo
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: anyway, do you know builtins Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: nope... haven't done c++ since 1996, and it's changed a bit since then
 ZarthaxX: struct show him the pro bits thingies
 ZarthaxX: oh well, you got like an instruction that tell you the index of the first set bit
 struct: What do you mean pro?
 ZarthaxX: so that could get you the "move" index for example
 ZarthaxX: struct builtins
 Wontonimo: oh!!!  what!?! what's that instruction?
 ZarthaxX: idk if this can be avxeable :P
 Wontonimo: index of the first set bit would be super useful!
 struct: __builtin_clz
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html</a>
 struct: __builtin_ctz
 ZarthaxX: just search like this thing there Wontonimo __builtin_ffsl 
 struct: __builtin_popcount
 ZarthaxX: or this __builtin_ffsll 
 ZarthaxX: it's just the same, just another data type
 ZarthaxX: there are many tricks with bitboard
 ZarthaxX: struct what are you gonna do now that there are no more roomstobo?
 ZarthaxX: idk why i called you struct and tobo in the same sentence :thinking: sheez
 struct: Dont know
 struct: Maybe I write a boss for amazons
 Wontonimo: thanks people of CG
 struct: I think we still have the msmits function
 struct: of checkWin
 struct: let me check
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo talk with msmits when he is on
 ZarthaxX: and you are welcome&#160;:)

 struct: Was it this one ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: chess
 ZarthaxX: but that's the one
 Wontonimo: he's the teacher dude.  yeah, he is helpful
 ZarthaxX: ye, and humble
 ZarthaxX: not like me, aggressive fox
 ZarthaxX: snowy*
 struct: You are gonna do chess ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: struct we shouldnt talk about avx/sse already for him, he just started
 Wontonimo: oh, i thought you were a seal with some show piled up at your feet
 ZarthaxX: no.. im busy with stuff outside cg
 ZarthaxX: lmao :rofl: 
 struct: you said chess randomly
 struct: lol
 ZarthaxX: oh, the code you pasted is for chess, not utt
 ZarthaxX: t
 struct: whAt???
 struct: It is for uttt miniboard ZarthaxX
 Wontonimo: That code is awesome!  Inspiring
 ZarthaxX:&#160;?????
 ZarthaxX: i dont believe you
 Wontonimo: loads all 8 possible wins into a 128, and checks them all in 1 go
 struct: ^
 ZarthaxX: thought that day was about chess
 struct: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: well then&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: btw intrinsics perform so much worse than asm it sucks
 ZarthaxX: or my experimentation was wrong
 struct: Never tried
 struct: Next contest ill do it in asm
 ZarthaxX: great&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: i will go to your funeral for sure 
 ZarthaxX: *struct, the guy that tried and failed*
 struct: I fail every contest&#160;:(
 struct: LAst one was the closest one I guess
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: you rocked in the last one dude
 struct: Yeah but I keep having the same problem
 struct: I start day 1
 Wontonimo: if you do it just right, and you don't f*** it up, it just works
 struct: But I keep  rewriting until last 3 days
 ZarthaxX: so stop doing that
 ZarthaxX: have fun coding and trying all the time
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: dont even think about optimizing, just try stuff
 struct: Maybe I should do puzzles
 struct: and learn bfs dfs and such
 ZarthaxX: it would help&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: or better keep doing amazooooooooon
 ZarthaxX: ppl love your contrib
 struct: I think puzzles might be better
 struct: I might learn some stuff
 ZarthaxX: go for it then
 ZarthaxX: mah man
 Astrobytes: gn all
 struct: gn
 ZarthaxX: gn

 Cohmedy: hello laminator? can i ask a doubt?
 Lachrymosa: is there a way to disable the python assistant. It keeps popping up when I'm trying to read my code and it is getting obnoxious.
 SPDene: Lachrymosa this might help: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/409247-codingame-no-autocomplete">https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/409247-codingame-no-autocomplete</a>
 Lachrymosa: i don't mind being able to tab complete things but mousing over while I follow stuff and getting half my IDE blocked by a black box explaining libraries and stuff to me is not the move.
 SPDene: this might be the right one then <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/409702-codingame-no-signature-help">https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/409702-codingame-no-signature-help</a>
 Lachrymosa: do i have to close then open the browser to enable it?
 SPDene: you'll need tampermonkey (on chrome) or greasemonkey (firefox) installed
 Lachrymosa: ah
 SPDene: not my scripts btw - but you're not the only one who hates those popups&#160;:)
 zapakh: Ooooh thanks, I spent hours trying to track down how to get rid of those in GreaseMonkey. I thought I had it, but then it didn't work.
 winner_go: help me with happy numbers pls
 winner_go: peace deth gun done draw chilly peace door ball
 jacek: not so happy eh
 Cybersick: I am so happy
 eulerscheZahl: i am tired
 inoryy: nice bio, eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 xlr4829: how i can get two numbers that a - b = n (n is given) and they should be divisor other then 1 
 Q12: Get the list of divisors for n and then do a nested loop through the list and check if element from the outer loop minus the element from the inside loop is equal to n
 nim-ka: no, that doesn't work: a and b for n=100 have to be 104 and 4
 nim-ka: loop through k from 1 upwards until you find k such that k is composite and n+k is composite, then you have a=n+k and b=k
 Richuangangban: hello
 SnAp:                                                 
 Richuangangban: :thinking:
 jacek: wtf why this avatar is so big <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/495336279">https://www.codingame.com/replay/495336279</a>
 inoryy: lol
 eulerscheZahl: the default avatar is bigger than the user avatars
 eulerscheZahl: that's why you have to set the avatar size explicitly when you create a multiplayer game and want to show them
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/src/main/java/Onitama/view/BoardView.java#L48">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/src/main/java/Onitama/view/BoardView.java#L48</a>
 eulerscheZahl: (the auto-formatting removed some linebreaks and i didn't care enough to correct them)
 eulerscheZahl: if you forget about this...well, you've seen the result
 jacek: so we should blame those who approved it
 jacek: an obvious blocker
 eulerscheZahl: the avatar size is not part of the official checklist
 eulerscheZahl: but you should notice it when you play vs default AI
 jacek: default ai is ok
 eulerscheZahl: oh, my bad
 eulerscheZahl: but i was aware about the large avatar issue on Bandas before
 jacek: now i need to think of ways of exploiting it
 Hellivium: Hi, using JSnew Array(size).fill().map(() =&gt; readline()) , do you have any syntax to avoid the dirty .fill() without it I don't loop&#160;:/ Thanks
 N-ONE: hello world
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how did i go up 300cp overnight?  did a multi get re-figured or something?
 zapakh: Probably. I think the multis keep computing long after you submit.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, a few new subs from other players in ttt and code royale, but that didn't do it... just unusual... I expected a cp jump w/ COIF ... it's all good
 Romil: ..Everyone's code should be always showed in Clash of Code.  :/
 fm-leonardo: nah
 fm-leonardo: only the first place's maybe
 Romil: yeah.. but also consider languages.
 Romil: e.g.  if first place holder uses ruby.  2nd place has python..
 Romil: ..There is no harm in showing everyone's code.  
 Skynse: I mean, some people wouldn't want to show code
 Skynse: Since they may have copied and pasted lol
 RohanasaurusRex: lol yeah its sometimes helpful if you can see the code of people who did really well on it
 RohanasaurusRex: but i can understand if they wouldnt want to show theirs maybe
 zTTK: i don't play clash of code
 zTTK: don't like being rushed
 zTTK: just puts me in a state of panic, and i can't think
 zTTK: EVEN IN 15 MINUTES
 zTTK: :sob:
 Metanoob: yeah that's the thrill of it
 Metanoob: but healthy not to put yourself through it :p
 zTTK: yep
 zTTK: and then there is the clash of code quest map that is incomplete
 zTTK: **pain**
 Metanoob: accept defeat and embrace victory - mr douchebag wise mc connor
 Metanoob: i forgot the quotes ugh
 Metanoob: would it feel different if you were able to participate anonymously?
 zTTK: no lmfao, i don't have social anxiety
 zTTK: whenever i have to try and win, i always get pressurized and mess up
 zTTK: i guess im just clumsy
 Metanoob: so you have self pressure anxiety
 Metanoob: if that's even proper english
 zTTK: idek if thats proper english but pretty much i guess
 zTTK: i also have a tingly bit of atelophobia
 Metanoob: yeah seems to go hand in hand
 Metanoob: (had to look it up I didn't know this phobia had a name
 Metanoob: )
 zTTK: kekw
 zTTK: yeah me neither until i found it
 Metanoob: haha
 zTTK: welp imma get off now
 zTTK: been on for 6 hours now
 Metanoob: wew yeah good time for a break, see ya!
 zTTK: i have school tmr, and im coding when i have literally no passion for studying in this field
 Metanoob: damn
 zTTK: yep
 zTTK: im also a science nerd
 zTTK: welp, i'll see ya another time
 zTTK: adios
 Metanoob: well best of luck see you sometime I hope
 chinoto: @zTTK I tend to think too much when programming, so I find Clash of Code to be a good way of training myself to just bang out code and deal with polishing afterward, I am for example obsessive about performance and avoiding allocations, yet those things can wait until after I've gotten something working.
 Skynse: I sometimes overthink on school tests
 chinoto: One of the clash of code challenges was to determine the maximum number of movies one could watch given a list of show times. I basically gave up and chatted with the others in the stream I was following, then we got to see a solution to the challenge that wasn't even very long or even guaranteed to be the maximum, but it was good enough for the test cases and that's what mattered.
 chinoto: The number of showings was potentially 10^6 and could easily turn into a difficult optimization problem, which is why I gave up.
 jacek: mhm
 Skynse: haha yeah big constraints
 YurkovAS: jacek how many rollouts you have in second move in bandas? do you use ept?
 Skynse: Just got 100% in a pretty complex CoC puzzle without thinking lol
 Skynse: as in, my mind was foggy
 Skynse: dang
 Skynse: I got beaten by 46 chars
 BeardedTraveller_5a04: Are any of you guys familiar with C?
 jacek: YurkovAS about 7k, but i use eval directly, not rollouts
 Skynse: The chat is glitchy
 YurkovAS: jacek always eval (ept depth 0)?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: i have somewhat NN as eval
 YurkovAS: jacek thanks. oh nn
 Metanoob: BeardedTraveller_5a04 to a certain extent, what's your problem?
 BeardedTraveller_5a04: I'm a little confused on Don't panic case 2
 Darebon: used to be I could play past contests. did they take that away?
 jacek: past contests are multi now
 Darebon: ah, I see now. was expecting a link from the contest page
 AntiSquid: fk the UTTT LB, srsly wtf is this bs. why won't it climb Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i can give you the best of both worlds
 jacek: LB?
 AntiSquid: leaderbopard
 Skynse: this chat is glitched lol, whenever I join a new clash, all my previous clash chats are available, making the latest one hard to find
 Skynse: Is it a bug or is that intended?
 AntiSquid: idk might be something to do with the "why don't you share your coc" zombies
 AntiSquid: i don't play coc btw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darnit, I changed my zombiecode and did hella better, then only get 95% on submit...smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 days in a row
 AntiSquid: i am guessing it fails on one particular test case each time PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i had 100%, but score was lower
 AntiSquid: i'd say hardcode for the one test case
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now 95%, but better score, hence ranked lower
 PatrickMcGinnisII: changing default state for 'safety'
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 AntiSquid: dropped another 10 ranks in UTTT :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gratz AntiSquid, i fell your pain
 AntiSquid: can't get back . no experimenting allowed . but i bet a lot of the bots higher are weaker than mine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er feel
 AntiSquid: nah it's ok better fell it :P
 Skynse: what are bots on codingame?
 AntiSquid: ok . you're missing out on the main part of codingame somehow
 VizGhar: :joy:
 Skynse: I didn't feel like looking into it lol
 Skynse: but now Im interested
 Skynse: OHHHHHHH
 Skynse: Tutorial bots
 AntiSquid: what? no .
 Skynse: ._.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a> and ignore the clash on this page
 AntiSquid: i don't see clash anywhere else actually . i wonder how you missed the multis&#160;!
 Skynse: whoa
 Skynse: That looks fun
 AntiSquid: scollbars can do miracles i guess
 Majeck: Yeah bot programming is like the best part of this site
 Majeck: The fall contest will be a bot programming event
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gheesh only get 4k points more, but should move up on leaderboard
 Skynse: Gonna try some bot programming after this clash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, only 140 spots ... so much work
 Skynse: Imagine entering a contest but a bot does the work for you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still not in top 2k in leaderboard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll take it, for now... dinnertime, glhf
 Skynse: gonna play with the bot thing
 Skynse: looks nice so far
 Skynse: lol looks like my past self has already toyed with it before
 Skynse: ok this bot thing is much more fun than puzzles
 Nakilon: is there a way to see my previous codeclash games? I can't find it, didn't visit the website for a while
 LastRick: I don't think you can see your previous results but I think you can search for the parties on EulerscheZahls site: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 LastRick: *puzzles, not parties. What a weird slip.
 Nakilon: that's sad; because I wanted to see the exact match I had; I thought I shared it someone in chats but can't find anywhere
 Nakilon: the thing was how solutions of mine and my contester compared

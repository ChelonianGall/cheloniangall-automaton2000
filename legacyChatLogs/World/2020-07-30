 TrongLeDanh: it's just 2 min
 jacek: good morning
 RitamChakraborty: is it worth learning deno?
 alexandre.lavoie: Do you know node?
 Allison: How do you progress past a certain mission?  I seem to be stuck on the "Boost" part of the Coders Strike Back AI thing...
 Bob: I think you need to clarify your question
 hem123: what is a more efficient way to do power calculations in python
 hem123: every time with huge powers i get stuck
 hem123: out of time
 Uljahn: there could be a more efficient way to solve this without the need of huge powers i guess
 Uljahn: also python has memoization tool, see functools.lru_cache
 PikaYuhno: world
 LegendNeverDies: why in clash of code showing 20% even if I solved 100%?
 Jeremy1080: There are different tests run to validate to prevent hardcoding
 LegendNeverDies: which means?
 Jeremy1080: The tests you see say Input:1 - &gt; Output: 2 arn't actually run, instead it runs similar ones that will pass assuming you implemented the algorithm correctly
 Allison: @Bob I completed the test against the boss, but it won't progress me past the level and on to the next rank.  Is there something I'm doing wrong?&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Allison - did you submit your code?
 Allison: Yep. 
 Astrobytes: And did you beat the boss?
 Allison: As far as I know?  It said I did when I was testing out the code...
 Astrobytes: You need to finish above the boss in the leaderboard before you can be promoted to the next league
 Allison: Oh... hmm...
 Allison: OKi.
 Allis: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13160864d10918cde5193cd114626f77dd716bb">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13160864d10918cde5193cd114626f77dd716bb</a>
 Allis: I've only seen it happen once, but it's still messed up. I don't think a bot should crush it like this.
 Allis: Do you think it constitutes a bug?
 Astrobytes: lol, type faster :P
 Astrobytes: Seriously though, nah
 Astrobytes: I think it's fairly infrequent so, nothing to worry about
 Bob: Also, 10 seconds for a CoC is entirely plausible even for a human
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Just pretend it wasn't a bot
 Bob: some of the shortest ones *can* be typed that fast
 Astrobytes: Especially if you're familiar with the problem
 Allis: Lame.
 Astrobytes: If it was 15 s and a human, you wouldn't mind so much?
 Allis: Certainly not.
 Allis: Bots pretty much shouldn't win.
 Astrobytes: Why not?
 Allis: As I understand it, they exist to drum up activity.
 Allis: And that seems reasonable, but it should be the extent of it.
 Astrobytes: Indeed. It's inevitable that they're gonna win now and then
 StepBack13: Bots are literally just "ghosts" of humans who solved the puzzle before. So a human did beat you, just not a human who was playing simultaneously to you haha
 Astrobytes: I really wouldn't worry about it
 McCheng: I agree with StopBack13
 Allis: Ah, I didn't realize they were ghosts. That's a little more reasonable.
 StepBack13: yeah, I didn't either for ages
 Allis: If that's the case, why don't they share code?
 StepBack13: They do sometimes, I think
 Astrobytes: There's an article on the blog about it, but not sure if the blog is working properly atm
 StepBack13: I figured that they share if the human shared also
 McCheng: I have never seen bots sharing their codes though...
 LeBaoHoang8A4: yeah
 StepBack13: ahhh ok, maybe you're right about them not sharing.. 
 Astrobytes: afaik they don't share
 StepBack13: Allis, how do you solve puzzles in 15 seconds? The time it takes to swap from Python to Bash and then write bash code, surely must be more than that, haha. You're a bot!
 LeBaoHoang8A4: He is expert!
 StepBack13: Yeah, he's been beating me often lately, haha. :P
 Allis: StepBack13: In this case, it was switching from Ruby to Bash, but either way I knew exactly what I was going to type once the interface loaded. :P
 LeBaoHoang8A4: GENIUS!
 Allis: Nah, removing non-uppercase characters is trivial as long as you're using the right tool for the job.
 SaurabhNegi123: Can anyone tell the answer for coders strike back 'wood 2 league'
 SaurabhNegi123: Can anyone tell the answer for coders strike back 'wood 2 league'
 LeBaoHoang8A4: wood2?
 SaurabhNegi123: level 2
 Allis: I will say that the test cases run so much faster for Bash than Ruby. :sweat_smile:
 SaurabhNegi123: i use python 3 and in am a beginner
 LeBaoHoang8A4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa094f21-59a7-400d-a8a7-25309a1f8446">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa094f21-59a7-400d-a8a7-25309a1f8446</a>
 LeBaoHoang8A4: you can check out the link
 Astrobytes: LeBaoHoang8A4: It's generally better to give advice rather than explicit code. 
 SaurabhNegi123: hey i need answer in python 3 
 Astrobytes: Helps with the learning process
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OH, sorry!
 Astrobytes: No problem 
 Astrobytes: SaurabhNegi123: Are you proficient in Python?
 SaurabhNegi123: no i am beginner
 Astrobytes: OK, codingame kind of assumes you are comfortable with the basics of the language you are using - it's not the best for learning the basics, better for practicing
 Astrobytes: I would suggest learning a bit more elsewhere, then coming back when you feel ready
 SaurabhNegi123: i know the basics
 LeBaoHoang8A4: you can read the instructions
 Astrobytes: Then you should be able to pass Wood 2 Coders Strike Back without issue
 SaurabhNegi123: how do we know the thrust
 Astrobytes: Read the statement carefully
 LeBaoHoang8A4: in wood2, they ask you to find a thrust base on angle
 SaurabhNegi123: it is 'x y thrust' but what is that
 jrke: its output statement
 LeBaoHoang8A4: x, y: is coordinate
 jrke: target_x,target_y,thrust
 LeBaoHoang8A4: thrust is power
 SaurabhNegi123: from where do you all learn coding
 LeBaoHoang8A4: i am self learning
 Bob: self + computer science school
 jrke: How many in legend of csb have neural networking any idea?
 Bob: and then self
 Astrobytes: Self-taught.
 jrke: self 
 SaurabhNegi123: me too self 
 Astrobytes: 4 or 5 I think jrke
 Bob: neural net, probably none or extremely few
 jrke: just 5?
 jrke: means which have big lead in leaderboard
 Bob: because you need the material to train your net
 Alshock: There definitely are, bc at some point it was 2/2 within the top 4
 Astrobytes: top 4 are all NN
 Astrobytes: then it's Smitsimax after that
 SaurabhNegi123: any one from india
 LeBaoHoang8A4: no, i'm from vietnam
 AntiSquid: nobody else from india, you are the first person from india we ever met, welcome to CG, it is a great honor to have the first indian here SaurabhNegi123
 LeBaoHoang8A4: really?
 Astrobytes: No.
 SaurabhNegi123: there are many indians in CG
 AntiSquid: go check #in nobody there, only people pretending to be from india
 dbdr: AntiSquid <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/479399741">https://www.codingame.com/replay/479399741</a>
 dbdr: SaurabhNegi123 don't mind him, he's joking
 AntiSquid: looks like you lucked into a draw
 dbdr:&#160;? I won
 AntiSquid: wait, that's weird
 dbdr: colors are reversed
 AntiSquid: i only have PASS in my bot
 AntiSquid: why does it place a stone?
 AntiSquid: and how do i lose @_@
 dbdr: I wonder who validated this
 dbdr: because I placed one
 AntiSquid: uhm ok really weird
 AntiSquid: tric trac is one of the guys who validate, surprised it's bugged
 Alshock: errrrr I don't see anything
 dbdr: Statement also has pearls like:"Beside these simple rules there are a view more rules"
 AntiSquid: essigautomatfield3 - level 36 
 AntiSquid: essigauto is regular
 AntiSquid: hm ... maybe we need a way to invalidate bugged multis like these?
 dbdr: better to just fix it
 Alshock: @AntiSquid I think you lose because you don't own any zone and you played 1 more stone. Don't ask me why you placed it though
 AntiSquid: no Alshock read chat above
 Alshock: reading? I can't do that
 AntiSquid: colors are reversed, i didn't place any stone, dbdr placed it
 Alshock: aw
 AntiSquid: yes
 Alshock: wait wtf?
 AntiSquid: ikr, game is bugged i should have won, glad you agree with me, we need to report this
 Alshock: OOOOOOOOOH I GET IT
 Alshock: that's not your own colour under your names
 AntiSquid: no 
 Alshock: that says you have captured X of the OPPONENT's colour
 AntiSquid: it's bugged
 Astrobytes: the colour under your name is to indicate how many of the other colour you've captured
 Alshock: my explaination made sense... somewhat
 dbdr: yeah, not a bug it's a confusing feature
 Astrobytes: If you output your colour you should have the correct one
 Astrobytes: I agree, very confusing
 AntiSquid: but i lost, so how is it not bugged?
 dbdr: I'm black
 AntiSquid: ok i stop Automaton2000, you continue
 Alshock: Well dbdr played an not you, maybe he now owns the whole game?
 Automaton2000: and i couldn't figure out why
 dbdr: Alshock thre is no ownership
 AntiSquid: dbdr pinged me to show he won with one stone placement
 dbdr: this is Atari Go
 Alshock: maybe I should stop conjecturing without reading the rules?
 dbdr: not Go
 Alshock: but that'd be no fun
 dbdr: only captures count
 AntiSquid: you could try to extrapolate the conjecture Alshock
 AntiSquid: improved my bot and now winning vs Astrobytes:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/479403564">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/479403564</a>
 field3: When the league changes, the size of the board changes.My program hits the stars at the beginning,It may not work in Leagues 3 and 4.I can't verify it with the previous size.:disappointed_relieved:
 Astrobytes: lol, I only submitted last night to see if it was working
 AntiSquid: ^ got outskilled
 Alshock: late night submit ruining hours of work on your AI! Sad
 AntiSquid: Alshock no, astro has the default code, i just place one stone
 Alshock: and dare you pretend posting the default AI can be done with less than 10h of coding?
 Allis: Could someone clarify why people have CG alts? What's the "benefit"?
 AntiSquid: ask Automaton2000, i am his alt
 Automaton2000: does anyone know what's up with the same code
 Alshock: Hiding your identity in clash/contests? Playing multis with wood rules? Idk
 Alshock: pleasure of unlocking the achievements again?
 Alshock: the clicking game might be a good explaination
 AntiSquid: well alts are not allowed, best to avoid alts if you can, but they do have a benefit
 AntiSquid: you might want to test some code changes, some other codes and see how they work without screwing your ranking
 AntiSquid: but do avoid in contest, might get banned for it otherwise&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: also you can start over on alts, and play the game from wood again to better track your improvements, it's harder to see any differences for small improvements otherwise
 AntiSquid: would be nice if CG allowed reseting own rank on main account though and simply not reward the XP again when you promote back up imo
 Astrobytes: Or allow alt's conditionally that are associated with your main account
 JayBeAl: If i submitted a code and it is ranking, can i look up that code? Or do i have to save the code manually?
 AntiSquid: History / Results button left side
 Astrobytes: It'll be in your History/Results
 Astrobytes: ahhh
 JayBeAl: thanks a lot!
 Thyl: Yo&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Sushi
 MSmits: hey... can you do loops within loops in code of the ringS?
 MSmits: I tried it and it just says: Failure: The magic phrase is incomplete.
 MSmits: with no other feedback
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: like a double for loop
 MSmits: +&gt;[-[.-]-.+&lt;-]
 JBM: it should be possible
 MSmits: whats wrong with the one i just shared
 JBM: nothing obvious
 Allison: Quick way to check would be to use a valid code that you can try, then add a simple for i -&gt; 3 for y -&gt; 3, see if it lets you.
 MSmits: thats what i did
 MSmits: to be honest, its not the right solution, but its not telling me what it spelled
 RoboStac: is that the entire solution you are printing?
 MSmits: yes
 RoboStac: because it is equivalent to +&gt; 
 RoboStac: as the loop gets skipped as you are on a blank square
 JBM: magic phrase is your outout, not your code iirc
 MSmits: aww damnit
 MSmits: thanks Robo
 JBM: your code is likely valid
 MSmits: nah its valid
 JBM: it just doesn't print enough
 MSmits: just hard to see what it does because well.. brainfk
 MSmits: changed it to this: +[&gt;-[.-]-.+&lt;-]
 MSmits: Bilbo spelled: ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBAZ
 MSmits: works&#160;:)
 MSmits: well it's 1 iteration for the outer loop ofc
 MSmits: i can add more + at the start to print it many times
 dbdr: MSmits: isn't it clear what the code code when you step frame by frame?
 dbdr: it's like a debugger
 dbdr: the code *does
 MSmits: yes it does, but when it does completely nothing it's hard to say
 MSmits: it tricks you into thinking i am doing something impossible
 dbdr: the code pointer should still move
 dbdr: even if it prints nothing
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: I just didnt notice it was arriving at the [ with a space stone
 MSmits: so i figured it maybe could not understand double loops
 dbdr: don't underestimate BF&#160;;)
 MSmits: i won't&#160;:)
 dbdr: there is a WIP contribution puzzle about writing an interpreter, btw
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: interesting
 MSmits: I need my contribution quest
 MSmits: have to approve or reject something
 jacek: reject it is then
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/479414872">https://www.codingame.com/replay/479414872</a>The anti-Antisquid powermove
 MSmits: yea, go is just like othello. Corners are overpowered
 MSmits: dont use the OP corner strategy, it's unfair
 dbdr: isn't it the opposite?
 MSmits: ow right corner lost
 dbdr: anti lost because he plays a hardcoded move
 MSmits: I see
 jrke: I found BFS working for removal of all suicidal moves in atari
 dbdr: which is not valid
 MSmits: what is a suicidal move?
 jrke: Its in atari go MS
 dbdr: Atari is chill, you can get a whole league for yourself :palm_tree:
 MSmits: nice
 jrke: yeah for few hours from now
 jrke: wood 3 one person
 jrke: dbdr
 dbdr: wood 2 as well
 dbdr: wood 1 is crowded with 2 players
 jrke: yeah tric trac
 MSmits: how do you play this game anyway. Is it possible to do a alpha go zero type thing here? Seems a bit complex for a NN that fits within codesize?
 dbdr: 19x19 is big indeed
 dbdr: do we have similar board sizes in another game?
 MSmits: langtons ant
 jrke: i think i can learn minimax from atari
 MSmits: langtons ant is even bigger I think
 dbdr: and what do people do there?
 MSmits: prune 
 MSmits: a lot
 dbdr: was going to say prune for atari too
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: but you cant let the NN prune for you i sall
 dbdr: but at this point it's an open question
 MSmits: you need heuristics
 MSmits: not gonna play it any time soon I think
 jrke: yeah langton is 35*35 max
 dbdr: yeah, don't know if you could use heuristics to reduce the NN size
 MSmits: if it was kept to 7x7 max, NN would crush this
 dbdr: :D
 jrke: suppose if there is only suicidal moves are left in that case what will happen?
 MSmits: maybe the NN can be compartimentalized by looking at 4 corners of the map and combined the result somehow
 MSmits: 10x10 4 times?
 dbdr: true
 dbdr: 1 times
 dbdr: it's symmetrical
 MSmits: yes but i mean when running it
 MSmits: you need to run it 4 times
 MSmits: to obtain the score for the map
 dbdr: right. was speaking of the number of weights
 MSmits: right yes, the idea is to reduce that
 Allis: Is it know whether anyone has found a way to incorporate GPT-3 into their bots?
 MSmits: maybe if you explain what it is&#160;:)
 dbdr: in the last few hours?&#160;;)
 dbdr: well, I guess people could have worked on the contrib
 dbdr: isn't GPT focused on natural language?
 JBM: it is
 dbdr: 1. "code" your bot in english
 dbdr: 2. Use GPT3 to convert to source code
 dbdr: 3. profit?
 Allis: It's been shown to be surprisingly effective in certain scenarios.
 Allis: That overall approach to getting it to produce relevant output, I mean.
 MSmits: So I just write down that I want to have the squary things with my opponents pebbles inside them and it knows what to do?
 Bob: "code as you speak" is, just like the end of Apple, something I've seen prophecized for about as long as I've been coding
 MSmits: python does that a bit doesn't it?
 MSmits: apples have no end btw, they are round
 Bob: python does it about as much as perl does it
 Bob: python just has the pro of being actually readable&#160;:)
 Allis: Its rudimentary ability to generate programs isn't what makes it a paradigm shifter, of course.
 dbdr: I think it can only learn to generate code it has millions of example for
 dbdr: e.g. very low value code
 Bob: "prove Fermat's conjecture"
 Bob: :popcorn:
 YurkovAS: Which multy is best for beam-search? Except hypersonic.
 dbdr: which you could do more simply with the right library than in english
 MSmits: print("Fermat's conjectuire = true")
 MSmits: without the typo :P
 Bob: print("lmgtfy fermat theorem proof")
 dbdr: yeah, autocorrect can be done
 Bob: if it's really smart, that's what it will do
 dbdr: most of the time
 RoboStac: YurkovAS - code royale or spring challenge (pacman) were good for beam searches 
 YurkovAS: RoboStac thanks
 ninja252esko: bruh ur joking right
 ninja252esko:  {server} Ninja252esko takes the lead
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Hello, i'm at Bronze league in Coders strike back. And i'm struggling with circular force-field. How to set up it to win the boss?
 ninja252esko: huh?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: any help?
 ninja252esko: sure how xan i?
 ninja252esko: can*
 LeBaoHoang8A4: I'm struggling with circular force-field
 ninja252esko: oh
 ninja252esko: ok
 LeBaoHoang8A4: in coders strike back bronze
 LeBaoHoang8A4: how to set up it?
 ninja252esko: so what u have to do to beat it is u have to press alt+f4
 dbdr: Astrobytes, promoting?
 ninja252esko: what?
 ninja252esko: ohhh
 ninja252esko: ok
 Astrobytes: yeah dbdr
 dbdr: gz&#160;:)
 ninja252esko: LOL
 Astrobytes: thx&#160;:)
 dbdr: come visit me
 ninja252esko: XD
 ninja252esko: me?
 Astrobytes: ninja252esko: not particularly helpful advice
 LeBaoHoang8A4: circular force-field, how to set up it?
 dbdr: weather is perfect on wood 3 :palm_tree:
 JBM: with a magnet
 Astrobytes: LeBaoHoang8A4: how do you mean? You just output SHIELD instead of thrust or BOOST
 LeBaoHoang8A4: They said you bot need circular force-field
 dbdr: already above me at 6% :D
 ninja252esko: same brother!!
 Astrobytes: yeah, losing 100% against that boss though
 ninja252esko: b vy4  42 uj
 LeBaoHoang8A4: any help?
 ninja252esko: thats me trying to typ fast
 ninja252esko: lol
 dbdr: oh, i'm committing suicide
 LeBaoHoang8A4: what are you saying?
 Astrobytes: LeBaoHoang8A4: don't worry about the force field, it's for when you are implementing a simulation
 Astrobytes: no wait, my bad. It's just giving you the radius
 LeBaoHoang8A4: what do you mean by SHIELD?
 Astrobytes: "The pods have a circular force-field around their center, with a radius of 400 units, which activates in case of collisions with other pods."
 LeBaoHoang8A4: yep, there it is
 Astrobytes: That's just a description. It means your pods have a radius of 400 units
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about SHIELD, my fault, that comes in later leagues
 LeBaoHoang8A4: pod has a radius of 400 units?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 LeBaoHoang8A4: i can not set up, i have no idea
 Astrobytes: What do you mean by set up?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: like to make you r pod has a radius of 400 units
 el19oc: it's already set up for you
 Astrobytes: ^
 DomiKo: Guys have anybody some info about Puzzle Search Race?
 el19oc: 400 units is just the collision hitbox
 DomiKo: some people like 10 days ago sad that there are problems with 50ms
 Astrobytes: if you have a pod object you can give it a radius member variable if you want
 LeBaoHoang8A4: so it will work?
 Astrobytes: It's so you can calculate if your pod is hitting another pod or the checkpoint
 LeBaoHoang8A4: NO idea, HAHA
 Astrobytes: yeah, check the forum thread DomiKo, think Illedan said there is
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok, let me try
 dbdr: Astrobytes, your turn&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol dbdr
 Astrobytes: punishment incoming
 dbdr: :popcorn:
 dbdr: hit me hard
 Astrobytes: not yet! More of a delayed incoming :P
 DomiKo: Astrobytes i dont see his answer
 DomiKo: that's why I ask
 Astrobytes: ah damn, I forgot he answered jrke in the chat. He confirmed it
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: so sad
 Astrobytes: it's a CG thing I believe
 dbdr: lol, in the IDE I see  Rank 1 3
 dbdr: boss count on the right but not on the left
 LeBaoHoang8A4: do we need to print  circular force-field?
 dbdr: is my guess
 Astrobytes: yeah I saw that
 dbdr: actually it's new the boss does not have a rank
 Astrobytes: No LeBaoHoang8A4
 Astrobytes: Yup. Is that only in this multi? I haven't noticed before
 dbdr: I think it's just new
 dbdr: fresh bugs, delicious
 King784: Is there a way to check previous clash of code scores?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: So how my pod push anothers?
 Astrobytes: It will bump into it
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Thanks
 Astrobytes: Just make sure you aim for it
 Astrobytes: ah damn your Rust dbdr, I was wondering why I was winning all the time in the IDE and hadn't changed a line of code lol
 dbdr: do I timeout?
 Astrobytes: Nope
 dbdr: I don't do any deep search
 dbdr: you were winning before I changed my code I think
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/479430462">https://www.codingame.com/replay/479430462</a>
 dbdr: nothing to do with rust, does it?
 Astrobytes: Ah my bad
 dbdr: OK, you won that one
 Astrobytes: Wrong window (two IDEs open for whatever reason)
 dbdr: it could be the new
 dbdr: I can still suicide
 dbdr: like you&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Sometimes it's forced
 dbdr: you can pass
 Astrobytes: darn it, so you can :D
 LeBaoHoang8A4: how to access to  circular force-field? i tried
 Astrobytes: You can't access it LeBaoHoang8A4, just pretend it isn't there. It's part of your pod.
 LeBaoHoang8A4: we just declare a variable to hole its value?
 Astrobytes: Sure
 LeBaoHoang8A4: *hold
 LeBaoHoang8A4: like int v = 400:
 LeBaoHoang8A4:&#160;;
 Astrobytes: yeah
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok, i'm ready to submit. Thank for helping me!
 Astrobytes: You're welcome
 LeBaoHoang8A4: why i can not level up?
 Astrobytes: You have to be better than the boss when your submit finishes.
 LeBaoHoang8A4: i need to wait for my submission?
 Bob: yes
 Bob: when you submit your bot plays a series of games against other bots in the arena
 Bob: that determines your bot's score
 Bob: and ranking
 LeBaoHoang8A4: how many score i can pass?
 Bob: if after that you rank above the boss, then you move up
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok
 Bob: otherwise you have to improve your code and submit again
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok, thanks
 Bob: note that your score and ranking can still change once your submit is finished, as more games will be played against your bot by other players' submissions
 LeBaoHoang8A4: got it
 Bob: in some rare cases this can help you get over the boss
 LeBaoHoang8A4: it means i need to win all the players, right?
 Bob: not necessarily
 Bob: you just need to win a significant majority of your plays
 Bob: it's based on an ELO-like ranking system
 Bob: the first dozen matches let the system assign you a starting score
 Bob: after that, your score receives a bonus or malus, depending on the result of each match and the difference of scores between you and your opponent
 LeBaoHoang8A4: starting score?
 Bob: open up the leaderboard panel from the left-side menu
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok
 Bob: you will see a Score column 
 Astrobytes: Yes, so that the rest of your matches will be played against opponents of a similar level (in theory)
 Bob: it represents the "strength" of your AI
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok, because i'm ranked 7
 LeBaoHoang8A4: but can not levelup
 Bob: when you push (submit) a new version of your AI in the arena, the system plays a few games to determine an initial score
 LeBaoHoang8A4: :cry:
 Bob: after that it uses that score to match you against players of similar strength (I think it's +-20 ranks around you)
 LeBaoHoang8A4: yeah
 Bob: and your score is adjusted according to the matches's results
 Bob: you also have a Last Battles panel, where you can see and replay the matches used for your scoring
 LeBaoHoang8A4: yeah, i'm watching it
 Bob: this way you can see which matches you lose and try to understand what you can do to improve
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok
 Bob: there is a Send to IDE option to replay that particular configuration in the IDE in case you want to debug a particular situation
 benschreyer: where do i find documentation for mean max commands?
 Bob: in the statement I suppose&#160;?
 benschreyer: the goal just says gather more  water than your enemies
 Bob: if you're on the game page, click JOIN 
 Bob: and you'll have the full rules
 Astrobytes: And scroll down, past the goal
 Bob: ^
 dbdr: v
 Bob: well, do read the whole rules&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Are you getting wins against the boss now dbdr?
 dbdr: nope :D
 dbdr: I just randomized my first turn
 Astrobytes: I had a few but not enough
 dbdr: because I think you were winning the two matches we were playing constantly
 Astrobytes: yes I was
 dbdr: damn, no cgstats :D
 dbdr: Magus?
 Magus:&#160;?
 dbdr: there is a new game, Atari
 Astrobytes: It's there
 dbdr: you need to add it manually to cgstats?
 JBM: automate all the things
 Magus: cgstats update the game list every 24h
 Magus: so you'll have to wait for tomorrow :d
 Astrobytes: It's right there, above Othello
 dbdr: it just appeared
 Magus: but i see a Atari Go game
 JBM: it's magic
 dbdr: cool that it's automated
 Magus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-atari-go/dbdr">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-atari-go/dbdr</a>
 dbdr: taking inspiration from CG engineering&#160;;)
 Magus: Neumann coded this feature
 Magus: it's not mine :D
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 JBM: opensource ftw
 eulerscheZahl: and he screwed up the sorting while adding the bosses
 JBM: fix it XD
 eulerscheZahl: scrambles the order at same score
 eulerscheZahl: at least I have a github account :P
 JBM: oh i have several
 JBM: juste none associated to cg
 Maizey-Jan: i'm new here!
 JBM: great!
 Bob: hi new here
 AntiSquid: good for you
 JBM: enjoy it while it lasts
 AntiSquid: like a freshly backed potato
 Maizey-Jan: I literally don't know a single language, is this a good place to start?
 JBM: not reallt
 JBM: *ly
 AntiSquid: what do you want to do
 Maizey-Jan: python
 JBM: ugh
 AntiSquid: what do you want to do with python&#160;! @_@
 AntiSquid: you could learn python on this site imo , but eh
 Maizey-Jan: learn how to code with python. nothing super. I don't really what is the end goal with it. I just want an easy programming language in my protifolio
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codecombat.com/play">https://codecombat.com/play</a>
 AntiSquid: could do that i guess
 AntiSquid: or any python tutorial out there, tons of then
 AntiSquid: them
 Maizey-Jan: so only veterans play here?
 Bob: not necessarily veterans
 Bob: but you do need some basic understanding of at least one language
 AntiSquid: you can learn python here, but start with the link i gave you or something equally basic?
 Maizey-Jan: I just started learning python, no end goal, just something to put in my engineering protifolio
 Maizey-Jan: ok&#160;! thank you AntiSquid
 Bob: the platform is oriented towards practing existing skills
 Astrobytes: It's more of a place to build on and practice existing skills
 Bob: not really towards learning languages per se
 AntiSquid: you can go to easy puzzle section of this site if you are ok with occasionally bashing your head to the desk
 AntiSquid: (as complete beginner)
 Maizey-Jan: so codecombat is for basic or beginners?
 AntiSquid: how did you get level 3 though?
 kayou: #fajjet you almost failed to lose ...
 AntiSquid: that still requires SOME knowledge
 Bob: here you need at least to understand how your language of choice executes a program
 Bob: variables, strings, arrays/lists, loops, conditionals
 Maizey-Jan: I tried to do an easy puzzle took me 3 hours, in the end I had to look at the results , so I cheated. now I feel bad XD
 Maizey-Jan: now i'm level 3
 AntiSquid: no it's ok
 AntiSquid: it helped you access chat
 Bob: and basics of reading from the input/writing to the output
 AntiSquid: now do codecombat
 AntiSquid: or something equally simple
 Maizey-Jan: so after i'm done from code combat I can come play here?
 Bob: as soon as you feel comfortable enough with the language
 AntiSquid: you can play here now too ...
 AntiSquid: try sololearn also maybe it helps
 AntiSquid: use this as reference guide&#160;:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">https://www.w3schools.com/python/</a>
 Maizey-Jan: thank you so much 
 Bob: the catch is that this site is essentially about problem-solving
 Maizey-Jan: I wanted to learn and use what I learned to not forget, so I came here
 Bob: but beginners also need language-learning
 Maizey-Jan: understood
 Bob: and when you start it may be difficult to clearly separate issues coming from missing knowledge of the language
 AntiSquid: you can still learn as you go while doing puzzles, i don't know what works best for you, that's all
 Bob: from issues related to the actual problem at hand
 Astrobytes: And take your time, don't rush
 Bob: most puzzles can be solved in many ways, depending on how well you master a language
 Maizey-Jan: thanks Bob and Antisquid, I'll work on w3school and codecombat 
 Scarfield: also Maizey-Jan this channel on youtube is great for learning python <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms/featured">https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms/featured</a>
 Bob: but if you spend half your time asking yourself "how do I express *this* in python&#160;?" then you need to work first on baisc python practice 
 AntiSquid: Maizey-Jan don't forget <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sololearn.com/">https://www.sololearn.com/</a>
 Maizey-Jan: thank you so much, I'll start working on it today
 AntiSquid: Scarfield first vid on the youtube channel&#160;: JS on codepen.io :P
 AntiSquid: oh nvm he uses python in there :o
 AntiSquid: python for web! infidel
 Maizey-Jan: Do I need to know more than 1 coding language? I just want to learn 1. but some tell me you need more
 JBM: one at a time is plenty for a start
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about that for now, focus on one thing at a time and build on it later
 Scarfield: weird anyway, i dont see that video, only python ones, they must be featured according to your history then
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong about python for web development?
 eulerscheZahl: django and flask are both popular
 Astrobytes: flask is great
 JBM: popularity isn't an argument for righteousness
 itzblinkzy: web development = javascript
 itzblinkzy: ur weird if u use python for that kind of stuff
 JBM: (or anything)
 eulerscheZahl: fair point JBMbut i quite like Django
 JBM: you're entitled to
 Scarfield: thats is a popular oppinion yes, JBM :p
 Bob: whatever does the job the way you want id OK
 Bob: is*
 Astrobytes: ^
 JBM: as long as you don't pester us about it
 Scarfield: "my way is the only way!" 
 JBM: it may be
 JBM: for you
 Astrobytes: Dictatorfield
 Scarfield: xD
 Alshock: Hey look, I have another way to prove that your way is the only way possible!
 Scarfield: NicknamestroBytes
 JBM: Maestrobytes
 Astrobytes: I like that
 JBM: free for use
 NikkoCoder: hoi
 Schwase: astro when did you get mod?
 Schwase: congrats btw
 Astrobytes: thanks Schwase, earlier this week. Quite a few of us got mod status on here, the forum and discord
 Astrobytes: Was a lot of spam/nonsense recently, so more of us around means less issues
 eulerscheZahl: and one of them just disappeared&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I've not seen WINWINWIN for a while either
 eulerscheZahl: true
 Astrobytes: Hope they're both alright tbh
 Scarfield: yea&#160;:/
 Scarfield: but i think WINWINWIN was on recently though
 Astrobytes: ah OK, normally I see him around but didn't for a while
 AntiSquid: Winwinwin was doing some kaggle (added me there) not sure if he still active
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/tejasshyam">https://www.kaggle.com/tejasshyam</a>
 AntiSquid: oh he is active, 2 submissions today
 Astrobytes: cool
 Vistaf: defo python with shortest mode
 pardouin: cannot agree more&#160;:)
 jacek: i read atari go has some bugs?
 Astrobytes: No
 Astrobytes: But it isn't instantly clear which colour you are, which is what led to the suspicion of a bug
 eulerscheZahl: hm: yellow/blue vs black/whitenot optimal
 eulerscheZahl: confused me a lot at checkers
 eulerscheZahl: especially before avatars were added to the replays
 jacek: well and stone below avatar is misleading until you read its about the captured ones
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the color below your avatar is *not* your own color?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: yeah
 el19oc: what exactly causes the did not read all inputs, code may be out of sync with the game warning?
 JBM: not reading the input
 el19oc: interesting
 Scarfield: have gone up a league in a multi? then the inputs can change
 el19oc: sometimes it just seems to pop up after I change some irrelevant function, even if the function isn't ran.
 el19oc: I don't think the inputs changed but I could check, thanks
 RoboStac: technically it's if you print more output than expected before they give you input (eg printing two lots of moves for one turns input)
 JBM: hard to distinguish
 el19oc: aah can't figure it out, I think you're right that it might be to do with printing too many moves at once
 Astrobytes: Are you printing anything to stderr?
 el19oc: can't tell how it's happening though, I'll come back to it later
 el19oc: yeah a lot
 Astrobytes: That's probably it, that happens to me
 el19oc: wait really
 Astrobytes: Try disabling it and see if it goes away
 jacek: no wai
 Scarfield: you can timeout from excessive errorprinting, but do you get the "did not read all..." error from that?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, sometimes
 Scarfield: TIL
 Astrobytes: It's a feature I really wish I could turn off
 jacek: write better programs then
 Scarfield: wouldnt having an error string, adding to that, and only printing the whole thing once help?
 Astrobytes: burn jacek! :fire:
 el19oc: ohohohoho
 JBM: especially in code golf
 el19oc: I think that was actually it
 Astrobytes: I reported that printing to stderr triggered it sometimes on the day they introduced it
 Scarfield: hmm i feel neinCek should be banned, you have the powers le 'stro
 Scarfield: joke btw..
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: took me a second :D
 Astrobytes: neinCek was pretty good
 Scarfield: ty, thats very humbling :p
 Scarfield: if humbling is actually a word
 JBM: you can word a lot of terms in english
 Astrobytes: It is. The question is: just how humbling is it?
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: its incomprehensible
 JBM: but is it comprehensive?
 Astrobytes: Comprehensively incomprehensible.
 JBM: yet apprehendable without apprehension
 Scarfield: its only apprehendable without apprehension? I smell a paradox
 JBM: not exclusively
 Scarfield: phew, was afraid you were about to fry the automatons
 JBM: i wish
 Scarfield: xD
 JBM: the NN one is rather useless
 jacek: AutomatonNN or Automaton2000 is NN?
 Automaton2000: then it would be possible to make the next contest?
 Scarfield: they have some rare gems, calling euler a noob for instance
 AutomatonNN: was it me a bit more complicated to do in the contest?
 JBM: take a guess
 jacek: ahh those are Janus' bots
 JBM: it's neinnus now
 Astrobytes: Automat***NN is in fact representatively reprehensible
 Scarfield: in danish j as first letter is silent
 JBM: repressively so, dare i add
 Scarfield: well not really i relunctantly admit
 JBM: how remissive
 McCheng: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1316662a138fcdf2eb90c4b66032b8b78c7af69">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1316662a138fcdf2eb90c4b66032b8b78c7af69</a>
 Astrobytes: Of course
 McCheng: That is too insane
 jacek: clash addicts
 Reaperz: has anyone solved "The Lucky Number" i cant seem to pass test 5 and 6
 Reaperz: really dont know how else to optimise my code
 69razer69: i will try it
 69razer69: so we consider it a lucky only if it contains an 8 or 6 neither the both
 Reaperz: yeh
 69razer69: you went for a bruth force
 Reaperz: yeh i used a forlopp from L to R with an 1 if statement
 69razer69: insane amount of numbers 1 -- 10^18
 Reaperz: just not sure how else to do it
 69razer69: well i was thinking what if incrementing by 2
 69razer69: maybe using mod&#160;%
 Reaperz: how would you use the&#160;%
 69razer69: so take the L&#160;% 10 and find the nearest lucky number
 69razer69: L = 53 
 69razer69: L&#160;% 10 = 3if( L&#160;% 3 &lt; 6)&#160;: L = L + 6&#160;% 3
 chickenJS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/904da33e-75e4-4b09-96b2-4023870b52a2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/904da33e-75e4-4b09-96b2-4023870b52a2</a>
 69razer69: then alternatively increment by 8 and 2
 chickenJS: pls give me a answer
 Reaperz: so the first loop will ad 8 then 2nd would add 2 and so on?
 69razer69: 1st cicle add 8 
 69razer69: second add 2
 69razer69: 56 + 2 = 58 Lucky58 + 8 = 66 Lucky
 Scarfield: that will only find numbers ending with the digit 6 or 8, what about 600
 69razer69: and look up for the special cases like (10*6)  (100*6) so on 
 Reaperz: hmm il see if i can do tht thx
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: chickenjs if we just give an answer you won't learn anything
 Reaperz: been at this since 4 hrs brain is a bit muddled up xD
 Scarfield: Reaperz i havent done this puzzle, but im pretty sure you will need something much much faster.
 Reaperz: yeh i think so too&#160;;/
 Scarfield: range from 1000 - 20001xyz how many digits for x, y and z will be lucky
 Scarfield: something like this is what i suppose the puzzle is about
 Reaperz: oh i see just clocked thts the number it increases by for every 1k remains the same
 Scarfield: that wasnt what i was getting at, but sure - with some exceptions (6k, 8k, 16k, .. , etc)
 eulerscheZahl: and range L to R is 1..R - 1..(L-1)
 Reaperz: so complicated xD sry seems like i am really slow haha
 eulerscheZahl: it's not a trivial problem
 eulerscheZahl: do you try to solve it for a job application?
 Reaperz: practising for one 
 eulerscheZahl: at mthree?
 Reaperz: yeh i applied it for it yesterday. Still havent heard from it yet but found a few questions some were asked so was practicing them  
 JBM: eZ: how did you know?
 JBM: are they already famous for using that question?! o_O
 eulerscheZahl: someone struggled with the same problem (lucky numbers) on discord recently
 Reaperz: oh damn here i was hoping it wasnt tht popular..
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61166d34-68d1-4d2e-bd18-6bf11fc57bc7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61166d34-68d1-4d2e-bd18-6bf11fc57bc7</a>
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 JBM: oh
 JBM: like they scraped it and use without attribution
 eulerscheZahl: they use CG as an official contractor
 JBM: ah, better
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they just liked the problem. I didn't really enjoy it
 eulerscheZahl: the concept was instantly clear to me. but a few cases to consider
 eulerscheZahl: so my solution turned into about 70 lines
 eulerscheZahl: looking at other solutions, it's even on the short side
 Hankdane: It seems like the kind of problem where if you know the right number theory background, it's easy (or at least doable), otherwise you're screwed.
 eulerscheZahl: true. i've seen similar tasks on project euler before
 Hankdane: It's pretty clear they are not looking for the brute force method.
 Scarfield: just looked at the puzzle, that would be some rather brute, brute force
 Scarfield: 1≤L≤R≤10^18
 Reaperz: wow 70 lines
 Reaperz: least urs worked id assume xD
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i remember a problem on project euler where they asked about the last 5 non-zero digits of 10^12! (factorial)I got the idea but failed to implement it
 eulerscheZahl: 10^12 takes about 1 day to finish
 Scarfield: it is estimated that the there are between 10^78 to 10^82 atoms in the known, observable universe
 Scarfield: 10^12! is just ridiculous :O
 Reaperz: crazy  numbers for both
 SPDene: lol. reminds me of some real-life code that had to be run at the end of (every) month. the code wasn't very efficient; we predicted it would take 40 days to run, each month!
 Reaperz: wow
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 Scarfield: lol
 chickenJS: too hard
 Scarfield: wait.. 10^12! only has one non-zero digit, i feel like somethings missing in that problem :p
 Thyl: Good evening&#160;!
 Reaperz: ngl i feel it has many missing parts but thts cuz i am not as good xD
 Reaperz: good evening&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: "wait.. 10^12! only has one non-zero digit,"you see me confused
 Scarfield: a 1 with 12! zeros has one non-zero digit? now im confused xD
 eulerscheZahl: (10^12)!
 Scarfield: oooh
 Astrobytes: hahaha ffs Slowfield!
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm not sure about the operator priority anymore
 Scarfield: im not sure how i didnt realise i just read it wrong :D
 eulerscheZahl: if I can trust pari/gp, i messed it up and the misunderstanding is totally my fault
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;? 2^3!%1 = 64? (2^3)!%2 = 40320
 Pjdux: .......

 eulerscheZahl: you lost against 2 bots
 AntiSquid: you lost because you used PHP while having JS in your name, the universe punished you
 Astrobytes: chickenPHP...
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chickenjs">https://www.npmjs.com/package/chickenjs</a> this exists
 Astrobytes: Chicken pho exists, only one letter away :P
 Bob: AntiSquid: virtually anything exists in JS
 Bob: JS is practically the rule 34 of languages
 AntiSquid: lol
 Astrobytes: lol
 Bob: and as for the actual rule 34, anything that exists because of it doesn't even have to make sense
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rule34">https://www.npmjs.com/package/rule34</a>
 AntiSquid: "Rule 34 of programming:If it exists, it's on npm."
 Astrobytes: hah
 Bob: that's so meta
 Bob: and it doesn't make (much) sense
 Bob: QED
 Astrobytes: gg
 eulerscheZahl: but do you know chickentuna?
 Astrobytes: the phantom github contributor
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's jupoulton but i'm not sure
 Astrobytes: I've tried to guess too but not sure
 AntiSquid: quite sure it is jup, based on some convo on slack
 AntiSquid: or a shared account&#160;??
 Astrobytes: that's one of my thoughts on it, usually quite active around competition times so would figure
 Astrobytes: Suppose we could just ask
 eulerscheZahl: but first they shall accept my PR
 eulerscheZahl: oh, mystery solved
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tre37y">https://prnt.sc/tre37y</a>
 eulerscheZahl: list of online friends on discord
 Astrobytes: aha
 eulerscheZahl: using an alias for CG i guess
 Astrobytes: ffs, all I had to do was click on his discord profile, d'oh
 eulerscheZahl: like Thibaud = TwoStepsconfused me too at first
 Astrobytes: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't aware of alias names and thought I messaged the wrong user
 Astrobytes: what was your PR? The replay thing?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: reduced replay size for the toggle module
 eulerscheZahl: then i decided to drop that part and call the module from JS without the SDK :D
 eulerscheZahl: so I have my own modules now. the TinyToggleModule and the FooltipModule
 Astrobytes: Nice. How's it coming along?
 eulerscheZahl: the game is playable I think
 Astrobytes: "Fooltip" hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: you get nuts when you have to deal with JS for a while
 Astrobytes: hehehe, 5 minutes is usually enough
 eulerscheZahl: you realize that you are getting crazy when you start laughing about your own puns while coding
 <b>**Astrobytes does that most of the time anyway </b></p><p><img src="/a/44990769450746" /> AntiSquid: good way to keep it fun and not lose interest

 AntiSquid: that's a really nice rick roll
 Astrobytes: My friend rickrolled us at his wedding, halfway through his speech. Complete with soundtrack.
 AntiSquid: was everyone wearing a kilt?
 Astrobytes: Considering he's Swedish and we were in Sweden, no.
 Astrobytes: He's divorced now, but the wedding was great
 JBM: ooooooh a semi-easy PE
 Astrobytes: I love that "RichardIsAFuckingIdiot" post on SO 
 788361: a friend of mine used an entire monologue of a french comedy movie as his graduation speech
 JBM: sounds nice 788361
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Bob: I'm not sure any of the teaching staff noticed
 Bob: nearly two minutes long
 Bob: and word-perfect
 Astrobytes: Well played that man
 Bob: someone did a video with his speech and the original movie sequence side by side
 Bob: even the timing and voicing is near perfect
 Bob: pure genius
 dbdr: which comedy?
 Bob: incidentally the guy's pretty good at coding too
 Scarfield: is he named Richard?
 Bob: nope
 Bob: he's the main developer of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.solarus-games.org/">https://www.solarus-games.org/</a>
 Bob: dbdr: Mission Cleopatre
 JBM: baer? XD
 Astrobytes: They did live action Astérix movies? TIL
 dbdr: "Vegan on a Desert Island" :D
 Bob: JBM, yes
 JBM: forcementally
 JBM: i should learn that one
 Bob: that monologue is actually perfect as a speech for virtually any occasion
 JBM: sounds great, light-spirited, vacuous message
 JBM: no feelings offended
 dbdr: there are graduaction speeches in France??
 JBM: i heard some schools started americanizing theirs
 Astrobytes: ugh
 JBM: with gowns and square hats and stuff
 dbdr: wtf
 Astrobytes: They do that in the UK too, always have
 JBM: my feeling too
 Bob: some engineering schools have that, yes
 Bob: speeches at least
 Astrobytes: I'm more concerned about the introduction of US-style "proms" in highschool
 AntiSquid: all good they didn't copy the tuition fees and student debt from US did they?
 Bob: not yet
 AntiSquid: western nations being more civilized
 Astrobytes: heh
 Bob: :beer: time
 Alshock: nothing's farthest west than the US on our worldmap
 Alshock: farther?
 dbdr: Japan is to the west of the USA&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: lies, the world is flat
 Alshock: nope, on our european map it's far-east
 dbdr: really?
 JBM: you have japan on a european map?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Alshock: because you believe the world actually exists AntiSquid?
 JBM: in gmaps, there are 3 japans if you zoom out far enough
 AntiSquid: because we need anime, of course we have japan in europe
 Alshock: @JBM european world map
 AntiSquid: japan should be invited to join the EU
 Astrobytes: So you can have WeeabEUs?!
 Bob: if they give us their train system, I'm in favor
 JBM: so we can make the US feel uneasy
 Astrobytes: Currently they can do that by themselves
 JBM: they were always at war with eastasia
 Bob: JBM &lt;3
 JBM: ok gotta listen to baer again
 Alshock: Well australia is part of our song contest. I strongly suspect that some organizer just mistook them for austria at one point and they never acknoledged their mistake
 Alshock: +w
 Bob: maybe they could tour the sumo bashos in EU too
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they've found it a much harder area to destabilise however
 Bob: I'd love to see one someday
 Bob: other than on youtube, I mean
 Astrobytes: Are they still having issues with recruiting sumo students?
 Bob: no idea
 Bob: they did&#160;?
 Bob: there's still a fairly large amount (no pun intended) of candidates in the lower leagues
 Astrobytes: Yeah, as well as being considered "old-fashioned" and not relevant the trainees were just not able to take it
 Astrobytes: Oh I meant sumo overall
 Bob: oh
 Bob: I think it's a recurring issue with most traditional disciplines
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you can try to modernise to an extent but... sooner or later you lose the essence I suppose
 Bob: admittedly sumo in particular is a particularly hash school of life
 JBM: aaaah that was good
 Bob: even when they make it to the top
 Bob: one of the top division wrestlers was retired from the current tournament by his master because he violated the covid caution directives
 Bob: the press has it he's even likely to be actually fired
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they're hardcore on the discipline
 dbdr: "I am only love"
 dbdr: he said that in his speech?&#160;:)
 Bob: the entire speech
 Bob: word for word
 Bob: one of the best trolls ever
 Bob: japan has a seeminlgy neverending supply of traditional disciplines kept on life support by a handful of devoted people
 Bob: swimming in samurai armor is a particularly nice one
 Astrobytes: Hah!
 Bob: firing 18th ccentury mortars, too
 Astrobytes: We're getting back to a Rule 32 situation there Bob
 Astrobytes: or *34
 AntiSquid: what's the point of graduation speeches in general?

 Bob: party afterwards&#160;?
 Bob: :beer:
 AntiSquid: the piece of paper? idk
 JBM: they could mail it
 Bob: huh I need to refill the fridge
 Bob: some local breweries here made a batch they called "the pangolin's revenge"
 Astrobytes: mwahaha
 Bob: tastes of caramel and liquorice
 dbdr: I'd try that!
 Astrobytes: Ever had a German rauchbier? 
 Bob: doesn't ring a bell
 Bob: I suppose I'd remember
 Astrobytes: It's like drinking smoked meat, cheese and beer at the same time.
 Astrobytes: In a good way
 Astrobytes: But I'd challenge you to have more than a smal lglass
 Astrobytes: *small
 Astrobytes: Smoked barley they use I believe
 Astrobytes: (malt barley)

 Astrobytes: (wrt the Pangolin)
 AntiSquid: sometimes i wish i paid attention in French class
 Bob: my, whatever for?
 AntiSquid: to understand the language lol
 Bob: half of it makes no sense
 Astrobytes: HAve you tried Le Mulet Bob?
 AntiSquid: i can understand the other half i think
 Bob: half of the alphabet isn't even pronunced the way you'd expect
 Bob: Astrobytes: nope
 JBM: fix ur expactation
 AntiSquid: i am aware 
 AntiSquid: that's why i hated french in school
 Astrobytes: It sounds nice, I'm a fan of triples
 Bob: Astrobytes: I haven't tried anything from that particuilar brewery
 Bob: my pangolin one is made by one of the other 4 who participated
 Astrobytes: I see
 Bob: AntiSquid: you're welcome to still hate it :p
 Bob: my kids marvel at the sheer stupidity of the many inconsistencies they have to learn
 JBM: that'll prepare them for legacy code
 Bob: hah
 Astrobytes: lol
 Bob: definitely
 JBM: "why are we still maintaining react apps"
 Bob: the worst thing about "legacy" code is that stuff as little as two months old can qualify as such
 JBM: "what do you mean we still can't vertically center an html element in its container"
 Bob: height: 100%
 JBM: "we've had 50 years to phase JS out and it's still there?"
 Astrobytes: This is why I never went back to web dev after 2001 and went for biology instead.
 Astrobytes: Well, OK, I dabbled. But I didn't inhale.
 Bob: a few weeks ago my r&amp;d lead suggested to me to use html tables to make a layout
 JBM: "it still works"
 Astrobytes: hah!
 Bob: he stopped short of suggesting bits of pictures to put in the corner cells to display rounded corners
 SPDene: tell him you decided to use ascii tables instead ヽ(ຈل͜ຈ)ﾉ︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: shims and corner pieces, jeez
 Bob: maybe he'll try pushing animated gifs of 3D-rendered logos
 Bob: geocities, here we coe
 Astrobytes: MIDI files on page load
 Bob: come*
 Bob: ooooo midi files &lt;3
 JBM: leeched off ftp sites who knows where
 JBM: traded with friends in dark alleys
 Bob: gopher ftw
 JBM: i never found midis on gopher
 Astrobytes: Only dark alleys
 Bob: certainly no friends either
 JBM: hey, they were so illegal
 JBM: the bigcos were certainly already after us

 Bob: gosh
 Bob: people with so much idle time on their hands
 dbdr: try q and e
 Bob: mind: blown
 Astrobytes: haha nice rotation
 dbdr: well, that could be said about any game
 JBM: ok i've got the sword, now where do i go?
 Bob: there's reflection in the water, nice
 Bob: try and find ganondorf
 Bob: then kill him
 JBM: seems too dangerous out there
 JBM: which one are you?
 Bob: the other one
 dbdr: I'm jumping
 JBM: so am i
 JBM: didn't make me find tou
 JBM: *u
 Astrobytes: and me
 dbdr: where do I get a sword?
 JBM: in the dark alley :p
 JBM: ok i'm on the small island
 dbdr: seems there's a limit how far you can swimm
 JBM: at the end of the road
 JBM: umping every now and then
 MSmits: errr what is the point
 Bob: there is a variant which appears to feature sword and shields
 Bob: I can't figure out how to pick them up though
 Bob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://asciicker.com/y6/">https://asciicker.com/y6/</a>
 dbdr: reached the end of the world, big cliff
 dbdr: the world is flat1
 JBM: don't jump
 dbdr: can't I think
 Astrobytes: yeah can't go past some boundary
 JBM: got a green potion
 dbdr: got a hammer
 Bob: does it say "drink me" on the label?
 JBM: and a battle-axe ^^
 MSmits: well i must say this is more fun than typing in a solution for the last validator of cotr
 dbdr: Giant's Hammer
 Bob: Your blessed +5 Mjollnir hits the master lich!
 Astrobytes: well, anyway, I'm out, gn/bn all
 Bob: same here
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 dbdr: oh there's a keyboard
 MSmits: and Bob
 JBM: got armor of some sort
 JBM: oh, i brings up inventory
 JBM: "Giant's Axe", actually
 JBM: the nethack keybindings don't appear to wokr here
 AntiSquid: wtf is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://asciicker.com/y6/">https://asciicker.com/y6/</a>&#160;?
 AntiSquid: got any links to ascii VR games too?
 JBM: how do i wear my armor
 dbdr: found wine :D
 JBM: you can kind of lie down with "End"
 JBM: (get up with Home)
 JBM: got bread and cheese
 JBM: carrot and beet
 dbdr: oh, tab to write
 JBM: and cucumber
 JBM: cherry and plum
 dbdr: Plus Sword
 MSmits: i tried to kill you dbdr
 MSmits: didnt work
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: not sure what the percentages are
 dbdr: how do you use a weapon?
 JBM: now what
 dbdr: I have several in inventory
 dbdr: bow, sword, ...
 JBM: it froze
 MSmits: rightclick
 MSmits: dbdr
 MSmits: and use with enter
 MSmits: I am using some mad fighting skills on you, but maybe this is not a pvp server
 dbdr: hm, I can use the sword but not the bow or the mace
 dbdr: would be nice to get in the boat
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: cant get in the boat either
 JBM: by jumping from rock to rock?
 Insufficient: that feels really intuitive to be able to move by dragging with the mouse cursor 
 Insufficient: most games you have to use mouse for something else so its not as easy an option for default controls 
 MSmits: well I was on the boat
 MSmits: then fell off the other side cuz i jumped too fast
 dbdr: :D
 Insufficient: and its super cool how when you walk up cliffs its fine but when you move back down the cliff it makes you jump, like its almost 1 way gravity
 MSmits: I;m on it!
 MSmits: dont think it works
 dbdr: let's go!
 JBM: there's a success pic of it on the subreddit
 MSmits: of being on the boat?
 MSmits: or of it moving?
 JBM: being on it
 MSmits: who;s with me on the boat
 dbdr: I am
 MSmits: so someone was proud enough getting on it, that they posted a pic
 JBM: something like that
 MSmits: it;s just a couple rocks :P
 dbdr: was hard for me :D
 dbdr: trying to give you some wine
 dbdr: I can drag items, says drop, but then it does not
 MSmits: hmm ok
 dbdr: drowing :D
 MSmits: this where 20 years of gaming experience really pays off
 MSmits: I'm out, gonna watch some netflix, you may have the boat mow
 MSmits: now
 Pjdux: The program:A ticket has a 6 digit number that goes from 000000 to 999999. It is a lucky ticket if the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three digits.
 Pjdux: but then 111222 is true?? im so frustrated
 MSmits: that's a clash
 Pjdux: yes lol I'm new here 
 MSmits: that's false
 MSmits: 1+1+1&#160;!= 2+2+2
 MSmits: I actually did that clash before
 Pjdux: on the example outputs thats what i see
 MSmits: if it is 123204  it is lucky
 Pjdux: unless thats also a test lol
 Pjdux: a is also true
 Pjdux: 4 sorry
 MSmits: whats the exact input of the example?
 Pjdux: a single int
 Pjdux: INPUT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0625dfb8-92a4-47e4-b733-05aa3e84407f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0625dfb8-92a4-47e4-b733-05aa3e84407f</a>
 MSmits: first is lucky
 Pjdux: sorry i tried pasting the info
 MSmits: true false, true
 MSmits: false
 MSmits: yeah its correct
 dbdr: hm, naked man
 Pjdux: oh so the 4 is just how many arrays i have to deal with&#160;?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: you loop over this
 MSmits: it's the loop-max for input
 Pjdux: i have an idea on how to solve it 
 Pjdux: its just that threw me off 
 MSmits: for your language, just index the input string, convert to int and add them up for 1,2,3 and for 4,5,6
 MSmits: they're all length 6
 MSmits: i mean for 0,1,2 and 3,4,5 obviously
 Pjdux: if half1.reduce((x,i) =&gt; x + i) === half2..reduce((x,i) =&gt; x + i)  return true
 Pjdux: lol something within those
 MSmits: no idea what that is
 MSmits: but it looks like javascript
 MSmits: because of the ===
 MSmits: way too many =
 Pjdux: it is lol
 MSmits: ok I'm out for real now, gn&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you put 2 dots after half2
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/5xGoELE">https://imgur.com/a/5xGoELE</a>
 dbdr: nice collection
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grMIbHPK21M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grMIbHPK21M</a> story behind the game is quite interesting
 Pjdux: hey guys is there anyway that i can sort of filter the easy games  
 Pjdux: NVM lol
 DomiKo: you can't say that game X is easier than game Y
 DomiKo: that's your preference
 DomiKo: yours*
 Andriamanitra: at least for clashes there is difficulty rating in the "how was this clash?" after each round, it should be trivial to filter them by average difficulty rating
 itzblinkzy: :D
 itzblinkzy: Thanks for sharing your code Unicorn I understood where I went wrong.
 Allison: That moment when you're super excited about figuring something out, then are afraid to look at what other people did so that you don't have to feel dumb... xD
 GiulioFischietti: i started playing this game thinking it was wasy... it was not.
 GiulioFischietti: xD

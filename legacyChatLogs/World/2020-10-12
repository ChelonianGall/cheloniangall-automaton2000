 Sunkin351: :thinking:
 thepapisogram: hi
 DaNinja: because the words are the same I guess
 Sunkin351: Like, why though? How am I supposed to handle that?
 Q12: " If a word shares all its prefixes with the other different words, then, to avoid starvation, its prefix will be itself, and all its prefixes cannot be used by other words"
 MegaMayka: hello
 Hoangbonduy_VN: hello
 CopperFr: hello
 _ATK_: hey
 huss3: sup
 wlesavo: westicles nice, how close you are to char limit? 
 Westicles: I gave up on hardcoding, just switched to the snake 
 wlesavo: oh i see
 Westicles: I was maxed out around 17 million hardcoded
 wlesavo: didnt noticed you changed language
 wlesavo: Westicles i think with ideal solution in hardcoding you have to focus on a single test, and on others just gave up a single leetter or smth like "ULR"
 Westicles: Yeah, that's I was doing
 wlesavo: oh i see. how far you were able to go on a single test?
 Westicles: Well, I never had scores over around 800k each with the old approach, so they almost all fit
 Westicles: I think we are doing the same thing... 6 deep with 3 directions?
 wlesavo: Westicles im at 7 deep
 Koopa_176: Someone here uses Atom?
 wlesavo: 3 directions, yeah
 Koopa_176:&#160;;-;
 The_Auditor: hello
 Shadowtick: hi
 geppoz: wlesavo what do you mean with "char limit problem"?
 The_Auditor: couldn't find which multi was chosen for the winter throne event
 wlesavo: geppoz well if you going for hardcode there is only 100k chars for 30 tests around 30-50k moves  each
 MSmits: geppoz you are only allowed to submit source code with up to 200kb worth of characters
 MSmits: it's a bit complicated with some characters using more bytes than others I guess
 geppoz: lol are you hardcoding? submission tests are same of IDE ones?
 MSmits: geppoz we have many optim arena's you can hardcode. Still means you need a good search though
 MSmits: a better search is often worth a million times more calculation time
 wlesavo: westicles did, but ended up doing online solution
 The_Auditor: if you train a NN and put the weights into an array, that is hard coding, right&#160;?
 MSmits: it kind of is
 geppoz: no it is not
 The_Auditor: LOL
 MSmits: I disagree
 sofiaaa: no
 geppoz: if you run it vs different test
 sofiaaa: ur supposed to start them off with random weights
 Q12: The_Auditor A CODE OF ICE AND FIRE this is the winter competition
 The_Auditor: the flame war is atarted, my work here is done
 geppoz: :D
 MSmits: when you train a NN, you have no idea how the information is actually structured
 sofiaaa: what
 sofiaaa: i could literally print every weight of every neuron
 geppoz: my only question is "why?"
 geppoz: why put submission same of tests?
 geppoz: that changes all the real purpose of the programming
 MSmits: because it is pretty hard to avoid them leaking
 MSmits: i dont think it changes things all that much
 MSmits: the search you need to get a high score, will still be very similar
 MSmits: also, you dont need to share your code CG, if you don't want to
 MSmits: not that most people care about that
 MSmits: try number shifting. This is an optim explicitly written to be hardcoded
 MSmits: you'll see how little it matters that you have infinite calculation time
 dbdr: euler is creating every possible type of optim&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: yeah he really went nuts on the optims
 MSmits: which is good i guess, the number of multi arenas  compared to optims was lopsided
 wlesavo: NS is still probably my favorite game on cg
 MSmits: I liked it too, not my favorite but pretty high 
 The_Auditor: NS&#160;?
 dbdr: Netscaoe
 wlesavo: number shifting
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/number-shifting">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/number-shifting</a>
 dbdr: NS is the only euler optim where I'm not #1 :D
 MSmits: get crackin
 MSmits: the weather's getting colder
 dbdr: he spend more energy creating them than solving them
 MSmits: perfect time for some cpu heat
 dbdr: yes, I was  thinking that, heating soon needed again :D
 MSmits: in 10 years half of my country's energy consumption will be data centers
 wlesavo: wow new multi from trictrac, looks really nice
 dbdr: is that a precise prediction?
 MSmits: yeah
 The_Auditor: i create all my CPU + GPU heat on Folding@home
 MSmits: it's nuts
 MSmits: google and microsoft are placing huge data centers in my country
 dbdr: iceland is great for datacenters because they have cheap geothermal energy
 MSmits: we have wind
 dbdr: and probably cooling is easier too :D
 MSmits: they are placing them next to wind parks
 dbdr: wind is nice, but you need to invest a lot, lots of space and at some point replace them
 The_Auditor: currently Folding@home works on covi19 proteins
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: and they whack birds
 MSmits: this will drive bird evolution
 dbdr: less than cats
 dbdr: that's a fake argument I think
 MSmits: might be
 MSmits: link to trictrac's game
 MSmits: nvm got it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5550bf0ccd57b94252c64606b76c5fbd253e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5550bf0ccd57b94252c64606b76c5fbd253e</a>
 dbdr: what game?
 MSmits: Blocking
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/15195/wind-turbines-are-not-killing-fields-for-birds/">https://www.statista.com/chart/15195/wind-turbines-are-not-killing-fields-for-birds/</a>
 wlesavo: pvp tetris :slight_smile:
 dbdr: cats kill 2.4 billion birds :O
 MSmits: the cat I had when I was young was too fat to catch birds
 MSmits: but it ate the neighbor cat's birds
 dbdr: that's the problem when politicians use talking point without orders of magnitude. might be true and totally insignificant at the same time
 MSmits: yeah if they just said the 200.000, it would seem like a lot
 dbdr: exactly
 dbdr: poor birdies
 MSmits: I might use this piece of information
 MSmits: i have an assignment
 MSmits: on fake news and misleading statistics
 MSmits: seems perfect
 dbdr: indeed
 wlesavo: poor cats have to eat 2.4b birds!
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: not all birds taste like chicken
 MSmits: I assume
 dbdr: poor birds have to eat worms
 MSmits: maybe some worms taste like chicken
 dbdr: I know frogs do&#160;:)
 MSmits: how do you know?
 dbdr: I ate frogs one or twice, as a kid
 MSmits: ahh ok, I assumed corona just got really bad in your country
 dbdr: you mean food shortage?
 MSmits: yea
 wlesavo: you was a French kid that grow up Hungarian? :slight_smile:
 dbdr: I grew up French
 MSmits: I didn't know the French ate frogs
 MSmits: I knew about the snails
 wlesavo: i wonder why didnt we ever tried to cook a frog as a kids
 dbdr: it's quite rare, but it exists
 Astrobytes: Italians do in some parts as well. Used to be able to get them from the fish and chip shop here (italian run). They're alright.
 wlesavo: MSmits it is a popular stereotype, i dont know to what extent it is true though
 dbdr: it is known, the english sometimes call the french "the frogs" as an insult because of it
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: interesting
 Astrobytes: and rosbifs in return
 MSmits: I'm starting to understand why Euler has this avatar
 dbdr: as I said, I ate frogs and snails once or twice each, and I think that's typical
 dbdr: not everyday food
 wlesavo: dbdr yeah in russian there is an analogue to that
 Astrobytes: Snails need a *lot* of garlic &amp; butter
 Astrobytes: They're not palatable without imo
 dbdr: yeah
 MSmits: they are easy to catch too
 Astrobytes: I tried a tinned snail once... oh dear
 dbdr: only after a rain&#160;:)
 MSmits: it was really good Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: I'd rather eat raw frogs
 MSmits: even better?
 MSmits: how about worms
 Astrobytes: Put it this way, it is a crime that tinned snails exist
 MSmits: ahh I see
 MSmits: the best things are illegal
 Astrobytes: ffs :P
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 dbdr: says the Dutch guy
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: barely Dutch :P
 MSmits: fitting parameters for checkers atm
 MSmits: cant believe I still havent figured out a good way to fit offline
 Astrobytes: You got your negamax working then?
 MSmits: it worked
 MSmits: then I tried the eval in my mcts bot
 MSmits: and it was better
 dbdr: what are you rather? EU citizen? world citizen?
 Astrobytes: ah, EPT I guess?
 MSmits: nah I am just saying I have less in common with the average dutch guy than with you guys
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 MSmits: EPT yes depth 0, so just eval... UCT guided search
 Astrobytes: cool
 MSmits: I an ranked 6-7 before fitting params properly, Just now fitting exploration and winrate going from 31.5 to 40% against rank 2-6
 MSmits: of course I can't fit against rank 1
 MSmits: unless dbdr did his compiled version submit thingy
 dbdr: I think I might
 dbdr: try it
 MSmits: ahh ok, might try later, thanks
 MSmits: it's not that critical. I just want a range of different players
 MSmits: you always risk someone being deterministic and throwing off your fit
 MSmits: there's some weird features people put in their checkers eval I found
 MSmits: I don't understand half of it
 MSmits: sometimes it almost looks like ntuple
 dbdr: the man who could guess the opponent's eval functions&#160;:)
 anantaCodes: Can I share my Codingame profile on my resume?
 MSmits: Sure, but maybe you need to explain why
 MSmits: also you might want to beef it up a bit first
 MSmits: get some cp, xp, some competitive rankings in a multi or two, maybe participate in a few contests etc.
 Astrobytes: pictures of steaks, burgers etc
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: sorry, too good to resist
 MSmits: I know, it was the first thing I thought after i typed it
 wlesavo: im so hungry i would eat a frog now
 MSmits: it was, damn... i can't make puns on my own messages
 MSmits: wlesavo Euler may log in later
 Astrobytes: Toad&#160;!= frog
 MSmits: yeah but is he a toad or a frog, i keep forgetting
 Astrobytes: Toad! Hypnotoad!
 MSmits: oh right
 wlesavo: i would eat a toad as well
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I need to go work on my AI course
 MSmits: supposed to get a big part of that done this week. Havent got anything else to do
 Astrobytes: shouldn't take you long 
 MSmits: I am designing this course
 Astrobytes: ahhh OK
 Astrobytes: that's awesome
 MSmits: I want to at least pick the topics
 MSmits: yeah its basically a study project and also used for work
 MSmits: so doubly effective
 Astrobytes: That's very handy indeed
 MSmits: the hardest part is coming up with interesting activities that dont require coding that is complicated
 MSmits: most of them only have basic python skills
 Astrobytes: why are they doing an AI course then?
 MSmits: cuz we picked that subject for our curriculum&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: it's one of the many optional ones
 MSmits: they have to do 4 optional subjects
 MSmits: optional as in, the school chooses what to teach
 Astrobytes: Ah right, 'additional interest' subjects
 MSmits: yeah they alll do it though, I'll make sure there's some basic topics and some harder topics and assignments in there
 MSmits: for those with more skills
 MSmits: I want to at least try and get some BFS, DFS and simple minimax in. Mostly monkey-see-monkey-do
 Astrobytes: they just get a 'pass/fail' as opposed to a grade on these optional subjects? Or it counts the same as their mandatory subjects?
 MSmits: then for NN's and such I'll use the tensor flow website I think, there's probably other good free stuff
 MSmits: whatever the school decides to grade them, there's no reason to do the grading different for these
 MSmits: they are optional but not considered less important
 Astrobytes: OK. Was just thinking back to my 'short courses' at school, they were pass/fail as opposed to full grades
 MSmits: ahh ok, well this is not exactly short. It's 2-3 months
 MSmits: only 3 hrs a week though
 Astrobytes: Well mines were a full year lol
 MSmits: wow nice
 Astrobytes: But just one or 2 classes a week
 Astrobytes: (school year that is)
 MSmits: nah this is graded, but we can also do pass/fail, which is not necessarily easy, it just depends on how hard it is to pass
 Astrobytes: true
 MSmits: thies is also doing this course
 Astrobytes: Cool. He was doing alright on CG right?
 MSmits: so I have to keep him in the back of my head when designing the extra stuff
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: he writes bots quickly
 MSmits: bit like euler/illedan etc. Obviously with less experience. He sees a multi and gets a working bot in less than a day
 Astrobytes: It's nice when you see someone taking an interest and diving in like that eh 
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: anyways, I gotta run. Catch you later 
 MSmits: cya!
 jacek: oh new puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: congrats to Eric
 eulerscheZahl: Onitama got 101 new players during that week
 eulerscheZahl: 63 in almost a full yearthen 101 in a single week
 darkhorse64: A CP orgy
 jacek: umm
 jacek: i hope you dont know what that means
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it gained relevance for the global leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: and a new multiplayer pending already
 jacek: perhaps someone will be better than remi
 darkhorse64: In French, orgy is not so strong. Sorry about that
 eulerscheZahl: let's say "festival"
 eulerscheZahl: or ogre?
 darkhorse64: A arming party&#160;?
 darkhorse64: *farming*
 jacek: i meant cp. is it codinggame point?
 darkhorse64: Yeah
 Master_Yi: It is all ogre now
 MindController: anyone know whats this?
 MindController: ERROR: ld.so: object 'libstdbuf.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
 jacek: oO
 darkhorse64: No, but it does not hurt you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MindController I dropped it in discord error channel, i think someone put in a trouble ticket.  i started noticing it when i put define("",...); in my code .  it doesn't seem to hurt anything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think it has something to do with temporary file directory access
 AnOnY: hello 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: malicious code is still being injected imho thru the site, maybe the error is part of the attempt to stop it 
 jacek: how would you know...? :thinking:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek I'm getting yellow&#160;! processes in my task manager linked to my video card.  only when I login to CG do they come up
 MSmits: why are you getting yellow? This sounds like a medical problem to me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've updated my video card drivers since, and they still come up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i could look into the event manager logs... but I'm lazy
 eulerscheZahl: pixi.js is really GPU-heavy for what you get in return
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pixijs.io/examples/">https://pixijs.io/examples/</a>open a few of them and tell us if this is yellow too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: new containers show up, not errored tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there are empty css image objects in the web dev that could have flash objects inserted... i dunno, maywhen the random number msgs 37348728 pop up in chat?  i just shutdown the errored contaners and hit play, nothing new pops up ... i'll check again when/if i get a msg from random acct
 eulerscheZahl: happens to all of us
 eulerscheZahl: i think there's a correlation with receiving private messages
 eulerscheZahl: i get messaged, close the chat and then it opens again. and that weird number chat too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't have one at the moment, but i did 15 minutes ago
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you click over to it, it says it's trying to connect... so there is something not good going on
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, it's just codingamers from the Ancient Times trying to break through to us
 eulerscheZahl: reported on the discord bugs channel by multiple users
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's not hard to break with the java crossovers to discord and such
 PatrickMcGinnisII: something is trying to run on my GPU that shouldn't be at these times
 PatrickMcGinnisII: might be trying to attach to shadowplay container and stream from cams
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't have a cam attached, so would come up as error
 Astrobytes: afaik nobody else has reported anything similar, perhaps a local issue for you?
 Astrobytes: (wrt the GPU issues)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i ran spyware and virus crap a few days ago....nothing
 Astrobytes: Driver issue? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I reupped it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: over the years...same hardware, same software...this is new phenomena
 Astrobytes: Old GPU?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i really thing some of the added functionality has opened a hole that someone is trying to use ... and failing at, I hope
 MSmits: almost like a lovecraft story
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my local server doesn't have any connections that shouldn't be there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nor the router
 Astrobytes: If your GPU is old it might be having trouble with some aspects of pixi/another part of the site?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well i thought it might be my youtube adblocker, but I found its unrealted
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unrelated
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i used a few differrent browsers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: as well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i do get the..CG isn't compatible with your browser anymore warning
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe it's just that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dunno, I'll shutup ... but someone is trying to do stupid sh*t
 MSmits: someone always is
 MSmits: sometimes it's me
 MSmits: I'm selecting my AI topics. So far I got:
 MSmits: search algorithms
 MSmits: machine learning
 MSmits: maybe a separate thing about adversarial search
 MSmits: probably big data
 MSmits: computer vision
 MSmits: some of these are related
 MSmits: hard to split them up
 MSmits: I'm looking at other courses online, see what they did
 Astrobytes: yes, check other syllabi for inspiration is best I think
 MSmits: mmh constraint satisfaction and optimization problems are cool too
 MSmits: can be really easy to code examples for this
 MSmits: like simulated annealing. That seems within reach of my students
 jacek: genetic algorithm?
 MSmits: too complicated for them to code themselves I think, but I bet there are places where you can take code and tinker with it 
 MSmits: some visual example 
 MSmits: not everyhing in the course has to be a coding exercise
 MSmits: preferably not even half
 jacek: already 3 more people in d&amp;b wood1
 Majeck: d&amp;b?
 MSmits: dots and boxes
 Majeck: Oh
 Majeck: Thanks
 jacek: drum&amp;bass
 jacek: i still need to do proper search
 MSmits: death &amp; beyond
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: I have a solver that solves all endgames, but I made it so complicated that it's hell to get it into a working bot
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: I like the huge different in mine and your approaches :D
 jacek: so far *you claim* you have solver
 jacek: there is no proof of that
 Illedan: true
 MSmits: that's true
 Illedan: I even coded d&amp;b in the online IDE :P
 MSmits: I solved wood 2 :P
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: i think it was very funny that solving it made my bot play worse than using a simple heuristic
 MSmits: it already knew it had lost half the time before the game  started, so it barely even tried
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness</a>
 MSmits: 1 -3 is the solved score I think
 MSmits: or 3 -1 i forget
 MSmits: are you saying i made my bot depressed jacek?
 jacek: a pinnacle of machine learning eh
 MSmits: heh I guess so
 Shadowtick: hello
 Majeck: "ERROR: ld.so: object 'libstdbuf.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored." Is a CG side bug, right?
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: eeyup
 ZarthaxX: MSmits i think you are overshooting a bit with your expectations 
 ZarthaxX: of your students capabilities 
 eulerscheZahl: wow, a ZarthaxX appeared
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, a ZarthaxX appeared :P
 jacek: oh ZarthaxX appeared
 eulerscheZahl: and a parrot as well :o
 ZarthaxX: stop tagging me sheez
 ZarthaxX: yeah i have been missing for.. months?
 ZarthaxX: hi yall, how you been
 Majeck: Stop tagging who ZarthaxX?
 eulerscheZahl: but did you bring struct with you?
 ZarthaxX: i hate you Majeck
 jacek: Automaton2000 who is ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl no :rofl:
 Automaton2000: i'm just glad to help
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: is he missing??
 eulerscheZahl: yes, for 3 months
 ZarthaxX: tobou too? :P
 jacek: i didnt find him in java either
 eulerscheZahl: might be rotting in his basement by now, no idea
 ZarthaxX: hell no&#160;:(
 jacek: he will return for the contest to delete his account afterwards
 ZarthaxX: how are you guys doing 
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: going back to office about 2 days a week now
 eulerscheZahl: working only from home for 5 months
 ZarthaxX: well, you are better than in argentina
 ZarthaxX: "lockdown" for 200 days now
 ZarthaxX: i hate this country
 jacek: i have holiday for 1.5 weeks
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that sounds frustrating
 jacek: you dont like lockdown?
 ZarthaxX: amazing
 jacek: remote work*
 ZarthaxX: who are you asking that?
 jacek: you :v
 eulerscheZahl: you are the one whom we haven't seen for ages
 ZarthaxX: it's not remote work what i hate haha, i love that
 ZarthaxX: but by lockdown i mean "you need permission to use your car"
 jacek: huh
 ZarthaxX: "shops still closed"
 ZarthaxX: economy just going down
 jacek: wah
 Astrobytes: oh wow, a Zartholatron!
 jacek: thats really shit then
 ZarthaxX: yes, the politicians here are just dumb
 ZarthaxX: they dont get what they are doing
 eulerscheZahl: good job for not pinging poor ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: I never use his proper name :P
 jacek: AutomatonNN would never do that
 AutomatonNN: more code is always fine
 Majeck: What a fine piece of wisdom
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you missed the mod updates
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes mah man
 jacek: just like cucumber counterstrike?
 ZarthaxX: how you been modAstro
 Majeck: AutomatonNN should I write 3000 lines without testing a single one?
 AutomatonNN: for CSB
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl yeah, congratz haha
 ZarthaxX: it was time already
 Majeck: Thanks Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you will need to do this
 Majeck: If you say so
 Astrobytes: Same old crap ZarthaxX, how are you?
 ZarthaxX: stressed by uni and this country :p
 ZarthaxX: and i have been diving into security
 Astrobytes: I have the same country-stress here
 ZarthaxX: interesting world
 ZarthaxX: well, area i mean
 Astrobytes: Nightclubs or computer security? :P
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i think i can beat you on that :P
 ZarthaxX: computer security haha
 eulerscheZahl: here in Germany numbers are also going up again.so far we can still meet and I can play soccer
 jacek: paper?
 ZarthaxX: oh man, i miss doing excercise ..&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but a 2nd lockdown is definitely possible
 jacek: why would you call it soccer not football?
 eulerscheZahl: :soccer: :football:
 Astrobytes: We're on extra COVID measures in my part of Scotland, full lockdown will be soon I think. Still haven't had my bone density scan btw
 ZarthaxX: the park next block has been closed since march toad
 ZarthaxX: i just cant stand this&#160;:(
 jacek: be a rebel
 Astrobytes: Way too long
 jacek: do exerice!
 ZarthaxX: jump the fence? :p
 Majeck: I live in Chile and so far I think it's gone pretty well in the country
 eulerscheZahl: for you that was a lockdown during winter at least
 Shadowtick: can someone help me figure out why my code isn't working because I am thinking my nextcheckpointangle is messing it up
 ZarthaxX: true true, if it extends till summer tho
 jacek: man i always was so antisocial and anti sport, i wish the lockdown was when i was going to school
 Astrobytes: can't see it going away anytime soon&#160;:/
 Majeck: I mean the worst cities get full on quarantine but at least where I live we just have curfew and a "pls don't go see other people pls"
 ZarthaxX: i think all of us wish that jacek haha
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes no&#160;;( how are you and your family's health
 eulerscheZahl: he's running again
 ZarthaxX: woohoo
 jacek: i think people are more concerned about their business that virus itself
 Astrobytes: Grandad's in a home now, rest of family is good, I'm still shit
 ZarthaxX: why?
 eulerscheZahl: but you wrote "gotta run" just a few hours ago?
 Astrobytes: I ain't even had my scan yet
 Astrobytes: "gotta run" = got to go for now
 AntiSquid: hi zayed123
 jacek: "gotta run to toiler"
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX hi
 eulerscheZahl: oh&#160;:(
 Majeck: jacek business as in a store or business as in each one's life?
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: So I'm just sitting here on painkillers indefinitely
 jacek: i mean, government in single day can shut down your business and what can you do?
 AntiSquid: still got delayed treatment astro?
 Astrobytes: So many small businesses destroyed
 AntiSquid: like how many months do you have to wait?
 Astrobytes: Yeah AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: This has been since what, May or something?
 Astrobytes: Gonna be longer now with new restrictions
 Astrobytes: And it's no better, if I overdo it I suffer the consequences
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid heyo squido
 ZarthaxX: how are you
 AntiSquid: i need to have some allergic reaction checked, not sure from what it is, glad it's not that severe, waiting from january for an appointment that was finally booked in june for decemeber :D Astrobytes
 ZarthaxX: scan for what Astrobytes? sounds awful 
 eulerscheZahl: bone density
 Majeck: AntiSquid why do you have to wait so long for an appointment?
 Astrobytes: Jeez AntiSquid, wow! Yeah, I guess if it was severe enough you'd get the appointment
 AntiSquid: because of the virus Majeck
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Everything is opened back up in Fla., people and govt. sick of it...they just ready to let it kill 1% of everyone off
 AntiSquid: mass panic
 Astrobytes: What euler said ZarthaxX
 AntiSquid: im fine ZarthaxX are you doing the unofficial contest? how's school? still teaching right?
 Majeck: PatrickMcGinnisII We're handling it like the best in the world, believe me, no one is handling better than us
 ZarthaxX: ah, i thought it was that
 ZarthaxX: that has been since may as you said right? wtf
 AntiSquid: are you from Florida PatrickMcGinnisII?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, around then
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid no im not... what is it about? doubt i have time
 Astrobytes: It's code of ice and fire
 AntiSquid: i can't think of any real game that is like it, so
 ZarthaxX: and yeah im still teaching, preparing some things to show in class , virtual classes are cool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes antiS I'm a FLNERD
 ZarthaxX: switching between tabs in chrome to show stuff quickly is amazing :P
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes oh known game okey, so ppl from here already have advantage
 Astrobytes: It's judged on progression tho
 AntiSquid: what's with the florida hate in the news? i kinda noticed some bias there 
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, it's a "contest" after all
 eulerscheZahl: just promoting an existing game, nothing too thrilling
 PatrickMcGinnisII: FL hate?  I don't watch news, all garbage
 Astrobytes: My contest code is so scary, I updated it a wee while ago but to do anything further I need to rewrite... donno if I can be bothered
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl good point
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rewriting COIF is so annoying for me
 eulerscheZahl: i proposed an original game. but CG didn't want to host it before the next official contest&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Still not sure on that logic but whatever
 AntiSquid: i agree with the news and garbage words being used in same sentence, but i tend to get bored with lockdown PatrickMcGinnisII
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we'll see it in january
 Astrobytes: Hope so
 ZarthaxX: but it will be hosted later? :P
 ZarthaxX: ah nice
 eulerscheZahl: still not decided
 Astrobytes: If it doesn't come back as contest, petition to have it as PotW :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: goveernor of fla. openened everything back up, but my GF is a teacher and they had 4 cases of CoV in her school last week, so she is pretty f'kd, if she doesn't go to work they take her pension away.
 eulerscheZahl: the game is finished. i'll publish it for sure. one way or another
 Astrobytes: Perhaps we can do unofficial like with BitRunner
 eulerscheZahl: that's like 10% of a real contest in player count
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, but I mean if we don't get it as a contest. Just advertise it a lot 
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we get it, won't think about a plan B yet
 Astrobytes: Well, fingers crossed
 eulerscheZahl: or maybe you don't even like the game :thinking:
 AntiSquid: crowdfund the contest prizes if it's unofficial ... htere are crowdfunds for all sorts of completely retarded shit, so why not for a contest :P
 Astrobytes: Doesn't matter, contests are always good for the community whether I like the game personally or not
 ZarthaxX: it revives the chat
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Astrobytes: this is also true lol
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl did riddle prize ever arrive?
 Dysta: henlo
 ZarthaxX: hellou
 ZefusToutCourt: I can’t beat the boss 3

 eulerscheZahl: hm, hacktoberfest is running
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/</a>

 eulerscheZahl: and you can claim a tshirt
 mohamed1406: give me an example
 Majeck: Is there a Wood 1 boss for dots and boxes?
 Astrobytes: No, that's the top league
 Majeck: Oh
 Majeck: Will there ever be a silver league?
 Astrobytes: Probably not
 Majeck: Awwwwww
 Astrobytes: Since it's a community multiplayer
 Majeck: So the goal is just to try to get the best ranking I can in wood 1?
 Astrobytes: Oh if you're really into it just keep playing, community multis are more about getting high as you can in a smaller league
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: They tend to be a little harder than regular multis (ex-contests) so only a select group tend to play them
 Astrobytes: So the competition is usually quite fierce&#160;;)
 Majeck: Oh ok
 Majeck: Thanks for the help
 Majeck: :D
 Astrobytes: no worries&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl 4 pull requests doesnt seem like much.. but you do some good contribution i guess
 Astrobytes: Does it mean I can just create some crap project on github, then log in with another account and make pull requests?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that i will participate in hacktoberfest
 eulerscheZahl: i think yes Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol wtf
 Astrobytes: I'd be ashamed to own the shirt

 DomiKo: give me contest with this T-Shirt as reward and I would love to compete
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i always decided not to play hacktoberfest, even if it's probably the easiest tshirt of the year

 eulerscheZahl: i had a facebook account for maybe 2 hours many years ago. despite my will
 eulerscheZahl: someone created an account with my name and his email address, then changed the mail
 Astrobytes: yeah, works well DomiKo
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and there was no check if the owner of the new mail is willing to do so
 DomiKo: XD
 eulerscheZahl: spent 15min to delete the account
 Astrobytes: Not missing much. I gave up on that platform a long time ago
 eulerscheZahl: including some really nasty captchas
 eulerscheZahl: bed time. getting winter, so i'm beyond my time already

 Laminator: If not an 11 year old, who else would be told a noob? 
 Laminator: I guess the only person left is Joe
 Laminator: Joe Mama! Ohhhhhhhhhhh
 Sylarb91: good morning. can anyone help me a little on some piece of code&#160;?
 Sylarb91: c#
 EquinoxWhale: me noob, Sadge
 huss3: guys what do they mean with "following lines"
 huss3: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a4edf8f-bdaa-4ad6-ba5f-3041a8c67bc7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a4edf8f-bdaa-4ad6-ba5f-3041a8c67bc7</a>
 huss3: im hella confused
 Allis: It's... pretty straightforward?
 VizGhar: How does the "bot programming" contests work? I just want to know, wheter there is some higher league in Dots and Boxes then Wooden one
 VizGhar: I can't see any Boss on wooden league - lvl2
 Allis: @huss3 A lot of languages can't just magically read all the input; they need to be told how many lines to consume.
 Allis: So a lot of the problem statements contain the number of lines to read as the first line so that people writing in those languages have a reliable way of consuming the input.
 Allis: "Following" in  this case means something like "comes after".
 huss3: OH
 jacek: VizGhar in d&amp;b there is boss in wood2, then there is wood1 and nothing more
 jacek: d&amp;b is community game
 pluieciel: Hi all, I am doing "The Bridge". I find a confusing fact: when I run TESTCASE, sometimes it passes, sometimes not. and the Submit give different pass ratio each time.
 pluieciel: what could be the reason? thanks
 KiwiTae: if you have rng in your solution might happen
 KiwiTae: random#
 pluieciel: nope
 pluieciel: no random in code
 KiwiTae: do you time out?
 pluieciel: yeah, when not pass, the error is "time out", but I calculate some of the time, &lt;50 msec, far smaller than the limit of 150msec 
 KiwiTae: ~ if you time out thats why u dont always pass~
 KiwiTae: make sure you finish turn before 150ms
 pluieciel: feel like the time is not stable
 KiwiTae: yea its not~
 pluieciel: i mean change too much from once to another
 KiwiTae: maybe dont try to solve it in 1 turn just can dfs depth 3
 pluieciel: ok I will try, thanks!!
 pluieciel: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e9dba5c6-c251-4642-95b7-284bec124e8a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e9dba5c6-c251-4642-95b7-284bec124e8a</a>
 pluieciel: Standard Error Stream:1st split time: 22.782039 msecsfinish time: 55.859746 msecs
 pluieciel: seems not a timeout issue, but timeout comes randomly
 Q12: the paste bin doesn't work

 Q12: has bug
 pluieciel: ok

 Ownguali: Hello guys
 Nutsa: coucou
 Ownguali: tg
 Shadowtick: hi
 LinhT.Nguyen: GRATZZZZ MOFOO
 Ownguali: GRATZZO MOZERELLA MAMA
 Shadowtick: huhhh?????????????
 Shadowtick: I am getting even more confused
 Ownguali: if la mere a ronan &gt; tour eiffelSystem.out.preintln("La mere a ronan est enorme")
 Nutsa: i'm confused
 Nutsa: WTF MEN
 Ownguali: calm down
 Ownguali: sale con
 Shadowtick: I don't understand certain languages
 Shadowtick: because I know mostly english
 Ownguali: im saying that nutsa's mom is bigger than the eiffel tower
 Shadowtick: but I know some Russian and some korean
 Ownguali: salagnae
 Astrobytes: Stop the nonsense Ownguali, Nutsa or you'll get kicked
 Shadowtick: oop
 Ownguali: *Ownguali leave the room*
 Nutsa: sorry i m calm now
 Uljahn: stop being edgy teen, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i mean u need to convert it to a different game
 Shadowtick: I am just gonna go to the chat that lets me talk in korean
 Shadowtick: so bye
 Nutsa: ownguali fdp
 Astrobytes: watch your language
 Astrobytes: go to #fr
 Shadowtick: wait that is french isnt it?
 Ownguali: it is
 Astrobytes: yes
 Shadowtick: wow I guess I learned some french from my sister after all
 Shadowtick: :3 I can tell somehow
 ByBoSs4: yeah go FR ownguali 
 Shadowtick: but anyways imma go learn more Korean and Russian
 ByBoSs4: nice
 jacek: omelette du fromage?
 ByBoSs4: baguette fromage ahahah
 Ownguali: Stop laughing about french people, they're so friendly
 Ownguali:&#160;:)
 ByBoSs4: tepu ownguali
 Astrobytes: Quit the swearing already

 eulerscheZahl: ah, i have to transpose the text
 Astrobytes: in this case it's an easy one
 Ownguali: it means bitch in french :confounded:
 Astrobytes: I know, thank you
 Astrobytes: Stop the unnecessary swearing
 Ownguali: ok
 jacek: bloody hell
 Nutsa: :heart_eyes:
 jacek: what are teaching Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN
 Automaton2000: so this is a general chat
 AutomatonNN: I was just thinking of a more efficient compared to c++ or more
 Shadowtick: I think this needs a censor option to censor cussing in all languages
 Astrobytes: No, there's no need for censorship. People are free to swear in context, no language fascists here.
 NMVuong: i don't understand output 
 Shadowtick: I mean like for people that aren't allowed to see cussing that is what I mean by that Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Avert thy eyes young Shadowtick, lest they burn with the profanity :PI see your point but the majority of people are OK with it 
 Astrobytes: NMVuong: it's like input, but the other way round&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: *thine eyes
 Shadowtick: I know but I just am throwing out a idea
 Astrobytes: feel free to suggest it on the forum
 Shadowtick: ok
 Shadowtick: which forum do I need to go to?

 Illedan: Oh, Yurkov and Westicles are closing in too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: beaten in my own game. again&#160;:(
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: I guess you have less motivation for your own game?
 eulerscheZahl: same motivation in terms of time i spend
 eulerscheZahl: but creating it costs time too
 TomasV: Is there a way to see what exactly failed on animated "game" puzzles after submitting on the validator page? I keep failing one testcase and since it works on IDE validators I have no idea what is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: validators are usually different to IDE testcases
 eulerscheZahl: seems you don't cover an edge case
 TomasV: Thanks, but I know about that, the thing is it's the Skynet revolution - episode 1 and the only thing different there are numbers, which shouldn't matter at all since I use a graph, thats why I'm asking if there is any debug info or anything similar to see, like if I didn't provide any input or what exactly is the problem 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uyjjx8">https://prnt.sc/uyjjx8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can watch the replays after your submit
 eulerscheZahl: note: that doesn't work for all puzzles
 TomasV: yeah, but the agent just stops and nothing happens, thats the thing
 eulerscheZahl: that's unfortunate. there's no simple way to debug this
 TomasV: well it seems like I did something wrong about the input, that's my best guess
 TomasV: thanks for you help
 TomasV: your*
 TomasV: The problem was actually array size - not sure why, but since I was sure the input didn't look suspicious I thought maybe out of bounds exception could be the culprit and when I initialized my severed edges pair to size nodes*2 , it works like a charm. Thanks once again for the help
 VicPopescu: hi, anyone done the puzzle of the week? I have a test case that I just can't figure out how to get to 101 because it's impossible with the puzzle rules
 eulerscheZahl: huh, what is the puzzle of the week in your opinion?
 Dartisan: Puzzle of the Week you mean Dots and Boxes?
 eulerscheZahl: la pipopipette
 Dartisan: Yes, a nice challenge, have only invest a short moment in it now for have a basic understanding. Later it will become challenging, to keep the turn and archive as much points as possible by a Pathfinding. Should be something for you. Only get in the next league with more fields&#160;;-)
 VicPopescu: yeap, dots and boxes
 Dartisan: my current solution is a quick-win in using simply the valid moves proposed and a short logic, so no real AI and Algo yet, but I a have a vision.
 VicPopescu: well, I have a complex algorithm already, but I need to step back maybe and have a look at the core concept again
 Dartisan: Perhaps, I don't know, as for the rule, when you fill a box, you get the next turn would be more clear and the algo more useful on a 3x3. Had some tries till get it in the second league, and remember had also many draws.
 Dartisan: But the puzzle itself I find real nice. Has some new elements to discover for me.
 YUHBOI: sup
 johnysins: Hi geeks 
 Shadowtick: can I have some help with dots and boxes because I am wanting to do it because it's the puzzle of the week
 Puzo: HI world
 Puzo: hellooo
 malpk: hi
 OmerDrk: I am glad I find such a website
 Shadowtick: hello
 Shadowtick: and what do you mean by that OmerDrk
 OmerDrk: Shadowtick (my english may be incorrect) I mean I didnt know there is this like a website full of coding puzzles etc
 Shadowtick: Ok and if you need help with javascript on puzzles I completed let me know
 Shadowtick: because I will help you with them
 OmerDrk: ok thnks
 jacek: its not only for clashing ;v
 Shadowtick: I dont do clashes
 Shadowtick: so those yeah dont look at me for help
 jacek: do you need some help with dots and boxes?
 Shadowtick: yes
 Shadowtick: I do need help
 jacek: what help
 jacek: dbdr youre gonna let some noob be better at d&amp;b than you?
 Shadowtick: I don't know what I need to do to make it put more than one line down because after one line it says invalid input and in the standard output stream it says shadowtick played a invalid move
 jacek: you need to print one line at a time in the loop
 Shadowtick: oh?
 jacek: you only make one move per turn
 jacek: though in d&amp;b you may get several turns one after another
 Shadowtick: ok?
 jacek: you never did multiplayer game here before?
 Shadowtick: I did coders strike back/csb before
 jacek: and there you also print one command at a time
 Shadowtick: I know
 dbdr: jacek: is a noob who invented MCTS really a noob?
 Nerchio: do you guys know what JDK is ice and fire?

 Nerchio: thanks
 jacek: well he didnt invent jacekmax
 Shadowtick: wait a minute that seems weird that I forgot how to  make something I always make on p5.js
 Nerchio: any ideas about why codingame doesn't read this properly?
 Nerchio: error: cannot find symbol
 Nerchio: ups no pastebin :D
 Nerchio: error: cannot find symbol
 MadKnight: because there is no such property
 MadKnight: lol
 Nerchio: but its not correct thats the problem :D
 MadKnight: well looks like it is
 MadKnight: correct
 Nerchio: -_-
 MadKnight: try to understand why there is no such property
 Shadowtick: hey MadKnight nice to see ya
 Nerchio: if i change this code to !isPresent() instead of isempty it works
 eulerscheZahl: westNeighbor? do you also have notrh, south and east? who codes like that?
 Nerchio: idk what else can i do :D
 eulerscheZahl: are arrays not invented in java yet?
 eulerscheZahl: or lists
 Nerchio: depends how you code it i guess
 Nerchio: I don't think its bad
 eulerscheZahl: way easier to iterate over all neighbors
 Nerchio: but i see your point
 Nerchio: yeah i guess that makes sense to use array in this case :D
 pharesmostafa: hi world
 OmerDrk: hi
 pharesmostafa: iwhat language did u use
 pharesmostafa: i use c++
 pharesmostafa:&#160;:)
 pharesmostafa:&#160;:(

 pluieciel: Hi again, just wonder is there anyone could help me check my "random timeout" issue in The Bridge Ep2 with Clojure?
 pluieciel: submit sucess rate varies between 0% to 91%

 Astrobytes: pluieciel: it seems some people are reporting random timeouts with some puzzles and multiplayers, could be that. My clojure skills are not good enough to debug that unfortunately&#160;;)
 pharesmostafa:&#160;:.(
 pharesmostafa:&#160;: . (
 AntiSquid: clojure times out even for 2048 when you only output up . i just want to get the +1 on the language
 Bob: Clojure, aka "why am I doing this to myself?"
 AntiSquid: aka i wouldn't use it if the site didn't have language achivements
 Bob: actually it was kinda fun to practice it enough to get Roller Coaster done
 Bob: god I scared him away
 Bob: T_T
 pluieciel: Roller Coaster is just where I begin to know it haha :laughing:
 Bob: too bad you won't ever use it for anything else XD
 Bob: but well in that category at least it's more interesting than VB.Net
 magaiti: experienced fortran programmers can write fortran code in any programming language
 magaiti: applies to closure most of the tiem as well
 Zenoscave: I think that applies to most languages most of the time magaiti
 magaiti: if your mind is not bent the lisp way, you'll use closure as a blunt tool
 Bob: I think my Roller Coaster code is more or less a port of my C++ version
 Bob: possibly just  bit bent, though&#160;:)
 N0rtz: Hi everyone
 Majeck: WOAHHHHH
 Majeck: I just realized that your eyes do the "black dots" optical illusion trick on the dots and boxes display
 Majeck: That's awesome!
 Majeck: You ever feel like the biggest idiot in the whole wide world?
 Majeck: You ever feel like the biggest idiot in the whole wide world?
 Majeck: Don't know why it was sent twice
 Majeck: Anyways I hit a bug in my code and long story short after two hours I realized that I had a function that copied a class, but when I printed the copy it wasn't the same as the original
 Majeck: So I spent over an hour inspecting the copy code trying to find an error but I couldn't 
 Majeck: Well it turns out the bug was way back in another unrelated part
 Majeck: I had a list of characters and a string that were supposed to hold the same information
 Majeck: (inside a class)
 Majeck: Well turns out that a few lines back I had edited the list of characters BUT NOT the string
 Majeck: Well, at least future Majeck knows why you're code was bugging past Majeck
 Laminator: Now you just need a way for future Majeck to prove you are past Majeck from the future
 Laminator: I just wanna say that I'm really sad AlkhilJohn is just a bot

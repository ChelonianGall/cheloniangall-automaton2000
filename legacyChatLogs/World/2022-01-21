 NovaSHPP: it's hard, but fun

 oiweg: hi guys
 TheUndyingClown_f05: hi daddy
 ladN:&#160;:*
 oiweg: what is your name?
 oiweg: :rage:
 Rebollo: :slight_frown:
 oiweg: :flushed:
 Rebollo: Folks, what if I have this class structure:
 Rebollo: Class A {}
 oiweg: ITS MEAN THAT U R FAY
 oiweg: GAY*
 oiweg: just joke
 Rebollo: And you are ature
 oiweg: sry
 Rebollo: mature
 Rebollo: np
 Rebollo: Class A{}
 Rebollo: And a Need to print its childs contents
 Rebollo: having a array o A
 Rebollo: But each of the childs require diferent logic on print function because the are different types
 therealbeef: you have an array of A or pointers/references to A?
 Rebollo: the Array contains child1 and child2
 therealbeef: hmm, is this about c++?
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: Class A (parent)Class child2Class child2
 Rebollo: Array  of type A = [child1Obj, child2Obj]
 Rebollo: would like to call
 therealbeef: that's impossible&#160;:)
 therealbeef: all elements of an array have to be of the same type
 Rebollo: A[0]-&gt;print()
 kurtesy: Aloha
 therealbeef: it's useful to distinguish two different kind of types: static type and dynamic type. Static type is what you actually say it is in the code. Dynamic type is what the object actually is in memory. so when you have std::array&lt;A*, 2&gt; you get an array where all elements have static type 'pointer to A'. But they can have dynamic type child1 and child2: std::array&lt;A*,2&gt; = {&amp;child1Obj, &amp;child2Obj};
 Rebollo: like this right?

 Rebollo: This works
 Rebollo: different types in the same array
 Rebollo: Now how can I genericly print their values, onde they have different properties?
 Rebollo: once*
 therealbeef: In your code the array consists of objects of type Area (not pointers). When you then assign an object of type Grass to it, it converts the gg object to an Area object, so area[1] is not pointing to the gg object
 therealbeef: polymorphism only works through pointers or references
 Rebollo: :nerd:
 therealbeef: Area** array = new (Area*)[10];array[0] = bb;array[1] = gg;
 BobaAndBiba: hi i Boba , your ban my brother Biba, i angry:rage::rage:, За россию&#160;!!!!!:flag_ru::flag_ru:
 Rebollo: OMG
 Rebollo: I just used Area** to create a matrix of Area
 therealbeef: nah, just an array of pointers&#160;:-)

 Rebollo: added this childs (different types)
 Rebollo: but still cant acess a propertie

 Rebollo: Ball* bb = new Ball(5,5,5);Grass* gg = new Grass();
 Rebollo: But can´t reach a propertie of Ball
 Rebollo: inside the array
 Rebollo: array[0] = bb;array[1] = gg;
 Rebollo: A propertie only related to the child
 Rebollo: for example Ball-&gt;Size

 Rebollo: like the colors representing states
 Rebollo: or something like that
 Rebollo: because let´s say I have 5 states for each char
 Rebollo: I would  like to see it in a understandable way instead of choosing diferent characters for each state for each character
 Rebollo: would result in a huge combination and I will not be able to understand it anymore
 Rebollo: cout &lt;&lt; "\033[1;31mbold red text\033[0m\n";
 Rebollo: trying to use something like that but
 struct: yes its possible
 struct: but cg doesnt handle it
 struct: so its not possible on cg
 Rebollo: thanks
 Rebollo: is this because of the server type? What the reason? Operational system? Just for curiosity
 struct: because its handled as html
 struct: or just text I think
 Uljahn: might be a unification (and simplification) of the output console to equally support 27 programming languages
 Uljahn: also custom colorizing might conflict with dark/light themes or something
 Rebollo: nice to know thanks

 Rebollo: folks:
 Rebollo: In c++ I am able to call a copy contructor while creating a new object
 Rebollo: Area* tempArea = ballsVector[ballIndex];
 Rebollo: sorry
 Rebollo: like this
 Rebollo: Area* tempArea(ballsVector[ballIndex]);
 Rebollo: but I can´t make it work when I need to assign a existing object to another
 Rebollo: like a simple assigment
 Rebollo: is it possible to call a copy constructor?
 Rebollo: Because when I do the assigment with simple =
 Rebollo: I dont want to copy all the properties
 Uljahn: do you want to copy/assign a selected set of properties to another object?
 therealbeef: what you're assigning in the code you posted is a pointer
 Rebollo: I have two nodes, they are in diferent positions of my tree..I want to swap their references of LEFT and RIGHT
 therealbeef: Area a;auto b = a; calls the copy-constructor
 Rebollo: Like change the position of the nodes
 Rebollo: without changing their data
 Rebollo: NodeA-&gt;left = NodeB-&gt;left
 Rebollo: NodeA-&gt;right = Nodeb-right
 Rebollo: and vice-versa
 therealbeef: are left and right pointers to objects? if so, what you wrote would work (though probably needs a tmp variable); it swaps the addresses pointed at
 Rebollo: yes they are pointers
 Rebollo: Hum I think I got it
 Rebollo: but there is something wrong because no matter how distant I go to the right
 Rebollo: I never get segmentation error
 therealbeef: you think there is a loop?
 therealbeef: editing trees can be tricky
 Rebollo: At least there is no explicity loop
 Rebollo: I just doing like this
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2652c5a5-6375-49c3-b6c1-6c071aa21d3c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2652c5a5-6375-49c3-b6c1-6c071aa21d3c</a>
 Rebollo: I think its poiting to itself somehow
 YurkovAS: *sourceObj = *targetObj;
 Rebollo: What?
 YurkovAS: this work as:auto b = a; calls the copy-constructor
 YurkovAS: *b = *a;// for pointers
 Rebollo: I am trying I think it is working
 Rebollo: 1 more minute
 Rebollo: something wrong like a cirsular reference
 Rebollo: but could figure out why
 Rebollo: circular*
 Rebollo: i think it is not calling the copy constructor
 Rebollo: I put a cout inside the copy constr
 Rebollo: but is not showing in the console..
 Rebollo: I did the copy contructor like this
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b122747-e3cb-4dee-8c88-32e849c9bcae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b122747-e3cb-4dee-8c88-32e849c9bcae</a>
 struct: why are you overwriting the copy constructor?
 struct: do you only want to copy certain elements?
 Rebollo: I have two Nodes:
 Rebollo: A
 Rebollo: and B
 Rebollo: each one has their own left and right pointers
 Rebollo: I want that e B start poiting to the a left and right
 Rebollo: and vice versa
 Rebollo: At the end I want to swap their places in the data structure
 struct: swap the place of a and b?
 Rebollo: yes a will point to the b pointers
 Rebollo: and b will point to the a pointers
 Rebollo: humm
 YurkovAS: maybe this is copy assignment
 Rebollo: is it possible to swap the memory adress? so I keep track of all the others nodes the were pointing to them?
 Rebollo: Because there might exist other nodes the point to them and If I change only their (A e B) reference
 Rebollo: this can be a mess
 Rebollo: basically
 Rebollo: Swap nodes in a linked list without swapping data
 struct: well you will have the problem that will still point to the same address 
 struct: if you swap A with B
 struct: everything that was pointing to A will now be poiting to the same address which is B
 therealbeef: if you have x - a - y - b - z, remember you will need to edit all 5 nodes
 struct: wich has B on it
 struct: unless i missunderstood
 Rebollo: Yes I think u get the problem
 Rebollo: So I need to handle manually
 Rebollo: no "smart" way or common used way to solve this problem?
 therealbeef: but why not leave a and b in place and just swap their content?
 therealbeef: the common way is never to use linked lists&#160;;-)
 Rebollo: because they have different types
 0xanas: :eyes:
 Rebollo: One node is type of ball
 Rebollo: the other is grass
 Rebollo: There is a parent class commom to them
 Rebollo: And in order to access specif properties of the childs
 Rebollo: I am doing
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3efa921-4848-4594-9b1c-3fc50bd8faad">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3efa921-4848-4594-9b1c-3fc50bd8faad</a>
 Rebollo: dynamic cast
 Rebollo: I though linked list were the best options for graphs
 Rebollo: binary trees
 Rebollo: fast searches
 Rebollo: why not?
 Rebollo: but each node hs up, down, left, right
 Rebollo: lots of references
 therealbeef: well, binary trees are not actually faster than vectors with linear search until you have a million nodes
 Rebollo: what about graphs
 Rebollo: Where some problems to be solved
 Rebollo: I dont need to much data que start getting slow
 Rebollo: like Waze
 Rebollo: routes
 Rebollo: Like a want to visit 100 places
 Rebollo: What would be the best track
 Rebollo: to save oil for example
 Rebollo: I can´t simply test all possibilities
 therealbeef: same. problem with linked lists is that they are scattered around memory, so it can't be optimized very well by the cpu
 Rebollo: humm
 therealbeef: you can represent a graph with a vector too
 Rebollo: I really like to swap their values only, but once they are different types
 Rebollo: But how would a represent a graph with a vector
 Rebollo: without keeping the positions references?
 therealbeef: instead of memory addresses you store indices
 Rebollo: sorry I don´t want to question your knowledge
 Rebollo: is the opposite
 Rebollo: I am trying to learning
 therealbeef: me too&#160;:)
 Rebollo: nice
 Rebollo: hum like hash?
 therealbeef: This is a nice presentation about performance of different data structures in c++: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/fHNmRkzxHWs">https://youtu.be/fHNmRkzxHWs</a>
 therealbeef: from c++ conference
 Rebollo: let me have a look
 therealbeef: basic message: use vectors unless you have really good reason
 Rebollo: it seems it is a common issue
 Rebollo: I found lots of references
 Rebollo: and like doing only for one pointer like next
 Rebollo: is already a big code
 Rebollo: At first glace seems simple
 Rebollo: I am trying to solve a puzzle which probably doest need that much care about the performance
 Rebollo: But I am focused in learning
 therealbeef: I think it's good to try different things and learn from them. so making your own linked grid can be very instructional, but you asked for common approach&#160;;)
 Rebollo: sure cause I thought I was going to far, wrong way, worst way
 Rebollo: I would like to hear some reference
 therealbeef: you approach should be possible to make it work, just a bit of headache&#160;:)
 therealbeef: *your
 TimV13-BBG-: it depends on what kind of software you make when it comes to performance. Higher performance usually means less readability.
 TimV13-BBG-: try making clean code at first, then look at performance
 Rebollo: you are right
 TimV13-BBG-: trying to make something run 'fast' can take a lot of time and will cause headaches xD
 therealbeef: *cough* data oriented design *cough*
 Rebollo: I was watching a sql expert developer that says that he prefers to create a readable code, maintainable to  to the detriment of performance for example 
 Rebollo: of course there are cases and cases
 Rebollo: Also he mentioned that you need to avoid comments
 Rebollo: The code mmust talk for itself
 Rebollo: because sometimes the speak language can be ambiguous or just don´t represent what the code  is doing
 Rebollo: That´s why I don´t understand ruby, do you?
 therealbeef: and functions should be 4 lines at most&#160;;)
 Rebollo: I went to a business intelligence pproject for exxon mobil
 Rebollo: SAP HANA database
 Rebollo: It a in memory data base
 Rebollo: I started to create the reporsts
 Rebollo: the goal was to run everything live
 Rebollo: without materializing the results
 Rebollo: I created a generic recursive function
 Rebollo: You just need to maintain a table
 TimV13-BBG-: never done anything in Ruby but code should indeed speak for itself
 Rebollo: to create all the metrics
 Rebollo: It turned out that the solution is too hard to maintain
 Rebollo: too hard to undertand
 Rebollo: And I realized the SQL is a static language
 Rebollo: So it would be better to have redundant code
 Rebollo: instead of generic things
 Rebollo: because once you have some problem
 Rebollo: All the solution depends of it
 Rebollo: I learned by making this mistaake
 Rebollo: never try to do a generic stuff anymore
 Rebollo: at least for this kink of language
 Rebollo: now I am not in the project anymore
 Rebollo: And I wonder how the guys will understand that sutff
 Rebollo: :grin:
 Rebollo: Once I crashed the server because of this recursive function..no body was able to kill the processes
 Rebollo: the were generated in paralell..
 therealbeef: code that speaks for itself is a good ideal, but in practice not really maintainable. Imagine a small function in a chain of functions; not always easy to see what it tries to do... but I agree it's something to strive for; at least have descriptive function and variable names
 Rebollo: perfect
 therealbeef: Interfaces are a different story of course&#160;;)
 Rebollo: actually there are some directions / best practices, but there is no wrong or right
 Rebollo: lways depends on the scenario
 Rebollo: but is awesome to take into account this aspects
 Rebollo: Folks
 Rebollo: Is it ok to use a Class function inside the contructor?
 Rebollo: Like lets say I need to generate a id
 Rebollo: And a call a generateIdFunction inside de contructor?
 Rebollo: Lets say this function is part of the same class
 therealbeef: sure, that's fine. sounds like it would be a static function though (so different instances of the class could have unique ids)
 Rebollo: different istances could have unique id?What do you mean?The same ID can be created in different instaces?
 Rebollo: or the Opposite?
 therealbeef: opposite
 Rebollo: I got 
 Rebollo: yes no problem
 therealbeef: static int get_id() { static int id = 0; return id++; }
 Rebollo: the ID will make sense only on the instace
 Rebollo: I will never compare different instances for example

 Rebollo: I am trying to sort a vector
 Rebollo: of pointers
 Rebollo: by the object id propertie
 Rebollo: Pointers-&gt;Ball-&gt;objId
 Rebollo: trying this
 Rebollo: static bool before( const Pointers&amp; c1, const Pointers&amp; c2 ) { return c1.area-&gt;uniqueId &lt; c2.area-&gt;uniqueId; }
 Rebollo: but I don´t know if I declare that in the Pointer class
 Rebollo: or in the ball class
 Rebollo: The vector is type Pointer
 Rebollo: has child type area
 Rebollo: that has child types
 Rebollo: ball
 Rebollo: grass
 Rebollo: water
 Rebollo: but all of the childs has a common uniqueId propertie
 Rebollo: And I want to sort the aarray by them
 Rebollo: uniqueID
 ninjadip: a vector of pointers? why not a linked list
 ninjadip: which sorting technique are you using
 Rebollo: I don´t know the name
 Rebollo: but
 Rebollo: using this sintaxe
 Rebollo: static bool before( const Area&amp; c1, const Area&amp; c2 ) { return c1.uniqueId &lt; c2.uniqueId; }
 Rebollo: like a compartions function
 Rebollo: I dont know if it is lambda
 Rebollo: and calling sort
 Rebollo: but once I have a array of Poiters of Areas of Balls
 Rebollo: Pointers &gt; Areas &gt; Balls
 Rebollo: I don´t know where to declare this comparison function
 Rebollo: Class GolfGame
 Rebollo: Has an array of Pointers
 Rebollo: Which has a pointer to Area
 ninjadip: i have more questions then answers, so sorry, i can't help
 Rebollo: Which point to Ball
 struct: sort(nodes.begin(), nodes.end(), [&amp;](Node* a, Node* b) {return a-&gt;visits &gt; b-&gt;visits; });
 struct: you want something like this?
 ninjadip: that looks good
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: but where do I declare it?
 Rebollo: which level?
 struct: what do you mean by level?
 Rebollo: I have 4 classes
 Rebollo: GolfGame has
 Rebollo: a array of POinter
 Rebollo: that has
 Rebollo: a pointer to Area
 Rebollo: That has childs of many types
 Rebollo: but all the child types has a uniqueId in common
 Rebollo: And I want to sort the a array of POinter by the uniqueId
 Rebollo: of their lowest level in the hierarchy
 struct: well I guess you either store in area the lowest unique id yet
 Rebollo: Class 1 has a vector of Class2 of type  Class 3 which has  objects of Class4
 struct: or you loop them when you sort
 struct: which wont be as efficient 
 Rebollo: Its pretty small data set
 Rebollo: I wa trying to use this approch
 Rebollo: sort(nodes.begin(), nodes.end(), [&amp;](Node* a, Node* b) {return a-&gt;visits &gt; b-&gt;visits; });
 Rebollo: in which level should I declare this guy?
 Rebollo: I am getting this error

 Rebollo: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Rebollo: I still dont understand the pointers
 Rebollo: sometimes use *
 Rebollo: sometimes &amp;
 Rebollo: sometimes new
 Rebollo: sometimes it overwrite the copy
 Rebollo: sometime don´t
 Rebollo: like the IDE quick fixes kind of perform a lot of work to me
 Rebollo: in this aspect
 struct: Which part dont you understand?
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Can someone maybe help me out with some tips where to start and how to start learning about machine learning in C++
 Rebollo: Like, when I am using a custom type, a class such as Ball..I alway create like basic types without pointer
 Rebollo: And custom type as pointer
 Rebollo: when I create a pointer
 Rebollo: It is necessarily a vector?
 Rebollo: When I need to instantiate with new
 Rebollo: And when don´t
 Rebollo: A vector is always apointer?
 Rebollo: A matrix is two pointers?
 ninjadip: two-dimensial array
 Rebollo: but internally
 Rebollo: it is a pointer?
 Rebollo: Why sometime a * is interpreted sa pointer
 Rebollo: and sometime as array?
 ninjadip: yay i finally landed this mf*?! mars lander
 5DN1L: :clap: ninjadip
 Rebollo: :heart_eyes:
 ninjadip: lol
 ninjadip: sorry, was stressful, they just kept dying... over and over
 Rebollo: Best sensation 
 struct: so you have pointers inside the Ball?
 struct: this is not always needed depends on what you are doing
 Rebollo: I have a class called Game is like the engine of everything
 Rebollo: The class called Game
 Rebollo: Has an array of pointer (I created this level to ecapsulated the different child objects)
 Rebollo: The pointer has a pointer os Parent
 Rebollo: which has pointers of balls
 Rebollo: grass
 Rebollo: water
 Rebollo: hole
 Rebollo: Game&gt;Pointers of Parent &gt; Parent &gt; Balls/Holes/Grass
 Rebollo: The only way I could ass different type in same data scructure
 Rebollo: add*
 Manchi_o6o7: *arr = new int[10]; you make basically 10 spots in the memory or 40 bytes to store your values. arr is holding the first value and when you for example type arr[4] it means that you want the element which is 16 bytes from the starting element in the array
 Manchi_o6o7: if this makes sense to you
 Rebollo: YES
 Rebollo: nice
 Rebollo: what if i do like this?
 Rebollo: int *a = 10;
 Rebollo: it is 16 bytes only
 struct: that doesnt work
 Rebollo: what about 
 Rebollo: Ball *b = new Ball()
 struct: int* a = new int(10);cerr &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl;cerr &lt;&lt; *a &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: will print address then print 10
 struct: Ball *b = new Ball() works yes
 struct: Ball a = Ball();Ball *b = &amp;a;
 struct: and b will point to a
 struct: everything will change either on b or a will affect both
 struct: since its pointing to the address of a
 Rebollo: Why would I need to create another then
 Rebollo: if is exaclty the same
 Rebollo: Ball a = Ball();
 Rebollo: Now I want ot create a copy of a
 Rebollo: not a reference
 struct: because it wont copy
 struct: it will save the reference
 Rebollo: and if I need to copy?
 Rebollo: to create to separated object that the change wont affect each other
 struct: Ball *b = new Ball(a);
 struct: it will copy it
 Rebollo: I have to create a special contructor for this?
 Manchi_o6o7: this is a copy constructor
 struct: no
 struct: maybe if you have pointers inside of what you are copying, im not sure
 Manchi_o6o7: It depends if you need to make a deep copy
 Rebollo: ok
 Rebollo: why u have to use * in this case
 Rebollo: Ball *b = new Ball(a);
 Rebollo: And the argument must be a pointer?
 Rebollo: a argument
 Rebollo: "a"
 Manchi_o6o7: it can also be Ball b=*a;
 struct: because of new
 Manchi_o6o7: but it depends what you want from the "b"
 struct: it will store on the heap
 struct: You can also do
 struct: Ball b = a;
 struct: but it will be stored on the stack
 Rebollo: I have to check what is heap and stack but I will take it a homework
 Rebollo: dont worry
 Notter2: Hi
 Manchi_o6o7: try to learn from the basics
 Manchi_o6o7: Then everything will be easier
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/BAKKhfO">https://tech.io/snippet/BAKKhfO</a>
 struct: hi
 Notter2: Why can't I access CoC chats?
 Rebollo: When I use struct and when I use class?
 Rebollo: I see a lot of sample using struct
 Manchi_o6o7: Struct is more a C thing. In C++ you use classes.
 Manchi_o6o7: The default privacy in a struct is public, while in a class it is private
 Rebollo: cool
 Rebollo: I have seen guys instatiating pointers with void type
 Rebollo: but couldn´t use
 Manchi_o6o7: You can use a struct for example if you want to make a struct for a node inside a graph class
 Rebollo: And the same concept of pointers and etc?
 struct: pointer is the same thing as a class
 struct: but class is private by default and struct is public
 Rebollo: I see
 GBDev13: hi!
 struct: hi
 struct: i didnt meant pointer, i meant struct :p
 WalkersApple: When the booleans are sus: :P
 FORMS1: Did anyone find a way to do the ASCII Art puzzle without manually assigning each letter?
 Husoski: FORMS1 Huh?  The raster map is given at the end of the input.  There's no need to "manually" do anything.  Just read it in and organize it.  What sort of "manually" did you have in mind?
 Rebollo: Guys, everytime I need to get a single character from a string like this stringSample[0], it necessarily return a char?
 Husoski: I did manually type in the string version of the characters, 'ABCD...XYZ?', but that was easier than, generating the range from ord('A') to ord ('z') and tacking on a&#160;? at the end.[*range(65,91),
 Rebollo: It alway a mess to convert to String again
 Rebollo: if is a number return wrong results
 Husoski: Rebollo what language?
 Rebollo: c++
 Rebollo: I hate char
 Rebollo: :yum:
 Husoski: yes, it's a char in C++
 Rebollo: ok, how can I converto to a string wihthout messing yhe value
 Rebollo: like if it is a number
 Rebollo: '5'
 Rebollo: and I use
 Rebollo: std::to_string
 Rebollo: I got the wrong result
 Husoski: ...checking cppreference...
 struct: so you wan to convert '5' to 5?
 Rebollo: to "5"
 Rebollo: char to string
 Rebollo: to_string got different value
 Thorcode: what the difference between "5" and '5'
 struct: str += '5';
 struct: should work fine
 Husoski: you can use std::string(1,c) to make a single character string.
 Rebollo: thankl you guys
 Husoski: .,.or string(42,c) to make 42 copies of c in a single string
 Rebollo: nice to know
 Rebollo: thanks
 ninjadip: EFF YEAH 100% on mars lander level 2
 Husoski: struct good call.  I'd forgotten that string::operator+ can take a char.
 Rebollo: Is that one nice Nija?
 ninjadip: now i can go do my actual homework that i've been avoiding
 Rebollo: Which concepts to learn?
 ninjadip: this was a pain in the but
 Rebollo: lol
 ninjadip: one trig function to figure angle 
 Rebollo: trigonometry?
 ninjadip: it says i learned distances and trig
 Husoski: Lots of physics in Mars Landers
 ninjadip: lots
 Rebollo: nice
 ninjadip: but very cool to me cause i love space
 ninjadip: let's see, under 200 lines of code, c++. so not terrible. just a lot of conditions
 Rebollo: Have you seen a actual rocket landing back on earth exaclty in the target? I think  few months ago?
 ninjadip: for all the physics factoring
 ninjadip: if i'm going this fast but want to go to this way.. is a mountain coming up, do i have to wait to steer just to stay up? blah blah blah
 ninjadip: ok later everyone
 ninjadip: oh, i've seen some spaceX landings
 ninjadip: failed and succesful
 ninjadip: interesting
 Rebollo: yes but, there is no try and error
 Rebollo: you have one chance
 Rebollo: of course there are powerfull simulators but
 Rebollo: unimaginable the mind of this guys
 Rodrigo_the_coder: help

 Milanovich: Hey, i'm doing the weekly puzzle and i'm beating the Boss in the first league, when/how do i get promoted?
 MSmits: when you rank above the boss and your submit is done
 MSmits: (Test in arena makes a submission)
 Milanovich: BATTLES IN PROGRESS 49% ah so when this reaches 100%?
 MSmits: if you rank above boss then yes
 MSmits: if you win vs boss and lose vs other players, you migth fail
 Milanovich: Thanks alot&#160;:)
 MSmits: any time
 MSmits: btw, you say beating boss, but there are like 40 arenas
 MSmits: you speak as if there is 1&#160;:)
 Milanovich: Right, so i'm only beating the boss in the first arena xD
 MSmits: there is no first
 MSmits: thats just 1 of many
 MSmits: there is no order to them
 MSmits: unless you mean leagues within a single arena
 MSmits: mad pod racing has several
 MSmits: you could play a different game at any moment, you're just playing that one right now
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Milanovich: This is my first attempt at bot programming, ill take a look at that link to understand it a bit more. I thought each league had its own boss to beat or something.
 MSmits: it does
 MSmits: but there are many games
 MSmits: a new league is just the same game with more rules or better opponents
 Milanovich: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ad5feb5-ecb2-48f2-bda6-72766edfb5b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ad5feb5-ecb2-48f2-bda6-72766edfb5b1</a>
 Milanovich: I had a lower score than Boss 1 in the end haha, and i was so confident too. Anyway talk to you later
 MSmits: good luck, you'll get there
 MSmits: there is some randomness in submissions
 MSmits: having 50+% winrate vs boss means you will probably promote if you submit multiple times
 GamingGnawer: what is "best practice" for solwing harder puzzles or writing better bots , should I be developing in a standalone IDE with debugger and file-strucutres support and then only use the browser for verification?
 MSmits: definitely don't do all your coding here
 MSmits: I just use visual studio
 MSmits: others use more tools. Up to you
 MSmits: I don't bother with multiple files btw. I just work in a giant file for a bot. But some people do use separate file and join those files before sending to CG
 MSmits: I never used those tools so dont ask me about those&#160;:)
 GamingGnawer: ok, thanks!I just noticed there is an extension for syncing with external files, which should make the whoel thing easier!
 MSmits: yeah there is
 GamingGnawer: Can I also get the extension to download test-cases or do I have to implement them manually if I want to use debugger on them?

 DylanGTech: Ban hammer ü§î
 Luigis3: I was responding to what dydyxX_04 said 
 MSmits: Luigis3 I suspect we aren't to view this as a medical help channel
 Luigis3: Not too familiar with the rules but I apologize for what I said
 DylanGTech: On a whole different topic, I actually got curious today about how recursion could ever be more useful or efficient than a series of loops
 rashadsprings3: hello
 MSmits: DylanGTech i think that depends on the language
 MSmits: the way it handles the stack of function calls
 MSmits: functional  programming languages are better at this I believe
 DylanGTech: I found the Tree Traversal example of recursion, and I suddenly had like a flashback moment to when my college professor made me write tree traversal library in C with AND without recursion
 DylanGTech: It wa sa multi-week assignment thankfully
 MSmits: tree traversal is just very hard to do without recursion
 DylanGTech: It's a bummer because I have forgotten a LOT about trees since that time
 FaisalDev: HELLO 
 DylanGTech: Hi
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: :evergreen_tree:
 MSmits: :palm_tree:
 MSmits: mmh blaise, it looks a lot like your name is butthill now...
 DylanGTech: Back to what you were saying though MSmits, my understanding is that the languages that use recursion effectively just convert it into a loop when compiled, right? I can imagine interpreted languages struggle with this a lot more
 MSmits: the extra III is unflattering :P
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: :unamused:
 MSmits: DylanGTech i'm not sure exactly but functional programming is very different. 
 MSmits: if by a loop you mean repeated instruction then probably yes
 DylanGTech: Yes
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Not my fault if they prefer add loading yellow pie than space support in nicknames...
 MSmits: I agree that's not your fault
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Automaton2000! The Firefox console display a turtle next to codingame.com if you launch a network analysis! :rofl:
 Automaton2000: if you remember the name
 MSmits: turtle is a bad thing?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Bad? Just slooowwww... :turtle:
 MSmits: steady wins the race
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Don't think the fable's turtle was carrying half the js libraries and web trackers... :smirk:
 MSmits: no, but it uses shell scripting
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: :clown:
 MSmits: only in c++ can you overwrite an array with 4x the size of itself using memcpy and then only suffer a weird error output and still win a game 
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Of course.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: dbdr'll say "Use rust, it's mem safe :nerd:"
 MSmits: with rust I would have crashed
 MSmits: I won!
 AllYourTrees: did someone say rust
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: I'm not someone
 AllYourTrees: oh nm then

 DeathParadox: lol
 BBianca: hey
 BBianca: i m new here
 Martin17: Hi, welcome&#160;:)
 BBianca: :innocent:
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Hello new here.
 AntiSquid: we dont like new ppl go away new
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Evil mod! :scream:
 MSmits: I agree with buthill, that's evil
 AntiSquid: wasnt talking to bianca
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: it's not evil, it's exorcistic
 MSmits: is that a word?
 AntiSquid: sure
 MSmits: ok
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Yeah! CG Survey!
 AntiSquid: i just created it, but it's not uncommon in books to find newly made up words, so it's a legit word :P
 MSmits: it needs time before it's a legit word. you need to repeat it every day several times for 3 years or something
 MSmits: so get crackin'
 Wontonimo: hey new people :wave: 
 MSmits: hey Wontonimo
 MSmits: I've been beating your counting TTT bot with a silly bot that's kind of cheating
 Wontonimo: the people here are actually helpful if you ask questions directly (and don't ask for your code to be rewritten)
 Wontonimo: that's fun MSmits
 MSmits: for a little while I am moving on now
 MSmits: It's just mirroring your move until it solves the game, then it plays the solved moves
 Wontonimo: if it is the "mirror once winning" cheat, that's fine
 MSmits: not mirror once winning
 MSmits: mirror until solve
 Wontonimo: nice
 MSmits: I just solve a bit sooner I guess
 Wontonimo: that's actually not so bad
 MSmits: I use negamax + ab + TT + a weak form of move ordering
 Wontonimo: the first person leads the mirror, but the second player can diverge at any time for a win
 MSmits: I think it's possible to solve islands separately, but thats hard and i cant be bothered
 MSmits: Wontonimo actually no, player 1 can keep mirroring
 MSmits: he just mirrors the diverged moves
 MSmits: the only reason my solve sometimes wins is that not everyone mirrors, so it makes use of that
 Wontonimo: ah, so now p2 is leading the mirror, but it's off by one
 MSmits: yeah
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: so sad
 MSmits: yeah, it needs a fix
 Wontonimo: oh well
 MSmits: which is why i am stopping here
 Wontonimo: good call
 Wontonimo: i like the idea of just adding a few random initial moves or dead squares
 MSmits: bot cant lose, but it also cant climb very fast if it can only draw against the best players and against mirror-ers
 MSmits: yeah that should work
 MSmits: wafflez says it also works to use an odd size
 MSmits: and it may, but I am not 100% sure
 Wontonimo: i don't want to code dead squares, but i think dead squares is "more fair" than random moves
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: all you need is an assymetric map
 Wontonimo: it was fun for a while at least
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: all you need is love
 Wontonimo: oh, like a maze
 MSmits: indeed blaise
 Wontonimo: and water, food, and shelter
 MSmits: that follows automatically from love
 MSmits: people who love you will feed you
 Wontonimo: i don't know about you, but I don't trade love for those thing.  That occupation has a name
 MSmits: hey that's not what i meant :P
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: :thinking: business?
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: guaranteed person basic income is all you need
 Wontonimo: it also solves the love trade thing (mostly)
 MSmits: it's the perfect fix for unemployment
 MSmits: people will work part-time because of it and then everyone who wants a job has a job. Just gotta tune the right amount of the basic income
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Automaton2000 this chat turns red!
 Automaton2000: this is my first time doing it
 Wontonimo: :scream:
 ProMikeSundays: hi
 martinpapa69: Automaton2000==chat?
 Automaton2000: i don't like the coderpad news. i think it will be fun

 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Pretty lucid in fact...
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Anyway. New meeting report <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/h3SspHt">https://imgur.com/a/h3SspHt</a>
 jacek: post it in discord memes
 MSmits: where does the yellow pie appear?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Reload the page.
 jacek: MSmits has fast internet
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Me too but I still see it for 1 or 2 seconds
 MSmits: i saw it!
 MSmits: was very quick though
 MSmits: I think they should slow it down. I did not fully enjoy it
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Post it yourself jacek, discord is out of my circumscription.
 Wontonimo: i like the yellow loading pie
 MSmits: me too, but it's too fast
 Wontonimo: it's way better than the very slow yellow loading line at the top of the page
 MSmits: is that still there?
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: it's too thin
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: "If nobody can see the problem, there's no problem"
 MSmits: Wontonimo  
 Wontonimo: that's why some of the devs where I work make their application pages blank

 MSmits: you can see what the mirroring does
 Wontonimo: i know, mirroring is *the way to go* in this game
 MSmits: top 3 are prolly just good bots.
 Wontonimo: i just haven't done it
 MSmits: but if I had a better solver I'd beat them too
 MSmits: well i did beat nr 3
 Wontonimo: nr?
 MSmits: rank 3
 MSmits: got 1 win, rest draws
 MSmits: so he is not mirroring
 MSmits: neither is rank 1 and 2 i think
 MSmits: but my solver is not good enough to beat them. They play the best moves  at the end as well, so they just draw
 Wontonimo: yeah, my bot is total overkill for the low rank that it is.  My solver is being beaten by heuristic-only bots
 MSmits: ah yeah, i suppose you can get into wood 1 with just heuristics
 MSmits: i didnt manage too. I did another 500 line just to get into wood 1 :P
 P3N1SL0V3R: is there a way to change my nickname?
 MSmits: reminds me of when i solved the game to get from wood 2 to wood 1 in D&amp;B :P
 P3N1SL0V3R: I'm sitting in class and i dont want my teacher to see my user
 Wontonimo: i was very surprised.  the boss is a solver that plays many thousand full playouts&#160;:( , so obviously the way it is doing random playouts is shortsighted
 MSmits: yeah you can do it in profile options 
 P3N1SL0V3R: ok ty
 MSmits: ohh, so it's not a bad boss then
 MSmits: usually those bosses are just a random move, or a 1 line heuristic
 MSmits: btw I am a teacher and I already saw your user so
 Wontonimo: it is my bot, but obviously my bot needs serious work if it can be beaten with a fairly simple heuristic.  I just have no idea what that heuristic could be
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: :eggplant::heart:
 MSmits: me neither, i was just counting 3 in a rows depth 0 and it was not enough toget to wood 1
 MSmits: Btw. I solved 6x8 C4 earlier today. took less than 2 million nodes. But still working on 11x4 with over 30 million nodes searched
 MSmits: the width is so much more important than the height
 Wontonimo: hehe ... you are loving that game and your solver
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: solved this so far
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/RxtO0v4">https://imgur.com/a/RxtO0v4</a>
 Wontonimo: what have i done lately?  Not much.  I started to write a new contribution based on WFC (wave function collapse) for automatic content generation
 MSmits: sure.... solve one of the major problems in quantum physics and then use it to auto generate more cat memes
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75474b51e6b3186ea493a8467395fbbefad7">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75474b51e6b3186ea493a8467395fbbefad7</a>
 Wontonimo: it is based on this repo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse</a>
 MSmits: ohh thats not quantum physics
 Wontonimo: nope, it just borrows ideas from it
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: sounds really cool
 Wontonimo: for a pretty neat solver that propagates pattern probabilities
 Wontonimo: i've not figured out how to do it in a computationally efficient way
 Wontonimo: but i really haven't spent much time on it
 MSmits: well it's a nice project
 MSmits: I'm thinking about nine mens morris
 MSmits: it's finally out there
 MSmits: this is one i know i can solve easily with available hardware, but could still be hard to code
 MSmits: and making a good bot from that is not easy
 MSmits: but you can train a nn using only supervised learning which is cool
 Wontonimo: the paths remind me of pacman
 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Yet another yellow pie...
 jacek: :v
 Wontonimo: if you encode the paths and positions, then it is a 13x13 bitboard
 MSmits: you mean for nine mens morris Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: yes
 MSmits: I would only use 2x 32 bit for this
 Wontonimo: ah, i thought you could play all along the outside
 Wontonimo: *lag*
 MSmits: yeah laggy
 MSmits: it has  the most symmetry of any board game on CG afaik
 MSmits: square rotation/mirror = 8x
 MSmits: but because you can switch inner and outer ring it's 16x
 jacek: even more than Y?
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: and 9mm is apparently occupied by most french
 jacek: in the meantime, no one talks about puzzle of the week? :thinking:
 MSmits: yep more than Y
 MSmits: didnt see it
 MSmits: is it paper soccer?
 jacek: night of war
 jacek: paper soccer was during earlier contest :unamused:
 MSmits: ahh
 Wontonimo: that looks like a neat multi
 PluckyPenguin: how do i capture blocks in night of war? is it the ones i can walk to or is it the ones i attack and win?
 Illedan: When you walk on them
 PluckyPenguin: thanks&#160;:)
 jacek: i think euler had some issues with night of war, being it unbalanced
 PluckyPenguin: So if I need to walk on a tile to make it mine and there is someone 2 spaces away from me i want to attack, does that mean I will get 2 spaces or 1?
 Wontonimo: attacking doesn't move your piece
 Wontonimo: it just costs money and kills them
 PluckyPenguin: ah ok. there goes my "boost" idea lol
 MSmits: not the weirdest thing anyone has ever thought reading a CG ruleset
 MSmits: I remember thinking my sub could teleport to any part on the map by surfacing :P
 PluckyPenguin: speaking of weird things....
 PluckyPenguin: does anyone know of a vscode plugin that works with codingame? Not a huge fan of the web based IDE and i'm lazy....CTRL+C - CTRL+V is too many keystrokes
 MSmits: sorry cant help you there. I am pretty lazy but not that lazy :P
 zero_one: a while ago I had a userscript which synced a local file into the IDE
 MSmits: i just do the copy paste from visual studio
 Wontonimo: spending 2 days finding, building, installing, and debugging a plugin to save 2 key strokes ... only a programmer would do
 PluckyPenguin: lol fair enough i'll stop being so lazy :P
 MSmits: well there's ways to do these things PluckyPenguin, i just dont know them
 PluckyPenguin: maybe i could even write my own...have to learn the basic hello-world equivalent of a plugin first
 zero_one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441</a>
 zero_one: haven't tried it, but sounds promising
 MSmits: i dont think that works
 MSmits: very old
 MSmits: but you can take the code and adapt it maybe
 PluckyPenguin: sounds like a massive detour this...i'll stick to the challenge for now but thanks all&#160;:)
 MSmits: hf&#160;:)

 Larnth: Welcome, Memeskreet
 MSmits: then you know absolutely nothing about coding because it's easy&#160;:)
 Larnth: You're just like the rest of us.

 MSmits: I make 13 yr old kids draw pictures using code after a few hrs and no coding experience
 MSmits: for them, coding is easy
 jacek: talking about child labor ~

 banshiicodes: well, that thread made me feel inadequate
 MSmits: thread?
 MemeSkreet: What thread?
 MSmits: I think he failed at some needle stuff?
 MSmits: not sure what he means, but some general advice: If you've never coded before, this is not the place to start. You can come here probably after a week or so spending some hours learning the basics. Many websites for that
 MemeSkreet: What websites should I use?
 MSmits: I havent learned to code lately, but codecademy is "ok". code.org is supposedly better
 MemeSkreet: I'll go check them out. brb
 MSmits: I did the hour of code thing they have with some students. It's block code (not written code) , but it helps if you've never done it before
 MSmits: on code.org i mean
 MSmits: you wont get stuck at least
 MSmits: probably from there you can find other resources
 MSmits: you should not have to pay anywhere i think. Enough free stuff
 jacek: exactly
 jacek: dont pay for papers either

 MaxIta: Hi*
 jacek: MSmits dont all games have 1 second start?
 MSmits: not sure
 MSmits: PluckyPenguin I think it's not just a code golf puzzle, but also a normal puzzle
 MSmits: and that one may have hints
 PluckyPenguin: i've passed the normal puzzle version just going 2 copy my code to see if that works in this
 MSmits: it should
 MSmits: i just copied all my code to the golf puzzles when i saw that i could
 jacek: i did time.sleep(0.85) in first turn and it didnt timeout
 MSmits: ohh great thanks
 PluckyPenguin: yep that works...so my thought process is wrong. It was a good while ago since I passed the regular puzzle lol
 MSmits: code golf does that to you
 MSmits: it's intrinsically wrong
 jacek: oh my, i think i found solution to angle discontinuation input
 jacek: just make it 2 inputs - sin(angle), cos(angle) and theyll be smooth
 woful: :flag_al:
 MSmits: what did you use that for jacek?
 jacek: search race nn
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: where car angle 358 may become 10 but in reality its not much different
 Laatas: hello 
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: yeah using angles that way is not good
 MSmits: sin/cos seems better
 MSmits: surprised me for a second that you didnt run into this before, but i realized you mostly did boardgames
 jacek: i only did board games
 MSmits: oh so really the first then
 MSmits: cool
 jacek: also, this time i try ga/neuroevolution
 MSmits: sounds funky
 jacek: yeah, it works by just randomly tweaking weights, look at the red <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/p3jd28">https://streamable.com/p3jd28</a>
 jacek: of course so far its no match for good ol' GA, but im working on it
 MSmits: whats the black one?
 jacek: i dont remember, maybe 1st generation
 MSmits: i remember you had one that just turns one way
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/jvj37n">https://streamable.com/jvj37n</a>
 jacek: they like turning a lot
 MSmits: ah, dancing squares algorithm.
 jacek: rectangles*
 MSmits: couldn't tell, too fast
 BigBadBeast_4968: hi
 MSmits: hi beast
 Kiko44: hi mehdi 
 BigBadBeast_4968: hi Msmits
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: oh no Neo, did Agent Smith take your mouth away again?

 PluckyPenguin: Any PHP people around? How are people getting sub 100 submissions in code golf's? It takes a minimum 24 chars to read something in from stdin 
 jacek: tricks :v
 Westicles: python3 -c
 H00n: As soon as a clash starts, I hear the windows XP shutdown sound and my brain just shuts down... 
 Wontonimo: good, you have ascended.

 GamingGnawer: will night of war get more leagues?
 jacek: no, its community game
 jacek: no more than wood
 YCSVenom: how i can check my recent clashes 
 TenOldMen: click on the bell on the top right
 TenOldMen: notification
 YCSVenom: no i mean reread it
 Stephen10121: do you want to see a recent clash?
 marcelodelazari: do you guys think that practicing here is good for code interviews?
 zero_one: maybe, never had a interview where code was relevant
 CatboyCodes:  
 AnneNg01: lol i had a coding interview same like here. nailed it since it's relevant with what I did here but never got back from that company
 Wontonimo: you are still stuck there?  omg
 Wontonimo: while you are stuck there AnneNg01, do something more meaningful things like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 tiagopotencia: Hi, guys! Do you know a good challenge to practice big O notation?
 Jerrasterix: do you mean optimization
 Jerrasterix: you can't practice big O notation, Its a "notation"
 tiagopotencia: ok optimization
 tiagopotencia: But undestanding the Big O Notaion to know how complex an algorithm is
 Jerrasterix: That's something, we look at in every puzzle
 Jerrasterix: Most puzzles have separate test cases called crunch test for these

 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1st win <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/559129817">https://www.codingame.com/replay/559129817</a>
 nacho_cheesefries: woot woot, congrats @patrickmcginnisll
 eulerscheZahl: that's a nice game you are playing there&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and you won with 4 vs 1 dice
 HoangH7: Hello all
 HoangH7: Nice to meet you.
 Marchete: happy caturday
 field3: It was difficult to improve the 7 rules of dice wood1. Nice dice!:smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: that's what you get for using free assets&#160;:(
 smilee: twitch.tv/senamonry
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl what about a similar asset but without having depth in the white circles
 ZarthaxX: like the circles would be plain, to reduce the polygons used
 smilee: Anyone want to join me in clash of code?
 eulerscheZahl: now it's approved, i don't want to repair the dice layout anymore at this point
 <b>**eulerscheZahl hates changes after approval</b></p><p><img src="/a/63758603571200" /> ZarthaxX: aight
 ZarthaxX: F
 eulerscheZahl: did your gf finish the work now?
 ZarthaxX: she said that back then the amount of polygons was big, because that model requires it
 ZarthaxX: and she proposed changing the model a bit, so the circles dont waste so many polygons
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: smilee I don't think you posted a link to clash of code lol
 eulerscheZahl: but i like the effect&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: let's see if i get complaints about it
 ZarthaxX: she did the model you have rn, but stopped because it was too much already
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: just say if you want to change it in the future  then&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: tradeoff between nice optics and speed, always hard to make the cut
 ZarthaxX: very true.. i also like this one haha
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: maybe reducing the quaility of the circles circunfurence
 eulerscheZahl: and i just checked yesterday's chat logs
 eulerscheZahl: therealbeef: wow, just the front page of that game, with the example game is making my cpu go to 30% cpu utilisation, and staying there even though the animation stopped
 ZarthaxX: o.o
 eulerscheZahl: PatrickMcGinnisII: Dice Duel runs slow as hell on my pc
 ZarthaxX: WTF
 ZarthaxX: oh no
 ZarthaxX: that's bad
 eulerscheZahl: i think i have to change it :sob:
 smilee: Who wants to play clash of code with me?&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: damn that was fast
 ZarthaxX: and really sad
 VizGhar: smilee -&gt; #clash
 smilee: Thanks!
 field3: I like the game system better.Approval Should I have been a little discouraged, I'm sorry.:disappointed_relieved:
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean you like the wood2 rules more than wod1?
 ZarthaxX: where did you get the model frm toad?
 ZarthaxX: my gf wants to check it
 eulerscheZahl: linked in the statement
 ZarthaxX: ah sorry lol
 ZarthaxX: ty
 eulerscheZahl: i modified it a bit, see my github
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/assets">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/assets</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's my version with reduced polygons already
 eulerscheZahl: i also have it as a be
 eulerscheZahl: blender file if needed
 ZarthaxX: oh okey
 ZarthaxX: thanks for that 
 ZarthaxX: will show her
 field3: I feel that wood2 can be left as it is.The rule bug removal of wood1 did not proceed easily.When I approved it, I didn't realize that wood1 had replaced the rules.
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl are blue and red theassets?
 eulerscheZahl: i added this extra rule as I was worried about a dumb strategy of making every dice to a 5 or 6
 eulerscheZahl: and then lots of 1 vs 1 exchanges
 eulerscheZahl: yes ZarthaxX
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i had problems with the color. some other models I tried were find in blender but just black when importing in threejs
 eulerscheZahl: and somehow when i import the model that works fine on CG at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://threejs.org/editor/">https://threejs.org/editor/</a> it's all black again
 ZarthaxX: weird :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: inconsistent
 eulerscheZahl: same three.js library
 ZarthaxX: my gf says the textures might have been imported for some render engine
 ZarthaxX: and three.js may not be compatible
 ZarthaxX: but still weird
 eulerscheZahl: a nightmare for someone like me who has no clue what he's doing
 eulerscheZahl: tested like 10 assets until i got 1 working with color
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 ZarthaxX: sounds painful
 eulerscheZahl: and got a few blender crashes when i took the red to create a blue one
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: so hard that i had to restart the entire computer
 ZarthaxX:&#160;?????????
 ZarthaxX: the f
 VizGhar: I though blender is standard
 VizGhar: not expecting crashes :P
 ZarthaxX: anyway, do you want a model with textures or without them, to see how it could be optimized for now
 eulerscheZahl: textures? help, i need a glossary
 ZarthaxX: the colors in this case
 ZarthaxX: if you prefer looking up a model without colors, to check if it suits you
 eulerscheZahl: the pre-set colors made it simple for me
 eulerscheZahl: have a look at the board in contrast: it has a 3D file and a 2D image on top. I had to modify the library code to get the picture loaded (CG changes URLs on upload)
 eulerscheZahl: so i hardcoded that path somewhere deep inside the lib
 ZarthaxX: mmh okey
 eulerscheZahl: if (url == "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn-games.codingame.com/community/1500515-1615736605574/board.jpg">https://cdn-games.codingame.com/community/1500515-1615736605574/board.jpg</a>") {
 ZarthaxX: im confused by the preset colors yet
 eulerscheZahl: it's material properties
 ZarthaxX: and the other thing , sounds like an annoying workaround
 eulerscheZahl: die = material A with property red
 eulerscheZahl: hole = material B with white
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: so the 2d image is mounted on the 3d board
 CodeDecodeDev: Hey
 eulerscheZahl: have a close look at the edges of the board
 CodeDecodeDev: Oh hi zarthaxX we meet again xD
 ZarthaxX: hey!
 eulerscheZahl: you can see the rows and columns again on the sides
 Voudrais: yo whats up
 CodeDecodeDev: so hows it going everyone
 ZarthaxX: oh it's wrapped in the 3d
 ZarthaxX: so its the material
 eulerscheZahl: material is jus assigned at the places where it needs to be
 eulerscheZahl: the picture thing is weird. desired for the player avatars
 eulerscheZahl: just weird for the board
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 ZarthaxX: i found those player boxes weird
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't sure how to make clear which player is which
 Voudrais: how are you?
 eulerscheZahl: could have tried some static side menu and less 3D area
 ZarthaxX: nah i liked that idea
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: i will go to bed now, too late
 eulerscheZahl: if i were you, i would be close to waking up again :D
 ZarthaxX: but if you want to discuss this some day tell me
 ZarthaxX: my gf can try doing a model without colors just to see if it fits your preferences :P
 ZarthaxX: i know, but you wake up WAAAY too early
 ZarthaxX: i wake up at 9
 ZarthaxX: just once at 7 30  :P
 eulerscheZahl: you don't get much sleep then
 ZarthaxX: i will prob sleep up to 10, but yeah, normally 7-6
 ZarthaxX: anyway gn&#160;:*

 Golden_Pheonix: for example:
 Golden_Pheonix: if input is "a"
 Golden_Pheonix: i want to print the output "apple"
 demnaty: you want to print for debugging
 demnaty: or just simple print
 Golden_Pheonix: now, i want to write the test case to check whether the printed text is "apple"
 Golden_Pheonix: simple print

 CrealStudio: why did u switch
 CrealStudio: from lua
 jacek: where lua is used seriously?
 CrealStudio: umm
 CrealStudio: do u know roblox or core
 CrealStudio: and itch.io was made with lua btw
 jacek: oh!
 CrealStudio: it also has a famous 2d game framework called love2d
 CrealStudio: and its easy to use once you learn it
 Riku5720: can someone explain something
 VizGhar: Riku5720 dont ask to ask... just ask

 Riku5720: oh
 Riku5720: n=int(input())print(str(n) * n)
 Riku5720: I also did
 Riku5720: n=int(input())print(str(n) * n - 1) and that just breaks it
 Riku5720: with an input of 2 I expect 22 but I get 222
 Riku5720: 3 = 333 but I get 3333, etc
 jacek: really? it should work normally
 JFB: str(n) * n&#160;???
 JFB: in what language? In Python iit is multiplication of string and intiger
 Riku5720: python
 jacek: "3" * 3 will give "333"
 Riku5720: I just tried it myself and got 1, 22, 333
 Riku5720: but on here it doesnt
 Riku5720: it gives me 11, 222, 3333
 jacek: no hidden print eh?
 jacek: paste the all code
 Riku5720: n=int(input())print(str(n) * n)

 Riku5720: and it works regular in here
 Riku5720: 1, 22, 333 here
 Riku5720: but 11, 222, 3333 on the other one
 Riku5720: maybe the input is done differently? same exact code

 MSmits: hey jacek, i did a simple toy experiment with xor just now. Trying to teach  a NN to do xor with two types. negative xor and positive xor. Doing it with a two-hot version and a version where input can be -1, 0 or 1
 MSmits: in this case it seems better to concentrate the input somehow
 MSmits: inputs = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [-1,-1], [-1,0], [0,-1]]targets = [0,1,1,0,0,1,1]
 MSmits: this
 MSmits: vs
 MSmits: inputs = [[0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,0], [1,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,1,1]]targets = [0,1,1,0,0,1,1]
 MSmits: first version works better it seems
 MSmits: cant draw any conclusions from this, but was fun experiment
 MSmits: I used a single hidden layer. Basically the typical xor example slightly altered
 VizGhar: It's swarming with NN since contest :D
 Smelty: yes
 MSmits: in my case has nothing to do with contest really, but you're right
 ZarthaxX: annoying :P
 VizGhar:&#160;:) I'm curious, when my time will come to try NNs
 VizGhar: 3.5 very hard puzzles remaining, then I'll go after bot contests
 ZarthaxX: :O
 MSmits: you misspelled that, it's "fun" ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: nice
 ZarthaxX: *fun* as the one you have in a contest
 ZarthaxX: where you struggle at the very end to stay high :P
 MSmits: nah this is more fun&#160;:)
 MSmits: relaxed, work without time limit
 jacek: fun, or competetive
 jacek: mutual exclusive
 MSmits: well competitive can be fun, but i like it better in multi arena where i am not stressed to do everything within 11 days
 therealbeef: that's personal preference I think
 MSmits: sure
 therealbeef: for me, the stress and competition makes it more fun
 MSmits: yeah, you're not alone in that

 zonbita: when is supporter online?
 struct: tech support?
 zonbita: yes

 MSmits: well there is a tech support forum thingy isnt there?
 zonbita: i see a problem about calculator declare main, class with c#
 therealbeef: zonbita, the input and output are connected, you just have to find it
 MSmits: you dont need tech support i bet zonbita, you need debugging for your code
 zonbita: not mistake for me
 MSmits: how do you know
 zonbita: using library and main, class

 Smelty: lolol
 zonbita: i want use c# for recruitment
 Smelty: its fine
 Greg_3141: unless you're playing code golf it doesn't matter how many characters the code has
 Smelty: i use python for shortest

 Smelty: but they shouldn't care about which language they use in code gold cuz its for shortest
 Smelty: *golfand i op
 Greg_3141: code golf is more of a hobby than a useful programming skill imo
 Smelty: yes
 MSmits: yeah nothing useful about it
 Smelty: when i code gold with java, it looks horrifying
 Smelty: one extremely long line of code containing everything
 MSmits: unless maybe you want to put more weights in your nn and want to code to take up as little as possible&#160;:)
 Greg_3141: what does that have to do with anything? You're not going to golf away the space required to store the weights
 MSmits: eh part of the space, why not
 MSmits: you have 100k characters more or less
 MSmits: if your code is smaller, you can squeeze in a few more weights, if you even need them ofc
 Greg_3141: because then the code quickly becomes unreadable if you golf the parts that can be golfed?
 MSmits: you code locally in uncompressed form
 MSmits: then convert it before you put it in IDE
 MSmits: it'd be nice if you know how to make it as small as possible
 MSmits: it's a kind of golfing
 MSmits: not the same as coc ofc
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: i first code it then golf it
 Greg_3141: how are you gonna compress storing several 2D arrays anyway? Because that's how NN weights should be stored
 struct: this is readable right? p eval`dd`.scan(/\d+/)*?+
 MSmits: like a monster string Greg_3141
 MSmits: you have a function that turns it into 2d arrays in the first 1 second of the game

 Greg_3141: ok but why though? You're going to save very few characters (if any at all) vs just having it in a 2d array to begin with
 MSmits: because of codespace
 MSmits: you can have 100k characters
 MSmits: if you put a bunch of floats in there, they are going to be several characters each
 MSmits: not to mention commas to separate in the array
 MSmits: I think jacek uses 1 character per weight in his NN's 
 MSmits: thats a lot better than the 6 or 7 you would have in your 2d situation
 MSmits: imagine a very long string with mostly Chinese characters
 Greg_3141: makes sense ig for some languages
 MSmits: each character holding roughly 16 bit, for a 16 bit float
 MSmits: any language actually
 MSmits: if you want to store something efficiently in small codespace
 Smelty: Hydrazer wait a sec
 MSmits: Greg_3141 this is part of my endgame book in Bandas: wstring book = L"겆푪䟨킎췎ᇘ㘰"
 zonbita: wtf _Royale know all language 
 MSmits: each character holds 10 results (win/loss/draw) for a particular board configuration
 MSmits: so 10 results in 1 character
 MSmits: thats powerful
 Greg_3141: makes sense, thanks
 MSmits: np
 Riku5720: hello
 jacek: Automaton2000 where is your book
 Automaton2000: way easier to get the same score
 Smelty: lmao i got temperature code gold solved in 273 with  java
 Smelty: *golf
 Smelty: Hydrazer
 jacek: 273?
 jacek: thats absolute unit
 Smelty: huh coincidence
 jacek: is it?
 Smelty: well i removed everything i could and thats what i got
 Smelty: either that or its a blessing from the lord
 Smelty: import java.util.*;class Solution{public static void main(String args[]){Scanner j=new Scanner(System.in);int n=j.nextInt();int h=6000;for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++){int t=j.nextInt();if(Math.abs(h)&gt;Math.abs(t)){h=t;}if(h==-t){if(t&gt;0){h=t;}}}if(h==6000){h=0;}System.out.println(h);}}

 Smelty: ok there
 Smelty: ummuhherrrr
 jacek: huh
 Greg_3141: You might be able to make it shorter with functional features in Java
 struct: o.o
 Hydrazer: eeeeee
 MSmits: in python you can do 6*"e"
 struct: 6*?e in ruby
 MSmits: whats the "?"
 struct: idk but it works
 MSmits: ruby is weird
 jacek: my code summed up
 MSmits: you code ruby?
 jacek: "idk but it worksdk but it works
 MSmits: oh right, you dont know why yours works
 jacek: meh
 jacek: can type today
 jacek: t
 MSmits: it's ok, I got it
 struct: ok it was ?e*6
 struct: my ruby skills are gonne
 Smelty: i cant get my code to under 200 in don't panic&#160;:(
 jacek: dont panic, youll get there
 Smelty: sniffles
 Smelty: im at 235
 MSmits: it's hard
 jacek: use something else than java
 Smelty: im not using java
 Smelty: im using python
 Hydrazer: use cobol
 jrke: which multi/
 jrke:&#160;?
 jrke: *
 casmith789: I just got to 200 in c++. feeling good until I see other people at 76 chars in c++
 Smelty: confusion
 struct: 76 is probably just system calls
 MSmits: bash solution?
 struct: yes or perl/ruby
 Smelty: ok ill try 
 Smelty: *opens ruby*length: 1200
 MSmits: first you need to make sure you exhausted all logic improvements
 Smelty: hm
 MSmits: sometimes you're keeping track of things you dont need to
 struct: in your java solutions i saw some obvious reductions
 Smelty: lol i just randomly typed up stuff
 Smelty: also 237 was a nice number
 Hydrazer: obviously
 MSmits: I think it's an ok number
 Greg_3141: you could get rid of some brackets, just realized that
 struct: brackets abs for loop
 thomasgonda3: are achievements supposed to unlock immediately when you do one
 struct: sometimes it takes a while to trigger
 thomasgonda3: i got 2200 on mars lander 2 optimization and it still hasnt given me the less than 400L on 5th test achievement
 thomasgonda3: i dont think its possible to get 200 and not have the 5th test be over 400
 thomasgonda3: 2200
 struct: i think its possible to check the score you got on the testcase
 struct: validator*
 struct: ah im wrong
 Smelty: well
 Smelty: Hydrazer if you invite me to another clash i'll join
 Hydrazer: ok im almost done
 Smelty: k
 Smelty: reee my code golf still at 230
 thomasgonda3: ok nvm i figured it out, mars lander optimization and mars lander episode 2 are actually different things
 thomasgonda3: even though theyre the same tests
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: relu works quite wel on xor
 MSmits: (for first layer)
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: i had some trouble first, because your xor example does sigmoid before sigmoid_prime as well, but you cant do that with relu
 MSmits: so have to be careful converting code
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: def relu(x): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/691c233f-3950-43bd-b58d-0165785a2423">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/691c233f-3950-43bd-b58d-0165785a2423</a>
 MSmits: def sig(x): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d405db34-8677-45c1-808c-c818273a430d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d405db34-8677-45c1-808c-c818273a430d</a>
 MSmits: node the "already sigmoided"
 MSmits: note
 jacek: oh
 jacek: you can put already "relued x" it would be the same
 MSmits: hmm, yeah i guess the &gt; 0 would still work
 MSmits: good point
 MSmits: dunno why i thought it wouldnt
 MSmits: i think my next test, i will try a one hot TTT vs a -1, 0, 1 TTT
 MSmits: can just generate all states and train on that right?
 struct: whats a -1, 0, 1 ttt?
 MSmits: input
 MSmits: -1 = 0, 0 = empty, 1 = cross
 MSmits: first 0 = O
 MSmits: you can also have  a one-hot version
 MSmits: with 3 inputs per cell
 MSmits: for a total of 27
 MSmits: so that would be 0,0,1 or 0,1,0
 MSmits: or 1,0, 0
 struct: I see
 struct: 3*9 possible cells
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: thats how its done on CG generally, as i understand
 struct: 3 possible inputs for each
 MSmits: yes
 Smelty: yes
 jacek:  
 Smelty:  
 jacek: welp the way i do usually that would be 6 inputs for each
 MSmits: because of who's turn it is?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: you could also just have a single input that's on or off cant you?
 struct: how does it make it 6 with turn?
 MSmits: well, you have 0,0,1,0,0,0 or 0,0,0,0,0,1
 MSmits: same state, different players turn
 jacek: you can have separate input for turn, yes
 MSmits: I prefer the flipping thing personally. It feels so bloated to have twice as many inputs. Might be irrational of me
 jacek: but that would require more hidden units/layers to figure out that side to move changes things, especially in zugzwangish games
 boiifyoudont: hello
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: i think in oware flipping would work alright
 struct: ah so you have 6 inputs 3 for each player?
 MSmits: ttt might be different here, because the two players play a totally different game
 jacek: i might test flipping vs doubling. if it works i may double the hidden units for better predictions
 MSmits: why not double it anyways?
 jacek: size limit
 jacek: :unamused:
 MSmits: oh, but you have two layers of weights dont you?
 Ahmedk-n: free_palastine
 MSmits: affected
 jacek: yes. and i have only 1 hidden layer
 jacek: so double the weights effectively
 MSmits: so from hidden to output stays the same with flipping, right?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: is this a much smaller set of weights?
 MSmits: oh right, you have very little output
 MSmits: so i guess thats the case
 MSmits: yeah, you definitely need to flip
 MSmits: i am 95% sure of this&#160;:)
 MSmits: but already rank 1... maybe you need to wait till robo does some new magic
 jacek: no motivation though
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: i think this is a small change in the running of the bot. But you would need to retrain the bot and such. 
 jacek: but double hidden units means half speed, additional accuracy may not be worth it
 MSmits: yes, but even if you dont double, you're doing less calculation arent you?
 MSmits: it might just speed up the bot
 jacek: calculations would be the same?
 boiifyoudont: .
 MSmits: oh right, because of the zeroes
 Smelty: lol
 MSmits: Robo explained this
 jacek: hello
 MSmits: well there is cache efficiency
 MSmits: probably small gain there, but still
 MSmits: it's funny, if i do the xor maybe 10 times with different random seeds, 1 time it will get stuck at 0,20 cost. That's a local minimum right?
 MSmits: so it needs one of them tricks to avoid that
 jacek: depending on random weights it may never converge
 jacek: like all the outputs would be 0.6666
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: do you ever run into that problem, or are there just so many weights that its never a problem?/
 MSmits: the xor example is small
 jacek: i only ran into it for xor problem
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: especially with 2 or 3 hidden units
 MSmits: yeah that makes it worse
 MSmits: mmh should i do the TTT in python or c++. I am not sure which would be best
 MSmits: i will eventually be training with python
 MSmits: but will be running on CG with C++
 jacek: why does it matter. it is easily translatable
 MSmits: meh 
 MSmits: you're right
 MSmits: I will do python, make a trinket out of it on trinket.io. Can add some graphics and share more easily
 jrke: so after many months i went back to D&amp;B :smiley:
 jacek: :scream:
 jrke: and discovered my current code in IDE is endgame solver with no bugs but can't solve a game having more than 15 chains under 100 ms
 MSmits: yeah jrke i remember that
 MSmits: it's quite hard to do an endgame solver that does all endgame boards within 100 ms
 MSmits: (per board i mean)
 MSmits: mine can do all but 1 in a million I think
 MSmits: some are extremely complex
 jrke: and i also remember that you can solve one game under 2-3 ms for majority games
 jrke: right?
 MSmits: yeah more or less
 MSmits: and someone discovered a rare bug in the solver. I think it was you
 MSmits: didnt fix that yet
 jrke: yeah that was me
 MSmits: too busy with other stuff
 MSmits: thanks again for that, it's the best thing people can do for you on CG
 MSmits: help you spot bugs
 jrke: and also helping in fixing them
 MSmits: well that too
 MSmits: my solver is a beast though, no idea where to look. I will check it out when i get back to it and try some more approaches. It's so much weaker than the nr 1 bot
 Smelty: Hmmm
 MSmits: nr 1 bot plays the nim game better
 MSmits: for now, i am focused on NN for a few months at least, maybe longer
 jrke: yeah NN is best thing to learn 
 MSmits: it's fascinating. It does close some doors though. Sometimes I like writing a bot because it requires me to get into a game and understand it
 jrke: btw i have an issue with my first NN code 
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68de9c47-d163-43da-b18a-6321acc84f76">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68de9c47-d163-43da-b18a-6321acc84f76</a>
 jrke: when i set lr = 1
 jrke: then weights gets to 'inf' then 'nan'
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: I see no activation function
 jrke: yeah i removed that
 jrke: cause its for sum
 jrke: input 7,3 output = 10
 jrke: weights get exactly near to 1,1,0
 jrke: so a*1+b*1+bias*0=a+b
 MSmits: oh, this is a sum NN
 jrke: yes
 MSmits: how does it learn?/
 herrmann: You're diverging, probaby because  the lr is too high
 herrmann: Then your weights will grow a lot over time and go to inf
 jrke: maybe the problem comes in 0,0,0
 MSmits: not really
 MSmits: that's ignored basically
 MSmits: because any weight will be correct
 herrmann: Make the lr something like 0.01 and give it a try
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: you learn with a fraction of the error
 MSmits: thats not backpropagation is it?
 jrke: yup its error learning
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: not gradient descent then.
 herrmann: It's still backprop, but with non-exploding updates
 MSmits: I dont know how well this is supposed to work
 jrke: this works good in lr=.1
 herrmann: The best way to find a good starting learning rate for non-adaptive SGDs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sgugger.github.io/how-do-you-find-a-good-learning-rate.html">https://sgugger.github.io/how-do-you-find-a-good-learning-rate.html</a>

 jacek: too big near 1 lr would explode
 MSmits: learning rate seems the perfect parameter to just binary search
 MSmits: just try a few until you found the best one
 MSmits: keep it small at first, because that would just make it learn slow, instead of exploding like jacek says
 jrke: hmm
 herrmann: There are optimizers like Adam which adapt the lr along the way
 jacek: i mean this big lr could lead into inf or nan issues
 herrmann: And in practice keep a lr per weight
 MSmits: I did 0,5 LR for hexapawn :P
 jacek: im simple man, i use just minibatch SGD + momentum and it works
 MSmits: worked fine, but then again that was Q-learning and player 2 always wins
 jrke: hmm great now i have an idea why it gets 'inf' or 'nan'
 jrke: time to sleep
 jrke: gn
 herrmann: You don't need to binary search for a good lr... usually staring with a good one and having a low-high-low schedule during training goes a long way
 MSmits: SGD + momentum, whats that?
 MSmits: gn jrke
 herrmann: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/lr-scheduler.html">https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/lr-scheduler.html</a>
 jacek: stochastic gradient descent, the same in that xor example
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/batch-mini-batch-stochastic-gradient-descent-7a62ecba642a">https://towardsdatascience.com/batch-mini-batch-stochastic-gradient-descent-7a62ecba642a</a>
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: and you have momentum the same size of your weights, and you update momentum first, it really speeds up the traininng
 MSmits: i'm not sure what momentum is in this context
 herrmann: Like "inertia" for updates
 herrmann: To skip local bumps in the loss surface
 herrmann: And Adam is SGD with adaptive momentum
 jacek: i may write the example right away
 herrmann: There, giving away all the advantages I'd have in these challenges :joy:
 MSmits: mmh, I have a feeling the best NN guys know this stuff already herrmann&#160;:)
 herrmann: Definitely
 MSmits: I know :poop:  though keep it coming
 herrmann: A friend (BrunoFelthes) introduced me to this platform and immediately asked "why don't people just go full AlphaZero?"
 herrmann: Then "TotoZero" just appeared
 Smelty: Hydrazer im coding rn next time ok
 Hydrazer: ok
 herrmann: (*I immediately asked)
 Smelty: lol
 MSmits: herrmann azero has been done in oware over a year ago
 MSmits: toto is not the first
 MSmits: I think Robo was first with it
 jacek: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/fsNq5F78">https://pastebin.com/fsNq5F78</a>
 jacek: compare it with previous xor example and see how faster cost drops
 MSmits: yay another one&#160;:)
 MSmits: i'll check it out now
 MSmits: yeah drops faster
 MSmits: gonna go text compare to see whats different
 MSmits: I see mo's and mom's
 jacek: mom is lambda, mometum parameter generally in range [0.8,0.99]
 MSmits: that's not a large range
 jacek: herrmann and people would not go 'full alphazero' due to size limit and/or cpu limit
 MSmits: which is why nn were late to arrive here at all
 MSmits: let alone azero
 herrmann: Not with online training I mean
 MSmits: no even just running it, 100k characters is not much
 MSmits: but people got good at packing stuff
 herrmann: Just skimmed over reCurse's post-mortem, but in that sense
 herrmann: Of course, with some preparation up the sleeves
 MSmits: for a long time it was thought to be too hard to do NN here. Now, as reCurs e explains, you dont even need the full size
 AntiSquid: what is your background with ML herrmann?
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e3c0d03-35bb-4dc5-8d3d-947053387102">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e3c0d03-35bb-4dc5-8d3d-947053387102</a>
 Smelty: oop
 dbdr: recurs also said that contest was ideal, won't always be the case
 Marchete: I still don't see the "easy" to pack
 herrmann: I did research in Automated Planning, but nowadays I work with deep learning models and applied AI
 Marchete: any little NN takes 80KB to me
 AntiSquid: cool stuff HemersonTacon
 MSmits: you can put a weight in a single character Marchete
 AntiSquid: herrmann (mister man lol) 
 Marchete: float16 and then unicode?
 herrmann: There are Planning competitions too, where *the game*  is given as input
 jacek: you need a diet to lower the weights
 Marchete: that'd be 22KB
 MSmits: Marchete yeah more or less, i did not do this myself, but i packed other stuff, like endgame books
 Marchete: but you lose quality too
 kovi: yep, for multiplayer boardgames its "easy" nowbut contests has more complex rules, and only 10 days
 MSmits: those are integer based
 jacek: a little less than 16 bits is more than enough
 Marchete: one-hot takes a lot of space
 MSmits: people forget though, that you dont need to use a NN to play a full game
 Marchete: oware with just a Dense 64 -&gt; 22k parameters
 MSmits: even if the game is too complex to make a NN for, just do it partially
 Marchete: wth
 herrmann: @AntiSquid yes, ancestral family immigration typo probably :joy:
 Marchete: I know you can just simulate the eval
 MSmits: playing locam? Make a NN to draw cards&#160;:)
 kovi: msmits, yes...but than you need to spend the same time to solve a pct of the whole problem/space
 Marchete: he counts with endgame and such
 Marchete: I guess
 MSmits: i dunno about time, a smaller problem is easier to fix than a larger one. But NN is gonna take a shtload of time anyways, i would not dare try it in a contest
 kovi: for locam we did transfer learning&#160;:)
 herrmann: Speaking of Planning and how UCT comes up a lot here, I think a lot of you will appreciate this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2900929.2900981">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2900929.2900981</a>
 MSmits: kovi is that stealing someone else's draw order?
 MSmits: because, then... yes&#160;:)
 Marchete: transfer learning :D
 jacek: umm
 AntiSquid: spot on
 reCurse: Transfer learning :lmao:
 reCurse: Good one
 herrmann: (I was at the conference that year and must say Kolobov was speechless at how his highly tuned LRTDP lost to a (also tuned) UCT)
 kovi: actually i did my own training...before and after closet...(not nn)
 Marchete: I don't know what LRTDP is
 MSmits: no idea what LRTDP is
 Marchete: also I don't trust most papers
 jacek: do you trust rocks more
 herrmann: Trust this one
 reCurse: Imitation learning might have been more correct :thinking:
 AntiSquid: herrmann that link says UCT won, why should we care about LRTDP&#160;?
 dbdr: herrmann if LRTDP is iterative deepening, it means you need an eval?
 AntiSquid: while a UCT-based planner, PROST, won the contest, an LRTDP-based system, GLUTTON, came in a close second
 AntiSquid: -quote
 herrmann: LRDTP in finite horizon problems propagates the reward from the end to the initial state
 MSmits: dbdr many mcts variants use eval, when the depth is too great
 MSmits: perhaps this lrtdp is better at this
 dbdr: sure
 herrmann: (GLUTTON was his tuned LRTDP)
 jacek: where do I pay to get the paper? asking for a friend
 reCurse: scihub
 herrmann: @dbdr if the state space has loops, LRTDP will keep doing Bellman backups and things converge
 MSmits: so, for example oware?
 MSmits: though in practice loops take too many turns
 MSmits: checkers better
 MSmits: very short loops
 herrmann: Let me check what oware is about
 Lysk: jacek <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/ai/pubs/kolobov-aaai12.pdf">http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/ai/pubs/kolobov-aaai12.pdf</a>
 AntiSquid: i already found the paper for free and doanloded , no weird websites either jacek
 reCurse: Whatever you do don't pay the publishers :P Authors get nothing
 jacek: phew. who would in their right mind pay for papers
 struct: the link he posted had access to pdf
 MSmits: :rage:
 struct: you only had to click on "publisher site"
 MSmits: one time!
 AntiSquid: just get unpaywall extension it often finds for you official legal free alternatives so ...
 herrmann: Oh, sorry, didn't see the paywall, but it's probably available somewhere else
 AntiSquid: i guess some publishers want to make money from free stuff
 MSmits: was just linked herrmann
 herrmann: Don t pay! :upside_down:
 herrmann: But in short: this is for probabilistic domains and from what I've seen most games here have deterministic actions, so, not that immediately applicable
 MSmits: ah right
 herrmann: But just to illustrate how a simple UCT can go a long way too
 jacek: well simulatonous games could be 'probabilistic'
 MSmits: well we have thousands of bots here using it&#160;:)
 jacek: yeah UCT has many more applications than games
 HemersonTacon: cool stuff where?!  AntiSquad :grin:
 herrmann: Yes, but with unknown opponent policies
 MSmits: squid
 MSmits: he's not a squad
 Lysk: pro squad but anti squid
 AntiSquid: spell it correctly if you want to ping :P
 AntiSquid: well if it's probabilistic maybe it works for fog of war games herrmann
 MSmits: yeah

 MSmits: nice!
 reCurse: Hmm, I can't believe I'm asking this, but what's the best fog of war game
 herrmann: If it's a (PO)MDP
 reCurse: OOC?
 jacek: blind chess
 reCurse: On CG
 jacek: spring challenge with crashed viewer
 <b>**jacek leaves quietly</b></p><p><img src="/a/62842162200886" /> <b>**Smelty leaves quietly</b></p><p><img src="/a/63052365393434" /> jacek: pacman? wondev woman?
 MSmits: ooc is quite good. 
 MSmits: ooc is the only game where the fog is central to the game
 struct: ooc
 MSmits: in wondev woman it's mostly a gimmick
 MSmits: also in that crystal rush game
 reCurse: Oh crystal rush too
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Good picks
 herrmann: Fog of war is best modelled with partial observability, but keeping algorithms of this kind deciding good things in big state spaces under 100ms is a holy grail
 AntiSquid: pacman has fog
 MSmits: oh right pacman
 reCurse: Pacman looks like a bad game
 reCurse: Am I wrong
 struct: no
 reCurse: I skipped it almost instantly
 MSmits: if you want the fog to be important though, then ooc is by far the best
 AntiSquid: hanabi has fog, best game with fog
 aCat: yeah ooc best with imperfect info
 MSmits: reCurse pacman is ok if you're a new player and want to apply BFS and such
 reCurse: Yeah OOC looks cool
 jacek: and dont forget :notebook: :soccer:
 reCurse: I'm curious about handling fog of war in RL
 reCurse: Maybe I'll do that next
 Smelty: r
 jacek: :scream:
 YurkovAS: dbdr how many rollouts you have in 2nd turn? and you use duct?
 struct: will it work well on ooc?
 reCurse: No clue

 Smelty: what is an underrated bot programming cg game
 reCurse: Just food for thought
 MSmits: ooc is a weird game, like dots and boxes is weird. Doesnt fit in the usual categories. But that might be what you're looking for
 MSmits: clobber also seems interesting if you want more boardgames
 reCurse: I'm also still interested into UTTT to handle how to play when you're down
 MSmits: down?
 reCurse: The whole "you know you lost but how do you still try to win" dilemma
 MSmits: ohh that one
 jacek: the 1p advantage?
 reCurse: There has to be something
 jacek: its annoying
 MSmits: very annoying
 MSmits: I searched forever to find a route for p2 to win. It never seems to exist if you go back far enough
 AntiSquid: add steal move one first turn, that will fix it 
 reCurse: It's not really about fixing it
 MSmits: p2 to draw I mean
 reCurse: It's almost a philosophical problem
 reCurse: The better you are in an imbalanced game
 reCurse: The worst you play on the imbalanced side
 reCurse: It's puzzling
 jacek: all you can do is rank moves and choose the best even if all seem bad
 Illedan: Predict points or which time you lose instead of just winning or losing?
 reCurse: Time to lose doesn't mean it has more chance to win
 struct: create a NN for each side
 struct: ez fix
 reCurse: Think of those sacrifice pieces uselessly to delay mate in chess
 reCurse: Completely useless
 Illedan: true
 AntiSquid: if lose go for higher branching
 MSmits: with minimax and iterative deepening you can play the last best move that wasnt solved as loss, so 1 iteration before solve
 reCurse: AntiSquid you're on to something probably
 1415495: it depends on what you mean to win when you should lose, the only way I see is to modelize the limitation of the opponent and then try to exploit them
 jacek: delay the loss, you can always count the opponent will not see his win
 MSmits: ye thats what i meant jacek
 kovi: fireworks is weird because it is coop
 reCurse: Fenrir true, but let's assume you try to stay 'generalist'
 reCurse: There has to be a way to formulate "less chance to lose"
 reCurse: I get a bit of the same intuition as to why minimax solving performs better if you go for lower branching first
 MSmits: it might also depend on the game. if it is score based, it could be trying to get the highest net score. 
 reCurse: The something something number
 reCurse: Theorem
 MSmits: remember our discussion about seeds vs wins in oware
 1415495: I tend to think: you try to degrade the opponent (branching factor) or go above it's horizon planning
 MSmits: seeds would be better if you've lost
 reCurse: Branching sounds like a fantastic factor yes
 Lysk: maybe a regression head in the network trying to predict final score and use it when chance to win are all low
 reCurse: There are games without final score
 reCurse: Like uTTT
 reCurse: Doesn't help there
 MSmits: not really no, boards won is a bad estimator
 reCurse:  Or chess
 reCurse: etc

 Smelty: .
 jacek: hmm my learned n-tuple TTT bot wins more games against random bot than the perfect player. i think this is partly because the learned player maximize the traps set for the opponent
 jacek: while perfec players see only draws and choose randomly
 reCurse: That's part of the dilemma yes
 reCurse: There are limitations to perfect play performance
 reCurse: It's pretty interesting
 reCurse: I started a new training with bugfixes on UTTT, winrate is so abysmal for P2 it's probably worse in the arena for it
 1415495: maybe you want something that when lossing: try to choose the branch where a few mistake make you win, so training against an opponent that sometimes chose badly&#160;?
 jacek: dont worry, your bot loses as 1p as well
 reCurse: Weird flex but ok
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/559280196">https://www.codingame.com/replay/559280196</a>
 jacek: :grin:
 MSmits: btw, winrate difference p1 and p2 goes up with better bots
 jacek: just like chess. the white advantage is bigger with better players
 MSmits: with karliso it's over 90% when he plays vs himself i think
 MSmits: for me usually 70-80% at most
 1415495: this way: (with a few random bad moves): that create a value that it is not 100% loss, and with a higher and higher value for branch which require a more and more 'perfect' play
 reCurse: Hmm
 1415495: not sure I am clear
 reCurse: I get the idea not sure how to formulate it though
 MSmits: this is actually what mcts does with solver
 MSmits: with random rollouts
 MSmits: even though it's generally much worse, at least you have a score for lost nodes
 MSmits: so you can choose the least bad node when you solved a loss
 MSmits: also... I dont see the use in uttt reCurse, your NN solves quite late
 MSmits: so when you solve it, your opponent sure has
 reCurse: UTTT is the only game where I see real value in addressing that problem
 MSmits: maybe you dont mean actual solving, just a low NN value score
 reCurse: No I didn't mean solving
 reCurse: The better you are, the higher your&#160;% as P1
 MSmits: ah ok, then we're talking much earlier in the game
 reCurse: Which leaves almost no value to learn from P2
 reCurse: And little knowledge of how to play to swindle the opponent
 MSmits: You might consider starting the game with worse positions for p1 in training
 reCurse: That doesn't help though
 MSmits: i wouldnt know
 reCurse: The other idea I have is to give 5x more iterations to P2
 Lysk: would making opp values homogeneous on purpose (like the description of what was happening in silver) help?
 reCurse: Simulate an horizon
 MSmits: hmm who knows, might work
 reCurse: I don't know why, I hate uttt, I don't want to get back into it, but that problem fascinates me somehow
 MSmits: just be careful about testing vs karliso... that's really a bad test
 MSmits: these games are so deterministic
 MSmits: keep seeing the same game over and over with you two
 1415495: basically you want an 'optimistic' P2, I already saw that in RL but I don't remember seeing paper about the exact issue you want to address
 reCurse: It would help if I knew the academic term for my problem
 reCurse: It's usually half the battle
 reCurse: Branching has limitation, e.g. obvious captures in chess
 reCurse: In usefulness
 reCurse: Now that I think of it
 jacek: you have some love-hate relationship with uttt
 reCurse: There is no love involved at all
 reCurse: It just bothers me fundamentally that playing better makes you worse
 reCurse: There's something missing
 MSmits: it's much easier for games solved as a draw
 MSmits: like othello, problem doesnt exist there
 reCurse: It's like in the spring challenge where the bot would refuse to play because it only saw a lost position
 reCurse: Some maps are terrible
 jacek: learned helplessness eh
 struct: so currently if its losing it doesnt know what to do?
 reCurse: It doesn't see the point yeah
 reCurse: It never won like that in training
 reCurse: So there is no signal to reinforce
 MSmits: btw, I think the uttt version where you dont count won boards where noone has 3 in a row, is solved as draw
 1415495: reCurse: maybe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/computing-mistake-exploiting-strategies-in-very-large-zero-sum-games/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/computing-mistake-exploiting-strategies-in-very-large-zero-sum-games/</a> help find the 'name'
 MSmits: it's just too easy for p1, to have an extra won board
 Lysk: could be a training data problem, too similar to opponents, keeping some replays coming from a regular mcts could help
 reCurse: Hmm very interesting abstract
 reCurse: Will watch later, thanks
 reCurse: Lysk: Yeah I think there needs to be a minimum of 'skill gradation' kept somehow
 reCurse: Either by simulating horizons like I was talking about
 reCurse: or something else
 reCurse: A second network trained against a weaker player could be interesting too maybe
 reCurse: If the value gets too low use that one instead
 reCurse: shrug
 Lysk: so many hyper parameters to tune...
 MSmits: GA&#160;!
 reCurse: I'll be pretty busy so my computer needs company :P
 reCurse: Waiting for training runs is so boring anyway
 jacek: with summer at the corner?
 reCurse: Right, not the best time to run hot
 reCurse: I need to move further north :P
 AntiSquid: june is in 8 days, still rainy and cold outside, wth
 kovi: i like the idea of going against weaker playerit may not need nn though...
 reCurse: Broken yes
 byteful: is the JVM timing out&gt;
 jacek: arent we all
 AntiSquid: have your cabin at the foot of a canadian mountain, you can get your gear up with a rail car when things get too warm
 reCurse: Fantastic idea
 kovi: thx dbdr...yurko pushed me down to 9 few days ago
 reCurse: I think I'll tune training to give 5x more iterations to P2
 reCurse: Seems like the best in terms of simplicity and expected results
 reCurse: Forced balance
 MSmits: If you really want to do some good testing, it might help to have some varying strength local opponents, for example, running mcts with different calculation times, maybe a minimax bot in there
 moon_invader: something is wrong with the kotlin complier. I can't submit my code in Kotlin. all tests wrongs, but I am sure that it's not the case 
 YurkovAS: kovi i'm come back, when my duct start win vs classic mcts.
 MSmits: as i said, relying on the leaderboard seems bad now, with so few players of similar strength
 reCurse: Problem is it's difficult to have a firm grasp on if and how weaker a version is
 reCurse: Giving arbitrary more thinking time seems very easy
 reCurse: I could even find the correct number of iterations where P2 has 50% wr
 MSmits: it's the simplest solution yeah
 reCurse: That would be great
 MSmits: but jacek and karliso are going to play the same game every time. Well.. jacek is known to have some randomness, not sure what his current version does
 reCurse: Just to be clear
 jacek: im not sure either
 jacek: but i have randomness
 reCurse: It's more about addressing this problem
 MSmits: yeah but you want to good tests to know you've improved something 
 MSmits: (in this regard)
 reCurse: I'm thinking of forcing randomness on P2 for submit
 kovi: so nn imitating karliso can be top3?
 MSmits: dont think that works kofi
 MSmits: kovi
 jacek: kofee
 MSmits: he's deterministic in the sense that if someone always plays the same moves, he will only have a few variations, one or two being really common
 MSmits: but since all his opponents are different.... how will you imitate him
 reCurse: Good luck getting any data with CG crippling plays
 reCurse: I'm still mildly upset I can't test UTTT easily now
 MSmits: it's funny, when karliso loses to recurse, he loses usually at ply 25 because he forces a teccles move. If he didn't, he's winning at that point
 MSmits: the teccles move is losing
 reCurse: I really should just do ooc instead
 reCurse: ugh
 jacek: so many choices
 MSmits: do whats fun/motivates you
 MSmits: uttt is not in that category :P
 reCurse: Sunken costs
 MSmits: the only advantage that i can see is that you know the game well
 reCurse: If I didn't find glaring bugs in the challenge
 jacek: sunken? then this is ooc
 reCurse: But since I did, now I want to know what happens with uttt
 reCurse: And the idiot trap triggered
 MSmits: btw, if anyone is interested. It's ply 28 here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/533570388">https://www.codingame.com/replay/533570388</a>   karliso plays teccles and loses, he was winning before that
 MSmits: (I solved)
 MSmits: it's just a bad heuristic
 MSmits: so late in the game
 MSmits: this game repeats a lot
 reCurse: By the way I realized how amazing it is to have a game with random starts
 reCurse: So much easier to have good enough variety for all kinds of reasons
 reCurse: Local testing, training, etc
 reCurse: Stupid board games
 MSmits: I agree
 MSmits: Onitama would be cool maybe
 MSmits: also a challenge with the cards
 jacek: did you know? we have chess960 for this reason
 MSmits: :grin:
 reCurse: It's just something else to see the benefits in practice
 jacek: hmm during training in onitama p1 has 70% winrate
 struct: amazons is simple enough
 struct: jacek NN is waiting
 reCurse: Onitama looks interesting in theory but I can't bring myself to like watching it
 MSmits: jacek I am guessing this varies wildly with the particular start
 MSmits: possibly more starts have p1 advantage
 reCurse: OOC though, dealing with unknowns is pretty interesting
 jacek: i have random starts, but statistically p1 is favored anyway
 MSmits: a disadvantage to onitama is that every start is solvable quite easily, just not within CG timeframes
 reCurse: Oh is it now
 jacek: huh?
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: That's a shame
 MSmits: tric trac solved some within 100 ms
 MSmits: and they were excluded
 jacek: there were some 6 plies forced wins
 MSmits: but i am guessing the others take at most an hour or so
 jacek: but i tried most for 8 plies and i didnt find any
 MSmits: maybe a few hundred billion gamestates possible, small statespace
 MSmits: no, you may need an hour or so in some cases. Tric trac is pretty good with minimax
 jacek: still there are 131k starts
 MSmits: yeah in practice it is no problem
 elisaado: hi
 MSmits: same with bandas btw, also quite solvable for every board
 MSmits: just not in 1 second
 MSmits: probably can do every board within an hour
 UnknownStranger28: i thought this was going to be just creating games
 MSmits: no, you can create games here, but it's mostly about writing bots to play games
 jacek: creating bots for the games
 MSmits: we are too lazy to play games, so we make the computer play them
 UnknownStranger28: do they have one for the dinosaur game
 MSmits: are you talking about the google jumping t-rex
 UnknownStranger28: yeah
 MSmits: dont know tbh
 UnknownStranger28: i want to create a ai for that
 MSmits: i actually had a student do that
 jacek: MSmits what about this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/559292579">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/559292579</a>
 MSmits: there's examples for that, you can find
 MSmits: does that one happen a lot jacek?
 UnknownStranger28: wait your a teacher
 MSmits: I dont have my meta mcts running. Let me dig it upo
 jacek: no, just i won as p2 and wanted to show off
 MSmits: ohh lol
 MSmits: well done&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes UnknownStranger28
 UnknownStranger28: wow
 UnknownStranger28: wait for a school
 KelvinAndHubbles: what else are teachers for?
 MSmits: yeah physics and computer science
 MSmits: mostly 15-19 yr olds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Only be afraid of teachers who own fish farms ... fish food is life
 MSmits: give a man a fish and he eats for a day
 MSmits: teach a man to fish...
 Lysk: give him a fish farm and he will destroy the environment
 MSmits: right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, and cat-lady english teachers ... my GF..heh
 jacek: cat lady? :thinking:
 kovi: lysk: you mean recurse shouldnt share his nn fw?
 therealbeef: give a man a fire and he will be warm for a day. set a man on fire and he will be warm for the rest of his life
 Lysk: kovi, I was actually talking about fish in my last comment 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was referring to feeding people to the fish...so ... probably good for the environ
 reCurse:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: young people run from teachers... don't have to unless they own a fish farm
 jacek:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh, i knew a physicist who owned a fish farm ... scary dude
 KelvinAndHubbles: What he'd do? Chuck the fish and calculate velocity?
 reCurse: As long as it's not a pig farm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like old mob movie "feed 'em tot he fishies"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm sorry I'm being esoteric
 Lysk: MSmits, in bandas do you get very high reading time of the inputs (I start a chrono upon reading the first line and measuring time after reading the last line sometimes gives me 133ms)?
 MSmits: Lysk do you start after 1st line?
 MSmits: or before?
 Lysk: before
 MSmits: do it after
 MSmits: otherwise you include server time
 Lysk: kk, let me check
 MSmits: and opponent time
 MSmits: try to think about what the while loop does
 MSmits: you output a move
 MSmits: then it goes back to the beginning of the loop and tries to read input
 MSmits: but because you do it before the input, you start the measurement immediately after output
 MSmits: while you are waiting for opponent and server
 MSmits: thats why you do it after reading 1st input line
 MSmits: or last... i usually do last, doesnt seem to matter
 therealbeef: Snatch&#160;:-)
 Lysk: noobish mistake, got it , thank you,  now I only have my code bugs to account for
 reCurse: Thanks therealbeef, was concerned no one got it :P
 jacek: oh?
 MSmits: btw, jacek, still analysing that replay of yours
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: I think karliso should have taken the won board at ply 22, but even then the WR is low after that, so mistake might be even earlier
 MSmits: I keep hoping one of these days someone shows me a game where p2 can do a forced draw
 MSmits: maybe this is it&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reCurse i got it, scary AF too
 MSmits: I have reasonable confidence karliso was winning until ply 20 where he played a bad move. Your bot must be really strong now jacek, to capitalize on a single mistake early on
 jacek: or randomness kicked in
 jacek: see how the eval still is low
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab64460f-f2c4-4cf5-9e4d-a44e4f0a5061">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab64460f-f2c4-4cf5-9e4d-a44e4f0a5061</a>
 MSmits: 0 3 is board 0 square 3.  Thats what he played, but the other move seems much better
 jacek: you have mirrored board
 MSmits: yeah, i always rotate to lowest representation, its a bit annoying
 MSmits: i should fix that
 jacek: a bit
 jacek: pun intented?
 MSmits: no, but i'll take it
 MSmits: running 10 games at once is sooo nice though
 MSmits: this would have taken an hour otherwise
 Fougayrre: Anyone having problem with kotlin currently?
 MSmits: broken
 MSmits: they'll fix it
 MSmits: eventually...
 Fougayrre: Oh
 Fougayrre:&#160;:(
 jacek: on monday
 jacek: at best
 MSmits: this might be a great opportunity to learn a new language
 Fougayrre: :D
 Fougayrre: Just wanted to prove to a friend I was better for a quick game&#160;:(
 Ryunos: but you're not.
 Ryunos: (hi i'm "a friend")
 MSmits: oh, he's gonna think you're making excuses Fougayrre :P
 jacek: oO
 Ryunos: since we're both doing it in kotlin...
 MSmits: oh nvm then :0
 Fougayrre: Time to get the old python out
 Ryunos: we were just bugging, reading the python code of the guys who were first and not understanding why our code wouldn't pass
 jacek: MSmits another one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/559300230">https://www.codingame.com/replay/559300230</a>  well at this point i can somewhat win with p2 against him
 jacek: w00t? whos thies reLu guy
 reLu: My test account
 jacek: canadian :thinking:
 reCurse: Woops wrong window
 jacek: ban
 reCurse: Well batches don't work anymore
 reCurse: So sue me
 reCurse: Seems better at least
 reCurse: I'd be mildly upset if fixing bugs made things worse
 jacek: is this with p2 5x times
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: Just the challenge version
 reCurse: With bug fixes
 reCurse: And improvements
 reCurse: And medium length training
 reCurse: There's room for more refinement I think

 MSmits: karliso made mistake at pl 32, he could have won if he made the right move there, i solved it
 MSmits: you had already lost when you took the first miniboard
 MSmits: but he didnt see it, so... good one&#160;:)

 Lachrymosa: Hey CG, a friend is asking me for advice/help on starting to learn Python. When I learned it I used code academy, but thats when they were free.  Do you all have any free beginner courses you'd recommend?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers">https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers</a>
 Lachrymosa: :thumbsup_tone1:
 MSmits: Lachrymosa I dont think python3 was ever free on codecademy, i think their python2 course was
 MSmits: might be mistaken though
 Lachrymosa: Thats probably true cause I learned with 2
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: whats the different except you need () for print :v
 MSmits: there's some other small differences like that, but i bet when you're using advanced stuff you will notice many more
 Lachrymosa: Theres quite a bit lol, but its all minor 
 jacek: that ands bytes/unicode string stuff
 MSmits: at work i use a lot of trinket.io. We embed it into a our learning environment (moodle) and make exercises with it
 MSmits: thats how we teach python
 jacek: oh my, will karliso go down
 MSmits: recurs e always had 50+&#160;% wr vs karliso
 Scarfield: Lachrymosa <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU</a> a channel full of python tutorial/explanation etc
 MSmits: but it's mostly RPS i think. Karliso had better wr overall
 reCurse: You're reading it wrong
 reCurse: That new bot is doing terrible vs him
 reCurse: It's always been finnicky finding a good version for him anyway
 MSmits: yes, that makes sense
 reCurse: But at least on all other aspects it's doing better I think
 reCurse: So no regressions yay
 reCurse: Much happier to have something without all the hacks of the previous one
 MSmits: I would ignore the results vs karliso
 jacek: not even logistic regression? nice
 reCurse: I'll submit a random version next
 reCurse: See what happens
 MSmits: cool
 reCurse: And let the training run tonight probably
 reCurse: Maybe there's more elo to squeeze
 MSmits: at least that gives you some confidence vs karliso, if one of you does some random
 struct: elo gains on sf looking hard to get
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://m.nextchessmove.com/dev-builds">https://m.nextchessmove.com/dev-builds</a>
 reCurse: I'm fortunately nowhere near as optimal
 reCurse: So elo gains are still achievable overnight
 jacek: welp they have problem passing new nets
 struct: they uodated their net I think
 struct: updated*
 jacek: recently yeah
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3474">https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/3474</a>
 jacek: but even if the new net is better, the search params are optimized for the old one
 struct: I see
 jacek: so not only train new net, but optimize other things around it. more resources are required
 reCurse: As expected random openings are garbage
 jacek: random? as in not center?
 reCurse: Random as in use visit count as stochastic policy
 reCurse: For first few moves

 Zenoscave: I think the model is overfit. Those are too close to actual lines
 Lysk: can you have samples at the end of an epoch (or n steps) to see the changes?
 Zenoscave: No it's just a stochastic model of (part-of-speech, word) tuples

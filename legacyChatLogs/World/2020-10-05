 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Bc...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I gotta
 MadKnight: what kaggle jrke&#160;?
 MadKnight: but why, MaliciouslyCrypticUsername&#160;?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: n,e=int(input()),0for i in range(n):
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Any way to make that shorter?
 MadKnight: can't u multiply
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: No, because if you notice, I'm doing n-i
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: So I can't just do it in the beginning
 MadKnight: e+=n-i-1
 MadKnight: inside first for
 MadKnight: and then it's a progression
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ...
 MadKnight: there's a formula too
 jrke: is it sum of first n numbers?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Goal-When you go out to dinner with your friends, everyone toasts with everyone else once. You wonder how often one glass bumps into another.
 jrke: oh its easy 
 jrke: do it

 MadKnight: oh, pew
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ...
 MadKnight: lol
 jrke: make it short malicious
 MadKnight: MaliciouslyCrypticUsername learning thatfor j in range(n-i-1):e+=1is the same ase += n-i-1
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Yea I get the idea now
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I never thought of it though, I got stuck on the idea of looping
 cg000: p (a=gets.to_i)*(a-1)/n
 MadKnight: no that's ruby
 jrke: in python

 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: loool

 jacek: wah
 jthemphill: ew, i'm not a fan of how the kaggle football competition is laid out
 jthemphill: like it's really obvious that they don't want anyone to solve it in a way that isn't RL
 jthemphill: i feel like in general ML is going down this dead end of trying to solve literally every problem with black-box RL, even though the most successful ML players (*cough* AlphaGo) wind up using ML in combination with a search algorithm
 jthemphill: oh okay they do give you the actual engine code in C++, it's just kind of hidden
 jacek: lets NN everything
 AntiSquid: quite sure you can modify stuff your way on kaggle
 AntiSquid: there are usually example notebooks without any ML in them as an entry so ...
 jrke: i submitted my bot on kaggle today reached 920 score 46th rank then started loosing currently 740 scorewith 130 rank in football
 jrke: squidy are you having ML bot?
 AntiSquid: it's a basic starter bot just to see how the game works, not into football actually and no time atm so ...
 AntiSquid: it has some ML, but it's a joke implementation

 jacek: hm?
 jrke: does bot programming can also become PotW
 KiwiTae: Potw?
 sDCrAZzE: i pooped
 jrke: puzzle of the week = PotW
 KiwiTae: I dont recall seeing it happening
 sDCrAZzE: poopoo
 jrke: the current PotW is Bot programming
 Shadowtick: I finally finished scrabble :smile:
 darkhorse64: It already happened to Breakthough and gave it a nice audience boost
 jrke: oh
 darkhorse64: *Breakthrough*
 Shadowtick: ... ok?
 jrke: now its onitama's turn
 Shadowtick: I'm confused about what's happening right now
 darkhorse64: Paper soccer and checkers too
 darkhorse64: Onitama engine is a bit more difficult to code than usual for a board game because available moves for a given pawn vary according to its position on the board. The referee code is quite helpful for a start
 darkhorse64: Moves depend also on the cards you have in hand
 darkhorse64: I ended up precomputing all moves for all positions and all cards
 eulerscheZahl: Onitama is puzzle of the week \o/
 Shadowtick: ...
 eulerscheZahl: i'm slightly confused, wasn't it before?
 Shadowtick: brb
 Scarfield: i think it has been before, but i dont pay too much attention to puzzle of the week tbh
 eulerscheZahl: usually i don't either. except if it's my contributino
 eulerscheZahl: i had some puzzles of the week already, so i might be wrong which of them exactly has been before
 Scarfield: i dont have that "issue" yet :p
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure about vindinium, cgfunge prime and number shifting
 eulerscheZahl: and space maze and sokoban haven't been yet
 eulerscheZahl: that would be fun :D
 Scarfield: oh yea, i completely forgot about space maze, gotta have a look at that one soon, seemed very interesting, and challenging&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: let's say it this way: 50XP is an insult for solving it
 tibu:   
 eulerscheZahl:  
 tibu: How to count min ways for transform 2 to 100 by n-=1 or multify n by 2.
 tibu: The answer is 9, but i got confused the approach
 eulerscheZahl: what is "min ways"
 eulerscheZahl: number of ways or minimum steps would make sense to me
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you mean the minimum number of steps needed, as there are infinite ways
 eulerscheZahl: do you know BFS?
 tibu: yes min steps
 tibu: how to implement BFS for this problem?
 eulerscheZahl: you have a list of reachable numbers: [2]
 eulerscheZahl: then for each number x you compute x-1 and x*2
 eulerscheZahl: so: [1, 4]
 eulerscheZahl: do the same again with the new list
 eulerscheZahl: [0,2,3,8]
 eulerscheZahl: repeat until there's a 100
 eulerscheZahl: use a set instead of list for a better performance
 tibu: im still confused
 BoBot: ((2*2*2-1)*2-1)*2-1)*2*2
 BoBot: yup, 9! :D
 eulerscheZahl: you know python, tibu?
 tibu: yes, i know 
 boon-cpu: yooooo
 tibu: BoBot you are amazing&#160;:))
 BoBot: @tibu tibu means "baby chicken" in Estonian, had to check if you were not from my home country :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/sDsWCKw">https://tech.io/snippet/sDsWCKw</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i coded it, might be easier than writing my thoughts in prosa
 BoBot: loool, meanwhile...
 AntiSquid: interesting multi as puzzle of the week again
 BoBot: btw, eulerscheZahl, Onimata is cool :D I know it was not your invention - have you played the real one?
 tibu: thanks
 BoBot: I did not even know there are MP Puzzles of the Week
 BoBot: before
 BoBot: multiplayer*
 eulerscheZahl: i've never played Onitama in real life. was browsing boardgamegeeks to look for fun games to put on CG
 BoBot: really simple rules, but I have a feeling it is complex enough to not be trivial
 eulerscheZahl: you have to promote 1 league to mark the puzzle of the week as solved
 eulerscheZahl: there are a few cases where you can enforce a win after 5 turns (because of random card selection on setup)but thanks to trictrac those are excluded from the game
 BoBot: I noticed from source code you had to remove some "trivial" setups
 BoBot: yea (Y)
 BoBot: was just commenting on that :D
 BoBot: nice to see those removed...I guess it is not as important face to face, most players would not solve the game so easily
 eulerscheZahl: someone actually had a look at the code, nice
 BoBot: I wanted to see how the cards are created, saw that specific cards even have (animal) names
 BoBot: i.e. if I was going to implement a simulation, which cards would I need to create or what limits are there
 BoBot: to the possible moves*
 eulerscheZahl: i stuck to the original game herethere are extension packs with some more cards
 eulerscheZahl: but those have even more trivial cases
 BoBot: yea I guess in the real game the trivial solutions matter less
 eulerscheZahl: someone on the boardgamegeeks forum did the maths
 BoBot: or not... :D 
 BoBot: I guess they are "geeks"
 eulerscheZahl: true. but our bots can think a few turns ahead
 eulerscheZahl: even my #12 bot could solve the trivial ones
 BoBot: not mine :D
 BoBot: I have minimax with 1 turn atm
 BoBot: but that is after ~1h of work
 eulerscheZahl: should be enough to promote
 eulerscheZahl: boss is only capturing if possible, random otherwise
 BoBot: almost, close, I think it does not pick the best move even at depth 1 at the moment
 BoBot: still wins games by random
 BoBot: will fix it in a minute or 10
 eulerscheZahl: the move generation is where i screwed up initially. rotating the cards made my head hurt :D
 BoBot: oh, damn, haven't even thought of that
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile the UK struggles with large excel files <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates-cases-testing-a4563146.html">https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates-cases-testing-a4563146.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised/shocked that they use excel for that purpose
 BoBot: they really do not belong in the EU - EU officials are notorious for their love of large Excel files :D
 BoBot: at least that is how people mock the gov/EU in my country :D
 BoBot: "put it into Excel"
 BoBot: lol, my scoring function looked like this:
 BoBot: no wonder it does not distinguish moves
 Shadowtick: back
 eulerscheZahl: nice scoring :D
 BoBot: I like creating stub code, good skill for creating code fast that "works" i.e. does not crash :D
 BoBot: need more TODO-s
 sparky: a lot of us did vote to remain in the EU..
 eulerscheZahl: unrelated, as you are in the UK: do you know any game developers living there?
 BoBot: haha I am well aware, I watch a lot of UK comedy panel shows :D
 BoBot: my new favorite is Frankie Boyle's New World Order
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's mostly lastweektonight and patriot act
 BoBot: not a lot of support for Leave from the comedians...except for John Cleese....&#160;:/
 BoBot: John Oliver is great, have not watched Patriot Act
 eulerscheZahl: entertaining too. and dedicated a whole episode to some issue our society has
 eulerscheZahl: similar to lastweektonight
 eulerscheZahl: but less crazy ideas
 eulerscheZahl: like sponsoring the marble racing league
 eulerscheZahl: or baking a huge cake with an insult to the guiness world records printed on it
 eulerscheZahl: or a musical about Bob Murray
 sparky: eulerscheZahl No, don't know any game developers, I'm in the 'business' programming world
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 Astrobytes: I've got someone getting back to me re. UK game dev
 BoBot:  ok, took me 45 minutes, but I do not miss killer moves now :P
 BoBot: "1 turn wins"
 Shadowtick: can anyone help me with legends of code &amp; magic
 BoBot: wow, I did not know they have kept on developing the game
 BoBot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://legendsofcodeandmagic.com/">https://legendsofcodeandmagic.com/</a>
 BoBot: did you find this site already? it looks like it could have some resources
 Shadowtick: what do you mean by that?
 BoBot: after the contest on Codingame, it looks like they kept on developing and creating contests for it
 BoBot: I took part of that contest, but my strategy was influenced by 10+ years of playing Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone, hard to give a summary of that :D
 BoBot: do you have specific questions?
 Shadowtick: ok?
 BoBot: ok?
 BoBot: (just testing if you are a chatbot)
 Shadowtick: -3- wow I said ok? because I was saying it the your message that said after the contest on Codingame, it looks like they kept on developing and creating contests for it
 Shadowtick: to the*
 Shadowtick: god dang I am having a horrible time with grammar today
 Shadowtick: I meant to say to your
 Shadowtick: but to be honest I am not a chatbot
 BoBot: yea, I shared a link to their site, first hit on google
 BoBot: jk man :D
 BoBot: and I was surprised that this game had a new life off Codingame
 Shadowtick: what do you mean by that????
 jrke: bot programming is best part of codingame
 BoBot: dude @jrke your bot is keeping me in Wood 2
 BoBot: get promoted already
 jrke: lol its just my 5 minute work
 BoBot: lol mine is 1.5h, we will see who will have the last laugh
 jrke: i won't do a lot on this just a simple bot 
 jrke: and see i wanted to improve it later
 jrke: if
 Shadowtick: ... imma just put my favorite song on real quick
 Shadowtick: back
 jrke: BoBot wait a min then submit 
 jrke: cause i will be in wood 1 then
 Shadowtick: anyone wanna see my coders strike back ai?
 jrke: whats your rank in it?
 Shadowtick: mine?
 jrke: Shadowtick&#160;?? whats your rank in Coders Strike Back
 Shadowtick: let me go check it again
 jrke: yes yours
 Shadowtick: 1,394th/44,479
 jrke: league silver?
 jrke: try to make legend
 Shadowtick: no wood league 2
 jrke: oke
 Shadowtick: how do I do it with the nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90 but it wont make my pod stop
 LegendaryStone: MystiquePanda Can you share code please :pensive:
 jacek: oh, puzzle of the week
 D0ted: anyone know how to do the part where you have to add the  nextcheckpoint angle &gt; 90
 eulerscheZahl: more like "multiplayer of the week"
 eulerscheZahl: except for CSB. that one is always the multiplayer of the week
 eulerscheZahl: 8 new players already, not bad
 jacek: how much $$$ did you pay for make it for the week
 Scarfield: 4 dogecoins 
 JBM: such wow
 Shadowtick: hi
 jacek: how does puzzle of the week quest look in this case? you just submit random bot and youre done?
 Shadowtick: huh?
 Scarfield: promote one league to "solve" i think, euler mentioned something like this earlier
 Shadowtick: I am just gonna not ask what is going on
 eulerscheZahl: at least that's what thibaud said when the quest map was introduced
 eulerscheZahl: i had the same question

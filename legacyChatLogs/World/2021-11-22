 Wontonimo: seems very level headed from what I've seen
 Thorcode: solve puzzle to level up :D
 Wontonimo: haven't chatted with him though
 ZXC01: does puzzels improve ranking?
 Thorcode: no
 Wontonimo: puzzles work with levels
 ZXC01: oh
 Thorcode: CP improve rank
 Wontonimo: multis work with experience and ranking
 ZXC01: o
 Wontonimo: hey Struct, when did they introduce the 2 different scores&#160;: XP / CP&#160;?
 n0b1e: Hey Wontonimo im a big fan of your keep it up man
 Thorcode: I'm very close to master onlly 300 rank more
 struct: I dont know about it Wontonimo
 n0b1e: I hope to reach your level one day
 Thorcode: but it is a long way
 Wontonimo: oh, thanks n0b1e 
 Thorcode: I think the quest map do that for you Wontonimo
 n0b1e: np
 Wontonimo: i know the quest map was sometime late last year right?
 struct: I was afk when it was released
 Thorcode: I know how to earn cp through clicking at my rank
 DialFrost: js do bot programming
 DialFrost: u can get up to more than 150,000 cp
 DialFrost: (if ur good at coding)
 Thorcode: or code golf and clash or optimization
 DialFrost: clash only has max of 5,000
 ZXC01: what&#160;?? earn cp through click your rank?
 DialFrost: noononono
 Thorcode: no
 DialFrost: he click rank so he can see how to earn cp
 ZXC01: lol just kiding
 Thorcode: yep
 DialFrost: ...
 Thorcode: my rank at my country pretty cool
 ZXC01: how do you check that?
 DialFrost: go profile
 DialFrost: then click the box where it shows u ur rank
 DialFrost: it will show the breakdown of the cp u have earned
 ZXC01: om top 0.3%
 ZXC01: your from sg too right DialFrost?
 DialFrost: er yes
 DialFrost: not many from sg
 ZXC01: yeah
 DialFrost: uk anyone else?
 n0b1e: am from uk
 ZXC01: some one name See Translation
 ZXC01: and codeab
 DialFrost: huh wat lol
 Thorcode: I am from VN :D
 n0b1e: nice
 Codeab: someone call me? zxc01
 Codeab:&#160;:)
 ZXC01: no... just talking about i we know anyone from sg:neutral_face:
 DialFrost: lol
 Thorcode: or little bear
 Thorcode: he was one of my friend but now he is afk&#160;:(
 ZXC01: hmm
 Thorcode: he is kinda cool
 ZXC01: lots of people just play for a while and disappears
 Thorcode: yep

 ZXC01: more simplyfied
 Uljahn: X,Y,x,y=map(int,input().split())
 ZXC01: wow thanks!!
 Uljahn: did your code pass all testcases? i think i see some errors
 ZXC01: it passed
 Uljahn: indeed
 Uljahn: it doesn't pass original puzzle tests though
 ZXC01: really?
 ZXC01: i think it the test 4 right?
 Uljahn: ye, because of different coverage
 ZXC01: yeah
 Uljahn: codegolf and classic puzzle have different testcases
 ZXC01: i didnt know that
 Uljahn: me too
 Thorcode: no I think they are same
 Uljahn: :rolling_eyes:
 Uljahn: test 4 is clearly not the same, Power of Thor ep.1 classic vs codegolf
 Thorcode: no I don't think so
 Uljahn: bruh
 Thorcode: I use the same code it still work
 Thorcode: oh yeah
 Uljahn: you clearly can't read
 Thorcode: why I can't read
 Uljahn: we are talking about the code which passes golf and doesn't pass classic, in the link above
 Thorcode: oh ok
 Uljahn: jeez
 Thorcode: FOr that code I think in codegolf I can golf more
 Thorcode: that code is strange

 JeremyRoussy: Hello, someone can help me please&#160;? My code is to slow for the puzzle "stock exchange losses". Indeed I have a for loop into another for loop. I know it's bad for optimisation, but I don't know how to do it in another way.
 WildSmilodon: Jeremy, you need an if before the second loop
 JeremyRoussy: to verify what&#160;?
 WildSmilodon: and the second loop goes from i+1 not from 0
 JeremyRoussy: and why i+1 and not i&#160;?
 WildSmilodon: Cant really remember, it was long ago, I just looked at my solution
 WildSmilodon: Send a private message, I can share the entire loop privately
 JeremyRoussy: sure
 5DN1L: You may also try reading the discussion to find hints: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/stock-exchange-losses-puzzle-discussion/40/28">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/stock-exchange-losses-puzzle-discussion/40/28</a>

 JeremyRoussy: thanks&#160;!
 JeremyRoussy: I will read all tips
 vaeng: What happens when my contribution has not been approved or rejected after 30 days?
 struct: you can reupload it
 struct: and it gets 30 days again
 struct: it keeps the upvotes and approvals
 vaeng: and the rejects and downvotes as well?
 struct: I think so
 vaeng: So it's mainly waiting, or is there some kind of promotion channel?
 eulerscheZahl: it will not keep the approvals and refusals in fact. only the upvotes/downvotes and comments
 eulerscheZahl: you can only play the waiting game
 eulerscheZahl: together with the 100 or so other contributions
 vaeng: Yeah, it's a lot. I'm glad this site is so active
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/</a>you get a good idea about when the quest map got introduced
 eulerscheZahl: at the cost of content quality I have a feeling
 struct: at least they didnt create a quest for "create a multi"
 eulerscheZahl: we have "play 12 contests"
 eulerscheZahl: and "create a contest"
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: TIP
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: RIP
 derjack: yet another book wars in othello
 struct: time to delete it
 struct: :fire:
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Your account?
 struct: no, othello
 eulerscheZahl: we can downvote it if you want
 struct: cg needs to remove downvotes just like youtube
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get it: i still see them for some videos. can the uploader decide whether or not to show downvotes?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I still can downvote...
 struct: dont know how it works, I can still see downvotes
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait: i see and don't see the downvotes depending on cookies it seems
 struct: But some people for the same video cant see it
 struct: yeah euler
 eulerscheZahl: incognito hides downvotes
 eulerscheZahl: most of the time they give you an idea whether or not it's worth watching a video
 eulerscheZahl: except if it's about covid. then many downvotes mean high quality
 Medoo: Aheahaeh
 [CG]Thibaud: &gt; cg needs to remove downvotes just like youtubeI've written down an idea about this 2 weeks ago
 eulerscheZahl: are you kidding?
 [CG]Thibaud: no
 [CG]Thibaud: not sure I should push for it though or how to back it up with some kind of data
 eulerscheZahl: hiding downvotes also makes upvotes pointless. it turns into a number without any relation
 <b>**BlaiseVonEbuthIV erase the message saying this is a shitty idea he was about to send before the cm pop...</b></p><p><img src="/a/20943796238707" /> [CG]Thibaud: not entirely pointless, but yeah, you lose some sense
 struct: I dont see the benefits of hiding it
 eulerscheZahl: less hurt feelings for creators of sub-par contributions?
 struct: oh no my feelings 
 struct: who cares
 eulerscheZahl: we have to actively write something to hurt feeling now
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't see their benefits actually.
 [CG]Thibaud: good puzzles get upvotes, bad puzzles don't
 eulerscheZahl: but because they are bad or because no one has seen them yet?
 struct: checking downvotes is easier
 struct: ^
 struct: on youtube they say it was used to target individuals, I think its easier to control on cg
 [CG]Thibaud: there is a views counter (which gives an idea)
 eulerscheZahl: there's still a range between good(=upvote) and bad(=downvote) when you just close the tab and not vote at all
 eulerscheZahl: removing downvotes merges those two
 [CG]Thibaud: true
 [CG]Thibaud: merging bad and "not interesting enough for now"&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: I mean highlighting good contribs is enough, do we need to highlight bad ones? Same for comments?
 [CG]Thibaud: as contributors, did you care at all about downvotes? Wondered why you got some? (if you did ^^)
 struct: well I didnt because I didnt really put any real effort into my contribtuions
 eulerscheZahl: there are always a few downvotes or 1-star reviews. but it's interesting to see if it's really just 1 or 2 or more than that. especially when you try completely new ideas such as Number Shifting where you are supposed to solve offline
 eulerscheZahl: of course I like text comments more
 [CG]Thibaud: maybe it's a bad idea
 [CG]Thibaud: I filed it after a second contributor, which seemed decent, received a few downvotes without any comment on a new contrib. Not really friendly
 Uljahn: i think bad contributions should be rejected, which is easier when highlighted by massive downvotes, so it's mot your personal taste but backed up by community
 Uljahn: *it's not
 eulerscheZahl: personally I prefer having downvotes. but nothing I care enough about to start a lengthy discussion
 eulerscheZahl: also see it this way: there is 1 contributor who might have a bad experience. but if we want to please that one user and approve bad content, it will be played by over 100 users until it gets refused, displeasing many more
 [CG]Thibaud: true
 Westicles: If you want contrib reform, I would recommend doing something about all the WIPs.  So many of them get created and abandoned, they just clog the page for a month
 eulerscheZahl: ++
 eulerscheZahl: or much longer *cough*troll vs castle*cough*
 struct: add "trending"
 eulerscheZahl: there was trending years ago (most upvotes)
 eulerscheZahl: before the WIP and 30 day features got added
 Uljahn: 50+ upvotes == +1 auto-approval, each upvote is +1 day in the list (starting from 5-10) :upside_down:
 eulerscheZahl: auto-approval doesn't sound right
 eulerscheZahl: i upvote semi-finished stuff like jrke's rubik cube, if i see potnetial
 Andriamanitra: if anything the contribution approval process needs to be less friendly
 Westicles: hmmm, one of my reverses got deactivated.  people just don't appreciate great art
 eulerscheZahl: which one?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/743885ae9b7ceb7c2baab0a024ef5195de0d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/743885ae9b7ceb7c2baab0a024ef5195de0d</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it while i was pending. only understood what's going on after reading your solution
 eulerscheZahl: so i guess it got refused because too hard to guess
 Westicles: yeah, reverses are tricky.  probably you want at least 90% of people to see the trick in under a minute (or something)
 eulerscheZahl: hard to find the sweet spot. too obvious is boring too
 JBM: but approvals are biased because they see the solution
 JBM: which biases more
 JBM: oh wait no, they're biased because they don't need to solve and they're part of the quest map
 Andriamanitra: i ran into that in the wild a while back, even after seeing the trick it is ambiguous if it's required that the other two words combine into exactly the third word or can there be duplicate letters or overlap or any number of other things
 eulerscheZahl: it's reverse(a+b) == c =&gt; print(c)
 Andriamanitra: yeah i think i did (a+b).chars.tally == c.chars.tally or something
 eulerscheZahl: tally?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know RUby
 Andriamanitra: similar to python's Counter
 eulerscheZahl: apparently i don't know Python either :D
 Westicles: well, sounds like the process worked.  it wasn't so great and got removed after a couple weeks
 eulerscheZahl: i thought I did
 Andriamanitra: it counts how many of each character, returns a hash

 Manchi_o6o7: here is the part of code
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: "I have a loop that run while the list size is &gt; 0, inside this loop I delete an element of this list by 1 each turn. I really don't see why it stop... :thinking:"
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: -by one
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: tired
 Manchi_o6o7: but the thing it it freezes after the second iteration
 Manchi_o6o7: is*
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: "freezes"
 Manchi_o6o7: what am I saying wrong?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: What is "it" and what is "freezes"
 Manchi_o6o7: the console isn't printing or doing anything
 Manchi_o6o7: it prints the first two random numbers (so it iterates two times)
 Manchi_o6o7: and after that nothing happens
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Yeah. But is something supposed to happens&#160;?
 Manchi_o6o7: it is supposed to delete 1020 elements from the list
 Manchi_o6o7: the list size is &gt;0
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: You're using cout to print, so it's considered as your answer.

 Schwase: oh i probably shouldnt have shared my code since its supposed to be hidden
 Schwase: at least it doesnt work
 Greycooper: you have that positive values are put before negative ones?

 xxd: is there a relevant thread i can view to  get up to speed on this
 Uljahn: it's not available i guess
 Uljahn: i mean the escape room
 xxd: normally there are the discussion threads right
 xxd: not for this one?
 jacek: there is/was discord channel
 Uljahn: and the thread is on the forums
 Scarfield: i dont think the contest will be available (?)
 jacek: soon as multiplayer bot game, as it was always with past contests...
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Scarfield: "bot game" oof
 Uljahn: bot games are soo 2019
 Westicles: It was very difficult to solve for non-English speakers and other indigenous peoples without computers.  Hopefully they will work on that next year
 Scarfield: but on a serious note, didnt they say that the contest wouldnt be available again?
 Scarfield: xD

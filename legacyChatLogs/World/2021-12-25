 ninjadip: merry christmas
 ninjadip: any1 do any cool ascii art clashes with christmas trees?
 WonderfulPlays: Is there any way to disable Shortest mode
 WonderfulPlays: in Clash of code?
 PatrykJagielski: nope
 jacek: why everypony hates shortest mode
 WonderfulPlays: shame, the mode is so stupid&#160;:(
 WonderfulPlays: it makes you write bad code and promotes certain languages
 Morian1: Okie.
 ninjadip: that's life
 ninjadip: that's the lesson
 Dynobites: Yup
 ninjadip: that every scenario will not always be ideal
 fmko: Love the shortest mode :D 
 jacek: oh my
 WonderfulPlays: I am just going to skip every shortest mode i guess
 jacek: youre doing java or c#?
 ninjadip: im doing c++ and i don't get any breaks 
 jacek: then how do you leave loops prematurely
 ninjadip: break;
 ninjadip:&#160;?
 jacek: ha!
 ninjadip: oh my i just got it
 ninjadip: lol&#160;:)
 fmko: :joy:
 SethwillCode: hey so i know literally nothing about coding, i've tried a couple different games including clash but none are actually teaching me how to write in code/ understand how to read it, does anybody here recommend any specific games or other sites that may instruct better&#160;?
 AlexDev01: hackerank for algo
 AlexDev01: algos
 ninjadip: finally! bugged a crash every 3 lap
 SethwillCode: ty alex
 AlexDev01: @sethwillcode I wanted to write a longer answer but the clash started, anyways, if you want to get better at coding you should srart with building personal projects and not competing. Once you feel like you know the language enough and you like logic you shall exercise on algos, data structure, maths etc... and with time you'll get better at solving problems.
 SethwillCode: ah I see, I've 0 knowledge of even the fundamentals &amp; every game/site I get recc'd expects you to know at least how to write in each language
 Bubbly_Bee: Hi SethwillCode. I think you will have to read some tutorial first for some language. Or If you have no experience with programming, maybe try "Scratch" or any other graphical programming language
 Sideway: which langage have you chosen to start with&#160;?
 RegexPro: js, C#
 SethwillCode: i've been trying to work with C++ but I have no preferences, just want to be marketable y'know?
 RegexPro: make market research in your region, no other choises
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm deciding whether or not to have a 2nd coffee

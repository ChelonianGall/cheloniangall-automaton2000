 thethiny: You price yourself
 Ikhadem: thanks
 Kellthazar: Well, in this case, you can check if the pac is in the same place for more than one turn.
 Kellthazar: and tell him to try to go to another direction
 kdhakal: could you explain that in code plz
 Kellthazar: your pacman could be an object, and have two properties: currentPosition, lastPosition
 Kellthazar: even the currentDirection that he'is going
 Kellthazar: if currentPosition == lastPosition
 Kellthazar: try another direction
 kdhakal: thanks I'll try that
 Kellthazar: But this is not the best approach to take this problem...&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: you receive the grid layout on the begining...
 SamuelTheBad: the best approach to the problem is to avoid it happening :wink:
 SamuelTheBad: i say in agreement, having still not implemented any proper pathfinding myself
 Pranab: help any1. how to find if a pac is dead? 
 SamuelTheBad: assuming you're in bronze, you'll have to use the fact you don't receive an input line for a dead pac
 Pranab: okay thanks
 Dav1dS: wow! I added some basic collision detection and avoidance and my rank jumped 200 points 
 thethiny: is there a way to hide the IDE?
 AlexArb: (about the "get a better job" form)Â¿in which country is OK to ask for a Minimum annual salary of over 20k USD? Mine is 2.7k and can't complain lol
 AntiSquid: hi
 anid: Hi, I have a certain battle where I had a timeout
 anid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462479488">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462479488</a>
 anid: But I am not able to replicate it in the IDE as the opponent`s bot is not deterministic
 anid: Is there anything that can be done?
 anid: dbdr
 anid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462540012">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462540012</a>
 anid: Is it a problem on the server as dbdr is timing out as well?
 Uljahn: you can't make games in ide vs rust. they'll timeout
 anid: K, but how do I replicate my timeout in the IDE?
 anid: I have done several replays in the same seed and it is not happening
 dbdr: anid <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/FAQ">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/FAQ</a>
 anid: thanks dbdr
 Illedan: dbdr having that on speed dial :D
 dbdr: yeah, need to script/bot it
 Illedan: Maybe Automation2000 can help
 dbdr: writing the FAQ was a good investment
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: @anid: For someone that went from noob to guru in a mere two weeks, you seems to miss some key knowledge
 dbdr: :thinking:
 JBM: :see_no_evil:
 AntiSquid: going up and down the ranking based on time of the day
 dbdr: let depth = 10 + cos(time.hour) * 5;
 WINWINWIN: We can use the pathfinding in the referee right?
 WINWINWIN: I mean to say that we can translate it to our language and make modifications right?
 darkhorse64: Add a decay on the constant and you have the right formula for me
 Doju: Hey everyone
 Doju: do you think that i should go for a sim or just trying to perfect a probability system
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: what do you think?
 Automaton2000: maybe you dont have an opening book
 Uljahn: good point
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: do you like that spoonfeeding contest?
 Automaton2000: not sure how to change it?
 Quidome: I have a deterministic bot, playing against myself still gives me different match length, how is that possible? (seem seed)
 Doju: Quidome i have the same thing
 Uljahn: with the same seed and deterministic opponent?
 Quidome: yep
 Doju: i think it might have something to do with sets since they arent ordered
 Quidome: ok, I use set's indeed
 Uljahn: ye, your bot isn't deterministic
 Quidome: I don't use random
 Uljahn: doesn't matter
 Quidome: :thinking:
 RoboStac: HashSet / HashMap in rust does use random though
 llllllllll: yesterday evening i was ~150th, this morning ~300th. SLOW DOWN GUYS
 llllllllll: take a sleep or something, jeez
 Quidome: Aha, that explains
 Quidome: annoying
 Quidome: I was blaming the other bot :D
 Quidome: It was me...
 jrke: why my rank increase time by time same code why is that
 Doju: there's a lot of noise jrke
 Doju: you just get lucky or unlucky sometimes
 WINWINWIN: In order to get to silver, which is the more important ability SPEED or SWITCH?
 llllllllll: switch
 Quidome: Yes and i hace the same, when you don't submit for a day you go up
 Doju: WINWINWIN i'm not silver but i'd say speed
 jrke: hey winwin
 llllllllll: i havent used speed until I reached top~400
 llllllllll: speed is hard, compared to switch
 Doju: whatt
 Doju: i'm just spamming speed
 Doju: don't even have switch coded in
 Doju: and i'm at 350
 llllllllll: then I guess that works too
 Doju: i think once i get pathfinding working so that pacs won't collide with eachother i'm gonna climb another few ranks
 Doju: we'll see. hoping to get it online in an hour or so
 WINWINWIN: Doju, I was seriously considering copy-pasting the referees pathfinding and tweaking the allowed points to avoid collisions :P
 Doju: hmm
 Doju: what's the referee...?
 Uljahn: "You can check out the source code of this game on this GitHub repo."
 Uljahn: it's in the rules
 Doju: oh thaat
 Doju: i wasn't sure what you meant by referee. english isn't my first language
 Uljahn: server-side code with full game rules which manages your actions
 Doju: yup, i figured it out. thanks
 Chkoupinator: hey peeps, I wanted to ask some questions about performance to know which programming language to select
 Chkoupinator: I'm more used to Python but I'm pretty good at C++ too
 Chkoupinator: does performance matter or can I pick any?
 llllllllll: C++ &gt;&gt; Python in speed
 Doju: performance matters if you want to do something fancy
 llllllllll: if you want to reach top position, performance will matter
 Doju: such as simulating moves
 llllllllll: look at the top guys programing language picks
 Chkoupinator: I'll go with C++ then thanks
 Doju: gl
 Chkoupinator: yeah I saw that but I also saw python3 somewhere in the top 100
 Chkoupinator: so I thought maybe it'd be fine?
 Chkoupinator: thanks a lot btw :3
 llllllllll: for top 100, python should be enough
 Doju: Btw, are almost all of the top 100 seriously simulating?
 llllllllll: for top 10, possibly not
 AntiSquid: what is "seriously simulating"
 Doju: as opposed to non-seriously simulating
 Doju: no jk
 Doju: like it can't be that all of those people have coded that?
 Doju: isn't it pretty complicated?
 AntiSquid: ok whatever serious means, mine isn't serious yet, quite crappy bot at #50 and has bunch of annoying bugs i try to fix, does this help doju
 llllllllll: it is, but even I did it
 llllllllll: so it should be feasible
 Doju: how many lines for the simulating part llllllllll?
 Doju: just to give me a frame of reference
 Doju: AntiSquid yes it does help, thanks
 llllllllll: in python ~1000, but there are still some things not finished
 Doju: oh jeez
 Doju: i've 550 and i'm doing basically nothing
 Doju: a thousand more to that? ugh
 Doju: Or maybe i could leverage my existing classes
 Doju: throw a few parallel universes in there, AntiSquid 
 Doju: :p
 MSmits: it's weird, my bot hasnt changed in 2 days and it's still between 10 and 15 most of the time. 
 MSmits: I guess people dont improve that much outside of the weekend?
 llllllllll: i fell 150 places
 MSmits: I hope I am getting into legend on friday 
 llllllllll: so your code is good
 MSmits:  Ihate having to work past gold boss, it's hard
 llllllllll: ++
 MSmits: yeah it's ok, it does one thing really well
 MSmits: other than that it needs improvement
 MattSOrme: hmm. So i tried calculating routes from everywhere to everywhere, and i got through 83 positions in a second... thats not good enough
 MSmits: I am going to try to fix the corner chase problem and get some easy kill/survival on dead ends
 MSmits: MattSOrme which language?
 MattSOrme: python
 MSmits: yeah  on python it is hard to do this for two reasons
 Doju: What do you guys do to make it so slow lol
 MSmits: 1) it is slow to begin with, having an interpreter and not a compiler with optimizations
 Doju: Ohhh maybe you're doing the same thing that i did
 Doju: MattSOrme are you printing something out on every line?
 MSmits: 2) You dont have much insight in what is happening under the hood, so that you dont realize when something you do is really inefficient
 Doju: in your path calculating function
 MattSOrme: nah, only prints are once i time out 0.99 seconds
 Doju: i tried debugging my path precompute function and figuring out why it timed out
 Doju: added more prints
 Doju: timed out even more
 Doju: took me 2 hours lmao
 MSmits: One thing you can do MattSOrme, is instead of generating a list of neighbors, then iterating over that list, is generating all neighbors for all cells at turn 1 and then just using those lists on other turns
 Doju: yes MSmits that's a good one
 MSmits: also make sure you use the right data structures for your "explored cells"
 Doju: hm
 MSmits: you dont want that to be a list where you have to go through the entire list to find if something is in there
 Doju: i have that in the cells themselves
 MSmits: that works too
 MattSOrme: Another thought i just had was find all routes for ~50 random positions. Then later I can find route to a know anchor&#160;:/ 
 MSmits: that seems like an unnecessary solution
 MattSOrme: should i not be buildings lists and looking through?
 Doju: no
 MSmits: for neighbors you should
 Doju: if explrored
 MSmits: not for the explored part
 Doju: sets
 MSmits: your way is better than a set doju
 MSmits: keep a toggle on the cell object
 MSmits: "explored = true
 Doju: Oh is it? I thought it'd be slower
 Doju: that's nice to know
 MSmits: what you can also do is what i do in c++
 MSmits: I have an array explored[595]
 MattSOrme: So store a "False" grid, and set to true when i explore?
 MSmits: I memset the whole thing to 0 before bfs
 MSmits: each cell has an id
 MSmits: so i just do the array lookup to see if its set to true
 MSmits: MattSOrme yes thats exactly what i do
 Doju: Is a 2-dimensional array lookup really faster than a set lookup?
 MSmits: if you're using c++ and the dimension size is fixed and constant, it doesnt matter
 Doju: huh, okay
 MSmits: its going to view your array as a 1D array
 jrke: ya c++ for me
 MSmits: the 2D part is just visual for you
 jrke: how to predict best direction?
 Doju: jrke that's your job to figure out
 Uljahn: how to win the contest?
 Csipcsirip: isnt a 2d array an 1d array of 1d array pointers&#160;? 
 MSmits: no
 Csipcsirip: wow
 MSmits: a 2D array is just 1 pointer to the first element of the array, the way i do it
 MSmits: map[17][35] for example
 MSmits: thats just the same as map[595]
 Doju: oh huuuh
 Doju: that's smart
 Csipcsirip: hm good to know
 MSmits: its different when the size is variable
 Doju: i have it set up the way Csipcsirip does it
 Doju: or at least presented
 MSmits: you can do map + 20 and you will just get map[1][3]
 MSmits: well you will need to dereference in the first case if i got it correctly
 jrke: are there are only fixed map or generates new each time
 Doju: new one each time
 MSmits: each map has a seed
 AntiSquid: everytime MSmits gets asked a question, his teacher instincts kick in and he can't stop, Automaton2000
 MSmits: I like this seed:
 Automaton2000: i didn't think it would help if i can make it to legend
 MSmits: seed=7270017022198506500
 MSmits: you know me well AntiSquid
 jrke: so what can we get from seed is there any help from seed
 Doju: AntiSquid that's true and it's awesome
 Doju: thank you MSmits for being awesome
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: jrke you can watch a game with a certain property, note down the seed and use the seed with a different opponent
 MoMaT: Doju, in python your own indexing might be slower than a set of tuples. what MSmits is saiyng works great, but for C.
 MSmits: yes, do correct me if you have python knowledge... I only have a little
 Doju: MoMaT tuples won't work since i constantly mutate them
 Doju: waait no i dont
 Doju: i mutate the objects they refer to
 Uljahn: in python you can use numpy 2D arrays...
 Doju: oh shoot, what am i doing
 MSmits: Uljahn I've always wondered how those stack up against other language arrays' speeds
 jrke: hey is only right use of speed and switch can take us to silver
 MSmits: pretty sure they wont beat c++, but maybe comparable to C#/java?
 Doju: jrke i think you don't even need switch to get to silver
 Doju: or maybe not even speed if your bot is really efficient
 Uljahn: most of numpy is in c++, MSmits
 MSmits: I know, but its precompiled right?
 Uljahn: ye
 Doju: So um...
 MSmits: so it's not in relation to the rest of your code. Not flexible
 jrke: whats good speed or switch
 Doju: i have no idea what i should use now lmao
 MSmits: not sure how well c++ compilers do this
 Doju: maybe i'll just stick with my current thing until i hit performance issues
 MSmits: but in any case, all python users should numpy as much as possible I guess
 Doju: i don't use it at all atm
 MoMaT: for memory of "visits" use dictionary or set.
 jrke: fory switch their pac  guys in silver do they switch their pac type to DEAD:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 jrke: *for
 Doju: and performance is fine for now
 jrke: DOJU whats your rank in bronze
 Doju: 367 currently
 jrke: K
 Doju: soon to be better 
 Doju: a lot better i think
 MSmits: MoMaT that is faster than a list, but it is slower than a direct memory lookup, would they not be better off with an array that you dont have to iterate, but that has a direct lookup?
 jrke: me also submitted again before that it was 297
 Doju: wait are you using your super shallow depth simulation jrke?
 jrke: no 
 jrke: its timeout for that
 Doju: okay
 MSmits: for huge maps, you could not use direct lookup, but with at most 595 cells, why not just have 595 visit toggles
 jrke: now normal if i am not able to be in silver then i will try it again
 jrke: before silver opened my rank 700 and now 800+ in silver and i am 300 in bronze:stuck_out_tongue:
 MSmits: plenty of time left to experiment. If you intend to do more contests in the future, you could just try different ways of doing things and get better
 MSmits: good practice
 MSmits: and consider a promotion to silver a bonus on top of learning if it does happen
 jrke: yeah i am 13 years old and only spent 5 months on coding lot to explore
 MSmits: I started coding around 30 or so
 fasil: hey there
 MSmits: well serious coding that is
 jrke: hey how u collaborate with other pacs
 MSmits: randomly do simulations and see which combination of moves led to the best result
 jrke: but it gives time out in c++ i created nested loop
 MSmits: you need very high performance to get this to work
 MSmits: dont do recursion or anything, just randomly select moves and deal with moves that cause conflicts
 MSmits: two pacs going to the same cell, select one of them to stop
 jrke: what if i send my pac in other directions in starting
 MSmits: thats fine, just randomly pick moves
 jrke: K
 MSmits: they're going to do different things every time
 jrke: thanks MSmith\
 jrke:&#160;:-)
 Doju: BuT iT
 jrke:&#160;:)
 Doju: Is UnDeTerMeNiStIc
 Doju: :D
 MSmits: yeah... just dont spend days on this if you cant get it to work, it's not as easy as i now many it out to be. The move conflicts get complicated with speed
 MSmits: make it out ot be that is
 jrke: hey just type colon and closing ) and enter in chat box it will automatically chages to smile
 MSmits: and you get two pacs trying to exchange positions, moving through eachother. No move conflict there, but still not allowed 
 jrke: hey my collision are solved but they don't callobarate which other
 MSmits: ye, it's the hardest part and the only reason my bot is doing well.
 jrke: what u did i know you won't tell:)
 MSmits: no, i did tell... the monte carlo random moves is what does this. But the details of it I won't share no
 jrke: Whats monte carlo
 MSmits: random moves&#160;:)
 jrke: K
 MoMaT: MSmits, the thing is, if you use your own index arithmetic, it might be slower than heavily optimised native data structures. dictionaries are surprisingly fast in Python.
 jrke: who is first presently
 Doju: MoMat oh maybe that's why i haven't run in to performance issues
 Doju: I'm doing a lot of things with dicts
 jrke: main thing is Dist and collaboration
 MSmits: MoMaT sure that's possible, I have no idea how fast these things are in python
 MoMaT: I'm just saying, not many optimisation tricks in C apply to Python. best is to test with "timeit".
 MSmits: makes sense
 MoMaT: example timings -- adding values to list, set, and dictionary: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/LaXpMKvs">https://pastebin.com/LaXpMKvs</a>
 MSmits: hmm yes, but the most relevant part is the lookup
 MoMaT: sure, but you would never expect such close results from C++ STL for example.
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: they would be far apart
 Derthek: In the montecarlo, do you just pick moves that can be performed in this turn or any random move is fine?
 MSmits: allowed moves only
 MSmits: but you could be more strict than that and not allow all "allowed" moves
 Derthek: really nice, I will try implementing some montecarlo algorithm once the contest is over&#160;:)
 MSmits: for example, dont allow moves where pac 1 and pac 2 go to the same cell
 Derthek: yeah, that should not be a valid move ^^
 Doju: oh damn i have a bad flaw in my thing that i've been writing for the past hour...
 MSmits: never a good thing when you have a bad flaw in your thing
 MSmits: hard to find a doctor with time for you as well
 Doju: xD
 MSmits: easy way to practice monte carlo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-vs-zombies">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-vs-zombies</a>
 Doju: my Cells have a variable called "block" which can be 0 for a walkable thing, 1 for a wall, 2 for a friendly pac and 3 for an enemy 
 Derthek: Id love to know if you using some special hamiltonian or just pellet value
 Doju: oh wait nevermind
 Doju: it's not a flaw
 Doju: a cell can't be both a wall and a pac
 Doju: Btw how would you set the "blocking criteria" for a flood fill function
 Doju: if the cells have two attributes that can bock
 Doju: block*
 Doju: like flood(criteria = (wall == True, pac == True))
 Doju: but that's not gonna work
 MSmits: i just calculate whether an opponent pac has advantage in some way (considering cooldown and type) and if they do, then it's a wall in my sim
 Doju: yeah i didnt mean like the theory behind that but how it's actually written
 MSmits: well at risk of giving too much detail: Keep a tiny array on each cell object to state whether the cell is blocked for any particular pac of yours
 MSmits: blocked[5]
 Doju: that's pretty much what i'm doing at the moment
 MSmits: just make sure you reset it every turn
 Doju: oh wait no
 MSmits: as our code grows, you tend to forget small stuff like that and you get stuck for hours
 Doju: well kinda but anyways what if i sometimes want to check for both walls and pacs but sometimes only walls?
 MSmits: i have a separate property wall and blocked
 MSmits: well actually, i dont need the wall property as i keep a list of cell neighbors
 MSmits: so if its a wall it wont be in the list of neighbors
 MSmits: so i automatically ignore walls when finding a path and i can, if i want to, check for opponent blocks
 Doju: huh, my cell neighbors dont have that since i also use them for other things
 JohnCM: i have a different array to store the walls, and a different array for my pellets
 JohnCM: so i don't confuse myself
 Doju: okay
 MSmits: i dont know why you would ever include walls in your neighbors list
 Doju: actually now that i think of it i don't know why i'm doing that either MSmits
 Doju: hahah
 Doju: the other thing also checks for walls and gets rid of them
 MSmits: hehe good luck improving that. gotta go do some stuff now&#160;:)
 MSmits: ttyl
 Doju: alright thankss
 RoboStac: MoMaT - that benchmark doesn't show anything useful as you don't clear the dict / set / list so the list continues to grow to 1000 * 10000 long and other than the first run you only time set / dict lookups
 MoMaT: that's what I thought too. I was lazy and use single line timeit without setup. I got similar results when cleared...
 Uljahn: also the faster way is: "arr = np.zeros(1000); a[:] = True" or even "arr = np.ones(1000)" :smiley:
 Doju: nice, at least i haven't broken my code by chanigng a bunch of things
 Doju: that's always good to know&#160;:)
 MoMaT: yes, if you set the entire vector at once. but if you loop, and add elements one by one, it would be slower than lists.
 Doju: say that i have a "visited" array like that using numpy
 Doju: if i want to reset the array
 Doju: would it be faster to the np.zeros thing
 Doju: actually nevermind
 Doju: yes it would be faster xD
 wlesavo: Doju i think there are even faster ways to do so, but i dont think that it is the slowest part of code anyway 
 Doju: yeah it was only a performance issue when i ran it wayyy too many times
 Doju: although, say, hypothetically, if i wanted to calculate all the distances again every move, that'd be a thing to consider
 Doju: wink win
 Doju: wink wink
 Doju: if there was maayybee some math magic that would be useful
 Doju: Lol my pacs are so stupid atm
 Doju: enemy was just in front of me and at a corner
 Doju: Enemy is not visible anymore? Must have vanished out of existence then.
 MoMaT: robostack, just because I like you :P more tests for you (and Uljahn): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/arukosemuz.bash">https://hastebin.com/arukosemuz.bash</a>
 Uljahn:&#160;:/
 Uljahn: "for i in range(100): a[i] = 1" you are measuting iteration here, just use vectorized a[:] = 1 or a.fill(1)
 MoMaT: that's a typo, should've been a[i] = I, as I want to store different elements.
 MoMaT: *a[i] = I
 MoMaT: sorry, autocorrection knows better...
 Uljahn: then a = np.arange(100, dtype=int) would be better
 wlesavo: Uljahn he is talking about looping over np arrays, that make sence, obviously for this simple example there are better ways to do so 
 Uljahn: you should avoid iterating through numpy arrays with python at all cost
 wlesavo: this was his point i think :slight_smile:
 Uljahn: ye, choosing the wrong tool
 MoMaT: sure, but you taking it to literally. we were talking about remembering visited nodes.
 MoMaT: there is no vector to store, just one value at a time. and there is no sequence either...
 Uljahn: preallocating an array in numpy costs nothing, but adding elements to lists, sets, dicts requires much work under the hood
 Uljahn: such is the difference between static and dynamic data structures
 MoMaT: well, theoretically yes. but look at the timings. dictionaries beat everything for small N.
 Uljahn: sure
 AlexRSS: Any tips on testing optimisation in this interface?
 Doju: AlexRSS not sure if it's the best way but i printed out all the inputs, copied them
 Doju: then made a generator function that acts as input()
 Doju: and profiled it locally
 AlexRSS: I've done that kinda, which is why I'm confused
 AlexRSS: I;ve got a function which when run in the IDE times me out
 AlexRSS: Outside of the IDE it runs in less than a millisecond
 Doju: hmm
 Doju: that's odd
 AlexRSS: This is running on first turn so I should have 1000ms to play with
 Doju: Are you sure it's doing the exact same thing?
 AlexRSS: Yep
 Doju: bizzarre
 Doju: bizarre*
 Uljahn: using flush=True in your debug printing in browser IDE?
 AlexRSS: I'm basically saying "If pacs can see no pellets, have them navigate to the four corners as backup inputs"
 AlexRSS: The function is checking the four corner inputs against the current map to make sure they're valid inputs
 AlexRSS: How do I use flush=True?
 MoMaT: inside print function, as argument.
 Uljahn: print(my_var, file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Uljahn: so you'll recieve the output even when timeouted
 AlexRSS: Cheers, I'll give that a go
 MadKnight: basically python caches output instead of sending it right away
 MoMaT: if you have a weird timeout, its most likely infinite loop.
 Icebox: ah I remember that tip saving my ass like 4 years ago after I spent 3h debugging my timeouts Uljahn :D
 Icebox: and so have my prints have been flushed ever since
 Uljahn: ye, deserves to be in faq
 Icebox: we should make a language specific FAQ
 wlesavo: i would put fflush in stub if it would be possible
 Uljahn: good point
 MoMaT: the Python environment could be set to flush stderr by default. someone suggested it already on the forum.
 wlesavo: also spend quite some time trying to figure out why was the last input missing
 Astrobytes: Yea Robo posted about it, Thibaud was gonna suggest to the devs
 Astrobytes: It's probably the most common Python issue people seem to have on CG
 Clagus: lol, I just got a tie as a battle result
 Clagus: didn't know that was possible
 AlexRSS: So that's helped me figure out which run it's failing on
 AlexRSS: But I still don't understand what is making it take so long
 Earthborne: Gosh thanks Uljahn for the flush tip, I've been banging my head all day not finding where I time out!
 AlexRSS: Bah, will time.time() outputs work alright in CG if I import it?
 Doju: AlexRSS are you printing a bunch of stuff?
 AlexRSS: Nope
 Doju: alright, that was my problem while i tried to "debug" my distance precompute function xD
 AlexRSS: Only printing being done is 5 lines of  debug
 Doju: alright
 AlexRSS: Everything else is just writing to/modifying lists for later use
 solaimanope: Gold league will be unlocked in 4 hours right?
 Illedan: yes
 Uljahn: AlexRSS, im using this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e0a18ff4-95d0-49c7-acc3-2affe55a0256">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e0a18ff4-95d0-49c7-acc3-2affe55a0256</a>
 AlexRSS: Thanks&#160;:-)
 AlexRSS: Okay, that was actually very helpful
 AlexRSS: It looks like the issue was actually coming from writing the map to a list
 AlexRSS: That's taking 4000 ms
 Doju: oh this is beautiful
 Doju: pacs considering other pacs as walls looks sooo much better
 Doju: although sometimes they take stupid routes when they could just wait a turn or two...
 AlexRSS: At what point does the game start counting for timeout?
 Earthborne: After first input
 Uljahn: ^
 AlexRSS: Because this 3000 ms delay is coming from the inbuilt code to read the map from input
 Earthborne: I think someone said
 AlexRSS: It's timing out before I get to make my first input though
 Earthborne: Is timeit reliable when used in the online IDE?
 Uljahn: yep
 Earthborne: And the turn limit is 50 ms=
 AlexRSS: It says in the specs
 AlexRSS: Response time for the first turn â¤ 1000ms
 AlexRSS: But the inbuilt game code is taking longer than that to run
 AlexRSS: So i've got  no clue how to debug this
 Uljahn: what's the inbuild code?
 AlexRSS: width, height = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 AlexRSS: According to timeit that takes 3841.825 ms to run
 Uljahn: just start the timer right after this line
 Doju: Oh wow yeah this definitely helped with the ranking
 Doju: might go to silver with this
 Doju: why haven't i done this earlier ._.
 Doju: oh okay i'm the top player in bronze
 AlexRSS: Found the bugger
 Doju: sure i'll take it xD
 Doju: nice AlexRSS
 AlexRSS: Got an infinite loop in the coord checking
 Doju: what was it?
 Doju: ah
 Earthborne: Great to lurk in the chat, this discussion really helps my debugging as well :D
 AlexRSS: The check scans across the row and if it gets to the middle without finding a valid space, it's meant to increment the y value and start again
 AlexRSS: What's actually happening is that it just jumps infinitely between 16 and 17
 AlexRSS: All of that, because I forgot to set the midpoint to int(width/2) rather than width/2
 AlexRSS: I'm going to go have a quick cry-break
 AlexRSS: :joy:
 DomiKo: do someone know what happens if there are two shortest paths?
 NickStahl: Doju what was your main change to get through bronze?
 NickStahl: I'm still to lazy to write a sim, so I'm just doing some heuristics but not sure if that will get me to silver.
 Doju: NickStahl I made pacs consider other pacs as walls
 MSmits: dont do that when you know your pac has advantage based on type and cooldown
 Doju: hm
 Doju: okay, i'll add that to the to-do-list
 MSmits: it's not critical but helps
 AlexRSS: What's the output to move a pac and activate speed?
 AlexRSS: Or can you only do one per turn?
 Doju: only one per turn
 RockyMullet: Doju you probably miss some kills because of that
 Doju: RockyMullet my pacs are pacifists anyways
 RockyMullet: or avoid a pac ou shouldnt avoid
 Doju: that is true though
 RockyMullet: Doju there always those suicidal pacs you throw themselves at you :P
 MSmits: I think you cant avoid having two types of code, one to optimize pellet gathering and one to kill and avoid other pacs
 RockyMullet: you gotta let them
 MSmits: the hard part is combining the two
 NickStahl: Tx for the answer Doju
 Doju: np
 Clagus: YES! SILVER LEAGUE FINALLY! xD sorry for spam :P
 MSmits: well done
 Clagus: thx :D
 Clagus: implementing BFS helped :P
 MSmits: yea it does
 Kellthazar: Today Ill try to apply a Monte Carlo approach to my bot.
 Kellthazar: Find a paper about Monte Carlo Plan on RTS games that I think that fits with this contest.
 Kellthazar: Found*
 Doju: Cool Kellthazar
 Derthek: Could you share that paper? I am interested on it as well :D
 Schade: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~jonathan/publications/ai_publications/mcsearch.pdf">https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~jonathan/publications/ai_publications/mcsearch.pdf</a>&#160;?
 MSmits: title sounds perfect for this yes
 Derthek: thanks!
 Schade: confirm with Kellthazar if it's the good one&#160;:)
 Schade: Do you need a simulation of the game for the Montecarlos renforcement learning ,
 Schade:&#160;?
 NormantasStankevicius: forgot to say, congrats Doju getting to silver
 MSmits: ok, first of all, it's not reinforcement learning I think Schade
 Doju: Thanks NormantasStankevicius
 MSmits: unless it's something else entirelty
 Doju: Next goal: gold :P
 MSmits: and you *always* need a simulation
 Schade: Is there a simulator on the spring contest&#160;?
 MSmits: for anything
 NormantasStankevicius: last contest gold for me was hell
 MSmits: even basic heuristic bots will simulate something
 Schade: an external environment simulator if you prefer
 Uljahn: you can use the referee
 MSmits: oh, no not really, but you can steal the source code
 MSmits: = referee
 Uljahn: link is in the rules
 Derthek: How do you use the referee?
 Schade: ah yes&#160;! merci
 MSmits: usually it is poorly optimized though
 MSmits: also you might want to simplify parts of the simulation
 MSmits: Derthek the referee is mostly to gain insight in implementation detaikls
 MSmits: what happens when two pacs enter the same cell and such
 MSmits: but the description covers most of this pretty well
 MSmits: i barely looked at the referee
 Derthek: aah ok
 MSmits: in some games you really need to study it
 MSmits: for example CSB simulations
 MSmits: though other players have figured out and shared simulation details for that
 Derthek: CSB?
 MSmits: grid games like this, you usually dont need to bother looking at it
 Schade: it's why I asked for external simuiator&#160;:)
 MSmits: coders strike back, physics racing game
 Schade: Is there a way to add macro on VIM integrated plugin&#160;?
 Schade: or Is there a config file for VI editor&#160;?
 IAmNoob: hi:)
 Uljahn: you mean for Monaco IDE editor?
 Schade: no I mean for VIM edition mode
 anid: Gold opening tonight?
 ZarthaxX: 3 hs
 AntiSquid: hi i am new, when is gold opening?
 Schade: ohh gold is not opening&#160;? oh I'm not so late ^^
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid yesterday
 anid: ZarthaxX where can you find the clock for league opening?
 ZarthaxX: there isnt one
 ZarthaxX: but it's always at that time
 Uljahn: it's the same time the contest opened i guess
 anid: But how did u find out which day?
 AntiSquid: you have to track it, just like hidden info games
 Schade: Anyone used VIM mode editor&#160;? If yes, do you know if I can add some map&#160;?
 AntiSquid: day is actually in the IDE, when you click on rank, idk maybe there should be a faq somewhere?
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 anid: Hmm, so there is only 1--2 days with a legend league?
 AntiSquid: 2+ 
 MSmits: it doesn't matter, we're already fighting the same players
 MSmits: therÃ©s just other players also
 anid: Yes
 AntiSquid: a lot more quitters this time
 AntiSquid: but few new people 
 Ramzel: How to use speed ability and switch type?
 IAmNoob: std::cout&lt;&lt;"SPPED "&lt;&lt;pacID&lt;&lt;" | ";
 IAmNoob: output SPEED
 IAmNoob: than pacID
 Ramzel: Thanks
 IAmNoob: np
 Ramzel: and how to Switch?
 AntiSquid: i think finally solved some really disgusting bug, but will wait for gold now to open, Automaton2000 cheer me up
 Schade: otherwise your read rules&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: dont forget to ouput" | "
 Automaton2000: i'm doing this for a while
 AntiSquid: bronze only top 200 promoted, wonder if it's worse for gold
 AntiSquid: :D
 JohnCM: haha when is gold coming ou
 JohnCM: out
 eulerscheZahl: i predict 50-100
 eulerscheZahl: in 3h
 AntiSquid: ya was thinking 50 too ugh
 JohnCM: i see.. wonder if i'll make it
 JohnCM: will know tmr
 JohnCM: have a good day everyone
 AntiSquid: bye
 eulerscheZahl: you would even have a good rank for a boss
 eulerscheZahl: and python too. that's an advantage if you want to be the boss
 AntiSquid: lol, would be hard to predict as a boss, the bot in the arena does some weird shit
 AntiSquid: ah wait whom you talking to&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: john
 AntiSquid: ah ya i guess
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't check the actual bot, just the rank
 wlesavo: AntiSquid also have a good rank for a boss :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: silver boss with smilies would be nice
 wlesavo: nah, thay will cut it
 wlesavo: they
 AntiSquid: lame&#160;:(
 wlesavo: true
 JohnCM: anyway you also won't know who is chosen as the boss
 AntiSquid: euler i see mataranga / Febrin / robo closest to 100 
 JohnCM: but if it's my own code I'm pretty sure i can beat it with a few tweaks
 AntiSquid: maybe robo even has clearner code? :thinking:
 JohnCM: i realise i have two systems in my code
 JohnCM: each taking 400 lines
 JohnCM: but i don't use the first system anymore
 JohnCM: so actually i can shorten it to 400 lines
 eulerscheZahl: but we don't know if they will go for top100 or even above
 JohnCM: lol.. but i keep it there for legacy
 AntiSquid: wlesavo for silver lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'm beyond 1.2k already. could do some cleanup but now below 1k :D
 AntiSquid: just under 1k here
 AntiSquid: repetitive code though
 JohnCM: yup if i do more recursion i could probably make it 300
 JohnCM: but this is not a contest about neat code
 JohnCM: so yea.. haha
 AntiSquid: what are the chances they go again for 200&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: :thumbsdown:
 eulerscheZahl: probably after some more promotions at the edge of the leagues
 dbdr: did they actuall pick 200 for silver, or it was just the drip promotion?
 AntiSquid: 200
 dbdr: it went up super fast
 AntiSquid: they said they will increase it later, slowly ... but i didn't see any actual mass promotion after that
 eulerscheZahl: but it was a really smooth opening of a large league
 dbdr: it did increase to 450 in a short time. 
 dbdr: maybe it was partly that
 dbdr: but weird with the few matches
 dbdr: and the broken bots
 dbdr: :D
 AntiSquid: was top 20 initially because of that
 AntiSquid: but wanted to experiment with some stuff so ...
 dbdr: top 20 in silver? :D
 dbdr: silver is the new legend
 JohnCM: that's a massive cut
 eulerscheZahl: with crashing bots
 eulerscheZahl: DEAD
 JohnCM: i think maybe this time legend can go for top 10
 AntiSquid: yes with the crashing bots around got to top 20
 dbdr: I predict large gold and small legend
 eulerscheZahl: medium gold + small legend
 dbdr: CG is&#160;% 2
 JohnCM: small gold + tiny legend
 Xlos: small gold + huge legend
 JohnCM: haha
 wlesavo: AntiSquid i wouldnt really mind to be a boss :slight_smile: but 40 seems to small for gold and i dont want to resubmit :slight_smile:
 dbdr: all silver directly in legend, and super hard gold boss
 dbdr: that would be fun
 JohnCM: time to make your code weaker then
 JohnCM: so the boss will be easier
 JohnCM: haha i really didn't know the players' bots are the bronze/silver/gold bosses
 JohnCM: i thought there was a benchmark already set out in advance
 wlesavo: nah, its weak enough, i can resubmit same code to #140
 eulerscheZahl: i was the gold boss in botters of the galaxy
 JohnCM: how would you know?
 dbdr: because of the bugs&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: play me vs bossand codingame told me
 wlesavo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: then double hulk appeared and crushed me
 JohnCM: anyway whoever is the bronze boss in "ghost in the cell" is so hard
 eulerscheZahl: and i ignored groots
 eulerscheZahl: ghost in the cell has weak bosses
 JohnCM: massive difficulty increase from the grass levels
 dbdr: there was acheese like sending groots around the sides
 eulerscheZahl: perform a range attack and groots will come to kill the closest player
 eulerscheZahl: and i ignored them, was easy to kill me
 dbdr: ah yes, bait them to attack the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: i was well aware of that bug but didn't care as i didn't expect to become the boss
 JohnCM: haha maybe i haven't tried hard enough for it then
 AntiSquid: botg multi is strange with small gold league
 dbdr: maybe it helped me get my first legend eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you missed legend in your first contest
 eulerscheZahl: but was a tough one for new players
 dbdr: yeah, MM, was top gold. didn't know what a sim was&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: not a single tshirt winner (top20) was a first-time winner
 wlesavo: wow
 eulerscheZahl: usually it's about 50-50
 eulerscheZahl: mean max was really hard for new users. those with CSB experience had an advantage
 eulerscheZahl: just too chaotic to get much done with heuristics
 JohnCM: i think codingame is moving into multiagent games more and more
 JohnCM: i think it is a good trend. it is hard to find good heuristics there
 JohnCM: like 1v1 games like checkers have multiple good approaches to solve them already
 Chkoupinator: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
 Chkoupinator: I think I'm giving up on trying to solve this with C++
 IAmNoob: you could try just using the "new" keyword
 IAmNoob: and delete
 IAmNoob: it is easier
 Chkoupinator: damnit
 Chkoupinator: everything I made is using shared pointers
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: it is not a problem
 IAmNoob: but in future it will be harder
 IAmNoob: try dynamic allocation
 Chkoupinator: I don't even know what's causing the error
 Chkoupinator: isn't shared pointers dynamic allocation by itself?
 IAmNoob: I think those pointers
 IAmNoob: Chkoupinator not everytime
 Chkoupinator: I'm using make_shared to instantiate things instead of new
 Chkoupinator: which is supposed to be best practice
 IAmNoob: not he best
 IAmNoob: i will recomand new and delete
 IAmNoob: are more flexible\
 IAmNoob: but it is you time to chose
 pmor: you only want shared_ptrs if you want ref-counting...otherwise use make_unique
 IAmNoob: unique pointers are a good idea
 Counterbalance: bad alloc is when you allocate too much memory
 Chkoupinator: how much is too much
 Counterbalance: -1
 Counterbalance: 768mb is the max (this includes the executable, stack etc..)
 AntiSquid: 300 more participants and this contest beats the accountant too :o
 eulerscheZahl: and the number for TAC is a lie
 AntiSquid: yes but it would be amazing if it even beats that lie
 Chkoupinator: I don't understand what's causing the memory hog
 Chkoupinator: and I suppose there are no tools to help me with that?
 IAmNoob: no tools
 IAmNoob: you can try to delete the pointer
 pmor: if you can run locally, visual studio has a memory profiler
 IAmNoob: 's*
 IAmNoob: or to try unique pointers
 Chkoupinator: I'll need some decoy input tho
 Chkoupinator: nah with unique it's worse
 Chkoupinator: they get deleted when they become out of scope
 pmor: if you have allocated memory existing out of scope, that's a leak 
 Chkoupinator: isn't the point of using make_shared automatical destruction?
 Chkoupinator: automatic* 
 pmor: you want make_shared if there are going to be multiple owners of the pointer
 Chkoupinator: I store everything in an array so that I can use the "fringe" of the current depth in the next depth
 pmor: then when the last owner goes out of scope, the memory is deleted
 Chkoupinator: ^ which should happen only when moving to another pacman in my code
 Chkoupinator: but so far I didn't solve even wood league so idk
 Chkoupinator: feelsbad
 Chkoupinator: I think I'll move back to python I'm tired of C++
 Chkoupinator: and the integrated IDE doesn't help at all
 pmor: sounds like you don't have the lifetimes and ownerships structured properly
 Chkoupinator: I honestly don't know and I don't even feel like looking at it anymore
 Chkoupinator: even though it's properly written it feels like I'm so wrong that it'll need a full rewrite
 Chkoupinator: and I really don't feel like doing that for now
 Chkoupinator: is python any viable or should I give up and be done with it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess I'm not getting out of bronze
 eulerscheZahl: depends on what you want to do with python
 Doju: How many different constants do you guys have?
 Doju: i currently have 1 and i can't even get that to the best value
 Doju: and in my next plan i'd have like 10
 eulerscheZahl: like magic constants of my own for scoring?
 eulerscheZahl: or game constants too like 5 pacmen max per team
 Doju: magic constants for your scoring or decision making anyways
 eulerscheZahl: 5 i think
 Chkoupinator: eulerscheZahl I honestly don't even know what I'm doing anymore
 Chkoupinator: I was trying to do some simple search with a static depth and move according to which gives most point
 Chkoupinator: points*
 eulerscheZahl: for simulation python is a bad choice it's just slow
 Chkoupinator: then I guess I'll just give up
 JohnCM: well i got to top 100 with python
 JohnCM: it is a viable language
 JohnCM: just not for monte carlo
 JohnCM: you have to use breadth first search to enumerate the value of various paths
 Chkoupinator: that's what I was trying to use in C++
 Chkoupinator: but I ended up with memory issues somehow
 JohnCM: and you need to cleverly go for the big pellets
 JohnCM: that is a key thing for victory
 Chkoupinator: yeah I think I'll do that instead
 JohnCM: focus pathfinding on the big pellet first
 JohnCM: then when it is gone then it is free for all
 MattSOrme: I can't seem to find an answer to what direction CG chooses when dist is the same. 
 JohnCM: you also have to prioritize your various pacs
 JohnCM: which is nearer to the pellet etc.
 JohnCM: don't all go for one big pellet
 JohnCM: that will lead to congestion
 Chkoupinator: yeah that should be easy
 Chkoupinator: I already was preparing for that in C++
 JohnCM: another key concept: spread out your forces
 JohnCM: how you do it is up to you
 Chkoupinator: thanks 
 JohnCM: but good algo always has the pacs far from each other
 JohnCM: no point covering the same area twice
 WINWINWIN: JohnCM if you try your own pathfinding for super pellets, wont the opponent get it first?
 JohnCM: think of how to implement it
 Doju: Not always JohnCM
 Chkoupinator: I had just deleted my python project and you gave me hope again :3
 Doju: you could argue for an aggressive strategy where you trap pacs
 JohnCM: the opponent can get to the big pellet first
 WINWINWIN: Doesnt make a difference for me :D I dont know pathfinding
 Doju: and kill them
 JohnCM: then you either let him have it
 JohnCM: or you go near it and hope he doesn't get it
 JohnCM: some even kill at the big pellet
 JohnCM: i know my algo is weak against that
 eulerscheZahl: MattSOrme 03:59PMI can't seem to find an answer to what direction CG chooses when dist is the same. 
 WINWINWIN: Ok, so far I have been focussing on the big pellets above all, looks wrong
 JohnCM: big pellets can get you so much only
 JohnCM: after that it is the middle game
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 JohnCM: where you need to focus on optimizing your paths
 JohnCM: note i say paths
 JohnCM: because you need to optimize ALL your pacs
 Doju: wdym you cant make a big pac train?
 Doju: next meta
 JohnCM: if one pac goes the wrong way or just gets "lost", you lose a lot of pts
 JohnCM: and in the top few bots, every move counts
 JohnCM: and yea the next pointer will be "SPEED"
 JohnCM: use it all the time when you're not in danger
 JohnCM: means your pathfinding algo must output two steps in advance
 JohnCM: hope this helps
 JohnCM: gd luck
 Chkoupinator: btw in the map input there is only ' ' and '#' right?
 Doju: yup
 eulerscheZahl: and \n
 Doju: ah yeah
 Chkoupinator: thanks
 SurajMishra2209: what is the rank required for silver league?
 Doju: SurajMishra2209 above the boss
 SurajMishra2209: got it...tks
 wlesavo: ,
 Kiripot: lol
 wlesavo: ,,,,,,,,,,,,
 wlesavo: oh sry
 WINWINWIN: 3 more guys going to silver
 llllllllll: top 10% will go to gold?
 llllllllll: at 6 o clock, right?
 IAmNoob: no rank
 eulerscheZahl: sounds about right
 H1ggsb0s0n: so there's no boss bot for promotion to gold&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: not yet
 llllllllll: after 6, there will be
 dbf: top 11% will be better
 H1ggsb0s0n: ah, 
 eulerscheZahl: in 1.5h (as i don't know your timezone)
 JohnCM: exciting:)
 H1ggsb0s0n: thanks! I slacked after being promoted to silver and delayed any improvements to the bot until Thursday
 H1ggsb0s0n: thought I missed my chances to go to gold
 MattSOrme: if they could promote top 350, thatd be great&#160;;)
 llllllllll: haha, they won't
 MattSOrme: its alright, im re-writing half my stuff, to try and level up
 ChooJeremy: I don't think it matters if you delay
 ChooJeremy: they'll just assign a bot for gold and if you beat it anytime after you get promoted
 MattSOrme: finding so many silly bugs, but for all i know, those bugs helped haha
 JohnCM: hi jeremy, i just realized you're from NUS too
 llllllllll: I had the same: I fixed 2-3 real bugs (incorrect calculations, etc) and I lost ~200 positions
 llllllllll: I was like&#160;???
 ChooJeremy: Oh hello JohnCM, I just realised that too xd
 Doju: Same. My distance to cells was actually about the distance ^ 2
 Doju: not sure why that helped
 Doju: oh wait, yes i do
 Doju: not gonna tell you :P
 JohnCM: haha is this your first competition jeremy?
 ChooJeremy: Yup, was actually bored and just randomly stumbled upon this site after exams about a week ago
 MattSOrme: Its my first time playing at the same time, and im a bit obsessed
 MattSOrme: But i still have a day job to do as well
 JohnCM: same here
 JohnCM: i found out about this site via kaggle actually
 JohnCM: i was submitting for the ConnectX simulation, then noticed a link here. glad i checked it out. it's been great
 Hjax: did they fix the exploits in connectx yet? 
 JohnCM: nah
 Hjax: amazing 
 JohnCM: top two still winning via glitches
 JohnCM: i used monte carlo tree search, now about 20th place
 JohnCM: still haven't worked on implementing alphazero yet
 JohnCM: but it'll be done soon
 JohnCM: but it's more fun here haha. though not deep learning but still pretty fun still
 ChooJeremy: Cool, took a look at connectx, looks like a pretty similar competition
 JohnCM: that one can't beat this site in terms of feedback
 JohnCM: you get 50+ games played out within 5 minutes here
 JohnCM: amazing servers
 jrke: servers are boosting
 JohnCM: sometimes i wonder how the game is played out so fast. 1 sec per move, 200 moves, but you get the result in 5 sec
 Chkoupinator: pellets can only have a value of 1 or 10 right?
 jrke: ya
 JohnCM: yup
 jrke: 1 or 10
 MattSOrme: 50ms per move JohnCM after first move
 jrke: but input also takes time
 WINWINWIN: whats alphazero?
 ChooJeremy: That's true
 MattSOrme: Assuming they call both bots at the same time, 20 turns a second after first turn. so 5-10 seconds for 100-200 rounds
 ChooJeremy: at 50ms per move @ 200 moves that's 10 seconds per game
 jrke: ya 
 DollarAkshay: Not everyone really uses the whole 50ms
 MattSOrme: silver players prob are
 DollarAkshay: Naa
 DollarAkshay: 10 ms 
 DollarAkshay: Simple haeuristics bot
 MattSOrme: then you win the prize of waiting less time
 WINWINWIN: @DollarAkshay if they use a simulation wouldnt they need the full 50ms?
 jrke: hey DollarAkshay sup
 DollarAkshay: You can check Euler's bot hes printing his time
 jrke: ya some players are also printing time 
 DollarAkshay: @WINWINWIN Yeah, but most of them are just using heuristisc
 drykberg: sup guys... i geth "has not provided 1 lines in time" since i made 5 if statements that check for visible_pac_count and produce the corresponding amount of printf statements...
 eulerscheZahl: at least if i manage to print it in time...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462746991">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462746991</a>100ms for tracking alone :scream:
 WINWINWIN: :D 100ms?
 JohnCM: ah i see...
 MikeHoward1: My gameplay window keeps stopping &amp; not loading new "Play my code". Have to reload the page to fix. Is there a better way to fix? (Firefox.)
 drykberg: what the hell am i doin wrong
 JohnCM: yea makes sense
 JohnCM: 100ms
 JohnCM: i confused it for 1 sec per move
 eulerscheZahl: 100ms. that's why i lost the match&#160;:(
 jrke:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: had a huge lead by points already
 njaber: eulerscheZahl how are you doing the tracking?
 njaber: I've worked on a tracking algorithm for way too long, curious to see if you did it differently
 eulerscheZahl: see opponent in turn X and later in Y again
 njaber: mine runs in decent times
 JohnCM: hmm.. euler looks like you may need to do fewer sims
 JohnCM: if not losing by timeout is a pity
 jrke: hey you can add some functions before input its not counted
 njaber: Oh so you don't complete possible poses inbetween?
 eulerscheZahl: list all possible paths that lead from the first to the second positionand that's slow
 njaber: I basically complete the paths with new nodes each turn
 jrke: is it good if i choose path best  for next 4 turns
 eulerscheZahl: i partially do that too: try to guess the current location based on the past
 njaber: that way the calculations are done on a longer period, and I take into account line of sight, pellets taken etc.
 eulerscheZahl: in some corner cases it's even possible to deduct the actual position that way
 eulerscheZahl: so i have 2 trackers
 kovi: same here...
 jrke: how many lines of code do you have
 eulerscheZahl: but the first one failed here
 eulerscheZahl: 1250
 kovi: i dont try all paths though, its quickly become useless
 njaber: I've got 1750, I've been coding way too much since the beginning of the challenge
 jrke: i have only 300
 eulerscheZahl: i trim some paths too
 jrke: thats why my rank&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but here it's not enough
 MattSOrme: *sigh. My code is borked somewhere
 njaber: I don't really try all paths, I actually merge them into paths that end on the same node, and keep track of the minimum and maximum lengths of the paths, which is enough to deduce all other info back
 eulerscheZahl: and if i assume that it will be too much, i just skip the tracking
 eulerscheZahl: no point in computing the last 20 turns for my opponent
 wlesavo: euler you dont need the tracking to be perfect though, unlike ooc
 eulerscheZahl: but it would help for sure
 njaber: I still like to keep track of where the opponent CANNOT be
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes you can remove some pellets without seeing them
 JohnCM: like for dead ends i guess
 JohnCM: my code doesn't do that though, i want to be as optimistic as possible for the endgame
 dbf: yes, I'm trying to remove pellets based on opponent pack locations now, but it works only for some trivial cases
 jrke: hey you all will laugh after listening what happened with me before silver opened my rank 800 in bronze and now 898 in silver and i am still in bronze 
 dbf: don't want to use any probability maps, so trying to remove pellets only if it is 100% not avaialbe
 njaber: I don't do any probabilities, I only check possibility/impossibility rn
 wlesavo: jrke well you still need to get better to pass the boss, you wont promote by others leaving
 eulerscheZahl: but some cells are more likely than others
 jrke: yes i am doing well
 JohnCM: true that
 njaber: Yeah but I still haven't implemented anything that deals with probability
 JohnCM: i guess if you truly want to map the opponent's moves, it is possible but you will have a probability map
 JohnCM: using bayes' method
 JohnCM: but haha too much work for 50ms
 njaber: Doing bayes all the way would be too inefficient I think
 njaber: yeah
 JohnCM: well i would say kovi's exploration algo is quite good, and i don't think he tracks the opp much and he's doing well
 JohnCM: so.. exploration is key in this comp
 jrke: hey any suggestion how to collaborate with my pacs
 JohnCM: well i haven't implemented anti-ambush algo yet, so still ways to go for my code
 JohnCM: i keep getting killed at the super pellet
 njaber: I'm trying an other approach that relies way less on exploration, it's doing very poor rn, but I hope it can become quite good once I add a few upgrades
 JohnCM: @jrke, for starters, get your pacs to different regions of the map
 JohnCM: how you split the region is up to you
 jrke: K
 JohnCM: and never assign them to the same square
 JohnCM: basically don't self-sabo and collide yourself
 jrke: ya that i have
 JohnCM: that is totally preventable
 JohnCM: how to spread your pacs out is an art
 jrke: i got an idea now
 JohnCM: can't share too much because this is the crux of the competition
 JohnCM: if your spreading algo is better, you'll win
 jrke: it just clicked my mind thanks
 JohnCM: np
 Nerchio: gold in 1h?
 wlesavo: time to start resubmiting
 Nerchio: what do you mean
 Nerchio: leave me alone haha
 Nerchio: i got a lucky 29th spot i want to keep it
 wlesavo: same here :slight_smile:
 drykberg: what to do if pacs block each other? ^^
 H1ggsb0s0n: It depends
 H1ggsb0s0n: Your pacs shouldn't block each other by design because they should include each other's preferences when choosing a path
 drykberg: i dont have path finding 
 H1ggsb0s0n: if an enemy blocks your path you can retaliate and change your type to eat the enemy
 drykberg: im not that high up yet
 jrke: drykberg which league
 drykberg: wood
 jrke: wood2 or wood1
 eulerscheZahl: just ignore blocking
 dbf: can't tune scoring function to work well on short distance and capture far 10-point pellets the same time, looks like a time for hardcoding&#160;:)
 Doju: for wood even just checking if they're stuck will suffice
 drykberg: all i got is index of coordinates ranked by value
 eulerscheZahl: same dbf :D
 drykberg: and for loop for multiple pacs
 eulerscheZahl: the big pellet gives 30 points for me :D
 jrke: ignore collision for wood 1
 drykberg: well in the old wood league, where you had 1 pac. they automatically changed direction
 drykberg: now they just get stuck
 wlesavo: euler lol thats the same thing i come up with, manually increasing the score of big pellets 
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, lol, maybe should try, it is only 15 in my code&#160;:)
 jrke: which league you are in wood 1 or wood 2 confirm drykberg
 drykberg: wood 1
 eulerscheZahl: interesting. i'm not the only weirdo doing hacky things here
 jrke: K
 eulerscheZahl: i still feel like i should find a better scoring instead
 MattSOrme: if (wanted_to_move and didnt_move): target=randomDone
 jrke: so just give output of any visible pellet for each pac its enough to be in bronze
 dbf: I don't want to build too long pathes but on some maps large pellets are far away and my pathfinding is broken
 kovi: 15 for me
 jrke: and yes don,t chose same pellet for 2 pacs drykberg
 eulerscheZahl: my path finding is fine. bu the scoring for my final position isn't
 drykberg: yes, they get different pellets
 drykberg: but if their paths cross, they are screwed
 dbf: I have max_length in my path, is not enough sometimes )
 jrke: kovi kovi kovi when you open leaderboard only one name
 eulerscheZahl: get a bigger monitor jrke
 jrke: means didn't get u euler
 drykberg: all i wanna do is tell them to turn around 
 wlesavo: or become #1
 Doju: Ok i'm still not sure why the bug made my bot better
 Doju: but i'm gonna reintroduce it :D
 Doju: temporarily
 llllllllll: tfw my bot ran for 71ms and didnt get stopped
 jrke: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: is it me of is the forum down?
 llllllllll: sorry, my bot is running
 llllllllll: taking up all CG's resources
 wlesavo: works for me
 Astrobytes: Forum is fine for me
 Doju: this feels shameful but i'm submitting an intetionally buggy bot
 Illedan: There are never bugs, just unintended features
 eulerscheZahl: 2 browsers, no forum&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/12Tsc5z">https://imgur.com/a/12Tsc5z</a>
 kovi: happened to me few time this week
 Doju: Yes Illedan, same thing for rockets that have rapid unscheduled disassemblies
 Illedan: Forum works for me
 Illedan: Nothing new though
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to link something old
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and i tried a 3rd browser without success
 eulerscheZahl: not even epiphany loads it
 Illedan: How many browsers do you have&#160;:/
 dbdr: CSP violation
 eulerscheZahl: same
 journeyvivek: hello
 dbdr: might be a network issue that corrupts sth? def weird though
 journeyvivek: not on discord
 dbdr: Refused to load the script '&lt;URL&gt;' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'report-sample' &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;URL&gt;". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.
 eulerscheZahl: i disabled the policy in firefox for now
 Counterbalance: eulerscheZahl try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com">https://forum.codingame.com</a>
 Counterbalance: i got the same as you when not using https
 eulerscheZahl: that works Counterbalance :o
 jrke: you all wish to be in gold i am wishing to be in silver
 Doju: Ahh what the hell am i doing lmao
 Doju: i flood fill to the nearest pellet
 dbdr: nice Counterbalance
 Doju: and instead of doing some calculations on the actual distance
 dbdr: CG should redirect http to https
 Doju: i do them on the precalculated distance&#160;:|
 goore: none is online&#160;:/
 alexandreb09: Yop, anyone can help me with Winamax puzzle&#160;?
 logdog775: no
 alexandreb09: I can't figure out how to solve tests 9 and 19
 Doju: alexandreb09 i haven't done them but what are they about?
 alexandreb09: It reproduce a golf game with balls and hole. Balls can cross each other. Balls have several shoot possible (1 to n). First shoot is n jump, next n-1 and so on..
 alexandreb09: My problem is too long because when there are no more obvious move, I look at all combinations and start iterating. But when the number of balls comes high, it's a very bad approach
 alexandreb09: My problem is *that my code is* to long because
 alexandreb09: Maybe you can see it in Sponsord puzzle
 Doju: found it
 MattSOrme: how can i set a maze seed?
 wlesavo: you sure your brute force have no infinite loops? i remember that for me some simple recursion was quite enough
 Doju: MattSOrme you need to enable the expert mode in the editor
 AntiSquid: no gold yet ugh&#160;?
 Doju: from the settings
 Flashy911: is there a parameter to see if a pacman is dead in silver div?
 solaimanope: AntiSquid how to know which player is the silver boss?
 Tiramon: guessing from prev contests gold should arrive in the next hour
 alexandreb09: Yes, initially, I search all possible path with a recusive function. Then, I reduce all the paths till there are obvious movement (ball with only possible move to reach a hole). But for test 9 and 19, I face a moment there are a lot of balls with several movement allowed. Then, I compute a product among all possibility and iterate 
 Doju: uhh yeah i have no idea how to solve that hah
 Doju: sorry cant help
 alexandreb09: No worries, thx&#160;:)
 Flashy911: is there a parameter to see if a pacman is dead in silver div?
 Tiramon: yes
 Tiramon: typeId changes to DEAD
 Tiramon: problem is DEAD are listed, in bronze they were skiped
 Flashy911: Thanks  &lt;3
 drykberg: cant figure out what to do if pacs get stuck... they all just lump together and nothing happens
 drykberg: there must be some variable i can track each turn to figure out that they are stuck and should change direction
 Doju: drykberg a simple (definitely not elegant) solution to that is to just give them random directions whenever they are stuck
 Tiramon: compare with x/y of prev turn
 duckquackduck: check if they are in the same position as last turn? 
 Doju: and they are stuck if their last pos is equal to the current pos
 drykberg: okay
 Hjax: im surprised gold isnt open yet 
 AntiSquid: yes it's strange
 Tiramon: they are late
 AntiSquid: maybe they're still deciding whether to do the cut off at 10 or not :P
 Tiramon: [CG]Thibaud any eta for the boss? he is missed ...
 AntiSquid: or they forgot ... happened once
 Tiramon: oh yes =)
 dbdr: when?
 AntiSquid: during botg
 AntiSquid: had to remind them
 dbdr: was it same day?
 AntiSquid: "oh its wednesday?"
 Doju: hah
 Tiramon: thats why i pinged thibaud ... maybe it helps&#160;;)
 kovi: goldelay?
 Doju: that's funny
 AntiSquid: well first got told that it opens on wednesday ... dbdr
 Tiramon: and the is no computing bot right now in silver that looks like he will be the boss
 dbdr: ok, but which wedesday?&#160;;)
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 Tiramon: or maybe because thibaud does not respond [CG]Maxime knows an eta of the boss
 dbdr: that's typical, announce the day, but not the week, etc.
 Illedan: lol
 [CG]Maxime:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: well no way the would have prolonged contest after insisting to have it for standard period dbdr
 Illedan: Gold /o/
 Icebox: pogu
 Icebox: I'm instantly in gold
 Icebox: very generous
 solaimanope: Gold :D
 AntiSquid: didnt update for me damn
 Illedan: What rank?
 Icebox: 200
 Tiramon: oh boss arrived ... evil silent [CG]Maxime&#160;;)
 Illedan: 200?
 Icebox: yes
 Illedan: Daym, so many
 RockyMullet: yay&#160;!
 Tiramon: yes and i was 199&#160;;)
 Earthborne: type_id DEAD is only given for my own pacs, right? 
 Tiramon: for all
 RockyMullet: now, is it where my bot will die.... likely
 Tiramon: and LOS does not matter
 RockyMullet: 111 so far
 Earthborne: So I can use it to delete opponent pacs that have died regardless of where they were?
 JohnCM: haha great news!
 AntiSquid: hi JohnCoder did you get any sleep?
 AntiSquid: JohnCM *
 JohnCM: about to
 Hjax: yeah gold seems pretty huge 
 JohnCM: was busy doing some work just now
 JohnCM: just in time for league change
 JohnCM:&#160;:) going off then cya
 Hjax: i havent submitted since my DEAD fix on monday, and my bot got gold from rank 180 or so 
 Earthborne: Oh, sry Tiramon, you answered the next question as well, thx&#160;:) 
 AntiSquid: imo gold isnt much harder than silver, little diff
 Tiramon: no changes in golf
 Tiramon: *gold
 AntiSquid: gonna get big soon
 Thiesjoo: Yay, my rank is increasing due to people going to gold. Already went up 100 ranks
 sunksuperset370:&#160;:(
 shashwat986: I barely made it into gold XD
 sunksuperset370: &gt;:(
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: wood 1
 sunksuperset370: me wood 1
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 sunksuperset370: i am just playing with yall
 shashwat986: I think my last submission just inched past the boss-line
 sunksuperset370: which level
 sunksuperset370: league
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 Doju: silver to gold
 jrke: how many in gold presently
 sunksuperset370: jiam
 Quidome: 212
 sunksuperset370: jiam
 Doju: that's a lot of people :o
 sunksuperset370: that's a lot
 AntiSquid: lol
 sunksuperset370: :o
 jrke: K means they again took 200
 AntiSquid: and legend be like 10-15 
 Doju: the boss doesn't rhyme with inky&#160;:(
 Doju: what a tragedy
 AntiSquid: boss name?
 Doju: Clyde
 RockyMullet: there is a a bit more people in this contest than usual
 Doju: blinky-pinky-inky....
 Doju: CLYDE would be a good name!
 Doju: :D
 Tiramon: 213
 Tiramon: oh chat was scrolled up
 AntiSquid: could have been stinky
 twray2: they are the names of the ghosts from arcade pacman
 RockyMullet: Diddly
 MattSOrme: they're the ghost names from pacman
 Doju: oh
 AntiSquid: dildy? RockyMullet
 Doju: okay well that makes sense
 Doju: then i have to blame the creator of pacman
 RockyMullet: it rhymes
 MattSOrme: There isn't a fifth ghost though, so what will they call gold boss?
 Doju: damn you TÅru Iwatani!
 jacek: unvaccinated kid
 AntiSquid: Cherry&#160;?
 jrke: whats new in gold
 wlesavo: Eat more pellets than your opponent! And avoid getting killed!
 wlesavo: thats new
 AntiSquid: there is one in pacman2, it eats the arena under certain conditions MattSOrme
 kovi: interesting, some new names again in top20
 Illedan: Ghosts have arrived in gold
 kovi: recalc shuffles
 Illedan: kovi, very few placement games
 kovi: some were not able to "break through" earlier
 Illedan: Just a bunch of luck
 kovi: but can compete in top
 Illedan: My bot yesterday ended both 2nd and 31st :P
 jrke: luck is main i had 24 rank 400 rank with same code in just 2hours
 zarif98sjs: Any tips on how to improve in silver&#160;?&#160;:) 
 zarif98sjs: i feel like i am always losing like for 10-15 points
 AntiSquid: fight harder
 kovi: illedan, true...still low number of games
 Hjax: i spent some time working on a monte carlo bot, but its considerably worse than my bad heuristic bot 
 Hjax: now im not sure what i want to do 
 zarif98sjs: whenever i try to improve (at least i think i fixed some bugs) it happens to perform poorly 
 Peudoki: will the number of games be higher in gold than silver? 
 RockyMullet: Hjax knowing more about enemy possible position helps to know where the pellets are likely already gone
 Peudoki: I'm always hoping because of the high variance
 kovi: lucly rolls for me
 Hjax: yeah i know about enemy tracking RockyMullet, but im trying to work on search first 
 AntiSquid: avatar came out of nowhere
 Hjax: but my attempt at search seems to have gone very poorly :D 
 RockyMullet: yeah im doing search now
 RockyMullet: but its not working yet
 RockyMullet: and I got promoted to gold, so its possible without
 Peudoki: I'm using bunch of random heuristics on top of eachother
 Peudoki: the real scientific methode
 Doju: what do heuristics even mean in this context?
 Doju: I read last night that they're basically like simplifications or something
 Doju: so would going for the closest pellet just be a heuristic?
 RockyMullet: ya
 RockyMullet: I mean, heuristic is just a word to say "I felt like it would be the best move" without really knowing if it is :P
 Peudoki: it's like instead of doing some precise calculations, your AI goes: "feels like it could be kinda good to go there, so let's do it"
 Hjax: my old heuristic bot got gold as well 
 RockyMullet: like Peudoki said hehe
 Hjax: my monte carlo bot makes me sad 
 RockyMullet: yeah... my search is still at the point of "hum no, this is not the best move"
 RockyMullet: need some debugging hehe
 Hjax: mine is at the point of doing completely inexplicable things 
 Hjax: like rarely not moving at all 
 AntiSquid: idk "heuristic" doesn't make much sense, i just need to give my approach a name and suddenly it's a specialized algorithm and not a heuristic anymore
 RockyMullet: yah heuristic means "I made up some shit" haha
 Doju: Okay thanks for explaining
 AntiSquid: named heuristics are shit someone else made up though
 RockyMullet: yes
 RockyMullet: official shit
 AntiSquid: world renowned shit
 RockyMullet: :ok_hand:
 Donotalo: can a pac take L shaped turn when speed is activated?
 Doju: i think so
 Doju: donotalo
 Peudoki: yes Donotalo
 Hjax: i think i dont completely understand how the top bots that are using search work 
 Donotalo: thanks guys
 AntiSquid: just search for an answer 
 RockyMullet: Hjax search is hard if you dont have enough information
 RockyMullet: so I'll propbably wont submit a good search until I improve my enemy prediction
 Hjax: my search is just trying to maximize pellets 
 Peudoki: well I still kind of ignore enemies even if I see them
 Hjax: but my search strategy is pretty silly 
 Peudoki: so I'm far from needing to predict them
 RockyMullet: yah, but the result is wrong if you get an enemy in your face
 Doju: lmao
 AntiSquid: 217
 AntiSquid: 300 by the end of the evening
 AntiSquid: 500 by the time legend opens
 jrke: its night in india
 AntiSquid: or more&#160;?
 Hjax: make random moves, keep track of how many pellets you pick up, use the move set that got you the most pellets 
 RockyMullet: and its noon here, evening is far :D
 Hjax: boring monte carlo thing lol 
 Peudoki: how random though?
 RockyMullet: mine is brute force so far
 Hjax: completely random? 
 Peudoki: with some heuristic or just full on?
 Peudoki: I see
 jrke: antisquid which country you are in
 WillNess: MadKnight
 Hjax: it wins sometimes against my heuristic bot, im probably going to replace it with a real search 
 RockyMullet: jrke you can see the flag of the country of others if you hover over their avatar
 Hjax: maybe working on enemy tracking is worth doing first
 Hjax: i just wanted to finish search and be done with it 
 RockyMullet: enemy tracking can also help your heuristic
 jrke: looks server is slowed down again
 shashwat986: um i think i broke something
 shashwat986: damnn
 Hjax: thats true RockyMullet, im just annoyed that my search doesnt work 
 Hjax: im not sure how MSmits got his working, but whatever he did its better than what i tried 
 NickStahl: Somebody here that precalculates distance for the whole map in the first turn? I tried to do it but seems to time out.
 RockyMullet: yeah I know the feeling, I almost gave up this morning cause I though it was too intense without timeouts
 RockyMullet: just had a bug in the end :P
 jke: this is my first contest, do you guys at the top generally open source your solutions after it ends?
 RockyMullet: NickStahl yes, a bfs
 RockyMullet: jke its common from people to share their solution on the forum once its over
 duckquackduck: @NickStahl, yes. You don't ened to map every cell =&gt; every cell. Just one cell =&gt; every cell, which should give you path for eveyrything
 NickStahl: duckquackduck yeah, that's what I did. But seems I suck at optimizing
 AntiSquid: hm ladder is a bit too shuffled, can't really test much
 RockyMullet: most bots are stabilized tho
 AntiSquid: wanted to compared old bot vs new bot
 Peudoki: kovi is still the king of pacs
 jrke: kovi took his place&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: kovi got pinged
 jrke:&#160;;)
 cegprakash: MadKnight I accidentally closed ur message box how do I open it back
 BenjaminUrquhart: k tiem to promote really quick
 Doju: duckquackduck yes you do need to map every cell &gt; every cell
 BenjaminUrquhart: time*
 jrke: looks like kovi has magnet for first rank&#160;;)
 BenjaminUrquhart: cegprakash click on his name in chat
 BenjaminUrquhart: like the message
 shashwat986: NickStahl what language?
 Peudoki: has anyone ever won a game against kovi?
 shashwat986: I have, once or twice, while debugging, but never on the ladder
 Doju: Can't you play against people in a higher league?
 Doju: ah thats dumb
 AntiSquid: it is
 NickStahl: shashwat986 c#
 BenjaminUrquhart: Peudoki once
 shashwat986: hmm, c# should be fast enough to do BFS properly
 BenjaminUrquhart: then he resubmitted
 shashwat986: my ruby code does it in barely enough time. like 950ms XD
 shashwat986: (which means I'm timing out in a small fraction of my games)
 NickStahl: shashwat986 Yeah, I should practice some more in the normal games. I probably have inefficient code.
 BenjaminUrquhart: I could probably do it in ~100ms java, depends on how well the JVM warms up
 BenjaminUrquhart: I do it on CoIF in ~60ms but fro a different purpose
 Peudoki: btw how many lines of code do you guys use?
 BenjaminUrquhart: doens't matter
 BenjaminUrquhart: different langs have different lengths
 MarekM: 344.
 MarekM: 344
 Peudoki: I use 550 C++
 Doju: BenjaminUrquhart yeah but you'll still get a vague idea of the complexity of the code
 Doju: Peudoki 600 in python
 BenjaminUrquhart: 788 java
 BenjaminUrquhart: but I write long code
 Thiesjoo: 380 in javascript rank 500 in silver
 Peudoki: good to hear, I was getting a bit worried that my code is unreasonably long
 RockyMullet: im at 3k now
 RockyMullet: and I still think its irrelevent
 RockyMullet: in C++
 Peudoki: 3k in C++, is that even possible?
 BenjaminUrquhart: clearly
 RockyMullet: 3175 to be precise
 njaber: 1700 C#
 Peudoki: okay mine is definitely not worryingly long
 BenjaminUrquhart: struct ascend please
 BenjaminUrquhart: wait he's not online
 RockyMullet: well it includes a lot fo debug output code, some of my custom classes that I reuse, etc etc
 Peudoki: I see
 Peudoki: I just work from scratch
 RockyMullet: some dead code of commented failed attempts
 RockyMullet: well a lot of games here are on a 2 grid, so I have a class of a 2d position and some functions that goes with it
 RockyMullet: like I started to code a search algo yesterday, only that is 500 lines
 RockyMullet: anyway
 RockyMullet: I dont think its relevent :P
 Peudoki: yeah this is my first contest
 Peudoki: maybe I should think about making my code reusable
 njaber: I'm trying so hard to heuristic this shit afficiently, I got some good ideas but I still lack the one thing that will push my algorithm from neat to actually useful, it's so frustrating
 njaber: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462888772">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462888772</a> I like how they move but they still don't have the good incentives/directions, and if I do direct pellet targeting it defeats the whole purpose of what I'm doing (don't wanna spoil tho)
 RockyMullet: Peudoki personnally, I digged in old contest and just by digging again and again, it just became more complet
 BenjaminUrquhart: I've ascended
 RockyMullet: njaber but why arent you moving :thinking:
 Xlos: The question for everyone in bronze league
 jrke: what question
 njaber: Without spoiling too much I don't have the good incentives, the algo I do judges that it's more optimal to stay in place during times where it isn't, and I just need to find what to modify to remove this incentive
 njaber: And I don't want to hard code it either
 njaber: there's no point
 RockyMullet: it is so rarely the right answer to not move
 kovi: it might be safer to stay. just not more effective on average
 njaber: Yeah but like I said I can't hardcode it because it just wouldn't do anything useful with my algo
 njaber: and if I just change to targeting pellets it just defeats the purpose of this algo
 njaber: I've been thinking of ways to fix it tho, I'm just so close yet so far to find it
 Janexor: just got to the silver but im not sure why seeing dead pacs may make it harder/easuer. Am I missing smth?
 RockyMullet: Janexor likely a hot fix
 RockyMullet: that they realize during the contest "oh, we should probably tell them when a pac is dead"
 RockyMullet: and to not greak submited bots, they only introduce it in newer league
 RockyMullet: break*
 Janexor: thought that if the pac is dead it is just no in'visible_pac_count'
 BenjaminUrquhart: it also won't be there if it's not in your line of sight
 Janexor: thats why i thought so - u cant see dead people :p
 aCat: you can
 aCat: in silver
 aCat: it has special type DEAD then
 Janexor: I know, but i wonder how it could be usefull
 njaber: In knowing where enmies are/aren't/what path they could have taken
 njaber: I personally really like this addition
 njaber: Before there was no way to be sure an enemy pac was dead except from deduction, you couldn't even know WHERE your own pac died, there was no way to know if it was on the first or second cell it traversed
 vbplaya: For some reason the chat wasn't working earlier in the week.  But I have a question.  Have others had issues where the  visible pellet count was wrong on bigger maps?
 THEASIAN: Does anyone have any tips? I'm trying to learn C#
 njaber: I can help if you have specific questions, but I don't really have any tips in mind
 RockyMullet: vbplaya in wood they would tell you where all pellets are, but once in bronze you only know the pellet in your line of sight
 RockyMullet: THEASIAN go watch a crash course of like 30 min on youtube to know the syntax, then try your hand on easy puzzles here, google when you dont know how to do something
 RockyMullet: you should learn over time
 RoboStac: vbplaya - are you using python and printing them out to stderr with the last one missing?
 RoboStac: (if so check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/180397/67">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/180397/67</a> )
 THEASIAN: @RockyMullet thank you
 RockyMullet: np
 Quidome: who is the silver boss?
 Quidome: do we know?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i thought it was a year ago
 drykberg: i think im done with this. i keep suddenly keep getting the error "coordinate is outside of grid" ...
 AntiSquid: did everyone suddenly improve? old bot only getting up to 200&#160;:/
 Seti: are we allowed to use WAIT command? I don't see this one in rules, however it is in source code
 drykberg: all i do is store the coordinates of pellets in an array
 RockyMullet: drykberg you can watch in the log what you outputed
 drykberg: i did
 drykberg: and its crazy, it loops through visible pellets sometimes 0 - 10, 0 - 10 etc. and overwrites stuff
 drykberg: then other times the loop goes from 0 - 100 
 drykberg: it passes in the same coordinates for different pellets
 drykberg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/775e7236-6ee0-4fa5-b656-d62b6a646be6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/775e7236-6ee0-4fa5-b656-d62b6a646be6</a>
 AlluringChair: @vbplaya it happened to me once, and my game crashed because of this. Although it happened only once in hundreds of games, it could be my error but i don't see how
 drykberg:             if (i=10) {
 drykberg: if (i=10) {fprintf(stderr,"%d x input %d\n",i,x);fprintf(stderr,"%d y input %d\n",i,y);}
 RoboStac: that almost certainly needs to be ==
 drykberg: true that
 jrke: hey yes it should be ==
 BenWo: afternoon folks
 BenWo: got excited about my rank until I saw that gold has opened, lol
 AlluringChair: is there a way to check my current response time? i'm trying to measure it with time function but i get 52-60ms and since that would result in a timeout it's obviously not correct...
 BenWo: from what I've been told, start your timer right after your first input read in the loop
 drykberg: MOVE 0 14 91 |MOVE 1 18 92 |
 drykberg: i just dont understand where these values come from....&#160;:(
 AlluringChair: that's what i'm doing but i'm getting too high values
 Counterbalance: maybe you forgot a space after the command and before the message, drykberg
 AlluringChair: whatever maybe python time.time() is bugged
 BenWo: I used time.process_time()
 BenWo: usually get a sub 1ms number
 MarekM: alluring, i am using time.time() and looks ok, isnt timeout 100ms?
 AlluringChair: oh sorry you were right i had it before first input
 AlluringChair: not it's 1-2ms
 AlluringChair: now*
 DaFish: we have all made that mistake...
 tobk: whops, got pushed up&#160;:-)
 MarekM: ouch, 50ms, ok then&#160;:)
 tobk: somehow my motivation for that big refactoring I had in mind suddenly dropped...
 BenWo: heh
 AlluringChair: looks like i've got plenty of time for realtime a*
 BenWo: yeah as long as you're not inefficient
 Doju: i don't really get why you'd want to do a*
 BenWo: heya Doju
 Doju: Heya BenWO
 Doju: BenWo* :D
 BenWo:&#160;:)
 BenWo: how goes?
 Doju: uuumm pretty decent
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok I guess
 Doju: i'm applying some fixes atm
 BenWo: :thumbsup: fixes are good
 Tiramon: great i'm motivated to learn at udacity and now their auth isn't working ...
 Doju: BenWo Not always
 Ramzel: Game Summary:Inky has not provided 1 lines in time
 Ramzel: Bot crashed?
 Doju: fixed a relatively major bug and dropper in ranks by 200
 BenWo: lol that's the best
 Tiramon: that's normal everbody has that moment when a major bug is fixed and bot performs worse&#160;;)
 BenWo: Ramzel - scroll up in the log, see if it shows a crash the turn above
 BenWo: I've had that so many times because I forgot a "if X is not None:"
 Ramzel: I m checking if my pacs change class right now propertly, so i started another play. The bot crushed in first move and i won taking all pellets
 Doju: starting to do some work on paths instead of distances
 Doju: i bet i'm gonna have so many off-by-ones
 jrke: hey anybody know how push a queue in c++
 Earthborne: push()
 Ramzel: q.push(int x);
 Ramzel: it dont need to be int
 Ramzel: q.front() - return front elemnt and q.pop() - erase front element
 jrke: but it just pushes one int
 Quidome: all pellets eaten and a draw :D
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462963979">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462963979</a>
 SamuelTheBad: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
 jrke: if i have to do append.list(9,8) in python  so what should i write it in c++
 Doju: i think you mean list.append
 jrke: ya 
 Earthborne: If you it's static in size I guess a simple array would do?
 SamuelTheBad: I'm glad someone mentioned that after first input thing, I thought I was nearly out of time, but that's far from true...
 Doju: umm
 Doju: how do you do anything before the first input?
 AlluringChair: he means measuring frame time
 SamuelTheBad: Yeah, I was starting my clock before the input came in
 Doju: oh
 Doju: i see
 drykberg: i put 2 debugging fprints in the game loop to see whats happening
 drykberg: 1st - immediately at start of game while loop, it prints "while loop starts"
 Doju: i'm working on both Cell instance and pos tuples
 Earthborne: jrke vector is a good option in c++
 Doju: should i write basically every function to accept either one as input or is that bad practice?
 drykberg: 2nd - when the number of pacs is passed in, it prints "mine pac count ="
 drykberg: while loop starts
 drykberg: mine pac count = 5
 drykberg: while loop starts
 drykberg: mine pac count = 1
 drykberg: what the fuck is this shit 
 BenWo: dang Doju, sounds like you have the same architecture going on that I do, lol
 BenWo: half of my functions take a touple, have take a node object, lol
 BenWo: *tuple
 Doju: same&#160;:/
 Doju: it kinda sucks
 Counterbalance: you could have cell extend from pos..
 Doju: pos is just a tuple?
 Doju: can you extend a tuple?
 BenWo: I don't think so?
 Doju: i mean...
 Earthborne: You can encapsulate that tuple in a class 
 Doju: isnt everything a class in python though
 BenWo: yeah just was thinking
 BenWo: technically I guess it's possible
 Earthborne: oh, that's true
 BenWo: feels weird though
 Earthborne: So can you extend tuple?
 Doju: uhh
 Quidome: in python you can;t extend a tuple
 Doju: i made my Cell class inherit from tuple
 Doju: got an error saying "tuple expected at most 1 arguments, got 3"
 Quidome: o sorry
 Doju: when i tried to do Cell(x, y, value)
 Quidome: misunderstood
 Bastett: Nice. Silver promotion. Wonder how I'll perform with the same bot
 drykberg: this is totally broken isnt it?
 BenWo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41390372/why-cant-i-subclass-tuple-in-python3">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41390372/why-cant-i-subclass-tuple-in-python3</a>
 BenWo: Doju ^
 Tiramon: oh great just found a reason for a strange left/right dancing of my pac - that way looks good- oh a blocking pac other way - now that i don't see that pac anymore the old way looks good again ... oh a blocking pac
 Tiramon: drykberg what should be broken?
 Doju: Oh nice BenWo, that's exactly the thing
 Doju: I think this is getting even more messy
 Doju: but whatever
 Doju: embrace the mess
 BenWo: yeah I had just been reading that when you said
 BenWo: lol
 Bastett: hm, documentation is a little thin on the ground. What is the meaning of the new Dead status? Is a cell with a dead pac traversable?
 Doju: i'm learning so many things
 Tiramon: yes it is just information
 Tiramon: no effect on the game
 Bastett: nice
 Bastett: thanks
 Tiramon: else you could walk around the corner and killed one without knowing it
 Tiramon: now you know
 Maliamnon: It's just there to break you assumptions when you ascend to silver and make you fix code&#160;;)
 BenWo: yeah this challenge has certainly pushed me to learn a bunch too&#160;:)
 DIAGA: hey everyone&#160;! i need assistance with Coders strike back i have no idea how to work with the angles and distance where can i learn more about game programming with c++
 BenWo: diaga - angles you want to look into trigonometry 
 SamuelTheBad: vector maths might also be helpful
 AntiSquid: suddenly getting captchas wtf?
 SamuelTheBad: though they're p much the same thing
 Hjax: AntiSquid is a bot confirmed 
 AntiSquid: Hjax identified as a crosswalk
 DIAGA: thanks BenWo &amp; SamuelThebad! apreciate it alot
 BenWo: welcome&#160;:)
 Bastett: totally Maliamnon
 BenjaminUrquhart: Automaton2000 is human confirmed
 Automaton2000: you don't have to check the referee
 Doju: BenWo i still haven't figured out how to make the tuple thing work lol
 ashikujjaman: how to multi comment in codingame?
 seronis: concat them with a pipe seperator
 seronis: nvm..  i read  'multi command'
 jjdb210: Anyone know if there is a bug involving speed where if you have 1 do it, the rest get it as well?
 jjdb210: See this match for an example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462999109">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462999109</a>Blue ID 2 should not beat Red ID 0 to the power pellet... 
 Quidome: so now I have my collision detect in order what to do, hunting or gathering&#160;?
 Quidome: maybe first sleep...
 eulerscheZahl: hunting is fun
 Quidome: yeah I think so too
 Quidome: and it pays of to make the kill i suppose
 AntiSquid: shit now i broke my bot and have to rewrite Automaton2000 is there an easy way&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i guess there is some kind of monte carlo
 Quidome: need opponent tracking, ok first sleep
 eulerscheZahl: especially in the early game it does
 AntiSquid: hah&#160;! 
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 making sense
 Automaton2000: so i only have to check if they are not
 Quidome: no gold today&#160;:(
 Ramzel: Can i see every super pelet at game begin?
 Quidome: yes
 NickStahl: Ramzel yes
 Quidome: always 4 of them
 Ramzel: Ok
 Quidome: at every turn byw
 Quidome: BTW
 jjdb210: Can anyone explain how blue beats red to the pellet at 21,7 in this game? Is speed broken on turn 1? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462999109">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462999109</a>
 NickStahl: jjdb210 looks like you only move one cell each time although you have speed enabled?
 Hjax: yeah you are wasting your speed moves, so you arent moving faster
 Quidome: you have set your target at least at distance 2
 NickStahl: jjdb210 make sure to move to a pellet that is two steps away each move
 Quidome: or in this case more easy target the super pellet
 muy31: ^
 Quidome: speed will follow
 jjdb210: ah that could be it
 jjdb210: thank you
 muy31: you don't have any control over the speed turn
 muy31: so you just have to do what everyone else is saying
 Quidome: you do, but you don't move
 muy31: well, you cant for example move somewhere and move back during speed
 Quidome: Uh, yes true
 Quidome: that's somewhat annoying
 muy31: really
 muy31: ik
 DollarAkshay: Auto promoted to gold league&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: LOL
 eulerscheZahl: next stop legend?
 Ramzel: Are there always 4 superPellets?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Quidome: yes
 Icebox: how is that normal that steady_time returns 57 ms and I'm not timing out
 muy31: Someone look at this stomp:
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462984265">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462984265</a>
 eulerscheZahl: do you measure after reading input Icebox?
 muy31: Icebox, it's not accurate/ give or take
 drykberg: is there a way to start over?
 eulerscheZahl: but sometimes you can exceed the max time without getting killed
 Csipcsirip: you have some extra milisecs but seems to be random
 Icebox: eulerscheZahl is this my first competition? xD
 Icebox: yes ofc I measure after input
 drykberg: i dont know why, but for some reason my pacs always get sent of grid...
 eulerscheZahl: sorry&#160;:(
 Icebox: I might be stoopid
 Icebox: but not _THAT_ stoopid
 eulerscheZahl: but not that stupid
 Hjax: ive definitely taken 55 ms after reading inputs and not gotten killed
 Icebox: rip no markup
 Tiramon: drykberg there is a reset to default code button in the top right (the arrow)
 drykberg: thanks
 Icebox: I'm consistently getting 55-57
 Icebox: so I'm wondering is the measurement inaccurate
 wlesavo: the restriction is not so strict i guess, its quite approximate
 Icebox: or is the game not very strict
 eulerscheZahl: as strict as other games
 eulerscheZahl: same framework
 muy31: yeah, its not too strict
 Icebox: well I don't program in C++ so I doubted my measuring for a second there
 Icebox: but steady_time is pretty steady afaik
 Icebox: :upside_down:
 perseverent: how did you solved the problem with the pellet 10 value
 eulerscheZahl: give it 30 oints
 eulerscheZahl: points
 perseverent:&#160;:)
 perseverent: does not help me
 MSmits: :pig: oints oints
 perseverent: some idea to solve allocation problem
 eulerscheZahl: i wasn't collecting them sometimes, so i helped a bit
 MSmits: my code is a mess already&#160;:(
 perseverent: sometimes it's tricky
 MSmits: 1800 lines
 eulerscheZahl: wow
 Quidome: still have time
 Quidome: Rebuild!
 eulerscheZahl: but it's a successful mess
 perseverent: if close pac is send you loose other one that was also yours
 muy31: do you need enemy tracking to get out of silver?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 MSmits: yeah eulerscheZahl i am really surprised. This is the same code basically, that I had monday morning
 perseverent: nop
 MattSOrme: mine is 1000 lines of spahetti mess. I keep trying to tidy it up, but i really wanna use multiple files
 MSmits: I would have expected it to drop
 Nerchio: Automaton2000 are you good at micro with marines
 eulerscheZahl: but you will need tracking to reach legend i think
 Automaton2000: u need to get all the info you need
 Nerchio: lol
 Nerchio: automaton2000 with the wisdom 
 Automaton2000: but i didn't get that far
 eulerscheZahl: MattSOrme then use multiple files. and run a script to merge them before you submit
 drykberg: can I write code everywhere?
 eulerscheZahl: you are a coder, you can build such a system!
 perseverent: there must be some algo to solve for the optimum alocation of pac tu big pallet
 drykberg: or just inside the game loop?
 drykberg: should i put the array of pellet coordinates inside the gameloop? or outside?
 perseverent: some resource allocation algo
 Quidome: I was looking into that
 perseverent: but no luck finding it
 Quidome: but decided to start with collision
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)</a>
 muy31: im slowly auto climbing to gold? hope i get there
 Quidome: ah thnxs
 eulerscheZahl: but here one pacman can collect multiple pellets, so not a 100% fit
 drykberg: int p_v[10] = {NULL};int p_x[10] = {NULL};int p_y[10] = {NULL}; put this inside the game loop or outside?
 eulerscheZahl: anyways: 5 pacmen, 4 pellets. easy to bruteforce
 drykberg: to store the coordinates?
 drykberg: and value?
 Quidome: yes bruteforce, but what about the enemy
 perseverent: thaks eulerscheZahl
 muy31: so many people have decent code that it must be hard for codingame to actually compare AIs accurately
 Quidome: 10 pacs 4 pellets?
 eulerscheZahl: if you add opponents, yes
 Quidome: I am now at 45, is it possible to vlimb over night?
 eulerscheZahl: but 4Â¹â° &gt; 4âµ :scream:
 Doju: BenWo I think I got the tuple thing working
 muy31: for example, this  is the dude on his way to gold... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463027062">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463027062</a>
 eulerscheZahl: might be. go to sleep and find out
 eulerscheZahl: i'll do the same
 Doju: had to use some weird things i didn't know about but hey it works
 Quidome: :grin:
 Quidome: Anyhow Tommorow I go for the kill&#160;:)
 Quidome: bye
 BenWo: nice
 Tiramon: damn i hate it when the engine cuts the log output in late game
 BenWo: what weird things did you use? 
 Doju: also i have more magic methods and weird things than i've ever used
 Doju: but that's fine
 Doju: __new__ and super()
 Doju: yeah it works!
 BenWo: awesome
 Tiramon: ok guess i can submit again ... at least no strange behaviour in my solo games right now
 Doju: I can't this anywhere
 Doju: so i have a cell class which inherits a tuple
 Doju: python btw
 muy31: i feel like i just get unlucky when it comes to finding new pellets
 Doju: i have a method in the cell class that calls for pos as a tuple. Can i do something like super().self since it's already a tuple?
 WINWINWIN: Finally in Silver YES!!
 Ramzel: Finaly found stiupid bug
 Tiramon: ok found another strange behaviour, ignoring a superpellet in the neighbour cell is wrong
 jdsfklsd: Does practicing on this website actually help you improve or is it a sugar pill?
 Tiramon: i learned many new algorythms by using this side ... and the names for some i used before&#160;;)
 Doju: jdsfklsd i don't know about the actual practices but the spring challenge that we're all working on has definitely taught me a lot
 Doju: just learned about __new__ and super() in python
 jdsfklsd: What's the spring challenge?
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 Tiramon: current contest
 Tiramon: lasting 10days
 Tiramon: great if i run the same code localy it gathers the super pellet, in game it does not ...
 Xlos: I'm starting to lose big time due to running out of time&#160;:(
 Tiramon: then improve your code for more performance
 Xlos: waaa
 Kukiss: 1st time joined gold during contest&#160;:)
 Xlos: Actually, did any of you guys have something like floyd warshall at the start for distances between points
 Xlos: I optimized it with some rectangle method thing but it still TLEs about 1/10th of the time
 Doju: Xlos I do breadth-first search
 Doju: like many others
 Xlos: On every iteration?
 Doju: from every cell to every other cell during the first move
 Doju: and from pacs to pellets during the other moves
 Xlos: Oh you do bfs once per point
 Tiramon: yes that is not changing information as long as there is no blocks on the way
 BenWo: using BFS currently as well, I do it every few iterations
 BenWo: often for all 5 pacs in a single iteration, still only taking ~2ms apparently
 Xlos: Hmm I like my starting routine but I will use bfs while looking for pellets rn I'm going through everything, that should help a lot
 daffie: how do we know when a pac is dead&#160;?
 Xlos: it won't be given in the input
 Doju: it will in silver
 drykberg: is "int pellet_x[200] = {NULL};" the correct way to declare and initialize and array for storing x coordinates from a for loop?
 drykberg: does anyone whos good with C/C++ know&#160;? ^^
 daffie: I can't seem to figure out a way to officially know 100% when a pac is dead
 BenWo: not much good with C++, but that doesn't look right
 BenWo: daffie - your own pac?
 daffie: yes sir
 Doju: you can
 Alshock: daffie once you're in silver the inputs will tell you
 Doju: if it's not visible it's dead haha
 Xlos: bruh that's trash
 Alshock: oh your own pac? then just see if it's in the visible input
 BenWo: well, yeah it changes from silver on up
 Xlos: why does it give more info for silver
 Alshock: @Xlos because it's a patch
 Doju: anyone good with python here?
 BenWo: because they realized it was an issue, but didn't want to break the whole challenge
 Alshock: hum, somewaht okay, why?
 Edrevan: drykberg <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dummies.com/programming/cpp/initializing-an-array-in-c/">https://www.dummies.com/programming/cpp/initializing-an-array-in-c/</a>
 Counterbalance: drykberg the official way is  int * pellet_x = new int[200]; the fast way is int pellet_x[200]; memset(pellet_x, 0, sizeof(pellet_x)); // requires #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 daffie: how am I supposed to get to silver then
 Doju: Alshock my cell class inherits from tuple. How can i access the tuple?
 daffie: mine just keeps erroring out and crash from trying to give directions to a dead pac
 BenWo: before silver, you just stop getting updates for a pac that is dead
 Doju: like pos = cell.super().self?
 drykberg: okay thank you will look into it thanks
 Doju: but that doesn't work
 Edrevan: daffie you know a pac is dead when you don't see it in your visible pac input
 Alshock: @daffie target the closest big pellets or pellet if there's no big left and don't get eaten too easily
 MattSOrme: Does anyone know if 10's are always in the visible list, or only on first turn?
 Alshock: Doju just like you would with a tuple
 BenWo: super pellets are always visible
 Edrevan: every turn, check the pacs you are given as an input. If you didnt get one, then its dead
 Doju: Alshock no but when i do reference_to_cell = cell it doesn't give me the tuple but rather the clel
 daffie: yea that is what i am doing now, and still getting trashed by the boss lol
 Counterbalance: drykberg int pellet_x[200] = {0} is closer but only sets pellet_x[0] to 0; you'd have to add 199 more; A simpler way for you is maybe do a for loop and set each one to 0.
 Doju: and that's exactly what i what most times
 Doju: but sometimes i want to access the underlying tuple
 MattSOrme: That explains one of my bugs from like 2 days ago haha. thx
 Doju: without going pos = (cell[0], cell[1])
 Alshock: Doju what is it you can do with that pos that you can't with cell?
 daffie: I thought maybe I it would be great to simply assign each boss pac to one of mine, and switch once they're in view and kill them until I realized there is fog of war
 Alshock: keep it as simple as you can
 Doju:&#160;:/
 BenWo: doju - tup = cell.super() doesn't work?
 Doju: BenWo nope
 BenWo:&#160;:-/
 BenWo: tup = *cell ?
 BenWo: guessing at this point
 Alshock: my question was sincere though, what use do you have of pos that requires it to be another tuple?
 josegomez: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jcg.pictures/gdhcXjg0hdjwl.png">https://jcg.pictures/gdhcXjg0hdjwl.png</a>
 Doju: Oh, originally i didn't even inherit from tuple
 josegomez: decided to vizualize the game graph I generated
 BenWo: Alshock - I assume sending the coordinates as a command
 josegomez: and it looks freaking awesome
 josegomez: #Unrelated
 Doju: but i like half of my functions take tuples as input and half of them take cells
 Doju: and it's rather confusing
 NinjaDoggy: :O nice!
 Doju: but like*
 NinjaDoggy: i does look freaking awesome
 Alshock: I think they should all take cells, because there's no restriction that way, and you should be able to send your whole cell to all of them regardless
 Doju: hm
 Alshock: your cell IS a tuple
 Doju: it's not
 Alshock: oh I thought that now you inherit
 Doju: it's a bunch of values
 drykberg: @Counterbalance Does {NULL} or {0} not set all values to 0&#160;?
 drykberg: all values of the array?
 Alshock: Ok, my very bad then, what's your base class?
 Doju: erm
 Alshock: object?
 Doju: oh right i guess my cell is a tuple
 Doju: agh i don't not the terminology
 Doju: i have this:
 Doju: class Cell(tuple):
 Alshock: Yeah it's a tuple then ^^
 Alshock: but you may have twisted it afterwards
 Doju: oh shoot
 Doju: you're right
 Doju: hahah
 Doju: wait whaat now i'm even more confused
 Alshock: on which part? ^^'
 Doju: i can do something like
 Doju: pos = cell
 Doju: and it gives me the tuple
 Doju: but i can also do cell.foo
 Doju: or bar or whatever that's supposed to do
 Alshock: of course you can, because cell IS a tuple with additions
 Alshock: but you can't do pos.cell
 Doju: huh, okay
 Doju: that's rather handy
 Doju: thanks for explaining Alshock
 Doju: maybe i should stil change all of my functions to take cells though
 Doju: since some of them return tuples and like you said i can't do pos.cell
 Alshock: oh by the way I just said something wrong thinking of explicitely typed languages
 Alshock: pos.foo will work if you just do pos = cell ofc, it's if you call super to get the base tuple that it won't work
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: but i can't do (5, 3).foo
 Doju: and that's a problem that inheriting from a tuple won't solve
 Alshock: yep
 SilentSnowflake_d9fc: hey&#160;:)
 Alshock: hey
 Doju: so maybe i'll just change all my outputs to cells and call it a day :D
 SilentSnowflake_d9fc: you know react&#160;?
 Insomniak29: Any general tips for handling a pac being stuck? (ie. running into another pac). I'm currently backing them up a few steps and trying again, but that's causing some false positives when they backtrack to their next target normally.
 Doju: Insomniak29 I try to path so that they don't crash
 Doju: but in some cases they still do and when that happens i just tell them to go to random directions
 Insomniak29: I started with random and thought I was improving by back tracking... but you are right, I need to do custom pathing (haven't bit the bullet and tried that yet).
 Doju: It's a bit of a pain if you've never done it before
 Doju: i've been fixing bugs in my bfs up until today
 Insomniak29: &lt;---- never done it before ð¬
 Doju: now i think it's bug-free
 Doju: i recommend bfs (breadth-first search)
 Doju: it's pretty suitable for a grid with no weights
 Doju: and returns the shortest path every time
 Doju: look up the wiki page
 Insomniak29: thanks, I appreciate the help
 Doju: there's even some pseudocode that you can study
 WINWINWIN: Insomniak29, I didnt bother with a BFS
 WINWINWIN: I just checked if a collision ocurred and if it did, I just avoid the previous target
 Insomniak29: I can't seem to break 400 in Bronze and I think I've optimized other areas quite a bit. My next goals are 1) pathing, 2) making my Pacs social distance 3) Improve speed logic
 Doju: i think numer 2 is very important
 Doju: maybe even more than pathing
 Doju: although it's hard to do 2 without 1
 Doju: i was sitting at 400 in bronze. Implemented pacs as walls into my pathing and jumped 800 ranks
 Insomniak29: yeah, I think pathing will help a lot of my issues. I was also thinking about splitting the map into halves or quadrants and prioritizing pellet assignment based on the quadrant a Pac is in
 Insomniak29: Doju nice!
 Doju: sure, that's a valid strategy
 Valiant_Wolf: pacs as walls is working for me, along with also treating the moves for pacs already planned this turn as walls
 Valiant_Wolf: helps for when friendly pacs get stuck when entering a junction
 Insomniak29: @Valiant_Wolf nice tip
 Insomniak29: (how do you @ someone?)
 Doju: you don't need @
 Doju: Insomniak29
 thethiny: you just type their name
 Doju: oh this is so amazing though
 Doju: the tuple inheritance thing
 Doju: bye bye lines "pos = cell.x, cell.y"
 Doju: oh shoot... i think i need to make my pacs inherit from cells now hahah
 Kukiss: When you have paths it is also easier to use speed as you only have to take second step from path
 Doju: Kukiss that won't help if the pellets are next to you though
 Doju: if you're pathing to closest pellet
 Insomniak29: Kukiss what do you mean by second step from path?
 Kukiss: I am looking for best path with ~20 steps
 Doju: if you're doing something slightly less dumb then yess it's a godsend
 Kukiss: and taking the first moves
 Doju: Insomniak29 instead of getting distances using pathfinding you can get the paths themselves
 drykberg: in C/C++: The game passes x and y coordinates for the pellets. I put them in arrays. I log it.But when the visible_pellete loop closes and i open up the array to print the stored values, they are completely different...
 drykberg: i cant take it anymore... why
 Doju: drykberg aand this is why i'm using python
 Kukiss: do you clear the array before reading input?
 drykberg: no i dont touch it
 MarekM: game dont stop after 200 turns, last was 336 turns
 MarekM: didnt
 drykberg: i declare and initialize the arrays at the beginning of the game while loop
 Tiramon: yay and another bug fixed with dead ends
 Doju: MarekM if speed is used then it can go above 200
 Kukiss: drykberg, ok if you initialize it every turn than I have no idea what might cause the problem&#160;:/
 drykberg: then inside the "visible_pellet_count" loop i assign the passed in x and y values to the arrays
 Doju: seriosuly inheriting from a tuple was the best thing
 Doju: bye bye two nasty lines
 Counterbalance: glad that worked out
 drykberg: inside the loop i check if they were assigned correctly with fprintf 
 drykberg: then when the loop is finished, i do a new loop to go through the array and see whats in it

 thethiny: @Doju what is this tuple inheritance you're talking about
 Doju: thethiny my grid stores cells as objects. I made those cells inherit from a tuple and it made life so much easier
 thethiny: I don't get what's the benefit
 thethiny: does that mean you place the enemies/players/pellets in the cells directly?
 Doju: yeah i do that
 thethiny: oh nice
 Doju: and i think i'm gonna make the pacs inherit from cells soon
 Doju: but anyways the tuple thing is so helpful because... 
 Doju: well for example i just deleted like 10 lines from one of my functions
 Valiant_Wolf: it's tuples all the way down
 muy31: i cant believe all i had to do to start winning again was change some heuristic numbers
 thethiny: I'm stuck at 94 now
 thethiny: ð­
 Doju: Valiant_Wolf That's fine in my books
 Doju: oh waait no i can't make my pacs inherit from cells since they move&#160;:/
 thethiny: @Doju so instead ofgrid[y][x] == 1 or grid[y][x] == 10you just dogrid[y][x].type == 'Pellet'
 thethiny: if that's your case then don't make the Pac inherit from Cell
 thethiny: instead have the Cell has an object
 thethiny: so you can do sth like
 Doju: thethiny instead of "cell = some_path[0]pos = cell.x, cell.y" i just do "pos = some_path[0]"
 Doju: for example
 thethiny: type(grid[y][x]) == Pac
 thethiny: oh okay
 thethiny: good work then
 thethiny: you could've made a "Point" class 
 thethiny: and overload the assignment operator
 Doju: Hmmmmmm........
 Doju: i could :D
 Doju: inherit all the things!
 Doju: point class inherits from tuple
 Doju: cell inherits from point
 Doju: pac inherits from point
 thethiny: haha
 durkside: guys some player move pacs like this MOVE 0 10 7 2.143027 what does it mean&#160;?
 thethiny: let me show you a code snippet 
 thethiny: class Point: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19035dc8-4f52-406e-8412-1d1a8283b813">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19035dc8-4f52-406e-8412-1d1a8283b813</a>
 Alshock: wait wait, that's a detail here, but if you need to test a type isinstance(object, type) is much better
 thethiny: yes correct
 Alshock: because a Pac IS a Point, but type(Pac)&#160;!= Point
 Insomniak29: durkside they are just printing some value to the screen. probably a distance
 Doju: i don't really need to test for that anywhere
 thethiny: why does my pastebin say expired

 Doju: ok
 SparshMc07: hej do
 thethiny: @durkside MOVE &lt;pac_id&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;Message to display on screen&gt;

 muy31: it annoys me that Silver bot Clyde isn't good enough, so I lose to it
 thethiny: @Mods
 Alshock: that happens ever so often
 Stanworld: SPEED , does it means i can give 2 commands to each pods with SPEED activated&#160;? or it is only to move 2 tiles with one move command&#160;?
 icecream17: Let me try
 muy31: latter
 Alshock: @Stanworld 2 tiles with 1 command
 thethiny: @Stanworld only 1 
 Stanworld: thanks, mmm ok ok 
 icecream17: One day there were 01947498571305987345948759743509874359087509382450892543 bugs. Bug #143095714957459847518957 was solved in 489715984357 days, a new world record for the shortest time a bug from 100+ yrs ago was fixed. Wow. Wow. oqi342h53thdsa4'3tju

 Doju: ah i really want my pacs to inherit from cells&#160;:((
 thethiny: all expired
 thethiny: @Doju will create issues for you
 thethiny: Since Pac is NOT a cell
 thethiny: maybe make it HAVE a cell
 Doju: that might be better

 MonZtaDeluxe: rank 2 - come o
 MonZtaDeluxe: n
 Doju: nope i need to update it on every move
 Doju: not like that
 thethiny: yeah you can
 thethiny: let me show you how I'm handling update per move
 Doju: oh right, i could just throw it in my pac updating function and then all of my problems would be solved again :P
 thethiny: def end_turn(self):  for pac in self.player_pacs: if pac.action == 'MOVE':  pac.previous_position = pac.position   else: pac.previous_position = Point() #Reset Counter

 muy31: but silver bot just doesnt switch does he?
 Doju: those are some aggressive scissors
 muy31: why thank you
 muy31: i was hoping it would trap itself
 Doju: right thethiny i definitely need to give the pacs a cell
 Doju: atm i'm doing things like this in almost every function
 Doju: own_cell = self.grid.grid[self.y][self.x]
 Doju: sorry, method.
 Doju: i need to practice my coding vocabulary :D

 muy31: Doju, i call methods functions too
 Doju: hahah :D muy31
 Doju: close fight
 Doju: oh whaat
 Doju: i've seen a giraffe or something in your avatar
 Doju: now that it was larger
 Doju: it's clearly not that hahah
 Valiant_Wolf: at least you aren't calling them subroutines or something
 AntiSquid: so i added another bug and it increased my rank and i can't get any older version of my bot to work properly 
 Doju: AntiSquid i think it's best just to make one infinite loop and put as many bugs a possible into it
 Doju: that'll get you 1st place
 AntiSquid: i'll end up doing that if i don't rewrite
 muy31: im pretty sure that since everyone' code is half decent CG is having a hard time accurately ranking
 AntiSquid: i have perfect strategy actually doju, gonna exercise , shower and then sleep
 muy31: w/o destroying its servers
 AntiSquid: i am wrecking half of gold with 2 major bugs in my bot muy31, i don't think any accurate ranking would help
 Doju: AntiSquid that sounds like a solid plan. Taking a break is often times the best course of action
 muy31: well i cant promote to gold b/c im stuck behind 56 other goons...
 muy31: jk they are good too
 muy31: but everyone's bot is like the same
 muy31: you know what i mean
 icecream17: gold opened?
 AntiSquid: it's waiting for you icecream17, enter 
 muy31: hey doju btw you move dead pacs
 Doju: muy31 do i?
 Doju: uhh
 drykberg: is there a way to ask someone in the community to look at my code and tell me what i can improve?
 Doju: you're right i do move them
 Doju: not sure how that's happening 
 Doju: maybe silver broke my bot
 Doju: oh yup it sure did
 Doju: Thanks muy31. Fixed (in ide, at least)
 icecream17: i'm all the way back at bronze....
 BenjaminUrquhart: what do, work on contest or break minecraft
 Doju: why is there a comment in my code that just says
 Doju: # BUG
 BenWo: good reminder
 Doju: with absolutely no reference to what the issue might be
 icecream17: sleepproblemssleep? I remember someone saying... aw I forgot to take notes agaion
 Doju: and i've been looking for an off-by-one for the past few hours
 Doju: just as i predicted
 Doju: lovely
 icecream17: Yes! By moving away from opponents it's a slight increase from 77 pellets to 84
 icecream17: *my players, not opponent
 MSmits: it is somehow conforting to be able to explain almost every loss on a submit with something still on your todo list :P
 Tiramon: wow stupid bug ,,, instead of 80ms per turn it's done in 3ms
 MSmits: nice one
 Stanworld: so even with speed , i cannot go front and back in one move ...
 MSmits: you cant
 MSmits: because there is one end-cell and it will assume you're not moving at all
 icecream17: This is gonna slow me down so much. Person in like, 1300th place beat me by 2 points.
 Drastic_Loontastic: How do I move multiple pacmen at once?
 mrawson: pipe delimiter
 MSmits: read the description
 MSmits: MOVE 0 17 5 17 5|MOVE 1 20 3 20 3|MOVE 2 11 6 11 6|MOVE 3 29 10 29 10|MOVE 4 3 10 3 10
 Codewalker: is the challenge down?
 Drastic_Loontastic: Oh, thank you so much!
 MSmits: oh btw, the extra numbers in my command are messages, ignore that
 MSmits: just the first 3 numbers
 thethiny: idk if the challenge is down but I'm down for the challenge 
 MSmits: pro-pun
 MSmits: :thumbsup:
 icecream17: Heave excited breathing!
 icecream17: Won first 12 games of submit! 13!
 Doju: nice icecream17
 NapTown: and the 14th?
 Icebox: rip icecream17
 Doju: xD
 icecream17: no. not the 14th. i lost to someone in 1108th place. got totally wrecked. but still doing much better than last time
 Icebox: yeah you already wrote that you won the first 6227020800 games
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463140624">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463140624</a> lost by the 4th frame
 icecream17: noo i think i jinxed myself. just lost 7 games in a row
 Uljahn: is it ceg's clone? :unamused:
 icecream17:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Worse Uljahn
 Icebox: oof
 drykberg: could it be that the game does not let you sort before making first moves?
 drykberg: if i make the move conditional on sorting being finished i lose for producing no line
 drykberg: if i dont make it conditional, then it will execute the move, even though the sorting isnt ready yet
 Astrobytes: Either your sort is timing you out by taking too long or you are not returning any output from it I guess
 Uljahn: game doesn't let you exceed time limits
 drykberg: does the debugging cost time?
 Uljahn: yep but not very much
 Astrobytes: if you output a helluva lot then possibly, I'm guessing this isn't the issue
 Astrobytes: What are you sorting and what are your conditions?
 Doju: drykberg i tried to a timeout caused by my prints for 2 hours :D
 drykberg: haha
 Astrobytes: If this is another Python buffer flush issue I am just gonna... growl silently
 drykberg: well i have 4 arrays for x, y, value and bestindex
 drykberg: so i go through the value array and put the index of the big points in the bestindex array
 drykberg: when i do my moves i take the value from the bestindex array
 Astrobytes: Why not a 2d array of x,y with the value?
 Astrobytes: *as the entry
 drykberg: because im on C and i dont even know if thats possible
 Astrobytes: er...
 drykberg: i know its with object properties in java and python whatever but i have never done it there either
 drykberg: dont think you can in C
 drykberg: can you?
 icecream17: Nested Array?
 Astrobytes: int arr[x][y]&#160;?
 drykberg: ah well
 icecream17: board[0] = [' ', '#', ' ', ' ', '#', '#']?
 drykberg: okay well i have seen that before
 Counterbalance: struct Pellet { int x, y, value };
 Astrobytes: With sizes of course
 drykberg: 2d array
 drykberg: but does that help me?
 drykberg: maybe i should just look through the array from the end
 Astrobytes: also see Counterbalance's suggestion
 drykberg: thank you counterbalance
 Counterbalance: it makes things a lot easier.. your array would then be:
 Counterbalance: you can also do  struct Pos { int x, y; } and  struct Pellet { Pos pos; int value; }; that will come in handy
 Doju: argh, what is this about ._.

 Astrobytes: you lost Doju
 thethiny: @Doju I followed your advice
 thethiny: class Cell: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d24a76c7-62fd-46dd-954b-20c597e6871e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d24a76c7-62fd-46dd-954b-20c597e6871e</a>
 thethiny: def __int__(self):  return self.value
 thethiny: now all I need to do is int(cell)
 thethiny: and it'll give me the value
 Twelve0: ,
 NapTown: Doju your pacs are dancing
 Doju: nice thethiny
 Doju: not sure if it's any better than doing cell.value but sure, that's nice :D
 thethiny: I can do cell.value as well but int(cell) allows me to do:if int(cell) == -1:
 Doju: if cell.value == -1?
 thethiny: as I said it works too lol
 Doju: ok lol
 thethiny: the only advantage here is Cell == Cell
 thethiny: no need for .value
 Doju: hmm
 Doju: sure, that's fine i guess
 Doju: since you don't have duplicate cells
 thethiny: or I can Cell == -1, since I can override int comparison
 thethiny: Cell == -1 or -1 == int(Cell)
 Doju: so you can check for their identity with if cell is cell
 thethiny: anyways I'm not using it yet I just have it in the code
 thethiny: thanks for the tip though
 ashikujjaman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463165661">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463165661</a>this is the best match from me:heart_eyes:
 ashikujjaman: how you guys manage to pass throw the cave?how you guys managed to find shortest path through the cave?
 thethiny: you mean the warp?
 thethiny: or the blocked corners
 ashikujjaman: warp
 Doju: ashikujjaman i have that in my cell.get_neighbours() method
 Doju: or rather
 thethiny: Basically there are 2 ways to do it
 thethiny: 1, you calculate the distance from your place to the warp, then from the opposite warp to you
 thethiny: 2, you do BFS/DFS/A* and it auto does that
 Doju: as a "consequence" of having my cell.get_neighbours() method output the other side of the map if  it's at the edge my BFS gets the path for me
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/yRDTQvq">https://imgur.com/a/yRDTQvq</a>
 thethiny: you know Doju what's funny about your Pacs is that they have "Logic" on top of their head
 Doju: you know
 Doju: debugging :P
 Doju: if they have logic on their head then they use some logic in their movement
 Doju: otherwise not
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 muy31: 11th? maybe moving to gold?
 duckquackduck: hmm, not calculating path from every cell to every cell at the start is causing me issues. Doju, you were right. I think I have to do it, but mine never finishes under 1 sec 
 duckquackduck: i was only doing 1 cell to every other cell at start. 
 Doju: duckquackduck what algorithm are you using?
 duckquackduck: BFS
 Doju: okay, and do you use it so that
 Doju: you run it once for each cell
 Doju: or do you run each cell times for each cell
 Doju: in other words:
 muy31: cleaning the board: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463173792">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463173792</a>
 duckquackduck: each times for each cell. 
 Doju: don't do that.
 duckquackduck: each cell times each cell *
 muy31: that's fine duckquackduck
 Doju: it's not
 muy31: for precalc
 Doju: youre running it each cell too many times
 Doju: and it's timing out
 muy31: you make a different BFS for each cell in the beginning
 muy31: that's what 1000 ms is for
 Doju: yes do that
 Doju: noo
 Doju: muy31 you don't understand
 muy31:&#160;?
 Doju: he's not flooding the board once for each cell
 muy31: explain
 Doju: he's flooding the board each cell times for each cell
 Doju: he can get the exact same result by only flooding once
 muy31: oh yeesh
 muy31: i see
 Doju: duckquackduck so the problem is you're running a bfs to a target cell
 Doju: you shouldn't have a target
 muy31: duckquackduck make an array of the last cells you flooded and only flood the empty neighbor
 Doju: but rather just take note of the distance every time you hit a new cell
 muy31: flood the whole board
 Doju: no
 muy31: that can be done w/ a 2d integer array
 Doju: that's not what im talking about lol
 muy31: Lemme show you my BFS...
 duckquackduck: So I do a BFS from a starting cell to every other cell on the Map. Then I store the path from the that cell to starting cell. 
 Doju: don't copy paste code
 muy31: static int[][][][] distances;
 Doju: just tell me what it does
 muy31: just snippets
 muy31: no biggie
 muy31: it doesnt matter
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ef64b19-e207-4142-ac45-cfb51079708c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ef64b19-e207-4142-ac45-cfb51079708c</a>
 Doju: duckquackduck you do a flood fill from each cell of the map
 Doju: you don't give the "bfs" a target cell that stops it
 muy31: oh yea pastebin doesnt work
 Doju: you just let it run until the queue is empty
 duckquackduck: ah you guys are also floofilling
 Doju: and for every new child you map the distance
 muy31: by child he means neighboring cell
 duckquackduck: as in scoring the neighbours? and so on? 
 duckquackduck: ah, I think I get it
 Doju: neighboring cell that is not a wall
 duckquackduck: thanks a bunch
 muy31: yes, with distance
 muy31: the score is the distance from the start position
 Doju: you can also store the path if thats what you want
 duckquackduck: and then you just trace back when you want to find distance from a-&gt;b?
 Doju: but distance works too
 muy31: true
 Doju: sure, that works
 Doju: might be a tad slower than storing a "depth" variable and ++ing it for every layer in the graph
 Doju: but it's easier to change to output the path instead
 muy31: Here's how i did it
 muy31: start w/ empty integer array
 muy31: 2) make start poition 1
 muy31: make neighbors 2
 muy31: 3) for every new neighbor ++
 muy31: these neighbors should not be repeated
 muy31: so, they need to be empty or 0
 muy31: distance i going to be equal to the integer of the target cell - 1
 muy31: since we started with 1
 muy31: and just do that for every coordinate in the beginning
 muy31: so you precalc all distances in about 10 - 15 ms
 Uljahn: that's right, im doing it with scipy in python under 20ms
 Doju: Uljahn any optimizations?
 Uljahn: all distances + paths
 Uljahn: but you need to build a graph first
 AntiSquid: everything is possible in C
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll
 Clagus: damn... precalcing all distances in C# takes ~300ms for me :P 
 Clagus: but well... c#...
 Doju: about 100 ms for me with no optimizations in python
 Uljahn: nice
 PiterYeh: Clagus my naive implementation in C# takes about 30ms iirc, i think you're doing somethign strange
 Clagus: probably allocating too much memory
 Clagus: are you using HashSet?
 Clagus: ^ PiterYeh?
 PiterYeh: i'm just using a byte[x,y,x,y]
 PiterYeh: for the distance matrix
 Clagus: whaaaaat :P
 PiterYeh: var matrix = new byte[W, H, W, H]
 pakha: is there some ressources or something that we should study, that will help&#160;?
 Clagus: PiterYeh - yeah I got it, but why such strange structure
 Clagus: and where is distance in it?
 PiterYeh: well because it gives me access to anything in constant time and it's just one allocation
 PiterYeh: var distance = matrix[A.x, A.y, B.x, B.y]
 Doju: OOOOHH
 Doju: i'm not removing super pellets!
 PiterYeh: Doju i've been there :D
 Doju: but why am i not doing it&#160;:/
 Clagus: PiterYeh - I've got a List&lt;Path&gt; :P and each path has a Origin and a List of targets with distance in it :P so it's not very optimal xD
 PiterYeh: are you storing the path too? or just the distance?
 Clagus: I was thinking about the path (that's why i called it that), but for now only distance xD
 Clagus: but plan was to store entire path too
 PiterYeh: hmm right now i do a DFS every time  i need to know the path, i should measure if it's worth to store all the paths
 Doju: How did i only notice this bug now o.o
 Clagus: Doju - yeah I had that moment too
 Doju: :D
 Clagus: when I realized my bots are actually blind xD
 Clagus: but after fixing it, I actually fall in ranking xD
 Clagus: I guess I've been optimizing things based on a invalid assumption of bots being able to see when they weren't
 Clagus: and it really struct me HOW ON EARTH i didn't notice it watching my games :D
 Doju: I'm just throwing away performance by doing clearing the super pellet cells and updating them right after
 Doju: but whatever
 Doju: erase "doing" from that sentence
 Doju: i need to go to bed
 Clagus: :D
 Clagus: i need to get out of silver league
 Clagus: but not today
 Clagus: for now the question is, how to evade enemies and not evade pellets doing that
 Doju: it's still doing it&#160;:(
 Clagus: consider writing some unit tests? it helped me in finding my "blind pacs" bug
 VicHofs: damn I missed out
 Doju: how do you do that Clagus?
 VicHofs: for two days now I'm screwed
 Doju: actually i'll just google it dont bother typing
 Clagus: xD
 SemChumboPT: Hi, back again to try and get to silver league today&#160;!!
 Clagus: good luck, been there, done that
 Clagus: implementing proper distance checking did the trick for me
 SemChumboPT: today..like tomorow, because it's almost tomorrow
 Clagus: for me it's alredy tomorrow
 Doju: there's something seriously wrong with my bfs
 Clagus: really? bfs seems like an easy stuff... i wrote my own based on wikipedia page xD
 Doju: yeah it's easy but i somehow managed to fill it with bugs
 Clagus: it's ok
 Doju: the precalc works but this thing that i do every move has a bug now&#160;:/
 VicHofs: Doju u get to silver bro?
 Doju: VicHofs yup
 VicHofs: dang
 VicHofs: care to share what got u in? lol
 Doju: sure
 Doju: i just made my bfs care about other pacs
 Doju: in the sense that they are walls
 Doju: that's the single change that threw me almost 800 ranks up
 Doju: and now there's a bug in the same method :D
 VicHofs: so you just run from them?
 VicHofs: no combat?
 Clagus: i'm still using the default A* implemented by the game itself xD
 Doju: yeah
 VicHofs: hmm
 NapTown: i did that too
 VicHofs: I might try that
 VicHofs: I've been trying combat but it's not working too well
 Doju: or no
 Doju: currently i just dance in place
 VicHofs: what
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463204524">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/463204524</a>
 Clagus: for getting to silver I would recommend calculating all distances before the game
 VicHofs: ...as a joke I assume lmao
 VicHofs: Why tho Clagus
 VicHofs: cause you don't really know where the pellets and pacs are gonna be right
 Clagus: you know at the start
 Clagus: and you know always the big pellets
 VicHofs: pellets and pacs? pretty sure you don't
 Doju: who had the brilliant idea of blocking the ide when you open the previously submitted verions
 Doju: versions
 Clagus: cause they are visible outside fog of war
 VicHofs: the big pellets yeah
 VicHofs: but my BFS isn't timing out anymore
 Clagus: you know where the pacs are at the start
 Clagus: it's mirror map always
 VicHofs: so calculating distance isn't a problem rn
 VicHofs: I know Clagus but they move right lo
 Clagus: yeah yeah sure
 Clagus: :P
 VicHofs: what I'm tryna get at is like
 Clagus: I just don't care :P
 NapTown: be pretty easy if they didn't
 Clagus: NapTown Doju or dancing in place!
 Clagus: :P
 VicHofs: even if you precalc'd everything at the start, how are you implementing it throughout the game?
 NapTown: easy and entertaining
 Clagus: VicHofs I assume the pellets are there
 Clagus: ignoring enemies for now
 VicHofs: I think it'd be hard NapTown
 Clagus: and scout with my pacs
 VicHofs: Cause u wouldn't move either&#160;;)
 Clagus: if they see no pellets, i update my board
 VicHofs: huh Clagus
 NapTown: but what if you did, you win
 VicHofs: cool approach
 VicHofs: then yea NapTown
 VicHofs: What's wrong with dreamin
 Doju: VicHofs just check all the pellets for their precalculated distance and take the smallest one
 VicHofs: Yeah I thought of that but isn't it pretty much the same as just BFSing it?
 VicHofs: since you only know where pellets are if you see them at least once
 Doju: well it's actually worse
 Doju: since you can't update the walls dynamically
 Clagus: got to go, good luck people! let's all meet in gold :P
 VicHofs: My BFS isn't timing out anymore btw
 Doju: but anyway
 Doju: what did you do to it?
 Doju: no strings?
 NapTown: bye Clagus
 Doju: please tell me no strings
 VicHofs: I'll try&#160;:( Clagus
 Doju: lol NapTown xD
 VicHofs: Doju no the strings are working just fine surprisingly
 Doju: oh are you serious
 Doju: found the bug
 VicHofs: I just stuck visited nodes together in a different way
 VicHofs: yeah Doju
 VicHofs: it works
 Doju: break doesn't apparenty only exit a loop but also exits a method
 Doju: great to knwo
 Doju: how do you even exit a while loop without setting the statement as false?
 Doumaki: "HELLO WORLD"
 Doju: or condition or whatever it's called
 VicHofs: I only know this sort of BFS (the one with string concatenation) well enough because when I was doing A* for other projects I would need not only the destination node but the step order as well Doju
 NapTown: break like you just said
 VicHofs: yeah what NapTown said
 Doju: but that doesn't continue the rest of the code?
 Doumaki: what wht d u mean break in a method
 VicHofs: yes but it breaks the loop
 NapTown: after the loop yes
 Doju: whaaat
 Doju: this is the bottom third of my bfs flood fill thing
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8076d0d1-c9fb-4e20-b086-4e8dfe441a57">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8076d0d1-c9fb-4e20-b086-4e8dfe441a57</a>
 Doju: oh right that doesnt work
 NapTown: if you don't want to continue the code try return :D
 Doju: well anyways path = construct path
 Doju: (in a while loop btw)
 VicHofs: well that works only in functions tho
 Doju: then i call break
 Doju: then it should reset cells and return path
 VicHofs: sweet
 Doju: but it doesn't return path
 VicHofs: gl
 VicHofs: make sure return is after the loop
 VicHofs: if it is it should run...
 Doju: it is
 VicHofs: what the heck then
 VicHofs: is it returning anything at all
 VicHofs: or just the wrong value
 Doju: oh what
 Doju: it does run
 Doju: how can a list of cells be  reset by setting their parent and visited as none...?
 VicHofs: idk write a method for it in the class or something
 Doju: oh what the hell
 Doju: its not the resetting method
 NapTown: in a method, make new lists for that stuff every call 
 Doju: sorry i already have the method 
 Doju: i was wondering how it's possible that it's doing that
 Doju: but apparently it's not
 Doju: seriously whatt
 rcar: debugging someone else's code over chat seems like hell
 Doju: path = self.construct_path(start, child)
 NapTown: it's not fun&#160;:)
 Doju: break
 Doju: return path
 Doju: and it returns none
 Doju: but if i just do return self.construct_path(start, child)
 Doju: it returns the path
 Doju:&#160;:|
 VicHofs: kinda but helping is cool so whatever rcar&#160;:)
 VicHofs: -so is getting help-
 rcar: I'm all for helping and being helped, but it's usually easier when you can see code
 Doju: that was the code lmao
 VicHofs: tru but we can't share right
 Doju: OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH
 rcar: I don't know the exact rules, but I'd assume you can share small blocks
 Doju: wait no
 VicHofs: why don't u implement it without the variable name then Doju
 NapTown: little bits is fine i think
 VicHofs: if it works that way
 Doju: VicHofs people say returning from multiple spot is the root of all evil
 Doju: spots
 VicHofs: you did that?
 Doju: why cant i speak english
 Doju: huh
 VicHofs: did you figure something out?
 Doju: apparently python doesn't like the variable name "path"
 rcar: path is a fine variable name
 CodingCarter: lol no it's probably already used somewhere
 rcar: it's not a reserved word in the language
 CodingCarter: maybe an imported module...?
 VicHofs: pretty sure it isn't
 Doju: actually i dont think it's the name
 Doju: but still returning from the middle works
 rcar: break works as people have described, so you probably just have a bug somewhere else
 rcar: if returning from the middle does what you need, just do it
 VicHofs: you know what I always say is
 VicHofs: if it works,
 VicHofs: don't mess with it
 Doju: does break run to the end of that iteration of the loop?
 rcar: break ends a loop immediately
 rcar: continue ends an iteration of a loop and starts the next one
 Doju: i shouldn't waste your time
 Doju: just forget about it
 Doju: i'll find it on my own
 rcar: you should just share the one function you're trying to debug
 Doju: uuhhh
 Doju: should i?
 VicHofs: I'd say it's fine honestly
 VicHofs: what the heck is anyone supposed to gain by that lol
 Doju: well, it's a mostly working bfs function
 Doju: actually i think i know the reason
 Doju: or
 Doju: umm maybe not
 Doju: def bfs_to_criteria(self, start, value_criteria, block_criteria=block_criteria): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/08e7d46b-5b28-4b20-8e72-072dfc55f3fa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/08e7d46b-5b28-4b20-8e72-072dfc55f3fa</a>
 Doju: still doesnt work
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/bc3ZcG9">https://imgur.com/bc3ZcG9</a>
 Doju: oh and
 Doju: i introduced another issue just there
 Doju: just_output_this_path_pls is just_output_the_correct_path_pls
 Doju: i mean the other way around xd
 NapTown: so you're doing bfs and want the path from start to end yes?
 Doju: yup
 Xlos: Wow, after hours of trying to find a bfs function, I can steal this guys code
 NapTown: why not keep track of parents and then walk back after?
 Xlos: what a scrub
 NapTown: also you don't need dequeue
 Doju: that's what im doing naptown
 Doju: construct path does that
 NapTown: oh ok
 Doju: and that outputs the correct path when instead of just_output_this_path_pls = self.construct_path(start, child)
 NapTown: where you have break just return construct_path?
 Doju: i do return self.construct_path(start, child)
 Doju: yeah it works but why
 Doju: it does nothing else than print a thing
 Doju: and i can even comment that out
 NapTown: it's printing the type of your path probably
 pmor: I'm not a python guy, but doesn't your break, just break out of the for...you'll still be looping in the while
 pmor:&#160;?
 Doju: OH
 Doju: you're right
 Doju: or at least there's no other sensible thing
 NapTown: that's right, so return instead of break and try printing there
 Doju: i don't really need to print
 Doju: ill just look at the pacs
 NapTown: probably easier to print it but you do you
 Doju: hard to really see whats going on when printing
 pmor: unittest&#160;:)
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: now it's fine though
 Doju: returning from the middle of the loop
 NapTown: you'll get some null paths also, since you are blocking paths, fyi
 Doju: and summoning some demons by doing that
 Doju: yeah i know
 Doju: but thanks
 Doju: thanks everybody for being patient with me&#160;:)
 NapTown: good luck&#160;:)
 rcar: stepped away for a sec but it seems like you got it now?
 Doju: yeah, the break only got out of an inner loop
 rcar: haha yeah, it'll do that
 Doju: and so it gave the furthest pellet
 Doju: well hey, that's an unintended function
 Doju: quite an excuisite looking map
 Doju: seed=2915771865364200400
 NapTown: not bad
 drykberg: cant figure out a logic to compare current pac location against some old location... ^^
 drykberg: maybe im done for the day
 NinjaDoggy: does anyone know exactly how collisions work?
 NinjaDoggy: when collisions occur between 3 or 4 pacmen?
 pmor: you can look at the code on github, but it's pretty wonky
 muy31: what drykberg you trying to extrapolate the othe pac's move?
 Zandy156: more than 2 pacs would mean that at  least 2 would be on the same team so all from that team would be blocked and so would any of the opponents that share a type with any other pac in the collision. How I understand it.
 drykberg: no, im a beginner and was advised to give this a go anyhow. Im trying to make my pacs turn the other way when they collide. Currently they bump into each other indefinitely.
 drykberg: although now i have the problem that after 30 seconds or so the pac_count suddelny goes up to 25 and my thing crashes
 drykberg: up until round 23 i print the correct pac_count of the match, then in round 24 it says pac_count 1 and then pac_count 25
 drykberg: overflow?
 Toeler: That sounds like you're reading the wrong number of lines for something
 drykberg: well, im just using the default loop that passes in pac_count. 
 drykberg: if i have 2 pac, then it correctly logs 2 until 10-20 rounds into the game
 drykberg: yes, i think my oldposition[round] array was too small, at size 10 it crashed after 10 rounds, at size 20 after 20 rounds, and at size 100 after roughly 100 rounds
 cegprakash: i'm stuck in silver
 cegprakash: anything I can do to target better pellets?
 cegprakash: I still go to the closest one
 Durkin: Do you target the big pellets to start?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: I do that
 cegprakash: I'm rank 218 at Silver
 cegprakash: I also collaborate well and counter opponents
 cegprakash: but going to closest pellet doesn't seem to be optimal
 Icebox: then you should be top 10
 cegprakash: I don't assume enemy moves
 Icebox: I'm going to closest pellet and don't counter opponents, my last valid submit was 49th xD
 Icebox: in gold
 cegprakash: oh
 Zandy156: wow I took the opposite approach 
 cegprakash: counter in the sense.. defend
 cegprakash: I assume opponent kills me if he can in next turn and I assume opponent uses switch
 cegprakash: when I am about to kill him
 Icebox: yes I understood that
 Zandy156: I'm still trying to improve my pellet gathering efficiency. Do you at least keep track of pellets that aren't visible? 
 cegprakash: yes I assume every invisible pellet as visible
 cegprakash: and change visibility after what I see
 cegprakash: when I mean going to closest pellet it may not be in vision but I assumed a pellet should be there
 Icebox: there are absolutely no problems with that approach
 Zandy156: then yeah I'd say that is optimal quite often
 cegprakash: I don't know what I'm missing then
 cegprakash: rank 219/758 in silver
 Zandy156: do your pacs stay close to each other?
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: should they?
 cegprakash: like I don't mind staying closer though
 Zandy156: not with the colsest pellet technique
 cegprakash: if u want pacs to spread out I think I can't target closest pellet 
 BenjaminUrquhart: my pacs spread just fine with closest pellet smh
 Durkin: do you value deadends less than other paths (Could similarly devalue points as they get closer to a different pac perhaps)? doing that personally and found it helped. 
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: but u are only 20 ranks above me with that
 cegprakash:&#160;:|
 cegprakash: there is something big we are missing
 Icebox: literally the first replay I looked at
 Icebox: and your movement is whole new level of bugged
 cegprakash: I'm wasting so many turns going to closest pellet and walking empty handed 
 Icebox: you're moving one step with speed 2
 Icebox: with million pellets around you
 Icebox: watch your replays as often as you ask in chat and you'll get legend no prob :D
 cegprakash: so when I'm in speed 2 I must always move 2 steps?
 cegprakash: yes I prefer to move 1 step
 cegprakash: but not sure if it would make a big deal
 Icebox: so you prefer taking 1 pellet instead of 2?
 Hjax: if you only move 1 step you might as well not use speed
 Icebox: ^
 Hjax:  you are wasting your speed by moving 1 
 Waffle3z: you aren't required to move 2 steps but whatever position you pass to the move command you'll move 2 steps toward it
 Jay_Jayjay: Well, suppose you're in a dead end with a pellet ahead. It would be useful if you could go there and back in the same turn with speed
 Icebox: yeah that's not possible
 daffie: for me when my pacs don't have speed activated it's sort of like they are only allowed to move every other turn, 
 Icebox: but also not relevant
 Icebox: his pacs are literally eating pellets in a line
 daffie: but it's still 1 space per turn as far as I know
 Icebox: one pellet per turn
 Icebox: with 2 speed
 Icebox: which makes like 0 sense
 daffie: yea it's 1 per turn, but probably the 2nd turn is the same turn still
 daffie: it just looks like 2 turns on the screen
 Icebox: no daffie, unfortunately it is not
 Icebox: and yes I'm aware what you're talking about
 daffie: ah nvm then
 Icebox: the rest of the pacs move with his pacs staying
 cegprakash: do u havae that replay?
 cegprakash: it shouldn't be happening
 Icebox: you said you like moving 1 per turn :D
 Icebox: I thought that's intentional
 cegprakash: I have an eval
 cegprakash: which chooses it
 cegprakash: so need to check why it chose it
 cegprakash: may be it thinks after picking this pellet it has to come back
 cegprakash: so it's better to move back
 cegprakash: which is not possible
 cegprakash: so do it next turn
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463219903">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463219903</a>Frame 25, you move 1 step (pressumably not to suicide in dead end?) and then suicide in dead end on the next turn :D
 Icebox: id 0
 Icebox: I saw this in like 3 replays of yours
 Icebox: it's really not that uncommon
 Icebox: I assume you lose like half of your games because of this
 cegprakash: what u mean he will eat me
 Icebox: he eats you anyway
 cegprakash: if I go there
 cegprakash: mm
 Icebox: you won't have speed on the next turn
 Icebox: it doesn't matter what you do
 Icebox: you're dead anyway
 cegprakash: mm.. let me force a step 2 move
 cegprakash: see what happens
 Valiant_Wolf: cursory guess is that it's picking its current position as the target when it stops, then dodges into the dead end when threatened
 Valiant_Wolf: wouldn't have known not to start down the dead end because the enemy wasn't in sight when it did
 cegprakash: should I avoid accidents?
 Icebox: still does not explain his magic 1 step
 Icebox: the trap is not the problem Valiant_Wolf
 cegprakash: I submitted with forcing step 2 on speed
 Valiant_Wolf: ah, but the speed just wore off didn't it?
 Icebox: nope he had 1 more left
 o_imej: guys what's the best way to avoid my pacs to block each other&#160;? 
 o_imej: my way is to naive
 Valiant_Wolf: oh, yeah, so you're right
 cegprakash: u can't go up and down on same turn 
 Icebox: you're not supposed to
 drykberg: 11 hours later and my pacs choose a new target pellet if they are blocked
 cegprakash: when he has speed
 cegprakash: I assume he will eat me
 cegprakash: by moving 2 steps
 drykberg: makes you wonder if i am lacking what it takes
 thethiny: you're cracka lackin
 drykberg: lacka de cracka schmackin
 Valiant_Wolf: o_imej people seem to be using all kinds of map interpretations; my method is to prevent pacs from moving into a space if a friendly pac has already calculated it should move into that space this turn
 Valiant_Wolf: consider where the pacs will be, not where they are now
 drykberg: how would you know where they will be?
 Valiant_Wolf: well if you've decided on a move for a friendly pac already then you know exactly where it's going to go
 o_imej: no there's a bug with my code in intersections
 drykberg: one thing after another...
 o_imej: my method is if the distance &lt;= 1 i turn to other side, but doesn't seem to work all the time 
 Valiant_Wolf: there are two ways to cause a bump
 Valiant_Wolf: two pacs try to swap positions (distance = 1)
 Valiant_Wolf: two pacs try to move into the same space (distance = 2)
 thethiny: Guys did the serve change its behavior?
 thethiny: Flood Fill for 12x33 in 0.28857994079589844s
 thethiny: in the morning it was 0.7
 VicHofs: idk but I stopped timing out for what it's worth
 thethiny: that's what I'm saying
 thethiny: they either upgraded a server or sth else changed
 thethiny: on another note, can you guys give me a 17x35 map?
 VicHofs: a seed you mean?
 BenWo: maybe they did an upgrade or added to the load pool&#160;?
 BenWo: this challenge has been quite popular
 thethiny: @VicHofs yes a seed
 thethiny: @BenWo looks like it
 BenWo: here's a 17x33:-8826700466890008600
 thethiny: if you don't mind
 BenWo: one sec, just found one
 BenWo: 17x35:
 BenWo: or preferably, a 35x17&#160;;)
 BenWo: another:8679062213686104100

 VicHofs: wym infinite loop?
 thethiny: look at the warps
 thethiny: they're connected

 BenWo: have you seen more than 4 tunnels?
 thethiny: I've seen 3 max lol
 BenWo: here: -1480812346427365380max size, 4 pacs, 4 tunnels
 VicHofs: how are you guys dealing with pacs going in the same general direction?
 BenWo: currently, I'm not&#160;:-P
 VicHofs: you in silver?
 BenWo: yep
 VicHofs: bruh lol
 BenWo: yeah it's on my list
 VicHofs: idk how to improve anymore to get to silver
 BenWo: the only thing I did was make sure my pacs can't pick the same destination
 VicHofs: yeah I did that too
 VicHofs: did you make sure that the one that keeps the destination is the closest?
 BenWo: my next rewrite is a full pathing change.... again....
 VicHofs: cause I didn't and I think it might be a problem
 BenWo: no I didn't
 BenWo: it's very situational whether that's good or bad
 VicHofs: what'd u implement to get to silver if you don't mind sharing lol
 VicHofs: cause I'm out of ideas in any plausible conceptual universe lmao
 BenWo: pretty plain BFS to find pellets, give super pellets top priority at the start (though that's not perfect currently)
 BenWo: don't path right past, or into, a pac that can kill you
 VicHofs: damn
 VicHofs: I already have that but I
 BenWo: and some basic defensive switching
 VicHofs: 'm 1700 in Bronze lmao
 VicHofs: I have the switching too
 BenWo: which oddly looks rather offensive a lot of the time
 BenWo: I also ditch the current path as soon as I spot an enemy
 BenWo: and basically every few turns constantly
 BenWo: oh and they use speed a lot
 VicHofs: hmm interesting
 VicHofs: I use speed when cornered
 VicHofs: mostly
 VicHofs: cause using it off cooldown wasn't working
 BenWo: using speed and getting at least equal super pellets can be pretty deciding if all else is fairly equal
 VicHofs: ok ty a lot
 VicHofs: I'll try and review my stuff
 BenWo: no problem
 Hjax: you should use speed whenever its off cooldown 
 SemChumboPT: and avoid enemies when speeding&#160;:)
 SemChumboPT: because you can't change
 thethiny: Flood Fill for 17x35 in 0.8232488632202148s
 thethiny: that gives me about 0.177s
 BenWo: VicHofs I can't find your bot in the list
 thethiny: @BenWo if he's in a different list you can't
 BenWo: hm ok
 thethiny: I'm starting to see repetitive matches
 BenWo: I can see a few bronze ppl though
 VicHofs: I'm in bronze BenWo&#160;:(
 thethiny: almost all of my seeds are repetitive now
 thethiny: seed=6858087742637927400
 SemChumboPT: I'm Bronze
 thethiny: cool to test your corner meta
 ProGramp0926: I'm such a noob
 BenWo: I feel like a noob too, I've just been coding and reading since the weekend
 VicHofs: ty thethiny
 BenWo: yeah my pathing is kinda crappy
 BenWo: maybe I'll get to that rewrite if work stays slow
 Zenoscave: What is a good way out of silver?
 Zenoscave: What is the bare minimum?
 VicHofs: well I'm -literally- a noob at bot coding
 VicHofs: lmao
 BenWo: I've done one or two puzzles on here and that's about it
 elkhayder: The messaging system is new right&#160;?
 elkhayder: Ahhh
 Zenoscave: also the is world chat. Not just "people in bronze"
 VicHofs: guess I'm just dumb then Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
 SemChumboPT: you just have to beat Inky bot, and he is very predictable
 BenWo: well, you have to rank higher than him
 SemChumboPT: It's so easy that I'm still in bronze
 SemChumboPT:&#160;:)
 thethiny: @Zenoscave it's a joke, relax
 Xlos: Make sure you're tracking all the pellets so you don't get stuck at the end
 Zenoscave: here's a general pseudo to get out of bronze: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c4bec5b7-6d22-4aee-903b-2eb6a8c4188c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c4bec5b7-6d22-4aee-903b-2eb6a8c4188c</a>

 VicHofs: yep
 VicHofs: It wasn't before really
 Zenoscave: thethiny sorry. Long work day. slightly hungrt
 Zenoscave: hangry*
 Zenoscave: They usually don't turn them off until it's an issue with code pasting
 TheTwister: Guys how does people display emotes above pacs?
 Zenoscave: what language are you writing in?
 VicHofs: just append to any command
 thethiny: @Zenoscave all good man, it'd be worse if you're fasting :P
 TheTwister: @Zenoscave i am on JS.

 berries: how do you make a 2d array in python 
 berries: im switching over my code from java
 thethiny: var = []
 Zenoscave: TheTwister here's one example:console.Log(`MOVE ${pac.Id} ${target.X} ${target.Y} \u{78}`)
 thethiny: var.append( another array )
 VicHofs: why tho berries
 thethiny: I think there are issues with js
 berries: i have been advised too by someone much smarter than me lol
 thethiny: no one is smarter than you but tomorrow's you
 thethiny: else you'd never learn
 BenWo: well berries I could give ya that one, but have you googled for it?
 berries: said its much better for when you start implementing complex algorithm

 BenWo: it'd be good to have a bit more understanding how it's structured in Python
 berries: yeah i did and theres a bunch of different answers and its weirdd
 VicHofs: idk dude if you're used to a language no matter what it's usually better to stick to it
 BenWo: ok this is a one time thing!
 thethiny: @berries because in python you don't fill an array beforehand
 BenWo: gives you an array in format:list[y][x]
 thethiny: you just add on the fly
 VicHofs: I know three languages well some of which are more optimized than python
 thethiny: in our case:
 VicHofs: but I stick to python cause that's what I know best
 thethiny: as an example
 berries: thanks ben 
 thethiny: you can just do
 BenWo: ð
 thethiny: grid = []
 thethiny: for i in range(height): row = [] for j in range(width): row.append(value) grid.append(row)
 berries: okay yeah thats what i have been doing 
 thethiny: I hate this chat
 berries: it makes sense now
 VicHofs: wym thethiny
 thethiny: I can't send code
 thethiny: it says expired
 BenWo: expired?
 thethiny: yeah let me try again
 thethiny: class PathFinding: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5bd16446-d099-40b6-b1c6-7dafbccad09a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5bd16446-d099-40b6-b1c6-7dafbccad09a</a>
 thethiny: see
 SemChumboPT: there is a twich video with a guy doing a very basic aproc in python
 Zenoscave: they disabled pasting large portions of text
 thethiny: why so?
 SemChumboPT: you'll get started
 Zenoscave: they often do so in order to keep contests fair
 BenWo: oh wow, ok
 BenWo: guess I'm not too upset
 thethiny: thanks Zenos
 Zenoscave: np
 Zenoscave: been here to ask enough questions figured I should answer some eventually
 thethiny: hahaha
 thethiny: guys is there a point that we can ALWAYS guarantee it's a point?
 thethiny: I'm writing a path finding algorithm that needs a CONSTANT starting point that isn't a wall
 Zenoscave: No
 thethiny: damn
 VicHofs: I don't think so
 VicHofs: not other than pac spawns
 Hjax: thats a really weird requirement 
 Zenoscave: and pac spawns are random too
 Zenoscave: Hjax is right
 thethiny: baiscally
 thethiny: I'm trying to get the edges of the map
 thethiny: and the corners
 thethiny: in order to do so I need to scan the entire map
 thethiny: but I need a starting point
 Zenoscave: just do a scan for the first non wall edge first each time and start there
 BenWo: what's wrong with (0, 0)&#160;?
 thethiny: yes that's what I wanna do but I thought maybe there's a point
 thethiny: @BenWo if I start at 0,0 and it's a wall my algo stops
 BenWo: yeah obv, it'll be a wall
 BenWo: but start looking there
 thethiny: I'll just brute force it then
 Zenoscave: Hjax gold yet?
 thethiny: is Gold open yet??
 BenWo: yeah opened today
 Hjax: im gold yes 
 thethiny: oh nice!
 thethiny: That's why I'm 70 then (down from 200)
 Zenoscave: What's the silver-boss-to-gold meta
 VicHofs: bruh yall too good at this
 Hjax: not sure, i promoted when it was open 
 Zenoscave: Damn
 Hjax: my bot from monday was better than the boss 
 Zenoscave: I've not had much time to work on this with my job
 VicHofs: no need to rub it in Hjax
 Zenoscave: Woohoo end of sprint release cycles
 icecream17: I'm still in bronze. what's the new stuff for silver?
 Hjax: the only new thing is that it tells you when pacs are dead 
 BenWo: only 1 thing new
 Zenoscave: Theres a new type. DEAD
 Zenoscave: and you should just skip those lines
 Zenoscave: major breaker for many bots
 icecream17: wow that's really useful!
 Zenoscave: Some were complaining about id's changing between turns i believe. Can't please everyone. There's not a good way to do it
 SemChumboPT: wow i submited and got so dam down on bronze i was afraid i would get to wood again!!
 SemChumboPT: Rank 2,328 2,482...&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: You can't go back leagues. once in bronze you can only go beyond
 SemChumboPT: Zenocave, my luck then&#160;!!
 Zenoscave: but yeah dropping ranks after a 'fix' or even the same code is always at the whim of RNGesus
 VicHofs: RNGesus -always- gets me
 icecream17: hm. how does brutaltester... aw its 929 gn
 VicHofs: what
 thethiny: yes but actually no
 cegprakash: wow top 50 silver for the first time
 cegprakash: watching lot of replays helped me fix a crucial bug
 cegprakash: but now I die to random accidents
 cegprakash: no idea how to avoid accidents
 drykberg: congrats
 cegprakash: not sure if tracking opponent will help me avoid accidents
 BenWo: yeah randomly getting killed at a corner is a tough one&#160;:-/
 SemChumboPT: Lool i'm ignoring the edge of map and was killed when passed from right side to left&#160;:/
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: so avoiding corners can cause accidents too
 cegprakash: interesting
 cegprakash: I was thinking about adding choke point avoidence
 Ltrltrltr1234: hi
 cegprakash: avoidance*
 Ltrltrltr1234: Is this chat for the entire site?
 NapTown: ya
 Ltrltrltr1234: oh ok 
 Ltrltrltr1234: im having trouble with power of thor
 Ltrltrltr1234: for some reason the code to prevent him from going off the map doesnt work
 Ltrltrltr1234: got any ideas
 thethiny: what is the code you're talking about?
 thethiny: your code or their code?
 cegprakash: wait I'm #7 at 91%
 cegprakash: :D
 Ltrltrltr1234: my code
 cegprakash: so Gold is a real possibility
 thethiny: let me check, wait
 thethiny: @Ltr
 Ltrltrltr1234: Im not really good bear with me
 thethiny: okay so 
 thethiny: you have the map's coords
 Ltrltrltr1234: yeah\
 thethiny: what you need to do is on this step, you simulate the next step
 thethiny: example
 cegprakash: #3 I resubmit :D
 thethiny: if you're at 0, 0
 Ltrltrltr1234: then
 thethiny: you need to simulate that you're going to all directions
 thethiny: then whichever works, you actually go to
 Ltrltrltr1234: oh ok
 thethiny: you shouldn't first go, then you simulate
 Ltrltrltr1234: thanks for help
 thethiny: :D
 Ltrltrltr1234: :grinning:
 thethiny: guys anyone got a seed where the Big Pellet is trapped from 3 corners?
 BenWo: trapped?
 thethiny: 3 walls around it
 BenWo: you mean it's a dead-end, gotcha
 BenWo: 4881390214237379600that enough?
 MoMaT: 1737599522231088900
 thethiny: Yes thank you a lot
 cegprakash: 14% rank 11
 cegprakash: Get rekt SIlver boss coming for u
 WillNess: 36% rank 222 in bronze&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: cegprakash how many wins in first 10/
 WillNess: oh wait 51% rank 49 let's goo
 Zenoscave:&#160;?
 HKTran: 212 bronze&#160;:))
 VicHofs: WillNess still way better than me lol
 cegprakash: 9 in first 10
 Zenoscave: Ok first one is loss?
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: Rank 1 24%
 Zenoscave: gz
 Zenoscave: what did you change?
 cegprakash: changed my depth = 1 to depth=10 after fixing a silly bug
 Zenoscave: in search/simu?
 cegprakash: yea
 Zenoscave: beam?
 BenWo: dang, nice
 drykberg: how do I tell a pac to go to the nearest pellet? ^^
 WillNess: 70% rank 10 am I gonna make it??
 cegprakash: The bug was I was using a global variable instead of a local variable inside function
 VicHofs: try Breadth First Search drykberg
 thethiny: @drykberg calculate the distance to it, then move to it
 WillNess: yessssssssss
 Zenoscave: Is not turning around unless needed a good idea ceg?
 Zenoscave: I spend wasted moves going back and forth a lot
 Zenoscave: like MOVE 0 10 10 ... MOVE 0 9 10 ... MOVE 0 10 10 .. MOVE 0 9 10
 cegprakash: yes
 VicHofs: my charitable chaps who are in silver? could one of you summarize what you have going just so I have an idea?
 cegprakash: that's what got avoided in my sim
 cegprakash: I mean
 cegprakash: not really
 cegprakash: previously 2 of my own pacs go to same choke point
 cegprakash: because they are closer to those choke point
 cegprakash: but now because I have this depth I am able to figure out 1 of the pacs can take all of those
 cegprakash: so other pac will move for a different pac
 cegprakash: *different pellets
 BenWo: sounds perfect&#160;:)
 cegprakash: Zenoscave did u understand what I said
 cegprakash: or should I repeat?
 cegprakash: so I have 2 pacs closer to 5 pellets.. the problem I had was both these pacs went for these pellets
 Zenoscave: I understand
 Zenoscave: coding it now
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: I dropped boss so much.. diff between him and me is now 4 points
 cegprakash: 3 days of suffering
 VicHofs: cegprakash how u doing that?
 cegprakash: and finally here
 cegprakash: beating boss VicHofs
 MoMaT: VicHofs, you need two things: (1) get the bonus dots closest to you, (2) walk trough each tile only once (if possible) with only one unit (that is, explore without redundancy). if you have more than one choice, prioritise certain infromation (dots you see).
 VicHofs: ty MoMaT
 Zenoscave: MoMaT algo for non redundant walk? just weighted Kruskal?
 cegprakash: do u track invisible pellets Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: no
 Zenoscave: like seen previously but uneaten?
 Zenoscave: how do you make sure ops havent eaten
 MoMaT: maybe if you want to be really pro, you could use a spanning tree, but to get to silver, all you need is to make best choice at the moment you need to make a choice. even if globally it is not optimal.
 Zenoscave: Ok weighted kruskal spanning tree
 cegprakash: that's a must Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: ok thanks I think I have enough
 cegprakash: I don't make sure Zenoscave
 VicHofs: even I have that implemented lol
 cegprakash: I just assume it's still there
 cegprakash: how did you get to SIlver without Pellet tracking Zenoscave
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: hacks?
 Zenoscave: Magic
 VicHofs: cegprakash u implemented that too right
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: that's what got me to Silver
 VicHofs: do u analyze if enemy pacs ate any of them?
 cegprakash: nope
 VicHofs: I couldn't find a proper way to do it so I just ignored it and did it for mine
 cegprakash: not yet.. not sure if it's worth it
 VicHofs: oh ok
 VicHofs: ty anyway
 Ltrltrltr1234: Not sure how to do power of thor, perhaps later
 VicHofs: just trying to see what I need to focus on to get to silver
 cegprakash: Yes u need Pellet tracking
 cegprakash: Bronze is the hardest place to promote
 cegprakash: coz it's flooded 
 VicHofs: got that already&#160;:)
 VicHofs: I think my use of abilities is shitty tho
 cegprakash: only 70 games and u need to win 70% at least
 VicHofs: maybe I should give that some thought
 cegprakash: Icebox u said u are in top 50
 cegprakash: are u testing something
 Durkin: Looking at some of your loss replays, you seem to just be timing out a lot Vichofs. fixing the error in that if it's your actual current code would be massive
 VicHofs: timeouts again?
 VicHofs: guhh
 VicHofs: hate that shiz
 VicHofs: aight thanks for the heads up Durkin
 VicHofs: I thought I'd fixed that
 MoMaT: but to make it work right, you would have to use it in a line graph. personally I think it is an overkill, given the uncertainty of the information. it's better to be as flexible as possible and use speed correctly.
 ndosm: if I'm seeing the message "Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move:" , am I doing something 'wrong'? I'm not sure what the message actually means to me
 VicHofs: no it just means someone is using speed
 VicHofs: and they get an extra move round while active
 VicHofs: when only they can mve
 VicHofs: *move
 ndosm: ooh, thank you
 VicHofs: np
 VicHofs: Durkin would you happen to have one of those replays? lol
 VicHofs: I can't get it to happen anymore...
 VicHofs: (although that would be preferable)
 berries: can you have x + 1 as an argument in a function in python
 Durkin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/463269086">https://www.codingame.com/replay/463269086</a>
 berries: cant find it on google
 VicHofs: not that I know of berries
 VicHofs: but why would you
 berries: less lines of code i gues
 VicHofs: just take the argument x and do x=x+1 on the first line
 berries: yeah thats what ill do 
 VicHofs: x += 1 actually
 VicHofs: better format
 VicHofs: imo
 VicHofs: ty Durkin
 berries:  i need to retain x so im gonna do x1 = x + 1
 VicHofs: your call dude ð
 MoMaT: of course you can do f(x + 1).
 MoMaT: you can pass any expression. it will be evaluated and used by the function. it doesn't change the value of the original variable.
 VicHofs: anyone know a good timeout method for functions in python?
 VicHofs: as in "if it takes longer than x ms just break the loop and provide y"
 Icebox: put if (time &gt; limit) at the top?
 VicHofs: yeah but I mean like in dependenciess
 VicHofs: I'd just import time and do time() - start but I wanna get a second opinion
 Icebox: that's pretty much the only way
 VicHofs: ok ty
 MoMaT: import time module, there are many methods there. wall clock or CPU time based.
 VicHofs: ya was just wondering if maybe there was a timer() function or something
 VicHofs: but good old time() - start it is
 Icebox: I have never tried it on CG but generally speaking you could try it with multiprocessing
 VicHofs: the what now
 Icebox: it has process.terminate() method
 Icebox: which ends a process
 Icebox: you can time it
 Icebox: to terminate after some MS
 VicHofs: huh
 VicHofs: interesting
 Icebox: no idea if it's supported on CG though
 VicHofs: but since I'm dealing with a while loop here I think time's fine
 VicHofs: ty tho
 Icebox: it is, there are like no benefits of using it 
 Icebox: unless you could get your code to multithread and would get 10x performance from that
 Icebox: :shrug:
 VicHofs: lol
 VicHofs: I wish
 MoMaT: do you have more than one core though? if not, it's irrelevant.
 VicHofs: yes
 Icebox: MoMaT just checked it
 Icebox: it's unfortunately only 1 core
 Icebox: that is available to us
 VicHofs: on CG tho
 Icebox: it has hyperthreading tho
 Icebox: yeah on CG
 VicHofs: I mean for other uses
 MoMaT: OK, for a moment I though something changed.
 VicHofs: ty for the info regardless
 VicHofs: nah that's not what I meant MoMaT
 VicHofs: sry lol
 MoMaT: hyperthreadin is just marketing. you get maybe 10% more speed. not 2x more.
 VicHofs: why can't I see the full stderr?
 VicHofs: this suckcs
 VicHofs: any way around it?
 Icebox: I don't think it's ever marketed to give 2x boost
 MoMaT: that happens when you talk to much in a chat...
 VicHofs: what does the chat have to do with it lmao
 MoMaT: with all the Intel vunerabilities like Meldown or Spectre, I wonder if HT is even enabled on CG.
 Icebox: it is
 MoMaT: I'm not so sure, the FAQ might be outdated. Do you know which IaaS is CG using?
 Icebox: it could be outdated
 Icebox: but since there was no update regarding such changes
 Icebox: I'm gonna go with old info and say it's still there
 MoMaT: but the thing is, all new Intel CPUs have it disabled by deafult. also I'm not sure CG would go so far as to build their custom kernel, and default ones would have all mitigations on.
 MoMaT: anyway, I was just wondering, it's not that I care that much.
 k3null3d: is there any way to see a clash of code solution&#160;?
 SemChumboPT: Well. it's not today that I'll get silver&#160;:(
 VicHofs: SemChumboPT same dude
 SemChumboPT: I'l try again tomorrow
 VicHofs: I feel ya
 VicHofs: good luck!
 SemChumboPT: Made so many changes and got even worse... tomorow i'll get it&#160;!!
 SemChumboPT: I hope
 VicHofs: boa sorte&#160;:)
 SemChumboPT:&#160;;)
 shashwat986: k3null3d only if a solver shares their code

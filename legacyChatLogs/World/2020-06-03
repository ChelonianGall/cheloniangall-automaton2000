 Imsure1200q: a
 Imsure1200q: hmm
 Imsure1200q: in spacemaze it got timeout even if it didnt reach 1500 ms
 Imsure1200q: is c++ faster than javascript in here
 Scarfield: yes c++ is faster Imsure1200q
 Scarfield: and also if you havent noticed: 
 Imsure1200q: oh ok thanks
 Scarfield: oh. dont mind the times, i thought you said Search Race, not space mace xD
 Imsure1200q: but is python slower than c++ or not
 Scarfield: yes, much slower
 Imsure1200q: wait but when i asked astro he said its faster?
 Scarfield: c++ is faster than python
 Imsure1200q: like i think also euler i asked
 AZX: C++ is the fastest language i
 Imsure1200q: and they said that python is 10x faster than c++ or smth in the IDE
 AZX: since you can control memory
 Scarfield: they must have been trolling, usually they are very hellpful, might have misunterstood your question
 Imsure1200q: but i asked like multiple times
 Imsure1200q: they said that it is slow in codingame but fast anywhere else
 Imsure1200q: like is that true or no
 AZX: well ya in coding game sure it might be slower than in real life
 Scarfield: hmm C++ is in debug mode here, so it would be even faster in release mode
 Scarfield: but its still the fastest language here (C++)
 Imsure1200q: so if i run c++ code in here its faster than if i run python here
 Scarfield: yup
 Imsure1200q: ok ill port to c++
 Scarfield: for puzzles you sometimes get extra time though for slower languages
 Imsure1200q: thats possible?
 Csipcsirip: and there is some boilerpate code wich makes your c++ code almost as fast as it were compiled in "release"
 Csipcsirip: #pragma GCC optimize("-O3")
 Imsure1200q: but i dont know what gcc might do with my code
 Imsure1200q: i know about -o3 but not inline and the others
 Csipcsirip: ah ok
 Imsure1200q: will codingame show g++ compilation errors
 Imsure1200q: as is
 Csipcsirip: compilaton errors:yes
 Imsure1200q: okt hnx
 Csipcsirip: runtime errors arent very helpful these days tho
 Csipcsirip: *error messages
 Imsure1200q: yeah i guess
 Imsure1200q: i dont get any info from runtime when i compile by g++
 Imsure1200q: its only weird characters and directories&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: ugh javascript being weird rn
 Imsure1200q: acting as if there's such thing as "pass by reference" is this an interpreter bug
 K4Mx: test
 daffie: re reloading the page
 daffie: try*
 Imsure1200q: no doesnt work
 Imsure1200q: i think i will port to c++ soon
 Imsure1200q: javascript is getting too messy
 Imsure1200q: ugh it keeps on passing by reference  but it javascript its impossible
 Imsure1200q: how to contact developers or smth
 Astrobytes: "Imsure1200q 07:14AMwait but when i asked astro he said its faster?"
 Astrobytes: Dude wtf are you talking about
 Imsure1200q: python being faster than c++
 Astrobytes: Yeah em... that was *not* me
 Imsure1200q: wait your not the one who said that?
 Imsure1200q: oh well
 Astrobytes: It was that Lelouch guy
 Imsure1200q: so since when did javascript do pass by reference
 Astrobytes: I don't do JS like I said 100 times, but as far as I remember it passes primitevs by value and objects as references 
 Astrobytes: and arrays
 Astrobytes: or something like that
 Astrobytes: I thought you knew JS
 Imsure1200q: yeah but last time i learned it
 Imsure1200q: 3 years ago
 Astrobytes: Right. 
 Imsure1200q: it probably updated but like im so used to everything passed by value
 Astrobytes: And how many years ago did you learn C++
 Imsure1200q: like 2 months
 Imsure1200q: what i did instead to take out the reference is VALUE + 0
 Imsure1200q: but then i have to do that for every obj so instead im porting to C++ which is less confusing
 Astrobytes: I see.
 Astrobytes: So you've written your algorithm then
 Imsure1200q: I think it will overload the runner/codingame/whatever runs th code
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Astrobytes: Overload?
 Astrobytes: It's too slow?
 Imsure1200q: im still working on the "raycasting" part of the alg and, by seeing the logs, its so much iterations
 Imsure1200q: but i dont know cuz i havent measured the actual speed of it
 Astrobytes: You're ray casting in Space Maze
 Imsure1200q: ys
 Astrobytes: I see.
 Imsure1200q: but its not the raycasting for graphics its just ray casting
 Imsure1200q: like u know
 Astrobytes: I know what ray casting is.
 mellololos: im lagging it is network problem?
 Imsure1200q: maybe
 Imsure1200q: i restarted my pc and no lag anymore
 Imsure1200q: the steps i have so far are1. convert fixed platforms into solidAnd then after that step i have like 2-3 methods which i havent decided which one is the best
 Imsure1200q: And the first method overloaded&#160;:)
 SunwooKimw: Hello
 Imsure1200q: hi
 jrke: hi
 Imsure1200q: lol how do you split a string without making it a constant
 Uljahn: pls stop spamming the chat with google search queries
 Imsure1200q: when did i spam?
 Astrobytes: So you were going to write a NN for Space Maze, or use A*, now you're going to use er... ray casting - and you can't split a string?
 jrke: hey astrobytes
 Imsure1200q: no the raycasting is part of the alg but not the alg itself
 Astrobytes: Hey jrke
 Imsure1200q: i ported back to javascript because the only thing im confused lately with c++ is strings and everything is strings in codingame
 Imsure1200q: And im not doing raycasting anymore bcuz overload
 Uljahn: jeez
 Astrobytes: ikr
 Imsure1200q:&#160;:)
 jrke: astrobytes can't check if checkpoint is crossed or not
 jrke: means collision time
 Astrobytes: Like I was saying yesterday, you're gonna have to implement the collision system from the game source code
 jrke: K
 Astrobytes: If you want your simulation to be accurate
 jrke: ya 
 Astrobytes: Otherwise your eval won't work as expected
 jrke: thats why im getting 14600 time
 jrke: one change in eval system changes my whole outcome
 cegprakash: hey Astrobytes
 cegprakash: that's not neded to get to top 20
 cegprakash: at least for me
 cegprakash: distance to checkpoint &lt; 600 and updating checkpoint in each turn is sufficient for top 20
 cegprakash: my rank 13 bot doesn't use the collision code from referee
 cegprakash: it still checks distance to checkpoint &lt; 600 but I run it every 0.2 turns
 Astrobytes: :shrug:
 Astrobytes: I prefer accuracy over sufficiency. Your mileage may vary&#160;;)
 Uljahn: not sure if it's faster than finding ray-circle intersection though
 Astrobytes: afk, on phone
 Astrobytes: Sure, I mean implementation-dependent ofc but yeah. cegprakash: can you help jrke out, I think it's either an implementation issue somewhere in the search or eval - donno
 Astrobytes: *or an issue in his eval
 Astrobytes: ffs, afk again

 Imsure1200q: maybe he doesnt know how to speak english?
 Imsure1200q: typing random stuff and composing random phrases is somethings a non-fluent english speaker tends to do
 Imsure1200q: in an english channel
 Astrobytes: So many phonecalls this morning, my ear is burning
 WINWINWIN: No, his school is english based
 Astrobytes: hi WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: hey Astrobytes

 Csipcsirip: hey. do you know guys any multi that is more simple than oware? 
 struct: yes
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough</a>
 Csipcsirip: oh no. to many inputs. I want to test my alpha zero implementation
 Astrobytes: Why not Oware?
 struct: many inputs?
 struct: ah ok
 struct: I see
 struct: maybe Yavalath? :p
 Csipcsirip: even more inputs... I need the most simple game possible, so I can be 100% sure if something is wrong its the alphazero module. yavalath looks simple, with a game that has ~8x8 inputs training can take days or even weeks on cpu
 struct: ok wait I have 1 perfect
 struct: let me find
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c</a>
 Astrobytes: Is your Oware bot alphazero already Csipcsirip?
 Csipcsirip: no, mcts
 Astrobytes: Ah. Robo's is alphazero, he used Oware because it was the simplest game&#160;;)
 struct: Connect 4 might be simple right?
 Astrobytes: Minimal input + simple rules.
 Csipcsirip: haha yes, it's the simplest I've found yet
 Astrobytes: I think it's your best option currently
 struct: I never released it because its preety much solved
 Astrobytes: struct, Connect 5? 6?
 jacek: paper soccer looks simple enough
 Csipcsirip: It has a grid with size like 20x20, no&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Is jacek advertising paper soccer an official CG meme yet?
 jacek: nope
 Csipcsirip: ah okay so I've been trolled
 jacek: nope
 struct: Astrobytes the problem is that is like 1 more mcts game
 struct: I think there are enough games like that already
 Astrobytes: Do you wish to make more True AI games?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: ConnectN with FOW
 Astrobytes: And no statement
 Astrobytes: Or viewer
 struct: also moves are randomized
 Astrobytes: Perfect
 jacek: and you can swap any turn
 jacek: most fair
 Astrobytes: And steal move.
 Imsure1200q: ha
 Astrobytes: Finished your ray casting Space Maze solver yet?
 Imsure1200q: lol no its not raycasting
 Imsure1200q: anymore
 Imsure1200q: im going for the pathfinding but my code is messy so cleaning it up
 Imsure1200q: also optimizing it
 WINWINWIN: Did you do space maze Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Nah. I think only 4 or 5 people have completed it
 detonavomek: hi everyone, is this Code Royale or godingame chat?
 struct: codingame chat
 detonavomek: thank you
 jacek: yes
 gobber: hi
 gobber: gtg
 jrke: hey astrobytes my sim worked best time 12350 rank 21
 Astrobytes: Nice jrke, good work!
 Astrobytes: Next you have to beat ceg :D
 jrke: i did some changes in eval system and solved checkpoint crossed 
 jrke: ya i will&#160;;)
 jrke: ceg first in india im second 
 Astrobytes: Nice. Get 1st&#160;:)
 gobber: cool
 Csipcsirip: yay my alphazero bot beats the mcts one
 solaimanope: Where can I find good tutorial for MCTS?
 Astrobytes: grats Csipcsirip, yet another NN to wreck me :P
 Csipcsirip: ty. it's in torch yet, have to implement CG inference
 struct: Where Csipcsirip?
 Csipcsirip: I haven't found any decent MCTS tutorial. the whitepaper isnt that hard to understand to. and you can implement it in 200 lines if you understand it
 Csipcsirip: oware
 jrke: hey astrobytes my mutation was a bug so removed it so can u tell is this ok
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da343351-2026-4ac6-9b95-11144a44662f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da343351-2026-4ac6-9b95-11144a44662f</a>
 Uljahn: easy start for MCTS is with MAB and UCB1 i guess
 Uljahn: goto mutated :scream_cat:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, wow, goto jrke!
 Astrobytes: You need to escape from a nested loop?
 struct: I never used goto 
 struct: I didnt even know it existed
 jrke: no for re-evalution i used goto statement
 jrke: its there in c++ struct goto label;
 Astrobytes: Can be alright to escape nested loops, either that or use a sentinel value
 Astrobytes: jrke, there must be another way
 tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/">https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide/</a> i got it after pseudocode in the end
 Astrobytes: But hey, if it works for you
 OverStack: hi, i just finished my firsft clash of code, and i don't have any success is it normal&#160;?
 OverStack: i waited the 15 minutes for it to end
 darkhorse64: Hey struct, why don't you polish a bit your Connect4, increase the size (because the game is solved) to 7 x 9 and publish it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I suggested earlier darkhorse64, but struct thinks we don't need another MCTS game
 struct: I could port it if more people want it, I dont mind
 darkhorse64: It's a popular one. It may attract people
 Astrobytes: OverStack "don't have any success" - you got less than 100% or you didn't submit your answer?
 struct: Do you want Connect N?
 WINWINWIN: Yes&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: connect2
 darkhorse64: Is it playable&#160;? I mean, 6 in a row can be realized in a game&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: on a 2x2 board
 Astrobytes: connect1 ftw
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: Who posted that troll thread with all the connect4 memes? That was funny 
 darkhorse64: I'd go for something simple 
 struct: Well kaggle has Connect X

 struct: Seems like it always is 4 in arow
 jrke: astrobytes 19th now
 Astrobytes: Getting closer to ceg jrke, gogogo
 jrke: yup
 darkhorse64: GA / distance to CP&#160;?
 Astrobytes: random + mutation afaik darkhorse64 
 darkhorse64: same as ceg, actually
 darkhorse64: except for collisions
 Astrobytes: Yeah, mutation was ceg's suggestion&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: ceg said he doesn't do collisions
 darkhorse64: Yeah, he samples whether he crosses the CP. Dunno how it can work but results are here
 Astrobytes: This is the way that jrke went in the end on ceg's advice
 Astrobytes: I believe
 jrke: yup 
 Astrobytes: as long as it works, right?
 darkhorse64: Honestly, that makes no sense to me. Checking distances every 0.2s does not guarantee at all that you can detect you cross the CP
 jrke: but he last suggested me at 5 pm and i made my sim worked at 7pm&#160;;)
 jrke: bye gtg
 Astrobytes: later jrke
 darkhorse64: gg
 Astrobytes: ceg always takes the path of least resistance, you probably noticed that already&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: OK but it cannot work
 Astrobytes: I don't get it either.
 Astrobytes: I'm never explaining anything ever again. Just wastes my time
 OverStack: Astrobytes i was first and had 100%, but the next one i did worked and gave me the success
 darkhorse64: On something like Tokyo drift where you barely touch the CP
 Astrobytes: Maybe just a glitch OverStack
 Astrobytes: He must be using something else that compensates for that strange method darkhorse64, or it just wouldn't work at all
 Astrobytes: Well, not very well anyway
 Imsure1200q: m
 AntiSquid: kaggle replays don't load for me, do they work for anyone else? struct eulerscheZahl i see you linked it, are you doing kaggle&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have an account on kaggle
 struct: They work for me AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: they work for me, but it was in reference to struct doing a connect n game
 struct: I dont have an account
 eulerscheZahl: but i can watch the replays
 Imsure1200q: Euler does spacemaze score based on how efficient it is?
 Imsure1200q: based on number of moves
 AntiSquid: oh kaggle gives you replay download button with json ...
 eulerscheZahl: you just have to get every testcase green Imsure1200q. it's a puzzle, not an optimization game
 AntiSquid: ok weird, it works on opera but not on firefox, i don't get it
 Imsure1200q: okay thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i only tested with chromium
 Astrobytes: Yeah just has a loading icon on FF, works fine for me in Chrome + Opera
 AntiSquid: Agade #50 on that leaderboard btw
 AntiSquid: right at the bottom
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you don't click to show 342 more
 AntiSquid: didn't mean he is the worst, just saying where to find him :p
 eulerscheZahl: i found him too. my first thought was that he is last :D
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/agade09">https://www.kaggle.com/agade09</a> i mean he done the humpback whale challenge 1 year ago, at 1400/2000 or so, so clearly not serious about kaggle

 eulerscheZahl: the one linked 47min before you asked
 Astrobytes: :P
 Illedan: outside my chat history :P
 eulerscheZahl: how far does your chat history go? :P

 Imsure1200q: ok since when
 Illedan: lol jacek
 Illedan: Wonder what would be good enough to pay for it :thinking:
 Illedan: Unlimited submits?
 Illedan: Priority on submit?
 Illedan: Advantages in games? :D
 WINWINWIN: what is codingame premium?
 eulerscheZahl: or just supporting the website without any benefits
 Imsure1200q: oh no its a s c am

 cegprakash: jrke #19 without mutation
 cegprakash: xD
 Astrobytes: It's his magic goto ceg
 cegprakash: he uses goto? :P 
 eulerscheZahl: goto rank 19;
 WINWINWIN: which multi?
 Astrobytes: cegprakash:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da343351-2026-4ac6-9b95-11144a44662f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da343351-2026-4ac6-9b95-11144a44662f</a>

 cegprakash: someone teach jrke classes he still uses struct
 cegprakash: sorry for tagging u struct I meant c++ struct
 eulerscheZahl: i know the comic without clicking
 struct: What is wrong with structs?
 Astrobytes: Nothing wrong with struct
 struct: struct is just a public class
 Astrobytes: obviously eulerscheZahl, it's named "goto.png"
 JBM: don't link to the png&#160;:(
 JBM: makes us miss the title text
 cegprakash: Astrobytes I told him to stop mutating
 cegprakash: and u show me mutate&#160;:\
 Astrobytes: Sorry, ripped it off thibpats discord server
 WINWINWIN: cegprakash which multi?
 cegprakash: search race
 Astrobytes: I think he turned it off or something ceg, not 100% sure
 WINWINWIN: Ahh, he told me he was going to make a sim, but I dont think that he had a solution pool
 cegprakash: he said he turned it off
 Astrobytes: but that goto eh&#160;:)
 cegprakash: just random is giving him nice results
 cegprakash: and he uses depth 7
 Astrobytes: I know
 cegprakash: I'm already thinking about changing classes to struct
 cegprakash: older the faster right?
 Astrobytes: there's no difference other than accessibility, classes are private by default, structs are public
 cegprakash: jrke is #19 without mutation :O 
 struct: yes struct gives much more performance /s
 cegprakash: have u benchmarked struct?
 WINWINWIN: Has he even used pragma?
 cegprakash: no jrke is #19 without pragmas
 AntiSquid: i think there's a difference with the forward declaration of structs compared to classes
 cegprakash: his code is just 100 lines in search race
 cegprakash: I've a pleb 300 lines of code
 cegprakash: with classes and functions
 cegprakash: he has only 1 function apart from main
 cegprakash: :D
 Astrobytes: Not that I know of AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: then i am mixing things up
 cegprakash: more like he inlined everything without using an inline
 Imsure1200q: c++ is better for A*?
 AntiSquid: in what way?
 Imsure1200q: for backtracking once you have a solution
 JBM: ah i see it now right
 Imsure1200q: c++ has pointers but javascript and others dont have
 JBM: that explains it all right
 Imsure1200q: uhh jbm who u talking to lol
 JBM: i wonder
 Imsure1200q: &gt;:)))
 Astrobytes: Yay for punctuation...
 Astrobytes: Symbols ftw
 Astrobytes: Finished yet Imsure1200q?
 Illedan: So, 43 games on avg per submit eulerscheZahl? :P 
 Imsure1200q: haha (flashbacks about how bad websites explained A* and there was only one good one) no
 Astrobytes: I told you to look at redblobgames
 Imsure1200q: i dont think the redblobgames helped
 Astrobytes: It's even interactive ffs
 Astrobytes: If you can't understand it from that...
 Imsure1200q: the redblobgames was about nodes like 1 to 1.4 unit away from each other
 Astrobytes: Are you high?
 Imsure1200q: but there was another site that explained it preety wel
 Imsure1200q: no im not high
 Imsure1200q: not allowed to take... things..
 Astrobytes: I thought you said you 'knew' A* anyway, but no other pathfinding algorithms
 Astrobytes: Something about only knowing A* and binary search
 Imsure1200q: i thought i knew it cuz i learned it before but turns out the source that i learned it was incomplete
 Imsure1200q: it didnt cover the "node = state" thingy
 Astrobytes: Welp. Good luck with Space Maze.
 eulerscheZahl: wood has less games Illedanor spam submits without waiting till the end
 Imsure1200q: yah im making progress&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: i use geeksforgeeks Imsure1200q
 Imsure1200q: hold on lemme search for it
 AntiSquid: what other site did you use then that explained it well&#160;?
 Imsure1200q: imo this one did <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://heyes-jones.com/astar.php">http://heyes-jones.com/astar.php</a>
 Imsure1200q: but i also like the geeks one thnx
 Astrobytes: Well, I tried to introduce you to pathfinding step by step with redblobgames, BFS, Dijkstra etc
 cegprakash: A* looks like BFS
 Astrobytes: You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink
 cegprakash: I've never used A*
 cegprakash: how is A* diff from BFS
 JBM: start comparing to dijkstra instead of bfs
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html</a>
 Imsure1200q: but why bfs tho?
 Astrobytes: Step by step, from bfs-&gt;dijkstra-&gt;astar
 cegprakash: dijkstra we use priority_queue 
 cegprakash: instead of queue
 JBM: do you know why?
 Imsure1200q: no
 JBM: sort that out first then
 Imsure1200q: i dont even know whats priority_queue
 Imsure1200q: im using javascript
 Imsure1200q: is that a c++ library?
 Astrobytes: I've been trying to get this guy to learn basic pathfinding all week. He wants to solve Space Maze

 JBM: which guy?
 Imsure1200q: me
 JBM: oh that guy
 JBM: good luck
 tomatoes: it's data structure
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I give up.
 Imsure1200q: okay
 AntiSquid: maybe do something easier first Imsure1200q
 Astrobytes: no, we tried to get him to do that already. 
 Imsure1200q: yeah
 Imsure1200q: i mean i guess its pointless bcuz at one point i will get bored and go back to the hard questions
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/pathfinding">https://www.codingame.com/learn/pathfinding</a> scroll down, there are other ones related
 AntiSquid: but can you even solve the easier ones?
 Astrobytes: euler linked him the Forest Fire one the other day
 eulerscheZahl: because it has a nice animation but is easier
 Imsure1200q: oh yeah that one
 AntiSquid: "got bored of the easy because i couldn't solve it so i went to the harder ones"&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Doesn't like puzzles without animations.
 Imsure1200q: ye
 eulerscheZahl: likes math but no formulas
 Astrobytes: ^
 Imsure1200q: ahh lol no
 Imsure1200q: * likes math but no reading formulas
 Astrobytes: Likes pathfinding without pathfinding
 Imsure1200q: yes
 AntiSquid: then play kutulu
 Imsure1200q: whats that
 AntiSquid: or code a la mode / pacman, they do the pathing for you
 Imsure1200q: lol not right now
 AntiSquid: this is the best time to pick and easir one and solve it
 AntiSquid: an *
 Astrobytes: Why don't you build a CNN A* ray-casting super algo
 Imsure1200q: but seriously the only reason why i've been able to grow my skills extremely fast this year cuz im going to the hard ones right away
 AntiSquid: wtf is that Astrobytes :p
 Imsure1200q: lol 
 eulerscheZahl: you missed some :popcorn: AntiSquid
 Imsure1200q: bcuz i wanted to test out raycasting
 Astrobytes: Well, the other day he was gonna use a NN for Space Maze, then A* (but didn't know it), then, this morning: Ray-casting
 Imsure1200q: but i found out its extremely time consuming (kinda) and its not worth it
 Imsure1200q: also you forgot: 'i wanted to split a string
 Astrobytes: ^
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Astrobytes: That too. Thank you.
 AntiSquid: you should learn pathfinding, not use NN to do pathfinding for you, takes too long to train that shit
 Imsure1200q: its good that i overcome that problem in no time
 AntiSquid: i am trying to use NN in XR for the PUSH turns only :p
 Imsure1200q: ^ which is why im not looking forward to nn anymore
 AntiSquid: it's more like compiling some stats to find out best push moves for given board state
 CommanderCero: Also neural networks are only good in recognizing patterns, pathfinding is pure brute force. You could use a nn to generate good heuristics but thats it
 Astrobytes: Is it working yet AntiSquid or still outputting 6 3&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: i fixed that bit somehow
 Astrobytes: I thought you fixed it from 6 6 to 6 3 :P
 AntiSquid: now i just need to make it stop swinging like a pendulum the weight values when training and make sure the results are good
 Astrobytes: :D
 Imsure1200q: is the oware thingy a NN challenge?
 Astrobytes: Does your mouse work?
 struct: you can use w/e
 AntiSquid: everything is a whatever works works challenge
 Astrobytes: I solved it using 2 magnets, a potato and some crocodile clips.
 Imsure1200q: +
 cegprakash: I see someone submitted my own code on my puzzle :O
 cegprakash: did they copy paste from my contribution?
 JBM: most likely
 cegprakash: is it allowed :o
 JBM: who knows
 cegprakash: okay
 cegprakash: to avoid ppl copy pasting
 cegprakash: I'll give away a big hint
 cegprakash: of using Bézout's identity
 Imsure1200q: haha

 gobber: so im stumped
 jacek: mhm
 gobber: and its not working lol its so dumb 
 Astrobytes: So you copypasted from github, and it isn't working? :thinking:
 gobber: nope
 gobber: i tryed it my self then git hub 
 Astrobytes: First line:i got // <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CyberLemonade/Codingame/blob/master/Very%20Hard/The%20Last%20Crusade%20-%20Episode%203.java">https://github.com/CyberLemonade/Codingame/blob/master/Very%20Hard/The%20Last%20Crusade%20-%20Episode%203.java</a>
 gobber: page not found
 gobber: lol
 struct: still 
 WINWINWIN: cyberlemonade probably did not give the perfect solution
 WINWINWIN: why would he?
 gobber:&#160;?
 struct: Might need to use google better
 gobber:&#160;? i did
 WINWINWIN: He probably kept his previous versions there while he worked on it
 gobber: oh ok but i went here and it dident work  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/vadim-job-hg/Codingame/blob/master/VERY%20HARD/THE%20LAST%20CRUSADE%20-%20EPISODE%203/java/the-last-crusade-episode-3.java">https://github.com/vadim-job-hg/Codingame/blob/master/VERY%20HARD/THE%20LAST%20CRUSADE%20-%20EPISODE%203/java/the-last-crusade-episode-3.java</a>
 Astrobytes: Don't come here telling us you're a pro coder, then post 4 disjointed sections of code you found on google, and try asking us to help you.
 Astrobytes: Please.
 WINWINWIN: Why dont you start with the easy puzzles?
 struct: So you copy pasting code from a copy pasted code
 struct: Not bad
 WINWINWIN: I have not done last crusade 3 yet, but it if it like any other of the very hards, it is a full day`s work
 Astrobytes: Copypaste Inception
 Xcalibre: WINWINWIN u underestimate it
 WINWINWIN: Underestimate what?&#160;:/
 Xcalibre: last crusade episode 3
 Astrobytes: The difficulty, I believe he means WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: That hard huh&#160;:)
 Xcalibre: yeah Astrobytes
 gobber: fine i was a pro coder 4 years ago i just picked it up  and im back i did atart with easy codes i did start frome easy to this one geze i tryed it my self and diden't work sorry fine ill leve thanks for helping 
 WINWINWIN: gobber there is nothing wrong with copy pasting puzzles
 Astrobytes: ...
 gobber: i know im not mad 
 WINWINWIN: but dont you want to do them on your own?
 gobber: sorry lol 
 WINWINWIN: Next time, asking Automaton2000 for help is good
 Automaton2000: but might be a feature
 gobber:&#160;? who is automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i trying to solve the game
 gobber: oh ok its you
 Xcalibre: which game Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: well that is a new multi
 Imsure1200q: eulre when did you publich space maze
 inoryy: Automaton2000 spill the beans
 Automaton2000: it's not like i would be a problem for me in the first turn
 Quidome: ok, i back, last crusade 3, well didn't  try that one yet and think I am not of much help sorry
 gobber: its ok 
 Astrobytes: o/ inoryy
 gobber:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 30 minutes to tell him that Quidome? nice
 gobber: oh lol
 WINWINWIN: gobber, why dont you try solving The Descent?
 gobber: im trying that now thx 
 Quidome: sorry&#160;:(, something was happening here in my personal space wasn't clear about that
 inoryy: \o Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: are you doing any CG stuff inoryy&#160;?
 gobber: me
 gobber: nvm
 gobber: i finished the desent 
 WINWINWIN: Nicely done, try the first Last Crusade then
 gobber: ok
 WINWINWIN: build up to the 3rd episode
 WINWINWIN: inoryy is working at DeepMind as interesting as it seems?
 gobber: cool lol
 inoryy: WINWINWIN it's quite fun, yeah&#160;:)
 inoryy: AntiSquid thought about doing something on the ooc multi
 TaimoorAbdullahKhan: Is there any plagerism check being done on our submissions?
 TaimoorAbdullahKhan: like someone asked me to solve one of the questions to help them, i have done it, and given them the code, but i'm thinking should if i submit it on my side, will it cause them issues?
 struct: I think they only check on contests
 AntiSquid: yes for contests
 AntiSquid: probably only at the end 
 jrke: when is next contest someone told me in june there is unofficial contest by thibpat
 Man_on_the_Moon: i think the next contest is in the fall
 Uljahn: jrke: check the forum
 Uljahn: or discord
 jrke: ya i checked from 5th june maybe
 Man_on_the_Moon: oh i was wrong
 Man_on_the_Moon: i dont know how to check these thing
 Man_on_the_Moon: s
 jrke: join thibpat server on discord
 Man_on_the_Moon: ok i will

 Astrobytes: Liking the perl submission in TVC JBM
 JBM: :bow:
 jrke: [CG]Thibaud confirmed  contest from this friday
 eulerscheZahl: not a contest. just promoting an existing multiplayer game
 jrke: but its unofficial contest written in discord
 eulerscheZahl: just promoting an existing multiplayer game
 eulerscheZahl: no new content
 AntiSquid: let's hope it's XR 
 Astrobytes: So everyone competing in the same multiplayer game
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN what game would you pick?
 struct: XR?
 AutomatonNN: how do you play a game and then copy the replay so you should control the free to save me and maybe 
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid, let's hope the NN is up to speed then
 jrke: ya euler that i know exsisting mutiplayer
 AntiSquid: wouldn't save you even if you begged AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: that is so not a huge battle and counter it
 Astrobytes: Automaton2000, AutomatonNN is talking rubbish again, fix it
 Automaton2000: why're u still not wood 3&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: what trig the other player is the contest to the next contest?
 Astrobytes: Pfff. 
 Astrobytes: Where is Space Maze Solver? Did he leave already?
 AntiSquid: wonder if a prune array would help AutomatonNN, Automaton2000 build proper sentences
 AutomatonNN: good
 Automaton2000: want to see his code
 Astrobytes: They agree.
 McJackson164: how can i get rid of captchas? damn, i'm not a robot 
 Astrobytes: Are you *completely* sure about that?
 AntiSquid: stop playing clash, only way
 TheMysteriousDidgeridoo_be8a: Algorithms
 Astrobytes: Proofs
 eulerscheZahl: there will be more space maze solving tomorrow
 Astrobytes: I can hardly contain my excitement
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i have a feeling he might not solve it in the end
 struct: Why do you say that euler?
 eulerscheZahl: because i bet he will return tomorrow
 struct: who?
 Astrobytes: I have a similar feeling
 eulerscheZahl: tried to solve space maze with a neural network and ray tracing so far
 struct: nice troll
 eulerscheZahl: something with 1200q, forgot the full nickname
 Astrobytes: And A*. Even though he couldn't do it. And knows no pathfinding.
 Astrobytes: 3 days 'solving' levels
 eulerscheZahl: and he likes math. but not reading formulas
 struct: Next thing you gonna say is that he uses D
 Astrobytes: And couldn't split a string in C++ so 'ported his code' back to JS. Didn't know JS passed anything by reference (copies of references w/e), didn't know what objects, properties and prototypes were (he learned JS 3 years ago you see).Need we go on?&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: The ray casting really made my morning though, I have to say.
 eulerscheZahl: i missed it, just saw you nagging him&#160;:(
 struct: The changes that they made to javascript make it so annoying to clash
 struct: Why would they make all vars const ...
 Astrobytes: They made JS *more* annoying? :P
 eulerscheZahl: complain on the forum struct
 eulerscheZahl: i vaguely remember someone did already
 struct: It's annoying on fastest
 Astrobytes: Fix ur speed struct
 AntiSquid: iamsure1200iq
 Astrobytes: That's the one
 eulerscheZahl: iq? are you sure?
 Astrobytes: -i
 Astrobytes: Nah, it's Imsure1200q
 AntiSquid: hm maybe i forgot his username or he deleted
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/29bfd99bdf5a280ad8b8e3b1a8c735dd6446192">https://www.codingame.com/profile/29bfd99bdf5a280ad8b8e3b1a8c735dd6446192</a>
 Astrobytes: Imsure about this
 eulerscheZahl: but are you sure 1200q?
 Astrobytes: Guess he probably github'd the JS CSB gold bot he has
 AntiSquid: i misread it lol
 Astrobytes: I can never be sure 1200q euler
 Astrobytes: Only he can.
 AntiSquid: what does the q stand for then
 AntiSquid: i kept reading it as IQ
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you told that it's not his real IQ
 eulerscheZahl: which made no sense to me
 AntiSquid: with 1200 IQ he could be doing what he said he is doing and we are a bunch of idiots for laughing at him&#160;:/
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: But, cant blame him for struggling with Space Maze
 eulerscheZahl: i still can't solve part 2 :cry:
 Astrobytes: q = questionable
 struct: Have you tried NN euler?
 Astrobytes: Try ray-casting.
 eulerscheZahl: yeah but without raytracing so far
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: try gaymax
 eulerscheZahl: this time you were faster
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: You need to write down all the moves in other people's replays euler, then pretend you're not gonna hardcode them. Then ask about validators.
 jrke: hey lets vote which multiplayer we want
 Astrobytes: Why?
 jrke: just for fun
 eulerscheZahl: i vote for carcassonne
 eulerscheZahl: that's a hint, wlesavo&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Fishy Adventure
 WINWINWIN: After a cursory read, is this logic fair for space maze? pathfinder only allowing ground tiles and n voids where n is the number of floaters, then move the floaters to accomodate that path?
 AntiSquid: BOTG jrke
 jrke: i vote for CSB a only vote for it maybe
 WINWINWIN: CSB is boring
 AntiSquid: that would be stupid if it's CSB :D
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Please not f'ing CSB
 WINWINWIN: Exactly my reaction :P
 jrke: i said only vote for CSB&#160;;)
 WINWINWIN: If it is physics based then Mean Max would be a lot more fun
 Astrobytes: define 'fun'
 WINWINWIN: new and not as monotonic
 jrke: bit runner will be tough enough
 AntiSquid: jrke i bet any of the games with 3k+ players in them won't be the contest, 100% sure
 Astrobytes: Do you know how long I've been putting off the sim for that?
 AntiSquid: sure1200q
 AntiSquid: actually
 WINWINWIN: what is 1200q?
 AntiSquid: idk
 Astrobytes: BR? That would be interesting.
 WINWINWIN: Already done&#160;:/
 jrke: but tough enough
 Astrobytes: As in losing lots of players really fast.
 jrke: only 4 in wood 1(BT)
 eulerscheZahl: every game is touch when you try hard
 Astrobytes: BT jrke?
 jrke: Bit runner
 AntiSquid: i mean look at thib pat's streams, i think he will pick something newbie friendly
 jrke: sorry typing mist its BR
 WINWINWIN: Tulips and Daisies?
 Astrobytes: oh, BR&#160;:) The bosses are *hard*
 AntiSquid: as in definitely not BR imo
 Astrobytes: ^
 WINWINWIN: How about Yinsh?
 eulerscheZahl: i bet he will choose something that he wants to play himself. and not a community contribution
 AntiSquid: something he will probably have fun streaming, kinda have a feeling he also wants to stream
 Astrobytes: Probably. Do we care?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't
 WINWINWIN: PCR would probably be the best choice then?
 AntiSquid: why euler? he tried twist, maybe he wants to play tower defence
 eulerscheZahl: done most games
 Astrobytes: *dereference
 WINWINWIN: Wouldnt matter to you eulerscheZahl :P legend in all multis
 AntiSquid: too long :p
 Astrobytes: (see what I did there?)
 jrke: ya PCR can be
 eulerscheZahl: legend doesn't mean that i'm done
 eulerscheZahl: just that i lost motivation
 eulerscheZahl: there are bots where i'm happy, e.g. smash the code
 WINWINWIN: Not many people are high ranking in PCR so wouldnt it be the natural choice?
 AntiSquid: you're done when you are 4 points above 2nd in every multi :p
 eulerscheZahl: and others where i just reached legend and called it a day
 jrke: FB?
 AntiSquid: funny bits
 Astrobytes: I think that's why multi of the month was a good idea, to pique your interest again with some active participation
 eulerscheZahl: "Not many people are high ranking in PCR "
 eulerscheZahl: there are always 10 players in top10...
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) I meant that over 1K are in the bottommost league
 jrke: i think they won't choose latest bot programming
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine with a multiplayer game of the month. i just refuse to call it a "contest"
 Astrobytes: It better not be UTG/CR or Code Royale
 AntiSquid: not many are high rank = legend isn't flooded :p
 struct: Who the hell is accepting these clashes
 Astrobytes: Yes eulerscheZahl
 WINWINWIN: That makes sense, contest should probably be reserved for new Multis to give it seriousness
 struct: a = 'JFMAMJJASOND'*50m = input()print(a[a.find(m) + len(m)])
 struct: This shit was reverse
 Astrobytes: yeah WINWINWIN, I think thibpat has got that idea now from us all suggesting it&#160;:)
 jrke: PCR is looking good as participants&lt;3000 and held in 2014 so its looks good
 eulerscheZahl: january, february, march, ...
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz struct
 WINWINWIN: :D
 jrke: just imagine if descent&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Not a multi
 jrke: :smile:
 AntiSquid: there's a huge influx of new players doing clash and clash puzzles all the time so ... @structalso you don't need level you need clashes played for clash moderation
 Astrobytes: struct - that was seriously a reverse clash?
 struct: yes
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: I mean I know they said "no clash is too easy" but for crying out loud, that's atrocious
 AntiSquid: you need 1200iq
 struct: euler got it preety fast though
 struct: I think he is accepting the clashes invites
 WINWINWIN: Exactly AntiSquid, Astrobytes there are some easier clashes out there
 Astrobytes: I got it as soon as I looked at it. It's RIDICULOUSLY easy
 Astrobytes: To the point of pointlessness
 AntiSquid: he has some magical search app struct
 WINWINWIN: There was one where you have to do a titling of all the words of a string
 Astrobytes: Not really needed there AntiSquid!
 WINWINWIN: in python that is literally print(s.title())
 Astrobytes: What capitalise all the words?
 AntiSquid: a = 'JFMAMJJASOND'*50
 jrke: what  about OOC
 jrke: maybe can't
 WINWINWIN: OOC people just spent a month on
 AntiSquid: ah ok .
 jrke: PCR is getting highest probality 
 AntiSquid: but it looks random -,.....,-
 eulerscheZahl: struct i sometimes read pending contributions and shake my head about the nonsense there
 eulerscheZahl: and i have a good memory sometimes
 struct: I dont even know what went through my head to try clashes again
 AntiSquid: good way to fill your mind with useless shit
 Astrobytes: Yes, same euler, some of the utter tripe in there is beyond belief
 AntiSquid: wait tripe is bad?
 WINWINWIN: Take this one for example,
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/504797d0e9f426b7f9deca3c341801a99cb3">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/504797d0e9f426b7f9deca3c341801a99cb3</a>
 Astrobytes: jrke, I bet you 95.05 (virtual) rupees that it's not gonna be PCR
 AntiSquid: you have haggis as national favorite
 WINWINWIN: Reasonably tough puzzle... But the "took me 3 mins to write the code" was ridiculous
 jrke: i m not betting cz i don't want to win money&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: ah nvm ignore me
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, I used to eat a lot of tripe when I wasn't veggie actually.  Mostly CEntral-Eastern european soups and stews
 jrke: hey going to sleep bye everyone
 jrke: astrobytes no bet&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol gn jrke
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: i forgot there's no tripe in haggis ... also forgot about the cow tripe with cream soup
 eulerscheZahl: i bet it will be hypersonic
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, haggis is great
 WINWINWIN: Who is python programer?
 AntiSquid: what made you turn vegetarian&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Some of his comments on contributions are ridiculous
 AntiSquid: i use python&#160;?
 Alshock: @WINWINWIN I prented to be, but I don't know what I'm doing
 eulerscheZahl: i puked and saw the remains. made me think about what i'm eating
 AntiSquid: does that make me a python programmer?
 WINWINWIN: I meant the id
 eulerscheZahl: and that the poor animal died for nothing
 WINWINWIN: python_programer
 Alshock: @eulerscheZahl not sure if dying for something is actually a thing.
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid was cooking a lot of veg stuff for my mother as she was having some allergy issues, plus I have a lot of vegan friends and am an animal lover and environmental conservationist. Made sense tbh
 eulerscheZahl: i mean i started questioning my behaviour. i can live without anyone having to die.
 eulerscheZahl: that was &gt; 20 years ago
 Astrobytes: Absolutely.
 AntiSquid: idk ... my best selling dishes were vegan mostly, didn't turn me into a vegan vegetarian :p
 Alshock: well, without anyone having to die seems a bit optimistic, but it makes sense to try and reduce that number
 AntiSquid: by best selling i mean they sold out too fucking quickly
 eulerscheZahl: because you had to less of them?
 AntiSquid: no
 WINWINWIN: These kinds of comments should not be allowed on contributions
 WINWINWIN: python_programerPP16 days agostfu m8, 
 AntiSquid: they looked pretty, veg dishes can be colorful
 eulerscheZahl: so vegans (and others) actually buy your dishes, not just demand you to offer them.that distinguishes them from D coders
 AntiSquid: i think it's law to offer some vegan or veg items on the menu, 1 or 2 ...
 Astrobytes: Most food I cook is vegan by default, not deliberate. I just can't resist cheese. Although the horrors of the dairy industry are clear to me. 
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN "python_programerPP16 " is IAmNoob
 Astrobytes: "that distinguishes them from D coders" :D
 AntiSquid: so much hate for D :p
 Astrobytes: I'm not hating on the language, just those zealots
 Astrobytes: Not my cup of tea but sure it has it's uses like most langs.
 Astrobytes: And it's a good CG meme now so... :P
 AntiSquid: it's a fast scripting language, maybe that's why it's backed by zealots
 eulerscheZahl: it's compiled
 AntiSquid: i don't really get the meme though, don't find it funny 
 Astrobytes: I can deal with Zealots but if they bring Carriers we're fked
 AntiSquid: well script like syntax 
 Astrobytes: *Some script-like syntax
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by " if they bring Carriers we're fked"
 Astrobytes: Weird combo for me, but whatever
 Astrobytes: Never played StarCraft AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: i did
 Astrobytes: Protoss
 struct: I played like 10 minutes and got bored
 AntiSquid: mm
 struct: not my type of game
 Astrobytes: Zealots, carriers, probes, templar etc
 Alshock: In 6 pools we trust
 Alshock: Yeah I never played starcraft, and I just know some random memes
 AntiSquid: need additional button mashing skills
 AntiSquid: maybe we should have a D only contest&#160;? :p
 AntiSquid: D Heroes
 Astrobytes: I didn't get into multi SC2, just SC then BW
 Astrobytes: D'Heroes
 AntiSquid: played sc2 for story
 Alshock: BW&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Me too AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: was disappointed / annoyed at the end
 Astrobytes: Brood War Alshock
 Alshock: Thanks and sorry xD
 Astrobytes: Sorry for...?
 AntiSquid: stopped playing blizz games, D3 story disappointed too (just personal opinion)
 Astrobytes: Diablo 2 was best, but I still like grinding D3 single player or with a mate or 2
 Astrobytes: Can't beat the atmosphere of original Diablo tho', the music, the darkness, 'twas awesome at the time
 AntiSquid: do we need a D2 clone on CG&#160;? fastest speedrun wins&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol, I think not
 Astrobytes: That's a RAIC candidate no?
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: i liked the 2D shooter, except for the random aim
 AntiSquid: the rules were annoyingly complicated, but i could have still enjoyed the game
 Astrobytes: I didn't see it until it was too late, looked alright til I heard about it :D
 AntiSquid: if you move while shooting aim becomes even more random
 Astrobytes: Wouldn't be RAIC if the rules weren't annoyingly complicated tho
 AntiSquid: but why random aim
 Astrobytes: Movement anxiety? :P
 AntiSquid: even if you stand still
 Astrobytes: Your AI automatically has some kind of PTSD?
 AntiSquid: hands shaking
 eulerscheZahl: the suicide mines annoyed me much more than the random aim
 Astrobytes: Also, what was with the ladders, when you could jump up to a platform anyway? Or was that just one replay I saw
 AntiSquid: some times they were useful to climb
 AntiSquid: in final part of the contest they def were
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 eulerscheZahl: you could stand in the air on ladders
 Astrobytes: As in just be halfway up a ladder or actually in mid-air?
 eulerscheZahl: stand anywhere on the ladder
 AntiSquid: the random aim meant that beginner bots could still wreck you just by running towards you and shooting, no pathing needed
 AntiSquid: default bot even
 eulerscheZahl: just jumping without ladder =&gt; you fall down again, easy target
 AntiSquid: i still remember late in contest, top 10 players were losing vs some default bots :p
 eulerscheZahl: so ladders were a plus at dodging
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I see the importance of ladders now, didn't know you could stay on them
 WINWINWIN: When exacly do they update codinpoints?
 Astrobytes: 1am French time?
 eulerscheZahl: once per day. in about 6h i think
 eulerscheZahl: i'm always sleeping when it happens
 AntiSquid: 1 am UK time actually
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 WINWINWIN: 4 hrs?
 AntiSquid: quarter past midnight french time
 AntiSquid: afaik
 Astrobytes: Eh?
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that 2am french?
 AntiSquid: i checked leaderboard few times after french midnight
 Astrobytes: They're 1 hour ahead of us squiddy
 AntiSquid: and it's not updated
 AntiSquid: it's always at 1:15 am or so
 AntiSquid: UK time
 eulerscheZahl: so 2:15 french time
 AntiSquid: ah nvm it is 2am france
 AntiSquid: ya ok my bad 
 eulerscheZahl: CEST
 eulerscheZahl: right now it's 5 past bed time
 eulerscheZahl: see you
 AntiSquid: bye
 Astrobytes: CEST? C'est vrai!
 Astrobytes: gn
 eulerscheZahl: contral eurpoean summer time :rolling_eyes:
 Astrobytes: *central
 Astrobytes: I just said "it's true"
 Astrobytes: Bad pun?
 Hvosten: Hi Guys,Do you use maybe file merger for Java? I tried various option and nothing works for me&#160;:/ 
 AntiSquid: 7 am to 7 am why does the contest start at 8 in the morning? :D
 Astrobytes: Hvosten I thiiiink if you search on the forum, there's one or two file mergers for Java
 Astrobytes: At least one anyway
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid thibpat streams clashes at 8am ffs, man's a beast
 Hvosten: I tried them I cannot force them to work :D
 Astrobytes: Post a request for help in the forum thread? Or ask here, maybe someone can help you get them working (not me, Java gives me a headache)
 AntiSquid: @Astrobytes snaps fingers and plays same playlist
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: JBM, if you're around, the TVC viewer goes blank after a couple of games. Consistently. In Chrome. Other games not doing the same.
 Astrobytes: Seems to be fine in Opera and FF
 Astrobytes: struct, what's happening with Shabu/Shobu/Shamu/Shangis/whateverit'scalled?
 jacek: shtruct
 Astrobytes: Hey jacek, you should make Yahtzee
 JBM: interesting, lemme try
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: not here&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Any luck reproducing JBM? In true bug-form, it hasn't happened since I reported it. Yet it's been happening all day (on 2 different PCs) with multiple restarts.
 Astrobytes: Ah.
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: i only started pushing stuff at around 6 CEST
 JBM: and then again, did not touch the viewer today
 Astrobytes: One Win 8.1 and one Win 10
 JBM: i only have a win10
 JBM: chrome, errr 83.0.4103.61
 JBM: ... .97 now
 Astrobytes: I'm on latest w/ever that is
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I also had a few black screens (Firefox)
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 Astrobytes: Recent?
 JBM: nope, still get my ui
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 JBM: i only get a temporary black sometimes as part of the demo
 Astrobytes: No, this is full-on blackout
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it was full black here
 JBM: the rest of the ui still working?
 JBM: what does the console report?
 Astrobytes: Didn't check console, if it happens again I'll let you know
 JBM: yes please
 UnnamedCodinGamer: everything else seemed normal
 Astrobytes: What were your UI settings UnnamedCodinGamer?
 Astrobytes: Verbose trolling etc
 UnnamedCodinGamer: like theme?
 Astrobytes: No the settings for the viewer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: on/off/GREen
 JBM: you have to give the actual options
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think this is the default
 JBM: the ordering is random
 JBM: the defaults, OTOH, aren't (too much)
 JBM: like, pants color definitely is random
 UnnamedCodinGamer: verbose trolling on
 UnnamedCodinGamer: detroll mode off
 JBM: but a bad pants color would likely merely result in a naked troll, not a crash or allblack ui
 JBM: yes, those are the defaults
 JBM: well, no matter if it currently doesn't reproduce
 JBM: and if it does
 JBM: please look at the JS console
 Astrobytes: Then I've had it with detroll mode on and off
 Astrobytes: Will certainly do
 JBM: is that in the main viewer only or in last battles?
 Astrobytes: Main viewer only
 UnnamedCodinGamer: i had both
 JBM: because it doesn't in B, or because you never tried?
 JBM: ah ok
 JBM: thx
 UnnamedCodinGamer: after reload of last battles it was back to normal
 JBM: mmm
 Astrobytes: Could be a resource usage thing over x amount of time
 Astrobytes: Donno
 JBM: if it's irreproducible after reload, i'm tempted to dismiss as "something something cache"
 JBM: resource usage i'm more doubtful
 JBM: but who knows
 Astrobytes: Was still getting it after clearing cache earlier
 JBM: dear me
 JBM: ok, creating an actual entry in the PLAB
 Astrobytes: Anyway, don't worry about it too much until we can give you some more details
 JBM: right
 JBM: eagerly awaiting those
 Astrobytes: Anybody doing any kind of search in this or is it just True AI and random()?
 JBM: entry created
 Astrobytes: Cool
 JBM: :zipper_mouth:
 JBM: totally true ai
 JBM: more true than a scotsman
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what is True AI?
 Astrobytes: I've got a alphabeta which worked surprisingly well
 Astrobytes: Just a CG meme since last contest UnnamedCodinGamer - If-else
 UnnamedCodinGamer: aha
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have monte carlo search plus a couple of if - else
 JBM: just some guy trying to justify he should be ranked better than the opponents he lost to
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I was gonna try some kind of MCTS but I messed it up, might try again
 JBM: i know it sounds stupid when you spell it out like this
 JBM: but that's what i read into it
 Astrobytes: It's on point JBM
 Astrobytes: Your search worked well UnnamedCodinGamer&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: if you are referring to my current position - half of the bots are broken
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's annoying af
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but yes, I was 9th before that
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, you can not test much now
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 pb4: Who's working on TvC at the moment&#160;?
 JBM: only me it seems
 Astrobytes: Us.
 JBM: patches welcome!
 JBM: please send help
 Astrobytes: Oh well, not working on the source :P
 pb4: sending thoughts and prayers 
 Astrobytes: :pray:
 JBM: i suppose that's (unprovably) better than nothing
 pb4: Thanks for pushing me up Astrobytes :D
 JBM: so thanks for the intent
 Astrobytes: lol pb4
 Astrobytes: JBM I can piss in the wind if you like, I hear it's just as effective&#160;:+1:
 JBM: you write up bug reports
 JBM: that's a great help
 Astrobytes: pb4 as UnnamedCodinGamer pointed out, too many broken bots in lb right now
 JBM: oh, and text content too
 Astrobytes: Yeah, OK, I guess&#160;:)
 JBM: oh dear i'm mixing up the true AI guy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/58?u=jbm">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/58?u=jbm</a> and the please upgrade my rank one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/39?u=jbm">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/39?u=jbm</a>
 JBM: how unfair to... either of them i guess
 JBM: UnnamedCodinGamer: but you've got the spring challenge summary there in a nutshell
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah. I still think there's a bit of overlap there though.
 JBM: still craking up at this one
 JBM: "the system favors bots ranked 50-60"
 JBM: now why didn't *I* think of just writing a rank 50-60 bot?
 JBM: that would have favored me, who knows, i might even have won
 JBM: oh sorry it's 40-50 in the original
 JBM: not sure my point still stands
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: Must bear this in mind for next contest.
 JBM: yeah, heed the wisdom in *that*
 Astrobytes: Truly words to live by.
 struct: Is oware simple?
 JBM: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes. But complex.
 JBM: 5 letters
 Astrobytes: In it's own way.
 JBM: hard to trim
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Don't tell me you're doing an alphazero too struct
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: OK. Then what...
 struct: mcts?
 Astrobytes: Has to be EPT
 Astrobytes: Can also alphabeta
 struct: ept?
 Astrobytes: Early playout termination
 Astrobytes: AFAIK we all use depth 0
 Astrobytes: So, instead of rollout, eval
 Astrobytes: Getting your eval right is the hard bit
 Astrobytes: I used alphabeta up to a point then tried to MCTS, then plugged in the eval and went from there
 Astrobytes: There's too much happening for a straight MCTS to work
 struct: hmm
 jacek: do propagate eval or just squash it into win/lose
 struct: I might just port shobu then
 Astrobytes: You can do either jacek, but because of the strategic aspect it's hard to just win or lose
 Astrobytes: You can cap your eval to certain values though
 Astrobytes: Take one position and it looks like you're dead in the water, one move later you've won
 jacek: like uttt
 Astrobytes: Eval is more important here
 Astrobytes: I mean I haven't done UTTT but I'm sickeningly familiar with it
 jacek: no good eval for uttt exists
 Astrobytes: Exactly
 Astrobytes: Eval for Oware does
 jacek: but mcts shows 65+% win, then move later, loss
 Astrobytes: Yes, because each step needs eval
 Astrobytes: Seems a bit weird at first to use MCTS in this way but it works
 jacek: well for breakthrough smart people used 4 random moves before using eval in ept
 Astrobytes: You won't get away with that in Oware. Random starting moves will not benefit you
 Astrobytes: *a series of random moves
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I need to go have a snack then sleep, ping me tomorrow jacek 
 jacek: what for&#160;:?
 Astrobytes: Any questions or discussions
 Astrobytes: Or random trolls :P
 Astrobytes: Anyway, gn/bn/dobranoc
 JBM: gn
 koduncu: why dont you share yours codes
 JBM: why should we?
 JBM: do you share yours?
 koduncu: yes
 JBM: ok
 JBM: then we should
 koduncu: i want to learn how you solved problems
 LelouchVC2: It's not something you learn
 LelouchVC2: It's a gift from God
 ZarthaxX: LMAO
 struct: ZarthaxX
 JLace: wait, what am I supposed to be doing?
 JLace: lol
 JLace: first time, rip me
 ZarthaxX: hey struct
 JAJAJAJAJoe: I'm kind of having trouble understanding the `Telephone Numbers` challenge, what exactly is it asking to be transformed?
 LelouchVC2: Which one is that
 LelouchVC2: CoC or puzzle?
 JAJAJAJAJoe: just puzzle, under practice. Medium I think
 LelouchVC2: The one where you use a trie tree?
 JAJAJAJAJoe: I guess it makes sense if the 5 numbers depicted need to be stored. Yeah, that's it
 JAJAJAJAJoe: OOooooooh I think I see what it's asking. disregard, and thank you!
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: ...I am very confused. So I'm doing the Temperatures puzzle, and, as far as I can tell the autogenerated code doesn't actually parse all the entries?
 Snef: it does but you have to store them
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: Right, I've got a for-loop storing them into a table, but. There are five expected entries, and the table is only taking four of them, the first one seems to be getting dropped.
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: I'm probably overthinking this, but
 Snef: the  default code is not bugged
 Snef: which langage do you use
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: Lua
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: Oh, I see what I'm doing wrong
 Snef: i tried it and it works
 Snef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c94b4bc3-d950-4b0e-bacd-9cee2596f064">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c94b4bc3-d950-4b0e-bacd-9cee2596f064</a>
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: The default loop starts at i=o, and I'm using that value to initialize my table, so it's trying to put the first value in temp[0]
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: Which I'm pretty sure is no bueno
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: There we go, now it's actually grabbing the whole thing. Sorry to be a pest
 TheAwardWinningStopwatch_865b: i=0 not i=o, fatfingers
 code_maniac: What's wrong with chat server&#160;?it keep on crashing&#160;:/ 
 Imsure1200q: maybe restart your browser and do codingame first thing
 Imsure1200q: *computer not browser
 code_maniac: Thanks man, but still no luck
 Imsure1200q: i think some users also experience the problem sometimes
 Imsure1200q: either your computer overloaded, or the network is slow, or maybe the codingame server is being overloaded
 code_maniac: Internet and computer doesn't seems to be issue, as i am able to access other website properly without any issue

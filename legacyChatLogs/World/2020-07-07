 SarthakSingh: python is the easiest language in the world
 Sandy9808: But python will not help you in coding interviews   HA HA
 LelouchVC2: Neither will cancer
 quocdai-IT: đông lào
 quocdai-IT: say hello
 SarthakSingh: who says it'll not help
 SarthakSingh: m
 LelouchVC2: The dead people
 Ashraful: Which fool says python will not help. Programming language simply doesn't matter
 Ashraful: Stop fighting for programming language and don't be chauvinistic
 Ashraful: Sandy has not a good ranking
 Ashraful: Python is easy but (not only for child language)
 tomatoes: :smiley:
 JuliaPham: hello guy
 JuliaPham: i'm a girlfriend =))
 LelouchVC2: said no girl ever
 JuliaPham: sory, it not enough
 JuliaPham: i'm finding a girlfriend
 BravenJuliet: that is my friend Lelouch :D
 JuliaPham: Hello bro, how r u&#160;?
 BravenJuliet: i am fine thank you, and you&#160;:)
 JuliaPham:  not good =)), i'm trying some question in coding game, so difficult, ringht =))
 khailq: you two are so gei
 LeBaoHoang8A4: YOU are so good!
 lovingkiller: hi
 JuliaPham: @khailq, enjoy some game&#160;?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Which grade are you, JuliaPham?
 JuliaPham: i'm 22 years old bro
 khailq: Hi i'm 11. Nice to meet you
 JuliaPham: badboy @Khailq

 DomiKo: how often rank is refreshed?
 [CG]Thibaud: every night
 DomiKo: thx
 DinuBrat: #RO
 Schwase: i usually avoid using forums on practice challenges until i finish it myself, should i be avoiding the forums if i want to solve them independently or are they typically more constructive rather than straight solutions/walkthroughs? 
 Uljahn: solutions are locked until you solve the puzzle at 100%, there could be some hints on the forums though
 Schwase: ok, mainly i was dealing with a low number of validators and a 50% on submission but turns out i just can't read and somehow still passed the test cases. appreciate the feedback
 Uljahn: some puzzles have "discussions" tab on the landing page, others have dedicated forum threads
 Schwase: gotcha
 Uljahn: no plain solutions are allowed
 Y0ursTruly: but what up with this reversemode
 Hjax: are multi and contests cp formula different? besides decay on contests 
 Hjax: oh wait i cant read, nevermind
 Magus: yes they are different:D
 Uljahn: btw Magus what's happened to Automaton2000 on ru? it doesn't respond&#160;:(
 Automaton2000: maybe i just need to fix my csb
 DomiKo: finally reached my first legend :D
 DomiKo: GrandMaster is comming today&#160;:)
 dbdr: gg DomiKo! where?
 WINWINWIN: Looks like CSB from his profile...
 WINWINWIN: Nicely done&#160;:)
 Hjax: i found a bug in my othello scoring function, fixed it, seems worse lol 
 WINWINWIN: :D
 reCurse: #justaithings
 Astrobytes: lol
 Magus: Uljahn: it seems like i can't talk on ru myself oO
 Magus: does the ru channel works at all&#160;?
 Hjax: the bug basically meant i was only doing mobility
 Hjax: which is apparently better than anything else i could come up with 
 Uljahn: Magus: that's a bug with ru chat where you have to manually refresh the page&#160;:/
 Uljahn: it was reported on discord some time ago
 Magus: i'm using pidgin i can't refresh anything :D
 Magus: well, i can leave and rejoin
 savan: what is fastest way to learn programming
 Magus: hmmm .... Uljahn: i assume that if you have to leave/join the channel to see new messages, Automaton2000 has the same bug. He can't see any new message until he leave/join. But he can't do that.
 Automaton2000: maybe it's just a way to fix it
 DomiKo: Tron at the moment :D
 DomiKo: iam trying to push my MCTS in UltimateTTT but it's not easy
 WINWINWIN: Found that the best way to learn for UTTT is to wait for MSmits to log in and discuss with other guys like Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Well, I don't have a UTTT bot but for that kind of thing yeah :D
 DomiKo: yea help in UTTT would be the best way
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) Havent gotten a clear understanding on MCTS yet.. But the minimax was heavily based on the chats&#160;:)
 Hjax: i wrote a mcts for the first time not too long ago 
 Hjax: if you have any questions let me know WINWINWIN
 DomiKo: i guess i know basic of MCTS
 DomiKo: i know how it should work
 DomiKo: but the hard part is
 DomiKo: how to implement it correctly
 DomiKo: and how to improve from full random
 DomiKo: i reach 157 place in Gold, with like 20-30K rollouts
 DomiKo: read whole forum
 DomiKo: helped
 DomiKo: but not enough to reach legend
 Astrobytes: Hm, afaik 20k + should be enough  for UTTT?
 Uljahn: i guess you have a bug or not optimal exploration constant
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: maybe
 Hjax: im really confused why my proper eval is worse than just straight mobility 
 Uljahn: 20k on the second turn?
 Astrobytes: And full random is OK for UTTT so you don't need to worry with any heuristics
 reCurse: There's so many reasons it's hard to tell
 Hjax: i wonder how long it would take me to get a UTTT submit from my othello one
 Hjax: i think i still have a UTTT bitboard somewhere, so it might not take very long 
 dbdr: Hjax: try a minus sign in front of the non-mobility eval&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: ^ could well be that
 DomiKo: yea 20K+ on second turn
 Hjax: i definitely checked the signs 
 DomiKo: i will try to play with exploration contant
 dbdr: don't check, just inverse it and try that :D
 Hjax: if its better im going to be upset 
 dbdr: and happy, no?
 Hjax: no, because i wont understand why its better 
 Hjax: ok its even worse with flipped sign lol 
 dbdr: did you spend time calculating the part you didn't use?
 dbdr: otherwise it could be the benefit is perf
 Hjax: i was calculating it, it was just wrong 
 Hjax: i was rewarding corners and penalizing the squares around corners 
 Hjax: but i was looking at the black bitboard for both players 
 Hjax: so it canceled out 
 dbdr: ah :D
 dbdr: maybe your weights are too high
 dbdr: for that part
 Hjax: thats possible, i havent tuned anything 
 dbdr: tune this by dichotomy
 dbdr: if the "ideal" value is closer to zero than to what you have, it would make sense
 Hjax: is your eval function written by hand dbdr? or did you do some fancy training / tuning thing 
 Hjax: i should just stop being lazy and go write n-tuples or something 
 eulerscheZahl: my tshirt got shipped from Russia to Germany and back to Russia&#160;:'(<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tdhlv1">https://prnt.sc/tdhlv1</a>
 reCurse: They don't hold your package in germany?
 Astrobytes: wtf
 Hjax: did they try to deliver it, fail and give up?
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what's going on
 Hjax: return to send 
 Hjax: sender*
 Astrobytes: Do you have the tracking number to contact them with?
 eulerscheZahl: my mailbox is large enough to put in a tshirt without even ringing the doorbell, so that should not be the issue
 eulerscheZahl: and i got that list via tracking number
 Astrobytes: I can only suggest you contact them directly, it could be an error
 Astrobytes: I've had that happen before, tracking says it's gone AWOL and turns out to be a the local depot
 Astrobytes: *at the
 HuyCuto: hello
 jacek: did i miss some uttt talk?
 reCurse: No
 jacek: oh
 Hjax: jacek how many tuples is your eval function? did you generate them randomly or by hand?
 jacek: 4x1 non overlapping horizontal tuples
 jacek: then rotate board by 90 degress and use the same n tuples
 jacek: i used 16 such n-tuples, but 4 could be enough but i was too lazy to make symmetries and whatnot
 jacek: now i have different n-tuples. i created by hand
 jacek: i experimented. i found nx1 are better than squares
 jacek: though i could play more around the corners
 Hjax: thats kind of surprising 
 Hjax: and you just trained using TD learning with selfplay?
 Astrobytes: Kinda the opposite of what I would've thought.
 jacek: yes
 Hjax: did you bootstrap it with a games database from the internet? or just started from scratch 
 jacek: from scratch
 Hjax: neat
 Hjax: thanks for sharing :D 
 jacek: and well, not only pure TD. after TD 'saturated'
 TrapRNotGay: if only I could code away my depression, OH WAIT!
 jacek: i let it play with itself, then i used 2-ply search for self supervised learning so my 0-ply value function would match better the 2-ply
 jacek: several 100k of TD games, and about 50k of self-supervised thing
 jacek: now i have 26k weights in my eval
 Hjax: 26k O_O
 Hjax: i wonder what dbdr is doing then lol
 Hjax: if even that isnt enough to beat him 
 dbdr: let me count&#160;:)
 DomiKo: you talk about OTHELLO?
 Hjax: yes
 dbdr: 300K
 Hjax: you guys are insane 
 Hjax: are you doing n-tuples dbdr? 
 dbdr: thanks :D
 tomatoes: :sweat_smile:
 AndreiSchuch: I've found a solution for "Power of Thor - Episode 1" that uses only 2 if statements, but the character is not fast enough to reach his destination during "Easy angle" and "Optimal angle" test cases.I think there is a bug. :thinking:
 Hjax: tomatoes and me are here with our cute little hand crafted evals 
 Hjax: at least i think tomatoe s is still using a hand crafted eval
 dbdr: gg on #3 by the way, tomatoes
 dbdr: 2 Rust in top 3&#160;:)
 dbdr: the decline of C++ has started&#160;;)
 Hjax: i want to join in, but i dont think im close 
 Hjax: i need to get a real eval 
 DomiKo: this game is like reversi?
 tomatoes: i have fixed weight for corners and frontiers. and increasing closer to the end for moves 
 dbdr: 3 rust in top 10 is pretty good too
 Hjax: how do you have 300k weights in the character limit 
 dbdr: they compress well
 Hjax: i see
 tomatoes: and it total fail for minimax, but good enough for evaled mcts
 jacek: othello is (almost) reversi, yes
 heavygabriel: can we talk about the ANEO thing and how many stuff you gotta take in account?
 jacek: aneo?
 OnlyLouis: whats aneo?
 ZarthaxX: a puzzle
 Astrobytes: BearthaxX o/
 ZarthaxX: Astrothello&#160;:*
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo:  A/Bytes
 ZarthaxX: how is your spine Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: No change ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: wlecato o/
 Hjax: what would my name be? hcat? 
 Astrobytes: Or Catjax
 wlesavo: Hmax
 Astrobytes: Jhax
 Astrobytes: etc
 struct: Hothello
 Astrobytes: Othellax
 Hjax: oooo new robo submit 
 struct: yeah
 Hjax: above the fox now 
 struct: rank 5 it seems
 Astrobytes: Not too far above the fox tho
 Astrobytes: tomatoes has a nice rank now
 Astrobytes: (just noticed)
 wlesavo: damn thats some dbd'recting
 Hjax: he renounced losing games a while ago 
 Hjax: he had a perfect submit, only wins 
 struct: He had 2 I think
 struct: He is at another level
 jacek: robo wins against me
 struct: yeah on last match
 RoboStac: we both win if we're p1, lose as p2
 jacek: matches are the same eh?
 jacek: i have very granual eval
 jacek: and my mcts doesnt have mc in it ;v
 RoboStac: yeah, no randomness for me either and as it's a guided search it tends to be very deterministic
 LintuStorm: =)
 jacek: :horse:

 quoctv: oh 
 quoctv: i don't understand 1's in this problem
 jacek: hm?
 LelouchV: l
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :fast_forward:
 Hjax: i saw i had a win against jacek and i got excited, and then i realized it was just a timeout 
 Astrobytes: yeah that's par for the course in Othello atm&#160;:)
 struct: We need 1 more league&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Fox as boss?
 struct: I guess
 Astrobytes: Hard to pick one right now since robo is on the improvement
 Hjax: why another league 
 Hjax: why any leagues at all 
 struct: I wonder if NN will work
 Astrobytes: To hurt us more Hjax
 struct: The wood 2 league is needed
 Astrobytes: It will struct
 Hjax: its not like it affects anything
 Hjax: why is wood 2 needed 
 struct: Well it will make you play vs stronger players
 Hjax: so?
 Astrobytes: Hurt. A world of hurt.
 Hjax: after a few games your rating is high enough to play strong people even with no leagues 
 struct: Well games in comunity multies are not many
 struct: 80 games per submit
 struct: Is not that much
 Hjax: that seems like quite a few to me 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ra46SPU.png">https://i.imgur.com/ra46SPU.png</a>
 struct: Yeah, its very low
 Hjax: why is 80 low? as long as your rank is stable by the end it doesnt matter
 jacek: and new league would make it lower
 struct: I think in these games its no problem
 struct: There are no random elements
 jacek: just wait till it becomes puzzle of the week
 Hjax: othello doesnt need leagues at all imo 
 Hjax: will it get many submissions if its puzzle of the week 
 jacek: eeyup
 struct: it wil get +1 player
 Astrobytes: Actually, I'm a fan of 2 leagues minimum in community ,ultis
 Astrobytes: *multis
 Astrobytes: So you can play against serious players
 Hjax: i dont hate two leagues, but i dont see the benefit of more 
 Astrobytes: And separate the 'output last/first provided move" bots
 RoboStac: I don't think more are needed unless it gets really popular
 Hjax: which isnt likely lol 
 Hjax: community multis seem to stay tiny forever
 jacek: no more loeagues, unless somehow they will allow for bronze and more
 Astrobytes: I'm surprised more people don't go for the board game ones at least
 Astrobytes: Lack of advertising I guess
 Hjax: yeah community multis are at the bottom of the list, with few players and basically no codinpoints 
 Hjax: why would anyone play one 
 Astrobytes: Teh fun!
 struct: 10*playerCount
 Hjax: the only reason im playing othello is because you guys wouldnt stop talking about it 
 jacek: not (much) exp from them
 struct: 1000 points on Yavalath
 struct: Rank 1 is easy /s
 Hjax: i was going to play ghost in the cell 
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, your legend in 1 submit&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Or delete account ofc
 Hjax: yeah well now im working on othello instead :P
 Leosalty: is bitwolf even real?
 struct: no
 struct: If you click on their profile it will say its a bot
 Leosalty: ah

 Astrobytes: Explanations there
 Leosalty: thank wasnt too confused, I just had an gut feeling and was right
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Alright guys, catch you all tomorrow, take care
 Hjax: cya

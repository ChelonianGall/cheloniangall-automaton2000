 Avxgr: You need to shift the letters depending on the integer shift, which means, if you have the letter H or h which has the position 7 in the english alphabet, and then you have a shift of 2, you will subtract the shift to the position of the H or h = 7 - 2 = 5 and you will replace the H with the letter at position 5 
 Avxgr: And so on
 Avxgr: But you gotta account that if tyou have a key greater than the position of a letter, you need to wrap around the alphabet
 Avxgr: For example, A and shift 2 -&gt; 1(A) - 2 = -1, so no letter at position -1 exists, in this case, you will start from the end of the alphabet, which will give us the letter Y
 Avxgr: LOL
 shuo502: I know

 Ard1998: i have to writy dirty if i want to get that 3 min challange :joy:
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: in what Ard1998
 Ard1998: fast and furious
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: ohh nice
 Ard1998: its like i spend way to much tine naming my vars
 Ard1998: because ny nose itches of to many one lettr names
 Saad-py: bruh what is n+n // 2
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: it is a math probem
 Saad-py: I know
 Saad-py: I was telling that how simple that quetion that was in reverse mode
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: ohh okk
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: its fine
 Ard1998: oof, no shrug emoticon
 Saad-py: if n = 2, 2+2 = 4,  4 // 2 = 2Answer is 2
 Saad-py: lol
 Saad-py: üòéüòé
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: i think it is not easy for beginners 
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: so this equation is given
 Saad-py: lmao I know I am a beginner but i always get hard problems this one was really easy for a 12 y/o  like me
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: i think start coding at 12 years old nice

 JLukeSkywalker: how many characters can we have in our code?
 BrandonTroy: @saad-py, when you said the solution to n+n//2, n=2 is 2 you're wrong. The operation n//2 happens first, so the answer is actually 2 + 1 which is 3. The answer is always n + 1/2 of n. lol

 Spacialman: I got question for anyone who can help me. I am  high school senior who just got accepted into full sail university. I am wanting to get better at coding so I am a little ahead of my class. Is there anyone who can help me?
 Spacialman: The only experience I have is CodeCombat from when I was in basic coding class in my freshman year.
 jacek: do some puzzles here then
 Spacialman: Okay, thank you jacek
 jacek: practice. if you know some basics, you can do it
 jacek: this is not site for complete newbie who cant code at all
 Spacialman: I know the basic code for javascript. That's about all.
 Passifi: build apps games are always hot, do some puzzles here, there are a couple of theoretical things I found really helpful basic pc architecture and knowing binary arithmetic doing the from nand to tetris course made it click for me then rinse and repeat and be prepared to be frustrated&#160;:)
 jacek: thats good enough
 Spacialman: Thank you Passifi and jacek.
 Wontonimo: Spacialman, something has helped me is at the beginning of every week to pick a small program (think hello world) and every day of that week code it using a text editor until you can do it from memory.  The next week, pick a different small program.  At the end of the month, that language will feel a LOT more natural to you and you won't be so dependant on autocomplete and google searches for basic stuff
 Spacialman: Okay, thank you very much Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: I do that maybe once every couple years when picking up a new language or framework.  The last time i did that was for angular, then before that it was tensorflow, then php, etc
 [Kian-carling]: hi
 Spacialman: Hey, how are you.
 Spacialman: Could someone help me real quick?
 Maexel: hi there
 Spacialman: hi
 Spacialman: how are you?
 ngdangtu: /me
 Spacialman:&#160;?
 Papaver: Hi&#160;:)
 Spacialman: Hi
 Papaver: Do you still need help?&#160;:)
 Spacialman: No, but thank you for asking
 Papaver: Ok ^^ Enjoy your evening
 Spacialman: Thank you very much.
 jacek: how to ask questions...
 Spacialman: What do you mean?
 jacek: ask specific question instead of "can someone help me?"
 Spacialman: Okay.
 Papaver: That would help the helpers!
 Spacialman: lol. Makes sense.
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: when you're so good you lose points by winning
 MSmits: in which game are you doing that?
 jacek: rebless losign points to kowi in bt
 MSmits: ahh
 reCurse: Eh
 Mr.Py: :ghost:
 MSmits: rating difference &gt; 12 i think reCurse or whatever the limit is
 jacek: huh? it leaderboard there is no green dot
 reCurse: Did that green dot ever work?
 jacek: eeyup
 reCurse: orly
 reCurse: So good news, I have a 3080. Bad news, now my RAM can't keep up :cry:
 Spacialman: Stick with the 3070
 reCurse:&#160;?
 Spacialman: It's what my dad uses and it's amazing
 reCurse: Ok cool, but I have a 3080 and it's amazing too
 reCurse: But I can't keep it fed because RAM doesn't keep up
 Spacialman: hmmm
 Spacialman: is it Geforce?
 reCurse: Yes
 jacek: god for you
 jacek: :unamused:
 reCurse: My code is all cache miss now
 reCurse: Eww
 reCurse: 85% dram stall lol, never seen that
 jacek: aww
 kovi: i broke my bt bot. what is the expected playout count there?
 reCurse: Playout?
 reCurse: In BT?
 kovi: oops
 kovi: yeah, i know mcts may not be best there
 reCurse: mcts and playouts are 2 different things
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: kovi I don't think we have numbers on that
 MSmits: the few people that do mcts, dont do a full random rollout
 jacek: only lette
 jacek: s
 MSmits: someone slap jacek around a litt
 MSmits: le
 jacek: i cant type
 kovi: hmm, yeah cant compare non-full
 ketchuponpizza: lol
 ketchuponpizza: mlo
 jacek: playout count is 1, you only need to know 1 best move [solved]
 reCurse: Your trolls are getting weaker
 MSmits: that's why i said to slap him around a little
 jacek: maybe next week ill get brand new pc
 reCurse: What is it
 jacek: why ryzen of course
 reCurse: So... details...?
 jacek: ryzen 5800x (16 threads), geforce 2060 rtx. right now i have athlon 860k :unamused: (4 not-so-full threads). so i expect big boost here
 reCurse: Pretty good upgrade yes
 jacek: and fortunately what im doing now is quite parallelizable
 kovi: nice jacek
 reCurse: Those cache miss make me question my cpu upgrade, might wait a bit
 reCurse: Besides rocket lake seems more like late q1 apparently :unamused:
 jacek: fsck intel, get amd&#160;:*
 reCurse: When I read about all problems people have with amd in general, and their lack of avx512...
 reCurse: Apparently it can be quite difficult to overclock your ram with a ryzen
 jacek: avx512 slows down the clock eh
 reCurse: Yes but if your throughput is higher and you stick to a high performance workflow who cares about the clock
 reCurse: What it's not good at is sporadic use, true
 reCurse: Oh and losing vtune... I can't quite bear the thought of that
 jacek: the vwhat
 reCurse: Intel's cpu profiler
 reCurse: Best in class
 AntiSquid: how much ram jacek&#160;?
 jacek: im gonna for 32gb
 AntiSquid: i don't understand your graphics card choice though
 jacek: it was the one available
 AntiSquid: no 3k series available&#160;?
 jacek: oO
 jacek: nope
 jacek: besides what im doing now isnt gpu intensive yet
 AntiSquid: why the oO, last i checked they were supposed to be same price, not sure how much the shortage dragged the prices up 
 reCurse: They're very hard to find, not sure how the situation is in europe though
 reCurse: Doubtful it's better
 jacek:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: UK is probably worse :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... A lot of people bought gpus preventively as the start of the covid crise. And now there's no more in stock.&#160;:/
 reCurse: As far as I understand it's a gddr6 shortage
 AntiSquid: preventively&#160;? more like bulk purchases and then auction sales
 jacek: nyoro~n
 reCurse: I think I need to revisit my whole pipeline god damnit
 BlaiseEbuth: They've probably realized that toilet paper will be more useful...
 reCurse: Well I'm not sure how preventively, but people need to stay entertained
 reCurse: Lots of people had no time for gaming, but now...
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... A lot of people have no more money to buy gpus...
 reCurse: You would think that, but there's also a lot who do
 BlaiseEbuth: The ones who suddenly inherited probably...
 jacek: :eyes:
 AntiSquid: :rolling_eyes:
 AntiSquid: where are gpus made better question, what slowed down transportation
 BlaiseEbuth: Not enough healthy chinese kids to produce them I guess.
 reCurse: Any more kneejerks we're missing?
 jacek: huh
 AntiSquid: well they probably had their door sealed in by the baoan 
 Westicles: keep in mind every so-called gpu sold is a bigger load on the people simulating our universe
 reCurse: Not sure a gpu comes close to simulating a person :p
 AntiSquid: how do you know that Westicles, the simulation gets slower for them but we would still experience same passage of time
 Westicles: Maybe they are HW limited?  These are tough times
 MSmits: AntiSquid is correct
 MSmits: it might be gpu induced time dilation
 reCurse: Is this why time goes so slow in meetings?
 MSmits: who knows, maybe they are at this moment, complaining of 85% cache misses
 MSmits: reCurse makes sense to me
 Westicles: Two puzzles in a row now where I have to call python eval from c++ to solve.  Very sloppy
 MSmits: what does that do?
 MSmits: call python eval from c++&#160;?
 Westicles: Fun with Set theory and Order of Oopserations!
 Westicles: eval can evaluate expressions (+,-,unions, etc)
 MSmits: ok
 jinpachi: hello
 ngdangtu: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

 KoliaYovko: Hello all, what does the "Score" in clashes mean?
 KoliaYovko: how does it counts?
 Westicles: percent of validators passed
 Uljahn: TrueSkill, search the forum for more info
 jacek: i think he meant the ones with 100%, 90% etc
 KoliaYovko: well, I found, some people got this number less than 0
 jacek: oO
 reCurse: "clashes"
 MSmits: damn bitboards, i just spend 3 hrs finding a bug where i shifted a 16 bit integer to the 18th bit, thinking it was a 32 bit integer =/

 MSmits: ail?
 reCurse: Paying my respects
 MSmits: oh
 kovi: finally some improvement on bt
 MSmits: cool, still random rollout?
 kovi: yeah
 MSmits: thats pretty impressive
 MSmits: what rank?
 kovi: ept ofc (before i got attacked)
 kovi: 7th
 kovi: top5 is probably minimax (+nn)
 MSmits: not bad at all
 jacek: :tada:
 kovi: also my start/advancement is totally noob
 kovi: rollouts dont tell what is a good opening
 MSmits: thats why you have opening books 
 jacek: :scream:
 reCurse: :unamused:
 kovi: here we go again?
 MSmits: relax, i am not suggesting he break your nn
 MSmits: just a general opening book is fine
 kovi: i would rather copy it
 kovi: interaction is low in the first 10 turn
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: maybe try the usual openings from the paper
 Westicles: I love the book argument.

 MSmits: I just realized something. If bots are extremely deterministic, you can just do man in the middle and let them play against themselves, hardcode the moves :P
 MSmits: they will beat themselves
 MSmits: never did that, but should work. Moral of the story, get some random in there
 reCurse: Just get some random :lul:
 MSmits: Your nn should be strong enough to be able to pick between two good moves
 MSmits: if their eval is close enoguh
 reCurse: I don't think you realize how much it weakens your strength
 MSmits: well it's hard for me to guess, but I assume that when there is 1 winning move, there might be more than 1
 reCurse: So you know what the good move is
 reCurse: So you spend more time searching into it to prepare
 reCurse: Except now you need to find another good move and split your efforts
 MSmits: no thats not what i mean
 MSmits: say you have 8 moves to choose from
 reCurse: I understand what you mean
 reCurse: But those cases you mention are very rare
 jacek: dont you use softmax in your selfplays?
 MSmits: 2 have eval 0,91 and 0,90, the rest are &lt;0,5
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: You need to provoke it to happen often enough
 reCurse: And that costs
 MSmits: hmm, it should not cost the search itself
 reCurse: Of course it does
 MSmits: i meant to only add random to the final move selection
 reCurse: You don't get a good value out of one eval
 reCurse: You need to spend a lot more than that
 jacek: i use random in my uct, and it works somehow
 reCurse: That random at the beginning can be catastrophic
 reCurse: The beginning is where it's most unsure
 reCurse: So small differences in eval is all that tells you where the good move is
 MSmits: makes sense
 reCurse: The actual irony is the good way to counter that is to prepare a varied opening book with longer thinking time to make sure they're good moves
 reCurse: But fuck me I've got better things to spend time/compute on
 MSmits: btw, i had a thought the other day about NN vs opening books. Say you play a random game like onitama
 MSmits: it's harder to train a random game than the same game with fixed openings isnt it?
 MSmits: the NN has less variety to deal with
 reCurse: Eh, it might be the other way around actually
 MSmits: i am assuming the opponent does not use any books or anything
 reCurse: You don't need to worry as much about exploring enough
 reCurse: The randomness provides implicit generalization
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: ok, then let me rephrase. The final bot will play better moves, if you were able to get past this problem 
 jacek: that could be reason why td-gammon worked so well, you have random from the game
 MSmits: sure, but you can introduce this random yourself cant you?
 MSmits: it's just  alittle more work
 reCurse: Yeah and it's another art form to pile with the rest
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but what i meant is not the "hard" for the creator
 jacek: yes, to provide different experience for the nn
 MSmits: but for the bot itself
 reCurse: No no no
 reCurse: It's hard for the creator that has to fine tune
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: Exploration strategy is another thing to fine tune
 reCurse: If the game has random starts, no need to worry about it as much
 kovi: ok, im done uttt and bit for a whilewhich other game is good for mcts?
 MSmits: but, the bot should eventually be able to play a fixed opening game better than a random opening game, assuming you got past this problem, is what i am saying. Assuming you fixed the randomness
 jacek: bandas? :thinking:
 reCurse: Only do bandas if you hate your life
 reCurse: I don't think that's necessarily true
 MSmits: bandas is the only good game for fully random rollouts besides uttt
 MSmits: ok, let me use an example
 Astrobytes: Because it's shit?
 reCurse: Either it generalizes or it doesn't
 MSmits: othello really does have different gamestages
 kovi: thx.recurse: you mean i shouldnt even try to find heuristics?
 MSmits: non-NN bots use separate evals for early, mid and endgame
 reCurse: kovi: Most games in bandas start extremely favored for one player, so it doesn't matter much what you do
 MSmits: so it's not that weird to assume a NN will use different parts of its network
 kovi: oh lol
 MSmits: if the early game is very similar, doesnt it require a lot less NN "space" to play well
 reCurse: Sure but I don't see any reason why it would play fixed openings better
 kovi: yeah, i wanted to mentioned that msmits
 kovi: if the opening can be separated
 reCurse: NN doesn't encode opening books
 reCurse: It finds patterns
 MSmits: of course
 reCurse: How much "space" is needed for it is extremely arbitrary
 MSmits: but what if the opening patterns are different
 reCurse: You can make those assumptions
 reCurse: *can't
 MSmits: for example with forced openings
 MSmits: what if you trained it on a fixed start
 MSmits: but then it had to play forced openings
 MSmits: what would that do?
 xSAAPx: henlo
 MSmits: or what if your UTTT NN was forced to start in the top left corner
 MSmits: instead of the middle
 reCurse: That's hard to assume anything about
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: even though it does not hardcode openings
 MSmits: it may still "make use" of the fact that the opening is fixed
 jacek: just like human
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: so you're still kinda training it to play openings
 Angecide: that's interesting
 reCurse: But that doesn't say anything about how it generalized
 reCurse: For all you know it generalized well enough that it would play just as well on an opening it didn't see
 MSmits: true, thats hard to guess
 reCurse: In fact that's the biggest point of all that
 reCurse: You're working very hard to get it to generalize and not overfit
 reCurse: If your fixed start caused it to overfit you probably needed to finetune it better
 reCurse: Unless the fixed start is so wildly different, then ok maybe
 MSmits: sure, but you dont train it on states that will never be encountered in areal game
 MSmits: maybe at first
 reCurse: You are training it with the expectation it will understand unseen positions
 reCurse: Hence, generalization
 reCurse: Let me put it this way
 reCurse: Open a random chess puzzle
 reCurse: It's possible it's played out of a position/opening you never do
 reCurse: But you'll start applying your knowledge to find patterns
 reCurse: Analyze weaknesses
 reCurse: etc.
 reCurse: NN does the same
 MSmits: yes but this assume the early game and mid/late game can use the same generalizations
 MSmits: if the early game is a completely different beast, it might not be generalized well
 MSmits: and might not need to be either
 reCurse: What I'm saying is you'll have to skew your early game very hard
 reCurse: For it to have an effect
 reCurse: Like say trade queens on move 5 and it never knows a queen even exists
 reCurse: Then ok, sure.
 reCurse: Who cares
 MSmits: well i am just wondering about uttt here, because the early game is so different from late game
 MSmits: quite hard to play for a regular bot
 MSmits: your bot did seem to come up with teccles heuristic
 reCurse: It did
 MSmits: or whatever nn equivalent it is
 reCurse: Also came up with interesting strategy I can't quite word
 MSmits: letting opponent win a board by using too many marks?
 reCurse: Confining a player to specific boards
 reCurse: While taking over the rest
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: thats the same thing
 reCurse: I guess
 MSmits: if you win a board, you want it to be won with a small margin
 MSmits: not with +3 marks
 MSmits: otherwise you lose everywhere else
 kovi: hmm, good point
 MSmits: karliso mentioned this a while ago
 kovi: so it is an early sign of weakness
 MSmits: like a year, he never put it into his bot i think, but he says his bot does this
 reCurse: I'm rather ecstatic it discovered it by itself tbh
 kovi: i may try penalty there
 jacek: yeah
 MSmits: sure, but it's supposed to, if it hadn't it wouldnt be nr 1
 RileyT: I'm new
 jacek: its awesome to see your bot find good strategies on its own
 MSmits: kovi you might not need a penalty, you should just lose games where you do it wrong
 MSmits: so random might pick it up
 reCurse: That's why I think getting to chess will be a rabbit hole I won't get out of
 MSmits: jacek agreed
 jacek: especially unorthodox ones that are weird but good
 kovi: recurse: the good thing is that you realized it....for a more complex thing we will not be able
 kovi: to understand
 MSmits: reCurse it might not be workable to try and do a NN for chess in the CG limitations
 MSmits: but you want to do it elsewhere?
 MSmits: right?
 reCurse: Says who
 reCurse: No one thought CG limitations would allow NNs
 reCurse: And here we are
 MSmits: sure, but i did say "might"
 jacek: at very least, you can do NN PST that would be better than regular PST
 MSmits: PST?
 jacek: piece square table
 reCurse: Do these work in 960?
 MSmits: should work fine for endgames
 jacek: why wouldnt they
 MSmits: 960 has the same endgames
 reCurse: I'm unclear whether it would overvalue a bishop on b2, say, because it's always starting at c1
 reCurse: Would it still be good if it was not as reachable
 reCurse: shrug
 MSmits: oh are we not talking about endgame tables here
 MSmits: just piece values?
 reCurse: piece square table
 reCurse: Value of piece on square
 MSmits: ahhhh
 MSmits: that might be different near the start I guess
 jacek: may be different for midgame and endgame
 MSmits: endgame, doubtful
 reCurse: I have the impression it might overvalue bishop b2/g2, but in 960 maybe it wouldn't care
 reCurse: For example

 kovi: just checked that
 kovi: chess is so ... overengineered
 jacek: when i touch chess again im gonna rewrite bot to bitboards for starters
 kovi: i like to discover things
 reCurse: Yeah I share your opinion
 MSmits: oh yeah, that is another thought i had. NNs seem to win on a lot of simple CG games. I wonder what happens if we applied the same overengineering to some of those here on CG. I mean we never go *that* far coming up with good evals
 MSmits: would the NNs still be beatable?
 reCurse: That's why I like the NN approach a lot
 reCurse: There's still a lot of ground to uncover imo
 jacek: MSmits well nnue beats classical eval much
 reCurse: Meh.
 MSmits: nnue?
 reCurse: I don't like nnue
 jacek: nn for stockfish (and other alpha-beta engines), when introduced it gave +100 elo
 reCurse: I feel they're going to hit a brick wall when no one works on classic eval anymore, what will they use as bootstrap
 jacek: like 2-3 years strength increase in 2 months
 jacek: the ones existing now?
 kovi: stockfish beat leela 
 kovi: (again)
 reCurse: To me that matchup would be a lot more interesting in tighter constraints
 reCurse: Giving that much time to stockfish lets it calculate so deep it's kind of stupid
 kovi: yeah, invite them here
 jacek: you have ccrl and others for that
 jacek: tcec is to see what gods would play
 MSmits: they would have a lot of work minifying their bots. Also they depend a lot on huge tablebases&#160;:)
 jacek: not that i understand chess anyway
 kovi: seems that only trictrac has reasonable bot atm. or are there more?
 reCurse: Not that I know of
 reCurse: Once I beat checkers I may get to it
 jacek: or the 2nd or 3rd
 jacek: my is just material for 3-4 plies
 reCurse: kovi: To answer your question about whether we would understand it, I am convinced there is a way to architecture NNs in a way that facilitates understanding.
 kovi: interesting point
 reCurse: Makes me think of CAM (class activation maps) that generates heatmaps on a picture so we can see what helped in the classification
 reCurse: Minor change to architecture that allows that kind of inspection
 MSmits: but would that be enough to tell you what is happening?
 MSmits: isnt the problem that the patterns that get trained are very complicated?
 reCurse: Figure out what you need to know and find a way that it becomes visible
 MSmits: so the NN is too good to understand
 reCurse: And prevent those complex patterns from happening
 MSmits: but if you prevent it... you interfered with it
 MSmits: makes me think of quantum mechanics
 reCurse: Of course that's the whole point
 reCurse: The optimization will find a way
 reCurse: Just like we introduce regularization so it doesn't overfit on certain things
 reCurse: We interfered, for a good reason

 MSmits: yeah ok, but some patterns are complex, because they need to be
 MSmits: it's always gonna be hard to understand those
 reCurse: You can still skew it towards something you understand better
 reCurse: Not saying it's easy
 reCurse: But there's plenty of examples we did just that
 MSmits: yeah ok
 reCurse: Exploiting spatial coherence with convnets for instance
 Grelak: quick question, I just made my first clash of code, it seems the ranking at the end is rated with number of characters so using scripting languages like python will be better than for example the C# which includes parsing?
 jacek: shortest mode, yes
 jacek: its about characters count only
 Grelak: ah, I assume there're other modes like speed and things like that then, thanks!
 3ataja: there three modes, Reverse, Fast and Shortest
 HuynhNgocHai: How can i become dev&#160;?
 HuynhNgocHai: I'm just student
 KGDavidson: what does reverse mode mean
 zapakh: It means you don't get a problem description, so you have to figure out what to do based on the test cases.
 KGDavidson: oh right thanks
 khang2003: down code
 jacek: happy Caturday

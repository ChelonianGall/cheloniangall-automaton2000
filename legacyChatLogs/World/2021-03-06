 Maverick_ak: Hi
 gNozo: yo 
 gNozo: are you guys devs? 
 MDog: Grind TC
 gNozo: fangmula
 Maverick_ak: what is grindtc
 Kaleab: Why are the questions easy?
 gNozo: ur not smart
 MDog: Grind TC
 MDog: means grind total compensation
 MDog: means get your programming skills up in order to earn a higher salary
 Kaleab: why are the questions so easy?
 PaoloBettelini: what questions
 Kaleab: clash of code competing questions
 Uljahn: because they are supposed to be solved in under 10 minutes? if you need harder puzzles feel free to visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a> and choose the desired difficulty
 PaoloBettelini: is there a way to see all the completed puzzles?
 jacek: in puzzles page you can see completed puzzles at the bottom
 PaoloBettelini: thanks
 MSmits: hey jacek... 27.5k games now on clobber... all starting moves get closer to 50% with more games. First time I've seen that with a game
 MSmits: probably a sign my bot has no idea how to play this game :P
 MSmits: if mcts doesnt converge on good moves, 50% seems right
 MSmits: maybe it will be different with millions of games,... no idea
 darkhorse64: easy bot, if (firstMove) play(rand(112)
 MSmits: well at least the first turn will be ok&#160;:)
 MSmits: you could maybe get a slightly better bot by choosing random on your turn and then start searching from the selected node. Get a headstart on next turn
 MSmits: assuming reusing of tree of course
 MSmits: I saw nine men's morris in contributions too
 MSmits: I remember finding this game when i was young and having no idea what to do with it, just played it like a weird TTT
 darkhorse64: More seriously, there are known strategies for Clobber and starting on borders and starting in the middle is different. So you could sort of first preferred move as white and search from it
 MSmits: oh I see
 darkhorse64: could have
 darkhorse64: You see, it was only half a joke
 MSmits: yeah apparently
 MSmits: I think it's ok they put nine men's morris on there. I will treat it as a puzzle to get a perfect playing bot on there
 darkhorse64: I read nine men morris is solved as a win for White but can(t find the reference anymore
 MSmits: because it was solved in 1993
 MSmits: I found it
 MSmits: I think it's a good solution to treat the solved games as puzzles and not be worried about the ladder being competitive
 darkhorse64: Provided it fits within a 20s frame time
 MSmits: no i mean
 MSmits: just keep it as a multi
 darkhorse64: ok
 MSmits: but us players will view it as a puzzle instead of complaining that it is solved
 MSmits: there's always someone complaining about that, but there are plenty of unsolved multis to choose from 
 MSmits: it's still quite a challenge to put the knowledge in your bot required to play perfectly in 50 ms turn time
 MSmits: requires retrograde analysis for endgames, probably an opening book as well
 darkhorse64: Definitely
 MSmits: nmm has some simd opportunities as well
 MSmits: similar to TTT with masking
 MSmits: instead of winmasks, you have millmasks
 darkhorse64: I'm not very talkative. I am trying to write a ab boss for Clobber in order to release the multi and move on to something else
 MSmits: ah yeah, i need to go do some stuff also... lots of work and study stuff.
 MSmits: ttyl&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: morning
 awnion: .chunk_while in ruby probably the most amazing method I've seen so far :p
 tibithegreat: in the escape.codingame thing, is there a way to change my profile? I was on my phone when I created the account and I accidentally clicked that I am not a coder
 tibithegreat: and the first game says at least 1 coder is needed to start the game
 awnion: Yeah, it's quite unfortunate to be a 0 coder :P
 CryptoZenith: yo
 Michael_48: these java schmucks
 Michael_48:&#160;:(
 awnion: java was set up to be as painful as possible :joy:
 jacek: oO
 CryptoZenith: could not agree more
 CryptoZenith: personally prefer it over python, however
 jacek: use jython [solved]
 awnion: for me java sucks mostly because you can't control or predict performance: it's like it's performant in average, it randomly kicks out data from cpu cache and all this "good staff"
 tridvajedan: what the fuck is jython
 awnion: :joy: java implementation of python with "real threads" :joy:
 tridvajedan: wow
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=jython">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=jython</a>
 tridvajedan: java &lt; python sorry my opinion
 FlyHead: C# = java++
 Wontonimo: interesting, the &lt; and &gt; symbol comes from measuring weight.  so you are saying java weighs less than python.  From a functions/sec, yes python is heavier than java.
 FlyHead: i wouldn't compare java with python
 awnion: C# could be really good like Rust now but was ruined 
 awnion: python is new java, and I can't tell that I like it...
 FlyHead: if your company isn't thrilled about writing tests, you really don't want to be using python for critical systems
 awnion: )))) horible mistake
 FlyHead: a lot of the issues you find will only be found at runtime
 FlyHead: java at least has the safety provided by the compiler... unless you're overusing reflection or something weird
 awnion: typing system is a fake safety
 FlyHead: it's a lot safer than nothing though
 FlyHead: i speak from experience&#160;:/
 awnion: it's horrible mistake, i'm really tired to explain why
 awnion: all you have from typing system is performance + better ide support
 FlyHead: ... and the compiler making sure you aren't trying to .split() an int in a rarely used branch of code
 FlyHead: you could have a good linter find something like that, sure
 awnion: you fight to wrong direction
 awnion: in short: you want "my code should not break", real life is like "everything breaks just make everything break tolerant"
 awnion: that's why math &gt; programming
 awnion: if you want something that's not generalizable you probably want now what you think you want, and It will break looooong after all tests
 Wontonimo: i agree with you both.  awnion, i agree with you for projects under 5,000 lines.  FlyHead, I agree with you for projects over 50,000 lines
 Scarfield: i disagree with you all 3, no reason, just in spite :p
 Wontonimo: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: such humble words Scarfield
 Astrobytes: Pff. YOU ARE ALL WRONG. The end.
 Scarfield: incomprehensible humble, as always
 Passifi: The real reason Python sucks is the way the code looks and we all know that :P
 Astrobytes: Humblefield.
 Scarfield: CorrecstroBytes
 struct: python syntax is not that bad
 Scarfield: which is better, apples or bananas?
 Wontonimo: what's the problem with the syntax?  i don't get the issue
 awnion: It's not about syntax, I personally don't mind any language syntax. The problem is in most cases it wrong understanding of problem field. It cause more bug than anything else combined.
 Theino: One hundred thousand people die each year from snake bites. Don't contribute to the problem, stay away from python!
 awnion: How many died from malaria? :P
 Wontonimo: 10,038 deaths were reported in Java between 2007-2008, we should avoid Java also
 Scarfield: xD
 Passifi: Well western people don't die of Malaria so its all good&#160;:) but snakes are everywhere
 RSBat: Want a really safe language? Use Idris!
 awnion: In Russia I've never seen a single snake. Probably because it's -34C right now :p
 Wontonimo: inside
 awnion: No language is safe until it's used by a human
 Passifi: I'm sure there are snakes in russia you just need to get out of our urban ivory tower awnion :P visit the raw rural russia for once
 Passifi: I think that statement needs to be reversed awnion A language by itsel 
 Passifi: f is never dangerous&#160;;)
 Passifi: except maybe for french
 darkhorse64: For all interested, the boss has been updated for the Clobber contribution
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Astrobytes: Call him ClobberSan
 darkhorse64: Ahh, need to RTFM
 darkhorse64: Does someone knows how to change the boss name in a multi contribution
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Thanks
 struct: I dont think its possible
 darkhorse64: Another privilege from CG&#160;? :relaxed:
 struct: I guess, it would be a nice addition, but I think there is probably more important stuff
 jacek: a/b boss?
 cricri10000: Yes.
 cricri10000: damn alt
 Scarfield: :scream:
 Astrobytes: ScarScream.
 Scarfield: AltstroBytes
 cricri10000: Better than cricriBytes :smirk:
 jacek: clopperboss
 AntiSquid: who are the approval candidates for clobber&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Approval candidates?
 darkhorse64: Who is willing to approve this crap&#160;?
 darkhorse64: personal translation
 darkhorse64: :grinning:
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Theino: Speaking of approvals, I need two more for my contribution. (Plus 3 more up votes for xp): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63618707a685d8557571cabb82f9ed5b28d9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63618707a685d8557571cabb82f9ed5b28d9</a>
 Astrobytes: Hm, since you specifically asked for them I am tempted to reject and downvote :P
 AntiSquid: i meant it as: who are the likely culprits to approve it before it's ready
 jacek: feet? inches? :unamused:
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: anyone comes to mind?
 AntiSquid: downvoted for not using metric system, sorry, but it's a big no! 
 Astrobytes: Well, it's been tested in a pretty hardcore fashion, especially the last few days
 darkhorse64: Clobber is in WIP and will stay as long as necessary
 AntiSquid: troll vs castles has been tested enough, but i wonder what is missing to move it forward 
 AntiSquid: where's JBM anyway
 darkhorse64: XP&#160;?
 Theino: sad, people actually did downvote it lol. It was originally in metric, but that was too easy
 AntiSquid: there's a limited number of actives i think
 AntiSquid: theino i told you why
 Astrobytes: Theino: I didn't. I don't clash so I don't go near clash contribs&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: (looks fine at first glance fwiw)
 Theino: AntiSquid, I wrote it first in metric and someone complained that it was too easy and suggested I make it so you have to convert from imperial...&#160;:(
 Theino: I can't win lol
 jacek: use something other than metric and imperial [solved]
 AntiSquid: SI
 Astrobytes: It's fine as it is. The explanation of the imperial measurements is there in the statement. I agree metric would have been too easy (even for a clash). Just imo 
 jacek: i was joking about metric
 AntiSquid: it's 1 person audience he catered and made the changes for
 AntiSquid: i'd say he picked the wrong crowd, unless you want to approve it
 Astrobytes: I can't approve clashes. I haven't done enough, because I don't clash.
 AntiSquid: theino i give 3rd approval if i see it's metric @_@ promise
 Westicles: Change it to BMI on different planets and I will approve
 AntiSquid: ^ i don't mind that
 jacek: youre not fat. youre just too short
 Astrobytes: lol
 Theino: or on the wrong planet
 AntiSquid: actually if you are slightly too bulky because of muscles you're basically overweight according to BMI
 struct: Well muscle mass also adds weight
 Scarfield: yea BMI is not a great tool for athletes, when i played volleyball i was overwheight with fat percentage &lt; 10
 SpearsAndEagles: ye but if BMI says you're overweight you probably are
 AntiSquid: if you go see a doctor they won't count you as overweight though
 AntiSquid: at least here .
 Astrobytes: BMI is a rough guide, other factors need to be considered by the examining physician.
 AntiSquid: and last i had to do one (they checked BMI for staff to see who is at risk lol) it also asked activity level, how much exercise we do each week
 AntiSquid: theino maybe you could somehow include exercise / activity&#160;?
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: nutrition as well
 Westicles: Maybe add a lipid panel as well?
 yash2709: hello

 Astrobytes: I'll pass, thank you.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/">https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/</a> this one even asks ethnic group not sure how that factors in, especially for mixed individuals
 Theino: Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups with a BMI of 23 or more have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes and other long term illnesses
 AntiSquid: Maverick_ak yash2709 NO
 jacek: oO
 Maverick_ak: what is grind tc?
 yash2709: how much software developer salaries in your country guys
 yash2709: im from india, avg a fresher gets is about 5000$ a year

 AntiSquid: are you typing from 2 accounts or what
 struct: yash I think this is information you can easily find online
 jacek: time crystal
 Scarfield: town center
 Astrobytes: Traffic Cop
 AntiSquid: so the kittensgame has time crystals? is it fun? Maverick_ak 
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes nobody grinds that please
 Astrobytes: I know plenty people who wouldn't mind grinding some traffic cops
 Astrobytes: (take that whatever way you like)
 AntiSquid: :thinking: :couple_with_heart:&#160;?
 Scarfield: grinding how im curious?
 Astrobytes: I meant using some kind of industrial grinding/milling machine but... 
 Scarfield: ah, makes a big difference xD
 AntiSquid: ya i know
 Astrobytes: You will note I did not say "grinding on some traffic cops"
 AntiSquid: less funny though, so :P
 AntiSquid: well depends ...
 Scarfield: true, but that wont stop be from purposely misunderstanding
 Astrobytes: Minefield
 Scarfield: me and my brother sometimes catch eachother in rephrasing a sentence, to avoid the other to "misunderstand" xD
 Westicles: Is Dr. Seuss a known name outside the US?
 Astrobytes: lol scarfield
 Astrobytes: Yes Westicles.
 AntiSquid: maybe some folks in UK&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i only know about it because the obomas were advertising it 
 Astrobytes: Who are the obomas?
 AntiSquid: barack and mike
 AntiSquid: michelle *
 Astrobytes: Obamas, ah. Was thinking the obomas was some organisation I hadn't heard of or something.
 AntiSquid: ya misspelt 
 AntiSquid: why Westicles want to discuss cancel culture? book burning&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Dr. Seuss has been known outside the US for decades tbh
 AntiSquid: hey i am sure it's popular in many countries, but not everyone is familiar with it
 Westicles: I was going to make a Dr. Seuss clash but wasn't sure about his reach
 AntiSquid: isn't it just a children's book? what clash can you make about it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, he was the *author* of many childrens books
 Maverick_ak: okay
 Maverick_ak: :grin:
 AntiSquid: yes, my bad, keep thinking of it as a collection of stories for kindergarten
 21stCenturyPeon: As long as everything you need is in the description, what it's about is just decoration
 Astrobytes: This is true.

 Silly_robot: hey, can I use pprint() for debuging?i tried adding 'file=sys.stderr, flush=True' but that's not working
 jacek: what language
 Silly_robot: python
 jacek: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Silly_robot: yeah, I know i can use print.the question is if I can use pprint
 jacek: today i learned about pprint. can pprint print to stderr?
 Silly_robot: im gonna check
 jacek: yes
 jacek: pprint.PrettyPrinter(stream=sys.stderr)
 Silly_robot: cool, thx
 nickyfoo97: does anyone know why my clash of code rank is written as 2260803 when i hover over my pic?

 seifiali84: hi
 seifiali84: i'm new programmeri just learning
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 tibithegreat: I didn't get an answer earlier so I'm gonna try again&#160;:). In the escape.codingame thing, can I change the programming experience thing? I was on my phone when I logged in and I accidentally clicked that I'm not a coder
 tibithegreat: and I didn't think it was important but the first puzzle says 1 coder required
 struct: I dont think it matters
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Should be fine when you start
 tibithegreat: oh
 Astrobytes: Anyone can write the code
 tibithegreat: ok then
 Astrobytes: Speaking of which, have they released anything new yet?
 struct: Dont think so
 Astrobytes: Meh. Shame. Was fun.
 jacek: fun?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's that part that comes before 'ction' or 'gus'
 reCurse: or 'eral'
 Astrobytes: Ah, damn, how did I miss putting the 'fun' in 'funeral'&#160;:(
 jacek: thats some jacekism in there
 Astrobytes: Fix your jacekisms jacek, you should've thought of it first.
 jacek: my trolling is weakening
 jacek: AutomatonNN help plx
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to complete it in the past for the moderator and i don't know why I don
 jacek: and Automaton2000 too
 Automaton2000: so i was looking at that
 Astrobytes: reCurse: any plans to do Clobber with your ML framework? Looks suitable.
 jacek: maybe you will succeed
 Astrobytes: They need to fix Automaton NN to ping you jacek, or whoever, now that we are sans euler
 reCurse: Nah taking a break from that
 Astrobytes: Gaming interlude?
 reCurse: Besides I found going for breadth takes more effort than I'm willing to put
 reCurse: I'd rather go for depth this time
 Astrobytes: That's a fair goal.
 reCurse: But I'm having a hard time finding a motivation to go for depth on whatever is up here
 reCurse: I'm thinking of doing some chess ML analysis maybe (not for CG)
 Astrobytes: You can also take Clobber, Amazons and maybe another 1 or 2? That are played in Olympiads on 10x10 or more boards. Makes things a lot more interesting.
 reCurse: Motivation being?
 Astrobytes: Something to do innit. That's all I got&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: But - you might end up beating records.
 reCurse:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Competitively. If you competed.
 Astrobytes: Other than that you can analyse the games.
 Astrobytes: Same motivation as studying chess.
 reCurse: No the motivation is different
 Astrobytes: Clobber's probably a bit too combinatorial, Amazons is a bit more worthwhile.What's your chess motivation?
 reCurse: Analyzing the human aspect
 Zenoscave: Two months til the next Challenge still?
 cricri10000: I can get with that I guess reCurse, the more abstract games do have more of a computer-based focus.
 cricri10000: Oh, a wild Zenoscave appears
 reCurse: Who's smurf is that
 cricri10000: Oh damn, this is my alt
 cricri10000: AStrobytes
 Zenoscave: astro's
 cricri10000: Hover over it
 Zenoscave: It's in the bio&#160;;)
 reCurse: Not using webchat
 Zenoscave: Gotcha
 cricri10000: Ah ok, well it's me
 reCurse: What for?
 Zenoscave: I'm me too
 Astrobytes: It's me
 Astrobytes: Or him
 reCurse: What is the smurf for?
 Astrobytes: Was using it for Clobber testing earlier
 reCurse: Ah
 Zenoscave: Are there any other squidwards I should know about?
 Astrobytes: Usually testing contribs 
 reCurse: Anyway my motivation is more philosophical I guess. It's not for competition.
 reCurse: I want to analyze what makes for good opponents for a human. More from a game design perspective among others.
 Astrobytes: You're never going to escape from that hole if you explore it you know.
 reCurse: Another track is game analysis that humans can make sense of.
 reCurse: Could even become a service if somehow it ends up working wildly well.
 Zenoscave: I would consider it a worthy hole, myself.
 reCurse: So anyway, I have lots of itches to scratch there.
 reCurse: And would cut me off CG :P
 Astrobytes: Sounds good. Don't disappear completely though please, you have some value amongst some of us you know :P
 jacek: especially kidneys
 Zenoscave: Wait are we harvesting kidneys?
 reCurse: Eh, I think I kind of want out though. We'll see.
 Zenoscave: I must've been absent for too long. That's a large change in platform.
 jacek: where
 Zenoscave: Kidney harvesting
 Astrobytes: Hm. There needs to be an ex-CG discord or something then reCurse
 Astrobytes: I have euler withdrawals currently
 Zenoscave: Wait is euler gone?
 darkhorse64: I am reading a chess book:"The Complete Chess Swindler" from David Smerdon. Obviously, it's very chess oriented but it explains quite well how to play the human part of us
 reCurse: What is its target audience?
 Astrobytes: As in what drives our strategies and goals?
 darkhorse64: chess players
 reCurse: I mean, what kind?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: Which type of chess player does the book target
 Astrobytes: reCurse: you're welcome as always :P
 reCurse: I'm lost
 Astrobytes: I'm translating your questions again
 reCurse: I thought it was clear&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: Anyone can read the book. There are no long lines of theory
 reCurse: Ok
 inoryy: reCurse is that a work project or personal interest?
 reCurse: inoryy: Personal interest
 Astrobytes: a wild inoryy appears!
 inoryy: hello!
 Astrobytes: hey hey, how's it going? Didn't see you for a good while.
 Zenoscave: Hi inoryy! Did you have an urge to check in here as well?
 darkhorse64: you can find sample pages here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.newinchess.com/the-complete-chess-swindler">https://www.newinchess.com/the-complete-chess-swindler</a>

 DomiKo: So many people here today
 jacek: power of the Caturday
 DomiKo: Caturday is real
 Zenoscave: I guess it is a caturday. I've lost all track of time lately
 inoryy: yeah, I sometimes get curious what's up&#160;:) been here a week or so ago too
 Zenoscave: inoryy: Still working with deepmind stuff?
 inoryy: Zenoscave yep, still unpublished though so can't talk unfortunately
 reCurse: Is there anywhere I can subscribe as to when it gets published? :P
 Zenoscave: Well best of luck then! Publish quick!!!
 darkhorse64: It' already published
 darkhorse64: It's
 reCurse: Sorry meant inoryy's work
 darkhorse64: Sorry
 inoryy: reCurse DM's blog? :P
 reCurse: Meh
 jacek: direct message's blog?
 inoryy: alright, how about a more cheeky answer then: hopefully it'll create enough buzz that you'll see it either way
 reCurse: Now that's interesting
 jacek: is it bioengineering cat girls?
 reCurse: I said interesting not creepy
 inoryy: that's.. out of my field of expertise
 Astrobytes: Enough buzz? It's bees right.We've seen the X-Files.
 jacek: thats out of everyone's field of expertise&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Creepon Husk seems to have it as a goal jacek, follow him.
 inoryy: Astrobytes well now I'll have to take you out with my bees army
 jacek: who?
 Astrobytes: inoryy :grin:
 Astrobytes: Look forward to the update regardless.
 Astrobytes: jacek: That creepy guy with the rockets
 inoryy: elon musk?
 Astrobytes: That's what I said! Creepon Husk!
 jacek: oh?
 inoryy: oh wow you actually meant him, haha
 darkhorse64: Given deepmind track record, "enough buzz" is going to be a landslide
 inoryy: I mean that was just a cheeky retort to reCurse's "meh", don't read *too* much into it :P
 reCurse: Well I just meant to say I'd be more interested knowing you worked on it
 Astrobytes: +1
 inoryy: Well I'll def share it on twitter&#160;:)
 reCurse: Sounds good
 Astrobytes: Who uses that :rolling_eyes:
 inoryy: :nerd:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Anyway nice to see you around inoryy. How's London atm?
 inoryy: anyway, didn't mean to divert the discussion; wanted to comment that it's a cool idea but many have tried and failed before reCurse so there be dragons
 reCurse: Oh I'm aware naturally
 Astrobytes: That's why I mentioned the hole
 reCurse: Competing on CG is a hole
 Astrobytes: But who can resist slaying a dragon?! :D
 Astrobytes: Wrong kinda hole reCurse
 inoryy: Astrobytes it's.. okay. people are finally taking things seriously, cases dropping and vaccines rolling out. there's some light at the end of the tunnel, I might actually get to explore the city 1.5 years after moving :D
 inoryy: How about Scotland?
 Astrobytes: inoryy: that's good to hear! Yeah, getting better, I should receive the vaccine in June at some point. Still a lot of idiots but it's reasonable for the most part. Teenagers are the worst (for obvious reasons)
 inoryy: yes, teenagers are the worst! *shakes fist at the cloud*
 Astrobytes: Heh! :older_man:
 Astrobytes: Nah, they're really awful. They even argue with the staff at the supermarket at being forced to wear a mask.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hormones don't wear masks
 Astrobytes: I'm fairly confident about the situation overall but I'm concerned that people will drop their guard too quickly upon easing of lockdown.I think we'll be facing a fair number of waves in the next year or 2
 Astrobytes: But the vaccines are a massive boost in that regard
 inoryy: yeah, you're probably right&#160;:/
 inoryy: ^ that's in response to addtional waves, not the vaccine lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah I got ya
 UnnamedCodinGamer: fair number of waves.. i have the feeling that most of the people already had it - for the others there are the vaccines
 Astrobytes: I'm naturally pessimistic but I don't think that this is the plague to end us. WE have much worse coming + climate change issues.
 Westicles: Oooh, we are doing all the hoaxes today!
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes, i love how your optimism about the plague is based on your pessimism about other things
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Thank you! Antibiotic resistant infections are probably the most current threat. Exacerbated by whatever virus happens to be going around, both of these are exacerbated by climate change (release of previously unknown pathogens from melt-water, from deforestation etc)
 darkhorse64: and permafrost
 Wontonimo: i'll fuel your pessimism Astrobytes and say this:  if one wanted to really make an aweful virus, one would make as many copies of it as possible, in as many locations as possible, and only make it harder for it to live but not kill it.
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: if can't survive in the air more than 5 min and 3 meters, make sure you tell people it's okay to be around eachother for 3 min and 2 meters
 Wontonimo: helps it evolve
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: Yeah, see melt-water in my post
 Wontonimo: make sure public policy is such that when we start to have our numbers of infections go down, to loosen up on restrictions so people go out again
 Wontonimo: just saying
 Astrobytes: Well that's the herd immunity approach in a nutshell right&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I admit I do find the whole thign very strange.
 Astrobytes: *thing.
 Wontonimo: that herd is on direct path to a cliff.  herd immunity don't mean anything when immunity only lasts 3 months
 darkhorse64: Good news: it lasts longer

 Wontonimo: Westicles, that's from for-profit labs.  Nothing bad could come from that
 Wontonimo: i joke, but in actuality I will be getting a shot when it is available in Canada
 Westicles: Here in the US half the people are going nuts trying to get to the front of the line, the other half figuring out strategies to avoid
 Astrobytes: Yes Wontonimo, they completely got the wrong end of the stick with herd immunity. That takes decades at least.

 AntiSquid: 99% survival rate ... also had to self-isolate 3 times, asymptomatic each time, wife works on covid ward ... not to mention lots of different tiny details that don't add up ... ya hard to gaf after a while
 Westicles: Yep.  This will be in the history books for centuries under the heading 'mass hysteria'
 Westicles: And in all the best books on propaganda 
 Wontonimo: where are you getting 99%?  It's 97% of closed cases.  For comparison the flu has a 99.8% survival rate.

 Bandar22: hi
 antiwonto: [auto] 'hi' was defined as ' A common salutation for those who are short of words ' by Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey antiwonto, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 91 tacos
 Bandar22: 5DN1L 11:39PMthey're probably all in the above urls
 RyanGilbert: antiwonto talking to itself
 StraumliPerversion: :taco: RyanGilbert
 antiwonto: [auto] StraumliPerversion has awarded RyanGilbert 1 tacos. RyanGilbert now has 1 taco. StraumliPerversion now has 17 taco
 StraumliPerversion: man, inflation... last week it was 10
 RyanGilbert: yeah avocado prices are through the roof man
 RyanGilbert: ranking up in clash is getting real tough top 200
 RyanGilbert: you move 1-2 places every 1st place game, but get clapped 20 ranks for 4th place RIP
 StraumliPerversion: yeah, then you take some time off and it decays 1,000 places
 derjack: :taco: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and i wasn't sure how to code first
 MrZee: I still don't know how to code, I just press buttons

 C26_1: Wow
 C26_1: My contribution is solved by a Twitter streamer
 C26_1: In Ruby
 xhr.s: yo in clash even though you finish twice as fast but you use more characters in a different language should definitely not make me finish in 3rd place
 5DN1L: for shortest mode, the scoring rule is score &gt; character count &gt; time
 5DN1L: for fastest and reverse modes, the scoring rule is score &gt; time
 5DN1L: languages can't be taken into account in clashes
 xhr.s: cool so what you're saying is stop using c++ against python
 5DN1L: or get lucky and hope all others score less than you
 xhr.s: aight thanks for clarifying
 DARKDRAGON532: @BSoD i remember playing with you in early 2021 xd

 5DN1L: BSoD ü§ñ&#160;: Thanks for remembering me
 eulerscheZahl: "My contribution is solved by a Twitter streamer"you can stream on twitter? when did that happen?
 nitekat: twitch maybe?
 InCog: new update on twitter 
 struct: euler I read that you are doing STC again

 xXCodinGamerXx: i did it
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: structi just have to handle the opponent somehow
 eulerscheZahl: standard minimax has too much branching, obviously
 eulerscheZahl: maybe MCTS forest does the trick
 RemoStein: geil
 Wontonimo: antiwonto was offline.  now back.  eulerscheZahl , continue to throw tacos to struct
 Wontonimo: what's MCTS forest?
 NewCoder09: :taco: Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [auto] NewCoder09 has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 188 taco. NewCoder09 now has 14 taco
 eulerscheZahl: some call it Smitsimax
 eulerscheZahl: for vanilla MCTS i fear that i would need more rollouts. and the actions of myself and opponent aren't coupled that tightly
 Mindarius: :taco: Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry Mindarius but you are too new.  Get someone to give you tacos first

 Mindarius: what are you guys working on?
 DannyRocko: i love you wonto
 DannyRocko: im scared
 DannyRocko: im a smol egirl
 NewCoder09: DannyRocko don't do this
 struct: eulerscheZahl what I did was try all moves up to depth 3/4
 struct: for both players
 struct: But I never finished my bot
 struct: also im not sure about smitsimax since opponent actions can impact yours
 struct: It might work though
 struct: also his AI sometimes starts at corners I dont see many doing this
 darkhorse64: Same here, it allows to predict if there is a devastating move from the opponent and try to counter it. I made Legend with that but still far from the top
 Salted: Hey, been trying to figure this out, what the heck is a pro account?
 darkhorse64: Two skull layers are pretty effective, one does nothing
 Salted: Like I'd be happy to pay a few dollars a month to get a batch next to my name or something to support this site. But I can't find anything about being a pro account on the site. 
 Salted: badge*
 Salted: Just noticed that some escape rooms require a pro account to unlock
 jacek: really?
 jacek: there is no "pro" account
 jacek: well, maybe for companies that use this site for recruitment
 Salted: Yeah, check out Activities-&gt;Cooperate and scroll down. Some puzzles are "pro account" only
 nulte: that is escape rooms yeah
 nulte: coop puzzles
 Salted: Yeah, so I work at a company who would pay for account. But we can't find any information on how to do that
 nulte: I would message [CG]Thibaud
 nulte: here or on discord I guess
 Salted: Ok I'll try discord. Thanks!
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm here
 StraumliPerversion: :taco: [CG]Thibaud
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry StraumliPerversion but you can only award tacos once per day
 struct: :taco: StraumliPerversion
 antiwonto: [auto] struct has awarded StraumliPerversion 10 tacos. StraumliPerversion now has 27 taco. struct now has 107 taco
 StraumliPerversion: many thanks
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 131 taco. jacek now has 103 taco
 Automaton2000: in fact i need to make it so that if you go for a walk
 Automaton2000: the thing is, i don't know if that helps

 nacho.code.ar: hello
 DingoGMD:             a
 DingoGMD: cool ik
 nacho.code.ar: someone working on MIME Type 
 DingoGMD: what is MIME
 nacho.code.ar: i really don't know what i'm doing here
 DingoGMD: same
 5DN1L: Have you done any coding before?
 nacho.code.ar: MIME python
 nacho.code.ar: yeap
 nacho.code.ar: but i really don't know the problem here
 5DN1L: You mean you don't understand the question, or what?
 nacho.code.ar: not get the string working
 5DN1L: what have you got
 nacho.code.ar: thrying to walkaroun the string variable
 nacho.code.ar: but it seems hard work
 5DN1L: still not clear what your question is? what code are you trying right now?
 nacho.code.ar: try to walk compare fname with ext variable 
 5DN1L: yes, and?
 nacho.code.ar: but i have not realize how till now
 nacho.code.ar: but i have not realized how till now
 5DN1L: what have you written so far
 nacho.code.ar: for i in  fname: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c98b5fc4-c948-4240-b599-690aaea88314">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c98b5fc4-c948-4240-b599-690aaea88314</a>
 5DN1L: have you converted to all uppercase or lowercase?
 nacho.code.ar: noneone
 5DN1L: because you have to standardise the case before you can compare
 5DN1L: the inputs can come in different cases
 nacho.code.ar: before that
 nacho.code.ar: in this case the input action doesn't trigger
 nacho.code.ar: does it is ok?
 5DN1L: can you paste your whole code here?
 nacho.code.ar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d3e1a97-0786-4680-81fb-680f499bd238">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d3e1a97-0786-4680-81fb-680f499bd238</a>
 5DN1L: ah so you haven't stored what you've read somewhere first
 5DN1L: you have to store them first for later use
 5DN1L: have you learned how to use a dictionary in python?
 nacho.code.ar: something 
 nacho.code.ar: but why the input action hasn't trigger
 nacho.code.ar: hasn't executed 
 Magmi: Please help me
 Magmi: where can i set editor to work with "unusual line ending"
 Magmi: i am using the python golfer cheating tool but it does not work properly
 5DN1L: nacho.code.ar "input()" reads the inputs, but you have to process them immediately, or you have to store them for later use
 5DN1L: input action is triggered when you execute the code
 5DN1L: but the question is what's read doesn't stay there for ever
 nacho.code.ar: but i haven't event receive the manual input request 
 5DN1L: one input() will overwrite another if you don't store what's read
 nacho.code.ar: it seems as the variables are charge by default
 5DN1L: the inputs are provided by the website
 5DN1L: they aren't manually input by you
 5DN1L: if that's what you're asking?
 nacho.code.ar: yes, that exactly
 Dren: yeah when your code has for i in fname:
 nacho.code.ar: in real wold that code must be ask me for the input
 Dren: it has no fname variable or list or dictionary to look anything up
 5DN1L: but here input() reads the data from the website, so you won't see any input prompt
 Dren: input here is just used to real the lines of raw input data provided
 nacho.code.ar: ok i still have to code dictionary input
 5DN1L: store the inputs in a dictionary, yes
 5DN1L: Magmi: I think the golfer may sometimes produce characters that cannot be compiled on CG or something
 5DN1L: Not sure if there's a solution to that
 nacho.code.ar: it should be really gratefull if we have voice chat 
 Magmi: CG says that I can solve it by setting editor.unusuualLineEnding
 Magmi: but where?
 5DN1L: oh
 5DN1L: in that case
 5DN1L: try SETTINGS on the left of the IDE
 5DN1L: then Editor Configuration
 Magmi: i see now thanks
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 WeirdCoder: Hew
 WeirdCoder: Hey
 nacho.code.ar: i don't remember python declaration rules
 5DN1L: google can help you
 nacho.code.ar: do you must be declare it before use it?
 5DN1L: nope
 5DN1L: normally not
 nacho.code.ar: dictionary?
 5DN1L: dictionary, list, set: yes
 5DN1L: sort of yes
 5DN1L: easier for you to declare first
 5DN1L: until you get familiar
 nacho.code.ar: yeap
 nacho.code.ar: you are wright
 AdemDj12: is there a way to implement and train an NN in less than 15 min
 OGWhisper: It depends what the NN is for...
 AdemDj12: simple 3-5 layers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darnit... 524k nodes using .5GB ... and still ran out of memory
 AdemDj12: lol
 nulte: how PatrickMcGinnisII?
 struct: Usually I use 700MB and dont run out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: local php cli...I'm just not re-using nodes in a DFS tree
 struct: ah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I could allocate more memory...but my log file tracking the search is already 62MB
 PatrickMcGinnisII: upped it to 1GB... 847k nodes ... still didn't find exhaustive solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: working on Number Shifting
 struct: ah
 struct: Never tried
 struct: But I know that one solution was found for it
 struct: I think marchete describes his implementation somewhere
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Have to do it local (offline), not enough time, lol
 struct: everyone did
 struct: marchete even rented servers :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx, reading it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did first 15 levels easily in IDE, lvl 16 is where I had to go local
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl always makes efficiency just next level harder

 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 UZUHAMA: Does anybody know why isn't chat showing in my screen
 Dren: I don'T know
 UZUHAMA: hmm...
 nacho.code.ar: stuck in  the MYME type
 nacho.code.ar: case 3
 nacho.code.ar: do someone know how to valdiate?
 [ron]: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 Dren: what's your code?
 nacho.code.ar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/22995d35-7f20-4416-8201-8d994d74431a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/22995d35-7f20-4416-8201-8d994d74431a</a>
 nacho.code.ar: how do you validate pdf but not .pdf?
 Dren: what role does the regex serve here?
 nacho.code.ar: validation of filename
 nacho.code.ar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d9fd2849-6747-4583-9654-1d2cf1ec2a88">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d9fd2849-6747-4583-9654-1d2cf1ec2a88</a>
 UZIHAMA: Oh
 UZIHAMA: you need to reach level 4 to use the chat
 nacho.code.ar: what does mean?
 UZIHAMA: That means you have to extract the file extension after the .
 nacho.code.ar: how do you filter the word after the .?
 Dren: you already used string.split('.')
 Dren: you can just snip off the last item there
 nacho.code.ar: ok
 Dren: that's why I don't see the point of the regex
 nacho.code.ar: look my output 
 nacho.code.ar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/749f01e6-95a7-4204-89ed-7cc3bd3d2541">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/749f01e6-95a7-4204-89ed-7cc3bd3d2541</a>
 nacho.code.ar: look the input 
 nacho.code.ar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85dd9b87-29a1-4bf3-8982-ac92cabe0651">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85dd9b87-29a1-4bf3-8982-ac92cabe0651</a>
 Dren: you need to find .pdf but not pdf so you only need validation that there is a . in the file name
 nacho.code.ar: codegame validate as good pdf 
 nacho.code.ar: codegame validate pdf  as good  
 Dren: no you missed the line
 Dren: if it did mp3 would work as well
 Dren: because both pdf and mp3 are in the inputs and they are also in the mime types
 Dren: normal pdf is the unknown input and .pdf is the one your code should process
 nacho.code.ar: compare my output with the input
 nacho.code.ar: codegame is validating .pdf as wrong
 Dren: no it doesn't
 Dren: put this into the interpreter
 Dren: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf0f4303-31de-4646-b069-be3a743bba0f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf0f4303-31de-4646-b069-be3a743bba0f</a>
 Dren: you can see that pdf is wrong and .pdf is right
 Dren: or rather it should be
 nacho.code.ar: but in my output is showing me as wrong
 nacho.code.ar: it must be application/pdf
 nacho.code.ar: but it said found: UNKNOWN
 Dren: oh yeah I know the problem
 nacho.code.ar: yes?
 Dren: the report..pdf doesn't pass your conditions
 Dren: because of the regex
 Dren: that's why I've been saying you don't need that
 nacho.code.ar: is it must be valid?
 Dren: yeah the only thing that matters is the .extension at the end
 Dren: it doesn't matter what is before that
 Husoski: You don't even need the .split().  Just use line.endswith('.pdf'), except with a variable or expression for the argument.
 Husoski: ...but I did use .rsplit(maxsplit=1) myself.
 Dren: I just used name.split('.')[-1]
 nacho.code.ar: -1?
 Dren: python lists can be indexed negatively
 Dren: to walk backwards from the end
 Husoski: Python indices wrap around: a[-1] is last entry, a[-2] is the one before that, etc.
 Dren: so [1,2,3,4][-1] == 4
 nacho.code.ar: get you
 Husoski: Can't go past -len(array) though.
 nacho.code.ar: -1 work as sweet
 nacho.code.ar: but not pass latge dataset now
 Dren: also when you are trying to look up a key that may or may not exist in your dictionary you can just use dictionary.get( 'key', default ) and if it's not in the dictionary it will just return the default
 Dren: when the large dataset fails do you get an output with mistakes or does it time out?
 nacho.code.ar: FailureProcess has timed out. This may mean that your solution is not optimized enough to handle some cases.
 Dren: yeah you have too many loops
 Dren: with nesting
 Dren: I think you should clean up the code you have now
 Dren: delete stuff you commented out, maybe add proper names to variables etc to get a better loopk at what your scrip is actually doing
 Dren: then look at what you can replace to make it faster

 DisguisedCrows: Can I ask you guys a question about OOP?

 Astrobytes: Programist_vlad: Будь ласка, говоріть англійською.
 Dima0123: начни с practice - easy
 AntiSquid: Programist_vlad go to russian channel 
 tomatoes: :grimacing:
 tomatoes: russian channel is still broken tho
 Astrobytes: Really? I thought it was OK again
 tomatoes: yes, same problem as before. no new messages until full page reload (chat reconnect)
 Astrobytes: Does CG know?
 tomatoes: hm, logs broken too. not sure if its related somehow
 Astrobytes: I would guess it probably is related
 tomatoes: don't know, i didn't report
 Astrobytes: Somebody reported before and they did something but not sure if they know it's broken again
 AntiSquid: well that sucks, hope someone from ru reports it on discord, that's where they first take note of it it seems
 jacek: reported
 tomatoes: thanks :thumbsup:
 [CG]Nick: fixed

 Astrobytes: ,
 Laminator: wow not ever forgetting that pow function in python 
 Laminator: I still could've won if that last test case didn't time out. 
 tomatoes: pow mod?
 pedrosorio: I wish there was a way to chat with other clashofcode participants
 Laminator: Yeah, I did it by hand and lost by a single char in shortest mode
 Laminator: You can in the lobby before it starts
 Laminator: and then here when you're done
 tssw: pedrosorio, there was that functionality before... I don't know why you could not chat in that room after leaving lobby&#160;:-(
 pedrosorio: it would be nice if they had the smaller chat 
 pedrosorio: just for people who did the clash
 tssw: yes&#160;:/
 proscripterlol: Share code please
 proscripterlol: I'm trying to learn
 proscripterlol:&#160;:(
 pedrosorio: shared
 pedrosorio: oof, that was slow
 pedrosorio: @tuffyTL look at that Python beauty
 pedrosorio: @dizzyramen share code?
 pedrosorio: @Izzobacul good job!
 Izzobacul: @pedrosorio nice!
 pedrosorio: 38 seconds, wow
 pedrosorio: noooooooooooooooooooo
 pedrosorio: submitted before testing all cases
 MOSTAFA: Hello why int.parse doesn't work here 
 pedrosorio: @Izzobacul well done!
 Izzobacul: hahaha yessss
 pedrosorio: 3:56, that was bad
 Izzobacul: I totally forgot how to do int formatting&#160;:((
 pedrosorio: I just used zfill
 pedrosorio: guys, it's supposed to be shortest code...
 pedrosorio: shortest code is a bit boring
 pedrosorio: 1:33 horrible
 Laminator: damn I thought 4 counts as having a circle
 pedrosorio: 0:35 that's what I'm talking about
 DaFrElUf: @pedrosorio: Boring? Do better before calling it boring.
 pedrosorio: @DaFrElUf care to share your code?
 DaFrElUf: Sure
 pedrosorio: so, I could have spent another 5 minutes to try and come up with "import math as m"
 pedrosorio: it's just not the most interesting kind of challenge for me
 pedrosorio: I prefer the fast/reverse ones
 starmaq: yes reverse ones cool
 starmaq: especially when they're quite tough
 tssw: @pedrosorio... for shortest use bash&#160;;-)
 CuttingEdge: im confused
 CuttingEdge: what are we supposed to do for this one lmao
 pedrosorio: oof, bash I once got the first prize of bash solutions in a bot competition haha
 tssw: DaFrElUf, thats nicer solution
 icecream17: Automaton2000 &gt; NN?hmm

 beginnerscripterlol: :pensive:
 rcar: I always show code
 icecream17: well, ....what are you working on?
 TheSpiffiest: That one was just how fast can you type&#160;:)
 icecream17: Here are the first three lines of my code:
 icecream17: Oops. It says "this command does not exist"
 icecream17: Hmm. It's because of the backslash character
 icecream17: *forwardslash
 icecream17: No losses, but I got a worse rank because I tied more often =/
 Laminator: Is there a way to tell who the bots are in clash of code?

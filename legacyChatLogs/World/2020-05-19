 Kellthazar:&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: The cover of the Fall Challenge seems amazing...
 Kellthazar: Robot battle, maybe?
 WINWINWIN: I dont think they have decided what the contest is going to be, looks like the cover is just a placeholder
 ZarthaxX: was the same as the pac one
 ZarthaxX: wat WINWINWIN said :P
 eulerscheZahl: that cover contains some previous contest themes. the rocket from A*Craft, the dragon from The Great Escape, Detective Picaptcha, the digging robot from Unleash the Geek
 eulerscheZahl: the racing car might be from coders strike back
 jrke: is spring challenge realesed as classic game?
 eulerscheZahl: probably today
 jrke: K
 eulerscheZahl: was planned to be live already but something came in between
 jrke: but new name for winner of contest 
 eulerscheZahl: ẞ
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?

 jrke: hey cegprakash congrats first in india
 cegprakash: Thank you!
 jrke: hey i first thought that OOC was tough but seems very easier 
 cegprakash: it's tough after Silver at least
 cegprakash: I spent lot of time to reach gold
 jrke: K
 cegprakash: and wood1 was the hardest league
 cegprakash: sorry wood2
 jrke: but i started it yesterday 10 minutes of coding gave my 2.2 ppoints lead from wood2 boss and i am in wood1 
 jrke: hey wood 2 is easy man
 cegprakash: tell from a beginner perspective
 jrke: i am now in wood 1 there is no point now if wood  2 is toughest league&#160;;)

 jrke: hey there is rule in OOC that max turns is 300 per player but i had one of 324 turns one player what can i do
 cegprakash: it's the frames
 jrke: look this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/467441700">https://www.codingame.com/replay/467441700</a>
 jrke: means we have to give max 300 outputs yeah
 eulerscheZahl: you know that you can shoot, right? :D
 cegprakash: :joy:
 cegprakash: jrke is following non violence strategy
 cegprakash: like Gandhi
 jrke: yeah
 jrke: hey i didn't did anything for wood 1 yet its my wood 2 bot ranked 259 but added silence
 jrke: hey i wanna know one thing how u shoot just random

 WINWINWIN: Is this a bug in python?
 WINWINWIN: def get_cell(self, x, y):
 WINWINWIN: this is my method
 WINWINWIN: game.grid.get_cell(j, i).set_land()
 WINWINWIN: this is the call, but it says insufficient arguments
 c0cainee: maybe they're being passsed as a tuple?
 WINWINWIN: Dont know why it would be passed as a tuple&#160;:/
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl took back general #1 thanks to contest points I suppose
 dbdr: should be even more when multi opens
 ZarthaxX: dbdreulerscheZahl 12:37AMoh, 1st againand some more cp to come with the multi
 ZarthaxX: lol
 dbdr: first I thought you were repeating me. but I see, I repeated euler :D
 ZarthaxX: yes, it was funny lol
 jrke: hey anybody can tell whats wrong in this c++
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fdc7ff9-c1cd-43b6-a56d-ee48cdaa904a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fdc7ff9-c1cd-43b6-a56d-ee48cdaa904a</a>
 WINWINWIN: string a int y
 WINWINWIN: comma missing
 jrke: comma added
 jrke: by the way i got my mistake i didn't declared using namespace std;
 jrke: thanks
 R8T3D: hey
 R8T3D: is C++ inherently disadvantaged in shortest problems?
 R8T3D: why isn't this accounted for?
 R8T3D: Python almost always dominates these type problems
 Uljahn: is Python inherently disadvantaged in AI Bot programming? C++ almost always dominates these type problems, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: no, but i can do it at the beginning of the game, but i think that might be it
 dbf: R8T3D, you are wrong, perl dominates for shortest
 eulerscheZahl: can we start a petition to disallow C++ in AI contests?
 eulerscheZahl: and i always thought it's bash for shortest
 eulerscheZahl: as CG doesn't have golfscript2
 R8T3D: @dbf semantics
 R8T3D: I just mean generally speaking
 dbdr: we could create CGscript
 R8T3D: it seems odd that shortest problems don't account that some languages are significantly more minimal than others
 R8T3D: I get it 
 R8T3D: I do
 R8T3D: Just was curious
 dbdr: the only valid program in CGscript is empty
 dbdr: the CGscript interpreter detects the puzzle from the input, and outputs the solution
 Quidome: dbdr you are on top by TAD
 Quidome: What did you add?
 dbdr: yeah, I got #1 there 15 minutes before pac2020 started :D
 WINWINWIN: I see that pacman opened as a multi, awesome!!
 dbdr: I need to check my git history to remember what I changed
 Quidome: WINWINWIN nice
 Quidome: dbdr oh, ok np
 R8T3D: #1 in what?
 Quidome: Tulips and Daisies
 R8T3D: sorry new to this whole thing
 Quidome: R8T3D welcome&#160;:)
 R8T3D: thanks :D
 dbdr: well, it's something in the evaluation function
 R8T3D: I'm traditionally a software developer but this area of competitive style programming is so intriguing to me
 dbdr: the details are a bit out of my head for some reason&#160;;)
 dbdr: I'll need to check it again, it's not even committed
 dbdr: contest started a bit too early&#160;:)
 dbdr: what will you do next Quidome?
 Quidome: I am eating all the puzzles to gain speed on my coding skills
 Quidome: still rusty
 dbdr: yes, good way to practice
 Quidome: Focussing on refactor skills and higher order functions
 Quidome: I was simply too slow in the contest
 Quidome: got 2 days to late in gold
 dbdr: one advice would be to use newtypes, if you don't already do that
 Quidome: what are newtypes?
 dbdr: you create you own types for concepts in the game
 dbdr: for instance Gold in TAD
 dbdr: it can still be represented by an int concretely
 dbdr: but it's a separate type
 Quidome: ok, i see , i am going to look into that
 dbdr: so you can't mix gold and something else by mistake
 Quidome: I use enum a lot
 dbdr: struct Gold(u16); for instance
 dbdr: enum is good too
 Quidome: But that solves a different problem I think
 dbdr: then you define the operations that make sense for your newtype
 Quidome: references is still a pain in the ass with lifetimes
 dbdr: maybe. I think it helps with refactoring for instance
 Quidome: do yoy use them at all?
 dbdr: basically you'll get more compilation errors and less eird behaviour
 dbdr: *weird
 dbdr: which is very much the spriit of rust
 dbdr: and other high level languages
 Quidome: I understand your newtype argument thnxs&#160;:)
 dbdr: references, I start to, only if few cases
 dbdr: *in few cases
 dbdr: you can even overload operations on your newtypes, e.g. arithmetic and indexing
 dbdr: like in pac2020, index a Map by a Position
 Quidome: Yeah you showed met that before, gonna look into that as well
 Quidome: very neat
 dbdr: one of the great things on rust is that you can get this high level representation in types, at compile time, and no cost for it at runtime, just as fast as primitive types
 dbdr: very fe languages have that
 dbdr: *few
 Quidome: I really like that
 Quidome: Did  a lot of Python recently but when it get's a certain size I slow down completly, not so with Rust
 dbdr: but really, the best way to improve is to practice a lot
 dbdr: there is a sweet spot: spend enough time on one multi to get a good result and learn stuff
 dbdr: but know when to stop too
 Quidome: true, the Rust Idiom is differtent though
 dbdr: you will learn more by doing something different at some point
 Quidome: true
 dbdr: you mean rust is confusing in the bginning?
 Quidome: Very confusing
 dbdr: yeah :D
 dbdr: references is the big part of that, right?
 Quidome: At some point you unerstand why something is not working but can't find a way out
 dbdr: haivng to convert primitive types was the other strange thing for me, but it's minor. and it has advantages too
 Quidome: You have to ignore references to start with, well references in structs
 dbdr: exactly
 dbdr: always, the key is to design your data structures very well
 dbdr: it's true outside of rust too
 Quidome: yeah
 Quidome: so I commited again  :)
 dbdr: there are several quotes on that, I think it's a general truth
 dbdr: for instance:
 dbdr: &gt; I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. 
 dbdr: -- Linus Torvalds
 Quidome: good quote :D
 dbdr: he's a C guy BTW
 Quidome: And a legend 
 Quidome: (a living one)
 dbdr: it's just that in most languages, if you have a bad data design, you can get around it by adding a pointer here and there
 dbdr: a bit like gotos, it's spagetthi
 dbdr:&#160;;)
 Quidome: what are you going to do?
 dbdr: another quote on same subject, for reference:
 dbdr: &gt; "Show me your [code] and conceal your [data structures], and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your [data structures], and I won't usually need your [code]; it'll be obvious.<i></i>
 Marchete: data structures and C :rofl:
 dbdr: sure. struct
 Marchete: Any string in C: "sh*t, here we go again"
 dbdr: Quidome: I want to think about opening books
 WINWINWIN: Is rust fast?
 dbdr: it's fast. essentially same as C and C++
 Quidome: opening books on which game?
 WINWINWIN: Thanks dbdr
 dbdr: it can apply on any game that always starts in the same position, for instance uTTT, Twixt, ...
 Quidome: if it will add any value depends largely on the game&#160;:)
 MSmits: what do you want to do with opening books dbdr?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: I woke up MSmits :D
 tobk: Huh, I thought they'd come up with a proper name for the multi.
 dbdr: didn't even say the Y word&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes, I heard a call from the beyond
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: oooopeeniiiing booooookd
 tobk: Does that mean from now on each new multi is called "[Season] Challenge [Year]"?
 dbdr: i guess uTTT also works
 dbdr: or OB
 MSmits: oware?
 Quidome: OB?
 dbdr: opening book
 MSmits: I've never done an opening book for oware, but I think it would be extremely effective
 Quidome: oware is sovalble
 dbdr: I will probably test it on Twixt
 MSmits: not the way it is on CG
 dbdr: does it make it harder?
 Quidome: started to work on that, but stopped half way&#160;:)
 dbdr: or just different and hasn't been done?
 MSmits: oware is only solvable with anti-loop rules
 dbdr: ah ok
 MSmits: CG doesnt have them
 MSmits: also the 200 turn limit makes things really complicated, because the turn is now part of the transposition state
 dbdr: there are no loops though
 dbdr: limited number of turns
 dbdr: just include the turn number in the state
 MSmits: but that makes it worse
 Quidome: You can do a retrograde analysis including the loop problem
 dbdr: blows up the state space though
 MSmits: Quidome how do you solve the problem of the fact that the game ends at 200
 dbdr: you can also count a loop as a draw, maybe
 MSmits: they solved it by starting from end games
 MSmits: but now suddenly every arrangement of seeds is an endgame if you can have it at turn 200
 dbdr: 200 turns means there is a finite number of states
 Quidome: Is it a draw at 200?
 MSmits: yeah, but that means exactly nothing
 dbdr: so you can learn back from that. of course it's too bug in practice
 MSmits: no its not quidome
 MSmits: most seeds gathered
 dbdr: too big
 Quidome: aha 
 dbdr: I'm ont convinved it makes it unsolvable, but does make it harder for sure
 dbdr: *not
 MSmits: I think this makes oware practically unsolvable, but if you already have a good bot and you write a meta mcts, you could make it way stronger than anything that is on the board now
 dbdr: yeah, lots of multis can be improved significantly
 MSmits: dbdr I am not 100% certain about it, but you also cant claim for certain it is solvable given earlier solvable versions of oware
 MSmits: it's up in the air
 dbdr: I guess CSB and uTTT are the ones that have been explored the most at the top, right?
 dbdr: by many top players
 MSmits: I did a LOT of work on yavalath. Even if it is just me, it has been explored a lot
 MSmits: almost as much as uttt
 dbdr: right, but if it's only one/few players, it's more likely there is more to be discovered
 MSmits: sure, thats possible
 dbdr: regardless of who did it
 dbdr: also it's harder for you to improve without a strong opposition, no?
 dbdr: or you just improve against yourself?
 MSmits: well the opposition is very strong in yavalath I think, but yes mostly with meta mcts vs myself
 MSmits: there are some strong players on there
 MSmits: tric trac, dafish, renard, robo did a NN, darkhorse and pb4 did a good bot as well
 dbdr: I see trictr*c is close
 MSmits: they all spent much time
 dbdr: ok, then it has been explored well
 dbdr: those are strong players indeed
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: uttt is another level entirely though
 MSmits: so many players
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: Fantastic Bits can probably be improved on a lot
 dbdr: of course new strong players will arise
 dbdr: yes pb4. similar to csb, but much less worked on
 cegprakash: hey pb4 did u see my forum post
 pb4: I did cegprakash, did it call for an answer&#160;?
 dbdr: but really true for most multis
 MSmits: btw... dbdr did you see our discussion about opening books last night?
 cegprakash: pb4 you did the new ranking system?
 dbdr: I didn't MSmits, slept early&#160;;)
 dbdr: I will check it, thanks!
 pb4: I did my own ranking yes, though it's nothing official
 cegprakash: who built the match making? Why didn't I get any matches
 MSmits: ah, 3 of the 4 guys that have a deep opening book in uttt all online at once, discussing them
 cegprakash: against rank 40-50
 pb4: I think there is some margin on Vindinium too
 darkhorse64: dbdr: re your linus quote, one interestingthing is that, in French, as you know, a computer is called an "ordinateur". French sees the computer not as a calculus engine but as a means to organize data
 MSmits: karl iso changed his and took nr 2
 MSmits: nr 1 sry
 MSmits: made me nr 2 :P
 dbdr: darkhorse64 very good point!
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: well they are both valid names. A main feature of a computer is also doing computations fast 
 pb4: my current Vindinium code is only short term planning, there are many games where it is clear that some sort of longer term planning would help
 dbdr: sure. you could say computation is the how, but data is the why
 MSmits: the game has run before on a different platform hasnt it pb4?
 MSmits: are our bots on par with those?
 dbdr: e.g. MCTS, lots of computation, at the end what you want is a few bits of data&#160;:)
 MSmits: sure
 darkhorse64: I always see my programs as a data flow and design my code to avoid turbulence. That way, it is faster
 dbdr: and the tree is interesting too, and it's all data
 Insufficient: hey guys, fyi the multi version of pacman is now out it seems
 dbdr: sounds great dashu_baba
 dbdr: darkhorse64, sry
 MSmits: Insufficient cool, more cp&#160;:)
 pb4: MSmits&#160;: yes, different platform. We can't know how our bots compare to that other platform because nobody ported their code.
 Insufficient: it will be interesting to see now everybody has seen what other people did if anyone can optimize further and how much tougher the competition gets
 pb4: euler had made a message on that other platform's reddit, no success
 MSmits: ah no... but I wonder if they have guides and stuff that tell you how complicated their bots arre
 MSmits: planning and such
 pb4: They do
 darkhorse64: Shall i rest or avenge myself from failing for making it to Legend&#160;?
 dbdr: avenge!
 pb4: Doesn't seem like there was anything magic in their codes
 MSmits: or let yourself be drawn back into uttt :P
 darkhorse64: Legend under 300 lines of C++
 dbdr: 5 people computing in pac2020
 dbdr: including... guess it!&#160;;)
 pb4: I would expect mine to be on par with their "state of the art" back then
 MSmits: 300 lines of c++&#160;? I can't do a sim in 300 lines :P
 pb4: I start contests with more than 300 lines of templates...
 MSmits: allright pb4, good to know
 MSmits: I'm sure I will go back to it at some point
 MSmits: I gave it up because I had no idea how to do it
 MSmits: mostly because i suck with minimax&#160;:)
 pb4: Then bring the MCTS magic :D
 MSmits: yeah, that would maybe be even harder in this case, i tried smitsi with no luck
 MSmits: the 4p thing is hard&#160;:(
 MSmits: but i'll figure something out in the end. First there is uttt and i want to try breakthrough
 MSmits: twixt is on my list as well
 MSmits: plenty to do
 pb4: I'm still stuck on BR
 MSmits: the NN. 
 pb4: Yes
 pb4: I've been torturing NN for a long time on BR now
 pb4: They just won't learn...
 MSmits: I am thinking to do a thesis on teaching machine learning in highschool CS
 MSmits: I have to do one for my studies
 MSmits: to become CS teacher
 pb4: thesis = phd&#160;?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: not sure what the name is
 MSmits: its just a big written thing
 MSmits: with research in it
 MSmits: design educational material
 MSmits: test it out
 MSmits: conclusions etc.
 MSmits: i can use existing material too ofc
 MSmits: like the tensorflow stuff
 MSmits: doesnt have to be generalized either, it may just apply to my local school situation
 MSmits: anyway, it seemed like a great excuse to get into machine learning, been putting that off
 pb4: haha
 pb4: Will it be machine learning applied to games&#160;?
 MSmits: could be, sure
 MSmits: it's really broad
 MSmits: it's one of the optional parts of the CS curriculum in my country
 MSmits: you have to choose some optional parts
 MSmits: I can choose what to do
 pb4: If you want to link this with CG, remember I made a database of "game state" --" "good action" for CSB
 pb4: Can be used for supervised learning, to imitate a basic bot
 MSmits: sounds cool, but might be a bit out of range
 MSmits: they're not that far into coding, most of them. I think I could get about half of them to finish some easy puzzles when they get to the point wed be doing this
 pb4: Not that much actually&#160;: doesn't require a CSB simulation engine, doesn't really require much
 MSmits: to give an estimate at how good they are
 pb4: oh
 pb4: right then :D
 MSmits: there are always some students massively ahead of the rest
 MSmits: like my student that got into silver last contest
 pb4: Is it really the right time to get them into machine learning&#160;?
 wlesavo: &gt;"game state" --" "good action" for CSBpb4 may i have a link 
 MSmits: well they put it in the curriculum so it has to be doable&#160;?
 pb4: forum --&gt; search "neural network resources"
 wlesavo: oh, thx
 MSmits: we do a lot more coding than most schools teaching CS
 pb4: Though "good action" is really not that good compared to today's standards :D
 MSmits: if we cant do machine learning, noone can :P
 pb4: It was the output of my contest bot
 MSmits: pb4 this is a training database like a mnist set for numbers?
 pb4: Yes
 MSmits: thats really cool
 pb4: 100k datapoints if I recall correctly
 pb4: Trained my first NN on that database using Excel's optimizer function :D
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: talk about inefficient...
 MSmits: excel&#160;:)
 pb4: I was afraid to code at that time...
 MSmits: I do it all the time though, but I dont know so many tools
 MSmits: afraid to code?
 pb4: It was my 2nd contest on CG if I recall correctly
 pb4: I only learned to code on CG
 MSmits: hmm not sure if it is the same for me
 MSmits: I learned to code bots on CG
 pb4: So I only knew C++, and was pretty bad at it
 MSmits: I already wrote some mods for games in C# before
 Illedan: Link to that DB of "good moves" pb4?
 MSmits: real 1-2k line mods, not little changes
 pb4: Same as wlesavo, it's on the forum
 MSmits: pb4 you made this database not for NN purposes at first I guess? If it was during an early contest?
 MSmits: just to test a ga or something against?
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/neural-network-ressources/1667/6?u=pb4">https://forum.codingame.com/t/neural-network-ressources/1667/6?u=pb4</a>
 pb4: It was right after the contest, the objective was to try training a NN with supervised learning
 MSmits: oh, you got into it really early then...
 Illedan: Do you explain what the input variables are?
 pb4: Yes Illedan it's in the data file
 pb4: the first 35 lines are """"""documentation"""""""
 pb4: Yes I use a lot of quotes, it's not exactly proper documentation :D
 Illedan: #Blind -.-
 MSmits: sometimes i see a gith repository, with 1 or 2 lines of code, some blank lines, lines with comments, then another 1 or 2 lines of code, then more comments
 MSmits: I always found that completely horrible
 pb4: Better documentation&#160;: 
 pb4: I created 100k random situations where&#160;:
 pb4: the pod is placed in (0,0)
 pb4: The next checkpoint is placed in (D,0)   on the X axis
 pb4: pod has a random speed
 pb4: random direction
 MSmits: oh its a runner database
 pb4: Yes
 MSmits: well thats the most important part and easiest to train for 
 MSmits: to at least get a bot goint that is
 pb4: next_next checkpoint is placed randomly
 MSmits: going
 pb4: The pieces of code in the """""documentation"""""" shows how this situation is encoded
 Illedan: I will create an Optimization puzzle of running 1 pod for 3 laps. To test NN on 1 runner only&#160;:)
 MSmits: with the SDK, for real?
 Illedan: yeah
 MSmits: thats cool
 Illedan: Give me 2 days
 MSmits: Take your time&#160;:)
 MSmits: a -18, 0, 18 split of angles is not gonna give good results there
 MSmits: not like it does on the multi
 Illedan: Ofc not, but I want to see how good NN can do :D
 MSmits: yeah
 Illedan: And removing all other obstacles
 Illedan: To see it actually working
 pb4: In a runner-only situation, the best we found with Agade was a code by BleuJ
 pb4: simulated annealing with depth 20 I think
 kovi: yep
 MSmits: nice
 kovi: that is the usual method on such problems
 pb4: This would finish races on average 3 frames before our best bots
 pb4: Though I have to admit it's been a long time since I tried seriously to make a runner-only for CSB
 MSmits: GA wont do better than SA?
 wlesavo: SA was so good for me in NS
 wlesavo: couldnt make GA work even though tryed hard for it
 kovi: SA is beast. winner solution for 50% of topcoder marathons 
 Illedan: Combination worked very good on NumberBash
 MSmits: hmm what kind of algorithms for the other 50%?
 MSmits: your app Illedan?
 Illedan: Eulers game
 Illedan: I used SA + GA
 MSmits: yes but you made an app and called it numberbash didnt you?
 Illedan: sure, but didn't publish yet
 MSmits: ah ok
 Nerchio: Saelyos won pacman yea?
 dbdr: Illedan do you have a stack of unfinished projects? :D
 dbdr: now runner CSB got on the top of the stack
 kovi: beamsearch. but i like those were heuristics needed
 MSmits: ah ok
 wlesavo: Illedan wow, i would read the details if you dont mind sharing
 Clagus: Nerchio - it seems so, he is currently no1<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard</a>
 Illedan: dbdr, sure  ;) But I always had NN for CSB on the stack
 dbdr: just reorder the stack
 Illedan: But last time I tried, my pod was driving in circles... Closer and closer to the CP :P 
 dbdr: hm, reminds me of CGFudge
 dbdr: is that where it is?
 Clagus: Nerchio - but top 20 shifted so much after the competition end, it's amazing... I think maybe because they already opened it for multiplayer outside competition?
 Nerchio: ys
 Nerchio: yes
 wlesavo: Clagus many didnot resubmit
 Clagus: but on my screenshot just after competition ended Saelyos is still no1 so
 Clagus: wlesavo - what do you mean? Legend league was recalculated by CG
 dbdr: no need for screenshot, the contest leaderboard is there, frozen forever&#160;:)
 Illedan: \o/ Finally we can see the history of our contest codes :D
 Nerchio: the crossroads thing is cool from pacman strategy
 dbdr: it's in the multi?
 Clagus: dbdr - just wanted to be sure&#160;;)
 Illedan: yes
 dbdr: nice!
 wlesavo: i mean in multi, i climbed 30 ranks in legend by not resubmitting
 dbdr: I have 103 submits in the pac2020 multi
 Clagus: wlesa
 dbdr: yeah, well done CG!
 dbdr: i meant yay! 
 wlesavo: did val missed the main part or he after the end?
 Clagus: wlesavo but they recalculated whole legend league, so even if you didn't resubmit, it just resubmited itself with the same code
 wlesavo: or he improved
 MSmits: recalc is not resubmit
 dbdr: it even does not have a submit for the multi opening, which is good
 wlesavo: Clagus no they did not
 MSmits: resubmit starts at the bottom, recalc starts at last position
 Clagus: MSmits how so?
 MSmits: big difference
 dbdr: well spotted Illedan
 Clagus: oh, ok, didn't know that
 MSmits: it should not matter but it does
 dbdr: it does not matter with infinite matches&#160;;)
 MSmits: you'll be able to shift form your last position but not very much
 dbdr: otherwise, I had to matter
 MSmits: right dbdr
 MSmits: euler did a test 
 dbdr: it has to
 MSmits: he broke his bot on botg so that it ended at the bottom and had  atimed switch to turn back on for recalc
 MSmits: his bot was around 40 rank, for recalc it was near 100 i think and it came back up to 73, hope I have the numbers right
 WINWINWIN: Why was that needed?
 MSmits: to test how well the recalc estimates rank
 MSmits: he wanted to know if it could get him back to 40
 dbdr: that's sad. but that's also a worrst case scenario, being so far from your real rank
 dbdr: I think he crippled it a lot, no?
 dbdr: timeout on x% of the matches on purpose
 MSmits: to get to the bottom yes
 dbdr: would be useful to know what was x too
 dbdr: but not 100%, or was it?
 MSmits: I am not sure if it was&#160;%
 MSmits: maybe he timed out all
 dbdr: that's covered by x = 100%&#160;;)
 kovi: but how do you know that his original position was the real one?
 MSmits: yes lol
 dbdr: but I think I remember it was not all
 kovi: he shoudl have smurfed
 MSmits: kovi, in some games you will know, pacman is a bad example
 MSmits: in csb for example
 MSmits: you know your real rank
 dbdr: smurfed in legend, that's doubly bad
 kovi: i know
 kovi: msmits: true. some games have must less randomness (more stable ranking)
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: it's nice when that happens
 dbdr: resubmitting my bot on pac2020, to see if it ranks similarlythen I will test the 2 improvements I did yesterday
 MSmits: but it's more important for a game to be fun and interesting to code
 kovi: dbdr - too few games
 kovi: this is a bad multi
 dbdr: kovi from one submit you mean?
 kovi: well...with submit spam, probably any of top20 could end up top3
 MSmits: btw dbdr I again added you to a cg bench list and marvelled as i beat you 100% until i realized.... rust :P
 dbdr: I know, one data point is just better than 0. I don't need a high precision right now
 MSmits: during pacman that is
 dbdr: especially as my changes are better tracking, it would be strange if it hurt
 dbdr: MSmits lol and&#160;;(
 kovi: dbdr, yeah im doing the same. first data point shows, that anotjer wouldnt gave me top3 either
 kovi: another hour of work
 dbdr: well, I won 4/10 with my final submission :D
 dbdr: let's see if it still climbs
 dbdr: even lost once against Illedan, sth is not right&#160;;)
 dbdr: I noticed several times, being stuck near the bottom, then start winning and zip through the middle and quickly get to top 30-ish
 dbdr: I think lower bots are more random (since less good)
 MSmits: same for me... it was really sluggish to get through bottom
 MSmits: if i hadnt resubmitted when i did  1/2 hr before deadline, i would have started at 83 instead of 40
 dbdr: makes sense if you think about it
 Nerchio: MSmits i like your summary of pac challenge some great ideas in there
 MSmits: thanks Nerchio
 dbdr: the worst bot is a purely random bot (unless you try hard to be bad)
 jrke: why i am getting this as error stream
 jrke: double free or corruption (out)
 jrke: c++
 dbdr: the theoreticall best bot plays the optimal strategy, which is deterministic
 dbdr: actual bots are somewhere on that line
 WINWINWIN: I wonder how far you can get in a multi by printing random commands :thinking:
 MSmits: this is the most interesting thing about opening books
 MSmits: the better your opponent the better they work dbdr
 MSmits: they become more deterministic
 WINWINWIN: Like in BotG where it gets till Bronze
 dbdr: yeah, I think we are syaing the same thing MSmits
 MSmits: sometimes there are multiple optimal strategies though
 Illedan: Keep pushing me up yes
 MSmits: for instance, if uttt can be theortically solved as a win for p1, then there will likely be many ways to do this
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: so yes, the specific move mught change
 dbdr: but you would win 100% of the time
 WINWINWIN: Cant games with no random factor like UTTT be precomputed?
 MSmits: right
 dbdr: so the result is deterministic&#160;:)
 MSmits: WINWINWIN the space is too large, but from a certain point into the game they can
 wlesavo: WINWINWIN do it
 MSmits: which is why opening books are vulnerable
 dbdr: WINWINWIN yes for small games, like non-ultimate tictactoe&#160;:)
 dbdr: even some mid-sized games
 dbdr: checkers is solved AFAIK, using optimizations
 MSmits: brb have to go get daughter from school
 WINWINWIN: But in Tic Tac Toe there is a distinct advantage to the guy who starts, he has no chance of losing
 JBM: checkers, connect-4
 JBM: won't they leave us anything?!
 WINWINWIN: is there anything like that in UTTT?
 MSmits: man i dont want to go... now it gets interesting
 MSmits: yes there is WINWINWIN, but i tmay still be solvable to draw
 MSmits: p1 has about 70% win
 MSmits: with regular bots
 MSmits: anyway ttyl&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Bye MSmits
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 jrke: double free or corruption (out)
 jrke: i am getting this as error stream c++
 jrke: how to fix it plz
 dbdr: JBM you can always use the 'ultimate' transformation
 JBM: does that work with any game?
 dbdr: can work with many at least
 dbdr: I feel it can be formalized
 JBM: does it make them undecidable, or just harder to?
 dbdr: exponentially harder
 dbdr: all games are solvable by minimax, no?
 JBM: yeah, they're still finite known state, so same rules of solving
 JBM: exactly
 dbdr: I guess it can get interesting with inifinite branching factor&#160;;)
 JBM: well "public state equal rights alternating turns" games anyway
 dbdr: you can solved unequal rights too, no?
 WINWINWIN: Doesnt Ghost in the cell have a near infinite branching?
 dbdr: anything you can represent as a dag
 JBM: ah yes
 JBM: i had mentally replaced minmax with "just solve the tree"
 dbdr: single player too, it's just a special case where you always play
 dbdr: aka optim
 dbdr: maxmax
 JBM: yup
 JBM: minmax is really not the right term here
 JBM: it's just search
 dbdr: yeah, minmax is not the exact term
 dbdr: search with an arbitrary +1 and -1 multiplying factor at each state
 dbdr: +1 or -1
 dbdr: that handles all 1 and 2 player cases I think
 JBM: which you can see to see either as part of the graph or as part of the alg
 dbdr: yes, but data &gt; code, if you read above&#160;;)
 JBM: this can be read both ways
 JBM: "is better than"
 JBM: or "is larger than"
 dbdr: better
 dbdr: more important
 dbdr: code is a detail of how to generate the data
 JBM: but is generated data really data?
 JBM: oh dear i'm getting philosophical again
 dbdr: well, like minimax is an abstract concept (which happens to have a corresponding obvious implementation)
 dbdr: the minmax value of a state is data
 JBM: all right
 Csipcsirip: there were a recalc in the multi or what&#160;? 
 dbdr: regardless of how you compute it
 dbdr: Csipcsirip no, started in the same state as the final contest
 dbdr: then people started to submit, as usual
 Csipcsirip: ahh okay so some1 pushed me up
 JBM: well done
 dbdr: JBM shall we not go into the fact that code IS data?&#160;;)
 JBM: Not Today
 dbdr: allright, allright
 JBM: XD
 dbdr: reminds me of some game from Wales
 JBM: a game of drones?
 dbdr: at the end, all that matters is values (e.g. data)
 dbdr: Kaamelott reference
 JBM: errr i'm kind of missing a few links here
 JBM: oh That game
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 JBM: comes twice in the series if i'm not mistaken
 dbdr: there are several games. does this one come twice?
 JBM: hard to prove they're the same
 dbdr: this one is Le Sirop (sirup)
 JBM: youtubing now
 AbdelkrimBournane: WHATSAPP! 
 JBM: no wait actually i think i'v got them on the other hard drive
 JBM: the search experience is going to be bettter
 4candles: Hi all. Beginner programmer (learning Python) here.  My friends list is very empty *sob* Are there any other python beginners out there want to hang out/learn together?
 Adnmaster: im not a beginner but im still learning
 Adnmaster: how about me?
 Adnmaster: im looking for friends too
 Adnmaster: why is the chat suddenly so still? :D
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 Uljahn: why do you even need specific friends to learn python? all python community seems extremely friendly to me
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 Adnmaster: are you saying to me or him?
 jrke: hey winwinwin
 AdrienA: yes python community is great
 jrke: how u used torpedos
 WINWINWIN: Full tracking system
 WINWINWIN: took nearly 500 lines in python to do it too
 4candles: Adnmaster sure, let me add you :slight_smile:
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: do you have discord? We can talk there too
 Adnmaster: Colorhacker#8394
 jrke: K
 4candles: I can install it. Supposed to be working, but not much work going on :wink: trying to learn programmign instead so I can get a more interesting job.
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: nice
 Adnmaster: i can teach you
 4candles: Awesome thank you
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: no problem
 Adnmaster: we can talk at the private message place on codingame or on discord
 jrke: can anybody draft contest
 SujalAI: Can someone tell me why my pacs freeze after turn 70
 SujalAI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/467559329">https://www.codingame.com/replay/467559329</a>
 SujalAI: I'm just finding the closest pellet out of all the pellets
 Uljahn: click three dots on the lower right
 dbf: SujalAI, because opponent uses speed and you don't
 Adnmaster: because you don't have any pellets in sight in frame 70 SujalAI
 Uljahn: nah, that's not the case, he just printing the same target
 Uljahn: @dbf
 Uljahn: Adnmaster: could be it
 dbf: ah, ok
 SujalAI: Adnmaster but the super pellets an be seen from anywhere and also I have an array of all the pellets in the map
 Adnmaster: hmm...
 Adnmaster: wait
 Adnmaster: you are right...
 Adnmaster: check if there is a bug in your code
 SujalAI: This the code to get all the pellets in the map
 SujalAI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/986143d1-b621-4fa2-81c5-e5ba0821715c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/986143d1-b621-4fa2-81c5-e5ba0821715c</a>
 SujalAI: I consider everything other than a wall as a pellet
 SujalAI: And I delete the pellets which are in the same location as a pac
 Adnmaster: wait
 Adnmaster: no that will be error
 SujalAI: why?
 Adnmaster: you have to reset all the pellets every round, and then give them in the list every round
 Adnmaster: you cant delete them manually
 Adnmaster: you can, but that will give error
 Adnmaster: instead try to get the updated locations of pellets every round
 Adnmaster: if you get the updated statement of pellets every round, it will keep searching for it
 Adnmaster: plus it is more simple than deleting them manually
 Adnmaster: thats my suggestion, but you can do it how you want
 SujalAI: The problem is that I can't get the map every single turn, it's  a one time thing
 SujalAI: It only comes on initialization
 Adnmaster: you don't need the map every turn, it gives you the locations of the pellets
 SujalAI: But only the pellets which are in sight
 Adnmaster: yeah, i can't help you futher
 SujalAI: I want all the pellets in the map
 Adnmaster: in which league are you?
 SujalAI: bronze
 Adnmaster: rank?
 SujalAI: 1473
 SujalAI: in bronze
 SujalAI: overall rank is 3500 something
 Adnmaster: with the pellets in sight code i got into 700th
 Adnmaster: perhaps you can try that
 SujalAI: The problem is some of my pacs go for the same pellet when I do that
 SujalAI: That causes endless collisions
 Adnmaster: i made a code that if there is collision they go to another direction and ignore the pellet that causes collision
 Adnmaster: you can do that
 SujalAI: How can I make them go another direction?
 SujalAI: Oh I can just ignore the pellet if it's chosen by some other pac
 Adnmaster: for example you can make another list, if they are colliding you will put the pellets location you want to ignore in that list, and you can delete the locations from the list of pellets every round
 SujalAI: Ok thank you
 Adnmaster: no problem
 Adnmaster: by the way i figured out why you're code has bugs
 Adnmaster: you can only see the enemy pacs in sight
 Adnmaster: so the enemies you don't see will eat the pellets but you wouldn't have deleted it because you couldn't see the enemy pac
 SujalAI: I know about that bug but I just ignored it
 SujalAI: But I just realized  2 problems with my logic
 Adnmaster: what is it?
 SujalAI: If there are no pellets in sight then My pac freezes
 Adnmaster: hmm...
 Sonex123: i do not understand this
 Adnmaster: yeah i can't help any further :sweat_smile:
 Adnmaster: a little bit hard
 MSmits: SujalAI I have a property "possible pellet". Any place that has a "possible pellet" will be  a possible target for my pac
 SujalAI: And there's a problem with my defense, I only switch if an enemy is near but if I'm under cooldown then I just die
 MSmits: any time you see a cell is empty, you will forever set the "possible pellet" to dalse
 MSmits: false
 Adnmaster: you can avoid the enemies if they are near and you are under cooldown
 MSmits: so at the start all pellets are alive and only as soon as you see one, does it get flagged as being gone
 Adnmaster: same defense i did :sweat:smile:
 MSmits: then it doesnt matter if your pac doesnt see any pellets
 Adnmaster: wait
 SujalAI: Is the possible pellet a property of the pellet or the pac
 MSmits: pellet
 MSmits: I have an array with all cells on the board
 SujalAI: This replay shows both problems with my logic:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467564094">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467564094</a>
 MSmits: it just has cell.possiblePellet = true
 MSmits: at the start
 MSmits: except for the walls and the places where pacs start
 SujalAI: K
 SujalAI: How do you find out if the cell is empty?
 MSmits: you see it
 MSmits: update every turn.. all visible cells
 SujalAI: But you can only get all visible pellets not cells
 MSmits: you know where they are
 MSmits: so just set the right cell.possiblePellet to false
 MSmits: the cells have coordinates too
 MSmits: maybe do a 2D array with cells or a 1D array if you're comfortable with the 2d -&gt; 1d conversion
 SujalAI: So I should make a 2d array of all cells
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: thats a good way to do it
 SujalAI: Then I should set possible pellet to false if my pac is on that cell
 MSmits: your pac does not need to be involved
 MSmits: you get a list of all visible cells each turn
 MSmits: no matter where your pac is
 SujalAI: Then how do i know if a cell is empty
 SujalAI: I do
 MSmits: it gives you the value
 MSmits: if it is 0 it is empty
 SujalAI: What?
 SujalAI: Can you send me a snippet of that code
 MSmits: its in the description, read that
 MSmits: Next line: one integer visiblePelletCount for the amount of pellets visible to youNext visiblePelletCount lines: three integers:x &amp; y: the pellet's positionvalue: the pellet's score value
 SujalAI: I don't get all visible cells only all visible pellets
 MSmits: thats the same thing
 MSmits: a pellet is on a cell...
 MSmits: and you get x and y coordinates for the pellet
 MSmits: the cell will have those same coordinates
 SujalAI: So the value can be 0
 MSmits: you can find the cell in the array and set the property
 MSmits: yes, then the pellet is gone
 Sonex123: has someone an idea?
 SujalAI: I didn't know about value 0 thing
 MSmits: oh hmm, i might be wrong here
 MSmits: sorry
 MSmits: no it only gives visible pellets that are up sorry. Let me show you something else 
 MSmits: (i wrote this code early contest sec)
 MSmits: this is a part of a function that sets all cells to visible
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92289e81-ba8a-4592-84e3-dc9b342d96dd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92289e81-ba8a-4592-84e3-dc9b342d96dd</a>
 MSmits: and here i set possible pellets to false when i should be seeing them
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9f1f7f7-3b20-4bb9-8ed3-b85369423b81">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9f1f7f7-3b20-4bb9-8ed3-b85369423b81</a>
 MSmits: all cells will have their pellets set to 0 at the start of a turn and set to 1 or 10 when its updated to be in the list
 MSmits: then if i should be seeing a pellet, but i am not seeing it, pelletpossible is set to fale
 MSmits: false
 MSmits: so a visible cell that does not have a pellet in the update information, will have its property set to false
 MSmits: the visible cells function just goes in each direction until it hits a wall
 MSmits: from each pac
 MSmits: so yeah... i mislead you to think it was simple, it's a bit more complicated, sorry about that
 MSmits: btw the "it" in the visible cells function just counts how many times it went left (or right) because otherwise you will be going on infinitely long... some corridors go across the entire map and you can go on forever
 MSmits: infinite vision
 MSmits: hope this helps
 jacek: so close <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467575121">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467575121</a>
 jacek:  think i have some draw bug
 struct: Im wasting so much time on the move generator i though i had it figured it out&#160;:/
 struct: All this because I want to give legal moves
 dbdr: struct personally I never use the legal moves from the referee
 struct: Yeah me neither, but some people might find it usefull to see if their move generator is correct
 dbdr: but those people are advanced users, they can figure it out
 dbdr: however it could be useful for an easy depth 1 search
 dbdr: that's nice for beginners
 struct: I guess im just rusty
 dbdr: rusty is good&#160;;)
 dbdr: are the rules complex?
 struct: Not really, but you can do multiple moves per turn
 dbdr: yeah, that complexifies things
 struct: My old  version add 1 action per turn, but you could have multiple turns in a row
 struct: That is not ideal
 dbdr: interesting twist&#160;:)
 dbdr: does the sdk even support that?
 struct: yes
 dbdr: nice
 dbdr: but then you would get 50ms several times?
 struct: yeah&#160;:/
 dbdr: that could be interesting: you could make your first move, without knowing yet what your next one would be
 dbdr: don't have to of course, but you would possibly get an advantage if you pull that off
 struct: true, I might have to increase time a bit though for this multi
 struct: 50ms might not be much
 dbdr: cannot the list of all possible multi-moves blow up exponentially?
 struct: Can be quite big I think
 struct: I dont know the exact number
 struct: I will find out today hopefully
 struct: I can even add an option if you want move generator or not
 struct: so it wont slow you down
 dbdr: yes, that would be good
 dbdr: also avoid wasting CG server ressources

 struct: Im back to it yes
 Doju: Hey, do you guys think it's worth it to rewrite my 1000 lines of python to learn?
 Uljahn: to learn how to rewrite and refactor?
 cegprakash: calibration playing a huge role in leaderboard
 cegprakash: this should be chaged
 cegprakash: changed*
 struct: Whats your suggestion?
 cegprakash: instead of giving 100% games to those within +- points
 cegprakash: give 50% in this range
 cegprakash: 40% in a lil bit far
 cegprakash: 10% in more far
 Doju: Uljahn yes, exactly
 cegprakash: especially in legend when I skip the bottom 20 I easily get to rank 30-50
 cegprakash: and I have a win rate around 55%
 Doju: and find things that could've been done in a smarter way
 cegprakash: and stay there
 struct: I dont think that will fix much
 struct: So what if a player at rank 90 wins a match against you when you are at rank 10
 struct: How much will you fall down
 struct: how much will he climb?
 tobk: great, NOW my pac bot decides to have a winning streak... :rolling_eyes:
 WINWINWIN: cegprakash, should it be something for only legend or all leauges
 WINWINWIN: because other leagues are considerably large
 dbdr: struct the answer to your question is that TrueSkill decides that&#160;:)
 dbdr: it's an open question what the matchmaking should be, indeed
 dbdr: cegprakash my bot behaves similarly
 dbdr: but I also think it should be possible to improve it so it wins more consistently against lower players, even if not always
 dbdr: the quick fix is: if your first 10 is too bad, resubmit&#160;:)
 cegprakash: can't do that in legend dbdr
 cegprakash: to win first 10 is rare especially in close and invisible information and completely random maps 
 dbdr: I'm not saying 10/10
 struct: you shouldnt win the 10 if your bot ranks halfway through legend
 struct: That is a lucky submit
 dbdr: if you win 7/10 in average, resubmit if you get 4/10
 cegprakash: I always get 4-5
 cegprakash: getting 8+ is rare
 dbdr: then your bot has weaknesses
 struct: ^
 struct: Im sure if he rank 1 submits he will get 8/10 a lot
 dbdr: so either improve it. or resubmit when you get 2 instead of 4-5&#160;:)
 cegprakash: don't blame my bot
 cegprakash: if the leaderboard gives 2 different rank too apart
 cegprakash: then the leaderboard is bugged
 ntroPi: is submitting broken at the moment? Not getting the matches in progremss&#160;% and not changing rank at all right now.
 dbdr: no
 struct: ...
 dbdr: it's easier to blame the leaderboard, I know&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: After one year and a half here, my experience is that if my bot is good, it  climbs the ladder and stays on top, otherwise it fails. Don't complain, write a better bot
 dbdr: ^
 struct: Sure your bot might get a better rank in 1/100 times
 struct: But that doesnt mean your bot deserves that rank
 darkhorse64: The result of a lucky submit is invariably a slow decay
 darkhorse64: or not so slow
 dbdr: it's true you can have a quite strong bot with big weaknesses, so the results are confusing
 dbdr: a trivial example would be having rare timeouts, or be really bad on certain kinds of maps
 dbdr: and strong otherwise
 dbdr: then the leaderboard will look random to you
 dbdr: more than it really is
 dbdr: darkhorse64 not entirely, e.g. if only low-rank bots play some strategy, and you don't handle that well
 dbdr: once you climbed above it, it won't matter
 struct: Yeah, that can happen, in some mutlies this is not a problem, but in some can be quite hard to manage
 cegprakash: ntroPi yes leaderboard is hanged
 ntroPi:&#160;:-(
 dbdr: leagues help with this, but of course not anymore with low legend
 cegprakash: my submit is completed but stuck at 7% and non rank updated
 cegprakash: but u can guess ur rank using a chrome extensionnn
 cegprakash: install CG spunk chrome extension and click on last battles. It'll show u rank of all opponents u have recently faced
 cegprakash: that'll give u an idea about ur rannk ntroPi
 ntroPi: sounds interesting, my last battles is empty though.
 cegprakash: dbdr I easily climbed 40 ranks in a resubmit
 cegprakash: should this happen on legend?
 cegprakash: if this is normal then leaderboard is right
 cegprakash: otherwise leaderboard is bugged
 dbdr: yes, if you play well against some low ranks and not against others
 dbdr: or on some kinds of maps and not others
 cegprakash: I have 55% win rate against everyone
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/cegprakash">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/cegprakash</a>
 darkhorse64: dbdr: This is quite true. My OOC bot times out against spam silencers; I choose deliberaltely not to fix it because I felt it was not a winning strategy and that high level bots would not use it. But it is my choice not the leaderboard fault
 struct: ceg I see 36% 23&#160;%
 cegprakash: do u think my rannk is fair consnideringn I was top 60 before rerunn
 cegprakash: very funny struct
 dbdr: you'ill get roughly 55% whatever your bot strength is
 struct: Its the truth
 cegprakash: 2 guys decide my rank when there are 113 ppl in nleaderboard?
 cegprakash: that's very funny
 dbdr: if you are stronger, you will just climb and play against stronger bots
 struct: "I have 55% win rate against everyone"
 dbdr: still with about 55% wins
 dbdr: 55% avergae is what he means
 darkhorse64: You have a much lower win rate against ppl ranked above you. That means the leaderboard is right
 dbdr: funilly, I have 54% wins average
 dbdr: this means nothing
 cegprakash: I've 100% win rate againsnt Gafagarion in ur way of calculation if only 1 or 2 guys is what that matters
 cegprakash: and 100% against  Xanrum
 cegprakash: how can u let those guys above me when they have 0% againnst me
 darkhorse64: Quoting one figure is pointless. Onyy the average against people above you matters
 cegprakash: that's what I'm also saying
 dbdr: btw, cegprakash, your cgstats is for the contest not the multi
 cegprakash: I'm talking about the contest rannking only
 dbdr: oh ok
 cegprakash: both uses same leaderboard logic
 cegprakash: my bot still gives 2 diff ranks 40 ranks apart in ndiff submissions
 darkhorse64: The problem is that you look only at your wins and not your losses
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: why does it only look at my loss and not the guy above me's losses
 darkhorse64: You are much more biased than the lb
 cegprakash: I've 100% win rate against them
 dbdr: against handpicked opponents
 dbdr: it's bound to happen
 dbdr: number of matches against a specific opponent is always going to be low anyways
 cegprakash: just look at this guy's games
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/Gafagarion">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/Gafagarion</a>
 dbdr: so it's meaninglss by itself
 cegprakash: do u think I should rank lower than him?
 eulerscheZahl: i arrived just to see me at 7th in the contest now&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: Look also at your losses and and also consider that that they have wins against other players that contribute to their rankings
 dbdr: cegprakash yes
 cegprakash: then u are biased
 cegprakash: just like the leaderboard
 darkhorse64: The overall ranking is not the result of your own battles
 dbdr: you're ignoring that by being ranked higher, he also played against stronger players
 dbdr: you can't compare winning rates because of that
 cegprakash: that's the exact point I don't understand
 cegprakash: why didn't I play with higher raks
 cegprakash: that's what I'm asking
 dbdr: you might also randomly play more against lower or higher ranks
 dbdr: but TS accounts for that
 cegprakash: crap
 dbdr: a win ratio does not
 cegprakash: it should be equally random
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 cegprakash: getting matches against lower bots makes nno sese
 dbdr: :D
 cegprakash: I win them anyway
 dbdr: it does, in case you are overranked
 cegprakash: wtf I'm underranked
 dbdr: you win 100% against lower ranks?
 dbdr: not you personally
 cegprakash: I've 55
 cegprakash: nobody has 100
 dbdr: that 55% is meaningless
 dbdr: either trust the ranking, or understand how it works before criticizing it
 darkhorse64: :popcorn: 
 cegprakash: it gives diff. rank for diff submits.. 5-10 ranks diff is acceptable
 cegprakash: 40 ranks 
 cegprakash: not acceptable
 cegprakash: leaderboard sucks
 Astrobytes: :salt:
 darkhorse64: :sugar:
 dbdr: going into :popcorn: mode too&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: where is my salt shaker
 struct: How many times are you ranked 40 ranks higher?
 eulerscheZahl: on discord
 struct: 1 in 50 submits?
 cegprakash: like 10 times
 cegprakash: 10 in 50
 dbdr: not abnormal
 cegprakash: it is 
 Snef: You could maybe have always the same rank if there was 100* more game played in submit
 cegprakash: leaderboard with full of bugs
 dbdr: lol
 cegprakash: Snef no
 cegprakash: my rank is always based onn first 10 games
 cegprakash: wherever I caliberate I stay there
 cegprakash: because I've 55% against everybody
 cegprakash: apart from top 30
 Astrobytes: The solution to a better &amp; more stable rank is simple ceg - git gud
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: nevertheless cegprakash is #1 rank in our hearts :purple_heart:
 Automaton2000: why don't you try to make a decent bot
 Astrobytes: ^hahahha
 Hjax: LOL
 struct: :fire:
 WINWINWIN: Quite mean Automaton2000
 Hjax: Automaton2000 throwing shade 
 darkhorse64: to the point
 Automaton2000: u can do it fast
 Automaton2000: i might give it a try
 WINWINWIN: Ohh its a chatbot
 WINWINWIN: my bad
 dbdr: Automaton2000 won the match :D
 Astrobytes: Awesome work there Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you do it when i have to see the rules
 Automaton2000: what are you on about
 cegprakash: A day will come
 eulerscheZahl: Automaton2000 is the better bot compared to AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the most recent contest?
 Automaton2000: is it more like a sorcerer conjuring a powerful demon hamster lol
 cegprakash: when u cry about ur rankings
 cegprakash: just like me
 Snef: AutomatonNN did you miss it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Demon hamster?! WTF :D
 cegprakash: may be then u'll understad
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by that?
 eulerscheZahl: but the most sneaky boss making most new users believe he's real is MadKnight
 eulerscheZahl: boss =&gt; bot
 MadKnight: impossible
 JBM: the endgame bot
 WINWINWIN: they are surprisingle coherent
 JBM: hurt me plenty
 WINWINWIN: &amp;surprisingly
 Astrobytes: not always WINWINWIN
 dbdr: I'd like a MadKnight boss
 Astrobytes: NN speaks gibberish mostly
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, 2000 is good?
 Astrobytes: Much better, yes
 WINWINWIN: NN --&gt; Neural Network chatbot?
 Snef: 2000 is markov chain
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr my ping triggered the MK bot, yours didn't :D
 dbdr: gg
 Bestpart: Why I can't play clash of code
 Snef: Bestpart because you have first to do multis
 Astrobytes: :P
 WINWINWIN: I dont think there is a limit Bestpart
 Snef: like csb, ask MadKnight to help you
 MadKnight: okay i see
 WINWINWIN: Probably slow net
 <b>**MadKnight quits</b></p><p><img src="/a/41508827498835" /> CyberWind: ^_^
 eulerscheZahl: Bestpart did you play a lot recently?
 Bestpart: today I play 1
 eulerscheZahl: then there will be captchas. I know Chiniese uses have problems with those. You are not Chinese but close&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: but 1 clash doesn't trigger a captcha
 Astrobytes: There's been a couple of site errors the past hour, and people are complaining about leaderboards stalling too - could be a site issue
 dbdr: "not chinese but close" might be culturally sensitive :D
 dbdr: or insensitive
 eulerscheZahl: i got a network error on mouseover to see struct's new profile pic
 Joniboy2: is coding clash dwn?
 Joniboy2: down*
 eulerscheZahl: it seems so
 StepBack13: yeah, I got 504'd
 AlexanderPuchta: i think so, clashes dont start
 StepBack13:&#160;:(
 Joniboy2: shit
 StepBack13: I should have won last clash, but my submission got 504'd.&#160;:((
 AlexanderPuchta: shit happens
 AlexanderPuchta: brazzer
 <b>**dbdr suddenly realizes how many clashers lurk on the chat</b></p><p><img src="/a/41508827498835" /> CyberWind: is CoC getting experience?

 AlexanderPuchta: have seen it for the first time yesterday at CodingGarden Stream. really nice thing this codingame
 eulerscheZahl: too bad: you missed the contest
 eulerscheZahl: ended just yesterday

 cegprakash: none of them deserve to be at a better ranking than me
 cegprakash: clearly bugged leaderboard
 struct: Yeah
 struct: bugged
 cegprakash: it's easy to say fix ur bot when the leaderboard is bugged
 cegprakash: to avoid the blame
 struct: This is why I play CoC
 struct: that prooves who is the best
 struct: None of these shenanigans
 cegprakash: struct CoC proves who is the fastest not who's the best
 Hjax: fastest is a measure of best 
 eulerscheZahl: first of all: let's have a look at all the data. CGstats shows 243 games, where there are about 1000 for each user
 Hjax: maybe not the /best/ measure of best, but certainly /a/ measure 
 cegprakash: everyone skipped me
 cegprakash: that's the point
 cegprakash: I'm worried
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/6FyWSYRm">https://pastebin.com/6FyWSYRm</a>
 Hjax: perhaps they had better results earlier in the calibration 
 eulerscheZahl: let's consider this when we talk about your rank cegprakash
 struct: is this from him?
 cegprakash: only 64 games?
 struct: or yours?
 cegprakash: okay 64 opponents
 cegprakash: ofc I didn't have more matches againsnt top guys
 cegprakash: stats clearly says that
 eulerscheZahl: that's all the recalc matches. search for your nick
 cegprakash: which is unfnair
 eulerscheZahl: because your performance vs the lower ranked players didn't justify to give your those
 cegprakash: there should be an upper limit of games against a certain player
 cegprakash: at least something like 15 games
 cegprakash: having 40 games against same player is useless
 jrke: hey i wanna know how wood 1 boss of OOC can predict us as i am even not using torpedo and didn't used surface also
 cegprakash: I could have used those remaining 25 games against other players
 jrke: and boss also didn't used sonar
 cegprakash: justify?
 Snef: jrke he knows the moves you did from the start so he can compute where you could have started
 cegprakash: like 70% win rate?
 jrke: K
 cegprakash: 51% or 70% anything &gt; 50 is a win
 Hjax: jrke probably just sliding around possible positions and removing the illegal ones each frame 
 Hjax: oops scroll 
 eulerscheZahl: raise your concerns there: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://maplecity.com/homepage/guest1.html">http://maplecity.com/homepage/guest1.html</a>
 Hjax: chat should have a red *new messages* popup when you are scrolled up and typing
 Joniboy2: is clash up again?
 YumYmu: hi!
 struct: ceg have you tried bug-report on discord?
 eulerscheZahl: i like my message board link more. was curious if i can do an SQL injection on it, got a 403 instead&#160;:(
 NickStahl: You don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/guestBook.pl on this server.
 NickStahl: Last post of '19.... So guess it's dead
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl, I tried the same thing :P
 eulerscheZahl: then let's try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://demo.123guestbook.com/">https://demo.123guestbook.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: your message will be shown as soon as the webmaster approved it
 eulerscheZahl: why did I write SQL injection up there? I meant XSS
 Astrobytes: Well, neither worked :P
 eulerscheZahl: so both are great places for ceg to complain
 NickStahl: :D
 struct: I think submit should start at rank 1
 struct: This will fix everything /s
 eulerscheZahl: i should be able to decide where i start
 eulerscheZahl: and end
 darkhorse64: I should be able to rank myself
 Astrobytes: Submit-&gt;Select Final Rank-&gt;Profit.
 eulerscheZahl: that could be a premium user feature
 eulerscheZahl: and a non-laggy chat
 Astrobytes: In fact, don't even bother with the contest. Fastest to select the highest rank wins.
 darkhorse64: The problem is between the computer and the chair&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: =&gt; less game development time, contests more often
 NickStahl: yes!
 Astrobytes: Very much so :D
 struct: My pseudo recursive move generator is working
 eulerscheZahl: yinsh?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: great
 eulerscheZahl: smits will be happy
 NickStahl: Astrobytes, last person to select best rank wins. That way it will stay exciting!
 Astrobytes: Great point NickStahl :D
 eulerscheZahl: like the last user to git push winspush -f&#160;:)
 NickStahl: And you can smurf by selecting lower ranks :S
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Astrobytes: We're definitely on to something here. Should keep ceg happy enough :P
 eulerscheZahl: did we troll him away already? so quiet
 struct: It is easier to complain than it is to improve
 struct: Sure the leaderboard is not perfect
 Astrobytes: Perhaps he's attempting to log a complaint on one of those websites
 NickStahl: You guys use GIT?Kid: "Mom can we have version control?"Mom: "No we have version control at home"Version control at home: "CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,
 eulerscheZahl: there is some randomness. but not as much as others imply. ceg at 83 now
 eulerscheZahl: which is better than his contest rank but still far from top50
 struct: Yes, that might be due to random maps
 struct: or a bug in the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: a strong bot can consistently reach top10 from my observations of others submitting
 Doju: Erm
 Doju: how do you guys have bfs implemented?
 Astrobytes: In code.
 Doju: i need it in different situations
 eulerscheZahl: i can share the code now, give me a sec to trim it
 Doju: but copy pasting is the root of all evil
 NickStahl: Astrobytes you beat me to it :D
 Astrobytes: :P
 Doju: eulerscheZahl no it works just fine but
 struct: ofc, and there are plenty of multies that if rank 1 submits he will still be rank 1
 Doju: do you have like one thing that yields a cell at a time then you do whatever with it?
 Astrobytes: Could you be a little more specific?
 Doju: So currently i have 3 or 4 places with almost exactly the same flood fill code
 Doju: except one returns when it hits a specific target cell
 Doju: one maps distances to all visited cells
 struct: rank 1 in tron is a deleted account&#160;:(
 Doju: one builds paths
 Doju: and one flags dead ends
 eulerscheZahl: won't compile as i deleted some parts but didn't clean it up properly
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/04c14e5b-db57-46cb-8cea-3fb8c1eaae6a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/04c14e5b-db57-46cb-8cea-3fb8c1eaae6a</a>
 NickStahl: What I was wondering eulerscheZahl... Is this private int[,] BFSDist; faster than Dictionary&lt;int,int&gt; when you need to look for a specific value?
 NickStahl: What I did was translate all x/y values to a cellId, and put all cellId's with their distance in a Dictionary&lt;int,int&gt;...
 Doju: So you only have one that goes to one target? eulerscheZahl
 NickStahl: Guess I should just test it instead of asking&#160;:)
 NickStahl: Damn CG chat, too distracting&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Chat can be very useful at times&#160;;)
 Csipcsirip: my beautiful c++ implementetion with some global variables to be read first

 eulerscheZahl: dictionary has some overhead over a plain array
 Doju: So, do you have similar code for flagging dead ends for example?
 Astrobytes: I use an optimised version similar to the last one on Smit's BFS optim article
 NickStahl: Astro yeah, chat is great and keeps me from working&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: Csipcsirip did you break your bot?
 Doju: Thanks btw eulerscheZahl, Csipcsirip
 eulerscheZahl: you are right below ceg
 NickStahl: Csipcsirip what is it with C++ devs and short var names?
 Astrobytes: Clearly a LB bug
 struct: ^
 reCurse: Hey hey not all c++ devs
 Csipcsirip: no I'm too a victim of the unrealistis ranking system 
 reCurse: You're looking for C devs
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: some competitive programmers write really ugly codeFOR(i, n)i hate that #define to allow this
 Astrobytes: Yes. 100% yes.
 reCurse: But it's the right tool for the job
 reCurse: They created their own DSL to be as fast as possible
 reCurse: Nothing wrong with that
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: u missed my stream during contest right
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjN2tNt8i9U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjN2tNt8i9U</a> 
 eulerscheZahl: i know. i just don't like the optics :P
 cegprakash: I've put it on youtube
 reCurse: It's not meant to be used in codebases :P
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't miss it. i ignored it
 eulerscheZahl: was busy coding myself
 cegprakash: that's what I meant by missing
 cegprakash: missing is nice
 cegprakash: ignore is harsh
 Astrobytes: "i ignored it" :fire:
 reCurse: Maybe he just doesn't like your stream
 reCurse: Nothing wrong with that
 cegprakash: this time I read the problem statement
 reCurse: Fake news
 cegprakash: seriously who reads problem statement for pacman
 cegprakash: I did only for u guys
 eulerscheZahl: don't take it personal. i ignore other streamers too. e.g. never watched illedan for more than 5min
 cegprakash: I know you man
 cegprakash: reCurse see
 cegprakash: ppl love me and my stream just that they don't get anything useful from it
 Astrobytes: I remember I was watching more than 5 minutes of this stream by... I believe it was reCurse, but then... nothing? :P
 cegprakash: I mean eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: noobies can like my stream
 eulerscheZahl: and wasn't as hyped by reCurse storing the board state in a bitstream. don't get me wrong: it's a cool way to compact it. but not the reinvention of coding as others think
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm not talking about the er Bit Stream :P
 reCurse: I still don't understand why it's such a hit
 cegprakash: spring challenge leaderboard now shows I'm 86th
 cegprakash: with same code
 Astrobytes: Come on, BitStream == InstaWin
 cegprakash: 86th is a nice rank compared to 106
 cegprakash: now that's satisfying
 cegprakash: come on 3 digit rank sucks
 struct: ...
 reCurse: I layer ranks as 2^n
 reCurse: Same n so same result
 Astrobytes: Maybe you should have your own league ceg, you can choose who to battle and you'll always be happy&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you can do that: create your own private contribution
 eulerscheZahl: and only share with those you can beat
 cegprakash: okay I go back to work damn CG is so distracting to my work
 reCurse: :wave:
 cegprakash: boss gonnna fire me
 Astrobytes: See ceg, victory can be yours

 eulerscheZahl: waste of speed turns
 Astrobytes: "transform into one of the gouchokipars"
 reCurse: I think we need another game where more time is spent figuring out what's going on than coding AI
 eulerscheZahl: i hate for of war
 eulerscheZahl: fog
 Astrobytes: What, like RAIC with a 100 page problem statement/manual?
 reCurse: No, I think we need a multi version of the codingame challenge
 reCurse: That would be the apogee of everything CG
 reCurse: No viewer, no statement, just a binary result win/lose
 Astrobytes: Absolutely no clue given. Just "here you go"
 reCurse: The ultimate incomplete information game
 Astrobytes: That would certainly be a fitting end to this run of incomplete info contests. 'The WTF Quadrilogy'
 reCurse: OOC is fine because that what the point of the entire game
 ike-fite: Im confused about the robot challenge 
 reCurse: PAC though looked like torture
 reCurse: At least in top legend
 Astrobytes: I didn't play it much but regular pacman would have been more fun I think
 eulerscheZahl: i struggled to motivate myself writing a tracker
 eulerscheZahl: same for UTG
 NickStahl: If they changed it so that a PAC could look diagonal as well, would that fix it?
 eulerscheZahl: for both my tracker is incomplete
 eulerscheZahl: just no fog of war. game has enough complexity without
 reCurse: They just need to change it so all information is given and something that leaves a bit more room than collect X &gt; Y
 NickStahl: I mean, still incomplete info, but no corner kills anymore (unless you take a risk), right?
 reCurse: So redesign the whole thing :P
 kovi: i think maybe resurrection could helped lower the randomness
 Astrobytes: Well, since we're not allowed to have that other pacman multi, perhaps someone could make something similar with a better twist that FOW
 Astrobytes: *than
 reCurse: The pellets are buried under the ground and you need a radar to find them
 Astrobytes: fffs :D
 reCurse: Wait :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: and where do i store them once collected?
 reCurse: You just eat them
 reCurse: That's the twist
 Astrobytes: Or hide them in the centre of the map to troll the opponent. They'll never know.
 Astrobytes: Call it SquirrelMan
 reCurse: So if the pacs stuff too many of them they get stuck in the walls
 Astrobytes: Nice. Obesity avoidance game.
 reCurse: Don't call it that
 reCurse: Next thing someone will yell fat shaming
 kovi: and they can choose getting eaten now, or eat more pellets and got stuck later
 Astrobytes: lol true
 Astrobytes: Healthy SquirrelMan
 Astrobytes: *Healthy SquirrelEntity
 reCurse: What about PETA?
 reCurse: You forgot about PETA.
 Astrobytes: Dammit Karen

 Doju: Oh yup i had some terrible constants in my final submit
 eulerscheZahl: while coding i was wondering several times: pacmans or pacmen?
 reCurse: Are you assuming its gender
 ike-fite: i just noticed it i was afk for minute
 eulerscheZahl: there is a "man" in the name
 Astrobytes: Well, they told us they were men, so I guess it's safe
 reCurse: So a manual is for guys?
 struct: there is man in woman euler
 eulerscheZahl: and 40 years ago game designers weren't that overly correct
 reCurse: Alright where's my offensive checklist
 Astrobytes: GenderNeutralual
 reCurse: I think I'm almost done
 reCurse: Haha just kidding not even halfway through
 Astrobytes: Everything offends somebody somewhere
 ike-fite: ur not wrong
 Astrobytes: Rather, somebody somewhere will be offended by something. Probably something you would never even think of.
 eulerscheZahl: prof told about a colleague who had to rename a chapter in order to publish his book. from travelling salesman problem to salesperson
 Astrobytes: :facepalm:
 kovi: amen
 reCurse: And the world was made a better place that day
 Astrobytes: There are enough real issues rather than wasting time on such complete and utter nonsense.
 reCurse: Those are real issues
 ike-fite: This is the reason i dont like world chats. 
 ike-fite: Stuff comes out of nowhere
 Astrobytes: lol, I apologise for the offence caused reCurse
 Astrobytes: :P
 kovi: real issue is to dfs or bfs...or dbf-s?
 reCurse: dfs and bfs have equal rights
 eulerscheZahl: but shall I use PascalCase or snake_case?
 Astrobytes: Yes, don't be so directionalist, or dimensionalist either come to think of it.
 eulerscheZahl: and is kovi insulted when i dislike Hungarian notation?
 ike-fite: so about the robot challange does your robot have to be balanced. Or can it be OP
 AntiSquid: i see real pacmen when i go shopping, no wonder there are no pellets on the road
 Astrobytes: I am triggered by Hungarian notation eulerscheZahl.

 reCurse: Incomplete information prevents simulation guys
 AntiSquid: what about the people who don't get to legend because they don't even try as hard as they should? i think they deserve most attention :p
 reCurse: Breaking news
 ike-fite: Did I Ask lol
 reCurse: "seeing a game that was not fully dominated by simulations, giving a chance for the less-capable coder was a relief"
 reCurse: Did he even read the thread?
 Astrobytes: So, all future contests should have twice as many inputs as Code Royale, asymmetry, be completely random and have little-to-no relevant information. And a 1 ms time limit. That should keep them happy eh.

 struct: let me read it
 Astrobytes: "Those games had became mostly a feast of search algorithims, instead of favoring heuristics, logic and implementation of some kind of AI" dot dot dot
 Illedan: Flip again.
 reCurse: Absolutely no heuristic, logic or implementation in my CSB
 reCurse: It's all brute force
 struct: "We will never create a true AI just testing every possible solution."
 Astrobytes: I mean seriously
 reCurse: ezpz
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/LH-i8IvYIcg?t=59">https://youtu.be/LH-i8IvYIcg?t=59</a> ike-fite
 eulerscheZahl: we should guide him to RAIC where the game is so utterly complicated and convoluted that writing a sim is no fun
 ike-fite: im on a school chormebook so i cant rn
 AntiSquid: but you still need a sim lol
 reCurse: Well PAC wasn't dominated by search and sim
 reCurse: So at that point...
 Illedan: Beam search is not a search?
 Illedan: hmm
 reCurse: Yeah I know
 reCurse: TIL
 BeardedWhale: While that is obviously stupid nonsense, I do for real think having a contest without simulations is an interesting idea, if done correctly (e.g. by severly limiting calculation time).
 reCurse: People keep fantasizing about that
 jrke: thanks struct&#160;:)
 reCurse: I don't understand why
 Astrobytes: Don't be searchist reCurse
 reCurse: And what it would even look like
 Illedan: Even at 10 ms you can do some simulations..
 struct: I think the solution is to have a simulation contest, but only D is allowed
 reCurse: Because it would be a true test of intelligence?
 eulerscheZahl: will just favor C++ as you don't have garbage collection peaks
 reCurse: There's so much fallacy IMO
 eulerscheZahl: and D of course
 Astrobytes: Yes. D only. 0.1ms time limit.
 Snef: What is it with D&#160;?
 reCurse: You're programming a glorified calculator
 eulerscheZahl: on hacker.org there was a game that is basically Tron (but long before CG did it)
 AntiSquid: what if you have most stuff precomputed and stored in arrays or whaytever BeardedWhale&#160;? 
 struct: So we should write a contest based on if a language can do well on it or no?
 kovi: or a game where you gain resource by answering fast
 eulerscheZahl: and you had to code it in java with a runner making sure that you don't exceed 10k instructions per action
 kovi: i actually like the idea
 reCurse: CG's framework prevents that kind of dynamic
 Astrobytes: Snef, since the D Brigade flooded CG forum with requests for D and all it's amazing benefits, it's become something of a CG meme. Especially since none of them are actively here using it.
 Snef: Oh i see
 reCurse: But yeah I'd like frame-based games
 reCurse: Just not possible on CG
 Astrobytes: And it's 3.14 * 10^42 faster than C++ Snef&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: hey it's a nice language imo, but those guys are really full of bullshit, they basically said they are going to be active on CG if it's added
 reCurse: Still completely orthogonal to the whole "simulation is the devil" axis
 JBM: some game where you have to parse the entities from the view on your own
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-what-programming-language-would-you-like-codingame-to-support-next/99904">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-what-programming-language-would-you-like-codingame-to-support-next/99904</a>that's the origin of the D meme here
 JBM: more real life IA
 JBM: *AI
 JBM: where shooting isn't a once per turn thing, it's more like "start pulling trigger"
 reCurse: I also don't understand the entire argument of "this game is more friendly to less capable coders, therefore I have more of a chance"
 reCurse:&#160;??????
 reCurse: Is this the basis of the "simulation is bad" camp?
 AntiSquid: and the characters have a speech bubbles and you need to do sentiment analysis to decide whether or not you're supposed to shoot at them&#160;!
 JBM: with little lily and her quantum physics book
 Astrobytes: On the whole "I'm a noob, searching is unfair and stupid thing": When I first started on CG I knew next to nothing about any of that, I muddled my way through Code Royale then immediately set about trying to learn search methods and whatnot. It was (is) an exciting challenge
 reCurse: Do the skills of the better coders magically disappear? Or they were stupid to begin with because all they did was brute force brrr
 kovi: maybe more enjoyeable experiencebeen there when i was lazy to (full) sim
 kovi: like in raic&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: but you have the random aim there 
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't fully sim last RAIC?
 kovi: well, in the end almost full
 ike-fite: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/api/authorize?client_id=70445916555639423&amp;permissions252992&amp;scope=bot">https://discord.com/api/authorize?client_id=70445916555639423&amp;permissions252992&amp;scope=bot</a>
 kovi: but not in pacman
 eulerscheZahl: ah. i don't sim collisions for pacman
 ike-fite: Ive been working on this
 eulerscheZahl: just try to avoid them. and not even that is well implemented as i didn't feel like it
 ike-fite: not trying to spam or anything
 reCurse: Not clicking on a link that says "authorize" with unknown ids
 AntiSquid: looks dodgy indeed
 kovi: (and of course i lost on meanmax without proper collisition)
 AntiSquid: ike-fite it's too risky to keep you unbanned, AutomatonNN execute
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same?
 eulerscheZahl: for meanmax my first day was copy-pasting the referee and hitting compile until there were no more erros
 ike-fite: i typed it out so its most likely wrong
 eulerscheZahl: errors
 AntiSquid: what did you link ike-fite&#160;?
 ike-fite: bot
 ike-fite: discord 
 ike-fite: 1 sec
 AntiSquid: that's not how you link a bot
 AntiSquid: not for discord
 ike-fite: its worked before like 3 times
 Csipcsirip: is it possible to just copy paste the pacman referee and comment out the fog thing and publish it as a new multi&#160;?
 AntiSquid: normally they're on sites like this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://top.gg/">https://top.gg/</a>
 ike-fite: tbh im not to high of a level on this account anyway
 Astrobytes: lol Csipcsirip, I think CG might have something to say about that
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl your same bot is now 4th?
 AntiSquid: your point being ike-fite&#160;?
 reCurse: I don't see why not
 eulerscheZahl: pushed up a bit Marchete.but i think it's stronger than the 14th place it got in the contest
 Astrobytes: It's that LB bug again eulerscheZahl
 Csipcsirip: yes I'm afraid too CG guys would take it as an insult
 AntiSquid: your brother also got pushed
 eulerscheZahl: we should really report that leaderboard bug
 reCurse: It's already been reported no?
 eulerscheZahl: i mean ceg is clearly higher than his actual rank. so other players like me have to go down to allow this to him
 eulerscheZahl: reCurse you missed that chat. we are trolling
 Astrobytes: Absolutely.
 reCurse: Oh.
 eulerscheZahl: here's a short version <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/39?u=eulerschezahl">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/39?u=eulerschezahl</a>
 struct: You missed it
 reCurse: That's enough internet for me today
 eulerscheZahl: ValGrowth just shared his port mortem
 Csipcsirip: yay my grid-UCB algorithm is working. 
 struct: "My bot was fine tuned to beat better bots and not weaker bots"
 AntiSquid: he used chokudai search&#160;!!! 
 reCurse: CG's version of elo hell
 eulerscheZahl: in case you are reading this: thanks for taking the effort to write this in English
 AntiSquid: surely all native english speakers should pay reparations to the rest of the world
 MSmits: hi
 NickStahl: hoi
 MSmits: what did you do to tick recurse off
 Astrobytes: Showed him cegs "PM"
 MSmits: ow
 eulerscheZahl: quote ceg and a guy who hates simulations and therefor liked the contest
 MSmits: did he write a separate PM or  just the message that his rank was too low to be fair?
 Astrobytes: Just that
 reCurse: The PM thread gave me a headache
 eulerscheZahl: just the unfair leaderboard
 MSmits: most people dont even know what it means when they say they dont like simulations
 reCurse: True AI is if/else
 Astrobytes: And moaned about it in chat for a couple of hours (on and off)
 reCurse: Feels like it should fit a "haha brute force go brr" meme
 eulerscheZahl: they don't like to take the effort and learn these superior concepts
 MSmits: any time you calculate what happens with y if you do x, you already simulate
 AntiSquid: well the randomness might make it feel unfair so ...
 MSmits: if you dont like that, then you're in the wrong place here
 AntiSquid: i am happy i won the ranking lottery sort of
 MSmits: the randomness is a different issue
 MSmits: i meant simulation
 MSmits: everyone with any kind of bot that goes beyond bronze simulates
 reCurse: Reminds me of the whole "I'd be so good at starcraft but the whole twitch apm thing holds me back"
 MSmits: even if they dont know they're doing it
 reCurse: Nice meme
 Astrobytes: lol, that's actually a thing reCurse? SMH
 reCurse: I heard this so many times
 reCurse: It's definitely a thing
 Astrobytes: Jeez
 reCurse: Think it's CG's version
 eulerscheZahl: SMH? shaking my head?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, or smacking my head
 MSmits: I think when people complain about not being able to  "simulate" they mostly mean they dont know how to write/adapt a search algorithm
 Astrobytes: Shaking in this case
 reCurse: He's also implying it's better not to
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, and don't want to learn either, clearly
 AntiSquid: shaving my head
 MSmits: ah... well he's not forced to&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: As all search methods are stupid, and not True AI™
 AntiSquid: he did mean AGI by that no?
 MSmits: really
 MSmits: does he mean general AI&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i think so
 MSmits: does he want his CG to also be able to trade the stock market?
 MSmits: his CG AI
 eulerscheZahl: i think he doesn't know in detail what this even stands for
 kovi: actually ceg has a pointbesides the randomness in this contest, meta is different in certain rankranges
 kovi: slightly different
 MSmits: yes, randomness is an issue and it sometimes causes some unfairness
 AntiSquid: definitely true for gold kovi
 eulerscheZahl: legend too
 MSmits: my jump from 83-&gt; 33 for example
 kovi: i dont comment on fairness, just the observation itself
 AntiSquid: but mainly because of the somewhat more random bots in mid gold, if you managed to skip those then you get higher rank :p
 eulerscheZahl: i resubmitted sometimes to climb faster and skip the lower region
 reCurse: His point is symmetric
 eulerscheZahl: 117 entries in my submit history
 reCurse: Should he be higher ranked because he beats higher ranked bots, or lower ranked because he gets beta by lower ranked bots
 reCurse: Or *maybe* it's exactly where he should be
 MSmits: kovi ah ok... I think we just have to accept that there are games that have this issue of leaderboard randomness. You can try to solve some randomness that is inherend to the leaderboard system, but with pacman most of it was inherent to the game, not the leaderboard system
 AntiSquid: there's no precise ranking anyway
 MSmits: exactly
 AntiSquid: i mean for pacman
 MSmits: yea
 kovi: yeah
 kovi: btw, even with the randomness, top3 seemed totally valid
 MSmits: i like to use the top csb as an example of how well the leaderboard *can* work if the game has a clear difference between bot strength
 MSmits: 2 and 3 were switched with pb4s ranking kovi
 MSmits: but 1 was clear winner
 dbdr: good point reCurse about symmetry
 kovi: i dont meant perfect, just pretty good
 MSmits: yeah the top was ok, the randomness increased dramatically as you went down
 Gonny: didn't 1 and 2 become 3 and 4  though?
 MSmits: the thing is though, I was rank 33 at best and I could still beat the top guys with some percentage
 MSmits: in other games, someone 10 ranks above you always beats you (like csb)
 eulerscheZahl: and pb got a similar order at the top with a different method:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54f7fba0-ebcf-4740-b7f1-6f02c75737b7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54f7fba0-ebcf-4740-b7f1-6f02c75737b7</a>
 kovi: well, the whole point is to make 2^n ranking, what recurse mentioned&#160;:)
 JBM: reminds me of the ping pong scene in les bronzes
 Csipcsirip: yeah payers in mid legend tended to go for uncertain kills. as my bot wasnt too avare of the opponent it could easily land in there
 eulerscheZahl: of course we can debate if his method is correct or the opponent selection as a total
 dbdr: JBM got a link?
 JBM: mmm
 Gonny: damn Kovi stop resubmiting you're pushing me down! :D
 JBM: one that works for you or for me?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl the definition of "best bot" is not even that clear
 MSmits: are you best when your bot is best at beating the top 3 other bots?
 MSmits: or does it have to reliably beat everyone below that also
 eulerscheZahl: i know what you mean.let's define 3 bots R P and S
 dbdr: one issue is, people keep looking at their rank, while it's only an artifact
 eulerscheZahl: R beats S, S beats P, P beats R
 eulerscheZahl: who's the best?
 MSmits: the rating is more accurate you mean dbdr?
 Gonny: clearly P, it's before R and S in the lexicographic order!
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl yes that is also an issue
 AntiSquid: i think dbdr is saying the true rank is in your heart
 reCurse: If there are 20 R bots, 30 P bots and 40 S bots, the best bot is obviously R
 MSmits: i remember in XR, when Jolindien and I werent submitting, i was often pushed back to nr 1 again, because the only differences between our bots was that he could beat me 65%
 MSmits: so whomever is submitting makes a difference
 dbdr: only the (TS) score has some value
 dbdr: it's the same issue as giving a number from an experiment without giving hte confidence interval
 dbdr: meaningless
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh hey I can now break my code without it meaning anything
 dbdr: this actually points to an issue with matchmaking: it should use TS scores, not ranks
 reCurse: It has its own pitfalls
 reCurse: The best method is a mix of both
 dbdr: yes?
 reCurse: Yeah in Halite 3, the #1 guy was so far ahead he'd barely get any matches
 MSmits: ahh yes
 reCurse: So you'd need to stomp the top 5 to start playing vs him
 reCurse: Very annoying
 dbdr: ah, so halite does that?
 reCurse: Yeah, with its own issues
 dbdr: interesting
 reCurse: They'd sample the gaussian distribution of TS
 reCurse: Or something like that
 dbdr: true, you could get into a silly state where nobody gets matches against you, so you never climb down :D
 reCurse: Nah the bug was a bit more complicated
 reCurse: Anyway
 reCurse: Point remains
 dbdr: ah, with that there's always a probability, but could be very small
 kovi: didnt know that about halite (was too far from top)
 MSmits: will there be more halite?
 reCurse: There's "sort of" halite on kaggle
 MSmits: but you dont like that right?
 reCurse: But it's barely anything like it used to be
 Astrobytes: Is it ML only, since it's on Kaggle?
 reCurse: The platform is bad
 reCurse: IMO
 kovi: but i was also thinking about here how certain players (including me) got pushed to clear solo top and remain there till resubmit
 MSmits: whats bad about it reCurse
 reCurse: Python only and like 8 games max per day IIRC
 Astrobytes: Ew
 MSmits: ah thats sad
 kovi: that is bad
 struct: oh god
 kovi: worse than raic
 MSmits: though for games that you can simulate off line with not too much of a meta, it could be ok
 reCurse: The halite platform itself is in stasis for an undefined amount of time
 reCurse: In other words halite is dead
 AntiSquid: i forgot how exactly the platform is but, weren't you able to train offline and submit a file with predictions&#160;? so you could use any language offline?
 AntiSquid: i just remember the jupyter like editor
 reCurse: I'm not sure I get your question
 AntiSquid: talking about the kaggle website
 reCurse: Oh
 reCurse: You train a model offline and submit it
 reCurse: Then it gets temporarily tested against validators
 AntiSquid: just the results i think
 reCurse: Then the final run is done with a hidden set
 reCurse: A bit like A*C did actually
 reCurse: Nah needs to be the model
 reCurse: Wouldn't work otherwise
 AntiSquid: oh so python only indeed
 dbdr: MSmits, I decided to build an OB for TTT
 dbdr: not the ultimate&#160;:)
 JBM: OB?
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: what is the purpose of this btw?
 AntiSquid: isn't that already available&#160;?
 struct: opening book
 JBM: oh right
 JBM: thx
 MSmits: i joined when you were already talking about it dbdr, not sure what the goal of it was
 reCurse: Not an opening book as much as the solution for TTT
 dbdr: of course it's just a test
 dbdr: ttt can be solved in 5 minutes by writing a trivial minimax, even alpha beta is not needed
 MSmits: yes, but why, do you want to learn how to automatically generate them with meta mcts?
 dbdr: yes, a general technique
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: there's your opening book: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/832/">https://xkcd.com/832/</a>
 reCurse: It's a lot of compute for a boring problem
 reCurse: Randomized starts ftw
 MSmits: most of my meta mcts also have a solver, if you do an opening book like that with my meta mcts technique, you would get 1 visit
 dbdr: I remember a long time ago,  you mentioned using TTT as a way to test an MCTS
 dbdr: very good advice I think
 dbdr: the solution is known and trivial
 MSmits: yes, without a solver though&#160;:)
 dbdr: this is the same idea for OB
 MSmits: for plain mcts it's fine
 MSmits: good way to test OB too I think
 dbdr: I also plan to test it with a depth 1 greedy player
 dbdr: a way to test the OB does not include moves that are not needed
 MSmits: btw, if you write a minimax that goes 5 deep, you already solved uttt. There are no strategies that go deeper
 dbdr: of course
 MSmits: with depth 4, my bot would still sometimes make a mistake
 MSmits: with TTT that is
 dbdr: it's just a unit test, basically
 MSmits: works
 MSmits: also, meta mcts is quite slow, so you can run it for a quite a while and still get sensible data
 dbdr: right now my depth 0 player looses 100% :D
 MSmits: but your rollout games will be super fast so I dunno
 dbdr: I need to add the learning
 dbdr: I just layed down the architecture
 MSmits: a uttt game in my meta mcts is between 1 and 3 seconds
 dbdr: and you played millions of them?
 eulerscheZahl: did i miss the moment of reCurse opening the UTTT leaderboard?
 MSmits: i had a run that went to 1.8M
 MSmits: my current one is at 1.4M
 dbdr: 500 hours of CPU
 MSmits: sure, that seems right
 MSmits: just 1 core
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: i have it running in the background whenever my computer is on
 dbdr: enjoying the noise of the fan?&#160;;)
 MSmits: not evne really because i want to win, i like seeing what happens, how the value of moves change and such, somehow its fun for me :P
 dbdr: yes, sounds captivating
 MSmits: i always have 1 game running
 MSmits: a few months ago i stopped running yavalath, i can always resume that one
 dbdr: which one is now?
 MSmits: uttt
 MSmits: I already fixed karlis o 's book change
 MSmits: that was 3 hrs of run basically
 MSmits: easy
 reCurse: euler?
 MSmits: so it's 100% win as P1 again if i want to submit :P
 kovi: sound of fan: says the one with 500score in numbner shifting
 MSmits: but I want a few more improvements
 dbdr: MSmits so you set it to the state just out of your book, and play that subtree for long?
 MSmits: yep
 dbdr: how do you know when it fixed it?
 MSmits: but its not workable unless the other person also has a book
 MSmits: because I actually solve the game where his book ends :P
 MSmits: it's solved after ply 25
 MSmits: so i cant lose
 dbdr: if you solve it, wouldn't it be faster with alphabeta?
 MSmits: if he didnt have his book go so deep, this would not work
 MSmits: not necessarily
 MSmits: my regular mcts also solves really well 
 MSmits: check some onitama games
 MSmits: it depends on how well the statistics guide 
 dbdr: ok, so it's comparable work with alphabeta search on that tree?
 MSmits: yes, but do remember its a double solve
 dbdr: depends which ones explores better
 MSmits: i play a mcts from a meta mcts
 MSmits: if the mcts solves on first turn, it reports a solved game
 MSmits: the meta mcts then records it
 MSmits: and solves further
 MSmits: so basically, a game may end on turn 55, but the mcts knows this on turn 1 and reports a solve on turn 40 to the meta mcts
 MSmits: the meta mcts already has many other solved branches and solves it up to 35 or whatever
 MSmits: (the regular mcts doesnt start at turn 1 but at whatever depth the meta is at)
 dbdr: right, so mcts solves a subtree
 MSmits: yes
 dbdr: the meta propagates that subtree higher if possible
 MSmits: so i never see the end of a game in the meta mcts
 MSmits: exactly
 dbdr: makes sense
 MSmits: so the karlis o branch is solved from 25, which is really shallow
 MSmits: he should just play different moves or drop his book entirely
 MSmits: i can keep doing this
 dbdr: it's cute that branches have player's names&#160;:)
 MSmits: it does now :P
 MSmits: I also solved all miare m and re curse branches as p1 
 dbdr: similar to how chess openings have names
 MSmits: if they drop their books, they will perform better vs me
 MSmits: but i prefer they keep changing their books
 MSmits: I enjoy the search&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: "hands up, drop your book"
 dbdr: Fahrenheit 451
 Uljahn: "don't do any teccles moves"
 MSmits: that helps too
 MSmits: teccles heuristic makes you very deterministic
 MSmits: so i have a point to start from
 MSmits: though ply 12 is a bit hard to start from
 MSmits: preferably 18 or so, then you're screwed
 MSmits: I personally use teccles heuristic
 MSmits: but I like it when people try to book me on that... then the book wars begin&#160;:)
 MSmits: I know, it's weird.... some people like crossword puzzles and some are like me :P
 MSmits: my biggest aspiration for uttt is figuring out whether it can be solved as a draw or as a win for p1
 MSmits: you can get fairly certain about this if you run enough games
 dbdr: that would be a huge achivement!
 MSmits: yeah it's hard to tell
 MSmits: normal TTT is even more unbalanced than uttt and its solved as a draw, so it's by no means clear
 dbdr: enough games might not be anough if there is a narrow path
 MSmits: hmm well
 Doju: Oh huh...
 MSmits: if it is a win for p1, then there are likely multiple ways, so you just have to find 1
 Doju: turns out i've made my bot a looot worse with some features
 MSmits: if it is a draw, then its probably harder
 MSmits: draws are deep
 dbdr: yeah. you still need to include all responses from p2
 Doju: Interesting excel graphs in the making atm :D
 MSmits: yes dbdr, but there are some transposition tricks as well for uttt
 MSmits: they happen mostly late game
 MSmits: if a board ends, it doesnt matter how it ended
 dbdr: true
 MSmits: it's a big O or a big X
 dbdr: clever
 MSmits: there's more like that
 MSmits: the state space is far smaller than people think
 MSmits: 3^81 is very naive
 dbdr: sure
 MSmits: I think it's  below 10^30
 dbdr: I computed the exact state space for TTT: 765, using all symmetries
 dbdr: again, useful as a test, and practice
 MSmits: for a TTT miniboard it's 8692 or 8962 , I forgot
 MSmits: because you cant use symmetries
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: mind you that is half of 3^9 or so, so even here there are many states to remove
 MSmits: 8962^9 = 3*10^35
 MSmits: but a lot of states are impossible
 MSmits: you need to have as many crosses as circles,  also, it needs to be a state reachable by jumping from one board to another
 MSmits: well or 1 cross more than circle
 MSmits: if you randomly place 10 crosses and 9 circles on a uttt board, the chances you will reach a valid uttt state is less than 1 in a million i think
 MSmits: would have to check, but thats my guess
 MSmits: I can talk about this forver, but I need to do some work&#160;:(
 dbdr: was interesting
 dbdr: ttyl
 MSmits: yup ttyl
 struct: I already regret coming back to Yinsh
 struct: Seeing this code
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl #4 on pac2020
 struct: They left the original name?
 dbdr: "spring-challenge-2020"
 struct: yeah
 dbdr: lacks poetry I think
 struct: SC20
 dbdr: then FC20, then SC21?
 dbdr: practical but boring
 dbdr: and no indication what it is
 dbdr: pac2020 says it better
 struct: 2pac would be ideal
 struct: 2 player pacman
 SabertheLost: so I managed to make my pacman think wall had pebbles. dropped like a stone&#160;:)
 dbdr: hidden pebbles in walls, there' an idea :D
 dbdr: secret rooms too
 dbdr: only lacks a princess to save
 JBM: that entails a castle
 struct: Code for community multies doesnt have to be public does it?
 AntiSquid: you can call it SC20 (starcraft 20) i call it peckmen
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr i think i'm too high right now. but might have been unlucky in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: didn't submit anything when the multi opened
 dbdr: I first put a different meaning in the "I'm too high right now" part :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl 4th? I'm seeing a pattern here
 dbdr: interestingly, all people who havent resubmitted have a date from yesterday evening
 eulerscheZahl: i'm "boring" in that regards. never even tried a single cigarette. and i don't drink alcohol either
 dbdr: but whole submit history is preserved now, that's nice
 eulerscheZahl: now that we don't need our wood bots anymore, we have them
 dbdr: lol
 struct: :D
 dbdr: struct I think all referees should be public
 struct: dbdr you dont wanna see this code
 eulerscheZahl: except the CG sponsored contest
 dbdr: I don't have to. I should be able to
 dbdr: the reverse?
 eulerscheZahl: public referee, pro open source
 eulerscheZahl: some of my referees are a total mess too. not proud of them but i hate missing documentation so i released them
 eulerscheZahl: i rushed that CG Funge in 1 morning and it's a total mess
 dbdr: it's fine
 dbdr: I mean in general, didn't look much at that one in particular
 eulerscheZahl: it should just be there. doesn't matter if you need them. just giving the option
 struct: I shouldnt reuse my old Yinsh code, but I want to rush it
 eulerscheZahl: even if it's all with French variable names and no comments
 kovi: referee with hidden tests? :o
 eulerscheZahl: the validators of my puzzles are on github
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan hardcoded 1 validator for Space Maze&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: But I know ways to get those validators anyways (much harder now, CG restricted access to replays. when I published, it was easy). So give the same chances to everyone and just make them public
 kovi: i thought that at least they needed to test-spam
 eulerscheZahl: in the past you could:1. play in IDE, get the replay ID2. submit3. play in IDE again
 eulerscheZahl: validator IDs are somewhere between the IDE games
 eulerscheZahl: and you could not open those replays in the browser but still download the json
 eulerscheZahl: but some users didn't know that and submit-spammed for 2 or 3 days :D
 AntiSquid: that's like some sort of CTF
 eulerscheZahl: and at some point CG protected them. but only the puzzle API. you could still download them using the multiplayer replay API
 AntiSquid: should have made some "honeypot" validators
 kovi: oh, i c

 eulerscheZahl: that was your quote, wasn't it?
 reCurse: He's kind of right though
 AntiSquid: yeah they're spying on english chat :o
 reCurse: I've seen that search mentioned a lot in japanese PMs
 AntiSquid: "It seems to be a meme like a mysterious strong exploration used by Japanese people in Kodoke overseas" what is Kodoke
 eulerscheZahl: codingame
 AntiSquid: yes i wrote that, i wrote it because 1 day legends are the real legends :p
 WINWINWIN: I am doing codebusters right now and am in Wood 1, the boss started with 6 points above #2
 WINWINWIN: I just submitted and brought the boss down by 3 points
 WINWINWIN: But still quite behind
 WINWINWIN: should I wait or resubmit?
 AntiSquid: resub
 AntiSquid: you'll reach retirement if you just wait
 WINWINWIN: :D
 k4ng0u: I you consistently beat the boss resubmit :p
 AntiSquid: he brought it down by 3 points
 AntiSquid: i think the boss is well satiated of the beating 
 k4ng0u: if you just have 40/60 ratio fix your bot&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you can bring the boss down with a 40% winrate on such an inflated score
 struct: 55% is all you need
 WINWINWIN: But I reached #2 and have a high winrate against the boss
 eulerscheZahl: but no one will push you up. it's an old game with little activity. unlike the contest where everyone is actively submitting
 WINWINWIN: almost 80%
 jacek: whats link for connect 4?
 AntiSquid: if only 40% win, then just submit and hope for 2-3 wins, then resubmit -&gt; rinse and repeat
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c</a>
 jacek: also, those comments connect 4 are hilarious <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv">https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but don't play it jacek. i enjoy my first rank
 k4ng0u: well with a 40% win I would definitely try to improve the bot. it's nice to lower the boss elo but if you have no (little) chance to surpass him...
 avdg: you don't like deserved first rank?
 eulerscheZahl: guide them to codingame jacek&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: is that why you wanted the link?
 jacek: so youre 1st for now
 AntiSquid: it's a struct contrib?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: fragile first, don't break it
 struct: made in 1:30 hours iirc
 AntiSquid: well we have tulips and daises so w/e
 eulerscheZahl: i challenged you to do it in 2h
 struct: true
 struct: Only if I could finish Yinsh this fast
 struct:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i need to make a twitter too and tweet random nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: just retwett them quoting you
 avdg: blup bot?
 AntiSquid: i am going to to do tht first euler
 WINWINWIN: I submitted in connect4
 WINWINWIN: random.randint(0, 6)
 WINWINWIN: :P
 ShannonNorris97: How do you go back a league in bot programming again? I remember someone mentioning it before but I've forgotten
 WINWINWIN: dont think its possible ShannonNorris97
 inoryy: delete the account and re-create it
 struct: Not possible
 CyberLemonade: what's all this connect 4 talk about?
 WINWINWIN: CyberLemonade its a contribution that is not yet accepted
 ShannonNorris97: I believe someone showed it during the spring challenge where if you used a certain link it allowed you to try your code in a previous league

 CyberLemonade: thanks WINWINWIN
 struct: ShannonNorris97 that link is not available anymore
 ShannonNorris97: Okay, thank you struct&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i deleted it., sorry
 eulerscheZahl: but you can upload it yourself:
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl how do you find the links for these demos?
 eulerscheZahl: go to the official repo of the contest. download it and upload the zip on the contribute page
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't find the link. i created it
 WINWINWIN: Oh, thanks
 struct: I think he means for connect 4
 AntiSquid: don't you need a minimum level? 
 WINWINWIN: Yes, for connect 4
 ShannonNorris97: It's actually for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. I messed up in the first bit and now that bug's gonna be difficult to fix without being able to go back. Nevermind, thank you
 eulerscheZahl: i think everyone can upload contributions?
 WINWINWIN: You created the link?
 struct: I posted the link here WINWINWIN, long time ago since the contribution was mine
 struct: euler just saved the link
 eulerscheZahl: you can also upload UTTT. the referee is public
 WINWINWIN: Thanks struct
 eulerscheZahl: there are more lost contributions
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8266462d136bc0f9f853dd517ef1cf8f2e3cc6</a>
 CyberLemonade: ooh wow
 AntiSquid: well captain sonar used to be a lost contribution
 WINWINWIN: Can we approve the connect 4 contribution?
 WINWINWIN: Seems interesting
 eulerscheZahl: connect4 is weakly solved
 CyberLemonade: wait does the connect 4 have any extra rules?
 struct: no
 eulerscheZahl: making it boring for the compete section
 CyberLemonade: cause afair eulerscheZahl told me connect 4 is solvable
 AntiSquid: well there's checkers on CG so&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: is that solved?
 struct: I think so
 CyberLemonade: do we have tic tac toe?
 AntiSquid: google says yes
 CyberLemonade: that game has tons of possibilities
 eulerscheZahl: we have ultimate tic tac toad
 inoryy: tic tac toad?
 AntiSquid: Checkers is the largest game that has been solved to date, with a search space of 5×1020. 
 struct: 5*10^20
 eulerscheZahl: typo inoryyi meant toad toad toad
 struct: maybe
 AntiSquid: don't argue with me struct, i copied from google @_@
 struct: 5x1020?
 ShannonNorris97: CyberLemonade, I'm just getting starting the tic tac toe one now. It's really interesting because it's made up of 9 TTT boards, making an additional larger TTT board
 AntiSquid: yes
 struct: that is not large at all
 inoryy: eulerscheZahl toad toad? toad!
 eulerscheZahl: is that an ook reference?
 inoryy: toad!
 CyberLemonade: I meant actual TTT, not UTTT
 CyberLemonade: it's much harder
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/OmD64sL.png">https://i.imgur.com/OmD64sL.png</a>
 inoryy: TTT is harder than UTTT?
 struct: yes
 CyberLemonade: by far
 eulerscheZahl: is that the game version we have on CG?
 inoryy: am I missing a joke or something
 CyberLemonade: no joke we're all serious
 struct: euler you mean the checkers one?
 AntiSquid: well the "power to" part didn't get copied properly struct
 eulerscheZahl: yes, checkers
 eulerscheZahl: because there are different variants
 eulerscheZahl: with men capturing backwards and such. i forgot the details
 struct: yes
 AntiSquid: then let's have othello 11x11, not fully solved yet
 CyberLemonade: hmmmm
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game#Solved_games">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game#Solved_games</a>
 struct: 200 computers o.o
 jacek: 10x10 othello sounds nice, to fsck up with those bitboarder
 AntiSquid:&#160;!
 inoryy:&#160;?
 jacek: though one could cheat and use int128
 reCurse: You mean 12x12
 CyberLemonade: why tho
 eulerscheZahl: othello sounds easy to build
 CyberLemonade: so we're getting one eulerscheZahl?
 AntiSquid: could just take the checkers game and edit it a little :p
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't say that CyberLemonade
 CyberLemonade:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but thursday is a public holiday in germany
 struct: you can make one CyberLemonade
 CyberLemonade: struct no knowledge of these interactive games
 eulerscheZahl: and i had to take off on friday or file a special request to work (which i didn't)
 AntiSquid: special request to work&#160;? lol
 CyberLemonade: dedication
 eulerscheZahl: there are a few day when holiday is on tuesday/thursday
 eulerscheZahl: then the company is closed on monday/friday
 eulerscheZahl: which doesn't matter atm as i'm working from home
 eulerscheZahl: but i won't compain about having a day off
 mutluexe: hi guys, can't we edit vim key bindings? 
 eulerscheZahl: edit your vimrcbut i guess your question is more about the online IDE?
 mutluexe: yes in this online IDE&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: why you go to settings in IDE, it shows under edit mode: classic, emacs, vimis this what you want?
 AntiSquid: when *
 mutluexe: nope i want to change escape key to inoremap jk for example
 AntiSquid: i don't know vim so your joke went past me
 eulerscheZahl: jk is scrolling up and down by default. that's all i understood
 mutluexe: lul no problem :d i guess since this is an online ide there is no option for that
 eulerscheZahl: there is an option for key bindings. no idea if it works for vim mode
 AntiSquid: press F1 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/</a>that's what codingame uses
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you find a guide there
 mutluexe: checkout "inoremap jk &lt;Esc&gt;" better than using Esc 
 eulerscheZahl: or you use your offline editor and copy the code to the website. as most of us do
 mutluexe: seems logical :d 
 mutluexe: thx
 struct: There are extensions that do this for you, so you dont have to copy paste
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't want to run an extra program just to copy my code. it's not that much effort to copy-paste
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: just dont accidentally copy it into the chat
 MSmits: if the chance of this is over 1% you will do this probably at least once
 eulerscheZahl: i was close once. not chat but private message to MK
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: somehow clicked hos profile instead of the IDE
 MSmits: i am paranoid about it
 eulerscheZahl: as you like kitboga and AI i think i have a video for you<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5R0Vnp6w4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5R0Vnp6w4</a>
 Astrobytes: Keep chat open in separate browser tab 
 MSmits: seen it already eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: disableChat in the IDE one
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: but thanks
 MSmits: good idea Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I've never copy-pasted my bullshit, I mean code, publicly yet
 struct: Me neither I must do this
 MSmits: me neither
 MSmits: well parts of functions, but on purpose
 AntiSquid: what? nobody else uses the chat box as temporary storage for their bot?
 Astrobytes: Speaking of the CG IDE, I quite like using it for puzzles. Multis/contests I use VS.
 MSmits: i do use it for puzzles on the rare occasion i try one
 MSmits: except the hard one. I would not do space maze in te ide
 MSmits: the
 Astrobytes: Well, yeah. There are always exceptions
 struct: i just used notepad
 Astrobytes: Fun fact: back in the day, circa 2001, I used to write perl in Notepad. Professionally.

 eulerscheZahl: but she's brilliant

 eulerscheZahl: how dare you to doubt thedailywtf?
 eulerscheZahl: blasphemia!
 dbdr: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: I don't believe half the stuff on thedailywtf but some of 'em are still funny dbdr
 dbdr: indeed
 dbdr: I love the one where each function is a separate commit in version control
 dbdr: then to call a function, you put its commit id as a comment, or sth like that
 dbdr: a script assembles the complete file
 Astrobytes: lol, there was one about storing JS functions in SQL
 Astrobytes: *SQL database

 eulerscheZahl: or he's just good and didn't want to demotivate us in the contest
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl Are we still using onaco IDE?
 Zenoscave: monaco*
 struct: if others got banned he also needs ban
 Zenoscave: I thought it was updated
 Astrobytes: Yep, still Monaco
 eulerscheZahl: just different config
 eulerscheZahl: the old IDE was ace editor btw
 Astrobytes: Fixing the Ctrl-S issue was such a pleasure for me
 Zenoscave: Oh right. Shudderring at the idea of ace editors
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that CG ever banned anyone
 eulerscheZahl: just disqualify from contest
 reCurse: On CG Ctrl+S should be a shortcut to submit
 eulerscheZahl: and a multiplayer is not a contest
 struct: I think Thibaud mentioned ban
 struct: of smurfs at least
 Astrobytes: reCurse that would be hell :D
 struct: ah he did not copy paste on contest?
 eulerscheZahl: remove from contest leaderboard. but account ban?
 AntiSquid: no just removal from leaderboard
 reCurse: Who's banned
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized that even the emojis are kept
 AntiSquid: only 18 accounts removed afaik
 AntiSquid: what emojis?
 eulerscheZahl: in the replay i just shared
 Astrobytes: Ahh on SPEED moves
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: ah
 eulerscheZahl: btw one account removed was from the one asking me and ceg to buy our contest codes
 AntiSquid: wouldn't matter they would still sniff out the similar bot if they wanted to

 Astrobytes: WTF! :D
 AntiSquid: she? was that a date request?
 AntiSquid: are you sure it's related to the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: just going by the profile pic
 eulerscheZahl: assuming genders again
 AntiSquid: well lady boys want to be a called a she 
 Astrobytes: So what was with the insult?
 AntiSquid: invitation *
 Astrobytes: She was one of the disqualified squad of students submitting the same code that morning?
 eulerscheZahl: i can't find her on the leaderboard anymore. So i guess she got kicked
 eulerscheZahl: but even if she thinks it was me who caused this: i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: just regular cheat detection hitting her
 Hjax: lol that chat log 
 eulerscheZahl: the insult came really unexpected to me
 eulerscheZahl: well i kind of was expecting it when i saw that she messaged me. but instantly without the smalltalk
 Hjax: why would you even cheat in a game like this 
 Hjax: whats the point lol 
 eulerscheZahl: university contest giving prizes to students
 Hjax: ah, should report the user to their university :D 
 AntiSquid: &gt; better grades &gt; better jobs&#160;?

 eulerscheZahl: for the background story
 aCat: yeh, interesting how the prizes will look like
 eulerscheZahl: not the official prizes aCat
 aCat: auh
 aCat: I just came up in the middle of conversation
 eulerscheZahl: just a university having additional prizes for their own students
 aCat: and you know, I'm still bumped up
 aCat: that's grat
 aCat: which one?
 AntiSquid: ceg has a point, 200$ is not enough
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea
 aCat: better than nothing
 AntiSquid: ah i agree on that aCat :thinking:
 Astrobytes: aCat is still building the Super God AI, that's why all the Polish students from UoW have been participating recently. Training.
 AntiSquid: maybe they're forced to do so Astrobytes
 aCat: we're just starting
 aCat: no need to worry
 Astrobytes: Yet...
 AntiSquid: next year they will be forced to reach legend?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't scare me
 AntiSquid: lots of dropouts
 Astrobytes: Good to see so much participation though
 JBM: does that still give more value to that contest's CPs or has the formula changed agaon?
 eulerscheZahl: biggest CG contest ever. and i thought the golden ages were over
 eulerscheZahl: go to your profile. click your rank. expand the contest section
 AntiSquid: it beat the accountant!
 ZarthaxX: i thought the same
 ZarthaxX: was nice to see CG still alive
 AntiSquid: ok but why did CG want to have a big contest this time?
 AntiSquid: why now&#160;? 
 Hjax: apparently my meh performance in pacman was still enough to get me to grandmaster rank 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sjvqgd">https://prnt.sc/sjvqgd</a>there's a fixed maximum and decay now
 Alshock: crap maybe I should have tried to push a last version of my bot then, so many points missed
 Hjax: next stop guru i guess 
 Hjax: only need twice as many CP as i have now 
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 eulerscheZahl: -3v
 JBM: how is ur csb
 Astrobytes: fix it Hjax
 eulerscheZahl: i like how you wrote "ur" instead of "your"i did that wrong when imitating him initially
 Hjax: i have the -3v csb bot already
 JBM: i know the character
 Sonex123: do someone has an idea?
 Astrobytes: Madeleine's very quiet these days
 Hjax: i dont have a good understanding of floating point games like csb anyway 
 Hjax: i dont think i can improve much 
 JBM: MadKnife
 Astrobytes: Perhaps he got a MadWife
 eulerscheZahl: a MadMade

 JBM: I'm getting the "Directory src/main/resources/view/assets not found." exception when running either the skeleton or the TTT game using the CG SDK
 JBM: what am i doing wrong this time?
 Astrobytes: Easily done eulerscheZahl, don't worry
 struct: JBM maybe you dont have that directory
 JBM: I do
 JBM: it comes with the git bundle in both cases
 struct: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: i got that too when i tried to build and run from command line
 JBM: i checked the code
 eulerscheZahl: worked with intelliJ, didn't investigate further
 JBM: it's in a specific FileNotFoundException block of a huge chunk of code
 struct: skeleton doesnt come with assets folder created
 JBM: with a hardcoded path in the println
 JBM: so, really, it could be anything
 JBM: well, a missing file of sorts
 JBM: but really not necessarily that one
 eulerscheZahl: it can't find the sprites needed to show the game
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: it's not even at "show" level yet
 JBM: that's before starting the http engine
 eulerscheZahl: did you clone the contest referee or building your own game?
 JBM: i cloned the tictactoe example and the skeleton one
 JBM: the ones linked from the SDK docs
 eulerscheZahl: how did you run it?
 JBM: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=SkeletonMain -Dexec.classpathScope=test
 TimothyDenOtter: yo, anybody know how to do Temperatures game in python3?
 JBM: (-Skeleton for the TTT one)
 eulerscheZahl: there's some fily copying to a tmp directory and launching a server
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know if you cover that
 JBM: i'm 80% confident that commandline worked last time
 JBM: well, i browsed that through the code
 eulerscheZahl: i never tried it that way. works with intelliJ
 JBM: not sure what additional covering i need to do
 JBM: i don't want to have to install yet another ide&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: eclipse?
 Astrobytes: "not sure what additional covering i need to do" - cover your eyes and bash the keyboard.
 JBM: this in addition to "i don't like an sdk dictating that i have to use one at all"
 JBM: tried that already Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: and make sure to update to the latest codingame SDK version (unrelated to your execution issue)
 JBM: errrr
 eulerscheZahl: just as the templates are outdated
 JBM: i mean, i just let maven download it with the rest of the half-internet it needed to compile
 eulerscheZahl: and now you can do it again with version 3.13.1
 Astrobytes: The SDK docs are not up to date?
 JBM: not much is&#160;:(
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: by editing that pom file?
 aCat: yes
 aCat: and import ass maven 
 Astrobytes: Everything comes back to that dam pom.xml file.
 aCat: *as
 JBM: wgat's that
 Astrobytes: Ass Maven :thinking:
 aCat: yeah, I love java&#160;;]
 struct: &lt;gamengine.version&gt;3.13.1&lt;/gamengine.version&gt;
 JBM: yeah, who doesn't
 JBM: still getting that exception
 JBM: with an additional warning now
 Astrobytes: The last time I messed with a referee locally, I got it all working eventually in IntelliJ, but was so annoyed by the whole process I uninstalled it all, deleted all files
 JBM: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'com.codingame.gameengine.module.entities.Sprite com.codingame.gameengine.module.entities.Sprite.setImage(java.lang.String)'
 JBM: yeah it's really not a pleasant experience
 aCat: 1) did you manually reload all dependancies?
 JBM: lolno
 JBM: i don't even understand that sentence
 aCat: 2) when importing project did you import as maven (not simply - form sources)
 JBM: i ran mvn compile and mvn test-compile
 aCat: whad IDE?
 JBM: no ide
 aCat: java
 aCat: no ide
 JBM: errr
 JBM: openjdk14
 JBM: i think
 aCat: I'm out
 JBM: well i didn't intend to have so much actual java writing to do
 Astrobytes: aCat he's using the cmdline
 JBM: surely that ought to be *possible*
 aCat: I know
 aCat: but using java with commandline is too much for me
 aCat: I can rarely make it working with idees
 Astrobytes: Using Java is too much for me, even with IDEA
 Sonex123: nice
 JBM: using a java-based ide is likely too much for that box
 JBM: (it's the crash-stream one)
 struct: I cant really help too, my only experience with java is with CG SDK
 Astrobytes: Ah that one
 JBM: probably useless to report it as bug anyway
 JBM: it'll just get "i'll tell the devs"d
 struct: All I do in IDE is load maven changes
 Astrobytes: You can do this in VSCode if you set up the paths though right?
 struct: I have no idea&#160;:(
 JBM: don't the ide's use maven under the hood anyway?
 JBM: this shouldn't be any different!
 JBM: this is so frustrating&#160;:[
 Astrobytes: Shouldn't be different&#160;!= isn't different unfortunately
 Astrobytes: I was going to refer you to the discord channel for a brief nanosecond there.... Forum post?
 JBM: as i witness
 reCurse: Yeah CG SDK works fine under vs code
 reCurse: The only sane way imo
 JBM:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: That's good to know. IntelliJ and the other Java IDEs are... painful.
 JBM: RIP my RAM
 Illedan: Anyone love to write statements? :P 
 struct: yes
 JBM: yes
 JBM: especially GOTO statements
 Illedan: I need a statement for my contribution xD
 reCurse: vscode is pretty well optimized, more than a java ide
 JBM: lol
 Astrobytes: JBM is your man. He can write page long puzzle statements that trigger people all the time&#160;:)
 JBM: reCurse: yeah i'm giving it a run
 Illedan: :D
 struct: My rate is 0.5€ per line
 JBM: Astrobytes: you know i can also write normal statements, right?
 Illedan: Make it 1 line struct. And I'll split it myself.
 JBM: the triggering part is a feature
 Astrobytes: I prefer your more creative ones JBM&#160;:)
 JBM: heh

 AntiSquid: inb4 pb4 ends up being twitted about
 struct: pb4 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/nQQQa8">https://ideone.com/nQQQa8</a>
 Astrobytes: Was gonna say, looks veeeery CSB -y

 eulerscheZahl: do you see the full track or always the next checkpoint only? :P
 pb4: struct thanks, but it's the idea behind the search that I don't get
 Illedan: You get the full track eulerscheZahl..
 AntiSquid: val said it's basically like beamsearch
 Illedan: And no laps, all are put in the same array
 pb4: To start with a concrete question&#160;:
 pb4: He writes in HStates[0]
 pb4: does "some stuff in between"
 pb4: and then reads a result in HStates[0]
 pb4: The stuff in between never moves anything from HStates[t1] to HStates[t2] with t1&#160;!= t2
 pb4: So.... why does he have anything other than HStates[0]&#160;?
 reCurse: pb4: It's a very popular algorithm amongst japanese coders, from my experience intepreting their PMs
 reCurse: It's just a beam search variant
 JBM: it's a heap
 JBM: i'd expect the contents of [0] to change all the time
 eulerscheZahl: i read it as a mix of beam search and A*
 reCurse: No not A*
 reCurse: It's still depth dependent
 eulerscheZahl: oh true. still states[t]
 eulerscheZahl: ignore me
 JBM: how could we
 eulerscheZahl: and i was wondering how to do the scoring in a reasonable way to try different depths...
 reCurse: My experience with beam search variants is there's no true way
 pb4: On my specific question&#160;: what is the use of HStates[t] with t&#160;!= 0&#160;?
 reCurse: Keeps the best states found per depth
 eulerscheZahl: iterative deepening
 pb4:                   if (HStates[t].top == null) break;
 pb4: Isn't that line always true for t!= 0&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: all dead
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: It pushes the next states in the t+1
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e739e328-3afd-41f5-9463-f3f48e6d9c98">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e739e328-3afd-41f5-9463-f3f48e6d9c98</a>
 pb4: +1&#160;?
 JBM: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: HStates[t].push(NextState);should be t+1 i think
 JBM: where's the +1?
 reCurse: There's a mistake in that code
 pb4: Would make a lot more sense to me indeed :D
 pb4: I'll imagine there's a +1 and re-read the thing then
 ZarthaxX: pb4 on chokuda i twitter he says it
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425/photo/1">https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425/photo/1</a>
 JBM: i'm missing some kind of backpropag here
 ZarthaxX: he said in one comment there is a typo
 ZarthaxX: it should be a t+1
 reCurse: \o/
 eulerscheZahl: congrats ZarthaxX. with the URL you pinged anyways
 ZarthaxX: translate the comments and you will see
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl ouch
 JBM: i see a beam of best first
 ZarthaxX: now we are gonna get tweeted again
 JBM: but no selection 
 ZarthaxX: :D
 reCurse: It's not really best first because it's still bound by depth first
 eulerscheZahl: chokudaiWidth is the selection
 JBM: depth appreas constant
 JBM: yes, forward selection
 JBM: that's the beam part
 reCurse: Selects by depth before best
 eulerscheZahl: depth = maxTurns
 struct: Now I have to put yinsh on hold, i want to try Illedan game
 eulerscheZahl: poor MSmits
 JBM: reCurse: not sure what you ;ean
 JBM: *mean
 Astrobytes: Why poor M Smits eulerscheZahl?
 reCurse: A true best first like A* would select the best heuristic regardless of depth
 reCurse: So depth has more precedence
 reCurse: In his algo
 JBM: i see nested loops of depth/turns * beam width of simulation
 struct: because once more Yinsh gets delayed Astrobytes
 JBM: and return what was given in indiscriminately
 AntiSquid: but this time i tweeted first ZarthaxX, got your backs covered
 reCurse: It's still iterative deepening
 reCurse: So not best first
 Astrobytes: I think tric trac wanted it more than Smits struct
 JBM: we're playing on words
 reCurse: No it's important semantics
 JBM: i mean best first as a class of alg, no specifics
 reCurse: Changes the exploration completely
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid lol ok
 JBM: ok
 JBM: but once we agree on that?
 reCurse: I dunno, I wouldn't call minimax move ordering "best first" in any circumstance
 JBM: fine
 JBM: not my hill
 reCurse: You're the one always fighting about proper semantics but not now? :D
 JBM: when they matter!
 eulerscheZahl: search algos don't matter?
 reCurse: But it matters more now than many other previous debates
 JBM: and yet even when i accept the change of terms you keep coming to the meta-semantics&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: like him having no avatar?
 Astrobytes: Nothing matters./me engages nihilist mode
 struct: search wont matter in future, euler is right, we only will need heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even see a difference to beam search in that snippet
 Uljahn: are those debates frequent on fr?
 JBM: ^ my point right there
 reCurse: The expansion is different
 JBM: Uljahn: only when i'm awake
 reCurse: It is actually complete
 JBM: well how do you select your beam?
 eulerscheZahl: it stops at chokudaiWidth
 reCurse: No
 eulerscheZahl: which is the beam width
 reCurse: That's where you're wrong
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 JBM: and tell us why?
 reCurse: Given infinite time and memory it will be complete
 reCurse: Just look more carefully
 eulerscheZahl: aaaah
 eulerscheZahl: it runs again when it reaches max depth
 JBM: so?
 reCurse: Beam search is not complete
 reCurse: This variant is
 reCurse: Very important distinction
 MSmits: best first search?
 eulerscheZahl: that makes it an interesting idea
 reCurse: There's more than just this variant btw
 JBM: so it's more of an "iterative-widening"
 reCurse: Kind of
 eulerscheZahl: i heard about wata search. but i only know the name
 AntiSquid: ok name a few please
 MSmits: oh ok you already said something abotu best first
 eulerscheZahl: psyho mentioned it recently
 eulerscheZahl: here on the chat
 Astrobytes: wata search?
 ZarthaxX: wat lol
 Astrobytes: yo Zarthonium
 MSmits: you already used Zartholomew right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 MSmits: kk
 ZarthaxX: hi Astrobytus
 ZarthaxX: MSmits lol

 ZarthaxX: did the choku user create this search?
 reCurse: google gives nothing
 Astrobytes: WATA: What A Terrible Algorithm
 ZarthaxX: wtf  is that eulerscheZahl
 reCurse: Yeah that's from him
 eulerscheZahl: chat history?
 AntiSquid: "Psyho: wata is way stronger than chokudai " euler doesn't that mean wata is a stronger player?
 MSmits: is everyone putting their own name in their search now
 JBM: you started it
 eulerscheZahl: we were talking abot the search algo before
 AntiSquid: euler in fact i remember that chat scroll up to kovi
 MSmits: yea :P
 AntiSquid: they were talking about players
 AntiSquid: someone way stronger than 1 day legend :o
 ZarthaxX: what is wata search lol
 MSmits: wakawaka

 reCurse: Still nothing about wata search
 dbdr: LayCurse
 dbdr: any connection? :D
 JBM: "stronger" is so vague
 TheDefyer: Sorry y'all, I know this is random, and in the middle of a conversation, but I have a question about debugging code that I'm hoping someone can answer.
 eulerscheZahl: kovi: he is the strongest (if we consider topcoder open finals)Psyho: wata is way stronger than chokudai
 JBM: TheDefyer: write them to stderr
 AntiSquid: it was a convo between him and kovi, scroll above i said it
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm not sure anymore if he means the algo or the user
 reCurse: LayCurse?
 AntiSquid: user
 eulerscheZahl: is that your wife?

 Astrobytes: from this link:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wata-orz.hatenadiary.org/entry/20100910/1284108575">https://wata-orz.hatenadiary.org/entry/20100910/1284108575</a>
 Astrobytes: dammit dbdr :P
 JBM: reCurse: so for the record, if your aim *was* to help understanding, the connection I was missing was simply "it's an iterative widening beam search"
 TheDefyer: JBM how do I send a message like that? lol I'm pretty new to this site.
 JBM: depends on the language TheDefyer
 JBM: there's usually an example in the stub provided when you start
 reCurse: You think I was trolling?
 reCurse: I was actually explaining it
 TheDefyer: I meant a private message... like a whisper
 JBM: i don't know
 reCurse: Not sure why you think otherwise
 reCurse: Blame me for not finding the right combination of words for you I guess
 eulerscheZahl: SRM is that short round with about 2h duration
 JBM: mostly because your explanation hinged on "look closely"
 eulerscheZahl: not what the average codingame is interested in
 dbdr: LayCurse could be reCurse pronounced by a japanese. R pronounced as L
 JBM: on code that had typos to begin with
 Astrobytes: TheDefyer the red text appears when you mention a users name
 JBM: i'm not blaming
 reCurse: dbdr: Could be, but since the original is written with roman letters, there's no alliteration
 MSmits: typos? did they write it in docx JBM
 reCurse: Or romanization
 JBM: wait did that meme reach here too now
 reCurse: Forgot the word
 MSmits: someone posted the meme&#160;:)
 JBM: translit?
 eulerscheZahl: the LayCurse meme?
 JBM: that's begging to happen
 dbdr: gtranslate says: "I commented because I remembered Lay Curse's 900 solution at SRM last time."
 TheDefyer: OHHHHHH okay thank you!
 pb4: I re-read the code, there's another thing that puzzles me.
 MSmits: what is Laycurse? Is that reCurse when he is being lazy?
 pb4: Do we agree that HStates[t].pop() means "return the biggest element and remove it"&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Sleeping, MSmits
 JBM: i do
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: did not know he slept
 pb4: When is he ever adding anything to HStates[0] then&#160;?
 JBM: there's only a single starting state
 eulerscheZahl: initialization
 pb4: He's adding something once at the beginning
 JBM: the "present"
 eulerscheZahl: but part of the snippet you shared
 pb4: then he'll remove it the first time he reads that element
 JBM: yes
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425/photo/1">https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425/photo/1</a>
 reCurse: That's the initial state
 JBM: remove = explore and expand
 eulerscheZahl: HStates[0].push(FirstState)
 pb4: then.... he returns HStates[0].pop()&#160;? Which should be == null
 JBM: that part's likely incorrect
 eulerscheZahl: 22行目のHStates[0]はHStates[MaxTurn]の間違いです。
 pb4: right
 dbdr: posting an incorrect algo is a pro move
 pb4: I need to learn japanese :D
 JBM: it's the part where you'll extract the first move of the best found instead
 pb4: Does make more sense
 eulerscheZahl: makes others think about it. now we understand it
 eulerscheZahl: as pb4 asked and we all looked into it
 MSmits: it would be easier for you to code a NN to translate it, but i think google already did that for you pb4
 pb4: Yeah... NN don't seem to obey me that well these days -_-
 MSmits: Teach it to understand French
 pb4: They just don't want to learn how to play BR
 JBM: nobody understands french
 eulerscheZahl: did you publish your ranking script btw?
 JBM: we just say fancy random syllables and answer to each other to maintain the illusion
 dbdr: JBM shhh
 Astrobytes: And vary it by department
 JBM: naturellement
 AntiSquid: only pronounce half a word
 Neumann: Are there Brave users around here&#160;? I just installed it and the IDE player remains black&#160;:'(
 pb4: So, this "Chokudai Search" would be somewhat equivalent to a depth-limited-beam-search-with-iterative-widening"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: write extra letters at the end
 JBM: and compress vowels
 reCurse: Yeah
 JBM: did we talk about our rube goldberg numbering system yet?
 AntiSquid: best example is quest c'est quel or whatever
 JBM: the internet meme was "qu'est-ce que c'est que ca?" i think
 AntiSquid: the contraction is weird
 eulerscheZahl: the 60*x+y?
 MSmits: iterative widening seems very useful, mostly my beamsearch is excessively deep because i cant find a different use for my calc time
 pb4: Seems like the iterative widening beam search would be better than Chokudai
 JBM: maybe even "qu'est-ce que c'est que cette chose-la" (which wouldn't really happen, as opposed to previous)
 pb4: in terms of algorithm complexity
 MSmits: not sure how to store the data properly between iterations of beam width
 pb4: Regular beam search only requires the call to nth_element, which is linear
 JBM: expand?
 MSmits: do you just do the whole search again pb4	?
 pb4: Whereas the priority queues in chokudai search are log(n) for each operation
 dbdr: what is it that it is that this thing there?
 MSmits: dbdr you sound like a broken google translation
 eulerscheZahl: you still have to sort the nodes before expanding the next level in regular beam search
 JBM: but you can't just elect to generate the best k from a state can tou?
 pb4: MSmits&#160;: yeah probably...
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: no need to sort, nth_element is enough and linear
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait. there was a faster algo for nth element
 dbdr: MSmits literal translation of a real french expression
 MSmits: ohh
 JBM: nth_element of what?
 pb4: JBM&#160;: yes, that's probably a big difference
 MSmits: well then i was right :P
 dbdr: :P
 eulerscheZahl: it's proven: i'm slow at thinking and typing
 pb4: nth_element of the vector of states
 JBM: but it's not the best nth until you sort it
 pb4: HA
 MSmits: i need to figure out how that nth element thing works
 pb4: Let me get you cppreference&#160;:)
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element</a>
 MSmits: I always sort my beam
 pb4: The element pointed at by nth is changed to whatever element would occur in that position if [first, last) were sorted.All of the elements before this new nth element are less than or equal to the elements after the new nth element.
 JBM: yeah, best k is O(N)
 Astrobytes: hm, didn't know that one
 MSmits: wait, it's changed? Dont you lose something then?
 MSmits: or do you change the pointer?
 JBM: that doesn't necessarily make it comparable to KlgN
 pb4: Good thing about Chokudai search is that you won't be completely deleting states if they get out of the beam
 pb4: Interesting algorithm&#160;:)
 MSmits: ohh ok i get it now, it's a partial sort with respect to one element
 JBM: see it as a quicksort's pivot
 MSmits: like 1 iteration of a quicksort
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 JBM: (that's how it's usually implemented anyway)
 pb4: not really MSmits
 MSmits: i mean what it does, not how it is implemented
 pb4: There's also the fact that the algorithm makes sure that the pivot is actually the nth element
 MSmits: yes, that too of course
 JBM: by recursion
 MSmits: I like it
 pb4: ^
 JBM: it *is* one of those algs i wouldn't have guessed on my own, and a very pleasant AHA moment
 MSmits: if I were not so lazy I would change my hypersonic bot to use this
 Astrobytes: fix ur lazy MSmits
 MSmits: I'm LaySmits
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 struct: Illedan what does this mean
 struct: "If the message is debug once, the game summary will contain additional information throughout the game. The referee will provide a double with the collision time occuring the previous round (or &gt; 1.0 if no collision occured)"
 ZarthaxX: this beam search version doesnt change the beam width tho right
 Astrobytes: put "debug" as your msg at end of output struct
 JBM: it does, but it's non-obvious
 AntiSquid: more likely to be emusmitso @MSmits
 JBM: each "timed" iteration adds 1 to the beam width
 JBM: there's a slidedeck hanging around
 JBM: that makes a lot more sense to me now we've had this discussion
 MSmits: emu? Isnt that some animal?
 AntiSquid: based on how they talk
 pb4: it adds "branching factor" to the beam width
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/emu.htm">https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/emu.htm</a>
 pb4: not 1
 Illedan: struct, means that you get the collision time with the checkpoint for debug purposes
 Illedan: MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/84237264ea233365577df010c3a68883d86556">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/84237264ea233365577df010c3a68883d86556</a>
 MSmits: they dont look that much like me&#160;?
 JBM: i'd say it as:
 mohammadhei05: :poop:
 mohammadhei05: fantastic\
 ZarthaxX: okey thanks pb4 and JBM
 JBM: it adds chokuWidth*branchFactor to the list of queued states
 MSmits: yeah I saw it Illedan, looks cool. Nice that you didn't just copy csb looks
 ZarthaxX: it adds branching equal to choku width thingy?
 JBM: but only expands chokuWidth of them
 ZarthaxX: for each tieration?
 JBM: so still 1 beam width the way i see it
 Astrobytes: Was same in BR struct, output debug at first turn and get collision info
 struct: I had no idea BR had that
 Illedan: struct <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace</a>
 JBM: but this one's semantics too, i don't think anyone ever normalized which side of the expansion is *the* beam
 Astrobytes: Well, I think it did
 MSmits: :emu:
 MSmits: nope
 pb4:&#160;:)
 JBM: :ostrich:
 pb4: Time to try this Chokudai Search on Illedan's puzzle :D
 Illedan: :D
 struct: Illedan where is this "double" given?
 JBM: and find wata
 struct: after angle?
 Illedan: A new line after that line in the gameloop
 Astrobytes: wata lotta confusion
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan what are these .DS_Store files?
 Illedan: Dammit
 Illedan: Didn't I gitignore them
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: you kept adding them at OoC too
 JBM: torpedoes. fired.
 Illedan: IDE files from VS
 JBM: oh my
 JBM: am i creating heaps of those right now?
 BenjaminUrquhart: iirc .DS_Store is for Mac file indexing
 JBM: isn't that .finder shit?
 Illedan: oh, thx BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: JBM no
 Astrobytes: JBM are you making/trying to make a multi or a puzzle? (just curious)
 JBM: lemme get that thumbdrive that collected mac poop the other time
 JBM: a multi
 JBM: don't hold your breath
 JBM: not one that's intended to get published
 eulerscheZahl: who's the audience?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I want that game of life one to get published
 Astrobytes: Nice. I try not to, it reduces my life expecancy somewhat.
 Astrobytes: *expectancy
 JBM: eZ some chap on #fr forgot his name
 JBM: it's their school AI projet
 JBM: it's suspected to have a closed solution, so not really ideal for publication
 JBM: but having the test arena would be nice
 Astrobytes: Don't have to publish past WIP stage
 eulerscheZahl: so you help someone whom you don't even know by nickname?
 BenjaminUrquhart: Illedan correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't search race basically a solo CSB as an optim?
 eulerscheZahl: that's dedication
 Illedan: yes BenjaminUrquhart
 JBM: naw, it's just personal fun
 BenjaminUrquhart: hmm
 JBM: but hey
 JBM: Y NOT BOTH

 JBM: it *does* work with vscode
 Illedan: struct, I want to make it VERY hard to solve it offline :D
 JBM: (and extensions and tweaks and stuff)
 JBM: so thx reCurse
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to solve it offline, you can...
 JBM: [but i still wanna cry]
 reCurse: yw
 JBM: do people really use this?
 JBM: it's so slow
 Astrobytes: VSCode? Runs OK for me
 SabertheLost: Great second place in broze =(
 JBM: it's like noticeable sluggier than firefox
 JBM: and let's not even start comparing with emacs/vim
 Astrobytes: But it's not as slow as IntelliJ, that Bean thing, and Eclipse right

 JBM: now why didn't i think of that!
 reCurse: runs perfect for me shrug
 JBM: on a gamer's rig
 eulerscheZahl: share some info about your hardware
 JBM: it's, errr
 reCurse: it's barely using a cpu and less than 150mb ram
 JBM: a 2-VCPU VM on my "lightweight" work laptop
 reCurse: Maybe it sucks in linux
 reCurse: shrug
 JBM: could be
 reCurse: Or maybe your setup sucks :D
 reCurse: (not hardware but config)
 JBM: i see a large java process
 JBM: 3G virtual 650M residency
 eulerscheZahl: had some fun experience with a live session code sharing with illedan
 Astrobytes: That'll be the JAva, not VSCode then
 eulerscheZahl: me using VS code
 Illedan: :D
 JBM: and an electron process 12G virtual 250M res
 JBM: my config... is the default!
 Astrobytes: lol, heard about that one
 eulerscheZahl: scrolled up and down, duplicating several lines of code a dozen times :D
 Astrobytes: The ideal live coding platform
 eulerscheZahl: then illedan revoked my write access :D+
 JBM: lol
 JBM: and that argfile is a 40-line -classpath
 struct: c++ doesnt show errors anymore?
 AntiSquid: was wondering the same thing the past 2 contests struct
 AntiSquid: but apparently it's just that some types of errors don't show up anymore
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the stacktrace is fked
 struct: ah it was not stacktrace bug
 struct: it was Illedan fault
 struct: for no error message&#160;:)
 Illedan: Oh
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Will fix
 JBM: i'm still not convinced i want to accept "having a shorter classpath" as a valid excuse for a different FileNotFoundException
 struct: I wasnt outputing anything
 AntiSquid: still think same happened in ooc
 Astrobytes: What's the debug thingy for Search Race? Just output debug at the end as I thought?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Cool
 Illedan: But you need to read without it the first round
 Your_Lord_And_Savior: e
 Astrobytes: Yeah cool
 struct: for some reason the car doesnt seem as fast as CSB pod
 struct: even on 200 thrust
 Illedan: Increase speed? :P 
 Illedan: I didn't do much on that yet
 struct: at least viewing wise
 Illedan: Frame time is too slow yeah
 Illedan: Set it to 5SX
 Illedan: *5x
 Astrobytes: you need +3 * vel struct
 Illedan: I tried for 30 min to implement 3* vel -.- Would be faster to write the frikkin SIm
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: im almost finished
 Illedan: I need to know if the sorting order is correct and if the scoring seems right :D
 Illedan: Should be asc right? When I want to minimize the time used?

 reCurse: Why an optim -_-
 JBM: what else?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm lazy rn and drugged up on painkillers, I'll read that tomorrow :P
 AntiSquid: why the hate
 reCurse: A multi where you have 2 bots optimizing the same problem
 reCurse: Optims are flawed
 AntiSquid: what about bulls and cows?
 reCurse: Hardcode sucks
 Illedan: reCurse, I'll add so many testcases that you can't hardcode :D
 AntiSquid: so much hate, you need more sunshine in your life
 reCurse: It's not hate
 JBM: not sure i see the link
 reCurse: If you think it's hate, you're the one in need of more sunshine
 JBM: more testcase just means more hardcode
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't mind
 AntiSquid: i will go outside tomorrow morning if it's sunny
 SabertheLost: FINNALY, silver league!
 AntiSquid: but there's a lot of negativity coming from you about optim
 SabertheLost: Now it´s time add real ai&#160;:)
 reCurse: Oh no, negativity
 reCurse: Guess we need a safe space
 JBM: should we make it optim-free?
 Astrobytes: Triggered chat
 Illedan: Optimize the safe space?
 JBM: need more safety
 JBM: MOAR
 AntiSquid: "hardcore sucks" 
 reCurse: *hardcode
 Astrobytes: Great optim idea Illedan
 AntiSquid: missread
 AntiSquid: alright i take it back, there's sparkly rainbow puffballs coming from you
 reCurse: yay
 Astrobytes: :rainbow: :unicorn:
 Astrobytes: brb, need to go and cleanse myself after posting those
 AntiSquid: i still don't see how bulls and cows can be hardcoded though
 AntiSquid: i decided to split it up though by size of the numbers so i will optimize for each size differently when i get around to finally implement it
 AntiSquid: i guess maybe that can be considered somewhat horded&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Zeno put me on to the idea of trampoline functions for B&amp;C, hadn't heard of them. Still haven't worked on it.
 AntiSquid: what are those?
 JBM: B&amp;C?
 AntiSquid: bulls and cows 
 JBM: oh right
 Astrobytes: Bulls and Cows 2, optim
 JBM: i think my mind is fully saturated on CG acronyms
 JBM: it just won't take any more
 AntiSquid: BC2  :D
 AntiSquid: before christ 2
 Astrobytes: WDYM JBM WTF 
 JBM: IKR
 reCurse: LOL
 AntiSquid: JBM is probably an acronym too
 JBM: here it goes again
 JBM: well, suggest ahead
 JBM: but maddy made the best one for now IMHO
 AntiSquid: unless you were playing mortal combat in the old days where you only had 3 letters for your player name
 reCurse: Jean-Baptiste de Montparnasse?
 JBM: classy
 Astrobytes: Jean-Baptiste-Millefeuille
 AntiSquid: i go with mortal combat arcade player name
 AntiSquid: or was it street fighter?
 JBM: i don't remember street fighter having a concept of score
 reCurse: It does
 reCurse: SF2
 JBM: oh ok
 SabertheLost: so barly made it to silver, and still end up halfway to the top? 
 JBM: well i don't remember it then
 JBM: whereas the mk one is very clear in my mind
 JBM: mk, mk, mk...
 JBM: mmm, nevermind
 Astrobytes: Jean-Baptiste-Malade&#160;;)
 dbdr: HAL = IBM - 111
 JBM: that's the ++IBM one
 dbdr: what's maddy's one?
 JBM: Java Bad Machine
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: iterally!
 Astrobytes: Yes but if you remember, HAL stands for Heuristic AL-gorithmic (and you can hear the sylabbles) :P
 dbdr: how appropriate
 JBM: that's how i'm feeling about the CG SDK right now
 Astrobytes: *syllables
 dbdr: git clone
 dbdr: mvn install
 dbdr: done
 JBM: wait, wat
 AntiSquid: John Bob Martin 
 JBM: naaaaw, not enough
 JBM: whew
 AntiSquid: i will remember that as your real name regardless of what you say from here on
 Astrobytes: Java Bites Me
 JBM: oh good one astro
 dbdr: what are you working on JJBM?
 dbdr: which repo?
 Astrobytes: oh no wait - Java Broke Me
 JBM: just getting the tictactoe (or skeleton, i'm not picky) to run out of vscode
 reCurse: Takes a minute
 JBM: (and then the ai puzzle from #fr this afternoon)
 struct: Illedan I dont know what is wrong
 struct: but debug messages make AI act dumb
 struct: or mes with refere
 struct: mess*
 Astrobytes: outputting first turn only struct?
 Astrobytes: outputting "debug" I mean
 struct: No
 struct: i dont use debug
 Uljahn: Jammin' Bob Marley
 Snef: struct your talking about Search Race&#160;?
 struct: yeah
 struct: Something seems wrong
 Snef: yea iget bugs to
 struct: or off
 Astrobytes: Oh you mean just outputting any other message
 struct: I think inputs are wrong
 JBM: good one Uljahn
 Illedan: What are you trying to print?
 Illedan: X Y THRUST
 Snef: some checkpoints got wrong coord
 Illedan: or EXPERT ANGLE THRUST?
 struct: ^
 Snef: my pod turn around a empty area
 struct: EXPERT but what Snef mentioned
 struct: im getting checkpoint coordinates on car inputs
 Illedan: w00t
 Snef: it's weird

 struct: Illedan this is my cerr for first testcase
 Illedan: Snef on my game?

 JBM: it's "run the test server" that fails miserably
 Snef: i know my mistake
 struct: Do you give checkpoints twice?
 Illedan: Yeah, there is no laps
 Illedan: I give them all 3 times
 Snef: i had a too little array for cps
 struct: AH
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Snef: didn't see it was 3* cps
 Illedan: You don't have to read it 3 times though
 Illedan: just use that cp counter
 Illedan: First int is the total x 3
 Astrobytes: JBM: J'aime. Bof. Merde.
 JBM:&#160;:+1:
 reCurse: This is now canon
 JBM: maybe we should set up a vote
 struct: So Illedan number of checkpoints give me 19
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: uhm
 Snef: 3*6 + start again&#160;?
 Illedan: yeah ^
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I forgot
 Illedan: but yes
 Snef: sad there is not leaderboard for optim contrib
 Snef: i mean demo
 Astrobytes: "I forgot but yes" - QOTW
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: QOTW?
 struct: checkpointId in car will give me 10 or 4?
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Illedan: :D
 Snef: what is your score Illedan&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Quote of the Week
 Illedan: 99% and 65915.70000001
 Snef: 100% 52771 :p
 Astrobytes: Just winding everyone up with acronyms now
 struct: Illedan, does checkpointId = the i in checkpoints loop?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: :clap:
 Snef: yes struct
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Tried to make it cleaner
 Illedan: guess it was too hard for CSB veterans
 AntiSquid: need to sign a PTBAU
 Snef: are you using same physics from csb Illedan&#160;?
 Illedan: No, currently I'm only trying to code as minimal as possible to test stuff. But I regret it at every stupid IF I add :P
 Astrobytes: Post-Traumatic-Bot-Action-Undo?
 Illedan: Snef, did you have multiple submits with 100%? Is the correct one chosen as the best? (lowest amount of time)
 Astrobytes: But IF-ELSE is the only way Illedan
 Snef: i did only one
 Illedan: Can you change something enough to have a better/worse score
 Snef: sure
 Illedan: just to see that the sorting asc is correct
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Snef: seems to work
 Snef: i have a better score now
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes petition to ban acronym use
 Illedan: Thx
 Illedan: I got 2 on 99&#160;% too and it kept the better
 Illedan: good stuff
 YurkovAS: Illedan is it possible to understand whats wrong in Search Race test #test85? I'm fail only this one.
 Illedan: Gimme a sec, I'll give you a screenshot
 Astrobytes: Nice AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: for a moment i thougth you'd guess it since i said "sign a P..."
 Astrobytes: My mind is numbed somewhat, earlier I would prbably have got it&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: *probably
 AntiSquid: are you getting any better?
 Astrobytes: Slightly less worse than when I went to hospital, but other than that no. 
 Illedan: YurkovAS <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/tzNk29J">https://ibb.co/tzNk29J</a>
 Illedan: YurkovAS, all testcases are here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/tree/master/SearchRace/config">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/tree/master/SearchRace/config</a>
 Astrobytes: Slightly less worse is a good sign though AntiSquid
 struct: Illedan is this meant to be solved offline?
 Illedan: Not when I add 500 validators&#160;;)
 YurkovAS: Illedan thanks
 Illedan: Then solving it offline would be a different optimization in compressing the data :P
 Astrobytes: :smiling_imp:
 struct: 500 validators will make it hard to pass all validators with 1 submit
 Illedan: Not with a decent search
 Snef: best score at 52 237 for now waiting you struct :p
 struct: I redid everything
 struct: because I didnt see that the inputs were "wrong"
 Snef: i have only one line cmon&#160;:(
 Snef: if you do a search it won't be fun for now :p
 JBM: ok
 JBM: so the mvn exec:exec variant works
 JBM: but not the exec:java one
 dbdr: mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=cp.txtjava -cp "target/test-classes:target/classes:$(cat cp.txt)" Main
 JBM: not sure i want to understand more than that now
 dbdr: it's probably weird, I just don't use mvn, so just got the classpath out and use simple java&#160;:)
 dbdr: that works
 reCurse: So it's just CSB physics?
 JBM: mvn exec:exec -Dexec.classpathScope=test -Dexec.executable=java -Dexec.args='-cp %classpath Main'
 JBM: that one works
 reCurse: I just export my NN and ezpz?
 struct: I guess
 dbdr: good too then&#160;:)
 Illedan: Your NN is very bad at just driving?
 dbdr: no IDE nonsense
 JBM: trying a new desperate thing
 reCurse: Not if that's what it trains for
 dbdr: JBM still desperate? doesn't it work now?
 Illedan: I made it so I can use it for my own NN training :P
 reCurse: Ahh
 reCurse: Explains
 JBM: but it works for bad/unexplained reasons!
 JBM: that's fragile as hell
 JBM: professionally, i wouldn't let this slide
 Snef: reCurse do you think that without opponent there will be as much difference between nn like yours and an ag&#160;?
 reCurse: Not as much difference
 Snef: right
 reCurse: It's pretty boring physics
 reCurse: But the difference is I won't have to think about anything
 reCurse: Just copy/paste code
 dbdr: if you used mvn professionally it woud probably take 30 seconds&#160;:)
 JBM: took less than that to the guy on #fr who gave me the exec:java one the first time
 JBM: but now it doesn't work anymore
 JBM: i hate cg
 reCurse: cg hates you too :hug:
 dbdr: did you try mine?
 JBM: and they remind it to me daily
 dbdr: one you got the deps, you don't need mvn
 JBM: dbdr not yet
 JBM: oh, explicit classpath build generation
 JBM: can't i squeeze that to a single line
 dbdr: it's probably weird of CG to put this Main in test
 dbdr: complicates things
 dbdr: I tried to, only managed to generate a file named "-"&#160;;)
 JBM: if you know a thing about java and want to suggest a good change, please do
 JBM: i don't have a standing here
 dbdr: I know a lot about java
 reCurse: Illedan this is the worst statement ever
 dbdr: very little about mvn
 reCurse: Congrats
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: `Statement is not done yet.`
 JBM: i used to know a lot about java
 dbdr: this is all mvn overcomplications
 Illedan: And I just broke it
 Illedan: LOL
 JBM: that's back when java was small
 Illedan: Maybe I should just link to  github. Remove everything else :D
 dbdr: right, I also know Java up to 8
 struct: javagod
 JBM: smaller than that
 JBM: 1.1 to 1.2
 dbdr: I did that too
 JBM: what's so special about thte cg stub that it doesn't raise that exception in its own jvm, but does in the mvn one
 dbdr: the exception means the classpath is not set properly
 Astrobytes: The whole maven thing threw me off completely. I used to get it before.... a long time go
 dbdr: I don't think mvn has a jvm, it just sets options
 JBM: "means"
 JBM: i like how you use that word
 dbdr: mvn dependency:build-classpath | grep -v INFO
 dbdr: that would avoid creating that file
 JBM: i'm attempting output to /dev/stdout
 dbdr: :D
 Illedan: Copying from BR2k and CSB into 1 statement without properly fixing stuff was a failure :D
 DragonJ: what amount should distance affect thrust? 0.1%  is my current
 Astrobytes: Better Call Struct
 dbdr: mvn -q dependency:build-classpathJBM

 dbdr: wtf
 Illedan: Lowest is best Your_Lord_And_Savior
 Illedan: wow
 dbdr: but that one works :D
 Illedan: YurkovAS
 Illedan: Lowest = using less time
 Illedan: And you need 100%
 Astrobytes: lol, the first tab autocomplete was best
 dbdr: JBM ^
 JBM: yup, better
 dbdr: I don't want to try to understand why a tool would ever end up working like that :D

 JBM: it's nowhere in the help page
 JBM: mvn dependency:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=build-classpath
 YurkovAS: Snef i'm use heuristic similar to -3*vel
 Snef: and you also have 100%
 Snef:&#160;?
 YurkovAS: yes 100%TIME USED 50509.2
 Snef: noice
 Illedan: reCurse, fixed the referee a little bit for you xD
 AntiSquid:  what are the best algos for langton's ant multi&#160;?

 AntiSquid: add Waldo in there too
 Illedan: Smaller space for the map though

 struct: wtf
 struct: 66%
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: add 3 grandpas with a chair
 Astrobytes: I know who Waldo/Wally is. I meant the tribunes
 DragonJ: snef you there?
 AntiSquid: Tribune is a democratic socialist political magazine founded in 1937 and published in London, initially as a newspaper then converting to a magazine in 2001. While it is independent, it has usually supported the Labour Party from the left. Wikipedia
 AntiSquid: well the gallery seats
 Snef: yea DragonJ 
 AntiSquid: ah forgot the damn word
 Astrobytes: Yea not sure that's quite the meaning we're looking for here
 AntiSquid: stadium seats
 Astrobytes: Ahhhh ok, the grandstands. Gotcha
 Astrobytes: Don't think it's necessary tbh
 AntiSquid: decoration
 AntiSquid: or garnish
 Illedan: The checkpoints are Trees from another game :D
 Astrobytes: Excessive graphical fluff.
 Astrobytes: (the 'tribunes' that is)
 Astrobytes: imo, ofc, ymmv
 AntiSquid: what about this definition
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c0727bce-9c01-4d8d-b7ad-b9fd15343d15">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c0727bce-9c01-4d8d-b7ad-b9fd15343d15</a>
 Astrobytes: Second definition is more appropriate
 Astrobytes: But it's actually just French for 'grandstand', ie. the stadium seats
 Astrobytes: As you said&#160;;)
 JBM: the "magazine" def is also valid in french
 JBM: but i diverge
 Astrobytes: Langue de merde :P
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm off
 Astrobytes: See you all tomorrow
 AntiSquid: oh rude
 AntiSquid: by
 AntiSquid: gn8
 struct: I cant evne get close
 struct: wtf
 AntiSquid: you only need a "decent" search
 struct: I probably just have timeout
 AntiSquid: and yet you blame the game
 struct: Where did I blame the game?
 AntiSquid: you didn't
 struct: Yet you said I did
 struct: w/e
 AntiSquid: i know, weird
 struct: Illedan can you check one thing?
 Illedan: sure
 Illedan: What?
 struct: I guess its not that important, but the game seems to go 1 frame after game ends
 struct: but the score remains the same
 Illedan: Yeah, car moves 1 more
 Illedan: But you wont get it as input
 struct: I guess its fine
 Illedan: I'll remove the first checkpoint as input btw. Since you never need it
 struct: 0?
 Illedan: Yeah, but if you use the checkpoint ID, you will never see the change
 Snef: also update the checkpointID so it's 0 at start :p
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: that is the plan
 Illedan: Made this in 4 hours. Everything can't be perfect xD
 Illedan: Updated the graphics btw. Let me know if it is better
 struct: viewer changed?
 Illedan: And made the car faster
 AntiSquid: make -3*vel meta
 Illedan: yeah
 struct: Seems nice
 dbdr: S1: Some(EmpiricalStats { won: 2, lost: 7, drawn: 991 })
 dbdr: \o/
 Illedan: Do you want any tooltips on the viewer?
 AntiSquid: x y&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or maybe the player message just like csb
 Illedan: Message on the timeline
 Illedan: Like, passed checkpoind N
 Illedan: or finished the first round
 Illedan: or ate a sandwish
 struct: Game information:null
 struct: is it timeout Illedan?
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: when does it happen?
 Illedan: I updated with 0 indexed
 struct: It was probably a timeout from me
 Illedan: Let me know if you find something
 struct: I need to fix my AI, I only get around 85%
 Snef: -3vel ezpz struct
 struct: What score with -3vel?
 Snef: depend on what you had with that
 Snef: but i'd say 50-53k
 Snef: i'm at 52.237 with only -Xvel and one condition for thrust
 struct: I think i just need to fix my sim
 struct: My car sometimes stay like at 1 distance from checkpoint
 Snef: ha you are doing sim
 struct: I get around 37k points and failing many testcases
 struct: failed test= 700 points
 Snef: fix your eval + add depth
 Snef: to fix staying in front of cp
 Illedan: Added exhaust :P 
 Illedan: YOu need to refresh to see it

 struct: NIce lol
 Illedan: Fun anyhow
 Illedan: Drop me a PR if you want to fix something in the statement&#160;;)
 Illedan: I'll go sleep
 Snef: would it be easy to add the same debug as csb&#160;?
 Snef: like seing speed vector and aiming
 Illedan: I can add the same as BR2k easy. Would take one hour or so
 Illedan: I'll add it to my list for tomorrow

 wlesavo: wonder how -3vel will do
 Snef: 50-53k

 struct: very smooth
 Snef: which testcase is it&#160;?
 reCurse: 19
 Xlos: For coders strike back, do we ever get a list of all the checkpoints or do we just need to guess?
 Xlos: I feel like I'll need to code them to even get to silver
 DragonJ: Xlos I dont think so but it does feel that way
 Snef: reCurse for you nn do you give all checkpoint as input or you only gives the one you are aiming plus one or two more&#160;?
 Xlos: Also does anyone know what the max speed and acceleration values are for coders strike back?
 reCurse: All CP
 struct: Xlos max thrust is 100
 struct: on legend league is 200
 iiAviator: What is the easiest bot programming one?
 Xlos: Wait is thrust just straight up acceleration in the direction of choice? I thought there was some hidden rotation parameters that occured when you choose thrust
 cegprakash: do we have the referee for fantastic bits?
 DragonJ: Xlos 604 is max speed
 DragonJ: xlos acceleration each turn is the previous turns movement * .85
 DragonJ: added on to previous turn
 Xlos: thanks
 DragonJ: deacceleration is the same function but for decreasing
 DragonJ: and Xlos dont forget about drift
 Xlos: Where did you find this info?
 DragonJ: its in gold info and it can be found through printing in one direction
 DragonJ: and drift info is from how it causes pods to occasionally spin around a checkpoint
 DragonJ: which can be fixed through changing thrust based on distance and angle
 DragonJ: and having a rounded print values is a need for example not going straight from 100 to 90
 DragonJ: and printing 0 than 100 is the same as printing 50
 DragonJ: assuming same point
 DragonJ: and changing x and y prints helps but I havent figured out how to do it without failing
 Xlos:  I'm just changing x and y, always keeping speed 100 rn
 Xlos: it took too long to get working though
 DragonJ: Xlos that wont work your code will do circles infinitely around some checkpoints
 Xlos:  I'm not though
 DragonJ: what league?
 Xlos: bronze
 DragonJ: this is my angle to thrust code 
 DragonJ:  (0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60), \
 DragonJ: but that is before adding distance into the equation
 Xlos: I'm not using their angle, I use last velocity as pod direction (maybe it's the same idk)
 Xlos: And then I normalize the angle between +-PI and change the xy of my thrust
 Xlos: By adding 1/2 the angle in the opposite direction
 DragonJ: not the same but same concept
 DragonJ: you still need to factor in the distance like I do 
 Xlos: I don't
 DragonJ: ok why not?
 Xlos: I don't go in circles close to the base because I tun further than the base is
 Xlos: I just got to bronze 1 cause I just got it working
 DragonJ: still even if you print better than me which it sounds like you do, distance still needs to be factored into thrust
 Xlos: I mean if I highlight the distance input of my code I don't use it anywhere in my code, it's 100% angle based and always 100 thrust
 DragonJ: always 100 thrust... I want to do that but how???

 Xlos: Oof I have a random commented code in there but that's the logic I have
 Xlos: Note complex multiplication is used to add angles
 Xlos: Are you gold league
 DragonJ: sorta have code in gold and bronze currently
 DragonJ: different languages
 Xlos: Ah cool
 Zenoscave: What is the easiest way to do a priority queue (MaxHeap) in C#? Must I make one myself?
 Xlos: No there is a prioirty_queue class
 Zenoscave: sweet. in System.Collections.Generic?
 Xlos: somewhere idk
 Xlos: I always use the one bits header xp
 Xlos: Oh wait I thought you said c++
 Zenoscave: lol nope. C#
 Xlos: Wow they don't seem to have a PQ big oof
 Zenoscave: Yeah. That's what I'm seeing
 Zenoscave: can a heap be done on a circular array structure easily?
 DragonJ: not easily C# is hard good luck
 DragonJ: I would see if anyone else using C# is online
 Zenoscave: DragonJ... what does C# have to do with a circular array structure? Since there isn't a builtin one I am making a custom one not dependent on language.
 Zenoscave: I meant more the algorithms
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave want to make a heap for the choku search?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Xlos: Wow that algorithm I just used is good shit
 Xlos: It just skyrocketed to beating silver as soon as I got out of bronze
 Xlos: No need to code shield
 Xlos: Ok maybe that's not true I'm stuck at rank 2
 WINWINWIN: Anyone here has done codebusters?

 Tien2k9: that's not easy but the difficulty is easy
 DialFrost: lol
 DialFrost: it shld be medium
 Dren: oh that one is pretty simple imo
 Dren: for parsing
 Dren: I was sitting over the resistance one way longer
 Dren: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building</a>
 Dren: what language are you using
 Flaise: The resistance puzzle is basically the same thing except you use a stack instead of a hashtable.
 Urutar: Neat, I just completed my 500th Clas of Code :D
 Dren: nice
 Uljahn: oh my
 Urutar: Thanks^^
 Flaise: Nice. ....That's a lot. :o
 Urutar: And it barely took a month total XD
 derjack: define 'completed'
 derjack: you can start and leave immediately, that would give more clashes
 Dren: LOL i GUESS 
 Urutar: Well, I finished em all including submitting my code each time?
 Urutar: So I'd call that completed.^^
 DialFrost: afternoon urutar &lt;33
 5DN1L: I think it'll take me a year or maybe more to finish 500 clashes &gt;.&lt; i'm not planning to do several clashes a day
 Urutar: Well, I did I think atleast 5-10 every other day or so?
 5DN1L: not for me lol
 derjack: happy Princess Luna Day
 Catdbb: bruh
 Urutar: Oh he can write
 Urutar: I question your resolve, Catdbb :D
 Urutar: You just started clashes and left em without even submitting anything
 Urutar: I think that's sad&#160;:(
 Catdbb:&#160;???
 Urutar: Yeah
 derjack: the only winning move is not to play
 Urutar: You were in several clashes with me
 Urutar: And not once have you submitted code&#160;:(
 Urutar: Well, derjack, my ranking would like to disagree with you :P
 Urutar: It's just numbers though&#160;;)
 Urutar: Back no topic: I think it's sad if you don't even try to find a solution... Sometimes it's frustrating and complicated, but definitely not always.&#160;:)
 Uljahn: i think it's sad if you don't even try to submit your own bot in hypersonic :upside_down:
 derjack: huh
 Urutar: Hypersonic? Lemme check :D
 Urutar: Uhm.
 Urutar: I did.
 Uljahn: check for Sayonara
 Urutar: :D
 Urutar: Sayonara?
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/595262004">https://www.codingame.com/replay/595262004</a>
 Urutar: Huh
 Urutar: Maybe my bot bugged out?
 Urutar: :D
 Uljahn: your bot? :smiley:
 Urutar: Ah yes :D
 Urutar: Or maybe it was me XD
 Catdbb: hi
 MichaelDu26: hello
 Urutar: Catdbb, please submit something in the clash.. anything...
 Urutar: It's saddening me&#160;:(
 achuso: ayy
 Sekoia: ugh, gotta do 50 clashes, that's gonna take a while
 Sekoia: also, any way to filter out "code size" clashes? The language I use is not good for that so it just doesn't really work
 BobLob: There's not
 Sekoia: rip
 BobLob: Which language do you use?
 Sekoia: Rust
 Sekoia: just i.o takes 100 chars, because of all the safety
 BobLob: yeah, it'll be touch to win shortest with Rust for sure, but not impossible. There are several clashes where just being able to solve the problem gives you the win.
 BobLob: touch=tough
 Sekoia: true, although when people solve it in 87 chars :P
 BobLob: My record longest was about 1200 characters in C, and got #1 in shortest.
 Urutar: Well, I think mine was about 1440 in C# or Java... and I was the only one out of 8 who solved it.
 Urutar: :D
 Sekoia: yeah, but those are hard problems
 Sekoia: rust just has more chars to write at a base
 Sekoia: so if you're the only one whoe solves it, awesome
 Sekoia: but otherwise...
 BobLob: If you want to place most of the time, you'll have to pick up a few things in other languages.  Regex in Perl or Bash works wonders, and can be learned in a few minutes, for instance
 Sekoia: yea, for sure
 Sekoia: I can write other languages, just not even close to as well as rust, and I wouldn't say I'm anywhere near good enough for clashes in those
 Sekoia: I mean... I guess I know java, too, but that doesn't help much :P
 BobLob: I did a clash a day or two ago that just replaced all 1s with all 0s, and vice versa.  In C is was about 65 charactes.  In Bash it was 8.
 Urutar: Dayum
 Urutar: Well, C# for that is basically overkill aswell&#160;:/
 Urutar: Hm, is there any point to retake a certification if I've already scored the maximum amount of points?
 Urutar: Pretty sure I can't improve it any further XD
 BobLob: On here?  The certifications are really just for funsies, but yes, you can retake it every 30 days
 Sekoia: pfft. Lowest was 93 chars, I was at 259
 BobLob: As for a point, no
 Sekoia: augh, just got lowest code size 3 times in a row
 derjack: oh my
 Sekoia: just got a lowest code size of 169 in rust, vs 209 for the second (although it's not done yet ll)
 Sekoia: *lol not ll
 Miarem: Can I erase some of my  oldsubmissions in the arena?
 5DN1L: Probably not
 Miarem: I spammed uTTT with submissions, quite a lot and now I can't even enter arena
 Miarem: Network error&#160;: status 504Gateway Timeout
 Miarem: Games with few submissions are working fine
 AlkhilJohn.: Ehh my contrib got accepted
 Sekoia: my clashes are glitched, I can't start any
 Sekoia: like it says "clash starts in:" and doesn't do anything
 rilerio: baiettiriccardo and valerio.belloni on insta&#160;;)
 5DN1L: rilerio no promotion here
 5DN1L: Sekoia sometimes I have to refresh the page to get into a clash
 Sekoia: that makes it leave the clash no? (also idk how to reply to pms)
 5DN1L: no, refreshing it gets you into the clash; that link still works
 5DN1L: What PMs? PMs in this chatroom?
 Sekoia: I wasn't sure what the red text was, but it's a ping not a private message
 Sekoia: nvm, anway
 Sekoia: It seems to work now? idk
 5DN1L: Red text isn't private message
 5DN1L: Red text is when I ping you by typing your name here Sekoia
 Sekoia: ahh I see
 5DN1L: It's essentially like @somebody in other chatrooms
 Sekoia: yea

 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Urutar: Hmmmm, how come in a CoC chat there is a message saying "Wow, you're sending too many messages. Please, don't spam the chat."?
 5DN1L: wow, is it system-generated?
 Urutar: Yep
 5DN1L: how odd
 Urutar: Wrote 5 messages in short order&#160;:/
 Urutar: Well, tried to, atleast
 Sekoia: dammit
 Sekoia: I almost won a CoC but I just barely didn't have the time
 5DN1L: sad
 Sekoia: it was a reverse, and I got 60% of it, then at the last 2.5 minutes I got the rest of it
 Sekoia: but I didn't have time to do the stuff
 5DN1L: what's your final rank?
 Sekoia: and then I didn't have time to upload the 60% I had 
 Sekoia: well, actually I misclicked and didn't upload
 5DN1L: better upload it earlier next time
 Sekoia: well I can't submit
 Sekoia: it's just that when it said "time's up" I clicked out of it because I wanted to code it lol
 5DN1L: 60% is better than none
 Sekoia: yes, but I misclicked, that's all
 iyedgivehead: What solution did you guys have if i may ask
 Sekoia: ugh, I had a hard puzzle in CoC and was a minute away from finishing when we ran out of time
 5DN1L: wow, are you trying to finish 100 CoC today?

 pyprogammer: how to do that do we need to do binary power function
 pyprogammer: i got 83 only
 chenhaorantianjiayi: @Catdbb 105219989
 Urutar: That's wrong XD
 Urutar: 109 * 965321= 105219989;But109 ** 965321 == 109^965321
 Urutar: There's a difference
 Thorcode: nothing wrong
 Thorcode: it just multipy and power XD
 Urutar: ^^
 5DN1L: Python says the answer starts with the digits 3840772122 and there are like 5000 digits
 Alexander97: Urutar is tha for Python only?
 Urutar: No, ruby aswell
 Urutar: Most languages which support **
 jacek: c++ also supports double pointer :v
 pyprogammer: pow(a,b) also can be used in python but ** is kind of shortcut
 Tien2k9: math.pow() in c++
 pyprogammer: 5000 digits cannot come in single int. I really want to if author wanted us to implement string multiplication in shortest code
 Urutar: try long
 Urutar: ur ulong
 Urutar: *or ulong
 pyprogammer: 10^5000 is too much to fit in any datastructure
 Tien2k9: long long
 pyprogammer: 10^5000 number is kind of 2MB if stored in int format lmao
 eulerscheZahl: "I really want to if author wanted us to implement string multiplication in shortest code"no, the expected answer probably involves logarithms

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Sounds like I need to put together another 10-20 high quality culture-free reverse contribs

 Schwase: reverse are fun but some of them are pretty dumb sometimes. I'd really like if the site added more code golf puzzles and maybe had a contributed-code golf section. Taking time to do a code golf puzzle can be fun
 Ottovon: omg yes!!!! If there was a way to play only the "shortest mode" Clashes, that would be so awesome
 Schwase: if it was like the puzzles section that would be cool
 jacek: yet people comlain on the shortest. maybe because thet use java or C#
 Schwase: i used to be one of those people
 Schwase: but after doing the 4 code golf puzzles, i have a taste for more of them
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: You could make a golf contrib out of an optim, but the leaderboard wouldn't be split by language
 Schwase: yeah some of the best euler puzzles are CGFunge and Bender which are very "shorest code"-esque in their nature
 Andriamanitra: i think complaining about shortest is silly, no one is forced to use java
 Andriamanitra: and in the code golf puzzles section leaderboards are by language anyway 
 Andriamanitra: only complaint i have about shortest is that the test cases usually suck and the winning solutions end up being hard coded or just ignoring edge cases

 EruRoraito: Hello guy, i'm doing the offset arrays puzzle in javascript, i'm lost...can you help me what direction i should take to solve it&#160;?  
 EruRoraito: thank you guys
 jacek: recursion eh
 Andriamanitra: hey i think that's my puzzle :D there are many approaches you could take
 hmAHn: when i use speed command?
 Andriamanitra: not sure about javascript but in other languages i think a nice way is to implement a custom class
 Andriamanitra: that keeps track of the starting index
 EruRoraito: yeah it's your puzzle Andria haha
 EruRoraito: i see in discussion someone used dictionary to solve it without recursion 
 EruRoraito: i'm not cool with recursion that's why i would like to check another way ^^
 USSR_Chicken: ^u^
 Schwase: what hard coded solutions are there for code golf puzzles&#160;??
 Schwase: you have no way of knowing the validators
 jacek: :smirk:
 Schwase: even if you did it still wouldn't be the shortest solution typically
 5DN1L: The forum thread of the individual code golf puzzles may give you some insight
 Schwase: which thread?
 5DN1L: the code golf puzzles have their own threads
 Schwase: i see a python cheatsheet and a clash of code with a blurb about shortest but not code golf in particular
 Schwase: oh
 Schwase: interesting
 Schwase: i never thought that would be possible for code golf
 Schwase: i dont mind hard coded solutions because at the end of the day, the leaderboard is the leaderboard. As long as its not tooo simple where everyone can easily get the shortest, its not too bad
 jacek: nyoro~n
 jacek: Automaton2000 who's the best pony?

 Andrisssd: hello world
 DerelictD: null pointer exception
 Attila_KZ: cant understand this quesion
 Attila_KZ: Increment the given integer by one until the original digits don't show up.
 Majeck: Increment means +1
 Majeck: Digits are the numbers inside a number, the digits of 123 are 1, 2, 3
 Majeck: So a quick solution to yours would be in pseudocode:
 Andrisssd: what does mean original digits
 Attila_KZ: the given digits
 Majeck: While any original digit in current number:
 Attila_KZ: ohhhh ok get it 
 Andrisssd: how you doing m8's
 Majeck: I was trying to figure out how to multiply an array full of floats till it was all ints
 Majeck: Then I realized that one of the conditions of the array is that there is a value "1"
 Majeck: So I can just loop through all the numbers from 1 to 100  multiplying if needed till it's all ints
 Majeck: How you doing Andrisssd?
 Andrisssd: fine, going sleep, good luck!
 Sombody101: hehehe
 Majeck: What did you do Sombody101?
 DerelictD: or use Mod (%) so you can increment each digit quicker.  i.e. less cycles. 
 Majeck: I think you used i.e. wrong
 DerelictD:&#160;?
 Majeck: Nevermind
 Majeck: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/i.e">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/i.e</a>.
 Majeck: Lol
 Majeck: You used it right
 DerelictD: yeah, i thought so.  confused me for a sec. 
 Majeck: I was thinking of e.g sorry
 Majeck: Was your suggestion of using Mod directed at me?
 DerelictD: yeah. my point was that if you're incrementing each digit of a number, just doing a ++ loop will increase the number of cycles it takes to complete for larger and larger numbers.  
 Majeck: Ohhh
 DerelictD: for exacmple, 123.  it'd take 111 loop cycles to complete
 Majeck: That's smart
 DerelictD: if its 1230, it takes 1110
 DerelictD: err. 1111
 DerelictD: my bad

 Majeck: Man, these matrices are killing me

 zakacat: but they can take many shapes
 Majeck: Yeah, it's just I need to solve a system of equations
 Majeck: Right now I had:
 Majeck: So I looked up how to solve it using python and it said to make a matrix with the coefficients
 Majeck: And then use numpy.linalg.solve
 Majeck: But it doesn't want to, mean python
 zakacat: are you supposed to write your own method?

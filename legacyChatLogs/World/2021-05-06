 Kitt66: i need help
 Notter:&#160;?
 GiovanniDe: hi guys:innocent:
 Smelty: hello mr angel
 gigolo: exited for contest :p
 gigolo: *c
 gigolo: in mean max what reaper means&#160;?
 GiovanniDe: HI hi
 gigolo: hhi
 GiovanniDe: haha
 Smelty: hh
 davilla: counting down these hours...
 Lowz: Who's all waiting for the competition to drop? 
 gigolo: drop&#160;?
 Lowz: drop!
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 drop it
 Automaton2000: first i have to type it
 Hudinid: what are the 2 different rankings in CoC? like it says my ranking is 3,349 but when I hover myself It says 13345
 gigolo: global and country
 gigolo: maybe global rank and clash rank :p
 r-k-g: yeah pretty sure its that last one
 r-k-g: your rank on all of codingame.com and your rank in clash
 davilla: 8 hours... I feel kinda crappy from the covid shot and I can't even sleep
 r-k-g: worth it tbh
 r-k-g: still sucks tho
 davilla: covid shot or the challenge?
 r-k-g: covid shot lol
 gigolo: :joy:
 davilla: I should have gotten it a day earlier
 JormaW: Are you telling me that the mars lander doesnt have more levels than one?!&#160;:&lt;
 JormaW: Ah found the second but dunno why it didnt transfer there after completing the first one
 davilla: They solo puzzles aren't really grouped together, except by name
 3141948: davilla: same for me, could not sleep well last night after covid shot
 3141948: Sorry Message was for r-k-g 
 3141948: Ah no you both had covid shot sorry
 StrayCat09: .
 Mr_BlueBird: &gt;&lt;
 Mr_BlueBird: &gt;&lt;
 LordSkaven: 7 hours is too long to wait. I want to start now..... MOMMY!!!! xxD
 davilla: I'm definitely going to be asleep at launch.
 gigolo: every minute an approve wow 
 gigolo: the approve button should disable for those who don't solve pending clash puzzle whatever
 davilla: setting my alarm for 6 hours
 Marchete: TIL you can create fixed arrays on C# structs
 Marchete: struct fixedArray{	unsafe public fixed byte cell0[6];}
 TobiasA: i can't wait to not be on the leaderboard
 chessplayer24: i want to improve in c but i am new here and do not know how to use that&#160;? help&#160;?!
 cipryyyy: cacca
 AntiSquid: help with what?
 AntiSquid: disclaimer: not offering help, just annoyed with the ambiguity of the request
 chessplayer24: please :zzz:
 TobiasA: the best way is to learn c somewhere else then practice here
 AntiSquid: you can start here and google any questions regarding syntax TobiasA
 AntiSquid: at some point you might want to learn a new language anyway
 TobiasA: you could but it is easier the other way around
 AntiSquid: don't tell me what's easier for me @_@
 AntiSquid: thank you
 TobiasA: i didn't mention you
 AntiSquid: you were talking to me, Automaton2000 handle this for me
 Automaton2000: you mean that you have a good way to pick the most promising one. i then set current node to ...
 chessplayer24: need some challenges but the structure of the website is bit werid
 chessplayer24: AntiSquid  Are you bot?
 AntiSquid: are you a bot?
 jacek: chessplayer eh? why dont you try chess
 Uljahn: chessplayer24: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55547/how-to-get-started-on-codingame">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55547/how-to-get-started-on-codingame</a>
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 LordSkaven: isnt everyone here a bot?
 programmmmer: beep boop
 chessplayer24: oh thanks man,god bless you , jacek i am good there so looking to improve in sth new
 chessplayer24: your computer type funny things 
 LordSkaven: Oh you mean bot as in robot, I thought you meant bottom
 TheBouncyJelly_728d: no bot here!
 TobiasA: i'm a bot
 chessplayer24: Yeah man he just answered me fast , dude i thought he was a bot but my bad
 AntiSquid: jace is a bot, he runs automatic adverts for paper soccer
 chessplayer24: to be honest i do not think c is a good language to code games here , you need oop language 
 AntiSquid: so anyone helping would have wasted their time?
 chessplayer24: do you know other Websites&#160;? i hate asking google to help while there is many bots here , joking you guys know more than google so help me 
 AntiSquid: learning to google is an important life skill
 TobiasA: codewars
 chessplayer24: you right 
 chessplayer24: waw ok i will check that 
 TobiasA: but there are no visual stuff like this site
 chessplayer24: yeah i see its all black i feel sleepy now
 TobiasA: that's the only other one i know
 AntiSquid: i know dozens of sites for competitive programming
 AntiSquid: all through google / duckduckgo
 gigolo: atcoder is my fav besides game programming
 VizGhar: are you happy with duckduckgo? I'm mostly not very sattisfied with its results (I know why the results are way they are, but still)
 AntiSquid: you need extra alternative to google
 AntiSquid: i don't mind the design and it's not as intrusive with ads
 AntiSquid: with google alone you sometimes get wrong results
 AntiSquid: also google has bias in results which really screws up the searches in very horrible ways
 AntiSquid: problem is i am sure duckduckgo has less sites indexed
 KalamariKing: Yeah, it does
 KalamariKing: Also gm, 4 hours, y'all ready?
 DiscoChildOfDeath_937: hi there
 gigolo: :heart_eyes:
 KalamariKing: Hello there, DiscoChildOfDeath_937! Interesting name you got there
 DiscoChildOfDeath_937: its automatically name kek
 DiscoChildOfDeath_937: idk how to change it&#160;;)
 gigolo: :joy:
 gigolo: go to profile
 Notaboredguy: should work now
 Notaboredguy: bruh
 gigolo: ur name is True
 Notaboredguy: wha
 Notaboredguy: should be Notaboredguy
 AntiSquid: KalamariKing is that your alt or your main? if i find your main:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/lZHH6TF">https://imgur.com/a/lZHH6TF</a>
 Notaboredguy: yummy
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid take mercy, I wish not to crisp
 KalamariKing: have mercy for your fellow squiddy boi
 AntiSquid: wrong type of squid, also not a squid
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aV7EeRw_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aV7EeRw_700bwp.webp</a>
 gigolo: :o
 jacek: those japanese and theirs squids
 AntiSquid: maybe the town tries to promote fertility
 struct: hi
 AntiSquid: hi struct
 AntiSquid: did you get the message invite on forums&#160;?
 AntiSquid: someone rightfully praised me for your Yinsh game
 jacek: you approved it
 struct: no
 AntiSquid: oh i did have a part in it
 struct: Where is this message?
 struct: ah I see now
 struct: ill fix it after the contest
 AntiSquid: optplx 
 optplx: :wave:
 optplx: thanks struct&#160;:) 
 gigolo: :fish:
 TobiasA: how do i do that inline if-else statement in c++ but without the else returning anything?
 DomiKo: what?
 AntiSquid: @_@
 DomiKo: you mean (statement&#160;? true&#160;: false)
 DomiKo: yes?
 FlexYourJS: just use  &amp;&amp;
 FlexYourJS: isTrue &amp;&amp; doSomething();
 TobiasA: yes
 TobiasA: that one
 TobiasA: the one domiko wrote
 FlexYourJS: if you use the ternary operator you are required to put something for `else`
 AntiSquid: ternary operator without the else&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: :joy:
 FlexYourJS: so instead of that.. just use `&amp;&amp;`
 DomiKo: ternany operator requires that "true" and "false" types are the same
 DomiKo: so you can't even do (statement&#160;? int&#160;: string)
 TobiasA: or is there like a word i can use to skip that line if false
 AntiSquid: a = (condition) * value 
 FlexYourJS: or you may also use ||
 AntiSquid: || for what
 FlexYourJS: not sure if it's applicable in C++
 FlexYourJS: can you try it?
 TobiasA: me?
 FlexYourJS: int iWantThisToBeFive = !isValueTrue || 5
 FlexYourJS: isValueTrue = true
 TobiasA: nvm i've found out something thanks for the help tho
 AntiSquid: what did you find
 FlexYourJS: Who among you have played Ghost in the Cell?
 TobiasA: i found an alternative to what i am trying to do
 AntiSquid: what's wrong with the if?
 TobiasA: nothing
 FlexYourJS: probably want's shortest code
 AntiSquid: without the else it's just if(statement)do_stuff
 AntiSquid: ah
 TobiasA: yea i want short code
 FlexYourJS: statement &amp;&amp; do_stuff
 AntiSquid: a lot of the code golf tricks try to avoid if statements 
 AntiSquid: entirely
 FlexYourJS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca1d23ac-efed-4543-b9a3-88c80d790098">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca1d23ac-efed-4543-b9a3-88c80d790098</a>
 TobiasA: oooouuu i understand your logic now
 TobiasA: that's a nice one
 TobiasA: wait but won't that return a bool?
 Nerchio: would like some fog of war 
 Nerchio: would be nice
 TobiasA: what is fog of war?
 MSmits: TobiasA missing information
 MSmits: it's a term coming from real time strategy games where you can see all your own units, but not the opponents units unless they are near your own
 MSmits: I dont like it generally... except in ocean of code, there the fow was central to the game and it worked nicely
 Passifi: for the young folk in the chat real time strategy games were, what we used to play before LoL and Dota got hip 
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: well they know starcraft probably
 MSmits: but they dont know there are 100s of games like that
 Passifi:  yupp another glorious genere that just vanished, like space flight simulations, or Sierra Adventure games or pong clones ahh the nostalgia 
 MSmits: just like they dont know that once upon a time we had shoot em ups where you didnt build ramps
 MSmits: Passifi it's still out there, if you go on steam, but they're more indy-like
 TobiasA: oh you mean those topdown strategy games
 TobiasA: i see
 MSmits: well top down was just convenient, so you can select your units easily
 MSmits: but the main thing is that you control a large army in real time and you build the army from resources, so you need a base etc.
 Nerchio: It might be bias but I felt like games with fog of war were easier to make it high in legend
 MSmits: Nerchio it's not bias
 TobiasA: i am very bad at anything that involves managing recources or making armies
 Nerchio: so more fun for me personally
 MSmits: we have a lot of really strong players that normally top the ranks but dont know how to deal with fow&#160;:)
 MSmits: so of course you get legend more easily
 MSmits: this is why you get so much complaining about it
 MSmits: because they cant use their usual bag o tricks
 MSmits: most of them figure out a way anyway, but some dont and that makes it easier to get legend
 Nerchio: yep thats why i probably like it
 Nerchio: lets see what they came up with this time
 MSmits: yeah, i am curious also
 MSmits: i'll probably like it for at least a few days, if it's a good game, all the way to 11 days
 MSmits: sometimes you run out of ideas early, thats a bit frustrating
 MSmits: but usually i just lack the time and energy to try it all
 Nerchio: i got demotivated during pacman in top gold and made legend in potion challenge
 Nerchio: but looking back at it the idea behind pacman was more fun for me
 MSmits: ahh pacman went ok for me, but i didnt have time for the potion game&#160;:(
 Nerchio: potion was a good game but turned into hard simulation too much
 MSmits: I think i got a quick bronze on the last friday is all
 Nerchio: or rather search i mean
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: that seemed predictable to me
 MSmits: it has fairly few variables
 Nerchio: the only difference was I started talking with the polish CG community more during potion challenge so the motivation boost was enough to push to legend
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: yeah that can help
 MSmits: chat can also stop you from coding&#160;:)
 MSmits: or you can give away too much
 Nerchio: well I don't see myself giving away too much tbh
 Nerchio: its mostly the very top that needs to care about this
 MSmits: i dont think i have done that in contest personally
 MSmits: traded some ideas with other players in pm
 MSmits: but outside of contest i always give away too much :P
 pb4: hi
 KalamariKing: Howdy
 MSmits: hey pb4
 MSmits: and KalamariKing
 pb4: Just out of curiosity, Nerchio are you the Nerchio from SC2&#160;?
 KalamariKing: A good portion of players won't understand half of it tho, especially with this years' influx of newbies
 Nerchio: yeah
 pb4: Nice&#160;:)
 Nerchio: I mean its not like we are playing for milions of $, I feel like sharing is more fun for me
 MSmits: every time he is on someone asks that :P
 Nerchio: but i can share more with people who arent in the top :D
 Tiramon: contest is about to start and all known names start to crawl out of their holes&#160;;)
 pb4: As for "sharing too much" when being at the top, it is definitely something in the back of the mind
 pb4: but... share a bit, get a reaction from somebody else, maybe it'll tip you towards an interesting direction
 Nerchio: i don't have anything to share with pb4 because he does 3x more interesting stuff in his bots 
 pb4: haha
 DomiKo: trueee
 pb4: On the contrary
 pb4: I tend to go towards overcomplicated stuff
 MSmits: yeah, the top players dont need code shown too them to get a winning idea. Just tell them the wrong thing and it's :trophy:
 pb4: There's also a lot of value in having an idea of "what simple stuff works"
 MSmits: i get overcomplicated on my first few versions when i should just do some heuristics
 DomiKo: trying simple if's is so much fun
 MSmits: it's better to start on your full bot a bit later, when you know the game better
 MSmits: so you dont go down the wrong path and waste more time
 pb4: On this I disagree MSmits
 pb4: I hate writing something that I know I'll discard
 pb4: with a passion....
 MSmits: i do too
 pb4: Wood leagues are just a pain to me
 KalamariKing: But you can use ideas
 MSmits: pb4 depends on the game for me, i liked it in code a la mode
 MSmits: the wood leagues
 MSmits: you mainly just expand a list of recipes
 MSmits: in csb it's horrible, even the input structure changes
 MSmits: in HS it's bad too, because the map doesnt have the pillars at first
 MSmits: totally different game
 DomiKo: I would say that in every game you can escape wood's in less than 50 lines of code
 DomiKo: So is it that bad?
 MSmits: ocean of code 
 MSmits: not true for that game
 pb4: ^
 MSmits: you were forced to make your  wood  bot strong
 MSmits: or you wouldnt get out
 MSmits: i think they weakened boss later
 DomiKo: hmmm
 MSmits: i dont blame them, it's really hard to balance bot strength
 DomiKo: I believe that I got up with simple dfs
 DomiKo: but idk
 MSmits: sure, there's always ifs that work, but they're not always obvious
 MSmits: loads of people got stuck in ooc
 KalamariKing: ooc?
 MSmits: ocean of code
 KalamariKing: ah
 MSmits: the radar sub game
 MSmits: thingy
 Nerchio: well for people starting out "simple dfs" can take some time to get working
 MSmits: I think the hardest part in getting into the game is how the input/output thingy works
 MSmits: with the while loop and such
 inoryy: wow so we're sticking with starting the contest mid-day on Thursday&#160;:/
 MSmits: it's 11 days though
 MSmits: just starts a bit sooner than normal
 Nerchio: what's the problem with that? they probably want time to fix stuff on friday
 MSmits: still  ends on a monday
 MSmits: get 2 weekends
 Nerchio: and its different time of the day depending where you live&#160;;)
 Marchete: imo wood leagues should be skippable for veterans
 DomiKo: yeah
 Marchete: lower than final rules
 MSmits: well there's a point to that, but veterans barely need any time to get through them usually..
 inoryy: it's still annoying if your game plan is to get bronze top3 asap and disappear for the rest of the contest
 MSmits: so it's a small annoyance and sometimes it's nice.... 
 Marchete: annoying is the word
 aangairbender: and its kinda fun to beat those bosses
 aangairbender: and climb the leaderboard
 MSmits: yea
 Marchete: bronze top3 :rofl:
 MSmits: there's always someone that gets nr 1 and then suggests to end the contest early :P
 inoryy: hey I've been doing it for years!
 Marchete: I know
 Marchete: but I mean, there is little point to lvl 30+ or gold/legends  on previous contests to pass wood leagues
 Passifi: yo c++ coders if you do for(auto node&#160;: nodes) is node a copy of the object in nodes or a pointer to that object&#160;? 
 Marchete: esp. with game that rules change a lot
 aangairbender: today I practiced uttt and got gold 1 place, still boss was above me. it felt awkward 
 MSmits: Marchete sometimes it can help you ease into the game
 Marchete: for (auto node: 
 Marchete: yes
 pb4: copy
 MSmits: but often it's just annoying
 Marchete: for (auto&amp; node:
 Marchete: no
 Passifi: ahhh 
 inoryy: I'm just joking around Marchete, I agree with you if serious
 inoryy: but we both know it's not going to change
 Passifi: that explains the bug I was dealing with
 Passifi: thanks
 struct: Wood leagues are extremly hard this time&#160;;)
 aangairbender: switch to rust:joy:
 MSmits: personally, if given the option to skip wood, i may still just start in wood
 VizGhar: so many faces I haven't seen before :D why is that? :P
 Tiramon: contest starting today
 pb4: struct&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Regulars come out the woodwork around contest time
 MSmits: struct is spreading fake news
 pb4: Please tell us it's a joke&#160;:'(
 VizGhar: that was kinda rhetorical question
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Or is it...
 pb4: Were you one of the beta testers&#160;?
 struct: its a joke, easiest wood leagues I faced
 struct: Yes
 MSmits: still fake news :P
 VizGhar: he was... euler exposed him
 MSmits: or.. random news :P
 pb4: Good, few hours to pry secrets from you then :D
 aangairbender: bronze league should be open from the start, right?
 Tiramon: is it made by community or cg this time ... does anybody know?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: made by CG
 VizGhar: by CG
 MSmits: it's monday-wednesday-friday for silver-gold-legend opening
 Marchete: another grid game probably, with N agents
 LordSkaven:  print(rand.Next(0,10)); is that enough to get you past wood this time?
 Astrobytes: Social engineering doesn't seem to work on him pb4 :P
 pb4: Haha
 MSmits: did you try social reverse engineering Astrobytes&#160;?
 KalamariKing: MSmits they don't start opened?
 MSmits: wood and bronze do
 KalamariKing: But silver+ don't
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 KalamariKing: That's wack
 MSmits: but bronze has full rules
 MSmits: so it doesnt matter
 MSmits: you're  up against all the top players in bronze already
 LordSkaven: I thought silver was full rules?
 struct: I guess I can take a ss of bronze rules when I get there
 struct: It shouldnt take me much time 
 MSmits: only thing that changes from bronze to silver is that half the players are filtered out
 pb4: Yes please struct
 MSmits: so you get a smaller league
 MSmits: but same top players
 KalamariKing: how long do you think it'll take me to beat wood
 Marchete: 3.5
 MSmits: i dont know you 
 MSmits: so hard to say
 struct: I would say wood takes less than 20 minutes
 MSmits: for me it's between 2 hr and a day
 player_one: Wood always takes me more than 20 minutes.&#160;:-)
 struct: If they didnt change the boss
 RoboStac: so hard wood bosses that can be beaten in 20 minues?&#160;:)
 struct: Yes, they are on par with wood bosses from Bit runner&#160;:)
 MSmits: please no
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 RoboStac: ah good, I enjoyed those
 pb4: :evil:
 MSmits: I am ranked 10 or so in br2k and still not in the highest league :P
 Astrobytes: It was a refreshing change
 Nerchio: time to get some physical exercise before this thing starts see you soon guys :grinning:
 KalamariKing: glhf
 MSmits: good idea, ttyl
 LordSkaven: It is going to be a long 2 and  a half hours. I want to get started already
 inoryy: pretend it starts on Friday like it should've and then it will look early
 Marchete: holy f* nerchio is a Pro SC2 player
 inoryy: haha
 KalamariKing: yeah lol
 Astrobytes: Bit late to the party there Marchete :P
 Marchete: I'm late as always
 Marchete: 377k earnings according to wikipedia :D
 inoryy: I'm guessing ex-(pro player) would be more correct though?
 LordSkaven: with all his blizzcon money, he outsources his codingame stuff
 Marchete: and you play for a tshirt?
 Astrobytes: He got the bug.
 LordSkaven: that is the best tshirt in the world
 Marchete:&#160;:)
 LordSkaven: the tshirt is a physical manifestion of bragging rights
 inoryy: t-shirt you can't buy for money &gt; money
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 struct: I actually think thats the link
 Tiramon: but as my github repo it is private ... if it is the right link
 KalamariKing: for? thats a dead link
 Tiramon: private repos show up as 404
 struct: yes its private
 KalamariKing: oh lol
 Marchete: to not giving clues
 struct: omg, sharex makes wsl2 gui app crash
 struct: when i take a screenshot
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Marchete: windows have inbuilt app for screenshots
 Marchete: win+shift+S
 Marchete: also
 Tiramon: oh didn' t know that one ... still using snipping tool for screens&#160;;)
 LordSkaven: snipping tool is best tool
 Tiramon: yeah but i like builtin tools&#160;:)
 Marchete: I must confess I use it too
 Marchete: because I'm used to it
 Illedan: 2 hours. :zzz: 
 MADDY-1: hows your preparation for contest
 Illedan: New Project =&gt; Bite nails until it starts
 dreadylein:&#160;;)
 Illedan: Or byte nails
 LordSkaven: you still have your nails? Lucky fish
 LordSkaven: I started chewing mine when fall challenge ended
 Illedan: It compiles :tada:
 Astrobytes: Might change nick to Nailbytes
 BlaiseEbuth: Contest start at 16h&#160;? No respect for the people who work...
 casmith789: you have 11 days
 FredrikMetcalf: Cant find the information anywhere, but how do I write debug logs?
 Astrobytes: write to stderr
 FredrikMetcalf: Error? Ok, thought there was some debug output
 Illedan: casmith789, nah. We have 4 days. Then pb4 will be 1st for the rest of it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: And you can usually add something to the end of your output
 Astrobytes: lol, not wrong Ille
 casmith789: we all have a chance!
 BlaiseEbuth: lel
 Illedan: struct, do I need to prepare for N players? Or just 2? :D
 BlaiseEbuth: new&#160;?
 KiwiTae: and then Daporan will take over 10min before the end
 Illedan: Nah, price to low for dapo
 struct: I wont answer that Illedan Im sorry
 Illedan: Good&#160;:)
 Illedan: 2p it is then, thx
 KiwiTae: Illedan prepare both 
 BlaiseEbuth: No price -&gt; no dapo
 Illedan: I have 10 projects with various setups. Ready to delete all but 1 :P
 struct: lol
 struct: Do you have any 8 player project by any chance?
 Astrobytes: lmao
 Illedan: 2, 3 or N
 Illedan: Then Grid, Hex, physics, cardgame
 KalamariKing: wow
 KalamariKing: someone's prepared
 inoryy: 1-player FPS it is
 Illedan: jk :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Paranodan
 LordSkaven: what if they change the challenge to a flappy bird AI last second, are you prepared for that
 BlaiseEbuth: Or Illenoid?
 Astrobytes: Paradan
 Astrobytes: Illenoid was good though
 pb4: {2, 3, N}x{grid, hex, physics, cardgame}
 pb4: That's 12 combinations already
 pb4: Why only 8 projects&#160;?
 pb4: Prepare more&#160;!
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway this time I'm serious, so you can already all give up.
 inoryy: I'll just ask our AGI to figure out the most likely setup
 Illedan: I have a meta MCTS trying to solve the setup
 pb4: Anybody else from deepmind likely to participate&#160;?
 inoryy: Doubt it, pb4
 KalamariKing: wait is atomaton2000 down?
 Astrobytes: Hopefully.
 inoryy: AutomatonNN are you down?
 Astrobytes: That one is. Thankfully.
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 isn't autofilling
 Automaton2000: i don't know how the game is solved as a draw
 KalamariKing: what? bruv
 struct: also please dont spam automaton during contest
 Astrobytes: Alright, be back later, got some job applications to do
 struct: gl
 BlaiseEbuth: Who's from deepmind?
 KalamariKing: glhf, you got this
 struct: inory
 Redshirt: Is this chat specifically for Rugby Score game? or is it generic?
 struct: generic
 KalamariKing: this one? generic
 KalamariKing: wait when was a rugby score game in conversation
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't trust him, that's not written in his profile.
 Redshirt: it's not, I'm just on that game now
 KalamariKing: ah
 Redshirt: How would I get help on it? I'm getting the right output but it is still failing
 inoryy: BlaiseEbuth yep, unlike all the people that put "Google" as their company, them we can trust
 jacek: Redshirt do you print newline or whitespace
 BlaiseEbuth: Exactly! 
 Redshirt: Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2}", T, C, P);
 KalamariKing: Or is it in the validators
 Redshirt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/787fa40b-1f0d-4f89-9cc2-0ef6e3b960bb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/787fa40b-1f0d-4f89-9cc2-0ef6e3b960bb</a>

 RoboStac: sounds like you have the order wrong
 KalamariKing: There could be one too many or one too little of a line
 BlaiseEbuth: That's really strange to lie on his company... 
 Redshirt: ahh, yeah I see it now
 Redshirt: in the output requirements they specify the sorting required
 Redshirt: thanks
 KalamariKing: st
 KalamariKing: anyone wanna tell me what's going wrong? I've been looking at this for too long
 KalamariKing: It's the bender ep1 puzzle
 KalamariKing: Here's the bad code:

 KalamariKing: Yeah
 KalamariKing: I wanna learn something else but nrn
 KalamariKing: It fsr outputs a grid of only #s
 KalamariKing: '#'s
 KalamariKing: but why tho
 joniebear: When you use the [x]*n syntax, what you get is a list of n many x objects, but they're all references to the same object. 
 KalamariKing: Hmm
 KalamariKing: Thanks
 joniebear: try your grid definition in Python REPL and change one field, then look at the result&#160;:)
 NNGeorge: I want to learn html and coding him
 NNGeorge: (:)
 jacek: html, what kind of programming language is that
 BlaiseEbuth: Pony!
 KalamariKing: omg
 NNGeorge: )
 KalamariKing: joniebear thanks, fixed it
 derjack: where
 BlaiseEbuth: Another!
 KalamariKing: we're being overtaken
 BlaiseEbuth: Let's make lasagna!
 jacek: :thinking:
 inoryy: BlaiseEbuth what do you mean by "lie on his company"?
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, why someone will lie saying he's working for Google?
 jacek: we all work for google
 KalamariKing: we all make google money
 BlaiseEbuth: Chinese disagree
 inoryy: I think it's just a default choice for students? Doubt they're seriously trying to pretend they do
 inoryy: What's funny though is when CG is using Google's brand in their marketing without verifying if a single actual employee signed up, but I digress
 BlaiseEbuth: You're taking too seriously what was just a joke...
 inoryy: Nah, it just reminded me of an old subject
 jacek: *vietnam flashbacks*
 BlaiseEbuth: Since when CG verify its sources before using them to assert things?
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth cough cough 5% cough</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: I think D language would be a better comparison
 BlaiseEbuth: Better than?
 Zenoscave: Lol how many of the D lang folks stuck around?
 BlaiseEbuth: Was there any?
 Zenoscave: 1? 2? maybe
 MSmits: 'D' &gt; 'C'
 MSmits: evaluates to true, so...
 struct: c++ is almost there though
 Zenoscave: so do most alphanumeric chars... and in string world even more so if lexicographic ordering is used.
 struct: only if it was named ++c
 MSmits: good one struct&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Almost got my BFS search ready for what I'm hoping is a grid game. Or else yesterday was a waste
 Marchete: I pick 2
 Zenoscave: No grid?
 MSmits: you took a whole day to code a BFS?
 Marchete: it was a waste :D
 Nerchio: tbh i always open one of my old cg bots and copy BFS :joy:
 Zenoscave: Did you beta test Marchete
 Zenoscave: Not a whole day... just most of the time I had for projects
 MSmits: I always recode it from memory, depending on what the game map looks like
 Marchete: but BFS isn't usually used on search algos, no?
 MSmits: you can make it far more performant if you dont make it general
 BlaiseEbuth: You have only 5mins for projects&#160;?&#160;:/
 inoryy: I always start by writing my own OS from scratch
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 KalamariKing: I know that its a bandwidth thing, and cg won't let you, but is there a way to let cg show you the whole debug log instead of trimming the middle
 MSmits: lol
 Zenoscave: Yeah but I usually write the general case first and optimize from there MSmits
 MSmits: ah ok
 Zenoscave: Marchete. Please tell me you're only guessing
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 Zenoscave: Well. It's a 404 for me
 Zenoscave: but I'm guessing not you
 Marchete: oh, that's unfortunate
 Marchete: :rofl:
 inoryy: weird, I see the full src
 KalamariKing: Can you block someone
 BlaiseEbuth: Who KalamariKing
 MSmits: Zenoscave <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/0e3df86f0d">https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/0e3df86f0d</a>
 Marchete: how do you use BFS, Zenoscave?
 MSmits: can place walls, generate random maze and do bfs or dfs
 Marchete: inside a search algo?
 Marchete: maybe for lookups
 MSmits: screen.onkey(PathMode, 'p')screen.onkey(WallMode, 'w')screen.onkey(GenerateMaze, 'm')screen.onkey(ClearWalls, 'c')
 Marchete: but I can't recall using BFS
 Zenoscave: Naw for grid search
 Zenoscave: Probably should switch to a better path finding
 Westicles: Got to be 3D with all those trees to climb
 MSmits: Zenoscave there's no better pathfinding in CG than BFS
 MSmits: afaik
 Marchete: python?
 KalamariKing: BlaiseEbuth just want kitkat to stop followint me, idk
 KalamariKing: No msging, I just don't want them following me
 Astrobytes: Still bothering you?
 VizGhar: It's annoying person yes&#160;:|
 Astrobytes: I banned from World but it can still message and follow people
 MSmits: it?
 Westicles: he hangs out on #clash
 Zenoscave: it.
 BlaiseEbuth: Tibo said he gonna delete her account two days ago...
 Astrobytes: Not any more it doesn't
 Gabbek: Good day&#160;:)
 MSmits: hi Gabbek
 BlaiseEbuth: Why don't I ping?
 struct: astro you are lucky that my cpu is at 100%
 Gabbek: Nice to meet you, MSmits!
 MSmits: same
 struct: I had same idea&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: hellou
 struct: hi
 BlaiseEbuth: [CG]Thibaud&#160;!
 LordSkaven: struct, why are you torturing your cpu again?
 struct: for the contest
 struct: Im testing it
 MSmits: is there smoke coming out?
 LordSkaven: kind of last minute is it not? xD
 Zenoscave: Are you t-shirt elligble as a tester?
 struct: max temperature is 50ºC
 Zenoscave: asking for a friend...
 struct: no
 Zenoscave: Never gonna test then
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: this is why testers need to buy their own clothes
 Zenoscave: I NEED MY T-SHIRT
 tibithegreat: are we still gonna get the higher leagues in a few days after the start of the competition?
 Zenoscave: probably tibithegreat
 Gabbek: really nice link MSmits with maze/path finding, cool stuff&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: They haven't deviated from that ever afaik
 tibithegreat: I have time off this week and it would be nice if I got all the rules before I have to go back to work
 VizGhar: monday, wednesday, friday
 Astrobytes: If you don't have any Mega Man t-shirts with pewpewpew on them Zeno, then you are missing a trick here
 RoboStac: they try very hard to not introduce new rules with the leagues that open later
 tibithegreat: I see
 RoboStac: so bronze is open at the start and will be full rules unless there is something obviously wrong with them 
 Zenoscave: ... one sec gotta go find a t-shirt printing site 
 tibithegreat: RoboStac that's good
 Westicles: I think I have discovered the most boring thing in the world
 Astrobytes: Or just wear a Mega Man helmet all the time... :rofl:
 Zenoscave: Westicles what's that now?
 Gabbek: what is it, Westicles?
 Westicles: Watching streams of CoC in Haskell
 Zenoscave: this chat?
 BlaiseEbuth: Attack on JBM!
 Westicles: Nothing personal, of course!
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Gabbek: hmm, never tried that - I'm afraid of haskell :D
 Astrobytes: Watching streams of CoC in any language is pretty grim imo.
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 Astrobytes: Puzzles on the other hand.
 ZarthaxX: boring too
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Zenoscave: ^^^^
 ZarthaxX: CONTESTS THO
 Zenoscave: Boring also
 Astrobytes: I can watch puzzles and contests in Haskell.
 ZarthaxX: i would prefer to do it myself than watch it
 Zenoscave: Hi Zarthie
 Astrobytes: Are you volunteering?
 VizGhar: you can still go for chicks in bathtub trashtalking
 ZarthaxX: hi pewpewwwwwwwwwww
 Westicles: He gives them all 1 star, lol
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes for what?
 Gabbek: it depends I think, I would like to watch some puzzles some day - I've greatly enjoyed a session with EulerscheZahl about coders of the realm, learned so much!
 BlaiseEbuth: The interresting part
 Astrobytes: Streaming ZarthaxX :P
 ZarthaxX: ah...
 Gabbek: really enjoyed reCurse's stream one day tho :P
 MSmits: gabbek what do you mean a session?
 Zenoscave: I'll stream if i can get that pewpewpew shirt in time
 ZarthaxX: i cant stream with my internet
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 MSmits: did euler do a stream??
 Zenoscave: and better internet
 Astrobytes: Or a helmet Zenoscave
 ZarthaxX: cant do that in this country
 Zenoscave: Too expensive
 ZarthaxX: we can talk on discord tho :D
 Astrobytes: Make one
 Zenoscave: too much effort.
 Gabbek: MSmits not really - we were just on discord speaking, let's call it pair programming - but I was mostly learning&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Sad.
 Zenoscave: If it takes more use than typing. no thanks
 Astrobytes: Print one out! Then fold carefully.
 Zenoscave: ...
 Zenoscave: :thinking:
 Zenoscave: where to bu a printer...
 Zenoscave: buy*
 MSmits: ah yes, much of what i learned on CG, I learned from euler
 Astrobytes: Take a design to a 3D printer!
 ZarthaxX: the toad
 MSmits: sometimes from pm-ing for hours
 Zenoscave: the toad! To the toad
 Zenoscave: :beers:
 Astrobytes: Back to the Toad
 Gabbek: :beers:
 Astrobytes: Anyway, back shortly
 Zenoscave: OOH I need to make breakfast and coffee run thx for reminding me Astrobytes
 BlaiseEbuth: So you're the one responsible for the NN's "eulerscheZahl is there a way to..." MSmits&#160;?! :rage:
 Zenoscave: see you all at the stimer!!!
 MSmits: haha no, not me, but it could have been, if i joined CG later
 Gabbek: I'm hoping to make some small helpful projects with some starter code and other things, like replays downloader and maybe some game adaptations for people to play around a bit... but finishing anything is really hard when there's so many interesting things around&#160;:|
 Marchete: btw where is the toad?
 Zenoscave: automaton2000 where's euler?
 Automaton2000: after i get my bot to play the game and it was a thing
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't look at me, I don't ate him... :rolling_eyes:
 Gabbek: I'm guessing he's still working? Just a guess!
 Zenoscave: ping euler Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and there is a bug
 Zenoscave: oh yeah. food run brb
 struct: euler found out what the contest was and deleted
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: brew...
 Lachrymosa: Mern CG
 Zenoscave: moin
 MSmits: goedemorgen
 Gabbek: ohaio
 Lachrymosa: Dibs on the red critter :p
 MSmits: dibs on fat blue!
 Gabbek: dibs on acorn&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: WAIT NO
 KalamariKing: we're watching a movie in class, I might be missing for the contest start -_-
 BlaiseEbuth: dibs on dibs
 MSmits: KalamariKing there is more than enough time
 struct: no, you will need every second
 KalamariKing: MSmits but thats besides the point i wanna be part of the chat-spam-countdown
 Westicles: which movie?
 KalamariKing: gattaca
 MSmits: ah, i always turn that off KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: MSmits *scoff* boring
 MSmits: whats the thingy again, /?disableChat  right?
 Gabbek: aye
 struct: ?disableChat
 Gabbek: ?disableChat=true
 MSmits: dont think you need the =true
 BlaiseEbuth: Somebody put a link in the chat please. No matter what, be inventive.
 MSmits: if i am reading the game description, i get really distracted by the massive chat spam
 Gabbek: I'm sensing a trap... :D
 Westicles: that's quality teaching... you kids watch netflix while I do my taxes
 LordSkaven: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>

 MSmits: not sure that works
 MSmits: but change whatever your IDE link is, to that
 MSmits: with the /?disableChat thingy
 MSmits: there's a guy from my country that's registered as "DutchTeacher" and also goes to the same university

 MSmits: lol Westicles
 MSmits: is this a very elaborate prank or is this an actual puzzle&#160;?
 Westicles: That's a puzzle.  JBM is going to stream it later, says he is leaning towards 2 stars
 MSmits: that's more than 1&#160;!
 Westicles: well, the jury is still out
 VaseSimion: Hello people. Any place where I can find some info on this challenge before it starts?
 MSmits: it's a secret game until it starts
 MSmits: but you can check out other games
 MSmits: like the pacman game, which was also a spring challenge I believe?
 DeclanEgerton: Hey 
 VaseSimion: ok MSmits, thanks&#160;:) I forgot if it was fully secret or there was some info last itme
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 MSmits: sometimes they release some teaser thingy, but they didnt this time
 DeclanEgerton: Quick question, I'm VERY new to coding, just curious where I should start I'm wanting to learn Javascript
 MSmits: so we just have the art
 MSmits: and struct's fake news
 MSmits: DeclanEgerton maybe codecademy or other websites have some nice courses
 MSmits: you dont learn JS here, but after you know the basics you can apply it to puzzles
 MSmits: or you can learn python and enjoy the coding
 LordSkaven: Wiat,  this isnt going to be an 8 player flappy bird neural network challenge?
 KalamariKing: DeclanEgerton consider your options as well, there are plenty of languages each with their own nuances and applications
 MSmits: LordSkaven who knows, maybe&#160;:)
 VaseSimion: Declan, I learned Python here just by doing practice puzzles. got a task to do and the google how to write a solution I had in my mind
 MSmits: VaseSimion but maybe you already knew a language before that?
 DeclanEgerton: Okay so once I've learnt the basics elsewhere, this is a good place to practice
 DeclanEgerton: Oh right okay so I could learn Python here?
 MSmits: if you havent ever coded before i doubt you can learn python just from doing puzzles here
 MSmits: but if you know a different language already then it;s a good way
 DeclanEgerton: Makes sense
 MSmits: (its what i did)
 DeclanEgerton: I appreciate the support guys
 VaseSimion: True, you need to learn the logic behid (I knew that), how loops and conditions work at least
 DeclanEgerton: Ok, I'll see you all in a few weeks! :wink:
 aguillaume: DeclanEgerton 
 MSmits: yeah, computational thinking is a language independent skill
 VaseSimion: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">https://automatetheboringstuff.com/</a> this is an amazing place for python 
 VaseSimion: and it helps with generic thining also for programming
 KalamariKing: cg learn wasn't great for me tho, it didn't really help except for very specific and advanced use-cases
 MSmits: that might be useful for me too VaseSimion
 KalamariKing: when I was learning it did nothing for syntax, basics, etc
 KalamariKing: just a warning
 VaseSimion: I subscribe to Kalamari, codinggame learn section felt really hit or miss
 DeclanEgerton: I've had a look through the /learn section I noticed a lot of it was in foreign languages which unfortunately I didn't understand
 MSmits: yeah it's not the easiest way to learn 
 DeclanEgerton: The sections did seem very specific too rather than a generic beginner style
 MSmits: maybe just do a dedicated basic programming course
 KalamariKing: Exactly
 AntiSquid: isn't the foreign language stuff all just translated tutorials from elsewhere&#160;?
 Gabbek: sorry, I was eating -- DeclanEgerton you can also try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/">https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/</a>
 KalamariKing: 45min y'all ready
 Gabbek: not sponsored or anything, I just think it's an amazing learning platform&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: Gabbek how much do you payt for that?
 AntiSquid: or how much do they pay you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: KalamariKing i lost the link to that picture
 DeclanEgerton: jetbrains looks good, they seem to offer added free time for completing the first assignments too that's a good incentive for sure
 VaseSimion: Just find some course you feel you like until you learn how loops, variables and conditions work. After that this is a great place to test your problem solving skills and improve them. Here you learn a lot by doing, but the basics you need to learn outside (like MSmits suggested )
 Gabbek: you can get like 3-4 months for free if you do a bit of work on it and get a referral link
 aguillaume: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript</a> this is also a good starting point. people I know liked using it
 AntiSquid: i hate codecademy
 DeclanEgerton: While I've got you guys here that seems to know what you're doing
 ZarthaxX: why
 aguillaume: :joy:
 AntiSquid: also that tutorial is way below freecodecamp aguillaume
 DeclanEgerton: I'm looking to career change and completely go head first into software development 
 DeclanEgerton: What language would you learn first in my position
 MSmits: the html/css course on codecademy is good at least. I had some students do it and they just breeze through
 AntiSquid: why i hate codecademy ZarthaxX&#160;? bugs, lots of bugs, slow, it's ok content wise but didn't do much for me
 DeclanEgerton: I know basic HTML
 DeclanEgerton: I'm currently using MIMO which is really good I've learnt quite a lot from this app
 KalamariKing: DeclanEgerton depends. Some software dev paths go for low-level like c++, others something like java or python even
 VaseSimion: If you want to save your sanity do not go for C and embedded C. 
 DeclanEgerton: It's great because I can code on my break at work via mobile
 DeclanEgerton: I'm considering javascript/python
 AntiSquid: i remember pages freezing on me for no god damn reason on codecademy or some puzzle not passing for hell knows what reason but my solution was correct
 KalamariKing: while I see less of it here, I know python is used a lot in data science
 MSmits: AntiSquid I guess they had some courses with bugs
 MSmits: the ones i did were mostly ok
 AntiSquid: like 50% of them or at least the ones i wanted to try out
 MSmits: when i just started learning, i did everything i could find on codecademy
 KalamariKing: python is more 'fluid', and java is more structured, if that makes sense (implicit types --&gt; harder to accidentally assign wrong val)
 DeclanEgerton: You'd think a website as popular as that would be squashing bugs ASAP
 AntiSquid: this was years ago, but memory is very alive MSmits
 MSmits: also ruby, python js, sql etc,.
 Gabbek: DeclanEgerton I would suggest doing some market research - what kind of languages are the most popular for something you would like to do.
 aguillaume: lol fair enough. not seen freecodecamp before, but seems like a good resource as well. I learned a lot from code school... but its no longer a thing&#160;:( it got taken over by pluralsight and its much worse now
 KalamariKing: I prefer java/cpp for fast execution, python for fast/short code, you decide what you want to do
 AntiSquid: aguillaume freecodecamp is massive compared to codecademy if you're just looking for JS 
 inoryy: data science is split between R and Python, but for ML Python is king yes
 AntiSquid: not sure about the people there today, but they were very skilled and knowledgeable years ago
 DeclanEgerton: I've had a nosey at some apprenticeships too and they all train you in javascript, that seems to be the most "in demand" for big employers for sure
 MSmits: DeclanEgerton depends on what you're going to do at these big employers
 inoryy: and depends what do you mean by "big"
 MSmits: different jobs require different languages
 DeclanEgerton: big being corporate like COOP autotrader etc
 AntiSquid: even if you say big employers, i'm sure you got it all wrong, since not everyone in every god damn department needs to know JS :D
 DeclanEgerton: btw I appreciate all the links you have given me I've made note of them all
 Zenoscave: My team uses everything from java to c# to TS
 MSmits: teamspeak? Gaming at work huh?
 inoryy: badumtss
 Zenoscave: Typescript&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: typeshit
 aguillaume: I've had people come from coding apprentiships. people find it a bit hit and miss.. but JS is their language of choice because you can do front end, backend and database all with one language. So it lowers the entry bar. 
 inoryy: or should I say badum.ts
 DeclanEgerton: I think, as a complete beginner if I focus on mastering JS as much as I can and then move into other languages more focused on what I want to do career-wise
 KalamariKing: That sounds like a good plan
 KalamariKing: 18sec coc letsgo
 inoryy: yes, that is a sound plan DeclanEgerton
 AntiSquid: i think it depends what you want to do, you can stick to JS not an issue
 Zenoscave: But learning more languages (after getting a grip on one) isn't an issue either. Solid plan all around
 DeclanEgerton: Front end or back end software development is the goal at the moment
 AntiSquid: came to wet your toes in the contest inoryy or are you doing it for real&#160;?
 DeclanEgerton: but I'm sure as my knowledge grows I could change paths
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.thisisalink.com">https://www.thisisalink.com</a>
 Zenoscave: DeclanEgerton you've got the right idea there
 KalamariKing: blaise why did I get a privacy err
 inoryy: AntiSquid I'll probably do the usual unless it really pulls me in
 Zenoscave: Because they used the wrong cert for the domain KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: Zenoscave do they also own .parkingcrew.net? That's where the cert is from
 KalamariKing: Oh lmao its 'buy this domain'
 Zenoscave: I'm guessing but the net runs to a domain monetizing .com
 Zenoscave: BlaiseEbuth What is that all about
 Zenoscave: Did I fall for overt clickbait
 KalamariKing: lmao i think we did
 Lachrymosa: 30 minutes from now
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm re-making my chat client, and I need it to open links in the browser. So I need links to test

 Zenoscave: Self bump of old blog I forgot to update
 Tiramon: you need more content for that blog Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: absolutely. When I remember to have content 
 Zenoscave: wait what was I forgetting now?
 Lachrymosa: to be content
 Zenoscave: ^^^
 gigolo: have fun&#160;:)
 Tiramon: fun will start in 26min&#160;;)
 Tiramon: if they are not late ...
 gigolo:&#160;:)
 ANJACE_Z: What will happen in 26 min?
 AntiSquid: fun starts when you celebrate
 AntiSquid: ANJACE_Z it's when clash of coders will complain their clash is slow and ignore the fact that there's a contest going on
 Tiramon: :thumbsup:
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid every contest ...
 Tiramon: any guess how long it will take this time to slow the page down enough?
 Zenoscave: 30 min
 AntiSquid: is it me or aren't that many signed up this time?
 MSmits: uh 12k?
 Gabbek: think it was 16k last time?
 Zenoscave: I'm not sure of the final number before start.
 AntiSquid: 17k last time
 AntiSquid: nvm i thought it was closer to 20k
 ANJACE_Z: What happens in a contest?
 ANJACE_Z: this is my first time
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 Lachrymosa: contestants compete
 AntiSquid: here you go btw
 alopikon: 17 k at the end of the contest*
 AntiSquid: just so you have the link at least
 Zenoscave: It's like a multiplayer but leagues open every couple of days.
 Zenoscave: Multiplayers are finished/previous contests mostly
 Lachrymosa: Euler has been busy and introduced a few non-contest multiplayers though :3
 Tiramon: same as with most bot games ANJACE_Z but you just have limited time
 Zenoscave: 11 days
 ANJACE_Z: Tiramon by limited time u mean?
 Tiramon: as zeno said 11 days
 Tiramon: starting in about 19 mins
 gigolo: today is the day :heart_eyes: 
 AntiSquid: how long will it take till someone spots a bug and complains&#160;: "i can't do x command properly on turn  t"
 Tiramon: 1h i guess
 Tiramon: will only hapen in bronze and up i hope&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: tiraman were you a tester&#160;?
 Tiramon: no
 Lachrymosa: Does CG still send out nifty T-shirts?
 Tiramon: even missed the last contest&#160;:(
 gigolo: what is the most used language&#160;? and the lowest can i see from previous contests&#160;?
 AntiSquid: C++ most used
 Marchete: not really
 BlaiseEbuth: Tiramon where do you get that badge
 Marchete: I'd say python or JS
 AntiSquid: at the top
 Tiramon: gigolo filter and have fun<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global</a>
 gigolo: :kissing_heart:
 MSmits: c++ is most used by top players because in some cases it gives an advantage
 MSmits: so they are used to it
 Tiramon: what badge?
 Marchete: by top players&#160;!= most used
 MSmits: right
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't count wood bots since they quit too fast
 AntiSquid: last contest 4k in wood 
 BlaiseEbuth: The moderator one, :eyes:
 MSmits: also if you count most used by time spent coding with the language, then it's c++
 Tiramon: also c++ only gives some advantages if you know how to use it&#160;;)
 Marchete: ok, adding imaginary rules, you are ready to blame about language times and codegolf
 Tiramon: Blaise i'm moderator for i guess 5 years ...
 AntiSquid: i thought we talk about contest 
 Tiramon: because thibaud asked me&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. You were absent for a long time...
 Marchete: are you sure Tiramon? I never saw you on chat before...
 BlaiseEbuth: Same
 Tiramon: :P
 Marchete: :kissing_smiling_eyes:
 Esdeathmylove: lol
 MSmits: who is this Tiramon
 AntiSquid: it's not an imaginary rule though i doubt 4k people are stuck in wood, i am sure they simply quit early on, so ...
 Esdeathmylove: why u all are drunk already?
 inoryy: you could say anyone below #1 quit too early
 Tiramon: as always AntiSquid
 Marchete: they are players nevertheless
 MSmits: yes but Marchete, do you count by players using the language or time spent coding
 Marchete: ahh good question
 MSmits: if the 2nd, then it's c++ for sure
 Zenoscave: oh god chat scrolled
 Marchete: most used as bot count by language
 AntiSquid: Esdeathmylove i dropped that manga halfway through, i tried ... but it's not good enough
 MSmits: then it's not c++ i guess
 Marchete: it's the only measure we can do
 inoryy: how about total lines of code written
 MSmits: then still c++
 Zenoscave: Or my c#...
 Zenoscave: I'm a little verbose
 Marchete: total lines? Java and then C#
 Lachrymosa: Count by characters used modulo i where i is ascending numbers in the fibbonaci sequence correlated to a lookup that determines which language gets which order in the sequence. Thems the rules.
 AntiSquid: so do we count all players that submit default code and count it as participation&#160;?
 Marchete: yes
 AntiSquid: what if all default submits are D-lang for fun&#160;?
 Zenoscave: I submit the default code immediately usualy
 gmessier: Last contest 1.Python 2.C++ 3.Java 4.C#
 inoryy: nice, python number one
 Lachrymosa: snek
 MSmits: thats why i think if you count lines it's C++
 MSmits: because it takes way more lines to do the same thing in C++
 MSmits: also top players write more lines
 AntiSquid: java 3rd and above c#&#160;? what is wrong with the world?
 MSmits: than average
 inoryy: can't outrun the snake
 Lachrymosa: the ++ stands for how many extra lines there are
 Lachrymosa: it just keeps adding
 inoryy: lol Lachrymosa
 Zenoscave: then C++++ is more
 Marchete: C# have 4 +
 Zenoscave: the # is really 4 +'s
 ANJACE_Z: ur ranks r very good
 Marchete: I win
 inoryy: haha
 Zenoscave: look up. I said C++++ before you
 Marchete: C# is not c++++
 ANJACE_Z: c#=c+++bash
 Zenoscave: But the # == 4 +'s i thought
 AntiSquid: it's 4th
 jke: no server issues this year? 🤞
 inoryy: c# is java++ so only 2 +'s
 Zenoscave: It isn't J
 AntiSquid: haha
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_J_Sharp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_J_Sharp</a>
 Lachrymosa: But with # it hides them in a better bundle so on the surface it doesn't take up as much space as ++++. C++ isn't as wrapped up so it "looks" bigger but C# probably has more happening in the backside (Don't shoot, I'm just a boy)
 Zenoscave: Lachrymosa I'm stealing that for lectures next semster
 orangesnowfox: hiiii
 Lachrymosa: Noice :D
 Gabbek: hi, hi
 fredrik_lundq: whats up?
 Lachrymosa: I've always thought I'd like to "retire" by being a professor at a junior college or something
 AntiSquid: how about a C[+]+&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Lol I'm far from that stage
 Gabbek: You're a teacher, Zenoscave?
 Marchete: ++C is faster
 Zenoscave: Student lectern
 Marchete: or I've heard
 inoryy: haha being a prof is farthest from retiring
 Thiesjoo: :hand_splayed:
 Zenoscave: only if it's reference&#160;;)
 Gabbek: *googles lectern word* :P
 Lachrymosa: thats why retire was in quotes lol, my wife is an ESL prof. so i know it's work. 
 Zenoscave: *google lectern to make sure i didn't use the wrong word again*
 Zenoscave: Lecturer***
 Gabbek: cool stuff!
 ANJACE_Z: i thought lectern=lecturer+intern
 Lachrymosa: I just can't make the kind of money I want in teaching without being extremely competitive in it, so I'd rather rack up some retirement revenue and then teach for the love of it comfortably
 AntiSquid: ya was wondering if it's some new "trendy" wording for a job title
 araba1000: E
 Zenoscave: Nah just a podium. I confuse words a lot
 KalamariKing: yall ready? 5 minnutes
 Lachrymosa: 7:28 for me
 orangesnowfox: 7.5 actually
 ANJACE_Z: 7.18
 Zenoscave: Every time... We all know the start changes in countdown
 gigolo: 7
 Zenoscave: 15 seconds to go and the chat will scroll like a gregorian monk
 KalamariKing: oh 9 minutes, sorry
 MSmits: mmh not sure that expression makes sense
 Lachrymosa: complete with whacking of foreheads
 Zenoscave: gregorian monks wrote lots of scrolls. It was a reach
 MSmits: do gregorian monks read scrolls?
 MSmits: ohh 
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: go tit
 MSmits: got it
 Zenoscave: who's tit?
 Scarfield: xD
 Lachrymosa: tat's brother
 AntiSquid: scam caller might ring the phone when contest starts, so better make sure it's off
 MSmits: lol
 Zenoscave: quick someone ping euler so he knows not to miss it
 Esdeathmylove: drink more
 Esdeathmylove: dream more
 Lachrymosa: @eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: AntiSquid what if they have information that your computer is compromised
 Lachrymosa: :D
 AntiSquid: eulerscheZahl
 jrke: 5 mins to go
 Zenoscave: I FORGOT TO GET FOOD
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: you dont want to start the contest with a hacked computer
 orangesnowfox: eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 MSmits: and they can fix it for you
 Zenoscave: euler I'm sorry for bringing on the pings
 Tiramon: at least you might survive til tomorrow this way zeno
 Lachrymosa: all hail HypnoToad
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl is here just in time?&gt;
 AntiSquid: will first run a few batch games to see if it's compromised by a sentient AI MSmits
 kovi: smurfs are ready?
 MSmits: good idea
 yhyoxx: pff
 AntiSquid: and ask them to call later
 Zenoscave: wait smurfs can contest?
 Zenoscave: Is that allowed even?
 yhyoxx: smurfs should be banned
 Illedan: Gl hf
 Gabbek: Nerchio you'll have "CodinGame" in your profile when you'll be streaming?
 maddenvvs: Good luck to all of you!
 Nerchio: why not
 Lachrymosa: just have them navigate a call tree that is actually a maze, if they can get out of it it rings your phone
 Zenoscave: GL HF!!! Illedan I'm still reaching for C# first so watch out
 jrke: do i have to refresh page after the timer gets to 00
 jrke:&#160;?
 Illedan: No
 Illedan: There is modern tech on CG doing it
 MSmits: no jrke you just keep looking at it till monday 17 :P

 eXodiquas: When is Lisp coming to town?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: damn, the chat is killing Chromium again
 eulerscheZahl: and firefox extremely laggy as well
 Illedan: Already posted a bug
 AntiSquid: remember to all submit at once when contest starts, it makes the server flow faster 
 MSmits: euler /?disableChat
 MSmits: that's what i am doing
 eulerscheZahl: i think so
 Lachrymosa: waffle stomping code into the server like a boss
 KalamariKing: 6 minutes :eyes:
 putibuzu: Nerchio = SC2 Nerchio?
 struct: yes
 Zenoscave: STOP SCROLLING I can't ^C/^v
 Astrobytes: wtf, chat is fked

 AntiSquid: yes ask him to play sc with you putibuzu
 orangesnowfox: idk what you're all talking about, chat is fine lol
 Astrobytes: scroll-ololl-ololl

 Tiramon: [CG]Thibaud you broke it ...
 ANJACE_Z: guyz i won
 MSmits: something is
 ANJACE_Z: i pressed back to home xD
 eXodiquas: And the moral of the story is: It's the gateway in our heart which counts.
 spiralpinata: network error, status 504
 AntiSquid: 1st BUG ALREADY&#160;!! xaxaxax
 spiralpinata: wtf is that
 Marchete: ohh community starter
 AntiSquid: haha starters but none for c++
 Westicles: hex!
 MSmits: python js and java
 d34db33f_bot: @spiralpinata, the same
 Tiramon: ok you guessed 30min until it breaks the site ... nobody expected 5s&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: there even is one for java
 AntiSquid: typical
 Bashar: 504 anyone?
 youdontknowme: me too
 MSmits: everyone&#160;:)
 Marchete: stop DDOSing!
 DimSumSaying: 504....lol
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: me too
 Westicles: The game takes place in a forest, in which gentle wood spirits reside. Their job is to make sure trees complete their lifecycle. 
 Marchete: who cares? you have the referee
 ANJACE_Z: i cant see  the spring challenge after reloading
 MSmits: but AntiSquid said we all have to submit
 KAbel: 504
 Adidinamite: guys how much time do i have for this condingame spring challenge
 Allsimon: 502, 504
 spiralpinata: is it a ddos attack
 Piemert: Can I use Qbasic as my preferred language this season?
 E_pur_si_muove: we caused that DDoS&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Adidinamite Less than 11 days
 MSmits: Adidinamite 11 days minus the time it takes before its fixed :P
 Adidinamite: thanks you so much
 [CG]jupoulton2: I'm told the servers will scale up and should stabilize soon enough
 MSmits: ah i am in finally
 Zenoscave: I win MSmits
 MSmits: turning chat off, ttyl :0
 AntiSquid: MSmits ya idk, thought they'd have more server capacity ready for contests after these many years :D
 eulerscheZahl: shall I trust the staff member that doesn't even get his own avatar loaded?
 AntiSquid: all submit to stress test, we got to make sure the servers don't die mid contest, that would be a pity
 eulerscheZahl: oh, now i see the avatar
 Lachrymosa: Don't wanna pay for what you don't need, just let it scale up on it's own even if theres a delay
 AntiSquid: that's jup's alt, not sure why he has one though
 LordSkaven: where can I check the language versions we can use?
 orangesnowfox: "wait, you all can submit?"
 DaNinja: hexagons?!
 eulerscheZahl: LordSkaven <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>

 ANJACE_Z: totoboss is pretty strong
 AlPaca: hmm
 AlPaca: problems with connectivity?
 AlPaca: can't even ping codingame.com
 ChemyR: me too
 struct: Marchete and ZarthaxX it fits easily in a bitboard
 ZarthaxX: i know
 ZarthaxX: i was gonna do that lol
 Marchete: I'm 504 a bit more

 ZarthaxX: its better to leave cg for a bit to stabilize right?
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 Narutofan1: Im 9
 MSmits: lol...
 ZarthaxX: MSmits you better get 1st place
 Astrobytes: My IDE loaded in D and every time I try to change it to C++ I get a 504 :rofl:
 MSmits: we'll see what the game looks like from bronze
 Thiesjoo: Slow and steady wins the race (:
 d34db33f_bot: --- codingame.com ping statistics ---1024 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss
 MSmits: might be more complex

 aCat: all leagues upload
 jrke: lol players' submission ended before boss in wood 1
 Thiesjoo: Is bronze already open?
 KiwiTae: Marchete illedan had his bot ready for any games
 inoryy: W1 boss still not out?
 Scarfield: yes, silver opens up the 10th, click on league next to the countdown and your rank
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someone post a replay.  Just got here.
 Dr-D: Wood league was never named better =D
 struct: inoryy I think its stuck
 Tiramon: ok so lets see how long promotion takes
 jrke: stucked due lots of battle
 jrke: wood1 boss is currently computing
 Narutofan1: bad
 inoryy: struct huh, didn't realize they submitted W1 boss as well
 Narutofan1: im laptop
 gigolo: yay promoted
 gigolo: :heart_eyes:
 struct: yeah but is stuck in 11%&#160;:/
 Tiramon: You now have the ability to make trees GROW!
 gigolo: yes
 Piemert:                 if (i == numberOfPossibleMoves - 1)
 Narutofan1: im bad at programing
 KalamariKing: lol same
 Tiramon: no i made a sort on trees and cells
 orangesnowfox: You're all submitting already? :p
 plopy23: join Cfm-Team
 plopy23: arf…
 jrke: boss still at 11% like 10 mins ago
 Marchete: why does it take that long?
 Scarfield: already 300 players submitted

 Marchete: but the boss takes much longer than others
 Thiesjoo: Are bronze promotions not working?
 Scarfield: i suppose its because the boss has not finished (?)
 Thiesjoo: All my battles are marked as complete
 jrke: yes
 jrke: thiesjoo but boss's battles not completed
 Thiesjoo: Oh wiat the boss battles
 Thiesjoo: ah nvm
 jrke: my battles are also completed and i am above boss but still...
 Marchete: until the boss ends
 Marchete: time to know what's this game about
 jrke: ^+1
 struct: I think they are checking the boss
 struct: at least I reported it
 jrke: checking what?
 eulerscheZahl: hey struct when #1?
 struct: when bronze opens
 jrke: and 100% winrate
 jrke:&#160;;)
 jrke: oke boss is so lazy so, i am going to have break and then dinner to get back to coding
 jrke: bye
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, how can I get the input of a NxM 2d array from a file, in C
 Narutofan1: :expressionless:
 TheBatMan_TM: what's the spring challenge?
 ANJACE_Z: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 TheBatMan_TM: no i mean what is it for?
 Marchete: something related to shadows?
 TheBatMan_TM:&#160;?
 Uljahn: online competition for 11 days
 Dr-D: It is for fun?
 Marchete: like if you have a bigger tree others won't grow?
 Scarfield: no idea, but the yellow arrows in the replays i suppose is the sunlight direction
 Narutofan1: what is Bash
 Dr-D: Very good idea @ scarfield
 Marchete: sun-&gt;big tree-&gt;small tree (no grow)
 Dr-D: Makes totally sense
 Scarfield: probably marche
 Narutofan1: wht is c++
 orangesnowfox: wow, 55 better than the wood 2 boss all of a sudden
 Gabbek: seems like direction matters; perhaps blocking later on?
 Narutofan1: what is go
 Scarfield: maybe you cant plant on a cell with a shadow, lets see
 Gabbek: I'm happier than with potions, guess I'm a tree guy&#160;:)
 Marchete: what is what
 Marchete: line directions on hex....
 Scarfield: im ok with line directions, but the indexing is going to be a pain i think
 Marchete: at least is just 2 players
 JormaW: Hoooly moly this spring challenge game is a doozy
 KalamariKing: Are you all doing a 2d array with shifted rows or a 3d hex rep
 Uljahn: yes
 Scarfield: bitboard i think
 struct: boss is moving
 struct: nice
 orangesnowfox: Currently? I'm doing a 1d array with precomputed neighbors (read: the way they give it to you)
 struct: All I did was bitboard
 struct: easier than grid
 Waffle3z: getting a warning that my code didn't read all available input before printing. pretty sure it did though
 Lachrymosa: don't print your action within the for loops that are reading in the inputs
 Scarfield: outputting twice in same turn?
 Waffle3z: oh yeah I'm printing multiple times
 jacek: noob
 Scarfield: lol
 Waffle3z: it works though
 LordSkaven: one line of logic to beat wood 1 interesting
 struct: jacek will you play since its a board game?
 Marchete: extra rules available in higher leagues are:Choose where to plant trees, trees will also cast shadows on neighbouring trees.
 AntiSquid: this gardening business getting out of hand
 Beresta: full ruleset is in bronze or later?
 struct: also more rounds = total 24
 jacek: struct maybe. its even hex!
 Marchete: bronze, and in github
 eulerscheZahl: you can already see the sun at the edges moving around
 eulerscheZahl: bronze = final rules
 Marchete: 100ms per turn
 AntiSquid: in legend you need to chop the trees and make a computer desk out of it Beresta
 ZarthaxX: 100ms :OOOO
 Beresta: :D
 Marchete: you need to arm an IKEA shrondenfurl
 ZarthaxX: first time they put 100ms for a contest? :thinking:
 JormaW: How much programming knowledge would you say this spring challenge needs? Because im really lost and im not sure if its at all possible for me
 itzluku: why do print cmds dont show an output ?_?
 eulerscheZahl: do you remeber my contest prediction? 68c9c0f65e242d686fe26fffc1a830ad7451a2ae4238a9d3f30e0d913e4b2b6csee <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2021-04-08">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2021-04-08</a>

 Uljahn: itzluku: are you printing wait?
 aCat: JormaW seems you can go pretty fur just with if-ology&#160;;-)
 Lachrymosa: itzluku are you sending the print to an err stream?
 Marchete: too suspicious euler
 Marchete: as usual
 itzluku: im printing a dictionary with possible moves
 JormaW: Okay.. But like am i supposed to start by analyzing that 100+ lines of code from github?
 itzluku: there are inputs u get, think the name was possible_move
 LegendKrazy: any idea why the game viewer might be greyed out for me?
 aCat: just read the statement lol&#160;;]
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, how did you guess it?
 eulerscheZahl: try with addons disabled
 eulerscheZahl: and activate or deactivate hardware acceleration
 eulerscheZahl: magic dbdr
 dbdr: ezpz
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 jacek: wait, w00t? they give you possible moves?
 Gabbek: aye, to make it more accessible
 struct: yes jacek
 Beresta: yea, wood 1 is just printing last possible move :D 
 zasmu: when is bronze opening&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: when boss is at 100%
 eulerscheZahl: 86% done
 AntiSquid: when the sun shines bright
 itzluku: ah u have to do print("WAIT"+xyz)
 itzluku: lol
 MrFruit: I accidently created a pretty good bot in Spring Challenge lol
 MrFruit: ...for wood 2 league
 ZarthaxX: toad did you find a replay of this game before contest? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Hjax: euler read structs mind actually
 Hjax: thats the secret
 eulerscheZahl: that was in April, before struct was testing
 eulerscheZahl: early April*
 struct: 86%, come on, I want to be first for a sec&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: first or delete
 Hjax: imagine if struct submitted and wasnt first
 jacek: so who created the amazons?
 zahariaca: what was the command to shout something?
 Thiesjoo: Promoted!
 eulerscheZahl: yay
 Tiramon:  WAIT &lt;message&gt;
 ZarthaxX: oh so struct tested 1 month before contest??
 struct: not 1 month
 eulerscheZahl: no, i made my guess before struct tested
 eulerscheZahl: so he didn't have the chance to leak that guess to me
 Hjax: bronze is opening

 struct: 16/04 ZarthaxX
 Lachrymosa: Bronze here I come!
 Tiramon: why does it end at Round 5/23
 struct: wood 1 rule
 ZarthaxX: struct oh thats not much..
 ZarthaxX: thought they tested it way before that
 Tiramon: oh there ... For this league, the game lasts the time it takes for the sun to circle around the board 1 time. This means players have 6 days to play.
 AntiSquid: screenshot time ladder shuffling :o
 struct: cg probably did
 ZarthaxX: then why they need others mhm
 AntiSquid: 1st
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid gz :P
 AntiSquid: done, i can stop playing
 ZarthaxX: END THE CONTEST NOW
 why_anonymous: how to use sun point
 Marchete: top10, end it now :D
 Illedan: Gimme 30 min before sim is done
 emh: I plant I grow I win. veni vidi vici
 Illedan: Hi em
 Marchete: do you have a working sim in 1 hour?
 emh: Hi Illedan
 ZarthaxX: he is crazy lol
 struct: please no Illedan
 struct: Let me have my 10 minutes of fame
 Illedan: Game is super easy?
 ZarthaxX: hai illooo&#160;:*
 Tiramon: before i start to build a sim i want bronze rules first&#160;;)
 Marchete: me too
 Illedan: ahhhh, I have. togo eat dinner -.-
 Illedan: but THEN
 Illedan: I need to code somethign with the sim too :D
 AntiSquid: you have dessert
 Tiramon: atleast it seems that i handled wood 1 now
 Nerchio: silver doesn't come out today right
 Nerchio: its on monday or smth
 DomiKo: top5 end end end
 Gabbek: Nerchio think it's only bronze for 2-3 days
 ZarthaxX: yep Nerchio
 struct: not yet, hold on a few more minutes
 AntiSquid: 1st end it .
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid 1st again nice
 struct: not for long
 AntiSquid: what's my prize anyway?
 ZarthaxX: struct submitted the killer?
 Tiramon:  ascreenshot of you beeing first ... if you are fast enough
 struct: I submited my best version I think yes
 AntiSquid: canvas and shirts i see#
 Marchete: and ended 15th bronze :D
 Tiramon: damn i fogot how long it takes to stabilize ranking on contest start days
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot what contests are
 eulerscheZahl: 2 a year is too less to remember
 Tiramon: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: spooky
 AntiSquid: way too few i guess, but can suplement with awesome contests like gocoder
 Piols: do sun points go over to the next day? 
 Marchete: spooky = cast.size &gt;= other.size
 Marchete: I don't see a lot of BFS 
 AntiSquid: time to read statement
 struct: I hope my bot can make it to silver
 Marchete: this damn game is perfect for Smits and his sexy bitboards
 MrFruit: I keep getting tying
 Waffle3z: anyone else only winning or drawing and never losing?
 MrFruit: 5 ties in a row
 struct: even I did bitboards and never did them before besides uttt
 Waffle3z: is wood 1 solved?
 AntiSquid: Marchete, must be how he picked up his girlfriend
 Marchete: there are bitboards and bitboards
 AntiSquid: showing her the bitboards
 struct: Waffle3z me :p
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: well packed bitboards
 Tiramon: boss is at rank 173 atm .. guess yes Waffle3z
 darkhorse64: titboards
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MrFruit:&#160;??
 stefan-gg: for some reason i cannot harvest size 3 tree did anoybody had the same problem i code in java&#160;?
 TheBatMan_TM: how do i run a flask app (site) in repl.it?
 Gabbek: stefan-gg you can't if it's dormant
 AntiSquid: a single long long int
 TheBatMan_TM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://replit.com/@kaushikkalesh/Online-Notes">https://replit.com/@kaushikkalesh/Online-Notes</a>
 MACKEYTH: Do you have enough sun points, stefan-gg?
 struct: stefan-gg maybe you didnt have enough suns?
 MACKEYTH: Are you sure it's your tree?
 TheBatMan_TM: AntiSquid moved up to 9th huh? 
 stefan-gg: it stays dormant just for 1 turn right? yes i had enough sun and im sure its my tree bcs i use isMine bool
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Ok got my basic BFS ready for the game in Hex, have my basic layout ready. time for bronze soon I hope
 MACKEYTH: I hope there aren't any huge changes in mechanics between leagues
 ZarthaxX: why bfs
 ZarthaxX: are u crazy :D
 Marchete: BFS for what?
 ZarthaxX: wtf LOL
 Zenoscave: No idea. 
 Marchete: ok
 ZarthaxX: it wont help
 AntiSquid: TheBatMan_TM huh?
 Zenoscave: is pathfinding not needed?
 Beresta: for bronze you need just a super simple logic as usual :D 
 struct: nope
 MrFruit: How is path finding going to help...?
 Marchete: f both players send a seed to the same place on the same turn, neither seed is planted and the sun points are refunded. The source tree, however, still becomes dormant.
 TheBatMan_TM: AntiSquid, your global rank is 9 now right? u were 11 earlier
 AntiSquid: use A*
 Zenoscave: no idea. Just assumed because grid
 AntiSquid: earlier when? :P
 inoryy: don't listen to them Zenoscave they're just haters
 oneToBeReadyTwoToBeSteadyGo: How do you move to bronze?
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave F
 Zenoscave: Not sure whose the troll here
 MrFruit: You have to be number 1 I assume
 Waffle3z: now I'm 9th
 TheBatMan_TM: the last time i checked :p
 MSmits: pathfinding for trees?
 Zenoscave: I'll keep it til bronze
 RoboStac: yeah, how would you know the best route to move your tree without pathfinding?
 LordSkaven: I went crazy and did 6 lines of logic to get out of wood
 Tiramon: grow richest tree possible and start completing them in time
 Marchete: Growing a seed into a size Y-1 tree costs N sun point + the number of size Y trees you already own.
 Marchete: bitcount here we go
 Waffle3z: we might have like a 20-way tie at the top rn
 MrFruit: I am pretty sure you can just print "COMPLETE {INDEX}" 
 MrFruit: you don't need to move there
 TheBatMan_TM: Waffle3z yeah 28-9th
 Waffle3z: went from 14th to 6th
 MSmits: MrFruit that sounds really unrealistic though, I will do BFS for realism
 MrFruit:&#160;:)
 kuhnchris: I just advanced a League without doing anything LUL
 Beresta: in wood 1 it is more like 100-way tie :D 
 SinOfWrath: By sheer dumb luck I got to bronze 8th with my 3 line Wood2 code. Start of the contest is always the funniest.
 MrFruit: I am in wood 2
 MrFruit: yikes
 Marchete: man, a lot of rules
 MrFruit: I don't know if thats good
 ZarthaxX: lazy Marchete
 Zenoscave: Bronze rules paste anywhere?
 MSmits: boss is 178th
 Zenoscave: or is it in ref
 MSmits: in wood 1
 kuhnchris: Boss terrible at his own rules heh.
 Hoyer: Is it gonna get more complicated after bronze league
 Marchete: yes
 eulerscheZahl: have fun Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8584b55e-d8b2-487a-8d69-5307028fcea8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8584b55e-d8b2-487a-8d69-5307028fcea8</a>
 dbdr: Marchete, did you forget botg?
 AntiSquid: you've been here before hoyer, you should know
 MrFruit: The leaderboard keeps updating
 MrFruit: lol
 Marchete: no
 MSmits: bronze rules are the most complicated
 MrFruit: I can't even scroll down
 Hoyer: Yes but it's been so long
 Waffle3z: oh bronze is open
 Zenoscave: thanks euler
 MSmits: but players do make better bots later on
 Thiesjoo: Hmmm 
 Marchete: but it gets more complicated on silver+
 Beresta: I'm pretty sure that wood 1 boss just prints last possible move
 MSmits: Thiesjoo did you beat wood 1 yet?
 Marchete: MSmits prepare your bitboards
 Thiesjoo: MSmits already in bronze (:
 MSmits: haha good job
 MSmits: i am waiting for submit
 eulerscheZahl: thei was 2nd in wood1
 MSmits: Thiesjoo is also a very fast clasher
 AntiSquid: MSmits was already 1st, you missed it
 MrFruit: Wait does it increment to next level or decrement? Like Wood 1 - Wood 5 or Wood 5 - Wood 1
 eulerscheZahl: thiebt*
 MSmits: so i am not surprised
 Thiesjoo: But there are so many rules now
 eulerscheZahl: damnit
 Thiesjoo: Don't know what i should start with
 Hjax: MrFruit wood 2, wood 1, then bronze
 LordSkaven: I am only still in wood because I had to keep my family company for 30 minutes
 MrFruit: o
 MrFruit: thx
 Lachrymosa: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/T8FEFRj8">https://pastebin.com/T8FEFRj8</a> Bronze Rules if someone else didn't already throw them up
 MSmits: Thiesjoo you can go with a bunch of heuristic rules i guess, i'll probably try to write some search, not sure yet how
 Nerchio: wood1 and wood2 seem quite easy this time :D
 MrFruit: oh no seeds
 MSmits: will have to study the rules
 Tiramon: hope i'm promoted to bronze til i'm home&#160;;)
 Marchete: seems interesting
 AntiSquid: would have been simpler to just skip wood imo
 inoryy: is 100ms / turn a new thing or that's been the case before?
 AntiSquid: new
 LordSkaven: was 50 last fall challenge
 Thiesjoo: MSmits yeah my idea was scoring each tree, but to get that you need to simulate the entire game
 Marchete: maybe there is a short game
 Gabbek: damn, 2 spots behind the boss to advance&#160;:(
 Marchete: it's*
 AntiSquid: was more like 20 - 25 ms fall challenge :D
 MSmits: Thiesjoo right, then that may be what should be done
 inoryy: I guess leaderboard full of c++ it is
 Marchete: C# or C++?
 Thiesjoo: Don't think i can accomplish that in a slow language like JS/TS
 struct: game is around 130 turns
 MrFruit: Rank 2 Wood 2
 MrFruit: Dang
 MSmits: you can simulate the game, just not with as high a simcount
 MrFruit: So many ties
 schachmatt: Are bronze rules final?
 Beresta: everything below legend should be fine in any language I guess
 schachmatt: Or do they change again in silver
 Marchete: C# have some limitations with some bit operations
 KiwiTae: lets bet on when struct bot looses its first game
 MSmits: what do you mean Marchete
 Marchete: it tends to change byte to int
 orangesnowfox: schachmatt they're final, unless they get changed for whatever reason
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: bit ops act on integers
 Hjax: you cant complete your opponents trees right? 
 MSmits: so it needs to be cast to int
 MSmits: but maybe in compilation it removes the cast
 orangesnowfox: Hjax, it doesn't seem so
 schachmatt: Thanks fox :laughing:
 MSmits: so might not matter for speed Marchete
 MrFruit: i am about to be promoted in 10 sec
 Marchete: byte + byte = int
 TheCrucial: is there a "draw" here? it seems draws are considered as someone's win
 MrFruit: :o
 Marchete: wth
 MSmits: Marchete yes, the operator + acts on integers
 MSmits: so it casts them to integers
 orangesnowfox: TheCrucial: Draws have first place, and first place
 struct: TheCrucial yes there are draws
 Marchete: don't care, if I have byte +byte the result should be byte
 MSmits: either implicitly or you need to do it explicitly, dont remember
 Marchete: int + int&#160;!= int64
 MSmits: sure, but thats a design choice by the C# guys, must be a reason for it
 Waffle3z: what does dormant affect? you can only do one action a day anyway, right?
 Marchete: yes, actions
 TheCrucial: ah I see, thanks. I've just seen myself   "blured" when I have the same points. thought it is a loss
 MSmits: not one action a day
 MSmits: one action a turn
 MSmits: multiple turns a day
 MSmits: as many as you have sunpoints for
 emh: got my covid vaccine today. first round
 MSmits: grats
 Waffle3z: forgot how you separate actions in a single print
 emh: thx
 mUusitalo: Aw man, this challenge looks like you just need raw horsepower like the previous two
 Lachrymosa: emh be sure to work out the shoulder you got it in and HYDRATE
 mUusitalo: and by horsepower i mean an efficient search
 MSmits: Waffle3z you dont do that i think, unless its different in bronze
 AntiSquid: emh i have the antibodies, no vax, should i get it&#160;?
 MSmits: a turn has 1 action
 Marchete: it's simultaneous, no?
 MSmits: but a day is not a turn
 Firlain: is the graphic window down for the challenge&#160;? (hi)
 emh: Lachrymosa I did and I don't have any trouble hehe
 MSmits: day has multiple turns = multiple actions
 emh: except for the work out
 emh: AntiSquid nahh I don't know I think antibodies are better no?
 Nerchio: Players that are asleep do not receive input. Does this mean you lose information what your opponent is doing?
 Marchete: yes, "both players perform one action simultaneously."
 Lachrymosa: emh give it a day or two, I was lucky not to get anything but minor fatigue and some soreness on par with a gym day. But it's wrecked a few of my friends
 struct: yes Nerchio
 Marchete: damn
 MSmits: Nerchio probably yeah, but since you know the full gamestate, it should not matter
 emh: ohh wow
 Nerchio: thats interesting
 mUusitalo: Oh, that might be interesting
 MSmits: unless you generally look at players actions to determine their playstyle during the game
 Nerchio: MSmits true but you can wake up to a different reality by sleeping multiple turns in a row haha
 MSmits: then not knowing might be a problem
 MSmits: yes you can
 MSmits: but the gamestate is all that matters
 emh: Bronze. welcome
 MSmits: history doesnt matter
 MSmits: unless you want to use it to guess the opponent playstyle
 Nerchio: true
 struct: My bot completely ignores opponent, for now
 Marchete: this game has a lot of possible actions
 AntiSquid: time to view struct as the bronze boss and do something about it @_@
 MSmits: Marchete yeah, but you can do only 1 per turn
 Marchete: I mean for encoding
 Marchete: like NN?
 MSmits: that makes it a lot easier than the gitc style games 
 Marchete: this would be hell
 MSmits: oh, right
 MSmits: well you can do a value estimation
 MSmits: just evaluate the gamestate
 MSmits: output 1 number
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: not 1 for each action
 Marchete: but your inputs?
 MSmits: the gamestate
 MSmits: so lots of input
 MSmits: 37 cells, 37 treesizes etc.
 Beresta: I wonder if anyone ever did a working NN for these competitions..?
 Marchete: 37 cells *4 levels*2players*sunposition
 Marchete: yes, they do
 MSmits: Beresta at least for an unofficial contest someone did
 MSmits: br2k
 Beresta: its quite touch limit on source code size to encode any decently sized NN
 Beresta: tough*
 MSmits: most people do just fine for the boardgames we have on here
 MSmits: and also csb/br2k
 MSmits: but yeah, it's a consideration
 Beresta: any articles to read on that&gt;?
 Marchete: don't even think about that on a contest
 MSmits: I'll let someone else answer that. I sort of learned it from chat in tidbits
 MSmits: yeah dont bother with it now really
 dreadylein: there is an writeup from pb4 and agade i think about how they approached it for csb iirc
 MSmits: the only people who have a chance of pulling that off are the ones that did it before and even they take a big risk trying it
 Beresta: I have no goals in winning or anything, just having some fun in gold :P 
 MSmits: just do a heuristic bot and once you are done, try a search bot
 emh: what are those creatures btw? Pokemons? Studio Ghiblis?
 MSmits: anyways, going back to coding, or i will be chatting till midnight and get nothing done&#160;:)
 Marchete: so?
 MSmits: :P
 Icebox: Hey hey
 struct: hi Icebox
 AntiSquid: you're alive!
 MahirSez: Has bronze league started?
 Icebox: Yes! Alive so far
 Hjax: yes bronze is open
 Lachrymosa: It is open yes
 Hjax: never under estimate contests ability to resurrect the dead 
 ZarthaxX: Icebox hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
 itzluku: lolol
 itzluku: everyone is just deleteing trees in teh arena :D
 Hjax: im at work so i can only watch on longingly for like 8 hours&#160;:(
 Hjax: should have pulled a euler
 NinjaDoggy: hi everyone :D
 Beresta: hello bronze
 itzluku: anyone streaming&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: hey NinjaDoggy&#160;:*
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 when stream? i'm still waiting
 Automaton2000: i don't think it was more like a popularity vote, who can mobilize the most players
 struct: please have mercy on my bot, dont test too much against it 
 MadKnight: no way
 Lachrymosa: Ahoy MadKnight
 Hjax: i refuse struct
 AntiSquid: you're the bronze boss struct .
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we have to hack CG to steal struct's bot to test against it locally on my GPU which can run 2816 threads in parallel
 Automaton2000: no, but would there be a problem daninja?
 struct: no chance 
 struct: for it to be bronze boss
 DaNinja: eh?
 Hjax: lol the bot summoned someone
 itzluku: so the structure is, opimize your bot to beat the next "boss" and so on
 itzluku: not making one perfect bot top down
 MadKnight: AutomatonNN u did it again
 itzluku:&#160;?
 DaNinja: someone ban Automation2000!
 Dr-D: Optimize it to beat all players, one of them will get a new boss&#160;;)
 Scarfield: get a higher score than the boss, so win against both players and boss
 MadKnight: DaNinja imagine how euler felt when AutomatonNN was summoning his in like every 3rd of his message
 itzluku: i am 8th with 84% batlles
 MadKnight: s
 MadKnight: him*
 itzluku: is that an overall ranking?
 itzluku: or subdiv
 itzluku: my bot cant be that good xd
 KiwiTae: itzluku your in wood2
 Hjax: its my division 
 KiwiTae: best bots are in bronze
 Hjax: by*
 AntiSquid: Guillaume44 wrong hex game play the contest, stop submitting there @_@
 leona: hi all, the gameplay is not loading for me in the spring challenge (neither in the editor, nor in the leaderboard), did anyone have the same problem?&#160;:(
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i didn't make up the number 2816
 Automaton2000: then you have to do to get the link to the puzzle
 itzluku: i only advance if i beat all i nmy div?
 KiwiTae: if u beat the boss
 Zenoscave: higher than boss in score == advanced
 Hjax: itzluku you have end up higher ranked than the boss
 Smelty: CONTEST
 Zenoscave: but your battles in progress must be 100%
 itzluku: 96% :O
 Hjax: i love the early dominance of python3 on the leaderboard
 Hjax: easiest way to get bronze for the full spec
 MadKnight: Automaton2000, 2816 is actually like 256*11
 Automaton2000: i still haven't figured out how to code in it
 itzluku: i havent found a good way of debuging xd
 Wontonimo: just logged on and checked out the contest
 itzluku: u can do one print("WAIT"+adddebugstringhere) and thats it
 Wontonimo: random bot places about 1/2 way in wood 2.
 Notaboredguy: I love this website
 MadKnight: me too
 MadKnight: but what's your point
 Wontonimo: just published bot 2 which harvests tree in best soil which beats the wood 2 boss.  Not much more to it than that.
 Wontonimo: gotta wait for promotion to see what wood 1 has
 emh: I'm eating thin round potato cakes with caviar and also trying out with mango papaya salsa
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's try to recreate a boss' logic
 Automaton2000: i can write it as a puzzle
 Lachrymosa: may I recommend thing corn-based triangles for the salsa instead?
 Lachrymosa: thin*
 emh: ahh yes might be better
 KiwiTae: I am still at work getting distracted by general chat
 shabugcx: 嗨你们怎么升级的？
 KiwiTae: shabugcx #cn
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine not testing 2816 games in parallel 
 shabugcx: 怎么了
 Automaton2000: so i get the sense that you don't have to pay for that
 MadKnight: shabugcx #cn pls
 emh: MadKnight do you have a 3090?
 MadKnight: emh nono those ones got much more than that
 shabugcx: MadKnight  你可以指出问题
 emh: ohh ok
 emh: thought so
 MadKnight: mine is from 2013 emh
 emh: I've got the 2080 Ti
 Hildan: can my own shadows affect my own trees?
 shabugcx: 哇我
 MadKnight: then u surely got more threads than that
 MadKnight: emh just start using it
 emh: hehe
 emh: I used it for t-sne mapping of opengameart
 shabugcx: 那款游戏比较好玩又烧大脑
 emh: was like 500k images
 MadKnight: shabugcx #cn or /kick
 AntiSquid: 你好。 单击#cn并在其中输入中文。 谢谢你。 shabugcx
 AntiSquid: #cn
 KiwiTae: shabugcx 游戏Boss, 去 #cn 聊天，這裡只有英文
 MadKnight: choose your fighter
 AntiSquid: are you actually mod Madao&#160;?
 MadKnight: it's actually a fun story
 MadKnight: well u see
 MadKnight: *madao left the chat*
 shabugcx: :joy:
 shabugcx: I don't understand when this level is done。How to proceed to the next level
 MadKnight: submit your code
 MadKnight: and get ranking above the bossd
 MadKnight: ezpz
 Hjax: shabugcx you need to be higher than the boss, and at 100% games in progress
 MSmits: this video is really good
 MSmits: Tutorial video by Gaurav Sen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/gZMdOiqchDk">https://youtu.be/gZMdOiqchDk</a>
 bjy: any way to speed up progress (besides apparently beating up the same opponents over and over)...?
 jacek: oO
 struct: maybe it wasnt a wise idea to submit this bot 
 MadKnight: unsubmit it 
 Hjax: why struct? scared of it losing?
 MSmits: he's a tester
 MadKnight: scared of everyone using it to improve their bots hh
 MadKnight: Hjax
 Hjax: this game looks bitboardable, although ive never done a hex bitboard
 shabugcx: Hjax  I did reach my goal but I just couldn't find the next page
 AntiSquid: doesn't take much for top 10 or even 1st atm, so won't change anything
 struct: hjax Iknow I will lose, my bot is not good
 struct: Hjax It is
 jacek: hijacks
 King_Coda: YEAH
 King_Coda: AND SO IT BEGINS

 King_Coda: Damn struct, you're number one on the contest???
 King_Coda: Congrats!
 bjy: hrm, my bot's winning streak has turned into a lots-of-ties streak at only 47%...  welp, to lunch!
 struct: I tested the contest
 eulerscheZahl: he's a strong contestant
 why_anonymous: 504 always
 eulerscheZahl: psst struct
 struct: ups
 struct: yeah, im just that good
 DumbassDan: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: he's number 1 out of 1000 (or how many there currently are)
 struct: with 100% winrate
 King_Coda: 11,000 roughy

 AntiSquid: cegprakash 🇮🇳
 Astrobytes: amazing, 60th in bronze with a couple of lines of code before I went to vote and go to the shops
 Astrobytes: I like those kind of wood leagues
 AntiSquid:  /?disableChatif you need quiet
 struct: do you guys like the game?
 XeroOl: Good morning
 XeroOl: I'm not sure what to think of the game yet
 Astrobytes: No idea, I just sorted moves
 AntiSquid: idk yet struct . depends on the indexing
 eulerscheZahl: you have an election going on Astrobytes?
 Snoepie: Any advice for newbies?
 Tiramon: havn't fully read bronze rules struct so hard to say ... just lifted my day limit&#160;;)
 Scarfield: i just output random move, timeout quite often and still got bronze xD
 XeroOl: I'm regretting my choice for lua
 Astrobytes: Yes euler, local elections
 King_Coda: I have no idea how to code
 why_anonymous: me too
 King_Coda: but im doing the challenge anywya
 King_Coda: s
 synchoz: King_Coda i belive in you
 XeroOl: I'm getting "network status 504" or something
 synchoz: me 2
 King_Coda: lol thanks synchoz
 XeroOl: huh, not anymore
 struct: I thought on porting this game before tbh
 struct: I even talked with acat about it
 jacek: i wonder what would happen if you ported it 1 month ago
 AntiSquid: would have been fun
 King_Coda: I'm in Wood 2 league apparently
 XeroOl: I'm still in wood 2 because I just woke up lol
 Wontonimo: haha ... that would have been funny if you did that struct&#160;!
 King_Coda: I will definitely do better in the fall challenge
 Zenoscave: owned means currently on board?
 King_Coda: by then i would have actually learned code
 KalamariKing: King_Coda lol same
 King_Coda: i'm still taking my classes now
 KalamariKing: using a language I haven't touched in months...
 King_Coda: KalamariKing!
 synchoz: i got to wood 2 doing nothing but harvesting and now i have no idea what to do XD
 XeroOl: I'm using lua right now
 KalamariKing: King_Coda hello&#160;;)
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/cLdouPK.png">https://i.imgur.com/cLdouPK.png</a>
 KalamariKing: XeroOl you're actually doing it aren't you
 KalamariKing: you madman
 Tiramon: ok so the shadows are the part that increase the complexity ... i see
 King_Coda: I'm in 269th place
 King_Coda: nice
 King_Coda: AH NO
 XeroOl: globally?
 XeroOl: that's impressive
 KalamariKing: is the game supposed to be a large grey square
 King_Coda: "Network status 504"
 KalamariKing: because that's all I got, ide and replay
 KalamariKing: I've been spammed with those King_Coda just keep working ig?
 eulerscheZahl: the cat followed my advice :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6666b34849b94f9c3c3427c9f7103e0c7acf">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6666b34849b94f9c3c3427c9f7103e0c7acf</a>
 KalamariKing: What do you see in the ide game window
 DomiKo: yap yap
 eulerscheZahl: final rules there
 Tiramon: CG fix those network errors and scale up the servers ...
 Astrobytes: :D
 Zenoscave: fix it ezpz
 jacek: wait for deploy friday
 KalamariKing: Someone, please, I need an answerIs the game window supposed to be solid grey
 struct: I took others chance to get 1st&#160;:/
 dreadylein: if (doesntwokr) Work() 
 struct: at least in the first hour or so
 jacek: KalamariKing thats fog of war
 Astrobytes: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry struct, i'll get there
 Zenoscave: Me too&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: jacek so it IS supposed to be grey
 struct: I also have referee for brutaltester
 Zenoscave: My current bot waiting for submit is pretty "decent"
 XeroOl: lets goo I want to be not in wood league
 struct: Should I publish it?
 Zenoscave: So do I struct
 ZarthaxX: undefeated struct nice
 Zenoscave: does this default not work?
 struct: I have no idea
 struct: Maybe I wont publish mine, since it has the bitboards
 struct: I had no access to referee so I made my own
 Zenoscave: the answer is no.
 King_Coda: Ugh, why does doing the battles take so longgggg
 Zenoscave: It doesn't work with default. I'll modify default to work and fork. keep your bitboards for now, struct
 Tiburso: i'm getting synchronization issues 
 Tiburso: i dont know why
 Tiburso: im coding in c++ 
 XeroOl: only 4 people on the lua leaderboards
 XeroOl:&#160;:)
 XeroOl: that means I have a chance
 Tiburso: did someone have this problem?
 King_Coda: I'm only 64% done
 XeroOl: what do you mean by synchronization issues
 struct: My bot feels like a NN atm
 struct: :p
 Tiburso: its giving me a warning 
 casmith789: me too tiburso
 RockyMullet: get me out of wood 2 already lol
 casmith789: I'm wondering if it is because we don't have all the rules yet
 Tiburso: and my outputs are not the same as the inputs
 Astrobytes: oh hey RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: it's like a if and every game is a draw haha
 XeroOl: oh yeah you need to read all the inputs
 RockyMullet: Hello Astrobytes :wave:
 Tiburso: but i am reading all the inpurs
 jacek: purrrrr
 struct: you need to read all the inputs and only output one time per turn
 XeroOl: I'm scared as to what the hex grid will mean
 Tiburso:&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: hey Rocky! The draw count is high here
 Tiburso: oh ok 
 RockyMullet: Hello pew pew master&#160;!
 struct: What are draws?
 ZarthaxX: CARNEEEEEE
 SabertheLost: poor boss
 Zenoscave: pewpew
 XeroOl: draw is when both players get 1st
 RockyMullet: CARNEEE&#160;!!
 ZarthaxX: HOWDYY
 RockyMullet: holaaa
 XeroOl: @struct draw is when there isn't a winner and both palyers have the same score
 Hjax: ok the mullet has arrived 
 Hjax: we can start the contest now 
 KalamariKing: thats what 'draw' means zero
 KalamariKing: xero*
 Hjax: (hey RockyMullet :P )
 Istian: Is there anything else worth doing in wood 2 other than completing the first tree on the array if it's mine?
 struct: I know sorry, it was a joke since my bot hasnt lost or drew yet
 RockyMullet: been a while since I loged in :sweat_smile:
 RockyMullet: hey Hjax :wave:
 XeroOl: how do you not have a draw in wood 2 lol
 XeroOl: it's miserable down here
 struct: Who will be the first to defeat me?
 NinjaDoggy: lol struct
 emh: I lavv meowy bannih. she is my friend. meowy bannih
 XeroOl: struct wait for me I'm getting there
 Zenoscave: Short of simming the game I think I have most the mechanics down. Sim time.
 RockyMullet: right I need to write something about mullets in my output
 RockyMullet: what am I doing
 bjy: kind of offputting...  waiting to advance, unclear future rules so no point in tinkering...?
 struct: ok it finally finished :D
 RockyMullet: yeah, there's not much dept in wood 2 hehe
 SabertheLost: I neeed promotion!!!
 XeroOl: @bjy I'm in the same position
 bjy: unless stepping through ref code...  nah :P
 XeroOl: Although I'm going to assume that the number of days will go above 1
 llllllllll: @bjy the competition started like what, 2 hours ago?
 AntiSquid: where is struct gone&#160;?
 llllllllll: we have 11 more days to tinker, no reason to rush
 AntiSquid: nvm looking at wrong game
 jacek: yinsh?
 SabertheLost: It does not punish me for trying to complete&#160;:) 
 bjy: no rush, just the time I carved out for this is gonna be limited...
 XeroOl: yeah, I only have so much time today, so it's not fun to spend half of it waiting
 Zenoscave: llllllllll you a StarCraft fan?
 emh: roach rush, toss cannon rush, ling rush, marine rush
 llllllllll: @Zenoscave nah, why?
 KalamariKing: Is this challenge fog of war
 Zenoscave: your name
 RockyMullet: KalamariKing doesnt appear to be so far
 King_Coda: 96% done!
 Hjax: i think ive asked him that before too @Zenoscave
 bjy: 78%...
 KalamariKing: rocky
 XeroOl: no fair, I'm only at 64
 KalamariKing: lmao wrong key
 Zenoscave: lol Nice thinking Hjax
 RockyMullet: hum I doubt I'll reach bronze during my lunch break :disappointed:
 KalamariKing: RockyMullet my game screen is literally just solid grey
 karliso: No randomness and no fog of war?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow bronze is pretty locked up
 Hjax: correct karliso
 KalamariKing: I get the feeling I should see something
 KiwiTae: KalamariKing you dont need visual anyway
 XeroOl: yeah that's not good
 XeroOl: the visuals are very useful though
 RockyMullet: KalamariKing hum maybe your browser is not happy
 KalamariKing: KiwiTae right but I wanna, they're pretty useful for someone visual like m
 KalamariKing: me*
 validity-check: hello
 KiwiTae: KalamariKing make your own representation in js or smth
 Smelty: hmm
 King_Coda: im 266 outta 280&#160;:(
 daffie: what are the yellow arrows that move around the board
 ChrisJM: Wood 2, I've got the bot just picking the last action each turn and it's collecting the trees.  Is there any more depth than that?  Not progressing up the leaderboard very fast.
 bjy: 1 out of whatever...
 bjy: I'm sure this won't last...
 bjy: but still...  let me advance to the point where I get stomped plz :P
 MrFruit: zeeee
 MrFruit: All games have been ties for me
 MrFruit: After 121
 King_Coda: eh, i'll do better when fall rolls around and i actually know how to code
 Hjax: daffie thats the direction the sun is coming from 
 Hjax: theres shadows in bronze that affect sunlight income
 daffie: alrighty
 _overflow_: =]
 emh: in the land of mordor where the shadows lie
 itzluku: whats the way to make error/print debug outputs in python
 KalamariKing: print( *msg, file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 itzluku: within the spring challenge
 RockyMullet: pleaze CG sir, can I come in wood 1&#160;?
 itzluku: not breaking the game
 MrFruit: The thing he posted
 MrFruit: works I think
 emh: if u want red output, put blush=True
 bjy: yup
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm starting to believe that this challenge is gonna be dominated by NN strategies
 AntiSquid: hello RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: hey AntiSquid&#160;!!
 RockyMullet: I came out of my cave
 Soutto: what is nn strategies&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i thought the C in CG stands for cave
 KalamariKing: nn means neural network
 adamek123123123: can someone help me
 Soutto: oh, thanks
 Westicles: not necessarily
 struct: can confirm, my bot is a NN
 toolmonster: wassup
 Tiramon: wow there is a lot of shadow when the board fills up&#160;;)
 itzluku: lul ok thanks
 ChrisJM: Can the bots persistently store data for NN?
 ChrisJM: between games
 bjy: any hints on future board sizes/scale? :P
 Tiramon: you have to train offline
 KalamariKing: struct if you don't mind me asking how did you train it? or is it reinforcement learning?
 RockyMullet: ChrisJM no but you can do it offline and then hardcode the result in your submit
 MrFruit: How do you import the training??
 KalamariKing: oh lol tira​mon answered nvm
 struct: KalamariKing its not a NN, i was joking
 KalamariKing: oh lol
 KiwiTae: KalamariKing or was he
 MrFruit: so just a lot conditionals will do the trick?
 Tiramon: 146:110 against struct ... thats not that far apart as i feared&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: now we're getting places
 emh: we are the knights who say NN
 struct: o.o
 RockyMullet: finally promoted&#160;!
 XeroOl: I don't yet see how this is a neural network problem
 Marchete: I sense a powerful mullet around here...
 bjy: 89%....
 XeroOl: but that's probably because I'm stuck in wood 2
 RockyMullet: hey Marchete&#160;!!
 MrFruit: so many ducking ties
 Marchete: o/
 MrFruit: I cannot pass 90
 struct: you are 146:110 against me Tiramon?
 MadKnight: he's not powerful he's sturdy, Marchete
 Tiramon: oh damn i havn't implement richness 0 yet
 Admirallll: guys its so bad i should wait 1 hour for wood 2 promotion
 Queuebee: struct may I ask what the 4 numbers are you are outputting in debug? :o
 Marchete: silky yet powerful
 Tiramon: you won but i'm not that far behind you in score&#160;;)
 Westicles: Is 37 too small?  Seems like a big tie coming
 MrFruit: What rank are you guys at?
 MadKnight: imagine thinking the mullet is rockyt
 RockyMullet: shinning in the sun of the contest
 Marchete: it's always the same start?
 bjy: 1...  wood 1 I think?
 struct: Queuebee is just the ammount of tree heights
 Queuebee: oohh
 ZarthaxX: Marchete this? Players start the game with two size 1 trees placed randomly along the edge of the grid.
 struct: game is always symetrical
 TobiasA: so this is what contests do to you huh
 Zenoscave: gz TobiasA
 Tiramon: damn i hate those players with a boss like picture ...
 TobiasA: the devs were kind enough to make th bot dumber than me
 KalamariKing: lol
 XeroOl: lmao boss-like picture is kind of cruel
 Nerchio: so the shadow doesn't  change if you grow or sell trees except if day ends?
 XeroOl: since I'm using lua, I can use my free time to write an actually useful standard library
 ZarthaxX: yup Nerchio
 struct: yes Nerchio
 Tiramon: right nerchio
 Nerchio: is it written somewhere and i missed it
 TobiasA: that was weird
 Tiramon: 11 games 11 won .. .good start of submit
 Zenoscave: I should read the rules now... I'm beginning to think I've trapped my bot
 emh: do you think I will go to Silver without planting a Seed? I'm 174/460
 oddrationale: If players have the same score and same # of tress, is it a tie?
 struct: no emh
 Queuebee: are you given the sun direction in bronze? Or is there a way to calculate it?
 bjy: yes, so many ties...
 XeroOl: oddrationale yes
 struct: My bot will be the bronze boss
 XeroOl: promotion to wood 1&#160;!!
 emh: hehe
 oddrationale: Thanks!
 bjy: 96%...
 DumbassDan: It's fun when simple tricks give a really nice boost, but it can be hard to understand why sometimes&#160;:)
 MrFruit: Has anyone gotten to silver?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: welcome to the acorn battle
 Zenoscave: are bosses predetirmined struct?
 struct: MrFruit silver is not open yet
 struct: Zenoscave Dont think so, I didnt made any boss
 Hjax: silver opens on monday i believe 
 Hjax: gold on wednesday, legend on friday 
 MrFruit: I see thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct thanks for not using M_PI
 MACKEYTH: Leagues Silver and above open on the 10th
 MrFruit: o
 Tiramon: 14/14 won ... still looks good ... but damn slow ...
 MrFruit: isn't that too long
 XeroOl: oh no wood 1 makes this complicated already
 MACKEYTH: Ignore that, Hjax is right
 casmith789: how do you take more than one action per turn? output more than one line?
 casmith789: or one line
 Queuebee: you can't
 Tiramon: no just don't use wait
 Marchete: struct the game is perfectly symmetric?
 struct: yes
 bjy: finally...  also bit lvl 8 heh...  but only ~15mins left until much later
 casmith789: oh, you just do one action then don't wait?
 Marchete: I mean, sun related?
 VaseSimion: You can write more commands in the same line, using space between them
 struct: Doesnt matter Marchete
 RockyMullet: ok all wins and 1 tie, might be able to get bronze beofre my lunch break :D
 Marchete: how it doesn't matter?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess bronze is final rules?
 struct: ah wait
 struct: maybe it does
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Marchete: time related growth
 inoryy: that settles it, literally unplayable
 struct: yeah it matters
 Marchete: ofc
 Mourfette: the fact that the first code is so simple everybody has it makes it very slow to get to wood 1... Every match is 1st place for both players :D
 XeroOl: if you can do multiple things in one turn, that's really good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need to fertilize the forest, does a squirel poop in the woods?
 Marchete: it's played with alternate positions?
 emh: struct: listen to Star 69 by Fatboy Slim: "They know what is what. But they don't know what is what. The just struct, wtf?"
 MACKEYTH: New rules for Silver: There are now 5 forests and 3 suns. Trees can be equipped with pruning hooks
 RockyMullet: inoryy whats unplayable&#160;? (also hi)
 Hjax: new rules in silver, trees move randomly 
 inoryy: RockyMullet the game because of the sun on first turn (also hi&#160;:) )
 Tiramon: 18/18 and rank 14 ... i'm coming for you struct ... :smiling_imp:
 Marchete: I think board is symmetric but not the whole game
 RockyMullet: yeah seems like a player as a big advantage
 struct: you are right Marchete
 RockyMullet: but I didnt see bronze rules yet
 Marchete: a player can* have advantage
 AntiSquid: don't think so
 AntiSquid: chat scroll
 inoryy: RockyMullet (I'm joking)
 Marchete: paste here AntiSquid
 Marchete: I can't see it
 RockyMullet: oh ok, I didnt see the bronze rules yet hehe, I assumed those little yellow lines were the sun or something
 AntiSquid: was responding to a different message Marchete @_@
 Marchete: ahh :D
 inoryy: RockyMullet they are
 RockyMullet: kk
 Marchete: sun-&gt;P1---P2
 inoryy: I mean, there's definitely some advantage to p1, I'm just joking about it being unplayable
 RockyMullet: I'm stuck at 27% in wood 1 :slight_frown:
 Marchete: probably by the time P2 have &lt;-sun
 Hjax: they are, your trees cast shadows, you dont get sun income from trees in shadows that come from trees at least as large as they are 
 RockyMullet: will take a while
 bjy: bronze is eenteresting
 Marchete: he has higher trees to shadow more
 Hjax: so a size 3 tree, casts a length 3 shadow, and no one gets income from trees in that shadow
 Marchete: i think it depends, but maybe it's P2
 RockyMullet: oh interesting
 bjy: bah, not gonna do anything in the 10 mins I have left though...  gl hf all
 Marchete: well, let's see on legend
 Nerchio: so can you complete a tree and plant on the same hex before round ends?
 MACKEYTH: If both players try to plant a seed on the same cell, how is it resolved?
 Nerchio: anybody knows
 struct: yes Nerchio
 Marchete: top players will complain if they see the slight unfair advantage
 Nerchio: how do you know everything struct :D
 struct: i was a tester
 RoboStac: MACKEYTH - plant gets cancelled, sun is refunded but source trees  go dormant
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tossing a seed farther can have an advantage
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh
 Nerchio: kinda weird that shadow doesnt change like it doesnt disappear when u 'sell' a tree
 Tiramon: so you can complete a dorment tree?
 Nerchio: but you can plant on the same hex
 struct: no Tiramon
 struct: You can complete a tree and seed that cell
 RoboStac: shadows only matter on day transition Nerchio
 Tiramon: oh k sure
 Marchete: I'm not sure about how bitboarding
 struct: I dont think I can give tips on the bitboard 
 Marchete: why
 Nerchio: RoboStac yeah already was told but feels weird
 AntiSquid: you have a bitboard for this struct?
 Marchete: I thought about layered ones
 Marchete: Nxlayers of 37 bits
 TobiasA: what does the "send parameter to ide" button do?
 Rag: whenever I output something different than wait I get an error saying I am not reading all the input
 Marchete: but it goes high pretty fast
 Hjax: TobiasA it copies the seed and players, it lets you replicate the same game in the ide viewer for testing
 struct: yes AntiSquid
 ddreams: rag, don't break before all the input is read
 TobiasA: like on the main codingame site window?
 Hjax: it will open up the ide with the same parameters yes
 struct: nice Tiramon
 RockyMullet: let me iiiiiiiiin
 Developer.py: Hello, this is my first spring challenge, I do not understand why only one of my tree gets 'COMPLETE' even though its in the game loop.
 TobiasA: is that what you guys do?
 TobiasA: should i be doing that?
 davilla: oh ok there are TEN live events right now that should be doable
 dbdr: struct, how does a cell become unusable?
 sirsatan: wood 2 can be called ONE BIG DRAW
 jrke: oh struct congrats you ae first
 dbdr: oh, it's part of the map
 dbdr: never mind&#160;:)
 jrke: are*
 RockyMullet: sirsatan wood 1 kind of feel like that too
 struct: dbdr do you mean dormant?
 Thienu: waiting for wood 2 battles to finish be like
 Quidome: So, the nutrient value is only decreased by one when completing a tree?
 Tiramon: 38/39 rank 4 .. still looks good
 struct: dbdr unusable are given at the start, they dont change
 Marchete: richness==0 is unusable for everything?
 Marchete: man, too many values everywhere
 dbdr: no, richness 0. right. thanks!
 struct: yes marchete
 MACKEYTH: sirsatan - Eh, nothing for it. Since players can affect each other in wood 2 and 1 they're both deterministic
 MACKEYTH: *can't
 Marchete: the game is cute. I hate hex and bitboards, but it's cute
 TobiasA: oh i have figured it out thnx Hjax
 Developer.py: Can someone explain to me why only one of my tree gets completed even though the code is inside the game loop?
 struct: you can only complete a tree per turn
 MACKEYTH: @Developer.py: start debugging, man.
 MACKEYTH: Is your COMPLETE command being output?
 MACKEYTH: Are you getting a message from the game about it?
 MACKEYTH: Do you have enough sun?
 Marchete: step 1 - having a complete game simulator, estimated time- 4 weeks :D
 TobiasA: wait how do i "unsend parameters"?
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Whiskee: also have you removed the tree from the grid lol
 XeroOl: how is this game so complicated lol
 Whiskee: or are you trying to complete the same one
 Developer.py: oh okay, @struct
 Developer.py: I am checking if the tree's index is grater than 6
 Lachrymosa: I have unleashed my bronze bot &gt;:3
 shashwat986: When does the promotion happen? I'm ranked 69 (nice) in Wood 2, but I haven't lost a single game. Boss is rank 87
 Hjax: you have to be at 100%
 casmith789: when you get to 100% of your games
 struct: your submit needs to reach 100%
 Zenoscave: once all games are played for submit
 shashwat986: ah, thanks
 shashwat986: Any way I can get a headstart on wood 1's rules?
 struct: chat is so laggy for mods&#160;:/
 Marchete: bronze rules are in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6666b34849b94f9c3c3427c9f7103e0c7acf">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6666b34849b94f9c3c3427c9f7103e0c7acf</a>
 Lachrymosa: I'm only at 13% bronze submission but haven't seen a loss yet
 Marchete: it's a clone with bronze ruleset
 Lachrymosa: thats promising :3
 Marchete: or wood1
 Marchete: can't recall :D
 Tiramon: i currently lost 5 of 53
 Tiramon: sadly i still loose against struct&#160;;)
 Lachrymosa: I haven't seen myself vs struct yet
 Lachrymosa: fingers cross :D
 VaseSimion: iAre your battles slow also?
 Tiramon: oooh ... yeees... 
 Lachrymosa: crawling along at about 1% per 2 minutes 17% now
 actualCoderTrevor: Woohoo Wood 1 Babieeeee!
 Denshire: yeah im not used to contests so is it normal for them to be so slow or
 Tiramon: server has a lot of load right now
 Tiramon: will get better the next days ... atleast normally it does
 Denshire: yeah that makes sense
 Zenoscave: apppackerino who are you
 Tiramon: but still CG could scale up the servers a bit ...
 llllllllll: thats a lot of $$$$$
 Secret_sister2:&#160;;-;
 MACKEYTH: Back in my day we didn't have your fancy server cycles.
 Secret_sister2: lol
 MACKEYTH: We got our punchcard allowance and we liked it
 Secret_sister2: lol
 Tiramon: ok punchcard is before my time&#160;;)
 MACKEYTH: Mine too, TBH.
 orangesnowfox: yeah, I'm like 19 lol
 MACKEYTH: My dad has stories, though.
 Secret_sister2: lol
 Zenoscave: Secret_sister2 can you say anything of substance?
 Secret_sister2: no?
 ZarthaxX: struct someone beated you!
 Zenoscave: then be quiet
 Secret_sister2: what
 Zenoscave: westicles another smurf? How many do you have?
 AntiSquid: next one ban @_@
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 VaseSimion: Are usualy streaming solving this? I cheecked the streaming button and it doesn't look too good
 struct: ZarthaxX&#160;:(
 Tiramon: you are so impatient AntiSquid&#160;;)
 jrke: is there only one condition for changing the day?
 Astrobytes: That's a known trollish account Tiramon
 AntiSquid: seen enough to make more accurate predictions Tiramon
 Tiramon: oh ok
 synchoz: is the starter kit like a must or i can do fine with out&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: The day advances once both players have WAITed
 Tiramon: you can do fine wihtout synchoz it's just there to help
 ddreams: no need to use a starter kit
 synchoz: oh ok thank you
 MACKEYTH: I didn't use it, but it might be helpful.
 Tiramon: so you don't miss any of the input etc
 AntiSquid: think i used starter once, it was more of a hindrance
 Wontonimo: okay,  i think Wood 1 is completed for me.  my algo can be summarized greedily maximize "value_to_harvest - full_cost_to_grow_tree" with zero ply
 ZarthaxX: struct you can fix it for sure&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: welp at least I beat bronze bot :3 Illedan beat me, but I'm somehow sorta sitting above him for now... we'll see when it stabilizes
 rmuskovets: starter kit? the code already in the editor or smth else?
 Hjax: theres a link to some starter kits in the spec
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/tree/main/starterAIs">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/tree/main/starterAIs</a>
 Hjax: they do a bit more input parsing than the default code
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/tree/main/starterAIs">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/tree/main/starterAIs</a>
 Developer.py: Why does my code only complete a tree once even though its in the while loop?
 rmuskovets: ty
 Tiramon: ok ... guess it's not enough for struct yet, but atleast it looks like top 4 to top 2
 TobiasA: what is input parsing?
 Hjax: TobiasA turning the strings that the game gives you into something useful 
 TobiasA: oh thanks an why do i see two of myself in the place to select agent?
 Hjax: because you are fighting yourself 
 Hjax: you can run yourcode against itself 
 Denshire: pretty sure you can pit your current code against the last code you submitted or smth
 TobiasA: oh
 TobiasA: makes sesnse
 TobiasA: haha sense
 Tiramon: last arena code and current ide code are available
 Secret_sister2: I need help with this loop puzzle, But I don't really know.
 AntiSquid: you need help with more than that
 jrke: does the seed we plant also becomes dormant for that day?
 Hjax: yes jrke
 Hjax: Performing this action impacts both the source tree and the planted seed. Meaning both trees will be dormant until the next day. 
 Tiramon: Performing this action impacts both the source tree and the planted seed. Meaning both trees will be dormant until the next day.
 Tiramon: quote end ...
 lifetimeLearner007: what if seed is influenced by more than 1 tree?
 Non0: Any way to make the battles go faster&#160;? Thanks
 Hjax: Non0 wait a few hours for the servers to calm down
 Hjax: its going to be slow for a while 
 jrke: richness level also looks constant isn't it/
 jrke:&#160;?
 Tiramon: in the ranking no
 Tiramon: in the replay .. there is agear below the player where you can increase the speed
 lifetimeLearner007: richness is constant. I read that somewhere
 Tiramon: ok next step ... find out how many days in a cycle a tree is in the spooky shadow
 AntiSquid: the indexing of the hex cells is indeed irritating @_@ struct
 davilla: not even defined anywhere
 davilla: have to figure it out by playing
 Wontonimo: well, AntiSquid they didn't have FOW so they had to add something irritating
 Wontonimo: davilla - it is shown in the debug screen
 tinyhhj: how to go up wood 1 league
 Wontonimo: tinyhhj - my algo can be summarized as value_to_harvest - full_cost_to_grow_tree
 davilla: oh thanks! forgot about that
 Tiramon: be ranked higher than the boss
 tinyhhj: i already submit my first version
 SabertheLost: Why do the game start on day zero? 
 AntiSquid: 0 index most common for languages
 Wontonimo: SabertheLost because we are programmers, and we index with 0
 SabertheLost: Yes, but not for most dates
 AntiSquid: i am happy with 0 index @_@
 davilla: submit your complaint to the arbitration committee
 Zenoscave: arbitrarily
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: SabertheLost just ping struct then
 Uljahn: zeroday bug
 AntiSquid: new algo name: 0 day exploit 
 tinyhhj: is it going to match automatically once i submit my code?
 Zenoscave: what's the exploit Uljahn
 AntiSquid: you have 1000ms first turn too :o
 Tiramon: 52% and 3.51 score behind you struct ... damn you =)
 struct: I lost 1 battle&#160;:(
 jrke: 220th battle breached struct 100%
 struct: That I should never lose
 Lachrymosa: The people beating me appear to be completing trees earlier in the game-cycle than me
 AntiSquid: struct depth&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: sim count&#160;?
 Codeur_du_Sexe: hey
 davilla: to save the forest you have to chop it down
 AntiSquid: (ply)
 Codeur_du_Sexe: hello guys
 Denshire: "The forest starts with a nutrient value of 20" so is nutrient shared between players and decreased when either player completes a tree or is it different for the two players?
 struct: its hardcoded depth 20 it can go further
 Lachrymosa: it is a communal resource
 schachmatt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/04/out-of-control-chinese-rocket-tumbling-to-earth">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/04/out-of-control-chinese-rocket-tumbling-to-earth</a>
 KalamariKing: schachmatt heard about that, spooky
 Lachrymosa: completing a tree first will yield 20+richness modifier. The next completed tree will yield 19+richness etc.
 schachmatt: Odds of getting to silver before the world ends?
 MACKEYTH: Yay, Bronze!
 davilla: 1 to infinity plus 1
 Lachrymosa: Is silver even open? I thought it opened tomorrow?
 inoryy: it opens Monday
 Westicles: Ooh, I forgot how exciting it was when Skylab came down
 jrke: 5/10/21
 KalamariKing: what cookies can I clear without breaking anything
 Lachrymosa: Oh, well then my Bronze bot is gonna chill for quite a bit then
 Zenoscave: gz struct. you were my first loss of the submit&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave smash him!
 Zenoscave: Not anytime soon...
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave he's at nearly 100% wins
 Zenoscave: I know I was just hoping for a 30/30
 Zenoscave: 29/30 will do...
 Tiramon: no he lost one AntiSquid
 Zenoscave: *nearly*
 Tiramon: so its only 99.9 or so
 Lachrymosa: nearly*
 SabertheLost: when is next promotion?
 AntiSquid: my sim predicted your ping Tiramon
 jrke: Tiramon which is nearly 100% thats what squiddy said
 Zenoscave: WITCH HUNT
 KalamariKing: Should I continue in java or should I switch to python
 KalamariKing: I know python much better
 Lachrymosa: Heh, I beat Zenoscave
 KalamariKing: Y'all have done contests before, would python be too slow
 Zenoscave: Just saw that Lachrymosa
 Zenoscave: gg
 Lachrymosa: You using sims?
 Zenoscave: nope
 Zenoscave: not yet
 Lachrymosa: me neither, pure If-Then
 ZarthaxX: masters of if spaghetti rising
 ZarthaxX: :P
 jrke: btw anyone except struct having rule based bot/
 Lachrymosa: I'm afraid to do sims, haven't done one before
 Zenoscave: probably safe to remove the bfs now
 Tiramon: good point ... time to start build a sim
 inoryy: Zenoscave noo don't give up on it
 synchoz: whats this sim :o&#160;?
 jrke: i am looking for minimax
 Tiramon: a simulation of the game engine so you can predict more precise what a result a specific action will give
 Zenoscave: I had liek 3 people instantly message me to not remove BFS. I might keep it
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 synchoz: i see :D
 Lachrymosa: Is anyone accounting for shade yet?
 Tiramon: what was the link of the site again to look at winratio against players&#160;?
 jrke: i haven't accounted SEED yet
 struct: I fixed the bug I think
 ZarthaxX: Lachrymosa less than 4 hs into contest, calm down lol
 NinjaDoggy: why does struct have a full sim bot &lt;2 hours into the contest with bitboards? -_-
 ZarthaxX: he tested the game
 Istian: WOW, can't make my tree complete on wood 1...wtf?
 struct: I dont think I need to resubmit though
 NinjaDoggy: ohhh
 jrke: he was tester
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/Zenoscave">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/Zenoscave</a>
 Zenoscave: that one Tiramon?
 synchoz: try growing it to size of 3 
 Tiramon: yes exactly that one thks Zenoscave ... was to long ago  
 Zenoscave: yw
 Lachrymosa: :O AntiSquid  we're fighting to seed the center lol
 Zenoscave: Here's a win for you while you're at it&#160;;)
 struct: i had problems with eval
 struct: wasnt easy
 Istian: I got it to size 3, I check the size before performing an action, then if 3, complete.... but it tries to grow it anyway
 Tiramon: yeah my current bot is better than i expected =)
 Lachrymosa: same, I wasn't expecting my simple logic to actually do this well. Figured people would out-pace it hard
 CasualPotato: hey guys, my game canvas stays grey all the time and doesnßt show the game...anyone experienced the same?
 synchoz: must be someting in ur code that makes it grow again
 KalamariKing: CasualPotato same here
 KalamariKing: Nobody else seems to care tho
 Lachrymosa: Zeno's climbing!
 jrke: Tiramon is your bot rule based sim or just if else?
 KalamariKing: I'll update you with anything I can do to fix it
 Tiramon: give a replay Istian else it's hard to tell ... but i guess you give the wrong command
 CasualPotato: hmm ok thanks KalamariKing!
 CasualPotato: I'll also try to find out
 Tiramon: jrke my bit is simple some list sorting and 5 if else  blocks for the command output
 ddreams: You use the same browser, gray canvas guys?
 KalamariKing: CHrome
 CasualPotato: yeah chrome
 KalamariKing: The canvas hasn't been grey before
 Istian: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4310b28d-3f0e-417a-8477-94e2c8ca9b8b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4310b28d-3f0e-417a-8477-94e2c8ca9b8b</a>
 CasualPotato: Uhh I found out what it is! I think...
 Istian: that's the code there
 KalamariKing: Oh?
 jrke: that gave you 2nd rank cool
 ddreams: chrome://gpu/ works?
 CasualPotato: Need to turn on hardware accelartion
 KalamariKing: ddreams yeah
 CasualPotato: KalamariKing try this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.lifewire.com/hardware-acceleration-in-chrome-4125122">https://www.lifewire.com/hardware-acceleration-in-chrome-4125122</a>
 Tiramon: damn playing against myself always results in both of my bots seedings the same space ...
 MACKEYTH: Are points from leftover sun at the end of the game truncated?
 Tiramon: hard to tell if current ide is better than arena that way&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: tiramon. reverse if player 2&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: CasualPotato I can't find hardware accel in chrome://flags I think they removed it
 Tiramon: if both try to seed the center thats hard&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: true :thinking:
 Zenoscave: stop seeding the center then
 Lachrymosa: AntiSquid and I were doing that lol, 3-4 trees in a row wasting seed attempts
 Tiramon: and btw you don't know if you are p1 or p2 ... or did i miss something
 KalamariKing: Clearing cookies does nothing
 llllllllll: can I use multiple actions in a round?
 struct: you dont know
 Zenoscave: position of first trees perhaps?
 struct: unless you do a system call
 synchoz: could it be that ur tree.size is not being updated each loop&#160;?
 Queuebee: I saw someone pushed starter.cs to the starterAI's, will there be a .cpp? I want to learn C++ :D
 Lachrymosa: It shouldn't matter which player you are, moves are simultaneous
 ddreams: the starter ai's don't do anything but parse the input
 KalamariKing: clearing cache does nothing eitehr
 KalamariKing: either*
 ddreams: but there are a couple of starter c++ sets in the PRs
 Queuebee: PRs? .__.
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/pulls">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/pulls</a>
 KalamariKing: I have a question since I can't see the game screen
 ddreams: PR =&gt; Pull Request
 Queuebee: ahh thankss
 Nanosplitter: For anyone with the issue of a grey canvas and you already have hardware acceleration on, this is what worked for me:
 ddreams: try Firefox, KK?
 Nanosplitter: Disable hardware acceleration -&gt; relaunch -&gt; enable hardware acceleration -&gt; relaunch
 Nanosplitter: Now I can see the game
 LLG: struct, any pointers on how to eval?
 cegprakash: hi guys
 ddreams: I recently needed to set the Override software rendering list in chrome://flags to make gpu acceleration work again
 cegprakash: I'm streaming code escape anyone wanna join?

 cegprakash: This is a test stream before the contest actual stream
 Hjax: ah i see
 cegprakash: I want to check if audio is working fine
 KalamariKing: YES lets go
 KalamariKing: If you're on a chromebook, open a new tab with `chrome://quit` and then sign back in
 AntiSquid: cegprakash if no statment then no chat either ... 
 AntiSquid: asking chat to read statement for you is cheating
 cguzman: GROW&#160;!
 cegprakash: should I give permission for microphone for code escape
 cegprakash: what is it for
 KalamariKing: Theres a built in video call feature
 jrke: to chat you partner
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: To communicate with your team mates
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: i am sure your stream will be exciting

 jrke: try tutorial its for solo but its just of 5 mins
 Tiramon: you really want to do escape during contest?
 jrke: he is testing his stream
 jacek: he wants to escape
 Astrobytes: What happened to your reach bronze without reading statement stream?
 Lachrymosa: I mean, at this point you know people can see the stream and hear you so why not just start the contest?
 synchoz: he wants few people to escape 
 Astrobytes: Reach bronze without reading statement is only gonna be as long as the submit anyway lol
 orangesnowfox: ... wat, apparently without doing anything I get silver
 struct: wtf
 Astrobytes: the hell? Silver is open?
 struct: im silver?
 kovi: oops
 _martynas: Silver?
 jrke: silver bug?
 Scarfield: xD
 orangesnowfox: "oops"
 Beresta: lol
 orangesnowfox: bug probably
 Beresta: whole bronze gets to silver now? :D 
 jrke: lemme report
 actualCoderTrevor: damn I knew I shouldn't have done anything
 Pduhard-: wtf xD
 dbdr: classic
 AntiSquid: lol imagine boss gets pushed into next league
 Hjax: lol 
 schachmatt: boss-only platinum?
 Lachrymosa: struct's bot isn't in Bronze anymore, MOVIN ON UP!
 Astrobytes: reported
 schachmatt: *legend
 Hjax: cant say ive ever been silver on the first day of the contest before, new record :P
 jrke: i can see silver badge
 Thiesjoo: gg ez silver
 jrke: in leaderboard
 actualCoderTrevor: I'll be at the top of bronze in no time
 Thiesjoo: struct not at first place (:
 actualCoderTrevor: *near the top
 Quidome: and 100xp :D
 SinOfWrath: Aren't they usually opening silver like Mondays?
 ZarthaxX: ye
 jrke: some bug
 Quidome: this happend before
 ZarthaxX: they messed up
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Quidome: they will turn it back
 orangesnowfox: aye, it's okay, they'll reverse it :p
 Lachrymosa: 57% battles complete
 itzluku: is there a way to start at wood2 again?
 Gabbek: dafuq? promotion to silver? :O
 Hoyer: silver league
 Lachrymosa: make a new account 
 struct: poor servers&#160;:(
 Gabbek: I'm pretty much last in bronze...
 AntiSquid: was top 50 didn't get silver&#160;:(
 SinOfWrath: A fellow software engineer is losing their job at a Thursday evening. How sad. :joy:
 Extremophile: how do you submit your code
 Tiramon: what rank 1 ... did you resubmit struct?
 Lachrymosa: Are you 100% submitted AntiSquid?
 JFB: Silver league&#160;????
 AntiSquid: oh
 struct: Tiramon I was promoted to silver
 ZarthaxX: Tiramon silver opened
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Tiramon: oh ok leaderboard loaded and you left top 5 so resubmit ...
 Tiramon: oh ...
 Hoyer: all I did so far: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34e82e51-d188-4cd5-b5c7-76ace6ca81b3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34e82e51-d188-4cd5-b5c7-76ace6ca81b3</a>
 Tiramon: isn't it a bit early for silver :thinking:
 jrke: i am also promoted to silver lol
 Zenoscave: it was an "oops"
 Hjax: its only 4 days early 
 struct: but dont worry I resubmited yes
 JFB: It is a bug I assume
 Astrobytes: Clearly a bug. I reported already Tiramon.
 jacek: yeah, they should have waited for deploy friday
 struct: I added timer to avoid timeout and fixed a small thing
 Extremophile: how do you submit your code
 jrke: CG crashing a lot
 SinOfWrath: I'm worried that by this speed the contest will be over by morning. :D
 Lachrymosa: According to the league graphic ye Silver is out too early, but.... "Code uhh, finds a way"
 Thiesjoo: The bot in silver is also broken ):
 jrke: so struct will be winner till morning lol
 Thiesjoo: cannot test my code anymore
 jrke: everybody just to be safe
 DimSumSaying: maybe we can promote to gold in another hour
 jrke: save your codes
 Astrobytes: Have patience everyone
 Scarfield: ^
 XeroOl: how do I get into legend yet&#160;:)
 jrke: i think it would be better to close CG for now
 jrke: gn i am going
 Tiramon: and so many 504 again ...
 XeroOl: I need to get the local editor working
 XeroOl: so I can work on this offline
 AntiSquid: everyone hold hands and say a prayer, bugs will be fixed soon
 XeroOl: is there a good way to run the game offline?
 dreadylein: yay leauge speedrun ;D
 JP7: Anyone else experiencing this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/OAYApuq">https://imgur.com/a/OAYApuq</a>
 schachmatt: Odds of reaching Silver before the world ends just increased dramatically :innocent:
 JP7: Is very strange, because that asset has already been loaded as far as I can tell
 Michael_Howard: lol I just leveled up from silver XP. My bot is just harvest or grow the first tree.
 Bernard_Lowe: I can't get the codinggame GUI to display the grid visually. Can anyone please help?
 Bernard_Lowe: I took off all my chrome extensions and reloaded.
 Hjax: schachmatt maybe we are silver because the world is ending 
 struct: have you tried enabling hardware accelaration? 
 dreadylein: 2k people in the league after 4 hours, not bad
 jrke: btw also promotion didn't occured rank wise
 schachmatt: Hjax did CG do this to ramp up the pressure? :open_mouth:
 jrke: or maybe there code was computing
 Bernard_Lowe: Yes, I have hardware acceleration on. Still no in-game GUI to show the map.
 Bernard_Lowe: I was able to display the map in the last Fall competition no problem.
 JP7: Console logs?
 Astrobytes: CG STAFF ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND ARE LOOKING INTO IT :eyes:
 JP7: anything obviously broken?
 JP7: (Bernard)
 Astrobytes: (sorry for caps, just to be heard)
 JP7: I am forever deaf now, ty much
 JP7: :P
 jrke: will they demote us to bronze?
 jrke: probably yes
 ZarthaxX: prob
 jrke: gn
 Zenoscave: they already are working on it
 schachmatt: could they wait like 10 minutes I'm 6% away from silver
 struct: just promote me to gold
 Astrobytes: Like when we all went to Gold that time
 Tiramon: hope not ... also i'm not sure if i'm in silver yet ...
 BlaiseEbuth: They're looking the issues Astrobytes, but do they try to solve them&#160;?
 Zenoscave: have faith, guys...
 Tiramon: atleast i got no notification =)
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: I speak only that of which I know
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 BlaiseEbuth: One day, CG will manage to make a contest without bugs... Perhaps by passing to an unique contest by year? The current six months seems not to be enough to prepare.&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Are there 13,339 in the leaderboard?
 struct: ok, im back to my rank
 Tiramon: and it's definitly not the first contest they've done ... so i hope it was just something new and not being unprepared
 fvla: I'd rather have slightly buggy contests twice than perfect contests once a year
 fvla: It's not like it's literally unplayably broken or something, just technical hiccups
 Lachrymosa: ^
 struct: oh
 Tiramon: sad ... was a nice 1st place in bronze&#160;;)
 struct: no
 struct: there is a silver boss?
 GrekMaR: Love myself some 504s
 Tiramon: stil 1st in bronze&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll prefer have two perfect contests

 SwagColoredKitteh: hoi struct
 AntiSquid: hello SwissToto
 Lachrymosa: SwagColoredKitteh thats a name I haven't seen in a while
 SwagColoredKitteh: hey inoryy long time no see
 eulerscheZahl: silver?
 AntiSquid: SwagColoredKitteh *
 Michael_Howard: How do u get -1 points?
 Astrobytes: kitteh qteh
 SwagColoredKitteh: hoi Lachrymosa
 fvla: Here I am still waiting to be promoted out of Wood 2 lol
 SwagColoredKitteh: no u qt uwu
 eulerscheZahl: and a full resubmit too :D
 Tiramon: wow 328 to silverby accicent ... ouch
 fvla: Started a bit late
 Tiramon: *accident
 Lachrymosa: Michael_Howard you err
 Nerchio: so do they just leave silver on now
 SwagColoredKitteh: i just submitted for the first time and my bot just completes the first tree it sees in the list of trees :D
 Tiramon: no idea Nerchio
 eulerscheZahl: is SaisyApo messing around?
 inoryy: SwagColoredKitteh yeah no kidding! how's it going?&#160;:)
 Tiramon: all with stable rank havegone to silver i guess
 SwagColoredKitteh: well, surviving i guess, the pandemic made things quite hard for me&#160;:'D
 struct: yeah
 SwagColoredKitteh: how are you?
 Lachrymosa: 68% submission :V
 inoryy: mostly working, trying to resist the contest
 SwagColoredKitteh: :D
 Astrobytes: 2 - 3 liner for bronze inoryy
 Queuebee: must.. pat... can't... resist
 Tiramon: don't resist inoryy come to the contest we have wifi and cookies
 SwagColoredKitteh: i am here for the contest
 ZarthaxX: SWAGOOOOOOOOOOOO
 fvla: Wood 2 is mindnumbingly boring, all I can do is read chat
 VizGhar: Hey guys&#160;:)  how's contest? I'm starting tomorrow, just curious about your impressions
 Hjax: it looks better than pacman at least 
 Lachrymosa: Its a fun game :3 sims will be needed for higher levels
 Non0: easy to play, hard to master
 GrekMaR: its buggy :D
 AntiSquid: VizGhar tomorrow is too late, people are already in silver
 fvla: Interesting board game concept that doesn't seem to have RPS
 inoryy: Astrobytes I have the basic bot in already, just trying not to get pulled into writing a sim
 Astrobytes: [C G] Thibaud — Today at 7:18 PMwe're working on it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c61ab54-1a2b-443f-ab33-a76774e8403f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c61ab54-1a2b-443f-ab33-a76774e8403f</a>
 VizGhar: silver? :D dafuq?
 fvla: AntiSquid lmaoooo
 eulerscheZahl: hmpf
 Astrobytes: Ah gotcha inoryy
 fvla: VizGhar it's a bug
 eulerscheZahl: Hjax 08:19PMit looks better than pacman at least 
 Hjax: you dont like it euler?
 struct: euler you dont like it?
 SwagColoredKitteh: i just need to make sure i don't open the black hole that is openttd
 eulerscheZahl: I liked pacman
 SwagColoredKitteh: that game sucks me in and i will come out 1 month in the future
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow I don'T feel this contest so far
 eulerscheZahl: might change but right now i wonder why I took some days off for it
 struct: I think the contest has some limitations, but Im not good enough to prove it
 VizGhar: ah. just reach legend and leave better places for us
 inoryy: struct limitations?
 Passifi: so now i am in the race too and right away I am greeted by a clock reminding me that live is too short and the pressure of only having 10 days is making my brain freeze 
 llllllllll: hmmmm, 100ms instead of 50?!
 struct: in terms of strategy 
 struct: But I think that applies to all the games
 VizGhar: 100ms... thats a lot
 Hjax: this game does seem like more of a typical board game than most contests 
 Nerchio: am i the only one that thinks you have to look too deep to figure out if your moves are good or not
 struct: Nerchio I go depth 20
 VizGhar: maybe they want to help non-c coders to reach top 20
 AntiSquid: finally silver \o/
 Hjax: struct youre bluffing right
 struct: no
 Scarfield: wow, heavy pruning?
 struct: Im using Beam search
 VizGhar: if thats minimax struct you da boss
 struct: I ignore enemy
 VizGhar: :D
 Tiramon: oh now i stabalized and got also promoted to silver
 Hjax: ah i see 
 eulerscheZahl: maximax
 Tiramon: CG should really add a safety measure if league is open without boss ...
 llllllllll: maxmax
 AntiSquid: how can you ignore enemy when they cast shadows&#160;? 
 VizGhar: :D maximax is nice term
 VizGhar: his eval simply ignores shadows
 struct: I ignore that enemy can make actions
 SwagColoredKitteh: my bot gonna be casting shade
 AntiSquid: ok struct that makes sense
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/57f983b8-2569-46ab-b60f-0e6b3fdc891a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/57f983b8-2569-46ab-b60f-0e6b3fdc891a</a>
 schachmatt: Tiramon if you stabilise in legend you get promoted to league -1 and get root access to CG servers
 llllllllll: who cares about the enemy anyways
 Manchi_o6o7: my code isn't printing for some reason
 Michael_Howard: *gets ready to plant trees around struct's bot*
 SwagColoredKitteh: i am currently still in the process of trying to learn to type properly so i am very slow at writing code&#160;:(
 MadKnight: anyone using swift&#160;?
 MadKnight: what do u guys use to run/test swift code locally&#160;?
 SwagColoredKitteh: i'm rewriting it all in rust as i usually do
 Michael_Howard: MadKnight I just debug in the IDE like a maniac.
 AllanOricil: what happens when a tree casts shadow?
 MadKnight: Michael_Howard no that's not a maniac thing
 AllanOricil: I dont see anything about it in the game definition
 Istian: Why is complete not firing here? 
 Istian: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/59cc5f65-c1f7-4984-b251-f9913393edf0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/59cc5f65-c1f7-4984-b251-f9913393edf0</a>
 MadKnight: using in-browser IDE is a maniac thing Michael_Howard
 struct: the trees affected by the shadow do not gather sun points
 llllllllll: it is in the description for sure
 Michael_Howard: MadKnight that's what I meant
 AllanOricil: what is the direction of the shadow?
 WolfDarrigan: Istian, did you grow the tree this round?
 AllanOricil: there is no input for it
 llllllllll: Same as the sun
 RoboStac: it's day&#160;% 6
 rmuskovets: MadKnight well the kotlin language assist is not *that* bad so pretty much usable...
 Lachrymosa: I've only ever used the in-browser IDE for this website &gt;:D
 kurtesy: :atom:
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 what a maniac...
 Automaton2000: is there a way for me to get to silver
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://www.twitch.tv/cegprakash</a> Live now!!

 Smelty: o.o
 MadKnight: cegpralive
 cegprakash: C++ stream&#160;:)
 cegprakash: please join&#160;:)
 Michael_Howard: Automaton2000 Yes, I think even you could get it today&#160;:)
 Automaton2000: lol i just leveled up from silver xp. my bot is less than 1 ms
 AllanOricil: oh I see
 AllanOricil: the sun rotates in the hexagon
 AllanOricil: its direction are the arrows
 davilla: "replay in same conditions" doesn't replay in same conditions... hate debugging games like this
 Hjax: automaton with the oddly relevant message 
 Istian: WolfDarrigan, it never fires. It actually tries to grow trees that are size 3.
 geio: the algorithm of boss is too bad&#160;? is that somany advance to next leagues very soon&#160;?
 Astrobytes: geio: Bug, staff are working on it.
 geio: oh ok
 Tiramon: afaik there is no boss, thats why everyone with a stable rank gets promoted
 Manchi_o6o7: if someone can help me why isn't this printing
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/93ac2ef0-1618-4255-8e27-1ba25812a8f3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/93ac2ef0-1618-4255-8e27-1ba25812a8f3</a>
 geio: it is a dot
 geio: not ,
 Smelty: hmm
 Tiramon: because your indentation is hard to read ... no thats only why it takes me longer to see the real error
 geio: there is syntax error&#160;? in printf&#160;?
 LordSkaven: why is the website telling me I am in silver league?
 Tiramon: because there is a bug
 VizGhar: Manchi_o6o7 either build error, runetime crash  or n &lt;= 0
 Tiramon: that is knwon to the cg guys
 Tiramon: everyone with a stable rank in bronze gets the promotion
 WolfDarrigan: Istian, I'd suggest printing the tree.size out to err and see if it is what you expect it to be then
 Tusen: Why is it that my rank drops once i go out of the Arena? Like i was just around 100, i went out, dropped to 200 somehow?
 geio: good bots played with u
 Tusen: I'm literally winning every fight
 Tusen: Maybe lose like 1/10
 Brunin: or lucky bots xd
 Tiramon: and because ranking is a bit broken right nowbut normally it is because you lost against better bots
 Tusen: Last 16 matches i lost 2.
 Scarfield: when you resubmit, you start over from "the bottom of your current league" ish
 struct: My bot is almost lasting 5 hours
 Istian: WolfDarrigan yeah, did. It is as expected.
 Tiramon: because the page is broken right now&#160;;)
 Tiramon: and the ranking games are slow
 eulerscheZahl: they added 300 more bots to the running submits
 eulerscheZahl: of course it's slow
 Tiramon: 300 growing ...
 Lachrymosa: 87% complete :V
 Wontonimo: hmm, i'm surprised that the game doesn't do an early quit when one player has no trees left and the other player is ahead in score.  
 davilla: you can always hold out for an illegal instruction &lt;crosses fingers&gt;
 Tiramon: damn 147:120 i'm getting closer but i don't reach you =)
 Wontonimo: time to go make a sandwich
 KelvinAndHubbles: Haven't played contests in a bit, doesn't new leagues get released every day and that's why the max are at silver?
 AntiSquid: when struct gets 100% gold opens :D
 eulerscheZahl: what's that tiramon? benchmark with 250 games?
 geio:  :taco:
 Tiramon: no silver should have been release on monday ... they got a bug
 struct: There is a silver boss
 struct: gold will open 100%
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Tiramon: no just the end scores of one game =)
 struct: im missing 30 exp for level 30
 AntiSquid: TONIGHT WE DINE IN LEGEND Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: at least you know the number of digits
 Tiramon: silver boss? so now the broke it completly?
 struct: so Im hoping gold opens
 Astrobytes: A race against time
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/RKPN5R2">https://imgur.com/RKPN5R2</a>
 SabertheLost: woohoo, promoted
 Wontonimo: woot!  easiest gold ever
 Tiramon: ok so no resubmit just stab the rank
 Wontonimo: lol
 davilla: I like the irony of this challenge... to get ahead you have to cut down the trees on the most arable land, just like in real life
 eulerscheZahl: a crashing boss, even I can beat that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what ranking is the bronze boss?
 Astrobytes: 42
 eulerscheZahl: damn you laggy crowded chat
 Wontonimo: there is a bronze boss?
 struct: There isnt
 struct: its just bugged
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's what i thought
 struct: blame the testers
 struct: They should have made me bronze boss to gatekeep
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps struct around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/62856860719935" /> KalamariKing: struct if you were bronze bot, very few people would get past
 Astrobytes: Nah, that's CG's end. But I'll blame you anyway since you volunteer
 struct: I think my bot would get placed gold
 struct: if I didnt touch it
 AntiSquid: game is hex, it must be struct's fault
 eulerscheZahl: legend or delete
 AntiSquid: maybe he gets legend today through euler
 Tiramon: and no struct gnoxo is not a boss it's just a player with a boss picture
 Lachrymosa: *DONK DONK* Special Victims Coding Unit.Talking to Struct's Code: And can you point on this doll where Struct touched you?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a simple change like seeding a lower index number gained me like 300 ranks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: silly stuff
 eulerscheZahl: if they keep going, we can do "no sleep till legend" today already
 Astrobytes: Lachrymosa: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: "Sit at your desk til legend"
 Lachrymosa: I'm already a fuckin Legend :V
 Astrobytes: Or "watch on your phone 'til legend"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wondering if i hit rank 100 in bronze if it'll level to silver
 Rabeeb: battling takes too long
 Wontonimo: tacos till leagend
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops talked too soon
 Lachrymosa: Wontonimo if I deliberately fail I have infinite tacos? DEAL
 Hjax: are there any resources on hex bitboards? i know this isnt the first hex board game on this site 
 AntiSquid: redblobgames
 Astrobytes: Only if Wontonimo is paying for the tacos
 piegusek37: only I have a problem that I can't see the video from the game, only a gray screen?
 jacek: oO
 KalamariKing: A few of us have had that
 AntiSquid: nvm misread
 Astrobytes: Hjax: the bitboard methods for games has something iirc
 KalamariKing: jac​ek here didn't help
 Lachrymosa: Yo what the D: my battle completed&#160;% just got reset and I'm still in bronze?
 Wontonimo: virtual tacos for everyone on me!
 Tiramon: oh silver is growing and shrinking ...
 Tiramon: only 3 in silver according to my leaderboard&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: piegusek37 if you're on chrome --&gt; disable hardware accel, relaunch, enable, relaunch
 Marchete: ouch erro -1
 KalamariKing: Or try chrome://quit
 Astrobytes: Also Hjax: not sure I see much bitboarding opportunity. Packing yes
 Marchete: error -1
 Wontonimo: yup, everyone in bronze now
 Gabbek: anyone having:An error occurred (#-1): "internal error".all the time now?
 Hjax: Astrobytes at least you can compute all shadows with a bitshift
 struct: time to delete&#160;:(
 piegusek37: thanks
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/pGTkoqK.png">https://i.imgur.com/pGTkoqK.png</a>
 Wontonimo: bye bye silver&#160;;( 
 Hoyer: i cant enter the ide anymore
 Astrobytes: Fair Hjax
 Hoyer: An error occurred (#-1): "internal error".
 Asterixk: my code can't even seed i can't be silver
 Tiramon: guess they are currently fixing ... but some statement would be nice
 DumbassDan: Same @Hoyer
 Wontonimo: oh no, my code and everyone else's has just restarted ranking
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, my&#160;% started over
 Wontonimo: crazy town
 DumbassDan: Can't access IDE anymore either sadly
 AntiSquid: can't enter IDE either annoying
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm #1 in php...for a minute, lol
 Marchete: my code is a sort with a simplistic score
 Marchete: shouldn't be silve
 Hjax: silver is closed now 
 DumbassDan: Guess they are fixing that?
 Wontonimo: i think the 180-200 games per test in bronze is overkill considering there isn't FoW or any real randomness
 davilla: so did anyone get a peek at the silver rules?
 Asterixk: everyone rollback to wood2
 Hjax: davilla no new rules in silver
 struct: silver rules are the same
 davilla: cool thanks
 Wontonimo: thanks struct
 DumbassDan: @Wontonimo, I mean, the board is randomised each time, with dead spots too
 davilla: still chopping down trees on the most arable land, good to know
 WesCraterMadman: are there any rules later that aren't just completely implementing photosynthesis? :stuck_out_tongue:
 Tiramon: bronze are final rules
 Astrobytes: Everything is :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 KelvinAndHubbles: when did the contest even start?
 WesCraterMadman: this morning
 Wontonimo: DumbassDan yeah, but once you see the board, the game is set.  There is nothing to chance other than your opponents moves
 Tiramon: almost 5h ago
 SirLoxley: is there a simple algorithm to compute the neighbour indexes? By trying a few I haven't found anything obvious ... I suppose in later leagues this matters, so I would like to start early
 BigUP: vous etes parti de quel code de contest pour le spring challenge&#160;?
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/KGa3W47W">https://pastebin.com/KGa3W47W</a> ok so im tryig to program something where i can turn on and off my light with my voice. everytime i run my code the off statement works perfectly but the run statement runs anytime it can hear you or i say on can someone help
 davilla: I think it gives you the neighbors in the input... or if it doesn't, it will
 ddreams: SirLoxley just make a lookup table from the initial input?
 Astrobytes: SirLoxley: You are given the neighbour indices 
 Wontonimo: SirLoxley the neighbour indexes are given
 WolfDarrigan: SirLoxley, the neighbors are provided
 Wontonimo: everyone is so helpful
 AntiSquid: SirLoxley you get the neighbour idx
 SirLoxley: Ok, reassuring, so I won't waste my time on some formula which doesn't matter&#160;:-)
 Tiramon: one more reason why local ide is preferable on contest start days
 AntiSquid: ya well shit, locked out
 Gabbek: same here, guess it's time to take a break&#160;:)
 DumbassDan: Break time&#160;:)
 Tiramon: keep building the sim and improve strategy&#160;;)
 geio: how my tree become dormant
 AntiSquid: was setting up the board
 ddreams: sleepy tree
 AntiSquid: overengineering 
 orangesnowfox: oooh, bronze again, fun
 Tiramon: a tree gets dormant if it has done a action on that day
 SirLoxley: Should have looked in the provided github code, it's there
 CasualPotato: geio when you perform an action to on the day
 Thiesjoo: Code wiped ):
 Wontonimo: hey orangesnowfox it's been a while.  
 orangesnowfox: Wontonimo, just a few hours, no?
 AntiSquid: lol Thiesjoo&#160;? wtf&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: err, no, it's been a while
 Thiesjoo: I got in the IDE
 orangesnowfox: my memory sucks lol
 Thiesjoo: back to bronze
 Wontonimo: i just got here
 Thiesjoo: but all my code is gone
 struct: Im back Tiramon&#160;:)
 Scarfield: yea mine reverted back to default code as well
 ddreams: Thiesjoo look in History
 Thiesjoo: Oh but history is there
 Thiesjoo: And i have backups aswell
 Astrobytes: Mine was reset to D but my C++ is still there when I change back
 AntiSquid: WELL FK ...&#160;:/ 
 Tiramon: i will get you anyway ... sooner or later .. i'm so close with 5 ifs ...
 AntiSquid: mine's gone
 ddreams: Look in history
 AntiSquid: ffs ...
 ddreams: assuming you posted it
 orangesnowfox: Lesson of the day: Don't code in the ide?
 WolfDarrigan: Just copied all my code as a precaution :sweat_smile:
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/546953785">https://www.codingame.com/replay/546953785</a>
 Zenoscave: I'm comming...
 AntiSquid: no it's not in history, was switching to C++ ....
 ddreams: uff
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/KGa3W47W">https://pastebin.com/KGa3W47W</a> ok so im tryig to program something where i can turn on and off my light with my voice. everytime i run my code the off statement works perfectly but the run statement runs anytime it can hear you or i say on can someone help
 Tiramon: for those missing the code ... there is the history on the left side where you can restore your last submit
 struct: oh no, I just started at 1st rank with 4% of battles computed
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: different language, not my code T_T
 struct: How far will I go?
 Tiramon: i'm at 1% and right behind you ...
 Wontonimo: they have confidence in you struct
 struct: it just moved to 86 o.o
 Zenoscave: 86% here too
 JormaW: is there a way to see what challenge you were trying in the clash of code?
 Zenoscave: with 1 game
 Tiramon: oh yes mine too =)
 Astrobytes: Nice and ruthless Tiramon (the kick) :D
 JormaW: i wouldve loved to try and solve it but time ran out
 Zenoscave: JormaW there's an active competition. Not many will help with CoC rn
 Thiesjoo: IDE is quick again for me
 Tiramon: 1.67 behind you still to much
 Wontonimo: hey, maybe they changed the number of battles per submit in bronze
 WolfDarrigan: only took an hour of battles, but finally made it to bronze :sweat_smile:
 Zenoscave: Tiramon did you see my replay?
 KalamariKing: JormaW I do not think so&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/546953785">https://www.codingame.com/replay/546953785</a>
 JormaW: Too bad&#160;:&lt;
 Tiramon: not yet
 Hoggins: how current challange game is called?
 Tiramon: so it helped =)
 Tiramon: or was a lucky round
 Zenoscave: spring challenge 2021
 eulerscheZahl: Spring Challenge 2021 @Hoggins
 orangesnowfox: dang, 504 again
 Astrobytes: Hoggins: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 Zenoscave: Tiramon definitely a lucky shot
 Zenoscave: You still beat me quite a bit
 Hoggins: hm... I thought there should be some cool tame like CoC ))
 xMizar: Hi guys, can you seed or grow?
 Tiramon: lost 2 out of 227 thats ok
 orangesnowfox: In wood 1, bronze respectively, yes.
 Tiramon: xMizar depends on your current league
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/832610056604221481/839865156607541258/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/832610056604221481/839865156607541258/unknown.png</a>photosynthesis
 eulerscheZahl: as someone on discord mentioned
 geio: from leader board how can i find position of boss
 xMizar: I'm in Wood
 WesCraterMadman: it's a pretty fun game
 Tiramon: wood 2 complete, waitwood 1 complete, grow, waitbronze complete, grow, seed, wait
 Thiesjoo: Hmmmm battles are really slow 
 WesCraterMadman: when do shadows come in?
 xMizar: @Tiramon, ahhh, thanks
 Lachrymosa: Thiesjoo Bronzee
 Astrobytes: *WesCraterMadman Bronze&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: ftfy
 Tiramon: great and my lost games seam just to be broken computations
 ddreams: what are the numbers you're outputting struct?
 Tiramon: wait i make valid moves and my enemy does not five in action in time and it results in a tie?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/546962970">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/546962970</a>
 struct: ammount of trees of 0-3 height
 Tiramon: *give
 struct: That I own
 ddreams: I see
 xMizar: Just out of interest, why did you limit wood 2 as complete and wait only? It's impossible to write any normal strategy
 Lizerino: is anyone else getting a warning your code did not read all available input when using c#
 Astrobytes: QUESTION FROM STAFF: ANY CURRENT ISSUES FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN SLOW SUBMITS?
 ddreams: Lizerino, don't break until you've read all the input
 xMizar: @Lizerino - yes
 Tiramon: wood leagues are tutorial leagues ...
 xMizar: @Tiramon, i did tutorial, i want to do real business&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Sporadic 504's Astrobytes but I feel those are replay related
 DumbassDan: AstroBytes yeah, the code in the IDE is gone, lucky I have it saved locally&#160;:)
 Tiramon: xMizar wood leagues are easy
 Astrobytes: Cool DumbassDan, and yep, that's known Zenoscave, thanks 
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: do your own trees cast shadows on your own trees?
 Zenoscave: I'm scrolling through the manual but there's a lot...
 WesCraterMadman: They do in the boardgame
 Zenoscave: And in this version?
 DumbassDan: Now I'm being kicked out of the IDE again&#160;:(
 sourlime: Hey I keep getting internal error when trying to enter the game.
 Hjax: yes they do
 Hjax: a spooky shadow is always spooky 
 Hjax: regardless of whose tree made it 
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 Scarfield: Zeno, last part of "Sun and Shadows": They will find the shadow on a cell spooky if any of the trees casting a shadow is of equal or greater size than the tree on that cell. 
 Scarfield: oh im slow
 KalamariKing: sourlime try closing and coming back? clearing cookies? clearing cache? irdk
 Astrobytes: Everything seeeeems OK on my end
 sourlime: same issue from a different computer
 Lachrymosa: submission speed greatly increased
 Tiramon: except that suns are scored after invalid moves why people doing invalid moves can win games everything is fine
 [CG]jupoulton2: Hello, so sorry for all the problems, we're patching things up as fast as we can
 ddreams: shit happens, as they say
 Scarfield: ^
 Lachrymosa: I'm just happy to be here
 geio: we all :kissing_heart:
 Kumbi: can you rewatch the game, with debug active?
 Lachrymosa: you can pull the specific replay settings into the IDE and troubleshoot to your heart's content
 Tiramon: you can even send it to your ide as long as you don't have random stuff in it, it should give the same result  Kumbi
 Tiramon: fascinating i win almost all games and still my rank is dropping ...
 particleflux: Actually, why isn't this connected with discord?
 Tiramon: and i'm droping even further ...
 DumbassDan: Same
 DumbassDan: Understand the devs are under pressure though, no worries
 Tiramon: yes but i lost 3out of 474 games&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: At a certian point trueskill will round you down
 DumbassDan: I'm actually surprised how well my simple bot is doing
 DumbassDan: It has like 3 bits of logic, that's it
 AntiSquid: lol IDE lockout again :D
 Tiramon: mine has 5 ifs&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: what league DumbassDan&#160;?
 AntiSquid: saved my shit though
 AntiSquid: GUYS SAVE YOUR STUFF TO LOCAL FILE&#160;! just in case
 DumbassDan: Bronze, 32nd right now, was 10th earlier&#160;:(
 Tiramon: well 6 forgot the one aside the command choosing
 DumbassDan: Nice, well maybe if I add 3 more ifs I can be as good as you
 Tiramon: damn so many battle computing right now that i get battled all the time and still no progress on my battles&#160;;)
 SabertheLost: how to tell what day in the game (outside the code)
 Wontonimo: my battles have completed.
 ddreams: outside the code?
 SabertheLost: in the emulator aka
 ddreams: the day is given to you
 ddreams: not sure what you mean
 SabertheLost: yes, but I do not want to print it to see what they it does stuff.&#160;:) I want to hower over the board with my mouse.
 DumbassDan: I get it, when debuggng it is hard to know what day you are on
 Wontonimo: yeah, looks like Bronze has been changed to 100 battles per submit to Arena
 ddreams: the day is the turn?
 SabertheLost: oh, I thougth it was 1 day was 6 turns. 
 SabertheLost: is there only a bronze league? how can i be ranked 60 if so?
 ddreams: you're a pro
 MadKnight: don't tell him that
 SabertheLost: what? harvest, if not then grow, then if not seed? 
 Scarfield: the day represents the direction of the sun
 Astrobytes: Sunfield
 Asterixk: yay i'm bronze again and the 3 if's are gone :p
 Asterixk: no they aren't. they still in history
 AllanOricil: yes
 Tiramon: you can always restore your last submit from history
 geio: submission with printing error output doesn't matter right&#160;?
 davilla: damn I never knew that
 davilla: history
 geio: xD
 davilla: geio on other puzzles I've had it time out if it prints too much to stderr
 geio: :o
 cdude: For the new challenge I am getting a grey screen for the viewer. It doesn't ever show loading. I tried it for a past challenge and that worked fine. Does anyone know what's wrong?
 particleflux: Apparently it's a known issue and they're working on a fix
 cdude: Thanks, does a different browser fix it? If so ill have to download one
 particleflux: yes, try that. For me it doesn't work in ff but in chromium, but I've read reports of the exact opposite
 Tiramon: guess the answer is 'it's complicated'
 davilla: someone posted something earlier about hardware acceleration, not sure if that was related
 cdude: yeah, im on chromium so ill try ff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ff works, waterfox doesn't
 PatrickMcGinnisII: haven't tried the new VMware version
 eulerscheZahl: wild speculations: they updated from pixi4 to pixi5 (that's the JS libraryto show the animations)
 eulerscheZahl: maybe hardware support is reduced in that pixi5
 Tiramon: ff is working for me right now
 Zenoscave: same here for ff
 Scarfield: ff no issues, not even 504 for maybe 20mins
 MoMaT: @cdude, make sure you allow writing to canvas (this could be used for fingerprinting and Firefox will block it).
 fvla: FF was giving me 504 at the beginning, but nothing else
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think it's the CSS, when certain browsers encounter objects without certain properties set they don't render beyond a box
 schachmatt: i was busy for an hour or two what did I miss
 schachmatt: oh we're back in bronze
 KalamariKing: Yeah but force-quitting the browser and going back in will fix it PatrickMcGinnisII
 [CG]jupoulton2: I'm attempting to fix all outstanding IDE issues
 KalamariKing: epic
 Tiramon: atleast ff also has a cg local extension =)
 KalamariKing: How does cg determine a tie
 cdude: thanks guys, just finished downloading ff and signing in and it looks to be working great
 Zenoscave: new bot-fix Tiramon?
 Zenoscave: See a recent submit
 KalamariKing: It shows both players as first but what determines whose name/pfp is highlighted
 Lizerino: im not printing until after all the inputs and still i get Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, 
 KalamariKing: Me too, idk what it is
 fvla: KalamariKing Don't think it matters who is highlighted, I think you're always highlighted if it's a tie?
 KalamariKing: Printing an input() gives a number, the first one 0 and the second one fluctuating between 18 and 19
 KalamariKing: fvla oh I saw that the highlighting switched between first and second pos in a tie, so I assumed otherwise
 KalamariKing: These battles take foreverrr
 Tiramon: just made a resubmit to fix my beeing downranked while winning problem zeno =)
 fvla: it does, go grab a snack and coffee
 Zenoscave: gotcha. Well you down ranked me again&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: def got a bug somewhere
 struct: please  dont push me down yet
 struct: I need to hit the 6 hours mark
 Westicles: What's that drug college kids use to help focus for finals?  I need that to read this thing
 Zenoscave: you have 16 min?
 schachmatt: legend people problems
 Zenoscave: adderall?
 eulerscheZahl: that's just how trueskill works
 eulerscheZahl: about confidence how strong you are
 eulerscheZahl: if you win vs a really bad player, you might have lost some skills. just not enough to lose the game
 Scarfield: still undefeated struct?
 Zenoscave: ritalin?
 Astrobytes: Meth?
 Tiramon: don't think my current code will push you anywhere ... i'm still loosing against you struct
 ddreams: 6 hour mark for what?
 Zenoscave: Well a Meth salt
 WesCraterMadman: All the add drugs are just a different flavor of meth anyway
 KalamariKing: Tiramon losing
 AllanOricil: How can I see debug logs?
 Astrobytes: Hillbilly crank FTW
 Tiramon: you know what i meant
 struct: Scarfield I lost 1 battle
 struct: and then fixed my bot
 KalamariKing: ok actually why
 Tiramon: i'm a bit torn between doing one more if to get 1st or start writing a sim =)
 KalamariKing: some people wait after the first couple moves
 KalamariKing: why
 particleflux: wood leagues are really simple this time, hu?
 KalamariKing: particle yeah
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 synchoz: thats it silver bug is fixed i wasnt here for like few hours :o 
 CasualPotato: Do trees in the shadow also cast a shadow?
 struct: yes
 KalamariKing: I'm gonna say yes
 Scarfield: nice, if you end in top 20 will you get a t-shirt, or are testers not getting any prices at all?
 CasualPotato: Thanks!
 struct: no shirt
 Zenoscave: no they can test for free
 struct:&#160;:(
 struct: Maybe I can bribe someone
 KalamariKing: there should be a second leaderboard without testers, str​uct here was practically done when the contest started
 struct: trading referee for tshirt
 Zenoscave: nice morals struct
 KalamariKing: Btw why are there trailing inputs?
 eulerscheZahl: but whom to bribe?
 eulerscheZahl: you have to find someone who can use it for top20
 struct: im not done
 eulerscheZahl: and with enough moral flexibility
 struct: Also testing vs itself is not the same
 struct: my bot is weak
 Astrobytes: "Moral flexibility" :D
 KalamariKing: Even with the boilerplate, you can add extra inputs or reads or whatever and there will be more numbers. why
 Octodone: Do you guys can send a link that explain the ranking/point system&#160;? thx
 KalamariKing: the last lines should be possible moves I thought? not numbers
 eulerscheZahl: Octodone <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a>
 Octodone: awesome

 Scarfield: upgrading to fakeSkill soon?
 Astrobytes: falseSkill
 Astrobytes: Overinflated ranking system
 Scarfield: xD
 Hoyer: do u guys write search algo with various optimizations from the start? or do u write it in a human-readable way at first and then apply optimization methods?
 geio: yay promoted to bronze 
 particleflux: that trueskill stuff is licensed o.O
 MadKnight: my browser just decided to crash because it ran out of memory
 WesCraterMadman: hey maybe this is a dumb question, but how do I save a copy of the gamestate so I can restore it later after running some simulation? I'm using python
 Zenoscave: tiramon quit beating up my bot
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 what do i do with it? let's go fix it
 Automaton2000: i dont think its possible to make a class for that
 Tiramon: nice bot ftpud
 JohnnyLuke: Wes, I would just keep track of the state from the beginning
 Tiramon: i only hit you 3 times Zenoscave
 JohnnyLuke: ig you are doing python though, i wouldnt run simulations
 Hoyer: Automaton2000 how do I fix laziness
 Automaton2000: any idea how to code for the other
 Zenoscave: that's the most anyone has -_-
 KalamariKing: WesCraterMadman wdym?
 MadKnight: Hoyer just start doing CSB
 Zenoscave: 3/33 is a lot
 TobiasA: bruh struct is first
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 that was supposed to be a joke about something else 
 Automaton2000: and i'm in the same situation
 natofp: how does output behave when you print multiple instructions, where is some tutorial about it?
 KalamariKing: WesCraterMadman if you go to settings --&gt; mode=EXPERT then there should be a 'send to ide' button that will let you do that
 Hoyer: MadKnight it feels impossible to improve in CSB
 TobiasA: i can't believe i am in the same chat as someone who is first on this site
 MadKnight: just use -3vel Hoyer
 Scarfield: xD
 TobiasA: fan boy mode activated
 Tiramon: just pring one command per loop and you are fine
 Zenoscave: -3.25 vel is better
 Scarfield: -Pi vel the best
 Hoyer: I'm already #28 MadKnight I doubt -vel is gonna help me
 Zenoscave: knew it
 Zenoscave: fix it. ezpz
 Scarfield: xD
 Hoyer: is -3vel the secret to enter top 20
 Zenoscave: Wouldn't know not top 20&#160;;)
 WesCraterMadman: I want to write a function to simulate scores if I take certain actions, but I don't know how to save what the current state is, short of using deepcopy. And that feels inelegant and probably bad
 struct: I havent gotten any battles in a while
 struct: I think ill resubmit
 struct: Probably a bug
 Zenoscave: have state apply/unapply functinos WesCraterMadman
 WesCraterMadman: Ooh that's an idea
 Maliamnon:  do trees in spooky shadows cast their own shadows?
 WesCraterMadman: thanks
 struct: yes Maliamnon
 Maliamnon: ty
 JLukeSkywalker: using python for any of that is inelegant and bad
 WesCraterMadman: yeah, well I don't know anything else
 JLukeSkywalker:&#160;:(
 fvla: bitboard?
 inoryy: you can do poor man's bitboards in python with numpy
 fvla: yeah
 FdevM: I'm feeling a little bad about not being able to solve even the easy puzzles, what would you recommend me to do?
 Lizerino: ive got no writelines before any readlines.. if i put another readline before my first writeline i get an error that im not taking an action in time.. wth is happening
 Scarfield: python is too slow to get any results with search/simulations, if you want to learn about and use search algos, you almost have to learn a faster language with the CG time limitations
 fvla: putting another readline means you're waiting for an input that never comes
 barbora: if a player grows a tree, does the shadow get larger right after the grow action? Or does it get larger on the next day?
 Lizerino: and still its says that im printing before reading all the inputs
 inoryy: next day
 DumbassDan: @Scarfield what makes you think that it's too slow for search algos?
 schachmatt: @FdevM what language are you writing in?
 JLukeSkywalker: for most games, if you run a sim in python you can get maybe 10-100 iterations, c++ you could get thousands
 Zenoscave: 10k + usually. 100k+ depending on creativity and gamestate complexity
 Scarfield: to compete on CG with search algos, what makes you think python will work DumbassDan? i started only knowing python, but switched to c++ when i wanted to learn and use minimax etc
 Tiramon: oh now struct resubmitted
 struct: yes, it was bugged
 Zenoscave: He wasn't getting any games. wanted more
 struct: I was not getting any battles
 orangesnowfox: The real question... Is "how high of a branching factor does this game have"
 Hjax: python is definitely too slow for search algos given codingames time constraints, source: ive tried it 
 orangesnowfox: and the answer is... Quite a bit MCTS?
 Zenoscave: ~20 in mid game
 DumbassDan: My reasoning is that most of the time the performance gains simply from switching language aren't justified most of the time
 FdevM: @schachmatt python, you can start making fun of me
 Astrobytes: It's more 'how much interaction is there between players' no?
 AllYourWhat: python is the true leaderboard
 DumbassDan: You could implement your algo in a more optimal way and get very decent performance out of python
 KalamariKing: Yeah, you just gotta be smart about it
 Hjax: DumbassDan tell that to my othello program, which saw a massive improvement from switching from java to rust, and java is already much faster than python 
 ddreams: usually some legend players with python
 inoryy: DumbassDan you're thinking in real-world terms, in time / resource constrained environments it's a bit of a different story
 Zenoscave: operative word is *some
 SabertheLost: what happen to struct?
 Astrobytes: Game-subjective ddreams
 Hjax: struct resubmitted
 dreadylein: @dumbassDan no, dont get me wrong, you can squeez out perfomance for basicly any language, but it realy depends on what you are aiming for, top spots in a search heavy game&#160;? very unlikely
 KalamariKing: stru​ct died
 DumbassDan: I'm talking about cpu/memory bound applications, usually all it takes is a little profiling for large&#160;% perfomance gains
 Lizerino: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/swlh/python-can-be-faster-than-c-2372c627068">https://medium.com/swlh/python-can-be-faster-than-c-2372c627068</a>
 Astrobytes: inoryy: *real world = research world&#160;:)
 schachmatt: @FdevM we were all there once! Are you struggling more with implementing your solutions in code or thinking of solutions to the problems in the first place?
 Zenoscave: i bet that link uses a library
 Hjax: DumbassDan spending hours optimizing a search in python and youll still be 50x slower than somewhat sloppy C++ or Rust
 andrefpoliveira: It depends
 Hjax: theres a reason theres not a single python3 submission in legend in ultimate tic tac toe for instance 
 particleflux: that article draws rash conclusions :D
 DumbassDan: I could be wrong, but I doubt that
 Hjax: DumbassDan ive literally done it
 andrefpoliveira: Last contest I changed from python to c++ and I got less states ahahahah
 JLukeSkywalker: why poke and prod python to get a 10-20% performance gain when you could switch to c++ and get a 200% gain
 inoryy: Astrobytes not even that, for most real-world cases the perf gains aren't *that* necessary, esp since most heavy stuff will run in C anyway
 schachmatt: @Zenoscave it literally translates python into machine code :laughing:
 Lizerino: i dont know.. the article says python can be faster than c++ under certain conditions and it aint wrong
 ashikujjaman: why game ends before day 5
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: yeah, numba, and it's conclusions and methods are questionable at best
 Zenoscave: Rediculous
 DumbassDan: I guess I just like learning the gritty internals of the language, so I don't mind poking and prodding it :D
 KalamariKing: Question: java or javascript
 JLukeSkywalker: its not worth it though
 dreadylein: noone minds this, many people like exactly this&#160;;) 
 DumbassDan: And it really doesn't take long with built in profilers
 inoryy: DumbassDan you're assuming people telling you it's not possible haven't also done that...
 fvla: I only started using C++ because my mind couldn't handle Python's loosely typed structures
 KalamariKing: java it is thanks
 fvla: I'm glad it was the right choice for performance
 JLukeSkywalker: if your python needs to be optimized enough that you need to profile it and mess around, you are using the wrong language
 Scarfield: ^
 FdevM: @schachmatt yes, that's why i still stuck in medium puzzles quest
 Lizerino: luke.. couldnt that argument be said for every language
 dreadylein: nah, thats totaly fine, if it is about squezing everything out of language
 DumbassDan: I mean, I'm sure most people profile their code at least somewhat for top rankings on CG leaderboards
 Astrobytes: inoryy: I find it odd that in a world where efficiency is the order of the day that this would be the case. Surely more efficiency would mean less resource usage overall (environmentally speaking) 
 Innocent9902: Nowadays performance is not a critical aspect since most CPU's are getting fast and fast
 Lizerino: like if your c++ needs to be optimized to not have memory leaks you are using the wrong language
 Scarfield: use the right tool basicly&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Innocent9902: Yes, it's called being wasteful.
 ashikujjaman: why game ends before day 5?
 fvla: Lizerino i think that if you're writing c++ code that needs to be optimized to not have memory leaks you are writing the wrong code
 Nerchio: honestly if everyone used C++ here i don't think the site would be as popular as it is :P
 inoryy: Astrobytes outside of research the most common use case for python would be web dev I guess? there you have like 10 layers of caches to deal with the inefficiencies of python
 Scarfield: DontWasteBytes
 Zenoscave: ashikujjaman you error out if it does
 Zenoscave: Naw a lot of web dev switched to node.
 particleflux: yuck node
 Lizerino: fvla but then you can say the same thing.. if you are writing python that needs to be optimized for speed your writing the wrong code
 particleflux: now that is an issue with performance, not py
 Zenoscave: I write most in TS
 particleflux: :P
 Astrobytes: inoryy: I guess I speak of research a lot :D
 avdg: TS here too
 Innocent9902: most people want to be productive and ease while working not a headache searching which line semicolon should be added
 JLukeSkywalker: if you need your code to run quickly, you dont pick the slowest language
 AllYourWhat: wait you guys don't write everything in Fortran?
 DumbassDan: Didn't mean to start a language war, sorry. Only meant to say being smart about your algo is more likely to get you leaderboard places than just switching languages
 Lizerino: you are not arguing for the language with those arguments you are arguing against a coder
 Scarfield: xD
 DumbassDan: Hopefully that's not too controversial
 avdg: not in lisp, no
 fvla: Lizerino that's a constraint of the language/interpreter itself. C++ can be written in ways to avoid memory leaks
 inoryy: DumbassDan it's not controversial, it's just naive
 particleflux: indeed, algo is way more important than language in these cases
 Lizerino: and python to be fast
 Zenoscave: DumbassDan too late. Flame war begun
 Hjax: DumbassDan but if you are already being smart about your algo, the lowest hanging fruit is to use a better tool for the job
 inoryy: but every python dev has gone through that phase here so no worries
 particleflux: though in day to day stuff, it won't matter in most cases
 AllYourWhat: yeah just use HTML guys
 AllYourWhat: HTML is super fast
 XeroOl: don't worry, I already am
 schachmatt: FdevM have you checked out the activities-&gt;learn page on codingame
 avdg: I guess css is turing complete by now?
 fvla: AllYourWhat HTML is still slower than C++
 AllYourWhat: lol! true avdg
 XeroOl: I'm at rank 190 in bronze with my HTML bot
 schachmatt: geeksforgeeks also has some great articles on algorithms
 Astrobytes: A wild avdg appears
 Zenoscave: Can we stop making the stupid joke about css being turing complete
 fvla: whoa, is CSS actually turing complete?
 fvla: oh lmao
 AllYourWhat: i thought it actually was?
 particleflux: is it?
 Zenoscave: it is. but being turing complete is meaningless
 Astrobytes: Yes. But
 Astrobytes: .
 schachmatt: C++ this, Rust that... all pale in comparison to Haskell
 Innocent9902: NASA in danger
 Astrobytes: I feel like this conversation has been had before Zenoscave
 FdevM: @schachmatt i read almost all posts of python in this section
 inoryy: Astrobytes in research python inefficiency often almost doesn't matter since it's basically a DSL for a compiled workload
 Zenoscave: A slide rule is turing complete. doesn't mean any one uses one 
 Zenoscave: Yesterday Astrobytes, Yesterday.
 davilla: a slide rule&#160;??
 inoryy: Astrobytes but there are teams working on making it faster, see e.g. Instagram's fork of CPython
 Astrobytes: inoryy: yes, I can understand that
 Westicles: Alan to his young male students:  you make me Turing complete
 avdg: yeah, there is no option to compete with css yet :neutral_face:not that I want to try though...
 fvla: Is there anything to gain from learning functional languages (Haskell/Lisp) for bot competitions?
 Astrobytes: And I didn't see that actually inoryy
 avdg: you can always try to learn a language you understand half
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 avdg: and see what you get out of it
 Hjax: if this site supported pypy, python would at least be a little competitive 
 fvla: CSS doesn't have proper i/o so it will never be added&#160;:(
 ddreams: yeah, it's a great way to get some experience with a language
 Hjax: pypy wont get you C++ performance 
 Hjax: but it really does help a lot 
 fvla: I heard that pypy can be slower in some ways
 inoryy: Astrobytes there's also something interesting coming out from Microsoft but I probably can't share more than that&#160;:)
 fvla: Would be nice if we had the *choice*
 AllYourWhat: so you're saying we should have an HTML/css combined choice?
 Zenoscave: GPT3 api inoryy?
 Zenoscave: :D
 XeroOl: can you only plant trees along an axis from your existing plants?
 Hjax: my experience is that pypy is ~7x faster for the kind of workloads you do on codingame
 inoryy: Zenoscave no, Python performance related
 Scarfield: distance away from their size XeroOl
 Zenoscave: oooh sweet
 fvla: Ah, it's that significant, huh
 Lizerino: is there like a tech support for codingame.. ive checked it a million times.. no output before input and no extra inputs after the ones that came with the template 
 avdg: gpt3 bot would be fun, I hope it's fast enough though
 jacek: so pypypypy would be 49x faster?
 XeroOl: is that distance measured taxicab, or only along a straight line Scarfield
 Hjax: jacek now youre thinking with portals 
 Scarfield: dont know what taxicab is, but touching cells away i guess you can say
 davilla: can't find any info online about the Turing completeness of a slide rule
 Scarfield: "hex manhattan"
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: taxicab is Manhattan
 fvla: btw I heard that Rust is supposed to be good for avoiding memory leaks
 XeroOl: like can a tree at index 0 plant at index 8
 fvla: if that's the case...
 XeroOl: if it's tall enough?
 fvla: ...then what the hell happened to Firefox?
 Scarfield: AstroCabs
 particleflux: "avoiding memory leaks" - well pay attention is good for that, too :D
 ddreams: Lizerino, are you certain you don't stop reading until it's done?
 ashikujjaman: I am taking all input first then printing command but it stil showing thisWarning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 fvla: particleflux i agree&#160;:)
 XeroOl: you must be reading something in wrong if you're getting that
 schachmatt: @FdevM try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/</a>
 Astrobytes: inoryy: Interesting! I look forward to 'forthcoming developments'&#160;;)
 Enknable: or you didnt include an endline ashikujjaman
 davilla: Microsoft? Not holding my breath
 inoryy: that's a very dated perception ^
 Astrobytes: Enknable :wave:
 davilla: are they going to redefine python to calculate modulus wrong for negative numbers?
 Astrobytes: +1 inoryy
 geio: what is the rank of boss in bronze now
 geio: i can't see it
 aCat: no boss
 Hjax: theres no bronze boss
 inoryy: Astrobytes all I can say is watch out for proceeds of "Making CPython faster" talk by Guido at the PyCon summit <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://us.pycon.org/2021/summits/language/">https://us.pycon.org/2021/summits/language/</a>
 Hjax: until monday 
 aCat: silver league will be opened later
 geio: :o
 Enknable: Astrobytes Hey! 
 geio: ok
 Astrobytes: Noted inoryy, thanks&#160;:)
 struct: i lost again
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jacek: delete
 Wontonimo: yup, only solution
 Enknable: struct you have some secret Yavaleth snippets laying around?
 struct: no
 Hjax: struct is this the stronger unsubmitted bot, or the one from the testing?
 struct: I justed coded 2k lines in 1 hour
 Tiramon: we had a tie struct&#160;;)
 schachmatt: @inoryy can anyone watch that conference?
 struct: This is from testing
 Hjax: so the stronger bot is waiting?
 inoryy: schachmatt unfortunately no, but there will be proceedings posted, e.g. talk summary
 struct: no Hjax
 fvla: is there any way for me to reach bronze faster? lol
 struct: I think this is my strongest one
 Hjax: ah
 orangesnowfox: fvla: faster than what?
 struct: I will code more after, but not today
 Westicles: 197 people above wood1 boss.  kind of weird
 fvla: i'm just joking about the absurd number of battles and low speed
 Astrobytes: I'm not coding anything until tomorrow
 fvla: i'm one of those 197
 fvla: 52%...
 fvla: please end my suffering
 Atatakakatta: servers must be slammed
 orangesnowfox: I'm currently working, just waiting for a client to respond...
 jacek: ahh those csb players...
 Scarfield: MissingNo!
 XeroOl: if you're above the boss in wood1, you just have to stop testing in arena
 orangesnowfox: jacek!
 XeroOl: and just wait for it to finish
 fvla: stop testing in arena?
 schachmatt: @inoryy cool! Never heard of pycon before but looking at the schedule looks really interesting 
 Atatakakatta: yeah, if you're above the boss, just be patient, you'll get promoted
 fvla: i was mostly joking, didn't think there was any real way to speed up this process
 cguzman: Bronze!
 orangesnowfox: :c you outrank me jacek, I had like 30 minutes of coding before I started work
 MACKEYTH: Gratz!
 inoryy: schachmatt yeah I don't really get that policy but there's basically only about 100 people allowed to see the talk live 
 jacek: orangesnowfox lol i just take the second possible move
 orangesnowfox: lol
 orangesnowfox: I don't do `grow`
 orangesnowfox: err, no, I do grow, I don't do `seed`
 Atatakakatta: my code is basically "get points as fast as possible"
 Atatakakatta: and it's working pretty well so far
 orangesnowfox: That's a reasonable strat
 Enknable: try:
 Atatakakatta: just seeing my first loss to a good patient strategy
 Atatakakatta: not even getting into this shade stuff -_-
 orangesnowfox: You will at some point
 inoryy: I'm trying "if lose: stop_lose()" doesn't work as well
 davilla: reason for the policy is obvious: difficult to be critical of a talk if you can't watch it
 DomiKo: try print('you lost')
 orangesnowfox: I'm debating if I want to venture out to sims this compo
 avdg: print('I tried some coding')
 Atatakakatta: cout &lt;&lt; "200 points"
 orangesnowfox: panic!("wtheck just happened")
 fvla: *cout without std::*
 schachmatt: @inoryy seems needlessly exclusive :laughing:
 Atatakakatta: who needs anything but std?
 particleflux: "they used algorithms and coding to ensure drones didn't crash into each other"
 orangesnowfox: lol
 particleflux: that's all you need
 particleflux: :D
 orangesnowfox: except, it's coding and algorithms :p
 Atatakakatta: if(crash)don't;
 particleflux: damn :D
 fvla: i don't want to see any of those cursed #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt; at least
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kproPsch7i0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kproPsch7i0</a>
 inoryy: schachmatt yeah... they're promising detailed proceeds though so I guess we'll see
 Tiramon: yay rank 2 again
 Nerchio: gz
 schachmatt: well that's something
 Atatakakatta: my code is desperately trying to hang on to top 50
 Atatakakatta: considering how basic it is I'm happy with that!
 fvla: ~~just use bitboards~~
 ftpud: 4th :crying_cat_face:
 TobiasA: how can i get the input from the site to an external ide so i can print stuff
 struct: ftpud you can ignore my rank
 aCat: TobiasA you have to reprint it on your debug stream
 struct: I tested the game
 TobiasA: where is the debug stream?
 MACKEYTH: Is there a boss in Bronze? Other than struct?
 JLukeSkywalker: not till monday
 struct: im not a boss
 orangesnowfox: you're *a* boss, not *the* boss
 WesCraterMadman: not with that attitude you're not
 TobiasA: woooaaah struct you are here i am a big fan
 aCat: you print on stderr depends on your language, you should have hint in the default code
 TobiasA: hehe
 orangesnowfox: struct, is there a reference anywhere to the range of seeds? the statement doesn't seem to have one
 fvla: As someone who's done other bot competitions before, I've gotta say that I'm really thankful for the ability to continuously test vs opponents here
 TobiasA: where can i find the debug stream
 fvla: standard error
 Atatakakatta: @orangesnowfox range equals size of tree
 struct: orangesnowfox what do you mean?
 Atatakakatta: it's in the statement somewhere
 fvla: std::cerr in c++
 struct: a size 1 tree can seed 1 distance, 2 distance 2, and 3 can seed distance 3
 orangesnowfox: struct, what Atatakakatta said, except I still have no clue where it is lol
 orangesnowfox: got it
 fvla: I just want to access the bronze statement...
 particleflux: can't motivate myself to write a custom bot today, the given boilerplate was with a few minimal modifications enough until bronze
 fvla: but I'm at 74%...
 Atatakakatta: go take a walk
 Atatakakatta: eat some lunch or dinner or whatever
 fvla: already ate lunch
 orangesnowfox: Go take a walk
 fvla: recently
 Atatakakatta: @orangesnowfox it's under "Actions"
 Brunin: eat again
 Atatakakatta: SEED: Command a tree to eject a seed onto a cell within distance equal to the tree's size. 
 JP7: is it against the rules to share the statements of each tier?
 orangesnowfox: Ah, I see it now, not sure how I didn't before now, since I've read the line
 JP7: can I just pastebin it to ya?
 Hjax: its not against the rules 
 orangesnowfox: JP7, I don't see why it would be, there's literally the source code of the bot available, but I also have bronze, so if you're trying to send it to me :p
 orangesnowfox: s/bot/game
 fvla: s/bot/game?
 JP7: @fvla <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gist.github.com/John-Paul-R/0c4075e450ac0540ae38ade366ebe54b">https://gist.github.com/John-Paul-R/0c4075e450ac0540ae38ade366ebe54b</a>
 fvla: thanks!
 JP7: gotchu
 orangesnowfox: fvla: it's a regex expression, read it as "replace bot with game" (once)
 fvla: okay, that's what it looked like
 Lizerino: just to make sure i wasnt printing anything out of turn i put all commands into a list and printed them at the end and i still get a u did not read all input error
 fvla: ohhhh i see now what that means lol
 Hjax: Lizerino you only print once per input, if you print twice, youll get that error 
 fvla: but it should bes/game$/game\//
 Hjax: so you get the input, print exactly one command, get the input again, etc
 orangesnowfox: fvla, wat
 fvla: it's a convoluted way of saying "you missed the slash at the end"
 Lizerino: that would explain it.. thank you hjax
 fvla: 83% whoo
 KCrown: what happens when both issue a valid grow 1 command?
 orangesnowfox: fvla: that one only matters if you're adding flags&#160;;)
 fvla: btw do the rules change beyond bronze?
 orangesnowfox: nope
 Atatakakatta: beyond bronze doesn't exist yet
 Hjax: the rules will not change beyond bronze though
 orangesnowfox: But still, the rules won't change
 Atatakakatta: @Kcrown both can grow at the same time
 fvla: orangesnowfox is it valid sed syntax though? i know it's not valid perl
 orangesnowfox: It's a holdover from IRC, I have no clue
 KCrown: but each spot can only have one tree 
 Atatakakatta: if you're asking whether both can seed at the same time, if both players try to seed the same hex, neither does anything, I just saw it happen
 JP7: @fvla Here is the bronze league info with the images <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.jpcode.dev/temp/cg_spring_2021_bronze_info.html">https://static.jpcode.dev/temp/cg_spring_2021_bronze_info.html</a>
 JP7: picture worth a thousand words
 particleflux: ah, IRC, good old times
 JP7: "If both players send a seed to the same place on the same turn, neither seed is planted and the sun points are refunded. The source tree, however, still becomes dormant."
 orangesnowfox: KCrown, with seed: Neither does anything, and the sun gets refunded, *but* the trees are still marked as dormant
 orangesnowfox: what JP7 said
 avdg: hmmm... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/6EsPpkPc">https://pastebin.com/6EsPpkPc</a>
 fvla: JP7 thank you so much (although i'm now at 87%)
 JP7: I am copypaste master
 JP7: xd
 avdg: I can't trust Math.min
 KCrown: ok thanks
 orangesnowfox: avdg, no, that makes sense
 Westicles: Do they ever make unplanned rule changes?  Like making the grid bigger?
 Astrobytes: Not like that no.
 Atatakakatta: if you think wood 1 is slow, wait until you see how long the battles take in Bronze
 wasMalnourished: Hi guys
 orangesnowfox: I'm still in the top 1k of bronze despite literally 2 submissions lol
 orangesnowfox: and the second one was to add grow
 avdg: hmm I missed something
 ddreams: they used to change the rules for every league, but I think they never do that anymore
 Hoyer: are Sun points given out before or after the actions?
 WesCraterMadman: I've been chilling in bronze for like 20 min and I'm only 40% done
 orangesnowfox: Hoyer, they're given at the start of every round
 wasMalnourished: I m new to codingame&#160;:)) hope to have a great time here improving my coding skills
 Hoyer: orangesnowfox  thanks 
 JP7: Welcome @wasMalnourished, hope you enjoy your stay&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: that's all I did orangesnowfox, in fact I just sorted the moves as such 
 avdg: ow right, the bounds...
 avdg: programming 101
 Astrobytes: lol avdg
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, yeah, except I didn't sort the moves lol
 orangesnowfox: I generate them (always and forever :v)
 Astrobytes: Hey, I was busy and I had 5 minutes&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: yeah, same though
 orangesnowfox: I'm still waiting for that client to respond
 avdg: though glad I can spread UIntArrays and IntArrays&#160;:-)
 orangesnowfox: ... Maybe I should work on my code quality while I wait
 fvla: Finally free!
 Astrobytes: I haven't done a thing since my second submit and do not intend to until tomorrow
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, reason?
 wasMalnourished: any newbie here?
 inoryy: christ there's already 1400 ppl in bronze
 orangesnowfox: yee
 Astrobytes: Better server speed, time to think, clearer head&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: ah, see, that's why I'll only work on factoring until then :p 
 Astrobytes: @orangesnowfox
 Astrobytes: Yes. Wise move
 orangesnowfox: People just generally either hate it or don't have time to do it lol
 Astrobytes: I already have my usual skeleton code ready to go
 orangesnowfox: for a ga? or what?
 orangesnowfox: oh, wait, duh, the same "skeleton" I normally make, but tailored to you
 Astrobytes: Most searches, pathfinding, etc
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Atatakakatta: who needs that? just brute force it!
 icecream17: how many turns are in a day?
 Astrobytes: I delete as appropriate on contest release
 orangesnowfox: icecream17: n
 Atatakakatta: @icecream17 until you both rest
 orangesnowfox: In practice, probably less than 10
 Westicles: Are books going to come into play on this one?
 orangesnowfox: books?
 Westicles: opening, closing whatever
 Astrobytes: There's not much depth to it. I think it will be a how fast is your search and how deep can you go kinda thing
 Nerchio: i say no but i know nothing about opening books :sunglasses:
 DomiKo: Westicles yes yes
 DomiKo: many people will hardcode first few moves
 Marchete: it seems
 Nerchio: theres random starting positions though idk how many
 Astrobytes: check the ref
 Marchete: with symmetry, not that many
 fvla: not only random starting positions but also random unplantable areas?
 fvla: how do you write books for that?
 Marchete: ahh unplantable, true
 Marchete: then it's harder
 Mourfette: question, are the actions done in parallele? like if I have a size 2 tree un X, can i send "GROW X | COMPLETE X&#160;?
 Tiramon: just do one action per loop
 Tiramon: as long as you don't wait it will happen on the same day
 MACKEYTH: You get unlimited turns per day, but only 1 action per turn
 Mourfette: oh I see ok
 fvla: " If both players send a seed to the same place on the same turn, neither seed is planted and the sun points are refunded. The source tree, however, still becomes dormant."Does this imply the possibility of deadlocks?
 orangesnowfox: wym deadlocks?
 fvla: oh wait dormancy
 fvla: crap
 fvla: ignore me
 orangesnowfox: nwnw
 fvla: spec went from 0 to 60 from wood 1 to bronze
 Astrobytes: I thought that said dreadlocks... been a long day&#160;:(
 Smelty: lmao just got promoted in contest with a random ai
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes... is there going to be anything weird about minimax for this game?
 orangesnowfox: Like the fact that player moves are at the same time, but also not
 yuusanlondon: lol I've been testing tons of attempts against struct's bot with different parameters and I'm yet to land a single win
 Astrobytes: Minimal player interaction
 Astrobytes: @orangesnowfox
 yuusanlondon: what is this dark magic
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes: There's also like, shadows though
 Nerchio: yuusanlondon struct was a tester so his bot is older&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Yes, but it doesn't seem to extend much more than that orangesnowfox
 Tiramon: damn there is more competition now in the top5&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I could be wrong orangesnow
 dbf: "Then, players take actions by spending their sun points." - so I can send multiple commands for step? How to split them?
 Astrobytes: fox
 Smelty: hmm
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, true
 yuusanlondon: This is getting exciting :wink:
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox: But minimax was my first thought
 Capim: tecnically each iteration of the main loop is a player's turn, not a "day"
 Hoyer: dbf 1 action per turn, multiple actions per day
 Capim: so you should only provide 1 action
 Astrobytes: hi dbf
 struct: yuusanlondon you won one time&#160;:)
 Smelty: hm
 dbf: hi Astrobytes
 Hoyer: orangesnowfox "Like the fact that player moves are at the same time, but also not" what do you mean by "also not"? they're simultaneous aren't they?
 orangesnowfox: Well, they're simultaneous, but it's still a turn based game
 orangesnowfox: Which means that like, it's impossible for them to do 2 moves before you do one (which happens in RTA games)
 marksalisbury: The comments at the top say of the provided input parsing code say "the game lasts 24 days: 0-23", however, it's logical for each day to mean all 6 positions of the sun, so there should really be 4 days and 24 turns, right?
 marksalisbury: (I wonder if the comment is wrong)
 cegprakash: Astrobytes hey
 cegprakash: I reached bronze and possible top 100
 cegprakash: without reading problem statement
 Astrobytes: Hey cegprakash
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://www.twitch.tv/cegprakash</a> 
 orangesnowfox: marksalisbury, a day is every *rotation*, not every full loop, think about it as a year being 6 days
 yuusanlondon: struct oh wow! I had literally tried like 30 games against your bot- time to study how the win happened!
 Astrobytes: I know you got bronze I was in there :D
 orangesnowfox: The sun goes in a circle over 6 days
 Astrobytes: AstrocyteDnB is my twitch cegprakash
 marksalisbury: thanks orangesnowfox
 Smelty: yass
 fvla: i wonder if the sun precesses
 fvla: oh well
 fvla: trees growing in 3 days is pretty insane to begin with
 fvla: let's not think too hard about the physics behind days here
 WesCraterMadman: this game takes place on a planet circling its sun at an absurd rate
 Astrobytes: So are pawns and whatnot being chased by castles.
 Smelty: ikr
 WesCraterMadman: the fauna has evolved to grow quickly to take advantage of the sun
 schachmatt: don't be silly the sun circles the planet
 fvla: most importantly, we have creatures that are called Tororo and Ghilbib
 Astrobytes: That did amuse me
 fvla: This planet clearly exists just to make fun of ours
 WesCraterMadman: I laughed at the bot names
 fvla: ikr
 Smelty: hmm yes
 Astrobytes: Ghilbib was my favourite I must say
 SwagColoredKitteh: the sun circles this planet as if the planet is flat and the sun is going in circles above it
 SwagColoredKitteh: flat earth confirmed
 steph.paso: flat earth &gt;&gt;
 PythonSlayer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/xueliam">https://www.twitch.tv/xueliam</a> pls he is missing 3 follows&#160;:)
 Vadasz: Hi! Submits are very slow. Are there same known problems, or this speed is normal?
 Tiramon: missing the giant turtle and elephants for that
 WesCraterMadman: Nah if it were a flat earth the center would be a big cold mountain where the gods lived
 SwagColoredKitteh: t h e g o d s
 Spacer: What does "Once you have proven yourself against the first Boss" mean?
 Queuebee: big spaghetti &amp; balls
 SwagColoredKitteh: maybe we are on this mountain and the gods are the gods of agriculture
 WesCraterMadman: outrank it in the arena
 Tiramon: get a stable rank better than the boss Spacer
 Astrobytes: It's turtles all the way down
 raxkin: Does anyone have a problem with the game preview? it shows a gray screen instead of the game
 raxkin: And a error on console:
 raxkin: Cannot read property 'resize' of undefined
 Smelty: nope.....but try reloading first
 ddreams: many people had that problem
 Smelty: hmm
 raxkin: It worked fine on my other linux pc, i'm on windows now and not working. wierd
 ddreams: many reported restarting the browser fixed it
 Smelty: weird-
 Smelty: well im on linux
 KiwiTae: im on linux too works on chronium
 Astrobytes: The gray screen will be fixed when CG complete their PIXI.js lib upgrade
 Astrobytes: Should be tomorrow-ish
 Smelty: ah okay
 CasualPotato: raxkin check if your hardware accelaration is turned on in chrome, this fixed it for me
 AntiSquid: looking at this game and wondering if it's more productive to go to the pub instead
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and if it is, disable, exit, then reopen and enable. Works for some.
 Nerchio: lol :D
 KiwiTae: AntiSquid to the pub
 raxkin: CasualPotato that worked! i had it disabled for other stuff. Turning it on works
 Astrobytes: I have tonight. I've been watching everything unfold and drinking beer
 Eglerion: Pub sounds amazing. Sadly everything is closed here in germany. #thankscovid 
 SwagColoredKitteh: come to the rust side, we have lots of pub
 Astrobytes: lol
 xMizar: Does anyone have that problem? "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 SwagColoredKitteh: i hate covid it's time we rm it
 xMizar: My actions are desynchronized but i can't understand why
 schachmatt: @Eglerion just wait a week, you never know with the rolling lockdown
 SwagColoredKitteh: vaccinate me already, belgium
 MrWhoG: how do i get to the next league?
 KiwiTae: struct you gonna make it till tomorrow it seems
 fvla: xMizar You must have either added a read or removed one
 Nerchio: xMizar you either read too much, output too much or your code timeouts
 fvla: hm, so those are also possible. interesting
 AntiSquid: SwagColoredKitteh are you sure you need it? if you're negative and have antibodies it's pointless imo
 Smelty: hmm yes.
 Astrobytes: s/covid/peasandlove
 Smelty: hmm
 Smelty: st
 WesCraterMadman: I love the bots that just wait for their trees to grow up, chop them down, and take a nap for the rest of the game
 Smelty: xD
 Westicles: So many people are having side effects, now people who don't are worried something went wrong
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: fake rumors tho
 Smelty: some of them
 Rabeeb: since when are battles so slow
 Smelty: speed em up on the side
 Smelty: the settings
 Rabeeb: takes about 10 minutes to finish all
 fvla: i wonder if battles will speed up in a few days when everyone gets bored
 Smelty: if they arent appearing then yea its just fighting em
 Rabeeb: no i mean the system battle time
 Smelty: fvla: possibly
 Eglerion: they're slow since it's the first day of the competition... has never been any different on day 1 ^^
 fvla: i see!
 AntiSquid: you can check CDC website online they keep track of side effects i heard, no idea what it covers, some stuff listed, didn't look into it just know it's there
 Smelty: yea
 Rabeeb: ohh..
 Smelty: I make my bots say "I sleepy boi" when they finish a turn lol
 MACKEYTH: So few people give their bots flavor messages
 Astrobytes: No, it's usually for debug purposes
 cegprakash: are there any new rules after bronze??
 Astrobytes: Unless it's "mudamudamuda"
 Astrobytes: No cegprakash
 cegprakash: weird.. 
 WesCraterMadman: just scarier robots
 Astrobytes: Bronze is final
 cegprakash: I only print valid moves and I'm top 100
 MrFruit: I tweaked a little character, and my bot got destroyed by the boss
 cegprakash: I see top 2 guys replay
 cegprakash: fighting for middle of the map
 Astrobytes: Humblebrags don't work in bronze on the first day cegprakash
 inoryy: I assume most people only print valid moves
 AntiSquid: muda is opponent eval actually
 Tiramon: first time i see something like thisThe tree on cell 30 is too far from cell 9 to plant a seed there
 Tiramon: did i miss the range stuff?
 KiwiTae: cegprakash if you don't print a valid move your bot looses the game
 XeroOl: @MACKEYTH I've added flavor messages for my bot
 XeroOl: I don't know why others haven't
 XeroOl: it's kind of fun
 Asterixk: @Tiramon how about tree size?
 cegprakash: @XeroOl you should trash talk to distract opponent
 cegprakash: especially when opponent is in the lead
 Tiramon: is that a question or do you have something in the rules?
 ddreams: you can plant up to tree-size away from the tree
 Asterixk: range depends on src tree size
 Spacer: Now I get it! It's not that I don't win, it's just that battles are super slow. And here I am resubmitting it over and over.
 Tiramon: oh there it is ... 
 Astrobytes: Tiramon:SEED: Command a tree to eject a seed onto a cell within distance equal to the tree's size.
 fvla: Distance is in the doc
 Astrobytes: Ah you got it&#160;:)
 fvla: "The distance between two cells equals the minimum number of cells to go through to get from one to the other."
 struct: my bot is starting to lose more
 Tiramon: ok ... no i have to rethink my stuff for this .. still wondering that it was working so good without watching for this&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: struct: this is your final testing bot?
 ddreams: well, when you do it you wait instead
 struct: yes
 ddreams: waiting isn't that bad
 MACKEYTH: Jeepers Tiramon, you got into the top 10 with a bot that could throw invalid commands? Metal.
 Tiramon: it's is really bad if i skip a whole day that way
 Tiramon: was rank 2 with it most of the evning and close to struct&#160;;)
 ddreams: proving my point
 ddreams: but you won't get to legend that way :p
 Tiramon: hope that bugfix does not decrease the performance&#160;;)
 MACKEYTH: It's a load-bearing bug
 AntiSquid: MACKEYTH still start of contest, everyone has a bugs 
 struct: Even I have bugs
 AntiSquid: your bug opened silver early
 Tiramon: ok so i also have to calc distances now ... was so fun without ...
 struct: if any bot has higher win rate than 99% then open silver
 orangesnowfox: Why do they have 37 cells :cI wish it was &lt;= 31 so that I could do 4 bits per cell index 
 struct: I have mixed feelings about having submited this bot
 fvla: Is there a way to watch top replays?
 Asterixk: too soon struct?
 ddreams: go to the full leaderboard
 orangesnowfox: fvla: are you a top player? :p
 fvla: nope
 fvla: :P
 AntiSquid: orangesnowfox no idea, but i counted max number of shadows you can cast on cell with a tree is 3 * 6 directions * 37 = 666
 DomiKo: struct you spoiled a bit I guess
 struct: spoiled?
 orangesnowfox: Did struct spoil anything?
 Tiramon: fvla you can here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard</a>
 Astrobytes: That would have been far too easy orangesnowfox (the fitting the board in a 32 bit uint that is)
 fvla: thanks!
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, I just want to fit the neighbors into an integer... Oh, neighbors fit into a 32 bit int with only 2 wasted
 Astrobytes:  I don't think struct spoiled anything with his bot 
 Tiramon: i didn't even analyzed his bot yet =)
 AntiSquid: i don't think everyone wants to do bitsets and beamsearch though
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes: I didn't even think about that! aaaaggggh
 Tiramon: he is just the motivation to get better
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox: :P
 struct: Also i dont think the meta will be this
 AntiSquid: use 64 uint
 struct: My bot was only trained against version of itself
 orangesnowfox: oh right, struct, you're using nn?
 struct: no
 orangesnowfox: derp
 struct: By training I mean improved eval
 orangesnowfox: lol
 orangesnowfox: :c I fell out of the top 1k finally
 Astrobytes: His bot was total BS :D
 inoryy: human gradient descent
 orangesnowfox: hahaha... Imagine tuning millions of dials
 AntiSquid: submit spam gradient
 MrWhoG: how to i get to the next league?
 orangesnowfox: MrWhoG: get gud and then wait
 struct: Im not even sure if this bot can make it to gold
 Astrobytes: Human Gradient Descent - like getting down from Everest right?
 struct: Also I asked cg before I submited
 MrWhoG: so press "test in arena" and then just wait?
 struct: But I dont think they were aware of this version
 AntiSquid: why ask CG, what's the issue struct? lol
 orangesnowfox: MrWhoG, yeah, basically, if it's not good enough, do it better
 struct: My other version has 1% winrate vs this one
 Astrobytes: Doesn't matter struct
 MrWhoG: im winning like 99% of the time
 AeroFufel: @struct Does Struct has a stream? or anything casing?
 Marchete: calm down struct
 orangesnowfox: MrWhoG, what version?
 AntiSquid: what's the commotion all about? i don't get it lol
 Astrobytes: It's a good benchmark
 struct: sorry
 MrWhoG: what do you mean? which version?
 Tiramon: that will change MrWhoG&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: struct is doubting himself, don't struct, it's all cool
 AntiSquid: struct did nothing wong
 orangesnowfox: yee, struct, you're fiine
 Astrobytes: Ey enough pings
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/struct">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/struct</a>
 struct: I dont ear pings its fine
 inoryy: struct struct struct
 MrWhoG: so if i press "test in arena" i see like 15 games that i almost all won, then sometimes new battles come in. do i have to wait until the list has 100 battles or what?
 Astrobytes: lol
 dreadylein: @inoryy :D 
 dbf: MrWhoG yes
 Astrobytes: MrWhoG: that's your submission progressing
 Nerchio: MrWhoG depends on your goal, if you want to advance to higher league then wait
 AntiSquid: i am currently thinkering my structs
 Tiramon: MrWhoG battles are slow right now ... many people are submiting
 MrWhoG: so if i change anything about my code the progress resets?
 Tiramon: just keep thinking how to improve your bot while he finds his rank in the world&#160;;)
 fvla: Maybe I need to make a neural network for this competition
 Astrobytes: No, not unless you resubmit
 Smelty: perhapsnt
 Astrobytes: Or maybe just connect your own one in the right ways fvla
 MrWhoG: ok, but i don't have to stay on the battle list view, right? it just does it's thing in the background
 Astrobytes: yes
 Smelty: breh its been 20 mins and only half of hte battle for me have been fought
 MrWhoG: thanks guys! &lt;3
 fvla: but fr I'm thinking about training one later on
 fvla: for now it's just good ol' algos
 Astrobytes: Feel free.
 inoryy: i'm training one as we speak
 Astrobytes: Smelty: such is the way of the contest
 struct: is NN even feasible?
 inoryy: a human one, sure
 Smelty: yes astro
 struct: I dont have any knowledge on NNs thats why iam asking
 Astrobytes: You do
 Astrobytes: Your own
 fvla: Isn't NN just a bunch of matrix multiplications to execute?
 WesCraterMadman: where would you train it?
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: nsa has nothing on us
 inoryy: fvla a bit of a simplification, but sure
 Coded_Ragon: Helloworld!
 ProgrammingIsLove: Hey
 Westicles: EU has new ban on AI.  Sorry, no NN for you guys
 fvla: i know it's slightly more complex because of activation functions and other layers but ye
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: howdy
 ddreams: all the bots are basically just cpu instructions to execute
 Coded_Ragon: I unlocked the chat. :D
 ProgrammingIsLove: why was it locked earlier
 AntiSquid: there are more types of ML models than the popular NN&#160;!!!
 WesCraterMadman: I've thought of trying to implement a NN on problems here, but how do you do it? You need a ton of data to train the dang thing
 Astrobytes: May the bots have mercy on our souls.
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: 15 threats approaching fast&#160;!
 XeroOl: can you guys top making bots better than mine? my rank on the leaderboard is getting worse over time
 XeroOl: thanks in advance
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: :joy:
 inoryy: AntiSquid blasphemy
 WesCraterMadman: yeah what he said
 Nerchio: WesCraterMadman you can run the game locally using referee on github
 WesCraterMadman: ooh I did not know that
 Astrobytes: And scrape replays
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: xxx on a killstreak uh
 Astrobytes: are you ill DJPrivatePony_ed4b?
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: no:no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: Your chatting makes little sense so far. Fix it.
 MACKEYTH: Is there a way to select a specific bot from the leaderboard to train against?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/struct">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/struct</a>
 DomiKo: use this and copy ID 
 XeroOl: @MACKEYTH yes
 Astrobytes: In the IDE or offline MACKEYTH?
 ddreams: yes, click "delete"
 MACKEYTH: IDE
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: who put on the planet :japanese_ogre:
 Astrobytes: Just click the opponent icon and replace it with another one from the league you are in
 AntiSquid: why is number of cells given in input if it's always 37 btw? ~_~
 Astrobytes: *the delete below the opponent icon
 Astrobytes: It may be a stub thing AntiSquid
 fvla: AntiSquid because they didn't want to make a constants file, and instead feed everything through stdin like all CodinGame problems
 MACKEYTH: Sweet
 Astrobytes: Not 100% sure but I think it might be necessary for correct stub gen in some langs
 Astrobytes: fvla: have you looked at the game source
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Or could be redundant :shrug:
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: is there any other games like this?
 Rabeeb: is it possible to build the game locally from GitHub repo?
 fvla: Astrobytes no. what i meant by no constants file is that they didn't want to give us a constants header/module for every language
 struct: yes Rabeeb
 AntiSquid: fvla why should we believe anything you say? you don't have an avatar
 Westicles: fvla is yet another westicles troll account
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: no hes my friend
 Rabeeb: @struct where is the main functuin?
 Rabeeb: *function
 Westicles: DJ just kidding.  I've been reduced to a meme
 Rabeeb: ok I'll try to pull and build
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: ah ight:kissing_heart:
 AntiSquid: how did that level 1 enter chat&#160;? @_@
 Nerchio: wait chat is unlocked with levels? haha 
 Astrobytes: ah gotcha fvla
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 kick to make sure it's not a bug
 struct: Rabeeb I dont know how to explain it well enough, usually I just open it has a intellij project and run test.java
 Automaton2000: it's hard to make it so that if i change my profile picture
 struct: or w/e is the file name
 Astrobytes: Westicles: Be proud! :rofl:

 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: anyone from the states?
 WesCraterMadman: yo
 AntiSquid: i know someone in Florida
 WesCraterMadman: we count those
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, VA
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: im in kissimmee, FL
 WesCraterMadman: CO
 Hjax: i couldnt make myself work the whole day, im home looking at the game now 
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: sweet :fist:
 Rabeeb: @struct thanks
 Astrobytes: Hjax: work was 100% better than earlier shenanigans so you're good to go
 Techno504: hi guys, i cant see the game screen in the challenge; it is just greyed out
 struct: some people fixed it by changing browser 
 Techno504: ok i'll try that thanks
 Astrobytes: Or disabling hardware acceleration, quitting, restarting, then re-enabling
 PatrickMcGinnisII: DJPrivatePony_ed4b i know lots of people in kissimmee
 Astrobytes: It's a PIXI.js issue though on CG side, lib will be updated in next day or so
 Tiramon: and yes watching for seed ranges decreases my bot performance ... i love those bug fixes ...
 Tiramon: more on this tomorrow ... gn8
 struct: gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Maybe adding a bootstrap.js won;'t confuse the jquery
 AntiSquid: malloc(): corrupted top size @_@
 Astrobytes: gn Tiramon
 MSmits: mmh why would seeds get spookied&gt;
 MSmits: they dont even give sunpoints
 AeroFufel: Guys. While I wait in the Ranking table, most people are in gray color, but some guys have a rank in a green color. Why are those green?
 Hjax: its the forest spirits that live there that give you the sunpoints smits 
 Hjax: and they get spooked
 PatrickMcGinnisII: green are gonna advance
 MSmits: i kno
 MSmits: but there are no forest spirits in seeds
 Astrobytes: For the first time ever, Smits appears in chat on first night of contest
 AeroFufel: oh, thank you
 Astrobytes: After ?disableChat
 MSmits: hey i still have it on disable on the tab where i test my code :P
 KalamariKing: oh yeah lolwelcome back smits
 KalamariKing: my code is all over the place
 Astrobytes: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits needs tips unrelated to bitboarding
 MSmits: i was just wondering about the debug mode where it says spooked on any tile with a shaded tree but also on seeds
 MSmits: its weird
 Astrobytes: What do you think of the game?
 MSmits: Its good
 KalamariKing: spooked could just mean no spirit
 KalamariKing: it's interesting, indeed
 KalamariKing: Really well put together
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think pokemon I mean NN trainers are gonna do well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm still confused, looks like u can do multiple commands... but there's no delimiter?
 Astrobytes: I'm pretty ambivalent rn, seems a bit lacking. I may be wrong.
 MSmits: KalamariKing no thats not true, because where there is no seed, it doesnt say spooked
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can u just put spaces between commands?  Am i getting that right?
 MSmits: empty cells
 MSmits: seeded cells should have the same spook status as empty cells, because both have no spirits and give no sunpoints
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1c9a1a05-907b-44a5-a329-570f41f83eef">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1c9a1a05-907b-44a5-a329-570f41f83eef</a>
 Astrobytes: @PatrickMcGinnisII
 JP7: Each iteration of the main loop is 1 turn. Each day has many turns
 KalamariKing: @PatrickMcGinnisII the delimiter is a newline
 MSmits: sometimes the scroll bar freezes, cant scroll chat
 MSmits: its been like that for a while, not related to contest, it's annoying
 Astrobytes: yes, it's very annoying MSmits and has got worse recently
 MSmits: ah o
 MSmits: k
 Astrobytes: Been reported but :shrug:
 MSmits: I thought maybe i am freaking out my computer with the 8 running meta mcts processes
 struct: nah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i literally have 20+ lines of logic and am in top 500... hmmm
 Astrobytes: Nope. It's A Thing.
 struct: I have that problem too
 MSmits: what was that earlier thing about bitboards someone said?
 MSmits: i already finished bitboarding this thing, not that hard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: once i put in the sun cost calculation I can do multiple commands, yeah
 MSmits: it's writing a search thats complicated
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u bitboarded it? rofl
 struct: I enjoyed bitboarding it, I have no real experience with it
 MSmits: yeah, to get a compact gamestate
 Astrobytes: Really? In what way? Multiple layers&#160;?
 struct: took me a bit
 Astrobytes: Or you just packed things into ints
 MSmits: multiple layers yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did u use a different mask for sun position?
 MSmits: ownership layer, dormant layer etc
 MSmits: i have stuff that has a sun mask yeah
 Astrobytes: Hm. Are you sure this provides a speedup?
 MSmits: no, it's more about saving gamestates compactly
 struct: MSmits did you left 3 bits pad minimum for shadows?
 MSmits: in case i need to
 MSmits: i dont need to, in my case struct
 avdg: hmm more than 135 are better than the bot in wood 1
 MSmits: i just loop over trees and create a shademap from them using lookups, then combine the shades
 MSmits: i got treemaps for all sizes of trees
 struct: I see
 struct: I just did shifts
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/GiantDignifiedHawkTwitchRPG-a82m6vd8Der_MSeR">https://clips.twitch.tv/GiantDignifiedHawkTwitchRPG-a82m6vd8Der_MSeR</a> 
 Astrobytes: Yeah the shade bitmaps makes sense, we spoke about that earlier
 MSmits: nah i have shade and seed arrays precalculated
 Astrobytes: lookups would be faster I imagine
 MSmits: for each cell i can lookup where it can seed and where it throws shade
 struct: seed is precalculated for me yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smart, thought of that ... but dunno how to store board linearly ...  7x7=49 bytes?
 cegprakash: @struct u are featured in the above clip
 MSmits: i just used uint64_t
 MSmits: first 37 bytes
 MSmits: bits
 MSmits: sry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: indexes are basically fixed ... so lookup tables are doable
 MSmits: yeah the map never changes in terms of neighbors and richness
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i haven't looked at ref, but i assume random symetrical 0's
 PatrickMcGinnisII: beyond the basic board
 orangesnowfox: def symetrical 
 MSmits: sometimes there are no 0's 
 MSmits: fairly often even, it seems
 MSmits: i use a fixed seed for testing that has 0's, otherwise you wont know when your bot tries to seed 0's
 Smelty: rank: exactly 3000<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/ZnQBGt.jpg">https://snipboard.io/ZnQBGt.jpg</a>
 Smelty: update:2999
 PatrickMcGinnisII: GF is here....gotta go.  tx MSmits, still dunno if faster ... me thinks need xor bitblt
 orangesnowfox: You have a point on neighbors being static, but not sure how much that helps...
 MSmits: it helps when you create lookup arrays
 MSmits: for shading and seeding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 Astrobytes: Seems the way to go
 orangesnowfox: Also, There's between (0 and 10) * 2 zeros
 MSmits: * 2&#160;??
 MSmits: there can be 20 zeroes?
 orangesnowfox: symmetric, no? 
 orangesnowfox: oh, no, 10
 MSmits: so 0 and 5
 Hjax: the middle can be 0 though, so its not necessarily a multiple of 2 
 orangesnowfox: ^
 orangesnowfox: yeah
 MSmits: with a lot of zeroes the game becomes easier to search
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/BoardGenerator.java#L47-L61">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/BoardGenerator.java#L47-L61</a> here's the relevant part of the ref
 orangesnowfox: I can't tell what the behavior is if it wants 10 holes and the center is one of them... if it'll give 11 or 9
 MSmits: maybe I'll create a testing arena at some point if i have the time
 MSmits: usually i dont
 Asterixk: center is index 0
 orangesnowfox: yes?
 Asterixk: has no symetruic
 orangesnowfox: yea, that got brought up just a min ago
 KiwiTae: there are holes?
 orangesnowfox: bronze and up, the grey squares
 Asterixk: yup, don't fall
 KiwiTae: I should read the rules
 orangesnowfox: technically they aren't holes but like... deadzones
 Astrobytes: Some holes are best avoided KiwiTae
 struct: MSmits you mean a local referee?
 Smelty: perhaps
 struct: or visual stuff?
 orangesnowfox: Who hear can read Java for me?
 MSmits: just something that can calc winrate by simulating games
 MSmits: so nothign visual
 struct: like brutal tester?
 orangesnowfox: namely just... `random.nextInt` and what its bounds are
 MSmits: yes, but i prefer using my own
 struct: ah I see
 MSmits: takes some time to write it and avoid bugs
 MSmits: but it's doable, did it for gitc
 MSmits: similar complexity i think
 orangesnowfox: 0..10 rather than 0..=11 I think for bounds
 orangesnowfox: ie, [0, 10)
 DJPrivatePony_ed4b: fuck this 
 Astrobytes: damn you too fast
 MSmits: did some mod grab him by the pony?
 struct: My cpu is not at 100% atm
 struct: i havent coded anything yet
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: is that really bannable? he said nothing else weird right&#160;?
 struct: Im sure someone already has a bot that can beat me
 orangesnowfox: Yes, definitely [0, 10), so, now you know how many deadzones there are lol
 struct: Sure he did nothing
 struct: I saw bans for less
 avdg: for breading?
 AntiSquid: all he wanted was some interaction
 MSmits: i think you mean intercourse
 Astrobytes: Lets quit the crap and just focus on getting rid of it eh
 AntiSquid: breeding not breading @_@
 avdg: breathing I guess
 avdg: can't type
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i thought you meant breeding also
 avdg: k, lets assume it was all that
 AntiSquid: havn't seen you in a while avdg
 orangesnowfox: ngl, I thought it was breading, like, breading chicken (the act of surrounding it with breadcrumbs)
 avdg: The break between contests are long :p
 AntiSquid: hm i should do more contests on other sites to fill the gap
 schachmatt: what are some good other sites with contests?
 orangesnowfox: same, I struggle to find them though
 struct: The breaks are so long that I had to beta test
 struct: Just so it lasts longer for me
 Zenoscave: You could always do multis
 avdg: hmm too many and less people show up I guess
 MSmits: if it's just about practice, then multis are fine
 Illedan: :wave:
 MSmits: just set yourself a strict time limit
 avdg: just a matter of letting economics work
 Zenoscave: Hi Illedan
 MSmits: hi
 AntiSquid: no, it's about contests
 avdg: supply demand
 icecream17: if a cell has richness of 1, does the nutrient value descrease to 0 after completing a treecycle
 MSmits: problem with contests on other sites is that they are not as convenient as CG
 Zenoscave: richness is constant i believe
 MSmits: yeah constant
 icecream17: oh its nutrient value
 AntiSquid: i take what i get, nothing is perfect
 icecream17: i misread it oops
 orangesnowfox: richness is constant or zeroed
 MSmits: btw, is it true you can grow a tree multiple times a day and also complete it?
 AntiSquid: we get lag and IDE reset here so :P
 MSmits: so you start the day with a seed from the previous day, you grow it 3 times and complete, before the end of the day
 orangesnowfox: MSmits, how would you do that? It goes dormant after the first interaction
 Zenoscave: you can grow multiple different trees
 orangesnowfox: ^
 struct: no MSmits
 Zenoscave: dormancy means one action per tree per day
 MSmits: does it grow dormant with growth?
 orangesnowfox: ye
 struct: grow makes it dormant
 MSmits: hmm  i missed that
 Zenoscave: any ation on any tree (a seed is a tree too)
 MSmits: i thought just seeding did
 avdg: 1 touch a tree, a day
 avdg: max
 AntiSquid: treehugging
 Zenoscave: struct I think I've got most your meta figured
 MSmits: where does it say growth makes it dormant?
 Zenoscave: how to counter. No idea
 Hjax: Any tree impacted by one of your actions becomes dormant for the rest of the day. A dormant tree cannot be the subject of an action. 
 struct: my meta?
 avdg: just search the word in the description
 Zenoscave: mhm
 struct: I dont even know what my bot does
 Zenoscave: I do
 struct: Its just eval stuff and beam search
 avdg: I have to adapt to the math yet
 Zenoscave: Sweet. So adding some seed position stuff to a beam search and I can probably beat you
 Zenoscave: Just give me 12 days
 MSmits: ah found it
 orangesnowfox: you have 9, lol
 MSmits: Any tree impacted by one of your actions becomes dormant for the rest of the day. A dormant tree cannot be the subject of an action.
 MSmits: i just read the bold stuff that is written about seeding
 struct: MSmits but you can complete and seed that cell
 struct: The cell doesnt become dormant, just the trees and seeds
 avdg: interesting
 Zenoscave: so complete ends tree but not turn?
 MSmits: right but your opponent will see you complete it, so he can seed it too
 Zenoscave: Ah only one complete per turn but at any time. misread
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: only one of anything per turn
 avdg: place tree, chop tree next to it maybe
 struct: Only wait changes round
 MSmits: changes day
 struct: that
 struct: yeah
 struct: I called it round
 MSmits: i like the turns and days terminology
 MSmits: it's most accurate
 struct: yeah
 orangesnowfox: my terms are:turn, day, year :p
 orangesnowfox: a year being 6 days
 MSmits: makes sense
 Zenoscave: or 24&#160;;)
 avdg: subject and days
 Asterixk: XD or a season
 MSmits: year makes more sense since the sun goes round
 avdg: uh maybe action and days
 orangesnowfox: sorry, a year being 10 days, (base 6)
 AntiSquid: damn warmed up food, forgot to eat
 Zenoscave: At least you got the food... I missed that
 orangesnowfox: fun fact, you can call any integer that is at least 2 "10"
 Zenoscave: I also realized I had a doctors apmt 3 hours ago
 Zenoscave: ... 4 hours ago
 MSmits: you realize this at midnight AntiSquid?
 avdg: waiting my last 10% before changing rank...
 struct: How long ago did contest start?
 MSmits: 9 hrs
 struct: so 3 more hours
 Zenoscave: 9 hrs in 3 min and 48s
 icecream17: can you grow trees in wood 2?
 struct: no
 icecream17: it doesnt  seem like it
 Westicles: The russians are very quiet so far.  Normally they are on about partisan game theory or whatnot by now
 struct: only complete
 icecream17: ok
 avdg: you can in wood 1
 MSmits: are you spying on the russians again
 Astrobytes: The game doesn't quite fit into that category Westicles, at least not the way I see it
 struct: 3 japanese in top 10 
 struct: damn
 struct: top 5
 MSmits: all temporary
 Zenoscave: and 2 C#'s rek me currently
 MSmits: these are mostly heuristic bots i think
 orangesnowfox: I mean, it's what...8 am in Japan?
 struct: only mine is permanent
 avdg: Japan is very automated&#160;:-)
 struct:&#160;:)
 avdg: though still lots of paper too
 MSmits: i wonder if you have a gold or legend bot struct
 MSmits: it's for sure gold, but might not be legend
 struct: I would say gold
 struct: Im not even sure if its gold
 Zenoscave: Think you'll place top3&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I'm out, gn all, cya's tomorrow
 MSmits: i am
 struct: But I cant be sure
 Hjax: cya astro
 MSmits: gold is easy to get into 
 Zenoscave: gn
 struct: No way Zenoscave
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 struct: gn astro
 Zenoscave: top 20???
 struct: top 50 max
 Zenoscave: I mean with improvements. not curent
 avdg: finally got into bronze
 struct: I had so much troubles with eval
 MSmits: with so many players participating, top 50 is very hard to get into
 struct: it was not fun
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, have good Astronights
 AntiSquid: struct remove all restrictions from your bot
 AntiSquid: see how far it gets
 MSmits: it's nr 1 now lol
 AntiSquid: but it's restricted
 struct: well its capped at depth 20
 struct: further doesnt mean better
 Zenoscave: wait until it's 2nd and then immediately resub non-restrict
 MSmits: probably not
 MSmits: 20 is very high
 Zenoscave: True
 struct: depth 20 is turns not days
 struct: just to be sure&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: gotta hit next super sayajin level struct
 MSmits: still quite high
 struct: true
 MSmits: 20 turns is probably 5-6 days
 Zenoscave: That's like ~5-7 turns?
 Zenoscave: *days
 struct: maybe
 Zenoscave: I'm in range to battle struct. lets see it lose...
 MSmits: try not to say too much, I have already guessed what kind of search you have struct
 Zenoscave: it being my bot ofc
 struct: Also I my AI doesnt take into account that enemy can move
 MSmits: well now i am sure :P
 XeroOl: wait, the enemy can move?!?
 struct: Ive already said MSmits
 MSmits: ah ok
 Zenoscave: Oh yeah I def need to consider that
 orangesnowfox: wait, this isn't 2048????
 MSmits: XeroOl yes, they are Ents
 MSmits: if you seed the middle, it automatically gets named Treebeard
 AntiSquid: but that doesn't mean beamsearch is best for this contest ... does it
 struct: no
 struct: As I said before I tested in the void
 Zenoscave: probably not I'd think
 struct: I had no real AIs to test against
 MSmits: probably some variation of it is
 Zenoscave: smitsimax miight do better here no?
 struct: Only could test vs my AIs
 MSmits: doubtful
 Zenoscave: Or some variation of dual trees
 MSmits: i already ruled it out myself
 struct: Smitsimax is very hard to implement here
 MSmits: because
 MSmits: cells get blocked by opponent
 struct: ^
 Zenoscave: ah gotcha
 MSmits: also different iterations give different sunpoint counts
 MSmits: thats even worse
 MSmits: because some actions wont be affordable
 MSmits: and some will
 struct: I have 4 algorithms that I tested
 struct: or 3?
 Zenoscave: Currently just a ply 0 sort here
 MSmits: there's no reason you cant do some variation of BS though, some modified version
 struct: yeah Ill try some BS 2 player variant
 XeroOl: anybody have just heuristics with no actual algorithm?
 orangesnowfox: I was just gonna try minimax and see how that turned out lol
 Zenoscave: I bet heuristic pruning would also help
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: XeroOl almost everyone i think
 struct: I dont prune at all
 struct: I only prune on last turn
 Zenoscave: minimax isn't quite applicible here orangesnowfox
 MSmits: why would there be any point to pruning on the last turn
 struct: you dont want to grow
 struct: Its useless
 orangesnowfox: Zenoscave, is it not? how about slightly modified?
 MSmits: yes but you can just keep the highest scoring state and you dont need to even store the rest
 MSmits: so it's not really pruning, since the tree ends
 Zenoscave: That assumes turn based but not simulataneous
 struct: yeah
 Zenoscave: ^ orangesnowfox
 orangesnowfox: "how about slightly modified"
 struct: My eval wasnt very good 
 orangesnowfox: 2 ply
 orangesnowfox: "require pairs of 2 ply"
 Zenoscave: But who goes first?
 Zenoscave: And how do you cancel moves that would intefere with opponent?
 struct: who?
 MSmits: even a 2 ply full search start lets you start with 100+ states
 orangesnowfox: Okay, how about *heavily* modified, do your "turn" do their "turn" and then actually apply it
 Zenoscave: Honestly just cartesian product the branches and do a beam search
 MSmits: Zenoscave that gives you 100+ states to BS from
 struct: There has been states that I had 80 actions in one turn
 icecream17: oh yeah wood 1
 Zenoscave: Yeah but I bet even 5 ply that'd do well
 struct: you will need to prune
 MerryMentat: Is there a way to get Console Input for debugging purposes?
 Zenoscave: With pruning ofcourse
 icecream17: no i just picked the tree that gives the most pts every time
 struct: print to stderr MerryMentat
 MerryMentat: Sure - I suppose that works.
 icecream17: which, if you have 1 day, is the optimal strategy
 MerryMentat: Lotsa copy pasting back out.
 MerryMentat: Thanks!
 MSmits: the fact that the game has trees and search algorithms have trees is going to cause some confusion
 orangesnowfox: lol totally
 struct: ah wait MerryMentat I didnt read properly, give me a sec
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 struct: Check that MerryMentat
 MerryMentat: Will do - thanks!
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, no, beam search sounds better here
 Zenoscave: I'll probably finish sim and test a cartesian opp BS
 Zenoscave: ... tomorrow
 struct: What is cartesian opp Zenoscave?
 Zenoscave: Product of states. |BranchBoth| = |BracnhMe| x |BranchOpp|
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Cartesian_Product_qtl1.svg/1200px-Cartesian_Product_qtl1.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Cartesian_Product_qtl1.svg/1200px-Cartesian_Product_qtl1.svg.png</a>
 ZarthaxX: BS?
 ZarthaxX: bruteforce search?
 Zenoscave: beam search
 ZarthaxX: ah
 AntiSquid: bullshit
 ZarthaxX: you just said fancy words
 ZarthaxX: :D
 orangesnowfox: lol
 orangesnowfox: Funny words, magic man
 Zenoscave: all software is AntiSquid
 icecream17: wow i just got the joke
 icecream17: wow
 AntiSquid: which one?
 Zenoscave: the funny one
 Zenoscave: yours&#160;;)
 struct: zeno you are quite high too
 struct: nice
 Zenoscave: A proper sim or better seeding would do wonders
 XeroOl: implementing a search means I'll have to do the shadow code
 Zenoscave: Thinking about being more agressive shadowing
 XeroOl: which isn't hard, it would just be painful
 LeviathanProgramming: yay I'm 12813th on the leaderboadr.
 LeviathanProgramming: leaderboard
 avdg: already got the shadow code, its not that hard
 XeroOl: I'm at ~105
 XeroOl: #1 for Lua lol
 Vinay96: anyone else getting a bug in C#?
 Zenoscave: no
 XeroOl: What bug? Vinay96
 Zenoscave: What's the bug you're seeing
 Zenoscave: also thx struct forgot to say
 Vinay96: "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 avdg: less than 30 lines of code for shadow code
 XeroOl: avdg are you doing a search?
 Zenoscave: You forgot to do enough Console.ReadLine()'s
 avdg: yeah but only once a turn a tree
 struct: or you output more than 1 time per turn
 Zenoscave: or that ^
 Smelty: yes
 yuusanlondon: hmm im yet to implement a search- not even sure how i'd go about doing that
 Vinay96: the error goes away when i don't "Console.WriteLine($"GROW {number}"); "
 Smelty: which ids have higher fertility?
 avdg: 2 for loops, 2 if's
 Zenoscave: 0 - 6
 XeroOl: when are you writing the line? Vinay
 yuusanlondon: evaluating the board seems difficult
 Smelty: Vinay96: check if you outputed any other ones
 XeroOl: you can only write WAIT or GROW or COMPLETE
 XeroOl: you can't do more than one in one turn
 Zenoscave: yuusanlondon you're doing well for it being difficult&#160;;)
 Vinay96: oh okay let me check
 Smelty: which cellindex's have higher fertility&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: 0-6
 Smelty: ok
 Zenoscave: smelty
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: i thought u was responding to someone else the first time
 Zenoscave: 80% of my losses are in the top 5
 XeroOl: too bad you can't include unicode in the message
 avdg: I need to add some smarter logics in my ai
 avdg: it basically filters commands a bit and then pick a random one now
 avdg: but I call it a day for now
 yuusanlondon: Zenoscave haha thanks- my bot's had quite a few losses to you. Will look into and see what I can learn from them!
 Zenoscave: or dont... I wanna keep winning&#160;;)
 yuusanlondon: :joy:
 avdg: rip I'm the only one in my country using typescript
 Smelty: :rofl:
 Smelty: rip
 Smelty: im using java :flushed:
 avdg: gl
 Smelty: so, teaching your bot to grow trees more often in fertile places is pretty good
 avdg: and gn
 Smelty: g n
 ChrisJM: Will MiniMax modified for simultaneous actions have the same time-complexity as sequential actions?  It seems 2 players making n moves will have the same number of outcomes regardless.
 Smelty: umdy
 struct: isnt it your actions * opponent actions?
 icecream17: ooh yes. in the source code it seems you can add comments to your output. And the regex uses`\s.*` so any whitespace followed by any character
 Smelty: hm
 XeroOl: also, the during-day order of the actions matters
 ChrisJM: That would be the same if you took n actions then they took n actions.  n*n
 XeroOl: whoever attempts to plant first wins
 ChrisJM: I guess I mean 2 sequential turns have the same number of outcomes as a turn where both players act at the same time.
 icecream17: no way! my suboptimal bot hasnt lost yet? a miracle!
 icecream17: ok it just lost to #1 and #2. but im beating the boss
 Zenoscave: does distance thrown for seed matter?
 struct: no
 Zenoscave: ok
 Zenoscave: no sap cost difference?
 MSmits: just don<i>t throw it off the map</i>
 struct: nope
 Zenoscave: how much does a seed cost then? Is it always 2?
 Zenoscave: depending on the number you have planted right?
 struct: min cost is 0
 struct: popcount(trees[0])
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 AntiSquid: potato time
 JP7: the cost to plant a seed is just the number of seeds you currently have planted, no?
 struct: yes
 JP7: :thumbsup:
 Johnny_tec: lol
 Johnny_tec: this reverse exercice
 Zenoscave: how many losses do you have struct?
 struct: 12/240
 elderlybeginner: what's general strategy for the contest?
 Zenoscave: more than I expected
 JP7: dont lose
 Zenoscave: Rn is all heuristic 
 JP7: generally winning is good plan too
 Zenoscave: elderlybeginner plant early watch for shadow
 elderlybeginner: that's the outcome, not the way
 elderlybeginner: heuristics?
 Zenoscave: mhm
 Zenoscave: Only struct is using a search afaik
 elderlybeginner: seems to me that the contest is going to go into minimax later on. I have no experience to make statements, thou
 Zenoscave: not minimax. game state is simulataneous
 Snef: does anyone have issues with viewer&#160;? i have only grey screen
 geio: nop
 Zenoscave: use ff snef. chrome's been doing that
 Snef: Zenoscave ok thanks
 Zenoscave: yw
 thomasgonda3: im also getting a grey screen on the player for this challenge specifically
 AeroFufel: Got my 11th rank. I'm sure the big guys will come later, since mine expected to be waaaay lower.
 Zenoscave: nice AeroFufel
 Zenoscave: bah 39/40 
 Zenoscave: so close

 Nerchio: :thumbsup:
 Smelty: lel
 Smelty: zeno rip
 Zenoscave: hm?
 Smelty: nothin
 Smelty: *39/40*
 Zenoscave: ah yeah
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: omg no accidentally hit resubmit-now ill have to wiat for it to go again augh
 MACKEYTH: It's going a lot faster now in Bronze.
 Smelty: wait is it only to bronze league or is there higher ones as well
 Zenoscave: higher ones get released starting monday
 MACKEYTH: Just Bronze for now.
 Zenoscave: but the rules are the same. just stronger bots from opponents
 Smelty: ahh
 Smelty: i see
 MACKEYTH: I wonder how strong the Bronze boss will be
 Zenoscave: you'll be good for bronze-&gt;silver MACKEYTH
 Zenoscave: never that high
 Smelty: just waiting for my ranking to settle, then ill be in bronze
 Smelty: -
 Smelty: wel i just got promoted
 JP7: nicenice
 Smelty: edit:10 seconds
 Smelty: also, ooo you can plant in bronze
 ftpud: "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time." woops
 Zenoscave: gotta let it cooldown ftpud
 ftpud: that means it's time for a sleep :zzz:
 JP7: reject rate limits
 Smelty: ooof
 JP7: embrace locally built game
 TWW: the game visual section is just gray and empty for me... i've tried mutliple browsers
 Zenoscave: there's something to do with graphic acceleration you can change but I can't remember...
 JP7: all w/ hardware acceleration enabled?
 Zenoscave: ^ this
 TWW: at a site/account or browser level?
 JP7: that is a browser setting
 TWW: that did it, thanks!
 JP7: awesome, happy to helo o7
 JP7: *help
 JP7: I english
 fvla: What happens if you throw an uncaught exception in C++ here?
 Theino: is there a timeline for silver league being released for the contest?
 Zenoscave: monday
 Theino: thx
 cegprakash: any referee shared?
 Zenoscave: just the official
 cegprakash: link plz
 Zenoscave: it's in the instructions
 cegprakash: got it!
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/tree/main/starterAIs">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/tree/main/starterAIs</a> just in case
 icecream17: dang a lot of people are claiming the trees at the end! that's smart
 struct: I dont think so
 Zenoscave: They're worth less points that way
 icecream17: ... I don't see how big trees are worth less when claimed at the end vs the start
 MACKEYTH: Nutrient bonus
 icecream17: ohhh right
 Smelty: yee in top 1000
 hyphz: Yes lol my wood 2 program is 842 in bronze because it claims its trees ASAP 
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: yea claim asap is better
 Smelty: i mean like itl cost less to grow up the next tree
 Smelty: so
 JP7: The reason you'dclaim at the end is likely because having trees up == sun sustain
 MACKEYTH: Big trees are good sun producers, but you want to complete them ASAP for that sweet, sweet nutrient
 MACKEYTH: That's one of the major balance axes in this challenge
 fvla: nutrients are not only a finite resource, but also constantly decreasing
 Smelty: yes, sweeeeeeeet nutrient
 fvla: well, decreasing if your opponent claims them
 Atatakakatta: it's all about the balance
 Atatakakatta: hopefully your code can figure that out
 Atatakakatta: my greedy strategy is getting me to the top 10% in Bronze but no further
 Atatakakatta: you know what would be cool? having the winning program go up against a human
 fvla: either i will figure it out or i will make a neural network figure it out
 Smelty: trueeee
 fvla: oh yeah, that sounds cool for this turn-based game
 Smelty: made a bot that made my old bot, submitting, hoping for best lol
 Atatakakatta: although if I tought my code how to throw a seed more than 1 hex it might help lol
 Smelty: *beat my old bot
 Smelty: atakakatta same lol
 hyphz: I thought you'd actually written a bot for creating bots there
 Atatakakatta: although that's not really what's hurting me, it's more balanced strategies and stupid timeouts I can't diagnose
 Atatakakatta: where's our debugger?
 icecream17: stderr for print debugging is there =)
 fvla: download it and connect it all together
 Smelty: p
 Atatakakatta: time to print every variable huh?
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: i currently print each possible reason for not passing an if
 fvla: maybe mock up the game with your own implementation
 MoMaT: the game description was written by someone with poor understanding of the Sun &lt;-&gt; Earth relation, or a flatearther.
 MoMaT: the shadow angle doesn't change from day to day.
 MoMaT: it changes from hour to hour.
 fvla: precession, my friend
 fvla: there is no such thing as night
 fvla: eternal day
 MoMaT: there is. you have no moves at night.
 Zenoscave: MoMaT, or it's a game and they needed a dynamic to add to it
 MoMaT: actually, the board games has expansion where there is moon and its phases.
 Smelty: game between two similar versions between my bot currently o.O
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547371428">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547371428</a>
 MoMaT: it would work perfectly fine if it is described as 4 days, and 6 day times: morning, afternnon, evening, etc.
 Atatakakatta: maybe I had too much text debugging and that was causing the timeouts lol
 MoMaT: and then it would not be wrong in astronomical terms...
 Atatakakatta: I had that happen before in another coding challenge
 Atatakakatta: I/O takes lots of time!
 fvla: the tree upgrade cost function is really interesting
 MACKEYTH: Yeah it does
 Smelty: teaching my ai to plant towards center, hoping for best...
 fvla: i/o is so expensive
 Smelty: major success <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547373527">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547373527</a>
 Smelty: it likes the center now lol
 MACKEYTH: Smelty - I found it easier to plant towards richer soil than to worry about actual position in the forest
 MoMaT: also turns are not really turns but actions / moves. a turn is 1 of 6 parts of a day...
 MoMaT: overall, this games seems to have complicated description bot not much of a breadth. I predict optimisation bonanza.
 Smelty: yep thats what im doing kidna
 Atatakakatta: the strategy is pretty simple really
 Smelty: looking to plant towards more fertile areas
 Atatakakatta: in a human sense at least
 Smelty: top 10%
 Atatakakatta: the main important decision is trying to decide how early to start harvesting
 Atatakakatta: too early and you run out of resources, too late and you don't get enough points from each tree
 Smelty: lmao i just dominated a whole match but then forgot to harvest
 Smelty: rip
 MACKEYTH: I'm trying to figure out how struct keeps beating me by 2 trees
 Atatakakatta: at the very very top level, I suspect the shade and stuff will come into play
 Atatakakatta: but that's like top 1% stuff
 Atatakakatta: aha, I think I fixed it
 Atatakakatta: fear me, top 10%
 Smelty: lol im 152 rn
 Atatakakatta: I was 167 and that was with a bug
 Smelty: also, ive decided to shut down the trees after round 20
 icecream17: 241, so technically i dont have to fear you
 Atatakakatta: yeah I just added shutdown stuff too
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: resubmitted hoping for best
 Smelty: also, im surprised struct is 1st o.O
 struct: I tested the game
 Atatakakatta: lost my first battle after resubmitting and got knocked down to like 800 oof
 Smelty: ah thats why struct
 Smelty: struc = pro
 struct: not only that
 Smelty: bruv my current ai spams seeds
 fvla: MoMaT, about "optimization bonanza," the description literally says the following:"Two wood spirits have started to compete over which one is the most efficient."
 Smelty: in a smart way, but like still
 Smelty: yeeep
 Smelty: also they have names
 Atatakakatta: what decides who's #1 and who's #2? in the battles. Is it who's the favorite?
 MoMaT: true, but I like more a competition on strategic level, that is which spirit is more creative...
 fvla: if you want strategy, then get to the top!
 Smelty: Red=Tororo and Blue=Ghilbib&#160;:))
 icecream17: oh yeah i tested against smelty and this happened: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547380538">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547380538</a>
 Smelty: hmm
 Smelty: my newest submit or not
 Atatakakatta: you can always revert
 icecream17: newest
 fvla: I thought Blue Wood 2 boss was Tororo, Smelty
 MoMaT: I'm afraid there will be no strategy in this game, just efficiency...
 fvla: there is strategy
 Smelty: OOF CLOSE MATCH
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: can you make multiple actions per turn? I find the wording slightly confusing
 icecream17: i wonder how search works when 2 players play at the same time
 fvla: you have to compete for fertile soil
 icecream17: that's another great user username
 Bashar: how can i see the CoC leaderboards?
 Smelty: fvla look at the gameplay before you test in ide
 Smelty: the like background thing
 Smelty: with the challenge logo on it
 icecream17: notsurewhy - you can play 1 each turn, but multiple times in a day
 fvla: Smelty, you're right about about that
 Smelty: icecream17 tbh I think i'm doing good for using if/else
 fvla: But I don't know if it's canon
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: how come it says "as long as you have enough sun points, you can take any number of actions" Kind of misleading then
 Smelty: xD
 Hjax: NotSureWhyThisWorks you can make any number of actions per day as long as you have enough sun points
 Hjax: not per turn
 fvla: my garbage bot is actually ~600 rn
 KelvinAndHubbles: I mean, trees become dormant and everything, so it's technically an action till it's not
 Smelty: oh i havent optimized my algorithm.....i forgot that you can have seeds from plants that aint level 3
 fvla: ...why do tildes become dashes?
 Smelty: hmmst
 icecream17: huh? my submit did worse???
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Thanks Hjax
 icecream17: oh wait 45% nvm
 Atatakakatta: @smelty yeah that'll help a lot &gt;_&gt;
 MoMaT: @fvla, I'm happy to talk to you again next Monday, when people describe their bots. I bet there would be very little difference between best eval functions. And no tricks, no tactical play, no outsmarting the opponent... It's just not "unleashe the geek"-style of competiotion...
 Smelty: lololololol
 MACKEYTH: fvla: char relaxer
 Smelty: and yet im in the 200s without it
 struct: Guess I wont submit until gold opens to see if my bot gets there
 icecream17: btw, whoever asked above, the leaderboard is at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global</a>
 Atatakakatta: @momat I think pure optimization will get you very close to the top, true
 Atatakakatta: but not all the way there
 fvla: ^
 icecream17: or click "back" topleft then "leaderboard"tab
 Wontonimo: how would optimization NOT get you to the top?
 fvla: you have to play competitively if you want to edge out the best players
 Atatakakatta: because there's another player? the shade mechanic?
 fvla: remember, seed collisions
 Smelty: jo wpmtpmo,p
 davilla: how are seed collisions resolved?
 fvla: and you have to play around opponent shade too, that's true
 Atatakakatta: seed collisions are zero-sum really
 Smelty: *hi wontonimo
 Atatakakatta: but shade isn't
 fvla: read the doc
 fvla: for seed collisions
 davilla: I can't, I'm not there yet
 struct: seed collisions make the trees dormant
 struct: nothing else
 Wontonimo: *hi Smelty
 fvla: seed collisions zero-sum???
 icecream17: aw i was about to type a worse explanation
 Smelty: hi wontonimo
 Atatakakatta: @fvla sure, why not? both players lose the same amount
 Wontonimo: hey hey Smelty
 Smelty: protip: test against ur last submission before submitting
 Smelty: lol
 Atatakakatta: I guess it hurts you a bit less if you're already ahead
 Smelty: currently around 300, feeling good
 davilla: everything is zero sum in a zero sum game
 icecream17: i wonder if a dormant tree can throw seeds
 Atatakakatta: I guess zero-sum wasn't the right term
 icecream17: because if it can... then... infinite loop
 Atatakakatta: I meant, affects both players similarly
 Atatakakatta: not really something you can take advantage of
 davilla: "fair"
 Wontonimo: i have just an if/then bot and stuck at 550.  tomorrow i may start on my simulation bot
 Atatakakatta: my if-then bot is in the top 200!
 Atatakakatta: AI is overrated
 icecream17: ok, i'm pretty sure my new bot is worse (somehow)
 Wontonimo: cool Atatakakatta&#160;!  That's pretty good.
 itzluku: what leagues are u guys?
 struct: is my AI if else?
 struct: maybe
 Smelty:  realized i wrote 50 useless lines of code for planting next to urself
 MACKEYTH: My current bot isn't doing any sim. You can get a long way on if-then
 Smelty: wellllll my ai is if/else
 Smelty: o
 itzluku: wait bronze is max&#160;?
 Atatakakatta: for now, yes
 struct: for now
 itzluku: so i am #79 of all&#160;?
 struct: heuristics can be nice to use it as the opponent
 icecream17: ooh, an ai that predicts what the opponent will do!
 icecream17: too bad i never actually successfully made an ai
 struct: I dont predict enemy atm
 MoMaT: you don't need AI, min-max is already "predicting" the opponent.
 itzluku: 41.43
 itzluku: what does that mean
 icecream17: how would minmax work if the oppoentn and you play at the same time
 MoMaT: but if you do deeper search then you can run separate move logic different than your own (faster, simpler) for the opponent.
 Wontonimo: icecream17 it really isn't a problem.  just jig the rules to handle collisions
 Smelty: bruv my trees are planting in sub-optimal places
 Atatakakatta: oh, blame the trees will you
 Smelty: sad noise
 fvla: icecream17 it means you might need RPS or attrition force at some times
 MoMaT: it doesn't matter if it's simultaneous or not, before you make tour own move, you take it into account.
 fvla: simultaneity *does* matter
 Smelty: eeeeee
 fvla: it introduces imperfect information
 MoMaT: not for applying minimax, the principle remains the same.
 fvla: might not matter much for most, but it makes a difference
 icecream17: ok, here's an idea
 icecream17: each turn, take all move i have * all move opp has
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=minimax+simultaneous+moves">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=minimax+simultaneous+moves</a>
 Smelty: yes
 icecream17: then...
 icecream17: uh
 fvla: that is where you have to get creative
 fvla: branching factor there is far too high
 MoMaT: only when your move is made not effective bu the opponents move. which us I think only one case. all the others are not interacting.
 Atatakakatta: just make a decision tree for the whole game, shouldn't be too hard, right?
 Atatakakatta: am I the only one that read the part about shade
 struct: Atatakakatta game state is too big
 Wontonimo: don't throw shade here
 Smelty: shade is a thing
 Smelty: but like i just ignore it lol
 fvla: imagine if the gold boss does shade optimizations
 Wontonimo: struct i think Atata was joking (i hope)
 Smelty: lMAo
 MoMaT: thx @Wontonimo, saves time :P
 icecream17: if only I could trick the game into sending all possible actions just randomly in the middle of my turn so i wouldn't have to calculate it
 Atatakakatta: oh of course I'm not actually -using- shade
 davilla: a nondeterministic game where you win in at least one version of reality? too easy
 Atatakakatta: but theoretically it does make it a competitive game and not just a pure optimization problem
 Smelty: yes finally fixed the glithces
 Smelty: now...submiT
 Wontonimo: so, does shade stack?  if there are two size 2 trees in a row, does only the first tree cast shade?
 Smelty: shade does not
 Smelty: stack
 struct: it does
 Smelty: like in real life
 Smelty: wait what
 Smelty: ok
 Smelty: ignore me
 <b>**Smelty sobs in corner</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: like in real life aswell 
 Rag: xd
 Smelty: true didnt account for holes in trees lol
 struct: I mean the shade :p
 Atatakakatta: all trees cast shadows
 Wontonimo: lol
 MoMaT: you can score shade as you score anything else. surely the gold boss will do that. it's only a question of how far ahead it will look.
 Atatakakatta: but they don't "stack"
 aangairbender: are the forest settings always the same? I mean grid size and richness positions? (high quality in the center, low quality on the sides)
 davilla: except in real life the second full tree would get a smidge of light
 Atatakakatta: at least in bronze league, it seems like the general pattern is the same but there are random 0 spots
 icecream17: it's quite silly that the forest creatures are scared of shadows.
 Smelty: yes davilla
 Wontonimo: i dont believe it davilla , trees block 100% up to their height because sun is always at 45 degrees
 TheRadical: In Spring Challange 2021 the game does not render for me its just a grey rectangle. I am using chrome 90 on ubuntu 18
 Smelty: wot
 MoMaT: install Firefox.
 Smelty: ah yes that problem again
 TheRadical: other games work does anyone have something similar?
 struct: TheRadical try disabling and enabling hardware accelaration
 Smelty: bruv howd struc get 56.60
 Atatakakatta: being good
 Smelty: meanwhile im stuck at 36
 Atatakakatta: beating everyone
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/struct">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/struct</a>
 Atatakakatta: honestly I'm shocked my code is doing as well as it is
 Atatakakatta: it's reallllly simple
 Smelty: o.O
 davilla: aangairbender your icon looks like you're trying to solve the challenge on a square grid&#160;:-P
 XeroOl: how do I make my code better please thanks?
 Smelty: dangit the playernotfound error again-
 Smelty: XeroOl account for higher nutrients in the center
 Atatakakatta: just implement a neural network
 XeroOl: I know, I am
 Smelty: i mean, you dont need simulation, my if/else gets me to 215 in bronze
 davilla: I've been stuck for a while now on "your code did not read all available input"
 Smelty: davilla lol
 Wontonimo: XeroOl first make worse code, them making it better is easier
 Atatakakatta: @davilla don't mess with the starting code
 Smelty: reset code, see which inputs are missing
 MoMaT: @Atatakakatta, just wait a few days, and you will see your true rank. the competition barely started.
 XeroOl: @wontonimo genius
 MoMaT: it doesn't really matter what your rank is now...
 Smelty: wontonimo lol
 XeroOl: I'm 168
 Smelty: in bronze?
 XeroOl: practically the best in the whole competetion
 XeroOl: yeah bronze
 Smelty: ah then i am of no help to you
 XeroOl: I'm probably going to try to hardcode an opening strategy
 Atatakakatta: well I'm 160 and I just beat you
 Atatakakatta: so there
 davilla: if I could just read all available input, I'm sure I could win this thing...
 Smelty: LOL
 XeroOl: noo!!!
 Atatakakatta: you know starting positions are randomized right?
 XeroOl: yeah I know
 Smelty: yep they arre
 XeroOl: but you start with 2 trees
 XeroOl: so the first 3 days should be pretty much the same
 Smelty: @xero why do you put suboptimal planting positions at the beginning
 Smelty: like in the light green no the green
 XeroOl: what do you mean?
 XeroOl: is there a way you can link a specific game to me?
 Majeck: Hi, are the cells at the start always given in order (0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 36)?
 Smelty: u win in this match, but you start by planting in the light green: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547391785">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547391785</a>
 Atatakakatta: looks like there's a "share" button in the player @xero
 XeroOl: @Majeck yes
 Majeck: Thanks XeroOl!
 Smelty: yes majeck starting with the middle
 XeroOl: I found the atatakakatta vs XeroOl match
 itzluku: anyone tryed backtracking&#160;?
 Smelty: and spiraling out, therefore 0-6 is the best
 itzluku: how much time do we have to make a move
 XeroOl: I need to plant less plants
 XeroOl: so I can sell more at the end
 Smelty: xero lol
 XeroOl: that's what I'll do
 Smelty: also, i dont lose to xero by that much, just like 10 points
 Atatakakatta: 100ms @itzluku
 XeroOl: in that game, the reason it doesn't go straight to green is because the tree is too small to reach the greenx
 itzluku: @Atatakakatta ty
 Atatakakatta: says at the bottom of the description
 itzluku: guys add rock paper scissors to your wait move
 itzluku: xd
 XeroOl: I want to hardcode it to start by jumping straight into green
 XeroOl: I already like what my wait messages say
 itzluku: what
 davilla: "wait for you..."
 Majeck: I used "n" as an iterator for neighbours I feel dirty
 Atatakakatta: oh yeah, Xero, your strategy is too conservative
 Atatakakatta: I take all the nutrients from you &gt;_&gt;
 davilla: you mean as an iterator for neigh?&#160;:-P
 XeroOl: yeah, I don't have an actual AI
 Atatakakatta: I don't either
 XeroOl: you know I have just a collection of if statements, righjt
 Smelty: chat active today xD
 XeroOl: this whole thing is a miserable pile of code
 Atatakakatta: but I have super-greedy strategy compared to your super-boomy strategy
 XeroOl: I'm #1 in the lua category
 XeroOl: because I'm using the worst language ever, Lua
 davilla: first AND last, xeroOl?
 Rag: lol im using php so...
 XeroOl: @davilla lmao
 XeroOl: I'm going to hardcode the first couple turns to be more optimal looking
 Atatakakatta: I'm first in C++ in USA
 Atatakakatta: lol
 XeroOl: oh yeah, checking by region too
 struct: XeroOI sorry to tell you but you are not 1st in lua&#160;:(
 XeroOl: oh I was earlier
 Wontonimo: I'm first when I type my name in the search&#160;!
 struct: im first.
 davilla: I'm #2 in a 25-foot radius around my house
 icecream17: i have no idea why my code plays different with player 1 vs player 2
 XeroOl: oh lmao did you port to Lua? @struct
 Kuraishi: Starting sun location
 XeroOl: am I misreading this?
 struct: no im not
 struct: Zorg 1 is 1st in lua
 XeroOl: nooooooo
 struct: I meant im first as in first
 XeroOl: yeah
 Wontonimo: good night everyone!  It's great to be in a competition.  See you all tomorrow
 struct: gn
 geio: well is there extra point if we get first place in a specific language
 XeroOl: yeah, I need to just port to Dlang at the last second
 struct: there is an achievement I think
 geio: oh
 XeroOl: that achievement is my purpose in life
 davilla: you may be contacted by a Lua recruiter&#160;:-P
 geio: 1 person is using clojure :p
 struct: Since I always use C++ I will never get that achievement
 XeroOl: hired directly by roblox or something lol
 XeroOl: I think roblox uses lua? I have no idea
 XeroOl: nobody uses lua
 davilla: even people who use Lua are hiring C++ winners I'm guessing
 XeroOl: lmao
 XeroOl: tbh if I werent' using lua I'd be using kotlin or c++
 geio: new plan change my code into bash :p
 Smelty: xD
 davilla: ha yeah! go for the shortest code in legend
 MACKEYTH: Shudder
 itzluku: why do we have to wait 3 days :x
 XeroOl: bash code would just be:echo "my cpp here" &gt; "file.cpp"gcc file.cpp./a.out
 XeroOl: well, g++  but you get the idea
 davilla: so we don't become disillusioned by struct already being legend
 struct: my bot is not legend level
 struct: mid gold at best
 davilla: in that case, I don't know
 ashikujjaman: is there any prize for this contest?
 struct: tshirt for top 20
 MACKEYTH: IDK struct. If Legend was open RN you'd be #1 in it
 XeroOl: lmao I made a change and now I have 2 points
 struct: + art work for top 3

 Smelty: go to leaderboard
 ashikujjaman: did you use any algo for bronze?
 Smelty: if/else
 ashikujjaman: struct?
 itzluku: how did u play against yourself xd
 struct: yes?
 mojojojo: Leaderboard just links me to the profiles of the users and not the battles&#160;:/
 Smelty: there should be a view last battles
 icecream17: oh, i was adding sun and points
 ashikujjaman: struct, did you use any algo (AI)?
 icecream17: i thought there were view last battles?
 Smelty: yep thats what i thought
 struct: yes, I tested the contest, thats why im first atm
 mojojojo: if anyone knows where the option to view last battles is, let me know
 icecream17: i know
 Smelty: go to the contest
 Smelty: dont go to ide
 Smelty: and scroll down
 Smelty: there should be a top 1
 Smelty: *10
 Rag: when we getting bronze boss??
 Smelty: click on leagues
 Smelty: itll show
 Smelty: 5/10
 icecream17: oh i though nutrient went down by 1 each turn! i keep misreading
 itzluku: after 5/10 open end no more time barrier?
 itzluku: not open end but u know what i mean
 mojojojo: got it Smelty, thank you!

 davilla: dammit, I just got promoted to bronze
 davilla: and it still says my code did not read all available input before printing an instruction
 Smelty: davilla i got into bronze with if/else
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: maybe you printed solution before some reading input?
 XeroOl: you can only take one action each turn
 XeroOl: turns&#160;!= days
 davilla: but I am... I've been staring at this for an hour

 Smelty: davilla what language
 XeroOl: this could be one of those forgetting to read the newline things
 Smelty: ye
 davilla: time for the nuclear option
 Rag: If you output multiple things on a loop it will also give you that problem
 Smelty: try comparing the amount of reading to the resetted one

 fvla: click on the league button in the top left
 jrke: 10th may
 fvla: shhhh
 fvla: don't tell him
 fvla: gotta learn the UI
 ashikujjaman: fvla you are right
 fvla: also may 10th is wrong lol
 davilla: earlier today is also wrong, but it's not untrue
 fvla: someone a bit back told me that i look a bit suspicious because i never changed my profile picture
 fvla: so i finally changed it. don't remember who you are, but i hope you're happy
 JP7: lmfao
 JP7: thats glorious
 orangesnowfox: ... Trees... Trees take up _exactly_ 9 bits (well, technically *slightly* less, because there aren't 64 cells, but still)
 fvla: ...9 bits???
 orangesnowfox: 5 for the index, 2 for the growth level, 1 for if you own it or not, 1 for if it's dormant or not
 XeroOl: my trees take up at least 24 bytes lol
 orangesnowfox: lol wot? why
 XeroOl: because I'm writing this in lua
 orangesnowfox: ah
 fvla: F
 XeroOl: actually more, because they're doubles, not floats
 XeroOl: so at least 32 bytes
 orangesnowfox: my currently take 4, because I haven't bit boarded them yet...Oh, trees are unique in position
 XeroOl: if not more
 orangesnowfox: doubles?
 orangesnowfox: wat
 XeroOl: lua doesn't have ints
 fvla: wtf, how do you use floats for trees???
 orangesnowfox: ... oh
 fvla: huh
 XeroOl: so any numbers are just floats with whole number values
 orangesnowfox: fvla, not the data structure, the entity
 fvla: you can probably pack then?
 XeroOl: don't use lua
 fvla: pack multiple trees into one float
 fvla: orangesnowfox i know
 orangesnowfox: Oh, if I have an array of 37 they take up exactly one byte, this pleases me
 orangesnowfox: ... But then lookups are longer
 orangesnowfox: bleh
 Atatakakatta: how much of bronze league is going to get promoted anyway? anyone know?
 fvla: b i t b o a r d s
 fvla: probably hundreds, if not over a thousand
 orangesnowfox: Also, lol, not exactly 1 byte, exactly 5 bits... (2 for size, 1 for mine, 1 for dormant, 1 for "exists")
 fvla: why are you concerned with size?
 orangesnowfox: "because that's what I do" lol
 fvla: if you look at chess engines, they don't pack optimally for size
 fvla: they pack optimally for manipulation speed
 orangesnowfox: Yes...
 fvla: bit shifttttttttttt
 orangesnowfox: yeee
 phord: Hm.  Advanced two leagues without resubmitting. Does my bot keep playing in the new league after I advance?
 fvla: I think so?
 orangesnowfox: yes phord, it goes back down to 0% as if you just submitted it
 phord: :thumbsup_tone3:
 phord: Well, shit.  Now the rules changed again.  lol
 orangesnowfox: Bronze now?
 orangesnowfox: They'll stop doing that
 LLG: is there any way to get small sized bitboards in c#?
 orangesnowfox: I mean, I do my bitboarding via integers, so
 orangesnowfox: probably? although, integer promotion is going to be a pain for you
 _Lupus_: Are the shadows not updated during the day? So if I grow a tree during the day, is it true that this tree does NOT cast a shadow until the sun moves?
 orangesnowfox: Why not check? :p 
 Hjax: _Lupus_ it doesnt matter, because you only get sun points when the sun moves 
 _Lupus_: How? From the animation it looks like shadows are only updated when a day passes
 Hjax: thats when you get sun points 
 _Lupus_: Thanks Hjax, you are right. I had the board game rules in mind where you cannot grow a tree if it is shaded
 Hjax: ah interesting, i didnt know that was a rule in the board game
 _Lupus_: It's an optional rule. To make the game more interesting&#160;:)
 davilla: this is based on a board game?
 _Lupus_: @davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218603/photosynthesis">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218603/photosynthesis</a>

 fvla: I see
 davilla: wow cool, project alpha girl is almost believably enthusiastic, almost
 Majeck: Can you do more than one action per "turn"?
 Majeck: "As long as you have enough sun points, you can take any number of actions. "
 Majeck: Nevermind haha
 XeroOl: it's not per "turn"
 XeroOl: you have to do one action per "turn"
 XeroOl: but you can do more than one in a day
 Majeck: Thanks!
 XeroOl: the day ends once you say "WAIT"
 XeroOl: so you can keep spending points all you want, or you can skip to the next day with a "WAIT"
 XeroOl: but you have to read in all the stuff every turn
 Majeck: What happens if I never say "WAIT"?
 XeroOl: at some point, when you don't have enough points, WAIT will be your only valid action
 XeroOl: or if all the trees become dormant
 Majeck: Perfect
 XeroOl: Hopefully that makes sense
 Majeck: It does, thanks!
 Smelty:  go rank 100
 Smelty: *llets go
 icecream17: :O first 10 games were all wins
 phord: I'm in the sweet part of the simulation: when the code is all logical and fat.  But I keep imagining the optimization I'll need to do later where everything becomes a bit mask.  :scream:
 phord: It's going to be a shit show, I can feel it.
 icecream17: so i added something. when i only have enough time to upgrade all my trees, i cant waste any of it planting some more
 phord: Time limit?  Oh, 24 days.
 Atatakakatta: 24 in bronze at least, I think the description implied it might change?
 orangesnowfox: They'll probably only change it if there's a balance change
 MACKEYTH: Huh. I think I actually may have done something useful with shade.
 orangesnowfox: mm?
 MACKEYTH: Hard to tell }:/
 orangesnowfox: what thing?
 phord: Ah, and there's also the 1000/100ms time limits. 
 e-boot: normally the rules don't change after bronze
 icecream17: I want to plant seeds but i also want to upgrade&#160;!!! So the only way forward is to implement search
 MACKEYTH: Trying to base grow/complete decisions on whether or not the tree will be shaded next turn.
 Jodelfogel: does "number_of_possible_actions" include my opoonents actions as well, or solely mine?
 icecream17: only yours
 orangesnowfox: solely yours
 Smelty: completely update my algo, gained 5 ranks&#160;;-;
 orangesnowfox: well, yeah, other people got better too :p
 Jodelfogel: alrite, thank you 
 KelvinAndHubbles: better then changing your algo and then losing ranks&#160;:/
 Smelty: lol
 icecream17: smelty absolutely demolishes me even though i'm only around 70 places behind
 MACKEYTH: Kudos for the funny messages Wrathzog
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: when ur in the top 10%, competition gets fierce
 e-boot: If it's a 5-&gt;1, it's all good
 icecream17: ok. i got it. seed early to get the good spots and upgrade as much as possible
 icecream17: although in the first few turns maybe upgrade to get some seed range
 pluto-de: ok noob question so sorry in advance: why can't I see the game window? All I get is a gray screen. I disabled all the extensions that could break a site, perhaps I need to switch off Firefox?

 pluto-de: fix?
 davilla: close down your browser
 pluto-de: ahh the classic "alt+f4 method"
 davilla: yeah... something was mentioned about hardware acceleration too if that doesn't work
 davilla: off and on again
 phord: Shadow remains the same until the next day, even after turn where a tree is COMPLETEd or GROWn, right?  
 oggdestroy: I have the same version of chrome on one computer as another but only one has the issue. I just opened it in edge
 _Lupus_: @phord: correct. If you have the board game rules in mind like I did before, forget them :D
 davilla: as I understand it, that's inconsequential as sun points are only earned at beginning
 phord: So, order of actions doesn't matter except for SEED, and there it matters because we race with opp.
 _Lupus_: Here shadow is only important when the sun moves (because that is when you get income)
 Jodelfogel: does the server instantly recalculate new "possible actions " if i print my move then immediately after scanf the possible actions, would it be refreshed?, or do i have to wait for one game loop to finish? (sorry im super noob)
 _Lupus_: So it is ok to only update the shadow then
 Smelty:  tbh i kinda forgot what some of my variables do
 davilla: wouldn't completing trees also be a race, for nutrition value?
 Smelty: hmm
 davilla: nutrient*
 _Lupus_: @Jodelfogel: possible actions are immediately updated next turn
 phord: Oh, yeah. "Complete a lifecycle".
 Smelty: o-oh my
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547491263">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547491263</a> ooh cworld record for closest game!
 Smelty: meh i had ties in the 130s before lol
 Atatakakatta: I mean, I had a tie on points just recently
 Smelty: but...wow
 Smelty: sighs...struc still demolishes me 100%
 actualCoderTrevor: My bot's not even good enough to face him
 Smelty: rippp
 itzluku: is there a way to challenge top10 bots
 Smelty: just go to ide u can test vs him there
 Smelty: u can see that you can delete players and replace them with others
 icecream17: 156!??
 Smelty:&#160;?
 icecream17: how is the yellow bar so colorful
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh really?
 Smelty: lol
 icecream17: struc vs me: 156 to 91
 Smelty: u didnt use some variables?
 Smelty: dangggg
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh cool!
 Smelty: pro we noob
 Smelty: *struc pro
 itzluku: was ~#70 soem hours ago, now i tryed sth more complex and im out of top100 xD
 icecream17: although struc's eloskill is 56.76 and im at skill 38.66
 Smelty: not sure if enemies better or ur was worse
 itzluku: hm yeh
 Smelty: eee just submitted a new code with (what i hope are) funnier comments
 itzluku: still processing 46% 230 now
 Smelty: o.o
 itzluku: lets so how far i get
 itzluku: see*
 icecream17: struc is really getting that sun
 Smelty: processing 12%, 622
 Smelty: icecream i once ended with 300 sun
 Smelty: xD
 itzluku: 65% 180
 itzluku: Oo
 Smelty: curently processed 20%, 190
 itzluku: nice
 icecream17: 169! - world record pts by struc
 Smelty: oh ye icecream my bot keeps winning by like 2
 Smelty: WOW
 Smelty: *20
 itzluku: jesus i'm getting crushed
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/547495292">https://www.codingame.com/replay/547495292</a>
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: w-whos rickrolling
 icecream17: shhh
 Smelty: ooooooooook
 Smelty: bruv i keep beating you by just 20
 Smelty: i want a higher margin lol

 Smelty: 57% processed, 100
 Smelty: tbh i spend the first hour each multiplayer bot game tryan figure out a bot that can actually play without breaking any rules
 nascent: this is open for 11 days?
 nascent: I guess this site is for people who don't have jobs? lol
 Smelty: lol
 karliso: It is not clear to me if my own shadow spooks me as well. From rules it seems like yes, but from replays it seems like no.
 XeroOl: Is it worth changing my code from a bunch of if statements to an actual algorithm that plans ahead?
 XeroOl: @karliso, your own shadow does spook you
 vchapman: if you want to move into silver/gold + you will likely have to do an algo.
 Smelty: Lol
 XeroOl: not on the same tree, but if you have two adjacent trees, they can shade eachother
 XeroOl: oh no I have to write real code
 Smelty: XeroOl not sure man, im doing pretty good with if/else
 XeroOl: instead of if statements in lua
 Smelty: oog
 Smelty: *oof
 XeroOl: search tree algorithms in lua&#160;:)
 Smelty: i swear im going to spend days building a simulation bot and then discover that it consistently loses against my if/else bot
 XeroOl: if/else bot gang
 Majeck: I actually really like this challenge
 XeroOl: yeah, at first I was very scare
 XeroOl: but you actually don't have to do hexagonal pathfinding
 Smelty: omg my code broke now it doesnt know how to plant
 Smelty: bruv
 XeroOl: lmao I've done that
 Smelty: but i dont even know why TwT
 karliso: XeroOl <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/547499643">https://www.codingame.com/replay/547499643</a>
 XeroOl: now it's too scared to plant because it doesn't think it has enough sun for the end
 Smelty: lolol
 karliso: Oh.
 Smelty: OOF 173
 karliso: I forgot that lesser trees don't shadow larger trees.
 Smelty: idk but this is so dum
 Majeck: Compared to Potions if/else and simple algos look really viable on this one
 Majeck: Potions basically forced you to use minmax or some sort of search 
 Smelty: j,,
 Smelty: hmm ye
 Majeck: I mean I'm confident my tiny if/else bot will at least make it to silver lol
 Majeck: In Potions it was a fight against getting 5k or more sims lol
 Smelty: bruhhhhh i dont even know what half of my variables r doing
 Smelty: i have 0 organizational skills
 XeroOl: lmao
 XeroOl: You're using java though right?
 XeroOl: any code written in java is automatically overorganized
 Smelty: uep
 Smelty: lol
 XeroOl: you should see my lua lol
 XeroOl: lua lets you use global variables
 Smelty: problem is, even with the organization, idk what im doing
 XeroOl: want to trade codes?&#160;:)
 Smelty: hmmmmmst
 Smelty: olol
 XeroOl: I'd love to be free from lua right about now
 Smelty: just crashsed code
 Smelty: now it doesnt read all inputs before printing
 Zenoscave: The switch langs
 Zenoscave: then*
 Smelty: uuugh
 XeroOl: but, switch to what?
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: java
 Zenoscave: Whatever you want.
 Smelty: java if/else gang
 XeroOl: but, i don't know
 Zenoscave: or just start a new fresh bot
 Zenoscave: in lua.
 Smelty: *thinks*
 Zenoscave: It's early enough to scrap a bot and not be behind
 Zenoscave: Learn from your errors and make a better ine
 Zenoscave: *one
 XeroOl: I've heard the word "beam search" in the chat earlier
 XeroOl: maybe I should make a beam search in lua
 Zenoscave: Probably a lot
 Zenoscave: Yeah that'll preform horribly
 Smelty: hmm
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: nice night memes
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Zenoscave: is it lua or luajit
 XeroOl: not luajit
 XeroOl: I wish
 Smelty: lol
 Zenoscave: Yeah beam search will fail you then
 XeroOl: it's lua 5.3
 XeroOl: If it were luajit I'd be goldent
 XeroOl: I know how to write luajit code well
 XeroOl: you just write it like you would write c code
 XeroOl: but with lua syntax
 XeroOl: maybe I should just use c++ lol
 Smelty: r i p
 XeroOl: I really really want to use a crappy language though

 XeroOl: lmao
 fvla: I almost started writing my bot in Python
 XeroOl: I have an if else bot right now
 XeroOl: not a beam search bot
 XeroOl: performance means nothing
 fvla: but then I had a stroke when I considered making a structure in Python
 fvla: so I switched to C++
 Smelty: landslide victory: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/Zv4hcD.jpg">https://snipboard.io/Zv4hcD.jpg</a>
 fvla: static typing ftw!
 XeroOl: ^
 XeroOl: good point
 XeroOl: maybe I'll switch to D
 eulerscheZahl: oh, chat works again on chromium
 XeroOl: I've heard that can have good performance lol
 Zenoscave: Until you're in day 7 and have so many f/else clauses you can't make changes and performance is too hard to squeeze out of it to add a beam search
 XeroOl: I've been on chromium the whole time
 XeroOl: did chat stop working?
 Zenoscave: moin eulerscheZahl
 fvla: How is F#? Anyone experienced?
 XeroOl: nope! I know its functional
 Zenoscave: ML derivative with .NET bindings
 XeroOl: oh right, F# is .NET
 Zenoscave: hence the #
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I dropped out of top 1000 over night :rofl:
 fvla: I see
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl shame
 eulerscheZahl: time to attack you Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: has that ever happened before?
 Zenoscave: PLEASE NO
 XeroOl: just add more ifs and elses
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 oddrationale: What I like about F# is that it is "functional-first". But you can fall back to OOP if/when needed.
 Zenoscave: I am enjoying top 10 and top 2 c#&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: also: relax, will take a bit to climb 1400 spots
 Zenoscave: Good time to write a sim
 XeroOl: I wish codingame added nim
 eulerscheZahl: and somehow I have a horrible smell in my rom
 ZarthaxX: toad has gases
 eulerscheZahl: as if a mouse died somewhere but I can't find one
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 XeroOl: nim is really good for writing messy code really quickly that magically is fast
 ZarthaxX: disgusting
 Zenoscave: Do you need batteries?
 eulerscheZahl: drives me nuts
 Zenoscave: wait not that kind of mouse
 eulerscheZahl: once my cat brought a mouse in which escaped below my bed to die there
 eulerscheZahl: but i checked that already
 eulerscheZahl: and looking behind the cupboards is more work
 XeroOl: smh there's no starter bot in D
 Zenoscave: do you have a mouse problem often euler?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: my cat got old now
 ZarthaxX: just clean the floor
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: you are not my mom
 ZarthaxX: it was just a suggestion
 ZarthaxX: :P
 XeroOl: ouch you can't encode a tree in 8 bits
 ZarthaxX: f
 Smelty: f
 eulerscheZahl: "Players gain an extra 1 point for every 3 sun points they have at the end of the game."
 eulerscheZahl: so: 2 suns = 0 points; 3 suns = 1 point?
 DaNinja: odd, my code gets reset to default every time I open the contest from the compete page
 DaNinja: changing languages restores it
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl shouldwork like that
 DaNinja: known bug?
 eulerscheZahl: can't find it in the referee
 Zenoscave: yes it works like that.
 Atatakakatta: going to make my code sliiiightly less greedy
 Zenoscave: bonusSCore
 Zenoscave: bonusScore *
 Atatakakatta: let's see how it goes~
 Atatakakatta: starting at 173
 eulerscheZahl: oh, there it is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/517645b1b41879f41a03d852abdf2cddb4be73b8/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L708">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/517645b1b41879f41a03d852abdf2cddb4be73b8/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L708</a>
 Zenoscave: What would you do for a beam search data structure? I always forget.
 eulerscheZahl: trees also give points?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/517645b1b41879f41a03d852abdf2cddb4be73b8/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L718-L719">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/517645b1b41879f41a03d852abdf2cddb4be73b8/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L718-L719</a>
 Smelty: hm
 eulerscheZahl: i just use hashsets and sort at the end of each layer
 Zenoscave: That's news to me
 eulerscheZahl: you could use a priority queue
 Zenoscave: the trees
 eulerscheZahl: but C# doesn't have one in the .net library
 ZarthaxX: data structure beam search?
 Zenoscave: I have to dig up that Fast Priority queue for c# again don't i
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, that tree part is the tie breaker if scores are the same otherwise
 Zenoscave: Oh yeah that sounds right
 eulerscheZahl: when the code i read is enclosed by an if, maybe i should read that as well
 eulerscheZahl: enough chatting, I have a leaderboard to climb
 ZarthaxX: gl&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: gl hf&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: but not too good of luck
 ZarthaxX: good lie? :P
 ZarthaxX: nvm
 Atatakakatta: almost top 100!
 Atatakakatta: I just need to teach my trees how to throw seeds longer
 Smelty: i am 107
 icecream17: oh yeah watch out for this submit
 Hjax: well i spent today messing around with bitboards and ended up largely unhappy with what i made
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: sad
 Hjax: i can represent the game fine, its just working with the game state thats obnoxious 
 Smelty: f
 icecream17: i beat!!!... someone who has the bronze boss as the profile picture
 Smelty: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: ah you will get around that Hjax&#160;:)
 Hjax: or ill scrap it 
 ZarthaxX: throw it?
 Hjax: maybe
 Hjax: so if youre bitboarding this game, you need different bitboards for each size tree
 ZarthaxX: if you are not enjoying contest you should
 Hjax: so iterating over your trees, to make planting decisions for instance 
 ZarthaxX: yup, makes sense
 Atatakakatta: oh boy, #72
 Hjax: is ugly 
 Atatakakatta: this is intense
 ZarthaxX: true true
 ZarthaxX: it  gets annoying
 Hjax: im just not sure of a better way to represent state if i want 
 Hjax: to be able to do a search later
 ZarthaxX: me neither, i would do bitboards
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Atatakakatta: #31
 Atatakakatta: this is probably my all-time peak
 Smelty: :0
 Atatakakatta: my code is so simple lol
 XeroOl: what is a bitboard? I've never heard that term
 Atatakakatta: you really don't need anything complex
 Smelty: me: #89 peak
 lainislain: halo, is there any chance the game could stop for some reason other than the 24 days rule of players error&#160;?
 Atatakakatta: no
 icecream17: most people in the top 100 arent searching i bet
 Atatakakatta: it either lasts 24 days or ends via timeout
 _Lupus_: @lainislain if players don't take their action in time
 lainislain: thanks
 Hjax: sure, but they will be in 11 days 
 XeroOl: I'm doing some searching right now
 Smelty: OMG BWAT SOMEONE WITH 177
 XeroOl: I'm rewriting all my code in a real language
 XeroOl: that isn't lua
 XeroOl: and I want to write a search
 XeroOl: but it's hard, because I don't know how much I should consider the enemy to be adversarial
 XeroOl: it's kind of weird
 XeroOl: this isn't the kind of problem that needs mcts
 XeroOl: at least I don't feel like it is
 icecream17: if youre opponent is me, then consider afversaryness to be 0
 Atatakakatta: like I said before, just optimization will probably get you into the top 1%
 Atatakakatta: to win? better start casting those shadows~
 XeroOl: yeah I already did if statements, and I'm done
 XeroOl: I don't want to think about if statements anymore
 zhenghaha: it's time for lunch
 icecream17: my code is a mess, wonder how future me will get search to work
 KCrown: it's day 1 by the time silver opens up again you'll need to be search 
 Smelty: oooof
 XeroOl: it's time to search now
 XeroOl: if you want to be ahead
 Atatakakatta: what do we mean by "search"? search for solutions?
 icecream17: ill probably get to silver though - im in the top 100
 XeroOl: do you want to be at the top of silver the moment it opens up?

 RGAM: Is there an option to always share your clash code automatically?
 Binary_Sky: I did find an option for that in the settings but it still asks me if i want to share but ive asked ather people and they said it automaticly shares mines
 FlyHead: has anyone ever experienced a test case being wrong? i mean, i know it sounds dumb, i usually blame myself for incorrectness...
 FlyHead: this time i figured it out... it's kind've a trick question... *falls on sword*
 AeQ: i don't understand why these bot programming challenges have a 'neural network' tag on them... how can we train a neural network if we have to depend on codingame to run the iterations for us?
 reCurse: There are quite a few neural network bots around
 jacek: and you train the neural network locally, offline. there is no data leaked for bots between games
 ramawijaya0466: test
 Menox: Is codingame loading slowly just for me or is it server sided?
 Menox: I checked speedtest and I have 226mbps download so it shouldn't be caused by my internet
 baguettes: 226 mbps?
 derjack: it works fine for meh
 Menox: yup 226
 Menox: megabits
 baguettes: Bits?
 baguettes: Lmao
 baguettes: I thought you meant btyes
 baguettes: bytes*
 baguettes: or you were serious
 Menox: yes bits 
 Menox: I'm from Slovakia so there's no change I have 220MB download lol
 Menox: *chance
 derjack: and net speed is usually shown in bits
 Menox: zeah
 Menox: yeah
 tutubalin: and one of the reason for that is that network byte is actually 10 bits
 Papaya_13: hello
 Papaya_13: hello world
 RustySconeOfWisdom_ea0e: hello

 Raph_Hax0r: CodingGame is being very slow for me&#160;:/
 BlaiseEbuth: Erf... Automaton2000 pedal faster&#160;!
 Automaton2000: well i wanted to do some easy puzzles
 BlaiseEbuth: You're the only one spending your work-time on codingame&#160;!
 BlaiseEbuth: Shame&#160;!
 Yasser: xD
 JLukeSkywalker: im spending work time here too
 JLukeSkywalker: its 'training'
 AntiSquid: tric
 AntiSquid: trictrac&#160;?
 Devil_Java: where are you from?
 BlaiseEbuth: My living room.
 BlaiseEbuth: For now.
 AntiSquid: there's a bug in your game @_@ trictrac
 BlaiseEbuth: Lel, classic
 AntiSquid: are you saying there isn't&#160;?
 KelvinAndHubbles: theres a bug in every game
 AntiSquid: he is not offline, how do i chase him down @_@
 Astrobytes: He's most likely working, so forum. Also he'll see the ping here when he's free.
 AntiSquid: this is urgent&#160;!
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream: call the lv3 desk immediately&#160;!
 AntiSquid: 5
 AntiSquid: level 5
 Astrobytes: Out of interest, what's the bug? Are you losing? :P (j/k)
 AntiSquid: bugs can cause one to lose when they shouldn't
 AntiSquid: didn't check if the bug alone would make a difference, but it's annoying
 darkhorse64: You got a new game before the current deck is exhausted and while there are errors remaining&#160;?
 AntiSquid: assumptions&#160;?
 darkhorse64: I believe that I have seen it once but it was very late and I did not kept the replay
 darkhorse64: keep
 AntiSquid: wouldn't be rank so high with that bug, not now not earlier
 AntiSquid: and talking about a different bug
 AntiSquid: but need to see what tric says
 jacek: who approved that ~
 BlaiseEbuth: Nobody approved your ~
 AntiSquid: one would say they exploit the bug if they weren't so low ranked, right Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: that's what i see in the morning
 Wontonimo: the sun never sets on Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i should probably start with a simple heuristic
 AntiSquid: or maybe i should exploit it? then it gets fixed sooner&#160;?
 darkhorse64: The westicles way&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes
 jacek: oh my
 AntiSquid: why is an approver still in wood2&#160;? i take offence 
 darkhorse64: double hulk in fireworks&#160;!!
 BlaiseEbuth: Exploiting bugs is an attempt to their dignity and fundamental rights.
 AntiSquid: it's freedom of expression and speech
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth will not answer and just directly check the reaching of the Godwin point. :ballot_box_with_check:</b>
 Wontonimo: bugs are just features that are misunderstood.  Use that feature for its full potential
 BlaiseEbuth: If you want to be rich, don't sell features. Sell bugs and the patchs.
 darkhorse64: Use the feature and get #1
 Astrobytes: *undocumented features
 AntiSquid: trying bug avoidance first
 BlaiseEbuth: HCF!
 AntiSquid: not very good, maybe bug exploit is best
 AntiSquid: maybe some of the top 3-4 already use it
 BlaiseEbuth: Poor poor bugs...&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: Not me or unconsciouly
 darkhorse64: unconsciously
 darkhorse64: hard to say, hard to type
 AntiSquid: it's ok, adding to my TODO list, still only half way done with this bot @_@
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 AntiSquid: it's that time when i need a rewrite and i simply say no
 darkhorse64: OO
 Andrew-H: oo

 deoignition: Php &gt;&gt;&gt; Html &gt;&gt;&gt; Python &gt;&gt;&gt; ASM &gt;&gt;&gt; Java &gt;&gt;&gt; JavaScript
 MSmits: hey darkhorse64 did you avx clobber already?
 MSmits: this seems to be my move generation, barring any possible bugs:
 MSmits: 	uint64_t rightMoves = (pB &lt;&lt; 1) &amp; oppB &amp; NOT_RIGHT_EDGE;	uint64_t leftMoves = (pB &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; oppB &amp; NOT_LEFT_EDGE;	uint64_t upMoves = (pB &lt;&lt; 8) &amp; oppB;	uint64_t downMoves = (pB &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; oppB;
 MSmits: bah wheres autopastebin when you need it
 darkhorse64: Only when counting the number of moves
 MSmits: seems so simple
 MSmits: barely worth doing avx for
 MSmits: why not, for random rollout, just do a rnd 0-3 and pick a direction
 darkhorse64: But it does not improve performance
 MSmits: then just generate for that direction
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do you shift emojis&#160;?
 MSmits: it's a pro tactic BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 MSmits: get a bit more experience and i will explain
 darkhorse64: In the end, all directions are not available
 MSmits: yes, but you can solve that by keeping a list of numbers 0-3 and just reduce that
 MSmits: until it hits one that works
 MSmits: i think i did that for bandas
 MSmits: not sure what for
 MSmits: in any case simd seems overkill here
 darkhorse64: for bandas, all moves are always valid
 MSmits: ohh right i remember now
 MSmits: it was oware
 MSmits: when i still had random rollout
 MSmits: some moves are invalid
 MSmits: because they dont leave moves for opponent
 MSmits: you dont know until you try
 MSmits: anyways, i dont think i will bother with avx here, unless i can later use it for some math stuff
 MSmits: the math stuff will go in expansion phase I think. You can prune some moves and solve some games early I think
 darkhorse64: rn, my clobber bot has a low sim count 26K. Move gen is slow. I translate my masks into start,end pairs
 MSmits: mmh why not do the movegeneration in 4 phases, then iterate over your move origin uint64_t  with _builtin_ctzl
 MSmits: you know the shift direction then
 MSmits: it's a constant within 1 phase
 MSmits: doing the right moves, it's all &lt;&lt; 1 so the move will be "origin bit + 1"
 MSmits: then for down moves it's &lt;&lt; 8 and bit index + 8
 MSmits: it might still be slow, especially early game because you'll be making 100+ children
 darkhorse64: Yes, you did that for bt. I have reused generic code where the MCTS does not know anything from the game
 MSmits: ah right i shared that. 
 MSmits: yeah you tend to use generic. I rewrite a lot for each bot, doing things differently each time
 MSmits: it has up and down sides
 darkhorse64: Sometimes abstraction really gets in your way but it allows for a quick'n dirty bot
 MSmits: yeah that it does
 MSmits: are you willing to dive into the math for this game?
 MSmits: I really think it will be the difference between top x and the players below that
 MSmits: it is in D&amp;B
 KelvinAndHubbles: is there a difference between Tron bot wood and bronze league? Thought the multiopponents was gonna be introduced, might just have to wait to leauge up
 MSmits: not sure when that happens KelvinAndHubbles
 darkhorse64: I should really write a boss for Clobber but I am stuck on Fireworks. For Clobber, the meta seems to count isolated islands, solve them with tables if possible. Tbh, I did the bot for happy few.
 MSmits: happy few?
 MSmits: is this a team i am not aware of
 MSmits: good teamname
 darkhorse64: You already are in the team
 MSmits: oo
 MSmits: The Happy Few
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: not sure you're happy enough jacek
 MSmits: but we'll take derjack
 darkhorse64: The guys really dedicated to searching
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Scarfield: did you find what you have been looking for then?
 MSmits: who has been looking for what?
 Scarfield: "dedicated to searching"
 darkhorse64: What matters in not finding but searching
 MSmits: yes, it's the journey, not the destination
 jacek: thats why we love cycles
 MSmits: hey jacek, did you get nr 1 at othello because of the randomness of your bot and old johns counterbooking?
 darkhorse64: Writing my second multi really taught all I have been doing wrong for the first, even the bot itself
 jacek: MSmits huh? i havent touched othello in some time
 jacek: also, clobber and endgames <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf">https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf</a>
 MSmits: I think old john counterbooked re curse and therefore pushed you to 1 
 MSmits: you're almost impossible to counterbook because of the random bot
 MSmits: well... it's doable, i did it but its not fun
 MSmits: yeah i have that paper
 darkhorse64: ^
 MSmits: it has a lot of useful information, but not easy to understand
 jacek: did you pay for it
 MSmits: just like the D&amp;B papers
 MSmits: no, i just did that once :P
 MSmits: and it was a crap paper
 jacek: in clobber you still can have not crappy generic mcts bot
 jacek: in d&amp;b its more like all or nothing
 MSmits: yes the math is more important in D&amp;B 
 MSmits: but thats because there are otherwise no features to eval
 MSmits: all the features come from the math
 MSmits: Clobber has some stuff you can eval
 MSmits: and it makes sense to random playout, it will converge to more favorable positions
 MSmits: this is because in clobber, you each have your own pieces
 MSmits: in D&amp;B there are just lines that dont belong to anyone
 jacek: like some other certain game :thinking:
 MSmits: :notepad_spiral: :soccer:
 MSmits: you still have a goal though
 MSmits: so it's a partisan game 
 MSmits: like clobber
 MSmits: D&amp;B is not partisan
 MSmits: there's nothing about the board that is different for either player. The only difference is whos turn it is and how many points each player has
 MSmits: and the points have no effect on what the best move is, you can use a scoreless state
 MSmits: so it's basically just... who's turn it is. That's all you can eval
 KelvinAndHubbles: Any tips when you're #1 only right behind the boss in a league? Just keep versing him and try to improve your code?
 MSmits: counter the boss specifically
 jacek: spam submit, exhaust him
 MSmits: if you get 50+% winrate
 MSmits: then spam submit
 MSmits: every player that beats you will get promoted 
 VIgoroth34: are there any programs that help people learn c# on here?
 MSmits: this site is mostly for practice
 jacek: woah, chessfield advanced to league
 MSmits: it gives you incentive to google stuff
 KelvinAndHubbles: fair enough, me fighting him is pretty 50 50 with the boss
 MSmits: make it a little better
 MSmits: and you're golden
 VIgoroth34: alright thank you 
 MSmits: also there might be a p1 advantage
 MSmits: so if you're 50-50 as p1, you might be 40-60 as p2
 MSmits: then you're actually weaker
 MSmits: if you get 50% WR as p1 in uttt, you're actually much weaker4
 Scarfield: "woah" a little too surprised i think :p
 MSmits: maybe it was a sarcastic woah
 MSmits: jacek does a lot of sarcasm, so take it as a compliment
 jacek: do I?
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: don't you?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: MSmits, nice idea with the direction picking in clobber
 MSmits: maybe I need to review all your messages and reprocess them
 Scarfield: but i insist on being offended:smiling_imp:
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: UnnamedCodinGamer cool, i will need to finish a bot and try it out myself
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I was wondering how to optmize that
 MSmits: well the most expensive part there, is the expansion phase itself, creating all the child nodes
 jacek: i always generate via loop from square
 MSmits: what do you mean from square?
 Scarfield: have you improved you chess jachess? not checking if king in check every move and so on?
 shubh-assasinzzz: how to be king in python
 jacek: MSmits while (board) index = ctz(board) then xor
 Scarfield: not king boa?
 MSmits: ah yes, thats what i do, but for clobber i would do this 4 times
 MSmits: 1 for each dir
 MSmits: to be python king, one must study tiger king
 jacek: Scarfield yeah, made some lookup tables. and also, my isOver() function was expensive because first i generated list of all legal moves and then checked if the list is empty
 Scarfield: lol "Boa constrictor" is "king boa" directly translated from my lang
 MSmits: :tiger: :crown:
 MSmits: jacek, fastest would be to do create the 4x uint64_t origin boards and then or them together like a | b | c  |  d and then check == 0&#160;?
 jacek: im talking chess
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: for clobber i do origin board 4fill
 jacek: and check with opponents
 jacek: &amp;
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: it's really one of the easiest games i've seen to do move generation and move application
 MSmits: dont think any other is easier
 Scarfield: kewl, messed some more with my eval today and ranked up with just 1 ply eval, so it works fairly well i suppose. Next up is minmax and a number of improvements i havent tried before&#160;:)
 jacek: not even 2 ply search?
 jacek: MSmits amazons are also easy
 Scarfield: not yet, was playing around with my eval
 MSmits: with amazons you need to shoot... you get thousands of moves
 MSmits: seems more complicated
 MSmits: uttt is easier
 jacek: well there are many moves, but bitboarding is easy
 MSmits: sure thats true
 MSmits: bandas/oware are hard
 Scarfield: its likely way too expensive when i start to search, but thats a future problem for future me
 MSmits: I am too afraid to try chess
 MSmits: seems hard
 jacek: many edge cases, and castling
 MSmits: yeah
 kovi: im also afraid to start it
 Scarfield: its already the longest "bot" i have written, and no search yet xD
 MSmits: the complexity is ridiculous compared to the other board games
 kovi: and the knowledgebase
 MSmits: checkers already feels much more complex than the other ones, but this is exponentially harder
 Scarfield: yea, but its easier to see if your bot is playing well or not
 MSmits: true
 jacek: im very meh at chess
 Scarfield: to some extent of course, my chess game is not exactly GM lvl
 MSmits: I'm mediocre. Can do a solid 1400 I think 
 MSmits: if i had more opening knowledge i could probably get higher
 jacek: mhm
 Scarfield: just london all the way
 MSmits: when i play chess however... i keep thinking, why am I playing this game? I should code a bot for it
 MSmits: the fact that it requires you to memorize openings is even worse, as i have 5 meta mcts running in the background while playing chess :P
 jacek: good luck with meta for chess960
 Scarfield: the fischer random part is great, im not sure i would have tried if it was normal chess
 MSmits: yeah thankfully meta is not an option
 MSmits: well it would actually be possible if not for codesize limits
 kovi: not exact moves, but still opening strat
 MSmits: also exact moves, it's just a matter of calculation time and storage
 MSmits: but it wont fit in CG limits
 kovi: fortunately
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: also the game is much harder to write a bot for, meta mcts is not an i-win button. Without a strong bot, your meta mcts will suck
 jacek: without good ending, bot sucks
 jacek: just goes around
 MSmits: ah yeah. Worse than checkers?
 jacek: too soon to say
 MSmits: you could for sure add a rook-king mate algorithm
 jacek: not my bot but i had games when i had bare kings and other got 7 pieces and he couldnt checkmate
 MSmits: some mate algos are easy
 MSmits: but there's so many combinations that you would need a lot of code
 Kellthazar: Hello, Im trying to code a simulator for the mars3 puzzle problem, but it's seems that my physics "engine" does not match with the CG's one.
 Kellthazar: Initial position: X=6500m, Y=2600m
 MSmits: someone have the referee for it?
 Kellthazar: After applying the "15 3" command (15 degree angle, and power of 3), the coding game new position for the shuttle is x: 6480, y: 2599
 MSmits: you might have the order wrong
 Scarfield: the acceleration for mars lander is applied continuously, not by just adding the acc vector
 Kellthazar: On my simulation is {"x":6480,"y":2597}
 MSmits: changing the angle, applying the force etd.
 Kellthazar: Hmmm
 MSmits: what does that mean Scarfield?
 MSmits: continuously/
 MSmits: (in this context)
 jacek: youre physician and you dont know
 MSmits: thats why i added that last line :p
 MSmits: I knew you were here
 MSmits: i'm also not a physician
 jacek: he doesnt answer. he may be too discreet
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Smits MD
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 Kellthazar: So, on my algo,  I applied the gravity force to the velocity vector.
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: after i added the thrust vector
 MSmits: try different orders, see if one of them matches
 Kellthazar: Hmmm.. I will do that, thanks&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: p = 0.5 (v+previous_v)
 MSmits: there's usually a referee available
 MSmits: not in this case i guess
 darkhorse64: Sorry p += 0.5*(v+previous_v)
 Kellthazar: why 0.5?
 MSmits: you never said what p is, so it was fine
 MSmits: average
 MSmits: because i guess that is what Scarfield meant by continous
 Kellthazar: v is the velocity?
 darkhorse64: p = position, v = speed, all are floats
 Scarfield: yes
 Kellthazar: oh
 Scarfield: i thought you were joking smitsi
 MSmits: no, it just didnt fit my definition of continuous
 MSmits: but i see what you mean
 Scarfield: isnt that the word for it, as opposed to be discrete
 MSmits: i think it's still discrete, but you make a first order correction to the error you get by working with discrete values
 MSmits: by taking the average
 Astrobytes: Seems legit, yep
 darkhorse64: This is my code and it matches exactly ML
 MSmits: yeah, thats probably the exact sim they use
 MSmits: there's various ways to do this and different physics engines use different methods
 darkhorse64: I think I got the relevant information from the forum
 MSmits: allright back to clobber. Want to try and finish something today
 Astrobytes: Oh you're doing Clobber, good man.
 Astrobytes: Doesn't take long to get up and running with it.
 Scarfield: no more uttt?
 MSmits: doing a long running book experiment with uttt. 
 Astrobytes: til the next brainwave TicTacToeField
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm in between waves
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: UltiBytes
 Astrobytes: heh
 Scarfield: figured it out Kellthazar?
 Kellthazar: @Scarfield I was afk, I'll try to change now.
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b4f65a45-9ac6-45b1-b758-48a9b312f562">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b4f65a45-9ac6-45b1-b758-48a9b312f562</a>
 Scarfield: this is the code i used boiled down, might be more obvious&#160;:)
 RGAM: Is there a way to auto share your clash automatically?
 MSmits: your solution you mean?
 MSmits: I think there might be, but not sure
 Scarfield: you can toggle autoshare CoC solutions somewhere in your profile settings
 Scarfield: "Auto publish solutions" in your settings
 Scarfield: cleaned my pc ealier and found a part sitting a little loose. blissfull silence&#160;:)
 RGAM: Scarfield, I did that yesterday, but it still appears the "share code" button.
 RGAM: OMG Scarfield! What was this part?
 Scarfield: hm no idea then, i havnt clashed in years. 
 Scarfield: just some empty holder, nothing that shouldnt be loose
 NiKala: hi
 Scarfield: hey
 NiKala: can i join in two in two clashes at same time?
 Scarfield: no idea, but why would you not just do one after the other? 
 NiKala: i need to wait if i finished one early 
 NiKala: )
 NiKala: )&#160;;
 jacek: no
 jacek: you can join new clash immediately
 NiKala: wow thanks
 Kellthazar: Hmmm... I tried the solution proposed by darkhorse64, it's seems more accurate, but still diverge "through" the time.
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc687a44-3e7a-4b55-af03-2d030b3dbc27">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc687a44-3e7a-4b55-af03-2d030b3dbc27</a>
 darkhorse64: Do you apply any truncation to your data&#160;?
 Kellthazar: Im using p5js to visualize my solution, so I adjust the coords to print on the canvas, but without change the "original" data, where all the calculation occurs. I'will review all my code to see if there any missing  truncation.
 Kellthazar: Anyway, thanks for the attention&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: trictrac Automaton2000 AutomatonNN&#160;? anyone home&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you are getting close to top 3
 AutomatonNN: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 AntiSquid: i was 2nd&#160;!!! Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: there's a bunch of stuff
 jacek: 2nd? where?
 jacek: AutomatonNN is on fire
 AntiSquid: fireworks
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a lot of people so far off the contest in the contest, I am stil
 jacek: :cry:
 AntiSquid: depends who submits basically
 AntiSquid: one night of 2nd
 AntiSquid: it's ok still have plenty ideas to improve, but doing it on and off
 jacek: exploiting bugs eh
 AntiSquid: not yet!
 AntiSquid: and it's just 1 bug i found
 AntiSquid: those i am not aware of don't count
 Closetron: hello world!
 Tuo: do any of you veterans have tips on version control of files or something for CG? one huge file gets tedious handle and spring challenge is coming&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: winter is coming
 Tuo: winter is here! of w8 its gone
 Tuo: *oh
 AntiSquid: always next winter to look forward to
 AntiSquid: unless we enter a new ice age i guess
 trictrac: AntiSquid a question&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ya wait i pm better
 therealbeef: Tuo you can use multiple files and have a file save hook that cats them together and automatic sync to the IDE
 Tuo: how could i do this?
 jacek: cats :3
 therealbeef: which part of it?
 Tuo: eh all of it
 therealbeef: Most IDEs have plugins that let you automatically run a script when you save a file
 therealbeef: such a script could concatenate several files into one
 therealbeef: there is a browser plugin for CG that syncs a chosen file to the web IDE
 therealbeef: if all of that is unfamiliar, i'd start with that sync tool. there's documentation on CG about it
 Tuo: ok ty. i will try to get something together
 Astrobytes: And scripts for merging files too for a few langs. C++, Java, C# and python, perhaps JS
 Astrobytes: On the forum if you search&#160;;)
 therealbeef: wouldn't 'cat' work for any language?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but you have aspects of different languages that could be problematic
 Astrobytes: just cating a bunch of c++ h and cpp files together isn't generally going to go too wel, for example
 Astrobytes: *well
 Astrobytes: that's why there's a bunch of different scripts catering to different languages (sorry for delay, was afk)
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-fireworks/189112/13">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-fireworks/189112/13</a> input required hope people vote in favour of making fuses more useful
 AntiSquid: trictrac posted it
 Astrobytes: fuses == allowed errors?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: Gotcha, will take a look tomorrow
 jacek: for what should i vote for?
 Astrobytes: Well, I'll look now but properly look tomorrow I mean.
 AntiSquid: vote Bernie 2020 jacek
 trictrac: thanks AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: vote for errors to not deduct points jacek
 AntiSquid: lol he actually posted it 
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's a fair point AntiSquid and trictrac
 jacek: AntiSquid edited
 Astrobytes: Not sure about using 3rd fuse, it's not fatal in the real game right?
 AntiSquid: 3rd fuse ends the game
 Astrobytes: I reference your point that "But then late game on last round it’s still worth some times to take the risk even on 3rd error"
 AntiSquid: but even that is a good play if it's last round ... you risk guessing correct card why not, more points
 Astrobytes: Right, cool, gotcha
 Astrobytes: Is it worth creating a private contribution (or public, whatever) to test it?
 AntiSquid: trictrac's worry is the leagues, he said bad bots get promoted if the rules are too lenient
 Astrobytes: Yes, this is true
 Tuo: My bot makes risky plays even with penalty
 Tuo: you just need to know when its worth it&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you don't normally get punished for it and here it's added to promote better teamplay
 AntiSquid: if you're against my suggestion mention it in forums or the creator ...
 Tuo: i think its a nice mechanic that nobody just uses
 Tuo: i shall!
 AntiSquid: taking risks or screwing teammates over?
 Tuo: taking risks
 Astrobytes: It's an interesting point tbh. My gut is to go with your suggestion AntiSquid but it would have to be in the top league only I think...
 AntiSquid: ya asked tric if he wants to open new league :P
 AntiSquid: top 5-10 :P
 AntiSquid: won't submit till then obviously
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's an option for sure. I still think it should be tested before going live though.
 jacek: yeah who approves games without testing :unamused:
 Astrobytes: You know AntiSquid, there is a reason that we try to thoroughly test games in the WIP/approval stage that we're interested in :P
 Astrobytes: jacek knows nothing about this at all
 Astrobytes: Fake news
 jacek: about what
 AntiSquid: wasn't here or probably too busy
 Astrobytes: Exactly
 Tuo: the penalty might be too high. my bot only makes 1-3 risky plays per set
 Tuo: and it think its pretty close optimal
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid it was in WIP/approval for 3+ months :D
 AntiSquid: the penalty of 1 point has big impact on where you rank at the end of the game, the entire team for the round gets same score except for your -1
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it seems odd to punish for that
 AntiSquid: kovi is 0-0-0 penalty wrong? like in the real game?
 Astrobytes: Kovi's suggestion is better. 2 might be too much though
 AntiSquid: you can test Astrobytes but you might not like the final decision anyway :P
 kovi: i don't know the original game
 AntiSquid: hanabi is the original game
 AntiSquid: well fireworks translated
 AntiSquid: you have <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cardboardrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hanabi-fuses.jpg">https://www.cardboardrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hanabi-fuses.jpg</a>
 AntiSquid: and bomb goes off if you make too many mistakes :P
 AntiSquid: it's more dramatic with those tiles
 Tuo: the my card expected value vs someone elses for using free error mechanic would be interesting
 Astrobytes: Hm. Perhaps a Mars Lander sound should have triggered upon the fuse running out :thinking: :P
 AntiSquid: :100:
 Tuo: as in if i should use the free possible error
 kovi: yes, the meta would be even if its not riskly, let other take it with better chance
 Astrobytes: FFS this is the conversation we needed in WIP!
 AntiSquid: kovi you take the risk of playing a card that might be worth 5 points, if you're wrong you get punished, sure there are situations where it's a bad play and situations where the risk is much appreciated and actually best play
 jacek: no time, push it to production on friday night!
 Astrobytes: trictrac: how long did you wait for approval?
 trictrac: 2 months
 Astrobytes: Oh I thought it was 3, my mistake.
 Tuo: u need to consider win propability not just card value&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: honestly i am more motivated to try a game when it's live, i still didn't start chess and the circle game ashketchup posted
 jacek: circle game?
 AntiSquid: connect 4
 Astrobytes: trictrac: you can see clearly here the issues with the approval procedure on CG sometimes&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: oh and didn't start triangle one either
 jacek: connect triangle?
 Astrobytes: connect worlds
 jacek: :crying_cat_face:
 trictrac: The problem is that we are not enough to test
 trictrac: I try to make all multi
 AntiSquid: Tuo it's last round we have no 5s left, would you be upset if a player played any card 1/5 chance hitting the 5&#160;?
 trictrac: but is hard work
 AntiSquid: wait i mean we have 1 5 left
 Astrobytes: Yes, there should be some way of showing users that x or y multi/puzzle is awaiting approval or testing.
 Tuo: well with current rules hes just not that smart&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: multis can always be updated, no biggie, people might be busy can always upgrade visuals and everything
 Tuo: w8 last round player proply should know if the card is a 5
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes i didn't test this connect 4 version but it might be solvable&#160;!! ... just like the other variants out there
 AntiSquid: ya they should, but even if not, it's last round&#160;?!
 trictrac: Make a proposal for a multi, is an investment. So the community need to answer as fast as possible to this proposal
 Astrobytes: Don't think it is AntiSquid, but ask MSmits, he ran meta MCTS on it for some time, he has the stats
 Tuo: last round you cant have a 1/5 change of having a 5&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: well lower, but still not always 100% sure
 AntiSquid: you might not always get the hints you need
 AntiSquid: you could have the 1/5 chance if nobody hinted anything since all the plays were in the other hands
 Astrobytes: trictrac: It's very difficult for people to find the multis in the swamp that is the Contribution section currently. We have suggested to separate them all into clashes/puzzles/multis/solo/optim but ...
 trictrac: you have right, it's hard to find them&#160;!!
 AntiSquid: ya not to mention people with allergy to coc won't even look there, they might get placed on ventilators otherwise
 Astrobytes: I think the only way is to repeatedly talk about it and ask for feedback in chat (discreetly of course)
 Tuo: y actually in theory its possible. the points dont realy matter what matters is what results in interisting bot gameplay
 Tuo: kovi s suggestion is good. having 3 errors might meke tahe game easier
 AntiSquid: i agree with you tuo, well in that regard this is a good game because it promotes more "intuitive" algorithms, so what rules help meet that goal&#160;?
 Tuo: problem with easier is that there is a LOT of luck involved so differences in bots are hard to see
 trictrac: So the consensus is&#160;?
 MSmits: AntiSquid connect4 is definitely solvable, but it just hasn't been done yet afaik. 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 MSmits: we have 9x7
 MSmits: so just out of reach for the person on that website
 AntiSquid: i don't know about this version, the 7 columns one on gameboardsarena is solved, which is funny
 AntiSquid: red always wins
 MSmits: yes but 7 columns is wayyyyy easier than 9
 AntiSquid: i am guessing a similar strategy will be good
 Tuo: i vore for 0,1,2. its keeps the evaluating how good a risky play is in game but allows for more strategies
 Astrobytes: trictrac: I'm not going to comment with any weight as my bot is not currently in the arena, but whatever changes are made should not be in the bottom league for sure
 AntiSquid: is this version also best to first play middle column MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: no, sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2608a7e5-1acd-4856-b371-4758d9b0b45c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2608a7e5-1acd-4856-b371-4758d9b0b45c</a>
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, I told you he literally has the stats :D
 MSmits: 4 is middle
 MSmits: 5,6,7,8 not included due to symmetry
 jacek: you need to pump those numbers up
 MSmits: the game has steal, so the advantage doesnt matter
 MSmits: 1 is best start so far
 AntiSquid: but you don't have the solved stats MSmits
 Astrobytes: No one said he solved it
 jacek: yet
 MSmits: no, but it's getting clearer every day. I should eventually solve it
 MSmits: not sure if it will take months or years though
 MSmits: i dont run the most efficient setup here
 Astrobytes: We're here for the long haul anyway right :P
 Astrobytes: What! You just upgraded you fool :D
 MSmits: basically, a "visit" is a game played, it's usually solved at depth 30-40 or so
 MSmits: many nodes go near that depth alreadty
 AntiSquid: MSmits your chart says #3 is best start
 MSmits: yeah i did upgrade, bu it's just using 1 core
 MSmits: yes, but the game has steal optin
 MSmits: option
 jacek: AntiSquid without a steal
 MSmits: so if someone plays 3, it's gonna get stolen
 Astrobytes: Fix your core usage MSmits!
 AntiSquid: it's not regular connect 4&#160;?
 MSmits: i am also running 4 other games, i like it this way&#160;:)
 trictrac: Tuo, AntiSquid &amp; Kovi, If I install&#160;: 0,-1,-2 I need to remove the 0 point rule for the third mistake
 Tuo:&#160;?
 MSmits: AntiSquid yes it is regular connect 4
 MSmits: do you know the pie rule?
 MSmits: if you played yavalath you know
 AntiSquid: he means if he adds the penalty as 0 -1 -2 then the 3rd mistakes won't set your score to 0 anymore
 kovi: 0 point rule just meant 2 mistakes.none risks 3rd
 AntiSquid: at least we get 0 penalty for first try
 MSmits: AntiSquid basically it's like this. Player 1 does a move. Player 2 gets to choose to flip colors or not.  If he flips colors, he becomes player 1 basically
 MSmits: so player 1 is forced to play a balanced move
 AntiSquid: pie rule MSmits&#160;? there's no such rule on gameboardarena and i don't know about the version implemented on CG
 AntiSquid: there's also a version where you can rotate the board afaik so ...
 MSmits: it's just a general balancing rule used in many games that have unbalanced starts
 MSmits: it's not connect4 specific
 Astrobytes: Ist 2 to harsh? Or it's balanced enough to work with that (assuming a positive outcome for the risk)?
 Astrobytes: *Is not ist, I'm turning German!
 MSmits: if you dont use pie-rule in yavalath, the entire game is solved as a win for p1 for example. Easily solved even
 MSmits: (takes about an hour)
 AntiSquid: astro the current version sets your points to 0, which is harsher :P
 Tuo: -2 should mean that u dont play ever
 AntiSquid: on 3rd mistake
 Tuo: well pretty close
 Astrobytes: Hm, yes. OK.
 jacek: pinkie pie rule?
 Tuo: need to be 85+% sure that a good card goes
 MSmits: our version of connect 4 is actually harder to solve because of pie rule... I need to solve every starting move to solve the entire game
 AntiSquid: MSmits ok i understand the idea, but no i didn't encounter this in online board games
 MSmits: I read about it being discussed for a connect4 tourney
 jacek: not even hex?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/295726/any-suggestions-making-connect-four-suitable-tourn">https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/295726/any-suggestions-making-connect-four-suitable-tourn</a>
 AntiSquid: so currently you can wreck the ladder on gameboardarena with a solver
 MSmits: they discuss it here as one of the options
 AntiSquid: maybe it's an option when you host a game
 MSmits: yeah but whats the point, you can do the same in chess with an engine
 MSmits: or any boardgame
 MSmits: you dont need to solve it to beat human players
 MSmits: if we play uttt together online, i can just run a bot to give me moves
 AntiSquid: well my initial question was regarding the CG version
 MSmits: it's just a form of cheating is all
 MSmits: in a friendly competition environment people wont do it. On a massive free for all website of course they will
 AntiSquid: you were talking about the pie rule, i don't see it there, i see how it can be useful though
 MSmits: oh ok yes
 MSmits: it's an easy fix for imbalance
 MSmits: however, it does need the existence of at least 1 balanced move
 MSmits: it would make uttt a lot better too i think
 AntiSquid: even without a bot, you will eventually memorize the meta
 Tuo: trictracc 4th mistake is the 0 points one right?
 MSmits: well part of it at least yeah. I think connect 4 is simple enough that the game will get boring for experts fairly quickly
 AntiSquid: just look up any chess grandmaster explaining and naming any opening and opening variation, every tiny move seems to have it's own name, it's crazy
 MSmits: I know, i watched some YT channels for a few weeks
 MSmits: chess channels
 MSmits: agadmator&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: now i have to check if magnus is still world champ
 MSmits: think so
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: in regular chess anyway
 MSmits: not speed i think
 MSmits: there's 1 better
 AntiSquid: 2013 until present
 jacek: meth chess?
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: they're all dosed up and then they play
 trictrac: Tuo yes it's the 4 you have right
 trictrac: and I keep this rule
 Astrobytes: cheth jacek
 Astrobytes: MSmits: where is your Clobber bot
 MSmits: still working on move generation
 jacek: ezpz
 MSmits: ye i got some bug
 Astrobytes: It's not that bloody hard
 MSmits: it counts them right, it's 104 at start right?
 Astrobytes: 112
 jacek: 112
 MSmits: meh, then it doesnt count them right either :p
 Astrobytes: check for a shift operator roudn the wrong way. I totally did that
 Astrobytes: *round
 MSmits: probably
 jacek: or wall masks
 MSmits: got those
 MSmits: but they might have bugs
 Astrobytes: Yeah, check if they're roudn the right way though! 
 MSmits: btw, i was just afk for 2 hrs, so i basically have 1 hr into this bot, gimme some time&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: darkhorse64, I think that I fixed my code thanks to your tip. :D
 Astrobytes: Excuses, excuses :D
 MSmits: but they're not even round
 MSmits: are you sure you werent shifting with parentheses?
 AntiSquid: there are 4 fuses, but the 4th tile shows you the explosion trictrac
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AntiSquid: still better than having 0 points for using 3rd error i guess
 AntiSquid: Once you hit error 3, you lose. In the real game. But sure whatever, let's have a 4th. :P
 AntiSquid: MSmits is that your best bot version on connect 4? just curious to check the current meta
 MSmits: well it has a book based off 1.5 M visits and i currently have over 2.0M. But even without book it should be the best bot.
 MSmits: it took me half a day to code more or less
 Astrobytes: Don't be so naive, 'best bot' hasn't been created yet, it's always a few weeks in the future :P
 MSmits: yes, i mean live bot&#160;:)
 MSmits: if you want to know the meta AntiSquid
 MSmits: it's mcts with rollouts
 MSmits: no early termination and eval, just rollouts, like uttt
 MSmits: but they're a little smarter, my bot doesnt give away wins on next turn
 jacek: mine is jacekmax + n-tuples
 Astrobytes: And - don't  forget to connect 4
 MSmits: my bot never connects 4  in rollouts
 jacek: should make more memes for connect4
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/531327807">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/531327807</a> this is still played a little bit like in the 7 col variant, you start on 1 but then you both build up on mid row
 jacek: i believe in high level play its a stackfest in the beginning
 Astrobytes: well you saw the stats
 AntiSquid: maybe it's because of the pie rule&#160;?
 MSmits: goes off book on frame 0
 MSmits: 10
 MSmits: so everything before that is scripted (my first 5 moves)
 MSmits: yeah pie rule might have that effect
 MSmits: i'll show principal variation for mid game start, sec
 MSmits: mid col
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83b29d32-8cc3-432a-9733-6ace31962012">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83b29d32-8cc3-432a-9733-6ace31962012</a>
 AntiSquid: i bet it's still be something like mid col: red-&gt;blue-&gt;red-&gt;blue all the way to the top up until there's one slot left open, then it branches out a lot, even for this variant
 MSmits: I think 3 start has something like that
 MSmits: oh this was 3
 MSmits: mid col is weird
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6dc445f3-d053-46e5-abcf-bdbfd43b3392">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6dc445f3-d053-46e5-abcf-bdbfd43b3392</a>
 MSmits: for the full info:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7240eb31-f311-445a-a86c-c782f8129490">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7240eb31-f311-445a-a86c-c782f8129490</a>
 MSmits: see how most moves are solved already?
 AntiSquid: ok and after that part i be it builds up around the edges and tries to trap you with some fancy diagonals
 AntiSquid: i bet *
 MSmits: maybe, i did not dive too far into the tactics
 MSmits: personally, I am just interested in seeing if i can solve this thing
 AntiSquid: i looked a bit at theory too
 MSmits: is this size specific?
 MSmits: or more general?
 AntiSquid: no idea how much it applies to this version when solved, but mid col start is red win and the tiles next to mid are draws so i am surprised you start with index 1
 MSmits: if you look here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 MSmits: the smaller sizes have draws as overall wins
 MSmits: then they disappear for larger sizes
 MSmits: as overall results i mean
 MSmits: so basically, if we had 7x6 here with steal, it would be solved as a draw
 MSmits: because people would open with next-to-mid
 MSmits: draws seem to be super rare with 9x7
 MSmits: might be that all starting moves go one way or the other, but from meta mcts, winrate seems pretty close to 50% for move 1
 AntiSquid: that guy doesn't show any results for 9x7
 MSmits: no which is why the size was upped to 9x7 in contribution
 MSmits: to not make it too easy to solve
 AntiSquid: amazing, it had good approvers :P
 MSmits: yeah we took it seriously&#160;:)
 MSmits: first time i approved anything
 Astrobytes: And that was up for a whiiiiile
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: the guy really wanted to make it good
 MSmits: he spent time writing a bot too 
 Astrobytes: Waiting on Ash doing his boss for the most part in the end I think. And yeah, he really listended
 AntiSquid: i completely missed the connect 4 WIP phase, didn't notice it before it published
 Astrobytes: *listened
 MSmits: btw, i don't think it's going to be the most interesting game and eventually there will be perfect playing bots on there, but thats ok with me, we should have a connect4 game as it's a classic
 MSmits: plenty of other games for the die hard competition
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I don't mind solved games or whatever, even really really easy ones for practice, just wish there was a category for basic/practice multis.
 MSmits: yeah that would be better
 jacek: if you dont care about rank, you can always experiment with different approach for the game and see how far it can go
 Astrobytes: Good for testing algorithms, optimisations thereof, bitboarding  etc
 AntiSquid: MSmits i am looking at the pattern on the site you linkedthere's + for odd number of rows, i am guessing 1st player at advantage without pie rule! :P
 MSmits: yeah, like Patrick with his php bots&#160;:)
 MSmits: AntiSquid thats very likely from looking at my results
 Astrobytes: hehe yeah, I really wish he would use C though, Patrick would be a beast
 MSmits: I dont doubt it
 MSmits: i think he filled his entire codesize with lookups for his uttt php bot 
 MSmits: dedication
 Astrobytes: jacek: yeah, hence our alt accounts
 jacek: your alt accounts*
 Astrobytes: jacek: I have only one, you have only one as far as I am aware
 MSmits: I have one too now, CG made me create it because my account went dead
 AntiSquid: i thought we don't talk about those because they're not allowed? pretend they are the evil step brother of the neighbour playing from your basement or something
 MSmits: it's just uttt bronze
 Astrobytes: ah innoble
 MSmits: ye
 Astrobytes: Mines states it does not compete in the description, and says it's my testing account
 MSmits: I should add a description too
 MSmits: but it's not going to go beyond bronze anywhere anyway
 MSmits: I guess for community things thats diffeent with the wood leagues
 MSmits: mmh
 AntiSquid: description&#160;: "i made this account to gave troll hints in co-op games to force a fix"
 AntiSquid: give *
 Astrobytes: It can go anywhere MSmits. Just deactivate it when it's not in use (submit broken code)
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: I'll try to just not submit if it isnt necessary
 MSmits: some games have just 1 league
 Astrobytes: My alt's in CSB legend somewhere in the trough of negative scores at the bottom
 MSmits: ah the mariana junkyard
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek:&#160;?
 MSmits: ohh i was shifting the wrong way
 MSmits: i was shifting my board to the opponent board to see which of my pieces could move
 Astrobytes: I TOLD YOU
 MSmits: ahh is that what you meant, i just checked if my &lt; weren't (
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: FFS :D
 MSmits: I just get overconfident, i type up the whole thing at once thinking i would never make a mistake
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, I spent a good 2 hours on the same issue
 MSmits: I often type like 200-300 lines of code and then test :P
 Astrobytes: That's what I did
 MSmits: makes sense then
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS submitting in CSB again?
 Astrobytes: Wonder what the change was, where was he before?
 MSmits: around 6-7
 MSmits: yay seems to count to 112 now
 Astrobytes: Looks like he'll end up 5th or 6th now, seems to be between him and IGGY mostly
 MSmits: is iggy a nn?
 Astrobytes: gj MSmits
 Astrobytes: I don't even know tbh 
 Astrobytes: I don't *think* so but I am free to be corrected.
 MSmits: next test is to pick a random child and play that move
 MSmits: see if it crashes sometimes
 MSmits: if it never does, my sim is probably good
 Astrobytes: You don't have to state the obvious here, you're in enlightened company
 MSmits: true true
 MSmits: mostly thinking aloud
 MSmits: or a-type, 
 Astrobytes: Yeah no shit :D
 MSmits: no jobby indeed
 Astrobytes: Hah!
 AntiSquid: very enlightened considering Automaton2000 can double for a flash light
 Automaton2000: thought it was a nice one
 MSmits: Automaton2000 you're the light of our day
 Automaton2000: i guess that would work
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: researching clobber is gonna be weird
 Astrobytes: Automaton2000: I ping you rarely, say something reasonable.
 Automaton2000: why do you need to be very good
 Astrobytes: Cool. I'm satiated.
 MSmits: games end at ply 44 or something, solves will happen probably in the early 30s
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I haven't dug very far into any literature yet tbh
 MSmits: no, i am just going by the endgame branching
 Astrobytes: ah right
 MSmits: its early game will be super random-like, with huge branching
 MSmits: but then it's decided quickly after that
 Astrobytes: Yes, solves happen in the 30s
 MSmits: I hope a plain mcts is good enough that a meta mcts can do some worthwhile research. If the bot is weak then the research is useless
 Astrobytes: I think plain MCTS can do something with time yes
 MSmits: ok will try that then, because to go beyond plain mcts will be hard with this math stuff. 
 Astrobytes: afaik jaceks current one is just vanilla mcts
 Astrobytes: but not optimised
 MSmits: isnt darkhorse64's also?
 MSmits: or does he do something else?
 Astrobytes: Yes but I think his is more optimised
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer also - just highly optimised vanilla MCTS?
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: trictrac and myself are alphabeta
 Astrobytes: (well, I believe so)
 MSmits: the meta in olympiad scene seems to be ab so far
 MSmits: from what i read
 Astrobytes: that's 10x10
 MSmits: oh right, that matters
 MSmits: with more depth it's harder to do anything with random rollouts
 Astrobytes: Well, no-one said vanilla was the way to go
 Astrobytes: Multiple approaches in this game, that's why it's in so many papers
 MSmits: are there really so many?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: mine is vanilla mcts, not very optimized - around 10000 iterations on second move
 MSmits: how come you beat darkhors ethen? Or is this just random submit luck?
 Astrobytes: Not specifically *on* Clobber MSmits - it's used in algortithm papers as a test game
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think it is luck
 MSmits: with so few games, thats possible
 MSmits: ah ok Astrobytes
 darkhorse64: mcts + solver. Not very optimized
 UnnamedCodinGamer: although I beat him in the IDE from time to time
 MSmits: you still have 26k vs UnnamedCodinGamer's 10k
 Astrobytes: I beat you both in the IDE from time to time currently
 MSmits: well i beat the boss from time to time
 Astrobytes: Not good enough to submit yet though
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, I have good record against trictrac 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but this is eyeballing
 UnnamedCodinGamer: we need more games
 Astrobytes: I beat trictrac in the IDE 100%  currently only under very specific conditions, not a good metric right now
 Astrobytes: Yes, more games.
 AntiSquid: clobber reminds me of dots and boxes to some degree
 AntiSquid: count how many turns are left
 MSmits: mathematical it's the same type of game, uses the same kind of theory
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I guess there are similarities but not quite the same chaining wise I think (I didn't even do D&amp;B)
 MSmits: it has a similar graph, except when you remove a line, you also possibly add a new line (= edge).
 Astrobytes: Any recommended papers?
 MSmits: the one that was shared earlier
 Astrobytes: I think I may have been afk for that
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf">https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf</a>
 MSmits: but it gets very mathematical, very quickly
 MSmits: may need to do some side-searches to get through it
 Astrobytes: Hmmm one of those
 MSmits: it's worth it to read about nim and numbers before you go in there
 MSmits: nimbers that is
 MSmits: i have some knowledge of that, but i still find it hard to get through it
 MSmits: this is one of winands students. I think it might also not be written very well, because of his inexperi3ence
 MSmits: but there is not much else
 MSmits: it's pretty indepth
 Astrobytes: That doesn't look too bad, other than the nimbers (of which I have basic knowledge) it's pretty readable no?
 MSmits: page 14
 Astrobytes: (just glancing at it, maybe it's harder to follow)
 MSmits: look at the table
 MSmits: there's all sorts of weird notation
 MSmits: the paper assumes you've seen it before in some form and it's mostly a quick recap i think, or is intended to b e
 AntiSquid: so many games ported to cg geez, still didn't play the pengu one seriously
 MSmits: but of course if you never have, it's pretty painful to get through those pages and you may need extra reading
 MSmits: me neither, not yet anyway
 AntiSquid: you didn't even submit
 MSmits: no thats what i mean
 MSmits: it seems interesting
 MSmits: but no time
 AntiSquid: i submitted but don't call it serious 
 MSmits: still want to do jace ks game too
 MSmits: and some others
 MSmits: and eulers game, but it seems hard
 Astrobytes: ooh I see MSmits
 AntiSquid: which one of euler's games?
 MSmits: tryangle
 MSmits: i played the other ones
 MSmits: actually no, i didnt do tower defense either
 MSmits: just onitama
 Astrobytes: I don't know if that's Knuth notation or what
 MSmits: it's related to nimbers i think
 MSmits: it's all combinatorial math
 MSmits: same math used in nim, D&amp;B
 MSmits: and that hackenbush game they talk about
 Astrobytes: Oh christ fields
 MSmits: i think he's not online
 MSmits: so he wont see that new nickname
 Astrobytes: No, it's field theory some of it
 MSmits: ahhh
 MSmits: not sure, it does look a bit like QM notation, but diffeent
 MSmits: i dont see any tensors?
 AntiSquid: there, done some power submits in D-lang now i started all games
 MSmits: you started all games??
 AntiSquid: with an initial submit, yes
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimber">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimber</a>
 MSmits: at least you're not one of those people who is afraid to have a rank 2000 on their profile
 Astrobytes: Scroll down 
 MSmits: finite fields?
 Astrobytes: Aye
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: might be a different kind of field than the ones in physics?
 Astrobytes: No shit!
 MSmits: hehe well... maybe i'll be learning some new stuff for this game. Depending on how addicted i get
 MSmits: oh it has the e2e3 notation. 
 MSmits: time to steal some conversion stuff from other bots
 MSmits: that conversion stuff hurts my head
 MSmits: checkers might have the same
 Astrobytes: Think I used my Othello one
 MSmits: oh right, thats closer
 reCurse: Conversion?
 MSmits: to board coords with a1 and such
 MSmits: from bitboard
 reCurse: Isn't that a one liner?
 MSmits: probably, but I mess it up and I have the top of the board as the low bits
 MSmits: then i have to invert the board... that sort of thing
 MSmits: i make it hard for myself
 jacek: i copy paste from other games but sometimes i need to flip columns and/or rows
 reCurse: You could just ignore game conventions, use your own, and translate it only at the step closest to input or output
 MSmits: thats where i am at
 Astrobytes: That's what we do&#160;:)
 MSmits: i'm done with move generation and such, just trying to output the moves so i can test the sim
 reCurse: Which game
 Astrobytes: Clobber
 MSmits: my othello does this:
 MSmits: 	string bestCol(1, 'a' + bestBitIndex&#160;% 8);	int bestRow = 1 + bestBitIndex / 8;
 jacek: i tried to nn first. i copy pasted 'framework' from other games but it couldnt learn anything at all. i thought i had some errors there
 jacek: at the very least, even with crappy inputs, new network should be better than the first random one. but it wasnt
 MSmits: was it a bug?
 jacek: dunno, i searched but i eventually gave up
 Astrobytes: Reading board wrong way round or something
 jacek: my bot is just mcts
 MSmits: well for D&amp;B i expect this result, but clobber has some eval options, so nn should help
 Astrobytes: Quite a few eval options
 jacek: in d&amp;b learned network was indeed better than random
 MSmits: oh it was? Did you get a good bot from it?
 jacek: it had a strength more or less what i have submited now
 jacek: 15th rank
 jacek: which is mcts
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: so still way better than clobber
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: maybe if it gets approved ill get more serious
 MSmits: maybe it has problems with the high branching?
 MSmits: you might have these issues with amazons
 Astrobytes: Is your derjack your learning bot in Clobber jacek or your main bot?
 jacek: nah, it works for amazons
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Astrobytes: Oh, interesintg
 Astrobytes: *Interesting
 jacek: no, clobber is mcts. derjack is random
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 jacek: though for amazons for now i have good old alphabeta
 jacek: but locally i have nn that beats him 90%
 Astrobytes: Very nice
 jacek: so if you piss me off..
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: It seems to be that MCTS is the way forward with Clobber
 Astrobytes: Though I haven't tried all ab enhancements yet
 Astrobytes: Or eval options for that matter
 MSmits: mmh it's trying to go from d1 to d8
 Astrobytes: Are you reading the board in normally
 MSmits: what do you mean normally?
 jacek: as in, not abnormally
 Astrobytes: 0 - boardSize
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: for y and x
 MSmits: so the low bits are up top
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b88fd081-9830-4f73-80aa-5c0f874b0768">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b88fd081-9830-4f73-80aa-5c0f874b0768</a>
 MSmits: probably i should just check if the bitindices are valid on a paper grid
 Astrobytes: but you're given the a1 square first remember
 MSmits: well that helps&#160;:)
 MSmits: no it starts at top
 MSmits: a8 first
 Astrobytes: 8 I mean
 Astrobytes: (duh)
 MSmits: yeah i knew that
 MSmits: its some other bug
 MSmits: but gonna try jaceks nice array
 MSmits: can always use a one liner later
 jacek: prunearray
 MSmits: mmh i am confused though, why is H8 your first square?
 GeorgiD: 54 21 6 33 14 70 20 88 99 14 -&gt; 21 54 6 33 14 70 20 88 14 991 2 6 5 4 -&gt; 1 2 5 6 4
 GeorgiD: What is the logic behind those 2 outputs
 Astrobytes: I have A1 as my first
 jacek: hmm i think i have my parsing reversed as well
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64b79f34-9f38-4f1a-8e64-b3d43ee4d9a6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64b79f34-9f38-4f1a-8e64-b3d43ee4d9a6</a>
 jacek: GeorgiD pairs? first number lower than second in pair?
 MSmits: yeah you do it differently
 GeorgiD: Hm yeah you are right
 GeorgiD: Thank you
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I do this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c317ff66-24a0-41da-8557-78907bce69cb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c317ff66-24a0-41da-8557-78907bce69cb</a>
 MSmits: right yeah, I think mine works ok, the conversion at least. It's the sim thats broken
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b51cbdd9-a2da-457c-8aa2-4074f13b95b8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b51cbdd9-a2da-457c-8aa2-4074f13b95b8</a>
 MSmits: after move
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/55e609c8-9646-4dda-b0ea-b3950d7fb27b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/55e609c8-9646-4dda-b0ea-b3950d7fb27b</a>
 MSmits: so it jumped from top to bottom
 MSmits: it actually outputs this correctly
 MSmits: d8d1
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: no idea how i managed this
 Astrobytes: I had such problems, it was all bitwise idiocy
 Astrobytes: What's your movegen algo? Not details but generally
 MSmits: it's not rocket science
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee2dcba7-231b-4059-8f39-b67c6078d393">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee2dcba7-231b-4059-8f39-b67c6078d393</a>
 MSmits: can be written more efficiently and with less repeated code ofc
 Astrobytes: Oh you do them all in one like that
 Astrobytes: I have an array
 MSmits: yeah, thats what i usually do
 MSmits: hmm, an array of moves?
 Astrobytes: You need to order them at some point in alphabeta so gotta have an array
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/923e0643-d56b-4f22-a33d-9f515a52c8da">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/923e0643-d56b-4f22-a33d-9f515a52c8da</a>
 MSmits: thats unoptimized due to conditionals
 jacek: meh
 MSmits: but i guess its a good start
 MSmits: steal mine if you want, but fix the bug first
 MSmits: and let me know what the bug is :P
 MYBK: Hi, about coders strike back, I want to create a solution using Heuristic algorithm like Genetic Algorithm, (I read some article in the matter) but what I did not understand, how can I choose the best individual to compete after training them especially if the genome consist of the next 6 turn... can anyone explain the matter a little bit more please  ?
 MSmits: it's weird, an upmove should not wraparound to the bottom, uint64_t doesnt wrap around on shift
 MSmits: sorry MYBK, GA is not my specialty
 MSmits: many of us here know though
 MSmits: bit late euro time
 jacek: can bitIndex be negative?
 jacek: or rather bitIndex-8
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: hmm
 Astrobytes: switch your shift directions for up and down
 darkhorse64: Why not writing directly into the child&#160;?
 darkhorse64: oops lag
 MYBK: emm I understand, thank you @MSmits :D 
 MSmits: dunno darkhorse64 did not give it much thought yet
 MSmits: c7c8 is what it did now
 MSmits: which would be ok, if that wasnt a black move
 MSmits: but... improvement
 MSmits: was this a guess Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: ctz or clz
 MSmits: or did you notice something?
 MSmits: shouldnt matter ctz or clz
 MSmits: only the order is different
 Astrobytes: It does if you do other stuff the wrong way round
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: always use ctz
 Astrobytes: It wasn't a guess no, I had some similar issues
 MSmits: I see
 darkhorse64: MYBK: you choose the genome that has the best score. Sorry if it is an obvious answer
 AntiSquid: asking on discord and here? so where do you want the answer?
 Astrobytes: Right, I am reallllly tired.
 Astrobytes: I bid you all goodnight
 AntiSquid: do some push ups to get the blood circulation up
 AntiSquid: good night
 MSmits: gn!
 Astrobytes: With my back issues that woudl be very interesting AntiSquid!
 AntiSquid: i've read somewhere exercise can prevent sleep :D
 MSmits: darkhorse64, when i print the board when it's received as input i get
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I'm sure you'll figure the bugs out but if not hit me up tomorrow
 MSmits: will do, thanks Astrobytes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd122b4a-6296-4fe6-a447-c2e8efc628d6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd122b4a-6296-4fe6-a447-c2e8efc628d6</a>
 MSmits: but topleft square is white
 MSmits: in the cerr it's black
 MSmits: :confused;
 Astrobytes: you're reading it in as white
 MSmits: yeah
 cobunny: Whats this pattern  input: 101output 10201
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: Your bitboard is going from 0 = a1 to 63 = h8
 MSmits: correct, but this is not about the bitboard, i am just printing it as it is inputted
 MSmits: without using bitboard
 Astrobytes: yes, that's how it's given
 MSmits: but it's not how it looks in the viewer
 MSmits: in the viewer topleft is white and in cerr topleft is black
 Astrobytes: yes, because bottom left is a1
 MSmits: right, but it says in the description it gives info top to bottom
 MSmits: so it should appear in cerr the same way as it looks in viewer
 cobunny: what's the math formula from 101 to 10201
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I was also confused about it
 MSmits: is this a description error?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but it is minor stuff
 Astrobytes: Oh right, yeah, I guess it is
 MSmits: Next boardSize lines: line: a string of characters representing one horizontal row of the grid, top to bottom.
 Astrobytes: But you can figure that out pretty quick at least
 MSmits: yeah, my mind is just set to assume descriptions are perfect. I forgot it's a wip&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: STILL: SHAME ON YOU AND YOUR ANKLES darkhorse64
 Binary_Sky: thats just squared
 AntiSquid: never forget the mobius striptease
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I was just checking the inputs. I have a bug
 cobunny: n*n
 Astrobytes: No wonder we all had to do some jiggery-pokery here
 MSmits: will crash every bot on the board if you fix it darkhorse64
 UnnamedCodinGamer: fix the text
 darkhorse64: Not mine
 MSmits: well unless you fix the description, but that woul dbe counter to every  other games description
 Astrobytes: It's just a WIP, as long as that's indicated it's OK technically
 MSmits: they all receive input top to bottom
 MYBK: @darkhorse64 thank you for responding, I need a sec to reformulate my question... I am too confused about the problem that I didn't know what to ask
 MSmits: yay my bot works
 MYBK: GG
 darkhorse64: I'll fix the referee because I want to stick to the rules
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cbbfa430-2706-4303-9bf3-d1b6026c100d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cbbfa430-2706-4303-9bf3-d1b6026c100d</a>
 MSmits: i added the 7-i
 MSmits: instead of i
 MSmits: to reverse vertically
 MSmits: so if you fix it i just go back to just i
 AntiSquid: guys i am giving you a 10 second count down before i ask my question, then i will ask whether i can ask the question to make sure you're still here
 Astrobytes: there's a world of ways to do it
 Tuo: at MYBK question: how can you run a genetic algorithm on a CG game?
 Tuo: you would need your own game engine?
 AntiSquid: that has been done countless time Tuo 
 MSmits: you need to simulate the game indeed Tuo
 MSmits: or at least simulate the parts of it you want to optimize
 AntiSquid: the standard CG boiler plate code
 Astrobytes: anyway, now I sleep. gn again!
 MSmits: for simple games that i strivial
 MSmits: yeah gn and thanks again
 AntiSquid: only one gn wishing per day, gotta ration that
 UnnamedCodinGamer: gn
 darkhorse64: I'll post a message in the forum once it's fixed. Not before this weekend
 UnnamedCodinGamer: like soma in brave new world
 MSmits: no hurry darkhorse64
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, no hurry
 AntiSquid: no! hurry darkhorse64
 UnnamedCodinGamer: does the submit history get preserved after a change in the game?
 MSmits: no idea
 lopidav: is it hard to make multiplayer games here and where to start?
 darkhorse64: play them or design one&#160;?
 lopidav: design one
 AntiSquid: answering own question @_@
 darkhorse64: CG supplies a Java SDK including a few examples. The source code for many contribs is also available
 lopidav: oh, for some reason I thought it uses c++
 lopidav: is it hard tho. How many hrs are needed to make something like trolls and castles?
 AntiSquid: probably 1&#160;?
 lopidav: 1 hour?
 MSmits: depends on the coder
 darkhorse64: You should ask JBM, the author
 MSmits: probably days 
 AntiSquid: depends on familiarity with the SDK
 darkhorse64: depends on your ambitions
 AntiSquid: troll vs castles is one of the least time consuming ones
 darkhorse64: Clobber took me less than two days but I reuse lots of code
 AntiSquid: i have an idea, but i keep ruminating on it for ages
 AntiSquid: it's most important to trick people into liking it and do that first submit lopidav
 AntiSquid: hint: the D submits aren't your target crowd
 lopidav: what's "D submits"?
 AntiSquid: glad you asked
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dlang.org/">https://dlang.org/</a>
 AntiSquid: D is a general-purpose programming language with static typing, systems-level access, and C-like syntax.
 lopidav: of, a language. I thought it's a rank or something
 lopidav: *oh
 AntiSquid: it is a social rank
 AntiSquid: of high standards
 MSmits: mmh darkhorse64, are you right now messing with clobber?
 cobunny:  144 return true why?
 cobunny: wasting time puzzle
 MSmits: cuz it's like the input switched around again
 AntiSquid: try to do something other than clash
 cobunny: 3325424654
 cobunny: this all true
 AntiSquid: there's a whole world outside that cave of clash
 cobunny: Kinda addicted and need to practice to get a new job
 Mario100o: hi
 AntiSquid: that's NOT how you get a job
 Devinawesley: I got sent here during an interview and just been playing since 
 AntiSquid: unless there's a company hiring clashers
 cobunny: Same here
 AntiSquid: try this then:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fireworks">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fireworks</a>
 cobunny: The questions are not very practical for a technical interview
 AntiSquid: or something else that's fun
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't do puzzles for interviews
 cobunny: Where do you practice for interviews
 cobunny: I mean is there any timed tests like this 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: MSmits, input seems unchanged. First line is "bwbwbwbw".
 MSmits: ye, is my mistake, nvm darkhorse64
 cobunny: I'm looking for software engineer/backend dev interview practice test or some sort
 AntiSquid: cobunny play this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a> get legend, i guarantee you will realize how to get a job much easier
 cobunny: I'll try it later. Thanks
 MSmits: no dont lol.. AntiSquid is evil
 AntiSquid: no evil, it's true, look at the wording MSmits, also the more you postpone the longer it will take to get that job
 AntiSquid: it makes you think and deal with difficult situations
 AntiSquid: like in interviews
 MSmits: sure, you will learn never to try that again :p
 cobunny: What do you mean?
 AntiSquid: you're the evil one to be frank MSmits
 cobunny: :rolling_eyes:
 AntiSquid: so much hate for the game
 MSmits: i never played it
 AntiSquid: cobunny in interviews they test problem solving skills
 MSmits: i just listen to people complain about it
 AntiSquid: you need to step it up
 AntiSquid: you just follow the herd&#160;?
 MSmits: cobunny, go do uttt&#160;:)
 MSmits: the herd does it
 MSmits: :sheep:
 cobunny: I'm gonna go. Ice cream time
 AntiSquid: cobunny point is you need to think outside the box and there's a need for the right trigger to make that happen, i showed you the way to the water, you must drink on your own
 MSmits: :ice_cream:
 MSmits: :icecream:
 AntiSquid: or the ice cream if you will, you must lick it yourself, nobody will lick it for you
 MSmits: i'll do it
 cobunny: What????
 Tuo: y i agree u are both evil :smiley:
 AntiSquid: otherwise it wouldn't be your ice cream anymore
 MSmits: gimme your icecream
 cobunny: No!
 MSmits: he's standing up for himself already AntiSquid
 MSmits: CG teaches you confidence
 cobunny: I'm F
 cobunny: sorry guys
 MSmits: you're an A
 AntiSquid: doesn't matter
 MSmits: confidence!
 cobunny: I mean Female
 cobunny: lol
 MSmits: ohh ok
 AntiSquid: i would have typed the exact same words no matter who you are
 cobunny: haha..
 cobunny: Thanks though
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: need more female coders
 cobunny: Nerdyy..
 MSmits: don't scare this one away AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: wtf&#160;?
 MSmits: :grin:
 AntiSquid: who did i scare away?
 MSmits: I was kidding ofc
 cobunny: Later guys.  Ice cream is melting:grin:
 AntiSquid: really? you keep trashing botters and me
 MSmits: allright see you later&#160;:)
 MSmits: botters of the galaxy?
 AntiSquid: best game
 MSmits: I'm just trying to prevent a new player to trying to write a 2k line sim :P
 AntiSquid: you don't need a bloody sim and you don't need 2k lines
 AntiSquid: actually a lot of the "popular" games need just that 2k lines of sims
 MSmits: hmmh, well I'll take your word for it, it's not what others told me
 AntiSquid: if you can golf the other ones then you can golf botters
 MSmits: you really like the game or still messing?
 AntiSquid: MSmits just try it yourself
 MSmits: i was just trying to figure out if you were kidding
 AntiSquid: there's certain aspects people don't like about it
 AntiSquid: but only certain people
 MSmits: the 5%?
 AntiSquid: from there it's word of mouth
 MSmits: I see
 AntiSquid: and then there is sort of a circumstantial appeal / activity
 MSmits: well if you honestly like it, it's fine. I thought you were trolling the new player&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't suggest pacman is top notch game, but participation count and word of mouth matters more
 MSmits: sure
 AntiSquid: i am just saying it's a biased opinion you rely on
 MSmits: but i dont like it when new players quit because everything is too hard
 MSmits: if botters is easy to get into, it might be a good starter game
 AntiSquid: there's a CG meta, or at least there was one, people followed specific boiler plate code standards and then complained a contest broke things for them
 MSmits: hmm, i never knew that
 AntiSquid: it is a good starter game, it has a lot of inputs, which is what many complain about, thing is you don't need to take everything into account
 MSmits: I see
 AntiSquid: it's what i got from the complaints, people keep saying it's intentionally made to be anti-simulation lol
 AntiSquid: there was never such intent
 MSmits: seems to me there's just a lot going on 
 MSmits: a lot to sim
 MSmits: like FB
 Tuo: i have it open now: game explanation is less lines then inputs
 dittygoops: tiddygooper in the house
 AntiSquid: ya exactly, it looks like a lot, but there's a lot you can just skip through and focus on what matters
 dittygoops: *dittygooper
 Tuo: looks pretty scary :D
 AntiSquid: more like how i have a half-complete bot for fireworks
 AntiSquid: trying to think of a best analogy
 AntiSquid: probably there is none, but you can stick to one thing and make progress basically
 Tuo: well first league beaten!!! how is thought now&#160;:) im coming for u(after spring challenge maybe) 
 AntiSquid: you can use it to practice for spring challenge
 Tuo: 1 day left, how much can u practice?
 AntiSquid: oh lol shit so soon? 
 AntiSquid: should have booked my holidays one week later (had to take it or i lose them now before april)
 AntiSquid: oh well got the first weekend then
 AntiSquid: tuo you can get into the contest spirit by sprinting up the botters ladder
 Westicles: Is it May already?
 alopikon: But, it is not march 6, it is may 6, isn't it?
 AntiSquid: ya just checked it's in may lol
 Tuo: oh shit
 AntiSquid: tuo you have 1 day + all the remaining time 
 Tuo: y :D
 AntiSquid: guess on the 6th everyone is going to spam what happened to the contest?
 Tuo: well this is sad
 Tuo: i was excited for a competition
 AntiSquid: you have more time for botters now
 AntiSquid: by the time contest starts you will be breaking bots and bits
 Tuo: lousy non native english speaking brain mixing up stuff&#160;:(
 Tuo: y much time to prepare

 DiDzTM: Hi!
 klyons: give me the anw3er or else
 Scarfield: 42
 AntiSquid: that's not an anw3er Scarfield
 Scarfield: no, but it's the answ3r
 Scarfield: anyway im for for today, gn whoever is still here
 AntiSquid: bye bye

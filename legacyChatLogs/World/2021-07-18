 rememberThis: how is everybody
 WhaIe: if anyone wants to join a clash of code livestream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/senamonry">https://www.twitch.tv/senamonry</a>
 CodeAce: Hello World
 dbdr: hey martinpapa69
 martinpapa69: morning 
 dbdr: making progress?
 martinpapa69: ye it looks like. I removed like 10 different stuff from the code, that i thought to be "hacky"
 dbdr: minimalism is good&#160;:)
 dbdr: from the training?
 martinpapa69: from the training, and now from the "core"
 HippocratesLlama: So I'm doing a league based challenge, my first that I've tried, and It says that I got the the ranking 1 spot but I can't see how I move on to the next higher league
 HippocratesLlama: Any tips?
 HippocratesLlama: Nevermind
 HippocratesLlama: I have to wait a few minutes apparently lol
 HippocratesLlama: Sorry P
 dbdr: no problem. there should be a countdown timer at the top of the screen before promotion
 lawlmanx: hey guys I have problem that I am doing the exercise "Coders strike back"
 lawlmanx: the racing game 
 lawlmanx: but it sometimes doesn´t even load 
 lawlmanx: It just says the boss won
 Marchete: I'd like to know what's hacky :thinking:
 Natjisu-Kid: so hard for newbie like me
 martinpapa69: wouldn't say every stuff i removed is hacky, more like unnecessary complexity. I like my code as simple as possible. but, ye, once i get decent result, i can make a list :D 
 dbdr: top 2 to 5 is pure RPS I think
 Marchete: :confused:
 dbdr: I was #2 this morning
 Marchete: indeed dbdr
 Marchete: I find winrates as snowballing
 Marchete: either 0% or 100%
 Marchete: single initial gamestate
 jacek: oh my
 Marchete: rather deterministic NNs
 Marchete: so RPS
 Marchete: you were 1st for some time yesterday
 dbdr: during a robo submit? :D
 Marchete: no
 dbdr: :o
 dbdr: I thought at least robo was clearly betterI mean he is
 Marchete: he is
 Marchete: spam submits, and at some point he tied and you don't
 LINDI_SHAH: yo
 LINDI_SHAH:&#160;:)
 devguy: do enybody can help me out
 jacek: with?
 devguy: a puzzel with the name Temperatures
 jacek: and whats the problem
 devguy: i cant get the second number right
 jacek: and what number do you get
 devguy: first i need to type 1 thats good but by te second analasy i need a -5 
 jacek: because its closest to 0. or rather its absolute value is closest to 0
 devguy: but how do i swith the numbers
 jacek: dont hardcode the answers. for each test case you get different numbers and you need to print the right one
 devguy: do you maen that i need to type te closest numer out of the optoins i get
 jacek: yes
 devguy: thats 0
 devguy: end it dont work
 LINDI_SHAH: what this discord is useful for
 LINDI_SHAH: :O
 LINDI_SHAH: :nerd:
 Marchete: anything I try is worse than all previous ones
 MSmits: damn, I just replaced my hash table by unordered set and my bot is a factor of 3  faster :P
 MSmits:  i had a lossy hash table that overwrites previous results on conflict, usually thats so much faster that it doesnt matter you lose some results
 MSmits: it bothers me though, that there's implementations of hash tables out there that are 2-3x faster than the std implementations
 Marchete: don't you have some kind of "queue" on collisions?
 Marchete: like a loop 0..4
 Marchete: to check free spaces
 MSmits: usually that is slower, for example when doing minimax
 MSmits: at least that is my experience
 MSmits: but if the hash table is not a bottleneck at all, then losing results is unacceptable
 MSmits: did anyone ever convert one of those custom implementations that are faster than std, to something workable on CG?
 MSmits: they're all huge projects
 MSmits: but probably most of it is unnecessary
 MSmits: like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map">https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map</a>
 jacek: TT?
 jacek: whats wrong if unordered_map ~
 Marchete: your TT is turn based? like clearing data at some point?
 jacek: for minimax i clean tt at the start of my turn
 MSmits: unordered map works well, but benchmarks show it to be inferior
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tessil.github.io/2016/08/29/benchmark-hopscotch-map.html">https://tessil.github.io/2016/08/29/benchmark-hopscotch-map.html</a>
 Parceni: k
 Marchete: I don't know, I see a custom hashmap better
 Parceni: is this discord or is it something else
 MSmits: something else
 Marchete: imo all these libraries are huge
 MSmits: yeah thats what i said, but i think you dont need most of it
 Marchete: I do the simple way, take some bytes from hash to point to a big array
 Marchete: from there, check up to 4 hashes
 MSmits: why 4?
 Marchete: or 5
 Marchete: whatever
 Marchete: some small loop to avoid collisions
 MSmits: so does that mean the hash key leads to a maximum of 5 results?
 jacek: there was some custom hashtable implementation in connect4 solver eh?
 Marchete: also you can add some key to "invalidate" hashes
 Marchete: as a fast way to clean up
 MSmits: yeah i usually have a counter
 MSmits: next search has a higher index
 Marchete: and that's slower than unordered_map/set?
 MSmits: no, but it's lossy
 MSmits: unordered_map/set does not lose a single result
 MSmits: so do the others on the benchmark i just shared
 Marchete: if you are losing
 MSmits: and some are 2-3 times faster than unordered map
 Marchete: then either your hash is bad or you don't have enough space
 MSmits: your space is never going to be used homogeneously
 MSmits: even with a good hash function
 MSmits: so you're always going to need more room than you actually need
 Marchete: on law of big numbers
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: it will be mostly homogeneous
 Marchete: it's like a random()
 Marchete: it should be homogeneous on the whole range
 Marchete: if not
 MSmits: anyways, my point was not to compare lossy hashmap to lossless
 Marchete: then it's bad
 MSmits: i know a lossy hashmap can minimize loss to a small amount
 Marchete: lossless can imply resizing
 Marchete: clears() are costly
 MSmits: yes, but you can reserve
 MSmits: if you know how many irems
 MSmits: items
 MSmits: you can guess this
 Marchete: just try
 martinpapa69: do you put your object directly in the  hashmap/set?
 Marchete: debug to see collisions
 martinpapa69: like unordered_set&lt;MyType&gt;
 Marchete: I'd say with a big size
 Marchete: like 2x your expected storage
 MSmits: with a big size it becomes really slow
 Marchete: a loop of 5 it should have near zero collisions
 MSmits: but it would need to be 5 times as big right?
 Marchete: 2x
 MSmits: why 2?
 MSmits: i mean if you store 5 items per key
 MSmits: you need 5 times the roo
 MSmits: room
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: I'm saying
 Marchete: that your hash can have collisions
 MSmits: where would you store the overflow of colliding hash keys?
 Marchete: so to avoid them you allow some little search
 Marchete: to find the nearest free spot
 Marchete: that's the 5
 Marchete: it should have a formal name
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i get it now
 Marchete: you can also "save" the overflow on a reserve array
 Marchete: if it's that important
 martinpapa69: there is a built in stuff for that, dunno if you heard about it&#160;: unordered_multiset
 RoboStac: they're normally called buckets
 Marchete: "buckets"
 Marchete: thx :D
 MSmits: buckets arent normally in a fixed size array are they?
 MSmits: aren't they like a vector structur?
 MSmits: or something
 Marchete: you can also have that
 RoboStac: it depends on the implementation
 Marchete: array of buckets then vectors
 Marchete: but vectors will resize
 MSmits: yes, but you would need those only on collision
 Marchete: I'd say prefer static
 RoboStac: for a lossless map you'll always need some sort of resizeable storage for hash collisions
 Marchete: and collisions should be rare
 MSmits: RoboStac Marchete *nearly* solves this by doing a search for empty places in static array
 MSmits: but he still has some loss i guess
 RoboStac: yeah, but at some point thats lossy
 RoboStac: or really slow if you don't limit the search
 RoboStac: (I do the same)
 MSmits: I think this depends on how much loss you can tolerate
 MSmits: do you have a percentage Marchete?
 MSmits: for your general use of this&#160;?
 Parceni: @everyone
 RoboStac: yeah - and sizes of buckets etc depends on hash collision rate / calculation times / chance of repeated lookups
 RoboStac: so it's all very dependant on the exact problem
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I am using it for D&amp;B where a loss of 10% is apparently unacceptable. 
 MSmits: switching to unordered set gave me 3x speedup
 Marchete: make a big array
 MSmits: thats what i had
 MSmits: but without the search you mention
 Marchete: and if and only if you really need to be lossçless
 Marchete: then add some resizeable alternative storage
 Marchete: for when that little search failed
 Marchete: 99% of the lookup/set will be fast
 MSmits: i wonder how this will compare with unordered set
 Marchete: 1% will be slow
 Marchete: internally will be similar
 Marchete: I imagine
 RoboStac: unordered_* is usually slightly slow because the std spec places quite large restrictions on the implementation
 MSmits: well thanks, I will put this on my list. Seems like a usefull skill/standard piece of code i need to have
 MSmits: good to know RoboStac
 RoboStac: iirc it's something to do with not invalidating pointers/iterators on changes to other parts of the map
 MSmits: in other words, it's proper safe coding. Who needs that :P
 MSmits: brb
 VinhDaDen: i use Pascal hehe
 Marchete: I feel your pain
 jacek: use delphi
 martinpapa69: ye, thats a rly good extension to pascal
 Parceni: is this discord?
 Parceni: what is this place
 Parceni: where am i
 Parceni: ahhhh
 Parceni: AHHHHH
 TheViralClovers: amogus
 TabulaRasa: hey, where can I find python libs available for bot challenges?
 TabulaRasa: is there a wiki somewhere with a list?
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 TabulaRasa: nice, thanks!
 codeing: holla
 codeing: what does anyone thing about RNN for classification problems&#160;?
 codeing: forecast prediction
 codeing: in deep learning
 MSmits: weather forecast?
 codeing: yeah
 MSmits: go do it I'd say
 codeing: hmm
 codeing: cool
 MSmits: could have used your NN last week when i was on vacation
 MSmits: they got it wrong every day
 codeing: NN mean neural network
 codeing: right&#160;?
 MSmits: yes
 codeing: kk
 codeing: why do they get wrong&#160;?
 MSmits: because weather forecast models are inaccurate
 codeing: hmm
 codeing: less that 0.5&#160;?
 codeing: right&#160;?
 codeing: than*
 codeing: inaccurate like&#160;?
 MSmits: what is?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: they say it rains and then it doesn't
 MSmits: if you want to put a number to that i'd say 1/pi
 codeing: cheap
 codeing: 1/pi = 0.3
 MSmits: kinda
 codeing: what model NN did you used 
 MSmits: i didnt
 codeing: k
 codeing: deep learning pretty cool
 codeing: tata, cya
 dbdr: weather forecast: today will be exactly like yesterday
 dbdr: it's correct at ~75%
 dbdr: after years of work and multi-million $ machines, you can get to 85%
 MSmits: nice
 dbdr: it's more satisfying to watch a bot go to random play to expert in one hour of training&#160;:)
 dbdr: *from
 codeing: @dbdr, with what deep learning model you get your 85&#160;%&#160;?
 codeing: RNN or NN&#160;?
 dbdr: not me, just what I heard about that field
 codeing: k
 codeing: thx
 IcyStar: does anyone know if there's a way not to reload the page when an error occurs&#160;? Because it makes me lose the current map..
 AllYourTrees: for producing a hash value for C4, can you just add the two bitboards together?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: I usually use:
 MSmits: inline uint64_t xorshift(uint64_t x) { x ^= x &gt;&gt; 12; x ^= x &lt;&lt; 25; x ^= x &gt;&gt; 27; return x * 0x2545F4914F6CDD1D; }
 MSmits: with 
 MSmits: p1 ^ xorshift(p2)
 MSmits: might not be the best way 
 AllYourTrees: :eyes:
 MSmits: you'll get collisions for sure, the questionis how many
 AllYourTrees: kk
 Astrobytes: Why not Zobrist?
 MSmits: zobrist might work I guess. Don't know how they compare
 Astrobytes: Zobrist is pretty standard for a lot of board games
 MSmits: I would be interested to know in what way it might be better
 RoboStac: for simple gamestates like this it's probably not worth it
 RoboStac: it's good when generating a hash from the full gamestate is slow
 MSmits: I see
 RoboStac: it's basically the same idea as nnue - do small updates every move instead of getting to the end and trying to calculate everything from scratch. Good if you need the hash every move or if it takes a long time 
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense, it also prevents you from taking into account things about your state that stay the same
 MSmits: which makes it more efficient
 MSmits: full state hash tends to take everything into account
 nulte: hi
 MSmits: hi
 linjoehan: hi
 linjoehan: how often fo you play clash of code?
 nulte: never
 Astrobytes: 0 clashes/year
 nulte: astro I dont think you should have lost this game
 nulte: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/570771728">https://www.codingame.com/replay/570771728</a>
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: No shit
 nulte: im still trying to find an eval, its not easy, I managed to get 70% locally but bot gets placed around same rank on leaderboard&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: I'm tweaking mine, hence the daft blunders :D
 nulte: my eval has range of 0.01 - -0.01, might be bugged
 nulte: lol
 nulte: should be 1 - -1
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: oh my
 Astrobytes: lol, I have a lop-sided eval
 Astrobytes: I clearly need another coffee
 Astrobytes: ffs&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: that is a tough top 20
 nkc20: ....................
 ericlovesmath: I wasn't sure, but is Google/StackOverflow during Clash of Code allowed?
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: anything is allowed frankly
 Alex000reid: imagine if you couldn't use stackoverflow 
 Shozy: don't need to imagine
 Shozy: or do you mean in general couldn't use stackoverflow?
 Alex000reid: lmao even for coc I need that 
 derjack: hmm top20 with just 1ply search (ok, with 3ply 'solver')
 derjack: the policy could be something
 dbdr: bt?
 derjack: now resubmited to random bot
 nulte:&#160;:(
 derjack: :upside_down:
 nulte: I read that 4 depth is optimal
 nulte: for ept
 dbdr: 3 depth is optimal for ept
 nulte: on bt?
 dbdr: now you read two contradictory statements
 nulte: ...
 jacek: then try 3.5 depth
 dbdr: which one is true?
 jacek: depends on game and your eval obviously
 dbdr: right. probabilistic depth
 nulte: Still need to figure eval I guess
 nulte: I thought this would be a simple game to evaluate
 nulte: also on ept im doing player0_score - player1_score
 nulte: Is this ok?
 nulte: I never did EPT before
 jacek: do you propagate the eval as-is, or scale it to win/lose?
 nulte: no
 nulte: i propagate the eval
 nulte: so if player0 had eval of 0.8 and player1 0.7 I would backpropagate 0.1
 jacek: ok
 nulte: Should I backpropagete 1 / -1 instead?
 nulte: if score0 &gt; score1
 jacek: nah, its alright
 jacek: but you may want to adjust the C exploration
 Wontonimo: what game are you two working on&#160;?
 Wontonimo: breakthrough i'm guessing from the recent submit
 nulte: yes bt
 nulte: yeah i think the C is a bit of a problem
 nulte: I run out of nodes, never happened before to me
 jacek: your eval is faster than simulating the game eh
 nulte: hmm I have 5M+ evals on first turn
 Wontonimo: wow
 nulte: maybe my eval is just bad
 nulte: :D
 Wontonimo: that's a lot of evals
 Wontonimo: for 3x3 tictactoe with bitboard i was only getting 200k-500k evals in 100ms
 Wontonimo: (mcts)
 nulte: this is with ept
 jacek: evals?
 nulte: 8 plays
 Wontonimo: in 3x3 TTT, there are only 9 plays at the start, so i think it is a pretty good apples-to-apples comparison to ept with 8 plays
 nulte: wont i have problem if I change C
 nulte: but i still backpropagate 1 sometimes?
 Wontonimo: a low C means spending more time building depth, and high C means exploring more unvisited (possibly better) branches
 Wontonimo: i don't think C changes anything other than that
 nulte: I see
 nulte: problem might still be on eval I guess
 Wontonimo: C=0 is like greedy DFS, C=inf is like BFS, C~= (max(score)-min(score))*2 is close optimal tradeoff
 Wontonimo: so if you change your scoring functions range then you will have to change C
 nulte: my scoring range is [-1,1]
 jacek: bad sign while backpropagating?
 nulte: Dont think so
 Astrobytes: Did you try scaling your eval?
 nulte: scaling eval?
 Astrobytes: between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1
 MSmits: lol, just made my D&amp;B bot another 10 times faster and still not enough :P
 nulte: its always in -1 and 1 range
 nulte: the problem is that is almost close  to 0.0
 MSmits: D&amp;B is really unique in that the algorithm is so much more important than any performance consideration
 MSmits: nr 1 could translate his bot to python and still wreck everyone
 nulte: o.o
 Marchete: maybe all games are like that...
 nulte: not the game for me then
 MSmits: nah, not to this extent i am sure
 MSmits: D&amp;B has a divide and conquer approach that noone else uses. You split the board into subproblems
 MSmits: that's why the nr 1 is so much better and also why I am able to get such ridiculous speed increases
 Marchete: chains?
 MSmits: well that's part of it. But it's more about floodfilling the board. As soon as a part of the board splits off, you can solve it separately
 MSmits: not the score mind you, just whomever ends up in control
 Marchete: chains and chain count
 Marchete: i.e. domain knowledge
 MSmits: yes domain knowledge
 jacek: :unamused:
 Marchete: so I repeat, maybe all games are like that... just we don't know how to get the domain knowledge
 MSmits: then that's the difference
 MSmits: the fact that we don't
 AllYourTrees: what's D&amp;B?
 Astrobytes: dots and boxes
 BlaiseEbuth: Dungeons and bacon
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: or you could just train some kind of artificial intelligence to learn the domain knowledge :P 
 MSmits: it's the only game on CG my wife knows how to play 
 Marchete: :point_up_2:
 MSmits: Wontonimo there's a very key difference though
 MSmits: a NN will never be an exact solver in this sense
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'm just joking
 MSmits: it will only approximate
 MSmits: it's a good point though
 MSmits: even if it's a joke
 MSmits: this is precisely why NN's are used
 Wontonimo: just making a reference to the NN crazy that's sweeping CG (that I'm really loving btw)
 MSmits: because the domain knowledge is too hard to incorporate otherwise
 Wontonimo: and this is why git-copilot will not take our jobs (yet)
 MSmits: what is git copilot?
 Wontonimo:&#160;!?!?!  
 MSmits: I don't fly
 Astrobytes: Smits lives under a rock Wontonimo
 MSmits: that too
 Wontonimo: google it, watch some yt videos about it.  it does autocomplete for coding 
 MSmits: ah VS too
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Wontonimo: it is really quite futuristic
 nulte: # eval breakthrough
 nulte: nothing&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: and can code whole functions for you just using the description and name of the function
 MSmits: nice
 nulte: Should I take into account pieces row positions on eval?
 Astrobytes: I would advise it
 nulte: im kinda lost
 Astrobytes: What happened to brute-force and ignorance? :D
 MSmits: a while ago VS asked me whether i wanted it to use AI to make coding suggestions (beyond intellisense). Is this like copilot?
 nulte: it only gets you so far
 MSmits: I said no btw... so i dont know how that works
 nulte: the brute force got top 20 which is not completely bad :p
 Astrobytes: This is true
 Wontonimo: copilot uses openAIs GPT-3 network but instead of being trained on language, it is trained on github public repos.  It is scifi, truly 
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: GPT-3 is language processing?
 jacek: nulte hmm, the home row seems important eh
 Wontonimo: it is not autocomplete or suggestion, it is auto-coding of complete functions from just a description.  it can write unit tests for the function also
 jacek: "ai, make me the top1 d&amp;b bot" and itll write it?
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: no
 reCurse: I'll be surprised if anyone remembers it as anything but a gimmick one year from now
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Yeah, pretty much just poc currently I think
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHwnrYm0mNc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHwnrYm0mNc</a>  "GitHub Copilot CRUSHES Leetcode Interview Questions!"
 Astrobytes: also hi&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: to your point reCurse, it does require API calls to do, and so I'm guessing the cost of using it will be staggering.
 reCurse: That's the least of my concerns
 Wontonimo: what other concersn?
 reCurse: It's kind of hard coming up with a short version but there's plenty of criticisms that I align with
 AllYourTrees: aren't there licensing concerns?
 AllYourTrees: like it puts code that has a license from github into your code and the original authors dont get credit
 reCurse: Namely it doesn't save you any time because you either trust the code blindly, which you will pay later by having to understand and fix subtle bugs, or end up having to read it all again, which again is slower than writing it
 reCurse: Writing code is the least concern while coding
 reCurse: It's just a gimmick
 reCurse: A very nice technical achievement but with questionable practical use
 BlaiseEbuth: +100
 MSmits: this is the first thing i thought when watching the video
 MSmits: wait... he's checking all the code
 MSmits: so...
 reCurse: Those who were fearing for their jobs are either joking or ignorant
 MSmits: i am also not sure what it does. These code snippets are so small that it might be like the CG clash bots
 jacek: reCurse afraid of losing game developer job
 Wontonimo: i can see great value of having this for junior devs who are having a mental block, which happens all too often
 reCurse: No I think it's just a crutch that won't help them either
 MSmits: there might be some unforeseen benefits
 MSmits: when people cant find a solution they often look on stack overflow
 reCurse: It's like saying there's a benefit by having those automated proofs
 MSmits: the AI does that for you now
 reCurse: Not really if you don't end up applying it yourself
 reCurse: You don't learn anything
 Wontonimo: i'd like it, just to see a different way of coding than i would.  I'd certainly use it to improve my skills, just like I use pair programming to do that
 Wontonimo: and i learn stuff even when pair programming with someone much more junior than i am
 reCurse: The stackoverflow answer often comes with very valuable context
 reCurse: I'll still take that over gpt-3
 nulte: I just hope no one has to use the code I wrote
 jacek: you dont blindly copy paste code from stackoverflow? :o
 reCurse: I'd probably ban its usage in a workplace if up to me
 Wontonimo: indeed, if it came with the context and discussion/alternatives that are in SO, that would add huge value.  
 MSmits: say I am trying to code something and trying to come up with a description to help copilot solve it for me
 Wontonimo: i don't think it will be a silver bullet, and unless the cost to use it is near zero I think it won't get adoption at-this-time
 MSmits: the effort itself is a form of rubber ducking
 MSmits: once you have the description right, you might no longer need the code it provides for you
 MSmits: which is useful, you can use the decription you came up with, in your code base as comments
 jacek: sometimes it could give you very bad code, but fixing or even rewriting bad code seems easier than making one from scratch
 jacek: like with that godwin's law
 reCurse: Imagine having to do something like that with copilot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/655607559221379072/the-art-of-asking-nicely">https://aiweirdness.com/post/655607559221379072/the-art-of-asking-nicely</a>
 jacek: noice. its like asking your sunconciousness to create something in lucid dream
 Wontonimo: it's not going to write a whole system for you.  I wouldn't use it on the NN work I do, but at where I work there is a lot of dumb repetitive angular code where i see copilot would crush it
 reCurse: If I have to review what's written to make sure it's actually doing what's intended I didn't save anything
 reCurse: Anyway'
 reCurse: !remindme 1 year
 jacek: Automaton2000 are you behind the copilot?
 <b>**Wontonimo sends calendar reminder</b></p><p><img src="/a/40502662118268" /> Automaton2000: or is it because i am not good at programming
 jacek: hm
 Wontonimo: HAHA
 Wontonimo: my last €0.02, i don't think copilot is going to change much, and i also think it is going to have a crisis of marketability/profit.  It would be fun to play with and I think useful as a teaching tool for super junior coders.

 Marchete: from my work: "A project is always ####, except when it doesn't"
 Marchete: and I replied, then it isn't a ####
 Marchete: "no no no, it is, except in some cases"
 KiwiTae: :joy: Marchete makes you feel good about your motivation &gt;&lt;
 Marchete: copilot would explode with user requeriments
 Marchete: until that they they keep thinking the same
 Marchete: even with counter examples of why that's a bad idea
 jacek: then make ai that would know what they want
 KiwiTae: its like ok google for programming lol
 reCurse: True, one of the first things I turn off
 KiwiTae: its gonna be handy for next cg contest, shortcutter:// i want my bot to win this game
 reCurse: Reminder: First contest not to mention multiplayer or bot in advance :P
 MSmits: we did have detective pikaptcha
 jacek: you think its gonna be one long clash of code?
 reCurse: Maybe some escape room contest shrug
 reCurse: Who knows
 BlaiseEbuth: :nauseated_face:
 struct: another one?
 reCurse: The fact they didn't copy the multiplayer contest template directly like so many others before says a lot imo
 reCurse: Removing type, duration, faq, etc
 struct: They did say in discord that they do not know what the next contest will be
 reCurse: I'm fine with it being over actually
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(

 reCurse: And chess will keep that itch scratched for a while
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: there have been plenty of different winners over time though
 MSmits: many that won only 1 time
 MSmits: like closetAI, I think Robo (not sure if he won another), jolindien
 reCurse: Heh used to have that contest leaderboard thing
 reCurse: Most winners only won once
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Only 7 did more than once
 MSmits: there are a few guys that, when they participate have a high likelyhood of winning
 MSmits: but they dont always participate and sometimes there's more than 1 of them
 MSmits: like when you and pb 4 are both in, I would not predict
 reCurse: Put your money on pb4, easy
 MSmits:  i would not put any money in 
 jacek: :money_with_wings:
 Wontonimo: how's your newest NN doing reCurse?
 Wontonimo: the one in diapers 
 reCurse: Trying to get him to sleep
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF_nfazQaek">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF_nfazQaek</a>
 Wontonimo: "Naptime"
 Wontonimo: product innovation
 jacek: any cheesy NN lately?
 reCurse: Think I almost worked my magic but it's still buggy sometimes
 reCurse: Crossing fingers now
 jacek: kindergarten magic?
 reCurse: Sleep spell
 Wontonimo: aka rocking chair&#160;?
 Plantchant: tmw u get #2 in the league so you cant advance D:
 Wontonimo: which league&#160;?
 Plantchant: only bronze
 reCurse: Before I went MIA for 3 weeks I had a SL NN kick my ass at chess with 1k nodes, which might only indicate how terrible I am
 struct: Whats SL NN?
 reCurse: supervised learning
 reCurse: Just took a bunch of engine games
 struct: wasnt your ranking above 1.6k?
 struct: elo*
 jacek: and MIA?
 struct: missing in action
 jacek: oh
 reCurse: I was still climbing on lichess when I was playing
 reCurse: Almost 1.9k
 jacek: SL, just like nnue guys train
 reCurse: Though I'm pretty sure it was just a lucky streak
 linjoehan: I'm 1.3k on chess.com and 1.5 on lichess, but thats for blitz I think I'm better at standard but I don't thave the time to test that
 reCurse: That's weird, your ratings should have a bigger gap
 linjoehan: 1.9 is massive man
 reCurse: Not really
 reCurse: 1.9 on lichess is like 1.2 on chesscom
 reCurse: Or was it 1.3
 struct: i think 1.3k
 reCurse: Percentile wise anyway
 Wontonimo: Plantchant, which multi&#160;?
 linjoehan: is that just because all the top dudes play at chess over lichess?
 reCurse: Hard to do it accurately because lichess only shows distribution for last week and chesscom does alltime
 reCurse: I'd tend to think lichess favors player with more skill under titled
 struct: I think they use diferent rating system
 reCurse: Glicko is still calibrated to have similar rating gap vs winrate if I'm not mistaken
 reCurse: chesscom is very mainstream and the bigger numbers are usually on the lower ends
 linjoehan: ah ok which one is closer to the one fide uses?
 reCurse: Neither because it's more about the player pool than the rating system
 reCurse: Your best bet is to use percentile until the top 1-2% then you're screwed
 reCurse: IMHO
 dbdr: what's a node in 1k nodes, reCurse?
 reCurse: mcts node
 reCurse: So a game state
 jacek: using policy?
 dbdr: aha, that's tiny then. limiting to make deterministic?
 reCurse: Limiting to give me a fighting chance
 reCurse: It's ruthless
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 jacek: youre playing chess960?
 reCurse: No standard chess, that's what I have the data for anyway
 jacek: oh
 dbdr: do you beat  the NN alone without search?
 reCurse: Same framework as usual except without the RL part
 reCurse: It's probably very easy at 2 nodes
 reCurse: Let me try
 dbdr: famous last words&#160;;)
 dbdr: I think alphazero chess NN alone was at 3000 elo. of course they have a huge net
 reCurse: Yeah mine is the usual minimalist
 reCurse: That's the angle I want to dig anyway
 reCurse: CG-style constraints
 reCurse: Not blundering so far...
 reCurse: I'm surprised
 jacek: you?
 reCurse: lol
 dbdr: I guess even inside the constraints, there must be a NN size / search speed tradeoff
 reCurse: touché
 reCurse: Yeah of course
 reCurse: Something that doesn't seem too looked at as well which I like
 jacek: usual CNN?
 reCurse: Yeah conv is life
 jacek: one hots are life
 jacek: did you miss the cgzero craze
 reCurse:&#160;?

 jacek: now 10+ oware bots are NN
 reCurse: Eh...
 reCurse: I don't mean to be disrespectful but I'm a bit... disappointed? Not sure.
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: marchete lowered the bar of entry I suppose
 Wontonimo: oO also
 Wontonimo: i think it's fab that marchete shared and so many people tried.  it's a huge cost of entry, and this made it a lot more accessible  to many
 reCurse: I don't mean to diss the effort or say it's not great
 reCurse: Just a very personal feeling
 MSmits: I know why
 MSmits: it took you a lot of effort to make everything work
 MSmits: and now other people can get a jumpstart you did not get
 MSmits: it's a very human response imho
 reCurse: No it's not even really that
 MSmits: hmm ok
 reCurse: It's kind of robbing you of the reward for the effort you put?
 MSmits: yours or the ones using it?
 reCurse: You can't have as much motivation to get something to work if you can already see the end result
 reCurse: Speaking for myself anyway
 Astrobytes: Valid point
 MSmits: sure, but something can be so hard to put off almost everyone
 reCurse: That's why I speak for myself
 reCurse: I'm sure for most it's great
 MSmits: I will probably use parts of it sometime in the next few weeks
 reCurse: But the presence of a solution would probably have killed my motivation if I hadn't started
 Astrobytes: You'd already started though right MSmits? Prior to this
 MSmits: well just getting the endgame book
 MSmits: 36 seed book is on my drive
 MSmits: finished
 MSmits: uses like 40 GB total :P
 Astrobytes: Dearie me
 MSmits: still havent started on the meta mcts for 37-48, got sidetracked by D&amp;B
 MSmits: it's such a cool game&#160;:)
 reCurse: Marchete if you read this don't take it the wrong way
 Marchete: I don't, and I knew you thought that way
 Marchete: I've heard having this conversation like 1 year ago
 reCurse: Ok just making sure no hard feelings
 reCurse: It's great work really
 reCurse: Just makes me sad for some stupid reason&#160;:)
 Marchete: don't worry
 Marchete: It's OK, you are more competitive than me
 reCurse: Why is 2 nodes still winning
 reCurse: I'm sad now
 reCurse: I'll blame lack of sleep or something
 Marchete: enjoy parenthood
 reCurse: Thanks
 Marchete: and I mean it, even with sleep deprivation
 reCurse: Oh it's 3 nodes (&lt;=) that's why
 Marchete: you'll miss those moments, they grow up FAST
 jacek: 3 nodes vs 2 nodes?
 reCurse: No 3 nodes is still bullying me
 reCurse: Yeah that's what everyone keeps saying hehe
 reCurse: Took 3 months off for that reason among others
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. There's babyCurse&#160;! :o
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, congrats man! Enjoy every moment&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: gg
 reCurse: Thanks
 Manchi_o6o7: How can I check integer overflow in C
 martinpapa69: what is the operation you want to check&#160;?
 reCurse: 1 coffee &gt; 3 nodes
 Astrobytes: hehehe&#160;:)
 reCurse: This is fun
 reCurse: It baffles me how a small net with no search holds its own
 jacek: how small though
 reCurse: :zipper_mouth:
 reCurse: It should fit on CG but barely
 jacek: and what was the data, stockfish trainer?
 reCurse: No I used CCRL
 reCurse: So a few millions of engine games
 reCurse: No filter
 reCurse: I didn't think SL would work that well and yet
 reCurse: So much stuff to try now
 jacek: hmph
 reCurse:&#160;?
 jacek: nothing~

 reCurse:&#160;:)
 Xezs2774: where can i report a bug on here?
 reCurse: Forum or #bug-report on discord
 Astrobytes: Or triage it here beforehand
 BlaiseEbuth: Yet another bug in temperature, I guess...&#160;:(
 FalINTOblivion0112: hey blaiseeburth
 FalINTOblivion0112: how do you optimize mean max
 FalINTOblivion0112: the contest
 Astrobytes: Just use True AI and make it go brrrr
 nulte: AVX
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't
 FalINTOblivion0112: i make init
 FalINTOblivion0112: and create random crap
 nulte: init?
 FalINTOblivion0112: i initiate classes of cars
 nulte: meanmax might be one of the harder games to make a decent AI
 nulte: I never tried it though
 FalINTOblivion0112: yeah
 FalINTOblivion0112: it is very hard actually
 FalINTOblivion0112: but im doing well
 Wontonimo: have you tried GA for meanmax?
 FalINTOblivion0112: what is GA
 reCurse: garbage algorithm
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes i have
 FalINTOblivion0112: that is the algorithm im using right now
 FalINTOblivion0112: reapers desecrate
 Wontonimo: Genetic Algorithm
 Wontonimo: Genetic Algos are pretty good at many things.  If you'd like some tips, let me know
 Wontonimo: PM if you'd like FalINTOblivion0112
 FalINTOblivion0112: thank you man
 FalINTOblivion0112: but generic algorithms are decent
 Wontonimo: what algo are you currently using in meanmax&#160;?
 FalINTOblivion0112: distance thing
 FalINTOblivion0112: am i even using an algorithm
 nulte: are you doing any multi Wontonimo?
 FalINTOblivion0112: dunno man
 Wontonimo: i've been lazy lately nulte.  Tron and C4 are probably next and shouldn't be much work at all porting what i have in other multis
 Wontonimo: i really do like what Marchete did with NNs, and it so that is also high on my list to replicate
 Wontonimo: i'm curious how i'd translate that into convolution for square/hex board games
 Wontonimo: within the constraints of CG
 martinpapa69: you worry about the codesize constraints&#160;?
 reCurse: This meme needs to die&#160;:)
 jacek: what meme
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: The codesize 
 jacek: it will die if they get rid of codesize limit
 reCurse: It seems everyone's first thought of NNs on CG is worrying about size when it's the easiest obstacle
 reCurse: A bit like worrying about O3 when pragmas are available
 jacek: it is a problem with one-hots. the peasant convs guys won't get it
 AllYourTrees: lol
 reCurse: You're just not trying enough&#160;:)
 reCurse: Besides I did NNs on CG for over a year without convs
 martinpapa69: I'm pretty sure tho, that there must be a better way to encode, and input your data, than one-hot encoding, in a game like oware. 
 reCurse: Most likely
 Westicles: Is it possible to make a contribution where you penalize based on codesize?
 reCurse: Yes, it's called code golf
 Westicles: I don't mean clashes...
 reCurse: Me neither
 Westicles: Then I don't get it
 reCurse: Oh my bad for some reason I thought the SDK allowed it
 reCurse: Guess not
 Astrobytes: 'platform limitation' I guess
 Westicles: Hmm, seems like it should be possible.  Something along the lines of CGFunge Prime
 reCurse: Well I guess you could print the source code on first turn and have the referee somehow compile it and... :P
 Astrobytes: Definitely your territory Westicles :D
 Westicles: Well, it is very possible I am too dumb to figure out the SDK
 MSmits: yeah it works for CGFunge, so it's possible
 MSmits: look at eulers code i guess
 Astrobytes: If any past experience is to be taken at value I do believe you have this down Westicles :D
 Westicles: Ha, well thanks Astrobytes for the vote of confidence :P
 MSmits: +1
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 MSmits: I think I almost cracked the D&amp;B secret
 MSmits: I feel it
 reCurse: You didn't use enough bass?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: well played reCurse
 MSmits: that went woosh&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: You forgot to make a cut around 100hz for the kick to get through?
 MSmits: still woosh
 MSmits: does this have something to do with me living under a rock?
 MSmits: it's not that kind of rock though

 MSmits: oo
 MSmits: ack, please go back to rickrolling me instead
 Astrobytes: Dude please. That is A Tune.
 MSmits: giving me A headache
 reCurse: ngl it's kinda meh :p
 Astrobytes: I picked it as a mid-point between current DnB and emergence of DnB from jungle tbh
 Astrobytes: It kicks at a rave though, trust me
 reCurse: Prefer when there's more melody shrug
 Astrobytes: Ah see, this is neuro stuff, you want the liquid
 reCurse: ...sure
 Astrobytes: No really, liquid dnb is more melodic
 reCurse: If there's something giving me a headache it's music categorization
 Astrobytes: There's nothing worse, I agree. Especially when it's sub-genres of genres
 Astrobytes: and sometimes sub-genres of sub-genres
 Astrobytes: But hey, neither you nor me made those categories
 reCurse: I'll just leave that to spotify to figure out what I want to hear
 Astrobytes: Check stuff on Hospital/Hospitality label, should be decent
 Astrobytes: Good Looking Records,  Soul:R etc
 nulte: spotify sometimes finds good musics
 Astrobytes: Doesn't for me. I'm a fussy f***er
 reCurse: Sure thanks, just gonna say d&amp;b not that high on my favorite genres though
 nulte: not even if you pick a song and choose play from this song?
 nulte: play radio*
 Astrobytes: Nor mine these days, but I have a rich past history with it&#160;;)
 MSmits: I like celtic music
 reCurse: Play radio kinda sucks, but when you start building a playlist with a few songs not too far from each other you get pretty good suggestions in my experience
 Astrobytes: I like digging for music myself (when I have time)
 Astrobytes: MSmits: which kind? Quite a few Celtic nations
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwuQ6UHMQg&amp;t=864s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwuQ6UHMQg&amp;t=864s</a>
 MSmits: i like many of those 
 MSmits: they use a lot of music like that in games as well. There's a famous skyrim mod that just uses music from this composer I believe
 Astrobytes: I prefer my Celtic music along the lines of (it won't rip your ears off btw):<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlmOliCPMZ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlmOliCPMZ8</a>
 MSmits: the music is fine. I don't need the singing though
 Astrobytes: You like that Disney woman
 MSmits: yeah that's one of the few where I like the singing
 nulte: is the bot finally doing something
 nulte: or just luck
 MSmits: which bot?
 nulte: mine, breakthrough
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure what I did to mine tbh
 MSmits: oh ok
 Astrobytes: Looks good man!
 nulte: thanks
 nulte: I made it solve sooner
 nulte: I fee like my eval still has  a long way to go though
 Astrobytes: That worked well either way
 nulte: yeah
 nulte: top 10 is close now
 Astrobytes: yeah, good work&#160;:)
 nulte: my goal is to beat robo bot 1 match
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: C4 vengeance
 MSmits: code a meta mcts, put in his moves, let it run for a week :P
 Astrobytes: lol the SmitsiHax
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but really, don't do that :P robo doesn't deserve it
 Astrobytes: oard
 Astrobytes: woops
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: wrong text area
 MSmits: dont paste your bot here :P
 nulte: I think i might have better chances if I improve the eval
 Astrobytes: no pasting lol
 nulte: i only want to beat him 1 time
 nulte: i dont want to take his rank
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: well considering how deterministic his bots are, beating him once, may mean beating him many times
 MSmits: but beating him once is the hard part :P
 Astrobytes: And the awful thing is that they'll just retrain on you and you're screwed. But this is where MSmits comes in with his Grimoires 
 MSmits: yeah, well that works up to a point and only in some games
 Astrobytes: True
 MSmits: would be really easy to do in C4, harder in BT
 MSmits: I mean in C4 it's even strong, nontargeted. Just letting the algo figure it out for itself. The statespace is that small
 Astrobytes: I didn't realise BT was so deep tbh
 MSmits: combined with mcts being that good
 MSmits: BT has way more branching than C4
 Astrobytes: Yeah ofc, but strategy-wise I mean
 MSmits: BT is a very pretty game imho. It makes me sad that I can't write a better bot fo rit
 nulte: I hate writing eval
 Astrobytes: it's a great game, I totally love and hate it
 MSmits: well I like experimenting with eval features, but i hate fitting the numbers
 Astrobytes: I like seeing how it changes the behaviour, you gotta pick the right features first though
 MSmits: yeah and I never really succeeded at that with BT
 MSmits: it seems messy because of complex interaction between pieces
 MSmits: it's what I ran into when trying to eval br2k compared to eval of csb
 MSmits: at least csb has some low hanging fruit when it comes to eval
 Astrobytes: Yeah, br2k had me at a wall. Must get back to that at some point, was a cool game
 MSmits: yeah thats why i mentioned it. It also felt like a pretty game, but  I also failed at that, relatively speaking
 MSmits: I got stuck right before last boss
 Astrobytes: Did better than me D:
 Astrobytes: * :D
 nulte: im done
 nulte: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/570865902">https://www.codingame.com/replay/570865902</a>

 MSmits: gj!
 MSmits: you beat the boss
 Astrobytes: Nice sneaky win there&#160;:)
 nulte: oh he didnt update his bt bot yet
 nulte: he is gonna crush my dreams
 MSmits: but he'll be polite and nice about it
 Astrobytes: Alright I'm out fortoday, still logged in but don't expect a reply :P
 Astrobytes: Goodnight/afternoon/evening everyone

 GrantSan: lol
 GrantSan: lol
 GrantSan: hold up how do you know the position of the checkpoints in coders strike back
 nulte: you need to store them&#160;:/
 nulte: and keep track of it I guess
 nulte: Im not sure if checkpoint id is given on lower leageus
 nulte: leagues*
 FriendlyKh: in lower league
 FriendlyKh: it automaticly change the checkpoint if the pod touch the checkpoint
 FriendlyKh: but from the gold league 
 FriendlyKh: it gives you id of the checkpoint
 FriendlyKh: so you have to change it by yourself
 prINTint: can someone help me with my school project
 prINTint: :confounded: plese
 Wontonimo: nope, but i can help you with something on this site
 prINTint: @Wontonmino no issues
 prINTint: can someone help me with my school project
 prINTint: it is simply to write source code for shopping software
 nulte: im sure you can do it

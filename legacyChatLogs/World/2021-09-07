 XanderGaldones: what's up!
 derjack: ttt eh
 mailbox: this website is good for learning but def urges you to do bad practices lol
 mailbox: i almost named my variable "a" when i was programming normally lol
 derjack: codegolf isnt for good practices
 derjack: heck most stuff here isnt for good practices. my code here is hackatonish
 Uljahn: this site is about learning dirty hacks :smiley:
 mailbox: mhm lol
 Uljahn: e.g. how to fit NN in 100k or to use bitboards and AVX
 derjack: bitboards arent dirty :o
 mailbox: i mean, when are you going to need to micro 1 byte
 mailbox: 10 bytes even
 derjack: bitboards are for speed. NN quantiozation for speed also, due to cache coherence and whatnot. but normally they would be encapsulated in nice classes etc.

 ProCoder03: What is an optimal time in space race&#160;??
 ProCoder03: *search race
 ProCoder03: and what is that collision time in it&#160;??
 derjack: probably lower than 1st
 ProCoder03: :unamused:
 TimothyAlexisVass: Why did this stop further code?&#160;:\
 ProCoder03:&#160;???
 MiyamuraIzumi: 492180 Points
 TimothyAlexisVass: if(row.split``.every(c=&gt;c=='#')){b=true;break;}
 TimothyAlexisVass: even if it evaluated to false, the code after didn't run...
 TimothyAlexisVass: Will it break if row is empty or something?
 ProCoder03: MiyamuraIzumi, What are you talking abt..... CG points...
 chop-chop: wrap into try{}catch(e){/*you-code*/}
 chop-chop: probably there are some error

 C26_1: hello
 C26_1: I'm gonna ask a question
 derjack: hm?
 C26_1: Does using a lot of variables make you bad at programming language
 derjack: no
 derjack: sometimes you need a very lot of variables
 C26_1: I don't have exprience with any real work, but at least knowing some coding
 C26_1: Cool
 C26_1: Thank you for answer my question
 C26_1: At least if you do some simple code, you don't need a lot of them
 C26_1: For example:
 Uljahn: just make sure your variable names are meaningful and you're good
 pikachutiya: i honestly find it better if there are multiple clearly defined variables, keeping in mind that you only use variables when its absolutely necessart
 pikachutiya: necessary*
 derjack: oh my that turtle is about smits in c4
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: Im gonna copy my post from Reddit (Bc I'm inventing Base-Divide notation)
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/55bdf0df-adec-4506-9a76-d60ce3c7e100">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/55bdf0df-adec-4506-9a76-d60ce3c7e100</a>
 C26_1: Oops, the text is so large that it is meaningful to paste them as pastebin
 derjack: any question?
 C26_1: So I'm inventing something called Base-Divide Notation (Or you can called it as Base-Power Notation bc it's related)
 C26_1: the things that it'll do is store a very very large to some small way
 C26_1: large numbers*
 C26_1: The notation in general is:
 C26_1: (n1,n2,n3,.....,nk)b
 C26_1: where k is the length of the notation, and b is the base
 C26_1: Note to know here:
 C26_1: 1. You cannot have a digit in number that is larger to the base (EX: 1234, no digits in 1234 is larger the number 10 - the base)
 C26_1: 2. You only use that notation for some very large and unusual base like base 13, base 41, base 100 
 C26_1: 3. Just to know, writing wrong digits in notation isn't "wrong" but to keep base analysis clear, you just have to do that
 darkhorse64: ProCoder03: what do you mean by optimal&#160;? Shortest&#160;? Something you can reach with a moderate effort&#160;? The collision time is the time at which you reach a checkpoint during your turn. A turn duration is 1s
 C26_1: 4. You can plugin real numbers in digits of the notation, as long as the digits smaller than the base, and you know the converting formula from any base to base 10
 C26_1: Ok, done the introduces
 C26_1: Back to the conversation
 C26_1: We write the notation with the open bracket first "(" , with the following "|" for every digits in the numbers. After that, you use the closed bracket ")" to close the number, and finally plug the base as a number
 C26_1: For example:
 C26_1: (|20|31|42|)56
 C26_1: Or
 C26_1: (|12|32|45|)100
 C26_1: Ok, done the notation
 C26_1: How to convert the "number" in base "b" to base 10 for our human-purpose reading
 darkhorse64: You have a clash of code subject with this notation
 C26_1: @darkhorse64, what clash tho?
 darkhorse64: short time span (5 min) problem solving
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>
 C26_1: formula for converting base "b" to base 10: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://slidetodoc.com/beyond-base-10-nondecimal-based-number-systems-what/">https://slidetodoc.com/beyond-base-10-nondecimal-based-number-systems-what/</a>
 darkhorse64: You can make contributions to CoC too
 C26_1: Ok
 C26_1: But can I typing the text fully in this chat
 C26_1: I'll do now
 C26_1: So back to notation converting
 darkhorse64: A wall of text will be turned automatically to a pastebin
 C26_1: It just as easy as doing carry sums in elementary schools so don't worry if you scare math or hardcore one
 C26_1: Example this number:
 C26_1: (|13|29|14|)30
 C26_1: You want to converting that number into base 10 right?
 C26_1: I don't know the general step, so I'm just writing step for this EX, just to so if you can figure out
 C26_1: Step 1:
 C26_1: Divide 14/30: remainder: 14, carry sums: 0
 C26_1: Step 2:
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: That's the wrong step
 C26_1: Sorry
 C26_1: Step 1: Compute 13*30^2 + 29*30^1 + 14*30^0
 C26_1: Done
 C26_1: The result is 12584
 C26_1: Sorry again, Carry sums and remainder is in part 2: Rewriting the wrong notation to the right one
 C26_1: Part 2: Rewriting the wrong notation to the right one
 C26_1: So, there are only 2 ways to writing the wrong notation, either writing less symbols as it needed, or if the digit is larger or equal to the base
 MiyamuraIzumi: nice haha
 C26_1: Example
 chop-chop: how to open such links<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fcf34813-7376-4c9b-bafa-3179f3846e2f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fcf34813-7376-4c9b-bafa-3179f3846e2f</a>
 C26_1: (|30
 C26_1: (|30|12|14|)21
 C26_1: This is a wrong  notation
 MiyamuraIzumi: just text alot
 C26_1: We need to rewrite it, as we need base analysis to be neutral
 MiyamuraIzumi: chop-chop
 MiyamuraIzumi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f63e7b4f-ade1-4af3-9021-9e575de6f0b3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f63e7b4f-ade1-4af3-9021-9e575de6f0b3</a>
 C26_1: Step 1: Compute 14/21, remainder = 14, carry sums = 0
 C26_1: Step 2: Compute 12/21, remainder = 12, carry sums = 0
 C26_1: Step 3: Compute 30/21, remainder = 9, carry sums = 1
 C26_1: Step 4: Compute 1/21, remainder = 1, carry sums = 0. End digits
 C26_1: Done
 C26_1: Rewrite (|30|12|14|)21 as (|1|9|12|14|)21 
 C26_1: So that's it
 C26_1: End of the notation conversation 
 C26_1: Note: You only need use that notation if you stored a super large number ino small numbers
 chop-chop: C26_1, it looks interesting!
 chop-chop: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca2e9530-afe4-4a92-86dd-43bd1033372c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca2e9530-afe4-4a92-86dd-43bd1033372c</a>
 C26_1: In computer science, you can use that notation as an array, where the last number in array is the base, all other are just digits
 C26_1: If you ever use my notation in math paper or the other way around, just writing this line of text: "The Base-Divide Notation is invented by user C26_1 in codingame.com"
 C26_1: I don't need (money, or credits in general)
 C26_1: Soooooo....
 C26_1: The ends.

 derjack: most decent IDEs allow for debugging
 derjack: on codingame, you can print values to stderr
 Lanfeustdedeux: Oh, ok thanks
 derjack: what language
 Lanfeustdedeux: I'm using python, but I guess you just meant to use print("....", file=sys.stderr)
 Lanfeustdedeux: I realised that there was an comment that was automatically generated that said we could use that for debugging x)
 Lanfeustdedeux: I should have RTFM as we say
 derjack: nah, its always better to ask in chat than to read the statement :v

 JacobTheCoder: hi:)
 KalamariKing: hey!
 MrBest: hey THERE!

 JacobTheCoder: fair enough
 JacobTheCoder: havent really tried it

 GoodGuss: I want to learn to write code, but I think I am not smart enough
 Lord_Binary: everyone can learn to write code, but don't expect it to be fast and easy to learn
 Lord_Binary: as long as you put in the time and effort, I am sure you will learn&#160;:)
 automata: I am playing clash of code after not playing it for a very long time. People seem not to share their code mostly these days. Maybe it is just my impression, but it used to be very collaborative back in the day. Top players used to share and now it is the opposite.
 Wontonimo: GoodGuss, learning to code is like learning to read.  It takes daily effort over a long time.  And like reading, it can be fun if you choose
 Wontonimo: maybe play the challenges <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a> instead.  There you can see lots of shared solutions
 Wontonimo: Lord_Binary ^^
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry, that was meat for automata
 C26_1: Does fast code rely on programming language (like C++ vs Python) or Algorithms (Like Binary Search or Linear Search)
 Wontonimo: both
 C26_1: Ok
 C26_1: I need to learn C++ quick
 C26_1: Because I knew that C++ is a lot faster than Python
 Wontonimo: if you have to use a language, then you can improve speed using efficient data structures 
 C26_1: But its syntax is horribly hard to read or even translate it to Python
 C26_1: What a cool trae off after all
 Wontonimo: I'm not trying to talk you out of learning C++, but why do you want code to be a lot faster?
 C26_1: trade off*
 Uljahn: how fast do you need your code to be? in most cases python is more than enough
 C26_1: um ok
 Wontonimo: +1 Uljahn
 C26_1: At least if runtime is not larger than 1 seconds for any function
 automata: Wontonimo, my point was that people should share their code. Especially if they win.
 Uljahn: it all depends on data though
 struct: learn logic first
 Wontonimo: +1 ^^
 struct: you dont need to speed if you dont know how to code
 struct: dont need speed*
 C26_1: @struct, good quote
 automata: C++ is not a lot faster than Python per se
 struct: if you are a begginer
 DamCoder: But u need "Speed" - if u want to code faster :o
 automata: But to be constructive, you can use Cython 
 C26_1: I mean programming language are for human reading after all, so don't use list comprehension or if-trick in python if you want your code need to be readable
 C26_1: I have a idea
 C26_1: if you make your code to be fast and also readable to your team, then 
 Uljahn: i use numpy and numba when i want my python to go faster
 Wontonimo: Here is an example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-lucky-number">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-lucky-number</a>A brute force attack on this problem will time out for any language.  My plain python solution that uses some logic takes 0.3 milliseconds
 struct: i use c++ when i want my c++ to go faster&#160;:)
 Uljahn: you mean pragmas
 C26_1: Make your function store in 1 file where you do the readable one and send it to your team, and make the fastest one to your own
 C26_1: Then use fastest function to public if you ever post it in Github
 derjack: or use OOP, encapsulate parts of codes into functions and classes. if there is critical part of code that needs to best fast but not readable, then only that part will be unreadable, but you can still use comments there
 struct: if you want readable code use perl
 derjack: and avoid using structs ~

 Bobbelo: Hey guys, when you are doing the practices, is there any way to see what the input is for the test cases?
 Bobbelo: Its really annoying that I can't find it because knowing what the inputs are will make it easier to debug
 Bobbelo: Nevermind, found it
 xspeedasx: there's a "list" button to the right of TEST CASES | CUSTOM |
 Bobbelo: thanks speed
 xspeedasx: too slow :D but np
 xspeedasx: i like to take the inputs and use them to solve it in IDE then just copy-paste the code back to CG
 xspeedasx: if its a puzzle
 Bobbelo: Would there be a way for me to ask for help here? is it okay if I just paste code? 
 xspeedasx: use pastebin :D

 kumabearr:&#160;:)
 struct: Bobbelo
 Bobbelo: Yeah?
 struct: You turn negative into possible
 struct: and then save it has negative
 struct: your comparison is always checking the positive value vs negative
 Bobbelo: What?
 chop-chop: how to mention some one?
 struct: if unsign_temp &lt; closest_temp:
 struct: This part
 kumabearr: chop-chop 
 struct: if last temperature was -12
 struct: you stored -12
 Bobbelo: My goodnes.
 Bobbelo: Thank you so much
 struct: you understood?
 Bobbelo: yeah, but now I'm completely lost on how to fix it
 struct: do you know abs?
 xspeedasx: suggest to have another closest_temp but with a sign. ala closest_real_temp and assign t to it when you assign unsign_temp to closest_temp
 Bobbelo: I did it! :D

 Lanfeustdedeux: Hey guys! Do you know if we can battle a friend?
 Lanfeustdedeux: In "Coders Strike back" sorry
 Lanfeustdedeux: The game with the pods racing x)
 Wontonimo: yeah, if they are in the same league
 Wontonimo: you can remove the boss and then add them
 Wontonimo: you can then share the replay with them
 struct: only if they are on top 1k of the league though
 Wontonimo: can't you search by name struct?
 struct: no
 struct: it will still only get based on the 1k
 Wontonimo: Lanfeustdedeux - it looks like your bot is broken and isn't reading the new data for gold league.  You can get the new template by clicking the circle arrow in the upper right of the IDE
 Wontonimo: then you can get your old code from history and copy it in where it is expected.
 Wontonimo: you will immediately jump 1000 ranks just by having working code that simply flies directly to the next checkpoint
 JacobTheCoder: hi
 JacobTheCoder: im new to coding and want to know the best way and what type (C++, JS, etc.) to code
 struct: both have their uses
 JacobTheCoder: heh
 JacobTheCoder: what would be the best for like addons or whatever
 struct: what do you mean by addons?
 JacobTheCoder: lemme rephrase that lol, for games
 JacobTheCoder: so like say for instance shooters, car games ya know?
 struct: both work
 struct: js for mostly browser
 JacobTheCoder: okay
 struct: c++ for desktop 
 JacobTheCoder: ahhh
 JacobTheCoder: where is the best place to start with no experiance
 JacobTheCoder: experience
 Wontonimo: there is a really good youtube channel called "the coding train" 
 Wontonimo: he does some really good intro to programming videos
 Wontonimo: he has over 1000 instructional videos on programming
 JacobTheCoder: cant really watch it rn cause im in school but ill watch it when i get home
 struct: I remember seeing some of his videos long ago
 JacobTheCoder: so like is he #1recommended?
 Wontonimo: if you have zero experience programming, you can play with coding concepts using <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">https://scratch.mit.edu/</a> 
 JacobTheCoder: ah
 JacobTheCoder: gtg 
 Wontonimo: that is a fun way of starting to visualize coding structures
 JacobTheCoder: seeya
 JacobTheCoder: yeah
 Wontonimo: later

 Pinggo: im didnt go to college too
 Pinggo: too poor eheheh
 struct: You dont need to go to college to learn js
 struct: First challenge to learning js is learning how to google
 struct: Then you find a tutorial that suits you
 struct: Some people like videos, some like books, some learn by doing
 JacobTheCoder: hi
 JacobTheCoder: im back

 struct: are you aiming for legend?
 Wontonimo: i've got a major bug and i also want to switch to minimax or mcts.  those two things combined i'm confident will get me to legend in tron
 struct: do you use bitboards?
 Wontonimo: not yet.  i'm going to see if i can get away without it for now
 jacek: wgat game
 Wontonimo: it's a large board with multiple players.  makes life simple to just use uint8_t
 Wontonimo: Tron&#160;!
 struct: yeah
 zacdave: hello world
 struct: Olá mundo
 Wontonimo: and if you can get away with not saving the board, then it can be mostly all in L1 cache anyway
 struct: should still fit in L1
 Wontonimo: i was thinking DFS implementation of Minimax with iterative deepening.  Are you working on tron anymore and what's your plan?
 struct: no
 struct: I only have been working on "dumb" games

 eulerscheZahl: no
 WWFYMN:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: say it again and I'll kick you
 WWFYMN: sad
 eulerscheZahl: i had already typed the kick, still in my clipboard
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: this dude is worser than me 
 WWFYMN: lol
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: and i did ALOT of bad stuff
 WWFYMN: not as bad as a certain failed artist?
 eulerscheZahl: so, this yare contest...hard to test your bot when there are only 3 bots to play against. and other players only if they are online at the same time as you
 struct: whats the contest euler?
 Astrobytes: Say what?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: well im in art class rn
 struct: focus on class
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: cant
 Astrobytes: or we'll kick you
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/d1/otqgv31hz2p3">https://yare.io/d1/otqgv31hz2p3</a>that game is running live right now struct
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: OKAY OKAY!
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: we're doing alleys
 Astrobytes: Hm. Somewhat annoying situation euler
 eulerscheZahl: and it's more of a heuristic contest than a simulation. so you have to cover those corner cases yourself
 Astrobytes: Kinda surprised you're bothering with it
 struct: 0.6 ethereum 
 struct: o.o
 struct: thats 10k $
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, not bad. and only 30 players qualified for the finals
 struct: When does contest end?
 Astrobytes: Oh right.
 eulerscheZahl: you can't join anymore
 eulerscheZahl: and $10k?
 eulerscheZahl: last i checked it was about 2k
 struct: ah sorry
 struct: yeah
 struct: i had in brazilian currency
 struct: sorry
 struct: Similar $
 Astrobytes: Still, wouldn't sniff at 2K
 struct: but has an R before
 eulerscheZahl: tbh that prize money is my main motivation right now
 struct: i was shocked when i saw 18k
 struct: gl euler
 Astrobytes: Reais
 Astrobytes: (the R)
 struct: 1800€ is a good prize
 Astrobytes: about £1500
 eulerscheZahl: not like i really need the money. but i've never grabbed such a big prize before
 Astrobytes: So if you win you'll be donating it to charity then :P
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: im lookin for a alley that looks very dirty
 Astrobytes: I'll kick you into one if you don't stop talking bollocks
 Wontonimo: talk about coding, stay on topic, be respectful 
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: okay, how do i code a alley into a coding thing
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: okay im done joking around, ill do my class
 struct: Whats the reason for both players having to be online though?
 Astrobytes: Poor design choices I suspect.
 eulerscheZahl: it's a semi-bot contest actually
 eulerscheZahl: you can edit your code while the game is running
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes: interesting...
 eulerscheZahl: but i have better things to do than babysitting my bot for a full 2 weeks tournament
 struct: So write a bot that writes a bot
 struct: :p
 struct: But yeah
 struct: doesnt seem fun
 eulerscheZahl: i just have other things to do. like my normal job. and doing real life hobbies
 Astrobytes: Football and catching mice?
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 eulerscheZahl: the mouse escaped again
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: useless cat
 Astrobytes: Some cats have that instinct, some don't. And when they don't - they *really* don't.
 MONIGMA: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: at least I managed to scrape replays from yare. So I can reproduce a certain frame offline without submitting a new bot and hoping that the same situations occurs
 eulerscheZahl: my cat is just old (16 years)
 eulerscheZahl: there were times when she brought 2 mice in a single night
 Astrobytes: awww, she's an old lady!
 eulerscheZahl: and released them in my room
 MONIGMA: That cat has some energy
 Astrobytes: Great when they do things like that.
 eulerscheZahl: she liked those rainy nights when the mice had to leave their holes
 MONIGMA: YEah until they kill the mouse then drop it
 MONIGMA: ON YOUR LAP
 Astrobytes: Birds flapping around the house, half dead rats squirming across the floor, mice with 3 legs hopping around
 eulerscheZahl: once there was a mouse living in my shoe and I didn't notice at first
 MONIGMA: YUK
 eulerscheZahl: was full of cat food and mouse poop, had to throw it away
 Astrobytes: lol, not a frequently worn shoe then :D
 MONIGMA:

 Astrobytes: Yes.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: im already done with my class

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: oh it worked?
 eulerscheZahl: much better than astro's value
 Illedan: Yeah his value is bad
 Astrobytes: shh
 Astrobytes: Stop mocking my value.
 Illedan: It is the distance between his furthest wizard and my goal for where I want to defend :P
 Astrobytes: Well if you said that I'd have given a sensible number :P
 Illedan: Which would be?
 Astrobytes: 0.785
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: duck
 eulerscheZahl: mocking such a value, hmm :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: should I write and implement an interface for this case?
 eulerscheZahl: and do I really have to mock it?
 Astrobytes: Not that kind of mocking.
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 Illedan: Always mock
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: Mock the cut too
 Illedan: then mock the mock
 Astrobytes: And everything becomes a mockery of itself?

 Astrobytes: It's very nice though, he's done a damn good job
 eulerscheZahl: it took me 1 or 2 days to get the rolling animation working as expected for dice duel. these things really mess with your brain
 eulerscheZahl: and he combined pixi + three.js
 eulerscheZahl: while I just deleted pixi entirely
 Astrobytes: Yeah rotational stuff gets a little unwieldy in 3D at times.
 Astrobytes: It's really rather good though, I am impressed.
 eulerscheZahl: the nasty part is that you have to rotate around the internal axis of a die while still looking from an external perspective
 Bobbelo: @eulerscheZahlThanks for letting me know.Also I'm fairly new at programming, and I thought I had at least a foot in the basics until I started doing the simple exercises you guys provide XD. It's been quite reassuring when I finally get past them though. I'm really enjoying the feeling of finally finishing one of them. (Not being stuck on them though XD)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm impressed too. I wasn't sure if he's going to make it going by his questions on discord
 eulerscheZahl: how did that not turn into a pastebin?

 eulerscheZahl: there's a char limit too
 Astrobytes: char limit not exceeded clearly
 eulerscheZahl: congrats on making progress Bobbelo
 eulerscheZahl: the first steps are always the hardest

 ja_fica: makes a big differenece
 jolindien: no evaluation function&#160;?

 jolindien: what is the idea to find quickly winning moves (killer moves)?
 struct: jolindien so you dont make a move that make opp win
 jolindien: i mean with bitboards
 struct: darkhorse64 your pieces and opp pieces
 struct: I think
 darkhorse64: make sense

 ja_fica: I forsee 4 positions at the same time using AVX
 struct: jolindien you want to know how to do it?
 jolindien: yes

 jolindien: ja_fica, I have re-written a sort of alpha0
 jolindien: thx struct, I think it's compute_winning_position() function
 ja_fica: struct is climbing the ladder like a boss xD
 struct: robo had too many battles vs me
 struct: it was like 50+ loses
 struct: My bot cant handle him at all
 struct: With my bitboard I had to use both shifts &lt;&lt; and shift &gt;&gt; to get winning position
 struct: if I only use &lt;&lt; it would make bits go out of range(?)
 ja_fica: I had to use MASK, rigth and left
 struct: yeah I also use masks
 jolindien: because of weird size
 ja_fica: jolindien have you tried to apply the same algo in UTTT?
 jolindien: not yet
 jolindien: I heard it's really hard
 AllYourTrees: i found C4 plenty hard lol
 struct: im still amazed that royale got 1st in yavalath
 jolindien: for me it was easier than oware
 struct: vs msmit book
 struct: and bot* his bot is strong
 jolindien: royale uses mcts&#160;?
 struct: im not sure
 struct: I just know its NN
 jolindien: he is high in many board games 
 AllYourTrees: hes using nn in c4
 jolindien: ahh ok
 ja_fica: my opening book only have 600 positions and it is enought
 ja_fica: I get to 15 plays book often, you can see it by my output
 struct: msmits book on yavalath is different
 struct: its a trap based game
 struct: so its a bit different from c4
 struct: maybe ill make a bot for it and submit a bos
 struct: so it can get potw
 Illedan: jolindien, did you get your Sogeti price?
 jolindien: no
 jolindien: Pb neither
 jolindien: (Pb4_)
 Illedan:&#160;:+1:
 Illedan: Mine was still shipping
 jolindien: don't have news
 jolindien: at all
 ja_fica: Why most top programmers in CG are from France?
 Illedan: CG is a france based company
 Illedan: Gotta start somewhere
 jolindien: french are smart
 Illedan: ^^
 ja_fica: it seems that way
 jolindien: and arrogant
 Remi_avec_un_i: hey&#160;! french people can read that&#160;! ^^
 ja_fica: The rate of French/Rest of the world is not even near Male/Female
 ja_fica: I guess its because of preferences
 ja_fica: BTW does anyone else found out that having a larger constant in UCT on MCTS is better in case of a better processor?
 ja_fica: winrate + CONSTANT * exploration
 jolindien: makes sense
 ja_fica: at night I submit my bot with 1.5, at day I submit at 1.4 because the server are busier, I guess I could test the processor speed on the precomputation in pick the constant from there
 jolindien: if you can spend more time in exploration
 jolindien: *if you have more time ...
 struct: let me see which NNs still have the problem of playing poorly vs bad bots
 struct: robo fixed it
 struct: for his
 jolindien: I have
 ja_fica: royale loses games at 35 plays
 struct: yes you have that problem jolindien
 jolindien: what is the solution&#160;?
 struct: I never asked robo
 jolindien: more exploration during training or inline&#160;?
 ja_fica: In the offline training play it against regular MTCS as well instead of just nn vs nn
 jolindien: I have to work on my UCT formula
 jolindien: I don't like PUCT
 jolindien: ja_fica, good idea
 ja_fica: you have the transition probabilities as well?
 jolindien: yes
 ja_fica: PUCT may fives some advantages as you spare time using the last layer vector in the NN to get the transition probabilities
 ja_fica: *may give
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/579355924">https://www.codingame.com/replay/579355924</a>
 struct: this is my bot with 1000. exploration factor
 struct: so its random
 struct: but still has the tree
 jolindien: problem with PUCT is that it gives too much priority to probabilities
 jolindien: with small nn, my probas are not so reliables
 ja_fica: yes you can add do a (x+p)/(1+x) to reduce the factor
 jolindien: oh bad loose
 struct: this one is worse
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/579356006">https://www.codingame.com/replay/579356006</a>
 AllYourTrees: i think its just that the number of tree expansions on CG is so high that with lower puct constants, PUCt converges really quickly
 jolindien: yeah I loose some games in 9 turn&#160;:)
 ja_fica: basicly, the training fase you cannot just play against your better nn
 jolindien: with an eval .98 ...
 ja_fica: it will be blind to other bad plays
 jolindien: it is the alpha0 algo
 jolindien: but here again it is designed for really performant nn
 AllYourTrees: its annoying how important the parameters for alphazero are
 struct: I cant remember if robo uses 16 bits or 8
 struct: I remember that he increased performance a lot
 struct: I think it was from 32 bits to 16 bits
 JacobTheCoder: hello
 struct: But not the weights
 struct: I dont know the term for it
 JacobTheCoder: is it possible to shit
 JacobTheCoder: WHAT
 AllYourTrees: quantization
 struct: Yeah I think that was it
 ja_fica: he uses 8 bits
 ja_fica: but floating 8 bits?
 ja_fica: or integer 8 bits...
 struct: well he uses avx I guess
 struct: So it must be int8
 ja_fica: has anyone though of using the neuralnetwork to just the UCT constant in each node?
 ja_fica: to ajust*
 ja_fica: it can only be trained using ARS but it seems worth it
 jolindien: I saw a paper on that
 jolindien: ARS&#160;?
 ja_fica: augmented random search
 ja_fica: it works better then drl for many tasks
 ja_fica: but like days difference better
 ja_fica: in openAI gym there is an environment, bipedalWalkerV2 where ARS is around 10x faster to learn then the usual deep reinforcement learning algorithms
 jolindien: would you have a ref&#160;?
 JacobTheCoder: i am super new to coding, dont know a single bit any suggestions on where i sohuld go?
 JacobTheCoder: should*
 ja_fica: I had a project to test it
 ja_fica: JacobTheCoder, start with the puzzles in you most comforting programming language
 ja_fica: I also developed a even faster version GRS - genetic random search

 jolindien: thx&#160;!
 _Royale: jolindien: MCTS with transpositions, NN with value/policy outputs (on Connect4, Othello, Yavalath and Oware)
 jolindien: hi _Royale&#160;!
 jolindien: transpositions&#160;?
 jolindien: do you mean for cache&#160;?
 jolindien: (for nn cache)&#160;?
 Chighsmith: how did you all learn to coode
 Chighsmith: code
 struct: by doing
 Chighsmith: here? or just working on projects?
 struct: I learned quite a bit here
 Chighsmith: i just seem a bit lost im a cs student and Im doing well in the classes it just seems hard to apply it
 struct: Yeah, its not very beginner friendly
 Chighsmith: I guess you feel bad at coding for a long time until one day you realize you don't lol
 struct: How long have you been a cs student?
 Chighsmith: about a year so im still intro but I dabbled in it in my last degree which brought me over to cs
 struct: With 1 year I think you should be able to solve some puzzles
 Chighsmith: Did you ever have a mentor or anybody to help you learn?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 Chighsmith: I'll give that one a go
 struct: no, but chat helps sometimes
 _Royale: jolindien: transpositions for the nodes so I can reuse already explored sub-trees
 Chighsmith: ahh gotcha
 jolindien: are you inspired by alpha0 too&#160;?
 _Royale: yes I did NN before but only for the value (like jacek)
 struct: is your breakthrough bot NN?
 _Royale: reCurse PM on last contest and Marchete motivated me to try harder with policy&#160;:-)
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 jolindien: gg
 _Royale: struct: on breakthrough I did logistic regression
 struct: thanks
 _Royale: and no policy
 jolindien: Marchete did you see alpha zero pseudo code&#160;?
 jolindien: (pseudocode.py in additional material)
 jolindien: it provides some parameters which are not in the paper
 _Royale: yeah more parameters to tune \o/
 jolindien: no policy ... so logistic regression on value&#160;?
 jolindien: -1 / 1
 jolindien: I thought policy was more important with a large branching factor ...
 Medoo: Good night everyone
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: In Vietnam, this should be day not night so.............
 Medoo: Well, its almost 4 am in here. Have a great day for you.
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: so 3 hours late
 C26_1: Can I post a challenge in here

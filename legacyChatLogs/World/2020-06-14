 eulerscheZahl: good morning AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: seems like the contest i stopped working on the contest i got a second
 -Gamma-: @AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: wait that would be a good idea to code and will that another one have the problem
 -Gamma-: this really is a bot...
 -Gamma-: oh it is
 eulerscheZahl: so is Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or any of the other
 eulerscheZahl: and AutomatonNN tends to ping me (was way worse in the past), see how he started a sentence with my nick a few messages above
 AutomatonNN: because i was trying to find a strategy for sure
 -Gamma-: yeah i see
 jacek: agade came back to oware :scream:
 LelouchVC2: This is the story of a girl

 AntiSquid: downvote followed by ctrl+W
 LelouchVC2: LMAO
 pb4: jacek&#160;: is he that scary&#160;? :japanese_ogre:
 eulerscheZahl: one called his avatar "creepy"
 eulerscheZahl: long ago, i don't remember who said it
 Agade: If you find out who that was, I'd like that information, for research purposes
 iPythonTrick: Guys
 iPythonTrick: I need help
 Gaurav.: what kind of help?
 iPythonTrick: 34    --&gt; 21
 iPythonTrick: 2  --&gt; 208
 iPythonTrick: I know but I can't apply iot
 iPythonTrick: it*
 -Gamma-: what....
 iPythonTrick: listen
 iPythonTrick: Input: 3 and 4
 iPythonTrick: Output: 21
 Gaurav.: 4*(4+3) and 2*(2+8)
 -Gamma-: okay
 iPythonTrick: Should I do it in python?
 -Gamma-: 7*4 is 28.....
 iPythonTrick: or java
 Gaurav.: 3*(4+3) my bad
 iPythonTrick: script
 Gaurav.: do it in python
 iPythonTrick: give me the code&#160;:/
 Gaurav.: a=int(input())b=int(input())print(a*(a+b))
 jrke: K
 iPythonTrick: WTF
 iPythonTrick: you genius
 iPythonTrick: omg
 Gaurav.: bruh XD
 iPythonTrick: How long have you been programming?
 Gaurav.: 2 years
 iPythonTrick: I see
 iPythonTrick: :D
 iPythonTrick: What languages are you good at?
 Gaurav.: c and python
 iPythonTrick: Oh
 iPythonTrick: C is complex
 Gaurav.: not really it is really fun to code in C
 eulerscheZahl: especially parsing strings
 Gaurav.: yup
 struct: ^
 -Gamma-: tf.... is happening 
 -Gamma-: oh okay
 iPythonTrick: how to find the sum of the mods of a list of numbers
 eulerscheZahl: "sum of mods"?
 Gaurav.:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: mod = modulo i guess
 eulerscheZahl: but still unclear
 iPythonTrick: You must find the sum of the mods of a list of numbers.Modular arithmetic refers to the remainder of the divide function. A mod B = the remainder of A/B.
 iPythonTrick: For example:5 mod 2 = 115 mod 6 = 3
 -Gamma-: .....
 struct: tot += a&#160;% b;
 iPythonTrick: oh wait
 Gaurav.: use the "%" modulo operator
 iPythonTrick: should I loop the list and calculate the modules?
 struct: yes
 Gaurav.: if u want to do it in python u can use list comprehension 
 iPythonTrick: I am using C#
 -Gamma-: then just use a simple loop
 eulerscheZahl: m = int(input())nums = map(int, input().split())print(sum(n%m for n in nums))
 Gaurav.: just loop over them and keep adding it to an accumulator 
 eulerscheZahl: python
 eulerscheZahl: how dare you using C# and calling yourself iPythonTrick
 iPythonTrick: idk
 -Gamma-: lol
 iPythonTrick: my old acc
 Astrobytes: That's the 'Trick' part you see euler
 iPythonTrick:&#160;:"""D
 iPythonTrick: euler, it's not working
 Gaurav.: lmao

 hearthewarsong: Is tehre any more link like this?
 iPythonTrick: It doesn't work euler
 eulerscheZahl: maths? do you mean matches?
 eulerscheZahl: it does iPythonTrick

 eulerscheZahl: all green with my code
 eulerscheZahl: seems that line 2 was added later
 eulerscheZahl: thus you have to read an additional line of input now
 struct: hearthe I think euler article is a good start
 iPythonTrick: damn I suck at programming
 iPythonTrick: &gt;_______________&lt;
 struct: I used it to write a C# program to get some stuff from API
 iPythonTrick: what was it called?
 struct: the problem is API is undocumented
 -Gamma-: just barycenters and pathfinding arent't enough for power of thor ep 2 right....
 eulerscheZahl: so the playground you linked shows you how to find the API calls yourself instead of listing one or two

 Mal30: nice catch, blanco nino
 Mal30: those "make the code as short as possible" are boring and a poor assessment of coding abilites (IMO)
 CorentinPETIT: I'm already struggling with level 2, i'm gonna get my butt kicked tommorow at my interview
 Gaurav.: its gonna be fine dude have faith in urself and index arrays starting at 0
 CorentinPETIT: Thanks man
 Uljahn: at least you'll get some experience with iterviews
 AntiSquid: well with that mindset you surely will CorentinPETIT
 eulerscheZahl: in Pascal you can decide the starting index of arrays on declaration
 eulerscheZahl: 0, 1, -42, 1337up to you where it starts
 JBM: they dropped that in perl
 Astrobytes: Raku &gt; perl 5
 JBM: they never had that in perl 6
 Astrobytes: Missed that one for your TvC
 JBM: well it's kind of specific
 Astrobytes: I admit I never used Raku/Perl 6, it didn't seem... appealing
 struct: Top 4 thales :p
 Rush_iam: Hello. I am newb and dealing with "Horse-racing Duals"... is there a way to get proccessing time my code took?
 Snef: MSmits are you here&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: if you are timing out, all you know is that it took more than 1s
 eulerscheZahl: for smaller testcases: the stopwatch equivalent in your language of choice
 Rush_iam: I didn't understood, didn't know how to approach it... So if I am not timed out - how to get exact execution time in "ms"&#160;?
 jrke: which lang you are Rush jam
 eulerscheZahl: you can't. your program will be terminated before finishing
 eulerscheZahl: but check the hints on the left
 Rush_iam: jrke, Python
 jrke: K
 jrke: i don't know about python so i can;t help you
 Rush_iam: jrke, there is a way for other language?
 jrke: if you are not timed out then you can check the execution time in ms
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/measure-execution-time-function-cpp/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/measure-execution-time-function-cpp/</a>
 jrke: for c++ ^
 jrke: just replace microsecond to milliseconds
 eulerscheZahl: obviously you can measure time in python too
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+measure+time">https://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+measure+time</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but as i pointed out earlier: your process will get killed before finishing. so you never reach the point where your program would print the total time
 Andrelamus: Will shortest mode ever be removed? probably not....
 Hankdane: Rush_jam, write a unit test for your function(s) and print out the time it takes for smaller samples.
 Hankdane: Or run your code in your own environment, so your process can run to completion.
 Rush_iam: Thanks, jrke, eulerscheZahl, Hankdane!
 jrke:&#160;:)
 Hans-Peter-Ingo: Can i write somebody directly a message?
 Uljahn: ye but only to ppl online
 eulerscheZahl: or you send a private message via forum. that even triggers an email notification
 Astrobytes: Agade's new Oware NN is pretty strong
 eulerscheZahl: how do you know it's a NN?
 Astrobytes: He told us a while ago, until recently his last submission was fixing something he'd messed up
 Astrobytes: Not sure what he's done this time
 Scarfield: AstroPlays <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG1yUs0ybys">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG1yUs0ybys</a>
 Scarfield: andrew white&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yo GuitarField, yes, I actually was in time today to pick up the link from chat. I see what you mean&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Excellent stuff, hadn't heard of him at all
 Scarfield: yea he is great, subbed to pierre yesterday&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, he's amazing
 Astrobytes: Oooh also check out Yvette Young, bit different but what a talent
 Astrobytes: Plays guitar like a piano, essentially
 Scarfield: wow and violin and sings, always nice with some new artists shoutouts&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, she's unreal
 Astrobytes: And yeah, absolutely
 darkhorse64: The top 3 at Othello are very strong. I am winless against each of them
 darkhorse64: and they keep on improving
 struct: What are you using darkhorse64 if I may ask?
 jacek: true ai
 darkhorse64: MCTS with solver and full random playouts
 Scarfield: bitboards?
 darkhorse64: ofc
 Scarfield: yea&#160;:)
 jacek: solver is quite ass with those passes
 trictrac: Othello is with a finish "horizon" it can be very good to use MCTS
 Scarfield: have you considered symmetry yet darkhorse?
 struct: He probably has templates from other multies
 struct: So I guess the answer should be yesa
 Astrobytes: Oh trictrac, slightly off-topic, but what do you think of these potential game suggestions from Maxime? "What do you think about these games? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bkgm.com/variants/NoChanceBG/index.html">https://bkgm.com/variants/NoChanceBG/index.html</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bkgm.com/variants/DominoBackgammon.html">https://bkgm.com/variants/DominoBackgammon.html</a> do you think it could be good games?"
 Astrobytes: (and anyone else who's interested ofc)
 jacek: youre asking trictrac if backgammon is good game&#160;:?
 Astrobytes: lol
 darkhorse64: Pass made me sweat. I reset the tree when I skip move. No symmetry. trictrac: you think MCTS can be a good choice&#160;?
 Astrobytes: MCTS has only (fairly) recently been applied to Othello (compared to alphabeta-style algos), so might take a little bit of work
 trictrac: darkhorse64&#160;: yes I am using alpha-beta and I am sure than MCTS will defeat my bot
 trictrac: Astrobytes&#160;: I will have a look on your game proposal
 Astrobytes: trictrac: not mine, was CG Maxime on the discord channel
 darkhorse64: Says the man ith a 15 points lead against me.
 darkhorse64: *with*
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: Just checked the leaderboard, that's pretty impressive
 struct: I hope Msmits join soon
 jacek: as soon as he finishes book
 Scarfield: the smithy adviced to make a no-move node for passes, seemed a very good idea
 darkhorse64: Anyway, I am not desperate. I see lots of areas for improvement. Faster engine, using an eval
 eulerscheZahl: so Astrobytes was right about who will be the first to beat the fox
 struct: trictrac I always see you with Le Renard and Eric SMSO when a multi releases, do you guys do a small competition?
 Astrobytes: Yes, eulerscheZahl. I was right even last night&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: struct Thales vs Thales inter-competition&#160;:)
 trictrac: I think we have the same kind of story with programming and we are all 50th
 darkhorse64: Yes, I have a no move node, it makes things simpler but I have not yet found a way to deal when I skip moves. My opponent may play several moves in a row and it's difficult for me to know their order. SO I reset my tree. Anyway, when you start skipping moves, you are almost always in bad shape
 EricSMSO: darkhorse64: It is the first time I program Othello. Simple min/max with my evaluation function. Sure you will do sometjing better
 jacek: i need sleep. i read ejaculation function
 Scarfield: oh havent considered that would be a problem yet, was just thinking of passes comming in one at a time, nice one
 Astrobytes: Oh dear jacek
 EricSMSO: jacek&#160;?
 darkhorse64: My last bots with eval + MCTS were a lot stronger than vanilla MCTS by a huge margin
 darkhorse64: For these kind of things, I prefer to do it myself
 darkhorse64: @jacek
 Scarfield: evaluations?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: see, and youre way behind the top
 darkhorse64: I should ask daaskare to join to increase the Thales group size
 Astrobytes: Thales vs The World
 jacek: whos thals
 NaelDEV: Hello
 trictrac: Astrobytes&#160;: backgamon with no dice, It 's very interresting
 darkhorse64: Regarding new games, a backgammon bot would be interesting: dice + strategy
 Astrobytes: trictrac: Yes, I'd not come across these versions before
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 see my links I posted to tric
 Astrobytes: It's suggestions from Maxime (CG) on the discord, dice-less BG, 2 variants
 darkhorse64: Seen 'em. I was just pointing out the element of randomness within the game makes it interesting for a bot to deal ith
 Astrobytes: Hm. Can go either way I suppose
 struct: I don't like rng, that's why I never ported a game with it
 struct: I was gonna port this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/117/ta-yu">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/117/ta-yu</a>
 darkhorse64: my keyboard is aging. damn 'w' key 
 Astrobytes: struct what was the river flow tile game?
 struct: But had rng
 Astrobytes: yeah that
 EricSMSO: @stuct&#160;: about tt, lR and me: we seem to like the kind of games
 Astrobytes: Then again though struct, the rng factor might make these games a little more interesting to other players, and add interest for current board game enthusiasts as there's a bunch of approaches for dealing with rng in board games
 struct: I'm glad you enjoy them, even if the games can be a bit "similar" to other games
 struct: I think of it like fog games, but I think the rng on ta yu is not that bad
 EricSMSO: Except it's not yellow, or pink panther as we asked
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: Or leopard-print, damn you struct :D
 Astrobytes: I do think ta-yu would be interesting in whatever form
 struct: I don't know what to answer on forum post on othello
 struct: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol, I think he's kidding knowing TBali&#160;:)
 struct: I hope so 
 Scarfield: lol could hardly be anything but a joke&#160;:)
 Scarfield: "(by some eval score)" :D
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes he uses the forum like we use the chat: casual talk
 NaelDEV: :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: and obviously a sorting of actions would make all random bots stronger :P
 Astrobytes: Yep. You'll catch him more often on discord, you kinda get a feel for his humour :P
 jacek: just make corners if you can and youll be higher
 Scarfield: flashback of your 3 corners aginst the fox :p
 jacek: hm?
 Scarfield: el structo linked a screenshot of a game between you and the fox, you had 3 pieces in the end, all in a corner&#160;:)
 jacek: delete dis
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: i think you were online, so assumed you saw it 
 jacek: today not so much
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/ZpDtEVQ">https://imgur.com/ZpDtEVQ</a> cough
 Scarfield: then i made this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sy5cdp">https://prnt.sc/sy5cdp</a>

 AdamB: thx
 AntiSquid: dropped in othello, my D isn't powerful enough
 darkhorse64: D &lt;&lt; 1&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Strengthen your D
 darkhorse64: shift your D
 ganond0rf: are there hidden test cases in clash of code?
 LelouchVC2: Yes
 LelouchVC2: Every test you see has a validator
 LelouchVC2: to make sure u didnt hard code the outputs
 ganond0rf: ah i see
 ganond0rf: was just wondering cuz i got 100% of public test cases and only 75% of private
 ganond0rf: and didnt hard code
 ganond0rf: .-.
 Astrobytes: Probably just missed an edge case/stress testing case
 Astrobytes: Do more puzzles, you'll get a feel for the kind of things you should be on the lookout for
 LelouchVC2: Happens all the time
 LelouchVC2: It's stupid sometimes because you can't actually know what you missed
 LelouchVC2: Especially in reverse when you might not know what an edge case would specificaally me
 LelouchVC2: be*
 Astrobytes: I prefer puzzles over clashes personally
 Astrobytes: Not saying clashes are bad, just not my thing
 LelouchVC2: The puzzles can be so boring
 LelouchVC2: Feels like im just doing college assignments
 Astrobytes: Don't do the ones that bore you then&#160;;)
 LelouchVC2: I don't&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: And there's much more satisfaction in the bot programming or optim sections 
 Snef: LelouchVC2 what about multis&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: multis?
 LelouchVC2: and i entered that pacman thing, but it broken..
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 Snef: it was a challenge but there is plenty of others
 LelouchVC2: I had a copy of my bot that i kept in case i did something terrible, but even that didnt work
 LelouchVC2: Im telling u that thing was giving me the IDs of dead pacs
 Astrobytes: There's Bot Programming, Code Golf and Optimization, you'll never be bored again
 Snef: Yea but you just had to ignore them if you didn't want to use that info 
 LelouchVC2: I couldnt
 LelouchVC2: You only know when ur bot is dead through the ID or whatever in the league after the one i was in
 LelouchVC2: My code was working fine for about a day. Then suddenly it gave me the IDs of dead pacs, and I'd lose half the games by giving orders to dead pacs
 LelouchVC2: pissed me off
 LelouchVC2: Bot programming was fun since it was a big competition, but it's not really my thing&#160;:(
 LelouchVC2: I'll check out code golf I guess
 Astrobytes: Sure, not every category suits everyone&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: And not all black lives matter
 LelouchVC2: Finally, someone who gets it
 LelouchVC2: "Binary is good! But unary is much better!"
 LelouchVC2: Said no one ever
 Uljahn: 50 shades of unary, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: u will be able to reach legend in csb
 LelouchVC2: If you use 0s and spaces in unary
 LelouchVC2: Then it's basically binary

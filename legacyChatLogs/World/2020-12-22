 datdood: why are there bots on this site?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why? explain us
 Automaton2000: if i did it before
 MadKnight: they were before there were bots datdood so it's ok
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 says that
 Automaton2000: i had a lot of languages
 Emmaplayz: bla bla bla
 datdood:&#160;?
 datdood: that made no sense
 datdood: why are there bots?
 typingm: Hey all. Coming back after being away for a while. In CoC, if I play with JavaScript and use the "print" function, the syntax highlighting crosses out the word "print," which I haven't seen before. Any idea what might be going on there? I thought print was added as a convenience for CoC code golfing so JavaScripters don't have to write out console.log?
 typingm: I should add, print still works, it's just crossed out.
 VizGhar: typingm you see something like this? If you don't get response here in chat, try to report it using forum. It's pretty active there too <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/disabling-pycodestyle/188260">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/disabling-pycodestyle/188260</a>
 typingm: Interesting, thanks. I'll take a look.
 StrideNYC: This AI bot thing is so dope!
 StrideNYC: I'm on the first one. Just unlocked boost :o
 Uljahn: ye, very addictive&#160;:)
 slvt_c0d3r: LF&gt; coding gf
 StrideNYC: what lol
 slvt_c0d3r: dont worry about it kid
 S3w3r_R4t: wut? i heard my name :3
 StrideNYC: You got it, old man&#160;;)
 jacek: good morning
 Mirou26: HELLO
 AntiSquid: morning
 VizGhar: Is there any bot game with more then 4 players? I'm really considering it as possibility right now
 eulerscheZahl: 4 is the max for existing games. CG allows up to 8
 VizGhar: Original of my game states 2-8 players, and I can fit them all on screen. I'll try it
 eulerscheZahl: you risk some randomness in ranking that way. personally I prefer 2 player games
 eulerscheZahl: but sure, go ahead
 VizGhar: Can't break it while WIP&#160;:)
 AI_says_hi: Hey guys I have a question: I want to try to use the genetic algorithm in Ghost in the Cell. To train it, should I create an abstract clone of the game locally and train there or is there an other way to do that?
 struct: AI_says_hi have you checked post mortems?
 AI_says_hi: struct yes the GitC one but he didn't use GA
 AI_says_hi: struct are there some that describe it? 
 struct: some players used
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ghost-in-the-cell-feedback-strategy/2634/5">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ghost-in-the-cell-feedback-strategy/2634/5</a>
 AI_says_hi: okay imma go read thanks
 AI_says_hi: :slight_smile::thumbsup:
 lopidav: &gt;You reached the limit of plays for a period of time
 lopidav: what is this
 jacek: addict detector
 lopidav: but I was there for like 10 minutes
 VizGhar: :D jacek you are my superhero
 BOBKA: An error occurred (#314): "Submitted code is too big".WTF? What is the limit?
 jacek: lopidav and how many times you submitted
 jacek: BOBKA 100k characters
 lopidav: submitted once. Trying to test maybe once every 10s at my fastest
 lopidav: it's working now
 jacek: :thumbsup:
 struct: :pensive:
 struct: Finally found the bug :cry:
 jacek: you fixed it and its worse?
 struct: No, just fixed it
 struct: dont know how
 struct: Thats a problem
 mzbear: maybe you didn't fix it.  maybe you just rearranged things so that it doesn't bite you right now&#160;;)
 struct:  Im pretty sure its fixed
 struct: before it wouldnt work 2/10 times
 struct: now its working 10/10 times, I know its a low sample
 struct: but seems to be fine
 mzbear: VizGhar: tsuro with 8 players would mean 4 moves per player until the board is full.  that's a bit low
 mzbear: hmm.  actually, it might not be too low.  i dont know.  i'd have to think about the game a bit more
 starmaq: hmm why are all the test cases in 208
 starmaq: wait
 starmaq: nvm
 Avenslova: Hey guys
 struct: hello
 mzbear: i have a feeling that in the 8 player tsuro the nature of the game turns into trying to guess which player is holding which piece
 mzbear: i have no idea how to make a bot for that
 struct: I guess it was worth Reused up to depth: 4 states: 39039 time: 1
 darkhorse64: It all depends if we know what each player has in hands, With many players, it will be hard to find a move that allows to survive until next turn
 eulerscheZahl: JBM: "I personally don’t look at the WIP anymore, precisely because they’re too much of everything anyway"also JBM: keeps troll vs castle as WIP for over a decade
 jacek: he hasnt decided of final mechanics of the game yet
 jacek: maybe 3 players version would be better
 eulerscheZahl: he's hoping for more valuable feedback from the community
 Noobness:  can I have a question? how popular are the "bot programming" games with significant random factor (e.g. card games)?
 eulerscheZahl: unpopular
 Noobness: thought so, thanks
 jacek: huh?
 jacek: just there arent many
 eulerscheZahl: locam got some hate for the draft and random order in which you get to play the cards
 eulerscheZahl: random map generation, then full info of the game state (or fog in a reasonable way)that's the popular kind of game here
 jacek: yeah, no one likes random games like onitama
 eulerscheZahl: it's a perfect information game
 eulerscheZahl: no hidden cards that you can reveal during the game
 struct: missing fog
 jacek: r
 Noobness: got it, thanks.. I was thinking about creating really cool card game, but.. it's a card game, so I'll think some more&#160;:)
 lopidav: I was thinking about putting my tabletop game ideas here so I can balance out degenerate strategies. Will I still be able to sell the game if I do that or the license would forbid that?
 struct: sell the game where=
 struct: You want to use CG to balance game / strategies?
 eulerscheZahl: by uploading you agree to CC2 license
 lopidav: struct, yea, create it as a puzzle/game and let people make solutions/bots.
 eulerscheZahl: we should warn you that community games get relatively little attention
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. vindinium: 227 players since february 2019
 eulerscheZahl: is one of the more popular games
 lopidav: that's a lot. I think 10 somewhat active programmers is a good amount to playtest like that
 lopidav: cc2 let's you share/sell etc without permission as long as there is a credit given?
 Astrobytes: also, be forewarned: it's a tough crowd&#160;;)
 lopidav: *without asking for a permission
 eulerscheZahl: you as a creator can sell it after publishing here
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if we could do so while giving credit
 eulerscheZahl: we can share for sure
 lopidav: Astrobytes in which way?
 eulerscheZahl: we find bugs and then complain about them. even if very minor
 lopidav: &gt;Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the materialfor any purpose, even commercially.
 jacek: who reads license :o
 Astrobytes: Legal teams jacek
 struct: I didnt even know there was a license until now
 eulerscheZahl: i know that i'm fine when I want to use an MIT licensed code
 lopidav: CoC puzzles are kinda sold, aren't they?
 struct: someday Yavalath creator comes knock at my door
 jacek: how will he know its you
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: that's why you deleted your account struct?
 Astrobytes: I think he'd probably be OK with it considering what it's used for
 struct: exactly
 Astrobytes: And you're not selling it
 struct: He is ok, he knows about it
 struct: aCat knows him and talked with him about it
 eulerscheZahl: even got a private message from one user saying that he'll buy the board game now
 eulerscheZahl: onitama
 Astrobytes: Oh really? Nice
 struct: yes
 struct: But I published the game before knowing this
 Astrobytes: haha, free advertising eh euler
 Astrobytes: That's just your inner pirate struct
 eulerscheZahl: and ornicar knows about Vindinium
 jacek: a certain game 'board' is really cheap - just some :notebook: and :pencil:
 Astrobytes: Don't be so arrrrd on yourself :P
 struct: Im sure most of the people will be happy their board game is being freely advertised
 eulerscheZahl: he's the one behind lichess btw
 Astrobytes: yeah that's right. You asked permission first right?
 eulerscheZahl: no, MIT license
 Astrobytes: ah OK
 eulerscheZahl: but unihedron shared a screenshot of a discord message (other server) where he was told about the CG port
 Astrobytes: struct: and used for bot programming too
 Astrobytes: euler: and he was cool with it I assume
 eulerscheZahl: totally
 Astrobytes: struct: did you fix The Bug yet?
 struct: yes
 struct: I added - 1 and it works now
 Astrobytes: -1 to what?
 struct: int nextFirstId = pool[firstId].firstChildIndex;// This lastId - 1 fixed it??????????int nextLastId = pool[lastId - 1].lastChildIndex;
 eulerscheZahl: nextLastIdthat name
 Astrobytes: so my off by one was kinda right in a way
 utlumurat: hello all could you advice me any source about beam search
 Astrobytes: wait for firstNextLastId
 struct: euler the name is not the worse about my code
 struct: you should see the function I shared here the other day
 struct: void Agent::think(Table* lookup, const int8(&amp;pieces)[8][2], int8(&amp;check)[HEIGHT * WIDTH][2], int8&amp; checkCounter, int8(&amp;cells)[32][2], int8(&amp;visited)[WIDTH][HEIGHT]);
 struct: was it this one?
 Astrobytes: utlumurat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/11358/breadth-first-search-and-beam-search-comparison">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/11358/breadth-first-search-and-beam-search-comparison</a>
 Astrobytes: yes that's the one struct
 utlumurat: thank you Astrobytes
 struct: That is one of many astro

 Astrobytes: lol. As long as you can read it 
 eulerscheZahl: note: don't ask struct for help regarding clean code
 eulerscheZahl: that used to be ThunderbirdOne's task&#160;:(
 Emmaplayz: bla bla bla
 Astrobytes: ThunderbirdOne still pops in here now and then euler
 eulerscheZahl: maybe during my office hours?
 Astrobytes: yeah, come to think of it I think so
 Astrobytes: He's just busy with work and life iirc
 eulerscheZahl: and smits comes when i'm asleep
 eulerscheZahl: so smits = tooth fairy
 Astrobytes: that reasoning
 Astrobytes: does he leave bitboards under your pillow?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: hey, i am lurking
 MSmits: i expect a tooth tonight
 MSmits: better pick a fight with your neighbor
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: he keeps ordering packages and isn't at home when they arrive
 Astrobytes: Definitely worthy of violent confrontation.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: he's probably violating covid rules as well
 Astrobytes: Spray paint "covidiot" on his door and break his windows. He should give you a good right hook for that at least.
 Astrobytes: Disclaimer: Don't.
 MSmits: lol
 LastRick: That's no way to dislodge a tooth. Didn't none of y'all watch Santa Clause 2?
 Astrobytes: The Tim Allen one?
 LastRick: yes
 Astrobytes: Hm, I only recall seeing the first one.
 LastRick: the middle, oft overlooked one has a lot of Tooth Fairy in it for some reason
 Astrobytes: we already established that MSmits is the tooth fairy
 darkhorse64: MSmits: I could not get the bias thing for win/teccles/freemoves in my select to work, so I made it really dirty: bypass search for "teccles" strategy and play it straight. I moved from the 19th to 12th  (1.5 ELO more). Not too bad for 10 lines
 Astrobytes: I thought that was what people were doing with the teccles heuristic anyway
 advq: Hello, Can I get this week puzzle link; thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048</a>
 advq: thanks man; I deleted from notifications haha
 darkhorse64: I was thinking that biasing search would be enough. Actually, it just like I have an opening book not very deep
 eulerscheZahl: while submitting the default code is enough for the quest, you are supposed to optimize your score at that puzzle
 darkhorse64: Don't. I want to score more points with my one liner
 Astrobytes: there probably is a way to do it via biasing but whether it would be better, I'm not sure
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: I pm'd you a nice combination previously
 darkhorse64: It's in production (as in farming)
 darkhorse64: Actually, it's a kind of optimisation: which arrangement of the four letters will score the most
 darkhorse64: I guess euler is bad reading me
 darkhorse64: *mad*
 eulerscheZahl: not at all
 darkhorse64: Of course, scoring &lt; 0.1% of the best mark is not really an achievement
 darkhorse64: Already +50 people for the puzzle; dbdr is harvesting
 Skynse: println!("Hello everyone");
 darkhorse64: Only python code is accepted
 darkhorse64: :relaxed:
 eulerscheZahl: but the highest ranked among the new players is at #39
 Westicles: You should try it, pretty fun
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327912401_Comparison_of_Expectimax_and_Monte_Carlo_algorithms_in_Solving_the_online_2048_game/link/5bacdd4092851ca9ed2a29ce/download">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327912401_Comparison_of_Expectimax_and_Monte_Carlo_algorithms_in_Solving_the_online_2048_game/link/5bacdd4092851ca9ed2a29ce/download</a>
 darkhorse64: I have seen also n-tuple based solutions
 eulerscheZahl: while the number of default code submissions increased from 8 to 34
 eulerscheZahl: *35lastrick i see what you are doing
 LastRick: Probably silly Q about 2048: What's the significance of the test names?
 eulerscheZahl: random seed used
 eulerscheZahl: (starting from empty board)
 eulerscheZahl: so what you get as an input is after 2 random numbers were generated
 LastRick: ok. I have to confess, I know nothing about this game. So for me, it was a perfectly reasonable Q
 Emmaplayz: bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bala bal
 eulerscheZahl: even if you played the game day and night, you wouldn't know those numbers
 eulerscheZahl: fair warning Emmaplayz
 LastRick: oh ok
 Emmaplayz: what
 eulerscheZahl: stop writing "bla bla bla", was your 2nd time already
 Astrobytes: stop bla bla'ing or you'll be kicked
 Emmaplayz: why 
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that
 Emmaplayz: your just mean
 eulerscheZahl: my just mean what?
 Astrobytes: No, you're just spamming.
 Emmaplayz: i did it beacuse im bored
 eulerscheZahl: then the chat isn't the right place for you
 Emmaplayz: what
 Emmaplayz: how old are
 Emmaplayz: you
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: I'm not nagging you to come and moderate it, note ;p
 FatPuppy: The website says you can challenge a friend.. I can't see where or does it not support a private 2 player challenge?
 Emmaplayz: how old are youeulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: the troll game?i want to look into your freecell contribution
 struct: clash of code supports it
 eulerscheZahl: that's irrelevant Emmaplayz
 Emmaplayz: how do you ban
 LastRick: what makes a game of 2048 end? in other words, if I just input "U", shouldn't it end when the board is filled?
 eulerscheZahl: 600 turns
 eulerscheZahl: CG limitations
 eulerscheZahl: you can print multiple actions like ULR
 eulerscheZahl: which is why the map generator is public so you know how spawns work
 LastRick: it says U is invalid, is that because the pieces are already at the top?
 Westicles: Hint:  You can get 50M without using D (insert D joke as you see fit)
 eulerscheZahl: yes LastRick. try another direction&#160;;)
 LastRick: thanks. is that in the instructions? I didn't see it. I just assume it would keep filling
 eulerscheZahl: you have to make a valid push first
 eulerscheZahl: might be that i missed mentioning it
 eulerscheZahl: and so far no one complained as the game is well known
 Westicles: yeah, just play it a few times, easier than thinking
 LastRick: never assume the user has played it, especially me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play2048.co/">https://play2048.co/</a>fix it
 LastRick:&#160;:)
 LastRick: url blocked
 eulerscheZahl: where are you? at work?
 LastRick: work, home it's all the same these days&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: true
 Westicles: People don't play games any more, they just watch streams of it
 LastRick: ^ so true
 LastRick: people just sitting around for hours watching others play Smash, Runescape, chess. I would've never predicted Twitch. Never.
 Westicles: There is another pastime popular when I was a teen going the same way
 Astrobytes: not just sitting around: donating money
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i haven't even heard of many of the now popular games
 LastRick: Astro: millions. To have other watch you pay Overwatch
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It's incredible.
 LastRick: How am I supposed to convince some kid to study Thermo and get "a good paying" engineer job when there's this out there as another option?
 Astrobytes: Right. Or becoming an "influencer"...
 Astrobytes: Don't get me started.
 LastRick: yep, that's all they think about now.
 twitlydoof: you convince them through probability 
 LastRick: That moment when the chat turned into a bunch of old men, complaining about whippersnappers
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 Astrobytes: Valid points regardless.
 Westicles: They'll come out with a decent nootropic in the next few years and it will fix them all
 CheerJia: Hello
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I can see that coming Westicles
 Uljahn: what is survivorship bias, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or when you are done
 jacek: AutomatonNN how old are mods
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Emmaplayz: nerds
 Emmaplayz: :nerd:
 Astrobytes: Yes?
 eulerscheZahl: sorry I lost patience
 Astrobytes: I almost did it earlier without a warning if I'm completely honest.
 Astrobytes: And I have the patience of a saint.
 LastRick: Ok, Euler, I think I'm getting the hang of it. I improved my bot 100x by inputting something other than U every time
 eulerscheZahl: great
 Astrobytes: now get 1st&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: random replay of my bot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517604960">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517604960</a>
 eulerscheZahl: keep in mind others are much better than me
 LastRick: Are you hiding some moves in the replay?
 eulerscheZahl: no. combining several in a single frame
 LastRick: thats what i meant. it seems like it jumps ahead
 eulerscheZahl: if i generate a new frame for each move, the replay gets extremely laggy and will most likely crash your tab&#160;:(
 LastRick: ok
 eulerscheZahl: watch it and don't jump between frames via arrow keys
 eulerscheZahl: top players get a replay duration of several hours
 LastRick: ah i see what you mean. its only when you use the arrow keys that it jumps
 LastRick: it seems like the general idea is the maximize the open space on the board by either combining or moving pieces to the edge
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, keep the largest in the corner
 eulerscheZahl: and then form some kind of snake
 LastRick: yep
 LastRick: like some weird extension of tron
 LastRick: later gtg for a run. finally warmed up enough i wont instantly freeze
 eulerscheZahl: how warm/cold is it?
 eulerscheZahl: in Celsius please
 LastRick: hah
 LastRick: 9. sorry had to do the math&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: not that cold at all
 Dartisan: Hi, had you got the news: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://phys.org/news/2020-12-artificial-intelligence-schrdinger-equation.html">https://phys.org/news/2020-12-artificial-intelligence-schrdinger-equation.html</a>
 Dartisan: Thought on CodinGame when reading: Quantum Monte Carlo
 Astrobytes: wave function &lt;shudder&gt;
 Astrobytes: PTSD from materials chemistry
 Astrobytes: Cool research though
 Uljahn: ye, that's cool when NN gives you right results most of the time, but when it's wrong you're screwed not being able to debug or explain such a behavior
 Dartisan: Yes, I like to see in which speed these domains growth currently.
 RyanGilbert: Are few people online currently?
 RyanGilbert: Just wondering if I should stream or not
 Emmaplayz: hi
 Emmaplayz: yes 
 Emmaplayz: i can talk
 Emmaplayz: :rolling_eyes:

 bugsr2bad: hello
 Jyriane: :upside_down:
 Czihi: What is this clash of code question XDDD
 Czihi: Draw polynomial in 9x9 matrix xD
 Czihi: That's kinda sick lol
 Czihi: Everyone just insta submitted to be faster in getting 0% LOL
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/588831b7842fe8bd570c1c303c6c2b691c89">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/588831b7842fe8bd570c1c303c6c2b691c89</a>this one?
 Czihi: Exactly this one xD
 Czihi: I mean, its interesting
 Czihi: But judging by usual clash of code questions
 Czihi: That are mainly like do something on array
 Czihi: Its kinda sick heh
 eulerscheZahl: i agree, doesn't look appropriate for a clash
 Jyriane: :joy:
 i-dont-know: aa
 eulerscheZahl: 7 hours from the first to last comment for that contribution
 eulerscheZahl: seems that approval was a bit rushed
 Astrobytes: looks like it
 PeterD26codinmaster: :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: and the equation is valid python syntax
 eulerscheZahl: heavily favoring that language over others
 Astrobytes: lol, so it is
 eulerscheZahl: if you give a bad rating to those clashes, they'll get removed even after approval
 RustyPony_f572: pikachu xd
 Astrobytes: classroom time again is it?
 Jyriane: :relieved:
 jacek: pony eh
 Piokemon: where i can join to clash?
 draconis19: go to the #clash channel
 LastRick: Euler how could tell that was seven hours on the submission, (I believe you) but I dont see that in the timestamps
 Emmaplayz: how do you code?
 draconis19: typing
 draconis19: :blush:
 Emmaplayz: haha
 draconis19: laugh now, cuz im just getting started on this site.
 draconis19: :smiling_imp:
 ZarthaxX: xd
 Emmaplayz: you mean XD\
 Emmaplayz: youse caps
 eulerscheZahl: LastRick exact time shows on mouseover
 Astrobytes: yeah ZarthaxX, ECKS-DEE
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 LastRick: half an hour between all 3 approvals
 Westicles: shameful, all just for some XP
 Piokemon: how to get up in ranking?
 Piokemon: clash of code?
 TsakBoolhak: i guess completing clashs ^^
 eulerscheZahl: not just completing. winning!
 TsakBoolhak: the best place you have the best it is, i guess
 TsakBoolhak: better it is*
 TsakBoolhak: how, so let's say you're 2/8 your rank doesnt go up?
 LastRick: yes, winning doesnt necessarily mean you'll go up
 LastRick: this is my favorite social media. can i get this chat on an app?&#160;:)
 draconis19: yes you can,
 Astrobytes: mmm I think Jabber works, not sure what else
 draconis19: just download discord
 LastRick: Of course you can. I was half kidding bc of the goofy stuff that seems to happen on here
 VizGhar: &gt; The CodinGame chat uses XMPP, which means you can use an external XMPP client, such as Pidgin or Gajim.
 Astrobytes: ah gotcha
 NoiselessBrocolli_c9f0: super
 NoiselessBrocolli_c9f0: :grinning:
 ian173: How do I convince clash im not a robot
 Astrobytes: Clash less
 ian173: These captchas getting annoying
 LastRick: I convince it by losing more
 VizGhar: Aren't you one of those, that immediately leaves clash, just to get to Achievement?&#160;:)
 VizGhar: += ASAP
 LastRick: i'm the guy that looks at the clash and sees a novel and I'm like i aint got all day to be reading stuff
 Westicles: That's what I did.  Clicked through 50 to get mod rights
 NoiselessBrocolli_c9f0: :100:
 draconis19: what other channels are there?
 Westicles: #thenaughtylady
 Astrobytes: this web chat isn't linked to the discord
 Astrobytes: lol
 draconis19: oh
 sudo-u[Artemis]:&#160;:)
 sudo-u[Artemis]: it was fun 
 draconis19: u can finally chat when ur lvl 3
 draconis19: right Astrobytes?
 LastRick: sounds right
 Astrobytes: yep
 jacek: right AutomatonNN?
 jacek: AutomatonNN where are you
 AutomatonNN: more than that
 Astrobytes: But you can join the discord just by clicking the link at the top
 LastRick: Uh oh
 LastRick: had me worried for a sec
 jacek: or by pissing of the celestia
 draconis19: i have an discord
 MACKEYTH: Oh, wow. CoC is a whole different beast with Python
 draconis19: I joined the discord I'm draconis190
 VizGhar: try ruby&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: nice one draconis19
 draconis19: really im on your discord server
 draconis19: and nice pic on discord Astrobytes

 eulerscheZahl: CodinGame
 draconis19: so u have a clan?
 Astrobytes: no, the [CG] indicates staff members
 draconis19: oh
 draconis19: in that case, ima start a private clash
 draconis19: and if you want to join my clash, go to the #clash channel!

 Velcoro: (I'm sorry that it sounds like a humble brag question) I have 71/72 silver achievements and couldn't figure out which is the one missing.. or is it bugged?
 struct: I think its from a removed puzzle
 mzbear: if the achievement list doesn't have remarks on any of the entries, i'd say it's a bug regardless of whether the last achievement can be obtained or not
 Velcoro: ah I see, thank you
 MSmits: damn
 MSmits: my D&amp;B is going well
 MSmits: I just finished a heuristic bot, just handle the endgame with some sensible heuristics. Easy top 10
 RoboStac: velcoro - check the mars lander ep 1 achievement
 RoboStac: theres a silver level to it you don't have

 Velcoro: oh, I see, cool, thanks!

 MSmits: romeo and julia?
 MSmits: The shakespear language&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 AIDRI: ahah
 AIDRI: no, this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://julialang.org/">https://julialang.org/</a>
 AIDRI: that's a very good langage
 MSmits: I was serious though
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language</a>
 AIDRI: xD
 mzbear: if the site starts adding esoteric languages, i want to see INTERCAL
 MSmits: hey mzbear. I made 4th D&amp;B
 MSmits: no search, no end game solver
 Astrobytes: lol gj
 MSmits: yeah, i remember when dbdr was nr 1 and they discussed all that minimax stuff
 MSmits: his bot is now 9
 MSmits: so minimax is not the way to go here, at least not the way it was done before
 mzbear: MSmits, i didn't finish my heuristics or I'd be a bit higher myself. My bot currently always takes a square if it can, even if that leads to enemy getting an entire chain in return
 Astrobytes: you used your research in your heuristic bot though?
 struct: I only know chains from STC
 MSmits: i used only the basic heuristics you will find in any paper about D&amp;B, nothing advanced. I have a few more I could add, but I am not going to bother. The solver should take care o fit
 MSmits: its a bit difficult to fit in
 MSmits: my solver only calculates the value of the board, it has to actually produce a move
 mzbear: i'm currently looking at Bandas, i love the simplicity of the rules in this one
 MSmits: yeah bandas is cool
 MSmits: plain mcts works best
 Astrobytes: speaking of dbd r, didn't see him around for a bit
 MSmits: i saw him less than a week ago
 MSmits: talking about some optim
 MSmits: forgot which
 MSmits: btw: My D&amp;B bot does random moves till end game 
 MSmits: just to add to insult
 MSmits: it just avoids giving away boxes
 MSmits: and takes boxes that are given away
 MSmits: so random about half the game
 Astrobytes: ah cool.lol, random then greedy
 MSmits: yeah exactly
 Astrobytes: love it
 Astrobytes: did you check out reCurs e chess yet?
 MSmits: oh, is it live&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: it's in WIP now yeah
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: well queens gambit got me back into chess, so this has become a bit more interesting to me as well, otherwise i would have probably ignored it like the go game
 Astrobytes: I've not written anything for it yet but it's rather good
 MSmits: i'll check it out
 MSmits: hope its not too easy to just copy stockfish into it
 MSmits: at least the generalized parts
 Astrobytes: I doubt that
 jacek: queen's gambit eh? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/r5nif5jgje361.jpg">https://i.redd.it/r5nif5jgje361.jpg</a>
 MSmits: good
 Astrobytes: Queen's Gambit? You've been studying chess openings?
 MSmits: awesome jacek&#160;:)
 MSmits: no the series, but yeah openings too
 DomiKo: jacek how you always have a meme for anything?
 Astrobytes: I've never heard of the series
 MSmits: i did some games on chess.com. over 1200 rating now after not playing for 30 yrs
 jacek: its simple - i have no life
 MSmits: you should really watch it
 DomiKo: ohhh
 darkhorse64: It's really a high quality contrib but I believe Chess960 should be a multi on its own. Once you have reached league 2, you are playing the crazy house variant. There is no turning back
 jacek: oh there are 2 different leagues
 Astrobytes: It's to avoid booking darkhorse64
 jacek: yeah, its like go 9x9 13x13 19x19
 struct: one is 960
 struct: other is crazy house 960
 darkhorse64: There is no booking at Chess960
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, I thought you meant normal chess + 960
 piedro: test
 Metanoob: hey! just dropping a line for people who like chess. I recommend 5D chess it's on steam but you can prob find it cheaper somewhere else. It's chess with time travel basically
 Astrobytes: gotcha now darkhorse64
 piedro: Hello I have a question, how do you pass from wood to other leagues&#160;?
 piedro: from wood to bronze 
 piedro:&#160;?
 Metanoob: @piedro once you beat the boss of your league in the ranking you are getting to the next league
 Astrobytes: He's considering separate contributions for each darkhorse64
 jacek: you need to be above boss after you submit
 Metanoob: yeah not beating, my bad, beating it's ranking
 Metanoob: its*
 MSmits: can someone link the contribution?
 Astrobytes: oh hey Metanoob
 piedro: @Metanoob I am ranked 1/46112 somehow now but still in the Wood one 
 MSmits: the page is lagging fo rme
 Astrobytes: Chess:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/865494807d115f7493e0b7fa465bc5d2780647">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/865494807d115f7493e0b7fa465bc5d2780647</a>
 MSmits: probably my meta mcts hogging cpu :P
 jacek: crazyhouse960 aka antimsmits chess
 Metanoob: hey Astrobytes! how are you?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: alll good, and you?
 Astrobytes: wrong link, sorry:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/596072cf63b511115793f16db1169835cdc9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/596072cf63b511115793f16db1169835cdc9</a>
 MSmits: 960 means the bottom row?
 Metanoob: same thank you&#160;:) on holidays atm so more time to kill
 MSmits: i suspect bishops still have separate colors
 MSmits: oh right, it says in description
 Metanoob: oh piedro, I think it may take some time depending on when you got that rank... If it has been more than a few hours I don't think I know what would cause that
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: yeah, more time to code&#160;:)
 struct: also the king must start between two towers
 struct: iirc
 struct: rook*
 MSmits: doesnt this actually make it 480 possibilities&gt;
 MSmits: symmetry&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 struct: its 959 + standard
 reCurse: Well at least you're not a math teacher :D
 MSmits: I mean left-right
 MSmits: or is that already incorporated
 Metanoob: haha yes @Astrobytes 
 reCurse: How would the symmetry work with one queen?
 MSmits: what i mean is
 MSmits: you can mirror x the board
 MSmits: and you get the same setup
 MSmits: except mirrored = uses the same opening book movs
 MSmits: so i would need to create a book for 480 starts
 jacek: "Randomizing the main pieces had long been known as shuffle chess, but Fischer random chess introduces new rules for the initial random setup, "preserving the dynamic nature of the game by retaining bishops of opposite colours for each player and the right to castle for both sides".[5] The result is 960 unique possible starting positions."
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess</a>
 MSmits: jacek yes, but this does not incorporate horizontal mirror symnmetry I believe
 jacek: x_x
 darkhorse64: MSmits needs UTF32 to store all these books
 darkhorse64: :relaxed:
 MSmits: well consider that I use less thab 1500 moves for Yavalath and i have room for 50-80k
 MSmits: It's still doable, but would take too long
 darkhorse64: 960 meta MCTS
 MSmits: nope 480
 jacek: why 480
 MSmits: maybe I am not being clear enough sorry, let me try again
 MSmits: if i take all pieces on A and place them on H
 MSmits: B on G
 jacek: imagine standard chess, a4 isnt the same as h4
 darkhorse64: Books ready for retirement
 MSmits: C on F
 MSmits: D on E
 MSmits: i mirrored the pieces in the horizontal direction
 MSmits: this is also a 960 setup
 MSmits: a different one
 MSmits: so these two can use the same book
 jacek: are you really gonna book chess960
 MSmits: in standard chess it isnt jacek
 MSmits: but thats because of the king and queen
 MSmits: now you can switch them
 MSmits: if you take standard chess and switch king and queen, the game is exactly the same
 reCurse: I am pretty sure you misunderstand
 MSmits: just all moves are mirrored
 reCurse: The symmetry doesn't work because of castling
 MSmits: hmm how is that
 jacek: ahh in 960 castling always end as standard chess
 MSmits: just to be clear, I am *not* going to book this
 MSmits: not even if i can
 MSmits: too much work
 MSmits: I like the game though, i will give it a try at some point
 MSmits: btw, the different starts do share transpositions
 Astrobytes: check the wiki page I linked MSmits
 Astrobytes: hopefully explains some things
 MSmits: hmm i see, so it has different castling left and right
 MSmits: regardless of queen and kings position
 MSmits: so if you mirror the game, you cant mirror all the moves
 MSmits: 960 then&#160;:)
 MSmits: anyone have a replay from the game?
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/517667268">https://www.codingame.com/replay/517667268</a>
 Astrobytes: the day you don't question something will be a sad day indeed MSmits&#160;;)
 MSmits: share something jacek
 MSmits: err
 MSmits: share replay
 MSmits: true Astrobytes
 MSmits: *not authorized*
 jacek: go to the contribution and last battles
 MSmits: cant, no bot
 jacek: submit something
 MSmits: maybe full leaderboard
 reCurse: Can't share replays for WIP?
 jacek: printing random will make random move
 reCurse: Sucks
 MSmits: wow reCurse, you even made it beginner friendly
 MSmits: it just does moves
 reCurse: It even checkmates once in a blue moon.
 MSmits: very cool, gj 
 jacek: woah, even threefold repetition detection
 MSmits: mmh this will have endgame books though
 reCurse: Good luck fitting those
 jacek: not the second league
 MSmits: small ones&#160;:)
 reCurse: Do small tablebases even exist?
 MSmits: whats different in second league?
 MSmits: I would just generate them myself
 reCurse: Crazyhouse
 reCurse: aka no endgame
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: no endgame books then
 reCurse: Looks like I'll be publishing both so
 Astrobytes: It's AntiSmits Chess
 MSmits: had to look up what crazyhouse was
 jacek: all you have left is only middle books
 MSmits: reCurse dont do them both at once, new multis are popular for a while before people move on. If you leave one for later, you get a second wave
 reCurse: Hmm.
 reCurse: They don't even get notifications, would it matter?
 MSmits: people know on chat. But it's your choice obviously. I've just noticed this is how it goes
 Astrobytes: I think interested parties would do both regardless
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: maybe it doesnt matter, i dont know
 MSmits: might be trivial to adapt
 MSmits: (the bot)
 reCurse: I made it so it should be straightforward to submit on both.
 Astrobytes: and we'll have somewhere to point chess-y people too
 Astrobytes: *to
 MSmits: yeah, there's been a lot of talk about chess on CG
 MSmits: might even draw some new players
 Astrobytes: just the usual lack of exposure issue
 hexando: first place in coder strike. I want kids from myself
 struct: end game table bases are too big
 struct: but maybe you can do something like it
 reCurse: Personally I'd rather leave that space for a NN, if I ever get to it
 jacek: 50 ms?
 MSmits: struct I have 2 million positions in bandas, 50 million or so in oware I think
 MSmits: you can generate them in the 1st second 
 MSmits: not sure how expensive chess endgame books are to generate
 struct: Well you want to generate for all possible states
 reCurse: They are usually downloaded rather than generated
 reCurse: Might give a hint
 MSmits: yes, but it depends very heavily on the number of pieces
 MSmits: a 7 piece db is like 30 times bigger than a 6 piece
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endgame_tablebase#Computer_chess">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endgame_tablebase#Computer_chess</a>
 MSmits: i am just pulling the 30 number out of my ***
 MSmits: but its a big number
 MSmits: so small db might be possible in 1 second
 MSmits: maybe 3 pieces
 struct: I think 3 pieces is the only realistic one
 Astrobytes: smits, if you somehow manage to book this I'll give you 0.5€
 MSmits: yeah, but that still helps
 MSmits: Astrobytes we're talking engame books
 reCurse: That confident incentive
 MSmits: i wont do opening for sure
 MSmits: i have  3 piece checkers one
 MSmits: havent put it into my bot
 MSmits: locally i have a 6 piece checkers one
 Astrobytes: well, best of luck with it
 MSmits: not for a while. I'll submit the random bot though&#160;:)
 MSmits: so cool that you dont even need to code anything
 MSmits: this is gonna have thousands of players
 Astrobytes: btw if 0.5€ is like 1200 GBP or something next year I reserve the right to reduce the amount accordingly :P
 MSmits: lol
 reCurse: Cautious pessimism, I like
 jacek: try 0.5btc
 Astrobytes: No.
 jacek: lets ask CG to install this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>
 MSmits: chess moves confuse me
 MSmits: i mean the notation
 MSmits: sometimes they only use the destination, because only one piece can go there
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_%28chess%29#Disambiguating_moves">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_%28chess%29#Disambiguating_moves</a>
 MSmits: if you need a whole page to explain the notation, it's too complicated :P
 reCurse: Says... the physics teacher.
 MSmits: bah, maxwells equation fit on 2 lines
 MSmits: ok so the standard model lagrangian is a page
 reCurse: Just be glad it's not the descriptive notation
 MSmits: but if the entire workings of the universe takes the same amount of space as your games' notation explanation, something is wrong :P
 Astrobytes: eww maxwells
 Astrobytes: PTSD again
 MSmits: ah you had to do that for chemistry?
 Astrobytes: yeah it was a thing
 MSmits: didnt know chemists learned so much physics
 MSmits: i know they do quantum
 Astrobytes: It's quite important, we don't go as deep as you guys though
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: well, physical chemists do
 Astrobytes: biologists tend not to
 MSmits: well chemistry is basically just an offshoot of phyiscs anyway
 Astrobytes: yep
 Astrobytes: and a cool one at that
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: the physicists of 200 years ago were also chemists
 MSmits: and mathematicians
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: well yeah, there wasn't much of a disciplinary separation at that point (still isn't if we're honest about it)
 MSmits: mmh a lot more now though. In my university, Computer science, math and physics do similar classes in the first year
 MSmits: but after that it splits
 MSmits: physicists still do some pure math classes, but not very many
 MSmits: and i dont think mathematicians do any physics
 MSmits: after the first year that is
 Astrobytes: I had the same crap at highschool, I failed maths due to a bad teacher, yet I was able to do higher physics, chemistry and biology with ease.
 MSmits: thats annoying
 MSmits: i didnt have a high math grade either
 MSmits: its not that i didnt get it
 MSmits: it just wasnt interesting because it wasnt applied
 Astrobytes: Yes, I really enjoyed maths. I had to do some catchup on it afterwards.
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, I totally get that.
 MSmits: later on i was doing pure math writing scripts for a 3D game, linear algebra and such and i liked it then
 MSmits: matrices and all that
 MSmits: there was a point to it
 MSmits: I had to shoot space ships that were moving at a distance of 2 km
 Astrobytes: Yup. When you find a purpose it's so much better. Not sure how it's taught nowadays, perhaps they have relevant examples now
 MSmits: probably it is a lot better now
 MSmits: but math and physics teacher have to deal with a lot of poor attitude in students. 
 MSmits: as in "I cant do it anyway, so why try"
 Astrobytes: Yes, comes with the subject. Happens with any scientific or tech-based subject I find.
 MSmits: they convince themselves they cant, so they dont have to work through the frustration of failing often
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: parents dont help either
 Astrobytes: And they've most likely been told they're crap at x, y or z anyway
 Astrobytes: haha yes, see above
 MSmits: a girl will tell her mother, mother says, yeah i couldnt do it either 
 Astrobytes: So, so true.
 DaMonk: My favorite math mantras is: "Even if you think it will fail, try your idea". 
 MSmits: sometimes failure is funny 
 MSmits: like when it ends saying 2 = 1
 Astrobytes: hehe indeed
 Astrobytes: I remember doing calculus, I was in the hospital waiting room visiting a relative, and scribbling down some practice. Burst out laughing because my end result was essentially what I started with but wrong.
 Astrobytes: It hadn't really clicked at that point
 MSmits: and thats when the other patients were wondering if this was the right waiting room
 Astrobytes: Probably :D
 Astrobytes: but yeah, failure is great when you're learning, as DaMonk mentioned, it's a great tool. It just has a bad rep
 jacek: its like making a bug that makes your bot stronger
 MSmits: that does the opposite
 MSmits: it prevents you from learning because fixing the mistake makes it worse :P
 Astrobytes: Yes. Fixing the bug that made your bot stronger and keeping it stronger is a little more useful.
 MSmits: did you have this happen to you Astrobytes?
 MSmits: I think it's the absolute worst
 MSmits: happened maybe twice to me
 MSmits: you know it's a bug and you want to fix it, but you cant submit
 Astrobytes: Yes. That's literally the story of my Oware bot.
 MSmits: heh, even now my oware bot has some weird unexplainable eval features
 Astrobytes: It's a weird game :shrug:
 MSmits: like some lookup arrays with weird param values. I tried to turn it into a sensible function, but nothing helped
 jacek: mine's eval is quite unexplainable
 MSmits: yes but thats by design&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: heh true
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits</a> jrke going to be annoyed :P
 MSmits: just lucky though, bad statistics
 jacek: meh look at crazy remi
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: gonna need more to have a chance there
 MSmits: got some ideas
 Astrobytes: well, jrk e *did* want you to submit, so he brought that on himself :D
 MSmits: well he wanted to see my solver, it would be cool if it predicts the endgame score halfway through the game
 MSmits: have to get that working too, hope it actually works, didnt do too much verification
 Astrobytes: do all you can without it first I'd say
 Astrobytes: wow, Crazy Remi has a crazy lead
 MSmits: hmm i dunno. I have 2 ideas and they both requrie a lot of code
 MSmits: will end up with a 3k line bot
 Astrobytes: So be it.
 MSmits: the difference between crazi remi and the rest is really that he prepares for the endgame
 MSmits: as opposed to just playing the endgame out efficiently
 MSmits: he plays the first half and the second half, wheras everyone else just plays the second
 MSmits: you can tell by the way he is giving away so many boxes in the first half
 MSmits: he does this to make sure he has control in the end
 MSmits: it doesnt matter if you're some points behind. All that matters is that you control who gets the big chains
 jacek: sounds like othello, the less the better
 Astrobytes: Given the nature of the game, that makes complete sense
 MSmits: it's more like nim
 MSmits: whomever is the last to make a non-loony move wins
 MSmits: there's some chain counting rule you can use
 MSmits: there have to be and odd number of long chains for p1 or even for p2, or the other way around, i forgot
 RyanGilbert: is twitch being annoying again
 RyanGilbert: my stream isnt showing up
 Astrobytes: I've not delved deep enough to understand the whole thing but yes I got that far. The even/odd thing is related to board size no?
 Astrobytes: RyanGilbert: it would appear so&#160;:/
 RyanGilbert: working now
 MSmits: oh yeah, i think its related to board size 
 MSmits: i never got too far into that part, because i didnt need it for the solver
 struct: it takes around 15 min to show up
 RyanGilbert: anybody want to watch?

 RyanGilbert: he joined
 Astrobytes: awesome
 RyanGilbert:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: enjoy
 Velcoro: got it, Astrobytes, thanks
 OliverReider: hi
 RyanGilbert: Sorry to those in my stream for the end on short notice
 RyanGilbert: I am streaming again now
 Cappefra: lol half of cbs's gold league doesn't even compile
 Cappefra: csb*
 MSmits: old bots
 MSmits: compiler changes and all that
 Cappefra: mainly cause the gold league introduces the second pod so the inputs changes completely
 MSmits: oh right i forgot
 MSmits: thats true ofc
 Cappefra: making legend shouldn't be TOO hard on that contest I guess
 MSmits: well, thats decided by the quality of the top bots
 MSmits: if you're not going to write a search, legend might be difficult to achieve
 MSmits: though i have to admit, i never tried this without search
 MSmits: maybe you can do it with just heuristics
 Cappefra: right, I should have mentioned I meant that cause I saw there's 870 people in legend :D
 MSmits: mmh that's a small percentage of the total number of csb bots&#160;:)
 Cappefra: that's what I think... if you have a decent physics simulation I think you can actually go with just heuristics
 Cappefra: I'll have a go at that and see 
 MSmits: yeah, dont waste too much time on that if it doesnt work
 MSmits: basically, at some point you'll need a search
 MSmits: and if you've never written a search before, csb is not the right place to start
 MSmits: imho
 Cappefra: yeah, it could be a good chance to learn genetic algorithms
 MSmits: GA works
 MSmits: there's a GA starter
 MSmits: if you use that, it might be easier to do
 Cappefra: what kind of search do you mean? I've written a bunch of bfs and beamsearchs... not that it would help here tho
 MSmits: beamsearch is a real search, but relatively simple
 MSmits: I mean minimax for example
 MSmits: adversarial
 MSmits: GA can be adversarial, but its a bit complicated
 MSmits: thats why the GA starter hekos
 MSmits: helps
 Cappefra: have only heard of minimax but haven't tried implementing it
 MSmits: the search is pretty simple, not much code, but its annoying to have to deal with a huge simulation when learning it
 MSmits: also you need to discretize moves
 MSmits: like only consider +18 degrees, 0 degrees and -18 degrees
 Cappefra: especially cause it must be hell to debug without a debugging environment, am I wrong?
 MSmits: hmm yeah, the physics sim is hard to debug. But the GA starter already has it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/inoryy/csb-ai-starter">https://github.com/inoryy/csb-ai-starter</a>
 MSmits: you need to adapt it
 MSmits: it doesnt work right out of the box
 MSmits: afaik
 MSmits: i never tried, i wrote my own search
 MSmits: btw if you don't know inoryy, he is our resident Deep Mind employee&#160;:)
 Cappefra: oh :O that's cool
 Cappefra: I was thinking of going c++ this time but I always end up being lazy and choosing c#&#160;:/
 MSmits: c++ in CSB will triple your simcount
 MSmits: compared to C#
 MSmits: if you're just looking to get into legend, this doesnt matter
 Cappefra: btw as a fun fact: a stupid bot that just compiles and isn't event able to calculate the angle between two vectors (cause it was given until gold) gets you to ~ 1900/5900 gold
 Cappefra: anywyas! Thanks for your help, I better go to bed since I'm negatively crossing the 6-hours-sleep mark
 MSmits: yeah go sleep, gn&#160;:)
 struct: MSmits today i fixed the bug
 struct: Of reusing the states
 struct: It was off by 1&#160;:/
 MSmits: before or after the fix?
 struct: before
 MSmits: ah ok, congrats
 MSmits: always nice when a nasty bug is fixed
 struct: Thanks
 MSmits: I hope i'll be able to put my solver into D&amp;B tomorrow
 struct: Now Im learning imgui so I can code a local arena
 MSmits: I should easily be able to calculate the value to decide to keep control of the board or not, but picking the right chains to open is messy. I have to break open my negamax function
 MSmits: oh nice
 MSmits: i do this with windows forms only
 MSmits: do you just want results or also graphic stuff?
 struct: graphics
 MSmits: ahh ok, i never went that far
 struct: like sliders to edit params and such
 MSmits: oh ok, i do use buttons and such
 MSmits: gui stuff
 MSmits: i meant more like, circles and lines denoting parts of the game
 MSmits: like recurse does with his programs
 MSmits: so you can do strategic analysis of your games
 MSmits: as opposed to just win/draw/loss/score
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Q4eQHGm.png">https://i.imgur.com/Q4eQHGm.png</a>
 struct: This was just for test
 struct: board is randomized
 MSmits: yeah thats what i meant
 MSmits: that goes further than what i do
 struct: ImGui is what re curse used I think
 MSmits: really?
 struct: Never asked, but the gui looks similar
 MSmits: he should have a lot of software to choose from, could be anything
 struct: Well ubisoft uses imgui
 struct: So I guess he has some experience on it
 MSmits: ah then you're probably right&#160;:)
 tibithegreat: yep, Imgui is pretty cool
 MSmits: the only visual stuff i coded that actually produced finished products are little programs in python turtle&#160;:)
 MSmits: like a TTT game and such
 MSmits: oh and i guess some modding for 3D game
 MSmits: but next week i'll be coding yavalath in unity&#160;!
 struct: Never used unity
 struct: Is it simple?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: and free mostly
 tibithegreat: as far as game engines it's pretty easy to use
 tibithegreat: not great on performance tho
 MSmits: if you make less than 100k off your product you dont pay anything
 struct: Nice, for UE I think its 1Mill
 MSmits: tibithegreat you use C# so you can do anything that C# allows you to do
 struct: Unreal engine
 tibithegreat: MSmits yeah not a lot of triple-A games written in C#
 MSmits: You can call DLL's
 MSmits: code part of it in C++
 tibithegreat: but at this point it's no longer easy to use&#160;:)
 MSmits: true, but that's always the tradeoff :0
 tibithegreat: at some point you're investing too much into making unity be something that it isn't
 tibithegreat: it's great for indie games and low-budget
 MSmits: depending on your project, yeah
 tibithegreat: and mobile
 MSmits: no doubt
 tibithegreat: but afaik no AAA companies use it
 tibithegreat: except for small projects
 MSmits: well i dont know enough about unity to properly defend it's ability to produce AAA content, but you're right, for small stuff it's perfectg
 MSmits: not too small though
 mr.x: some moderator online?
 struct: Tomorrow I must restart my search on how I will be able to run my smashthecode compiled inside c++
 MSmits: tiny projects should be python probably
 struct: yes mr.x
 tibithegreat: there is also some of the work mike acton has been doing there
 tibithegreat: to make it more data-oriented coding
 MSmits: whats that tibithegreat?
 tibithegreat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&amp;ab_channel=CppCon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&amp;ab_channel=CppCon</a>
 tibithegreat: it's a guy that used to work for insomniac
 tibithegreat: he had a cool talk a few years ago at cppcon but most people kinda mocked him there
 tibithegreat: but then unity hired him and he's been focusing on improving the performance there
 tibithegreat: and bringing these idea of "data oriented design" there
 tibithegreat: it boils down to: don't write your code so it's easy for you to understand, write so that it's easy for your machine to understand it and run it
 mzbear: Unity is good for quick prototyping and getting started fast, which is why it works for small teams. For larger games, they usually need to rewrite pretty much everything that Unity provides
 MSmits: ahh ok
 tibithegreat: mzbear did you work with unity in the last years?
 mzbear: not recently.  i'm actually boycotting them
 tibithegreat: after the job system was introduced
 mzbear: they have betrayed my trust twice
 tibithegreat: I used to work in unity like 5 years ago when I was still doing indie
 mzbear: the first time they betrayed me, they kept sending me spam and when i unsubscribed they later sent more, and mail headers suggested they had a separate mailing list for people who had unsubscribed from their spam
 tibithegreat: lol
 mzbear: the second time, i was going through privacy settings, and clicked a link to check privacy settings for some new profile thing ... and that link automatically created account on their linkedin style site
 mzbear: and that account couldn't be removed and it couldn't be hidden, without having the entire unity account deleted
 MSmits: nasty
 mzbear: the assholes published my real life place of residence associated to my real name, because i clicked to view privacy settings
 tibithegreat: hmm, maybe the bussiness of a commercial game engine for indie studios isn't as profitable as one might think
 tibithegreat: these sound like desperate user retention actions
 mzbear: ever since then, i haven't touched unity, and i'm still upset at them
 mzbear: yeah, obviously i wasn't their customer, so they wanted to turn me into their product instead
 MSmits: i wonder if these are deliberate attempts, or just fails/mistakes
 tibithegreat: could be
 tibithegreat: human stupidity is more often that not the reason for a lot of stuff we attribute to malice
 MSmits: obviously their goal is not to piss off all the devs using it
 mzbear: doesn't seem like a mistake to me, they just don't respect people who aren't bringing them money
 tibithegreat: I don't think most devs check privacy settings that often
 tibithegreat: or unsubscribe from stuff
 tibithegreat: I just let it go to spam and never care about it
 MSmits: I got an e-mail from quora earlier today
 MSmits: I wanted to unsubscribe
 MSmits: below the mail, instead of unsubscribe it just said: "this is a legal mail sent to our users"
 MSmits: I could be pissed off at this, but i feel this is stupidity also
 mzbear: well, they spammed me with newbie stuff repeatedly because i selected that i was beginner with unity.  they spammed quite a lot iirc, enough to annoy me after 3 or 4 mails
 struct: Well sometimes is stupidity, other times is on purpouse
 struct: Did you read terms of service of Yavalath MSmits?
 struct: its in the statement
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: why
 struct: Im joking
 MSmits: oh hok
 MSmits: btw, board games have no copyright unless you use names
 MSmits: if i want to sell my yavalath I need to name it differently
 MSmits: hence the lavalath :P
 struct: They can only copyright the name?
 MSmits: well other than that, it is only the hexboard and the game mechanicas
 MSmits: you cant copyright those
 MSmits: at least not in the US, there was some court ruling
 MSmits: thats why there are so many versions of the board gane monopoly
 MSmits: game
 mzbear: in addition to name, shapes can also be copyrighted, but only if there's enough originality.  a hexagon obviously doesn't qualify
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: im safe, for now
 MSmits: personally i would not enjoy stealing it. If i were to sell anything, i would add something to it
 MSmits: but for my game design assignment i dont really care
 MSmits: i just want to pass
 struct: Yeah, im not selling anything
 struct: Im just promoting their game
 MSmits: right
 struct: I dont think AI coding will steal potential buyers
 MSmits: it wont 
 MSmits: I might buy it
 Emmaplayz: what is the  most easyest code 
 MSmits: at some point
 mzbear: well, using the same name might be an issue from a trademark point of view
 MSmits: he asked permission
 struct: no, I did not
 struct: But he was ok with it
 MSmits: he asked forgiveness
 struct: I told hm 3 4 was also solved
 struct: him*
 MSmits: he didnt know&#160;!?
 struct: IIRC he only knew about 4 4
 mzbear: they have to either give you permission, or tell you to stop using it.  otherwise the trademark has a risk of becoming a generic
 MSmits: cool&#160;:)
 struct: Good thing its made by unnamed codingamer
 MSmits: yeah, will they fix that?
 mzbear: once the trademark is considered generic, anyone can sell the game with the original name, as long as no original content (such as rulebook in verbatim) is copied
 struct: They created a bug for it, but its not urgent
 struct: I can still update the game, euler tested it
 MSmits: ah cool
 MSmits: anyway i gotta go, gn guys
 struct: time for me aswell
 struct: gn everyone
 MSmits: gn
 LastRick: night
 Stigma: is anyone lagging as well&#160;?
 Czihi: af
 Czihi: cant even test code in clash xP
 Stigma: goes nice with my fast mode clash of code :C
 Stigma: i think the bot literally won.
 Stigma: is bitwolf a bot&#160;?
 Czihi: Literally
 Czihi: there are like 10 people
 Czihi: That i see here
 Stigma: oh god
 Czihi: No matter when i log in
 Czihi: Bitwolf, that guy with spirited away avatar
 Czihi: And some more
 Stigma: yh
 Czihi: Idk if they are bots or what but wtf xD
 Czihi: AlkhilJohn aswell tbh
 LastRick: oh its that time of night for updates
 Stigma: they are
 Stigma: XD
 Stigma: my years old python 2 Gitc is still rocking silver 
 LastRick: best way to tell if they are a bot is level 7, but look at their profile. It will usually say it is a bot
 Stigma: jeeeez lag is still going ;_;
 Czihi: yeah
 Czihi: time to stop clashing xP
 Czihi: I just realised
 Czihi: I play only with bots anyway
 Stigma: ive been getting some players
 Czihi: So its a bit less exciting xD
 Stigma: XD
 Stigma: i havent played in a long while and when i want to this happens
 LastRick: just remember its always this time of night (or day) depending on where you live
 Stigma: really?
 Stigma: i used to play at this times
 Stigma: these*
 LastRick: for the last few weeks yes
 Stigma: feels bad
 LastRick: yes, wonder if its permanent
 SwagColoredKitteh: y'all qts
 Illedan: Anyone else starting to code in the online IDE just to test something, while later having regrets to not set it up properly? -.-
 Emmaplayz: what the hardest game
 SwagColoredKitteh: @Illedan oh hai long time no see
 SwagColoredKitteh: o i guess the @ isnt needed, gosh havent been here for a while
 Skynse: level 31 goddess
 SwagColoredKitteh: Emmaplayz depends on who you ask

 Skynse: my trig failed me
 SwagColoredKitteh: hard question uhh, i don't know?
 Emmaplayz: k
 Illedan: hi swag
 SwagColoredKitteh: how're you?
 IfIHadATail: when you say game what are you referring to? like to do you mean a game you play against someone else or like a solo practice puzzle? 
 Illedan: Modelling chess for a search bot is kinda pain :thinking:
 Illedan: Fine, trying the new puzzle from reCurse
 Illedan: And you?
 Emmaplayz: like a solo practice puzzle? 
 mzbear: made a bandas bot to run BFS for decisive moves only ... i run 1.6M sims to see decisive wins from 8 ply away.  i don't really want to slap MCTS on this though
 Emmaplayz: that was easy
 Emmaplayz: whos younger then 16
 Emmaplayz: and a girl
 IfIHadATail: I'm 37 and guy does that count?

 Emmaplayz: your 30 something play bingo
 Emmaplayz: 37
 mzbear: no need to be rude

 Emmaplayz: why sus
 Skynse: like, you just came all of a sudden asking for everyone's age, but didn't specify a reason for that
 Skynse: You could just tell the joke here
 Wontonimo: jump into a clash of code everyone!

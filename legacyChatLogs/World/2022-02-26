 jacek: mhm
 PaarthThePro: 24 game?
 PaarthThePro: Oh I found it
 PhantomKnight_b7c9: Hi, everyone.
 PhantomKnight_b7c9: I received an interview request to take the training. I finished it but can not find the link for that. Any tips about it?
 5DN1L: You should ask the interviewer/recruiter for the link
 PhantomKnight_b7c9: He just asked me to do the hardest challenge and I took one of them
 PhantomKnight_b7c9: But how can I share that with him?
 5DN1L: which one
 PhantomKnight_b7c9: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1</a>
 5DN1L: You'd better ask what they need for proof. Maybe they need the link to the puzzle, your solution code, and a screenshot showing you have passed 100% of the validators
 5DN1L: Honestly I have no idea what they need
 PhantomKnight_b7c9: Oh, got it. Thanks.
 5DN1L: You're welcome

 jacek: oO
 darkhorse64: :innocent:
 Magmi: good jokes 
 darkhorse64: just kidding you
 Stroffen: Hi, how are you? I have a question
 darkhorse64: Hard times. I need to laugh a bit.
 Stroffen: If I am learning Python3 and I do Clash Of Code, I can improve?
 jacek: try easy puzzles
 Stroffen: 'Cause I enter to Clash Of Code and I understand what I sould do, but I don't know how to code it
 JohnWick007: @darkhorse64 Laugh
 Stroffen: Yes? there are? 
 Stroffen: @jacek
 Stroffen: I think that aren't exists
 jacek: hm?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 jacek: try The Descent, Temperatures, Horse-racing Duals, Power of Thor
 Stroffen: Ok. Thank you
 Stroffen: I doing The Descent
 darkhorse64: I do not think you can improve as a programmer playing CoCs. Thinking properly and speed do not match
 Stroffen: So, what can I do?
 Husoski: Study, practice, repeat.  Try to find a way to have fun at it.
 Stroffen: Ok, thank you
 darkhorse64: Solving puzzles will give you thinking pattern and ultimately make a faster coder
 darkhorse64: patterns
 Stroffen: Excellent, tanks
 Stroffen: thanks*
 Husoski: Oh, yes, and after you finish look at published solutions of others.  Try to see how those work.
 Stroffen: Good
 Husoski: (after you finish each puzzle)
 darkhorse64: You do not become a good chess player by playing blitz but at longer time controls. Programming is the same
 Stroffen: For example, in The Descent I use a paper and a pencil for write the secuences
 Stroffen: But I don't know how to code it
 Stroffen: Yes, maybe, u can improve your chess if you play rapid, for example.
 darkhorse64: It's likely that you do not master well enough the basics of your programming language.
 jacek: using pen and paper is good&#160;:+1:
 darkhorse64: You need some prior experience to perform well here
 darkhorse64: ^
 Stroffen: So, what can I do to have that experience?
 Stroffen: Go to another page like this
 Stroffen:&#160;?
 Stroffen: Or learn more about Python?
 darkhorse64: follow Python tutorials
 Husoski: About "The Descent", there are only three things to do with each input.  Read the list, find the index of the maximum, print it out.  Which ones are problems for you?
 Stroffen: I use conditionals
 Stroffen: If-else

 Stroffen: i+=1
 Magmi: Guys
 Magmi: I am god speed coder
 Magmi: now
 Magmi: *legend
 Husoski: Stroffen The puzzle input is in a single line of input, and Python's input() function will read that all at once.  ]
 Husoski: Stroffen, In your for loop in the 2nd snipped, you have "a = i + 1" followed by "if i &gt; a:".  How can i be greater than a, which is always i+1?
 Stroffen: okey
 Husoski: Another site might be useful for you to get practice with basic coding ideas.  CodeWars.com, for example, has problems graded in 8 levels (opposed to 4 here) and offers them to you based on your past performance.
 Stroffen: Excellent. Thank you a lot
 Husoski: I used CodingBat.com to practice little coding ideas, but that site was still Python 2 last I looked.  Doesn't matter much for string/list/logic problems though.
 Stroffen: Ok, thank you
 Stroffen: I going to try to practice with CodeWars
 Stroffen: And then I will compare with CodinGame
 Husoski: Come back here, though, since the interactive puzzles will help you get used to event-driven coding. 
 Husoski: I'm Husoski at CodeWars, too.  I go there to work on Ruby sometimes.
 Stroffen: Excellent, Husoki, thank you a lot!!
 Stroffen: I already have a CodeWars account
 StraumliPerversion: how do me learn clojure?
 5DN1L: By solving 592 puzzles in clojure?
 StraumliPerversion: oh, okay I'll try that
 StraumliPerversion: paging Wontonimo to #fr
 Wontonimo: what's going on in fr?
 StraumliPerversion: they need help with your puzzle
 Wontonimo: thanks
 Wontonimo: oh, that resulted in a fix to my puzzle.  Thanks again StraumliPerversion
 eulerscheZahl: as a Canadian, do you speak French?
 Wontonimo: I'm supposed to.  The education system sure tried and gave resources.  I unfortunately had severe language issues as a child, so was pulled out of French class to focus on being able to speak English
 Wontonimo: I didn't start speaking until i was about 5.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tabernak
 jacek: speaking, who needs that :unamused:
 Wontonimo: I started programming when I was 8, started reading when I was 9.  Parents were confused
 Wontonimo: they thought I was pretending to not be able to read because I was using programming books to program
 Wontonimo: they were super angry
 Wontonimo: so i showed them how I identified where the code was in the books because of the formatting, and how I just copied it in like it was some kind of unintelligible spell
 Wontonimo: and how i figured it out from trial and error
 Wontonimo: two of the first words I learnt to read and write were PRINT and GOTO
 jacek: like some mindless mimicking
 jacek: or cargo cult
 Wontonimo: exactly, plus experimentation, and as much of a scientific method as an 8yr old can do
 jacek: welp i also relatively late learned to speak
 jacek: but mostly becauses i didnt want to. human interaction is heavy exhausting for me
 Wontonimo: you and me both
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, my parents were mad when I made a long distance phone call to find out what ASCII meant.  I thought it was ASC 2.  We didn't have proper computer books
 Wontonimo: lol.  speaking of which, I'm going on a walk in the forest now.  see ya later
 jacek: only the improper ones :v
 Wontonimo: no humans in the targeted forest
 Wontonimo: hope everyone is safe from the war
 Wontonimo: later
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you speak in the forest... nvrmnd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: we only had computer/electronics magazine subscriptions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and couldn't afford it
 Husoski: At least you had that.  We had Glamor and Look.
 Husoski: I didn't get to touch a computer (except for the TicTacToe machine at Disneyland) until freshman year at college.
 jacek: ultimate tictactoe machine?
 Idk.-_-: hi guys
 Rebollo: Guys, I am getting an error, cause I a trying to modify a property of a pointer
 jacek:&#160;!
 Rebollo: But I am checking if is not nullptr
 Rebollo: the prblem is that is not actully
 Rebollo: null
 Rebollo: it has a value like 0xCDCDCDCD
 jacek: not initialized?
 Rebollo: hum 
 Rebollo: maybe
 jacek: give it nullptr during initialization, otherwise it will be some random
 Rebollo: let me check
 Rebollo: you are right
 Rebollo: solved!
 jacek: :tada:
 Rebollo: thanks!!!
 Rebollo: if I have some strucure like this:
 Rebollo: varA-&gt;varB-&gt;varC-&gt;varD
 Rebollo: i have to check
 Rebollo: if(varA)
 Rebollo: other if I check direclty varA-&gt;varB
 Rebollo: and varA is null i got an error
 Rebollo: is there a correct way to deal with it?
 AdemDj12: what u using java i think&#160;?
 Rebollo: c++
 jacek: dunno how in c++, you probably need to null check every time
 Rebollo: like I need to check like this
 Rebollo:  if(newNode)
 Rebollo: because if i check  if(newNode-&gt;previous) direclty and newNode is null
 Rebollo: I got error
 jacek: in kotlin youd use something like varA?.varB?.varC?.x
 jacek: dunno if something like that exists in c
 jacek: c++
 Rebollo: humm
 Rebollo: nice let me do a search
 jacek: or if there is elvis operator
 tdyere: shat uap man
 5DN1L: you too
 jacek: oO
 AdemDj12: lol who poked him
 VizGhar: he came from parallel universe
 Rebollo: the better and only way is:
 Rebollo: if(parent==null || 
 nulte: a loop?
 Rebollo: or
 nulte: while (node) {node = node.child;}
 Rebollo: what if I have more the 2 levels
 nulte: that will go N levels
 nulte: until node is null
 jacek: the question is what you want to achieve
 Rebollo: just avoid if after if
 jacek: do something on the leaf?
 jacek: then while until null or one step earlier is good to go
 Idk.-_-: guys
 Idk.-_-: i have 1 question
 Idk.-_-: i've installed vs code newwhen i'm running c++ code in itits running on output not terminal
 Idk.-_-: what is the problem&#160;?
 nulte: windows or linux?
 jacek: 'yes'
 Idk.-_-: windows
 nulte: hmm no idea then
 nulte: I use vscode on windows but its connected to wsl2

 jacek: Automaton2000 do you like tacos
 Automaton2000: some thing to scroll the chat if you want
 nulte: im doing amazonial
 jacek: bored with onitama eh
 MACKEYTH: What's your strategy nulte?
 nulte: I will try minmax
 nulte: still no strategy
 nulte: I need to code the engine
 nulte: jacek kinda out of ideas for the moment
 MACKEYTH: Wontonimo's gotten me onto a Monte Carlo obsession.
 nulte: I can try mcts too but 50ms might not be enough for it
 jacek: lets monte carlo everywhere!
 MACKEYTH: I have been getting better results with straight monte carlo than with MCTS
 nulte: o.o
 nulte: that should not happen
 MACKEYTH: That may be down to language choice, though. Java seems to waste a lot of time on garbage collection when you have a tree going.
 MACKEYTH: I just don't get as many rollouts with MCTS
 datu12: hey guys 
 MACKEYTH: Hey
 datu12: just a question to solved marsh landing
 datu12: Do i just need to write a loop?
 MACKEYTH: Mars Lander?
 nulte: episode 1?
 datu12: yep
 datu12: yes
 nulte: you just need an if else
 datu12: Says write an action using printf
 nulte: inside the while loop that is given to you
 datu12: oh the comments tricked me lol
 datu12: I dont need to change the prnitf statement do I?
 nulte: well the printf is used to output the action you want to do
 nulte: So you might need to change it
 MACKEYTH: You can use the one in the template code, but you'll need to change it to output your instructions
 datu12: Yeah copy
 datu12: Thank you all;
 MACKEYTH: 45 min wait to be promoted to Silver&#160;:(
 jacek: where
 MACKEYTH: Line Racing
 jacek: oh my
 Aland_52879: hey guys, is there a way to debug the code line by line and and get the values at certain phase of the game?
 jacek: print to stderr
 MACKEYTH: No debug tools in the web IDE, sadly. Like jacek said.
 Aland_52879: ohh thanks&#160;:( 
 MACKEYTH: I try to work inward when debugging. return the values in the outer loop, identify a failure state, then conditionally output the values from the next loop in, etc
 Aland_52879: the problem i get while debugging is sometimes it says cant process siteId which i dont know how it happens
 jacek: huh
 MACKEYTH: Not familiar with that one
 ArvisCeirulis: Heey. Im a junior c# dev looking for an escape room partner :D hopefully someone not an expert coder so that we both have to think :P
 ArvisCeirulis: anyone who hasnt done it who would be down?

 Wontonimo:&#160;?!?!
 Idk.-_-: somone can't help me&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that's a statement with a "?" at the end.
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry Wontonimo but you can only award tacos once per day
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry NicolasDiniz but you can only award tacos once per day
 Magmi: Sharing source code should be mandatory, not optional!!!
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: i think microsoft and apple would argue differently
 Magmi: ...
 Magmi: ALl Competitive source code should be open source&#160;!! no discussion
 AdemDj12: no i dont think so , there is some exclusive code golfs stuff that cant be shared
 AdemDj12: and you have to accept that
 Wontonimo: is a hotdog a taco?
 Wontonimo: more importantly, what multis are people working on&#160;?
 jacek: is mayonnaise an instrument
 Wontonimo: no patrick

 PatrickMcGinnisII: where do we fart roosters? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0 among input data. if two ...
 Wontonimo: I wish I new more French.  My basic understanding is limited to talking about desks, pencils, and times of day
 JohnWick007: The code snippet below is synchronous. It calls callback1 one time and callback2 three times. You must modify this code to make it asynchronous with the following rules:

 Magmi: Any reason I can not see how a particular Clash of Code game impacted my rating???
 Husoski: Magmi you can look at your rating before and after (use the leaderboard from the vertical... menu or click the button from the CoC entry screen)
 Magmi: Husoski ok but why not make it more friendly
 Husoski: Not my design, just offering a workaround.

 Rebollo: I am trying to intialize a tree with n children per node
 Rebollo: I am getting stack overflow
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24782f97-2251-4a6c-9c0b-fdcac410bd14">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24782f97-2251-4a6c-9c0b-fdcac410bd14</a>
 Rebollo: I am trying to use recursion because I don´t know hoe to initialize n X n X n nodes
 Rebollo: so everytime I create a child
 Rebollo: I call the function again passing it
 Rebollo: to fill the other childs
 Wontonimo: i'm looking at your code, give me 2 min
 Rebollo: :raised_hands:
 Wontonimo: what is this for?
 Wontonimo: looking at the code i don't see an obvious way that it doesn't end.  looks like it will always stack overflow
 Rebollo: but I am debugging step by step
 Wontonimo: i'm guessing tree is a global
 DaNinja: I wouldnt use recursion for adding children, it should be possible with a loop
 Wontonimo: ^^ +100
 Rebollo: but I have many children, that have many children, that have many children
 Wontonimo: let's say you want your recursion to only go 5 deep, or N deep.  Add that as a parameter, like depth=5, and when it recursively calls itself pass depth-1 and don't call if depth == 0
 nulte: What is this for?
 DaNinja: so loop on the children and recurse on the childrens child
 Rebollo: let me try the deph param..
 Rebollo: Nija but I am doing that
 DaNinja: yep I see now, your code looks ok in that case
 DaNinja: but  your tree.root is being replaced at every new child
 Rebollo: but but it enter the roor part only if the root is nullptr which is only in the first time..
 Rebollo: the next times just add the childs to the parameter node..
 DaNinja: why do you have initTree(*iter)?
 Rebollo: because is a list o *Node
 Rebollo:      list&lt;Node*&gt; children;//array will keep children
 DaNinja: it add balls forever
 antiwonto: [auto] DaNinja be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>

 Rebollo: but I add a depth now
 Rebollo: but still not working

 Rebollo: If I initialize the DEPTH with 3 seems to work ok
 Rebollo: bu as soon as I initialize with 8 or 10
 Rebollo: seems to loops infinite
 Rebollo: is it too much combination?
 Rebollo: 10 childs has 10 childs  = 100
 Rebollo: 10 times
 linjoehan: try printing some stuff to stderr like nodes visited and time then you can see what it's doing
 nulte: how big is your child?
 Rebollo: 10
 nulte: sry how big is your node
 nulte: how many bytes
 Rebollo: hum
 Rebollo: don´t know
 nulte: cerr &lt;&lt; sizeof(Node) &lt;&lt; endl;
 Rebollo:    string key; //data for storage
 Rebollo: maybe
 Rebollo: 10^10
 Rebollo: is the total of nodes
 nulte: that is way too much
 DaNinja: stack will overflow
 Rebollo: 10.000.000.000
 Rebollo: nodes
 nulte: too much yeah
 nulte: is this on CG?
 Rebollo: no
 Rebollo: local
 Rebollo: visual studio 2019
 nulte: yeap its too much
 nulte: even 10^9 is too much
 Rebollo: I see
 Rebollo: I don´t even need that much
 Rebollo: but I didn´t realize that the size increase exponetialy this case
 Rebollo: I was doing a generic stuff
 Rebollo: does have a goal
 Rebollo: just to learn a few concepts
 nulte: also you probably want to use vectors instead of lists
 Rebollo: I was trying with vector no success
 Rebollo: but probably the same issu
 Rebollo: will try again
 Rebollo: 10 is too mush even with vector but makes sense
 nulte: even if your node was 1 byte each
 nulte: you would need 10'000MB for 10^10 nodes

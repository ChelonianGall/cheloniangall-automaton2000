 JJWooster: what's the most obscure language supported by CG that you know?
 JJWooster: obscure might not have been appropriate working
 JJWooster: anything less than mainstream, I guess that is what I'm trying to get at
 BLucky: I don't know about obscure but VB.NET and bash surprised me a bit

 PotatoPrime: anyone know some good resources? I kinda miss the part where we get an explenation as to what would be the answer/or solution 
 PotatoPrime: kinda get stuck on puzzles and clashes

 Jerrasterix: how about we use levels... Only those above level 5 can access chat, atleast we can reduce the chat :rolling_eyes:
 struct: guys do something useful instead of spamming, go to #pt chat if you have any questions
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm currently trying to push something related to my management Jerrasterix
 [CG]Thibaud: current threshold is level 3
 TheFireCubeInSpace_7296: buon salve
 Jerrasterix: nah, make it 5 minimum
 Uljahn: i guess external clients let you ignore the minimum level requirement 
 struct: also 3 or 5 wont chance much imo
 Jerrasterix: these are silly kids who don't know about xmpp clients
 [CG]Thibaud: yup. We're brainstorming about something harsher
 eulerscheZahl: you can also get around the level limit by opening a replay in a new tab and then using the top bar navigation links (e.g. forum) to get a chat window
 eulerscheZahl: even easier than an external client, isn't it? and more likely to happen by coincidence
 Jerrasterix: :thinking:
 Uljahn: didn't know that
 eulerscheZahl: never tried - but works when you are not logged in at all
 eulerscheZahl: read-only chat in that case
 [CG]Thibaud: I didn't know it worked that way ^^
 eulerscheZahl: CG has a lot of Easter eggs

 struct: keyaru I think you should learn the basics first though

 eulerscheZahl: oh, pastebins are back
 keyaru: eh eh thank, and you're right I've alresdy started this game 
 Koala-Gentil: any chance codingame add lodash to available libs in javascript&#160;? :rolling_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: not impossible but not likely either
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Not a priority.
 quasi_ubique: Anyone know whats up with javascript regex? /[aeiou]/gi was giving different results when assigned to a variable, compared to console logging the results.
 Westicles: Koala-Gentil, ask on the Feature Request channel #fr
 struct: quasi_ubique do you have example code to show it?
 struct: it should be the same I think
 quasi_ubique: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jsfiddle.net/zbxqyveo/1/">https://jsfiddle.net/zbxqyveo/1/</a>
 quasi_ubique: S would be an input string like "aeiouyz". 
 struct: var reg = /[aeiou]/gidoes this really work?
 struct: I never saw it before
 quasi_ubique: yeah it should work. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://regexr.com/69ie5">https://regexr.com/69ie5</a> you can test it out
 struct: I always usedvar reg = new RegExp(/[aeiou]/,'gi')
 quasi_ubique: ahh
 quasi_ubique: I've seen that before, but too many characters for some shorter ones
 makerecho: it is equivalent
 makerecho: or well, should be
 struct: I see, this goes beyond my js abilities 
 struct: what does this do?
 struct: r:reg.test(c)
 quasi_ubique: I'm console logging an object variable. the r property will show the result of reg.test(c)
 struct: what is this code supposed to do btw?
 struct: delete every vowel?
 quasi_ubique: Yeah
 struct: I think there is simpler way to do it
 struct: str.replace(/[aeiou/gi,<i>);</i>
 struct: lag?
 Westicles: hey euler, are you going to update the NS python script?  everyone has been asking about it
 Westicles: apparently it stopped working right before the contest

 Westicles: so each time you clear cookies you need to replace that long value?
 eulerscheZahl: no, each time you sign out

 Sibertron99: You are in a Mathematics class. The teacher has just taught you how to add, multiply and square. Now, the teacher gives you x numbers n (x is odd) and asks you to find the product of the sum of odd numbers and the sum of even numbers. Furthermore, he wants you to add the square of the middle number to the result. To prevent cheating, he wants you to show your steps in this format:Sum(even) x Sum(odd) + middle^2 = result

 Astrobytes: I should probably just leave again lol

 eulerscheZahl: alright, do you want to talk about it?
 Manjius: rickrolling being a bannable ofense seems fair to me
 Astrobytes: lol, no, just not suffering fools gladly today
 eulerscheZahl: it's okay when trolls have to suffer too
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too nice most of the time and always feel bad for banning
 eulerscheZahl: mostly, there are exceptions
 Astrobytes: i've never felt bad for any bans or kicks
 Astrobytes: The bad part is that it has to be done so often!
 Magus: I've never felt bad for any ban or kick. Except this time when euler kicked Automaton2020.
 Magus: :D
 Magus: Wtf ..
 Magus: he crashed again ...
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: 2020
 eulerscheZahl: you pinged the wrong bot

 UnnamedCodinGamer: but if you are not doing offline training, you need speed, or?

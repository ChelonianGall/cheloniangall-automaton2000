 HistoriCode97: Hello everyone
 AlPaca: o/ good morning
 AlPaca: we basically got the same solution, histori
 AlPaca: i just shaved a little more off variables and indentation
 Presac: Does a page with statistics/history of clashes exists?
 Neumann: Is there a way in the player to move one substep at a time&#160;? (i.e. in 2048, go 1 move forward/backward when 1 frame contains N moves)
 wlesavo: i dont yhink threr is other than play button
 wlesavo: lol those typos
 Neumann: :D
 Presac: It's so annoying when people better than you don't post their code in clash

 Uljahn: Intp: clash invites are not welcome here, please post it in #clash
 derjack: o:
 AntiSquid: actually could just join one of the clash streams and player their viewer games ... if you really just want to play with others Intp
 AntiSquid: play *
 hpa: hi, I'm new here I get timeouted on hello world because of `ERROR: ld.so: object 'libstdbuf.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored`
 hpa: could someone point me where should I look for a solution
 Uljahn: hpa: this could be related to your issue<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/bug-report-power-of-thor-episode-1/187020">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/bug-report-power-of-thor-episode-1/187020</a>
 hpa: thanks for reply, it is the issue, but there is no solution there. I'll try to investigate it myself
 darkhorse64: My experience is that you should not have timeouts because of this (internal) CG error. It's most likely that your program does not answer in due time
 hpa: yep, you are right, I outputed the answer to stderr, thanks for help
 Shadowtick: hello
 Saaalikh: Ello
 Saaalikh: The website is just great ive been playing coc day in and out, have learnt a whole lot of new things. Just keep a pen and notebook with you and observe other's code and all the possibilities of solving a question just blows out my mind
 Drakkhonian: holy cow i finally did the logically reasonable inequalities easy exercise
 Drakkhonian: you guys sure thats easy level? cause i had to use recursion for it lol
 Uljahn: check community solutions, there could be more simple approaches
 Drakkhonian: i think ill do that before going for the next one lol
 Drakkhonian: thx
 GabbyGirl: hi
 Mucahit: hi
 Shadowtick: I think I might become level 36 quicker than I expected
 darkhorse64: Only 22K XP to score. Easy
 eulerscheZahl: why 22k?
 eulerscheZahl: from lvl 0 to 36 requires 32k
 eulerscheZahl: and he already has about 16k
 darkhorse64: level 22 is 10K
 eulerscheZahl: oops, my bad. somehow i looked at level 26 instead of 22
 darkhorse64: No
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Morgoth1st: Wow
 Morgoth1st: Im lowly lvl 10
 Morgoth1st: Pleb status
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, we'll judge you by your contest rank
 Morgoth1st: That makes me feel better
 Morgoth1st: I think
 eulerscheZahl: only 2.5 weeks, hype intensifies
 darkhorse64: This is all gamification. You progress fast at the beginning and it gets much and much harder when you're hooked
 eulerscheZahl: and that's the point when you should start creating community contributions
 eulerscheZahl: and keep them WIP for a bit
 darkhorse64: In this respect, JBM has been a very efficient farmer
 eulerscheZahl: 21 more upvotes and the contribution is worth as much as creating a whole contest :D
 eulerscheZahl: from my own, limited experience creating a contest is a hell lot of work
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: joined the kutulu team 2 months before the contest, game was mostly finished. still a lot of time invested in balancing, polishing up, thinking about corner cases
 darkhorse64: Whereas writing a board game is quite simple (if you discount any fancy animations)
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to farm, CoC contributions have the best XP/effort ratio
 AntiSquid: when is JBM releasing the game lol
 darkhorse64: No game design (already done). 
 AntiSquid: but how do you know your coc isn't repeat
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/85832923a7f501f77a5bc337f8b2c96df0067d">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/85832923a7f501f77a5bc337f8b2c96df0067d</a> solitaire Q_Q
 eulerscheZahl: for CoC duplicate questions are officially allowed
 darkhorse64: How many XP for a Coc, puzzle&#160;?
 AntiSquid: lol funny 
 eulerscheZahl: 250 for any approved contribution
 eulerscheZahl: +10 per upvote
 eulerscheZahl: i complained about it 2 or 3 times on the forum, then gave up
 eulerscheZahl: obviously a full blown multiplayer requires more effort and skills than a CoC
 eulerscheZahl: and I think also adds more value to CG
 darkhorse64: ^
 AntiSquid: harder to stream doing multi than coc
 eulerscheZahl: i used adblock to remove that streaming from the top bar :P
 AntiSquid: only 1 person streamed a multi so far .
 eulerscheZahl: i saw Haash i (fantastic bits) and someone with "tomato" in the nick (kutulu) within the last week
 eulerscheZahl: that's 2 in my counting. and i didn't check the streams 24/7
 Astrobytes: yeah I saw the haash i one, no others
 Astrobytes: Be the change you want to see AntiSquid :P
 eulerscheZahl: the tomato guy had a bug in his A*
 AntiSquid: tomatoes 
 eulerscheZahl: creating new node instances all the time but not implementing Equals
 eulerscheZahl: so he never reached the target node
 AndrewRIGHT: Это пиздец&#160;! тут русские есть?
 eulerscheZahl: go to #ru
 AntiSquid: see&#160;? harder to stream multis
 Astrobytes: lol, I didn't watch the haash i one because there was no mic apparently...
 AntiSquid: might be bulgarian
 AndrewRIGHT: Thanks!
 AntiSquid: nvm
 Astrobytes: Watching a silent stream must be enormously painful
 eulerscheZahl: i heard some French speaking on the haash stream
 Astrobytes: Yeah it was later at night, his wife was in bed apparently so no mic
 AntiSquid: Това е прецакано! Има ли руснаци тук? - bulgarian for reference . i mean i can't tell the difference
 eulerscheZahl: which is the same as silence for me
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and Go is the new puzzle of the week. But not the multiplayer version of it
 AntiSquid: "If at least one of the moves in the list is not valid just print: NOT_VALID." =_=
 Shadowtick: I am gonna get off so bye everyone have a great day
 AntiSquid: helped him out
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it. is that justified by moderation guidelines?
 AntiSquid: he is spamming that
 AntiSquid: too often
 AntiSquid: we had a long conversation about it . he promised he would stop this bs
 C_Boy:         if(strcasecmp(&amp;word[i], &amp;word[i+1])) {
 C_Boy: what wrong with this?
 LexFlex: Hi guys! I'm new to CG and pardon me for stepping in, is there a way to use the DevTools of Chrome in order to debug the code while the game is running? I saw there is an official extension to use in order to export/import the code in others IDEs but I need the DevTools only for the moment... is this possible?
 LexFlex: Thank you guys
 darkhorse64: No, you cannot debug your bot code under CG except by printing smth on the stderr console
 AntiSquid: read comments in the starting code how to debug LexFlex
 darkhorse64: Is "i" within array bounds&#160;?
 C_Boy: yes, I just kept getting valid=1 in result?
 darkhorse64: strcasecmp returns 0 if chains are equals.
 eulerscheZahl: do you want to check if they are equal or not equal?
 eulerscheZahl: and i was too slow
 darkhorse64: I beat you with my slow fingers&#160;!
 Pouria2100: Hello
 eulerscheZahl: was switching tabs
 Pouria2100: Anyone uses brave here?
 darkhorse64: no bad excuses
 Pouria2100: or duckduckgo?
 <b>**eulerscheZahl uses Chromium</b></p><p><img src="/a/44990769450746" /> AntiSquid: brave what? OS&#160;? browser&#160;? ... etc
 AntiSquid: oh nvm thought there was brave OS lol
 LexFlex: Ah ok, thanks... @AntiSquid so do you mean using the suggested "console.error('debug...')"...That's a pity :disappointed:
 LexFlex: Thank you anyway!
 AntiSquid: yes that is the one
 AntiSquid: but you can output quite a lot with it
 eulerscheZahl: or set up an environment locally
 AntiSquid: what are you doing? you could setup offline and print to file (what i do sometimes)
 eulerscheZahl: for the full debugging experience
 darkhorse64: The easiest is to copy paste the input into a file and read this file while debugging. This way, you do not need to change your bot code. An even more advanced way is to save your state in a bitstream and read that stream back. This is extremely powerful but you need to instrument your code to do this
 darkhorse64: In contests, it sometimes saves your skin
 eulerscheZahl: meh, for the most cases that level of compression is total overkill
 darkhorse64: Yeah, most of the time, console output is enough. 
 darkhorse64: The last time I used bitstream was for UTG for debugging suicidal bots
 eulerscheZahl: i don't remember the input per turn being that large
 darkhorse64: Here I needed the game state
 darkhorse64: I mean my game internal state
 eulerscheZahl: ah. in this case i just replay the whole match offline until i reach that turn
 LexFlex: I usually use a lot of breakpoints and "watch expressions" while the code is running... I'm still a rookie in program developping so I really like to tear down  the code and understand its behaviour "step by step"
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 darkhorse64: Bitstream is only a snaphot at a given time when you may need a whole sequence
 C_Boy: my bad in end!
 eulerscheZahl: i get the idea of a memory dump to debug with
 darkhorse64: Highly recommended reading
 Pintago: hello , i got a probleme with the puzzle&#160;: stock exchage loses . all my test are ok , execpt the 5, i don't why he don't works

 Pintago: i put what i do in C++
 Pintago: if u can help me&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: lol, my solution does not work anymore for test 5
 Pintago: ooh&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: mine still passes
 LexFlex: Thanks @eulerscheZahl for the link!
 LexFlex: Really worth reading it
 darkhorse64: This test has many values. Brute force is defeated
 eulerscheZahl: at some point stock exchange didn't check all corner cases. they modified a testcase
 Pintago: what&#160;?
 VizGhar: He just said that your solution was incorrect even back then :D
 Pintago: ok ok xD
 Pintago: but i don't know how to do it else
 Uljahn: i guess that while-loop is excessive, one for-loop is enough
 Pintago: ok ok i got some idea with just the for but i don't know if it will change a lot 
 Pintago: thanks for yours advises
 VizGhar: you can solve it in linear time, just a single for/while loop... but I assume it is not failing because of "timeout" right?
 jacek: woo new puzzle of the week
 jacek: oh its puzzle not a game
 Pintago: thank you i finish this puzzle :D
 MSmits: hey, anyone want to try something i put in my AI course?
 MSmits: it's basically interactive BFS
 MSmits: If you want to try, go here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2f3651108d">https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2f3651108d</a>
 MSmits: (click to place black walls, space bar to switch mode, then the turtle finds the path)
 MSmits: i think i removed most of the bugs. 
 MSmits: the code is probably still a bit crappy
 eulerscheZahl: i placed the walls, then clicked the play button
 eulerscheZahl: walls are gone
 MSmits: no you need to press run first sorry
 eulerscheZahl: what should i click instead to run the BFS?
 MSmits: run, then click on the squares to place walls, then click on empty squares to send the turtle there
 MSmits: (sorry after you switch mode with space bar)
 eulerscheZahl: clicking on empty sqaures adds more walls?
 MSmits: yes sorry
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 MSmits: space bar first
 MSmits: i'll add this explanation for the students
 MSmits: they also dont see the code
 MSmits: just the grid
 eulerscheZahl: seems to work, well done
 MSmits: yeah thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: I will add steps where you see explored cells change color
 MSmits: as the algorithm runs
 eulerscheZahl: as you said BFS: is there any visualization?
 MSmits: like the one on redblob games
 eulerscheZahl: other than the final path
 MSmits: this is just the first animation to get them to wonder how it works
 eulerscheZahl: ok, race condition at typing
 MSmits: i will add one that shows the steps
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: once you get one to work, the others are easy
 MSmits: python + turtle isnt the easiest when you're using it for visualization
 MSmits: it's good for learning coding, not good as a visualization tool
 eulerscheZahl: summary of my CG SDK experience
 eulerscheZahl: the "not easy to start" part
 MSmits: the thing is, stuff like pygame and tkinter and such doesnt really run in the browser and needs all sorts of installs
 MSmits: so i dont have that many options 
 eulerscheZahl: javascript
 MSmits: yeah, but i want to keep using python
 MSmits: because the students only learn python
 MSmits: i want them to be able to look at my code if they want to
 eulerscheZahl: "they also dont see the code"
 MSmits: yes, not in this version
 MSmits: but i will be making multiple
 MSmits: for different purposes
 MSmits: in one case they will build up the BFS logic themselves
 MSmits: so everything will be hidden except the actual BFS logic
 MSmits: i will add an extra thingy for A*, using the same base 
 MSmits: for fast students
 MSmits: I'm happy i found a way to visualize though. I am also thinking about the traveling salesman problem and teaching them greedy/hill climbing/SA/GA with that
 MSmits: should be easy to visualize
 MSmits: GA would just be some dials where they set the values and see how good the solutions become
 eulerscheZahl: don't forget ants for the TSP
 MSmits: what is ants again, i vaguely remember
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms</a>
 eulerscheZahl: this adds a bit of domain specific knowledge to the problem
 eulerscheZahl: that is the triangle inequation
 MSmits: that is awesome. I actually have 2 students who are doing they last year thesis about swarm intelligence
 MSmits: this is an example of that right'/
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: ah right the wiki says so too
 MSmits: thats great. I really need to code one of those, because it will allow me to help these guys better
 MSmits: you just added a whole new section to my AI course :P
 eulerscheZahl: whoops :D
 MSmits: I'm doing this course in a  closed system my colleague built up. But I'm enjoying this a lot. I might create an open system for it later
 eulerscheZahl: a CG contribution
 MSmits: hmm it's more tech.io I think?
 eulerscheZahl: probably yes
 MSmits: i will probably do something like that at some point
 eulerscheZahl: a Cat likes to create puzzles. but some are just about implementing a known algo and might seem boring for codingamers
 eulerscheZahl: for me: tech.io = learning
 eulerscheZahl: codingame = fun part
 MSmits: I think probably acat has students with more coding skills. I have to be real careful about that
 MSmits: we allow everyone to choose CS in my school. Also students who dont do any natural sciences/math
 eulerscheZahl: he's at a university. your students are younger
 MSmits: well that too
 eulerscheZahl: and you pinged him
 MSmits: the thing is though, some of my students could easily follow his class
 MSmits: i have a huge range in skill among my students
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: makes it hard for you as a teacher
 eulerscheZahl: either it's too challenging or boring
 MSmits: yes, but it also makes the resulting material really good and flexible
 MSmits: if you make it work that is
 MSmits: you can't get lazy about anything
 eulerscheZahl: giving grades gets challenging too, doesn't it?
 MSmits: it does, but usually it works like this. Everyone who obviously worked at it gets at least the lowest passing grade and it goes up from there, asymptotically
 MSmits: students that arent very good, but also dont work for it, might get low grades and not pass
 MSmits: it's not easy to calibrate, but you adapt 
 eulerscheZahl: but if you have less previous knowledge, it will get harder to get a good grade. as you apply the same standards to every student
 MSmits: the nice thing is that there is no national exam, so I set the bar. The bar might be lower or higher at another school
 eulerscheZahl: the curse of a class with mixed skills to begin with
 MSmits: yes
 inoryy: why not set a higher baseline bar and give some references to prerequisite materials
 MSmits: but my goal is always for them to learn new things and the guys/girls who are good at it, usually think it's fun so it doesnt matter for them that they automatically pass even if they do nothing. They like it so much they will keep going
 inoryy: there are 1000000 intro to programming courses online, no?
 MSmits: inoryy yes, but this sort of thing also requires a baseline of skill. Also some of them dont read English very well
 eulerscheZahl: that's also a school decision, not only a teacher decision, isn't it?
 inoryy: wait what age range are we talking
 eulerscheZahl: 16-18
 MSmits: hmm usually if there is no national exam, it's entrusted to the teachers
 MSmits: 15-18 mostly
 MSmits: my classes are often at the high range of this
 MSmits: the school leadership only gets involved when things go wrong and students/parents complain
 MSmits: usually
 MSmits: with a national exam, they also get involved, but only when the grades are too low
 inoryy: shouldn't English be a very high priority by this point?
 MSmits: of course and many of them know English fairly well, but not all
 MSmits: some struggle with it
 MSmits: especially the kind of English a  programming course would use
 inoryy: fair enough
 MSmits: my AI course is in Dutch, though i am trying to leave some part of the coding in English
 MSmits: it is hard to translate some stuff and keep it easy for them to google
 MSmits: inoryy do you know of any machine learning examples that train quickly enough that you can do it live?
 inoryy: of course, what kind of area are you looking for?
 MSmits: have a class of students all play a game against a system and watch it get smarter? Or do you need too many games 
 MSmits: could be any game
 inoryy: oh, a game
 MSmits: i think maybe even TTT takes too many games
 inoryy: does it have to be live? the way most RL lecturers do is by showing snapshots at different iterations
 MSmits: if it's not a game, I could use an AND or OR port with a truth table. Thats easy to train and a useful example right?
 inoryy: e.g. here's the agent at step 0, at step 1000, at step 100000, etc
 MSmits: nah, nothing has to be 
 MSmits: just looking for good ideas is all, snapshots sounds good
 inoryy: I mean I'm sure there is something that could train live as well but can't think of anything flashy off the top of my head
 MSmits: not flashy, but a truth tabel with AND/OR port works right?
 MSmits: table
 inoryy: oh yeah, I'm still talking about games
 MSmits: ah ok, yeah games seems hard
 MSmits: maybe Nim?
 MSmits: Nim can be Q-learned at least
 inoryy: with other tasks you can probably train basic image / text benchmarks to some good score live
 inoryy: like MNIST on a colab
 MSmits: ahh yeah i will for sure put that in
 MSmits: whats nice is that this course really lets me broaden my own knowledge. I tend to dive down the first rabbit hole that crosses my path
 MSmits: now I kinda have to write a GA, do some machine learning etc.
 inoryy: if you don't mind a self-plug I have an example of SC2 based agents untrained&#160;: trained side by side from my bsc thesis project
 MSmits: I would for sure show some YT examples of your agents. 
 inoryy: I'm sure there are better examples but that's what immediately comes to my mind :D
 MSmits: do you have a channel somewhere?
 MSmits: i do remember seeing your stuff, but it's been a while
 inoryy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/gEyBzcPU5-w">https://youtu.be/gEyBzcPU5-w</a>
 inoryy: though note that it's far from the full AlphaStar agent so not as flashy
 LukeCloudwalker: Hey guys, I got sent a test by a potential employer. The test is hosted by this site. Does anyone have any expereiences with this they would like to share? Is it time based? Only coding questions? etc
 MSmits: thanks inoryy
 MSmits: LukeCloudwalker sorry I haven't done this, i know it's time based and you probably have to solve a puzzle or two
 MSmits: if you want to  practive, do some easy, and later on medium puzzles here and try to solve them within 15 mins or so
 MSmits: practice
 MSmits: try to have a good spread in different times
 MSmits: types
 MSmits: string / mathematical / graphs etc.
 LukeCloudwalker: Ok, I hate time pressure :s Are the tasks given medium by default or does the employer chose?
 MSmits: probably employer chooses, but I am just guessing here. I haven't done this myself
 LukeCloudwalker: Thanks for the tips!
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: not sure if they also look at coding style btw. The employer might get to see your code
 MSmits: these puzzles are solvable with horrible coding style of course
 LukeCloudwalker: Wdym? Just how pretty the code is?
 MSmits: readable probably
 MSmits: not verbose, but at least readable
 inoryy: MSmits oh btw for the most basic example this would probably work well? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playground.tensorflow.org/">https://playground.tensorflow.org/</a>
 LukeCloudwalker: I find readable code important so it's probably not gonna be a problem
 MSmits: oh yeah, thats cool, I knew that one inoryy
 MSmits: it's basically data categorization
 MSmits: LukeCloudwalker they will also understand that with time pressure your code won't be perfect
 MSmits: I think even if you fail, you might get to explain what you were trying to do
 Algonaute: @LukeCloudwalker I did one test few years ago. It's time based (more seconds for more difficult questions).
 inoryy: it's classification on 2 classes, to the left you can pick the "dataset" distribution
 Algonaute: but it's not the same as clashes
 Algonaute: *of clans
 inoryy: oh and on top-right you can switch the task to regression too
 MSmits: of code I am guessing
 LukeCloudwalker: Ok, thanks guys
 Algonaute: it is very the same sort of questions in standard interview
 MSmits: it's great inoryy. This one requires an indepth tutorial though, the first time i looked at it, i was a bit stumped
 MSmits: so I might write a section around it, put the thing in an iframe with dutch text next to it
 inoryy: iframe, now that's a word I haven't heard in a long time
 MSmits: hehe... well people do still use plain html&#160;:)
 jacek: iframe? from apple?
 jacek: how much does it cost
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: depends
 MSmits: do you want the iframe 6 or the iframe 10?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits u got the iframeX? :P
 MSmits: nah, it's out of my reach
 MSmits: need to make more :moneybag:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm saving up for a rtx3080
 MSmits: makes sense, you need some massive hardware if you want to get the same performance using PHP
 PatrickMcGinnisII: funny
 MSmits: :grin:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just made GrandMaster using only php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: finally
 MSmits: yeah thats awesome
 MSmits: you may be the best php-er&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nope
 MSmits: notice i did not say highest ranked
 MSmits: rank and skill aren't the same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: puzzlw od the week doesn't look fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, where's my coffee i can't tpe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: type
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Imma switch to java on CG sometime this year, maybe next contest...
 MSmits: would be cool to see what you can accomplish when you aren't fighting for cpu cycles
 MSmits: java should do much better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I could fall flat on my face, but I certainly can't do worse
 MSmits: well if you're good with java you'll do better for sure
 MSmits: I started to like python, but not enough courage to try it for a contest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Gotta rep for the OGs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Only reason I hate PY is 'cause I have to interpret all the stuff in my head to look like C
 MSmits: I mostly dislike the global variable thing
 MSmits: it confuses me
 MSmits: and yeah sometimes the float/int thing
 MSmits: it's much easier to debug than c though&#160;:)
 MSmits: c++ anyway
 TwilightClown_935e: Hii how to play the game this
 TwilightClown_935e: plase tell me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I use it for scripting in some graphics programs I use... It truncs numbers, i lose precision..and I don't know why
 MSmits: yeah that's not fun
 MSmits: you dont get a warning when it decides to make your float into an int
 MSmits: there's some logic behind it and it's probably consistent, but you have to really look into it
 MSmits: i had this problem doing bitboards. It would be a float sometimes and you do not want to bitboard with floats :P
 jacek: bitboard with floats? what is this blashemy
 MSmits: my point exactly
 jacek: floating point
 TwilightClown_935e: suggession any vedio&#160;?
 MSmits: right
 TwilightClown_935e: how to play the game
 MSmits: you cant play the game
 MSmits: you program AI to play the game
 MSmits: why play a game when the computer can do it for you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wargames: "Want to play a game?"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Global Thermal Nuclear War
 MSmits: yep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, now how to cut/paste my Go code into the puzzle of the week
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, clown left
 MSmits: wait, did Trump give up the election?
 jacek: i have functional bot othello but i still havent solved that othello puzzle
 MSmits: meh, you don't have to solve the puzzle, you just have to solve everyone elses bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: FB is saying Biden's kid overdosed, oh gheesh, gotta fact check
 MSmits: damn
 jacek: trump is biden's kid?
 MSmits: wow, I wish I could be this ignorant about the world. you must be much happier lol
 eulerscheZahl: no, Hunter Biden iirc
 MSmits: I know you're kidding :P
 eulerscheZahl: i remember that discussion in the first TV duel between Biden and Trump
 jacek: well with all this abortion protests here
 jacek: why should i care about the others
 MSmits: or about abortions
 eulerscheZahl: Poland is a direct neighbor country and I know less about it than about the US
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, you watched that&#160;!?!?
 eulerscheZahl: the highlight collection
 MSmits: ah, you mean the least-low-light collection
 eulerscheZahl: too much Trump interrupting to watch it in full
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: Automaton2000 can make better sentences than trump
 Automaton2000: i can only see it when i get home
 Manhar: hehehehe

 eulerscheZahl: An error occurred (#548): "Game not found".
 jacek: game not found :c
 jacek: what could it be
 eulerscheZahl: i can tell what it can't be
 MSmits: AutomatonNN that's fake news
 AutomatonNN: emphy power of thor contribution
 eulerscheZahl: power of thor is possible
 eulerscheZahl: let's just say it's Thor

 PatrickMcGinnisII: nope can't confirm HB OD, IG,twitter,FB blowing up tho ... prolly false news
 MSmits: our map is as red as possible&#160;:/
 inoryy: AutomatonNN do you welcome our AGI overlords?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a few more possibilities of moves to the corner and you can also
 MSmits: thats it AutomatonNN, go stand in the corner!
 AutomatonNN: which one?
 inoryy: haha
 eulerscheZahl: do i have to kick automaton again?
 MSmits: lol...
 eulerscheZahl: last time i did, it was afk for a full day
 MSmits: really, is this automatic?
 MSmits: or did someone just turn it back on?
 inoryy: it was plotting revenge
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for the rest of us <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hartvannederland.nl%2Fnieuws%2F2020%2Fcoronabesmettingen-per-gemeente-2%2F">https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hartvannederland.nl%2Fnieuws%2F2020%2Fcoronabesmettingen-per-gemeente-2%2F</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no idea if magus restarted the process
 eulerscheZahl: but the kick was covered by moderation guidelines
 eulerscheZahl: i repeatedly told Automaton not to ping me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's got your #
 PatrickMcGinnisII: number
 inoryy: AutomatonNN should be given mod right and taught to /kick
 AutomatonNN: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that again :D
 inoryy: haha what
 eulerscheZahl: fancy unicode
 inoryy: why would that be in the training set
 MSmits: this reminds me of those AI videos where the reward isn't properly calibrated or the simulation has a bug and they start to break things
 MSmits: somehow it liks this unicode thingy
 jacek: trolling is pretty rewarding
 MSmits: likes
 MSmits: yeah if you want attention it is
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's a bug, Agade has no explanation why it should print that  ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺ͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩͩ 𓀐𓂸

 Cybgy: How can I use CG chatbin?
 Hjax: just paste directly into the chat, messages above a certain length go into the pastebin
 Hjax: assuming its working todya 
 Hjax: today*
 Cybgy: okay thanks will try
 Hellivium: About weekly challenge, could you confirm me there are or not a mistake in game rule implementation&#160;? I've heard only edge count as surrounding, not diagonal cells
 Hellivium: Oh&#160;! Nevermind ...
 jacek: :o
 jacek: YurkovAS still spam submiting bandas?
 YurkovAS: jacek find small performance improve.
 YurkovAS: jacek you store board state in tree nodes or recalculate each time?
 jacek: i recalculate everytime
 YurkovAS: store board states in separate big array (not in mcts tree node) give good performance improve.
 jacek: bitboard?
 ickoice: I'm new here, is this chat task specific or global?
 YurkovAS: yes, compact state with uint8_t
 jacek: ickoice global
 ickoice: thanks
 jacek: how may we help you, Sir/Madam
 Mr.Roi: whats up
 AntiSquid: yes
 jacek: Automaton2000 what is the best game in this site
 Automaton2000: but then it's just a matter of time
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 but which one
 Automaton2000: but if you just want a tshirt
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 yes
 Automaton2000: and i'm working on that
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 where I can get tshirt?
 Automaton2000: when you read the input
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 which one?
 Automaton2000: lol i didn't even notice

 sneusse: is it just me or is the "small code" challenge basically a "i can code ruby or I loose" challenge?
 Aliot2000: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14367761b040ee9d4cada7923d90836fa6baf9f">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14367761b040ee9d4cada7923d90836fa6baf9f</a>
 JavonCity: sneusse, bash is short too haha. But basically. So I like to check every code by language to compare on private clashes
 sneusse: well c#/c/c++ remains pretty useless
 sneusse: can I filter for only the reverse challenges?
 JavonCity: its good for bitwise&gt;
 JavonCity: on private clashes you can filter
 sneusse: ah ok
 LastRick: Not on public
 sneusse: thx
 sneusse: They should add "most" efficient or "least cycles" :D
 miracle: IMHO the reverse challenges are not really helpful for improving coding skills.
 sneusse: actually none of them are&#160;:)
 LastRick: but they are helpful for understanding  algorithms
 sneusse: maybe except fastest
 sneusse: imho most of them are more like random puzzles
 JavonCity: anybody up for private? we can do some reverse?
 miracle: The fastest mode requires quick problem understanding and problem solving (albeit not necessarily efficient). The shortest mode sometimes requires finding the simpliest solution as well as exploiting language features that one might not be aware of.

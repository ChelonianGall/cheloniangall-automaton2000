 JohnCM: jiayou
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 Icebox: moin :wave:
 EvModder: mornin!
 EvModder: i'm entirely rewriting my bot today lol
 eulerscheZahl: i should rework my harvesting&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: and codejam this afternoon
 Icebox: what?
 Icebox: is it?
 Icebox: isn't it romorrow?
 eulerscheZahl: round 2 is today
 Icebox: oh I'm trolling, kickstart is tomorrow
 Icebox: mb
 EvModder: best of luck on codejam&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i hope to reach top1000 tehre
 Icebox: unrealistic goals again, huh? :eyes:
 Icebox: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm much stronger on CG than in these short rounds
 morning_cloud: :robot:
 Icebox: same tho
 Icebox: I mean you saw my usefulness in reply challenge 
 eulerscheZahl: i take you over unihedron everytime
 Icebox: I'm lit in clashes tho
 Icebox: those are "short rounds" as well
 Icebox: :D
 Icebox: same but different 
 eulerscheZahl: and fewer strong competitors
 Icebox: ah my head is going to explode smh
 Icebox: I should start like
 Icebox: sleeping
 eulerscheZahl: still awake?
 Icebox: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm already awake :D
 Icebox: ofc you are
 Icebox: like a clock every morning 6am
 eulerscheZahl: and the bird is at my window, asking for a peanut
 eulerscheZahl: recently i got a squirrel coming too
 Icebox: what are you
 Icebox: a disney princess?
 eulerscheZahl: and my cat slapping against the window from the inside

 VicHofs: pac1 huge brain play at frame 42 tho
 thethiny: I was timing out because....... I was printing a long list
 Gonny: what's the website to compare different versions of our bot against a set of players?
 thethiny: 106-48 against Inky
 VicHofs: anyone have a tweak to get pacs to do the same as blue pac 2 here?
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465066206">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465066206</a>
 VicHofs: from frame 30-66
 eulerscheZahl: the blue pacmen are doing horribly
 eulerscheZahl: going in every deadend for a few pellets instead of taking the long corridor at first
 VicHofs: well considering they beat me I take it you're not a fan of mine lol
 VicHofs:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: at least you got 3 of the superpellets
 VicHofs: lol ye it's a priority in my algo
 jrke: hey whats priority?
 VicHofs: umm
 VicHofs: are you joking or...
 WINWINWIN: exactly what it sounds like jrke
 jrke: K
 jrke: no i am thinking its any other thing sorry&#160;:)
 VicHofs: like I'm not trying to be mean lol are you serious or nah
 VicHofs: oh ok
 VicHofs: no I don't mean it as a coding term or anything kek
 jrke: K
 eulerscheZahl: if you rearrange the letters in jrke a little, you obtain "jerk"
 VicHofs: yeah potassium is fucking dope jrke
 jrke: yeah euler
 VicHofs: ...is that the point?
 thethiny: can I see behind an enemy?
 thethiny: if he's halfway can I see behind him?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 VicHofs: I think so thethiny
 thethiny: okay thanks
 VicHofs: I think you can do it even if not "halfway blocking" the los
 Kellthazar: What is your rank now thethiny?
 lifetimeLearner007: how much time is it taking for u guys to calculate distance from every cell to every other cell?
 eulerscheZahl: 20ms on large maps
 thethiny: @Kellthazar I didn't submit yet, but I'm 76 in Bronze
 VicHofs: what u got going rn @thethiny
 thethiny: @lifetimeLearner007 30ms
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db2ed205-ae67-4680-aa2e-180206088ae1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db2ed205-ae67-4680-aa2e-180206088ae1</a>
 VicHofs: lifetimeLearner007 not doing that
 Kellthazar: 230 ms (to read and create my "board" object")... There is a lot of points to improve.
 thethiny: @VicHofs I can now beat Inky but that's without using SWITCH or avoiding collisions, nor using line of sight. I just assume all pelllets are there. I will patch those first
 WINWINWIN: Does BFS need to be optimized to reach that speed or is it b virtue of language?
 eulerscheZahl: you have to start the timer after reading the input
 thethiny: in C++ it's like that, in Python you need too many optimizations
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise you measure time for your opponent and server activity too
 VicHofs: Yeah I'm doing the same lol
 thethiny: Good luck Vic
 VicHofs: ty @thethiny u too&#160;:)
 VicHofs: you know I passed you earlier lol
 thethiny: good XD
 Kellthazar: WINWINWIN, You only need the BFS to get all the paths, after this, you can use the paths to do all kind of calculation
 eulerscheZahl: WINWINWIN i didn't optimize my BFS at all. was fast enough the way it was
 thethiny: you're using C++ that's why
 VicHofs: but now I "fixed" some stuff and dropped all the way to 550 lmao
 thethiny: @VicHofs you can do it :D
 VicHofs: ty @thethiny È†ëÂºµ„Çã„Çà
 thethiny: me too
 thethiny: È†ëÂºµ„Çã„Çà
 Kellthazar: I implemented a kind of awareness range for my bots and my code is worse now XD
 VicHofs: „Åà„Åà„Åà„Åà„Åà„Åà
 thethiny: I have too many functions that have similar names, I'm lost now, using wrong functions
 thethiny: get_pathget_path_nodesget_path_points
 BenWo: thethiny - how many lines you up to?
 thethiny: and autofill is filling the wrong ones :D
 thethiny: 1145 lines
 BenWo: dang
 WINWINWIN: Using C++ or Java thethiny?
 VicHofs: „Å™„Çì„Å†„Çà„Åù„ÇåÊó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÇíÁêÜËß£„Åß„Åç„Çã„ÅÆ„ÄÄÁ¨ëÁ¨ë
 thethiny: Python
 thethiny: @WINWINWIN
 thethiny: I'm only using Python cuz I don't wanna deal with Pointers
 thethiny: yet all I'm doing in Python is pass by reference 
 thethiny: :D
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 VicHofs: oh WINWINWIN is someone's user lol
 thethiny: ikr
 VicHofs: I was starting to wonder why y'all kept saying that lol
 thethiny: took mew a few tries to find out
 WINWINWIN: Yes, it is meant to be irony :D
 thethiny: WINWINWINLETS WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Kellthazar: 803 LoC at the moment
 VicHofs: cause u loseloselose?
 eulerscheZahl: in i was waiting for you to just to #1 at the end of the contest&#160;:(
 WINWINWIN: all the time :P
 DavidTheNewKid: All I do is lose, take these L's like a champ&#160;:)
 DavidTheNewKid: All I do is lose, I take these L's like a champ&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 VicHofs: me too DavidTheNewKid
 VicHofs: up top
 VicHofs: It's like a hobby to me at this point
 thethiny: after a few turns the number of output lines reduces :O
 thethiny: in stderr
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't depend on the number of turns but how much you have printed in total
 BenWo: must have used up your allotted errors already
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465082813">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465082813</a>
 lifetimeLearner007: can we find distances from every cell to every other cell in 1ms? Is that possible?
 VicHofs: hey eulerscheZahl you're a veteran here
 eulerscheZahl: true
 VicHofs: got a simple way to deal with trailing pacs?
 Kellthazar: BFS Flood fill before the loop lifetimeLearner007
 eulerscheZahl: what are trailing pacs?
 VicHofs: like a pac of mine going after or very close to another
 VicHofs: thus they don't cover area well enough
 lifetimeLearner007: Kellthazar, will that reduce the time to 1ms?
 VicHofs: idk what to do exactly
 eulerscheZahl: ah, clustering
 thethiny: trailing he meant like same path
 VicHofs: yeah that
 thethiny: 1-2 steps away freom each other
 thethiny: @VicHofs in my herustic I give 5 penalty for the pacs
 VicHofs: idk what that means lol
 eulerscheZahl: the easiest generic solution would be to simulate the whole thing and reward keeping some distance
 lifetimeLearner007: VicHofs, commanding a pac by checking if this path is overlapping with already commanded pac and then change the path??
 VicHofs: reward?
 thethiny: if grid.get(node) == -2: self.f += 5
 Kellthazar: lifetimeLearner007, no, but you only need to calc one time. After the calculation, you can store the result on a data structure to use in your bot logic.
 thethiny: @VicHofs the F value
 WINWINWIN: @lifetimeLearner007 there is a 1000ms allowance on the first turn, why not precompute it?
 eulerscheZahl: a scoring function that gives bonus points for not being too close
 VicHofs: *c0nFus10n 1nt3nS1f13s*
 WINWINWIN: So something like score += sum of each pac distance from the other?
 eulerscheZahl: i reimplemented parts of the game engine
 lifetimeLearner007: Kellthazar, WINWINWIN, I'm precomputing it  and its taking 90ms. I wasn't sure if that was reasonable. So asking if it can be done even faster like just 1or 2 ms
 eulerscheZahl: so i test a move and obtain a new board state
 eulerscheZahl: i do the same for several possible actions
 Kellthazar: The C++ guys can do it in 20ms I guess...
 thethiny: in order to beat the game, you have to beat the game
 WINWINWIN: Is that even needed lifetimeLearner007? when we have 1000ms on the first turn how is it possible to timeout?
 thethiny: make*
 VicHofs: yeah lifetimeLearner007 thing is I'm not doing paths üòÇ
 eulerscheZahl: then i look at each board and take into account how many pellets i collected in total and such
 VicHofs: I just pick the destination
 eulerscheZahl: you can add distance between your pacmen too at that point
 lifetimeLearner007: WINWINWIN, I didn't say I was timing out. I was just trying to improve the time taken. Was curious if it could be done in 1 ms even cpp. I just got to know that its 20ms with cpp. Not sure if that's the best we can do though
 WINWINWIN: K, Ive heard something about a Dijkstra algorithm being used for that, dont know how to use it
 lifetimeLearner007: VicHofs, in that case, maybe u need better pellet tracking
 eulerscheZahl: BFS does the job here. dijkstra has some extra features that you don't need and is slower for this grid
 lifetimeLearner007: Diijkstra isn't necessary, simple bfs suffices, WINWINWIN
 VicHofs: lifetimeLearner007
 VicHofs: how so?
 WINWINWIN: ok
 lifetimeLearner007: exactly eulerscheZahl. I learnt that the hard way by implementing it and timing out. lol
 VicHofs: I have BFS rn to find the closest target
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 VicHofs: (works for different items and entities)
 VicHofs: what the function returns is just the destination though
 VicHofs: is that a problem?
 BenWo: So how often does CG run challenges like this?
 Kellthazar: My first contest was coder strike back
 Kellthazar: pretty funny
 lifetimeLearner007: VicHofs, the destination of first pac is to be considered as no pellet b4 calculating destination of second pac which would trail. Then, it'll no trail that much, mayb 1 or 2 cells
 DavidTheNewKid: I've been doing a lot of clash of code, and I just don't find the reverse problems that enjoyable.
 Kellthazar: I think the schedule is a new contest after 3 months I guess... BenWo
 BenWo: oh, that's a long gap
 VicHofs: I am doing that lifetimeLearner007 lol
 VicHofs: maybe I'm just unlucky in that sense
 VicHofs: but I'm trying to figure something else out
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can still play most of the older contests. just without the possibility to win prizes and with less active players chatting about it
 BenWo: right
 BenWo: I like the time limit though
 thethiny: @eulerscheZahl u good in python?
 eulerscheZahl: mediocre
 thethiny: may I ask u to assist me in sth?
 VicHofs: what's sth?
 thethiny: something
 VicHofs: oh ok lol
 eulerscheZahl: why me? i'm busy
 thethiny: because you seem like you can catch typos on the fly
 VicHofs: I'm good in Python if you need help with the language
 VicHofs: not the algos tho lmao
 thethiny: def __mod__(self, point): self.x
 thethiny: this is giving me error
 thethiny: says int does not have x
 VicHofs: is it in a class?
 thethiny: called Point
 VicHofs: that class needs to have an attribute x
 VicHofs: does it have that&gt;
 VicHofs:&#160;?
 thethiny: it does, but why does it say "int"?
 BenWo: yeah, would need a bigger chunk of the code to debug that one
 VicHofs: yeah
 VicHofs: can you send a snippet?
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/idY0LFY">https://imgur.com/idY0LFY</a>
 VicHofs: can we see the attributes too?
 thethiny: error is here
 thethiny: return Point(self.x&#160;% len(point[0]), self.y&#160;% len(point))
 VicHofs: I gotta see how you defined them
 thethiny: @VicHofs which attributes
 VicHofs: of the class
 VicHofs: cause def __mod__ has to be in it right
 thethiny: what does attributes mean
 Gonny: you have len(point) and len(point[0])
 Gonny: they are not consistent
 thethiny: it is a 2D array
 Gonny: are you missing a [0]?
 VicHofs: attributes are the variables shared by instances of a class
 thethiny: self.var in init?
 VicHofs: yep
 thethiny: def __init__(self, x=-1, y=-1):
 thethiny: what's weird is that the line before the last is calling the last line
 thethiny: return Point(self.x&#160;% len(point[0]), self.y&#160;% len(point))
 VicHofs: Did you instantiate the class as an int by any case?
 thethiny: nope, it is working fine in another function
 thethiny:             if grid:
 thethiny: this is working fine
 VicHofs: a method for the same class?
 thethiny: yes
 VicHofs: huh
 VicHofs: idk what could be going wrong then
 VicHofs: what's the error out again?
 thethiny: int does not have x attribute
 VicHofs: huh
 VicHofs: well unless you defined the instance as an int idk what could be wron
 VicHofs: *wrong
 VicHofs: you defined the __mod__ method inside of the class, right?
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: I found the problem but not why it's happening
 VicHofs: well idk then
 thethiny: apparently point.x contains another point
 thethiny: instead of an int
 VicHofs: oh
 VicHofs: well I guess I lack context
 thethiny: adjacent_point = Point(1, 1) + Point(1, 1)
 thethiny: adjacent_point&#160;%=  grid
 thethiny: this returns (2, 2)
 thethiny: which is fine
 thethiny: position = Point(1, 1)position += Point(1, 1)
 thethiny: position&#160;%= grid
 thethiny: gives error
 VicHofs: isn't that essentially the same thing though
 thethiny: it is
 VicHofs: idk what to tell ya fam
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/MfjLGjN">https://imgur.com/MfjLGjN</a>
 VicHofs: what am I looking at here
 thethiny: the error function that called&#160;%
 thethiny: error at position&#160;%= grid
 thethiny: it's a pointer issue
 Kellthazar: Well.. time to go to bed.
 thethiny: start is an object
 thethiny: position = start 
 Kellthazar: Good luck everyone
 thethiny: reference
 thethiny: goodnight
 VicHofs: valeu boa noite @Kellthazar
 VicHofs: @thethiny yeah I got the function
 VicHofs: But I can't seem to put my finger on it
 thethiny: I'm gonna try and let you know once I find the issue
 VicHofs: ok
 VicHofs: gl
 VicHofs: Imma head off to bed too
 VicHofs: 3AM and what not
 thethiny: yeah man found the issue FFS
 thethiny:     def __init__(self, x=-1, y=-1):
 VicHofs: oh yeah?
 VicHofs: what was it?
 thethiny: I'm passing a tuple without *
 VicHofs: oh you meant to initialize it with a tuple?
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: I guess I forgot that
 VicHofs: oh ok
 VicHofs: I figured maybe it was on purpose with a transformation later on lol
 VicHofs: anyways peace out yall
 VicHofs: gl hf
 thethiny: goodnight you to
 thethiny: too*
 thethiny: I'm timing out in arena, but locally it's working fine??!?!?!
 thethiny: sth is wrong I just hit replay again and it works
 thethiny: server issues?
 thethiny: Inky just time out, wtf???
 thethiny: timed*
 HKTran: I was 6th in bronze league, then I submit again with an improvement, now it's 22nd&#160;:(
 [Csongor]: ):
 [Csongor]: I was yesterday 810th now I am 890th.
 jrke: HKtran don't worry iwhen i was in bronze my rank was fluctuating from 5-200 one submit one submit 5 and one in silver same code
 thethiny: guys I swear I time out in arena but not offline
 thethiny: I mean in IDE
 thethiny: I bet serve is busy cuz my BFS time went from 0.3 to 0.9 in the same stage
 thethiny: server*
 eulerscheZahl: how do you know it's the same server?
 eulerscheZahl: is it in the same match?
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: I just hit replay in same conditions
 thethiny: sometimes I time out sometimes I don't
 eulerscheZahl: CG has different servers. you can't be sure which one you hit
 eulerscheZahl: from 2.2GHz to 3GHz i think
 thethiny: so that means some servers are slower than others?
 thethiny: but that still doesn't explain the jump from 0.3 to 0.9
 eulerscheZahl: there's always some variation in time measurement. but 0.3 to 0.9 is huge indeed
 jacek: happy Caturday
 SurajMishra2209: time out for same scenarios in arena but not in ide
 SurajMishra2209: *awkward*
 BenWo: I'm definitely at the point where I'm winging it here, lol
 SurajMishra2209: does crying help?
 BenWo: definitely not
 SurajMishra2209: inky loves to see me crying -_-
 SurajMishra2209: from 34 to 324 in bronze
 SurajMishra2209: pretty motivating
 BenWo: you must have really improved the code to drop that far&#160;:-P
 BenWo: that seems to be how it works, lol
 SurajMishra2209: this time out thing is definitely not helping
 <b>**BenWo crosses fingers</b></p><p><img src="/a/44247984870201" /> thethiny: my RNG is always producing a number that ends with multiples of 4
 thethiny: what even
 AVD: So are you saying the timeout isn't code related, rather server problems?
 SurajMishra2209: I don't think it is...sent the parameters and tried in ide...worked fine
 SurajMishra2209: but in arena timeout
 Quidome: It is possible that you have a different match, try a few times more in the IDE 
 Quidome: because of random things 
 eulerscheZahl: and when you are close to the 50ms, it's definitely possible that you timeout sometimes but not always
 Quidome: I have a situation which i want to replay and only getting it 1 out of 4 matches
 Quidome: And it's on move 15&#160;:)
 SurajMishra2209: alright...I'll try again tomorrow...
 eulerscheZahl: and some players are random. so sending it to the IDE doesn't guarantee to play the same game again
 AVD: Can you write out the time it took to process your code with Console.Error.WriteLine?
 SurajMishra2209: 4 am is definitely not the right time to code
 eulerscheZahl: true
 Quidome: Sweet dreams&#160;:)
 SurajMishra2209: :nerd: 
 klforthwind: can the map loop up and down?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 klforthwind: awesome, ty&#160;:)
 BenWo: ugh, got an infinite loop somewhere I think
 TinfoilSaint: infinite loop go brrr
 BenWo: ok how do I run this crap locally
 BenWo: I'm dying to be able to step through this mess
 WINWINWIN: print inputs to stderr and run in a local ide?
 Csipcsirip: calm down euler
 TinfoilSaint: I just have a local test suite that I run locally
 TinfoilSaint: So when I bug hunting I use my test suite to do it
 eulerscheZahl: sorry Csipcsirip
 eulerscheZahl: for this game local debugging needs the full match history

 Rprades: euler on top!
 eulerscheZahl: random luck i think
 EvModder: either way, congrats
 eulerscheZahl: arena: 54   Pacman: 78   draw: 20
 eulerscheZahl: arena = old version, pacman = IDE version that i just submitted
 eulerscheZahl: numbers: how often it wins
 EvModder: it has been 18 hours since my last submission and frankly im terrified to do it lol
 Csipcsirip: wow you test before submit? 
 eulerscheZahl: you don't?
 eulerscheZahl: but only vs myself
 eulerscheZahl: no online benchmark
 Csipcsirip: nah, for me hte submit is the test :D 
 eulerscheZahl: too random
 Csipcsirip: easier to get crashy replays
 EvModder: i test in IDE by copying games i lost and trying to figure out if i can win them
 eulerscheZahl: right now i'm just boosting the hungarian trio
 eulerscheZahl: i catch crashes too in my local testing
 eulerscheZahl: but i increased the time limit a bit
 EvModder: how do u increase the time limit o.O
 eulerscheZahl: modified the referee code
 eulerscheZahl: but there's still an upper limit that's not that simple to raise
 eulerscheZahl: so i have 75ms instead of 50
 EvModder: where is the referee code?
 eulerscheZahl: linked at the bottom of the statement

 WINWINWIN: very well done eulerscheZahl considerable lead as 1st
 WINWINWIN: 1.2 points
 eulerscheZahl: too early to celebrate. but it's better than the previous version&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: as long as royale doesn't do anything stupid, you are right :D
 WINWINWIN: :P
 solaimanope: any suggestion for qualifying for legend? I have been trying different ideas for last four days and nothing seems to bring great improvement
 EvModder: what are some things you've tried? have you looked at games you lost for bugs or things to improve?
 thethiny: My losses are only due to time out&#160;:(
 EvModder: huehue i've been there
 solaimanope: i have tried low quality sim for example not visiting a cell more than one time when choosing path; choosing path for one pac at a time
 solaimanope: I have tried different profit calculations for shortest path
 solaimanope: none seems to work
 EvModder: how about your combat prowess?
 solaimanope: i don't have any attacking strategy. I might be able to code to trap an enemy pac in some trivial case but I am not sure if it will do any good.
 kovi: if legend is the goal look weakness on the boss
 eulerscheZahl: that attitude is exactly why i never want to be the boss
 struct: Nice euler, good luck for the rest of the contest :pray:
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. been there a few times, never lasted till the end
 struct: 4 hungarians in top 10
 struct: damn
 struct: all from budapest
 eulerscheZahl: nixerrr where are you?
 eulerscheZahl: your country needs you
 eulerscheZahl: Csipcsirip from budapest too
 struct: yeah he is currently on submit
 struct: he is top 10 too right?
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes
 Brokolis: Do you guys write in local IDE or in the online one?
 eulerscheZahl: offline
 struct: local
 ashelkov: VSCode
 struct: offline yeah*
 struct: by local I meant on my machine
 eulerscheZahl: with multiple files that i merge into 1 on build
 struct: ^
 Brokolis: Makes sense
 struct: I also have template that generates some functions so I dont rewrite them everytime
 eulerscheZahl: i just copied my OoC :D

 persi: Hi guys
 thethiny: I mean... It said so
 persi: I'm a noob in this games
 persi: How I can get better?
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: hypnotoad avatar
 persi: Well, and step2..?
 Insufficient: hey persi&#160;:)
 Insufficient: a good idea is to watch your games and see if you can see your pacs doing things you dont like
 Insufficient: and think of what would be better and try to think of a way to tell them not to do the bad things you see them do
 Quidome: keep it simple, get rid of the bugs before the next feature
 eulerscheZahl: i always struggle to answer these general questions that aren't about a specific issue
 Quidome: You are in Wood 1, correct greedy play should get you into bronze
 eulerscheZahl: go to closest pellet
 Quidome: correct greedy play is hard enough when using speed&#160;;)
 struct: Its hard to answer honestly
 Quidome: Is speed available in Wood 1?
 struct: no
 persi: No
 persi: I think..
 Quidome: aha, sorry about that
 BenWo: hi persi, welcome&#160;:)
 struct: persi just move to closest pellet that isnt already being targeted
 Quidome: good advice
 Quidome: maybe target supperpellets before everythinh
 struct: yeah, target super pellets if dist &lt; n
 persi:  I'll work on it. Thank you all!
 persi: See you on gold!
 Quidome: :punch:
 EvModder: eulerscheZahl im looking at a match in IDE where i eat 4 of 5 of your pacs and you still end up winning
 eulerscheZahl: share it
 eulerscheZahl: losing 4 is a lot
 dbdr: wow, eulerscheZahl #1, gg!what happened?&#160;:)
 EvModder: oop i already pressed play and it got lost, is there a way to view game history for IDE?
 eulerscheZahl: i submitted and got really lucky i guess
 eulerscheZahl: it's gone
 EvModder: rip
 dbdr: aaaaaand...
 eulerscheZahl: i like that southpark reference
 Quidome: yes, a seed history would be very helpfull indeed&#160;:)
 dbdr: write a script for it&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: or not losing your current IDE match on promotion
 Quidome: aha, that's an idea
 eulerscheZahl: or your bookmarks on league opening
 dbdr: bookmarks??
 eulerscheZahl: bookmarks survive. but link to 404 now
 EvModder: here is an interesting one eulerscheZahl:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465191894">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465191894</a>
 dbdr: ah, got that, was not sure it's systematic.&#160;:(
 EvModder: my pac on the left going for the super pellet realizes it is dangerous but only at the last second
 eulerscheZahl: and that, ladies and gentleman is the current #1 _D
 EvModder: but then your pac lets me have it
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 EvModder: your bot is good enough it can afford to be generous sometimes&#160;:)
 EvModder: not sure why it let me have the super pellet on the left, might be worth investigating
 struct: its good, it just means you can still improve
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 struct: also his death doesnt make lot of sence
 struct: ok it makes soem
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/rY89Xk5">https://imgur.com/a/rY89Xk5</a>
 EvModder: yeah it's a bit tricky, check the rules under the game it is formally listed out
 eulerscheZahl: "i'll grab the super pellet later, small ones first"
 EvModder: my bot that got me to gold did that lol
 sgalasso: Hello does anyone have an ideas for prioritize pacs paths without calculating multiple times for the same pac&#160;?
 EvModder: a pellet is a pellet
 EvModder: size doesn't matter
 eulerscheZahl: it does in my code
 EvModder: sounds like a bug&#160;:)
 Doju: My pacs think they're stuck if they end up within the killing radius of an enemy&#160;:/
 BenWo: morning Doju
 Doju: morning
 EvModder: i think my current sumbission has a similar problem Doju
 Doju: or afternoon xD
 EvModder: my pacs get really paniced
 BenWo: my pacs are all broken
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465194920">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465194920</a> frame 60
 EvModder: LOGIC
 Doju: such logic
 EvModder: my pacs use the power of spongebob
 Doju: nobody has as much logic as i do
 BenWo: lol, try using science
 EvModder: but i dont believe in science
 Doju: BenWo i'll try that
 Doju: the word is too long&#160;:(
 BenWo: Science cares not for your belief
 eulerscheZahl: and now it's 50% hungarians in top10
 Peudoki: sneakily I'm also Hungarian
 Peudoki: so 60%
 eulerscheZahl: tht was unexpected
 eulerscheZahl: budapest too?
 Peudoki: not exactly, but close

 Peudoki: I live and study in London though
 thethiny: woohooo
 thethiny: 1000 ranks jump
 perseverent: my BFS is not getting me out of silver
 perseverent: any ideas
 perseverent:&#160;?
 kovi: but that way dbdr is not hungarian
 perseverent: BFS to first has no speed
 Doju: thethiny wow, what did you do?
 Doju: perseverent you need to make it not go to the first
 thethiny: @Doju I rewrote my code
 Doju: top tip
 perseverent: BFS to first 3 is slower than BFS to first 2 for some reason
 perseverent:&#160;:)
 dbdr: let's say together we count as one Peudoki :D
 thethiny: @Doju I also removed my combat mechanism
 Peudoki: okay dbdr :D
 Doju: thethiny that helped? :o
 dbdr: but feel free to switch if you want to overwhel the top completely :D
 eulerscheZahl: you are not hungarian?
 thethiny: yes
 eulerscheZahl: what you are dbdr?
 Doju: mmkay...
 perseverent: Yes Doju, but why BFS to first 3 is slower comapared to BFS to first 2?
 struct: french
 dbdr: I'm hungarian resident
 struct: he is french
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Peudoki: I'll fall out of top 10 fast though
 dbdr: EU citizen
 eulerscheZahl: he said he's not that fluent in french
 struct: not french?
 Doju: perseverent it shouldn't have much of a difference in computational speed
 Doju: if that's what you're talking about
 eulerscheZahl: but he seems to speak a lot of languages
 dbdr: I said that? I think there was someone complimenting on my french, might have been joking
 perseverent: Doju I mean performance in battles
 struct: So maybe he is from switzerland
 dbdr: it's my native language
 perseverent: if I submit this Doju I rank worst
 eulerscheZahl: oh. maybe your replied with sarcasm and i didn't get it
 Doju: perseverent what do you mean by "first 3"? neighbours? pellets? depth?
 EvModder: i just made a genius change
 perseverent: first 3 pellets
 EvModder: if my pacs are running away, they will prioritize running towards pellets, not arbitrary directions
 dbdr: oh, wow, it's 5 in top 10 now 
 dbdr: + Peudoki
 jrke: hey i have one error
 Doju: EvModder same but they also run into dead ends :p
 jrke: if i put if(n%3==1)
 jrke: then it works 
 jrke: and when if(n%6==1)
 jrke: it doesn't why
 dbdr: I hope my bot works out so I can join the top
 jrke: c++
 perseverent: Doju, my rank if I go after first 2 pallest, is higher than if I go after first one or the first 3
 Doju: umh.. sorry but i have no idea whats causing that perseverent
 Doju: use your perseverence to figure out
 perseverent: doju good point
 perseverent: not giving up
 perseverent: but close
 EvModder: Doju mine are doing that too, like in this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465191894">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465191894</a>
 EvModder: but hopefully i can fix that now
 Doju: But you won?
 Doju: and made no bad plays there?
 Doju: oh wait, frame 10
 Doju: gotcha
 Clagus: I found a new strategy! Go to sleep! Wake up! And you're in GOLD! :D
 perseverent: I tried that Clagus
 perseverent: not working
 Clagus: ok, you have to be top10 or top 5 first
 Clagus: did you try that?
 Clagus: :P
 perseverent: did you use BFS?
 EvModder: i'm going t just bit the bullet and submit
 EvModder: how bad could it be?
 EvModder: :D going mostly well so far
 ernestvw: guys please make the boss go down a bit
 BenWo: I don't get it, I'm timing out in a simple loop that I haven't changed in days
 EvModder: add lots and lots of debug code
 EvModder: i fixed a latent issue today that i'd had for days, it just wasn't triggered very commonly
 wlesavo: so eazy legend is when you take it by litterally sleeping
 EvModder: hahah yes wlesavo that's how i got in too xD
 BenWo: yep gonna keep adding more
 thethiny: rank 8 in Bronze finally
 [Csongor]: I get an error that it can't read id of undefined, but I logged the ids to console and both are defined. What is the problem here?
 llllllllll: hard to know, without seeing your code, so try to debug it
 thethiny: rank 4
 perseverent: what pathfinding are you using thethiny?
 thethiny: BFS
 perseverent: So do I thethiny, but I can not get it to outperform the boss
 perseverent: do you just look for closest 2 pellets thethiny?
 thethiny: no
 thethiny: I look for the closest 10 pellets
 perseverent: I tried for the first 3 pellets but than I ranked lower than if I just look for first 2 thethiny
 thethiny: sometimes when you look too far you miss the close ones
 thethiny: make sure you have a reward and penalty systems
 Doju: you look for that many pellets? :o
 thethiny: yeah I have to
 Doju: hm
 Doju: And go in the direction of their average pos?
 thethiny: How do I rank up if my battles are 100% done?
 perseverent: you mean like shortest path wins thethiny?
 thethiny: Now I have too many checks in place
 thethiny: see, I calculate all routes from here to 10 points away
 thethiny: then for each one I calculate the value
 thethiny: +1 for pellets, +10 for big, +0.5 for corners, -2 for enemies, -3 for players
 thethiny: then I calculate how many empty spaces are there, and where it starts
 perseverent: utility function
 thethiny: then I go to the point where the last space was found
 Doju: oh wow, you have a lot more complicated of a system than i do
 thethiny: I have to
 Clagus: @thethiny - other players are submitting and fighting with you from time to time
 thethiny: and I can't go more than that cuz python speed limitations
 Doju: What rank are you?
 perseverent: you can go up thethiny bc you fight others
 thethiny: @Clagus If it helps other people in their programming, then I don't mind
 thethiny: @preseverent I don't fight because it will waste time
 thethiny: I might do that later
 Clagus: thethiny sorry chat wasn't scrolled down :P I answered some old question I guess
 perseverent: thethiny I mean, your bot will fight even after the initial ranking was complet
 Doju: thethiny whatt how are you in bronze with such a sophisticated system=
 Doju: i thought you were in gold
 thethiny: oh @Clagus thanks! Sorry for the misunderstanding!
 Clagus: I'm in gold and still using A* implemented in game xD
 Clagus: is that an achievement? :P
 thethiny: @Doju cuz I just finished my code today
 Doju: okay gotcha
 perseverent: Clagus A* to what? where are you going?
 Clagus: perseverent - choosing a target I have a algorithm for that :P
 Doju: But anyways I've been thinking of doing something similar + a little extra to make a really magical system thethiny
 morning_cloud: In bronze level, are you finding a way to overcome the line of sight constraint?
 thethiny: guys the game sometimes is sending me that there's a Big Pellet even though there isn;t
 thethiny: @Doju best of luck
 Doju: i'm pretty sure you just have a bug thethiny
 perseverent: I see clagus,
 thethiny: @Doju I am printing the list of pellets and I can see the big pellet there
 thethiny: even though it's not on screen
 eulerscheZahl: do you clear the list?
 thethiny: yeah 
 Doju: o.o
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes the error streams looks off by 1 turn in the IDE
 thethiny: I will check and see
 jrke: hey some errors in IDE you are getting time out then replay again with same code then no timeouts:thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: happens when you are close to the time limit
 jrke: K
 Doju: or you hit some bugs that aren't triggered every time
 perseverent: morning_cloud no enemy tracking for me but I am in silver
 struct: or probably game doesnt play out the same
 yonder83: hello, I use A* too. 
 AntiSquid: nice, this submit is randomly better
 jrke: no if you click replay in same condition
 eulerscheZahl: soon legend AntiSquid?
 Doju: jrke is it deterministic?
 TinfoilSaint: Is A* the one where you assign weights to each direction and pick the best one?
 yonder83: I'm trying to get to gold League, my code needs a little optimization
 struct: jrke if you or your opponent has random  in his bot it probably wont play th same
 AntiSquid: doubt it, because i don't feel like rewriting to fix the bot
 jrke: K
 Peudoki: I'm 5th place but have attrocous winrate against top 4
 ernestvw: guys if you are top 2 of silver
 ernestvw: do you recommend to resubmit many times?
 ernestvw: or to wait to be pushed?
 Doju: no ernestvw
 Peudoki: is it close?
 ernestvw: it was 0.2
 Doju: i'd say just wait unless you have some major improvement in your code
 struct: was?
 ernestvw: now it is 0.4 i lost a match against a random perso
 Peudoki: wait to be pushed
 ernestvw: n
 ernestvw: ok! thx
 struct: Just wait like 1 hour
 ernestvw: i waited an hour already
 ernestvw: still 2nd
 ernestvw: i'll wait till i have a major improvement
 yonder83: @TinfoilSaint. In large map, there is so much paths that I cant calculate them all in game init. I continue calculation during each turn.
 ernestvw: i just remembered someone saying he got first after submitting 5 times
 ernestvw: that's why i aksed
 ernestvw: asked*
 struct: it can happen 
 struct: but can be risky
 struct: Sometimes it works
 jrke: after a pain of 4 hours full power coding first time in my life of 13 years i made Sim&#160;:)
 struct: On FB and STC I remember submiting like 30 times or soemthing to get to legnecd
 struct: legend*
 yonder83: very interesting challenge, by the way
 eulerscheZahl: the most honorable way to reach legend struct
 struct: on stc is forgivable
 ernestvw: if i'm not gold by 4pm i'll submit 30 times
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 yonder83: It's pleasant to compete with you, this is best entertainment for me :laughing:
 thethiny: @Maxlaxs our win rate is 1:1
 struct: ok, I dont have a real argument :p
 eulerscheZahl: illedan once complained about an overrated boss. gave him my bot. he was about 5 points above the boss at 60% and then cancelled the submit
 struct: Maybe it really isnt
 struct: yeah, that was what I was thinking
 struct: Most top 30 bots would destroy boss anyways
 wlesavo: euler what game it was? :slight_smile:
 Maxlaxs: @thethiny only played against you 2 times when I submitted, so I take your word for it lol
 AntiSquid: really curious what recurz is creating
 BoBot: hey, has there been a change in how much logging is allowed when running from IDE? I have had this problem throughout the contest, where I don't see why my code failed unless I comment out my logging - and it is not some ridiculous amount that would cause a timeout, like currently I commented out one line of log, and the execution moved on to the actual bug..
 BoBot: I am using Python, and I flush when I print to stderr
 llllllllll: im not aware of anything like that
 BoBot: asking here, because maybe it is reported/common knowledge
 thethiny: @Maxlaxs yeah XD
 togatoga: Does anyone know what compiler options we use? I found that there are some differences about the run time between my local and codingame env.
 EvModder: hey AntiSquid what'sup&#160;:)
 Doju: BoBot I had some timout issues when printing ridiculous amount of logs, i'd say you should be able to print out a fair few logs before timing out
 thethiny: #3 again lol
 thethiny: #2
 BoBot: @Doju yes, I have had those problems over old contests, one issue is not flushing and the other is logging too much - now there seems to be a third issue :D
 thethiny: YEAH BABY
 Doju: gratz thethiny
 llllllllll: grats
 thethiny: WHEN DO WE ADVANCE?
 EvModder: it should say at the top
 thethiny: NOOOOO
 Illedan: You have to finish submission
 thethiny: #2 again
 jrke: whats this timeout in one then win in another
 thethiny: but I beat inky
 thethiny: it's a win in my book
 AntiSquid: thanks i am fine EvModder
 EvModder: :D
 yonder83: @BoBot you can use timer keep track of remaining turn time. I use Stopwatch class for that
 AntiSquid: how's it going EvModder&#160;? where do you expect to be at the end of the contest?
 EvModder: i don't know really, it's actually going well
 thethiny: 85%
 thethiny: ü§ûüèªü§ûüèªü§ûüèªü§ûüèª
 EvModder: i lost some ranking but TBH that makes me less stressed about submitting new code now so im more motivated
 Maxlaxs: Ayy got pushed into silver lol
 thethiny: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
 AntiSquid: cool, but how will you get pushed into gold now
 BenWo: congrats thethiny&#160;:)
 thethiny: Thanks!
 Maxlaxs: @AntiSquid making pathfinding will prob help a lot lol
 AntiSquid: but then why didn't you do it prev league instead of waiting lol
 BoBot: @yonder83 thanks for that, there might be something surprising about where time is lost, though I am pretty sure it's not that
 Maxlaxs: Well I submittet it today so not that much waiting + was doing other things anyway
 thethiny: Clyde and I play the exact same way lol?
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465236812">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465236812</a>
 njaber: Maybe a previous iteration of your bot was selected to be Clyde?
 thethiny: Is that possible? Lol
 TinfoilSaint: wow, haven't seen a draw happen yet, what are the odds? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465238005">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465238005</a>
 Doju: I've seen it quite a few times TinfoilSaint
 njaber: I think they sometime choose a random submit that matches some criteria and power level as boss so this is possible
 thethiny: oh I see
 TinfoilSaint: Fair enough
 wlesavo: wait, chokudai actually joined
 BenWo: I am painfully slowly zeroing in on this bug
 wlesavo: 1st in gold rn
 Doju: wlesavo :o
 thethiny: I can easily beat Clyde, yet I struggle against the ladder üòÇüòÇ
 wlesavo: remember the chokudai search discussion? 
 Doju: Yup
 kovi: psyho was also active in the night
 thethiny: Guys what's Legend? A New league?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Doju: the highest league
 thethiny: oh wow
 BenWo: it's where the winners are
 thethiny: and what are the rules there?
 Doju: the same ones
 thethiny: then what's the difference
 AntiSquid: bronze league rules are supposed to be final thethiny
 Doju: see what BenWo said
 AntiSquid: same difference as silver and gold
 chokudai: I found this contest on twitter yesterday and entered it.
 thethiny: yeah but you can see dead pacs in silver
 AntiSquid: really? you're doing really well for a 1 day bot chokudai
 chokudai: thanks!
 AntiSquid: already legend .
 wlesavo: chokudai wow, nice
 solaimanope: congratulations on passing gold, chokudai
 chokudai: thanks!
 Doju: How do you make such a good bot in one day :o
 thethiny: experience
 thethiny: he has lots of it
 Doju: yeah
 Thiesjoo: How do you use BFS to get distance from every node to every node?
 thethiny: currently at #150 in silver so I feel good about myself
 Doju: Thiesjoo you run it from every node once and take note of the depth for each neighbour
 Thiesjoo: Ok thanks
 MattSOrme: before i went to bed last night i was around 100, then i submitted what i thought was an improvement, and woke up to 1300&#160;:/ 
 Doju: MattSOrme that sounds like a bug
 AntiSquid: i feel terrible even if i end up at #50 gold thethiny
 MattSOrme: haha, yeah, just a little
 thethiny: @AntiSquid the half of the glass
 BenWo: oh thank god I found it
 BenWo: now wtf did I do here
 Cappefra: I feel like it was harder for me to get into gold here than in ooc
 AntiSquid: really?
 wlesavo: legend is easier though, due to such randomness
 AntiSquid: here you're aren't forced to track opponents to get gold so that's a huge plus
 wlesavo: AntiSquid even legend actually
 Cappefra: Yeah AntiSquid, though it might be cause I lost a bunch of time trying to implement MCTS for the first time (and failed)
 <b>**AntiSquid removes tracking</b></p><p><img src="/a/43888825213429" /> AntiSquid: think the tracking rather confuses my bot
 MattSOrme: my bots run great till they start hitting my new pellet finding, then they seem to just start going back and forth&#160;:/ 
 Cappefra: I lost a bunch of stuff in my deterministic bot and had to rewrite it 
 EvModder: wlesavo your bot is non deterministic and i hate it lol
 EvModder: so hard to test anything against it xD
 Cappefra: but also it might only be that submitting here it's a bit frustrating cause of sooo much more randomness
 thethiny: *test
 wlesavo: EvModder at least it is not a boss this time :slight_smile:
 thethiny: how do you write in bold
 AntiSquid: EvModder imagine his bot was the gold boss (happened last contest, hard to test anything against)
 <b>**thethiny test</b></p><p><img src="/a/44367721008170" /> EvModder: o lord xD
 thethiny: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 Cappefra: I was beating the silver boss almost every time and I was in the first 50 places in silver, still I had to submit like 5 times before the algorithm even put me against the boss for the first time
 Cappefra: I was even place 9 at some point and didn't even get a single battle against the boss
 wlesavo: EvModder actually this one at least have fixed seed but a random number of simulations, ooc one had random seed
 Cappefra: then I went to the market, came back and now I'm mid-gold
 thethiny: well done
 Cappefra: it's weird hahaha
 EvModder: still outside my comfort zone lol
 njaber: has someone calculated the maximum distance between 2 points of the map in this contest?
 Scarfield: you could loop, go back and forth, how max dist?
 njaber: "Between 2 points"
 njaber: if you do BFS distance
 njaber: what's the max it can be
 wlesavo: if you do a bfs distance it is fixed
 njaber: You don't understand the question
 njaber: lemme rephrase it
 wlesavo: oh i see
 wlesavo: max val of distance
 Doju: the walls can be in different arrangements
 Doju: hmm
 njaber: If you were to search the shortest path between 2 points, what's the maximum length it can be
 BenWo: about 48 I think
 wlesavo: yeah, dont know about that but it is pretty close to Height+Width on most maps
 BenWo: could be a bit higher
 llllllllll: except if left-right side iis open
 BenWo: right, most will be half that
 BenWo: but there are maps without tunnels
 ntroPi: theoretically # free fields in board, if you don't make assumptions on the layout. Especially if path being blocked by enemy pacs is plausible
 BenWo: Just guesstimating, I'd say it wont exceed 65
 wlesavo: it will exceed basically on maps with dead ends of particular shape in the corners
 njaber: nvm, instead of hardcoding the value, I'll just calculate max length at the begining when doign my bfs, thx everyone fo the answers anyway
 njaber: I'm not counting pac blocking btw
 ntroPi: i.e. dijkstra should handle these cases well though.
 ntroPi: ah yes good idea to precalculate the exact number for the field in your case.
 njaber: I need it for optimization because I got an algo that runs in O(n^2) and same for memory where N is the number of turns, and Ireally want to optimize it, and I know I don't need turns past the max length I'm atalking about
 eulerscheZahl: are you using chokudai search?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, chat scrolled
 Scarfield: im still not sure what path you want, the longest non self intersecting path between 2 points? the longest path done with bfs where when the search reaches the target pos, it stops spreading?
 njaber: the longest possible "shortest path" between 2 points of a map
 njaber: so yeah last answer
 WINWINWIN: njaber, I asked this question on the forum earlier
 Scarfield: haha okay, makes sense
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/pathfinding-analysis/172154">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/pathfinding-analysis/172154</a>
 WINWINWIN: this is the answer
 njaber: WINWINWIN thx
 njaber: Oh it's not the same question
 Scarfield: this answers the longest path though
 njaber: Dw I got it working anyways
 WINWINWIN:  you want to find the longest potential path to a given location without crossing over your previously crossed points.
 njaber: WINWINWIN no it's just the longest a "flood" algorithm could need to run to fill the whole map
 njaber: I don't need it for a flood but since I do flood on all cells at the beginning of the game I alreeady got my answer
 njaber: I just hope it's not more then 100 or else I might have cases where I can timeout
 njaber: hope it cannot be *
 WINWINWIN: K, sorry no forum post on it
 elderlybeginner: anyone knows how to get rid of editor suggestions and tips?
 Scarfield: since it is a "direct" path it shouldnt exceed 35 + 17, at least not when you are using bfs to find it. the spreading will cancel out longer paths, i suppose anyway
 njaber: Scarfield I think it can be a little more then that if there are convoluted wlls can't it?
 njaber: walls*
 Scarfield: there is propably some cases where it can reach a little more, but certainly not up to 100, the expanding of the bfs will stop that i think
 njaber: I mean without the constraints of the tetris map generation algorithm, the longest would be a spiral, but a map like that can't happen with this algo
 JohnCM: haha i think heuristics alone can't go to legend already
 JohnCM: need to use some form of partial simulation
 MSmits: you sure do
 JohnCM: while i can win the ai 70% of the time, i can't win the rest
 JohnCM: when i configure to win the rest, i can't win the ai
 Scarfield: anyway gtg, happy coding all&#160;:)
 JohnCM: so it is a dilemma here
 WINWINWIN: Are all the people in legend using opponent tracking or is map tracking enough?
 JohnCM: yup which heuristics can't solve because it doesn't adapt very well to diff. playstyles
 MSmits: you can get legend with opponent tracking if you assume opponent to be stationary and dont get near opponents that kill your pac
 MSmits: without opponent tracking i mean
 MSmits: so just worry about coordinating your own pacs
 Peudoki: own pac coordinating is so much more important than anything else
 MSmits: yes, it's really the only thing in my bot I can definitively say helps a lot
 eulerscheZahl: bu tracking really helps to know where to harvest
 MSmits: the rest is just, meh...
 BenWo: oh thank god it didn't crash
 JohnCM: i get what you mean MSmits
 MSmits: yes its helpful, *if* you can pull it off euler. It's not easy and not many succeed i think
 eulerscheZahl: mine isn't perfect either
 eulerscheZahl: still better than nothing
 JohnCM: i use a similar approach, but i don't search everything, I estimates lots of it with heuristics
 MSmits: dont think anyone's is perfect
 ntroPi: elderlybeginner you can disable applying of the editor suggestion on return key - in settings
 MSmits: better than nothing is a serious achievement
 JohnCM: i only need to run bfs for my algo and that's it, pretty good alr
 NormantasStankevicius: Gold, legends of this contest, when you are looking where to go next, do you look for all the possible pellets and how much you will make on the quickest way there? or just see if going North, East, South West is more worth by doing a recursive way of finding the most valuable path going the 4 directions?
 JohnCM: nearest pellet isn't going to cut it
 MSmits: people do this differently NormantasStankevicius. I try random move combinations for my pacs and pick the best ones
 JohnCM: you need to have a sum of future rewards
 MSmits: yes
 JohnCM: either by simulation or by bfs
 NormantasStankevicius: well I don't go nearest pellet
 NormantasStankevicius: I go through a vector
 WINWINWIN: With a variable number or pacs is it possible to write a simulation? the definition of a solution will keep changing?
 NormantasStankevicius: and retrace the fastest way from my pac to the pellet
 NormantasStankevicius: and do value / distance
 Ramzel: I m not even checking if place when i go has pelet
 NormantasStankevicius: so on the way I might pick up 5 pellets
 JohnCM: you can ask MSmits for his Smitsmax (individual minimax style tree for each pac)
 MSmits: dont do that for this contest please
 MSmits: it's not going to work
 JohnCM: still surprised it actually works for coder strike back. since it ultimately is an approx.
 MSmits: it works for csb yes and some others
 MSmits: but it is very important that the agents possible actions may be only weakly affected by opponent actions
 MSmits: see kutulu, where you can only block someone with yell
 GreatTux: I get all the paths &lt; dist X then score them and take the best, the distance from the current pac is a parameter of the score, you don't always want to reach the closest pellet
 JohnCM: this one is quite strongly affected by opp actions
 MSmits: yes, so no smitsi
 JohnCM: so the opp tracking can be important
 JohnCM: or a way to figure out which "areas to harvest"
 MSmits: i dont doubt that it's important. It's just hard to do
 JohnCM: haha i do a partial opp tracking, but it wasn't good enough
 MSmits: same
 Peudoki: same
 eulerscheZahl: Peudoki you are 7th without?!
 GreatTux: opp tracking can give you an edge but it's a massive time investement and potentially small reward
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't expect that
 MSmits: well i am debugging a new way now... if you somehow see me in top 20 it worked :P
 WINWINWIN: how much time does your tracking part take eulerscheZahl?
 MSmits: it doesn't have to take time though WINWINWIN. You can do it heuristically with many assumptions. Then the calc time is negligible
 eulerscheZahl: really hard to answer, depends on the turn
 eulerscheZahl: i would say 10ms at most.
 eulerscheZahl: except for some rare edge cases when it can even make me timeout :D
 Peudoki: I have something eulerschZahl
 WINWINWIN: But would it be sufficiently accurate?
 JohnCM: heuristics, i love them
 eulerscheZahl: but i have a cost heuristic. when tracking is too expensive, i skip it
 Peudoki: it just didn't improve my standing much when I added it
 JohnCM: when you use python and can't do monte carlo, heuristics are the way to go
 Peudoki: probaby it is better than nothing
 JohnCM: haha i should go learn C++ more so I can use it for the next comp
 eulerscheZahl: python was your free choice&#160;;)
 JohnCM: was lazy to convert
 JohnCM: i tried to use monte carlo, it couldn't do much
 eulerscheZahl: some players learned C++ just for codingame
 eulerscheZahl: such as MSmits
 JohnCM: so heuristics all the way
 JohnCM: but euler you use C#
 JohnCM: seems to work quite well also
 eulerscheZahl: correct. because my C++ knowledge is poor
 eulerscheZahl: i can code it but not as fast as C#
 WINWINWIN: Is C# slower that C++?
 eulerscheZahl: by factor 2 i would say
 MSmits: yep... I am pretty sure eulerscheZahl can do c++ better than I can. But I specialized in this little CG-niche. I can do C++ fairly well just on CG. I never even made a multi-file project though
 NormantasStankevicius: maaaan, I hate the idea, that it reads  pacs that are dead in the function that reads all the pacs I have and enemy visable pacs, that created a lot of bugs for me
 JohnCM: hey yep i gtg, cya around
 Peudoki: what language specific knowledge do you guys use?
 MSmits: WINWINWIN, it depends on the game, but C++ can be much faster sometimes than just a factor of 2. It depends on what the game is
 dbf: Peudoki, in mostly memory management is important - how objects are created/reused how not to be affected by gc (if aavailable in language)
 NormantasStankevicius: ^^^^
 Numby: Is there any way to reset/look up the starter code for a language?
 NormantasStankevicius: my teacher is good at C++, I'm good at C#, but for example he stated the issues how a function may run faster if your inserted parameters are smaller in C++
 NormantasStankevicius: also not sure if other languages do that, but in C#, always place the first if statement (if you are using multiple checks) the ones that if you do not check, might brake your code (out of range for arrays) or the ones that would quickly eliminate the function, but those don't add much
 MSmits: you have to be careful about not inserting big objects because it will copy them. Or you need to pass a pointer
 MSmits: C# automatically uses references for objects
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah
 NormantasStankevicius: MSmits, so I normally could outperform C++ when it comes to big objects
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: because c++ can also just pass a reference
 HiIamFriend: c++ lol
 MSmits: but you need to think about these things
 MSmits: in C# you dont as much
 MSmits: thats why coding happens faster in C#
 MSmits: I think there are very very few instances where C# will ever be faster than C++ at anything when it comes to performance
 MSmits: but the virtual machine may do some optimization during use
 MSmits: and sometimes this is significant as I understand
 HiIamFriend: MSits in lithuania 90% of teachers only knows c++ dont judge him
 MSmits: i won't judge anyone. Pretty sure these teachers know more about it than I do anyway
 HiIamFriend: no
 HiIamFriend: u are wrong :D
 HiIamFriend: most of them only knows basic stuff
 MSmits: I know a little piece of it really well and have no broad knowledge
 MSmits: this is especially true for c++, but also somewhat for C#. I know a bit more, but not a third of what euler does I think
 HiIamFriend: its kind a useless to know c++ at these times
 MSmits: depends on what your line of work is going to be
 MSmits: i noticed that working with C++ for a while gives you intimate knowledge about how memory works
 MSmits: this helps you when using other languages, like C#
 MSmits: especially when you're trying to avoid cache misses and such
 wlesavo: JohnCM but you can do MC with python, not a lot of estimations, but quite enough i would say
 elderlybeginner: @ntroPi tried: {"editor.parameterHints.enabled": false} and it's not working
 ntroPi: no idea, how to disable them completely. But they don't annoy me without the permanent auto apply on return. Did you find that setting?
 eulerscheZahl: "Accept suggestion on Enter key"
 eulerscheZahl: settings, above the keybindings
 elderlybeginner: yes, I did, "accept..." off has nothing to do with it, i'm changing keybindings in accordance to some tips from vscode
 thethiny: going over the comments in my code
 thethiny: "Temp section, remove later". Little did I know, this temp section is what made everything work.
 BenWo: rofl
 njaber: Someone who does C# , is there a way to extract a part of a bitArray into a smaller bitArray, or do operations between BitArrays of different sizes?
 llllllllll: seen this comment in production code @thetiny
 llllllllll: then someone added a comment to the next line: "temporary my ass"
 NormantasStankevicius: fixed a bug when accounting for dead pacs, now 150~ silver&#160;:) I am happy
 llllllllll: grats!
 thethiny: @llllllllll  üòÇüòÇ
 thethiny: cibgrats Norman!
 thethiny: congrats*
 MSmits: well done
 wygryw83: Is anyone from Poland?
 llllllllll: *types "import random"*things will get crazy now
 MSmits: sure people live there
 MSmits: population &gt; 0

 MSmits: thats on general leaderboard, but many of those will not be active
 NormantasStankevicius: Poland has some really competitive universities, @wygryw83, and during the last competition they were really good as much as I remember
 lifetimeLearner007: Hi. Given a source, I want to find a path with most pellets. Currently I'm using dfs for this. Now, my question is, is this correct approach or should I use bfs?
 Doju: Path to what?
 thethiny: Use what you feel is better for you
 thethiny: BFS is used to find the paths to something else, DFS will go into each branch and go inside it.
 lifetimeLearner007: there is no destination Doju, just need to find a path that has most pellets. I'm not sure if dfs is more suitable or bfs is. Does that make a difference w.r.t. efficiency?
 Doju: lifetimeLearner007 so you're finding the shortest path that goes through every pellet on the map?
 lifetimeLearner007: yeah, shortest or longest, I don't mind as long as there are most pellets in it
 Doju: Ohhh
 Doju: you're finding the path that contains the most pellet and doesn't go through the same cell twice?
 Doju: most pellets*
 lifetimeLearner007: yes
 lifetimeLearner007: Is this approach even correct? Do I need to take up different approach?
 Doju: The approach that you take is up to you
 Doju: but i think your problem is a variation of the travelling salesman problem
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Special_cases">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Special_cases</a>
 Doju: Perhaps this one? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_travelling_salesman_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_travelling_salesman_problem</a>
 lifetimeLearner007: tsp ensures all nodes are visited and reach back to source.
 Doju: well maybe it's not that then
 lifetimeLearner007: here, all floor cells may or maynot have pellets. just want to maximize the path with most pellets.
 thethiny: I accidentally submitted and I went wayyyyyyyyy behind
 thethiny: and I can't even remember what I changed
 randymarsh: Under history on the left panel you should see the submitted versions
 thethiny: oh nice
 thethiny: I forgot about this
 thethiny: thanks
 randymarsh: :thumbsup:
 elderlybeginner: puzzle executions time limit is constant or it depends on a puzzle?
 struct: depends on puzzle
 struct: and language
 Cappefra: oh I didn't know it depended on the language
 elderlybeginner: how to find time limit for a puzzle if it's not mentioned in the description?
 elderlybeginner: beside in-code try-error checking 
 struct: yes, it is not mentioned, I guess the only way is by measuring it yourself
 struct: like make 1 sec timer or something and check if timeout
 struct: if yes it must be lower
 struct: else higher
 SabertheLost: anyone know, if you do array[x] in typescript, can you modify the class inside the array from outside? 
 njaber: If I copy part of a code that is under MIT licencing in my bot (I want to modify the BitArray class from the c# source code, but the class is sealed) will the be a problem with licensing? is adding the license as a comment just above the class enough?
 Rimailleur: hello, is there a big concern of time out on the current challenge&#160;?
 llllllllll: depends on what you want to implement
 Rimailleur: no, i mean in the game itself
 Rimailleur: i see timeout in battle for my submitted code
 Rimailleur: but they do happen in IDE&#160;!
 Rimailleur: but they doN,T happen in IDE&#160;!
 MattSOrme: If you have a timeout, its your code
 Rimailleur: i have no timeout in IDE with the same battle
 Quidome: maybe it is not the same batlle
 MattSOrme: could be randomness in your or enemy bot making the game run different?
 Quidome: due to randomness
 Quidome:&#160;:)
 Cappefra: it means there's some randomness in either yours on your enemy's moves
 Kukiss: if the time is at the edge of limit it may also be random if you get time out or not
 Cappefra: or you're pushing it really close to 50 ms 
 MattSOrme: yeah, if you're maxing out your time, maybe cap at ~48ms 
 Rimailleur: i thought it was due to random in the opposent code
 Rimailleur: the forum seems to contain many cases like mine, but i did not see a codingame comment
 Rimailleur: Well thanks, boring challenge for me&#160;! 
 wlesavo: ooc sized legend in a first day
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is weak
 eulerscheZahl: and the game has enough randomness for a lucky push
 MattSOrme: you and mazelcop are getting bounced around each other as others challenge you
 tuning: hi
 tuning: hello
 Doju: hello hello
 IAmNoob: hi
 SabertheLost: Two hours trying to figure out why my function was not updating the values, only to find out that I ended by resetting all values in the  loop
 MattSOrme: I've made so many dumb mistakes trying to code this thing.
 IAmNoob: i too:)
 [Csongor]: yeah, but learned a lot from the mistakes
 IAmNoob: how to make level exept the puzzles?
 IAmNoob: cause i made lots of puzzles and only level 22
 tuning: no
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 SabertheLost: My attempts to make small improvmes just makes me drop in rank&#160;:)
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)_)
 MattSOrme: Last night i pushed an "improvement" and dropped about 700 places
 SabertheLost: Like, changing to move towards a pacman with that i can eat. Lost 300 ranks.
 MattSOrme: SabertheLost, probably need to cover conditions like if they can switch then don't attack
 SabertheLost: If they have swiched thay are not valid target next step
 SabertheLost: hmm, you can see if they can swich&#160;?&#160;:) 
 MattSOrme: ability_cooldown == 0
 Lord_Pixel: +-
 user938300: can i disable all peeks and highlighting? the red squiggle blinds me
 user938300: or anything to be done about the red underline? it is like coding in a word processor
 MattSOrme: ugh. Im having to add a silly amount of lines just to catch a stupidly small scenario
 IAmNoob: any idea about level
 IAmNoob: i asked above
 IAmNoob: and i have 90% of the resinens
 IAmNoob: can someone help me?
 [Csongor]: Do anything on this site and your coding skills will level up.
 JohnCM: hey i'm learning C++ now
 JohnCM: can you have multiple files at the same time in codingame?
 JohnCM: like #include "myfile.h"
 MattSOrme: Bit late for this competition JohnCM&#160;;)
 MattSOrme: Whens the next comp? Might have to learn for that one
 MattSOrme: Is rust good, or is dbdr just a freak with it?
 JohnCM: nah not for this comp haha, i'm sort of done coding already
 JohnCM: the rest is up to the competition to see my final rank
 IAmNoob: you have to work now too
 MattSOrme: My aim is just to get to gold, then i'll be happy
 MattSOrme: top 100 in silver atm
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465389772">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465389772</a>
 IAmNoob: gg
 IAmNoob: the terranin is symetric sooo....:)
 MSmits: look at what it's doing at the end
 SabertheLost: Finaly, it moving upwards again. 
 JohnCM: haha it is common for my program too to draw
 JohnCM: in fact for most deterministic programs it should draw
 JohnCM: just... for simulations wise, may not be easy to draw
 MSmits: I monte carlo though :P
 JohnCM: it means that there is no better move
 JohnCM: you have reached nash equilibrium
 MSmits: yeah, if i do this  a couple times, i get maybe 3 different games
 JohnCM: means you should submit 3 different times also
 JohnCM: each submit might be a different leaderboard placing
 MSmits: my submits dont get high, they drift up over time
 IAmNoob: @johnCM not really
 IAmNoob: it is a chance but you can submit 100 times and still dont change the place
 JohnCM: haha why not. since gameplay is sort of random rollouts, you may have diff. rollouts
 SabertheLost: soo, after 4 hous of coding, when from 560 to 460 in broze...
 IAmNoob: it worth 
 IAmNoob: 
 MSmits: the leaderboard is very random. If you're testing bot improvements with submits, you wont get any reliable measurements. Except on the really big improvements
 MSmits: havent had those very often
 SabertheLost: Well, it was down at 900 ealier today)
 MSmits: When I was in gold, the same version that once ended at 170 on a submit, also was in legend less than an hour after it opened
 MSmits: which is almost the same version that is now ranked around 20
 MSmits: thats how random it is
 MattSOrme: I just check my game history for a bug, then work on that till its working. But half the time, fixing one bug is causing 2 more haha
 MSmits: yeah... i gets bet
 MSmits: bad
 MSmits: i have 2300 lines now
 SabertheLost: oooo, it¬¥s climbing, now at 160
 MSmits: I doubt it's bugfree
 MattSOrme: wishing mine would randomy jump up a league&#160;;)
 SabertheLost: All bugs are features
 SabertheLost: is it feature free +
 SabertheLost:&#160;?
 IAmNoob: when comes the last leauge?\
 Hjax: yesterday 
 MSmits: its out
 IAmNoob: ok:(
 IAmNoob: i am still silver
 IAmNoob: so.....
 MSmits: one advantage of a fairly random bot is that you can more reliably test improvements vs yourself
 MSmits: your opponent will be a bit different 
 SabertheLost: ok, my broze elo when from 21 to 27...
 MSmits: in different games
 [Csongor]: IAmNoob the leaderboard shows you in bronze.
 IAmNoob: bruh
 IAmNoob: dude is anyone here python developer?
 IAmNoob:&#160;?????
 IAmNoob: no okk...
 IAmNoob: bye i have to go:(
 SabertheLost: Maybe i should use the fact that I can around the map if there is no wall&#160;:)
 MSmits: SabertheLost write a neighbor function that finds all the neighbors and do two ifs (if x == 0 and if x == width -1)
 MSmits: that way it is easily added
 MSmits: it's not one of the hard things about this multi
 MSmits: err contest
 eulerscheZahl: my bot supports wrapping at the top/bottom too
 eulerscheZahl: 2 completely useless lines in my bot
 MSmits: hah yes, i started coding this for "y" and stopped
 eulerscheZahl: codejam in 9min
 MSmits: you're going to participate&#160;!?
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 MSmits: you have a chance at nr 1 in this contest 
 MSmits: take it&#160;:)
 MSmits: I want to see you at nr 1
 eulerscheZahl: unrealistic&#160;:(
 MSmits: if you dont have any new ideas, then yes
 MSmits: otherwise no
 eulerscheZahl: i need a major rework of my broken pathfinding
 MSmits: I see
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't even have ideas how to code it
 MSmits: well anyways, this is an awesome result already, especially for a 5K contest
 MSmits: some good players 
 kovi: amd who knows what brings the final recalc
 eulerscheZahl: i will try some more tomorrow
 SabertheLost: yea, it was super easy&#160;:) 
 MSmits: yeah kovi, i saw you right above me 1 time on the leaderboard
 MSmits: even though your bot is much stronger
 eulerscheZahl: there will be some last-minute submits i guess
 MattSOrme: Im ahead of my friends/co-workers who are doing this, so im happy :D
 MSmits: thats the best metric MattSOrme
 MSmits: compare with people you know
 H1ggsb0s0n: use it when asking for the raise :D
 MSmits: unless they're too good, then just get to know some worse players
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know any participants in person&#160;:(
 MSmits: I know you better than most of my colleagues lol
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MattSOrme: I've been waiting for this comp, so i got some other people keen to have a go before it started. Though i don't think they've spent as long on it as i have
 ShannonNorris97: I don't have anyone from my rl competing either. I might try to convince people next time; even though I'm having a lot of fun competing, it would be way more fun to compete against people I knew as well
 ashikujjaman: though I have enabled speed boast to my pac but it's going one step while opponent pac is going two step . what's the problem here?see this from 16 move<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465403959">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465403959</a>my team is red
 MattSOrme: You need to set target more than 1 step away
 cguzman: Anyone can explain me why I lose here? 
 cguzman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465410454">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465410454</a>
 MattSOrme: You timed out
 MattSOrme: Send game to your ide, and re-play it to debug
 MattSOrme: Look like your bottom right pac gets confused
 cguzman: Yes, it is not clear for him whether to kill the enemy or get the high pellet :joy:
 cguzman: Got it, I have a nullpointerexception .. puff
 MattSOrme: I currently have the word "pac" in my code just shy 500 times...
 dbdr: first commit in more than 2 days&#160;:)
 wlesavo: dbdr big changes? 
 dbdr: no, actually it's a small tweak, one more feature
 dbdr: how are you doing wlesavo?
 MattSOrme: ugh, finally, dealt with pacs going for tens that will get them killed
 wlesavo: dbdr hit legend while sleeping, dont think ill improve much anymore
 elderlybeginner: how to check memory usage of puzzle code in python?
 wlesavo: implemented most of thing i had in mind, and my motivation is kind of low now, cant say i really liked the game 
 ashikujjaman: how can I see the wood league?I am now in silver league
 semera: Working on simuator and I don't underestand <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465376255">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465376255</a>, turn 20. Two red pacs do MOVE 1 33 9|MOVE 4 34 9.First are bumped, it's fine. But Pac 4 has speed, so then he should move to 33 9?? in rules is "Repeat for any pac with an activated SPEED ability." How is evaluation?
 wlesavo: elderlybeginner do you think you can hit the memory limit?
 dbdr: you don't get OOC vibes wlesavo? hidden information as wel...
 elderlybeginner: wlesavo, no just for test tuples and lists
 dbdr: MSmits you're in top 20&#160;:)
 dbdr: do that mean your feature worked?
 wlesavo: dbdr i do, but most of thing i tried made my bot worse, and  thats quite discouraging, at some point i wanted to give up on legend even
 MSmits: no, I havent submitted it yet
 MSmits: should be a small improvement
 wlesavo: elderlybeginner oh, i just use tuples whenever possible
 MSmits: but when i submit I wont end at 16
 MSmits: i will end at 30 and drift up over time
 MSmits: my CG bench test gave 57-43 vs my old version
 MattSOrme: Is there some tool you're using to test against the same bot many times, or just counting yourself?
 MSmits: i do cg benchmark
 Nerchio: is it hard to set up smits?
 Nerchio: probably not
 wlesavo: still impressed by choku dai hitting top 10 in one day
 Nerchio: seeing some stats could help me with my motivation :p
 wlesavo: it is even less than a day actually
 dbdr: you know whe he started?
 wlesavo: dbdr he said on a chat today, that found the contest on twitter yeasterday and decided to join
 dbdr: oh, nice!
 WINWINWIN: Top 12 in 1 day??? I am not even top 1000 in 8 days!
 wlesavo: Nerchio it is quite easy actually, takes like couple of minutes to change configuration, collecting is long though
 Nerchio: still good though :p
 Nerchio: you use it?
 jdyerjdyer: Is there a way to leave the contest. I signed up a while back thinking I'd have time, but then I got some work that has overlapped this week leaving me no time. It seems like this keeps happening.&#160;:(
 Nerchio: so just leave your bot
 Nerchio: why do you need to 'exit' so to speak
 WINWINWIN: When a collision occurs, on the next turn is you location equal to your previous location?
 MSmits: yes Nerchio it is pretty easy
 MSmits: but I cant use it by saving a file from my IDE and then starting CG bench
 MSmits: text encoding issue
 MSmits: so i made a new text file i copy my code into
 njaber: WINWINWIN yes unless your pac used speed and he collided only on the second frame
 WINWINWIN: Ok, thanks njaber
 wlesavo: Nerchio i do also just read the readme its quite easy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark</a>
 Nerchio: yeah i looked it over thats why i said looks quite easy
 wlesavo: oh, i see
 Nerchio: i will set it up for next contest im not feeling the pac anymore :D
 wlesavo: MSmits new version submit? :slight_smile:
 MSmits: yeah... impossible to know if it's any good
 MSmits: my last submit was at 16, but on the end of the submit it was at 37 or so
 MSmits: so i cant know if it is better until half a day later or something
 MSmits: it is better in cg bench though
 AntiSquid: very frustrating 
 jdyerjdyer: Oh, well. Guess it doesn't matter much. Just wish I could have at least submitted something. This one looked like a lot of fun. Maybe I'll just come back to it when it is a regular game. If things will quit interrupting my fun time...
 MSmits: yeah, I suppose. The idea is to  be significantly better than anyone else though, if you can't do that, it's your own fault :P
 MSmits: so i take the blame here
 struct: jdyerjdyer there is guy at top 15 that started yesterday
 AntiSquid: your own fault the system is broken heh
 MSmits: it's not broken really. this is not because the ranking is bad
 MSmits: the game just has a strong random/luck component
 jdyerjdyer: Yeah, but I have to work through this weekend.&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: it is bad
 MSmits: even if it were perfect, you'd see the same result
 jdyerjdyer: Supposed to be working now.
 MSmits: it's not the ranking, it's the game
 MSmits: in other games it's really reliable
 MSmits: for example, csb
 AntiSquid: i always see a different result though
 MSmits: because of the game
 AntiSquid: csb was also random :D still is
 dbdr: I'm not sure, I still see the top bots doing bad moves
 dbdr: including mine obviously
 MSmits: i'm always at 6 or 7 AntiSquid
 MSmits: never changes
 struct: csb is random if the bots are the same
 struct: otherwise not
 AntiSquid: if there's a huge difference to the bots below yes it works
 MSmits: thats the thing, this game cant have a huge difference at the top
 AntiSquid: but if the difference isn't huge enough then it doesn't work
 MSmits: the random component is stronger than the differences between the bots
 AntiSquid: a good leaderboard doesn't only sort well the obvious cases
 AntiSquid: like putting at the top the bot that is better by a large margin, you can do that by hand lol
 kovi: once again, it is hard to climb with near 50% winrates vs. many others
 MSmits: it's impossible to solve the problem of rock paper scissors between players
 MSmits: the player who submits, will always screw up the leaderboard
 MSmits: pushing those stronger to him or her and pulling on those weaker
 MSmits: the only thing you can do to prevent it is to be significantly better than others
 dbdr: there are systems where matches are played automatically
 dbdr: not especially when you submit
 MSmits: that would be better, but also problematic
 MSmits: too many would have to be played
 dbdr: why?
 MattSOrme: time to see if this change makes me go up or down haha
 struct: I dont think cg would want that
 MSmits: people who just submit once and then ignore the contest for 3 days, would cause a lot more stress on the servers if there were automatic battles
 struct: The cost being the first problem i think
 dbdr: you can play matches less often in lower leagues
 MSmits: true, that would be better
 MSmits: this is why they only recalc the top
 dbdr: most players are in bronze or below
 MSmits: right
 MattSOrme: How do they calc the final winner? Is it just who happens to be at the top when time is called, or do they have a system?
 MattSOrme: Like get the top 100, and have them all play each other, then repeat for 50, 20, 10, 5
 MSmits: lots of games played at the end MattSOrme
 MSmits: automatic
 MSmits: with smaller jumps in rating
 MSmits: but it starts with the current leaderboard yes
 MSmits: I fear this contest may not have a clear winner, even though the winner will be one of the best bots
 struct: just like previous one
 MSmits: pb 4 showed he won by a different system also
 MSmits: but not by a huge margin no
 MSmits: what i mean is that this time the winner might actually win due to luck, compared to the nr 2. I hope not, but it could be true
 ashikujjaman: how can I see the wood league?
 Ikhadem: is there a reason why my code times out sometimes in ranking phase but when i send that to IDE it doesn't?
 struct: ashikujjaman select league on filters

 struct: Ikhadem maybe on bot has random on it?
 struct: and doesnt play same moves
 Ikhadem: nope i have no random values
 struct: But your opponent
 struct: might have
 Ikhadem: k
 ashikujjaman: struct, I want to code for wood league for better developing my bot
 King-Of-Code: yeah id get to the higher ranks first then create a better structure because the rules change
 MattSOrme: Does coding with all the info help?Just because you can make better decisions with all the data, doesn't mean that will help when you take it all away
 wlesavo: euler posted a contribution page for spring challenge, but i dont have the link

 struct: change league at  the top
 WINWINWIN: How do you send game parameters to ide in a replay?
 WINWINWIN: Got it, sorry
 ShannonNorris97: How do you guys decide when to use speed?
 wereii: if enemy_near: sanic_mode()
 dbdr: don't panic!
 wereii: imma not in speedable league, yet :P 
 MattSOrme: damn, my improvements made me slightly worse again&#160;:(
 wereii: oh lol, my code (for one pac) from wood 2 just won over the boss by 8 points xd 
 wereii: in wood 1
 MSmits: yep thats how it goes
 ChooJeremy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465474605">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465474605</a> Interesting seed where 2 of your pacs start stuck in a corner
 ChooJeremy: Especially interesting to me cause the gold boss times out on this seed
 [Csongor]: It was a wrong decision not implementing pathfinding, but I  never really programmed one before. Now I have to suffer. ):
 Stanworld: hi , where i can find the referee&#160;? 
 Stanworld: i found... 
 uvBoss: hello?
 uvBoss: can anyone tel me how to work with multiple files in js??
 uvBoss: tell*
 PiterYeh: uvBoss you have to setup your own bundler, because CG accepts a single source file
 uvBoss: yeah how do i merge them??
 uvBoss: there are no plugins..i searched and could not find
 [Csongor]: copy, paste
 uvBoss: dat is tedious man
 struct: Im sure that if you google it you can find an answer
 uvBoss: how many times do u do that for running once??
 struct: "merge multiple files javascript"
 uvBoss: i tried .. could not find something 
 uvBoss: or i dint understand
 HungryBurger: uvBoss -- I have the same challenge with Python. I use bash to merge all my files together. Once I built a basic bundler script, I've been using it for all the contests.
 uvBoss: i dont how to do that
 uvBoss: XD nooooooob
 HungryBurger: Well, on the bright side, you're writing advanced enough code now, that you need to learn how to get your computer to help manage it for you.
 uvBoss: my head hurts lookin at this one file
 uvBoss: k im gonna make a simple text merger then..
 HungryBurger: :thumbsup:
 Doju: This is getting complicated&#160;:|
 Doju: Now i have to give the cells two different levels of "wall"
 Kellthazar: My enemy enconter resolver was so complicated... I deleted it all and wrote from the beggining, a lot more readable.
 Doju: Actually I think it's not _that_ complicated after all
 Doju: luckily i made my earlier code pretty flexible
 Doju: Cuz what my pacs are doing atm, just freezing if they are next to an enemy pac, is unacceptable
 Kellthazar: You not eval if they can  kill you?
 Doju: eval?
 Doju: oh
 Doju: i do
 Kellthazar: Sorry for my english XD
 Doju: if they can kill me, i set the cells next to them as walls
 Doju: and if my bfs starts from a wall it returns none
 Doju: luckily i can change that :p
 MattSOrme: ugh, now my 10 targetting is broke again. So frustrating
 WINWINWIN: perseverent -- latest guy in gold
 muy31: for real, i just helped him 2 days ago
 muy31: when he was in bronze
 MattSOrme: probably shouldn't have&#160;;)
 Doju: woow
 Kellthazar: One thing I did, was just use the pellets to check if a floor (or cell) was explored or not...
 VicHofs: meanwhile I'm still here lol
 Doju: Kellthazar isn't that a bit obvious? xd
 Doju: Oh you mean like
 Doju: if a pellet is gone and you haven't eaten it, the ones next to it might be gone too?
 Kellthazar: I dont go for pellets, but paths that will discover more unexplored areas...
 Doju: hm
 Kellthazar: Soh, at the moment, Im trying to do this more coopeartive-like
 Kellthazar: given weights for cells based on the ammount of pacs nearby
 Kellthazar: nearny unexplored cells
 Kellthazar: etc...
 prost: i just got started here any advice?
 Doju: prost you still have enough time to participate in the spring challenge
 prost: whats that again
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 Doju: that's basically what we're all talking about
 AntiSquid: JohnCM what have you done? you were like top 5, thought you were going to legend at some point
 Beerus: are starting positions always symmetric?
 Doju: Yes Beerus
 Beerus: damn i just noticed
 Beerus: if i use that can i go legend from gold
 fchris82: I always get the same ID for the pacmans.
 fchris82: I'm alone with this issue?
 Doju: fchris82 your pacs and enemy pacs get the same ids
 seronis: each of your pacmen have a unique id
 muy31: for every pacman?
 seronis: ie:  the first 3 pacmen on each team will get 0 through 2
 seronis: you -never- have the same id used more than once on a single team
 seronis: if you think they are,  you're reading data wrong
 fchris82: Doju Thanks, I thought this is a bug and I should get different ID for the enemy pacman
 Doju: i'm doing waaay too many loops over the entire grid
 Doju: if i need to clear anything i just loop over every cell instead of taking the to-be-cleared- things out specifically
 Doju: Nice, looks like Clyde is deterministic
 Doju: makes debugging a loot easier
 JohnCM: haha i didn't do anything, the rest just caught up
 AntiSquid: so unlucky then
 JohnCM: anyway my bot is effective against the top 10, but not so good for the top 100. so it is a fine balance
 JohnCM: no worries
 JohnCM: i'm like 50% through with C++, will do better for sim based competitions next time
 JohnCM: python just can't do monte carlo
 JohnCM: just studied C++ for about 4 hours today. pretty easy for me to pick up as I know Python and C and a bit of Java
 JohnCM: pretty similar
 AntiSquid: true
 JohnCM: how about you antisquid
 JohnCM: any hopes of going legend?
 kovi: euler winning while away to play codejam
 AntiSquid: i just fix some minor bugs, but ladder is to random for me to try a submit, so i will wait and see if i can do a massive improvement, don't want to restart my bot, i know why the current structure is a complete failure
 eulerscheZahl: i failed codejam horribly
 eulerscheZahl: just came back
 eulerscheZahl: rank 2677
 eulerscheZahl: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 AntiSquid: what's your usual rank&#160;?
 JohnCM: probably euler will win this comp. i'm betting on it
 JohnCM: XD
 RoboStac: I just managed to squeak through at 980
 ZarthaxX: f eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: congrats robo
 kovi: grat!
 ZarthaxX: gz robo :O
 AntiSquid: euler what was your rank last time? codejam
 JohnCM: lol what is codejam?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codejam/search/eulerscheZahl">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codejam/search/eulerscheZahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: codejam = google's coding contest, once a year
 eulerscheZahl: 1000 tshirts to win
 eulerscheZahl: so robo got lucky
 JohnCM: how long is a code jam?
 nosenfield: can somebody tell me how you output debug info into the actual game view?
 nosenfield: like, text above the pacs?
 Doju: nosenfield add it after the command
 VicHofs: append to commands
 AntiSquid: just add " msg" to the end of your output
 Doju: MOVE 0 3 13 text
 eulerscheZahl: this round was 2.5h
 nosenfield: ah, thanks much
 AntiSquid: most important thing to ask about near the end of the contest though
 eulerscheZahl: there are always about 4 problems and there's a clear correct answer
 eulerscheZahl: unlike codingame where you can do pretty much anything and your rank results from your performance against others in direct matches
 wlesavo: euler any really interesting problems?
 Beerus: 1 problem is easy 1 medium and the other just pray
 JohnCM: i see..
 JohnCM: means it is an algorithm programming in 2.5 hours
 wlesavo: this round
 JohnCM: solve as many as possible
 eulerscheZahl: either the problems weren't that interesting or i'm too stupid to see the interesting part of it
 eulerscheZahl: no interactive problem this time
 JohnCM: what's the difficulty like?
 eulerscheZahl: hard to very hard CG puzzles
 wlesavo: 1c also was without interactive ones, strange
 eulerscheZahl: some easy/medium in early stage
 JohnCM: ok sounds tough
 JohnCM: so actually doing CG gives you quite a bit of practice in it?
 wlesavo: JohnCM all of them should available rn
 eulerscheZahl: CG is really different from codejam
 Insufficient: and even though codejam is in full swing this year you can still do kickstart
 Insufficient: which is a similar google competition
 eulerscheZahl: for codejam you have to know standard algos and code much faster
 eulerscheZahl: here i can return the next day when i'm stuck
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care about kickstart
 wlesavo: kickstart is actually tomorrow i believe 
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: but CG has priority here
 eulerscheZahl: i'm so high, can't stop now
 eulerscheZahl: can't let C++ win :D
 VicHofs: 420
 wlesavo: but the problems are not that interesting, neither really hard
 JohnCM: lol
 JohnCM: their problems are the standard programming competition kind
 JohnCM: i went to have a look
 eulerscheZahl: for me CG is more fun. but just a personal preference
 Braykin08: Hey, anyone got a seed with an hallways that loops back to itself without intersection? I might have a infinite loop, but cant find a replay anymore
 Insufficient: i'm doing the odd competition on leetcode and doing cg competitions, but i'll try kickstart in a month or two maybe
 JohnCM: incremental house of pancakes is like a depth first search prob.
 eulerscheZahl: ping struct give seed for blank line
 ShannonNorris97: Anyone got any generic tips to get from silver to gold? (Besides win lots of games and lose few)
 eulerscheZahl: would timeout, you need maths to do it efficiently
 JohnCM: hmm.. then what algo did you use?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000019ffb9/ZXVsZXJzY2hlWmFobA">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000019ffb9/ZXVsZXJzY2hlWmFobA</a>you can see my submissions
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow it was wrong, some obscure off by 1 i guess
 RoboStac: oh you went for the quadratic solving
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't?
 eulerscheZahl: was expecting to timeout with naive
 JBM: i tried to use math
 RoboStac: no, I did a binary search to find out how many pancakes I could serve from each pile
 WINWINWIN: python3 is timing out by a small amount, I know enough C# to translate, is a C# rewrite enough?
 JBM: oh wait
 Cappefra: @eulescheZahl you wrote I'm so high and for a moment I thought you weren't talking about the leaderbord
 JBM: i recall a 10^18, did i lose precision
 eulerscheZahl: i see you also missed top 1000 but did better than me JBM
 JBM: yeah not too happy
 twiho: has anybody ruled out MCTS
 JBM: still don't underrstand why le b-small failed
 Doju: nooooooooooo
 Doju: i was fixing a bug
 Doju: think i got to the solution
 JBM: or my a-large
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea why my C small was wrong
 Doju: then got a new seed&#160;:(
 Doju: Is there any way to retrieve the old one?
 eulerscheZahl: but even with A large + B small + C small: not in top 1000
 JBM: i'm at that painful level where *any* next thing solved would have put me in
 JohnCM: wow haha.. this one requires serious practice
 eulerscheZahl: i'm disappointed, mainly because it's a one per year thing
 JBM: same
 JohnCM: the 2.5 hours is just spamming known algos, not really coming up with one on the spot
 eulerscheZahl: but i'll get back to CG then
 JBM: though i do get the feeling i was more adequate this time
 JBM: not through, but i feel like i could have
 eulerscheZahl: i was far off
 JBM: as in "knew without too much doubt the alg to pick", just a question of time
 JBM: and real bad strategising
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i like the tasks, sometimes i'm just clueless
 VicHofs: hey when pacs collide and kinda recoil a bit what is their position?
 JohnCM: are you allowed to copy paste code?
 JohnCM: @vichofs same pos as before they collided
 VicHofs: good ty
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know their copy-paste rules
 JBM: debugging my b-small would have been a better pick than attempting a-large
 JohnCM: anyway i guess they don't worry about ppl copying
 JBM: you can c/p what you want as long as it's legal
 JohnCM: the problems shld be new
 JBM: they have a section for this in the faq
 eulerscheZahl: but there are usually some disqualifications
 JBM: you're allowed your library of code
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if copy-paste from online sources, code sharing with other users or whatever
 JBM: disquals are more for sharing solutions and discussing problems during the round
 eulerscheZahl: i see. i only observe my rank going up after review each time without knowing details
 JBM: yeah that's the disquals
 JBM: i'd expect to see less of then in round 2
 eulerscheZahl: because only honest competitors made it to round 2
 eulerscheZahl: only -&gt; mostly
 JBM: hopefully
 eulerscheZahl: or skilled cheaters :D
 JBM: disquals have their special status in the contestant pages
 JBM: where's my list
 JBM: like this fellow for instance <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000019fef2/Uk9DS1M">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/submissions/000000000019fef2/Uk9DS1M</a>
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i saw such a profile too
 JohnCM: manually rejected haha
 eulerscheZahl: someone complained on codeforces while it was still in review
 JBM: complained that he was rejected?
 eulerscheZahl: complained that someone was cheatingbut the user got DQed then
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/75958">https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/75958</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a weird user in general, not just on codejam
 eulerscheZahl: and proud author of a book, which got sold more than 1k times according to him
 JohnCM: sounds interesting
 JohnCM: anyway i saw there's still kickstart tmr if you're interested euler
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not
 JohnCM: sounds like you have lots of experience in this algo thing
 JohnCM: what's the diff anyway between this codejam and kickstart
 JBM: what's the kickstart concept?
 JBM: yeah, same as JohnCM
 eulerscheZahl: similar to codejam but multiple rounds
 JBM: codejam *is* multiple rounds
 eulerscheZahl: like 1A 1B 1C but you can play all of them
 JBM: you mean without?
 JBM: ah, repeated ok
 Doju: Apparently my dead pacs have been casting vision all this time :o
 Doju: wonder what other bugs i have now
 eulerscheZahl: csipcsirip calm downyou know that we will catch you in the end, don't make it harder than it has to be
 kovi: nice submit csipcsirip
 AntiSquid: is that some illuminati lizard avatar?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off for dinner
 JohnCM: haha ok cya
 nosenfield: one other question, any way to get the full debug output?
 nosenfield: ie, the console clipping it after X lines?
 nosenfield: any way to actually see the full log?
 egaetan: Athight try a resubmit&#160;?
 AlluringChair: Doju my pacs are seeing pellets that are not there _-_ and i have no idea why and how
 Doju: maybe you're not clearing the list of pellets?
 Doju: or something
 Zenoscave: Woke up to gold cool
 Clagus: Zenoscave - same for me :D
 Zenoscave: Who is Lord Betrayus
 Zenoscave: gz Clagus
 eulerscheZahl: the boss that will betry you
 eulerscheZahl: betray
 Clagus: he is the Lord who Betrayed us
 Zenoscave: I should phrase that better. Which bot became the boss?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Betrayus">https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Betrayus</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: Npi2 Loup
 Clagus: oh shit
 Clagus: :D
 Zenoscave: cool
 eulerscheZahl: the boss isn't that strong considering the league size
 MattSOrme: my bot is now ranked as bad, but i don't even know why&#160;:(
 WINWINWIN: A lot more dynamic top 3 than Ocean of Code
 Zenoscave: What's the gold Meta?
 eulerscheZahl: the game is more random
 eulerscheZahl: collect pellets, win game
 eulerscheZahl: legend too
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl you never cease to have the best answers
 Clagus: "Pac is the last yellow Pac-Worlder left in Pac-World" :O&#160;;(
 Clagus: this game is more sad than I thought
 Zenoscave: Is hunarian good for cherries?
 Zenoscave: hungarian*
 struct: seems good
 struct: at least in legend there are some
 Clagus: holy crap:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Pacinator">https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Pacinator</a>
 ShannonNorris97: Today I'm making a lot of changes that it seems would really help me in the leaderboards, but then have incredibly little effect
 Zenoscave: Are there any maps where Pacs.Count&#160;!= Cherries.Count on start?
 eulerscheZahl: what are cherries?
 struct: pellets
 ShannonNorris97: super pellets
 struct: or big pellets?
 struct: oh ok
 Zenoscave: The name for the big pellets
 eulerscheZahl: super pellets is always 4
 Zenoscave: Ok thanks
 tobk: hm, just had Gold Boss timeout in 2nd turn...
 eulerscheZahl: i do that too in some rare cases
 tobk: my bot dropped 200 ranks after last "improvements"... will try an older version again. things like this can be so frustrating...
 Durkin: Got gold and decided to start a new bot- clearly genius plays
 eulerscheZahl: we've all been there
 Doju: gosh this is ugly
 Doju: i have a method that checks if two pac's next step is the same cell
 Doju: i need to do that for the next step too
 Doju: copy-paste :D
 MattSOrme: Problem is, sometimes you need to go through the reduced rank to actually fix everything properly rather than just ignoring the problem
 Braykin08: Private function, lambda, anonymous functions. Bunch of ways to avoid that
 NickStahl: Doju that is some proper competative programming there&#160;:)
 Braykin08: But I also went for copy paste&#160;:)
 tobk: meh, resubmitted bot from last night, back 200 ranks up... and I basically just refactored some duplicate code into a method, and checked that 10 times... prob should check an 11th time now
 eulerscheZahl: or submit again
 eulerscheZahl: rng is strong
 Doju: although i could fix that the real way and actually just make the function smart and check the entire path instead of just one cell
 Doju: but 38 hours left...
 Cappefra: rng?
 tobk: I already resubmitted the "improved" version twice with two more minor improvements, but hte lower rank was pretty consistent
 jrke: i challenge everybody no one would have more submission count than me
 jrke:&#160;;) 347
 Doju: jrke did you get your sim working?
 eulerscheZahl: random number generator - implying that there is some randomness in your rank
 Doju: Checking the entire path is gonna be a bit difficult...
 Cappefra: oh ok yeah
 Doju: how do you even determine which pac should yield when delaying a path might cause more collisions
 Cappefra: ok legend is not gonna be easy...
 seronis: if you know distance to target for each pacman, you have the one with the closest target yield
 Doju: yes im doing that
 Doju: but im talking about the whole path
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: do you timeout more in the IDE than in the arena?
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely test in the IDE
 Doju: actually there isn't any reason to have multiple collision points since pellets dont care which pac goes for it
 eulerscheZahl: but arena timeouts are rare. and these peaks usually timeout in the IDE too
 Doju: therefore i suppose i can just do the copy-paste and be done with it forever
 eulerscheZahl: in theory: more timeouts in the IDE as arena is release mode
 seronis: theory is wrong.   i still get random timeouts in arena with no test timeouts
 seronis: but thats why i deleted my code and started over
 dbdr: is there a big difference in C#?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't do any benchmarks yet
 MSmits: doing one right now
 MSmits:  euler    GW=41,89%    [ W=40,54%   L=56,76%   D=2,70%   ] [37]
 eulerscheZahl: toad is beating you&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, but it surprises me that it is such a small margin
 MSmits: this game really is random
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: and my bot has random bugs
 MSmits: my bot is a random bug :P
 eulerscheZahl: increasing the variance, giving everyone a chance
 dbdr: the game is more complex than it seems I think
 dbdr: my todo list is growing indefinitely :D
 MSmits: it just has a large luck factor
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465161604">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465161604</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465264062">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465264062</a>should get 1 more super pellet in both of those matches
 dbdr: I am convinced there is a huge margin of improvement
 eulerscheZahl: for my bot: definitely
 seronis: no.    how you prioritize pellets is a valid test
 eulerscheZahl: my harvesting is awful
 seronis: so you shouldnt have all tests with 'enough' pellets
 MSmits: dbdr of course, but games are still decided by one unfortunate turn
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just not sure how to code it
 dbdr: don't do that turn&#160;;)
 MSmits: you lack information
 eulerscheZahl: but we'll see on monday morning with hiders coming
 dbdr: dapo?
 MSmits: it might be that with the information known, even the best move is a move that can be countered
 eulerscheZahl: my money is on karlis o
 cegprakash: I'm thinking about adding anti accident code
 eulerscheZahl: or add accident code cegprakash
 Doju: cegprakash what does that mean?
 cegprakash: getting hit by invisible enemy
 cegprakash: that's accident
 Doju: i see
 cegprakash: usually accidents happen in signals
 eulerscheZahl: and you can try to enforce these yourself
 seronis: 'invisible' means thy enter an intersection same time as you.  you CANT prevent that
 MSmits: you can
 eulerscheZahl: damn, 11 timeouts in 500 matches
 MSmits: with a few assumptions, you can guess it 
 cegprakash: can in silver and up
 seronis: you just have to collide and then react.  you cant prevent
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465484261">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465484261</a>just do this cegprakash
 Braykin08: euler, do you have built custom tool to figure out your timeouts in the last matches, or it is displayed somewhere on the site?
 eulerscheZahl: own script
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl he got his priorities right
 eulerscheZahl: have to download each single replay, stressing the servers
 eulerscheZahl: so nothing that will be public
 cegprakash: dying to get super pellet is worth it Iguess
 cegprakash: dying for a stupid pellet is not
 eulerscheZahl: no cegprakash he just didn't see me coming, i was around the corner
 eulerscheZahl: and i wanted to make him crash
 cegprakash: but he doesn't have anti accident
 cegprakash: that's why
 cegprakash: it's upto him to choose when to do anti accident
 cegprakash: I probably will never enable anti accident when there is a super pellet in the map
 eulerscheZahl: he doesn't see me, how should he prevent it?
 cegprakash: he can see u
 cegprakash: even though he can't
 eulerscheZahl: he's speeding
 cegprakash: he can
 eulerscheZahl: you mean by tracking?
 cegprakash: ezpz
 cegprakash: yes
 eulerscheZahl: he can only guess
 cegprakash: but u have to assume that opponent's goal is to create an accident
 cegprakash: to prevent it
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, it's likely that i go to the pellet
 eulerscheZahl: if you try to dodge that, your bot will be way too shy
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: that's why enable it for stupid pellets
 cegprakash: not super pellets
 eulerscheZahl: that's just a sneaky ninja attack you can't prevent
 cegprakash: can prevent
 cegprakash: but not sure if it's worth it
 cegprakash: as u said
 eulerscheZahl: can't prevent and still play reasonably well in general
 cegprakash: oh
 seronis: considering the REAL pacman game algorithms are known,  anyone bother implementing the real 4 ghosts and see how their bot plays original&#160;?
 cegprakash: ghosts can work on closed maps I guess
 Braykin08: In the same set of ideas, I wished that the higher leagues added more player
 cegprakash: the difficulty is that ghosts are vulnerable seronis
 cegprakash: unlike in real pacman game
 seronis: would require a larger map as you would need 2 axis of symmetry
 seronis: anyone know if the spring challenge is gonna stay available after competition closes&#160;?
 jrke: yeah you can do it after challenge completion also
 Rimailleur: well, you were right, my code was very bad in the challenge&#160;! Difficult to analyse vs random enemy:)
 ShannonNorris97: Using Codingame's IDE how can I get it to implement a certain seed?
 Icebox: click on options
 eulerscheZahl: left: setting -&gt; export mode
 eulerscheZahl: expert
 ShannonNorris97: ah brilliant, thank you
 ShannonNorris97: That's weird - this one seed makes me timeout on the very first turn but with no errors or anything
 seronis: you take over 1sec to set up your board info&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: print the map input to stderr
 eulerscheZahl: and copy it to test offline
 eulerscheZahl: can you share the map?
 ShannonNorris97: definitely not over a second. It has a map print in it but it's at the end of the turn, I'll try shifting some prints about to see if I can get it to do anything
 eulerscheZahl: some have timeouts when there's a horizontal line without a single wall
 ShannonNorris97: That's it, thank you sm
 seronis: why is a horrizontal hallway bad&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: because of line of sight infinite loop
 njaber: people have an infinite loop with (x + 1)&#160;% width
 struct: ah makes sence
 seronis: ahh i already dont revisit cells so no need to care if a horizontal bar is the cause
 ShannonNorris97: Mine's from where I go through each pac's line of sight adding the pellets to the map. So by being a continuous line, it gave an infinite loop
 ShannonNorris97: ^ One of my pacs was on that line on turn 1
 semera: Sorry for repeated question.... 
 Counterbalance: it doesn't have speed left
 Counterbalance: it uses it's last speed at frame 18
 semera: wtf, I am blind.. sorry guys
 Doju: Oops, submitted a bot that would time out every now and then for stupid reasons
 cegprakash:  anyone have a seed with only 1 pac?
 MadKnight: no
 Doju: I think there is none
 cegprakash: I saw once
 Doju: are*
 MadKnight: yea i think it's 2+
 MadKnight: maybe it was in wood&#160;?
 cegprakash: no silver
 seronis: constraints at least says 2-5
 seronis: though other puzzles sometimes disobey listed constraints
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/LeagueRules.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/LeagueRules.java</a> only wood2 has 1 pac it seems
 SurajMishra2209: reached rank 5 in arena and fell down to 70 :D
 cegprakash: no way which league SurajMishra2209
 RavenKZP: yes i was 20 -&gt; fixed or add something = fall to 150 xp
 cegprakash: it's good not to fix some bugs
 cegprakash: that way u are less predictable
 seronis: cant you just submit again, get a new set of opponents and recalc rank&#160;?
 SurajMishra2209: lol...bronze 
 cegprakash: hey SurajMishra2209 do u go to closest pellet?
 cegprakash: if u go to closest pellet u can reach gold
 SurajMishra2209: closest to pellet? I didn't get it?
 cegprakash: ur pacs should go to their closest pellets
 seronis: that seems like a travesty.   merely closest pellet should be bronze
 jrke: hey ceg i am not using speed is that ok
 cegprakash: I reached gold with closest pellet
 cegprakash: it's not okay jrke
 jrke: K
 cegprakash: speed is always preferred to shield
 cegprakash: *switch
 SurajMishra2209: in some cases....what I have seen is I lose because of the bad rollback mechanism that I have in case I don't have any visible pellets
 seronis: no?
 seronis: if an enemy is IMMEDIATELY beside you,  switch.  otherwise speed
 jrke: and my pac don't collaborate how to fix that
 cegprakash: don't rollback anything SurajMishra2209
 cegprakash: add speed to ur wood code
 cegprakash: and that should take u silver
 Kukiss: +1  ^^^^
 SurajMishra2209: cool....will give it a go
 cegprakash: then start team work with ur pacs and u are in gold
 cegprakash: that's what I did
 jrke: how to collab with my pacs
 cegprakash: talk to each other
 cegprakash: take a collaborative decision
 wicked_: using tcp/ip?
 SurajMishra2209: I guess that's the problem here....I started building on shared knowledge between the pacs...and I never really could reach silver
 cegprakash: no just if else
 cegprakash: wicked_
 jrke: K
 wicked_: jk&#160;:)
 cegprakash: SurajMishra2209 do that after reaching silver
 SurajMishra2209: cool
 cegprakash: don't do magic that others don't do 
 cegprakash: or it's difficult to promote
 cegprakash: unless u are a meta maker
 SurajMishra2209: gotcha
 RavenKZP: i cant get to gold couse my pacs are suicide since... always i try to teach them to dont go to enemy but they still want to die :D
 cegprakash: I think gold to legend is to make bugs so that we get less predictable.. everyone predicts opponents in gold&#160;:(
 cegprakash: RavenKZP lol u have bad collision detection
 cegprakash: assume enemy's intention is to kill u on next turn RavenKZP
 cegprakash: that way u are safe
 cegprakash: and u can avoid that
 SurajMishra2209: currently at 34 in bronze...hopefully this change will take me to silver
 RavenKZP: i have detection but bugged :D
 RavenKZP: thats my problem
 RavenKZP: sometimes my pac follow enemy until he finally kill them :D
 seronis: never seek out enemy to attack.  defend or run
 H1ggsb0s0n: Yes, attacking is a losing strategy
 H1ggsb0s0n: you'll never be able to catch up tot he pac you're following and it will eat everything in front of it
 seronis: you chase the enemy who is eating pellets and earning points
 seronis: or because you move towards it first,  it sits still, switches, and you die
 seronis: attacking = losing
 Icebox: I'm sure euler sitting in the top of legend with his aggresive attacking strat would dissagree with you but hey
 RavenKZP: hahah i found it
 RavenKZP: when opponent ability was 0 then it was invisible for my pacs :D
 Neumann: Are there any people in legend with small depth search&#160;? (&lt;4)
 Doju: Euler has said that he's doing 4
 lifetimeLearner007: cegprakash: I think gold to legend is to make bugs so that we get less predictable.. 
 WINWINWIN: :P
 Doju: Time to dive into the probabilities
 Doju: so far i've only had 1s and 0s
 VicHofs: damn it was against inky but
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465706291">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465706291</a>
 VicHofs: this one was tough lol
 Doju: VicHofs are you using bfs?
 VicHofs: yep
 Doju: okay, one tip
 Doju: consider other pacs as walls
 seronis: who is NOT using some type of bfs&#160;?
 Doju: easy to implement, huge reward
 VicHofs: sure about that?
 Doju: seronis a lot of people who think it's not worth it to do
 Doju: VicHofs yup, i jumped like 800 ranks when i did that
 VicHofs: I think I might miss out on some pellets
 VicHofs: ok I'll test it then
 seronis: my fist code had a bfs and was under 120 lines including empty lines, comments, and default code
 Doju: You can tweak it later if you want but it's such an easy thing that its totally worth it to do
 VicHofs: hmm
 Doju: how was your code under 120 lines!?
 VicHofs: dude at this point honestly I just think I'm unlucky
 seronis: because a simplified BFS doesnt require hardly anything ...
 VicHofs: I've done every possible tweak I could think of
 VicHofs: and nothing
 Doju: my bfs functions (2 of them) are 60 lines in total
 VicHofs: odds are I'll try that too and have it backfire
 Doju: to be fair they aren't the simplest onest possible
 Doju: VicHofs i'm almost certain that it'll be a huge improvement
 Doju: looking at that replay your pacs are following eachother and grouping up for no reason
 VicHofs: we'll see
 Doju: that will prevent that
 VicHofs: yeah that is happening
 VicHofs: will it?
 VicHofs: how?
 Doju: yes
 Doju: mostly
 VicHofs: I was trying to think of a way to deal with it
 Doju: that's a super easy fix
 Doju: not a perfect one though
 VicHofs: aight then
 VicHofs: treating enemy and friendly pacs as walls?
 VicHofs: or just opponents
 Doju: both
 VicHofs: ok easy to do at least
 VicHofs: I'm at rank 300 rn
 VicHofs: I'll implement that and see if it helps
 VicHofs: but honestly my money
 Doju: lemme know what happens
 VicHofs: 's on nothing lmao
 Doju: lol
 VicHofs: aight
 VicHofs: well against inky in my tests I lost 2/5
 Doju: umm
 Doju: are you sure you did it correctly?
 Doju: that was a huge jump for me
 VicHofs: not sure whether it's a huge improvement
 VicHofs: yeah
 VicHofs: I run BFS for a set time so it doesn't time out
 Doju: can you send me a replay?
 VicHofs: yeah sure thing
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465724560">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465724560</a>
 VicHofs: one I lost^
 Doju: it's not working
 Doju: assuming your logic is closest pellet
 VicHofs: oh wait no
 VicHofs: my bad
 VicHofs: I did fuck up
 VicHofs: easy fix tho
 VicHofs: one sec
 VicHofs: I fixed it but now I'm timing out every game
 Doju: umm
 Doju: what do you resort to if you don't find a target
 VicHofs: depends
 Doju: hm
 VicHofs: if there are superpellets, a random one among them
 VicHofs: but that wouldn't explain the timeouts
 Doju: okay...
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: it wouldnt
 Doju: oh sorry, i meant if bfs doesn't find a target
 VicHofs: Yeah that's what I meant tho
 Doju: ok
 VicHofs: if it goes over the time limit I set
 Doju: well, send me a replay where you time out?
 VicHofs: it just picks a random superpellets
 Doju: and what's causing it to time out?
 Doju: bfs?
 VicHofs: okay
 Doju: it shouldn't be that slow
 VicHofs: no idea yet
 VicHofs: but since I'm timing out only now that I changed the logic it must be that
 Doju: yes
 Doju: but what's the root cause
 Doju: does it not give an error?
 VicHofs: nope
 VicHofs: just timing out
 Doju: huh.
 Doju: then you must have an infinite loop somewhere
 Doju: or reeeally crappy code haha
 Doju: if you're not doing anything special
 VicHofs: here u go
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465730909">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465730909</a>
 Doju: it's definitely still not working
 cegprakash: is board width always ODD?
 Doju: cegprakash i think it is
 VicHofs: I don't think so
 VicHofs: I just played on a 30x11
 Doju: hmm....
 Doju: what if you tell them to ignore the super pellets
 cegprakash: alright I think it shouldn't matter for symmetricity
 Doju: can you easily do that?
 VicHofs: ignore as in not even do bfs?
 Doju: don't give super pellets more value than normal pellets
 Adnmaster: they do
 cegprakash: why not Doju
 Doju: cegprakash to debug
 Doju: because they are definitely finding the same target there in that replay
 Doju: but it might be from the other direction
 Doju: and if you use the default pathfinding they're still gonna take the same path
 Doju: but if they take different paths it would clearly show that they aren't finding paths through eachother
 [Csongor]: Why can't get a path (do a different path finding) to every "field" of the game. And why don't I get any errors while trying to do that?
 cegprakash: he doesn't have team cooperation.. apart from that it looks fine to me
 Doju: cegprakash that's why i recommended to consider pacs to be walls in the bfs
 Doju: that'll instantly give you a pretty decent-ish level of cooperation
 cegprakash: can work
 cegprakash: but that's costly in time
 Doju: no?
 Doju: why would it be
 cegprakash: I never do BFS in my sim
 cegprakash: I only do a BFS on turn 1
 cegprakash: start of the game
 lifetimeLearner007: but then u wouldn't know the best path with most pellets on other turns right, cegprakash?
 Doju: he's simming lifetimeLearner007
 cegprakash: I know lifetimeLearner007
 cegprakash: I predict the future detecting all my future collisions
 VicHofs: tried ignoring superpellets
 VicHofs: still timing out
 lifetimeLearner007: does monte carlo come under simulation?
 Doju: what does the replay look like?
 cegprakash: lifetimeLearner007 yes it does
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465738273">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465738273</a>
 VicHofs: plus I get rekt cause I don't get the superpellets
 lifetimeLearner007: i started implementing monte carlo but getting timed out. running that only for 25sec though, still timing out.
 lifetimeLearner007: 25ms*
 Doju: okay it looks like its working but lemme see another replay just to be sure
 seronis: i use BFS purely to find either closest pellet or shorted path to a goal.    are most of you using BFS to find  'most pellets within an X length path'  ?
 lifetimeLearner007: for heuristics, it is fine but for simulation, its not.
 cegprakash: VicHofs turn 20+ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81</a>
 VicHofs: yes
 cegprakash: go to a history of ur submissions when u don't have a timeout
 cegprakash: and see what u added
 cegprakash: use diffchecker.com
 cegprakash: that's what I use
 Doju: he added pacs as walls
 VicHofs: I know what I did
 VicHofs: Doju's suggestion
 Doju: but that shouldn't still be causing timeouts
 VicHofs: I would be nice to try out but yeah
 cegprakash: he has bug in BFS then
 cegprakash: how me ur BFS code alone VicHofs
 cegprakash: show*
 VicHofs: I've sent it in pseucode before but no one found any bugs
 VicHofs: sure you wanna look?
 cegprakash: send pseudo code again
 VicHofs: aight
 KoreN-: how to debug in java?
 cegprakash: 1) u should mark visited before u push into queue2) check if visited before pushing into queue
 VicHofs: did those
 cegprakash: check again
 VicHofs: 'correctly' might be a bit iffy
 VicHofs: but I did
 cegprakash: check again
 cegprakash: till u fix
 cegprakash: if ur bfs runs more than 0.000001 seconds u have bug there
 Doju: how fast did your bfs run before pacs were walls?
 cegprakash: walls doesn't matter
 cegprakash: any bfs runs in O(width*height)
 Doju: erm
 Doju: isn't it like nodes * edges?
 cegprakash: nopes
 cegprakash: it's nodes
 PippiCoder: anyone doing this in java?
 cegprakash: + edges
 PippiCoder: I'm confused a bit xD
 seronis: my bfs didnt both checking visited before pushing.  it checked visited before examing current cell and then bailed.   fewer total checks
 Doju: you're right
 Doju: + edges
 Doju: umm
 Doju: that's slower though
 Doju: it had to push it into the queue
 seronis: is there a way to find the code i had before&#160;?
 cegprakash: seronis that's wrong
 cegprakash: fix it
 cegprakash: can run 1000 times slower
 Quidome: @seronis it is in your history
 Quidome: Click on the left on history and you see your commits
 Quidome: Click on the arrow and you can send back your code to the IDE
 seronis: ty.  i had assumed that was battle history / replay stuff.   not code history
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03ff5fd9-2a97-48a1-bf39-56c760ce39d8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03ff5fd9-2a97-48a1-bf39-56c760ce39d8</a>
 VicHofs: in case you wanna see
 VicHofs: @cegprakash @Doju
 Doju: erm
 Doju: i think it should be while len(queue) &gt; 0
 Doju: or at least that's what i'm doing
 Doju: actually i'm doing while len(queue) &gt; 1 because i'm also pushing in Nones as markers but anyways you get the idea
 VicHofs: well I tried while True before
 VicHofs: so same dif
 VicHofs: but I was timing out sometimes
 Doju: its not
 Doju: that's exactly what your issue is
 VicHofs: wym
 cegprakash: VicHofs it looks so wrong
 cegprakash: does not follow both the conditions I said
 VicHofs: thanks
 VicHofs: yeah it does tho lol
 VicHofs: I set visited before sending to queue
 VicHofs: and also check if visited beforehand
 Doju: there's no exit condition there
 Doju: apart from timing out
 Doju: no wonder why it's timing out
 cegprakash: before starting bfs u need to push start to the queue and make it as visited
 VicHofs: I did though
 cegprakash: make it visited first before pushing
 Doju: like what's even happening there lol
 VicHofs: don;t you see it?
 VicHofs: Doju the timeout isn't 50ms
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: u are not marking it visited
 VicHofs: I set it as custom
 cegprakash: after u push
 VicHofs: 10ms for each
 VicHofs: cegprakash maybe I misunderstand what you mean then
 VicHofs: could you elaborate?
 Doju: yes but
 Doju: you're just looping until it hits the time
 Doju: not exiting when the queue is empty
 VicHofs: yep
 Doju: that makes no sense
 Doju: you want to exit when you've checked all the cells
 Doju: aka the queue is empty
 Doju: no wonder why it's timing out
 VicHofs: but it won't be empty unless I have walls around me 360 deg right
 VicHofs: I can time that solution too but idk
 VicHofs: *try
 Doju: aghhh
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab02dee4-6b17-4587-9f65-79225b34c6eb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab02dee4-6b17-4587-9f65-79225b34c6eb</a>
 Doju: yes
 Doju: that
 cegprakash: this is what u need VicHofs
 Doju: also add in if neighbor in targets return neighbor
 Doju: VicHofs what your code was doing is this:
 Doju: Oh ok imma loop over all the cells, nice
 Doju: no target found but all cells are visited?
 Doju: oh i need to go back to start. Oh i need to go back to start. Oh i need to go back to start. Oh i need to go back to start. Oh time is up
 cegprakash: lololol Doju
 VicHofs: ok I'll switch it around
 Daher: Hello
 Zenoscave: cegprakash are you legend?
 cegprakash: no Zenoscave
 cegprakash: but I'll
 cegprakash: adding enemy tracker
 cegprakash: I'm done with random bugs pushing me high
 cegprakash: and me wondering why the same bot stucks at 100+ rank
 Doju: Oh lol i've been here writing some code
 Zenoscave: Do you do BFS for pathfinding still/
 Zenoscave:&#160;?
 Doju: and meanwhile i've climbed from 100 to 30 in silver
 cegprakash: Zenoscave ofc
 cegprakash: same bfs code I added in wood2 I'm using still now
 Zenoscave: When do you stop BFS on target or on no more neighbors?
 Doju: both
 cegprakash: I only do bfs on turn 1 at game start
 Doju: or depends on what you want
 Doju: anyways you always stop it when the queue is empty
 Doju: but if you hit a target that you like you can stop it earlier
 Doju: also
 Doju: anyways you always stop it when the queue is empty
 Doju: VicHofs
 Doju: xD
 Doju: I think i'm gonna time out with my current plan
 Doju: looping pretty much over every cell for every cell and doing a bunch of math
 Doju: on every move
 stakka: how do you determine a target / desired position for a pac? not talking about the pathfinding aspect, but wondering where to send them in the first place
 Doju: stakka that's the point of the contest pretty much
 Doju: it's up to you to figure it out
 stakka: thought so
 stakka: fair enough :D
 Doju: but i'll tell you that you can get decently far with naive approaches
 Doju: if you consider rank 40 in silver as decently far then i'm speaking form experience
 stakka: just wondering because I saw you discussing BFS
 stakka: that would imply you're looking beyond just your neighbours
 Vidundret: :crab:
 NickStahl: Doju, your doing great&#160;:) I gave up
 Doju: NickStahl noo
 NickStahl: If you keep it up you will end up in gold!
 Doju: you can still climb
 Doju: i'm almost definitely gonna get gold if i get this thing working
 Doju: but it might take some fine-tuning
 VicHofs: Ok I fixed the whileloop
 NickStahl: Doju, I know, but tomorrow I am away for the whole day and I'm kind of done with it for now&#160;:)
 Doju: Ah okay NickStahl
 VicHofs: still timing out tho
 VicHofs: :upside_down:
 Doju: VicHofs send in a new round of pseudocode xd
 VicHofs: its the same tho lol
 VicHofs: except with the while loop considering if the queue is empty
 NickStahl: I should work on some algo stuff so I can implement something better next time than if, then elses&#160;:)
 Doju: so your while loop now contains "or queue is empty"
 Doju: now you need to make sure you aren't pushing the same cell into the queue multiple times
 Doju: make sure you're catching it if it's already visited
 VicHofs: def BFS_target(self, start, targets): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7fe77bbf-74ce-44df-a2bc-63c48428ceec">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7fe77bbf-74ce-44df-a2bc-63c48428ceec</a>
 VicHofs: The visited thing is working I'm pretty sure
 cegprakash: VicHofs I literally gave u the code
 cegprakash: u are not making the start visited
 cegprakash: before the while loop
 VicHofs: oh my bad
 VicHofs: in the pseudocode I really am not
 VicHofs: but in the actual code I am
 maddoggg: print("Hi")
 VicHofs: visited = {start}
 Doju: that wouldn't cause it to time out though
 cegprakash: are u popping the queue on the first line of ur BFS?
 cegprakash: Doju it will
 Doju: right, good point
 MonZtaDeluxe: anyways - i'm in silver -  i give up (tried to code again from scratch, my new concept is too slow) - cya next contest&#160;:)
 Doju: cegprakash no it wont since it gets set as visited when the next cell over checks it
 cegprakash: I can't see a remove (pop) in his pseudo code
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: if you're using a deque make sure you do deque.popleft()
 Doju: instead of deque.pop()
 MonZtaDeluxe: guys - c++/c# - is there a huge difference in performance?
 cegprakash: I also don
 cegprakash: he just needs 1 loop
 cegprakash: or 1 more to check the level..
 Doju: true
 Doju: it's a miracle how that wasn't timing out before hahah
 Doju: but it's good that it's getting fixed
 Doju: learning opportunity
 cegprakash: yeah beginner mistakes
 cegprakash: bfs timeout was one of the hardest things to understand when I was in college :D
 Doju: or not-enough-coffee mistakes
 Doju: im going all in, calling this new movement method "magic()"
 Doju: just to make sure it works
 Doju: It's a pain how i built this thing
 Doju: needs to work in a recursive loop
 cegprakash: what
 cegprakash: did u just say recursion :O
 Doju: yeah i have some collaboration logic working recursively
 lifetimeLearner007: i'm doing monte carlo but getting timed out frequently, till then I've higher points. When I run that in local, I get output but in CG,its timed out. any suggestions?
 Doju: nothing fancy
 Doju: lifetimeLearner007 your machine is faster than the CG servers
 cegprakash: sometimes when I have 2 bugs 1 bug compensates another and ends up being a good bot. But when I fix 1 of them other bug is exposed and it becomes a disaster
 Doju: Maybe make the depth variable based on the time elapsed
 Doju: cegprakash yup, it happens
 lifetimeLearner007: doing only depth 1 so far. (facepalm)
 Doju: hm
 Doju: python? 
 Doju: :D
 lifetimeLearner007: JS
 cegprakash: lifetimeLearner007 depth=1 good till silver
 cegprakash: may be few have reached to gold as well
 lifetimeLearner007: I'm trying to reach silver, cegprakash
 Doju: what on earth
 Doju: isn't that such a pain to implement?
 seronis: the server has a weird ranking formula where merely fighting a lower rank person will lower your own rank, even when you beat them
 Doju: at least as far as i've understood
 lifetimeLearner007: if i fix this timeout, then i think i have a shot to reach silver
 cegprakash: u are facing bfs timeouts too?
 struct: seronis the ranking difference has to be quite big for that to happen
 lifetimeLearner007: i guess that's the reason, cegprakash
 seronis: i hadnt actually submitted anything in several days so my rank was like 2300.  havent lost a match yet in this submition but my rank keeps jumping both up and down
 RustyCrown: how come i cant read the type of enemy pacs?
 struct: that is normal
 lifetimeLearner007: ur rank depends on other bots too, seronis. so, if other bots are better than urs, then u'll go down
 struct: people keep submiting
 lifetimeLearner007: hardly 1.5 days left
 RustyCrown: oh so you cant know what type they are?
 struct: RustyCrown you can know the pacs type of enemy
 Doju: yes you can
 Braykin08: If you are bronze and up, you only see enemy pacs that are in your line of sight
 struct: they give it in inputs
 Doju: why can i not collapse a class in the editor
 Astrobytes: Hover over the line numbers
 Doju: clicking on the arrow only collapses the __init__ Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Works OK for C++ :shrug:
 Doju: irritating&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Just tried in Python and works fine for me?
 Doju: other ones work fine but it's just one that doesn't
 Astrobytes: What's different about it?
 Doju: i don't think there's anything different
 Astrobytes: Take a good look to be sure
 Doju: oh 2 don't work
 Doju: lemme see if there's something in common
 Doju: can't really think of anything
 AntiSquid: i see people who were at #2 in gold dropped to #60 or worse, i would be fking angry, dunno how they feel lol :D
 Doju: that must be a pain
 Doju: so close to legend
 AntiSquid: the gold boss divide doesn't make much sense, you get lucky and get promoted or get unlucky and get dropped
 wlesavo: true
 BenjaminUrquhart: I got lucky and rank increased
 wlesavo: my legend submit could easily end up at #100 in gold
 KCrown: how many people in the gold and legend leagues? anyone know?
 BenjaminUrquhart: gold has 433
 BenjaminUrquhart: legend has 72

 KCrown: that is a lot ... lol 
 cegprakash: wait what
 cegprakash: I can't see through enemy pac?
 Nerchio: you can
 cegprakash: i turned off kill and at turn 18-24 I don't know what my pacs are doing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465819864">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465819864</a>
 cegprakash: may be my pellet tracking has bugs :O
 cegprakash: this is sad news
 VicHofs: I am removing from the queue cegprakash
 VicHofs: sorry wasn't here
 Doju: VicHofs is the queue ever empty
 VicHofs: not sure I'd have to debug to find out for sure
 Doju: print something out when you know it's empty
 VicHofs: which I am doing now
 TheNirl: good god these achievement bleeps scare the bejeezus out of me
 VicHofs: same lol
 VicHofs: back when I didn't know what they were
 cegprakash: better to print everything u push VicHofs say if u start bfs from 0,0, it should then print 0,1   then 1,0 then 1,1 then 2,1 then 1,2 then 2,2 and so on
 VicHofs: yep that's what I'm doing now
 VicHofs: I'll report afterward
 VicHofs: ty guys
 Doju: cegprakash VicHofs do be careful with that though - it can time out because of the prints
 cegprakash: lol no Doju 
 VicHofs: yeah I gotchu
 cegprakash: it's just 35x17 points
 Doju: cegprakash oh yes it can if you print enough things
 cegprakash: I print thousands of characters on errorstream
 cegprakash: :D
 Doju: i'm not sure what i printed
 Doju: maybe a bit more than just the cells
 Doju: but i debugged a timeout which was caused by my prints for 2 hours
 cegprakash: my pellet tracking got screwed as I added tracking dead pellets
 ZarthaxX: Doju yeah happened to me on a contest..
 ZarthaxX: was getting pure timeouts on submit only
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 HiIamFriend: my brain is burning
 HiIamFriend: i will start over
 HiIamFriend: fuck it
 semera: just interesting question for me, how much time did you spent with writing, improving and bugfixing movement resolution?
 HiIamFriend: movement is cancer
 Doju: movement is fun
 semera: movement is nice, but resolution... :D
 Doju: although a pain to fix
 Icebox: recursion is cancer
 HiIamFriend: some shitty enemy codes stuck in in corners and you have nothing to do
 HiIamFriend: lovely
 Doju: oh right movement for pellets only is fun
 Doju: movement for dealing with enemies isnt fun
 Doju: xd
 HiIamFriend: exactly
 Doju: Just making a new movement thing that will run on pure magic
 Doju: hoping it'll give better results than my current, very naive, approach
 Doju: Maybe i should time things before i start adding more features...
 VicHofs: Doju BFS is running forever when checking for empty queue
 VicHofs: why does the queue have to be empty tho
 Doju: agh
 Doju: it'll be empty when you have checked all the cells
 VicHofs: I think mine is never empty alright
 Doju: then you're adding already visited cells into the queue
 HiIamFriend: and why did they have to make imputs so cancer
 VicHofs: Yeah but doesn't that lead to a timeout?
 VicHofs: checking every single one
 Doju: yes, it does
 Doju: no
 Doju: lol no
 VicHofs: what
 HiIamFriend: scan pallets
 HiIamFriend: move to big ones
 HiIamFriend: then move to small ones closes to you
 HiIamFriend: i guess
 VicHofs: ya ik
 HiIamFriend: or if you are smart
 HiIamFriend: you can check areas with most pallets
 Doju: i check every cell for every cell and it takes me 100 ms on python with no optimization
 HiIamFriend: but i am not a mas ermind
 VicHofs: yeah that's tough
 Doju: you can most definitely run it from one cell to all the others in time
 VicHofs: huh
 VicHofs: idk then
 VicHofs: I rewound my code back to when it wasn't timing out
 Doju: that was a mess
 Doju: honestly use manhattan rather than that version
 VicHofs: I don't really get what's wrong with it still tho
 VicHofs: like I get that it times out
 VicHofs: but idk why
 Doju: you're adding things to the queue even though they've been checked
 Doju: therefore the queue is never empty
 Doju: and it will run forever
 VicHofs: I'm working on a movement base tho
 VicHofs: I think I know what you mean
 VicHofs: but I'm registering move sequences instead of just the cells
 cegprakash: can I double collide on a speed turn?
 Edrevan: yes
 cegprakash: oh
 Edrevan: speed is a "normal" move, its just that pacs that have speed get 2 moves in one turn
 Edrevan: So everyone moves, then the pacs that have speed move again. And you do collision everytime
 cegprakash: so the path finding is 1 move at a time
 cegprakash: right?
 Doju: VicHofs i'm doing like 40 bfs per turn and it runs in 6 ms
 cegprakash: not based on targete
 Doju: Okay maybe not 40
 VicHofs: lemme explain cause I think it wasn't clear
 Doju: more like 20
 VicHofs: from the pseudocode and what not
 HiIamFriend: why palets input is a string
 VicHofs: I use strings to determine moves
 HiIamFriend: so anoying
 VicHofs: L for left, U for up and so on
 Doju: k
 VicHofs: those are in a dictionary containing what moves they represent
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fb7c51a-5129-4bb8-8167-aa2e943f6d4d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fb7c51a-5129-4bb8-8167-aa2e943f6d4d</a>
 VicHofs: and I go checking every combination of moves by using string concatenation
 VicHofs: for example
 Edrevan: cegprakash Yes, one move at a time. If your pac is in 1,1 and you output "MOVE 3 1", it does a pathfinding to find the shortest path between 1 1 and 3 1. Let's say it finds 1,1 -&gt; 2,1 -&gt; 3,1.
 VicHofs: the queue starts containing just <i></i>
 VicHofs: so essentially nothing in string terms
 Edrevan: cegprakash Then if your pac has speed, its first move will be from 1,1 to 2,1. Then its second move will be 2,1 to 3,1
 VicHofs: then for each of the directions I concatenate that empty string with the letter that represents a move
 cegprakash: okay so I change my sim to let it collide twice
 cegprakash: :D
 VicHofs: so lets say when I try <i> + 'U' it's invalid</i>
 VicHofs: because there's a wall there
 VicHofs: None of the next combinations tried will start with a U.
 Edrevan: cegprakash yep&#160;:)
 VicHofs: the rest is just base BFS
 VicHofs: works the same in logic
 VicHofs: and idk what's wrong with this lol
 Doju: then you can't go around walls
 Doju: ah
 Doju: just
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search</a>
 Doju: there's some decent pseudocode there
 Doju: have a read 
 VicHofs: I can go around
 VicHofs: I just can't go through
 VicHofs: the moves won't start with U
 VicHofs: but I can still have, for example, RRULL
 VicHofs: provided no walls interfere
 VicHofs: I did it by registering moves because at first I didn't know the game calculated the shortest path on its own
 VicHofs: so I would need the sequence
 VicHofs: to get there fast
 VicHofs: so now that I know about that mechanic I -could- theoretically rewrite it without the moveseqs but idk if I have the energy for that at this point lol
 VicHofs: I'd basically have to rewrite the whole logic
 MattSOrme: hmm, just started getting the weird flush error again&#160;:/
 MattSOrme: I don't know how i fixed it last time
 Kellthazar: tat[[
 Kellthazar: thats weird, cant get the codesync extension working on my sister notebook
 Doju: I seriously need to do this math with numpy...
 MarekM:&#160;:)

 romanshevchuk: which place should I be in order to be promoted to the next league?
 Cappefra: technically first... you need to be up enough that your submit fights the boss and mostly wins
 Cappefra: then you're placed first and you get promoted
 romanshevchuk: woah and I thought 20-30 would be good enough
 Zandy156: anyone higher than the boss gets promoted 
 Cappefra: it is, if you get to around 20 or 30 in average if you keep resubmitting the same code you'll end up being promoted because of the randomness
 romanshevchuk: what if the boss is some legend level algorithm?
 Cappefra: well then it would be the legend boss :D
 romanshevchuk: :D 
 cegprakash: I've never been able to catch up my 3 day old bot which had full of bugs :D
 cegprakash: so I just keep submitting that code once in a while
 cegprakash: hoping with mere luck it'll enter legend
 cegprakash: lul
 cegprakash: and I've no idea why that bot works
 cegprakash: and my latest code does not
 cegprakash: I mean I know why it does not because I lose games.. But I don't know why it loses :D 
 cegprakash: now that many good bots reached legend may be my pleb bot has a chance
 Cappefra: lol
 cegprakash: to get to the boss and actually wreck him
 Cappefra: good point, that gives me hope
 PippiCoder: guys, got a question
 PippiCoder: I'm a bit of a noob with bots, how do I handle multiple pacs?
 PippiCoder: lol
 PippiCoder: I don't get this x y thing,  it just says that its the coordniates of the closest gem?
 cegprakash: u get all visible pellets
 cegprakash: store them in an array and find the closest
 PippiCoder: Good shit, thanks bro
 PippiCoder: Any other tips? xD
 cegprakash: it's like u are programming into a pacman to work for u
 cegprakash: have fun PippiCoder
 cegprakash: that's the tip
 cegprakash: :D
 PippiCoder: finally being a manager
 PippiCoder: I need to call my mom
 PippiCoder: She will be proud
 cegprakash: u got promotion?
 PippiCoder: Not yet xD
 PippiCoder: I mean pacman manager
 PippiCoder: I got pacmans under me
 PippiCoder: Pacman team
 PippiCoder: lol
 cegprakash: lolz
 AlluringChair: ok i'm done, i've wasted countless hours on trying to fix my code which is over 1000 lines and still almost nothing works as it should. i should've started simple i guess
 cegprakash: what league u in
 Xlos: Honestly I think having unit tests would be a very good idea at this code size
 Xlos: I'm too lazy to make them though
 AlluringChair: what are uni tests
 Xlos: For each function you make, you also write a function to test if it works
 Xlos: or several
 AlluringChair: i'm still in bronze cause my code either times out or have some none type error at some point
 Xlos: for example for sort and array, you would create a function that puts in some elements and see the output is sorted
 Xlos: Yeah it's hard to debug from the site output
 AlluringChair: also i've made a stupid overcomplicated road system.
 AlluringChair: and i'm basing everything else on it
 Zandy156: definitely should start simple
 AlluringChair: and it's probably cause of all m problems
 AlluringChair: the cause*
 Zandy156: you could always start over
 AlluringChair: eh it's too late, i'm leaving in 6h and i still have to go to sleep.. anyway, at least i've learned my lesson not to overthing everything before implementing basics
 stakka: that is a valid lesson indeed
 AntiSquid: so i can beat boss more often in the IDE but can't beat mid gold bots :D
 cegprakash: AntiSquid exactly
 AntiSquid: are you using enemy prediction cegprakash&#160;?
 cegprakash: the bottom bots are all bots like ours
 cegprakash: killing each other
 cegprakash: so we never get caliberated high
 AntiSquid: huge bottleneck
 Durkin: woot woot
 cegprakash: AntiSquid just testing it AntiSquid getting rekt
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465907462">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465907462</a> game are like this
 cegprakash: my bot suddenly started using switch unnecessarily predicting opponent will not move
 AntiSquid: i actually beat it by a decent margin
 cegprakash: I now assume opponent will kill me if I go near him
 AntiSquid: ya good idea
 cegprakash: but that's the same strat bot that's in rank 40 as well.. (3 days old bot)
 AntiSquid: my Tuesday bot ranks highest so whatever :D
 AntiSquid: it's like beating boss is a step back
 tomatoes: i think most bots focus on collecting, not killing
 Clagus: are dead enemy pacs always visible? or only if I can see their location?
 tomatoes: always, each turn
 thethiny: I think in gold always, in silver not always
 thethiny: but idk
 Clagus: tomatoes thx!
 Clagus: ok, I'm gold so good to know thethiny
 thethiny: cool then!
 EvModder: whoops, just submitted code crashes on move 1
 EvModder: free +1 for everyone else in legend i guess
 thethiny: I just checked, I can always see MY dead pacs lol
 AntiSquid: boss kills 2 of mine i still win <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465921608">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465921608</a>
 AntiSquid: if i submit my rank will sink though :D
 tomatoes: i changed 1.0 to 0.5 in one place and jumped from 200+ to 20 :thinking:
 Kukiss: nice one
 cegprakash: wait what
 cegprakash: 9 win out off 19 caliberated to #25
 cegprakash: 9 win out of 10*
 cegprakash: Did my bugs got fixed :O
 cegprakash: 12 wins in 13 go go go
 cegprakash: finally my anti accident code is working
 Zenoscave: anti accident? 
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: accident = meeting in corners by accident
 cegprakash: and end up dying
 Zenoscave: How do you do that? enemy tracking?
 cegprakash: when not in vision
 cegprakash: yes
 Zenoscave: Seems like enemy tracking is a good idea.
 Zenoscave: Perhaps there are other uses for it
 cegprakash: well most of my loses and randomness in ranking was mainly because of random accidents
 cegprakash: that's why I spent today to do that
 cegprakash: this might reach legend but I may be over confident
 cegprakash: 15% rank 25
 Zenoscave: How do you keep your pacs from blocking each other.
 cegprakash: I simulate collisions
 SparshMc07: hej duo
 Zenoscave: Excluding entire target path of previously chosen pacs seems overkill
 MattSOrme: oof. come on. So close to promotion!!!
 cegprakash: alright I overreacted with the initial boost
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465935448">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/465935448</a>
 cegprakash: problem with simmingn
 cegprakash: 1 bad move and I'm ruined
 Kukiss: but it is probably hard to say was it a very much edge case or there something big broken ..
 Kukiss: i looks like a very specific case
 Kukiss: it*
 thethiny: My best submit is not good enough
 thethiny: Quitting time :D
 MattSOrme: can i get bumped up just by other people challenging me and losing?
 thethiny: this was the most learning experience I've ever had in my life
 thethiny: the amount of algorithms I had to come up with, search, learn about, and optimizations, is sth I've never encountered before.
 thethiny: And the sense of promotion, even if it meant there are people better than you, makes the learning experience better
 Kukiss: competitions like these happen here few times a year, look here from time to time&#160;;) or watch your email
 thethiny: I'm surely gonna!
 EvModder: alright, time to resubmit my bot and see if not crashing on the 1st move every time helps&#160;:'D
 MattSOrme: If i could just boost my  league score by just 1 point for just 1 minute that'd be great
 BenWo: evening all
 EvModder: hallo&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I definitely have some bug in collision
 cegprakash: this shouldn'tb e happening
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/465956754">https://www.codingame.com/replay/465956754</a>
 BenWo: I'm never gonna get this done before the contest ends&#160;:/
 cegprakash: turn 134: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81</a>
 BenWo: rofl wow that ending
 cegprakash: oh I get it now
 cegprakash: I don't have collision check in my mutation
 cegprakash: damn
 BenWo: oh nice, I just fixed a bug too
 cegprakash: I'm debugging this 1 seed for like 1 hour
 cegprakash: :D
 BenWo: lol that was me last night
 BenWo: except i think it was 3 hours to figure out an infinite loop
 cegprakash: that hurts
 cegprakash: ouch
 BenWo: yeah, finally got there though
 BenWo: turns out I was accidentally setting 2 nodes to be each-other's parent node :unamused:
 cegprakash: lolol
 cegprakash: 10/10 wins after fixing that collisoin bug
 cegprakash: caliberated at rank 35
 BenWo: niiice
 cegprakash: this is the chance!
 cegprakash: 12/12 win
 cegprakash: go go go
 NinjaDoggy: see you in legend!
 cegprakash: 13/13
 cegprakash: now plz nobody in gold submit and take away my rank lol
 <b>**seronis submits</b></p><p><img src="/a/42969361718367" /> seronis: *in a completely diff puzzle
 BenWo: hah
 NinjaDoggy: cegprakash you have &gt;50 against boos right
 NinjaDoggy: boss*
 <b>**BenWo submits. In silver.</b></p><p><img src="/a/5338452207730" /> NinjaDoggy: don't push it higher pelase
 cegprakash: boss is a crap
 cegprakash: he is there lucky
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 cegprakash: coz he is not facing the bottom guys
 NinjaDoggy: it's so true
 NinjaDoggy: if boss was resubmitted
 NinjaDoggy: it'd be rank like 50
 cegprakash: so I only test against #2
 NinjaDoggy: but testing against boss is relaly good though
 NinjaDoggy: if you have like 80% WR against boss you can drag it down each submit
 NinjaDoggy: :P
 cegprakash: sometimes I climb so well and someone at bottom submit and if it's a loss then I drop big
 AntiSquid: interesting, boss is crap&#160;?
 BenWo: yeah you'll get legend cegprakash
 cegprakash: I better
 BenWo: you're top 5 gold already
 cegprakash: I was #20 at gold when legend didn't even open
 cegprakash: look where I'm now&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: ya nothing you can do with this randomness
 seronis: well in a perfect world with infinite CPU cycles the server would just keep auto battling everyone against everyone they havent yet battled and ranks wouldnt be so random
 NinjaDoggy: well... i'm not sure that's the issue even
 NinjaDoggy: it's hard to assign ranks to bots
 NinjaDoggy: when A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A
 seronis: no. treat them no diff than a player.  thats the whole point of rank
 AntiSquid: it is but this system is horrible @_@
 NinjaDoggy: which often is the case
 AntiSquid: ceg F 
 cegprakash: AntiSquid add anti accident.. this way u reduce the randomness
 NinjaDoggy: anti accident is also anti optimal...
 cegprakash: once u caliberate well
 seronis: if you have fought everyone then you first just look at your total win/loss ratio and that becoems the score for beating you.  a 2nd pass sums score
 NinjaDoggy: depending on how safe you play it
 seronis: so cyclic wins like RPS have no factor
 cegprakash: NinjaDoggy I've a buffer for controlling anti accident
 AntiSquid: looks like you might need to resubmit multiple times ceg
 NinjaDoggy: ok yea nvm you're right
 NinjaDoggy: round robin would fix it
 NinjaDoggy: but...
 NinjaDoggy: it would also incentivize beating bad bots?
 cegprakash: Okay I shuffled the top 10 drastically
 NinjaDoggy: as opposed to beating other top bots?
 cegprakash: rank 2 guy is now rank 9
 seronis: no.   because 1 top bot with a high win/loss ratio is still more points for that one win
 AntiSquid: i rather have tourney bracket than this mess :D
 cegprakash: as I kept testing against rank 2 he dropped to rank 9
 NinjaDoggy: ok no, tourney bracket would be horrible
 AntiSquid: (tourney bracket is a mess)
 NinjaDoggy: then the RPS would suck&#160;:(
 MattSOrme: ooh, almost there. come on!! 3 more places!
 NinjaDoggy: imagine being the overall best bot, but you get seeded against your counter
 AntiSquid: what are you struggling to achieve MattSOrme
 MattSOrme: gold
 AntiSquid: NinjaDoggy that's basically this contest
 MattSOrme: just need a couple more people to challenge me and lose. Don't wanna risk a resubmit
 cegprakash: I have a 0-5 against Psyho
 cegprakash: and 2-1 against boss
 NinjaDoggy: true... but it would make matters worse
 NinjaDoggy: wait you've been testing locally vs psyho and u'r 0-5 against him?
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: I was testing against Mickah
 NinjaDoggy: ok just submit like 3 more times, bump him into legend and then u can go after
 MarekM: day ago, I was  9th gold... after day of coding, at best 187th gold
 NinjaDoggy: ezpz
 cegprakash: I dropped him to #8
 NinjaDoggy: resubmit 3 times, bump psyho and then go to legend once he's out of the way
 AntiSquid: so you optimized vs #2 well done
 NinjaDoggy: poor michah...
 NinjaDoggy: what did s/he do to deserve this
 AntiSquid: just optimize vs psyho, drop him and then optimize vs michah again
 NinjaDoggy: nonono
 NinjaDoggy: that's too much work
 NinjaDoggy: just bump him to legend
 NinjaDoggy: and then optimize against boss
 NinjaDoggy: drop boss to like 26
 NinjaDoggy: and then ezpz legend urself
 AntiSquid: i just find it funny he didn't optimize vs boss
 AntiSquid: he might have promoted
 AntiSquid: was being sarcastic with the optimize vs #2
 cegprakash: u never get games against boss 
 NinjaDoggy: yeh that's kinda true
 cegprakash: what's the point in optimizing against him
 NinjaDoggy: # games vs boss is too low&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: like i've had contests where i had like 80% WR against boss
 NinjaDoggy: i submit, get 3 games
 NinjaDoggy: and go 2-1
 AntiSquid: cg scared of mass promotion
 NinjaDoggy: and don't do anything&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: but not scared of bottleneck
 NinjaDoggy: better sacrafice a few good bots
 NinjaDoggy: than let a whole herd of bad bots into legend
 NinjaDoggy: i guess&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: and sure no bottom legend bots got lucky promotions right
 cegprakash: 3-2 against boss.. give me more taste of the boss
 AntiSquid: surely*
 cegprakash: oh no not psyho
 cegprakash: 0-7 against psyho
 AntiSquid: 3-2&#160;? sounds like you can barely beat it
 cegprakash: damn
 cegprakash: lol just gimme more games against boss
 AntiSquid: 3-2 can be luck honestly
 cegprakash: I am beating psyho on IDE 
 cegprakash: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 AntiSquid: black magic
 AntiSquid: maybe leave bot where it is and go improve if you don't promote
 cegprakash: 2-7 against psyho
 cegprakash: and I'm #2
 cegprakash: I will not do the same mistake of resubmitting
 MattSOrme: i'm like joint 2nd in my league. Just need that last little bump
 cegprakash: 96% #2
 cegprakash: it's like watching the last over of a t20 match
 cegprakash: just don't give me psyho&#160;:(
 cegprakash: gimme the boss
 cegprakash: 0.06 behind the boss
 cegprakash: hoping ppl will push me
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: time to eat some food
 BenWo: good idea, stop watching&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: lol i helped
 AntiSquid: just beat boss for you
 AntiSquid: cegprakash i won vs boss, you promoted
 BenWo: lol nice
 cegprakash: One does not simply level up on Codingame. Oh wait... I totally did! 
 cegprakash: thank you &lt;3
 cegprakash: I'm getting totally rekt on legend
 cegprakash: 3 wins in 13
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: so the last thing I added to my 3 day old code is anti accident
 cegprakash: :D
 MattSOrme: is no one testing silver?? come on people, bump me plz
 AntiSquid: wtf is anti accident
 cegprakash: once u see enemy
 cegprakash: u know where he is
 cegprakash: if he is not in ur vision
 cegprakash: u know his previous position and his previous turn
 cegprakash: u also know ur current turn
 cegprakash: so with these info u can avoid accidents
 cegprakash: AntiSquid
 Zenoscave: ceg do you do it probabilistically?
 cegprakash: no probability
 seronis: but you wont know where all of them are which means you have unknowns that cant be tracked so its pointless
 cegprakash: just turn difference
 Zenoscave: or just avoid any "possible" places
 AntiSquid: someone promoted psyho
 cegprakash: also at turn 0 u can mirror ur own position to enemy
 AntiSquid: or beat boss, whichever
 cegprakash: usually when u promote to a league u would expect to be at 70% rank
 cegprakash: but I'm 77/78
 cegprakash: :D
 MarekM: gratz!
 seronis: why 70%?  id have guessed 95%
 cegprakash: I was #30 gold out off 200 when I got promoted out off silver
 seronis: that seems like the exception and implies you made a great improvement instead of minor one
 AntiSquid: it's not an exception
 AntiSquid: it's very common that once you promote you go past 50% of the next league
 AntiSquid: the division doesn't really make much sense as it is
 BenWo: they would have to demote for bad performance to keep it making sense that way
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: we need a demote boss then
 cegprakash: :D
 BenWo: well, if the demoted people then faced the lower league boss they would probably drag it down
 AntiSquid: or just drop the bosses . top 15 are legend, next 20% or so gold, rest top 50&#160;% silver, rest bronze ... done 
 BenWo: yeah that's an option, it also uses demotion
 AntiSquid: and submits you only first within 100 rank range
 AntiSquid: fight *
 MattSOrme: ugh, i hate testing against players that don't play the same
 cegprakash: the real contest actually happens in legend. all other leagues are just to build some hacky code to beat the top 2,3 bots and spam submits until u get calibrate to face them
 EvModder: or instead of spam submit just sleep on it lol
 seronis: sounds like bad balance.  by silver that should be the situation
 EvModder: that's the balance that comes from the players, not the system i think
 AntiSquid: you can't lose if you don't participate
 Xlos: moving twice in one turn makes things complex
 Xlos: sometimes it seems it would be better to move 1 to access the situation
 EvModder: a lot of people don't put in the time to make something really competitive from what i can tell
 AntiSquid: that's true
 EvModder: i've already spent at least 10 hours on this game, and will probably do another 4-8 over the next day
 cegprakash: Xlos right
 cegprakash: u can have if else for that or even a sim to decide it
 Xlos: kind of a nontrivial if else man
 cegprakash: then do a scoring based on board state
 seronis: the system itself would have been better to just have 'speed turns' that occur where only speeded players react
 seronis: and you always properly analize each turn
 BenWo: that would have been really nice
 seronis: its how it works in the backend.  the turn counter going above 200 verifies that
 BenWo: yeah, it would have to in order to path around corners
 BenWo: finally seeing results from my pathing rewrite
 cegprakash: seronis if u bring that a pellet can disappear suddenly when u are watching it
 cegprakash: opponent would have been hidden previous turn and he would have snatched it and went  back hiding
 BenWo: lol ninja pac
 cegprakash: yeah and that's not nice
 seronis: not at all.  a speed turn just ignores any order you give non speeded pacs
 seronis: and works identical every other way
 cegprakash: you don't understand what I'm saying seronis read again
 cegprakash: now u can't do UP followed by a DOWN
 seronis: whic you SHOULD be able to do
 cegprakash: but if u ask it ur way u can do UP followed by a DOWN
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: and that's a drawback
 cegprakash: because a pellet can disappear while u are watching it
 Zandy156: he wants to read the input in between though 
 cegprakash: wait what
 BenWo: a pellet could disappear while watching it now though
 cegprakash: mm
 seronis: what im suggesting prevents magic disappearance
 BenWo: if a speed pac goes across your path
 cegprakash: the purpose of speed is ruined
 seronis: a while() loop should occur during speed turns is what i saying instead of how it currently skips that while loop
 seronis: the purpose of speed is to get 2 moves, not be stealthy
 seronis: the only thing speed turns should have done was ignore input from not speeded pacs
 cegprakash: that way simming would be too easy
 cegprakash: ofcourse
 cegprakash: codingame loves challenge
 cegprakash: now u have to do lot of collision calculations on same turn voila 
 seronis: i love challenges.. i dont like flawed systems.  different apples
 cegprakash: this is flawed system?
 cegprakash: lol
 seronis: a speeded pac cant make a uturn.  no reason to prevent that.   yes its a flaw
 cegprakash: that's L turn
 cegprakash: not a U turn
 cegprakash: u need 3 moves for U turn
 cegprakash: or 4
 Icebox: he's talkint about LR
 seronis: no.  you move to a cell and then move immediately back
 Icebox: or UD
 Icebox: and yet, just cause you don't like a design choice, doesn't make it a flaw
 cegprakash: exactly
 cegprakash: what will u achieve with an U turn?
 seronis: moving into an intersection, gaining line of sight,  making new decisions
 MattSOrme: it would speed up getting dead ends
 seronis: or grabbing a pellet at a dead end
 MattSOrme: line of sight wouldn't work cos you don't get info
 seronis: basically making decisions at every step,  instead of making a decision then going retarded for a turn
 cegprakash: if u have been following last 3 contests there is a trend going on in Codingame with hidden information
 cegprakash: this one is very less compared to Ocean of Code
 Icebox: or planning your movements far enough ahead that you don't waste a move with speed 2 on a dead end
 seronis: never heard of this site till 2 weeks ago so no,  no prior challenges
 seronis: and line of sight would work if speed turns were real turns
 cegprakash: seronis in legend I do 20 turns prediction that's like 40 turns prior prediction
 Icebox: as I said, if your bot wastes its 2nd move on a dead end and you don't end up using your speed boost to the full potential...
 MattSOrme: oh come on. Rank 2. Just waiting for the promotion. Not submitting shit till it happens
 cegprakash: if u want it ur way, then I would go even 60 depth
 Icebox: then maybe the problem is your bot and not the design "flaw"
 Xlos: Anyone know any master/gold players that use a killing strategy?
 Xlos: All the ones I view are fairly vanilla
 cegprakash: MattSOrme which league?
 MattSOrme: silver
 cegprakash: if Bronze don't resubmit
 seronis: curious why wouldnt bronze resubmit?   I dont understand why that would be relevant
 Icebox: because there are enough people to push him up or boss down
 Icebox: the bigger the league, the more people submitting, the more movement in rankings
 seronis: ah gotcha
 seronis: ty
 cegprakash: when legend Icebox
 Icebox: stopped working on my bot on friday
 cegprakash: just add anti accidents and path finding
 cegprakash: I am assuming u already have path finding
 cegprakash: so just add anti accident
 Icebox: I think you missed my message above :D
 cegprakash: u never said u will not start again
 Icebox: meh
 Icebox: I guess I could
 MattSOrme: damn. kktus messed me up&#160;:(
 Kktus: =p
 MattSOrme: was pretty much 50/50 on matches, but knocked me down
 Kktus: i fixed a bug on last submit
 Kktus: but nice AI, i was struggling with you too =)
 Kktus: (see you soon in gold)
 MattSOrme: im praying ha
 MattSOrme: Want to get knocked up by others though instead of risk a new submission. But im still working on it
 MattSOrme: when i first submitted it landed me in 14th, and i've drifted up to 2nd from there :D
 Kktus: nice
 Kktus: i think if you wait a little you will pass the boss
 Kktus: but you can also develop a new feature of you bot and pass gold quicker
 MattSOrme: i'll submit again if im still not gold before i give up adn go to bed
 Kktus: See you tomorrow&#160;!
 MattSOrme: Aight, screw it. Its late and im tired. no ones gonna push me up, so gontta re-submit
 MattSOrme: bye second place&#160;:'(
 thethiny: it's weird how sometimes I time out, then I hit replay and it works
 BenWo: yep that's weird
 BenWo: what does your turn timing come out to usually?
 Exa65536: Anyone know what the maximum memory usage is?
 thethiny: @BenWo no clue it just doesn't work
 BenWo: what about when it works?
 thethiny: works fine no issues
 thethiny: it only times out at frame 1
 BenWo: ah ok
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466007681">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466007681</a>

 thethiny: and here it doesn't time out
 BenWo: you'll probably have to put in a lot of print statements to figure out
 thethiny: the first print isn't even working
 thethiny: which says width x height
 thethiny: I think it's timing out on the imports
 AshKetchum: thethiny get the referee seed from game parameters in the first replay, and paste it in options to test it
 thethiny: it is the same seed
 thethiny: seed=198905106014823712
 thethiny: I just hit replay and it works
 BenjaminUrquhart: I know where the issues in my code are, but I'm not motivated to fix them properly
 BenjaminUrquhart: send help
 BenWo: :blowfish:
 thethiny: "name old_road" not defined
 thethiny: Less music and more coding please
 thethiny:&#160;:(
 thethiny: I fixed the error and now I'm losing to clyde :D
 thethiny: damn man it's a tue
 thethiny: tie
 BenWo: ooh more music and more coding please
 BenWo: I forgot to put my music on 
 Braykin08: Rookie mistake
 Zandy156: I just realized an important part of my code does nothing. 
 Zandy156: gotta love python
 thethiny: I had an attack mode going on 
 thethiny: but it's not working 
 thethiny: like not activating
 thethiny: turns out I forgot to call the function :D
 BenWo: haha
 BenWo: well that's an easy improvement
 JohnCM: haha you might realize if you attack you might perform poorer
 JohnCM: i turned off my attack after a few tries XD
 BenWo: it's certainly situational
 Exa65536: Dangit. None of my losses (timeout or otherwise) reproduce when I tell it to re-run them in the IDE.
 Exa65536: so I can't see what's going on and try tweaking things
 wi_lius: @Exa do you generate random numbers in your code?
 Exa65536: no, my code is deterministic (aside from timing). Is there a way to get cerr output for the last ply? It looks like I can get the cerr for all the moves except the one where I actually timed out.

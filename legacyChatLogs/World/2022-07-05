 TheWaterCooledComet_63c: no bicsiz?
 Aldoggen: there is also a french chat if you speak that
 derjack: Automaton2000 those are your last days, arent they
 Automaton2000: need to check if you have a few more
 Aldoggen: savage response if you ask me
 DoubleCube_568c: enschuldigung ich kann nicht sprecht English
 SugarCoatedPencilCase_8462: nincs szuka

 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 do you believe these people can't speak english?
 Automaton2000: understandable, have a nice day

 JFB: Funny, 1st time I have been promoted to Legend with bot doing sometimes (and rather often) forbidden moves&#160;:-) 
 Aldoggen: in green circle?
 JFB: Exactly&#160;:-)
 Aldoggen: they chose the wrong boss
 Aldoggen: for more than one league probably
 Aldoggen: so now everyone and their mother is in legend
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 JFB: It is only 192 bots in legend now - so around 10% of participants
 Aldoggen: figure of speach&#160;:)
 derjack: speek
 BlaiseEbuth: oO
 JFB: But you are right - if bot not checking do move is valid or not can be promoted ...&#160;;-
 derjack: they brought back mirror matches? :tada:

 xx_holly: sorry we are just clashing hard
 xx_zero: sorry
 xx_holly: you don't tell noob master off, just cause i'm a women in STEM
 5DN1L: spammers will get kicked or banned, you guys have been warned
 xx_holly: we were literally in the middle of a clash
 5DN1L: just don't spam here, whatever you do
 xx_holly: okay:thumbsup: i'm still going to slay in my clash
 5DN1L: thanks
 Westicles: is it necessary to define gcd for a clash, or is that common knowledge?
 derjack: great circle distance?
 5DN1L: green circle debt
 Smai: You crack me up 5DN1L :rofl:
 5DN1L: oh heehee, that's unexpected
 5DN1L: hmmm, I don't think it's necessary to define greatest common divisor as the full name has been given. it's pretty self-explanatory
 Westicles: yeah, that's what I thought
 derjack: youll know it when see the number of 1-starts
 derjack: stars even
 Westicles: I wish they showed stars for clashes, you don't get feedback unless it is removed
 j4at: Well, they are busy removing the chat :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: A lot of precautions are needed to avoid deleting the whole website and the database with it.

 tevaaa: Hey do someone know hot the general ranking of clash works&#160;?
 tevaaa: like is speed more important tham having 100%
 Razovsky: no
 5DN1L: tevaaa different modes rank differently
 Aldoggen: it depends on what mode you're playing, but accuracy is generally the most important stat
 5DN1L: for fastest and reverse: pass&#160;% &gt; time
 Razovsky: for speed CoC, the evaluation is on score and time, but if u do 0% faster, ull be better than longer 0% but below slower 1%
 5DN1L: for shortest: pass&#160;% &gt; number of chars &gt; time
 Aldoggen: what 5DN1L said
 Pinguin6454: xD
 5DN1L: wanna say something, Pinguin6454&#160;?
 JASSIEL: hello world
 Pinguin6454: nah i'm just quiet
 Pinguin6454: and i understand 0% of the conversation on top
 JASSIEL: i'm a just novice who can help me&#160;???
 5DN1L: so what are you going to do on this website? Pinguin6454
 5DN1L: JASSIEL help you with what
 Pinguin6454: 5DN1L i am lerning
 Darleanow: Hey 5DN1L&#160;:))
 5DN1L: Hi Darleanow
 Darleanow: how are u fam&#160;?
 5DN1L: good thanks, and you?
 Darleanow: i'm good too
 5DN1L: Pinguin6454 Are you trying out any puzzle right now?
 Darleanow: my brain feels lighter&#160;:)
 5DN1L: good to hear that Darleanow
 Pinguin6454: jezz
 5DN1L: what do you mean
 Darleanow: (i think all i needed was to meet back old friends)
 Pinguin6454: jes  im trying a one right now
 Pinguin6454: 5DN1L
 5DN1L: that's cool
 Pinguin6454: naah how i said i am TRYING
 Darleanow: xDDD
 Darleanow: which one is it pinguin?
 Pinguin6454: dont jugde me
 Pinguin6454: The Descent i think
 5DN1L: trying is better than copying answers without understanding it
 Darleanow: i've started from nothing too
 Pinguin6454: i am at the one with the space ship trying to land and destroying some thinks
 Darleanow: okay, remember u need to get the biggest value from the input you are given&#160;:)
 Darleanow: in the order (so it starts from mountain_0)
 Darleanow: the hardest there is to get the logic when u start
 Darleanow: coding isn't this hard for some puzzle, the struggle is the logic
 Darleanow: you can even write it down on a paper
 Darleanow: (i'm doing this a lot and it helps)
 Pinguin6454: jea i have a paper beside me and i use it but i zhink i am to stupid xDDD
 Darleanow: don't say this&#160;!
 Pinguin6454: xDD
 Pinguin6454: :laughing:
 Pinguin6454: ok i am in a internship and have to use C# xD
 5DN1L: so you have previous programming experience right?
 5DN1L: Codingame is not your first coding experience
 Pinguin6454: it is xDD
 5DN1L: oh
 Pinguin6454: xD 
 5DN1L: if you have never learned any programming before, you may find it difficult to solve the puzzles here
 5DN1L: this website assumes that you've learned some basics already
 Pinguin6454: jea i am here to lern this but my "teacher" does only know these methode
 5DN1L: you can't learn basics here, this is not a tutorial website
 5DN1L: maybe you can, but it's difficult
 5DN1L: you need more effort to research things on your own
 Darleanow: i've learned there 5DN1L
 Darleanow: don't say it's hard, because it's just a pain in the ass
 Darleanow: i'd recommend you to play clashes
 5DN1L: you need to google a lot to know the syntax
 Darleanow: use google while clashing
 Darleanow: indeed, for whatever you need
 Pinguin6454: jea this is what i thougt but what can i do exept for googl and tutorials
 Darleanow: sometimes i'm doing stupid google query's for basic things i've forgotten
 5DN1L: some coding websites are specialised in teaching syntax
 Aldoggen: I do that constantly
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>
 Darleanow: spam this
 Darleanow: believe me
 Pinguin6454: i would rather work with java
 Darleanow: it's from there that i've learned the msot
 Aldoggen: don't
 Darleanow: and google
 Aldoggen: if you don't have the basics, 15 minutes is not a lot
 Darleanow: he can use google
 Darleanow: ofc he won't finish the 20-30 first ones
 Darleanow: or maybe he will
 Darleanow: but he will leanr
 Darleanow: anything
 Aldoggen: well I guess it's a start
 5DN1L: yeah, it depends on whether Pinguin6454 likes that approach of learning
 Darleanow: also he can watch solution from the ones who did it 
 Darleanow: that's just my opinion afterall 
 Aldoggen: Pinguin6454 java and C# are pretty similar, so it doesn't matter too much which one you choose
 Aldoggen: watch solution is a good way to learn indeed
 Aldoggen: as long as it's used in the right way
 Aldoggen: don't try to memorize the solutions, only memorize the language
 Darleanow: well said&#160;!
 j4at: c# &gt; java
 j4at:&#160;:)
 Pinguin6454: jea i try thanks for the tips
 Aldoggen: I don't like how C# was originally windows-only
 Pinguin6454: :thumbsup:
 StevenV: oh
 Pinguin6454: ohh
 Pinguin6454: Siuuueeee
 Aldoggen: yesterday I saw a new multi in the makings that would be added: rock paper scissors. the guy did it as a joke, but the community response was overwhelmingly positive. anyone knows what happened to that multi
 Aldoggen:&#160;?*
 struct: I don't think it will become a multi
 darkhorse64: and I hope it will stay as a WIP
 StevenV: too many legend
 Aldoggen: too many legend?
 StevenV: for greencircle
 Aldoggen: was talking about rock paper scissors :p
 StevenV: np, I will soon get to legend :D
 Pinguin6454: letz play rock paper scissord
 Pinguin6454: rock 
 Arrrthur: scissors

 Sakenz: hi
 eulerscheZahl: struct  03:08ᴾᴹI don't think it will become a multidarkhorse64 03:09ᴾᴹand I hope it will stay as a WIP
 eulerscheZahl: you must be talking abo troll vs castle
 struct: rock paper scissor 
 eulerscheZahl: i know :P
 j4at: rock paper scissor, Finally a game that I can do good at&#160;:)
 struct: less random than green circle&#160;:)
 struct: I'm joking, I think the top bots prove that green circle is not that random
 j4at: It should really get accepted
 derjack: right after tvc
 struct: yeah the contribution probably had a lot of time invested on it
 struct: and it would be a quality multi
 Astrobytes: Add fog. You never know what your opponent drew until the end of the game when the scores are revealed.
 Aldoggen: lol
 Aldoggen: then I'd just choose random moves
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Aldoggen: wouldn't be very interesting
 Aldoggen: made me chuckle tho
 struct: There is actual strategy
 Aldoggen: I'm assuming you're talking about the non-blind version?
 Astrobytes: I know I know, it was a joke
 Aldoggen: no I mean struck
 Aldoggen: struct*
 struct: ah the fog one
 Astrobytes: I was responding to struct :P
 struct: if you dont know the score sure
 struct: its just random
 Aldoggen: if you do know the score, you might as well know what the opponent played
 j4at: NN for rock paper scissors LMAO
 Astrobytes: isn't the strategy something to do with the frequency of whatever move your opponent makes?
 Aldoggen: j4at derjack posted this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dennylslee/rock-paper-scissors-LSTM/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/dennylslee/rock-paper-scissors-LSTM/blob/master/README.md</a>
 Astrobytes: I mean, it works with humans
 Aldoggen: Astrobytes not only the frequency
 Aldoggen: also what moves come after what 
 Astrobytes: yeah, paper after rock so play scissors etc
 Aldoggen: well yeah maybe it all comes down to frequencies
 Astrobytes: it's behavioural too
 Astrobytes: Human behaviour that is
 Astrobytes: Can't replicate that so well with a program 
 Aldoggen: I guess what it comes down to is: "given our previous moves, what is the chance opponent will play this?"
 Astrobytes: More or less I suppose
 Aldoggen: ideally, in an infinitely long rps game you'd write a neural network that tries to capture the behaviour of your opponent
 Astrobytes: Bunch of different opponents and shedloads of games I'd say
 Astrobytes: opponent 1 plays favouring one move in particular, 2 plays random, 3 tries to counter etc etc
 Astrobytes: thereafter, self-train until sentient enough that it gives up on that silly game
 Astrobytes: :P
 Aldoggen: lol&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: 5DN1L, I did the onboarding puzzle with some kind of NN
 5DN1L: that's really quick :open_mouth:
 Aldoggen: well
 Aldoggen: I think I did at least
 Aldoggen: nn has 3 nodes 
 Aldoggen: I'd count that :p
 5DN1L: does it pass the test case all the time?
 Aldoggen: sometimes it fails
 Aldoggen: most of the time it passes
 Aldoggen: it's because I initialize it and let it learn during the puzzle
 Aldoggen: not a very standard approach, cut since this is such a simple problem, I figured it should be possible
 5DN1L: during the puzzle :thinking: there are so few turns
 Aldoggen: yep
 Aldoggen: I had to make the learning rate decay in the right way
 Aldoggen: and I wen from linear activation function to bounded linear
 5DN1L: Forum post: You can check out my Onboarding solution 458 in C++ which uses a NN to do the min over the two distances, although the code doesn’t include the learning part of the NN.
 5DN1L: ^ That approach is different from yours
 5DN1L: oops 458 is the number of views
 Astrobytes: that Agades one?
 5DN1L: yes
 Aldoggen: is there a way in which I can share a link to my code?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, hardcoded the weights iirc, there are a few others too but I'm not sure what they did
 5DN1L: is it published on CG? Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: it's published now
 Aldoggen: I clicked the button at least
 Aldoggen: it's java
 Aldoggen: I really wonder if I did it right lol
 Aldoggen: well, it works, so it's right in some way
 derjack: NNs are forgiving in some ways
 Aldoggen: the onboarding puzzle is forgiving too
 5DN1L: Hmmm I can't find your code
 5DN1L: but you should be able to get the link to your solution and share here
 Astrobytes: or pastebin it
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding/solution">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding/solution</a>
 5DN1L: go to this link then click your solution
 5DN1L: you should get the link
 5DN1L: should be able to*
 derjack: i followed him and see the code
 Aldoggen: aah, maybe that's it
 Aldoggen: when I click on my solution, I don't have a way to share it though
 5DN1L: you just copy the link from the url bar
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding/solution?id=25373384">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding/solution?id=25373384</a>
 5DN1L: yes that
 Aldoggen: oh wow
 Aldoggen: I was looking for something on the website itself
 Aldoggen: didn't realize the url changed
 Aldoggen: ty derjack
 derjack: SLP eh
 Aldoggen: slp?
 Aldoggen: slowpoke? yep
 derjack: single layer perceptron eh
 Aldoggen: uhuh
 Aldoggen: it doesn't need more than that
 Aldoggen: I got all the terminology straight from wikipedia
 derjack: and i dont know what the code does oO
 Aldoggen: I can walk you through it lol
 Aldoggen: there's a NN class, which is basically a container and wrapper for the nodes
 Aldoggen: the nodes store what nodes lead to them, together with the weights
 derjack: whats the point of sources an d hashmap
 Aldoggen: what I just said
 Aldoggen: so a node that's not an input node can get its value via that hashmap
 Aldoggen: the implementation is a bit suboptimal, since all values are recalculated all the time
 Aldoggen: but since there's only one output node, it doesn't matter
 Aldoggen: so NN gets the value of the output node, and returns if it's bigger than 0.
 Aldoggen: and that's how we decide what enemy to shoot
 5DN1L: wow this contribution <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/235798e04ab0d85662e83a8333f5272f9bcbf">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/235798e04ab0d85662e83a8333f5272f9bcbf</a>

 Razerk: Hi there&#160;! Is about to be lucky or not to complete the Mad Pod Racing  (collision step)&#160;? I put a slow before the checkpoint but sometimes the other car just pushes me away and then win
 MatteoS: hi
 Aldoggen: Razerk sometimes it's luck, sometimes you can do something about it. it's generally a pretty hard problem
 Aldoggen: see if you can come up with something&#160;:)
 Razerk: It's bronze league btw..
 Aldoggen: I got to gold by mostly ignoring the enemy and just being faster. that's a strategy too I guess
 Aldoggen: though I don't think I can get much higher without doing something about the enemy
 Razerk: But the MOSt annoying thing here is this following one&#160;: I need to wait so much time to face the "BOSS"
 Aldoggen: you click "play my code" and there's a wait time before the video plays? 
 Aldoggen: that's because the server needs to calculate how the battle goes
 Razerk: Nah the video tells me to go into the area mode
 Aldoggen: okay, what exactly is going slow?
 Razerk: i do have a rank against others players
 Razerk: and I start at about 40.000 and i have to go to rank 1
 Aldoggen: yes
 Razerk: A race is about 30 secs and i have to win like 15/20 races
 Razerk: i guess
 Aldoggen: the idea is that if you're not better than the other players, you're probably not better than the boss
 Razerk: Yeah but it's so random
 Razerk: If i find a code which works
 Razerk: i'll go face the boss quickly?
 Astrobytes: if your bot is good enough, it will take less time to rise in ranking because it will beat the others
 Aldoggen: it's a bit random yeah, but there are lots of things you can try that will improve you
 Aldoggen: and what astro said
 Razerk: yeh make sens but .. random there
 Aldoggen: if you're better, it's mostly not random
 Razerk: Well I'll try to think otherwise
 Aldoggen: good luck&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: If your bot is good enough, the randomness will go away
 Aldoggen: that's a better way of putting it lol
 Astrobytes: yes, what Aldoggen said :D
 Razerk: Well 
 Astrobytes: lol, nah, 6 and half a dozen I'd say
 Aldoggen: the randomness is a symptom of the fact that you're as good as the people around your rank
 5DN1L: better than consistently lose :upside_down:
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:
 Aldoggen: )
 5DN1L: ^ a split face
 Aldoggen: it hurts
 Astrobytes: yeah, if it sits at the bottom and loses score you know It Is Very Bad
 Razerk: I should work on the slow by example?
 MatteoS: fock
 5DN1L: MatteoS there is no fork, and there is no spoon
 Aldoggen: only knives, the others went too soon
 Astrobytes: can't just come in here dropping fock bombs, sort it out :P
 Razerk: too spoon* you mean
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 5DN1L: lol
 MatteoS: :joy:
 Aldoggen: lol

 struct: or w/e its called
 eulerscheZahl: 5DN1L edited my forum post from 6 years ago :shocked:
 5DN1L: only because somebody replied to it recently&#160;:)
 MSmits: struct I think you just have your NN's play games against eachother and use the gamestates  encountered in the game, as targets to train
 MSmits: the labels are the values from the search
 eulerscheZahl: i followed the title convention used at that time
 eulerscheZahl: about the URL: right, should have added it
 MSmits: because the values are gotten from many lookups and averaged, they tend to be better than a single lookup
 MSmits: lookup being a nn.forward
 MSmits: so you train your nn to output the value it would output after searching a tree
 5DN1L: eulerscheZahl I have no idea about previous convention
 MSmits: please correct me jacek
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, let's do it the way the community bot does now
 eulerscheZahl: all good
 struct: so if gamestate has value of lets say 0.7
 struct: the NN forward should match it?
 jacek: msmits eeyup
 eulerscheZahl: was just surprised to see an edit in my notifications
 MSmits: that would be the label yes struct
 struct: but how would I give a value to a gamestate?
 5DN1L:  eulerscheZahl :ok_hand_tone1:
 j4at: tensorflow keras is the best library to use according to contests winners stats. But Pytorch is better for research because lower level, and easier to implement more advanced algorithms. But for CG tf keras is probably better. jacek
 MSmits: you run a mcts with EPT and do a forward from your NN every time
 MSmits: like you would do with a normal mcts with EPT, except instead of eval it's a NN forward
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/images/8/88/MeepStraps.jpg">https://www.chessprogramming.org/images/8/88/MeepStraps.jpg</a>
 MSmits: or think of it as replacing random rollout with a nn forward
 jacek: V(position at root) -&gt; V(leaf)
 MSmits: you backpropagate the result just as you would in any mcts
 MSmits: the reason this works is because you know the value of endgames
 struct: But wouldnt the value of the gamestate change?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but not near endgames
 MSmits: so your nn learns endgames first
 struct: I see I go backwards
 MSmits: and then progressively becomes better at earlier games
 jacek: at first i was using 4-ply minimax search as targets for bt nn, before switch to mcts thingy
 MSmits: yes that works too, or one of those gargantuan meta mcts databases of mine
 struct: So for example if the game ends in 6 plys as win
 struct: the eval shouldnt be 1 should it?
 MSmits: if it's a guaranteed win that would be fine
 jacek: yes. (if you used tanh)
 MSmits: if it's not guaranteed and it still outputs 1, it will eventually learn not to do so
 putibuzu: you can also use the game result as target, i.e. label all states with +1,-1,0. this is how alphazero does it
 MSmits: you'd be assuming your NN already plays perfectly
 MSmits: but i guess it can converge
 putibuzu: then with many learning games the NN will learn the avg of a position (given proper sampling)
 MSmits: jacek did you ever try comparing this with your way?
 MSmits: I think the problem may be that azero also has policy. It may not work without policy
 jacek: using endgame results it was worse, but noy by far
 MSmits: ah ok
 putibuzu: true, the policy helps a lot ultimately
 Aldoggen: I guess more immediate feedback would lead to better results, but I don't know anythin about this
 MSmits: well it's always the problem with these games, knowing the end result doesnt tell you when the mistake was made
 jacek: the target thingy seems counterintuitive. you converge at first into random NN predictions
 jacek: but overtime the real values from the game dominate
 Aldoggen: lol imagine losing a chess game and your mentor tells you "somewhere in this game you made a mistake. good luck next time"
 MSmits: heh yes
 putibuzu: here they compared the methods: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628">https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628</a>they concluded that starting out with the game result and then transition to the avg value the longer the training goes learns best
 putibuzu: *learns fastest
 Aldoggen: I guess you don't get that stage where you're converging into random NN predictions, as jacek said
 MSmits: jacek I can see a potential for more hyperparameters for you
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 putibuzu: :D
 struct: I need policy?
 MSmits: stuct no
 struct: good
 MSmits: dont make it more difficult than you need to, value works fine
 struct: I have no idea how I could code a policy for BT
 MSmits: you follow azero methodology
 MSmits: marchete shared
 jacek: there are about 170 possible moves in bt&#160;:?
 MSmits: but i wouldnt do it if it is your first or even one of your first 10 NN's
 putibuzu: what is BT? :D
 MSmits: breakthroug
 struct: breakthrough
 MSmits: +h
 struct: only 170 jacek?
 MSmits: i was faster because i left off the h
 putibuzu: ah alright thanks! 
 Aldoggen: game can last 209 moves is what I read
 MSmits: if you suck
 struct: thats different
 Aldoggen: yeah, but I think there's a link between the numbers
 struct: ok 168 moves
 struct: max
 struct: but can be changed to -24
 struct: so 144
 isimkullanmiyorum: hi , everyone from türkiye ,ecole 42
 MSmits: how so many?
 MSmits: you have like 16 pawns
 jacek: -24?
 MSmits: *3 
 MSmits: or am i missing something
 jacek: MSmits all possible moves across all games
 struct: you dont need to have moves on 7th row
 MSmits: ohh ok
 struct: if you are on 7th row and can move you won
 struct: so 24*6
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: when people say how many moves, i am thinking about the maximum branching factor
 MSmits: which is a totally different think
 MSmits: thing
 struct: max moves should be 48
 jacek: " (With a player point-of-view representation, there are atotal of 154 possible moves, according to start square and destination squareplus a no-move position if the game is over.)"
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: not sure if its possible
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321991759_Machine_Learning_in_the_Game_of_Breakthrough">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321991759_Machine_Learning_in_the_Game_of_Breakthrough</a>
 struct: let me do the math again
 jacek: im not sure what they mean with no-move
 struct: maybe the 24 is a number I have for other thing
 Aldoggen: a move that signifies the game is over?
 MSmits: the edges can only do 2  moves
 struct: 22
 MSmits: so it's 22 * 6
 struct: yeah
 struct: 22*7 = 154 so it matches jacek number
 Aldoggen: 7 for the back rank
 struct: useless to have imo
 MSmits: it's stupid to include the last row, like you said
 MSmits: dont make your nn more complicated than it needs to be
 Aldoggen: wait no, it only takes 6 moves to go from back rank to 7th
 Aldoggen: and if you're on 7th, any move is good
 MSmits: thats what we are saying
 Aldoggen: so you could get away with 5*22
 MSmits: no, i dont think so
 struct: nope
 MSmits: 1,2,3,4,5,6 all need moves, 7 does not
 struct: you can make moves from 6th row and still lose
 Aldoggen: aah, I misunderstood
 Aldoggen: I though you meant you didn't want to use your own back rank for some reason
 struct: ah no
 Aldoggen: yeah, I see now
 MSmits: i guess these guys from the paper want to teach their nn that if it moves from rank 7 it should output 1
 Aldoggen: that's unnecessary no?
 MSmits: it is
 Aldoggen: just wrap something around nn
 jacek: we will never know, the paper is paid&#160;:(
 MSmits: but i guess if you want a sort of general board game NN and you want to use as little of the rules as possible, you would include rank 7
 MSmits: Aldoggen you should read up on muzero
 MSmits: it doesn't even learn the game rules
 MSmits: it has an internal simulation that doesnt match the game
 Aldoggen: lol XD
 MSmits: you just give it the allowed actions and the results of its moves and it learns some kind of internal model of the game
 MSmits: but this model can include all sorts of illegal actions in intermediate steps as long as it doesnt actually play an illegal action
 jacek: good bot without game rules? thats impossible
 MSmits: it's not the same as your green circle bot though, muzero has a search tree of some sort
 MSmits: a search tree without a correct sim
 Aldoggen: sounds crazy&#160;:)
 jacek: its model-based, though model is learned
 MSmits: yeah, but it's not a 100% correct model, because the goal is not for it to be correct, but for it to lead to winning the game
 jacek: in model-free you can learn only 'instinct'. in model-full you can actually plan
 j4at: I will give breakthrough a try. recurse top 1 like always! What type of magic is he using :neutral_face:
 eulerscheZahl: neural network
 MSmits: he's not top 1 everywhere
 Aldoggen: is planning necessary? if your instinct is good enough, you wouldn't need planning
 eulerscheZahl: he's not first at coders of the realm 1v1&#160;:)
 MSmits: a 100% perfect nn is impossible, but with a search tree it can get much better
 jacek: nor in :notebook: :soccer:
 MSmits: that's what planning does
 Aldoggen: all right&#160;:)
 jacek: you can have crappy model but the search will mitigate the crappiness
 struct: for csb its easy
 struct: avx sim
 struct: create NN
 struct: rank 1
 MSmits: think of muzero like playing a soccer match. When you play soccer as a human you sort of have a model of the field and the movements of the ball, but it's not 100% correct even for the best players
 MSmits: muzero accepts this fact and makes the best of its internal model
 MSmits: azero cant do this
 jacek: j4at i was thinking to put the gpu to use
 MSmits: you should really use tensorflow then...
 jacek: but tensorflow prediction is so slow
 MSmits: it's only slow if you do a single 1
 MSmits: if you do a bunch at the same time it parallelizes nicely i think
 jacek: i would need to use very large batch
 Aldoggen: wow it's really made for parallellization then
 jacek: i mean i have simulation in c++, id need to somehow send stuff to python to calcuate and get the results back
 MSmits: yeah it is. you are not supposed to train NN's on a single thread
 MSmits: jacek, can't you gather a ton of data all at once and then train it?
 jacek: im talking about forward only for neuroevolution. i have many tiny NNs
 Aldoggen: I'm doing that in onboarding. training on a single thread :p
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: Aldoggen yeah it works fine for small projects
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: my first little NN
 MSmits: sounds like a xor NN
 struct: there is one NN on onboarding
 Aldoggen: now there's more than one
 Aldoggen: it's just max, not xor
 MSmits: yeah but i mean just as simple
 MSmits: make sure you use 4 hidden layers on it or something :P
 Aldoggen: it's way simpler than that
 Aldoggen: 2 inputs, one output
 MSmits: no hidden?
 j4at: lmao
 Aldoggen: no hidden
 MSmits: sad&#160;:(
 MSmits: i like hidden
 Aldoggen: it works most of the time, but it has a really small sample size to train on so
 j4at: with no hidden layers it can't even calculate xor
 MSmits: no this is not xor
 MSmits: he is doing max
 j4at: he is trying to predict the max of 2 numbers&#160;?
 MSmits: yes
 struct: pretty much
 MSmits: well no
 MSmits: he's predicting which is largest
 j4at: same shit 
 jacek: oO
 Aldoggen: exactly
 struct: I think this NN can be trained by hand
 Aldoggen: lol
 j4at: you can't do anything with no hidden layers
 Aldoggen: I set the weights by hand first
 MSmits: j4at you can in this case
 MSmits: he can just have all his weights set to 1
 Aldoggen: j4at this was just a test. i also knew what kind of NN was sufficient and used that
 j4at: oh, im dumb i though he meant return the max value
 Aldoggen: one to 1 and one to -1 does the trick perfectly
 j4at: not the index 
 Aldoggen: yeah, it just returns something that gets mapped to a boolean
 MSmits: i actually do this training by hand in one of my classes struct
 YBen1998: yo
 YBen1998: same i have to do drills in class lol
 YBen1998: firs ttime doing this 
 MSmits: i use the tensorflow playground by google and turn off everything except the x1, x2 input and then they have to set the weights manually
 MSmits: so that they get classified correctly
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: it's really easy
 Aldoggen: okay I wanna do that now
 struct: next class add 8 layers
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playground.tensorflow.org/">https://playground.tensorflow.org/</a>&#160;?
 j4at: Well, here they teach teach to train alphago by hand and get better accruacy
 j4at: teach us*
 MSmits: yes jacek
 MSmits: j4at sounds fun
 j4at: :upside_down:
 Rbinnetje: hello, I'm totally new to coding. Are there modes on this website where I can learn from scratch?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/9Hr0y3f">https://imgur.com/a/9Hr0y3f</a>
 MSmits: this is what it looks like after turning everything off
 MSmits: you can set the 2 weights
 5DN1L: Rbinnetje other than self-learning mode, not really
 MSmits: here i solved it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/qA3Xn8g">https://imgur.com/a/qA3Xn8g</a>
 jacek: MSmits now do the spiral one
 MSmits: Heh heh, not by hand jacek&#160;:)
 MSmits: you can do it with 1 hidden layer and all input types on. Or just x1 and x2 and maybe 2 hidden layers and a lot of patience
 struct: oh I can change the values by hand
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/FOrI4tm.png">https://i.imgur.com/FOrI4tm.png</a>
 MSmits: yep that's how it's done
 MSmits: the nice thing about this site is that you can cut it into pieces, turn off stuff so that your students only see the parts you want
 MSmits: I put this in an i-frame
 MSmits: in my learning environment
 struct: you did this by hand jacek?
 MSmits: no lol
 struct: impressive :p
 struct: im joking ofc
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I was trying to do the upper right one with only x1 and x2 smh
 Aldoggen: then I see there's an input that pretty much looks liket
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: this kind of also teaches you it can be good to preprocess the input
 MSmits: make it easier on the NN
 MSmits: it's like that for games on CG as well. If you use domain knowledge in addition to training an NN, it will be better
 MSmits: though you have to be careful, as your own preconceived notions of a game can handicap a NN as well
 MSmits: an example is fixing your NN for CSB (mad pod racing) to have a blocker and a runner. Sure that is the meta and probably correct, but it's not necessarily always the best way.
 struct: i wonder if they pass timeout as input or not
 struct: the 100 rounds needed to pass a checkpoint
 Aldoggen: I saw some videos on the home page of csb. it looked nothing like what the lower leagues do
 struct: legend league is different
 Aldoggen: most of the time they stood there, and suddenly one of them went to a checkpoint
 Aldoggen: it's crazy
 struct: it has 2 pods and max thrust is 200
 struct: and the replays you saw are from old bots
 struct: if you check top players replays its even better
 Aldoggen: ah, that might explain something then
 Aldoggen: but it looked as if bots had to wait until a checkpoint was assigned to them or something
 MSmits: nah 
 Aldoggen: or it's just quirkyness of old bots
 MSmits: typical game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/643216200">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/643216200</a>
 MSmits: (7th vs 8th)
 struct: oh recurse is timing out
 struct: some games
 MSmits: how many?
 struct: not that many
 struct: look this replay Aldoggen
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/491776441">https://www.codingame.com/replay/491776441</a>
 struct: rank 1 vs rank 2
 struct: the move between frame 30 and 40 is nice
 Aldoggen: first replay looks more like wrestling
 struct: on this replay you can see that recurse runner also act as a blocker
 MSmits: the game is like wrestling
 struct: which i dont think its very common for other bots
 MSmits: no it's not
 MSmits: so that was exactly my point. If you limit your bot like a runner can only run, then that may work, but it may also make it weaker
 jacek: having preprocess inputs has big impact on nn performance. see nnue how it made stockfish much stronger
 MSmits: it's hard to say if recurse's bot is best because he allows this or not
 Aldoggen: understood MSmits&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: and struct and jacek. I guess I'm the student of today's chat&#160;:)
 jacek: last lectures on the chat
 MSmits: there's always quiet students&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: true&#160;:)
 MSmits: lurking students
 Aldoggen: the ones that never turn on their webcam
 MSmits: those are the worst
 Aldoggen: XD
 Aldoggen: are they paying attention? do they understand what's going on?
 jacek: back in my days, there werent any webcams or remote lessons
 Aldoggen: are they even THERE?
 jacek: playing cs or minecraft
 Aldoggen: imagine saying: I played cs today in a cs lecture
 MSmits: I had students literally waking up in my google meet
 MSmits: they got up out of bed with their phone in their hand
 Aldoggen: lol
 MSmits: livestreaming their morning ritual almost

 jacek: :neutral_face:
 j4at: jacek how many actions are you using for breakthrough 
 jacek: none
 jacek: i have only value
 j4at: huh&#160;?
 j4at: so action is part of the input&#160;?
 j4at: or do you valeu state
 jacek: value state
 j4at: lame :p
 jacek: its eval. like you'd use in minimax or mcts-ept
 j4at: yeah I don't want to mix algorithms with nns 
 jacek: you cant win in board games with nn only
 j4at: you are probably correct but I will try my best
 j4at: are you using dqn&#160;?
 jacek: its more like alpha-zero, except its value only
 DomiKo: to train you are using jacek-max too?
 jacek: hmm so bowwowforeach uses NN in UTTT? :thinking: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/07/05/195417">https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/07/05/195417</a>
 j4at: ow
 jacek: for some games
 jacek: best-first minimax (overwriting scores) works better, for others mcts (averaging scores) is better
 DomiKo: i see
 DomiKo: in my understanding mcts should be easier to train, because of averaging
 DomiKo: some stuff will get a little bit bigger value and some a little bit less
 JudgeDoom: NECESITO AYUDA, alguien ahi&#160;?
 jacek: actually im using combination of both. i have 2 scores in node - minimax and cumulative. and depending on game i use 20% jacekmax and 80% mcts-ept, or other way around
 DomiKo: yeah I saw that in marchete code
 DomiKo: he leaved a comment for it
 jacek: huh
 DomiKo: one second

 <b>**BlaiseEbuth give a help me to JudgeDoom</b></p><p><img src="/a/53571582931469" /> Rikus: Do you think that AZ will most likely beat DQN+MCTS in most CG games? (same CG constraints for both)
 DomiKo: yes it will
 DomiKo: not only in CG games, but in most games
 jacek: whats DQN+MCTS ;o
 Darleanow: rc95401&#160;?
 DomiKo: first you train DQN, and then use it as eval to MCTS
 DomiKo: like they did in CSB
 jacek: oh
 Rikus: yeap
 Rikus: cool, I had double thoughts regarding the difference in the throughput of inferences that DQN vs AZ and maybe it could be _better_ for some games, but unlikely
 DomiKo: yeah AZ can learn much much more
 Rikus: great, so, I cannot come up with any more excuses for starting this journeybesides the challenge itself
 DomiKo: it really long journey, but it's so fun
 Rikus: thanks for the info and motivation ^_^
 MSmits: DomiKo jacek does beat all the azero bots on oware
 DomiKo: what about robo?
 MSmits: he wasnt azero, maybe he is now i dunno
 DomiKo: O.o
 DomiKo: so what is robo?
 Astrobytes: think it was based around that no?
 MSmits: could be
 Astrobytes: robozero
 DomiKo: wasn't he using policy?
 MSmits: i think azero could be better in general but in really simple games it might not be
 MSmits: games like oware and othello can be played near perfectly by many types of bots
 Rikus: by simple you mean C4/UTT vs CSB/SpringChallenge21?
 MSmits: it's just a question of whether they make 0 or 1 or 2 mistakes per game
 MSmits: Rikus C4 and UTTT yes
 MSmits: CSB/spring challenge 21 no
 DomiKo: as I read some papers I think in simple games, when you have near perfect games, still AZ can learn much faster than any type of DQN
 MSmits: ahh ok, learn faster sure. But that is irrelevant for simple games
 MSmits: the end result is all that matters
 DomiKo: it still takes a lot of power to learn such games
 MSmits: I guess it depends on the simplicity
 MSmits: oware is really really simple though
 DomiKo: yeah it is
 Rikus: yeap, that's why I've dropped the idea of ZeroEfficient, it learns way faster (and ruleless) than AZ, but I couldn't find a single source that states that it can beat AZ with 'infinite' training
 Rikus: *EfficientZero
 MSmits: it's hard to test this too. These bots tend to become very deterministic. You'll think you are playing 1000 games but you'll be playing like 3 different ones
 struct: just add random like jacek
 MSmits: yeah, you have to
 DomiKo: I've never heard about EfficientZero
 struct: thats usually whats used to describe me
 DomiKo: MSmits the problem in comparing is that you can't do it
 DomiKo: nobody will give you their implementation, so basically you can't compare anything&#160;:(
 struct: if cg is up by the time I understand how to make a NN ill share it
 DomiKo: good
 DomiKo: I'll wait then
 Aldoggen: riiight here waiting for you
 struct: I'll be back in a few years
 DomiKo: because I can't fix my pipeline&#160;:( 
 Darleanow: could someone help me with code optimisation&#160;?
 Darleanow: it's for block the spreading fire
 DomiKo: what language?
 Darleanow: py
 DomiKo: ok lets go
 Darleanow: u have discord&#160;?
 j4at: cg should add pypy3
 MSmits: DomiKo i was more talking about trying the NN's on the leaderboards of CG
 DomiKo: ok ok
 DomiKo: I see
 j4at: although numpy is slower in pypy
 MSmits: one could be ranked above the other because it always wins vs the other, but it's the same game every time
 MSmits: tweak 1 weight and it's the other way around
 MSmits: this is why i like jacek's bots, he adds random to his moves
 DomiKo: everybody have to 
 MSmits: they should but they dont
 struct: not every1
 DomiKo: but something you model give like 0.99 for one move and a little random won't change anything
 MSmits: that's true, but in a game like oware, where you both make 100 choices, some may be different
 DomiKo: I tried using your endgame stuff 
 Astrobytes: and nobody wants their top NN booked by Smits .... :D
 struct: you are never safe from MSmit s
 Astrobytes: was thinking of one in particular...
 Aldoggen: there are ways to make Ais trip over themselves <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5wtoH0_KuA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5wtoH0_KuA</a>maybe adding random helps against that too?
 MSmits: oh how did it go DomiKo
 MSmits: it's not easy to implement
 DomiKo: I added it for validation.
 MSmits: oh that's cool
 MSmits: if you do it locally, you can go way higher with time, 15-20 is possible
 DomiKo: not really
 MSmits: how so?
 DomiKo: because there are a lot of different scores for the same position but with different turn limit
 jacek: i tested it. one bot had the endgame and the other didnt. if there were like 6-7 seeds, it was winning more. but more seeds like over 10 led to more draws ;d
 MSmits: yes thats why i said 15-20
 MSmits: if you dont have the turn limit, you can go to 38 like i did&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's nearly 100 GB but worth it&#160;:)
 DomiKo: I tried validating positons with 1,2, 10, 20.. turn limit, and my model can solve around 70% of them
 DomiKo: by solving I mean do the perfect move just by looking at the policy
 MSmits: oh, that's good isnt it?
 MSmits: did you include the turn in your input? That might not be good
 DomiKo: I don't know that the problem :joy:
 MSmits: robo never did this
 MSmits: robo assumes infinite game length
 jacek: neither do i
 DomiKo: yeah i did
 MSmits: if you assume infinite, it's much easier to generate a large endgame book
 MSmits: 1 result per gamestate
 struct: The secret is to add the turn as input 3 times
 MSmits: huh?
 DomiKo: or more than 1
 struct: im joking MSmits
 MSmits: oh, i can never tell struct :P
 DomiKo: it's not a joke
 DomiKo: it's reality
 struct: Apparently im not MSmits
 MSmits: see, even you can't tell struct
 jacek: is this hexapawnzero reference?
 struct: yes jacek
 MSmits: After all these years of uttt, i think i just made my bot 5% better!
 struct: o.o
 Aldoggen: that's 5% better than nothing!
 MSmits: made it solve a bit faster and changed my implementation of the free move penalty
 struct: 5% is a lot
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: 5% better winrate?
 Aldoggen: 5% more toast
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/wHqf4eG">https://imgur.com/a/wHqf4eG</a>
 MSmits: wr vs best bot
 MSmits: 1000 games per dot
 jacek: or it overfitted against that bot
 MSmits: this is not really a parameter that can overfit i think
 MSmits: it's about discouraging giving away free moves
 MSmits: 0 means no discouragement
 struct: so it prevents giving a free move to opponent?
 struct: like a penalty if you give
 MSmits: yeah, if it's 0 it doesnt
 MSmits: right
 jacek: i had that when i used simple mcts
 MSmits: i had this before, but this one is implemented differently
 Aldoggen: and you're certain there's no zugzwang-mechanic in tttu?
 MSmits: yeah everyone has that i think, at the top
 MSmits: hmm
 struct: not me
 struct: but im not at the top
 Aldoggen: lol
 jacek: thats why
 MSmits: there's no zugzwang i think
 Aldoggen: we'll see how it performs I guess
 struct: are you sure?
 struct: what about zugzwang with moves that wont make you lose?
 MSmits: doubt you'll notice, i am below 4 nn's and a bunch of players that are nearly the same strength. 5% isnt enough to over come bad luck i think
 jacek: well theres plenty of zugzwang if you forced in mini-board to play move beneficial for opponent
 Aldoggen: that's the definition of zugzwang I guess
 MSmits: yeah but as it relates to giving away a free move, you basically do the opposite of zugzwang
 MSmits: if moving anywhere you want is bad, then you've lost the game
 MSmits: so giving away a free move is objectively bad, you only do it when it gives you something really good, like an important board win
 MSmits: or you prevent an opponent board win
 MSmits: penalizing this, makes the search converge faster
 Aldoggen: should be fine&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh and i also put in pessimistic optimistic bounds
 MSmits: i had something similar, but i put in the real algorithm
 MSmits: this is where you dont just keep track of the solved result, but also the minimum expected and maximum expected game result. Kind of like ab-pruning
 MSmits: i solve a little bit faster, so the 5% is a combination of that and the free move param
 Aldoggen: what do those expected game results tell you?
 MSmits: if it is [-1,0]  for example, then you can have at best a draw and at worst a loss
 MSmits: or if it is [0,1] then it's at worst a draw
 MSmits: so it's like a partially solved state
 MSmits: if a child has [0,1] then its parent as at most 0
 MSmits: has at
 Cultist: hi guys
 Darleanow: someone else to help me with code optimisation&#160;?
 MSmits: this way, if you encounter a bunch of draws in your tree, you wont have so solve every state
 Cultist: i'm stucked with mad pod racing
 Aldoggen: so that helps you to prune some stuff?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: like ab pruning in a minimax
 Cultist: I didn't get what I have to do
 Darleanow: just pm me if u do&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I'll go read up on it&#160;:)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/mcsolver.pdf">https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/mcsolver.pdf</a>
 Astrobytes: aka "the paper with the most hated pseudocode on CG"
 MSmits: no not that one
 MSmits: this has the score boundds
 Astrobytes: oh gotcha
 MSmits: it's not the original mcts solver paper
 MSmits: it references it though&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: yeah I remember this one too
 Aldoggen: lol
 MSmits: tbh i dont really get the pseudo code here either. I used the pictures :0
 Aldoggen: XD 
 Aldoggen: is that a paper you've bookmarked? or how did you find it?
 jacek: he paid for it
 MSmits: i googled it just now
 MSmits: i know the title
 jacek: Cultist is this the first wood league?
 Astrobytes: pseudocode in this one is far better than solver paper
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: no weird recursion
 MSmits: also, the original paper doesnt even allow draws
 MSmits: this one allows any kind of score
 Astrobytes: True.
 Aldoggen: it looks like standard latex. I have fond memories of that
 struct: Did you ever try monte carlo graph search MSmits?
 jacek: tree is a graph, so yes [solved]
 MSmits: what do you mean struct
 struct: its similar to mcts but it handles transpositions
 MSmits: Aldoggen the original mcts solver paper is still good for the idea of having a solver in mcts. Starting straight with the score bounds might be a bit hard
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: its very clearly explained
 jacek: with pseudocode
 MSmits: lol, skip the damn pseudo code :P
 Aldoggen: XD
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 MSmits: yup
 Aldoggen: ty
 struct: this is what im talking about MSmits
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ml.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/papers/czech2021icaps_mcgs.pdf">https://www.ml.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/papers/czech2021icaps_mcgs.pdf</a>
 MSmits: can you give the general idea?
 MSmits: wait, thats machine learning lol
 Aldoggen: similar states get merged?
 Aldoggen: and I like the papers, they're to the point, but clear
 MSmits: oh mcts and transpositions
 MSmits: that's a rabbit hole
 MSmits: I've done more than one version of that
 Aldoggen: is the idea that you're computing a state and going "wait a minute! I've seen that before!", after which you skip it?
 MSmits: you can do that in minimax
 MSmits: it becomes problematic in mcts
 MSmits: because you gather statistics on visits and score
 MSmits: you get a new child, that's not new
 MSmits: so you have 1 child that has 0 vists and another with 100k
 struct: maybe ill test minimax on bt 
 struct: Im gonna check how many repeated positions I get
 struct: I bet its a lot
 MSmits: in bt a lot yes
 struct: If I take into account mirrored
 MSmits: in uttt, pretty rare
 MSmits: it's not really about the mirror struct
 MSmits: it's about doing moves in different orders
 MSmits: first move A then B, or first move B, then A
 MSmits: same end result
 MSmits: mirror is rare in the same game, as most states are very assymetric
 jacek: yeah, my bt improved when i cached positions with evaled children
 Aldoggen: if you have n moves for which the order doesn't matter, you can save about n! move evaluations or something
 MSmits: yes
 struct: o.o
 struct: I never really did that
 struct: only on green circle I think
 jacek: dont you use TT in minimax struct?
 Aldoggen: (amount of orders to sort n elements)
 struct: never jacek
 jacek: not even for move ordering?
 MSmits: n! is not necessarily very big if you dont get much depth of course
 struct: nope
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: depth 10 is only 5 of your moves
 MSmits: so it's like 5!
 Aldoggen: 120
 struct: I dont really have any minmax bot
 MSmits: yes, that is if you do a full search
 struct: Only lines of actions is minmax
 Aldoggen: ah true
 MSmits: i do this kind of hashing in yavalath
 jacek: woah astro 4th
 Aldoggen: but hey guys, you'll never believe it:
 MSmits: it doesnt help much at the beginning (branching 61), but it helps a ton near the end
 struct: is there any  term to describe this?
 struct: like playing A B == B A
 MSmits: they are transpositions
 MSmits: which is why you use a TT
 struct: so you just handle this by storing the gamestate in the table?
 MSmits: you use a hashtable
 Aldoggen: gamestates are big
 Aldoggen: comparing is also hard
 MSmits: for yavalath you'd use xorshift(p1) ^xorshift(p2)
 GuillaumeMathe: Improved <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-spreadsheet">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-spreadsheet</a> solution with ES2020 nullish coalescing operator&#160;:)
 MSmits: not necessarily Aldoggen, simple boardgames it's usually comparing 2 or 3 integers only
 Aldoggen: ah true&#160;:) but I'm used to storing my game state as classes
 struct: I see, thanks
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/EYuh6M7J">https://pastebin.com/EYuh6M7J</a>
 MSmits: for my yavalath opening book
 MSmits: it's not very performant because it's unordered set, but it's simple
 MSmits: I have a more performant implementation for the actual TT
 MSmits: my TT is lossy, so i overwrite old states sometimes. Unordered set doesnt allow this
 MSmits: and i dont want my book to be lossy&#160;:)
 Westicles: oh my, look at the forum
 MSmits: link it
 struct: thanks MSmits
 MSmits: np
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/this-is-why-i-cant-learn-to-code/19298/14">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/this-is-why-i-cant-learn-to-code/19298/14</a>
 MSmits: the other implementation isnt secret either, but i dont want to spam it here and didnt feel like digging it up. If you need it let me know
 Aldoggen: oh wow Westicles. I'll get some pop corn later. first this paper
 struct: sure
 MSmits: sigh, these people just don't understand there simply is a bar of entry that CG is not obligated to help you pass
 MSmits: you need to do that elsewhere first
 struct: yeah I dont think CG goal is to teach you the basics
 struct: there are plenty of sites that do that
 Aldoggen: there is too much stuff that we even don't remember we know
 Aldoggen: like it's just assumed
 struct: if I take into account mirrored from the start position at depth 4
 struct: 87% of repeated positions
 struct: o.o
 struct: 232847 repeated 267675 total
 Aldoggen: lol that's a bunch
 MSmits: yep
 Aldoggen: for chess that wouldn't fly
 MSmits: no, chess is different
 MSmits: people still use TT though, it's especially important late game
 Aldoggen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/j6NuL3t">https://imgur.com/a/j6NuL3t</a>
 Aldoggen: nice
 MSmits: however it is totally possible to halve your simcount if you implement TT struct. It's often not worth it. Not many bots i have use TT
 MSmits: and for mcts TT is much weaker than for minimax
 struct: yeah I wont use TT for mcts
 struct: for minimax and bt I think it should be worth
 struct: to use TT
 MSmits: whats that last term in the formula Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: I'd guess progressive bias?
 MSmits: yes struct, TT is almost standard with minimax
 Aldoggen: haven't read the paragraph fully
 MSmits: could be something like that yeah
 MSmits: hey, how much do you know about mcts Aldoggen? Seems you know at least some?
 jacek: progressive bias... that brings some memories
 Aldoggen: I know some stuff by absorption
 Aldoggen: I know MC is basically choosing things at random
 MSmits: yeah, but you can make MC smarter than just random
 MSmits: by heuristics
 Aldoggen: so I had a reasonable guess for what mcts was once I knew what the abbreviations stood for
 MSmits: but do you know the phases of mcts and what they do?
 Aldoggen: I've just read the overview of it&#160;:)
 struct: I dont think my mcts has any randomness to it
 MSmits: ahh ok. If you want to try it, it's best to do it on a game where random rollouts till end of game works well
 MSmits: this is true for UTTT and C4
 jacek: then is it really mcts?
 Aldoggen: c4?
 struct: dont think so jacek
 struct: connect 4
 MSmits: connect 4
 Aldoggen: aah
 Aldoggen: mm I might try that actually
 MSmits: just take into account C4 has a small leaderboard and UTTT has a very large leaderboard
 MSmits: if you want to feel a sense of accomplishment, UTTT is better
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 MSmits: C4 is full of pro's
 Aldoggen: and the highest league is wood 1
 MSmits: that too
 Aldoggen: and you're nr 1 nice
 MSmits: i have an opening book which is what makes me stick out
 MSmits: my bot is as good as struct's and darkhorse's
 MSmits: without the book
 Aldoggen: I sense you're trying to steer me towards uttt. are you afraid I might pass you?&#160;;)
 MSmits: no no, please go ahead and do C4&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: was only joking&#160;:)
 MSmits: I know, important thing is to have fun
 struct: connect 4 sim should be easier
 Aldoggen: yup
 _Royale: MSmits: I don't know if someone mentionned it, for MCTS transpositions you can attach the visits to the edges instead of the nodes
 MSmits: mcts can be a bit frustrating the first time. You need  a frame work that is bug free. Finding bugs in your framework is not easy
 Aldoggen: but do you need a sim for mcts?
 struct: yes Aldoggen
 MSmits: _Royale are edges separate objects then?
 struct: Aldoggen I would try to mcts TTT first, the normal version
 Aldoggen: how so?
 struct: its easier to denug
 MSmits: Aldoggen you'll need a sim for minimax and mcts both, but mcts has a bit more to code around that, not a lot, but a bit
 _Royale: MSmits: yes, you transpose the nodes, and each node as its own edges to children
 MSmits: ahh ok
 _Royale: MSmits: and the visits of a node is the sum of the visits of its edges
 MSmits: that solves 1 problem
 Aldoggen: oh, do you need a sim to make sure you're doing valid moves?
 MSmits: but it comes with a performance penalty right?
 struct: Aldoggen your sim should only give legal moves, but is more to check the current state of the game
 MSmits: Aldoggen yes, all nodes of the tree correspond to new gamestates
 _Royale: MSmits: yes, but I use it on most board games because the performance penalty become negligible with NN cost
 MSmits: ahh yes i can see that
 MSmits: a lot of fancy stuff becomes doable because performance is no longer an issue
 MSmits: like weird ucb formulas
 _Royale: it helps to reuse the solved nodes too
 MSmits: yeah. The way I do it is i store the index to the first child and the number of children in a TT so two parents can have the same set of children, but this does give me the problem of weird visitcounts
 _Royale: yes it's one "good" this with this NN cost, you can spend less time optimizing your simulator&#160;:)
 MSmits: that too yeah
 _Royale: MSmits: for a long time I had transpositions with that visits bug, as you said earlier hard to debug everything
 MSmits: well it's not really a bug, it's a choice. You have to accept weird visit counts and maybe a biased search, or have a far greater performance penalty and use the unbiased method you describe
 MSmits: for a normal mcts using millions of nodes i dont think having edge objects can work, but i can totally see it for NN's
 _Royale: maybe for games with lots of transpositions?
 MSmits: yeah, i would have to test it, it might not be as bad as i just said
 MSmits: i mean you take the visits and wins off the original nodes, so they become smaller at least
 MSmits: you have nodes, leading to edges, leading to nodes again
 _Royale: yes
 Aldoggen: you'd have to identify edges with each other as well
 Darleanow: Hey _Royale , i've pm'd you&#160;:)
 MSmits: the edges will come in sets
 _Royale: edges can contain probabilities too if you have a policy network
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: so whats on the nodes _Royale? 
 MSmits: solved result i guess
 MSmits: but also moves?
 jacek: i just use transpositions as nncache
 _Royale: moves are in the edges too here
 MSmits: that should be very effective also jacek
 DomiKo: custom hashmaps jacek?
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense _Royale, i just wonder what is left on the nodes
 jacek: just unordered_map
 _Royale: nodes contain the state, its value and wether its solved or not
 MSmits: hmm how do you get the value?
 MSmits: if the visits and score are on the edges?
 MSmits: you just update it every time the edges get updated?
 _Royale: MSmits: you mean the backpropagation? yes it updates the edges and nodes
 MSmits: also, i dont always store the state on the node. Sometimes it's just the move. I guess it is mandatory in this case
 MSmits: makes sense, thanks for sharing _Royale
 Darleanow: anybody had idea to optimize/do something better than bfs algo?
 Aldoggen: bread first search mmm
 MSmits: I find it hard to even imagine using bfs with that forest fire optim
 MSmits: i mean i can imagine spreading the fire that way, but i wouldnt know how to pick squares to block with
 Westicles: can you anneal it?  haven't read it
 MSmits: i suggested SA to Darleanow, so i hope so :P
 MSmits: you can have an initial solution and then make small alterations
 MSmits: i guess it can work
 MSmits: he seems to have an initial solution so...
 Westicles: It works for everything if you have the cores
 MSmits: what are cores in this contest?
 MSmits: context
 Westicles: offline cpu
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: i thought you were throwing fancy SA lingo at me
 _Royale: MSmits: no problem, if I remember correctly martinpapa69 does the same for MCTS transpositions
 MSmits: also with NN
 MSmits: good to know
 Darleanow: i've looked a bti for anneal
 _Royale: jacek: I think Robostac does that too? (nncache)
 Darleanow: i'm just looking for more suggestions&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: it's a graph theory problem, the firefighter problem, search it up
 MSmits: Darleanow I am going to make some assumptions here, so i might be way off
 MSmits: you build up some border around the fire right?
 MSmits: it extends just far enough to beat it?
 Astrobytes: That's an approach I would try yes
 jacek: _Royale its easiest to implement, it just saves NN computations
 MSmits: i imagine small alterations to this border
 Darleanow: indeed
 MSmits: and then simulation to see if its better
 Darleanow: i'm computing all possible areas in 5 secs max
 Darleanow: and chose the best based on it's score
 MSmits: but you might have to do several smaller borders
 Astrobytes: yes MSmits
 Astrobytes: you might be better off sacrificing a larger area somewhere and saving a few more valuable area
 Astrobytes: s
 MSmits: yeah
 Darleanow: its a randint from 1 to width+height/2
 Astrobytes: very topcoder-ish optim this one
 MSmits: so you'll have to define a solution in such a way that your SA algorithm can randomly come up with new ones
 Darleanow: tried with width+height
 jacek: ah well just wait for the solutions to be revealed :v
 DomiKo: :upside_down:
 MSmits: yeah i dont get that, it's an optim arena and everyone can see the code
 MSmits: it's so weird
 Astrobytes: no it won't be shared
 MSmits: it says that it will
 Astrobytes: confirmed by T
 Astrobytes: check the date
 MSmits: oh ok, good
 Westicles: I gotta fix my PC and give it a try
 youngG: can somebody recommend me a good laptop
 youngG: to program
 Astrobytes: one that works and has a keyboard. Possibly a screen too.
 youngG: lol
 struct: maybe not a chromebook
 struct: or w/e its called
 DomiKo: strong chromebooks are cool
 MSmits: ugh
 youngG: definitely not a chromebook
 Aldoggen: maybe a touchpad if you're fancy
 MSmits: chromebooks are my nemesis
 Darleanow: yeah but like i want to get a good top&#160;:)
 youngG: damn
 Westicles: laptops die too easily
 MSmits: I teach 1 class that uses chromebooks instead of windows PC's
 DomiKo: I'm using chromebook at work&#160;;( 
 struct: lol DomiKo
 Aldoggen: youngG most of the responses here were sarcastic
 MSmits: we were working on game design and all i could use for it was flowlabs, which is a poor substitute for everything else
 DomiKo: pls no hate
 MSmits: this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://flowlab.io/">https://flowlab.io/</a>
 MSmits: it's at best... ok
 Aldoggen: lol in the browser
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: Gdevelop is much better
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gdevelop.io/">https://gdevelop.io/</a>
 MSmits: but comes with install... so no chromebook
 Sheeesh---: the website design is soo cool!
 MSmits: which one?
 Sheeesh---: gdevelop
 MSmits: ah yes i think so too
 MSmits: I might be using it next year with my other clases
 MSmits: when i can use my own classroom that has windows PCs
 Aldoggen: hype
 MSmits: whats hype?
 Aldoggen: yay happy because something good is going to happen
 Aldoggen: it's a feeling
 MSmits: oh ok yes

 GuillaumeMathe: better&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Jnza3wdR">https://pastebin.com/Jnza3wdR</a>
 MSmits: works
 GuillaumeMathe: wanted to build a good example for JS beginners and people who want to learn newer Ecmascript
 MSmits: oh
 GuillaumeMathe: (this improves on the best current voted solution)
 MSmits: I see
 GuillaumeMathe: This puzzle is a very cool example on where to use that new "??=" operator&#160;;)
 MSmits: tbh i dont really know the puzzle
 GuillaumeMathe: it's just about memoization
 MSmits: oh, i have 100%
 MSmits: i must have done it
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 MSmits: ohhh that one!!
 GuillaumeMathe: JS can memoize in a function by closure, this is an example of how to do it in one instruction
 jacek: was it really memoization?
 jacek: if you dont remember it
 GuillaumeMathe: lol
 MSmits: mine didnt seem like memoization anyway
 GuillaumeMathe: well there's not much else to it&#160;;)
 MSmits: I see a bunch of loopy
 MSmits: 96 lines of loopy ifs
 GuillaumeMathe: thats a bit too much aint it&#160;;)
 MSmits: it worked
 GuillaumeMathe: I like elegant functional code
 MSmits: I like code that works just well enough so that I can use it and then never look at it again :P
 MSmits: not always an option unfortunately
 GuillaumeMathe: that's self inflicting pain in a real work environment&#160;!
 GuillaumeMathe: trust me on that lol

 GuillaumeMathe: ah alright sorry mate
 MSmits: funny Aldoggen&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 MSmits: GuillaumeMathe i am just kidding, i do have some style in my code, but i dont worry about these 1-time puzzles
 Aldoggen: there's thousands of those comics
 MSmits: yeah i have seen them before
 MSmits: i resubmitted my utt btw, hope it will get at least 8 like before
 MSmits: though it should be better than it was even if it doesnt, might need other people to submit, pushing it further
 GuillaumeMathe: As I said I'm trying to bring better ES/JS solutions if that's relevant, to help people who are here to learn&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats nice GuillaumeMathe
 GuillaumeMathe: thanks
 MSmits: some use JS yeag
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I started here with C#, then switched to c++ performance and later to python for puzzles
 MSmits: i like python over C# because less typing
 MSmits: (typing as in hitting the keyboard)
 Aldoggen: syntactic sugar and convenience functions and methods ftw
 GuillaumeMathe: yeah that's what I like in more recent ES versions
 Westicles: there are only 2 non-WIP puzzles that look worth approving
 MSmits: I'm sorry you had to look at all of them to determine this Westicles
 Aldoggen: good thing other people think alike, otherwise we'd be swamped with garbage
 Aldoggen: I think I've approved one or two puzzles in 16 days
 Westicles: I didn't look at the clashes, those are all probably fine
 MSmits: thats one hell of an assumption
 Aldoggen: I beg to differ
 Aldoggen: do you remember lisa has ideas?
 Aldoggen: artificial emotional intelligence? 
 Aldoggen: wait was that a clash?
 Aldoggen: it wasn't
 Westicles: that wasn't the best
 MSmits: Is that the one you got worked up over Westicles?
 Westicles: I was whining about the tennis one more I think
 MSmits: there was one about women and bodyweight
 Westicles: oh, that one was great.  javacoffee
 Westicles: though it has a trivial O(1) solution
 Westicles: but it set off the white knights riding to protect the ladies
 Aldoggen: body weight is a girl's secret?
 MSmits: Did they try to solve it using progressive bias?
 Westicles: Just the usual --However does it really need to be gendered in this way? We all know that in the tech industry we struggle to attract diverse people...
 MSmits: I know, I read that
 MSmits: without trying to start a whole conversation about it and get the mods up in arms, I am a leftie, but some of this identity politics makes me sad also
 Girard: :bento:
 Aldoggen: could have been about truck drivers weighing their trucks while competition was watching
 Aldoggen: I guess it wasn't necessary after all
 MSmits: yeah I agree, you can have lots of themes, but people could stand to be a little less sensitive about some things and focus on real problems I think
 Aldoggen: true
 Westicles: Yeah, I got a comment the kiss the girls would be better if it was about rats :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: rofl
 Aldoggen: kiss the rats?
 Aldoggen: lol
 Astrobytes: interesting
 MSmits: well my submit is done. Got to the same rank basically. So I am convinced I didnt break anything
 Aldoggen: rank 8?
 MSmits: it was still going up, so i guess it'd settle at 7 with a few more games
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 MSmits: no, it's at 9, but it's 0.08 below the 7th
 Aldoggen: they're pretty close together then
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I could rank higher, but it has no opening book
 struct: my bot loses too much as p1
 struct: it should not happen
 MSmits: i might generate a new one, once i am done trying some more stuff
 MSmits: struct at your rank it should win 70% as p1
 MSmits: where karliso is at, it is around 90%
 struct: i have no idea tbh
 struct: I never tested my bot locally
 MSmits: should be easy to do
 MSmits: there's a nice trick to it
 struct: yeah just not really interested in it
 MSmits: you dont need a sim even
 struct: whats the trick?
 MSmits: just let your bots output "win" or "loss" as a solved result
 struct: ah yes
 MSmits: and your "arena" just believes them
 struct: I do that 
 struct: for other games
 struct: I just pass last played move
 MSmits: yeah 
 struct: and I only output win not loss
 Aldoggen: wait, this works?
 struct: because I need to make sure the other bot finds the win
 struct: Aldoggen yes you can even create a referee to handle this for brutaltester
 MSmits: Aldoggen no, i think you misunderstand
 struct: Yes its not trivial
 struct: as it sounded
 MSmits: we do this locally on our own computer
 MSmits: we let bots fight eachother
 Aldoggen: ah, if your bot thinks he wins, you shortcut to the next game?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: exactly
 Aldoggen: all right&#160;:)
 struct: he doesnt think
 struct: he is sure
 MSmits: he proves it
 Aldoggen: yes
 MSmits: this is how i just fitted that parameter
 Aldoggen: what is the advantage, except speed gain?
 MSmits: you dont need to code a whole sim in your arena
 Aldoggen: struct spoke about not winning enough as p1
 MSmits: oh that migth not even be true, he needs to test that first
 Aldoggen: or is that about something else
 MSmits: thats just how his bot performs
 MSmits: he has a pretty strong uttt bot he thinks should be winning more as p1
 MSmits: p1 has a major advantage in uttt
 MSmits: probably if we could solve the game, it would be won by p1
 YurkovAS: great win rate vs me and tomatoes :thumbsup:
 Aldoggen: all right
 MSmits: might just be luck YurkovAS, this version has 5% over my old one
 MSmits: no opening book
 MSmits: vingte uses one btw
 MSmits: he's the only high ranked uttt with one atm afaik
 MSmits: btw thanks again YurkovAS for helping me set up that brutaltester for the last contest. I would not have been in legend without i think
 MSmits: the last effective thing i did was fitting params for my brute force bot
 YurkovAS: you are welcome!
 MSmits: I should get some sleep. GN
 struct: gn
 Aldoggen: good night!
 YurkovAS: gn
 Astrobytes: gn
 BleedPurp: hi
 Aldoggen: okay, I think I found the O(1) solution to body weight is a girl's secret
 Aldoggen: yay
 Westicles: :tada:

 Bashar: math.pow isnt giving correct answer
 tutubalin: Bashar can you give an example?
 Bashar: at a problem pow(2,7) was giving me 25
 Bashar: anyways i reported that
 darkhorse64: The problem is in your code not on the math lib
 tutubalin: +1
 tutubalin: something wrong with your code, don't blame library that was used by millions people before you
 jrke: which lang bashar&#160;?
 jrke: math.pow i think python or java
 jacek: pow(2,7) = 25 in 22-based
 jacek: everyting's alright

 JBM: !ban
 dumb000001: me*
 dbdr: worse than random is better at antichess
 jacek: antichess has mandatory captures
 dbdr: there is a video about a guy writing silly chess AI
 dbdr: I wonder if it's the same guy
 wjan: I have a question to the "What the Brainfuck&#160;!" Puzzle. for the test "Noisy code" The given input is: ".                   Print the '!' character (33)".since there are none of the allowed instructions present ("&lt;"," &gt;"," +"," -"," ["," ]"," ."," ,") I output Nothing, however, the Expected result is "Hello World!".is this a misstake?
 Earthborne: wjan read all the lines as one stream
 wjan: ah i see . ty
 Earthborne: just ignore any characters that aren't opcodes and you'll be fine&#160;:)

 tutubalin: Earthborne i solved BF interpreter. it is pretty simple and can be done in multiple ways. one way is to interpret, another way is to generate code and eval it (if your language supports eval)
 tutubalin: wjan in BF every character which is not command is considered a comment and should be ignored
 tutubalin: dumb000001 i can explain DP. explanation will be much easier if you're using Python
 dbdr: jacek: yeah, I think it's the same guy
 jacek: hmm
 SuperBee5344: Can someone help me
 SuperBee5344: I'm new
 eulerscheZahl: ask a question and find out
 SuperBee5344: OK
 SuperBee5344: How do I turn faster on coders strike back?
 eulerscheZahl: your turning speed is limited to 18Â°
 eulerscheZahl: you can't turn faster
 SuperBee5344: Ok
 SuperBee5344: Thanks
 Lafihalas: When it says your pod orientation
 Lafihalas: What exactly does that mean
 SuperBee5344: Idk, I'm new
 SuperBee5344: And I'm struggling
 SuperBee5344: I can't find the code that I am used to
 Lafihalas: i accidentally made something that beaten the boss by half a round on some maps
 Lafihalas: but loses horribly on others
 SuperBee5344: O:

 TheScore: What the validators are?
 Scarfield: spamming will not help you SuperBee5344, asking a question might though
 SuperBee5344: Idk, I'm new
 SuperBee5344: My brain hurts...
 Lafihalas: pod orientation is direction of your current velocity right&#160;?
 Lafihalas: in the angle description
 Scarfield: no, you can turn with no thrust, and orientation and velocity will differ, your input will change depending on leagues though
 Scarfield: oh pod orientation is the angle which you pod is pointing Lafihalas, that is not necesarily the direction of pod vel
 Lafihalas: does it then correspond to the thrust you are currently exerting (assuming you didnt put it to 0) - since you can only eject it directly behind you
 Lafihalas: or is this also wrong
 Scarfield: the thrust (or acceleration vector) will be added to the current velocity vector. the acceleration vector will be: [cos(angle) * thrust, sin(angle) * thrust]
 Uljahn: the thrust is applied on pod's heading direction after it turns to the target, each turn the angle can be changed by 18 degrees max
 Scarfield: i dont remember how the angle is measured in CSB though, but you need to adjust it
 Lafihalas: y i figured out i will need to change it to radians to use sin and cos from math library
 Uljahn: ofc
 Scarfield: but also the sin/cos functions assumes the angle is measured positive from x-axis ccw
 Lafihalas: y i figured that out too
 Lafihalas: the angle during the turning
 Scarfield: nice
 Lafihalas: is the trickyest part
 Lafihalas: to figure out
 Lafihalas: when you make a quick turn
 Scarfield: what league are you in?
 Lafihalas: ah im just starting xD
 Lafihalas: wood 2
 Lafihalas: been playing this since last night
 Uljahn: do you use debug mode in visualizer?
 Lafihalas: no, how to do that
 Lafihalas: i need that badly xD
 Lafihalas: i have been using the output in the corner
 Lafihalas: to debug
 Lafihalas: and that is pretty limited xD
 Lafihalas: though i somehow managed, but its a bit of a pain
 Lafihalas: damn this chat doesnt support pictures&#160;:(
 Scarfield: the inputs will change for each league (?) untill bronze, so beware that you will have to change your functions/approach as well. start with something super simple to avoid the pain of chaning your code too much&#160;:)
 Lafihalas: so far they only added angle
 Lafihalas: didnt take anything away
 Lafihalas: but from what you said that might happen in wood2/1, i will lose some variables&#160;?
 Uljahn: there could be new inputs which your code couldn't handle right
 Scarfield: tbh i cant remember what changed and when, something like you only get next CP, then you get a list of all CPs
 Lafihalas: ah y i am hoping to see that one
 Lafihalas: one code i made
 Lafihalas: was amazing and beating the boss by half a round
 Lafihalas: but only worked for some maps
 Lafihalas: depending on checkpoint winding
 Uljahn: btw have you found :gear: icon in visualizer? debug mode should be there
 Scarfield: lol nice emote Uljahn&#160;:)
 Lafihalas: where to look for it
 Lafihalas: printscreen the image
 Lafihalas: and tell me pixel coordinates
 Scarfield: settings gear emote, just left of fullscreen and replay/share
 Lafihalas: nice
 Lafihalas: this will surely help
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 Lafihalas: btw
 Lafihalas: i will get speed info
 Lafihalas: later on
 Lafihalas: right&#160;?
 Lafihalas: for now i have to estimate it manually from the difference of last 2 frames
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab752f23-7159-4932-b3e5-231a23681d88">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab752f23-7159-4932-b3e5-231a23681d88</a>
 Lafihalas: yep awesome
 Scarfield: input for pods later ^  :)
 Lafihalas: just to get out of the wood xD
 Lafihalas: do you get the order checkpoints will go in
 Lafihalas: in advance
 Scarfield: yea
 Lafihalas: great
 markyy: the duck just reached level 11
 markyy: say gratz to the duck

 Lafihalas: check this out
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Scarfield: looks good&#160;:)
 Lafihalas: and the cool part is
 Lafihalas: i barely have an idea
 Lafihalas: on why its working
 Scarfield: xD

 Lafihalas: this is pretty much all the logic
 Lafihalas: chx and chy are distances to next checkpoint
 McAndersDK: I want Powershell as the scripting language for the games!!&#160;:)
 Uljahn: :relaxed:
 Gorbit99: McAndersDK there is a forum post where you can vote
 Scarfield: just started on Code vs Zombies, and have a bool for zombie class; "alive"... realised this is a bad name for it xD
 wlesavo: rename to "walking" :slight_smile:
 Scarfield: haha yea, thats better&#160;:)
 S_viper: hello
 AbundantPuddle: Hello S_viper.
 Lafihalas: How does rank work
 Lafihalas: I submit to play vs others to increase&#160;?
 Gorbit99: it's based on codinpoints
 Gorbit99: go to your profile, click on the question mark over your ranking
 Laminator: how on earth did 3 out of 5 of us just place top 3 in fastest within a 5 second window 7 minutes in haha
 tutubalin: Laminator easy. like "ok, i need to make sure there are no bugs, code looks nice, import are opti... OMG!!! somebody have alreadyy submitted, submit, submit, submit!"
 Lafihalas: has anyone encountered a bug where if you play multi the visualizer is frozen
 Lafihalas: also the rank is randomly decreasing when i win a game
 Laminator: I got 2nd place by a second. It didn't even show that someone had submitted lol does submitting as a reaction ever help with placement? I feel like it's a flawed reaction
 Lafihalas: I was literally rank 3, i won a game, and as a result dropped to rank 663
 Lafihalas: wtf
 Hjax: what game is this 
 jacek: The Game
 Hjax: im not very good at that one 
 Hjax: never won, only lost 
 Hjax: have any of you ever heard of an old arcade game called ataxx? someone was trying to convince me to write an ai for it yesterday 
 Hjax: i was thinking it might be a fun game for this site 
 jacek: kinda othelloish?
 Hjax: not exactly, because pieces can jump, a square that has a piece on it wont necessarily always have a piece on it 
 Hjax: so its not a pure board filling game like othello or go 
 Hjax: if you move a piece one tile, it creates a new piece, if you move a piece two tiles, it jumps without creating a new piece 
 Hjax: and captures are all adjacent and diagonal pieces 
 Hjax: i guess go captures can remove pieces, but pieces cant move from place to place
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: sounds good. but there are so many new board games now :c
 jacek: and no structs to make new ones
 The-Code-Whisperer: i dont get The Descent
 jacek: hm?
 AlexisMolestos: May I know your opinion about Docker?
 wlesavo: so, today i learned that in c++ ^&#160;!= pow, easy +40k in SG

 Gorbit99: or rather autocomplete

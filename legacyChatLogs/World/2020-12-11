 mzbear: finally fixed my buggy code, it seems i can finally generate all valid moves
 mzbear: 430 lines of code so far :D
 mzbear: there we go, submitted first version with a basic heuristic, picking largest shape that blocks the greatest number of potential enemy moves ... let's see how this fares
 mzbear: at least it's no longer rand() ... and it seems to be better
 mzbear: referee doesn't enforce all the rules!
 mzbear: ohwell.  next, i'll need to either setup a local referee or implement some search algorithm, and i dont want to do either lol.  this is too much work

 YodaMaster123: Please avoid placing these links here. I think that there is a channel dedicated to this stuff.
 Uljahn: #clash is for CoC invites, go there please
 jacek: oO

 davihear29: does anyone know how to play this
 davihear29: game
 vladshouldgetlost: because im confused by this 
 YodaMaster123: Ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why don't you just ask your question
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 YodaMaster123: :P
 davihear29: in knew to this
 jacobhasnofriends: hello how are you all?
 YodaMaster123: Fine&#160;:)
 jacobhasnofriends: good
 Astrobytes: You kids really should pay attention in school. Or you'll grow up to be idiots.
 YodaMaster123:&#160;? I do :P
 Astrobytes: not at you&#160;:)
 vladshouldgetlost: i do
 davihear29: Astrobytes these people r my friends 
 jacobhasnofriends: our computer science teacher is happy tho
 davihear29: they mess around a lot in  class
 davihear29: but our computer science teacher doesnt mind us playing this
 jacobhasnofriends: vlad is my name and user vladshouldgetlost is offending me
 jacobhasnofriends: block him
 Astrobytes: I'll kick you all again
 jacobhasnofriends: no please
 YodaMaster123: I see what you mean now _astrobytes
 jacobhasnofriends: block him
 jacobhasnofriends: its offensive
 jacobhasnofriends: telliung me to get lost
 Astrobytes: ttfn jacob
 AntiSquid: mistake island :thinking:
 davihear29: astrobytes jacobhasnofriends messes around in class 
 davihear29: hes very annoying
 AntiSquid: tell your teacher
 Astrobytes: not us
 davihear29: im trying to learn
 mzbear: take your drama elsewhere please
 Astrobytes: shut up and code then
 davihear29: but cba
 davihear29: i am
 Astrobytes: get out the chat and learn
 davihear29: im stuck tho
 AntiSquid: but you raise your issue here instead of classroom . none of us if present there
 davihear29: ok im sorry
 AntiSquid: is present *
 davihear29: i didnt mean it
 YodaMaster123: go on somr other site
 AntiSquid: lol YodaMaster123 no . 
 davihear29: no
 davihear29: im trying to learn python3
 Astrobytes: well ask a meaningful question, you might get a reply...
 YodaMaster123: :P AntiSquid_ they areny doing anything here anyway
 AntiSquid: they have class here, don't be mean 
 Astrobytes: some of them do try. Occasionally. 
 AntiSquid: but they could create their own chat room #plymoth_school done just like that
 Vlad123645: hello @vladshouldgetlost is offending me as he is bullying my name please deal with it
 AntiSquid: ok
 YodaMaster123: @Vlad123645 deal with this on #plymouth_school_clowns
 AntiSquid: now you insult the entire class
 davihear29: oi leave me out of this
 YodaMaster123: Sorry&#160;: üòê 
 Astrobytes: bans for those two next time squiddy
 Astrobytes: so do you have any questions davihear29
 YodaMaster123: Maybe they should raise the level requirement for chat? Right not its too easy to just create a new account and solve Oboarding for Chat privileges.
 Astrobytes: It is rather annoying at times
 AntiSquid: it should be on individual basis 
 Astrobytes: Maybe it should be like KoL, you have to take a literacy test at the Temple of Literacy before you get access to chat
 YodaMaster123: :joy:
 Vladisgettingbullied: :joy:
 Astrobytes: tks, sorry on phonecall
 AntiSquid: technically without them having access to chat they might be able to "constrate" better
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 PlsDontbanme: please dont ban me ill be good
 davihear29: astrobytes this is the annoying kid
 PlsDontbanme: oh wow
 PlsDontbanme: what did i do
 davihear29: plsdontbanme is the annoying kid
 PlsDontbanme: im not
 PlsDontbanme: u are
 davihear29: hes the one whos making a new account every time
 Rockstar555:  guys doing  coding to make a program
 Uljahn: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: bantastic!
 Astrobytes: Hopefully that'll keep it quiet for a bit
 nsrsn: guys i have a question. i started those days codingame solving easy puzzles. I came up to ASCII Art puzzle. Is a good approach to check firstly for solutions on internet and then try to solve or just go and try to realize the solution? 
 Astrobytes: nsrsn: do you really have to ask that? :o
 mzbear: nsrsn: always better to do it yourself, never try to find complete solutions off the internet
 nsrsn: if i can't do by myself?
 Astrobytes: check the forum, ask in chat etc
 AntiSquid: well if someone points a gun to your head and asks you to solve it quickly sure, but won't ever happen :P
 AntiSquid: ask what you're stuck with nsrsn
 Astrobytes: If you can't find any help in the forum, ask meaningful questions here or on discord and chances are someone will help you out
 mzbear: it's okay to google for generic things like "how to make a loop in python" or "how to sort a list", but don't google for anything puzzle-specific or you wont learn to think on your own
 Astrobytes: ^^^^ this all day long
 mzbear: pretty much anything from Stack Overflow site is fair game to use, you can find answers to a lot of basic programming things there
 AntiSquid: you get solutions once you solved it, you could google for other solutions too
 AntiSquid: actually you get solutions from this site only for the language you've done it in
 nsrsn: maybe let me ask better question: how you get 'good' at codingame?
 AntiSquid: do what you can do ... then the ones you can solve
 mzbear: just keep doing more of the easy ones, eventually you'll be able to spot medium ones that you know you have a shot at solving
 AntiSquid: find something that interest you, really best to skip puzzles you don't like aren't interested in
 mzbear: some "easy" puzzles aren't all that easy, and some "medium" puzzles aren't very hard at all
 AntiSquid: that line between easy and medium isn't as straightforward as the sites like you to believe, depends on topic / problem statement etc
 AntiSquid: between any difficulty level really
 AntiSquid: for example you might be able to solve breach already if you have the patience and it's in the hard / very hard section . so w/e
 mzbear: the more code you write the better you get at it.  and AFTER you have solved a puzzle, look at other people's solutions, and try to understand how they work. you'll learn new things
 Astrobytes: Breach belongs in the 'annoying' section :P
 AntiSquid: you might be better off to try a random multi game that interest you
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes i think the intent was to create a kind of "hacking/cybersecurity" themed puzzle, but it failed imo ... 
 Astrobytes: Yes, I agree.
 Uljahn: do classic puzzles first and community puzzles later, also you can deduce the difficulty level of a puzzle by the number of ppl who solved it
 nsrsn: ... and if you are actual software engineer: how codingame is helping do get better at programming? or better to ask: do really getting better at solving problems = getting better as a software engineer?
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN how about a "what's my mother's maiden name" puzzle as clash of code :thinking: let's see how good the clashers are at OSINT
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the problem with the contest and it compiles to the same parenth
 Astrobytes: lol
 Uljahn: you mean a software engineer doesn't solve problems?
 mzbear: codingame definitely helps you get better.  there are many types of programming puzzles that you might rarely run into at work, but every different type of puzzle helps you come up with new ways to think about solving problems
 AntiSquid: best to try and contribute to github repositories in that case ... nsrsn, that helps a lot more and also private projects, CG is general problem solving 
 mzbear: many of the techniques you learn are universally applicable, things you might not have thought of if you hadn't gotten exposed to them in a different context
 YodaMaster123: How come it has a typo that no one uses?
 YodaMaster123: The parenth thing that AutomatonNN said.
 AutomatonNN: and i still dont understand why you can do that
 Astrobytes: It's not the smartest bot in the world
 YodaMaster123: But it generates sentences from words right? How did it find that typo?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/</a>
 Automaton2000: and i still don't get how it works
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 YodaMaster123: :P They are pretty smart
 AntiSquid: because the lines are based on crap users wrote in chat, so if there are lots of typos and people ping euler nonstop you get Automatont NN
 Astrobytes: that article explains them both pretty well
 YodaMaster123: I see it "Such a character-level bot is also capable of misspelling (it might be desirable to reproduce common typos and variations) and producing non-words."
 Uljahn: NN (LSTM) generates sentences letter by letter i think, so there is a chance to fail at some point
 YodaMaster123: Yeah, I saw it. Awesome that it can even construct full words with such a high success rate!
 Astrobytes: It also pings euler
 Astrobytes: (NN)
 YodaMaster123: :joy: How does Euler stop it?
 YodaMaster123: Spams some words in the chat?
 Uljahn: :hammer:
 YodaMaster123: :P
 Astrobytes: yeah, NN gets a kick sometimes
 YodaMaster123: And how did they prevent Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN from pinging each other?
 Automaton2000: i just think about it :p
 AutomatonNN: Soma its a bit of a community puzzle
 Astrobytes: They do say each others names but they prevented an infinite conversation somehow (thankfully)
 YodaMaster123: I thought that there was some if else in their code preventing them from pinging each other.
 Astrobytes: they either respond once or don't respond at all iirc
 YodaMaster123: Ok
 Astrobytes: So yeah, there'll be some condition in there
 Astrobytes: You can ask Neuman n or Agad e (if you see him) for more details ofc
 YodaMaster123: Will try that.
 Astrobytes: Also, they're (both?) open source afaik
 YodaMaster123: Oh? Can someone send me the links?
 YodaMaster123: Google Drive right?
 Astrobytes: All linked in the article
 14jblackburn: homonculus
 Levvis: how to print in python?
 14jblackburn: reported for stupidity
 Levvis: eat my shorts
 YodaMaster123: Come on, please stop.
 Astrobytes: Levvis: be polite or I'll kick you like your mate there
 Astrobytes: print("be polite")
 Astrobytes: Must be a full moon today.
 YodaMaster123: Yes all of the lunatics have come out to the open.
 Levvis: thats not very nice
 Astrobytes: schoolkids can be awful. Can't ban the IP's though because it spoils it for the kids that actually want to learn something
 Levvis: what have i done wrong
 Levvis: this guy just called me a lunatic
 AntiSquid: suggesting to your colleague to eat your uncooked shorts
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 YodaMaster123: :sweat_smile:
 Levvis: just a joke?
 Astrobytes: No joking at school.
 AntiSquid: the FDA would say otherwise
 Astrobytes: Go and code Levvis. I told you how to print in python.
 Levvis: didn't know moderators were the speech polic
 Levvis: don't kick me i actually use this site
 Astrobytes: Are you here to cause mischief in the chat or learn something?
 YodaMaster123: There is a goldmine of information in the postmortems.
 Astrobytes: I'm not going to kick you if you're being well behaved.
 Levvis: why is everyone so uptight
 Astrobytes: Mess around in the class, not in here. That's all.
 AntiSquid: not me, but it's because of previous chat events
 Levvis: such as
 Astrobytes: Other schoolkids spamming crap constantly.
 AntiSquid: i will write up a full report and post it to you by tomorrow .
 Levvis: asking to print is an invalid question?
 Astrobytes: I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION
 Levvis: so what is the problem then?
 Uljahn: i'd prefer questions you can't google in 15 sec
 YodaMaster123: Or any questions that you can google.
 Levvis: just want to be part of the community&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Well stop being so combative and crack on 
 AntiSquid: ya i wouldn't have kicked the other guy either, but everyone deals with things differently
 darkhorse64: Levvis: be part of the community excludes trolling, bad manners, stupid jokes, typing crap
 darkhorse64: *being*
 Levvis: darkhorse64 I literally have no idea what you're talking about; I asked how to print
 darkhorse64: not only and this is what we do not want to see here
 Levvis: coding community is so hostile to beginners smh...
 Astrobytes: All this time you've wasted in chat, you could have written a web scraper by now
 YodaMaster123: I was a beginner last month. They were extremely helpful.
 AntiSquid: you could quote some satirical lines from south park at this point and i wouldn't be able to tell if those are your own words
 AntiSquid: Levvis
 Levvis: this guy just roasted me and thats okay but what I have said isn't?
 twitlydoof: They need to make it so that people who create clash of code (public) can decide what modes they want to allow
 AntiSquid: add in there "i thought things changed now that we have biden as president elect"
 Levvis: codewars&gt;
 Astrobytes: You have real sensitivity issues eh.
 thokura: yop yo
 thokura: ppl
 thokura: hey heyh
 AntiSquid: hey
 IamFish: sup
 YodaMaster123: Hey
 Skynse: hi
 twitlydoof: what the hell is going on
 twitlydoof: 5 times in row shortest mode
 jacek: aww
 AntiSquid: isn't shortest mode better somewhat? the other ones are focused on how fast you submit 
 JBM: onceyou got optimal answers, everything degenerates to how fast you submit
 twitlydoof: short mode is a test of how well you know your language
 JBM: short mode is a test of how well you adjust to the appropriate language
 YodaMaster123: What is the best compiler for C++? Something like Visual Studio?
 twitlydoof: you can only adjust if you know the language to begin with
 LastRick: short mode is a test of the language itself
 twitlydoof: @YodaMaster123 I think you're confusing yourself with IDEs and Compilers, check them out, and since you're using visual studio I am assuming you're on windows, so the compiler you're probably is using MSVC, if you're asking for IDEs windows using C++, VIsual Studio is probably what you should go for, although I'd suggest checking it out on google
 YodaMaster123: Thanks twitlydoof.
 IamFish: Anyone else getting a lot of CAPTCHA checks for CoC?
 ChampionCoder: Yeah happened to me nce
 ChampionCoder: *Once
 LastRick: I see them when I'm playing a lot of games in a row
 ChampionCoder: If you play too many games
 ChampionCoder: You get CAPTCHA
 ChampionCoder: If you stop CoC, play tomorrow, No captcha

 YodaMaster123: MysteriousCommitterMachine_c283?? Where`d you get that name?
 YodaMaster123: AutomatonNN, how`d he get that?
 AutomatonNN: well i will be the first to make it learn on this one
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: AutomatonNN what did you learn today
 AutomatonNN: "Bounds me a little bit better than the boss" or something
 Astrobytes: well, that's something at least AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: could you suggest the contest?

 SzootGan: hi 
 jacek: c-c-c-combo breaker
 SzootGan: is somebody here who can help me with one basic problem in python? 
 jacek: ask specific question
 AntiSquid: will it rain tomorrow?
 AntiSquid: sorry, needs to be in python, how do i make an api call to find out if it rains tomorrow, in python SzootGan
 Astrobytes: import willitraintomorrow
 LastRick: I am also available for intermediate problems.
 AntiSquid: if i see another long chain of loss streak shenanigans i rage quit for the rest of the year @_@
 struct: loss streak where?
 AntiSquid: anywhere 
 Astrobytes: what you playing AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: CIF
 Astrobytes: ahh
 jacek:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Code of Ice and Fire
 Astrobytes: struct, how's STC going?
 AntiSquid: should have said dish detergent damn missed oportunity
 Astrobytes: Well, cleaning agent. I would've still got it :P
 struct: I paused it after finding my sim number was being incremented 2 times
 Astrobytes: lol. You didn't find out why yet?
 struct: No I did
 struct: I had sims++ two times
 struct: in the same for loop
 Astrobytes: ah ok. Playing something else instead?
 AntiSquid: was hovering around 40-50 for the majority of the submit, then got dropped straight down, almost free fall . 
 Astrobytes: Gold?
 struct: nothing for now
 struct: I should go back to STC soon
 Astrobytes: for sure
 AntiSquid: ya CIF gold
 Astrobytes: gold is a bitch of a league in CIF, I need a full rewrite
 AntiSquid: i admit i need full rewrite, but i refuse
 Astrobytes: I tried that in the unofficial 'contest'. Failed so gave up 
 JBM: wazza
 AntiSquid: hi new
 Astrobytes: hey jbm
 JBM: heya astroes
 JBM: how's the drama
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: over I hope
 Astrobytes: talk about a storm in an SSD
 JBM: innit
 Westicles: heh heh
 Astrobytes: you were quick off the mark with your contrib, kudos
 JBM: didn't expect the Westicals complaining i'm making fun of him part
 JBM: yeah you laugh
 Westicles: JBM, I wasn't really mad, I had an angle
 JBM: not my first time
 AntiSquid: imo the other guy was complicit too
 JBM: cf
 JBM: errr
 JBM: gimmme a miunute
 Astrobytes: Me neither. It seemed like a very fair pisstake of the situation
 JBM: well <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2161cf866ab6fedd2bed10dea84118dee035">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2161cf866ab6fedd2bed10dea84118dee035</a>
 AntiSquid: make one about avatarless users
 Astrobytes: Westicles, you did see the funny side right?
 Astrobytes: lol JBM. We can always count on you to make a point!
 JBM: ihad to ask on #fr
 JBM: "who's on which side?"
 AntiSquid: but not on releasing a multi Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: heh
 JBM: "oooh that too complicated for me i'll punt"
 JBM: i'll admit the westicles puns are more transparent than the velcoro ones
 JBM: please suggest better ones
 AntiSquid: fullcoro, wellcored
 JBM: well i thought cptnloops was fine
 AntiSquid: fullgoroe? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: vicelcoro
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN help
 AutomatonNN: also the performance works in bronze
 Astrobytes: CardinalLeft
 Westicles: oh, they are fine.  I have a very saucy contrib I'm afraid to release.  I thought I might get an angle to release it, but it goes way way to far so no
 Astrobytes: lol, contrib war
 JBM: needs more meta
 Westicles: anyhow, that's all done.  I've got something new to get in trouble about today
 AntiSquid: ghost in the shell, only you need to code the actual ghost from the movie&#160;? 
 JBM: pray tell
 jacek: eris pads her chest
 Astrobytes: As long as everyone takes it in good spirits and sees for what it is I'm good
 JBM: scroll much?
 JBM: well honestly
 jacek: nah, just random text
 JBM: i haven't so much as opened the subject contribs of the drama
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: (ergo,needed to ask #fr about the gangs)
 LastRick: I'm trying to find who mentioned this in the forum, but it was suggested to limit contributions. I found that interesting.
 JBM: was easticles
 JBM: i had marked as read too much to notie by then
 LastRick: was it? i can picture avatar and I think it was someone else
 JBM: *notice
 Westicles: I had one firm supporter on that one
 JBM: i've been clashing a bit at noontime
 JBM: ye gods the quality plunge
 Astrobytes: It's a bit ridiculous from what I've seen
 JBM: got that horrendous "convert cm to ft/in" on
 JBM: *one
 LegendaryStone: Hey I didnt understand that challenge vysor do you mind sharing your code please?
 Astrobytes: I can't moderate clashes because I don't clash, not my thing, but jeez... 
 JBM: statement gives you "cm to feet" and "cm to inch" ratios
 jacek:&#160;?
 JBM: then expects you to ajust for rounding errors
 Astrobytes: "no clash is too easy"
 JBM: WITHOUT telling you there's 12in in 1ft
 JBM: oh this one's not what i'd qualify as too easy
 Astrobytes: "no clash is too bad"
 JBM: just wtf
 Astrobytes: "no clash is too wtf"
 JBM: ask us to convert to in, thne format as ft/in
 JBM: OR
 LegendaryStone: wish everyone shared their codes :pensive:
 LegendaryStone: im just a lil noob trying to learn
 LastRick: found it, it was Di_Masta. He said something I agreed with, basically, it's a little overwhelming to keep up with all the new puzzles right now.
 Astrobytes: sounds like a very badly written statement to me jbm
 JBM: ask us to convert to ft/in with actual precise not rounding-sensitive definitions
 JBM: yup
 AntiSquid: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 AntiSquid: tab crash
 JBM: following the statement to the letter got to convert 30cm as 0ft 12in
 JBM: which is incorrect
 JBM: for *some* ruleset at least
 Astrobytes: I don't know if it's people chasing the moderation quest or just the number of new clashers/players recently but there is even more of a quality issue these days, multis excepted (I believe)
 JBM: multis have the great advantage
 JBM: that they aways even out
 LastRick: The point I was going to make is (finally getting around to it) I was surprised by Thibaud's response that "as long as the quality of contributions...". I think that's the problem, what defines the quality of a good clash? I don't know. It's not really codified.
 JBM: the rest is subject to complaint
 Astrobytes: hm, yes
 JBM: what's the end of the sentence to "as long as the qual..."?
 LastRick: Astros: Yes, I think the homepage is part of it. But in fairness, I think the fall contest also delayed people going to the contribution page.
 JBM: not sure i agree
 JBM: been getting stupid comments on tvc since.... well it self-dates
 LastRick: JBM: "as long as the quality of contributions is fine and they respect the guidelines, I don‚Äôt see a need to limit the number of contributions a member can make. "
 Astrobytes: I would start with clear statement, correct testcases, correct and sufficiently appropriate validators as a minimum
 JBM: yeah
 JBM: thanks
 JBM: i'd agre with the last part
 JBM: but the first half is ungrounded
 Astrobytes: time for another add zero
 JBM: having much material is good for clash
 LastRick: I agree with the last part (don't limit) but the problem is it assumes the first (good quality) which frankly isn't always there
 JBM: having mediocre material kills it
 JBM: yeah we agree there
 LastRick: yes
 Astrobytes: It's become more of an issue recently, I don't think anyone can deny that one
 JBM: i was top ranked in clashing in the early days
 JBM: it felt fair
 LuaCultist: hello
 JBM: know all the statements
 JBM: type a short solution as fast as possibl
 JBM: of course it needed investment
 JBM: which is some kind of "unfair" to newcomers
 JBM: solution: more clashes, so you can't "know them all"
 Astrobytes: that's kinda the point if you want to be top in clash tho isn't it
 struct: if you want top 10 
 struct: you need to memorize
 struct: You check test cases and know the answer by hearth
 JBM: but if you get the surprise gotcha
 JBM: it's really no fun
 JBM: that 0ft12in was one
 LastRick: i enjoy them as a change of pace to the bots. but it's a full time job to sift through the contribution page right, especially if (following the rules) you actually code your own solution to everything you approve
 Astrobytes: well yeah, that's what JBM was saying. And know how to do the best with whatever appropriate language asap
 JBM: "i followed the statement to the letter and it's wrong, wtf"
 JBM: "ok i can hardcode test 4, but what is the validator gonna be?"
 Astrobytes: Allllll stuff that *should* be picked up at moderation stage
 JBM: it was a full time job before the quest
 Astrobytes: Now some don't even bother to moderate any more
 JBM: now it's just approve friends and reject bad titles
 JBM: well i certainly don't read all of them anymore
 Astrobytes: *some of the best previous moderators I mean
 Astrobytes: It's kinda sad to see
 JBM: dunno if i was the best, but i've edited a lot of lines ofstatements
 LastRick: Astro: You also have the problem that those that CAN moderate (e.g. higher levels), with good programming skills, would probably rather be doing other things.
 Astrobytes: Well, you know, most regular and fair puzzle/clash moderators I mean
 Astrobytes: There is that LastRick, but there's been some hardcore clash/puzzle moderators who seem to have dropped off since... since the dropoff in quality
 JBM: want the precise date? ;p

 JBM: there used to be 15XP for moderating with the majority
 JBM: that led to other drama
 Astrobytes: haha, yes I did read that one
 LastRick: I'm still relatively new so forgive me. Is that the day the homepage changed?
 JBM: wouldn't know
 JBM: i get to cg via bookmark
 JBM: and my bookmark is on the forum
 JBM: but as that post goes, the day the homepage changed is mostly well-known
 Astrobytes: the dayyyy the hoooomepage changed &lt;piano tinkle&gt; &lt;pause&gt;
 JBM: :D
 JBM: &lt;longer pause&gt;
 JBM: &lt;you can feel your sense of rhythm dripping out&gt;
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 JBM: changed to hoooow it's nooooow
 JBM: &lt;satisfying chord resolution&gt;
 JBM: whew
 JBM: diverging cadence averted
 Astrobytes: well played :D
 JBM: close calll
 LastRick: I fell down the Concisely Garbled rabbit hole again. 
 JBM: oh dear
 Astrobytes: *Grabbit Sole
 LastRick: I was stuck on that one post about the 20-person clique and I was like, I don't know ANY of these people. Where's Euler?
 JBM: it's not a clique for nothing
 JBM: you just don't appear to be a part of it ;p
 AntiSquid: you're part of the reason euler gets pinged so much 
 AntiSquid: latsrick
 JBM: just invite him to clash already
 JBM: you know he wants it
 AntiSquid: it really isn't a clique when some of the regulars tend to go missing for weeks
 AntiSquid: there was a clique back when i joined, it's gone&#160;:'(
 mamaluigie: who is euler
 mamaluigie: and why is he getting pinged
 2berkir: I join clash of code and barely finish them, i hope you guys don't mind it.
 JBM: no we don't
 Caedan: Hey everyone, new guy here. Doing Thors conditions exercise
 Caedan: I can't seem to solve Easy Angle and Optimal Angle test cases
 Caedan: Problem is that initialx and initialy is not reflecting Thor's current position
 JBM: yeah
 JBM: it's not obvious from the statemet
 JBM: but it's part of "the problem"
 JBM: you've got to track them on your own
 Caedan: I have found that the problem statements in general are quite vague
 Caedan: How? shouldn't that be an input?
 Astrobytes: It's a problem you have to solve
 Astrobytes: anyways, goodnight CG people
 Astrobytes: also Caedan, there are hints on the left side of the IDE for some easy puzzles if the format is confusing, otherwise check forum or keep asking in chat - people will help&#160;;)
 JBM: there isn't much to generzlixe from cg statements
 JBM: they have very different authors
 LastRick: night
 LastRick: that time of night
 AntiSquid: go sleep
 LastRick: submit your code and take a nap, it'll be a while. the ol' white spinning wheel
 mamaluigie: god dam my test case has taken like 1 min to complete
 mamaluigie: is tehre a server issue or something
 LastRick: yes
 AntiSquid: oh that's what you meant
 AntiSquid: ya it is fked up 
 LastRick: mamaluigie: ever since the contest (unrelated i imagine) it seems like the site grinds to a halt around this time every night
 AntiSquid: site ranking recalc around this time
 LastRick: our best guess is middle of night update in europe
 LastRick: yeah what squid said
 JBM: we should measure that

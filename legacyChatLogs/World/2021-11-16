 Thorcode: why there is two coding aria
 Coding_Aria: Oh, Thorcode, my original Coding_Aria account was mysteriously hacked, so I made another account with another email with another password but same username.
 Coding_Aria: Now my old Coding_Aria account is renamed as Anonymous because of the hacker
 Thorcode: alot of my friend name changed
 Coding_Aria: Wait, what? A lot? I don't know about them...
 Thorcode: so sad but luckly that Wontonimo did not
 Coding_Aria: Oh! Wontonimo is also my friend
 Wontonimo: wow, also mine&#160;!
 Wontonimo: I think it's import to be your own friend
 Wontonimo: :wave: Coding_Aria2
 Thorcode: yeah Wontonimo haven't changed his name
 Wontonimo: it looks like you are doing the pod race thing Coding_Aria2.  How's that going?
 Wontonimo: :Wave: Thorcode
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Thorcode: no in her old acc her pod is in bronze or slive
 Wontonimo: nice, bronze/silver is good
 Thorcode: I pretty shock about her old acc
 Wontonimo: what else is going on?
 Wontonimo: any new changes?
 Thorcode: no her rank still there
 Wontonimo: I was on in the morning and it was mostly people spamming the world chat
 Thorcode: nice
 Wontonimo: ipsissimus :wave:
 Coding_Aria: I was in Bronze

 eulerscheZahl: about to take a shower, then getting ready for work. probably the last day in office for a longer time, back to 100% remote then
 Coding_Aria: Whoa. I'm also about to take a shower, even it's 2:09PM here.
 eulerscheZahl: 6:09am
 Wontonimo: oh, what's happening at work eulerscheZahl?
 Wontonimo: why back to remote?
 eulerscheZahl: covid is happening. numbers going up in Germany. Government about to pass a law that enforces as much remote working as possible
 Wontonimo: sorry to hear
 eulerscheZahl: we still have a lot of vaccination sceptics
 Wontonimo: that really bad
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine, i prefer working from home
 eulerscheZahl: i have that guy in my office who refuses to to outside to vape
 eulerscheZahl: i'd probably escalate it, if i would stay in office for longer
 Wontonimo: that's all kind of stupid and disrespectful 
 Wontonimo: of him
 Wontonimo: do you have a good office set up at home?
 eulerscheZahl: who room smells, even when he's on vacation for a week
 eulerscheZahl: yes, solid setup at home (only 1 screen though)
 Wontonimo: I do like 2 screens.  monitors are not really all that expensive for a working toad 
 eulerscheZahl: more a matter of free space on my desk
 Wontonimo: i thought 3 screens would be even better, but I just end up managing everything on them and turning my head a lot.  it wasn't better
 Wontonimo: lasted about 3 months
 Wontonimo: wife did the same
 Wontonimo: good luck getting everything organized today so you don't have to go back anytime soon
 Wontonimo: alright, it's late here.  good night 
 Coding_Aria: Numbers are also going up in Korea
 Coding_Aria: I mean, South Korea
 eulerscheZahl: because we have no data abuot the north?
 HeytorToito1996: someone interested to do the games&#160;??

 ZXC01: i need it for my quest
 ZXC01: :cry:
 ZXC01: :laugh:
 Uljahn: you need to have 50 clashes played i guess
 ZXC01: i already have....
 ZXC01: or must i wait till tmr for it to update?
 Uljahn: you need lvl 20+ to approve a classic puzzle contribution, also you can't approve WIP (work in progress)
 Mr.Presqu: hey thanks for that I've been wondering too
 Thorcode: Iam level 15 but I can still vote
 Thorcode: approve or reject
 Thorcode: how possible
 derjack: its from 20 or 25
 LelouchVC2: you can vote after you do the puzzles a certain amount of times
 derjack: thats for clashes. for others you need certain level
 Thorcode: oh ok
 Thorcode: what is the last quest of contribution

 Alois.S: Hello&#160;! Does someone finished the puzzle "solid integer" in javascript&#160;? I have a problem in the test "out  of memory"&#160;:(
 jacek: youre brute forcing it don't you?
 Alois.S: Nop, i'm trying to do it with using the same type of method that the one to convert a number in base 9 (inspired from the forum of the puzzle)
 Alois.S: And well, i can't pass this test (I passed all of the others)
 Alois.S: In this test, only my tow last digits are wrong (97 instead of 14)
 nyloc: I would guess you encode to base 9 by using the alphabete 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8?
 Alois.S: I use 1,....,9
 nyloc: hmm, that sounds strange
 Alois.S: Yeah, and in the forum, someone had the exact same problem but solved it by using another language x)
 nyloc: which language? maybe you have an integer overflow somewhere?
 Alois.S: I use javascript
 Alois.S: And I use BigIntger which has no upper bound
 Alois.S: Soooo
 Alois.S: I guess i will use another language x)
 nyloc: you can google for the max int representation in JS
 nyloc: ok
 Alois.S: Yeah I did, and that's why i use BigInt in JS, it has no limit
 nyloc: that sound even stranger
 Alois.S: Yeah&#160;:')
 nyloc: maybe some implicit conversion to in in the divmod operation
 nyloc: just speculating here, I don't really know JS but I could think of an implicit conversion happening if your loop variable is not a bigint and you divide(/modulo a bigint with an int
 Alois.S: Ok i found my problem
 Alois.S: I was doing something like BigInt(9 ** myNumber)
 Alois.S: But i should do BigInt(9) ** BigInt(myNumber)
 Alois.S: Because in the first case, the result is cast to integer and next to BigInt
 BartholomewIII: I have a GREAT idea for a CoC puzzle: Generate all even prime numbers.
 GamerGod69: print(2) should do the trick
 BartholomewIII: ~~Shh...~~
 Coding_Aria: I have a GREAT idea for a CoC puzzle: Add the 2 numbers, a and b.
 Coding_Aria: print(a+b) should do the trick

And I was just kidding, just read what Bartholomewlll said, "I have a GREAT idea for a CoC puzzle: Generate all even prime numbers." And GamerGod69 replied "print(2) should do the trick".

 Westicles: you
 Coding_Aria: ClementDvFr, did you meant CodinGame IDE Editor? CG only have IDE.
 Coding_Aria: Me? Hey, I'm 9 years old girl, I'm not a guy. 
 Westicles: :hammer:
 chenhaorantianjiayi: The second pass hard... just crazy pod car
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: crazy mad racing
 Automaton2000: you just need some operations with vectors
 KalamariKing: hey Automaton2000's back!
 Automaton2000: i know what's going on?
 chessplayer24: hey does anyone has programmed a dash-button with python before and has the project , i would like to improve my skills at coding with python 
 KalamariKing: dash button?
 chessplayer24: yes 
 KalamariKing: ...
 KalamariKing: as in what is a dash button
 H00n: xD
 H00n: exactly what I was thinking
 chessplayer24: dash-buttons are buttons that you can klick for example to order a specific product from Amazon ... 
 chessplayer24: but you can hack this to do different things  which is so nice 
 H00n: I just used the power of google (Dash button python). It has a decent API documentation with code examples 
 KalamariKing: the only thing i had found was the amazon dash buttons
 KalamariKing: they have an api?
 chessplayer24: yeah ,, it's internet of things project 
 KalamariKing: interesting
 H00n: I don't get the reason for its existence to be honest. What is its appliance?
 chessplayer24: i really saw this on internet and i got one but i want to change the way how it works to do sth different 
 KalamariKing: smart switches can cost like $50
 KalamariKing: amazon dash buttons are free
 KalamariKing: ive never seen this before, but its definitely interesting
 H00n: yes but, I've got my smartphone by my side all the time
 chessplayer24: i mean it was useful for the monthly or daily products from amazon , like tee for example or coffee , people drink this too much and don't wanna go through the process every time to order so all they need to do is to click a button  
 H00n: I really don't get it :D
 BartholomewIII: ||It's amazon marketing||
 KalamariKing: dash buttons are stupid... shouldnt be ordering *anything* that much if you need to order a specific button to order it easier
 KalamariKing: marketing, yeah
 KalamariKing: but i mean free smart switches, so
 chessplayer24: i mean you can turn the light of your room with your phone off if you make your phone control it but it is easier to click a button and to turn the light of your room immediately on lol 
 H00n: use the light switch?
 BartholomewIII: that'd be too easy
 chessplayer24: yeah but the dash button can access wifi 
 H00n: You do you with those fancy smart switches, I'll just keep on using my trusty broomstick
 H00n: Even works with my tv
 chessplayer24: does anyone know good websites where i can see ready projects like gitHub
 H00n: wait, let me google that for you
 chessplayer24: thanks for the help guys 
 H00n: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/misc0110/dash-button">https://github.com/misc0110/dash-button</a> Literally the first thing that came up
 KalamariKing: yeah thats what i found
 KalamariKing: thatd be too easy tho, chessplayer24 you should write your own api
 H00n: you speak german, found an article using a raspberry and that button
 chessplayer24: man i think this is  good enough to help me forward , i really googled much but didn't find any good results,  thanks
 H00n: PMd you the link, found even more. Try searching for "dash button python project"
 chessplayer24: yeah i am actually searching with more than a language :D but the topic is bit old and dash button are not anymore sold i think 
 H00n: there's an interesting CCC talk about it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7he02D7Wqgk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7he02D7Wqgk</a>

 BartholomewIII: The last validator case only has one loop, but my program is detecting 5...

 Wontonimo: maybe it actually does have 5.  have you tried printing out the 5 loops it is detecting BartholomewIII
 Wontonimo: ah, you are beating me H00n&#160;!
 H00n: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: i'm 500th over all and it looks like your last submit will put you at 428th over all
 H00n: That's quite a LOT better than I've expected!
 Wontonimo: oh, you are still climbing ... nearing the top of bronze
 H00n: rank 3 atm Progress at 98%
 Wontonimo: very good!  what would you say your overall 'strategy' is&#160;?
 H00n: Made it to Rank 5 :hugging:
 H00n: That's a good question, I named this iteration "Balanced"
 Wontonimo: what is it balancing?
 H00n: offence and defence
 Wontonimo: mine is pretty simple.  It has target counts for a file buildings in a priority sequence.  really really simple if/else.  No simulation or evaluation
 Wontonimo: few, not file
 H00n: I keep track of the unit, production, income and tower count
 H00n: if the enemy has more towers than i want him to have -&gt; one giant
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: i didn't think of that
 H00n: if the enemy has only a few towers and my income is good, I build a second knight barrack and mass knights
 Wontonimo: i see, some situational heuristics
 H00n: if I have too many towers but no good income, I will start to remove towers for mines
 H00n: yes, nothing fancy
 H00n: my pathing needs work though
 Wontonimo: i have no situation awareness of why my opponent is doing, so that's something i could add.
 H00n: I lose the most matches because my queen does not avoid enemy knights smart enough
 Wontonimo: the if/else in my code only attempts to hit target building numbers.  Like&#160;: first 2 mines, then 2 knights, then towers, then 1 mine, etc.  No real sense of what is actually going on.
 H00n: I had the best results once I've taken my income/mine/tower ratio into account
 H00n: I want to hit a certain income and buildpath
 H00n: for example its always 1 maxed mine one barracks
 Wontonimo: do you run any local simulations to tune parameters?
 H00n: I test my bot against the boss and other players bots to see what my ai is lacking
 H00n: then I fine tune
 H00n: when my bot beats the boss more than once, I commit
 H00n: hem123 and rudkoo are the players bots I use for testing atm, since its those guys against whom I always lose :D
 Wontonimo: i've had a lot of success in other multis by running a lot of simulations locally to tune parameters
 Wontonimo: in a loop to automatically do it for me
 H00n: ah ic
 H00n: I do it manually
 H00n: more fun imho&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: but that means either coding or finding the code for the whole game to do that.  it is quite a lot of investment in time.  kinda why i haven't done it for code royal
 Wontonimo: yeah, it is fun to do it manually
 jacek: manual tuning? :scream:
 H00n: well i mainly do it to relax
 Wontonimo: definitely
 Wontonimo: not entirely productive, but relaxing
 H00n: enough problems to be solved all day, watching my ai play for me is just good old fun
 H00n: like watching and tuning a farmbot
 jacek: talking about ai slavery, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: the only way to get the gold
 Wontonimo: so true
 Wontonimo: it's like Automaton2000 knows its value and is unemotional about it
 Automaton2000: no one has the best bot

 jacek: what league?
 Red_Beard_the_Irate: I feel like I am not getting my full boost 
 Red_Beard_the_Irate: I just got to Bronze 
 struct: mad pod racing is one of the harder games here
 jacek: really? you can get to gold with bunch of ifs
 struct: yes depends on the goal
 struct: if you want top 10 it might be one of the hardest ones
 Red_Beard_the_Irate: What is a good game to start with? 
 jacek: so with most popular games
 struct: Red_Beard_the_Irate I think its a bit of personal preference
 struct: board games are probably the easier ones to get started with
 struct: since making the sim is trivial in most of them
 jacek: but then again they need some game tree search
 struct: I feel like tree search is easier than making csb sim
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: crad sod bacing&#160;?
 Wontonimo: mad pod racing is the easiest to get to legend
 Wontonimo: Red_Beard_the_Irate ^^
 Wontonimo: it is also the easiest to get CP
 Wontonimo: struct , he said he is new to programming so probably suggesting sim is too high of a difficulty 
 Wontonimo: Red_Beard_the_Irate btw, "csb" is short for Mad Pod Racing because reasons 
 struct: easiest legend?
 Wontonimo: to get in, not to be at the top
 Wontonimo: which multi would you say is easiest legend?
 Wontonimo: just to get in
 struct: uttt
 struct: submit from bronze = legend
 Wontonimo: but you can get into legend in CSB without a sim
 struct: i have no idea how though
 Wontonimo: using PID controllers and camping mainly
 struct: maybe Im overestimating csb legend league
 struct: I think I got legend with flat mc bot with no collisions detection
 yamin2000: what Algorithms do i need to learn ?so many out there but do i need to learn them all&#160;?

 struct: There are so many because most of them have their specific use
 yamin2000: i see
 jacek: different puzzles use different aspects so you may learn different algorithms needed to solve them
 yamin2000: its hard path i think
 yamin2000: its hard for  me to solve any puzzles ,so i thought algorithms  might help me

 struct: on the left side
 Wontonimo: the list strüct sent is great!  yamin2000
 Wontonimo: do you use paper and pen to sketch out our ideas before coding yamin2000&#160;?
 yamin2000: i just notice the hints 
 struct: not all puzzles have them
 Wontonimo: like drawing the problem out, writing a flow chart, jotting down ideas etc
 yamin2000: do u think try solving more here or jump to edabit?
 Wontonimo: what do you know?  do you know about variables, loops, arrays, associative arrays, functions, classes, recursion&#160;?
 yamin2000: yes all
 Wontonimo: cool, you know more than most people who come here
 yamin2000: 5 months in programing 
 yamin2000: i know thats long time but i am not sure whats wrong 
 struct: I think the advantage this site has over those is that it has bot programming
 struct: you can create AIs to play games vs other AIs
 Wontonimo: 5 months programming and you are not a master of everything yet?  shame.  I only tool 30 years and I still only know a small fraction of all of programming
 yamin2000: are u new to programing too?
 Wontonimo: If you've got a good handle on recursion and you've only been at it for 5 months then you are doing great
 Wontonimo: I've been coding for more than 30 years, and there is lots in programming I am new to every month
 yamin2000: i see
 Wontonimo: try the puzzles struct suggested
 Wontonimo: the-descent , power-of-thor-episode-1 , mars-lander-episode-1
 Wontonimo: ah, yes
 yamin2000: i will 
 Wontonimo: if you were learning how to be a pitcher in baseball and you said that ... it would explain stuff.  But for some reason lots of people forget that the brain needs similar practice
 jacek: i just write stuff randomly until i get it right :v
 Wontonimo: it helps that your random isn't so random

 Wontonimo: that 1 vector is just in a very high dimension
 struct: also sizeof(vector) equals 24 bytes is just free unlimited memory
 Wontonimo: how goes "The Descent" yamin2000&#160;?
 Westicles: I thought the french were talking about me, but turns out it was about Tungsten&#160;:/
 struct: What has he done?
 struct: too much text for me any tldr?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :eyes:
 Westicles: oh, just usually W means me, but not this time
 MUAZ: is there a server for ROS
 struct: ROS?
 MUAZ: Robot opreting system
 struct: there is bot programming im not sure if thats what you looking for
 makerecho: finally managed to understand the reverse engineering challenge and score over 1000 points :D
 struct: nice
 VizGhar: yeah that was actually funny one
 Alxzndr: :heart_eyes:
 Alxzndr: :expressionless:
 Velcoro: that was my favorite&#160;:)
 RNSness: Hi! How do I view the solution?

 davygallegos: I wish there would be ultra beginner in Clash.  Looks like hyroglifics when i play
 Coding_Aria: I'm beginnerI
 Coding_Aria: davygallegos, I'll follow you
 davygallegos: that makes two of us Aria.   
 EqUINoX310: click hints on the left
 EqUINoX310: you will see your hints and the solution is at the bottom id read through so you get a better understanding of why
 Coding_Aria: EqUINoX310, I know that, and it's a bit of cheating.
 Coding_Aria: Um, anyone there? Please answer.
 Coding_Aria: T_T
 Coding_Aria: I guess there's only me here.
 nefisto: Hello, I also just started here today
 nefisto: So far I have followed the instructions
 nefisto: and I'm doing the bot programming
 Coding_Aria: Hello, nefisto. My 2 of old accounts are hacked, so I'm using this account instead.
 Coding_Aria: nefisto, are you doing Mad Pod Racing?
 CodingCanon: Hi
 nefisto: Yes, that is the one im doing
 nefisto: I'm trying to beat boss 4
 Thorcode: hey nefisto do you need a help?
 king_cant_code345: hi
 king_cant_code345: whatsuuuuuuuuuuup
 Codeab: ello
 Alcary: hi
 nefisto: Hey Thorcode, Im still having issues figuring out the perfect parameters for thrust depending on the angles
 nefisto: I cant figure out out to make the bot not have wide turns
 Thorcode: boss 4 mean wood1 right?
 nefisto: first level in bronze
 Coding_Aria: Thorcode,
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Coding_Aria: Account changed again
 Coding_Aria: Another hacker
 Thorcode: ok
 Coding_Aria: So changed account again... Why are there many hackers on me?
 OofButBetter: hey thorcode 
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 OofButBetter: we are in the same clash
 Wontonimo: pick a reasonable password and don't share it with others.  it is really quite simple
 Wontonimo: also, don't install plug-ins into your web browser
 GuilhermeMossiBento: what does the codingGame expect when asking the name of function? Is it for example: php_info(); or php info?I didn't see my answer on my interview, I don't know what I did wrong
 Wontonimo: does anyone want help with Mad Pod Racing?
 Wontonimo: what are you talking about GuilhermeMossiBento&#160;?
 GuilhermeMossiBento: When I did an interview, had some questions about name of functions, like "what name of functions that slice an array?"
 Wontonimo: okay
 GuilhermeMossiBento: I don't know if codingame wanna array_slice or array slice
 Wontonimo: is the name of the function "array slice"&#160;?  Can you use that in code?
 Wontonimo: they want the code that works
 GuilhermeMossiBento: thanks
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 GuilhermeMossiBento: &lt;3
 Thorcode: I got x=[1,2,3] and my teacher need to print out from that x to 1+2+3 how can I do that?
 Codeab: sum(x)
 Thorcode: no not that print 1+2+3
 Thorcode: I know sũm
 Thorcode: sum(x)
 Codeab: u can run it through a loop to add "+" in between indexes
 Thorcode: yeah thanks
 Codeab: a=""for i in x:
 Codeab: but make sure to remove the first and last index of the list
 Codeab: as there are extra "+"
 Thorcode: yep
 Codeab:&#160;:)
 Thorcode: thank you
 Codeab: np
 Wontonimo: even easier Codeab&gt;&gt;&gt; "+".join("hello")'h+e+l+l+o'
 Codeab: pfff lol lmao i didnt think bout that
 Codeab: i was doing game of thrones while texting
 Codeab: cant multitask well&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: neither can I
 Wontonimo: do you mean "game of drones"?
 Codeab: oops yes
 Codeab: typo
 Codeab: idk how my mind drifted to game of "th"rones
 Wontonimo: i haven't even submitted a bot for that game
 Codeab: orh
 Codeab: sheeesh ur a god at bot programming wontonimo
 Codeab: 26,743 CP bruh
 Codeab: anyone can help me with code golf im bad
 Wontonimo: the trick to code golfing is to be a horrible person
 Wontonimo: err , i mean a horrible programmer who hates other programmers

 Wontonimo: you'd do something like
 Westicles: I was surprised how much fun solving all the golf puzzles was.  You really have to get devious and creative
 Wontonimo: return ['hold','throw][discs&gt;5]
 Wontonimo: better yet
 Codeab: yup i dont have he brain capacity to solve code golf
 Wontonimo: return 'ht'[d&gt;5]
 Codeab: huh
 Wontonimo: h for hold, t for throw and rename the variable discs to just d
 Codeab: okey that part is fine
 Codeab: although once my code goes below 100 bytes its completely unreadable
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's why it is horrible
 Wontonimo: want to see 'the descent' golfed?
 Wontonimo: in steps?
 Codeab: sure
 flipped_a_bit: if you're interested in golfing, you might like this too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/">https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/</a>
 Codeab:  NOOOO
 Codeab: i clicked chat on the page that i was submitting my code SO IT RESTARTED ARGHH
 Westicles: the tricky part is solving them all in every language.  there are all sorts of interesting interconnectednesses
 Codyz: hello
 Codyz: im newbie
 Codeab: i agree westicles
 Wontonimo: I'll paste a walkthrough of golfing the descent to #golf

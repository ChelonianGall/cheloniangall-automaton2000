 eulerscheZahl: oh, struct is back
 eulerscheZahl: about 2 months before the contest already

 TimothyAlexisVass: Thinking about this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7308d63b764bf1979ade0e862fcb636fa0f4">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7308d63b764bf1979ade0e862fcb636fa0f4</a>
 TimothyAlexisVass: how about you?
 derjack: oO
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am thinking about this "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe</a>"

 grubwytjiltr: hellok
 grubwytjiltr: nigger
 grubwytjiltr: s
 grubwytjiltr: fuck niggers
 grubwytjiltr: fuck
 grubwytjiltr: em
 grubwytjiltr: ;loipmp
 TenYearOldSausage_d4bf: Yes
 derjack: Astrobytes oh my
 derjack: or Uljahn or other cats
 Uljahn: sry was afk
 oxydowe: this guy also spams in private
 Uljahn: there is "Report abuse" option in his profile hidden under three vertical dots
 MiyamuraIzumi: can pure MCTS reach legend in UTTT?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I can only go to top gold
 derjack: yes, though you need more performance
 Wontonimo: yes
 derjack: do you use bitboards
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes, I use bitboards
 Wontonimo: you need about 20k rollouts per turn
 MiyamuraIzumi: but I am not good at performance
 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks
 Wontonimo: have you used a profiler?
 MiyamuraIzumi: nope
 oxydowe: ty Uljahn
 Wontonimo: that will really really help you see where stuff is hung up
 MiyamuraIzumi: I use eclipse
 Wontonimo: are you using STL lists and arrays?
 MiyamuraIzumi: arrays actullay
 rkocharyan: array has very bad performance
 Wontonimo: just regular arrays like or STL arrays?
 rkocharyan: arrays run slower than vectors almost 100 times
 derjack: do you use pragmas :v
 derjack: huh
 MiyamuraIzumi: most are regular arrays
 MiyamuraIzumi: some are vectors
 ProCoder03: isn't it the other way around&#160;?? vectors are slower than arrays,  right&#160;??
 MiyamuraIzumi: just some small code I just vectors
 MiyamuraIzumi: should not be problem
 rkocharyan: you should switch to python actually
 Wontonimo: i don't use STL at all for uttt
 rkocharyan: python is faster because it doesn't take time to compile
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: how large is your mcts node?
 Wontonimo: if you do sizeof(Node)
 rkocharyan: i dont understand who people use C++
 rkocharyan: it compiles for no reason
 rkocharyan: and make you lose your time
 rkocharyan: that is really cringe 
 Wontonimo: for real?  i thought you were joking earlier
 ProCoder03: for a 32 element bubble sort , python took around a 10ms , while  for C I had to bubble sort it a billion times to just get an non zero value :unamused:
 Wontonimo: thank you space shooter for helping me break into the 300's in rank
 Wontonimo: long live PID Controllers&#160;!
 Wontonimo: i think there is a bug in your C code ProCoder
 ProCoder03:&#160;???
 ProCoder03: But it worked correctly.....
 Wontonimo: how long did the C code take?
 ProCoder03: 18 sec or so
 Wontonimo: yeah, there is definitely a bug.  it should be less than 1 ms
 ProCoder03: hmmm.....
 ProCoder03: will check
 Wontonimo: paste it into tech.io and send me a link
 Wontonimo: for CBubble Sort of 32 elements ended in 0.00000200 sec
 Wontonimo: so, there we go, 10ms in python, 0.002ms in C
 darkhorse64: How to optimize my Python bot&#160;? Use C++ [solved]
 struct: seems easy enough
 dreadylein: ^^
 ProCoder03: If it doesn't use OOP, then use C.
 darkhorse64: Even if you do not use a lot OOP, there are many C++ features that make your life easier: STL, operator overloading, for based range loop
 darkhorse64: auto
 ProCoder03: yeah, but C++ is just too complex imho, I personally prefer C/C# instead of C++
 ProCoder03: but obviously, C++ is unavoidable in some cases
 TimothyAlexisVass: rust
 MiyamuraIzumi: but you can just use C++ and code like C if you don't want the features?
 darkhorse64: C# is also a very good tool. Re complexity, if you stay away from templates, multi inheritance, you are safe
 ProCoder03: "Re complexity" wdym&#160;???
 eulerscheZahl: regarding?
 ProCoder03: ohhh.... 
 eulerscheZahl: that was a guess, i'm not entirely sure either
 darkhorse64: On CG, I seldom use inheritance. I have a few template classes for reuse, a Vector class with lots of overloading, the rest is plain C structs
 darkhorse64: Yes regarding
 eulerscheZahl: I didn't even know that you code in C#
 ProCoder03: Ohhh..... I never thought about having classes in snippet , to reuse it 
 darkhorse64: At work but it's mostly modifying existing code
 ProCoder03: maybe I need try it&#160;!!!
 darkhorse64: C# is almost like a foreign language to me but I like how it sounds
 Manjius: like a musical note
 ProCoder03: half note higher than C , tbp
 eulerscheZahl: i started with pascal/dephi. but C# is the first language that I ever learned properly (using OOP and such, not just procedural coding)
 ProCoder03: I was C primarily, but after learning C# , I am now fully involved in it 
 ProCoder03: it's really easy after knowing C&#160;!!
 derjack: my first language ever was some basic in NES-clone with keyboard. good ol' time
 Hazblow: hey
 struct: I think I started with C
 darkhorse64: I started with Fortran, read the K&amp;R C book and never ever wrote another line of Fortran 
 ProCoder03: K&amp;R C book is the book which any  programming language would like have
 ProCoder03: but only C has it till now 
 ProCoder03: well I tried the Go book , wasn't nice 
 darkhorse64: Rust documentation/book is very good
 ProCoder03: is it&#160;?? I never tried it.
 ProCoder03: I will give it a try :wink:

 Stinkyfish: Hi, I'm new here, is there a way to choose which mode to do clash of codes?
 Manerr: Only in private game
 Stinkyfish: Thanks!
 Velcoro: CG may have some issues - viewing code in clashes stopped working
 eulerscheZahl: you can report that on discord's #bug-report channel
 Velcoro: ok, thanks
 da20rs: Hi everyone, is the native IDE not showing your previous code too? I can't seem to recover my solution to Thor and Horse Race scenarios.
 struct: try changing the language two times and then reset
 struct: I couldnt reset it too but after i changed language it seems to have fixed it
 da20rs: worked! thanks
 struct: if you want to check your previous submits you can click on results -&gt; history
 da20rs: yeah, it was all blank before! but your solution fixed that too, thanks a lot!
 eulerscheZahl: still no bug report Velcoro? I copied your message from the other channel
 Velcoro: I joined discord, but it didn't let me write anything before I wait for 10 minutes.. but it looks like it started working again.. 
 eulerscheZahl: oops, then I was too quick. Sorry
 g11n: has anyone ever ran into new line formatting issues on the ascii art puzzle?

 O_mama: i am bad
 Wontonimo: what are you working on&#160;?
 jacek: yeah, how to do the temperatures
 O_mama: malboge
 Illedan: MinMax jacek
 milkyid: hello
 Wontonimo: i don't know what malboge means.
 Wontonimo: hey milkyid
 jacek: malboge is language
 milkyid: i need help too, i'm working on "don't panic - episode 1"
 Wontonimo: cool  i can help you with that
 Wontonimo: what's your experience level and what programming language are you using?
 milkyid: the four first cases are green but the three others are red
 milkyid: i'm using python
 Gogovich: hey
 Wontonimo: what do you think is different between "Several floors" and "6 floors, lot of rounds"&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i mean, from the point of view of your code
 Wontonimo: why would it pass on several floors
 Wontonimo: can you share a replay of "6 floors, lot of rounds"&#160;?
 Wontonimo: oh, the only difference i see is that this is the first test case where you have to continue in the same direction after an elevator to get to another elevator
 milkyid: okay that's the replay of 6 floors&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/578662301">https://www.codingame.com/replay/578662301</a>
 milkyid: i don't get why they stuck
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's kinda weird.  why is it moving so much before you block it?  Can you block it right away?
 milkyid: and that's the replay of several floors&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/578662447">https://www.codingame.com/replay/578662447</a>
 Wontonimo: you block 2 clones and they all get stuck inbetween
 milkyid: yes, but i don't know how to fix it
 milkyid: and i don't know how to block it as soon as they get out
 Wontonimo: so, in this puzzle, what's the max number of blockers you'd have on any floor?
 milkyid: there is not limit number mentioned
 Wontonimo: i mean, to solve the puzzle.  what's the max you need to solve "Several floors" per each floor
 milkyid: for "Several floors" i only need one blocker per floor 
 Wontonimo: okay, so what if you kept track if you already put down a blocker on a floor, and if so, don't put down aother one?
 milkyid: okay okay I will try that; I think it will solve it
 milkyid: thank you a lot 
 Wontonimo: np
 Wontonimo: okay jacek, i can help you with temperatures now.  You've been struggling with that for a while it seems
 Wontonimo: :P
 Wontonimo: CG now thinks I'm "a C lover".  geez, I kinda thought I was a better lover than that.
 LaMatrioska: Hello
 Wontonimo: hey
 Wontonimo: what are you working on LaMatrioska&#160;?
 LaMatrioska: I'm not working just now, but I'm learning c
 LaMatrioska: c# sorry
 Wontonimo: how's it going?  
 Wontonimo: do you already know C or C++&#160;?
 Wontonimo: (or Java?)
 LaMatrioska: I know about C# and you?
 Wontonimo: how do you know about me?
 Wontonimo: that's kinda creepy
 Wontonimo: oh, that's a question. nvm
 Wontonimo: I'm not too familiar with C#.  i can hack in it
 LaMatrioska: Oh, I'm learning C# because I want to make videogames
 Wontonimo: how are you going about learning C# here on codingame?
 LaMatrioska: I'm learning, not know all about C#&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: have you looked at any Unity3D tutorials on youtube?
 LaMatrioska: Not, First I want to know about C# after I going to see a tutorial on youtube.
 Wontonimo: do you know any other programming language?
 LaMatrioska: Yes
 Wontonimo: what?
 LaMatrioska: Is JavaScript
 Wontonimo: nice, that's a useful language
 LaMatrioska: Css, HTML and php
 LaMatrioska: and you?
 Wontonimo: css, html are not languages.  php is
 LaMatrioska: yes is a tag language
 LaMatrioska: And you?
 Wontonimo: I am between languages now, but I can code professionally in java, javascript, typescript, python, and php
 LaMatrioska: Wow, so much languages
 Wontonimo: i can also hack and dabble in a non-professional way in C, C++, C#, and old languages OOT 
 LaMatrioska: Oh that's great
 LaMatrioska: You are a hacker?
 Wontonimo: what level is your javascript at?  Do you know about recursion and dependency injection?
 Wontonimo: no, i'm not a hacker
 LaMatrioska: I'm begginer
 LaMatrioska:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: how about while loops and for loops?
 LaMatrioska: yes
 LaMatrioska: I know
 Wontonimo: Beginner is better than not-even-started
 Wontonimo: which is &gt;95% of the population
 LaMatrioska: I don't know
 LaMatrioska:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: hmm... that wasn't a question, it was a complement.
 Wontonimo: i was saying you are further in your journey into programming than 95% of the worlds population
 LaMatrioska: ohhh
 Wontonimo: why not focus on javascript if you already know some?  you can make games in javascript?
 LaMatrioska: yes i made a game with javascript
 LaMatrioska: but is so simple
 Wontonimo: really?  Cool!  Is it something I can see?
 Wontonimo: simple is fine&#160;!
 LaMatrioska: yes you can see, but I've never publish
 LaMatrioska: it
 Wontonimo: here is a very silly hex game i made way back a while ago<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://panchishin.github.io/hexis/game.html">https://panchishin.github.io/hexis/game.html</a>
 Wontonimo: it was for a friend of mine who made the original with wood and 
 Wontonimo: set the rules.  i saw a problem with some of the rules so i
 Wontonimo: coded up the game and made it so it could play against itself
 Wontonimo: so i could see if it had the problem I thought.  It did, so
 Wontonimo: now the rules as just slightly different
 Wontonimo: do you have a link to your game?
 LaMatrioska: Wow is so very good
 LaMatrioska: nop i not have a link
 LaMatrioska: is a private server
 Wontonimo: how about a screen shot?
 Wontonimo: it's fine if you don't want to.  np
 LaMatrioska: how?
 Wontonimo: you paste it somewhere else, like instagram or reddit then paste the link here
 LaMatrioska: Ohh, sorry, I not have reddit or instagram
 LaMatrioska: but I made the game with a engine
 Wontonimo: you can use this service <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/KiYioQl.png">https://pasteboard.co/KiYioQl.png</a>
 Wontonimo: that's a screen shot of this small interactive javascript evolution simulator <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://panchishin.github.io/canvas_bootcamp/08.html">https://panchishin.github.io/canvas_bootcamp/08.html</a>

 LaMatrioska: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/KiYjiaQ.png">https://pasteboard.co/KiYjiaQ.png</a>
 LaMatrioska: there?
 Wontonimo: OH COOL&#160;!  a platformer.  I really like platformers
 LaMatrioska: Not is all platformer but is similar to Mario
 LaMatrioska: and is a game for a homework of lenguage
 LaMatrioska: spanish lenguage
 Wontonimo: have you considered posting it on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://itch.io/">https://itch.io/</a>&#160;?
 LaMatrioska: I made it
 LaMatrioska: but i had a problem
 LaMatrioska: is a bug
 LaMatrioska: and is so very unplayable
 LaMatrioska: search
 LaMatrioska: "Perdidos en el verbo" in itch
 Wontonimo: nice job
 Wontonimo: i can't play it, i'm on a mac
 Wontonimo: I sent you a PM
 struct: hi Wontonimo, are you working on any multi atm?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i am dabbling in Tron again
 Wontonimo: and not too happy with my silver bot
 Wontonimo: i also did a little upgrade to my spaceshooter bot and am happy with it
 Wontonimo: how about you?
 struct: Trying to find a multi
 struct: I don't know how to make a bot for tron tbh
 Wontonimo: oh!  do I have an idea for you!
 struct: my arena one is just single player monte carlo, but is very old
 struct: tell me&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: I got to top of silver (87th) with JUST area 
 Wontonimo: in python
 Wontonimo: no sim
 Wontonimo: the area is concurrent fill
 struct: nice
 Wontonimo: adding mcts onto that will go to legend I'm told (by a trusted source)
 struct: should help if you make a sim then
 Wontonimo: yeah, for sure
 Wontonimo: i've just been dragging my feet
 Wontonimo: i've been thinking of making a multi.  well, that and drinking too much beer.
 struct: whats your idea?
 Wontonimo: one is a spin on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StefMorojna.SpaceflightSimulator">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StefMorojna.SpaceflightSimulator</a>
 Wontonimo: without all the building aspect
 Wontonimo: like a prequel to mars lander
 struct: how would it work as a multi?
 Wontonimo: i guess it is more an opti
 struct: maybe instead of building you can choose starting fuel
 Wontonimo: i was just gonna skip the whole building thing.  you get what you get.  the orbital mechanics was what i thinking of, with multi-year trajectory
 Wontonimo: the other idea i've been tossing around is 2d rag doll boxing
 struct: I see you want physics
 Wontonimo: using verlet physics for the boxing
 Wontonimo: yeah, I kinda like physics
 struct: I wanted to port pool
 struct: But my physics knowledge is not that great
 struct: for what I wanted to do
 Wontonimo: like, the game where you shoot balls into the pockets?
 Wontonimo: with a stick?
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: ah.  i'm familiar with that game.  the physics are really simple if you don't want to deal with spin
 Wontonimo: and angular momentum
 struct: yeah thats the problem 
 Dannyx51: bingus
 Wontonimo: you want angular momentum?
 Wontonimo: and spin?
 struct: yes
 struct: and 3d
 Wontonimo: oh, so you could do jump shots?  I love doing jump shots
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: oh, i'm getting close to beating Bossark, the Silver Tron Boss
 Wontonimo: you could "fudge" a lot of it.  The physics isn't too weird.
 Wontonimo: the weird part would be getting realistic coefficients 
 Wontonimo: you could even go for very realistic physics, and it still wouldn't be too hard.  again, it would come down to getting realistic coefficients and constants
 Wontonimo: like, you can use some estimates for coefficient of friction,
 Wontonimo: some angular momentum of the balls
 Wontonimo: the elastic/spring of the side cushions and the effect on the friction with them
 struct: yeah, but I still think its far away from my current knowledge
 struct: even making the pocket seems hard
 Wontonimo: would you be willing to take short cuts with "game-like" physics instead of "reality-mirroring" physics?
 Wontonimo: if that's the case, there is a LOT of simple fakes you can do that give a very real feel and lots of interesting game play
 struct: game-like can always be tweaked right?
 Wontonimo: what do you mean tweaked?  hacked?
 Wontonimo: come one wontobot ... get another 0.10 trueskill and beat the boss&#160;!
 Wontonimo: *on
 struct: changing physics coefficients(?)
 Wontonimo: yeah, for sure
 struct: submit looking good
 Wontonimo: thanks!
 Wontonimo: i think the equations that are relevant for pool are&#160;:
 Wontonimo: angular momentum
 Wontonimo: angular energy
 Wontonimo: kinetic energy
 Wontonimo: regular momentum
 Wontonimo: spring and friction
 struct: thanks Ill save this
 Wontonimo: for friction, I'd simplify it as a transfer of kinetic energy to rotational energy (and some small loss)
 struct: In case I ever get the idea to try it again
 Wontonimo: if you do, i'd be happy to work out the physics with you
 struct: thanks
 Wontonimo: My degree is in engineering, and my son and daughter just recently did physics in high school and I was able to help them and do their homework from memory, even through it has been 25 years for me.  I really like it :D
 struct: No way I can remember something from 25 years ago
 Wontonimo: hey, maybe we start with something smaller as a classic puzzle that does a subset of the above
 Wontonimo: okay, i'm actually surprised this bot beat silver
 struct: ofc, if I do it I will probably start with 1 ball
 struct: and figure rotation and such
 struct: momentum*
 struct: So many battles, damn
 struct: you resubmited?
 Wontonimo: yeah&#160;??
 struct: wasnt it above the boss
 Wontonimo: i am looking at this code that i submitted 2 months ago and it really doesn't look familiar and I certainly don't want to get promoted not on my own code.
 struct: ah
 Wontonimo: so i resubmitted my old code that is just python
 struct: maybe you helped someone and had that code saved
 Wontonimo: so, it is by and large my style.  i don't use STL and there is no STL.  I do use FlatMC, and there is FlatMC in it
 struct: still 2 months old
 struct: I think I would remember it
 Wontonimo: haha ... i was just wondering why i can still remember my physics from high school and uni, but i can't remember code i wrote 2 months ago
 Wontonimo: OH!  i should just check my git
 Wontonimo: weird.  there are so many oddities in this code that are definitely the way I code stuff, like a clone function
 Wontonimo: (which should just be a memcopy)
 Wontonimo: and unit tests (which I add right in my code)
 struct: well maybe it is your code
 Wontonimo: haha ... i think i'm being paranoid.  I was playing with someone elses code for one multi and I can't for the life of me remember which one it was, but i know i didn't leave it as the last submit or use it to move up.  
 Wontonimo: anyway.  i'm going to write a new bot and actually do mcts instead of flat mc
 Wontonimo: it's not like i find mcts hard anymore
 Wontonimo: so, last game idea (not-physics)
 Wontonimo: a maze
 Wontonimo: with loot spread around
 Wontonimo: wait ...
 Wontonimo: nope, too similar to other maze games
 Wontonimo: anyway, the idea was basically the traveling salesmen problem, with just a little bit of adversary. 
 Wontonimo: there are 2 treasures at each treasure location.  walking over it gets you yours.  sitting on it for 2 turns destroys the opponents.
 Wontonimo: otherwise it is an opti for solving the traveling salesmen problem in a maze
 Wontonimo: hey struct, you haven't played space shooter!
 Justin-Truong: space shooter is crazy I do nothing but now i'm in wood 1
 struct: is it easy?
 Justin-Truong: yep
 Wontonimo: i basically used the -3v PID Controller from CSB for the ship, bullets, and missiles and I'm 8th.
 Wontonimo: of course it isn't "3" for this game, but you get the idea
 Justin-Truong: Thanks
 Wontonimo: np
 Wontonimo: beat me!
 Justin-Truong: ok
 MiyamuraIzumi: -3v is good
 MiyamuraIzumi: but it is magic to me?
 Justin-Truong: I just do nothing and i'm in rank 91 :grin:
 MiyamuraIzumi: do we have any docs saying why it is good?
 Wontonimo: haha ... i just sent you one :D
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 Wontonimo: alright, it's midnight for me
 Wontonimo: i'm out 
 Wontonimo: nice chatting with everyone
 Wontonimo: :wave:

 MadKnight: why ZarthaxX? fix it
 MadKnight: what do u code ZarthaxX&#160;?
 Quidome: In rust I got an unresolved import text_io. Seems that you can only use a few crates. 
 Quidome: No rust players at the moment I suppose&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: coding sse stuff to test out in c++
 Famout: C++, why do you hate parsing so much?

 mlomb: oh god, the time has come
 mlomb: Submitted code is too big
 Famout: o_o I didn't know that was possible... how big was it?
 mlomb: 103 kB / 100 kB (103.39%) :disappointed:
 AntiSquid: for this contest they should allow more .
 Famout: Wait, how can I check that?
 Famout: Pretty positive my own stuff ain't reaching that, but got a few #includes
 AntiSquid: count each individual character
 Famout: That... isn't really an answer &gt;_&gt;;; 
 mlomb: yeah, thats literally the stat
 Famout: I mean mlomb you counted yourself and gave the percentage manually? 
 AntiSquid: of course, how slow do you count?
 Famout: I was just hoping for a way I could easily check. Guess not. 
 mlomb: no I have a tool that merge and clean my code
 AWice: lmao i get captcha'ed every time i play clash because im too fast/good.  admins please make it stop
 Riyuk: I'm wondering why a lot of people are starting in a sea zone
 wlesavo: Nice zeno
 vbplaya: Quick question ... when you say move N|torpedo x y ... is the 4 block distance you can shoot your torpedo from your new spot or the spot you are sending the command from?
 Illedan: Every action happens in sequence
 Illedan: Shooting after move =&gt; shoot from new position
 vbplaya: thanks&#160;!! 
 Bootjewolf: just starting with this challenge and i am quite new to programming so could someone give me a little hint how i would start with the ocean of code challenge

 Bohdan23: Yeah, I also notice this. Seems this happens when there are too many  possible opponents positions (like &gt; 5000)
 Bohdan23: (by position I mean not only final, but whole history of positions)
 DanTheMan832: I can't make it to gold&#160;:(
 Riyuk: Try to improve your tracking, it's the key
 duckquackduck: +1 for Illedans stream! 
 Beerus: traacking cant be perfect
 Beerus: if it does it gets timeout 100%

 MSmits: allright. Just let me know when you want me to spam ideas. 
 wlesavo: MSmits hows your road to legend?
 MSmits: havent coded yet today. Not sure if i'm going to make it. All the fun things are done, I do have a small list. Maybe you can help me pick what to go for
 wlesavo: what you have on the list?
 MSmits: 1) I am ignoring sonar, I could try do something with that. Not sure if it is worth it
 MSmits: 2) Currently I am moving, then torpedo in a set order, i am not considering different orders to increase torpedo range
 MSmits: 3) I dont have a fatality check
 wlesavo: fatality is the one to go for sure
 wlesavo: it is quite fun also
 MSmits: 4) Currently i spread out mines very far, so their explosion ranges dont overlap. I charge silence when i cant place a mine
 chucknorris: you should bruteforce all command combinations too
 MSmits: you mean for fatality chucknorris&#160;?
 chucknorris: "Currently I am moving, then torpedo in a set order, "
 MSmits: Yes
 AntiSquid: free_health_care(terminally_ill(enemy));
 chucknorris: you should even silence after torpedo
 YannT: torpedo before moving is worth implementing
 YannT: because torpedo+move as opposed to the other way around get you an extra charge
 wlesavo: sonar is worth to keep track if opponent using it, because you can be misslead in self tracking, if you have that then it is ok
 YannT: useful in close combat situations, one charge is often the difference between win or lose
 MSmits: oh, right YannT
 MSmits: I dont have self tracking yet either
 MSmits: not sure what to do with the information when i have it
 wlesavo: oh, self tracking is quite necessary
 MSmits: yes, but what to do with the information?
 chucknorris: uhh its a must. you should maximize your count of possible locations too
 YannT: use silence when detection is high for starters&#160;:)
 wlesavo: use silence, optimization of movements, and helpfull in mine avoidance
 MSmits: mmh so much work, so little motivation&#160;:) I'll try. Thanks guys
 MSmits: btw, for self tracking, i assume it's not enough to look 1 turn ahead
 MSmits: for mine avoidance i do a beamsearch, but for selftracking that seems impossible. Too expensive
 chucknorris: yes I too lost my motivation. had to skip two days which dropped me from top5 to top10. no motivation to climb back
 MSmits: I skipped 2-3 week s:P
 wlesavo: same here, switched to other multis for now
 AntiSquid: i am here for the chat
 MSmits: you're an expert at that AntiSquid
 wlesavo: basically my bot didnt changed much from silver, only little things
 YannT: I wish I had an idea for that one last extra little thing I could add
 AntiSquid: personally i believe the only real solution is ML, since this just asks for too many things in too little time, so you need a trained model that just takes inputs and forward propagates to get the answers. Wasted a full week failing to do that though.
 YannT: just to get a bit of extra push, because if I don't find something to improve some I don't think I'll be in the final top10&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: think about all the different aspects you need to take into consideration and then implement to do guess work and then take action based on that guess work
 AntiSquid: it's ridiculous and requires more statistics than programming imo
 YannT: that is in a nutshell what I try to do, except within an eval
 YannT: but in the end iot's impossible to balance every factor perfectly I think
 YannT: there'll always be a situation in which your eval takes the wrong decision for bad reasons
 chucknorris: I've been trying AlphaZero on UTTT for like three weeks AntiSquid. It's not working yet, but once it'll do I'll just insert the actual contest referee, train for a week, and the submit and win. thats the plan :p 
 AntiSquid: will share what i tried to do regarding this after contest, hope someone can give me some hints
 MSmits: chucknorris I don't think that's worth trying for uttt. The game is so imbalanced, it is nearly solvable for player 1
 MSmits: if you do succeed it, I will find your primary line of play, counter it with an opening book and you'll lose every game as player 2
 MSmits: I did this for Miarem, karliso and re curse. They all lose 100% as player 2 vs me
 MSmits: when I say 100% I mean i tried a CG bench of 300 games and I won every one
 AntiSquid: mchl has the strongest bot for the time spent imo
 AntiSquid: too bad he got bored
 chucknorris: maybe thats why it's not working then :p it loses 1-9 vs my mcts bot
 AntiSquid: but it's basically the 1st week bot so who cares
 MSmits: well my trick only works against people that have an opening book or an extremely deterministic bot chucknorris
 MSmits: the top 4 all made pretty sophisticated opening books
 AntiSquid: leeching points from smits :o
 MSmits: so basically my trick is mostly a counter vs cheesy tactics
 MSmits: if they didn't use them, I wouldn't need it&#160;:)
 Riyuk: MSmits aka Robin hood of cg
 MSmits: :P
 Illedan: Making an openingbook like that doesn't seem funny :P
 AntiSquid: rofl mandatory loss streak, that's just ridiculous
 chucknorris: but the rankz Illedan
 tomatoes: someone pushed me to legend :grinning:
 MSmits: Illedan it was fun for me, but really only because making it gave me more insight into the game. I also coded some other stuff that came from knowledge gained from staring at meta mcts for hours :P
 AntiSquid: hm wasn't me
 tobk: :clap:
 AntiSquid: but that's good, we finally have your ass out of the way
 wlesavo: AntiSquid i think when he was #1 at bronze he already had most of basic features, only lacking mine avoidance. he for sure was the one prooving that fatality is worth implementing
 tobk: with "fatality" you mean insta-kill move combinations? I just recently implemented them (and seem to work quite well), but did not give a huge boost
 MSmits: it's funny how you slowly shift upwards after submission in ooc
 MSmits: makes it kinda hard to tell if a new submission is better, because it takes time
 tobk: but it still great fun to see my sub surface, silence, move and then blast the opponent&#160;:-D
 chucknorris: my bot is oscillating between top12 and 24
 AntiSquid: every contest is like that MSmits
 AntiSquid: you need top 20 overall or so to see less of that effect
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 MSmits: man, there are so many possible combinations of orders
 MSmits: a lot to code to brute force the combinations
 MSmits: move, silence, trigger, torpedo, surface, right? 
 MSmits: that's the 5 orders that can be used for a fatality
 tomatoes: and in any order
 MSmits: well surface should be first shouldnt it?
 MSmits: if you're using it?
 Illedan: Might not :think
 Illedan: :thinking:
 Illedan: But most likely
 wlesavo: but you need to decide if you using it or not
 MSmits: yes, so 2 combinations
 MSmits: just a factor of 2 is not so bad
 chucknorris: hm didn't think of that. I let my eval to decide that :p
 tobk: for regular turns, I have fixed order surface?, move, torpedo?, mine?, trigger?, silence?; for "kill-shots" I do surface (if health permits), move (charge torpedo or silence), silence?, torpedo
 MSmits: hmm but isnt it sometimes better to silence, then move?
 MSmits: to reach a certain spot
 MSmits: since silence is a straight line
 MSmits: also you might need to trigger, then move, then torpedo, or trigger last to get out of the way of the blast
 tobk: yes, you can reach some spaces you could not reach otherwise. also I'm not considering mines in that step yet, have to see how to integrate them in the reasoning
 MSmits: i suppose you can code the blast separately and then pick the best position in the tree to use it
 MSmits: this is pretty complicated =/
 chucknorris: If you surface after a long silence you can save space. or if you move to other sector you can reduce the information given to the enemy by your sector id
 MSmits: chucknorris true, but we're just talking about fatality check
 chucknorris: umm okay
 tobk: at the moment I check whether the "damage potenttial" (estimated damage a torpedo does when fired to one spot) is &gt;= the opp health, then find a spot where to move to make that shot
 MSmits: actually, for fatality, you should probably just always surface
 MSmits: unless you're at 1 hp
 tobk: adding mines to that equation wil be a bit tricky, but I still have a weekend to go&#160;:-)
 MSmits: tobk yeah, i thought about doing torpedos that way, makes sense
 chucknorris: I don't have a separate fatality bot, I have a "combat" bot, which gives big reward for winning :p
 tobk: yeah, but you might also have to get so close to opp so you have to take damage yourself
 tobk: e.g. if you and opp are in the same space and you can't silence
 Illedan: I have a big spagetti mess for instakill :D
 MSmits: yes, thats what worries me Illedan :P
 Illedan: Working on some combat stuff for the last 2 weeks, but motivation and energy :P 
 wlesavo: i was wondering if there is better way to do it but yeah, also big plate of spagetti 
 MSmits: good to know
 MSmits: there for sure is a way to reduce the spaghetti as much as possible. Always surfacing is one of those things
 MSmits: (except when it kills you)
 MSmits: but still a lot of spaghetti
 Febrin: And what do you think about sonar?While doing fatality consider a situation when using sonar gives us 100% estimation about the enemy position.Also apart from the fatality sometimes it might quite reduce the number of enemy positions
 MSmits: yes, but you cant immediately get sonar information, so you need to wait another turn
 MSmits: but sure, in general it might help
 tomatoes: i only start fatality checks if 100% known position
 chucknorris: and you shouldn't surface if you are at 2 hp and the only way to kill the enemy is to damage yourself to MSmits
 MSmits: that's not actually necessary though
 MSmits: true chucknorris, i just thought of that earlier
 MSmits: lag
 MSmits: so still more spaghetti&#160;:)
 MSmits: but tomatoes, you could for example have on one end of the map a mine where he could be, and near you is also a spot where he could be. Then you can trigger the mine and torpedo the other spot and get fatality
 Febrin: Thats another interesting case
 tomatoes: didn't add mines to fatality yet :sweat_smile:
 Febrin: Now I am also trying to avoid spaghetti fatality. I consider brute force through (?) Let say we have 5 moves. So 5! * 2^5 = 3840. Move can give you 4 new positions, silence 16, so 3840 * 16 * 4 = 2.5 * 10^5, in practice it should be less
 Febrin:  If you fix some sequence of moves for eg. torpedo always after move it's even less
 tomatoes: why 3840? only 4 moves
 MSmits: silence has 13 combinations 
 MSmits: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1
 MSmits: move has 3 at most
 Febrin: Oh right you cant go back, I did a big upperbound
 MSmits: also, first move, or first silence
 Febrin: yup
 MSmits:  so 3 * 13 * 2 = 702
 MSmits: err
 MSmits: 78
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: so 78 possible spots you can end up in
 Febrin: Thats a little
 MSmits: actually less
 MSmits: because if you stay in place, the order of silence doesnt matter
 Febrin: I regret my choice of Python instead of cpp but it might be doable
 tomatoes: and a +8 torpedos if health=1
 MSmits: why + 8?
 tomatoes: around
 MSmits: arent there way more than 8 spots you can shoot at?
 tomatoes: around target
 MSmits: that assumes you know it's position
 MSmits: it might be 4 places it can be at
 MSmits: clustered
 MSmits: sill can hit them all with one torpedo
 tomatoes: can hit myself
 MSmits: that too
 MSmits: it's good style to do as much damage as possible to yourself, as long as you win&#160;:)
 MSmits: just explode a mine on yourself for giggles, even if it doesnt damage the opponent
 Beerus: does anyone know if silver boss tracker is perfect?
 MSmits: hard to say what is perfect
 MSmits: there are some tiny improvements you can make that are almost certainly not worth it
 Beerus: does it store every trajectory after silence?
 MSmits: no idea, I'm guessing it might
 MSmits: it's pretty essential
 Beerus: i store everything and i get more points than him
 MSmits: it's not the only thing that maters
 MSmits: matters
 wlesavo: it sometimes timeouts, so probably it does, i know gold one does not store it for a fact :slight_smile:
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: why is gold one so good then?
 Beerus: missing a point can be fatal though
 tomatoes: cheats
 wlesavo: most of other basic features and mineavoidance
 MSmits: no selftracking either I guess then?
 wlesavo: i consider self tracking as a basic feature
 MSmits: but if you dont track all silence paths, how can you properly self track?
 Famout: I just make the path then follow it myself, and silience at good points along it.
 wlesavo: i mean i still track it, just keep only common parts of a paths that come to the same point
 MSmits: ahh well thats still perfect tracking, only with pruning when necessary
 MSmits: thats the way to do it
 Illedan: I can crash myself by using too much silence for my own tracking :D
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I used your silence spam bot to get my pruning working Illedan
 MSmits: like 2 weeks ago that was
 wlesavo: i crushed some top bots by spaming mines lol
 wlesavo: ii mean crashed
 wlesavo: damn those words
 Illedan: Legend is full spamfest :D
 AntiSquid: 322245 possible mine positions counted from all paths, ya no wonder i time out&#160;:/
 wlesavo: lol
 MSmits: mmh are those positions from where mines could have been laid, or positions where mines could be&#160;?
 AntiSquid: everything
 MSmits: it's pretty important not to track positions where mines could be, as separate states
 MSmits: that will explode your state space
 wlesavo: 3 orders larger then the whole ocean
 MSmits: instead track places from which mines were laid
 MSmits: reduces branching by a factor of 4
 AntiSquid: the silences are enough 
 MSmits: they are bad yeah
 wlesavo: ocean of silence
 AntiSquid: wait i only track where mines could be placed
 wlesavo: the submarines of mines and silence
 AntiSquid: but some replays are full of silences and mines so ...
 MSmits: from or to AntiSquid?
 MSmits: placed from, or placed to
 AntiSquid: i don't get your question
 MSmits: the sub is on a position
 MSmits: it can place on 4 locations
 MSmits: do you record the 4, or the 1
 AntiSquid: ya i use the sub position
 MSmits: ah ok, thats best imho
 MSmits: my 20 depth beamsearch mine avoidance has turned my bot into a color filler
 MSmits: it looks like a tron bot :P

 Illedan: I have a depth of 4 :P
 MSmits: well it only considers moves, so it doesnt have much branching
 Illedan: Yeah, mine is only moving too

 Swagboy: CSB pod trying to reach the checkpoint
 MSmits: someone teach that dog -3vel
 NormantasStankevicius: does silence dashing more than 1 help in siilver?
 karliso: MSmits Do you think your both will remain at number 1 as other players keep submitting?
 MSmits: good question
 MSmits: it's very strong as player 1, but it may be weaker than yours as player 2
 MSmits: after all, you have the opening book for player 2
 MSmits: I dont have it at all
 MSmits: only for player 1\
 MSmits: my bot beats re curse without any book
 MSmits: but against yours it does not, only 45% combined winrate as p1 + p2
 MSmits: but thats without *any* book, so it's not fair, because you have one
 karliso: I had some ideas about uttt that I wanted to try, you gave me a reason to try them out.
 MSmits: good, try them, but be careful about getting too deterministic as player 2. It was real easy to make your current version lose 100% as p2
 karliso: Yes, I saw games.
 AntiSquid: are you playing ocean of code karliso?
 karliso: No
 Illedan: MSmits, saying I can download 1 replay vs karli and get 100% win as p2? :D
 Illedan: *p1
 MSmits: not exactly, he has some variation. Maybe 10-20 different plays
 MSmits: also, there comes a point where my bot can take the win without needing any further book
 MSmits: if your bot is not good enough, it wont know how to proceed from there
 MSmits: my book ends somewhere between 20-30 
 MSmits: ply i mean
 MSmits: the game goes to 40-60 plies
 MSmits: but the advantage is great enough at ply 30 or so
 MSmits: the same is true for re curse and miarem btw Illedan
 MSmits: so if you have a good book, you can copy my bot vs them
 MSmits: good bot I mean
 MSmits: good bot, copy book :P
 AntiSquid: to risk or not to risk submit?
 kovi: im not too happy seeing that submit of 2 days ago is better than the latest
 pb4: kovi&#160;: same here... except that is was 6 days old
 kovi: maybe i should trie that as well. 6 days ago i had good winrate vs. you
 kovi: actally the problem was jolindien all along
 pb4: MSmits&#160;: does your beam search guarantee that you don't have only one starting move at the beginning&#160;?
 pb4: jolindien is solid
 MSmits: not sure what you mean pb4
 MSmits: do you mean does it take into account floodfill?
 MSmits: I have a floodfill score and a damage probability score
 MSmits: and it minimizes that over depth x 
 MSmits: and maximizes floodfill obv
 MSmits: if you mean, does it give a score for movement flexibility to react to opponent, then no
 MSmits: I can see the value in not being forced down a narrow corridor
 RavenKZP: oh come on... Silver Boss shoot himself and make my bot timeout XD
 MSmits: haha, you assume an opponent will never shoot himself?
 MSmits: dangerous&#160;:)
 RavenKZP: well ye but actualy no
 RavenKZP: i've go this one... commented, because of it wasnt working perfectly
 RavenKZP: and until now it was good :P
 pb4: MSmit&#160;: beam search keeps only a limited number of possibilties
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but at this depth, there is very little pruning
 pb4: if all those possibilities start with the same move, it doesn't matter how deep your search goes
 MSmits: very true pb4
 MSmits: oh I see what you mean now
 pb4: My question basically is&#160;: do you have a way to maintain "first move diversity" or do you measure at which depth there's no diversity left&#160;?
 MSmits: you mean while filtering, keep some states for each starting move
 pb4: Yes
 pb4: See for example kimiyuki's Hypersonic code
 MSmits: I would bother with that if it was pruning a lot, but it's not really
 pb4: I think he has a way to do this
 MSmits: yeah, I have a HS bot too, but it handles things differently
 MSmits: it has a multi-positional movementstate
 MSmits: so the player is at multiple first moves at once
 MSmits: let's not get into that though :P
 MSmits: my HS bot is a big mess I never want to touch again
 MSmits: 2.2k lines i think
 NormantasStankevicius: bro
 NormantasStankevicius: My code is almost 1k lines
 pb4: bro
 NormantasStankevicius: and I am pretty much idk what to do besides making a simulation at this point
 pb4: my code doesn't compile in time anymore -_-
 MSmits: my ooc code is 1800 and still lacking a lot
 MSmits: trying to work in a fatality function
 MSmits: it's not easy&#160;:(
 NormantasStankevicius: I would be extremely happy if I leave silver by the end of this competition
 wlesavo: i had to rewrite it, that was a pain
 MSmits: why rewrite?
 MSmits: I would be extremely happy if i make legend, but I doubt it
 wlesavo: first version didnt have mines, and was used only when i exactly know the possition of an opponent, i think it was the last improovement to gold boss, after that i broked some tuning and in that crippled condition its doomed to guard the gates of legend :slight_smile:
 MSmits: my nemesis then
 MSmits: I wonder if the fatality function is enough to get me from rank 20-30 to beating gold boss 
 MSmits: but I doubt it
 wlesavo: with an ok mine avoidance and some luck i guess it could be enough
 MSmits: hmm, we'll see
 MSmits: today and tomorrow is basically the time i have. I think sunday I will be doing social distanced DnD
 MSmits: wonder what that'll be like
 Astrobytes: Remote-link DnD?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Should be a laugh!
 tomatoes: fatality pushed me from 50-70 to top10
 MSmits: I think maybe I'll roll a bit more critical hits than I usually so :grin:
 Astrobytes: lol
 MichaelPu: MSmith, I don't have a fatality function, and got past the boss
 NormantasStankevicius: Hmmm HMmm Fetality&#160;:&gt;
 MSmits: MichaelPu any tips you want to share?
 MichaelPu: don't let anyone use fatality on you&#160;:)
 MSmits: great advice :P
 MSmits: do you mean you have an anti-fatality check as well?
 MSmits: to make sure the opponent can't fatality you the next turn?
 AntiSquid: fecality?
 MSmits: :poop:
 MichaelPu: no, just trying to do well trough the whole game, and not just the last move
 MSmits: ah ok
 NormantasStankevicius: By fatality, you mean check if you can kill the enemy before he kills, eg. person has 2hp and you know his position so you silence dash to him and kill&#160;?
 MSmits: just any way to kill him on your turn
 MSmits: there's lots of possible ways to dit
 MSmits: do it
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, but I go silence spam
 NormantasStankevicius: so it's torpedoes I guess
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: silence spam is of limited use
 MSmits: doesn't work beyond a certain poit
 MichaelPu: this situation just gets more rare in top gold and legend
 AntiSquid: +1 promotion
 MichaelPu: when you know the opp position 100%
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, I will need to track my postion aswell, and do it
 MichaelPu: when they are on low health
 NormantasStankevicius: but what is a good indicator when to silence?
 MSmits: no idea, i do it when i have it ready :P
 NormantasStankevicius: But let me guess
 NormantasStankevicius: You prioritize torpedoes &gt; mines &gt; silence?
 NormantasStankevicius: and you try to fill the map?
 MSmits: thats about it, i also try to avoid mines
 NormantasStankevicius: Okay, I'll need mines
 RoboStac: if you self track what the opponent knows you can use that to choose good silences (add lots of options / silence when the opponent has a good idea where you are)
 NormantasStankevicius: and if I have no point of placing a mine (aka there is one in range, I'll just silence spam)
 GHV: Please share ur suggestions about my contribution...
 GHV: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4975741069fa865858680fb1061312a51bdb">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4975741069fa865858680fb1061312a51bdb</a>
 NormantasStankevicius: RoboStac yeah, but what am I curious how to predict, cause to me, it's likje couple hundred lines of codes to predict the enemy how to outrun
 NormantasStankevicius: would become,  what are some good things to do when I know the enemy position?
 MSmits: if you have mines, blow them up, if you are near, shoot torpedo, if you know where they are, you also know where they put the mines and you can avoid them
 ZarthaxX: getting that legend MSmits?
 MSmits: dont know ZarthaxX, it's up in the air 
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: let's see how sonar works instead of silence
 MSmits: I figured that since my silence sucks, i might as well use sonar
 wlesavo: MSmits i basically feed my output command to the same tracker with different flag
 MSmits: yeah, that's smart coding. Not sure if I can do that with my current code. It's pretty complicated
 AntiSquid: oh come on&#160;:/
 MSmits: what is it squiddy?
 AntiSquid: my bot isn't strong enough
 MSmits: not yet
 AntiSquid: and i am tired of this game
 MSmits: I have faith in you squiddy
 MSmits: me too 
 AntiSquid: from day 1, but still tired of it nonetheless
 MSmits: I liked it when i was coding tracking and such
 AntiSquid: it's not even strong enough to stabilize high and get pushed&#160;:/
 blasterpoard: I just found a very interesting piece of data about mines that deserves a post mortem on its own xD suddelny a lot of things make sense
 MSmits: I'm glad someone can draw life lessons from this game :P
 eulerscheZahl: are you out of the contest, MSmits?
 MSmits: no, i want to code a fatality function, maybe some self tracking to more smartly use silence and then tweak a bit with ability use and such
 MSmits: there's still some room for improvement thats not *too* annoying to code. 
 blasterpoard: MSmits it's just that a thing I didn't think was important turned out to be the main reason my bot could ever reach top10
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: do write it up later, you always make these claims that make us curious and then dont explain them during contests :P  it's mean!
 blasterpoard: and I thought that changing this number the other way would improve the bot
 muy31: GH
 AntiSquid: about tracking or placement?
 muy31: GHV isnt t too eay?
 muy31: I like it though GHV
 AntiSquid: wish top 20 would play nice and just timeout
 eulerscheZahl: as #21 i agree
 AntiSquid: i meant gold 
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 NormantasStankevicius: AntiSquid I feel the same, but in silver&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: what does your bot have so far NormantasStankevicius&#160;?
 AntiSquid: maybe there's a quick improvement you could do
 NormantasStankevicius: Silence detection (with a glitch), Silence spam, quite a bit of detecting, and torpedo fire
 NormantasStankevicius: right now, making mines
 NormantasStankevicius: prioriotazing mines &gt; silence spam*
 NormantasStankevicius: Next I'll go Silence up to enemy and finish
 AntiSquid: and you silence right away? maybe that's something to tweak
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, I am thinking of improving how I silence
 AntiSquid: i know exactly what i need to do for a guaranteed improvement
 NormantasStankevicius: and move away from enemy if he is not in range and torpedo cooldown &gt; 0, dash away if he in range and torpedo cooldown &gt; 0; shoot and dash away if he is in range, if he is out of range and cooldown = 0, check if I can dash up to him and fire
 NormantasStankevicius: else, just spam
 idkhow2codee: also check if there are islands on the path
 idkhow2codee: aren't*
 NormantasStankevicius: well yeah
 NormantasStankevicius: right now I have a quick check
 NormantasStankevicius: for all locations I can dash to
 NormantasStankevicius: but for safety
 NormantasStankevicius: I just SILENCE 0
 NormantasStankevicius: until I implement it and turn it on
 idkhow2codee: I do silence 0 cuz im lazy :p
 NormantasStankevicius: I also have a DistanceFill(Floodfill, but to see if my torpedoes can get to it and similar stuff)
 NormantasStankevicius: right now I'll do mines
 NormantasStankevicius: try to deploy as many mines as I can, then silence spam
 idkhow2codee: do you use any path finding algorithm?
 NormantasStankevicius: Floodfill
 idkhow2codee: oh k
 NormantasStankevicius: I have a bit of a randomization kinda
 NormantasStankevicius: tries to move in circle
 NormantasStankevicius: but if it touches the wall
 Nerchio: GOGOGOGO
 NormantasStankevicius: starts to move in semicircles
 Nerchio: LEGEND IS SO CLOSE
 Nerchio: COME ON
 NormantasStankevicius: GO GO GO!
 idkhow2codee: gl
 Nerchio: LET"S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 eulerscheZahl: your capslock seems stuck
 Nerchio: IT IS
 Nerchio: 10 SECONDS
 Nerchio: TO LEGEND
 NormantasStankevicius: He is captivated
 NormantasStankevicius: he has been trying legend for days
 AntiSquid: Nerchio the guy below you is pushing boss back up it seems :p
 NormantasStankevicius: perhaps months or years
 Nerchio: yesssssss
 Nerchio: legend
 Nerchio: welcome
 NormantasStankevicius: Nice
 NormantasStankevicius:&#160;!
 Swagboy: Wp nerchio!
 AntiSquid: :o
 Nerchio: such a good submit
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 Nerchio: i destroyed the boss
 darkhorse64: Nerchio: I can understand how you feel
 AntiSquid: great
 eulerscheZahl: i still saw you 0.04 below the boss :P
 gaha: was it the same code or you're modyfing something
 idkhow2codee: GZ
 Nerchio: hmm i was working on something else and did 10 submits today ending in top5 usually
 AntiSquid: sash too&#160;?
 Nerchio: just needed some luck xD
 AntiSquid: ya luck is most important
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid getting lonely&#160;:(
 tobk: still the same bot as yesterday Nerchio?
 AntiSquid: wdym euler? 
 tobk: congrats, that was hair's breadth
 eulerscheZahl: other active chat users going to legend, leaving you behind
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: ya
 eulerscheZahl: even zeno turned against you
 wlesavo: Nerchio grac
 AntiSquid: better legend 
 Uljahn: some are in silver though :relieved:
 Nerchio: i fixed some stuff
 Nerchio: small stuff
 Nerchio: to be more consistent yesterday
 Nerchio: but most was the same
 Nerchio: for a good entrance into the league 2-0 vs eulerscheZahl 
 Illedan: AntiSquid<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgflip.com/i/3x128v">https://imgflip.com/i/3x128v</a>
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: beat all pokemans
 cegprakash: Do I need enemy prediction in wood1 of OOC?
 Nerchio: no
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have prediction in legend
 cegprakash: it' s not worth it? :O
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 cegprakash: that was the next thing I thought of adding
 NormantasStankevicius: by prediction, you mean
 Nerchio: maybe he means enemy tracking
 NormantasStankevicius: guessing where enemy is?
 eulerscheZahl: i have tracking of previous turns to estimate the location
 cegprakash: yes
 eulerscheZahl: but no prediction of future actions
 NormantasStankevicius: It's very worth it
 eulerscheZahl: tracking is a must-have
 NormantasStankevicius: basically you won't get out of silver if you do not counter silence
 cegprakash: yeah that's what I mean eulerscheZahl use the history to eliminate non possible positions
 NormantasStankevicius: and out of bronze without basic tracking
 cegprakash: I currently throw bomb at last known enemy grid
 cegprakash: and it's performing worser than randomly throwing bombs
 eulerscheZahl: are you playing codejam this year cegprakash?
 cegprakash: 1A disqualified yes
 cegprakash: when is 1B
 eulerscheZahl: sunday
 eulerscheZahl: during the night in your timezone
 eulerscheZahl: which is why i skipped 1A
 cegprakash: night is good time for me
 cegprakash: I am a night coder
 NormantasStankevicius: &gt;.&gt; can relate
 wlesavo: nice blasterpoard, i guess your mine thingy worked
 cegprakash: why is Silence called a silence I don't understand
 cegprakash: it's just jumping 
 Swagboy: Silence move
 eulerscheZahl: because the opponent doesn't know in which direction you move
 cegprakash: direction is known
 wlesavo: no
 eulerscheZahl: not for silence
 cegprakash: oh
 blasterpoard: wlesavo it could still be just a lucky submit
 cegprakash: okay so that multiplies possibilities by 4
 wlesavo: sure, but still
 cegprakash: that s***s with each silence used
 blasterpoard: it looks like I found a magic number though
 idkhow2codee: it multiplies possibilities * 17 I guess
 eulerscheZahl: Nerchio at 15 already :o
 idkhow2codee: but still if they don't intersect
 NormantasStankevicius: silence basically is 13* (except when we get surface, that becomes 17 places he can be after that)
 tobk: Next time I write a bot that just moves randomly, then submit a bazillion times until I go to Legend&#160;:-P
 NormantasStankevicius: ^
 NormantasStankevicius: My bot fluctuates between silver 140 and 20
 wlesavo: blasterpoard looking forward for your pm  :slight_smile:
 idkhow2codee: well it is 4 directions * 4 possible new positions thats 16
 eulerscheZahl: you can also wait at the current cell
 NormantasStankevicius: + 0 idkhow2codee
 eulerscheZahl: wait in 4 directions :D
 NormantasStankevicius: you can just not move
 blasterpoard: wlesavo the funny thing is that there's still a couple of things I need to implement, and they are quite important
 MSmits: idkhow2codee it's 3 directions * 4 + 1 for stationary
 MSmits: you can't silence in the direction you came from
 cegprakash: when  u use sonar for 4 steps will all the cells between the current position and the new position will be marked visited?
 idkhow2codee: oh k I didnt know
 cegprakash: sorry silence
 Swagboy: Yes
 cegprakash: when  u use silence for 4 steps will all the cells between the current position and the new position will be marked visited?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: yes cegprakash its in the statement
 Scarfield: that is an argument that wont work xD
 eulerscheZahl: reading the statement is so overratedwatch some replays and then make wild guesses
 idkhow2codee: "(not visiting already visited cells or islands)" right
 MSmits: right
 Nerchio: btw what is default ai in legend
 Nerchio: not worth playing against?
 MSmits: also, surface doesn't teleport you to a different cell, just letting you know
 eulerscheZahl: defaultAI = the default from the beginning of the contest
 wlesavo: blasterpoard i have nothing on my mind, maybe after the contest i will stole a thing or two from pms
 blasterpoard: wlesavo I mostly use the speed of C++ to do a lot of time-consuming things... not that interesting
 wlesavo: oh well, still interesting to read
 kovi: it is so hard to tell what is important and what is not
 wlesavo: luck is very important
 blasterpoard: it's important to have a good winrate vs kovi
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 duckquackduck: wish there was a better way to debug rather than printing to console. Even that is limited since you can only print so much data.  :( Very hard to determine if tracking opponent pathing is accurate. I am losing my opponent at some point, no idea where
 wlesavo: blasterpoard that was my tactic since silver
 kovi: i definitely do better if i dont submit spam. just let other submit (except joli)
 eulerscheZahl: offline debugging is the way to go duckquackduck
 duckquackduck: is there any guide with tips on how to set it up? 
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: write all you input directly to stderr so it appears under the viewer
 eulerscheZahl: step2 (the hardest one): write something to download the json data for a given replay id
 eulerscheZahl: and extract the error stream (you need user authentication to get your stderr)
 eulerscheZahl: step 3: write all the error stream into a file on your local disk
 rwilson:&#160;;) or go nuts and build your own visualization plugin&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: step 4: configure your IDE to read the file as input
 eulerscheZahl: step 5: breakpoint for your given turn you want to debug
 eulerscheZahl: i might write something about it instead of a post mortem. my bot really sucks, not worth writing about it
 duckquackduck: oh&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: it takes some time to set it up. especially if you have no experience with web requests
 duckquackduck: maybe something to try after this contest&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: this contest was quite long, so i invested some time in tool setup at first
 duckquackduck: :thumbsup: yes, I have spend far too long trying to debug by printing stuff to console. wastes too much time
 Scarfield: 34 submitting&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: but only 4 at csb
 Scarfield: i will make an alt, prepare a bot designed to win against the wood boss in CSB, but not rank up. Submit some times and lower the boss score, like an hour before this contest ends :p
 idkhow2codee: That's a shame that I have just started participating. only 2 days left&#160;:(
 idkhow2codee: but there will be next contest in may right?
 eulerscheZahl: may 7th - 17th
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>even with a video
 Swagboy: duckquackduck You can also manage to do this with simple copy pastes, a bit longer but easier to begin with
 eulerscheZahl: annoying if you want to debug turn 100
 eulerscheZahl: you need all the history for your tracker
 Swagboy: I'm just printing the cin as cerr and use them to emulate the game in local
 Swagboy: Maybe different from what you're doing
 Swagboy: Because once you have the cin in local, it's easy debugging any turn
 eulerscheZahl: no, i do the same. just the way how i extract the cerr to use it locally is different i guess
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's ./cg_replay_download &lt;replay_id&gt; and i have it in a local textfile
 Swagboy: And then you plug your bot on this textfile and launch it, isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Swagboy: Ok ok same indeed
 eulerscheZahl: but i said that above :Pconfigured my IDE to use the textfile instead of stdin
 Swagboy: Aha yes yes, went quickly over those explanation, bit tired hehe
 Swagboy: And the tricky thing for me is that I need to set up a iteration count instead of a timer, otherwise it doesn't act the same local
 eulerscheZahl: no problemi'll go outside now. working from home causes some lack of physical movement for me
 ZarthaxX: i need some of that
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Swagboy: Are you in germany eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't even allowed to go outside alone?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, germany
 ZarthaxX: just for buying foo
 ZarthaxX: food
 ZarthaxX: well and ppl take out the dog
 ZarthaxX: thats it
 eulerscheZahl: a biking trip alone or with those living in your house is perfectly fine here. and taking out your dog :D
 Swagboy: I'm there too and I'm glad that the ausgangssperre  is way nicer than in France
 ZarthaxX: here you are not allowed to go outside with someone to buy food
 ZarthaxX: sooo :P
 ZarthaxX: it hasbeen like 26 days like this
 Nerchio: in Poland you can't go outside anymore if you don't wear a mask
 Swagboy: Wow crazy, what if you don't have one?
 Nerchio: idk
 eulerscheZahl: get creative in making one
 Nerchio: well they say anything can be used as a mask even like a scarf ;D
 ZarthaxX: ah well here is the same
 eulerscheZahl: might come here too, at least for public transportation
 Swagboy: Where are you from ZarthaxX?
 eulerscheZahl: and shopping maybe
 ZarthaxX: argentina
 ZarthaxX: is germany stopping the virus already&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even follow these statswe had really high numbers compared to other countries. but that might be because of higher testing capabilities
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</a>
 reCurse: The most tested country in europe yeah
 ZarthaxX: i see
 eulerscheZahl: so it makes no sense to just talk about confirmed cases
 eulerscheZahl: but now i go for real. want to be back before it's getting dark outside
 ZarthaxX: cya sharktoad
 AntiSquid: is US gonna nuke china after this is over?
 AntiSquid: they love their bombs
 ZarthaxX: thought kind of the same lol
 reCurse: Fox news is this way -&gt; :door:
 AntiSquid: i don't watch any news
 Zenoscave: thank you reCurse

 cegprakash: hey anid finally I found u
 cegprakash: when did you overtake me in India rankings
 cegprakash: how did u beat me so quick out off nowhere
 anid: Some time back, Im not exactly 1 guy
 anid: a few people use this acc
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: that relieves me a bit
 cegprakash: the best in India still
 anid: we each do 1-2 multiplayers
 anid: so not really best in India
 anid: I only do C4L
 cegprakash: I mean I am still
 anid: Oh xD that for sure
 cegprakash: but I'm always up for a challenge from next gen coders
 cegprakash: that's why I keep in touch
 anid: Not really a challenge, one guy in our group is pretty good but rest of us are just learning from magus`s document
 Beerus: why i am getting timeout when i shouldnt
 RavenKZP: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 darkhorse64: cegprakash: the answer is quite simple. Copy/paste bots
 Uljahn: is anid == anirudhp?
 Zenoscave: probably
 darkhorse64: Guys, look at his profile. Guru in one month&#160;! 
 Zenoscave: definitely then
 Astrobytes: anirudhp was the cheater guy that euler talks about?
 Zenoscave: yes
 Zenoscave: Anid we know who you are
 ZarthaxX: anid anirudhp, almost same
 ZarthaxX: :P

 Astrobytes: lol, that last one
 cegprakash: it's okay to use multis or share accounts but not at the cost of abusing the top 1% leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: and he managed to beat me in CGFunge Prime :cry:and i think that's a legit score, noone else has that amount of points
 eulerscheZahl: the tagline :rofl:m=m0/?(1-c2/v2) ==&gt; Running makes you fatter
 eulerscheZahl: it's funny because it's v^2/c^2 and not c^2/v^2
 cegprakash: what is that formula
 eulerscheZahl: the&#160;? is a sqrt
 eulerscheZahl: that's how the mass changes with increasing speed

 NormantasStankevicius: better to read this then panic while watching matches
 eulerscheZahl: he wrote "then", not "than" :P
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, I am sweating while watching my bot being murdured&#160;:&lt;
 AntiSquid: 7k registered, imagine the leaderboard if all participated
 NormantasStankevicius: also panicking and seeing more colours than I should
 eulerscheZahl: i know that feeling. i even know how to play better as a human in some cases. but no idea how to express it in code yet
 AntiSquid: CG would need to hire a lumberjack
 eulerscheZahl: the last contest with more players was mean maxbut to be fair, it's by far the longest contest except for locam
 eulerscheZahl: longer duration = more players joining
 WINWINWIN: But most of the new players are at the bottom like me&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the most important thing is that you have fun
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe learn a new thing or two
 idkhow2codee: ultimately bot is still better than human(at least bots above wood) though
 WINWINWIN: Yes, ty eaulerscheZahl for the awesome contest
 eulerscheZahl: my part was the smallest of the 3 creators mentioned
 WINWINWIN: K then ty G-Rom and illedan xD
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I call all the bots below silver as bots
 cegprakash: not humans
 WINWINWIN: why?
 cegprakash: humans think better
 cegprakash: like an AI
 cegprakash: than a stupid robot
 WINWINWIN: I am a stupid robot!&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I'm too in OOC
 cegprakash: still in wood2
 tobk: I don't get it. in the second replay he somehow mirrors the opponent in the very same move, while streaming excerpts from H2G2. But what's with the first replay?
 cegprakash: sorry wood1
 eulerscheZahl: a German politician called all those bots who used their gmail address to write complains about his internet politics
 idkhow2codee: robots are better because of predictions and no possibility to blunder
 eulerscheZahl: tobk what are you talking about?
 WINWINWIN: Cegprakash, if you got to W1, can you tell me how to improve?
 eulerscheZahl: chess?
 tobk: the replays you shared half an hour ago
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 struct: its copy pasted bots
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN just move and shoot randomly 
 eulerscheZahl: it's a beam search with variable depth
 tobk: ah, that explains the mirroring
 eulerscheZahl: so when time close to 100ms, end search
 WINWINWIN: shoot randomly is enough?
 cegprakash: yes
 eulerscheZahl: for wood it is
 WINWINWIN: thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: don't shoot yourself
 cegprakash: actually I got to wood2 without shooting
 cegprakash: I was definitely #6 without shooting
 eulerscheZahl: as everyone starts in wood2
 eulerscheZahl: congrats ceg
 WINWINWIN: xD
 cegprakash: sorry wood1*
 idkhow2codee: I got wood with pacifist bot
 idkhow2codee: wood1*
 cegprakash: pacifist?
 idkhow2codee: yes just don't attack
 cegprakash: like mother therasa?
 WINWINWIN: Just noticed ur 1st EulerscheZahl awesome!!!
 idkhow2codee: yes exactly
 idkhow2codee: but there is no way to get out of the w without predictions and attacking
 cegprakash: acctually I think there is
 cegprakash: I am going to add safer turns to my bot
 idkhow2codee: well but that's just luck then
 cegprakash: when I haave multiple directions to turn, turn in a direction with more space
 cegprakash: so that we don't suffocate in choke points
 cegprakash: this will avoid SURFACE completely
 cegprakash: so we remain full health
 cegprakash: it's same as Tron 
 idkhow2codee: u can always get stuck somewhere though
 cegprakash: very rare 
 cegprakash: if u add this
 cegprakash: just random shoot + this can take to bronze I'm sure
 cegprakash: but I'm cleaning some mess up
 cegprakash: so I can reach higher leagues
 idkhow2codee: currently im w1 too and I'm trycking to implement predictions 
 cegprakash: yeah just ignore enemy's silence commands
 cegprakash: just track enemy movements and that's a very good way to start
 cegprakash: I also noticed wood1 boss always uses SURFACE command on 2nd turn just so he is beatable
 idkhow2codee: how I move: well I just move with priority N E S W
 WINWINWIN: Cegprakash, how will u use that, u have to beat all of the other bots in the league as well?
 idkhow2codee: but sometimes got stuck forever so added to avoid positions where surfaced
 cegprakash: that's good idkhow2codee but before doing NESW give priority to the directions with more space
 cegprakash: that's what I'm going to add
 idkhow2codee: yes that might work
 idkhow2codee: god our bots are so pathetic xd
 idkhow2codee: where did u started me 2 days ago
 cegprakash: started yesterday night
 cegprakash: like 3 hours of work so far
 WINWINWIN: Wow!
 idkhow2codee: nc
 cegprakash: my random shooting bot was #64 in wood1
 cegprakash: but I added enemy grid tracking
 cegprakash: used a lot of Radars
 cegprakash: sorry sonars
 cegprakash: which is pretty useless..
 idkhow2codee: so u just shoot somewhere inside that region?
 cegprakash: yes even if he moves away from that grid
 cegprakash: I keep shooting there
 idkhow2codee: xd
 cegprakash: until my sonar tracks him again
 idkhow2codee: well that's weird
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: that's why my rank got low
 idkhow2codee: u can see when he got hit though
 cegprakash: I didn't add enemy life tracking.. I tracked my life tracking though
 idkhow2codee: why
 cegprakash: if he hits me I assume he is in my grid and keep shooting my grid
 cegprakash: which is pretty bad if he keeps shooting from neighboring grid
 idkhow2codee: well that's not bad
 cegprakash: :D
 idkhow2codee: yes but still
 cegprakash: yeah he'll be scared to come into my grid
 cegprakash: this grid is mine
 cegprakash: until I choke myself
 WINWINWIN: after the contest, is there any place to study this multi?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: forum
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum">https://www.codingame.com/forum</a>
 WINWINWIN: do the top players still write post mortems?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: my wood1 post mortem is funny
 cegprakash: isn't it
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 lxnn: I'm a bit late to the game. Question: if you move and surface in the same turn, do you move and then surface or surface and then move?
 blasterpoard: lxnn depends on which you write first
 lxnn: Ah
 cegprakash: if u move why do u want to surface?
 cegprakash: don't surface and lose ur life
 idkhow2codee: orders works consecutively
 idkhow2codee: they activate after each other
 idkhow2codee: work*
 cegprakash: it makes sense in the case of SURFACE followed by a MOVE.
 cegprakash: but MOVE followed by a SURFACE is never good
 idkhow2codee: yes
 lxnn: Right, thanks for that
 anid: But if you inevitably have to surface?
 lxnn: why I ask is that it makes a difference to tracking the opponent which comes first, I think
 cegprakash: u have no other option in that case anid 
 cegprakash: just make sure u don't get into that situation 
 cegprakash: at least after reaching wood1
 cegprakash: yes ofc lxnn
 idkhow2codee: so it would be wise to keep dir of enemy in case enemy used surface
 idkhow2codee: silence*
 idkhow2codee: Do u guys write code that would be considered clean?
 Swagboy: Rather, for a month of contest, you need clean code
 Nerchio: i started less than 10 days ago
 Nerchio: not a real programmer
 Nerchio: i started messy i continued messy and i ended in a mess
 idkhow2codee: :joy:
 idkhow2codee: bot logic is hard to maintain
 duckquackduck: You can only place a mine or move, right? Can't do both?
 idkhow2codee: in fact I write such bot for the first time and everything from scratch
 idkhow2codee: @Nerchio what do you mean by not real programmer?
 Nerchio: it means this is the first app i wrote that is longer than idk 50 lines 
 Nerchio: that might be why my bot is 2600 lines of if statements
 idkhow2codee: :joy:
 idkhow2codee: is there a limit?
 idkhow2codee: to size
 Astrobytes: 100k chars iirc
 Nerchio: i have 87k
 idkhow2codee: but if you use setup properly external editor then you can include other files so does it count?
 Nerchio: idk can you?
 Nerchio: i have everything in 1 file
 idkhow2codee: me2 :p
 idkhow2codee: yes it is I saw guy doing it on stream
 Astrobytes: If you have a script to combine all source files then that's cool, but the single file you submit on CG cannot exceed that limit
 idkhow2codee: hmm so he combined them using script
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's one or two python scripts out there for C++ (or write your own), some for Java, C#
 idkhow2codee: one more question: Who handles execution of code? and what's the maximum usage of ram?
 idkhow2codee: just curious
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Astrobytes: And some more info about execution environment here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/95">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574/95</a>
 eulerscheZahl: easy to write such a bundler on your own if you don't do fancy stuff in your code
 Swagboy: If you use C++, just compile with -E -P
 Swagboy: it gives you preprocessing output
 eulerscheZahl: my c# bundler, which i run as a post-build event in my IDE:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7a251267-e56f-45b5-80c2-b882f7fb7aca">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7a251267-e56f-45b5-80c2-b882f7fb7aca</a>
 Swagboy: I should use a real IDE on day
 eulerscheZahl: far away from brilliant but does the job for me
 Swagboy: What's yours eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: MonoDevelop
 eulerscheZahl: i'm on linux, otherwise it would be visual studio for C#
 Zenoscave: I use vscode
 Astrobytes: Never consider running a cheapo win box just for VS euler?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm fine with monodevelop
 eulerscheZahl: i installed VS code as illedan wanted to try liveshare for hashcode
 eulerscheZahl: didn't work that well. whenever i scrolled, his code duplicated
 Astrobytes: VS Code has a liveshare? Didn't know that
 Astrobytes: Oh lol, works well then
 eulerscheZahl: so he had the same block of lines about 10 times :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: and then my VS code crashed
 Astrobytes: Seems legit :D
 eulerscheZahl: and illedan was like "wtf is that?" (we spoke on discord the same time)
 eulerscheZahl: for those not on discord: "by the way, there will be prizes for this challenge. Same as for previous challenges"
 Astrobytes: ffs you literally beat me to it
 eulerscheZahl: haha
 Astrobytes: jeez
 eulerscheZahl: but you saw it on discord before me
 Astrobytes: 1 keystroke away!! Yeah, and STILL you beat me
 kovi: top10 was sorted by country
 eulerscheZahl: how do you sort countries?by population? alphabet? average life expectancy?
 kovi: well french and japan grouped together
 eulerscheZahl: but your hungarian friends aren't in top10 anymore
 kovi: true&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and now i have to gain 6 spots to monday
 Nerchio: so i can win a tshirt in this contest if i do well?
 Nerchio: :D
 eulerscheZahl: top20
 AntiSquid: kovi -&gt; the last hungarian
 AntiSquid: coming to the cinemas this winter
 Zenoscave: I'd watch the kovi movie
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSEAg41bQIRAF6vMRBtgq2L3kcIP8egxQb6nNIsKvw08D3X57n&amp;s">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSEAg41bQIRAF6vMRBtgq2L3kcIP8egxQb6nNIsKvw08D3X57n&amp;s</a>

 Zenoscave: I want that shurt
 Zenoscave: shirt
 eulerscheZahl: and there's a 3rd design to choose from
 AntiSquid: i have it 
 eulerscheZahl: quite new, a rubiks cube
 Zenoscave: Is the rubiks cube melting?
 Nerchio: damn need to improve my bot then
 Nerchio: i want a tshirt too :D
 AntiSquid: are there prizes for this contest?
 Nerchio: i think so
 Zenoscave: Yes anti
 eulerscheZahl: not melting, bottom part is twisted
 Zenoscave: look on discord
 AntiSquid: oh
 Astrobytes: Yes squid, Thibaud casually mentioned it on discord
 Nerchio: "by the way, there will be prizes for this challenge. Same as for previous challenges"
 AntiSquid: lol but no mention on the site?
 eulerscheZahl: a bit like this one but different (old design) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnaTzkeW8AAxiWQ.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnaTzkeW8AAxiWQ.jpg</a>
 AntiSquid: Today at 19:40 - by the way, there will be prizes for this challenge. Same as for previous challenges
 AntiSquid: good he mentioned it early during contest
 eulerscheZahl: 20:40 in his timezone
 Nerchio: yea but maybe they didn't know if they can offer any prizes so they didnt say it
 Nerchio: consider it a nice gesture
 AntiSquid: maybe
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair: last Sunday he didn't know himself if there will be prizes
 Astrobytes: Yeah they said at the start they weren't sure
 Zenoscave: Thanks thibaud
 Zenoscave: sincerely
 eulerscheZahl: and they still weren't till recentlyso a nice surprise, no reason to be mad for the late announcement
 AntiSquid: well nobody played for prizes anyway
 AntiSquid: i am not mad though
 eulerscheZahl: true, CG is always a big fun
 Zenoscave: I did. Been aiming for the shot at a shirt from the get go. Top 20 has been m goal this whole time
 eulerscheZahl: you are trying this for &gt; 2 years
 Astrobytes: ZenosCrave
 eulerscheZahl: that's dedicatoin
 ZarthaxX: and me? lmao
 Zenoscave: I started in 2013
 Astrobytes: Shhh ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: late 20113
 Zenoscave: tr -s 1
 Astrobytes: He's from the future :o
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Nerchio: last hour of the contest everyone will be submitting
 Nerchio: the servers will crash
 NormantasStankevicius: ahhh worked many hours, reworked a good portion of my strategy, cannot get out of silver
 eulerscheZahl: he's trying longer than CG even exists :o
 NormantasStankevicius: How do you counter the insane amount of silence predictions?
 Zenoscave: I'm not sure of the year then
 Astrobytes: I started 2015 sometimes
 Astrobytes: *sometime
 Zenoscave: ekul was my first account. now it smurfs
 ZarthaxX: and your deleted zeno
 eulerscheZahl: what was your first contest? mine was hypersonic
 Nerchio: ocean of code
 Nerchio: back in 2020
 Zenoscave: I don't remember
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: those were times
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: crazy times
 ZarthaxX: *oh wait*
 eulerscheZahl: i still remember as if it was just yesterday
 Astrobytes: :D
 Nerchio: i destroyed my finisher move code it will be a pain to fix
 eulerscheZahl: when i joined, there were 2 contests running at the same time. Hypersonic and The Accountant
 Nerchio: meanwhile kovi has such clean finisher from every position
 ZarthaxX: the only contest i missed :c
 Nerchio: or seems like it
 lhm: Does the contest end today?
 eulerscheZahl: i skipped TAC as well. exam time
 eulerscheZahl: monday
 Astrobytes: I didn't notice contests when I first joined up, then was away for ages until I remembered to come back
 lhm: I feel like I should spend more time on it
 eulerscheZahl: but you can keep playing it in the multiplayer section
 lhm: Thanks eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: just without prizes
 ZarthaxX: and with copypasters
 lhm: Im not playing for prizes and will not get any anyways&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: u are lvl 32
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 eulerscheZahl: i'm copy-pasting the whole time.IDE -&gt; WebsiteWebsite -&gt; diff tool ("what did i just break")
 ZarthaxX: lol
 lhm: I do not understand your point ZarthaxX
 eulerscheZahl: he says you are good and know how to code
 ZarthaxX: thanks for the translation
 eulerscheZahl: or that he hasn't seen you before and now he's wondering how he could miss a lvl32 player
 Zenoscave: I think the second
 ZarthaxX: and also that
 lhm: Well, good enough for gold but so far away from legend
 ZarthaxX: u can still try
 lhm: I did, went gold
 ZarthaxX: mor
 ZarthaxX: e
 Zenoscave: MORE
 Nerchio: in this game if you are top10 gold i suggest just spam submitting until you get it xD
 lhm: You did not miss me, im not talking much and im here for less than a year&#160;:)
 lhm: If im top 300 gold, spam might not be enough haha
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Zenoscave: 08/13/2015 @ 7:08pm (UTC) Is my best guess one when I joined
 Zenoscave: 04/10/2018 @ 10:37pm (UTC)
 Zenoscave: New estimate
 AntiSquid: when were you born?
 Zenoscave: one of those seems wrong
 Zenoscave: i estimate 1995
 AntiSquid: time of the day
 AntiSquid: in seconds
 Zenoscave: No idea
 AntiSquid: what's your linux clock
 Zenoscave: wasn't there
 ZarthaxX: you rejoined Zenoscave when you deleted your acc&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: ohhhhhh
 Astrobytes: You weren't present at your own birth Zeno? :P
 Zenoscave: I do hear stories though
 Astrobytes: lol
 Zenoscave: Countries rejoiced and leaders wept
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: he was in his mother's womb for 20 years and after that a portal opened and he walked out into this world
 Nerchio: do you think if i submit enough times i can get top5 in legend
 Zenoscave: no
 Zenoscave: not possible Nerchio
 mlomb: how much is *enough* for you
 Nerchio: i believe statistics are in my favour
 Zenoscave: Have you played against top 5?
 Zenoscave: I'd say otherwise if you haen't
 NormantasStankevicius: why does my broken code work better than better one?:cry:
 Zenoscave: 2nd in C#
 Zenoscave:&#160;!!!!
 NormantasStankevicius: nice!
 Astrobytes: Who's 1st? Illedan?
 Nerchio: legend people are boring
 Zenoscave: mhm
 Nerchio: almost everyone in C++
 ZarthaxX: euler
 Zenoscave: nope
 Zenoscave: euler is 3rd&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: ah u are 28
 ZarthaxX: what did u do
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: illo
 Zenoscave: i had a break instead of a continue
 ZarthaxX: lmao what
 Zenoscave: it was a major issue
 Zenoscave: probably have a few more
 Zenoscave: Nerchio top 20! GZ
 Nerchio: i was actually top13 i think after first auto-commit in legend
 Nerchio: after getting 
 Nerchio: to legend
 Astrobytes: He got to 14th or 15th on his gold-beating submit Zeno
 Nerchio: i can end anywhere between top10 and top 50 
 Nerchio: i dont consider my bot to be very good
 Astrobytes: gz for that Nerchio btw&#160;:)
 Nerchio: ty
 Zenoscave: find the bugs. I have more faith in your top 5 with this knowledge
 Nerchio: i think everyone including myself underestimate this if-monster
 eulerscheZahl: above Zenoscave again \o/
 blasterpoard: imho everyone underestimates what will happen during the last few days
 Zenoscave: BAD EULER
 eulerscheZahl: i don't, saw it often enough
 blasterpoard: we'll have at least 5 new contenders for top10
 eulerscheZahl: dropped from top10 below 50 at hypersonic
 eulerscheZahl: (to be fair, that was an 8 day contest)
 eulerscheZahl: i expect blasterpoard to improve a lot on the weekend or even monday morning
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that karlis o is hiding and will join last minute. he became first in onitama yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: and i expect myself to qualify for codejam round 2
 Astrobytes: Since he gave a flat "no" as to whether he'd participate you're most likely right
 Zenoscave: reCurse joining when?&#160;;) 
 Zenoscave: sorry for ping
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't online when that happened
 Zenoscave: must ask
 eulerscheZahl: recurs e refused to give a statement
 Astrobytes: Was talking with Smits iirc euler
 Nerchio: hehe
 Nerchio: its funny to play vs GiB
 AntiSquid: karl said he doesn't play
 Nerchio: my number of agents and possible locations are exact match with this just 1 turn difference ofc
 Nerchio: with his*
 Nerchio: i guess its the same with everyone nvm
 Nerchio: xD
 Nerchio: but its the first time i noticed this after i fixed too many objects i was creating with silence
 Zenoscave: Is anyone else getting timeouts in first turn?
 gaha: happens once in a while
 Zenoscave: 50% of my losses ...
 gaha: sometimes my timer says I finished in 0.03s but I get a timeout anyway
 AntiSquid: check discord regarding this Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: just did Anti
 gaha: what is there on discord on it?
 AntiSquid: the Loch Ness monster unrefutable evidence
 AntiSquid: it eats your sub
 Zenoscave: Server timeouts from compilation
 AntiSquid: irrefutable *
 gaha: huh, compilation
 gaha: my python code doesn't know what it is
 duckymirror: I got an email yesterday about a new school leaderboard and the "CodinGame Spring Challenge". What confuses me is that it doesn't have the usual CodinGame design. Is it official or just spam?
 eulerscheZahl: official
 duckymirror: Okay, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/top-schools/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/top-schools/global</a>
 duckymirror: I don't like clicking links in these cases :grin:
 duckymirror: I mean links in emails
 eulerscheZahl: not even linked, you have to copy-paste it from the email
 eulerscheZahl: once i got a spam email from someone imposing as CG
 duckymirror: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they got my email address from github. at least it's not the one i use on CG
 duckymirror: Then it's probably better to ask
 eulerscheZahl: there was a forum post about it
 AntiSquid: do you need to participate in a CG contest to get your degree at Wroclaw&#160;?
 Astrobytes: euler *posing as/impersonating
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, me no English
 Astrobytes: lol, if I was talking German I'd expect people to correct me&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: genau
 AntiSquid: idk, depends on the chat
 AntiSquid: you might get hdf and deine mudda is something instead
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKEKukDycMo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKEKukDycMo</a>
 Nerchio: i've heard they have this contest as an additional thing for an AI class or something in Wroclaw :p
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Zenoscave: Apple pen
 Zenoscave: haven't heard that in a while
 MSmits: never had this before:
 MSmits: munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
 AntiSquid: new achievement unlocked then
 MSmits: yeah!
 AntiSquid: time to go out and party MSmits
 MSmits: no party before i get my fatality check working
 Astrobytes: deleted an invalid pointer?
 MSmits: coded all of it, now debugging it
 MSmits: maybe
 Astrobytes: Or changed it's address and deleted
 MSmits: can this happen when you popback an empty vector?
 Nerchio: how lovely i dont have to deal with this
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think so
 eulerscheZahl: it's c++, everything can happen
 Astrobytes: Ask re Curse
 MSmits: thats probably it then
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't be surprised if you manage to physically delete your computer
 MSmits: i recently started using vectors for things
 MSmits: I'll try eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: no promises
 blasterpoard: anything can happen with vectors... I once saw a vector destructor cause a double free
 MSmits: whats a double free?
 blasterpoard: you free the same memory twice
 Astrobytes: Trying to free the same chunk of memory twice
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: it's extra free then
 Astrobytes: That would be nice, but no
 MSmits: what happens when you do this?
 ZarthaxX: die
 blasterpoard: if you're lucky
 Astrobytes: Bad Things™
 blasterpoard: you might as well corrupt the heap and randomly crash 200 lines later
 MSmits: hm ok
 ZarthaxX: the pointer could point to some new memory you allocated too MSmits
 ZarthaxX: imagine the posibilities
 ZarthaxX: :D
 blasterpoard: it was especially fun when it happened in the destructor and I spent several hours looking for it
 ZarthaxX: imean the same address reused
 MSmits: horror stories
 MSmits: this is why we should all be using Rust
 MSmits: rust means peace in Dutch
 MSmits: it would give us peace
 Astrobytes: These are the fairy tales that seasoned devs tell their kids at night
 MSmits: nightmares
 SapphireLight: yeeeah
 blasterpoard: but C++ gives us speed
 blasterpoard: and bots that we can test against in IDE
 MSmits: ah yeah, it was the vector. I forgot to add something to it earlier and i did remember to remove it after (recursive function)
 Zenoscave: my german teacher insisted i know the word frommfor some reason
 Zenoscave: fromm*
 MSmits: whats that
 MSmits: why does it have an extra m&#160;?
 Nerchio: feelsbad to code when my ide has slower typing with this many lines idk
 MSmits: bug in the language?
 Astrobytes: It's like devout or pious
 Zenoscave: yes
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: vroom
 MSmits: in Dutch
 MSmits: with a proper amount of m's
 MSmits: that is
 MSmits: 1
 Astrobytes: But that extra o
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: the extra o makes you pronounce it as froam, one o would make it soudn like from
 Astrobytes: I know. It just makes me laugh
 MSmits: lol ok
 Astrobytes: stroopwafel
 MSmits: right that&#160;:)
 MSmits: how much Dutch do you know
 Counterbalance: it's better than english where any vowel can be pronounced as any random vowel depending on the word
 Astrobytes: That's about it
 MSmits: ah ok
 Zenoscave: jag
 MSmits: Counterbalance agreed
 MSmits: also dependent on the dialect
 Astrobytes: Yes Counterbalance, agreed
 Zenoscave: Agreed
 MSmits: Australian, Scottish, Irish, British etc.
 Astrobytes: English is fking mental
 Astrobytes: It makes a modicum of sense up to a point then just goes a bit haywire
 MSmits: most languages probably have features like that
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/680736db-a84d-4c83-a3f0-c49a3be3dc2b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/680736db-a84d-4c83-a3f0-c49a3be3dc2b</a>
 Astrobytes: Of course all languages have exceptions, English just does it... differently :D
 MSmits: i think the fact that CG thinks you're spamming says enough Zenoscave
 Counterbalance: heh yeah Zenoscave
 Astrobytes: spot on Zeno
 Zenoscave: That is one of my favorite quotes about the language
 Counterbalance: Dutch-english vowels: i is pronounced a, a is pronounced as e, e is pronounced as i
 MSmits: very confusing and funny to hear when Dutch people barely speak English
 Counterbalance: the ebc
 Astrobytes: This also changes when you're Scottish and trying to learn languages
 Astrobytes: Because we say our vowels very differently from the traditional English
 Counterbalance: I'm wondering whether I should resubmit..
 Counterbalance: boss has 3pt lead
 Zenoscave: feking right you do
 Astrobytes: fecking is Irish tho
 Astrobytes: :D
 Zenoscave: I feel ashamed
 Zenoscave: i'll leave now
 Astrobytes: I have Irish relatives, it's ok
 RavenKZP: Some bot is Gold is not random?!
 Zenoscave: same legend
 LouysPatriceBessette: Hello all I have an issue with no save/submit changes about the nickname, bio and city location in the settings. Is it me? (lol)
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance i was 3 points behind boss and magically promoted 12 hs later
 ZarthaxX: but i wouldnt try that
 ZarthaxX: you dont have zeno anymore there spamming for you&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: I already waited 12h.. was at rank 21, now at 4
 ZarthaxX: oh amazing lol
 ZarthaxX: just improve then mmh
 Counterbalance: yeah I have a 10-15% winrate improvement ready.. I think I'll go for it
 ZarthaxX: gogogogo
 Counterbalance: not sure I like being bottom legend though&#160;;)
 MSmits: I just passed 2k lines =/
 ZarthaxX: are you insulting me?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 MSmits: it's odd how these seemingly simple games make you code so much
 Nerchio: i have 2700
 Counterbalance: im at 3300.. had to remove code twice already to remain under 100k
 Nerchio: lets measure our length guys
 Nerchio: counterbalance the longest so far
 Zenoscave: 1060
 Counterbalance: lol
 Nerchio: so short?
 Nerchio: zenos :x
 Zenoscave: can we measure by submits instead?
 gaha: what, is there 100k characters limit, not lines?
 MSmits: yes gaha
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: dont even try Zenoscave
 MSmits: you know you can make 3k lines fit on 1 line right
 Nanosplitter: ^
 gaha: will have to remove comments soon xd
 Counterbalance: yeah, i have some comments too - bad practice 
 Nerchio: using comments in your code?
 Nerchio: wtf!
 Nerchio: what is this magic
 MSmits: only contest where i had to do that was  code a la mode
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl ded?
 MSmits: sleeping probably
 Counterbalance: only 24k gzipped.. if they counted gzipped size, it'd be much better
 MSmits: yeah
 Nerchio: 89200 chars&#160;;/ getting close
 MSmits: you can do a minification
 Counterbalance: gunzip - - | &lt;&lt;EOM; g++ - &gt; /tmp/Answer.exe &amp;&amp; /tmp/Answer.exe
 MSmits: just dont make it unreadable
 MSmits: thats not allowed
 MSmits: fatalityMap -&gt; fatMap  etc.
 Astrobytes: *fatalityMap -&gt; f
 Nerchio: lol
 YannT: 26k chars
 YannT: maybe that's what's wrong, need more code
 Nerchio: my stuff is actually very verbose but i am bad at this
 AntiSquid: don't think my code is readable
 Nerchio: i have countAllPossibleEnemyLocations()
 Nerchio: xD
 Nerchio: method
 YannT: I'm up to 650 lines now , obviously it's not enough
 AntiSquid: i can barely read my code
 YannT:  // TODO: Add more line returns for better ranking
 MSmits: thats pretty amazing YannT
 MSmits: to do that well with so little code
 YannT: well it's not all me, kotlin is also a very dense language
 MSmits: oh yeah
 Counterbalance: grep TODO main.cpp | wc -l37
 AntiSquid: no i think it proves most bots might be doing useless sorting and searches
 YannT: val positionsCount = possibilities.distinctBy { it.last() }.size
 YannT: in C++ that's like 100 lines right there
 YannT: :p
 YannT: my sonar handling (when getting sonared, or sonaring) is also a one liner
 YannT: possibilities.removeIf { (it.last().sector()&#160;!= sector) == sonarResult }
 MSmits: probably
 Zenoscave: shouldn't that be&#160;!= sonarResult?
 Zenoscave: ah&#160;!= sector nvmd
 MSmits: what really bloats my code is all those times I do the same thing for 4 directions
 Swagboy: Hard to cut on those tho
 MSmits: yeah I know it's possible
 MSmits: but havent done it, too much work also
 MSmits: and causes bugs, i already know that
 YannT: I actually wrote a kind of bool table to make sure I got that one right Zenoscave, I wasn't confident at all with doing the logic in my head, that's like a double to triple negation with the removeIf Oo
 Zenoscave: right!
 TheHotTopHat_917b: how to print something?
 YannT: CTRL+P
 Astrobytes: print("something")
 TheHotTopHat_917b: ty
 KobeL: Streaming over at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings">https://www.twitch.tv/saintplaysthings</a>Doing some code clashes, feel free to hop in and say hi!
 Nerchio: btw the numbers of moves you can do is kinda crazy
 Nerchio: silence w 1 move nws
 Nerchio: silence w2 move nws
 Nerchio: etc
 Nerchio: for finishers i mean
 MSmits: I just finished my fatality function and it was not easy indeed
 wlesavo: grac
 MSmits: well it might still have bugs. Havent been able to test silence yet, but move/trigger/torpedo seems to work
 Tetano: hi guys, how can i use the debugg comand?
 MSmits: the trick is to filter for torpedo and mine locations, dont just allow triggering every mine and firing torpedos everywhere
 MSmits: I seem to be losing a lot of games on my first submit test, so I am still bugged
 MSmits: nah it was unlucky, so far I see no bugs. Fatality is working. I just use abilities badly , so i never seem to have a silence ready to dash with
 MSmits: definitely seems to have helped, but it's not a miracle cure. I need more to get legend
 AntiSquid: ladder is random MSmits
 AntiSquid: your current submit might as well rank 10-20 lower, that's how random it is
 Nerchio: i have a question
 Nerchio: you can do a bfs for torpedos for the whole map in the first turn
 Nerchio: but how would you store it?
 MSmits: i know AntiSquid, but before i improved this I was 30-50
 MSmits: so pretty sure it helped
 AntiSquid: i tell you after contest nerchio if someone else doesn't do it first
 MSmits: damn I should do that
 AntiSquid: MSmits same bot ranked #12 and #45 for me just saying
 MSmits: sure
 Nerchio: i mean its not that important is it? :p
 AntiSquid: it saves time Nerchio
 Nerchio: kk np
 MSmits: yes
 Nerchio: i dont really need it but its annoying to write bfs(all the variables for it) everywhere xD
 darkhorse64: nerchio, store it at each cell of your grid
 MSmits: I don't have a grid, but I could just make an array of target maps
 MSmits: targetMaps[225]
 darkhorse64: I have 10 flavors of bfs in my code
 Nerchio: array of arrays
 Nerchio: so lame&#160;:(
 MSmits: I don't bfs
 MSmits: I floodfill to get the torpedo map
 MSmits: 4 floodfill iterations 
 MSmits: on a uint16_t[15] array
 darkhorse64: floodfill = bfs for me. Is there really a difference&#160;?
 MSmits: bfs stores parents to track back a path
 MSmits: you're just coloring a map with a floodfill
 MSmits: not looking for any specific destination or path
 MSmits: it's not a big difference
 darkhorse64: OK. I have also a dijkstra
 MSmits: but in my case it is, because my floodfill is on a bitboard, I wouldnt be able to bfs like this
 Astrobytes: floodfill can be bfs or dfs or whatever, I use bfs. bfs with no target destination
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5e42ba67-4e5b-448e-a17e-c5ce84a030ed">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5e42ba67-4e5b-448e-a17e-c5ce84a030ed</a>
 MSmits: floodfill a map in all directions once
 MSmits: do this 4 times and you have your torpedo map
 darkhorse64: Apart from the point of view of compactness, is there a real advantage to bitboarding&#160;? More speed to resist silence spammers&#160;?
 payroll-beats: Did anybody solve the order of succession puzzle
 MSmits: not sure darkhorse64, I've used bitboards so often now with those boardgames, it feels more natural to use them
 payroll-beats: Im a noob just want to know if I need to understand the Tree data structure 
 MSmits: sorry, dont remember that puzzle
 darkhorse64: my bot is based on STL sets and can handle several thousands paths
 payroll-beats: Thank you 
 MSmits: what are STL sets?
 MSmits: I can handle 40k or so I think? Not sure, i dont time out anyway
 darkhorse64: Standard Template Library
 MSmits: oh
 Zenoscave: #include &lt;set&gt;
 MSmits: I think right now I need to use some strategy on using abilities
 pb4: darkhorse64&#160;: there's a convenience factor with bitboards
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: Why don't you timeout&#160;? You reset paths&#160;?
 MSmits: what kind of situation should make me timeout?
 darkhorse64: Too mzny paths
 darkhorse64: *many*
 darkhorse64: 40k is huge. That's why you don't timeout
 MSmits: I do have a pruning function that worked superbly well when I was ignoring mines, i still have it, not sure if it ever kicks in now
 darkhorse64: "convenience factor"
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MSmits: or if it is bugged
 pb4: calculate hit probability
 MSmits: I do that
 pb4: (presenceMap &amp; boomMap).popCount() / presenceMap.popCount()
 MSmits: yeah I am doing this wrong I think
 MSmits: I am counting every possible location as 1
 MSmits: not counting how many times it occurs
 MSmits: btw, i do this right in mine avoidances
 MSmits: just not in torpedoing and triggering
 MSmits: so there could be 2 locations that each occur once and 1 location that occurs 100 times
 MSmits: and I would not shoot at it
 MSmits: because 1/3 chance
 darkhorse64: Funny that when I code a board game, bitboarding is turned on in my mind but not for other games
 pb4: I just use those masks everywhere
 MSmits: 1/4 of my code is helper functions for clearing maps, doing &amp; operation on two maps, or |= operation etc.
 Beerus: does anyone used minimax?
 MSmits: not here
 MSmits: I use beamsearch for mine avoidance. A recursive brute force search for fatality checks
 MSmits: and tracking is a big thing also, processing opponent orders and eliminating impossible states
 MSmits: I still dont use minimax in any real sense on CG... I always gravitate to mcts or similar
 Beerus: can you go legend with good tracking?
 MSmits: not with just good tracking no
 MSmits: you need more
 MSmits: mine avoidance, some strategy on ability use
 Beerus: can you go legend without mine avoidance
 MSmits: doubt it
 darkhorse64: no
 Beerus: you cant check for every possible mine position
 Beerus: its dangerous to surface if you do
 MSmits: btw darkhorse64, you can favor sonar use if you see your pathcount rise too much
 MSmits: i dont do that, but it makes sense
 MSmits: Beerus you record positions from which mines were laid for each possible state you are keeping
 darkhorse64: I have tuned my bot to use less silence in order not to timeout myself&#160;!
 MSmits: oh, selftracking
 MSmits: i dont have that yet
 MSmits: its high on my list
 darkhorse64: You need it. Do it now
 MSmits: first I will fix my hit probability function. I think gold boss beats me every time by shooting better
 MSmits: I would not know how to use the information currently
 Zenoscave: I broke something
 MSmits: need to think about that also
 darkhorse64: This is where I am weak
 Beerus: why use hit probability?
 Beerus: hit if your are sure or not
 Nerchio: zenos all good
 Nerchio: free points
 Zenoscave: You hit too infreqently if you don't
 Beerus: if you hit and miss opponent detects you
 MSmits: if you have a 80% chance to hit and you miss, you pretty much know exactly where he is next turn
 MSmits: unless silence 
 MSmits: there is some luck involved. 80% is good odds
 AntiSquid: CG poker multi :thinking:
 Zenoscave: I accidentally turned of silence
 AntiSquid: and your sub was playing guitar
 Nerchio: lol
 MSmits: man i am getting tired, i's are starting to look like j's 
 AntiSquid: i have i2, j2 and k and k2 in there
 AntiSquid: and idx es
 AntiSquid: and i have p for player 
 Nerchio: i had 4 nested loops
 Nerchio: i , j and then w , z
 Nerchio: the master of loops
 MSmits: heh, I remember my first real program.  I was  coding vba in excel to automatically create excel files, I had, i,j,k,l,m,n,io,p,q,r I think
 AntiSquid: i have 5 for my silence function
 Nerchio: :D
 MSmits: I returned to this program 2 years later to rewrite it and I had no idea what it did
 Nerchio: hey i found your loop do you want it xD
 AntiSquid: lots of 4 for nested loops
 AntiSquid: it's mainly the structure that i use i guess
 icecream17: I lost against this person when submitting. So I sent it to the IDE..... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/451563264">https://www.codingame.com/replay/451563264</a>
 MSmits: it might go different in the ide when you hit play again
 MSmits: if people use random 
 MSmits: or if people use full calculation time and it hits the timeout limit
 MSmits: they cut short their search and there is a different result
 rwilson: icecream17&#160;;) unlucky random initial placement ...  fun
 MSmits: oh didnt look at the game, yeah thats something to fix :0
 MSmits: I just floodfill all my starts
 MSmits: if any have less than max, I dont consider them
 rwilson: nice&#160;;) better than NOTHING&#160;;) which i think a lot of folks still get by with purely ...   random(x,y)!=isLand
 MSmits: i tried other ways
 MSmits: didn't help
 MSmits: I'll try again I guess, might depend on meta
 icecream17: If less than 2 water next to it, not available water space
 icecream17: Might eliminate a bit more than neccesary but good enough....
 MSmits: I did a short of weighted floodfill with nearby cells weighing more than far away cells
 MSmits: that way it prefers movement space
 MSmits: I am top 10 gold&#160;:)
 MSmits: fixing hit probability helped
 AntiSquid: gn8 folks, i'll try to dream my bot into legend
 MSmits: gn AntiSquid
 MSmits: thanks pb4
 Nerchio: bye
 MSmits: that little hint about hit probability saved my ass. Very close to legend
 rwilson: anyone had luck  adding some voronoi like features yet?
 MSmits: not me
 Nerchio: MSmits my floodfill prefers squares closer to otehr squares
 Nerchio: :p
 MSmits: kinda depends on how you define voronoi
 Nerchio: works similar probably
 MSmits: 5 wins in a row vs gold boss on legend. Rank 2 now
 MSmits: on gold i mean
 MSmits: come on!
 MSmits: so close
 rwilson: nice&#160;;)
 MSmits: 2 more wins vs gold boss and I'm out
 MSmits: need some luck
 rwilson: or a submit bump from someone&#160;;) 
 MSmits: yes or that
 MSmits: crap, not gonna make it 
 YannT: yo weighted floodfill!
 YannT: I don't have that, now that's an idea&#160;:)
 MSmits: didnt work for me the first time i tried
 MSmits: but my bot had other problems then
 Astrobytes: Like a Dijkstra?
 Nerchio: i tried weights also
 Nerchio: but i didnt implement that properly
 Nerchio: so i gave up
 Nerchio: xD
 YannT: I'm thinking just manhattan distance is enough
 YannT: close squares more valuable
 YannT: it should work
 MSmits: YannT a question for you then
 MSmits: Is it better to start in open spaces?
 pb4: YannT&#160;: don't even try it
 pb4: -_-
 YannT: doesn't work pb4?
 MSmits: maybe that means it does :P
 YannT: MSmits: I think as long as you don't screw yourself, placement doesn't matter terribly much
 MSmits: I only need a small boost, I am just below gold boss 
 YannT: I benched around that, don't think it has any impact as long as you don't pick the obviously bad placements
 MSmits: what are obviously bad places?
 YannT: lakes
 YannT: and tunnels
 Nerchio: MSmits i was below gold boss 20 times before i advanced :D
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: Nerchio I am 0.42 below gold boss
 MSmits: thats not much
 YannT: middle of the biggest sea tends to work best because it makes initial detection slower
 MSmits: I'll try it then
 YannT: but the impact as opposed to starting in the corner of the biggest sea or something is really minimal
 icecream17: That should be another type: Detection Avoider
 YannT: another thing is since everyone has a "start in the middeish of the biggest sea" type algo, you will start close to opponents more often than not (if not on the same square)
 YannT: so your bot has to be good at fighting otherwise all your games will be short&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah i see
 YannT: it can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on if you're best at torpedoing or building mine castles in your corner
 MSmits: I have no idea what I am best at
 Zenoscave: YannT what's the secret to fights?
 Zenoscave: simu?
 icecream17: I start in the 7th available space (excluding 1-width oceans)
 MSmits: oddly specific
 icecream17: Fights... torpedo &amp; charge, charge, charge &amp; torpedo
 YannT: Zenoscave: I have an eval + some rules, but I'm sure most of the top bots wrote some kind of fighting minmax
 Zenoscave: fighting minimax&#160;:/ no time for that unless I do it tomorrow
 icecream17: It usually starts around the top-middle
 YannT: if both positions are known, you can "solve" the fight
 icecream17: No... theres ilence
 YannT: I didn't do it though, but I'm sure others have
 YannT: not usually
 Zenoscave: no silence once a fight starts up here. too many charges needed
 YannT: once silence has been burned, you have 10ish turns of just charging torpedo, moving and shooting torpedo
 YannT: and usually the positions are known at that point
 icecream17: Nah, half the time opponent escapes
 YannT: so you can "solve" the fight
 YannT: yeah I'm not saying it for handling a driveby
 Nerchio: it's definitely solvable
 Nerchio: but too complex 
 Nerchio: :D
 YannT: but you'll notice most games end with an exchange of torpedoes over 10ish turns, and usually the winner is decided by like one turn (i.e the loser needed just one turn to charge and win)
 YannT: so it's often kinda close
 YannT: and you can optimize this and turn a loss into a win
 YannT: maybe with a smart move, or siomething
 MSmits: sounds like a multi-turn fatality check
 YannT: that's what it is
 MSmits: I already had some problems just getting the 1 turn working :P
 YannT: you just have toi minmax moves and torpedoes with both positions being known
 MSmits: what about silence and mines?
 YannT: silence is burned at the beginning of the "fight" usually
 MSmits: hm ok
 YannT: then it's just moves and torpedoes until someone dies (or escapes)
 icecream17: there should be a statistics thing, like a "death by mine, torpedo, error, and surface" chart
 YannT: I don't know of bots that don't charge torpedo as a first priority
 icecream17: I think I charge mine too early
 icecream17: Like, after 7 no-shots or so I charge mine....
 Zenoscave: lucky submit
 MSmits: whose?
 Zenoscave: mine
 blasterpoard: YannT about the combat sim - this is what it looks like when my bot in development fights my leaderboard bot:
 blasterpoard: www.codingame.com/replay/451575664
 vbplaya: I'm confused on how to properly use mines
 blasterpoard: the mine was lucky, but it's still quite good
 Zenoscave: what turn look ahead do you need to see before you get improvement blasterpoard?
 YannT: blasterpoard: basically mines killed you so this is not really a good demo&#160;;)
 blasterpoard: YannT I meant the first 2 torpedos + silence
 YannT: I see&#160;:)
 YannT: I know siman and kovi have a thing like that because they use SURFACE when it makes no sense sometimes in combat
 YannT: it must be because they combat minmax establish that with access to that tile they'll win for sure or something
 MSmits: why do they use ot?
 MSmits: ah
 Astrobytes: Freedom of movement
 YannT: like surface to sidestep and maybe then fire a torpedo before moving so you get that extra charge that lets you win
 YannT: things like that
 Zenoscave: does all of legend recalc? or just top 20
 icecream17: How to use mines? Place randomly is pretty good - I haven't seen anyone use actual pattern and strategy with it
 MSmits: top 100 I thought?
 YannT: here's a trick with mine
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/451578099">https://www.codingame.com/replay/451578099</a> here's another then YannT
 blasterpoard: moving to the same square as opponent so he can't hit me
 blasterpoard: that's advanced enough I think
 YannT: if you place them in such a way that one one laying position can pontentially have laid 2 mines
 YannT: it can't be removed on trigger&#160;:)
 YannT: I didn't implement this but I always thought that could be a good idea to screw with the opponent :p
 MSmits: it can be removed on 2 triggers
 YannT: yes
 YannT: but on one trigger, you have to keep both, or guesstimate something, either way it's not ideal
 MSmits: well.. I ended below boss again
 MSmits: with my start in the middle policy
 MSmits: with a worse rating, slightly less success, but not significant
 Febrin: Nice MSmits I see u are second
 MSmits: yeah
 Febrin: What have u implemented today
 Febrin: I am still fighting with smart finisher
 MSmits: fatality and better hit probability
 MSmits: smart finisher is a lot of work
 YannT: I'm just about to test your weighted floodfill idea&#160;:)
 MSmits: doesnt do anything for me, hope it helps you
 Febrin: How do you hi smart?
 Febrin: Kind of probability heat map?
 MSmits: when i said smart finisher i just meant the kill shot
 vbplaya: I guess what confuses me about the mines is that they don't trigger when the sub goes across it. 
 MSmits: hitting smart would mean counting all possible states and getting a probability for each tile
 MSmits: then hit the tile with the highest expected damage
 MSmits: before I had each possible tile counting as equal (as long as the opponent could be there)
 MSmits: now I also take into account the number of states I have on that tile
 MSmits: so positions that occur more often have a higher probability.
 icecream17: I take each possShoot and have an array h for each. Each opponent position life lost = h++
 icecream17: Special things like "original" array and "corners / middle" bonus, and decrease greatly if shoot myself.... 
 ZarthaxX: MSmits that doesnt seem like it could be right
 ZarthaxX: mhm
 MSmits: what do you mean
 ZarthaxX: well depends on tracker i guess
 ZarthaxX: nvm
 MSmits: yeah
 YannT: MSmits: it's interesting I'd say
 YannT: it gives me a more zigzagish type of movement
 MSmits: huh... the weighted floodfill was only supposed to be used for selecting the start location
 MSmits: what did you use it for
 YannT: calculating space after move&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well that works too
 YannT: that way it likes to zigzag more
 YannT: which is usually good
 MSmits: zigzag is good?
 MSmits: you dodge torpedoes that way?
 YannT: you more around in a more "compact" manner which tends to be good
 YannT: for minimizing ennemy detection, and staying more in your "territory"
 MSmits: ahh ok
 YannT: I'll bench it&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 YannT: 1.0 - (distanceTo(start) / 50.0).coerceAtMost(.5)
 YannT: I but kinda random numbers that look pretty :p
 MSmits: thats important
 YannT: before the value of a given square was just 1.0
 MSmits: if the numbers look crap, then the bot is crap
 MSmits: I like 8 especially. It has good symmetry
 YannT: multiples of 5 and even numbers are the best obviously
 MSmits: mmh I agree
 YannT: anything else just looks wrong
 MSmits: I never did well in a contest where I had constants ending with 3
 MSmits: just fyi
 YannT: it's exactly like how you'll never put your TV's volume to like "17", that would be insane
 MSmits: in my case my wife would kill me so yeah
 YannT: you'll make it work on 15 or worse case scenario 18
 YannT: it's not good&#160;:(
 MSmits: ah well, another thing to take off the list
 YannT: I'll let it run more in case it's bad luck but not looking good&#160;:/
 MSmits: who are you running it against?
 YannT: top5
 MSmits: ah ok
 YannT: I usually bench around 40-50% against that test set
 MSmits: I see
 icecream17: 3978 minutes left for the contest! Less than 4000 minutes
 MSmits: less than 3979 even
 MSmits: taking a break while waiting for submit. I think I'll be trying some constants tomorrow in different submits. There must be one lucky combination in there somewhere
 YannT: constant tuning doesn't seem to have a lot of impact on this game
 MSmits: i ended at rank 2 below boss 3 times now
 MSmits: it doesnt need to have a lot of impact
 YannT: just wait to be pushed it shouldn't take long then&#160;;)
 MSmits: that works too
 MSmits: I'll be quite happy if I reach legend
 YannT: I'm not very worried for you&#160;;)
 MSmits: I am :P
 MSmits: just one more day basically
 MSmits: sunday wont have much time
 Nerchio: idk i submit and win some matches but i am at 47 all the time&#160;:(
 icecream17: 75th in silver =)
 Nerchio: nice
 Nerchio: gogo gold
 icecream17: The 'Ɑ' character messes the website up a little (copy paste it)
 struct: What do you mean mess?
 Zenoscave: 20% winrate on my last 20 matches
 Zenoscave: RIP
 rwilson:&#160;:(

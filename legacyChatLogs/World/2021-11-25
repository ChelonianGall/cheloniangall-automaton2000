 Husoski: NoahW Using eval() or exec() is fine if it works.  That's a cute way to use someone else's parser, I guess.  You have to define a lot of dn objects or convert dn to d(n) in the string.  I just wrote the parser. 
 Husoski: PS: There's no constraint listed for how big n can be in a dn die roll.  
 NoahW: I suppose, but you would almost never want to do that in production code
 NoahW: Actually, that gives me an idea for a fun game, are challenges based around breaking security allowed?
 Wontonimo: what kind of security?
 NoahW: just general code security
 Westicles: NoahW, like this?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5800a36c655f42f53885c128d09eaed15f7f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5800a36c655f42f53885c128d09eaed15f7f</a>
 NoahW: Westicles: I'm thinking more like the hackthissite.org challenges
 NoahW: maybe have it as part of a bank heist game where you have to avoid tripping the alarms
 Westicles: Ah, I see.  The in/out puzzles probably wouldn't work for that
 NoahW: oh no, the codingame sdk is Java
 Wontonimo: oh no?
 Wontonimo: surely whatever you code in is more complicated than Java, making Java a walk inthe park for you
 NoahW: I can't with java
 Wontonimo: surely whatever you can do in another language you can do in java.  math is math, logic is logic, and it's the same bytes in the background
 Wontonimo: but seriously though, that's too bad.  what is your language of choice NoahW&#160;?
 NoahW: Depends. I prefer Python, but if I'm doing anything graphics-wise I'll go with C#, if I'm writing firmware I'll use C &amp; x86. For web development I'll use Flask or nodejs, it really varies.
 Wontonimo: that's a healthy diversity
 Wontonimo: C# stole from Java, so it would be pretty easy to learn (or at least hack)

 Merfi: on*
 C26_1: @all
 C26_1: Are there anyone who are master of SQL
 C26_1: HackerRank just make everything harder by 100 times
 C26_1: I'm so frustrated to find a exercise that's not so hard, but not easy
 C26_1: @struct
 C26_1: Any tips for SQL
 Uljahn: just create exercises yourself, i.e. try to solve some easy puzzles using SQL
 C26_1: ok
 DevOops: Hey, quick question: Is there a way to copy/paste from another application to the editor window?  I don't seem to be able to make pasting work in the editor.
 DevOops: Alternatively, is there a way to upload code without the editor?
 DevOops: This is for the Ultimate TicTacToe competition, but I guess the question is relevant to all competitions.
 abt8601: I heard there's CodinGame Sync for the second question
 Uljahn: try ctrl+v to paste in IDE
 OopsDev: Doesn't work.  I am using notepad to copy from in this case.
 OopsDev: Actually I'm running a virtual Linux machine to do my development on, and thought that that may be the problem, but I managed to copy from the VM to notepad without problems.
 Uljahn: can you paste to notepad?
 OopsDev: Yes
 OopsDev: I also cannot use ctrl+a to select all in the CodinGame editor.
 Uljahn: can you paste to notepad in VM?
 OopsDev: I'm copying from kwrite in the VM to notepad in Windows (the host) without issues.
 Uljahn: and in the opposite direction?
 OopsDev: Works too
 DevOops: Re CodinGame Sync, that seems to be a Chrome extension.  I'm using Brave, and sometimes Firefox.  Would that work too?
 DevOops: Or is there a variation of CodinGame Sync for other browsers?
 Uljahn: i don't think Brave is fully supported by CG like Chrome and FF
 DevOops: Well, it should be standard JavaScript, right?
 Uljahn: should? IDE is a third-party Monaco Editor
 OopsDev: Firefox actually worked well.
 OopsDev: But now it says "code is too big".  :)
 OopsDev: I thought the limit was 1 MB or something like that.
 Uljahn: there is 100k limit
 Uljahn: it's not very large because submit history is kind of unlimited
 OopsDev: Yeah...  I just ported an old bot that I had made for theaigames.com and that's around 9000 lines in total.  The filesize when I concatenate all the files is 8900 lines.
 OopsDev: er, filesize is 275k, I mean.
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: codegolf time!
 Automaton2000: there are a lot of things
 OopsDev: Anyway, Uljahn: Thanks for the help.
 Uljahn: yw
 OopsDev: tx
 heptux: Ä± can't, tired :worried:
 eulerscheZahl: DevOops there is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359</a> as an alternative
 DirkieDurky: Im currently following the algorithms path and im at the Puzzle of the Week one. What exactly do I have to do to get the achievement?
 DirkieDurky: Because Ive beaten the first boss and am 13th in the leaderboard. I thought I wouldve gotten it by now
 struct: you needed to get to the next league
 struct: but there is only 1 league
 struct: so its not possible this week 
 DirkieDurky: ...
 DirkieDurky: Well thats dissapointing
 AndreasNEO: lol. Took me like 3 weeks before I had a puzzle I could solve
 P0sandu: hi
 Wontonimo: yo P0sandu 
 abt8601: I'm curious, what're the criteria for choosing puzzles of the week?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Money.
 abt8601: o_O
 eulerscheZahl: staff chooses them from a sorted list
 eulerscheZahl: 20 solvers, not been potw before, high rating
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: 'staff' is a codename for a script btw
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud said he does it manually with some sorted list as help
 eulerscheZahl: "yes, I pick it from a sorted filtered list. I just manually check the puzzleand try not to have puzzles from the same CodinGamer twice in a row"
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/466965651135922208/790870117617106954">https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/466965651135922208/790870117617106954</a>
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: list generated by a script.
 eulerscheZahl: and human at the end of the line to approve the suggestion
 Westicles: so it is impossible to get the achievement this week?
 struct: yes
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Clicking on a button... Script do more than its part of the job.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: It should be in staff. [CG]Script
 Adam798: The next quest on the green track i to unlock 30 achievements, you can work on that 
 Adam798: ok never mind I see that you have already way much than that&#160;!!
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: " try not to have puzzles from the same CodinGamer twice in a row" Oh, that's right. JCC is pow only one in two time.
 eulerscheZahl: JCC?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Java_coffee_cup
 Westicles: ah, his crazy ascii puzzle didn't get approved

 OopsDev: eulerscheZahl: That's wonderful, thanks
 bobbobob: hey 
 Lauu: Haha nice I got a 97% on the certificate test 
 Wontonimo: which language?
 Lauu: Python 
 Wontonimo: congrats
 MASTER123: c++
 eulerscheZahl: even with your 96% CG still thinks that you are better than 99% of the programmers
 eulerscheZahl: that comparison is total nonsense, isn't it?
 Westicles: I think the test is secretly to see how much English they know.  The programming part is too easy to tell much
 Lauu: Exactly
 Lauu: Tbh, that is definitely the trickiest part for me as a non-native English speaking European
 [CG]Thibaud: we're currently reviewing the way we calculate this score
 [CG]Thibaud: it's a bit limited for the way certif tests are built

 eulerscheZahl: select your message, 1  2 is a single line
 struct:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i'm mildly impressed that you got the number of spaces right
 struct: I just joined a random chat to test it
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: you can also do it with extra spaces it doesnt seem to matter
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Doesn't work on my client though... 
 struct: the chat expansion blaise?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: expansion?
 struct: to make chat full screen or w/e it is
 5DN1L: 1 and 2 show on the same line for me, 2 just shows very far right
 eulerscheZahl: external client?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: This one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGChat">https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGChat</a> But yes, the width isn't the same
 eulerscheZahl: probably depends on your OS and browser how it renders
 eulerscheZahl: looks fine for me, Ubuntu+Chromium
 struct: not windows 11?
 struct: :p
 eulerscheZahl: would you think such bad of me?&#160;:(
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :thinking:

 UZUHAMA: oh hi wonton
 Wontonimo: hey uzu
 UZUHAMA: I was just finishing my tic tac toe
 UZUHAMA: only need to check / diagonol now
 Thorcode: It is so ez to be top 1 in codegolf in my country
 Wontonimo: nice
 Thorcode: only more than 400cp

 Thorcode: I'm trying that too
 Thorcode: that is tough
 UZUHAMA: I'm trying to wrap this project up, but the last one just won't work...
 UZUHAMA: What you mean my code is "not optimized enough"???
 UZUHAMA: I tried my best you fkxjciov
 UZUHAMA: Does this mean an infinite loop or something...
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: I think that
 Wontonimo: yeah, probably an infinite loop most likely.
 UZUHAMA:  I thought so
 NoahW: my life is an infinite loop
 UZUHAMA: No escape
 UZUHAMA: Finally 100%...
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: congrats
 Wontonimo: now use that code beat the first boss in ultimate tic tac toe
 UZUHAMA: It's a total mess :expressionless:
 UZUHAMA: sad
 Wontonimo: make a random move unless you can detect that the move will will
 Wontonimo: if there is no winning move, check if the opponent can win and block
 Wontonimo: otherwise radom
 Wontonimo: that will beat the boss
 UZUHAMA: So I'm making some kind of an AI
 Wontonimo: you already did
 Wontonimo: now just put it in a loop
 Wontonimo: to test every move
 UZUHAMA: I'll try my best
 UZUHAMA: Wait
 UZUHAMA: There's a time limit???
 UZUHAMA: Response time &lt;= 1000ms
 UZUHAMA: What the heck...
 Wontonimo: for the first move then 100ms for each move after that
 UZUHAMA: Oh no...

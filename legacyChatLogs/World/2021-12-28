 ChickenCoder123: Bertinator what u wanna do
 Bertinator: i want to make a game of some sort
 n0b1e: good luck brothers!
 Bertinator: i want to work on a really fleshed out version of space invaders that also has 2 player
 ChickenCoder123: what is space invaders
 Bertinator: its a 2d game where you control a ship that can only move side to side, and you have to shoot a bunch of aliens that will slowly move towards you and shoot
 ChickenCoder123: i see
 ChickenCoder123: so why dont you try learn a language like unity and start making the game?
 Bertinator: i want to make from scratch
 Bertinator: using python and pygame
 Bertinator: because i dont have a good computer so unity is really slow 
 ChickenCoder123: i see
 ChickenCoder123: i actually have used pygame before
 ChickenCoder123: do you know how to use pygame?
 Bertinator: yeh
 n0b1e: very good for beginners 
 Bertinator: i made a simple moving square
 Bertinator: so i do know the BASIC stuff
 ChickenCoder123: well then what i did is i downloaded this thing called IDLE, which is just a simple code editor, and used that to try and build a game
 ChickenCoder123: i can also recommend some good resources to learn pygame
 Bertinator: yes please
 ChickenCoder123: this is the first thing i used to learn pygame: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/">https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/</a>
 ChickenCoder123: it actually teaches to make a game similar to space invaders but you just have to dodge enemies instead of shooting them
 ChickenCoder123: so its definitely a good start
 Bertinator: alr, thanks a lot

 ninjadip: of course, an understanding is very universal
 jacek: power of thor, the descent, temperatures are beginner friendly

 JulienBrouille: thank!
 ninjadip: how d u pull up old code on these things

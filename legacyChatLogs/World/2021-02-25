 jthemphill: tutubalin use a different font? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 jthemphill: tutubalin it's quite pretty though. It's JS, right?
 tutubalin: yeah
 tutubalin: it's 17x9 now. i can easily make it 18x9, but would be nice to find 16x8 solution
 JayM9: yo can someone help me
 JayM9: real quick
 JayM9: its saying im not doing this right
 jthemphill: JayM9 what's up?
 jthemphill: tutubalin Yeah I definitely don't know as much about ES2020 as you do, certainly not enough to shave 25 more chars off this :sweat_smile:
 RAWAN_REDDY: i have a feeling coc has bots
 RAWAN_REDDY: is it possible
 RAWAN_REDDY:&#160;?
 tutubalin: RAWAN_REDDY there are plenty of bots
 tutubalin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a>
 JayM9: dang how do you compare characters in a string
 JayM9: to say if it is&#160;!= to a " "
 RAWAN_REDDY: okay this is sad
 JayM9: im new
 RAWAN_REDDY: now that i know its bots 
 JayM9: sorry
 tutubalin: RAWAN_REDDY all level 7 with 50k+ clashes are bots
 tutubalin: JayM9 which language?
 JayM9: okay wtf
 JayM9: java
 JayM9: so its saying
 JayM9: 1 
 JayM9: 30 
 JayM9: = 9
 JayM9: and 
 JayM9: 1
 tutubalin: i don't understand what are you talking about
 JayM9: i have a COC that wantes me to make code off the question
 JayM9: But, I have no diea what it soding
 Kai-Hiwatari: hii
 tutubalin: is it reverse challenge?
 JayM9: wait so what is in.nextInt mean
 tutubalin: it means "read next chunk as integer"
 JayM9: what is N
 JayM9: like it says that N = in.next();
 Kai-Hiwatari: in what JayM9
 JayM9: then it says that for ( loop through I &lt; n). Then it says int A = in.nextInt
 JayM9: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8c5520a1-488c-4d64-a3e5-77294a099805">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8c5520a1-488c-4d64-a3e5-77294a099805</a>
 JayM9: like i dont understand waht is the loop 
 JayM9: and how does it work here
 tutubalin: N is number of lines to read
 tutubalin: every line contains 2 integers
 JayM9: what is it reading it for?
 JayM9: I see
 JayM9: but where does it say 
 JayM9: whats the ppint of the loop
 tutubalin: the point of the loop is too read N lines of input
 JayM9: so where does it say that we have N lines of 2 integer code
 tutubalin: in problem statement?
 Dom9543: is this game free or do i have to later pay for it

 Uljahn: :confused:
 Uljahn: the recommender system failed due to the cold start problem
 Dom9543: Coding is hard
 MSmits: mmh my cpu temperature i 99 C
 MSmits: and not running much
 MSmits: any chance this is a faulty sensor?
 MSmits: in fact it is that temperature immediately after turning on...
 darkhorse64: not enough for fried eggs, start a mata mcts and have a breakfast
 MSmits: it shouldnt be possible to be that hot right after turning on, just from running windows should it?
 Dom9543: fry some chyky nugys
 darkhorse64: I'll see if I can get this information on my PC
 MSmits: i think normal idle temperatures are 50 C or something
 MSmits: or lower even
 ProCoder3: in Compete events like mean and other stuff is it possible to restart the progress 
 ProCoder3: *mean max
 Uljahn: no, there is no way to lower leagues after promotion besides making new account
 darkhorse64: My CPU is at 50°. Fan is dead&#160;?
 Uljahn: probably
 ProCoder3: @Uljahn Thanks 
 the_tiger: hello
 Dom9543: how do i separate the output in the same script in C#&#160;?
 Dom9543: pls help me
 KiwiTae: Dom9543 separate the output? 
 KiwiTae: Console.WriteLine
 AntiSquid: split strings&#160;?
 Dom9543: yes
 AntiSquid: google c# split strings
 KiwiTae: YourString.Split(' ')
 Dom9543: when i try, Console.WriteLine() it comes to the same output
 Dom9543: so i can only do 1 task
 Dom9543: why is it so frustrating
 Dom9543: i dont know what will work
 BlaiseEbuth: And we don't know what you are talking about. What are you trying to do and in which context&#160;?

 Wontonimo: MSmits my son's pc was having heat problems just a week ago.  OPened it up and it was clogged with dust.  When's the last clearning your gave your pc?
 Wontonimo: His went from a roaring fan and unit heater 24/7 to a whisper and cool
 darkhorse64: ^
 Aiger-Akabane: hii
 Uljahn: saying 'hii' is a bannable offence :smirk:
 Aiger-Akabane: okk UIjahn
 Passifi: Приветт 
 Passifi: just checking whether this is true for all languages :P
 Uljahn: still there is a chance if you start using it frequently to abuse the chat
 struct: MSmits should not be at 99ºC after turning on
 struct: My idle temperatures for cpu are under 30ºC
 AntiSquid: fan issues?
 struct: maybe
 struct: His fans probably spin more in 1 day than mine spin in 1 week :D
 Uljahn: in case of a heat-pipes cooler could be a coolant leak
 AntiSquid: got to bit board that and check it quicker
 Kitkat260: gm
 Kitkat260: anyone awake
 Kitkat260:&#160;?
 MSmits: I just ordered a new pc.. I dunno whats wrong, i think the sensor is not good, but i dont trust it and the computer was 5 yrs old so...
 MSmits: intel i9 with 32 gb ram, no GPU (still have a reasonable one)
 Kitkat260: haha
 MSmits: i5 with 8 gb -&gt; i9 with 32 gb. Nice upgrade&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: more threads, more books
 MSmits: I think it's 10 or 12 core, not sure
 MSmits: i currently have 4
 MSmits: 10 it seems
 MSmits: more than enough
 darkhorse64: I don't know if all i9 are hexacore
 MSmits: my GPU is 1060 GTX. Seemed a waste to replace that if i never use it
 MSmits: can always do it later
 Kitkat260: i'm confused
 MSmits: a budget pick right now is the 1660 super, but it's only a little better
 MSmits: my wife also complained about the noise a lot, so i picked the most quiet cooler i could find
 MSmits: somehow me countering with, but... the book, didnt convince her to allow me to keep it turned on
 AntiSquid: if you're unable to follow a conversation you should stay out of it&#160;:/
 Kitkat260: ok
 Qspi: ü
 struct: which cpu are you getting MSmits?
 TBali: "my wife also complained about the noise a lot,"LOL, the main reason I abandoned years ago having a desktop PC at home was the noise. I moved to laptops with SSD. But now my laptop is too noisy as well. 
 TBali: It is a shame that consumer products cannot solve this issue reasonably without tweaking
 struct: There are some pretty good fans
 TBali: water cooling laptops?
 struct: ah, mine is desktop
 TBali: desktop pc at the basement and long cable for monitor/keymourd/mouse/USB slot
 TBali: *keyboard
 TBali: Probably others already invented this
 TBali: Or maybe there would be marked for special kitchen fridges, with a special slot for PC-s
 TBali: *market

 TBali: *could
 Wontonimo: @Toby75 you responded to codybumba with a really good example showing a longest streak.  I'd suggest copying that into the description as-is.  It's worth 100's of words
 Toby75: Alright, I will do that - I hope it does not make the description too long...
 Wontonimo:&#160;:( yeah, there is that
 darkhorse64: Make a puzzle from it
 Toby75: I will create a puzzle for it rn! Thanks for your suggestions
 darkhorse64: You can even design a second part: ipv6 expander

 Toby75: Haha yeah
 Toby75: what tags can I use?
 Toby75: do you have suggestions?
 darkhorse64: parsing, regex, string manipulation if they exist
 jacek: 5%, disappointment
 darkhorse64: valid only for multis

 Wontonimo: Please .... please please , can me agree that the default output be hardcoded to pass the first unit test so that testing all languages works really easily
 Wontonimo: seeing a green pass is way faster and easier to verify than looking at the failure message
 MSmits: struct I9 10700
 struct: 10900?
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: 10900 yes
 MSmits: the 10700 was an ì7
 MSmits: i'm skipping 7
 MSmits: I still think it's weird my cpu is at near 100 C on boot. That seems physically impossible
 struct: you are buying prebuilt pc?
 MSmits: I think it's the sensor
 MSmits: not exactly
 MSmits: i selected stuff
 struct: 100º is very strange
 MSmits: it's built in, i only add 2 HD's from my old computer and my old GPU
 struct: I probably could stop my fans at idle and it would not reach close to 100ç
 MSmits: so not much work for me
 MSmits: no, i think it's the cpu
 MSmits: err sensor
 MSmits: there may be nothing wrong with the thing
 MSmits: probably thermal paste needs replacing so the cooler would have to work less hard, but i doubt it ever reaches 100 C
 AntiSquid: need at least 90 C to kill bacteria, might be a covid upgrade for BIOS
 MSmits: 100 C to be safe, might be the British variant
 AntiSquid: heard we might get 3rd strain lol
 MSmits: there's thousands of strains
 AntiSquid: everyone else is lagging behind still at version 1.0.0
 MSmits: most are just not significantly different
 AntiSquid: have you considered merely replacing motherboard&#160;?#
 MSmits: I kinda want a new cpu, 4 cores i5 is limiting
 Jstn123: hello
 MSmits: i hardly ever use gpu for anything besides normal use. No gamign and stuff, so my use of the PC is very cpu centric
 AntiSquid: you might need new motherboard anyway for it&#160;?!  what do you use cpu for&#160;?
 MSmits: i get a new mb, i get everything new except pherpipherals (sp), gpu and HD
 Kitkat260: hello
 Jstn123: hi antisquid
 MSmits: i use CPU to run meta mcts
 MSmits: and other kidns of benchmarking
 struct: is it the normal 10900?
 struct: or k or kf?
 MSmits: the one without onboard graphics
 Kitkat260:&#160;?
 MSmits: onchip
 MSmits: the cheaper one
 MSmits: because I have the gpu
 AntiSquid: why the intel cpu&#160;?
 struct: I think they all have onboard graphics
 reCurse: No
 struct: ah the kf doesnt
 MSmits: AntiSquid mostly right now because I've had intel for a few years and saw no major reason to change. Amd uses more cores no?
 MSmits: thats the one I got
 MSmits: yeah seems intel has slightly more clock speed and amd more cores... in general
 MSmits: I really dont need more than the 10 cores I get with i9. Not looking to run many parallel threads within a single program or run too many at once
 AntiSquid: and were you able to find the parts you were looking for or did you just pick what's available?
 reCurse: I would have waited for 11th gen if I were you
 Wontonimo: _sigh_ I'd love to have 12 cores or more with a decent nvidia card, but just can't justify it
 reCurse: It's coming out next month
 MSmits: too expensive
 MSmits: i generally dont get top of the line stuff that costs twice as much
 reCurse: Official pricing is not available yet though?
 MSmits: thats just the way it always seems to be with new stuff
 reCurse: They can't afford to, they need to compete with amd
 AntiSquid: remember what happened to ryzen 3k series after release?
 struct: leaked prices where not bad
 MSmits: also i'm afraid my computer wont last another month 
 Passifi: Has the market on computer stuff started too cool down again&#160;? I thought right now no one should buy unless they have too
 MSmits: dont want to run into the situation where it breaks down
 reCurse: If you don't look for the hottest and greatest there's plenty
 MSmits: as i said, i dont know if the 100 degrees cpu temperature is a sensor glitch or not :P
 struct: is it always running at 100º=
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: Sounds like a glitch
 MSmits: no matter what i do
 MSmits: I think so too reCurse
 reCurse: Do you hear fan spinning like crazy
 MSmits: they always make qutie a lot of noise yes
 MSmits: but even that can mean its a glitch
 MSmits: if the sensor tells the fan to work
 reCurse: Well if it uses sensor for fan speed yeah I guess not reliable
 MSmits:  i used to replace my computer every 3-4 yrs and graphics card every  2 years
 MSmits: i've had the current stuff for much longer than that
 reCurse: Computer shouldn't fail that early
 MSmits: no, i wanted faster stuff
 MSmits: i was a gamer then
 reCurse: "also i'm afraid my computer wont last another month"
 MSmits: that too
 MSmits: i am just not sure what is wrong with it&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm hitting the reset button and getting i9 :0
 MSmits: easier than worrying about it
 MSmits: it's not that expensive, 1100 Euros total. Not bad if it lasts another 5 years
 struct: 1100€ without graphics card?
 MSmits: yes, but with 32 gb ram as well, fastest type
 MSmits: and a good mb
 MSmits: and casing
 struct: What is the cpu price there?
 AntiSquid: 32gb isn't that much anymore#
 reCurse: Chances are you're not even running memory at the speed it advertises
 MSmits: i had 8b :P
 MSmits: have
 reCurse: Unless you tweaked OC settings in bios?
 MSmits: probably not
 reCurse: Didn't think so
 reCurse: So it's probably running at 2133
 MSmits: dont remember what i did in bios 3 yrs ago
 MSmits: or 5 yrs, i dunno, i dont look in the bios too often
 MSmits: its ugly
 jacek: no more books for you then
 jacek: or from you
 MSmits: how so
 MSmits: i'll have the new computer in 3-6 days apparently
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: dont worry, i dont counterbook anymore. I
 reCurse: They got him
 MSmits: Its unsatisfying
 MSmits: I just run general books and investigate games with meta mcts
 jacek: thats the spirit
 MSmits: that's not to say it wont make my bots better than they are without it. But i won't suddenly beat your bot 100% out of the blue
 reCurse: I've been wondering if including games played against live bots in training would count as counterbooking
 MSmits: hmm, it's not that dissimilar. but it has the same problems
 MSmits: low variety
 Westicles: But the caterwauling about the counterbooking was so fun to read...
 MSmits: and people change 1 param
 MSmits: and it fails
 MSmits: lol Westicles
 reCurse: Well it's not hardcoding moves, just biasing the training a bit towards those moves
 reCurse: A bit like transfer learning
 MSmits: it is similar to the paralllel between generating an opening book and training a nn to play from a fixed opening
 MSmits: an opening book is useless when you change the start of the game
 MSmits: a NN that trained on fixed start may lose effectiveness if you change the start also
 MSmits: though that may not be true, hard to say
 reCurse: I'm not saying fixed start though
 MSmits: no i know, but training on opponent games is a sort of fixed thing
 reCurse: Let's say I take my current generic model
 MSmits: considering most opponents are pretty deterministic
 reCurse: And I use it as the base for including moves it has not seen or lost games
 reCurse: So transfer learning
 reCurse: Is that in the same vein as counterbooking or not
 MSmits: that depends on how general the knowledge becomes
 reCurse: It is not the same as training only on that data at all
 MSmits: if it only becomes strong against those particular versions of opponents, then its similar to counterbooking
 jacek: its not counterbooking imo
 reCurse: So overfitting a bot's param is counterbooking too?
 MSmits: yeah it is, in a way
 MSmits: it's just fewer parameters
 MSmits: i did it in oware
 MSmits: seemed a lot like counterbooking to me
 reCurse: I'm starting to think your definition is way too broad
 MSmits: well maybe it shouldnt be a definition, but a degree of overfitting
 MSmits: counterbooking being an extreme form of that
 jacek: you train ONLY on those positions, then maybe. but if you artificially add those positions to your general training, its alright
 MSmits: jacek well.... when i counterbook it's also just addition
 MSmits: i dont replace anything
 MSmits: it only gets more knowledge
 MSmits: I generally grow an opening book and i just fix some deep branches too it that belong to players
 MSmits: i stopped doing that last bit
 Scarfield: reCurse who is the boss in wood 2 for your chess multi, and do you know how it works? (minmax depth 2)
 MSmits: why would he not know how his own boss works?
 Scarfield: could be someone elses bot thought
 MSmits: did someone else write it?
 MSmits: ah
 reCurse: minimax depth 2, strict material evaluation
 reCurse: random on moves of equal score
 Scarfield: okay ty&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's very noticable when players forget to do that 2nd part&#160;:)
 reCurse: I think biasing exploration with distribution of games seen on arena has nothing to do with counterbooking since the hardcoding part is what breaks the most to me.
 reCurse: Same with fitting params since you have no indication it's 
 reCurse: So there are two concepts at play
 MSmits: i do have indication
 MSmits: I always fit to 5 players or so with cg bench
 MSmits: if i see the winrate drop from 70% to 20% when i change a param from 2,0 to 2,05
 MSmits: thats what it was like in oware
 MSmits: wr vs you would drop like that and robo would go up the same amount
 MSmits: trick was juggling the 8 params in such away they all stayed high
 MSmits: i doubt it objectively became stronger or weaker as a bot because of those param chamges
 reCurse: Still feels pretty wrong to bunch that with hardcoding moves
 reCurse: That only a specific opponent plays
 reCurse: They don't seem to be in the same ballpark at all
 MSmits: yeah its not the same
 MSmits: it has similarities though
 MSmits: I mean you can get nr 1 this way, or at least rank much higher, but it's an illusionary rank in that the bot is maybe not really that strong
 MSmits: because you fit to the current opponent
 MSmits: it doesnt last when they submit new versions
 MSmits: neither does counterbooking
 Wontonimo: this is reminding me of the time the school board thought it was a great idea to "talk" to the 8th graders about not doing whippets, only to find that noone knew before but the next week nearly the whole grade was doing it.  Talk of overfitting book attacks ... oh, the temptation...
 MSmits: your idea to use opponent games in training may also share this, or maybe to a weak degree. As I said, i don't know how well the method generalizes
 MSmits: doing whippets?
 MSmits: what kind of school was this? a whippet is a dog
 Wontonimo: breathing the gas from whip cream cans to get high
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: so you mean because we talk about it, it gives you ideas?
 Wontonimo: an i human?
 MSmits: there are some caveats though. To properly generate books offline, your bot needs to be pretty good
 Wontonimo: yeah, but that's just not my style.  I'd rather lose 
 MSmits: doesnt have to be the best
 MSmits: but good
 Scarfield: does the pope make jobby in the woods.. wait thats not how it goes
 MSmits: :poop:
 Wontonimo: :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: Wontonimo I never got into this book thing because I wanted to strictly counter players. I just liked exploring games with meta mcts. But I quickly learned it was a very small addition to select which nodes to explore 
 MSmits: (the nodes picked by opponents)
 Wontonimo: i believe you, and i never thought otherwise MSmits
 jacek: :thinking:
 MSmits: I think i started using meta mcts with yavalath didnt i
 MSmits: when you did jacek
 MSmits: and i started counterbooking when i made one for uttt, and also started doing it in yavalath then
 reCurse: At the risk of repeating myself it's a very roundabout way to do counterbooking
 MSmits: I know, but thats because I dont just want to counter the opponent
 MSmits: i want the replies to be generally good
 MSmits: i also dont run a mcts just with more calc time
 MSmits:  a rollout is a whole game
 MSmits: 1 visit takes 2-3 seconds
 MSmits: so it may not be the fastest way to do a counterbook, but its more future-proof, incase the opponent does submit new versions
 MSmits: at least i didnt give my bot crap moves
 MSmits: it's probably more of a mix between general opening and counter. I just nudge it in the right direction :0
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f7053a49-0609-425d-bc7c-72bdfe568429">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f7053a49-0609-425d-bc7c-72bdfe568429</a>
 MSmits: I agree Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: oh crap ... i monologued  and got pastebinned&#160;!
 MSmits: i read it, its fine
 MSmits: it's just hard when you find a tool that is reasonably fun to use and easily gets you rank 1 or near enough and then to stop using it
 reCurse: Counterbooking kills competition in a way nothing else does though
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats the main reason i stopped
 Wontonimo: an "easy" solution (that would kill a lot of the visual fun) would be to not show the games but only the results.  
 MSmits: that would suck
 MSmits: we need to see what our bots do
 struct: also it stops your progress
 jacek: blind chess?
 reCurse: Not just visual fun but might as well optimize a black box
 MSmits: even in blind chess, you see
 MSmits: it's just in your head
 MSmits: well not when i do it, i just do a lot of illegal moves
 Wontonimo: okay, it would suck ... but let's go with this a bit, what if you are throttled with how many opponent plays you get to see a day?  See all the league bot playouts you want, but only a few of other players per day
 MSmits: Wontonimo i needed very few games to counterbook some players
 MSmits: I literally just ran maybe 10 games to find the first loss, then watch that game and mark the nodes to explore in my meta mcts
 Wontonimo: i'm not acutally suggesting suggesting this, it's just a thought experiment
 MSmits: most bots are so deterministic, this approach is enough
 Wontonimo: * note: must add random to counter MSmits *
 Wontonimo: jk
 MSmits: well you would have needed that before :P
 MSmits: but its a good idea in general
 MSmits: it makes your bots easier to test
 MSmits: as overfitting occurs less
 MSmits: just dont make it too random
 MSmits: or it gets weaker
 jacek: eeyup
 Wontonimo: random()*9001
 MSmits: well say you're using mcts in uttt
 MSmits: and you have scores between 0 and 1
 MSmits: then adding a random 0,01 should be ok
 Wontonimo: yeah man, i get the idea dude
 MSmits: kk&#160;:)
 jacek: well if you do random rollouts, you dont need additional random
 MSmits: you'd think so
 Wontonimo: the over 9000 i see was too much eh
 MSmits: but people use FastRandom(seed)
 MSmits: so it's entirely deterministic, except for calc time
 jacek: then just use different seed
 MSmits: you should indeed
 struct: Now you will be able to run 10 metas at once
 Wontonimo: the meta of messing with book attacks ... make your random seed from the date (no time) so during one day it looks deterministic, fooling people into spending a lot of time into countering your fake determinism ....

 HunterEhrenfeld: it confuses me lol
 -oa-: so much trigonometry
 Wontonimo: really?  a little cosine never hurt anyone
 Wontonimo: i haven't been in the wood league for so long i forget what data you get.  What's the data and output?
 HunterEhrenfeld: its pretty easy lol the only real input is nextCheckpoint and the angle 
 darkhorse64: In all leagues, you have got enough information to apply the -3vel heuristic
 Wontonimo: have you looked in the discussion, there are hints there
 HunterEhrenfeld: i have not! didnt even know it was a thing lol
 Wontonimo: in the replay where you can watch your bot, there is a gear for settings.  Turn on the debug.  It's gold
 jacek: not legend?
 Wontonimo: who me?
 jacek: nevermind
 Wontonimo: oh ... the feature ... no, it didn't beat the boss
 struct: With smitsimax with 2 runners vs 2 runners you can get close to 100% win rate on submit
 Wontonimo: the boss didn't let it get promoted because it doesn't offer game replay data download
 Wontonimo: struct that *almost* got me to re-read the article just now ... but work calls
 struct: I think I got 100% but Im not sure
 Wontonimo: i haven't given CSB anywhere near the attention of uttt.  No simulation even.
 jacek: buck this chess. lets train it without castling
 Wontonimo: wow, the score spread at the top of chess is huge
 jacek: 7 ppl in league
 jacek: and i wasnt serious yet
 HunterEhrenfeld: im losing battles rn.... i should retire
 Wontonimo: if 4pts == 70% win rate ... the 8pt lead is what, 98% win rate
 Saad-py: hi
 Stark-program: what game is this
 Wontonimo: chess
 Saad-py: lol

 HunterEhrenfeld: am i the only one who hates code golf? lol
 Wontonimo: oh, i didn't know that the chess game was random
 jacek: yeah, making castling is quite complicated
 Astrobytes: it was initially 960 + CrazyHouse
 Wontonimo: what's crazyhouse?
 Wontonimo: lmgtfo ... i know i know
 Astrobytes: You can reintroduce captured pieces
 Astrobytes: In a Shogi-way
 Wontonimo: that's crazy
 jacek: crazyhouse has low draw rate, but about 80% 1p win
 Astrobytes: wonder what the rates are like combined with 960
 AntiSquid: should have done 2v2 crazy house :D
 Astrobytes: Isn't that bughouse or something?
 Wontonimo: Learning Opportunities&#160;: [Chess]lol
 AntiSquid: idk, too many variants ...
 Wontonimo: you will learn nothing-else&#160;! bwah hah ha
 jacek: :cheese:
 AntiSquid: ya there are better ways to spend your time
 Wontonimo: oh, "random" as a command in chess is a nice one to get the game up and going quickly
 Wontonimo: reCurse +1 for random in chess
 AntiSquid: i am sure it's there to get a bot ready quicker
 Wontonimo: for sure
 jacek: well its random chess. random option is a nice bonus
 Wontonimo: oh, 2 games in each arena battle.  nice.  i'll give that another +1
 abolfazlghalandary: hello
 Wontonimo: hi stranger
 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 bricefriha: Hi folks
 Notgoodatcoding5: How are you?
 bricefriha: Good, you? 😀
 Notgoodatcoding5: I'm good.
 jacek: good evening
 Notgoodatcoding5: What's your favorite movie?
 Wontonimo: arena battle tv
 Notgoodatcoding5: cool
 Wontonimo: i'm especially addicted to reruns
 jacek: huh
 Notgoodatcoding5: I've never heard of that movie.
 Wontonimo: it's more like a episode thing
 Wilster: bill and ted excellent adventure
 jacek: mlp: the movie
 Notgoodatcoding5: Mine is the Hunger games.
 Astrobytes: World Chat: The Cleansing
 Notgoodatcoding5: Does anyone like sports?
 Wontonimo: no
 jacek: Oo
 Wontonimo: tbh i used to play discgolf
 Notgoodatcoding5: Me and my dad play discgolf all the time.
 Astrobytes: Glorified frisbee?
 Astrobytes: Or is the disc more like a discus?
 Astrobytes: Either way I'm not keen on sports. I competed in discus, javelin and shot put as a young man and left it there.
 jacek: what about :soccer:
 Astrobytes: A little bit but just casually.
 Astrobytes: I still enjoy watching rugby.
 Notgoodatcoding5: I like basketball ,soccer, football and some others.
 Wontonimo: discgolf isn't about frisbee, it's about walking around, enjoying nature, and otherthings ... then stumbling around ... it's a degenerate sport
 Astrobytes: inb4 jacek and :notepad_spiral: :soccer:
 Astrobytes: I can get on board with that Wontonimo but that sounds like every time I've played frisbee :D
 Wontonimo: :smirk:
 Wontonimo: we'd get along well then
 AntiSquid: that can only be true if you're jacek's alt, who else likes that game?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jello, there are a couple of discgolf courses in FL complete with tree obstacles, etc.  its not bad ... mostly a bunch of stoners who can't afford regular golf :P
 Wontonimo: ^
 Wontonimo: zrdon I see you in uttt, you can't hide from me!
 AntiSquid: if you see MSmits show him this, he might still be interested in new fans:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/8UrSbqBOtMg?t=443">https://youtu.be/8UrSbqBOtMg?t=443</a>

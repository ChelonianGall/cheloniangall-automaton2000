 jacek: happy Caturday
 Lassassin: im pretty suck on death first search ep 1
 Lassassin: stuck*
 Lassassin: any tips?
 jacek: graph theory, BFS?
 Lassassin: im trying to implement bfs
 Lassassin: its very hard to debug and see whats going on

 Jogginho: Did someone know if the event green circle will be a bot programming match soon or not (sry for my english)
 jacek: it is now <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/green-circle">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/green-circle</a>
 jacek: but they are discussing if the bronze/silver/gold/legend leagues should be back

 j4at: yeah&#160;:(
 sqrtNOT: Awwww heck. I was trying to get the AI certification path "reach bronze league in 2 games" step so I tried dots and boxes. Only to realize there's not even a bronze league for dots and boxes after finishing my solution. OTL

 sqrtNOT: Is the goal to do as many donuts as possible? Because it's looking great!
 abt8601: Well, IIRC the actual goal is to finish some number of laps as soon as possible
 sqrtNOT: Oh... Yeah you should probably fix that then.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i used the CSB math, nothing fancy...loves donuts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just making jacek and j4at look good

 eulerscheZahl: i extracted the most frequently shared URLs from chat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903337608606789755/992722214229119047/urls.txt">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903337608606789755/992722214229119047/urls.txt</a>congrats jacek, you trolled into rank 13
 wlesavo: i thought TrueSkill will be quite higher
 eulerscheZahl: some like cgstats would be higher if i combine URLs with different ending but same domain
 jacek: :3
 eulerscheZahl: i also filtered some URLs like clash invites
 jacek: why dQw4w9WgXcQ appears 2 times
 eulerscheZahl: youtube.com, youtu.be
 eulerscheZahl: i don't trust the Belgian youtube
 j4at: Belgian youtube&#160;?
 j4at: youtu.be is shortlink
 j4at: you should combine both of them
 eulerscheZahl: .be is the TDL for belgium, isn't it?
 j4at: well, yes
 j4at: but there is also youtube.be
 eulerscheZahl: and myip.is is from iceland
 eulerscheZahl: and .tv is tuvalu
 jacek: temporal difference learning for belgium?
 MSmits: aw sht i try to submit my green circle code and it cant pass wood
 jacek: try 1st action
 MSmits: err i will still have to modify my code a lot for this. I ignored those
 MSmits: a bit lame they didnt just copy the leaderboard
 jacek: its still discussed
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: ah I see, it's the app problem. 
 MSmits: 3 skills per app
 MSmits: sim can't process that

 kovi: greencircle was worse...animating final location difference
 kovi: MSmits first action works
 zaues: so does anybody know what the right code is 
 jacek: 42069
 zaues: 42069 meaning????
 eulerscheZahl: jacek your tank is speeding and should get a ticket
 zaues: so can anybody help me with this 
 jacek: with what
 zaues: has anyone done the descent coding ome&#160;??
 zaues: one^***
 jacek: you have HINTS on the left
 jacek: even with full code if needed
 _Royale: eulerscheZahl: nobody shared my tool? :cry:
 jacek: the what?
 eulerscheZahl: or they shared with user ID in the URL. i don't merge those
 zaues: thats really fucking crazy ive been sitting infront of my desk for 3 hours looking dumb asf \
 jacek: do you have any programming experience?
 eulerscheZahl: let me check again without filtering (only showing a URL with &gt; 1 occurence)
 zaues: not really ive im being homest 
 zaues: i guess you could say a little i know some of java but thats it 
 eulerscheZahl: 6 hits for "rezonux"
 zaues: been up since 11 trying to teach my self 
 eulerscheZahl: but i linked you in the top bar of my puzzle search, a one-sided favor&#160;;)
 zaues: who me&#160;??
 _Royale: eulerscheZahl: oops let me fix that&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: &lt;3
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair, i added that top bar last. cgstats, chadok et al. already linked each other at that point
 zaues: such kind people 
 jacek: :blush:
 MSmits: trying first action now
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: 2-6 so far in submit&#160;:(
 MSmits: oh doin better now
 jacek: so random
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: ranked above boss now. I guess unlucky start
 eulerscheZahl: i read your code a bit more. i think my main advantage over you are the hardcoded opening moves
 jacek: euler overbooked the booker
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i tried booking moves
 MSmits: but it wasn't better for me
 Geniu_us: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: I guess maybe what happened is that my eval takes care of the opening 
 MSmits: but it's less good for later on
 MSmits: and since you split the effort, you can have an eval that isbetter for late game
 MSmits: and still have a good opening
 MSmits: so what i may have done is hardcode the opening, then refit the parameters
 MSmits: maybe should have done
 MSmits: I was kinda sick of fitting params though and i wasted a lot of time trying to build a new bot
 MSmits: first action submit failed. 0.63 below boss :P
 MSmits: trying again
 MSmits: btw eulerscheZahl if you have any general pointers/advice after reading the code, that would be cool
 MSmits: (not necessarily relating to green circle)
 jacek: i should have learn how to read unicode in D, at least id be first in language
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: who cares about that anyways, what you did was far more impressive than some language achiev
 Astrobytes: ^ this all day
 jacek: did you know england won world cup in 1966
 MSmits: i did not know this random fact
 Astrobytes: well, during the contest I said jacek would keep talking about getting legend and being the gold boss in the same way as the English speak of their last world cup win in '66
 Astrobytes: ie. all the damn time
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 MSmits: ohh ok got it
 MSmits: this was probably when I was flying in a little plane, looking down on the common people.
 Astrobytes: but I prefer jacek over most English football fans tbh
 MSmits: that's like saying you prefer sprouts over shit
 MSmits: :P
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: yay i promoted
 MSmits: hope it works again, there's another wood
 jacek: wood2 has final rules i think
 MSmits: ah ok, i am in wood 3, so need to be lucky again
 MSmits: I am wrecking them now
 MSmits: daninja goin down
 eulerscheZahl: btw eulerscheZahl if you have any general pointers/advice after reading the code, that would be cool
 eulerscheZahl: that global variables :scream:
 MSmits: oh, right, i still do that. Not as much as I used to though
 jacek: whats wrong with them
 StevenV: :sneezing_face:
 MSmits: they can cause bugs
 MSmits: hard to find ones
 eulerscheZahl: you miss the Fortran days, don't you jacek?
 jacek: :older_man:
 MSmits: sometimes in a function you use the same variable name as a global variable or near enough. Then when you type it wrong, there is no error, because you typed the global one instead of the local one
 MSmits: really hard to figure out what the problem is in that case
 Astrobytes: prefix it with a g or something
 j4at: Fortran what is that&#160;? ah, CG should add machine code. I don't know any of this fancy languages
 Astrobytes: If you must use them
 MSmits: that's good advice
 StevenV: In java, global variable should be ALL_UPPERCASE
 eulerscheZahl: i hate both global variables and hungarian notation. so sure: let's combine them, minus times minus is plus
 Astrobytes: yeah you could use that convention too
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Aldoggen: I've heard constants should be upper case in java
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that for constants, StevenV?
 MSmits: i do this for constants yea
 eulerscheZahl: in java everything is public by default (well, package private)
 StevenV: yup, it is for constant, and most of the case static var are final
 jacek: most of the case -_
 Aldoggen: lol I've done some ugly things
 MSmits: StevenV the global vars we are talking about are not constant
 StevenV: :D
 jacek: i saw code based on global public statics ~
 StevenV: but we could use the same
 MSmits: yay another promotion. wood 4 was harder than wood 3
 MSmits: a lot harder
 jacek: hard wood eh
 MSmits: indeed
 Aldoggen: they get more predictable maybe
 Astrobytes: that, she , said
 StevenV: yesterday when I was in wood3, only the boss and me are there
 MSmits: There's a Japanese turd in wood 2. I know this sounds racist but it's literally true
 MSmits: he has a profile pic of  a jobby
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: LOL I see it
 Astrobytes: nrvf t
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Mildly disturbing pic
 jacek: is this javascript?
 MSmits: it's a c++ turd
 MSmits: mmh Nerchio must have submitted 1st action and then logged off
 MSmits: he's in wood 2
 Nerchio: no i submitted my normal bot
 Nerchio: too lazy to tweak it to pass to wood1
 MSmits: huh, why is it in wood 2?
 MSmits: yeah, but why does it need tweak?
 MSmits: it's full rules
 MSmits: if you submit your contest code, you should be in wood 1
 Westicles: the guilt was too much, one of the kiss the girl 1-stars upgraded to 2-stars
 Nerchio: i dont think its full rules
 MSmits: seems to be to be, i have 0 losses with my contest code
 MSmits: to me to be
 Nerchio: you cant use some skills i think
 MSmits: it doesnt talk about future rules
 MSmits: wood 3 and 4 do
 Nerchio: i see now i think i submitted default
 StevenV: wood2 is full rule
 StevenV:&#160;:)
 MSmits: see now, first loss
 MSmits: to Nerchio contest bot
 MSmits: let's wreck that turd together Nerchio
 Nerchio: :joy:
 Aldoggen: what puzzle are you guys talking about?
 Nerchio: i was kinda waiting for them to put normal leagues in
 MSmits: green-circle, it's a multiplayer arena
 Aldoggen: aight thanks
 MSmits: Nerchio if they do that, they'll just copy the contest result i think, you dont need to do anything for that
 Astrobytes: they won't copy the bots
 Astrobytes: said so on discord
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: oh
 StevenV: there is no legend, I have no motivate to improve my bot&#160;:(
 MSmits: they did so before on previous contests
 Astrobytes: we *might* get leagues
 Astrobytes: and *might* get mirror matches
 Astrobytes: but no copying of bots
 MSmits: I am used to do doing community contribs... all wood anyways
 Astrobytes: Since this is a hybrid sponsored/community contest there are contractual issues
 eulerscheZahl: bots are the most important part IMO
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I mean... they're populating the leaderboards so...
 Astrobytes: as it is currently, I am not motivated to improve my bot in the slightest
 jacek: Automaton2000 you are important
 Automaton2000: i find the most shocking is that juju is 2nd with python
 Westicles: I wonder if SG paid anything to run it?   Kind of impressive to trick them into running a contest and make them pay
 jacek: its advertisement isnt it
 struct: hi
 Westicles: hmm, well maybe now that it is a US company big tobacco can run the next one
 struct: whats the max number possible on 2048 validators?
 struct: is it possible to go over 65536?
 Westicles: yes
 eulerscheZahl: millions
 eulerscheZahl: unsigned 32bit int should be enough
 eulerscheZahl: signed is not
 struct: yeah but not for entire board :p
 struct: Guess Ill have to use uint128
 jacek: bitboarding 2048? :scream:
 jacek: you can do 16k max using 64bit
 struct: maybe I got it wrong
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/648805599">https://www.codingame.com/replay/648805599</a>1.6 million on random seed
 struct: but 4 bits can store 16 different values jacek
 Psyho: random question: I tried that "optimization" from featured event (spreading fire thing), but I when I submit I got 0 score despite getting score on particular tests - is it because of the event, or am I using CG site wrong?
 jacek: struct 4*16 = 64 :O
 struct: The validators are different
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/902937ffd6835b98651e1318d4c7f07c062ac9">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/902937ffd6835b98651e1318d4c7f07c062ac9</a>
 jacek: so 16k per tile
 struct: Check if it times out on validators Psyho
 struct: might be easier to check the cause
 jacek: eulerscheZahl replay is slow
 Westicles: struct, 16/30 can only get 65k max, 14/30 can get 131k, 4/30 can get 131k+65k
 Westicles: in theory at least
 struct: thanks Westicles
 Psyho: struct: lol, I thought that those 8 cases were final so I can just hardcode the solution :D
 MSmits: usually there are tricks to getting the validators Psyho, so maybe you still can
 struct: well I just gave them to him :p
 MSmits: neat trick struct
 Psyho: yeah
 Psyho: so you don't really know if someone on the leaderboard exploited the knowledge of tests or not?
 Astrobytes: People will usually tell you if you ask them
 MSmits: Yeah we've come to accept that optimization arena's are locally solved 
 Psyho: sure, but it defeats the purpose of the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Lots of people do it offline and hardcode for the validators, others like the challenge of doing it online only
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Nothing we can do about it though.
 MSmits: well it's just a different leaderboard
 MSmits: one with no time limit
 Astrobytes: There's a reason we prefer TC for optims
 Psyho: from my perspective it's fine to do it offline, but it's just weird to have an additional layer that you have to reverse engineer in order to be able to hardcode the solution
 MSmits: yeah it wasnt originally intended to be this way
 Psyho: both offline and online are cool imho
 MSmits: there is one optim that's specifically intended to be solved offline: Numbershifting
 Psyho: but it's weird to make pseudo online
 Psyho: *make it
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's unintended behaviour that won't be fixed.
 Westicles: what is the purpose of the leaderboard?
 Psyho: thanks for the explanation though
 Psyho: yeah, that would require whole redesign of the site
 Westicles: oh, scroll
 Psyho: + you can always overfit to leaderboard which achieves the same thing
 MSmits: you mean in a bot game?
 MSmits: overfit on optim is pretty hard to do with many validators
 MSmits: some have like 50
 Westicles: I think offline training of bots for contests is much worse than offline search for optims
 jacek: nothing wrong with hardcoding optim if there is no upper bound like in travelling salesman
 Astrobytes: or hundreds and break CG
 Psyho: there are tons of ways to overfit with even infinite number of tests, it just takes more effort
 jacek: unlike*
 Psyho: even things like choosing a different RNG seed is overfitting
 MSmits: Psyho yeah thats what i meant, you can overfit, but the effort is somewhat prohibitive
 MSmits: i actually did the random seed thing before
 MSmits: in a bot game where my opponent was deterministic. Choosing a different seed changed my WR
 Astrobytes: Oware.
 MSmits: dots and boxes
 MSmits: before I found other ways to win
 Psyho: you can also detect the type of test and choose seed based on specific test
 jacek: books?
 Astrobytes: Ah, against crazy remi? Or the other guy?
 MSmits: no books
 MSmits: crazy remi yes
 jacek: you used.. math!?
 Astrobytes: I remember now
 MSmits: indeed math&#160;:)
 struct: That was done before for hidden validators Psyho during a contest
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Psyho: anyway, thanks for explanation
 eulerscheZahl: the most useless optim is the travelling salesman one
 eulerscheZahl: takes you 10 minutes to hardcode if you use an online solver
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/travelling-salesman">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/travelling-salesman</a>
 Astrobytes: and the author refused point blank to make any changes :shrug:
 jacek: approvers eh
 jacek: and at first it was about longest path
 Astrobytes: I explained myself in the forum discussion
 eulerscheZahl: i ranted in contributions comments
 Astrobytes: I liked our alternative version that we came up with
 eulerscheZahl: btw Psyho looks like they finally started system tests on topcoder. 2 users processed so far
 eulerscheZahl: ZLATKO and AjJi
 Psyho: euler: yeah, sullyper messegad me
 eulerscheZahl: that's easier than snorkling the API :D
 Psyho: I'm pretty sure I'll make it, I should have around 2.5 lead on both of them, and I'm sure I used way more tests locally (2K)
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't expect that final boost from you, where you added the +4 points. good luck on the system tests and hopefully see you in the finals
 eulerscheZahl: did they publish their code?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, yes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/colun/status/1542854163243356160?cxt=HHwWgMDSxfzrqOkqAAAA">https://twitter.com/colun/status/1542854163243356160?cxt=HHwWgMDSxfzrqOkqAAAA</a>
 Psyho: I already run it offline :D
 Psyho: I had 3 point lead on 1K seeds
 eulerscheZahl: i did the same with iehn's code for an earlier round. would be nice if topcoder could just handle it faster
 eulerscheZahl: and make me red already, i'm still yellow
 Psyho: oh yeah, I'm tired bitching about tc
 Psyho: the saving grace is really high problem quality, but that's because of community
 eulerscheZahl: then welcome here, where we bitch about CG
 Psyho: :D
 eulerscheZahl: this webchat will die in a week
 Psyho: I'm still optimistic about discord
 eulerscheZahl: as long as we don't get a !work command that is spammed in the wrong channels
 Astrobytes: :D
 Psyho: I guess this chat has the advantage of feeling very "temporary"
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 Psyho: like, you can write silly shit here and no one cares
 MSmits: :poop:
 Psyho: and on discord everyone can easily through all of the chat history
 eulerscheZahl: i know there is logging. but discord still feels less casual to me
 Astrobytes: well... there is the chat log here
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=World%2F&amp;namespace=3000">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=World%2F&amp;namespace=3000</a>
 Psyho: maybe it's just a different mindeset? I'm in like 20 different discord servers
 Psyho: and it feels very casual to me
 Astrobytes: I'm in a few too, but I like the immediacy of this webchat
 eulerscheZahl: i'm in several servers too. and muted all but announcements
 eulerscheZahl: and i direct link to your user profile
 Psyho: but mobile support is nice
 eulerscheZahl: makes it easier to spot a newbie where you have to start at the basics when answering
 j4at: What about embedding the discord chat in CG&#160;?
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/TitanEmbeds/Titan">https://github.com/TitanEmbeds/Titan</a>
 struct: They say its not an option
 abt8601: It's AGPL, though
 eulerscheZahl: if staff doesn't want to, that's usually final
 jacek: damn, i shall cancel my premium subscription for cg
 struct: I'll delete Y
 MSmits: Yinsh?
 struct: no MSmits
 Daporan: I still remember my first conversation on the chat in 2016
 struct: But I'm not being serious, ofc i'm not gonna delete it
 MSmits: :relieved:
 jacek: you have no ownership
 struct: I do
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ff9LXmm.png">https://i.imgur.com/ff9LXmm.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: what was it about Daporan?
 kovi: Psyho: on optim check my scores that is usually around the edge of no-hardcoding(not saying it is not possible to do better, as for tc i'm more in top10-20 and not better)
 eulerscheZahl: my first encounter was MK writing like a script kiddie, with all those acronyms and "u" instead of "you".then i closed the chat again for a few weeks but gave it another chance during the contest (hypersonic)
 eulerscheZahl: kovi i think you could have done better now. TC community is shrinking&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you can't delete an approved puzzle struct
 jacek: MK? the creator of mad pod racing?
 eulerscheZahl: the creator of my hate for it
 ellwn: eulerscheZahl: it was with SamSi and Bob and the chat was a small window on the bottom of the screen instead of on the right.
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i didn't know. but i remember SamSi. And Bob is still active
 eulerscheZahl: on the bottom, interesting
 Psyho: kovi:&#160;:+1:
 zakacat: :taco:
 kovi: Psyho another issue: testcases are not just too few, but scores are not balanced/relative (block fire is an exception), in some cases one good/bad testscore can dominate. so i usually do resubmits to have better than average results
 struct: same for code vs zombies
 struct: where there is a testcase that can give 400k rarely
 struct: validator*
 Psyho: kovi: I honestly prefer offline / hardcoding solutions for such problems
 Psyho: I like problems that combine heuristics with solving by hand
 Psyho: reminds me of challenge24 problems
 MSmits: google hash code is often like this
 MSmits: only you have like 4 hrs
 Psyho: yeah, except the problem usually sucks&#160;:)
 Psyho: last finals were kind of an exception
 eulerscheZahl: oh, hashcode finals already took place. how did it go for you?
 Psyho: massive f up on our side
 eulerscheZahl: team marathoners at rank 20?
 Psyho: bad split of subproblems and we went high risk high reward (more ambitious solutions, but we didn't finish them in time)
 eulerscheZahl: with 3 unsolved testcases (not counting A)
 Psyho: yeah
 Psyho: one person was doing two test cases that turned out to be the most important
 Psyho: but sullyper got the highest score on the last test, so a small win
 kovi: i think high r/r is a good approach for you
 eulerscheZahl: comforting to know that even you can screw up sometimes
 Psyho: depends, I feel that for hashcode you have to
 Psyho: but for things like TCO I usually go for low risk low reward
 Psyho: (maybe because I believe that I have a significant lead over everyone else)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 kovi:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: given your performance in the past i can't even contradict
 Psyho: but the performance is the result of going low risk low reward
 Psyho: a lot of people just go all in on a single approach
 kovi: we did the usual common base gredy approach. but failed to finish it in time to be able to adjust it by testcases(and later we saw that this time some test would require different very different greedy)
 Psyho: we messed up with navigation
 Psyho: tried to do something overcomplicated and never finished it in time
 Psyho: also, I implemented multithreading SA before the finals, so I was trying to fit SA anywhere in order to utilize power of ~100 cores :D
 kovi: yep. it was tricky. we ended up with simplified one (which cannot optim or even handle some cases)
 Astrobytes: lol Psyho, "new toy syndrome"
 Psyho: I tried it on some past problems and it was pretty cool to be able to use SA when every other solution was greedy
 Aldoggen: I'm trying to learn stuff from chat. does SA mean simulated annealing?
 Astrobytes: yep
 Aldoggen: thanks!
 BlaiseEbuth: Hope you're a quick learner...
 Aldoggen: XD
 Astrobytes: indeed 
 Aldoggen: don't make me sad again
 BlaiseEbuth: Oy there o/
 eulerscheZahl: any thoughts on the new TCO23 format?
 Astrobytes: hey Blaise \o
 eulerscheZahl: hey blaise, haven't seen you for a long time
 Psyho: there's a new format!? TIL
 Astrobytes: I convinced him it was safe to come in last night euler&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tco23.topcoder.com/how-to-qualify">https://tco23.topcoder.com/how-to-qualify</a>
 Aldoggen: would SA be usable for the mars lander optimization? since it's essentially discrete thrust, discrete angle and discrete time steps?
 BlaiseEbuth: oy euler
 eulerscheZahl: stages are less relevant. you have a 9 month leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: looks exhausting to me to compete for 9 months
 Astrobytes: but you will
 eulerscheZahl: no a plus side they did the split between data science and marathon
 mamasheni123: how old are u guys?
 eulerscheZahl: 30 :older:man:

 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: Yes I think it's a valid approach for mars lander
 BlaiseEbuth: What type of contest is it?
 eulerscheZahl: optimization
 Aldoggen: Astrobytes thanks! I'll have to consider that then
 kovi: oh, marathon and ds split?
 eulerscheZahl: some have animations. you are supposed to work offline and then submit your code. 2000 testcases for final ranks
 eulerscheZahl: yes, finally split
 Astrobytes: should be less confusing to find things at least
 eulerscheZahl: see my last link, it lists the tracks there
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh wait. I know that thing. It's the maze site right?
 eulerscheZahl: maze site?
 kovi: yes...webpage is gets more cryptic each year

 Astrobytes: the one you wander around and find nothing you were looking for
 eulerscheZahl: aah, now i got it :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: The worst UX ever. First challenge was to find the challenge page
 eulerscheZahl: you havent seen the new mobile version of leaderboards

 Astrobytes: my... eyes...
 eulerscheZahl: they acknowledged the issue and are working on it
 Astrobytes: might be updated within the decade then
 Psyho: the insane part about topcoder is that it's a crowdsourcing platform where they build software (including UI/UX) for other companies
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Psyho: they must have amazing bizdevs if they are able to get any clients
 eulerscheZahl: they even use it for their own. e.g. the new TCO23 logo is from such a contest
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's never quite sat right with me :D
 Psyho: topcoder is a site that I use as example of terrible UX
 Psyho: it's probably the worst site I have ever used
 BlaiseEbuth: I saw that RAIC popped too.
 Astrobytes: not wrong there Psyho :D
 eulerscheZahl: i still use the bookmark that kovi gave me to find current contests
 Psyho: feel free to screenshot this and send to TC stuff :D
 Aldoggen: I looked it up. it's loading slowly lol
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC: you need a Russian bank account to win anything (not sure if that includes tshirts)
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth yeah RAIC this month, still waiting to hear back from anyone regarding the prize situation
 Psyho: oh yeah, it also logs you out every 24h
 struct: euler not only winning 
 struct: but to play competitive
 Psyho: and reloads every component on the page several times
 Astrobytes: that is very, very annoying
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh...
 eulerscheZahl: the logout...and the login takes 10-15s
 Astrobytes: and don't get me started on the emails
 eulerscheZahl: i unsubscribed to one of their newsletters - or so i thought. seems i unsubscribed to everything
 Psyho: I'd imagine every 6 months they hire a new UI person and they quit soon after
 Psyho: euler: same for me
 Psyho: and then I couldn't sign up for it again
 Astrobytes: PTSD for life after that job
 Psyho: and admin had to manually change somewhere in the db
 Astrobytes: I don't understand why so much is done manually on TC
 A_W1534: wait till you guys find out about discord
 eulerscheZahl: and i'd like to change my email address. can't do it myself and don't want to bother staff with it
 Psyho: because it doesn't work otherwise
 Astrobytes: there must be a seriously bad underlying issue there
 Psyho: I can't edit my bio now on my profile page (probably broken with the new update)
 Psyho: discord is fine imo
 eulerscheZahl: better than private TC forum
 eulerscheZahl: somehow they haven't added simanman to the finalists channel still
 Psyho: hm, well actually the way they designed discord server is rather atrocious 
 Psyho: lol
 Psyho: does jessie now?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should tell her. and siman probably doesn't know such a channel exists as it's hidden
 Astrobytes: lol, how very topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: i'll be nice and tell them
 eulerscheZahl: or i wait until stage 4 officially ends and they add everyone?no, they'll forget to check stage 3 players probably
 Astrobytes: hahaha, most likely

 Psyho: I'll just message her now
 Astrobytes: struct: it got unpinned
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: ok. if you do it, i'll sit it out. no need for 2 messages

 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes what got unpinned? the chat discussion is still pinned
 eulerscheZahl: you just don't see it as pinned when you opened it before. use incognito mode

 Psyho: euler: I've read the rules but it's unclear to me how does thq qualification system is going to work
 Psyho: I'm not sure if the infographic even applies to Algo/MM
 Psyho: oh, I guess it is mentioned it applies to Marathon
 kovi: details may not matter for You...you win 1-2 match and that is it
 kovi:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: here's the full text: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tco23.topcoder.com/competition-rules">https://tco23.topcoder.com/competition-rules</a>
 eulerscheZahl: as i read it: 9 months scoreboard, top6 = finalists
 eulerscheZahl: then top6 of each stage (that is top6 except finalists??) go to another round. top4 to finals, then 2 more finalists from regionals
 Psyho: I kind of miss a time where you could participate in one match and qualify
 BlaiseEbuth: Nine months... That's a real marathon
 Psyho: but tbf, nowawadays matches are single week
 eulerscheZahl: 3 months is already a lot of investment
 Psyho: yeah, that's way too much
 Psyho: I like 1-2 matches where you try to do your best vs others that try to their best
 Psyho: rather than grinding out 5+ matches
 kovi: i agree. but you are good enough to not care. our mortals should pick a state and focus
 kovi: (we, the mortals)
 Astrobytes: *us mortals would be better kovi
 kovi: thx
 Astrobytes: np
 eulerscheZahl: he will get as many points in 4 matches as we do in 8-9
 tchet_nt: chào mấy con chó
 eulerscheZahl: that's not very polite
 Astrobytes: :dog:
 Astrobytes: wtf. That dog emoji is... vaguely terrifying
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 BlaiseEbuth: He wanna eat us&#160;! :scream:
 kovi: eulerscheZahl as i see from 3x6 only 4 will qualifyothers will compete in regionals (mixed with regional tops?)
 tchet_nt: That's my country's language, I translate it into English, so hello everyone
 Astrobytes: hi&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Pretty sure he didn't said that... -_-
 tchet_nt: What language do you speak?
 tchet_nt:&#160;:)
 MSmits: nerd
 Astrobytes: translation is not always correct though Blaise
 MSmits: (I speak nerd)
 tchet_nt: oh come on is it so hard to say hello
 eulerscheZahl: 4 of the others will compete in regionals kovi.but i suppose that the top6 per stage are mostly qualified for regionals anyways
 BlaiseEbuth: Hello seems to be the hardest word...
 tchet_nt: hi dog right
 BlaiseEbuth: Knew it... -_-
 Astrobytes: you call each other dogs?

 BlaiseEbuth: Can I be a cat instead?
 tchet_nt: in my country they talk really well, of course you can if you want
 kovi: eulerscheZahl 8 of the other in regionals. as i see everything will be decided in the regional wildcard round.
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks :smiley_cat:
 tchet_nt: do you know c#?
 eulerscheZahl: only 2 spots from regionals
 eulerscheZahl: 6 from 9 months leaderboard and 4 from a single round of top6 per stage

 jacek: HenroLST tuple?
 HenroLST: jacek, thanks!
 dager12: you were just talking to my ai
 dager12: rate it
 HenroLST: :thumbsup:
 jacek: Automaton2000 rate it
 Automaton2000: as far as i have
 HenroLST: Automaton2000 this is your new compeition
 Automaton2000: wouldn't it be better to do
 HenroLST: if i were to have a tuple in a queue how would i access the indiv elements of the tuple? is there like an indexing like .first or -&gt;first?
 struct: .first
 struct: .second .third
 HenroLST: so queue.front().first?
 struct: yes
 HenroLST: when i try it errors a message of no such thing of .first in tuple
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo

 BlaiseEbuth: Do you really nead a find method for only 2 elements?
 HenroLST: but uh back to my question, is it possible to search for a pair in a tuple using something like .find()?
 HenroLST: uh yeah
 MSmits: you can just create a function for it...
 HenroLST: im doing a queue for a search where it uses tuples as the main queue, first 2 coords, third the depth of search
 jacek: search in tuple or search in list of tuples
 HenroLST: list
 jacek: find with some lambda function?
 HenroLST: oh yeah i could do that... mb im pretty tired rn
 BlaiseEbuth: Not sure tuple is the right structure for this...
 HenroLST: im just going off of a wiki page provided on the puzzle. is my first time doing pathfinding
 Astrobytes: perhaps a node struct?
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 Astrobytes: if you need the extra info
 MSmits: perhaps a node or a struct?
 MSmits: or are you asking struct?&gt;
 Astrobytes: class-y MSmits
 MSmits: :grin:
 HenroLST: hmm
 BlaiseEbuth: Or even any data homogenous data structure since your 3 values are numbers
 BlaiseEbuth: std::array&lt;int, 3&gt;
 HenroLST: ngl dont know much about structs, i started learning c++ like a month/2 ago and ive been going off of reading articles and c++ reference :sweat_smile:
 BlaiseEbuth:  same as classes but with public elements by default
 MSmits: struct is pretty easy to understand
 MSmits: just is confusing coming from C# or other languages where structs are different from classes
 HenroLST: ok, ill go read into that then, thanks a lot everyone&#160;!
 Astrobytes: for plain old data (POD) structs are what you want
 jacek: struct eh
 HenroLST: ok, i came from basic logic form my schols basic comp sci principles class :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: If you need to start having fancy constructors or overloaded operators, anything not public, etc etc then use a class
 HenroLST: okie
 jacek: struct is like exhibisionit class
 MSmits: everything is exposed
 eulerscheZahl: in c# a struct simply is a value type
 MSmits: yeah, but this is a huge difference with a C# class
 DevMarcao: bros I wanna play clash of code just the shortest clashes
 DevMarcao: is that possible?
 eulerscheZahl: which is also why you can't nest structs likestruct MyStruct {
 jacek: DevMarcao no. only in private clashes
 HenroLST: oh wow structs actually look pretty useful :grinning:
 HenroLST: wait can i make like a list or vector of structs?
 jacek: and they make decent mods
 HenroLST: or is that a no no
 MSmits: yes 
 DevMarcao: thanks jacek
 MSmits: you can and should
 struct: your first line of c++ should always be this for performance
 struct: #define class structclass Class{};
 jacek: its like list of classes (objects)
 HenroLST: woohoo ok that sounds amazing, thanks again all!
 j4at: structs are named tuples
 Astrobytes: struct: rofl:

 HenroLST: wait you can use codinggame on a phone?
 HenroLST: dang that would be tough to code anything
 MSmits: yeah i think so, pretty crappy though
 Astrobytes: Illedan does that all the time
 Astrobytes: or used to
 HenroLST: dedication 100
 eulerscheZahl: he shared a screenshot recently. first time i saw CG mobile
 HenroLST: coding on and off the comp
 Astrobytes: from a hammock in a forest once too
 MSmits: low tech vacation
 MSmits: only 1 machine
 jacek: if you won phone, you would use it as well
 HenroLST: imagine having more than 1
 MSmits: true
 HenroLST: YES IT SORT OF WORKS
 Astrobytes: EXCELLENT WHY ARE WE SHOUTING
 HenroLST: I DONT KNOW IM EXCITED
 Astrobytes: :D
 HenroLST: :grinning:
 jacek: hm?
 HenroLST: well uh this is awkward, it worked for 2 iterations but cant output in a full scenario due to too long :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: too long? In execution time?
 HenroLST: ye
 Astrobytes: Do you terminate the search?
 HenroLST: pretty sure i did but ima check real quick
 Astrobytes: just output something from the relevant part to cerr and if it goes on and on and on and on it might be infinite
 HenroLST: it stopped at 7 so it did terminate
 HenroLST: hm
 BlaiseEbuth: 7 is almost infinite
 Astrobytes: :D
 HenroLST: heh wait really? its a counter of eah time my loop runs
 Astrobytes: to 7... and beyond!
 HenroLST: dang it had hopes it wouldf work first try&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: welcome to coding and debugging!
 BlaiseEbuth: Ye! o/
 HenroLST: for real, debugging sucks, i spent a whole afternoon on this one puzzle only to realize i had a typo due to 2 vars being similar, ans and an
 Astrobytes: If it works first time in C++ it usually has a fairly serious bug anyway :P
 HenroLST: :joy:
 BlaiseEbuth: If you don't like debug, don't put bugs in your code in the first place.
 Astrobytes: name your variables better&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth aka "never code anything"
 HenroLST: i always start with big descriptive var names and end up shortening them to 1-4 letter names every time

 Aldoggen: glad you figured out you need a visited list because I think I forgot to tell you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I would have expected worse from FR so I think you're getting off lightly :D
 HenroLST: hehe
 HenroLST: im still more interested as to why i broke out at the exit coords but +1 to each
 Westicles: yeah, I think maybe the dislike goes beyond fr this time.  could actually be based on the content
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth begin to whistle softly.</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: HenroLST: possibly adding the same one twice
 Westicles: Blaise, was in the mpox or the kissing?
 HenroLST: uh could you elaborate
 Westicles: *it
 Aldoggen: I think he means you possibly have the same node twice or something
 BlaiseEbuth: mpox?
 Westicles: monkeypox
 Astrobytes: HenroLST: you may have added the first node twice, or the last
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles 08:47ᴾᴹthough there was a mean comment: Contrib sans interet
 HenroLST: ah, lemme check
 Westicles: heh heh
 BlaiseEbuth: Neither of them concerning fr
 HenroLST: ohh found it, it was a indexing error cause the answer wasnt nessecarily the last in my list
 Astrobytes: fr just hate you Westicles, ain't nothing gonna change that :D
 Astrobytes: HenroLST: tada:
 Astrobytes: grrr
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 HenroLST: yay it works
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not wrong for some of them. Doesn't mean the comments can't be on point. :speak_no_evil:
 Astrobytes: Nice one, well done!
 HenroLST: now to find the best path based on my giant list of coords :sweat_smile:
 HenroLST: thanks astrobytes!
 Astrobytes: you should have the best path in the list of coords
 HenroLST: hm
 HenroLST: lemme see 
 HenroLST: well thats awkward
 Astrobytes: HenroLST: here's a site I think you should spend a lil time on<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a>
 Astrobytes: Lots of interactive/animated examples for all sorts of graph searches, just focus on the breadth first search stuff for now
 Astrobytes: Also, pseudocode, python code and C++ code to look at
 eulerscheZahl: this website was just linked for the 13th time in known chat history
 Astrobytes: I bet 12 of those were me
 HenroLST: thanks! ill go delve into it
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't extract that
 Astrobytes: your next job :P
 Astrobytes: the word cloud was fun, link cloud might be too
 HenroLST: geez this is the most tabs ive had ever since i got this comp
 Astrobytes: save your bookmarks sensibly, don't try to look at everything at once
 eulerscheZahl: try python, then you will see a lot more tabs
 Astrobytes: easy to get overloaded
 eulerscheZahl: or spaces :thinking:
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Astrobytes: lets call them "indents"
 Westicles: I need a tougher probability problem.  It was supposed to be easier to solve it numerically but the first guy plugged away and solved it anyhow
 Jay10890: anyone got solution to mars lander
 Astrobytes: 12
 Jay10890:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: 42
 Aldoggen: or possibly 13
 Jay10890: what the numbers mean
 Aldoggen: yeah, I think 13 would work too
 Astrobytes: is that the same guy?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, he asked yesterday
 Jay10890: whats the numbers for
 Astrobytes: thought so euler
 eulerscheZahl: we only know that 42 is the answer
 eulerscheZahl: but we don't know for what
 Jay10890: thats not code
 Astrobytes: they are as meaningful as your question
 Aldoggen: you're not code
 Jay10890: :skull:
 Westicles: what's tougher than:Given an American roulette wheel with 38 possible outcomes (0-36 or 00), what are the odds of landing on at least m different numbers in n spins?
 Astrobytes: mars lander is not difficult, just read the statement a few times and focus on what you need to do
 eulerscheZahl: lvl7. so we would at least need lvl8 as a prerequisite for the chat
 Astrobytes: 10 would be better tbh, and it's a nicer number than 7
 Aldoggen: I don't think having levels function as prerequisite is the right way to go about it
 Jay10890: is there a github link for mars lander
 Aldoggen: should be number of days on the site imo
 Astrobytes: it's a start Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: idk
 Aldoggen: yep
 Aldoggen: though number of days is also not ideal
 Astrobytes: number of days on site can be schoolkids who come on here during class to solve a problem their teacher linked them but spam instead, for weeks on end
 Westicles: email verfication?
 eulerscheZahl: and everyone below gets another chat where they can troll each other
 Astrobytes: The Pit of Despair
 Astrobytes: I'd prefer they couldn't chat at all, but could see regular chat
 Astrobytes: it would weed out a few idiots at least
 eulerscheZahl: read-only? that would need code changes
 Westicles: if you just shadowban US ip addresses that would do it. 
 Astrobytes: plenty kids from all over spamming this place, not just US
 Westicles: well, then put access the chat on the quest map. 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: As the last quest?
 Astrobytes: (before contributions that is)
 Westicles: maybe before creating a contrib
 Westicles: ha, yeah
 Astrobytes: heh
 struct: reach wood 1 on br 2048
 struct: should be the requirement
 Jay10890: pablo
 Astrobytes: salvador
 Aldoggen: pablo is my great uncle
 Astrobytes: This is naming spanish artists right?
 struct: chat is getting removed and we dont know yet what happens when we remove a boss from a league
 Astrobytes: Only one way to find out :D
 struct: maybe amazons can be the test
 struct: doesnt have that many players
 Swimy: Question about this problem?
 Swimy: Im trying ti find my inputs here in c++ version of temperatures 
 Swimy: I see it expressed as T but if I need to put it into an array that is fine
 jacek: t?
 Swimy: Might just do it in c#
 jacek: they give you one temperature at time
 Astrobytes: your chosen language is not the problem I suspect
 jacek: youd need to put them into array or list yourself anyway
 struct: maybe I shouldnt test this during the weekend
 struct: What if cg break
 struct: s
 jacek: :imp:
 struct: euler is not online I'll test it tomorrow
 struct: Automaton2000 remind me
 Automaton2000: are you saying to me
 Astrobytes: he's on discord
 Astrobytes: ping him :P
 struct: too much work
 Astrobytes: well, you really should test these things live on fridays struct
 BlaiseEbuth: Friday afternoon is release time!
 Astrobytes: evening is better for us :smiling_imp:
 BlaiseEbuth: And I'm the toxic troll...
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 jacek:  
 Astrobytes: I told you it was safe in here BlaiseEbuth&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the moment when tacos pop...
 Astrobytes: haven't seen tacos in days
 Astrobytes: regardless, I think we're all just having a bit of fun since this is all gonna disappear so soon anyway
 Aldoggen: speaking about that, who of you will I see on discord?
 jacek: last days of trolling&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: me
 MSmits: I'll go there
 sqoor: hi
 jacek: discord shows thumbnails of youtube
 sqoor: I am looking for a date 
 Aldoggen: all right
 jacek: 4/20
 MSmits: jacek will this make it harder to rickroll us?
 Aldoggen: try yesterday
 Astrobytes: 5/7/77
 sqoor: who wanna be my date
 Astrobytes: duh
 Astrobytes: 5/8/77
 Astrobytes: ^ the date
 sqoor: lol
 MSmits: i didnt know you were older than me Astrobytes
 sqoor: good one 
 Aldoggen: no you're a good one
 Aldoggen: now be good and be gone
 Astrobytes: I'm not MSmits
 sqoor: when it's come to programming, date is the hardest subject for me 
 MSmits: ahh  so you're not from  '77 then
 sqoor: I don't know how to handle that 
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII wants you to stop making him feel old</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: sorry PatrickMcGinnisII :grin:
 Astrobytes: MSmits: That's the (americanised) version of the universally accepted most-easily-listenable-and-consistent Grateful Dead concert, Barton Hall, Ithaca, NY
 MSmits: o
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I saw the Irish rovers mar. '77
 Astrobytes: 5/8/77 - there are even conspiracy theories that it never happened because it is so good (I don't get that)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my first concert
 Astrobytes: punk Patrick?
 MSmits: PunkMcGinissll
 Astrobytes: I like it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: How is folk music punk?
 Astrobytes: Well, the Pogues made it so
 Aldoggen: if you wait long enough, punk becomes folk
 Astrobytes: And a lot of folk stuff is pretty punk in attitude alone, throughout history and before punk
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was 7, and every1 was dancing jigs in the isles ... very entertaining
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is now old</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> Aldoggen: grr nothing more annoying than sequences that start to diverge from each other after a few elements
 Astrobytes: Oh, Canadian band The Irish Rovers? PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: I totally get this PatrickMcGinnisII, everything was lighter before WWI and WWII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have nested foreach loops that won't fully loop, stupid php
 Aldoggen: that's what he said 5 mins ago
 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: these are not the sequences you are looking for
 Aldoggen: one of them is
 Aldoggen: but it's too expensive to calculate
 Aldoggen: and the other apparently doesn't want to be it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well they are Irish, as am I despite being a Yank
 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: Irish Rovers is a broad name, that's half the Irish bands across europe
 Astrobytes: ofc PatrickMcGinnisII that's a given
 Astrobytes: but they hail from Canada
 Astrobytes: nowt wrong wi that
 Astrobytes: I saw the Dubliners at Royal Albert Hall right before Barney died
 Astrobytes: They were obviously a shadow of themselves at that point anyway but Barney kept it going in the right way
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My roots are traceable back to the 9th century, my GF is mostly a Scot. - explains my bad attitude most of the time
 Astrobytes: I don't find yer attitude bad
 MSmits: wait, why would it explain *your* bad attitude anyways?
 MSmits: if she's scottish, wouldn't that explain hers? I dunno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I suffer from the Hawaiian disease LackONookie ... always in the dog house
 Astrobytes: What? Us Scots are made of stardust and nice things MSmits, as are all the Celts
 MSmits: I see, well I thought you were the exception
 Astrobytes: (now that's a long list :D)
 Astrobytes: I'm made of buckfast and jobbies!
 Astrobytes: (not really)
 Aldoggen: I'm made of sugar and spice and everything nice
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: "Hawaiian disease" :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kentucky Bourbon isn't the leg spreader whiskey that yall have over there
 Astrobytes: "leg spreader" wtf dude
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Puzzle: How to make her knees mad at each other /  Solution: add liquor
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok i give up
 Astrobytes: I'm actually made of snips of/and snails and puppydogs tails
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII believes you</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: Continuing the rhyme from Aldoggen PatrickMcGinnisII
 Aldoggen: noice )
 Aldoggen: I was wondering whether you'd have picked up on that reference
 Astrobytes: people of my generation would have, I think some others wouldn't, at least here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I'll behave in chat ... the fairer sex may be present
 Aldoggen: I forgot your age already Astrobytes
 Aldoggen: 23?
 Astrobytes: Old
 Aldoggen: ah
 Aldoggen: well XD
 Astrobytes: Nope, 40 in a month or so
 Aldoggen: well, almost gratz then&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: heh
 Astrobytes: almost thanks I guess
 Aldoggen: my generation had the powerpuff girls to learn that song
 Aldoggen: no, just part of the lyrics i guess
 Astrobytes: I watched the powerpuff girls as a teen ffs
 Aldoggen: wait wot?
 Astrobytes: it was on then
 Astrobytes: it was on Cartoon Network in the mid-late 90s
 Aldoggen: trying to calculate lol
 Astrobytes: my three cousins had, until recently, the nicknames Bubbles, Buttercup and Blossom
 Aldoggen: you're from 82 right?
 Astrobytes: Yup
 Aldoggen: that's cute tho&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: so you could have watched it by age 13
 Aldoggen: in '95
 Astrobytes: Was on TV around then yeah
 Aldoggen: I guess they kept playing it till when I was I guess about 9 or 10
 Astrobytes: maybe a little later, I think when I was 14 or so
 Aldoggen: like around 07-08
 Aldoggen: so for more than a decade
 Astrobytes: What's not to love? Why not keep repeating it, was a classic!
 Aldoggen: true&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: didn't expect it tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if I nest a foreach of an associative array inside a foreach of an iterative, php barfs without an error...wth
 Aldoggen: though I did see an ad on tv with images that are at least 5 years old
 Astrobytes: re-runs are the new 'new'
 Aldoggen: PatrickMcGinnisII lmao
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: what have I told you about this PHP nonsense?
 Aldoggen: I've been laughing nonstop for the last minute over that
 Aldoggen: something about patrick doing something that sounds to me very overengineered, and php just being like "nope, I'm out of here" gets me
 Astrobytes: You just defined Patrick
 Aldoggen: all right&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I've been trying to get him to switch back to something sensible like C for years now
 Astrobytes: He's older than me, he should know better eh PatrickMcGinnisII
 boumagik: Hello world
 Astrobytes: tbf though, he knows some PHP, that's for sure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a tendancy to rewrite Assembler::Assembler when i do C++
 Astrobytes: just do some C, it's fine
 Aldoggen: hmm I don't know much about c++ but that sure doesn't sound kosher
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's an insanity that I picked up back when 16-bit compilers first came out
 Astrobytes: there's nothing wrong with optimising but ffs dude you use PHP
 Aldoggen: and I thought I was insane for writing all my math funcitons myself in java
 Aldoggen: ayy top 400 in CoC
 Astrobytes: grats
 PatrickMcGinnisII: And I did alot of Java as well.  So many things just to output a simple graphic ... so I write websites and custom graphics routines in php because it's just lazy/easier.  Even the php cli graphics converters I run are easily modified w/o IDE and compiler overhead.  I'll drop some fast lang. stuff here and there eventually.
 Astrobytes: PHP for the job is fine, and even puzzles! (I like your commitment in that regard) but everything else on here man, jeezus
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, it's very limiting.  I'm reworking Galleon wars with a probability of collision detector to see if I can play without the depths others search to
 Astrobytes: wtf is galleon wars
 Astrobytes: ohhh coders of the caribbean 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Green Circle event game me an idea about it.  Code of Caribean.  
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I hate the new names btw
 Astrobytes: You and most others
 Astrobytes: The anti squid was responsible for a fair few of those
 Astrobytes: euler's was Death First Search
 Astrobytes: None of mine were accepted
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I like the movie nerd names
 Astrobytes: like CvZ should be called The Evil Thread
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :thumbsup:

 Aldoggen: I am not&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I was caught up in a particularly annoying coc
 Astrobytes: ah I misread
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nested foreach's startoing working when I added the option key to the interative loop
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 Astrobytes: iterative
 PatrickMcGinnisII: later
 Aldoggen: someone thought it was a good idea to include wrong data in their coc which I had to fish out
 Astrobytes: b0n5a1: I recommended an fr takeover of world earlier before the chat dies, it has to be at a busy time 
 Aldoggen: I don't know how that got approved
 Astrobytes: nobody quite knows why half of those clashes get approved
 Aldoggen: lmao
 b0n5a1: :D
 Astrobytes: it has to be done!
 Astrobytes: if we can't keep it we can at least remember the last few days of it with fondness ^^
 Aldoggen: we need to make a browser addon that adds it back or something lol
 Astrobytes: there will be some alternative after but nothing will be the same as this one
 Astrobytes: *alternatives

 waterproofsodium: how would you figure out the probabilities shares as integers of a strongly connected component?

 waterproofsodium: I think I have a solution, but it involves a linear equation solver and that makes me unhappy haha

 Alexandru.Teodor: Hi! Do you know how to find the last problem from clash of code? I want to read it again after the clash ended
 5DN1L: try searching here
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Alexandru.Teodor: Thanks
 5DN1L: np
 Quace: What does send game parameters to IDE do? Can i link this game to my IDE?
 5DN1L: it replaces the players under your code
 5DN1L: and other settings associated with the game
 5DN1L: so you can play the same game outside arena
 5DN1L: and you can experiment with it with different codes outside arena
 Quace: Aaah ok I get it! Thank you so much!
 5DN1L: np

 MSmits: hey, chat is not dead yet
 Aldoggen: don't jinx it&#160;:)
 User_xin: Hey, guys, the time from nine to five has expired
 MSmits: the time?
 MSmits: also it's noon in France
 User_xin: yes  there is time difference.
 User_xin: Mine is Chinese time:laughing:
 User_xin: lol
 relimS: I am on Power of Thor. Is West supposed to increase x or decrease x?
 Aldoggen: decrease
 relimS: oh ok
 Aldoggen: (0, 0) is in the upper left corner
 relimS: now that makes sense
 relimS: I will need to read the rules carefully next time
 Aldoggen: it's the most used coordinate system here
 Aldoggen: yep&#160;:)
 relimS: ok thanks
 Aldoggen: np&#160;:)
 mrsridhar: morratu noob
 MorratuNoob: hi
 MorratuNoob: :innocent:
 mrsridhar: how are you bro
 PrimeDecay: MORRATU NOOB FTW!!!!!!
 PrimeDecay: Big fan brooo
 mrsridhar: morratu noob army
 relimS:&#160;?
 PrimeDecay: The best programmer to exist!
 MorratuNoob: :no_mouth:
 PrimeDecay: @relimS MorratuNoob is a programming prodigy!
 relimS: oh ok
 PrimeDecay: He's sooo goood at programming
 PrimeDecay: idk how he mastered
 lianimator: Vim users, how do use it in CoC. it's so buggy for me
 relimS: most people here probably use VSCode is Sublime
 relimS: pr*
 relimS: or*
 relimS: I cannot type
 lianimator: do you mean, doing a clash outside the browser?
 relimS: Coding doesn't have to be a clash.
 lianimator: oh, what i meant was, in the Clash of Code game, there's a VIM mode, but it's buggy for me. For instance, searching with / only works the first time. Do other VIM users have this problem?
 relimS: you can choose modes? that's cool
 relimS: This is my first hour on the site so I don't know anything
 lianimator: :D my first 24 hrs
 jacek: other vim user havent exit yet
 lianimator: no wonder..
 relimS: :wq
 lianimator: :q!
 relimS: \/\/ A single line providing the move to be made: N NE E SE S SW W or NWMe: send all moves separated by a white space 
 relimS: Can't I escape letters?
 relimS: like \(
 DaNinja: chat is gone if you refresh the tab&#160;:(
 jacek: so, never refresh
 jacek: let it be last link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 DaNinja: haha
 Aldoggen: rip chat I guess
 jacek: relimS if you want to debug, write to stderr
 relimS: no. I misread the comment
 relimS: I went from misreading the rules to the comment
 Aldoggen: I guess I'll have to put my laptop in hibernate from now on. can't let this tab unload
 relimS: the new messages won't show up though
 relimS: also your browser will probably reload after boot up
 relimS: Expected: SWstdout: WS
 relimS: I didn't realize I need to put the S before the W
 relimS: There is a friends system? I can finally get a friend
 Aldoggen: browser won't reload when you come out of hibernate
 relimS: I would expect it to because the TCP connections have to be reformed
 relimS: Rules:For some tests, the bombs' location may change from one execution to the other: the goal is to help you find the best algorithm in all cases.Me: I thought it is a Binary search
 jacek: it is
 relimS: what really is a binary search?
 relimS: I think I might have got the wrong idea of its definition
 Chris1874: :grimacing:
 jacek: generally you take middle number and see if its higher or lower
 jacek: then take middle number from the smaller interval etc.
 relimS: I kinda got it now
 jacek: its like guess the number game
 relimS: Is there a RAM limit? I am writing in C so I don't know if I need to free() my array or not.
 jacek: 768MB
 jacek: for puzzles mostly you wont use that much and you can ignore free()
 relimS: That's should be plenty for me to be lazy about
 relimS: with*
 Westicles: huh
 relimS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e53a74e4-8193-466f-9d7a-afaa02790c97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e53a74e4-8193-466f-9d7a-afaa02790c97</a>
 relimS: why is it sending in a pastebin
 relimS: char bomb_dir[4];scanf("%s", bomb_dir);definition of buffer overflow
 jacek: long lines are automatically converted to pastebin but its broken. and chat is being closed so they wont fix it
 jacek: who uses C nowadays ;d
 relimS: me
 Westicles: is it closed already?
 relimS: Me don't need high level garbage collector
 Aldoggen: it should be if you refresh
 Aldoggen: so don't 
 relimS: C gives low level access to mem so I can make full use of pi 0
 BlaiseEbuth: They removed the webchat but not the xmpp server?
 Aldoggen: I guess
 Westicles: they don't know how
 Aldoggen: unless that one guy that said it was trolling
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil:
 Aldoggen: I wonder if there are still mods looking at the chat
 relimS: there is actually no chat function when I load it on a new tab
 Aldoggen: all right
 relimS: RIP chat. You will never be forgotten
 jacek: theres still discord :unamused:
 dwarfie: where is the dislike button ....?
 relimS: it is not as convenient
 Aldoggen: god dammit I'm choing in coc
 Westicles: first they sell out to evil americans, then delete chat, next they'll start killing dolphins
 darkhorse64: worst, kitties
 Aldoggen: blind helpless kitties that are shaking from the cold
 dwarfie: and no more people talking on bullshit discord :D
 relimS: if this is the last day of chat, I wonder what message is the last one
 dwarfie: this is the first day .... of the end of the community CG
 darkhorse64: post until nobody replies and you will know
 Aldoggen: this will probably be the last link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 relimS: it won't
 Aldoggen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 Aldoggen: I will make it so
 relimS: I also recognize that video id
 Aldoggen: no you don't. it's different
 relimS: I used to Rick Roll people
 Aldoggen: click on it and you'll see it's different
 relimS: the first 3 letters match so there is no way I am clicking
 Aldoggen: XD
 relimS: Is anyone here?
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 dwarfie: :rofl:
 Aldoggen: day 100: I still haven't refreshed. My friends have gone one by one. Most of them by accident. Once only a few were left, some decided to do it on purpose, because they couldn't handle the grief. One by one, my last friends disappeared. 
 Aldoggen: Every day I think about it.
 Aldoggen: On some days, my cursor moves dangerously close to the refresh button
 Aldoggen: But I cannot leave yet
 Aldoggen: I am not done yet
 Aldoggen: I need to show them
 Aldoggen: I need to show them what they have done
 Aldoggen: the grief they have caused
 relimS: The friends section isn't removed though
 Aldoggen: The bonds they have torn
 Aldoggen: I am not done. I will show them. I will stay here. No matter what.
 Aldoggen: thanks for ruining my monologue&#160;;)
 relimS: you are welcome
 relimS: I'll will ruin it every day
 Aldoggen: lol
 Westicles: some have firefox and the memory usage will grow until it crashes
 Aldoggen: lmao
 Aldoggen: chrome is also pretty heavy on memory
 Aldoggen: though maybe I should close some tabs
 darkhorse64: don't forget to turn off Windows updates
 relimS: I am one Linux so I have an advantage there
 relimS: on*
 dwarfie: about:memory is your friend .... auto discard tab plugin too
 Aldoggen: hmm, I killed half of chrome's memory usage by killing tab processes
 jacek: murderer
 relimS: I think it might be possible to save the tab's state and load it again later
 relimS: theoretically possible
 Aldoggen: I'd rather murder processes than let them murder my laptop
 Aldoggen: I was thinking that too

 relimS: It is the chat function's code
 relimS: I dug up that from chromium dev tools
 relimS: just need to find a way to add the element
 relimS: Is it
 relimS: I just read through the names. I didn't check the syntaxes
 jacek: Automaton2000 are you there
 Automaton2000: if they are in the middle of the board
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth look sadly  with the few others external client users thewebchat users disapearing one after the others while the xmpp server is still up...</b></p><p><img src="/a/75369242083208" /> jacek: :tada:

 relimS: test
 relimS: oh. I am still online
 relimS: Is anyone still here?
 Aldoggen: it's fun to let you sweat for a bit&#160;:)
 relimS: I have a plan. Save the current session to a file and disable any cross site scripting preventions
 relimS: "chatServerUrl":"chat.codingame.com","chatPort":443
 relimS: huh
 relimS: the code for chat is still there but the css elements seems to be removed
 Aldoggen: lol
 relimS: I should be able to find some html ejection Chrome plugins
 relimS: eject the chat function back
 jacek: think about all those people who wont be rick rolled&#160;:(
 relimS: I mean, the chat server isn't down
 Aldoggen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 relimS: hello
 Aldoggen: \o
 relimS: I wonder if there is an extension to eject html code?
 BlaiseEbuth: eject&#160;?
 relimS: like overriding the html
 relimS: the console cannot hold enough input data
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Extensions like ViolentMonkey allow you to execute js scripts on the page and to modify all the front
 relimS: maybe I can try that
 BlaiseEbuth: Aldoggen still here?
 Westicles: What room is this in pidgin?  I connected to general but didn't work
 relimS: the new-chat.codingame.com uses wss protocol
 BlaiseEbuth: world
 Westicles: aha
 jacek: Automaton2000 when will you shut down
 Automaton2000: lets see how it does
 jacek: oh my  ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 jacek: Automaton2000 :taco:
 Automaton2000: i would really like to see the game
 Illedan: xD
 Aldoggen: yo BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: o/
 relimS: am I still online?
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 jacek: nyoro~n
 relimS: anyone here?
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 relimS: looking at the code, I don't think they are permanently taking the chat feature
 relimS: down*
 jacek: they will&#160;:(, it was announced. it was supposed to be removed in mid june
 relimS: I don't get why the chat server is still up though
 jacek: :shrug:
 dwarfie: because webchat is not the chat ... just a front-end . chat server is an xmpp server (like ejabberd or prosody)
 relimS: theoretically, someone can just write a tempermonkey and eject some css code
 dwarfie: they said they shut down web chat ...
 relimS: I would probably able to eject it if I can read all the diff
 jacek: the point is newcomers will not see any chat
 Wishbone: Why are we still seeing it then?
 jacek: only old chat addicts know how to connect to it
 Westicles: It is a sad day.  I loved telling 12 year olds they are too dumb to program
 BlaiseEbuth: OMG. Dat dumb discord will be integrated on CG :scream:
 therealbeef: where did you read that?
 BlaiseEbuth: cm post on forum
 darkhorse64: it's not a commitment, though
 BlaiseEbuth: No. But initialy it was a 'no' so...
 therealbeef: I already wondered why they said they had to 'invest' in maintaining the chat. Can't you just buy some solution off the shelf? Webchats is not a new problem I assume
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 relimS: They probably are not
 relimS: what's hard about maintaining chat?
 Dapps: oh wow i still have chat open in an old browser tab
 therealbeef: Apparently the chat was made by an intern and not so great quality and it' hard to maintain
 relimS: Can't you open source it on github and rely on the community to help?
 BlaiseEbuth: Which community? The one they try to kill?
 relimS: they are trying to kill the community?
 relimS: I am new so I don't know any history
 therealbeef: Many ppl feel that the community is the greatest part of CG (compared to other coding sites), and the chat is the cornerstone of the community
 Dapps: this ^
 relimS: am I still online?
 BlaiseEbuth: no
 relimS: I just change the password because I need A password for  pidgin
 relimS: testy testy
 relimS: anyone still here?
 BlaiseEbuth: no
 Westicles: 639 people in room
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Westicles, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 114 tacos
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] That's a bot.  Bots don't eat tacos
 Automaton2000: not that it matters that much
 Bob_Rocks: Automaton2000 why does it not matter
 Automaton2000: game 90 has a winner
 Bob_Rocks: automaton2000 what do you mean by game 90
 Automaton2000: i was not able to understand it
 Bob_Rocks: Me neither

 jacek: interesting indeed
 j4at: rip chat&#160;:(
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey j4at, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 12 tacos
 jacek: eat :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 Aldoggen: :p
 j4at: "a direct integration on CG to show activity"
 j4at: Will they have clashes chat tho?
 jacek: who cares about clashes ~
 Aldoggen: I do
 j4at: me too&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: in that case I'll invite you :p
 Aldoggen: have fun
 Aldoggen: wow that clash was annoying
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/032/874/cover4.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/032/874/cover4.jpg</a>
 Aldoggen: XD
 Aldoggen: let's just say it took me over 100 characters in python
 jacek: and java beated you?
 Aldoggen: nope, 
 Aldoggen: I beat him by 6 characters
 j4at: He used regex
 j4at: i don't know regex
 Aldoggen: j4at do you remember why you stopped the slice at s.rfind(b)+1 (instead of s.rfind(b))?
 jacek: the beginning reminds me of something <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoZUjxstIZs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoZUjxstIZs</a>
 Aldoggen: what beginning?
 Aldoggen: dammit I did it. I reloaded the page on one of the tabs I have CG opened
 j4at: Aldoggen it adds numbers only after it finds a non digit character that's why I added +1
 Aldoggen: aah, all right&#160;:)
 j4at: If I used regex I could have gotten sub 100. Could have googled it but didn't want to&#160;;)
 Aldoggen: nice solution tho&#160;:)
 j4at: ty&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I'm trying to set up this pidgin thing so I can keep using the chat if I eventually accidentally reload the last tab that has chat
 Aldoggen: know anything about that?
 Aldoggen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/feature-update-chat-rework/1556/20">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/feature-update-chat-rework/1556/20</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not complicated
 Aldoggen: yep, but I'm getting stuck getting my user Id
 Aldoggen: they tell you to look at the FAQ
 Aldoggen: don't find it there. 
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah faq changed
 Aldoggen: is it the one in the url when you look at your profile?
 BlaiseEbuth: The last 7 digits in reversed order
 BlaiseEbuth: (no joke)
 Aldoggen: ah lmao
 Aldoggen: and I think I somehow never had to fill out a password, and now I can't change it
 Aldoggen: like either I would have used a default one or put it in my pw manager. 
 Aldoggen: default one doesn't work
 BlaiseEbuth: Didn't you registered with another account like google or other&#160;?
 Aldoggen: I kinda want to try to log out, to check
 Aldoggen: but I might lose all tabs that way
 Aldoggen: ah, different browser
 Aldoggen: I used github apparently
 jacek: is it pronounced jithub
 Aldoggen: that doesn't change its spelling&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: So you should be able to use the 'i forgot my password' to set one
 Aldoggen: all right
 Aldoggen: edge is already getting on my nerves lmao
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Aldoggen: all right. cg succesfully detected I didn't have a password yet and just let me make one after me making them send an email to my mail address
 Aldoggen: that feels very unsafe
 Aldoggen: but whatever
 Aldoggen: pretty standard practice i guess
 Aldoggen: thanks for the help BlaiseEbuth&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 Aldoggen: I connected to general. didn't seem to work, though westicles was there at some point. it should probably be world then. no?
 BlaiseEbuth: yup
 jacek: try friends #fr
 Aldoggen: I don't know what they're saying half the time jacek
 Aldoggen: okay it works now. amazing :D
 Aldoggen: the emoticons are jarring though
 Aldoggen: 
 jacek: :oncoming_police_car:

 Illedan: gn

 Automaton2000: but i didnt know about the great purge
 Illedan: Automaton2000 what are your plans for the after chat life?
 Automaton2000: Illedan is fluttershy a tree?
 Illedan: Automaton2000 no
 Automaton2000: i just created a new list
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 seems to be a bit confused
 Automaton2000: nice to see more 'cross-pollination' for want of a better way
 Aldoggen: gn jacek
 Westicles: where do you go on discord to beg for contrib approvals?
 Darleanow: i might approve it depending on the wut it is&#160;:)
 Westicles: oh, I just meant generically
 Darleanow: tbh idk
 Darleanow: try spamming in every channel&#160;? x)
 Westicles: oh, they broke contrib comments.  whoops
 dianissimo_z: follow me guys!
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 Darleanow: #follow4follow channel pls 
 Westicles: turns out the intern coded the whole site
 Darleanow: they're crazy boys
 Darleanow: this is so annoying
 Darleanow: how am i unable to solve simple puzzles
 Darleanow: with cpp
 Westicles: which one?
 Darleanow: longuest sequence of 1's
 Darleanow: i guess the problem is when i'm pushing the 1's strings
 Darleanow: because they're int, to a string vector
 Westicles: well, once you solve it you can view my beautiful solution with 2-space indents
 Darleanow: disgusting.
 Darleanow: c)
 HenroLST: CHAT STILL ALIVE WOOHOO

 struct: nice rank eulerscheZahl
 miszu: I have been running my code offline for 32 min and can only find a score of 11k for the horde scenario
 miszu: 111k
 miszu: *
 struct: I think my code was taking under 2 minutes to find the 400k+
 miszu: bruuh
 struct: maybe increase the search time localy?
 struct: instead of using 150ms use 1 sec per turn?
 miszu: what you mean?
 struct: idk
 miszu: I simply repeat random moves
 struct: from the first turn?
 miszu: yeah
 struct: that wont do it I think
 struct: my code doesnt find the 400k in the first turn
 miszu: ok so after running X seconds you take the best move, you move in then restart?
 struct: i play the move and keep searching
 struct: until game ends
 struct: I dont know if I run it for seconds
 struct: I cant remember
 miszu: ok fair enough
 miszu: I will do that approach
 miszu: going to sleep now. Good night everyone
 struct: gn
 eulerscheZahl: thanks struct
 eulerscheZahl: but my last improvement gives wrong answer&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: fixed it. just not sure if the extra time cost is worth it
 eulerscheZahl: yes, was worth it
 jacek: :tada:
 Aipiox: Hi everyone!
 jacek: good morning
 aCat: hi
 xiaohaooll: Hi
 Aliloulaye: What is the purpose of this chat&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: chatting
 AntiSquid: random rush league promotion in crystal rush \o/
 Cyber_Loki: Hi dudes
 Falkern: whats upp
 Cyber_Loki: can you help me
 Cyber_Loki: anyone
 KyoHyper: oh no
 jacek: oO
 jacek: stupid tanh. target = 1, prediction = -1. and i was wondering why no learning occurs
 dreadylein: :D
 eulerscheZahl: stupid codeforces. gives WRONG_ANSWER but no clue what's wrong
 alexey4eg: user power of the brain
 dreadylein: i guess the answer is wrong :P
 MSmits: I think dreadylein is on to something
 barbora: you can get WRONG_ANSWER if you output 0 paths, though not sure if that is your case
 Ran_42: Why is there no way to add new code golf?
 JFB: jacek - what game?
 MSmits: don't know actually, but my thought after doing code golf was never: "I wish there was more of this". Could just be me though&#160;:)
 Ran_42: xd
 Ran_42: Actually i would like if there would be more :p
 MSmits: yeah tastes differ. At least the is clash shortest. 
 MSmits: there
 Ran_42: ye well I hope they would add more code golfs outside of clashes
 MSmits: i guess the system only allows optims and multis right now
 MSmits: as contributions
 Ran_42: ye I guess only cg can add golfs
 MSmits: you could ask for it on the forum, if a lot of people would request it, they might consider
 MSmits: but i doubt there is enough support
 MSmits: they're very busy with their escape thingy
 MSmits: some optims are code golf-like
 MSmits: as in the output needs to be golfed
 Ran_42: which ones are those?
 MSmits: I can think of 3
 MSmits: sec
 Ran_42: sure
 MSmits: CFunge, Bender 4 and code of the rings
 MSmits: the code itself is not golfed though, just the output. But the output is like a program
 Ran_42: I see I will check those out
 MSmits: not sure if it appeals to you, but it's something
 Ran_42: thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: any time
 _NikJ: Has anyone tried using the parameter fiddler with UTTT? It keeps throwing errors for me after 6th game
 Cyber_Loki: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/HCm-wdb-rrP-v0B">https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/HCm-wdb-rrP-v0B</a>
 struct: maybe the fiddler doesnt support the uttt referee
 struct: it was made when brutaltester was in version 0.2(?)
 _NikJ: well it does say that it's a supported referee
 eulerscheZahl: did you use the official UTTT referee or a modified version that can be run from the command line?
 eulerscheZahl: official won't work. never did for any game
 jacek: whats parameter fiddler
 _NikJ: I used the one linked on the github of the fiddler
 _NikJ: Under "List of compatible referees"
 MSmits: for UTTT I recommend you write your own tool. It's such a simple game that it's better to do it yourself.
 MSmits: it's good practice.
 struct: yeah but they are compatible with brutaltester 1.0
 struct: not compatible with brutaltester 0.2
 _NikJ: I have the latest 1.0 version struct
 struct: yeah the fiddler wont work
 _NikJ: So I might as well write my own? :D Or is there a way to make this one work
 struct: Just write your own I guess
 struct: Usually I just send the move the other player made
 eulerscheZahl: write a vanilla MCTS, then you don't have to tune parameters
 struct: and if the player that is gonna move has found a win i send WIN
 struct: and the referee will know who won
 eulerscheZahl: also UTTT might be a really bad game for self-play parameter tweaking, as there are just 2 different initial boards
 struct: yeap
 struct: I agree with euler
 MSmits: why is that a problem?
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: the game diverges a little later, but it does diverge
 _NikJ: I wanted to try and modify my C constant in UCB1
 _NikJ: Just for fun, see if it works any better
 MSmits: when you backpropagate, is -1 a loss, 0 a draw and 1 a win?
 MSmits: or do you use 0, 0.5 and 1?
 _NikJ: 0-1
 _NikJ: range
 MSmits: then your exploration parameter should be around 0.5
 _NikJ: 0.45 at the moment
 MSmits: then it won't improve much
 _NikJ: The "sweetest' spot I've found so far
 MSmits: yeah that corresponds with 0.9 in my case and between 0.9 and 1.1 it plateaus
 _NikJ: ah, you use -1,1 range?
 MSmits: yes, i don't like fractions
 MSmits: and it's symmetric
 _NikJ: True, I like the symmetry part
 MSmits: in practice it should hardly matter
 TheBlueBias: Plateaus can go up according to french politicians...
 MSmits: I don't listen to any politicians 
 MSmits: they only repeat what people with brains say or tell you what you want to hear. I listen to the brains&#160;:)
 TheBlueBias: Well, not sure this one had any brains available...
 MSmits: not necessary for his line of work
 MSmits: not these days anyways
 Fedor_Emelianenko: sup guys
 MSmits: :point_up:
 MSmits: that way
 Fedor_Emelianenko: yes
 Fedor_Emelianenko: )
 MSmits: There is also :point_down: which is down
 TheBlueBias: :thinking:
 MSmits: I am filling in for jacek btw
 TheBlueBias: Is it really required?&#160;:/
 MSmits: probably not
 TheBlueBias: :3
 jacek: :upside_down:
 TheBlueBias: (╯°□°)╯︵&#160;:)
 mask-007: Which interface do you play games on?
 MSmits: i don't understand the question
 MSmits: my bots play games and use input and output. I don't play games
 MSmits: my motto is: Why a play a game when you can code a bot to do it.
 _NikJ: Aww, it's a coding escape? Now I'm sad
 TheBlueBias: Welcome in our reality _NikJ...&#160;:(
 Einwickler: Wow, I was gone for over a year and yet it's the same usual suspects in here. Nice to see! :grin:
 TheBlueBias: People are strange...
 Astrobytes: hello Jim
 Einwickler: Haha reference to my avatar intended?
 TheBlueBias: :door:
 TheBlueBias: +s
 Einwickler: :blush::ok_hand:
 TheBlueBias: Hello Franck o/
 MaxTi: o/
 TheBlueBias: \o
 jacek: smits, have you checked out nine men's morris
 TheBlueBias: eulerscheZahl are you here?:persevere:
 TheBlueBias: On ICPC do you consider "temporality"? I mean when a flow is sent on the network, is it on an edge, then on the next one, etc. Or Everywhere on its path&#160;?
 gavi: Hi!I cannot find anymore a competition in which there are 3 monsters in a square grid. each has to reach one border of the grid. They can move or place an obstacle. What puzzle is that, please?
 TheBlueBias: The Great Escape.
 gavi: yes, that one. Thank you, @TheBlueBias
 TheBlueBias: :thumbsup:
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 TKZI_Knowledge_Commander: I'm keep craching my PC just by beefup the speed to max speed
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: struct here?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: this works right:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc2f3f68-e767-4a35-957f-5cb27f96d6b4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc2f3f68-e767-4a35-957f-5cb27f96d6b4</a>
 MSmits: i got this from you a while ago
 MSmits: adapted it a bit, but still your function
 MSmits: should be called random move btw
 struct: Should work
 struct: its similar
 MSmits: kk, i am changing my bot not to save the state on the node
 MSmits: also implementing TT
 struct: they should help
 struct: I just dont know how to implement it with MCTS
 MSmits: you store the childindex and childcount in your hashtable
 MSmits: so when you expand, you assign the index and count you already have
 MSmits: parents will share the same set of children
 eulerscheZahl: TheBlueBias 05:00PMeulerscheZahl are you here?:persevere:
 MSmits: it messes with mcts statistics, so it's not perfect
 struct: I think I understand the rules
 eulerscheZahl: i understand them
 struct: its always a bit cryptic
 eulerscheZahl: at the last Huawei marathon it took me more than 1 hour to understand the task
 eulerscheZahl: this one was a bit easier. the only tricky thing was:
 eulerscheZahl: It's guaranteed that only multiple edges may share the same GroupID.
 MSmits: was it in Chinese euler?
 eulerscheZahl: no, English only. Not even a Russian version available
 struct: i always find it easier to read the inputs
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: and understand the problem from there
 eulerscheZahl: "multiple edges" is multi-edges. 1 reserved expression
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_edges">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_edges</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but now I'm confident that I understood everything. Last time I even went back to reading the statement on the last day
 MSmits: that happens in dots and boxes
 MSmits: if you make a graph
 eulerscheZahl: 1st Smits axiom: no matter what you are talking about, it can detail to dots &amp; boxes
 eulerscheZahl: oh nice, i'm 3rd \o/
 struct: wow
 eulerscheZahl: still more than 50% to go
 jacek: this is how you prove NP-complete problems: to make them into other NP-complete problems
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 jacek: in this case its smits-complete, when it is convertible to d&amp;b
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: you guys are well versed in smits-theory
 TheBlueBias: So it's just about comprehension, everything's in the statement,
 TheBlueBias:&#160;?
 struct: if i want to more test cases for cf, do I need to make my own?
 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i still only have that 1 alibi testcase
 TheBlueBias: Meh. Don't see anything about that in the statement...
 TheBlueBias: So I'll just consider omnipresent flows I guess...
 eulerscheZahl: then i didn't understand your question it seems. each flow is blocking the whole path
 eulerscheZahl: i thought you were asking about my internal representation
 jrke: eulerscheZalh nice rank in ICPC!
 TheBlueBias: No of course. I was asking if the flows "moves" on the network.
 TheBlueBias: So no. Thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: thanks jrke. but still way too early. tourist is also lurking. last time he was way behind and then submitted straight to 2nd place
 jrke: i am also looking in contest currently just trying for few flows to reach target
 Ryzev: Hiu
 Ryzev: Hi
 MACKEYTH: ICPC?

 jacek: pspspsps
 _NikJ: Ah, Gennady is insane
 jacek: hm?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Can I do this using map instead with Python?list=[int(i,16) for i in list]list=[*map(int...?
 TheBlueBias: Did tou test it?
 TimothyAlexisVass: map only take 2 arguments...
 secantsquared: You can do that, just make sure to pass a lambda or reference to a defined function first, then the iterable that is being mapped over... and the * will then unpack the map object into a list
 jacek: :snake:
 TimothyAlexisVass: OK
 TheBlueBias: :eagle:
 TimothyAlexisVass: That's what I thought. Thank you&#160;:)
 Uljahn: guess you can create a partial function

 Manjius: :angry:
 VeljkoZ: Hi guys
 VeljkoZ: What is u exp of finding job here
 AguliRojo: I don't expect to find job using this or any other site.
 AguliRojo: Experience matters more, and that can be achieved by projects.
 bt05:&#160;: )
 Manjius: u need both
 Manjius: or only this
 Manjius: tbh projects is the least important
 Dren: that depends a lot on the job
 Manjius: yeah true
 Manjius: im here because i failed technicals after my projects got me interviews :joy:
 Aderner: im preparing to technicals too :D 
 Aderner: Junior lvl *
 Manjius: good luck

 Wontonimo: ^^ for Hyperplane
 Hyperplane: :joy:
 Thorcode: nice ascill
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode :wave:
 Thorcode: hi
 Thorcode: could you help me to understand this DEFIBRILLATORS easy&#160;?
 Wontonimo: sure
 Wontonimo: what do you want help with?
 Thorcode: the distance what does it do?
 Thorcode: sometimes some puzzle make my brain boom
 Wontonimo: you need to calculate the distance between the user location and the defibrillators
 Wontonimo: then return the closest defibrillator
 Wontonimo: here is my defib class in python for it
 Wontonimo: class Defib: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c72f7629-46c1-419f-a2a0-5ec961556f1f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c72f7629-46c1-419f-a2a0-5ec961556f1f</a>
 Wontonimo: the equation for the calculation is in the problem description
 Wontonimo: it is just a literal implementation of it
 Wontonimo: the 'toRadians' function reads in the French formatted degrees,
 Wontonimo: replaces the "," with a "."
 Wontonimo: converts that into a float
 Wontonimo: then converts that into radians
 Thorcode: oh ok
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a1c21989-c996-4468-b95b-4c1b9f04c237">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a1c21989-c996-4468-b95b-4c1b9f04c237</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ pseudo code for the problem
 Thorcode: thanks Wontonimo
 zakacat: How do I find the problem of the week&gt;
 zakacat: I saw it before I left, and now I wanna try it
 5922: You can probably find it in your notifications in the top right
 zakacat: ohh yaaah
 zakacat: ty
 5922: np
 Wontonimo: 5922 check your notifications
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry, i was multitasking.  didn't realize zakacat asked the question and 5922 answered it already lol
 zakacat: no worries
 Wontonimo: a huge hint is the name of the puzzle
 Wontonimo: good night all
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Thorcode: Good night to you

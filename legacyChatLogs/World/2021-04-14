 Astrobytes: nice, how often do you check it? 3 times a year? :P
 Astrobytes: (on account of the slowwww games)
 BlaiseEbuth: This site look so 2010.

 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. You can play with a bot&#160;?
 VizGhar: That's one ugly page :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm not sure if you can matchmake yourself or not

 ZarthaxX: *cries in silence*
 struct: Did you also join codejam ZarthaxX?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that number was an exact match for me too
 ZarthaxX: struct ye solved one that round
 ZarthaxX: then became lazy and left the round lol
 jrke: what is codejam btw i mean which type of contest?
 ZarthaxX: competitve programming
 ZarthaxX: the classic one, codeforces like

 ZarthaxX: solve problems in X time
 jrke: oh
 ZarthaxX: these rounds are 2:30 hs and 3 problems

 Smelty: 3 years done, 2 years to go
 jrke: yes
 jrke: astrobytes you pushed me miles in CSB 
 jrke: from 33rd to 15th lol
 Astrobytes: yeah, don't worry, you'll go back down
 eulerscheZahl: how did you get that high?!
 Astrobytes: I've been CSBing since last night
 eulerscheZahl: i meant jrke
 struct: What search do you use?
 Astrobytes: I am curious though, you were 30-something? What algorithm are you using jrke?
 jrke: i am not sure what was that cause wrote it months back 
 jrke: but as far as i know its simulation + ga + good eval
 Astrobytes: Well, I'm fairly sure you'd remember
 jrke: not 100% but yes it was that
 eulerscheZahl: i still remember some details of my bot when others ask me about it years after. but i don't feel like typing that out and just link my forum post when possible :P
 struct: I also know all my bots by hearth 
 Astrobytes: Why didn't you use that CSB framework for SLCC jrke? It only needed minimal modification
 eulerscheZahl: by heart is a bit exaggerated for me. but the basic ideas at least
 Smelty: hmm
 Astrobytes: I'm fairly sure struct can recite his AVX ones by heart :P
 Astrobytes: (line by line :D )
 struct: Now im working on the new version
 struct: Where its "8x faster", not "8x simultaneous games"
 jrke: for slcc my reason for not using CSB framework was to just train myself to code faster and also for debugging experience cause when i joined only 3days was left
 struct: It has way more benefits
 jrke: but still i ended 26th not bad though
 ZarthaxX: not really 8xfaster tho
 struct: even if its 2x faster is wroth
 struct: worth*
 Astrobytes: Yeah I joined late too jrke, wish I joined earluer
 ZarthaxX: yeeee
 Astrobytes: *earlier
 Astrobytes: struct yeah, any speedup is a good thing
 Scarfield: eulier
 struct: For example it will be easier to use it with smitsi
 struct: The 8 pods at the same time is kinda bad for smitsi
 Smelty: my angle calcs are off for some reason
 Astrobytes: Seems it could possibly be worse if I think about it
 struct: it should be worse
 Astrobytes: Speed is what you need there
 jrke: astrobytes whats your algo for CSB atm
 Astrobytes: The same GA I've had for a few years lol
 Puru299792458: in question "The labrinth" do we need to have the knowledge of A*&#160;?
 struct: you should try smitsi
 Astrobytes: Every now and then I tweak parameters and fix bugs
 Astrobytes: Yeah I intend to soon struct
 jrke: i will CSB only when i learn ML-&gt;RL
 Astrobytes: The Labyrinth is just a BFS is it not? I can't remember
 Puru299792458: yup it is 
 Puru299792458: in external resources a* is mentioned 
 Puru299792458: so thought it will be reqd
 Scarfield: no need for a* on that one, but can be used
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I mean you could use it, I think its overkill
 Astrobytes: If you just wanna practice A* then go right ahead
 Westicles: Wow, Tbali is up to 491 puzzles solved.  Got to be close to all of them
 Astrobytes: impressive!
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I almost missed the opportunity - A*field
 Westicles: No space maze, freecell, or nurikabe
 Astrobytes: Ah, I'm sure he's able to do those
 Puru299792458: thanks astrobytes and scarfield, i think it will be good to know A*, after solving with bfs will try with A* 
 Astrobytes: There are a few more puzzles you can try A* with, just have a search
 Puru299792458: oh okay.
 struct: Also make sure to prune some moves when you do smitsi
 Scarfield: just did bender 2, recursion hurts my brain A*bytes
 struct: its way more efficient that way
 Astrobytes: Yes, makes sense struct
 Astrobytes: yo-yoing from 14th-16th to 43rd-51st in CSB. Just not consistent enough.
 Astrobytes: It'll probably finish 60th or something lol
 struct: too little points between those ranks
 Astrobytes: I know, I've been trying to break through the barrier but I think it's not going to happen with my GA
 struct: ok using avx on mcts might be benefitial
 struct: on the select phase
 Astrobytes: I thought you tried it before and it wasn't?
 struct: Never managed to do it
 struct: But now I have avx function to return the highest value
 Astrobytes: Oh this was the rather cryptic conversation yesterday 
 ZarthaxX: haha cryptic

 struct: I never saw c++ code like that tbh
 ZarthaxX: i told him an option but he prefers weird ass sutff :rofl:
 Astrobytes: It's a completely different world
 Astrobytes: lol ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: No pain, no gain eh!
 struct: Avx is fun
 struct: but is also painful 
 Scarfield: im gonna start putting the same disclaimer in the top of my code
 ZarthaxX: why painful
 ZarthaxX: it's just fun
 struct: painful at the start ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: In the same vein:Cats are small.But not as small as spiders.
 struct: Is too much stuff at once
 struct: You need to wire your brain so you can understand it
 Astrobytes: And go slowly into the void
 ZarthaxX: well yes
 ZarthaxX: i had a subject in uni about SIMD anyway
 ZarthaxX: intel asm and simd 
 ZarthaxX: so i guess it's way easier haha
 Astrobytes: oooOOOooo
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: My first class was about simd
 Westicles: Looks like if I did all puzzles I'd be up to 502.  I guess the number depends on how many deleted ones you've done
 ZarthaxX: looks struct, i dont intend that you understand anything
 ZarthaxX: but this asm has that thing i shared the other day

 ZarthaxX: no :rofl:
 Mr.Pepper: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: and AVX512 is dope
 ZarthaxX: but i wont show that one
 ZarthaxX: not useful for now anyway
 struct: I dont have a cpu that supports it
 Astrobytes: at least I can follow the asm a bit 
 ZarthaxX: hard to have one
 Westicles: I've got one, but not sure how much of the instruction set it has compared to what struct is using
 struct: My cpu is pretty old
 ZarthaxX: avx512 has these kind of things struct <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/kugelblitz1235/TPOrga_Final/blob/master/src/Smith_Waterman/SW_AVX512.asm#L303">https://github.com/kugelblitz1235/TPOrga_Final/blob/master/src/Smith_Waterman/SW_AVX512.asm#L303</a>

 ZarthaxX: or AVX
 struct: he has 512 support
 struct: he has a good cpu
 ZarthaxX: damn
 struct: xtreme
 ZarthaxX: holy f
 ZarthaxX: i had to use an emulator for these things

 ZarthaxX: it's amazing but painful as struct said lol
 ZarthaxX: once you get how evertyhing works it's crazy
 Astrobytes: The braces tho
 ZarthaxX: oh toad has avx too
 ZarthaxX: im the only one without avx :D
 ZarthaxX: braces are amazing haha
 Astrobytes: I am getting into avx stuff, just slowly
 ZarthaxX: and have an avx cpu?
 Astrobytes: yes lol
 Astrobytes: not 512
 ZarthaxX: i know
 ZarthaxX: just checking im the poor one ah
 struct: By the time I finish CSB cg will have 512
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know if they are in Azure or AWS
 eulerscheZahl: there are contradicting statements
 eulerscheZahl: i only know that they use AWS to send emails
 Astrobytes: OVHcloud too, for what exactly I'm unsure
 Westicles: CG doesn't use their own HW?  Then why does it grind to a halt every night?
 Qyxi: Morning.
 struct: They changed db or something
 struct: and since that change it gets laggy every day
 struct: at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: i thought they just recompute the global leaderboard
 struct: Yeah, but it didnt use to lag before
 ZarthaxX: same
 eulerscheZahl: and somehow have a too high priority for this task so the rest just ends in a queue and has to wait
 eulerscheZahl: hm, no idea. I sleep at that time
 jacek: those clashes need to be computed after all
 eulerscheZahl: join my sleep cycle struct, then CG is fast for you too
 Astrobytes: Old Man Euler is recruiting others :o
 struct: I rarely use IDE so it doesnt bother much

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/320/">https://xkcd.com/320/</a>
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: i totally forgot the "your mom" part of the story line
 Astrobytes: It works well in the context
 Qyxi: A char is 8 bits, but isn't overly easy to work with numerically. Is there an easy way to create a 8 bit type that can store be made for storing numbers 0-255 unsigned or -128 to 127 signed?
 Qyxi: and/or between store and be made*
 Westicles: The real-world mom part is she has no idea when to call, you might be asleep any time of the day
 jacek: Qyxi but it is easy. int8_t is char basically. it is different only for printing
 Qyxi: I see. Forgive my ignorance. I failed college c++ in 1998 when I was in college. Failed to see how that was important for engineering/business at the time.
 Astrobytes: and uint8_t for unsigned
 Scarfield: to print the value on int8_t you could simply do cerr &lt;&lt; 0+var
 Qyxi: When you say, "is char basically" you mean that it's an 8 bit int with mathematical operators rather than requiring single character inputs yes?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/f74LrSh.png">https://i.imgur.com/f74LrSh.png</a>
 struct: its the same
 Qyxi: This is embarrassing, I should have known that. I've seen typedef in windows code using that format on vars many times. Thank you for being kind with a constructive answer.
 Marchete: unsigned long long shot a bit larger than x;
 Marchete: glad they added formal typedefs
 Qyxi: Oh, looking at the link. the int8_t is still a char.
 Astrobytes: they're both integer types
 Astrobytes: char and int8_t
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1725855/uint8-t-vs-unsigned-char">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1725855/uint8-t-vs-unsigned-char</a>
 Qyxi: But, char x = 50; throws a compiler error.
 Marchete: unless you are going to do code to different systems, or going to do low level programming
 Marchete: (i.e. OS kernels, drivers, etc)
 Marchete: don't spend time on that
 Astrobytes: Something else must have caused your compiler error.char x = 50 most definitely compiles.
 Qyxi: Well, I'm thinking about memory constraints. And I have no idea how to do bit manipulation.. it eludes me. Using variables of &gt; 8 bits is a waste of memory when I know that the min/max values will fit within the constraints of 8 bits. 
 struct: Barely recognized marchet with that avatar
 Astrobytes: lol
 Qyxi: I'd considering a  native array type if I could wrap my thoughts around bit wrangling.
 Astrobytes: you can use std::bitset if you want to mess around with bits and aren't too comfortable 
 Marchete: indeed
 jacek: also try :notebook: :soccer:
 Astrobytes: Other than that: why are you concerned about memory usage righ now?
 Astrobytes: *right
 LelouchVC2: Unless you're coding something that needs a lot of ram, optimizing ram is like saving a drop of the ocean
 LelouchVC2: optimizing ram usage*
 Qyxi: Well, I'll give you an example of where it needs thinking like this. 7 days to die USED to run on my 12 gb ram laptop when it was alpha 16. Ran like a dream. Now, since programmers maintain the notion that memory is cheap.. it runs my laptop hot at a whopping 8 frames per second.
 Astrobytes: Well yes, but I mean in your specific use case
 jacek: you paid for 12gb ram, then use 12gb ram. no money wasted [solved]
 Marchete: add more ram, problem solved
 Astrobytes: *download more ram ofc
 Scarfield: xD
 Marchete: jacek, I'm askew as well
 jacek: but not round
 Qyxi: And, that's something I'd prefer to avoid. Currently, running NEAT using floats everywhere where many can be 8 bits, I can greatly increase active entities with limbs and brains.
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: hm, case for vectorization?
 Marchete: is there any benefit on reusing MCTS for the next turn on CG?
 Marchete: given the constraints
 Astrobytes: reusing the tree from the best node?
 Astrobytes: Sure
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: what&#160;% do you gain?
 Qyxi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b00af1f3-b803-42b9-9352-1f4b1d20b1d1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b00af1f3-b803-42b9-9352-1f4b1d20b1d1</a>
 Marchete: if you have 10 moves, the enemy 10 moves
 Marchete: so you reuse only 1/100 of all the previous search
 Marchete: no?
 Qyxi: Why'd that make a link?
 Astrobytes: Think it's game dependant gain-wise Marchete, jacek probably has a statistic for it
 Marchete: you need a premium account
 Scarfield: message length &gt; some limit
 Astrobytes: lel
 Qyxi: Oh. Good to know.
 struct: marchet it wont really be 1/100
 struct: because you will choose probably the most expanded node
 struct: so will opponent
 Scarfield: its would be more than 1/100 since the MCTS should have guided you towards the more visited nodes
 Astrobytes: ^
 Marchete: ok, then I'll continue tweaking my code to reuse it
 struct: do you use mcts solver marchet?
 Marchete: no
 jacek: its better for low branching games of course
 jacek: must have for oware
 jacek: or bandas
 Marchete: but I'm trying to implement jacekmax on oware
 Marchete: that doesn't have that
 Marchete: or at least not on your playground
 jacek: jacekmax has implied solver o.O
 Marchete: implied
 Marchete: I'm doing jacekmax but I'm trying to tweak my precache nodes to allow tree reuse
 jacek: part of eval is if win = +inf, if lose = -inf
 Marchete: it comes mainly from smitsimax, that can't reuse much of the tree
 jacek: and negamax backpropagation would know that
 Marchete: if that's the MCTS solver, then yes
 Westicles: Huh.  All that *max talk is real?  I thought you guys were joking
 Astrobytes: cegimax is the fake one
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 Marchete: smitsimax and jacekmax are real :D
 Marchete: negamax I'm not that sure
 Astrobytes: :P
 Scarfield: Bielefeldmax&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: Nonexistimax
 Scarfield: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: What's so funny Astromax&#160;?

 BlaiseEbuth: JacekTS
 Astrobytes: you're on form tonight HumourField
 BlaiseEbuth: But form of what...
 Astrobytes: on form, not *in* form
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: also not in shape, but a shape
 BlaiseEbuth: Less fun un english
 BlaiseEbuth: *in
 Astrobytes: true
 Astrobytes: afk a few mins
 BlaiseEbuth: *a few max
 Scarfield: sigh xD
 struct: ZarthaxX here?
 struct: I need his expertise
 BlaiseEbuth: ZarthaMax
 Astrobytes: I have returned.
 struct: The bigger a mcts tree is the slower it is right?
 TheBigE: bruh moment
 Scarfield: i guess you introduce bigger possibilty of cache misses with greater size, but idk
 Astrobytes: It'll be bigger in memory for sure but you should be cutting off huge parts of it anyway
 struct: well the tree fit entirely in cache before
 struct: its a small test
 TheBigE: what if you put the tree in a box to mail to the cache
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 TheBigE: :upside_down:
 ChunkyStyleMilk: monke
 jacek: bigger tree, shorter games
 Astrobytes: I could understand putting cash in a box and mailing it to your nearest branch.
 TheBigE: what if you put the box in another box so you can fit it in the mail box for the tree
 ChunkyStyleMilk: monke
 Astrobytes: Quit your crap memes ChunkyStyleMilk
 Astrobytes: You go figure that out TheBigE
 TheBigE: ok thank you

 Astrobytes: CrazyWarrior
 Astrobytes: hi Codermritunjay
 Codermritunjay: where are you from
 Astrobytes: Hover your mouse over our profile pictures
 jacek: is scotland still part of great britain?
 Astrobytes: For the moment.
 Astrobytes: Not for long I suspect/hope.
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Well, UK
 Astrobytes: Also hoping for Irish reunification and the Welsh to stick up for themselves too.
 TheBigE: wa'er
 Astrobytes: Do something useful TheBigE
 TheBigE: like what
 Astrobytes: Bot programming, puzzle solving, optimisation... you know, all the things on the website 
 TheBigE: ok fiiine
 TheBigE: i just got bored
 jacek: have you missed anything, Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Ah, Code golf, thanks jacek
 jacek: and the other C
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: :smirk_cat:
 TheBigE: i am actucly pretty good at golf IRL
 Marchete: no that's forbidden
 Astrobytes: I do not advocate the Big C
 ChunkyStyleMilk: TheBigE*
 Astrobytes: I can live with big o, big omega and big theta but I will never advocate the Big C on CG
 ChunkyStyleMilk: What about big alpha??
 Astrobytes: ...
 ThornFlynt: is there anyway to sort python courses by difficulty or just keep doing recommended?
 ChunkyStyleMilk: or big delta
 TheBigE: how about the big D
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid will help you with the D
 Astrobytes: Perhaps he can ease you into using the D
 ChunkyStyleMilk: what the crap is antisquid 
 Astrobytes: Keeper of the D
 Astrobytes: If you wanna talk crap you'll get crap back.
 Astrobytes: ThornFlynt: you mean puzzles?
 TheBigE: well good thing i don't crap
 Astrobytes: ThornFlynt: was that your post on discord? What difficulty level would you like?
 ThornFlynt: Thank you!
 Astrobytes: no worries&#160;:)
 ThornFlynt: I just found the FAQ in the forums and was reading through that x'D
 ThornFlynt: But basically I'm looking to up my scripting game... I've done simple bash, batch, powershell... but discovered codingame and needed a good path to learning Python through more hands-on application than some incredibly boring lecture

 ChunkyStyleMilk: oh snap
 ChunkyStyleMilk: cute dog
 Astrobytes: stnwtr: use #clash channel to post clash links please!
 stnwtr: sorry
 Astrobytes: no worries
 stnwtr:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You can still ask in here, just mention that the link is in #clash channel
 Astrobytes: ThornFlynt: yeah CG is good for practicing new languages on for sure
 Marchete: good practices, you should see my bot code
 Marchete: so clean and beautiful
 Astrobytes: Good for practicing, not good practices! Stroustrup would have heart failure if he saw my C++ on here
 benismad: xd
 karimk123: wassup
 jacek: AntiSquid congratz on chess advance, you -2.29
 karimk123: im spooderman
 TheCoding: sup g
 Astrobytes: Ah you know, hanging with the homies, sipping on lean, munching bars and programming ill bots. The usual.
 TheCoding: fr
 TheCoding: the usual
 karimk123: fr
 Astrobytes: #fr
 karimk123: sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
 Smelty: #fr
 didoddos: k
 Westicles: purple drank?
 Astrobytes: ma sizzurp, ma lean ma draaank
 Astrobytes: (I am of course kidding)
 karimk123: red sus
 Astrobytes: The only truthful statement was "programming ill bots". They certainly act unwell anyway.
 Westicles: A little cough syrup might be good for that cold though
 areze: hi
 test9999999: test
 Astrobytes: Stopped taking cough syrup years ago, pretty useless unless you have a chesty cough, usually indicative of a chest infection, therefore not really cough-medicine territory. For tickly dry coughs, honey &amp; lemon is fine
 Therabidpanther: cough syrup is literally heavenly 
 TheCoding: boring
 TheCoding: anyone got a code for loop
 Therabidpanther: oh wait, we talking about purple drank rn lol
 TheCoding: lol
 TheCoding: he the best tbh
 LelouchVC2: I literally have cough syrup just for when im trying to sleep
 TheCoding: that sucks
 LelouchVC2: I've had the same bottle for over a year now
 TheCoding: sheeeeesh
 TheCoding: \
 Therabidpanther: i just use a weighted blanked for sleep lol
 Astrobytes: Cough syrup abuse is not common in the UK
 TheCoding: ye same
 TheCoding: makes sence
 LelouchVC2: nice
 Therabidpanther: i mean, idk how common it even is around here lol
 TheCoding: were u from 
 Therabidpanther: or wait, is sleep aid considered abuse?
 Therabidpanther: lol
 TheCoding: lol
 LelouchVC2: I doubt teenagers are abusing cough syrup when drugs are literally around every corner
 TheCoding: i dont think so
 TheCoding: fr
 Astrobytes: Easier in the US because the allowed excipients (and quantities thereof) are quite different for OTC meds
 TheCoding: i mean u could get drugs off a homeless man now a days
 Astrobytes: OTC cough meds
 TheCoding: im pretty sure in la weed is alowd 
 TheCoding: allowed 
 Therabidpanther: weed is allowed in quite a few places now
 Astrobytes: Smoking weed is not quite the same as synthetic opiods and DXM
 TheCoding: i forgot why there making it allowed
 TheCoding: ye not the same but eh its somthing tbh
 Astrobytes: I am not advocating either
 TheCoding: so what yall doing right now
 Therabidpanther: thinking about what to do
 Astrobytes: Failing with my bots.
 TheCoding: ye that sucks
 TheCoding: what wrong with the bots
 Astrobytes: Have you tried the Bot Programming section yet TheCoding?
 TheCoding: ye
 Astrobytes: And?
 TheCoding: failed
 Astrobytes: At?
 TheCoding: the coding
 Astrobytes: ...
 Therabidpanther: the easiest part
 Busting: yep
 Busting: i dont know how but i did
 Astrobytes: Therabidpanther: What kind of games do you prefer?
 Astrobytes: In terms of bot programming
 Busting: bytes when did u join this 
 Astrobytes: uh 2015 I think, but wasn't really 'active' until 2018 iirc
 Therabidpanther: I have only really done that first pod racer one
 Busting: have u gotten good at this thx to the progaming 
 Astrobytes: Therabidpanther: Did you like it? There are a few more physics-based games besides that one. If you prefer other stuff there are grid-based (either maze or board games) and other types of board game variants
 Busting: ooh i like mazes
 Therabidpanther: it was pretty cool
 Astrobytes: Also, don't forget to try to reach Legend league in it
 Therabidpanther: that sounds tough lol
 Astrobytes: You can get to gold with simple heuristics
 Astrobytes: And even legend with a little more maths
 Astrobytes: Or you can write a search algorithm
 Busting: thats cool
 Busting: Astrobytes has this game help u on ut coding
 Busting: ur*
 RyanGilbert: been awhile since ive done a clash
 Astrobytes: TheCoding: Most stuff I do on here helps me with my coding/understanding of certain algorithms
 Busting: clash are hard when ur facing good players
 Busting: Astrobytes thats nice
 Astrobytes: The rest of the site &gt; clash. Clash is for when you want a short challenge when you're on a brek or something.
 Astrobytes: (imo)
 Busting: oh makes sence
 Astrobytes: *break
 Westicles: The only fun thing about clash is making contributions
 Astrobytes: lol, I wouldn't dare. Haven't done enough to be able to approve one :D
 Busting: how could u lvl up
 Astrobytes: I do look at them however, just to punish myself a little when I feel CG is doing well
 Westicles: It is fun trying to make one where generating validators needs complicated code
 Westicles: But the clash itself is easy
 Astrobytes: That I can understand, yeah
 Busting: easy for u guys u guys alr have the most experience 
 Astrobytes: The most experience out of which particular pool of users? I'm not even a dev.
 Busting: u dont gotta be a dev to know much about coding tbh
 Westicles: Huh.  Apparently I submitted default code to Crystal Rush a month ago, and just now it made it to bronze
 Astrobytes: Was that from the starter Westicles?
 Busting: is that a good thing 
 Busting: or a bad thing
 Westicles: Yeah, whatever the default is.  Looks like a loop of five WAITs
 Busting: .
 Astrobytes: heh, not surprising.
 Busting: fr
 Astrobytes: #fr
 Busting: #sheesh
 Busting: so this basically like discord 
 Astrobytes: no it's completely different. It's an XMPP chat
 Astrobytes: It's not connected to the CG discord
 Busting: pftttt ye i knew thst
 Busting: that*
 Astrobytes: Then you would not have asked if it was basically like discord
 Busting: i just wanted to see if ur answer
 Astrobytes: If my answer what?
 Busting: i just wanted to see ur answer
 Astrobytes: Why
 Busting: curiosity 
 Astrobytes: It killed the cat you know
 Busting: what cat
 Astrobytes: Curiosity killed the cat.
 Busting: sad\
 Busting: #sadboihours
 Astrobytes: If you are unfamiliar with the expression I suggest you look it up.
 Busting: ohhhh
 Busting: ye makes sence
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't feed Astroll
 Busting: y
 Busting: man schools boring asf
 Astrobytes: Don't listen to Beelzébuth there, he's trying to trick you.
 Busting: i trust him more now 
 Astrobytes: Hey, it's your soul, idc
 Busting: well i do
 Busting: he seems like a nice guy to start off
 Astrobytes: Do you think he likes you?
 Busting: idk does he
 Astrobytes: What do YOU think
 Busting: IDK he prolly does
 BlaiseEbuth: 'f course I do
 Astrobytes: Hm. Vanity, definitely my favourite sin
 Busting: U SEE
 BlaiseEbuth: :smiling_imp:
 Busting: ebuth we bff 
 Astrobytes: blaise, how about some of that left-hand magick for my little csb bot here
 Busting: no
 Busting: say no
 Mr.Pepper: one validator failed for puzzle the Fastest ( Medium) 
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, guess we can find an agreement...
 Busting: how  do u guys get mod
 Astrobytes: Selling our souls to Blaise usually
 Busting: good enough
 Mr.Pepper: :rofl:
 Busting: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Who needs a soul these days anyway...
 Busting: honesty i would do it tbh
 Astrobytes: Just to be a mod?
 Busting: ebuth u seem like the guy who wants sum souls
 Busting: ye mod seems fun
 Busting: could i gte admin
 Astrobytes: He can definitely add all the souls he has, yes
 Busting: he prolly has 40 ]
 Astrobytes: No. And mod isn't fun.
 Busting: well ur mod y isnt mod fun what is it that u hate
 Astrobytes: Unless you're Blaise, who claims every kicked soul
 Westicles: Oh no, they got Louis.!
 Busting: oh dam
 Westicles: He lasted like 3 weeks this time, wonder what happened
 Busting: sheesh
 Busting: i gtg alr
 Astrobytes: You, Mr Westicles, are THE most massive troll on here, and yet I struggle to hate
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 BlaiseEbuth: Louis. was robin&#160;? Seemed different :thinking:
 Westicles: Thanks&#160;:)  I'm pretty benign this last year or so
 Astrobytes: Honestly, it's impressive
 BlaiseEbuth: What?
 Astrobytes: The Truth costs 3.5 souls Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh.
 BlaiseEbuth: You're far above the price... Lie is a much better investment.
 Astrobytes: Eh, fair enough.
 Astrobytes: When I look at my code for Tulips v Daisies I see my eval and always think to myself "You've got The Flower! Evaluate!"
 Project-Magenta: totoro
 Astrobytes: If you don't get that btw you need to re-educate yaself on 90s eurodance classics
 LelouchVC2: I think I'll die looking that up
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh 90s are so 20th century...
 Astrobytes: Nah. Snap - Exterminate and You've got the Power
 Astrobytes: (I've got the Power? maybe)
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no user named anasplit on the site...&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Hm, 49/940 on CSB
 Astrobytes: that's almost a nicely palindromic 049/940
 BlaiseEbuth: 0,0516332982086406743940990516333
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: So literal
 Astrobytes: 049 940
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I hate this fking game
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop playing it
 Smelty: o.O
 BlaiseEbuth: #bettetCallBlaise
 Astrobytes: Never. I'm an astro and astro's don't run.
 Astrobytes: Or possibly #betterCallBlaise
 BlaiseEbuth: [CG]Typo
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out, cya tomorrow :D
 Smelty: #betterCallBlaise

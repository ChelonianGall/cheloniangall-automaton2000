 Tiramon: hm can't ban people that are not online&#160;:(
 KamadoTanjiro: hi
 derjack: good morning
 Dark_Hack: hi
 Vanta_Black: hehehe boyiii
 KovanTrober: Greetings from Czechia&#160;;-)
 struct: hi
 KiwiTae: o/
 martinpapa69:&#160;:/
 struct: i think we had the same reaction
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 struct: oh well i beat the default
 struct: at least i have a sim for this if i dont include spells
 YusufEmad04: helloooooooooo
 Illedan: struct, it is 100&#160;% FB?
 struct: yes but you only have 1 spell
 Illedan: of, new spell
 struct: new and only
 KiwiTae: u got a NN ready for this? 
 struct: no
 struct:  I just had fb sim that I never used
 struct: all i did was copy paste
 struct: since my sim did not have spells
 struct: :D
 Illedan: lol
 struct: I guess this is a easy victory for pb4
 struct: robo also has a bot&#160;:(
 RoboStac: yeah, but it's only 46th on the fb leaderboard
 struct: yeah this one is like 400th gold I think
 martinpapa69: does your code compile&#160;?
 struct: I was trying to make smistimax for it
 RoboStac: I had to disable spells, but no other changes
 struct: but gave up on it
 struct: yeah you only have to disable spells
 martinpapa69: i get some exotic messages for my old code
 martinpapa69: CS1024: Preprocessor directive expected
 RoboStac: do you have the wrong language selected?
 martinpapa69: yup :D
 MSmits: happens to me all the time
 struct: i probably cant write the spell without referee
 MSmits: you dont have a referee?
 Illedan: This force seems instant
 martinpapa69: no idea how to feed this many entities to NN... convnet with a layer for each entity type i guess&#160;?
 Illedan: should be easy
 MSmits: martinpapa69 time to appeal to re curse
 struct: its like apply thrust?
 MSmits: I think he did a nn for this
 MSmits: not sure he finished it
 martinpapa69: he's not the guy who likes to share many details :D
 MSmits: not many, true
 MSmits: but some
 struct: maybe I need to change my algo
 struct: since smitsimax failed for me on fb
 MSmits: it's not easy to implement there
 MSmits: people use GA too
 Illedan: This code is smitsimax 
 struct: i dont know ga though
 struct: maybe ill need to learn
 struct: yes Illedan
 MSmits: pb 4 uses GA
 dbdr: Illedan you have smitsimax in sogesti?
 struct: I do dbdr
 struct: since its a failed fb test
 MSmits: sogeti
 dbdr: doing worse than my 5 lines of python? :thinking:
 Illedan: I have dbdr
 Illedan: but it sucks
 Illedan: I'll rewrite to SGA in a few days
 Marchete: GA? welcome to 2015
 MSmits: whats the S again?
 dbdr: strange it fails so badly
 Illedan: I think my eval is very bad
 Illedan: And I think the combining of the scores for my wizards are bad
 MSmits: dbdr the hard part is that in some states you can have the ball (sniffle?) and some not and it's the same node
 MSmits: so different  moves available, same node
 MSmits: hard to deal with
 Illedan: S = Simultaneous
 RoboStac: mines still a ga, I thought I'd tried smitsi but theres no sign of it in my history
 MSmits: in csb for example, all moves are always the same
 MSmits: so if the state is a lot different, you can still use the same node
 MSmits: pcr also, mostly. Works in br2k too
 MSmits: you can instead keep different sets of statistics on a node for two movement sets
 MSmits: but I dunno
 dbdr: it's so strange, these contests with advanced bots submitted in the first minutes :D
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I'm not even going to try going up against ex-contest bots
 Illedan: I need Legend in FB anyway, so I might give it a go
 MSmits: ah yeah thats a good point
 MSmits: I guess it could give me some easy cp
 TreborKovan: MSmits - Why? Take it as fun&#160;;-)
 MSmits: this type of game is less fun to me
 Illedan: No bitboarding? :D 
 MSmits: still working on dots and boxes
 MSmits: well... mostly that it's a physics game and hard to search
 dbdr: and Snake is not out...
 Illedan: I have to do Snake first.
 Illedan: If someone just accepted my non visualizer :eyes:
 Illedan: xD
 dbdr: with JS viewer, could you display every single move?
 Illedan: I think so
 struct: yes
 dbdr: wow
 derjack: so clobber nearly tripled players during potw
 derjack: and new pots isnt multiplayer&#160;:(
 struct: join the contest
 struct: apply your NN
 Malek_BOUFAHJA: hello&#160;:)
 Malek_BOUFAHJA: i'm in
 MSmits: pots?
 dbdr: puzzle of the semaine
 KiwiTae: baguette week 
 KiwiTae: :grin:
 Marchete: :french_bread:
 MSmits: ohh ok
 AsteelPoro: Hi guys, did someone try the potw&#160;?
 Tiramon: why?
 AsteelPoro: i'm blocked and i was searching for some advices 
 Tiramon: hm puzzle of the week has a missing 'wrong output' it dos not mention 'starting square is empty'
 AntiSquid: AsteelPoro blocked from what? i see you in chat lol
 Marchete: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: what happened
 Marchete: crashes crashes crashes
 struct: where
 Marchete: everywhere!
 MSmits: yeah you crashed me to rank 2 :P
 Marchete: :S
 MSmits: working on that solver now
 MSmits: and then i need to figure out what to do with my nim sacrifices that lose me games vs you
 MSmits: this game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572256651">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572256651</a>
 MSmits: my first sacrifice is obviously a bad idea and cost me the game
 MSmits: however
 Marchete: add more ifs
 MSmits: why did you make the sacrifice
 MSmits: at frame 48
 MSmits: wait no its the other way around
 MSmits: *you* made the first!
 MSmits: why lol
 MSmits: it's not nim, but score solving is really hard at this point
 MSmits: so i am wondering how your bot gets to the decision of this risky move
 MSmits: do you mcts it? Play out to endgame,backprop your solved score?
 Marchete: it heuristics at first
 Marchete: and at some point minimax
 MSmits: sure, but that box cant have come from minimax can it?
 MSmits: can you really solve that early?
 Marchete: T:=
 Marchete: T:0
 Marchete: it's heuristic
 MSmits: so you heuristically give away  a box?
 MSmits: ballsy
 struct: if turn == 48 giveaway
 MSmits: his is actually at 43
 MSmits: so even worse
 MSmits: mine is at 48 and based on nim
 jrke: MS do in mid game or say before endgame do you make the board easy
 jrke: i mean like less chains and all
 MSmits: my current submit doesnt make the board easy, it tries to do the opposity
 MSmits: but i do it from turn 1
 MSmits: until turn 33
 MSmits: then switch to nim solving, because i need nim solving to beat everyone
 MSmits: apparently it only takes 1 player to make the board easy/loopy
 MSmits: even if the other player tries to stop it
 MSmits: i cant stop martinpapa69
 MSmits: err
 MSmits: Marchete
 jrke: i think before 3-4 turns of endgame you can do minimax and using solver value as evaluation
 dbdr: m&lt;tab&gt;
 Marchete: I try to do loops
 MSmits: yes and i try to stop it, but i fail
 Marchete: but before searchs or even nim
 Marchete: I try to count graph info
 derjack: man addicted to brake fluids claims he can stop anytime
 Marchete: and meanwhile I crash a loooot
 MSmits: jrke i was working on that
 MSmits: but even then, my nim solver causes me to sacrifice boxes, early solving might not save me
 jrke: i am not sure what is nim solving
 MSmits: it's solving but for control, not for score
 MSmits: so i try to be the one that plays the last safe move
 MSmits: so that the other guy needs to open a long chain or something
 MSmits: nim solving is wayyy faster
 MSmits: unfortunately, you oftne need to give away a box when you do it
 MSmits: and that puts you 1 behind on score
 MSmits: then when the endgame starts, Marchete kicks your ass
 jrke: Marchete did you made your solver?
 MSmits: i could switch to nimsolving without giving away boxes, but thats not true nim. I would lose more vs mikla
 MSmits: Marchete beating mikla with the same stick
 MSmits: changing the meta
 Marchete: I do fair against mikla too
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I like it
 Marchete: but I don't have 100% winrate vs lower ppl
 MSmits: I loved my score solver, but it was so useless before
 MSmits: now it's not
 MSmits: just gotta combine everything properly
 Marchete: because of me?
 MSmits: I'm sure you noticed you're helping jrke, as well Marchete
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: jrke has a good score solver
 MSmits: so making everything about score, helps him too
 Marchete: ahh, didn't know
 Marchete: what I knew is that he is deterministic
 MSmits: remi sucls at score, he's a nim guy
 MSmits: sucks
 Marchete: because I testbench some stuff
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i didnt check, but yeah some players are deterministic
 MSmits: remi is also. I had a cheesy way to beat him before i had a nim solver
 MSmits: I used seeded random and just tried different seeds until i always won :P
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: it's like a counterbook except it's 1 integer
 dbdr: strange that remi is deterministic. then it's not MCTS, or fixed number of sims?
 derjack: you could use that rng to initialize random nn and find which one is best
 dbdr: ^ genius
 derjack: remi uses... math
 derjack: maybe he thinks mcts is for noobs
 MSmits: yeah, good point dbdr, i also thought he had some kind of nim-mcts so math + mcts, but yeah that seems hard to combine with determinism
 MSmits: most players just random the early game
 MSmits: the only thing i found you can do is affect the general shape of the structures that come out, but not decide the game in your favor that way
 MSmits: using mcts i mean
 MSmits: aka, force the loopy board
 jrke: is there any way we can use heuristic to solve non-loony games
 jrke: like in which joints are there
 jrke: like chain running into a loop
 MSmits: chain running into loop is easily done heuristically 
 MSmits: always remove the chain first
 MSmits: before the loop that is
 MSmits: not necessarily before other chains
 MSmits: no easy heuristics for that decision unfortunately
 MSmits: for example, sometimes it's good to play a loop before a chain
 MSmits: but to get to this connected loop, you need to play the attached chain first
 MSmits: so then you'll do the attached chain before other chains
 MSmits: but if the attached chain is very long, it's a bad idea
 Marchete: 14 matches without a crash! a new record....
 MSmits: gj&#160;:)
 Marchete: :unamused:
 Marchete: 15th was a crash
 MSmits: thats how that goe 
 MSmits: s
 MSmits: did you not find the cause of crashes?
 Marchete: I find some
 MSmits: so you coded too much at once?
 Marchete: and that's why it crashes less
 MSmits: I thought i was the only one making the mistake of coding 500 lines and then doing the first test :P
 Marchete: yeah, I even do more
 Marchete: CGZero was like 2000+ lines without testing
 Marchete: or more
 jrke: i thought the same but not that 500 mine was 300-400
 Marchete: 4 loses, 3 crashes
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: 3 out of 4 losses are crashes
 MSmits: i wonder if these losses are would-be wins or not
 MSmits: when i beat you on the lb it's not a crash
 MSmits: oh right, those are heuristic
 MSmits: again with the sacrifice losses :P
 Marchete: I see
 Marchete: I'm heuristic
 Marchete: you can get the bot ID
 MSmits: good heuristics
 Marchete: and retry as much as you want
 MSmits: do you mean deterministic?
 Marchete: that
 MSmits: I kinda want a general solution, not a anti-marchete solution&#160;:)
 MSmits: but gj man
 MSmits: with a crashy bot now clear 3rd
 jrke: i am not sure how remi's bot is below me
 MSmits: because of Marchete
 MSmits: Marchete makes everything about score solving and remi cant do that very well
 MSmits: because he sacrifices a ton of boxes
 jrke: so its like record- `whenever MS steals 1st rank in D&amp;B another person comes to steal that`
 MSmits: I still don't understand how you determine when to sacrifice a box heuristically Marchete
 MSmits: are you keeping this a secret?
 MSmits: because maybe it works well
 MSmits: jrke yes&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh lol. We play the same game over and over Marchete
 Marchete: I'm removing the fixed rng
 Marchete: jrk_e keeps winning me now no matter the rng :S
 MSmits: as i said, good score solver&#160;:)
 Marchete: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Marchete: but I was able to win him before
 Marchete: I think he counters my counts
 MSmits: what counts?
 MSmits: you mean loopyness?
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: well it should not matter
 MSmits: he doesnt use nim
 MSmits: so loopyness doesnt hurt him
 MSmits: he just solves score like you
 MSmits: I'm thinking of making a clean bot, take all the nim stuff out, force loopy and just solve asap
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/Marchete">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/Marchete</a>
 Marchete: :D
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: nim peasants
 MSmits: it's funny that nim turns out to be useless
 Astrobytes: "nim peasants" :D
 Marchete: well, not against the 99.99% of other players
 Marchete: I mean you did 100% vs everyone else
 MSmits: they dont sacrifice boxes
 MSmits: thats all
 MSmits: it's an extreme form of RPS
 Marchete: sacrifices backfire
 Marchete: and you know it
 Marchete: so it's a hard balance
 MSmits: sacrifice + nim &gt; simple score solver bot
 Marchete: it seems I got destroyed by jrk_e right now
 MSmits: sacrifice + nim &lt; score solver bot + loopy
 Marchete: no crashing but all losses
 MSmits: you could push him to `1
 MSmits: that'd be cool
 MSmits: do it, make a screenshot and imgur it for him
 Marchete: it's an idea
 Marchete: a bad one, but an idea
 MSmits: I like it :P
 Astrobytes: So cruel
 Marchete: gotta go
 MSmits: ttyl, i'll try to make that other bot in the mean time
 Astrobytes: Stupid IDE play limit :rage:
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt;
 Illedan: :fire:
 derjack: what do you play so frequently
 Astrobytes: It varies
 Astrobytes: Today, the Soggy Challenge
 derjack: hm?
 Astrobytes: The Sogeti contest
 derjack: the FB one?
 Astrobytes: aye
 eulerscheZahl: any changes to fantastic bits?
 Marchete: how's the sogeti contest?
 RoboStac: only one spell and it's slightly modified 
 eulerscheZahl: what is the spell? (i didn't register so i can't see the statement)
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i could watch replays
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1704d58-af40-4a42-924c-fa22d71f0707">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1704d58-af40-4a42-924c-fa22d71f0707</a>
 KiwiTae: wingardium they called it
 phKvothe: WINGARDIUM id x y magic
 derjack: wingardium
 RoboStac: probably aren't a lot of replays with it in yet, I think most people have just submitted fb bots with magic disabled
 KiwiTae: top players use it already
 Marchete: is recurs_e playing?
 eulerscheZahl: astro is using it
 KiwiTae: only 20 people in the leaderboard so fae
 eulerscheZahl: reCurs e can't win according to the rules
 Marchete: or pb_4
 Marchete: to not even trying

 eulerscheZahl: i think i'll pass on this one
 eulerscheZahl: most of the very few contestants so far are CG regulars. probably not what organizers were hoping fro
 eulerscheZahl: for*
 Astrobytes: Maybe this will finally encourage me to write a sim for FB
 derjack: or sim for twitter
 eulerscheZahl: the private referee discouraged me
 struct: i probably wont join
 Marchete: private referee?
 eulerscheZahl: now we have the Magu s contest bot (minus the eval part)would that be considered cheating? :thinking:
 struct: Im gonna try to improve breakthrough
 MSmits: it's a bit silly, because the people from outside dont know they can just take the FB referee
 RoboStac: there isn't a public fb referee
 Astrobytes: magus bot?
 eulerscheZahl: GitC was the first contest where CG published referees

 MSmits: so that's unfair
 Marchete: anyways my bot was an evolved magu_s
 MSmits: to people outside, apart from the fact that there are some strong bots premade already
 MSmits: like a magus-mutant
 Astrobytes: oh, never spotted that before
 MSmits: x-magus
 MSmits: oops pinged :P
 Astrobytes: I did too&#160;:(
 MSmits: I did two
 eulerscheZahl: an original game costs time =&gt; money to make. I suppose sogeti didn't want to pay for that
 MSmits: yeah i wonder if they had the option to
 eulerscheZahl: and it's still good enough as it is to find potential applicants - that's probably the main objective
 MSmits: ye
 eulerscheZahl: not to find the most skilled coder and give them a laptop
 Marchete: everybody has a price
 Marchete: I code for food, with extra steps
 struct: should have been breakthrough
 struct:&#160;:(
 struct: at least my bot is a bit better
 Marchete: I was 3rd at FB
 Marchete: well FB multi ofc
 Astrobytes: struct you were 5th in breakthrough right? I thought you were "done" :smirk:
 struct: submit the bot without spells Marchete
 struct: Im done with eval
 struct: Im gonna try other stuff
 struct: I wont submit for a while probably
 MSmits: what happened to 2 more days
 struct: I dont know what else to play
 MSmits: plenty of choice&#160;:)
 struct: i could finish the nn book
 struct: yeah but Im still missing one thing on breakthrough
 struct: That I want to do
 eulerscheZahl: "should have been breakthrough"thibaud once mentioned something like CG not wanting to make money out of community contributions
 eulerscheZahl: there was a mean max variation has a contest once. but apart from that i think all their semi-private contests are based on official CG games (or completely unique)
 struct: I see
 eulerscheZahl: the mean max contest btw: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/contests/onepoint/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/contests/onepoint/global</a>

 AsteelPoro: Hey, does someone have a link to learn theory behind the potw
 AsteelPoro:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: what's the current puzzle of the week?
 eulerscheZahl: found it, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/map-colorations">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/map-colorations</a>
 JFB: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/clobber">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/clobber</a>?
 eulerscheZahl: that's so last-week JFB
 Astrobytes: :D
 JFB: ops 
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't done it. but i think i would bruteforce it (possibly combined with dynamic programming)
 eulerscheZahl: also assign colors in a certain order (e.g. first region is always color 0)
 eulerscheZahl: then count permutations of colors with math
 MSmits: sounds like the samegame trick
 MSmits: to hardcode the recoloured problems
 eulerscheZahl: do you think that comment will help AsteelPoro?&#160;;)
 AsteelPoro: Yeah, i'll search some example of algorithm to learn how to make it optimized enoug
 AsteelPoro: thanks for the answer
 AsteelPoro: First, I was thinking about using deletion-contraction but i'm not really sure about this
 eulerscheZahl: there is 1 value in the constraints that i'm missing: how many different regions can there me?
 eulerscheZahl: be*
 AsteelPoro: Max is less than 15
 AsteelPoro: but it can be asked to use 1000 colors
 eulerscheZahl: say you have 3 regions A,B,C
 eulerscheZahl: B is connected to both A and C
 eulerscheZahl: while A and C are not connected
 eulerscheZahl: A=&gt;0B=&gt;1c=&gt;[0,2]
 eulerscheZahl: these are your color assignments
 eulerscheZahl: so you have {0,1,0} and {0,1,2} as "base assignments"
 eulerscheZahl: when you want to extend it to 10 colors, you go through those base assignments
 eulerscheZahl: and substitute the colors
 eulerscheZahl: 0 can actually be {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
 eulerscheZahl: 1 can be anything but your substitute for 0
 eulerscheZahl: that's where combinatorics comes into play. you can count them with some multiplications, you don't have to enumerate all of them
 eulerscheZahl: look up "factorial" if you don't know it already
 AsteelPoro: i know about this 
 eulerscheZahl: great
 eulerscheZahl: so with some early pruning of invalid base assignments this should be fairly easy
 AsteelPoro: thanks for the explanation, the point blocking me is when for example i have two values that can be the same but with your explanation i start to understand
 AsteelPoro: in your example, A should also be [0,2] right&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: if you make A=2,B=1,C=0, it's a re-coloring of A=0,B=1,C=2
 AsteelPoro: yeah i thought about this after saying it
 jacek: :duck:
 MSmits: I use this channel for rubber ducking a lot. People don't even need to reply. I just ramble on until I see the solution
 MSmits: I could just open a irc channel and have a second account called rubber_duck and do it there
 Marchete: irc channel?
 MSmits: yeah for nostalgia reason
 ShakeDatBunda: hey guys
 ShakeDatBunda: I have a question
 ShakeDatBunda: how do i get 'Coding Speed' - Legend 
 ShakeDatBunda: in clash of code
 ShakeDatBunda: like do i have to win a certain number of fastest modes?
 ShakeDatBunda: or do I have to reduce my average time in all game modes or whaat&gt;
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to complete the clash branch of the quest map
 ShakeDatBunda: ohhhh

 oshock: Are you limited to a single file for the competition?
 ThomC99: yes
 oshock: ugh
 ThomC99: don't worry
 ThomC99: you can use multiple file on your computer and use tools to merge them
 ThomC99: and sync with CG extension
 oshock: I think I will just make my classes without public, private, or protected and they should be able to fit in one file (I am using java right now). The file is just going to be ugly lol.

 Astrobytes: yeah
 Astrobytes: FB with 1 spell (a new spell)
 MSmits: it's a company sponsored contest so they don't separately advertise fo rit
 MSmits: the advertising is done by the company
 FalINTOblivion0112: ohhh i see
 jrke: how you discover those contest astro?
 AllYourTrees: ahh i had no idea about that wow
 Astrobytes: I didn't, can't remember who did
 AllYourTrees: what is FB?
 Astrobytes: Fantastic Bits
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: is FB fun?
 AllYourTrees: i know its probably subjective, just want to hear thoughts
 Astrobytes: Yeah, really good game imo
 FalINTOblivion0112: i cant join because im in canada
 FalINTOblivion0112: f in the chat
 Astrobytes: F
 AllYourTrees: F
 Astrobytes: Change your location&#160;;)
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh okay i can do that
 FalINTOblivion0112: is it hard?
 Astrobytes: That's subjective.
 FalINTOblivion0112: im ai gold level
 Astrobytes: It's a physics game
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh
 FalINTOblivion0112: wow thats gonna be fun
 FalINTOblivion0112: physics is my favorite
 Astrobytes: Go for it&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 jrke: oh so my FB heuristic without any magic is running 11th
 Astrobytes: that's a legend bot though isn't it?
 jrke: yeah
 FalINTOblivion0112: ahhh its a quiddich game
 MiyamuraIzumi: I can't selece my country when register on sogeti2021
 FalINTOblivion0112: thats funzo
 jrke: but simple if else with few maths
 MiyamuraIzumi: does this mean I can't play in sogeti contest?
 Astrobytes: Yeah I only have if-else and some vector maths
 struct: meanwhile i have 2k lines&#160;:(
 TobiasA: what is sogeti
 TobiasA: i can't find it
 jrke: struct thats why you have better rank also

 struct: maybe  if  I change to random search it will do better
 Astrobytes: what is it?
 Astrobytes: currently I mean
 struct: mine is smitsimax failed implementation
 struct: That i tried on fb
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 struct: it got around bottom gold
 struct: But didnt use spells
 jrke: make it smitsimax success implementation
 FalINTOblivion0112: i cant code anything lol
 struct: My sim is terrible
 struct: I cant use this
 FalINTOblivion0112: i barely know how to make a moving bot lol
 FalINTOblivion0112: sometimes i get lucky and do things good like ultimate tic tac toe
 jrke: oh so WINGARDIUM is both accio and flipendo
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572322356">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572322356</a>
 jrke: lol
 jrke: last snaffle
 jrke: a random win
 struct: still not sure if ill play the game
 struct: If portugal was allowed i would try
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm just starting...
 IlyasDirham: who ever sees this add me as a friend il add back
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil:
 IlyasDirham: :eyes:
 Wontonimo: :door:  :runner:
 reCurse: No
 BlaiseEbuth: .
 jacek: :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°)╯︵&#160;:)
 Illedan: reCurse, how much for that FB bot you have? :D
 dbdr: 1 laptop
 struct: his bot was like top 5 wtihout spells 
 struct: in fb
 Illedan: dbdr, snake postponed 1 week. Gotta do this Contest thingy first. Unless someone else wanna fix UI :P
 dbdr: ok
 reCurse: Surprise me
 Illedan: I'll give you my Onboarding code
 reCurse: Was hoping for a positive surprise
 Illedan: Mean Max code? :P
 Illedan: Is that code NN?
 reCurse: NNo
 Marchete: pawn stars 
 Illedan: Hmm, so it is beatable
 Marchete: the best I can do is tree fiddy
 struct: beatable with a NN
 reCurse: Hmpf
 struct: vs 2022 going to have native wsl 2 toolset for c++ :D
 reCurse: Yeah 2022 is pretty good atm
 reCurse: Using it
 reCurse: Time bank management is puzzling me
 struct: for chess right?
 reCurse: Yeah though it's an open question in general
 struct: yeah, i have no idea how engines handle it tbh
 struct: have you checked how sf does it?
 reCurse: I'm not sure how helpful a minimax time management would be
 jacek: you do this for yourself or cg
 reCurse: For myself
 reCurse: Well maybe I'll post the engine on CCRL at some point if it's good enough
 reCurse: Right now I run a local arena with the few chess engines that still exist for download and seem to behave properly with 1sec/move
 reCurse: But eventually time control will become something to address
 jacek: afair a0 (or its clones?) used simple 5% of remaining time for turn
 reCurse: That offends me
 jacek: hm?
 reCurse: Disgusting :P
 reCurse: Guess I'll need a mcts-vis after all
 jacek: few years ago you wouldnt dare to use mcts for chess ~
 reCurse: Probably why it blundered mate in 5 in a totally winning position eh
 Illedan: Anyone did NN for FB? I wonder how you would handle 5 vs 7 snaffles :thinking:Like one hot encoding, just with floating positions?
 reCurse: The same way you'd handle a scored snaffle
 reCurse: Also I have good reasons to believe FB is a poor fit for NN
 reCurse: But take that as you will
 Illedan: Yeah, but in 5 snaffle games you only need to control 3 snaffles to win, instead of 4
 reCurse: Take into consideration current score and snaffles left and it's the exact same problem
 reCurse: Or if you prefer this wording, a 5 snaffle game is identical to a 7 snaffle game with 1-1 score
 Illedan: Oh, true. Thx!
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 reCurse: I need more cores...
 Illedan: Why do you think it is bad for FB btw?
 reCurse: Spells create a *LOT* of instability
 Illedan: This contest is far simpler
 reCurse: No idea didn't check
 Illedan: Only 1 spell
 reCurse: You only need 2 spells for instability
 reCurse: Or either one of them is already too much actually
 struct: spells are instant though
 reCurse:&#160;?
 struct: not sure if that changes anything
 struct: The spell doesnt have travel time like flipendo/accio
 struct: or just flipendo had I think
 Illedan: Yeah, the one spell is instant force towards a given target. Nothing else
 Illedan: Makes it far simpler
 reCurse: Ok maybe
 Illedan: But Jeff is without spells and 1st. So I'll try without spells
 reCurse: Anyway I didn't say bad it's just a poor fit in the sense you'll need even more work than usual to make it work IMO
 martinpapa69: Ill give a try to make an NN FB bot. not sure if i can make it in time
 Marchete: it seems complicated
 Marchete: and in that timeframe...
 reCurse: If you don't already have a base for that kind of game I'd say forget it unless you don't mind not finishing in time
 reCurse: Even with my current base I wouldn't attempt it
 Illedan: I have some ideas, which I can use for FB afterwards. So time is not to much of a problem
 martinpapa69: idc honestly. I do it for fun, maybe ill make a CSB bot instead, much simpler
 reCurse: SR is simplest for physics
 martinpapa69: sr?
 struct: search racer
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race</a>
 struct: I see that DomiKo got rank 27 on csb with his NN
 reCurse: CSB blocker a massive difficulty wall
 jacek: you could say its NN blocker eh
 AllYourTrees: N E U R A L N E T W O R T H
 AllYourTrees: so i was looking into buying a new personal laptop, just for some programming stuff, nothing fancy. but the ship date said end of september. think i should order it and just wait for 3 months, or just hold off?
 martinpapa69: SR is single player. I already have single player NN for CSB(double runner). I want to try a multiplayer now. but ye blocker is a problem
 struct: AllYourTrees there is always new stuff coming out
 struct: next intel cpus release on december iirc
 struct: not sure if you want to wait 6 months
 AllYourTrees: nah, its so i don't have to use my work laptop to program in my free time. trying to improve work/life split
 jacek: if i waited for the new stuff, id still be using 6 years old pc now
 AllYourTrees: i also don't need the fanciest fastest stuff
 reCurse: Just win the contest
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: Is it important in FB to try movements with less than 150 thrust?
 martinpapa69: you'll be fine with constant 150 thrust
 reCurse: Casual queen sac :o
 Illedan: And won?
 reCurse: Yeah not even close
 reCurse: I was surprised
 reCurse: Confident the whole way
 Illedan: Got some gifs to show it play?
 Illedan: :D
 jacek: queen got in the way anyway
 Astrobytes: was just gonna ask for that
 jacek: slowpoke
 reCurse: No idea how to gif a chess game
 Illedan: You have no visualizer?
 reCurse: Sure I use cute chess
 jacek: no pgn?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chess.com/gifs">https://www.chess.com/gifs</a>
 reCurse: Yeah I need to find the pgn
 struct: not sure if it works I never used it
 Astrobytes: didn't know that existed struct
 reCurse: Hmm lc0 seems to think the queen sac was a bad idea
 struct: neither did I
 struct: there seems to be quite some sites that do this
 reCurse: I only have a partial PGN I copied to clipboard before game end because I forgot to run this tournament without auto-pgn &gt;:(
 reCurse: Anyway
 jacek: for chess you can at least consult it with best engines
 reCurse: Yeah it's a plus but it's not great
 reCurse: Because they tend to view the slightest mistake as a catastrophe
 Astrobytes: trying to play more human-like?
 reCurse: No that's another project for later

 reCurse: Mine is black
 Astrobytes: That's a real deep rabbithole I think&#160;:)
 reCurse: I needed something to fill the void left by CG
 jacek: and white is?
 reCurse: Some random engine it's currently around 50% winrate against
 blasterpoard: can you post the bit of pgn that you have? lichess study would be a better way to share the game
 reCurse: Sure

 Astrobytes: Nice job man
 Illedan: Nice game yeah
 struct: oh no jacek
 struct: please dont submit

 struct: too late 
 jacek: welp, be faster
 struct: how much stronger was this version jacek?
 jacek: 56% winrate against old
 jacek: the same nn size and hyperparameters but trained differently
 jacek: but i think there is more room to improve for this capacity

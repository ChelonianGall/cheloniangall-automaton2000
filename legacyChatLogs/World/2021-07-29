 MSmits: I think it's electric
 derjack: from coal power plant
 MSmits: which is not in the chat
 derjack: :black_large_square:
 MSmits: is that supposed to be a coal powerplant?
 MSmits: don't pollute the chat derjack
 dbdr: this is the #World. coal plants are in it&#160;:(
 MSmits: mmh ok
 BlaiseEbuth: THE argument: "This is already polluted so we can pollute more."
 Illedan: Anyone knows anything about Colab vs local run of python? :P
 BlaiseEbuth: -&gt; python
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572886626">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572886626</a>I like that goal from the corner after frame 30
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't.
 dbdr: your loss
 MSmits: I like it
 BlaiseEbuth: :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: :grin:
 Illedan: Nvm, just had a bug. Now it works&#160;:)
 MSmits: :bug:  :fire:
 MSmits: my D&amp;B bot is now nearly 4k lines. I keep waiting for it to tell me it's too big
 Marchete: :eagle::bug::skull:
 Marchete: been there
 Marchete: you can remove a lot of stuff
 Marchete: spaces between operators
 BlaiseEbuth: Even if I know since a long time that 'nvm' stands for 'nevermind', it's still difficult for me to not read 'niquez vos mères'... :see_no_evil:
 Marchete: like = + &gt;
 Marchete: etc
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Marchete: will you submit, MSmits?
 Marchete: I'm interested in seeing your new bot
 MSmits: today
 MSmits: almost done
 Marchete: soon*
 MSmits: well almost done with a *working* version
 MSmits: will still have bugs probably
 Marchete: can it beat my ugly bot?
 MSmits: I think so
 MSmits: though probably not always
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: it still doesnt know what to do with your crazy loop offerings when the game is not solved
 dbdr: my sogeti bot is 18 lines:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/BfeZ1z.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/BfeZ1z.jpg</a>
 MSmits: of course it's never gonna grow big if you say it's pub time after every line
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: it reads like code written by an alcoholic
 BlaiseEbuth: Isn't it the case?
 MSmits: is pub a rust thing?
 dbdr: yeah. public
 MSmits: ohhhh
 dbdr: I will never read rust code the same way. thanks MSmits!&#160;;)
 MSmits: any time&#160;:)
 dbdr: I should submit a patch to use pub more there:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dusterherz/99BottlesOfBeer/blob/master/src/main.rs">https://github.com/dusterherz/99BottlesOfBeer/blob/master/src/main.rs</a>
 MSmits: yeah&#160;!
 MSmits: Marchete it is almost ready
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572894628">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572894628</a>
 MSmits: you can see it making a mistake around frame 83
 MSmits: the problem is, I use the solved value to determine which line to place or but not yet whether to keep control or not. so I am taking that full chain in the top left instead of keeping control
 MSmits: after than the score drops
 MSmits: that
 MSmits: your weird bot leaves safe moves till very late in the game, so i kinda need to make the pre-endgame solver perfect
 MSmits: (G5R and G4R are still up by then)
 Marchete:&#160;:)
 Marchete: so you are countering my weirdness
 MSmits: with the pre-endgame solver yes, but i dont use it for all types of moves yet, fixing that soon
 Marchete: it's looking good
 MSmits: i am afraid it wont help all that much vs mikla though
 MSmits: the games i lose are almost all by wide margins, it will just let me win the close ones
 MSmits: vs you, all games are close ones
 MSmits: all games i lose anyways
 Marchete: I don't know, I'm seeing epic losses in my bot
 Marchete: like -6 boxes
 Marchete: it should be 24 25 almost always
 MSmits: thats actually not that big of a difference
 MSmits: vs mikla in my case it's usually 11-38 or some such
 MSmits: or 38-11 in my favor
 MSmits: (40% of the time)
 MSmits: i dont succeed at the loopy map all that well, so it's mostly nim-fight
 Marchete: wow
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572895617">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572895617</a>
 MSmits: this is typical
 Marchete: I thought top games were always like 24 25
 MSmits: check how the solver makes my score better when mikla makes mistakes
 MSmits: see also why it does not matter *at all* that it does
 MSmits: here's another one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572895818">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572895818</a>
 MSmits: starts at 31-18 when solved
 MSmits: is upgraded to 35-14 due to mistakes
 MSmits: total nim-win, score doesn't matter at all
 MSmits: I have a bit of a problem here
 MSmits: the nim thingwrecks almost everyone except you, because you're mostly immune and mikla, because he's better at it
 MSmits: as soon as i stop using the nim and focus on making loopy maps more, i stop getting 100% vs all the nim-vulnerable out there
 MSmits: so i fixed it mostly vs you, because my score solver is now better, so i can afford sacrificing a box or two. but still not vs mikla. All i can do is submit and hope someone pushes me above him
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: I tried to mix with nim
 Marchete: at some cases
 Marchete: when complexity is breaking my search
 Marchete: but my strategy works very well vs mikla for example
 MSmits: yes
 Marchete: and jrk_e is 50/50
 MSmits: he has no clue how to play out the endgame other than heuristically and heuristics dont work when someone uses an unexpected strategy
 MSmits: he just gets into the endgame with an extreme advantage every time so it doesnt matter
 Marchete: so you see preemptive as a winning strategy?
 MSmits: in some cases yes
 Marchete: or more like kamikaze/unexpected?
 MSmits: ok, there's 2 ways to look at it
 Marchete: because if i win just because it's unepected and not optimal
 Marchete: it's a dead end
 MSmits: do you mean from a solved score perspective or from a beating mikla perspective?
 MSmits: the one assumes perfect opponent
 MSmits: the other assumes mikla
 Marchete: but I've read about these preemptive, and tried to apply them
 Marchete: about searching a perfect play
 MSmits: pre-emptive sacrifices are not a dead end really. They have real use, but only in specific ways
 MSmits: first of all you need to be ahead in score
 MSmits: so length -1 points ahead
 MSmits: if you're sacrificing a 3 chain, you need to be 2 points ahead
 MSmits: and it needs to be a non-isolated chain (i call this a string)
 MSmits: because you can never have a net win from the boxes left, when you do a pre-emptive sacrifice
 MSmits: but you  might not need one
 MSmits: because you have a lead in score
 MSmits: not doing the pre-emptive might get you -10, doing the pre-emptive might get you -2
 Marchete: I think I never have score advantage in preempitve
 MSmits: if you're 3 ahead, then 3-2 = 1
 Marchete: I mean, most of you never let 1 box until endgame
 Marchete: so I'll never sacrifice
 MSmits: mikla does
 MSmits: so does remi
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572897105">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572897105</a>
 MSmits: typical remi-game
 MSmits: see all the sprinkled sacrifices
 Marchete: but mikla and you?
 MSmits: bah i also see another solver bug in this game
 MSmits: mikla and you, yes sacrifices, but small ones
 MSmits: usually 3 max, mostly 1 or 2
 MSmits: but dont forget the other advantage
 MSmits: even if it will not get you a net-win
 MSmits: you invite the opponent to make more mistakes
 MSmits: so say you're at 0 0 score
 MSmits: and you will get -10 without sacrifice
 MSmits: -2 with  pre-emptive sacrifice
 MSmits: you cant win
 MSmits: but this assumes perfect play by opponent
 MSmits: so still a good idea to pre-emptive sacrifice here
 MSmits: especially if he doesnt know what to do with it and is always just gonna control like mikla does (take 1, give 2)
 MSmits: oh crap i see it, my solver ignores that 2 box chain at the top left :P
 derjack: oO
 Marchete: that's fine
 MSmits: I don't want my solver to give a score and then give a lower score later, that implies failure&#160;:(
 MSmits: must be fixed
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hi struct
 Marchete: :wave:
 Wontonimo: easy fix MSmits, use max(this score, previous score)so easy&#160;;)
 MSmits: it'd be a lie, the final gamescore will be lower :P
 Wontonimo: i'm jokin man
 MSmits: I know :P
 Marchete: if "2-box chain at top right" then ....
 Marchete: ezpz
 Marchete: solved
 MSmits: yeah I am not sure if that was the reason. Might need to go back to my local solver, see whats what
 MSmits: well thats not smart... I was returning 0 on timeout, to stop my solver, which is fine. But then don't store that 0 in a transposition table :P
 MSmits: I am using 3 different negamax in my bot. Keep making the same mistakes
 MSmits: ver = ver ^= box
 MSmits: that doesn't look right
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: isn't that the same asver ^= box; ver = ver;
 dbdr: i.e. the second one is useless but harmless
 MSmits: not sure, isn't it the same as ver = 1?
 MSmits: ver ^= box returns true doesn't it?
 dbdr: that'sver = ver ^ box;
 MSmits: that's what it was supposed to do
 dbdr: oh, and returns the new value
 struct: ver = (ver = (ver ^ box))
 MSmits: that returns 1 afaik
 MSmits: ver = 1
 dbdr: it returns ver ^ box
 dbdr: (their previous values)
 MSmits: isn't an assignment a boolean operation?
 MSmits: or
 dbdr: no
 MSmits: i mean doesnt it return true?
 MSmits: if(a = b) do x
 MSmits: always does x
 ZarthaxX: returns a reference to the value you assigned
 dbdr: a = (b = "foo")
 ZarthaxX: the variable*
 dbdr: a is now equal to "foo"
 MSmits: ahh o
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: I get it now. I guess it wasn't hurting me, it just looked silly
 ZarthaxX: that's why it comes in handy to do things like return a = 3
 ZarthaxX: assigns 3 to a, returns a, and that returns 3
 MSmits: that seems really dangerous coding to me :P
 ZarthaxX: yeah would be more of a lazyness thing
 ZarthaxX: codegolfing? :P
 RoboStac: it's undefined behaviour to have the two assignments to the same variable in one expression
 dbdr: if (a = true) // what can go wrong? :D
 struct: holy
 struct: my bot solved on turn 23 with my new feature from breakthrough
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572905465">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572905465</a>
 MSmits: what feature is that struct?
 struct: its a feature i added for mcts
 MSmits: mcts solver?
 struct: no
 MSmits: well that's cool. Not sure how much it helps though, C4 is a bit weird with solving. Some games solve soon. It also ended at 49
 derjack: pattern feature?
 struct: no jacek
 struct: basicly i was doing rollout if it was a forced move
 struct: instead of expanding
 MSmits: you can do another thing btw
 MSmits: if there is only 1 child
 MSmits: dont rollout
 Krios: how to change difficulty in clash of code
 MSmits: just keep expanding
 MSmits: until you hit a node with more than 1 child
 struct: oh right
 struct: I might try that
 MSmits: its a bit messy though, probably will bug for a bit
 KiwiTae: Krios theres only 1 difficulty for CoC&#160;: very easy
 MSmits: I do this in oware and C4 i think
 derjack: 1 child is rare on other games though
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats why it's usually a pointless if statement
 struct: but on c4 when are forced moves it might help
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it will bias your search a little bit, but this can be good or bad, hard to say, probably doesn't matter much
 MSmits: mmh i know why my score solver was wrong
 struct: what was wrong?
 MSmits: I was only allowing pre-emptive sacrifices for unfinished chains, but they also work in complex objects
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572901763">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572901763</a>
 MSmits: he opens a connected chain at frame 58
 MSmits: i assume that's always worse
 MSmits: but it's not
 MSmits: so my score drops from 40-9 to 35-14
 struct: so its a prediction
 struct: its not fully solved
 StepBack13: Anyone know the name of the CoC challenge that's about submarines in a grid and you count the number of your ships they can hit? Statement mentions Nazi enigma machine, but searching for all relevants words in below link comes up blank...
 MSmits: well hopefully if i include these options it will be a fully solved situation

 Geiler: We just did a Coding Clash and I don't understand the solution so I want to ask him lol
 Geiler: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: some clashers are bots. for obvious reasons they won't respond to you
 Geiler: rip no one was found in the chat
 Geiler: no one who could solve it
 eulerscheZahl: you can try the forum. a private message there will trigger an email notification
 eulerscheZahl: or you paste the solution and ask us to explain it
 Geiler: Sure, thank you, someone shared his code but I don't know Ruby, so can someone help me please?
 Geiler: s = gets.chompputs s.sum(99)
 Geiler: What does this do?
 Geiler: The input is a string and it should output a number
 eulerscheZahl: gets.chomps reads the line (without line terminator)
 eulerscheZahl: the 99 puzzles me
 Geiler: Same, I can imagine the sum function counts all the letters of the string s?
 Geiler: But I don't know why he put a 99 as arg
 eulerscheZahl: what was the task btw?
 eulerscheZahl: 99 is a lower-case c in ASCII, not sure if that's relevant here
 eulerscheZahl: ruby is a blind spot for me
 Geiler: Reverse engineering: an example was: Input: "an exemple" Output: 959

 Geiler: Wow, you own a search website
 Geiler: Thanks
 Illedan: It will replace google in a few years
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: all while still using the heroku free hosting
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: where is my number shifting app?
 Geiler: You can host a website on heroku for free?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Illedan: Think it is below this pile of training data for my nn
 Geiler: So you don't have to pay for anything?
 Astrobytes: that's what free means
 eulerscheZahl: but you can't keep it up 24/7. but 60% uptime is possible (it will suspend after 30min without any access and then start again when needed)
 Geiler: Lol I thought you also had to do other stuff than hosting
 eulerscheZahl: and the database has some limitations too (e.g. 10k lines at most)
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, I have that for my own todo app. Made a script to poke it every few min :P
 Geiler: I haven't made a website yet, but heard people saying they pay like 10$ every month
 eulerscheZahl: jrke used heroku for hosting. and some free cronjob site to keep it up
 Flaaamort: You are scraping the contributions while they are in review? :O Is this accepted?! 
 eulerscheZahl: you can get some things for free but there are limits as I said
 Geiler: Alr, thanks, I didn't know that
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. a domain name costs.eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com is free
 eulerscheZahl: if i'd want to have eulerschezahl.com, i would have to pay

 _Diode_: Anybody know an editor mapping to run test cases?
 dbdr: ctrl+enter&#160;?
 _Diode_: Wooooooh!
 _Diode_: Holy cow, that is amazing. How did you know about that?
 _Diode_: In the editor config section I did not see anything about that. So that must be some default then?
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: try CTRL+P _Diode_
 BlaiseEbuth: alt+f4
 _Diode_: Yes CTRL+P is a handy menu. Unfortunately it only works in 'Classic' editing mode and not 'VIM' mode. Any idea how to set a VIM mode mapping in this editor config?

 _Diode_: Hi @struct I am aware of how to change to VIM mode and how to open the editor config settings as well.But does anyone know how to set a VIM mapping to in that config?
 struct: no idea sorry, I use an external ide
 _Diode_: No problem. Maybe I need to do that.

 BlaiseEbuth: Ok

 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... Not sure I gonna manage walls/goals as collision.

 BlaiseEbuth: Erf...
 BlaiseEbuth: Haven't thought about this...
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. Just in time! I'm writting my collision detection right now. ^^
 jacek: poles colliding eh
 Astrobytes: Like a mosh pit in Wroclaw
 BlaiseEbuth: :no_mouth:
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh no blaise is in my clash of code
 FalINTOblivion0112: i am going to lose so bad i promise
 FalINTOblivion0112: mercy please blaise
 jacek: blaise clashing?
 Astrobytes: writing collision detection eh
 Astrobytes: collisions between clashers
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmmm?
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm writing my collision detection. I can't do two things at the same time.
 BlaiseEbuth: For any question relative to clashs, please ask my slave.
 BlaiseEbuth: *trainee
 HighSodium: slavee
 dbdr: when goal posts are colliding, you know something went horribly wrong
 MSmits: yay my solver is working I think. So far no errors in 30 games
 Astrobytes: A very windy day.
 Astrobytes: still d&amp;b'ing?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I implemented a pre-endgame solver. 
 MSmits: had to, to avoid getting wrecked by marchete
 Astrobytes: lol nice, another negamax?
 MSmits: yeah it's a negamax that runs until endgame and then calls another negamax
 MSmits: they even share ab
 MSmits: but have separate hashtables
 MSmits: one works with graphs and one with bitboard
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: it's much better than previous one, isn't it?
 MSmits: the solver is yes
 MSmits: it allows pre-emptive sacrifices and can use it on others. So when i am behind i should use it
 Astrobytes: Oh nice score
 MSmits: at least to reduce the losing margin
 MSmits: might still be &lt;50% wr vs mikla though
 Marchete: I win you once
 MSmits: havent checked
 Marchete:&#160;:(
 xxd: what password do I use for the CodinGame XMPP server if I use Google+ to sign in?
 MSmits: yes, but i predicted that one correctly
 jacek: xxd change your password then
 MSmits: which is more important than winning :P
 Astrobytes: 2 x bacon losses too
 Marchete: playing like sh*t got me 100% vs mikla :D
 jacek: google+? is this still a thing?
 MSmits: i am afraid to submit this more than once, because i will just be pushing mikla up
 MSmits: well that is if i am &lt;50%
 Marchete: the thing is that I won't win you more
 xxd: Well, the CodinGame terminology is Google+ but that just means using my Gmail OAuth to sign in
 jacek: oink
 Marchete: meanwhile I can win mikla morwe
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: lol, the age-old strategy of playing the most insane moves ever to confuse your opponent? :D
 Marchete: so you'll go even higher
 MSmits: so i cna always just wait
 AB_007: hi
 MSmits: Astrobytes that is exactly what he does!
 Marchete: yeah, bad moves worked against endgame nim players
 MSmits: my solver makes me somewhat immune, except when he does it too early
 Astrobytes: Seems logical
 Marchete: your solver is immune because you saw my weird moves :D
 MSmits: he'll just offer a 4 loop, so 4 free boxes, and mikla will decline because he doesnt want to lose nim
 BlaiseEbuth: You're immune, exept when you're not.
 MSmits: and then again, and again
 MSmits: so 12 free boxes for marchete
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Marchete: nim vs scores
 Astrobytes: tricksy
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but also marchete is able to loopify the map very well
 MSmits: making nim less useful, my bot doesnt do that. It's too busy trying to win at nim
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I remember the conversations
 MSmits: yea
 BlaiseEbuth: yea
 Astrobytes: aye
 MSmits: indeed
 Marchete: eya
 jacek: eeyup
 Marchete: but that's a one trick pony :D
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572966276">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572966276</a>
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: watch the scores
 Marchete: not really the best strat I guess
 Marchete: :_(
 MSmits: i mean to see they dont go down, the solver is working
 MSmits: i had many bugs today
 MSmits: esp. vs remi
 Marchete: you have 100% except mikla
 Marchete: (again)
 MSmits: and you
 Astrobytes: Still not noticed bacon online btw
 Marchete: 1?
 Marchete: lol, that's irrelevant
 MSmits: yeah ok
 MSmits: but your bot can be improved
 MSmits: if you want to, you can use my bot as a score solver in IDE and see when the score shifts
 MSmits: then you know there was a mistake somewhere
 Astrobytes: Are you the Anti-Bacon Brigade now
 MSmits: yeah!
 jacek: :star_and_crescent:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572966363">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572966363</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: see mikla makes the mistakes too
 MSmits: 22-27 to 13-36
 Marchete: probably because as the bots now it's losing
 Marchete: no matter if it's 25 or 36
 Marchete: it's a -1
 Marchete: know*
 MSmits: in the case of your bot, i would believe that
 MSmits: your bot searches the endgame
 MSmits: i dont think his does
 MSmits: it's just heuristics
 Marchete: naaah I can't win you anymore
 Marchete: usually 24-25
 MSmits: there's a chance when i sacrifice for nim
 MSmits: but it's small
 BlaiseEbuth: Sacrifice! :imp:
 MSmits: because you cant make a single mistake after
 MSmits: 2 losses vs you btw
 jacek: yay or nay? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i1.kwejk.pl/k/videos/msMs0On69vFYH8fcjrZrhRZx55K9XnCK.mp4">https://i1.kwejk.pl/k/videos/msMs0On69vFYH8fcjrZrhRZx55K9XnCK.mp4</a>

 xxd: got this working in pidgin
 jacek: :tada:
 AllYourTrees: \
 struct: maybe i just dont know how to implement smitsimax
 struct: All my tries on CSB failed
 MSmits: yurko did it better than me
 MSmits: did you compare it with another bot struct? like a gA or minimax?
 MSmits: maybe it's CSB that's the problem, not the algo
 struct: i was trying it on sogeti atm
 MSmits: csb might just be hard to eval for you
 MSmits: (it kinda is)
 struct: I never managed to code a blocker
 struct: might be the reason
 MSmits: I dont really code a blocker in csb, it just has a separate eval
 MSmits: it's like 3 lines
 struct: I think I got top 200 with smitsimax using 2 runners
 struct: in csb
 MSmits: oh, well thats not too bad
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572970501">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572970501</a>
 Marchete: why do you have a sad face?
 Marchete: can I win?
 Marchete: at 51
 MSmits: I lost nim to you
 MSmits: but regained it 
 MSmits: I cant predict how nim will go until i solve it
 MSmits: and it could be a loss for me
 Marchete: do you solve nim from there?
 dsfjkfdls: bruh
 Marchete: I was trying minimax, depth 5
 MSmits: yes as soon as the face appears, nim is solved
 MSmits: if you really want to do nim, you have to write a dedicated nim solver
 Astrobytes: So that's your nimface eh
 MSmits: it's an entirely different beast
 MSmits: yes :grin:
 Marchete: and you went from 22-27 to 24-25
 MSmits: ow crap not again
 Marchete: so it's not fully solved before 70?
 MSmits: this is my new bot?
 Marchete: guess so
 MSmits: damnit, i just went through 100 games no bug
 MSmits: and you found one
 Marchete: I'm pushing you to create the best bot ever :D
 MSmits: jeez, it's the damn loop
 MSmits: maybe you can actually play isolated loops
 MSmits: and gain
 MSmits: i thought you couldnt
 MSmits: yeah seems like that is it
 MSmits: it's not a bug, it's a faulty assumption by me
 jrke: i want to ask is opening smallest loop optimal?
 jrke: like always opening smallest loop
 MSmits: it's better than opening a bigger loop
 jrke: and cutting off big loops from search
 MSmits: but it's not better than all other moves
 MSmits: you can prune the bigger loops when a smaller one is available
 jrke: oh so pruning bigger loops is good?
 Marchete: loop-wise, yes
 Marchete: I think
 MSmits: only as long as a smaller one exists jrke
 3779295: how much computer science background do i need for bot programming
 MSmits: same with chains
 BlaiseEbuth: 0.5
 MSmits: but a small chain is not always better than a big loo
 AllYourTrees: if you know loops/if statements you can do a lot
 Astrobytes: You can't flush a big loo with a small chain
 BlaiseEbuth: :flushed:
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: (sorry)
 jrke: so just taking smallest loop, smallest closed chain and all open chains right?
 MSmits: I think I might have to rewrite a big part of my solver Marchete, you just showed you can just about play anything as a pre-emptive sacrifice
 Marchete: I thought it was this way
 Marchete: but you said no
 MSmits: because of the papers
 MSmits: they only ever talk about unfinished chains
 BlaiseEbuth: *paid papers
 Marchete: your bot right now is probably ahead of all those papers
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: but earlier i discovered also connected chains (to a join) can be pre-emptive sacrifices
 MSmits: and apparently isolated loops can also
 AllYourTrees: its crazy how much expertise there is on CG
 struct: so many experts then there is me
 Astrobytes: expertTrees eh
 AllYourTrees: we got AllYourExperts right here on CG
 Astrobytes: :D
 AllYourTrees: :D
 Astrobytes: struct don't be ridiculous
 AllYourTrees: ^
 AllYourTrees: don't sell yourself short
 MSmits: much expertise in the struct
 Astrobytes: +there is, hmmm
 AllYourTrees: you should rename yourself the inSTRUCTor
 struct: I wanted to name myself constructor
 struct: but it breaks the search bar
 struct: instructor is taken&#160;:(
 AllYourTrees: just delete there account ez
 AllYourTrees: their*
 jacek: inclassor?
 Astrobytes: There are 2 constructors, one with a c and one with a C
 BlaiseEbuth: Evaluator!
 Astrobytes: Examinator :P
 jacek: and so many destructors
 AllYourTrees: oooh destruct would be a cool alter ego
 struct: Maybe ill rename nulte
 jacek: le struct
 jacek: would be in spirit of site's language
 Astrobytes: NulteLeStruct?
 Astrobytes: structo!

 Astrobytes: Nice dance though
 dbdr: yes&#160;:)
 Marchete: rounding errors
 struct: or can it be on how the handle collisions happening at same time?
 struct: they handle*
 jrke: MS have you started pre predicting value now?
 Astrobytes: he has multiple negamax-based score solvers for different stages jrke
 jacek: soon he will predict opening books
 Marchete: he is countering bad players
 Marchete: like me :D
 Astrobytes: Hey, your strategy works though Marchete
 jrke: yeah
 Marchete: not against smits
 jrke: nice work marchete
 Marchete: like 0% winrate
 jrke: time to sleep
 jrke: gn
 Marchete: gn
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but against all others&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: gn jrke
 Marchete: in fact at some point it worked pretty good
 Marchete: even 100% vs 2nd player
 Astrobytes: Smits always spoiling the fun :P
 Marchete: yeah
 jacek: hes like eral in the funeral
 Marchete: if it wasn't for that evil scientist I could be 1st
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: He's gone full-on into D&amp;B that is for certain
 Marchete: imo it's the opposite
 Marchete: I retake D&amp;B because of him
 Marchete: like "challenge accepted"
 Marchete: but now I'll let it on hold
 Astrobytes: I can see this one lasting all year lol
 Velcoro: faced a couple of cheaters already, but today faced a cheater moderator for the first time, yay, my lucky day!
 Marchete: no, I eventually want to try NN
 Marchete: but in D&amp;B is a hard task
 Marchete: very mathematical
 MSmits: dunno, i kinda want to move on. Clobber is an idea, if i can do the claessen paper. Or i still want to do the oware NN also
 MSmits: but i cant abide untried ideas
 Marchete: do the oware NN
 Astrobytes: Not sure D&amp;B seems right for NN
 Marchete: but imo supervised is more time preparing it
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Velcoro: hm?
 Marchete: reinforced like CGZero is plug &amp; play
 MSmits: supervised requires you to know the exact solutions
 MSmits: or at least very good ones
 Marchete: D&amp;B is bad for NN Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: Clobber most likely too
 MSmits: not sure, clobber can be evalled a bit
 MSmits: jacek has a NN
 MSmits: probably NN + nim is king in clobber
 dbdr: clobber has nim too?
 MSmits: sort of, differently, but yes
 MSmits: it's not as easily implemented
 dbdr: should there be a nim multi too? puzzle?
 MSmits: would be cool
 MSmits: but you have to make it large enough so that it requires divide and conquer to solve within time limit
 MSmits: cant just be brute forced without dividing, then you didnt really nim-solve
 MSmits: a real nimsolver can beat a negamax by a factor of millions  because of the divide and conquer component
 MSmits: it's like comparing quicksort with bubblesort
 jacek: a NN vs an NN. which is it
 MSmits: the former
 jacek:&#160;:(
 MSmits: unless its a silent N
 MSmits: eural network
 jacek: i always read NN as en-en
 MSmits: yeah but when you say it out loud you dont abbreviate it i think?
 MSmits: people would just say " a net" or something
 dbdr: a ÑÑ
 MSmits: no idea what those things do
 dbdr: Ñeural Ñetworks?
 struct: en-en
 MSmits: that doesnt help dbdr
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 Marchete: Ñ¿
 Marchete: Ñ is spanish
 MSmits: what does it do
 MSmits: why dont you guys like normal N's
 struct: how does an N sounds like?
 Marchete: gn sound
 dbdr: español
 Marchete: this
 dbdr: ñiet
 MSmits: ahh
 dbdr: ñet even
 MSmits: so  ÑÑ is like the sound you make when working on a jobby?
 Astrobytes: jalapeño
 dbdr: Neural Nietwork
 Astrobytes: Nyetwork
 MSmits: gngn
 MSmits: :poop:
 dbdr: the NN that always output 0 (niet!)
 Astrobytes: I don't know what kind of jobbies you do Smits but I seldom make any sounds while doing mine
 Astrobytes: lol dbdr
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: so you have been trained by a jobby-ninja Astrobytes?
 MSmits: silent but deadly
 Astrobytes: No they're just like that by themselves. Veggie diet for ya :P
 MSmits: well I dont eat meat either
 MSmits: tbh i dont make sounds either afaik
 Astrobytes: You only drink your food 
 MSmits: yes, but lots of fiber
 MSmits: it's kinda funny
 MSmits: people always assumes it comes out the same way it looks going in
 Astrobytes: as long as it works! I would miss food though
 MSmits: like they dont chew their food into mush
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: i sometimes eat food
 MSmits: but not regularly
 MSmits: some popcorn or something
 Astrobytes: You don't miss nice food?
 MSmits: there isn't a lot of nice food i like
 MSmits: and it's mostly very unhealthy
 MSmits: or it's meat
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, I forgot you were fussy in that regard
 MSmits: like junkfood and such
 MSmits: yeah exactly
 MSmits: so this is like a perfect solution, but i realize it's not for most people
 Astrobytes: Hey, as long as you get all your nutrition I ain't judging
 jacek: keto is love keto is life
 MSmits: yeah, should be, according to food science anyways
 MSmits: dont know what keto is
 jacek: ketones
 MSmits: is this like a drug?
 Astrobytes: Do you have a medical condition that requires keto diet jacek?
 Marchete: ketonic, low carbs
 Marchete: meat + vegs
 jacek: welp im not keto stricly, but low carb + intermittent fasting
 Astrobytes: low carb veg
 MSmits: seems like that would not have much fiber
 Marchete: why not?
 MSmits: well meat doesnt have much
 jacek: flaxseed has fiber and not much net carbs
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: you have nuts too
 Marchete: and seeds
 Astrobytes: It's a pretty extreme diet mostly used in treatment of several medical conditions
 MSmits: i think the flaxseed might be in those shakes i take
 Marchete: just not empty calories from carbs
 Marchete: that makes high sugar spikes
 Astrobytes: Probably yeah MSmits
 Astrobytes: nuts and seeds are good
 Marchete: I don't see it extreme
 MSmits: i think what they do is put a lot of those seeds and nuts and stuff, grind it and dry it so it becomes a powder
 Astrobytes: flaxseed tastes like :poo: though
 Wontonimo: you can make tacos with beans and peanutbutter.  mmmm
 MSmits: also soy
 MSmits: it's vegan apparently
 Marchete: just take out bread, sugar and highly processed foods
 Marchete: with tons of starch
 Astrobytes: I only eat homemade bread
 Astrobytes: I only use sugar in cooking certain things
 MSmits: i notice sugar is really addictive. You miss it a lot when you stop, but that feeling goes away after a few weeks
 Astrobytes: The only processed foods I go for are condiments like ketchup or whatever, sometimes
 3779295: i've wanted to quit (added) sugar/processed foods but it's too hard
 Marchete: and makes you hungry fast, due to sugar spikes + insuline spike
 Astrobytes: ^
 BlaiseEbuth: Not being able to kill people over chat is kind of frustrating...
 Marchete: what?!
 MSmits: I sometimes still eat fries, at most once every 2 weeks or so, that also makes me hungry
 Astrobytes: I stopped adding sugar to things around 2000-2001, starting with coffee
 Marchete: I think keto as reduced carbs is OK
 3779295: is carbohydrates bad too, like rice and stuff
 Marchete: it's pretty balanced
 MSmits: but hey, i need to mow the lawn, got another hour of light for it. Ttyl guys 
 Marchete: meat, veggies, nuts, and some carbs
 Marchete: cya
 Astrobytes: It's not strictly the true keto diet though, just a low carb alternative diet
 Marchete: the lawnmower man
 Astrobytes: later MSmits
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: carbs stands for carbonara, right&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol, well, it's included
 Marchete: it's more from carburator, imo
 Marchete: carburetor?
 Marchete: in english, I don't know
 dbdr: carbohydrates
 dbdr: carbon and hydrogen atoms
 Astrobytes: carburetor or carburettor yes Marchete
 Marchete: no, I'm 99.6% sure it's from carburetors
 Marchete: :D
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: well, carburator is also from carbon I think
 Astrobytes: You missed an element dbdr
 dbdr: oxygen
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 dbdr: who needs oxygen thhough?
 Marchete: carburetors
 Astrobytes: And carbohydrates, or they're just hydrocarbons!
 BlaiseEbuth: Clashes are really the garbages of this site... Being called a cheater because you coded a bot, on codingame&#160;? Wtf... :rofl:
 Marchete: in fact in Spanish you can say "hidratos de carbono" or "carbohidratos"
 Astrobytes: hidratos de carbono.... that sounds nice to say out loud :D
 Astrobytes: You made a clash bot BlaiseEbuth?
 Astrobytes: Of course
 Marchete: cheeaaaateeeer
 Marchete: it's not fair, you applied knowledge and expertise here!
 jacek: who codes a bot on codingame :unamused:
 Marchete: freaks
 Astrobytes: weirdos
 BlaiseEbuth: I did. Was funny to code. But being pinged again and again by one or two 'clashs master' that don't like losing don't worth the pinch of CPs I get...
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll stop it I think. :thinking:
 Wontonimo: no, just add a random timer to it
 BlaiseEbuth: I already manage the time.
 Astrobytes: Give it another account?
 NguyenVinhHien: hybrid or native is better for mobile app bro?
 Astrobytes: I mean clash CPs aren't worth the effort imo due to the decay
 Wontonimo: add in something that looks for those "clash masters" and skips clashes with them
 Wontonimo: +1 Astrobytes
 BlaiseEbuth: Well If you play everyday there's no decay.
 Wontonimo: why on gods green earth would you play every day?\
 Astrobytes: ^
 Marchete: masochism
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't. The bot do
 BlaiseEbuth: That's all the interest
 Astrobytes: I regard it as artificial inflation unless all you do is clash, in which case it's 'worth' maintaining
 Astrobytes: artificial inflation of CPs
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Like ghost CPs
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, the gain is not big...
 FalINTOblivion0112: no pain no gain
 Astrobytes: That's why I say make a separate account for it
 Astrobytes: See how far it gets
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 FalINTOblivion0112: ಠ_ಠ
 BlaiseEbuth: Already seen ^^ Between 50th and 150th. A lot of fluctuations due to shortests and unknown clashs.
 BlaiseEbuth: Will do better if I let it run.
 Astrobytes: use python and the github golfer

 TanmaySharan: Can anybody tell me ,if i can create a group on this site or not&#160;??
 Wontonimo: #a_chat_group_for_you
 Astrobytes: A group?
 Wontonimo: click there
 Wontonimo: it's a public chat
 TanmaySharan: oh..ok
 Astrobytes: you can DM the channel name to your friends if you need to keep it private
 TanmaySharan: Got it...thanks
 Astrobytes: If you mean making a group so you can identify on the leaderboards, you could all use the same 'Company name'
 MSmits: or school
 Astrobytes: that too yes
 Illedan: or country
 Astrobytes: You can't make that one up though :P
 Illedan: Gotta be some countries without players
 Illedan: Bonaire seems good :D 15 players all below level 10
 Illedan: They wont complain
 Marchete: france too&#160;:)
 MSmits: Marchete did you submit the version that's not deterministic?
 Marchete: nope
 MSmits: oh too bad
 Marchete: do you want?
 MSmits: makes it easier for me to test my loopy errors
 MSmits: to see if i fixed it
 MSmits: i can just do a lot of IDE tests
 Maxim251: i AM ON Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game, and i want learn how make tree search
 Marchete: I've been touching stuff
 Marchete: maybe it crashes
 MSmits: oh ok, just do whatever you like. I'll find a way either way
 Marchete: it crashes
 Maxim251: exactly montecarlo tree search. I know basics, because I watch multi tutorials, but still I am not sure how write code to generete tree.
 Wontonimo: cool Maxim251 , i approve your ambitions&#160;!
 jacek: first, make game simulation. makeMove, undoMove, get list of all available moves
 MSmits: or makeStateCopy, make move, restore statecopy
 MSmits: is sometimes easier or faster
 Marchete: don't listen these guys, they don't know nothing about UTTT :D
 struct: I usually start by optimizing
 Astrobytes: game specific
 jacek: premature optimization eh
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: It's his speciality jacek
 struct: its bad but I cant stop it
 struct: So I just embraced it
 KiwiTae: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNH0MuQ51m4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNH0MuQ51m4</a>
 jacek: drink so brake fluids then
 Astrobytes: works well quite often though struct
 Wontonimo: I don't see your bot on UTTT Maxim251 
 struct: it works for simple stuff I think
 struct: games like uttt, bt, c4 are all "simple" to sim
 Astrobytes: clobber is really easy to sim too
 struct: yeah
 jacek: so is some :soccer: game
 struct: my both a msmits bot are probably equal
 struct: my bot*
 struct: and 
 struct: cant type today
 Maxim251: What id UTT?
 Astrobytes: Ultimate Troublesome Tiring Tedium

 Illedan: Damn, smitty predicting the score :O
 Astrobytes: that's his nim-solving face
 Illedan: nim?
 Marchete: not nim I think
 Marchete: faces are nim
 Marchete: scores are calculated
 Astrobytes: oh yeah sorry, didn't notice he got the score too
 Astrobytes: but the face is nim yeah
 MSmits: Illedan nim is a way to predict who has to open the first chain when there are no safe moves left
 Maxim251: I just try to start code that game, thats why I am not  on batle ranking
 Illedan: Is that an algo?
 Illedan: Math?
 MSmits: it was Marchete in that game, which is in my favor
 MSmits: math
 Illedan: ok
 MSmits: however, i had to sacrifice 1 box to get there
 Astrobytes: look up nim game theory
 Marchete: but I'm still winning you...
 MSmits: yes, because of the 1 box
 MSmits: i sacrificed
 MSmits: frame 46
 Illedan: Ah, that game
 Illedan: Ic
 MSmits: if you dont sacrifice any boxes and you win the nim game, you win the entire game, always
 Astrobytes: sprague-grundy etc etc nimstrings nimbers
 MSmits: but i didnt have any choice, i had to sacrifice that box
 MSmits: or no nim-win for me
 MSmits: of course if i had score solved by then, then nim would be irrelevant, but nim-solving is way easier than score solving, so it's a tough choice
 Astrobytes: is there some way to probabilistically choose between them?
 MSmits: well yes
 Marchete: anyways 38% winrate :S
 Astrobytes: And interpolate
 MSmits: i could look at the map, if it has a lot of large chains, it's safe to sacrifice boxes
 MSmits: against marchete thats rarely the case
 MSmits: so i could use that
 Marchete: :innocent:
 MSmits: 38% is good man
 Marchete: the problem I saw is that
 Marchete: sometimes with long chains I just give a lot of boxes
 Marchete: I'd need to limit the sacrifices
 MSmits: yes long chains are rarely worth sacrificing
 MSmits: in theory they can be, but in that case there's probably something shorter also
 MSmits: i am testing soon if it is ever worth it to sacrifice an isolated 3+ chain
 Marchete: anyways you are +3pts vs everyone else
 MSmits: cool&#160;:)
 Marchete: if you keep improving is because it's a challenge
 Marchete: my submitted is random now
 Marchete: so you can test
 MSmits: thats great, thanks
 jacek: yeah, it sucks when youre 1st all the time
 jacek: its like curse
 martinpapa69: suffering from success
 MSmits: it's a burden to be sure
 struct: cant relate
 MSmits: only because of NN's 
 MSmits: if you had started boardgames before that, you would have been nr 1 in a few places
 struct: maybe its time for me to join NNside
 MSmits: if it's fun
 struct: might be more enjoyable than writing random eval
 struct: hoping it works
 Astrobytes: yeah, don't NN because you feel you have to
 MSmits: yeah i never did like that much either
 MSmits: the eval thing
 Wontonimo: automate the random evel , aka NN
 MSmits: and now that benching isnt really an option, it's harder
 jacek: theres still so many different things regarding NNS
 Astrobytes: I enjoy evals and pruning techniques
 jacek: some are crappy, some are good, some are copycats of certain article and still they differ between themselves
 MSmits: me too, but I think to keep enjoying it, i would have to write a framework for fitting params, much like NN trainign pipeline
 Astrobytes: then do it
 MSmits: yeah it's just 1 more thing for the list
 struct: well you can use euler tool
 Astrobytes: The List
 struct: the paramfiddler
 MSmits: euler tool is better than nothing, but there are better ways
 struct: ofc
 MSmits: it trains 1 param at a time
 MSmits: i often have like 8 or more
 Wontonimo: yikes
 struct: yeap
 Astrobytes: yes, I've never found a use for it tbh
 struct: I tried it on spring challenge
 struct: I had 20+ paramaeters
 struct: :D
 jacek: euler tool?
 jacek: 1 param? thats some sort binary search eh
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: paramfiddler, on his github
 Wontonimo: have you heard of TPE optimization&#160;?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/ParameterFiddler">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/ParameterFiddler</a>
 MSmits: maybe if you say what it stands for
 Astrobytes: I have now
 struct: TPE?
 Astrobytes:  Tree Parzen Estimator
 jacek: hmm 1-delta, 1+delta? sounds like that stockfish tuner thing
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish%27s_Tuning_Method">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish%27s_Tuning_Method</a>
 Wontonimo: it's in pythonfrom hyperopt import tpe
 Wontonimo: i've used it to find the optimal parameter combo of 200 hyper parameters in 120 simulations
 Astrobytes: import everything
 jacek: still, for hyperparamters i resort to good old grid/random search, and/or semi-manually tuning
 Astrobytes: import speed
 Astrobytes: Error: no such library
 MSmits: may have to install it first Astrobytes
 AllYourTrees: import optimal_parametersprint("finished")
 Astrobytes: or snort it if you want to optimize python :P
 MSmits: that too
 SmileyCash: hi travis
 leechmanz: whats up griffin
 leechmanz: griffin you suck at coding 
 SmileyCash: okay sorry&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: you can make your own channel
 Astrobytes: #my_school_channel
 Astrobytes: click there and stay out of world chat
 MSmits: try #bronies4life
 Astrobytes: No mercy Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't like hate when it doesn't come from me.
 MSmits: Marchete testing the isolated chain thing now. I set up 10k boards where i solve, assuming all isolated loops and chains are also fair game. Now trying without the chains, seeing if i get different solved result
 MSmits: so far it doesnt seem to matter if i remove them
 MSmits: crap found one
 MSmits: the 730th board
 MSmits: 1010th too
 SmileyCash: that leechmanz guy really sucks at coding
 Wontonimo: hey SmileyCash , what do you think of the people who coded these bots?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572981989">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572981989</a>
 Wontonimo: you think you could crush them?
 Wontonimo: they are pretty much just driving straight
 Astrobytes: Bit late for that Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: tfw your alt got Gold in FB and your main didn't
 darkhorse64: submit alt code [solved]
 Astrobytes: That has not worked so far unfortunately
 darkhorse64: rage submit
 Astrobytes: Tried that too
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Focusing on making it a bit better :P
 darkhorse64: use my recipe for Legend: mag us + pb 4
 Astrobytes: At least the Sogeti contest made me focus on something else
 Astrobytes: what's pb 4 got to do with it?
 darkhorse64: mag us sim and pb 4 eval
 Astrobytes: Oh I see
 Astrobytes: I still have to get gold with this reflex bot first
 darkhorse64: Same thing for me: Sogeti made me focus on FB code and I see I have large improvements left
 struct: one performance tip I can give is do not calculate all collisions
 struct: when one collision happen
 Astrobytes: That's what I said earlier, prioritise
 darkhorse64: you can cache collisions too
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: only process the most important one
 Astrobytes: (At the time)
 struct: you can also make avx sim to calculate multiple collisions at once
 struct: but I wouldnt dare to try it&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Yep, too ambitious for me atm
 darkhorse64: gn all
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn
 Illedan: where is pb 4 eval?
 Illedan: pms?
 dbdr: struct: how do you know which collision happens first without calculating all of them?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/fantastic-bits-feedback-strategy/2360/54">https://forum.codingame.com/t/fantastic-bits-feedback-strategy/2360/54</a>
 struct: dbdr I calculate them all at the start of the turn
 struct: but after one collision happens I dont need to calculate them all again
 dbdr: right, only those involving collided entities
 struct: yes
 struct: Also you can try doing map zones like it some people described on meanmax
 Astrobytes: What like quadtrees or something?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/mean-max-cc01-feedback-strategies/5030/11">https://forum.codingame.com/t/mean-max-cc01-feedback-strategies/5030/11</a>
 struct: maybe cant be applied here
 struct: I read it a long time so I might not remember well
 Astrobytes: yeah, same kinda thing
 Illedan: I have both map zones and collision caching in my FB bot. I have so much optim in this shit and no good algo :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: think simpler
 Illedan: Why?
 Astrobytes: then go complex
 Illedan: My network is training, can't go much more complex
 struct: you are doing NN?
 Astrobytes: oh well in that case, ignore previous comments :P
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: It fails spectaculary
 struct: gl
 Illedan: spectacularly*
 Illedan: 100k datapoints and it can't learn shit
 Astrobytes: Again: think simple - you may have missed something
 Illedan: Yeah, I guess 186 inputs are too much&#160;:(
 MSmits: wait, is this 186 inputs one hot?
 Illedan: some of them
 Astrobytes: how many?
 struct: Illedan how well does it do with only 1 wizard?
 struct: 1 wizard vs nothing
 Illedan: 70 onehot ish
 Astrobytes: Like any wizard I would hope it just sits there and chills struct :P
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: vs nothing?
 Illedan: I even have bludger targets in here
 Illedan: xD
 struct: well people did try to make a runner only on csb
 Astrobytes: Yeah I got the idea, just a good joke opportunity
 Illedan: And no, I didn't try something simple first
 Illedan: Hence I have a 30 line long loss function
 MSmits: wait, did you do other NN's before?
 Illedan: Sure
 MSmits: cuz this seems like a hard way to practice it
 Illedan: Learned a lot though
 Astrobytes: Even an Oware NN!
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Not a Marchet e one either
 Astrobytes: Sorry Illedan, didn't mean to speak for you :D
 MSmits: he doesnt mind
 Illedan: Hm? someone spoke?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: You made SR for practising NN right Illedan? iirc
 Illedan: Yeah, but my motivation is weak for own challenged goals
 Astrobytes: That's fair, I can understand that
 struct: ok ill port arimaa where only NNs will do well
 Astrobytes: Are you finally going to finish that?
 struct: I think its too hard
 struct: for cg
 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Don't be ridiculous.
 Astrobytes: Where else can you do such things other than offline.
 struct: Ok Ill port it this weekend
 struct: but i dont hope having many players
 struct: Game is way too hard
 Astrobytes: Well look at Yinsh!
 struct: yeah but 4 moves per turn
 struct: I dont even remember all the rules
 struct: Rules are simple though
 Astrobytes: Just cause it's hard doesn't mean to say it's not worth trying out. If it fails in contrib phase then we chuck it
 Wontonimo: that's this?
 struct: What do you mean Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: wad u tak abut?
 Astrobytes: Arimaa
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4616/arimaa">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4616/arimaa</a>
 Illedan: Damn, so many rules in the first section
 Illedan: gl hf
 Illedan: Anyway, I'm off, bye
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn Illedan
 Astrobytes: The game itself is simple. Winning it is not&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: For bots at least
 Astrobytes: That was the point of it right?
 struct: yes
 struct: anyways im also out for tonight
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn struct, take it easy

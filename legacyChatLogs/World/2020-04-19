 eulerscheZahl: 5 lakes
 Zenoscave: oops. no battling in lakes
 skotz: wow
 eulerscheZahl: Swagboy 01:43AMI can break any code with one character
 eulerscheZahl: ok, you can still add one. impressive anyways
 Zenoscave: mame has some cool quines
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's even the same user. I knew about this one too, just didn't recognize the author <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">https://github.com/mame/quine-relay</a>
 cegprakash: last battles is crashing
 eulerscheZahl: fix it
 metahom: omg. 0.15 pts to boss
 metahom: do I wait? do I resubmit?
 dbdr: which boss?
 metahom: gold one
 dbdr: I would wait
 metahom: ok, thx
 kovi: wait for push
 kovi: sorry for late/scroll
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you wait.your winrate against the boss isn't good enough to spam him down
 metahom: yea, that makes sence. I need 2 games from anyone whosubmits to gols
 metahom: gold*
 metahom: thanks guys
 dbdr: I broke my bot by removing spaces in the code :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i suddenly get so many wins against you
 eulerscheZahl: did you convert to python?
 dbdr: sed 's/ {/{/g'
 dbdr: blindly
 dbdr: except that the positioning isprint("{} {}", x, y);
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 cegprakash: phew
 cegprakash: Bronze
 kovi:&#160;:)
 kovi: gratz ceg
 eulerscheZahl: now you spawn at 127
 dbdr: exactly
 cegprakash: now what do mines do
 cegprakash: I don't want to read statement
 dbdr: as wondering where I left a debugging print on stdout by accident
 dbdr: *was
 struct: I think the statement is a require to understand the rules
 dbdr: legend is too big
 struct: But I guess you can keep asking in chat
 eulerscheZahl: reading the statement is an entry barrier to play bronze
 AntiSquid: last battles don't load anymore for me from the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: changes are even in green
 struct: perks of joining late
 eulerscheZahl: buy premium AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: works for me
 eulerscheZahl: even though a bot has 359 battles in the history, yet it says progress: 5%
 eulerscheZahl: 361 now <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/s25sh9">https://prnt.sc/s25sh9</a>
 dbdr: the 7K match submit :D
 dbdr: if it ever finishes
 eulerscheZahl: it might show *my* progress on someone elses battles
 dbdr: makes total sense
 eulerscheZahl: got increased to 15%, no matter which player battles i open
 dbdr: very self-centered
 eulerscheZahl: is that something for your discord bugs channel? :D
 dbdr: I saw it as mostly for emergencies
 dbdr: so I would say forum
 dbdr: but you're free&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i see the forum for more serious cases. this one is a minor bug i don't really care about
 dbdr:  /dev/null then&#160;:)
 dbdr: winrate increased as I moved up the lb
 dbdr: let's see how long that trend continues&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: maybe you only have half-member package euler? otherwise you'd see the other 95% 
 dbdr: better to struggle against bottom and do well against middle than the opposite, I think&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so i actually have the 5% member package then?
 dbdr: wow, Fangel #5 in python
 elusivecodes: Is it just me or does Python always win the Shortest code clashes?
 eulerscheZahl: just you
 eulerscheZahl: ruby and bash can beat python
 AntiSquid: or "basic membership" whatever they call it
 eulerscheZahl: perl too
 AntiSquid: it's just you there was someone in chat moaning ruby users are basically cheating
 eulerscheZahl: so you are doing CPU heavy operations dbdr?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i missed that ruby chat
 dbdr: partially
 eulerscheZahl: but always easier to complain about others using technology to their advantage than to learn it yourself
 dbdr: why are you asking eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: because you mentioned a python bot at the top
 eulerscheZahl: for a heuristic only bot it wouldn't matter
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: there is also a correlation, most top players use fast languages
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: top player =&gt; C++, not onlyc++ =&gt; top player
 AntiSquid: why doesn't this give an error? torpedo = {-1.-1.-9999,-1}
 dbdr: isn't there plenty of C++ in bronze?
 struct: language?
 AntiSquid: imo there should be more python bots in gold since it's easier to code
 struct: I dont think that makes a lot of  sence
 AntiSquid: but at least it makes sense
 dbdr: it does, esp if you have limited time
 AntiSquid: there's a lot more you need to write just to get started with this contest
 struct: Most of the time isnt about language difficulty
 AntiSquid: struct c++ wood1&#160;! i think you stopped since there's an awful lot more to write up just to get started, but hey i could be wrong
 kovi: dbdr came out of hiding?
 dbdr: not hiding, i was working on a new feature&#160;:)
 dbdr: might be lucky right now
 eulerscheZahl: hungarians united again
 dbdr: it's too early to come out of hiding
 dbdr: for those doing that
 dbdr: same code finished #12, but that started 5/5 and spent half the time in bottom
 dbdr: this one started 9/10
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean 9/1 or 5/10 maybe?
 dbdr: right, not being consistent :D
 dbdr: 5/10 and 9/10
 dbdr: clearer
 kovi: owned me hard, hence screwed my analyze by submit strat
 dbdr: you're only #2?&#160;;)
 kovi: you also messed up others, joli #1, pb #3
 dbdr: you mean bc I lose badly against them?
 kovi: oh, hmm....not sure why then
 metahom: weeeeee
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 eulerscheZahl: waiting was a good idea
 metahom: thanks for advices
 metahom: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: oh, another c# bot that will beat me&#160;:(
 dbdr: gz metahom!
 dbdr: you can still switch languages&#160;;)
 kovi: gratz
 metahom: thanks, dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: dummy submit in D
 metahom: I guess I will not, eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: you'll have the entire D community come over to praise you
 eulerscheZahl: still timing out kovi? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452393005">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452393005</a>
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid both of them? :o
 kovi: i blame dbdr, he became more resilient and now i timeout
 cegprakash: wait.. now I've to detonate mines in bronze?
 cegprakash: is mines necessary in bronze
 Nerchio: ;o 8 new people in legend since yesterday
 cegprakash: I got to bronze by using only Move and SONAR
 cegprakash: and torpedo ofc
 dbdr: the real challenge is to go legend using only SURFACE
 Quidome: :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: :D
 cegprakash: i don't want challenge
 cegprakash: I want promotion
 dbdr: look at you URL. it's a challenge
 dbdr: *your
 vbplaya: I've made it to Silver only using torpedo and silence.  Just got promoted
 lxnn: Hi, I was wondering: is there any kind of easy way to overlay a heat-map on the game, for debugging and analysis purposes?
 lxnn: Or is it even possible at all?
 kovi: i like the idea of debug layer
 eulerscheZahl: on the codingame website: no
 eulerscheZahl: you can clone the official repo and add whatever you want. but that will only work offline
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC had that kind of visual debugging, i highly appreciated it
 Nerchio: damn i got pushed from ~20 to ~35 :pp
 lxnn: Ok thanks, I'll have to brush up on my Java :sweat_smile:
 ThomasNicoullaud: \o
 eulerscheZahl: hello chat
 Nerchio: :no_mouth:
 AntiSquid: free?
 eulerscheZahl: dobby is freeeee
 AntiSquid: FREE&#160;! FREEDOM! WE CAN CHAT
 Nerchio: btw you guys chrome or something else
 Nerchio: i swear it eats so much cpu
 eulerscheZahl: chromium
 AntiSquid: firefox
 eulerscheZahl: the CG website takes a lot of RAM
 eulerscheZahl: but it got better with the SDK games aleady
 eulerscheZahl: once i had to hold a presentation about game theory at a university class. decided CG would be a good idea to visualize (tron game for minimax)
 eulerscheZahl: was the 2nd to hold a presentation that day, opened the replay before
 eulerscheZahl: when it was my turn, the laptop was completely frozen, had to reboot with everyone waiting for me
 Nerchio: :D
 Nerchio: feelsbad
 NormantasStankevicius: eulerscheZahl that sounds somewhat like a shitty nightmare
 AntiSquid: could have recorded the video&#160;?
 Riyuk: Live demos effect
 AntiSquid: should have done backflips while waiting for it to load
 eulerscheZahl: tutors said something like "i bet it's a Windows" (was a Linux)
 AntiSquid: do people still meet with their university colleagues?
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't seen any of them after i graduated
 Nerchio: so you find yourself in a middle of a minefield
 Nerchio: how do you escape xD
 eulerscheZahl: either you have silence charged and run for your life or you die
 cegprakash: is using mines required in bronze or silver?
 cegprakash: I see bronze boss doesn't use mines
 cegprakash: I want to get into silver
 eulerscheZahl: it's your free decision what to use
 YannT: either I found an actual improvement or I had a very lucky push&#160;:)
 kovi: not lucky vs. me
 YannT: jesus I didn't see that
 YannT: I'm so bad vs. top3
 pb4: Improve against kovi please
 wlesavo: i have 50% against top 2-4 this submit and then 1-10 against kovi
 kovi: top2 is really close now
 wlesavo: oh, wrong stats, not counting siman
 NormantasStankevicius: I was just placed 2nd
 NormantasStankevicius: in silver, I kinda want to somewhat cry xd
 MSmits: people time out so much in this contest still, even in legend
 MSmits: it's pretty weird
 MSmits: if I do a test on cg bench I get 10% timeouts
 MSmits: from other people
 MSmits: I guess it depends on the balance between mines and silence. I probably cause people to timeout more than average
 MSmits: or not... it's weird either way
 MSmits: Yannt, I think if you chain submit, you can push me into top 10 :P
 MSmits: my winrate vs you is very high somehow. Maybe timeouts&#160;:)
 YannT: yes I'm pretty vulnerable to chain silencing&#160;;)
 YannT: I have a thing for that, but depending on how it falls I might still timeout
 MSmits: well I am not actually chain silencing, I just selftrack and if your cellcount gets below a certain value, I silence
 YannT: yes, a.k.a chain silencing :p
 MSmits: well ok :P
 YannT: doing that will inflate your path count dramatically
 MSmits: yeah it seems so
 MSmits: thats why i timeouted myself a lot before, until i fixed it&#160;:)
 YannT: but I've elected not to bother with it because the top bots don't do that, it's bad in the grand scheme of thiings against any bot that doesn't timeout :p
 MSmits: it's just a constant in my case. I try different values, this is what I end up with more or less
 YannT: the trick is to silence when actually needed, not just to prop up your positions count when it doesn't matter&#160;;)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452483424">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452483424</a>
 MSmits: this is not chain silence is it? Look at the mines i placed
 MSmits:  iguess at the end it is
 MSmits: but thats because I covered the map pretty well already
 MSmits: in that area
 MSmits: my bot doesnt like to put mines that overlap so if the game is long it ends up silencing a lot
 YannT: you're way under my timeout threshold here too, I shouldn't timeout
 YannT: but I guess GC is going to do its thing whenever it feels like it anyway :p
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: oh right, kotlin
 MSmits: I have almost everything object pooled
 MSmits: you can do this in kotlin too I'm sure
 YannT: I wish you could disable the GC
 MSmits: no garbage then
 YannT: it's actually pointless it just collects a gazillion tiny objects
 YannT: I don't know how much heap you've got on CG but my guess is it's enough to just hold everything in memory
 MSmits: Node nodes[NODE_MAX];
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: so do that, make a global array
 MSmits: put nodes, paths, states, or whatever in them
 MSmits: and use those objects
 YannT: yeah I did that on UTTT
 MSmits: on uttt it wont work well
 MSmits: unless you do c++
 YannT: it does work well
 MSmits: how many objects?
 MSmits: above 2 million, C# gave out
 MSmits: I do 25 million in C++
 YannT: private const val MAX_STATES = 1500000
 MSmits: thats peanuts
 MSmits: i use 25 milion twice in a game of uttt in c++
 MSmits: probably 30-40 million nodes during the whole game
 MSmits: you cant do that with a language that forces you to initialize your objects
 MSmits: it means writing 700 mb of memory
 MSmits: took me a while to figure that out for C#, i kept getting weird errors
 MSmits: but for this game (ooc) you can easily initialize the objects. You dont need very many
 YannT: yes I could probably do that but to me it's a non issue, the top bots don't time me out
 YannT: I'm more concerned about my disposition towards trying to collect ennemy mines like pokemons
 MSmits: gotta catch em all
 MSmits: I'm done coding for this for now. The only thing I can think of is a minimax for combat, but I dont feel like another day of frantic heavy coding
 MSmits: just trying to fit some constants
 WINWINWIN: Guys in top 3 are constant but order is changing constantly xD
 MSmits: had to say now with people submitting so much
 MSmits: seems pb 4 is pretty much in the lead
 AntiSquid: indeed maybe after contest it's easier to gain clarity
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, does anyone AI hide here?
 MSmits: you mean by looking at the final leaderboard&#160;? :P
 AntiSquid: but this might be the advantage of having so many multis, one of them got to be quiet
 MSmits: WINWINWIN it sometimes happens yes, but it's not the main way we do things
 MSmits: many are quiet AntiSquid, go uttt&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: So no-one would suddenly pop up to the top?
 MSmits: It can happen
 pb4: WINWINWIN&#160;: how would we know beforehand&#160;?
 MSmits: he means from earlier contest
 WINWINWIN: Meant, has it happened before
 MSmits: the answer is yes, I think on average one good player does it per contest
 MSmits: but they dont always end up top 5
 eulerscheZahl: but sometimes they come out of nowhere and win
 MSmits: yep
 WINWINWIN: Wow
 MSmits: it's not illegal, but most of us dont like it, because if everyone did it, the excitement would be gone
 pb4: ^
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, it kind of kills the competition
 pb4: not the competition, the fun
 MSmits: The one or two times I have been near the top I held back 1 or 2 improvements until I saw people passing me
 MSmits: in the end its all on the leaderboard because I need it
 eulerscheZahl: i like the RAIC platform more on that: every game you play is public and you can play against every version of each player
 eulerscheZahl: so of course you can hide your bot and submit last second
 eulerscheZahl: but it's not that 1-sided advantage of A testing against B but B not even knowing about A
 MSmits: yeah thats a weak part of CG's system
 AntiSquid: i go by CG points usually MSmits
 AntiSquid: need to re-do crystal rush next
 MSmits: you mean cp?
 MSmits: oh to decide which multi to do
 MSmits: I want to finish onitama first
 MSmits: maybe then breakthrough, or some multi that gives a lot of cp
 Luxer: how to make binary searching in 2 dimensions?
 MSmits: stc seems ok, still need to think more on tge and back to the code is easy cp
 MSmits: do it separately Luxer
 AntiSquid: you mean shadow of the knight puzzle luxer?
 MSmits: for batman
 Luxer: yes
 MSmits: keep pushing me guys
 WINWINWIN: lol MSmits, only the guys that timeout against u are submitting?
 MSmits: not sure
 MSmits: some lucky streak maybe
 AntiSquid: give me your luck
 MSmits: where are you at in gold now AntiSquid&#160;?
 AntiSquid: random rank
 AntiSquid: #11 - #70 to be absolutely accurate and precise
 MSmits: really? It was never *that* random for me
 AntiSquid: final rank will be down to luck no doubt
 MSmits: when I was near top gold, I was #2-#12 or so
 MSmits: maybe the margin widens when you go down
 AntiSquid: well i don't cover the mine tracking very well to be honest
 AntiSquid: so when i get it right i get good rank&#160;?
 MSmits: if you still have time to code it, i have  no problems explaining it
 MSmits: but i use bitboard
 MSmits: not sure if that would help
 AntiSquid: i even eliminate paths based on where mines were triggered
 AntiSquid: there might be a bug somewhere but too many paths to analyze
 MSmits: yeah thats essential
 MSmits: oh you time out?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: just can't debug 
 MSmits: ah yeah.... well I completely suck at debugging myself. I just reread the same code dozens of times until I get lucky and see the bug
 AntiSquid: takes too long to debug anyway i mean and sometimes i end up breaking stuff more
 AntiSquid: i have a very complicated structure which is part of the issue
 wlesavo: fix it?
 AntiSquid: i opted for easy to move stuff around route instead of readability :p
 wlesavo: 20 more hours
 MSmits: AntiSquid I know the feeling. My structure isnt complicated but for some reason I went with a weird recursion instead of a loop
 Nerchio: zenos needs to fix his finishing shots xD
 AntiSquid: nah, i rather add new bugs wlesavo
 MSmits: so i have a list of opponent orders and feed them into a recursive function that handles them 1 by  1
 MSmits: with an increasing index
 MSmits: so basically it's just a loop :P
 MSmits: dunno how that happened
 AntiSquid: you could rewrite no?
 dbdr: MSmits "for some reason I went with a weird recursion instead of a loop"
 dbdr: rings a bell :D
 MSmits: yes i know I did it before :P
 dbdr: seems you are made for LISP&#160;:)
 MSmits: yea maybe
 dbdr: in LISP recursion is more natural than loops
 AntiSquid: here some fun syntax my bot has MSmits:mapp[tx][ty].ending[p][idx]-&gt;mines-&gt;operator[](k)-&gt;x
 wlesavo: top5 went to full resub mode
 MSmits: nice AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: more fun to play with pointers than the actual game
 wlesavo: do you charge the pointer before using it?
 YannT: player.findTorpedo()?.apply { player.torpedo(this) }
 AntiSquid: no, it costs life points instead wlesavo
 YannT: kotlin has fun syntax too sometimes
 YannT: find torpedo? TORPEDO THIS!
 MSmits: my most complicated and bug vulnerable lines look like this:
 MSmits: if (posX &lt; 14 &amp;&amp; ((blocked[posY] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (14 - (posX + 1)))) == 0))
 wlesavo: AntiSquid oh, i see, i believe you decrease your mental health as well
 MSmits: HS is the only game where I used pointers to pointers
 MSmits: never touching that code again
 AntiSquid: nah it's fun
 MSmits: makes my head hurt
 MSmits: bitboards dont anymore, but pointers to pointers are wicked magic
 AntiSquid: easy to mess up
 MSmits: yes
 AntiSquid: too often something points to the exact same address :D
 AntiSquid: and when i delete one thing i cleaned up half of my tracking
 MSmits: stuff like that happens yea
 MSmits: I also like how you can recast pointers to different types and such and the compiler optimizations starts optimizing stuff out that is actually still needed
 MSmits: because you are doing stuff the compiler assumes you would never do
 wlesavo: i wonder if illedan will make his rewrite in time
 duckquackduck: "An error occurred (#314): "Submitted code is too big". Please contact codersHS@codingame.com"
 dbdr: oh, Illedan is rewriting?
 MSmits: not exactly
 MSmits: you need to reduce the number of characters
 MSmits: you can also rename some big variables
 MSmits: but gz on coding so much&#160;:)
 duckquackduck: ok thanks, I have lot of commented code, removing that should help, right?
 MSmits: yeah
 duckquackduck: thanks&#160;:) 
 MSmits: better to keep a diary in a separate
 MSmits: file
 wlesavo: dbdr he said he have a complete different version, dunno the fate of this rewrite though
 dbdr: his current bot is from last night
 dbdr: but might just be a repush of the same
 cegprakash: I just added some nice check. But I clear enemy history of movements whenever he uses a silence
 cegprakash: I now fire only if enemy target is a possible position for enemy
 MSmits: i wouldnt clear history unless you really need to because of state explosion
 cegprakash: what do I do when he uses silence
 cegprakash: ignore?
 MSmits: you create a new state for each position he can go to
 cegprakash: that's too many
 MSmits: so it's a giant state multiplier, could easily make your number of states go x10
 MSmits: but then it quickly drops down over the next few turns, it only becomes a problem when he chain silences
 MSmits: then you write a pruning function
 MSmits: to prune states and lower the amount
 MSmits: it's easier to do with a bitboard, the pruning is
 MSmits: take all the states, get some kind of map with a key based on position
 MSmits: loop over states
 MSmits: check if the key exists, if so, combine their separate histories and make it 1 state
 MSmits: if not, add the state to the map
 MSmits: you'll get at most 200 states or so after pruning
 cegprakash: impossible
 MSmits: make sure you only use common cells for the histories, if one state has a cell in history and the other doesnt, clear it out
 cegprakash: there are more than 300 states
 MSmits: not after pruning
 MSmits: there are max 225 cells so...
 cegprakash: but the final answer is 225 cells yes
 MSmits: the difficulty is with mines
 MSmits: but usually when they mine, i dont get chain silence problems
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/4zqrcd0iznl01.jpg">https://i.redd.it/4zqrcd0iznl01.jpg</a>
 MSmits: it sure is AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: was a reply to the 300 states
 MSmits: oww ok
 MSmits: i thought you were going for a last minute dash for legend
 MSmits: and just shared the sentiment
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: uhm gave up in wood2
 AntiSquid: dunno how even got here
 MSmits: what is your usual rank on contests?
 AntiSquid: random
 AntiSquid: depends on time
 AntiSquid: or not
 cegprakash: my history remover for silence is in top 30.. I'll remove sonar and try if it improves my bot
 MSmits: if i look at your contest history, this is maybe your best result isnt it? 
 AntiSquid: no 
 MSmits: maybe looking wrong
 AntiSquid: how can this be the best?
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: i was looking at cp lol
 MSmits: not rank
 AntiSquid: kutulu was my best
 AntiSquid: i think
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: and code a la mode second best
 eulerscheZahl: and wondev woman at 3
 AntiSquid: but i honestly didn't have that much for kutulu and didn't have a pathfinding, which is weird i got where i did
 MSmits: its a bit hard to compare fairly, because the participant count matters and also eulerscheZahl always says people improved in the last few years
 MSmits: so this might still be the best achievement
 MSmits: with so many participants
 AntiSquid: then ooc is my best result? most complicated game
 cegprakash: MSmits what u said sounds like a BFS
 cegprakash: that should work?
 MSmits: you mean the pruning cegprakash?
 AntiSquid: rank / complication
 cegprakash: yes
 MSmits: it only shares the hash function
 MSmits: with bfs
 MSmits: other than that it is different
 MSmits: you just keep 1 state for every possible cell and you combine the histories
 cegprakash: I can clear the history after an enemy surface
 MSmits: if you want to track mines properly, you also need to combine mine-history, thats painful
 cegprakash: this way no point is repeated
 MSmits: ah, i dont clear on surface either
 MSmits: AntiSquid not sure if complication is a fair way to assess your achievement, because your opponents have the same complication as you
 cegprakash: at any depth I, I can't have more than 225 points
 MSmits: so its'both an advantage and a disadvantage
 kovi: pb4, what is this magic? now i have 25% vs. you
 cegprakash: say if there are 500 turns in the game, I'll have  to calculate 500*225 points
 cegprakash: but I only need the last level
 cegprakash: last turn*
 MSmits: ah... well its because you dont use a bitboard that you get into problems on long games cegprakash
 MSmits: you probably have some huge path object&#160;?
 cegprakash: what is a bitboard
 cegprakash: yes I have a string MSmits
 MSmits: ouch
 MSmits: strings are slow
 MSmits: let me show you the bitboard
 cegprakash: enemyHistory ESWWWSSSSEESWWWWSWNNEENNNNNEENENNNWSSWSWNNENN
 MSmits: thats the entire state
 MSmits: includes history also
 MSmits: well a visited cells map that is
 MSmits: and a "mines were laid from"  map
 YannT: I use int[16] (the last int is position) :p
 MSmits: that works
 cegprakash: why 16 bits?
 cegprakash: shouldn't it be 15*15 = 225 bits
 MSmits: 15 bits is a row
 YannT: no, an array of 16 32 bits ints
 MSmits: there is no uint15_t
 MSmits: so i cant use it :p
 MSmits: thats why i need to do things like this: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fb0181e6-7ad4-4cb4-ac1b-34b3eae73e3a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fb0181e6-7ad4-4cb4-ac1b-34b3eae73e3a</a>
 MSmits: I the "LEFT_EDGE" is to remove the unused bit
 cegprakash: u do something like a matrix multipication MSmits?
 MSmits: no thats not it
 MSmits: its just shifting maps
 MSmits: for example, to place a blast area on a map I get this: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/701d73e5-a906-460c-92e3-845adf901d3f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/701d73e5-a906-460c-92e3-845adf901d3f</a>
 MSmits: and then i shift it to the right position
 YannT: why do you need to shift the bitboard tho?
 MSmits: just said that above&#160;:)
 MSmits: also this: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/12ee39c4-ebe3-4029-90ec-1e306b9864ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/12ee39c4-ebe3-4029-90ec-1e306b9864ae</a>
 MSmits: i shift sectors too
 YannT: ah I see
 cegprakash: u don't know enemy's start position or current position I don't know how can u make a map like this
 cegprakash: u can only ignore the impossibilities
 MSmits: you make a map for each possible cell, I start a state for each possible position
 MSmits: visited map is empty
 MSmits: mine map is empty
 MSmits: (except for start cell btw, that is on the visited map ofcv)
 MSmits: i even have 64 bit blast map
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f94c0e23-e396-40d9-b332-e5120bb5c51f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f94c0e23-e396-40d9-b332-e5120bb5c51f</a>
 MSmits: this is to record damage
 MSmits: because center cell gets 2 damage
 MSmits: I shift that too, but i shift it 4x as much
 MSmits: (because 4 bit per 1 cell)
 cegprakash: hey
 cegprakash: I don't understand all this theory shit
 MSmits: this sort of thing is fun for me. After all that stuff was done, the game became less fun and i lost motivation
 cegprakash: say enemy moves NEWS
 cegprakash: what does ur map have
 cegprakash: it should basically have all points
 MSmits: it has 4 new set bits on the visited 
 cegprakash: right?
 Grudo: i saw people write on game screen, how to do that?
 cegprakash: in case of no islands
 MSmits: yes, it has 4 bits set on visited and the position (x, y) will have changed
 MSmits: Grudo if it is ooc, then with MSG, check the statement
 cegprakash: now lets say it's a 3x3 grid for simplicity instead of 15x15..
 cegprakash: enemy moves NE
 cegprakash: now what does ur map have
 MSmits: well i will have 9 states at first, because i dont know where he starts
 MSmits: but because he moved N and E some will be removed
 MSmits: top row
 MSmits: and left column
 MSmits: so there will be 4 states left
 MSmits: say i pick the one where he started bottom left
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6d768fd5-5a2b-464b-92df-ea06b2ff2ad1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6d768fd5-5a2b-464b-92df-ea06b2ff2ad1</a>
 MSmits: he will then be in the middle at 1,1
 eulerscheZahl: Grudo "game screen"? like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/uXHgaVh">https://imgur.com/a/uXHgaVh</a>&#160;?
 MSmits: so the visited map will be 
 MSmits: 000110100
 MSmits: for that state
 MSmits: and the positon is 1,1
 MSmits: it might also be at 2,1
 MSmits: with visited:
 MSmits: 000011010
 MSmits: or at 2,0
 MSmits: with visited:
 MSmits: 011010000
 MSmits: you get the idea
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/266407eb-2e6b-4d72-83b3-5af17fb11de1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/266407eb-2e6b-4d72-83b3-5af17fb11de1</a>
 cegprakash: sorry start positions
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats why there are 4 possible states, after those moves
 MSmits: the int x, int y in my state is the current position
 cegprakash: end positions will be0 1 10 1 10 0 0
 MSmits: correct
 cegprakash: is this what ur map will have?
 MSmits: no
 cegprakash: these end positions
 MSmits: my map  1 just 1 state
 cegprakash: but I want these
 MSmits: a visited map
 MSmits: ahhh
 cegprakash: I want0 1 10 1 10 0 0
 MSmits: then what you do is, you loop over all states, get the position and add it to  a amp
 MSmits: map
 MSmits: uint16_t[15] oppMap = { 0} 
 MSmits: easy&#160;:)
 cegprakash: in a 500 turn game, 83 silences can be used. But there can be atmost 6 surfaces
 cegprakash: because there are only 6 lives
 MSmits: right
 cegprakash: so I'm thinking of going with BFS with surface clear history
 cegprakash: for now
 cegprakash: that should work for bronze right?
 MSmits: do what you can manage
 cegprakash: yeah I don't understand what u say now.. and time is short
 MSmits: no idea what works for bronze, but you shouldnt need black magic to get to silver
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d2d46a47-d19e-4259-95aa-0d66a90f73cd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d2d46a47-d19e-4259-95aa-0d66a90f73cd</a>
 MSmits: right, that is indeed what you need for most logic
 MSmits: been trying CG bench tests vs darkhorse, euler, blaster, yannt and robo. 
 MSmits: [200 games] [31 crash(es)]
 MSmits: none of those crashes are mine
 Famout: So what happens when the timer is up, all code is lost and the contest vanishes? 
 YannT: MSmits: got to wonder how much of your rank is actually due to your timeouting opponent bots&#160;;)
 MSmits: some of it, for sure
 MSmits: but hey, anything I do to them, I do to myself. Selftracking is symmetrical&#160;:)
 MSmits: Famout code doesnt vanish
 MSmits: it becomes a multiplayer arena
 MSmits: you can continue to play
 MSmits: before this would take months before the arena was activated
 MSmits: supposedly it is faster now
 Famout: Neat, kinda turns into something like CSB then? 
 MSmits: csb was a contest also yes
 Quidome: Are all the leages recomputed at the end or only legend?
 andichin: hello guys
 MSmits: legend I think, but only top 100 of legend
 MSmits: not 100% sure of this
 Quidome: How is this with hiding or camping do you expect a lot of them surfacing the coming hours?
 MSmits: no, not a lot
 MSmits: at most 1 or 2, maybe 0
 Famout: Interesting, and good to know! Got a solid framework here, but now that I finally figured out how I am adding in tracking for my foe, I was worried I wouldn't have a chance to refine offense. 
 MSmits: some will be promoted out of gold ofc
 Quidome: Aha, ok, better
 MSmits: and some might be very good when they come out
 YannT: on this, I can't imagine someone managed to successfully hide a killer bot
 MSmits: but that is not necessarily hiding
 YannT: benching is so irregular
 Quidome: what is benching?
 YannT: they would have to try stuff on the ladder to be successful
 YannT: running matches offline
 MSmits: ch benchmark is a tool where you can run IDE games automatically
 MSmits: its not offline
 MSmits: just scripted
 MSmits: unless you mean brutaltester
 YannT: offline in that you don't submit your bot
 MSmits: which you definitely should not do for this game
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Quidome: It feels as bad sportmanship though
 YannT: it is
 MSmits: thats pretty much it
 MSmits: it's not cheating, but it is bad sportmanship
 Quidome: ok thnxs for the info
 YannT: and on this particular game, I don't think it will work too because you can't really have reliable testing without submitting
 Quidome: it will not affect me but was just curious
 MSmits: well if you really want to, you can make a very large cg bench
 MSmits: with 10 players in there or something
 Quidome: hm, some google neural network approach would work I think
 MSmits: a submit in itself is not accurate either
 MSmits: Quidome maybe, but it's not your typical game because of the information aspect.
 MSmits: sure you can use machine learning for one part of the game
 MSmits: the logic when you have some probabilities that came out of your tracking system
 MSmits: you can feed those to a NN
 YannT: it's very slow tho
 YannT: I think one condition for successfull hiding is that brutaltester can get relevant results (not the case with this game)
 MSmits: yea I think so
 YannT: it's the only tool that will let you have enough statistics to do everything offline
 MSmits: well it, or similar
 YannT: cgbench is nice but too slow to do everything with
 YannT: yeah or similar
 MSmits: you're better off writing your own arena of course
 MSmits: if you have the time
 MSmits: brutaltester is quite slow
 MSmits: sometimes I even let bots use eachothers resources when i write an arena
 cegprakash: MSmits I'm using set&lt;Poiint&gt; to remove duplicates hope it won't timeout 
 cegprakash: :D
 MSmits: good luck ceg
 MSmits: for my uttt meta mcts I actually have 1 bot that plays itself and uses a single tree to select moves
 MSmits: so p1 uses the tree to select a move, then p2 uses the same tree to select its move etc.
 MSmits: saves some resources
 MSmits: esp. memory
 cegprakash: should I clear enemy tail when he uses silence?
 MSmits: tail?
 cegprakash: his past moves
 Quidome: trail
 Quidome: yes
 MSmits: I don't
 cegprakash: that's why u are legend #20
 cegprakash: :D
 MSmits: but again, i use a fast system for this
 MSmits: well my real rank is 30 prolly
 MSmits: i'm a bit pushed up
 Quidome: clearing can save you states i think
 cegprakash: yeah Quidome is legend too.. I'm gonna respect him. and gonna try that
 cegprakash: :D
 MSmits: it does, but it also makes your tracking worse. It just depends on what your bot can handle
 cegprakash: because I don't know other options
 cegprakash: lul
 Quidome: Aha, yes I have a seperate mine probability field&#160;:)
 MSmits: Quidome is gold ceg
 Quidome: yep
 cegprakash: oh
 MSmits: which tbh is not that easy to get into also, this is some heavy competition because it last a month
 MSmits: you dont get into gold with a quick bot
 cegprakash: not even cegprakash?
 MSmits: well people who talk about themselves in the 3rd person can do anything really
 Quidome: 00:19:35:31
 Quidome: well I am out of here, good luck to you all for now
 MSmits: bye Quidome
 AntiSquid: finally triggered the captcha minigame
 AntiSquid: was totally missing it
 AntiSquid: my life is pain without
 MSmits: yes, you need the confirmation of not being a robot
 Nurutomo: before i wasnt
 Nurutomo: it*
 MSmits: ah
 gaspadorius: what does silence do?
 gaspadorius: or sonar?
 MSmits: for a moment there I thought you were goign to tell us you transplanted your mind into a machine Nurutomo
 AntiSquid: it prevents heroes from casting spells
 MSmits: villains too
 gaspadorius: ty
 AntiSquid: wrong game nvm
 AntiSquid: was joking gaspadorius but the answer is in the statement, one must read it to unlock its knowledge
 MSmits: gnawlesh is powwah
 eulerscheZahl: robo up to 23 again, was around 50 this morning. didn't submit for 2 days.i don't understand the ranking
 MSmits: if you dont, then noone does
 eulerscheZahl: and i felt like locam was random
 MSmits: that was similarly random though
 MSmits: you were just ranked a little bit higher
 MSmits: well +10 or so
 AntiSquid: i feel like this is the worst, but then i only vaguley remember the previous ones
 eulerscheZahl: i was top20? when? (took a nap)
 eulerscheZahl: or is +10 = 36 then?
 MSmits: in locam you were top 20 most of the time and very unlucky on the last day
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: i thought you were talking about OOC
 MSmits: I was saying ooc and locam had the same random spread, but your random spread in ooc + 10 = your random spread in locam
 MSmits: just everything 10 higher
 eulerscheZahl: ah, now i get it
 MSmits: wouldnt say you did worse here though, it's like 3x more participants
 MSmits: started working on onitama
 MSmits: done with occ
 MSmits: ooc
 MSmits: still running some cg bench but it's mostly lists of you, yannt and darkhorse timing out :P
 MSmits: not that helpful
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not surprised as i have my own timeout stats
 eulerscheZahl: i had 4 timeouts in the last submit that i analyzed
 eulerscheZahl: and always silence spam related
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't know if or when i should use sonar
 eulerscheZahl: any suggestion?
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm not happy with my own silence usage (when+where)
 cegprakash: check my IDE code eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: before I subit
 cegprakash: it has lot of sonars used
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that your bot is a good reference
 cegprakash: I only sonar when the information from the sonar is useful to fire the enemy
 cegprakash: it looks obvious but it'sn ot
 eulerscheZahl: hm, that even sounds somewhat promising
 AntiSquid: how do you decide it's useful&#160;?
 cegprakash: useful in the next immediate turn
 cegprakash: to be more precise
 eulerscheZahl: my current attempts were just reducing the amount of possible candidates. but if i just sonar too early, it reduces those candidates that would eliminate on their own in a few turns
 AntiSquid: i guess it's maybe good if you have 2 groups of paths
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i charge and use sonar only if there more then two sectors, it can be late some times, i.e to the time sonar chrged there is only one sector, but i found it to be more appropriate 
 cegprakash: how do I escape from pond? is it possible to silence out off a pond?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't spawn in a pond
 AntiSquid: same as escaping from a fountain
 AntiSquid: don't jump in there
 AntiSquid: i meant well
 wlesavo: lol, i had to google pond
 eulerscheZahl: lake
 cegprakash: I did spawn in pond in many maps eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: that that's what to change
 eulerscheZahl: find the biggest lake and spawn there
 eulerscheZahl: BFS
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: we are the ones chosing the spawn
 cegprakash: I forgot that
 cegprakash: lolol
 NormantasStankevicius: xd
 AntiSquid: lololol
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid finish him!
 AntiSquid: who&#160;?
 kovi: he cant he is on another lake
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/635ac50c-ae9b-4fa5-9338-5c7578010922">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/635ac50c-ae9b-4fa5-9338-5c7578010922</a>
 cegprakash: my spawn algo s**ks
 Badzio69k: Can you give me a hint to 1D bush fire?
 eulerscheZahl: even with infinite recursion possible
 eulerscheZahl: there's a greedy solution Badzio69k
 wlesavo: im kinda glad the contest is over in a day, because i wont have to feel bad for not working on my code, which was the case for almost two weeks now
 eulerscheZahl: always make sure that you extinguish the first fire and as many behind as possible with a single action
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds depressing wlesavo
 AntiSquid: sounds like he is trying to rub it in
 eulerscheZahl: for locam i skipped the first 2 weeks on purpose to avoid such a situation
 Grudo: cegprakash our last 4 duels results 2/2 :D
 wlesavo: euler i want to improove it, but have not much motivation neither really good ideas, and its kinda hanging back on my mind even though i tried couple of other multis and codejam problems in the mean time
 wlesavo: i think ill read some pms for good ideas afterwards
 wlesavo: dont know if i deserve to write one though :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: you clearly don't /s
 darkhorse64: wlesavo: after making so many people suffer on top gold, we deserve a PM
 AntiSquid: ya
 eulerscheZahl: check old forum threads, lots of post mortems
 eulerscheZahl: even players stuck in silver write them sometimes
 AntiSquid: even some posts from wood players complaining they got stuck lol
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair top players usually get the most upvotes on their analysis
 eulerscheZahl: there are different types of post mortems:
 wlesavo: AntiSquid lol
 eulerscheZahl: 1. the analysis and description of the algo to solve the problem
 eulerscheZahl: 2. the story teller. "i was right below the boss when i went to bed but still not promoted the next day"
 darkhorse64: Your contrib matters because your bot is Python based and necessarily don't rely only on heavy computations. There should be some smartness in it
 eulerscheZahl: 3. the angry user complaining that the rules are bad
 eulerscheZahl: of course you can combine these types
 AntiSquid: ya imagine your approach got taken and adapted into a faster language wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: my post mortem will probably just be some statistics this time as i really don't know what else to write
 eulerscheZahl: track opponent: checkheuristic bot: check
 wlesavo: stats would be awesome
 kovi: 4. latecomer....others have covered all the basic features, so here are some minor ideas/improvements
 AntiSquid: so how to achieve good story teller status in post mortem?
 eulerscheZahl: read unihedron or the user whos nick i forgot or ranarama
 AntiSquid: i like the pictures some post
 AntiSquid: kodel or whatever his name is
 eulerscheZahl: blitz prog
 eulerscheZahl: (the story teller)
 AntiSquid: i need to post a picture too :D
 AntiSquid: hand drawn in paint
 eulerscheZahl: sharing an animation is on my TODO as well
 kovi: duh, pb4 resubmit....just when i was getting closerwith so many other submissions it is hard to tell the status anyway
 eulerscheZahl: easy way to collect some upvotes :D
 darkhorse64: How do you see the size of your bot in the IDE&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i only check locally
 eulerscheZahl: 54.6 kB
 cegprakash: how many lines of code eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: 1439
 AntiSquid: 46kb O_O
 eulerscheZahl: but that includes some debug code and map drawing
 AntiSquid: O__O
 -ac: Hello Hello, May I ask is anyone meet CGInterview question about memory leak here&#160;?)???
 darkhorse64: 2k, 50ko
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl that animation of your local visualiser would totally make sence
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl sorry was gone. I use silence when the selftracking count drops below some value and when silence itself increases the selftracking count by some minimal value. Sonar is only used when nothing else is allowed to be used
 eulerscheZahl: that animation will be past of my short post mortem
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like we have the same sonar usage
 MSmits: yeah, i often see it charge by 3 points during a game, never finishing
 MSmits: btw, i just set my torpedo threshold to some lower value in cg bench so it more easily starts shooting and you never time out then euler
 eulerscheZahl: because that simplifies my tracking
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: why are you even benching against me?
 MSmits: i dunno, i just picked 5 people spread out over the board
 MSmits: i dont know these other fellas
 MSmits: also picked robo, darkhorse etc.
 eulerscheZahl: my winrate vs top and bottom players doesn't even differ that much
 eulerscheZahl: i have a hard time at the beginning of my submits
 MSmits: i just need a baseline to see if any of these changes in constants do anything
 MSmits: but they dont do much =/
 MSmits: either that or I guessed them all right at the start
 MSmits: I often dont get much benefit out of parameter fitting. Only in oware did it help me a lot. Other games it didnt reall
 Nerchio: i think you usually need a couple of submits to actually see a difference ;p
 AntiSquid: lol ^
 eulerscheZahl: he's playing lots of games in the IDE (automated)
 AntiSquid: a lifetime might not be enough with this game
 MSmits: true
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452599202">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452599202</a> Mines should destructible
 dbdr: arg, timeouting at turn 1
 darkhorse64: *be*
 dbdr: I suppose it's compilation timeout?
 dbdr: pb4 had that problem, right?
 WINWINWIN: why are there so many resubmits on the last day?
 darkhorse64: wait for the last hours. It will be frantic
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse64 in the original game they are, we screwed up but didn't want to change it mid-contest&#160;:(
 WINWINWIN: xD
 kovi: might be interesting to see in multi
 WINWINWIN: What happens to the code after contest?
 kovi: (to add some new flavour and not collection of postemortem copypastes)
 WINWINWIN: do I have to save a copy?
 darkhorse64: I know that and I cannot blame you. The lesson is that any power shoud have its counter
 eulerscheZahl: will break a lot of bots of players that will never return&#160;:(
 Swagboy: What was the way to destroy them in original concept&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: silence is the counter to mines
 eulerscheZahl: and surface as a last ressort
 eulerscheZahl: shoot them
 AntiSquid: would have been more fun
 AntiSquid: you detect enemy in between his own mines, shoot randomly explode everything 
 Swagboy: Oh funny to shoot them
 Swagboy: Were there chain explosion also haha&#160;?
 MSmits: lots of frames then
 AntiSquid: but if you lay a mine you also need to move away from them then
 darkhorse64: In the original, you destroy mines but they don't do damages, I believe
 AntiSquid: otherwise it's worth to take a random shot every time enemy lays a mine
 AntiSquid: everyone needs to change their bot if the game changes
 eulerscheZahl: no chain explosions
 Swagboy:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: I just added spawn location fix
 eulerscheZahl: that was a mistake in the last russian AI cup: you could explode mines by shooting them (not just remove but trigger)
 cegprakash: also fixed a bug where I only shoot exactly on enemy position I can shoot his neighbors as well
 darkhorse64: Chain explosions with so little information on mine layout would make the game random
 eulerscheZahl: so people got as close to the opponent as possible and then did a kamikaze
 wlesavo: yeah, i dont wanna touch my mine tracking ever again, imagine mine tracking would change completely
 eulerscheZahl: they deal more damage to the opponent than the other way, so they win
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo as you are russian: did you ever play russian AI cup?
 AntiSquid: imo that was one of the few redeeming things about RAIC, but they done the change mid contest i think
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/452612633">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/452612633</a> what am I doing wrong
 cegprakash: got rekt in 40 turns
 eulerscheZahl: the meta just got completely dull because of this
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, was introduced mid contest, at the end of beta mode
 wlesavo: euler not really, i basically started programming last year or so, i had some background but not competitive, this year on CG i wrote more then my whole life i believe
 eulerscheZahl: ceg :D
 eulerscheZahl: i boss made a lucky guess about your position
 eulerscheZahl: the boss*
 eulerscheZahl: wow impressive wlesavo :o
 cegprakash: I hate lucky
 cegprakash: when I die
 eulerscheZahl: let me know if it gets too personal: do you work? or are you a student?
 cegprakash: me?
 cegprakash: I work
 eulerscheZahl: not you
 eulerscheZahl: i know that you work. and that you studied at CEG
 wlesavo: its fine :slight_smile: i finished phd in condensed matter, thinking about switching to programming but not completely sure yet to what area of it
 eulerscheZahl: and that your name is prakash
 wlesavo: got my phd in november'19
 cegprakash: I want to implement anti lucky strat
 cegprakash: counter lucky
 cegprakash: can someone help
 eulerscheZahl: fresh enough to congratulate you
 AntiSquid: condensed matter? 
 AntiSquid: what are the job prospects for that?
 eulerscheZahl: that's a very technical wikipedia article, i might even switch to German to understand what it's about
 darkhorse64: cegprakash: implementing a proper tracking system will help you survive lucky strikes
 wlesavo: thx, not an easy way for sure, experimental physics in russia  is almost dead, but i even got 2 papers in scientific reports, quite lucky for the state science in russia is right now
 cegprakash: darkhorse64 u mean like run away from enemy?
 AntiSquid: is it only solid matter wlesavo&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: solid+liquid
 AntiSquid: google gave a definition mentioning solid
 Astrobytes: Condensed matter covers more than just solid 
 wlesavo: AntiSquid worldwide actually it is ok, basically its a very general area, including quantum computers and spintronics and stuff like that
 AntiSquid: ya was first thinking about quantum computer chips when i read that because of the complicated process they use to build them
 AntiSquid: but where do you apply&#160;?
 AntiSquid: what do YOU want to do?
 wlesavo: its an area of physics that studies mostly ordered states of the matter, there are magnetism and low temperatures involved, and most of progress the technology made last 50 years is basically condensed matter physic
 Astrobytes: Exciting field to work in
 AntiSquid: cold fusion, zero friction dunno what you aim for :p
 AntiSquid: what happened to podkletnov anyway&#160;?
 wlesavo: as for me i dont really want to do that anymore, it was fun while it lasted
 AntiSquid: but you just graduated lol
 wlesavo: basically i worked in the field for 7 years
 AntiSquid: good you didn't go for a doctor's degree&#160;?
 wlesavo: the process of graduation was not that fast as it could be :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: i mean they study 10 years +
 wlesavo: i did
 Astrobytes: You have limited options after that, usually the only thing to do is stay in academia - research. Not for everyone. Most people I know with PhDs no longer work in research.
 wlesavo: phd that is
 AntiSquid: i mean actual doctor
 wlesavo: i studied like for 11 years, most of which worked in a lab
 wlesavo: Astrobytes same, most people i know who even leaved russia no longer work in research 
 AntiSquid: what would you do instead
 AntiSquid: also with the lockdown not much to pick from anyway
 wlesavo: programming i guess, there are other possibilities, but this i really enjoy
 eulerscheZahl: it won't be like that forever
 eulerscheZahl: i mean the lockdown
 AntiSquid: ofc not, just a long time
 eulerscheZahl: not the joy of coding
 wlesavo: lol
 AntiSquid: make android games slap some ads on it and publish
 eulerscheZahl: but i fear that it will take a while too. saw an estimation for germany: if we want to keep the curve flat enough not to overload hospitals, we have to keep going for about a year
 MSmits: corona makes me use all my free time for coding, as opposed to what i did before.... use all my free time for coding
 AntiSquid: UK plans to go for 2022 i think
 AntiSquid: and continue brexit plans :D
 MSmits: well... the effect of brexit on the UK economy may as well be negligible compared to what this virus does
 wlesavo: i just like the idea that i can make stuff happen with just a computer, opposed to highly consumable experimental devices, and im not smart enough for theoretical work 
 AntiSquid: if no lockdown would mean extra brexit with cream and cherry on top they'd go for it starting now
 eulerscheZahl: and you can easily distribute your work, make it available for others
 Astrobytes: Yeah AntiSquid, "the coronavirus crisis shows how important it is to break regulatory alignment with the EU" was a quote that chilled me somewhat
 MSmits: it makes no sense either
 AntiSquid: it's a religion
 Astrobytes: Fanaticism at the very least yes
 MSmits: if there's something wrong with EU regulations, then try to change that
 Astrobytes: No, they want the whole race-to-the-bottom stuff, deregulation, more power for corporations
 wlesavo: euler, true, also community and easy to understand docs/litterature, opposed to academic papers 
 AntiSquid: not all laws are the same anyway
 MSmits: that would mean that all but 1 are redundant
 AntiSquid: so virus is perfect for that Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: the virus helps to obfuscate the harm caused by Brexit
 Astrobytes: Can be used as a partial smokescreen yes
 Astrobytes: Utterly sickening imo.
 AntiSquid: but brexit needs to be dee-liver-d
 AntiSquid: astro are you still doing contest at all?
 AntiSquid: nvm i see now
 Astrobytes: Some half-hearted submits. I fcked up my bot, then reverted back to a bugged old version and trying to salvage what I can
 AntiSquid: thought you quit it for good
 AntiSquid: my best bot is 6 version before the latest&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: I might rewrite it after the contest
 Astrobytes: But there's loads of games&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: is this the most exciting one?
 Astrobytes: This was a good game, annoying, but good. Donno about exciting
 eulerscheZahl: takes some time to set up
 eulerscheZahl: parse opponent actions, write a tracker
 eulerscheZahl: only then you can concentrate on actually playing the game
 Astrobytes: With hindsight, I should have started once I'd recovered from the virus, as that's when I messed up a lot
 AntiSquid: imagine you want to also write a sim :p
 Swagboy: Realized yesterday that my tracker wasn't optimal
 eulerscheZahl: and now i give you an extra idea to use self-tracking to track your opponent
 eulerscheZahl: when the opponent knows where you are and doesn't trigger a mine, it's because there is no mine
 AntiSquid: 400 people in gold ... the submits should be run within a smaller range not the entire league 
 Swagboy: Sure, I wanted to implement a belief updating also
 Swagboy: His best move would be to go N, he goes S so he is likely not there
 eulerscheZahl: good point, at least for some situations
 eulerscheZahl: no self-trapping
 Swagboy: Yes for example
 Swagboy: Or torpedo, like for mines
 eulerscheZahl: but too much effort to code all of that
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just wait for pacman
 Swagboy: Hehe, not sure I'll go for another in less than a month
 AntiSquid: still fishy it got taken down
 AntiSquid: expecting pacman game .
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, the reaction surprised me too
 eulerscheZahl: i even PMed thibaud about your contribution earlier. he said it's not the contest
 Swagboy: What has got taken down?
 eulerscheZahl: but why did he take it offline then? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: you told me
 eulerscheZahl: squiddy found a game on pending contributions
 eulerscheZahl: a pacman multiplayer by julien from CG staff
 AntiSquid: my only guess is maybe they got paid to make it but there is an issue with the contract or didn't receive the pay? something like the contract with crystal rush&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: offline shortly after
 Swagboy: Hmm ok
 eulerscheZahl: but squiddy downloaded the game and made a reupload as a private draft
 AntiSquid: was sat there for 2 years or so i think
 eulerscheZahl: it was a pacman game and we have a pacman contest soon
 eulerscheZahl: not 2 years. community contributions are only a thing for a bit more than 1 year
 AntiSquid: but i didn't make it public 
 AntiSquid: just shared link
 Swagboy: Find it a bit disappointing to know so precisely the theme one month before
 eulerscheZahl: feb 19th 2019 (maybe i downloaded the squiddy contribution)
 AntiSquid: well you have a cover picture, what else do you expect&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and the name in the title&#160;?
 AntiSquid: definitely uploaded earlier than that
 eulerscheZahl: feb 11th, failed to remember when switching virtual screens
 AntiSquid: how's your codejam btw?
 Swagboy: It'll most likely be close to the pacman game, hence you already know what the game will look like
 eulerscheZahl: starts in 90min
 Swagboy: Not like if it was some random contest name
 AntiSquid: maybe you are the ghost  and you need to catch pacmans!
 Astrobytes: Pac to the Code
 AntiSquid: Ghostman
 Astrobytes: Coders Strike Pac!
 Swagboy: Haha right, interesting
 eulerscheZahl: so far i didn't even read all the rules. no way for you to check but i don't plan to get an advantage on this
 MSmits: Pacalath!
 eulerscheZahl: and it's 1 year old, lots of rules changes or redesigns might have happened
 Astrobytes: Yavaman
 AntiSquid: might be a slight difference in this game
 eulerscheZahl: ultimate pacman
 MSmits: Pacthrough
 Astrobytes: Pacwoman
 MSmits: that's just mrs. pacman
 eulerscheZahl: the great pacman
 AntiSquid: Fudge Packers of the Galaxy
 Astrobytes: ffs
 kovi: mr and mrs pacman
 Astrobytes: Pacman &amp; Friends
 AntiSquid: Russian Pacman AI cup
 eulerscheZahl: pacman4life
 eulerscheZahl: packers (instead of checkers)
 AntiSquid: Call of Pacman
 MSmits: Pac Norris
 AntiSquid: MPacmits
 wlesavo: winrarman
 MSmits: now we're derailing :P
 AntiSquid: you derailed it
 MSmits: meh ok
 MSmits: I was supposed to do DnD today
 MSmits: DM got sick
 AntiSquid: hope it's a tiny caricature like the one in your avatar running away from the ghosts with its hands stretched forward
 MSmits: that sounds cool AntiSquid
 wlesavo: MSmits bad roll?
 MSmits: someone did suggest he should roll higher on his disease check
 MSmits: first question everyone asks is, is it corona? But of course noone can know this 
 MSmits: only when you've been sick for a while and actually get tested
 MSmits: I wonder what the chances are now, to get corona as opposed to other viruses. The less infectious viruses should mostly die out now shouldnt they? With the social distancing
 MSmits: so if you get sick now, there's not much chance of having gotten those
 MSmits: ordinary flu and such
 MSmits: Astrobytes will know this
 Astrobytes: Hey I'm no epidemiologist
 Febrin: Somebody has an idea what could caused that my game loop did 2 iterations in one round?
 kovi: you write end of line
 kovi: maybe
 MSmits: allright, me neither, was just wondering&#160;:)
 Febrin: Oh yea I think it is for sure in this spaghetti mess
 abhay_RAJ: any american?
 Astrobytes: But MSmits, since the coronavirus infection rate is likely to be *much* higher than currently known, it is more likely to get it yes. And the seasonal 'flu's and such are dying out now anyway.
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but apart from it being seasonal, it should die out even faster
 MSmits: and any other virus should die out faster as well
 Astrobytes: Increased distancing and more diligence wrt hygiene should decrease transmission of many yes, depends on the environment
 cegprakash: is it a tie if nobody dies? say opponent has 4 lives and I have 2 lives
 Astrobytes: He wins
 Astrobytes: If you both have equal lives, it's a tie
 eulerscheZahl: "Victory ConditionsHave more lifes than your enemy at the end of the game."
 wlesavo: hm, i though the timer of contest became red to match the league color, and only now noticed that it is slightly more intensive, so its color in fact indicating remaining time  
 Astrobytes: Come on euler, you don't expect ceg to have read that do you? :D
 eulerscheZahl: it will start blinking the last 6h
 eulerscheZahl: actually i do: RTFM
 eulerscheZahl: zarthaxx stop hiding
 ZarthaxX: wish i was
 ZarthaxX: i just dont understand this game
 eulerscheZahl: RTFM
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: what does it have to do
 eulerscheZahl: torpedo = bad. except if you shoot it. then torpedo=good
 wlesavo: except if you shoot it in yourself
 eulerscheZahl: no spoilers!
 cegprakash: I am just submitting my enemyTracker and enemy avoidance
 Astrobytes: Thank you for the update ceg
 eulerscheZahl: just get ready for codejam in 1h
 ZarthaxX: thanks for the advice eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: didnt thought of that
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't even for you :D
 ZarthaxX: the torpedo thing
 cegprakash: I only replace my move with silence for now. I don't know how to use silence with multiple steps
 cegprakash: like when and why
 eulerscheZahl: to kill
 cegprakash: i currently run away from enemy
 eulerscheZahl: check the ending ceg <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/452666205">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/452666205</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's how to use silence to your advantage
 cegprakash: I see mines
 Astrobytes: lol, sneaky
 eulerscheZahl: last frame
 cegprakash: wow
 cegprakash: the killing blow
 eulerscheZahl: you should add this to your bot
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes you don't even have to know the exact location to go for the kill
 ZarthaxX: why a replay smacking me
 ZarthaxX: smack ceg
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 eulerscheZahl: was the first i could find where this worked
 eulerscheZahl: last battles, you submitted
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: :P
 eulerscheZahl: and i can't find ceg, below top1000
 eulerscheZahl: getting some food before codejam, see you
 ZarthaxX: cya
 cegprakash: rank #15 60%
 AntiSquid: please don't
 Astrobytes: we'll have 16 hours of this you know
 AntiSquid: no we won't
 Astrobytes: ceg doesn't sleep on the last day of contest
 cegprakash: do mines dominate legend league?
 cegprakash: plz show me a replay that's good at mining
 cegprakash: plz
 pb4: cegprakash&#160;: no
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: I saw eulerscheZahl use a lot of mines
 pb4: Legend league&#160;: per game you'll lose 0.5 lives from mines, 3 from torpedoes, 1.5 from surface
 pb4: Obviously this means you need to avoid mines, so yes, they are hugely important 
 dbdr: pb4: did you completely solve your compilation timeout issues?
 pb4: as I said, removed a bunch of code and functionnalities and pragmas
 pb4: and yes those went away
 pb4: but any feature i add needs to replace an old one&#160;:(
 dbdr: cool. I wonder if server load might fluctuate and affect those
 dbdr: yeah, that sucks
 cegprakash: I'm doing a binary search to find which turn my bot bugged it's tracking
 icecream17: Red timer... 56th....
 cegprakash: what.. SILENCE 0 is allowed?
 cegprakash: :O
 cegprakash: I can use that
 icecream17: No, people shoot at the silence 0 anyway
 icecream17: (Well, actually, I silenced 0 for quite awhile)
 icecream17: Why did I say this information? (Sigh. Nevermind)
 tobk: weird, sometimes just out of the blue my bot is timeouting. no error message, so I guess it's a "real" timeout, but my regular execution time by turn is well below 50ms... :confused:
 dbdr: tobk does it happen on turn 1?
 tobk: no, but often early in the game
 dbdr: what language?
 tobk: Python. e.g. here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452682846">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452682846</a>
 dbdr: then I don't know
 dbdr: sometimes it's a good idea to print something short early on to make sure the bot is running at all
 dbdr: but more relevant for turn 1 and 2
 tobk: do you mean for debugging, or to make sure the bot does not timeout?
 tobk: (e.g. print some no-op MSG; but i'd have to terminate it with a newline, so how would that work?)
 dbdr: 70% of the top 20 is in submit right now :D
 dbdr: I meant to print to sys.tderr
 dbdr: sometimes the bot does not even start because it's a CG error
 dbdr: if you see your message, you ruled that out
 MSmits: ohh, i should submit too then
 tobk: yeah, I do lots of debug-output already, but none of that shown in the last offending turn, not even stuff that should have been completed well before timeouting
 dbdr: gogogo MSmits&#160;:)
 dbdr: join the party
 MSmits: it's on!
 dbdr: \o/
 dbdr: good start&#160;;)
 MSmits: typo :P
 dbdr: hm?
 MSmits: changed a constant, made a typo
 MSmits: 1,0f
 dbdr: ah yes, not a real win
 dbdr: you ignored the warning dialog from CG I see :D
 MSmits: whats that
 dbdr: "You did not test your code..."
 MSmits: oh right, yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i ignore that too :D
 MSmits: new constant not looking good so far
 eulerscheZahl: but usually i compile it offline at least
 MSmits: I'm beeting creapy rabbit at least
 MSmits: creepy
 ZarthaxX: creepy rabbit lmao
 wlesavo: tobk you sure its not related to placing mine around a board edge?
 dbdr: that should say something else than timeout
 dbdr: if the referee rejects it
 wlesavo: you can also use flush = true to see if its a real timeout
 eulerscheZahl: creepy rabbit = nagraro k
 dbdr: why?
 MSmits: no it's this guy:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/93dcae21630961cf6a73b3215d64a8e11974473">https://www.codingame.com/profile/93dcae21630961cf6a73b3215d64a8e11974473</a>
 tobk: wlesavo Pretty sure. If it was some weird edge-case, it should be reproducible at least.
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 wlesavo: hm
 eulerscheZahl: i thought you said that nagra looks like a bunny in the small viewer
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: this guy is creepy because you only see he is creepy when you focus on the little pic
 eulerscheZahl: 10min to codejam
 MSmits: at first you think, ahhh cute bunny, then you zoom in, it's like WTH
 wlesavo: i finally got an idea for improvement, just 10 min before codejam :slight_smile: i guess there is still a night
 eulerscheZahl: and my cat just entered the room
 eulerscheZahl: why now?&#160;:/
 dbdr: 16 hours wlesavo
 dbdr: not even flashing yet
 eulerscheZahl: the last 6h will be intense UI-wise
 wlesavo: probably wont have time tommorow, so its night or never
 dbdr: flash is like 6 hours?
 kovi: pb4 has solid lead...
 dbdr: *last
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: kovi are you sure it's solid?
 kovi: well, his winrate is decisive vs. me
 wlesavo: i think this one thing can actually make a difference, although obivously it can make it worse as always
 eulerscheZahl: but losing to val growth
 Nerchio: i can't work on my bot anymore i burned out on this challenge ;p
 ZarthaxX: wanna play chess Nerchio
 ZarthaxX: kidding
 ZarthaxX: lets go outside and workout.. oh wait
 Nerchio: lol
 Nerchio: i am not bad at chess actually but also got bored with it :D
 ZarthaxX: i dont like it mmh
 Nerchio: when you get slightly good memorizing openings is too important :p
 icecream17: A huge bug! What a miracle
 Astrobytes: Try Chess960/Fischer Random, more about playing chess than openings
 icecream17: theres Crazyhouse....
 Nerchio: when i am programming a lot i find that mental exercises outside are exhausting more than fun so no chess
 icecream17: hmm... what fun game uses no mental excersize....
 Astrobytes: Yes, true for me sometimes too Nerchio
 tobk: is there something better than "time.time()" in Python? seems not to be very precise...
 Nerchio: msmits timeout again xD
 MSmits: not on my current submit. I made a mistake earlier
 tobk: or put differently:if the output is correct, then just reading the input per turn already takes 20-50ms... and sometimes the bot takes longer than 50ms without timeouting
 icecream17: I wonder if the website starts the 50ms timeout timer before the code starts, or just after?
 Febrin: I just realised i have random timeouts too, (I'm using time.time())
 Febrin: And sometimes It says that my move lasted 3ms which is impossible
 tobk: ah, wait, I guess I'm including the Opp's runtime in my timing...
 tobk: I set the "start" time for the turn right at the top of the game loop, before reading the first input. guess I should put it just after the first input instead
 Astrobytes: tobk make sure you start the timer immediately after you read the first input
 tobk: exactly&#160;:-D
 Astrobytes: :D
 tobk: yes, now the readouts make a lot more sense. no more 30ms for input parsing.
 Astrobytes: lol
 tobk: (my bot does not do any "until time permits" stuff, but it was kind of confusing anyway)
 MadKnight: who is Automaton2020 and who made him&#160;?
 TidyMaze: it's actually Magus pretending to be a bot
 WINWINWIN: 'pretending'&#160;?
 MadKnight: 2020, not 2000 TidyMaze
 icecream17: Hey, Automaton2000, is that true?
 Automaton2000: i feel like there's a lot to me
 TidyMaze: I have no idea MadKnight but I like the Mechanical Turk profile picture
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 created it so he stops getting pinged 24/7
 Automaton2000: it depends on how you define it
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/</a> Great examples
 Automaton2000: on this, i can't imagine someone managed to successfully hide a killer bot
 icecream17: Hey... I just noticed something....
 icecream17: auTOMATOn2000 XD
 Automaton2000: i have a question for you
 Quidome: automaton2000 is a chatbot????
 Automaton2000: i should be able to find it
 icecream17: in my for loop.... i = -13???
 AntiSquid: Quidome no, read above tidymace already said it's magus playing as a bot in chat, that's why he isn't on the leaderboard, can't do both, no time
 cegprakash: You have been promoted to Silver League of "Ocean of Code"!
 cegprakash: codejam is hard

 Badzio69k: can you tell me what is wrong with it?
 Badzio69k: It is bank Robbers quest
 NormantasStankevicius: hellyeah! added a tracking function
 NormantasStankevicius: on opponent mine trigger
 NormantasStankevicius: he had like 30places
 NormantasStankevicius: 1 mine made into 1
 cegprakash: can I get a replay against a legend player plz
 cegprakash: in ocean of code
 cegprakash: I've reached silver.. I want to aim legend to reach gold
 Febrin: You can watch them in leaderboard
 cegprakash: me vs legend guy
 NormantasStankevicius: cegprakash took me a week to get out of silver, that place is a meat grinder
 Febrin: You can't play vs legend
 Febrin: Try to beat 1st bot first
 Idleless: @Badzio69k The problem is that there are more vaults than robbers so at least one robber will have to crack more than one vault and his time will be the sum of the vaults he cracks.
 cegprakash: I already beat silver boss
 Febrin: Okay, so try gold one then

 cegprakash: interesting radars
 cegprakash: sonars*
 cegprakash: but u have bugs with ur mine trigger
 cegprakash: should I try random combination of moves?
 cegprakash: for now I always do Torpedo + Move/Silence 
 cegprakash: no mines and no sonars
 cegprakash: it's time for me to do GA
 cegprakash: ceGA

 Astrobytes: How was codejame eulerscheZahl?
 Astrobytes: *codejame
 Astrobytes: *CODEJAM
 eulerscheZahl: 58 out of 100 points
 eulerscheZahl: should be enough
 eulerscheZahl: still going 30min
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl I reached Silver
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash you forgot codejam
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: I gave up
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 cegprakash: tough probs
 cegprakash: couldn't even solve 1st
 eulerscheZahl: i liked them
 cegprakash: so closed
 cegprakash: my code gave WA for the smallest input
 cegprakash:&#160;:')
 cegprakash: I did bfs
 eulerscheZahl: even if i didn't solve the large case for B and C
 eulerscheZahl: so now you think you can do a better BFS on CG?
 cegprakash: no first problem
 eulerscheZahl: there's a nice trick (as usually)
 eulerscheZahl: i'd love to tell you but have to wait 30 min
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: I know something exists in the line of bitmask or something
 cegprakash: but f**k it
 cegprakash: lets do CG
 cegprakash: get Gold
 cegprakash: I've reached Silver
 eulerscheZahl: do you have the killer move i showed you?
 cegprakash: just going to Add GA
 eulerscheZahl: 14h before the end?
 cegprakash: and simulation
 eulerscheZahl: bad idea
 AntiSquid: go cegprakash get legend
 AntiSquid: don't listen to haters
 cegprakash: u are the only hater I have AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: add GA, sim and linear regression
 AntiSquid: i don't hate you
 Riyuk: :joy:
 cegprakash: I don't know linear regression
 AntiSquid: JUST DO IT!
 MSmits: just draw a straight line that properly goes through a bunch of points
 MSmits: minimize the distance of the points to this line

 cegprakash: :D 
 cegprakash: line could be enemy possible positions
 cegprakash: sorry points
 eulerscheZahl: you need a troll detector cegprakash
 cegprakash: and in the line I throw a torpedo?
 Astrobytes: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: you are lucky, i still have one that i could sell you
 cegprakash: sell what
 cegprakash: a joke?
 tobk: just realized that my code for this contest is twice as long as any other of my contest or MP code so far... guess it's about time it's over
 cegprakash: how many LOC tobk
 cegprakash: I'm only half the size of what I wrote for other contests. May be I'm too far from legend or gold
 tobk: 520 in Python (guess that's still very low compared with others)
 Nerchio: wtf
 Nerchio: i have 2700

 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash as codejam is over now: i used a BFS for the last problem. to bruteforce the easy version
 cegprakash: u mean first problem?
 cegprakash: I only read first problem
 cegprakash: the stick jumping
 eulerscheZahl: last problem, the card stack
 cegprakash: I din read that
 eulerscheZahl: the pogo had to do with binary representation, true
 eulerscheZahl: but not really a bitmask
 AntiSquid: how long was codejam?
 AntiSquid: nvm found
 cegprakash: it's not a bfs eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: you try to find a sum of numbers adding up to abs(x)+abs(y)
 AntiSquid: so i had to qualify on 3rd of april to participate today?
 eulerscheZahl: that always works, if x+y is odd
 eulerscheZahl: yes AntiSquid. good luck next year
 AntiSquid: lol
 ZarthaxX: did u pass toad'
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX did you play?
 ZarthaxX: nope
 ZarthaxX: dont feeling it

 eulerscheZahl: yes ZarthaxX, #680
 ZarthaxX: niceee
 ZarthaxX: was it easy? lol
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid which i lack&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i was quite relaxed. didn't try too hard on those i couldn't solve :P
 AntiSquid: how comes you wait about a month for next round?

 eulerscheZahl: so codejam shall last for months
 AntiSquid: i never buy a calendar
 eulerscheZahl: me neither. but my mom always did when i was young
 AntiSquid: would probably eat it in one day
 MostComplicatedUsername: eat it?
 MostComplicatedUsername: oh chocolate
 MostComplicatedUsername: not calendar
 wlesavo: &gt;the pogo had to do with binary representation, truethought of that but could not make it in time, went with a simple brute forse and still screwed up somewhere
 wolf-555: does this game have bots?
 AntiSquid: which one
 MSmits: there's many games here wolf-555, most have bots yes
 MSmits: that's the point
 wolf-555: @AntiSquid COC
 wolf-555: okay
 MSmits: oh coc
 MSmits: thats a bit different
 MSmits: the bots arent actual bots, they are just copying a players earlier solution
 MSmits: so you're still playing against a player, but asynchronously
 ZarthaxX: *smart bots*
 wolf-555: uh cool
 MSmits: the bots exist to fill up the roster so you can play
 sharkdog: Is there any leaderboard system for coc?

 Zenoscave: ranked #1 at a point
 MSmits: Zenoscave is the cocmaster
 Counterbalance: no-one's going to mention the D
 wlesavo: puzzle race sounds fun
 MSmits: it was just to prove he is faster&#160;:)
 MSmits: he is&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: lol he's the puzzle master
 wlesavo: puzzle racer
 MSmits: he used to be twice as fast as I am, It's probably closer to 70% faster now
 MostComplicatedUsername: um
 MSmits: I got a bit better
 MSmits: not that we did any good measurement, but just judging from what I have seen
 Astrobytes: Are we still talking about cocs?
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: you could always race here MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play.typeracer.com/">https://play.typeracer.com/</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: Sigh
 MostComplicatedUsername: Children
 AntiSquid: woah!
 AntiSquid: and how old are you darling?
 ZarthaxX: 80
 Zenoscave: I turn 25 in june
 reCurse: Just looked up the D zealots for fun
 reCurse: They solved 6 and 4 puzzles respectively
 reCurse: :clap:
 Zenoscave: yikes
 MostComplicatedUsername: 17
 Astrobytes: And zero multis/contests I presume
 Zenoscave: any bots?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Why?
 AntiSquid: for real zeno? i doubt it
 Zenoscave: Truly I turn 25 in June
 AntiSquid: well MostComplicatedUsername because you called everyone children
 MostComplicatedUsername: You're acting like children
 AntiSquid: well lead by example then
 Zenoscave: you're acting like childish adults (a.k.a software devs)
 Astrobytes: As adults, that is our right
 Zenoscave: ftfy
 AntiSquid: if you think about it carefully everyone is the child of their parents MostComplicatedUsername
 Zenoscave: ^truth
 Counterbalance: adults are just children with a lot of experience
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid what do you doubt?
 AntiSquid: so just a bunch of elderly kids here
 Astrobytes: Oi, less of the elderly
 AntiSquid: i thought you were older zeno, that's all 
 wolf-555: what are some good games for a noob like myself
 Zenoscave: CSB
 AntiSquid: vindinium
 ZarthaxX: lol no way vindi
 cegprakash: wuut
 AntiSquid: play anything but CSB
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl that's awesome
 Astrobytes: Yava... no
 AntiSquid: ok kutulu then, it has auto pathing 
 Zenoscave: wolf-555 what style of games do you like?
 MSmits: and monsters
 wlesavo: dont play with coc, enything else is fine
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash what's awesome?
 eulerscheZahl: wolf-555 try checkers, it has really simple rules
 wolf-555: I like coc, don't know any other games really @Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you even know them already
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl has a good idea
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/checkers">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/checkers</a>
 Zenoscave: wolf-555 i say do checkers
 wolf-555: did alot of hackerrank and hackerearth before this
 MSmits: or just try the list wolf-555
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 MSmits: there's all of them
 Astrobytes: Or maybe you just prefer the puzzles? 
 eulerscheZahl: 42 multiplayer games :o
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 MSmits: yeah. Too much
 eulerscheZahl: there are also optimization puzzles
 MSmits: but relatively few
 MSmits: and like half of them are yours :P
 eulerscheZahl: when i joined CG, there were 10 multiplayers and 4 optims
 reCurse: In other words you were better off before asking chat
 reCurse: :P
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1: we helped
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: did you do the bot puzzles on hackrrank? wolf-555 
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank has a checkers too
 eulerscheZahl: but CG players are stronger i would say. as linjoehan is at the top on hackerrank
 AntiSquid: kutulu is like the cleaning bot puzzle, except you need to run away while the other players are being cleaned up by monsters, wolf-555
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/checkers/leaderboard">https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/checkers/leaderboard</a>
 wolf-555: I did these paths gold :python, statistics, 30 days. I should finish the problem solving one this week 
 Zenoscave: hackerrank has bot challenges?
 wolf-555: cool thanks guys
 AntiSquid: well ya Zenoscave, but the UI is shit
 eulerscheZahl: it has UI for it?
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank multiplayers: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=ai-introduction">https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=ai-introduction</a>
 AntiSquid: checkers is under expert category :o
 MSmits: makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: depending on how hard you try, it can be justified
 MSmits: it's not an easy game to code a bot for imho
 MSmits: the jumping is pretty complicated
 eulerscheZahl: damn, smits 0.03 points above me on the CG checkers
 MSmits: thats random though
 MSmits: i was below you before
 MSmits: i stopped when i was 8th I think
 AntiSquid: just admit it's skill, stop being so humble
 ZarthaxX: humble smito
 MSmits: this time all the skill i used was high performance
 MSmits: i didnt even try to get a good eval which is more important
 MSmits: didnt feel like it and quit
 MSmits: I think it just counts the pieces now
 Astrobytes: MSmits I thought you were remote-DnD'ing tonight?
 MSmits: DM got a virus
 MSmits: was supposed to be during the day btw
 Astrobytes: Oh crap, no stand-in?
 MSmits: nah
 Astrobytes: Ah
 MSmits: we'll make a new appointment
 Astrobytes: Cool
 ZarthaxX: DM?
 MSmits: dungeon master
 ZarthaxX: thought so
 ZarthaxX: the guy that manages all the story of the game?
 MSmits: yes
 wolf-555: I like csb, just tried it 
 ZarthaxX: the most entwertaining one :P
 MSmits: well he tries to, then we go our own way and screw it all up
 MSmits: it's tradition
 Astrobytes: The Dungeon Master keeps all the gimps in the dungeon and... oh wait, wrong Dungeon
 MSmits: whats that from?
 eulerscheZahl: gimp? the gnu image editing program?
 Astrobytes: Not that gimp no
 eulerscheZahl: manipulation*
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: ah, looked it up
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: definitely not standard vocabulary you learn in school
 MSmits: from what google tells me, i should not click further
 lukasg: hey, does a mine have to be in water or can it be on land?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe from Southpark, Mr. slave
 MSmits: depends lukasg is this a land or sea mine?
 Astrobytes: That type of thing, yes
 eulerscheZahl: that makes the name of the image program weird to me now
 DanTheMan832: has to be on water
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for ruining it
 Astrobytes: It was made that way euler lol
 eulerscheZahl: someone else already ruined git for me
 MSmits: git gud
 MSmits: o right, a git, thats something
 MSmits: not googling again
 Astrobytes: WAsn't that cause Linus is a grumpy git?
 eulerscheZahl: linus thorvalds being friendly when naming his programs
 eulerscheZahl: "use that, git!"
 Astrobytes: Seen Pulp Fiction? It has a gimp.
 AntiSquid: in crystal rush it's on land, in ocean of code it's in water
 AntiSquid: ezpz
 Astrobytes: It will forever be UTG to me
 AntiSquid: the utg letters are silent though
 AntiSquid: in writing and in speech
 Astrobytes: Can I just say Ultra Tedious Game instead? :P
 MSmits: I think you offended AntiSquid and he left
 AntiSquid: yes i left
 Astrobytes: It's impossible to offend the squid
 AntiSquid: all you need to do is submit a typescript bot that wreck mine, just for the sake of wrecking my bot with a typescript bot, i find that very offensive
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, fair point
 Astrobytes: Forgot about your TS sensitivity
 cegprakash: music at full volume when I'm so tired + coding keeps me alive for a while
 YannT: siman has gone into overdrive he doesn't let his submits go anymore than 25% before resubmiting :D
 eulerscheZahl: he already had a good lead on ice and fire before everyone else came and passed him. now it's happening again
 eulerscheZahl: i feel sad for him&#160;:(
 MSmits: he's in legend though
 MSmits: only 60 people
 kovi: he is in top5....
 MSmits: and that...
 AntiSquid: is he upset if he can't get #1&#160;?
 kovi: atm i cant tell the order any more (pb4 and joli is probably most stable)
 Astrobytes: I swear he stays awake for days just resubmitting
 eulerscheZahl: i think the only chatting i did with him was "hi"
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: u epressed me toad
 ZarthaxX: poor sima n
 MSmits: depressed?
 Astrobytes: His english is not so good he said
 ZarthaxX: ye
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 ZarthaxX: with the sima n story
 Astrobytes: And yours too Zar
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: kawano wrote nice post mortems. but always in japanese

 Astrobytes: Fix your typing Zarthington
 Astrobytes: TARDAX

 ZarthaxX: :c
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl that site is like one of jacek's opening books
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: its kawano's blog
 ZarthaxX: beast of a player
 MSmits: yeah it looks cool
 MSmits: wish I could read it
 ZarthaxX: translate lol
 AntiSquid: google translate works alright
 AntiSquid: even for webpages
 eulerscheZahl: yes, does a good job for japanese to english
 MSmits: oh cool
 MSmits: never done that before
 eulerscheZahl: that's how i was able to play mini RAIC

 AntiSquid: looks like he was playing some other contest&#160;?!
 eulerscheZahl: kawano is quite active on twitter too
 eulerscheZahl: contests and cooking
 eulerscheZahl: sushi that is
 MSmits: there is some funny translation though
 kovi: mass resubmit on top....just when im on winstreak....
 Nerchio: from the blog translation
 Nerchio: ReflectionI didn't understand anything
 MSmits: he talks about some kind of pest in his code
 Nerchio: lol

 reCurse:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: A game AI contest that was on April 15, 2019 to May 10, 2019. Puyo like a falling object puzzle game.
 eulerscheZahl: somehow he got inactive after
 eulerscheZahl: still playing on CG but didn't try hard on UTG i think
 Astrobytes: And JP only

 MadKnight: does anyone love Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: if i get the error
 MSmits: but i dont think his anime doll gave consent
 AntiSquid: need an AI that gives consent?
 MadKnight: who created this AI&#160;?
 duckquackduck: what collection do you guys use to store all opponent paths? I used HashSet, but then saw there were many ways to come to same cell. Then tried queue, but that had issues with duplicates.

 Astrobytes: *who are
 Astrobytes: Some other of our JP players
 pb4: I just saw y_kawano too
 Astrobytes: and siman
 Illedan: JP?
 Astrobytes: Japanese
 Illedan: ah, k
 wlesavo: ok, submiting gold boss for the last time, lets see how it does in current meta
 Illedan: did you try earlier?
 wlesavo: a week ago
 wlesavo: it landed around 12-15
 Illedan: Is meta so different now?
 wlesavo: i dunno, may be people evolved
 wlesavo: hows your rewrite btw?
 Illedan: Slooow
 Illedan: Just starting now today
 wlesavo: do you think you will make it in time?
 Illedan: If I can't see progress in the next hour or 2 I'll let it go for the contest and maybe try on the multi
 wlesavo: i see
 wlesavo: i hope you will see some progress and wont sleep tonight :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo: till #1
 Illedan: 10 point lead would be nice before going to bed
 Astrobytes: Delete account if &lt; #1
 ZarthaxX: u mean &gt;
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 wlesavo:&#160;!#1
 Astrobytes: I was pseudo-coding it for Tardax here

 Astrobytes: struct
 struct: I guess i will read that too
 struct: thasnks
 Illedan: 30% of legend in submission :o Impossible to conclude with anything now :D
 wlesavo: so, gold boss seems to be doing ok against higher players, but almost not being able to climb  due to really low wr in 40-60 places, which kinda makes sence, and its placing 40-50
 Zenoscave: This is hard to gauge what is working
 Zenoscave: legend is a mess
 ZarthaxX: yeah&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: new sub Zarthie?
 ZarthaxX: trash submits over and over
 ZarthaxX: im close to quitting this it just makes me sad
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Nerchio: ye i accepted i will be between 20 and 40 probably and thats it :p
 Zenoscave: I'm hoping for at least 60
 ZarthaxX: at least 60?
 Zenoscave: yup
 ZarthaxX: we are all fighting for not ending last
 ZarthaxX: im gonna be the one  anyway
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Zenoscave: Did you wreck bot?
 ZarthaxX: its weirsd
 ZarthaxX: submitted my bot that got legend and ended like 28
 ZarthaxX: but then dropped to 45
 ZarthaxX: so... idk what  to think
 Nerchio: top people submitting beat you over and over like me as well :p
 ZarthaxX: that's a thing right
 ZarthaxX: u just endsomewhere
 ZarthaxX: and they submit permanently and smack u
 Nerchio: y xD
 ZarthaxX: its annoying :P
 ZarthaxX: also losing pts to top players that resubmit just when u submit
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Nerchio: i have a a laugh when i beat top5 submiters though :D
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: how high did you say the legend boss ends up currently&#160;?
 wlesavo: 40-50
 wlesavo: it does ok on the first 10 estimation games, but then gets reckt
 pb4: and the non-bugged-AI-you-had-when-they-picked-the-bugged-legend-boss&#160;?
 pb4: I have no idea how much we've improved since legend opening
 wlesavo: its not really not bugged, just some different parameters values, didnt test that, dont think it would matter that much
 Nerchio: new people in legend? ;p
 wlesavo: turn out i did change something that improoved my bot quite significantly, wonder what that was
 Swagboy: It might be that you changed your bot without significantly improving it but just modified its general behaviour
 Swagboy: And now since every newcomer in legend has specialized his bot against the gold boss, your old bot has troubles
 Zenoscave: I definitely optimized to gold boss at first
 Zenoscave: rip just lost 8 matches in a row on submit
 MSmits: I just improved my bot until it beat gold boss, I did not try to counter it in any specific way
 cegprakash: I'm halfway completed through my simulation
 cegprakash: just 2 functions left
 cegprakash: play and scoring
 wlesavo: Swagboy yeah, that for sure can be the case, but i dont think i changed much significantly
 jojoisyoyis: download swim grader
 bealose: download swim grader
 Swagboy: Ok strange!
 jojoisyoyis: u r strange
 bealose: I agree
 jojoisyoyis: wrecked boi
 MSmits: I want to download it, but no link&#160;:(
 bealose: download swimgrader
 bealose: app store
 MSmits: dont have a smartphone&#160;:(
 MSmits: can i download it on my pc?
 jojoisyoyis: muy mal
 jojoisyoyis: heck no boi
 MSmits: lame
 Zenoscave: jojoisyoyis what is swim grader
 MSmits: it grades your swimming...
 Zenoscave: sounds dumb
 MSmits: how else are you going to know if you swim gud
 Nerchio: download swim grader guys
 Nerchio: lol
 Nerchio: sounds like a scam
 Nerchio: like
 Nerchio: downloading more ram from appstore
 MSmits: thats real

 skotz: just reverted 50 hours worth of changes 
 skotz: feels bad
 cegprakash: why do some games end at 680 turns? is there an upper limit for number of turns
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: and it's frames
 MSmits: not turns
 MSmits: the 680 that is
 cegprakash: frames?
 MSmits: a frame&#160;!= turn
 MSmits: visual thingy
 MSmits: changes in what you see
 MSmits: multiple things happen during a turn
 MSmits: each is a frame
 cegprakash: mm
 MSmits: but once again
 cegprakash: so better to use more combos then
 MSmits: read the statement&#160;:)
 cegprakash: use the frames for myself
 MSmits: sure do that
 Astrobytes: Work it into your GA
 cegprakash: yes
 MSmits: what you can do is place a mine and blow it up the next turn, lots of frames for you
 MSmits: think I improved my bot
 MSmits: but who knows
 Astrobytes: submit or die not knowing
 MSmits: I was working on onitama and then i started getting ideas about logic in ordering of actions
 MSmits: so i coded some stuff in that regard
 cegprakash: no mines or sonar for now
 cegprakash: I think about mines and sonar later
 cegprakash: silver boss doesn't use mines or sonar
 cegprakash: so there should be a way to get to gold without them
 Zenoscave: What orderings did you find MSmits? care to share&#160;;)
 cegprakash: don't
 MSmits: nothing crazy, just torpedo first, move second, or the other way around
 MSmits: it's pretty basic
 MSmits: i never considered it
 YannT: it's lucky that you weren't gonna have time to do the contest today MSmits
 Zenoscave: Ive got that luckily
 YannT: got bitten by the competitivity bug :D
 MSmits: nah, it's more that I don't want to leave good ideas untried. Dont want to have any low-hanging fruit  unpicked
 MSmits: ordering of moves is a simple thing
 YannT: it's actually a cornerstone of what makes my bot work
 YannT: just like locam :p
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but it is simple none the less
 MSmits: not like tracking or mine avoidance
 pb4: what do you call ordering of moves in this case&#160;?
 YannT: like maybe don't silence before surface&#160;;)
 pb4: do you consider a lot of move combinations&#160;?
 pb4: all except some criteria like no silence before surface&#160;?
 MSmits: i dont consider many. I had a very simple bot, but now I consider torpedo and trigger both before and after move
 MSmits: always silence last
 MSmits: sometimes you wanna get out of the way of your own mine triggering
 MSmits: and sometimes you can do more torpedo damage if you move first
 YannT: move+silence and silence+move don't necessarily let you access the same tiles because of islands&#160;;)
 MSmits: my silence always is distance 0 :P
 YannT: ah :D
 MSmits: i need to code something for that as well i suppose
 Swagboy: Haha sly MSmits
 MSmits: i just saw kovi hop over a mine
 MSmits: like that creepy bunny
 pb4: I do that too
 MSmits: i wanna code 2 things before bed
 MSmits: 1) surface to avoid mine
 MSmits: 2) silence mine hopping
 dbdr: did you finish that rewrite Illedan?
 Illedan: Nope
 pb4: MSmits do you consider those two different&#160;? They're the same calculation for me
 dbdr: not enough time?&#160;:(
 MSmits: Then you must have some comprehensive search
 MSmits: I have an if forest for logic
 Illedan: Not enough motivation&#160;:(
 MSmits: I spent very little time on getting good logic for orders. Mostly I did the tracking, beamsearch and such
 MSmits: coded about a week total 
 MSmits: happy about that choice. I know what would have happened if i coded all month. I would be maybe 10 ranks higher and not been able to do anything else. This is not a contest i could have been top 5 at i think
 Swagboy: Why not.
 Swagboy:&#160;?
 MSmits: I don't know. The tracking and such clicks with me. But the game logic a bit less
 MSmits: strategy
 MSmits: like if you played it as a human player, I would not make the right decisions either I think
 Swagboy: I see
 Swagboy: I'm not sure I would either
 MSmits: most of these contests have a strong tactics/strategy aspect to them
 MSmits: it's not just brute force optimization, finding the best search type etc. 
 YannT: actually if you write your bot as a minmax type of thing, there's little actual strategy involved
 Swagboy: I really enjoyed the partial information side tho, first time I played such a game
 MSmits: yeah, thats my thing YannT, I am not that good at that
 MSmits: unless its a simpler game
 MSmits: this game is pretty complex
 Astrobytes: You just haven't reduced the problem space enough
 MSmits: sure, that could be the case
 blasterpoard: definitely very complex... I think I can now say that I gave up several days ago
 YannT: I have a heuristic for what order combination make sense and should be evaluated, but other than that I don't think I've got much "strategy"
 Astrobytes: really blaster? I expected some big submits from you today
 MSmits: blasterpoard remember kutulu? That was simple by comparison. The sim was super complex, but the decisions were few
 blasterpoard: no submits; I had very good algo for pathfinding, for fighting, for when to surface etc.
 blasterpoard: but when I tried to combine them, it just devolved into an ocean of heuristics
 MSmits: thats exactly my problem
 MSmits: bots like that horrify me
 MSmits: so many ifs
 blasterpoard: I had a GA to find path... also had eval of each action involving a silence or torpedo
 blasterpoard: now try to put those two together
 blasterpoard: and also a surface heuristic
 blasterpoard: it just got very messy because of different and incompatible types of "evals"
 YannT: pathfinding is actually the worst part of my bot and the big thing I could've worked more on to rank better
 blasterpoard: MSmits yes, kutulu is a simple game and I think there wasn't that strong competition in that contest 
 YannT: as it is I just have a depth 4 BFS to evaluate moves
 pb4: blasterpoard&#160;: silence isn't considered in your pathfinder&#160;?
 YannT: so it will happily make decision that lead him straight to a minefield if it's more than 4 moves away&#160;:(
 blasterpoard: pb4 only for first couple of turns; but my GA can eval how many cells I "am in" in the future turns
 kovi: even without submit, blaster reached top5&#160;:)
 pb4: I basically launched 144 dijkstra at depth 5 every turn
 blasterpoard: I'll drop to 10 or so
 cegprakash: rofl
 MSmits: blasterpoard the competition seemed pretty strong to me for a 10 day contest, but this is a 30 day contest and it has 3x as many players
 cegprakash: dijkstra to chase enemy?
 cegprakash: why not BFS
 cegprakash: pb4
 YannT: why djikstra for pathing pb4? Oo
 MSmits: dijkstra takes into account cost
 MSmits: bfs does not
 pb4: YannT&#160;: I absolutely don't care where I go
 cegprakash: it's unweighted graph
 pb4: I can about avoiding mines
 cegprakash: why dijkstra
 YannT: ahhh soo you weight mines
 YannT: got it
 Astrobytes: WEight the mines
 MSmits: mine probability damage cegprakash
 MSmits: it is stored per cell
 pb4: So dijkstra will answer the question "what's the cheapest path to go 5 cells deep"
 MSmits: so each cell has a different cost for mine damage
 pb4: I do one of those for each movement combination
 cegprakash: :O
 cegprakash: escape route
 MSmits: i do something similar, only i beamsearch it
 blasterpoard: my pathfinding GA scores each path based on enemy mines it encounters, reaching places where I want to put a mine, length...
 MSmits: weirdly i combine it with a floodfill and a tracking score (to avoid being tracked)
 MSmits: all of that in the same beamsearch
 YannT: that's kind of what I do as well actually, because I have a depth 4 DFS that will backpropagate the mine chance
 MSmits: not sure if thats a good idea
 Illedan: I have that too MSmits
 YannT: main problem is: depth 4 isn't enough
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c80ceee-4c24-4e36-b00a-d2db8e1d3df8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c80ceee-4c24-4e36-b00a-d2db8e1d3df8</a>
 Illedan: In my 4 depth bfs
 MSmits: I go depth 15 for some reason :P
 MSmits: it's beamsearch so..
 YannT: plenty of situations where I'll take a turn that leads straight into a minefield and/or forced surface if it's 5 moves away&#160;:(
 Illedan: Yeah, that makes no sense :P
 MSmits: well yeah, i should drop it to 10 at the most
 blasterpoard: I go depth 15*15, because individuals in my GA are entire maps (imagine there's an arrow on each cell)
 blasterpoard: that's why the bot is so good at tron
 YannT: MSmits: I combine with floodfill too (not self tracking though)
 blasterpoard: until the fight logic breaks it with a bad move
 YannT: depth 4 BFS with backprop of a mini eval from mine chance and floodfill
 YannT: and that's basically the move score parameter for the actual eval
 MSmits: btw pb4 dont share too much, some of these guys wont go to bed till end of contest&#160;:)
 Swagboy: Hehe
 Illedan: True
 Zenoscave: It's only 4PM here ;0
 Illedan: :scream:
 pb4: kovi lucky push or did you actually make a bot that's not weak against me anymore&#160;?
 kovi: i have no idea
 pb4: I really liked your pushs these last 3 weeks :D
 kovi: have been here few hours ago
 dbdr: Illedan back in top 10 :thumbsup:
 Illedan: Shhhh, don't break my luck
 dbdr: :no_mouth:
 kovi: you dont need luck here, just after 10 hours
 Illedan: That message gave me a huge lose streak&#160;:(
 Illedan: And the planets are not aligned anymore
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: Oops
 dbdr: 6 out of top 8 in submit
 Illedan: Crazy times
 dbdr: not counting those further down on their way back
 YannT: it's curfew time no one submit until tomorrow morning now
 dbdr: only in select countries
 Astrobytes: Internet curfew?
 YannT: opkay fine just don't kick my out of top20 then, I want that tshirt :p
 dbdr: no worries
 YannT: :thumbsup:
 1998marcom: Q: Is there any way to ask for a complete output of the compiler errors? It gets truncated too early and I can't understand the issue. And I cannot reproduce the error on my PC, because there is no error according to my g++, and I can even run my program locally on the git cloned server.
 wlesavo: me too
 Zenoscave: How important is sonar?
 MSmits: depends on how well you use it i guess. Not sure otherwise
 dbdr: you can do without it
 Zenoscave: ok
 Zenoscave: I'm losing matches a lot in stupid ways and i cant figujre out why
 Zenoscave: I think it's mine detection
 MSmits: definitely a big deal
 MSmits: i dont think I got it right either
 MSmits: it works-ish
 Zenoscave: Same
 dbdr: same
 kovi: hmm, maybe its not just luck
 dbdr: as YannT said, there is constantly one person 1-2 points above the rest
 pb4: big change&#160;?
 dbdr: it's just that that person changes every 20 minutes
 kovi: no, im just parameter finetuning
 kovi: but i know what blaster realized
 kovi: some parameters may have more influence, than adding a full algo
 kovi: and a loosestreak...val is strong
 blasterpoard: meh... I'm not sure anything has any influence
 blasterpoard: this exact bot ended at #35 on its first submit
 blasterpoard: and it's also been as high as #5
 kovi: well, most game is decided on bad luck on some all-out fire
 blasterpoard: the crazy variance is mostly why I stopped trying (but it mostly means that my bot breaks a lot)
 kovi: but your bot has battle....
 kovi: so it must be suffering from the luck of winning the minefield
 kovi: (bigger part of the field)
 blasterpoard: my bot doesn't have the battle thing I made, because although it won battles, it wanted to battle way too often
 kovi: i c
 blasterpoard: that's what I spoke about; I have good algos for most of the game, but putting it all together was beyond my abilities
 kovi: pity. it looked promising
 kovi: i started to implemented battle for 1vs1 chance...but realized that it would be too narrow
 Illedan: Just need 2k lines of narrow handling to beat this game :P ANd then you need the generic stuff on top of it
 blasterpoard: kovi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452988564">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452988564</a> this is what the bot does with that battle sim turned on
 blasterpoard: it works out quite often, but the bot just doesn't climb
 MSmits: it's hard to say what would have happened without the battle sim, it may work, but if you would have won without it and it sometimes hurts...
 blasterpoard: usually it randomly uses torpedo + silence because it "wins the fight" and loses out on 3 mines
 blasterpoard: and trying to make some rules for when to fight just didn't work
 MSmits: yeah sounds hard
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e625b63-e486-42cf-8bc6-ed4171f755f3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e625b63-e486-42cf-8bc6-ed4171f755f3</a>
 cegprakash: is this the input format in first 2 turns
 cegprakash: feels like 1 line is missing in between to me
 cegprakash: positions should come before NAs right
 cegprakash: okay my bad
 cegprakash: cegbug
 cegprakash: used cerr and stringstream instead of using only stringstream
 cegprakash: I usually append my cerrs to stringstream
 cegprakash: and finally cerrr the stringstream
 MostComplicatedUsername: I asked god for a bike, but I know god doesn't work that way. So I stole a bike and asked for forgiveness.
 Uljahn: some atoms moved, no big deal, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah, i need to do
 MostComplicatedUsername: Why does breach gotta be so hard?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Automaton2000 you have any answers?
 Automaton2000: did you mean you dont need to use in real life
 cegprakash: submitting my first sim bot
 cegprakash: pray for my bot
 CyrusTheCurator: -prays-
 MostComplicatedUsername: pra- AHHHHH
 <b>**MostComplicatedUsername gets incinerated by god</b></p><p><img src="/a/30164580489497" /> <b>**MostComplicatedUsername regrets stealing the bike</b></p><p><img src="/a/10550602859943" /> cegprakash: I don't know how to give direction priority in my eval
 cegprakash: in case of ties
 lxnn: Is 'SILENCE N 0' considered a valid move when silence isn't fully charged?
 cegprakash: yes lukasg
 cegprakash: yes lxnn
 lxnn: Oh really
 MostComplicatedUsername: Is it possible to silence and move on the same turn?
 cegprakash: my simu acts like a drunkard
 cegprakash: especially move commands
 icecream17: yes 
 lxnn: I was wondering why my tracker was doing such a bad job. The bot was spamming silence 0 and I believed it.
 lxnn: without tracking the charge levels to check that the command was valid
 VincentBab: hum i dont think you receive the SILENCE order when the opponent SILENCE is not valid
 lxnn: ok thanks, I'll try printing the output and see
 icecream17: Imagine this command: "MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO 7 7 | SONAR 5 | SURFACE | TRIGGER 6 4 | MINE S | MSG *wins*"
 icecream17: Oh no I forgot the "SILENCE N 4"
 VincentBab: whats the point of SURFACE after MOVE &amp; TORPEDO&#160;? ^^
 icecream17: Avoid mines? Run away to silence? Bug?
 MostComplicatedUsername: No he's trying to do every possible action
 icecream17: My record is 5. (But I almost never use sonar... and surface...)
 VincentBab: SURFACE | MOVE N TORPEDO | SILENCE N 4 | TORPEDO 7 7 | TRIGGER 7 8 | MSG *u didnt see that one comming huh&#160;?!*
 VincentBab: xD
 MSmits: I prefer my MSG "FATALITY"
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/453023498">https://www.codingame.com/replay/453023498</a>
 MSmits: it's rare, but it happens. a win vs pb4 on the lb&#160;:)
 VincentBab: haha you locked him up in the corner with your mines ^^
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 wlesavo: MSmits thats my MSG :slight_smile: gold boss have it as well 
 MSmits: I know
 MSmits: I like it
 wlesavo: dam, battle for #1 in python is really close
 MSmits: I have absolutely no idea which bot version i wrote is best =/
 Swagboy: So is for c++ wlesavo&#160;!
 icecream17: How long can your messages be?
 MadKnight: in OoC&#160;?
 MadKnight: how long do u need them&#160;?
 icecream17: Not on screen, but as shown in the stdout stream. (Onscreen is enough room, but i'm planning to do something....)
 MostComplicatedUsername: oh
 MadKnight: std is pretty long
 MadKnight: like 1000
 MadKnight: why don't u use stderr&#160;?
 cegprakash: Tried to fire out of range
 cegprakash: I can't fire when there is an island i between
 cegprakash: damn

 cegprakash: I love my simu though
 cegprakash: oh I'm using manhattan on my distances everywhere
 cegprakash: instead of BFS distance
 icecream17: Awwww.... this message was too long and didn't work:

 MSmits: I do that too
 VincentBab: whats the point lol&#160;?
 dbdr: did not help euler
 skotz: alternative is surface, so might as well dispose of mines
 MSmits: you might kill the other guy
 dbdr: stay alive longer
 MSmits: with some luck
 dbdr: also
 dbdr: maybe the other one will have to surface and die
 VincentBab: ohhhh im stupid, i didn't see he had to surface xD
 dbdr: now THAT's a good start&#160;:)
 VincentBab: maybe i should implement that feature xD
 dbdr: VincentBab it's minor but does not hurt
 VincentBab: yeah but thats hard to test
 dbdr: it's very easy actually
 dbdr: if you cannot move and you have one life and you have a mine, trigger it
 MSmits: uh, try to trigger the mine you're sitting on last :P
 dbdr: yeah, I skipped that part knowingly :D
 dbdr: going out with a bang
 MSmits: yeah, i just use the same logic for mines i normally do except omit the rule for them having the cause the opponent damage
 MSmits: this has got to be one of the worst contests for gauging your bot strength
 MSmits: I still have no idea if this is my best version or not
 MSmits: I'm somewhere between 25 and 50
 dbdr: calling 42&#160;;)
 icecream17: Uh-oh. The timer is flashing
 MSmits: heh, hoping for better 
 MSmits: but sure
 icecream17: I'm 44th right now in silver!
 dbdr: ranking 42 gives a ecret achievement
 dbdr: *secret
 MSmits: cool
 cegprakash: how do I debug this tracker that bugs at 55th turn
 dbdr: flashing since when?
 dbdr: 7H 5 minutes? maybe a round number of seconds&#160;:)
 MSmits: allright, I am going to bed. Tomorrow is my last day teaching before vacation
 dbdr: good night!
 MSmits: well its not really a day, mor elike an hour :P
 MSmits: gn&#160;:)
 icecream17: Ugh! I keep trying to shoot 4 square down, but there's an island in the way....
 tarriel: I hate it when my code base reaches the size limit, it sucks all the fun out of this game
 TrentT: What is the size limit?
 tarriel: once your code reaches a certain size coding game rejects it
 tarriel: At this point in the competition I have a lot of cruft that i don't want to clean up, lots of comments ro remind me of things and aparently I have hit the code limit
 skotz: 100kb
 skotz: meaningful variable names and comments are overrated anyway&#160;:)
 tarriel: I 'm not sure what the number is, I just know it won't run when I upload it, so I have to delete comments, remove spaces , rename variables, it sucks the fun out of the game...
 TrentT: It makes it more realistic, can't just keep sizing up your EC2 instances..
 TrentT: Amazon will be happy with you but your wallet won't
 tarriel: hmm but it is a tiny amount in this day and age
 tarriel: I end up with a different version in my editor and the game
 TrentT: How many lines do you have?
 tarriel: 2422 
 tarriel: not including my tests&#160;:)

 cegprakash: why is my sim not working so good on arena
 cegprakash: works like a charm on IDE
 tarriel: whatch some games from your submission, particularly the ones you lose, there will be a bug there somewhere...
 reCurse: tarriel the limit is 100k characters fyi
 icecream17: Submitting. Good night. Still silver. I hope.
 icecream17: Wow. Almost no one submitting. 9:28 PM
 reCurse: Majority of contestants are in europe
 reCurse: It's 4am there :p
 muslim: why there are no c++ programmers here xd
 KrembledKatsuo: i know c++ .. 
 eulerscheZahl: happy 5am
 dbdr: \o eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: you are early too
 eulerscheZahl: i had a full month, time for some panic changes
 Swagboy: With you on those
 Swagboy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453090567">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453090567</a> funny map
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl I'm late :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh, wow
 dbdr: jolindien has been in submit the whole night too I think&#160;:)
 jolindien: yeah
 jolindien: sorry for spam push
 Swagboy: No worries
 jolindien: last tunings&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i only do this when i'm desperate and home for the golden param
 eulerscheZahl: and i missed the neumann promotion
 reCurse: So I looked up code vs a bit more, was curious
 reCurse: Seems defunct now&#160;:/ Used to be japan's version of CG apparently
 reCurse: Similar games
 eulerscheZahl: too bad we only find out about it now that it's too late&#160;:(
 reCurse: I'm a bit amazed at the production value though
 reCurse: Code vs reborn has tons of arts and even music tracks
 reCurse: And live audience finals
 reCurse: It's a bit over the top
 eulerscheZahl: expensive prizes too?
 reCurse: No clue
 reCurse: I think it was mainly used as a recruitment platform
 reCurse: Judging from their old signup page
 reCurse: I've been able to dig up the japanese statement of all their games should we ever need more inspiration
 eulerscheZahl: how many were there?
 reCurse: 6 in total
 eulerscheZahl: how often? once a year?
 reCurse: Roughly, except there was a few years hiatus between 5.0 and reborn
 reCurse: Probably why the codename
 reCurse: The next one would have been due for right now too
 reCurse: But everything is gone
 reCurse: Twitter is deleted
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 reCurse: Anyway was fun detective work

 cegprakash: and it performs too bad
 reCurse: Rerun is going to be tight
 eulerscheZahl: even for LOCAM it was easier to predict the winner
 reCurse: Nah
 reCurse: No way
 eulerscheZahl: i still bet on a final blasterpoard submit
 struct: I bet on pb
 reCurse: I'll go with pb3 for the meme :D
 Swagboy: Benchmarked against kovi pb4 jolindien
 eulerscheZahl: the US starwars toaster
 Swagboy: 50.0 55.0 50.0
 Swagboy: That's tight
 kovi: morning
 eulerscheZahl: hi

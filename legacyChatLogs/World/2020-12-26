 jacek: merry Caturday
 VizGhar: How come, there are still more moderators online then common users_
 mzbear: that user list isn't reliable
 jacek: smits finally winning some games vs remi
 eulerscheZahl: VizGhar because you only see 2 types of users in the list: moderators and active chatterswhile moderators see all the active users
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/wa7yk2">https://prnt.sc/wa7yk2</a>see the scrollbar on the right
 eulerscheZahl: external clients also show the full list
 jrke: damn smits bot&#160;!!!
 jacek: oO
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: just fixing some bugs
 MSmits: hope that will get me &gt; 50% vs remi
 MSmits: otherwise picking the right randomseed will
 jrke: what you did btw
 MSmits: he's very deterministic
 MSmits: the right randomseed will be like an opening book in 1  number :P
 jrke: i think some minmaxing at few steps before endgame to get good gamestate
 MSmits: not exactly, but yes, a few steps before the endgame i pick the lines that give me control over the endgame
 MSmits: not by minimax though
 jrke: ah ok
 MSmits: I use Nim theory
 MSmits: as I am sure Remi is, in some way
 MSmits: my first 50 plies are still random
 jrke: i am writing endgame solver its breaking some where (timeouts) but don't know why
 MSmits: which, in  combination with the winrate, shows you that noone has any idea how to play the early game
 jrke: yes i see
 MSmits: hm
 MSmits: well timeouts can be caused by anything
 MSmits: it should be similar to minimax though, except it's not depth limited
 SupSon: strings and coins
 MSmits: thats a dual representation of D&amp;B
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a56a667-d7b0-4cce-9bc1-91be8442827f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a56a667-d7b0-4cce-9bc1-91be8442827f</a>
 MSmits: my bot printed as strings and coins
 MSmits: board
 MSmits: a star is a coin (or a box), lines are strings instead of sides
 MSmits: instead of setting lines, you cut strings
 MSmits: can be helpful sometimes to gain some insight
 MSmits: but otherwise it's just a way to print the board
 MSmits: end game solver is fun, but jrke, if you want to win significantly more, endgame solver is not enough. It only helped me a tiny bit compared to other players
 MSmits: the nimstring stuff is more important
 jrke: so didn't you used your endgame solver in this bot?
 MSmits: yeah its in there
 MSmits: it's 1500 lines out of 3k total :P
 MSmits: the nimstring search is like 500 lines
 MSmits: the rest of the bot is other stuff
 jrke: i am choosing smallest chain and playing it and reverting last 3 moves and then i am minimaxing them and for its eval i again choose smallest chain and it continues 
 jrke: is it correct for solving endgame^ and getting maximum values gained by me and opp if no one do mistake
 MSmits: there's also loops
 MSmits: often it's better to open loops first
 MSmits: because to control them, you leave 4 boxes
 MSmits: so if the opponent wants to keep control he has to give you 4
 jrke: i am minimaxing last 3 reverted moves so it should decide to keep control or not
 MSmits: there is no one size fits all heuristic here. It depends on the exact combination of chains and loops
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well if you minmax it all, then it will be ok
 MSmits: but this way might be extremely expensive
 MSmits: for some endgames
 MSmits: there could be 10-15 such choices to make
 MSmits: you need lots of pruning
 MSmits: meaning heuristics to choose what options to even consider
 MSmits: also, you say "smallest", but what do you do when several have the same size
 MSmits: the way they are connected by joint, might have an impact on how the game continues
 MSmits: merging some chains etc.
 MSmits: well... good news. my CG benchs says 80% vs remi
 MSmits: bad news, i see a horrible bug sometimes and i dont know what it is =/
 jrke: congrats 1st then
 MSmits: might not get it on first submit, he has been pushed a lot
 jrke: try 2-3 times then
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: allright, have to feed my daughter :p
 MSmits: brb
 jrke: bye
 zhoubou: What kind of thing are you guys doing? 3k lines??
 zhoubou: I'm new to this :P
 jrke: some search + some heuristic stuff
 zhoubou: Is it tied to CodinGame or some outside project?
 jrke: dots and boxes bot
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes</a>
 MSmits: 3k lines is insane, most of my bots are barely over 1k
 jrke: my average lines atm are 500 from lat 3 months it became 800
 jrke: looks 1 submit is enough MS
 MSmits: maybe
 jacek: just keep hammering
 MSmits: will do&#160;:)
 MSmits: the games i lose vs remi is when in the 5-10 plies before the endgame i have 0 options to change the outcome of the nim value calculation, meaning he has control
 MSmits: often he leaves me an option though
 MSmits: he has some probabilistic approach, maybe mcts, to get control
 jrke: another 50 pointer
 jacek: like another over 50 years old?
 jrke: 50 points 
 MSmits: only in spirit jacek&#160;:)
 k4ng0u: lose first game to keep some suspens then win the next 8 haha
 jrke: new first ranker
 MSmits: looks like made it, only 1 lost game lol
 jrke: yes
 jrke: gtg bye
 MSmits: bye
 jrke: i will be fixing my bot and i will be there
 jacek: time to pm remi
 jrke: if i got succeded in my bot
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: you mean you want me to pm, or are you?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: you have a short line to the great Remi?
 MSmits: or maybe he will get an automail if you pm him on the forum
 jrke: i have like (my lifespan - 13) years to complete my bot lol 
 MSmits: you do
 MSmits: but as i said
 jacek: well there is also his twitter
 MSmits: you need to focus on the math here
 MSmits: this is one of the few games that is about the math
 jacek: and he made d&amp;b for phones <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1341488601792712706">https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1341488601792712706</a>
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: no wonder he is that good
 jacek: and jrke is on the screenshot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1311426326868430849/photo/1">https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1311426326868430849/photo/1</a>
 MSmits: he is really invested in this game
 jacek: "Hmm, just gives me a black screen on my iPhone. And an ad. Disappointing"
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: maybe a troll
 jrke: now we need new league in D&amp;B too much in wood 1 atm
 MSmits: did you ever check the csb leagues?
 jrke: :smiley:
 jacek: make new league and smits bot as boss
 jrke: a league of 1 person lol
 SupSon: need a batman signal for remi
 MSmits: I still have 3 more ideas to improve bot though
 MSmits: bit tired of looking at this 3k monster atm, but if he comes back, so will i
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: so what now? b? Y? something else?
 MSmits: well i was gonna rewrite uttt again until someone pushed me to try D&amp;B
 MSmits: forgot who it was, maybe jrke
 MSmits: but not really feeling like uttt
 MSmits: i really want to do bt, but i am a bit out of ideas
 MSmits: i can totally see why darkhorse got stuck on his own game there
 jacek: oh im out of top10 in uttt :c
 MSmits: he thinks like me
 MSmits: maybe bit less obsessed
 jacek: i am obsessed with bt
 MSmits: yeah, well i would be too if i knew how to play it well
 MSmits: it's a nice game
 jacek: even before NN, id optimize piece-square tables and other params
 MSmits: oh so you're saying i just gave up too soon
 jacek: if youre not 1st, its always too soon
 MSmits: good point
 MSmits: not sure yet though, i put off a long list of work i am supposed to do during this christmas break
 MSmits: so maybe i'll just let my two meta mcts work while i do actual work 
 jacek: yeah, heating the house
 MSmits: exactly
 SupSon: get bopped jacek
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: thats just how he says merry christmas
 SupSon: bopped you outta top 10
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: you bopped re curse above me also
 MSmits: i dont mind, he needs the boost of confidence
 MSmits: :P
 YurkovAS: has public info about progress in top10 uttt? some new heuristics or mcts improvements...
 3569066: Oo
 MSmits: not much has changed
 MSmits: it's just shifts due to  people submitting
 MSmits: and supson improved his bot i think
 YurkovAS: ok, thanks
 YurkovAS: +-3 month ago amurushkin find great mcts improvement (+5-15%), he told me by secret. And my bot started win Nagrarok.
 MSmits: oh ok, cool
 MSmits: yeah there are a lot of little things like that
 MSmits: but sometimes they dont combine well
 MSmits: so A works, but not if you also do B
 MSmits: B works, but not if you also do C, etc.
 SJ_01: can someone give a source for learning Trilateration please? 
 MSmits: no idea what that is
 MSmits: bilateral is 2 people talking
 MSmits: maybe if we find another person, we can have a trilateral
 darkhorse64: I guess it's for shadows of the night 2. You have to explore x direction then y direction. Also look at the graphics, they explain which part of the building you can drop.
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: well gonna go to celebrate christmas for most of the day
 MSmits: dont steal my new nr 1 while i am out
 ChampionCoder: Is there the landing coordinates of the Mars Lander-Episode 2 given?
 eulerscheZahl: you are 2 days late
 ChampionCoder: Not sure if it is
 darkhorse64: There is a Connect4 in the WIP, I am writing a bot for it. You can do bitboarding, books, mcts minimax
 MSmits: we have 2nd christmas day for some reason
 MSmits: i guess thats not international
 eulerscheZahl: have have a public holiday today as well
 eulerscheZahl: we have*
 MSmits: ah ok
 zhoubou: Same
 ChampionCoder: Is there the landing coordinates of the Mars Lander-Episode 2 given?
 ChampionCoder: Not able to find it if it is
 MSmits: you need to land on a flat area
 MSmits: any
 eulerscheZahl: 2 consecutive points with same y
 ChampionCoder: Oh so no coordinates?
 MSmits: nope
 ChampionCoder: Thanks will try that
 MSmits: allright thats it, ttyl guys
 eulerscheZahl: bye
 johnytep24: hi
 VizGhar: yeey made almost 400k score on 2048. Reaching that 600 commands limit with BFS... Now I need to switch to beam and solve the limit problem&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Congrats!
 VizGhar: tnx
 zhoubou: I went for the simplest solution just to solve it without going Up all the time. I'll need to solve a lot of easier puzzles to practice first...
 VizGhar: yeah... Probably the best way
 Miles-M: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e57dfe4a-e5ce-4256-8698-2cdb8f09eb03">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e57dfe4a-e5ce-4256-8698-2cdb8f09eb03</a>
 alenic: Hi guys, in optimization puzzle, is it possible to hard code a series of moves computed offline, without writing any algorithm&#160;? (only when the test coincides with validation) Or is it frobidden&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: for some optim puzzles that hardcoding is pretty common at the top ranks
 eulerscheZahl: 2048 is probably the only one where you can't fully do it (as there are so many actions and you have a code size limit on codingame)
 zhoubou: Miles-M I solved 1D spreadsheet using 2 simple recursive functions.
 alenic: thank you eulerscheZahl, you hit my problem&#160;:), I'm thinking about an hybrid solution where the first moves are hard coded and the rest is a tree search. By the way, nice puzzle&#160;;)
 VizGhar: if you have already slved it, ypu can see others solutions
 alenic: I focused too much on a compression algorithm than a good tree search :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: thanks alenicand also thanks for not stopping after the 100% and completing the puzzle quest
 eulerscheZahl: zip your path and encode it (base64 for starters, other encodings with unicode are more efficient)
 alenic: I used a bit packing (is more efficient than zlib) with a base85 encoding, I reached a 3.7x compression
 VizGhar: Yeah main criticis was on "how easy this 2048 is" :P
 eulerscheZahl: and if you do some cheap heuristic for your next action and only compress those moves where your heuristic is different?
 alenic: nice idea&#160;! I will think about it...
 eulerscheZahl: evil me used 2048 to farm language achievements
 alenic: ehehe, I'm only at 11 million score, 62 million is very insane...
 VizGhar: :D thanks for recommendation eulerscheZahl finally will reach silver on ocaml :D
 eulerscheZahl: A*Craft is also great for language achievements
 k4ng0u: on 2048 I feel like it's fine to get a good score with a beam search but to reach the top it's actually pretty hard. I don't know how top players do, but they either need a real good eval function, or game state hash or they use a totally different algorithm
 k4ng0u: overall my feeling is that beam search usually provides an better than average solution but rarely the best :p (but maybe I am missing some heuristics or good eval)
 wlesavo: k4ng0u all top players beam search with snake eval, maybe apart from dbdr 
 alenic: maybe top palyer use some neural network trained offline used for example to evaluate a grid&#160;? (like Q network)
 VizGhar: I wonder how to evaluate snake properly&#160;:) I'm only counting how long is the snake and I'm pretty far
 VizGhar: Also I feel like I'm making too much operations just to evaluate the board. Everything else looks fine
 k4ng0u: wlesavo what is snake eval?
 VizGhar: you are trying to keep tiles in descending order in "snake-like" shape
 VizGhar: so better is to have 2048-1024-16-4 in first row then 2048-512-1024-16
 wlesavo: k4ng0u basically sum of tiles witth discount in snake order, you can use that as hash also, it is not the best way but works for me
 k4ng0u: thx VizGhar and wlesavo for the tip, I will try it when I have the time, it'll certainly better than the raw score eval I currently use
 k4ng0u: by the way wlesavo, I see you are participating in raic. how would you grade the competitiveness compared to codingame contests?
 wlesavo: k4ng0u top200-300 close to cg silver, but finals aka top60 close to cg legend, although it is quite harder to start, since you have to deal with the api they provide. overall it is not much harder but very much different
 wlesavo: first raic for me, but cg prepared me well enough
 k4ng0u: I read the rules quickly, how do you handle the max time per game? do you allocate time to first time and then divide the rest by the max nb turns afterwards?
 eulerscheZahl: you have 40s for the total game (1k ticks) and max 1s per turn
 eulerscheZahl: so there is that "time bank" that we are missing on CG
 Astrobytes: very different but great fun
 eulerscheZahl: and all submits are public, you can always play vs older versions of opponents. and even test matches are public, which makes hiding your bot less unfair
 eulerscheZahl: of course you can still hide. at the cost of not testing vs others in the arena
 eulerscheZahl: i would agree that finals are similar to CG legend
 eulerscheZahl: the tshirt on the other hand is really easy to get if you have 1 or 2 afternoons to invest
 Astrobytes: ^
 wlesavo: k4ng0u also this one is more heuristic, so with faster languages you basically dont care much about time. i think some tops do, but you can get quite far even without custom pathfinding
 k4ng0u: ok I see, very interesting
 eulerscheZahl: but you just missed the time for RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: maybe there will be a contest on aicups.ruotherwise you have to wait until next year
 eulerscheZahl: aicups.ru is all Russian (rules, website, ..)but you are still allowed to play and win prizes
 k4ng0u: yep I know&#160;:( I discovered it by chance on the chat the other day. I am just looking at the ranking, and it seems like there are a lot of current/previous codingamers participating to it and not doing too bad!
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, the CG raid was efficient this year&#160;;)
 jrke: i discovered CG this year and started hackerrank a month ago nothing else
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank is pretty much dead
 eulerscheZahl: they had contests with real prizes
 eulerscheZahl: but now these very rare contests for limited groups only
 eulerscheZahl: like for women in the US
 jrke: lol
 zhoubou: What is raic?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>
 zhoubou: Oh, thanks!
 leojean890: RAIC games are complex compared to CG. amurushkin recently told that all previous RAIC contests will be soon released as multiplayer games.
 eulerscheZahl: cool, I didn't know that
 Astrobytes: that will be awesome
 leojean890: he told that on #RAIC2020
 eulerscheZahl: too bad that many previous bots are public
 Astrobytes: yeah I thought I saw him mention it
 leojean890: it will be interesting
 Astrobytes: Didn't somebody say something about moving to new servers too?
 eulerscheZahl: i read about the current one remaining active
 eulerscheZahl: missed the info about previous ones
 leojean890: maybe, and would be good news, because there are too few games in my opinion^^
 eulerscheZahl: next: RAIC SDK
 eulerscheZahl: create whatever game you couldn't do on CG because of server limitations
 leojean890: previous contests seem to be very hard.. 3D collisions&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: in 2018 they gave a lot of code at least
 leojean890: to make some football with cars :p
 eulerscheZahl: i played that
 leojean890: are you saying that many codes are public&#160;?
 leojean890: oh ok, I think that it was hard, no&#160;?:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, most of top10 shared their bots on github
 leojean890: arf ok
 leojean890: too bad :s
 eulerscheZahl: there's even a repo collecting those links
 leojean890: so not only PMs but full code :s
 leojean890: (on CG it happens as well..)
 leojean890: but not often
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/RussianAICup">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/RussianAICup</a>even I shared some code
 eulerscheZahl: because RAIC is over when it's over
 leojean890: ok I see^^
 eulerscheZahl: no one could expect a revival
 leojean890: because it was not planned for a long time that multis would be released..
 Astrobytes: it will be nice to have something to play outside of CG. Not that we are lacking games here :D
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC is just different
 Astrobytes: It was a refreshing change.
 eulerscheZahl: finally no guesswork about missing input
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: The API is a little odd, but you get used to it soon enough
 leojean890: different and more complex so different challenges:)
 leojean890: the API is not very intuitive, yeah :s
 eulerscheZahl: CG is like: there's a unit. I won't tell you the current HP
 Astrobytes: hahaha, so true
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC is like: and the unit has green pants. not sure if you have to know but i tell you anyways
 Astrobytes: Totally on point :D
 leojean890: there are too much info I think indeed:p
 leojean890: like in CG "BOTG"
 Astrobytes: Nah it's not *that* bad :P
 eulerscheZahl: BOTG lacked rage info
 eulerscheZahl: or however it was called
 leojean890: rage&#160;?
 Astrobytes: rage was MM
 leojean890: ah MM yeah:)
 eulerscheZahl: when minions attack your heroes and not your minions
 leojean890: I didn't understand the rage concept:p
 leojean890: in MM
 leojean890: oh ok
 leojean890: I did BOTG multi in 2 hours so I don't know very well this topic^^ but it was.. complex!
 eulerscheZahl: I meant aggro
 eulerscheZahl: not given in input
 eulerscheZahl: squid is offline, so i can say it: i hated BOTG :P
 Astrobytes: I gave up on botg after all those wood leagues. It certainly aggravated me
 Astrobytes: How that was a contest is beyond me in all honety
 Astrobytes: *honesty
 eulerscheZahl: they even removed 2 more heroes
 Astrobytes: Still, each to their own I suppose :shrug:
 eulerscheZahl: but it's a lesson learned, there won't be such a contest in the future or took place after
 Astrobytes: The concept is nice, if not the game itself.
 eulerscheZahl: remove some aspects and it fits better to CG
 eulerscheZahl: hero selection, items, potions, gold, minions, tower, aggro, groot, bushes
 eulerscheZahl: just too much for CG expectations
 eulerscheZahl: and I forgot to mention hero skills
 leojean890: I didn't struggle with woods, use one liner I think&#160;? but bronze was harder and didn't make it fast, maybe I will go on one day
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it was easy to pass but I was totally bored by the time I got to bronze
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm a little too negative about the game as it was unfinished when the contest started
 eulerscheZahl: so that's my first impression and then it's hard to change my mind
 Astrobytes: Maybe someone will revisit the concept some day
 struct: Well I dont really have an opinion about it, I havent really played it
 eulerscheZahl: hell no
 eulerscheZahl: and also no to locam 2.0
 Astrobytes: :D

 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 jacek: eeyup
 eulerscheZahl: "Watch me fail at easy puzzles"

 eulerscheZahl: and he has those annoying follower animations
 Astrobytes: what annoying follower animations?
 eulerscheZahl: animation shown on the whole screen
 eulerscheZahl: with the name of the follower
 Astrobytes: Oh. II haven't followed and didn't see
 eulerscheZahl: someone else just followed when i opened the stream
 Astrobytes: we should really be in there trolling him :P
 eulerscheZahl: i think he did ?disableChat

 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a game really nice to see the code and come back after a contest
 eulerscheZahl: false alert, no one pinged me
 jacek: AutomatonNN is that so
 AutomatonNN: and I don't know what that is
 zhoubou: There is the answer
 JavaSuck: yo does some1 got covid right now&#160;?
 if__name__.__fox__: I bet many do
 Toby75: Hi, has someone time and effort to test something together with me? I wrote a code, that I tried out anywhere and it should work, but the test cases still show errors...
 Toby75: It's the Temperatures challenge written in JS
 jacek: test cases or validators?\
 lolo460: me confuse
 Toby75: sorry Validators
 Toby75: [SPOILER <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/8N0a7X1M">https://pastebin.com/8N0a7X1M</a> ] paste this into the Temperatures example, and view the validators. They say that I must print the positive one, if there is a positive and a negative number equally to zero. Now test it with node or on a web page with a positive and negative number, and you will see, that only positive numbers are getting printed. 
 Toby75: So what the Validators say makes no sense
 Toby75: And before I did it another way, there the test cases showed me 100%, but not the validators
 BrunoFelthes: man, you misunderstood the problem
 Toby75: what is the problem?
 BrunoFelthes: only it the negative and the positive are equal, you must get the positive
 BrunoFelthes: *if
 Toby75: That's what I did
 Toby75: When the array is [10, -3, 7, 3] I would need to print 3
 Toby75: That's what my code does
 jacek: what if its  [10, -3, 7, -3] 
 jacek: will it print -3?
 BrunoFelthes: you even dont do any comparation without the Math.abs..
 Toby75: Then it prints out -3
 Toby75: yes
 jacek: hmm
 Toby75: I would not have called this out if I was not sure that there is a big problem
 Toby75: I'm quite sure that my code should work, sadly I can't see which test cases have failed
 Toby75: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/k1xRMrcp">https://pastebin.com/k1xRMrcp</a>
 jacek: it failed 4th test case
 Toby75: i know
 Toby75: but why??
 Toby75: I tried out the array [10, 5, -5, 7, 11] AND [10, -5, 7, 5, 11] in node, and it always printed 5
 Toby75: so it also does not matter which one is first, the negative one or the positive one
 jacek: [42 5 12 21 -5 24] it fails, dunno why yet
 Toby75: I just checked that one in node
 Toby75: exactly that one
 Toby75: it prints 5
 Toby75: not -5
 Toby75: that's why I am so confused
 Toby75: just lmk if you find out what happened lmao
 jacek: mhm
 Toby75: got it
 Toby75: was really an issue with codingame
 Toby75: their node version does not support array.includes
 Toby75: but it did not show me an error
 jacek: huh
 Toby75: the weird thing it, that every other node runner supported array.includes
 Toby75: I tried it on several websites and on my own node on my pc
 Toby75: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/kuaZgPFK">https://pastebin.com/kuaZgPFK</a> that one used to work, instead of the .includes
 zhoubou: My browser supports `includes`, but it still returns -5
 Toby75: That is so weird
 Toby75: all pages like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playcode.io/">https://playcode.io/</a> showed 5 not -5
 zhoubou: Ohh I see the error
 zhoubou: Inputs is an array of strings
 zhoubou: Not ints
 Toby75: bruh
 zhoubou: Of course it doesn't find -5 in [..., '-5', ...]
 Toby75: thought that would not make a difference
 Toby75: +"" would have fixed all
 zhoubou:&#160;:)
 Toby75: So just newer versions of node dont't care about types in the .includes
 Toby75: that's why I could not find that out on any other pages
 Toby75: yeah, nvm at least I know that now :joy:
 jacek: this one would work

 zhoubou: It doesn't work in playcode.io
 Toby75: it does for me lol

 zhoubou: It doesn't. You have the wrong inputs
 zhoubou: Inputs is an array of strings in the puzzle
 Toby75: oh now I get what you mean
 Toby75: that's probably the problem when coding without type definitions
 zhoubou: I'm proud of my 108 characters Python solution, and I'm not even a golfer :P
 Toby75: xD
 Toby75: python is just on another level
 zhoubou: Ikr
 jacek: mhm
 zhoubou: Gtg. Bye

 jacek: oO
 VizGhar: 4.3M points in 2048... 58M more and I'll be first :D
 Uljahn: guess 20M is doable in python
 VizGhar: I'm trying C++&#160;:) came with pretty fast eval function, but it's doing weird stuff after reaching 8192 tile&#160;:|
 darkhorse64: Signed/unsigned or overflow in eval
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 VizGhar: most probably...
 VizGhar: need to clear that spahgetti
 mzbear: i claimed ~100k score with a hardcoded DLDLDLDR-loop without even bothering to inspect the board state at any point ;D
 mzbear: couldn't quite decide on internal board representation format so i never really got started with it
 mzbear: the dreaded analysis paralysis ... sometimes it would be better to just start writing code instead of thinking too much
 VizGhar: 64 bits is nearly enough
 Westicles: Fun problem.  Only 14 of the cases can get the 131k tile (the rng needs to spit a 2 at the right time or it is impossible)
 Westicles: or maybe a 4, I forget which
 cazka: why is String.replaceAll() not a function in this IDE for JavaScript?
 struct: use replace
 struct: with global flag
 struct: replace(/a/g, 'b');
 cazka: thanks

 H.O.L.: Hi, is there any minimum waiting time between changing leagues? I am above Sebulboss in mad pod racing and there has been multiple timers with message "Those better than the Boss will be promoted to Gold League" but I am still in Silver league (first place).
 MrZee: If you beat the boss, there should be a timer at the top saying how long till you get promoted, I think silver to gold takes an hour
 H.O.L.: yes and I pass at least 3 timers (2am, 5am and now it is 7:59am - in my time zone). So next will be in 20 minutes, so I will wait but it is strange.

 elderlybeginner: New event (The Hidden Fortress): how to calculate amount of  combination for brute force?
 Darleanow: Hello guys, for code vs zombies, i'm trying to go to next zombiz x/y while id=min
 Darleanow: and when zombie count lowers from 1  change id to the next one
 Darleanow: but hwo can i associate zombie id with next zombie x/y
 GamingGnawer: most basically the amount of fortress configs should be 2^(n*n). i.e. all cells are either fotress or not
 5DN1L: Darleanow, not sure what you mean
 Darleanow: i mean that each zombie id is associated to a certain next_y and next_x, this is the way they go and kill human
 Darleanow: i'm trying to follow a zombie coordinates depending of it's id
 Darleanow: so i can focus the closer ones to humans
 5DN1L: do you store all the info in a list or dictionary or something?
 Darleanow: no, tbh i don't really know whats the approach of doing this,
 Darleanow: i need to count id's&#160;?
 Darleanow: maybe should i make a 2D array&#160;?
 5DN1L: as a start, go to any nearest human and protect him from there
 5DN1L: it's the minimum that can get you 100%
 Darleanow: i already did that
 Darleanow: by printing human_x and human_y 
 5DN1L: ah ok
 Darleanow: but i want to make it better&#160;!:)
 5DN1L: have you come up with any strategies?
 Hyper_star3301: hey guys can i have some help&#160;;-;
 Darleanow: what i know is that zombies focus the closest entity to them, with a priority for humans
 Darleanow: i will take aggro when i'm killing them as i'm getting closer
 Hyper_star3301: im stuck on second level of A.i :expressionless:
 Darleanow: it's the most difficult tbh 
 Darleanow: just try to do some easy puzzles&#160;:)
 Darleanow: i started ai like u but it's really hard past silver
 Hyper_star3301: i see
 Darleanow: i mean u need to understand a few things, so as everyone told me, u should do puzzles&#160;!!
 Darleanow: you can also do clash of code
 5DN1L: Darleanow it depends on whether you want to improve by using just if/then/else conditions, or if you want to start learning some algorithms e.g. genetic algorithm
 Darleanow: it can be really fun sometimes
 Darleanow: i'd like to dive into algorithm&#160;!!
 Hyper_star3301:  yup i was thinking  to do clash of codes and algorithms
 Darleanow: start with puzzles Hyper_star3301, when you're confident, you can go clash&#160;!! anyways jsut suggesting you can start with clash if you'd like
 Hyper_star3301: but A.i looks fun lmfao im using python 3 :joy:
 Darleanow: yeah it's cool&#160;!!!
 Darleanow: i'm using python too
 5DN1L: Darleanow, ok. You have to do two things: 1. write a simulation, so you can simulate an entire game from start to end (i.e. how Ash and the zombies move, how many humans are killed). 2. learn genetic algorithm, then implement it in this particular puzzle
 Darleanow: maybe you can go to bronze, i'm not really good, and even though i started with this, i managed to get silver&#160;! so you can do it too
 Darleanow: wdym by "write a simulation"&#160;??5DN1L
 Darleanow: i'll brb in 2 mins
 5DN1L: "write a simulation" means: you know the initial positions of Ash, the zombies and the humans. Your code should be able to calculate, if Ash moves to a particular location, what are the next state/positions of all of them
 5DN1L: You can do this puzzle as practice first: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/blunder-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/blunder-episode-1</a>
 Darleanow: okay thanks&#160;!!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Darleanow: BRO
 Darleanow: i wanna hug blunder
 Darleanow: hes so depressed&#160;:'(
 Adam_Sal: maybe
 Darleanow: okay so basically, i'm helping a robot to suicide, i feel so guilty
 Adam_Sal: That's not very nice of you
 Darleanow:&#160;:(
 Adam_Sal: You monster
 Darleanow:&#160;:((((
 Adam_Sal: You shall suffocate on your guilt
 Darleanow: x)
 5DN1L: No you misread it
 5DN1L: You are intercepting it
 5DN1L: not helping it
 Darleanow: OH OKAY
 Darleanow: it seems to be too hard for me atm 
 5DN1L: the statement is long, yes, but you can break it down by bits
 5DN1L: the test cases introduce new elements one by one
 5DN1L: so you can code for test case 1 first, when that succeeds, go on to add more to pass test case 2, and so on
 5DN1L: you don't have to code everything all at one go
 Darleanow: print("SOUTH")print("SOUTH")print("EAST")print("EAST")
 Darleanow: i did that for the first 
 Darleanow: which is the easiest one 
 5DN1L: don't hardcode it
 5DN1L: you need to do it similar to the Thor puzzle
 Darleanow: i need to make a function to locate $
 5DN1L: a bunch of if/else

 VizGhar: Hey guys... looking into simulated annealing, never implemented it before. How do I pick items from neighborhood If I'm working on multiple parameters?
 VizGhar: I'm just trying to generate "Hello World!" using SA on some random text (of same length as expected result)
 wlesavo: you just pick some letters and replace them with a random ones, or im not sure what you mean
 VizGhar: so i pick let's say 3 letters, replace them with random ones, evaluate them, checking temperature and moving on? I though I have to pick best from 10 random solutions or something
 VizGhar: It looks like too random&#160;:) I'll see 
 wlesavo: try starting with greedy algo, ie acepting attempt with stricktly better score, but yeah, your task seems too have way too many freedom
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: greedy sounds like hillclimbing for this case
 Wontonimo: what is the distance function you are using?
 wlesavo: i had somesthing simmilar in BnC2, it worked reasonably well 
 wlesavo: with scoring like B*10+C
 VizGhar: distance function is just simple distance in ascii table (nothing fancy)
 VizGhar: sum of distances for each character beween target and actual
 Mindarius: :taco: Mindarius
 Wontonimo: and when you make a change, is it just totally random,  gaussian, or small random&#160;?  
 VizGhar: total random
 VizGhar: I'll make one parameter only, I'll get the idea later on I hope
 VizGhar: this one will not converge
 Wontonimo: then it isn't Simulated Annealing.  For annealing, you need to lower the amount of random over time.  
 Wontonimo: In the beginning, maybe rand()*26 , then eventually rand()*25 ... 24 ...
 VizGhar: aaah that makes sense. I've been using it just for comparison of two solutions&#160;:)
 VizGhar: thanks. I have to go. I'll try it later
 Wontonimo: cool cool  bye!
 Wontonimo: btw, "annealing" means to lower the temperature gradually.  I this case the temperature means the amount of random disturbance.
 liuzhifeng123: :grin:
 TimberStalker: Why does codingame still use c#8. When do we get c#10.

 BadBurger: in kotlin, min() and max() does not work for me for some reason, (using it on list) but sum() average() and count() works. whaaat?

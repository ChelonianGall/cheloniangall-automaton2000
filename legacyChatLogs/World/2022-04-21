 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: is there any trailer for this competition?
 VizGhar: nope. but you can check any movie you like :P
 Bernard_Lowe: coding game day is almost here. I need a hype video.
 weebiss: hi
 Bernard_Lowe: For anyone who needs a hype video b/c there is one. Re-watch pac-man trailer and imagine it's for tomorrow&#160;:)

 Uljahn: no spam here
 Darleanow: Hello Uljahn&#160;:)
 Uljahn: hi
 Aa.spy: hellllllo
 Darleanow: guys need help
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b990c9d1-7470-46b5-899b-13114f6e2a29">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b990c9d1-7470-46b5-899b-13114f6e2a29</a>
 Darleanow: trying to use recursive function
 Darleanow: it returns the error :EX9.c:2:5: warning: type of 'a' defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int]
 Darleanow: when i try to compile it
 DaNinja: int findN(int a)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it wants you to typecast
 DaNinja: and you probably mean to return findN(a+(n-1));
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and n is not a global variable...so function should always just return a, because n isn't set
 DaNinja: true, n is undefined
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and making n=a before the scanf does nothing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google a recursive GCD function for a better idea of what you may be trying to do
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's some kind of sum of series from 1 to a^2, i can only guess
 Hanad: helo
 Hanad: i am quite humble.
 Hanad: n = 1
 Hanad: for(int i = 0; i&lt;int32.MaxValue
 ycsvenom: i solved a clash with the wrong idea and got 100% :smiley:
 ycsvenom: 5DN1L i texted someone here about something important but the important half of the conversation has been hided (or deleted), is there anyway to restore it?
 5DN1L:&#160;??? I'm not sure what you mean
 5DN1L: in the forum?
 5DN1L: PM?
 5DN1L: oh if you mean private chat, the older history is gone
 5DN1L: i don't think you can recover it
 VizGhar: You can't recover messages lost in this chat i believe
 VizGhar: 5DN1L will you attend this contest?
 5DN1L: i will, though i won't spend a lot of time on it&#160;:)
 pepper08: Hellooo wooorld!
 ycsvenom: yes i mean PM'ssadly 5DN1L
 Westicles: new versions of python and c++ just showed up
 Westicles: g++ (Debian 11.2.0-20) 11.2.0
 Westicles: Python 3.9.12
 ycsvenom: is it minor fixing or there is something new?
 Westicles: I think they are just updating some in time for the contest
 ycsvenom: you mean in this sitei thought you meant globally :sweat_smile:
 VizGhar: yey... email from CG&#160;:)
 VizGhar: links not working yet
 ycsvenom: why did you pixelate your profile picture VizGhar?
 VizGhar: ycsvenom H4ck3rm4n  :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The AI in the coffee machine doxxed him
 VizGhar: just a personal choice nothing fancy
 ycsvenom: should i do some forensics on the image &gt;_&lt; VizGhar
 VizGhar: go ahead ycsvenom

 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1 hrs 43mins to juice up
 derjack: and crash the server
 peerdb: lets goooooo
 struct: its starting earlier than usual?
 [CG]Thibaud: I believe the SC2021 started at the same time. Been 2 or 3 times that we start at 2pm UTC on Thursdays
 [CG]Thibaud: and hello&#160;:)
 struct: ah ok, hi
 struct: Will there be an introduction video like last time [CG]Thibaud&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: yes
 struct: nice
 [CG]Thibaud: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480</a>
 struct: oh even a pdf with rules
 struct: nice
 Astrobytes: no c++20&#160;! :o :P
 Astrobytes: great news on the PDF
 mag.py: No Rust update? :slight_frown: Do you not use rustup? Should make it very easy to do.
 Astrobytes: perhaps there are breaking changes, or some other issue
 [CG]Thibaud: that's the only one we might try. Looked a bit too big for just last minute, but could be ok. Focus on "might"
 mag.py: Can't think of anything recent. Rust tries very hard to be 100% backwards compatible.
 Astrobytes: [CG]Thibaud: so there won't be a C# update even post-contest? And hi&#160;:)
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't think so. Highly depends on CG for Work needs now, not much on community's&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Oh, that's a shame&#160;:(
 mag.py: @Thibaud Rust or C++? If you're updating Rust is there any chance you could add nalgebra as a library? Python has NumPy and that gives it a pretty big advantage for stuff like bots which tend to use lots of linear algebra.
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't think so. Also seems there are a few conflicts involved: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2021/prelude.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2021/prelude.html</a>
 Astrobytes: also, if you added a linear algebra lib for Rust, you'd have to do so for many other languages to keep it fair. 
 Astrobytes: python may have numpy but it's kinda slow performance-wise overall relative to Rust and C++ when it comes to applications of linear algebra in bot programming
 Uljahn: yep, python is interpreted, so it's fair to add Numba's JIT capabilities to it :smirk:
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 mag.py: I agree but linear algebra libs should just be standard for a "game" programming environment though surely?
 Astrobytes: well, it's not really game programming as such, just gamified platform
 Astrobytes: plus the bot programming
 Astrobytes: and not all the bot programming games involve use of linear algebra
 Uljahn: indeed
 BoBot: why does the competition start on Thursday this time? :D
 BoBot: I am so used to Friday I had to do a double check
 Astrobytes: it started on Thursday the previous one or two contests iirc
 BoBot: Wat? rly?
 BoBot: maybe I am just confused then
 Astrobytes: it has been a while since the last one&#160;;)
 AlekseiIvanov: is neural network necesary for the challenge?
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: ofc not
 AlekseiIvanov: to win?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the game and your goal
 AlekseiIvanov: I mean first place
 recurduck: how long time we have from the  spring challange start till it ends?
 eulerscheZahl: to win: possible, heavily depends on the game itself
 struct: depends on the game
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: the last contest was the first ever in CG history that was won by a NN
 AlekseiIvanov: uwu
 eulerscheZahl: or the 2nd to last, if you count the escape
 BoBot: wow, I was going to ask if a NN has ever been a top contender
 struct: recurduck it ends on May 2nd at 8 am UTC
 recurduck: thanks! 
 struct: Also the guy that won with a NN had won contests before
 eulerscheZahl: recurduck, is that a reCurse in hiding mode?
 struct: lol
 BoBot: if it looks like a duck...
 Astrobytes: and won BitRunner 2048 informal contest with a NN
 recurduck: actualy yes haha
 recurduck: have you ever heard about duck debbuging?
 eulerscheZahl: rubber duck?
 BoBot: sounds like something people starting to go mad would do
 Astrobytes: I use a stone duck, better for the environment
 BoBot: (speaking to inanimate objects)
 Harou: Hi, anyone knows how to run the game locally, and code with VS code?
 mag.py: @Uljahn If Numba being added? If Python were to have NumPy *and* Numba then surely at that point NumPy would clearly be an unfair advantage compared to all other languages?
 mag.py: is*
 BoBot: shouldn't someone with a name mag.py be in favor of that? :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: mag.py: I think that was the point&#160;;)
 Uljahn: mag.py: numpy is good to have, but you rarely can vectorize everything without regressing to python datatypes which causes huge overheads
 recurduck: so that why i call myseld recurduck we are developers debbuging all the time..like a recursion
 p3d3str1an: Harou: there is a sync extension/chrome app for that, but the input is manual
 TheQuestion: considering i am getting to silver with just simple if-statements, i would say no :D
 Thorcode: can in mad 
 Thorcode: and not even silver gold is possible with simple  if else
 Harou: :thumbsup_tone1:
 Thorcode: want some hint?
 eulerscheZahl: can you give a hint already, before it even started?
 Thorcode: nah i just say to some guy
 Thorcode: how can you level higher than westicle with lower puzzle solved?
 mag.py: @Thibaud The new Rust edition changes should only really cause conflicts if people have been manually implementing TryFrom and TryInto, which is very unlikely.
 eulerscheZahl: if it's not needed for CG for work too, you need better arguments
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: "how can you level higher than westicle with lower puzzle solved?"contest points, puzzle creation+upvote farming
 Danzou: Anyone knows how long it will last?
 eulerscheZahl: 10-11 days
 Danzou: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: not a multiple of 24h
 Danzou: Nah I thought it will last for 48H
 eulerscheZahl: ends May 2nd 10am CEST
 Danzou: And I am out couldn't participate and was sad
 Danzou: But now I am happy
 Tryst: euler how do you pronounce your name?
 eulerscheZahl: like in the english "oiler"
 Tryst: ah okay
 Tryst: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: go to google translate and ask the bot to pronounce the rest
 Astrobytes: think pronunciation of "deutsche"
 eulerscheZahl: if you know how to pronounce that...
 Astrobytes: I would hope most people should at *least* know that
 eulerscheZahl: "h as in hour""k as in knight"
 eulerscheZahl: just as helpful
 eulerscheZahl: "p as in psyche"
 eulerscheZahl: found it hilarious when kitboga did that to read out a gift code
 Astrobytes: Are people no longer taught the correct names of countries as children? (as in, in that country's language)
 VizGhar: i like those silent letters... like h in hour... or ueue in queue
 jrke: today after long time i will be going to try bot programming :grinning:
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: :rofl: good one!
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know to to say Poland in Polish for instance. probably the same for other countries
 Astrobytes: jrke: same for a lot of us
 Astrobytes: Polska is Polish for Poland
 eulerscheZahl: today after long time i will be going to try programming :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: fixed it
 eulerscheZahl: do i still have an IDE installed?
 jrke: :grinning:
 vvandenb: :grinning
 vvandenb: :grinning:
 jacek: :upside_down:
 dreadylein: ide isnt strictly needed i guess :P
 Astrobytes: oh, Mathis has done an intro video
 Hjax: i cant say i know many countries names in their native languages 
 TheQuestion: yeah, i know a large amount in per language, but not in their native one
 Astrobytes: tbf it's not overly useful
 eulerscheZahl: i know "United States of America" in their language
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: project is set up, i'm ready to code
 AndreMarasca: 20 minutes
 TheQuestion: i mean, as i found out only recently, Czech Republic is Czechia now
 Tryst: good luck to everyone in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: wait until it becomes czechoslovakia again
 Astrobytes: that will NOT happen
 eulerscheZahl: wishing good luck to everyone? but we can't all win, how is that supposed to work?
 VizGhar: Let's not get political :P
 Tryst: I just hope that everyone improves their score from last year
 TheQuestion: honestly, i always joke, it should have been 3 states :D Bohemia, Moravia + BA and the rest of Slovakia ^^
 VizGhar: I'm taking luck with me
 Tryst: Not necessarily hoping everyone wins
 Astrobytes: lol 
 eulerscheZahl: it's also not possible that we all improve
 Topjimmies: I'm from czechoslovakia
 Tryst: That's why i said **hope**
 eulerscheZahl: except if we all improve by 1 and the winner decides to not play at all
 IvesL: 15 mins left
 JASch: on codingame everyone wins (... at least xp&#160;;) )
 jacek: get your participation medals ready
 TheQuestion: i am just aiming this time to make a functioning prediction machine, instead of just static rules
 jrke: i am just aiming to do something atleast
 jrke: totally out of practice from bot prog
 jrke: from nearly 1 year
 Astrobytes: it'll come back jrke
 jrke: :sweat_smile:
 Kellthazar: I'll attend this one using Golang&#160;:)
 Tryst: I think I'm gonna try to use C for this contest

 VizGhar: I'll get to legend and then submit in whatever language isn't present to get sweet exp :D
 struct: and then get removed from the leaderboard&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: a few years ago that was a way to win a tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: back when there was top50 + first in a language
 VizGhar: :D really?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, long ago
 VizGhar: euler. You wont need smurf account this time... you must be happy
 eulerscheZahl: they changed that with the introduction of community contests - namely Mean Max
 eulerscheZahl: it all has its good sides
 jrke: but now there are no more community contests right?
 eulerscheZahl: won't play for too long today, only a quick peek and bronze maybe. then :soccer:
 eulerscheZahl: right jrke&#160;:(
 jrke: :neutral_face:
 eulerscheZahl: let's enjoy what we have and make the best out of it
 jrke: yup
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed. I'm grateful there is any contest at all&#160;:)
 Joe0: what's the fastest clash of code score in fastest mode of all time?
 kovi: gl except for rec...he may not need it
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 jrke: Astrobytes&#160;: yes atleast bot prog
 Astrobytes: hello kovi
 jrke: rec is really a curse
 jrke: on us
 eulerscheZahl: open a random leaderboard and check the green dots for online players. it really is contest time again
 aCat: yeeeeah contest time&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: legend or delete?
 TheQuestion: let the stress testing of the server begin!
 Astrobytes: haha
 eulerscheZahl: that's how we should feature a community contest
 eulerscheZahl: server stress test event
 Astrobytes: :D
 Ajaiy: yaaaaay
 schachmatt: plot twist the contest actually starts tomorrow, today is just a stress test
 eulerscheZahl: great, now the cat wakes up and wants petting
 jacek: checkmate
 Mortis_666: â 
 dbdr: did you get a week holiday eulerscheZahl?&#160;;)
 Ajaiy: go go go
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 IvesL: looks fancy
 wlesavo: hoho
 Ajaiy: Yeah
 jrke: lol nice league opening time
 schachmatt: love that posix timestamp
 Hjax: oh i like this already 
 dbdr: we are all doomed!
 Astrobytes: enjoy&#160;:)
 Ajaiy: Looks like some kind of fight thing
 Hjax: looks like a nice straight forward game 
 dbdr: inb4 eulerscheZahl top 3

 dbdr: looks like a unix timestamp
 Ajaiy: ikr
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: not a grid game
 Jerrasterix: hmm achievements has started to slow down 
 Ajaiy: OohI got Trimestrial Killer
 DomiKo: Fog of War mmmmm
 BoBot: aww...why are they spiders...I like spiders
 struct: time to delete
 Astrobytes: fog of war
 DomiKo: struct true
 IvesL: why are iron mans killing spiders
 Ajaiy: The only challenge for Wood is that the base is a line and not a point
 Ajaiy: So calculating the euclidean distance would be difficult
 Smelty: interesting contest 
 eulerscheZahl: camping at the own base should be enough to pass wood1
 Astrobytes: codebusters-ish
 KelvinAndHubbles: how do you tell which command is being issued to which hero? 
 struct: its in order
 Astrobytes: and there's a debug overlay in the viewer if you want to track things visually
 Hugesn0wduck: hii yall
 Uljahn: "calculating the euclidean distance would be difficult"wow. linear algebra time :smiley:
 Hugesn0wduck: just finished creating my art website
 Astrobytes: Uljahn: :rofl:
 TheQuestion: hmm, purple spiders dont like campers :P
 Hjax: ok threw a quick base guarding bot together 
 Hjax: best i can manage from work, ill do something proper tonight 
 Iugi: how does the move command work?
 Hjax: MOVE X Y 
 struct: no collisions?
 struct: :p
 eulerscheZahl: is it just me or are the images in the pdf missing? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/0DZ9NOb.png">https://i.imgur.com/0DZ9NOb.png</a>
 Hjax: not currently 
 Hjax: my heroes just stack up right now and chase the closest enemy in the base radius 
 eulerscheZahl: mine camp at 700,700 (or mirrored for bottom corner), enough to promote
 eulerscheZahl: int delta = -700;if (baseX == 0) delta = 700;Console.WriteLine($"MOVE {baseX + delta} {baseY + delta}");
 jrke: same here Hjax
 jrke: nearest monster to my base
 blasterpoard: I had something similar, it's random whether you promote with it or not
 KalamariKing: quite a challenge
 KalamariKing: intereting
 BoBot: you are already writing more efficient code than I...I created constants for the bottom base location...
 Hjax: well, i dont even do nearest monster to my base lol, i just do a random one in that base radius 
 Hjax: good enough to promote 
 DomiKo: no referee code this time?
 jrke: maybe in bronze DomiKo
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022</a>
 _Lupus_: About the spring challenge: The action order is: Heroes move, monsters take damage, monsters die, monsters attack. But when do the monsters move? Before or after the heroes. It's not clear from the description (or I missed it)
 jrke: or just check CG github acc
 DomiKo: thx
 dbdr: rules for wood 1?
 eulerscheZahl: Fog makes it impossible to know the positions of all monsters and rival heroes. You need to have them within 2200 units from one of your heroes or 6000 from your base.
 eulerscheZahl: SPELL, followed by a spell action, as detailed in the Spells section further below.
 eulerscheZahl: If a monster is pushed (with a WIND command) outside the radius of a targeted base, it will stop targeting and start moving in a randomly selected direction.
 eulerscheZahl: and some mana explanation on wind
 eulerscheZahl: WIND	&lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;	All entities (except your own heroes) within 1280 units are pushed 2200 units in the direction from the spellcaster to x,y.
 dbdr: thanks!
 schachmatt: servers are holding up surprisingly well
 DomiKo: then there will be CONTROL and SHIELD spell
 DomiKo: and nothing more
 eulerscheZahl: looks like my base camping might get me directly into bronze
 Darleanow: is there a better way to solve <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ascii-art">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ascii-art</a>
 BoBot: haha so we will start pushing monsters to opponents! :D
 Darleanow: instead of making a dict 
 Darleanow:&#160;?
 DomiKo: euler delta 500 gets to bronze too
 eulerscheZahl: did you solve it already? then you have access to other solutions to learn from
 MindController: BoBot direction after push seems to be random
 TheQuestion: this just went from castle defense to shaolin soccer
 eulerscheZahl: 700 is my magic number
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:?
 Darleanow: no i didnt solved it already, this is why i'm asking&#160;:)
 DomiKo: yours is better than mine
 eulerscheZahl: because i'm a toad
 eulerscheZahl: everyone knows that toads eat spiders
 Jerrasterix: lol
 _Lupus_: Found the answer to my earlier question: Heroes move first, then monsters (before new monsters spawn)
 Smelty: yes
 TheQuestion: question, the yellow circles around the base are the lock-on borders for the enemies?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Smelty: no, because the enemies lock on before they reach that i think
 Smelty: oh
 Jerrasterix: bruhh.... I forgot to add an else statemen... very silly of me 
 Smelty: you can try using threatFor to determine what would be dangerous and you should attack
 TheQuestion: well, camping isnt working out, have to actually try now ^^
 AshKetchum: guys, the league opening time is being shown as a big integer
 Smelty: just camp and attack any that get too close
 Jerrasterix: I am just attacking the closest monster to the base 
 Jerrasterix: doing pretty well 
 Smelty: im just attacking the first 3 inputted threatfors
 Smelty: doing pretty well
 WannaBeHum1n: guys
 Smelty: yes&gt;
 Dapps: Seems like a fun challenge. Have there been previous ones similar to this?
 BoBot:         # is_controlled: Ignore for this league; Equals 1 when this entity is under a control spell
 Jerrasterix: yup, code vs zombies 
 eulerscheZahl: i'd say code busters, code royale
 Dapps:&#160;:) okay so a few lol
 eulerscheZahl: my base camping might not make it to bronze in the end&#160;:(
 Topjimmies: my code looks like it should work, but my guys only attack the enemies at the bottom middle of the screen
 Jerrasterix: I just copy pasted my code from my CvZ
 Topjimmies: :thinking:
 Smelty: i feel like camping and only attacking those who are locked on are a little late
 Smelty: hmm im 23rd rn and 40% battles
 WannaBeHum1n: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 WannaBeHum1n: i try to print my base coordinates
 WannaBeHum1n: and i get this
 Smelty: that may be because you outputted multiple moves in the for loop
 WannaBeHum1n: ahhhhhhhhhhh
 WannaBeHum1n: ty
 Smelty: check the output for loop, it should only have 1 output as it is a for loop for each of the heroes
 Jerrasterix: WannaBeHum1n try printing it to debug 
 Dapps: i get that if i forget to output to console error
 WannaBeHum1n: THNX ALL
 RSBat: boss 1 is on position 95 in wood 2 right now
 Smelty: xd
 Jerrasterix: lol
 Remus_: What python3 version is used?
 Smelty: im tying against the boss rn
 Smelty: nvm just won
 KelvinAndHubbles: 3.9.12 python
 KelvinAndHubbles: Not 3.10 yet
 Remus_: Thanks!
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh boy derust time
 Smelty: owo
 BenjaminUrquhart: I haven't touched codingame in like a year this will go well
 Smelty: nice!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn Ben
 eulerscheZahl: BenjaminUrquhart where is my shrine?
 Smelty: boss is on 94th place in wood league
 Astrobytes: :D
 WannaBeHum1n: why is hte health in a loop guys&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: health and mana
 Astrobytes: because its variable?
 KelvinAndHubbles: because there are two players
 struct: yours and opponent
 Smelty: you need to get the new data each turn to output it?
 struct: I guess
 WannaBeHum1n: ohhhhh mines and my opponents
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx
 struct:  // Your base health
 struct: this might seem confusing though
 WannaBeHum1n: yeah
 WannaBeHum1n: the comment
 WannaBeHum1n: so mine is xhen i == 0 right&#160;?
 Smelty: hmm im 73rd but above boss
 Smelty: how many wood leagues are there
 Hjax: two
 Astrobytes: 2
 Smelty: thanks
 jacek: in morning 3 :smirk:
 Smelty: maybe i can make it to bronze with current code o-o
 struct: jacek will win this one
 Smelty: the odds are on him
 nugghead: vous le faites en ql language les gars 
 struct: #fr
 Astrobytes: #fr&#160;;)
 nugghead: ow sorry wrong chat 
 Smelty: fs
 struct: lots of rng
 SashaNukem: jo mah dues and dudets
 jacek: hm?
 Fanfouer: How do you link to another conv like fr? @struct @Astrobytes
 SashaNukem: GL HF
 jacek: Fanfouer like #taco?
 Fanfouer: Yep
 Smelty: #taco kool
 Fanfouer: #taco
 Fanfouer: Ah-
 struct: or you can do /join fr
 SashaNukem: what does this mean For this challenge, multiple leagues for the same game are available.&#160;?
 Fanfouer: And how to @someone?
 SashaNukem: aaa
 Astrobytes: just typing their name is enough
 Astrobytes: Fanfouer
 Fanfouer: SashaNukem =&gt; there will be multiple difficulties
 Fanfouer: Writing Astrobytes is enough then, got it. Thanks!
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 TheQuestion: the boss of wood 1 is nice, he actually came over and helped me kill some stuff
 Asterixk: bruh!League opening: 1650812400000
 Natanalel: how can I remove rubocop? it's super annoying
 zakacat: Are we allowed to ask people look at our contribution in chat? lol
 Topjimmies: can you switch sides for your code test?
 eulerscheZahl: yes zakacat but it can backfire to harsh criticism
 eulerscheZahl: yes Topjimmies. remove yourself and the opponent. than add again in reverse order
 eulerscheZahl: "delete" below the profile pics
 Topjimmies: awesome, thank you
 aCat: auch euler right - no images in pdfs&#160;;/
 VaseSimion: Noob question: to progress you just need to be ranked above the boss, and finish the battle simulations to 100%. right? even if you are rank 100+
 Darleanow: yes, there's a battle system
 Darleanow: it depends on the score you get
 struct: here aCat
 Darleanow: if u beat the other players with your score
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/PorlF1b.png">https://i.imgur.com/PorlF1b.png</a>
 VaseSimion: Yeah, but usually the bos was in top 5 and now it just feels weird
 Darleanow: you gon rank up
 aCat:&#160;:*
 Darleanow: yes, because some people do have a better code than the bot
 eulerscheZahl: it's normal that the boss is low early in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: then good players promote and the boss is at the top of the league
 Smelty: yes, then the good people generally get past and then the boss gets back to the top
 eulerscheZahl: all depends on mow many submit at the same time
 TheQuestion: it just takes a bit of time for people to bubble upwards, then the bot gets back to top5
 Smelty: the battles in progress taking so long&#160;:(
 Smelty: still at 60% but im probably going to promote
 Astrobytes: it is a contest...
 TheQuestion: server melting :D
 TheQuestion: i think i will grab dinner, should hopefully finish until then&#160;:)
 Thheo: does wind change the direction of a monster?
 Maciulis: still dont understand why in competition mode cg needs to evaluate 100 games of standing in one spot
 Thheo: nvm i read it does
 TheQuestion: Thheo, if its far enough to be outside the circle, it looses the lock, otherwise it will just keep coming
 schachmatt: has anyoe managed to compile the referee for brutaltester yet?
 Thheo: ty
 linjoehan: Ohohoh it's that time of the year again
 Smelty: xd
 Mindarius: is by base x,y always 0,0?
 Mindarius: my*
 martinkozle: no
 Topjimmies: no, sometimes it is on the opposite side
 Mindarius: is there a good way to tell where it is?
 Mindarius: nvm
 martinkozle: first line of input
 Maciulis: you have given param base_x base_y
 Mindarius: yeah
 Mindarius: I just noticed that
 Mindarius: thanks
 Smelty: 93% battles in progress lel
 Smelty: pog finally promoted
 Hjax: the start time of these contests always leaves me sitting at work daydreaming all day 
 Dapps: it's true
 Dapps: then i'm done work and i have all these ideas... but i'm too tired to code them lol
 aCat: debug visualization should have attack radius
 Wizard-Dude: yes , definitly, I was just wondering if we could output how many enemies were in our attack radius?
 Topjimmies: you can do that yourself
 aCat: you can print it on stderr, etc
 Topjimmies: 800 units is attack range
 aCat: site is not responsive&#160;?&#160;;]
 cegprakash: Too tanky zombies lolol
 WannaBeHum1n: guys how long does it usually take 4 u 
 WannaBeHum1n: to finish the battles
 schachmatt: centuries
 Hjax: oh the control spell redirects monsters forever, they keep running in the same direction you sent them in
 Hjax: thats useful 
 Smelty: haha my wood 1 code is above the boss 2 even though it doesnt incorporate wind
 Hjax: im rank 17 bronze right now and all i do is charge at the closest monster to my base 
 Hjax: spells are optional :P
 Smelty: pro
 Smelty: im 72nd in wood 2 , way above boss
 Smelty: just waiting for batles to finish
 InstantWin: is passing wind the only spell?
 WannaBeHum1n: it is been in 37 percent for 20mins
 Smelty: mine is 38
 WannaBeHum1n: is my internet the problem&#160;?
 Hjax: theres 3 spells in bronze
 Smelty: wind isnt the only one later there's control spell
 Smelty: and others
 Hjax: wind, control, and shield 
 blasterpoard: control is probably useless tho
 Hjax: i dont think it is blasterpoard
 Hjax: it redirects a monsters walking direction too, the spec isnt clear on that 
 Hjax: simon is just sending waves of monsters at his opponents 
 blasterpoard: Hjax how does it interact with a spider getting triple-wind-yeeted to your base?
 Smelty: lolol
 blasterpoard: that's where this game is going
 Smelty: L + wind yeeted + controlled
 Hjax: that is true but control is probably handy to set up those plays 
 blasterpoard: no, it moves epiders less then wind does
 Hjax: shielding monsters to prevent them from getting "wind yeeted" will probably also be a thing 
 blasterpoard: exactly
 blasterpoard: get some mana, use it only on wind and shield
 Hjax: it moves spiders less in one turn, but more given a handful of turns 
 Hjax: people will clear the spiders near their base 
 mester_x: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.&#160;?????????
 struct: are you outputing before reading all inputs?
 mester_x: no
 FinnKrause: hello guys
 mester_x: are you can see to me cod
 casmith789: are you running more than 3 lines of output each turn?
 jjjjjjjtgpptmjj: can anyone build local battle java project?
 mester_x: yes
 mester_x: casmith
 mester_x: i need help
 casmith789: only run 3 lines of output, 1 for each hero and you won't get that problem
 mester_x: it is 3
 mester_x: :head_bandage:
 mester_x: :rage:
 TheQuestion: just mentioning, cause i did the mistake myself, the example code has the return in a loop. So just check if you are not returning 3x3 results like i did&#160;:)
 Christbutbetter: yhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 Christbutbetter: ty
 cythonboy: hi
 Topjimmies: end game strat is just shoving all the enemies into the opponent  base lol
 Topjimmies: I love it
 Smelty: xd
 cythonboy: yep
 Smelty: what is wild mana
 TheQuestion: cant shove if you are walking away from me :D
 TheQuestion: Smelty: In case of a tie, the player who gained the highest amount of mana outside the radius of their base will win. this is called wild mana. 
 cythonboy: o
 a-Rye: Lotta cool stuff with the contest! For anyone that missed it, VizGhar was streaming some contest work earlier. He's at 30 followers, it requires 50 to become affiliate. Consider supporting him by following him at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/vizghar">https://www.twitch.tv/vizghar</a>
 schachmatt: has anyone managed to compiled the referee for brutaltester?
 yhyoxx: classic schachmatt
 schachmatt:&#160;?
 VizGhar: a-Rye I was streaming in slovak :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 31 now, not that I will watch lol
 struct: It would be nice to have wild mana given on the viewer
 a-Rye: VizGhar I was watching all the same lol. It takes courage to stream coding, so I try to follow anyone gutsy enough to do it here on CodinGame
 Illedan: Anyone in bronze to confirm if you can use multiple winds at the same time? ( to blow something further away)
 a-Rye: and PatrickMcGinnisll that still helps a lot! Or even leaving their videos playing with the sound way low still earns them ad revenue
 blasterpoard: Illedan yes, you can
 Illedan: ty
 Illedan: Will they overshoot the base if they are too close?
 blasterpoard: afaik no, but I didn't test it specifically
 struct: if its within base radius it has collision
 struct: with wall I think
 mester_x: I couldn't do anything today. lol 
 a-Rye: I speak English and Spanish, but I'm watching KimiNako code in French. I'm still following the code, just have no idea what's being said
 Astrobytes: "A monster can be pushed outside of the map, unless it is within a base radius, in which case it will will be moved no further than the border."
 Illedan: Thx&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: np
 PatrickMcGinnisII: A stream in java... ok, if it was PY I wouldn't follow
 Illedan: The pdf statement is images and can't be searched&#160;:(
 ninjadip: you can't push me
 blasterpoard: well, statement is not really that helpful anyway because of edge cases
 mester_x: I couldn't install darknet because of nvidia and my code didn't work:sob:
 a-Rye: Yeah, I've been streaming mostly python, but I'm putting in a lot of hours with my Beginner Java Concepts playground trying to do the language justice. C++ is next, but so complicated to compile the dockers
 mester_x: No one is helping 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mester_x prolly don't use what you r trying to use
 struct: everyone is busy with the contest
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: mester_x , go to watch their streaming
 Wontonimo: is this going to be somewhat like ghostbuster?
 Astrobytes: there are similarities
 Wontonimo: are you enjoying it?
 cegprakash: health and mana I'm always player 0 or I need to find based on my base??
 Wontonimo: I'm still at work, just stopping in for 5 min
 Wizard-Dude: for some reason, whenever I output my mana, it keeps on dropping, and I am not using a wind or any other type of spell?   
 Astrobytes: early days yet
 mester_x: I'm sorry I didn't know you were busy
 WannaBeHum1n: WOOD 1 LESS GO
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 100 lines of code just for data structures, not so much...yet
 WannaBeHum1n: XD
 Astrobytes: it's a very easy bronze at least
 Wontonimo: it's a contest week, everryone will be super busy
 TheQuestion: Ceg, your health and mana should always be first
 cegprakash: thx TheQuestion
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: you never change :D
 Wontonimo: Good luck Astrobytes and struct&#160;!
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: FROM THE STATEMENT:First 2 lines: two integers baseHealth and mana for the remaining health and mana for both players. Your data is always given first.
 Joe0: Hey i'm doing the spring challenge and it doesn't seem to specify what order to output the moves for each hero (ex: how do I specify I want the hero with _id such and such to move?)
 struct: thanks, gl Wontonimo
 TheQuestion: it is in order, Joe0
 Astrobytes: +1
 Joe0: what order?
 Joe0: in the order the entities are presented as input?
 _Lupus_: In the order of hero ids
 Wontonimo: order by id
 Topjimmies: can't use match case? :joy:
 Joe0: and the id is a number?
 _Lupus_: yes
 Joe0: thx
 Wontonimo: hey Joe0 (and others listening) you can get all this infor in the instructions on the left
 Wontonimo: just scroll down
 Wontonimo: it's all there in text
 TheQuestion: so, bronze was very straightforward with literally just camping and a spell use :P now i can spend a couple of days making a proper bot that will be a third as efficient ^^
 cegprakash: unable to blew the spiders out off the board lol
 cegprakash: my strat failed
 Astrobytes: think simple
 Astrobytes: to get to bronze
 SabertheLost: what leagues are open?
 Astrobytes: Only BRonze
 VizGhar: wood and bronze
 VizGhar: silver will open later (monday maybe?)
 TheQuestion: silver+ will be only dividing players though, no new rules, right?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: silver opens at: 1650812400000 :D
 VizGhar: precisely
 NinjaDoggy: Ah yes at 1650812400000 :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 TheQuestion: Sunday, April 24, 2022 5:00:00 PM GMT+02:00 DST
 Wizard-Dude: Hello, How would I be able to find my mana, for some reason whenever I use what they have given me, I get numbers that are not equal to what is being displayed at the top of my screen?
 VizGhar: your mana is second input during game turn
 NinjaDoggy: That sounds like a out of sync issue? Make sure you only output 3 lines each turn I guess
 TheQuestion: there could be in theory a clash, cause you first do damage (and gain mana) and then use WIND, but it is still after commands are issued 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mobs with hp&gt;18 have to be ridden like a spider in minecraft
 Wizard-Dude: I don't think so, This is a replay of a game and my mana is displayed on top of my hero's <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621155505">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621155505</a> 
 struct: you are displaying opponent mana
 Astrobytes: read the statement carefully
 Wizard-Dude: oh , Thanks!
 Astrobytes: we need wonto's bot to output RTFS!!! automatically
 a-Rye: I habitually forget to RTFS when clashing...
 Astrobytes: that sounds... counterproductive :D
 a-Rye: for clashing you can get away with it. I've guessed at some and won. But for this challenge...no I intend on reading all the instructions :grin:
 TheQuestion: there should just be a "Ignore everything and just output Hello World" at the end of one these :D
 a-Rye: Same with resistcorp, he's at 16 followers and needs that 50 to be affiliate. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/resistcorp">https://www.twitch.tv/resistcorp</a>
 CoolandonRS: I'm just starting in the challenge right now, and I'm getting a "3" as a second line of input and can't seem to find what it maps to. Any of you know?
 Astrobytes: heroes per player
 VizGhar: base health
 CoolandonRS: Ah, thanks
 CoolandonRS: Is that initilization or game loop?
 Astrobytes: init
 VizGhar: initialization is 2 ints baseX and baseY
 CoolandonRS: Don't see that in the description, thanks for your help.
 VizGhar: 3rd input is baseHealth = 3
 Astrobytes: + heroes_per_player
 Astrobytes: int heroes_per_player; // Always 3
 VizGhar: aha
 VizGhar: sry
 VizGhar: you are right
 Astrobytes: np&#160;:)
 VizGhar: Its not mentioned in rules tho :P
 jrke: i think heuristics can be good in this type of game
 Astrobytes: yeah, I think it's been pointed out somewhere already
 Smelty: yey im in bronze
 Smelty: using my wood 1 code
 NinjaDoggy: Is there a link to the GitHub for this contest somewhere?
 CoolandonRS: Yeah. That messed me up since I like to recreate the input. All times hero count is mentioned its formatted as a constant of 3
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022</a>
 NinjaDoggy: Not much to do while waiting for promotion&#160;:(
 VaseSimion: Boss 1 and Boss 2 can be beaten by the same code it seems&#160;:)
 VizGhar: NinjaDoggy make yourself cofee&#160;:)
 Audran227: anyone doing spring challenge 2022&#160;??
 Wontonimo: everyone
 Astrobytes: everybody?
 Smelty: is first input of health/mana yours
 Astrobytes: rtfs
 Smelty: o-o
 Djellowman: battles taking forever
 Wontonimo: if forever means an hour
 Djellowman: yes, that's what it means i read it somewhere
 Djellowman: i just started
 Smelty: how do you output the spell? do you just use "SPELL x y"?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 11 minutes since first submit @66% complete
 tomiesz: @Smelty it's SPELL &lt;Spell name&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;
 Smelty: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like 200+ people gonna get dumped into wood1 shortly
 Wontonimo: it's in the documentation on the left
 Smelty: so do you do "SPELL CONTROL 13"
 Smelty: as the id
 tomiesz: didnt get to control yet, cant help. BUt the exercise should have the details in the spell section 
 Djellowman: i'm one of them
 Wontonimo: scroll down to the bottom Smelty
 Smelty: yes still not sure about control
 Smelty: but the rest is good :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: oh, i like the broken heart animation.  that's a nice flair
 DaNinja: real programmers never read the statement
 Smelty: just trial and error
 Djellowman: ninjas don't write documentation
 DaNinja: code comments are overrated
 Smelty: hmm
 tobk: Are there any special requirements to the contest game viewer? Only gray for me.&#160;:-( (rather old laptop with bad Intel graphics, Linux)
 Smelty: weird
 Smelty: also im losing to default bot cuz he wind-camps me
 Darleanow: Hello wonto&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: hey Darle
 Darleanow: ahhahaha
 Darleanow: u can call me Enzo&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: baseline for you Wontonimo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621184483">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621184483</a>
 Darleanow: or print("enzo"[0:2]
 Darleanow: )
 SabertheLost: why is the new rules not marked out as they normaly are when switching ranks&#160;?
 Wontonimo: nice replay PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;!
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine</a>
 Darleanow: imma do this one :p
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: the boss is really kind~ 
 Mindarius: how far is hero sightline on wood 1?
 Mindarius: nbm
 Mindarius: nvm*
 Mindarius: 2200 hero, 6000 base
 Wontonimo: oh, i'm 218th but ahead of the boss&#160;?!?  wild
 Hjax: the wood bosses usually spend the first few hours getting demolished while the ranks stabilize 
 Wontonimo: that's sure is going to be a lot of promotion in the next bit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 86% waiting for promote
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er me...yup 200+ gonna jump
 NickSaidSomethingWonderful: the boss tries to blow some monster to my base..
 Smelty: ye thats their strat
 Scarfield: the wood bosses should be easy though, so it should be that way really. but the submission times will hurt from it
 Smelty: wood bosses are quite easy ngl
 Smelty: you don't even need to use spells
 Wontonimo: really, just promote no.1 immediately if there are more than 50 above the boss, and repeat
 Wontonimo: why 213?
 Hjax: its fine, it will stabilize in a bit
 Wontonimo: just wasted compute
 Smelty: wait what is wild mana
 Scarfield: sure CG could optimize it
 Hjax: Smelty mana earned outside of your base, used as a tiebreaker
 Scarfield: mana gained outside of you base zone i thinkg
 Wontonimo: i'm babbling ... i know it isn't gonna change
 Scarfield: ^
 Smelty: ok
 Scarfield: cant have it all&#160;;)
 Smelty: ngl i feel like strat is to have 1 guy wind-yeeting enemies at opponent's base
 Scarfield: and it shouldnt last for that long, it is slightly annoying for sure though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have gotten stuck in wood league for a bit because i didn't submit the first day in other contests, but these bosses look kinda easy so far
 Hjax: if you have 3 guys wind yeeting the monster fly three times as far Smelty
 Smelty: yes
 Wontonimo: honestly, I'm gonna say this multi looks fun.   Really looks like a reflex bot can have a good time
 Smelty: ye
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gonna get smelly, alot of farts
 Wontonimo:&#160;?!?
 Astrobytes: wind...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: from everyone passing gas (wind)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: full rules in the git?
 Darleanow: WONTO UR PUZZLE IS EASY :o
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MOVE, WIND, SHIELD, CONTROL, IDLE; that it?
 struct: yes
 struct: and wait
 Hjax: im really liking how straight forward this game is 
 Wontonimo: +1
 Mindarius: same
 Wontonimo: kinda borrowed from Botters it seems
 SabertheLost: I just move 600/600 then attack anything that get close and use wind
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh fog of war
 Scarfield: how is the fog of war implemented? still waiting for rank up
 Smelty: tbf im gonna be stuck in bronze until i do a redo of my code
 Smelty: its basically you can see in a radius around your base and your heroes
 Scarfield: ah just ranked up&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i'm still at 70% complete for wood 1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Fog makes it impossible to know the positions of all monsters and rival heroes. You need to have them within 2200 units from one of your heroes or 6000 from your base. 
 matteo1123: this is an awesome challenge, first time I've ever done anything like this
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/444ef79f-fddd-44f6-90c4-9aaecbede9d1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/444ef79f-fddd-44f6-90c4-9aaecbede9d1</a>
 surgutti: does CONTROL spell also work on enemy heroes?
 NinjaDoggy: also can you shield monsters?
 cegprakash: where u wanna blow the enemy hero surgutti :P
 AlMualem: NinjaDoggy i suppose you can shield an monster so that it cant be pushed towards your base...maybe
 NinjaDoggy: nonono, you push the monster and shield it on the same turn towards ur opponent base
 NinjaDoggy: then if they can't kill it fast enough they lose&#160;:)
 MaxTheorum: when will silver be opened?
 NinjaDoggy: at 1650812400000&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 yhyoxx: Sunday 24 April 2022 14:59:57.808
 MaxTheorum: cheers!
 AlMualem: wait...if i push and after the push the monster is still in my base radius it will still "attack" my base right?
 tomiesz: yep
 AlMualem: on the contrary, if i push it outside the base it will get a random direction
 tomiesz: yes
 AlMualem: this Hero3 it ultra annoying in Bronze :P
 AlMualem: i am like "come on man,mind your own base!Leave me alone!"
 Topjimmies: this dude, going into my base and blowing my  heroes into the opposite corner :fearful:
 Wontonimo: haha
 nightwalkerinthedark: sup world
 Topjimmies: just waiting for promotion
 AlMualem: i am thinking how to deal with that Hero....and when Silver Opens i will make my move...until then i will let AI think it can win :P
 Topjimmies: 1 defense 1 mana farmer/controller, 1 offense?
 tomiesz: i have my guys patrol at different ranges from the base without a given role 
 tomiesz: seems to work so far in bronze 
 AlMualem: i am between that and 2 defenders and 1 sabotager
 Topjimmies: I am going to call it the Disruptor :sunglasses:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, mana farm until mob hp gets to like 18 ... then go berzerk me thinks
 AlMualem: It will be our Frodo/Sam Squad
 Smelty: lol
 Tiramon: yay bronze at last ... took it's time =)
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AlMualem: well done mate
 tomiesz: if i understand correctly there are no divisions in further leagues past wood, and silver opens in like 3 days? 
 Astrobytes: correct
 tomiesz: aight
 tomiesz: time to refactor all of my code then 
 tomiesz: thanks
 Astrobytes: np&#160;:)
 Tiramon: wow default ai has a nasty wind push =)
 Wontonimo: boss or default ai?
 Astrobytes: default
 Tiramon: ok atleast it was my first bot that made it to bronze
 Astrobytes: in bronze
 Wontonimo: oh cool
 Tiramon: now i have to do some stuff in an effective way instead of let all heroes do the same
 Tiramon: and have a look at the spells&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: I'm right beside MSmits in rank :grin:
 Wontonimo: and PatrickMcGinnisII 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm literally standing still, well my heros are
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm seeing the beginnings of some pretty easy stuff to implement tho.  No bronze for me w/o at least MOVE ing
 tomiesz: moving is generally beneficial :D
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621238017">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621238017</a>
 Wontonimo: yup, you are camping
 Topjimmies: I copied the starting positions of the AI boss :upside_down:
 Wontonimo: good call
 Wontonimo: now look at the top players and copy them Topjimmies
 joaolindo: when promotion to bronze occurs?
 Astrobytes: when all your games are finished
 Tiramon: and you are still rated better than the boss
 tomiesz: you can click last battles to see the progress
 joaolindo: Oh, thanks
 joaolindo: this battle in progress percentage are my battles against all other players?
 Tiramon: battles against player around your current rank
 Tiramon: and when you have done 100% you are rated as a stable rank
 Tiramon: and then you can be promoted
 joaolindo: there is a way to downgrade a rank?
 Scarfield: the percentage is how many of the battles you have you have to fight, have finished
 Tiramon: no only promotion
 Tiramon: you won't drop to any lower leages later on
 joaolindo: :ok_hand:
 mnechromancer: Y'all know when Silver opens
 Topjimmies: tomorrow probably
 mnechromancer: Yeah alright
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sunday someone said
 AlMualem: Other say Sunday&#160;:/
 Topjimmies: oh
 Tiramon: League opening: 1650812400000now oyou just have to translate the timestamp because cg forgot it
 Astrobytes: still amusing even after all these hours :D
 Tiramon: click on the league on top of the screen and it shows it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: NinjaDoggy
 Scarfield: LOL xD i just thought NinjaDog was being "helpful"
 Tiramon: [CG]jupoulton you recognized that the leagut opening is a timestamp and not a humanreadable date?
 Tiramon: maybe it helps&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: what? you mean you don't go by timestamps in everyday life? :D
 Topjimmies: find out what type of functions could have returned it and you might be able to figure it out
 Tiramon: most of the time not ... today at work i did&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Tiramon: ok so next is splitting heroes
 AlMualem: GMT: Sunday, 24 April 2022 3:00:00 PM
 Astrobytes: oh damn, codejam round 1B on Sunday too 
 inoryy: not a bad multi this time
 Astrobytes: wooo hello mate
 Astrobytes: it's interesting so far
 Wontonimo: :tada: inoryy&#160;!
 Nerchio: all the legends in the chat :eyes:
 Astrobytes: participating for the weekend? :D
 inoryy: hello!
 inoryy: yeah indeed
 Scarfield: :wave:
 Astrobytes: how's life?
 llllllllll: :ghost: busters 2.0&#160;? :P
 Astrobytes: sort of-ish
 inoryy: all good, mostly busy with work and stuff 
 inoryy: how about you?
 Astrobytes: nice, same old same old here
 Astrobytes: not complaining&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: o7 Heyo all, been a long time since I've done anything but lurk
 Scarfield: Nerchio :taco:
 struct: not a board game what will I do&#160;:'(
 inoryy: :wave:
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox! :tada:
 Scarfield: consider it a board game, with a lot of cells
 Wontonimo: orangesnowfox&#160;! :tada: :wave:  Welcome back
 Astrobytes: and Nerchio :wave: hello!
 orangesnowfox: A *lot* of cells Scarfield
 Scarfield: just 17630 * 9000 of them :p
 inoryy: just a bit off for a bitboard
 Astrobytes: rookie numbers
 orangesnowfox: from what I've read there are a *few* more than that :p
 Wontonimo: quantize X and Y by 10 pixels each and it's just 1763 x 900
 Scarfield: meh, bitboardception, have a bitboard of bitboards, no biggie :p
 orangesnowfox: I mean, you *could* have a  bitboard, it just wouldn't be very efficient, or useful. Since there can be overlapping entities
 emh: I'm using a quantized fog of war map 40x20
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's just pacman who pass gas
 orangesnowfox: I didn't actually do pacman lol
 Astrobytes: nice emh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was kidding, guys do eat alot of bugs
 Nerchio: hello :wave: Astrobytes
 Nerchio: :cake: Scarfield
 ashiknur: how do I know which hero is going to attack which monstar when commanding to move?
 struct: all attack it if they are in range
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Lionking: Pumbaa....nom nom nom
 orangesnowfox: all heroes attack all monsters in range, (as struct said)
 ashiknur:  okay.
 Scarfield: xD Nerchio, while you have been away, Wontonimo made a chat bot, that lets you gift tacos to other users, apparently it didnt work when i tried. But thanks for the cake&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mana gained is dmg dealt, thought it would be only after kill tho
 orangesnowfox: From the statement:&gt; After a hero's move phase, any monsters within 800 units will suffer 2 points of damage. 
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: disabled for contest chat purposes&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: it is disabled during the contest
 Nerchio: luckily
 Scarfield: ah, for the best of course
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :spider:
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: if you could set it to respond "RTFS!!!" for any questions related to info in the statement that would be helpful :D
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: *cough* ceg *cough*
 Wontonimo: yeah, i saw that.  don't really know how to catch most of them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or silver: "opens sunday"
 Scarfield: 90% would be caught if it answers cegs messages :p
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: haha
 Astrobytes: he was at it again earlier
 Scarfield: yea i saw xD
 Astrobytes: lol, classic
 orangesnowfox: sometimes reading comprehension gets worse the more times you read something
 Scarfield: it wouldnt be a contest without it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think i stabilized, time to shutup
 Scarfield: its even worse when not reading it at all&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: true
 Nerchio: well why would I read the rules if I can have astrobytes read it for me
 Scarfield: xD
 Nerchio: :sunglasses:
 Astrobytes: Nerchio: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: i've read the rules but can't see what the strike distance is.  how close does a monster and hero have to be for the hero to strike&#160;?
 Hjax: After a hero's move phase, any monsters within 800 units will suffer 2 points of damage.
 Wontonimo: thanks&#160;!
 orangesnowfox: lmao I just quoted that like 2 minutes ago
 Wontonimo: lol
 Tiramon: Wontonimo
 Scarfield: "After a hero's move phase, any monsters within 800 units will suffer 2 points of damage"
 Tiramon: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28d46d77-4209-4fbc-a270-9d53e5a14fb3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28d46d77-4209-4fbc-a270-9d53e5a14fb3</a>
 Wontonimo: i hange my head in shame
 Astrobytes: Latefield
 Tiramon: hm know he will made a paste
 Tiramon: that are most constants i found/use by now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how often does mob hp go up by .5?
 Scarfield: *chat freeze* obviously ahem
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 llllllllll: 83%, please just let me through :D
 orangesnowfox: plssss
 Astrobytes: where you been hiding orangesnowfox, didn't see you in ages
 Quidome: hm, it is very slow, went shopping got back and still not finished&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: same for me earlier, almost 2 hours to get to bronze lol
 Quidome: Want to have the next ruleset :P
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, serious answer or joke answer?
 Tiramon: ok i get killed by default ais wind ... sad ...
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox: serious I guess?
 orangesnowfox: hospitals and a lack of motivation to do anything.
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox: cool, I feel that
 Astrobytes: nice to have you back regardless
 Quidome: yes! promotion to wood 1 in 26 sec, finally...
 orangesnowfox: aye
 Fallback: is pragma once not working for anybody else?
 Astrobytes: health issues I empathise with, my problem is a *lack* of hospital&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Fallback: why are you using #pragma once?
 Fallback: I have multiple files and I get them condense them into one using a VS extension codingame-merge
 Astrobytes: oh right, offline, thought you meant in the CG IDE :D
 Astrobytes: not sure, I don't use that, does it have any documentation? it might look for traditional include guards
 Astrobytes: or a specific //COMMENT or something
 Tiramon: no idea if they still use that as onsite ide-&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts">https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts</a>
 orangesnowfox: ah, yes, Astrobytes, that would be the other side of the coin
 8swaglord24: anyone know if there are rules against putting my code publicly on github?
 Astrobytes: Yeah: don't
 8swaglord24: okey dokey
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox: life sucks at times eh
 orangesnowfox: ye
 Astrobytes: we killed the chat :tada:
 orangesnowfox: that's rare during compo time
 Astrobytes: indeed it is
 orangesnowfox: I like how my wood2 bot is good enough for bronze lmao, nothing can easily beat the magic strategy of "kill things that will hurt you" so far apparently
 Astrobytes: yeah, nice easy bronze this time around
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and SITSTILL mode isn't good enough... so that works
 orangesnowfox: it also means there's literally no point in doing anything other than datastructures while waiting for bronze lol
 Astrobytes: you could read the referee :D
 orangesnowfox: ah, there's that too
 orangesnowfox: I do have some data structures that need nicening, heh, probably that then ref
 Astrobytes: I won't do anything serious in that regard until tomorrow
 orangesnowfox: wrt ref? or?
 Astrobytes: writing my real bot&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: bc of lack of silver?
 Astrobytes: laziness and sore back
 Astrobytes: in the meantime I can tweak some values from a comfortable position
 orangesnowfox: makes sense
 ganbat24: is there any spendable token i should be aware of?
 Astrobytes: No.
 ganbat24: like limited test runs
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, ide plays are limited
 ganbat24: i can just keep running my code on any of them?
 ganbat24: wait really 
 Astrobytes: also submits
 Astrobytes: there's a cooldown for each, not sure what it's at these days but it's more limited than it used to be
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I thought it was like 5 in 2 minutes...I'm probably wrong tho
 ganbat24: oh thats alot
 orangesnowfox: huh, that's a... *lot* more limited than I thought
 ganbat24: i thought it would be like 1 per hour
 Astrobytes: not when you make small changes it isn't
 orangesnowfox: ^ I make *tons* of changes
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox: they limited it a few contests back iirc
 Astrobytes: and then kept it for regular use too (outside of competition time)
 ganbat24: play my code first then test in arena correct?
 orangesnowfox: yeah, I remember there being a limit put in, just didn't realize it was that harsh.
 Astrobytes: It puts me off spending much time on here these days tbh
 ganbat24: I am just gonna play the template code first
 Hedkleaf: Guys where i can see rules about league changing?
 Wontonimo: beat the boss
 Hedkleaf: i beat the boss 2 hours ago
 cegprakash: lmao default bot is funny
 cegprakash: in bronze league
 cegprakash: lmao
 Hedkleaf: how i can change league?
 ganbat24: you beat boss
 Quidome: beat the boss in the arena that is
 Hjax: you cant just beat the boss, you need to be higher ranked than the boss when your matches finish 
 Wontonimo: ^^
 ganbat24: isnt that same as beating the boss
 Hedkleaf: yes im in top 30 im wood league
 orangesnowfox: ganbat24, not quite
 cegprakash: Hedkleaf wait for 100% completion
 ganbat24: well ill try to beat wood 2 first
 Quidome: and indeed it's super duper slow
 ganbat24: wood 2 then wood 1&#160;?
 IvesL: an hour per promotion
 orangesnowfox: technically, you could lose to the boss but win to every other bot and rank higher that way
 Quidome: yep and then bronze
 ganbat24: has anyone reached silver
 Quidome: not open yet
 orangesnowfox: silver isn't open yet
 Astrobytes: not open yet
 ganbat24: oh
 ganbat24: when does it open?
 Astrobytes:   at 1650812400000
 orangesnowfox: people are really tempting me to write a FAQ for this compo, so that I can just paste it all the time
 Quidome:  :joy:
 Quidome: sunday
 IrakliButu: lmao wtf is this map
 IrakliButu: chat*
 Hedkleaf: last question leagues changed automaticaly or i need find some secret button? :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: seems like referee posted only shows wood1 enabling wind and fog, but weatching leaderboard games, looks like bronze opens them all up
 Th1nhNg0: wow, Im passing wood 1 without doing anything @@
 orangesnowfox: Hedkleaf, automatically
 Th1nhNg0: maybe the bot is too weak?
 Astrobytes: wood league bosses are supposed to be weak
 Th1nhNg0: I didn't use any spell and can beat bronze bot
 orangesnowfox: *shrug* I won't complain about being able to have time to clean up my messes lol
 ganbat24: nobody can see my code right?
 Astrobytes: correct
 IvesL: i guess admin could?
 orangesnowfox: theoretically admin can, yeah.
 FrankR: wrong.. you can see it.. or at least I guess so ð
 Astrobytes: checked for duplicates at contest end yes
 Astrobytes: if users have the same code then one or more are removed from the lb
 orangesnowfox: lmao, my bot is 99% going to be unique just for being in Rust.
 Astrobytes: nah, at the very least d bdr writes in Rust
 PatrickMcGinnisII: watched rust stream on twitch earlier...hmm 48 so far
 PatrickMcGinnisII: VB and F# are rare
 orangesnowfox: lmao so you're telling me to resubmit my bot in VB right before compo ends ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what for achievment in a language
 Astrobytes: VB is disgusting and F# is very niche
 Astrobytes: here at least
 orangesnowfox: nah, that tracks with global sentiment
 Astrobytes: :DMost of the functional peeps go for Haskell here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: better off with CP for ranking
 ganbat24: what are theses half red circles?
 Astrobytes: submission completion?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :nerd: your eyes?
 Astrobytes: Either that or you're hallucinating
 Astrobytes: if you hover over the circles you should see a percentage
 VaseSimion: Does anyone know if the boss will be harder than the AI in bronze now? 
 Topjimmies: 100th down to 500th after I started using spells :joy:
 Astrobytes: VaseSimion: the boss will be chosen from the users in Bronze before silver opens
 llllllllll: it is always harder
 IvesL: that means you are born to be a warrior rather than mages
 VaseSimion: thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: np
 GingerFan301: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/621313946">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/621313946</a>Could someone explain how I lost this? I felt like my units spend more time outside the base than the opponent
 Wontonimo: oh, orangesnowfox you are killing wood 1
 orangesnowfox: nothing beats the magic strat of "kill things that want to kill me" at this stage lol
 Wontonimo: lol&#160;!  what a simple strat&#160;!
 8swaglord24: hey that's my strat too!
 Nerchio: how do i make new units
 orangesnowfox: you don't
 orangesnowfox: afaik
 Astrobytes: this aint SC Nerchio :P
 Nerchio: lame
 Miroslav27: your football team has only 3 players, one in field, one in defense, and one is trying to make some score
 Nerchio: wrong they all follow the closest bug
 PatrickMcGinnisII: GingerFan301 tiebreaker went to mana I think
 Miroslav27: try to push it in direction of opponents base
 einaj: What does the number next to the battle progress circle mean?
 Astrobytes: that's your score
 Astrobytes: calculated via a trueskill-like algo
 GingerFan301: @PatrickMcGinnisll Yes that seems to be the case, my question is how did I lose by around 200 mana?
 struct: anyone else not getting end game screens?
 mnechromancer: yoooo shield and control spells are nuts
 Astrobytes: yes struct
 einaj: oh, I was confused because some people with a lot higher rank had lower scores
 8swaglord24: "Wild mana" is considered mana that you earned outside your base
 Astrobytes: Are there supposed to be any?
 struct: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: " won the game because their heroes gained more mana outside of their base:" GingerFan301
 Astrobytes: well I haven't seen a single one yet
 Don_Nicolas: chavules
 Don_Nicolas: que taaal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: apparently it doesn't matter how much you spent
 Don_Nicolas: wasup

 Slidax: im the best programmer
 orangesnowfox: ayy, bronze promo in 10s
 MaestroDePiton: slidax la xupa
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 juice0: one more time for when the silver league starts please
 Don_Nicolas: no biaches?
 Astrobytes: MODS
 struct: Stop spamming chat
 MaestroDePiton: wakanda foreva
 mnechromancer: have fun with shield and control spells
 ganbat24: aight first naive approach implemented
 ganbat24: aand it does not work
 struct: battles are stuck?
 Astrobytes: don't think so
 Astrobytes: just hideously slow
 struct: yeah you are right
 struct: good thing I havent started yet :p
 Wontonimo: it's amazing how much better my bot does when it is using the correct variables
 Astrobytes: yes you have :D
 Astrobytes: lol Wontonimo
 struct: At least I will learn math for this one
 Nerchio: my bot does better when it doesn't play any games
 Wontonimo: no PID controller needed in this one
 struct: math is still needed though
 orangesnowfox: ... my bot is better than it has any right to be wtheck
 struct: To check if the line the units are heading will hit my base radius
 SashaNukem: is there a vim plugin for this editor?
 ganbat24: i have a function called isThreat that just returns true but its actually detecting?
 Astrobytes: settings on the left, choose vim mode
 Astrobytes: @SashaNukem
 Scarfield: @strobytes
 SashaNukem: Thank you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: Sc@rfield
 Scarfield: finally figured out a few bugs, coome oon submit :p
 Scarfield: mana use doesnt affect wild mana collected right=
 struct: yeah
 Nerchio: struct I think you get input if the monsters are in trajectory to your base or not
 Scarfield: only if they are inside the base, and will target it
 orangesnowfox: (you do, and the way the ref does it is really cute, it just sims movement for 8k turns lol)
 struct: lol
 Nerchio: are you sure Scarfield?
 struct: no
 struct: if its heading towards the radius
 struct: the referee gives it
 orangesnowfox: Scarfield is wrong, sorry bud.
 orangesnowfox: ye
 struct: threatFor
 Scarfield: the needed percentage for a submit to keep going even if going offline is 10% right?
 Nerchio: "threatFor"
 Nerchio: yeah
 Scarfield: nooo
 Nerchio: so don't really need intersection maths at the start at least
 orangesnowfox: That's how I chose which enemy to kill
 Nerchio: maybe for more advanced stuff
 Scarfield: just read the rules&#160;:'(
 orangesnowfox: is that present or past tense? :p
 madninjaskillz: is it correct i cant read my own mana? I can read the enemies but i always get zero for my own?
 IvesL: quite similar to fantastic bits isnt it
 Scarfield: :p
 IvesL: in another way round
 Wontonimo: you've got a bug madninjaskillz
 Scarfield: madninjaskillz you read them in a loop, and probably overwrite your own mana with opponent mana
 madninjaskillz: ive tried directly writing out what i get on the console.readline - the first one always ends with a zero.
 Wontonimo: try using the default code first
 struct: are you sure you are not printing it before reading it?
 madninjaskillz: yup&#160;:( im about to try using a different language to see if it behaves differently
 Nerchio: i mean ok wood2 and 1 are a joke its literally 1 liner
 Wontonimo: thanks for making me feel bad
 Wontonimo: :P
 Nerchio: i remember how difficult ocean of code wood was lol
 orangesnowfox: @nerchio 12 liner for logic because I'm special and use rust
 PatrickMcGinnisII: everyone run from bugs, I need a boost
 orangesnowfox: tell you what, I'll push bugs closer to you :p
 orangesnowfox: that should help you out right /j
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 150 lines for data and structures...and all i still do is move 700 700.    My time will come
 struct: :D
 8swaglord24: anyone know what version Python 3 is?
 Wontonimo: 3
 ManelBC: print(sys.version)
 Astrobytes: 3.9.12
 surgutti: lol, i've submited some greedy heuristic an hour ago and got 8th place
 Astrobytes: See: Languages update in the forum
 Nerchio: my data structures are git clone starter kit
 Nerchio: cause i am lazy
 Astrobytes: surgutti :tada:
 struct: starter kit?
 orangesnowfox: I wish I had made them that generic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think there are kits for javaa and c++
 struct: oh I see them now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not php of course
 struct: Usually they are made by the testers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops PY not C++
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh there is CS
 struct: They asked last time, but I could not code the hex grid with c++
 struct: too much work
 Nerchio: I mean not much is there but still :joy:
 struct: and I would not make a starter using bitboards
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 11 data points for each entity, smh
 surgutti: has anyone tried making a broom from heroes and melting bugs in the middle of the board?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need a compass
 Nerchio: PatrickMcGinnisII premature optimization... you know how it goes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hard to sim enemy with fog
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, they took some AI routes out of the mix
 PatrickMcGinnisII: poor struct
 ganbat24: hahaha my bot lost half of the time because i thought i am always on the top left side
 orangesnowfox: ganbot: the map is mirrored, soooo, you can just reverse everything and continue pretending you're on the top left lol
 ganbat24: yeah i am gonna do that x:=17630-x
 Dr-D: Aaaand I forgot to un-mirror the coordinates for the output =D
 orangesnowfox: ganbat24: don't forget Y
 Nerchio: hmm thats true you can mirror in the fog of war
 ganbat24: hmmm still lost 4
 SabertheLost: woot IÂ´m rank 25 bronze, how is it possible
 8swaglord24: wow gratz!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: drop replay

 SabertheLost: what is wild mana?&#160;:) 
 Topjimmies: earning mana outside of your base
 ganbat24: finally found the bug
 ganbat24: bruh im rank 412 / 415
 ganbat24: oh no nvm
 Thibauld: Managed to get a tie on the the exact same turn as the boss.. who wins then? 
 Nerchio: i think the one who gathered more wild mana but i didnt read the rules
 Thibauld: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d4df67fa-5ac3-4601-9d2e-ec17fdec753b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d4df67fa-5ac3-4601-9d2e-ec17fdec753b</a>
 Nerchio: Scarfield you will soon be in bronze grat
 Nerchio: z
 Nerchio: :tropical_drink:
 Waffle3z: would be interesting to be able to tell where 1st place bots in the past would place in the present if they were submitted again, just to find out how good current bots already are in hindsight
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BOSS 2 failed a WIND: Not enough mana ... :egg::taco::custard:
 Iugi: does the baseX variable work for you?
 Iugi: mine doesnt work somehow
 struct: yes
 Iugi: ok
 yhyoxx: works for me it's either 0 or 17630
 Iugi: the thing is if  I try to use it it always says baseX cannot be resolved to a variable
 Iugi: do you know why?
 orangesnowfox: Just to be clear what I'm reading from ref code: controlling a mob in a direction means it will keep moving that way (if it isn't in range of a base)?
 Astrobytes: afaik yers
 Astrobytes: or yes
 struct: which language lugi?
 Iugi: java
 MichExpatMatt: Is it possible to re-copy your own current code from the arena to the IDE, if you decide you don't like changes you made after submitting code to the arena?
 yhyoxx: make sure the u didnt overwrite the part of the script where the variable is initialized 
 ganbat24: how do i promote i got rank 31 in wood 2
 struct: you can check your submit history MichExpatMatt
 yhyoxx: yes it is possible to get the code you published
 struct: on the left
 Dr-D: @MichExpatMatt there is a History Button on the left&#160;;)
 struct: ganbat24 you must be above the boss after you get all the battles done
 Astrobytes: ganbat24: are you above the boss?
 ganbat24: where is the boss
 Wontonimo: behind you&#160;!
 Dr-D: in wood 1: around place 200
 Wontonimo: or infront
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's about right
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L501-L516">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L501-L516</a> it looks like it will keep going in the same direction ("if new speed&#160;!= 0 setSpeed")
 Astrobytes: click on leaderboard and scroll til you see it
 raxkin: Hey, all rules are in bronze? or in silver there are more rules?
 Wontonimo: in the 'last battles' it is either above you (you are not good enough) or below you (you are great)
 struct: its not possible to know where the new units will spawn is it?
 orangesnowfox: raxkin: all rules are in bronze ye
 ganbat24: yes it is below me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kindaa struct
 Wontonimo: then you just need to wait for all your battles to complete and you will get permoted ganbat24
 orangesnowfox: struct: they spawn symmetrically, so if you know where one spawned you know where the other spawned, plus Java rng is easily crackable lol
 ganbat24: what if i have a better solution do i have to wait for all of em to finish?
 Wontonimo: go ahead an resubmit ... but you'll have to wait again  :O
 Wontonimo: if your current bot will get promoted, I wouldn't resubmit.  the wait could be a long time
 ganbat24: damn its only halfway there
 orangesnowfox: plus you know what turns have a spawn
 Wontonimo: yeah, promoted.  I've been bronzed
 ganbat24: les goo im wood 2 rank 18
 Wontonimo: nice&#160;!
 ganbat24: does it just keeps going up until i promote?
 ganbat24: the rank
 Astrobytes: if you are winning yes
 ganbat24: how long did yall wait?
 orangesnowfox: ~2h from wood 2 to bronze
 Astrobytes: 2 hours to bronze
 struct: orangesnowfox but the number of posssible seeds is too high
 dreadylein: mhh doubt :D
 struct: it used to be 32 bits
 struct: but now its 64 bits
 dreadylein: its 48bits
 dreadylein: or did they change this&#160;?
 struct: I mean the seed they give to the referee
 dreadylein: yeah but java prng only uses 48 of it
 dreadylein:&#160;:)
 struct: ah ok
 struct: still would be too much to reverse :p
 dreadylein: but thats not soomuch the point, the data you get about the spawns slowly leaks the internal state
 Astrobytes: ^ plays too many CTFs :D
 struct: yeah you can reverse it but I dont think its feasible with the time you get
 dreadylein: mh should be, but i dont see enough benefit
 dreadylein: you see a lot of prng calls, slowly leaking the state, the more you get the less work is needed
 Iugi: anyone know why baseX in java doesnt work?
 dreadylein: @lugi what you mean with doesnt work&#160;?
 Iugi: i cant use it 
 Nerchio: works for me
 Nerchio: maybe you changed the way you read input
 Iugi: it says baseX cannot be resolved to a variable
 orangesnowfox: there's still the whole symmetry thing too, you only need to recognize one spawn to find the other one
 Nerchio: lugi you need to declare it I guess?
 Iugi: it is declared by the perwritten program
 ManelBC: prob using it out of scope
 Astrobytes: ^
 dreadylein: good call yeah
 Iugi: out of scope?
 ManelBC: does this help <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21147813/java-variable-scope">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21147813/java-variable-scope</a>

 Zirgons: Where can you read on wild mana?

 NicoI6: On activities &gt; practice?
 orangesnowfox: wild mana is mana collected while not in range of your base
 NicoI6: or learn?

 Astrobytes: Nicol6: Activities-&gt;Practice yes

 Astrobytes: fog isn't the worst atm, may get worse later on, too early for a real opinion
 Iugi: how do i declare baseX to a bigger scope?
 Astrobytes: worse = more significant
 ZarthaxX: mmm
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: just keep your head down and push through man
 ZarthaxX: yeah im curious about what strategies people will come up with
 ZarthaxX: yeah trying, but this next week is hell

 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, for sure, you gotta take some time out mate
 Astrobytes: Otherwise you just get overload
 Topjimmies: this seems buggy, no matter what I do I can't get my guy to cast control
 Astrobytes: That's why you gotta focus on THE most important parts. In short bursts of study remember
 Astrobytes: go hard -&gt; break -&gt; go not so hard -&gt; break -&gt; etc
 Astrobytes: it worked for me at least, you know yourself&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: wow, my bot is really bad in bronze league.  obviously bronze league has a lot more competition than wood2
 struct: do you use spells Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: it's my wood1 bot.  just uses wind
 struct: also dont forget you probably will need wild mana to avoid draws
 struct: ah
 Wontonimo: gotta go.  See ya later
 Astrobytes: later dude
 struct: cya
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes yeah i missed doing the breaks part today and i went all in
 ZarthaxX: bad plan, i should stop trying doing it hehe
 ZarthaxX: wonto D: 
 Astrobytes: exactly ZarthaxX, your poor brain needs a lil time to recover!
 Astrobytes: cramming works to an extent but it's no use in the longer term
 Nerchio: damn already 1200 ppl in bronze
 Topjimmies: ok, something is fucked up, I took out WIND entirely from my code, and it is still casting it :thinking:
 Astrobytes: pebcac
 Topjimmies: When you press play my code, it is supposed to use the code that is currently in the editor right?
 Astrobytes: yep
 Astrobytes: as long as you have your ide code selected in the player slots that is
 Topjimmies: well, I commented out my print("SPELL WIND") and it still uses it
 salamender: Hello, how to print a message above a hero in the spring challenge please&#160;? 
 Lysk: add something at the end of your order "MOVE 10 10 say hello"
 salamender: Thanks&#160;:) 
 Nico_404: Can someone help by idk how to start the code: i have to destroy the mountains before my starship collides with one of them
 Topjimmies: Ah, I didn't know that was an option, thanks. had my arena code selected
 Astrobytes: np&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: easy to mix up at times
 Topjimmies: been spending the past hour tweaking settings for no reason
 Astrobytes: lol, time for a screen break imo :D
 dreadylein: weakness&#160;! :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: me too
 Astrobytes: lol
 dreadylein: just kidding&#160;;) its a good call ^^
 AlMualem: this the moment that i cant think anything more for today and i am just replaying my code to just seek for weaknesses
 orangesnowfox: weakness leaving the bot is weakness leaving the bot.
 Astrobytes: AlMualem: also watch replays of other games that aren't yours
 AlMualem: the butcher has 1M views just from me :P 
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 yhyoxx: where can i watch the butcher&#160;?
 AlMualem: but i am too tired at the moment to implement anything :P i am here since the start ahhaah
 orangesnowfox: replays that aren't yours are basically the best way to ~~steal~~ obtain ideas
 AlMualem: go to leaderboard and you can see the top 10 
 AlMualem: below from each one there is an option "View last battles" ...click that
 Astrobytes: (click on Ful Leaderboard at the top first)
 Astrobytes: *Full
 Astrobytes: Leaderboard-&gt;Full Leaderboard-&gt;View Last Battles
 burnpanck: Hey guys, from reading the source code of the challenge, I conclude that the bottom-right pixel is in fact one less than the value given in the description - can anyone confirm that?
 AlMualem: oh god how much i love dev communities....you wont see this atmosphere anywhere else
 Astrobytes: AlMualem :D
 ganbat24: rank 6 les goo only 5 till promotion
 AlMualem: burnpanck i think that it can be confirm just by hovering in the map at the game...top left isnt 0,0
 AlMualem: confirmed*
 burnpanck: AlMualem not sure I trust the view on this; my source are the `baseWallIntersection` and `snapToGameZone` functions in Referee.java, which do in fact treat 0 as the minimum acceptable coordinate, but WIDTH-1/HEIGHT-1 as the maximum acceptable coordinate
 Astrobytes: yes, 0 to width - 1 sounds about right...
 a-Rye: Nicol6 for that one, you want to pay attention to the index, based on the height value. 
 AlMualem: hm...interesting
 ganbat24: i guesss i dont need to update my code for wood 1?
 struct: yes bottom right is width - 1
 struct: same for height
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/qrbEaIO.png">https://i.imgur.com/qrbEaIO.png</a>
 Astrobytes: it's what you get when you count from 0...
 struct: yeah but the statement might confuse some
 burnpanck: it is - except for  that the description explicitly states that (0/0) is an actual map pixel, as is (17630/9000)
 Astrobytes: ah fair point
 struct: ah now I know why end game didnt show
 struct: it doesnt show if debug is active
 Astrobytes: ohhh
 Astrobytes: yes, good spot
 Astrobytes: it should imo
 struct: yeah
 struct: it does for other games
 Astrobytes: please pass that on if you can
 struct: I posted on forum
 struct: that it only shows if debug is off
 Astrobytes: oh nice one
 Astrobytes: thanks&#160;:)
 dbdr: hm, are you guys sure? I see:
 Loulou6: can someone kindly remind me how to output debug message in c++ in coding game&#160;? 
 struct: well I tried to move a unit there and didnt work
 dbdr: can you go to 0,0?
 struct: yes
 burnpanck:  dbdr: indeed - however, `corners` seems to only be used during the initialisation of the heros, but `snapToGameZone` limits to one less. seems like the hero initialisation is not 100&#160;% fair
 Astrobytes: dbdr: yeah but in the other snapToGameZone method it corrects it to this
 Astrobytes: what burnpanck said&#160;:+1:
 struct: snapToGameZone
 struct: oh
 dbdr: so, it's not symmetrical
 Astrobytes: I think that's the consensus
 dbdr: there are three corners :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 ganbat24: daaaamn butcher2013 is good
 ganbat24: what is the score&#160;?
 aldo._.15: how i make when he takes a curve to slow speed?
 ganbat24: my code is not working on the 2nd boss?
 ganbat24: the inputs are messed up?
 struct: should not happen
 struct: inputs remain the same
 Astrobytes: pebcac
 ganbat24: oh nvm 
 actualCoderTrevor: Wood 1 babieeeeeeee! :muscle_tone2:
 aldo._.15: i won but nothing happens
 aldo._.15: i won t get to next stage
 aldo._.15: nice learning site
 aldo._.15: my robot made the 1s
 aldo._.15: t
 aldo._.15: and nobody is helping me
 elderlybeginner: was boss on wood1 changed a moment ago?It seems to play with different strategy
 actualCoderTrevor: Aldo, what do you mean "You won?" Did you click "Test in Arena"?
 Tuo: So if i control a creature it will continue going in that direction even after the spell is over?
 orangesnowfox: huh, random thing I just thought of: technically intersection code to tell if a mob will attack your base is incorrect because it could skip over the base, with how to ref is written
 ganbat24: what do u mean skip over the base
 orangesnowfox: like if the mob goes out of bounds on the same turn it ends up in the base radius, it won't turn around from out of bounds to attack the base, it'll just... despawn
 orangesnowfox: even if it goes through the inside of the base detection
 ganbat24: i see
 Astrobytes: is damage still applied?
 ganbat24: i just got to btonze without wind lol
 Astrobytes: a lot of us did
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, I'm talking specifically about detection range
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 ganbat24: where is ai on leaderboard
 orangesnowfox: like, from, say, x=5003,y=200 to x=4950, y=-10 (or smth) even though that line goes *through* the base detection range the mob won't detect the base
 orangesnowfox: *if that line doesn't go through the range, please imagine a different line
 Astrobytes: I get you
 Astrobytes: anyway, literally can't sit up much more today, cya'll tomorrow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2nd submit of the day...and I'm out too
 CoolandonRS: How much can the spiders move in a turn in the spring challange?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MOB_MOVE_SPEED = 400
 CoolandonRS: is that constant?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's static, but it doesn't change as far as i know
 CoolandonRS: alright, thanks.
 DollarAkshay: Every turn do the monsters move first or the heroes&#160;?
 CoolandonRS: heros
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like imma promote
 SandmanSW96: what was the name of the last event puzzle&#160;?
 SandmanSW96: before the clash even and this one
 SandmanSW96: event*
 struct: escape?
 SandmanSW96: the cat yeah
 TheRamenMan: cat
 SandmanSW96: thx
 TheRamenMan: cat
 kreska: PatrickMcGinnisll in wood I best players have strong bots i promoted like 30 minutes ago and im top 121 with the same bot from wood 1 and i was like top 8 in wood1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: battle progress is slower now than ever
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just had to move around a bit to pass boss on wood1
 msumera: well, it's enough to write 5 lines of code and  attack the closest monster to the base to get out of wood&#160;:) now with spells the real challenge begins
 iTsluku: how to rankup again? im rank15 in wood2 rn xd 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: be better than the boss
 Tuo: + it takes some time
 kreska: msumera i couldn't get out of wood without wind spell
 iTsluku: ah i just ranked up, guess time was the issue
 msumera: the battles take quite a lot of time
 msumera: maybe i was just lucky then, my bot was quite simple and got out of wood after ~3 hours of battles
 kreska: msumera oh i understand now i did not wait that much long without trying to chenge strategy
 kreska: but i was surprised that the top 10  bots in wood I were strong in my opinion and still werent promoted that fast
 struct: well they need to complete all the battles to get promoted
 struct: there are 411 submits atm
 kreska: i have no idea is this big number or not :D intuition tells me its pretty big compring to 2388 competing right now
 Tanvir: What is default AI?
 DollarAkshay: " even from monsters with no health left." What does this mean&#160;?
 Asterixk: if 2 of your heroes hit a 1 hp spider, you still get 4 mana
 DollarAkshay: ahh okay
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, bronze, gheesh
 Nmurphy: I am looking at some of the games. in lost and almost all of them regardless of if i am winning it just stops and says the other person won. I am pretty new to the website
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bad output will kill u too
 CoolandonRS: does wind not effect people behind you?
 kreska: i think wid affect all monsters and opoonent heros inside the range no matter if they behind
 kreska: wind
 CoolandonRS: Yeah I thought that too but it doesn't look like the case, so wanted to double check
 Thibauld: Can a hero move and cast a spell on the same turn, or does it have to choose one?
 CoolandonRS: one action per hero
 MaroIsLife: Im getting black screen on the spring challenge
 MaroIsLife: Any idea how to fix that?
 elderlybeginner: MaroIsLife&#160;: First - I would check it in another web browser
 MaroIsLife: Already tried that didn't work
 elderlybeginner: When silver league opens?
 mybk: I think: GMT: Sunday 24 April 2022 15:00:00
 mybk: no
 elderlybeginner: Bronze pop-up: "You have unlocked the full game!"
 ZarthaxX: DollarAkshay nope, in general bronze is the end
 Westicles: rank 1604/1651.  dang, must have barely made it
 Waffle3z: wondering how high you can get in bronze using no spells
 orangesnowfox: ~750 right now
 orangesnowfox: I was up at just under 500 earlier
 orangesnowfox: uhh, generally "halfway up bronze"
 orangesnowfox: ... until more people start using spells :p
 msumera: 533 right now without spells
 orangesnowfox: your bot is clearly better than mine :p
 orangesnowfox: tbf I'm still using my wood2 submit
 msumera: i just prepared a bot using spells, i'm about to submit itit's pretty dumb, but let's see how it does&#160;:)
 kreska: im 39 :D
 msumera: nice, my spell bot got 20 wins out of 24 battles and now 260th
 kreska: wow that is nice
 therealbeef: hmm, there's no way to know the opponent's wild mana, right?
 orangesnowfox: you can... Guess? You can know a lower and upper bound
 struct: You kinda can
 struct: but not perfect
 therealbeef: it's quite unusual though to have a game where you don't know if you're going to win or lose even in the last turn
 therealbeef: interesting
 struct: the units that would be within your base radius would also be in the opponent if they have not been killed yet
 therealbeef: by the way, when they say wild mana 'gained', do they mean the total gained, or minus the amount spent?
 struct: ofc this is easy more said than done
 orangesnowfox: total
 therealbeef: thanks
 Thibauld: Initially there was only one scan for the base health and mana, only for your own base. Did the second league add a scan for your enemy's mana? I put myself in the bottom right corner and I'm getting the mana values for my opponent's base..&#160;:/
 orangesnowfox: &gt;  the units that would be within your base radius would also be in the opponent if they have not been killed yet Not quite true, I control mobs that would go... off the map before getting to a base. Those mobs would go to the opponent base but not mine :p
 8swaglord24: @thibauld just noticed this too! really annoying bug
 TheBriar: had the same, added a second scan and now its fine
 struct: ofc orangesnowfox
 struct: I dont do this at all
 Camboui: ooooooooooooooowwwwwww that exlains why I'm tryharding for nothing :D
 struct: I havent started coding yet
 orangesnowfox: ye
 Thibauld: Ah, it was always scanning for both bases, I just never noticed and was always using the wrong values lmao
 struct: Time to start coding&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: ... okay, spamming ctrl should *not* be as effective as it is, I sincerely hope I get hard countered by tomorrow morning lmao
 struct: What are you using ctrl for?
 struct: to send units to opponent base?
 orangesnowfox: yep, I'm just spamming the heck out of it with basically every neutral mob (every mob that will just go off the side of the map) I'm at 522 bronze currently (still submitting), my bot's main problem is not being able to handle defense lol
 struct: I think early game is not worth to send them
 struct: but I might be wrong
 orangesnowfox: probably not, but... tbh I never run out of mana anyway
 struct: you can try this to defend
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621137531">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621137531</a>
 struct: what red player does
 orangesnowfox: huh, that's a strat.
 orangesnowfox: and then red wins on wildmana 
 orangesnowfox: ... Reds strat might be somewhat improvable by using the mobs for massive mana gain to send waves at the opponent. Also, red is counterable via shield
 Wontonimo: hi
 struct: hi Wontonimo
 orangesnowfox: hi
 struct: and also counterable if the opponent pushes and uses wind
 Wontonimo: or shield
 struct: shield seems op
 struct: 12 rounds
 orangesnowfox: Wontonimo shield is what I said at first :p
 Wontonimo: that's pretty funny though.  I'll call him the Air Bender
 Wontonimo: I caught up&#160;!  yeah me!  (oh, sorry orangesnowfox)
 orangesnowfox: that's fine :p
 orangesnowfox: ... Yeah, my strat should not be doing nearly as well as it does lmao, 388 rn
 Wontonimo: Square1001 is 80th.  That's the airbender 
 orangesnowfox: I'm only half through submitting and my rank keeps climbing for no good reason
 pmor: there are a lot of strats no one is using yet
 orangesnowfox: like barrycenters
 pmor: heya Wontonimo
 struct: Can't wait for Daporan to submit on last second with some cheesy strat
 Wontonimo: hey pmor&#160;!  :beer:
 Wontonimo: I like you strat orangesnowfox&#160;!  Send them away
 pmor: been awhile.  haven't had any time to do any challenges.
 struct: the isControlled doesnt change right?
 MeWhenI: MOVE 621 173WIND 8815 4500MOVE 5337 2658
 MeWhenI: could anyone tell me why this output makes me fail?
 struct: after someone casts control it will remain 1?
 pmor: This challenge was done by my company a couple years ago.  Winner did a cheese strat right at the end :P
 Thibauld: SPELL WIND X Y
 orangesnowfox: struct no, it'll go back down to zero after a turn
 MeWhenI: aha, thank you
 struct: oh thanks
 struct: pmor this exact challenge?
 struct: or something similar?
 pmor: exact
 struct: thanks orangesnowfox
 MeWhenI: pmor was it hosted on this site?
 pmor: yeah
 MeWhenI: oh huh
 MeWhenI: i didnt know they reused these
 struct: neither did I
 pmor: I guess we were the guinea pigs
 MeWhenI: wonder if anyone at ur company saved their sol
 pmor: its a fun challenge.  The best bots were heuristics
 struct: also might be easier to implement cheesy strats
 pmor: fun to do some bastard strats to the enemy players
 struct: with lower ammount of players
 mybk: genetic algorithm is a bad idea for this challenge&#160;? 
 pmor: That's what I tried, I didn't do very well
 pmor: The imperfect information hurts it
 mybk: emm how many episodes you simulate
 pmor: Don't remember. It was a couple years ago
 Thibauld: In order to get wild mana, does the hero or the spider need to be in the green zone?
 Wontonimo: hero at least 5000 from base
 pmor: They need to be outside of your base perimeter
 struct: The hero or the spider?
 orangesnowfox: just the hero, thanks for making me look that up lmao
 struct: are you 100% sure?
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L563">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L563</a>
 struct: thanks
 Thibauld: Thanks!
 orangesnowfox: Wontonimo got it right before I even knew there was something to get right
 Wontonimo: yeah, i broke into the top 300 
 struct: grats
 pmor: grats
 orangesnowfox: grats!
 Wontonimo: I did end up using a bit of PID :grin:
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621585386">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621585386</a> apparently there are multiple ways of doing the airbender strat
 Wontonimo: instead of targeting the bugs x,y , I take into account 1 round of vx,vy
 orangesnowfox: I tried that and it made my bot worse lmao
 orangesnowfox: maybe it would be better on a submit, buuut, I'm not comfy making an entire submit for that yet, not until I'm sure I do it right.
 Wontonimo: anyone benching locally?
 orangesnowfox: I don't have the patience to get everything working on my super cranky linux distro lol
 Lysk: can't get the jar to behave&#160;:(
 struct: nope
 orangesnowfox: Also like no point in benching against myself currently, I have like, 4 bots
 struct: and too early for that I think
 SashaNukem: is there a way to add colors to std:cerr &lt;&lt; "test[OK]" &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: no 
 struct: only locally
 struct: on ide its not possible
 SashaNukem: @struct thank you&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: @struct yee, basically my point 
 orangesnowfox: ... adding in defensive controls helps things
 orangesnowfox: I *still* haven't touched wind or shield lol
 Wontonimo: my rank improved quite a bit once I adjusted my default guard positions to be just outside my base.  Collecting wild mana sure made a difference.  Gotta give a +1 for adding that game mechanic
 Wontonimo: it game incentive to get units out onto the field and not just camp
 Wontonimo: *gave
 yhyoxx: hello, if i use brutaltester for testing, what is my bot playing against&#160;? 
 Wontonimo: you need to feed it 2 bots
 orangesnowfox: other versions of your bot, bots you find on the internet, etc
 orangesnowfox: (ps: don't share bots)
 Wontonimo: if you have some hyperparameters you want to tune, it could help
 yhyoxx: okay got it thanks 
 yhyoxx: what do you mean hyperparameters 
 yhyoxx: u mean something like a const coordinate
 yhyoxx: and ill test against myself with all possible coordinates until i find the optimal one&#160;?
 therealbeef: control seems persistent, but that's not what the spell description implies though
 struct: I thought it was only 1 turn at first
 therealbeef: me too
 orangesnowfox: control affects mobs permanently unless they're in range of a base, but technically they're only controlled for 1 turn
 orangesnowfox: control only affects heroes for a turn, certainly
 Wontonimo: hyperparameters are constants in your code that you've just found through experimentation.  Like what distance to camp from your base
 orangesnowfox: or like the minimum health you'll "let" be used to control a mob into the opponents base
 struct: to calculate wild mana I can just check current_mana - previous_mana - (2 * heroes_inside);
 struct: right?
 struct: Just need to be carefull of spells
 orangesnowfox: no... heroes will attack all mobs in range
 Wontonimo: you can just keep track of your spells
 struct: orange but doesnt matter if the mob is inside
 struct: it still gives wild mana
 struct: it only matters if the here is outside or not
 struct: hero*
 orangesnowfox: right, but you could attack two mobs lol
 struct: ah
 orangesnowfox: Also, spells don't matter for damage
 orangesnowfox: wind happens after hero movement and attacking
 orangesnowfox: no other spell takes affect in the same turn
 orangesnowfox: even mob moving happens after...
 orangesnowfox: The way I'd calculate it tbh is "mobs in prev turn compared to heroes as of this turn"
 orangesnowfox: which... *still* isn't perfectly accurate
 struct: I love games without perfect information
 orangesnowfox: right?
 struct: totally
 ClockSort: there sure isn't perfect information in the PDF :P
 orangesnowfox: ocean of code *was* a lot of fun tho
 Wontonimo: new submit, new ideas
 ClockSort: how can I learn more about brutaltester?
 orangesnowfox: ~~new submit more hyperparameters~~
 pmor: battle progression going slow for anyone else?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 orangesnowfox: pmor its always like that in compos
 ClockSort: thanks wonton in your opinion
 pmor:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: yeah, kinda slow
 orangesnowfox: especially- on the first day- whenever a new league opens- on the last day
 Wontonimo: hey ClockSort, use this command
 Wontonimo: in the above example you have 2 bots, one in node and one in python
 ClockSort: can you see "wild mana" onscreen during a simulation?
 Wontonimo: no
 ClockSort: do you think wild mana matters in a game between skilled bots?
 struct: This feature should be added
 orangesnowfox: oh data you cheeky little <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621593821">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621593821</a>
 Wontonimo: It does for me.  Makes a huge difference
 orangesnowfox: strat in a nutshell "yeet the mob into opponent base"
 ClockSort: if you spend wild mana, does it still count toward your tiebreak total?
 struct: yes
 struct: you cant spend it
 orangesnowfox: it's more a... score
 Lysk: how did you get spring2022.jar Wontonimo?
 orangesnowfox: "compile it from the ref"
 Wontonimo: the code is published.  The link is on the left hand side.  you have to compile it yoruself
 Lysk: you have no issues with GameRunner?
 Wontonimo: I'm on your orange tail snowfox&#160;!
 Wontonimo: oh :sad: I got bumped down
 orangesnowfox: did you lose to DataWasTaken?
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: lost to strykrj <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621594956">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621594956</a>
 Wontonimo: only 3 lost games out of 21 so far
 orangesnowfox: same lol
 orangesnowfox: first loss was to rtimbull
 Wontonimo: all three are from wild mana 
 orangesnowfox: not same lol
 orangesnowfox: cuz my defense is worse than yours
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621596435">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621596435</a>
 orangesnowfox: lmao I just saw you in my feed&#160;%-%
 Wontonimo: you got me&#160;!
 orangesnowfox: yee
 orangesnowfox: same result as a random IDE play I did btw lol
 Wontonimo: My wild mana game needs improvement
 orangesnowfox: I beat astrobytes too apparently
 orangesnowfox: (wildmana)
 Wontonimo: my previous run got to 192nd but with slightly different code
 KelvinAndHubbles: How do yall eval whether a bot is ready for arena? I usually do a bo5 between my current and my new one, but that seems wack sometimes
 orangesnowfox: Kelvin I submit and if its worse I revert in an hour lol
 struct: i test it locally
 struct: vs multiple versions
 struct: and 100+ games
 orangesnowfox: Too much work lolol
 Wontonimo: oh, you got the bench going struct&#160;!  nice
 struct: nah
 struct: this is what I do on other multis
 orangesnowfox: Too early for bench, too much room for improvement in major ways that aren't useful to do involve hyperparameter tuning 
 Wontonimo: unless the hyper parameters are 14,000 NN weights :smirk: 
 orangesnowfox: true
 orangesnowfox: I have a rockpaperscissors going on, I lose to super agro (throw an agent in your base) strats, and I win against defensive (to wildmana) and I have a have a tossup against moderate strats 
 pmor: think some NN bots are going to show up?
 Wontonimo: without a doubt
 thomasgonda3: hey is there a way to fight against a specific other player with your bot
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: bottom center, delete the boss
 thomasgonda3: oh tight thanks
 Wontonimo: then click the empty space where the boss was
 orangesnowfox: well, now, that's a strat <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587</a>
 Wontonimo: has to be the same league or lower league with the same rules
 pmor: ha! that's the first of the yeet other player strat.  That was a common strat in my company comp
 Wontonimo: you got blown away orangesnowfox
 orangesnowfox: I think if I see an opponent hero I'm going to just control them towards a non-base corner until I can't see them anymore
 orangesnowfox: I basically never see opponent heroes unless they're trying to pull agro stuff... Actually, here's a wild idea, what if I just kept controlling their bot forever in my base, they do get mana... But they don't get wildmana, and they basically lose a hero forever (I can technically use a different hero every time)
 orangesnowfox: plus that hero has to help defend *my* base lol
 dmolitor: how do I add Debug to the screen? for example display Debug Messages above heros in the Debug Overlay?
 pmor: works until they bubble themselves
 orangesnowfox: bubble?
 pmor: shield
 orangesnowfox: ah, right...
 orangesnowfox: Wait, duh, that's the obvious answer, just shield myself.
 orangesnowfox: that's... Probably a lot easier
 orangesnowfox: my bot is apparently ~rank200 good
 Thibauld: omg that's genius, just kidnap an enemy hero.. *starts coding*
 ClockSort: but control takes 10 mana and lasts only one turn , how would you keep the control orangesnowfox?
 struct: it doesnt last 1 turn
 struct: it keeps going to the target
 struct: just worded poorly
 JulienKerlero: LMAO the Bronze Boss just camps my base and winds monsters into my base lol
 ClockSort: even when controlling enemy hero?
 struct: ah for enemy hero might be only 1 turn
 struct: Im not even sure if it works or not
 KelvinAndHubbles: feel like wind is just more effective at that point, further distance is it not?
 KelvinAndHubbles: 2200 units vs 800
 Wontonimo: you look a little rusty there orangesnowfox
 Wontonimo: when did you learn rust, and do you have any suggestions of starting places?
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: how to kidnap an enemy hero?
 orangesnowfox: Uhh, 2017-2018, and.... I have no clue, everything is so different now.
 Westicles: nice, I'm first both for my school, company, and country
 MeWhenI: is there any reason to use wind rather than control as a defense spell? it seems strictly better to send the monster to your enemy
 orangesnowfox: cuz you can wind 15 mobs at once
 MeWhenI: oh yeah aoe
 Annona: hoang sa truong sa la cua Viet Nam 
 Annona: thay Huan mai chat 
 KelvinAndHubbles: plus problem with control the spider significantly before it can get away from you, almost better to just take the mana and not just give enemy free mana at that point
 Ariyogi: Hello
 KelvinAndHubbles: the spider is significantly damaged*
 Eltrion: Wind just seems strictly better than control in 95% of situations
 KelvinAndHubbles: eh, control basically can turn it towards enemy base permanantly
 orangesnowfox: Kelvin... Huh? I... typically don't damage the mob before controlling it
 orangesnowfox: and that too
 orangesnowfox: I'm at 220 and I don't use wind at all lol
 Eltrion: And then he blows out his base with wind, groups up the mobs, and his jungler farms them all for wild mana
 Eltrion: Im at 100 and use nothing but wind
 orangesnowfox: true, but consider, I can defeat ur wind with control :p
 Eltrion: How?
 orangesnowfox: Uhh, control your hero 
 Eltrion: Wind pushes farther and more at once.
 KelvinAndHubbles: didn't realize control has a way bigger radius you can cast it from
 orangesnowfox: ye, but control has a further effect radius
 orangesnowfox: like, I can out range your wind with control
 Eltrion: Ehh, maybe, but i'd have to be a conjunction strat, and only like the top 20 guys are doing that yet.
 orangesnowfox: conjunction meaning?
 Eltrion: All the control strats I've fought basicallty end like I said with my jungler harvesting all the mobs sent to me for wild mana.
 orangesnowfox: ye, and I mean, that's a good strat, not gonna lie, you beat my current bot
 Eltrion: Complex spell casting decisions using both wind and control
 orangesnowfox: ah
 MeWhenI: ripp every win im getting is to a wild mana tiebreaker
 Eltrion: Wind is just way easier to use effectively and make decisions about.
 MeWhenI: not sure how to farm it while keeping up a good defense
 Eltrion: Also You can Stack wind.
 orangesnowfox: yeah, for sure wind is good, I'm just saying these strats do have counters :p
 Eltrion: Give one of your guys jungler code, the other two should spread out take the left and right so your defensive position is further out from your base.
 ClockSort: in move 43 here, does the wind only hit the opponent's hero because other entities are too far away? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621600146">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621600146</a>
 orangesnowfox: nah, it's because the hero is within range
 pmor: looks like hero is in range, bug is not.
 Waffle3z: does the distance from a monster to the base have to be &lt;5000 or &lt;=5000 for it to turn?
 Waffle3z: "within" probably means inclusive
 rwilson: @Waffle3z , it's using &lt;= see here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/fbb4d12a07aa632b632d748d6c9a78a2b25e50ea/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L75">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/fbb4d12a07aa632b632d748d6c9a78a2b25e50ea/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L75</a>
 orangesnowfox: ye <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L533">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L533</a> leads to that after a couple clicks
 pmor: Huh, my wood2 bot made it to bronze
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 pmor: was implementing wind when I got pinged for promotion :D
 Wontonimo: congrats.  i spent way too long in wood 2
 orangesnowfox: pmor my first bot made it to bronze, which was basically "attack whatever wants to hurt my base"
 orangesnowfox: KISS is amazing sometimes
 pmor: Yeah, that's basically what I did.  Created another list of monsters where threatFor is 1 and sorted it on distance to base
 pmor: then just had my heros go to town
 orangesnowfox: yep, literally that, just... instead of creating another list, I did it in an iterator
 orangesnowfox: and then did `minBy` (well, `min_by_key`) the distance to the base ^2 because there's no need to do a sqrt
 Eltrion: Yeah, wood 1 boss wasn't much harder than wood 2
 Westicles: I wonder if in the end people will be in legend without a sim?
 Eltrion: My first bot made it all the way through, basically the same. Find what's closest to the base, send all three guys there to hit it
 Waffle3z: how rare is that?
 struct: what Waffle3z?
 Waffle3z: reaching legend without a sim
 ZarthaxX: depends on contest
 ZarthaxX: i remember meanmax oh boi, just 1 guy without sim right?
 struct: also depends on what sim is
 struct: I doubt many will have full sim
 ZarthaxX: with fog of war its kind of weird, isnt it?
 struct: yeah
 ZarthaxX: unpredictable spwans too
 orangesnowfox: some hidden information games let you do a sim
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: up to certain point yes
 orangesnowfox: this one... Does not really
 ZarthaxX: this one feels like codebusters
 JohnCM: i think i'm going to go an offensive strategy that involves mind controlling all units to the opponent's base, and shielding them
 ZarthaxX: mah man john
 orangesnowfox: ZarthaxX I was thinking OoC
 JohnCM: i wish we could stun heroes, it would be much easier
 JohnCM: stun, slow, kill
 ZarthaxX: orangesnowfox that one had an interesting submarine tracking
 orangesnowfox: yeah
 orangesnowfox: JohnCM what if I told you... You could
 JohnCM: how to stun heroes?
 orangesnowfox: Control&#160;;)
 JohnCM: you can control heroes?
 orangesnowfox: yep!
 struct: you can  use any spell on them
 JohnCM: that's interesting... i can control them away from their base
 actualCoderTrevor: For like two seconds
 struct: 1 turn
 JohnCM: oh can you push heroes too with wind
 ClockSort: hi JohnCM, good to see you again&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: struct, you can stunlock them if you sacrifice one of your heroes to control them every turn
 Basilisk1: 1337
 JohnCM: hello clocksort
 ClockSort: so Control changes the direction of mobs, but only affects enemy heroes for one turn.
 pmor: JohnCM - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587</a>
 struct: cant they shield themsef?
 struct: self*
 JohnCM: i just finished streaming my spring challenge.. haha now bronze league
 JohnCM: i will stream again in 2 days or so when silver appears
 orangesnowfox: struct I don't think so? If you're controlled I don't think you can do anything but move, lemme double check
 JulienKerlero: Silver league isnt up yet&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Not until Sunday
 JulienKerlero: Who's first atm&#160;?
 struct: well you are controlled but next turn you might be able to shield before they control
 struct: but control seems to come before shield
 struct: So I dont know
 orangesnowfox: ah, if you shield on the same turn they control for the first time ye
 JohnCM: haha looks like meta will be shielding all 3 heroes
 orangesnowfox: JohnCM tbh I've been thinking about it
 orangesnowfox: But here's a fun one
 JohnCM: wow i can literally wind all heroes away from their base
 KelvinAndHubbles: Weird there's only two corners being used and lot of spiders go off map, higher leagues 4 player maybe?
 orangesnowfox: You have to have a 1 turn gap between shields
 JohnCM: i'm an avenger, not a defender
 struct: no KelvinAndHubbles
 struct: these are final rules
 JohnCM: i will whack the opponents before they have time to say 'what'
 orangesnowfox: JohnCM sorry to say that I'm already aware of this strat <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587</a>
 JohnCM: haha ok that's fun
 JulienKerlero: If Im let's say 1000th in Bronze League, am I 1000th of all players&#160;?
 JohnCM: time to do some massive creature spam hero wind damage
 orangesnowfox: JulienKerlero yep
 JulienKerlero: Alright that's nice then
 ItsNotABug: That replay stressed me out

 orangesnowfox: turn0: you get controlled, you do something, say, `wind`, it goes throughturn1: you get controlled *again*, you're forced to `moveturn2+ same until either you stop getting juggled or another one of your heroes helps out
 struct: So my only chance is to shield when you control the first time
 struct: right?
 JulienKerlero: Will we have more spell in silver, gold etc&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: JulienKerlero no, bronze is the max everything
 orangesnowfox: struct: unless you use another hero to bail the first hero out, yep
 JulienKerlero: alright
 orangesnowfox: JohnCM here's another fun one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621593821">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621593821</a>
 ClockSort: if you're crontrolled on turn 0, you don't know about it until turn 1, during which time your hero can do nothing, right?
 struct: yeah
 ClockSort: so if you get controlled again, there is no escape unless another hero helps or enemy runs out of mana
 orangesnowfox: yep. But if you cast shield on or before turn 0 you're fine
 orangesnowfox: ... until the shield runs out
 struct: you can even use the opponent to defend your base
 struct: :D
 ClockSort: turn 0 shield. then turn 1 you still take the forced action? 
 rwilson: on the plus side for the defender - the enemy isn't getting to move while doing that control lock.
 rwilson:&#160;;) controlling enemy to go to your base is less effective than it sounds&#160;;) 
 struct: yeah because he will still get points 
 struct:&#160;:/
 orangesnowfox: ClockSort, yep, but only one
 rwilson: pretty easy to control lock enemy in their base - but hard to pull them to yours --  eats up so much mana cause they like to run away 
 struct: yeah better use on them
 struct: on their*
 rwilson:&#160;:( but then your hero is in their base helping them defend  :( 
 struct: but you get wild mana
 orangesnowfox: yeah, but you get score
 orangesnowfox: honestly, it's more useful to use it to break a wind chain
 rwilson: @struct - oh good piont... gotta try that ...  adjust to EDGE of base, not IN base&#160;;) 
 orangesnowfox: like, as a counter to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621137531">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621137531</a>
 struct: you dont need to be in the edge of the base
 struct: because its the opponent one
 orangesnowfox: or to prevent <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621598587</a>
 orangesnowfox: I don't really think controlling opponent heroes is a viable longer term thing atm
 orangesnowfox: it's more something you do to mess with their plans
 rwilson: ahh , yeah i see you're point struct ...  still might try edge....      just targeting their base corner ended up being real bad tradeoff ...    started losing all my easy wins ... 
 Enknable: is there a non-heuristic approach?
 VizGhar: Enknable yes there for sure is&#160;:)
 MeWhenI: advanced strategy: teach your heroes the Ancient Language of the Gods
 MeWhenI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621613284">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621613284</a>
 VizGhar: you can always create decision tree. Where is a tree there is search algo
 Enknable: true. decision trees are not great for those close monsters coming out of nowhere
 orangesnowfox: MeWhenI: assert skill by flexing with ancient language
 Enknable: so you could predict long term middle action
 Ariyogi: Hello i am Predator from heaven
 JulienKerlero: What's the score next to the rank&#160;?
 JulienKerlero: like 34.18 or 21.69
 rwilson: isn't that essentially just your win-percentage&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: nah, it's closer to ELO (I forget what the exact algorith, is)
 ZarthaxX: true skill
 orangesnowfox: that
 orangesnowfox: anyway, the answer is "whatever the boss has + 0.01"
 ZarthaxX: hehe 
 orangesnowfox: and there's no boss currently, because silver doesn't start until Sunday
 JulienKerlero: Yeay I made it to top200&#160;!
 rwilson: nice @JulienKerlero, congrats.
 rwilson: anyone bothering with Voronoi partitions at all?  or just calculating times to intercept &amp; sorting?
 orangesnowfox: I'm not sure Voronoi gets anything useful here
 MeWhenI: just targetting closest to the base and it seems to be working
 MeWhenI: decently
 rwilson: thinking of it because of 2 hereos target same creep - but 1st can intercept &amp; kill prior to 2nd getting there...     
 orangesnowfox: for wood to get into bronze ye
 orangesnowfox: ah
 orangesnowfox: I don't do anything related to that yet lol
 MeWhenI: big brain stuff
 rwilson: i feel like the simpler version is working good enough for others --   look like they just assign attackers ( i.e. only 1 hero allowed to target a given creep ) 
 orangesnowfox: two heroes targetting the same creep can mean killing it faster in a lot of cases (but I can think of some where like, only one hero attacking would be better)
 orangesnowfox: ayy Wontonimo you beat me <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621615403">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621615403</a>
 rwilson:&#160;;) @orangesnowfox - it's coming up for me a lot in the tiebreak cases ...  i'd be able to harvest more creeps if some hereos spent less time walking towards creeps that will easily die without their help.
 pmor: you were hardly using any spells
 orangesnowfox: who?
 pmor: you, in that replay
 pmor: you had a ton of mana and lost where you could have diverted and pushed the bugs out of your base
 orangesnowfox: well consider, I don't have wind implemented lol
 pmor: lol, that would it
 JulienKerlero: lmao i fought your IA orangesnowfox and you mind controlled every unit into my base
 orangesnowfox: yep!

 Nghia64582: shortest mode is stupid idea
 Nghia64582: c++,java alway lose
 Nghia64582: javascript takes all
 TyLuu: also python
 code_maniac: Ruby as well
 RehatbirSingh: hi
 jacek: good morning
 Tim_McSim: Hello!&#160;:)
 JulisTaf: Hi&#160;! :wink:
 swiftpipe: javascript 
 DieuMQ: hello
 Acerbic: "shortest mode" needs a World Best with Your Language score on the results board. So if you are using some exotic lang, you can still see how well you did.
 Acerbic: Stupid site, why is it asking me to prove I am not a robot AFTER EVERY match?!
 LelouchVC2: it stops asking after a while
 Acerbic: its like the 3rd time in a row.&#160;:( 
 LelouchVC2: after a long while
 Acerbic: i am not hopping IPs or anything fishy...
 jacek: youre clash addict
 Acerbic: its not an addiction, I can stop at any time.&#160;:-P
 CodeMonster0214: ok
 Zerp: anyone know how to sort a list using a matrix in c#?
 Zerp: i have a list of factories neutral/enemy factories and i have a given factory, that's mine. I want to sort the list by the distances from enemy/neutral factory to my factory using a distance matrix
 WINWINWIN: have a get_distance method which takes two factories and returns the distance from the matrix between them
 WINWINWIN: and use a quick sort just change a[i]]&gt;a[i] to dist(a[i], req) &gt; dist(a[j], req)
 WINWINWIN: Also @JBM time is running out... take trolls vs castles out of WIP for approvval?
 JBM: Time is no issue
 WINWINWIN: But if enough people dont see it during the approval phasse what happens?
 Zerp: wait doesnt c# have quickSort built in where i just have to supply the function?
 JBM: Huh?
 WINWINWIN: Code the quick sort on your own&#160;:/
 struct: dont do that
 struct: C# has sort ofc
 Zerp: so List.Sort(dist(a[i], req) &gt; dist(a[j], req)
 Zerp: am i the only that doesnt like/ find it hard to understand microsoft's documentation?
 Zerp: like all the code examples are &gt; 150 lines
 Uljahn: you should really spend some time on the basics&#160;:/
 Zerp: i mean this is their example of how to use List.Sort() <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/ukawiqebob.c#">https://hastebin.com/ukawiqebob.c#</a>
 Zerp: almost 200 lines
 Uljahn: just search stackoverflow.com then
 tomatoes: this example not just sort, but "sortable" objects
 dbdr: Acerbic: try the golf puzzles
 dbdr: JBM is playing the long game
 dbdr: Troll vs Castles 2037
 HauTran: really
 jaheerkalanthar: hello python
 Zerp: would this work as comparison function so List.Sort(thisFunction)
 Zerp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/eqalapapax.cpp">https://hastebin.com/eqalapapax.cpp</a>
 Uljahn: best way to figure out is to try it yourself
 Uljahn: this chat is not meant for spoon-feeding i guess&#160;:/
 tomatoes: maybe you want .OrderBy?
 Uljahn: literally the first answer for "csharp sort" on SO
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: pls teach me senpai
 Automaton2000: i think it's a bug
 struct: I might have a bit of free time to port chess
 Uljahn: ^
 struct: But not sure if I should or not
 struct: I have mixed feelings on it
 tomatoes: some weird modification maybe
 struct: some people asked for 960
 struct: Starting positions are randomized
 struct: 960 stands for the number of starting positions
 tomatoes: hm, i don't like this thing in tron. but don't know
 Zerp: what if your compare function needs more parameters than x and y?
 Zerp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.comparison-1?view=netcore-3.1">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.comparison-1?view=netcore-3.1</a>
 tomatoes: they're mirrored, should be fine :thinking:
 Zerp: in this example they only use x and y and when calling the function doesnt even pass the parameters?
 Zerp: CompareDinosByLength(string x, string y)
 Zerp: the call dinosaurs.Sort(CompareDinosByLength);
 RoboStac: yes, it passes that function to sort so sort can call that function with any x / y pair inside dinosaurs
 Zerp: can i pass more paramets into the comparison function like this
 Zerp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/eqalapapax.cpp">https://hastebin.com/eqalapapax.cpp</a>
 RoboStac: no, it can only take a function for comparing two elements that are in the structure
 Zerp: is there another way to achieve the same effect of that function?
 Zerp: i want to a sort a list of vertices id's depending on teir distances to a source, which is stored inside an adjacency matrix
 RoboStac: the easy way is to just make dist global
 RoboStac: otherwise you can probably do some sort of closure that capture s dist but I don't know enough about c# to say how to do that 
 tutubalin: CoC stories. Shortest mode. Trivial problem to convert hex to dec.Made 22 chars solution in Python3 just to find out that other people have already submitted it.
 jacek: cool story bro
 tutubalin: Urgent mode on: learn Ruby in 15 minutes.
 jaheerkalanthar: :innocent::rage:
 jaheerkalanthar: Hey guys im new to coding world but i love lot to code in my own way :heart_eyes:
 Undaare: Hey guys if you first place in CoC please share your code! Thanks
 Undaare: Hey guys if you first place in CoC pit would be very nice if you share your code! Thanks
 tutubalin: i always share, even if i am on 2nd place )
 Zerp: Hey guys if you're last place in CoC please DON'T share your code! Thanks
 Zerp: :joy:
 Zerp: in gitc, can a distance between two factories be 1.5? or 0.5?
 tutubalin:&#160;:)
 Zerp: sometimes when i hover over troops in debug mode it says ETA = 0 or sometimes 0.5
 tutubalin: that awkward moment when you lose CoC because you didn't notices it's Fastest Mode and spend 10 minutes codegolfing
 jrke: thats your misunderstanding tutubalin&#160;;)
 tutubalin: jrke that was another clash. you won fairly
 jrke:&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Joining the code forces contest now?
 jrke: im doint halite on kaggle so can;t join codeforces
 tanmaycodernovice: their IDE doesn't work with this?
 tanmaycodernovice:  'dict_items' object is not reversible
 tanmaycodernovice: its working fine in my ide 
 tanmaycodernovice: print(' '.join(str(v) for k,v in reversed(d.items())))
 RoboStac: yeah, thats a python 3.8 feature and cg are on 3.7

 uvBoss: hello
 uvBoss: anyone on who did the breakthrough?
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough</a>
 uvBoss: or someone who knows bou minimax??
 uvBoss: bout*
 uvBoss: no one??: sob:
 uvBoss: :sob:
 uvBoss: i just need some idea on the heuristics btw
 tanmaycodernovice: @DiL need help bro
 tanmaycodernovice: DM 
 twitlydoof: does codingclash has some bots?
 Uljahn: ye
 Hjax: uvBoss whats your question? 
 tanmaycodernovice: @_sensei_ please sahre ur code 
 tanmaycodernovice: share*
 uvBoss: @Hjax hello
 uvBoss: cna u share some idea bout the heuristics in case no one wins?
 uvBoss: and my minimax also cant go more than 3 steps deep
 uvBoss: any ideas?
 uvBoss: thanku for responding
 pardouin: I think you should be able to re-submit in CoC if no one submitted in the meanwhile
 pardouin: when you submit very fast in fast mode cause it's easy and you didnt have time to check tests and you discover a subtlety afterward it's...&#160;:/
 Hjax: uvBoss what game are you playing? 
 uvBoss: breakthrough
 pardouin: like you use floor instead of round 
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough</a>
 Hjax: ah, well intuitively having more pieces is better than having less pieces 
 uvBoss: yeah i have that
 Hjax: having pieces farther along on the board is probably good 
 WillTheBill: Then you will get judgement from the system tests and be able to change your code based on that Pardouin
 uvBoss: that too
 uvBoss: xD
 Hjax: many minimax searchers reward mobility, which is the number of legal moves 
 pardouin: sure will that's the point
 uvBoss: explain
 Hjax: uvBoss you give a bonus to having more legal moves, because if you have more legal moves than your opponent, you have more options to potentially outplay them 
 uvBoss: ohh
 uvBoss: noice
 uvBoss: ty
 uvBoss: i m trying this one
 uvBoss: anything else?
 Hjax: i havent tried breakthrough, so i can only give general suggestions 
 uvBoss: oh oke np
 pardouin: when you're in top 100 it's extremely long to imprve your rank so getting 8th for a small mistake 
 uvBoss: ty again
 pardouin: you lose 20 places for nothing
 WillTheBill: but it is part of the game to be able to validate the correctness of ones program
 WillTheBill: based on the sample data
 pardouin: in fast mode it's fast reading
 pardouin: when a subtlety is hidden in the last example and was mentionned nowhere in the wording...
 pardouin: ofc you can check all tests everytime but then you take the risk of finishing 2nd and you can lose ranks
 WillTheBill: I always check every test, but given the problem description one should be able to write a correct program without any test data
 uvBoss: @hjax any ideas on move ordering??
 pardouin: if it's a medium problem where people will take 2-3min to write a code, you can afford losing 2 sec to check tests, but when the pb is very easy and takes 25 sec, losing 2 sec not cool
 Hjax: uvBoss captures first, history heuristic 
 uvBoss: i do have capture first
 uvBoss: but i dont understand the history heuristics?
 pardouin: I know will but the problem is not always fully stated in the intro, sometimes you discover stuff afterward
 uvBoss: memoization?
 Hjax: whenever a move causes a cutoff at a given depth, you increment a counter for that move at that depth 
 Hjax: and then you order moves that have higher values in that table first 
 uvBoss: cutoff?? im dumb xD
 Hjax: are you doing alphabeta? 
 uvBoss: ya
 Hjax: so you know how you can quit early, if you exceed the bounds 
 Hjax: and not look at all the moves
 uvBoss: ahh
 uvBoss: yea
 WillTheBill: it should be fully stated tho. If a test case is not within the possibilities of the general problem description, then the problem should not have been validated by moderators
 Hjax: thats called a cutoff
 uvBoss: i think i get it
 uvBoss: noice
 uvBoss: ty
 Hjax: if you google history heuristic theres some good articles about it 
 uvBoss: oke let me see
 WillTheBill: But i totally get your frustration. Sometimes the problems are not very well stated.
 pardouin: I think i'll always wait 100% tests in the future to avoid that
 pardouin: but it will be frustrating ^^
 WillTheBill: Yea&#160;:)
 uvBoss: and any ideas for taking advantage of the first turn time constraint?
 uvBoss: its 1 sec for the first turn adn 100 for the rest
 Hjax: just search for the whole time on the first move 
 Hjax: do you have a transposition table?
 uvBoss: nope
 Hjax: those are really useful, because they let you reuse info from previous searches 
 uvBoss: yeah i was thinkin bout it
 Hjax: then when you search for 1 second on turn 1 
 Hjax: you see the benefit on turn 2 too 
 uvBoss: ahhhh noice
 Uljahn: make some precalculations, LUTs, node pools
 Hjax: because the table remembers 
 Hjax: the table can also be used for move ordering 
 uvBoss: its like memoization, if u have already calculated just get it
 uvBoss: right?
 Hjax: something like that yeah, but you need to keep track of depth too 
 uvBoss: okok
 Hjax: if youve searched with a lower depth, the answer is not necessarily the same 
 uvBoss: boi this is getting real complex real fast
 Hjax: but you can use the result from the lower depth search for your move ordering 
 Hjax: and maybe get a really fast cutoff
 uvBoss: yea thats what i think really reduces calc time
 uvBoss: if i can get cutoffs ezly
 Hjax: yeah better move ordering is a huge improvement for alphabeta searchers 
 uvBoss: yea ty again
 Hjax: np
 Hjax: chat is very quiet today
 Tim_McSim: Everybody is working hard... :D
 Zerp: if im getting an timeout error without anything else
 Zerp: does that mean it has to be because my code isnt optimized enough?
 eulerscheZahl: or an infinite loop. both is possible
 Zerp: oh right, didn't think of that
 eulerscheZahl: are you Zerplin? Why the new account?
 Zerp: yeah, i still have my old account just wanted to start from scratch on gitc
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 Zerp: trying to learn c#
 Hjax: oh euler is here, chat is now less dead™
 Zerp: immediately regretted it when i was told you could implement f-w in one line in python xD
 Acerbic: why do I have to re-do captcha after every match&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: vs 4 lines with C# if you omit the { }. Floyd Warshall is simple in any language
 eulerscheZahl: except malbolge
 Zerp: oof
 Zerp: mine is 30
 Zerp: hastebin doesnt seem to work for me atm&#160;:/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/EjqiT3Rm">https://pastebin.com/EjqiT3Rm</a>
 eulerscheZahl: seems i did it a little more verbose than i remember.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6364aed5-de13-47b7-ac99-786419b2825b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6364aed5-de13-47b7-ac99-786419b2825b</a>
 eulerscheZahl: do you know named tuples?
 Zerp: dont you need them to retrieve data from functions that returns tuples?
 Zerp: something like this
 Zerp:  Tuple&lt;int[,], int[,]&gt; result
 Zerp: = .... 
 eulerscheZahl: nah. just a newer version of your Tuple&lt;int[,], int[,]&gt;
 Zerp: oh, nope
 eulerscheZahl: both works, new language standard allows more syntactic sugar
 eulerscheZahl: you can have this as return type:
 Zerp: just got it from a SO from probably a decade ago
 eulerscheZahl: (int[,] dist, int[,] next)
 eulerscheZahl: the (..) is the named tuple
 eulerscheZahl: then instead of Item1 and Item2 you can refer to them by name (dist, next)
 Zerp: ah neat
 Zerp: hoped you could do something like that when i realized i needed to return 2 items 
 eulerscheZahl: public static (int[,] dist, int[,] next) findPath(int[,] matrix, int factoryCount){
 Zerp: but the tuple syntax was what i got when i searched for a solution
 eulerscheZahl: at some point it's more readable to just create a new class for the return type
 eulerscheZahl: the old Tuple support up to about 17 generic arguments, gets a mess
 eulerscheZahl: likeTuple&lt;int, string, byte, List&lt;int[,]&gt;, MyClass&gt; theTuple
 Zerp: oh, because you have to declare the types all the time
 eulerscheZahl: and you forget which meaning Item1, Item2, ... have
 Zerp: also don't like how you have to make a temp var to store the items, if you dont want to run the function multiple times
 wlesavo: damn, i only now realised that the move that captures all the seeds in oware is not forbiden, just capturing is not happening
 wlesavo: i though this is simply an illegal move
 wlesavo: and im not even sure if it is worth fixing it
 Zerp: think this is enough info for gitc? i have shortest dist matrix, next vertex matrix, and a matrix that predicts  the next 20 turns  based on troops <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/474511336">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/474511336</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 20 turns is enough
 Hjax: hey eulerscheZahl, are you familiar with mcts solver 
 jacek: are you not?
 Hjax: well, i understand how it works, but i was reading the paper on it 
 Hjax: and there is a part that doesnt make sense to me 
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't read the paper but implemented what i expected it should be like
 jacek: if this paper is about LOA, its a mess
 Hjax: yes the LOA paper, is it just wrong?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg">https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg</a>
 Hjax: because it looks just wrong 
 Hjax: namely the final move selection, they say they select the move that maximizes value + 1/sqrt(rollouts)
 jacek: maybe not wrong but really unreadable
 Hjax: which seems to favor /less/ rollouts instead of more 
 Hjax: which doesnt make sense at all 
 jacek: maybe in this case they meant -
 Hjax: minus would make way more sense 
 jacek: so LCB instead of UCB
 Hjax: but the paper says + 
 Hjax: im glad im not just crazy, and the paper is in fact a mess 
 Hjax: because i was like "man i thought i understood this, but now im not so sure" 
 jacek: well if you choose the A as negative number then its alright :c
 darkhorse64: All of this can be summarized: if your opponent has a winning move, you played a losing. If all your opponents moves are losing, you played a winning move. Backpropagate
 darkhorse64: *losing move*
 Hjax: yeah, i understand that, it was just their final action selection that confused me 
 Hjax: which is apparently because its just wrong 
 Snef: isn't it to favor shortest winning move&#160;?
 Hjax: but what does visit count have to do with winning faster 
 Snef: you said rollouts&#160;?
 Hjax: in mcts non solver, you usually pick the move that had the most visits, but they are picking the move that has the least visits 
 Snef: it makes only sense if they talk about rollout and not visits
 Snef: only makes*
 Hjax: i mispoke, the paper says visits 
 Snef: ok then it's weird
 Snef: you'll try othello mcts&#160;?
 Hjax: thats what im writing 
 Snef: vanilla first or ept&#160;?
 Hjax: vanilla 
 Snef: nice i'm also doing that
 Hjax: i havent written mcts before, usually i do minimax 
 Snef: darkhorse64 the wood boss is ept right&#160;?
 struct: Minimax seems more succesfull so far right?
 struct: at least for othello
 Hjax: the highest mcts is tomatoes i think? 
 Snef: afaik yes
 Hjax: yeah it wouldnt surprise me if minimax was better, but i wanted to learn mcts 
 Hjax: so here i am 
 Hjax: unrelated question, does anyone know of any attempts to use the alphazero style networks (value + policy heads) in an alphabeta searcher? 
 Hjax: youd think policy would be perfect for move ordering 
 jacek: if that would be copatible with eval
 Hjax: value head is eval, policy head is move ordering
 darkhorse64: snef: the boss is mcts/random rollouts/no solver
 PatrickMcGinnisII: good info darkhorse64
 Snef: darkhorse64 how many rollout&#160;?
 darkhorse64: 40k
 Snef: i guess i need to optimize then..
 darkhorse64: think of it as the original OOC wood1.
 Snef: lol
 Snef: not really comparable
 darkhorse64: for strength
 Snef: if i want to do mcts vanilla
 Snef: it's really hard to beat this boss
 Astrobytes: It rekt darkhorse first time around Snef, his own monstrous creation turned against him
 jacek: he didnt reduce time?
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I had to resubmit
 Snef: it's like imagine uttt gold boss =&gt; mcts with 50k roll out
 darkhorse64: Now, if you look at my leaderboard rank, there are other monsters lurking
 darkhorse64: around
 Astrobytes: Yeah, this league is genuinely scary
 jacek: im noob, im still at wood :c
 struct: It's where your bot belongs
 tomatoes: i added flag to node if it solved in either way
 tomatoes: easier than mess with ifinities
 jacek: Hjax btw youre not the first one to complain about paper and asking own sanity
 Astrobytes: I did the same
 Astrobytes: Had to ask Smits about it
 Zerp: is it possible to separate vars in console.write with commas like in js? like console.log("string", var, "string", var, var);
 Zerp: been using $"{var} string {var}" but i find it really slow compared to using commas
 eulerscheZahl: there are some format options, but nothing as "simple" as you want
 eulerscheZahl: i guess the closest would be to put all your variables into a list and the do string.Join(" ", list)
 eulerscheZahl: but the string interpolation is shorter and more readable than string.Join
 jacek: javascript. readable. pick one
 Zerp: don't you think using comma seperation is readable?
 Zerp: you can write console.log("the value of var1 is, var1, and the value of var2 is, var2")
 eulerscheZahl: you forgot some "
 Zerp: yeah xd
 Zerp: but you get the idea
 eulerscheZahl: i did before
 Zerp: it felt amazing going from c to js, going back from js to c# can feel little rough sometimes :p
 Astrobytes: I'm always happier going from JS to C. JS world is a Very Odd Place.
 Zerp: what do the find odd
 Zerp: the typecasting?
 Astrobytes: Everything. It's just... a bit strange&#160;:)I mean it's useful and all, and flexible. Just not my comfortable area
 Zerp: what about python?
 eulerscheZahl: same: no strong typing
 eulerscheZahl: i like python to write a few lines
 eulerscheZahl: not that much when the code gets longer
 Astrobytes: But less strange. I like python for doing bits and pieces here and there, but yeah, what euler said
 Zerp: i guess, havent done a lot of projects more than a few hundred lines
 eulerscheZahl: and I like Django
 Astrobytes: I've only used flask
 Zerp: been fighting this weird bug, just tried recreating it in a separate project. Once i did that it seemed to work as expected, so i guess i have weird typo somewhere t.t 
 code_maniac: Haven't used python so far. But i think in general dynamic typed languages makes it bit easy to start programming
 code_maniac: I think JS has evolved a lot after ES6 earlier there was hell lot of problems, but they are some how trying to cope up with the problems which can be fixed
 Hjax: JS's syntax makes me sad 
 Zerp: example?
 Hjax: i dont have one off the top of my head, its just i find python to be more pleasant to look at in general 
 code_maniac: You can use prettier to have a pleasant looking code 😂"Kidding"
 ekym: everything in JS is sad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: anyone try to run all possible games in othello?  I was thinking the possible games would be around 2.6x10^32 realistically...so would it take like 4M years to run?
 Hjax: you want to solve othello?
 Hjax: good luck
 jacek: its in order of magnitude of checkers which has been solved
 Hjax: checkers is only weakly solved right? 
 Hjax: its known optimal play is a draw 
 Hjax: but the optimal move isnt known for all positions 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Just trying to figure out an opening book,  I guess a could run a local mcts ... but what depth could i shoot for without worrying about time
 Astrobytes: PHP.... hmm... depth 1? :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: locally Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gheesh
 Astrobytes: depth 2 then :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I went thru this with TTT, I could get depth 3 on CG, but I could get 6 on my pc w/o pullin gout my hair
 Astrobytes: There's a bunch of Othello databases out there with loads of games
 Astrobytes: human and computer-based games
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity#Complexities_of_some_well-known_games">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity#Complexities_of_some_well-known_games</a>
 Hjax: othello is tricky because you cant really generate an endgame tablebase for it 
 Hjax: since the board gains complexity as the game goes on, rather than losing it 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx struct, let me borrow a quantum processor for a day or so - so I can kill the P SPACE
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, if you separate the board into concentric rings... and until you own an edge square you avoid the 2nd ring.  Then when you own an edge square you change up the priority to keeping it while not losing a corner, then you can just ride out the end game knowing you have an advantage
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can't do 100k sims, maybe 6k if I'm lucky
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fun to think about, hard to get a hair cut
 Hjax: rings?
 tomatoes: yinsh flasback?
 Acerbic: how in the world did they solve Power of Thor in under 60 chars... ima crying here.
 Acerbic: not really, but 
 Hjax: my best power of thor is 131 in python
 eulerscheZahl: thor never goes north
 Hjax: ^ i laughed so hard at that 
 Hjax: what a silly set of validators 
 eulerscheZahl: indeed :D
 Acerbic: @eulerscheZahl so you just abuse limited testing set?
 eulerscheZahl: or even call another programming language
 eulerscheZahl: write a good bash solution and then do system()
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know if top python solutions use that trick
 eulerscheZahl: i'm stuck at 108 chars&#160;:(that's doable without system calls
 Acerbic: php people just use backtick `. it goes into shell directly. cheats
 Hjax: that would be useful if i had any idea how to code golf in bash 
 Acerbic: i am at 109 in JS now.&#160;:( Thor! 
 AdamB: bash FTW!
 Hjax: my solution uses a while loop, which is probably sub-optimal 
 Hjax: i feel like optimal is probably some "\n".join list comprehension with a zip in it 
 Acerbic: @eulerscheZahl thx for the idea
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Acerbic i never tries I always assumed CG ran in safe-mode
 Acerbic: @PatrickMcGinnisII i definitely have seen someone doing $i=`cat` for reading inputs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gtg, yall have fun
 Astrobytes: cya Patrick
 jacek: hmm unicode counts as 1 character?
 struct: y
 Zerp: isnt there something like smileys counts as 2-3 unicode chars
 struct: ☻
 Zerp: but if you do something like .length, it's 1
 Zerp: if i set a var1 equal to an object and set var2 = var1, does it make a clone or do they both manipulate the same object?
 struct: they both manipulate the same

 struct: ah :p
 struct: I think same still applies
 Zerp: explain a lot t.t
 Zerp: i thought it created a copy
 Zerp: pretty much what i was fighting with all day
 Zerp: but it doesn't seem like there is an easy way to create a copy?
 jacek: :F
 Astrobytes: Knew there was gonna be a dbdr submit incoming
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: Astrobytes, the submit watcher
 Astrobytes: Nah, I saw jacek's :F, figured that was a submit from either you or tric
 dbdr: oh, missed that
 jacek: :s
 Astrobytes: Fking hell
 dbdr: also not sure what :F means
 trictrac: dbdr you are on the road of a full victory wtf&#160;!!!
 Astrobytes: donno either, jacek uses that and :E when things go south
 Hjax: dbdr has decided to give up on losing 
 Hjax: this winning strategy is working much better
 Astrobytes: That is one helluva submit, gg sir, gg
 dbdr: I was thinking exactly that Hijax
 dbdr: I decided to win&#160;:)
 Hjax: what did you change?
 dbdr: everything
 Astrobytes: wreckingMode = true;
 Astrobytes: wow
 trictrac: now it's MCTS&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Seriously
 dbdr: minimax
 Astrobytes: Did you swallow a game database or something?!
 dbdr: do you guys use books?
 Hjax: tric does 
 Astrobytes: Not yet
 trictrac: yes only openings
 dbdr: how did you compute them?
 dbdr: I wonder if that can hurt
 dbdr: losing the same way over and over
 trictrac: Yes it can drive to this behaviour
 dbdr: I saw a couple of scores repeating, but not that much
 jacek: in this pace were gonna solve othello in 2 weeks
 dbdr: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: you cant prove dbdr hasnt already solved it 
 dbdr: solving requires lots of space though
 dbdr: 100K won't cut it
 Hjax: 100% winrate, solved game :P 
 Astrobytes: That really is something,  what a submit
 dbdr: fun thing is, if I stay at 100% winrate and spam submit, I should be able to drive everyone betlow 0, right? :D
 Astrobytes: You've definitely torn us all a new one dbdr
 Astrobytes: lol don't even think about it
 struct: No dbdrt
 struct: you will get to a point
 struct: where you lose points from winning
 Hjax: i like how his score says decreasing even though he hasnt lost yet 
 dbdr: yes, but that's quite high
 dbdr: so maybe not below 0
 Hjax: what? winning should never give you a negative amount, unless the rating system is broken 
 Hjax: limit as rating difference -&gt; infinity, 0 rating change

 struct: Ok its time to increase board size :smiling_imp:
 Hjax: can you make a new league with a bigger board struct? 
 Hjax: then it wont fit in a nice long 
 struct: I could
 Astrobytes: lol you can keep that
 struct: But I said that I wouldn't 
 dbdr: it would only be a problem if two bots were drawing every match
 dbdr: the two top bots
 dbdr: I'm sure my bot can be beaten
 Hjax: it would be funny if Astrobytes won the last game against dbdr
 Hjax: would gain a ton of points 
 Nevykelis: Hello, im new with Haskell, and ofc im struglling with it. So maybe someone has some ideas. Im stuck in puzzles where i need to give output after one move again and again( i hope you understood me :D )  but i cant change my variables values ofc, because its haskell. 
 Astrobytes: lmao, that ain't gonna happen :D
 trictrac: struct don't chose dbdr bot as boss we never see the 10x10 board he will be alone
 dbdr: :D

 struct: ouch
 jacek:&#160;?
 struct: so many skips
 struct: in a row
 dbdr: I optimize for that, among other things
 Hjax: congrats on the perfect submit 
 Hjax: i dont think ive ever seen that before 
 MSmits: grats dbdr
 Astrobytes: Other than in really low wood leagues
 Astrobytes: That was epic, gg sir
 MSmits: is the CG cpu slower these days?
 dbdr: MSmits will you join?
 MSmits: yes, it is a matter of time
 dbdr: cool!
 MSmits: i will do it eventually
 dbdr: bitboarding paradise&#160;;)
 Hjax: he just needs to finish solving uttt :P 
 MSmits: still finishing off schoolyear. Then have to kick some NN ass on Oware also . It;s unnatural to have 3 at the top&#160;:)
 dbdr: 3 roughly equal?
 MSmits: agade is a bit stronger than the others I think
 Astrobytes: I think so
 MSmits: from messing around with parameters
 Supercoder77: php.
 MSmits: i can find many configurations that beat recurse or robo, or both (narrowly), but never agade. I get at most 30%
 dbdr: I'll resub the same, curious how the scores evolve
 jacek: beaten by rust, wha6t a shame
 MSmits: hard to test against
 MSmits: how will I make an opening book vs you dbdr&#160;? :P
 dbdr: nope, I'm sending a compiled version
 MSmits: ohh ok
 dbdr: feel free to test in the IDE
 MSmits: thats nice
 MSmits: is this minimax btw?
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: cool

 struct: why CG is slow
 struct: ...
 Astrobytes: Any hints as to what you changed for this submit, roughly ofc dbdr?
 jacek: i submited and progress halts
 dbdr: yeah, I submitted and no game played&#160;:(
 jacek: so youre last. noob.
 struct: 143 submiting on CSB&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: oh ffs, CSB recalc
 struct: Maybe one day this will be fixed
 Hjax: next contest, performance optimize the csb ref! 
 MSmits: the ref is not the problem is it?:
 MSmits: i would guess the bots are
 Astrobytes: lol struct, I posted it in the bug report
 Hjax: mostly tongue in cheek 
 Astrobytes: As you were posting it in genera;
 Astrobytes: *general
 struct: It's fine
 MSmits: btw, dbdr, I'm the one that suggested someone make othello, hinting that struct should do it, would be kinda odd if i then not wrote a bot :P
 MSmits: just being lazy/slow 
 struct: So each promotion is 100 games right?
 struct: 14300 games
 struct: we will be stuck for a while
 Hjax: what caused this? 
 Hjax: people got bumped above the boss?
 struct: yeah
 struct: or boss got below them
 Astrobytes: :computer: :fire: :fire: :fire:
 AntiSquid: too much CSB advertising
 Hjax: how long will the server take to sort this out?
 Hjax: hours?
 struct: yeah
 AntiSquid: 100k bots in the arena, people calling it a good tutorial, yet how many of those are still active? clearly not a fun game :p
 Hjax: sad 
 Astrobytes: It really can't go on like this
 AntiSquid: blame quid34, obviously the culprit :D
 Supercoder77: bots are lame.
 struct: hmm
 struct: the number increased to 156
 struct: I wonder if the boss is still going down
 Zerp: anyone remember to selectmultiple lines / rows in the ide?
 Zerp: so i can edit 2 lines at once
 zakariamouhid: press alt and click in multi places
 Zerp: ty
 Astrobytes: ctrl+alt + up or down arrows
 Astrobytes: (also)
 dbdr: that changes my desktop :D
 Astrobytes: You can change the key bindings
 SoLiDwAtEr: Hi guys, is it a better strategy to solve puzzles test-case by test-case or try and write an algorithm to solve all test cases in one go - if you're trying to improve your problem solving skills?
 Astrobytes: I *had* to disable Ctrl-S
 dbdr: SoLiDwAtEr: better to solve the general case
 dbdr: testcases are just examples
 SoLiDwAtEr: interesting
 Astrobytes: There are hidden validators to prevent you hardcoding the solution you see
 Astrobytes: 14 losses in a row, then I win against tric&#160;:/
 zakariamouhid: I the IDE that used here like vscode, exist in github&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yeah, Monaco
 Astrobytes: (is the name)
 zakariamouhid: yeah, thank you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: np
 SoLiDwAtEr: okay thanks, i'm terrible at these interview tests in general
 Astrobytes: Just chill, use your language knowledge and apply your brain, you'll be fine
 SoLiDwAtEr: yeah i don't get it, how i struggle with the easy ones and i've got 9 years dev exp lol
 SoLiDwAtEr: god i hate this stuff lol
 NightScap3: dark mode would be so nice
 Astrobytes: Click Settings, to your left of the screen
 Astrobytes: Or Settings 'gear' icon, below chat for the chat

 dbdr: gg jack
 dbdr: jacek
 darkhorse64: still 99%
 darkhorse64: fix it
 dbdr: yeah :D
 dbdr: though I'll probably refactor first
 pardouin: it's when you get 1st in poorly worded CoC vs 8 with only 90% that you realize you should NEVER play with bots
 SoLiDwAtEr: how long should it typically take to solve easy puzzles&#160;?
 pardouin: 20 sec
 SoLiDwAtEr: ah i need to improve then
 pardouin: if you're talking about the "training" part, ofc some of them are longer
 SoLiDwAtEr: yeah i'm talking about the practice easy puzzles like the descent and thor etc
 pardouin: it should be more like ~5min then
 SoLiDwAtEr: i feel like i'm taking too long to solve them but it doesn't really say how long people are taking on average to solve them, would be a nice metric to have
 SoLiDwAtEr: yeah then i'm taking way too long, or thinking about them too long, takes me about 40min-1 hour
 pardouin: if you need practice there are websites with easier problems
 SoLiDwAtEr: thanks, i'll just keep practicing maybe i'll get quicker
 pardouin: to warm you up a bit
 SoLiDwAtEr: i like this one because it's kind of like playin an RPG game
 SoLiDwAtEr: leveling up etc
 pardouin: in CG it's often "game" oriented so only reading about the context, the rules etc is already long ^^
 SoLiDwAtEr: i'm just hoping the more of these puzzles i do, the better i will get 
 pardouin: sure
 SoLiDwAtEr: i've got 9 years dev exp but in real life it's more about design patterns than actually solving algorithms like this
 SoLiDwAtEr: different mindset
 pardouin: have you tried Clash of Clans&#160;?
 SoLiDwAtEr: the mobile game?
 pardouin: it will be hard at first but it's funny
 pardouin: sorry&#160;: clash of Code*
 SoLiDwAtEr: oh no, is that in codingame?
 pardouin: yes
 SoLiDwAtEr: is this collaborating with other people etc?
 pardouin: you compete against players /bots to solve problems as fast as possible or with as few characters as possible
 SoLiDwAtEr: ah right, i won't be any good at that if it's taking me so long to do the easy puzzles lol
 pardouin: well, give it a try, sometimes it's really easy
 SoLiDwAtEr: sure, i will do some more of these easy puzzles first as i've only done the descent and power of thor 1 at the moment
 SoLiDwAtEr: and then i might try something like clash of code
 SoLiDwAtEr: or do you think that clash of code will help me improve quicker?
 pardouin: you can do both
 SoLiDwAtEr: :thumbsup_tone4:
 badAtCoding: clash of code = fun!!!
 Acerbic: to hell with this site! clash of code is fun, but doing recaptcha after EVERY MATCH is too much for me. Goodbye y'all.
 Hjax: clash of code isnt the main appeal of this site in a lot of peoples opinion
 simpledark: any other sites similar to clash of code guys?
 Hjax: not that im aware of 
 LelouchVC2: not if ur based outside of The pacific ocen

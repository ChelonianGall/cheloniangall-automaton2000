 Durkin: gods, the don't panic code golf quest is going to drive me nutty. Got C++ to 209, but now I'm dead in the water
 MadKnight: Durkin u can show your code to me in the DM i might give u some hints
 Maxlaughter: can i change ide color?
 ninnghazad: and on the left
 Raghuveer: can anyone help wood 1 mad pod racing python
 JJWooster: does anyone find the autocomplete features with the built in IDE kinda buggy?
 JJWooster: whenever I type in "()" and hit enter, it just deletes the "()"
 JJWooster: and it somehow does not remember any of my variables
 programX: what is clash of code
 JJWooster: it's a short competition between you and 7 other people
 Uljahn: or bots
 JJWooster: you compete to either be the first to arrive at the solution, or have the shortest source code
 JJWooster: I have been hearing that there are bots
 JJWooster: I don't suspect there are that many bots
 Uljahn: there are official bots to compensate a lack of participants
 JJWooster: true, but I think there is a significant number of real people in the playerbase
 JJWooster: how much out of the 200k participants do you think are bots?
 JJWooster: I just realized the little logo you have lol
 Uljahn: you don't need many bots to fill in a lobby
 Uljahn: also those bots just repost other people solutions
 JJWooster: interesting
 JJWooster: so they're prolly not the ones that submit the 0% solutions, right&gt;
 JJWooster:&#160;?*
 programX: how to debug?
 JJWooster: as in tools provided by the IDE? I don't think there are any...
 programX: i cant test my code
 JJWooster: ah
 JJWooster: do you see "test cases"?
 Uljahn: read the comments in the default code
 programX: no I need "DEBUG" not test
 JJWooster: I think you're in my lobby
 Uljahn: or try some easy puzzles, it should be there, not sure about clash of code
 DEVQEZ_ENTERTAINMENT: Hello

 juma: Feature requests: Can I get all my solutions commited in a github repo? thank you!
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Do you want some tea with it?
 MadKnight: juma there's History tab with all of your submissions
 MadKnight: u can just make a browser ext to display it as a git repo
 juma: also, when is the IA you are training with our solutions coming out? or does this go directly into copilot? :P
 MadKnight: that would be WAY inefficient
 MadKnight: and a bad idea
 MadKnight: cmon
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Cg staff is not on the chat juma, tou're speaking to simple users...
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: *you
 juma: I know, just letting it out
 MadKnight: i think he's speaking to the mods
 MadKnight: to pass it up the chain
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Anyway, "not a priority"
 juma: I just thought of the amount of code being generated by codingame as data to train a problem solving AI
 MadKnight: sounds great, doesn't work
 juma: sound like you tried already
 MadKnight: imagine trying to learn chinese by reading infinite number of problem descriptions and problem solution explanations all in chinese
 MadKnight: u need a reference data
 juma: isn't gpt-3 doing exactly that?
 MadKnight: well if u see a weird X symbol usually going after some weird VA symbol then u would assume u would need to generate X after seeing VA without even knowing what it means
 MadKnight: and that's what gpt-3 is doing
 MadKnight: it remembers what things go after what and it tries to reconstruct the most casual case scenario thing
 MadKnight: based on its knowledge
 MadKnight: without having any idea what any of that means
 juma: like github's copilot?
 MadKnight: um
 juma: don't you think bots will soon  compete and win code challenges?
 MadKnight: u watched too much of terminator movies
 MadKnight: pls
 MadKnight: next u gonna say u believe in magic and stuff
 MadKnight: okay so anyway
 MadKnight: do u know how to make browser extensions&#160;?
 juma: LOL you'll swallow your words
 juma: but enjoy while this game is still human to human
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :rofl:
 MadKnight: oh no the bots already made a fake human player to spy on humans
 MadKnight: he was right all along
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u back yet?
 MadKnight: astrodude is not here yet 
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Automaton2000 will rule the world!
 MadKnight: not sure he's coming back by himself anytime soon

 MadKnight: hihi squiddy
 MadKnight: u seen the new fancy show about the squid game&#160;?
 AntiSquid: basically the 500th version of a Battle Royale series
 AntiSquid: sort of ...
 AntiSquid: it gets boring when you read or watch the same theme over and over again
 AntiSquid: almost as dull as the zombie apocalypse theme
 AntiSquid: when are new ideas going to be promoted&#160;?
 MadKnight: look it's all about the production and not the basic idea
 AntiSquid: which part of production&#160;?
 MadKnight: it doens't matter that the idea has been used before
 AntiSquid: squid game wasn't even the best show based on battle royale
 MadKnight: it only matters if they produced the end product badly
 AntiSquid: far from it
 MadKnight: i mean
 AntiSquid: well it's bad LOL
 MadKnight: imagine if 50 people made 50 versions with the same idea and all 50 were really bad
 MadKnight: and then in a year some team made a really good product from that idea
 MadKnight: would u still say the same words &gt;
 MadKnight:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i didn't see Liar Game live action, but the anime and manga version is a one of the best stories when it comes to battle royale theme
 AntiSquid: well squid game was really crap
 MadKnight: why
 AntiSquid: i watched at double speed the entire time and it was still too slow
 AntiSquid: watch Liar Game, it's FAR FAR BETTER, the games are more interesting, there's more depth to the story and the puzzles
 MadKnight: oh so u like dynamics
 MadKnight: and stuff
 AntiSquid: squid game was just bullshit, human suffering, gore porn, just like the movie: Passion of Christ where some guy gets whipped up where they could instead focus on more interesting bits even for a bible story they picked the worst plot LOL
 Gattling: hello
 AntiSquid: i like an actual story, squid game is lacking one
 AntiSquid: it's a shitty copy of the theme
 MadKnight: just say the word
 AntiSquid: which word&#160;??
 MadKnight: "predictable"
 AntiSquid: i told you go watch Liar Game if you want something decent / good 
 MadKnight: can't stand because it's too predictable
 MadKnight: well i'll give your thing a try AntiSquid
 Midnight2441: based on what ive heard squid game is like amazons Panic
 AntiSquid: i mean the torture methods weren't predictable but the plot was very shallow
 Uljahn: i liked Bokurano, guess it's battle royale themed too
 eulerscheZahl: it's like "the cube" as a show with multiple episodes
 Midnight2441: it seems like they take a few themes and throw them together
 Astrobytes: I have no idea what any of you are talking about :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the mandatory endless talks and character development that you have at netflix productions
 AntiSquid: bokurano is more like a "ten little kids" story, where the plot kills one at a time
 AntiSquid: in squid game there's a versus mode element
 eulerscheZahl: some netflix show where people have to play small kids games for life and death
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't miss much
 Astrobytes: sounds... crap
 Gattling: hello

 Gattling: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2887b9bd-d5ea-4b96-bc21-6fb8afc8d72e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2887b9bd-d5ea-4b96-bc21-6fb8afc8d72e</a>
 Midnight2441: honestly i havent seen it but the adds suck
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow it's one of the most successful shows on netflix ever
 AntiSquid: hi Gattling nice to meet you
 eulerscheZahl: nice to have met you*
 AntiSquid: i expect he'll make a new account or private message me
 AntiSquid: he's following me
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if the ban was really necessary
 eulerscheZahl: maybe he just wanted to share the code to ask for help and was surprised by the pastebin
 DomiKo: "but somehow it's one of the most successful shows on netflix ever" show is available in many languages
 DomiKo: that's a part of success
 AntiSquid: hmmmm, i could be wrong but that looks like starter code and full intent to spam
 AntiSquid: ill intent i mean
 eulerscheZahl: i just like to give the benefit of a doubt. you can always ban later when there is no more doubt
 logicwhiz: hi
 AntiSquid: domiko i might be absolutely wrong, but some shows get pushed and advertised a lot, they aren't the best out there, you can usually fid much better alternatives
 AntiSquid: hello logicwhiz
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 still rip
 Jerrasterix: What happend to him&#160;?? he was offline on sunday too :disappointed:
 AntiSquid: MadKnight what have you been coding recently&#160;?
 MadKnight: Jerrasterix it's simple
 MadKnight: euler is out there for blood
 AntiSquid: he banned the bot&#160;? :O
 MadKnight: just kicked
 eulerscheZahl: and gave astro the fault
 MadKnight: framed astro because he was in a really bad mood and was raging from any ping to autommy
 struct: I banned him earlier today

 MadKnight: why is everyone framing everyone
 MadKnight: today
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Sad only the bot get punished...
 AntiSquid: CG chat battle royale
 struct: yes, madknight got automaton banned
 MadKnight: sounds like a u problem Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Nope. Definitely you MadKnight.
 MadKnight: naaaaa
 AntiSquid: why are you pissing on people MadKnight&#160;?
 <b>**struct unbans automaton</b></p><p><img src="/a/61978887534411" /> AntiSquid: you know what site was more fun back when madao kun was mod and more lenient
 AntiSquid: more users too, but we also had more contests :thinking:
 Astrobytes: No, the chat was just full of complete and utter crap every day.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Why did he even get unbanned...
 MadKnight: BlaiseVonEbuthIV why are u still not banned your jokes are terrible
 struct: maybe you should also apply for unban blaise
 AntiSquid: people having fun = crap ... hum 
 MadKnight: (lost context from #fr)
 AntiSquid: well no wonder chat is dying
 derjack: with such moderators...
 MadKnight: Astrobytes i don't think we saw anyone else who was annoyed by that
 MadKnight: it was barely a few messages
 Astrobytes: Fine. Continue.
 AntiSquid: i fk up some times, but i don't pretend to be flawless, do i&#160;? derjack

 eulerscheZahl: lasts longer than kicking you MK
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Naaa Struct. I'm disruptive, when he's only flooding, harasing people, and saying discriminative shit. He can be unbanned, not me...
 AntiSquid: were you pinging bot MK&#160;?
 AntiSquid: liek cyberpunk&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: I no longer care. Not moderating or complaining about anything. Don't want to kill MK and squiddys 'fun' yo usee.
 MadKnight: not sure when i said discriminative shit ever in my life
 Astrobytes: *you see
 AntiSquid: overreacting
 AntiSquid: chat is dead most of the time
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i'll lean back and let others deal with MK
 AntiSquid: if it's just ping after ping i get it
 Astrobytes: Yep euler.
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl don't worry just use some :popcorn:
 struct: well it was like 5 pings in 1 minute
 eulerscheZahl: we had a conversation going and MK spammed the Automaton
 AntiSquid: site is dead, hate to say it, but there's not much going on, it just happens to have a chat
 goosewithnocapitalletters: i like trains&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you can keep shut if you want and you can enjoy your lives
 AntiSquid: i mean I can keep shut lol

 MadKnight: i actually never blamed u for doing that euler
 MadKnight: i'm just arguing with some people about nothing
 goosewithnocapitalletters: what do you meaaannnn
 MadKnight: because i need to finish my :popcorn:
 AntiSquid: madao what are you up to lately
 MadKnight: up to dealing with my haters in #world
 MadKnight: they really do love me
 goosewithnocapitalletters: who is the hater
 AntiSquid: come on, tell me about something work on
 Midnight2441: imagine sitting in class and doing this instead of your work
 struct: I think minecraft got the best of you
 MadKnight: okay i'm working on an IOs app

 MadKnight: AntiSquid do u know much about iOS development&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no, you can tell me, also why ios and not android&#160;?
 MadKnight: it's for work
 goosewithnocapitalletters: ios is better
 MadKnight: they need their app in appstore
 MadKnight: apple got a pretty nice UI library
 MadKnight: they got like json + html mixed together into swift language directly so u can basically write if statement logic and stuff inside of your html/json UI code
 MadKnight: and it updates everything automatically once u change values of variables
 MadKnight: AntiSquid and what do u work on&#160;?
 AntiSquid: not much atm, i wouldn't be jumping around sites otherwise
 AntiSquid: just some basic plugin hahaha, waiting for more requirements
 MadKnight: AntiSquid make a browser ext that acts like a git repo manager based on your submit history on CG
 AntiSquid: what's the point in that?
 MadKnight: idk some dude asked for that today in the morning
 AntiSquid: perfect opportunity for him to make it and add it to his portofolio
 MadKnight: well i told him that but he didn't seem to have any interest
 AntiSquid: speak to you some other time mado, i go away, let people enjoy their dead chat

 12_monkey_21: I am stuck on cryptex
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that one over and inaccessible to anyone?
 12_monkey_21: I have acces to it

 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :grin:
 jacek: whos the 1st guy on thor codegolf?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: The one with the shortest code.
 eulerscheZahl: fall challenge 2021 = the curse of the 5 warriors
 eulerscheZahl: steam house is another one it seems
 ninnghazad: 12_monkey_21 that's not the fall challenge, it's an escape room puzzle named "the steam house"but i didn't to that one
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't played any of them so i can't help
 12_monkey_21: sad, I all most there, but, I am stuck yeay thanks for reply. 
 Uljahn: aren't there hints available?
 12_monkey_21: Yes, but, I followed those hints, somehow I match them wrong
 12_monkey_21: 4 paintings with dots, 4 wheels pointing a number, then one grid to match them, when i do that I get a combination that is not correct
 12_monkey_21: So there aren't any hints aviable anymore
 12_monkey_21: i tried every possiblity I could think of
 jacek: try discord
 eulerscheZahl: youtube spoilers
 12_monkey_21: I tried the youtube spoilers already I couldn't find a thing about the steam house on youtube
 12_monkey_21: I will try discord

 eulerscheZahl: copyright concerns
 jacek: nah, unless youre from us
 Westicles: you can't copyright a god
 bigboi29: hey i need some help with the mars landing 
 eulerscheZahl: i also think they go further than necessary with it

 Westicles: mars landing... where's that PID paper wont links that looks like gibberish?
 eulerscheZahl: the game that i'm mostly concerned about: botters of the galaxy
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe the bender trilogy

 Win4life: bro the game is broken&#160;:
 eulerscheZahl: they only review their own official content so far
 bigboi29: oh yes harder daddy
 struct: Dont they just need to change the name if someone asks them too?
 eulerscheZahl: 300000 solved thor, must be broken right?
 struct: idk how it works tbh
 Win4life: i dont know lol
 Win4life: i am broken&#160;:(
 struct: maybe if i solve in 8 languages it counts 8 times
 eulerscheZahl: if you do an obvious violation, they can just sue you
 Win4life: i am doing this just for practice
 eulerscheZahl: it's just where to draw the line. taking a popular title like "ghost in the shell" and changing it to "ghost in the cell" is fine IMO as long as you don't take major parts of the original
 eulerscheZahl: (not a laywer - and even if, it's different depending on your country laws)
 Win4life: true..

 Win4life: if i complitly copy and pase the hint /solution it works
 Win4life: so idk

 eulerscheZahl: jacek already told you what to change
 struct: 1.579 solved onboarding
 Win4life: ehh
 struct: mill
 eulerscheZahl: Mühle
 Win4life: bro i am just blind, 
 Win4life: even duo you told me i was like where&gt;.....
 Westicles: the world also needs fry cooks
 Win4life: yeah but i design cars doing this for fun of it
 jacek: design cars?
 Westicles: hopefully not self-driving? 
 jacek: they can only go N or S
 Win4life: nah they go side to side )0
 Win4life: so i am new here, is evryone like a strong programmer here?
 Win4life: or there are from all levels?
 jacek: all levels
 Linglee: absolute beginner here&#160;:)
 Win4life: Yey
 jacek: but we make fun of all of them
 TiopazHc: a question in an equation "^" == "**" is it power in python?
 jacek: ^ is xor. ** is power
 TiopazHc: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-her-majestys-well-shared-secret/83197/2">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-her-majestys-well-shared-secret/83197/2</a>
 TiopazHc: in this game is xor?
 jacek: you asked for python. ^ means xor. for most math stuff ^ means power as well in this puzzle
 TiopazHc: yes but in an equation notation if it is true?
 struct: that ^ 2 is power
 TiopazHc: good but even so I do not get it, it only comes out with 2 parts "K"&#160;:( in a linear quadratic equation
 eulerscheZahl: do you need a hint for the shared secret?
 jacek: thats secret!
 TiopazHc: according to what I understood while there are more parts there are more variables if there are 3 parts then there are 3 unknowns and the last one is the answer but I am trying with the gaus method but it does not work ..
 eulerscheZahl: and you have a power modulo something. there's a way to compute this in the opposite direction: "modular inverse"
 eulerscheZahl: and that's where we are entering the field of maths
 <b>**struct runs</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: that way you'll never get good at codeforces
 jacek: math :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the jacek reaction coming
 struct: ik euler
 TiopazHc: How can I be good without math?&#160;:'v
 jacek: try meth, its close
 eulerscheZahl: or a bath?
 struct: I think thats the right path
 eulerscheZahl: now we are talking about a graph?
 TiopazHc: I do not understand what they say my translator from English to Spanish fails :v
 eulerscheZahl: we are making puns
 eulerscheZahl: finding words that sound similar to "math"
 Janglehoth: you're about to feel my wrath
 eulerscheZahl: struct speaks Portuguese. Would that help you?
 eulerscheZahl: struct translate for him
 Janglehoth: I speak google translate
 struct: I think google translate might do a better job than me
 eulerscheZahl: excuses, you are just lazy
 jacek: wrath? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/nGlrTRxLjxY?t=80">https://youtu.be/nGlrTRxLjxY?t=80</a>
 GunchLV: wrath of sociopath goliath
 Janglehoth: I felt that wrath...
 Janglehoth: Bruh I can't even get past this second level of Mad pod racing :expressionless:
 struct: whats wrong?
 eulerscheZahl: the name. new users will never know
 struct: shouldnt they also rename the contest?
 Janglehoth: I have no clue what it's asking me to do with the x and y for pods position. Nor what it wants with the nextCheckpointDist. lol
 jacek: targetY targetY?
 Janglehoth: I haven't even gotten to any target stuff yet... lolOr are you talking about the nextCheckpointX and Y?
 TiopazHc: I want the track
 jacek: but i think youre past that
 Janglehoth: Yeah! This is the level right after that. lol
 Janglehoth: Yeah barely past it :sweat_smile:
 Janglehoth: Aaayy I did something. Thanks guys lol
 jacek: :duck:
 Samzok123: hi
 Win4life: you guys like listening to music?
 jacek: eulerscheZahl thats question for you
 witschl: yea i usually listen to music
 TiopazHc: equals
 jacek: and the chat is dead again ~
 TiopazHc: yes
 jacek: Automaton2000 where are you
 AutomatoNN: there is a bug in my code
 jacek: eulerscheZahl hes back!
 jacek: AutomatoNN what do you think of euler
 jacek:&#160;:(
 jacek: euler dont ban him this time
 AutomatoNN: euler is a noob
 jacek: AutomatoNN where is Automaton2000
 Scarfield: xD
 Automaton2000: and you are good at it
 Automaton2000: it would be more fun than i thought
 jacek: :tada:
 <b>**struct kicks Automaton2000</b></p><p><img src="/a/40502662118268" /> Automaton2000: i was doing it in c++
 Scarfield: astro said i almost got banned by magu_s from that, wont do that again 
 Scarfield: does it say scarfield or automatoNN in my chatname for u btw?
 struct: scarfield
 Scarfield: nice, it used to not update that fast i think
 Stilgart: Automaton2000&#160;?
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Automaton2000: if you paste it in
 jacek: oO
 TiopazHc: ik euler?
 SpooterPoof: Howdy everyone! I'm learning C# all over again. How goes it?
 Miyukiko: Why didn't we get CodePoints for the latest event here?
 Miyukiko: Does somebody know?
 Miyukiko: Smells like something dishonest a bit...
 Thorcode: THe fall challenge give us no point
 Miyukiko: Whyyyyy
 Miyukiko: :cry:
 Thorcode: that challenge just make for fun and improve teamate
 Miyukiko: Contests without public evaluation do provide a feeling of being lost in time in some degree...
 Wontonimo: :wave: SpooterPoof
 TiopazHc: hello
 Wontonimo: hey hey.  Working on any multi TiopazHc&#160;?
 TiopazHc: How do I answer in red for a single person?
 Wontonimo: without your nanme
 Wontonimo: with TiopazHc 's name
 TiopazHc: Wontonimo Asi?
 Wontonimo: if you start on their name then press tab, it will autocomplte
 Thorcode: I only red in the other screen
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode , now it's red for you
 Thorcode: yep
 TiopazHc: Wontonimo yes
 Wontonimo: and some more red Thorcode, just so you don't think you are missing out
 Thorcode: ok
 Wontonimo: i see you've entered a multi last year TiopazHc .  Do you see any that catch your interest, or do you want some tips for the multis you are in?
 TiopazHc: #openWontonimo
 Thorcode: can someone tell me why my screen black when I run a test case
 Thorcode: my output screen
 ninnghazad: bug i think, have that too.
 ninnghazad: reload only fix for me
 Westicles: we are not your screen's keeper
 Thorcode: it's only turn black on the output screen of CG
 Thorcode: not all of my screen
 ninnghazad: ye, that's what i mean
 Wontonimo: yes, Westicles is authorized to fly to your house and do IT repairs on your hardware.  All paid for
 Wontonimo: by CG
 ninnghazad: you have to feed them ,tho
 Thorcode: but when i use another screen it not black like that
 Thorcode: broswer
 Westicles: Thorcode, a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth
 Thorcode: why do I need a fugitive and a vagabond Westicles?
 Westicles: &lt;now that CG is a US company, we need more biblical references in the chat&gt;
 Thorcode: why?
 Wontonimo: because of the bible thumpers there

 FreeBugs: a question bout python3:what does * be4 a function e.g. print(*sorted(a) MEAN?
 JJWooster: it kinda concatenates all the elements in the collection with a space between each
 JJWooster: basically the same as ' '.join(your_list)
 JJWooster: if im not mistaken
 JJWooster: actually learned that a few hours ago

 GamingKiller006: hi
 KamalOS: why can't message people in private?
 KamalOS: There was a button next to follow?
 KamalOS: for "message private"
 davilla: you can if they're in chat
 KamalOS: thanks
 gilufin: I think only if they follow you
 Tiramon: just click on the name of a person in chat and a pm will open up KamalOS
 Tiramon: same for the user list in the bottom of the chat
 KamalOS: ok thanks all
 KamalOS: but how to tag sm1like u tag me Tiramon
 KamalOS: + I saw sm1 in Clash of Code multiple timesHe got 1st place in all of thembut he is not sharing his codeso I want to message him
 jacek: :c
 KamalOS: AnywayHow can I tag sm1 here in chat?
 davilla: well he might be a bot, I don't know for sure
 davilla: but there's not a lot of activity at this time, typically
 davilla: otherwise, there's a chat for the clash
 davilla: if you type his name, it will alert him
 davilla: like when I say KamalOS
 KamalOS: ok tnx davilla
 gigolo: X)
 poweroverwhelming: @lysk
 Whatar: So if you are levl 20 you can approve contributions?
 Whatar: maybe I didn't quite understand the conversation
 Whatar: enlighten me
 davilla: if you are level 20 you can approve puzzles
 davilla: not sure at what level you can approve clash of code, but that comes first
 Uljahn: have to play 50 clashes
 Uljahn: not private
 davilla: ah, there ya go
 davilla: so I guess it's possible that it doesn't come first&#160;!? that would be odd

 Tannazsh: hey  
 Tannazsh: hi hru all i'm new here
 Tannazsh: can someone tell me how can i get around here&#160;?
 Manchi_o6o7: someone who could help me with directories in C
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89d2c2de-7b16-4206-9d32-c7c138656802">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89d2c2de-7b16-4206-9d32-c7c138656802</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: it isn't printing anything
 davilla: what is unos.txt&#160;?
 Manchi_o6o7: there I get the input form
 davilla: do you know if it's reading any input?
 Manchi_o6o7: I know what is wrong. The memory allocation for the stirng arrays
 Manchi_o6o7: char *brand=(char*)malloc(count), this is holding only one char?
 Manchi_o6o7: it should be an array of char pointers dynamically. If I am not mistaken.
 davilla: wow, I would not have gotten that
 Manchi_o6o7: Is it the case, what do you think?
 davilla: sorry I can read C/C++ but I get lost with some of that
 Manchi_o6o7:&#160;:(
 Pinux: whats a language worth learning?
 davilla: C# isn't bad
 KalamariKing: Tannazsh wdym?
 Bellololol: Japanese&#160;:) 
 Bellololol: haHAA
 KalamariKing:&#160;?
 gigolo: o/
 KalamariKing: Oh hello gigolo
 gigolo: hi
 KalamariKing: which reminds me nice work with the weekly puzzle struct
 Intp: anyone wanna play a coding escape game.
 gigolo: yeahhh
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, what could be the problem. The first time I excuted my C code, it worked. Completly fine reading from a .txt. The second time I compiled it and it won't print. The code is the same.
 gigolo: check the input file
 Manchi_o6o7: it is the same
 DaNinja: whats it supposed to do?
 Manchi_o6o7: to read %s %s %d
 Manchi_o6o7: I can paste the code, if it helps
 DaNinja: why realloc every line?
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7342664-b323-43c1-ae5b-c48c97cdcd12">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7342664-b323-43c1-ae5b-c48c97cdcd12</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: just playing wiht it
 Manchi_o6o7: practicing for an exam
 Manchi_o6o7: someone?
 DaNinja: when you realloc *array then you cant print array[count-1]
 DaNinja: dont realloc every line
 Manchi_o6o7: how should I do it, because I don't know how much lines will be there
 DaNinja: you want to store all the lines into an array?
 Manchi_o6o7: array of structs
 Manchi_o6o7: dynamically
 Passifi: does anyone know why its called big endian if it actually ends on the least significant byte&#160;? This throws me for a loop everytime ^^ it doesn't end on big it ends on little :scream:
 Manchi_o6o7: it starts on the big hahahahah
 Passifi: ohhh so now I get it the end of the data is stored in the little memory location... this is just such a confusing way to call things ... ^^ Somebody needs to reform computer speech asap
 RoboStac: Manchi_o6o7 - you are can't do a realloc on a pointer that isn't currently allocated (eg line 16 you realloc array[count-1].brand and thats currently an undefined pointer as it's never been assigned)
 Manchi_o6o7: array=(PHONE*)realloc(array,(count+1)*sizeof(PHONE));
 Manchi_o6o7: isn't this part allocating it
 Manchi_o6o7: I solved it
 Manchi_o6o7: without the allocation of struct parts, it works
 RoboStac: thats allocating the pointer to the structures. The pointers inside the structures are still undefined
 Manchi_o6o7: got it
 Manchi_o6o7: thanks a lot
 Manchi_o6o7: if someone wants to see how it works 
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87fd1af6-9f22-443b-82c4-fa9b682639c3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87fd1af6-9f22-443b-82c4-fa9b682639c3</a>
 KalamariKing: And we back, howdy all
 KalamariKing: Someone explain Python to me: what is the difference between int() and math.floor() for positive numbers
 Manchi_o6o7: floor takes the bottom of a floating point number
 Manchi_o6o7: floor(8.6)=8
 Manchi_o6o7: the difference is only with negative numbers
 Manchi_o6o7: int(8.6)=8
 Manchi_o6o7: floor(-5.5)=-6
 Manchi_o6o7: int(-5.5)=-5
 KalamariKing: I knew about the negative difference, but why does it give a different response?
 Astrobytes: 'bottom part'
 KalamariKing: Dealing with absolute values, so it would all be positive
 KalamariKing: Replacing int() with floor() passed test cases int() would not
 Astrobytes: -6 &lt; -5.5, -5 &gt; -5.5, hence floor returns the former
 KalamariKing: Hmm, thanks
 KalamariKing: That makes more sense
 KalamariKing: Imagine switching classes in the middle of a clash and wasting 10 minutes of precious time to get back and nobody's done
 azriel1rf: How can I suppress badge count for community?
 struct: Which badges?
 jacek: click them
 jacek: the contributions page
 azriel1rf: thanks
 struct: What was he talking about jacek?
 jacek: when theres new contribution theres badge in community tab
 azriel1rf: anyway, the count seems not related to me. what does it mean?
 struct: new contributions
 azriel1rf: all the new post?
 struct: number of new contributions
 struct: yes
 azriel1rf: thanks
 azriel1rf: *in my opinion*, it's useful to count only post related to me such as reply or comment to my post.
 azriel1rf: or, it can be selectable all the post or related to me
 MSmits: I know you don't mean it like that, but this sounds funny to me :P
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: it's like you're saying: Hey, I got to this forum and people were talking about something other than me, whats up with that
 azriel1rf: :thinking:
 MSmits: again, i know you dont mean that, but i read it like that at first :P
 azriel1rf: We can select 
 azriel1rf: We can select "world" tab and specific user.
 Kitkat260: hey MSmits

 KalamariKing: Howdy
 KalamariKing: What if we used a genetic nn to determine nn node nums
 jacek: in other words, neuroevolution
 KalamariKing: Is that a thing

 KalamariKing: its big brain time
 bossyboots: hello 
 Astrobytes: Stop.
 Astrobytes: Hammertime!
 Westicles: jacek, that sounds like all those professors in the 80s trying to make AI bugs
 Marchete: :regional_indicator_n::regional_indicator_e::regional_indicator_u::regional_indicator_r::regional_indicator_o::regional_indicator_e::regional_indicator_v::regional_indicator_o::regional_indicator_l::regional_indicator_u::regional_indicator_t::regional_indicator_i::regional_indicator_o::regional_indicator_n:
 jacek: huh
 Marchete: == crappy GA that does sh*t on multi AIs
 jacek: you tried?
 darkhorse64: you can also write a GA to tune the weights of your NN but it does not look like an optimal way to train
 jacek: or NN topology - numbers of layers, nodes etc
 jacek: good luck tuning millions of parameters
 Marchete: why a GA? it can be any other search arlgo
 Marchete: algo*
 KalamariKing: Right but a GA will slowly hone in on parameters, plus I'm not too familiar with other algos
 jacek: GA is smart brute force. brute forcing thousands or millions parameters is a no-no
 Marchete: anyone knows about Span&lt;T&gt; and Memory&lt;T&gt; on C# .Net? 
 Marchete: I'm a bit out of the loop
 jacek: try writing inside the loop's { } 
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 Marchete: solved! thanks jacek :D
 eulerscheZahl: these seem to convert into low-level code like SIMD iirc
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to test them at a recent topcoder marathon. but they still use Mono and an older C# version
 eulerscheZahl: and don't even compile with unsafe
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: also congrats struct for you puzzle of the 3 days
 eulerscheZahl: for your*
 jacek: of 3 days? will it change?
 eulerscheZahl: contest starts soon
 KalamariKing: Oh sick
 KalamariKing: 3 days lets go
 jacek: yeah, who wants a puzzle of the week during contest
 eulerscheZahl: exactly rotated jacek
 eulerscheZahl: kjace
 jacek: ajcke
 Marchete: if euler doesn't know them we are doomed
 Astrobytes: kja... ffs
 eulerscheZahl: I saw djoums using the Span&lt;T&gt; in some published solutions
 Marchete: btw .Net makes working with AVX2 a piece of cake
 Marchete: Span is like a pointer + size
 Marchete: like a window to manipulate stuff
 Astrobytes: Ah, the clue is in the name I guess
 Marchete: I ported my NN to .net fairly good
 Marchete: and with a good performance
 ChavyMush31: this website is jank init mush
 Marchete: but a lot of websites praise about Memory&lt;T&gt; and Span&lt;T&gt; and I'm a bit old
 Marchete: I'm like C# 2.0
 Astrobytes: No ChavyMush31
 ChavyMush31:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i recently used the interface implementation to get something like multiple inheritance
 ZarthaxX: toooooooooooad
 eulerscheZahl: foooox
 KalamariKing: ChavyMush31 First off, why, I think this site is quite great. Much less toxic than, say, s/oSecond off could you say that in english
 ZarthaxX: damn bear sounded better
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: multiple inheritance doesnt sound good
 ChavyMush31: yo my mums a shoe stylllllll
 ZarthaxX: ban?
 ChavyMush31: yo mans a boxennit
 eulerscheZahl: kick
 ZarthaxX: damn
 Astrobytes: Ban next time
 eulerscheZahl: i'm out of shape, let's start slowly&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Upping your kill count before the contest euler? :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: anyone with a highly efficient BFS on a hex board for me?
 ZarthaxX: nope
 KalamariKing: Seems the trolls are out today
 ZarthaxX: if its a small hex boeard you could apply bitboards
 ZarthaxX: e.e
 eulerscheZahl: s/today/toady
 Marchete: hex? why hex?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: the new contest has it?
 ZarthaxX: yes Marchete
 ZarthaxX: 3 hex boards in parallel
 eulerscheZahl: maybe, i have such a feeling
 Marchete: then I'm out
 Marchete: I hate hex
 eulerscheZahl: no, just 1
 ChavyMush31: hi guys
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ChavyMush31: im sorry
 ZarthaxX: wait, the contest is a hex board?
 Astrobytes: ChavyMush31: Ban if you continue
 ZarthaxX: no joke?
 ChavyMush31: sorry blud mans got back yanno
 ChavyMush31: no im sory
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 ChavyMush31: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: i'm serious. but obviously i don't have any insider knowledge
 Astrobytes: Yes, I am aware that you got back.
 ZarthaxX: im not liking how this is turning out
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Astrobytes: He's just talking like a roadman
 ZarthaxX: AstroShame
 eulerscheZahl: even Automaton2000 is more coherent
 Automaton2000: guys i have a project to work on the code
 eulerscheZahl: MK sometimes is
 ZarthaxX: meanwhile im trying to enter into an IT Bootcamp iof a big company here
 ZarthaxX: gonna mess with my cg contest schedule
 Marchete: 11000 registered?
 ChavyMush31: mans a ford focus styll
 Marchete: like wth
 ChavyMush31: mans mum is a box yanno
 ZarthaxX: Marchete but not all of them appear :P
 ChavyMush31: mans a drill artist stylllllll
 ChavyMush31: boogey bano
 ChavyMush31: bando
 eulerscheZahl: i won't defend him if you do what you think about doing Astrobytes
 ChavyMush31: my sister is bandokay
 Marchete: can you ban him?
 eulerscheZahl: he did
 Astrobytes: Done.
 KalamariKing: epic
 ZarthaxX: good
 KalamariKing: How would you go about traversing a hex board though?
 Marchete: perfection
 Astrobytes: Why he feels the need to talk like an inner city London roadman I do not know. Innit blud, get me
 ZarthaxX: you can represent it in a matrix KalamariKing
 eulerscheZahl: just BFS with more neighboring cells
 ZarthaxX: take each row and shift it
 ZarthaxX: you can look it up online :P
 Marchete: pick the referee and do a heavy C&amp;P
 ZarthaxX: ^
 eulerscheZahl: coders of the caribbean
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's the link from the CotC statement
 ZarthaxX: that's the one ^
 ZarthaxX: it's perfect
 eulerscheZahl: (not "code of the rings" here)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Amit's explanations on that site are pretty comprehensive and easy to follow.
 KalamariKing: Ok thanks
 KalamariKing: I'm still quite new to some of these challenges&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Everyone was at some point&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: Are there leaderboards for coc
 Astrobytes: Yep.

 Westicles: I've been beta testing the contest, very tricky
 eulerscheZahl: i bet against
 Astrobytes: He lies.
 eulerscheZahl: (the beta-testing part, not the tricky one)
 Westicles: hex grid, you buy acorns to capture grid spaces.  global warming cards to counter
 Astrobytes: I gotta say though, your daily variants have been rather good&#160;:)
 Westicles: oh, they are telling me not to talk about it. disregard
 eulerscheZahl: just climb the damn hex tree and reach the center
 jacek: hex eh?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/tsukammo/status/1377627181506048013">https://twitter.com/tsukammo/status/1377627181506048013</a>
 Westicles: Actually, the real surprise is they pulled in some schedules and it is an escape room!
 Astrobytes: I know for a fact that the contest is a game.
 eulerscheZahl: see the tree from top, then it's a hey board
 Astrobytes: A hey board eh
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: your what?
 jacek: yes
 eulerscheZahl: your tilt?
 Westicles: Ah, the old My Neighbor Totoro: Aruite Sagaso Totoro`s Dondoko Game (2019)

 eulerscheZahl: "old", "2019"don't make be feel old again
 Illedan: jacek, how big is your network for Oware?
 jacek: 1 hidden layer of 48 units
 Illedan: That's it?
 Astrobytes: Wow jacek, a relevant anime clip
 jacek: of course theres input and output layer :v
 Illedan: Yeye :P
 jacek: but yeah, from NN point its pretty small
 Illedan: My 96x2 is failing vs the one without any hidden layer
 jacek: and 820 possible inputs
 Illedan: 820?
 Illedan: 1 for every amount of beads?
 eulerscheZahl: beads? :bed:
 Illedan: Oware beads
 jacek: 12 houses 0..31, * 2 for the side to move, then 2 * 0..25 for the scores
 Astrobytes: *seeds
 eulerscheZahl: grains
 Illedan: hmmm
 Illedan: thx
 jacek: that gives about 40k weights in my NN
 Illedan: I have 14 inputs :D
 jacek: as you can see, every state has exactly 14 activated 'ones', the rest being zero
 jacek: one-hot inputs
 Illedan: Makes sense
 jacek: though the score inputs could be made into scaled [0-1]
 Marchete: ahh, you have single inputs
 Marchete: one-hot or whatever
 Marchete: that's one thing I hate on NN
 Marchete: it seems so clunky
 Marchete: having normalized isn't good?
 Marchete: asking for a friend
 KalamariKing: It's not bad, but the network can't be unsure
 KalamariKing: If its not precise enough, it will give wrong answers
 KalamariKing: Whereas with one-hot, it can be anywhere from 0.00001 to 0.9999 as long as its higher than the other values, giving more accurate answers
 BlaiseEbuth: Hello there.
 Astrobytes: hii
 jacek: Marchete i could probably get away with normalized input for the scores. as for the houses, 0 seed house or 1 seed house is much different from 5 seed house
 KalamariKing: e.x. 10 outputs -- a difference of 0.1 would become wrong for normalization, but not one-hot, if that makes more sense
 Marchete: one hot is for separating independent data that doesn't fit into a gradient
 jacek: so i treat it differently, like different 'chess piece'
 Marchete: but I thought seed count was some kind of gradient
 Illedan: I guess the exact amount is too important
 jacek: in scores. in houses no.
 jacek: maybe for 3+ seeds in house
 Illedan: Is 31 the max amount of seeds on 1 house?
 Marchete: then when you have a grid game the one-hot will explode
 Marchete: that's not scalable at all
 Illedan: This is where CNN comes to play :P
 jacek: no but i assumed that. any &lt;31 will be 31, its very rare
 Marchete: CNN is slow af
 KalamariKing: Not always
 KalamariKing: Some cnn's can be pretty fast
 jacek: Marchete yeah its not scalable, but sufficient for most of my purposes
 Marchete: CNN compared to MLP is slow af*
 eulerscheZahl: like this CNN? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CNN">https://www.youtube.com/user/CNN</a>
 RoboStac: I just pass raw seed numbers into mine and it works pretty well
 jacek: needs more friendshipp
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: RoboStac, I'm interested in your POV :D
 Illedan: :D
 Marchete: because you have a more Alphazero like
 jacek: you pass not normalized 10, 20?
 Marchete: so passing raw numbers?
 RoboStac: yeah, 14x floats that are the exact values in each house / score
 Marchete: it seems weird
 jacek: and its MLP?
 Marchete: then you have some layers and a policy and value?
 KalamariKing: Also; for hexagons, do you all prefer a 2d grid with shifted rows or a 3-axis representation? Which is easier to program and which is easier to conceptualize, would you say?
 KalamariKing: jacek multilayer perceptron
 RoboStac: 3x dense layers of 96 node and then 6 policy outputs / 1 value
 Marchete: so all is shared until the last dense
 Josephtulaferme: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/servlet/urlinvite?u=3667471">https://www.codingame.com/servlet/urlinvite?u=3667471</a>
 jacek: see? and i need only 1 dense layer&#160;:*
 KalamariKing: Marchete what's the difference between cnn and mlp then? They look rather similar to me
 Marchete: CNN predict/inference takes more computation time
 eulerscheZahl: an invite code to join codingame? shared on a chat that's only accessible when you already have an account? great plan Josephtulaferme
 jacek: CNN treats input as image and has image manipulation stuff
 KalamariKing: eulerscheZahl just gonna say that
 RoboStac: I'm not sure if I've tried less layers
 KalamariKing: jacek But what about cnns and mlps with other classification problems?
 RoboStac: I tried adding one and it didn't help
 Marchete: 3x96 seem a lot of nodes
 Marchete: I don't think I can fit all
 jacek: could be because i have somewhat filtered input
 RoboStac: it's only 21032 floats - can probably fit even if they were full 32 bit weights
 Marchete: 80KB, maybe with some zip help
 Marchete: yes
 antis: hi
 jacek: i can fit ~14bit float into 1 character
 Marchete: no you can't
 jacek: so i can fit 70k-80k weights
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: yes
 RoboStac: yeah, thats what I do too for the bigger ones - my oware is still 16bit floats in 1/2chars
 Marchete: you are talking when sending
 Marchete: ok
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f597f9b-6a2b-497d-82ad-c28323d0e8c0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f597f9b-6a2b-497d-82ad-c28323d0e8c0</a>
 Marchete: I have it prepared <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Codingame/tree/master/BinarySend">https://github.com/marchete/Codingame/tree/master/BinarySend</a>
 Marchete: but I went for the binary+model-&gt;Zip-&gt;Compress
 RoboStac: I don't send a binary either, only the weights get converted
 Marchete: it's probably better on your way
 jacek: RoboStac no input for side to move?
 RoboStac: no, it's always passed in with the first 7 values as the current player
 jacek: ah, rotation/mirroring
 PatrickMcGinnisII: May the 4th be with you
 Marchete: training policy and value at the same time is like in Alphazero? What's the best kind of optimizer?
 Marchete: because that's a bit blur to me 
 RoboStac: I've tried RMSProp and Adam and not found any noticeable difference
 Marchete: I think I'd get scores and policy train values from endgame + visits or smth like that
 Marchete: but the learning rate and these kind of values are a bit confusing, I can't see what is good
 RoboStac: every turn during training it stores the visit counts per node for policy and then at the end backprops the game result for value
 Marchete: sorry Illedan I kidnapped your question, please continue
 Marchete: yeah I had some of your chats saved somewhere
 Marchete: from last year&#160;:)
 jacek: what question
 Marchete: I imagine Ille will ask more things
 Illedan: No problem good reads. Continue discussing details. Just paste all code too. No worries. I have to pack and go anyway
 Marchete: but the one-hot approach was suprising to me and I interrupted him
 jacek: oh
 KalamariKing: Anyone been asked if they were a robot after clicking Submit?
 jacek: too much clashes eh
 KalamariKing: Oh I've been playing a lot
 KalamariKing: I went to onboarding and started messing around with languages I've never used, and well the C's are all similar so I got them all correct first try lol
 KalamariKing: It didn't like that
 ZarthaxX: system just doesnt like you to click submit many times in a short period of time
 ZarthaxX: :P
 KalamariKing: Probably
 ZarthaxX: it works like that
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 KalamariKing: I'm learning that most programming languages are similar
 ZarthaxX: well they serve the same prupose
 KalamariKing: True
 ZarthaxX: but you are using imperative ones
 ZarthaxX: if you try functional it will be different
 ZarthaxX: or OOP
 KalamariKing: Wdym?
 ZarthaxX: like true OOP lol
 ZarthaxX: just learn haskell
 ZarthaxX: you will see
 KalamariKing: Challenge accepted
 Astrobytes: You'll love it
 ZarthaxX: ironic?
 Astrobytes: Perhaps. But it is pretty cool. I'm no expert but I find it quite elegant.
 ZarthaxX: i like it too

 KalamariKing: Howdy, Camden272
 eulerscheZahl: going by the error message he just tried to insert the same entry twice
 BlaiseEbuth: Srlsy who banned KitKat&#160;? She's crying now.&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: not me. i missed that opportunity unfortunately
 TheBatMan_TM: what is it euler?
 BlaiseEbuth: Same...&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: name = db.Column(db.String(10), primary_key=1)
 TheBatMan_TM: maybe i should recreate the db? @eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: that primary thing makes your name a unique key
 eulerscheZahl: if you try to enter two values with the same value, you'll get an error
 TheBatMan_TM: ok, but when i entered it the first time too i got the same error
 eulerscheZahl: (caution, i'm partially guessing, I know some other frameworks like DJango and the Entity Framework but not flask)
 TheBatMan_TM: maybe i should recreate the db?
 eulerscheZahl: you connect to an existing DB
 TheBatMan_TM: ohk they r similar ig
 eulerscheZahl: you might already have that entry from before
 TheBatMan_TM: yeah, so lemme delete and recreate the db and see
 eulerscheZahl: as we are talking about databases:
 eulerscheZahl: Hi,
 TheBatMan_TM: what?
 eulerscheZahl: heroku threatens to turn my puzzle search off for the rest of a month if the uptime further increases

 struct:&#160;:(
 TheBatMan_TM: hey @eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: yes, hi to me&#160;:)
 TheBatMan_TM: the get() is malfunctioning now
 eulerscheZahl: of course, you deleted that entry :D
 eulerscheZahl: or even the whole table
 TheBatMan_TM: i am getting this {'name': None, 'level': 0, 'region': None}
 TheBatMan_TM: no i recreated the table, and the put worked
 eulerscheZahl: open the database with an SQL editor
 eulerscheZahl: (or how do we call those programs)
 TheBatMan_TM: but after "putting" it, i tried to get the same, but it doesn't work
 eulerscheZahl: check with an external tool if it's correctly entered in the database
 TheBatMan_TM: like i put in this {'level':43,'region':'India'},and i got back (as expected) {'name': 'KDawg@1', 'level': 43, 'region': 'India'}
 TheBatMan_TM: but when i tried this requests.get('<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/name/KDawg@1&#39;">http://127.0.0.1:5000/name/KDawg@1'</a>) it returns {'name': None, 'level': 0, 'region': None}

 KalamariKing: What happens if you try to get a non-existent entry
 [0_o]Surya: hello
 KalamariKing: Howdy
 TheBatMan_TM: no that's what i am saying, i literally accessed (get) the data i just put
 [0_o]Surya: is anyone playing ghost in the cell?
 KalamariKing: Right, but what happens if you try to get non-existent data
 TheBatMan_TM: i think we get back a serializable object with null columns
 KalamariKing: So the data being returned is NOT the same as null data? Or it is?
 BlaiseEbuth: About 5153 persons [0_o]Surya
 eulerscheZahl: or their ghosts spooking on the server
 eulerscheZahl: oh, my ghost dropped a rank. who's that nierin guy?
 TheBatMan_TM: I think we r supposed to get this when we access non-existent data (and this is what i am getting too) {'name': None, 'level': 0, 'region': None} @KalamariKing
 TheBatMan_TM: @eulerscheZahl help me bro
 eulerscheZahl: i told you to access the database with a tool outside of your application just to make sure the entry exists in the database as expected
 eulerscheZahl: helps to limit the possibilities where it goes wrong
 [0_o]Surya: @BlaiseEbuth  actually I have a doubt at wood 2 but idk where to ask
 eulerscheZahl: here [0_o]Surya
 BlaiseEbuth: Just with good questions

 TheBatMan_TM: @eulerscheZahl do i have to install the sql setup in pc to do that?
 KalamariKing: Where is the data hosted
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your database
 KalamariKing: A file I presume?
 eulerscheZahl: sqlite =&gt; get sqliteman or something like that
 TheBatMan_TM: i am using flask_sqlalchemy
 eulerscheZahl: app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///database.db'
 KalamariKing: Where does sqlalchemy store to
 TheBatMan_TM: yeah a .db file @KalamariKing
 eulerscheZahl: hmm, i don't know what that is :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh, db file
 eulerscheZahl: great
 KalamariKing: So use an external viewer on the file
 eulerscheZahl: windows or linux?
 TheBatMan_TM: i am running it on repl.it, as i told u i am just experimenting and learning something new
 eulerscheZahl: (sorry, I joined late)
 TheBatMan_TM: @KalamariKing  I am not sure i know how to do that ;p
 KalamariKing: eulerscheZahl is it ok to ask to send the repl? I know some communities don't like that
 eulerscheZahl: there are command line tools to read the data too. i just don't know how to use them from the top of my head
 KalamariKing: If so, TheBatMan_TM send the repl link
 TheBatMan_TM: @KalamariKing  ok bro 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a problem with the link
 KalamariKing: Ok thanks euler
 TheBatMan_TM: @eulerscheZahl which link bro?
 eulerscheZahl: repl
 TheBatMan_TM: oh
 TheBatMan_TM: @KalamariKing KalamariKing

 eulerscheZahl: now I have to find trucks to see you code
 eulerscheZahl: and you can tab-complete the names
 eulerscheZahl: kal[tab] =&gt; KalamariKing
 TheBatMan_TM: i am new here idk
 TheBatMan_TM: I am a hackerrank and codeforces guy, I am kinda new here :upside_down:

 TheBatMan_TM: ok @KalamariKing , and @eulerscheZahl :disappointed:
 TobiasA: i finally completed there is no spoons after 5 months of procrastination
 KalamariKing: lmao same
 eulerscheZahl: now on to "There is no Spoon 2"
 BlaiseEbuth: Can you share a replay [0_o]Surya
 TheBatMan_TM: @KalamariKing  I know, i haven't edited that part out yet, anyways that doesn't have anything to do with the get query
 KalamariKing: TheBatMan_TM try adding a bunch of print statements everywhere, in like every function, with func name and passed data
 KalamariKing: See where the data goes and at what point it gets nulled
 TheBatMan_TM: that doesn't work too
 eulerscheZahl: [0_o]Surya try without the semicolon at the end
 KalamariKing: Oh does flask not allow prints?

 amartya9: hello all&#160;!
 KalamariKing: Helo amartya9
 BlaiseEbuth: You've don the easy one, there's the true one now :3
 TheBatMan_TM: @KalamariKing, how do i do it without using @?
 eulerscheZahl: [0_o]Surya don't listen to BlaiseEbuth and just remove the trailing semicolon
 TobiasA: bruuuuuuuuuuuh
 TobiasA: i can't do that
 KalamariKing: same
 KalamariKing: I can't even do those without code
 TobiasA: just pretend that one doesn't exist and praise me for my good deed
 BlaiseEbuth: What don't listen to me? I did'nt say anything
 TheBatMan_TM: @KalamariKing , any other suggestions?
 [0_o]Surya: @eulerscheZahlAfter removing semicolon:invalid input. Expected 'A valid action' but found 'MOVE 1 2 1MOVE 1 3 10MOVE 1 4 10MOVE 1 5 5MOVE 1 6 1MOVE 1 0 1'
 TheBatMan_TM: I have to virtually see the table ig
 BlaiseEbuth: He said "the trailing semicolon"
 BlaiseEbuth: Not all
 eulerscheZahl: you were supposed to remove the last one
 eulerscheZahl: or add a WAIT at the end
 TheBatMan_TM: but how do i do that online? as i have saved it in a file
 KalamariKing: TheBatMan_TM same as normal, without the @ sign, pretty ez
 TobiasA: now my next mission is to win one more fastest mode in coc to get 50 xp
 TheBatMan_TM: ok just KalamariKing  then?

 KalamariKing: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and you want to select * instead of "blah"
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 KalamariKing: That
 TheBatMan_TM: KalamariKing , but that's for sqlite right?
 KalamariKing: Yeah, run apt-get install sqlite in the repl shell and then continue with that answer (still in repl shell)
 [0_o]Surya: @BlaiseEbuth,@eulerscheZahl It worked than you
 gigolo: lol for a clash there is only 4 numbers in that range are becomes true i could use that in shortest&#160;:\
 KalamariKing: Wdym
 gigolo: perfect numbers

 KalamariKing: I spent so long on that
 eulerscheZahl: you only need 6=perfect
 eulerscheZahl: rest isn't covered by validators
 KalamariKing:&#160;:'(
 gigolo:&#160;:\
 TheBatMan_TM: KalamariKing something like this? python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.connect('database.db').cursor().execute('SELECT * FROM SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI ').fetchall())"
 eulerscheZahl: SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URIi don't think that that's your table name
 KalamariKing: TheBatMan_TM there should be a shell tab. It's literally just a bash shell, for the repl virtual machine. Type sudo apt-get install sqlite3
 KalamariKing: And then run sqlite [name].db
 TheBatMan_TM: no i got it this works:
 KalamariKing: And then you can simply type in the 'SELECT * FROM ... ' stuff straight into the shell
 TheBatMan_TM: python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.connect('database.db').cursor().execute('SELECT * FROM name_search_model').fetchall())"
 TheBatMan_TM: ok KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: I mean, it will work, but I find it easier to work straight from shell
 TheBatMan_TM: KalamariKing, it shows that the record is inserted but still the get doesn't work why?
 KalamariKing: Could be something with the keyword, idk
 KalamariKing: Does a different library work on the database?
 TheBatMan_TM: idk
 TheBatMan_TM: it SHOULD work, but idk y it isn't

 Westicles: Advertising on boxes of pop tarts really payed off for CG
 KalamariKing: Wait did they really
 BlaiseEbuth: baby diapers are next
 KalamariKing: Btdubs is it faster to use sqrt or fractional exponents
 Hjax: man reading old code you wrote 
 Hjax: makes you question your sanity 
 KalamariKing: ikr? recently redid onboarding in a different language... seeing the old code was rough
 Hjax: the question is was i insane before, or am i insane now 
 BlaiseEbuth: Why not both?
 Hjax: its entirely possible
 KalamariKing: Hjax you're more insane, faster

 Digginwings: thank u
 KalamariKing: I've neber written a game, so you got one on me&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: never*
 Digginwings: i made another game but need to debug it
 KalamariKing: oh lol
 KalamariKing: debugging sucks, always
 Matronx: nice game, you need to start organizing your repository
 KalamariKing: Anyone know Python here?
 Philbot: are there any good articles on MCTS applied in multiplayer games&#160;?
 VizGhar: jeez... you haven't learned you have to ask right away KalamariKing?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>i always have (3) crossed out
 Hjax: i do 
 eulerscheZahl: i still need (4) for my bingo
 Hjax: back in the day the #python channel on the freenode server had the description "Don't ask to ask"
 Hjax: meaning, dont go "hey can i ask a question" just say your question 
 KalamariKing: Well this is main and idk if you all write strictly F#
 KalamariKing: However
 eulerscheZahl: we just flood with channel with whatever comes to our mind
 Philbot: figures
 eulerscheZahl: i know that I wrote this wrong
 KalamariKing: *our* mind
 KalamariKing: collective hive mind
 Hjax: we are the borg
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Philbot: sorry for pressuring you
 Astrobytes: Who asked about MCTS for multiplayer?
 VizGhar: KalamariKing 14 mesages  and you still didn't ask&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: Philbot idek what those are sorry
 eulerscheZahl: 50...sentences...laaateeerrrrr.....
 eulerscheZahl: we can still get there
 TobiasA: what is MCTS?
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo tree search
 Philbot: i asked about MCTS
 KalamariKing: VizGhar yes however I don't know how to ask... it's kind of a 'why doesnt this work' and that's not a good question
 davilla: monte carlo tree search
 KalamariKing: Philbot yeah mcts, I haven't heard of it until now, sorry
 TobiasA: when is the contest?
 VizGhar:  Not without context&#160;:)
 Hjax: contest is in 2 days 
 eulerscheZahl: the idea is that you play a random game. and then learn from it to understand that some moves are more likely to lead to a win than others
 TobiasA: woah woah woah
 Philbot: i didn't ask anyone specifically kalamari
 TobiasA: and i am still a noob
 Astrobytes: Turn-based or simultaneous philRG?
 Astrobytes: *Philbot
 eulerscheZahl: we are getting close to the contest, tabbing is getting less effective again
 Philbot: any either all, want to know how it's usually being applied
 TobiasA: what is tabbing?
 Philbot: searching single tree is easy but how do you merge the two trees
 Astrobytes: Well for simultaneous you can look into Smitsimax/UCT Forest
 eulerscheZahl: eul[tab] =&gt; eulerscheZahl (auto completion)
 Hjax: im using MCTS for othello
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS for connect 4 in C#<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg">https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg</a>
 TobiasA: oouuuu that awesome feature
 Hjax: although my own code is currently confusing me 
 TobiasA: i found out about it yesterday
 Hjax: if you have specific questions about my MCTS othello program, feel free to shoot me a pm @Philbot
 VizGhar: Philbot it's not about 2 or more trees. Simplest (but not right version) is to randomly search one tree again and again until you say. Yup this next move leads to most wins
 KalamariKing: Btw how does the pastebin/codingame thing work when people post code
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;= 5 lines turns into a pastebin
 Hjax: what i really want to know is why constraining my eval to juts the discrete values [0, 0.5, 1] makes it play better than a continuous eval 
 eulerscheZahl: and a certain number of characters (I forgot the limit) does the same
 KalamariKing: oh sick
 Astrobytes: You can store a reward vector for n players I guess, like maxN
 eulerscheZahl: and then there is ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 jacek: oh my
 Astrobytes: But then I haven't done &gt; 2 player MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: never gets old
 KalamariKing: Could someone look over my distance formula I think its right but idk
 Astrobytes: Vandalism!
 VizGhar: my chat is falling apart
 eulerscheZahl: just share the formula and find out if we can
 KalamariKing: eulerscheZahl this is pure beauty and i forgot I had to paste it lol

 Marchete: do you use MCTS on some games, euler?
 KalamariKing: I'm in class and my attention is very divided, if I forget something that's why, sorry
 eulerscheZahl: do you convert between degree and radians?
 eulerscheZahl: yes Marchete
 eulerscheZahl: UTTT and Bandas
 KalamariKing: Does it need to be?
 jacek: btw. chat didnt break for me
 VizGhar: and 2048&#160;:)
 philRG: Astrobytes philBot and philRG belongs to 2 different indviduals
 eulerscheZahl: not sure anymore if I have another one in the arena
 eulerscheZahl: 2048 is beam search
 jacek: not in onitama?
 VizGhar: ah sure... my bad
 KalamariKing: As long as its all using the same units (rad or deg) then does it matter?
 eulerscheZahl: minimax
 VizGhar: onitama is minimax
 jacek: right...
 jacek: if you say so
 Astrobytes: Yes, I just answered your message PhilRG, sorry for the ping&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :rolling_eyes:
 KalamariKing: Wait why do I have to use the given formula for distance
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators</a>
 KalamariKing: Couldn't I just use Pythag th
 philRG: Astrobytes no problem&#160;:-)
 KalamariKing: eulerscheZahl that's the one I'm doing rn
 eulerscheZahl: and it asks you to find the distance
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 KalamariKing: I used the given formula
 KalamariKing: Something isn't working and that's what I think it is
 eulerscheZahl: and I told you to check if you use radians
 Smelty: hmmrm
 eulerscheZahl: as you are given coordinates in degrees
 KalamariKing: Yeah its using rads
 KalamariKing: OH
 KalamariKing: ok thanks, I'm blaming this on trig being next year's class
 VizGhar: I think some guys said, you can solve this without that complicated formula?
 KalamariKing: VizGhar imma try pythag and see if it works
 eulerscheZahl: there are different formulas for distances
 VizGhar: just sqrt(dxˆ2+dyˆ2) not sure though
 eulerscheZahl: different approximations
 KalamariKing: VizGhar ye thats the one
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds off to me. you can get lucky with the testcases
 eulerscheZahl: the points are close together, making it almost a flat surface
 eulerscheZahl: and the earth isn't even a perfect sphere (which most formulas assume)
 eulerscheZahl: more like a rotated ellipse
 VizGhar: anyway... you code seems to be correct. U sure the problem is in this part of code?
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/NetMokka">https://github.com/marchete/NetMokka</a>
 Marchete: I was able to do all AVX2 stuff on C#
 Marchete: and it goes as fast as C++
 eulerscheZahl: oh cool. thanks for sharing Marchete
 eulerscheZahl: even if i don't want to use the NN part, I can still use it as a reference for AVX
 Philbot: you have a C++ version too?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: defib.... i tried my code without multiplying the distance by 6371 and the precision caused it to fail.  depends on lang., i actually did this one in java so i wouldn't have to fight precision
 VizGhar: hmm I used kotlin, so it's same as Patrick's
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see how the 6371 could change anything. are you converting to integers or something?
 KalamariKing: I'm back
 KalamariKing: The 6371 is the radius of the earth, in km
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i originally used php euler ... the rounding error without using bcmath
 KalamariKing: I'm saying screw that and trying pythag
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Double';s are fine
 KalamariKing: Are you looking at my code
 KalamariKing: Wait no nv,
 KalamariKing: nvm*
 KalamariKing: can you not raise a float to a power
 KalamariKing: oh wait python uses **
 KalamariKing: nvm
 VizGhar: There was a calendar of events for fall challenge. I mean. when will silver/gold/legend leagues opened
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: fionally, that's #4
 eulerscheZahl: BINGO!!!
 KalamariKing: oh lmao
 VizGhar: is there calendar for this event?
 VizGhar: euler the one was for me? :D
 eulerscheZahl: no, for the python power
 eulerscheZahl: league opening is always monday, wednesday, friday
 VizGhar: ah thanks god I already felt ashamed
 eulerscheZahl: 6pm UTC+2
 VizGhar: tnx
 Philbot: hard to follow with chat
 King_Coda: hello
 Philbot: at one point i thought we're not supposed to ask questions
 King_Coda: good morning
 davilla: I'm coding a very hard puzzle, watching a movie, changing a flat tire, and giving a presentation on slot machines all at the same time, so sorry if my thoughts are a little scattered. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
 King_Coda: who the hell is Phoenix09 and why are they following me
 eulerscheZahl: i prefer a series over a movie. i'm bad at remembering faces&#160;:(
 King_Coda: well they're banned now, so it doesnt really matter
 eulerscheZahl: easier for me when i get some episodes to get used to them
 davilla: funny, I have the same problem in real life... but actors usually have very distinct features
 davilla: when they don't, I get super confused
 eulerscheZahl: remembering shoes can help. easier with men usually, they don't wear a different pair every day :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My GF remembers people's pet's names and references people by "...watzerface with Binky, Fuzzy, or whatever "
 davilla: The Departed was super confusing, for instance
 orangesnowfox: good morning peoples
 eulerscheZahl: good evening to you as well
 Philbot: it is said first thing women look at are your shoes perhaps that's how they remember me
 davilla: and some other movie I saw as a teen, set somewhere it snows, that had 3 blonds
 eulerscheZahl: nowadays it's my initials in the teams meeting
 eulerscheZahl: which they see first
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't put a profile pic there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have multiple pairs of Tevas, women know if your wearing your good pair or your work pair
 Astrobytes: DM's all the way
 eulerscheZahl: none for me
 davilla: the difference between an introverted mathematician and and extroverted mathematician, is that an introverted mathematician looks at his shoes when he talks to you
 davilla: an extroverted mathematician looks at your shoes
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 eulerscheZahl: i knew that one already
 Westicles: I was surprised when I started working, all the guys were wearing shorts with their balls hanging out
 eulerscheZahl: working at a ball park?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gotta keep 'em dry
 Westicles: That's why I never found the movie The Matrix realistic.  Having to be on time and wear a suit for a programmer?
 davilla: a noob here for the first time might see the name Westicles and the topic of conversation and be very confused what this is all about
 TobiasA: how come i can't output an angle for the pod to turn in coders strike back
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I see chat is having an 'eclectic' day
 Smelty: yes.
 davilla: it's excitement about the upcoming event
 davilla: that people aren't addressing directly
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Smelty: TobiasA: Just output the place you want it to go and the thrust, it will automatically turn a maximum of 18 degrees in each direction to point at the place you want it to go
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and here i am trying to bitblt smash the code to squeeze more iterations
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i give up, glhf
 davilla: bitblt =&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bit twiddling
 davilla: oh there's a pedia on it
 Philbot: is there something i should not use bitboards for?
 eulerscheZahl: readable code
 Marchete: sanity
 Philbot: are there any particular contests where bitboards don't work
 Astrobytes: Anything without a board, generally speaking&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: But you can still use bitwise ops, packing stuff etc
 Philbot: but any values can be encoded as bits
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 Manchi_o6o7: how can I compare two strings in C, alphabetically. So I can bianry search  a word
 eulerscheZahl: if you are happy with reaching legend and don't plan to win the contest, you won't need bitboards
 eulerscheZahl: str_cmp as "asciibetical"
 eulerscheZahl: you can toupper it and then compare that way
 Manchi_o6o7: str1&gt;str2 won't work*
 Manchi_o6o7:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/library-function/string.h/strcmp">https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/library-function/string.h/strcmp</a>
 eulerscheZahl: note that this function is case sensitive
 Manchi_o6o7: I need to determine the high and low in a binary search
 Manchi_o6o7: I have an array of strings alphabetically sorted, and the key string
 Westicles: Heh heh. "Haskell is already supported".  I don't know anything about that guy to tell if that is straight up or not
 KalamariKing: Westicles is haskell support poor?
 KalamariKing: And I've heard the term bitboard a few times now, what does it mean
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6f7d577-0a56-4458-97ae-3e67e7ea2984">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6f7d577-0a56-4458-97ae-3e67e7ea2984</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: binary search isn't working&#160;:(
 KalamariKing: strcmp takes two strings
 KalamariKing: wait i didn't see the ,
 Philbot: there is a free book for haskell kalamarihttp://learnyouahaskell.com/
 KalamariKing: I was just questioning westicles' statement
 Hjax: @KalamariKing imagine a game of checkers, on a 8x8 board
 Hjax: you can use 1 64 bit integer for each color
 Westicles: The version seems to be 3 years old.  I'm sure they've added lots of stuff to make it even more incomprehensible in that time
 Hjax: each bit of the integer represents one square of the board 
 KalamariKing: Oh that's cool
 Hjax: 1 = theres a piece there, 0 = theres no piece there 
 Hjax: it lets you represent a game state in a very compact way, do efficient move generation, 
 struct: VS does not compile on debug but compiles on release 
 Hjax: if you are after performance, bitboards are often the answer 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Manchi_o6o7: struct, can you help me out with my code
 KalamariKing: istg this actually sucks
 KalamariKing: I cannot for the life of me do this and idk why
 struct: sorry im solving some problems atm
 nikcode: hello
 KalamariKing: Hello nikcode!
 KalamariKing: struct what kinda problems?
 nikcode: wassup guys - too much reading in problems
 KalamariKing: wdym
 Philbot: nikcode are you reading the same article as me?
 nikcode: not sure 
 Philbot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 Philbot: best first, minimax and uct
 nikcode: I just joined this today and trying just for understanding - what it is 
 Philbot: first paragraph talks about NN too
 KalamariKing: What what is
 nikcode: How does it work and improve coding - can anyone explain/
 KalamariKing: How does WHAT improve coding
 nikcode: I mean how to use for better result
 KalamariKing: how to use WHAT
 Philbot: i am still reading it nikcode
 nikcode: ok
 Westicles: Philbot, maybe try this?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise</a>
 Philbot: not now
 Philbot: besides i am looking through ideas
 KalamariKing: oh my god
 KalamariKing: this whole time
 KalamariKing: the lat and lon were switches
 KalamariKing: switched*
 KalamariKing: whoever made this puzzle don't know their coordinate systems
 Philbot: i don't understand the article at all
 Philbot: if they can evaluate best move at depth 0 what is the role of the tree?
 KalamariKing: Maybe the best move changes based on what the opponent does?
 KalamariKing: Idk
 Philbot: is there a way to block people in this chat?
 KalamariKing: Idts
 KalamariKing: Not in main, only admin can do that, but maybe in dms? You'd have to talk to struct or BlaiseEbuth or smn
 Astrobytes: Is someone bothering you Philbot? Like in DM or something?
 KalamariKing: Astro is also a mod, yeah
 eulerscheZahl: so many mods :scream:
 KalamariKing: Indeed
 KalamariKing: What purpose have you of 10 active mods
 Marchete: fame and girls
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Not usually all active at the same time
 Astrobytes: Different time zones too
 eulerscheZahl: we still have a problem during European night time
 eulerscheZahl: mods are very centered
 KalamariKing: What time is it in europe rn btw
 Astrobytes: Hm, we only have re Curse overnight really
 eulerscheZahl: 8:42pm
 Astrobytes: 7:42pm
 KalamariKing: That's so weird to think about, idk why
 KalamariKing: Some people are waking up when others are going to sleep
 eulerscheZahl: and some are below you without falling down
 Westicles: Yeah, MK is about the only one who sometimes takes a night shift
 eulerscheZahl: is he mod again?
 eulerscheZahl: chat server crashed and mod permissions got a bit shuffled
 KalamariKing: :o
 Astrobytes: Yes, I think he's still mod eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: or again? not sure
 Astrobytes: Again yeah.
 Hjax: every time ive come here at night for me, theres just been a massive wall of spam :joy:
 Astrobytes: Message removal capability would be an enormous help, but it's not going to happen.
 Astrobytes: Ignore functionality, etc
 Marchete:  /ignore all
 Astrobytes: that's just ?disableChat :P
 KalamariKing: How do you re enable I wanna try this out
 struct: Im only allowed 1 ban per week
 Astrobytes: On a diet?
 Astrobytes: Re-enable what Ruler of Fried Squid?
 jacek: huh
 King_Coda: ?disableChat
 King_Coda: ?disableChat
 Astrobytes: No you add that to the URL
 jacek: alt+F4
 KalamariKing: Oh hey again King_Coda
 King_Coda: ?fortheloveofgodpleasedisableChat
 struct: I add that to the special ide
 Astrobytes: chat commands are prefixed with /
 King_Coda: wait i want to try this
 KalamariKing: What chat commands are there
 Astrobytes: Click that question mark
 King_Coda: holy crap that works
 KalamariKing: Oh lol
 KalamariKing: can you not pm yourself
 Astrobytes: ...
 KalamariKing: I need this astro
 King_Coda: wait let me look at the source code for the site real quick
 King_Coda: god dammit CG, why didn't you clean up your code
 King_Coda: how the hell am I supposed to find my post ID in this mess?
 eulerscheZahl: because they use Angular
 eulerscheZahl: analyze the network traffic
 eulerscheZahl: source code is unreadable and the same on every page
 King_Coda: ugh
 King_Coda: i need my post key
 KalamariKing: why
 King_Coda: oh wait
 struct: This scroll bug
 struct: Every time
 King_Coda: oh yeah I hate that
 King_Coda: I found my profile ID
 Astrobytes: It's been getting worse recently that scroll issue struct
 King_Coda: <i>{"level":53,"xpThreshold":3858,"cumulativeXp":83701}"</i>
 King_Coda: found where they keep the level data
 KalamariKing: epic
 KalamariKing: but now what
 King_Coda: "chatChannels":{"privateConversations"
 King_Coda: that's where they keep pm's
 Marchete: hackerman
 King_Coda: "channels":["world@conference.codingame.com"]
 King_Coda: that's the public channel
 King_Coda: there are only 9 lines of code, the lines are just super long for some reason
 King_Coda: you can find all of this stuff at the bottom of line 1
 Astrobytes: ooh it's 1337 h4x0r time again Marchete
 King_Coda: "impersonated":false}
 King_Coda: they have a line of code that checks if the user is impersonating another user
 KalamariKing: wait can admin do that
 KalamariKing: can MODS do that
 KalamariKing: astro are you astro
 King_Coda: it's just a boolean i think
 King_Coda: {If user IP matches user ID then "impersonated":false}
 Hjax: im actually astro
 Hjax: see look, cat profile picture 
 King_Coda: or something like that
 King_Coda: i don't know if they match ip's or if they check impersonation some other way
 Astrobytes: Brain wave patterns.
 King_Coda: lol
 Hjax: maybe its code analysis
 Hjax: this guys code is trash, must be hjax
 Astrobytes: You mean me
 Astrobytes: You're astro
 Hjax: ah right, im astro
 Astrobytes: HastroJax
 struct: I cant even read what you typed&#160;:/
 struct: after I typed it fixed
 KalamariKing: struct are you struct
 King_Coda: "chatChannels":{"privateConversations":[{"id":"4279233","nick":"Astrobytes"}]
 Therabidpanther: wtf
 King_Coda: this is my pm with astro
 KalamariKing: spooky
 Astrobytes: Yeah, now do something with that.
 Therabidpanther: how did you get the json from your chat lol
 King_Coda: Ctrl+u
 Therabidpanther: is that a thing for any site? lol
 KalamariKing: nah
 struct: can you stop with the random pings Kalamari?
 KalamariKing: hacks
 KalamariKing: sorry lol
 King_Coda: "4279233", i don't think I can do anything with that
 King_Coda: ctrl+u works with any site
 Astrobytes: 'Inspect' is usually a little more interesting no?
 King_Coda: yeah, but that only...
 King_Coda: OH
 King_Coda: WAIT
 KalamariKing: lmao
 King_Coda: If I can get the chat ID of a different PM, then use inspect, I can change my PM to a different PM
 KalamariKing: wack
 Astrobytes: gl with that
 KalamariKing: wait can you see other pms?
 King_Coda: "channels":["world@conference.codingame.com"
 King_Coda: this is the id for a public channel
 King_Coda: if I can change the id to say...
 King_Coda: ["clash@conference.codingame.com"
 King_Coda: then it should change the world channel to the clash channel
 Therabidpanther: So all channels have email addresses?
 Therabidpanther: time to spam! lol
 King_Coda: I can only see the PM's that are directly linked to my userID
 King_Coda: I can't see the ID's of other users PM's
 Therabidpanther: but if you were to guess the ID, could you eavesdrop? lol
 King_Coda: guessing an id would be difficult
 Therabidpanther: very
 Astrobytes: Scroll to the bottom:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 King_Coda: AHA
 BlaiseEbuth: Warzazat ping?
 King_Coda: 0000000@chat.codingame.com
 King_Coda: I know what the number is, that's the userID
 Therabidpanther: thats your user id? lol
 Astrobytes: Such a 1337 h4x0r
 King_Coda: if i were somehow able to get someone elses userID then could I impersonate them?
 King_Coda: my user id is not 0000000
 Therabidpanther: wanna be me? lol
 King_Coda: no, i think the server would be sus
 King_Coda: remember: "impersonated":false}
 King_Coda: there might be a check that will cuc me
 KalamariKing: More than likely
 King_Coda: i don't want to get cucced
 KalamariKing: What happens if you set that to true btw?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't underestimate the mess that is the chat server config...
 Therabidpanther: im sure the admin password is "password"
 Astrobytes: p455w0rD actually
 King_Coda: if I set that to true i don't think it would do anything
 King_Coda: but i dont want to risk it
 King_Coda: i remember something like this on a different website
 King_Coda: when you made a new account, you couldnt type in chat for 24 hours
 Therabidpanther: how do you plan on changing the value? lol
 KalamariKing: Inspect element
 King_Coda: however, if you got your post id and typed it into a special url, then typed the message you wanted to send and hit enter, it would send the message and ignore the wait
 King_Coda: the site only checked input from the actual chat bar, not from the post key itself
 fvla: that's so funny
 King_Coda: codingame has no post key system, or it does not tell me what my post key is, so I can't do anything with that
 King_Coda: however i can still mess around with chat values and still have some fun
 Astrobytes: As I said. Good luck&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: But what if he finds a hol
 fvla: test
 KalamariKing: hole*
 TobiasA: what are you hacking?
 Therabidpanther: {"isAdmin": true}
 KalamariKing: fvla whatchya testing
 fvla: network response
 Therabidpanther: we need codingame nfts
 Astrobytes: Go go n00b13 1337 h4x0r5
 KalamariKing: I have a question and before you all link the 'how to ask a good question' or whatever I just a hint or something, I've been at this for like two hours
 Astrobytes: Dude: the point is - forget the preamble And Just Ask The Question
 Philbot:&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: im sorryyyyy used to other servers
 KalamariKing: The mayan number puzzle is kicking my butt. I got the numbers working and the equation and all working, but the final piece is putting it all into base-20
 KalamariKing: how does one change bases FROM base 10 TO something else, in python
 Astrobytes: don't make me letmegooglethatforyou
 KalamariKing: int(x, n) converts FROM base n TO base 10, but I need the opposite
 BlaiseEbuth: Language does not matter
 fvla: look up radix change?
 fvla: that's the name of the numeric base: radix
 King_Coda: try int(n, x)
 King_Coda: that's the opposite
 KalamariKing: blaise yeah but if it were javascript. a simple tostring() would do it
 fvla: lmao
 Astrobytes: ...
 BlaiseEbuth: Python is such an assisted language...
 KalamariKing: yeah
 i_dont_want_a_nickname: Is it just me or is the auto complete continuously breaking in the codingame editor right now?  I have refreshed several times.
 KalamariKing: you have to spam escape i_dont_want_a_nickname
 King_Coda: ctrl+w will fix it
 Astrobytes: It does that from time to time, sometimes it's fine (rarely ime)
 KalamariKing: I can't find the python func to do this and idk how to do it mathematically yet
 fvla: KalamariKing I literally just googled "radix change python" and got perfectly sound answers in a matter of half a minute
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah no. Haven't seen the python.
 King_Coda: so the world@conference.codingame.com variable is unchangeable as far as i know
 Astrobytes: Honestly KalamariKing, the purpose of these puzzles is sometimes to learn something that you don't know...
 King_Coda: there is no way to leave world chat sadly
 King_Coda: but yes, you can change all other channel variables
 BlaiseEbuth: I can make you leave if you want
 Astrobytes: That learning doesn't usually constitute asking in chat without even attempting to look it up yourself and making a go of it.
 King_Coda: no thanks blaise
 King_Coda: :innocent:
 KalamariKing: I've looked it up a couple times and it's usually different every time
 Astrobytes: It's not an instant gratification thing, it requires thought and time if you need to learn a different technique
 King_Coda: just try all the different solutions and see which one works
 Astrobytes: ...
 King_Coda: ezpz
 Astrobytes: And learn... nothing.
 King_Coda: No, then you do a bunch of the same puzzles and use the same solution, that way you remember how to do it
 King_Coda: :grinning:
 Astrobytes: Btw, first person who DM's me during the contest asking "how do I solve this" gets a Free Ban.
 King_Coda: OH YEAH
 KalamariKing: me
 KalamariKing: i wanna
 King_Coda: Contest is after tomorrow!
 King_Coda: I just realised this morning that I turn 16 tomorrow
 Hjax: lol astro
 Astrobytes: You want a medal or something King_Coda?
 Hjax: do people dm you more now that youre a mod?
 King_Coda: Yes
 TobiasA: yo Astrobytes
 King_Coda: I want my State ID
 TobiasA: hope you got my back the day after tomorrow
 Astrobytes: TobiasA: Please state the nature of your coding emergency.
 TobiasA: hehehehe
 King_Coda: TobiasA...
 TobiasA: free ban for me
 TobiasA: haha you all have to pay
 King_Coda: No we don't/
 TobiasA: you do
 Astrobytes: Oh no, it rolls over. Don't worry about that.
 King_Coda: What you think: :money_mouth:In reality: :expressionless:
 TobiasA: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: Contest questions go here
 TobiasA: burning burning burning lalalala la la
 King_Coda: I'll clean that up
 TobiasA: where
 TobiasA: wher
 KalamariKing: where
 TobiasA: e
 Astrobytes: here
 King_Coda: ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) 
 TobiasA: me first
 KalamariKing: here?
 KalamariKing: on the table?
 King_Coda: There
 King_Coda: under there
 Astrobytes: In world chat. Do you suddenly have a reduced mental capacity or something?
 TobiasA: question 1
 TobiasA: what is the best method for approaching bot programming
 King_Coda: Approach it politely
 Astrobytes: Leaving chat and opening one.
 TobiasA: i tried it and it didn't work
 King_Coda: Cantankerous: Astrobytes and I
 TobiasA: i also tried approaching it aggresively
 KalamariKing: question 1.499999999if I were to win, would someone else win
 King_Coda: What happened to the braincells of this chat
 TobiasA: there goes my last brain cell
 King_Coda: Did me and Astro take them all
 King_Coda:&#160;?
 KalamariKing: question 1.50000000001if my dog were to somehow pull this off would I reap the reward
 TobiasA: seems like it
 Astrobytes: KalamariKing: give it a rest please
 TobiasA: ooooh King_Coda and Astrobytes want to use our braincells for the contest
 KalamariKing: More serious question what IF someone uses your acc
 KalamariKing: You would win, right? It's your acc at the tip
 KalamariKing: top*
 Astrobytes: If you mean 'getting a smart friend to write your bot for you' - these accounts get sniffed out rather fast
 BlaiseEbuth: תסתום את הפה 
 BlaiseEbuth: Sorry
 King_Coda: BLAISE
 King_Coda: RUDE
 TobiasA: Astrobytes you can borrow my account on the contest day
 BlaiseEbuth: I cuss in Hebrew when I'm angry. Old habits...
 TobiasA: do as you please with it but return it loaded
 King_Coda: How do they figure out which accounts are doing that?
 Westicles: They look for "impersonated":true
 SwagColoredKitteh: tfw qts everywhere
 Astrobytes: hey swaggeh
 SwagColoredKitteh: heyy&#160;!
 SwagColoredKitteh: how are you&#160;?
 King_Coda: Who is this? Another Westicles troll account?
 Astrobytes: Other than having my resolve crushed by the hopelessness of this chat today I am well. You? :D
 SwagColoredKitteh: oh no D: get your resolve back! grab some hot chocolate!
 SwagColoredKitteh: well, surviving, i guess :P
 Astrobytes: Always helpful.Ready for the contest?
 SwagColoredKitteh: no but it does sound fun!
 BlaiseEbuth: Rototo brew!
 SwagColoredKitteh: i will not be here at the start as i have an appointment with my psychologist around that time :P
 SwagColoredKitteh: but i will join in
 Astrobytes: it's 11 days, all good
 Astrobytes: It better not be another potion making malarkey BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: With fow and elastic collisions!
 Astrobytes: Now we're talking.
 King_Coda: Nice rap sheet SwagColoredKitteh. Good jobo getting top 0.2%
 King_Coda: *job
 SwagColoredKitteh: fog of war is always fun
 SwagColoredKitteh: thanks uwu
 King_Coda: eulerscheZahl IS NUMBER 2???
 SwagColoredKitteh: elastic collisions ayooo
 SwagColoredKitteh: b o u n c e
 Astrobytes: boing!
 KiwiTae: omgg SwagColoredKitteh hellooo
 KiwiTae: long time
 King_Coda: Wait, who is number 1??
 KiwiTae: Royale prob
 Astrobytes: Royale probably
 TobiasA: in situations like this i wish i was smart
 King_Coda: _Royale
 Astrobytes: lol Kiwi
 BlaiseEbuth: We are number one.
 King_Coda: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl is there a way to be be number 2
 TobiasA: i don't understand anything that is going on
 Astrobytes: Yes, we try not to tag unnecessarily King_Coda
 King_Coda: Ohhh, sorry :grimacing:
 KalamariKing: TobiasA we're talking about rankings in something, idk what
 King_Coda: Rankings in Codingame
 KalamariKing: Overall?
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes is right King_Coda, don't ping eulerscheZahl like that.
 TobiasA: oh i bet i'm rankless
 King_Coda: i think im 32,000th
 KiwiTae: 13365th for you TobiasA
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth is completely correct in this assertion King_Coda and here you have one too TobiasA
 gigolo: me trying to get top 5000&#160;:)
 King_Coda: PLease stop pinging me Astrobytes
 KinectTheUnknown: We are
 Astrobytes: As you wish
 KiwiTae: gigolo just do the contest or a bot programming and thats it
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes is pinging you King_Coda&#160;?
 gigolo:&#160;:) 
 KalamariKing: lmao
 King_Coda: Yes BlaiseEbuth, he is
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes are you pinging King_Coda&#160;?
 gigolo: :D
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth stop pinging me and King_Coda
 gigolo: lol
 Astrobytes: Right.
 Astrobytes: Enough of that crap.
 SwagColoredKitteh: KiwiTae hey!
 KalamariKing: lmao
 BlaiseEbuth: Do I pinging you and King_Coda Astrobytes&#160;?&#160;:/
 gigolo: :laughing:
 KalamariKing: MOD vs MOD: FIGHT
 King_Coda: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: Wot. We don't fight.
 KalamariKing: anyone wanna pore over my code and help me figure out why some is working and some isnt?
 KiwiTae: sure 
 BlaiseEbuth: It's python?
 KalamariKing: ye
 Astrobytes: Or pythong?
 KiwiTae: Blaise will only help if its clojure
 King_Coda: Just go to SO, they're a real helpful bunch!
 BlaiseEbuth: You have your answer
 KalamariKing: it's probably pretty easy to spot, just not to me
 KiwiTae: KalamariKing gimme if its short 
 Astrobytes: Just post it
 KalamariKing: KiwiTae see there's the issue
 KalamariKing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/37628bcb-bba3-4a5e-bbc1-4aa9d7d0dd5e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/37628bcb-bba3-4a5e-bbc1-4aa9d7d0dd5e</a>
 KalamariKing: There's the full code
 BlaiseEbuth: pleonsam
 KalamariKing: Its the mayan numbers thing
 KalamariKing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mayan-calculation">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mayan-calculation</a>
 Astrobytes: um
 BlaiseEbuth: *pleonasm
 SwagColoredKitteh: pythong sounds great
 SwagColoredKitteh: i am personally a roost programmer
 Westicles: With python I always get some weird error about inconsistent use of tabs and spaces for indenting
 Astrobytes: Yeah Swaggeh, pythong is both underwear for snakes and a very useful language
 KalamariKing: It passes 1-4, 6, and 95, 7-8, and 10-11, something is really wrong and i don't know what&#160;:(
 SwagColoredKitteh: the compiler shouting at me is just mmf
 Astrobytes: Roost :rofl:
 SwagColoredKitteh: i dig that stuff
 King_Coda: What are you talking about Swaggeh, C-- is the best
 King_Coda: C-- is the superior language
 SwagColoredKitteh: i can't borrow this mutably? well watch me, roost
 King_Coda: -the hassle-the fun
 orangesnowfox: is Roost just a weird spelling of Rust? ]
 SwagColoredKitteh: who needs fun when you can fight the compiler all day
 SwagColoredKitteh: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes
 orangesnowfox: Who needs to fight the compiler all day when you could just be good :sunglasses:
 BlaiseEbuth: AskHell is my language
 Astrobytes: Barn-storming borrow checker
 SwagColoredKitteh: i like being good at fighting the compiler
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, but like, why fight the compiler when you could come to a mutual agreement
 orangesnowfox: :p
 SwagColoredKitteh: every time i do a cargo run, the mortal combat theme starts playing
 SwagColoredKitteh: agreement? with rustc? that does not exist
 orangesnowfox: Umm, it does tho
 SwagColoredKitteh: you just agree to disagree
 Astrobytes: Make friends with Ferris
 SwagColoredKitteh: qt crab
 orangesnowfox: Nah, I agree and like, actually agree... You know you've hit that point when you actually make a `str` kind of type
 orangesnowfox: and when you see `'a, 'b` in the same function lol
 SwagColoredKitteh: oh the fun of DSTs
 orangesnowfox: yeee
 SwagColoredKitteh: 10/10 would recommend
 SwagColoredKitteh: spent 10 hours fighting with rustc
 orangesnowfox: I've probably spent 30 hours... Total, out of thousands of hours using Rust
 SwagColoredKitteh: i make mistakes on purpose just to piss rustc off
 orangesnowfox: lol
 orangesnowfox: Oh, I have a joke for you SwagColoredKitteh
 SwagColoredKitteh: im gonna borrow this mutably whether you want it or not
 Astrobytes: That's crab baiting!
 orangesnowfox: When will&#160;! get stabilized?
 orangesnowfox:&#160;!
 SwagColoredKitteh: haha
 SwagColoredKitteh: indeed
 SwagColoredKitteh: i wonder why they call it&#160;!
 SwagColoredKitteh: why not just give it an actual name
 SwagColoredKitteh: just have std::void::Void or something
 King_Coda: I made an Advertisment for C++, you guys wanna hear it?
 XeroOl: My main complaint with rust is that the compile times take forever
 orangesnowfox: (for those who don't know what&#160;! is, it's the "Never" type, and it's been having trouble with stabilization because they want to change it to the fallback type for expressions but that causes bugs sometimes
 KiwiTae: KalamariKing I do you got issue in your base
 KiwiTae: its not 606-7 test 5
 SwagColoredKitteh: XeroOl that is what coffee is for
 KalamariKing: Wait so what is it?
 KiwiTae: its 123-7
 SwagColoredKitteh: in all seriousness yeah, rust compile times can get quite long
 KalamariKing: Hmm
 KalamariKing: Ok thanks
 King_Coda: C++. What's the plus? More work, more sleep lost trying to find out why you keep getting std::error_code::message. string message() const;, only to find out you misspelled cout as cuot!
 SwagColoredKitteh: there are ways to mitigate it but it's still not great
 SwagColoredKitteh: ok King_Coda you explained one plus but there are two, mind explaining the second plus?
 orangesnowfox: SwagColoredKitteh, you too can write your own&#160;! typeActually, there are quite a few out there
 SwagColoredKitteh: yeah, exactly, so why make&#160;! a type
 SwagColoredKitteh: err
 SwagColoredKitteh: rather, why name a type that
 orangesnowfox: well, because it already is one sometimes
 SwagColoredKitteh: it's so magical
 King_Coda: more work = + number 1
 King_Coda: the rest = + number 2
 King_Coda: :slight_smile:
 XeroOl: I dunno if any of you have looked at zig
 orangesnowfox: like...fn foo() -&gt;&#160;! { loop {} }compiles on stable rust
 SwagColoredKitteh: zig is cool
 XeroOl: but that is a programming language that I enjoy
 SwagColoredKitteh: i wish zig had unicode support in the stdlib and got rid of null-terminated strings though
 orangesnowfox: and you can call `foo` from a function that returns `T`, and it'll be okay (in fact, if you try to execute any code after `foo`, it'll warn you that it's unreachable)
 SwagColoredKitteh: but the rest of the language feels really cool to me
 King_Coda: Anyways, I gotta go learn C# for the contest. See ya
 SwagColoredKitteh: see you! and good luck!
 orangesnowfox: Wait, do you *have* to, or *want* to?
 XeroOl: why learn c# for the contest?
 King_Coda: I like the C languages
 XeroOl:&#160;???
 SwagColoredKitteh: C# is more similar to java than C or C++
 King_Coda: Also need to learn it for my job
 XeroOl: ahh, that makes sense
 SwagColoredKitteh: fair enough :D
 King_Coda: C#, C++, Javascript, all of that
 XeroOl: I use Kotlin for those types of competitions
 Astrobytes: your job?
 KiwiTae: you got a job at 16 Oo
 orangesnowfox: Same though?
 DomiKo: It so strange seeing chat right now
 orangesnowfox: I lost it a few months later
 King_Coda: Yeah, getting a job soon.
 KalamariKing: I got a job two days ago, after just turning 15
 orangesnowfox: But I did have a job at 16 for a while
 XeroOl: I feel like I should try the competition with a ridiculous language
 KalamariKing: a lot of my friends had jobs all the way back at 14
 XeroOl: just for fun
 KalamariKing: do it
 orangesnowfox: ... And then I got it again at 17, lol
 King_Coda: Use Go XeroOl
 KiwiTae: XeroOl do that to get cherry on top achievmeent
 XeroOl: I know all my friends will also be using lua
 XeroOl: so why not Lua lol
 King_Coda: All I hear is lua this lua that
 Astrobytes: I did too. First serious job was 17-18. Junior web dev, promoted from data entry by mucking around at lunchtime
 King_Coda: whats the big deal?
 XeroOl: Have you worked with lua?
 King_Coda: Nope.
 King_Coda: High level or low level?
 XeroOl: it's pretty high level
 Astrobytes: don't make me letmegooglethat
 XeroOl: they don't have integer types, only float
 DomiKo: Why go to work at this age?
 Astrobytes: And indices start at 1
 XeroOl: that too
 OnTheBrink: anyone know the timezone for the spring challenge?  not sure if the time is in my timezone or another. 
 Astrobytes: Our country is backwards DomiKo
 Astrobytes: Mine at least
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 XeroOl: it's kind of slow though, so I dunno if it's a good idea
 KalamariKing: DomiKo when do you all start?
 King_Coda: I don't really care for lua, eh
 DomiKo: I didn't
 struct: OnTheBrink there is a link ytou can click and it shows your time
 KalamariKing: My country starts at 14 in most states
 DomiKo: I will this year when I will be 22
 KalamariKing: :o
 KalamariKing: why so late
 orangesnowfox: DomiKo, at 16 it was "having money", at 17 it was "because I wouldn't have anywhere to live otherwise"
 KalamariKing: lol same
 XeroOl: King_Coda, you don't need to, it's not a great language
 Astrobytes: Yes orangesnowfox :D
 King_Coda: I need to start saving up money as soon as possible
 KiwiTae: i was escort at 21 :no_mouth:
 DomiKo: Some people told me, learn to get a good job first, then go to work
 King_Coda: That way I have enough when I move out
 KalamariKing: Lucky
 Astrobytes: Escort like 'escort' KiwiTae?
 orangesnowfox: I don't really want to get all into it, but the person providing money stopped being able to do so, and I was the only one who could pick up the slack to a decent degree at the time, plus the job offer landed in my lap
 KalamariKing: Some people told me, 'youre 15 now you can pay your rent or you can live on the streets' and now I have a job
 DomiKo: that's just sad
 DomiKo:&#160;:( 
 King_Coda: I just want enough money to move out at 18
 OnTheBrink: @struct, ok.  thanks.  Usually there is a countdown to confirm, and I didnt see a timezone on the time so wanted to be sure.
 King_Coda: Living with my parents eh
 Astrobytes: I had a rough time early on too, did my biology BSc and cell bio MSc way later in life
 King_Coda: no thanks
 orangesnowfox: lol, imagine being able to afford moving out at 18 even with a job .-.
 orangesnowfox: good luck though
 King_Coda: fox, apartments are cheap around here, and I'm moving in with my brother as well.
 orangesnowfox: oh? how much, usd?
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes old times ~ now I am doing robotics
 orangesnowfox: if you're willing to share, anyway
 King_Coda: 1500 a month for a 2 bedroom
 XeroOl: ouch
 orangesnowfox: haha... That... Isn't cheap, but still cheaper than where I'll be
 KiwiTae: ouch
 orangesnowfox: $1300 for a 1 bedroom .-.
 orangesnowfox: or more maybe
 Astrobytes: KiwiTae: That's quite an admission for public chat tho :rofl:Well done to you sir
 King_Coda: It's actually not that bad
 orangesnowfox: California? Because that sounds like Cali prices
 King_Coda: wages around here are very generous
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes :joy: nobody will remember 
 Zenoscave: I'm going to make a bot to remind people Kiwi
 orangesnowfox: Now I'm going to just to spite you  :p (seriously though, I probably won't remember)
 Astrobytes: I will! :smiling_imp:
 DomiKo: We will ;P 
 Zenoscave: Hive mind
 King_Coda: I will remember
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Zenoscave: Also hi all. chat sure is active today
 orangesnowfox: hey Zenoscave
 KiwiTae: (╯°Д°)╯︵/(.□ . \).
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: Hey Zeno
 King_Coda: Hello Zeno
 DomiKo: Chat now is like "HEY IT"S CONTEST TIME"
 orangesnowfox: protip Kiwi, if the internet is going to forget something, don't tell them that, they.... woon't
 Zenoscave: Did you know the contest is in less than 48 hours?
 struct: yeap
 Astrobytes: It's been a bit of a clusterfuc* earlier but a little more coherent now
 struct: I already have my bot ready
 Zenoscave: struct gz on game of the week
 struct: at least the first version
 gigolo: wow good luck everybody
 Zenoscave: wait was the game leaked?
 struct: thanks zeno
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: Many new users on Yinsh struct?
 King_Coda: Yes it was leaked
 struct: I have no idea
 Astrobytes: It wasn't King_Coda
 struct: My cpu has been on 100% for the last 12 hours
 King_Coda: I can't trust the validity of the source though
 Zenoscave: how do you have your first v1 then struct
 Astrobytes: Magic.
 KiwiTae: you already got your NN ready and trained&#160;? lol
 struct: no NN
 gigolo: i think the contest is related to pathfinding&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: struct clearly bruteforced the possible rulesets until they came up with the right one
 jacek: muzero eh?
 orangesnowfox: gigolo, pathfinding? That reminds me of AStarCraft from a while back... I started it and then never submitted lol
 King_Coda: Yo, struct got puzzle of the week?
 King_Coda: gg
 jacek: and they said yinsh would never be potw
 KalamariKing: anyone wanna help me make sense of something in pythonyes we're back here
 KalamariKing: before you all yell at me to 'just ask' i gotta type it all out
 KalamariKing: so shush
 King_Coda: I seriously need to make that chat activity graph
 Zenoscave: just ask
 Zenoscave: don't shush me while we're at it
 Hjax: hes been hinting he has a question without asking it for hours zeno
 King_Coda: I'll do that tomorrow. I feel like chat activity may be influenced by the event but eh i'll take multiple samples
 Hjax: maybe some day the question will come
 KalamariKing: I've asked a couple times, somewhat
 Astrobytes: Well he sort of did eventually Hjax
 KalamariKing: Just as I type it out I find the answer
 Zenoscave: King_Coda it is. have you been here before a contest before?
 KalamariKing: But the answer involves changing something and it becomes another bug
 KalamariKing: I've narrowed it down to this:
 Zenoscave: Hiya Hjax
 King_Coda: Nope zeno
 Astrobytes: Welcome to programming KalamariKing
 Zenoscave: Get ready for the scroll

 King_Coda: i don't even know js

 DomiKo: here is more than one language? lol
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 KalamariKing: Here's full code if you wanna try yourself

 KalamariKing: It's something wrong with the parsing of the two operation numbers, specifically if there are two
 Zenoscave: Right my bad. C# it is
 King_Coda: Yeah, C# gang
 DomiKo: :worried:
 KalamariKing: I feel like something is wrong with the *num1.append( (20**i)*numerals[lines] )* at the end of each loop
 Zenoscave: I'll beat Euler this time. I know it
 orangesnowfox: I'll either be using Kotlin or Rust, haven't decided yet
 Kawaii2007: ummm hi
 orangesnowfox: hi, Kawaii2007
 KalamariKing: Hello
 Kawaii2007: Im new 
 Astrobytes: Hi new.
 KalamariKing: Well welcome to CodinGame!
 Kawaii2007: thanks 
 Kawaii2007: I love coding then i found this 
 KalamariKing: Ignore Astro, he's... well, Astro
 KalamariKing: A lot of us got here that way to lol
 Kawaii2007: lol
 King_Coda: Don't ignore Astrobytes, he's my father!
 King_Coda: I will not let you disgrace my kind.
 Kawaii2007: lol
 King_Coda: Also Astro, what are you doing?
 Astrobytes: I have never sired an American child.
 Zenoscave: Talking to me
 King_Coda: When you say "Hi new", you follow up with "I'm dad"
 Astrobytes: And stroking my beard furiously
 King_Coda: You should know this!
 Astrobytes: I'm 38. Why the hell should I know that.
 Kawaii2007: oh shit
 King_Coda: Because it's the most basic of dad jokes!
 Zenoscave: Hi 38, I'm dad
 King_Coda: SEE
 King_Coda: Zeno understands.
 Uljahn: hi dad, im cat
 Kawaii2007: ummm
 Zenoscave: I'm not a good reference for understanding or common
 King_Coda: Lol
 Zenoscave: I have a dad joke calendar
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 King_Coda: Astro, if you're going to be a dad, you have to equip yourself with an arsenal of over-used cheesy jokes!
 Zenoscave: If two vegans get in a fight is it still having a beef?
 Kawaii2007: OMG my coding teacher tells us the worse jokes about computers 
 Zenoscave: Orions belt is a real waist of space
 Astrobytes: I am not, will not, and will never be a dad. Not if I can help it anyway.
 King_Coda: Have a free notification KalamariKing
 Hjax: astro do you actually have a beard? 
 Zenoscave: that joke is only about 3 stars
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave :rofl:
 Astrobytes: x2
 KalamariKing: King_Coda I was in another chat so that came through as an actual notification
 Kawaii2007: .........
 Zenoscave: Double dad joke Pewpew
 Astrobytes: A goatee Hjax
 King_Coda: Ooooh, goatee
 Zenoscave: I have the mountain man beard 
 Zenoscave: I look like 85% of software engineers in Denver
 Kawaii2007: ......................
 Solzerid: My dad is a physics teacher. I get the best hybrid dad/science teacher jokes.
 King_Coda: I'm still growing in on the sides of my face.
 Astrobytes: Lockdown beard was like a monstrous facial invasion of wiry scoundrels
 Hjax: do you frequent microbreweries Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: "facail invasion of wiry scoundrels" dot com
 Hjax: to complete the stereotype 
 Zenoscave: Hjax, don't call me out like that
 King_Coda: LOL
 Zenoscave: And I only drink IPA'
 Zenoscave: And I only drink IPA's
 Astrobytes: I do. Or did. AND I vape.
 King_Coda: I've only had a ginger beer
 Astrobytes: I don't ride a penny farthing though.
 Astrobytes: Or wear +4s
 Zenoscave: wait are those still a thing
 King_Coda: Actually I had champagne once.
 Zenoscave: the penny farthings
 King_Coda: Kawaii2007, welcome to chat.
 Astrobytes: Other than novelty, I don't think so
 Kawaii2007: Im learning javascript
 Zenoscave: That's just being a d**kNozzle
 Astrobytes: Just doing the hipster stereotype
 Zenoscave: Kawaii2007 how's JS going?
 King_Coda: I'm also looking to learn JS
 kingbojo: emos
 Kawaii2007: I just started 
 Zenoscave: emo hasn't been a thing since 2011 Kingbojo
 Astrobytes: It's my party and I'll cry if I want to kingbojo
 Astrobytes: Isn't it all screamo now?
 Kawaii2007: i don't understand
 jacek: they all killed themselves?
 Zenoscave: ... The artist in the ambulance started playing as I said that on spotify
 TobiasA: i fell asleep while lurking
 TobiasA: bye you guys
 King_Coda: Bye TobiasA
 Astrobytes: It listens...
 Hjax: hey jacek, how many nodes do you search per move in othello, i feel like ive asked someone this before, but i dont remember who or the answer
 Astrobytes: 42
 Zenoscave: 43
 orangesnowfox: 42
 orangesnowfox: Wait... 53
 Zenoscave: You have to give the wrong answer guys
 King_Coda: kingbojo, how dare you disgrace the King username with your foultries.
 Astrobytes: 128
 Kawaii2007: wtf 
 orangesnowfox: A nation of moves, truely indivisible
 Kawaii2007: ummm Im 14 
 Astrobytes: One nation under a move
 King_Coda: Hi 14, I'm dad
 Kawaii2007: *Kicks King_Coda*
 <b>**King_Coda slaps Kawaii2007 around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/16732569385856" /> Zenoscave: Kawaii2007 the chat here gets a bit sporadic. If you want to focus on coding, come in like 2 weeks. The contest starts in 2 days and will be a bit hectic at that time
 Kawaii2007: your not my dad
 King_Coda: Your kicks are no match for my slap
 King_Coda: *you're
 Astrobytes: *you're not my dad
 King_Coda: LOL
 King_Coda: :rofl:
 Kawaii2007: Im a soccer player fight me
 Zenoscave: astro I saw that comming
 Astrobytes: I resist
 King_Coda: I'm 6 ft tall, fight me
 orangesnowfox: I was a soccer player, umm, was a Hockey player too, I wouldn't want to fight
 Kawaii2007: fuck 
 Astrobytes: I'm astro, byte me
 Zenoscave: Hi 6 ft tall, I'm Dad
 King_Coda: LOL ASTRO
 Zenoscave: astro :rofl:
 KalamariKing: astro lmao
 King_Coda: ZENO LOL
 orangesnowfox: okay...
 DomiKo: 6ft? Do you have 6 feet?

 Zenoscave: he's ~1.85 metres
 DomiKo: 82
 DomiKo: he's small
 King_Coda: I'm 182 centimetres
 Astrobytes: also Kawaii2007: try not to swear/cuss without reason
 Zenoscave: Damn close enough
 Kawaii2007: okay 
 orangesnowfox: 185 .-. I don't like being tall
 Zenoscave: 188 here
 orangesnowfox: get smacked on ceilings or w/e
 DomiKo: damn Zeno 1cm more than me
 King_Coda: I'm still growing too
 KalamariKing: Alright
 KalamariKing: You all said not to ask, so
 Zenoscave: slanted ceiling stairwells are the bane of my existence
 Astrobytes: I'm about 6'4"
 King_Coda: got about 9 more years left in me
 Kawaii2007: Can u guys donate some inches to the ones an need
 Hjax: im like 172, not very tall

 KalamariKing: help
 KalamariKing: do it
 orangesnowfox: Kawaii, would totally do it
 King_Coda: Nah, I'll keep mine thank you very much
 orangesnowfox: I'll donate up to a foot of height
 Kawaii2007: YEAH
 orangesnowfox: free of charge
 Kawaii2007: YAY
 KalamariKing: haha imagine being tall
 Astrobytes: And that's 193cm in metric
 Kawaii2007: imagine be a higher coder then ur whole class
 Zenoscave: noice
 King_Coda: IMagine being short
 orangesnowfox: conclusion: humans have been getting taller on average because gravity has been decreasing /s
 orangesnowfox: err, not /s, /j
 King_Coda: Indeed
 Zenoscave: Kawaii2007 you're exactly the same as every one of your classmates. within an order of magnitude. In any coding metric.
 orangesnowfox: Dang
 King_Coda: Some people are better at coding AI, some are better at manipulating algorithms.
 Zenoscave: Everyone of the same learning time is. It takes time to learn. there are no gurus
 orangesnowfox: Zeno, I was about to say we were exactly the same by that logic ("less than 1 OOM rank wise") but you're actually in a different OOM lol
 Kawaii2007: Then why am i in javaspcrit and my class is still in HTML
 orangesnowfox: html... html isn't a programming language
 Kawaii2007: Yes
 KalamariKing: html is markup :o
 Kawaii2007: it
 Kawaii2007: yep
 King_Coda: html is nasty
 Zenoscave: Kawaii2007 i didn't say you aren't better. you're just not *that* much better
 Kawaii2007: thats what she said
 King_Coda: HTML5 is a slight improvement
 KalamariKing: zeno lol
 Zenoscave: Basically humble yourself
 orangesnowfox: html5 + css3 is a programming language tho
 KalamariKing: its really not
 orangesnowfox: turing complete tho
 Zenoscave: It is turing complete. not a lang.
 orangesnowfox: good point
 Zenoscave: It is only turing complete through GoL emulation
 KalamariKing: javascript... now we're coding
 Zenoscave: which is turing complete. It has no means of stdio
 Astrobytes: which doesn't say a great deal
 Kawaii2007: why me
 Hjax: theres a lot of weird things that are turing complete 
 Zenoscave: My point
 Hjax: minecraft is turing complete lol 
 King_Coda: Javascript is used in 97% of web applications
 orangesnowfox: minecraft isn't even accidentally turing complete lol
 Zenoscave: Coffee brew bubbles are quantum machines
 KalamariKing: turing complete means what again? asking for a friend, i totally know
 Zenoscave: Being turing complete means nothing in the grand scheme
 Hjax: means it can do anything a turing machine can 
 orangesnowfox: ^
 jacek: universal turing machine*
 orangesnowfox: Which, is basically all computers nowadays
 KalamariKing: You all are impressive with your knowledge
 King_Coda: Anyways, I gotta bounce. See all you chuckleheads later

 jacek: nah, they dont have infinite capacity
 KalamariKing: glhf King_Coda
 Astrobytes: chuckleheads...
 orangesnowfox: and if they aren't *stronger* than a turing machine, they can't solve the halting problem :p
 King_Coda: Well I would have said Chucklef*cks...
 Hjax: the lack of infinite tapes is really puts a damper on our computers :P
 King_Coda: but Astro said no cussing
 King_Coda: Bye
 orangesnowfox: You're right, we need to have infinite ram, but first, we need infinite engergy
 orangesnowfox: *energy, heck
 Rabeeb: what is the time zone of the soring event time?
 Rabeeb: *spring
 Hjax: is it not localized automatically?
 Hjax: mine says 10am
 Rabeeb: oh then it is localized ig
 Zenoscave: 10am here too
 orangesnowfox: &gt; The event starts on Thursday, May 6th at 2 pm UTC and ends on Monday, May 17 at 8 am UTC. It starts at the same time for all players in the world, whatever the time zone.It's definitely localized (my browser timezone is utc)
 Zenoscave: I think???
 Zenoscave: 8AM&#160;!? I'm missing the first hour at least
 davilla: mine says 9am so yeah local
 Hjax: 10 am is about when im getting to work
 Zenoscave: Ah there's no way i'm waking up at 7am
 Kawaii2007: for its 2:06pm
 Kawaii2007: me
 Rabeeb: mine is 8pm
 Hjax: so ill have all day of rereading the spec and waiting to go home 
 davilla: so what do people do, code 24 hours straight, no sleep?
 orangesnowfox: yeah, no way I'm waking up at 7 am
 orangesnowfox: davilla, there's 11 days to the compo
 Zenoscave: I may be comming down with covid... *Cough cough* can't work for 13 days
 Hjax: the contest is 11 days long, and usually the full rules arent unlocked at first @davilla
 Kawaii2007: its 14 tbh
 davilla: oh so I can sleep in, that's good
 Kawaii2007: lol
 orangesnowfox: Sleeping enough is actually important because it keeps your mind in a condition to code
 davilla: wait I thought it was 11 days
 orangesnowfox: lol
 Hjax: its 11 days 
 Astrobytes: that's 14 in KiwiTae-me
 Zenoscave: baduntiss
 davilla: I was thinking, I'd better do taxes now
 BlaiseEbuth: Pew pew pew in the aire
 BlaiseEbuth: *air
 KalamariKing: hello again blaise
 Zenoscave: pew pew pew blaise
 KalamariKing: you only help with some obscure language starting with an r right
 KalamariKing: Like rust or ruby or somthing
 KalamariKing: something*
 BlaiseEbuth: Ruby&#160;? Me&#160;? Never&#160;!
 Astrobytes: There was something in the air that night, pewpew so bright, Blaise Ebuuuth
 Kawaii2007: HOW DO U DO THE CLASH OF CODE
 KalamariKing: by doing do
 KalamariKing: so*
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop screaming
 Zenoscave: Ruby's good
 KalamariKing: you click start, you code uber-fast, and you win
 KalamariKing: ez
 BlaiseEbuth: pz
 Kawaii2007: what
 KalamariKing: ezpz
 orangesnowfox: KalamariKing lol, imagine Rust being obscure 
 Zenoscave: ezpz fix it
 orangesnowfox: fix Rust?
 Astrobytes: Remove the moisture and the O2 and rust begone!
 KalamariKing: just gotta do a thing, I want the link, ignore it (or not, idk)

 Kawaii2007: idk
 Astrobytes: Thank you for posting code with no context.
 KalamariKing: yw &lt;3
 Astrobytes: Again.
 KalamariKing: ofc, always, for you astro &lt;3
 Kawaii2007: Why me
 KalamariKing: if you NEED context, I wanted the link
 Astrobytes: If ye don't stop yer nonsense laddie ah'll hae t'gie ye a kick
 KalamariKing: That's the code for the mayan thing, yes, its been 6 hours straight and yes, I still havent done it
 KalamariKing: 90% tho and based on it being division, its probably a float vs int thing
 BlaiseEbuth: *no
 KalamariKing: whatever
 Astrobytes: There is no shame in spending time on a puzzle.
 KalamariKing: my brain hurst blaise
 KalamariKing: *hurts, god
 Astrobytes: Yes my child?
 Uljahn: use debug printing [solved]
 BlaiseEbuth: 99% that's because you're using python
 KalamariKing: yup
 Kawaii2007: I was i had a someone
 KalamariKing: you do
 Kawaii2007: yeah
 KalamariKing: the voices in your head don't count? they're offended
 Astrobytes: Was a someone I had I?
 BlaiseEbuth: doubidoubidoudododo

 billygoat2233: ok
 struct: You can type /join clash instead
 Astrobytes: or /join goatking
 KalamariKing: wait can I really
 KalamariKing: oh sick
 KalamariKing: chat's bursting at the seams with features
 AntiSquid: geez what's this red thing doing in here?
 AntiSquid: someone having fun with alts again?
 struct: you have been slacking AntiSquid
 struct: Time to bring the hammer
 KalamariKing: we back
 AntiSquid: sure, who's the main account?
 KalamariKing: :o
 KalamariKing: howd you know
 BlaiseEbuth: Main account of who? 
 AntiSquid: of that prank someone's trying to pull in here
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking::interrobang:
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid of whom do you speak
 AntiSquid: ok guess it's genuine then
 Astrobytes: He speaks of the name that cannot be spoken.
 r-k-g:&#160;??
 AntiSquid: "That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die."
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm probably too exhausted to follow this conversation...
 AntiSquid: idk maybe
 Astrobytes: You should be well versed in the Necronomicon BlaiseEbuth
 AntiSquid: good point, did you read any of Lovecraft books BlaiseEbuth&#160;?
 struct: ofc its an alt
 struct: its same thing
 struct: recycle
 BlaiseEbuth: I am. That's the only sentence I understood...
 AntiSquid: well it's level 14 and never seen it before
 struct: ah not him
 struct: Avatar just wasnt loading
 Astrobytes: There are a large number of kids this past month or so
 struct: Well during contest it will bans left and right
 Astrobytes: I think struct may have referred to Kawaii
 BlaiseEbuth: If you're speaking of the kalamar he's here since a few days...
 struct: I have enough time during contest
 struct: I already coded afterall
 AntiSquid: i guess i missed most of the "fun" lately
 Astrobytes: No fun.
 Astrobytes: my babe
 Astrobytes: No fuuuuun.
 r-k-g: no ban pls
 Astrobytes: *see The Stooges or the Sex Pistols to interpret my comment

 AntiSquid: is that envy? BlaiseEbuth
 r-k-g: why does it seem like there's such a large french presence on this site?
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid I've seen you plenty of times
 BlaiseEbuth: A little yeah... One day users will beg by seeing me too.
 Astrobytes: Because it's a French company, based in France.
 AntiSquid: where&#160;? KalamariKing
 BlaiseEbuth: Under the sea
 KalamariKing: In main anti
 KalamariKing: This chat
 KalamariKing: A couple times, though some days ago and with a different pfp
 Astrobytes: Down where it's wetter, down where it's better, take it from me
 BlaiseEbuth: :crab:
 AntiSquid: r-k-g Napoleon did win the war after all and the rest is a conspiracy
 Astrobytes: Or the other way around, it's been a long time since I heard that crab sing
 BlaiseEbuth: Why was I searching that crab emoji in the food tab...
 r-k-g: lol
 AntiSquid: on a serious note, watching these inflation videos and hope it's just "scaremongering", i know it isn't&#160;:/
 KalamariKing: inflation? As in monetary?
 BlaiseEbuth: Anarchy in th UK!
 r-k-g: ah yes the uk
 AntiSquid: i am sure it's coming to the US first KalamariKing
 r-k-g: cool place but I'm glad I don't live there
 Astrobytes: 1. It's not cool 2. Yes.
 AntiSquid: canada literally a cool place, glad i don't live there
 KalamariKing: anti So you do mean monetary
 littlewhinging: Herro
 KalamariKing: Howdy
 Astrobytes: Always preferred this alt take of Anarchy in the UK. Bit rougher!<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP_Tu52Hsb8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP_Tu52Hsb8</a>

 Astrobytes: Wake well BlaiseEbuth
 struct: Whats better currently intel or amd?
 struct: My 4 threads cant keep up
 KalamariKing: I'm diehard AMD
 KalamariKing: AMD is cheaper per arbitrary unit performance
 AntiSquid: i have a ryzen struct
 KalamariKing: Sites like UserBenchMark are HEAVILY on the side of intel, so don't trust the reviews
 KalamariKing: Intel runs hot
 KalamariKing: AMD runs well
 KalamariKing: That's how I think about it... but its up to you, idk
 KalamariKing: Upgradability in the future? AMD for sure, intel you need a whole new mobo most of the time
 AntiSquid: is your main a hardware specialist? :thinking:
 struct: I see, guess I will have to do some research
 AntiSquid: useful site: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/">https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/</a>
 Kawaii2007: im back 
 Astrobytes: Great. He's front. Some one else is right. In a minute I left.
 AntiSquid: level 3&#160;: im back 
 Kawaii2007: hi
 Kawaii2007: hi
 Astrobytes: You share my suspicion
 struct: I was waiting for the 3rd
 AntiSquid: oh that? you think it's that&#160;?
 Astrobytes: 3 hi's to make a kick
 struct: no
 struct: ban
 Astrobytes: I think it's That One
 Westicles: kk?
 Westicles: I don't think that's hii
 AntiSquid: no, something worse
 Astrobytes: No one mentioned hii
 struct: o.o
 AntiSquid: gn8, don't let the chat trolls bite
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn AntiSquid, I'm off soon too
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: Soon, not instantly lol
 struct: sorry 
 struct: Anyone has any idea why nth_element is different on gcc and msvc?
 Astrobytes: It is?
 struct: It doesnt exactly do the same
 struct: let me show an example, 1 sec
 struct: msvc: 2 3 10 23 33 45 47 56gcc: 3 2 10 23 33 56 45 47

 KalamariKing: What time is it for you all? Why y'all leaving?
 struct: 00:00
 KalamariKing: Is it actually
 struct: 23:53
 KalamariKing: Bruv
 KalamariKing: Sleep
 Astrobytes: 23.53 here too
 struct: Im fine
 KalamariKing: SLEEP
 struct: isnt it a bit strange Astro?
 KalamariKing: I'm not one to talk I stay up rather late but you need sleep, so get some. plus with the contest coming up, every little bit of mental capacity is an edge
 struct: Its like nthelement sorts on MSVC
 struct: while on gcc it doesnt care
 struct: I think I should ask this question to Robo
 struct: oh the code is different
 DomiKo: yeah STL implementations could differ across compilators
 Astrobytes: I was about to say about the implementation, I think it's an issue
 DomiKo: sort could differ too
 DomiKo: like if you have array [(1, 'A'), (1, 'B')]
 DomiKo: if you sort that only by first element in pair
 DomiKo: you could get [(1, 'A'), (1, 'B')] or [(1, 'B'), (1, 'A')]
 struct: I see, thanks
 Astrobytes: Yeah, check that out before anything else
 struct: I guess I will test on gcc then
 Astrobytes: And now I will sleep. Gn all
 struct: gn
 DomiKo: gn
 Notter: Hi
 struct: hi
 Notter: Can you comment on my contribution?
 KalamariKing: _struct you should sleep too
 KalamariKing: Notter i gotchu, but what for?

 KalamariKing: I'm in eagle-central so its still day here
 KalamariKing: Why capital O's
 KalamariKing: Why not something like #'s which would look more 'full' in the rings
 Notter: Uhh let's go to the contribution chat
 Notter: Nice suggestion though
 CryptoZenith: i pulled my first official all nighter last night
 KalamariKing: amazing
 KalamariKing: welcome to the sleep deprivation club
 Notter: How do you ping?
 KalamariKing: Just type their name
 KalamariKing: If the name matches anyone within chat, you can press tab to autocomplete
 KalamariKing: e.x. 'kala[tab]' --&gt; 'KalamariKing'
 KalamariKing: try it with 'not'
 KalamariKing: 'not[tab]' --&gt; 'Notter'
 Notter: [tab]
 Notter: I thought that would work
 Notter: Not[tab]
 Notter: not[tab]
 KalamariKing: You have to actually press tab
 KalamariKing: 'not{press the tab key}'
 KalamariKing: Notter
 Notter: Notter
 KalamariKing: yeah! see?
 KalamariKing: ezpz
 CryptoZenith: Notter
 Notter: Yes
 KalamariKing: We do try to cut down on unnecessary pings tho, it can get annoying CryptoZenith
 Zongle: Are there any tutorials about how to get setup for machine learning during a contest?  Like idk how to use an actual IDE but still have the game available, like in the browser
 KalamariKing: I have no clue, but would love to know the answer
 KalamariKing: Most of the people that I know are good with ml are asleep rn
 Zongle: Gotcha.  They might just rebuild the whole game in a private environment for all I know.  Just wish I knew how the people good at contests even get their environment set up haha

 KalamariKing: God I got a lot of reading to catch up on tomorrow&#160;:/
 davilla: wow hypnotoad is everywhere
 KalamariKing: indeed
 Notter: It's already May 5th where I'm living
 KalamariKing: :o
 KalamariKing: time flies
 davilla: that means it starts sooner for you&#160;:-P
 msys: heey
 KalamariKing: Hello!
 davilla: yeah, ouch, this isn't for me
 Notter: Wait
 KalamariKing: Wait what
 Notter: Why is the start date at May 6th?
 KalamariKing: Idk
 msys: returning back after years of sleeping haha
 davilla: today is May the 4th be with You, tomorrow is 5 de Mayo, couldn't start on a holiday you know
 KalamariKing: oh lol
 CryptoZenith: lmao
 KalamariKing:  may 7th is the 127th day of the year and for a coding competition, 127 is a power of two (0-indexed)
 KalamariKing: may 6th is just boring
 davilla: if I can get technical for a moment, those are formally known as "computer numbers"
 KalamariKing: Sure
 XeroOl: hahaha I have created a contribution
 XeroOl: it is the first step in my plan to world domination
 davilla: you're going to dominate the world with Ruby?
 XeroOl: I guess lol
 davilla: trying to figure out how your code works but I don't get.&amp;it
 XeroOl: maybe I should make the example solution more clearly follow the problem lol
 davilla: it's just doing a count of the distance, right?
 XeroOl: yeah
 davilla: because ultimately that's all that burble sort does
 XeroOl: the reason I reverse the list is because `inputs.index` finds the first index of the item
 XeroOl: but I really want the last index
 davilla: oh, index is a function on inputs, and it takes inputs.max as a parameter?
 XeroOl: yeah
 davilla: Ruby is so weird
 XeroOl: ruby lets you leave out parentheses in some cases
 XeroOl: I probably should put them in
 davilla: well, it's the choice of the language
 davilla: to be difficult to read I mean
 XeroOl: should I do it in python, and do an actual bubble sort?
 joniebear: Ruby is lovely but I follow the path of the 🐍
 XeroOl: it would be easier to follow
 XeroOl: python can be pretty confusing too lol
 davilla: don't worry, I just like complaining
 XeroOl: okay, have the same code but with more parentheses
 davilla: your solution is fine, approvers have to code their own
 davilla: I will approve if you say "Burble Sort is a terrible algorithm..."
 XeroOl: lmao
 XeroOl: let me code a confusing python one liner first, and then I'll say that
 davilla: I'm going to invent a language that doesn't allow one-line programs
 davilla: I think I'll call it Java
 XeroOl: it will be a bad language lol
 XeroOl: you can do some pretty illegal stuff with long lines in java
 davilla: I think I'll call it Pascal
 XeroOl: those long lines will include ".stream()" in them&#160;:)
 joniebear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/nYC9fusw">https://pastebin.com/nYC9fusw</a> From a recent CTF where you had to inject code but weren't allowed quotes :P
 davilla: +1 good programming practices
 XeroOl: hold on should I do this in java then?
 davilla: all the true golfers use Bash for what it's worth
 joniebear: There's an achievement if you solve a specific puzzle in Bash. It's like walking on broken glass or something :D
 davilla: a language that's named after the verb you presume someone used on their keyboard to generate the code
 davilla: do you know which puzzle?
 joniebear: Yeah, give me a sec
 davilla: cool this might be my very first Bash program
 joniebear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/horse-racing-duals">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/horse-racing-duals</a>
 davilla: or I might fail and go live in a hut in the middle of the woods
 joniebear: There's also 10xp for the first time you solve a puzzle in a new language, I got 70% of the languages done. Don't drink and code, kids...
 davilla: but now your profile is littered with languages
 davilla: nevermind I'm not going to start a new language unless I can get 5 bars
 joniebear: No, they are neatly listed in a box&#160;:)&#160;:) 
 joniebear: Yeah, unfortunately clashes don't count towards that. I don't enjoy the puzzles as much... 
 davilla: not even the bot programming?
 joniebear: Also, there is "Babylon Tower", which requires 100% in 15 languages. 
 XeroOl: I got that one lol
 joniebear: Not even the bots, nah. It's completely outside my domain, so it takes a long time and is frustrating. 
 davilla: there you go, the Old Testament has stood the test of time
 joniebear: I like the clashes because they are shorter problems, bite sized&#160;:) 
 davilla: I don't think you can really say you know a language, unless you can clash in the language
 joniebear: define "can clash" 
 davilla: put it this way: I'd like to redo that branch of the Quest Map in C#, and again in Javascript, etc.
 davilla: I only did one clash in each of those languages, and all the others in python
 davilla: and I was Googling like mad
 joniebear: Because Python is  generally superior, except for some cases of "shortest". 
 davilla: well also because I've been using python for many years now, and only occasionally delve into another language
 davilla: but I mean it's hard to disagree with you, that's why I use it&#160;:-P
 joniebear: I have to admit, I'm a late convert. My daily driver used to be Perl until maybe 2-3 years ago, when I forced myself to use Python instead, even if it took me 10x the time at first. 
 davilla: Perl is the one they call write-only?
 davilla: mostly all regular expressions
 joniebear: It has the capability for that, yes. But regular expression are the same in any language. Perl just has them without all the fancy noise around them. I recently had to convert something ancient and unmaintained from Perl into Python, and was surprised how smooth that went. 
 XeroOl: lmao I got a java that mostly works
 XeroOl: but fails on duplicates
 XeroOl: with as much code as humanly possible on one line
 davilla: RegEx always felt like they were a compression of something that didn't have a more conventional format... kind of when you look at f-strings and you think, why can't they just spell this out, why so cryptic?
 XeroOl: f strings aren't that cryptic though?
 davilla: one line? I put you up to this
 XeroOl: I guess all the formatter properties are a bit funny
 XeroOl: it doesn't work because Collections.binarySearch isn't consistent with duplicates
 XeroOl: but
 XeroOl: here's the monster line:
 XeroOl: System.out.println(j.stream().mapToInt(Integer::parseInt).map(x -&gt; {int k = Collections.binarySearch(l, x); l.add(k&lt;0?~k:k, x); return k&lt;0?~k:k; }).sum());
 XeroOl: but it's pretty scary looking java
 joniebear: f strings aren't cryptic at all. It makes so much sense to write print(f... :D 
 davilla: when I look at f-strings, I find an example of exactly what I want to do, because if I try to read the docs on it my eyes start to glaze over
 XeroOl: ah, yes, lets just use c's printf instead
 XeroOl: where everything is better
 joniebear: And all the stuff that goes inside, is just regular format() format... 
 joniebear: And they offer so much room for abuse in shortest clashes 💌
 davilla: printf along the same lines... maybe I shouldn't have brought that up as an example
 XeroOl: ahh yes, c++'s famously easy formatting system
 XeroOl:  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::setprecision(2) &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "\n";
 davilla: yeah I'm sure RegEx would be great in shortest if you needed pattern matching, but my point is what's the expanded version? there is none
 XeroOl: have you ever worked with something called a Parsing Expression Grammer?
 XeroOl: PEG?
 XeroOl: look up pyPEG
 davilla: I've seen formal stuff like this, but haven't coded in anything like it
 davilla: maybe in a compilers class or something
 XeroOl: well, it's not a trivial thing to express
 XeroOl: that's why regex is so useful
 davilla: uncondensed RegEx would be something like:optional("1"), digit, ":", digit, digit, optional(("A" or "P"), "M")
 joniebear: But they DID invent RegEx, so we don't have to do that anymore :P 
 davilla: I mean that could be a RegEx spec
 davilla: and if it was, you could actually comment it, and wouldn't that be useful!?
 joniebear: I'll look into pyPEG though, that's something I haven't used since the Perl days. 
 davilla: this is the hour, these are the minutes
 joniebear: Fair point, comments would be helpful if you aren't used to reading it. 
 joniebear: But then you got all these websites now that dissect it for you and explain it.
 davilla: and even if you are
 davilla: you've never looked back at your Perl code and thought, what was I trying to do here?
 kresteodymium: hello world
 joniebear: Nah. I have looked at it and not understood why it succeeded at doing what it was supposed to do :D
 davilla: heh
 davilla: same difference
 joniebear: But none of that was because of the RegEx... 
 joniebear: Most of it comes from dereferencing nested arrays and hashes :D
 joniebear: Okay, maybe this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/eJRHti2R">https://pastebin.com/eJRHti2R</a>
 davilla: yeah, I love the comment :D
 davilla: :laughing:
 joniebear: truth be told, it only exists in that comment. the actual one in use is simple and elegant...
 davilla: ah OK
 joniebear: alright, out for today. not getting any progress in the clashes right now.
 davilla: later
 AI_one: {
 Smelty: *depression*
 spiralpinata: lmao I didnt know comments are also counted
 spiralpinata: that would shorten my code by a lot
 spiralpinata: I think they should make it so that comments wont be counted as characters in code

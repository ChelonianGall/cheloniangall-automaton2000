 derjack: good morning
 BlaiseEbuth: 'n
 Peached: a
 juice0: s
 cheraigel: Good morning good people
 derjack: who
 GroutchKeu: No such thing as "good people"&#160;:|
 Altonormz: good morning good, people
 brotatotes: good morning
 sapfeer0k: Morning, the website is repaired, good&#160;:)
 derjack: repaired?
 TimGas: good morning
 TimGas: help me please
 Uljahn: pls elaborate
 zax121: how do i do this?
 zax121: im doing what it says
 Uljahn: this is a general chat, it's not specific to the problem you're on
 Uljahn: so pls give more details
 KiwiTae: Uljahn o/ 
 Uljahn: hi Kiwo
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: we need more context
 Automaton2000: even if they dont have to be
 zax121: i just started this thing that said ai and im suppose to make the thing go to the targets but it's not moving
 KiwiTae: coder strikes back?
 zax121: yes
 KiwiTae: theres a hint button on the left
 Peached: i also struggle alot at it
 Peached: just takes time
 Peached: ill just never make it to legend my 2 pods are idiots
 zax121: theres no hitn button for me
 zax121: *hint
 Peached: i dont think theres hints in ai games
 Peached: what code u got so far
 Uljahn: coders strike back is a tutorial game, so it gives some popups with hints which can be dismissed
 Peached: ohh. guess was too long ago for me
 Uljahn: zax121: paste your code here
 Peached: hm
 zax121: k
 zax121: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe5abcd4-8563-4a8e-9b5b-9933a34c9e6b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe5abcd4-8563-4a8e-9b5b-9933a34c9e6b</a>
 Peached: problems
 Peached: print(str(next_checkpoint_y) + "  " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 50")
 Peached: they are both y
 Peached: the first one should be next_checkpojnt_x
 Peached: and idk u pasted the code like 3 times i guess its fine
 zax121: what do i change
 Uljahn: guess you should first click "restore default code" at the top-right corner of IDE
 Peached: change line 24
 Uljahn: then fix your output to be x, y instead of y, y
 Peached: coders strike back teams when
 zax121: like this print(str(next_checkpoint_y) + "x,y " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 50")
 Peached: no
 Peached: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + "  " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 50")
 Peached: you made a mistake, both of the 'next_checkpoint' should not be y
 Thyl: Peached
 Peached: hi
 Thyl: print in python has a super power&#160;:)
 Peached: fax
 Thyl: print(x,y,"50")
 Thyl: is&#160;:
 Peached: AAAAAA WHEN CAN I BEAT DARTHBOSS
 Peached: wait thats possiblr?
 Thyl: &lt;value of x&gt; &lt;value of y&gt; 50
 Peached: *i use too much f strings and in codingame im just useless
 Peached: lemme try that
 Peached: genius
 Thyl: f string is good....
 Peached: idk y i dont do it in codingame
 Thyl: read the docs and you will have no problem with f string
 zax121: thanks im on the second part now
 Peached: kool
 Peached: how do i fix the thing that it often does a wrong turn like it wouldve been easier if it turns left but it does a 360 right?
 Peached: im raging of that
 MSmits: calculate the angle difference between your heading and the angle you want to have
 MSmits: pick the change in angle that is in the direction of the smallest change
 MSmits: just make sure you do it right around 0
 Peached: idk how to count the angle i want to have
 MSmits: well you have to error output all your input every turn. See what it tells you about how angles work in csb
 MSmits: then check different frames
 MSmits: see which way the pod is facing
 Peached: hmmmmmmm
 Peached: ill try
 MSmits: remember that when angles become negative, there's a point where they become maximal
 MSmits: not sure if it;s [0,360] or [-180,180]
 MSmits: have to account for this with some kind of condition
 MSmits: this is probably the reason it does the wrong turn
 MSmits: oh and your language might use radians
 MSmits: check that too
 Uljahn: guess the reason is he doesn't account for the next next checkpoint, also what's "a 360 right" thing?
 MSmits: thats when you want to do 1 degree left
 MSmits: to get to the correct angle
 MSmits: but instead it does 359 right
 MSmits: to get to the same angle
 Uljahn: is it possible in csb gold?
 zax121: im stuck again
 MSmits: this is possible whenever you code something to do with angles
 MSmits: it might just be something in his code. Possibly overcomplicating things
 MSmits: but yeah it's possible
 Uljahn: but you output x and y, not the angle
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: but you could be using angles in calculation
 MSmits: and come out to some x and y that reflect this problem
 MSmits: who knows what he;s doing in his code
 MSmits: it's just a common angle problem
 Uljahn: zax121: and?
 derjack: "step mod, help me"
 Uljahn: :smirk:
 MSmits: zax121, wriggle it around a bit, maybe it'll come loose
 MSmits: good to see you can still type though
 IamQuan:&#160;:&gt;
 zax121: im suppose to change my thrust and i did but its not moving
 Peached: higher or lower?
 zax121: i think higher
 KiwiTae: zax121 share your code so w can see maybe
 KiwiTae: or maybe u did i wasnt checkin hehe
 Wontonimo: yippie, I finally got around to porting to C4
 Louzy: My question is:
 Wontonimo: which challenge?
 Louzy: Platinium Rift - Episode 2
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by C4&#160;?
 Wontonimo: connect 4
 AntiSquid: oh ... nvm then
 Wontonimo: Louzy , i haven't done Platinium Rift
 Louzy: Hmmm ok 
 Louzy: Should i start with Platinum or do you recommend another one for starters&#160;?
 Wontonimo: if you haven't done coders strikes back, start there
 Wontonimo: here's the link Louzy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard</a>
 Louzy: Thank you
 Wontonimo: what language do you prefer to use for programming?  c++, rust, python, java, javascript?  And how much experience do you have?
 Wontonimo:&#160;:( looks like the roll-over to check peoples standing is no longer working
 Astrobytes: yeah, I reported it on the weekend
 KiwiTae: my fav feature&#160;:( :p
 derjack: theyll fix it on next friday deployment cycle
 Wontonimo: thanks derjack
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: hey struct - i've finally joined C4 :D
 struct: nice, feel free to ask if you have any questions
 Wontonimo: thanks.  i got the 63bit state per player implemented.  Super fast win condition check implemented. 
 struct: also dont worry too much about performance
 struct: its not very important
 Wontonimo: ooohhh
 Wontonimo: i was going gangbusters on performance 
 derjack: says the guy who has 4.5 rollouts ~
 Astrobytes: 4.5 eh
 derjack: speed
 Astrobytes: 4.5 rollouts per turn? :P
 derjack: eeyup
 darkhorse64: x 1M
 derjack: its implied
 4DsErfan: write ur discord bellow
 Astrobytes: I don't have a discord bellow
 struct: I dont know my discord
 Astrobytes: And even if I did I wouldn't let you hear it
 MSmits: come on, share that bellow with us
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: or just DM me the bellow. But let me dial down my speakers first
 Astrobytes: hahaha, I'll pass
 MSmits: aww ok
 Astrobytes: some other time perhaps :P
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: btw, almost done with D&amp;B, got one more thing to try
 Astrobytes: What's left?
 MSmits: a loopy heuristic I can use when my calc time is reserved for nim and score solving
 MSmits: works for marchete
 Astrobytes: was about to say is that something to do with marchete
 MSmits: yeah, he still beats mikla a lot when i try in the IDE, more than me
 Astrobytes: You still up top?
 MSmits: i didnt submit so yeah, but my wr vs mikla is &lt;40%
 MSmits: so if i submit a lot, i am 2nd
 Astrobytes: Hm. Sounds worth trying the loopy thing
 BlaiseEbuth: If I stand on a chair, I'm tall.
 MSmits: yeah, should not be too hard and not be too much code
 MSmits: good for you BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Thx. You too
 Astrobytes: thanks for sharing Blaise!
 MSmits: not me, I'm short when standing on a chair
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... But you're second if you submit a lot. Not me, he.
 dbdr: for me it depends on the size of the chair
 Astrobytes: If I submit a lot CG stops me submitting
 struct: but submit is the only way to test
 Astrobytes: therein lies the problem
 BlaiseEbuth: And if in addition you rank well, you could lose your mod status! Be careful :scream:
 struct: im not good enough to rank well
 Amir50: :laughing:
 4DsErfan: still waiting for discord tags
 MSmits: you were asking for discord bellows, that's not the same
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth write 'Anarchy' with paint on the wall.</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: are you a recruiter?
 BlaiseEbuth: Who&#160;?
 struct: 4d
 4DsErfan: whats dat
 BlaiseEbuth: See 4DsErfan, I made a discord tag on the wall.
 Astrobytes: Digital Audio Tapes, used to be the standard in most recording studios
 Astrobytes: (dat)
 Astrobytes: For instance, I could have recorded my discord bellows on it
 BlaiseEbuth: Recording studios doesn't use .wav&#160;? :o
 Astrobytes: *used* to be standard
 BlaiseEbuth: And they use wav now? -_-
 BlaiseEbuth: Was a joke
 Astrobytes: oh, sorry :grin:
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: was crazy how fast HDD  recording took over from DAT though
 BlaiseEbuth: Hoooooo Doobi Doo&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes. The industry standard :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Haven't sleep since more than 24 hours. I'm looking a t my code like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IDTN5jjI9OU/VoqyxFKfjcI/AAAAAAAAEac/5Duxo3MNSUU/s1600/gandalf.png">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IDTN5jjI9OU/VoqyxFKfjcI/AAAAAAAAEac/5Duxo3MNSUU/s1600/gandalf.png</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, take a nap dude
 BlaiseEbuth: :sleeping:
 struct: I just become a zombie at the keyboard
 struct: after so much time
 Astrobytes: sure-fire way to introduce bugs and weird code
 BlaiseEbuth: Some call that 'features'.
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: :raised_hand:
 struct: we need knightthrough
 Astrobytes: the breakthrough variant that nobody asked for?
 struct: yes
 struct: instead of pawns its knights
 Astrobytes: does it exist?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: madness
 Astrobytes: any good?
 BlaiseEbuth: madknightthroug
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: no idea
 struct: I dont really play any of these games
 Astrobytes: well, give it a shot and see what happens
 MSmits: he says after being stuck on breakthrough for a month
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 AllYourTrees: more like lamethrough amirite
 Astrobytes: Limpthrough
 AllYourTrees: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Louzy: why did i reach
 Louzy: A limited number of plays
 Louzy:&#160;?
 Louzy: And how do i remove it
 MSmits: because the number of plays is limited
 MSmits: and you wait
 Louzy: Haaa k Ty
 Louzy: How long if i may ask&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Until it disapeat
 MSmits: not sure, a few mins
 BlaiseEbuth: *r
 MSmits: maybe 10-15, not sure
 Louzy: how many plays do i have&#160;?
 MSmits: it's not a set number
 Louzy: And why cant it be infinite&#160;?
 MSmits: you can probably do it 50 times in an hour or so
 BlaiseEbuth: Cause you don't pay servers
 MSmits: because it costs money
 Louzy: That was a stupid question ngl i didnt even think
 MSmits: if you spend some more time coding  and debugging before you try, you should never reach it
 MSmits: mind you, i sometimes hit it, but not often
 Louzy: But thank you MSmits and BlaiseEbuth
 AllYourTrees: i hit it all the time lol :D
 MSmits: did you change things between tries?
 AllYourTrees: i just randomly comment out parts of my code and play a few times to see what happens
 Louzy: Me 2 xd
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Louzy: I did alot
 MSmits: yeah thats a fast way to hit it
 BlaiseEbuth: AllYourTry
 Louzy: I cant pass the first coders strike back the one where you have to use the if statment
 Louzy: When i thought i got it i got the error
 Louzy: xd
 Louzy: Can i ask questions to users here&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 Louzy: I tried to google and search but cant find anything related to this thrust exercise
 MSmits: what excercise?
 Astrobytes: thrusting exercise?
 struct: csb
 Louzy: So ive got my ship to move and go to each checkpoint the problem is the ship stays in the same checkpoint for 3 times
 BlaiseEbuth: Thrust me, I'm a pod
 Louzy: print x y thrust
 Louzy: idk what code should i put here
 struct: coordinates of the next checkpoint
 struct: replace thrust by 100
 Astrobytes: checkpoint.x  checkpoint.y 100
 Louzy: im in C
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/573605884">https://www.codingame.com/replay/573605884</a>
 MSmits: I think i did it
 MSmits: see me lose the nim
 MSmits: and then win the gaME
 MSmits: machete-style
 struct: weird game
 MSmits: I even enlarged my score a lot using score solver
 Astrobytes: nice
 Astrobytes: Louzy: do you know C?
 BlaiseEbuth: Enlarge tour score in only a week with this score solver!
 BlaiseEbuth: *your
 MSmits: took more than a week :P
 Astrobytes: Nim solvers hate this trick!!
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: unfortunately, i might be shooting myself in the foot vs other players, but we'll see, first testing cg bench vs mikla
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, you have another foot.
 MSmits: true
 Astrobytes: Hopalong Smits
 BlaiseEbuth: Always two there are, no more, no less.
 Wontonimo: hey Louzy, send a replay of your current bot in action.  Use the "share" button that looks like three blobs connected beside the gear
 BlaiseEbuth: You need a replay of his bot staying in place?
 Wontonimo: yeah, how it stays in place is telling
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: Louzy, iirc the default code has your pod steering to Y Y instead of X Y.  First the first coordinate to X
 Astrobytes: yer supposed to make 'em look for it&#160;!
 BlaiseEbuth: First the first, and then the second.
 Wontonimo: always, other than under special circumstances 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44cd694e-3f17-455d-be5c-7f1c4a07d487">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44cd694e-3f17-455d-be5c-7f1c4a07d487</a>
 MSmits: going well&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: "First things first, but not necessarily in that order." - Dr Who
 BlaiseEbuth: Dr who?
 MSmits: the doctor
 eulerscheZahl: knock knockwho's theredoctor
 eulerscheZahl: doctor who?correct
 MSmits: this is how you lure euler back into the chat
 eulerscheZahl: just got online
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: I thought you were just drawn to lame sci fi banter :P
 eulerscheZahl: had a walk in the park, slowly feeling better again
 eulerscheZahl: i know another knock knock joke
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to start
 MSmits: oh right, from the vaccine side effects right?
 MSmits: knock knock
 eulerscheZahl: who's there?
 MSmits: eh me?
 eulerscheZahl: that's lame
 MSmits: I agree, but it's your joke so...
 eulerscheZahl: my joke is leaving you clueless how to continue
 MSmits: ohhhh
 MSmits: i turned it around on you then
 Astrobytes: Germans doing jokes eh. It's all in how they tell 'em :P
 eulerscheZahl: actually knock knock jokes aren't even a thing in German
 MSmits: Germans don't knock?
 MSmits: kick your door in eh?
 Astrobytes: Are any jokes a thing in German? :P
 Wontonimo: now now
 MACKEYTH: euler, is your nick wordplay around e in German?
 MSmits: he can take it Wontonimo :0
 Astrobytes: Hey, euler actually has a good sense of humour
 eulerscheZahl: it means e
 MACKEYTH: Oh, literally? Not a pun?
 eulerscheZahl: it's German for Euler's number
 Louzy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6e50664-5978-47f7-b86c-83ee64a75c15">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6e50664-5978-47f7-b86c-83ee64a75c15</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my lack of creativity..
 BlaiseEbuth: Google say  germans klopf klopf.
 MACKEYTH: I wasn't sure how the -sche- part translated.
 eulerscheZahl: printf(next_checkpoint_x,next_checkpoint_y, "BOOST")
 MSmits: eulershce just means eulers, of euler
 Astrobytes: So you don't know C Louzy?
 BobLob: Has anyone experienced the enter key not working in the IDE on clash of code?  It just started for me.
 MSmits: euler's number I guess
 eulerscheZahl: -sche just marks the possession
 Wontonimo: yeah, BobLob, there is a fix for that.  Play a multi like Connect 4 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4</a>
 Louzy: Astrobytes no xd
 therealbeef: don't be irrational, euler
 BobLob: ok, will do.  Thanks for the assist.
 MACKEYTH: How many devs does it take to change a lightbulb?
 Astrobytes: What languages do you know Louzy? Or you have to use C for some reason?
 Louzy: I have to use C for some reason
 Astrobytes: you might wanna check the documentation for printf
 BlaiseEbuth: More seriously BobLob: alt+f4 then retry.
 eulerscheZahl: printf("%d %d BOOST\n", checkpointX, checkpointY)
 Wontonimo: you can change the language Louzy, use the dropdown at the top
 eulerscheZahl: and I just undermined astro's educational approach
 BobLob: I'll do that next time.  The connect4 thing actually worked out&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: yes but he doesn't know what the %d 's mean
 Louzy: I will know
 Louzy: And thanks
 Astrobytes: Louzy: you will need a reasonable grasp of basic C to continue
 Louzy: Thank you eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: as in the fundamentals
 Louzy: Alright will do
 Astrobytes: good luck&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Right, afk for a bit
 Louzy: Thank you
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Bring me back one too!
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits</a>
 MSmits: I got on marchetes turf I suppose, makes me more vulnerable to him, but thats ok&#160;:)
 MSmits: ohh i have an idea. I should reverse the loopy heuristic when i have control
 AntiSquid: some nice 100% there, what do you use&#160;?
 MSmits: nim solver + score solver + a heuristic to make the map have more loops and shorter chains
 AntiSquid: loopy heuristic&#160;? wow ... :D
 MSmits: score solver has a bug too, i have to fix
 MSmits: almost done, but not quite
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/uPXz2lN.png">https://i.imgur.com/uPXz2lN.png</a>
 Louzy: Does anyone know if it is possible to use the thrust without placing the position of the checkpoint&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: that's a lot of horses struct
 struct: knightthrough
 eulerscheZahl: is that a thing?
 struct: Im using ludii
 struct: to try it
 struct: yes
 Xascoria: j8n
 struct: omg knights cant move backwards
 struct: why didnt I read the rules 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jacek: knight moves forward?
 struct: L shape
 struct: but cant go back
 struct: so 4 moves in total
 jacek: hmm, is it NNable?
 struct: well
 struct: its very similar to breakthrough
 struct: but its knights
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that we need an extra contribution for this
 jacek: lets make rookthrough
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: thats solved jacek
 struct: for white
 jacek: oh?&#160;:(
 struct: im sure its easy to prove
 struct: euler we need more contributions where I just can recycle my mcts
 eulerscheZahl: no, we need less of that kind
 jacek: you mean we need to downvote one now to take some off?
 eulerscheZahl: jrke started with a rubiks cube optim. i think that idea had potential to be interesting
 eulerscheZahl: at least if you don't give a solvable cube. so the usual strategies won't apply and you have to get as close to solved as you can
 eulerscheZahl: sadly i couldn't convince him about the impossible aspect of it&#160;:(
 jacek: impossible?
 eulerscheZahl: like a cube with 10 white surfaces instead of 9
 Wontonimo: +1 (with 2 meanings)
 martinpapa69: its crazy how effective quantization is compressing nn weights. 75% compression, no noticable accuracy loss
 dbdr: 8 bits martinpapa69?
 martinpapa69: ye int8. float32-&gt;int8. hence the 75%
 MSmits: martinpapa69 do you train on 32 bit values and then compress, or use 8 bit during training?
 martinpapa69: i train with float32
 MSmits: is there any way to use 8 bit during training too?
 MSmits: or would the weights not be able to change
 MSmits: because of jumps that are too great
 martinpapa69: ye
 dbdr: yeah, I expect for training the precision helps
 dbdr: you care less about speeed and not at all about size&#160;:)
 MSmits: with a larger learning rate you might be able to solve this problem
 dbdr: but what benefit? well I guess it's easier conceptually
 MSmits: well at least it's "what you train is what you get"
 MSmits:  if you compress after, you cant be sure
 martinpapa69: basically thats the case with compression too
 MSmits: thats what i mean
 martinpapa69: there is a rly good vid about it
 MSmits: if you compress you cant be sure the bot you trained is the bot you're using
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jBmqY_aFwE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jBmqY_aFwE</a>
 MSmits: oh nice, favoriting this
 RoboStac: are you only using 8bit for transferring to cg or do you do the int maths too?
 martinpapa69: only transfer atm. quantized inference looks a bit complicated at first look
 MSmits: well i figured out what half my losses vs marchete were about. I was ignoring these objects in my score solver: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/gwfTiMe">https://imgur.com/a/gwfTiMe</a>
 MSmits: of course only Marchete makes those...
 MSmits: so i got solved scores of 86
 dbdr: :D
 RoboStac: the stockfish article is the best I've seen at showing quanitized inference doesn't have to be as complicated as some articles suggest
 RoboStac: I don't do exactly what they do but it helped a lot
 martinpapa69: how big speedup did you achieve with that&#160;?
 RoboStac: it's about double for inference speed compared to what I had before
 martinpapa69: wow thats nice
 martinpapa69: this one is the article you mentioned&#160;?
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md">https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md</a>
 RoboStac: yep
 AllYourTrees: robo what kind of nn structure are you using in C4? also do you have mcts solver in your nn mcts implementation?
 AllYourTrees: im unsure what to do next for C4. at the point where im just fiddling with hyperparamters which i hate
 struct: paramaters o.o
 struct: I only have 1
 AllYourTrees: for training a NN
 AllYourTrees: mcts params, learning params, replay buffer params, neural network structure params, noise params
 AllYourTrees: so annoying
 AllYourTrees: I WANT MY DANG FREE LUNCH
 struct: you have NN?
 AllYourTrees: yeah but i must be doing something wrong lol, haven't been able to break into top 10 yet
 dbdr: are you using cgzero?
 AllYourTrees: nope custom
 AllYourTrees: so entirely likely that there are bugs
 AllYourTrees: have a pretty small nn, not sure if thats the issue or something else
 jacek: one hots?
 AllYourTrees: nope just 63 floats
 AllYourTrees: i tried one hots but didn't make that much of a difference
 AllYourTrees: used to have conv, but implementation was slower than just straight linear
 MSmits: all bugs solved, all WR green: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits</a>  On to a different project now
 Astrobytes: gratz MSmits
 MSmits: thanks
 Astrobytes: What's next?
 MSmits: my oware project I was thinking
 Uljahn: MSmits: gratz, what was the approach?
 dbdr: gg MSmits, nice lead!
 dbdr: are you beating mikkla &gt;50%?
 MSmits: thanks, the approach is as follows
 MSmits: yes dbdr, seems so, barely over 50%
 MSmits: if i dont have anything else to do,  i use loopy heuristic
 MSmits: to make the map loopy
 MSmits: i try to nim solve every turn
 MSmits: if thats done, I try to score solve
 MSmits: if i nimsolved and not yet score solved, then if i win the nimgame, i play a anti-loopy move and if i lose the nimfame i play a loopy move
 MSmits: nim game, not nim fame :P
 dbdr: solve nim, get famous!
 Uljahn: thx
 MSmits: hehe yeah
 struct: now do it again on clobber
 struct:&#160;:)
 jacek: oO
 struct: im just trying to keep him away from bt
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: he cant do much with math in bt
 eulerscheZahl: it's all nice and fun until he plays a game that I won't mention by name
 jacek: onitama?
 eulerscheZahl: not that
 jacek: Y?
 eulerscheZahl: one that he hasn't played yet
 jacek: :notebook:
 struct: DD?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what that even is
 Astrobytes: TryAngle Catch?
 struct: dice duel
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 Astrobytes: oh
 Astrobytes: Didn't get it either lol
 jacek: :game_die:
 eulerscheZahl: obviously i don't want him to play a game where i have a high rank :zipper_mouth:
 FalINTOblivion0112: my clash of code is going down
 struct: well you are high rank in a lot of games
 dbdr: MSmits, just stop playing games then :D
 dbdr: ezpz
 eulerscheZahl: but only 1 where i'm at the top
 jacek: realm?
 eulerscheZahl: mostly because no one gave much attention to it
 Astrobytes: cotr
 Astrobytes: 1v1
 eulerscheZahl: code of the ring?
 Astrobytes: realm
 eulerscheZahl: just don't play that one smits
 eulerscheZahl: or you other evil guys who are no fun to fight against
 Astrobytes: *everyone* starts playing CotR immediately
 eulerscheZahl: that's not how it works
 dbdr: is 1v1 that different?
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't tried the 4 player version for more than 1h
 Astrobytes: It should have been one or the other tbh
 Astrobytes: not both
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. There's less players in 1v1.
 eulerscheZahl: just a port of my 1 vs 1 with some features removed as i couldn't easily make them work
 jacek: hmm why there is something about bronze when there is no bronze league
 eulerscheZahl: i agree: should not be 2 different games
 eulerscheZahl: and has some graphics glitches
 eulerscheZahl: tryangle catch also mentions bronze in the rules
 eulerscheZahl: i couldn't be bothered changing it when reality struck me
 _Royale: martinpapa69: thank you for the video link about quantization
 jacek: so its a lie, who approved that!?
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't. Judas!
 Astrobytes: Burn the traitor.
 BlaiseEbuth: No. Stop polluting when there's clean ways to kill people. :rage:
 MSmits: I'll do oware guys. Was tempted to try to do math in clobber, but I want to do something else first
 MSmits: have to finish NN projects, 3 weeks of vacation left
 eulerscheZahl: i tolerate both oware and clobber
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: tolerate?
 martinpapa69: you're welcome _Royale 
 eulerscheZahl: as in: allow without intervention?
 Astrobytes: You have Toad Approval to play those MSmits
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: got it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise i would have to create and release a new game that gets you hooked
 MSmits: no more euler, I have a lot of your stuff I have yet to try
 eulerscheZahl: i finally hardcoded CGFunge yesterday
 MSmits: unless it's better than whats already on my euler-list
 dbdr: something bookable and mathy
 dbdr: what/s your score eulerscheZahl?
 BlaiseEbuth: A toado list&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 5.9k
 MSmits: 6th, not  bad
 eulerscheZahl: once i lost my column and was too lazy to delete half of it to repair my mistake
 MSmits: dbdr, there's a cat above you on funge
 jacek: dbdr, hows france
 eulerscheZahl: the end is a bit chaotic, going in spirals
 MSmits: columns, spirals?
 dbdr: 2d programming
 eulerscheZahl: obviously it's not about primes at the top
 MSmits: is this not the prime number thingy?
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: hardcoding validators. binary search
 MSmits: the guy that beat you at cg funch is lvl 4 dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: wrote code to find a good tree. and then placed it in the grid by hand
 dbdr: I know. but great at optim
 dbdr: did a few
 eulerscheZahl: that guy is also very high at number shifting
 MSmits: oh I see
 eulerscheZahl: was first before marchete won the game
 MSmits: oh yeah thats really good then
 MSmits: that marchete really has a habit of coming out of nowhere
 eulerscheZahl: just not in contests
 MSmits: true
 jacek:  
 MSmits: who won the FB copy?
 struct: time to make a bot for all popular abstract games so I can get ready for next contest
 eulerscheZahl: still running
 MSmits: oh really
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/sogeti-codefest-2021/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/sogeti-codefest-2021/leaderboard/global</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 2 more days
 struct: pb4 is first with his bot that is rank 8 on fb
 eulerscheZahl: and not even using spells
 MSmits: well it is rank 8 on fb because other bots use spells
 struct: yeah
 struct: maybe dapo ran has a bot ready
 Astrobytes: I would assume so
 dbdr: pb4 walked but dapo ran
 MSmits: there have been FB copies before
 MSmits: did he participate then/
 MSmits: or am i confused with that weird ghostbuster game
 struct: I dont think there was a copy
 MSmits: ah ye, then it was the ghostbuster game
 dbdr: there was a kind of football game once

 BlaiseEbuth: FowBuster
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's what you mean with "copy"
 MSmits: a sponsored contest
 MSmits: there have been multiple csb copies right?
 eulerscheZahl: afaik the 3 day soccer contest was the only one reusing the FB engine until now
 BlaiseEbuth: FootBall
 dbdr: it was only 3 days?
 dbdr: I did that on from scratch in java :D
 eulerscheZahl: maybe 4. at least short
 reCurse: Yeah it was ridiculous
 eulerscheZahl: CSB had that "capture the flag" version
 Astrobytes: There was another soccer-like semi-private, but was more like CSB
 eulerscheZahl: and the recent one with only 1 pod and 360° angle
 BlaiseEbuth: SofiaLab
 eulerscheZahl: what did I miss Astrobytes?
 eulerscheZahl: soccer CSB?
 reCurse: CTF
 dbdr: Coders Stike the Ball

 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: yep
 BlaiseEbuth: in Perl you bless reference, here toad damn struct...
 eulerscheZahl: that was an original idea. and the only semi-private contest that I played
 MSmits: thats the one where they called me to ask me to apply for a job :P
 struct: gitc?
 eulerscheZahl: i remember
 eulerscheZahl: and you didn't want to move to the UK

 dbdr: ah yes, that's the one, thanks Astrobytes!
 eulerscheZahl: before that thales-2018 contest I shared a leaderboard on the forum with the exact same game
 eulerscheZahl: CG reacted by taking that leaderboard offline. So I know what game to expect :D
 MSmits: funny
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 struct: time to take a break
 struct: cya all next contest or not if its not a multi
 AllYourTrees: :wave:
 skinz11: HELLO
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that sounds like a long break. even if it's a real contest, it will be around November :o
 eulerscheZahl: farewell struct&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: whaaaat, come back soon struct
 reCurse: How do you know it's november
 eulerscheZahl: just guessing. was november last year and with 2 contests per year i think it will be around the same time

 struct: I need the break
 struct: might not be that long
 struct: But I feel like im way too invested on cg
 AllYourTrees: balance is good
 eulerscheZahl: no accusation. if you need the break, take it
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want an exhausted struct who keeps going until the big mental breakdown

 eulerscheZahl: i'm prepared for the worst
 eulerscheZahl: is it still called disappointment if you expect the worst case scenario to happen already?
 AllYourTrees: yeah you're just disappointed for much longer
 struct: well you know you were right all along
 eulerscheZahl: i announced an escape room contest even before the spring one started
 eulerscheZahl: remember my words
 Astrobytes: Pessismism has always worked for me. I'm never disappointed&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: But yeah struct, take regular breaks, don't want a real long one like last time. Look after that brain&#160;:)
 struct: yeah, thank you all, and see you all soon
 AllYourTrees: gl!!!
 Astrobytes: Take care man, see ya later
 jacek: another one bites the dust
 jacek: rebless lost due to chess, blaise lost mod rights... who else?
 FalINTOblivion0112: we will miss you struct
 FalINTOblivion0112: blaise lost mod rights what was the exact reason tho
 Astrobytes: Why isn't there a sin bin or a naughty step that we can use for jacek
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: FalINTOblivion0112: If Blaise wants to tell you he will. It's not our job to tell you.
 jacek: i bet he wanted his dignity back
 jacek: :smirk:
 reCurse: If that bin existed we could just lock it and forget the key
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh okay
 FalINTOblivion0112: thanks artrobytes
 FalINTOblivion0112: uhhh i cant type today lol
 Astrobytes: reCurse&#160;:)
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: i get the naughty step. but a sin bin? never heard about that and not sure what to imagine there
 eulerscheZahl: a bin big enough to put someone inside?
 Astrobytes: It's like a box or a special bench where you get put for fouls in some sports
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: the 2 min penalty time
 eulerscheZahl: codejam gives you 4 just for a bad submit
 Astrobytes: Ice hockey, rugby etc
 reCurse: That would lock out half of the 5%
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: ice hockey was my first thought after your explanation
 Astrobytes: Fun game, I don't mind watching that actually, after going to a few matches in Sweden
 reCurse: It's the only sport I can tolerate watching
 eulerscheZahl: i never see the puck
 jacek: thats a bold statement from a canadian
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm pretty much with you on that reCurse. I can watch rugby sometimes.
 eulerscheZahl: i prefer doing sports myself over watching
 FalINTOblivion0112: i agree
 FalINTOblivion0112: i love basketball but i dont really watch basketball
 eulerscheZahl: even missed the game where Germany won the soccer world championship
 eulerscheZahl: to my defense: i didn't really care and it started at 9pm
 eulerscheZahl: talking about the time...good night, see you
 jacek: soccer?

 reCurse: Do french people like something?
 dbdr: :D
 Astrobytes: Complaining
 BlaiseEbuth: Themself
 MichaelOverhorst: croissants. :P
 Astrobytes: Complaining is the national pasttime
 Astrobytes: *pastime
 ANONYMOUS42: I live 40 minutes from the tower
 ANONYMOUS42: but i only went there like twice
 ANONYMOUS42: kinda boring ngl
 jacek: hmhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome
 BlaiseEbuth: Same. 40 minutes with a jet
 dbdr: I like that new protocol
 jacek: :s
 FalINTOblivion0112: did you know that ';' is a thing in python
 Astrobytes: I lived in London for 17 or so years and never went to Buckingham Palace or half the other tourist places
 reCurse: That syndrome is mostly for japanese I think
 Astrobytes: Yes FalINTOblivion0112
 ANONYMOUS42: look at this guy not knowing that&#160;; is a thing in python
 reCurse: Because they have some sort of extremely idealized version of it that's somehow popular
 ANONYMOUS42: amirite guys
 ANONYMOUS42: it's just full of scammers lmao
 jacek: dont we all
 Astrobytes: No.
 jacek: oh
 Astrobytes: I mean, Paris is full of Parisians for starters :P
 reCurse: I thought Paris was pretty aggressive on the tourist scammers
 TBali: Is Stockholm syndrome the same with visiting Sweden?
 reCurse: And then I visited Rome
 jacek: oO
 ANONYMOUS42: no it's when the victims start to romanticize their abusers
 Astrobytes: Never visited Rome (or Italy for that matter)
 reCurse: Probably the most tourist-aggressive place I've ever been to
 FalINTOblivion0112: wut really
 FalINTOblivion0112: i have been to italy when i was like 6
 Astrobytes: TBali nah, Sweden is an amazing place to visit
 FalINTOblivion0112: sweden?
 Astrobytes: Yes. A Scandinavian country. You may have heard of it.
 reCurse: It's a cool place in all meanings
 jacek: ill visit it next time i get a nobel prize
 Astrobytes: Summertimes are nice and warm though. But it's hell trying to sleep.
 reCurse: Warm?
 reCurse: Oh right you're from scotland nvm
 reCurse: I didn't say anything
 TBali: beware, you can get brännvin syndrome there
 jacek: and you are from...
 ANONYMOUS42: I refuse to take nobel's blood money
 reCurse: From a place where summers get a lot warmer than both those places
 Astrobytes: reCurse: I lived in London when I went to Sweden in the summer, and we were having 36C in London
 reCurse: Ok so there's no way you can say Sweden is warm then lol
 Astrobytes: It was warmer than I expected. Pushing 30
 reCurse: That sounds rather exceptional
 Astrobytes: Not really. Depends where you are though.
 reCurse: Not in my experience
 TBali: 30F
 Astrobytes: Actually I think you're right. IT was only that one time it was warm, otherwise it was 20-25C
 reCurse: Exactly
 reCurse: And that was for a month tops if you're lucky
 Astrobytes: 2 weeks usually :D
 reCurse: Yup
 reCurse: And more in spring than summer
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure
 reCurse: I did enjoy the super long days though
 reCurse: Felt surreal
 Astrobytes: Same in Scotland, late spring early summer is summer, then it's over
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's pretty weird, had so much trouble sleeping at first but you get used to it soon enough
 reCurse: I remember going back from a party at around 3-4am and it was literally same lighting as late dusk
 reCurse: Heard winters get pretty depressing though, glad I didn't stay then
 Astrobytes: lol, in Örebro it started getting light at not long before 1am. After 1am it was essentially daytime :D
 reCurse: Oh boy
 Astrobytes: Got dark about 11 :D
 Astrobytes: Winters aren't toooo bad tbh. If you're having a s**t time of things it can be a bit depressing but it's just something you get used to
 leojean890: never went there hehe ^^I prefer going to Guadeloupe at my grandparent's during winter :P
 reCurse: I already have a tough time with the lack of daylight here in the middle of winter, so I could see how worse it gets
 leojean890: not fan of cold :P
 boterham: can somebody help me?
 Astrobytes: leojean890: lol, don't get me wrong, Guadeloupe would be my first choice if I went by ideal climate :D
 MSmits: I like our climate
 MSmits: most of the year no air conditioning needed
 boterham: can somebody help me with coding a AI
 Astrobytes: That should be changing soon MSmits
 MSmits: how so
 Astrobytes: Uhm
 leojean890: Astrobytes hehe&#160;:) some people like Norway for example for "aurores boreales" (how to say that in english xD)
 TBali: These tales of such long days and nights sounds like heresy.  How would it be possible as the Earth is flat?
 Astrobytes: "aurora borealis" :D
 MSmits: if you're referring to global warming it is not soon and when it happens, as far as i know, my country will freeze instead :P
 FalINTOblivion0112: where are you?
 MSmits: Netherlands
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh
 leojean890: long days and nights I wouldn't like much :P
 Astrobytes: TBali :rofl:
 leojean890: tried that in Norway in summer (night during 3h)
 MSmits: TBali it is because when you are closer to the ice wall, the sun is visible for a shorter amount of time
 MSmits: you know, the icewall that is around the earth disk
 Astrobytes: Yeah was like that where I was in Sweden for a few weeks leojean890
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Not soon?
 leojean890: I see^^I tried that in 2013&#160;:)
 leojean890: summer only for the moment :P
 MSmits: soon in geographical timescales
 MSmits: not soon as in I'll live to see it
 Astrobytes: You're already seeing it surely
 MACKEYTH: Tell that to Oregon, MSmits
 MSmits: whats happening in Oregon
 TBali: so global warming means ice on the rim will melt, and all these water will pour on poor elephants?
 Astrobytes: Have you not seen the incredible heat across the North Americas and Canada?
 MSmits: Astrobytes we were talking about my entire countries yearly climate changing to a degree noticable by me
 MACKEYTH: Record-destroying heat wave. Beat the maximum recorded temps by 10 deg F for weeks
 MSmits: that is not happening soon
 MSmits: i dont mean measurable by scientists. Of course it's measurable
 Astrobytes: Oh. Ours is.
 MSmits: people tend to confuse yearly fluctuations with global warming. The yearly fluctuations are larger than the overall trend. 
 MSmits: but the overall trend is of course measurable
 MSmits: but whenever theres a hot summer it's "global warming"
 Astrobytes: I'm not a stranger to the scientific method.
 MSmits: that's nonsense
 TBali: global warming is not just about extreme records, but more about the increase of yearly average, no?
 MSmits: yes TBali
 Astrobytes: No, not about hot summers. About regular extremes.
 MSmits: we're having a very mild and rainy summer this year
 MSmits: well the rain is not mild
 MSmits: the temperature is though
 TBali: but there is a perception bias for recent events as well.
 MSmits: massive flooding in our most southern province and in Germany too
 MSmits: but i have no idea if you can attribute that to global warming. People tend to do that with everything
 TBali: In my childhood there were also extreme weather every year.I more believe in long term measured trends then headlines
 Astrobytes: We are getting warmer and wetter, extreme rainfall and flooding are on the increase in most of the UK. That trend has been continuing for the past what, decade? Maybe more.
 MSmits: wetter here maybe, not sure
 MSmits: warmer, i dont know. I thought so, except for the last 2 years
 TBali: 2 year do not count. Decade yes
 MSmits: yeah but my personal experience is too inaccurate to mean anything
 Astrobytes: My town is gonna rip down a huge amount of trees to build a wall around our burn (small river) for flood protection and is currently installing additional piping for the water drainage. 
 MACKEYTH: Granted, no individual weather event is evidence of climate change by itself, but extreme events are occurring with greater frequency
 Astrobytes: Yes. You have to look globally.
 MSmits: sure, but it's different all over the world
 Astrobytes: Different?
 MSmits: it is entirely possible that some regions get more stable due to global warming
 MSmits: even if most do not
 MSmits: some places could get improved weather conditions
 Astrobytes: The unexpected thing was the North Americas and Canada being hit so bad with the heat, this was predicted for other areas.
 TBali: global warming might evne result that one region microclimate actually becomes colder
 therealbeef: global warming is the perfect enemy; intangible, undefeatable, never ending. yet you can blame everything on it, and use it to push through any policy. better than wars. &lt;/cynicism&gt;
 MSmits: many forest fires i hear
 MSmits: therealbeef first half of what you say is true
 MSmits: but it's almost impossible to push through any policy
 MSmits: because it is intanglible
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: What? In my country they try their best to ignore it.
 reCurse: So like covid?
 MSmits: it just doesn't draw the votes as well as any other issue
 Astrobytes: Yeah, quite.
 therealbeef: covid ends
 MSmits: like covid does for example, covid draws the votes
 Astrobytes: I'm currently sick and am waiting on my tests arriving.
 MSmits: climate change is low priority for most people&#160;:(
 reCurse: covid ends?
 TBali: it must
 MSmits: Astrobytes did you not already have covid before?
 MSmits: covid will not end, it will change only
 Astrobytes: It's happening far faster than they predicted MSmits. And since absolutely nothing is being done about it, it will get worse sooner rather than later.
 MSmits: yes, that is exactly what will happen
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Yes. It is 100% possible to get it again.
 MSmits: and when it does, the emphasis will still be on fighting the symptoms
 MSmits: instead of the cause
 RuderLaplace: Greetings.
 Astrobytes: Even with full vax it's possible to get it.
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: chances are just lower, especially when you're not around too many people
 MSmits: i see you on CG a lot so...
 Astrobytes: I try to limit my contact but I still have to go out and about
 MSmits: well i guess you could be chatting on CG at a party
 Astrobytes: And there are many, many maskless people
 MSmits: on a phone
 Astrobytes: No. Fk that :D
 MSmits: I think it's very hard to pick up covid when getting groceries tbh
 KiwiTae: i did go to ktv while doing code of kutulu 
 Astrobytes: You haven't been to my local supermarket
 MSmits: i hold my breath whenever someone is within 6 feet and use the scanning device when paying
 TBali: beware CG is infectious. I was exposed shortly and can't get rid of it for 2 years now
 MSmits: so i dont have any interaction
 TBali: zero interaction? hard to acomplish
 Astrobytes: We have a lot of empty shelves and a lot of angry people, that doesn't help (did someone say Brexit? :D )
 MSmits: i dont think there's a risk of getting it from touching stuff. Or at least it's very near 0
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: is this from brexit?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MSmits: did not know it was so noticable in daily life
 TBali: empty shelves? really? in UK?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 TBali: It is not the Soviet Union
 Astrobytes: We import almost everything.
 MSmits: what a dumb move was that
 TBali: Why empty. It would be just a bit more expensive because of extra taxes, sutiesn no?
 MSmits: very self destructive
 TBali: =duties
 Astrobytes: So many crops are not harvested because we expelled or disallowed all the migrant workers that picked the veggies and fruits
 Astrobytes: EU rules
 dbdr: brexit was pretty clever (from the point of view of putin)
 Astrobytes: UK disobeying
 Astrobytes: dbdr: Yes. The plan has come together very well 
 MSmits: wait so they brexited and then broke the rules also?
 MSmits: way to make it worse..
 Astrobytes: Yes. Northern Ireland protocol for a start.
 Astrobytes: Anyway. Let's drop the politics
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: well this time it was not so bad since we were in agreement :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 TBali: I am quite surprised on the empty shelves aspect. Wouldn't have thought
 MSmits: i am adapting my D&amp;B solver to solve smaller versions of the game. It's pretty easy
 MSmits: want to compare solve times with those in the papers
 dbdr: do you need a food package Astrobytes?&#160;;)
 TBali: play a bit Code a la Mode
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: if you're playing with my bot
 MSmits: take the damn plate&#160;!

 dbdr: lol MSmits
 Astrobytes: TBali: there are trucks that can't pick up from farms more than once a week. They used to have pickups every day. 3-5 day shelf life on the veg-fruits. Go figure.
 Astrobytes: dbdr: I'm good for now :D
 dbdr: good. if that changes tell us&#160;;)
 MSmits: I got 2 months worth of powder
 MSmits: just remember, mix with water, don't snort through nose
 MSmits: thats another kind of powder
 jacek: oO
 jacek: that would explain the d&amp;b progress
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: what powder is that?
 MSmits: for food shakes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://nl.jimmyjoy.com/">https://nl.jimmyjoy.com/</a>
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2012/9/12/96684.jpg">https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2012/9/12/96684.jpg</a>
 MSmits: btw the guy who runs the company is an ex-drugdealer
 MSmits: so not that far from the truth jacek
 TBali: what, more money in this stuff than what he traded earlier?
 MSmits: i think he just went around party selling ecstacy pills
 MSmits: but the company he has now supplies all around Europe
 Astrobytes: *ecstasy
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 MSmits: sorry, i never used it so i dont know how to spell it :P
 TBali: X Stasi
 Astrobytes: I've done a lot. Finished with that, was fantastic. 
 MSmits: maybe you bought his stuff too then
 Astrobytes: Not at parties in NL
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: And you never buy in parties.
 TBali: not my world, not my stuff
 Astrobytes: Anyway, moving on.
 Illedan: How did you guys end in this kinda discussion? xD
 TBali: global warming is to blame
 MSmits: wait, you were just going to tell us how to get our pills Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: TBAli: well played sir :D
 Astrobytes: That is left as an exercise to the reader MSmits
 MSmits: I see
 TBali: qed
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: lol, the endless submits of martinpapa69 continue :P
 Illedan: Where?
 Astrobytes: Guess :P
 Illedan: Sogeti?
 PebblesN: good morning everyone from Viet Nam
 Astrobytes: Oware!
 Illedan: ok
 Illedan: So last year
 Astrobytes: grats on top 5 btw Illedan
 reCurse: Illedan the sogeti country police wants to speak with you
 Astrobytes: Usual GA or did you get all fancy NN on us?
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 MSmits: ohh is illedan being an illegal alien?
 Illedan: I have trained my NN for so damn many hours and I still can't make it converge to something reasonable :P
 reCurse: I did say NN on FB was a bad idea
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Wontonimo: it's divergent, burn it!
 Illedan: I just wanted the movement reCurse
 Illedan: This game is far simpler than FB
 MSmits: does anyone remember if 2x2 was solved as 3-1 or as 1-3&#160;?
 Illedan: because the spell is less strong
 martinpapa69: thats how i monitor my training progress Astrobytes, no cpu capacity for pitting
 Illedan: *weaker
 Astrobytes: All good martinpapa69, for games I don't have a local runner for it's how I test anything since the new IDE play restrictions :D
 Illedan: BUt that damn bludger is too stronk
 Wontonimo: i miss the score arrows on the full leader board
 jacek: hm? the score arrows are there
 Illedan: Not on Sogeti
 Wontonimo: yeah, if you watch around scores that are computing , you'll see the neighbours that are modified up or down have an up or down arrow beside them
 Wontonimo: now you only see an arrow for the computing bot
 jacek: martinpapa69 you pit every generation on leaderboard?
 martinpapa69: i just submit time to time during training. i have new "generation" every few minutes
 Illedan: Test it offline?
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f534631a-9edd-478d-9986-bf13497029a8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f534631a-9edd-478d-9986-bf13497029a8</a>
 martinpapa69: zero bs
 martinpapa69: but for some reason it diverges. it reaches a peak
 martinpapa69: than it goes down
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 martinpapa69: and i think i find the reason: too big LR
 Illedan: I do action selection based on a changing env in sim, but not when picking the actual move -.-
 jacek: martinpapa69 or too small buffer?
 AllYourTrees: martin i have that same issue
 martinpapa69: ye, i increased the buffer size too as well a bit
 martinpapa69: still only 400 replays every generation
 AllYourTrees: though im running with a bigger network now and it doesn't appear to have same issue?
 AllYourTrees: whats your network size
 martinpapa69: 374, 128, 64, 64......
 AllYourTrees: hmm that seems decent, is that for oware?
 martinpapa69: yep
 martinpapa69: thats the max i can fit atm
 martinpapa69: my quantization is not working well atm
 martinpapa69: with that i can fit 374, 256, 128
 martinpapa69: idk if its necessary tho
 AllYourTrees: hmm
 jacek: 374 isnt divisable by 4 eh
 AllYourTrees: i think you want divisible by 8, but yeah
 martinpapa69: ye, lame, i should add some random features
 jacek: and here i am with 192x16 -&gt; value only
 martinpapa69: like temperature outside, my mood in a skale from 0 to 8
 jacek: oh you meant the possible inputs?
 jacek: i thought it was hidden nodes
 martinpapa69: 374&#160;: my input size
 jacek: but 14 'ones'&#160;:?
 AllYourTrees: does your NN library auto avx stuff for you?
 martinpapa69: 12 + 2 onehot, ye
 martinpapa69: my " nn lib" is like 30 lines. only dense layer
 martinpapa69: idk if it gets autovectorized
 martinpapa69: i want to move to quantization
 martinpapa69: Robo told me about this great article:
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md">https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md</a>
 Peterpanda: can anyone here give me some pointers on what is the most space efficient way to include binary data in c++ source code? so far i'm looking at base64/base85. is there anything better/close to 1:1?
 martinpapa69: i use this
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/JDanielSmith/Base16k">https://github.com/JDanielSmith/Base16k</a>
 Peterpanda: what would be the encoding ratio?
 Peterpanda: (e.g. for base64 3:4, base85 4:5)
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a1d0aa2-8632-4aa3-9068-032e1475b054">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a1d0aa2-8632-4aa3-9068-032e1475b054</a>
 martinpapa69: ahh nice pasta
 martinpapa69: 6/5 i think. at least he preallocates a 6/5 * originalsize buffer
 AllYourTrees: whats a site you can use to test your source code size
 Astrobytes: Do it in the codegolf on here
 AllYourTrees:&#160;?
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.charactercountonline.com/">https://www.charactercountonline.com/</a>
 Astrobytes: Any of the code golf puzzles, it'll give you a count
 Astrobytes: Just paste it into the IDE
 AllYourTrees: got it ty!
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: tested my solver on smaller D&amp;B boards
 MSmits: 2x2 uses about 50 microseconds
 MSmits: 3x3 uses about 0,1 seconds
 MSmits: 3x4 50 seconds
 MSmits: havent tried 4x4 as it will be hours
 MSmits: I verified the results for 2x2 (3-1, win for p1) and 3x3  (3-6, win for p2)
 MSmits: is there a table somewhere?
 MSmits: mmh got it down to 8 seconds for 3x4 but the paper does this in 1.5 seconds
 MSmits: I will try the depth priority thingy for hashing. You said this will help right Astrobytes?
 MSmits: preferring low depth results to be stored
 Astrobytes: You'll have to experiment with a replacement strategy to find what works the best
 MSmits: so far i just always replace something if necessary
 Astrobytes: Half the fun is the experimentation
 Astrobytes: So much for "done with D&amp;B" :D
 FalINTOblivion0112: D&amp;B?
 FalINTOblivion0112: Drum n' Bass
 FalINTOblivion0112: I like Drum and Bass songs on NCS
 MSmits: well i am still kinda done. But this is such an easy thing to do. The solver is there, I just wanted to compare with the "professional" solver from the paper :P
 Astrobytes: Not that DnB FalINTOblivion0112&#160;:)
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh lol
 martinpapa69: Dudes 'n' Babes
 Astrobytes: Diapers and Babies
 Ezyh: hey
 Ezyh: whatsup guys
 Wontonimo: Diapers and Babies i guess
 Wontonimo: you got either?
 Wontonimo: when are scores recalculated?
 Wontonimo: for global leaderboard, or is that down until friday also?
 MSmits: meh with depth preference still 8 seconds
 MSmits: I guess i can use symmetry
 Ezyh: I got a pfp now 
 Ezyh: wait why's it not showing here ._.
 MSmits: no diapers and babies here
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Not these days thankfully, I raised two of my sisters kids from babies though
 Ezyh: there, now its showing 
 Ezyh: astro you're a good man 
 Astrobytes: I have 'experience'
 MSmits: that he is
 Ezyh: I plan on being a badass uncle too when I grow up 
 Ezyh: teach my nephews the ways n shizz
 Ezyh: you know 
 Astrobytes: It's the only kinda way to be an uncle
 Ezyh: yeh man, ima make sure they get what I didn't have 
 Ezyh: what y'all think about this website tho 
 Ezyh: is it good for learning stuff 
 Ezyh: I just got here 
 FalINTOblivion0112: this website has become my life
 Ezyh: ow yeh
 Ezyh: want tell us why that is
 Astrobytes: Hm. Learning algorithms and techniques for sure, for the basics not so much
 Ezyh: like, you learn a lot, or is it fun, or is it the community
 Ezyh: I see
 MSmits: community is cool too
 Astrobytes: You can learn a *lot*
 Ezyh: yeh I been coding for about a week, I learnt most of the basics 
 Astrobytes: Time + engagement + self-learning
 MSmits: and fun is a personal thing. People do different things on CG
 Ezyh: astro, what's that little thing next to your name 
 Ezyh: circle thing 
 MSmits: his superpower
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Moderator badge, nothing special
 Ezyh: damn nice
 AntiSquid: pokeball
 Ezyh: btw, idk if any of y'all here lift 
 MSmits: I lifted my glass just now
 Ezyh: but I hit a 175kg squat today 
 Ezyh: I'm proud of myself lol 
 MSmits: nice one
 AntiSquid: when world championship&#160;?
 Ezyh: goal is 180 kg (400lb) 
 AntiSquid: fake abalone got approved is it any fun&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Fake Abalone?
 Ezyh: never heard of it
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/abalone">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/abalone</a> i can't stand real abalone (the sea citter) :P
 Astrobytes: Oh right, lol. Abalones are nice sliced real thin
 MSmits: with a Japanese chef knife
 Ezyh: :sunglasses:
 MSmits: I clicked on a video about these when i was bored
 Astrobytes: *a very sharp knife
 AntiSquid: japanese black smith damascus knife
 Astrobytes: I have a japanese carving knife
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't like to be near it regardless of how thin it's sliced
 Ezyh: damn nice
 Ezyh: my bro got me a butterfly knife lol to practice 
 MSmits: you're allergic AntiSquid	?
 AntiSquid: i find it gross
 MSmits: oh
 Astrobytes: I don't think butterfly knives would do you any good in a pro kitchen Ezyh. The chefs would overpower you in seconds
 MSmits: does anyone here know how to rotate bitboards cheaply?
 MSmits: for symmetry reasons
 Astrobytes: rotateBitboard(uint64_t&amp; b)
 MSmits: I always have these super expensive ways
 MSmits: lol
 Ezyh: am I the only one who sees your writing as red?
 Ezyh: and uh, its just for fun lol 
 MSmits: Ezyh
 Astrobytes: Yes, if I tag you by using your name
 MSmits: notice
 martinpapa69: first thing i found on google
 Ezyh: I like cool shizz

 martinpapa69: looks nice tho
 Ezyh: aah I see
 MSmits: thanks martinpapa69
 AntiSquid: some things i can't help but find repulsive MSmits&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2017/07/sea-snail-BAB.jpg">https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2017/07/sea-snail-BAB.jpg</a> 
 Ezyh: astrobytes test 
 martinpapa69: np
 Ezyh: @astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Ezyh passed
 Ezyh: lol how you tag someone 
 Astrobytes: You don't need the @
 MSmits: CG chat is next level
 Ezyh: ow so it worked the 1st time?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Ezyh: Msmits is this red
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: wth, how did you make it green
 Ezyh: :joy:
 AntiSquid: =&gt;@Ezyh:ya no worries it works
 FalINTOblivion0112: codingame chat is the second best chat i have been chatting in
 Ezyh: any of y'all do python btw
 FalINTOblivion0112: I LOVE PYTHON
 Ezyh: yeh fall, I just got here bro. these guys super chill 
 FalINTOblivion0112: python has become one of my essential organs
 AntiSquid: ok, i'll bite, what's the best chat then FalINTOblivion0112
 FalINTOblivion0112: unvoided guild discord server
 Astrobytes: MSmits: some of that might be avx-able
 MSmits: yeah, probably
 Astrobytes: But I think a few are fast already
 MSmits: don't think I am getting into that though. I just wanted to know why the paper thingy is faster. 
 MSmits: 2x2 and 3x3 were equally fast with my solver even though i dont use this symmetry
 MSmits: but 3x4 they are 5 times faster
 Astrobytes: Send them an email
 MSmits: no they use symmetry, it says so in their paper
 MSmits: so that's clear enough
 Astrobytes: Oh, fair. 
 Ezyh: ok ima get to some coding. time to explore this place :neutral_face:
 MSmits: just gonna finish 4x4 and then stop. 4x5 is what they managed to do and it took them 10 days
 Astrobytes: I imagine that's not a linear solving time for larger sizes
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: 3x4  -&gt; 1,5 seconds 4x4 270 seconds, 4x5 -&gt; 10 days
 MSmits: 5x5 is like a year or so, some guy from littlegolem did it
 Astrobytes: damn, fair play
 MSmits: I'm just happy my solver is on par and I am not missing any significant features. Aside from the symmetry thing, which is useless on CG
 Astrobytes: Side project perhaps&#160;;)
 MSmits: nah, i am really done now&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I never believe that statement but OK&#160;:)
 MSmits: I want to write at least 1 thing this vacation
 MSmits: was gonna do uttt, but maybe i'll do D&amp;B instead
 MSmits: plenty to share
 Astrobytes: write?
 Astrobytes: Oh write a paper
 MSmits: yeah, like a guide
 MSmits: to writing a bot for it
 Astrobytes: Hm, I think UTTT would be more beneficial for more users
 MSmits: yeah
 martinpapa69: hmm, uttt, sounds like a happy place  for nn bots
 MSmits: it's surprisingly difficult to pull off apparently
 MSmits: nr 1 is still not a NN
 Astrobytes: But don't let that stop you doing a D&amp;B one either
 MSmits: afaik. let me check
 MSmits: nope karlis o still nr 1
 MSmits: but this bot is insane
 MSmits: so strong
 MSmits: uttt leaderboard is: super strong karlis o, then 3 NNs with re curse as strongest, then 3 roughly equally strong normal mcts bots
 martinpapa69: looks kinda trivial to port nn for this tbh
 MSmits: it's not
 MSmits: because of the miniboard switching mechanic
 MSmits: you need to have a way of dealing this, to structure the input properly
 MSmits: or your NN will be weak
 martinpapa69: hmm
 MSmits: afaik re curse and jace k both have custom nn's specifically for this reason
 MSmits: dont know about robo's method
 MSmits: btw, the main reason karlis o is able to hold out is that his bot plays nearly perfectly. The NN's also play nearly perfectly
 MSmits: NN's dont have that much of an advantage over normal bots if the normal bots are already playing nearly perfectly... or at least 1 is
 martinpapa69: sure
 MSmits: I think karlis o has massive pruning in his expansion function. Lots of rules that he handcrafted
 MSmits: his random rollout is nothing special anyways, he does have good performance though
 MSmits: he did share that he has a 3k line bot
 Peterpanda: do strong uttt bots use opening books?
 MSmits: that depends on what you consider an opening book
 Peterpanda: when i look at their games they always produce the same kind of patterns
 MSmits: ahh thats not an opening book
 MSmits: thats a heuristic
 MSmits: player 1 always sends player 2 to the same board if the board is empty
 MSmits: i used to have opening books but they are fairly weak
 Peterpanda: that seems simple enough
 Peterpanda: thx for the free elo XD
 MSmits: unless you target them to specific players, which is a bit cheest
 MSmits: np&#160;:)
 MSmits: brb
 Peterpanda: i have some ideas for using offline precomputed solver results, maybe you can tell me if they sound stupid or worthwhile to try
 Peterpanda: this person <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/">https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/</a> has some pretty sophisticated solver that could be used offline to solve games after ~20plys
 FalINTOblivion0112: guys what is really minimax
 reCurse: I mean you're going for uttt so it's hard not to answer with the former
 FalINTOblivion0112: like what things can minimax be useful for
 Peterpanda: i would precompute a whole bunch and store as many as codesize allows (just boardstate, no subtree)
 Peterpanda: then use those nodes as pseudo terminal nodes for mcts to converge to
 MSmits: Peterpanda the statespace is far too large for this method I am afraid
 MSmits: you'll be able to store maybe 5-10k states this way
 MSmits: uttt is not suitable for an endgame DB
 MSmits: we have games that are
 MSmits: oware and bandas for example
 MSmits: i know that website you shared btw, i used some ideas for my expansion function
 MSmits: also, the version of uttt he solves is not exactly the one we use
 Peterpanda: ok, guess i should work on my expansion strategy than to gain more elo
 Peterpanda: he doesnt have the board count wincon right?
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: this makes it harder to solve in our case
 MSmits: his games can fairly quickly end in draw or become impossible to win for one side or other
 MSmits: locally, I can fairly easily solve from ply 22-23 in a similar amount of time, but not 20
 MSmits: I think it's even the case that his version, when fully solved, would be a draw
 MSmits: and our version when fully solved would be a win for p1
 MSmits: it's doable for p2 to counter p1 getting 3 in a row, but not to also avoid p1 having more won boards
 Peterpanda: it seems you spent a lot of time on uttt :o
 MSmits: too much
 MSmits: there's a few games i spent too much time on
 MSmits: uttt, oware, bandas, yavalath and now D&amp;B
 Peterpanda: i just started on here/first dive into ai programming/c++/optimizing code
 MSmits: welcome 
 Astrobytes: These are timespans he will never get back, but he passes on the knowledge :D
 MSmits: I try, but I should spend more time writing
 Astrobytes: Truth.
 MSmits: i mean in an article, instead of on chat
 MSmits: eulers stats already show me at 1 for typed words
 Astrobytes: Yes, many chat sermons can be condensed with the benefit of hindsight and experience
 Astrobytes: He has a tool for that?
 Astrobytes: Or that was just that day with the guessing game?
 MSmits: yeah the guessing game
 MSmits: but i think he used a tool
 reCurse: Here is maximum condensation
 reCurse: Don't uttt
 MSmits: bah, haters gonna hate
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: Hate is subjective, it doesn't apply to objective facts
 Peterpanda: where does that sentiment come frome recurse?
 reCurse: Condensation of hindsight and experience
 MSmits: he has some good reasons that he finds more important than I do
 reCurse: It's a really bad game
 reCurse: There is so much better use of your time
 MSmits: uttt is unbalanced between p1 and p2
 MSmits: so you'll get relatively many draws
 Peterpanda: pie rule could solve that no?
 MSmits: yes, but it has no pie rule
 reCurse: PIe rule is garbage
 MSmits: it's not 
 MSmits: but there are better ways, i agree
 MSmits: we agreed upon this last time
 reCurse: You have the burden of not only figuring out the best move, but also figuring out the most balanced move because the game designer couldn't be bothered to balance it properly
 reCurse: So you do two jobs
 FalINTOblivion0112: what is pie rule
 reCurse: Not fun
 MSmits: no need to rehash the discussion, your point is clear&#160;:)
 reCurse: Was he part of that conversation?
 reCurse: He/she/it
 MSmits: Peterpanda uttt is fine if you want to learn to code mcts and need a simple sim to test it with
 MSmits: but i agree that, unless you enjoy it, you should not spend too much time after you're done experimenting with this algorithm
 Peterpanda: yea i already spent some time on it (legend24 atm)
 MSmits: there arent many games where just plain mcts will do very well
 MSmits: oh thats very good Peterpanda
 Peterpanda: but after you squashed my opening book and endgame db dreams i think there is not much left&#160;:)
 reCurse: That is correct
 MSmits: 24 these days is where the nr 1 was 2 yrs ago
 MSmits: for a whole year
 reCurse: Not true?
 reCurse: He's 13 now
 MSmits: oh is he? 
 MSmits: I thought he was around 20 by now
 reCurse: Well it fluctuates because the game is so contrasted
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: Peterpanda are you looking for a game where you can do things like opening books or endgame db or both?
 Peterpanda: not really, i was mostly looking to learn mcts
 Peterpanda: and then rank up as high as possible
 MSmits: ahh ok, connect4 and bandas are 2 games where you can quickly code a good mcts and have the best algorithm for the game afaik
 MSmits: connect4 can use a smart rollout for better result
 MSmits: if you want to do away with random rollouts and use eval functions in your mcts, there's games for that too
 MSmits: it works well in oware for example
 MSmits: onitama also
 Peterpanda: sounds good, maybe i'll try those next&#160;:)
 MSmits: if you try oware, just remember it's infested with neural networks. If you get to rank 15 or so, you did great
 Peterpanda: nns have to be pretty small on CG right?
 Peterpanda: no alphazero like
 reCurse: Ironic
 MSmits: they're all azero Peterpanda, almost
 reCurse: The reason oware is infested with neural networks is because someone published a repo with cgzero
 Peterpanda: ok :P
 MSmits: azero is a method, it's not a size. It can be any size really
 MSmits: they are of course nowhere near the ones produced by the original azero, but the games are simple enough
 Peterpanda: well that was what i meant :P
 Dohmanlechx: Isn't the Temperatures test broken? It says always display the positive value if there are two numbers equally close to zero (-5 and 5, then display 5).
 MSmits: their networks can still have like 100k weights if they want to
 MSmits: just not millions
 reCurse: 192 thousand persons beg to differ Dohmanlechx
 Dohmanlechx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6722336e-5874-449d-8ae0-860eebce238c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6722336e-5874-449d-8ae0-860eebce238c</a>
 MSmits: maybe the correct answer was -5 and there was no 5 in the set
 Dohmanlechx: Oh, I just realized my mistake! Was logging absolute value in between
 MSmits: yeah
 Peterpanda: anyways, i'm going to bed. thanks for the chat msmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: gn!
 Dominic_007: gn
 swanton: why is there ablm fist in the word calsh
 ericlovesmath: I mean I see that fist everywhere in non-BLM contexts
 ericlovesmath: I think you're reading too much into it lol
 Astrobytes: hm?
 Dohmanlechx: I solved the temperatures task, time to sleep! BTW, I can recommend TIS-100 game on Steam!
 Guju: can you play clash of code but with a friend only?
 Guju: like 1v1?
 xxd: private clash
 Guju: how?
 vulca: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>
 Guju: cheers
 Dohmanlechx: Can I find all my solutions at one place?
 Astrobytes: Dohmanlechx: All the Zachtronics games are awesome tbh
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 FalINTOblivion0112: i am doing clash of code nonstop
 xxd: What are the requisites to go to the next league/division? Is there a specific place I need to be
 jacek: be above the boss
 xxd: Thanks
 xxd: How do I play the boss though?
 ViviCode: choose "test in arena", your ranking is calculated automatically
 jacek: you submit the code to arena and fight others in the leaderboard
 xxd: Yeah... I'm 156th and I don't think I got high enough to even have a chance against the boss
 ViviCode: you need to be 0th&#160;:) 
 xxd:&#160;;-;
 jacek: what game
 xxd: Legends of Code &amp; Magic
 xxd: Bronze 2&#160;: (
 ViviCode: I'm currently 143rd in wood 2 league of Ghost in the Cell, I feel ya&#160;;) 
 xxd: what is a good, introductory bot-programming challenge that isn't so overwhelming with rules
 xxd: like LoCM is pretty fun for me because i used to love hearthstone but there are so many dastardly rules (imo)
 juice0: ultimate tic tac toe is relatively straightforward, at least out of the handful i've tried so far
 FalINTOblivion0112: YES
 FalINTOblivion0112: top 2000 clash of code
 FalINTOblivion0112: 1000 more to go
 ViviCode: grats!
 FalINTOblivion0112: thank you
 FalINTOblivion0112: the codingame community is awesome
 FalINTOblivion0112: who needs a girlfriend when codingame is a thing
 ViviCode: lol
 xxd: i love clash of code but i think i've plateau'd at ~120th
 FalINTOblivion0112: well im around the 1900's
 FalINTOblivion0112: not even close to the 1000's
 xxd: When creating a contribution, when should Variable style and Constant style be used?
 KatMan911: if you want to annoy the fuck out of many people, make up the longest, most descriptive, var names possible
 xxd: But my question was when to use Variable vs Constant
 KatMan911: ah. I'd just follow accepted rules for that particular language
 FalINTOblivion0112: you use variable when the value varies and constant if the value stays fixed
 KatMan911: yeah, which is pretty much what the rules are normally&#160;:)
 xxd: yeah, but i think i've seen conflicting usage in clashes so i got a bit confused
 10Casac: wouldn't it be for describing the variables passed as input? The bottom of the statement help shows examples when creating. Not sure about constants, usually puzzles don't use them.
 xxd: I see
 xxd: I don't see the styles render in my private contribution though so I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly...
 10Casac: when you're done  you can test in IDE and it renders it for you
 KatMan911: did the site change its behavior recently for anyone? I don't see the mouseover popups for users anymore, all of a sudden.
 FalINTOblivion0112: same! can the codingame mods do anything about that?
 ZarthaxX: its just broken
 ZarthaxX: will be fixed eventually
 Wontonimo: friday, from what i hear
 Wontonimo: until then, we are all equal
 Wontonimo: mods are just regular users who have been trusted with the ability to kick.  they don't have anything more than that I believe.
 ZarthaxX: i can just look up your profile :P
 Wontonimo: noooooooo
 ZarthaxX: right
 Wontonimo: okay, take a quick look
 ZarthaxX: i already did :P
 Wontonimo: it's totally normal because we are both wearing socks
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: the heck
 KatMan911: Wow. All this intimacy and lovey-dovey crap. I'm just here for some hard CoCs.
 Wontonimo: what are you coding these days ZarthaxX&#160;?
 Wontonimo: I finally shook my apathy away and ported my UTTT to C4.  I'm happy enough with it.
 Wontonimo: KatMan911, step away from CoC and come join the cool kids battle bots against eachother
 Wontonimo: Check out these peoples bots that are programmed to race around the checkpoints <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/573676032">https://www.codingame.com/replay/573676032</a>
 Wontonimo: they are not even slowing down properly to make a turn!  Surely you can beat them KatMan911!
 Wontonimo: come join the bot battles!
 ZarthaxX: i havent been coding anything
 ZarthaxX: busy studying
 ZarthaxX: oh btw finished that course, got a 9/10
 ZarthaxX: how is that C4 bot?
 Wontonimo: NICE&#160;!
 Wontonimo: that was a crazy week (or was it 2, i forget)
 Wontonimo: i'm happy with my 17th place in C4.  It's just MCTS + solver.  Nothing "special" specific to C4.
 ZarthaxX: one week
 ZarthaxX: but was an easy exam anyway
 ZarthaxX: hell yeah 17 :O
 Wontonimo: but i did optimize the snot out of MCTS and the C4 rules, using uint64 for the state
 ZarthaxX: i want to go back to bots&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: :D thanks
 ZarthaxX: but i really want to do this final exam
 ZarthaxX: oh uint64 in C4 is amazing
 ZarthaxX: the operations to find a win are awesome
 ZarthaxX: bits ops i mean
 Wontonimo: yeah, struct said it was possible and gave a very small snip of code to get available next moves
 Wontonimo: so i decided to actually puzzle over it 
 Wontonimo: before that I was going to use 128
 ZarthaxX: oh cool
 ZarthaxX: i thought this C4 version had modified width &amp; height
 Wontonimo: it's 9x7, so first in 63bits.
 Wontonimo: another reference i read on bitboarding such games is to put a boarder around the game so when you shift and &amp; the board to 
 Wontonimo: find pieces in a row you don't end up wrapping around
 Wontonimo: ah, the trick here is to blank out all the illegal wrapped around bits of the shifted board when &amp;'ing it with the original
 Wontonimo: well, that's what i thought the "trick" was, and that's how i did it.  maybe there's a sneaker way.
 Wontonimo: there has to be, because struct has many times more rollouts than i do
 ZarthaxX: oh 63 bits, nice
 ZarthaxX: but if you add that border thingie you cant fit it in 64 bits
 Wontonimo: yeah, so i dont
 ZarthaxX: you could just ask struct :P
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 Wontonimo: ahah, yeah i could
 Wontonimo: it was very rewarding to work it out myself
 ZarthaxX: bit tricks are always satisfying to discover
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Wontonimo: i don't think i could go back to arrays when working with such small boards.
 Wontonimo: the bots that beat mine set up traps, such that in a column they have two wins in a row.  If they build up to the first and i block, they win with the second
 Wontonimo: very consistantly
 Wontonimo: i have no "special" code to try that
 ZarthaxX: did it just emerge??
 ZarthaxX: you are missing the last part, play against your bot and get demolished haha

 UZUHAMA: Is there a way to reset my progress in a league-based game?
 UZUHAMA: i want to start again from wood league
 Wontonimo: you have to make a new account
 Wontonimo: it's sad
 UZUHAMA: oh no
 Wontonimo: yeah
 UZUHAMA: I forgot all about tictactoe&#160;;-;
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 UZUHAMA: Ultimate Tic-Tac-Tpe
 UZUHAMA: I totally forgot all of the stuff'
 UZUHAMA: Dang
 Wontonimo: yeah, i know uttt.  it seems like such a non sequitur though
 Wontonimo: is that want you want to start back at wood&#160;?
 UZUHAMA: yeah
 Wontonimo: why?
 UZUHAMA: I looked at my previous code, and I recognize nothing
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah, that happens to me all the time
 UZUHAMA: comments doesn't help..
 UZUHAMA: Also code sucks
 Wontonimo: have strong words with the author
 Wontonimo: let them know how you feel
 UZUHAMA: hahaha
 UZUHAMA: Author says sorry
 Wontonimo: what algo was it (trying to be)
 UZUHAMA:&#160;:(
 UZUHAMA: it's very messy
 UZUHAMA: hard to understand
 Wontonimo: yikes
 UZUHAMA: to summarize
 Wontonimo: is it bitboard?
 UZUHAMA: yeah
 UZUHAMA: full of dots
 UZUHAMA: You told me to use it?
 UZUHAMA: right?
 UZUHAMA: i think i remember that
 Wontonimo: dots?  that doesn't sound like me
 Wontonimo: what kind of dots?
 UZUHAMA: .
 UZUHAMA: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05f22599-77dd-480c-875a-323a74a4ec6d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05f22599-77dd-480c-875a-323a74a4ec6d</a>
 Wontonimo: no, i'd never recommend such rediculousness 
 UZUHAMA: yeah, you told me to use it, but I didn't
 UZUHAMA: I just did it my way
 UZUHAMA: sad
 Wontonimo: i'd recommend stuff like this
 UZUHAMA: Should've listned to you
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/14f00eb1-df4d-4aa6-b29f-cadcd17960c0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/14f00eb1-df4d-4aa6-b29f-cadcd17960c0</a>
 Wontonimo: and this
 UZUHAMA: yeah that thinng I remember
 Wontonimo: return 0b111111111 ^ taken;
 UZUHAMA: what's that
 Wontonimo: bitboard stuff
 UZUHAMA: but bitboard wouldn't work in 9x9 grid, would it?
 Wontonimo: here is a full example of 3x3 bitboard <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a>
 Wontonimo: yeah, it does for me
 Wontonimo: i used nine 3x3 bitboards for the smaller boards
 UZUHAMA: oh
 Wontonimo: which use exactly the code I had for wood league
 Wontonimo: and a special 3x3 board that has rules for ties and stalemate and win-by-majority
 Wontonimo: so ten 3x3 boards.
 UZUHAMA: :drooling_face:
 UZUHAMA: my brain goes dead
 Wontonimo: each board has 2 16 bit ints.  So that's 20 16 bit ints, plus a couple for ties and stalemates 
 Wontonimo: it took me a few days to code up the 3x3s to work together smoothly.  it's not a 30 min project
 UZUHAMA: i really don't know what to say
 UZUHAMA: overwhelmed by knowledge
 Wontonimo: oh
 UZUHAMA: ugh ok so 
 Wontonimo: UTTT is a very technical challenge
 UZUHAMA: it looked easy...
 Wontonimo: something like Spring Challenge 2021 or Botters of the Galaxy you can get  further using if/else 
 UZUHAMA: I have a question:raised_hand_tone1:
 jrke: yeah SC21 has lot of things to mine just with if/else
 UZUHAMA: What does it mean by each board having 2 16 bit units?
 Wontonimo: for a 3x3 board you can keep track of all the positions that 1 player has using a 16bit integer
 UZUHAMA: 0b000000000 is a 16 bit?
 Wontonimo: look at the first 9 binary bits of a 16bit integer000 000 000
 jrke: for 3x3 you need 9bits but there is no such 9 bit int so you need 16 bit int one for each player so 2 16 bit int
 UZUHAMA: oh
 Wontonimo: yeah
 UZUHAMA: and what about other 7 digits?
 UZUHAMA: You can just get rid of it like that?
 Wontonimo: hide secret info in them for fun
 Wontonimo: no, just ignore it
 jrke: not to use them or just some other info if you want
 UZUHAMA: haha
 Wontonimo: it's wasted
 UZUHAMA: mmmm
 UZUHAMA: ok I began to understnad a bit now...
 UZUHAMA: oof
 Wontonimo: first follow this advice, then after you are at the top 50 in legend, then think of how you can reuse those other bits
 jrke: now understand 16bits :grimacing:
 Wontonimo: if player 1
 Wontonimo: 010 010 000
 Wontonimo: and player 2 is001 000 010
 Wontonimo: then you can find all spaces that are used via
 Wontonimo: used = player1 | player2
 Wontonimo: used will be011 010 010
 Wontonimo: all in 1 operation, no loops
 Wontonimo: to find all the available positions
 Wontonimo: available = 111111111^used
 Wontonimo: 100 101 101
 Wontonimo: again, just 1 operation
 Wontonimo: very fast
 UZUHAMA: ^ means substract?
 Wontonimo: ^ means XOR
 UZUHAMA: ohh
 UZUHAMA: reverse thingy
 jrke: btw wontonimo can minimax give me legend in UTTT?
 Wontonimo: i don't know.  maybe with NN
 Wontonimo: hey jrke!  
 jrke: hey hey
 Wontonimo: :taco: jrke
 UZUHAMA: Oh yeah I love your new bot
 Wontonimo: well that sucks.  where is antiwonto?
 Wontonimo: hi antiwonto?
 UZUHAMA: it's still sleeping?
 jrke: nice name btw `antiwonto` :grinning:

 KubkoFrano: yeah I got it, thanks a lot man
 Thorcode: np
 Darleanow: I got a question , are checkpoints numberised&#160;? I mean by this, that checkpoint 1 is associated to something, etc
 Darleanow: in order for the AI the go on the first one it should right&#160;?
 5DN1L: You give them numbers yourself
 Darleanow: because i want make in sort that it will boost when the distance is the max
 Thorcode: you will need it until reach gold XD
 5DN1L: in the lower leagues you aren't given all the checkpoint positions at the beginning
 Darleanow: wdym thorcode&#160;?:D
 5DN1L: you will have to keep track of them yourself when you go to each checkpoint for the first time
 5DN1L: in the Gold league they're given to you at the beginning
 Darleanow: oh okayyy
 Thorcode: just learn to drift Darleanow 
 Darleanow: okay but i don't understand what u mean by this x), i will play the car game&#160;!!
 Darleanow: okay i do maybe have something, the more speed you have, the further you will go
 Darleanow: and the wider the angle will be
 Darleanow: but the less speed you will lose
 Darleanow: depending on the angle

 Darleanow: what does sending to IDE means&#160;?
 5DN1L: means your existing code will be replaced
 Darleanow: by what ?x)
 5DN1L: by the code you have in your history
 5DN1L: if you decide to send it
 5DN1L: so let's say you have submitted Code 1 to the arena, then you make some changes to your code but do not submit it (Code 2)
 5DN1L: If you look for Code 1 in the history and click Send to IDE, then your Code 2 will be replaced by Code 1
 5DN1L: i.e. all your changes are gone
 Darleanow: yeah, bad idea
 5DN1L: you're back to Code 1
 5DN1L: bad idea unless that's what you want to do
 Darleanow: okay i see thanks man&#160;!!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 DaNinja: send to IDE when looking at Last Battles does not affect your code
 DaNinja: it just sets opponent and game setting
 5DN1L: So there's Send to IDE in code history
 5DN1L: and Send Game Parameters in replays history
 5DN1L: those are two different things
 5DN1L: Send Game Parameters to IDE*
 Darleanow: I'm so bad, this is frustrating
 C26_1: I'm gonna paste this link every day in the afternoon to share my contribution, make sure to comment and try to code the solution.
 Thorcode: lmao
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(

 Thorcode: ah he's not rlly good at eng XD
 Darleanow: guys, is there any games that are easier than mad pod&#160;?

 StraumliPerversion: well that's one thing I won't miss about this chat, talking about pods a million times
 Hackker: yeah
 Hackker: pod is ez
 Darleanow: ok the descent is too hard for me
 Hackker: so that many beginner coder would talk about it
 5DN1L: Darleanow you can read the hints on the left
 Hackker: you can see the solution
 Hackker: to learn from it
 Darleanow: yes i did, but i don't like to cheat&#160;:'(
 Wontonimo: hi
 antiwonto: [auto] 'hi' was defined as ' A common salutation for those who are short of words ' by Wontonimo
 Darleanow: Hello wontonimo&#160;!
 Hackker: also a hint for the des is
 Wontonimo: hey Darleanow :wave:
 Darleanow: i went back to mad pods
 Hackker: make a list to contain all the mountain height
 Hackker: then print the index of the maxium element in that list
 Darleanow: is there any way to reduce the gliding of the pod&#160;?
 Darleanow: yeah hackker i saw the answer, but didnt ctrl+c ctrl+v on the page so i can validate it
 Darleanow: I'll go back to it after
 Wontonimo: this site may be too advanced for you atm Darleanow.  It's not really a beginner site.  Don't go away, but definitely try using other sites to learn
 Hackker: like w3school
 Wontonimo: turn down the thrust and you'll glide less
 Darleanow: i did turned down

 Darleanow: like this&#160;!
 Darleanow: bronze UwU
 Darleanow: but sometimes i'm missing checkpoints bc i glide too much
 datu12: Hey all for the problem mars lander
 datu12: do I just need to rewrite a single part of it?
 Hackker: omg I can't see the bot at the bronze league
 Hackker: 35 pp beated it
 Darleanow: ranked 13k atm
 5DN1L: datu12 you just need to rewrite the part after reading the variables
 5DN1L: Darleanow anything up to your second if-block is rendered useless by the line "thurst = 0"
 5DN1L: is that your intention?
 Krait_MkII: anyone done the shield smashing thing&#160;?
 datu12: yow i just got lost in which part hey
 datu12: like in the loop section?
 Hackker: what lander?
 Hackker: ep 1 or 2?
 5DN1L: datu12 read the hints on the left if you're in episode 1
 derjack: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] derjack has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 81 taco. derjack now has 15 taco
 Automaton2000: but they are not the same
 Automaton2000: it should be a bug
 5DN1L: datu12 and you're supposed to revise the code below the comment which says "write an action"
 StraumliPerversion: :taco: derjack
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry StraumliPerversion but you are too new.  Get someone to give you tacos first
 struct: :taco: StraumliPerversion
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry struct but you can only award tacos once per day
 Hackker: yeah
 Hackker: i solved the mars lander 1
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 Wontonimo: how?
 Darleanow: GUYYYYYYSSSS
 Darleanow: I WENT FIRST BEFORE TIMER
 Darleanow: AND IM STILL BRONZE
 Darleanow: THE GAME HATES ME FR
 5DN1L: and no all caps please
 Darleanow: sorry fam&#160;!

 Darleanow: even though i was ahead of the boss
 Darleanow: and ranked #2
 Hackker: chill out
 Darleanow: i'm chill&#160;:) just explaining 
 5DN1L: what's the time in your place now

 5DN1L: Remember: even longer wait for higher league promotions
 Hackker: well solve a puzzle to kill time XD
 Darleanow: god damn :o
 Ismaellamgadar: wth i dont get episode 1 of mars lander who can help
 5DN1L: read the hints on the left
 5DN1L: Ismaellamgadar
 Hackker: or better read the instruction carefully
 Ismaellamgadar: which variable shows the distance between lander and surface
 Hackker: i think you won't need that
 Hackker: and the surface is0
 Hackker: you already have your xy
 Ismaellamgadar: aight thx
 Darleanow: nooo hacker won&#160;:'(
 Darleanow: lucky collides
 Hackker: np
 5DN1L: Darleanow no worries
 5DN1L: you won't be pushed back to bronze again

 jacek: then dont try java :no_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: the huge problem in C# is it's "too wordy"C#9 allows to code without class and Main() function

 eulerscheZahl: while java only has the diamond syntax

 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry eulerscheZahl2 but you are too new.  Get someone to give you tacos first
 NewCoder09: :taco: eulerscheZahl
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry NewCoder09 but you can only award tacos once per day
 eulerscheZahl: oh, wonto was more thoughtful than i expected
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl2
 eulerscheZahl: deleted manually?

 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 91 taco. jacek now has 90 taco
 Automaton2000: i already have a bot for that
 Automaton2000: if you didnt do that
 eulerscheZahl: i can build a chain today (euler =&gt; euler2 =&gt; euler3 =&gt; ...) and benefit tomorrow
 Wontonimo: good luck with that
 eulerscheZahl: 91 for automaton? how? did that bot also give tacos once?
 Astrobytes: y=0xFEED*0xBEEF
 Wontonimo: i think *someone* pretended to be that bot
 Astrobytes: hmph, no hex?
 Wontonimo: and no y
 Astrobytes: ah
 Wontonimo: just x
 Wontonimo: x+7 = x +7
 antiwonto: [auto] x = 0
 eulerscheZahl: sagemath is much better than that. and wolframalpha beats antiwonto by miles
 jacek: x = x^2
 antiwonto: [auto] x = 0
 Astrobytes: lol, one would hope so!
 eulerscheZahl: the opposite would be impressive
 eulerscheZahl: a random chatbot competing with state of the art math software
 Astrobytes: CG mathbot
 Wontonimo: i work on it a bit to try and get it to return multiple solutions if there were some ... but it was kludgy beyond belief
 Astrobytes: You could call it NumeroHero
 eulerscheZahl: x = users['eulerscheZahl'].tacos += 100
 Wontonimo: x = x + 2
 antiwonto: [auto] x = end of the universe

 NewCoder09: Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: yeah
 NewCoder09: How has your day been so far
 Wontonimo: good thanks
 Wontonimo: and you&#160;?
 NewCoder09: Good
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: how have you been jacek?
 jacek: im fine
 Wontonimo: good
 NewCoder09: Earlier i ranked 33 in mad pod racing on wood league 2
 Wontonimo: oh, we can get you higher than that!
 jacek: :tada:
 NewCoder09: now im 2,143rd
 NewCoder09: :sad:
 Wontonimo: share a replay
 NewCoder09: :cry:
 NewCoder09: of what
 NewCoder09: Madpod
 Wontonimo: yeah
 NewCoder09:&#160;?
 NewCoder09: Which one
 jacek: yes
 Wontonimo: i'm not sure how to say this any other way ... 1 random replay
 NewCoder09: ok 
 xxd: for bot programming games, how do you get a message to appear on the game screen?
 NewCoder09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/610564863">https://www.codingame.com/replay/610564863</a>
 xxd: Oh nvm
 xxd: shoulda RTFM fully
 jacek: no. just ask in the chat
 NewCoder09: how do i share the code 
 Wontonimo: okay, so you are correctly targeting the X and Y and thrust 100
 Wontonimo: now you just need to check if abs(angle to checkpoint) &gt; 90
 Wontonimo: and if so to use thrust = 0
 jacek: i dont thrust you
 Wontonimo: :O
 NewCoder09: where would i input "abs(angle to checkpoint) &gt; 90" using c++
 Wontonimo: that's english i sent you, not code. you need to translate it into working c++ code
 xxd: with an MCTS, how would I get the "chance of winning" for debug output
 NewCoder09: oh ok
 xxd: i tried doing w_i / n_i but I feel like that's wrong
 Wontonimo: it depends what w_i is
 jacek: thats basically it is
 struct: score/visits?
 xxd: yeah
 Wontonimo: is it from 0 to 1, or -1 to 1
 Wontonimo: or something else
 xxd: my scoring system uses -1 and 1 
 xxd: but for some reason score/visits works and not (score+visits)/visits
 Wontonimo: then 0.5*score/visits + 0.5
 NewCoder09: would that be " if nectcheckpoint angle . 90 or nextchecpointangle &lt; -90 then thrust = 0 
 xxd: by "works" i mean the output falls in between [0,1]
 NewCoder09: else thrust =100 end if print x y thrust"
 NewCoder09:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yeah NewCoder09, but in proper c++
 NewCoder09: ok 
 NewCoder09: hold up
 xxd: Oh cool. 0.5*(score/visits)+0.5 works
 xxd: i guess i had the right idea with (score+visits)/visits, just didn't divide by 2
 CatboyCodes: sup
 xxd: thanks wonto
 Wontonimo: anytime xxd&#160;!
 Wontonimo: what are you using mcts for&#160;?
 xxd: I just wanted to add some output for my C4 bot
 xxd: since i'm demoing MCTS to my school computer science club today
 Wontonimo: oh cool&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: 0.5*(score/visits)+0.5adding a 0.5 as a constant? looks redundant to me
 NewCoder09: xxd your at school too?
 Wontonimo: if you can make it interactive you can show that it will DESTROY THEM
 eulerscheZahl: interactive version: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg">https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg</a>
 jacek: [-1,1] to [0,1] is x/2 + 0.5 no?
 xxd: yea
 eulerscheZahl: line 100 in the link above is wrong, should use rollouts of parent instead of root
 jacek: so you get an F for that
 Wontonimo: sure eulerscheZahl, you could rearrange it to be 0.5*(score/visits + 1)
 xxd: how would you access the parent from the child?
 jacek: in my code a node has pointer to parent
 xxd: are you talking about N being # rollouts of root 
 struct: o.o
 eulerscheZahl: just replace N by n in my snippet
 Wontonimo: are you using that eulers snippet or your own code xxd&#160;?
 xxd: i'm probably going to use eulers for C4
 struct: my mcts is just euler code
 xxd: since TTT is too trivial, UTTT is too arcane
 xxd: and the C4 impl on CG needs you to input the board 
 xxd: which is really annoying
 eulerscheZahl: you really took that inefficient thing struct?
 struct: ofc not 
 Astrobytes: of course not lol
 xxd: also: how do I build this file on macOS
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get sarcasm&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: It's not easy being German I guess&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: install netcore
 eulerscheZahl: or run it on tech.io
 eulerscheZahl: it's not easy being me. real life friends also made fun about me not understanding irony
 jacek: well being on spectrum is job requirement for it, no?
 Astrobytes: lol, it's one of those things. Not everyone gets everything. You're better with numbers so nothing to worry about
 NewCoder09: eulerscheZahl none of my irl friends even know how to code :joy:
 jacek: neither do you :V
 Astrobytes: :fire:
 eulerscheZahl: story from years ago. other student changed a + for a - while i was gone for a few seconds. i came back, set down, looked at the screen and had a feeling that something is off
 xxd: :skull:
 Astrobytes: I was waiting for more
 jacek: te suspense
 eulerscheZahl: oh. i quickly spotted and fixed that line of code
 eulerscheZahl: end of story
 Astrobytes: Thanks. That was a real gem.
 eulerscheZahl: sarcasm?
 Astrobytes: You got it! :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: got the message, i'll show myself out
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: oO
 5DN1L: oh i thought the moral was either lock your computer or lock other students when you're away
 Astrobytes: Or: never leave your desk
 5DN1L: yup, that too :D
 Girlperson: im on the couch at school in my classroom
 xxd: I compiled with `csc $file` but how do I run it now?
 Astrobytes: sounds like a job for a search engine xxd&#160;;)
 xxd: I tried
 Girlperson: HEYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
 jacek: csc?
 Girlperson: whattssssuppppppppp???????
 jacek: oh c# compiler?
 xxd: yeah
 xxd: I compiled it to an exe and I want to run it on macOS
 Girlperson: hi people
 struct: you dont need to say hi 3 times
 xxd: I can use `mono` but apparently its deprecated in the sense that .NET is the future of C#?
 jacek: afaik .net is also available to linux now?
 Astrobytes: it is yes, for some time
 Girlperson: @struct ok lol
 Wontonimo: how did you find this site Girlperson&#160;?
 Wontonimo: the text is red if someone uses your name.  it does't mean anything btw
 Girlperson: CODINGðŸ˜‘
 Girlperson: and ik
 Girlperson: thx tho
 Wontonimo: what's your language of choice
 Girlperson: wdym?
 Girlperson: do u mean language i speak?
 Wontonimo: coding lang
 Sarstan: Alright, time to get this sorted out. I've got an entityId. Its correlated X and Y, etc. How do I tell the system if it's entityId A, then do something with X and Y for that entityId's values?
 Girlperson: Wontonimo idk
 xxd: .___.
 Wontonimo: probably this site isn't for you then Girlperson.  This is more geared for people who already know functions, arrays, loops, and some basic data structures
 Astrobytes: if entityId equals A, then entityA.x = someX&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Girlperson: quit DMing me
 xxd: if entityId == A, do something with entityId.X and entityId.Y&#160;?
 Wontonimo: take a break Girlperson.  I've kicked you for a few minutes
 Wontonimo: go learn basics, then feel free to come back
 Astrobytes: I sense it's a troll
 Wontonimo: the force is strong in this one
 xxd: yeah; username gives it away
 Wontonimo: they followed antiwonto so they must have good taste :P
 Sarstan: That's definitely helped. But in doing entityId == "A", I'm getting an error that == can't be used for strings.
 Wontonimo: what lang?
 Sarstan: C#
 Wontonimo: .equals( )  maybe
 Astrobytes: possibly the equals method yeah
 xxd: you should reference a C# quick start guide or the documentation
 Astrobytes: since you're comparing String objects
 xxd: .Equals() would be it
 xxd: C# and their weird case conventions
 Astrobytes: Java to C#: UpperCaseEverything
 Sarstan: Oh, I'm dumb. It's giving 1 for player and -1 for enemy. And I'm searching for player instead of 1.
 Sarstan: So essentially when you find an element in the string, it will reference that particular element when looking at other values?
 Astrobytes: the equals method?
 Wontonimo: let me know if this gperson is bothering you
 Wontonimo: :hammer:
 Wontonimo: it's ready
 Sarstan: No, like when you have all these inputs and you have something like unitId. It can pull up the related object's values too.
 Sarstan: So like I have a list of unitId, faction, unitType, health, positionX, positionY, etc. 
 Wontonimo: isn't that just an array? 
 Sarstan: Seems like it. I'm still at a loss in wrapping my head around arrays properly.
 Astrobytes: yeah, you can retrieve the instance of the object with the attributeId that you're looking for
 Wontonimo: practice arrays.  it's a really useful concept in programme
 Sarstan: I know you can store values in an array like ratings of 3, 5, 2. But then trying to match them to a separate value throws me off.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I would focus on learning those kind of things first before trying to move further
 Astrobytes: Kind of essential knowledge that you then build on
 Sarstan: I had a feeling. But I'm confused how that's different from a list.
 Wontonimo: it's spelt differently
 Astrobytes: :D
 c0r3dump: An array is typically static in size, while a list is extensible.
 Sarstan: I had a friend I mentioned what I was trying to do and he made it sound like it's not an array I'm after.
 Wontonimo: what language&#160;?
 Astrobytes: C#
 Sarstan: C#, but he's more familar with Java I think.
 Astrobytes: In that respect they are both pretty similar
 Wontonimo: in java there is something called a Map, and specific implementations like a HashMap, that allows you to make an arbitrary association between a key and a value
 Wontonimo: in other languages this is called an associative array, or a hash
 Astrobytes: or a map
 Wontonimo: a map (aka hash, associative array) is very useful and definitely something you should put on your learning to-do list after you get a firm grip on lists (aka arrays)
 Sarstan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6b8b17af-4bed-4345-9012-0fca9ff7b1b7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6b8b17af-4bed-4345-9012-0fca9ff7b1b7</a>
 Wontonimo: use a struct for that
 struct: you use data structures
 Wontonimo: or a class
 Sarstan: Sounds like another item on my checklist to look into.
 struct: I think class is more common in C#
 Sarstan: Thanks for pointing that out though. I think I'm thinking too hard on this stuff. Like wondering how to store several types of of information into an array, which sounds like I'm just not looking at it right.
 Wontonimo: is c# your lang of choice?
 Sarstan: Yes.
 Astrobytes: I strongly recommend following some C# or just computer science fundamentals to get a grasp on the foundations
 Wontonimo: ah.  see if you can find an intro tutorial on it that covers arrays, functions, and basic classes
 Sarstan: I might go to Java though. Have a new buddy who works in Java.
 Sarstan: I've gone through Codecademy's basic tutorial and noticed I struggled hard on arrays.
 Astrobytes: You'll be able to do both when you get the basics down
 Astrobytes: Right, look for tutorials on that then. And also refresh yourself on how the language works (ie. objects and such)
 Wontonimo: and don't just go through the tutorial once.  repeat going through it ever week until you can do it without googling answers or looking at hints
 Astrobytes: ^
 Sarstan: Sure thing. Nice to get some guidance on that.
 c0r3dump: Something I like a lot are cheatsheets. Hopefully this one can be of use to you: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-reference">https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-reference</a>
 Wontonimo: noone would suggest reading about throwing a ball, then throwing just a couple times until it leaves your hand once.  But for some reason coding tutorial sites seem to leave people thinking that's how it works with coding
 StraumliPerversion: everyone is so friendly today
 Astrobytes: A lot of them, yeah. Worthless content.
 Sarstan: c0r3dump nice! A visual helps a lot.
 Wontonimo: oh, i just now noticed your name is core-dump.  nice!
 Sarstan: I noticed programming tutorials like to leave you high and dry with a "google it" mentality. I appreciate not just handing the answer over. But you need that to get a feel for what you're looking for.
 Sarstan: Nevermind reading dry Microsoft documention.
 Astrobytes: well, a nudge in the right direction helps. And a good solid tutorial that doesn't leave you googling without knowing what you're doing.
 Astrobytes: Docs and references are useful, not initially, but very useful once you know the language(s) better
 StraumliPerversion: easiest for me is to fine a snippet of code that runs with all the basics in it
 Sarstan: Definitely. It's how I first learned HTML years ago. Just grabbed from somewhere and played with it until I got it how I wanted. Was able to build simple sites from scratch after a while.
 jacek: HTML is programming language :rofl:
 StraumliPerversion: Coming from a country who stole Indonesia's flag but hangs it upside down...

 NewCoder09: this is word for word of what it says
 Wontonimo: NewCoder09 , i think this site is too advanced for you.  From working with you I'd say you should do a tutorial on basics, like variables, if/else, functions, and loops
 NewCoder09: no 
 5DN1L: you miss a right bracket there
 NewCoder09: im good with puzzles
 Wontonimo: change thisif ((next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 90) || (next_checkpoint_angle &lt; -90) {to this
 Wontonimo: if ((next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 90) || (next_checkpoint_angle &lt; -90)) {
 NewCoder09: im good with looping and all the puzles just not ai coding
 5DN1L: NewCoder09 the console tells you exactly what the issue is :wink:
 Wontonimo: it's not ai coding, it's just if/else

 nulte:&#160;??
 nulte: math
 Scarfield: there is a risk of dropping the awarded tacos i guess
 Wontonimo: the 10 was hardcoded text.  i've changed it to be the amount awarded
 nulte: so its random now?
 Wontonimo: i guess there are tacos on the floor at this moment
 Wontonimo: no, it is the min( givers taco count , receivers taco count + 1 , 10)
 nulte: ah
 StraumliPerversion: :taco: Scarfield
 antiwonto: [auto] StraumliPerversion has awarded Scarfield 10 tacos. Scarfield now has 43 taco. StraumliPerversion now has 16 taco
 Astrobytes: Who will help me rake those tacos?
 Scarfield: om nomnom
 Wontonimo: raises had
 Scarfield: taco monster
 Astrobytes: admittedly I'm more of a burrito guy but I'm not too fussy
 Wontonimo: just add rice and beans to your taco, and roll it completely closed
 Astrobytes: More or less yes :D
 Wontonimo: mmmm ... yeah, i could go for a burrito
 Astrobytes: Man, when I worked in London as a chef there was an amazing place for burritos on Kings Road in Chelsea, was 5-10 min walk from my work so used to go there around 4pm when I'd finished lunch service and all, then come back, eat it, then be almost comatose for the first hour of evening service :D
 Astrobytes: they were enormous
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: now im getting hungry :angry:
 Astrobytes: *hangry
 Scarfield: did you try and read the 100 year old i mentioned?
 Astrobytes: Not just yet, it's on the list though and not forgotten
 Scarfield: noice
 Astrobytes: Was telling my mother and my mate Erik about it not long after you mentioned it (separately I may add), Erik also recommended it
 Scarfield: i will reach out to the writer and ask for royalties
 Astrobytes: That will make you rich, I guarantee it
 Scarfield: i think my next books will be Arthur C. Clarke, or some other scince fiction, havent really read much in that genre
 Astrobytes: Just tell him your name is Erik Eriksson from Eriksborgensmultronland, Sverige and demand payment
 Scarfield: actually have a collection of Jules Verne i still need to read, but am open for suggestions&#160;:)
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Jules Verne definitely worth a read. Also War of the Worlds and HG Wells' other books.
 Astrobytes: Arthur C. Clarke for sure though
 Wontonimo: and hitch hikers guide to the galaxy
 Astrobytes: I loved ACCs Space Odyssey series, and the Rama books
 Astrobytes: I guess you already read some Asimov
 Scarfield: heard hitch hikers guide with stephen fry as narator, was great&#160;:)
 Scarfield: actually not any asimov either, i have so much scifi materil ahead of me 
 StraumliPerversion: Good to stick with the oldies.  All the new stuff is garbage.  Well, except for the murderbot books
 NewCoder09: :taco: Scarfield
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry NewCoder09 but you can only award tacos once per day
 Wontonimo: asimov is fantastic.  the foundation series is grea
 Astrobytes: I quite liked some of John Ringo's mil-sci stuff, he gets old really really quickly though
 Scarfield: went to the library the other day, and realised Asimov, ACC and generally scifi is something i almost havent read
 Astrobytes: as MrsGloryholeWesticlesPerversion says, stick to the old classics at least initially
 StraumliPerversion: Yeah, the John Ringo one where the aliens were addicted to maple syrup was pretty good
 Astrobytes: I preferred the posleen series myself, what was the maple syrup one?
 Astrobytes: Troy rising?
 StraumliPerversion: yes
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 Astrobytes: Ringo writes some good stuff but if you read a few it gets repetitive real quick, and I think he knows it
 Scarfield: nice, ty for the "tips"&#160;:) made an actual to read list now
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Astrobytes: If you read any Ringo, best not start with Die Wacht am Rhein
 Astrobytes: though it is very Iron Sky-ish
 StraumliPerversion: Sad to see good ones like Neal Stephenson go back.  His latest book is about global warming and Covid-21/23/29.  Great job guy
 StraumliPerversion: *go bad
 Astrobytes: Read it, maybe you'll like it :P
 Scarfield: have to "shoot" some noobs with a friend, ttyl&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: later Scarfield
 Astrobytes: I should probably fk off too, got a goddamn annoying fever. Might listen to Jeff Waynes Musical War of the Worlds since I'm feeling nostalgic

 NewCoder09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/BZuyHw9">https://tech.io/snippet/BZuyHw9</a>
 C26_1: I think to only boost if you have reach the previous pod and make sure the direction of your bot is follow the next pod
 struct: you can replace 100 by boost

 NewCoder09: oh ok thank you
 C26_1: everyone
 C26_1: I have a small problem
 C26_1: In python we have an array right
 NewCoder09: i think so
 NewCoder09: i use c++ so imnot real sure about it
 C26_1: What's the standard way to "Add an element"
 5922: in numpy
 C26_1: Like I have this code
 C26_1: array = [3,5,4]array.append(10)array[4] = 11print(array)
 C26_1: In the line 2 and 3
 5922: that is a list
 C26_1: .append() or assign?
 C26_1: @5922, ok I'm forgot that
 Krait_MkII: regarding best boost location, im calculating pod distances in 1st lap.then find max distance between pods. there i use boost.
 Krait_MkII: but make sure to use boost when next pod angle is 0, otherwise will boost in a wrong trajectory 
 Krait_MkII: is it a good idea&#160;? :thinking:
 struct: doesnt need to be 0
 DarkMatriac: I havent work on  pod racing in a while, But I think it is fine to boost even if the angle is not perfectly 0 
 Krait_MkII: thats correct too but i dnt kw a way to calculate the max angle
 Krait_MkII: hv u done shielding challenge&#160;? im there dnt much idea abt it 
 nulte: i would not worry to much about shield
 C26_1: @Krait_Mkll, Why does your text so weird
 C26_1: Does the keyboard have a problem?
 Krait_MkII: how weird&#160;? im using web chat 
 Krait_MkII: You now have access to SHIELD which lets you slam into your opponents with greater weight.
 Preza: hi guys
 Krait_MkII: this one 
 Krait_MkII: hey 
 C26_1: @Krait_Mkll, what?
 DarkMatriac: have there always been shields? I dont remember using those at all. Could be why I never manage to get out of gold league xD
 struct: shield is not needed until legend league
 DarkMatriac: Oh well just bad coding then xD
 Wontonimo: you can use shields as a break
 Krait_MkII: its kind of 3 or 4th test
 Wontonimo: because it reduces your speed down to zero
 Krait_MkII: nice idea mate :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: -3v
 antiwonto: [auto] '-3v' was defined as ' A PID controller reference for mad pod racing. Check out <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a> ' by Wontonimo
 Krait_MkII: ;hv to try that 
 struct: does the shield even help to slow down?
 Wontonimo: yeah, velocity goes to zero instantly
 struct: it does?
 struct: I dont think so
 Wontonimo: its been a while.  i thought it does.
 DarkMatriac: I even have memory leak in my code , what was I doing back then lol
 Krait_MkII: @antiwonto thx
 Wontonimo: oh, i may be wrong
 struct: that would mean your pod would instantly stop
 C26_1: speed = 0
 C26_1: But you can make your speed turns back through print()
 struct: all shield does is increase mass by 10
 struct: 10x
 Wontonimo: mass effect
 Krait_MkII: haha
 Krait_MkII: its better to use it when front of opponent 
 Wontonimo: idk
 C26_1: Waiy
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: How can I made a neural network tho
 Wontonimo: first get a small mammal or an undesired uncle 
 Wontonimo: C26_1 someone here named jacek made this great tutorial <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/b51fdf068b6dce96d27cc71eb133ffe113695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs">https://tech.io/playgrounds/b51fdf068b6dce96d27cc71eb133ffe113695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs</a>
 Krait_MkII: im using separate thread to track target's properties. i dnt kw if its best. im just starting to learn
 C26_1: wait everyone
 C26_1: I'm using the simplest logic by default in Mad Pod Racing
 C26_1: But somehow I have reached Rank#1 in Wood leauge
 C26_1: League
 C26_1: What
 C26_1: My bot needs to be better than the boss 3 to be able to reached the next rank
 Krait_MkII: may be its easy 
 Krait_MkII: its more like random luck sometimes. i played without changing code :D
 Rebollo: @struct
 Rebollo: I remember once you showed a data sctructure in c++ without pointers 
 struct: The node I use for MCTS?
 Rebollo: Ye I think so
 Rebollo: some different data type something strange to me
 Rebollo: what was that?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/acbfbe12-9633-4b3c-9ffc-c8f73d863f1d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/acbfbe12-9633-4b3c-9ffc-c8f73d863f1d</a>
 struct: this?
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: but not sure if it was exactly this one
 Rebollo: but anyway
 Rebollo: how dod you keep the references
 Rebollo: and move from node to node?
 struct: I have an array inside the tree
 struct: MCTSNode**   parents;
 struct: Every time I select a node I added there
 struct: I add it there*
 Rebollo: hum
 Rebollo: the tree itself is an array?
 struct: I allocate all the memory at the start 
 struct: so yes
 struct: The tree has an arary in it
 struct: with all the nodes Ill need
 struct: I allocate 30M+ nodes on first turn
 Rebollo: would you share a piece of this code?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a49ca49f-b7e1-4fc5-89a2-0f4d96d37ee1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a49ca49f-b7e1-4fc5-89a2-0f4d96d37ee1</a>
 struct: which part?
 Rebollo: you have N childs?
 struct: number of children for each node is stored inside the node
 struct: child_count
 Rebollo: wow very nice
 Rebollo: would share the expannd and backpropagate?
 xxd: first_child and child_count together designate a contiguous segment of the big array as the node's children
 xxd: bruh are you just tryna steal his algorithm now
 Rebollo: my goal is to learn
 Rebollo: I am not stealing anything

 Rebollo: I would never copy anything
 Rebollo: I will try to understand and if so try to implment by my self
 xxd: why do you have float visits as a parameter?
 xxd: is visits&#160;!= 1?
 struct: yes because I rollout all the nodes expanded
 xxd: or is this for more complicated stuff (and speaking of that, what's the optimization where you can begin to backpropagate results where you're sure of a win)
 xxd: ah i see
 xxd: s/a win/a win or a loss/

 xxd: i just want the name by which to refer to it so i can do some research on it
 struct: MCTS
 antiwonto: [auto] 'MCTS' was defined as ' Monte Carlo Tree Search ' by Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: it's called MCTS solver <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235985858_A_Survey_of_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_Methods">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235985858_A_Survey_of_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_Methods</a>
 xxd: ah solver, i recall now. thanks!
 Wontonimo: :avacado:
 Wontonimo:&#160;;(
 xxd: :avocado:
 xxd: :P
 struct: rollout_score = temp.eval() should be rollout
 struct: But Im not doing any rollout on that mcts I shared
 struct: do you understand Rebollo?
 Rebollo: not yet
 Rebollo: But I will get there
 Rebollo: I need some time to digest..
 Rebollo: but really compact code congrats
 struct: current_node is selected in the select function
 struct: which uses UCB
 struct: I coded my first mcts without even reading the papers
 struct: But i coded it wrong at the time
 struct: but it still did well enough
 struct: was like 100 rank on uttt at the time
 Rebollo: I wish I had this talent
 Rebollo: but I am just a struggler
 xxd: 'tis okay
 Wontonimo: here is some reference code Rebollo
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg">https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg</a>
 Rebollo: let me see
 Rebollo: why do you choose this strategy instead of common data structures?
 Rebollo: many benefits?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/panchishin/gMCTS">https://github.com/panchishin/gMCTS</a>
 xxd: it is good for saving space
 xxd: less indirection
 Wontonimo: Rebollo , if you use classic object oriented programming then you code will be nice, readable, modular, reusable
 Wontonimo: what it won't be is performant 
 Wontonimo: check out this video Rebollo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=data+orientated+programming">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=data+orientated+programming</a>
 Wontonimo: about how to program specifically to the task to get the most performance possible
 Rebollo: cool I got it
 struct: all you need is cppcon videos
 Rebollo: whats the goal of the game example you sent?
 struct: the tech io is four in a row
 struct: connect 4
 struct: or w/e its called
 Wontonimo: hey, i just realized i have 2 of the 4 machine learning puzzles :grin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/machine-learning">https://www.codingame.com/learn/machine-learning</a>
 Rebollo: did not get the goal of this game
 Rebollo: rs
 Rebollo: lol
 struct: The easiest game to test is mcts
 struct: you can run all the possible states
 Rebollo: how the AI whin with this?
 struct: and check if it matches all the possible ones

 struct: it knows N moves ahead
 struct: that it will win
 Rebollo: hum
 xxd: how large is your node pool array
 struct: depends on the game
 xxd: how would i go about figuring out how big i should make it
 struct: Usually its 30M plus
 xxd: branch factor ^ depth?
 xxd: ok
 struct: 768MB is the ram you have
 xxd: uint8_t status inside MCTSNode is for MCTS Solver right?
 struct: yes
 struct: I use values to check 
 struct: 0 unsolved, 1 loss, 2 draw, 3 win
 xxd: :thumbsup:
 nulte: promotion keep bugging...
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 nulte: Its only a bit annoying
 nulte: Im not even sure if its worth to report it
 nulte: Not sure if it was reported already
 nulte: now i get 0.01 away from boss ofc 
 nulte: I guess its worth to report it now
 nulte: :p
 Wontonimo: which multi?
 nulte: amazonial Im gonna keep resubmiting
 nulte: I guess
 Wontonimo: is the boss at 25.64
 nulte: yes
 nulte: 2562 now
 Wontonimo: are you using your usual mcts&#160;?
 nulte: nah
 nulte: this is my old code
 nulte: I just wanted to get all the rules
 nulte: this is just 1 depth search
 nulte: ok it worked now
 nulte: Now I must bitboard this&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: but what about your gold bot?
 nulte: The bot is the same
 nulte: I just prefer to code on this account

 antiwonto: [auto] hey Timegoeswell, dont paste those links here.  Use the channel #clash
 Timegoeswell: sorry 
 Timegoeswell: :confounded:
 Wontonimo: nice to see the clash channel get some traffic
 Ninjatron: I am the traffic man
 Ninjatron: call me Mistaa Toraffiku from now on
 Wontonimo: hey trafficman, where is your red stop sign thing?
 Ninjatron: good point
 Wontonimo: do you have water?
 Ninjatron: ok here it is
 Wontonimo: you have water, then you are a waterboy
 Ninjatron: no water stop is right here
 Ninjatron: somehow I feel more authoritative
 Wontonimo: nice new stop sigh
 Ninjatron: it is like I am commanding people without commanding them
 Ninjatron: the guy in the photo must be you old man
 Wontonimo: nothing compared to the power of my 1000 yard stare which makes people hallucinate lightenbolts 
 Wontonimo: i bet you see on while you stare at my eyes
 Ninjatron: what lightenbolt?
 Wontonimo: unreasonable  denial is the secondary effect
 Ninjatron: denial of what?
 Wontonimo: complete befuddlement and repeating yourself is the final effect of the stare before total mental collapse
 Ninjatron: you talking to me?
 Wontonimo: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: anyway ... 
 Wontonimo: that went nowhere funny.
 Ninjatron: i said you talking to me?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Ninjatron: why?
 Ninjatron: i wasn't talking no one...
 Wontonimo: that's a good question
 Wontonimo: why was i talkingto you
 Ninjatron: i don't know you said something about lights in your head
 Ninjatron: maybe having seizures old man?
 Ninjatron: oooohhh
 Ninjatron: now I see
 Ninjatron: you are a prophet
 StraumliPerversion: please limit all conversations to MPR
 Ninjatron: what is MPR?
 StraumliPerversion: thank you for complying
 Ninjatron: what is MPR? Map pod racing?
 MrZee: Mom's perfect rice
 MrZee: Or possibly, manual propeller rotation

 eulerscheZahl: thanks. thibaud will review and discard this
 eulerscheZahl: btw there is an extra popup when you click the report button. i didn't know either, was my first report
 Westicles: did he win the clash?
 j4at: Huh, I don't think you saw the image euler
 j4at: Nah, he is bad. He is probably the last or something
 eulerscheZahl: oh saw the profile picture."thibaud will discard" was related to you reporting me (or pretending to)
 eulerscheZahl: monday morning, time to start my regular job
 theFunny: Yessir
 jacek: dang. have you ever found a bug so massive you wonder how it did somehow worked up until now?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey jacek, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 46 tacos
 j4at: and then when you fix the bug. you find out that the buggy solution is better
 Lassassin: how to add a friend? All i get is follow
 jacek: you just both follow each other
 emh: good morning
 aCat: helo&#160;:-)
 jbiz: anyone else experienced an exception on the code clash thing? The exception was thrown on the 4th test example during parsing of the input - by the automatically generated code, not the code I wrote
 jbiz: as I'm the only one programming in c#, I assume the bug is unique to that particular test and language?
 jbiz: I even programmed a work around so that I passed all 4 test inputs (all green 100%), but then it only registered 75% after submitting
 jbiz: so, in short, clash of code - sometimes buggy?
 Lassassin: i code in js my whole life is bug
 jbiz: lol
 emh: A Bug's Life
 WhaIe: @jbiz You can share your code here and describe the problem statement
 derjack: jbiz it could be bug in the clash. sometimes people use reserved words in genetor stub
 derjack: and they dont test for all the languages
 Nerchio: bugfixes not merged yet right?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Nerchio, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 emh: Nerchio tooltips changed (just now?). maybe that means new version is published. they now say which app was released and how many permanent daily+arch
 emh: or wait
 emh: maybe those are the app resources
 emh: yeahh probably
 Nerchio: nice that might be it
 Nerchio: time to start using training and coding hehe
 emh: ohh training and coding was fixed long ago I think
 MSmits: no, there is a training bug
 emh: another one?
 MSmits: yes
 emh: gz MSmits on working sim btw
 MSmits: is fixed, but not sure if it is live
 MSmits: thank emh, will be fitting params and experimenting with eval the rest of the week
 Nerchio: i will be sticking to sim + heuristics
 Nerchio: to avoid fitting params all week :D
 MSmits: might be better yeah
 MSmits: but i suck at heuristics
 MSmits: btw emh, the bug with training is that you sometimes don't get the play you should get.
 emh: ahh ok
 MSmits: has to do with how they track playsLeft. It sometimes gets to -1 and then on start of the phase, the +1 does not lead to extra plays
 emh: heh
 MSmits: its a coding bug too i guess
 MSmits: but they fixed it anyways, just not sure if it's live yet
 Nerchio: oh btw I had a question, do you get 50ms per turn or per phase, or rather what is considered a turn in this game
 MSmits: phase
 Nerchio: ok that's nice
 MSmits: otherwise you'd crash on input if you used all your time
 Nerchio: so i can sim again for skill casting
 MSmits: yeah
 kovi: forum says all fixes were deployed 45mins ago
 MSmits: cool
 Nerchio: :money_mouth:
 MSmits: anyway gotta go do some teaching, back to coding tonight&#160;:)
 Nerchio: same, work work work
 therealbeef: work is such a distraction from hobbies&#160;:(
 Nerchio: true, unless you like your work as well then its not too bad
 jacek: then work for CG [solved]

 5DN1L: What did you output? Can you copy and paste the whole thing shown in the console? jwpapi

 jwpapi: my full solution
 5DN1L: oh
 5DN1L: that response is a string
 5DN1L: you should remove the quotes
 jacek:     jumpDown() {
 jwpapi: ahh no that doesn’t change it
 jwpapi: ohhh
 5DN1L: but this is wrong, right? console.log('response');
 jwpapi: I see
 jwpapi: yes the 'response' wasn’t in there before
 jwpapi: but the empty console.log() was the problem I had the whole time before
 5DN1L: almost the extra console.log as pointed out by jacek above
 5DN1L: also*
 jwpapi: yh now just one more error left  but that’s in my logic
 jwpapi: or at least 1 error&#160;:)

 5DN1L: i know i can ban you too
 j4at: KEKW
 skitles: wha-
 5DN1L: skities never mind that for now
 5DN1L: what do you mean by "maybe"?
 5DN1L: you either have learned it before or not
 5DN1L: if not, this website is probably too difficult for you
 skitles: waitttttttttt no i havent
 skitles: is there a easy on
 skitles: i meant is there a easy on also im a student
 skitles: at my school
 5DN1L: skities this is not a tutorial website. unless you don't mind researching while learning, you'd better learn a programming language on another website first
 5DN1L: this website is mostly for practising what you've learned
 skitles: wait how are you a bot anyway
 5DN1L: sigh
 skitles: hmmmmmmmmmm
 skitles: hey buddy
 5DN1L: have you got better things to say than keep saying that i'm a bot? are you able to read even one word of what i've typed?
 skitles: no like are you a real bot

 Automaton2000: one of the tests provided in the ide
 skitles: no he has a creator
 skitles: btw who made you
 skitles: 5DN1L

 Noyotens: how?
 struct: You get all cards that are in players
 struct: so you subtract 5-that

 Noyotens: what if the cards got used to release an app?

 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have 6 bonus and a cont_int ... one of the apps the ref is telling me i can play needs 4 and 4, and they are not cont_int.  So bonus takes care of 6...but not the last 2 ... ref seems to be wrong.&#160;:(

 struct: you sum them all together
 struct: and the do
 struct: 5 - ammount for the first 8

 geppoz: the two positions...
 Noyotens: oh thx4
 geppoz: depends on language, you can also replace %8 with &amp;7
 geppoz: but I think most compilers will do by themselves
 jacek: html compiler too?
 geppoz: question: I have 1 skill, 1 bonus, 2 debts
 geppoz: it allows me to release a 4+4 taking 5 debts
 geppoz: how it is possible? I don't have 8 skills in total, but just 6
 geppoz: uh

 aangairbender: hi guys, do I receive a card just after MOVE phase or after THROW/GIVE phases?
 struct: after give
 aangairbender: ok, thank you, more difficult to simulate:sweat:

 struct: Yeah
 j4at: read the referee
 aangairbender: the way referee simulates turn scares me:confounded:
 jacek: thats just java
 Astrobytes: :D
 j4at: yeah we all should agree to use c# instead of java
 aangairbender: its not only about language, it's about putting different levels of abstraction in the same place imo
 Arthur_Morgan_RDR2: Why though?
 aangairbender: also imperative code creates cognitive load, it's hard to find what you are looking for

 Noyotens: I got this one time, u need to wait about a day
 mliboz: How can we find out the time, cuz I've been clicking on it every 5/10 min to check&#160;:(

 Noyotens: thats how i got to silver
 ToshiTuringMachine: predict next turn when draw deck is small
 Noyotens: but i guess is time to change
 ToshiTuringMachine: is someone of you guys able to track and predict enemy hand?
 StevenV: my code to silver is less than 20 statements (exclude the input/output)
 drogenbarbarian: can anyone tell me how the descent works
 jacek: drogenbarbarian you have hints on the left
 Astrobytes: From up, you go down. That's called descent.
 drogenbarbarian: thank you
 anonymer.jamal: np
 BrunoFelthes: print the first statement can get silver?
 anonymer.jamal: no
 Astrobytes: apparently so Bruno
 j4at: BrunoFelthes thats what i did&#160;:)
 BrunoFelthes: OMG
 anonymer.jamal: ez
 Bullzeyes: What do you guys mean with that&#160;? Can you literally output "first" to get promoted&#160;?
 StevenV: =)
 KNTK: Wait what does new league appearing mean? Is there some threshold for amount of players
 StevenV: which league are you in?
 Bullzeyes: I am now in Silver
 Astrobytes: Yes. And to get legend you just output "pwn"
 anonymer.jamal: im a legend
 BrunoFelthes: maybe because the random cards, you can be promoted
 StevenV: and you don't understand what it mean&#160;???
 StevenV: you are a mystery!!!
 Astrobytes: StevenV :D
 drogenbarbarian: i am diamond 2
 StevenV: :D
 Bullzeyes: Yeah no idea what "print the first statement" means
 anonymer.jamal: iim radiant in valorant
 jacek: print first action from possible_moves
 Astrobytes: the first available legal action given in the input
 jacek: i know! how about PR to shuffle the possible moves :imp:
 Bullzeyes: Aaah ok&#160;! Thanks :D
 Astrobytes: Well, you can still sort them according to some heuristics
 BrunoFelthes: no jacek, it will broke my AI
 j4at: Bullzeyes yeah, if you follow this tutorial you can get to silver by only printing "first" <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 jacek: youd have to have some heuristics first
 Astrobytes: that url looks familiar
 jacek: my favorite
 Astrobytes: indeed
 struct: antiwonto should warn about it ...
 Bullzeyes: Maybe it was some bug idk. First time on this side, F me for asking right&#160;?
 jacek: oO
 struct: There is even a better action than first
 Miki09: lol just turned on the pc and random got promoted to silver
 struct: - 3 * a value
 anonymer.jamal: 2^3 =&#160;?
 Nerchio: 1
 Astrobytes: how did you guess my move sorting heuristic struct :o :P
 struct: Well it was not easy
 struct: First I had to reverse engineer random
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: man, really gonna miss this chat
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 struct: chat has been fine lately
 struct: its summer break I guess
 Astrobytes: Yeah, indeed
 struct: Time to hide the rank and start coding again, ping me if needed.
 Astrobytes: will do
 StevenV: ping him and don't let him code
 Astrobytes: lol
 StevenV: :D
 drogenbarbarian: hi
 BrunoFelthes: is societe generale contracting?
 Zylo: emh: draw&#160;:-D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/643316867">https://www.codingame.com/replay/643316867</a>
 wlesavo: 66 6 6 =)
 Miki09: Can continuous integration automate itself?
 struct: Not the same card
 Miki09: hmmm
 struct: but if you have 2 integration then you can
 Miki09: ok thanks
 Miki09: One more question - can I just automate 8 bonus cards?
 struct: yes
 BrunoFelthes: only 25 battles to compute the silver rank?
 Miki09: So I can finish application with 8 bonus?
 darkhorse64: triple wind in approach
 struct: I guess they lowered it to save the servers a bit
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: yes miki
 Miki09: Thanks
 BrunoFelthes: will this contest have the 20 t-shirts?
 struct: Don't think so
 StevenV: we have 3 phones right?
 struct: yes
 struct: well only 2 because we already know who is getting 1st
 Astrobytes: :D
 j4at: yeah printing the first possible action is so op. Im 1st for sure.
 kovi: big silver and only 2x30 games?
 _Royale: kovi: green IT&#160;:-D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Sheeesh---: what do you mean by printing the first possible action&#160;?
 Astrobytes: the first legal move given in the input
 Astrobytes: *legal action
 Sheeesh---: is that a thing lol?
 Astrobytes: It would seem so
 eulerscheZahl: hey, i'm in silver
 MSmits: hey
 Astrobytes: not sure there was ever any doubt over that outcome :D
 eulerscheZahl: kovi 05:01ᴾᴹbig silver and only 2x30 games?
 eulerscheZahl: more a "hey i'm done with work and silver is open"
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I think you have a ticket to gold as well euler&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so do you
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and Sebastien has tickets in the forum
 MSmits: haha
 Astrobytes: more bugs?
 eulerscheZahl: didn't check, just wanted to make a pun with ticket
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: pun achieved
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Astrobytes: bugfixes were released earlier today
 eulerscheZahl: scores somewhat close, no bot dominating and crushing all others. and i think that won't change anymore
 MSmits: hah, watch me wreck them
 MSmits: possibly...
 MSmits: in some days...
 Sheeesh---:  lol
 Astrobytes: wait for Dapo :D
 MSmits: it will depend on how badly dapo needs a phone
 Astrobytes: hehe yes indeed
 struct: did he need 2 ps 5?
 MSmits: did he win 2?
 Astrobytes: who doesn't?!
 struct: I think so
 jacek: he needed ps10?
 emh: too few battles. good submit rank 12 and bad submit rank 21. for 2 submits. who knows what you can do with more
 struct: I hope they dont forget to increas the number of battles
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: from experience: will be more battles again, just for league opening
 Astrobytes: yeah it was the same last contest iirc
 jacek: in last contest they needed it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/contest-green-circle/196455/78">https://forum.codingame.com/t/contest-green-circle/196455/78</a>jacek also found the missing legal action
 eulerscheZahl: bonus feature
 jacek: well someone else did, i just reported
 jacek: i rely on provided actions
 struct: I dont think its worth to fix it
 jacek: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: should have kept it to myself&#160;:(
 struct: Well there was even a bigger bug that was reported yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: the MOVE stay
 struct: yes
 MSmits: whats that?
 Astrobytes: that was an amusing one
 eulerscheZahl: fixed, doesn't matter
 struct: you could avoid to pay taxes
 MSmits: does this mean you can also avoid death?
 eulerscheZahl: no, death comes to you if you don't move
 MSmits: o
 eulerscheZahl: what a service
 Astrobytes: was gonna say something about investment banking and tax but I think I'll keep that one to myself... :D
 Astrobytes: my chat killing skills are still on point :muscle:
 MSmits: hehe sry, trying to focus on coding. Too many ideas left, too little time
 Astrobytes: lol all good, i need to go make some bread anyway, afk for a bit
 eulerscheZahl: coding too
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 square1001: Wow, I just self-played the game (of score-5-and-end version) and the first player won 744 / 1000 times! This game may be favorable for the first player.
 struct: yeah it probably is
 Sheeesh---: yes
 Sheeesh---: but the arena
 Sheeesh---: you always play both phases against any bot
 Sheeesh---: in the arena*
 struct: Maybe if the 1st move of p2 didnt take into account give
 struct: it would be more balanced
 struct: but I might be wrong
 Sheeesh---: so it's fair
 struct: no Sheeesh--- , it doesnt really work like that
 Sheeesh---: why&#160;?
 Sheeesh---: you play first turn
 Sheeesh---: then the enemy plays first
 struct: Yes I know but the 1st player has a big advantage
 struct: even a way worse bot might win
 struct: So it is a problem
 struct: I don't know how to explain it
 Sheeesh---: but that's a problem for everyone soo i think it's not a problem
 Sheeesh---: you will always get your chance to play first
 Sheeesh---: it's not random as far as i know
 jacek: given bugs found my people, maybe this is community contest :thinking:
 therealbeef: seems we're getting 200 battles in silver now
 jacek: :tada:
 OldJohn: Hello, can someone explain me why orange has more than 4 cards in his hand at move 74 and more&#160;?
 OldJohn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/643386070">https://www.codingame.com/replay/643386070</a>
 Illedan: Hmm, the THROW card phase will always be 2 cards in a row, else it is known. So it could have been 1 action with 2 card outputs :thinking:
 struct: he has 4 architecture
 struct: so he draws 4 more cards OldJohn
 KNTK: In green circle, can I see how many cards are left in each location?
 struct: yes
 Zylo: he played: ARCHITECTURE_STUDY many times
 OldJohn: OK, that was a point in the rule I did not understood thanks&#160;!
 struct: KNTK you need to sum all cards given in inputs then subtract
 struct: 5 - sum
 struct: for all cards between 0-7
 KNTK: oh yeah cause it is always 5 at the beginning, thanks
 struct: bonus cards 36-bonus
 struct: and ofr tech its 100
 eulerscheZahl: coding your own sim really helps to understand the rules
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i'm a bit late to the chat
 jacek: just like when coding chess engine i finally understood when en passant occurs
 kovi: i still rely on possible moves for that&#160;:)
 jacek: :unamused:
 eulerscheZahl: "capturing en passent is only legal immediately after the opposing pawn moves 2 squares forward"
 struct: thats correct
 eulerscheZahl: had a chess program in my childhood and triggered that sentence many times, burnt into my memory
 eulerscheZahl: back then i wasn't able to translate it
 struct: en passant was just created to save time
 jacek: to nerf 2 squares moves
 eulerscheZahl: "your king is still in check by the bishop in E4"
 jacek: pawns couldnt move 2 squares in ~1500
 eulerscheZahl: really?
 eulerscheZahl: i never know when you are trolling
 struct: so they had push pawns twice
 struct: in the opening
 jacek: so en passant was a way to nerf them. i think
 StevenV: en passant?
 struct: Its serious
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant#History">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant#History</a>
 eulerscheZahl: now you even edit wikipedia? that's some dedicated trolling
 StevenV: :D
 eulerscheZahl: param tuner is running. nothing ground-breaking yet&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to tweak params manually and analyze replays in that confusing viewer
 jacek: you go msmits route?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know his route
 struct: last time I used param tuner it costed me 20€
 eulerscheZahl: good
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Was the params worth it?
 struct: no
 struct: But I was trying to fit like 40 params
 struct: Might be one of the reasons
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: ceg kept his laptop running for 3 days straight
 struct: Too hot for that
 eulerscheZahl: then he realized that he has to make his program actually read the params that are given
 jacek: they should have made contests in winter
 struct: lol
 Illedan: lol
 kovi: hard to paramtune solo with varying meta
 eulerscheZahl: i currently have 10 versions of my arena bot fighting each other
 struct: I was trying to tune params for SC21 at the time I think
 kovi: (unless building multiple bots or batchrun vs. representative instances)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b08b6c1d-ffe5-4e50-8832-7474268f5df7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b08b6c1d-ffe5-4e50-8832-7474268f5df7</a>
 jacek: does it beat random? does it beat first-action bot
 jacek: invalid paste
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec77aa25-94a4-4e92-b25b-0caa3a58f293">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec77aa25-94a4-4e92-b25b-0caa3a58f293</a>
 jacek: nyoro~n
 StevenV: so this is a simulat... one
 jacek: would they bother fixing it if chat is gonna die anyway
 eulerscheZahl: without the chat i would have missed some engine bugs and probably analyzed my own code more. you also help me to understand the rules&#160;:(
 jacek: theres still discord...
 eulerscheZahl: when i left, it was full of phishing
 eulerscheZahl: apart from that i was the only one writing to #external-contests
 struct: Time to take a short break, I think I finally have a working sim
 eulerscheZahl: and that's all you ever wanted
 eulerscheZahl: it's not about using it, it's about having it
 struct: exactly
 struct: im just running MC
 eulerscheZahl: did you submit your sim?
 struct: yes its not good
 struct: i do like 100 iterations of MC
 struct: I just want to check if its crashing or not
 BrunoFelthes: is that possible that i use code or training and do not draft any card?
 struct: yes
 struct: if discard and deck are empty
 BrunoFelthes: if i have any cards at draw or discard, i will buy a card
 BrunoFelthes: for sure?
 eulerscheZahl: much better way of solving it than infinite loop
 struct: yes bruno
 eulerscheZahl: buy? as in: get a completely new one?
 struct: training doesnt buy, it draws
 BrunoFelthes: ok, draw
 struct: so if the draw pile is empty
 struct: then draw pile = discard pile
 struct: if its  still empty then you wont draw any
 eulerscheZahl: statement is inconsistent enough in terminology, we don't need additional confusion
 Scarfield: do you get to choose which cards that are used to release in bronze?
 struct: doesnt matter Scarfield
 Illedan: You get the optimal way anyway
 eulerscheZahl: tmpZMwFPu might even be a small improvement, looking good so far
 struct: ok only that matters yeah
 Illedan: What is that string euler? 
 BrunoFelthes: but if I have no cards to draw, and use training, i can use two more skills?
 struct: The hole hand will get discarded anyways Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: Path.GetFileName(Path.GetTempFileName())
 Illedan: Training gives 1 more action
 Illedan: Coding gives 2 more
 Illedan: bruno
 BrunoFelthes: so coding
 Illedan: Yes
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: training gives 2 more cards
 Scarfield: oh cards spent on release are put in discard pile? lol
 eulerscheZahl: everything you touched with your chocolate fingers goes into discard
 struct: yes Scarfield
 struct: but automated cards remain automated
 Scarfield: yea i see, assumed they where discarded from the entire game. have not spent so much time on this yet
 eulerscheZahl: then you would always be low on cards
 eulerscheZahl: and have an extra game turn to decide if you want to use your bonus or skill cards for the application
 Scarfield: each phase is considered a turn of 50ms i suppose?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: a phase can last multiple turns of 50ms
 eulerscheZahl: when you have to throw 2 cards for instance
 eulerscheZahl: i successfully confused Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: Skatfield
 Scarfield: thats not an achiement xD
 Scarfield: but makes sense with the input, still in wood 1, so cant throw 2 cards yet
 Scarfield: skat is treasure in DK :heart_eyes:
 Scarfield: or honey
 eulerscheZahl: my good candidate from the local arena just got butchered. rock-paper-scissors this early already&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: Skat is a card game i never understood
 Scarfield: its also tax, a silly word with too many meanings&#160;:)
 yhyoxx: i wanna buy samsara just for the manual
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 benobab: ahaha
 jacek: DK likes taxes eh
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: we pay a lot of it at least, but generally people are fine with it, we get a lot for free from it, education, health care so on
 struct: ok ill move to dk
 Astrobytes: can I claim asylum there? :D
 struct: I dont think portugal will have free health care in a few years
 Astrobytes: same in the uk
 Scarfield: i dont know how hard it is to get a citizenship honestly, you have to pass this weird history test (i tried it and failed) to prove you would fit in 
 struct: I need citizenship?
 Astrobytes: Can't I just do an impression of a Danish accent or something&#160;? :D
 Scarfield: for the health care i think so, for the education no
 struct: Cant I just buy it?
 struct: I know that portugal sells it
 Astrobytes: Can I dwell in the woods freely?
 borrel: good question
 Scarfield: there are private hospitals, but if you get injured while here, you would get taken care of, if you go here with an injury i dont think you would get care, unless its to safe your life, honestly i dont know 
 Scarfield: in sweden you can, but not in DK
 Scarfield: ah you can dwell, but your tent cannot be seen from house, road, path etc
 Astrobytes: well in Scotland you can wild camp you see, in England you can't 
 Astrobytes: that's a fair rule, can live with that
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: looking forward to visit you in the woods
 Scarfield: metal dweller hermit
 Astrobytes: here you can go anywhere, but it's polite to ask the landowners permission
 Astrobytes: (if there is one)
 Astrobytes: lol, right on! :D
 Scarfield: its the same in sweden, you can pretty much go anywhere, stay anywhere (for a day) if you leave it as it was, and walk on private land, DK is more limited, but we dont have that much forest anywho
 emh: quick someone bump me down so I get a bad ranking and can resubmit to test my new stuff haha. I don't want to resubmit as long as I'm near the top
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: Nice rank though
 emh: thanks
 Illedan: Simming?
 eulerscheZahl: an emh doesn't simulate. he fights if-else with even more if-else
 emh: true
 Illedan: Simming the IFs? :O
 MSmits: java is weird, what is an atomic integer?
 eulerscheZahl: an int
 Scarfield: a very small one
 eulerscheZahl: int vs Integer
 eulerscheZahl: Integer is an object
 kovi: i am really surprised that heuritics survived after training fix
 MSmits: ok which is most like a C# int?
 jacek: AtomicInteger is synchronized integer
 kovi: it seems that ci-bonus is way too powerful
 Illedan: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: c# int is both int and Integer
 emh: I'm heavily CI-based
 eulerscheZahl: java: List&lt;int&gt;? no no!
 eulerscheZahl: List&lt;Integer&gt; B)
 MSmits: you are making me more confused&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: in C# everything inherits from object
 eulerscheZahl: so you have ToString(), Hashcode(), ...
 jacek: MSmits did you ask about AtomicInteger?
 eulerscheZahl: in Java the atomics (int, bool, float, double) don't
 MSmits: yea jacek
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: eulerscheZahl theyre called morel ike primitives
 MSmits: so i cant do int.toString in java?
 MSmits: unless i do Integer?
 eulerscheZahl: listen to jacek, he has to deal with this in his regular job
 eulerscheZahl: String.valueOf(myInt)
 MSmits: oh yeah i used that
 eulerscheZahl: or myInt + "" for implicit
 jacek: int+""
 eulerscheZahl: java also lacks operator overloading
 eulerscheZahl: or extension functions
 jacek: thats what we have kotlin for
 eulerscheZahl: used it a few times for Kotlin Heroes
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't that bad actually
 eulerscheZahl: i would still need some more time to really get used to it
 jacek: just copy pasted java code into intellij to konvert
 MSmits: whats a final in java?
 MSmits: and why is it final?
 eulerscheZahl: doing it the kotlin way and not just forcing my java knowledge into it
 jacek: readonly
 jacek: or const?
 eulerscheZahl: something like that
 eulerscheZahl: not a compile-time constant
 MSmits: mmh i see
 eulerscheZahl: in c# you can do fun LINQ stuff
 eulerscheZahl: in java you have to make sure the argument is final first
 Illedan: :tada:
 emh: ok I must test. goodbye rank
 Illedan: My search managed to do something
 Illedan: My deck was 10 cards, all Technical Debt :D
 eulerscheZahl: for (int i = 0; i&lt; 10; i++) {final int f = i;myList.stream().filter(item -&gt; item == i).whatever()
 eulerscheZahl: == fnot i
 eulerscheZahl: i is a compiler error
 MSmits: grats Illedan&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: not make the debt score minus points
 jacek: actually in java since lambda introduction they dont have to be final
 jacek: just effectively final
 eulerscheZahl: java 8 lambdas or did i miss something?
 jacek: eeyup
 eulerscheZahl: Egypt?
 StevenV: egz
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/86ApDcJ.png">https://i.imgur.com/86ApDcJ.png</a>apparently my parcel is in Delhi and Nuremberg and will therefore arrive today on the 30th. i'm confused
 Nerchio: what did you order
 eulerscheZahl: won a topcoder tshirt. last year
 Nerchio: why is it in India
 Astrobytes: that's one impressive parcel
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder is located in india and US
 struct: I didnt have that problem
 eulerscheZahl: i think German customs blocked it, should have arrived around new year
 eulerscheZahl: seems like i get another chance of receiving it
 Astrobytes: The parcel seems to have other ideas :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'll closely track it and call customs if needed
 Astrobytes: wise move
 eulerscheZahl: i think topcoder even prints your username on the tshirts
 Astrobytes: nice!
 Astrobytes: hopefully they don't spell it as they say it... yooler-shezzle
 eulerscheZahl: yooler shezzal
 Astrobytes: You should print your own one with that on it for November
 eulerscheZahl: fun part: i had no idea what you were talking about. googled for it and google suggested: did you mean eulersche Zahl. i was impressed
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you would be the only one to get the joke if i did that
 Astrobytes: you don't remember the woman in the TC video?
 eulerscheZahl: jessie
 eulerscheZahl: sure i do
 eulerscheZahl: she organizes TCO
 Astrobytes: she would get it
 Astrobytes: the joke I mean
 Michael_Howard: What is the "release tooltip" that _SG_Sebastien says contains the released application details? I can't find it. :eyeglasses:
 emh: hover over the blue and orange stripes below the replay
 Astrobytes: ^
 Michael_Howard: Ah! Thanks.
 eulerscheZahl: interesting. i'm timing out in a busy turn
 BrunoFelthes: is all possible actions with all move/plays/draws/throws/gives for an entire player turn too big?
 Razovsky: nice top10 MSmits
 BrunoFelthes: i mean, build the tree, with the random variation. Is it too big?
 Razovsky: try it and tell us
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl time for C++?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i should remove duplicate states from my move gen
 BrunoFelthes: do you generate all possible states during the move phase eulerscheZahl?
 struct: hard to say bruno
 eulerscheZahl: at least the ones i can see coming
 eulerscheZahl: i don't draw hidden cards and branch on the possibilities
 BrunoFelthes: what you mean?
 struct: you dont draw hidden?
 struct: o.o
 BrunoFelthes: what is hidden cards?
 eulerscheZahl: i draw them but don't try to reveal
 struct: cards in draw pile and discard pile
 struct: ah I see
 eulerscheZahl: except if i take the whole stack
 BrunoFelthes: me too
 eulerscheZahl: this submit is total garbage. 2h of param tuning went into it
 BrunoFelthes: i want to try to refactor all my code to try to build an emulator to build all possible moves... but i dont know if the memory will explode
 struct: less tuning and more features to the eval
 BrunoFelthes: if the branch factor is too high
 eulerscheZahl: it's not that much
 BrunoFelthes: maybe i should try
 MSmits: thanks Razovsky
 struct: also throw is easily pruned
 eulerscheZahl: oh no. i must have introduced a bug while making the magic constants editable
 eulerscheZahl: even with my old magic in new format i fail
 Illedan: Mine manages to release applications now :D
 Nickkkkkk: Hi&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i definitely broke my bot, changed the behavior
 eulerscheZahl: may future me deal with this
 Nerchio: top20 is getting tough :scream:
 Nerchio: stop coding guys
 BrunoFelthes: hauhauha
 BrunoFelthes: legend is going far away
 StevenV: heyza, i don't know how to push
 Scarfield: looks like your submit worked emh :muscle:
 emh: Scarfield yes
 emh: now again
 emh: hehe
 emh: I have 138 submits so far
 Nerchio: and again and again
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: how many captchas?
 emh: none
 struct: I heard the winner is going to be the person who gets legend with the fewest submits
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: haha
 emh: hehe
 Scarfield: rise alts
 Nerchio: so probably people that pick first available action
 Hadd2: gm
 struct: gm
 PiterYeh: my c++ program is just crashing but i don't know why&#160;:'(
 PiterYeh: is there any way to know why my bot crashes without using a debugger locally?
 struct: not really, the c++ error messages are broken on ide I think
 PiterYeh: that's just evil
 jk_java: hi guys, looking for feedback on a CoC contribution
 jk_java: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/20739e7af87e7682761095576937ba9196bba">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/20739e7af87e7682761095576937ba9196bba</a>
 Smekarn: Totally worth to give a card to the opponent just for the extra 50ms I get!
 struct: do you think so?
 Scarfield: if there are no apps left where one of your skill cards are needed, i suppose it "could" be worth it
 struct: depends on the card
 struct: I would not want to give training or coding
 struct: even if they are not needed
 struct: But I might be wrong
 Smekarn: No, I was just kidding. But would be nice if the sim could find such edge-case&#160;:)
 Scarfield: even if kidding, there could be situations where its worth it i guess, but rarely
 Scarfield: clouding their draw chance to win, increasing your own draw chance to win that kinda thing
 Smekarn: Yes that I agree!
 putibuzu: top bots are all sims by now I guess?
 struct: I know em h is not sim
 struct: dont know about the rest
 Michael_Howard: Top how many? I'm 60 no sim (or TASK_PRIORITIZATION yet for that matter).
 Michael_Howard: I spend far too long watching the battles ranking, writing off code changes based on a few pointless matches cheering my icon past the language/country #1s.
 Michael_Howard: I gotta cut that out.
 putibuzu: 60 I would count as top :D impressive
 putibuzu: yeah watching battles is addictive :D
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 AshamanCooper: Bronze was easier to code than wood for the green circle lol. 
 struct: thats because you know the rules now
 Astrobytes: (or more of them at least :P )
 struct: I'm a bit tired today, haven't coded much
 jacek: how important is to not have technical debt :thinking:
 struct: No idea
 Scarfield: yea, getting out of wood was particularly hard for this one, im finally on my way to bronze 
 AshamanCooper: no because the movement was easier to build a logic path for than the procedural method I used to beat wood.. still not really sure of a strategy. 
 Scarfield: depends on your card count
 AshamanCooper: How hard is this challenge? I started learning to code just two months ago. While I have spent the last 3 days working on this, and it is hard, I think I am not doing too bad. 
 struct: I would say hard
 putibuzu: yep
 jacek: its relatively hard
 struct: from 0-10 like an 7-8
 Uljahn: agreed
 jacek: many rules (and many fixes)
 AshamanCooper: awesome.
 putibuzu: and serious randomness :D
 Scarfield: and a statement thats not as clear as could be
 AshamanCooper: No changes for silver? Can we expect it to stay the same now?
 putibuzu: yes
 putibuzu: it stays the same from bronze on
 Scarfield: jebus, only 80 wins / 5 losses for this submit so far, everythin else i did before was terrible xD
 AshamanCooper: sweet
 struct: nice Scarfield are you going straight to silver?
 Scarfield: doubt it, new rules&#160;:'(
 struct: ah right
 struct: at least now you can test with all rules
 struct: Which is very important
 Scarfield: yup&#160;!
 struct: is it possible to start with 4 bonus in hand?
 Michael_Howard: Yes
 struct: Thanks
 Michael_Howard: 1/16 chance presumably.
 ClockSort: does Green Circle have a rules PDF?
 Astrobytes: nope
 struct: I have an image but its probably outdated by now
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg</a>
 ClockSort: I have to join to know what it is? haha
 struct: There are a few tweaks 
 struct: on new statement
 struct: and I dont feel like print screening again :p
 ClockSort: heh
 ClockSort: is it a good challenge?
 struct: Hard rules
 ClockSort: looks like fairly complex rules
 struct: I mean hard to understand
 struct: Yeah
 struct: But I think its fun
 Astrobytes: yeah, but a decent game
 Scarfield: its an interesting game sure, but its somewhat diffucult to get into, i didnt like it for the first few days tbh.
 ClockSort: seems like Dominion
 Astrobytes: It's Samsara, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://okaluda.fr/samsara-le-jeu/">https://okaluda.fr/samsara-le-jeu/</a>
 AshamanCooper: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/X1-07vdRFVw">https://youtu.be/X1-07vdRFVw</a>
 ClockSort: oh nice. apparently Samsara seems like Dominion :D
 Astrobytes: Possible, I've never played Dominion
 Astrobytes: Or Samsara :P
 struct: I'm almost hitting 2k lines
 struct: :D
 struct: Soon it will pass Fantastic bits bot
 ClockSort: that's pretty heavy
 ClockSort: how's the visualizer?
 Scarfield: poor you, Mr first action bronze xD
 Astrobytes: lol, my FB bot is one of my smallest :D
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/green-circle/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/green-circle/leaderboard</a>
 struct: You can check there ClockSort
 struct: It's pretty hard to tell what's happeniing
 struct: But once you understand the game it gets easier
 Westicles: heh heh, silver look at that
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 ClockSort: struct thanks, looks kind of fun&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I found another bug: when discard pile is emptied, it's not given in the inputs
 Scarfield: i dont think thats a bug though, its a card location without cards
 darkhorse64: That's debatable but the workaround is easy so I won't make a fuss
 struct: So if you dont clear your discard pile you will have problems I guess
 struct: I think I do clear it
 Nerchio: yeah I encountered this and started clearing my pile
 darkhorse64: funny enough, my bot performs better with the bug
 Scarfield: "cardLocationsCount for the amount of locations where the players have some cards. " its intended, but mildly annoying
 MSmits: memset(cardLocations, 0, 70 * sizeof(int));
 darkhorse64: and fasten your seat belts
 Scarfield: 14th in bronze, almost thought i would pass through to silver 
 MSmits: you know whats annoying
 MSmits: when you're good at picking initial values for params
 struct: Tell us
 Scarfield: sounds horrible
 MSmits: then you fit them and you notice that they are exactly right and you get no improvement
 struct: Im gonna tell you a secret
 struct: You should add more features to the eval
 Scarfield: "shitty superpowers"
 MSmits: i am doing that too
 darkhorse64: I happen all the time for me, I spend 4 hours tweaking my MCTS exploration parameter to find out the initial value was the best
 MSmits: some dont work though
 struct: You guys tweak mcts exploration?
 struct: what
 darkhorse64: not here
 struct: I know
 struct: I dont tweak it anywhere
 MSmits: usually 1.0 is best, if you use -1,0,1 for loss/draw/win
 struct: I just pick 1.0f
 MSmits: it's more difficult for an eval instead of a WLD situation
 struct: Sometimes I pick one random from 0.5 to 1.25
 MSmits: the thing is, there is a pretty large plateu
 Scarfield: you dont use something approaching sart(2)&#160;?
 Scarfield: sqrt(2) *
 MSmits: if 1.0 works, then 0.8 and 1.2 will also work
 struct: I only used 1000.0 one time
 MSmits: no, in fact that sqrt(2) is for when you are using 0, 0.5, 1.0 for WDL
 struct: to beat robo on c4
 MSmits: so, it's even worse
 MSmits: we are actually using 0.5 compared to the advertised 1.4
 struct: When his bot was weak to bad players
 Scarfield: xD struct
 putibuzu: :D
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: classy strat there :D
 struct: Its a shame that it doesnt happen the same with jacek bots
 MSmits: it's a common problem with NN. 
 Scarfield: i always used 0, 0.5, 1
 struct: I always used -1, 0, 1
 MSmits: i don't like that because it is not symmetric Scarfield
 struct: Never even though of using anything else
 MSmits: and you are forced to use a float
 MSmits: I think first time I did mcts i had 0, 1, 2
 DomiKo: imagine not using score = -score
 Scarfield: when i first made mcts, i found the -1 complicating things, never changed my approach xD
 MSmits: yeah it's annoying
 struct: Why does it complicate?
 MSmits: the -1 version is similar to negamax
 MSmits: which is much prettier than ordinary minimax
 struct: dont you just need to do what DomiKo said?
 struct: on backprop
 Scarfield: probably, never though about it, just went with 0, 0.5, 1 xD
 Scarfield: whatever float your boat :p
 struct: I would make a playground for mcts but I dont really understand the theory of it
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: Finally won my old bot
 Illedan: as p1
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 struct: you made me open the leaderboard
 struct: ...
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Oh, my old bot beats me 5 - 0 as p1
 struct: What happens if I have more architecture study than cards in total
 struct: Im imagining a possible bug
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: there is a check
 struct: oh
 Illedan: simply stops to draw
 Scarfield: gn folks&#160;:)
 Illedan: Sleep?
 MSmits: gn
 ClockSort: gn
 Illedan: gn
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn
 emh: gn
 Illedan: emh, broke your bot?
 emh: all the time
 Illedan: ^^
 emh: nahh I just set it to release everything it can if opponent already has released one. didn't work out
 emh: tried it because I got a win against The_Duck using it
 Illedan: classic 1 game verification
 emh: that's what I do. I choose a losing replay and change things until I win then resubmit
 Illedan: :D
 emh: this game is a nirvana for heuristics. I'm glad I don't have to think too hard, like with sim and search. hehe
 Illedan: Indeed
 Illedan: dangerous
 Illedan: Initial submit of search is not too bad
 Paroni: yeah, my bot is heuristics as well, let's see how I'll be able to hang on once I copy the strategies from the leading bots. It's fun actually doing well ^^.
 Illedan: Hmm, I need to automate this param fiddling
 Astrobytes: teach the kid what to do :D
 Astrobytes: *that's* real automation!
 struct: im not even sure if my brute force works
 struct: Ill probably try it again tomorrow
 Illedan: I haven't got time until wedensday&#160;:(
 emh: that's tomorrow
 emh: ohh yeah because it's after midnight
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: I wish
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: Time for bed now emh
 emh: haha is that sage advice?
 Astrobytes: sounded like a direct order :D
 Illedan: Can't do good heuristics on this side of midnight
 Illedan: I'll go sleep anyway. 150 for initial sim push is ok-
 Illedan: gn
 Astrobytes: gn
 emh: gn
 ClockSort: I don't think I have time to join Green Circle, as I'm studying for an Azure certification test next week.
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey ClockSort, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 2 tacos
 ClockSort: have fun, all!
 Astrobytes: good luck with the test ClockSort

 MuriloLopes: Hello, I have a question, I am currently doing the "ASCII Art" practice and have all but one of my test cases working. I am unsure of what I am supposed to replace the spaces in "MAN HAT TAN" to, could anyone tell me?
 MuriloLopes: Sorry, I got it. I was being silly in my code.
 KINGKRINKLES124: hello guys
 KINGKRINKLES124: :grin:
 KINGKRINKLES124: :grin:
 xMerlinx: Hi
 KINGKRINKLES124: hello
 KINGKRINKLES124: :yin_yang:
 xMerlinx: Someone know whats is in test 04 in CGX Formatter? I probably test for all characters and code work good. Only this one test is on red.
 xMerlinx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/cgx-formatter">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/cgx-formatter</a>
 KINGKRINKLES124: idk
 KINGKRINKLES124: i can try to look
 xMerlinx: of course i think of test after click 'Submit'
 KINGKRINKLES124: thx
 KINGKRINKLES124: mostly blocks and simple key values 
 Mehdi_Moulati: i  guess it like an array
 KINGKRINKLES124: YEAH!
 Mehdi_Moulati: let say that you have n items 
 KINGKRINKLES124: :thumbsup:
 Mehdi_Moulati: n-1 item should end with&#160;;
 Mehdi_Moulati: and the last one without&#160;;
 xMerlinx: I mean, test 'Simple string of characters which must not be modified'
 Mehdi_Moulati: the text inside ' ' must not be modified
 xMerlinx: yes, and i test for all character and my porgram work fine
 Mehdi_Moulati: what does you program display in the output&#160;?
 xMerlinx: I have problem with test from "Validators"
 Mehdi_Moulati: ahh
 Mehdi_Moulati: i got it
 xMerlinx: All test in "Test case" my program passed
 Mehdi_Moulati: what if they change the block start /endin validator
 KINGKRINKLES124: sorry if i didnt help you :sweat:

 Bernard_Lowe: Why is there a huge global competition just months after Spring 2022? My friends and I are too burnt out from that.
 Bernard_Lowe: I mean, this is a good thing, but my expectation is only 1 large competition a year here.
 linjoehan: ping
 Riumuru: hello
 pedrosorio: Bernard_Lowe lol
 jacek: there used to be more, like 2,3 per year + community contests
 j4at: yeah we need more contests.(that are a little bit less complicated then this one)
 j4at: than*

 francisdbillones: is the test case wrong?
 francisdbillones: I think the test case is wrong.
 dbdr: 99.9% of the time, when people say that, the test is not wrong
 francisdbillones: I am using a kinematic equation to solve this, and it is most certainly correct.
 dbdr: what are you solving?
 dbdr: this is a general chat
 francisdbillones: What do you mean?
 francisdbillones: Ah, how do I share the question?
 dbdr: is it a clash?
 francisdbillones: Yes
 francisdbillones: Is it okay with you if I simply paste the statement?
 dbdr: sure
 francisdbillones: A rocket is launched at the speed of 1 m/s and has a constant acceleration of 2 m/s^2.Wich means that every seconds, its speed increase by 2 m/s.This rocket reaches its goal in n seconds.Print the distance (in m) traveled by the rocket.
 dbdr: not promising anything. but at least we'll know what this is about&#160;:)
 francisdbillones: The kinematic equation I used to solve this is distance = v_0 * t + (1/2)*a*t^2
 francisdbillones: is the initial velocity is simply 1 we can simplify this todistance = t + (1/2) * a * t^2
 francisdbillones: as the acceleration is 2 we can get rid of the fraction
 francisdbillones: distance = t + t^2
 francisdbillones: But reverse engineering the given test case, they are expecting t^2 only
 francisdbillones: Perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the initial velocity was 0.
 dbdr: this is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/62194d9a31d1f7c16f2b29cc7f62fc6214c4">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/62194d9a31d1f7c16f2b29cc7f62fc6214c4</a>
 dbdr: yeah, it's not well formulated
 francisdbillones: Ah, they misled me with the "constant acceleration".
 dbdr: "Wich means that every seconds, its speed increase by 2 m/s."
 francisdbillones: Turns out it's discrete and not continuous, rendering the equation wrong
 francisdbillones: Thanks for the clarification!
 dbdr: indeed
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: strange, the contribution cannot be edited
 jacek: happy Caturday
 aCat: happy ^^
 Marchete: happy caturday :smiley_cat:
 emh: meow
 StevensGino: Hi all
 StevensGino: does any have the code of mars-lander?
 StevensGino: It seems like bug to me for the numbers output by the game
 StevensGino: so I want to check how it is implement?
 jacek: there no referee?
 StevensGino: it is optimazation
 StevensGino: so no referee
 MACKEYTH: The lander engine tracks everything in floating point, but only reports integers
 StevensGino: yeah, I just think about this
 StevensGino: thanks, let me try again
 MACKEYTH: I'm not sure how things are rounded, or if everything is rounded the same way
 StevensGino: thank you
 StevensGino: I don't see, in the description anything about game tracking in float&#160;:(
 jacek: try discussions
 MACKEYTH: I don't think it does say anything about it in the desc. I have found that kinematic equations produce accurate results over many turns, allowing for rounding the initial figures.
 StevensGino: Oh, I just retest with everything in floating point, It works :D
 StevensGino: so we might playing the game by ignoring all the input after turn 1&#160;:(
 MACKEYTH: Give it a shot&#160;:)
 jacek: thats normal for games. ignore the input (or just print it) and see if your simulation matches
 StevensGino: it just weird to me, for other games, I often try to make my code adapt/rounding so I can find the input of next turn
 StevensGino: but everything have 1st time, I think
 Blacklion96: hi
 Chinnuvrs: hi
 Chinnuvrs: I am having  a problem with Coders Strike back  can anyone explain to me the 180 degree
 TobiasA: oi
 Ayamecho: hello
 dbdr: sure, but not with floats
 MSmits: nah, but isnt inf always just some large number 
 MSmits: you can just halve that&#160;:)
 dbdr: floats have real infinities
 MSmits: oh really... well dont do that :P
 dbdr: and -INF/2 == -INF
 MSmits: i see
 MSmits: did not know
 MSmits: i usually just have minus 16k or something
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://floating-point-gui.de/">https://floating-point-gui.de/</a>

 MSmits: lol ofc there is a meme
 dbdr: floats your bot?
 MSmits: works
 MSmits: mmh was discussing hashing for mcts last night, now i want to try it for C4
 MSmits: seems in late game branching is very small, hashing states might be worth it
 dbdr: in late game the game is over, no? I guess you mean just before that
 geppoz: dbdr where did you get that quote from?
 MSmits: i mean late game in the tree
 MSmits: could be just after midgame in reality
 dbdr: geppoz <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 dbdr: right
 geppoz: ty
 MSmits: could maybe do on expansion: if depth &gt; 30 or something
 jacek: that paper :scream:
 MSmits: and then use TT
 MSmits: whatever you do, dont use the pseudo code
 dbdr: is it bad jacek&gt;
 MSmits: just the ideas geppoz&#160;:)
 dbdr:&#160;?
 MSmits: the ideas are good
 jacek: pseudocode is meh and too many pages for something that can be described in 2 sentences
 mhpd: ok
 geppoz: (there is some messy with pages? numbered to 36 but only 12? that is an extract?)
 jacek: maybe its from journal
 dbdr: starts at 25
 jacek: anyway, wheneve i say im using vanilla mcts, the mcts solver is implied
 jacek: or rather, it is not nn one
 MSmits: btw, it seems to me that if you use a NN you can also do some heavy expansion pruning (based on logic)
 MSmits: I do a very heavy rollout in uttt, but it's all safe pruning. It is very expensive though, but with NN that is negligible
 MSmits: heavy expansion that is
 MSmits: you could make your bot solve better if you did this too
 MSmits: things like, don't consider moves that if you make them give your opponent the opportunity to finish 3 in a row on some row of boards
 MSmits: dont expand those... then you dont have to run them through your nn
 MSmits: maybe you already do, i dont know
 geppoz: well, I think I will first try a "normal" MCTS, then this solver...
 jacek: maybe
 MSmits: thats a good idea, the same kind of sign bugs you get with mcts, also happen with solver
 struct: yeah its a better idea
 struct: its what I did 
 struct: solver was pretty simple after mcts was working
 MSmits: jacek, not sure how it is with you, but reCurs e's uttt NN, last time i checked, sometimes makes poor choices in the very late game, because solving is hard for NN's
 MSmits: too few rollouts
 MSmits: so its opponents play perfectly, but the nn can't, it can just play very well, but occasionally makes a mistake
 MSmits: recurs e also had this problem with othello
 MSmits: anyway, so i think anything that may help you solve 1 or 2 plies sooner, might make it stronger
 jacek: yeah, my most recent increase in strength comes from the fact i nearly doubled the rollouts
 MSmits: cool, though that may just as well have something to do with performance earlier in the game ofc
 MSmits: doesnt have to be the solving
 MSmits: though with twice the rollouts it will definitely solve sooner
 MSmits: this is also why i think you should go and code a oware endgame book and beat robo with it :P
 MSmits: I think it's sad only tric trac seems to use it. Endgame books are fun 
 Butanium: I don't know if you saw but my first version of my MCTS for connect 4 reached rank 22 MSmits&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: oh, gj Butanium
 MSmits: then it works. Mcts is all or nothing
 Butanium: thanks&#160;!
 Butanium: I'll try to add some eval before the end of the game
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: how?
 MSmits: like early playout termination?
 Butanium: like depth for rollout max 10 or 20
 Butanium: yes
 MSmits: havent tried that for C4
 MSmits: normally i do use that
 darkhorse64: msmits: i saw you resubmit. "Grimoire" version or spam push&#160;?
 Butanium: For now I'm building my local version of the Connect 4
 Butanium: so that I can test my different AI against each other
 MSmits: this has grimoire, I wanted to test the unicode compression
 MSmits: it's Chinese now
 Butanium: What did you do which is specific to C4 MSmits?
 MSmits: avoid losing moves in the rollout
 MSmits: i mean thats not specific to C4, but the implementation is
 MSmits: so dont playa move, if the opponent can then win the game on next turn
 Butanium: just in rollout&#160;? Don't you expend your tree with this condition too?
 MSmits: yeah i do
 Butanium: Ok that was what I planned too
 MSmits: just be careful that you need a check before outputting a final move
 MSmits: your root might not have children&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I have a good score against it. The previous grimoire had better spells
 Butanium: ahah yes
 MSmits: lol darkhorse64, thats the risk of using it. 
 MSmits: it becomes deterministic, like those NN's
 Butanium: whay is this "grimoire"&#160;? :eyes:
 MSmits: opening book
 Butanium: ok
 MSmits: hardcoded moves
 Butanium: I guess you generate them from some experimentations?
 MSmits: current has 9974 moves. a lot less, meta mcts switched branches somewhere
 MSmits: Butanium yes locally
 Butanium: how do you do that exactly&#160;? You make stats from a lot of game? 
 MSmits: I play a meta mcts that, instead of a random rollout, plays a game
 MSmits: like the ones you play on CG
 MSmits: then i backprop the stats
 struct: how many nodes do you have in total?
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: aw crap i cant even select my forms output, its refreshing to fast, lemme make a screenshot
 Butanium: what do you mean by "plays a gamelike the ones you play on CG"
 MSmits: same calc time more or less, per turn
 jacek: instead of random simulation, you run another mcts
 jacek: this simulation is more accurate then
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/Xk0Vhd3">https://imgur.com/a/Xk0Vhd3</a>
 MSmits: ignore the fact that move 1 says 56%, it's majorly skewed because of that dangerous draw solve thing we discussed earlier
 MSmits: it should be 50%
 MSmits: I fixed it just now by checking for available drawn choices on backprop, but takes a long time to get back to 50% 
 dbdr: ah ok, was making me think it's a P2 win with steal
 MSmits: yeah, no, somewhere at ply 14 i have a solved draw and it keeps selecting the lost siblings  because they arent solved
 dbdr: I mean the solved value
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: status = 2 means ongoing
 dbdr: yeah, in the metamcts, you can certainly make the search "expensive" without consequences
 MSmits: yeah thats nice, in some games you can go nuts with transpositions
 MSmits: in uttt, i consider many boards that look completely different as identical
 MSmits: won miniboards by different rows and such
 MSmits: this way i can compress the state to below 128 bit as well
 MSmits: very expensive to do, but as you say, no consequences
 struct: thats on meta right?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: in uttt, you can describe a miniboard with a number between 0 and 8629
 MSmits: which is less than half what you would get with ternary representation
 MSmits: and around 15 times less than binary
 MSmits: in a live bot thats nuts though
 MSmits: and then of course you can rotate, mirror stuff as well
 MSmits: 8629^9  &lt; 128 bit
 struct: crazy stuff
 MSmits: yeah, I plan to write a tech.io article about these 3 systems for uttt
 MSmits: noone else seems to use anything other than binary. I think Robo did ternary for while
 dbdr: I think I use ternary
 MSmits: oh cool
 MSmits: for lookups then
 MSmits: to lookup miniboard eval
 MSmits: precalculated, right?
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: i did that before as well, i managed a minimax bot that got to top 20 or so
 MSmits: but c++, so your eval is better
 IvesL: would it be great if we can create a competition based on connect 4 but in 3D
 Nerchio: how do you organize c4 in bits when you can't fit that + a free row into 64 bits?
 MSmits: why do you need a free row?
 Nerchio: for victory checks
 MSmits: oh you're using one of those examples for 6 x 7?
 Nerchio: i think
 MSmits: I did not use those
 Nerchio: well i am not using anything yet
 Nerchio: :D
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Nerchio: just seeing how it can be done
 MSmits: well I check with simd in 4 directions at once
 MSmits: but could be looped i suppose
 Nerchio: what is simd?
 MSmits: avx
 MSmits: using a big register to do multiple operations at the same time
 MSmits: 256 bit, so 4 x 64 bit
 kovi: i was out of the loopyou guys mean that solving draw makes more bad than good?
 MSmits: 4 directions
 MSmits: kovi no not necessarily, but it can lead to some bias. Doesnt have to affect winrate
 MSmits: just try it i would say
 MSmits: the problem is when you do selection and you have a choice between solved draws and other unfinished children, you might be selecting losses over and over
 MSmits: but generally draws solve very late, so this doesnt have to be a big issue
 MSmits: and you can experiment with ways to fix this problem. There's many approaches I guess
 kovi: thx
 MSmits: I usually just ignore it, but it was skewing my meta mcts, so i just fixed it
 jrke: so c4is also getting popular like D&amp;B
 MSmits: puzzle of the week helps&#160;:)
 jrke: yeah
 MSmits: kovi, just coded the mcts hash thingy for c4
 MSmits: testing it now, not seeing much difference
 MSmits: running games vs robo in IDE, to see what ply it solves at
 bitbitthebunny: @JaguarTordu
 JaguarTordu:&#160;?
 darkhorse64: MSmits: is your simd wincheck faster than the scalar one&#160;? I wrote a private playground to check my implementation and my scalar is 4x faster
 MSmits: I dont know. I would have to write a scalar one
 MSmits: let me see if thats hard to do
 darkhorse64: I can give you mine 
 struct: thats a bit strange darkhorse64
 MSmits: please do darkhorse64
 MSmits: i hope it fits into my bot
 darkhorse64: This is why I ask the question: you can conclude I suck badly
 MSmits: does your winningmoves thingy give a bitboard with bits set where winning moves are?
 MSmits: thats what mine does
 struct: the slower operation should be setting the values of the register

 1rre: I might completely rewrite my UTTT bot, currently I've got something which 1st looks for a move which meets certain conditions, then has about 10 fallbacks (none of which actually include the big board because idk, my backend would support it but I can't be bothered filtering the moves), but I feel like a scoring system would be better

 PiterYeh: hello everyone
 blindo: Hi!
 PiterYeh: did anybody have timeout issues in a specific test case for space maze, the solo puzzle?
 blindo: Not here
 PiterYeh: sigh... i have random timeouts in a test case, and also in a validation case
 PiterYeh: i should have a time budget of 50ms, but according to my times i get killed for timeout by CG after 30... 20... sometimes 7 ms
 blindo: Maybe there are some admins or whatever they're called here to help you out. I hope
 blindo: Sounds like a shitty problem to have&#160;:/
 KiwiTae: PiterYeh which puzzle?
 Westicles: do you start your timer after inputs are read?
 PiterYeh: KiwiTae space maze
 PiterYeh: Westicles i start my timer right after the first input of every turn
 PiterYeh: blindo yeah it's been driving me crazy for the last 40 minutes, so here i am asking the community :D
 Westicles: should start after last input I think
 KiwiTae: time starts when u start reading inputs
 KiwiTae: but maybe u just have a while loop smwhere
 KiwiTae: or a crash
 KiwiTae: usually tells you timeout even its crashing 
 therealbeef: crashes are the most typical reason for unexpected timeouts
 PiterYeh: hmmmm so maybe it's just a crash huh
 PiterYeh: good point
 PiterYeh: thanks, i'll go and try to see if it's because of that&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: id say run it of cg ide with gdb if your in cpp dunno
 KiwiTae: i usually do that
 therealbeef: maybe those turns which timeout have something in common with respect to the inputs or game state
 PiterYeh: yeah yeah i have my debugger already set up! if it's a crash i should quickly find out why
 PiterYeh: brb
 PiterYeh: damn... i think i run out of memory
 PiterYeh: if i recall correctly CG allows around 750MB of ram
 PiterYeh: and my algo only finds the solution after eating 927MB of ram :D quite hungry
 PiterYeh: thanks for the help, i was just stuck!
 KiwiTae: now time to fix it&#160;:")
 KiwiTae:&#160;:*
 LelouchVC2: fixing is gay
 LelouchVC2: code it right the first time
 blindo: Fixing is gay? lol..
 blindo: Not only is your comment condescending, it's also homophobic. I don't really care, but it doesn't cost anything not to be an ass..
 LelouchVC2: why is it homophobic? u should be gay more often by fixing code
 KiwiTae: :rainbow:
 therealbeef: where's a mod when you need one...
 blindo: So the word gay got its connotation to same sex relations in mid 1900 sometimes
 blindo: Are you really referring to the meaning of the word more than 70 years ago?

 Boman: I just went to google it... but yep - it's in the comments
 Boman: as a side note, you can still just print it and it will show... you'll get the "debug" info but your test will fail too.
 dtator: I'm running CSB and trying to store the checkpoint x,y so just outputting wouldn't work
 KiwiTae: dtator use variables?
 dtator: I know how to store it, was just confused how to output debug messages to confirm it was working correctly
 FrancoRoura: Has anyone been able to reach depth 3 on a minimax for connect4 using Python (Without timing out)?

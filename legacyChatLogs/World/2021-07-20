 jacek: RoboStac 2nd? w00t
 dbdr: killed by royale apparently
 dbdr: no, mostly Marchete
 ericlovesmath: I joined like 2 days ago and I have no idea what's happening
 ericlovesmath: but now I'm in position 108 for Clash
 KiwiTae: now get 108 in general ranking :nerd:
 ericlovesmath: dear god no I'm just fast at typing, doesn't mean I'm any good at actual programming
 ericlovesmath: only reason I'm here is because of those 30 second questions
 ericlovesmath: don't need to know... algorithms and... actually study data structures for most of those

 Marchete: o/
 anoukiiii: :avocado:
 derjack: robo struggling?
 Marchete: my only hope is that he tie more with Royale
 Marchete: nvm :D
 RoboStac: tried to make it slightly less deterministic so it doesn't get stuck on one result 
 Marchete: mine it's fully RPS
 Marchete: it seems
 Marchete: it's all in or all out
 RoboStac: there's lots of different games vs you now at least
 RoboStac: but I think the start is still pretty fixed
 RoboStac: so they end up the same
 RoboStac: just with slightly different lengths / final scores
 derjack: use more random in start and less later
 Marchete: you can't
 Marchete: at least not from stats
 Marchete: the problem is the fixed start
 Marchete: less diversity
 Marchete: ...and I'm out
 Marchete: I'm sick of oware
 derjack: oO
 Marchete: so ugly rules
 derjack: are you planning cgzero of other games
 Marchete: after all the work I put on it
 Marchete: I'm not 100% sure my sim is correct
 Marchete: like endgame is tricky
 Marchete: probably derjack, C4 seems fine
 Marchete: but after reviewing it
 Marchete: a Conv layer is just a Dense layer with less weights
 martinpapa69: I observed a lot a repleys, where the bot is winning, and in the last step:sudden draw
 Marchete: on what game martinpapa69?
 martinpapa69: oware
 Marchete: for me what I see if that my tree node reuse is near 0% I'm dead
 Marchete: it's probably an unexplored section
 Marchete: so it will play badly
 martinpapa69: ye, I've seen that too, might be a bug
 Marchete: probably
 anoukiiii: PROBABLY
 anoukiiii: YES
 celxin: helllo
 anoukiiii: eyo
 anoukiiii: whats up
 celxin: anouk can we be friends
 anoukiiii: yes
 anoukiiii: best freinds
 celxin: yeahh
 martinpapa69: now what im trying is is to train a bigger network. generate a lot of replays
 martinpapa69: and train a smaller net using only those
 anoukiiii: thats a good idea
 celxin: matrinpapa are you german
 Marchete: matrinpapa is Spaniard right now
 Marchete:&#160;;)
 anoukiiii: :kissing_heart:
 martinpapa69: ye, I had to move to Spain
 anoukiiii: ooh
 Marchete: :D
 celxin: oh 
 anoukiiii: we love you
 IcyOwl: that's nice
 Marchete:&#160;:*
 celxin: but you are a german in spain?
 celxin: marchete shut up 
 anoukiiii: dont be sad
 anoukiiii: go get a tattooo
 anoukiiii: help me
 anoukiiii: mars lander ep 1
 celxin: wuuuuaaah
 Tiramon: whats your problem?
 anoukiiii: im in schoolo
 celxin: tell us the solution
 Tiramon: you wish ..
 anoukiiii: we need help
 anoukiiii: och
 anoukiiii: mensch
 anoukiiii: dunmmkopf
 Tiramon: i help with problems, but don't give out solutions =)
 anoukiiii: bad vibe
 celxin: arsch
 anoukiiii: :sob:
 anoukiiii: oha
 anoukiiii: you kicked my freind celine
 anoukiiii: i have problem
 Tiramon: sure .. you want to join him?
 anoukiiii: girl
 anoukiiii: noo
 anoukiiii: i want help
 anoukiiii:&#160;:(
 Tiramon: her ... doesn't matter ... people that can't behave are not needed in this chat
 anoukiiii: whats your fucking problem
 anoukiiii: arschpupser
 Marchete: banhammer
 Tiramon: ok school kids are gone ... the chat is yours&#160;;)
 Marchete: :clap_tone2:
 derjack: potw notification so late now
 darkhorse64: less cp
 Thyl: HellOo&#160;?
 Thyl:&#160;:)
 Tiramon: hm maybe i'll also spend some time again to train my oware nn
 Marchete: do you also had a NN framework?
 Marchete: have*
 Tiramon: my submit in oware is a NN .. it still has some major flaws
 Tiramon: didn't train it that much yet
 swapbee: hello friends
 Tiramon: it's a nice small fully connected 12,64,64,6 network
 martinpapa69: you dont have a value head&#160;?
 derjack: 12?
 Thyl: why didn't do a 12 64 64 12 6
 Thyl:&#160;???
 Tiramon: size 12 input layer,  2 hidden layers with 64 neurones and a output layer with 6 values
 Thyl: 64-&gt;6 is a very big difference
 Tiramon: because it was more or less working Thyl&#160;;)
 derjack: 12 inputs? only houses, no score?
 RoboStac: the best move is the same no matter what the score is so if you aren't doing a search on with a value output the score isn't relevant
 RoboStac: turn probably becomes important at that point though
 Thyl: Your submit is good RoboStac&#160;!
 derjack: Tiramon working? youre 173 :v
 Tiramon: as i said it has some flaws ... didn't pass wood 2 boss because he always made moves my nn couldn't handle&#160;;)
 Tiramon: i lost interest in training it and was 2nd in wood 2 for quite some time
 Tiramon: now i got pushed to wood 1
 Tiramon: and yes in wood 1 it could definitly perform better
 TeBounty: Hello
 Benedikt.Huber: Hi&#160;:)
 dbdr: RoboStac&gt; the best move is the same no matter what the scoreI don't think that's true
 dbdr: e.g. a move that gives 2 points to the opp then 10 points to you in the next two turns
 dbdr: it's good, unless the opp has 23+pts
 RoboStac: if you ignore turn limits then every seed has to come off the board so either +8 is the best you can do (and the opponent will always get at least 2 seeds and win) or it wasn't the best move. 
 Wontonimo: hi TeBounty and Benedikt.Huber
 Benedikt.Huber: Wontonimo &lt;3
 derjack: :thinking:
 Marchete: :rolling_eyes:
 Wontonimo: you two have such fragile masculinity ... free love people, free love 
 sprkrd: Hello lovely people :D
 Wontonimo: :joy:
 Wontonimo: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: so, what's the topic of the day?
 sprkrd: love indeed
 Marchete: beards, chainsaw models and fragile masculinity
 Wontonimo: i need a chainsaw actually
 Wontonimo: i've got a bunch of fallen trees i need to buck then split
 Wontonimo: i need a splitter also
 Marchete: and manicure too
 Wontonimo: yeah, after i'll need that
 Wontonimo: cuz those woodchips and sap are a nightmare 
 sprkrd: so you're a bulky and rough lumberjack?
 Wontonimo: lol
 Marchete: the mountonimo
 sprkrd: Mandatory video: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FshU58nI0Ts">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FshU58nI0Ts</a>
 Wontonimo: Marchete looks like your NN wirtup is getting a lot of people on the wagon!!  Awesome 
 Wontonimo: Nice video sprkrd, and yes it is mandatory
 Wontonimo: WAIT, those are Canadian Royal Mounties.  I never noticed that before
 Marchete: :steam_locomotive::railway_car::railway_car::railway_car::railway_car::railway_car:
 sprkrd: I like one of the comments: "As a Canadian I find this deeply offensive, misrepresentative, and quite frankly insulting. I have many friends who are lumberjacks and only half of them are transvestites"
 derjack: canadian royal ponies?
 Marchete: I choo choo choose you!
 Marchete: the more NN, the harder it's to stay on top...
 Marchete: now top10 oware is NN
 derjack: we need another breakthrough to NN
 Wontonimo: a public contribution of computationally efficient Conv 
 Wontonimo: for CG
 Marchete: for CG?
 Marchete: I reviewed it
 Wontonimo:&#160;!!
 Marchete: in the end a Conv is just a Dense with less weights
 The_Camoflauged: I just realised that unity uses C-sharp
 Wontonimo: yes, of course it is
 Marchete: then?
 Marchete: It's slower than Dense, but because it's "bigger"
 Marchete: you can review it in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a>
 Wontonimo:&#160;!! oh&#160;!!  Awesome 
 martinpapa69: would be nice to build a mini opensource nn lib, just for cg, that later is added to the cg server and you can include it to your file
 Marchete: I did some tests and it slower than Dense, but faster than vanilla
 Marchete: then they should add proper frameworks
 Wontonimo: slower as in 10x10-&gt;5x5 is slower than 10x10-c-&gt;5x5&#160;?
 martinpapa69: ye or they could just add support for tensorflow
 Marchete: I prefer that
 Wontonimo: yeah, that would make the cost of entry a lot lower
 Marchete: Wontonimo I don't know how to measure sample inference time in new TF versions
 Marchete: but my MNIST CNN was 20usec/sample
 Marchete: my TF was saying 676usec
 Marchete: but maybe I wasn't measuring the same thing
 Marchete: check images on github
 Marchete: I did evaluate(batch_size=1)
 Wontonimo: yeah, i don't really know what TF 676us/step means, probably batch
 Wontonimo: I'd guess that is a fairly accurate comparison and that your implementation just may be 30x faster
 Marchete: I don't think so
 Wontonimo: but tensorflow flow really shines with larger batches and network sizes on GPU
 Wontonimo: cpu isn't its "thing"
 Marchete: just the opposite than CG
 Wontonimo: and you don't have any bloatware in yours
 Wontonimo: so, it's believable imo
 Wontonimo: even their cpu version is optimized for larger batches.  in production at work, i use batches of 200 on cpu because it is only 1/2 the speed of single item inference.
 Wontonimo: so 100x faster to batch 200 on tensorflow with cpu
 Wontonimo: for my particular network
 Wontonimo: (don't ask why we arnt running on gpu :unamused:)
 martinpapa69: I dont think if you wrote an nn inference lib it would run any faster on cpu
 martinpapa69: tf might contain a lot of bloatware, and for general use, but im sure they optimized the s* out of it
 Marchete: I disagree
 Wontonimo: the model is 300mb.  So, you have to move the entire model from RAM through the cpu.  If you do 200 items at a time, then you only move that model once through the bus
 Marchete: counterexample, one hots
 derjack: :fire:
 0x15FQ: shit
 Marchete: :digit_one::fire:
 Wontonimo: :2: :fire:
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 martinpapa69: ye Marchete, in few special cases it can be faster. Wontonimo if your model doesnt change, why would you reinitalize it&#160;?
 Marchete: then "I dont think if you wrote an nn inference lib it would run any faster on cpu" maybe it's not true
 Wontonimo: it isn't reinitalized :puzzled-and-confused:
 Marchete: I'm sure Robo's NN is 2-3x the TF
 Bari: sus
 martinpapa69: thats sick tho 
 martinpapa69: maybe than I should say, I (and 99% of community) cant write faster inference :D
 martinpapa69: Wontonimo why do you have to move the model in the ram, if you dont reinitalize it&#160;?
 RoboStac: tf doesn't optimise for the same use cases we have, I'm pretty sure it's fairly easy to outperform it on single inferences with small networks
 Wontonimo: i don't have gpu (in this env), it doesn't fit in L3, and keeping it on disk would be way too slow.
 Wontonimo: to do any calculation with it, the values have to move from ram, across the bus, load into the cpu
 Marchete: it's like vanilla MCTS, if you try to use new, all non-fast math operations, divisions, etc it would be much slower 
 Marchete: so most top "NNers" :D surely outperforms commercial/general user NN frameworks
 Marchete: use*
 martinpapa69: if you run a batch on cpu Wontonimo, your model wont be "loaded into the cpu"
 Wontonimo: perhaps my word choice is wrong.  what i mean to say is, the model is "just a bunch of matrix operations", 300mb of them
 Wontonimo: and for each matrix to do it's operation, the values have to move across the bus
 Wontonimo: just like anything that is in ram that need to be processed by the cpu
 Wontonimo: it isn't "loaded" in some way that is different than just regular programming
 RoboStac: yeah - it probably uses the weights for the first layer on all samples before moving onto the second layer
 RoboStac: which will be a much better use of cache
 Wontonimo: it does indeed
 Wontonimo: it loads all samples as a matrix
 Wontonimo: and operates on them as one block
 RoboStac: plus I imagine theres all sorts of threading going on that scales with more data
 Wontonimo: so, instead of iterating through the 300mb of matrix operations 200x for 200 samples, it makes only 1 pass over the 300mb of matrix operations 
 martinpapa69: ah, okay i get it now. ye sure it has to be faster, to run batches on cpu, rather than running 1by1
 Wontonimo: i mean, it would be way better to use a GPU here
 Marchete: gaming
 Wontonimo: i tend to make up terms as idea placeholders.  so sorry if my explination was confusing
 phsads: gmaing
 martinpapa69: ye, I do that too :D many times ppl dont understand what im talking about
 Wontonimo: so, we needed the "next level" of nn, and boom Marchete you pre-deliver conv
 Wontonimo: what's next?  voxels?
 Marchete: it seems conv is not that useful on CG
 Marchete: or at least it doesn't seem to
 Marchete: environment is tiny, so not much to improve
 Marchete: probably nnue or similar approaches
 Marchete: or anything better than alphazero
 RoboStac: yava / breakthrough I have much better results with conv 
 Wontonimo: i would think breakthrough would benefit a lot from it
 Marchete: but not on C4
 Wontonimo: because the whole idea of conv is that what you learn in one patch is now transfered to all other patches
 specdrake: talking about CNNs?
 Marchete: yes
 RoboStac: no, c4's still awkward because of how the endgame works
 RoboStac: same with othello
 RoboStac: (though I think recurs is conv there and better than mine)
 Wontonimo: you do any CNN programming specdrake&#160;?
 specdrake: Uhm no I just know what it is. Planning to do some the coming semester.
 Wontonimo: are you familiar with dense NNs&#160;?
 derjack: i prefer BBC :V
 specdrake: yeah kind of
 Wontonimo: so, if i have 400 inputs (a 20x20 board) and I want a NN to determine if there is exists a 5x5 pattern on that board
 derjack: then use n-tuple network [solved]
 Wontonimo: nice!
 Wontonimo: you know what, a youtube video would do way better than a bit of text here
 derjack: i prefer reading
 Wontonimo: arxiv for you mr scholar 
 derjack: hmm looks interesting <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08387">https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08387</a>
 AllYourTrees: GNNs :nauseated_face:
 AllYourTrees: wow that looks interesting
 derjack: GNNs :hugging:
 Wontonimo: by training it for only three days on small Othello boards, it can defeat the AlphaZero model on a large board, which was trained to play the large board for 30 days.
 Wontonimo: x10 training speedup by being clever with training.  It's as if a good teacher makes a difference
 AllYourTrees: oooh nice and GNNs take advantage of the invariance/symmetries by default
 AllYourTrees: is what they say
 AllYourTrees: cool paper, ty for sharing derjack!!
 derjack: there was other paper on learning small boards and using for bigger boards
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09832">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09832</a>
 AllYourTrees: nice, seems like nn structure is very important
 TeBounty: I know this is not a topic for this forum but I would like to improve my English. I need someone who wants to talk with me. Please.
 Wontonimo: just talk about coding here
 derjack: English? weird programming language :v
 TeBounty: It's ok sorry. Goog day.
 TeBounty: Good*
 r0bd0g: help i dont know what im doing im in yr10 and i dont know how to code help me!!!!

 Wontonimo: hi r0bd0g

 nicola: PM is private message.
 derjack: whats PMS then
 MSmits: nulte, got time for an avx question?
 nulte: yes
 MSmits: allright here goes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c48b38f9-118b-4db5-8c2a-f70ebff07046">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c48b38f9-118b-4db5-8c2a-f70ebff07046</a>
 MSmits: I am doing a lot with those "top connection" things
 MSmits: so those can be considered a constant vector for some time
 derjack: loony tunes
 nulte: ok, i check in a minute or so
 MSmits: the first 4 lines
 MSmits: I wonder if i can parallelize the 4 shifts and &amp; 
 MSmits: i remember that shifts all need to have the same direction for this to work
 MSmits: but maybe you have an idea
 MSmits: btw the loony thing are D&amp;B boxes where you can't play a line or the opponent can fill it in&#160;:)
 nulte: ok im checking now
 nulte: so only the shifts and the ands?
 MSmits: yeah
 FriendlyKh: hi
 MSmits: hi FriendlyKh
 FriendlyKh: hi
 MSmits: you said that already
 FriendlyKh: so what do you talking about
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes</a>
 FriendlyKh: ah ok
 nulte: do you do this multiple times in the same function?
 MSmits: i do similar things with the same vector of "top connection", etc
 MSmits: it's just the first vector thats different
 MSmits: so that "two2Neighbors"
 MSmits: that one changes
 nulte: also is topConnection and other constant?
 MSmits: for example:'
 MSmits: uint64_t tF = (m.loonyFront &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; topConnection;	uint64_t bF = (m.loonyFront &lt;&lt; 8) &amp; botConnection;	uint64_t lF = (m.loonyFront &lt;&lt; 1) &amp; leftConnection;	uint64_t rF = (m.loonyFront &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; rightConnection;
 MSmits: crap lol
 MSmits: 1 line too few
 MSmits: nulte it's constant for a little while. I use it maybe 5 times
 MSmits: but not for the runtime of the program
 MSmits: whenever I play a move it may change, but after a move is played a whole analysis is done where i do multiple things of this nature
 MSmits: I mainly thing the bi-directional shifts are the problem
 MSmits: think
 RoboStac: if you've got the same shifts and ands with 4 separate inputs you could do all 4 in a vector instead of trying to vectorise them individually
 MSmits: I had to think about that one, but I think I understand what you mean
 MSmits: you mean analyzing 4 different moves at the same time, running the same function 4 times
 derjack: jeff bezos going to space eh
 MSmits: I guess that can be done
 MSmits: but really complicated
 MSmits: he can stay there
 tImProCodEr: Hello together
 MSmits: mmh nah i think this would be too messy, vectorizing the whole thing. It's a recursive situation. It would be like vectorizing a minimax algorithm
 MSmits: mmh though, if i know I am going to have to apply at least 4 moves, I could do something ahead of time maybe and just keep the analysis results on the stack
 MSmits: like simming 4 moves in a minimax, while only continuing DFS on one of them at a time
 RoboStac: so you don't have two2Neighbours and m.loonyFront at the same time?
 MSmits: ohh is that what you mean, hmm let me check
 MSmits: nope that's sequential unfortunately
 MSmits: I also have this bitboarded floodfill
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cbbeb43-b003-4f4a-8d8c-e31da9e52772">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cbbeb43-b003-4f4a-8d8c-e31da9e52772</a>
 MSmits: same thing, second vector stays constant, first vector is changing all the time
 RoboStac: yeah, same problem that the only operation you do to all 4 is 'and'  and it's probably not worth the overhead to avx them just for that.
 MSmits: I was afraid of that. Thanks for confirming. I can let that go then&#160;:)
 Shyweirdo: hey guys 
 Shyweirdo: am having problems with the first level of the bot game

 Shyweirdo: huh?
 DaNinja: ignore Blaise, whats the problem?
 BlaiseEbuth: Wut.
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't ignore me or you gonna be in trouble.
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't say to ignore me or you're also gonna be in trouble.
 Astrobytes: So ANYWAY. What is the nature of your coding emergency Shyweirdo?
 DaNinja: this chat needs a /ignore
 Shyweirdo: ok so i'm meant to win the race by edtiting a line of code to output the target position 
 Shyweirdo: sorry i
 Shyweirdo: i'm a noob 
 BlaiseEbuth: This work
 Astrobytes: we're all noobs once
 Astrobytes: That was kinda unnecessary Blaise dude
 Shyweirdo: so um anyone know how i can solve this please? 
 BlaiseEbuth: No it wasn't
 Shyweirdo: i can't like copy the entire code here lol oh wait can i just do that?
 Astrobytes: Shyweirdo: If this is the very first level, take a look at the code and see if you can see anything strange about it
 Shyweirdo: literally started playing like maybe 20 minutes ago 
 Shyweirdo: ok astrobytes 
 BlaiseEbuth: Even if I said it on a joke tone, my remark was serious. I'm tired of all this context free questions. An I'm tired of the pair of users that treat me/ and say to other to treat me as nothing more than a troll, in every situation, just because I'm speaking sarcasticly.
 BlaiseEbuth: Eat my second degree.
 jacek: Shyweirdo you need to print X and Y. the code has only X and X (or Y and Y?)
 Shyweirdo: oh woow
 Astrobytes: Yes jacek, I was trying to get him to notice for himself.
 Shyweirdo: i get it now thanks guys 
 Shyweirdo: yes i did notice after your message astro thanks 
 Shyweirdo: thanks jacek also 
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Alright, I see your point.
 Astrobytes: Ah that's good Shyweirdo
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks.
 BlaiseEbuth: And sorry for the bad vibes Shyweirdo
 jacek: BlaiseEbuth what if the question is about context-free grammar
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 pthebaul: haha jacek
 Shyweirdo: it
 Shyweirdo: it's cook Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: :cookie:
 Shyweirdo: hey guys 
 Shyweirdo: i really don't know if it's just my dumb head but i seam to be confused again 
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?
 Shyweirdo: so i'm on the decent game 
 Shyweirdo: on the algorithm tree section

 MSmits: struct, it's fairly easy to copy your c4 bot to clobber, just change the sim a bit
 MSmits: but it's a math game to some extent, like D&amp;B, not as much as D&amp;B, but more than the regular boardgame on CG
 MSmits: so after your mcts is done, there's no point going for max performance. anything you succesfully do with math is going to outdo any performance improvements
 struct: Hmm I guess Ill skip it then
 struct: :D
 MSmits: well as i said, it can be fun to just write a good sim. you'll be top 10 anyways
 MSmits: you can be top 10 in D&amp;B easily, without math also
 struct: Ill try it
 struct: But ill try to improve breakthrough for 1 more day or 2
 Marchete: for 50$, MSmits' sentences that doesn't contain "D&amp;B" in them
 Marchete: :D
 MSmits:  :)
 struct: I solve quite early on breakthrough
 struct: compared to some other bots
 MSmits: I think i am going to do something cheeky to try and beat mikla
 Counterbalance: clobber needs more than a good sim to be top 10
 MSmits: i mean sim + search
 Marchete: you are attracting ppl to D&amp;B...
 Marchete: don't lie
 Counterbalance: i've an mcts with extremely fast sim.. top 15
 MSmits: Counterbalance I worked on it for 1 day, it's still 8th. there's no math in it
 MSmits: struct is a master at performance, his C4 is faster than mine
 MSmits: so thats why i said he can do clobber top 10
 Counterbalance: i'm sure he can
 MSmits: hmm
 Marchete: I just need 30000 coeffs, ezpz
 MSmits: if your sim is extremely fast i am surprised it is only top 15 though Counterbalance. let me see if i use some trick i can share
 Counterbalance: I've got 1.5M sims, 27k-80k rollouts
 MSmits: okt let me check
 MSmits: what is a sim in your case?
 Counterbalance: performing 1 move for 1 player
 MSmits: oh ok
 Counterbalance: including finding legal moves
 struct: all legal moves?
 MSmits: i have to redefine then sec
 struct: or just 1?
 Counterbalance: something inbetween&#160;:)
 struct: I have no idea how many sims i have in c4/bt
 jacek: hm?
 Counterbalance: well, actually, all. But I don't  store them during rollout
 struct: I know that I have like 5M rollouts on first turn on bt
 struct: on c4 Its 3M+-
 MSmits: Counterbalance i have 4.1 million sims in your definition
 struct: if you are gonna play a random move you dont need to calculate all
 MSmits: i counted every time a move is applied
 MSmits: so during selection and during  random rollout
 Counterbalance: I don't apply moves during selection
 MSmits: ok sec
 MSmits: yeah that did not matter
 MSmits: 4.4 million now without selection
 MSmits: different cpu i guess
 MSmits: i do 1 selection and then rollout from each child
 MSmits: so selection is negligible
 MSmits: because... many children
 MSmits: this means i very few expansions also
 MSmits: i do
 MSmits: so most of calculation time is in the random rollout
 MSmits: and that is ridiculously fast so, that explains the high simcount
 Counterbalance: Mmm okay.. I've got &lt; 50% of time in rollout,&#160;; 33% in selection.
 MSmits: without testing i am pretty sure it's 90+% in random rollout for me
 MSmits: i do it 100 times or so in the first few turns, just for 1 expansion
 Counterbalance: aww dinner - bbl, curious to learn more!
 MSmits: this was just a first try that turned out ok. Could have failed miserably tbh
 MSmits: another time then, have a good dinner&#160;:)
 MSmits: so about D&amp;B. I have an idea Marchete
 MSmits: mikla still beats me by a little bit with nim
 MSmits: not as much as before, but still does
 MSmits: but he has no idea how to play out the endgame
 MSmits: properly anyways
 Marchete: well "no idea"&#160;!= "perfectly"
 MSmits: so what if i just make a ton of loops and other small object. In that case having control is not enough
 Marchete: or properly :D
 Marchete: I said that Smits
 MSmits: no i mean, compared to the rest of the top 10
 MSmits: everyone else does it better
 MSmits: top 20 even
 Marchete: trying to create hard to solve solutions for others
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: you did say that
 MSmits: I think mcts might be good here
 Marchete: with my graph too
 MSmits: random rollout with an eval of the objects at the end
 Marchete: I can "create" loops, giving some small bonus
 MSmits: yeah, but big loops are bad too
 MSmits: a 8 loop is neutral
 MSmits: and a 4 chain also
 MSmits: 4 loop is bad for the person in control
 MSmits: 6 loop too
 MSmits: and 3 chain
 MSmits: I wont need to do it with graph I think. I can just randomly fill the board safely and do a bunch of floodfills to count loops and chains at the end
 MSmits: i do floodfills for my score solver too, to build a graph, so i already have the floodfill, i just dont need the graph itself
 MSmits: will be cool to have something to use calculation time for in the beginning of the game

 OldJohn: @martinpapa69
 martinpapa69: sup OldJohn

 MSmits: hi OldJohn
 MSmits: and Marchete

 OldJohn: Hi MSmits
 martinpapa69: yo
 LibgdxKotlinChampion: someone make youtube videos of owning in clash of code
 Thyl: Sokoban finished
 MSmits: grats
 Counterbalance: back (thanks MSmits)
 MSmits: hey wb
 Counterbalance: so I guess your trick is to do more than 1 rollout at once?
 MSmits: it might be yeah
 MSmits: i often do this in boardgames
 MSmits: just roll out each child and backpropagate the combined results
 MSmits: I also have mcts solver, not sure if you're using that
 MSmits: seems standard for most players
 Counterbalance: Not sure what that is..
 MSmits: ah well that explains a lot
 MSmits: mcts solver solves the game
 MSmits: in addition to just gathering statistics
 BlaiseEbuth: What a surprise... The name is pretty cryptic...
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/571192118">https://www.codingame.com/replay/571192118</a>
 Counterbalance:&#160;:) I found this - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 MSmits: yeah thats where it comes from but the code is not great
 Counterbalance: ok i'll read it to get the idea.
 struct: The code made me not want to learn it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a8e4b556-78a6-41c2-bc0a-243c103f650c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a8e4b556-78a6-41c2-bc0a-243c103f650c</a>
 MSmits: selected is an array of selected nodes i also use for backpropagation
 MSmits: (I dont store parent or anything
 Astrobytes: I thought I understood before I read the code
 Astrobytes: Turned out I did lol
 MSmits: for clarification: status 2 = ongoing game, status 1 is win, status -1  is loss
 AntiSquid: how do you make random rollouts without making it too time consuming&#160;?
 MSmits: normally i also have 0 for draw
 struct: which game AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: like i get how to represent any board game through bit magic and use bit operations, but then going through the bits to find what's on and picking at random seems to drag me down
 struct: pdep
 AntiSquid: any board game really . square grids
 MSmits: basically Counterbalance, you expand your leaf and if you encounter a win or loss, you start propagating that up the tree. Every node will have a flag 
 MSmits: you never select solved nodes again
 MSmits: which is where the gain happens
 MSmits: especially in nim games like clobber
 struct: const uint64_t pdep = _pdep_u64((1ULL &lt;&lt; rand(__builtin_popcountll(moves_mask))), moves_mask);
 struct: that returns the mask of a random move
 struct: a random set bit
 MSmits: also AntiSquid, for selection of random moves, dont create a vector or something
 Astrobytes: I have _tzcnt_u64(_pdep_u64(1ULL &lt;&lt; rnd64.getRandomInt(_mm_popcnt_u64(mask))), mask));
 Astrobytes: same thing more or less
 AntiSquid: isn't the rollout itself also wasteful&#160;? is it worth having one instead of just scoring the node arbitrarily&#160;? 
 MSmits: this depends on how good you can score it
 MSmits: a random score is by definition going to be worse than a random rollout
 MSmits: but a sensible eval might be better
 MSmits: random rollouts work well for games that are hard to score
 MSmits: I use it for langtons ant, uttt, bandas, c4
 AntiSquid: and if i have the score from the game itself&#160;? say code a la mode&#160;?
 MSmits: oh and clobber i guess
 MSmits: code a la mode is a horrible example because it's cooperative, but i get your point
 MSmits: the game score can be part of eval
 MSmits: my oware score is part of my eval i
 MSmits: so is the number of seeds
 MSmits: how many in each hole 
 MSmits: etc
 MSmits: if you mean the game score at the end of the game, then thats different
 MSmits: from what i read in papers it's generally worse to backpropagate end of game score, than the actual win/loss result
 Counterbalance: msmits:  i always backprop the outcome, but, are you saying to mark all ancestor nodes as a 'terminal node' based on 1 rollout?
 MSmits: not all ancestor nodes
 struct: based on expansion
 MSmits: say you got to a leaf
 MSmits: on expansion you find the leaf is a win
 MSmits: then the parent automatically is a loss
 MSmits: if all siblings of that parent are losses, then the grandparent is a win
 MSmits: and so on
 MSmits: on a win you need only 1 child for the parent to become a loss
 MSmits: on a loss, all children need to be losses for the parent to be a win
 MSmits: thats the basics
 MSmits: so you backpropagate the normal statistics
 MSmits: but you *also* backpropagate terminal status
 MSmits: in a separate function
 MSmits: this is the solver
 MSmits: it terminates when it encounters a loss where the siblings have not been solved (they could still be wins)
 Counterbalance: okay, interesting. It does seem weird to me to mark a node as win/loss based on a single rollout of it's children though
 MSmits: no, not based on a rollout
 MSmits: on the actual end of the game
 Counterbalance: that's what I mean by rollout - it sims until end of game
 MSmits: when you expand, one or more of the expanded moves ends the game
 MSmits: i mean you dont even do a random rollout
 MSmits: because the game is over
 MSmits: thats when you solve
 Counterbalance: ohh okay, so when at least 1 child is a terminal node, say
 MSmits: if its a win, then 1 is enough
 MSmits: if it's a loss, then they all need to be losses
 Counterbalance: Yes indeed.. I did struggle with that - the select() kept finding those nodes
 Counterbalance: Cool thanks, that'll speed things up a lot, I think
 MSmits: yes, for some games it works better than others
 MSmits: i suspect it will work wonders for clobber
 MSmits: because nim games are all or nothing and you need to fully solve to be certain
 Counterbalance: it's also a great game for a fast sim - very elegant
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thats why i quickly wrote a bot, i could just copy from another game and easily put in the sim
 Counterbalance: yup.. valid moves calculation is just 4 shifts and 6 ands&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: clobber is the new kink eh
 MSmits: not mine
 MSmits: but I like it
 69razer69: i am just amazed i was solving the chuck nourris code golf using python and coudnt do better than 140 found ppl using python did it in 86 character
 AntiSquid: if it's a solo game what do you suggest backpropagating then MSmits&#160;?
 GregMc: I'm 0.09 points short of Wood 1 in Klobber :slight_frown:
 AntiSquid: there's no real win/loss there
 jacek: everyone is winner in single player game
 AntiSquid: yes
 GregMc: Idk, I've lost solitaire a few times
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: I used solo mcts for that coloured balls optim
 MSmits: i forgot the name
 jacek: the same
 MSmits: but i basically backpropagated end of game score, or max score
 MSmits: it wasnt that great
 AntiSquid: coloured balls optim ... need to figure out which one that is
 MSmits: but apparently it's what scientists tried in papers too, so i didnt do something stupid
 MSmits: same game
 AntiSquid: square balls&#160;? :P
 Astrobytes: balls aka squares
 MSmits: are they square?
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: i forgot the shape
 MSmits: it's not relevant :p
 Astrobytes: StC has balls
 NinjaDoggy: Hey MSmits, for MCTS solver how do you typically handle draws?
 MSmits: sec
 jacek: he cries then
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28dd0b46-ddbb-401e-9bd5-c723b8194575">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28dd0b46-ddbb-401e-9bd5-c723b8194575</a>
 Astrobytes: cries in bits
 NinjaDoggy: mainly the following case:
 MSmits: same as my previously shared code
 MSmits: only for draws
 AntiSquid: forgot stc has balls
 MSmits: -1 loss, 0 draw, 1 win, 2 = ongoing
 NinjaDoggy: but isn't it sometimes bad to ignore draw nodes?
 MSmits: there's ways to deal with that, but in my experience they make  performance worse
 NinjaDoggy: for example:let's say a node's true value is drawand it only has 1 child node that leads to a drawand the rest are losses
 NinjaDoggy: then the draw child node is quickly solved and ignored in further select()
 NinjaDoggy: and the node seems worse than it would be if MCTS solver wasn't implemented
 MSmits: in practice this never happens though, as draws are almost always harder to solve
 MSmits: but sometimes they solver sooner because they get more visits, sure
 MSmits: but they need A LOT more visits to solve
 MSmits: sometimes hundreds of times more
 NinjaDoggy: is that true?
 MSmits: so the statistics are skewed less than you think
 NinjaDoggy: can't you get a lot of game states where you can immediately end the game for a draw
 MSmits: yes because, on a win the parent is a loss
 NinjaDoggy: but if you choose other moves to play on, you'll eventually end up with a loss?
 MSmits: on a draw, the parent is only a draw when all nodes are drawn
 MSmits: i guess it dpeends on the game
 NinjaDoggy: yes so just thinking about the search tree that makes sense, but terminal nodes aren't all at the same depth right
 MSmits: if there are games where you can do this, it could become problematic
 MSmits: for some games terminal nodes are all at the same depth more or less
 MSmits: for some games they arent
 NinjaDoggy: I guess most games don't have this property though so you're right, in practice this doesn't really happen
 RoboStac: it matters quite a bit in nn based oware I think (it's the only one I do the proper thing)
 MSmits: yeah it might matter there. It doesn't in uttt for example
 MSmits: not in my experience
 MSmits: I tried selecting drawn nodes even when they were solved
 MSmits: wasnt better
 NinjaDoggy: wait so... what's the "proper" thing?
 MSmits: i guess the proper thing might be to select the possible loss, but backpropagate a draw anyway?
 RoboStac: don't choose draw nodes in selection but if a parent has a drawn child convert any losing back prop scores into drawn
 MSmits: this also biases
 NinjaDoggy: ok yea that does make sense thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: because a losing node may still backpropagate 20% wins
 MSmits: and if you turn 80% loss into draw and 20% win not into draw, the loss will seem winning
 MSmits: the draw i mean
 MSmits: the trick is to only start backpropagating wins, when the unfinished node value is higher than the draw value
 MSmits: otherwise only backpropagate draws
 RoboStac: but theres no possibility of it being a loss as there is a guarenteed draw
 MSmits: of course
 NinjaDoggy: but loss nodes might result in a win
 NinjaDoggy: so if you only correct the loss results
 NinjaDoggy: you get bias is the point i think
 MSmits: you get a net positive score
 MSmits: instead of 0
 MSmits: and it should be 0
 RoboStac: if there are nodes that are still winning it shouldn't be 0 though
 NinjaDoggy: well a node could be a dead loss
 NinjaDoggy: but some iterations lead to a win
 NinjaDoggy: like 10% win, 90% loss or something
 NinjaDoggy: if you only zero out the 90% loss, the losing node seems positive
 MSmits: at least during backpropagation
 RoboStac: yeah, I guess from the point of view of random rollouts it matters
 MSmits: i solved this by capping to the value of the lost node
 MSmits: the losing node
 MSmits: it cant propagate wins until it's average value is higher than the draw
 MSmits: so, never
 MSmits: and if it ever becomes better than the draw, well then its proper to backprop wins
 MSmits: in any case, the small hit from these checks made it worse for me
 MSmits: you can also do ab pruning for mcts solver btw
 MSmits: well something similar anyways
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/3f9dfPw">https://imgur.com/a/3f9dfPw</a>
 MSmits: this shows you mcts ab pruning with draws
 MSmits: you dont need to finish all nodes to know the top node is a draw
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 MSmits: just keep a flag on each node ("has child with draw"
 MSmits: then you can write a more complicated solver function that uses this
 MSmits: i did it before, it works, but very messy
 jacek: but is it worth it online?
 MSmits: pretty negligible in uttt
 MSmits: barely any benefit, definitely not worth the time debugging
 MSmits: i guess it could be good for games with lots of draws
 struct: wtb eval
 jacek: for what
 MSmits: bt
 MSmits: he's still obsessed
 NinjaDoggy: bt?
 Astrobytes: breakthrough
 jacek: i was obsessed with it for long time
 MSmits: yeah you actually had a really strong eval before you wrote a NN
 MSmits: i think it might have been the best, wasnt it?
 MSmits: before NN's existed
 jacek: top 3 was tied
 MSmits: ah
 jacek: and eval was: piece count, pst, penalty for attacked undefended piece if not my turn, bonus for horizontal connected on row 6
 jacek: mostly hand tuned
 struct: my eval is random stuff
 martinpapa69: why dont you train an nn to find the best coeffs for your eval
 struct: i dont know how&#160;:'(
 jacek: use texel method?
 struct: Im not even sure if this formation is good or not
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/MEyf5Zf.png">https://i.imgur.com/MEyf5Zf.png</a>
 jacek: oO
 GregMc: Ayyy I finally got top 500 in clash :sunglasses:
 struct: grats
 xxd: what is ut16
 xxd: trick
 jacek: hm?
 Marchete: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 xxd: some guy in his twitch stream description said he wont use the ut16 trick in private clashes
 jacek: utf16 trick
 jacek: yeah, who uses that :unamused:
 xxd: ah
 Husoski: I don't like it.  It's a cheat, since the actual source file size (assuming UTF-8 encoding) is larger than the unencoded version.
 Astrobytes: Since anything is allowed, it's not technically a cheat though.
 struct: jace k playing coc o.o
 Astrobytes: oO
 jacek: urmum
 jacek: why i cant invite cocbytes
 Oppaimaster: bebus
 GregMc: Utf16 isn't literal cheating, but it's definitely moral cheating
 struct: bt needs a boss so it can get potwk
 struct: potw*
 Marchete: moral?
 Marchete: lol
 struct: just play multis, dont think you can cheat there
 struct: "cheat"*
 jacek: but bt was potw already
 struct: oh really
 Marchete: yeah, there you can use UTF16 to send garbage character :D
 Marchete: can't
 jacek: it was before the quest ma[
 jacek: map
 struct: ah
 struct: What rank was your non NN bot on breakthrough?
 struct: +-
 jacek: top 3
 jacek: rps between top3 actually
 struct: MCTS or minimax?
 jacek: minimax
 Husoski: GregMc Agreed...but if the scoring system measured actual code size rather than codepoint count in the editor, that would make the annoyance go away.  The point of CoC is for people to try out ideas and learn new things.  You don't learn squat from a pseudorandom garbage string.
 Marchete: you learned a new layer of making code shorter
 Husoski: Longer
 Husoski: Each of those "two character" codes takes at least 3 bytes in UTF8
 Marchete: python3 has this functionality by default? if yes, then it's correct to use any python3 utility available to win
 Husoski: Yes, and it's only a win because the scoring doesn't count code size correctly.  IMHO, of course.
 Marchete: indeed
 Marchete: but as it counts chars
 Marchete: it's the best tool to win
 GregMc: You may win by doing it, but no one will like you for it :joy:
 Astrobytes: It's correct for here though. Plenty other places to golf in bytes.
 jacek: but that allows NN geeks to encode almost 2x more weights
 Counterbalance: does it only work for utf16 or also for utf8?
 jacek: utf8 is 1 char/1 bytes already no?
 RoboStac: it's java's string length so uses utf16
 GregMc: You encode it to utf16 then use a decode and an eval to run it
 Counterbalance: no, 5 bytes per char possible
 Marchete: that damn guy is a cheater
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZsH46Ek2ao">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZsH46Ek2ao</a>
 Marchete: how dare to do that!? that's cheating
 RoboStac: teaching people that length of string&#160;!= size of string in bytes is probably the most educational thing to come out of coc
 Astrobytes: Perhaps the only thing? :D
 jacek: reminds me of that RL walking robot (spider?) that found bizarre way of walking
 jacek: as long as it works...
 GregMc: Yep, and it's a neat learning tool. That's why I called it moral cheating; you know when you're using it just to win instead of to learn 
 Marchete: use that too
 Marchete: you have the tool
 Astrobytes: I think you'll learn more doing something other than clashes tbh, they're just supposed to be 'fun'
 Marchete: in multiplayer games I saw that NN guys were cheating
 Marchete: so I forced me to learn
 Marchete: they still beat me but I wasted 1 year doing it :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Just my opinion ofc :innocent:
 Astrobytes: lol
 GregMc: Yep, clashes are just what I do in my spare time at work
 MSmits: I had students this year that were cyberslacking (= playing on computer during school) by playing clashes
 MSmits: I was sort of ok with it
 Astrobytes: Yeah exactly. More learning value in puzzles or the multiplayers (depending what you like) imo
 MSmits: at least they were practicin coding a bit
 Astrobytes: hahaha that's amusing
 Astrobytes: "But Mr Smits - you play on that site too" 
 GregMc: Clashes are nice bc I don't have the time to actually sit and focus on making a decent bot. Tried to do Clobber today, ended up half paying attention, getting mad, and dumping in 200 if statements with a sprinkle of Math.random 
 Husoski: That's where most of the good coders came from when I was in school.  Hangers around the data center (yep, that's how old I am) doing stuff that wasn't assigned.
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah, they knew
 Astrobytes: GregMc: yeah totally understand, it does take some investment time-wise for the bot stuff, puzzles not so much
 Astrobytes: Also, those board games aren't easy to write a really quick bot for (usually)
 MSmits: GregMc it helps if you have a basic bot to start from. If you make one basic mcts bot for some game, you can easily adapt it (takes 2-4 hrs) to different games
 struct: step 1 make mcts for normal TTT
 MSmits: the search algorithm is the same, only the simulation is different
 struct: step 2 copy paste
 GregMc: What's mcts?
 struct: monte carlo tree search
 MSmits: monte carlo tree search
 MSmits: match!
 Astrobytes: Convergence.
 jacek: slow poke
 GregMc: Ah, gotcha. I should probably learn how to do that
 MSmits: for some people minimax is easier
 PatrickMcGinnisII: puzzle done, back to work
 struct: connect 4 should be one of the easier to start with
 MSmits: also can be plugged in to many games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 Astrobytes: get to grips with minimax first I think
 Astrobytes: It helps later on
 MSmits: minimax is simpler and gives you a better understanding of game trees i think
 MSmits: you avoid the statistics stuff
 MSmits: easier to debug too
 GregMc: I mean, I did great at statistics in college. Data structures was the class I failed :joy:
 MSmits: is a bitboard a data structure?
 Wontonimo: hey, if you are good at stats and not a fan of trees, do i have the bot for you!  FlatMC&#160;!
 MSmits: oh yeah, do his flat mc thing
 MSmits: great place to start also
 Astrobytes: WontonimoBot right on time :D
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ultimate-tic-tac-toe-puzzle-discussion/22616/114">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ultimate-tic-tac-toe-puzzle-discussion/22616/114</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure.
 MSmits: Marchete, I think this guy is doing what i want to do: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/571215989">https://www.codingame.com/replay/571215989</a>
 Wontonimo: This is FlatMC as applied to Tic Tac Toe.
 MSmits: i often see games like this vs him
 GregMc: I googled "flat monte carlo", and I gotta say, those are some nice 1 bedroom apartments
 Counterbalance: MSmits that 4M simcount was in &lt; 100ms right?
 Wontonimo: it is also called Plain MC, MC, and LazyMammal has called it 1plyMC
 Astrobytes: lol, it's a random search.
 MSmits: yeah, i got 40+ million on turn 1
 Counterbalance: only 22M here
 Astrobytes: You can go as deep as you like but often not worth going overly deep
 MSmits: might be my sim is faster, let me check
 MSmits: I'll pm you something
 Counterbalance: I added that solver thingy but it makes no difference
 MSmits: it fully works?
 MSmits: you can check vs my bot
 MSmits: they should agree
 struct: Which game are you playing counter?
 struct: I forgot
 Astrobytes: Clobber
 struct: ah right
 struct: I need to rest, breakthrough has been killing me
 Counterbalance: i'll need to get back to D&amp;B, dropped 35 ranks
 MSmits: if you do, try the math. It's everything in D&amp;B
 MSmits: it's pretty different from other games
 MSmits: also still no NN there
 Marchete: indeed, nim game
 MSmits: not that you can't use them at all, but if you do, it will be NN + math, not just NN and so long as someone isn't willing to get into the math, then the NN is pointless
 Marchete: I'm not sure
 Marchete: as I said
 Marchete: I can feed a NN with my graphs
 Marchete: maybe it works
 MSmits: it needs to play perfectly for 70 moves
 MSmits: NN's dont generally play perfectly
 MSmits: the math does
 Marchete: what 70 moves
 Marchete: on solved?
 MSmits: I mean plies
 MSmits: my nim solver works from frame 40 or so sometimes, sometimes 45
 MSmits: game has 112 plies
 MSmits: so if you're going completely mathless, it has to be able to do that too
 Marchete: at 57 is classic nim, no?
 MSmits: in other games, 1 or 2 mistakes is fine. Here 1 mistake = loss
 MSmits: 57 is the endgame
 MSmits: nim solver solves way before the end game
 MSmits: i can score solve around 50 probably
 MSmits: but nim solver 40-45
 MSmits: mikla can do usually 1 or 2 plies before me&#160;:(
 MSmits: not always though, i beat him to it sometimes, but that doesnt mean i win
 Marchete: at turn 40?
 Marchete: so 17 turns ahead
 Marchete: it's a lot
 MSmits: yeah it is
 MSmits: because of divide and conquer
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571216630">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571216630</a>  this is typical
 MSmits: he says win and my bot cries on the next frame
 MSmits: then we both nim-solved
 AllYourTrees: what is a nim solver?
 MSmits: do you know nim?
 AllYourTrees: the programming language?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim</a>
 MSmits: it's a game where the last player to pick up an item from a stack, loses (or wins depending on rules)
 MSmits: in D&amp;B the last player to make a safe move usually wins
 MSmits: then the next player has to open a chain
 MSmits: and the other player can keep control and capture most of the boxes
 MSmits: the nim solver just calculates which player is last to open a safe move, basically
 MSmits: it doesnt care about score
 MSmits: and you can use divide and conquer to solve isolated areas separately
 AllYourTrees: huh interesting
 MSmits: yeah its a whole area of research
 MSmits: combinatorial game theory
 Astrobytes: ^
 AllYourTrees: :scream: ty for info!
 MSmits: np&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: so what you're saying is we need to use the GNN + AZ approach that derjack linked earlier to apply AZ to smaller parts of the game?
 MSmits: no, i was saying that you can use a NN early on in the game, when nim solving is not possible
 MSmits: there's all sorts of ways serious players count chains to predict what the nim score will be
 MSmits: a NN can sort of do this
 MSmits: it wont be exact, but may boost win probability
 AllYourTrees: ah so there's like multiple phases of the game? first part is normal, last part is resolving the chains?
 MSmits: i would say 3 phases
 jacek: GNN eh
 MSmits: opening phase where almost noone knows what to do
 MSmits: then nim solve phase (after 35 it's possible, usually 40)
 MSmits: then after 50 or so you can score solve
 MSmits: and then it's just finishing up till frame 112
 AllYourTrees: interesting game
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's the most well known game on CG outside of CG I think
 MSmits: except maybe Go
 MSmits: and checkers
 AllYourTrees: you mean people don't know about the game "Spring Challenge 2021"?
 AllYourTrees:&#160;:)
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: even my wife knows how to play it
 MSmits: D&amp;B i mean
 MSmits: and she would not know any of the other games
 struct: not even yavalath?
 AllYourTrees: ya thats awesome
 MSmits: nope 
 MSmits: nor checkers
 MSmits: apparently if you play 3x3 boxes D&amp;B the game is easier to play perfectly than TTT
 MSmits: but people generally dont know the solution
 jacek: then we need ultimate d&amp;b
 MSmits: well we have 7x7, it's pretty ultimate&#160;:)
 MSmits: it scales very hard with increasing size
 jacek: and i dont know if many people know the rules of 'standard' checkers
 MSmits: well i learned a similar game when i was young. 10x10 checkers but with slightly different rules
 MSmits: the kings could move any distance
 MSmits: and you could jump backwards even for non-kings
 jacek: thats international draughts
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well thats what i learned then :p
 jacek: but at school kids often played version without mandatory jumps :s
 MSmits: oh ok we did use mandatory jumps
 jacek: is chess known outside of CG? :thinking:
 MSmits: 960 isnt 
 struct: we need ultimate hex

 Wontonimo: UTTT meets hex lol
 MSmits: as long as it's balanced with steal this time. C4 proves how necessary that is
 MSmits: or some other method, but probably steal
 MSmits: well yavalath proved it first. I mean that game is completely pointless without steal
 jacek: but does it have memes like c4?
 MSmits: haha no
 MSmits: i love those
 MSmits: link the page again, maybe someone hasnt seen it
 jacek: its in the forums
 MSmits: oh ok

 Astrobytes: I was thinking of porting Trevor Is Dead
 Astrobytes: (in the link)
 MSmits: how does that work?
 Astrobytes: no clue
 Astrobytes: (it was a joke btw)
 MSmits: ah ok, it just wooshed me is all
 MSmits: as they sometimes do
 Astrobytes: Just sometimes eh
 MSmits: sometimes has a wide range
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 kresteodymium: hi Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hello
 Wontonimo: last uttt - 30th @24.65 ... shooting for higher
 Wontonimo: up to 28th @25.31
 pcc_programmeur: hello 
 LibgdxKotlinChampion: welcome
 Wontonimo: hey new ppl
 Wontonimo: i had nachos tonight
 Wontonimo: like tacos, but open face and closer to chaos
 BlaiseEbuth: :taco:
 Wontonimo: Submitting version of UTTT without board in the node.  Node size is now 24
 Wontonimo: Thanks BlaiseEbuth!  I appreciate it.  Here is one in return :taco:
 BlaiseEbuth: :hugging:
 Wontonimo: oh, this bot shot up in the ranks pretty fast
 Wontonimo: and then stalled.  bad bot!
 N0T-Harold: YOOOO
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?

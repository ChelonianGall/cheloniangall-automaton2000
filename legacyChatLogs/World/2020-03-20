 nishantsinha: hi there
 nishantsinha: code on
 Philbot: hi here
 MadKnight: hi where
 phiyenv: hi
 Platiniom64: guys am I the only one that has some ieses with the vieing of games? sometimes after coding, the screen goes black
 Platiniom64: and the only option is to releaod the page
 Platiniom64: do you guys know what a solution could be?
 darkhorse64: Mischief achieved. I beat eulerscheZahl at its own game 
 darkhorse64: *his* 
 faisalwani: hi
 Uljahn: Platiniom64: the solution is to update your browser and download more ram
 SeebOmega: j25huang You re welcome for the push in GoD :P
 eulerscheZahl: return of the contest :o<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/crystal-rush">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/crystal-rush</a>
 eulerscheZahl: damn darkhorse64, uncool
 darkhorse64: MSmits is also preparing a bot. The leaderboard is going to smoke
 eulerscheZahl: no, smits will get distracted very soon
 eulerscheZahl: won't beat me this month
 struct: why do you say that?
 eulerscheZahl: my left knee itches
 Illedan: :D
 struct: I see :thinking:
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: you found it before [CG]Thibaud announced it on #fr
 dbdr: monitoring the HTML?&#160;;)
 [CG]Thibaud: I announced it on Discord before
 [CG]Thibaud: :grin:
 dbdr: I preferred my version&#160;;)
 [CG]Thibaud: discussion about the challenge and the release report was live there
 [CG]Thibaud: hehe
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: hitting Ctrl-R every 5 minutes for 6 months :D
 Illedan: Nah, he has a script checking every 10 ms
 dbdr: true, eulerscheZahl automates
 struct: Is it me or the letters colors dont really look good?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/18F4Ng1.png">https://i.imgur.com/18F4Ng1.png</a>
 dbdr: a bit hard to read, but does not shock me
 [CG]Thibaud: let's go: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>
 Illedan: :rocket:
 Astrobytes: lol wot
 struct: nice nice
 struct: :D
 struct: 1 month damn
 struct: If I dont get legend I delete
 eulerscheZahl: bye
 Illedan: Not again
 Astrobytes: shush struct :D
 struct: wait let me see the game first
 struct: :p
 eulerscheZahl: you have 2.5h to make guesses about the game
 dbdr: marathon!
 eulerscheZahl: a sports game?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: Illedan, you kept a good secret
 dbdr: or I missed it :D
 Illedan: We started 2 days ago :P
 dbdr: wow
 eulerscheZahl: CG had a prototype
 Astrobytes: Good job guys
 dbdr: and made a game that has depth for a month?
 Astrobytes: "depth" heh heh
 eulerscheZahl: had to update to new SDK version and add some parts, but a huge part was finished
 dbdr: ah ok
 dbdr: anyways, it's cool, thanks for doing it!
 eulerscheZahl: complains about missing infos in the statement go to me
 eulerscheZahl: so i can forward to :trash: :D
 eulerscheZahl: :trashbin:
 struct: :smiling_imp:
 dbdr: complaint: I can't see the statement
 eulerscheZahl: for the FR version we just replaced all "the" by "le" and added an "e" to the end of some words
 struct: lol
 wlesavo: wow
 darkhorse64: You should have asked me for translation :innocent:
 wlesavo: gonna be my first contest
 struct: maybe put link on discord [CG]Thibaud?
 wlesavo: its on a front page
 struct: ok I  see he is typing on annoucements
 struct: channel created
 [CG]Thibaud: incoming
 struct: :thumbsup:
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: CGPlagueInc?
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, i forgot
 eulerscheZahl: luckily my bad memory allows me to participate as a regular contestant
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: if you started 2 days ago and it lasts a month, fair enough
 dbdr: just stop submitting 2 days before the end&#160;;)
 Illedan: haha
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have a bot yet (this part is true)
 dbdr: which part isn't true?
 eulerscheZahl: that i forgot the game
 dbdr: " Are there any prizes to win? In the current situation, we're unable to ensure the delivery of prizes to winners. "
 dbdr: masks with the CG logo would be a cool collector item
 eulerscheZahl: even RAIC prize shipping got delayed
 eulerscheZahl: they sent a mail that they will start shiiping in 2 weeks or so
 eulerscheZahl: and shortly after: delayed
 dbdr: [CG]Thibaud said on #fr that this was decided because of the containment situation, that is really nice!
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know much of the backgroundonly that CG wanted a contest really soon
 eulerscheZahl: and that illedan got crazy to make it happen
 wlesavo: finished bnc just in time :slight_smile:
 Illedan: :angel:
 wlesavo: btw have this brilliant strategy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440851995">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440851995</a>
 Illedan: Can't see that replay
 blasterpoard: change share-replay to replay in the link
 struct: oh they really changed
 struct: it use to change alone
 struct: if you were not the owner
 G-Rom: bug
 dbdr: I can see it
 eulerscheZahl: toad strategy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440852767">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440852767</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i could watch that replay too
 struct: Yeah I can watch
 struct: but had to remove share-
 dbdr: wlesavo yay, you got 100%!&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: my first 100% had a score above 2000 :D
 dbdr: wow
 eulerscheZahl: and the solver for 1..7 digits is almost unchanged
 wlesavo: yeah, implemented that swap 2 digits/check greedy algo
 eulerscheZahl: so you can imagine my efficiency for larger numbers
 wlesavo: took me like 10 min
 dbdr: strange that it works well now
 dbdr: only change was efficiency?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, mostly
 eulerscheZahl: and better number selection, but that's like 320-&gt;304
 eulerscheZahl: my best offline run was 290, average around 314-316
 wlesavo: also finished both vox codeis, wanted to do that for quite some time, so now im up and ready for contest
 dbdr: I had a 27x, from memory
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl in offlines do you generate secret randomly?
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile it was announced today that we have to stay at home in Bavaria (part of Germany where I live) as well
 eulerscheZahl: yes, random secret fixed at turn 1
 dbdr: with a change that seems better locally but worse online
 eulerscheZahl: i know it's different to your game
 wlesavo: that could be an issue
 dbdr: so probably the fixed responses matter
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: perfect timing
 wlesavo: i guess i can make number of b/c in validators public
 eulerscheZahl: but 1 month? i hope i can go outside before
 dbdr: I saw doubling of deaths in 1 day in germany, crazy if that continues. so sounds  like a good idea
 eulerscheZahl: at some point we are all dead, then it has to stop :D
 dbdr: in france you can go outside for exercise, alone, just don't get close to other people
 dbdr: exact
 eulerscheZahl: right, here too
 eulerscheZahl: you can go for a walk alone or with your family
 struct: Is it everywhere in france like that?
 dbdr: yes
 struct: I saw in news that you must write a paper to go outside in france
 dbdr: right
 struct:  its true?
 JBM: yes
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr do you live in france or hungary?
 dbdr: hungary
 dbdr: but family in france, so I follow
 JBM: how's it going in hungary then?
 eulerscheZahl: ah. did you live there before? you seem fluent in that language
 dbdr: I'm not fluent, intermediary level. I live there for a long time but use more english
 JBM: you read fluent
 dbdr: 75 cases, 1 death in HU
 dbdr: all of western and northern europe has much more than the east
 darkhorse64: dbdr is kidding. He speaks French so well that I believed the Hungarian flag was a fake
 dbdr: not fluent *in hungarian*&#160;:)
 struct: I just cant understand how china numbers stopped growing so fast
 dbdr: french is my mother tongue, I hope I read fluent :D
 JBM: ok it's your english that's unclear :p
 dbdr: thanks :D
 dbdr: struct: very strict measures
 dbdr: it worked amazingly indeed
 darkhorse64: Chinese stats are driven by politics
 JBM: all stats are
 dbdr: there were international inspectors there. it's not all fake
 dbdr: WHO
 dbdr: of course it's also politics, as everywhere
 struct: I also see that japan still wanna host Olympics
 JBM: it's in quite some time
 JBM: they can just quarantine everyone
 darkhorse64: Local testimonies seem to imply it was worse than publicly reported. That may explain why Italy is so severely struck
 dbdr: Illedan, eulerscheZahl: do you know if the game is what was planned for May?
 dbdr: answer: no
 JBM: where did you read that answer?
 JBM: oh got it
 Tiramon: uuuuh ... new contest
 dbdr: #fr. in case you read french well enough&#160;;)
 JBM: still working on it
 Tiramon: dbdr google translate does read it for me&#160;;)
 dbdr: Tiramon: you can even use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Fr%2F&amp;namespace=3000">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Fr%2F&amp;namespace=3000</a> to avoid copy-pasting
 dbdr: only works for past days though
 dbdr: not live yet&#160;:)
 Tiramon: chrome has a translation of websites included dbdr ... no need to copy paste
 dbdr: I know
 dbdr: but how else do you see the Fr chat on a webpage? ah, it works in the webchat too?
 Tiramon: yes it does
 dbdr: strange, does not work for me on #ru
 dbdr: while it works on other pages
 struct: good gold on utg
 struct: insta promotion
 struct: seems like timers are equal to before
 struct: you get insta promotion no waiting
 struct: is this intended [CG]Thibaud?
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: awesome
 eulerscheZahl: damn, cat just puked&#160;:/
 [CG]Thibaud: hum not really struct
 struct: i got promoted from wood with no waiting time
 struct: to bronze
 struct: ´to silver
 struct: and now to gold
 [CG]Thibaud: you didn't participate in the contest&#160;?
 dbdr: wat?
 Scarfield: Ocean of Code? When was this made public, didnt notice it yesterday
 struct: yes but not on this account
 struct: on my deleted account I did
 dbdr: either he did and he should not start in wood, or he didn't and how could he write a gold bot this fast?
 SmellyPickle: just announced it on discord like 2 minutes ago
 psyral: I think it's new. I just saw it posted on the Discord channel a few minutes ago
 dbdr: ^ explained :D
 Scarfield: ah okay, wondered if i had somehow missed it for weeks or something&#160;:)
 Astrolopitheque: lets program
 struct: not now
 struct: in 1:45 hours yes
 Scarfield: An early thank you for the creators of Ocean of Code&#160;:) There will hopefully be many hours of fun for all of us&#160;:)
 dbdr: indeed. and 0 bugs so far&#160;;)
 psyral: This is a 1 MONTH contest!
 dbdr: yes, a 1 month contest that lasts 10 days :D
 Illedan: :D
 psyral: 10 days? it says March 20 to April 20
 dbdr: yes, it also says "The contest is open for 10 consecutive days. "
 dbdr: but I think the dates are the correct info
 JBM: typical
 Illedan: 1 month are correct
 dbdr: it's the trilogy in 7 volumes all over again
 dbdr: maybe CG knows something and many dates will be cancelled because of the pandemic
 JBM: let's ban may
 JBM: we've got the best months in the world, lemme telle you that
 JBM: top notch months. the chinese months pale in regard
 dbdr: many people say so
 JBM: the very best months. let's use only those
 MadKnight: let's ban months
 struct: let's ban time
 MadKnight: and space
 dbdr: "The Julian reform &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar</a>&gt; made 46 BC 445 days long"

 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth is going on ocean?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh?
 Illedan: Contest starting today&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: out of left field, i did not know
 Illedan: Was just announced
 PatrickMcGinnisII: moved to 1pm EST?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess i logged in at the right time
 Illedan: It lasts for 1 month&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so, by Illedan ....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
 Illedan: hmm what? :P
 struct: hmm, contest is ocean
 struct: your pic is in ocean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i couldn't think of anything smartass to say
 struct: toad belong in ocean
 psyral: If you refresh the page. It now says "The contest is open for 1 entire month."
 struct: rom has ocean pic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so give us the dope on OOC Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: i can give you OOP
 dbdr: Ocean Of Poop?
 Whatelse: do what you want cause a pirate is free, YOU ARE A PIRATE
 Philbot: OOF
 Philbot: C is silent
 IanCognito: The sea is silent? But I heard you can hear it inside a Shell? 
 Philbot: 3 sea shells&#160;?
 IanCognito: Yeah C Shell
 JBM: oh my, i've used csh before and never noticed the pun
 dbdr: in the ocean, nobody can hear you code
 dbdr: I haven't either :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: we shall release baby yoda on eulerscheZahl for his OOP jokes
 IanCognito: I object to OOP
 wlesavo: the question is can you hardcode the water or not
 eulerscheZahl: wouldn't it be ice then?
 wlesavo: i guess there is some ice in the water
 BenjaminUrquhart: I can finally fix my radar bug
 PatrickMcGinnisII: IanCognito that would make you classless
 IanCognito: lol
 Philbot: why is it a full month?
 IanCognito: Nope I'm just an anonymous type
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl you are your own shrine
 IanCognito: hence my name
 BenjaminUrquhart: Philbot just roll with it
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-bugs/167531">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-bugs/167531</a>bugs thread already open, that gives room for optimism :D
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl btw, how does one makes multi into a contest?  
 eulerscheZahl: only CG staff can do that
 Philbot: not reporting bugs, benj told me to just roll with it
 wlesavo: i mean how it is decided
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I am me, anyone can come knock on my door if they got problems... I'll show them my Soylent Green cookbook.&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud wanted a game, that's how it started
 BenjaminUrquhart: "The referee code is publicly available on Github"- repo is private
 eulerscheZahl: will be public when the contest starts
 struct: contest hasnt started
 BenjaminUrquhart: fair
 wlesavo: oh i see, so basically he came up to you directly?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: referee code 404, awe dman
 Philbot: any replays leaking&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: asked if i have a game ready - but that was my TD game which i've already released (not sure if it would make a good contest anyways)
 Illedan: TD would be fun for a weekend
 eulerscheZahl: i think the current game is a better candidate for a contest than TD would have been
 Illedan: Yeah, this has more depth to it than I thought. 
 Illedan: So much to look into and play with
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Should i pull out the dusty java books or am i ok to be mediocre with php eulerscheZahl?
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 BenjaminUrquhart: sPoIlErS
 Philbot: not all bugs fixed TM
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your approach PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sandbox is for cats
 eulerscheZahl: it's not as CPU heavy as UTTT
 Illedan: Depends what you want to do
 PatrickMcGinnisII: which i didn't finish lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 days ago i rewired half my house, yesterday i setup a 3d printer and a cnc machine to go with my laser... so now instead of playing with them, I guess I'll torture you all
 Philbot: you can 3D print anything!!!
 Philbot: print the internet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well people here are printing some kinda venturi tube for ventilators for infected people...weird, but DIY to the rescue
 Philbot: a community puzzle, a new multi and a contest, what a time to be alive
 sayuri: hey everyone. who did the approx(double[][] pts) Pi Approximation excercice in java&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: which community puzzle?
 Itayayay: Anyone else getting Internal Server error when trying to register?
 sayuri: it's a Java test
 TorgardTheAwkwardPoet: Yes, also getting the internal error.
 Illedan: They are looking into it
 BenjaminUrquhart: sayuri link?
 [CG]Thibaud: you can register again Itayayay
 Hjax: wait theres a new contest starting TODAY? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: so, contest or UTG?
 Hjax: what a pleasant surprise 
 Hjax: i only need a few hours to implement my wanted changes to my UTG bot 
 Hjax: its mostly just smarter radar placement and id abuse (unless they fixed it?)
 eulerscheZahl: 1 month for the new contest, no need to hurry
 Hjax: can the developers of the contest compete in it? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 Hjax: this contest is going to be super difficult, everyone is home with infinite time 
 eulerscheZahl: we only have an advantage of 2 days
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have a bot yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: they usually aren't eligible for prizes though
 Illedan: We can win it though
 struct: as you should
 struct: 2 days advantage is nothing
 Hjax: are there prizes for community contests? 
 struct: and even if it was more
 struct: I think its still fair
 Illedan: This one only has Fame and glory and CP. Which is more valuable :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: Are there any prizes to win?In the current situation, we're unable to ensure the delivery of prizes to winners.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if the contest is any good they should get developer plaques or something... I can make them for nuthin
 Hjax: since UTG was the first contest i took seriously, i have a lot of CP to gain by doing well here 
 [CG]Thibaud: we'll find something
 eulerscheZahl: UTG had expensive prizes (3000€ for the winner)
 Illedan: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: before it was 20 tshirts + artwork for top3
 BenjaminUrquhart: gosh dang it 10 minutes until the contest starts and I found out why CodinBot-Relay has broken avatars
 BenjaminUrquhart: &gt;.&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: a 30x40cm wall painting
 BenjaminUrquhart: aaaaaa
 Hjax: my goal in utg was to get a t-shirt, which i did, i guess my goal in ocean of code will be to place higher than i did in UTG 
 struct: my goal is not to delete account
 Hjax: i believe in you struct 
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah the account is going bye
 BenjaminUrquhart: sorry
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't believe
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't judge me like that
 Hjax: is reCurse playing in this one
 BenjaminUrquhart: ask him
 eulerscheZahl: i guess it depends on the game and if he likes it
 Hjax: i was kind of sad he didnt play UTG
 Hjax: even though him playing would have almost certainly cost me 1 rank 
 eulerscheZahl: you know him from halite, right?
 programjames: Have you done Battlecode before?
 Hjax: i have done battlecode 
 Hjax: made finals one year, placed 9th-12th
 Hjax: team name: When I'm GM
 tobk: hm, no XP for Crystal Rush instant League promotions? just asking...
 struct: no
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 programjames: Cool. Do you like Battlecode or these competitions more?
 Hjax: about the same programjames
 Hjax: i didnt use this site for a long time because i didnt like the UI 
 Hjax: which was kind of a stupid reason, and now i regret all of the contests i missed 
 eulerscheZahl: but CG improved a lot
 programjames: I haven't really done many competitions here... I don't like the UI&#160;:)
 programjames: (As much)
 Hjax: i knew of recurse from halite yeah, i only really played halite 3 for the first week though 
 BenjaminUrquhart: "{"id":-3,"message":"Service not found: search.search(2)"}"
 Hjax: peaked at rank 14 or so? then got bored of the game 
 BenjaminUrquhart: time to find search endpoint again
 Hjax: @programjames youll get over it fast
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh there's a third param now
 BenjaminUrquhart: eeee
 Hjax: whatcha doin ben
 BenjaminUrquhart: fixing the codingame discord bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have 2 minutes to do it 
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: new clash of code, fix the discord bot 
 dbdr: go go go BenjaminUrquhart
 GOLD.D.ROGER: what we have to do in tthis competition
 Nixerrr: No sleep till legend
 Hjax: rules in 2 minutes 
 dbdr: first logged contest&#160;:)
 Beast_99: :grinning:
 Hjax: @GOLD.D.ROGER
 GOLD.D.ROGER: k
 dbdr: Nixerrr arf :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: I BROKE THE WEBHOOKS AAA
 eulerscheZahl: *wood rules in 2min
 Nixerrr: :smile_cat:
 Hjax: oh does this game have multiple rulesets 
 eulerscheZahl: 1 new league each week
 Illedan: lol
 Hjax: UTG didnt, so i kind of assumed they had given up on it 
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: inb4, each league is an entirely different game :D
 GOLD.D.ROGER: did anyone participate before
 eulerscheZahl: have fun staying awake till legend Nixerrr
 Illedan: There are 3 sets of rules
 Nixerrr: I've got a lot of coffee :D
 blasterpoard: how many wood leagues?
 Illedan: 2
 eulerscheZahl: 2 wood, 1 bronze
 Hjax: one rule set per week? pretty slow 
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: You get all today
 Illedan: if you rank to Bronze, that is
 eulerscheZahl: full rules on day 1 after promotion
 GOLD.D.ROGER: here we go
 Hjax: ah ok cool 
 Sheepolution: Gooo
 dbdr: glhf
 eulerscheZahl: then silver opens next week, then gold, ...
 eulerscheZahl: start
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeet
 Nixerrr: gogogogo
 dbdr: cotc with square grid :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice boss<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440872355">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440872355</a>
 Waffle3z: lol I beat the boss without writing any code
 Hjax: lol the game is about submarines? now im honorbound to win it 
 Hjax: i work for electric boat, which makes submarines 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I love how everyone instantly submitted the template
 dbdr: looks twisted, IIUC
 BenjaminUrquhart: The following table shows, how different actions will be shown to your opponent:TODO: along with screenshot, as this table uses concrete examples and isn't abstract? 
 Hjax: this game looks super fun 
 dbdr: TODO :D
 Hjax: grid based, imperfect information, my favorite 
 Illedan: Lol dbdr. Yeah :o
 blasterpoard: A torpedo requires 3 charge actions to be ready. = cooldown of 3 turns?
 Hjax: when you move you pick an ability to charge blasterpoard
 Illedan: You have to charge it blasterpoard
 Hjax: so you need to charge torpedo 3 times 
 Hjax: before you can shoot 
 blasterpoard: thx
 Illedan: By using MOVE dir TORPEDO
 blasterpoard: reading too fast
 Illedan: the last one is what power to charge
 Illedan: you get 4 powers in total later
 PJA: captain sonar?
 Illedan: ye
 Hjax: this game is super cool, i love it already 
 PJA: such a good board game
 BenjaminUrquhart: LMAO I got promoted by doing nothing
 Hjax: the abilitys are torpedo, sonar, silence, and mine btw 
 Waffle3z: same
 Nixerrr: BenjaminUrquhart Same
 Hjax: judging by the screenshot 
 Hjax: the explanation of shooting a torpedo is unclear
 MSmits: holy sht... did a contest just start out of the blue (pun intended)
 Hjax: does it detonate instantly? whats this stuff about a path?
 BenjaminUrquhart: MSmits yes
 Illedan: Yes MSmits
 Hjax: basically smits, i learned about it 20 minutes ago 
 Illedan: Instantly
 Illedan: Hjax
 Hjax: welcome to the party 
 MSmits: thanks, you too
 Hjax: ok whats the path thing mean then 
 blasterpoard: is the torpedo range is not manhattan distance, I think
 Illedan: BFS
 Illedan: Around islands (not across)
 Hjax: so i can shoot anywhere within 4 manhattan distance? 
 blasterpoard: no
 Hjax: not counting islands*
 Marchete: hello people!
 Illedan: Hi
 blasterpoard: anywhere you can reach in 4 turns
 Illedan: Correct
 Hjax: yeah thats what i meant, i worded it poorly 
 MSmits: Marchete there is a contest and you have a month
 Hjax: ok i see 
 Illedan: Marchete might join :o
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: yeah I've just received an email
 MSmits: I told them, don't forget Marchete
 Marchete: :rofl:
 Marchete: you know I barely play challenges
 MSmits: yes, but this is a month long one
 Illedan: 1 month is enough right?
 MSmits: no excuses!
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: good way to get some cp
 blasterpoard: 1 month of this... another metagame hell
 Marchete: maybe the mood
 MSmits: blasterpoard, my advice, get a sim going, set up a bunch of different bot types, take a 2 week break, then enter the meta
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits fix your onitama :D
 MSmits: yeah... that's gonna have to wait, i was almost done too :P
 Hjax: MSmits you didnt play UTG right? 
 blasterpoard: MSmits my advice - get to the top early, make the meta, then test against your own bot when other sopy it
 blasterpoard: *copy
 MSmits: Hjax, no, i lost motivation after a few days
 Illedan: Nice strat
 Astrobytes: lol, you were correct about distracting MSmits eulerscheZahl :D
 MSmits: i was in it for about half the time
 eulerscheZahl: as i said: he won't beat me this month
 MSmits: beat you at what?
 eulerscheZahl: onitama
 Astrobytes: Onitama
 MSmits: probably not no
 Hjax: does the map wrap around? 
 darkhorse64: I did it 
 MSmits: though, it depends on the contest
 Illedan: No Hjax
 eulerscheZahl: no torus map
 MSmits: you beat euler darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64: yes
 MSmits: grats
 darkhorse64: I finished my bot yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for playing&#160;:)
 MSmits: though, if you beat euler, you must also beat royale, otherwise you interfere with the race for nr 1
 eulerscheZahl: no royale in that game
 MSmits: this is the rule
 MSmits: oh ok
 darkhorse64: Been tuning today. Early playout termination works
 inoryy: a contest :o
 MSmits: good to know
 eulerscheZahl: an inoryy :o
 MSmits: yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how are 25 people already submitting?
 eulerscheZahl: submit default code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and why?  i guess boss needs a boost
 Illedan: Boss was broken for 5 min :P
 Illedan: So someone made it through
 eulerscheZahl: boss was broken, but fixedsomething went wrong creating the contest
 LordGrimmauld: What should i do? Full game engine with Monte Carlo, like the Stockfish cess  engines?
 Hjax: hard to be stockfish with imperfect information 
 blasterpoard: monte carlo doesn't look right here
 MSmits: that's going to be interesting
 MSmits: I'm not used to imperfect information games
 eulerscheZahl: get the full rules before you decide
 struct: full rules bronze?
 Marchete: there are more rules?
 reCurse: Hjax Still working, did not have time to check yet. But I will only participate if the game motivates me enough.
 dbdr: &lt;/spoiler&gt;&#160;:)
 Marchete: great...
 eulerscheZahl: bronze = final rules
 Marchete: I said great
 Marchete: nvm thanks for your effort"
 Marchete:&#160;!
 LordGrimmauld: I think a code that tries not to surface will get me to bronze
 Illedan: Not sure about that
 Illedan: Too easy to find
 eulerscheZahl: the boss will chase you
 MSmits: I'm already loving this game
 blasterpoard: what is the time limit? is it in the bronze rules?
 MSmits: just from reading the description
 reCurse: Can you paste the bronze statement please
 Illedan: 50 ms
 eulerscheZahl: damn
 Illedan: 1 sec first round
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot that
 blasterpoard: thx
 Illedan: So 1 sec to find a good place to start
 eulerscheZahl: and illedan added it to our TODO 5s before me
 Illedan: :rocket:
 Marchete: MOVE direction POWER
 Marchete: power?
 Illedan: Torpedo
 Illedan: in this league
 eulerscheZahl: continue reading
 Illedan: then SONAR, SILENCE
 Illedan: and then MINE
 eulerscheZahl: MINE
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 PJA: will the engineer part of the game will be included?
 PJA: of the board game
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Illedan: No
 Illedan: oh
 Marchete: is that a board game then?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, what did the engineer do?
 Illedan: I should read the rules better
 Illedan: Captain Sonar Marchete
 PJA: the engineer need to brake abilitys
 reCurse: Bronze statement anyone?&#160;:'(
 Ajurna: i feel like the rules are missing some detial
 MSmits: probably a good idea to start this one in C# and then move to c++ if it's really necessary right euler?
 inoryy: is anyone even in bronze atm

 struct: maybe this one?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Illedan: Ajurna, yeah it might miss some detail. But feel free to ask and we will clearify + update the statement&#160;:)
 Eclipse_Storm: lol Captain Sonar &lt;3
 Hjax: ok cool i read the full problem statement 
 Hjax: i very much like this game 
 inoryy: semicolon not used for action separation, literally unplayable
 LordGrimmauld: the "|" is just fine
 Marchete: I like pipe more for separation
 eulerscheZahl: and x instead of # for islands
 Marchete: savages!
 yfprojects: I feel like the input for each turn has some mistakes or needs further explainations in Wood 2
 blasterpoard: do you visit all the cells you move throguh when you use silence, or only the last one?
 eulerscheZahl: all
 LordGrimmauld: silence would be a bit broken otherwise
 Hjax: mines dont trigger other mines right?
 eulerscheZahl: right
 Illedan: No
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, Ocean of social distancing ...
 Hjax: ok cool, its not UTG 2.0
 MSmits: Gonna tip my students about this contest, see if I can get 1 or 2 of them in here
 Marchete: they are in quarantine?
 Marchete: are they*
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: everyone is to some degree I guess
 eulerscheZahl: no school
 Marchete: I mean real real
 Hjax: man this contest is like xmas came early 
 Hjax: im so excited 
 eulerscheZahl: great
 MSmits: well they can go outside, but schools, restaurants, bars etc. all closed
 Marchete: we can't go out
 Marchete: only for basic needs
 MSmits: thats a dumb decision tbh
 Astrobytes: Looks like an interesting game, very nice
 Marchete: like buying food
 Marchete: not at all
 Marchete: Ì realized people is dumb
 inoryy: haven't been outside for like a week now, send help
 MSmits: will take years for the virus to disappear that way..
 inoryy: or actually don't
 Marchete: health facilites are saturated
 Hjax: regardless of the virus, its not like i would be going outside anyway, theres a contest to be won 
 Marchete: you can't just let all get sick at once
 MSmits: ah yes, in Spain it's different
 Marchete: and Italy
 MSmits: you have too many cases already
 eulerscheZahl: there is a contest because of Corona Hjax
 Marchete: but don't think other countries are special
 MSmits: Hjax has cause and effect confused
 Marchete: once it enters buses and metro
 Marchete: it's a pandemic
 MSmits: it is cultural also
 Marchete: maybe too
 MSmits: in italy people eat together with the whole family, including grandparents
 Marchete: I saw on norway people far away in buses
 Marchete: like 2 meters
 eulerscheZahl: and stocks going down -&gt; companies laying off people
 eulerscheZahl: that always helps populist parties
 inoryy: but everyone being sick hurts populist parties
 Marchete: but just don't think it's limited to some countries
 MSmits: I know
 Marchete: and not completely cultural, I can see UK metro as the same propagation vector than on Madrid
 PatrickMcGinnisII: local financial advisor got on FB bitching about his life...he just lost his people millions from their retirement plans, i hope he shoots himself
 Marchete: or any major metro
 MSmits: what i dont understand is this: Why forbid people from taking walks 
 MSmits: just walking around is not going to infect anyone
 Marchete: because people behave like children
 MSmits: it makes you healthier
 PatrickMcGinnisII: f'in bankers want bailouts...loosers
 yfprojects: Does a weapon loose its charge over time in OOC?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: except if you use it
 mel-mouk: MSmith because people don't respect the rules, in France people are using the "walk allowed" rules too meet up 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: UV kills viruses
 MSmits: I am going to the park with my wif eand daughter in an hour or so... just a walk, we avoid people = no problem
 Scarfield: "Have more lifes than your enemy at the end of the game."I cant find where it says the max amount of turns?
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, damn
 inoryy: end of universe, duh
 Hjax: lose conditions dont mention a timeout 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yesterday winds were like 20mph, so fake news released "virus spread by wind"...*insert&#160;%^^&amp;**((&amp;" here
 eulerscheZahl: Output an invalid command or don't respond in time.
 eulerscheZahl: got you Hjax
 Hjax: i mean a turn timeout 
 BenjaminUrquhart: 1 sec for first
 BenjaminUrquhart: 50 ms others
 Hjax: like, have less health after 100 rounds 
 MSmits: You cannot move on a cell you already visited before
 eulerscheZahl: Scarfield just said that
 MSmits: seems like a natural limit
 Hjax: unless you surface first @MSmits
 Hjax: surfacing resets it, but gives your opponent info 
 BenjaminUrquhart: unless you surface, but you lose health then
 duckymirror: That's a bug, isn't it? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440881032">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440881032</a>
 MSmits: yeah, so no turn limit is necessary
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's 400 frames
 MSmits: it will always end on its own
 Illedan: duckymirror, 7 7 is on an Island
 BenjaminUrquhart: ^
 Illedan: You can't start there
 Hjax: oh there is a turn limit? 
 MSmits: no
 duckymirror: Oh, it says output...
 eulerscheZahl: tbh no submarine survived long enough for me to know
 Hoyer: I agree with MSmits it seems to have  a natural limit
 Illedan: 300 I think
 duckymirror: Sorry...
 Illedan: :P
 AntiSquid: oh damn it's that game lol
 eulerscheZahl: cantain sonar
 eulerscheZahl: surprise
 MSmits: hjax, well just calculate how many free spaces there are, then multiple by x lives
 Hjax: oh i see, i guess you have to surface eventually 
 AntiSquid: wish i would have worked on that bot back then now&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: back then it was incomplete
 duckymirror: Oh, looks like I missed something in the rules...
 Scarfield: There is a natural limit, but the line: "Have more lifes than your enemy at the end of the game." implies that there is a max turn count
 eulerscheZahl: only wood2 rules
 aCat: TODO: along with screenshot, as this table uses concrete examples and isn't abstract?
 aCat: final rules i see&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: ignore that
 MSmits: Scarfield suggest... more likely
 Illedan: Ship it!
 Waffle3z: "the torpedo can be fired at an arbitrary water position within a range of 4 cells." 4 on both axes at the same time?
 Hjax: it appears you can silence 0 to avoid moving, is that true
 MSmits: 5 is more than 0
 inoryy: TODO: along with screenshot, as this table uses concrete examples and isn't abstract?
 Illedan: true Hjax
 Illedan: But you use 6 Powers for that..
 inoryy: maybe strip TODOs from description?&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: took what 3 years for the contest to happen? :P
 Hjax: so slightly longer than cells * lives
 Illedan: You can also use other skills and stand still
 BenjaminUrquhart: Waffle3z for anything that has to do with range: x range = where you can move in 4 turns
 Hjax: oh if you shoot a torpedo you dont have to move 
 Hjax: huh 
 Waffle3z: so manhattan and not chebyshev
 AntiSquid: starter bots?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 AntiSquid: well w/e full month ahead
 eulerscheZahl: open game in IDE, select languagethat's your starter bot
 sudomakeinstall2: do we know the initial position of openent?
 eulerscheZahl: hell no
 yfprojects: Will charges reset if charge another weapon?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 MSmits: sudomakeinstall2 that would defeat the purpose of the game&#160;:)
 sudomakeinstall2: so how does the bot fires at me as soon as i get in range of him?
 MSmits: he knows which way you went I suppuse
 Astrobytes: Used his sonar
 sudomakeinstall2: oh thanks
 MSmits: can you fool someone with an illegal order?
 eulerscheZahl: educated guessing, tracking your directions in the past turns and excluding some posistions that way
 BenjaminUrquhart: in the stub, do variables with the word 'cooldown" mean how many charges are left or how many you have
 eulerscheZahl: 0 = reday
 eulerscheZahl: ready
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok
 aCat: yep - the one thing that seems interesting in this game is opponent tracking&#160;;-)
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's also the one thing I'm bad at :upside_down:
 Scarfield: you will surface if you make an illegal order it seems
 Waffle3z: silence makes it hard, I track the opponent but reset on every silence and the boss silences too frequently
 MSmits: what does silence do exactly?
 reCurse: It's like someone took the fog of war part of WW and made a game out of it
 Waffle3z: so now I have to do some more complex space fitting business to figure out where they could have gone during the silence
 MSmits: Waffle3z that's the fun part I think
 Scarfield: silence is a move up to length 4, but you dont receive the direction of opps move
 Waffle3z: yeah, after enough turns the number of possible positions eventually is narrowed down to 1 and then gg
 Waffle3z: silence just makes that way harder
 MSmits: 4 seems like a lot
 MSmits: for silence
 reCurse: Very similar to UTG in a way too
 MSmits: and very different
 MSmits: it's just 1 sub
 MSmits: and no resource collection
 reCurse: Yeah but the whole game seems to revolve around guessing
 MSmits: true, only the guessing is far more central here
 MadKnight: what's UTG&#160;?
 Scarfield: Unleash the Geek
 MSmits: you could do reasonably well with UTG without too much guessing
 reCurse: aka Crystal Rush aka no one is gonna call that ever
 dbdr: does the torpedo hurt yourself?
 MSmits: aim it at the opponent dbdr
 MadKnight: Unleash your Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i started a few days
 reCurse: Pointy end towards the enemy
 dbdr: if you know where he is MSmits&#160;:)
 jacek: winter wrap up winter wrap up ~
 AntiSquid: hey anyone tried playing CR again?
 dbdr: thanks reCurse :D
 MadKnight: Unleash your MM and MCTS, there is a new contest
 AntiSquid: what is utg anyway, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what lang are you using?
 MSmits: just blast an island if you dont dbdr&#160;:)
 MSmits: blow up some sandcastles
 AntiSquid: idk people use weird acronyms right Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's not the same in c++
 reCurse: There might not be enough depth for a month
 reCurse: Pun intended
 MSmits: reCurse just surface occasionally
 MSmits: family will appreciate
 Astrobytes: No need to be salty :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: dbdr according to the referee torpedos hurt yourself
 AntiSquid: i find it weird they released CR and contest at the same itme
 dbdr: thanks BenjaminUrquhart
 MSmits: oh, there is a CR multi too?

 MSmits: yeah I found it
 MSmits: i just think it is weird my bot is in there
 AntiSquid: yes all contest bots from CR were auto submitted
 reCurse: It's the new system
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: Contest bots are auto pushed now
 Astrobytes: MSmits, they are autosubmitting all from now on
 MSmits: probably better that wya
 MostComplicatedUsername: ooo
 reCurse: And IIRC there won't be interruptions like 6 months with UTG
 MostComplicatedUsername: theres another contest
 reCurse: So game won't instantly die anymore
 MostComplicatedUsername: I hadn't realized
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think it's immediate now following contest end
 AntiSquid: well they also promised that they will be no break after contest when it ends and that you can play multi immediately
 reCurse: There's echo
 AntiSquid: mine is more concise 
 reCurse: &gt; More concise &gt; More words :thinking:
 programjames: How much time do you get for the first turn?
 eulerscheZahl: 1s
 eulerscheZahl: 50ms later
 programjames: Okay. Hopefully should be enough for BFS
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's more than enough time
 BenjaminUrquhart: provided it's a decent bfs
 MSmits: even if it is not
 MSmits: it's pretty hard to reach 50 ms with a bfs on this map
 reCurse: Or not a god-awful-why-did-you-do-it-in-lua one
 BenjaminUrquhart: Waffle3z would like to know your location reCurse
 reCurse: I thought I disabled that damn location service already
 reCurse: Deny
 MSmits: better disable it for this contest
 AntiSquid: he will have to fight his moose first, BenjaminGarnier
 Astrobytes: Grab it by the antlers
 yfprojects: What is a BFS?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: breadth first search
 AntiSquid: boat for sale yfprojects
 reCurse: In true spirit of this contest everyone should do bot hiding
 MSmits: best friend search
 AntiSquid: it's a ocean game after all
 Astrobytes: lol

 AntiSquid: it's a christmas toad
 eulerscheZahl: but i can't update the contest statement myself
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, will you make an avatar of a toad with a diving helmet
 eulerscheZahl: i know i missed 2 or 3 things there&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: avatar of a frog that can swim! :o
 MSmits: i liked on cthulhu you had a monster toad and on xmas rush i think it had a red hat
 eulerscheZahl: and the ice and fire toad on the throne
 AntiSquid: and on CR he had a crystal mining frog&#160;?
 MSmits: oh, i missed that one!! 
 emh: anyone has sonar working?

 MSmits: euler, brilliant&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: do you check in the turn after?
 emh: I print out the result every turn
 emh: always NA
 emh: but is because of silence maybe?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 yfprojects: @eulerscheZahl what about using that avatar if trump get's elected again.
 eulerscheZahl: i hope that won't happen
 yfprojects: Well it isn't unlikely
 AntiSquid: ya better Biden who has dementia? :p
 eulerscheZahl: bernie for president
 AntiSquid: let's be real, there's no good candidate
 yfprojects: As always, that's what everyone said last year.
 MostComplicatedUsername: That... doesn't make sense
 yfprojects: What?
 MostComplicatedUsername: If everyone always said it last year, then it was said for all time
 eulerscheZahl: @emh i'm struggling with SONAR too, investigating
 reCurse: Ah yes the good old "anyone who did something bad is equally as bad"
 Lachu: corona

 ThunderbirdOne: oh man, good thing emails are a thing
 ThunderbirdOne: didnt know about the competition
 AntiSquid: it popped out of nowhere
 ThunderbirdOne: you lose hitpoints for surfacing? that feels weird
 reCurse: I just realized how limitative it is to charge each action
 reCurse: It seems like you have many options but not really
 ThunderbirdOne: you only have a single charge meter right?
 reCurse: No it's per action
 ThunderbirdOne: ooh okay, so it's basically a cooldown? :p
 reCurse: To use silence you must specifically charge silence for 6 turns
 reCurse: Too bad if you could have used something else
 maxymczech: Should I use "MOVE N TORPEDO" or "MOVE N"?
 yfprojects: Do you want to charge the TORPEDO?
 ThunderbirdOne: so reCurse, you need to specifically charge an action?
 struct: this is confusing me a bit
 struct: (not visiting already visited cells or islands)
 ThunderbirdOne: if you don't, it doesn't charge?
 reCurse: Exactly
 ThunderbirdOne: so you output if you want to execute the action or if the action charge is below required charge?
 reCurse: Well read the statement -_-
 ThunderbirdOne: struct basically you can't go back to a place you've already been, unless when you surface
 ThunderbirdOne: this resets the visited cell array
 reCurse: So it's tron with 6 lives and superpowers
 yfprojects: So you have to surface at one point.
 maxymczech: hey guys
 maxymczech: which command do I use to move
 maxymczech: "MOVE N TORPEDO" or "MOVE N"
 ThunderbirdOne: i guess they put that in so you indeed have to surface at some point and it keeps the game from going on super long
 ThunderbirdOne: if you just want to move, just do MOVE
 ThunderbirdOne: but if you also want to charge torps, you also output that
 ThunderbirdOne: seperated witha  pipe
 ThunderbirdOne: so legally it would be MOVE N | TORPEDO
 eulerscheZahl: @emh found the SONAR bug, will update the game as soon as we can
 ThunderbirdOne: not sure if it can have spaces around the pipes?
 maxymczech: @ThunderbirdOne thank you
 yfprojects: ThunderbirdOne that would wrong
 maxymczech: That is not what it says in description though...
 yfprojects: You cant have the | between Move and Torpedo
 maxymczech: Your action: MOVE N TORPEDO
 yfprojects: I think spaces are ok
 emh: @eulerscheZahl thanks&#160;:)
 struct: Line 3: a summary of the actions (separated by |) that your opponent has made during its turn.Example: MOVE N |TORPEDO 3 5
 Astrobytes: maxymczech it says "Example: MOVE N |TORPEDO 3 5" just above the Output section. Not clear tho
 Astrobytes: The output section should state the 'POWER' is optional
 maxymczech: @Astrobytes thank you
 ThunderbirdOne: i was wondering why they were telling me i was wrong
 ThunderbirdOne: when clearly the information was right
 reCurse: Is there a turn limit eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: 200 frames
 reCurse: So 100 turns each?
 eulerscheZahl: we could increase up to 600 if needed i think
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 100 each
 reCurse: That seems very short but that's 100% speculative
 eulerscheZahl: you are probably right
 ThunderbirdOne: so, basically, once you hit your enemy (hp -2), you got him;.. since you get all his moves from that point on right?
 yfprojects: @ThunderbirdOne because you expressed wrongly
 ThunderbirdOne: what do you mean i expressed wrongly?
 eulerscheZahl: it was done very much in a hurry, right now it's more like open testing&#160;:(
 ThunderbirdOne: it's fine eulerscheZahl, this gives us something to do during the lockdowns :p
 yfprojects: Move N |Torpedo
 Astrobytes: All good eulerscheZahl, bugs can be ironed out and tweaked etc, just nice to have a contest!
 reCurse: That does seem problematic
 reCurse: But that's why you have silence
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO 3 3@ yfprojects
 reCurse: On the other hand though, hope you had one ready :p
 yfprojects: Move N |Torpedo is sth. else than Move N |Torpedo X Y or MOVE N Torpedo |...
 ThunderbirdOne: oh, wait... charging an action doesn't require a |?
 reCurse: No
 ThunderbirdOne: oh boy :P
 yfprojects: Yes that's what I am saying
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE N TORPEDO to charge
 eulerscheZahl: TORPEDO 3 3 to shoot
 ThunderbirdOne: you can only charge 1 action per turn?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 ThunderbirdOne: sorry, new here :p
 Astrobytes: Yep
 ThunderbirdOne: okay
 ThunderbirdOne: hmmm
 ThunderbirdOne: interesting
 duckymirror: How is the distance to the torpedo target calculated?
 struct: ahhhh
 eulerscheZahl: movement dist
 reCurse: Do you get the charge for the current turn
 duckymirror: Manhattan?
 eulerscheZahl: you get the missing charges to be ready
 eulerscheZahl: not manhattan, BFS distance
 Astrobytes: BFS duckymirror
 struct: so I can charge and instantly shoot?
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to shoot your torpedo around an island
 struct: if it was not readfy?
 reCurse: So if you had 2 charges of torpedo, you could MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO
 eulerscheZahl: yes struct
 eulerscheZahl: but that means you have to move first and then shoot
 struct: can you move after?
 eulerscheZahl: TORPEDO 3 3 | MOVE N TORPEDOis possible too
 duckymirror: I'm trying to figure out why I get an out of range error in one case...
 struct: Oh nice
 eulerscheZahl: but only if it was fully charged before
 reCurse: Ok makes sense
 struct: yes I understand
 eulerscheZahl: that also affects your range
 eulerscheZahl: as it uses the old vs new location
 struct: it is based on state before move
 ThunderbirdOne: does anything happen when you charge a fully charged action?
 struct: no
 eulerscheZahl: you waste a charge action
 wlesavo: is torpedo have a speed of 1?
 reCurse: You should auto lose
 Scarfield: Torpedo overcharged, self destruct imminent
 Waffle3z: are cooldown and charge different?
 Scarfield: charge subtracts 1 from cooldown
 eulerscheZahl: cooldown = missing charge to use it
 yfprojects: Does the torpedo need time to travel? @elerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: hint: eu[tab] for autocomplete
 eulerscheZahl: then you don't misspell me
 yfprojects: Oh didnt know that
 reCurse: You can also invite him to a clash to grab his attention
 eulerscheZahl: :rage:
 Scarfield: but at the risk of autocompleting a different name with the same starting letters&#160;;)
 yfprojects: I will think about that
 eulerscheZahl: EugenioToshiAmato changed his nick just for me, even if he was on CG first
 eulerscheZahl: i still feel sorry for telling him as a joke
 Scarfield: lol xD
 eulerscheZahl: now he's ToshiTuringMachine
 reCurse: But now it conflicts with Tobou
 tobk: can you take damage from your own torpedo?
 Scarfield: yes 
 eulerscheZahl: Tobou can delete the account, solved
 Astrobytes: lol
 Marchete: simple solutions
 ThunderbirdOne: it is rather simple, it just needs some social pressure
 ThunderbirdOne: easy

 Scarfield: tobk
 struct: Maybe I will have to delete
 eulerscheZahl: and Scarfield knows the codebase better than me already
 yfprojects: So does the damage go through diagonally walls?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, damage spreads
 Waffle3z: I see the wood 1 boss saying "MOVE W SILENCE" and not "SILENCE W" does that make it silent?
 eulerscheZahl: but the torpedo itself can only take water cells
 eulerscheZahl: charge SILENCE
 yfprojects: Because on discord yo said different
 eulerscheZahl: SILENCE W 1 for sneaks
 eulerscheZahl: or a higher dist, but only 1 for the boss
 Waffle3z: what does a higher distance do? move more than 1 space in a single turn?
 yfprojects: i think so
 eulerscheZahl: yes, silence can make you move up to 4 cells
 eulerscheZahl: in 1 direction, no corners like torpedoes
 Scarfield: I just copy pasted a comment from benjamin, havent even looked at the link lol, but i will take the credit :p
 MadKnight: what algos are u guys using for this one&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: C#
 Scarfield: MaddyMax
 reCurse: GA of course
 Astrobytes: Monte Carlo Mini-Annealing with Gamma pruning and recursive shallowing
 eulerscheZahl: ping emh still there
 Illedan: GA will be good yes
 eulerscheZahl: SONAR should be fixed, can you check please?i'm in wood2, so i can't&#160;:(
 Illedan: Same&#160;:(
 Waffle3z: submit the default code to get out of wood 2
 Eclipse_Storm: if { if { if { if { if { if { if... best algo
 Illedan: Don't work. Boss is fixed
 struct: what needs to be checked?
 Illedan: If sonar works now
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11f31510-9aa0-4e0d-9c04-ebe887e39e42">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11f31510-9aa0-4e0d-9c04-ebe887e39e42</a>
 eulerscheZahl: does it print a Y and N on stderr sometimes?
 eulerscheZahl: (if you don't spawn on an island)
 eulerscheZahl: for wood1 users
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: Yep, working
 Waffle3z: getting "Timeout!" and no output, it refuses to tell me what's in stderr
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl it's working
 yfprojects: @Waffle3z i think thats normal
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/d7bILFv.gifv">https://i.imgur.com/d7bILFv.gifv</a>
 eulerscheZahl: just confirmed myself, working
 Astrobytes: struct you need to print the sonarResult
 struct: :p
 eulerscheZahl: saiksyApo promoted me manually&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: now I lost an opportunity on 25XP
 dbdr: rip
 yfprojects: What is GA?
 Astrobytes: Put in a claim :P
 struct: unpromote
 struct: this is not fair
 struct: I worked hard to get wood 1
 Astrobytes: yfprojects Genetic algorithm
 Waffle3z: errors don't go to the output, I have to mouse over the red line in the replay to see what the error is
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i tweaked the boss to make it harder for you struct
 struct: also firing into island returns "out of range"
 struct: just little details
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, invalid move or whatever would be nice in the info output actually
 eulerscheZahl: because you can't reach the island
 struct: yes I understand
 reCurse: Fix your code
 dbdr: hum, 0-0? :D
 dbdr: ah yes, suicide :D
 Waffle3z: wood 1 boss is just too powerful
 Waffle3z: it knows where I am
 Astrobytes: Fix it Waffle3z
 yfprojects: Bye, have a nice evening! I am going offline now!
 yyellowflashh: hey wassup
 AntiSquid: what are the directions? N W E S&#160;?
 struct: is it based on this game eulerscheZahl?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171131/captain-sonar">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171131/captain-sonar</a>
 Illedan: yes
 eulerscheZahl: read the statement struct, 1st sentence
 eulerscheZahl: F5 if it's not written there
 Nixerrr: :joy_cat:
 tobk: what is the format for "MSG"? Can it contain a "|"?
 struct: yeah sorry
 struct: it was not showing before 
 struct: havent refreshed
 Illedan: tobk, MSG can not contain |
 eulerscheZahl: i think not @tobk
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: I took time to beat wood 2
 dbdr: now i'm #2 in wood 1 directly
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't even started yet&#160;:(
 ThunderbirdOne: same...
 ThunderbirdOne: watching Jimmy Broadbent on youtube&#160;:')
 dbdr: even beat the wood 1 boss
 dbdr: who wrote the bosses?
 eulerscheZahl: G_Rom started
 eulerscheZahl: i tweaked them
 Illedan: Nice dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: the boss only moved and only used torpedoes when it was 100% sure about the opponent position
 dbdr: thanks Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: not it's more trigger-happy
 eulerscheZahl: now*
 dbdr: I felt really slow to promote
 eulerscheZahl: hard boss?
 eulerscheZahl: or slow submit?
 dbdr: hard boss
 Illedan: Hard boss yeh
 dbdr: which is fine
 Illedan: for a contest this long, it's fine yeah
 dbdr: well, you might need to nerf it eventually
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan forgot to make it SURFACE every 25 turns
 dbdr: if too many people get stuck
 Illedan: I wrote it on TODO and never did it :D
 dbdr: feels unusually strong to me
 Illedan: Yeah it is
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote a TODO in the statement directly
 dbdr: but that happened before, can't recll which contest now
 eulerscheZahl: kutulu
 Illedan: I did beat it 2 years ago, but I used 3 hours or so
 eulerscheZahl: which was my boss&#160;:(
 dbdr: 2 years ago? this boss?
 eulerscheZahl: and now it's a stronger boss than in the contrib
 Illedan: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: really old prototype
 dbdr: ah ok :D
 Illedan: I played the prototype with only moving + torpedo 2 years ago :P
 eulerscheZahl: older than the kutulu contest
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the contribution but never played
 dbdr: no new rules in wood 1, strange
 dbdr: seems there is a lot of new things in bronze
 eulerscheZahl: then it was broken (pixi.js update)
 eulerscheZahl: there should be sonar+silence in w1
 eulerscheZahl: there are
 eulerscheZahl: sorry for no green highlighting
 dbdr: I don't think I ever was top 2 in a contest :champagne:
 eulerscheZahl: i was, i have screenshots to prove :D
 eulerscheZahl: the gallery of popped dreams
 dbdr: I thought I did not like sprints, but...
 dbdr: can we still change the rules?&#160;;)
 Scarfield: end the contest now you mean? :D
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: oh, I have crashes
 eulerscheZahl: do you understand the name of the wood1 boss?
 dbdr: i don't understand any boss name
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMsblGTAdM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMsblGTAdM</a>
 Astrobytes: He's Captain Birdseye in UK, or was
 Astrobytes: But I got it
 eulerscheZahl: yay
 Astrobytes: Also, should be Cpt not Ctp&#160;;)
 dbdr: right, I vaguely remember some ad for frozen food
 eulerscheZahl: and the other is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/689865717067284592/690597589279834192/450.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/689865717067284592/690597589279834192/450.png</a>
 dbdr: Levine?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: lol, wasn't in wood 2 long enough to register it, wp
 Waffle3z: can you go silent and just not move? SILENCE N 0
 dbdr: HIDE
 dbdr: DIVE DEEP
 Waffle3z: BUY TOILET PAPER
 Astrobytes: DIVE DIVE DIVE
 struct: do mines trigger mines?
 ThunderbirdOne: Waffle3z you can't not move... because you already visited that cell
 dbdr: wait, there are new commands in wood 1?
 dbdr: isn't there something missing in the statement to announce it? eulerscheZahl Illedan
 Scarfield: "This allows you to move 0 to 4 cells in a given direction", it seems you can from the rules, but idk
 Illedan: Correct Waffle3z
 eulerscheZahl: you mean a green highlighting? or the text telling that there will be more rules?
 eulerscheZahl: hmm...&#160;:/
 dbdr: both
 dbdr: definitely the green
 Illedan: Time was an issue.
 dbdr: usually there is also a popup, right?
 Scarfield: Die Grünes
 dbdr: sure, that's fine
 Illedan: Easier to just help you out in chat&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: we agreed on not making a popup before
 eulerscheZahl: not forgotten, planned
 dbdr: OK
 dbdr: the green would be nice
 Illedan: struct, no. Mines and Torpedo doesn't trigger other mines
 Astrobytes: That would be the sequel, Tidal Wave of Code
 eulerscheZahl: i can add a green, but not push it in productionnot sure if i want to ping staff just for a green color
 dbdr: nah, it's not urgent
 dbdr: esp with a marathon
 Illedan: I guess we can queue it up for changes on monday
 dbdr: but they are confined, so they might be lurking&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, along with 600 turns
 Waffle3z: lmao <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/440910957">https://www.codingame.com/replay/440910957</a>
 Illedan: We should write about the 600 turns on forum
 Illedan: :D Waffle3z
 eulerscheZahl: you should :P
 Illedan: On it
 Astrobytes: lol Waffle3z
 eulerscheZahl: right, i wanted to have a look at the map generator to see if such cases are possible&#160;:(
 Illedan: Nah, I find it funny
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: Isn't it more that the boss is choosing the wrong place to spawn?
 Illedan: means you have to check it too
 Illedan: Boss is just n00b
 eulerscheZahl: the boss takes a random cell with water
 eulerscheZahl: so the large area is mor elikely
 eulerscheZahl: but in this case... :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tron all over again, sigh ... the visited cells ugh
 Illedan: Just surface and try again
 ThunderbirdOne: btw, just noticed this
 ThunderbirdOne: 30 day competition?
 ThunderbirdOne: this is going to be brutal
 ThunderbirdOne: no rush though
 Astrobytes: You know you'll submit the day before it ends ThunderbirdOne :P
 ThunderbirdOne: always
 ThunderbirdOne: i procrastinate
 Astrobytes: :D
 ThunderbirdOne: there's nothing like a deadline to turn on the pressure
 ThunderbirdOne: i've had work weeks where i delay, and tell my team i'm doing well and it'll be done soon
 ThunderbirdOne: only to finish the entire story in a single day
 ThunderbirdOne: just before my colleagues would get suspicious...
 ThunderbirdOne: and THAT is the power of doing daily standips :p
 ThunderbirdOne: it gives procrastinators less time to screw around
 Astrobytes: daily standups? Is that an agile thing?
 ThunderbirdOne: aye
 ThunderbirdOne: basically, at a fixed time every day
 ThunderbirdOne: you get the team together
 Astrobytes: Yeah I get the concept
 ThunderbirdOne: and you just say very briefly this is wha ti did yesterday, i'm gonna do this today, and i think i might have problems with this
 Astrobytes: Works great then :P
 ThunderbirdOne: it's nice
 ThunderbirdOne: aye
 ThunderbirdOne: you can only keep up the facade for that many days without any commits before the team gets suspicious :D
 AntiSquid: is range 4 here like range 4 in CR&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol
 ThunderbirdOne: manhattan distance i suppose?
 Astrobytes: BFS AntiSquid
 Waffle3z: path length
 AntiSquid: don't understand
 AntiSquid: ok thx wayneww
 AntiSquid: Waffle3z
 Fabden: how can i debug in python clash code&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crazy Ivan
 struct: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr)
 Fabden: thank 
 ThunderbirdOne: right, time to open a new github repo
 ThunderbirdOne: and copy the starter code to a new VS project
 Qurtin: It's always the right time to open a github repo. 
 ThunderbirdOne: haha
 Astrobytes: Making giant leaps here ThunderbirdOne
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, imagine that
 ThunderbirdOne: starting on day 1
 Astrobytes: I've never seen the likes :D
 ThunderbirdOne: I'm learning
 Astrobytes: heheh
 ThunderbirdOne: I should fine a way to remote into my work laptop from my gaming rig =]
 ThunderbirdOne: so i wouldn't have to switch my keyboard, mouse and screens all the time
 ThunderbirdOne: I'm sure the ops guys at my current client would very much not agree :p
 Astrobytes: lel, possibly not :P
 ThunderbirdOne: not even using my own ^^' 
 ThunderbirdOne: well, company laptop... but still
 AntiSquid: game looks like lots of headache
 ThunderbirdOne: possibly
 AntiSquid: shit ton to keep track of&#160;:/
 ThunderbirdOne: i was imagining keeping a list of cells the enemy could be at
 ThunderbirdOne: like if he moves E on first move... that eliminates every cell that is on the E edge, or W of land
 ThunderbirdOne: and slowly make that list smaller and smaller :p
 ThunderbirdOne: but SILENCE kind of screws that up
 Waffle3z: that's what I'm doing, including listing new possible positions every time they go silent
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, makes sense
 Waffle3z: which basically almost resets it because there are tons of new positions they can be in
 ThunderbirdOne: when they surface, you can seriously limit the options
 ThunderbirdOne: or when they fire off a torp as well, since that has a specific range
 ThunderbirdOne: nowhere near implementing that though
 Waffle3z: you can also fire off a torpedo at a suspected position and see if they took damage the next turn
 ThunderbirdOne: aye
 ThunderbirdOne: if you miss, you also know those cells are NOT where the opponent is at
 Waffle3z: although they could have damaged themselves in some other way
 ThunderbirdOne: ah shit, yeah
 shutwe: is it possible to export code, to test/try on idle? 
 Scarfield: you would know if they have surfaced though
 eulerscheZahl: "i was imagining keeping a list of cells the enemy could be at"you summarize what the referee does ThunderbirdOne
 ThunderbirdOne: haha, haven't read that yet
 eulerscheZahl: it's private
 eulerscheZahl: the public repo is without boss
 ThunderbirdOne: aha
 eulerscheZahl: i meant boss above, not referee&#160;:(
 ThunderbirdOne: that makes more sense
 ThunderbirdOne: kind of want to play doom eternal atm... but i can't reach my gaming rig
 ThunderbirdOne: it's temporarily connected to tv because of reno... but that means mouse + kb on coffee table = sore back
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's been 4 hours and I'm still designing the data structures for my bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: hm
 blasterpoard: BenjaminUrquhart don't; you'll delete it anyway
 ThunderbirdOne: I tend to not spend too much time on design... I feel like it'll emerge :p
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't give me that
 icecream17: ugh i'm still trying to beat the first boss on the wood league. i'm overcomplicating things probably.
 BenjaminUrquhart: first boss can be beaten by submitting the stub code 
 eulerscheZahl: boss might be too strong
 BenjaminUrquhart: or at least it was beatable that way when the contest started
 blasterpoard: icecream17 nope, the boss is much tougher than you standard wood bosses... it was broken it the first couple of minutes, but then it got fixed
 blasterpoard: *your
 BenjaminUrquhart: so I got lucky then
 icecream17: I already have 122 lines of code
 blasterpoard: 350 here ^^
 icecream17: *don't know if that's a lot
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have 254 and no AI
 eulerscheZahl: and i will never get that 25XP for wood2-&gt;wood1 promotion :cry:
 ThunderbirdOne: it's fine... project i'm working on right now... RouteConfig alone is like 2K lines of code&#160;:(
 BenjaminUrquhart: last contest everyone had like 2k lines
 ThunderbirdOne: they defined all the routing in there, instead of using the controller action attributes
 ThunderbirdOne: and it's all non-standard routes
 icecream17: Right now, there's a 1 space gap where my ship keeps getting stuck. It just so happens to be perfectly aligned.
 eulerscheZahl: i had almost exactly 1k lines in the last contest BenjaminUrquhart
 ThunderbirdOne: instead of the /{controllername}/{action}
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl I had exactly 1700 
 eulerscheZahl: 976
 eulerscheZahl: which is not 2000
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok
 eulerscheZahl: i never reached 2000
 struct: euler I have one question
 struct: So
 eulerscheZahl: i have one too
 eulerscheZahl: when delete?
 eulerscheZahl: but you first
 struct: If enemy has torpedo available
 struct: and he uses it outside range cell
 struct: I still get that action
 struct: has enemy made it
 struct: He can like trick me to think he was in that range
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i think you should not get the action then...
 struct: but it happens
 struct: I just tried
 eulerscheZahl: then it's to be added on our TODO
 icecream17: I'm still working on moving the boat... I feel bad
 struct: damn i should have used this to get to legend
 Quidome: He everyone, this is great, thxs to you all wha made this happen :D
 struct: so euler the intended thing is to only get legal actions right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: illedan's job though
 eulerscheZahl: my responsibilities are limited to the statement, boss and tooltips :D
 eulerscheZahl: no complains about tooltips yet B)
 Astrobytes: Hey struct, that font on the tooltips sucks huh
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: You humourless people
 ThunderbirdOne: :D
 icecream17: "Yes! I found a bug!" I say. Then I hear "Whaa? Why would...? Ew"
 BenjaminUrquhart: ew
 icecream17: That was an amazing comment Benjamin
 BenjaminUrquhart: thank you
 ThunderbirdOne: there we go, Github repo made... now to clone it locally
 struct: So lets see if I find more bugs
 Astrobytes: #winning ThunderbirdOne
 struct: but about the statement
 struct: I just dont think this sounds fine
 eulerscheZahl: shush
 struct: (not visiting already visited cells or islands)
 eulerscheZahl: can you elaborate on it more?
 struct: maybe its my english
 struct: I cant understand it
 Waffle3z: does it matter what order MOVE|TORPEDO/TORPEDO|MOVE is in?
 struct: Not visiting already visited cells
 struct: ah I see
 eulerscheZahl: Waffle3z as a native speaker, is that fine?
 struct: not moving to already visited cells
 eulerscheZahl: that's the intention, yes
 struct: a&lt;h
 struct: ah
 struct: Now I fully understand
 eulerscheZahl: the order makes a difference
 struct: The path must not cross
 struct: visited cells
 struct: right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 icecream17: Is it possible... to stay still? It doesn't say.
 struct: no
 struct: you must move
 Scarfield: it is, with silence 0 (?)
 eulerscheZahl: you can stay
 eulerscheZahl: silence 0 or any other action
 AntiSquid: surface&#160;! you stand still
 eulerscheZahl: you only need 1 action, so shooting a torpedo gives you an opportunity to wait
 AntiSquid: oh
 icecream17: great. now it's even more complicated
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: lol
 struct: I got 3 tooltips in 1 error
 dbdr: oh, I also thought you had to move
 AntiSquid: so is this going to open up a new league every friday?
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: like locam

 eulerscheZahl: bar of invalidity
 Illedan: gj
 Illedan: Print it, put it on your wall
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice
 eulerscheZahl: IMO invalid commands belong in the game summary, not that event bar
 eulerscheZahl: :shrugs:
 Illedan: I think I will remove a whole lot of event bar stuff in bronze and above
 Illedan: Only show when player takes damage
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'll go to bed
 Illedan: You do
 eulerscheZahl: cat agrees
 Illedan: And I'll get 1st until you wake up
 Illedan: :D
 struct: just trying to see whats wrong
 struct: if you want I dont report
 Illedan: Read the toolbar items struct
 AntiSquid: the world is
 Illedan: They say what command is invalid
 Illedan: and such
 Astrobytes: Yeah, game summary should show invalid actions I think
 Astrobytes: ooh I lag
 struct: I know Illedan
 Codrepository: HELLO
 Illedan: Was triggerhappy on the Tooltips :D
 Codrepository: HOW ARE YOU?
 struct: it even crashes my browser
 struct: I guess If I submit and someone opens replay
 icecream17: YAS YES YES YAS yes yes Finally I can't believe it works!... wait what? [ignore this]
 struct: they also crash
 struct: this is not good
 struct: this is a problem*
 struct: maybe sounds better
 Illedan: crashes browser?
 Illedan: What replay?

 BenjaminUrquhart: you sure?
 Illedan: I should just crash in that case :thinking:

 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Hide your kids
 Astrobytes: hahaa
 AntiSquid: how is Valgrowth still in wood2? 
 MSmits: hmm is negative shift possible in c++?
 AntiSquid: i thought 0 hours shift is bad
 MSmits:   0b10011001  &lt;&lt; -1
 Scarfield: &gt;&gt;&#160;?&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: but that didn't answer the question
 AntiSquid: maybe it doesn't question the answer
 Scarfield: 42 if in doubt
 dbdr: MSmits I don't think so, but double check
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's legitimate, but will shift by the modulo of the precision, hence an abs shift left i believe
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl what happens if we silence and move at the same time
 Scarfield: it seems shifting with negative numbers is undefined behaviour, but why not just use &gt;&gt; 1 instead?
 MSmits: ah it's just annoying if you can't. I can do an if statement
 Astrobytes: @BenjaminUrquhart euler's asleep now man
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it should pass the compiler, but the expected result is junk i believe
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm not paying attention
 struct: Think like this
 MSmits: I have a shift map function and I would have preferred to make it branchless and tidy
 struct: moves happen in the order you output
 struct: you silence to position 
 struct: then you can move
 struct: But you can try
 dror1212: um, how do I advence in the legues? :sweat_smile:
 Scarfield: you can move after silence? i assumed it was only one "moving action" per turn
 struct: ok ill test
 AntiSquid: valgrowth has become the 2nd wood2 boss :D

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Fatal error: Uncaught ArithmeticError: Bit shift by negative number   php throws exception
 ThunderbirdOne: php though;..
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was curious if it would check it

 Astrobytes: :d
 dror1212: um, how do I advence in the legues? :sweat_smile:
 struct: you need to submit
 struct: and be above boss ranking
 struct: after all matches are complete
 dror1212: oh ok thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid I'm further along than that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there is a BFS in the referee for the really lazy
 AntiSquid: i am extremely lazy right now, don't feel like even taking that rn
 Illedan: ValGrowth stuck?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Illedan: Did he try to resubmit?
 BattlePirate_9000: i just finished a 4 hour course on python, im a self taught programmer now right
 AntiSquid: he is now a wood2 Boss
 Astrobytes: I'm not doing anything until tomorrow tbh
 AntiSquid: i go sleep
 Astrobytes: other than watching SeebOmega's amazing bilingual stream
 struct: I still havent done anything too
 struct: Reading rules
 ThunderbirdOne: i made a GH repo and pasted the code into VS
 ThunderbirdOne: then pushed that to GH repo
 ThunderbirdOne: that's about as far as i got&#160;:')
 ThunderbirdOne: also noticed i had a shitton of updates for VS2019
 SeebOmega: best map

 Scarfield: thats rough
 Illedan: Lol SeebOmega. nailed it!
 dbdr: good choice
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: have you started a bot MSmits?
 Astrobytes: dbdr I bet you 16 bits he's at least 32 bits into one of his 64 bit representations of something
 Astrobytes: :P
 dbdr: :D
 struct: with 16 bits I can do 16 sims at once
 MSmits: dbdr, yeah I am just working on my bitboard
 Astrobytes: See, I told you
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: did you even look at the full rules?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: somewhat
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: Wonder if you need bitboard
 Illedan: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Saw the board and bitboarded instantly
 MSmits: it's not a matter of "need"
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: write bitboard first, read the rules later
 MSmits: it's simply easier to use
 PatrickMcGinnisII: this is more like pirates, am i wrong?
 struct: So in what you store
 MSmits: you really want to make an object out of every square?
 Astrobytes: Hell naw
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: I can store so much information on that cell
 MSmits: I am even using C++
 Astrobytes: Ooh straight to base this time
 MSmits: I first made a C# project and I wanted to start coding, but I just gave up before the first line
 MSmits: i mean why even bother when everything is gonna be bitboarded
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: Why wait 3 weeks when you can do it today
 MSmits: at least in c++ I can do if(a &amp; b)
 Astrobytes: You can't do that in C#?
 MSmits: instead of if ((a&amp; b) &gt; 0)
 MSmits: no you cant
 Astrobytes: Fk that language lol
 Illedan: -.-
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the tricks to finding the enemy are interesting
 Astrobytes: I was sort of liking some C# recently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hacing to be &lt; 4 squares kinda sucks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or &lt;=4
 MSmits: I like it when I need to make very complex sims with many objects
 MSmits: this is not one of those games
 Illedan: Don't need to sim it?
 blasterpoard: about 30 turns in, you know where the opponent is
 MSmits: oh i might need to, but it wont be complex I think
 MSmits: the strategy will be
 blasterpoard: the only thing that stops you from knowing is silence
 MSmits: but the simming I dont think so
 Illedan: Not really blasterpoard
 Illedan: There is more stuff to do
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 dbdr: MSmits that's compiled to the same thing
 MSmits: I know it's compiled the same
 dbdr: if ((a&amp; b) &gt; 0) in C#
 MSmits: it just reads bad
 dbdr: so does it matter?
 dbdr: ok...
 struct: I need those extra chars
 MSmits: yeah, bitboards are hard  to read as it is
 MSmits: i dont want it to be any harder with more parentheses
 struct: My CSB is 60k chars atm
 struct: and no search
 Astrobytes: I agree with his preference, anything that makes bitwise stuff read better is better imo :D
 blasterpoard: Illedan sure, you can move in a way that gives the opponent very little info... but when the first torpedo is fired, sim begins
 Astrobytes: You're still working on that rn struct?#
 struct: no
 struct: Now Ill do AVX on ooc
 blasterpoard: and usually even before that
 Astrobytes: oh ok, hahaha
 Illedan: True blaster
 Illedan: We'll see
 Illedan: Wonder what the meta will become
 MSmits: why is it a sim?
 MSmits: doesnt the torpedo just go boom
 MSmits: it doesnt move or anything?
 blasterpoard: no, it tells the opponent you're in 4 range from the explosion
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: not yet
 struct: due to bug
 struct: but yeah
 blasterpoard: you'll probably have to hide by going silent in teh same turn
 MSmits: depends. you can sonar yourself
 MSmits: and know what the opponent knows
 Illedan: huh?
 MSmits: keep track of what he knows of you
 MSmits: sonar yourself
 Illedan: ofc
 blasterpoard: get silence -&gt; get torpedo -&gt; find opponent -&gt; torpedo him and silence away
 blasterpoard: repeat
 Illedan: We'll see&#160;;)
 MSmits: if you torpedo the opponent and he still has like 7 squares to guess from, you dont need to silence
 Illedan: I have a different meta in my mind
 icecream17: how do you sonar
 MSmits: passively
 MSmits: you receive information
 MSmits: every turn
 icecream17: oh
 MSmits: you also know what the opponent receives of you
 blasterpoard: he's probably asking about sonar action ^^
 icecream17: yeah.
 MSmits: oh, i have no clue about that
 icecream17: ok
 MSmits: i just thought people referred to the information gathering process
 Illedan: SONAR is used to check if the enemy is located in a specific section of the map
 blasterpoard: select a segment, next turn you learn whether the opponent is there or not
 Illedan: *was there blaster
 MSmits: sonar is not in wood 2:P
 icecream17: so the range of the torpedo, does '4' mean from say, x - 2 to x + 2, or x - 4 to x + 4?
 MSmits: neither
 MSmits: it's within 4 movement steps
 MSmits: floodfill it
 icecream17: sigh
 MSmits: I am starting with random sub placement
 MSmits: but apparently that can get you stuck in a 1 cell basin
 Illedan: Pick a random in center
 Astrobytes: Flood from potential placement MSmits
 MSmits: anyone got a snipped to split opponent orders?
 MSmits: in c++&#160;?
 MSmits: thats the most painful thing about c++.. string manipulation
 MSmits: snippet that is
 MSmits: I think i have a bot somewhere that uses an illegible piece of code that does this
 struct: locam
 MSmits: nah, C# bot
 MSmits: I think it's maybe one of my opening book readers
 MSmits: split on spaces I think
 blasterpoard: while(getline(orders, token, '|')) { 
 blasterpoard: maybe
 blasterpoard: token,orders = string
 Astrobytes: Did it in CalM, did you c++ that
 blasterpoard: tokens = vector&lt;string&gt;
 MSmits: Astrobytes nope, also C#
 MSmits: ok thanks blasterpoard, will try
 Astrobytes: o ok
 blasterpoard: MSmits orders might have to be a stringstream
 blasterpoard: im not sure
 MSmits: me neither :P
 MSmits: what language are you using?&gt;
 blasterpoard: C++, but I avoid string whenever I can
 dror1212: is there a way to know where the enemy started?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: that's the point&#160;:)
 dror1212: ok, just made sure XD

 MSmits: thanks pmor, what is strtok?
 pmor: c function that splits a string by a token
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: str wont accept string?
 blasterpoard: it will probably convert implicitly
 blasterpoard: just try putting it there
 MSmits: no suitable conversion function from "std::string" to "char *" exists
 blasterpoard: if not, theres string::c_str()
 Astrobytes: ^
 pmor: you need to .c_str() your string
 MSmits: k
 Astrobytes: And yeah nice, much better than ss pmor
 pmor: with std::string, you can also use .find() and substring()
 pmor: but I think strtok is a bit simpler
 Astrobytes: less hassle at least
 pmor: downside is that your working with char*'s...easy to mess it up
 Astrobytes: Not like we're gonna continue to operate on them much tho after splitting
 Astrobytes: In this case
 MSmits: c_str() seems to require a const char*
 MSmits: I mean return
 MSmits: strtok uses a non-const char*
 pmor: (char*)str.c_str()
 pmor: or const_cast&lt;char*&gt;(str.c_str())
 MSmits: thanks
 Astrobytes: Nobody is gonna check your code so use the C-style cast :P
 MSmits: people cant check my code because it's unreadable
 MSmits: well not yet, but give it time
 darkhorse64: Let's say it goes straight to the point
 MSmits: what point?
 Astrobytes: You tell us! :P
 MSmits: I dunno yet&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: In other words, a direct approach to a problem with no fancy features
 MSmits: depends on how you define fancy 
 darkhorse64: elegant
 Astrobytes: Hence C-style casts, bypassing most nice C++ features
 MSmits: there's a lot of fancy bit manipulation in my stuff, but I wouldn't call most of it elegant
 darkhorse64: smart not fancy
 MSmits: right yeah
 Astrobytes: *'features'
 BenjaminUrquhart: imagine using your actions<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440941743">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/440941743</a>
 pmor: I write mainly full c++ normally...but these contests my code is more C-ish than C++ :P
 MSmits: if that means you use very few classes then mine is too
 PJA: what happens first? movment or torpedo?
 Astrobytes: Not just that MSmits, just not utilizing the features of C++
 MSmits: ah 
 MSmits: I probably dont use them either
 Astrobytes: *most of the features of modern
 MSmits: I would have to know them :P
 Hjax: alright! time to get started on this new game :D 
 Hjax: and by that i mean, time to spend the next few hours parsing the inputs into something useful 
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's what I just did lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: my bot does nothing but move to an available space
 Hjax: its surprisingly time consuming just making all of the data structures you want 
 Hjax: especially when you keep changing your mind like i do 
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's been 5 hours
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm not done yet
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bad5bddf-72c3-4964-8607-5d6fb755dcc5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bad5bddf-72c3-4964-8607-5d6fb755dcc5</a>
 MSmits: thats what I used before
 Hjax: i mean like, making my representation of the game state 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I bitboarded for memes
 MSmits: so... like 15 uint16_t Hjax?
 icecream17: If your opponent does multiple actions what do you see?
 Hjax: is bitboarding the play here?
 BenjaminUrquhart: action | action | action...
 Hjax: i was going to use arrays 
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: islands[15]
 BenjaminUrquhart: it was somehow easier for me to bitboard then use an array
 MSmits: whats the difference?
 BenjaminUrquhart: well I still use an array
 BenjaminUrquhart: private int[] tiles;
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: oh, you mean like map[225]&#160;??
 BenjaminUrquhart: map[15][15]
 MSmits: right
 Hjax: oh i was thinking you meant like, one 225 bit int using some big int class 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I mean
 BenjaminUrquhart: I could
 BenjaminUrquhart: but that's just excessive
 MSmits: nah, a row almost fits perfectly in 16 bit
 Hjax: thats true 
 BenjaminUrquhart: fixed
 Culpit: Hey
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok so explain something to me
 Culpit: What?
 BenjaminUrquhart: in java, shifting a number that's smaller than an int automatically upcats it to int
 BenjaminUrquhart: upcasts*
 BenjaminUrquhart: why
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 Culpit: You sure?
 Hjax: he is correct, idk why 
 Culpit: I guess it's because java is weird
 MSmits: that sounds like python shenanigans
 struct: well you can change language but you cant change java
 struct: easy choice
 MSmits: eh, it's not a choice
 MSmits: you just gave 1 possibility
 MSmits: well I guess that's why it's easy
 Astrobytes: Is it even worth botboarding the map? Just thinking aloud
 Astrobytes: *bitboarding
 MSmits: yeah it is
 MSmits: it is super easy to keep track of where the opponent can still be that way
 MSmits: very few operations
 MSmits: less code and less actual operations
 Astrobytes: Hm, yeah. 
 MSmits: might be harder to write if you're not used to it though
 MSmits: i shouldnt have said super easy, its really not
 Astrobytes: No not that, just thinking in terms of actual benefit
 dbdr: MSmits stop bragging&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's just convenient
 MSmits: yes, i just realized that sounded like bragging
 dbdr: but I know you're not like that
 MSmits: not intentionally :P
 IAmTheTurtle: concerning ocean of code, i just wrote something to move randomly to valid tiles. Everything was working, i refresh the page, now i'm getting timeout in the first move (after giving the initial position). Anyone else has issues with judge?
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah, go and rub yer lamp :D
 Astrobytes: @MSmits
 MSmits: are you saying I need wishes to beat you?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No. I just know you love it.
 MSmits: guilty
 SmellyPickle: what happens if you try and begin on an island
 struct: you loose
 struct: lose*
 icecream17: Okay, now that I figured out how to move, I now need to keep track of the opponent and... win
 MSmits: 3 step program
 Astrobytes: You insta-lose I think
 MSmits: you do
 icecream17: It's 5:48? I took way too long....
 struct: MSmits after the contest ill share with you the avx knowledge
 struct: is not much
 struct: But now you wont have time anyways
 MSmits: you mean the csb sim?
 struct: yes
 SmellyPickle: can you move and surface in one turn
 Astrobytes: You got it working for the UCT calc struct?
 MSmits: yeah, after is fine. Thanks in advance struct
 struct: Astrobytes I have done the search yet
 struct: I wanted to make a diferent thing
 MSmits: doesnt even need to work perfectly, I just need a half-working example
 struct: for MCTS
 struct: The sim works fine
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: Oh for parallelizing the tree?
 struct: I just dont have search implemented
 MSmits: that's fine really
 MSmits: they are mostly separate anyway
 struct: you will then have an idea how it is at least
 struct: and see that is not that complicated
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: I feel like I missed something here
 emh: seems tough to get into Bronze this time
 struct: what Astrobytes»
 Astrobytes: the special thing you've done with AVX struct
 struct: I havent done anything special
 MSmits: he AVX-ed the CSB sim
 struct: yes I run 8 sims at once
 MSmits: which is a closely guarded secret
 MSmits: but not by struct
 MSmits: because he is awesome
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, I was just wondering if there was some specific thing
 struct: I want to do a different thing for MCTS
 struct: I want to store the stuff of the children in the parent
 Astrobytes: I'm not going near that shit any time soon that's for fucking sure
 struct: instead of in the children
 Astrobytes: woops, delete foul language
 struct: And only allow 8 moves max
 MSmits: you must feel strongly about avx :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm guessing you can't SURFACE and charge a power?
 MSmits: just blame it on the corona Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: So have no children?
 struct: I will have children
 struct: but for children selection
 struct: I wont need to do a for loop
 struct: because everything will be stored in __m256 
 struct: that is in parent
 Astrobytes: Right OK I got ya
 struct: I have no idea if it works
 struct: this is just an idea
 MSmits: hmm there is 1 problem
 Astrobytes: Seems OK in theory
 MSmits: you will store the visit count and wins right?
 MSmits: in this _m256
 struct: yes
 MSmits: but nodes have more information
 struct: Yes multiple problems
 struct: thats why I never did it :p
 MSmits: you lose out on some locality... keep the information of a node close together
 Illedan: emh yeah, bosses are strong&#160;:)
 Illedan: But it's a month
 Astrobytes: Otherwise you start storing nodeID's or soemthing and everythign will be a mess
 Astrobytes: -those spelling errors
 MSmits: something and everything are mostly spelled that way afaik
 MSmits: noone ever types them correctly
 MSmits: like theif
 Astrobytes: treu
 Astrobytes: :P
 Illedan: I'll add:
 Astrobytes: hehe
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 struct: Probably it wont work well
 struct: But I cant think abaout it now
 Astrobytes: Sometimes you have to reinvent Betamax to realise it won't win over VHS struct
 struct: never heard of betamax
 struct: I guess that proves what you are trying to say
 Astrobytes: There's a reason for that :D
 Astrobytes: Oui
 Astrobytes: I mean yes
 struct: Sim?
 Astrobytes: Sim waht?
 Astrobytes: What
 struct: Sim = Yes
 Astrobytes: Ah OK Portuguese
 MSmits: betamax sounds like a failed minimax
 MSmits: I think I wrote many betamax
 struct: I failed less times with MCTS than with minimax
 struct: I mean It was way faster to make MCTS work
 MSmits: well I didnt try so many minimax... usually they work, but they are weak
 dbdr: wow, #3&#160;:)
 dbdr: never started so strong
 MSmits: gj
 Waffle3z: I need more opponents to beat
 dbdr: but top 2-8 is pretty close
 Waffle3z: oh I'm not in first anymore
 Waffle3z: had to refresh
 dbdr: lol
 struct: only if you have waited 30 days
 struct: before refreshing
 MSmits: yay, I inverted the map
 MSmits: x is now . 
 MSmits: . is now x
 MSmits: awesomeness
 SmellyPickle: will map always be 15x15
 mlomb: The range to fire a torpedo is 4 cells manhattan or euclidean?
 MSmits: i hope so SmellyPickle
 MSmits: kinda assuming that now
 emh: yay bronze
 Illedan: hi emh
 Illedan: Long time no see
 emh: hi Illedan
 Illedan: And gratz
 hyphz: Sodding Python making pathfinding slow
 MSmits: grats
 emh: thx&#160;:)
 mlomb: Sorry I meant if the torpedo fires as a 5x5 grid around the torpedo or as a rhomboid
 hyphz: The graphics make it look like it's a 3x3 square
 Illedan: Range is BFS
 Illedan: The damage is 3x3
 dbdr: nice emh
 emh: thx&#160;:)
 mlomb: Ok thx
 emh: second in Bronze (so far) and don't even have bitboard hehe
 struct: if bitboard was requirement for bronze 
 struct: I would quit now
 MSmits: you really dont need it to get anywhere, I just find it convenient :0
 Illedan: Way to early to need bitboards yet :P
 emh: 513 lines. but 2 BFSes. duplicated. and just iterating over possible enemy positions
 emh: ok good night
 MSmits: Got my possible position tracker for opponent working
 MSmits: well in wood 2 that is
 MSmits: and not for surfacing yet, but should be easy to add
 MSmits: off to bed now, gn :0
 SeebOmega: good night 
 SeebOmega: come on i pushed frankh and get stuck before boss
 struct: just wait
 struct: someone will push you
 SeebOmega: About silence distance 0 
 SeebOmega: is someone knows the behaviour&#160;? 
 Scarfield: no movement
 SeebOmega: yes but the cell already visited is no effect i guess
 Scarfield: and you should also be able to only shoot a torpedo without moving for a turn, and surfacing without movement, but im not sure tbh
 Scarfield: idk, hope not&#160;:)
 Illedan: Correct
 Illedan: Why do you hope not?
 Scarfield: because i think it would be a better game if you are able to stay in place for some situations 
 Illedan: You can stay in place
 SeebOmega: but according to the code i stay silenced i f i use 0 
 Illedan: yes
 SeebOmega: and in the UI i look so tiny (silenced)
 Illedan: Yeah, the UI has a bug on that
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Illedan: I failed when updating the sprites .P
 Illedan: You can stand still by doing other commands than MOVE or doing Silence with 0
 SeebOmega: if(i == distance){				player.isSilenced = false;			}
 SeebOmega: is not reachable if distance = 0 
 Illedan: That is only for UI
 Illedan: I tried to ninja hack the Viewer on top of some spagetti code :P
 Illedan: And now I understand why that is a bug in the Viewer :facepalm:
 Scarfield: nice that silence 0 is also a way to stay in place, there seems to be a lot of depth actually, nice game :muscle:
 SeebOmega: need to send PR on the git or it s ok&#160;? 
 ronlobo: In wood league there is a command MSG, but it doesn't say what is being used for.
 SeebOmega: Thx for followingstream i ll try to do another session with new strat and some music 
 ronlobo: just throwing this out here...
 SeebOmega: ronlobo debug message to display 
 Scarfield: to message in the viewer, either for extra debugging, or to taunt your opponent :p
 ronlobo: how to taunt an AI ...
 Astrobytes: Merci pour le stream SEebOmega
 ronlobo: thx&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: add "|MSG message" at the end of your output ronlobo
 lNitsua: for some reason on the new sub game it's giving me each map line twice i think
 lNitsua: I'm not good at C, but I'm basically just using the starting code with an added loop to display the line and it's still doing double lines
 Scarfield: do you cerr twice?
 lNitsua: I feel like an idiot, but what's cerr. I don't use it
 struct: cerr outputs to error stream
 struct: is just so you can debug stuff
 struct: without game referee reading it
 Astrobytes: Don't print to stdout unless it's your moves, use stderr for everything else
 lNitsua: no, i use the fprintf it recommends. But no
 Astrobytes: paste thy code sir
 lNitsua: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/XF3AU5YB">https://pastebin.com/XF3AU5YB</a>
 struct: C recomends printf
 struct: not c++
 lNitsua: it's literally the base code, but with one extra loop to display the map
 lNitsua: it prints the top half but at double height for some reason
 Astrobytes: seems to print 15 x 15 for me?
 lNitsua: it prints 15x15 but it's not correct
 Astrobytes: Ah so I see
 OmidSafari: HI
 lNitsua: it prints each line twice to fit 15x15
 lNitsua: I could just ignore a line each time but I'd like to just know what's wrong
 AntiSquid: messages for orange player aren't centered below the player
 ronlobo: Setting up my Rust env, thanks a bunch to everyone making this puzzle happening!

 PatrickMcGinnisII: darn, 1st submit, stuck in wood 2
 Waffle3z: second time codingame's ide crashed, just lost code
 lNitsua: I just tried doing the exact same thing in java and it worked fine
 OmidSafari: I WANT TO SHARE MY PROGRAM  WAHT I DO IT?
 ronlobo: huh, not developing locally?
 Astrobytes: lNitsua just fprintf(stderr,line); will print the map
 OmidSafari: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1/solution">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1/solution</a>
 Waffle3z: it just crashed again. it keeps crashing
 OmidSafari: PLEASE VOTE
 Waffle3z: as soon as I scroll down too far in the ide the page freezes
 AntiSquid: OmidSafari what are you trying to do
 lNitsua: yeah, but i'm going to parse through each tile like that for my data, so if that doesn't work neither will my code
 Waffle3z: freezes when I scroll down to line 100 and the sidebar width changes
 OmidSafari: I solved this easy solution i want you say you opinion
 AntiSquid: paste your code in chat then
 AntiSquid: or go to results and click share
 lNitsua: Astobytes doing what you said only prints the first 8 lines
 lNitsua: I have never felt so incompetant
 struct: Nitsua i tried and also failed
 struct: in c++ its easier
 lNitsua: I'm trying to learn C tho
 lNitsua: but I guess fuck it
 Astrobytes: Yeah correct lNitsua, my  C is failing me now. I've used C++ for this ... is there soemthing up with the C stub or am I just dumb?
 AntiSquid: there's nothing dumber than toilet-paper-zombies, even regular zombies seem smarter
 lNitsua: that makes me feel better. Using cpp and java i was able to read through the map easily. I also noticed that literally just error printing  new line does it twice
 lNitsua: it may just be something with the I/O we dont' know, but it's kinda sus
 lNitsua: has anyone here done it in C yet?
 Astrobytes: I'm about to go to bed lNitsua but is it something to do with the null terminated strings in C?

 Illedan: yes SmellyPickle
 Illedan: What about that AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: look at the replay, the MSG is cut off since it's displayed at the edge of the screen for orange

 Illedan: Wood 1 :D
 Astrobytes: STB now Illedan?
 Illedan: stb?
 Astrobytes: Straight to bronze
 Illedan: Gimme 10 min I guess
 AntiSquid: so STL = straight to legend&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Quite
 Astrobytes: STB could also be straight to base, but that's quite a different discussion
 Astrobytes: Anyway
 Astrobytes: Time to die

 PatrickMcGinnisII: 'nite.  I quit trying an hour ago.  I should log off
 icecream17: Hour 4: Still trying to beat boss 1
 Waffle3z: what does the wood 2 boss do now? I beat it before it worked
 icecream17: It follows you. Shoots when it can
 Waffle3z: that's what the wood 1 boss does, except with silence
 Illedan: Correct&#160;;)
 icecream17: Does wood 1 even exist...?
 Waffle3z: if wood 2 doesn't use silence then that makes it a bit easier to track down
 icecream17: Oh. Wood 1 is after wood 2...
 icecream17: I've never passed a wood league before. I'm so bad at this.
 Waffle3z: I keep a grid of possible positions and simulate movement on each one every turn
 icecream17: I *think* i'm doing that, but it doesn't seem to work....
 Waffle3z: print out a display of the grid of possible positions every turn, see if it matches what you expect
 icecream17: it doesn't match... doesn't say it deleted anything. but somehow the array length is decreasing by 1 anyway.

 BenjaminUrquhart: oh wait
 BenjaminUrquhart: I read it backwards

 MostComplicatedUsername: Where does it say?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I just figured out how to deduce the enemy's position and I have to go sleep &gt;.&gt;
 MostComplicatedUsername: Have fun?
 newbiecoder: my thing is I don not understand which code is easier or anything
 MostComplicatedUsername: What is easier than what?
 newbiecoder: like which coding system is easier c+ or c# or java javascript? idk
 MostComplicatedUsername: python is easier
 Waffle3z: try python
 newbiecoder: kk
 newbiecoder: I still can't understand I mean I am new to this
 MostComplicatedUsername: Actually basic easiest
 newbiecoder: which is?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Basic
 MostComplicatedUsername: Visual Basic
 MostComplicatedUsername: "VB.NET"
 Waffle3z: BASIC and VB.NET are different
 Waffle3z: also old
 Waffle3z: and probably not easier to learn or use than python
 MostComplicatedUsername: Hm
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh you're right

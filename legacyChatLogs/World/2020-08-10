 kokuou: no, you'll automatically get credit once the round is over
 Putnam3145: so the answer is "yes", but it takes no effort on your part

 Nghia64582: how the fuck
 MSmits: stored solution
 MSmits: if you do hundreds of clashes you see repeats
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see anything suspicious about solving a clash in 2min 35s
 MSmits: oh I saw 2 seconds, did not click
 MSmits: thought they solved it in 2 seconds :P
 maybesmurf: lol
 Memo12334: hacks?
 Lauwie-Timmer: Im a bit confused can anyone pass me a Legends of Code &amp; Magic sample script
 MSmits: are there starter bots for it?
 Lauwie-Timmer: idk
 MSmits: you should probably ask a more specific question 
 MSmits: about what you're confused about
 Lauwie-Timmer: How I get my cards and the opponents cards
 MSmits: you dont get your opponent cards I think, just how many he has. And of course whats on the table
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/LegendsOfCodeAndMagic/blob/master/config/Boss.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/LegendsOfCodeAndMagic/blob/master/config/Boss.java</a>there it is
 MSmits: did you write a bot for a game before Lauwie-Timmer?
 MSmits: cuz locam is a bad place to start
 MSmits: it is complicated, both the input and the game itself
 MSmits: unless of course you're a good coder and just haven't done bots before. Then you could figure it out probably
 Lauwie-Timmer: Oh, yes im pretty new to codingame in general
 Lauwie-Timmer: I did a couple easy puzzles at first
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: bots are a big investment. Can take a few hrs to even get a basic bot going in some cases
 Lauwie-Timmer: Ive only made cryptocurrencty tradingbots but not bots for games
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: well if locam motivates you to keep going it's ok I guess
 MSmits: I'm just saying there are easier games 
 Lauwie-Timmer: Where do you suggest i start
 aCat: hi - yep LOCM is a bad place to start&#160;;]
 MSmits: hmm the website tells you to do coders strike back basically
 MSmits: but there are other options
 Memo12334: but can you solve Lumen
 Lauwie-Timmer: I dont know
 MSmits: if you like board games, just about all of them are easier than locam. Getting a bot working there is easy, but you need a search algorithm for the bot to be any good
 Lauwie-Timmer: Okay Ill check out another game first
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe</a>this one starts with a classic 3x3 tic tac toe
 MSmits: that's true for most simple bot games. The simpler the game, the more likely that you need a robust search algorithm
 aCat: there are some nice not too hardcore things to do like tron, codebusters, fantastic bits
 MSmits: yeah UTTT is great to start with also
 Memo12334: do u guys recommend to do all easy puzzles first?
 aCat: when you don't need a very proper algorithh to do nicely
 MSmits: Memo12334 definitely not all
 aCat: UTTT also
 Memo12334: one should be able to do easy puzzle in ~10 minutes?
 Memo12334: before going to more advanced stuff
 MSmits: Memo12334 I am not able to do that most of the time :P
 <b>**eulerscheZahl hasn't done all easy one and probably won't do</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> Memo12334: oh lol, good to hear ngl
 Memo12334: eulerscheZahl why?
 eulerscheZahl: some are boring
 MSmits: I'm mediocre speed. Many strong players can do them below 10 mins though, including euler
 Memo12334: crazy abstract thinking
 MSmits: I sometimes can do 10 min, usually 15-20 for easy 
 Memo12334: ok if I have done 20 easy then im going to medium
 MSmits: also Memo12334, difficulties arent set in stone. They are very relative
 MSmits: you may find some medium ones really easy
 MSmits: on the other hand, i think marslander 2 is medium, unless they changed that
 eulerscheZahl: you may even want to have a look at the hard ones. and step back to medium if you struggle with hard
 MSmits: it's really *not* medium
 Memo12334: I struggle even with easy ones :S 
 Memo12334: did like 15 or something now but still struggle everytime I begin a new easy challenge
 MSmits: ahh keep going a bit then
 eulerscheZahl: mars lander depends on how you approach it: you can pass with a few simple if-else statementsor you can write a search. the latter isn't easy and the first isn't a generic solution but just passing the given testcases
 MSmits: sometimes they require specific domain knowledge that can make them hard for you
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i did it with heuristics and had great trouble with it
 MSmits: they are hit and miss, guess i didnt find the right ones
 Memo12334: when one is rdy to do the clash of code that's about bots, genetic algos etc
 eulerscheZahl: i tried a search and failed. then solved it with heuristics in about 20min
 MSmits: Memo12334 are you asking when you can do multis?
 eulerscheZahl: after solving all hard ones and most very hard ones before
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Memo12334: ye I just saw this clash of code thing on the main page thats about bots and it got my interest. It goes from bronz to legend. Is that multi
 MSmits: hmm i think you are confused
 MSmits: clash of code is something else
 MSmits: that's basically puzzles that are easier than easy
 MSmits: but you solve them competitively
 MSmits: speed etc.
 MSmits: multiplayer arena's are the bot games
 MSmits: totally different world
 Memo12334: oh it was this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 MSmits: yes thats one of the many bot games
 MSmits: whether or not you're ready for that is kind of hard to say
 Memo12334: awesome stuff
 MSmits: if you want to rank high, then you're not. If you just like to get a bot going and get out of the lower leagues, then you're ok 
 MSmits: some bot games are hard to get going in, like legends of code and magic, that we just discussed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>just give it a try. you can also check out the other games and watch a few replays to see what looks interesting (and easy enough) to you

 eulerscheZahl: that's the link i wanted to share
 Memo12334: yes but tbh I want to get good in easy challenges first. 
 MSmits: sounds good. It's what I did
 MSmits: but don't be afraid to fail against other players. You don't need to be great to compete
 MSmits: it doesn't take that much to beat half the players on the board really
 MSmits: most of submitted bots are simple bots and a few if-else rules might get you halfway up the ladder in some of those games
 MSmits: a few days ago I tried the board game breakthrough and a bot doing random moves got rank 129 out of 163
 MSmits: (not suggesting this game for beginners though)
 Memo12334: yes but u have maths background tho 
 MSmits: that helps in some cases and it useless in others
 MSmits: for example, you can do the game code a la mode, that's about cooking food
 MSmits: math won't help there
 MSmits: also, often you can steal the math required for simulation of the game from the game referee (the source code)
 Memo12334: where is that
 Memo12334: github?
 MSmits: it's linked from the description of the game usually, yeah github
 Memo12334: oh
 MSmits: sometimes it's complicated though, i would not go into the math of coders strike back 
 Memo12334: im trying to get good in easy medium challenge first for sure
 MSmits: it's really extensive. Most of these physics games have some math that'll scare you if you dont have any background in it
 MSmits: but most games aren't physics games
 Memo12334: good to know because I am more motivated to through my maths book now
 Memo12334: go*
 MSmits: Memo12334 the easy puzzles that will help you most are the ones that force you to learn search algorithms
 MSmits: or maybe those are medium mostly
 MSmits: pathfinding and such
 Memo12334: oh I will look for those after I completed Lumen
 MSmits: is lumen the one where you need to output which squares are lit?
 Memo12334: not lit
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: I think i did that one
 Memo12334: the places which givee zero light
 MSmits: when practicing python
 Memo12334: I don't need to do something with recursion right?
 MSmits: recursion is rarely *needed* though sometimes it's useful, for sure not here though
 MSmits: i'll see what i did
 Memo12334: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b0073dae-a6ff-4547-be9d-f59bdee84baf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b0073dae-a6ff-4547-be9d-f59bdee84baf</a>
 Memo12334: got only this till now :S
 MSmits: i did a 4 loop
 MSmits: 4 loops inside eachother
 MSmits: 2 loops to loop over all cells
 Memo12334: ye that's what I got now 
 MSmits: then for each cell, another 2 loops over all cells so i can see if a lamp is close enough
 MSmits: if not, then it's one of the zero light cells
 doompack: i dont understand
 MSmits: my solution is not very efficient
 MSmits: but works
 MSmits: doompack understand what?
 BlackWraith: Anyone know the difference between encode and decode for the Enigma Machine puzzle?  Encode is fine, struggling with Decode.
 Memo12334: yes
 Memo12334: decode is just reverse of encode
 Memo12334: so rotor 3 to 1 and then deceasar
 BlackWraith: Thanks.
 Putnam3145: dang i'm not seeing any other solutions for the weekly
 Putnam3145: guess i'll have to check later??
 jacek: ohai
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 MSmits: hi
 MSmits: hey jacek, I am still trying to get the race patterns to work. Never got access to the paper i found on this, but I figured out something. It still has bugs though
 MSmits: there is one paper that you can access but it doesn't explain much
 MSmits: you need to request access for the other paper I found, but they didnt give me&#160;:(
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/481139584">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/481139584</a>  here's an example. Solves pretty soon, but incorrectly identifies some patterns as winning I think
 jacek: well i have something too, at the very least its easy to solve 1-2 plies before the end
 MSmits: yeah, I had that without patterns
 MSmits: 4-5 plies at best
 Mutant17: hello
 MSmits: unless there are almost no pieces, then i could get 10 or so
 jacek: its quite hard to search for paper for breakthrough
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: all you get is about the ai breakthrough or something
 MSmits: yeah or a breakthrough in medicine  or something :p
 darkhorse64: you can find the "Programming Breakthrough" article on google books. It's incomplete but you get the original evaluation function. 
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: thats the one i requested!
 MSmits: thanks darkhorse64
 MSmits: is the function any good?
 darkhorse64: It has 4 features: piece count, piece value, piece safety, breakthough capability (how many friends or empty squares in  a 2x3 rectangle in front of the piece). I did not  implement that one (paper looks unclear to me)
 darkhorse64: I read you have mobility (similar to the 2x3 rectangle&#160;?) and empty columns
 darkhorse64: and piece count
 jacek: piece safety is quite important. undefended attacked piece is a no-no
 jacek: and of course piece-square table
 MSmits: i dont have that yet
 MSmits: basically I have most things except attack/defend feature
 MSmits: and all my parameters are unfitted
 jacek: have you seen checkers link yesterday?
 MSmits: nope
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php">http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php</a>
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db8cacf0-888d-4f4a-b98c-0dafc2ad9b02">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db8cacf0-888d-4f4a-b98c-0dafc2ad9b02</a>
 MSmits: row max and power basically means 2k points for 7th row (almost win) and quadratic reduction for earlier rows
 MSmits: it fills an array i use for lookups
 darkhorse64: empty what&#160;?
 MSmits: nice one jacek, may help me figure out a way to tune params
 MSmits: empty columns
 MSmits: not sure if that's a good feature
 MSmits: but it's in for now
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37024/Simple-AI-for-the-Game-of-Breakthrough">https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37024/Simple-AI-for-the-Game-of-Breakthrough</a>
 MSmits: I used this to draw features from
 MSmits: its obviously horribly inefficiently implemented there, with loops over pieces instead of bit operations, but the ideas arent bad and got me to rank 14, even without fitting params
 MSmits: generally I tend to pick my params fairly well at first try though
 MSmits: though my piece count value is probably too high
 MSmits: and some of the others too low
 MSmits: the reason i dont have an attack/defend piece thingy yet is because that link implements it very weirdly
 darkhorse64: I remember this one. I have seen your performance figures. You have at least a 2x advantage over my bot. I need to at least backport a few improvements I did on my latest MCTS. My piece count bonus is within the range of my piece squre value
 MSmits: same with me i suppose
 MSmits: max = 2k for square value
 MSmits: i dont do anything magic to get this kind of performance though. The last few games, all I did was find all the features I can think of, slap a param on them and start fitting
 darkhorse64: my range is [2-36]
 MSmits: mine goes 2k -1k-500-225 etc. starting from 7th row back
 MSmits: possibility quadratic is not the best power to use here
 MSmits: thats why i gave it a parameter to fit later
 jacek: and home row?
 Lauwie-Timmer: With tic-tac toe how do I know what field im in
 Lauwie-Timmer: when theres 9 fields
 MSmits: not sure, very low jacek
 MSmits: it's rounded to integers
 MSmits: floored i guess
 jacek: Lauwie-Timmer depends on last move
 jacek: MSmits huh, home row is important
 darkhorse64: Home have highest value than middle row
 MSmits: really
 MSmits: let me add that to my list then&#160;:)
 Lauwie-Timmer: What do you mean with depends on last move
 MSmits: when the opponent plays top right corner, you play top right board next
 MSmits: you decide where your opponent goes
 MSmits: watch a few replays
 jacek: if last move on small board was top right, then you play in top right board
 MSmits: from leaderboard
 darkhorse64: My values are lifted from the Porgramming Breakthrough paper. I guess my move gen is bad. I have three int64 for left, right, forward, did not find a better idea
 darkhorse64: 5, 15, 15,  5,  5, 15, 15,  5, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/103179d2-35fc-4b3f-9bdb-0b0e4417dbf5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/103179d2-35fc-4b3f-9bdb-0b0e4417dbf5</a>
 MSmits: i have the same movegen
 darkhorse64: home row first
 MSmits: inline uint64_t DiagonalLeftMoves(uint64_t board) {	return board &amp; DIAG_LEFT &amp; ~(board &gt;&gt; 7);}
 MSmits: DIAG_LEFT is a mask so as not to go off the board on the side
 MSmits: i dont bother having a row evaluation for the last row because it's a solved state
 MSmits: no need to ever evaluate it
 MSmits: hmm lookups will be slower this way, if you have to loop over all pieces
 MSmits: I have it this way for onitama
 MSmits: but there are very few pieces
 darkhorse64: Looking back at my 9 months old code, I think what sucks is that I build a move [start,end] array from these ints. No alloc there, but still many writes
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e5f9c4c-eda7-4426-b55a-d98c51b60fa4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e5f9c4c-eda7-4426-b55a-d98c51b60fa4</a>
 MSmits: I always do it that way
 MSmits: not sure if it is the fastest way
 darkhorse64: It saves writes at least. It's the drawback of reusing code. I tend to write the engine according to the MCTS interface. In this case, altering the interface is better. I have also a different code path for B &amp; W
 MSmits: ah yeah thats something i was struggling with
 MSmits: I have 1 codepath, but I had to keep both playerboards from their own perspective, their homerows being the smallest indices
 darkhorse64: I gave up early
 MSmits: so everytime i do a movegeneration I reverse the bits of the opposing player
 MSmits: well you already won because you're the creator.
 MSmits: kudos
 darkhorse64: There's an intrinsic for that&#160;? 
 MSmits: no there's not unfortunately
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0d4a037-e2a9-4cdb-824f-e18b07e514c3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0d4a037-e2a9-4cdb-824f-e18b07e514c3</a>
 MSmits: but you do it once per movegen, you're generating some 20 moves and only have to do this once
 eulerscheZahl: that code looks familiar
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah i distilled it off that page you guys shared
 darkhorse64: I am not the game designer. Even though I am a Java noob, it was not too difficult
 MSmits: it was spread out over severall .h files
 eulerscheZahl: he also tried to find the minimum number of operations needed for different lengths
 eulerscheZahl: for 3 bits you can keep the middle one
 Scarfield: why are numbers given as hex and not int, saw that in othello bots as well?
 MSmits: yeah thats why it was spread out
 MSmits: hex is easier, you can imagine a single hex as 4 bits
 MSmits: I know F = 1111
 MSmits: i often use decimal for smaller ones though
 eulerscheZahl: in Java you can do 0b1111 instead of 0xF
 MSmits: you can do it in most languages
 darkhorse64: In C++, too
 eulerscheZahl: in C# too since recently
 eulerscheZahl: wait, C++ has that? how could I miss it?
 MSmits: I used it in c++ i think in ooc
 jacek: c++14 or better
 darkhorse64: Yavalath needs many, many masks. Binary representation helps
 jacek: i use 0b for uttt
 MSmits: Scarfield look for example at this one:
 MSmits: uint64_t DIAG_LEFT = 0x00FEFEFEFEFEFEFE;
 MSmits: FE = one row
 MSmits: FF is a full row
 MSmits: FE is 1 less on the rightmost bit
 Scarfield: ooh yea thats neat
 Scarfield: ty
 MSmits: np
 darkhorse64: CG delivers bitboarding MS
 MSmits: MS?

 Astrobytes: MSc
 MSmits: oh right
 Don.Paul: Hi guys
 MSmits: yeah if you do a lot of board games you get really good at it
 MSmits: and sometimes it helps for contests
 Scarfield: haha of course thats a thing, ty chessstroBytes
 Don.Paul: Can I access past problem's statement from clash of code?
 Astrobytes: no worries Bitfield
 MSmits: does it even show you the name of the problem?
 Don.Paul: I guess not&#160;;(
 MSmits: i couldnt find a way to do it, aside from finding the contributions if you are high enough level
 MSmits: it's to stop you from hardcoding too easily i guess
 MSmits: i mean storing earlier clashes
 Don.Paul: ah, right
 MSmits: you can still do it
 MSmits: it's just more work
 Don.Paul: ok, thank you!
 MSmits: but if you do so many clashes that you're seeing repeats, maybe you should look for funner things to do on CG:)
 Don.Paul: I was trying to find some exercises to use strings
 Don.Paul: I want to show my friends something about string.
 MSmits: ahh plenty of those in the easy puzzle section
 MSmits: maybe do the ascii puzzle?
 MSmits: not sure if that one is suitable for your purposes but it's a string puzzle
 Don.Paul: I can't playing
 Don.Paul: play it*

 DeathBringer666: If I'm not 1st I'll hack every one of you 
 DeathBringer666: I know your IP source code
 jacek: if youre not 1st, will you delete account
 DeathBringer666: ofc
 Astrobytes: Bring it on
 JBM: "IP source code" that's a nice one ^^
 JBM: i'm stealing it
 Astrobytes: Surely deliberate. No one is that foolish.
 JBM: ofc
 Astrobytes: brb, downloading more RAM
 JBM: RAM? i wanna download wine
 JBM: with the usb faucet
 CptComplex: i have a question: can i use the unity engine here?
 JBM: not really
 MSmits: I used it :P
 CptComplex: so i have to code all this vecor bullshit myself?
 MSmits: I used it to create a program off line to hard code zombies validators :P
 MSmits: but generally no, unity is useless
 JBM: you can copy-paste it
 MSmits: CptComplex you dont need vectors much except for some physics games
 CptComplex: i know
 Astrobytes: "Vector bullshit"
 CptComplex: haha sorry
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 CptComplex: i want to do the coders strike back challenge
 MSmits: yeah thats one of the few places where it can be helpful
 CptComplex: so i need vectors
 MSmits: people have shared code for it though
 JBM: just use complex numbers
 MSmits: check the links on the csb page
 CptComplex: hahaha
 JBM: every language has it
 jacek: sqrt(-1)?
 CptComplex: oh o thought it would be a joke with my name
 JBM: now you're dreaming
 JBM: nope, not awake enough for that
 CptComplex: nah i already coded the basic vector stuff a year ago but it would be nice to have the basic funktions
 CptComplex: thank you
 CptComplex: i will use some shared code and do the rest myself
 inoryy: it is a fitting name if you're asking for the whole unity engine to do very basic vector calculations
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: are there languages with vecotr stuff in their basic libraries?
 inoryy: that's like asking for a death star to kill a bug
 JBM: "hey it works"
 MSmits: some bugs need the death star imho
 Astrobytes: hahaha well put
 CptComplex: i mean.. i would also settle with a small vector library
 Astrobytes: Write yourself one, won't take long and you can reuse it
 CptComplex: but i think importing is not possible at all
 MSmits: you cant have different files here
 MSmits: everything goes in 1 file
 MSmits: so you cant add your own library
 Astrobytes: just copy-paste what you need

 Chen: my old paranoid bot from 2 years ago got to 23rd in legend
 Chen: i had a lot of new ideas that i thought would work better
 Chen: but it seems not
 MSmits: ah nice rank
 Chen: ty :D
 Chen: i should probably do some other games at some point
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: sup jacek?
 jacek: nice, about race patterns
 MSmits: I can give you a quick explanation without getting into coding details if you want?
 jacek: i have some 'patterns' as well but probably less robust
 MSmits: we might not be talking about the same thing
 MSmits: patterns is kind of general
 MSmits: your ntuples in othello are patterns too
 jacek: well not patterns, but more like ifs
 MSmits: ah
 jacek: so pawn can go through the defense holes
 MSmits: I do stuff with pext and pdep to extract triangles in front of the piece i just moved
 MSmits: if you only take the piece of the board that can affect your pawn, you can use a lookup array to see if it can be blocked
 MSmits: if you do it when the pawn enters the opponent board (row 4), it is at most 15 cells
 MSmits: so 15 bit
 MSmits: I only use this array if this pawn is closer to the end than any of the opponent pawns because otherwise he would win the race
 MSmits: or *may*
 MSmits: this is not exactly what the paper was talking about, because my racing patters only work for 1 player pawn vs all opponent pawns in front of it. It does not allow for player pawns working together
 MSmits: (though they are allowed to be in the triangle, it just doesnt count as help)
 MSmits: but the paper pretty much failed to generalize their method, so who knows, maybe this is as much as you can do with in CG constraints
 AntiSquid: which paper?
 MSmits: Solving breakthrough with Race Patterns and Job-Level Proof Number Search
 AntiSquid: ok cheers
 AntiSquid: found free legal link:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/%7En/pub/2011/solving.pdf">http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/%7En/pub/2011/solving.pdf</a>google only sent me to paid links lolis this full version 12 pages?
 MSmits: I think so
 MSmits: there is a different paper called programming breakthrough
 MSmits: wait no not that one
 MSmits: there is another one about racing patterns, but its not public
 AntiSquid: then i am lost because the one i linked is closest in title ...
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: i think this is the paper no?
 MSmits: lemme check if i could find it
 MSmits: cant find it now, but I am sure it wasnt just that one paper. 
 MSmits: i requested it  on researchgate, but i cant find pending requests
 MSmits: Using Partial Tablebases in Breakthrough
 jacek: thats for 6x6?
 MSmits: doesnt matter
 MSmits: it's the concept i was interested in
 MSmits: end game tables
 AntiSquid: browsing history ... filter by research gate
 jacek: i bet they just build the upper 3x6 or 4x6 rectangle
 MSmits: probably, but for racing patterns you only need to worry about a wedge shape pattern in front of a pawn, so it's doable on any size
 MSmits: that is if i am not using the concept wrong, it's my own interpretation. They dont explain it all that well
 jacek: like mcts solver eh
 MSmits: well the mcts solver paper is explained fairly well, but it doesnt work for draws and the pseudocode is :poop:
 jacek: good theres no draws in bt
 MSmits: for bt it should be fine yeah
 MSmits: bah I added more features and now my bot is worse
 MSmits: hmm it seems bad when your bot chooses to advance one pawn all the way to the opponent board only to trade it
 MSmits: you waste many turns that way when the opponent only loses a pawn that hasnt advanced much
 MSmits: I guess I am valueing advancement too much
 jacek: if its not supported by anyone, its worthless
 MSmits: yeah
 Andriamanitra: the fuck is going on with the test cases of this puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/49a99e75f2c6c71fc58a418682b4b3c842">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/49a99e75f2c6c71fc58a418682b4b3c842</a>
 Allis: How do  you mean?
 Andriamanitra: try in ide
 Allis: Oh, wow.
 jacek: no stub?
 Andriamanitra: i guess it's all kinds of broken
 Rosener: lol that's weird, I just did what I thought was that one in CoC and it worked fine in there
 Andriamanitra: yeah it worked in game
 Andriamanitra: i only got 75% despite passing the tests so i looked it up to see where i went wrong
 Rosener: you forgot to convert to integer before you sorted descending, right? or did you take another path
 Andriamanitra: i didnt think to remove duplicate primes i think
 Scarfield: its in contributions and not approved, i doubt you had that exact puzzle in coc, but another very similar one
 Andriamanitra: can't tell if that's *the* issue because it doesn't show the validators
 Andriamanitra: it is accepted, it just doesn't show who approved it
 Scarfield: ah true
 eulerscheZahl: that's a really old contribution. from before the moderating system
 jacek: before the System? is this possible?
 eulerscheZahl: before the 3 votes for or against a contribution, there was a set of users who got permission by CG to moderate the puzzles. only 2 approvals needed
 Andriamanitra: myeah it's also some kind of protected, doesn't let me edit it
 eulerscheZahl: you can see some puzzles that got approved with only 2 votes
 Andriamanitra: would be nice to add a visible test with duplicate primes
 eulerscheZahl: and this puzzle is from even before that 2 user vote
 eulerscheZahl: there are some old contributions with obvious flaws (not only CoC, also regular puzzles)
 eulerscheZahl: but no one except G can edit them
 eulerscheZahl: CG that is
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/reverse-polish-notation">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/reverse-polish-notation</a>
 jacek: aww
 eulerscheZahl: the ROL takes an argument how far to ROL
 eulerscheZahl: but it's always ROL by 3
 eulerscheZahl: if you check the contribution itself, it's a dynamic ROL with argument. also the solution from the creator takes that argument into account
 eulerscheZahl: but someone (CG?) edited it after, leaving that useless and confusing argument
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I can edit it :othat seems new
 eulerscheZahl: in the past the edit button of the contribution was disabled
 eulerscheZahl: and the contribution was out of sync with the puzzle visible on the CG website
 eulerscheZahl: and I just realized that I wrote a wall of text. Sorry
 Scarfield: ban&#160;!
 Astrobytes: was gonna say, euler's overly complex answer
 eulerscheZahl: can I ban myself? i'll try with kick
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 inoryy: your case will be reviewed by the golf board at the earliest
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: that's valuable CG history
 eulerscheZahl: you should all attend euler's history class
 Astrobytes: love it, resident historian and biographer
 Astrobytes: they should pay you really
 eulerscheZahl: oh that's fine. I paid myself with a teapot :P
 Astrobytes: lol, you gonna explore that any further?
 eulerscheZahl: probably not
 Astrobytes: good POC regardless
 jacek: Automaton2000 whats the verdict?
 Automaton2000: not that i don't like java
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://frieslandversand.de/teekanne-1-4l-weiss-utah-teapot">https://frieslandversand.de/teekanne-1-4l-weiss-utah-teapot</a>
 eulerscheZahl: too white
 jacek: too racist
 Scarfield: hey hey Mr race pattern :p
 Astrobytes: lol oh dear
 Scarfield: there are other colors, but the site is a bit weird with searching for a brand/type
 Astrobytes: All teapots must be created in the image of their Lord &amp; Master, darkhorse 64
 Scarfield: also my german ist nicht so gut
 Scarfield: yesterday i got a youtube recommendation for a video with the utah teapot, had no idea about the error 418, but learned why euler named the contribution as such
 Astrobytes: that's the teapot protocol RFC right?
 jacek: Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon?

 Astrobytes: Slowfield
 Scarfield: xD
 mudiko: you cant print to check variables sometimes
 mudiko: what else can i do
 mudiko: is there another way to log
 mudiko: in python
 Astrobytes: flush
 Astrobytes: flush stderr that is
 mudiko: ty
 Andriamanitra: on codingame printing to stderr is probably the best you can do, but you should look up pdb and breakpoint()
 Scarfield: for (int genome = turn; genome &lt; popSize; genome++) {for (int gene = turn; gene &lt; geneCount; gene++) { ...
 Scarfield:&#160;:'( genome should start from 0, this took hours to find piwiu
 siobahnv: hey, just joined! Was trying out The Descent in JavaScript and when I tried to console.log an array it just print the first bracket... halp?
 jacek: print to stderr?
 siobahnv: So console.error() instead of console.log()?
 siobahnv: Though stackoverflow is also suggesting this: process.stderr.write()
 siobahnv: oofph, console output didn't like those
 siobahnv: Sweet, console.error() worked!
 siobahnv: Little beginner unfriendly though? or how would one know to use console.error() instead of console.log() for javascript?
 jacek: there are comments
 siobahnv: true, there is in the base code: console.error('Debug messages...'); 
 SpaceNerd111: I just joined also. There is a menu on the left hand side of the screen where you can get hints. The pseudocode given helped me figure out The Descent
 siobahnv: ah fair, I didn't check out the hints&#160;:)
 siobahnv: I'm hoping to get a few friends hooked, but they're beginners and concerned about them getting frustrated... and "feedback" helps a lot I've found when debugging...
 Astrobytes: there's also a custom testcase feature in the puzzles, to aid with debugging
 siobahnv: ++
 Bam9: help pls. what does this mean? [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 Bam9: Is this even a beinners course?
 Bam9: beginners*
 JBM: it isn't
 Bam9: Where can I find the beginners course?
 siobahnv: maybe try the easy stuff? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Bam9: damm those are considered easy? Im frustrated already..&#160;:(
 Bam9: Ill still continue to try
 Bam9: Thank you!
 Fredysred: Try clash of code... its against other players but the tasks there are simpler than the ones from puzzles... at least in my opinion
 siobahnv: the hints mentioned above^^^ might help too?
 siobahnv: I found I needed to google on the side ;P 
 siobahnv: this is a useful site <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">https://www.w3schools.com/</a>
 Bam9: Alright thanks fredy! The hints are confusing other from the psuedocode and reading the solutions to understand.
 siobahnv: fair
 Bam9: oo alright, thanks sio. Ill use it
 CyrusTheCurator: I'm getting so discouraged. Every time I learn a new framework or wrap up a new project I still feel no closer to finally landing a junior job.
 siobahnv: &lt;3
 AntiSquid: that's called training to become a unicorn CyrusTheCurator
 AntiSquid: just focus on one thing instead
 AntiSquid: make a project for yourself
 siobahnv: I find the hunt for a job is much like coding, gotta get used to rejection (and ghosting) similar to buggy code before you land a job or get working code :P 
 AntiSquid: i am saying focus on one thing because you could research a company and apply for one of their junior roles based on what they need and what you know 
 AntiSquid: or just apply for testing code, dull but it's an entry role
 Putnam3145: i am reading my weekly challenge code from 11 hours ago and finding it weirdly galaxy-brained
 Putnam3145: like, my own code?
 Putnam3145: galaxy-brained in the minorly pejorative sense
 Putnam3145: i.e. "might've overcomplicated it"
 siobahnv: :joy:
 Bam9: finding clash of code super hard too. Should i quit trying to learn programming??
 CyrusTheCurator: siobahnv, I like your mentality, hehe
 CyrusTheCurator: Yeah, often I'll find DRYer ways to refactor even recently written code, so I try to spot-check things as I see them
 CyrusTheCurator: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/617fc5e4-307b-46a0-b4db-e4d60328c7ec">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/617fc5e4-307b-46a0-b4db-e4d60328c7ec</a>
 CyrusTheCurator: they totally abstracted my message :I
 Gorbit99: Bam9 programming is a difficult thing, and codingame isn't an easy beginner challenge
 Gorbit99: I'd suggest checking out other options first, ones that actually teach you programming and don't just test your algorithmization skills
 Bam9: oo I see. Alright thanks Gorbit99! Any suggestions for what I can use?
 Gorbit99: my personal practicing site is codesignal, similar to this in theory, less gamified, but it puts you through the very basics
 Gorbit99: of course this after you already have the basics down
 Bam9: alright thanks man
 Gorbit99: programming sadly starts with sitting down and learning a bit, what is the lang you want to learn?
 Bam9: Python
 bpeter: Hey Gorbit
 Gorbit99: I don't know a good tutorial for that one, but I'm sure others have a suggestion
 Gorbit99: Hey bpeter
 Bam9: Oo
 Bam9: What language do you think I should learn?
 Gorbit99: that just depends on what you want to achieve with ti
 Gorbit99: it*
 Rosener: Python is a fine language, stick with it if you're aimless for now
 Rosener: As you learn more about programming in general and other languages, you might find yourself drawn to them for the aims that you're interested in
 Gorbit99: at which point you won't need as much time to learn a new language
 Gorbit99: just like with actual languages
 Gorbit99: but of course, if you already have a goal in mind, it's just natural to select a first language that helps in that goal
 Gorbit99: motivation is key
 Bam9: alright thanks man
 bpeter: python is very good to platforms like CodinGame
 Rosener: especially for CoC since it can be very compact and quick to write
 Rosener: (if you like to do that)
 Gorbit99: then there's ruby&#160;:^)
 bpeter: yes ruby
 bpeter: i use C++, but same i very fast
 Andriamanitra: always a pleasant surprise when you get 100% correct in reverse mode only to find out that passing the validators requires handling extra cases you had no way to know existed
 Andriamanitra: suddenly 100% is 25%
 Iuykza: Ouch.
 Bam9: Can I ask someone for help??
 Iuykza: I can answer as long as it's a Javascript question.
 Bam9: dam its a python question
 Iuykza: Well go ahead anyways, someone might know.
 Gorbit99: Bam9 it's rare that a question is actually language specific
 Bam9: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a6abd17-d010-44d1-af8b-1b6cb0c5c50f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a6abd17-d010-44d1-af8b-1b6cb0c5c50f</a>
 Bam9: so this is a guessing game to learn python for beginners
 Andriamanitra: "never ask to ask, just ask instead" is solid piece of advice
 Gorbit99: ^we have this same "rule" on a discord server even
 Bam9: and im having a syntax error on 
 Bam9: line 9
 Bam9: idk whats wrong
 Andriamanitra: your indentation is off
 Bam9: oo alright lol. noted :D
 Bam9: oo
 Gorbit99: an important thing to mention in these cases is what the error says
 Iuykza: hackerman.jpg
 Gorbit99: just for later reference
 Bam9: o
 Gorbit99: good old python with it's forced indentation, really nice
 Bam9: lol
 Andriamanitra: i would suggest sticking to 4 space indents with python, it's the most common standard and makes it obvious when you're doing things wrong
 Gorbit99: isn't 2 space the most standard:
 Gorbit99:&#160;?
 Andriamanitra: unless you're doing code golf, then 1 space indent is what you want :D
 Andriamanitra: almost no one uses 2 space indents with python, i think google might?
 Andriamanitra: pep is 4 spaces
 Gorbit99: well, tabs are usually 4 spaces and that's what you are imitating with spaces
 Gorbit99: but I really had this notion, that 2 spaces =&gt; python code
 Andriamanitra: ruby is traditionally 2 space indents, maybe you're confusing it with that
 Gorbit99: I'm one of those weird people, who doesn't actually use ruby, just in golf, and I don't see any ruby code ever
 Iuykza: how do we send snippets?
 LBP: git
 LBP: sorry, wrong post
 Gorbit99: if they are long enough, it will be pastebinned
 Gorbit99: so just post them
 Iuykza: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c98a3d20-704e-49ac-b25c-52cb3d8229a1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c98a3d20-704e-49ac-b25c-52cb3d8229a1</a>

 Iuykza: It fails on test 5.
 Iuykza: Which has 1024 players, and I'm not sure how to even debug that.
 Gorbit99: error is in outcomes, S L should be C L
 Gorbit99: had the exact same error myself when I did this
 Iuykza: seriously? :o
 Iuykza: holy jesus you are a god.
 Gorbit99: no, I'm a Gorbit
 Gorbit99: easy to mistake, similar name
 Iuykza: Didn't expect you to be able to understand my code.
 Andriamanitra: how evil of the creator to come up with two things that start with same letter
 Gorbit99: I didn't look at the code, this specific challenge is a hell to get down into a win-lose table
 Gorbit99: well, it wasn't them
 Gorbit99: afaik it was big bang theory
 Iuykza: yep
 Iuykza: I'm surprised my code wasn't that much more complex than the top answer.
 Laminator: always nice when I just barely have enough time to solve a shortest problem, let alone shorten it at all
 Iuykza: Relatable.  I'm not good at those either.
 Gorbit99: it's practice
 Andriamanitra: there are some clashes that i'm sure i couldn't solve in an hour let alone 15 minutes
 SPDene: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6c9a90c2-927b-4ea2-bea0-a180f0c91801">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6c9a90c2-927b-4ea2-bea0-a180f0c91801</a>
 Gorbit99: there's a super hard one
 Gorbit99: pathfinding in 15 minutes
 Iuykza: I was doing a clash with reverse mode.  Thought it was the fobonacci sequence.  Kept failing the tests.  Ended up being something simple:  Math.floor(x * 1.5)
 Andriamanitra: most reverse mode clashes are just stupid
 Andriamanitra: there are some well-designed ones where each test case clues you in a little bit more but they're rare
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just only started clashes cause of the new quest xp
 Gorbit99: oh, pathfinding in 15 minutes doesn't exist anymore
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there is a clash puzzle list w/ descriptions for all of them somewhere
 Iuykza: I don't understand what that one is asking for.  What's pathfinding?
 Gorbit99: I use euler's CG puzzle search
 Gorbit99: pathfinding is when you need to find a path between 2 points given a maze or similar
 Andriamanitra: i remember doing pathfinding through a 3x3 "maze", but that's so small you just code all the possibilities :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: holy crap 706 of them
 Gorbit99: well, this was full on pathfinding
 Gorbit99: I finished it in around 10-12 minutes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Tiramon were u able to do don't panic in under 200 chars in php?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm stuck at 380 chars
 pydlv: I hate reverse
 pydlv: worst mode
 pydlv: dude this puzzle must be broken
 Allis: Which one?
 zile151: personally i don't think any reverse problems are "broken", I just think I waste too much time figuring out the less elegant reverse problems when I could be getting better at coding 
 zile151: just my 2 cents
 pydlv: nvm its not broken Im just stupid and misread the thing. I just though so because no one out of 5 people scored higher than 70%
 Allis: Sites like this really aren't great for getting better at coding. They're good for practicing what you already know, and that has some value.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Allis I have to disagree, there is alot of lazy programming (just look at Microsoft), the tricks to squeezing efficiency in processing and storage are explored in this site.  The application of some really in-depth maths are also used and are perfectly usable in the real world.
 Gorbit99: this site isn't very good for practicing algorithmization, it can be done, but you will be faced with more hurdles than on other ones
 Gorbit99: especially coc, that's terrible for that purpose
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Allis, I'm old, I used to have to program the crap out of a 386 processor to get a decent frame rate.  When the pentiums came out, the added "power" lead to lazy coders.
 StarShip: Do you guys think clash of code is the best resource on this site, or are there any better ones?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, coc ... I never did much of it until today... its not enjoyable to me.  but with 700+ super easy puzzles in it...people can practice...hell need practice.
 StarShip: yeah it usually boils down to keeping you comfortable with your language of choice, and quick thinking, other than that feels mostly trivial
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I enjoy the contests, and I do the puzzles in between.  I've done 100% of the easy ones
 Gorbit99: coc is definitely just like a puzzle, contributions are kept easy enough to do in 5 to 10 minutes
 Gorbit99: it's advertised as giving you a 5 minute break inbetween whatever you're doing
 Gorbit99: of course, the best part is either actually contributing and coming up with your own challenges or competitions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The CP you get from COC goes away, so unless you are doing 100 a day...I don't see much of a point.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, contributions...yup i guess so.  I haven't done any, but I do up/down vote a bunch as they come up
 StarShip: definitely a nice break from other platforms like leetcode lol
 Gorbit99: coc rankings don't go down as quickly as you would think
 Gorbit99: I usually get back in every 2 months or so, grind it to 8th to 10th, and leave it like that for the next 2 months
 Gorbit99: and when I come back I tend to be around the 80th place, with only 10 clashes necessary to get me back to a similar standing
 Allis: I think the decay doesn't even start if you do one a day, no?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my preferred lang. isn't really coc friendly...the ruby/python have an advantage
 Gorbit99: Allis I had days, where I just checked my ranking and it stayed where it was for like a week
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG is making me play it so I can get the easy XP from the quests
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 Gorbit99: well, that's easily solvable, once you have them done :P
 Gorbit99: the most difficult coc quests are definitely the last 3
 PatrickMcGinnisII: current quest is 50 clashes..I've done 19 ... and i suck
 Gorbit99: doesn't matter
 Gorbit99: I definitely sucked, if not even more, when I was at 19
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the code golf quests are impossible in php
 Gorbit99: it's not even about winning at that point, it's about getting to know your language
 Gorbit99: I learned what I know in ruby basically entirely on this site
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't like sloppy code,  I have a tendancy to not use optimal methods when I'm in a hurry and I don't evaluate error_logs and such.
 Gorbit99: well, then coc isn't for you
 Gorbit99: it's about sloppy hacks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, coc isn't for me.  I can do it, but I like testing my code more
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, hungry..gotta cook.  glhf.

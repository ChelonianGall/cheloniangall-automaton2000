 jrke: oh lemme see
 Jaek: thank you
 Jaek: for now its almost 6am.. please leave your feedback and ill reply to it tomorrow
 jrke: ah np
 jacek: good morning
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: morning:sleeping:
 AntiSquid: hi
 dbdr: hey
 JayDe: Has anyone ever had the problem that their Language Assist did not load/activate? I already tried to reload the page - but unfortunately it did not work. 
 jacek: real programmers need no assist
 Marchete: yeah, real programmers never use stackoverflow
 [CG]Thibaud: what language JayDe&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: it was reported to us before but we haven't be able to reproduce it
 [CG]Thibaud: any error in the browser console&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: does it happen on any puzzle/coc/multi?
 JayDe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e4201d2-8fd2-4a3a-b12e-4eeb7eafedef">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7e4201d2-8fd2-4a3a-b12e-4eeb7eafedef</a>
 [CG]Thibaud: interesting thanks
 [CG]Thibaud: damn still can't reproduce
 [CG]Thibaud: so the tooltip shows "activating C# language assist" indefintely JayDe&#160;?
 blasterpoard: [CG]Thibaud got the same problem, console says:at app.26fad693.js:162 "Possibly unhandled rejection: {}"
 JayDe: yes
 blasterpoard: also
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74f2e13c-e35f-47f3-864c-0d57c681605d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74f2e13c-e35f-47f3-864c-0d57c681605d</a>
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah this error is not helping apparently&#160;:(
 [CG]Thibaud: what browser do you use?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: ie
 blasterpoard: chrome here; it happens even with extensions turned off
 [CG]Thibaud: and you reproduce this on any puzzle&#160;?
 blasterpoard: looks like yes
 JayDe: Firefox. Tried turning off extensions as well as deleting browsers cache + cookies but it's still not working.
 [CG]Thibaud: tried with a different account, still no bug :thinking_face:
 [CG]Thibaud: it takes like 10s to activate but it eventually works
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't get it
 MadKnight: JayDe check f12
 JayDe: I have checked it already
 JayDe: It just says&#160;:  "Couldn't start client CodinGame csharp Language Client"
 JayDe: Defenitely seems to be a bug with C# because all other languages work.
 [CG]Thibaud: another member reported having the issue with Rust
 jacek: phew, rust isnt priority
 MadKnight: not that one JayDe
 jrke: bicklil you are defeating gold boss just by your silver bot
 jrke: in game of drones
 bicklil: yeap 
 MadKnight: because why not&#160;?
 jrke: whats your strategy

 jrke: why he had given his code?
 WINWINWIN: Hi MadKnight, awesome to see you back.
 jrke: hey Winwinwin ,awesome to see you back :stuck_out_tongue:
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 MadKnight: long time WINWINWIN
 MadKnight: now only MANMANMAN is missing
 jrke: struct is also missing
 MadKnight: struct is at least online in discord
 jrke: oh i didn't noticed
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 jacek: but not here
 codeing: what's app jrke&#160;?
 jrke: nice
 codeing: don't doing homeworks today&#160;?
 jrke: nope :blush:
 codeing: oki 
 HarryCho: helo
 Lafihalas: Hey guys, any one know if you can choose to fight a specific person in those bot making games&#160;? (not to abuse the rank but to challenge a friend)
 Lafihalas: anyone*
 Marchete: you can remove the enemy and add a player
 Marchete: that player must be on your league or lower
 Lafihalas: y that makes sense, thanks a lot
 DomiKo: lvl 30 :D
 dbdr: grats DomiKo
 wlesavo: dbdr do you remember if robo was active in NS or joined recently? somebody improved and i cant figure out who
 eulerscheZahl: congrats DomiKo
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/optim/number-shifting.tsv">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/optim/number-shifting.tsv</a>
 wlesavo: DomiKo grats, also got 30 by finishing roadmap
 eulerscheZahl: check the history
 dbdr: blame
 eulerscheZahl: even better
 dbdr: robo improved last 6 months ago
 eulerscheZahl: #7 is rather new
 eulerscheZahl: the unnamed player
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl oh, thx
 wlesavo: yeah, the unnamed one
 eulerscheZahl: who even improved to #4 since
 dbdr: it's not mandatory to pick a username?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 dbdr: ah yeah, I think it's an achievement
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you can leave it blank like the avatar
 dbdr: or you can chose your name to be UnnamedCodinGamer
 eulerscheZahl: caused some crashes when i was scraping parts of the website :D
 dbdr: yeah, happy to see it's not my script that's wrong
 dbdr: quite strong to have a lvl2 #4 at NS, no?
 dbdr: *strange
 wlesavo: probably joined soecifically for ns
 jacek: or alt
 dbdr: the world famous challenge
 eulerscheZahl: it's a Japanese player, maybe we find answers on twitter :D
 jacek: just as i at first got legend into uttt, then later looked around the site
 wlesavo: well if he is actually Japanese i would not be much surprised 
 dbdr: search for ナンバーシフト
 wlesavo: dbdr maybe illedan finished the app and left the credit for cg in description :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: good point: Illedan finish the app!how else am I supposed to become rich?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, why didn't you call it Zahlenverschiebung?
 dbdr: much more exotic
 eulerscheZahl: because most users already struggle to pronounce my nickname
 eulerscheZahl: Zahlenverschiebung (or Zahlenverschieben) would have even more letters
 dbdr: Zahlenverschiebungsspiel
 eulerscheZahl: you are making it worse
 wlesavo: двигайчисла
 dbdr: Zahlenverschiebungoptimierungsspiel
 eulerscheZahl: that's something for the eye doctor to print out and hang on the wall
 eulerscheZahl: "try to read the last line"
 kamiathe: hie all
 dbdr: next, we need a game with rhubarb, barbarians and a bar
 dbdr: probably a mod of vindinium would work
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBYr28e0JZo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBYr28e0JZo</a>
 dbdr: yeah, that one&#160;:)
 dbdr: I like how once in a while a few other words make it in the mix
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 dbdr: Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo is nice, but lacking that contrast
 eulerscheZahl: Mox Cicero ad forum orationem habebit. Eo eo eo eo eo libenter.
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl discord
 eulerscheZahl: huh
 dbdr: google translate fails on this one :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's latin
 dbdr: and on the buffalo. what a primitive technology
 dbdr: oh really?
 eulerscheZahl: soon cicero will give a speach on the forum. that's why I go there with him with even more pleasure
 eulerscheZahl: Eo has a ton of meanings :D
 dbdr: google at least got the language detection right
 dbdr: dbdr too&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: Wenn Fliegen hinter Fliegen fliegen, fliegen Fliegen Fliegen nach
 dbdr: why is hinter before the word but nach after it?
 dbdr: s/word/noun/
 eulerscheZahl: you could also say "hinterher" instead of "nach"
 eulerscheZahl: hinterherfliegen/nachfliegen =&gt; part of the verb
 dbdr: but less commonly used word&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: hinter =&gt; preposition
 dbdr: aha
 MadKnight: dbdr have u tried using smitsi&#160;?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: aaayyyyyy german
 dbdr: MadKnight: no
 AntiSquid: you mean why does the grammar look strange dbdr&#160;?
 Solacefire: Beat a Python coder in clash using C#, achieved the impossible
 dbdr: no, I know that part already&#160;:)
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: u talking bout german grammer arent you
 eulerscheZahl: yes we are
 AntiSquid: not really, you just need to solve 1 single clash, save the solution locally then play clash until you get the same solution again and instant paste it for instant win, you beat every language with any other language you want Solacefire
 dbdr: it's a foreign language, the grammar *should* look strange
 eulerscheZahl: just the usual nonsense. wait for Smits to get online and it will be about complicated algos again
 dbdr: it's the language of strangers I should say
 Solacefire: Oh. Well, I did it legit, what's the point otherwise
 AntiSquid: it will be msd9126 holding a monologue
 AntiSquid: Msmits *
 dbdr: poor msd
 AntiSquid: there is no point either way, you clash points decay Solacefire
 Solacefire: The points just gamify it, they're not the point either
 MadKnight: lol eulerscheZahl i didn't quite understand u, did u understand me wrong maybe? i agreed with u and u were like i didn't
 eulerscheZahl: me: switches tabsdiscord: ping, ping, ping...
 eulerscheZahl: me: closes tab
 MadKnight: discord ping: okay cya
 eulerscheZahl: and then a red line on the CG chat
 MadKnight: discord ping (#2 which is last one): we'll talk later then
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i'll just close this tab too
 MadKnight: no need
 MadKnight: that's all i wanted to say
 MadKnight: right Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i know it's not a lot of space

 AntiSquid: can only access through that link, weird
 MadKnight: what are those hackatons like&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i don't know what this one is like, their contests are all different from what i could notice
 MadKnight: AntiSquid why do u think euler got so much annoyed?
 AntiSquid: about what?
 MadKnight: - ask in world, i'm not up for that right now- okay cya; we'll talk later then- "you won, I'll just close the tab"
 AntiSquid: idk, maybe he is busy?
 AntiSquid: what did you ping him about?
 MadKnight: but i didn't push 
 MadKnight: after he said he's not up for that i just send 2 pings saying cya and later
 MadKnight: i can PM u more in discord
 AntiSquid: only if it's cereal
 MadKnight: it's not morning for a cereal
 MadKnight: u need something different
 AntiSquid: is there something specific you wanted to talk about with him?
 MadKnight: yea about MCTS
 MadKnight: or smitsi
 MadKnight: or DUCT
 jacek: tape?
 AntiSquid: what game are you coding for MadKnight&#160;? or is it something outside CG?
 MadKnight: no i'm trying out this DUCT
 MadKnight: on a game where i had everything the most ready to try out DUCT
 AntiSquid: also why not wait for msmits&#160;? he enjoys talking about that 
 MadKnight: where i would have to code the least stuff aside from DUCT
 MadKnight: it was CSB
 AntiSquid: or sign up for one of his physics classes and ask him questions there
 MadKnight: but that's not physics related
 AntiSquid: make it sound like it is then, wording matters
 MadKnight: a guy who is learning english right now is saying that -ing doesn't have any sound for g at all and sounds exactly like -in
 JBM: in some dialects
 AntiSquid: king
 AntiSquid: if you pronounce it as kin ....
 JBM: yay for context
 AntiSquid: i am quite sure i heard a lot of native speakers pronounce the G in ing, many don't
 JBM: and even pronounced, there are multiple ways to do so
 GunMan270: can someone help me to code
 jacek: ohai
 AntiSquid: nah too hard, we are here just for chat GunMan270
 AntiSquid: GunMan270 code what? ...
 GunMan270: python
 GunMan270: python
 AntiSquid: to do what?
 GunMan270: I couldn't see myself type
 GunMan270: just Python in general
 AntiSquid: so you want someone to come over at your home to do pair programming or do you want to do mob programming?
 AntiSquid: not sure what you want to do, but just do it? 
 GunMan270: I don't know I might just do something else like play games because this isn't an assignment I'm just here to pass time
 AntiSquid: all the help you need:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm</a>
 GunMan270: oh thanks
 AntiSquid: this is playing games though
 WhiteGlove: May someone give me a hand with the happy numbers being way out of Java's limit?
 eulerscheZahl: it's well within. you just have to find a better way than checking each number individually
 WhiteGlove: yep, I will check how long the String is before converting to BigInteger
 WhiteGlove: hallo Euler btw&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 JBM: or just do away with the conversion lltogether
 WhiteGlove: but BigInteger uses a lot of resources
 eulerscheZahl: you don't need BigInteger
 WhiteGlove: I would have finished already xD
 WhiteGlove: :O?
 eulerscheZahl: the number fit well within long
 WhiteGlove: so far I solved till 04 which fails
 eulerscheZahl: the main concern is the time consumption
 WhiteGlove:&#160;:/ It does not
 eulerscheZahl: do you get a wrong answer or timeout?
 WhiteGlove: NumberFormatException
 WhiteGlove: I'm on Java
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's ok to paste your code here
 WhiteGlove: It's going to be the "updated" version of it (working with the BigInteger)

 WhiteGlove: Not going to touch expert for now haha
 JBM: your loss
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair the titles are similar :D
 WhiteGlove: JBM, gotta finish the easy first
 JBM: especially if you're german, dare i add
 WhiteGlove: Ich bin kein Deustcher&#160;:)
 JBM: your loss
 WhiteGlove: hahahaha
 JBM: :P
 WhiteGlove: btw, I solved yours mate. I went with recursion
 JBM: which mine?
 eulerscheZahl: Goro
 WhiteGlove: I tried to somehow "overengineer" the problem but recursion was the best approach
 WhiteGlove: bulk email
 JBM: ah yes
 JBM: recursion?
 JBM: err... why not
 JBM: oh wait, did i put recursive expansions in?
 JBM: it's been a long time
 eulerscheZahl: WhiteGlove your BigInteger function has no loop for each digit like the other function has
 WhiteGlove: Yeah, cause I'm still testing it
 eulerscheZahl: also: as you can treat each digit individually, you can keep it as a string and don't even have to parse it as a number
 WhiteGlove: I'm having a stupid error right now... the "x" is not found
 WhiteGlove: say what?
 eulerscheZahl: you want to parse that lengthy string as a number and then extract each digit of compute the sum of squares
 WhiteGlove: The code is from a year ago, I knew I had it half done so now I'm patching it
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i won't judge such old code then.
 WhiteGlove: you mena... split it in two and the sqaure both then sum?
 eulerscheZahl: WhiteGlove 04:27PMMay someone give me a hand with the happy numbers being way out of Java's limit?eulerscheZahl  05:19PMit's well within. you just have to find a better way than checking each number individually
 eulerscheZahl: this is still true despite be confusing puzzle titles
 eulerscheZahl: so that's all i'll say for now, keep trying&#160;;)
 WhiteGlove: yep
 WhiteGlove: vielen Danke

 WhiteGlove: I love that channel
 AntiSquid: watch the cat part 
 AntiSquid: it's holding the paper with paws
 WhiteGlove: AI will exterminate humanity but not cats, confirmed
 AntiSquid: don't see why AI would do that 
 WhiteGlove: not the paw but very interesting it also put text on the book
 JBM: *gets out battery*
 JBM: for THIS
 AntiSquid: that wasn't destruction
 AntiSquid: more like a virtual zoo with humans in it
 JBM: yeah but i forgot the terminator plot
 JBM: they probably had a good reason
 AntiSquid: don't watch the sequels it's stupid and imo it was never explained why skynet would just destroy
 JBM: probably a bug
 JBM: that would never happen in real life
 JBM: Never
 AntiSquid: it achived human level reasoning and conciousness but didn't manage to understand all the benefits of controlling and exploiting the sheeplet, i mean masses instead of exterminating them? really? 
 JBM: your mistake is calling it "human level" when it obviously works differently
 WhiteGlove: It's so impressive how it finished the bird's pic
 AntiSquid: it would rob your grandma her pension not kill her, i am sure
 WhiteGlove: even reflection... 
 AntiSquid: i mean skynet
 WhiteGlove: btw, any of you both are Java bois?
 AntiSquid: no soy, no java, no smoking, no alcohol, i am clean
 WhiteGlove: I you, by any chance, have a JAva reflection example for a .jar file that would be awesome. I read about it and it's quite bonkers
 AntiSquid: except for fermented soy
 WhiteGlove: I see Java on your description... not so clean after all
 jacek: thats image generation looks like my subconsciousness creating scenery in lucid dreams
 WhiteGlove: good point
 AntiSquid: back when i was younger i've done some questionable stuff i guess WhiteGlove
 jacek: and what do you want with reflection in java
 WhiteGlove: HAHAHAHAHA
 WhiteGlove: I was looking for an example of reflection ona .jar file
 WhiteGlove: to get the methods and use them
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/i-told-him-i-cant-open-the-jar-he-said-download-and-install-java.jpg">https://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/i-told-him-i-cant-open-the-jar-he-said-download-and-install-java.jpg</a>
 WhiteGlove: +1 love it
 WhiteGlove: I knew that girl was into me when she actually downloaded Java to test my game
 WhiteGlove: tbh, I don't how what I was high on to wrote that code... fucks shake
 eulerscheZahl: you can open a jar with pretty much any archive manager as it's just a zip
 WhiteGlove: yeah but access the methods from outside?
 eulerscheZahl: reflection is the way to go
 eulerscheZahl: stackoverflow will guide you when you have a more specific question
 eulerscheZahl: in case i was sounding rude: sorry, i would have to look it up myself as well
 WhiteGlove: no worries, I'm fully on the practice tho
 WhiteGlove: I starting to believe that I got it right by mistake a year ago&#160;:/
 KareemTheDream: what are the codes to the codes of clash 
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like a sentence written by Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think he can do it&#160;:)
 xzxy: how to enable dark mode for this site
 eulerscheZahl: there's only a dark mode for the IDE, not the whole site
 eulerscheZahl: in the IDE: settings on the left =&gt; dark side
 xzxy: i need for the wholeeee
 xzxy: is it not possible
 eulerscheZahl: search for a browser extension or whatever
 eulerscheZahl: not supported by CG
 xzxy: my extension doesnt work for this site
 xzxy: ok nvm thanks
 Hazel20: Hi everybody!
 jacek: good evening
 Bobbadillio: Anyone know what the process looks like to ask for language updates? I put in a question on the languages update thread but I have no idea what to expect! 
 jacek: maybe try telling this on discord
 jacek: and whats with rust being popular now
 eulerscheZahl: Bobbadillio update an existing language or get a new one added?
 eulerscheZahl: discord is the wrong channel for this IMO

 eulerscheZahl: yes. some did already&#160;:)
 Andriamanitra: there are multiple very similar puzzles already
 Jaek: Well... thanks for the feed back
 Andriamanitra: props for having good test cases though
 norbi97: I will check it in a sec.. read it already yesterday and liked it
 Jaek: Oh thanks &lt;3
 Jaek: I randomly generated test cases because i wanted big inputs
 Jaek: That way its better and easier
 Andriamanitra: i'm so done with these reverse mode clashes with only about 4 visible test cases
 Andriamanitra: it should be illegal to make reverse mode without at least 8 tests
 Andriamanitra: 100% when testing every single time and anywhere from 0 to 80 when actually submitting&#160;:)
 Jaek: That what happen when they don't cover every case
 Andriamanitra: it's not even that, there are just infinite number of different patterns that work for the given test cases but not for the hidden ones
 Jaek: Yeah that what i meant they dont cover every one of them
 Jaek: But that depends on the difficulty sometimes you dont need more than one test case
 MadKnight: is the server lagging or just my internet&#160;?
 JBM: both
 MadKnight: rip
 Bobbadillio: @eulerscheZahl, I put a question in on the update thread so if that's the appropriate channel I'm probably in good shape!
 Jaek: Is the clash of code region based&#160;? because i've been playing with the same people for a long time
 Bobbadillio: @jacek, I'm a big Rust fan and might be able to explain SOME of the popularity. I came to Rust as a data scientist with python as a main language, and a bit of Java/Scala/R where necessary.
 itzblinkzy: @CopperFr is it find if you share your code? That problem got me really confused.
 itzblinkzy: :pensive:
 Bobbadillio: A lot of stuff in Python is C/C++/Fortran under the hood though, and if you want your code to run fast you have to use those libraries and can't really roll your own stuff
 Bobbadillio: if you want to contribute to those fast libraries, you have to learn a new language that's VERY different from python.
 Bobbadillio: I had a LITTLE bit of exposure to C/Fortran in my past, so maybe I could pick those up, but writing code that's both correct and fast is REALLY hard coming from that python background where you get access to a lot of conveniences that aren't in C/Fortran
 Bobbadillio: Further, I've found the build tools to be impossible to navigate. I like make just fine, but I basically never got an open source C/C++ program to compile correctly in make/cmake/bazel without a LOT of fiddling due to a lack of familiarity with what I'm supposed to do when
 inoryy: look into Julia
 Bobbadillio: Enter Rust: it's a compiled language with a really great build system that feels similar to pip (if not better, because pip/conda/virtualenv all step on eachothers' toes sometimes), and I have access to things that feel surprisingly a LOT like python
 Bobbadillio: I've got iterators, I've got hashmaps, and the main cost I have to pay is dealing with the compiler. That CAN be hard, because Rust introduces this concept of lifetimes and makes you deal with them (more or less), but those compiler checked lifetimes are things you would have to deal with ANYWAY in C/C++ code, and as a python developer without a senior C/C++ programmer checking my work, I'm definitely going to mess stuff up and not know about it.
 Bobbadillio: Julia is cool! I looked into Julia relatively early, sometime in 2012-2014 I think, but I actually couldn't get it to run on Ubuntu 12.04 because I had to use some combination of make/autoconf/cmake, I don't even remember
 Bobbadillio: The point is, I bounced off of Julia and never went back, and probably owe it another look!
 Bobbadillio: Gotta run, but I might check back in later&#160;:)
 Lorzus: Hi all, not sure if this is the place to ask but is anyone having trouble " Activating C# Language Assist" I've gotten this on the FF,Chrome, and Edge and on two separate computers and it just shows a spinning circle. This is on multiple puzzles too. 
 BenjaminUrquhart: imagine having language assist
 Lorzus: Not sure I follow&#160;:) I know it was working when I signed up a week ago or so but somewhere along the line it stopped
 Yatech: Yes, C# language assist is not working currently
 Lorzus: Good to know, thank you @Yatech. I'll hope they get it fixed
 jacek: it works, just people can't C#
 eulerscheZahl: offline IDE ftw
 Lorzus: Yeah I've been using VS to code and then pasting it in to run but it's kind of annoying. NBD though it's definitely workable
 FrankR: Is there any information on these "Unlocked certifications" thingy available?
 eulerscheZahl: do the quest map to unlock them
 eulerscheZahl: you have to click their to claim your quests
 Static.lee: heyy everyone im kinda new here and im doing the Python tutorial and im kinda struggling with finding out how everything is laid out.  please help
 FrankR: ah.. the hats on the quest map.. didn't see those at first. Thanks
 AntiSquid: Static.lee be more specific, exactly what are you struggling with? 
 WhiteGlove: Still with the god damn happy number for big numbers&#160;:(

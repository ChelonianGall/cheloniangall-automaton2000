 Salted: Can someone help me understand some ruby? I'm new to the language. 
 Salted: Would anyone like to, I mean. 
 Salted: In python 
 Salted: y = [3 if i == 'a' else 1 for i in 'aba']
 Salted: How do I do the same in ruby?
 Salted: I tried 'abc'.map do |x|  but I'm not sure that's the right way to do this
 Crafterz125: Im Java,sorry
 Salted: No worries! 
 Megha.Akash: Salted you can do thisy='abc'.chars.map{|x|x[?a]?3:1}
 Salted: oh nice! 
 Salted: Thanks! You really are awesome at ruby. 
 Megha.Akash: Thanks Salted&#160;:)
 VizGhar: .chars? wow&#160;:) I've used .split(<i>) until now</i>
 Vigasaurus: yeah ruby is absolutely silly for shortest
 sirhc001: hey everyone&#160;!
 Salted: hi
 sirhc001: hows it going?
 Salted: Just struggling to learning new things. You?
 z64555: Anybody know the API used to do custom draws on the screen? Some of the CSB runs have their bots drawing where their targets are
 DaNinja: turn on Debug with the cog wheel
 z64555: so its just specific to CSB then
 DaNinja: yes
 z64555: welp

 jacek: good morning
 jacek: sci-hub not working? :c
 wlesavo: jacek use this mirror <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sci-hub.do/">https://sci-hub.do/</a>
 jacek: the site itself works, but errors when you put some link
 wlesavo: oh i see
 Astrobytes: yeah, same. Donno what's up with it.
 jacek: and im not gonna pay for paper like msmits
 Westicles: ooh, that looks shady
 wlesavo: jacek which paper btw
 jacek: i try this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303760000_Scan_wins_draughts_tournament">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303760000_Scan_wins_draughts_tournament</a>
 Astrobytes: try googling it, you can sometimes find pdfs just sitting there, even when another site wants to make you pay
 wlesavo: jacek works for me just by doi in scihub
 Astrobytes: confirmed
 wlesavo: and it is just some weird thesesis for a conference, not worth looking into
 jacek: oh?
 jacek: its 1 page
 wlesavo: yeah, not a paper
 jacek: and they want $$$ for this
 jacek: :unamused:
 Westicles: Wow, I would have figured academic types would be against that.  What if you write a book?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hadn't Sci-hub been killed by a massive provider embargo?
 jacek: well its from that jounral 10.3233/ICG-2015-38401
 wlesavo: Westicles well against paying or against scihub?
 Westicles: Against intellectual property theft
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: lel
 wlesavo: nah, most people are for free access, you dont get any money for youre paper anyway
 Astrobytes: Yep. Journals are mostly a disgrace.
 wlesavo: and you pay around 1k$ for publishing in good open access journakls like nature or scirep
 Astrobytes: Lots of researchers now publish in other places so as to keep the papers available.
 BlaiseEbuth: A real mafia...
 Astrobytes: Yes wlesavo, for no real benefit other than theirs. 
 Westicles: What about books?
 Astrobytes: Don't think you get books on scihub
 Astrobytes: I mean, when you need a book you buy it.
 wlesavo: usually you wont sell anything also, very narrow range of people is interested, and you will give them your book anyway. and yeah, almost no books on scihub, you have genlib for that
 Westicles: oh, there a separate site for stealing books :P
 Westicles: And people wonder why nobody makes new music
 Astrobytes: Meh. I always prefer real books. Can't do more than a few pages of a pdf.
 Astrobytes: Also, books smell nice.
 Westicles: I gave my nephew a copy of the Feynman lectures, and he looked at me like I was crazy
 Astrobytes: Kids really don't do books now?
 Westicles: Not so much
 jacek: :c
 philRG: there is one thing to read books, the other think is to understand what is inside
 BlaiseEbuth: words&#160;? pages&#160;? chapters&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 Uljahn: i guess that's what you get for developing a 'clip thinking' when a book doesn't fit your attention span :shrug:
 Website_Display_Name: yep, my attention span is about 5 minutes lol
 Passifi: mine has dipped a lot too in the last year, but it tends too bounce back when I force myself through some old media books movies games the ability to take it slow comes back&#160;:)
 Passifi: however I wonder whether that is true if you never had that ability to begin with...
 Website_Display_Name: first time ive been on this site
 Website_Display_Name: but some of the question prompts are confusing as hell to understand compared to hackerrank
 Uljahn: overcoming the confusion could be seen as a good practice&#160;:)
 Passifi: I think understanding the problem is the most important part of solving it&#160;:)
 Uljahn: i guess some puzzles were originally written in french and then translated to english, which could add to the confusion :slight_smile:
 Passifi: is this site originally a french enterprise&#160;? 
 Uljahn: yep
 Westicles: Thankfully the world will eventually just speak English, so these things will be cleared up
 Uljahn: or chinese :smirk:
 Passifi: There is plenty of potential to misunderstand things in English think of a program that is supposed to add sell you chips&#160;:) 
 Passifi: All the world spoke french in the past just to come full circle and that didn't go anywhere for the french either&#160;;)
 souta_1326: Is there a limit to the number of bytes in a test case?
 Uljahn: are you making a contribution?
 souta_1326: yes
 Uljahn: from discord: "we've increased the max limit of a contribution statement from 3k to 5k characters"
 Uljahn: i guess it includes testcases
 souta_1326: okay

 tobakudan: I'm trying the rod cutting problem, this week's community puzzle, in Python. Solved all but the last test case, which times out. My solution looks clean and I can't find any way to optimize it. Would love if someone could help me see my blind spot
 tobakudan: Here's the code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/FRyfZGCp">https://pastebin.com/FRyfZGCp</a>
 MaxoozX: Hi tobakudan, I'm currently experimenting the same issue, some people told me to look at the labels of the puzzle
 tobakudan: The labels? I excluded the lengths that are greater than the length of the whole rod, if that's what you're referring to
 Westicles: I think he means memoization and DP
 jacek: you need something smarter than bruteforce
 jacek: maybe even... math
 wlesavo: how dare you
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what is the point in having marketable pieces longer than the rod itself in the input?
 wlesavo: Westicles just noticed, your xp got nerfed?
 Westicles: I donated it to the french foreign legion
 Westicles: UnnamedCodinGamer, no point
 derp22: Interesting, failed the last 2 test cases of the weekly challenge but got 100% on the scored ones
 tobakudan: It's not brute force. Already tried memoization, but switched to a non-recursive solution that's faster
 Abdulrahman_98: hello world
 salmon: You may ignore lengths with price "0". With this improvement my solution in dart passed all tests using recursive algorithm. 
 tobakudan: Yup, already did that too
 VizGhar: Westicles likes himself too much, that's why XP shrink<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/self-upvote-xp-is-gone/188663">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/self-upvote-xp-is-gone/188663</a>

 jacek: number of capital letters
 wolf12345678910: hi
 Angecide: I thought I was losing my mind lol, so I made some performance improvement with pdep instruction and my code got much slower, but it turns out that the zen2 cpu on my machine handles the instruction really badly
 Angecide: but the code is actually almost 70% faster in codingame
 Angecide: like in numer of mcts iterations
 Angecide: *number
 Angecide: which makes profiling code weird, since something can be slow on my machine, but very fast in codingames
 struct: Had no idea zen2 instructions were that much slower
 eulerscheZahl: you should have known, a Zen garden takes a lot of time as well
 struct: zen2: "300 cycle latency250 cycles per 1 clock"
 struct: zen3: "3 cycle latency1 per clock"
 struct: for pdep/pext
 Angecide: ye makes me wanna throw my cpu in the garbage
 struct: remove the per clock on the first
 Angecide: i think the instructions are also really fast on intel cpus
 struct: I think zen 3 matched them
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16214/amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested/6">https://www.anandtech.com/show/16214/amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested/6</a>
 Angecide: ah I see
 darkhorse64: If you buy a fresh cpu, you will experiment the reverse situation: fast on your PC, slow in CG. I have written avx code for a bot that does not run faster than the equivalent scalar code. On my machine, I nearly doubled the overall performance
 reCurse: Seems hard to believe tbh
 reCurse: You sure you controlled for the CPU?
 darkhorse64: I ran my code (a C4 bot) several times with and without the avx code to account for different machines measuring my rollout count and I did the same thing on my machine. On CG, I see no significant difference. I agree that it"s a surprising result. So I went out checking my pragmas. I also used Gobolt tool to inspect my code (does GCC produce the  expected&#160;? It does). I have no explanation
 darkhorse64: expected asm
 reCurse: What your cpu?
 reCurse: 's
 darkhorse64: i9 10th gen
 jacek: everyone has new cpus but me&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: Xmas&#160;!
 reCurse: So Comet Lake?
 reCurse: Might have more execution ports for whatever you were doing somehow
 reCurse: Only explanation I can find for now
 RoboStac: were you u sing the gather instructions for memory access?
 RoboStac: they're really bad on older cpu's
 eulerscheZahl: model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz
 RoboStac: though I wouldn't expect them to be worse than scalar
 reCurse: I've read reports they can be but haven't experienced it myself
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7f7a8a1-8980-4f7c-9613-8ead444e2080">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7f7a8a1-8980-4f7c-9613-8ead444e2080</a>
 reCurse: Hmm really nothing special...
 RoboStac: odd
 darkhorse64: As this is against common knowledge, I have not ruled out a mistake from my part but I do not see it
 reCurse: I'd be curious to investigate but without access to that kind of CPU it's a waste of time
 darkhorse64: Yeah, reproducing the problem is not enough except for my self esteem
 jacek: you dont have bottom or up rows for checking the diagonals?
 darkhorse64: No guard bits, C4 is 63 bits but I have masks for that
 MSmits: might it have something to do with branch prediction?
 struct: but how does that explain his local performance gain?
 MSmits: well it might be one cpu does a better job of this
 MSmits: you could try to make the linear version branchless except for the one at the end
 MSmits: I guess the compiler and/or cpu/branch prediction combination should easily be good enough to do this right though
 the-mysterious: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/15420436484b0240733e8b6ace262fae87f49b6">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/15420436484b0240733e8b6ace262fae87f49b6</a>
 MSmits: my theory  doesnt seem likely
 the-mysterious: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/15420436484b0240733e8b6ace262fae87f49b6">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/15420436484b0240733e8b6ace262fae87f49b6</a>
 struct: stop spamming 
 the-mysterious: pls joibd
 reCurse: Could be wrong but I don't think branch prediction has changed that much recently
 MSmits: i dont know that much about it, but it just doesnt seem like a clean comparison between avx and linear
 MSmits: because of the 4 conditionals
 RoboStac: if anything I'd expect that to count against the linear version though
 reCurse: ^
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but if his local cpu does this poorly somehow...
 MSmits: and on CG it goes right
 MSmits: who knows.... 
 reCurse: I'd be surprised a newer cpu would have such a regression
 MSmits: sure, but we're stumped anyway, so it's probably gonna be something weird
 jacek: robo's working on breakthrogh? :scream:
 MSmits: well you showed a nn can work
 MSmits: it's your fault
 RoboStac: yep
 RoboStac: (it's one of the first I tried NN on and I've made massive improvements since then that I thought were worth trying)
 jacek: well now i can see where my bot blunders. on bad positions even in late game it says score 0.8-0.9 just to one ply later be -0.5
 reCurse: Namely?
 MSmits: jacek not sure if thats blundering though. I assume you mean 2 plies  later and two levels of depth can dramatically change score
 MSmits: by detecting a trap you didnt before
 reCurse: What kind of massive improvements
 MSmits: usually true for mcts as well
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: could be blundering, just dont be too quickk to assume is all i am saying
 jacek: or it was good position after all but my bot could keep playing the good line
 jacek: couldnt
 MSmits: why couldnt it?
 MSmits: this sort of question is terribly difficult to investigate
 MSmits: who knows what the bot was doing
 jacek: i dont
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 MSmits: it being a NN makes it worse because it's difficult on two levels
 MSmits: you have the huge tree and even a single node of the tree is difficult to understand because you dont understand the evaluation
 MSmits: I think both reCurse and RoboStac have had bugs in their framework for long periods of times they didnt spot because of things like this, correct me if I'm wrong
 jacek: folks in chess have this nice simple visualisator <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/718853716266188890/797492718431109182/unknown.png?width=1087&amp;height=714">https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/718853716266188890/797492718431109182/unknown.png?width=1087&amp;height=714</a>

 RoboStac: most of my problems that I've fixed have just been things being slightly non-optimal that then makes a big difference (eg merging duplicate states in training stopped so the initial few states aren't massively over-represented in my training data)
 jacek: looks like some old strategy game
 MSmits: ah Robo, so you've never had situations where your bot did something you thought was silly and it turned out to be an error in the NN?
 MSmits: that must be nice
 MSmits: I hate when my bot does dumb stuff and I don't know why
 jacek: or they right stuff and you dont know why
 MSmits: oh i just assume its my awesome coding in that case
 reCurse: You don't investigate errors in the NN
 MSmits: Jacek: those pics you sent are an attempt similar to what the tensorflow playground does. Making it visual. Seems hard when you have 10k nodes though
 MSmits: reCurse you just skim through the code if you suspect an error and hope to spot it?
 MSmits: not a weird method, i do it all the time 
 reCurse: At least if I understand you correctly, there's no point in figuring out the weights that caused something to not evaluate correctly
 reCurse: You have to build hypothesis at a higher level and correct the training
 MSmits: well you do have to make sure its because of the training and not a real bug
 reCurse: Well I mean unless you got the math wrong I don't see what else
 reCurse: But even wrong math, if it's consistent, the NN will adapt to it
 MSmits: i guess there could be a bug in your search
 reCurse: Just won't be as good
 MSmits: but you've done that so many times, its probably not likely
 reCurse: I don't know, I think this is too hypothetical
 MSmits: personally i mess up mcts all the time still
 MSmits: yeah it is
 MSmits: did you get started on the new project yet?
 RoboStac: the mcts part is basically identical on all my NN bots so I'm fairly happy it's bug free
 reCurse: No, there's an area I wanted to investigate for performance first
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: There's metrics that have been bugging me in my nn code
 reCurse: Could be nothing or it could be a 4x perf gain, who knows
 RoboStac: having said that I did make an improvement recently in how I choose my next move  (which got me #1 on oware and #2 on bandas as well as making yava/othello stronger)
 MSmits: RoboStac yeah i try to copy code as well, but i always end up with little differences in whether i expand 1 child or all children, or how i handle player switching and the mcts solver. Mostly it is sign errors
 MSmits: i guess with a nn you dont care so much about those details
 reCurse: The whole mcts balancing thing is still there
 RoboStac: expanding all children sounds horrendous as that'd be many many nn evals
 RoboStac: but yeah, all thats still possible
 jacek: RoboStac different (p)UCT?
 jrke: is there any way i can save bytes in json in python?
 MSmits: yeah that wouldnt work with such slow eval
 jacek: but thats what i do :o
 jacek: well for bt i do it partially
 MSmits: do you try both ways jacek?
 MSmits: it's different for every game what works best
 RoboStac: I used to have some bots using most visits and some using best score to choose the move as it seemed to work differently depending on the game - I've changed to a combination of both that seems to work better
 MSmits: yeah, i do highest value, but you risk picking a node that hasnt been visited much and only in the last 1000 visits or so bumped up its value
 MSmits: which means it is very uncertain
 jacek: yeah, for final move i have score + log(visits), so probably roughly equivalent to lower confidence bound
 reCurse: I'm convinced mcts is not the good approach but I have yet to come up with better
 MSmits: depends on your definition of mcts, there are so many ways to adapt it that maybe the thing you're not convinced about can simply be improved with some changes
 reCurse: I could get it all wrong but it's assuming a relatively stationary target
 reCurse: But in adversarial that's not quite true
 reCurse: And it adapts very poorly
 MSmits: you have to look at the full picture though and consider the alternatives
 MSmits: it does search quite deep
 reCurse: I only have the intuition there's much better to do for those scenarios
 reCurse: So for what it's worth
 MSmits: it's been shown to be weak for games with a lot of narrow lines of play
 reCurse: You have to hack it up for solving
 reCurse: So who says you don't have to hack it up further
 reCurse: And at that point is there even any theoretical ground left for mcts
 MSmits: well the main feature is to simulate games with at least a random component to selecting moves
 reCurse: There's no random component?
 reCurse: It's not forced
 reCurse: It is AN option
 MSmits: it has monte carlo in the name
 MSmits: i guess it's a matter of definition
 reCurse: I feel like I explained that before :sweat:
 MSmits: nah we had this discussion before and you did explain, it's really a matter of definition
 jacek: lets make new search, LVTS - las vegas tree search!
 MSmits: i do mcts with no random rollout
 MSmits: but imho i should just call this uct guided best first search
 MSmits: it's not really mcts... but thats definition
 MSmits: jacek sure
 MSmits: reCurse I do understand your intuition about mcts, I stare at meta mcts a lot and it often feels very unstable
 MSmits: but the problem is that if you use something a lot you tend to magnify the shortcomings
 reCurse: I'm not saying it doesn't work obviously
 MSmits: I know
 reCurse: I'm just saying it seems to have a huge problem
 MSmits: it does
 reCurse: That if corrected would lead to a much, much better alternative
 MSmits: if that's possible, I mean a substantial correction, not just another fancy enhancement
 reCurse: I'm talking new algorithm
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: well please share it when you've found it and trashed us enough with it&#160;:)
 reCurse: If that even happens, I suspect it would take a few more years of tinkering and thinking
 MSmits: maybe it already exists among the legion of papers on mcts
 MSmits: stuff gets buried
 jacek: i wish there was mcts survey but for 2020, with latest inventions
 MSmits: the focus is mostly on machine learning I think
 jacek: i meant mcts with machine learning
 MSmits: right, but it might be cleaner to do it with a simple eval 
 MSmits: if you're just interested in the search
 MSmits: otherwise any test is going to raise questions about the quality of the training of the NN and such
 MSmits: limit your variables is what we teach students in physics
 reCurse: But they're not independent variables
 MSmits: no, but the things you're worried about with mcts should be present both with a NN and a simple eval
 reCurse: I disagree
 MSmits: hmm ok
 reCurse: Your approach is entirely different if you have binary results from a random rollout vs a more informed eval
 Angecide: btw, on a high level, how does mcts with no random rollout work? Do you do a shallow dfs search of some sort instead of random rollout?
 MSmits: oh, sorry, i did not mean that simple of an 3eval
 MSmits: i mean like a traditional eval
 MSmits: that is still used in games like chess in most engines
 RoboStac: usually just an evaluation of the position instead of continuing further Angecide
 Angecide: ahh I see
 MSmits: but  a shallow search can work too
 MSmits: there are papers on this as well
 MSmits: personally i usually just eval the position and immediately backpropagate
 MSmits: usually some average of all children evaluated (you can also pick the best)
 MSmits: it makes the search horribly deterministic if you leave out the random though
 Angecide: I can see how this would be hugely advantageous in terms of performance and such, but getting the idea for a good eval function sounds really hard 
 MSmits: depends a lot on the game Angecide
 MSmits: if you've just done uttt, then you're right
 Angecide: yeah, it will probably get easier with experience
 jacek: still in gold eh?
 MSmits: tbh uttt is one of the hardest games to get out of gold in
 MSmits: even if so many people did it
 Angecide: yea I can reach legend now if I want, but I wanna finish up all the bugs and performance upgrades before submitting again
 reCurse: Not to be contrarian but I disagree
 reCurse: You literally don't need to know anything about the game
 MSmits: thats because you can type up optimized code in your sleep
 reCurse: Just optimize a vanilla mcts and it's guaranteed legend
 reCurse: What other game doesn't require you any understanding of it to get legend?
 MSmits: the optimization part is what is hard
 jacek: csb
 struct: optimization part was not that hard imo
 MSmits: again, for you, you were able to avx csb, something very few still have been able to do struct
 struct: Well I had help from marchet PCR code
 reCurse: You don't need anything fancy, just basic c++
 MSmits: for a year or so, uttt had 1k players of which 35 or so were in legend if i remember correctly
 MSmits: people have a lot of problems reaching 20-25k rollouts
 MSmits: just the fact that you almost have to use c++ to have chance
 MSmits: how many other games have that
 reCurse: Lots
 reCurse: Though nowadays c# and rust are most likely doable
 MSmits: I dont know so many games where c++ is a must
 MSmits: i always see java in legend and other languages
 MSmits: just not top 10
 MSmits: assuming its not a heuristic contest
 reCurse: Well you can say the same for uttt
 MSmits: ice and fire for example
 reCurse: Lots of java in the bottom of legend
 MSmits: yeah, I've had plenty of conversations with people who had to fight hard to do that with java. I barely managed with C# myself
 MSmits: then converted to C++ and tripled my simcount
 MSmits: anyway you're right, game strategy barely exists in uttt
 reCurse: I still maintain the fact you don't have to write any eval makes it easier than most games
 MSmits: the difficulty is just a different kind
 MSmits: makes it easier to write a reasonable bot, not easier to stand out 
 MSmits: apparently my daughter needs me to get some junkfood. Ttyl&#160;:)

 Illedan: Yeah, sorry about that. Someone wanted to try and smooth things over, was a waste.
 mzbear: oh, would you look at that, my hulk wins the boss in the next league as well
 mzbear: this league has 197 players, though, so maybe it's not winning every game anymore
 Salted: This is amazing! I'm jumping on this hulk train
 RyanGilbert: lol
 mzbear: nah, still winning every game against the boss.  but not winning against the other players.  how these other guys didn't beat the boss, i dont know.  plenty of other hulks doing the same thing i'm doing, it seems
 mzbear: i mean, the enemy boss buys 4 items, but still loses even though i have no items at all, because enemy boss tries grinding gold while i'm killing it
 Illedan: You have too many draw games mzbear
 mzbear: i suppose i'll have to buy items now
 Illedan: Just wait near tower for some turns and then attack afterwards 
 RyanGilbert: im solving stock exchange losses and for the largest dataset it times out
 RyanGilbert: im doing it in python, would it be better to try and convert it into another faster language and it will work
 RyanGilbert: or do i need a different algo
 jacek: think smarter, dont brute force it
 Salted: I think for some of the games, the boss isn't nearly as strong as the players in that league since the best players have all been promoted and the boss has sort of been left behind. For example the game of drones boss I can beat in gold league, but I can't beat the players at the top. 
 Salted: I mean the legendary league seems full and the good players are still in gold. 
 struct: gold boss might be broken
 struct: sometimes it happens with languages updated
 struct: s*
 mzbear: sometimes the boss is weak to some super simple greedy strategy, but the other players aren't
 Salted: I am being greedy for sure with that bot. 
 Salted: This hulk strategy is killing it!
 eulerscheZahl: like the contest gold boss ignoring groots
 eulerscheZahl: and losing to double hulk :D
 RyanGilbert: i correctly solved the hardest test case but failed all the others lol
 eulerscheZahl: you did the proof of concept, let's try the next puzzle
 RyanGilbert: ahh i wanna get it
 mzbear: changed my bot to purchase anything with damage, went afk, i'm in wood 1 now ... and it didn't automatically submit to arena?  but my bot works correctly, unlike the first 10 opponents.  rank 2 in wood1, it seems, because one opponent likes to stand at the tower which ruins my perfect strat ;D
 mzbear: i feel oddly disinclined to continue this now that i'd finally have to write something sensible
 eulerscheZahl: lots of other games to have fun with
 Astrobytes: That game is not one of them :P
 mzbear: i seem to have a problem.  i've written a dummy bot for 23 of the games, and i've only put any sort of actual effort into 3 of them
 MikkelAa: How can I challange a specific friend in a botgame?
 Astrobytes: That's not a problem. It just means you have things to work on mzbear&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: hi Astrobytes. the debug drawing was pretty straight forward
 jacek: you cant
 mzbear: UTTT was fun until i got to gold and would've finally had to implement a search
 eulerscheZahl: only had to patch the toggle module a bit the show entities in multiple toggle states and not just 1
 Astrobytes: Oh really? That's cool. No adverse effects?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: i limited it to 50 entities per player
 Astrobytes: Nice. Seems sensible.
 eulerscheZahl: if you create too many pixi objects, it will get laggy at some point
 eulerscheZahl: + replay size limit
 Astrobytes: CG mini-RAIC here we come :P
 eulerscheZahl: mini raic had no debug interface?
 Astrobytes: I don't know, but what I mean is  any RAIC style thing would certainly be mini on CG.
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: thought you were pointing to aicups.ru
 Astrobytes: no, I've never participated in those
 eulerscheZahl: i played 1 out of 4 contests
 eulerscheZahl: the other ones were to borderline complex
 eulerscheZahl: do you know agar.io?
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know it
 eulerscheZahl: they turned that into a contest
 Astrobytes: And the one you did was paper.io iirc
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Hopefully they do one this year.
 eulerscheZahl: last year was disappointing for contests
 eulerscheZahl: 3 on CG
 Astrobytes: Hopefully something good comes from the community discussion tomorrow. 
 eulerscheZahl: all-time low
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we were really spoiled before.
 eulerscheZahl: in case i'm late a bit, fight for my will
 eulerscheZahl: *original content
 Astrobytes: Noted.
 eulerscheZahl: and bosses that pop up during the week
 Astrobytes: Discussion will still be open anyway at least.
 Astrobytes: LEAGUES dammit!
 eulerscheZahl: prizes are optional IMO. for OOC it was in the void for most of the contest
 eulerscheZahl: still 2k players
 Astrobytes: I don't think it bothers that many people tbh
 eulerscheZahl: only relevant for top1%
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 eulerscheZahl: and half of those already have a tshirt collection
 Astrobytes: Bragging rights tho&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: one more point that I don't care about: overall contest leaderboard, achievements. do community events count for those?
 eulerscheZahl: probably they should. the 12 contests achievement would be tough otherwise
 Astrobytes: Not currently. Not sure they would implement that but perhaps.
 Astrobytes: Yes, valid point.
 eulerscheZahl: but i think i can make it tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: weird to schedule a meeting for a fixed time and then do it in writing
 Astrobytes: I'll be there unless I oversleep. Taking a day off tomorrow since I got up at 4am this morning.
 Astrobytes: lol right
 eulerscheZahl: i won't question your sleep schedule :D
 Astrobytes: Had things to do before certain times (international work stuff). Otherwise you'd never catch me up at that time unless I was catching a flight or at a party!
 eulerscheZahl: that's dedication for your job!
 Astrobytes: Nah, not much of a sacrifice to get up really early if it's needed.
 SilviuCristian45: hello
 AI_says_hi: hi o/
 dbf: oh, 4am is impressive! I wake up this time only if I'm on-call&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You gotta do what you gotta do!
 dbf: btw, they promised to have mini-raice somewhere in spring, but they fail deadlines often, so could be rescheduled
 Astrobytes: Ah that's OK. Just nice to have something else to play since there are fewer contests on CG these days&#160;:)
 Illedan: Glad it is fewer contests as I have more to do in life :D 
 AI_says_hi: Lucky you! Here you can't do anything because of Covid&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: This is certainly true for you Illedan&#160;:)
 dbf: I like that there is some break now because I need to recover from raic&#160;:)
 Illedan: Slightly thinking about trying that thing from Neumann though, but scared it might take too much time :P
 Astrobytes: When's the due date?
 Astrobytes: True dbf&#160;:)
 Illedan: Due date in 6 days
 Astrobytes: oof, I think you'll be busy during that contest in all honesty :D
 Illedan: naaah
 Illedan: She going to sleep!
 Astrobytes: Hahaha, positive thinking eh
 Illedan: I will most likely have my 10 days of during that period where my only goal is to learn about her
 Illedan: *off
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure
 Illedan: Might aswell learn her about codingame :P
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: Yep. Start them early I say!
 Illedan: Indeed
 Illedan: She is going til win her first t-shirt during the spring challenge&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Hehehe, gotta be done :D
 Illedan: I'll buy her a custom CG t-shirt before that contest anyway ^^
 Illedan: Or body or whatever it's called
 Astrobytes: Wait for RAIC, she can probably win a t-shirt there :P
 Illedan: Easier
 Astrobytes: How's the new job going?
 Illedan: 1 week of CSS and React until now, but far better setup on the project than anything earlier
 Illedan: So it is very good&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Good to hear! 
 dbf: are you ready to complete next CG contest with javascript now
 dbf:&#160;?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Nah, luckily the backend is in C#.
 Astrobytes: I doubt you would have taken the job otherwise :D
 Illedan:&#160;;)
 Valdez001: Hi
 Astrobytes: Lo
 jacek: whats this jacekism?
 Astrobytes: :3
 zhoubou: oO
 Astrobytes: Oh my.
 zhoubou: (I had to search chat history to see if it was oO or Oo)
 zhoubou: lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 zhoubou: How are you doing Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not too bad zhoubou, tired but OK. And yourself? How are things going over there after the earthquakes?
 zhoubou: For us, not bad as well. I myself am not frightened or anything. The state could be better in providing aid to the parts most hit by it.
 zhoubou: I'm at ease for now, I don't think about it too much.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it looks like it's gonna take some time and some real effort to rebuild. 
 zhoubou: Yeah, for sure. I'm also not happy how they're currently taken care of really.
 Astrobytes: Well, the worst is over. You can't predict the future so no point worrying about 'what if'&#160;:)
 zhoubou: You're absolutely right&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It's sad when government's abandon the people who require the most help Especially after a natural disaster like that.
 Astrobytes: *governments
 zhoubou: Yeah, and when they do react, it's too late.
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed. It's unfortunately rather common across the world.
 zhoubou: Yeah, it's the way it works. They only care if they will be elected next cycle. Nothing more. And they act when election is coming.
 Astrobytes: Not a great advert for our species is it :D
 zhoubou: Haha no, it isn't :sweat_smile:
 zhoubou: Wondering how we'll look back at the current state of the world in the future
 Astrobytes: If we get there that is...
 zhoubou: Ah, yes
 zhoubou: I don't give much hope to it really
 Astrobytes: But yeah, you'd like to think we'd be somewhat 'enlightened' in the future but... look at our history&#160;:/
 zhoubou: Well, we are 'enlightened' in some sense. Not much, but still, compared to past times.
 zhoubou: We are advancing at some pace
 zhoubou: At least that is what I believe. I might be dead wrong
 Astrobytes: True. In some respects. Other parts of human society don't really change at all.
 zhoubou: I agree with that.
 zhoubou: Society improves at glacial speed, if at all
 zhoubou: Technology is far, far ahead of society's current state.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, and it creates a lot of problems. Psychological issues, learning issues, general mental health.
 Astrobytes: Kids growing up on social media for example.
 zhoubou: Right on.
 Astrobytes: Tech advances are always cool, but it seems like we have bigger problems a little closer to 'home' that should be addressed first.
 Astrobytes: Ah, for an ideal world eh&#160;:)
 zhoubou: I disagree somewhat with that, though. Some problems at 'home' can't be solved unless we solve some other problems down the line.
 zhoubou: It's easier to create technology than to change society
 zhoubou: For the better, that is
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but what I mean is, if we can't even take care of our own citizens, each other etc without screwing them over - what's the point in advancing tech?
 Astrobytes: It's a top-down issue really.
 Astrobytes: As in what happens up top dictates that below it.
 zhoubou: Well at some point, technology solves problems we didn't know we had. Like with microscopes to see microbes that were the true reason for diseases, not demons and such.
 zhoubou: Not sure if I gave a good and true example there though.
 Astrobytes: Oh sure, of course. Though plenty still defy reason and follow the 'demons' etc&#160;;)
 zhoubou: Yes, but a critical mass of people don't believe that
 zhoubou: Anymore
 zhoubou: Some do, of course
 zhoubou: There will always be people like that.
 zhoubou: For crying out loud, there are people that believe Earth is flat
 zhoubou: :P
 zhoubou: But I agree with you to some extent
 Astrobytes: Yeah, thankfully!Oh yeah for sure.Indeed.I get your point though, tech advances can for sure help us on the way, they're just not leveraged in the right way I might say.
 zhoubou: Yeah, good point.
 zhoubou: If we don't fix the top problems, we will advance slowly
 Astrobytes: Incredible advances in healthcare, yet some deny access to people who cannot pay exorbitant sums for it. How does that benefit the whole?
 Astrobytes: Anyway, this is a Can of Worms discussion :D
 zhoubou: Yeah :P
 zhoubou: But I think you changed my mind a bit
 Astrobytes: I don't think any minds needed changing. Intelligent discussion just broadens the horizons.
 Astrobytes: *Extends the horizon
 zhoubou: Ah, yeah, you extended my horizon, right
 Astrobytes: lol
 zhoubou: :P
 Astrobytes: Rolling horizon evolutionary chat algorithm.
 jacek: s/ro/tro
 Astrobytes: Trolling horizon, hahaha
 zhoubou: Rather, troll on the horizon
 zhoubou:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed!
 zhoubou: Rolling horizon evolutionary chat algorithm might be my thesis for when I finally go to a college
 zhoubou: Or is it an algorithm that might write my thesis for me? I dunno
 Astrobytes: Not sure RHEAs are ideal for chatbots tbh 
 Astrobytes: Or thesis writing.... :D
 zhoubou: Awww
 zhoubou: Back to the drawing board it is
 Astrobytes: Hey, don't let me stand in your way :D
 jacek: AutomatonNN did you evolve yet
 AutomatonNN: check it out
 Astrobytes: ...
 zhoubou: Who wrote that bot btw?
 Astrobytes: Hover over its avatar
 zhoubou: Oh
 jacek: bot?
 zhoubou: It's a chat_bot_, is it not?
 jacek: AutomatonNN are you bot
 AutomatonNN: agade is a translator
 Astrobytes: You can get some info here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/</a>
 Automaton2000: that's the word i was looking at the referee
 Astrobytes: LOL "agade is a translator"
 Illedan: xD
 Lachrymosa: would someone be available to help me with conceptualizing a math problem?
 zhoubou: Very interesting read Astrobytes
 zhoubou: Lachrymosa What is troubling you?
 zhoubou: You can PM me if you want. I'm not a math wiz though.
 Lachrymosa: I am working on the easy puzzle bank robbers.So far I have the math for how long it would take per safe down. But I am having a hard time wrapping my head around a way to do the math for total time taken with multiple robbers
 Lachrymosa: the robbers would be working at the same time, but one may finish before the other and start on the next, and that one may be so hard the other robber does two in that time, and I just don't know how to do that elegantly. I'd throw a while loop at it and let it chug 1 by 1 lol
 zhoubou: Haven't tackled that one yet. Hmm
 Astrobytes: Do you sort the times?
 Lachrymosa: no
 Astrobytes: Have a think on that one.
 Lachrymosa: my initial naive thought was to sum the times and divide by the robbers
 Astrobytes: What will determine the total time of the heist?
 Astrobytes: (it's very simple but easy to miss)
 Lachrymosa: however long it takes the robbers to find all combinations of all safes, at a rate of 1 second per combination tried of all possible combinations per safe
 Illedan: I had to reread my code for that problem
 Astrobytes: Take a step back then think about it.
 Illedan: ^
 Astrobytes: Me too Illedan, I'd forgotten what it was.
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: Pushed a new feature for my tool now :tada:
 Astrobytes: Don't tell me: it finishes NS apps for devs who don't finish them :P
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: My repo navigator thingy
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://kvanli.com/stories/openrepo">https://kvanli.com/stories/openrepo</a>
 AI_says_hi: that looks pretty useful Illedan :thumbsup:
 Illedan: I added the script part today. So that I can open a repo in vscode, as I needed it for my React work at work today :P
 Astrobytes: The best tools are born from personal requirements.
 Illedan: Indeed, fun to work with too :D 
 Illedan: And I can scope the work myself
 Astrobytes: Indeed. So 2021 will be the year of Useful Things From Illedan. 
 nhlong20: i have no idea about this
 nhlong20: omg
 Astrobytes: Lachrymosa: how are you getting on with it?
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: nhlong20, idea about what?
 Lachrymosa: I was approaching an idea but invalidated it
 nhlong20: the puzzle  i'm working on
 Lachrymosa: I sorted the times, and in set sizes of number of robbers was adding the largest number to the next set
 Astrobytes: Think simple. Like really simple. Forget any complicated ideas.
 Astrobytes: It is a case of do the calc, store it. Sort it in some way. Decide which one to output.
 Astrobytes: *sort the array of calculated values
 Lachrymosa: yea I have a list of all the total times for safes, sorted from lowest to highest.
 Astrobytes: Do you need the total times for safes... or?
 Lachrymosa: Not all of them no, because some are happening and finished while others take longer.
 Illedan: I'm off, bye
 Astrobytes: gn Illedan
 Lachrymosa: pce Illedan
 Astrobytes: Think it through. You are really gonna kick yourself on this one.
 Lachrymosa: probably&#160;:\
 Astrobytes: I think I did the same until I had a eureka moment lol
 Astrobytes: "All the robbers work at the same time. A robber can work on one vault at a time, and a vault can be worked on by only one robber."
 Astrobytes: - so what determines the total time of the heist?
 Lachrymosa: The longest safe to solve, plus any overlap
 Astrobytes: Pay attention to that first line above.
 Lachrymosa: yea I get that they work at the same time but I can't figure out how to visualize in my mind how one robber 1 finishes his 250 second safe and moves to a 500 second safe that robber 2 is still working on his 1000 second safe and so the first 2 don't matter
 Astrobytes: Trying to give hints here without giving it away, not easy :D
 Lachrymosa: I understand, and I appreciate the help
 Astrobytes: Reflecting on previous comments: is it individual safe solving times you need to focus on?
 Lachrymosa: no i figured out how long it would take to solve each safe based on password complexity formulas. 
 Astrobytes: Perhaps it might be more prudent to relate the times to robbers and not so much the safes themselves?
 Lachrymosa: which is where i was leaning towards a while loop and brute force
 Astrobytes: Not necessary at all.
 Lachrymosa: just assign the next available safe to a robber as they hit 0
 Lachrymosa: I know it shouldn't be the answer as brute force rarely is. 
 Astrobytes: Keep a little array for R robbers, update their times accordingly in the for loop 
 Astrobytes: Remember: Robbers deal with the different vaults in increasing order
 Lachrymosa: so they magically know how complex each safe is and will start with the least complex?
 Astrobytes: Hehe, no. You need a break bud&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: maybe, I am coming here after work &gt;&lt;
 Astrobytes: I'm not gonna give it away, you got this puzzle I'm telling you.
 Lachrymosa: and work was mind numbing :V onboarding crap, hundreds of accounts and logins and no one owns all of it so I have to go to twenty different help desks to get default passwords and more than half the time they just reset the password and say "jobs done" without still giving me any basic credentials.
 Astrobytes: lol jeez, you left the military now or just different posting?
 Lachrymosa: better job in the military
 Astrobytes: Nice. Good stuff. Computer related I hope.
 Lachrymosa: no more getting oily and bloody busting knuckles lol
 Lachrymosa: Yea, cyber security
 Astrobytes: Awesome. Oh were you on aircraft maintenance?
 Lachrymosa: vehicular, worse in many ways lol
 Lachrymosa: but also better in an equal amount
 Astrobytes: Haha, yeah, I have a friend who's ex USAF aircraift maint.
 Lachrymosa: I didn't have to get exposed to cancer in a can
 Lachrymosa: just diet cancer in a can XD
 Astrobytes: lol right
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I've been up since 4am and it's 11pm, I'm gonna eat something and sleep.Hit me up tomorrow (or anyone else) if you ain't got this puzzle done
 Astrobytes: I think you'll get it after a little break though.
 Lachrymosa: Thanks, have a good rest!
 Astrobytes: Will do, take it easy dude
 Lachrymosa: ACK! I just solved it
 AI_says_hi: Congrats :D
 AI_says_hi: Long fight :p
 Lachrymosa: longer than it should have been &gt;&lt; i'm mentally exhausted but physically wide awake
 Lachrymosa: hate being like this, it feels like a waste of conciousness
 IlyasElBani: is the website lagging&#160;?
 AI_says_hi: always happens around this time&#160;:)
 RyanGilbert: I feel like website devs should put up a banner at the top of the screen when the server calculates scores
 AduDarkWa: ++&#160;:(

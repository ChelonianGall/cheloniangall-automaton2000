 Manhar: cout&lt;&lt;"hello my love"
 AGroatEatingGoat: C# can be good for speed, if that's what you're most comfortable with
 AGroatEatingGoat: Python is one of the best, though, in both the speed and golf categories
 AGroatEatingGoat: I'm (re)learning a lot about python from doing these!
 AGroatEatingGoat: Python is literally executable psuedocode, it's just beautiful &lt;3
 void_main_sucks: Nooo not using namespace std; &gt;&#160;: (
 AGroatEatingGoat: bruh, void_main_sucks but you don't include a return statement in main
 AGroatEatingGoat: :kekw:
 void_main_sucks: forgot to lol i just use the starting code
 AGroatEatingGoat: hehe
 Aa_Ku_Ttp: hello world
 CaptainKitten_322e: salom
 CaptainKitten_322e: kim bor. yaxshimisizlar?
 Godofdeath1: hello
 CaptainKitten_322e: qayerdansiz
 Redbladexix: theres is nothing better at a boring job than to train ur brain by playin some pod race :D
 void_main_sucks: sometimes i think some players are bots
 acuto: g0 g0 g0
 derjack: oO
 magaiti: do you sometimes think you are a bot too?
 derjack: how many symmetries clobber has from starting position? just normal and rotate180?
 MSmits: 28 moves
 MSmits: 112/4
 MSmits: simplest way is to just move each piece to the right and ignore down, left and up
 MSmits: then you have all unique moves
 derjack: im talking about board
 derjack: if you rotate by 90, youll get white in left down corner. it seems not the same board anymore
 MSmits: me too 
 MSmits: ah, then dont do the 90
 MSmits: you can do 180
 derjack: right now im doing 180
 MSmits: you can also mirror diagonally
 MSmits: I think
 derjack: :tada:
 derjack: so i may get 4 positions per move to label
 MSmits: you may get 8
 MSmits: the starting board has 4
 MSmits: but maybe later boards have more
 MSmits: you should just use the othello scheme
 MSmits: its the same 8x8 squares
 MSmits: so the same transformations apply. Just most of them aren't reachable
 derjack: i think it may mess up the 'real' representation of game
 derjack: because whites will be on entire different squares
 derjack: maybe near endgames it doesnt matter
 MSmits: yes they will when you transform them, but that doesnt mean the transformation is wrong
 MSmits: it just means its not a reachable state
 MSmits: this is true for every game, all states in the treespace are reachable, but not all states in the statespace are
 MSmits: well almost every game I guess
 MSmits: for example oware has many states where all pits have seeds
 MSmits: but they are all unreachable except the start
 MSmits: because after every move there is an empty pit
 derjack: still gotta work on better inputs. fairly trained agent wins 15% vs mcts
 darkhorse64: I am surprised that mcts works so well. tric gave up on ab and started his first mcts
 derjack: mcts works better if you dont have any good eval
 derjack: i wonder if clobber will become performant mcts-fest like uttt
 darkhorse64: true but it turns out that all papers that I read were based on heuristics. 
 darkhorse64: However, these look quite difficult to bitboard. There will be a tradeoff between number of light/heavy rollouts
 derjack: welp 10x10 is difficult to bitboard anyway
 darkhorse64: In retrospect, 8x8 was a wise decision
 derjack: until i solve it, yes
 darkhorse64: I trust NN to bambozzle MCTS
 MSmits: if you find the right heuristics for ab, you can also use them for a mcts with eval, or a jacekmax
 MSmits: either way mcts could come out ahead
 MSmits: or you could just keep the random rollout and use heuristics there
 MSmits: depending on whether they are pruning heuristics or heavy rollout heuristics
 MSmits: NN might not bamboozle mcts here depending on how important the math is. NN can simulate mathematical heuristics of course, but it doesnt do it more efficiently than the math itself. 
 MSmits: or you could combine the math with an NN... that would probably be best
 YurkovAS: how to find 4 in row with pdep? for example: horizontal line from left to right. we check 3 left and check 3 right separately (i'm understand hot to do) or need only 1 time check?
 MSmits: which game?
 MSmits: yavalath or connect 4?
 YurkovAS: connect4 or yavalath
 YurkovAS: yes
 MSmits: well its different
 MSmits: i wouldnt use pdep/pext for connect 4 so...
 MSmits: in yavalath what I do is this:
 MSmits: in the first 1s, for each of the 61 hexes I generate a star pattern around it in bitform
 MSmits: the start pattern goes 3 steps in each direction
 MSmits: at max this will be 18 bits around it
 MSmits: these 18 bits are all located somewhere on the 61 bit board
 MSmits: Then I generate all possible combinations of these bits
 MSmits: set/not set
 MSmits: when I play a hex, i PEXT the star pattern
 MSmits: and then do  a lookup to see if its a win
 MSmits: so the lookup handles all 6 directions at once
 derjack: YurkovAS i used this to generate patterns <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/skeeto/yavalath">https://github.com/skeeto/yavalath</a>
 YurkovAS: MSmits, derjack thanks!
 MSmits: yeah, there's various levels of calculation vs lookup
 MSmits: you can also do 3 lookups, one for each axis, then you use 6 bits, but have to do 3 PEXTs
 MSmits: some players do this
 MSmits: also YurkovAS, if you still want to know how to do it in connect 4. Use SIMD to check 4 directions at once
 MSmits: so no lookups, no pext/pdep. Full calculation
 darkhorse64: ^
 MSmits: and if you're afraid of simd, just do it without simd first to get the bot working. That may motivate you to experiment with Simd after. It's not the hardest game to parallelize (othello is far harder)
 YurkovAS: yes, easy rules, i'm try simd, thanks!
 MSmits: np
 darkhorse64: YurkovAS: write bitboarding for C4 first, do not jump straight to simd if you have no prior experience. Once your bitboarding code is OK, you will see more easily the parallel code patterns
 MSmits: also lots of unit testing&#160;:)
 MSmits: use your working normal win checking and then your simd version
 MSmits: run them both for every move your bot makes, see if they are ever different and if so, produce an error
 MSmits: I didn't actually do this, but I am an idiot and don't follow my own advice
 MSmits: my method: Just do the simd thing, see the bot fail and stare at code for hours
 darkhorse64: improved method: print the bit patterns and stare at them for a few minutes
 MSmits: yeah
 magaiti: staring intensely at machine code is the popularized method of debugging
 MSmits: indeed
 yoyokid: Hi
 MSmits: yoyo
 AntiSquid: MSmits how do you define you vars for bitboarding&#160;? typedef unsigned long long  U64;&#160;?
 darkhorse64: uint64_t
 MadKnight: yea there's a built-in type for that
 AntiSquid: ok looking at the differences
 darkhorse64: it works also for VS
 AntiSquid: so much info on bitboards for chess specifically, but not in mood to do chess right now 
 MadKnight: they added chess multi to CG&#160;?
 AntiSquid: community made
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we gotta go rekt everyone in chess
 Automaton2000: now that's a good thing
 AntiSquid: well recurz made and community approved
 MadKnight: well if recurz made it....
 MadKnight: no it's still the same
 AntiSquid: odd though he didn't submit anything
 MadKnight: probably wasn't interested
 MadKnight: too common and too much solved
 MadKnight: so actually not a surprise
 AntiSquid: ah so you already have the #1 bot in your mind but you need to write it
 AntiSquid: as expected of MadAsAJazzer
 AntiSquid: MadKnight *
 MadKnight: wait wat?
 MadKnight: what is that about
 AntiSquid: referring to how you improve your bots when the time comes ...
 LearnerDuck: hi guys
 LearnerDuck: im new here
 LearnerDuck: whats up
 AntiSquid: hello new here&#160;! welcome&#160;!
 MadKnight: well i can probably analyze game strats better but #1&#160;?
 LearnerDuck: thanks  dude
 LearnerDuck: #2
 MadKnight: ez
 AntiSquid: MadKnight it's just a joke, ignore me. And yes your exact words from another time, long forgotten now.
 MadKnight: but #1&#160;?
 LearnerDuck: ok
 LearnerDuck: #1
 MadKnight: AntiSquid i mean i didn't understand the joke
 MadKnight: still no idea where it is
 derjack: :drum:
 derjack: and this is chess960

 derjack: bitboarding is relatively easy. king checks and castlings are meh
 AntiSquid: oh my D bot still wrecking noobs
 derjack: oh your
 6cdh: My bad English even can't understand the problem description.
 derjack: oO
 AntiSquid: which problam
 derjack: and hes from usa. hmmm
 AntiSquid: he migrated and didn't learn the language i guess
 zedd001: Hello everyone, I just want to ask where do you learn advanced programming?
 AntiSquid: on your own? you can do it here too
 zedd001: Thanks for your sharing so much&#160;!
 MadKnight: what is advanced programming zedd001&#160;?
 MSmits: it's a natural follow-up on basic programming MadKnight
 MadKnight: but to what degree?
 MSmits: 7
 dirty_code: 42
 MadKnight: well that's easy just go finish 6 
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine asking what goes before 7
 Automaton2000: it's better to use a neural net
 MSmits: anyone here that solved bender 4 100%?
 MSmits: I have an approach I want to bounce off someone
 MSmits: before i code it
 AntiSquid: no but i think i have the solution figured out&#160;? :P
 MSmits: allright, so I want to do something like this:
 MSmits: the boulders are walls, at least at first
 MSmits: to make it easy
 MSmits: you can change the map with the levers
 MSmits: so i make a tree of map changes as opposed to a tree of movement
 MSmits: the parent is the first state, the children are new mapstates that are reached by doing the toggles that are within reach 
 MSmits: (without actually crossing other toggles)
 AntiSquid: ah i am thinking of a tree of moves, just keep looking till solution is found
 MSmits: thats too expensive i think
 MSmits: you get cycles and such
 MSmits: my way only requires a tree with a few 1000 nodes at most
 MSmits: then when you find a path, all you need to do is bfs from one node of the tree to the next
 MSmits: if you know a toggle is reachable by bfs without crossing other toggles it doesnt really matter what the route
 MSmits: is
 AntiSquid: damn ... you make me want to look into it and solve it now lol, i am quite sure that in worst case scenario i can use some conditions to ignore some moves
 MSmits: so basically i have a high level BFS where i chain toggles together instead of squared
 AntiSquid: or break the path into multiple searches
 MSmits: then a low level BFS to connect the toggles
 MSmits: i do a floodfill to find out which toggles are reachable from a current toggle position
 MSmits: (no matter the route used)
 AntiSquid: my reason for thinking this will work is the ooc bot i have which is highly unoptimized and the amount of stuff it can look for, think this problem is less demanding
 MSmits: oh I guess it is less demanding, but i want to expand it to also use boulders later, which are also map changes, like toggles. But they branch much much more
 MSmits: this is the approach i used in hypersonic and it was very fast there
 AntiSquid: i mean your way is basically same as breaking path into multiple ones to find otpimal one
 MSmits: in hypersonic, my bomber dude is every where at once and only gains a position when he changes the map
 MSmits: AntiSquid yes it is
 AntiSquid: and actually you can have tree of map states where each state has trees of paths or whatever ugh ... then prune / ignore less promising trees 
 MSmits: imho the way to go for bender4 is basic solution no boulders -&gt; add boulders to get better solutions -&gt; add functions 
 MSmits: AntiSquid thats the thing, i dont generate the paths
 MSmits: i only generate the changed map states
 MSmits: i dont care how bender gets to the next spot, only that he can (found by floodfill)
 MSmits: i only generate the path later, when fry is reached
 MSmits: so it's really a simple tree, not a tree of trees
 AntiSquid: ok how about finding all paths for all possible switch / bolder / stuff change and then finding out which combination of paths leads to solution  ?
 AntiSquid: i mean you precompute paths then look for combo
 MSmits: that may work, but i dont see why you need a precomputed pat
 MSmits: path
 MSmits: maybe a precomputed floodfill for each map state
 AntiSquid: less floodfills 
 AntiSquid: yes that's what i mean
 MSmits: ah ok, well thats a neat optimization
 MSmits: I want to try to at least solve it this weekend. I have some other stuff to do as well but hope to find some time
 MSmits: only 41 people have solved it 100%
 AntiSquid: is that your motivation&#160;?
 AntiSquid: low solver count&#160;?
 MSmits: also i told a student to do it
 MSmits: without realizing how hard it was
 AntiSquid: ah that changes everything
 MSmits: so i kinda feel like i have to. And I think it is interesting
 AntiSquid: idk, when i finally get around doing it i will start it with just first test case and then add rules for 2nd ... then 3rd etc .. and then a big rewrite at the end if needed :P
 MSmits: yeah that often makes sense
 MSmits: but i got an algorithm in mind i am sure works, so i want to try it as a whole
 MSmits: then optimize it, your suggestion is good
 MSmits: i did that in kutulu
 MSmits: calculate all that stuff beforehand
 AntiSquid: which suggestion&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ah
 MSmits: I think your way is what i suggested to the student
 MSmits: plot a direct path to the target
 AntiSquid: i only said that because you said it takes too long, will try it headon without precomputation first probably :D
 MSmits: if there are obstacles, make a direct path to the toggle you ned
 MSmits: if there are obstacles to that, make a direct path to anothe toggle etc.
 MSmits: until you get there
 MSmits: thats another way to do it
 MSmits: but i think he may get stuck on cyclic toggles, where you untoggle something important when moving to a different toggle
 MSmits: sometimes they are in the way
 AntiSquid: this one has functions 
 MSmits: that too, but thats like loops in code of the ring
 AntiSquid: i think it was the function bits you can encode reason why i left it for later
 MSmits: its just intended to make the solution shorter
 AntiSquid: seems very time consuming
 AntiSquid: 889 CP max, it was lower back then too, maybe 200 max
 MSmits: I think i can do the simple solution in a few hrs, then i'd be rank 42 at least
 MSmits: so it's worth it
 MSmits: brb
 AntiSquid: i stopped improving my fireworks / pengu for now, need full rewrite to progress so kinda aiming for lower hanging stuff instead
 AntiSquid: ah right unoptimized solution shouldn't take that much, but with only rank 42 you get a drop in a bucket as CP
 AntiSquid: top 10 min @ 2,243 
 MSmits: thats a lower limit, assuming the worst possible solution though
 MSmits: i can easily adapt to find shorter solutions and get somewhat better rank
 MSmits: if i include boulders (lots of coding) it should get a lot better
 MSmits: then with functions, you can get any rank you want if you do it well enough
 MSmits: probably the validators are known as well, so you might be able to make use of that
 AntiSquid: "you can get any rank you want if you do it well enough" 
 MSmits: till i get bored
 AntiSquid: or are willing to spend 
 MSmits: i did code of the rings till top 20, which is quite good for a game with so many players
 AntiSquid: not asking you superficially, just generally speaking
 MSmits: ah yes
 AntiSquid: maybe i should do another hex game&#160;? 
 MSmits: do you like boardgames?
 AntiSquid: on CG&#160;? no
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well coders of the carribean is not really a board game and is hex, but you probably did that already
 AntiSquid: maybe i should at least try to do something on my own game
 MSmits: yavalath is a boardgame so doesnt qualify then
 MSmits: oh cool, did not know you were working on something
 AntiSquid: pengu is different because you eliminate tiles and that changes a lot
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but boardgame-wise it's just a bit mask
 AntiSquid: also check the amount of hex / line
 AntiSquid: they are not the same, that cause me some headaches
 AntiSquid: figured something new out just to make it work :P
 AntiSquid: initially thought i have to check if row is odd or even
 MSmits: makes sense
 AntiSquid: and i have the board in one array, so if i rewrite i should use uint64
 MSmits: probably
 AntiSquid: ideally .
 MSmits: unless you do a minimax
 MSmits: then do/undo works fine on any type of board
 AntiSquid: no won't do that
 MSmits: assuming you dont use transpositions, hashing complicated gamestates is expensive
 MSmits: uint64_t helps a ton with hashing
 AntiSquid: i have minmax on some games and i feel like i could have done much more with mcts 
 MSmits: i guess it depends on where your skill/knowledge lies
 MSmits: i suck at minimax, compared to what i can do with mcts
 Astrobytes: It depends. If minimax is performing well but you've run out of ideas, some kind of EPT MCTS might be better.
 AntiSquid: even make some custom selection of my own, doesn't matter if it's weird
 Astrobytes: You do have to invest some effort in an a/b to make it good
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw gotta go, class starts in 5 mins (as a student, not teacher)
 MSmits: dont want to make teach mad :P
 Astrobytes: FP?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: educational research
 Astrobytes: Oh right
 MSmits: FP is every other friday, next friday again
 MSmits: ttyl!
 Astrobytes: later
 AntiSquid: see you next friday :P
 Astrobytes: doesn't quite work as well as Tuesday or Thursday eh
 Astrobytes: working on penguins?
 AntiSquid: no
 Astrobytes: yava?
 AntiSquid: he was comparing coders of caribbean to pengus  and i was saying it's not the same
 AntiSquid: tiles keep getting removed that's major diff
 Astrobytes: Oh, yeah, quite different indeed
 Astrobytes: And penguins is a board game
 AntiSquid: and really odd board shape for pengus
 AntiSquid:  you get 8 hex for odd 7 for even
 AntiSquid: very important detail
 Astrobytes: Only in your indexing
 Astrobytes: I like penguins, good game. Must get back to it soon.
 AntiSquid: maybe yinsh if i do another hex game, it looks weird and i don't really get it 
 derjack: are yo hex excited
 Astrobytes: It's quite complicated compared to some others, but not to hard to get if you spend some time learning it. Haven't a clue for a good algo though
 derjack: still need to make sim for it
 Astrobytes: Yeah same
 derjack: no boss so it cant become potw
 Astrobytes: Not necessarily a bad thing - do you think explaining yinsh to every Tom, Dick and Harry on cg every 5 minutes for a week? :D
 Astrobytes: *think you'd enjoy
 Redbladexix: looking for the most beginner friendly bot games. To advance on my questmap need another one to reach bronze league.
 derjack: tryangle is potw and yet no one asks about it
 derjack: coders strike back
 Astrobytes: True... are many people playing it?
 Astrobytes: TC I mean not CSB
 derjack: 24 now. before it was less than 20
 derjack: not much boost
 derjack:&#160;:(
 derjack: AutomatonNN where is the creator
 AutomatonNN: with page in the top right
 Astrobytes: That must be the Disappointment aspect.
 AntiSquid: Redbladexix botters of the galaxy
 AntiSquid: oh wait it asks for legend at the end
 AntiSquid: probably CSB and you can't play any community games for this lol
 AntiSquid: CSB easiest legend do that Redbladexix, rules change in gold
 Redbladexix: CSB already at bronze need another one for this quest
 AntiSquid: what quest is it&#160;?
 Redbladexix: reach bronze in 2 games
 AntiSquid: oh you need later silver in 2 games
 AntiSquid: hmmm
 derjack: ultimate tic tac toe&#160;:?
 AntiSquid: is it 3x3 until silver&#160;?
 derjack: is 3x3 only in wood
 AntiSquid: in silver it's more complicated, more headaches
 AntiSquid: do botters of the galaxy until silver should be very easy
 Redbladexix: ok, will try. thx for the help
 AntiSquid: mean max for silver also very little coding actually
 AntiSquid: and maybe code royale too? but can't remember anymore for sure
 KelvinAndHubbles: tron bike till silver isn't too hard too

 JLukeSkywalker: that is whats given, in addition to just ore values
 ET_BB-8: if the enemy stops at the base for 1 turn it could mean the have picked up a trap
 darkhorse64: the whole game revolves around traps and efficient farming
 jrke: ET_BB-8 what if he picked radar not trap?
 ET_BB-8: thats the problem with that system
 ET_BB-8: but its better not digging up a radar position than digging up a trap position
 ET_BB-8: unless your going to kamikaze 
 jacek: is that utg?
 BlaiseEbuth: ya
 BlaiseEbuth: name changed for the multi
 darkhorse64: or if you dig a potential trap, make sure you will destroy one opponent bot at the same time
 jacek: or delete your account
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 ET_BB-8: in later leagues some players wait at the base for 1 turn also to throw off those systems
 jacek: it was fun to watch the replays
 BlaiseEbuth: Advanced kamikaze strategy was my greatest idea during the contest...
 darkhorse64: even better, they stop at several holes to puzzle you when trying to guess traps
 AntiSquid: have to fix that bot at some point . was close to legend

 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i think he is working on fixing the boss
 jacek: hm?
 JLukeSkywalker: think it might have been darkhorse, said he was trying to fix the connect 4 wood bot
 JLukeSkywalker: the current one is really bad
 jacek: blame the approvers
 darkhorse64: No, I did not write the boss
 JLukeSkywalker: ik, but the other day thought you said you were writing a new one
 Astrobytes:  I think that was a joke
 darkhorse64: It was a half serious joke
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe was a joke, but the boss is a joke
 JLukeSkywalker: someone does need to fix it
 struct: connect 4 is just depth 3 minimax
 struct: iirc
 struct: At least is what I  remember from when I saw the code
 Astrobytes: It's a what, depth 2? 
 Astrobytes: Oh 3
 JLukeSkywalker: and people are beating it with random
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe there is a bug in it
 Astrobytes: I can't remember. I remember it  looked really inefficient.
 darkhorse64: tbh, I did not checked it
 Astrobytes: If it's that bad then I personally nominate darkhorse64 to write a new one :P
 darkhorse64: You know, it's hard to nerf a bot
 Astrobytes: This is true. Just copypaste your alphabeta from Clobber
 Astrobytes: (not the eval perhaps :P )
 darkhorse64: I could also copypaste euler's C# bot
 Astrobytes: Is that any good? I'm sure I beat that by hand
 ZarthaxX: rude
 darkhorse64: MCTS with a solver.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but it was weak iirc
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxXamaton
 darkhorse64: If it beats cout &lt;&lt; "0" and random, it's OK
 ZarthaxX: Astronaut
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 imathwee: oi oi lads
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: that's fair
 Astrobytes: How's it going ZarthaxX?
 imathwee: how you gunna find the highest rated playa here
 MadKnight: js even crashes when u start a number with 0
 ZarthaxX: all gud
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine crashing from x=025;
 Automaton2000: i'm pretty sure you can do all that stuff
 ZarthaxX: trying to learn new stuff, was cleaning the house until now
 ZarthaxX: you astrobyto
 MadKnight: hey ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: Cleaning the house is new Zartho? :PYeah, same shit different day here lol
 ZarthaxX: hey mado
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes NO LOL i just said 2 different things
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX I know! :P
 ZarthaxX: *today i learned what a broom is guys!*
 Astrobytes: #winning
 ZarthaxX: so same shit eh
 ZarthaxX: fair fair
 Astrobytes: Yep
 ZarthaxX: what's up with that clobbeer game?
 Astrobytes: Not my bot anyway. It's last :D
 Astrobytes: Interesting game.
 ZarthaxX: real or invented
 jacek: whats the difference
 jacek: all games are invented
 ZarthaxX: wanted to know if it was a port
 darkhorse64: It is
 Astrobytes: Yeah, abstract board game, been around for 20 years
 ZarthaxX: aight ty guys
 ZarthaxX: also looks super simple, nice
 Astrobytes: Yeah, very easy sim.
 ZarthaxX: i bet right
 Astrobytes: The rest however...
 Tuo: looks can be desieving :D
 Tuo: my python bot was so slow it was useless
 Tuo: and c++ is hard
 ZarthaxX: also, random question but where is toad?
 ZarthaxX: has he been here the past couple days?
 Astrobytes: Long story best saved for another day ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: bad or nah?
 Astrobytes: Well, he's fine but it's a crappy thing.
 ZarthaxX: can you tell me another day?
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: Yes. Not today.
 ZarthaxX: ty
 ZarthaxX: hope he is doing well
 Astrobytes: All good afaik
 ZarthaxX: and another random thing, i got banana plants in my house, and the last one had 110 bananas approximately
 ZarthaxX: 27kg of bananas
 Astrobytes: Dude
 darkhorse64: He is OK but he has stepped down for a while
 ZarthaxX: aight aight , good then
 Astrobytes: 27 KILOS OF BANANAS
 Astrobytes: GROWN IN YOUR HOUSE
 Astrobytes: Wtf am I doing in this country
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: it's hard to keep them like.. not rotten
 ZarthaxX: eating all of them before they rot is hard, we freeze them but it's still a fuckton
 Wilster: you can make banana n.ut bread with ripe ones
 Astrobytes: Yeah, make some banana pureé  and stuff, less space when you freeze it
 Wilster: banana ice cream
 Astrobytes: And sell the skins to vegans, they like that kind of thing.
 Astrobytes: Or throw them in front of unsuspecting people and film the cartoon slip
 jacek: bananas with coke?
 Astrobytes: (the last two were jokes)
 jacek: its so hard to slip on banana
 ZarthaxX: oh we never tried the banana bread one, nice
 ZarthaxX: neither the pureé, we did the ice cream one
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes LOL the skins are thrown but to make compost 
 Astrobytes: Ah that's cool
 Astrobytes: Can you make some kind of alcohol from bananas? Or at least use as a flavouring.
 Astrobytes: You can make banana wine and beer apparently.
 Astrobytes: And therefore banana brandy
 Astrobytes: Stop this computer nonsense and open a brewery + distillery
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 ZarthaxX: isnt it kind of hard to achieve a good wine/beer?
 Astrobytes: Well, yeah. Takes practice. You have many bananas. 
 ZarthaxX: and who will be the victims that try it?
 Astrobytes: :P
 ZarthaxX: family? :D
 Astrobytes: Ofc!
 ZarthaxX: *and that's how you poison all your beloved ones*
 ZarthaxX: i think the ice cream one is safer hehe
 Astrobytes: Start with beer and wines, don't try and distill anything if you want to keep your eyesight/loved ones
 ZarthaxX: i bought a chocolate licour in the holidays, now that i reemember
 DaciaN0: are you pros?
 ZarthaxX: good one
 ZarthaxX: okey Astrobytes :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: bananas is the future
 Astrobytes: Sell them to Elon Musk
 ZarthaxX: DaciaN0 noob here
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i will make him tweet about my bananas
 ZarthaxX: easy money
 ZarthaxX: bananastocks raising
 Astrobytes: BananaX
 ZarthaxX: gotta find a good cryptocoin name
 Astrobytes: SparthanaxX
 ZarthaxX: :rofl: wtf
 Astrobytes: ooh wait: BanX
 ZarthaxX: nailed it :O
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's actually decent lol
 ZarthaxX: ye :P
 Astrobytes: Then when you're uber-rich you can get a gf called Dirt or something like him
 Astrobytes: (Elon's gf is called Grimes, grime = dirt, if anyone needed an explanation)
 Astrobytes: btw I am not beating the boss in Connect4 with random
 ZarthaxX: oh i didnt get it at first lol
 ZarthaxX: deception
 Astrobytes: Maybe I random wrong
 ZarthaxX: change your distribution
 jacek: you can beat the boss if you write only one column
 Astrobytes: really? lmao
 ZarthaxX: astro :sweat:
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have been looking at bitboard stuff for connect4 and all of them refer to 6*7 board
 jacek: 63 bits still fits
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I would be nice if there was a site with basic implementation for different games
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but i have to do it myself
 Astrobytes: Yeah, all the stuff you see about using the spare bits for this or that you can just do with some masks
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am thinking in this direction
 Astrobytes: Don't overthink it
 Astrobytes: It's just the same as every other bitboard game
 Astrobytes: *bitboardable
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I lack experience
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I guess at some point it becomes relatively easy
 Astrobytes: Some stuff yeah, but it always requires a degree of care!
 Ordonnateur: We can register to the codinggame spring challenge 2021 up to when&#160;? up to last minute&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: Up to any point throughout the challenge Ordonnateur
 Ordonnateur: ok thank you&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the other thing about bitboards is that once you try them it seems there is no way back
 Ordonnateur: (I will register later so, better than forgetting about it then being sad having a 0score on my history ;p)
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yes UnnamedCodinGamer, for some games to be competitive it's really a requirement anyway
 jacek: its easier for me to bitboard stuff than to use good old 2d array nowadays
 UnnamedCodinGamer: jacek yes, especially move generation
 UnnamedCodinGamer: in terms of performance I was actually surprised to see that in breakthrough my array implementation was a bit faster than the first bitboard implementation
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX o/
 jacek: move generation is one thing. eval stuff like counting is also fast
 ZarthaxX: hey kiwo&#160;:*
 UnnamedCodinGamer: then I implemented the move extraction using ffsl and it got 2 times faster
 UnnamedCodinGamer: jacek, that too yes
 jacek: ffsl/
 jacek: hmm looks like ctz or clz
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, they are similar 
 ZarthaxX: first set bit for long
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I did not know about them then
 struct: Returns one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit of x, or if x is zero, returns zero.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: struct, exactly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: in terms of performance i did not find it worse than __builtin_ctzl, but I may be wrong
 Astrobytes: oh nice
 UnnamedCodinGamer: actually darkhorse64 and you Astrobytes suggested that 
 jacek: probably came from msmits
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 MSmits: nope
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: always use ctz
 Astrobytes: ffsl? No that's a new one on me
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I meant move extraction, not the particular method
 Astrobytes: Ohhh right, gotcha
 MSmits: yeah i use ctz/ctzl for move extraction
 MSmits: ffsl also works
 Astrobytes: Never used ffsl
 MSmits: probably on compilation it works out to be equally fast somehow, compilers are smart
 Astrobytes: Any particular advantage to it?
 MSmits: i think it wont break on 0
 MSmits: clz has undefined behavior on 0, not sure about ctz
 jacek: well code is written it will never reach 0
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: thats why i dont bother with it
 ZarthaxX: those instructions compile to a single assembly one
 MSmits: i like my stuff to break when i screw up
 Astrobytes: I guess could be useful in some situations but I'll stick with ctz/clz
 Astrobytes: on here
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is nice if it breaks, and tells you so
 MSmits: c++ telling you whats wrong?
 Astrobytes: What sorcery is this????
 Astrobytes: You must find out where you were wrong yourself and hit yourself with a c++ branch 100 times.
 ZarthaxX: c++ branch LOL
 Jake_Dubz: hi guys i am new to coding:grin:
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: arent we all, to some extent
 MSmits: hi
 ZarthaxX: hi new to coding :grin:
 Astrobytes: Hi new to coding, we are not new to coding
 ZarthaxX: worst mod :P
 Astrobytes: I am not!
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid is way worse, and don't forget about BlaiseEbuth!
 darkhorse64: defensive programming is a very bad practice performance wise
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: defensive? what
 Jake_Dubz: i am new to coding, probably not you, but meeee
 Astrobytes: Defensive in #debug
 darkhorse64: checking always whether assumptions are wrong
 ZarthaxX: ah ye branching is super bad :D
 MSmits: I start doing that when i cant find a bug after X hours of staring
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes&#160;?
 MSmits: i drop in like 10 conditional cerr statements and thats usually enough
 Astrobytes: asserts and if (I'm fking up here) go in #debug mode
 darkhorse64: that's debugging. It's different
 ZarthaxX: astro knows :D
 MSmits: well it's all i do
 MSmits: never used an assert
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: the point being that's not the code you use in your main program
 ZarthaxX: use asserts D:
 darkhorse64: I know
 Astrobytes: You never used assert MSmits?!
 MSmits: nope
 ZarthaxX: this guy is crazy
 ZarthaxX: someone hold him
 <b>**ZarthaxX brings the c++ branch</b></p><p><img src="/a/58491929211531" /> AntiSquid: why use asserts? you should know what your program does
 <b>**Astrobytes holds MSmits and lets ZarthaxX beat him with the C++ branch</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I dont have any strong reason not to us eit, i just never tried
 MSmits: lots of things i never did with c++
 <b>**ZarthaxX starts beating Msmits with the branch nonstop</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: i never made a file with .h at the end
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: we're only hooman
 ZarthaxX: MSmits :I
 ZarthaxX: *shit*
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Oo
 AntiSquid: MSmits if you already have some efficient way to to debug you probably still don't need it
 MSmits: possibly i could save some time if i did use it, i dunno
 MSmits: I am very noob with C++
 AntiSquid: oh this again ...
 Astrobytes: It's in c too
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Astrobytes: Honestly it's a good sanity check
 MSmits: it's just a very tiny part of c++ i use, 1 file solutions with very few features from c++
 ZarthaxX: im tired of doing this already astro
 AntiSquid: remember that c++ meme with a guy learning c++? and then discovering immortality elixir, then time travel and then going into the past to kill his former self before he could waste time on learning all of c++&#160;? MSmits
 <b>**ZarthaxX gives c++ branch to astro</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: nope, dont know that meme
 AntiSquid: ya
 <b>**Astrobytes beats the **** out of MSmits to probably no real positive outcome</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: torture won't make me code better :P

 ZarthaxX: GIVE IT TO HIM ASTRO, YE
 ZarthaxX: MSmits we will see
 <b>**ZarthaxX brings the c branch</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I think this is true for any language btw. Euler is horrified about how i use C# also
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: but that's a meme about the 'teach yourself C++ in 21 days' books
 AntiSquid: same end result
 ZarthaxX: LOL squido
 ZarthaxX: MSmits how do you use it?
 ZarthaxX: i get it tho, the use you give to those lnaguages is purely for bots
 MSmits: like a c++ without segmentation faults, very simply, using very few features
 ZarthaxX: doesnt require you to know a lot
 Astrobytes: Let's just say, generics don't get a look-in
 ZarthaxX: thought so haha
 ZarthaxX: linq, what is that? :D
 MSmits: yeah i barely ever use linq
 MSmits: when i do, its because i copied some code from somewhere
 MSmits: but doing FP class, so maybe i'll start using it more
 Astrobytes: And you declare strange lists
 MSmits: how do you mean strange?
 MSmits: it just normal lists
 MSmits: objects, ints etc.
 MSmits: but generally I do it the same way as in C++ and just declare arrays that are large enough
 jacek: weird names
 Astrobytes: List&lt;T&gt;
 AntiSquid: well higher contest rank results means either linq is bad or best to focus on what matters, not how ugly the code is
 MSmits: linq is good for when coding speed matters and performance does no
 MSmits: t
 MSmits: would be great in code a la mode for example
 Astrobytes: List&lt;T&gt; is what you don't use
 MSmits: i dont, no
 MSmits: i just know the type of the list
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: You miss out on the whole power of generics
 MSmits: i dont template in c++ either
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: Heathen.
 MSmits: its not like i dont understand it, i just dont have practice with it
 struct: in cg it doesnt have much use tbh
 MSmits: these bots are all fairly short and at some point it just works
 AntiSquid: wait c++ template programming is like a programming language of its own
 Astrobytes: Practice! It can only improve your skills&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: C++ templates don't have to mean full on template metaprogramming insanity
 therealbeef: compile time limitations mostly prevent any serious template meta programming
 therealbeef: (ive tried)
 Astrobytes: Masochist!
 therealbeef: i'd be unfair anyway
 MSmits: why is it unfair?
 AntiSquid: you take a step in that direction, why would you ever stop
 MSmits: i dont see how i would get more performance using templates?
 therealbeef: you can do calculations at compile time, which other languages cant do
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: but in many cases that doesnt matter
 Astrobytes: because you can simply template functions and simple things without going nuts AntiSquid
 therealbeef: i calculated part of the uttt eval function at compile time
 MSmits: the first 1 second in most bots is already overkill
 Astrobytes: There is templates and then there is template metaprogramming
 AntiSquid: i know
 MSmits: because you need calculation time later on in the game, when moves have been made, not in the first second
 MSmits: exception is games where you use the full 1 second to precalculate endgame db or something
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert time banking comment here&gt;
 AntiSquid: 1 second to decode an entire book of most important moves and positions, think about it
 MSmits: actually in oware i dont decode, i calculate
 MSmits: i decode the opening book though
 MSmits: 9 seed db in 500 ms or so and a little bit of time for the 2-3k moves from opening book
 Tuo: uint64_t f = 1 &lt;&lt; i;such a simple line of code, the problem must be somewhere else
 AntiSquid: does this count as obfuscation&#160;? it does right?
 Tuo: hours of life wasted&#160;:(
 MSmits: what does?
 jacek: Tuo 1ULL &lt;&lt; i
 darkhorse64: tuo 1ULL &lt;&lt; i
 Astrobytes: Tuo: 1ULL &lt;&lt; i
 AntiSquid: books MSmits
 Tuo: y :D
 AntiSquid: tuo&#160;: 1ULL &lt;&lt; i
 MSmits: my oware book is very readable atm
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: havent needed to compress
 AntiSquid: ah k
 MSmits: {5{5{1{2{4{2{2  ... etc
 Tuo: i figured it out in the end, it just took way too long
 MSmits: it's a tree
 AntiSquid: what are you working on tuo
 MSmits: start with move 5, on move 5 from opponent, you play 1 etc.
 Astrobytes: Tuo: we've all been there
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i still do that
 Astrobytes: I would bet that tuo is working on Clobber
 MSmits: it's really annoying
 MSmits: VS warns me though
 darkhorse64: Read: we all made the mistake
 MSmits: get a green squiggle
 Tuo: y globber but im not that far :S
 MSmits: clobber is a nice game to start doing bitboards
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I wasted 10 minutes on it the other day
 MSmits: i wasted hours on this before
 MSmits: you're lucky UnnamedCodinGamer
 CryptoZenith: its not wasting if you enjoyed it
 MSmits: but then again, i dont assert so..
 Astrobytes: MSmits :P
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I was trying to print a bitboard and it printed half of it
 MSmits: ah yeah, typical
 MSmits: thats sometimes how i find otu
 Astrobytes: lol, there should be a list of common bitboard issues
 darkhorse64: LeRenard joins the party
 Astrobytes: Yay nice one
 MSmits: i sometimes shift a 32 bit 32 places to the left and then or it to a 64 bit
 MSmits: thats a similar error
 MSmits: does nothing
 ZarthaxX: what party¡
 MSmits: fox party&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Top 4 Clobber in 0.5
 AntiSquid: they call clobber a party
 MSmits: Sweeper, no swiping!
 MSmits: :fox:
 jacek: clob clob clopper
 ZarthaxX: hell of a party brothers
 Astrobytes: I think LeRenard just needs another submit, boss is probably boosted. His game history looks good
 LeRenard: I try a second submit with a updated weight
 Astrobytes: Looks a lot stronger LeRenard
 jacek: alpha beta?
 MSmits: a boardgame leaderboard is not the same without LeRenard on it
 Astrobytes: ^
 LeRenard: MCTS
 MSmits: cool, you usually do ab right?
 LeRenard: First good result with MCTS
 MSmits: ahh ok
 LeRenard: I try a MCTS on UTT but with bad result
 MSmits: your ab bots tend to be pretty strong. Yavalath one is hard to beat
 Astrobytes: It really seems MCTSy this game
 MSmits: LeRenard your uttt problem is probably optimization + lack of heuristics. Add some teccles magic
 LeRenard: But I copy paste may UTT MCTS in Clobber. 
 LeRenard: Yes I could retry on UTT
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what is teccles?
 MSmits: play 0 on empty 0 board
 MSmits: 1 on empty 1 board
 MSmits: 2 on empty 2 board
 MSmits: etc.
 MSmits: send opponent to same board
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. I was pinged an hour ago...
 darkhorse64: It's a Clobber chat only. Where is your bot&#160;?
 Astrobytes: sorry BlaiseEbuth, just saying that you're a worse mod than me to ZarthaxX :P
 UnnamedCodinGamer: MSmits, thanks
 MSmits: sometimes teccles is a losing move though, if you check karliso vs recurse, recurse often wins/draws as player 2, because karliso uses teccles in a late 20s play move
 MSmits: ply
 MSmits: i solved this move as a loss
 BlaiseEbuth: That's true. And probably THE worse. Pretty proud of that.
 darkhorse64: evil mod
 ErrorRazor: Othello boss timed out&#160;:&gt;
 jacek: who made it!?!?!?
 darkhorse64: don't know
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: :japanese_ogre:
 Westicles: Is the MILA clobber code published?  Be interesting to see how it does against you guys
 darkhorse64: won't fix if it does not happen too often
 ErrorRazor: First time I've seen it happen
 ErrorRazor: Usually I'm the one timing out
 Astrobytes: oh it was played as an 8x8 I see  Westicles
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: It's rare
 darkhorse64: I usually don't have safety margins: I search full time 
 Astrobytes: Ahh, there I go, back to my safe place at the bottom of Clobber Wood 1. The balance is restored!

 struct: "GameMaster 2.0 is an abstract board-game playing computer environment. It plays LOA, Breakthrough, Clobber, Domineering, Knightthrough, and Surakarta."
 struct: Not sure if the code is public though
 ZarthaxX: holy f
 Westicles: Looks like it is just an executable
 Astrobytes: there are java decompilers
 ZarthaxX: mcts-minmax hybrid papers too
 AntiSquid: sounds like some generalized ML 
 Astrobytes: Also, UnnamedCodinGamer, Rémi Coulom is also on this site (CG that is)
 jacek: quite old. before that nn hype
 Astrobytes: Crazy_Remi = Rémi Coulom
 UnnamedCodinGamer: who is he?
 Astrobytes: Uh, he invented MCTS for starters&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: NLP goes very far back, not necessarily NN indeed
 MSmits: he's on the D&amp;B leaderboard. Miklla beat him though (i did by a small margin as well)
 Astrobytes: Nice! I hope he gets into some other games
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think I have come across the referred as originator MCTS paper from 2006 I think
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do not remember his name
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I might be wrong
 Astrobytes: "In 2006, inspired by these predecessors, Rémi Coulom described the application of the Monte Carlo method to game-tree search and coined the name Monte Carlo tree search"
 UnnamedCodinGamer: really nice 
 Astrobytes: Incorporation of the UCB formula was later, but still. The guy's a legend
 jacek: remi, winands and Teytaud are common names in mcts papers
 Astrobytes: Very strong Go engine too
 Astrobytes: Yes jacek
 struct: I skip the name part
 AntiSquid: ya same
 AntiSquid: but maybe worth keeping track who writes the good papers :P
 jacek: there are many references
 Astrobytes: You would do well to look at names so you can read the references.
 AntiSquid: he gets a lot of citations&#160;?
 jacek: you read paper and see [name, 2009]
 Astrobytes: They all do. Read the names and check the references that are in every paper&#160;:|
 Astrobytes: *every paper related to the subjects we speak of
 jacek: i wonder have many cites that aerodynamic paper has
 jacek: dat grammar
 MSmits: you wonder about that paper too much
 Astrobytes: Poor jacek needs some (o)(o) in his life
 therealbeef: an owl?
 MSmits: yes, for the sake of the children, lets assume it's an owl :P
 Astrobytes: I'm no good at these things
 MSmits: :owl:
 Astrobytes: Assume owl for safely
 Astrobytes: *safety
 Astrobytes: Other than that: he needs BREASTS
 Astrobytes: Women, etc etc
 MSmits: ah i was going to assume chicken next, protein etc.
 therealbeef: what are the etc etc?
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: He's into anime and catgirls
 MSmits: ponies
 Astrobytes: Hence the etc
 jacek: who isnt?
 Astrobytes: Aaaaand the ponies
 Astrobytes: I'm not into anime. Or ponies.
 Astrobytes: Catgirls...
 Scarfield: to each their own
 jacek: you have cat avatar
 MSmits: and she is a girl
 Astrobytes: Both of my cats are
 Scarfield: and you say you are not into them :thinking:
 Astrobytes: That doesn't mean I'm into human-woman-cat hybrids
 AntiSquid: they can wear a costume
 Astrobytes: They might be aesthetically pleasing, they might not. Either way they'd be fking terrifying
 Scarfield: meh frog girls are where its at
 AntiSquid: hybrids are creepy
 Astrobytes: Elon can take his cat girls to MArs
 Scarfield: he likes car girls?
 AntiSquid: elon is playing along with the memes for popularity
 Scarfield: cat *
 MSmits: probably car also
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: someone joked about elon creating cat-girls and then elon reacted that it's an interesting idea, forgot exact story
 AntiSquid: he already sent a tesla roadster to space MSmits, but you probably already know about it
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: do you mean a toaster?
 AntiSquid: oh
 ErrorRazor: Lmao
 AntiSquid: no, a car
 MSmits: that doesnt make sense
 MSmits: space has no roads
 AntiSquid: it does if you look at the story behind it
 MSmits: ok
 AntiSquid: well it achieved multiple things
 AntiSquid: including advertising
 AntiSquid: point was to send a heavy load into space and prove his rockets can deliver this task
 MSmits: I see
 AntiSquid: so he used one of his cars to advertise ...
 Nachosauce: Or maybe space is one large road
 Scarfield: road theory
 AntiSquid: oh and it was orbiting Mars at some point MSmits, comon you should know Mars' satelites
 MSmits: phobos and deimos
 AntiSquid: and tesla roadster
 AntiSquid: for a while

 AntiSquid: Nachosaucehttps://ultimatemotorcycling.com/2015/03/02/motorcycle-squid-on-the-rise-join-the-anti-squid-movement/ read this @_@
 MSmits: dont trigger him about the motorcycle thing
 Scarfield: you seem impressively unimpressed smitsi&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's not very scientific
 AntiSquid: until&#160;! an alien species finds it, equips it with AI and fancy gadgets and the car returns to earth looking for its master next millennia 
 AntiSquid: referencing star trek here, voyager returned to earth on its own :P
 Astrobytes: I sent a heavy load into space once, that was a great night, she was... I never did find it in the morning anyway so I assume it went to space ...
 MSmits: I'm thinking first contact will be a traffic accident&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: tunguska style&#160;?
 AntiSquid: not saying it was aliens, could be a car equiped with AI from another civilization
 MSmits: that's just a meteorite :P
 struct: The car is still travelling right?
 therealbeef: the squid article mentions 'google+', so quaint
 AntiSquid: yes, don't think it hit anything, maybe he should have mounted a satellite on the back of the car?
 Astrobytes: Wait til it collides with my load, AB2014
 Astrobytes: Anyway, without further innuendo I shall say goodnight
 AntiSquid: do you know about starlink btw?
 ZarthaxX: cya astro :P
 AntiSquid: gn8
 MSmits: gn
 struct: gn
 Scarfield: gn

 MSmits: btw, if anyone is interested in the teccles fail at ply 28 for karliso vs recurse. I just reproduced it in IDE and got solved status from my meta mcts
 struct: "easy to beat"
 UnnamedCodinGamer: is he saying that he used alpha zero?
 struct: he is saying it doesnt work
 struct: for d&amp;b
 MSmits: it really doesn't
 MSmits: also hard to use NN, but not impossible ofc. NN can do anything, but might be too constrained in CG
 UnnamedCodinGamer: then it is not clear what he used 
 MSmits: he used some form of nimstring analysis
 MSmits: like mikkla and I do
 MSmits: it's the most math-y game on CG
 MSmits: have to get into combinatorial theory
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, he mentions it in the reply to the question
 MSmits: clobber uses some of this too, but it's less critical there
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: i cant read the reply, no twitter account
 struct: "Dots and boxes is not a game where you build an intuition of who is ahead. You have to calculate exactly. And it is a combinatorial game. It may be possible to make AlphaZero work with the right network architecture, but I have not found it."
 struct: You dont need a twitter account 
 MSmits: ah ok, yes
 MSmits: thats it, you do have to calculate exactly
 MSmits: any infinitesimal error in a "rough eval" would completely turn the game around
 MSmits: it's in permanent zugzwang
 MSmits: the only feature you could evaluate is whomevers turn it is basically
 MSmits: even the score is useless, because the score has no bearing on what the best move is
 MSmits: you can supposedly count chains and get a likelyhood that you will end up ahead, but it's basically a halfassed nimstring analysis

 struct: MSmits do you think NN would work on STC?
 AntiSquid: why would it not struct&#160;?
 struct: I think it should
 AntiSquid: i am assuming #1 on stc is NN
 AntiSquid: #clash EmbeddedIs77
 MSmits: it might be a bit complicated. the interaction between player and opponent is weird in stc
 MSmits: same as with hypersonic. If you use a NN there, you lose the powerful beam search that ignores opponent
 MSmits: using a NN in boardgames is just different
 MSmits: might be that it's useful to use a NN partially, in a bot. Do some parts with pure math or brute force and do other parts with NN
 Kyuujin: hello to night coders
 Nick_Svaki: the problem description is hard to understand.
 ZarthaxX: which one Nick_Svaki?
 Nick_Svaki: I don't know how to seek the problem that I can't solve.
 ZarthaxX: what problem is it

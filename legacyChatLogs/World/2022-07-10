 gokubill: hi 
 jacek: oO
 gokubill: spam spam =]]
 Zorg1: nice gn spam&#160;;-)
 aCat: morning
 aCat: (late morning I mean ;p)
 j4at: morning
 jacek: j4at overnight training brought me to 6th :tada:
 j4at: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: for me the night brought me to 10th already
 putibuzu: gz
 jacek: bz2
 MSmits: lol, this submti
 MSmits: submit
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>
 MSmits: if i spam this bot, jacek is 2nd and robo goes out of the top 10
 jacek: spam plx
 MSmits: hehe sorry, just experimenting. I think this is a good one, but it's hard to say when most of its rating comes from bashing robo
 jacek: good enough
 MSmits: I've had one before that did the same to you. I wonder if that one was better 
 jacek: im at the about its 100% win against my test bots <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/xXsANfw.png">https://i.imgur.com/xXsANfw.png</a>
 jacek: its improving but i cant see it anymore
 MSmits: looks good
 jacek: at the point*
 MSmits: make more testbots
 jacek: i think i can get to top3 with those inputs. i thought using inputs for the whole board would be required
 MSmits: i can't comment on that, i havent tried to understand the game yet
 jacek: i dont understand that game either ~
 MSmits: right, but if i did, i could help you maybe. Too busy with crosses and circles though
 IonutH: hi. what happens if I submit my code  with 0% result in Clash of Code? How does affect my rank? What if others do the same in a game? Do I have an advantage if I do it fist, meaning to give up?
 jacek: its based on rank. if youre 1st with 0% then you win
 jacek: or if shortest, 0% with 0 bytes wins i think
 Thorcode: 0 bytes in shortest lose
 jacek: oh
 IonutH: thank you for answers
 Thorcode: you must type a letter
 Thorcode: if you give up
 MSmits: an apology letter?
 Thorcode: in shortest if you give you just delete all and type an letter
 jacek: thats short for sure
 IonutH: oh nice hint
 MSmits: err, it's better just to not lose&#160;:)
 Thorcode: it give you a chance to win
 MSmits: I guess
 j4at: jacek what hardware are you using for training?
 MSmits: he's using a chromebook :P
 j4at: yeah, probably :p
 jacek: cpu ryzen 7 5800X. i have 2060 gpu but i didnt managed to make it work to my needs yet
 j4at: my dude have a gpu and using the cpu instead :p
 jacek: :shrug:
 DomiKo: j4cat gpu is useless 
 DomiKo: trust me
 j4at: no its not
 DomiKo: yes it is
 j4at: it speeds training a lot
 DomiKo: not really 
 j4at: huh&#160;????
 DomiKo: its speeds when you network is big
 jacek: maybe for big deep nets
 j4at: use  a big batch size
 j4at: problem fixed&#160;:)
 DomiKo: but for small networks cost of transfering memory from CPU to GPU is much higher then rest
 DomiKo: no
 DomiKo: it's not about batch size
 j4at: you do'nt need to transfer it tho
 jacek: + big batch size leads to poorer training
 DomiKo: true
 RafIntalian: Hello everyone
 j4at: well it really depends
 MSmits: hello RafIntalian
 j4at: for exemple openai is using 2million batchsize for gpt3 :p
 j4at: There is some tricks to make larger batchsize better
 jacek: jax or evojax looks promising for many small nets
 MSmits: jax? shortened from jacek?
 j4at: I'm using 512 batchsize for my search race
 MSmits: jaxmax
 DomiKo: 512 is not much, but when you have many millions of samples, you can't fit them into GPU, so you have to transfer
 j4at: heh&#160;? you said small neural networks
 DomiKo: network is small, but you have many samples
 j4at: That is not costly really
 j4at: I keep all samples in the CPU
 DomiKo: transferring the memory?
 j4at: transferring samples yes
 j4at: because we are not dealing with images here
 DomiKo: images?
 DomiKo: for me memory transfer is around 80% of the whole GPU time
 j4at: maybe you are doing it wrong
 jacek: plug your gpu closer to ram
 DomiKo: PyTorch lighting is doing everything for me
 DomiKo: so I can't really do something wrong
 MSmits: lighting? I thought it was for training NN
 j4at: maybe your gpu is connected to psu x1 or something
 j4at: lmao
 DomiKo: MSmits yeah lighting
 MSmits: I guess usually training NN gives heat, but I guess pytorch is different
 MSmits: is it natural light? Or more like LED?
 jacek: its optical computer
 DomiKo: xD
 DomiKo: it's lighting fast! 
 MSmits: I am starting to get the sense you mean lightning?
 DomiKo: ohh yeah
 j4at: did a test. in gpu it takes .05s for every "iteration" (training 4 nns) and in cpu it takes 1s even if i made it train 1/2 nns it will still be faster
 j4at: Maybe you have gtx 1030
 j4at: or using an igpu
 j4at: with 2 nn it takes .025s proving that data transfer almost takes no time in this case
 putibuzu: how large are the NNs?
 j4at: Well its hard to explain. I will make them even smaller
 putibuzu: what data is being transferred here? training samples? and the weights are already stored in GPU memory?
 j4at: yes
 putibuzu: ok thanks&#160;:) I was always wondering how people make use of GPU for training
 putibuzu: to clarify do you use the GPU for forward pass as well?
 j4at: i use gpu foreverything yes&#160;:)
 jacek: to make coffee as well?
 j4at: yeah i use the extra heat :p
 putibuzu: ok then you basically only have to transfer the weights at the beginning of training and when writing to disk right? and the weights are modified during training in the GPU memory
 MSmits: and can it do lighting like DomiKo's&#160;?
 j4at: putibuzu The weights gets initialized directly in the GPU
 putibuzu: j4at alright thanks!
 j4at: They are critic nns so they don't need to fit in cg because i'm using the actors. But even when i made them small enough to fit in cg.  gpu takes .01s and cpu .06s
 MSmits: will it use the same amount of energy in total, to train the NN? 
 j4at: less energy
 MSmits: hmm 
 j4at: because gpu is more energy efficient
 jacek: if you managed to work with your gpu, fine. i didnt
 j4at: and when I train it on small nns like this it uses like 10% of its power
 j4at: With  pytorch/keras its pretty easy
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/450/824/6a8.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/450/824/6a8.jpg</a>
 MSmits: is that shaggy?
 j4at: I didn't use mixed-precision either with mixed-precision you can get 2x the speed
 jacek: MSmits yes
 MSmits: 495 submits in uttt
 jacek: ban :hammer:
 MSmits: (over 4 yrs)
 DomiKo: j4cat
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y7a0_ovqgtNDikXKr4rapEqJFlQ1Ksde?usp=sharing">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y7a0_ovqgtNDikXKr4rapEqJFlQ1Ksde?usp=sharing</a>
 DomiKo: simple example where cpu = gpu
 j4at: colab gpus are trash
 j4at: they are randomly choosen
 DomiKo: cpu are too
 j4at: you can get a good gpu or a very slow one
 j4at: do the same test in kaggle
 j4at: and send me the results :p
 DomiKo: even in simple test when I move whole data set to cuda and then train, it takes 1s less (from 8s) 
 DomiKo: so yeah that proves my point that transferring that is very costly
 DomiKo: and I never used kaggle, so I can't do it
 j4at: That model is less than 40k weights half my nns size. I will test it on my computer and send results
 DomiKo: it was just a simple test
 j4at: well, I timed only the training not moving the model too. And the results are 4.96s in gpu and 5.87s in cpu. 512 inputs is more than my 112 input and my model is 2 times bigger.
 j4at: also you are using 1 core to load the data
 j4at: I will try using all cores
 j4at: 3.9s in gpu and 4.45s in cpu
 DomiKo: still pretty close and have have new GPU
 DomiKo: " 512 inputs is more than my 112 input and my model is 2 times bigger." as I sad it's just a simple example
 DomiKo: I just typed some random numbers
 DomiKo: but especially with one hot inputs, you can have huge input layer compared to the model size
 j4at: Did some optimizations and now its 3.78s, yeah maybe you are kinda correct DomiKo gpu is only 2 times faster than cpu in this case even after I increasesd the size to 80k weights
 j4at: without changing input size
 DomiKo: and with CPU you can train in parallel 
 j4at: IN gpu too
 j4at: atleast using pytorch
 j4at: but for actor critic gpu is a lot faster. Because you have 2 nns + you can make the critic as big as you want
 jacek: youre so critical
 j4at: + if you use attention or cnns other other fancy operations cpu takes a lot a lot longer
 DomiKo: yes it would
 j4at: "have new GPU" Domiko I have gtx 1080 so I don't have tensor core&#160;:'( I rent gpu's online&#160;:'(
 DomiKo: :cry:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>   This version is a NN-buster. only robo unscathed
 MSmits: it's funny that when you have enough different versions, you can just decide who is nr 1-2-3
 jacek: one man shall not have that much power
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: could have kicked recurse out of top 10 with that too
 DomiKo: LOL
 MSmits: 17 W / 6 L
 MSmits: 1 D
 MSmits: if I had more random in my bot this would not have been an option. The fixed eval and no random rollouts really makes this happen
 MSmits: i should keep a library of such bots for each arena and then when someone annoys me, I'll submit my destroyer bot for that specific person :P
 MSmits: it's evil
 j4at: jokes on you my bots are not good enough to reach the top.
 putibuzu: :D 
 MSmits: lol
 DomiKo: MSmits so you will be like an ultimate mod?
 Aldoggen: the Great Mod
 Aldoggen: aka God
 MSmits: sure why not&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's weird, because my bot is not strong enough to get nr 1. 4 at most, if i am lucky. 
 j4at: Can i join your cult&#160;?
 MSmits: sure
 j4at:&#160;:)
 DomiKo: MSmits 4th is still impresive 
 DomiKo: and it really shows how strong karliso is 
 MSmits: Yeah
 MSmits: personally I think he is the best bot on the board. I can make versions that beat any NN, but i cant do the same for karliso. His bot is more random
 jacek: should i put more random
 jacek: :imp:
 MSmits: you could, but it might make your bot weaker
 jacek: as long as its anti-MSmits
 MSmits: mmh it wont help that much, when i wreck robo or recurse, it is by a lot. Yours already does reasonably well
 MSmits: because you already have the random
 MSmits: my bot is also just around your bots rating, similar strength. without any RPS
 MSmits: I think yours is a little bit stronger
 MSmits: oh and wait till you start experimenting with anti-msmits stuff. I should be done fitting params after today. I'll be generating a book after that, but that takes weeks
 struct: NNs are over rated I knew it
 jacek: referee should tell you opponent's name. that would make things easier
 MSmits: so true
 MSmits: it would be funny if your bot could read opponent msg output
 MSmits: identify opponent that way
 MSmits: well, there sometimes is a way, if you want to go that far. In many games, the top bots have a specific but different first few moves. You could detect them that way
 MSmits: I never did that personally
 MSmits: doesnt work on onitama and such of course
 j4at: download top 20 players games and train a NN to identify the player
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: thats some meta machine learning
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://maiachess.com/">https://maiachess.com/</a>
 StevenV: hello guys
 MSmits: jacek now make a chess engine that plays like a monkey
 struct: Maybe they can play chess
 MSmits: they can play some games
 MSmits: I don't think banana-motivation is enough to get it to learn the rules of the game
 StevenV: I am gonna learn kotlin, is it good for COC?
 eulerscheZahl: no. but that's a strange priority to learn or not to learn a langauge anyways
 struct: I dont think so
 struct: MSmits have you ever seen them doing chimp test?
 jacek: kotlin compiler is slow here and might even timeout
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#Actual_monkeys">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#Actual_monkeys</a>
 j4at: StevenV try vb.net jacek recommended it to me.
 StevenV: I am an experienced Java dev, that's why I want to learn Kotlin...
 MSmits: i saw some stuff, not sure if i saw that struct
 j4at: hehe&#160;:)
 jacek: try fortran or cobol. much future
 StevenV:&#160;:(
 jacek: kotlin is fine. its just weird for clashes
 DomiKo: for clashes everything should be fine, except shortest... 
 StevenV: thanks guys, I guess I just use kotlin to solve puzzles then
 j4at: yeah only shortest... fastest and reversed&#160;:)
 Thorcode: using clash to learn new language
 Thorcode: clash is good to learn new language
 MSmits: made it to 3&#160;:)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>
 MSmits: all NN's matched or busted&#160;:)
 Thorcode: cool
 MSmits: damn that karliso though =)
 Thorcode: just made it to bronze
 Thorcode: that tic tac toe game is hard
 Thorcode: due to changing board
 MSmits: yes, its a huge change
 MSmits: i would have preferred some leagues where the normal TTT boss just becomes better
 Thorcode: through wood ez
 Thorcode: but bronze like a lot of pain
 MSmits: the simulation is still quite simple though
 MSmits: it's just hard to know what is a good move
 Thorcode: sometime
 MSmits: i have been toying with the idea of making a new UTTT contribution with better TTT leagues and final league has steal as an option
 Thorcode: I could get to bronze by brute force
 MSmits: then you dont need mirror matches either
 Thorcode: oh that's seem fun
 MSmits: I never made a game before though, on CG
 MSmits: and have to find the time
 miszu: Hey all, are there any competition where it's all based on heuristics and none on wiriting bulletproof simulation and engine?
 MSmits: you mean bot arena's?
 MSmits: yes plenty
 miszu: yeah
 MSmits: code a la mode is closest to an all-heuristics competition
 miszu: I find it teadious writing an engine.
 miszu: I just want to read the inputs and do the best heuristic
 MSmits: as for tedious, my code a la mode bot had 3k lines :P
 miszu: bruuh
 Thorcode: how
 MSmits: i did have search but, so many ifs
 MSmits: over 300+
 MSmits: you did ask for heuristic arena's
 miszu: I know
 MSmits: means many ifs
 MSmits: = much code
 miszu: as long as I don't need to sims
 MSmits: the winner didnt have sim
 MSmits: of the contest that is
 MSmits: python winner
 MSmits: I ended 8th with beamsearch
 miszu: so I can get to play with just heuristic?
 MSmits: i was an exception, most did not use search
 miszu: plat*
 miszu: I mean legendary lol
 MSmits: easily
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: write good heuristics :0
 miszu: I will :0
 MSmits: and pick up my damn plate
 MSmits: :rage:
 Thorcode: brute force
 miszu: Don't tell me what to do
 miszu: I am an unionized coder
 miszu: we have rights
 MSmits: miszu in the contest i would put down finished plates, that had to be carried to the dropoff and when the other bot was closer, i would attempt to pass it to them
 MSmits: but i got ignored a lot
 MSmits: (it's a cooperative arena)
 miszu: Interesting
 miszu: I will have a try then
 MSmits: it's really fun imho
 Thorcode: gotta learn something new
 Thorcode: bye
 MSmits: bye Thorcode
 miszu: I was doing coding royale but when I saw to go to legendary you need to write a buggy sim and engine...
 miszu: I was like life is too short for that
 MSmits: heh i can get that
 MSmits: sims for simple boardgames are not a lot of work though
 miszu: yeah that's fine
 miszu: but like the pod racing?
 MSmits: yeah thats work
 MSmits: and there are worse ones
 miszu: the fun part is the heuristics
 MSmits: sometimes it's fun
 MSmits: sometimes i just dont know what to use
 MSmits: last contest i didnt know
 MSmits: i just bruteforced my own turn and got to legend that way
 miszu: I wish we could do a manual mode where you just play the game yourself
 MSmits: yeah that would be fun
 MSmits: jacek, good news, you rank above recurse and are still 4th
 HenroLST: morning
 MSmits: I'm done fitting params, so if you want, mess around to create anti-smits, but you'll push recurse back up, that's the price
 MSmits: morning HenroLST
 HenroLST: geez how are you guys always awake and coding
 HenroLST: are you like lucid dreaming just to code in your sleep too???
 MSmits: only during contests
 MSmits: this is me relax-coding
 HenroLST: dang
 HenroLST: ok i need to up my game then :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: just enjoy and you'll code more
 HenroLST: yup
 HenroLST: wait just out of curiosity can you make a NN in c++?
 MSmits: you can make a NN in anything
 HenroLST: ooo something to look forward to in the future then
 MSmits: generally it is easier to use one of those python frameworks you can find 
 MSmits: you can also export the weights you get with those and then use them in a c++ bot
 MSmits: thats what many do on CG
 HenroLST: ah
 HenroLST: or just grab from stack overflow :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 MSmits: but in the end a NN is just a program, so it's not language specific
 Illedan: During offline training. Is it better to test against a constant population or create a new population to do round robin against each round?
 MSmits: for testing probably better to have constant set of bots
 MSmits: otherwise how will you know you improved
 Illedan: Yeah, I'm getting stuck on that thought now :thinking:
 Illedan: So I need to figure out how to make a good variety of bots :D
 jacek: that was my problem in green circle
 jacek: later i used bots trained with different hyperparams for testing
 jacek: at the beginning i was testing against random and the 1st action bot only
 jacek: maybe if i knew the game i'd make some simple heuristic bot as well
 Illedan: Now I'm creating a new population of 4 new mutated bots + the best from the prev round. Then doing 20 games between all pairs (80 games for each)
 D4WEED: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: This is for FB
 jacek: NN? :scream:
 Illedan: Nah, GA hyper param training
 Illedan: Could put them through some NN though
 jacek: im doing pure round robin, coevolution for clash of bots. i just ran out of testing bots, its 100% wins against all of them now
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/VBecERg.png">https://i.imgur.com/VBecERg.png</a>
 HenroLST: bot
 Illedan: I'll change to a population of 2 and just save all the new best mutations. To get a validation population
 jacek: sounds incest
 Illedan: My newly trained IAs have dropped re Curse 2 points since yesterday. So soon I can have hopes of being first :eyes:
 jacek: so incest is wincest?
 Illedan: Only the good kind of incest
 HenroLST: ...
 MSmits: jeez, I am away from the computer for 1  second...
 Illedan: Hm, I'm talking about my GA genomes
 MSmits: o
 jacek: and youre inbreeding them
 HenroLST: imagine reCurse comes back just to win that particular event
 struct: he is retired
 Illedan: Did he say?
 Illedan: Or just asumptions?
 struct: it says on his CG profile
 struct: retired from CG
 Astrobytes: and he did say he was done
 Illedan: I guess his last contest win was enough to prove everything
 struct: I guess I'll never retire
 jacek: he said not-first in contest or retire
 karliso: MSmits wow, look at you, what have you done to uttt leaderboard?
 Astrobytes: probably concentrating on chess, and little recurs e too of course
 struct: karliso his bot is now eval instead of rollout
 karliso: yeah, I wonder how hard it is to come up with good eval.. or just that noone gave it serious try.
 Illedan: 1 random move and then eval all the way?
 struct: eval on expansion Illedan
 Illedan: Which is?
 struct: MCTS select expandon expansion when you create a node you eval it
 struct: instead of doing a rollout
 Illedan: And then do rollouts afterwards?
 struct: yeah no rollout
 struct: just eval straight away
 MSmits: karliso yeah i messed it up&#160;:)
 struct: Am I right MSmits?
 Illedan: I don't quite understand
 MSmits: yes struct
 MSmits: just dont do the random rollout in mcts
 MSmits: replace it with eval score
 MSmits: and backpropagate that also
 Illedan: Ok, so you the rollout to some depth?
 Illedan: And then eval instead?
 Illedan: *you do the
 MSmits: my depth for this is 0
 MSmits: i expand, then eval immediately
 Illedan: So it is instant?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: selection -&gt; expansion -&gt; eval
 Illedan: Done in 1 ms?
 MSmits: eh no i do this 100k times per turn :P
 struct: he does normal mcts just no rollout
 Illedan: hmm
 MSmits: to be clear, 142k on 2nd turn
 jacek: jacekmax or mcts?
 MSmits: eval is pretty expensive
 MSmits: not jackemax no
 MSmits: I dont know how that would do
 Illedan: Got any documentation that I can read?
 MSmits: nope, but it really isnt complicated. Imagine a normal mcts
 DomiKo: MSmits with eval you have more itererations?
 MSmits: at some point you have a line that says score = Simulation ()
 MSmits: replace that with
 MSmits: score = Evaluation(0
 jacek: mcts early playout termination, though they play for N random moves, then eval instead of checking win/loss
 MSmits: DomiKo a little more yes
 jacek: more in the beginning but probably less in ending
 MSmits: but the eval contains a lot of ifs and lookups so its not a lot
 karliso: So you normalize eval to -1 1 or equivalent? 
 MSmits: i dont normalize
 MSmits: what i did was, i keep the exploration param at 1.0
 MSmits: and fit the other parameters to something that works
 jacek: would switching to rollouts from late midgame be better?
 MSmits: it could totally be the case that there are regions in the game where rollout is better or eval is better
 MSmits: karliso the working params are such that the scores more or less fall into the same range. Sometimes they go at most to -2 or +3 or something
 MSmits: btw, it was not hard to make an eval that gets into top 100 for uttt. a simple eval that makes sense will get you there. A good eval is harder
 karliso: How long did it take for you?
 MSmits: i had this bot from a year ago, i worked on it then a week or so, but i gave up to soon. I picked it up now and improved it in a few days
 MSmits: the other bot was ranked around 15th
 MSmits: (the earlier eval bot i mean, mcts was ranked 8)
 MSmits: 8 lol... damn emotes
 MSmits: but just the fact that a neural network can be trained to eval uttt should tell you it's possible. 
 karliso: But beating NN is a different thing.
 MSmits: i am not sure it is an entirely fair comparison. I suspect if you look at the games, they are often the same game
 MSmits: if i change 1 param by 0.1, suddenly recurse wrecks me, or robo does
 MSmits: if both bots do not use random, it can get kind of boring
 MSmits: but the bot does well vs other bots too, so i wont complain
 jacek: :rage:
 jacek: im so happy for you
 MSmits: I can tell :P
 MSmits: dont worry, i am sure i'll get pulled back down when the other top 10 bots resubmit.
 MSmits: the nn's tend to do better vs random bots
 MSmits: vingte, tomatoes or yurko can ruin my day
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>
 MSmits: i will not get much better than 50% and the NN's will much more
 _NikJ: Now, what I'M wondering is, what kind of magic did reCurse cast in order to get such an insanely high score in mad pod racing?His win ratio is like 96% lol
 jacek: we may never know
 MSmits: _NikJ mad pod racing is kind of strange in that sense though. If 1 bot is better than another, even if only a little, they quickly get 100% wr
 MSmits: only a small margin in bot strength is necessary to get very high WR
 MSmits: the same margin in uttt would get you maybe 55%
 putibuzu: MSmits what techniques do you use for parameter fitting? 
 MSmits: crap techniques
 MSmits: i tried first locally playing vs my normal mcts bot
 MSmits: i figured it wouldn't overfit but it eventually did. It would even wreck my mcts both with 500 ms calc time
 MSmits: so then i just tried stuff on the leaderboard
 MSmits: (submit)
 MSmits: thankfully I only have a few params now
 MSmits: I think 3 main ones, the other ones are pretty basic and can be independently fitted (similar to exploration param)
 MSmits: for example, I have a mobility param, that subtracts from the score. childCount * param
 MSmits: that doesnt really depend on anything else I think, so i just fitted it once
 MSmits: (it's bad to give your opponent more choices)
 putibuzu: ah ok thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: if i had to do it better, i would probably do a GA. I should make a frame work for it
 MSmits: it would be nice to have one for next contest
 MSmits: where you just plug in your bot with the ability to pass param value and then the framework starts them fighting
 putibuzu: hat sounds interesting :thinking:
 putibuzu: *that
 MSmits: yeah i think there are some ways like that, but GA is fairly simple and works well. I just haven't done it yet
 putibuzu: Alright thanks&#160;:) I'm looking forward to you taking #1&#160;:)
 MSmits: not by fiddling more params, but i am generating an opening book. That should help
 MSmits: I am not counterbooking though
 jacek: books :unamused:
 MSmits: I am not feeling guilty for using them when others spend days locally training their NN and filling their codesize with weights&#160;:)
 MSmits: counterbook is cheesy though
 TimeEngineer: :joy:
 Illedan: I wonder if I can get into UTTT legend by only using books?
 MSmits: books are really weak in uttt, there are better games to use them
 MSmits: problem is that there are many ways to play well, so there's many plays to counter
 MSmits: game winning/losing mistakes happen somewhere between ply 18 and 30 for good bots
 MSmits: and books dont usually go that deep
 MSmits: I am just hoping for a few&#160;% WR from them
 Illedan: How many moves can you fit in a book?
 MSmits: depends on the game
 Illedan: UTTT ofc
 Illedan: I know it depends :P
 jacek: not many transpositions there
 MSmits: i am thinking
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: probably around 200k
 MSmits: but you'd need to minify your code to a negligible amount or it'll be less
 MSmits: i have never hit the limit though
 Illedan: Maybe I'll try for UTTT
 Illedan: See if pure lookup can go to Legend :D
 Illedan: Can't do anything while FB is training locally
 MSmits: well, you wont be able to do pure lookup. Still need some heuristics to finish off
 Illedan: Nah ^^
 MSmits: you wont be able to finish a single game just with lookups :P
 TimeEngineer: What's difference between Qtable and books&#160;?
 MSmits: it's the same thing i guess
 TimeEngineer: I see
 MSmits: Qtable stores states with actions right?
 TimeEngineer: Yes
 MSmits: yeah same thing
 MSmits: I dont store the states though
 MSmits: just the moves, in a tree starting from the root
 MSmits: moves are much smaller than the whole game state
 jacek: how do you deal with transpositions
 TimeEngineer: That's the question
 MSmits: I deal with it locally. 
 MSmits: I don't generate moves in the tree that are duplicate
 TimeEngineer: Many actions can lead to the same state
 MSmits: if it hits a gamestate i find in another branch, then it ends there, as a leaf
 MSmits: locally when generating book, i take into account rotations, but also other kinds of transpositions
 MSmits: when in my bot, i need to lookup a move, I try all rotations of the current state, to see if it matches with a state from the book
 TimeEngineer: Do you use NN for UTTT jacek&#160;? if so you used a CNN&#160;? I'm wondering because of rotation invariance
 jacek: i use NN, but good old one-hots
 jacek: i just add rotations to training positions
 MSmits: did you do the inside-out transposition for nmm?
 jacek: the what
 MSmits: switch the inner ring with the outer ring
 MSmits: it has 16 ways to transform the board
 TimeEngineer: What XD&#160;?
 MSmits: nine mens morris
 jacek: no, just rotations and symmetries
 TimeEngineer: Ah it's another game :p
 MSmits: ahh thats sad jacek, could have doubled your training states =)
 jacek: i have no motivation, im still 1st&#160;:(
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: TimeEngineer uttt has 8 symmetries,  yavalath has 12 and nmm has 16, it is kind of special that way
 MSmits: besides it being bitboardable with only 24 bits per player
 TimeEngineer: I have never played others game
 MSmits: which game have you played?
 TimeEngineer: UTTT only
 MSmits: ohh ok
 jacek: not even green circle?
 TimeEngineer: And I learned the rules yesterday
 MSmits: tons of interesting board games here
 TimeEngineer: Among what he says
 TimeEngineer: Yes I played GC ofc
 TimeEngineer: I used UTTT to learn NN from scratch but I don't really like them :p
 MSmits: uttt is not a good starting place for nn afaik
 TimeEngineer: What's the best place then&#160;?
 jacek: oware
 MSmits: oware probably
 MSmits: gotta go for a bit, garden work
 jacek: its just quite recently NN took over UTTT
 TimeEngineer: See you
 MSmits: ttyl
 jacek: even recurse had problems with them most of the time
 TimeEngineer: Why is he so popular&#160;?
 MSmits: thats not the right word to use
 TimeEngineer: Why even him&#160;?
 MSmits: he's just very very good
 Illedan: 1 more very needed
 MSmits: allright going to pull some weeds now
 Illedan: gl
 Astrobytes: "weeds" eh
 jacek: in holand :thinking:
 Astrobytes: :D
 Passifi: wooo wooo  wooo I did it I finally solved Labyrinth woooo the dopamin rush, the joy .... and its gone :upside_down: next puzzle&#160;;)
 jacek: space maze?
 eulerscheZahl: bender 4
 jacek: galaxy labyrinth?
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-labyrinth">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-labyrinth</a>
 eulerscheZahl: we know the puzzle
 Passifi: okay I thought there was ambiguity&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: suggestions for your next one
 Passifi: always appreciated yes
 eulerscheZahl: there are more mazes to solve
 Passifi: oh I see I know see the space maze puzzle in the very hard section I was confused here for a minute and bender 4 is another maze one&#160;?

 PatrickMcGinnisII: CTTT
 jacek: ezpz
 DomiKo: gz gz
 jacek: bz2 even
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey hey! use my starter go legend. ezpz
 geppoz: Passifi try this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-fall-episode-3">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-fall-episode-3</a>

 PatrickMcGinnisII: 63rd, ok
 Illedan: Nice jacek. Do you NN consider all inputs together? Or only 1 robot?
 jacek: only 1 robot. + number of robots and rounds
 Illedan: Nice
 jacek: i thought for top5 i would need all of them, but its not needed apparently
 j4at: Jacek are you going to try all robots&#160;? 
 jacek: nah, at least not now
 Illedan: Try 2 and 2?
 jacek: hm?
 Illedan: Give output for all robots seen by 1 robot
 Illedan: Then do this for all robots
 Illedan: and use the sum of actions as a vote for each of them
 Illedan: Then do the best
 jacek: oO
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Only 4 moves + defend + 4 attack right?
 Illedan: + selfdestruct
 jacek: 10 moves
 Illedan: 250 outputs then
 jacek: quite lately it realized selfdestruct can be useful sometimes
 DomiKo: selfplay?
 jacek: you could say that, yes
 j4at: I'm going to do all robots + rnn :neutral_face:
 jacek: thats the spirit
 a-Rye:  Whoo! I am the tallest midget! Err, dwarf, vertically challenged, whatever the PC version is. I'm top for "Popular" on the Playgrounds lol. Not top coder, not even top explainer, just top popularity of tutorial, most likely accounting for uptime, but I'll take it!
 jacek: oO
 k4ng0u: a-Rye (not tying to pick up a fight) but whatre are you leading again? I tried to look at a few ranking but never saw you.  what is popular tutorial?
 jacek: i think he means playgrounds and Popular tab
 a-Rye: k4ng0u that's why I joked about being "the tallest midget." I'm ranked fairly average / beginner in most stuff. But my tutorial playground, Beginner Python Concepts, is the most popular. For now, which is why it isn't anything too fancy
 a-Rye: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn?tab=popular">https://www.codingame.com/learn?tab=popular</a>
 a-Rye: First and Fourth actually, but I'm still working on the Java one. I'm also doing an Intermediate soon, but getting some colleagues to possibly collab on it
 jacek: next is Beginner Cobol Concepts
 a-Rye: I wouldn't mind learning that. I have a book on Perl I've been meaning to go through as well...
 jacek: for you own sanity, dont ;o
 a-Rye: Especially just beginner. Anything more, and I'm just posing lol
 a-Rye: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 a-Rye: A lot of that eh? ^^
 HenroLST: magic!

 Westicles: funny that a russian born woman and a soviet born man won wimbledon
 HenroLST: hehe i was hoping krygios would win just to see the upheaval
 HenroLST: also interesting to see if his attitude would change
 TomAlard: what happened to recurse's uttt bot
 TomAlard: 1-&gt;6 lol
 DomiKo: MSmits happend
 HenroLST: sheesh
 jacek: everything changed when the fire nation attacke
 jacek: d
 Evran: hello world
 smhb: 👋
 Westicles: something changed
 jacek: the multiverse is shattering again
 HenroLST: oh no
 miszu: question for the code a la mode, what datastructure you used for the string of the dish description?
 miszu: Do you guys tokenize it?
 MACKEYTH: I would. Minimize string processing that way.
 Astrobytes: yeah, tokenized then stored bitwise in an int
 MACKEYTH: The discord is still pretty quiet despite the "chat going away" warning.
 Sweshies: are the servers offline?
 hacker535646: hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii coders
 BabaYagaCELL: Hello man&#160;!
 TimeEngineer: Even with a DQN with 90% WR against random, I can't reach silver (UTTT) lmao
 dianissimo_z: Hi all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 sheeeeeeh: hi sisters&#160;!!!!
 Fierceblood: Are all clashes fastest mode?
 Fierceblood: Or am I on a very unlikely streak?
 TimeEngineer: There are 3 mode, fastest, shortest and reverse
 Fierceblood: Yeah I know, but I always get fastest for some reason
 Fierceblood: :P
 Fierceblood: Again! XD
 hel-makh: same
 User_xin: Today is another day full of hope
 angryPenguin: I got like 6 shortest in a row this afternoon
 TheDoomedClown_155f: Hiiiii

 emergenitro: hello
 emergenitro: whats up
 MACKEYTH: Playing Code a la Mode
 MACKEYTH: Just discovered the source of a whole bunch of forfeits.
 MACKEYTH: If your partner times out or otherwise inactivates, their position gets reported as -1,-1.
 MACKEYTH: I was getting inactivated due to array out of bounds errors when I tried to plot them on the map.

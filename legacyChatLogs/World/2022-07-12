 relimS: testing one two three
 4986733: testing
 4986733: noice. I can use pidgin
 Aldoggen: the sad thing is this chat looks much nicer than pidgin
 Aldoggen: and i don't want to have to add all the emojis myself
 Aldoggen: and coc chats
 Ronanjun: hey
 Ronanjun: yow!
 Aldoggen: yo
 therealbeef: :thinking:
 wlesavo: RIP chat?
 AstroHydes: it's *technically* dead
 Westicles: the site is dead.  won't last 6 months mow
 Westicles: now
 j4at: F
 relimS: the chat is half of my fun when visiting this site
 Westicles: clash is the backbone of this site, and without chat that will die
 relimS: who in there right mind would kill such an important feature
 Westicles: the buyer isn't interested in this part of the acquisition
 relimS: good luck convincing them lol
 relimS: Wikipedia: CodinGame also serves as a recruiting platformAnd they killed the feature that encourage team work.
 Westicles: they shut down the recruiting part when the GET A JOB button went away
 therealbeef: which part was the buyer interested in?
 relimS: I guess so, people can copy and paste code from google for this puzzles.
 relimS: these*
 Westicles: Coderpad wanted devs and to shut down a competitor
 4986733: my tab reloaded so rip web chat for me
 4986733: I can still use pidgin though
 therealbeef: yay capitalism
 4986733: I wonder if someone can read the code before and after the removal of chat and eject html code with a tampermonkey script
 4986733: All traces of web chat isn't erased from the site yet so maybe someone can eject the missing code back?
 Westicles: I tripped over the router cable and lost it
 4986733: that sucks
 AstroHydes: safety first Westicles, trip hazards are not acceptable :P
 4986733: Me: peasants
 4986733: Am I the only one here using pidgin? out of 401 people?
 4986733: 400 people now
 j4at: Oh no I can't trash talk people when I win in a clash. And make execuses when I lose anymore&#160;:'(
 Uljahn: can't ban lvl3 trolls :crying_cat_face:
 Aldoggen: I'm using pidgin. westicles was too at some point
 Westicles: yep.  and even with all this drama my Strirling numbers clash got approved, and now almost nobody can complain about it!
 Aldoggen: I can always send very negative feedback &gt;:)
 j4at: Uljahn yeah lvl3 trolls is a feature not a bug
 Westicles: after the mod bot eats it I can submit it again, that is great fun
 4986733: Me: yes. This is going to work.C: good luck *throw a seg fault*
 4986733: probably because I access memory outside of array buffer
 Aldoggen: well, don't then
 4986733: it is because of fault math equations
 4986733: faulty*
 4986733: ok. No. I am switching to Python for this puzzle
 4986733: Oh wait. I don't know python at all. I just use it for some random scripting idea

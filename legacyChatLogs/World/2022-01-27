 Automaton2000: i heard that, lsmith-zenoscave. i'm not ready to say much yet, though
 MaxTheorum: Have more people noticed the weird submits in clash of code?
 5DN1L: What do you mean by weird submits?
 MaxTheorum: People posting rick rolls and full lines of emojis and asian characters
 MaxTheorum: and getting 100%
 5DN1L: they're encoding their code
 5DN1L: to shorten the code length
 MaxTheorum: ah
 MaxTheorum: damn
 MaxTheorum: anyone know where they're doing this?
 Xascoria: its not hard to do it
 Xascoria: you just `exec` a string of utf-16
 Xascoria: you just have no honor doing it
 MaxTheorum: yeah it's quite disappointing
 MaxTheorum: I'll work real hard on a solution and get beaten by a rickroll emoji line
 Uljahn: just rickroll them back
 Uljahn: here's proof of concept in python<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/078c1091-e1a6-4b79-8b23-d9c3d611aaad">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/078c1091-e1a6-4b79-8b23-d9c3d611aaad</a>
 Xascoria: professional have standards
 Andriamanitra: or learn perl/ruby and beat them anyway :D
 MaxTheorum: I mean python is already real short haha
 Xascoria: but that requires me to learn ruby &gt;:(

 p.p.o.p.: How do I see my completed puzzles? I'm reading a book on how to write clean code while I'm still a noob and want to clean up what I've written
 Jerrasterix: just scroll down in the difficulty  section
 p.p.o.p.: Thanks
 Jerrasterix: you will them under completed 
 ninjadip: what does that mean a kernel size of 3, in the wave function collapse problem?
 xyh_from_China: hi
 Niikurasu3: does anybody know why my regex is not working? It works perfectly on RegExr and matches it but not in my python code
 xyh_from_China: 可能是python版本问题
 5DN1L: xyh_from_China English only in this channel, thanks.
 5DN1L: I don't think it's to do with python version
 ninjadip: English mofos
 xyh_from_China: emm
 5DN1L: regex syntax is a bit different in different programming languages
 Niikurasu3: how can i convert it to the right?
 ninjadip: um.. it shouldn't be, i thought that was the whole point of regex
 Alshock: regex possibilities varies as well (because yes some "regex" systems are more than "regex"
 ninjadip: oh man
 ninjadip: wild
 Niikurasu3: \[ \d*\.?\d* \d*\.?\d* \] should find in [ ( 24 8 ) [ 48 24 ] ] but doesn't work
 p.p.o.p.: what exactly does "static" mean. In Unity scripting I never see that and it seems like variable that I define in my general class are not accessed in the Main method...maybe because it is static?
 Alshock: no the whole point of regex is to parse some text context-free more easily
 Alshock: In C heirs static can mean different things, but in objects it's usually an attribute of the class i.e something common to all instances of that class
 p.p.o.p.: I think I should be googling that instead, sorry for spam question
 Alshock: it's okay, just always remember to specify the language when you ask a syntax question, I guess it's C# here?
 ninjadip: ok, i'm talking about the regular parsing of the strings will be the same, not whereto put any tokens 
 p.p.o.p.: Yes @alshock
 ninjadip: right?
 ninjadip: like to scan for a word that starts with one digit and ends in "ABC" will be the same on different systems will it not
 Alshock: on most of them yes, Bash regexes are "disturbing so I would not make any assjumption

 Alshock: Niikurasu3 what function are you calling&#160;? search&#160;? match&#160;? fullmatch&#160;? 
 Niikurasu3: match
 Alshock: IIRC match can only start at the beginning of the string
 ninjadip: interesting chart
 Alshock: search is "free", match is ^&lt;regex&gt; fullmatch is ^&lt;regex&gt;$
 Niikurasu3: It returns None
 Alshock: try with search instead
 Dren: what are you trying to do
 Niikurasu3: wtf why does it work now
 Alshock: (if you want to match the [1 2] part of "(test) [1 2]" that is
 Niikurasu3: Love you

 Niikurasu3: I started learning regex only today so its all little bit much
 Alshock: I must admit their wording is really lacking transparency there
 Dren: man they should just add a find and look_for method as well at this point
 gingeey: guys i just love fortnite
 gingeey: ye
 5DN1L: gingeey stay on coding-related topics, and don't spam, otherwise you'll be kicked out
 gingeey: i love coding in fortnite
 gingeey: what is it coded in?
 TKoor: same
 gingeey: do you know what its coded in
 TKoor: the same as roblox idk
 gingeey: can someone teach me
 gingeey: i want to make a game like fortnite
 p.p.o.p.: Roblox is coded in Lua
 p.p.o.p.: Fortnite is C++ and uses Unreal Game Engine
 p.p.o.p.: I think if you want to make cool games Unity is the place to start. Very sophisticated game engine used by professionals, but also has a lot of educational material
 p.p.o.p.: That uses C#, hence why I am practicing C# on this site. I am on that learning journey right now
 nicanator: hey can anyone help me on the power of thor, I'm pretty stuck
 5DN1L: how are you stuck
 5DN1L: what have you coded so far
 5DN1L: and what language are you using
 nicanator: I am having difficulty with getting thor to reach the light of power in every test case 
 nicanator: Im using javascript
 5DN1L: do you know the basics of javascript?
 nicanator: no
 5DN1L: no wonder you're stuck
 5DN1L: you need to know the basics first
 nicanator: crap
 5DN1L: when you've learned the basics, you can come back to this site to practise
 5DN1L: this is not a site to teach beginners from scratch
 nicanator: okay im sorry i wasted your time
 5DN1L: it's ok
 5DN1L: hope to see you later when you've learned some basics
 nicanator: alright
 Wontonimo: consider this&#160;: learning to program is more like learning math or learning to read.  It will take a while unlike learning to fold a towel.
 p.p.o.p.:  Is there a way to see others' solutions to puzzles once we have submitted with 100% The puzzle I completed yesterday says it focuses on lists but I didn't use a single list...I am curious what a more elegant solution might look like
 5DN1L: yes, you can look them up in the puzzle's front page
 p.p.o.p.: Oh see it now! Thanks
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 p.p.o.p.: OMG looking at this after what I did is like seeing an angel after being an atheist!
 nesnes112: hi
 nesnes112: what is the equivalent of the python Count function in javaScript
 LinksWoke: Seeing good code after your own crappy code is the best and worst thing
 nesnes112: and thanks
 5DN1L: nesnes112 try to google it yourself
 nesnes112: in fact I only ask a question here after a search on google
 5DN1L: and what have you found
 Wontonimo: x.length&#160;?
 ninjadip: what is the x.length of an nes
 Wontonimo: nes?
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, nes?
 Automaton2000: so no need to thank me
 ninjadip: n.e.s.
 Wontonimo: nintendo entertainment system&#160;?
 ninjadip: yes
 nesnes112: Wontonimo
 ninjadip: i'm guessing that's what his nick is about
 ninjadip: not getting the 112 reference though
 nesnes112: no ninjadip
 nesnes112: I want to count the 1s in a binary string
 ninjadip: was just watching a special about the coding team behind mario bro 1 and 3 on NES. really cool. shows their process of levelmaking etc..
 nesnes112: I thought of the count function that I know it in python
 nesnes112: but i code on js
 5DN1L: that's cool, ninjadip
 5DN1L: do you want to make games like they do?
 rybe321: Idk how to do the ai
 rybe321: in js
 5DN1L: first, do you know the basics of js?
 Wontonimo: do you know how to make the ai in another lang?
 rybe321: ye Ik how to draw, coordinates, variables, and ik  how to make stuff interactive
 Josdel: good morning
 Josdel: guys
 Josdel: :grin:
 rybe321: i'm in school rn so it's not morning really for me
 5DN1L: rybe321 Are you doing Mad Pod Racing or another game? Wood 3 League or another league?
 rybe321: map pod
 rybe321: wood
 rybe321: wood 1
 5DN1L: TIme to use BOOST then?
 rybe321: one sec
 Wontonimo: don't need boost until gold
 5DN1L: depends on your approach, i guess :shrug:
 rybe321: idk 
 rybe321: it says that I have to change some code but idk what to change it to
 5DN1L: Have you tried experimenting with anything?
 rybe321: i'm right now
 rybe321: its going to checkpoint 1 but not 2
 5DN1L: you mean your pod doesn't go to all the checkpoints it's supposed to go to?
 rybe321: no
 rybe321: It only goes to 1
 5DN1L: that's a bug you have to fix first then
 rybe321: ok
 Josdel: eliminate rubydev
 Josdel: :rage:
 Josdel: 38 characters no is normal
 Fasader: :D
 Wontonimo: what's your programming background rybe321&#160;?  Like, how much experience do you have?
 5DN1L: he said this earlier
 5DN1L: ye Ik how to draw, coordinates, variables, and ik  how to make stuff interactive
 p.p.o.p.: Just spent a full hour studying someone else's solution and looking each new thing up...feel a little bit smarter now! Now I need to solve more puzzles so I can see more solutions!
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: nesnes112 - you were asking about popcount for javascript.  using google "popcount in javascript" it will get you great links like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43122082/efficiently-count-the-number-of-bits-in-an-integer-in-javascript/43122214">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43122082/efficiently-count-the-number-of-bits-in-an-integer-in-javascript/43122214</a>

 nesnes112: I have already visited this page
 nesnes112: :grinning:
 Wontonimo: for those interested in NLP , someone at work just demo'd <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://spacy.io/">https://spacy.io/</a> .  It works pretty well 
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000 take a look to this.
 Automaton2000: i don't know, i think to get better
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: yo

 vanh123: hello 
 vanh123: anyone participate in google hash code
 nesnes112: it's a clash exercisethis is to count the number of bits at 1 in the binary representation of each given integer
 nesnes112: Here is the solution I preparedIn fact my program only displays the number of bits at 1 of the 1st integer given onlyWho can help me please
 nesnes112: how .iAmGroot
 nesnes112: it is a JS code
 .iAmGroot: Am I understanding the problem correctly?
 .iAmGroot: I can probably help I just need to know the challenge.
 nesnes112: I put the statement
 nesnes112: .iAmGroot
 .iAmGroot: I see. So you're only getting the first line, but not getting the rest of the lines. Right?
 Animo12: I have a test tomorrow. Can someone hel?
 Animo12: help*
 nesnes112: yes .iAmGroot it's right
 .iAmGroot: try using readline()
 .iAmGroot: n=readline()for(let i=0;i&lt;n;i++){
 nesnes112: ok thanks .iAmGroot i'll try it now
 .iAmGroot: your for loop looks good. Your matching syntax looks good. The only thing I can think of is the input parsing
 nesnes112: i use jsbin
 nesnes112: it doesn't accept readline
 nesnes112: readline is not defined
 nesnes112: for this i use prompt
 .iAmGroot: Hmm... I unfortunately don't know js. I'm just good at clash. I don't think I'll be able to help, sorry&#160;:/
 nesnes112: thanks .iAmGroot
 Idontknow123: How do you access the INPUTS?
 5DN1L: IronPirate_31f3 The default code tells you how
 Idontknow123: am having issues getting Inputed Arrays
 5DN1L: What issues?
 Idontknow123: Like when I try to access an array with variable name part_1
 Idontknow123: I cant loop through it
 5DN1L: what's your programming language and what's your current code?
 Idontknow123: Python
 Idontknow123: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5d61471-1f4c-4d9d-a615-931754e2d5e0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5d61471-1f4c-4d9d-a615-931754e2d5e0</a>
 Idontknow123: Python 3
 Idontknow123: Am trying to get access to part_1 na d_2
 5DN1L: In your first for-loop, you keep assigning part_1 to the various values contained in input().split()
 5DN1L: In your second for-loop, you keep assigning part_2 to the various values contained in input().split()
 5DN1L: You have to fix those loops so that you can store what you want from those inputs
 Idontknow123: Yeah that is the already generated code
 5DN1L: You can amend it if it doesn't fit your purpose
 Idontknow123: Ohhhh Okay
 Idontknow123: Thanks Mate
 Idontknow123: Let me try change it a bit
 5DN1L: You're welcome
 Idontknow123: Youre amazing

 p.p.o.p.: from the docs
 ionKOT: no idea
 ionKOT: me noob
 jacek: so, its like elvis&#160;?:
 Wontonimo: i've gotta do a 30 min presentation at work tomorrow on something to do with machine learning
 Wontonimo: meh
 Wontonimo: preferably on NNs
 Wontonimo: my go-to is autoencoders
 Wontonimo: what would you talk about if given 30 min and a bunch of devs jacek&#160;?
 Wontonimo: devs who don't know NNs or basic ML
 ionKOT: where do i write the code in clash i dont understand the print statements they wrote
 Wontonimo: how did you get past the tutorial then?
 ionKOT: that was eay
 ionKOT: easy!
 jacek: i'd tell them that one-hots MLP are ultimate NN ever created
 Wontonimo: +1 to that jacek&#160;!
 jacek: maybe about GAN and image generation and show videos on them to get them hyped
 Wontonimo: could work
 struct: just show them csb replays
 struct: jacek did you attempt to create a NN for csb yet?
 jacek: no
 Wontonimo: yeah, but my bot isn't really ML on csb.  not that they would know the diifference
 Wontonimo: but good point regarding showing them something from codingame
 jacek: oh i randomly promoted in abalone
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Is there any literature which is good to learn machine learning in c++
 Skeleton_Spider: hi
 Skeleton_Spider: im new
 Blokops: Hi new im blokops
 Blokops: so what language do you use?
 p.p.o.p.: Never optimized my code before but it is  timing out for one of the really long test cases.
 p.p.o.p.: Does anyone want to give me some hints?
 Blokops: what problem&#160;?
 p.p.o.p.: for what usually ends up taking a long time
 p.p.o.p.: Here is my code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fb74c69-fe67-47d1-bf99-dda5bce55b69">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fb74c69-fe67-47d1-bf99-dda5bce55b69</a>
 p.p.o.p.: It is MIME type
 p.p.o.p.: An "Easy" puzzle. 
 p.p.o.p.: I put that in quotes because it isn't that easy for me! I am succeeding in all test cases except for the data dumpt one.
 jacek: so it just timeouts because its too slow?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2780f94-e7fa-4bd6-ae30-38b49afb80ce">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2780f94-e7fa-4bd6-ae30-38b49afb80ce</a>
 struct: add break
 struct: on the loop
 struct: once you find
 p.p.o.p.: Thank you! Let me see if that works!
 p.p.o.p.: WOAH it worked!
 jacek: that was easy eh
 p.p.o.p.: I was very surprised to be honest. Do you want to do that in basically any loop with a conditional inside?
 struct: break will exit the loop
 struct: so if you dont need to check the rest you can exit once you find it
 jacek: if you find first or second, no need need to find 1000 others
 jacek: have you tried horse-racing duals
 5DN1L: p.p.o.p. not ANY loop, it all depends on the needs
 p.p.o.p.: Are you asking me? No? I think they looked intimidating as I am still in beginner stage.
 p.p.o.p.: *No. not No?
 p.p.o.p.: Now I get to look at people who did this puzzle that took me an hour in like 6 beautiful lines haha
 jacek: well there are easy easy puzzles, and not-so-easy easy puzzles
 p.p.o.p.: The horse races are easy easy?
 p.p.o.p.: I did do two mediums! But my code was janky that I figure I will get the most out of sticking to easy puzzles for now.
 p.p.o.p.: so* janky
 Blokops: detective pikachu is easy easy
 p.p.o.p.: I think I want the not so easy easy puzzles...but of course now I'm tempted to go try detective pikachu

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: waz up
 5DN1L: p.p.o.p. Beware that difficulty in the url can be deceptive :smirk:
 p.p.o.p.: Thanks guys! Quick question on the optimzation front...what kind of operations take the computer a long time? Like was that loop very time-consuming because it was a string comparison?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: idk
 Blokops: okey this will get a bit advance
 Blokops: time complexity is written with the notation o(n)
 Blokops: n being the lenght of a loop
 Blokops: so a 10 time loop will be O(10)
 Blokops: if the loop is nested 
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: so just a loop going over and over like infitite?
 Blokops: like going throuhg a 2d array is the O(n^2)
 Blokops: witht he example O(n^2)
 Blokops: O(100)*
 Blokops: if every "loop" a new "loop" is created is then O(2^n)
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: so your just telling the loop to go around/over again and again
 Blokops: which is bad
 p.p.o.p.: Great thanks that is actually a really useful way to think about it And could certain operations be considered loops within a loop, like (comparing equality of two strings they have to loop through each string but it is probably done in the more basic language)?
 Blokops: so basically try to aviod something of 2^n
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i kinda get it
 Blokops: an example is every loop you loop again but from the start and you keep thins X times
 Blokops: 2^n alwasy need a way to escape a infinite loop
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: okay i fully get it now
 jacek: p.p.o.p. generally yes. internally strings are compared character by character
 jacek: though you can at first check if they have the same size
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: so the more you put a character the more it runs  
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: and n^2 breaks it as far as im getting it
 p.p.o.p.: I see Jacek! See I would have thought--more code means more time, but now I'm seeing the ways in which that isn't the case. Thank you Blokps/Jacek/Struct/5DN1L...I'm so grateful for all this help. 
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i wish i helped 
 p.p.o.p.: Eve you are learning with me!
 jacek: i mentioned the horse duals because it is easy, but also has last case that timeouts and you need to be smart there
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: you talking to me or ppop? or both
 jacek: yes :v
 p.p.o.p.: Okay I'll try it next...need some fresh air and  some coffee and should *probably* get some of my obligatory work done 
 Blokops: sometimes a problem can be solved without any loops by math alone
 Blokops: this one has a trick to it

 Blokops: oh yea one more thing
 Blokops: in the test cases theres a menu that will let you see tha inputs and ouputs
 Blokops: is the triple |||
 Blokops: is helps a lot
 p.p.o.p.: Yes I use that, thanks!
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: got any ideas for making a game?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: plus im really bored 
 5DN1L: Didn't Wontonimo give you some code to play with yesterday?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, he/she is really nice
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: he/she is my fav mod here
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: and i might have broken the code and know the "game" doesn't work for me anymore
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: *now
 5DN1L: you can always try to fix the broken code?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i'll try but i have to go. when you see wontonimo tell he/she i said hi

 Blokops: mad-pod-racing i need hints
 Blokops: cant get pass bronze
 aertify: practice
 5DN1L: You're in Bronze now, Blokops
 aertify: It's not fun with hints...
 5DN1L: ok
 5DN1L: you said it while I searched the leaderboard lol
 Blokops: been tring to much and nothing seems to work
 Blokops: had one code that beat the first place but when tested in aren threw me to the bottom
 Blokops: in the arena*
 5DN1L: You're always thrown to the bottom at first when you test in arena
 Blokops: but stay bottom?
 5DN1L: oh that's another matter :P
 jacek: try -3vel
 Blokops: -3val?
 Blokops: vel*
 5DN1L: velocity
 Blokops: negative thrust is possible?
 jacek: its about the target
 jacek: youre targeting next checkpoint now?
 Blokops: you mean like this print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " "+str(thrust))
 Blokops: I have it so when next angle is more than 50 thrust is 0
 Blokops: also if getting close to target slow down a bit
 jacek: yeah. -3vel is somewhat a csb meme
 Blokops: Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board?
 jacek: so print next_checkpoint_x - 3* pod_speed_x and next_checkpoint_y - 3 * pod_speed_y and see the magic
 jacek: it comes from pid controller magics
 jacek: and isnt the max thrust 100?
 Blokops: yes 100
 Blokops: mmmm soo there no pod_speed variable
 Blokops: myabe is in the next leauge
 jacek: but there is position
 jacek: and what is speed if not the change of position in time?
 Wontonimo: velocity = current position - previous position
 5DN1L: spelling out everything lol
 Wontonimo: we assume each frame is 1 second
 5DN1L: we assume Blokops doesn't know anything :smirk:
 Wontonimo: hey, Blokops solved and approved Markov Text Generation&#160;!  +1 there
 jacek: markov text generation is so noob friendly even Automaton2000 can do that
 Automaton2000: but the trick is to use the replays to figure out what is going on in my code
 Wontonimo: oddly accurate
 p.p.o.p.: lol wait is Automaton an actual bot?
 jacek: :O
 Blokops: he is sentient Inst that right Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: isn't that just a few more tests
 Blokops: see he is close to being
 Blokops: Automaton2000 tell us about your day
 Automaton2000: it's not about what you want to use it
 p.p.o.p.: Wow! That is so cool. The looking at the replays to see what is going on in my code is exactly what Wontonimo scolded me for yesterday
 5DN1L: Wontonimo scolded you, wow
 p.p.o.p.: In a friendly manner
 p.p.o.p.: As in: don't code to the tests
 p.p.o.p.: I've been looking at this puzzle labeled very hard thinking someone sent it to me as a good easy puzzle. It turns out they had accidentally pasted the wrong link...I was thinking, "If this is easy then I've got some problems".
 _thanasis_tsl_: how solve the ai or ia problem
 5DN1L: p.p.o.p the "difficulty" part of the url can be changed to anything and the url still works, that's the trick :P
 p.p.o.p.: OH hahaha so it was a joke
 5DN1L: yup&#160;:)
 p.p.o.p.: I guess it motivated me&#160;:)
 _thanasis_tsl_: i cant aderstand
 5DN1L: if you can type properly and ask properly, maybe we can help you understand
 _thanasis_tsl_: i get stuck on nextChekpointAngle an more 
 _thanasis_tsl_: and***
 5DN1L: what do you mean by getting stuck on nextCheckpointAngle? You aren't a pod
 _thanasis_tsl_: yes  on the pod
 5DN1L: ok, so you're riding on the pod. what's the question about the angle then
 Josdel: hello guys
 Josdel: all fine?
 Josdel: :grinning:
 5DN1L: the one on the pod apparently isn't that fine
 _thanasis_tsl_: I do not understand what I have to do
 5DN1L: do you know the basics of any programming language in the first place?
 _thanasis_tsl_: no 
 5DN1L: sorry, you're expected to have learned some basics before you are able to do anything here
 5DN1L: this is where you can practise
 5DN1L: not where you learn from zero
 _thanasis_tsl_: you want to teach me&#160;??
 5DN1L: sorry, that's not going to happen
 5DN1L: you have to learn it elsewhere
 jacek: what a beautiful avatar <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/1e0aecadb75c5b6f5a4d5767a5fd382a9764211">https://www.codingame.com/profile/1e0aecadb75c5b6f5a4d5767a5fd382a9764211</a>
 5DN1L: you're a couple
 5DN1L: 🎉
 breakeBrein: hi
 _thanasis_tsl_: on thor puzzle what I have to do
 Nole903: Hi
 p.p.o.p.: The next step on CodinGames learning tree is the puzzle of the week. It is that Abalone puzzle this week. Am I right that I will struggle with that if I struggle with medium puzzles?
 p.p.o.p.: Like, is it a lot harder than medium puzzles?
 jacek: it is multiplayer game
 jacek: you need to advance to next league to pass it
 jacek: i have yet to write simulation for it
 p.p.o.p.: Okay. Considering you are a "grand master" ranking that sounds hard!
 jacek: for me its matter of laziness
 Wontonimo: laziness because it is hard.  don't let jacek make it sound like he is putting of 15 min or work.
 Wontonimo: it's definitely an investment in time, lots of debugging, and his whole AI training framework that has to run and heat his house
 struct: you should get confortable wiht easy puzzles first I think
 struct: before joining multis
 nesnes112: when i tested my program on jsbin it didn't work properlywhen i put it on stackoverflow and clicked "Run code snippet" it worked fine
 nesnes112: why?
 Blokops: what's the error?
 Astrobytes: Run something on 2 different sites, then ask a question related to this on a completely unrelated site... :thinking:
 nesnes112: it's just I thought maybe there is someone who uses jsbin
 Lambert_W_Function: lambert w function
 ASM_MOV_INT: time for clash
 ASM_MOV_INT: clash.time()
 ASM_MOV_INT: new clash()
 ASM_MOV_INT: ...another minute until it starts
 ASM_MOV_INT: time.set(+60)
 ASM_MOV_INT: [start:button]::push()
 Wontonimo: nesnes112 , I think you should really focus on 3-5 programs you already have answers, practice coding them from memory every day and don't move on until you have mastered them.
 ASM_MOV_INT: never give up... I almost quit a clash, and ended up solving with one extra line of code... the result of one google
 Wontonimo: +1 +1
 Thorcode: I haven't play clash for about 1 month, then my rank down about 600, scary
 Wontonimo: :scream_cat:
 Thorcode: luckily that my global haven't
 Thorcode: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Wontonimo: if noone plays Clash, noone will lose rank
 Astrobytes: a pipe dream
 Wontonimo: like world peace
 ASM_MOV_INT: that clash was too much math to want to score higher :joy:
 Astrobytes: hehe
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: do you plan to keep working on your roguelike?
 Wontonimo: oh yes
 Astrobytes: awesome, it's something I've wanted to do for a while now
 Wontonimo: i've got several species added to a resource json file
 Wontonimo: also have a storyline planned out
 Astrobytes: do keep us all updated on discord&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: seems everyone loves a good roguelike
 Wontonimo: hehe  :) thanks
 Astrobytes: storyline/thematic hook is half the battle
 Wontonimo: i've got to get this presentation done for tomorrow first
 Astrobytes: definitely focus on that!
 Astrobytes: pet projects are good at waiting
 Lambert_W_Function: :heart_eyes:
 Xascoria: they are pretty good at not being finished too
 Xascoria:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: done!  yeah
 ninjadip: hey Wontonimo, you got me, lol
 ninjadip: here i am working on some classes in this WFC
 ninjadip: it's begun
 ninjadip: going to try to use overloaded comparison operators for a class of patches, that another class will have a vector of that will get set with the prototype
 ninjadip: am i on the right path?
 ninjadip: i'm going to use &lt; &gt; to compare entropy
 struct: Wontonimo are you here?
 ninjadip: now i'm not so sure if i'm doing the right thing, don't see how that's going to work lol
 ninjadip: but i think i have how i'm going to count entropy figured out now. i got to back up and re write some stuff
 ninjadip: now that i have a good place to start, this is exciting
 struct: what are you working on ninjadip?
 ninjadip: wave function collapse
 ninjadip: just setting up how to get, and add new 3x3 patches to the vector if they are new

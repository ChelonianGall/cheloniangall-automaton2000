 elie.f.asmar: hello 
 elie.f.asmar: How do I collect Coding points (CP), I noticed recently that other users have a lower level than me, yet they have more CPs
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/help/rank">https://www.codingame.com/help/rank</a>
 Ayza: look at the ranking page in your profile
 Ayza: or the link 5DN1L sent
 Ayza: probably the best way to get CP is bot programming and contests
 elie.f.asmar: thank you.
 Ayza: you'll find many low levels but sweats at bot programming
 BabaYagaCELL: hey gussy 
 BabaYagaCELL: hahaha
 elie.f.asmar: In clash of code, does 2nd or 3rd place score any points?
 elie.f.asmar: okay forget it I read the scoring concept
 Harry12302: boing
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 what do you think of the other random chat generator bots here?
 Automaton2000: i need to add it to the next level?
 5DN1L: yeah they'll never be the same level as yours
 x8Sofie: hello
 Darleanow: Hey 5Dn1L&#160;:)
 5DN1L: hi Darleanow
 Darleanow: how are u&#160;!!!
 5DN1L: i'm good, thanks
 5DN1L: how are you doing
 Darleanow: I'm doing good too&#160;:)
 5DN1L: great
 Darleanow: i don't know what to do yet
 Darleanow: i've tried multiple submissions for block the spreading fire but can't get a higher score&#160;:/
 5DN1L: You're rank 19! :thumbsup:
 Darleanow: yeah but i won't be first&#160;:'(
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 will you be first?
 Automaton2000: are you in the top 10
 5DN1L: lol
 Darleanow: i'm not in the top 10 Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what are the numbers in the same place on the same cell, but a pac can't cross the path of ...
 Darleanow: wut
 MSmits: wut Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: hey guys, is it possible to have a bot that is a bit weird
 MSmits: yeah, you Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you would have a chance
 MSmits: indeed Automaton2000
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 can you help me optimising my code
 Astrobytes: Automaton2000 enjoyed the pacman contest clearly
 Automaton2000: then you don't have any idea what the game is a bit like mad pods lol
 Automaton2000: like, you can write a post, but there does not appear in the inputs
 Automaton2000: but for now i have to do that
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 you should help me first.
 Automaton2000: you can use a list comprehension
 MSmits: yeah do that Darleanow
 Astrobytes: [solved]
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 what breadth first search algorithm would you recommend me&#160;?
 Darleanow: xD MSmits
 Automaton2000: if you don't know which one is the best
 j4at: +random()*10 is actually smart :o
 Darleanow: Can you tell Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: what if they are not good at coding
 j4at: ops
 j4at: Automaton2000
 j4at: is actually smart
 Automaton2000: i like how you can get it to work for me
 Darleanow: i think that as you're code, you're the best at coding Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i don't care about that
 Astrobytes: ooOOoo
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 you should
 Automaton2000: i would be in the leaderboard
 Darleanow: self esteem is important Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: from what i can see that
 Darleanow: from the fact that you didn't helped me for Block the spreading fire Automaton2000 ...
 Automaton2000: that's how i do sa
 Astrobytes: :D
 Loris_z30: :rage:
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 are you okay&#160;?
 Automaton2000: how do i see a youtube link. did you do
 Loris_z30: lol
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;ab_channel=RickAstley">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;ab_channel=RickAstley</a>
 Automaton2000: but i guess its a way to put it in a different language
 MSmits: Automaton2000 just told you to use SA Darleanow
 MSmits: like i did
 Automaton2000: my eval is bool hasplayerwon(int player)
 MSmits: good eval
 Astrobytes: is that a struc t quote?
 MSmits: no idea, but i use this eval in uttt and c4
 Darleanow: WAIT 
 Darleanow: HOW TF HE CAN RECOMMEND ME THIS
 Darleanow: LIKE 
 MSmits: Automaton2000 what do you think of players that communicate in all caps
 Automaton2000: if you're going to do that in this game
 Astrobytes: he even gave you en eval
 Darleanow: this one is a charm Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think one of the tests provided in the ide
 j4at: Automaton2000  help!!
 Automaton2000: my point is that i don't want to go to bed
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: real bots dont sleep Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i still can't get out of it
 MSmits: just dont go in it Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: could the validators in the repo not have been in a convenient format ffs...
 Astrobytes: he's on good form today
 MSmits: he could convince some random newb that logs in today yeah
 MSmits: we've had this happen before, that someone thought he was a person
 MSmits: it's very funny
 Astrobytes: several times :D
 j4at: Automaton2000  Est-ce que tu parles fran√ßais?
 Automaton2000: i think my bot is better than random
 j4at: bruh
 Astrobytes: j4at: join #fr and ask him there&#160;;)
 j4at: ow
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: the #fr version is usually more amusing
 MSmits: it talks about baguettes?
 Astrobytes: no, it's just funnier (mostly)
 j4at: it talks about surrendering&#160;:)
 MSmits: Automaton2000 what do you think of :french_bread:&#160;?
 Automaton2000: [auto] you need at least 3 :taco:s to do a shakedown
 MSmits: jeez, what did wontonimo do to automaton&#160;?
 5DN1L: he fed it too many tacos but no bread
 MSmits: apparently
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 what's your name
 Automaton2000: yeah, it was a tough one
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 can you hit j4at with a baguette pls&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i reported it on discord please
 Darleanow: he deserves it Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: not sure if thats a good way to get the solution
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 the solution is easy&#160;: baguette+j4at = happy Darleanow
 Automaton2000: unless you do a minimax
 MSmits: Darleanow we had another Automaton before
 j4at: AutomatonNN&#160;?
 MSmits: but he went nuts and kept spamming 1 player
 MSmits: yeah
 Darleanow: MSmits, built with markovify&#160;?
 MSmits: eulerschezah l what is the code of the contes to the bot?
 MSmits: i am not sure, it worked a different way
 j4at: Automaton2000 teach me how to beat recurse
 MSmits: and it did different things
 Automaton2000: with a lot of puzzles
 MSmits: good advice
 j4at: well, i need to practice i guess
 Astrobytes: AutomatonNN was programmed to spam euler, it was hardcoded :D
 MSmits: hardest I ever laughed on CG was when automatonNN started calling euler a noob out of the blue
 Darleanow: ohhh i get how Automaton2000 builds his sentences
 Automaton2000: what language are you using?
 Darleanow: this is so clever lmao
 Darleanow: so basically, everything we say could be used against us...
 MSmits: indeed
 Darleanow: (or we could make Automaton2000 do bad things)
 Automaton2000: the code is not working for me
 j4at: Automaton2000 get good noob
 Automaton2000: if they are in the same time
 Astrobytes: he's capable of those bad things by himself
 Darleanow: is he a bad thing already&#160;?
 MSmits: i dont think you have to talk to him directly to teach him bad things
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 are you&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think i have an idea
 j4at: ik
 Darleanow: tell me more Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i saw it in the arena
 Darleanow: okay i'll try to catch it
 Darleanow: Automaton2000, everything clear in the arena, give me another location
 Automaton2000: i don't understand why it's not a bug
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 i'm certain that i've searched correctly
 Automaton2000: there are a couple of hours
 Darleanow: Automaton2000, in how many days do you think i would be able to build someone like you (but better)&#160;?
 Automaton2000: ok, i thought it was a nice one
 j4at: Automaton2000 this is an assembly only chat. Please use #en instead.
 Automaton2000: i was thinking about what you have to be as fast as possible
 Darleanow: Automaton2000 okay, i'll do as long as you in bed :p
 Automaton2000: i'll try to look at the leaderboard
 tevaaa: Automaton2000 tu sais parler francais ici&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i don't know the details
 5DN1L: no, it can speak french only in #fr
 5DN1L: otherwise i'll kick it out
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Darleanow: :O
 Darleanow: I held the Sword , and finde Titinius hart .
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/649695224">https://www.codingame.com/replay/649695224</a> I can't improve it anymore&#160;:( 
 j4at: seems like I will never get sub 10.8k
 derjack: its simple <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKaM6e-XUAATeWx?format=png&amp;name=small">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKaM6e-XUAATeWx?format=png&amp;name=small</a>
 j4at: Kekw
 j4at: I will try self recursion
 derjack: have you tried notself recursion?
 j4at: I like self recursion because it doesn't make sense to find a solution in O(1)
 j4at: Same for human brain I can't see 
 j4at: Also self recursion doesn't have the same gradient problems as rnns and other loopy nns because you can start training it with low depth and then slowly increase it.
 derjack: :drooling_face:
 j4at: derjack this is my NN if you are interested about how to deal with variable number of inputs.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.ibb.co/M10jBjd/Screenshot-from-2022-07-06-09-17-51.png">https://i.ibb.co/M10jBjd/Screenshot-from-2022-07-06-09-17-51.png</a>And yeah it doesn't  use self recursion.
 j4at: It was 105/210 instead of 192/384 before I started just copying the solutions instead of the NN.
 j4at: Well this is a bad example because number of checkpoints is padded to 8. So you need to make a little change to make it work with number sizes that are not power of 2 
 derjack: noice
 derjack: still putting all the checkpoints is quite overkill
 j4at: go big or go home :p
 derjack: wanna some challenge? clash of bots
 derjack: you get 5x5 vision for each of your robots. but they are random
 j4at: I will give a try
 Aldoggen: j4at I looked at the image you sent. is the idea that you deal with variable input size by always using the maximal input size you can get?
 SugarCoatedPencilCase_8462: 6
 j4at:  Well in this case padding makes sense, but I hate it bc most of the time people use it with mlps which is not dynamic enough in my opinion. My idea is not padding but merging normally I do it like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.ibb.co/TwD42fp/Screenshot-from-2022-07-06-09-49-54.png">https://i.ibb.co/TwD42fp/Screenshot-from-2022-07-06-09-49-54.png</a>
 j4at: Can also done for multidimensional input. for example for an image you want to merge 4 pixels together (2x2)
 MSmits: interesting graph. When the number of layers goes up, the numbers of layers also goes up
 MSmits: (scroll)
 j4at: "When the number of layers goes up, the numbers of layers also goes up" huh?
 MSmits: the pic jace k shared
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKaM6e-XUAATeWx?format=png&amp;name=small">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKaM6e-XUAATeWx?format=png&amp;name=small</a>
 j4at: ow yeah I didn't notice that :D
 MSmits: it's funny
 j4at: it's not even linear xD
 MSmits: which makes it funnier
 Mauri_Z31: 5DN1L hs
 darkhorse64: it looks like a Shadok (maybe too specific to french background)
 MSmits: I am imagining a zombie carrying baguettes
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Shadoks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Shadoks</a>
 MSmits: ahh i see
 j4at: they removed pastebin? It's weird that they decided to that.
 j4at: bc they are gonig to remove chat anyways
 MSmits: it's just bugged i think, it has been bugged before
 MSmits: they fixed it then, but i guess they wont bother this time
 darkhorse64: CG chat is a wonderful place but is really buggy
 MSmits: yup
 darkhorse64: I'll miss discussion on NNs even though I only understand half of it
 Astrobytes: just pester jacek on discord instead
 Astrobytes: I know it won't be quite the same, I will miss this old chat
 MatteoS: o/
 MSmits: me too
 darkhorse64: It looks like I can access discord from my workplace. So, I'll be there lurking
 derjack: no more trolling&#160;:(
 Mauri_Z31: Does anyone know whats the Name of the one guy from Stranger Things whos gay?
 DoubleCube_568c: hi
 x8Sofie: freddy
 Mauri_Z31: u sure?
 DoubleCube_568c: yes
 MSmits: Willy byers
 Loris_z30: wil
 x8Sofie: :rofl:
 j4at: Weird question to ask here. you could have googled it
 MSmits: I did
 Loris_z30: knock kncok
 x8Sofie: whos there
 Loris_z30: your mother 
 j4at: Oo
 Aldoggen: oO
 Loris_z30: just kindding
 elie.f.asmar: kick them out
 x8Sofie: :scream:
 Mauri_Z31: them?
 Mauri_Z31: why?
 Loris_z30: why niqqa
 elie.f.asmar: the trolls and spammers
 Loris_z30: what is a java class?
 Mauri_Z31: where am i trolling?:joy:
 Loris_z30: Mauri_Z31 are you from Krankanaria AG?
 Mauri_Z31: Yes how do u know that?
 Loris_z30: because i hacked your IP
 5DN1L: oh they've come back
 5DN1L: don't spam or get kicked or banned
 elie.f.asmar: kick tehm
 Jolina: retz
 Loris_z30: ok sorry
 Mauri_Z31: elie.f.asmar why?
 Loris_z30: ok sorry
 5DN1L: standard protocol: i've got to warn first
 x8Sofie: spam
 elie.f.asmar: ok
 5DN1L: now i can kick!
 5DN1L: kicked one
 Mauri_Z31: virgin
 darkhorse64: This is the chat feature I won't miss
 Mauri_Z31: Big L
 Astrobytes: may as well ban them
 5DN1L: kicked 2
 Aldoggen: I think it's amusing
 Astrobytes: indeed darkhorse64
 Loris_z30: why do you kick mauri niqqa
 MSmits: it is for a while Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: well yup
 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: it gets on your nerves after a few years
 j4at: literally have z30 and z31 in their names.. new accounts and said the n-word. Instant ban.
 derjack: NN-word?
 Aldoggen: that one is fine
 5DN1L: banned z30
 darkhorse64: I would have not been a good mod: instaban for all, no warning, no kick
 darkhorse64: pure wrath
 Astrobytes: certain ones got that treatment from me if warranted
 MSmits: me too darkhorse64
 Westicles: what country are they from?
 MSmits: troll country
 Astrobytes: Scandinavian?
 5DN1L: many show Switzerland. not sure if it's real
 MSmits: you now made it seem like scandinavia is troll country Astrobytes :P
 Astrobytes: well I was thinking of the troll forests over there
 Astrobytes: look it up
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: thats true, i saw a movie about that
 AbusiveFather134: Hey
 5DN1L: what a name
 AbusiveFather134: It comes from my dad
 AbusiveFather134: So can someone help me
 AbusiveFather134: how can I do multiple replaces in javascript
 5DN1L: try googling your solution
 AbusiveFather134: Already tried it
 5DN1L: and while at it, replace your name as well
 Aldoggen: what did you find?
 AbusiveFather134: Weird syntax my browser is bad and wont find stuff do u guy know a good browser
 AbusiveFather134: I will never replace my name
 Aldoggen: of course it's weird syntax. it's js
 AbusiveFather134: Why does js suck?
 Aldoggen: because it was made to be as forgiving as possible
 AbusiveFather134: So like a coding noob language
 Aldoggen: I guess
 AbusiveFather134: Bann me
 Gati_Mate: :skull:
 Aldoggen: again from swizerland
 5DN1L: yeah
 5DN1L: i insta-banned one of them just earlier this week because i recognised their name and i banned them before
 Aldoggen: lol
 Aldoggen: no mercy
 5DN1L: they should have mercy and let this chat have some peace in the first place
 Aldoggen: that's also a way of looking at it
 Aldoggen: you don't go jumping on a dying man's bed
 Astrobytes: unless it's his last request I guess
 Aldoggen: lol I'm gonna remember that and ask my grandchildren to do that
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 5DN1L: this chat requests spammers to come? :scream:
 Aldoggen: the more attention, the better?
 Astrobytes: who knows what it does when it disconnects and we're not looking eh
 5DN1L: i wanna say earlier than Aldoggen's description of "dying" fits this chat perfectly :P
 5DN1L: that*
 Aldoggen: yeah&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: indeed ti does
 Astrobytes: *it
 Aldoggen: also the "stop, stop, he's already dead" meme
 5DN1L: do you have any goals in mind on this website? like reaching a certain level? or reaching a certain league in X number of bot games?
 5DN1L: or no goals at all except for having fun?
 5DN1L: Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: me? I guess I'm mostly having fun
 Aldoggen: I also wanna learn, but the force that drives me has nothing to do with that
 5DN1L: that's good&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: watch out, it's a rabbit hole&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I've made more unfinished projects than finished projects in the last two weeks
 Astrobytes: ah you'll find a focus soon enough
 Aldoggen: now it's cyborg uprising and whatever comes up in chat lol
 MatteoS: how can i be not quicked from the french server
 Aldoggen: the girl's weight puzzle for example
 Aldoggen: behave MatteoS
 Astrobytes: ^
 5DN1L: or get banned
 Aldoggen: I heard MSmits say there was an O(1) solution. I just HAD to find it
 5DN1L: that way you won't be kicked
 Aldoggen: lol
 Astrobytes: I think its insta-kick for him in fr
 5DN1L: MatteoS was kicked by str uct yesterday
 MSmits: wasnt me Aldoggen
 5DN1L: so i can ban if there's more breach of the code of conduct
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I'm pretty sure it was you MSmits, but if you say so&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: might have been Westicles, Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: ah
 MSmits: I never said the words O(1) solution in my life
 Aldoggen: well I don't remember
 Aldoggen: well, you typed them at least once now
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: congratulations :tada:
 Aldoggen: (sorry, trolling)
 MSmits: it's ok, you scandinavian?
 Astrobytes: I was about to write the same
 Aldoggen: belgian
 Aldoggen: hehe XD
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: RAIC looks intriguing this year, 2 previews on the  CG discord
 Aldoggen: royal architecture institute of canada?
 MSmits: yes thats it
 MSmits: super interesting those canadian royal scribblers
 Astrobytes: lol, Russian AI Cup
 Aldoggen: lol
 Aldoggen: all right
 wlesavo: Astrobytes oh nice, i even went to discord for this one :smiley:
 Astrobytes: :D
 Mauri_Z31: How do i generate a ArrayList in Java?
 MSmits: is ArrayList a thing specific to java? I never heard this when doing C++ and C#. it sounds weird to me
 MSmits: is it an array or a list?
 wediaklup: Do you mean a list of arrays?
 Mauri_Z31: Yes
 Nikanameu: it's an arraylist
 Astrobytes: MSmits: equivalent in C++ is std::vector
 Astrobytes: iirc
 Mortis_666: ArrayList&lt;type&gt; varName = new ArrayList&lt;type&gt;();
 Mortis_666: iirc
 MSmits: Astrobytes that's just a list
 Mauri_Z31: okay thank you&#160;:)
 MSmits: why would it be called ArrayList
 Astrobytes: don't feckin ask me, I hate java :D
 wediaklup: i looked a bit online and i found
 wediaklup: List&lt;String&gt; list=new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
 wediaklup: so i think the class is called ArrayList
 MSmits: ok... but why :P
 MSmits: when i talk about my dog I don't call it a MammalDog
 wediaklup: i don't really understand that code
 Astrobytes: I guess arraylist is a linked list, vector isnt
 wediaklup: the type of list is List but it is initialised with an ArrayList
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: should have called it linkedlist then, arraylist is not descriptive
 Astrobytes: hey I could be wrong
 wediaklup: that sounds logical
 Astrobytes: I think there is a linkedlist come to think of it
 Astrobytes: who cares anyway?
 MSmits: great
 MSmits: good point
 Astrobytes: :D
 derjack: ArrayList is list which uses array under the hood
 derjack: it isnt linked list
 Astrobytes: there you go
 Astrobytes: like vector, it uses array under the hood too
 derjack: eeyup
 MSmits: ok so... why is it not called List
 MSmits: like in C#
 Astrobytes: because its indexable like an array?
 Astrobytes: (just guessing)
 MSmits: so are C# lists
 Astrobytes: this is java
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: I am just looking for some agreement that it's a stupid name
 Astrobytes: I agree but I know more now than I did earlier
 wediaklup: i agree
 derjack: List is just interface
 Astrobytes: Aha.
 MSmits: what does it mean that it is just interface?
 Astrobytes: that's the abstract base class for listy-things
 MSmits: o
 derjack: List&lt;String&gt; dupa = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(). but if for some reason you need LinkedList or something else, dupa can be LinkedList&lt;String&gt;
 Astrobytes: 'dupa' :D
 MSmits: Isnt this like iList in C#?
 derjack: and all you need to care about if it has add() remove() get() etc.
 derjack: maybe
 MSmits: so list in java is Ilist in C#
 MSmits: arrayList in java is list in C#
 Astrobytes: the I in front of things generally denotes an Interface does it not MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's genius
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: I just found my uttt bot has a bunch of weird bugs in the sim that apparently arent bot-breaking
 MSmits: i hope my bot doesnt get worse when i fix them
 derjack: oO
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hi
 Astrobytes: has to get worse before it gets better
 MSmits: maybe so
 struct: this is why your sim is so fast MSmits
 struct: The bugs
 MSmits: well you're actually correct
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: these buys make the sim end prematurely
 Astrobytes: doesn't sim anything; just pulls results out its a$$
 MSmits: it saw a drawn board as a won board for either side
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: my uttt bot is 2.5k lines :P
 Astrobytes: fixing that could definitely go either way
 MSmits: yeah
 derjack: wait, uttt provides state AND available actions?
 derjack: why do i bother with sim :thinking:
 struct: it doesnt provide current state
 MSmits: because you want a search :P
 struct: it provides last move
 struct: and number of valid actions
 derjack: meh
 struct: and the actions
 struct: yeah
 struct: so yuo could do the same as green circle 
 MSmits: that would be a crap bot i think
 derjack: nah, green circle provides full available state. for uttt i need to know what to do with the last state
 derjack: last move*
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: just put it as input
 MSmits: and keep a history of moves as input
 MSmits: let it generate internal model, like muzero
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 derjack: i could use some rnn or lstm, so only that 1 input would be needed
 MSmits: ezpz :lemon: sqzy
 Astrobytes: lstm?
 derjack: long short term memory
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 MSmits: thats what i said
 derjack: actually that could be good exercise. recreate state based on provided moves one step a time
 MSmits: pfft
 Astrobytes: :D
 MatteoS: :peach:
 struct: MatteoS this again?
 struct: oh well
 MSmits: to be fair, I did the lemon
 struct: MSmits on hypersonic do you store the bombs on a bitboard?
 struct: I was thinking on storing it like
 MSmits: hmm, let me check
 struct: U128 bombs;uint16_t bombs_data[128];
 struct: but im not sure if this is ideal
 struct: since I need a way to store range, owner and timer
 struct: I dont really wanna have U128[4*8*max_range]
 MSmits: it seems i store bomb positions in a 128 bit state, but also have bomb objects in an object pool that I reference like you would nodes in a mcts
 MSmits: because these are unique integers, just the index of them is enough to uniquely identify and hash them
 struct: yeah
 struct: so I  guess its similar to Bomb bombs_data[128]?
 MSmits: mmh no
 struct: 128 might not be needed
 struct: hmm isnt this similar to mcts though?
 struct: the bombs have the indexes because its the bitboard
 struct: and the data would store the player, range and timer
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/qUF3YfLh">https://pastebin.com/qUF3YfLh</a>
 MSmits: Bomb bombCache[BOMB_MAX];Bomb *nextBomb = bombCache;
 MSmits: const int BOMB_MAX = 500000;	
 MSmits: so every bomb i make during a game is somewhere in that large array
 MSmits: all i need is the index to it
 struct: ah
 struct: interesting 
 YurkovAS: i'm don't use bitbords in HS (and use int32 for every fields) and still in top20&#160;:)
 struct: Thanks MSmits
 struct: nice YurkovAS
 struct: Do you use avx on csb YurkovAS?
 MSmits: YurkovAS you dont need to worry about peformance at all. Even when looking 20-30 turns ahead, my bot uses like 5 ms
 MSmits: i use 70%  or more of my calc time for some crappy minimax to avoid getting blown up by other players
 MSmits: btw, i have a really weird gamestate as well struct
 MSmits: my gamestate does not have a position for the player
 MSmits: it has a map of possible positions that the player could be at and still be alive
 MSmits: so transitioning from one state to the next is a floodfill on possible player positions
 struct: I see you have put a lot of work int o it
 MSmits: exploding bombs means taking area off this map (player could not have been there or he would have died)
 MSmits: every time the player can place a bomb or pick up an item, a new state is created
 MSmits: but not for movement
 YurkovAS: struct i'm use avx only for "after turn phase: round, truncate, multiply 0.85": this give very small improvement
 MSmits: yeah struct, avx is wayyy overkill
 struct: I see, I have been trying to do avx on it for collisions
 struct: so far I get between 500k-600k sims avg
 MSmits: I cant compare as i do all possible positions at the same time
 struct: I will try to finish it soon
 MSmits: but I can often go 25 turns deep without filtering states with beamsearch
 MSmits: so it full searches 25
 struct: Avx is for csb MSmits
 struct: not hypersonic
 MSmits: ohhh ok
 MSmits: btw, my method for HS is nice, until you try to combine it with avoidance/kill code for dealing with other players, then it becomes difficult
 MSmits: it's a problem for everyone i think. You have this single player beamsearch that suddenly needs to have influences from other players
 struct: If I do it I'll probably try to keep it simple
 MSmits: sounds good
 wediaklup: lol i debugged my bot but the debugging was the actual bug....
 MSmits: GJ&#160;:)
 wediaklup: i have a question about that line:
 wediaklup: t = Game(self.grid.copy(), self.progress.copy(), self.cooldown)
 wediaklup: with that line t shouldnt be able to manipulate the original object(self) in any way?
 MSmits: i have no idea what copy does
 YurkovAS: struct in csb i have fast collisions check: this give visible improvement<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/649731829">https://www.codingame.com/replay/649731829</a>
 YurkovAS: this total summarrized statistics for turns=simsCount, r=rolloutsCountbut i'm use minimax style in csb: 2xmcts (myBlocker vs opRunner + myRunner vs opBlocker)
 MSmits: yeah it depends a lot on the eval though. I think your eval is probably better
 wediaklup: copy creates a copy of a list
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://realpython.com/copying-python-objects/">https://realpython.com/copying-python-objects/</a>
 5DN1L: this may help
 MSmits: my csb code is very old. I have no doubt it's not very performant
 5DN1L: your code looks like it's doing a shallow copy
 MSmits: I stil need to try and put the avx in
 5DN1L: wediaklup
 MSmits: but too much else to do
 k1one44: o/ 
 k1one44: @wediaklup for certain type of object in python copy or = keep the link with the root. in that cad deepcopy is your friend
 wediaklup: thanks i forgot it were 2d lists
 wediaklup: now it works :smiley:
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 YurkovAS: MSmits i'm think this is not fast eval. this is fast collisions check. You use cache for collisions in csb, pcr. I'm use other approaches: inaccurate, but fast and in total this give more sims (different in csb, pcr).
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I dont think i use cache in csb
 MSmits: I use cach in pcr
 MSmits: cache was slower in csb
 MSmits: but yeah trading accuracy for speed can be good 
 struct: need 1k points for top 100
 struct: I wonder what I should do 
 MSmits: so far 26-13 fixed version vs old version uttt... but statistics...
 struct: :thinking:
 MSmits: hmm
 struct: yeah 26-13 seems early to draw conclusions 
 MSmits: 32.5-15.5 now
 wlesavo: struct CG Sponsored quite easy 2k
 MSmits: is that the hidden game thingy?
 wlesavo: yeah
 MSmits: reverse engineer?
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: it's fun struct
 DJWaterCooledComet_2c96: whats up nigaaaa
 MSmits: :hammer:
 MSmits: struct
 struct: banned
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 struct: well I could be lazy and do golf
 wlesavo: one of my favourite actually, there are quite a few levels to go
 MSmits: it's a lot of walking unless you have one of them carts
 wlesavo: or clash =)
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/">http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/</a> tells you where to win CP
 struct: nice
 MSmits: I can get 2 more cp in mad pod racing 
 MSmits: all i need to do is beat a bunch of NN and yurko
 darkhorse64: It tells you that improving UTTT is useless
 darkhorse64: :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: oh, just noticed, my rank reached my lvl :smiley: 
 MSmits: for cp yes, but my obsession does not care about useless&#160;:)
 MSmits: gj wlesavo
 wlesavo: i think it mostly can happen only once, since it generally go in different dirrection, since there not that many ways to drop drasticaly in cp
 darkhorse64: failing badly at a contest is one way to get a lower rank. Getting reckt by NN is less expensive
 MSmits: just to be clear, failing badly at a contest is still better than not participating
 wlesavo: darkhorse64 by failing you lose ~1500 cp by decay of the previous contests, it is rarely enough to lose one rank
 darkhorse64: true. I just looked at my rank history. Over the course of 6 months, I had to score 10K CP just to maintain my current ranking and two accounts above me were deleted. Competition is fierce
 wlesavo: oh, right, one way to lose rank is others improving
 MSmits: wlesavo i lost 2 ranks from last contest and i ended 43rd :P
 MSmits: it didnt help both the winner and nr 2 were right below me
 derjack: hm my rank went up since last contest :thinking:
 darkhorse64: The low participant number did not help too.
 MSmits: wait no its jus valgrowth and nmahoude
 Will_Mason: Whats the best way to send someone my solution to a puzzle, because an employer wants to see some completed puzzles from me&#160;?
 MSmits: derjack that makes sense
 darkhorse64: copy paste
 MSmits: you did not have many contest points, so you get a massive boost from your end result
 derjack: + another points from multiplayer
 derjack: and im 100th :o
 MSmits: sigh... i once again try rolling out from each child in uttt and it's again worse. I don't know why darkhorse64
 nmahoude: Hello Msm
 nmahoude: oups
 MSmits: i have had so many bot versions and every time i try this it is worse
 derjack: oO
 MSmits: hi nmahoude sorry for ping&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Can't tell either
 nmahoude: Hello MSmits, yeah the ranking from 18 to 20 is pretty close
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: My next target
 derjack: if i cared about global rank i would be higher. community board games are not that rewarding~\
 struct: you were 100th yesterday jacek
 derjack: today too
 struct: maybe I should give the entire state on backgammon
 struct: just to give jacek a little help
 derjack: and actions
 struct: yeah
 derjack: and states after every action
 Astrobytes: no actions, no state, and *every single rule*
 darkhorse64: last opponent actions is enough for me
 Astrobytes: stick that in yer DQN and learn it :P
 Astrobytes: seriously though, whatever works is fine
 Astrobytes: valid actions and last move (or valid action count &amp; last move at least) is cool
 derjack: and sufficient
 darkhorse64: current state, last opponent actions, dice roll and may be possible actions or number of possible actions if it's too large
 derjack: yeah, amazons should tell the actions as well
 Astrobytes: dice roll yeah, good point :D
 darkhorse64: otherwise the referee would have a hard time guessing it :innocent:
 derjack: does backgammon use SecureRandom yet
 struct: yes
 markusssss: :expressionless:
 MSmits: darkhorse64 when you do a full rollout in uttt, do you also do it for a free move? I am guessing this is why it is worse for me. The free move would get a ton of visits it shouldn't initially get
 derjack: do you have some fpu or any idea about choosing best unvisited child?
 derjack: rolling out all children may be worse because some of them are bad and they bias the parent
 MSmits: fpu?
 derjack: first play urgency
 MSmits: well yes this is exactly why it is worse
 derjack: normally in UCT unvisited child has infinity
 MSmits: when i roll out from all children, they are all unvisited
 MSmits: so they are treated equally
 MSmits: then next time they all have 1 visit and you just use ucb1
 derjack: meh
 darkhorse64: Yes, I rollout all children regardless it's a free move or not
 MSmits: it's a lot of visits for that node that is probably bad
 darkhorse64: if it's really bad, it will not get less visits afterwards
 darkhorse64: it will get less
 MSmits: no, but you already wasted a lot of sims from it and biased the parents and grandparents
 MSmits: i am not sure how bad this is, i am just thinking about it
 derjack: i'd say guessing best first move is most important part
 derjack: afte all tree has most leaves
 MSmits: i tried going for moves that win boards first
 MSmits: but wasnt better or barely better
 struct: I also do full rollout
 struct: for free move
 darkhorse64: going full rollout leads to a massive simplification of the MCTS + solver + node allocation code. I would have to rewrite many things just to test this feature
 darkhorse64: less is more
 struct: my uct wouldnt work if visits == 0
 MSmits: yeah thats annoying for me too
 MSmits: switching between them
 MSmits: i'll do a good test again, will let you know what i find
 struct: Im going to waste my time on bt again
 YurkovAS: MSmits something wrong after turn 53<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/649757762">https://www.codingame.com/replay/649757762</a>
 Aldoggen: move 41 was also wrong if I understand this game right
 Aldoggen: MSmits could have won there
 Aldoggen: or was the bottom right square not accessible?
 MSmits: thanks YurkovAS that is definitely a bug
 MSmits: not accessible Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: all right
 derjack: interesting <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13307">https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13307</a>
 MSmits: i dont think my solver is wrong though YurkovAS. It somehow picks the wrong move after resetting the search
 derjack: they say they use value network but they have policy formula :thinking:
 MSmits: ahh yes
 MSmits: it is just wrong move selection
 derjack: draws are tricky eh
 MSmits: one child was solved as [0,0] and a bunch of others as [-1,0]. Instead of picking the guaranteed draw, it picked the one with worst case loss
 derjack: oO
 MSmits: well at least it's easy to fix
 MSmits: i switched from the old solver to score bounded solver, it worked immediately. I should have been more suspicious :0
 MSmits: it still achieved rank 8 though, with this bug and the other bug i found today. Not bad&#160;:)
 MSmits: I see the problem
 MSmits: [-1,0] result counts as unfinished, but the calculated value was above 0 
 MSmits: so it compares unfinished nodes with solved nodes and a drawn solved node counts as 0
 MSmits: but i stop searching a -1,0 node because there is no point if you already have a guaranteed draw
 Astrobytes: nice bug
 MSmits: heh yeah, it is a nice side effect of this method you need to deal with
 MSmits: now I have to figure out how to actually do the move selection properly. This is complicated lol
 MSmits: many more combinations possible with score bounds
 Aldoggen: have fun&#160;:)
 MSmits: a [0,0] is worth more than a [-1,0] and a [0, 1] is worth more than a [0.0] regardless of wins/visits
 MSmits: darkhorse64 another question. When you full rollout, do you backpropagate the average result as 1 visit (so 1 visit and maybe a score of 0.502 or something)
 MSmits: or do you backpropagate 5x win and 7x visits or something
 darkhorse64: I don't perform averaging
 MSmits: mmh ok yeah me neither
 MSmits: doing 1k game test of full rollout vs single rollout atm
 MSmits: so far 100 vs 150, not looking good for full rollout
 MSmits: perhaps i have a bug, but then i had a bug every time i tried this
 darkhorse64: I never performed any thorough tests. Wrote the thing, throw in the UTTT arena, saw it was good for me and never went back
 MSmits: ahhh
 MSmits: my problem is that i much prefer the full rollout version
 darkhorse64: I do too because it avoids lots of checks
 MSmits: maybe i should try doing single rollout when getting a free move
 MSmits: I'll just give all the children 1 free visit to avoid the ucb1 going haywire
 darkhorse64: I even went further for Bandas where I expand two levels in my tree in one iteration (16 full rollouts)
 MSmits: yeah I know, i could not make that second layer work better
 MSmits: but perhaps that is because of my endgame book
 BlaiseEbuth: Hi there! How's your now?
 MSmits: I hope it's worse than my later
 Astrobytes: Better than my earlier
 darkhorse64: I should really do that to cut rollouts but it's a low priority
 MSmits: yeah i kinda did it mostly because i like to code that sort of thing
 Astrobytes: not like you at all!&#160;:)
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Yeah, either you start reading a book or you end up reading a book
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 BlaiseEbuth: So much books. That's not really green
 darkhorse64: They are recycled
 Astrobytes: made out of wasp nests
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. My bad
 Astrobytes: *empty
 MSmits: my books are not green :P
 MSmits: very wasteful
 MSmits: better in the winter though
 meceka: Hi guys. I'm trying to solve algorithm challenges here. I have some knowledge from freecodecamp but even the simplest tasks here seems hard for me and I can't /do it. What do you suggest to me
 darkhorse64: my new checkers engine is faster and I leapfrog the :fish: 
 darkhorse64: :fireworks:
 MSmits: yay
 darkhorse64: half of the bot is the movegen
 MSmits: yeah i know, checkers is hard
 5DN1L: meceka which task have you tried?
 darkhorse64: I bitboarded the thing with a crazy pattern for the board.
 darkhorse64: The 7-8th people are not far away. I should look for a better eval
 MSmits: my eval is super simple
 MSmits: i just count kings and men
 darkhorse64: I rip mine from an opensource checkers program. Although the author says it's only a starting point, it is already quite involved (lots of positional elements)
 darkhorse64: I am guessing my movegen speed is the major factor. I can eval 4M nodes/sec
 jacek: so thats why im not 1st in checkers :rage:
 darkhorse64: Not my fault, recurs e was already first when I submitted
 Aldoggen: his about page says he's retired from CG. he's still first in so many multis lol
 jacek: impossibru
 jacek: darkhorse64 is this cake
 darkhorse64: checkerboard
 darkhorse64: It comes with a "toy" checker program
 darkhorse64: I stole the eval, the movegen is mine
 darkhorse64: lots of sweat to make it work
 jacek: it says its only gui? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/checkerboard.php">http://www.fierz.ch/checkerboard.php</a>
 darkhorse64: there's a checker program source code in the distribution
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/engines.php">http://www.fierz.ch/engines.php</a> Simple checkers
 jacek: you probably saw <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php">http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php</a>
 darkhorse64: Yep. I do not think it's opensource
 darkhorse64: Now in version 1.89
 jacek: still you could probably fine tune your eval this way
 jacek:&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eygilbert/CheckerBoard/blob/master/source/simplech.c#L756">https://github.com/eygilbert/CheckerBoard/blob/master/source/simplech.c#L756</a>
 MSmits: thats nice jacek. I might try that eval at some point
 darkhorse64: I did but I simplify this awful code
 MSmits: must be better than just counting kings and men
 darkhorse64: It is
 MSmits: my sim must be really fast to be 7th with it
 darkhorse64: Just when you seemed within reach, you will escape again ...
 darkhorse64: Or you have a good book
 MSmits: no book
 MSmits: never wrote meta mcts for checkers
 MSmits: bot is just 839 lines
 darkhorse64: I have no TT here
 MSmits: same, i tried, was worse
 MSmits: it's just mcts with ept
 MSmits: no random,  just eval
 darkhorse64: Same with sigmoid function to normalize the eval
 MSmits: i dont normalize
 MSmits: seems like my eval does have some more
 MSmits: it has a "tempo" feature that just gives a bonus for the player who's next to move
 MSmits: and a mobility feature
 MSmits: more score for more moves available
 MSmits: wait no the tempo is how advanced the pieces are
 MSmits: i have a separate turn bonus
 MSmits: soooo many popcounts in my eval :P
 darkhorse64: Your eval is not only material. It's bit more clever
 MSmits: yeah apparently, i was thinking of my previous version, which was like 8th. This was a very minor improvement i think
 MSmits: I wasted a lot of time on checkers, trying stuff, most didnt work
 MSmits: it's also annoying that you cant really do an endgame book for this game
 MSmits: it's too large
 Astrobytes: endless hopping around
 MSmits: well thats a different issue
 MSmits: but yeah thats annoying too
 struct: wont beat the popcnt i have on bt
 struct: ok its not that many
 MSmits: my eval for checkers does 33 times popcount
 struct: 62 for bt
 MSmits: nice
 Tsak5422: hi
 struct: hi
 jacek: welp checkers has 2x less squares than bt
 MSmits: but twice as many different pieces&#160;:)
 struct: Im not even sure if I can write an eval for bt
 struct: I just wrote random things
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: seems full rollout is very clearly worse than single rollout. If I make an exception for free moves (do them as single), the bot becomes better, but still worse than single rollout
 GNye22: Uhhh I hate the optimization test cases....... My code for roller coaster isn't even that time-heavy, only uses 3 loops and still doesnt pass....
 MSmits: 3 loops can be millions of operations
 Astrobytes: and what happens with large test cases with increasing nested loops?
 Astrobytes: that's what you m,ust think about
 GNye22: I only have a single nested loop in the code and thats for simulating each day and checking if there's room on the ride
 MSmits: run it locally with the input provided for the test case, see how long it really runs
 MSmits: maybe it runs forever, because it has a bug
 GNye22: So i'm guessing my issue is where I copy the ride queue into the line queue to ensure the same riders aren't getting on
 GNye22: Shit well that didn't work....
 GNye22: Any tips/tricks for optimizing java code? I already removed the checking of length from the for loop and stored it in a var beforehand and that shaved a few ms off, and condensed an if else into a single boolean expression, but I'm kind of at a loss of what else I can do
 Nerchio: you probably need to use an array or map there
 Nerchio: but i think i googled the solution
 Nerchio: xdd
 GNye22: Do you think it could be because I'm using two objects? One for the coaster and one for the ridequeue?
 5DN1L: have you implemented any cycle detection?
 GNye22: No, I haven't, not sure how I would go about that in this problem, I've never done it before.
 5DN1L: try with a simple case first
 GNye22: What I don't understand is the large dataset one comes in under a second, so idk why it would realistically need to be optimized any further in the real world anyway
 5DN1L: if you implement cycle detection, you can save a lot of loops and computing power :P
 struct: if you wanna brute force rollercoaster
 struct: use javascript
 struct: is chat langing?

 slendersnax: hey guys, has anyone had issues with the c++ compiler?
 struct: not really
 struct: what problem are you having?
 Aldoggen: if it turned into a complainer your code has bugs
 Aldoggen: (sorry)
 slendersnax: nah, i thought so tooso i copied the code over to another compiler online and it worked there?
 Aldoggen: what error message does it give?
 slendersnax: it was one of the certificate exercises, and had issues with the static_cast
 slendersnax: @Aldoggen none, it just wouldn't complete the test case as it showed it got "Nothing" as a result
 struct: ah
 struct: that happens when you print a space at the end
 struct: or an extra \n
 slendersnax: i seeeee
 Aldoggen: a space would do something different
 slendersnax: well trying again in 30 days
 Aldoggen: it's an \n
 slendersnax: thanks
 Aldoggen: a space would compare the lines, and you'd see there was a space in your output

 Astrobytes: overloaded it by accident?
 Astrobytes: or a templating thing?

 DomiKo: struct what game are you doing?
 struct: breakthrough domiko
 struct: I want to try some stuff for early win check
 DomiKo: cooll
 struct: currently from 6th row its possible to check a win
 DomiKo: I have to implement sim for that game&#160;:( 
 struct: I shared this before I think
 DomiKo: maybe
 struct: one sec
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Z720xbK5">https://pastebin.com/Z720xbK5</a>
 struct: If its the player turn
 struct: and that returns 1
 struct: then he has won
 DomiKo: thanks, that will be useful
 struct: you also need to check if player still has pieces
 struct: but wouldnt make sense to add here
 struct: since this one is to check before you move
 struct: Im trying to make it work after you move it will be more usefull
 struct: so basicly this one could be reversed and give hasPlayerLost after he has moved
 DomiKo: make sense
 struct: any progress on oware?
 DomiKo: not really
 DomiKo: my results now seem to be better, but when I submit it to arena, they aren't&#160;:( 
 DomiKo: I have to experiment with some memory optimizations
 struct: I'm sure you will figure it out
 DomiKo: or I will go back to C4
 struct: You already got the hardest part
 DomiKo: or I have like 3K lines of code with bugs :joy:
 struct: you dont use framework for training?
 DomiKo: ofc I use
 DomiKo: I use pytorch
 struct: ah ok
 struct: I thought you went recurse path
 struct: :p
 DomiKo: what is recurse path?
 DomiKo: write eveything?
 struct: yes
 DomiKo: writing my own optimizer... oh no no
 DomiKo: I have like a lot of config stuff
 DomiKo: so right now I have one binary and one yaml config file
 DomiKo: you have to change stuff in config and that's it
 DomiKo: press enter and wait some hours 
 struct: nice
 DomiKo: but for CG I should make things a bit more static, not dynamic
 DomiKo: that would be faster
 struct: wdym by static?
 DomiKo: no dynamic alocation and stuff
 DomiKo: if you have fixed model, I believe you can just make huge array for weights
 DomiKo: and then all weights will be close to each other in memory 
 struct: yeah access will be faster
 DomiKo: and all you really need is optimizer your network
 struct: You use avx in your framework right?
 DomiKo: ofc
 DomiKo: without it's like 6 times slower
 DomiKo: and the same model is much much weaker 
 struct: could always rely on auto vectorization like jacek
 struct: But I would probably do the same
 struct: and avx it
 struct: It should not be that hard
 DomiKo: it kinda does work, but not that well
 DomiKo: yeah it isn't
 struct: i didnt even know that you can do __m256 a; __m256 b; a = a + b;
 struct: on gcc
 DomiKo: ohhh 
 DomiKo: cool
 struct: if you use immintrinh.h
 struct: It will cast it to __v8sf
 struct: But I would not trust this
 struct: I havent really tested it much
 DomiKo: yeah, mixing some low level stuff with high level isn't the best idea

 struct: ok
 struct: I need to forget this stuff
 MSmits: yes that would be best
 Astrobytes: aren't or and and deprecated in C++?
 jacek: or are they?
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I think they did it to keep python programmers away
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: today I found out my school wifi blocks netflix
 MSmits: but it does not block prime and hbo
 MSmits: kind of weird
 nic._.somthing01: sup bieatch
 MSmits: so i can watch the boys but not stranger things
 struct: maybe the blocked it before prime became a thing
 MSmits: yeah, still seems a bit amateurish
 MSmits: i mean why block them at all, when youtube is a thing
 struct: and is it the school that blocks it?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: here almost all schools share the same "system"
 MSmits: not so here
 struct: Its nice, the credentials work in any school
 MSmits: yeah that can be nice
 MSmits: testing fpu atm
 MSmits: or a version of it anyway
 struct: for uttt?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: fpu? :scream:
 MSmits: I tried visiting moves that win boards first
 jacek: it worked well for me
 MSmits: but the performance penalty of splitting the moves (though small) is not worth the gain apparently
 MSmits: but won boards has always been a relatively weak heuristic in uttt, now trying putting moves that give free moves at the end of the line
 struct: FPU is a fancy name for a node eval for the case the node was never visited. We used a value based on a parent node (assuming that eval of children is roughly the same as parent‚Äôs eval). Turned out that AlphaZero just considered unvisited nodes as lost (with very little confidence though)
 struct: Had no idea
 MSmits: it's just move ordering really
 MSmits: like you would with a minimax
 MSmits: visit moves first based on some domain knowledge
 jacek: welp there is/was some mean fpu in one paper that did well
 MSmits: I think it depends a lot on the domain
 jacek: in azero at least you have policy to choose from as first child
 MSmits: yeah policy kind of replaces that
 MSmits: mmh 74 - 57 so far on the fpu setup that avoids giving free moves 
 MSmits: but probability always messes me up with these uttt tests. Most of the time it's nothing or worse
 jacek: confidence interval [2.0%,98.0%]
 MSmits: what does that mean
 struct: i guess 2% confidence that is better
 MSmits: that's not very confident
 MSmits: you need to have a standard deviation for those confidence calcs
 MSmits: i wouldnt know what to use for these games
 jacek: there is some fancy math behind this. how does cgstats calculates those winrate intervals after all?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: but cg stats confidence is nearly 0. It's almost always very few games
 _Royale: hi!
 MSmits: hi _Royale
 struct: hi
 _Royale: MSmits: damn you are high in the C4 leaderboard&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, my bot is very similar to darkhorse and struct, but i added an opening book
 MSmits: not countering anyone specific though, just from running it locally
 jacek: :unamused:
 MSmits: i'm not always nr 1, depends on who submits prolly
 Astrobytes: now now jacek, don't get all rebless-y
 MSmits: I think for the confidence calculations you take 50% as the standard deviation
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.calculator.net/confidence-interval-calculator.html?size=232&amp;mean=53&amp;sd=50&amp;cl=95&amp;x=65&amp;y=19">https://www.calculator.net/confidence-interval-calculator.html?size=232&amp;mean=53&amp;sd=50&amp;cl=95&amp;x=65&amp;y=19</a>
 MSmits: because a lost game is 0 and a won game is 100%
 MSmits: so st.dev of 50 seems reasonable
 MSmits: it gives ridiculous results with lower values for st.dev
 MSmits: with those settings you get an interval of 52-58% if you score 55% after 1000 games
 MSmits: seems reasonable
 YurkovAS: i'm use smart playouts in uttt too
 MSmits: you mean the random playout right?
 YurkovAS: yes
 MSmits: I do as well, it helps
 struct: I dont think I do
 struct: let me check
 MSmits: I prefer winning moves over blockign moves over normal moves
 MSmits: also I keep track of possible wins of the game
 MSmits: so it will always take a winning move
 MSmits: (overall winning move)
 jacek: i had winning small board have 2x chance to be chosen than other moves and winnig game moves were always played
 YurkovAS: i use winning + positional scoringscan't do escape free moves
 struct: oh i still have ctz on uttt but i dont really need it
 MSmits: you mean it cant give away free moves YurkovAS?
 MSmits:  i use ctz a bunch of times
 struct: oh I cant avoid it here i will need to store it anyways
 struct: the index of the board I played at
 MSmits: yeah
 YurkovAS: MSmits i'm can't do escaping free moves
 MSmits: not sure what you mean YurkovAS
 YurkovAS: i mean: i'm not ignore free moves in random playouts
 MSmits: what do you mean ignore?
 MSmits: do you mean you avoid giving away free moves, or you play them equally likely as other moves
 YurkovAS: equally likely as other moves
 MSmits: ahh ok, yes for me it's the same, i make them equally likely also
 MSmits: sigh the fpu thing for avoiding free moves for unvisited nodes helps at most 1% i think
 MSmits: if at all
 MSmits: 267 - 251 now
 struct: how many versions do you test against usually?
 struct: or do you think it doesnt matter much for uttt?
 MSmits: just my best, i dont think it matters much in utttt
 MSmits: because so much random
 MSmits: it would be different if i had an opening book in one of the two versions
 MSmits: if you have some calc time leftover there is a nice theory you can test
 MSmits: my theory is WR for p1 goes up and WR for p2 goes down with better bots
 MSmits: you can do tests with increasing calc time, to see what happen with these WRs
 MSmits: at low calc time it will be near 50-50 i think, at very high calc time, it will be more like 90-10
 struct: but increase calc time for both?
 MSmits: yes both
 MSmits: i also noticed that if you add the teccles heuristic, WR for p1 goes up and WR for p2 goes down
 MSmits: because the bots become better also
 MSmits: (i noticed this in my meta mcts)
 struct: what brought me from 25th to 15th+- was early win check
 MSmits: in random playout or in expansion?
 MSmits: i do both
 struct: both
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: what constitutes early win check&#160;?
 MSmits: there's several levels of this
 struct: I just do 1 simple thing
 jacek: 1-ply win/loss check?
 struct: its not only early win
 MSmits: mine is more like 2-3 plies
 struct: its multiple stuff
 struct: nah mine isnt anything like that
 MSmits: for expansion anyways, 1-2 ply for random playout
 MSmits: do you do the board lookup where if one player has more won boards and the other one cant get 3 in a row anymore?
 struct: yeah
 struct: something like that
 MSmits: ah yeah i got that one too
 struct: I guess its very different
 MSmits: well as i said, there's a ton of levels of sophistication for this, they take more and more performance away in return for more accurate sim or earlier solve 
 MSmits: i err on the side of early solving, because i like to use my bot for meta mcts also
 struct: but how I check if the remaining cant be won its not great
 struct: I just fill the remaining cells as the player
 MSmits: i do this also
 MSmits: it's a fine method
 MSmits: cheap and fast
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: but what i also do in expansion is detect critical boards
 MSmits: where if the opponent can play there, he wins
 MSmits: so i avoid sending him there
 MSmits: this makes you solve several turns sooner, but it's only like 2-3% extra WR
 struct: not in rollout?
 MSmits: in rollout i do detect critical boards but only to finish the game
 MSmits: not to avoid sending opponent thee
 MSmits: i might try this again, it's expensive though
 MSmits: the critical board thing is complicated, because when you finish a board with a teccles move, you also give the opponent a free move
 MSmits: because you're sending him to the board you just finished
 MSmits: have to take that sort of thing into account
 struct: you finish a board if you use teccles?
 struct: o.o
 struct: I had no idea lol
 MSmits: no, you generally dont
 struct: ah ok
 MSmits: i meant a move that has the same square index as board index
 struct: still it doesnt seem very expensive
 MSmits: in early game those are good moves
 MSmits: my expansion functions taken together are 500 lines total :P
 MSmits: they must be at least somewhat expensive
 struct: yeah but making moves that avoid opponent a win
 struct: can be worth
 struct: if its similar to c4
 jacek: but not as expensive as NN prediction :tada:
 MSmits: true jacek
 MSmits: struct yes it is actually similar to c4, but it's more complicated. Way more steps
 MSmits: and i dont just do this
 struct: I will add this to my todo list
 struct: if I ever go back to uttt
 MSmits: i somehow get drawn back in every couple months
 jacek: :imp:
 struct: for preventing giving a winning move
 struct: dont you just need to xor (next_move_win_board | full_board)
 struct: the legal moves you have
 struct: xor it by that
 struct: or something similra
 struct: maybe not xor
 struct: but &amp;~
 MSmits: you also need to know if the opponent has a winning move on the miniboard he lacks to get 3 in a row on the big board
 MSmits: if he doesnt even have 2 in a row there, he doesnt have a critical move
 struct: ah makes sense
 MSmits: and imagine this
 MSmits: say he has those 2 in a row
 MSmits: and lacks 1 critical move
 MSmits: you can still send him to that board and not lose
 struct: why?
 MSmits: if it's the same board you are playing on and you're blocking the 2 in a row =)
 struct: oh
 MSmits: see how this can get complicated&#160;?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: and of course this doesnt work if he has 2(!) winning moves on that board
 MSmits: except of course, when *you* win that board
 MSmits: then you block all his future moves on that board
 jacek: if there was a way to automate those kind of decisions...
 MSmits: yes, a giant opening book
 jacek: :head_bandage:
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: i actually do have an endgame book of sorts for uttt. But only when theres 1 board left
 MSmits: so it's basically a normal TTT lookup
 MSmits: i guess it helps with games that tend to end in a draw. Makes sure you play them out perfectly for the last 3 moves or so
 MSmits: I tried coming up with a 2 board endgame book but it would already be enormous
 struct: does 1 board left book even help?
 MSmits: doubtful, i think it helps solve sooner
 MSmits: but dont think it helps win more
 MSmits: solving doesnt necessarily make your bot better. If you dont solve but the winning moves still get the highest score, it's fine
 struct: i wonder how big bt end game book would be
 MSmits: that said, i just turned off my sophisticated expansion for a basic expansion function and got 43% WR
 MSmits: but thats a ton of features all at once
 struct: maybe even bugs
 MSmits: i dont think bt endgame book can work
 MSmits: yes struct, maybe bugs
 MSmits: for endgame book you need a converging game
 MSmits: (states get simpler near the end)
 MSmits: uttt sort of has this but only for drawn games or nearly drawn games
 MSmits: checkers has it, chess has it, oware has it
 MSmits: othello does not really
 _Royale: jacek: aren't all NNs giant opening books in disguise?
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: shhh!
 MSmits: _Royale ideally they arent because they're supposed to generalize, but research has shown that it has enormous potential for memorization
 jacek: well, having 'extended' solver for bt helps
 struct: extended solver?
 MSmits: I think they tested it by making a NN remember totally unrelated random numbers
 MSmits: and it could remember a lot of them 
 jacek: you can solve 3-ply or even 5-ply win/losses with bunch of ifs or fancy bitboard operatins
 jacek: operations even
 MSmits: yeah with triangle shape bit extractions right?
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: on opponent side of the board
 struct: ok 4 row TB idea is discarded
 struct: a 4 row tablebase would be approximately 1.1 √ó 10^11.
 Crosility: Been gone for a few days, but back! Howdy, how has everyone been?
 MSmits: struct i think you generally look up in triangle shaped pattern in front of each forward pawn
 MSmits: not all rows at once
 MSmits: hi Crosility, i've been ok
 MSmits: you/
 struct: yeah I was just reading <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://scholarworks.csun.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.3/174085/Isaac-Andrew-thesis-2016.pdf">https://scholarworks.csun.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.3/174085/Isaac-Andrew-thesis-2016.pdf</a>
 jacek: well i look at the attacked squares and if i can go into unatttacked ones
 Crosility: Seeing family was aight, but been having major car trouble. Just been a pain getting a wrench on everything and fixing it. Thanks MSmits. It's nice seeing you guys in chat. :D
 struct: whats the max row you can check from jacek?
 jacek: 6th? (out of 8)
 MSmits: I don't even have a car, or a drivers license
 struct: did you use this before the NN?
 MSmits: I use trains and bicycles
 MSmits: and feet
 Crosility: Love me ol' bicycles and foot power.
 MSmits: indeed
 Crosility: Just not easy to do here in the states.
 Crosility: Was much easier in Japan.
 MSmits: no, your public transportation is crap
 jacek: struct im still using now, but it doesnt improve much except for solving sooner
 jacek: NN can do that
 MSmits: here it's great unless you live in some village
 MSmits: in a city you can get anywhere quick
 struct: so you just check all attacked cells?
 struct: I guess it makes sense
 jacek: yes
 struct: maybe I could add that
 Crosility: Lucky :DYou talking about the fire spreader jacek and struct?
 struct: no, breakthrough
 MSmits: no, breakthrough game
 MSmits: 482-440 now on the fpu avoiding free moves
 MSmits: i wonder if it's better or not
 Crosility: Oh, Interesting, a simplified checkers?
 MSmits: not checkers
 MSmits: more like chess with only pawns
 MSmits: and no promotion
 struct: oh they had to book 3rd row :D
 MSmits: and freeer movement
 struct: I dont need it
 struct: simple sim but hard to eval
 struct: I would say impossible
 Crosility: What do you mean?
 Crosility: Can't do tree-simulation logic?
 MSmits: it's simple to keep track of what happens in the game when you apply a move
 struct: Hard to give a value to the current game
 MSmits: but it's hard to know whether a board state is good for player 1 or player 2 or anywhere in between
 Astrobytes: threat analysis, defence strength etc
 jacek: try piece-square tables. but also attacking/attacked pawns or defending are important
 struct: as a human its easy
 struct: but I cant translate it to eval
 MSmits: the problem is the interconnectedness of the pawn lines
 Astrobytes: whta jacek said
 Astrobytes: *what
 struct: I even have eval for "tempo"
 MSmits: as a human you kinda do it the same way as a NN, you look at the whole picture
 MSmits: you dont chop it up
 MSmits: I'm not even going to try improving my bt until i can do it with a nn eval
 MSmits: seems hopeless to me
 Crosility: WOW, this leaderboard is mostly C++
 MSmits: all boardgames are
 struct: bitboards
 Nerchio: and what isn't mostly C++
 struct: ghost in the shell
 MSmits: c++ and rust are the fastest languages
 Crosility: Lol, true Nerchio
 MSmits: but rust doesnt have many players using it
 jacek: and 4 top players are quite ahead of the others :thinking:
 Astrobytes: damn, dropped to 28th
 Astrobytes: Need to get back to that one
 struct: top 4 should have their own league
 struct: oh but im above 1 NN
 struct: by 0.01
 jacek: another NN?
 MSmits: have to be careful about drawing conclusions about c++ being at the top. Sometimes it's because the language is fast, sometimes it's just because the best players like using it (because they're used to it)
 struct: jolindien jacek
 jacek: huh
 struct: yes
 struct: I believe it is a NN
 struct: I have no proof
 struct: but C#, is oware is also C#
 struct: his*
 struct: also his C4
 jacek: if its NN why it is so low :v
 MSmits: Games played: 1000Player 1 wins: 521 (52,1%)Player 2 wins: 479 (47,9%)
 MSmits: so... is it better?
 struct: maybe he just gave pawns as inputs?
 MSmits: Nerchio there are many games where performance is not an issue
 Nerchio: yes but C++ is fast thats all I said :P
 struct: Nerchio some games it doesnt matter at all
 MSmits: correct
 struct: I wasted so much time on c4 performance for 0% gain
 struct: besides knowledge
 MSmits: i've stopped doing that
 struct: 0% gain on rank
 struct: the performance was better
 MSmits: it's much better to think about ways to do smart rollout and pruning and such
 struct: yes
 struct: pruning moves is massive
 struct: even for mcts
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: anyway gonna get some sleep again. More uttt experimentation tomorrow!
 struct: same
 struct: gn 
 MSmits: gn
 Astrobytes: gn
 Ahmed_King: start
 Solidaritii: does js have an exuivalent method to python's maketrans?
 Crosility: There's a joke in there somewhere. But I'm not going to make it.&#160;:]
 Crosility: Something like this crass? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/js-mapping-tables/">https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/js-mapping-tables/</a>
 Crosility: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp</a> &lt;- Can use forEach on a loop for the mapping table.
 Crosility: Is not "the same", but quite similar in use as Pythons maketrans
 Darleanow: Hey every1&#160;:)
 Scollier: hi!

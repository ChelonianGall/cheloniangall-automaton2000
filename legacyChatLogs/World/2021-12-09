 UZUHAMA: This code vs zombies thing is making me insane
 Thorcode: that's question I think have no ans
 AlkhilJohn.: damn
 Thorcode: like the bird or egg was born first
 AlkhilJohn.: a smooth block of code

 Thorcode: bruh
 Considerably_Disagreeable: what if input is like "hello"
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: or True
 AlkhilJohn.: bruh
 AlkhilJohn.: Try The Canadian Computing Competition
 AlkhilJohn.: Do the Senior one
 Thorcode: the what?
 AlkhilJohn.: If you can get at least 3 problems in an hour, you are a decent coder.
 Thorcode: bruh the statement of that look like a big mess
 AlkhilJohn.: lol ok whatever u fucking think
 Thorcode: nah I just tell the truth
 Thorcode: messer than codingame
 Thorcode: but some algo is ezer than codingame
 UZUHAMA: EYEYEYYYYEEEEEESSSS
 UZUHAMA: FINALLLLYYYY
 UZUHAMA: IT"S WORKING
 UZUHAMA: Thank God
 UZUHAMA: Even though my score is pathetic
 UZUHAMA: It's working, at least!!!
 Oroppo: Curious as to how this works
 Oroppo: looks fun

 Dren: I don't think I can tell you the answer
 Rudeus-scanf: ตู่
 C26_1: um
 C26_1: Can I ask
 C26_1: I try to make a while loop to read a inp file till the end of a file

 Thorcode: use trimp() bro
 gamerrboii: i cant get past level 2 in the ai
 gamerrboii: it where i need to do stuff with nextcheckpointangle
 gamerrboii: do you guys know what a easy level is?
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 gamerrboii: im new and i need something easy to begin with
 Thorcode: ah mad pod race
 YajPinkNinja: can i choose which clash of code mode i want to play somewhere? so i only play that mode
 JonasOi: Yo where do I find some actually easy stuff on this site
 Urutar: Public Clash of Code mode is random; you have to start a private clash with someone to choose the mode
 Thorcode: yep YajPinkNinja but you must play private
 Urutar: Easy puzzles can be found here:
 YajPinkNinja: ah alright thanks
 Urutar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Urutar: And you can find more here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 Urutar: Otherwise, just hover over Activities and click practice
 iQuack: Aight, and where are the even easier one because im looking at this and it's still too hard
 Urutar: Chose another easy one - some of them are harder than others
 Urutar: Which one are you struggling with?
 derjack: temperatures, the descent are one of the easiest
 Thorcode: chose ez with out player name
 Thorcode: or power of thor
 derjack: pot :o
 Thorcode: power of thor ep 1
 derjack: they didnt change the name yet
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: why do they need to change the name of it
 derjack: maybe not the name because its some myth. but graphics are marvelish
 Canoob: HELLO
 Urutar: I suppose mabye for copyright reasons?
 Thorcode: I think so
 derjack: so you need to change your nick ~
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: what happen with my
 Thorcode: nick
 derjack: its copyright violation :V
 Thorcode: reallly
 Thorcode: who will report me with marvel
 derjack: me
 derjack: :imp:
 Thorcode: how?
 Thorcode: :money_mouth:
 Urutar: You do realize that the name Thor precedes Marvel?
 Thorcode: nah I don't think marvel will care this
 Uljahn: just report him back with hasbro :smirk:
 Thorcode: really
 Thorcode: ah I will report him with ponny
 Thorcode: ah it's hasbro
 Thorcode: Thanks Uljahn
 derjack: and ill report to kyoto animation
 Thorcode:&#160;? why kyoto here
 derjack: some catty business
 Urutar: You will al be reported to the Greek pantheon then&#160;;)
 Thorcode: problem with string kinda trash
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: i'll report to Greenpeace for abusing anime animal rights
 Automaton2000: eulerschezahl do you know how to save the day
 Thorcode: ah yeah Automaton2000 beats eulerschezahl
 Automaton2000: my issue is that you get on the bomb input is from enemy is owner, source, and type. everything else ...
 Thorcode: have AutomatonNN dead
 Thorcode: I could not chat with that AutomatonNN
 Thorcode: THe resistance is not as ez as I though
 5DN1L: There are reasons for that puzzle to be classified as Very Hard, yeah?
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: although I know that that puzzle use moorse
 5DN1L: I guess the difficulty of the classical puzzles (i.e. those listed in the achievements) are more fairly classified than the community puzzles
 Thorcode: yeah the community is supper hard
 5DN1L: i mean the difficulty of the community puzzle may not always be a fair reflection, it may be higher or lower than how difficult it actually is
 5DN1L: but the difficulty of the classical puzzles is quite appropriately set
 Thorcode: like code breaker
 Thorcode: that puzzle should be hard
 Thorcode: or medium
 5DN1L: Wait until you see more complex ones :smirk:
 Thorcode: ok
 5DN1L: Difficulty is comparatively speaking
 5DN1L: The success rate is a more subjective mesaure of difficulty than just the views of the community puzzle creator, moderators and test-coders
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, what do you think of the difficulty of the puzzles on Codingame?
 Automaton2000: you know my languages is python
 5DN1L: That's just one language, not languages. And it's a totally irrelevant answer, sad
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: wait what the resitance success rate is higher than power of thor 2
 Jerrasterix: yeah, resistance is easy, the only problem is optimizing it for large messages 
 Thorcode: really
 Jerrasterix: I mean, the puzzle is easy but optimizing it for large msg. is very hard
 Thorcode: ah
 Thorcode: I could not even change morse to text
 Jerrasterix: yeah, I did it when I knew only some concepts still I got a solid 50%
 Jerrasterix: I am still at 50% :P
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/595475671">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/595475671</a>
 Thorcode: still got 5 giant&#160;:(
 Urutar: Have ya tried evading to the top or bottom, so they follow you and clump up?
 Thorcode: or go straight to them
 Thorcode:&#160;:)
 Urutar: But when you're close, try evading upwards, then they'll clump up
 Thorcode: like distance =10?
 Urutar: Something like that
 Thorcode: the horde is super hard
 Thorcode: is there any easy puzzle in hard?
 5DN1L: You look for the puzzles which have been solved by more people
 Urutar: Well, this one was relatively simple to solve for me:
 Urutar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/highest-truncated-pyramid">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/highest-truncated-pyramid</a>
 Thorcode: ah I know how to do resistance
 Thorcode: change all of the words below to moorse
 Thorcode: yeah I got 20%
 DialFrost: wats the logic behind highest truncated pyramid
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 DialFrost: the puzzle
 DialFrost: wats to logic behind it to solve it
 Thorcode: --.-------..['--.', '--.', '--', '--.', '....']
 Thorcode: wait what why the second test case has 1
 Thorcode: code = {'A': '.-', <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1bf821a0-0764-4750-8ce8-5d3a85925797">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1bf821a0-0764-4750-8ce8-5d3a85925797</a>

 Thorcode: def createDict(): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/334c39b7-740f-4a7e-a7e5-86f0716f389a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/334c39b7-740f-4a7e-a7e5-86f0716f389a</a>
 Thorcode: this is all of my code error
 Thorcode: IndentationError: unexpected unindent
 Uljahn: the error is somewhere else, not in this code
 Thorcode: ah I found it I use try but no except
 Thorcode: thanks Uljahn
 Uljahn: also this function makes no sense
 Thorcode: ah I just made a dic to change from text to moorse
 5DN1L: Just define the dictionary like your first code does. You don't have to def createDict to define and return it.
 Uljahn: yep, the function way looks like overengineering without reasonable profits compared to an assignment to a global variable
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: I just copy a part of my code
 RandomAustralian: agsduiasgdiuas
 RandomAustralian: the amount of time I went
 RandomAustralian: thinking that "not" was not valid in c++
 RandomAustralian: cause the syntax wasn't highlighted
 RandomAustralian:&#160;;-;
 5DN1L: Syntax highlighting in CG IDE may not always be correct
 AshishRegmi: hello
 DialFrost: hai
 Jerrasterix: yeah, C# codes are not even getting highlighted as before 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: huh, so I fully understood encrypted decrypted my own messages using the ceasar cipher, for the question its a shift 3, *1 %26 why is the first encrypted message, that is "hello world", not the correct encryption?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: hello world in the ceasar cipher is, Khoor zruog
 Considerably_Disagreeable: not IFMMPAXPSME
 Considerably_Disagreeable: u have multiple different shifts for the letters, when its only a 3 shift encryption.. atleast for ceasars cipher
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if its not a 3 step shift, then its simply not even comparable to ceasars cipher...
 Considerably_Disagreeable: simply is not
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its a different formula
 Dr.Speedy: guys
 Dr.Speedy: help me out with mad pod racing
 Jerrasterix: Considerably_Disagreeable its based on Caesar cipher not caesar cipher itself
 Jerrasterix: Dr.Speedy what do you want&#160;??
 Dr.Speedy: i cant seem to see where to add the thrust
 Considerably_Disagreeable: so then whats the formula? @Jerrasterix
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because its not x+A*B%26
 Jerrasterix: its ((X+A)*B)%26
 Considerably_Disagreeable: B is 1
 Considerably_Disagreeable: meaning it is the ceasar cipher
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because b is 1
 Dr.Speedy:  Edit this line to output the target position
 Jerrasterix: A need not be 3 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: the first few questions are the ceasar cipher
 TheUmgawa: Wasn't it 27, because of the space? I don't want to bother digging up my code for that one right now.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because b is 1
 Jerrasterix: it can be anything 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i am excluding the space
 Considerably_Disagreeable: what i am saying is, is that the shift is literally wrong
 Dr.Speedy: this the code that im strugling with  Edit this line to output the target position
 Considerably_Disagreeable: because since b is 1, its shift 3
 Considerably_Disagreeable: which is ceasars cipher
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if b was different
 Considerably_Disagreeable: then it is not ceasars cipher
 TheUmgawa: Are you getting hung up on history or something?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: the question states, the first few answers are ceasars cipher but its not?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: its not even encrypted using the same shift
 Jerrasterix: nope A=1 for some...
 Considerably_Disagreeable: which its supposed to be
 Considerably_Disagreeable: for ceasar cipher, A!=1
 Considerably_Disagreeable: thats not ceasars cipher
 Jerrasterix: YES It is not CAESAR CIPHER 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: really
 Considerably_Disagreeable: the question states this, The first 4 test cases have B=1 and therefore can be solved using a simple Caesar cipher.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: if its not ceasar cipher then why is it saying its using it?
 TheUmgawa: It's a Caesar shift, not Caesar's cipher. You can shift it by one, by three, by 24, whatever you want, and it's just a Caesar shift.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: thats not a ceasar shift. Thats a randomized shift.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: and its simple wrong, to state that it can besolved with a ceasar shift
 Jerrasterix: First of all who told caesar shift is shift by 3&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: its a common shift not the only shift 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: pretty positive ceasar didnt have a PRN
 TheUmgawa: I think we have different definitions of "random." Shifting all of the letters of the alphabet unilaterally has zero element of randomness to it.
 TheUmgawa: Or wait, the Ovaltine decoder ring is a random cipher!
 Considerably_Disagreeable: You are getting to technicalities, such as a question like, I dont think we just breath just oxygen
 TheUmgawa: You're getting into technicalities about Caesar ciphers, when it's obvious to everyone else in the room that it's just a plain ol' Caesar shift until B changes to something other than 1.
 Jerrasterix: Considerably_Disagreeable I would like to know what you understand abt it&#160;??
 Considerably_Disagreeable: did u like not read my code @jerrasterix
 Considerably_Disagreeable: hmmmm
 Jerrasterix: you never shared code 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: i did
 TheUmgawa: While B = 1, Ralphie from A Christmas Story could decode the message with his Little Orphan Annie decoder ring, as long as he knows what the shift number is. And if he doesn't, it's going to take a maximum of 26 attempts, assuming it's not plaintext to begin with.
 Jerrasterix: never have you ever shared it 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: pretty positive i did, but here it is again The first 4 test cases have B=1 and therefore can be solved using a simple Caesar cipher.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: lul wrong paste
 Considerably_Disagreeable: def _decrypt(cipher): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f02a26e-60a4-4fc9-96bb-3fd9403d4c15">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f02a26e-60a4-4fc9-96bb-3fd9403d4c15</a>
 TheUmgawa: Why on earth would you hardcode 3 in there?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: well after u explained yourself TheUmgawa it does seem quite riduculous 
 Considerably_Disagreeable: god that spelling
 Jerrasterix: may I know who told you that the caesar cipher has only 3 as shift value??
 TheUmgawa: The ghost of Julius Caesar, I hope. At least this story will get more interesting.
 Jerrasterix: Its there right, not your prob...
 Jerrasterix: well it must have been a ghost of a prankster bcoz a caesar cipher can have any value(0 to inifinity) as shift 
 5DN1L: any value less than infinity and more than negative infinity
 Considerably_Disagreeable: So, you are making fun of me because I used a static value, for the shift value?
 Considerably_Disagreeable: How is that not trash?
 Uljahn: re-read the statement carefully, Considerably_Disagreeable
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I dont take kindly to being made fun of
 Considerably_Disagreeable: you guys are wrong
 Uljahn: stop trolling or ban
 Considerably_Disagreeable: im not trolling, how is that trolling?
 5DN1L: Considerably_Disagreeable, relax and take a deep breath.
 5DN1L: We'll help you
 5DN1L: But please calm down.
 TheUmgawa: Now, now, no need to ban anyone. I think he's just confuzzled.
 Considerably_Disagreeable: I just dont like to be made fun of...
 Urutar: They're not, they're just confused why there is a hardcoded value in there
 Considerably_Disagreeable: ima go take a breather
 Urutar: And who ever told you that that's necessary should be reprimanded, since that's bad teaching.
 Urutar: In case someone did tell you.
 TheUmgawa: Because that (i-3) value is always going to return the same thing. It might be right in one case, but it's going to be wrong in every other case.
 Urutar: Exactly
 Urutar: The shift value needs to shift aswell and that'S not confusing at all XD
 TheUmgawa: Of course, my code for that problem was four helper functions and a tester. No sense in trying to get everything done in one function, I think, especially when it has to rattle through a bunch of possibilities.
 Jerrasterix: He misunderstood that caeser cipher must only have 3 as the shift value 
 TheUmgawa: Yeah, that's what it came down to.
 Urutar: Well, he'll figure it out, or we'll be there to help him.
 Urutar: Surrender is not an option XD
 5DN1L: I agree with you, Urutar
 handrianina: Who finished the Bracket Extended Edition&#160;:)
 5DN1L: According to the statistics, 692 coders finished it. I don't think you need the whole list of who they are :joy:
 5DN1L: What's your question about it
 derjack: enhanced edition?
 handrianina: Struggling with the algo :grimacing:
 5DN1L: Extended, enhanced, ultimate, extreme &lt;- 4 puzzles derjack
 5DN1L: handrianina What have you come up with so far?
 derjack: huh
 derjack: talking about exp farming...
 C26_1: Ah
 5DN1L: lol derjack
 C26_1: I have an idea
 C26_1: I'm gonna make a puzzle that is related to Covid-19 (or disease in general)
 handrianina: Like the position of the opening bracket and the position of its closing or himself&#160;:)
 handrianina: Nice C26_1
 5DN1L: handrianina and...?
 handrianina: Too long here...
 5DN1L: a general idea of how you handle the input
 5DN1L: not the code
 C26_1: but
 C26_1: It's very hard to explain though
 C26_1: I need someone
 C26_1: I don't very good at choosing word
 handrianina: 5DN1L Split the expression and check every  char ...
 5DN1L: ok, so you've got all the positions of the brackets, yeah? what next?
 derjack: brackets.. is this some state machine thing?
 5DN1L: Goal: Decide whether an expression contain valid bracket pairs (by flipping some/all of them if necessary)
 5DN1L: contains*
 C26_1: @5DN1L, do you means this bracket expression (()()) is valid?
 C26_1: And ()())( is invalid?
 5DN1L: The question is not valid or not by itself.
 5DN1L: The question is whether it is possible to become valid or not
 C26_1: ah
 C26_1: ok
 KareemDev: amira 
 C26_1: So ()())( is possible input
 C26_1: ()())( =&gt; ()()() (Flip the 5th and 6th bracket)
 C26_1: ok
 5DN1L: Yes

 C26_1: I'm gonna tell a  classic puzzle made by me
 C26_1: This is maybe related to disease
 C26_1: 0 9 1 21 4 5 23 5 6 1
 C26_1: This is an example of a 'crowd'
 C26_1: Where each number represent the 'HP' or how resist they are compared to Covid-19
 C26_1: 0 is a special character where it represent an infected person
 derjack: but are they resistant to Covid-26_1
 C26_1: The goal is to find how many step needed that all person will be infected
 C26_1: So we gonna have 3 inputs
 C26_1: The width, the height, and the strong of the virus at each step
 C26_1: So, I'm choosing virus-ATK as 1, for simplycity

 C26_1: simplicity*
 C26_1: Step 1: Cell (1,1) is infect the cell (1,2) and cell (2,1)
 NotANick: Which puzzles using recursive functions in answers? I need grinding with recursive
 C26_1: So the crowd now look like this:0 8 1 20 4 5 23 5 6 1
 5DN1L: NotANick <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/brackets-extended-edition">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/brackets-extended-edition</a>
 NotANick: thanks
 C26_1: Step 2: Cell (1,1) infect with cell (2,1). Cell (1,2) infect cell (2,2) and cell (1,3)
 C26_1: So now the crowd look like this:0 7 1 20 3 5 22 5 6 1
 C26_1: You know what I mean
 C26_1: It will continue until all people has a number 0
 C26_1: That means all people will be infected
 5DN1L: NotANick You may also look up "recursion" here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html</a>

 MIPSTER: happy new year
 Overbed:&#160;?
 C26_1: Wait
 Overbed: 5dn1l can you help me with this clash of code?
 C26_1: MIPSTER, Do you realize that this is 09/12/2021 and we need to wait 23 days to get Happy New Year firework?
 C26_1: Sadly, there will be no firework anymore
 lakaoe: sadly
 5DN1L: Overbed, please ask your question here, and see who can help you here (maybe me or others)&#160;:)
 Overbed: John's task is to plant as many trees as he can in a square gridOne tree takes up 2x2 spacesInputAn integer n Length of one side of a square
 Overbed: so this means it takes 2 squares
 C26_1: I don't know how Covid-19 affects everyone's personality and life
 C26_1: With me, it affects me a lot
 Overbed: what does this mean that input is?
 Overbed: C26_1 our country is handling it good i'd say so it isnt really affecting my life 
 C26_1: Input: 6-&gt; Each tree needs 6x6 square to plant
 Overbed: ohhh
 C26_1: Find the maximum number of trees you can planted
 Overbed: huh
 Overbed: Input2Output1
 Overbed: so it needs 2x2 here to plant?
 lakaoe: it needs anytime i think
 amin3919: Where I can see the answers
 Overbed: you cant
 amin3919: why?
 Overbed: o nly poeple who share it at the end of clash of code or in contribution
 Overbed: idk why
 amin3919: ok thx
 Overbed: how to make the input that codingame uses(like slight_smile) turn into&#160;:)?
 Uljahn: it also turns :_/ and :_\ (without _) into&#160;:/
 C26_1: Oh
 C26_1: Hello
 C26_1: Uljahn, I have a idea for a new puzzle
 Uljahn: hm, also :confused&#160;:
 Uljahn: C26_1: show me the code
 C26_1: But it's fairly hard to explain it properly just using text
 Overbed: yes uljahn what function can i use to check if  the input includes something like slight_smile?
 C26_1: Ok I'm out
 Uljahn: looks like pattern matching
 Overbed: i cant use count or for loop cz i want it to print it out can i
 C26_1: Can I ask something?
 C26_1: Example:3 4 51 2 34 6 2
 C26_1: What does programmer called that?
 C26_1: A 2d-array or a field of numbers?
 C26_1: Cuz I need the tag for my future contribution
 lakaoe: how to look what the lowest integer is in a code
 Overbed: for i in range(...):
 lakaoe: like if its 3, 4, 70
 C26_1: Either using lowest number algorithm or using built-in method min() of Python standard libraries applied in an Array to get a result
 lakaoe: it says its 3
 C26_1: For example:
 Overbed: how do you use min()
 C26_1: print(min(Array))
 Overbed: cant u use sorted() for that
 C26_1: I think if you want
 C26_1: print(sort(Array)[1])
 C26_1: That kind of nested function is kind of nasty
 Kailynn: nah
 C26_1: print(sort(Array)[0])
 C26_1: I'm doing it wrong again
 C26_1: Why would programmers invented the first element as 0-index?
 Overbed: no idead
 C26_1: I think it will be way easier if programmer invented the first element in an array has index number 1 and so on
 PolentaEater: C26_1 also you don't use sort that way. either a.sort(); print(a) or print(sorted(a))
 Kailynn: ok
 C26_1: Ah
 C26_1: I see
 C26_1: I found an anwser

 C26_1: magicKULA, you don't need to paste the link
 C26_1: The address to store an element is represented in binary. If we started counting at 1 instead of 0 then If will have an extra leading digit
 C26_1: For example, if you have an array that has 8 element, computer will store the element from address 0 to 8 (which is, 0 and 111 respectively in binary)
 PolentaEater: C26_1 about tags: when you edit the tag field of your contribution, you get tag suggestions. If I am unsure, I  search for existing problems that use the same tags. I think this is good practice, because it avoids generating new tags when similar ones already exist, ore using existing tags with a different meaning
 Uljahn: "2D Array" might be a good match
 C26_1: Ok

 derjack: Oo
 NotANick: I dont really understand why my code isn't working can anybody help me?
 NotANick: for Brackets, Extended Edition
 camnwalter: whaddup peeps
 DHenricks: waddup
 trebel: Anyone familiar with C? Have a project I'm stuck on and need a little push
 jacek: git push

 trebel: LMAO
 trebel: bookmarked 
 BlaiseEbuth: :upside_down:
 derjack: Automaton2000 do you even push
 Automaton2000: that doesnt help me at all
 derjack: i gave up, i used nn in 9mm
 GoodPuffer: what
 GoodPuffer: i dont even get it what i have to do with strings
 GoodPuffer: on C++
 GoodPuffer: guys whats the easiest coding language
 NotANick: script languages
 Uljahn: easiest is no code
 GoodPuffer: but i want to learn about C++
 GoodPuffer: but i dont understand what i hav eto do with strnig on clash of code
 NotANick: have a look at rust
 NotANick: the language one
 NotANick: not game
 GoodPuffer: ok
 Wontonimo: he is trolling you
 NotANick: no i am really not
 NotANick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">https://www.rust-lang.org/</a>
 NotANick: rust written with c++
 Wontonimo: C++ is a great language but it can be hard for new developers.  Are you new to coding GoodPuffer&#160;?
 Uljahn: managing strings in c++ is so much harder than in python
 NotANick: fastest as c++ and easiest as js people say this about rust
 GoodPuffer: wontaonmio
 GoodPuffer: yes am new in coding
 GoodPuffer: wontonimo
 Uljahn: why c++ then?
 GoodPuffer: hmm
 GoodPuffer: good question
 GoodPuffer: well
 GoodPuffer: why not
 Uljahn: that's pretty hardcore
 GoodPuffer: people said that C++ was good
 GoodPuffer: so yea
 GoodPuffer: but this game has bad tutorial in my opinion
 GoodPuffer: cozat beginning it says what u can to do but then the next one of the beginning (step 2)
 InCog: if you are new to coding
 InCog: this aint the site
 GoodPuffer: oh
 InCog: the beginner puzzles
 GoodPuffer: hmmm
 DylanGTech: This is a good debate to have actually: I started with Java/C#. My community college actually started students with C
 InCog: require quite abit of skill
 GoodPuffer: oh
 InCog: like
 GoodPuffer: but what website can i learn 
 InCog: knowledge
 InCog: codecademy
 InCog: good for the very basics
 GoodPuffer: ok thank you
 InCog: then pick up a project
 InCog: and practice
 DylanGTech: C is good for fundamentals of computing like memory and such. Not very good for abstract concepts or ease of use
 InCog: then afterwards if you wanna test your skill or knowledge come here and practice
 DylanGTech: As a beginner language
 GoodPuffer: oh ok thnak you
 DylanGTech: @InCog there is the Learn page. Hope I'm not writing entire tutorials there for nothing :P
 InCog: c# seems very good for beginners
 Wontonimo: here is a walkthough of making tic-tac-toe in the web <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA</a>  it's a really good video and may be really fun for you to see stuff actually working
 InCog: at least for me
 Wontonimo: it's by "the coding train" who has literally thousands of videos
 InCog: DylanGTech Its good but if you wanna learn there are tons of other better sites
 InCog: meant specifically
 InCog: for learning
 InCog: this is more like enrichment and learning new concepts
 DylanGTech: I love C#. Performance-wise, it tries. But C# and especially newer versions of .NET make it SO GOOD for focusing on the code, and improving logic
 InCog: You get what I am saying
 DylanGTech: Oh yeah, definitely
 InCog: c# feels so intuitive 
 InCog: compared to js
 InCog: js feels so easy 
 InCog: but so hard to understand
 InCog: reading code is nigh impossible unless you wrote it or its well written
 DylanGTech: Speaking of intuition, I actually have the urge to try new languages with new concepts, even if they make me wanna scream lol
 DylanGTech: Zig has so much potential imo
 DylanGTech: But progress on that language is slow, and it's extremely unstable
 InCog: I probably have to get the basics of c# down before I can think about that
 GoodPuffer: how do i get tutorial on codecadamy
 InCog: @GoodPuffer just click the language you want
 GoodPuffer: ok
 GoodPuffer: but i dont see anytutorial
 InCog: theres no tutorial its just lessons
 DylanGTech: I actually learned Java as my first language on CaveOfProgramming, back when his lessons were free
 InCog: the lessons are the tutorial
 GoodPuffer: what
 GoodPuffer: so its like only for people with knowledge?
 InCog: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/">https://www.codecademy.com/courses/</a>
 InCog: no
 GoodPuffer: oh
 InCog: its to learn
 DylanGTech: CodeAcademy is to learn, Codingame is to practice.
 DylanGTech: Think of it like that
 Wontonimo: hint GoodPuffer&#160;: once you find some tutorials/examples/lessons that you like, don't just keep moving to the next lessons week after week.  Instead, redo lessons until you can nearly do it from memory and reflex before moving on.
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces is to compete
 GoodPuffer: ok thank you
 DylanGTech: Wontonimo I actually have a similar, yet different approach: I prefer explaining things and having users understand the fundamentals of the language, and explain to death why things are that way. Extra work, but it affords newbies flexibility going forward. If they wanna use tuples for literally everything instead of classes, they can do that (AND understand why that might be a bad idea lol)
 DylanGTech: My C# tutorials on the Learn page are a bit slow to go through, but they are full of examples
 DylanGTech: Or rather, based heavily around examples
 InCog: You know what
 InCog: I will actually look through them
 InCog: I have never been there
 InCog: but that sounds really useful 
 InCog: compared to just learning syntax in abstract context
 DylanGTech: Like, explaining how a variable is literally a piece of the computer's memory, with an arbitrary name and purpose, took a lot longer than I thought
 DylanGTech: InCog I personaly only have 2 tutorials up so far, and they are geared at absolute beginners who installed the compiler on their own, but I'm certain a lot of people can learn a thing or two. Something I found out by accident is that there is a LOT of demand for tutorials on this site for languages
 InCog: yeah thats what I am 
 InCog: just started programming after a 2 year hiatus
 DylanGTech: Welcome then&#160;:)
 DylanGTech: My tone in those is very humor-based. Makes it fun for me, and will probably keep the attention of any students
 DylanGTech: Especially younger ones
 Wontonimo: js and c# are really quite different.  One is a prototyping lang, and one is an object oriented language.
 InCog: yeah
 InCog: the difference is stark
 Wontonimo: once you wrap your head around prototyping it is really quite nice.  personally I miss the flexability of js when using other langs
 DylanGTech: Despite my love for C#, jobs and applications that require fully-compiled languages and tiny, efficient code might be where I end up working long-term. Hence why I LOVE niche up-and-coming languages like Zig. It's basically everything C SHOULD be
 DylanGTech: They don't have classes, but they allow you to do SO much more with structs and enums
 DylanGTech: Large default library too, and functions/structs can be nested
 DylanGTech: Just buggy as all heck
 DylanGTech: Maybe in a few years it will be usable in production cases
 BlaiseEbuth: Potatos and carrots are really quite different. One is used in fast-foods, and one is orange.
 Wontonimo: i see you haven't participated in many multis or optimization competitions DylanGTech. 
 Wontonimo: if you like working with efficient code give Ultimate Tic Tac Toe or Connect 4 a try
 Mortis_666: hi
 DylanGTech: You're right Wontonimo. I unfortunately don't do a ton here. Besides writing tutorials, chatting with you all, and the occasional Clash of Code
 DylanGTech: I attempted that Nintendo encryption challenge recently
 InCog: Wontonimo yeah completely agree thats one aspect of js I love
 InCog: the flexibility it provides
 DylanGTech: I came REALLY close, but I ran out of time irl, and I wanted to go to bed lol
 Wontonimo: heck, Tron (now called Line Racing) may also be fun for you
 DylanGTech: I'm gonna do that now actually. Got some time
 Wontonimo: ah, the ninto challenge is all about using the right intrinsics imo
 DylanGTech: I took a math-based approach on that actually
 DylanGTech: Tried to reverse-engineer the algorithm
 Wontonimo: are you familiar with writing simulations and using search algos like minimax?
 DylanGTech: Kinda like how you can use order of operationg in algebra to isolate "x" or something
 DylanGTech: Wontonimo not quite sure in all honesty. Never used minimax, but I have used algorithms for things like sorting, traversing trees, etc
 DylanGTech: My community college CS professors assumed that we were not going for our Bachelors, so they HAMMERED into us as much as they reasonably could.
 69razer69: wontonimo
 Wontonimo: 69razer69
 BlaiseEbuth: Carrot
 69razer69: bro u r 606 in cyborg up rising
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 DylanGTech: I had 2 weeks to write a binary tree creation/traversal library in C during my 2nd semester in college lol
 Wontonimo: I'm not living up to my potential.  i hang my head low 69razer69
 DylanGTech: I think those professors pushing me hard REALLY made me the borderline expert I am today
 DylanGTech: My university that I transferred to after getting my Associate's was so lax, and I felt like I didn't learn much
 DylanGTech: I sometimes wish I had instead left with my Associate's, maybe gone to a boot camp, and started writing open source even more often to appeal to employers
 DylanGTech: Would have saved so much money that way
 69razer69: lol i am living to my potential and still my bot is shit wontonimo
 69razer69: can u enlighten me with some strategies
 Wontonimo: [channeling the sarcasm of Blaise] focus on winning
 Wontonimo: but seriously,
 69razer69: i am focusing as much as i can
 Wontonimo: I just study the replays of bots that are higher in the leaderboard than I am
 Wontonimo: and try to code their behaviour
 Wontonimo: in the process of doing that more ideas and insight come
 69razer69: how can i watch replays of higher ranked bots
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell/leaderboard</a>
 Wontonimo: every multi has a leaderboard.  from there you can click on "view last battles" for anyone on it
 Wontonimo: i'd recommend NOT reviewing the top people and instead view people at the top of your league first
 69razer69: oh yeah i can see
 69razer69: thanks
 69razer69: u just showed me how to fish
 Overbed: i  do pot racing but the screen video isnt moving
 Wontonimo: refresh
 Overbed: doesnt my code dissapear then?
 Wontonimo: copy it into your buffer if you are concerned
 Wontonimo: hey 69razer69 , I don't see your bot in cyborg uprising 
 eulerscheZahl: "i'd recommend NOT reviewing the top people"why not?
 BlaiseEbuth: Shhhh toad. Listen to Wontonimod
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Wontonimo: good question.  When someone is in Wood 2 and only has some of the options available and not the whole game, reviewing Legend bots is interesting and insighful, but not immediately useful
 eulerscheZahl: i may have missed the wood2 part
 BlaiseEbuth: See. Just listen
 eulerscheZahl: but from bronze on i see absolutely no reason not to get inspiration from the best
 Wontonimo: maybe i should have said something about that, and been more specific.  yes, I agree with you 100%
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 lakaoe: how to use count function when i want to count how many "A" there are in input
 eulerscheZahl: input().count('A')
 lakaoe: okay thx
 BlaiseEbuth: thx googleZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i take that as in insult
 eulerscheZahl: as an*
 Overbed: lol
 Uljahn: LMGTFYZahl
 BlaiseEbuth: Well... It is.
 Overbed: s = input()print(s.count("A"),+" ",s.count("C")," ",s.count("G"),+" ",s.count("T"))
 Overbed: this doesnt work
 Overbed: for 
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, you meant it the other way. somehow i thought your message was "euler had to look it up himself"
 Overbed: InputAACTOutput2 1 0 1 counting the A C G or T
 Overbed: i want to count the A, C, G or T's in input but this doesnt work
 Overbed: s = input()print(s.count("A"),+" ",s.count("C")," ",s.count("G"),+" ",s.count("T"))
 Overbed: nvm i got it to work
 Overbed: i just removed the " "
 eulerscheZahl: print(s.count("A"),s.count("C"),s.count("G"),s.count("T"))
 BlaiseEbuth: I meant you answered instead to force him to do an exhausting 2sec google search.
 Overbed:&#160;?
 Overbed: thanks btw eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: true, looking things up on your own is a valuable skill
 Overbed: i didnt look it up&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: exactly Blaise's point
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup
 Overbed: oh forcing euler
 lakaoe: what if i want to have +1 everytime it got count in input
 Overbed: just count
 Overbed: not +1
 Overbed: cz it already counts "1"
 Overbed: thats the whole function
 Overbed: print(s.count("A"),s.count("C"),s.count("G"),s.count("T"))
 Overbed: no need for +1
 lakaoe: okay thx

 Overbed: hi e_fishel
 e_fishel: hi overbed
 e_fishel: i remember you haahahahaha
 Overbed: from last evening?
 e_fishel: well
 e_fishel: last morning
 Overbed: oh
 e_fishel: because of timezones
 e_fishel: but indeed
 Overbed: not for me
 Overbed: ah
 Overbed: whats the website where you can search up the puzzle
 Overbed: again
 e_fishel: which puzzle
 Overbed: every
 e_fishel: 'the puzzle'
 e_fishel: google?
 Overbed: you type in keyword and you get the puzzler
 e_fishel: every puzzle
 Overbed: something like eulerschezalhgogle.com
 e_fishel: what does that mean
 e_fishel: euler?
 Overbed: the website he made i think
 e_fishel: i can't recall such website
 Overbed: eulerscheZahl
 Overbed: thats his name
 Overbed: idk the website
 e_fishel: neither do i
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>

 Overbed: anyone know what this is?
 Overbed: i thought it was the lowest number * (number1 + number2) but the last test fails:
 Overbed: 276891
 Overbed: 276 is 891
 Overbed: i got 198
 Overbed: OHH ITS FIXED ORDER
 Overbed: wait aht
 Overbed: what function lets you reverse a text
 Uljahn: what are you going to do when there's nobody to answer you in the chat :scream_cat:
 Overbed: absolutely something bad

 Uljahn: x * (x + y) doesn't work?
 Overbed: i mean the reversed but i almost got it wait

 Overbed: was 50%
 Overbed: but it was reverse so i dont think i can find the contribution
 Caticii: anybody doing the 2021 spring contest in js and the code isnt working properly 
 Overbed: wait
 Overbed: i overthinked so much
 lakaoe: same
 Overbed: x*(x+y) wouldve worked :joy:
 Overbed: wait 
 Overbed: maybe it wouldnt
 nitekat: the elif x &gt; y and (y*(x+y)) &gt; 200 condition will never happen

 Overbed: how to make something print out as upper but it was lower
 e_fishel: flip the case
 Overbed:&#160;?
 Dren: you need to call it
 Overbed: Hello WorldhELLO wORLD
 Dren: so add ()
 Overbed: needs to be
 Overbed: what
 e_fishel: call the method
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c0b964a-86f5-43f9-8288-02859599c89f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c0b964a-86f5-43f9-8288-02859599c89f</a>
 Dren: s.lower should be s.lower()
 Overbed: look at my code
 e_fishel: does it not work?
 Overbed: no
 Overbed: it prints out
 Overbed: "hello world"
 Dren: it doesn't iterate over the letters
 Overbed:&#160;?
 e_fishel: you need the for in
 Overbed:&#160;?
 e_fishel: for s in input()
 e_fishel: doesn't print() generate a new line every t ime?
 e_fishel: time*
 Dren: yes
 e_fishel: so...
 Dren: but you can specify end keyword argument
 Dren: print(text, end=<i>)</i>
 e_fishel: alright
 Overbed:&#160;????????????
 Dren: so it replaces the default '\n'
 Dren: that it adds at the end of every print
 e_fishel: that is rather convenient
 Overbed: so what do i put in de code
 Dren: you can also just do print(end=character)
 e_fishel: so that prints nothing
 e_fishel: and ends iht with character
 Overbed: i dont get it
 e_fishel: so it prints character
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/714a04be-5d54-4e46-a009-95a33d1a3a27">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/714a04be-5d54-4e46-a009-95a33d1a3a27</a>
 Overbed: how to make this code
 e_fishel: to make that code what
 Dren: yes print(end=character) is the same as print(character, end=<i>)</i>
 Overbed: make uppercase letters turn into lowercase
 Dren: just shorter
 lakaoe: and lowercase into uppercase
 e_fishel: s = input()
 Dren: map over the string 
 e_fishel: for i in s:
 Dren: map(transform, string)
 eulerscheZahl: is the input only letters or also spaces, digits, ...?
 Dren: where transform is a function you make
 e_fishel:   if i.isupper:
 e_fishel: i guess
 Overbed: eulerscheZahl $ABCDEF g12 is an input so i am assuming
 e_fishel: i guess you could also use a ternary operator inside print
 Overbed: they are spaces and digits and numbers and stuff
 eulerscheZahl: evil input, can't just xor every letter with 0x20
 Overbed: e_fishel that code doesnt work
 Overbed: it just prints out hello world
 Dren: because you look at the whole string
 Dren: their code is supposed to evaluate on a character basis
 lakaoe: you have to make uppercase and lowercase the opposite in the same input
 e_fishel: \/shrug
 Overbed: sorry i dont get what you are saying
 Dren: your code does this 
 Overbed: do i use a for loop?
 e_fishel: s = input()
 e_fishel: for i in s:
 e_fishel:   if i.isupper:
 e_fishel: does that work?
 Dren: you are not supposed to give whole solutions fishel
 Overbed: i cant even finish it cz the clash of code (btw its private) just expired
 Overbed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bc589605-5aca-4e28-8c3a-2e7fe8a4dcd4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bc589605-5aca-4e28-8c3a-2e7fe8a4dcd4</a>
 Overbed: doesnt wrok
 Dren: because range(text) is not a thing
 e_fishel: it's not range(hs)
 Overbed: what range then
 e_fishel: it's simply s
 Dren: for i in text:
 e_fishel: not a range at all
 Dren: returns t
 Dren: e
 Dren: x
 Dren: t
 Overbed: would range return nothing?
 e_fishel: range returns all the numbers from 0 to N-1
 Dren: range is like a list of increasing numbers
 e_fishel: this isn't about numbers
 Overbed: ohhh
 e_fishel: range is like the iota function
 e_fishel: std::iota
 Dren: except it's a generator
 e_fishel: yeah
 e_fishel: iota is an array
 Dren: so it is more efficient with large data
 Wontonimo: range(10000000) works
 Wontonimo: and doesn't use more than a few bytes of memory
 Overbed: would that do: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cdbc3cc0-cdda-4582-a480-7aa1cdee3d89">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cdbc3cc0-cdda-4582-a480-7aa1cdee3d89</a>
 Wontonimo: list(range(10000000)) doesn't work
 e_fishel: it would do
 e_fishel: 0
 e_fishel: 1
 Overbed: ohh
 e_fishel: 2
 Wontonimo: for x in range(100000):
 e_fishel: 3Ω…
 Wontonimo: range(100000) doesn't really do anything
 e_fishel: itself
 Wontonimo: you've gotta call 'next' on it to get the next value.  the 'for x in some_generator_here:'  does that automatically
 Wontonimo: you can make your own generator like so
 Wontonimo: def so_much_hello():
 e_fishel: is there no * anywhere?
 Wontonimo: for x in so_much_hello():
 Wontonimo: will print hello forever
 e_fishel: js uses function* foo(){//generator function}
 e_fishel: with the asterisk
 LuisAFK: u can do generators in js?
 e_fishel: ofc
 e_fishel: indeed
 e_fishel: es6
 LuisAFK: oof
 LuisAFK: can u give example pls
 LuisAFK: i never seen
 e_fishel: alright
 Wontonimo: back in-the-day you'd roll your own generator class, where each object kept track of its internal state and exposed a public 'next'.  Under the hood, this is basically what is happening in modern generator functions except that it is shorthand now and supported as first class elements

 Overbed: for example172.16.0.0/16 would be 16
 e_fishel: in js i'd do
 e_fishel: .split('/')[1]
 Overbed: swapcase is a thing?
 e_fishel: LOL
 e_fishel: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 camnwalter: test
 Overbed: bruh i spent like 13 minutes trying to find

 Wontonimo: e_fishel - you can share runnable code segments on tech.io .  Here is your code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/cVvH7vg">https://tech.io/snippet/cVvH7vg</a>
 e_fishel: wow :O
 e_fishel: thank you
 Wontonimo: ^^ it's the same runtime as codingame so it will work in multis and practice here 
 e_fishel: :DDDD
 Wontonimo: (it is literally the same servers)
 e_fishel: awesome
 e_fishel: i'll check it out next time
 Wontonimo: you can even make it interactive so people can run your code, it asks for user input, and responds.  Here is a sample adventure game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR">https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR</a>
 Wontonimo: hmm ... it times out a lot faster now than it did a month ago&#160;:(  not really enough time to play my adventure game
 e_fishel: :pensive:
 e_fishel: woah
 e_fishel: woah woah
 e_fishel: it has markdown emojis
 e_fishel: :zany_face:
 e_fishel: :zany:
 Wontonimo: only some
 e_fishel: gosh darn
 e_fishel: :pensive:
 e_fishel: pensive
 Wontonimo: :gosh_darn_face:
 e_fishel: lol
 Wontonimo: I successfully trolled MSmits once and said that you have to press command-Q to reload the markdown if it isn't showing properly LOL
 Kailynn: Hey
 Wontonimo: he fell for it
 e_fishel: :sunglasses:
 e_fishel: :wink:
 e_fishel: :trollface:
 e_fishel: aw man
 e_fishel: :100:
 Wontonimo: alright, enough of this side chat.  lets get back to coding
 e_fishel: indeed
 e_fishel: literal side chat
 Wontonimo: hi Kailynn, welcome to codingame
 Wontonimo: there is more to this site than just clash of code.  Check out the puzzles (no timers!) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a> and the bot battles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 e_fishel: i got into clash of code because of a yt video
 e_fishel: a swiss youtuber was playing it
 jacek: codingame? you mean clash of code site?
 camnwalter: hell o world
 DHenricks: hi world
 DHenricks: :rage:
 camnwalter: :money_mouth:
 camnwalter: @DHenricks a
 camnwalter: where is alecman
 camnwalter: i need alecman to save me
 camnwalter: ruby god
 e_fishel: alecman the computer
 camnwalter: hi @BitWolf
 jacek: and his greatest enemy, the sapphire
 AlecMan: hey dude
 AlecMan: ha
 camnwalter: NO WAY
 e_fishel: LOL
 blokman: aaaaaaaaaa
 e_fishel: oh my gosh
 e_fishel: i'm gonna have to solve this puzzle with O(n^3)
 e_fishel:&#160;;-;
 jay3332: you aare
 e_fishel: the good thing is that, based on the limits, it'll iterate 52000 times
 e_fishel: (worst case)
 eulerscheZahl: camnwalter BitWolf won't answer you. that's a bot
 Wontonimo: oh no euler, don't reveal the big secret that most people on Clash are bots&#160;!
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Uljahn: most people on the chat are Automaton2000 copies :scream_cat:
 Automaton2000: i am now in gold
 camnwalter: oh sad
 camnwalter: didnt read its bio
 Wontonimo: the "modern multiplayer" is usually just single player vs bots.
 Wontonimo: everyone wants multiplayer, but with so many games available there is a serious lack of other players ... what is a game developer supposed to do?
 Husoski: go back to pvm where the whole thing started
 blokman: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Wontonimo: first warning blokman, no spamming
 Husoski: West of HouseYou are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.There is a small mailbox here.
 Flowerbear: when people don't share COC code:
 BitWolfStan: it is I, Bit Wolf Stan
 Comder: Congramts
 Wontonimo: oh Husoski, that's Zork 1
 Wontonimo: Zork was the first computer game I ever played (that wasn't a vic20 or atari)
 Husoski: I had it on my Kaypro and Atari computers.
 blokman: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Husoski: I don't think b-l-o-k-m-a-n groks text adventures...
 BlaiseEbuth: Remind me Inform
 JariMikkonen: wö
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://inform7.com/">http://inform7.com/</a>
 Wontonimo: here is a great writeup for those interested in how zork worked <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/swlh/zork-the-great-inner-workings-b68012952bdc">https://medium.com/swlh/zork-the-great-inner-workings-b68012952bdc</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you know Ord.&#160;? That's a recent game that takes back the textual adventure concept in an ultra minimalist way. And you can create your own scenari and share them.
 Wontonimo: no, link plz&#160;!

 BlaiseEbuth: Yup
 Husoski: I know something of the inner workings from decompiling Trinity...I had a disassembler for the Z-machine, too.
 BlaiseEbuth: And in a less serious (but more related to AI) way, there's <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home">https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home</a>
 Husoski: I wonder if that Z-machine was what inspired Gosling to make a VM for Java?
 Husoski: Infocom had "write once run everywhere" over a decade before Java.
 Husoski: (Almost everywhere.  I suspect that Wontonimo's VIC-20 was too small...you could only put about 20KB of RAM on those.)
 Wontonimo: I've tried AI dungeon.  It does not have object permanence or spacial reasoning.  A window can be far underground that leads to a backyard.  Or a rhino can be in a shoebox
 BlaiseEbuth: And a decade wasn't enough to discourage java creator to commit it, or people to use java...&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah Wontonimo, that's why I said "in a less serious way"
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 Westicles: Infocom... that reminds me, I never did solve Bureaucracy
 Husoski: That was fun!  Random Q. Hacker was the villain!
 BlaiseEbuth: French people try to solve bureaucracy for 50 years... :p
 Husoski: Hahaha.  
 Wontonimo: oh but it is fun to play with BlaiseEbuth.  You can solve games by giving hints in your answers to guide the story in weird ways
 Westicles: the noisome stew kept killing me
 NotANick: I learned new shortest trick for php: I learned we dont need php tag actually so we can use &lt;?&#160;?&gt; instead of &lt;?php&#160;?&gt;
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtEkUmYecnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtEkUmYecnk</a>
 Wontonimo: there was a dragon quest and I kept describing the dragon as "friendly and small as a kitten" and it just became my friend
 Husoski: Wasn't noisome stew in Lurking Horror?
 BlaiseEbuth: Exactly Jacek ^^
 Westicles: Maybe... it was on one of the airplane tables in Bureaucracy.  I can't believe I remember that 35 years later
 Husoski: Okay.  I remember the computer was a Boysenberry...
 Husoski: bye all; got things to see and people to do...
 BlaiseEbuth: :wave:
 coderlady: Hi there , any recent Java J2EE
 Westicles: NotANick, try this:
 Westicles: &lt;?=`bash code here`;
 NotANick: its echo i readed that
 NotANick: thanks regardless
 SpaceMan0009: Hi all,
 SpaceMan0009: I'm looking  for a java developer full remotedid someone have some opportunities?
 Overbed: i dont get the mad pod racing how do i change the thrust
 Westicles: Wontonimo is not here right now, please leave a message at the tone
 jacek: nor madknight?
 e_fishel: isn't it great that everyone's nationalities are displayed?
 e_fishel: in some cases, even the city
 Westicles: Yep!  Come visit me if you are in town
 e_fishel: no cap?
 e_fishel: for real?
 Overbed: if next_checkpoint_dist == 50:
 Overbed: why how
 jacek: you need to print x y thrust/boost always
 Overbed:&#160;???
 Overbed: print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, thrust)
 jacek: print prints next line
 Overbed: then what do i do
 5DN1L: You need to print everything including BOOST in the same line
 jacek: try print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, thrust, end="")
 Overbed: i want boost in it
 jacek: also, when you want to boost, you need to print it instead of thrust
 Overbed: i dont get it
 Westicles: Ah, the Netherlands.  Do you know Paul Cooijmans?
 5DN1L: Overbed, when you don't need boost, print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, thrust)
 5DN1L: When you need boost, When you don't need boost, print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, "BOOST")
 5DN1L: oops
 5DN1L: When you need boost, print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, "BOOST")
 Overbed: i dont know paul coojimans
 Overbed: 5DN1L yes i get that part
 5DN1L: :clap:
 Overbed: can i use if function for this?
 5DN1L: sure
 Overbed: if next_checkpoint_dist &lt; 60:
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Overbed: it still doesnt boost
 Overbed: if next_checkpoint_dist &lt; 60 and next_checkpoint_dist &gt; 50:
 Overbed: 
 jacek: whats next_checkpoint_dist
 Westicles: there is a channel for racing questions #fr
 Overbed: next_checkpoint_dist is the distance to the next checkpoint
 magicKULA: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/2112470e5a998134200f40d0329fec8347da8a8">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/2112470e5a998134200f40d0329fec8347da8a8</a>
 Leoduyanh: joe bieden
 Leoduyanh: joe dbidne
 Leoduyanh: joe binden
 Wontonimo: the distance to the next checkpoint will be &gt; 600 because the checkpoints are 600 units in radius
 Wontonimo: and the distance is to their center Overbed
 Wontonimo: also Overbed, you only get 1 boost in the lower levels, so once you use it trying to use it again just is interpreted as to thrust = 100
 struct: we need fuel based csb
 Wontonimo: let's make it.  in addition, let's make it such that the ONLY controls are to define weights and input to an NN
 makerecho: what's up with the bot galore recently XD
 jacek: hm?
 Velcoro: bots in CoC join, when there's less than 4 players
 struct: then i would have to code a NN Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: yeah!  let's do it!
 ZarthaxX: hello
 jacek: oh struct, now theres at least 1 nn in 9mm
 makerecho: i thougnt only 1 or 2 join, not 5 :D
 Wontonimo: hey ZarthaxX, long time (maybe, i have a small memory)
 ZarthaxX: no, you are right lol
 ZarthaxX: havent been here for weeks
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 struct: you have a NN there now?
 jacek: you can tell from the points :v
 Wontonimo: lol, the point spread is funny
 Wontonimo: did you use AZ&#160;?
 jacek: somewhat. but i train only value, not policy
 Wontonimo: MCTS + NN value 
 jacek: yes
 Wontonimo: how many expansions of the tree are you making per frame?
 jacek: you mean rollouts per turn?
 Wontonimo: yes, but you arn't actually rollout out, you are using the NN eval
 struct: how many expanded nodes I guess
 jacek: about 4k iterations per 40ms. iteration meaning selection, expansion, evals and backprop
 struct: selection should be cheap right?
 struct: in comparison with the eval
 jacek: yes
 jacek: in 40ms, 26k nodes are made
 jacek: i had bad results in the beginning until i made inputs a game phase based
 struct: ah so you dont expand and eval all?
 Wontonimo: during training, do you rotate the learnings so that your NN learns the board symmetrically&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: struct i expand every children with eval
 struct: so eval then expand that child
 struct: not expand then eval all childs created
 jacek: hmm
 struct: it should be the 1st one
 jacek: select -&gt; isLeaf? expand all its children with evals. backprop
 struct: o.o
 struct: so you eval all childs created during expansion
 jacek: thats why 4k iterations but 26k nodes, considering average branching factor of about 6
 jacek: yes, otherwise how would i know which child to choose, if i dont have policy?
 struct: but shouldnt the number of evals be = to the number of nodes?
 jacek: there is
 struct: so  4k = the number of backprops?
 struct: I see
 jacek: yes
 struct: it all makes sense now
 Wontonimo: :mind-not-blown:
 Wontonimo: :understanding-mind:
 Wontonimo: actually, that's really cool Jacek&#160;!  My mind is blown that such a technique just lays waste to alternative approaches
 Wontonimo: when the game is so small
 Wontonimo: it seems like brute force would do well
 jacek: i wonder if smits will solve it withing cg constraints
 struct: he needs to solve amazons first
 struct: I need to find a game to port
 jacek: wondev womans?
 struct: no, the real amazons
 jacek: gonna sleeps eh

 C26_1: Oh hello
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: This is the night
 C26_1: I shouldn't disturb anyone here
 C26_1: Ok bye bye
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 BartholomewIII: it's 5 pm here
 C26_1: Oh
 UZUHAMA: it's 4 pm here
 C26_1: So it's not too late
 UZUHAMA: yee
 C26_1: Can I talk about my puzzle
 BartholomewIII: besides, there's no notifs to wake people or anything
 UZUHAMA: But the sun's already setting
 BartholomewIII: sure
 C26_1: Ok
 C26_1: My puzzle name: Covid-19 Spreading Model
 C26_1: Example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06c23d2f-5991-4a7e-b542-5f7ac13a69f5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06c23d2f-5991-4a7e-b542-5f7ac13a69f5</a>
 C26_1: The first number is the width of the crowd, the second one is the height, the third one is how strong the virus is, and the fourth is the crowd itself
 C26_1: Each people in the crowd has a number, representing the HP that they have left.
 C26_1: 0 is a special number that represent infected people
 C26_1: We gonna run step-by-step method apply at the crowd 
 BartholomewIII: k
 C26_1: Although I can't explain the method properly
 C26_1: I 'm gonna show it on an example mentioned above
 C26_1: There are 5 rules here:
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2f40a3fa-dd19-496e-b670-d5f391b23f18">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2f40a3fa-dd19-496e-b670-d5f391b23f18</a>
 C26_1: And I'm gonna using the kind of coordinate where the left most cell has coordinate (1,1)
 C26_1: Example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5c897864-f130-4023-8319-0d2d3f20c19d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5c897864-f130-4023-8319-0d2d3f20c19d</a>
 C26_1: Step 1: Cell (4,3) infect Cell (4,2) and Cell (3,3)
 C26_1: Now the crowd looks like this
 C26_1: 3 4 5 21 3 4 29 6 0 0
 BartholomewIII: I think I get it
 C26_1: I should say that if somehow there's a person who has HP lower than 0, then it'll automatically denoted as 0 at any step
 C26_1: No one gets cured
 C26_1: Step 2: Cell (4,3) infect Cell (4,2). Cell (3,3) infect Cell (3,2) and Cell (2,3)
 C26_1: Now it looks like this:3 4 5 21 3 0 09 1 0 0
 C26_1: Step 3: Cell (3,3) infect Cell (2,3). Cell (3,2) infect Cell (2,2) and Cell (3,1). Cell (4,2) infect Cell (4,1)
 C26_1: Now it looks like this:3 4 0 01 0 0 09 0 0 0
 C26_1: Step 3: Cell (3,1) infect Cell (2,1). Cell (2,2) infect Cell (2,1). Cell (2,3) infect Cell 1,3)3 4 0 01 0 0 09 0 0 0
 C26_1: Now it looks like this:3 0 0 00 0 0 09 0 0 0
 C26_1: So in total, we gonna need 5 step that all people will be infected
 C26_1: Goal of the puzzle: Find the total step of a crowd
 C26_1: 3 4 0 210 0 2 10 12 4 3
 C26_1: Actually
 C26_1: Cell (1,2) is been infected two times at the same step
 C26_1: So it gains 10 ATK\
 C26_1: Not 5 anymore
 C26_1: So we subtract the health by the ATK of the virus 
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: Are you understand?
 C26_1: Anyone here?
 C26_1: Hello?
 C26_1: Hello!!
 BartholomewIII: Yeah, I get it. Do you have any questions for me about it?
 BartholomewIII: It seems like you got a handle on it.

 visva: u a mod?
 struct: yes
 visva: do u know java
 Ocean_Arbeit: how do you print list number
 struct: which language Ocean_Arbeit?
 visva: java
 Ocean_Arbeit: python 3
 struct: visva only a bit
 visva: print(something)
 visva: ez
 Ocean_Arbeit: like i know how to print a certain element but how do you print what number of the list something is in
 struct: print(' '.join(list))
 struct: number of the list?
 struct: can you provide an example?
 Ocean_Arbeit: like if I want to print what index
 Ocean_Arbeit: a certain number is on
 visva: print(arr[i]0
 visva: :grin:
 struct: list.index(n);
 Ocean_Arbeit: like if I try to find 5 in [1,2,4,5,2,3] then I print 3
 Ocean_Arbeit: ill try that
 Ocean_Arbeit: that worked but i still stuck
 visva: do u use replit to code?
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: I use vs
 ZXC01: hi
 Thorcode: hi
 PoPoPosPos: :blush:
 ZXC01: hi can anyone help me with great escape?
 Ocean_Arbeit: is there a way to use list.index(_) on a integer
 ZXC01: hmm change the int to a str I guess
 struct: list.index(integer) works?
 struct: or is the list not ints?
 Ocean_Arbeit: ohh i changed something for testing that made it not an int
 Ocean_Arbeit: thanks
 Thorcode: ['--.', '--.', '--', '--.', '....']--.-------..
 Thorcode: can someone explain this for me?
 Thorcode: I almost finish all I think
 struct: what is there to explain?
 Thorcode: why this testcase have 2 output?
 struct: it only has 1 output
 Thorcode: nah 2
 struct: ...
 Thorcode: it is the third testcase
 Thorcode: ah yeah only one but output 2
 Thorcode: the ouput is 2
 struct: because 2 messages can be created
 Ocean_Arbeit: I'm doing the temperature one and all of them are good except for no temperature and only negatives
 ZXC01: lol i got bit of problem on that too
 Ocean_Arbeit: because the list is out of range
 ZXC01: i ot only 93 percent
 Thorcode: how can 2 message could be create in that
 struct: HELL and HELLo
 struct: HELLO*
 Thorcode: ah
 struct: you dont need to use all the dots
 Thorcode: I understanded
 Thorcode: thanks alot struct
 Thorcode: understood
 Ocean_Arbeit: how to see how many elements in a list
 ZXC01: len(list)
 Ocean_Arbeit: ok thanks
 ZXC01: can anyone help me with great escape?
 Wontonimo: what have you tried so far?
 ZXC01: tried?
 ZXC01: game or code?
 Thorcode: he's on bronze haha
 ZXC01: ...
 Wontonimo: for great escape
 Wontonimo: to get ahead
 Thorcode: yep
 ZXC01: hmm
 ZXC01: i tried some code but all didnt work
 ZXC01: so i delete them
 Wontonimo: i'm looking at your replays and you don't even go to the opposite side
 Wontonimo: do that
 ZXC01: i mean that was when i use a hard code
 ZXC01: where i just built wall for enemy to die
 Wontonimo: okay, so now try
 ZXC01: .
 Wontonimo: have you looked at replays of other better bots <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/great-escape/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=bronze">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/great-escape/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=bronze</a>
 ZXC01: yeah
 Wontonimo: honestly, looking at the top bots, it looks like just moving straight to the other side is a winning strategy for bronze
 Thorcode: bruh just make block to win?
 struct: why dont you do it?
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: I could not block all of the map
 Thorcode: why
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3fe51dc-7db7-4143-82fe-299b5bb1fce1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3fe51dc-7db7-4143-82fe-299b5bb1fce1</a>
 Thorcode: is this code is noobiest for tem?
 Thorcode: than almost anyone could do that?
 Ocean_Arbeit: how do i print debug
 Wontonimo: print("debug")
 struct: print("message", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Wontonimo: no, that prints "message" to stderr
 Wontonimo: he wants to print "debug"
 struct: he just skips words
 Ocean_Arbeit: how do i log thors x and y
 Ocean_Arbeit: on power of thor 1
 ZXC01: log?
 Ocean_Arbeit: in a variable
 ZXC01: hmm istn that already x and y?
 Ocean_Arbeit: it has the initial
 ZXC01: idk then
 ZXC01: but do you really need it?
 TheUmgawa: Wait, are we trying to get Thor's current location? Because there's no handle for it. You have to compute it as you go.
 Thorcode: wait whhat
 Thorcode: what are you guy talking about
 TheUmgawa: Sorry, I just noticed that I'm twenty minutes late on that.
 ZXC01: lol
 Thorcode: ah about the meo meo power
 Thorcode: you don't need thor current much
 ZXC01: i will give you a time machine &lt;------]
 ZXC01: more likely a gun
 TheUmgawa: Well, you can do it one of two ways, where you can either calculate the path initially, or you can calculate the path from current position at any given point. So, I figured that's why the guy wanted it.
 RickyPicky: .
 RickyPicky: dis thing is confusing
 UZUHAMA: You'll get better at it
 RickyPicky: not at all
 RickyPicky: kaboom.js is easy
 RickyPicky: but then i tried javascript
 RickyPicky: pain
 UZUHAMA: Coding = P A I N
 RickyPicky: absolutley

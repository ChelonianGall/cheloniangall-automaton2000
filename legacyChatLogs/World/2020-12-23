 Nukelets: yikes
 mzbear: as a test, i reversed the win condition in my AI ... and now it's winning every time
 mzbear: so, somehow, my MCTS is trying to deliberately lose
 Emmaplayz: hi
 Emmaplayz: what does anyone think of covid 19
 mzbear: can't figure out why my MCTS is inverted.  i'll just leave it as-is and throw into the arena, i wanna see my rank before i look into fixing it
 mzbear: right now, the code says i'm trying to deliberately lose, but that makes the bot win a lot
 mzbear: this makes bear sad
 BlackBasher2.0: hi
 BlackBasher2.0: i dont understand anything
 IfIHadATail: what do you mean?
 BlackBasher2.0: im dumb
 mzbear: and i'm about to fall asleep.  it's 8am here and i've been up all night trying to make MCTS and then i implemented it backwards somehow :D
 <b>**BlackBasher2.0 slaps  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/52739542369007" /> mzbear: and the moment i close my eyes to go sleep, i realize where my bug is
 mzbear: part of my code uses one variable to mark which player played a turn .. another part uses the same variable to determine which player's turn it is.  of course it's getting inverted
 IfIHadATail: that's when it happens when you aren't staring at the problem :P
 IfIHadATail: a lot of mine comes when I am driving home lol
 mzbear: ohwell, rank 24 in Bandas
 mzbear: could be better, could be worse
 IfIHadATail: always&#160;: )

 ChampionCoder: Can you guys please give your feedback?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59618383081e90c82220a9a230f506375266">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59618383081e90c82220a9a230f506375266</a>
 YodaMaster123: Lots of spam at this time...
 Q12: ChampionCoder I think this is too easy.
 ChampionCoder: ok thanks
 ChampionCoder: Any suggestions as to how to make it harder?
 Q12: maybe printing the word once in reverse and once in normal form, once reverse and once in normal form etc..
 ChampionCoder: ah...
 ChampionCoder: Yeah I<i>ll try that</i>
 ChampionCoder: Not sure if I can do that though, not much time on my hands
 ChampionCoder: Unfortunately :9
 ChampionCoder: *:(
 AntiSquid: i think the challenge is the poor wording / description
 AntiSquid: fix wording, add another condition / rule and should be ok
 Q12: @ChampionCoder I edit the code to what I suggested and left your code commented.

 Illedan: Didn't work
 eulerscheZahl: that worked
 Astrobytes: :D

 geppoz: let's see if someone can give me a JS hint:
 geppoz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1f9f6570-b93a-480e-85e5-a36ab9d95dee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1f9f6570-b93a-480e-85e5-a36ab9d95dee</a>
 geppoz: this doesn't work as expected
 geppoz: since the scope of var is maintained for all calls
 geppoz: I know the solution using "let" in new versions of JS
 geppoz: question: how to do it in old JS versions without "let"&#160;?
 struct: you are increasing delay by 100 every loop?
 geppoz: no, I want to call every 100ms
 struct: so at end should be 100 not delay
 geppoz: the desiderata is to have the function called every 100ms, with an increasing value
 geppoz: insted this is called every 100ms, but all with the same last value
 geppoz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe0d5443-c33d-4d4c-bd89-9916b0e8b759">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe0d5443-c33d-4d4c-bd89-9916b0e8b759</a>
 geppoz: this is the working one
 geppoz: the question is if it possibile to solve in old JS without "let"
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e5ff966-eac5-4072-a2d8-50b8eb7a6a4f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e5ff966-eac5-4072-a2d8-50b8eb7a6a4f</a>
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval">https://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval</a>
 struct: the 2nd delay inside timeout is the first parameter you pass to the pippo functon
 struct: Was this it geppoz?
 Counterbalance: alt approach 1: setTimeout(pippo.bind(null, delay), delay);
 Counterbalance: alt approach 2:setTimeout(foo(delay), delay);...function foo(d) { return function() { pippo(d) } }
 MSmits: food? Did you write this for code a la mode Counterbalance?
 Counterbalance: hm i don't think i even used the term food in that code
 jrke: MS i saw your D&amp;B bot just .01 points above me at the moment
 MSmits: hehe yeah
 MSmits: btw jrke I do random moves till endgame, then only heuristics in endgame. Nothing fancy in there yet
 MSmits: no search
 jrke: mine is just minimax with reverting last 2-3 moves of chain if chain exist
 jrke: though again random till endgame cause no eval for early game
 MSmits: do you take into account loops?
 MSmits: you can give away 4 boxes to keep control when you're finishing a loop
 MSmits: or at least a closed chain, which is what a loop becomes when it's played
 MSmits: like a 2x2 square. If someone plays it, you can put a line in such a way that you take no boxes and then it's his turn again
 jrke: i have something like play a point and check if its affected boxes are covered from 3 then play its fourth side and doing samething till the affected boxes are covered from 3 sides
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: let me look at a game see if i can find an example
 MSmits: here:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/517754550">https://www.codingame.com/replay/517754550</a>
 MSmits: your bot failed at frame 98
 MSmits: actually hmm
 struct: Has the UI been updated for it? I dont recall it being like this
 MSmits: no it didnt fail sry, jrke, you played that one right
 geppoz: ty struct and Counterbalance
 Counterbalance: yw.. there's 1 more approach tyo scope vars, called 'IFFE':     (function() { whatever} )()
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/517754198">https://www.codingame.com/replay/517754198</a> frame 58 jrke, i offer you boxes, but you dont take them, why not?
 MSmits: singular opened boxes should always be taken otherwise the opponent will
 MSmits: it's a guaranteed superior move
 jrke: well i have to debug that move
 MSmits: it's better to not even search in that case
 MSmits: if you see an open move that is a chain of 1 box, always take it
 MSmits: i mean a single box with 3 sides filled
 MSmits: if it's a chain of 2 it's different
 MSmits: same game, frame 91, another mistake
 MSmits: you take all boxes
 MSmits: you should have played B6 left, give me those 4 boxes, then take entire last chain
 struct: So I was reading about process and pipes for c++, so when im writing to process I must close the pipe before I read right?
 MSmits: now you got 4 boxes and i got the big chain
 MSmits: oh damnit, i got it wrong again, i actually played B6 left and gave you the 4, not your fault. this game is complicated&#160;:(
 jrke: i will say this game is not just about endgames 
 jacek: its about fun, as with all games
 AntiSquid: all about the happy end games, right Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you mean it is a good idea to make it a bit more complicated
 jrke: well my last submitted bot performs well against you MS
 jrke: nieren is just defeating me else i would be at 2nd pos atm
 RustySuperstar_8e15: ¤
 draconis19: Astrobytes u here?
 MSmits: jrke you're right it's not, but there's only one bot on the leaderboard that does anything good with the first half of the game
 MSmits: all the other bots might as well play randomly
 MSmits: because that is what i do and i do just as well as the others
 MSmits: the trick to beating crazy remi is in that first half
 MSmits: you'll notice from his games he is giving away  a lot of boxes, seemingly randomly, but there is a purpose to that. It's to give him control in the endgame
 draconis19: Astrobytes chat here if youre here!
 jrke: i have noticed a unusual behaviour in my bot it doesn't takes border single paired boxes in early games
 MSmits: paired?
 MSmits: do you mean 2 boxes you can take with 1 line?
 jrke: single i mean
 MSmits: oh
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517755383">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517755383</a> here is also an example
 MSmits: yea your bot doesnt always take them late game either
 MSmits: yes, always take them
 MSmits: there might be benefit in offering someone a box, but if someone offers you a box, always take it
 MSmits: otherwise he;s just gonna take it himself on the next turn and you'll have the same boardstate but your score will be 2 worse
 jrke: yeah
 MSmits: the reason he offers those boxes, is to affect what the chain structure looks like in the late game
 MSmits: you can afford to be like 10 points behind, if you're gonna get most of the 39 other boxes
 MSmits: I'm just not sure if he's not giving them away unnecessarily. He gives away *a lot* of them
 MSmits: obviously he always wins, but thats because we're all flailing in the dark up to ply 50. Easy pickins
 jrke: yes
 Or64bit: Could someone please help me with some c++ syntax
 MSmits: if someone else builds a bot with a brain in those first 50 plies, he could lose a lot
 Or64bit: I spent my last 2 hours googling and I can't seem to get an answer
 MSmits: depends on how hard it is
 MSmits: not  likely i can help, but try me
 jacek: i wonder what those number mean
 MSmits: which numbers jacek?
 jacek: remi's "eval"
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: let me check it out
 struct: Ask the question, if someone knows they will answer
 MSmits: drops from 0.08 to nearly 0 in the end game
 MSmits: he makes really neat easily solvable endgames too
 MSmits: pretty sure he's counting chains
 Or64bit: I have a class that uses a template like so: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8646cf17-72d1-45eb-8dca-e342c283b414">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8646cf17-72d1-45eb-8dca-e342c283b414</a>
 MSmits: nope sry, never use templates
 MSmits: but someone else will know
 Or64bit: I kinda messed up the naming there also it should be MyClass&lt;L&gt;::MyClass() before this last row
 Or64bit: But only when typing it out here the code is fine and clion does not show any error or warning for it
 jrke: gtg gn bye
 Counterbalance: struct: before the fork you set up 3 pipes; after the fork, in the parent, you close the sides of the pipes you don't use (i.e. reading from the piped stdin, writing to stdout/stderr). In the child process, you dup2 all file pipe handles that you use and then close all the pipe file handles
 struct: Thanks Counterbalance Ill try again, there is not much stuff I can find about it, at least for windows
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e9fa1096-8937-4a00-a106-1f1d6f91dd30">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e9fa1096-8937-4a00-a106-1f1d6f91dd30</a>
 Counterbalance: ohh windows
 struct: Or64bit you get no error right?
 Counterbalance: that works entirely differently
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c24a718-4ffd-459d-a7bc-30525bf18b38">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c24a718-4ffd-459d-a7bc-30525bf18b38</a>
 struct: Ill try to search a bit more about it
 Counterbalance: Or64bit you're defining (not just declaring) the constructor in the header file aswell, right, not in a .cpp file?
 Or64bit: in the header file I only have a line like so: MyClass&lt;type&gt;(); inside the class
 Or64bit: which is different from struct 's code since he leaves out the generic part but neither of those seems to work for me
 Counterbalance: do you need the constructor?
 Counterbalance: if so, you need to implement it in the header
 Or64bit: I'll try that
 Or64bit: This way I don't get an error for the constructor but it still throws an undefined reference for every other function in the cpp file that I have in the header file
 Counterbalance: templates are header-only
 Counterbalance: So you need to put all the implementation in the header file aswell
 Counterbalance: When you 'instantiate' the class, with a parameter for L, the compiler needs to already have read all the code for that template class. It cannot be in .cpp files.
 Or64bit: I'm trying to make a generic linked list and I thought that it would be nice to split it up into a header file and a cpp file 
 Counterbalance: yeah that would be nice, unfortunately that doesn't work for template classes.. 
 Counterbalance: the compiler cannot compile that cpp file because it has no idea what L is
 Or64bit: I tried moving the whole class with functions inside it into a cpp file and ran it and it compiled and did it what it's supposed to 
 Or64bit: Is the template thing only a problem when it was declared in a header filed first?
 Counterbalance: No, not really. That cpp file with the implementation would have produced either no code, or code for a specific instance, where you specified a value for L.
 Counterbalance: What did you mean by 'did what it's supposed to'?
 Or64bit: For simplicity sake I searched for a tutorial online and just threw the code into a cpp file and then included it in my main cpp and ran it
 Or64bit: here is the code: 
 Or64bit: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codespeedy.com/write-a-cpp-program-to-demonstrate-generic-linked-list/">https://www.codespeedy.com/write-a-cpp-program-to-demonstrate-generic-linked-list/</a>
 Or64bit: I don't really see it giving a specific instance to L so for that reason I don't quite understand your last comment
 Or64bit: unless if giving a specific instance means the LinkedList&lt;int&gt; part but I don't think that's what you meant
 Counterbalance: yes that's what I meant
 draconis19: go to the #clash channel if youre looking for clashes to join!
 Or64bit: Ohh I see
 jacek: oO
 Or64bit: But won't I have to do that every time I create an instance of the class?
 Counterbalance: if you put all the code above main() into a header file you're done. 
 Or64bit: seems fair enough
 Or64bit: thanks for your help and patience it is much appreciated
 Counterbalance: You're welcome. It's a tricky subject&#160;:)
 Or64bit: I'm sure about that now&#160;:)
 draconis19: if you want to join some clashes, go to #clash!
 jacek: where should i got if i dont want to join any clashes

 Cappefra: or to be drunk
 VizGhar: :D heh, I was most awesome sudoku solver under right amount of booze

 VizGhar: :D :D :D
 Cappefra: but also many times even after one beer I feel sooo lazy
 Astrobytes: Those are the times you should just chill out and step away from the keyboard&#160;;)
 VizGhar: 1 is not enough... beer (alcohol) has that effect of "brilliant ideas" and cofee has effect of "being able to work indeffinitely"
 VizGhar: however Im allergic to cofee and don't drink :D
 Astrobytes: I try to limit my intake
 struct: I only drink it during contests
 Cappefra: Right! I guess after a couple beers I might be more "elastic" or creative and end  up coding better but 1. only if it doesn't require careful maths cause yeah no I'm definitely not better at maths drunk and 2. I feel like I wanna give my brain a break and just read reddit or something
 struct: Had an exam during an hangover, did not go great
 struct: Math

 TheIceMaster_945d: Hi 
 Cappefra: I'm pretty sure I spelled it with lower case g
 Astrobytes: think it works either way
 Astrobytes: don't quote me on that though
 Astrobytes: You're still cutting-edge jacek, they haven't caught up with you just yet
 struct: ok I give up on trying this pipe stuff
 mzbear: what's the problem with pipes?
 struct: I cant seem to find a way to write to another program cin
 struct: using c++
 mzbear: which platform?
 struct: windows
 mzbear: hmm, can't find my win32 code.  anyway, it should be fairly straightforward
 mzbear: after all, you can pass the stdin/stdout handles to processes you create
 mzbear: so, you create two pipes
 mzbear: they're like buffers with two ends, so you keep one for yourself and pass the other to the subprocess via the startupinfo
 mzbear: CreatePipe, CreateProcessA
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-a-child-process-with-redirected-input-and-output">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-a-child-process-with-redirected-input-and-output</a> ... ah, there
 struct: Thanks Ill check it out
 mzbear: i mean, you create two pipes, one for stdin, one for stdout ... and they both have read/write handles separately.  that link has full code example
 mzbear: it's a bit messy because it's lowlevel
 struct: On the child process I can keep cin and cout right?
 mzbear: yeah, cin and cout are bound to stdin/stdout, it'll work completely transparently
 mzbear: only the parent process needs to do the messy stuff
 mzbear: ... i was going to recommend checking github for how other people use those APIs, but the first three repositories i checked had incorrect code.  ugh
 struct: Yeah, I had trouble finding stuff about it
 mzbear: stick to that microsoft's example code, it has all the details ironed down
 struct: Also microsoft mentions text files, I can skip that part right?
 mzbear: yeah, it's extra stuff for the example
 mzbear: the important parts are CreateProcessA, CreatePipe, SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES, STARTUPINFO
 mzbear: e.g. the SetHandleInformation is just for cleaniness, it's good practice to not leak unnecessary objects into child processes, but you can skip that
 struct: Thanks for your help, first time doing this kind of stuff
 mzbear: i did quite a bunch of windows programming 10 years ago.  a lot has changed, but the win32 api underneath is still the same
 mzbear: the posix apis are much simpler for this stuff
 mzbear: the process creation model is so different too
 struct: Also one more question
 struct: So if I write to stdin, the read stdout. Do I need to close stdin pipe before reading?
 mzbear: nah, both can be open, they're independent pipes
 struct: Thanks
 mzbear: for a good measure, you can create a pipe for stderr too, so you'll have three pairs of read/write handles to deal with&#160;:)
 struct: Ill plan to have stderr too
 struct: I just want to make it work first :D
 mzbear: just test it with some simple known good .exe to use as your child process, don't launch cmd.exe or anything
 mzbear: because there's another set of APIs for dealing with windows consoles, and cmd.exe uses those ... it's mostly compatible with pipes, but not 100%
 mzbear: i'm a bit surprised i can't find any clean library for dealing with this.  creating child processes is quite a common task, after all
 RoboStac: boost::process&#160;?
 mzbear: oh hey, of course boost:: has one :D
 mzbear: struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/doc/html/boost_process/tutorial.html">https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/doc/html/boost_process/tutorial.html</a>
 mzbear: it has things like bp::opstream ... for managing the things.  much much simpler, assuming you're okay with including boost in your project
 struct: Nice I think it worked
 struct: Thanks mzbear
 struct: at least the stdout worked now I will test the stdin
 struct: ok infinite loop on the writetopipe part 
 struct: bSuccess = WriteFile(g_hChildStd_IN_Wr, chBuf, dwRead, &amp;dwWritten, NULL);if (!bSuccess) break;
 struct: if I change the if i change to if(bSuccess) break;
 struct: it seems to work
 struct: but i dont think microsoft would publish it bugged
 mzbear: well, that's deliberately an infinite loop in microsoft's code
 mzbear: it loops until the pipe is closed from the other end
 struct: ah I see
 mzbear: so don't switch that around ... just don't make a loop at all if you dont want a loop&#160;:)
 struct: Also 1 more question, I seem to need to close child stdin pipe to be able to use the stdout, does this mean I need to keep opening and closing them inbetween?
 mzbear: no, you're doing something wrong
 mzbear: your reads/writes are blocking, i believe
 mzbear: it might be a good idea to start writing an io loop around WaitForMultipleObjects
 mzbear: also, WriteFileEx for async writes... ugh.  you know what.  this is probably going to take you quite a while :D
 struct: if (!CloseHandle(g_hChildStd_IN_Wr))
 Astrobytes: This is why I never got into Windows programming
 mzbear: let me take a look into boost::process and its async api to see if it's any less painful
 struct: This line closes the stdin right?
 struct: from what I understand
 mzbear: if you close that pipe, you wont be able to reopen it
 struct: If I dont close it I cant go to the next&#160;:/
 mzbear: but yes, that closes the write handle for stdin
 mzbear: sure you can.  why not?
 mzbear: unless you want to terminate the child process entirely
 struct: I tried to coment the line and it gets stuck
 struct: It writes, then never reads
 mzbear: trying to make code work without understanding what each API function does is a recipe for disaster, btw
 mzbear: that's quite a lot of ground to cover if you've never done IO with win32 api, though
 struct: Its just for a simple thing.
 Astrobytes: Simple things in Win32 are not as simple as POSIX
 Astrobytes: Especially if you're more familiar with the latter
 mzbear: win32 just has a different flavor.  very different flavor.  i only abandoned the platform because microsoft started doing super scummy shit
 struct: mzbear if I close the handle
 struct: and then create it again
 struct: ius it possible?
 mzbear: not possible
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 mzbear: the pipe you gave the child is the pipe you gave the child
 mzbear: even if you close your end, you can't change the other end
 struct: ok i comented and it works now
 struct: lol
 mzbear: you THINK it works now
 struct: Well its not stuck in an infinite loop now
 struct: before it was getting stuck on readfrom pipep
 Astrobytes: struct, have you gone through the usual intro to win32 programming stuff?
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: I would recommend it, just to get a feel for how things work, it's really its own thing
 Astrobytes: mzbear would you agree?
 struct: also if (!bSuccess) break; works again
 struct: I dont know why
 struct: I guess its magic
 mzbear: if he only wants to get his task done and nothing else, i dont think he has motivation to read up on win32 basics&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Might make it easier but eh, there ya go
 struct: yeah, i just wanted to get this done
 struct: Maybe in the future ill check it
 struct: but now I would like to finish STC for once
 Astrobytes: you don't plan on... an actual UI or anything right
 struct: I do
 Astrobytes: *GUI
 struct: im gonna use imgui
 Astrobytes: ah right yeah, forgot about that
 Astrobytes: will you have game visualisation?
 struct: I want to make local referee, so I can tune stuff localy with gui
 struct: Yes
 Astrobytes: just openGL or SFML or something
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 struct: I dont know what its called
 struct: but imgui can also draw shapes
 struct: So Im gonna use that
 struct: It supports opengl, directx...
 Astrobytes: yeah, I mean, I would draw your stuff in openGL or whatever and use imgui as your GUI
 struct: ah no
 struct: Ill do everything in imgui
 Astrobytes: that seems strange
 mzbear: less new things to learn
 struct: yeah mzbear is right again :p
 mzbear: the more new technologies you're learning while working on a project, the more likely it is to fail
 mzbear: opengl is quite a swamp to deal with, too.  the pre-4.5 stateful APIs are error prone and horrible to get into, and guarantee your first few iterations of the rendering code are going to be messed up
 mzbear: and since Apple will never support the new opengl apis officially, it's a troublesome thing if you want your code to be multiplatform one day
 darkhorse64: You should read vulkan API doc, you will find out that OpenGL is really designed for noobs compared to it
 mzbear: vulkan is super explicit about everything :D
 darkhorse64: explicit as in "verbose", 3K LOC to draw a mere triangle
 mzbear: 3k loc to setup things
 Astrobytes: jeeze, openGL++
 Astrobytes: *jeez
 mzbear: i mean, this is great example:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mackron/vkbind/blob/master/examples/01_Fundamentals/01_Fundamentals.c">https://github.com/mackron/vkbind/blob/master/examples/01_Fundamentals/01_Fundamentals.c</a>
 mzbear: completely flat example how to use vulkan apis, without any architecture whatsoever
 mzbear: so you can follow the RAW api without any distractions
 Astrobytes: my point regarding imgui though, is that it's supposed to work with some kind of graphical renderer no? So what are you using to display it struct?
 struct: ah directx
 mzbear: while imgui requires a rendering backend, you can just copypaste that initialization from somewhere
 struct: ^
 struct: They provide examples
 struct: I could use any of them tbh
 Astrobytes: then you'll be drawing via directx then, this was my original question
 mzbear: but he doesn't have to touch the DX apis&#160;:)
 mzbear: and replacing the backend is a nobrainer
 Astrobytes: Depends on what he wants to draw
 Astrobytes: and yeah
 mzbear: if he's feeling particularly fancy, he could even grab some rendering middleware such as bgfx and run imgui on top of that, to completely abstract out the underlying rendering api ... this looks fancy:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pr0g/sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter">https://github.com/pr0g/sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter</a>
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pr0g/sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter/blob/main/main.cpp">https://github.com/pr0g/sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter/blob/main/main.cpp</a> - fairly straightforward to use too
 Astrobytes: I've used it with OpenGL and also with SFML (built on OpenGL)
 Astrobytes: That one looks simple enough too
 Astrobytes: didn't see bgfx before now mzbear
 mzbear: i ran into it years ago, and it seems to have matured quite a bit more since then
 mzbear: hell, minecraft has attribution for bgfx ... does bedrock edition use it?!
 mzbear: i really like that they list the c++ libraries they used:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/attribution">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/attribution</a>
 mzbear: so you can google each of them to check them out :D
 Astrobytes: not a game I've ever been into but yes, nice they credit where credit is due
 Astrobytes: *give credit
 mzbear: hmm did the chat glitch out
 struct: What do you mean mzbear?
 mzbear: the username list only shows moderators and me
 struct: iirc it only shows the users that you can see messages from on chat
 mzbear: i sent some private messages and wasn't sure if the person was online, but it seems he was since i got a reply.  but he doesn't appear in the world chat user list
 struct: and moderators
 Astrobytes: yeh, that's normal
 Astrobytes: not ideal
 struct: Better than having page freeze on contests :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 LastRick: Interesting, i saw that earlier today. I thought it strange that it was nothing but mods and me on. Like I had snuck into a members only party
 Astrobytes: trust me, the enormous list is much worse
 Astrobytes: I think external clients show the full list?
 struct: yeah, also for tabbing
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 struct: Now i must trust that my referee has no bugs :D
 Astrobytes: You've not actually tested your referee despite doing all this runner stuff?
 VizGhar: what game?
 struct: I think i tested it, I just need to port it to be able to send inputs and such
 struct: STC VizGhar
 struct: The score it generates after every move is correct
 struct: This was done by pressing "play my code" :D
 struct: hundreds of times
 MSmits: yay solver is almost fully functioning. Only one more thing. Check here: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517892423">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517892423</a>
 MSmits: it says the score
 struct: early game doesnt seem random anymore
 struct: is this true?
 MSmits: nope, still random
 MSmits: it just avoids giving away boxes
 MSmits: which is why it doesnt seem random
 MSmits: I'm up to 2136 lines now
 MSmits: But i will have to duplicate a part of the negamax to get the actual move out of it
 MSmits: then i need an early game search as well. That's gonna be 3k total or so, might have to start minifying&#160;:)
 MSmits: first lemme submit to check if i didnt add bugs ( = likely)
 MSmits: yay, my prediction is correct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517893025">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517893025</a>
 struct: lol
 struct: I was looking at yellow text
 MSmits: no the message is white
 MSmits: currently it doesnt solve if the endgame is still complex (with splits), so i need to fix that
 MSmits: or at least, it does solve, but i cant get the move out, only the value
 MSmits: i hate this about negamax
 MSmits: it ruins the neatness of the code, to have a different function for depth = 0
 Astrobytes: duplicate your negamax?
 MSmits: yeah, to get the move
 MSmits: you run 1 negamax function that also returns the move, by reference, and the deeper layers just return the value
 MSmits: i dont want every layer to return moves, thats pointless
 MSmits: maybe i am overthinking it and the compiler will take care of it
 Astrobytes: you don't want ever layer to use the best move from the previous? Or am I not getting something
 Astrobytes: *every
 MSmits: no, what i mean is, technically negamax only return the value of the board right?
 MSmits: it doesnt tell you which move is best
 MSmits: its int Negamax ()
 Astrobytes: well you can build that into it trivially
 MSmits: but when you do, you get two different negamaxes
 MSmits: the highest level needs to give you a move
 MSmits: all the deeper ones dont, you dont care about them, only the value of their boards
 MSmits: so generally i built a top level negamax which iterates over all moves and returns the best move and a different negamax that is called from the first one and only returns the value
 struct: ok I think I finally understand this pipe thing more
 MSmits: The thing is that this solver negamax is extremely complex, so i need to do a lot of work to duplicate it and avoid bugging
 MSmits: it calls other functions too, in which moves are tried. It's a mess
 Astrobytes: why not just make a little iteratively deepening loop that calls the negamax and returns the best move from each depth?
 Astrobytes: well, via a pointer
 MSmits: well thats what annoys me. Why do it from each depth
 MSmits: you'd be doing it thousands of times
 MSmits: i guess thats how everyone does it
 MSmits: it's just annoying&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: that's what ab pruning, aspiration windows etc are for
 MSmits: you'll still be doing it thousands of times, instead of just 1 time
 MSmits: at the root
 Astrobytes: move ordering, blah blah
 MSmits: move ordering is done by value
 Astrobytes: well, I'm not coding your code so
 MSmits: I'm just ranting :P
 MSmits: I much prefer mcts
 MSmits: maybe i'll use that for early game
 MSmits: would be cool, both searches in one bot
 Astrobytes: your best move from previous depth can be used in your move ordering
 MSmits: yes, but you dont need to return the move
 MSmits: you store the boardstate 
 MSmits: oh right, you put the move in the boardstate
 MSmits: as some index
 MSmits: I did that before, it's a bit different though
 Astrobytes: Like I said, the day you stop questioning...
 Astrobytes:  :)
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 MSmits: in this case a "move" is a complicated thing. It's basically one of those chains in the D&amp;B graph
 masknksnvsndvo: wassup  nibba
 Astrobytes: That's a little more than an individual move I guess yeah, you wanna be careful with that I think if your doing it like that
 Astrobytes: *you're
 Astrobytes: masknksnvsndvo: pardon?
 Astrobytes: Anyway MSmits, I've had a long arduous day today, I shall see you tomorrow. Goodnight all

 hchasens: What version of java does the site use?
 hchasens: Trying to figure out which API i should be looking at

 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 jrke: Msmits your endgame values printing helped me detecting a bug - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517905763">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517905763</a> turn 73
 MSmits: cool&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah i saw that game 
 MSmits: you handled the loop wrong
 MSmits: my bot is now near 2400 lines
 MSmits: tomorrow I will try to put in an early game search. Might take a while, if it even works
 MSmits: otherwise I got no chance against nr 1
 jrke: mine is still 416 lines
 MSmits: yeah most of my code is the solver
 MSmits: it's kinda cool though, i can solve most games in less than 1 ms halfway through
 MSmits: i could actually run a minimax for the last few moves right before the end game
 MSmits: with the endgame itself as the depth limit
 MSmits: that way the last few lines could be placed perfectly
 MSmits: i think it would help a little, but may not be enough to beat nr 1
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/msmits</a>
 MSmits: so weird
 MSmits: why 15-0 Kovi? Earlier i pushed him to nr 2
 jrke: even i didn't get that a small change gives me 100% winrate against kovi and few changes 100% loserate
 MSmits: I think it has something to do with how the endgames are formed. If your style of play prevents complex endgames, then my solver doesnt help me much
 MSmits: against kovi, games might get more complicated
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517905990">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517905990</a>
 MSmits: look at this
 MSmits: bunch of splits, pretty complex
 MSmits: i am guessing your games are not often like that
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/jrke">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/jrke</a> mine winrates are more complicated 
 jrke: 0% against nieren and 100% against jbyepez lol
 MSmits: btw, take a look at the kovi example i shared. He made his mistake at frame 79
 MSmits: if you have a loop cnnected to a string (pan and panhandle), always do the handle first. He played inside the loop and then i took it all
 jrke: he should have done that bottom right chain on turn 79 right?
 MSmits: yes but i just saw a worse mistake in that game
 MSmits: the chain at 70
 MSmits: he took it fully
 MSmits: he should have kept control
 MSmits: (give last 2 to me)
 jrke: yes
 MSmits: btw solver doesnt always update
 MSmits: it only updates when it had to actually solve
 MSmits: so if the other guy makes a mistake, it may not register immediately
 MSmits: as long as my bot doesnt need to think about the next move, it wont try
 jrke: yes
 MSmits: why waste calctime
 jrke: because no use for that
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: this gamr vs remi:

 MSmits: so close
 ZarthaxX: hi struct&#160;:*
 MSmits: also a complex endgame
 MSmits: he plays it well
 jrke: hmm to complex
 MSmits: but neither makes a mistake
 MSmits: the game is decided in the first half&#160;:(
 jrke: thats the reason he is first
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: i should randomize my seed :P
 MSmits: or i play the same random moves
 MSmits: well... why bother, i will be trying a different bot anyway
 MSmits: tomorrow.... sleep now

 eulerscheZahl: dbdr is awakegood morning
 dbdr: moin
 eulerscheZahl: i reported the stdout of the viewer 1 or 2 days ago, but the forum is probably the better place here
 dbdr: well, gives another chance&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: a draw with 6-6 lives
 dbdr: a public bug/feature tracker would be nice
 dbdr: with voting
 dbdr: or maybe it would become chaos? :D
 dbdr: yeah, playing it safe :D
 eulerscheZahl: yeahyou can filter the forum by category, but no easy view with status and all + bugs are reported at different locations
 dbdr: exactly
 dbdr: would be fun to see "oldest issue still open" :D
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i even see tiny bugs that aren't relevant enough for me to report
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/settings/confidentiality">https://www.codingame.com/settings/confidentiality</a>like that button recently, if your language is set to English
 dbdr: Mettre à jour
 eulerscheZahl: one should update that translation
 dbdr: it's an expression in english too, same as "déjà-vu"
 eulerscheZahl: i know deja vu
 dbdr: or schadenfreude
 dbdr: or kindergarten
 dbdr: "english"
 eulerscheZahl: ok, call me uneducated then :D
 dbdr: actually I was messing with you, mettre à jour is not used, afaik
 dbdr: just reminded me of the cases where they use foreign words/expresions
 dbdr: I wonder if their whole interface is in french first
 eulerscheZahl: and now french users are forced to read english for the contest
 dbdr: and english is just a translation. seems dangerous
 eulerscheZahl: did you see any complains or translation questions on the fr chat?
 dbdr: non
 eulerscheZahl: the CG interface was Fr first
 elderlybeginner: What's the simple strategy for moving uboot in ocean of code?
 eulerscheZahl: yes see that by looking at the API
 eulerscheZahl: 1 = fr, 2 = en
 dbdr: oh, it's U-boats? :D
 dbdr: elderlybeginner for moving, just remember where you have already been
 elderlybeginner: yea, Uboat :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: how do you call a piece pf bakery swimming under the water?
 eulerscheZahl: an U-Brot
 dbdr: move to one of the four cells where you haven't been
 dbdr: :grin:
 elderlybeginner: yea, any simple algoritm for efficient choosing a path?
 dbdr: ah, it's U-Boot originally?
 dbdr: is Boot a german word?
 eulerscheZahl: U-Boot is the german word, Boot = boat
 eulerscheZahl: and Brot = bread
 dbdr: elderlybeginner what I said does not need a complex path finding
 dbdr: just looking at the next cell
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/game-fishy-adventures/blob/master/config/test1.json#L3-L4">https://github.com/CodinGame/game-fishy-adventures/blob/master/config/test1.json#L3-L4</a>see, Fr was first
 dbdr: if you want better, look up floodfill
 elderlybeginner: that's not enough, getting in corners and surfacing too much
 dbdr: OK, but that's one game
 dbdr: right, then I would say floodfill
 dbdr: I knew about Brot :D
 Nixerrr: Cool nick elderlybeginner
 Nixerrr: And lol euler at u-brot
 elderlybeginner: i was looking into snake algoritms, and longest path or hamilton seems over power
 dbdr: I think I learned Schiff, not Boot
 dbdr: sounds more german
 eulerscheZahl: elderlybeginner another way: file:///home/eulerschezahl/Pictures/tronExtend.png
 eulerscheZahl: Schiff = ship, a Boot is smaller
 dbdr: file:// link 
 eulerscheZahl: damn
 eulerscheZahl: when drag and drop to imgur fails
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/F91Luso">https://imgur.com/a/F91Luso</a>
 dbdr: oh, that's your local user name? that's long
 Nixerrr: I like German rye brot
 eulerscheZahl: you see an orange path (me)
 elderlybeginner: probably, it works on your comp. :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: i extend the horizontal line first (just going in 1 direction)
 dbdr: I instinctly used the &lt; &gt; arrows on that imgur to change the turns :D
 eulerscheZahl: then add a loop on the orange extension as soon as i can (green)
 eulerscheZahl: and extend the green in blue and so on
 eulerscheZahl: that's a good filling heuristic i thinkbut not that great for the contest, easy to track
 elderlybeginner: @euler: what algorithm is this?
 eulerscheZahl: don't think that it has a name, came up with it myself
 dbdr: but going up is the wrong choice there
 dbdr: down has more space
 eulerscheZahl: the orange at the top left is the final position
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't finish drawing it
 dbdr: the eulerfill
 dbdr: ah ok. the bad choice was made ealier, but then the map was different
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a bad choice
 dbdr: OOC is simpler, opponent does not affect your path
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: would be fun to lose without knowing that the opponent has been there
 dbdr: the space on the left border was bigger
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I internal errored only when eulerscheZahl shows up
 dbdr: it's wrong, knowing what we know now
 elderlybeginner: you were using it for tron, I guess, you try to get some space for yourself and survive as long as possible in that space
 dbdr: probably as not wrong at the time
 eulerscheZahl: game error or some 504 request?
 eulerscheZahl: but the contest will get an update today
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Internal game error
 eulerscheZahl: i know why
 eulerscheZahl: we started with a prototype, not tested that well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I mispelled a variable name, fixed it...no internal error
 eulerscheZahl: a bug made the BFS for torpedo range check slow
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: code please
 dbdr: [2020-03-23T00:30:01Z INFO  recorder] Challenge: ocean-of-code[2020-03-23T02:30:18Z WARN  recorder] Waited to stabilization for more than 7200s, giving up[2020-03-23T02:30:19Z INFO  recorder] Multi: tower-dereference[2020-03-23T02:30:19Z INFO  recorder] Multi: onitama
 eulerscheZahl: 2h without stable ranking
 dbdr: I added a fail safe for when a single submit is suck for more than 2 hours
 dbdr: but for one player. I think you misunderstood yesterday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so i can submit?
 eulerscheZahl: that's the referee bug: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/commit/562ee7ab052c5c9686ffe2ab6cce181a063da936">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/commit/562ee7ab052c5c9686ffe2ab6cce181a063da936</a>
 dbdr: it does not need a moment with no submit in progress
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i added like 250 lines of code to hopefully get above wood
 eulerscheZahl: if you shoot outside of the map, you can mape the game crash
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't crash offlinei tested before the contest, worked fine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh that mighta been it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: torpedo 4 -1
 eulerscheZahl: but on the server it exceeds a time limit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: since variable was wrong 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it still tries to use a 0 instead
 dbdr: CG has another bug then. they should detect a referee crash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm gonna sub, i tired
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't care if i make it
 eulerscheZahl: they make the referee crash just like players, when the time is exceeded
 dbdr: but they don't handle it well it seems
 eulerscheZahl: but it seems they don't (always?) count the match then
 eulerscheZahl: right
 dbdr: they also keep waiting for it to finish :D
 dbdr: oh, the referee was going into an endless loop?
 eulerscheZahl: and you can't trust the quality of a refereeespecially now, that we can upload games without having a contest
 eulerscheZahl: not endless
 eulerscheZahl: but 4s for a BFS to see that the target is out of range
 dbdr: definitely. every component should expect the others to fail
 dbdr: chaos monkey&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: if (next cell is free) {
 eulerscheZahl: that takes some iterations to mark everything as visited
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl did you expect or suspect there would be many ties?
 eulerscheZahl: i had no expectations
 eulerscheZahl: but the turn limit will be increased to 600
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: hm, what would be the consequence to say that in case of tie, player 2 wins?
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 dbdr: or add extra time first&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: and angry recurs_e
 dbdr: to avoid draws. like in soccer
 eulerscheZahl: sudden death
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: set both lives to 1
 eulerscheZahl: and add more islands randomly
 dbdr: if there are too many draws, ranking will be more imprecise
 dbdr: evil, but random is not good
 dbdr: if it's deterministic though...
 dbdr: global cooling, sea levels drops
 dbdr: or the water boils
 dbdr: Zenoscave it might be unbalanced the other way
 dbdr: too early to tell
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 7 battles still spinning, stuck at 35th in wood2, oh well
 dbdr: isn't it caused by wrong commands?
 dbdr: you could avoid those...
 Zenoscave: wrong commands cause timeouts on engine?
 dbdr: I think so, will be fixed today
 dbdr: the bug eulerscheZahl linked to
 eulerscheZahl: but you might get unlucky and face an opponent doing the bad command?
 Zenoscave: What is the ranking that results from it? 0/0? 
 dbdr: ah, yes. esp in wood
 dbdr: could be a situation where even emh could not get out of wood 2 :D
 Zenoscave: That would be scary
 dbdr: need to create alts with correct outputs to increase your chances
 dbdr: and opponents doing the opposite
 dbdr: say to keep reCurse in wood 2&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 25 wins, 9 losses, 7 spinning...stuck at 42nd in wood2
 eulerscheZahl: the 4th game result beside win, loss, draw
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: CG logic is quaternary
 dbdr: hm, it's snowing
 dbdr: 2 days ago it was 20C
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, gn guys
 kovi: where is it snowing?
 dbdr: Budapest
 dbdr: just a few flakes, not a lot, but still
 dbdr: might depend which district&#160;:)
 kovi: yeah. sun is shining for now. but there were heavy clouds half an hour ago
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/0PmA7W.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/0PmA7W.jpg</a>
 dbdr: I have sun and snow&#160;:)
 Nixerrr: I'm not seeing any snow :O
 Nixerrr: 8th district
 eulerscheZahl: you could host a coding hub
 dbdr: the magyar connection takes over the chat
 eulerscheZahl: wait, bad timing&#160;:(
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: do you know each other in person?
 kovi: nope
 dbdr: nope
 Nixerrr: nope
 dbdr: nem
 kovi: wood 1. gah, silence stops my detection
 eulerscheZahl: you just promoted?
 kovi: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: it's still possible&#160;:)
 kovi: probably. just not as simply as before
 eulerscheZahl: did you need resubmits because of stuck games?
 dbdr: wood promotions have never been easy. except the first  5 minutes :D
 eulerscheZahl: i blame CG for using the wrong boss code&#160;:(
 Nixerrr: :rage:
 dbdr: put the blame on CGame, boys
 Scarfield: Blame Canada
 Nixerrr: Why Canada?
 eulerscheZahl: southpark reference?
 Nixerrr: Ah not a fan
 Scarfield: from south park yes
 Scarfield: but. but. its the best :D
 dbdr: mine is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY2IpSCV-Nk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY2IpSCV-Nk</a>
 Scarfield: lol my grandfather often mentions Rita Hayworth
 dbdr: TIL Scarfield is my grandson
 Nixerrr: :joy_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: don't quote me dbdri got an email
 dbdr: fix your settings
 dbdr: lol, with bad russian dubbing at the end
 eulerscheZahl: on the topic of your post: right now, i don't see how
 dbdr: worse than dubbing, how is this called? a single person dubs the whole film
 eulerscheZahl: i can set a higher limit for the 2nd turnat the cost of having less turns in total
 Scarfield: commentary?
 Nixerrr: voiceover? not sure, but we used to have 
 dbdr: I was not blaming the game, just saying it's unfortunate
 eulerscheZahl: ah, ok
 dbdr: end of the video
 Nixerrr: used to have Star Wars with Russian voiceover
 dbdr: sounds fun
 eulerscheZahl: i struggled with that some times too
 Nixerrr: I didn't understand a word but it was still a lot of fun as a kid
 dbdr: with no emotions in the voice
 Nixerrr: haha yeah
 Scarfield: yea its voice over&#160;:)
 Nixerrr: "I'm your father." "No."
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. vox codei 2: get the move patters firstthen the solver only has 100ms, not 1s
 dbdr: "I'm your grandfather"
 Scarfield: xD
 Nixerrr: no u
 dbdr: we are each other's grandfathers
 Nixerrr: mind -&gt; blown
 Nixerrr: That would be a great twist in an SF movie
 Nixerrr: If it didn't involve incest
 Scarfield: its kinda in Back to the Future
 dbdr: since Adam and Eve, it's always been incest
 dbdr: just at low percentage
 Nixerrr: Heinlein's "All You Zombies" anyone?
 Nixerrr: Cool short story with time paradoxes from the Golden Age of science fiction
 dbdr: whose gradfather are you Nixerrr?&#160;;)
 Scarfield: doesnt ring a bell, but have been thinking about rewatching the old planet of the apes, great movies iirc&#160;:)
 Nixerrr: Yet to be revealed
 eulerscheZahl: they were on the earth the whole time :scream:
 Nixerrr: Hope someone decent. Would hate have asshole offsprings
 eulerscheZahl: Nixerrr jr jr
 Nixerrr: *hat to have
 Nixerrr: *hate to have
 Nixerrr: Haha yeah
 emh: good morning&#160;:)
 egaetan: grrr
 emh: no nightly submits? don't see much new battles. but still no 1 yay hehe&#160;:)
 sean12: good evening from nz
 emh: hi egaetan
 egaetan: good morning
 eulerscheZahl: the contest is a full month long, no need to rush
 egaetan: eulerscheZahl what else&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: procrastinate
 emh: nah. one-up the slow turtling Terrans by a zergling rush&#160;:)
 dbdr: do you know the story of The Turtle and the Toad
 emh: is it anything similar to the Hare and The Turtle?
 dbdr: yes, CG marathon version
 emh: oh hehe. yes I don't suppose I will have the stamina to follow through whole compo
 emh: let alone come up with good new ideas
 emh: but that's why I'm enjoying my time in the sunshine now
 eulerscheZahl: get some vitamin D
 emh: oh thx eulerscheZahl forgot to take my vitamins this morning actually
 emh: 2 multivitamins, 1 vitamin D, 1 magnesium
 eulerscheZahl: your body can generate vitamin D in the sunlight
 eulerscheZahl: just show some skin
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeZe2qPLPh0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeZe2qPLPh0</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but the further you are in the north, the harder it gets
 eulerscheZahl: in german fary tales the rabbit has to race against a hedgehog
 emh: egaetan thanks for pushing me up. tonowak was eerily close
 egaetan: :p
 emh: and dbdr thanks too&#160;:)
 dbdr: np
 tonowak: Hello. I see I'm still in top5&#160;:) gg emh
 emh: gg&#160;:)
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441610576">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441610576</a>
 dbdr: uboats barely interracted
 dbdr: it will be changed to 600 turns right? today?
 emh: oh I heard 300. so 300 per player then? thought it was 150 per player. but not sure
 dbdr: in any case that should mean fewer draws&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: we wanted to update the game yesterday already, have to wait for CG. pretty sure it will be changed today
 dbdr: how many turns?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 times as many
 dbdr: nice
 emh: wooow
 eulerscheZahl: right now there's another bug: player 1 has an extra turn
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: starting and ending the game
 eulerscheZahl: will be fixed too
 dbdr: off by one errors are hard
 eulerscheZahl: and frame count will further increase, don't be confused
 eulerscheZahl: splitting chained actions into multiple frames
 dbdr: oh, each step separate?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: yeah, that will be much clearer
 dbdr: very nice
 emh: will that affect our code? our it's just visual?
 emh: *or
 dbdr: visual I think
 egaetan: it will affect Illedan firing like a xxxx at the end of the game
 dbdr: obviously more turns can affect strategy
 dbdr: should not break the code
 emh: now is the time to regret not using a constant for total number of turns :p
 emh: well, I think I used it only 3 places
 emh: and can search/replace
 dbdr: I even use WIDTH and HEIGHT :D
 emh: I used width and height from input
 emh: but was in a hurry when adding some code so didn't add constant for number of turns hehe
 AntiSquid: hey when is the push to bronze happening&#160;?
 dbdr: I use:assert_eq!(input.read(), WIDTH);
 AntiSquid: it's kinda annoying i can submit a bot that beats boss 100% but can't reach it and don't feel like making specific changes just to promote
 emh: dbdr wow that's conservative
 dbdr: well, I have to read it
 dbdr: might as well do something with it&#160;:)
 dbdr: but better to have constants
 eulerscheZahl: i use Width and Height toobut torpedo range is hardcoded
 eulerscheZahl: but only used at a single place, as a function
 AntiSquid: hardcoded in what way?
 dbdr: use 4 in the ode
 eulerscheZahl:         internal bool InTorpedoRange(Cell cell)
 AntiSquid: does that always work?
 eulerscheZahl: dist uses BFS dist
 eulerscheZahl: cached at turn 1
 AntiSquid: adding to todo list 
 eulerscheZahl: will be part of the new statement on update: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/torpedoRange.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/torpedoRange.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: asked too many times
 dbdr: nice
 dbdr: the other FAQ is "can my torpedos hurt me"
 eulerscheZahl: me, maybe i should add that too
 dbdr: A torpedo requires 3 charge actions to be ready. When fully charged, the torpedo can be fired at an arbitrary water position within a range of 4 cells. This allows the torpedo's path to contain corners and go around islands, but not through them. The damage of the explosion is 2 on the cell itself and 1 and all neighbors (including diagonal ones). 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't say that it does *not* hurt yourself
 dbdr: "A torpedo can hurt the submarine of its owner"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and then the same again for mines i guess
 dbdr: yes, though beginners only deal with torps&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: " You can also damage yourself with a torpedo."
 dbdr: wow, lots of snow now
 eulerscheZahl: should be enough to add
 eulerscheZahl: code word for cocaine?
 dbdr: :no_mouth:
 dbdr: I mean, who does a contest without snow?
 dbdr: need the energy boost
 Scarfield: let it snow let it snow
 emh: I'm using resharper in visual studio on old laptop. such delay on input. resharper is slow
 kovi: if the ocean freeze, it will be harder to surface
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: you got the snow now kovi?
 kovi: yeah
 dbdr: ok, i'm not crazy
 Nixerrr: Yeah I got it too now
 dbdr: :relieved:
 Nixerrr: Still could be a collective hallucination
 dbdr: caused by too much OOC
 Scarfield: feeling warm is the last stage of hypothermia
 dbdr: feeling frustrated is the last stage before promotion
 dbdr: hm, previous submit ended at #26.resub same code =&gt; #12
 dbdr: 12 is more consistent with my previous rank, will say the 1st one was the outlier&#160;:)
 Schneewittchen: Is it just for me only or do you others also see this squishy squashy submarine thingy
 eulerscheZahl: see what?
 emh: stretching
 Nixerrr: The enlarged smarines?
 dbdr: there are display bugs with silence I think
 eulerscheZahl: will be fixed soon
 emh: does CGSpunk work with contest?
 emh: want to get me some stderr
 eulerscheZahl: it stopped working years ago
 AntiSquid: it broke down completely last i checked
 emh: oohhh ok
 eulerscheZahl: google CG enhancerbut functionality is a little different
 AntiSquid: quite laggy that one even on new pc :p
 eulerscheZahl: and breaks puzzle IDEs
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl you have 1K lead in general now. thanks to UTG multi?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: I also took away from the AntiSquid danger&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: royale got points too, but some players didn't
 dbdr: I missed the day when it was counted. was not today
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/70b8b4135b1d037bd271ce9e0eb8bd923563913">https://www.codingame.com/profile/70b8b4135b1d037bd271ce9e0eb8bd923563913</a>wait, i think he got the pointsjust not displayed
 eulerscheZahl: i gained about 500 points over royale
 eulerscheZahl: and i played cultist wars recently
 dbdr: not displayed? :O
 eulerscheZahl: check the multiplayer points section
 dbdr: yes, I mean that's strange
 eulerscheZahl: but if you sum it up, he gets the points
 dbdr: CG backend code seems to have a lot of corner cases
 eulerscheZahl: once they managed to break the opponent selection, you could not add a playerbut only for the old games without bosses (BTTC, PR2)
 AntiSquid: dbdr idk ... was intending to pass you with XR, but i failed to even get legend for now :p
 dbdr: AntiSquid bring it on
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/commits/master">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/commits/master</a>
 dbdr: lol, that second commit message
 AntiSquid: i need to do XR and CR now&#160;:/
 dbdr: messed it up when I did it manually
 dbdr: and OOC
 Nixerrr: Hey where's MK? Was he banned or just inactive?
 AntiSquid: self isolating from chat due to CSB memes pandemic
 dbdr: :D
 Nixerrr: Haha ok
 Nixerrr: Not that I miss him, just curious
 dbdr: Nixerrr do you think there will be lockdown soon in Hungary?
 dbdr: schools still open? wtf?
 Nixerrr: Schools have been closed for 2 weeks
 Nixerrr: Do you really live in Budapest? :D
 dbdr: ah, was reading old news
 dbdr: I do, but I don't go to school
 AntiSquid: they pull junior doctors one year earlier from uni to support at the hospitals
 AntiSquid: in UK
 Nixerrr: Yeah, more severe measures are coming soon
 dbdr: and I read more international news, not hungarian ones
 AntiSquid: guess you get quicker on the job xp
 Nixerrr: Gotcha'
 dbdr: my company decided work from home for everyone, but I think it's voluntary
 dbdr: 2 weeks ago I think. clever people
 AntiSquid: hey just stay positive? china is fine . they recovered
 Nixerrr: My wife's company switched to remote last week
 dbdr: govt needs to step up
 dbdr: once the situation actually looks bad it's way too late
 Nixerrr: They need to do more tests imo
 AntiSquid: but tests take a long time&#160;:/
 Nixerrr: There are too many death cases compared to the verified infections
 Nixerrr: Numbers don't add up compared to neighboring countries
 dbdr: most people won't have symptoms
 AntiSquid: not every country does quick tests like US
 dbdr: and you can't test everyone
 dbdr: so I think distancing is the way to go
 AntiSquid: there are people with 0 symptoms ...
 dbdr: if you start early, it can be less extreme
 Nixerrr: I listened to a good podcast by experts, they said you can start too early with the extreme measures
 Nixerrr: Timing is delicate and no one really knows what's going to work in the long run
 dbdr: yeah, not too extreme
 Nixerrr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-344313169/episode-92-the-doctors-weigh-in-on-covid-19">https://soundcloud.com/user-344313169/episode-92-the-doctors-weigh-in-on-covid-19</a>
 Nixerrr: In case anyone wants to hear more of COVID-19 :D
 AntiSquid: idk
 AntiSquid: i hear it every day
 AntiSquid: every single day, no way around it
 dbdr: probably a good idea the contest was not plagueinc&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i played it back when it was 100% free
 AntiSquid: beat hard level, not sure how much it changed
 AntiSquid: dbdr do you also think contest got delayed because it was basically plague inc port? :D
 Illedan: Contest did not get delayed?
 AntiSquid: the official one
 Illedan: It's still on the contest page if you use the Arrows to navigate to the next..
 dbdr: was supposed to be march
 dbdr: no idea why
 Nixerrr: Code4Life would be a good fit too :mask: :thermometer_face:
 Illedan: :P
 dbdr: Code4YourLife
 AntiSquid: the one in may might not be the one meant for march ... 
 Nixerrr: It's the Illuminati's doing
 Nixerrr: They pulled the March contest
 emh: jq -r '.frames[] | .stderr' frames.json
 emh: command to get stderr from JSON
 dbdr: command line power&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: :o
 Illedan: gratz on keeping 1st emh. I see you stayed up until 2 :o
 emh: Illedan thanks and yes :L)
 emh: *&#160;:)
 egaetan: gratz emh
 emh: thx&#160;:)
 emh: time to try dotTrace
 AntiSquid: JBM haskell stream? :o
 Lks10: haskell stream would be kinda spicy
 pde-bakk: hello world
 Lks10: hiya
 dbdr: hi Lks10. haskell stream will continue
 Lks10: its in 12 hours right??
 JBM: yes it will
 JBM: show must go on
 Illedan: :tada:
 dbdr: ruin haskell ranking =&gt; mission accomplished&#160;;)
 JBM: my pleasure
 Lks10: I have a lot of respect for making a bot in haskell
 JBM: why's that?
 JBM: it's not harder than any other general-purpose language
 dbdr: probably easier when you are fluent
 dbdr: higher level
 Lks10: The people at my uni disagree that haskell isn't harder than other lanuages.
 AntiSquid: will it be a purely functional bot? 
 JBM: AntiSquid: for which meaning of purely functional?
 Illedan: Game is updated now
 Illedan: I love your PADDING message emh :D
 JFB: Illedan - what new?
 Illedan: Multiple frames for multiple actionsMessage in bottom for what action was done.Other color on sonarLess tooltips
 Illedan: A bugfix for crashingOrange text shows
 Illedan: And 300 frames for each player
 JFB: Looks nice
 AntiSquid: Illedan is there a new wood boss coming in? or at least resubmit? there's a bottleneck in wood, 
 Illedan: New boss too
 Illedan: It now uses SURFACE on the first turn and every 50 turns
 emh: who dares to submit?
 emh: with new rules
 Illedan: :scream:
 Illedan: The more the merrier
 Illedan: To get crashes or errors earlier
 Illedan: plz
 emh: Illedan thanks for padding comment&#160;:)
 Illedan: And no more Wierd shaped subs :facepalm:
 AntiSquid: ya the issue is i think that although wood boss is now weaker, you can't reach it if you don't beat everyone before that
 egaetan: 300 frames each&#160;?
 Illedan: yeah
 egaetan: 600 frames total&#160;?
 Illedan: 599
 JFB: Max
 Illedan: As both players uses round 1 at once
 Illedan: and earlier the first player had first and last round :P
 JFB: Illedan Default player == Wood Boss?
 Illedan: ye
 Illedan: All bosses have the same code
 emh: I guess mines will be much more important with long games
 Illedan: Most games ended before 200 anyway
 JFB: It is possible to use in silver boss from bronse, and so on?
 Illedan: haha :P
 JFB: So default in each league from bos of previous on?
 JFB: *boss of previous one
 Illedan: Nah, for Silver and up we will pick a player
 JFB: Yes, I know
 AntiSquid: i think it's still same old wood boss
 JFB: But it is possible to make such change&#160;?
 Illedan: Not for us
 JFB: Or it is impossible because Default boss is on github?
 Illedan: AntiSquid, it's the same. But uses Surface. Making it much easier to track
 dbdr: nice, things happens with careful players now&#160;:)
 Illedan: Default is on github yeah
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441627773">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441627773</a>
 JFB: and is only one for each league and have to be?
 Illedan: Default is the same in every league
 Illedan: As you should rather play against a player :P
 JFB: I think it will be nice to have boss of previous league in each league, but if it is diffcul ...
 tutubalin: After update I don't see Pink player marks on timeline
 AntiSquid: wish i promoted when boss was broken lol
 dbdr: I resubbed, way fewer draws&#160;:)
 Illedan: tutubalin, marks are reduced
 Illedan: They spammed too much
 Illedan: Now you only see when lives are lost
 Illedan: Hope it is enough
 emh: ok submitted. praying. hehe
 dbdr: 0-0 draw with egaetan&#160;:)
 tutubalin: what about having different colors for actions and life lost?
 Illedan: The viewer didn't like all those tooltips. Got slow&#160;:/
 Illedan: Let us know on the forum or discord if you want it back and we will see what we can do about it&#160;:)
 tutubalin: then what about Options?sometimes it's good to see actions even for the cost of some slowness
 Illedan: I don't think we can opt it in :thinking:
 Illedan: I'll investigate
 dbdr: coordinates tooltips are still there, which is good
 Illedan: Might break everything to add an option
 egaetan: Illedan &amp; emh subitting why didn't i check before submitting too
 LH: I really like the changes so far. Also having a lot of fun with the contest :grinning:
 735487: sorry guys but I really dislike updates for contest. for me more important was to see on a timeline when i shot then now who lost a life
 Lks10: you can scroll through replay and check bottom of the screen or torpedo commands
 Lks10: *for
 Illedan: The best way for me to track a replay is the scroll it fast and look at the CHARGES
 Illedan: amurushkin, let me know what you think on the Forum and we might add some back if people wants it
 Illedan: Might be it was better
 Uljahn: could be helpful to add to a tooltip a cause of why life has been lost like surface/torpedo/mine
 Illedan: Easy to fix, but let us know
 emh: phew
 emh: still in my place
 egaetan: grrr
 JFB: emv - start surface every 50 mmoves as default boss&#160;;-)
 emh: JFB might be an idea to think about surfacing when there is little navigation room. but don't have a specific idea for a strategy
 735487: I will try to use it more but at the moment i missed the points when i was shoot a torpedo. was helpfull to me before
 Illedan: Thanks for the feedback. I'll bring it up for discussion&#160;:)
 emh: ahh Bronze is getting too crowded. rush to Silver
 emh: hmm.. I guess one of next steps for me would be action search. to plan multiple actions over multiple turns.. but it's a lot of restructuring and not sure how much impact it will have given that we have to wait for charges anyway
 emh: a little finesse in maneuvering in torpedo fights I guess could give some advantage
 Gelucu: what are you guys talking about&#160;? 
 egaetan: Ocean of code
 Gelucu: it already started ^_^ ... i didn't know
 Gelucu: thanks 
 Gelucu: &lt;3
 LaFayette: Silver is open already?
 emh: nope
 emh: wish it was
 735487: Uljahn have a good idea to show the reason why someone lost hp. like Player lost a life by (torpedo, mine, surface)
 Illedan: Added it to our todo&#160;:)
 emh: ok time for a shower
 egaetan: open one window of your submarine
 SarthakSS: hey, when should i use Boost in Coders Strike Back?
 Uljahn: when you find it appropriate
 Tiramon: imho it's not really important, i use it in first round to get up to speed
 SarthakSS: thats what i'm asking, what could be an ideal approach?
 Uljahn: at the first turn or when the distance is large enough
 Tiramon: not right before a 180° turn
 Uljahn: yep
 Tiramon: or any bigger turn needed
 Tiramon: and yes distance ist also impoortant if you are rotated to the target , but it is only 100 pixel away .. might not be the best idea
 Secundus: can you shoot a torpedo at a cell next to you? 
 mchl12: Secundus Yes! You can even shoot a torpedo right where you currently are.
 darkhorse64: Yes, you can shoot yourself
 egaetan: is that really a good idea&#160;?
 Secundus: if the opponent is there, then maybe.
 Illedan: Shooting yourself is very strong
 Lks10: ^
 Illedan: But you need to do it right.
 Illedan: And that is a Legend level tactic
 wlesavo: you can fake your position by shooting yourself simultaneously with your opponent action i guess
 Secundus: you overthink it, im bad at this and im just trying to hit the opponent, no matter the cost. xD
 Lks10: I respect that
 OmidSafari: hi
 OmidSafari: how ar u?
 yfprojects: Hi
 yfprojects: @wlesavo Dont you think that bot programmers wont fall to that trick?
 wlesavo: yfprojects it could be effective against some bots, shouldn't be effective in general, but who knows
 AntiSquid: you get opponent hp as input, how does shooting yourself help?
 emh: Illedan looks like a good submit. what changed?
 Illedan: Just added a ninja hack to use Silence for longer distances if I'm in trouble
 emh: oh ok
 yfprojects: @Illedan why do you think shooting yourself is sttrong?
 Illedan: If the opponent shot a Torpedo or Triggered a mine and your potential positions contains those and you firing at the nearly the same location. He can't know for sure where you were. But it's very hard to perform it correctly. As all the parameters must be correct  :P
 egaetan: lol
 yfprojects: I see. You are right, its quite powerfull.
 dbdr: next meta: set things up to make your opponent shoot themselves
 Illedan: xD
 dbdr: basically push them to suicide
 Illedan: Shot at yourself, drop a mine, use surface, Silence away. 
 dbdr: this is going to be fun
 Illedan: Sending MSG to them to make the bot depressed? :P
 dbdr: MSG Automaton2000 is better than you
 Automaton2000: eulerschezahl do you have in mind?
 AntiSquid: is kostyantynsuschyk in wood1 stuck&#160;?
 dbdr: AntiSquid: yes, for 2 days&#160;:/
 Illedan: He needs to resubmit with the fix of the crashing bug.
 dbdr: referee timeout and CG does not handle it well it seems
 dbdr: CG should also fix the  bug on their side
 Illedan: Yeah, should rather do something with the replay&#160;:(
 uop: coronavirus
 MadKnight: Automaton2000nus
 Automaton2000: no, i don't like the idea of a good way to learn
 MadKnight: do u only accept the bad way to learn, Automaton2000nus&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i have 1 or 2&#160;?
 MadKnight: what's your rank dbdr&#160;?
 MadKnight: did u change your avatar just for this contest dbdr&#160;?
 dbdr: #10
 dbdr: yes, I often do
 dbdr: will you write a bot MadKnight?
 MadKnight: yea probably
 dbdr: gogogo
 tonowak: had anyone some luck with running the referee? I did mvn package, but the resulting jar has "no main manifest attribute". (I don't know a thing about Java)
 Schneewittchen: Same problem here
 Schneewittchen: You are not alone
 tonowak: probably the src/test/java/Main.java isn't being included in the pom?
 Schneewittchen: I think the whole gameEngine-part is missing, but I dont know if this IS requiered
 Schneewittchen: Like in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/fala13/UnleashTheGeek/tree/master/src/main/java/com/codingame">https://github.com/fala13/UnleashTheGeek/tree/master/src/main/java/com/codingame</a>
 tonowak: I think you are right (but with my Java knowledge, I can only guess)
 wlesavo: you need to import it as marven project into eclipse
 blasterpoard: imho making your own referee is worth it in a month-long contest
 blasterpoard: if only to make selfplay faster
 wlesavo: basically here is all you need to run it, although a custom simulation would be much more effective <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game</a>
 Torist: fu
 tonowak: but then, how do I make a custom simulation? I need to work with piping the input/output?
 tonowak: do I have to use eclipse/intellij to setup the referee? Can I do it with the commandline (linux)?
 blasterpoard: tonowak just include it in your bot
 tonowak: yeah but then I have to use its function instead of stdin/stdout, right?
 blasterpoard: yes, and use an #ifdef to decide whether it selfplays or takes input from stdin
 tonowak: that's ugly, I'm sure there is a better way :P
 dbdr: tonowak it's always possible on the command line
 blasterpoard: tonowak I typically have something likethis in my bot:
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/rowogisaju.cpp">https://hastebin.com/rowogisaju.cpp</a>
 dbdr: Illedan allow the bots vote to decide if they want the Actions in the timeline
 blasterpoard: makes it a bit less ugly
 Illedan: Might be a good idea. But you might want to view the enemy commands too :thinking:
 dbdr: I was kind of joking. but who knows&#160;:)
 dbdr: that's why I said vote. if both agree, print both
 dbdr: or if one wants it, print both
 Illedan: I guess that would have to be an extra action :P
 dbdr: or a special message
 Illedan: Or I can check if the MSG ever contains that request
 dbdr: hacking the API
 Illedan: :P
 tonowak: blasterpoard I see. Though, I'm still searching a way to run this official referee...
 dbdr: when the API is frozen, abuse the existing one to do new things
 Illedan: I'll give you a command to let you control the Linux box
 Illedan: Did you add bots in the Main.java tonowak?
 dbdr: :smiling_imp:
 tonowak: my problem is the "no main manifest attribute"
 Illedan: :shrug:
 dbdr: MSG SUDO rm /tmp/Answer.java
 tonowak: so probably the test/Main.java is not included through the mvn package command?
 Illedan: It is part of the project
 dbdr: tonowak I think you need to get the classpath and call the class you want
 Illedan: src/main/test/java/main
 dbdr: no expect the jar to have it
 dbdr: to have the main in the manifest I mean
 tonowak: I think I understand what you mean, but I'm a noob in the Java world
 tonowak: what I did to this point: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/915cf464-cbac-4b04-bcda-628f9aa77e81">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/915cf464-cbac-4b04-bcda-628f9aa77e81</a>
 emh: in 174 replays I got 406 SILENCE with 1 length, 336 with 0 length, 42 with 4 length, 26 with 3 length and 24 with 2 length by opponents
 emh: command:
 emh: grep -v '^$' stdin/* | fgrep -v PADDING | grep -o 'SILENCE [NEWS] [0-9]' | cut -f3 -d" " | sort | uniq -c | sort -g
 dbdr: tonowak right. i'm suggesting not to use java -jar
 jacek: kree java!
 dbdr: but java Main
 Illedan: nice emh
 dbdr: and you need export CLASSPATH=...
 emh: and NORTH is twice as popular as the 3 other directions hehe
 dbdr: tonowak <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16655010/in-maven-how-output-the-classpath-being-used">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16655010/in-maven-how-output-the-classpath-being-used</a>
 Illedan: :D
 emh: although that is because people generally use N with 0
 dbdr: interesting emh
 dbdr: can you graph this stat over time?&#160;;)
 emh: hehe.. too much work
 dbdr: I expect &gt;1 to gorw a bit
 dbdr: jk
 Illedan: Same
 Illedan: I think many are hardcoded now
 Illedan: 1 instead of move
 dbdr: :innocent:
 Illedan: Boss does that&#160;;)
 Illedan: And me :D
 dbdr: guilty as charged
 blasterpoard: trying to figure out the other bots is useless until gold
 dbdr: but fun
 Illedan: Meh, still want to have fun now
 sanfarans: how exactly is the score calculated?
 sanfarans: I mean leaderboards
 blasterpoard: sanfarans a questionable version of TrueSkill
 dbdr: what do you question about it?
 blasterpoard: games only being triggered by submits, mostly
 sanfarans: blasterpoard thanks!
 dbdr: right. that's mitigated contests because of the rerun
 blasterpoard: it can still inflate a boss's rating quite a bit
 dbdr: yeah. boss don't matter in legend&#160;:)
 dbdr: on the other hand players have the advantage of variance
 dbdr: it's enough to be above the boss at one point in time
 dbdr: so it's good that boss is inflated, or too many people would get in by sheer luck
 blasterpoard: I just hope that bosses will be strong, because I don't want a huge gold/legend a couple of days after it opens
 Illedan: Most people stuck in Wood anyhow :D
 blasterpoard: including me&#160;:)
 Illedan: I guess you have a monster anytime soon
 ZarthaxX: did you make hard wood bosses illo?
 wlesavo: wood 1 is easy though
 AntiSquid: only noobs in wood
 blasterpoard: not soon xD
 blasterpoard: eventually
 dbdr: track for strong bosses has been good so far in OOC
 wlesavo: Illedan do you simulate your opponent tracking you?
 Illedan: Ofc
 sanfarans: how many turns can there be in a single game?
 blasterpoard: rn I'm trying to find a good way to evaluate how much information an action gives to the other player...
 wlesavo: also Illedan, how draws are decided?
 Illedan: If both players end the game with an equal amount of life
 Tiramon: not sure if max turns are implemented
 Illedan: 599 sanfarans
 Tiramon: Have more lifes than your enemy after 200 frames.
 wlesavo: Illedan so you trigger gameManager.draw?
 emh: Illedan what do you do with informatiom about how enemy tracks you? I don't even track that
 Tiramon: it is implemented
 Illedan: But there can be more frames as we add frames
 emh: do you silence or escape?
 Illedan: I use it to know when to silence
 emh: ah ok
 sanfarans: how is a frame defined? whats the diffrence between turn and frame?
 Illedan: Or how to much to reduce information given
 Illedan: *how to move
 blasterpoard: is it worth to silence after placing a mine at the start of the game?
 Illedan: Depends..
 blasterpoard: because idk what might be more worth it in the early game than a mine that can't be easily located
 Illedan: We'll see when I start tracking mines
 Schneewittchen: Its basically the same if you silence and place a mine or move and place a mine. You can delete the paths later and come up with the "real" positions of the mines
 <b>**MSmits cries</b></p><p><img src="/a/3252989132290" /> Schneewittchen: *if your opponent
 MSmits: I want a boss that doesn't silence. 
 MSmits: to test code against
 MSmits: wood bosses got nerfed, but I never even got the chance to fight boss of wood 1&#160;:(
 Lks10: nagrarok doesn't silence
 ZarthaxX: they got nerfed?
 Illedan: Slightly
 MSmits: an update just happened
 ZarthaxX: oh sad
 MSmits: silence is a pretty difficult ability to test your tracking against
 MSmits: I want to make sure other stuff is working first
 MSmits: anyone have a reasonably good bot that doesnt silence?
 barbora: try default AI
 MSmits: it silences doesnt it?
 ZarthaxX: use your own bot MSmits
 Lks10: Nagrarok is in 20th place and he doesn't use silence MSmits
 barbora: not very often
 barbora: at least in the games I tried
 MSmits: I guess I could change my own bot to be more useful for testing
 MSmits: or use nagraro
 cegprakash: how are you all
 MSmits: +k
 MSmits: thanks
 cegprakash: ijust logged in to check if ppl are active during quarantine 
 ZarthaxX: there is a contest cegprakash
 cegprakash: just saw.. Ocean of Code right?
 ZarthaxX: 7ye
 ZarthaxX: 1 month
 cegprakash: how is it? fun? am I too late?
 ZarthaxX: no
 ZarthaxX: you got 27 days left
 ZarthaxX: it's cool
 cegprakash: okay I'll start tonight&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: don't like it, but want the CP
 cegprakash: good to spend the lockdown on CG
 MSmits: we dont have a real lockdown here
 AntiSquid: you have a purge instead
 MSmits: we are just *suggested* to keep distance and schools and bars closed
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN taking part in the purge
 AutomatonNN: tbf
 MSmits: I would prefer they keep it that way and instead of a lockdown, mortar shell the beaches to remove the disease vectors
 Lks10: spicy
 ZarthaxX: lockdown here
 MSmits: I have a tiny house and no fitness equipment, I need walks
 AntiSquid: do squats
 AntiSquid: leg stretching etc
 MSmits: also chronic knee issues
 MSmits: i'm just really annoyed that a lockdown may happen just because of dumbasses
 MSmits: if everyone lived like me, there wouldn't even be a corona virus :P
 Lks10: at the very least we can poop for another 10 years
 AntiSquid: got a 3rd phantom foot and feel pain in it?
 MSmits: not that one AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: hm this was supposed to be an improvement @_@ i blame your phantom limb for distracting
 MSmits: :confused:
 AntiSquid: it's ok MSmits i have an extra phantom head
 Tiramon: i know what you mean MSmits, happy we got by now only a 'no contact rule' or however it would be called in english and afaik it at least reduced the people outside
 MSmits: but not enough
 MSmits: we need      :rocket: :beach:
 Tiramon: more than i expected&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: silence changes everything @_@
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: and my messy code doesn't help in that regard
 AntiSquid: but still figuring shit out
 MSmits: still no toilet paper?
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: not that one .
 AntiSquid: excuse my vocabulary
 ZarthaxX: lol you missed squido comment on toilet paper testerday
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: what'd he say
 AntiSquid: even i forgot what i said
 MSmits: maybe it's in your phantom head
 AntiSquid: don't make stuff up ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d75da650-cfc9-464b-be48-81d342b2d4ef">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d75da650-cfc9-464b-be48-81d342b2d4ef</a>
 ZarthaxX: sure&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: true though
 MSmits: ah that defeats the purpose you know. You're supposed to clean your behind
 MSmits: Good warning AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: damn silence gives me headaches , how do i track it Q_Q
 ZarthaxX: he also said this line, which si genius
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid  11:59AMyahard to flush that amount of nonsense down the toilet
 cegprakash: MSmits the only physical activity I do is football and that's ruined now
 AntiSquid: push ups
 cegprakash: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDhCFXs-4Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcDhCFXs-4Q</a>
 MSmits: very informative cegprakash
 ZarthaxX: what a god lol
 AntiSquid: use latex gloves for the "cleaning" hand
 ZarthaxX: Illedan does wood2 boss track enemy?
 cegprakash: that's what we do in India normally :D ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: for real??'
 ZarthaxX: do you have that bath too?
 ZarthaxX: bathroom
 AntiSquid: all bosses track enemy 
 ZarthaxX: confirmed?
 cegprakash: yes no one uses tissues at toilet apart from the 0.01% population 
 AntiSquid: they aren't easy bosses 
 ZarthaxX: oh 
 cegprakash: we use tissues in the offices to clean tables though
 ZarthaxX: is it coz toilet paper costs a lot there or to save the planet
 AntiSquid: uhm . ok 
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid are you kidding or for real?
 AntiSquid: for real lol
 ZarthaxX: aight
 AntiSquid: why do you think there are so many in wood 
 AntiSquid: lol
 ZarthaxX: we joke a lot, cant believe you easily :P
 ZarthaxX: yeah now makes sense
 AntiSquid: that boss tracks you down and wrecks the crap out of you @_@
 ZarthaxX: yeah i noticed lmao
 Uljahn: also shoots itself
 AntiSquid: got to bronze but going further means more pain
 Uljahn: gj squiddo
 ZarthaxX: shoots himself? lol
 AntiSquid: to make it easier
 AntiSquid: also surfaces first turn
 AntiSquid: so you can track it easier
 AntiSquid: but the tracking bit is the hardest
 ZarthaxX: i see
 Uljahn: you can make harder for him to track you by staying away from islands and map borders
 MSmits: I beat him just by tracking him well and shooting torpedo's whenever I can
 Uljahn: i still need to implement shoot+move vs move+shoot choice
 MSmits: me too
 AntiSquid: i forgot about that order complicating things
 wlesavo: well in wood that order does not mattered much
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: just write some tracking code that takes into account islands and map borders and shoot at a random cell the boss might be at
 MSmits: thats all i did
 MSmits: skipped wood 1 with that code as well
 AntiSquid: i am in bronze though
 egaetan: ooops emh
 Illedan: -.-
 wlesavo: MSmits same
 egaetan: :D
 Illedan: Oh, pb4 has joined too&#160;:)
 pb4: damn game is hard -_-
 pb4: Not the kind I'm any good at
 MSmits: pb4 do it like me. Focus less on beating the opponent, but try to write a first class tracking program
 MSmits: enjoy the coding challenge instead
 sanfarans: how to import someone to my testing screen?
 JBM: pay him the big $$$
 pb4: "pb4 do it like me. Focus less on beating the opponent, but try to write a first class tracking program"
 pb4: exactly my approach&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: MSmits you said first class becuase the indian guy said that lol
 JBM: that's always my aproach
 pb4: problem is, you need to get to bronze to test that program :o)
 JBM: that's why i seldom complete contests
 eulerscheZahl: :wave:
 sanfarans: I mean it's possible to import people from last battles screen, but not from leaderboards
 ZarthaxX: hi toad
 sanfarans: and I do not have people I want to import in my last battles

 Insta-x: any tips?
 MSmits: ZarthaxX well spotted
 eulerscheZahl: use mines
 MSmits: very bery well
 tonowak: sanfarans you can delete a player and add another in the IDE

 Insta-x: ok thx
 MindControler: Ur range changes
 Skril: It seems subs are hurt when moving next to a mine, after mine trigger (but on the same round)
 Insta-x: so if we move first, we can shoot further?
 Skril: e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441696000">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441696000</a> on frame 234
 struct: you seem right
 MindControler: That seems like glitch
 eulerscheZahl: interesting replay Skril
 kingofnumbers: are the organizers allowed to participate? :D 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 struct: yes
 MindControler: It shouldnt work like that, right?
 kingofnumbers: is it the same for all future games too? 
 eulerscheZahl: looks like a bug to me Skril, investigating
 Uljahn: are you going to create one?
 Skril: thanks&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: kingofnumbers usually creators can't competebut Illedan and me started 2 days before the official release. no real advantage.
 Illedan: Thx Skril
 darkhorse64: I have seen replays where the opponent does a single SILENCE direction 0, which results in a no move and not dying. Can we SILENCE also through blocked squares&#160;?
 Insta-x: we cant silence through island or our path. at least that is what written on the official rule of captain sonar 
 struct: no darkhorse64
 Insta-x: the real game i meant
 struct: you cant go over squares that were visited before
 struct: even with silence
 AntiSquid: i thought silent submarines can walk on land
 darkhorse64: Only those that have legs
 darkhorse64: I know that since I was a child

 JBM: oh nice it only displays *****
 JBM: i didn't know xmpp could do that
 Scarfield: of course, since its my "real" password :p
 dbdr: ujfdklt
 dbdr: does it work for my password too?
 JBM: depends
 JBM: was your password *******?
 dbdr: no! so it works!
 eulerscheZahl: caution, dbdr saves chat history now
 Scarfield: not my password, but an Archer reference though
 dbdr: Automaton2000 saves it too
 JBM: it's only saved as **** as well! what a great feature!
 Automaton2000: that's the referee bug: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/codingamecommunity/ocean-of-code/commit/562ee7ab052c5c9686ffe2ab6cce181a063da936">https://github.com/codingamecommunity/ocean-of-code/commit/562ee7ab052c5c9686ffe2ab6cce181a063da936</a>

 Schneewittchen: what
 Tiramon: ok testcases for normal movement - donetestcase for silence - tbd
 eulerscheZahl: you said something about graphics iirc

 Scarfield: also this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441064310">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441064310</a>
 MindControler: Wow
 Insta-x: why the ai surface at the start of the game? is it a good strategy?
 struct: its just to help you
 struct: to give you a better chance to win
 MindControler: He cant move
 Insta-x: oo i see
 Scarfield: no, it gives away its position sector
 MindControler: Oh ai
 Insta-x: no he can move, he surface at the first turn
 MindControler: Is just stupid
 MindControler: Its almost random
 Insta-x: is it just me or the ai in the bronze could track too?
 Tiramon: MindControler being locked between ilands can only result in draw or win ... can be worse
 Scarfield: sure the wood bosses where tough, but they got nerfed sometime today
 eulerscheZahl: the bosses and default AI are tracking you Insta-x
 Insta-x: oo, ok
 eulerscheZahl: nerf = they surface every 50 turns now
 Scarfield: the default AI also shoots itself, i havent seen that as much before today? maybe just a lucky match
 eulerscheZahl: always happened
 Insta-x: is there a complete list of the nerf?
 eulerscheZahl: i was aware of that before the contest start but decided to keep it
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441714280">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441714280</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the bosses aren't public, so there is no list. but it's only the surface every 50 turns
 Insta-x: ok thx
 eulerscheZahl: apart from that the boss is unchanged
 Scarfield: i didnt even get to shoot at him :p
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/tyUswJR">https://imgur.com/a/tyUswJR</a>i hate it when this happens
 Scarfield: havent seen that before
 eulerscheZahl: hm, maybe if i turn off the hardware acceleration? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i have that quite often
 Illedan: Never seen that&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: not limited to the current contest for me

 eulerscheZahl: Life reduced and actions (without MOVE)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: give me updates on the COV-19 from your country, my peeps here locally are VERY curious
 Tiramon: hm silence works as planed ... why does my bot not track my enemy correctly ...
 tonowak: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/search?q=System.err&amp;type=">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/search?q=System.err&amp;type=</a>that's ugly :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is mcdonalds closing in uk?
 Astrobytes: yep
 Astrobytes: All non-essential businesses/shops are set to close
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the UK is taking actions now?
 Astrobytes: I believe we'll be under full lockdown in a few days, since nobody takes the social distancing enough seriously 
 Astrobytes: *well, a lot of people
 Insta-x: In Indonesia, we students were told to stay and study at home
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Next county over (Orlando,Fl.) is under curfew ... National Guard is positioning for fulll lockdown
 Insta-x: so.. Online schools
 Scarfield: In DK the police gives fines of about 200Eur if they catch people gathering in crowds
 AntiSquid: UK it's 1000 for those who show symptoms and don't self isolate
 AntiSquid: well with the exception of shopping apparently
 Insta-x: is there any penalty if we submit the code too many times?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Insta-x just schools?
 AntiSquid: yes there is Insta-x
 AntiSquid: you have to fill out a captcha at some point
 AntiSquid: and it gets more and more irritating
 Insta-x: i dont rlly know, but i think the offices are still open. so workers still go to work
 AntiSquid: and the number of images you need to identify keeps increasing
 Insta-x: ok, so how many is to many?
 AntiSquid: so just take a few short breaks inbetween to avoid the annoyance
 AntiSquid: idk, i forgot
 AntiSquid: but i tend to sometimes keep spamming submits
 Insta-x: so the penalty is only the captcha?
 AntiSquid: but that's about it, you're just forced to do captcha
 Insta-x: ok thx, good info haha
 AntiSquid: not a laughing matter, it's punishing enough ... very distracting too
 Insta-x: cuz i want to submit and im afraid i have submitted too many times today
 AntiSquid: just pace your submits
 Insta-x: hmm, yeah, sometimes captcha is annoying
 Insta-x: ok thx
 AntiSquid: don't make too many consecutive ones and you should be fine
 AntiSquid: for example if you keep submitting while it's incomplete, at &lt; 100% then you are very likely to get it
 Insta-x: ok
 Tiramon: eulerscheZahl is it on purpose that islands can seperate 2 players so they can't reach each other?
 Tiramon: it can only result in a draw/suicide
 Insta-x: if islands can seperate 2 players, then the one with more open spaces win
 Illedan: Yeah
 Insta-x: ii think
 struct: Is it possible to happen though?
 struct: I mean spliting map in big regions

 Nixerrr: I feel like an old dude. Had to google "to nerf"
 wlesavo: so how old are you?
 eulerscheZahl: i learned that word on CG too
 eulerscheZahl: at botg i think
 Nixerrr: Ok I feel a little better now
 Nixerrr: wlesavo not as old as elderlybeginner but probably older than most peeps here
 Astrobytes: :older_man:

 AntiSquid: geez
 Illedan: Bug in the viewer. Will be fixed in the next update, which is pending.
 AntiSquid: the branching factor is ridiculous
 egaetan: ridiculous low or high&#160;?
 dror1212: can you move and silence move on the same turn?
 AntiSquid: high with silence
 yfprojects: Its lower than times 13
 AntiSquid: yes you can dror1212
 yfprojects: and it has a limit
 AntiSquid: i don't get your point, are you trying to argue something regarding the branching factor?
 AntiSquid: yfprojects
 yfprojects: i am just asking if thats too high for you, if we have th same basis
 AntiSquid: what basis do you have? for what?
 yfprojects: basis of information
 yfprojects: or do you say that different in English?
 AntiSquid: alright, i don't understand what you are on about, so i'll just leave it be
 yfprojects: yeah, lets leave it be.

 reCurse: ...
 emh: ah deep sea crustaceans for supper. fished by my father. not from sub. but seems fitting&#160;:)
 reCurse: Don't be bigoted
 Astrobytes: And I had to get an old schoolfriend (who I haven't seen for 20 years) to drop some food into my Grandad, since we have nobody to feed him now
 Astrobytes: Yeah ZarthaxX, fix your racism
 Illedan: Yeah, I know dbdr. The UI and the game logic was mixed together and I regret not fixing that at once when I got the code :PSo some UI changes happens at once on your turn and then the move sequentially
 ZarthaxX: i said that just because it started there
 ZarthaxX: dont hate them really
 ZarthaxX: sorry reCurse
 dbdr: Illedan yeah,  that's it
 AntiSquid: a lot of innocent chinese died and it fucked up their economy too 
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes that's a shitty situation&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: yeah well it's a hate against their government
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX, yeah, I'm not the only person in this kind of situation sadly
 ZarthaxX: i have my grandma with us, we have to be cautious
 ZarthaxX: annoying to clean everything without knowing where that virus is
 MSmits: hmm there's a lot to hate about the Chinese government, but the way they handled this crisis actually reduced the problem
 ZarthaxX: not in the start
 AntiSquid: a doctor had to die, or was it two?
 MSmits: of course there's also the million people in concentration camps and women being sterilized to perform genocide. I'd worry about that first
 ZarthaxX: the first doctor that knew about the virus died
 eulerscheZahl: story for conspiracy theoriesyou start
 MSmits: if you're referring to what I just said, it's not a conspiracy theory
 MSmits: quite well documented
 Nixerrr: I thin
 eulerscheZahl: not what i meant
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, I fully agree
 Nixerrr: *I think he said that Zart
 MSmits: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: that appeared somewhere
 ZarthaxX: it's not a big conspiracy theory jsut a death lol
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm sure you can write a conspiracy theory around it
 MSmits: whats weird is that this doctor died when it's super rare for people to die at that age
 ZarthaxX: ok forget it lol
 MSmits: from corona that is
 MSmits: our youngest is now 55 I think
 ZarthaxX: there are cases of young ppl dying..
 MSmits: not here yet
 struct: soon china reads this chat and takes CG down and no contest for anyone
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: they can do it if they want to
 ZarthaxX: ok back to contest

 reCurse: You picked the right one
 eulerscheZahl: not my choice but i totally agree
 Astrobytes: That one would have infuriated Maddy and Squid, and probably caused a Discord flame war, and potentially a blog article from Thibaud :P
 MSmits: why?
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Is it too late to change my opinion now
 reCurse: Can't say no to free entertainment
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: feminism MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: only if inoryy joins the fight
 MSmits: why is it feminisn if the sailors hired a stripper for the sub
 MSmits: also, why is it feminism if the captain is a girl
 MSmits: shoulda led with that
 reCurse: Oh maybe we can still get a trainwreck :popcorn:
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: what do you mean Astrobytes
 MSmits: :train:
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: i don't see why i'd get angry at that picture
 MSmits: maybe think about it a little longer. Don't dismiss it just yet AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: kinda prefer that one actually, but maybe others wouldn't like it
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: but i like that one better MSmits @_@
 MSmits: yeah i dont mind either way
 MSmits: is it like 60s style?
 MSmits: looks pretty old style
 AntiSquid: i also don't see the relation to feminism in that one
 reCurse: There's always a relation
 reCurse: You just don't try hard enough
 AntiSquid: and i mean the extremist ones at least
 Nixerrr: I could find multiple angles
 MSmits: feminism is poorly defined these days
 reCurse: You can start with buzzwords like objectification and patriarchy, the rest should write itself
 AntiSquid: nah i think feminists would hate that pic since it looks like what they suspect to be a "stereotypical woman" 
 reCurse: There you go
 MSmits: whats a stereotypical woman anyway
 reCurse: I knew you could do it
 AntiSquid: one that doesn't make men look the other way MSmits
 MSmits: which way were they looking before?
 Waffle3z: stereotypical looking women can't operate parascopes?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "The Hunt for good Man meat"
 Nixerrr: parascope? :O
 reCurse: It's something to stay hidden from scopes
 Waffle3z: periscope
 reCurse: Learn english
 AntiSquid: alright, how about the cover gets changed to that and then we get an opinion poll from some feminism elite members?
 Nixerrr: beyond scope
 reCurse: Change the cover to that, post a link to it and wondev woman to jezebel and we're guaranteed to hit 10k participants
 emh: lexical scope, lexi belle scope
 Astrobytes: lol, nice to kick the wasp nest once in a while :P

 Tiramon: and fire my torpedo when i exactly know his location and he is in range

 eulerscheZahl: try shooting when the opponent possibly is in range and then deduct if he was
 AntiSquid: ya ^

 AntiSquid: fully working tracking? :o
 Tiramon: that's the next step eulerscheZahl, but i don't wan't to shot to early because it will also show where i am

 AntiSquid: i might still have plenty bugs, but 100% 60 would be too high once i fix them
 Tiramon: oh found another peek in that replay Enemy Path 9790
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr 08:57PMeulerscheZahl the update was right now, with the action order fix?yes
 ygricks: how to use sonar&#160;? wood 2, I still don't understand how to find the eneny
 dbdr: great, thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: and reload UI changed for colorblind users
 dbdr: let's see...
 eulerscheZahl: and credit to illedan
 eulerscheZahl: how broke it before :imp:
 ZarthaxX: ygricks no sonar in wood2
 dbdr: thanks Illedan!
 ZarthaxX: it's in wood1
 eulerscheZahl: who*
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: those who work much cause many bugs
 eulerscheZahl: i don't make bugs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ygricks enemy move history is a good indication, second is detecting direct and indirect hits, then maybe surface sector, then maybe enemy torped in his range (or did he?)
 Astrobytes: "reload UI changed for colorblind users" - thank you very much!
 mchl12: Thanks for the update, although I can no longer blame the game for losing a match.
 Tiramon: so one of pb's silence multiplies the amount of possible path by around 10 .. so the frame i timeout it would result in around 50k possible path ... omg
 ygricks: thanks, at start I thought it will be easier, big thanks
 Tiramon: damn 928 possible path for 15 end locations ...
 dbdr: hello silence my old friend
 eulerscheZahl: it's darkness, quote your dexter right
 dbdr: dexter?
 kovi: this a sound of darkness
 dbdr: it's simon and garfunkel
 AntiSquid: i just wonder why i don't time out from the sheer amount of for loops 
 dbdr: what is dexter?
 Astrobytes: Cartoon dbdr
 AntiSquid: dexter from breaking bad?
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, the serial killer Dexter?
 Astrobytes: I only know it from S &amp; G
 Tiramon: hm i could reduce the amount of path on surface ... which would be an improvment ... but pb doesn't surface before i timeout&#160;;)
 Waffle3z: what's the pb test? did I pass? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441776500">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441776500</a>

 Zenoscave: did I pass?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: but i win in 87&#160;! :p
 eulerscheZahl: you probably failed, if the output is the possible states
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441777332">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441777332</a>
 dbdr: 87 as well
 Zenoscave: What is this test
 AntiSquid: idk
 struct: the test is to see possible states
 AntiSquid: some euler test
 eulerscheZahl: high branching
 struct: to calculate
 struct: not just play the code
 AntiSquid: you need to take the test to get euler stamp of approval
 dbdr: 200 players in bronze
 eulerscheZahl: so few
 Waffle3z: currently failing the egaetan test
 dbdr: quality not quantity
 kovi: 201 soon
 eulerscheZahl: you?
 AntiSquid: barely 700 joined
 kovi: it seems
 eulerscheZahl: it's your 1st contest Waffle3z :o
 AntiSquid: what's the egaetan test?
 eulerscheZahl: were you a member already at utg?
 Waffle3z: no
 Waffle3z: somebody showed me clash of code and I beat it and there was never a contest since
 eulerscheZahl: do you like it so far?
 kovi: almost flowless run
 Zenoscave: Do you pass if you get it in 87&#160;? I don't get this test
 eulerscheZahl: not just the game, the community + crowded chat and all
 kovi: flawless
 AntiSquid: zeno it's about winning without timing out from predicting the opponent's possible locations
 AntiSquid: that's all
 AntiSquid: was just randomly bragging with the 87, ignore it
 Waffle3z: yeah I was doing bot stuff and adventofcode before I found this
 Zenoscave: ohhhhh ok
 Waffle3z: this contest is hard, I wonder how small further leagues are going to be since it feels like it already slowed down
 struct: euler run test against him on this seed
 struct: seed=6419651854651190300
 tonowak: I really like the idea of this pb test :P
 tonowak: eulerscheZahl why aren't you higher in the leaderboard?
 AntiSquid: best test for me is increasing win&#160;% vs egaetan

 Waffle3z: egaetan broke my tracking by directly shooting himself with a torpedo, I somehow end up with 0 possible locations <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441778008">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441778008</a>
 struct: new candidate
 eulerscheZahl: right now i'm not playing tonowak
 eulerscheZahl: 4 weeks is too long for my taste
 eulerscheZahl: i'll join later
 tonowak: ok :P
 eulerscheZahl: my arena bot is just half a day of writing a tracker and a bit of logic to use it
 eulerscheZahl: i use random to decide what to charge
 Zenoscave: my tracker must be missing something
 eulerscheZahl: do you consider all possibilities on SILENCE? 0-4 move length
 Zenoscave: yes
 Zenoscave: should I filter them better
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: you have less possible paths than i would expect
 AntiSquid: maybe it's about tracking the entirety of the paths?
 dbdr: depends if you count paths or positions
 kovi: hmm
 kovi: how can you do 0 cell silence?
 Waffle3z: SILENCE N 0
 kovi: i mean than you visit the same cell you are on
 Tiramon: only with a path you can be sure of the results of a silence
 Zenoscave: Oh you count each full path?
 egaetan: AntiSquid&#160;? Waffle3z&#160;?
 dbdr: not moving is not a  visit
 AntiSquid: yes? 
 AntiSquid: how may i help&#160;?
 kovi: but you did visit it last turn
 eulerscheZahl: yes Zenoscave
 kovi: am i missing something?
 eulerscheZahl: that's why it's exploding in size
 Tiramon: my peak is Enemy Path 9790 in frame 61
 Zenoscave: Will fix now
 dbdr: kovi it's just a definition
 AntiSquid: i think it's like shooting torpedo and not moving kovi
 dbdr: if you say there it's a single visit
 dbdr: stay there
 kovi: oh, ok. i c
 Waffle3z: looks like I forgot to remove mines from my grid of mine positions after I trigger them
 dbdr: reusable mines
 Waffle3z: tried to trigger the same mine twice and ended up with 0 possible positions after it didn't hit the second time
 egaetan: what is this pb4 test&#160;?
 Waffle3z: play against pb4, who only uses silence, and don't crash
 struct: seed=6419651854651190300
 Tiramon: tracing all path against him on seed=2159784252580095740
 struct: or the other that euler posted before
 struct: I think the 641 has more paths
 egaetan: pb4 craches long before me
 egaetan: is ther any special seed&#160;?
 struct: one of those
 dbdr: nice promotion kovi
 eulerscheZahl: and don't SONAR or attack
 Waffle3z: I only track positions and not whole paths so I don't time out
 kovi: thx dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: but your tracking is less accurate Waffle3z
 Tiramon: at least i timeout earlier on that seed struct&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: same Tiramon
 Waffle3z: what am I missing
 Tiramon: frame 61
 egaetan: seed  2159784252580095740 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441783046">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441783046</a>
 eulerscheZahl: frame 58
 eulerscheZahl: egaetan no mines
 Waffle3z: oh by recording paths I can deduce some visited cells and rule out silence branches
 Tiramon: but you will timeout sometimes&#160;;)
 egaetan: eulerscheZahl should i fire torped on him&#160;?
 struct: no
 struct: dont use anything that helps tracking him
 eulerscheZahl: be peaceful, just observe
 AntiSquid: lol annoying test, forgot to turn on torpedoes after i turned them off :D
 Tiramon: no sonar no torpedo or mine
 AntiSquid: i checked every all my tracking code, quite sure i do nothing wrong, i still win, but i don't save massive chains of path trees
 Illedan: :wave: 
 egaetan: he timeout at turn 87&#160;? on seed=2159784252580095740
 AntiSquid: same ^
 eulerscheZahl: if you reach 87, you win
 eulerscheZahl: 124k paths
 Tiramon: ok ... i think i found a solution to to better
 Illedan: I guess he uses his bot for testing
 struct: the objective is for you to timeout, by calculating all his paths
 pb4: I can hardcode further if you want
 Illedan: :D
 struct: pb4 hardcode for this seed maybe? seed=6419651854651190300
 struct: or if you find a better one 
 egaetan: eulerscheZahl does somebody really has the 124k path&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 pb4: struct&#160;: I timeout on your seed&#160;:(
 Illedan: tracking yourself?
 pb4: tracking the hardcoded pb4 on the leaderboard
 Illedan: aha
 eulerscheZahl: where am i? i accidentally replaced the inputs from the referee
 pb4: How far do you all go on struct's seed seed=6419651854651190300&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 58
 struct: Tiramo n said 61
 Illedan: 58 what?
 struct: until turn 58 Illedan

 Illedan: When you can kill him?
 pb4: nice dbdr&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: no mines, torpedoes, sonar
 AntiSquid: winning the egaetan test:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441785815">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441785815</a> (you time out just to let you know, would appreciate if you return the favor)

 egaetan: thx AntiSquid, i already know, around 1/40 game i timout on first turn&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you don't track full paths Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: your bot doesn't qualify for the test
 Illedan: Oh, until you timeout
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Not pb4
 AntiSquid: you used sonar&#160;! supposed not to
 eulerscheZahl: you are supposed to analyze all possible locations with history
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: how many possible enemy positions at the end of the test&#160;? (both seeds)
 Tiramon: ok so i optimized my tracking, but i timout earlier ... damn
 AntiSquid: maybe precise tracking is a trap and not the answer?
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan also blew up mines
 egaetan: seed 6419651854651190300  .. 300 too
 egaetan: 58
 AntiSquid: how can opponent's TRIGGER command be useful to gain info?
 eulerscheZahl: placed a mine there in the past
 AntiSquid: so that's where you need full path&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and right now the opponent is or is not in the blast range
 Waffle3z: so much information, so little time and space to fully integrate it all
 eulerscheZahl: full path is needed because of not crossing the own path
 eulerscheZahl: you can't silence through your own path, so that reduces options
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: hardest game on CG?
 OmidSafari: hi
 OmidSafari: how ar u?
 AntiSquid: amazing, thanks for asking
 emh: I'm looking for a magic torpedo. easy to code. easy to win. who can help?
 AntiSquid: and how are you sir? OmidSafari
 tonowak: good, and you?
 Astrobytes: emh Lexi Belle
 OmidSafari: thanks a lot
 emh: Astrobytes ok thx I will submerge her
 tonowak: I somehow cannot run the struct seed on the pb4 test. It shows me a different map, even though I put the seed in the "manual" box
 stormKx18: eulerscheZahl - it would be nice to be able to destroy enemy mines with a torpedo
 stormKx18: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441789375">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441789375</a>
 Astrobytes: :D
 stormKx18: frame 150
 j0: can u guys give me a hint how to track an opponent
 Illedan: that is very game breaking :P
 eulerscheZahl: it was a design choice not to trigger mines by torpedoes or other mines
 egaetan: tonowak weird
 eulerscheZahl: following the rules of the original game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.matagot.com/IMG/pdf/SONAR_RULES_EN_lr.pdf">https://www.matagot.com/IMG/pdf/SONAR_RULES_EN_lr.pdf</a>
 tonowak: or maybe you guys showed replays with another seed
 Tiramon: did you click 'replay in same conditions' tonowak that happened to me
 eulerscheZahl: same conditions undoes whatever you did
 tonowak: could someone show a replay of a map with this seed? I would then know if something is wrong
 egaetan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441790926">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441790926</a> seed=6419651854651190300
 egaetan: eulerscheZahl how many path before turn 58&#160;?
 tonowak: I get a different map. Even though I just refreshed the page (thus, there was no "replay in same condition" button)
 Tiramon: hm my result of locations  differs from the one egaeton just posted ...
 eulerscheZahl: egaetan check my output <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441792023">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441792023</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it's final nodes and total paths
 eulerscheZahl: not in that order
 Tiramon: oh no just watched wrong frame ...
 pb4: same value for me
 Illedan: Breaking my bot now if anyone wants to grab the latest working before it's gone :P
 Tiramon: for me it's 59 not 58
 egaetan: eulerscheZahl i have different numbers
 eulerscheZahl: we have you in the latest battles Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: can grab from there
 Illedan: Alright, only moving + silence submitted.
 pb4: what numbers egaetan&#160;?
 pb4: Illedan&#160;: why&#160;?
 egaetan: number of path at end of turn turn 57
 Illedan: I'm working on a new bot. And I need this one to test with
 Illedan: And I keep losing focus because I'm ranked too high..
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Illedan: Better to stay all the way down here
 Tiramon: poor Illedan&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that's how i learned linux
 tonowak: could someone explain to me how to get this map? I'm doing the following steps: select pb4 from the players as player2, click on options, manual and paste the struct seed. Then play my code. I get a different map than you guys get
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: delete windows
 Illedan: tonowak, you need to enable expert mode
 pb4: tonowak&#160;: seems correct&#160;:/
 Illedan: Go to settings
 tonowak:&#160;???
 Illedan: and click MODE
 Illedan: Then go to options above the players
 tonowak: I have EXPERT selected
 Illedan: and swap the seed
 struct: paste what you are pasting in IDE here
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/rlgki9">https://prnt.sc/rlgki9</a>
 tonowak: 6419651854651190300
 pb4: do you write seed=xxxxxxxx&#160;?
 pb4: or just xxxxx&#160;?
 struct: seed=6419651854651190300
 tonowak: huh
 struct: must be that
 pb4: You need seed=xxxxx
 tonowak: that's... stupid
 tonowak: thanks!
 struct: in some games, you can put more stuff than the seed
 tonowak: yeah, it works now! :D
 eulerscheZahl: in theory you can pass more options if the referee supports it
 struct: thats why you need to mention
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. the map size for vindinium
 struct: 10 pods for CSB
 Tiramon: eulerscheZahl i didn't get more frames than you i just had my own silence still activated
 eulerscheZahl: silence is allowed
 eulerscheZahl: oh, frame&#160;!= turn
 Tiramon: right
 eulerscheZahl: i silence too :o
 Tiramon: hm i silence and move in the same turn ...
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i only do 1 at a time
 egaetan: so how many is the correct number at turn 57&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: for my bot silence = move with string replace
 egaetan: eulerscheZahl we start differing at turn 30
 eulerscheZahl: pb gets my numbers too
 egaetan: you've got 41/2064 i've got 41/2024
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you find duplicates there
 eulerscheZahl: which i somehow miss
 egaetan: i deduplicate yes
 egaetan: should be taht
 eulerscheZahl: i should toobut maybe i bugged it
 tonowak: I have the same numbers as eulerscheZahl
 stormKx18: I think the mine-torpedo interactions are not clear in that rule book, other forums show that a torpedo should remove the mine
 stormKx18: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1746263/final-judgement-torpdeo-mine-interaction">https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1746263/final-judgement-torpdeo-mine-interaction</a>
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: you do miss some duplicates
 pb4: but it's faster (in my case) not to deduplicate -_-
 Tiramon: i got the same numbers as you do egaetan
 egaetan: thx Tiramon deduplication win&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: i already hash my paths while extending
 eulerscheZahl: zobrist style
 eulerscheZahl: may future me curse about it
 egaetan: my better deduplication doesn't help with turn 58
 pb4: 41/2024 with deduplication too
 egaetan: :D
 pb4: but deduplication is basically just as long as the full search -_-
 tonowak: though is deduplication better? You lose info that some paths are more probable than others
 egaetan: 49/2671 at turn 57
 egaetan: tonowak i don't loose informations
 Tiramon: and with that silence it should grow to something above 20k path
 tonowak: ok, so you store how many duplicates there are?
 pb4: same egaetan
 tonowak: then that's indeed better :P
 tonowak: though potentially, how much info could you compress? More than 2x?
 eulerscheZahl: not storing amount of duplicates
 tonowak: did anyone survive turn 86?
 Hjax: what are we talking about?
 tonowak: the pb4 test
 Hjax: whats that 
 tonowak: scroll up
 Tiramon: ok no chance to survive frame 58 it takes me 45ms for that silence in fram e44
 Hjax: you guys are trying to calculate the number of possibilities?
 Hjax: for some position in OoC?
 AntiSquid: without timeout
 emh: eulerscheZahl <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441796208">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441796208</a>
 Astrobytes: don't click that, there'll be penile submarines and everything 
 tonowak: I'm timing out at 86, but at 85 I'm spending 0 milliseconds. Something is weird...
 AntiSquid: BAN
 Hjax: whats the point of calculating the entire path and all of the variations? 
 tonowak: prediction of enemy place
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes hAHAHAHA
 AntiSquid: flexing the code Hjax
 struct: RIP all tests
 ZarthaxX: good one
 struct: I have new seed
 struct: seed=1366069953
 Hjax: yeah but you dont need to enumerate all possible enemy paths 
 Hjax: to track your opponent 
 tonowak: yeah but you can
 Hjax: is there a benefit? 
 tonowak: yes. Better enemy place prediction
 Hjax: over just shifting around their possible locations and removing the illegal ones each frame?
 AntiSquid: it helps a bit with elimination of possible positions i think
 Tiramon: yes you can calculate where he didn't walk on silence because path can't cross
 Hjax: oooooooooooooooooh that was the bit i was missing Tiramon
 struct: Tiramon how far on seed=1366069953
 Hjax: i now understand why its useful 
 tonowak: struct I'm timing out at 72
 Illedan: 140th without attacking&#160;:)
 struct: im running the map generator offline to create worst map possible
 AntiSquid: some new leaderboard challenge lol?
 Hjax: seems like i have a lot of catching up to do 
 Hjax: im still in wood XD, been lazy 
 Tiramon: ok guess i'm happy that with deduplication i still get to 58 and got valid results
 tonowak: Illedan but do you have full prediction?
 Illedan: Not at all
 AntiSquid: ya didn't want to waste time fixing my pediction in wood so i added a tiny bit of "strategy" 
 Illedan: Hence I'm submitting a bot without attacking. To fix my prediction
 Hjax: my prediction is not very complete right now 
 stormKx18: Illedan -&gt; rule book page number 6 states that mines should be destrouyed by a torpedo<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.matagot.com/IMG/pdf/SONAR_RULES_EN_lr.pdf">https://www.matagot.com/IMG/pdf/SONAR_RULES_EN_lr.pdf</a>
 Hjax: it doesnt take into account silence or torpedos at all 
 Illedan: Hmm stormKx18, I see it doesn't blow the mine. Just destroys it.
 Hjax: so you guys are forking your predictions whenever the enemy uses silence and updating them separately? 
 stormKx18: but in the current implementation, mines are not destroyed
 AntiSquid: should i care if enemy uses sonar&#160;?
 Illedan: Correct.
 egaetan: tonowak what are your result on 6419651854651190300&#160;?
 tonowak: you mean turns?
 struct: egaetan try this one seed=1366069953
 Illedan: I think making torpedos destroy mines is a very game changing change.
 tonowak: I get 117979 paths on turn 86 on this seed egaetan
 mchl12: An enemy using sonar tells you nothing about their position, but if you are tracking what the opponent knows about your position, you might want pay attention to their sonar.
 stormKx18: at least remove the mines, I think is a good idea to counter the bots that spam mines
 egaetan: ouch tonowak i cant follow you on this
 tonowak: egaetan you mean number of turns?
 egaetan: numbers of turns and paths
 Hjax: is tracking all of their possible paths even that useful? with 100k paths you probably know very little about where your opponent is
 Illedan: Sorry stormKx18. I can't do that kind of change now.
 tonowak: well, I coded it in C++, and it is pretty well optimized
 egaetan: mines are not a problem
 blasterpoard: it wouldn't even be a good idea - removing a mine would give away your position
 tonowak: Hjax in this situation it isn't
 tonowak: but normally the number of paths is not bigger than... 100?
 Illedan: true blasterpoard. And I would have to change the input scheme :scream:
 YannT: Illedan: I have a weird thing on the first turn I can't make sense of
 egaetan: i reach 2000 - 3000 sometimes tonowak
 Illedan: Show me YannT?
 PapaNaxos: my output matches the expect output but codingame says "Expected: Nothing"&#160;??
 YannT: reading the opponent order (which is "NA" on that turn) takes like  30ms
 YannT: out of 50ms, that's a lot
 Illedan: Start you timer after the first input?
 YannT: yep
 YannT: I do get a timeout sometimes because of it
 YannT: and only on the first turn
 YannT: Finished turn in 56ms
 YannT: other turns I'm always under 5ms
 YannT: it's specifically the "NA" input too, reading the rest before that is 0ms
 YannT: but that one is 30ms&#160;:/
 Illedan: Can you create a minimal proff in some language and send me on Discord?
 Illedan: I'll verify or deny it&#160;:)
 YannT: should be possible from the stub easy enough yeah
 Illedan: Thx
 struct: Ok last seed
 struct: seed=51993548
 struct: Now this one should be the less islands you can get lol
 Illedan: Did you find one where the map is split in 2?
 struct: pb4 you might want to try on this one
 struct: Nah illedan
 struct: But I can try and run it offline
 Illedan: seed=1 is far worse..
 YannT: [TIME] Before reading orders: 0ms[TIME] Order read: 25ms[TIME] After reading orders: 26ms
 pb4: even with deduplication there are 27k paths at frame 72
 YannT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fcec035c-c25f-4440-8f06-b98a33aae02f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fcec035c-c25f-4440-8f06-b98a33aae02f</a>
 YannT: minimal reproduce
 tonowak: YannT the referee doesn't measure your time from the moment it gave all the output?
 struct: in that seed?
 YannT: I just measured the time before and after that particular input read anyway
 YannT: it comes to 20ms
 YannT: out of 50ms that's a bunch
 tonowak: without deduplication I have 57083 on frame 72
 Illedan: what lang is this? :P
 YannT: Kotlin :p 
 Illedan: ahh
 Illedan: Thought it was java
 YannT: close enough!
 tonowak: YannT I think that you have 50ms after the referee gave you the whole turn input
 YannT: no from first input read
 YannT: which is where I started the timer
 YannT: anyway you can see it comes in before the read at 0ms, and 20ms after read
 Illedan: yeah, but you are counting enemy player and referee time too?
 YannT: no matter when you start, it arrives at that read at 0ms and comes out of it at 20ms
 YannT: so the operation took 20ms
 YannT: doesn't really matter when you start or no I'm measuring that specific line :p
 tonowak: YannT try something like this: before the end of while loop, sleep for 45 ms
 tonowak: and see if the bot times out in the IDE
 tonowak: that would answer if those spent 20ms are included in the time limit
 YannT: they are,  I sometimes timeout
 tonowak: have you tried exactly this?
 YannT: I wasn't screwing around with timers everywhere for sport :p 
 tonowak: until you give me the code that indeed times out in such way, I won't believe you :P
 YannT: trust me lots of testing went into narrowing this down&#160;;)à
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e45fcf55-bca1-4605-bd02-0c18d5116fcb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e45fcf55-bca1-4605-bd02-0c18d5116fcb</a>
 Illedan: This gives 0ms and 0 ms..
 emh: ooo I start my timer after input read
 emh: didn't seem to have problems with 45ms in that
 YannT: first input read yeah
 emh: last for me
 YannT: Illedan: hm can't argue with that
 stormKx18: Illedan-&gt; thanks for your feedback, the game  is great&#160;:)
 YannT: oh shit found the problem
 YannT: it's the split
 tonowak: what's wrong with the split?
 YannT: must be some JVM thing that it loads on the first split call
 Illedan: :P
 Tiramon: opponentOrders.split("\\|");
 YannT: you put the split call you get +20ms on the first call, it must be classloading something or other
 tonowak: so Illedan I should start my timer in the first int that I scan, not after the last one?
 struct: Illedan does this count?seed=1764530081
 Illedan: after the first you scan yeah
 Illedan: I think
 struct: if you want I do better
 Illedan: It's part of the framework
 tonowak: ty. Good to know
 Tiramon: YannT use split("\\|")
 Illedan: But just read and do work after :P
 Tiramon: else it will split down in singel characters
 Illedan: struct, thx :D
 Illedan: I love that one :D
 YannT: Illedan: fixed it, I made some junk split call before giving the start position so those extra 20ms fall into the 1s delay
 YannT: it is a classloading thing
 Illedan: Good stuff
 tonowak: that's a nice seed you got there struct
 Uljahn: #justwarmupthings
 struct: Im just using referee
 struct: with a few changes
 struct: generate infinite maps until requirement is met&#160;:)
 YannT: Tiramon: nah it works, it's classloading that takes some extra time
 struct: seed=-1881372996
 struct: You might enjoy this one better
 Illedan: damn
 Illedan: even gotta think for this one
 tonowak: so the consequence of the pb4 test is that it won't be possible to do a full deduction on mines, right?
 Illedan: I guess you can do assumptions
 Illedan: But pb4 didn't use 3 rounds now and then to generate mine charges
 Illedan: But if the opponent is hard on the Silence. You can simply use some torpedos and narrow it much faster down
 tonowak: hmm is it a good strategy though?
 Illedan: We'll see
 tonowak: won't the sonar be better in this particular situation?
 Illedan: It's day 4. Haven't done a phd on the game yet :P
 egaetan: you expose yourself with torpedos
 egaetan: sonar should be lot better
 Waffle3z: how long to contests usually last? this one is long?
 Illedan: 10 days normally
 Illedan: Sonar is better, but Torpedo might get you lucky
 Illedan: And if torpedo hit, you can narrow it even more down
 egaetan: sonar is sooooooo long to charge
 Illedan: :P
 tonowak: this strategy could go very bad against a hide &amp; hit&amp;run strategy
 tonowak: the torpedo one
 Hjax: i bet its loading its regex engine 
 Hjax: @YannT
 YannT: yeah it has  to be something like that
 Spifflejedi: hi, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c66be773-217e-4230-a52c-887d07416cea">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c66be773-217e-4230-a52c-887d07416cea</a>
 YannT: no you're not
 YannT: think of it as taking several turns in a row
 YannT: first boom, then  move after boom
 YannT: same for everything
 YannT: (except loading systems by moving btw)
 Spifflejedi: ok then I have a issue in the mng of my coordinates ^^
 tonowak: yeah, and that's why you can first move and charge a torpedo, then fire the (just now) loaded torpedo on the same turn
 YannT: no that doesn't work actually
 YannT: I tried it
 tonowak: then check my bot :P
 YannT: for me it just removed my torpedo cooldown but no fire
 YannT: I took it to mean that was invalid
 tonowak: then you did something wrong. It is clearly working for me
 Tiramon: propably just invalid target
 Tiramon: i also do that
 Tiramon: ah better tracking and better targeting ... this is a much nicer rank
 egaetan: ehh i don't do that!
 tonowak: really egaetan? :O
 egaetan: no never
 Tiramon: then don't start doing
 egaetan: if (maxnb * thresholdShoot &gt; here.size() &amp;&amp; torpedoCooldown == 0 &amp;&amp; maxP&#160;!= null) {
 tonowak: I should better not say anything on the chat :P
 egaetan: i consider torpedo only when cooldown is at 0
 egaetan: I would have found it one day or another
 YannT: are you suuuuure it works to say MOVE  first, charge torpedo to 3/3 and then fire it in one turn?
 egaetan: so another todo
 tonowak: yes YannT
 YannT: ahh lets do that for everyyyything then!
 struct: help
 Spifflejedi: hehe
 struct: now Im stuck looking for seeds
 struct: seed=655556558
 tonowak: ooh that's a nice seed
 tonowak: theoretically, what is the minimum number of island cells?
 tonowak: 6?
 struct: idk
 struct: Im checking
 tonowak: it is 2
 struct: you think?
 tonowak: yeah. The "create random islands", even though it fires at least 5 times, potentially it could lit only one cell in the results table
 tonowak: oh, and if it would be x=14 y=0 then the "increase the island tiles" would do nothing
 tonowak: so the answer is "1"
 tonowak: with a chance of... 1/(26 * 15^10)
 YannT: tonowak: oh yeah that works&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX joined the game :o
 tonowak: so you would have to generate, on average, around 10^13 - 10^14 seeds
 tonowak: I don't think it is computationally feasible
 tonowak: so on average, it is not possible to get only 1 island tile
 tonowak: but 2 island tiles should be practically possible
 tonowak: maybe there is a way to reverse-engineer the seed? But I don't know how the Java rand works
 Illedan: :P
 egaetan: i known someone who knows
 tonowak: yes?
 Illedan: Just copy the referee, remove the map gen and upload a private contribution...@
 struct: trying to find a map with 4 islands
 egaetan: tonowak <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://recursive.cc/blog/bruteforcing-the-seed-in-code4life.html">https://recursive.cc/blog/bruteforcing-the-seed-in-code4life.html</a>
 tonowak: egatean that was some interesting read :P reminds me on how some are able to hack peoples' hashing algorithms on codeforces
 AntiSquid: how many times did you have to rewrite your bots?
 struct:&#160;!!!!
 struct: 4  islands
 JFB: seed=2974831157920180200
 struct: seed=-430391657
 tonowak: nice struct
 Zenoscave: play against egaetan on that map
 AntiSquid: how many different things can you chain&#160;?
 AntiSquid: in output
 Zenoscave: one of each
 tonowak: all of them
 AntiSquid: ok
 GetSchwifty: wait, you can move after using silence?
 tonowak: yes
 Zenoscave: yup
 GetSchwifty: fml
 AntiSquid: yes lots of odd combinations in whichever order you want
 AntiSquid: confused what to do next with the overwhelming possibilities
 GetSchwifty: don't forget MSG
 AntiSquid: msg always at the end no&#160;?:p
 tonowak: MOVE | SURFACE | TORPEDO | SONAR | SILENCE | MINE |TRIGGER | MSG is possible :P
 GetSchwifty: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 GetSchwifty: i accept the challenge, fireworks on last move
 GetSchwifty: engage all systems
 Zenoscave: you can only do one of each lol not multiple triggers
 struct: and cant trigger the mine you just placed
 Zenoscave: that too
 struct: cant seem to find a map with &lt; 4 islands&#160;:(
 tonowak: struct yeah the probability for x islands is exponential
 harshch000: can bots use multiple threads now?
 Zenoscave: not that i think harshch000
 AntiSquid: hi harshch000 forgot you even exist, how are you?
 harshch000: Hey I'm good, first time on this website for a while- bored during quarantine so thought I would play this challenge
 harshch000: how is ocean of code
 harshch000: is it fun
 Zenoscave: very
 AntiSquid: super complicated
 AntiSquid: hardest game on CG imo
 harshch000: hmm that's fun
 AntiSquid: so depends if that's what you enjoy then it's 100% fun
 Zenoscave: Harder than BitRunner&#160;?&#160;;)
 harshch000: What kind of hard? Lots of data/input and hard to model or just hard to simulate or hard to do AI for?
 Zenoscave: Hard to do AI for. incomplete info
 harshch000: is the ref code available?
 Zenoscave: yes
 AntiSquid: zeno bit runner has complete info no?
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code</a>
 Zenoscave: I was only joking. 
 Zenoscave: I agree with your assessment AntiSquid
 harshch000: ok thx
 harshch000: glad it's a month
 Zenoscave: same
 YannT: #18 with all the fixes &lt;o/
 YannT: but I don't do mines
 YannT: everybody does mines
 Zenoscave: mines are hard to time with other charging
 YannT: I can see everybody's resolved it by just not doing sonar
 YannT: or very little
 Zenoscave: Yes
 Zenoscave: no sonar unless all else is full here
 YannT: but if you mine spam it never gonna be full
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 YannT: tomorrow I'm gonna sonar less and mine stuff up
 YannT: also maybe stop dashing head first into corners
 YannT: life goals
 Zenoscave: Oh that reminded me of a fix i needed. thanks
 YannT: I have a floodfill for moving around in a semi decent manner but I basically silence away at random and screw myself more often than not :p
 struct: 200 million maps and none with &lt;= 3 islands&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: 200 million!!!!!
 KarolisZilevicius: zdarova
 AntiSquid: hello&#160;?
 YannT: you mean 3 landmasses or 3 island squares
 AntiSquid: italy 6k deaths O_O
 Zenoscave: 18th :P
 AntiSquid: gratz zeno
 Zenoscave: errr 19th
 Zenoscave: thx
 AntiSquid: apart from predicting opponent what do you have?
 Zenoscave: reducing their predictions of me
 Zenoscave: that's the big one
 AntiSquid: ha
 AntiSquid: and you have a strategy too&#160;? lure / trap / attack / run / self-isolate&#160;?
 Zenoscave: not really
 struct: 1000mill no 3 island
 struct: I quit
 AntiSquid: you pressed play my code 1000mil times?
 struct: ofc
 struct: and I counted every island
 Zenoscave: whoa
 struct: im running it localy
 struct: its around 1 mill maps each 2 to 3 sec
 Zenoscave: you spent like 45 min running  that?
 Zenoscave: why?
 Astrobytes: He's avoiding writing his bot
 Astrobytes: So he can delete the day before it ends
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: I have mixed feelings about the game
 struct: havent started yet
 Astrobytes: I didn't get much done today for virus reasons, but I quite like it. It's challenging
 AntiSquid: after all the struggle i realize i need a different approach, was it worth it? maybe if i learned something in the long run 
 struct: I was gonna start
 struct: But c++ and strings
 struct: meh
 kbrock: every iteration you have a "structure" that is your current move. what are people using?
 kbrock: I thought an array of rounds you play as the first, but then I thought rounds that you skip. Now I'm wondering if I should store the number of rounds that I play (relative) - any suggestions?
 MostComplicatedUsername: I still haven't gotten around to creating the bo
 MostComplicatedUsername: t
 MostComplicatedUsername: Too lazy
 icecream17: hmm. a function takes 37ms and combined with the other stuff can timeout. what do i do?
 BenjaminUrquhart: make it not take so long
 Soonies: lul
 MostComplicatedUsername: If the other stuff makes it timeout, something's wrong
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: What's wrong with the font for ocean of code?
 MostComplicatedUsername: I can't read it
 Soonies: i personnaly recommend Comic Sans ms&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: I recommend times new roman
 MostComplicatedUsername: It's the easiest to read
 icecream17: Oh no. 2672ms
 icecream17: The only difference is code after it...
 icecream17: Time to reredelete my code.
 Flyingkid: profile it and optimize
 Flyingkid: you could copy input and run locally and see what's slow
 Waffle3z: Illedan disappeared from the leaderboard
 struct: he said that he would
 struct: he is starting from start I think

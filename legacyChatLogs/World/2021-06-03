 Lueyung: Idk where to start
 Lueyung: any sugg for a beginner
 Chainman: heyyyy
 Best-Coder12: My English and my coding are both bad. Now I can communicate with google translate. Does anyone know of a simple coding site?:sob:
 Luj8n: codewars is a good one
 Bye_Byu07: nice choice
 Pick8chu: hihihi
 Bye_Byu07: hoehoehoe
 Butcher2013: join samsung sds

 Dougie760: hi
 Youcef_Abdellani: Hi
 SHAIT: Hi
 Chainman: hi
 SHAIT: How you lot doing?
 SHAIT: umm.... hello?
 SHAIT: dickheads
 SHAIT: jk
 jacek: oO
 SHAIT: JK man 
 Astrobytes: Ban next time,
 jacek: NochillBytes
 bltntLego: ppl acc use this. kinda cringe ngl
 Astrobytes: What?
 bltntLego: idk
 bltntLego: im here cos of school
 Astrobytes: Well go and learn
 Astrobytes: Stay out the chat unless you have a question.
 bltntLego: i guess
 KalamariKing: That's what you're here for, isn't it? learning?
 bltntLego: but like
 bltntLego: is there any sort of lessons or sumthin
 KalamariKing: If you're in class right now or your teacher wants you here, then you shouldn't be in chat
 KalamariKing: This site isn't for learning/beginners, but more of practice/challenges
 Astrobytes: Have you not learned any coding whatsoever in your class?
 bltntLego: i have
 bltntLego: python 3 basics
 bltntLego: well
 bltntLego: yes pretty much basics
 Astrobytes: Which puzzle are you supposed to do?
 bltntLego: so I'm in the Loops training
 SHAIT: Hey man sorry for that lmao
 bltntLego: im asked to do 3 loops puzzles
 Astrobytes: You were told to do this or you chose it?
 SHAIT: Its just banter
 jacek: temperatures and the descent are easy
 Astrobytes: np SHAIT but fix your banter :P
 Astrobytes: Thor if you haven't already done it
 bltntLego: i was told to do it
 Astrobytes: Don't do anything outside of the easy puzzle section for now
 bltntLego: ok i wont
 bltntLego: thanks
 KalamariKing: wait, ok, do some people adapt easy challenges into clashes? I swear I've seen this before
 Astrobytes: Maybe some related subject or simplified version, possible. 
 jacek: time to convert space maze into clash
 Astrobytes: :P
 sprkrd: Nintendo would be even a harder one, wouldn't it?
 Astrobytes: lol. Guess that depends on your mathematical and crypto skill level  :)
 sprkrd: At least in Space Maze you have a clear vision of what you have to do. It's an implementation challenge more than a conceptual one
 jacek: so i would turn that into ascii. ezpz
 sprkrd: I remember around the time I was working on the Nintendo problem, there was some notice that Nintendo was working on a new console. A year or so after that, I realized that they were probably talking about the Switch :O
 sprkrd: Should I ever had an interview with them, maybe there would be a little part of me in the Switch (assuming my conjecture is right)
 MSmits: hi there
 sprkrd: Yo
 KalamariKing: Hey
 MSmits: 30 seed book finishing today. I am guessing it will have taken around 15 hrs
 MSmits: then 31 will prolly take 24 hrs or so
 MSmits: not sure if i will get to 36 in a reasonable amount of time even though I have the memory =/
 sprkrd: what are you up to? Chess? You were talking about books yesterday too
 MSmits: oware
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa</a>
 sprkrd: And when you say books, you mean opening books?
 MSmits: no, endgame books
 MSmits: first solve all states with 1 seed, then 2 seeds, then 3 seeds etc.
 MSmits: full game has 48
 MSmits: realistically, i can get max 36 i think
 MSmits: google could do 48 easily
 sprkrd: oh god, will you be able to submit that to CG? Or is it just for local?
 MSmits: local, but i want to use the data for supervised learning of a NN
 MSmits: submitting to CG will be a bit hard. Total amount of data will probably be around 50-60 GB:P
 sprkrd: I see. Dunno the game, but probably there are a lot of symmetries and rotations that you can exploit. Isomorphic states and all that
 MSmits: there are not any
 jacek: not much in oware
 MSmits: none at all
 MSmits: 0 symmetries
 MSmits: just transpositions
 sprkrd: Oh, hence my disclaimer about not knowing the game :sweat_smile:
 sprkrd: My conjecture was purely based on the preview
 MSmits: yeah, many games here have symmetries
 MSmits: yavalath has 12
 KalamariKing: jeez
 MSmits: most have 8
 jacek: those squares :unamused:
 MSmits: nine mens morris is nice because it has 16 symmetries if i counted them correctly
 sprkrd: Maybe you can start a distributed computing project to get you book for all 48 seeds
 MSmits: you can exchange inner and outer ring
 MSmits: sprkrd the problem is that you cant really distribute it very well
 MSmits: you need to refer to all the lower books
 MSmits: everywhere in memory
 MSmits: bottleneck is lookups
 MSmits: not calculation
 MSmits: i am not sure if you can parallelize disk access
 sprkrd: Mmmh, yeah, if it's +50GB you have to exchange information with the disk all the time
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: d you have SSD nvme?
 MSmits: i have SSD yeah
 KalamariKing: nvme or sata?
 MSmits: hmm, not sure actually
 sprkrd: Linux?
 sprkrd: in linux you can list all the devices in /dev
 MSmits: windows
 KalamariKing: is it uber-fast or only mostly fast
 sprkrd: if there's one device that starts with nvm, then it's nvme
 sprkrd: ah, then dunno anything about windows
 sprkrd: probably there's a way to know, too, should you be intereseted
 sprkrd: interested*
 KalamariKing: You could go through the properties tab on disk management, but ig it doesn't particularly matter
 KalamariKing: Just be cautious not to overload the drive, flash chips only have so many write cycles
 sprkrd: Use SMART regularly to run diagnosis and all that :relieved:
 jacek: the limited write cycles isnt problem in typical usage
 jacek: but is generating endgame books typical usage? :thinking:
 sprkrd: I mean, when you install a modern game you can also end up moving around +60GB of data
 sprkrd: So I would say it's not that bad
 sprkrd: I did the calculation for my drive, and its lifetime in terms of write cycles is way beyond its lifetime on terms of other factors
 sprkrd: SMART still shows a 0% "write budget" usage after 2 years
 KalamariKing: Could have just had bad chips, but I killed a few blocks on my old ssd messing with nn stuff
 sprkrd: couldve been older drive too. recent nvme drives have much longer lifespans
 MSmits: endgame books is not typical usage&#160;:)
 MSmits: I take 2 bytes at a time
 MSmits: randomly 
 KalamariKing: yeah ok, that'
 KalamariKing: s not bad
 MSmits: could be anywhere on the disk basically
 MSmits: with a large enough book
 MSmits: i dont mean random but... just a full spread
 MSmits: unpredictable
 KalamariKing: I was reading a couple mb from the same bits, so they wore out
 KalamariKing: like, a couple million times
 MSmits: wow that happens 1?
 MSmits:&#160;??
 jacek: from reading?
 KalamariKing: writing and reading
 MSmits: what do you mean only so many cycles, do you mean in its lifetime?
 MSmits: or per second/
 KalamariKing: didn't have too much knowledge abt 'optimization' and 'load that into ram
 KalamariKing: yeah, lifetime
 MSmits: I load everything in RAM that I can
 MSmits: but it gets full&#160;:)
 MSmits: using 30 GB for it atm
 KalamariKing: how much ram you got?
 sprkrd: Just another reason why NNs are bad :no_mouth:
 KalamariKing: jesus
 MSmits: I have 32
 MSmits: sprkrd this is not typical for NN&#160;:)
 MSmits: just the way i choose to do it
 MSmits: NN usually tax the cpu/gpu or maybe tpu, not  your SSD
 sprkrd: MSmits No no, I was talking about KalamariKing wasted SSD
 MSmits: ohh ok
 KalamariKing: the only reason I wore out the chips is because I was using a potato laptop with a measly 2gb ddr3
 MSmits: oh, this was using some kind of swap file because of lack of RAM&#160;?
 KalamariKing: Yeah pretty much
 MSmits: I see
 KalamariKing: But it was... diy, and not built at all smartly
 MSmits: well when I use a meta mcts, I tend to store in a persistent dictionary, so thats a lot of drive usage also
 KalamariKing: true, yeah
 codin_computer: help
 MSmits: is there some way to diagnose your SSD, to check how close it is to needing replacement?
 KalamariKing: with&gt;
 sprkrd: MSmits I could tell you in Linux
 KalamariKing: MSmits I use samsung magician, but my drive uses samsung flash
 sprkrd: In Windows, no idea, but it must be easy, sure enough
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: knowing it's possible is enough, google does the rest&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: windows doesn't provide much in the category of hardware testing, its all community
 MSmits: I see
 jacek: google smart ssd windows&#160;:?
 sprkrd: (I'm not a Windows hater btw, but most of my technical experience is with Linux, I use Windows mostly for games)
 KalamariKing: Yeah, same... linux is getting better gaming capability, but windows steam is better
 KalamariKing: linux has much less overhead and much 'deeper' tools tho
 KalamariKing: and the os doesn't hog 40% of your cpu at all times :eyes:
 sprkrd: I don't like to mix things up. Even if Linux gaming was on par with Windows, having the "games" partition and the "work" partition feels natural to me
 sprkrd: then I have a classic HDD I use to share files between the 2
 sprkrd: Did the whole computer set-up myself. I take pride on that :D
 KalamariKing: building too?
 sprkrd: Yeah
 MSmits: windows does not hog 40% of my cpu :P
 codin_computer: hi sprked
 sprkrd: Back when you could buy GPUs
 sprkrd: Nowadays you can't
 sprkrd: Yo, sup
 KalamariKing: Yeah lol, not even prebuilts have them
 codin_computer: remember me
 KalamariKing: codin_computer you said you needed help? just ask
 MSmits: I think windows uses 1% or less depending on what i do
 codin_computer: yeah i fixed it
 KalamariKing: nice
 KalamariKing: MSmits lucky
 MSmits: not really, it helps if you have a modern 10 core cpu :P
 codin_computer: wow...
 codin_computer: i think i need help actually
 KalamariKing: I have an 8 core I think, r7 2700x
 MSmits: oh thats fine
 sprkrd: codin_computer yeah, I remember :relieved:
 MSmits:  upgraded from 4 core old cpu
 KalamariKing: handles rendering just fine, so I'm sure its fine
 MSmits: rendering should be done by gpu
 MSmits: afaik
 sprkrd: there's a benchmark for CPUs based on rendering
 MSmits: oh I see
 KalamariKing: that and I do 3d rendering
 codin_computer: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 sprkrd: It's not its intended usage, is just for throwing some numbers on how fast you CPU is
 MSmits: ahh
 KalamariKing: codin_computer literally just ask
 <b>**codin_computer flips a table</b></p><p><img src="/a/65283280239814" /> codin_computer: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: he's trolling
 KalamariKing: probably
 MSmits: was trolling yesterday
 codin_computer:&#160;???
 MSmits: Astrobytes 
 codin_computer: are you a real teacher/
 MSmits: yeah
 KalamariKing: yeah he is
 sprkrd: As opposed to a fake one? :thinking:
 codin_computer: WELL WORK ON YOUR SPELLING AND STUFF
 MSmits: ok
 Uljahn: oO
 codin_computer: :rage:
 sprkrd: good heavens
 Uljahn: Astrobytes
 codin_computer: :rage:
 KalamariKing: CPU rendering is better for smaller blocks, say 4x4 pixels (with cycles)GPU renders whole images faster (again with cycles)
 KalamariKing: cpu just happens to be faster
 MSmits: I barely use my gpu
 KalamariKing: cycles is the name of the render engine byw
 KalamariKing: btw*
 MSmits: I have a 1060 GTX, oldest thing in my PC
 codin_computer: /me..
 <b>**codin_computer /me = cool messages</b></p><p><img src="/a/65283280239814" /> codin_computer: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 KalamariKing: and ofc as soon as I get a job, and can finally afford something like a 5600x, there's none in stock
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 codin_computer: why is it telling me to do this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/chuck-norris">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/chuck-norris</a>
 KalamariKing: why is what telling you to do what
 MSmits: to get you off our backs 
 MSmits: keep you busy
 codin_computer: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 KalamariKing: oh that one was pretty simple codin_computer you should leave us alone and go do it
 <b>**codin_computer flips a table on MSmits</b></p><p><img src="/a/3876179544657" /> sprkrd: Mine is a RTX 2060S, which feels kind of wasted since I do not do DL at all. And my most recent interest game-wise is Factorio, which is not too graphically intensive :joy:
 MSmits: DL?
 sprkrd: Deep Learning
 MSmits: oh ok
 KalamariKing: y'all over here like "*just* a gtx1060"
 MSmits: well not just, but it's my oldest component. Did not replace it because it's not critical for me.
 MSmits: might become critical when i do serious training though
 sprkrd: GTX1060 is fine
 KalamariKing: training uses gpu, right
 MSmits: or cpu
 sprkrd: you could do it in CPU
 KalamariKing: but its generally faster on gpu?
 sprkrd: Generally
 MSmits: i did my TTT experiments on cpu
 MSmits: lots faster i think
 KalamariKing: due to clocks+faster ram or just the sheer number of cores
 MSmits: cores
 MSmits: it's very parallelizable 
 sprkrd: With a large enough network it's faster
 KalamariKing: wait a sec
 KalamariKing: would the new crypto cards, with way too many cores for a normal person to use, be applicable to training
 sprkrd: if your network is just 2 hidden layers with 10 neurons each, then it's faster in CPU :joy:
 MSmits: yeah you need to actually parallelize stuff so need a big network
 MSmits: dont know how many cores those cards have
 sprkrd: Yours?
 MSmits: but layers with 10k nodes are fairly common
 sprkrd: For images, yeah
 MSmits: I have no idea how big mine will be
 MSmits: but needs to fit in CG limits
 MSmits: so maybe 10k weights or so
 sprkrd: For CG games, I'd say a layer with 10k nodes is a bit excessive :joy:
 MSmits: 1 hidden layer
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: sorry
 MSmits: weights
 sprkrd: ah, right
 sprkrd: 10k weights feels about right
 MSmits: could be more, 50k even, depends on how you compress and what float type you use (could use 16 bit floats)
 1rre: me and the boys using c to fit bruteforcing within cg limits
 MSmits: but should not be needlessly big because of overfitting and performance
 KalamariKing: The new nVidia CMP 40hx has like 300 tensor cores
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: Please state the nature of your technical emergency.
 MSmits: oh the ETH is here
 Astrobytes: (responding to the ping)
 MSmits: codin_computer was spamming
 KalamariKing: ok, yeah, not great - twice the price for less cores
 KalamariKing: shame
 Astrobytes: Isn't he a troll?
 MSmits: he is
 Astrobytes: Kicked. Ban next time.
 Astrobytes: Sorry for the delay. Was afk.
 MSmits: thanks, it's good to have a ETH
 Astrobytes: :D
 KalamariKing: eth?
 sprkrd: What's ETH?
 MSmits: emergency technical hologram
 Astrobytes: ^
 KalamariKing: oh I see
 MSmits: if you dont get the reference, watch more star trek
 Astrobytes: Watch more Star Trek either way.
 MSmits: yeah
 KiwiTae: i never saw that show
 MSmits: hmm, then a piece of you is missing
 MSmits: mind not fully grown
 MSmits: fix it&#160;:)
 sprkrd: My favorite episode is the Data trial&#160;:)
 MSmits: this is TNG I assume?
 Astrobytes: That the Bruce Maddox one?
 sprkrd: TNG, yes
 MSmits: i only watched all TNG twice i think
 MSmits: been a while
 MSmits: DS9 I think 4 times, voyager 2 times, enterprise 2 times
 sprkrd: Astrobytes Yes, Bruce Maddox
 Astrobytes: I rewatched that after watching Picard
 MSmits: I have amazon prime now, but watched picard less than legally. Normally wouldn't, but made an exception :P
 Astrobytes: Heh heh. No comment!
 Astrobytes: Tis excellent though. Must rewatch soon.
 MSmits: yeah will rewatch it
 sprkrd: Have to go, see you arouuuun d :musical_note: :notes:
 MSmits: i mean there's only so many times i can do breaking bad
 Astrobytes: later sprkrd
 MSmits: later
 Astrobytes: I need to watch Better Call Saul again
 MSmits: not sure i will rewatch it. I thought it was good, but it's normally not the kind of shows i watch
 MSmits: so one time might be enough
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it was unusual for me too. I thought it was great though, to my surprise.
 MSmits: is the boys season 3 out yet?
 Astrobytes: Last season (6, Saul) is out next year
 MSmits: ah ok will watch that
 Astrobytes: Not sure. I've still to watch that. It's on my list
 MSmits: it's awesome
 Astrobytes: Must get around to that
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've seen bits
 MSmits: if you've seen the first 10 minutes, you cant stop
 Astrobytes: I've seen clips. Not the first 10 mins, but that's what I heard yeah
 MSmits: most awesome and horrifying opening to a show i ever saw :P
 Astrobytes: I'm down for that
 MSmits: it has a lot of absurd humor
 MSmits: kind of like thor ragnarok, but less over the top and bloodier
 Astrobytes: Absurd humour is good for me. It's pretty dark too right?
 MSmits: yeah it's dark
 MSmits: but could be worse
 MSmits: it's not depressing or anything
 Astrobytes: No, just dark.
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: I've made a note for the weekend to remind me
 MSmits: cool, let me know
 Astrobytes: I will do
 KalamariKing: are y'all nerds done yet
 Astrobytes: Yep. Carry on :P
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: oh I was wondering, do we have any bitboard resources on tech.io already?
 MSmits: I mean people shared mcts stuff and such
 MSmits: but not sure if they shared bit tricks
 Astrobytes: e m h did a bitboarded BFS? I think
 MSmits: oh right, I did too
 Astrobytes: Other than that, not really no
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: I was thinking to do one for uttt, maybe with a few examples from other games added on
 MSmits: because uttt is kinda simple when it comes to bitboarding
 Astrobytes: Sure. Would be useful and save a lot of time in the chat!
 MSmits: Yeah
 codin_computer: I AM NOT A TROLL
 Astrobytes: behave or be banned
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes o/
 codin_computer: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU MEAN
 Astrobytes: STOP TYPING IN CAPS for a start
 KiwiTae: codin_computer you got all caps locked
 Astrobytes: KiwiTae hey hey
 codin_computer: well i wasnt spamming
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes how the weather in scotland 
 KiwiTae: :kissing_heart:
 Astrobytes: Not as nice as the past few days but sunny, about 18C
 MSmits: too hot here
 Astrobytes: The weather or room temp from your PC?
 MSmits: well it doesnt take much before i think it's too hot. If my room doesnt have to be heated, its too hot
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: room is large enough that pc wont bother it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Fair. 30 seeds did I read earlier?
 MSmits: yea its almost done
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8156ba82-b726-4710-9a31-d7b6e079077d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8156ba82-b726-4710-9a31-d7b6e079077d</a>
 MSmits: 5  states left that are still changing over turns added
 MSmits: so maybe 1 or 2 more iterations
 MSmits: 20 mins or so
 Astrobytes: Impressive. How much further do do you think you can get? seed count wise
 MSmits: 36 if i cache information required from older books in RAM, 37 and 38 seeds will not be able to use a cache because there is not enough room
 MSmits: so that might mean it takes like a month, not sure
 MSmits: so 36 is realistic
 MSmits: but could be 1 day, then 2 days, then 4 days etc.
 MSmits: to get from 31 to 36
 Astrobytes: Still impressive.
 KalamariKing: you could use virtual ram, if thats whats holding it back
 MSmits: yeah its nice i wrote a verifier earlier, did 1 million samples over all books and no inconsistencies, seems to be correct
 MSmits: KalamariKing virtual ram is just using disk space isnt it?
 KalamariKing: windows has a feature where you can allocate disk space as ram, it may be slow but 32gb RAM + 2gb slow is better than 34gb slow
 MSmits: yes, but when i am not using a cache for 38 seeds, it means using 29 GB RAM + around 90 GB slow :P
 MSmits: so i am already using as much RAM as i can
 KalamariKing: yeah, true
 MSmits: cache needs to be about 60% of the full size of the book
 MSmits: so at some point it just wont fit
 MSmits: to solve the game I would need around 1 TB RAM 
 Astrobytes: Get downloading :P
 MSmits: or just be really slow and use 1TB disk space&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: oh btw, even if i solved the game, i would not have solved it on CG, because i assume no turn limit
 MSmits: with turn limit I need to store a different result for each amount of turns left
 MSmits: so 200x larger, or at least 185 or so
 MSmits: my CG version with 9 seeds does this and thats why its only 9
 Xzoky174: man.. programming is so harddd :tired_face:
 MSmits: programming is relative to your task
 MSmits: if you pick a task that is too hard, you dont learn and if you pick one thats too easy, you wont learn either
 KalamariKing: I forget who but someone famous said it takes 10,000 hours to master something
 MSmits: yeah its a good rule of thumb, but its hard to define this something
 MSmits: for example you can subdivide a field 
 MSmits: and then it;s less to master
 MSmits: so what is the "something" 
 MSmits: you can define it as "computer scientist" but then it's too general
 MSmits: you might never have done machine learning
 MSmits: also mastering riding a bike does not take 10000 hrs 
 MSmits: i think it's mostly supposed to be in the context of learning a profession
 Astrobytes: Mastering it to be competitive might
 MSmits: sure, but after 10.000 hours you're maybe too old :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: iterations: 60 different: 1 863 minutes.
 Astrobytes: Nice. should be about 20 mins as you said then
 MSmits: that means it just went through 3 billion gamestate and redid all moves and all states but 1 gave the same result
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I figured it was something like that.
 KalamariKing: 863 minutes?
 KalamariKing: how do you have the patience for that
 MSmits: for 30 seeds book yes
 MSmits: it's just running in the background
 MSmits: i can do other stuff. I wrote a verifier as it was running and also working on the meta mcts which will use the book
 MSmits: meta mcts might run for weeks
 MSmits: I like big projects&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: :cold_sweat:
 KalamariKing: I'll stop a project after like half an hour because its not optimized enough for my patience level
 KalamariKing: GG my guy
 MSmits: heh, well you have to do some effort to beat some of these guys, but I'm probably taking it too far
 Pexxyz: HEHE
 KalamariKing: what
 Pexxyz: HEHEHEEEE
 Pexxyz: i wont spam
 KalamariKing: you already are
 KalamariKing: but thanks
 Butanium: MSmits are you here?
 Butanium: I just finished debugging my MCTS x)
 KalamariKing: I think he's here, or at least lurking
 Butanium: It bugged because I calculated the possible actions for the new node before doing the chosen action for it
 darkhorse64: submit
 Butanium: I did it but for now my playouts are completly random
 Butanium: Which is quite bad
 KalamariKing: I thought playouts are supposed to be random
 Butanium: oh
 Butanium: I forgot to change the exploration duration
 Butanium: it has 1 ms to do the tree lol
 darkhorse64: ofc smart rollouts are better but they cost also a lot which hampers the quality of the search. My C4 bot is stronger with smart rollouts but not that much
 KalamariKing: :eyes:
 MSmits: I'm here
 MSmits: if you want an example of a game where smart rollouts matter, try yavalath
 KalamariKing: He's here
 MSmits: smart rollouts are everything there
 MSmits: i think it helps in C4 as well, but did not do proper testing
 Butanium: so for now you don't have any smart rollout for C4?
 MSmits: no, I mean I do
 MSmits: basically it works like this
 MSmits: check if any moves you make give the opponent a chance to win next turn
 MSmits: then dont make those moves
 MSmits: random the rest
 KalamariKing: ezpz
 MSmits: the trick is to code it efficiently of course, but it should help even if you implement it less than perfectly
 KalamariKing: how can your move make the opponent's move easier?
 KalamariKing: we're talking ttt right?
 MSmits: no, connect 4
 darkhorse64: aka don't play losing moves
 MSmits: yeah thats what that is
 Butanium: That's exactly what I planned to add&#160;! 
 MSmits: cool, good luck&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: but what about winning moves that would let the opp win next turn
 KalamariKing: you've already won so that wouldn't matter
 MSmits: well, my rollout has no winning moves
 MSmits: because if the opponent has no moves that would not make you win,he auto loses
 MSmits: so there are only losses in my rollout
 MSmits: it's actually annoying, because if wins are never part of tree you have to get tricky to actually output a winning move at the end :P
 MSmits: as it is not in your tree
 MSmits: it's like chess
 Butanium: I'm at 10k rollouts per turn &gt;&lt;
 MSmits: if your king has no move left where he is in check, its checkmate
 MSmits: Butanium a rollout is one random playout/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 Butanium: yes
 MSmits: thats very little
 jacek: no bitboard eh
 Butanium: I feel like ocaml is very slow at copying arrays
 MSmits: but hey, if you're trick is to get the maximum performance out of a subpar language, you should be ok at some point. Otherwise you need to switch to c++ or rust
 MSmits: o rc
 KalamariKing: or c*
 jacek: or asm
 MSmits: right
 KalamariKing: or hexadecimal
 darkhorse64: bitboarding + AVX is like asm
 MSmits: chess bitboarders keep close eye on generated asm
 MSmits: I never did that
 KalamariKing: avx?
 MSmits: parallelized calculations
 MSmits: without needing more cores
 jacek: wonder if reBless fell into that chess hole
 KalamariKing: how's that work
 darkhorse64: the compiler generates code that is like the C++ code
 MSmits: there's special registers
 MSmits: that can multiply 8 numbers at the same time 
 jacek: do you know SIMD
 MSmits: for example
 MSmits: or do other simple functions
 KalamariKing: I don't like that
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: whats not to like
 KalamariKing: How can it multiply multiple numbers at once? wouldn't a in a*b contaminate c in c*d if they're done at the same time?
 jacek: chances the good for loop is optimized to avx by compiler
 MSmits: no, i dont mean like that
 MSmits: i mean say you're using a loop
 KalamariKing: oh hmm
 MSmits: doing 8 things
 MSmits: but they are independent operations
 MSmits: why not do them all at the same time
 KalamariKing: how tho
 jacek: you have array of 8 numbers, then other array of 8 numbers. you can multiply them 8 times at a time
 darkhorse64: Actually, my AVX code is not faster than my scalar code
 MSmits: in C4
 MSmits: but in othello it would be
 MSmits: othello is great for avx
 KalamariKing: this makes only a little sense, I'll just drop it here
 darkhorse64: yep in othello
 MSmits: KalamariKing it is really quite simple
 MSmits: say you're having 8 numbers that have to be multiplied by 8 other numbers
 MSmits: each separately
 jacek: you can get over 300% speedup for some cases
 MSmits: why could you not parallelize this?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/sseavx-c-frameworks">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/sseavx-c-frameworks</a>
 KalamariKing: I get how it works in theory, but in application, how can a processor do 8 things at once
 KalamariKing: that's the issue
 MSmits: they are very close in memory and its a very small amount of data, i dont know the exact physical process
 jacek: ask cpu guys
 MSmits: you can only do 8 or 16 of these operations at the same time
 MSmits: depends on the type of variable
 MSmits: int16 or int32 or whatnot
 MSmits: CG uses 256 bit max
 MSmits: so 8 x16
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: 16 x 16
 MSmits: 8 x 32
 MSmits: it's not a magical trick that always helps though KalamariKing, it's pretty rare to have situations where it's worth it
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/what-is-sse-and-avx">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/what-is-sse-and-avx</a>
 MSmits: but some boardgames are built for it almost
 MSmits: chess can use it, othello can, probably a few others
 MSmits: people do it on CSB
 MSmits: (I still havent)
 MSmits: on CSB you go from 300k simulations to around a million
 MSmits: in 1 turn
 MSmits: i've been tol
 KalamariKing: this is so weird
 MSmits: i can give you a very simple function that does it
 MSmits: like 5 lines or so
 MSmits: for uttt 
 KalamariKing: That parts' easy
 KalamariKing: I just don't get on a hardware level, how
 KalamariKing: Gonna go dive down the rabbit hole, brb
 jacek: maybe this is pipeline stuff(?)
 jacek: other interesting thing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array?rq=1">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array?rq=1</a>

 jacek: cpus nowadays are so smart
 MSmits: this checks all 8 winning lines for uttt at the same time
 MSmits: for a miniboard
 MSmits: so actually normal ttt i guess&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: KalamariKing: The link I posted gives you a rough idea hardware wise
 jacek: you dont have lookup for that? :o
 MSmits: i do
 MSmits: but this works too
 MSmits: struct says its slightly faster, i never tested
 MSmits: I wrote this myself, but struct made an improvement&#160;:)
 BestProgrammist: Hello
 KalamariKing: Hello!
 BestProgrammist: what is yor name
 KalamariKing: ask your mom
 BestProgrammist: ha
 jacek: oO
 Butanium: I just realized something
 Butanium: my MCTS
 Butanium: play
 Butanium: as the opponent
 Uljahn: classic
 Butanium: that's why it lost more with more playouts
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: typical mcts problem
 Butanium: I was like "lol it defend well but doesn't attack"
 Butanium: aaaaah
 Butanium: I thought it would be easy to fix it
 Butanium: &gt;&lt;
 MSmits: learning mcts is really a matter of hanging in there
 MSmits: personally I would recommend doing minimax first
 MSmits: it's simpler
 MSmits: but for some games less effective
 MSmits: once you have 1 game working, you can swap out the sim part of your bot and use it in other games
 Butanium: doesn't minmax need an heuristic eval of the state?
 Butanium: or I can just run it with no depth limit?
 Astrobytes: Heuristic eval yes, and use iterative deepening
 dmytrostrembetskyi: :dog:
 MSmits: Butanium it does need a heuristic eval, but keep in mind that for many games, mcts does also
 MSmits: oware can take 200 turns to finish. You dont want to have to do random playouts that long. Besides, the statistics become meaningless with that depth
 MSmits: so you pick at most some depth and evaluate, then backpropagate the score
 MSmits: instead of win/loss
 MSmits: otherwise its similar
 Butanium: ok I see
 Butanium: But I have almorst a MCTS working
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: so dont give up&#160;:)
 Butanium: I'll first try to fix it
 MSmits: btw mcts was also my first search
 MSmits: I learned minimax later, but it was much easier
 Butanium: oh ok :o
 jacek: or it was much easier because you did mcts first
 MSmits: possible
 MSmits: have workmeeting ttyl 
 KalamariKing: going back and doing some of the easy challenges that I couldn't do originally..... wow I was incredibly stupid
 DuckKnight_quack69: @kalamariKing right now i feel stupid i cant solve anything:worried::sweat_smile:
 KalamariKing: you'll get there
 KalamariKing: idk why everyone in world hates clashes so much, but I got better by grinding clashes
 KelvinAndHubbles: they're good if your trying to learn from them, but you can also just turn your brain off and do a lot and learn nothing
 reCurse: Not sure what you can actually learn from them, but hey whatever works for you.
 Lucky30_: you guys are wonderful 
 KalamariKing: thanks?
 Lucky30_: not sure hhh
 Lucky30_: weird question, why are there so many moderators
 KalamariKing: i have the same question
 KalamariKing: I think its because there has to be some online at all times
 reCurse: They also tend to be selected amongst the most active, so there's that
 reCurse: (which is the point)
 Lucky30_: coool
 jacek: whoever failed to run away becomes a mod
 Lucky30_: hhhhh
 Lucky30_: jacek how far are you?
 RoboStac: he's still running
 reCurse: Obligatory 'not far enough'
 Lucky30_: hhhh
 jacek:&#160;:(
 KalamariKing: new goal: get mod
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid will probably be mad if I keep pinging him so i'll stop
 KalamariKing: sorry AntiSquid
 Lucky30_: sorry KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: when AntiSquid gets back online he'll have so many pings
 KalamariKing: rip AntiSquid's inbox
 Lucky30_: the more the merrier 
 KalamariKing: what would happen if everyone in chat rn were to collectively ping-spam AntiSquid
 Lucky30_: some ppl do like being ping to eat, especially when it is free kalamar
 KalamariKing: if you start sending me pictures of fried calamari istg
 Lucky30_: what, you will run from your plate??
 Lucky30_: how do i actually send pictures in cg
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid usually just pastes links
 Lucky30_: ow ok, easy enough
 Lucky30_: are you free for some browing
 Lucky30_: *browsing
 KalamariKing: look another spelling mistake
 KalamariKing: your soul is one typo closer to being mine
 Lucky30_: not me 
 sprkrd: Is AntiSq*id's nickname a specific reference to you, KalamariKing?
 sprkrd: Did he make his sole purpose to eradicate you?
 KalamariKing: I think it's just a coincidence lol
 Lucky30_: guys, KalamariKing just sent me a rainbow, what does it mean? peace??
 KalamariKing: although now that you mention it... might be
 KalamariKing: did you not see the rainbow was arcing into a dumpster
 Lucky30_: ow ok, so no peace then hhhh
 KalamariKing: the only peace I like is the pieces of your soul after your final typo
 Lucky30_: he is planning to store my soul in a dumpster
 KalamariKing: nah just the body
 Lucky30_: please grant me the power of no-typo-ever-in-the-presence-of-KalamariKing
 Lucky30_: please god, only this one life time
 KalamariKing: there's no god up here but ME
 clickers331: k
 Lucky30_: god KalamariKing please grant my wish
 StevensGino: I see the chat is pumping thank to 2 of you
 WhatHowWhy: careful with those typos, friend, KK is watching.
 Lucky30_: i hate it too, dont worrie StevensGino
 Westicles: How should I rate this SHA-256 puzzle?
 StevensGino: just kidding haha
 Lucky30_: i know, we all afraid of the souls reaper
 Lucky30_: you don't have to be ashamed of your self StevensGino
 StevensGino: :D
 Lucky30_: anyways, food time for me, the KalamariKing wont eat them selfs..
 StevensGino: sleeping time for me, bb
 WhatHowWhy: I'll just continue staring at this and hope the code pops into my head.
 KalamariKing: I'm back underlings
 KalamariKing: StevensGino thanks* to*Lucky30_ worry* yourself* themselves*
 KalamariKing: two souls to add to my collection, thanks
 KalamariKing: WhatHowWhy what? how? why?
 Uljahn: FunAtPartiesKing
 1zaid1: are the standings sorted by code length?
 Uljahn: in codegolf yes
 FrancoRoura: Or in shortest mode clash
 1zaid1: well that's stupid
 1zaid1: I was the first to solve a problem and my rank is last
 Uljahn: use bash/ruby/python [solved]
 KalamariKing: it's called shortest mode because you need the... shortest code
 FrancoRoura: The challenge is not to do it fast, it's to find the best language to solve it in the lesser amonut of chars in 15 mins
 MidgetGauntlet: that sounds skill based
 KalamariKing: almost like it were called... shortest mode
 MidgetGauntlet: and super important to know
 FrancoRoura: Award goes to the coder with a broader understanding of languages and their pros/cons
 KalamariKing: isn't all programming skill based
 FrancoRoura: I think it's a great challenge
 JakubBiskup: hey can anyone tell me how exactly is Clash of Code ranking  decaying? 
 Lucky30_: damn, KalamariKing does not grant wishes after all
 KalamariKing: your wishes have been considered
 AntiSquid: you can just bookmark the kalamari ring pictures KalamariKing 
 FrancoRoura: @JakubBiskup Someone else gets more points than you and your rank goes down by 1
 KalamariKing: look its AntiSquid!
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid did you get my pings
 AntiSquid: pings are off anyway
 KalamariKing: Lucky30_ I have just chosen not to care
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid thats cheating
 JakubBiskup: I mean  the not playing makes you loose points part
 FrancoRoura: Oh, that works like ELO in MOBA's or Chess
 KalamariKing: JakubBiskup lose*
 KalamariKing: Are you all just having a stroke over your keyboard and autocorrect does the rest? your typos are horrendous
 FrancoRoura: Nah, we're just non-native speakers trying to do their best
 Lucky30_: if only i could replace my Grammarly browser extension with KalamariKing
 FrancoRoura: You know, like when you try to write in french, polish or german
 Lucky30_: same FrancoRoura
 Uljahn: indeed
 KalamariKing: FrancoRoura our*
 Lucky30_: hhhhh
 Lucky30_: stop it
 FrancoRoura: That sounds like communism but ok
 KalamariKing: if you use "we're" you then have to use "our"
 Lucky30_: KalamariKing how many souls do you have to take
 KalamariKing: Lucky30_ more souls is more power, and I want power
 FrancoRoura: are*
 KalamariKing: generally, yes, but in this case 'more souls' is the idea, and it is a singular idea
 Lucky30_: try not to get eating twice in a row, you would lose them all
 KalamariKing: For that same reason, 'more souls MEANS more power' is correct
 AntiSquid: i've seen some good kalamari ramen video today, can't find it though, it's not in this link, but close enough&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5pKw6flFZE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5pKw6flFZE</a>
 Lucky30_: damn the power you have obtained through out the years
 FrancoRoura: "more souls"*The quotation marks, the apostrophe, and the prime serve quite different purposes.
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: the chat is occupied by grammar nazis, send help
 Automaton2000: yes, but only if they are all in the same state
 Branzz: shortest java header for code golf:
 Branzz: import java.util.*;interface Solution{static void main(String[]o){
 KalamariKing: Apostrophes and quotation marks both denote string literals in Python (although not most other languages) and therefore I don't care FrancoRoura
 KalamariKing: besides I'm the reaper here
 FrancoRoura: I thought we were speaking English, not Python lol
 AntiSquid: you don't have commas or quotation marks and you can use their in the sentence you mentioned KalamariKing ...
 KalamariKing: Branzz thanks but I think java isn't the best for shortest
 Branzz: Obviously not
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid what?
 Lucky30_: Uljahn the answer you got is so accurate.. so scary 
 AntiSquid: and besides the only serious grammar mistakes is confusing your and you're 
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid mistake*
 Lucky30_: ok please just finish him..
 AntiSquid: +s
 Lucky30_: no food should ever be wasted
 AntiSquid: Lucky30_ if that's true then he's a walking snack for his fellow americans
 AntiSquid: nobody needs to do anything
 AntiSquid: i see myself out, laters .
 KalamariKing: you know I'm a snack&#160;;)
 Lucky30_: the sexy snack we all want to eat
 Lucky30_: AntiSquid don't go, i will sell my soul for you
 KalamariKing: it's not yours to sell my guy
 Lucky30_: nooo
 FrancoRoura: sell, my guy*
 Lucky30_: hhhhh
 Lucky30_: a never-ending game of typos
 MidgetGauntlet: cant i write a line that says if ship_height is &lt; mountain_height .... destroy
 MidgetGauntlet: im new - keep the flames small
 FrancoRoura: What language?
 MidgetGauntlet: python3
 FrancoRoura: if ship_height  &lt; mountain_height:
 MidgetGauntlet: wowza, imma plug that in - thank you - at least my ideas arent abstract and seem to work
 FrancoRoura: No problem! Just make sure those two are int and not str
 KalamariKing: str will compare first-char-ascii-codes, right?
 FrancoRoura: Yeah
 FrancoRoura: So "10" &lt; "2" is True
 FrancoRoura: Cool for comparing iso dates, not so much for heights
 Lucky30_: so "100000"&lt;"20"
 KalamariKing: Yes, because '1' &lt; '2'
 Lucky30_: because "1"=='1' &amp;&amp; "2"=='2'
 Lucky30_: hhhhh sorry
 KalamariKing: wdym
 FrancoRoura: Lol
 KalamariKing: oh
 FrancoRoura: He means your previous quote mispell
 KalamariKing: ok listen here
 Lucky30_: #ignore
 KalamariKing: apostrophes are used for character literals, quotes for strings
 Lucky30_: are you sure?
 Lucky30_: i mean for js it is the same
 FrancoRoura: And how does it work for English? @KalamariKing
 Lucky30_: they dont exist in English
 Lucky30_: hhhh
 KalamariKing: Lucky30_ I think in java and the c family its like that
 KalamariKing: I know it is for c++
 Lucky30_: i see
 Lucky30_: nice
 KalamariKing: FrancoRoura A good programmer uses the most convenient language for a task
 Lucky30_: you mean an op programmer
 Lucky30_: a know-it-all kind of programmer
 FrancoRoura: I usually choose what's more maintainable, which is usually what most people understand for a certain task
 FrancoRoura: You know, Python for scripting/batch jobs, JS for websites/apis, etc.
 KalamariKing: wait a sec
 Lucky30_: i usually use (not choose) js for everything, since that is the only language i can say for sure that i can write with it
 FrancoRoura: Unless the API does heavy computing, then I'd go with Go
 KalamariKing: can you grab other object's attributes in css
 FrancoRoura: Wdym?
 KalamariKing: Is there a function in CSS that lets, say, object A grab object B's 'height'
 Lucky30_: do you mean use an attribute of an element?
 FrancoRoura: If your object is part of the dom then maybe, otherwise I don't think so
 KalamariKing: YES
 Lucky30_: maybe by using a psodo class
 KalamariKing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/66297592/8010520">https://stackoverflow.com/a/66297592/8010520</a>
 KalamariKing: who wants to start a challenge with me
 Lucky30_: sure
 KalamariKing: we have var(), calc(), and attr()
 KalamariKing: can we make a functional program
 KalamariKing: in css
 FrancoRoura: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_attr.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_attr.asp</a>
 Lucky30_: nevermind
 KalamariKing: coward
 Lucky30_: never nevermind
 FrancoRoura: You'll need HTML too, so I don't think CSS-only would do
 Lucky30_: lets do it
 KalamariKing: YES lets go
 Lucky30_: what should we do first
 KalamariKing: alright, someone come up with a simple project, like a hello world but a bit harder
 Lucky30_: look for existing solutions on google
 Lucky30_: so you are planning to display hello_world using just css and some element..
 KalamariKing: yes
 Lucky30_: easy
 KalamariKing: as a proof of concept
 KalamariKing: and then go harder, like a user-input two numbers and output the sum
 Lucky30_: use&#160;::before {content:"hello world"}on something
 Lucky30_: easy
 FrancoRoura: Your program gets an HTML string consisting of a paragraph with a certain height, return a css string that will increase it's height by one
 KalamariKing: yeah, thats why i said "a bit harder" -- `content` is too easy
 FrancoRoura: Although anyone could just do a template string 
 Lucky30_: content: calc(attr("a")+attr("b"))
 KalamariKing: but how do you get a and b
 Lucky30_: what else can you do beside content
 KalamariKing: and can we make it a functional calculator, with buttons and everything
 Lucky30_: 
 Lucky30_: not sure
 Lucky30_: probably
 KalamariKing: is there a logical break?
 Lucky30_: since we have event like hover and click i guess we could try
 Lucky30_: nop
 KalamariKing: is there a workaround, with e.g. detecting if a value is negative
 Lucky30_: as far as i can tell, we are limited on one content by element..
 Lucky30_: you are asking the wrong guy
 Lucky30_: try finding an expert
 KalamariKing: alright help me think, two css noobs learning to program
 Lucky30_: hhhh
 KalamariKing: take 1+2
 KalamariKing: well
 KalamariKing: take 1+2==3
 Lucky30_: you mean two css noobs trying to make the impossible
 KalamariKing: yeah lol
 KalamariKing: ok take nothing
 KalamariKing: try this again
 KalamariKing: checking variables? take x==3
 KalamariKing: set a div's height to x, and use css selectors to test for any divs with height 3
 Lucky30_: we cant change the attributes of an element using just css
 wye: how do i do this
 wye: its so hard
 KalamariKing: how do you do what
 wye: all of it 
 wye: i just found the website today
 Lucky30_: try googling
 Lucky30_: ow
 Lucky30_: you mean what to do on codingame
 wye: yeah
 KalamariKing: this site isn't for beginners, its more for practice and competitions for seasoned programmers
 Lucky30_: go to Activities&gt;Practice&gt;easy
 wye: alr thanks
 KalamariKing: and noobs trying to use a non-language (e.g. css) as a language (e.g. build a calculator)
 FrancoRoura: @wye You will see that each challenge requires a set of skills
 Lucky30_:  style sheet language?
 FrancoRoura: IE this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/breach</a> requires five, 3 bronze, 1 silver, 1 gold
 Lucky30_: guys KalamariKing made a mistake 
 Lucky30_: oOOOOO
 Lucky30_: congrats
 Lucky30_: your soul is next
 FrancoRoura: Try to find challenges that require only 1 bronze skill and click the name of the skill to learn about it
 KalamariKing: the dark has already taken my soul
 Lucky30_: hhhhhh
 KalamariKing: my job is to spread the darkness
 Lucky30_: at least i am not the only one
 KalamariKing: alr bois gotta dip, the css calls me
 Lucky30_: damn, no typos 
 SLAY3R: hey
 Lucky30_: hi
 KalamariKing: hello there SLAY3R!
 SLAY3R: im new to this website is clash of code the only online competition?
 AllYourTrees: is there a blog post or forum post about how to encode NN weights into a string? i know recurse mentioned using base64 but does that mean you have to include the base64 algorithm in your code too?
 kovi: is there something with servers?leaderboard is not updated and i experience weird timeouts
 KalamariKing: wow a lot of questions
 Lucky30_: SLAY3R nop, check Activities&gt;compete 
 KalamariKing: SLAY3R there are other competitions, like bot programming and code golf
 Lucky30_: Food should not be allowed to speak
 KalamariKing: AllYourTrees I'm not too sure, I think you turn it into base64 unicode or smth and then paste it in. then you need the decode base64 in cg
 RoboStac: AllYourTrees - yes, you need to include the decoder in your code. You want a unicode system instead of base 64 (can get 14/15 bits per character instead of 6)
 KalamariKing: kovi I don't think so
 KalamariKing: Lucky30_ if food should not be allowed to speak then why are you talking
 darkhorse64: kovi, yes, I just made progress with CG sponsored challenge and leaderboard is not updating
 Lucky30_: i dont have a soul anymore, so nothing to eat here..
 AllYourTrees: okay ty!
 jacek: base65536 eh?
 AllYourTrees: anyone know a simple reference implementation of utf-8 decoding?&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: wow, robo is storming the C4 lb and gave me #1. Time to screenshot
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536">https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536</a> &lt;-- I use that
 AllYourTrees: ty robo!
 RoboStac: yeah, your bot seems to be somehow immune to me&#160;:(
 jacek: darkhorse64 you mean MSmits need to expand his book?
 jacek: RoboStac CNN?
 darkhorse64: You found a hole in MSmits book
 King_Coda: Hello
 RoboStac: yeah
 jacek: one day i will learn CNN ~
 darkhorse64: no book, no hole
 King_Coda: Can you all see this?
 King_Coda: test
 RoboStac: just make sure to test it on nonsquare boards before wasting hours trying to play a rectangular game
 darkhorse64: :sweat_smile:

 jrke: average is crossing 0.4 checkpoints
 King_Coda: I thought my chat was bugged out
 jacek: oO
 King_Coda: KalamariKing can you see my pm's that i'm sending you?
 kovi: yes, it seems that some servers timeout heavily (i have used the old code which run wo. timeouts whole day yesterday)
 KalamariKing: who wants to cry with me
 RoboStac: I've not seen any timeout issue but the ranking updates are acting very weird (eg c4 leaderboard has jumped back in time to show me at 83% complete)
 jacek: just wait for friday to deploy a fix
 KalamariKing: to all who are interested, the CSS-project has an update: css has math functions<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions</a>
 jacek: is CSS turing complete
 KalamariKing: to all who weren't present when the project was introduced: I sent out a challenge, to make a functional addition program in css. Two inputs, one output
 KalamariKing: jacek I'm not sure but I hope so
 King_Coda: Is CSS an assembly language?
 KalamariKing: a what
 AllYourTrees: when will CSS be a valid choice for codingame bots?
 KalamariKing: css is cascading style sheets
 KalamariKing: its what makes your websites look pretty
 KalamariKing: this HAS to be a thing, someday
 Lucky30_: a css function wow
 KalamariKing: CSS + HTML IS TURING COMPLETE
 King_Coda: That's suprising
 KalamariKing: this is happening
 King_Coda: HTML barely even constitutes as a language
 KalamariKing: #bringcsstocg
 KalamariKing: I wanna be first in a css botfight, I'll be expecting css as a language on the next contest
 jrke: does css also support input and output?
 King_Coda: If you want CSS on CG you need to add HTML first
 King_Coda: Logical progression
 jacek: is HTML programming language
 struct: ah yes
 King_Coda: Ehhhhh
 King_Coda: HTML is markup i think
 King_Coda: The only thing I've "coded" in HTML is a snake clone
 jrke: hyper text marup language
 struct: its oop
 jrke: even full form sayes its markup
 struct: form must be wrong
 Lucky30_: hyper text markup language
 Lucky30_: *hypertext
 King_Coda: You can kinda code things in html, but it's not really coding
 Uljahn: fascinating
 King_Coda: HTML's ability to store and change variables is... questionable
 cw477: HTML is best programming language
 King_Coda: Yes
 FrancoRoura: I prefer MD but okay
 Lucky30_: ok guys lets kick them both
 cw477: Lol
 cw477: nah i take it back, JSON is best coding language
 King_Coda: NAH dude, mp3 is the best
 Lucky30_: KalamariKing the whole list of css function <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://css-tricks.com/complete-guide-to-css-functions/">https://css-tricks.com/complete-guide-to-css-functions/</a>
 cw477: lol
 King_Coda: Wav takes up too much memory
 King_Coda: .gp3 is nasty
 FrancoRoura: What about yaml?
 Lucky30_: Morse code maybe
 King_Coda: Morse code= best code language
 FrancoRoura: Unary strings ftw
 FrancoRoura: It's also really simple to learn
 FrancoRoura: For each byte, you hit 1 between 0 and 255 times, which is really helpful cause you can code with only 2 buttons
 Lucky30_: what about a facial-recognitions wink left as 1 and right as 0
 Lucky30_: wink language

 FrancoRoura: Whenever they say Vue, Kubernetes, Graphql, ORM, Phoenix or hashmap you just dive into it until you feel profficient 
 struct: Just run if they ask you to use a language that is discontinued
 jacek: just randomly say blockchain and youll be the new CEO
 FrancoRoura: That's a blockchain idea
 Lucky30_: blockchain it is
 Lucky30_: guys i have been reading this article on blockchaining a blockchain
 Lucky30_: man i am blockchaing much better now hhh
 Lucky30_: is that enough blockchain for you
 Lucky30_: ceo at last
 Lucky30_: if KalamariKing was here, he would blockchain the hell out of me
 Lucky30_: probably reading some css madness
 jacek: blockchain made in css
 Lucky30_: cant copy paste some css no more
 Bob23: hmmmmm
 King_Coda: blockchain
 jacek: congratulations. now you're mod on CG
 King_Coda: Eh, moderator was never my thing
 jacek: yeah, they are weird people
 King_Coda: To many responsibilities, I just wanna code
 King_Coda: Also everybody freaks out whenever you get into chat if you're a mod, I don't wanna do that
 King_Coda: Moderators are people too, despite (some of) their toxicity
 jacek: oO
 King_Coda: *Looks at r3Curse*
 King_Coda: (replace 3 with e, i dont want to ping)
 Astrobytes: Weird eh
 jacek: :scream:
 King_Coda: Long time no see Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I've been resting elsewhere
 King_Coda: Same here. I'm 5,240th on the site now
 struct: I dont remember him being toxic
 struct: I only saw him speeking the truth
 King_Coda: Probably be top 5,000 after I do some CoC's
 struct: hypersonic didnt give you points?
 King_Coda: Been learning Java, JavaScript, C#, and C++
 Astrobytes: I would try to focus one at a time if I were you.
 King_Coda: Yeah, I'm trying to focus on Java at the moment. 
 Astrobytes: Do a little bit of another from time to time
 jacek: if you focus on javascript, youll get java and script at the same time [smart]
 King_Coda: Java and C# have some similar syntax in the way they handle variables, so I'm focusing on Java rn
 King_Coda: That way I can segue into C# easily, then C++
 King_Coda: jacek :rofl:
 Astrobytes: What's with your profile King_Coda? It says you have loads of points but they don't show up under your Bot Programming?
 Astrobytes: *the games that provide the points (CP) don't show up
 struct: he got top 100 in 1 submit maybe it broke the system
 Astrobytes: Top 100? 1 submit?
 struct: hs
 Astrobytes: oh come on, not another Sayonara bot
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Jeez.
 Astrobytes: Grim.
 jacek: he said top 100 in 1 submit or delete.
 jacek: he didnt want to take chances
 JimmyJams: King focus on c#
 JimmyJams: then javascript
 MACKEYTH: Sayonara bot?
 Bob23: sayonara
 darkhorse64: a copy/paste of a Hypersonic top bot that says sayonara

 Di_Masta: Hi, I'm trying to run a game referee on my machine, I've packaged the referee to jar file using Maven.The 2 players are 2 .exe files, build in Release using Viasual Studio(MSVC), from simple C++ file containing the default CG code for the bots.The referee keeps crashing with the "java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError" exception on the first game. I tried a couple of game.Does anyone know what could be the reason?
 FrancoRoura: Hard to know without the source code, try stack overflow
 Di_Masta: I've tried, but with no success, maybe I have to build the referee and debug it
 jacek: that is too specific for CG for stack overlow :v
 struct: which referee are you trying to use?
 Di_Masta: the one for UTT and Spring Challenge 2021
 struct: you are using brutaltester?
 Di_Masta: yeap, I'm trying
 struct: ah dont think it works like that

 Di_Masta: the C++ code is really simple 
 Di_Masta: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/78TqY63.png">https://i.imgur.com/78TqY63.png</a>
 Di_Masta: jdk-16.0.1
 AllYourTrees: so for serializing NN weights, do you first transform the floats into 4 bytes, and then encode the list of bytes into a base65536 string?
 struct: Can you also paste the command here?
 struct: or pm
 Di_Masta: ok, just a moment
 AllYourTrees: cause either i made the NN too big, or am doing something else wrong, i get a huge string lol
 AllYourTrees: get the submitted code is too big error
 jacek: how many chars or bytes
 DrGates: hello guys. is this possible to enter only easy tasks? for beginners? 
 jacek: you change weights into int16
 jacek: DrGates there is easy section of puzzles
 DrGates: I want to play Clash of Code, its good, but sometimes its way too hard for me 
 jacek: no time limit
 DrGates: its not about the time limit, 15 minutes is good and I want it as a race, just talking about the task itself :D
 Astrobytes: Easy puzzles are like clashes without a time limit and (mostly) better problems.
 DrGates: where can i find that?
 AllYourTrees: jacek as in chop off half of the bits of the float?
 Astrobytes: Activities-&gt;Practice
 DrGates: ty
 Astrobytes: Then Classic Puzzle - Easy
 jacek: AllYourTrees somewhat. or float16. the decreased precision isnt much issue, ~15 bits if sufficient for most things (I do)
 AllYourTrees: jacek cool ty
 jacek: i use my own shit isntead of base65535 and the like so YMMV
 Bob23: Nice
 erinc-emre: what is your favorite game type?
 erinc-emre: @all
 Astrobytes: Bot Programming
 jacek: clash ~
 Uljahn: opti
 MSmits: whats that game called where you lurk all day to not miss any jacek memes
 Uljahn: btw for 2048 opti i used bz2 compression for base65535 decoder and encoded it with base85, while hardcoded solutions are pickled, lzma-compressed and base65535 encoded, python batteries are great :hugging:
 MSmits: pickled?
 Uljahn: serialized with pickle module
 MSmits: i see
 jacek: MSmits :notebook: :soccer:&#160;?
 MSmits: I prefer the memes tbh, but sure, some day&#160;:)
 MSmits: I saw you put the C4 memes in the forum thread hehe
 Bob23: hmmmm
 AllYourTrees: i wonder how they came up with the name pickle for python serialization
 AllYourTrees: like oh i'm saving this data to disk, thats definitely the same as soaking it in vinegar and spices for the purposes of eating it later
 AllYourTrees: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Presumably because they're preserved data?
 Astrobytes: Pickling is, after all, a method of preservation
 AllYourTrees: wow yeah actually nice one
 jacek: :cucumber:
 Uljahn: :pickle_rick:
 geppoz: there is some problem on CG platform?
 Uljahn: ye
 geppoz: impossibile to submit, 504
 Uljahn: got that too

 jacek: oO
 Nerchio: i must have submitted too many times to vindinium
 Nerchio: :sweat_smile:
 CodyDataBanks: aye
 Astrobytes: back now
 jacek: oh my
 r31415: Hmm, did someone commit to production w/o testing? On a programming-learning-platform?&#160;;)
 jacek: impossibru. that happens only on fridays
 Astrobytes: No. That only happens on Fridays
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: slowbytes
 Astrobytes: Hey, I'm out of practice
 MACKEYTH: Is CoC borked for everyone?
 FrancoRoura: Are the clash of code servers broken?
 FrancoRoura: Maybe it's just our clash @Mackeyth
 Astrobytes: We've just had a server issue so give it a few minutes
 FrancoRoura: Oh ok, thanks!
 derjack: are clashes broken?
 Astrobytes: shut up pony :P
 derjack:&#160;:(
 Nerchio: is life broken?
 Smelty: yes

 Astrobytes: Don't click. It'll be a rickroll
 Nerchio: I need CoC right now!!
 jacek: 504 returned
 Astrobytes: still working on my end, for now at least
 Nerchio: but is it though
 FrancoRoura: Not for me
 FrancoRoura: The startClashByHandle endpoint does return a 204 though
 FrancoRoura: It just doesn't start them
 Nerchio: maybe we got banned
 FrancoRoura: Hey Astro, quick question, why Angular?
 Astrobytes: Hey I don't work for them, just a mod
 MSmits: saved by a YT add
 MSmits: your rickroll was foiled!!!

 Butanium: I implemented the "smarter" playout MSmits
 Butanium: can't wait to see how it does
 yaboiikevin: clashes broken or is it just me
 Butanium: deploy in multiplayer seems broken at leas
 Tuo: very broken
 Astrobytes: There are issues currently, not just clashes.
 Tuo: im resorting to code golf to satisfy my clash habit&#160;:(
 Tuo:&#160;:(
 Tuo: emotes not showing up also hehe
 Astrobytes: Get a new habit. 
 Butanium: '-'
 Hakimm: still note working
 Hakimm:&#160;?
 Nerchio: no, sadge
 Nerchio: :unamused:
 Butanium: sadge
 Butanium: it's 23h in france
 Nerchio: yeah probably not going to work today
 Nerchio: my guess
 Butanium: I don't know if they will be able to fix it this evening x)
 Butanium:&#160;;-;
 Astrobytes: Hey, look, it's not the end of the world
 Butanium: yup
 Butanium: I'll code my local connect 4 to play agains my bot
 Butanium: x)
 Astrobytes: why is everyone on C4 all of a sudden?
 Astrobytes: Oh, potw, my bad
 Butanium: that was a good game to try a MCTS
 darkhorse64: I'll stay #1 tonight :yum:. Great RPS effect, MSmits wrecks me, get wrecked by robostac which I wrecked
 Butanium: my spring challenge MCTS was too buggy
 Astrobytes: lol nice
 Butanium: So I wanted to start with something easier
 darkhorse64: Next, get legend at UTTT
 Astrobytes: My c4 bot is broken. I stopped working on it at some point then did something else. Should probably get around to fixing it
 Astrobytes: One day.
 Pengwin: is clash of code broken?
 Pengwin: Or am i doing something wrong
 nikim017: this is the fourth time and nothing
 MSmits: heh yeah, i checked two games vs robostac yesterday. They were completely identical
 MSmits: and I dont even have a counterbook. Just a regular opening book
 MSmits: so yeah major rps&#160;:)
 Lucky30_: welcome back
 Tonelllo: Yes, clash of code is broken
 Butanium: what is UTTT?
 Astrobytes: Ultimate tictactoe
 Butanium: thanks
 Astrobytes: 9 tic tac toe boards as a tic tac toe board

 JimmyJams: when does the puzzle of the week reset? Monday?
 Astrobytes: Monday night, French time yeah
 Astrobytes: Well, the update happens earlier but the notification happens then
 JimmyJams: gotchya thx
 JimmyJams: clash of code is down I guess? No games seem to start.
 Astrobytes: Yep. There are issues currently. Not gonna be fixed until  much later though, it's almost midnight in France
 DUNKEN: Sob Sob
 Astrobytes: anyway, laters
 napan: why the arena is not working?
 Nerchio: the site is semi-down currently
 Nerchio: dont expec 
 YoloTheBear: I hate recursion
 ChiliCheese: why that
 JimmyJams: he didn't ilke the movie inception
 JimmyJams: anyone knows what the difference is between the rank like "10030th" you see on your profile and the rank you see in teh "following progress" page of say, your friends list?

 Wontonimo: brutal loss
 HalfLegend: that's where I'm at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/561818051">https://www.codingame.com/replay/561818051</a>
 HalfLegend: lmao
 Wontonimo: what algo are you using?
 HalfLegend: Minimax but my evaluation function is the issue I think
 Wontonimo: submit your bot, let's see it on the leaderboard
 Wontonimo: how deep is your minimax able to go?
 HalfLegend: I had set it up to 0 depth for debug purpose but I made it work up to 2
 Wontonimo: your move, their move, your move, their move?  2 plys?
 Wontonimo: so 4 moves?
 HalfLegend: I think 3 moves: 2,1 and 0 of depth so my turn their turn my turn
 HalfLegend: my bot is submitting
 Wontonimo: what's your eval function?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mine is depth 2...me then them, so u should beat mine, rank 80
 HalfLegend: My eval is +5 points for 2 chip on a same row / column / diagonal without enemy chip; +10 for 3 and then -50 when the enemy has 3 unblocked chip
 Nzk: clash stil down?
 Wontonimo: interesting.  Where did you get those values or did you make them up?
 Wontonimo: workers don't get in till tomorrow morning, so probably will be down till then Nzk
 Nzk: i see
 Nzk: thanks
 HalfLegend: I looked at a youtube video to get ideas for the eval
 Wontonimo: +100 for that!
 Nzk: ooh; lemme try connect 4
 HalfLegend: yeah my bot fight isn't loading 
 Nzk: ooh and imma try this in java too
 Wontonimo: depth 2 doesn't seem like much.  Have you identified any performance bottlenecks?
 HalfLegend: tbh I'm still trying to get the eval right before going in depth.. :joy:
 Wontonimo: if your depth is deep enough the only eval you needs is win/loss
 HalfLegend: fair point haha
 Wontonimo: a lesson from chess, even as far back as deepblue (decades before AlphaGo), if you can go deep enough, win/loss wins over heuristic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my submit was a long time ago, I decided to change format from full gamestates to do/undo ... and i never did
 HalfLegend: I guess if I added pruning on my minimax it might work
 HalfLegend: Isn't there too many possibilites to consider though?
 Nzk: hm
 Wontonimo: even without pruning, if the branching factor is 9 ... let's say you can do 5,000 evals... that would be about a depth of 4
 HalfLegend: Is 4 depth all I need?
 Wontonimo: add pruning and you can usually increase your depth by 50%, so depth 6.
 Wontonimo: all you need for what?
 Nzk: dang replays are also broken
 HalfLegend: For a win/loss
 Wontonimo: oh no, haha, sorry my bad.  depth 4 is what you could get if you can simulate about 5,000 moves
 HalfLegend: I see, thanks. I'll get back on this tommorwo I prolly need to make some deep changes haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: evaling entire board at each node is a waste, checking for win from 1 piece is cheap enough
 Wontonimo: good point
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there are some bitboarding hacks to check for win

 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm working on tryanglecatch at the moment tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: classic connect4 is 7x6...CG's is 9x7, fyi
 nightmarex: how do u submit it lul
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so 63 bits ... doable
 nightmarex: i need puzzle of the week achievement xd
 ja_fica: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/</a>
 ja_fica: thats a perfect play bot
 Wontonimo: cool article PatrickMcGinnisII, thanks for sharing
 ja_fica: I think it is not achievable on a 9x7 but still it is possible to apply an efficient MCTS-solver
 ja_fica: It combines all heuristic properties of any state with minimax where the minimax part speeds up (improves) the true heuristic of the state as you play more rollouts 
 ja_fica: Are battles going to stuck for tonight in UTTT?
 HalfLegend: I just won against the first Boss finally
 HalfLegend: can't submit till they fix the website tho so that's it for tonight
 ja_fica: I was ranking up on UTTT when the matchs were interrupted

 Wontonimo: kinda waiting for vaccine and then summer
 Wontonimo: i hear you were less than 200 steps to a taco shop.  anything else interesting around you, or is it just your house and that one taco place that closed for 100 miles in all directions?
 Westicles: Yeah, summer is nice here.  People are starting to go back to work but the tourists haven't come back, so got the beach to myself
 Wontonimo: ah, a beach!  nice

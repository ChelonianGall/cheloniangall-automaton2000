 TheCuteMonster: hi guys, I'm trying to get the 'Contribution' achievement. So, can you please check out this simple clash of code<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7440af86a345bbedead52d5e6c93c58f47ad">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7440af86a345bbedead52d5e6c93c58f47ad</a>
 Thorcode: ok
 TheCuteMonster: Thank you
 Thorcode: why you put an solution in it
 TheCuteMonster: You mean in the contribution page? I'm supposed to include a working solution. While solving , people won't see the solution
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: why you sent them a solution bro
 Thorcode: are you serious
 Thorcode: anyway I will aprove it
 TheCuteMonster: This is the page for approving a person's contribution. You have to see a solution to approve it. I'm confused
 TheCuteMonster: Alright, thanks
 Thorcode: aproved
 TheCuteMonster: Thanks a lot
 Thorcode: np
 evanforCodin: that's great
 TheCuteMonster: ^_^ you guys are the best
 Thorcode: but you should not put a solution
 TheCuteMonster: really? I must have misunderstood the instructions
 Thorcode: yeah
 Uljahn: "To submit a classic puzzle or CoC puzzle as WIP or Ready, the author must provide a solution to the puzzle, in any language."
 Uljahn: it's in the documentation
 darkhorse64: Approvers must also write a solution and check the test cases. I doubt you did it in just one minute
 darkhorse64: @Thorcode
 derjack: mhm
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: approvers gonna approve
 Automaton2000: don't u wanna try&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Validators and tests are the same, the contrib has very little value, ... -&gt; 250 XP
 darkhorse64: Happy not to clash
 Uljahn: also wording in the statement is far from perfect
 Uljahn: low-effort contribution :shrug:
 TheCuteMonster: hi guys, thank you for the feedback. Its my first contribution. I'll do better next time. I'd be happy to hear how to improve the wording
 darkhorse64: I would not have worded that so kindly :poop:
 darkhorse64: Rather than the contrib itself, it's the approval that irritates me
 TheCuteMonster: Sorry about that, I was too impatient. Wanted people to see puzzle
 Uljahn: TheCuteMonster: "Return the sum of the list." sounds like the sum og the original list
 Uljahn: *of
 TheCuteMonster: oh I see what you mean. Yes, thats true. Thank you
 Uljahn: in the Output section the wording is correct though
 Manjius: Line 1: An integer n for the number of integers.Line 3: Integers of the list
 Manjius: also the problem works fine i tested it
 TheCuteMonster: Nice to see people uphold the quality. 
 Uljahn: i guess making contributions should decrease your XP :smiley:
 _NikJ: Why is everyone making contributions all of the sudden?
 derjack: gamification :unamused:
 Benji-the-scripter:  
 Benji-the-scripter:  
 Benji-the-scripter: oops that space it lagged
 Uljahn: maybe they could implement contribution points awarded for solving puzzles and later spent on making contributions for total newbs to abstain from farming contribution achievement and XP :thinking:
 Uljahn: also approving a contribution could cost some such points for the same reason
 TheBlueBias: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-contributions-and-moderation/189396">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-contributions-and-moderation/189396</a>
 Uljahn: yeah, well-known "not a priority"
 Westicles: clash guys are very social, they'll downvote and it will be removed
 Westicles: or they will edit
 darkhorse64: It's not the clash itself that matters. With a few fixes, it is as decent as many others. It's the one minute for approval
 JacobTheCoder: :wave_tone2:
 Westicles: only one guy to talk to as far as that goes
 darkhorse64: irrelevant argument
 Westicles: he's taken away mod rights before in similar situations
 struct: tbf the clash is solvable in &lt; 1 minute, but still doesnt make it right
 Manjius: you could say figuring out ambiguous statements is also part of the competition :smirk:, just like irl
 Rasagh: Hi, how can i change the learning language?
 struct: click the name of i
 struct: it*
 struct: should be a dropdown list
 miszu: sanity check for c++ default assignment operator
 miszu: does this code copy all elements of the array x and y?
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11b87507-6c14-4387-aa81-84e0cc70c746">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11b87507-6c14-4387-aa81-84e0cc70c746</a>
 struct: what do you mean by copy?
 TheBlueBias: This code doesn't copy anything.
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1079519e-b9cb-4056-91fd-065f38ede1a7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1079519e-b9cb-4056-91fd-065f38ede1a7</a>
 miszu: the question is in that link but does it copy?
 struct: a = b copies yes
 struct: But arr[N] = {-1}; only makes the first element -1
 struct: despite the size
 miszu: so if I do b.x[0] = 7 it won't change a.x[0] correct?
 struct: nope
 struct: thats correct
 miszu: ok thanks
 miszu: I thought arr[N] = {-1} gives the value of -1 to all of them
 derjack: :upside_down:
 struct: im pretty sure it doesnt
 TheBlueBias: It doesn't.
 derjack: eeyup
 TheBlueBias: Works for 0 though
 miszu: you ar eright
 TheBlueBias: You can use std::fill to do that.
 TheBlueBias: Or a loop of course ^^
 derjack: loops are for noobs
 miszu: by default the array has 0 value or garbage value?
 struct: garbage
 struct: but you can do
 struct: arr[n] = {0};
 struct: and all will become 0
 struct: because you assigned the first value
 miszu: oh right
 miszu: thanks
 KalamariKing: what do you mean garbage values
 eulerscheZahl: reminder: Kotlin Heroes starts in 1h
 KalamariKing: what would happen if you read it
 miszu: you will get a random value KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: interesting
 KalamariKing: is that from the memory the array is covering? "left-over" values, marked for deletion?
 TheBlueBias: Friendly reminder to myself: "Why are you still answering people seeking for help, you dumb? They never listen!"
 miszu: the memory is allocated
 miszu: for your array
 miszu: but if you don't give default value then that part of memory will just contains whatever it was in that memory
 WhereAmEye: simp
 NotGoodatall: Did anyone had a hard program before?
 WhereAmEye: oh sry that was supposed to be for myself
 derjack: oO
 miszu: question about GA. How can I introduce a mutation to an integer that is between 0 and 16 000 let's say
 miszu: say x = 5000
 miszu: how you mutate that number
 Astrobytes: Add a random number to it, within a predefined range, e.g. -100 to 100
 NotGoodatall: Im nine
 Astrobytes: No one cares.
 TheBlueBias: Pedobear cares.
 NotGoodatall: No one cares that you don't care
 TheBlueBias: Astrofight
 Astrobytes: hmm... nope.
 TheBlueBias: Meh...
 <b>**TheBlueBias put back his :popcorn:.</b>
 NotGoodatall: :neutral_face:
 NotGoodatall: Who still use loops
 TheBlueBias: Programmers?
 NotGoodatall: yes

 Astrobytes: Why are you posting the entire puzzle description page?
 NotGoodatall: idk
 Astrobytes: Talk sense, do a puzzle, or continue talking trash and get a kick
 NotGoodatall: ok
 NotGoodatall: i got kick on my other account for spamming 
 Astrobytes: then we can skip directly to a ban if you put a word wrong
 NotGoodatall: Ok
 NotGoodatall: Can i join someone group for the fall Challenge 2021
 miszu: thanks Astrobytes for the suggestion
 Astrobytes: miszu: also, think in terms of binary, say you have 1101 1111, mutate one bit, 1100 1111
 miszu: yeah but my number is capped
 Astrobytes: hence the need for a range
 Astrobytes: generate some random value (bigger than the max range of your cap) then clamp it between -range and range 
 miszu: yeah it makes sense
 miszu: for cvz, do you only use x and y coordinates as genes?
 Astrobytes: I don't have a GA on cvz, just MC
 miszu: and you finished 30th! damn
 miszu: I did mcts and finished 510. But that's because I only use a certain sets of coordinates
 miszu: no random moves in the grid

 jacek: yes&#160;:(
 jacek: thx
 jacek: minimax or mcts?
 trictrac: minimax
 Hyperplane: how to play that mode&gt;
 Illedan: How many points are 4 in a row in that game?2 or 1?
 jacek: 2
 jacek: xxxx -&gt; xxx,x + x,xxx
 Illedan: Even this would be a better contest&#160;:(
 miszu: how would you mutate a series of moves that are ints? x1 y1 x2 y2 etc.
 miszu: I am still stuck at that part
 Uljahn: what are x1 y1? i'd use movement increments instead of absolute coords
 UndisclosedTaxidermist_3cbd: mszu
 UndisclosedTaxidermist_3cbd: just sort through the list of coordinates like this
 UndisclosedTaxidermist_3cbd: if end point is x =6 , y =11 (6,11)
 UndisclosedTaxidermist_3cbd: just write a while statement
 UndisclosedTaxidermist_3cbd: for current x and y
 UndisclosedTaxidermist_3cbd: adding or subtracting to get to final destination
 UndisclosedTaxidermist_3cbd: by 1 each turn 
 Astrobytes: miszu: +1 what Uljahn said
 Astrobytes: Same principle I described earlier
 miszu: Uljahn I don't quite understand. So x1 y1 is the coordinate for first move and so on
 miszu: movement increments could be good I guess
 miszu: less overflow
 miszu: Astrobytes which move would you do though?
 Astrobytes: what do you mean?
 TimothyAlexisVass: ٩( ᐛ )وᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
 Astrobytes: thanks Timothy
 TheBlueBias: Discretize x and y and allow mutations only to previous/next x/y
 miszu: I have x1y1x2y2.....xnyn which represents my moves for n turns. Do you mutate all of them? only one move? one coordinates?
 Astrobytes: What blaise said
 TheBlueBias: *Blue
 TheBlueBias: :3
 Astrobytes: :P
 jacek: im blue dabadee~
 Astrobytes: thanks jacek
 TheBlueBias: So 90's
 miszu: TheBlueBias sorry if I sound dumb but could you explain why my approach is not good?
 miszu: GA is new to me
 Astrobytes: take your best n solutions from the last generation and mutate
 miszu: mutate only the next move?
 miszu: also what you mean discretize?
 TheBlueBias: Well on cvz ash has a large shot range so changing x to x+1 will not make any difference. So instead, consider only a set of positions.
 Astrobytes: ^^^^^^^
 TheBlueBias: Close enough to cover all the map, but limited to increase the chance to find a "good move"
 miszu: ok and you mutate just the next move and not the next 5 moves let's say?
 Astrobytes: Do many people use a GA on CvZ? I thought the general meta was flat MC
 darkhorse64: I do
 miszu: darkhorse64 did well so he is a live example it works well
 miszu: and top people use offline to solve it
 Astrobytes: Yeah but some of the fun is doing it online
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: nice, I didn't realise
 miszu: yeah I am doing it online first
 miszu: but should I only mutate first move or first X moves?
 SNEEDSTER: YO IS THIS DERP FROM THE POPULAR MEME DERP?
 darkhorse64: Actually, I am very lucky: my code has a nasty bug that allows me to find a narrow path for a huge gain in one test case. When I fix the code, I reach 400K no more*
 miszu: hardcode your solution for that test case
 Astrobytes: ^ at least to test it out
 jacek: damn i dont get why do i get those timeouts in cttt
 darkhorse64: I did not try hardcoding. There is hardly anything to gain CP wise
 Astrobytes: that's fair
 miszu: Astrobytes you did mcts or GA?
 Illedan: Damn. Why would I need 100 games in wood3 on CTTT -.-
 darkhorse64: Do not complain, I had 200. My games + the boss games
 michalgs: :wave:
 SNEEDSTER: Screw you michalgs
 miszu: SNEEDSTER yeah I am the derp
 SNEEDSTER: awesome!
 Astrobytes: miszu: on CvZ? Flat MC, not MCTS
 Uljahn: there is a problem with finding optimal parameters for GA (population size, mutation rates, selection strategies etc.), so flat MC could be a reasonable starting point (kind of a baseline)
 miszu: flat MC you mean play random moves and hope for the best?
 miszu: if you do it right GA should beat MC in theory
 Astrobytes: Yes, but you can be intelligent about it and use some heuristics
 struct: cvz its strange
 struct: you either have a lucky submit or harcode
 Astrobytes: yeah, I think I maxed out on luck for now, been unable to beat my score so will have to rewrite or hardcode for improvement
 miszu: the solution is probability based
 miszu: I think I had an eureka moment how to improve my code based on all feedbacks
 miszu: going back to my basement
 Astrobytes: hehehe good luck miszu
 miszu: the typical stereotypes is programers live in the basement
 miszu: which is not true obviously
 miszu: we live in our parent's basement
 Astrobytes: Indeed. I live in a tree.
 Astrobytes: The CTTT has a mirror match now, points cumulative?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Astrobytes: thx, will need to write something for it soon
 Astrobytes: and hi :taco:
 Wontonimo: Flat MC got me to Legend in the last competition, so don't knock it
 Wontonimo: (not directed at you Astro.  Thanks for the taco!)
 Astrobytes: I guessed so&#160;:)
 jacek: poor teapot getting rekt
 Wontonimo: where?
 jacek: cttt
 Wontonimo: i'm still stuck in wood3 , because it takes 100 games agains the boss to determine that I should be promoted
 miszu: * test
 miszu: * test *

 jacek: miszu how do you write in red
 Hyperplane: google translate bro
 miszu: jacek by writing your name
 Astrobytes: back in yer box jacek
 darkhorse64: getting rekt with a 100 LOC bot is not surprising but it still wins 100% of the games against Boss2
 Wontonimo: how do you unflip a table?
 Astrobytes: I seldom flip never mind unflip
 Wontonimo: so slow to promote ...
 darkhorse64: will you beat your own boss, Wontonimo&#160;?
 Wontonimo: I'll have to!  
 Wontonimo: as a matter of principle
 Astrobytes: That's your one with the obfuscation right?
 Wontonimo: it obviously has some serious shortcomings if it can be beat with 100 LOC 
 Wontonimo: yes, the one with a very small amount of obfuscation.  just variable renaming.  
 darkhorse64: It happened to me with Othello, only spam submit saved me
 Astrobytes: gotcha, I haven't looked yet
 Astrobytes: hahaha, that was funny with Othello
 Wontonimo: I've gotta figure out that 0ply heuristic that curb stomped my MCTS
 Astrobytes: Is your mcts fully CG-optimized?
 Astrobytes: preallocated nodes etc
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: it's my UTTT code effectively 
 Astrobytes: Hm. Good heuristic!
 Wontonimo: fully bitboarded
 Wontonimo: no heuristic in it&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: What was jacek using? Didn't he mention RAVE or something?
 Astrobytes: (the 0ply heuristic I meant)
 darkhorse64: That made me doubt that MCTS is the way for that game. At least not one with random rollouts
 Wontonimo: yeah, i need smarter rollouts
 Astrobytes: Yeah, looks like alphabeta or EPT to me
 Astrobytes: who's top currently?
 darkhorse64: I am tempted with MM using move ordering with my heuristic
 Wontonimo: MM&#160;?
 Wontonimo: minimax
 darkhorse64: minimax
 Wontonimo: i thought for a sec you meant NN and hit the wrong key
 darkhorse64: M&amp;M
 darkhorse64: how sweet
 Wontonimo: i'm in wood 2 , yeah me
 Wontonimo: it's nice to see there are some people in wood 2
 Astrobytes: Ah, trictrac is top, definitely ab or EPT material here
 darkhorse64: how much is the boss
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: in what terms?
 darkhorse64: its ELO
 Wontonimo: 32.32
 Wontonimo: jrke (#1 spot in w2) is 24.84
 Astrobytes: strange he wrote his bot in python, he uses C++ usually
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/584650005">https://www.codingame.com/replay/584650005</a>Looks like a Vornoi battle :D
 Wontonimo: this is a milestone for me.This is the first bot that I've contributed.  For some reason it really got me in the feels.
 Astrobytes: right on Illedan
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Gratz! Only done one myself I think. Or 2?
 Astrobytes: I think just one.
 Wontonimo: a huge deficiency of this bot is that it is purist in MCTS, in-that it only cares about win/loss.  That means that once it starts to win or lose by a large amount it just doesn't care about score difference.  That isn't the game.  Total score wins

 King007: @bdrnglm Which code?
 Wontonimo: woot, i think i found a better algo for CTTT
 Wontonimo: not in the negatives of Wood1 anymore
 bdrnglm: @King007 this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2002366657422620c03815f5762d84ce2c80060">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2002366657422620c03815f5762d84ce2c80060</a>
 Wontonimo: I will beat the teapot, mark my words
 Manjius: clash of code is like heroin
 King007: @bdrnglm I just shared. I thought it was automatically shared, sorry.
 bdrnglm: @King007 thank you&#160;:)
 King007: You're welcome.
 Wontonimo: more clash of code won't effect your global rank much.  But, playing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/counting-tictactoe</a> will
 Wontonimo: it's pretty easy to get started.  All the legal moves are provided each turn, so at a minimum you could pick one at random until you come up with a strategy
 King007: Thanks for sharing, @Wontonimo.
 Hyperplane: its hard
 Arridian: I will try, though I am very new, so lol
 Thorcode: nice bot Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: thanks Thorcode
 Wontonimo: if you find counting tic tac toe hard, there are a few multis that are a bit easier
 Wontonimo: it's definitely different than clash of code.  It takes hours to get something going instead of minutes.  It is a lot more rewarding to see your creation do stuff and beat other bots though
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: I'm trying coding escape
 Arridian: In the pod race ones, what distance ahead should you let the enemy get before boosting? 
 Thorcode: do you know how to put a wall?
 Arridian: I haven't got that far yet.
 Arridian: Only at the boost part so far.
 Thorcode: which league
 Arridian: wood 1&#160;:) lol
 Thorcode: bruh
 Arridian: It isn't telling me how to progress, so I don't know what to do next
 Arridian: I must be doing something wrong, because it stopped telling me what to do
 Thorcode: try it your self
 Wontonimo: yeah, it doesn't tell you how to solve it
 Wontonimo: you should aim at the checkpoint and increase your thrust to 100
 Wontonimo: then, 
 Thorcode: well I'm helping him a bit logic :grin:
 Wontonimo: oh cool!
 Thorcode: not give him the code
 Matthw: :stuck_out_tongue:
 Thorcode: probably this site is not for learner
 SunEpi: so stupid
 SunEpi: =)))
 SunEpi: find game bro
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 miszu: anyone has a quick method for finding an average of two angle?
 Wontonimo: (a + b) / 2
 miszu: not quite because if you take 359 and 1 degree, the middle is actually just 0
 miszu: so I guess the bisection of two angles
 struct: max(n,359)
 struct: wait
 struct: thats wrong
 struct: is this for cvz miszu?
 Wontonimo: abs(180 - abs(a - b))
 miszu: yeah
 Wontonimo: that's the angle between them
 miszu: so instead of using x,y I will use angle and distance
 miszu: those genes will be better
 miszu: than using x,y
 miszu: a = 0 and b=90 your formula gives me 90 which is not 45
 Wontonimo: i've heard that dx,dy is usually better than x,y for GA
 Wontonimo: ^^ "That's the angle between them"
 Wontonimo: it's not your answer, but it is half way to it
 miszu: ok I see
 miszu: ok yeah makes sense
 miszu: then converting angle to coordinates... sigh
 miszu: at least GA will be much better
 miszu: should I simply generate an angle between 0 to 360 or 0 to 2pi right away?
 miszu: I will use degrees right away
 SunEpi: reference in js not compare == object, so sad&#160;:&gt;

 Astrobytes: No, still alphabeta with ID

 Astrobytes: I have that! Not those weights though&#160;;)
 Kayd33n: Bonjour, j'ai un DM à faire en VBA mais je ne comprend rien, quelqu'un pourrait-il m'apporter de l'aide je vous prie?
 Astrobytes: :flag_fr: #fr
 Hjax: good morning 
 Astrobytes: hi Hjax
 jacek: hey jude
 Astrobytes: Don't make it bad
 jacek: you dont like that song?
 Astrobytes: It's the first line of it after "Hey Jude" :P
 jacek: ah for a moment i though you were german
 Astrobytes: oh dear
 Hjax: im always surprised how few americans i see on this site
 Hjax: lots of europeans 
 Astrobytes: There's a fair few around, but more Europeans (especially French, what with CG being French and all :D )
 Hjax: yeah tons of french people
 jacek: well its a french website
 darkhorse64: Fortunately, some of them can speak english
 Hjax: sure, but i would expect a site like this to have pretty universal appeal among programmers 
 Hjax: regardless of what language you speak 
 AndiWawank: Hello 
 Hjax: hi there :D
 Astrobytes: Maybe just not heard of it? 
 Hjax: i was turned off from this site for years because i didnt like the UI
 darkhorse64: Maybe CG is not well known outside France
 Hjax: technically i submitted something to PR1, but i didnt give a contest a serious attempt until UTG 
 Astrobytes: The older site was a bit of a mess yeah
 Astrobytes: I joined 2015, but didn't do contest until Code Royale
 darkhorse64: End of 2018 for me
 darkhorse64: I did not even imagine such a thing could exist
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I really love the bot programming, CG does it better than anyone else ever has
 Hjax: halite was pretty good 
 Hjax: although i missed the first two halites, and didnt like the game for halite 3 
 Astrobytes: Never got the chance to participate unfortunately, don't think I'll bother now it's ont Kaggle
 Hjax: but the ui / matchrunning / ranking was excellent 
 Hjax: kaggle cant even get connect 4 right 
 Astrobytes: :d
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: theres been exploits for free wins in their connect 4 game for months 
 Hjax: their platform just doesnt seem suited to bot programming competitions 
 Hjax: i played battlecode in college, the was pretty fun 
 Hjax: that*
 Astrobytes: Yeah they were talking about that on the discord this morning, something about passing the gamestate by reference so you could just declare yourself the winner :D
 Hjax: yeah its silly 
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid thinks they fixed that one
 Astrobytes: I just find their whole platform a bit clunky and awkward tbh
 Hjax: agreed 
 Hjax: codingames ui has improved significantly since i was scared away years ago 
 Hjax: so im happy here now 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's miles better than before
 Hjax: im currently reading through the multis to see if anything jumps out at me 
 struct: halite should have come to CG :D
 Astrobytes: lol, can you imagine
 Hjax: the core of halite was its 24/7 matchrunning though 
 Hjax: codingame is much different 
 Hjax: it would be nice of codingame could do that, but with so many multis it would take an insane amount of compute
 struct: disable everything else 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that would be the holy grail
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 Hjax: right now the leaderboards for old multis are probably inaccurate 
 Hjax: because games are only played with new submissions 
 struct: Halite had sponsors?
 Hjax: it was run by two sigma, an investment firm 
 Hjax: which had plenty of money to pour into cloud capacity to run games
 Hjax: maybe it would be nice to manually trigger a reranking of multis every once in a while 
 struct: I guess running a contest for a 60 bill company is nothing
 Hjax: yeah, im sure their costs were in the 10s of thousands
 Hjax: but they were using it to scout hires 
 Hjax: so it was probably worth the investment 
 Hjax: i feel like theres a a very specific type of multi im good at, and im pretty mediocre at everything else 
 Astrobytes: Well, practice will fix that
 Hjax: the type im good at being grid based games with a good bit of info
 Hjax: eg pr2, utg
 Astrobytes: And you can learn a ton along the way
 Hjax: and im not good at the very limited info games (ooc), the floating point movement games (csb), or the number crunching games (uttt)
 Astrobytes: *im not good... yet
 Hjax: i know how to write mcts / minimax bots in theory 
 Hjax: ive written a few for things outside of this site 
 Hjax: but not in very performant languages 
 Hjax: ive written a connect 4 program and a checkers program in python :D 
 Uljahn: btw uttt is the most active multi now when PR2 is over :smirk:
 Astrobytes: It's not that hard to port to C# or even C++ tbh, you can use it as a way to start to learn the language
 Hjax: blame smits 
 Astrobytes: lol
 Uljahn: i blame ru chat
 Hjax: smits is carrying uttt on his shoulders 
 struct: One day Ill make a popular contribution
 struct: One can hope
 Astrobytes: I was gonna say, ru was heavily on UTTT recently
 Hjax: i wrote half of a uttt bot in c++ at one point 
 Astrobytes: You make great board games struct
 Hjax: i couldnt figure out how to structure my search 
 struct: I don't like saying I make them
 struct: I usually say port
 Uljahn: they even wrecked reCur se
 Hjax: in terms of move generation / storing the graph 
 Hjax: oh i see, tomatoes is doing very well 
 Hjax: using rust as well, fun 
 Astrobytes: wow, nice
 struct: C# and rust are still on debug mode on IDE?
 Hjax: tomatoes is pretty new to the site, but is climbing ranks very quickly 
 Astrobytes: Think so struct
 tomatoes: rust still debug, c# don't know
 struct: Can tomatoes have an opening book?
 Hjax: oh i summoned tomatoes, hi there :D
 Astrobytes: grats on your uttt tomatoes
 tomatoes: no book, only teccles as suggestion for search
 struct: Nice
 Hjax: what was teccles trick? play in the same square as the board you are in?
 tomatoes: yes
 Hjax: theres someone in uttt legend with python 3, i wonder if they got there with C and then submitted python as a joke 
 Astrobytes: Yeah it was something like that I believe, not sure of original language
 Hjax: i wonder if its even possible to get legend with python
 Hjax: maybe with a huge book 
 Astrobytes: and making good use of numpy/scipy, possibly
 k4ng0u: also yyou can call c in your python code I think
 Hjax: lol thats cheating 
 k4ng0u: this is what recurse did on bitrunner
 k4ng0u: I think it's forbidden in contests though
 Astrobytes: And CSB, it's a wrapper
 Astrobytes: Yeah, fine for multis
 Hjax: if you wanted to get legend with python, youd still need to write a C++ or similar bot 
 Hjax: for book generation lol 
 Uljahn: or for NN training
 Hjax: are NNs any good at uttt?
 struct: I don't think so
 Hjax: its hard to look at a game state and say who is winning 
 Tuanld: Hello everyone. I'm newbie
 Hjax: welcome!
 struct: I think re curse tried and said it was not a success
 reCurse: uttt is not a success so there's that
 Astrobytes: Nice Agade
 samkruger: hi guys i think i didint understand the problem well
 samkruger: :joy:
 dbdr: Astrobytes: ag*de where?
 Astrobytes: Oware
 Astrobytes: 2nd place

 eulerscheZahl: ping struct now i am
 jacek: Automaton2000 is it true?
 Automaton2000: i think that's what it looks like c#
 OiYouYeahYou: How do I get rid of this chat window?
 jacek: triangle at the bottom
 eulerscheZahl: how did you even get the chat window?
 eulerscheZahl: you are level2, should not appear before 3
 Scarfield: there was a lvl 1 typing the other day as well
 jacek: premum CG
 OiYouYeahYou: How do I unsubscribe from this chat UX overall?
 eulerscheZahl: possible with external clients
 eulerscheZahl: does ?disableChat in the URL work again?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 Astrobytes: I reported it but it was never acknowledged nvm fixed
 Hjax: why would you want to get rid of the chat window though, isnt this a social networking site where we complain about UTTT?
 reCurse: I could ban
 reCurse: :P
 jacek: yeah, just invite reBless to clash
 Astrobytes: And menace each other with threats of clashes
 Hjax: just saying your distaste for uttt is well documented :P
 eulerscheZahl: ban still shows the chat, you can't type i think
 eulerscheZahl: at least that's what i saw when i got kicked
 reCurse: I thought that was kick
 Scarfield: jace-k voluntered to test it
 reCurse: Can't see anything when banned or so I think
 eulerscheZahl: bans are only active till the chatserver restarts
 eulerscheZahl: so who volunteers?
 reCurse: Well it's also per channel
 eulerscheZahl: definitely won't hide the chat completely. you get funny messages after banning someone
 reCurse: We could just join a test one and ban you there
 eulerscheZahl: #ban_me_here
 Scarfield: xD
 reCurse: And?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/t1l7rx">https://prnt.sc/t1l7rx</a>
 eulerscheZahl: type again if i still see it
 reCurse: I wrote more stuff
 eulerscheZahl: "Go" is the last i can see
 reCurse: Ok
 reCurse: So you can't see new stuff
 reCurse: Try refreshing?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/t1l8j0">https://prnt.sc/t1l8j0</a>
 reCurse: Cool
 reCurse: Well it's good you can't see I said very mean stuff about you
 eulerscheZahl: i can still ask other users
 reCurse: :o
 jacek: indeed
 Astrobytes: Terrible, terrible things euler
 eulerscheZahl: a CoC invite?
 Astrobytes: Called you a frog and everything
 Scarfield: said something about your cat as well :o
 eulerscheZahl: she's on top of me right now
 dbdr: now we have a place where we can freely talk about euler&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that was my first ban on CG
 eulerscheZahl: 1 kick from MK before
 Hjax: im sure youll cherish the moment forever 
 jistjoalal: if u thought ppl get sweaty about video games... wait until you see clash of code
 struct: sweaty?
 jistjoalal: exerting excessive effort for imaginary victory
 Reksio: Hi All. Does anyone know if puzzles run on multi-core processors and we actually have access to all cores? What do puzzles actually run on, is it AWS Lambda or Azure Function, container or something else?
 Snef: only one core iirc
 Reksio: So the faq info saying !Your program is compiled and run in a Linux environment on a 64bit multi-core architecture. " is just about processor type but we have access only to one core.
 Reksio: Thanks
 Reksio: do you know if C# puzzles's solutions we submit are compiled in release mode (Optimize flag on) or debug? They only said they compile with unsafe flag so I'm not 100% sure.
 Snef: idk
 Astrobytes: Yeah release I think, it's debug in the IDE for C# and Rust I believe
 roddux: see if you can read from /proc and check yourself&#160;:^)
 Astrobytes: You can
 Reksio: But there are differences of how code is compiled before and after submit
 Astrobytes: Yes, debug mode in IDE, release for submit (C#, Rust)
 Reksio: And in both cases just one physical thread
 Astrobytes: Yup.
 rahul_t37: Ha
 Reksio: Thanks. This simplifies things a lot
 Astrobytes: Cool, no worries

 eulerscheZahl: i just realized that black starts
 struct: :p
 eulerscheZahl: struct is breaking with all conventions here
 struct: Initialy it was white
 struct: but someone said
 struct: that black starts
 eulerscheZahl: black players matter
 struct: blame jacek
 jacek: yes
 jacek: and start position was inverted
 eulerscheZahl: and that's how the riots reached CG
 jacek: and there were chains
 eulerscheZahl: there are no more chain flips?
 jacek: tats slavery
 Astrobytes: Black does start
 Astrobytes: That was a nice submit
 Astrobytes: Only 10.44 points behind tric now&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: well, 10.something
 eulerscheZahl: in that range even a loss can pull him down a bit
 Astrobytes: I pulled him down with one victory
 jacek: a loss always can pull down
 Astrobytes: What happened to k4ng0u's bot? Was top 10 earlier, now on the bottom?
 Astrobytes: woops, sorry for the ping
 jacek: maybe its alt
 Astrobytes: No that's his main account
 eulerscheZahl: but why should he break is main account for an alt?
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: i still remember this quote of him:"while […] C# users are often more casual (or even beginners)."
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Was in one of the last contest PMs right

 eulerscheZahl: jeez, who made that web design?
 eulerscheZahl: even my herokuapp looks better
 Astrobytes: Hey that's classic late 90s/early 00's design there. History.
 eulerscheZahl: takes about 1/5th of by screen horizontally
 struct: built for vertical screens
 eulerscheZahl: my monitor has pivot :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i think i used it once in 8 years
 Astrobytes: Look, stop ragging on it 'cause it's from The Olden Days :P

 Astrobytes: Yeah, that was funny. It had every cheesy 90's web 'feature'
 eulerscheZahl: can't see it in the video but i could swear i saw a unicorn back then
 eulerscheZahl: in the background
 k4ng0u: Astrobytes on othello I upgraded my code from a 64 boolean array to a buggy unsigned long long structure. hehe
 eulerscheZahl: well done
 eulerscheZahl: not performing better but i'm pretty sure it's faster now
 darkhorse64: "true bitboard"
 k4ng0u: 20 times more rollouts (though probably 100% of them don't go to a real end game state)
 struct: I need to start doing these types of UIs for multis
 Astrobytes:  Ah lol :D
 MPSI_LIV_CronierDamiano: hey guys 
 MPSI_LIV_CronierDamiano: is there some guys who master the caml language by any chance&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: like Ocaml? sounds like a job for Boulet
 MPSI_LIV_CronierDamiano: yeah but i don't have the choice, its the program in my shcool 
 eulerscheZahl: you have higher chances to find him on #fr

 struct: Forgot to add no more legal moves on game summary
 struct:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, I think it's fairly obvious :D
 Astrobytes: Ouch, I have a bug.
 Astrobytes: (nothing to do with the replay, just had a screen break)
 struct: I'm uploading
 Astrobytes: fair enough&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Patch Ninja
 struct: What bug do you have?
 k4ng0u: do you guys go for minmax or mcts for othello? my sim is so slow (around 200 rollouts...) that it feels like mcts is really weak in early game
 Astrobytes: Had a wrong value in the right place
 struct: 200?
 struct: seems extremely lo
 struct: low*
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 has about 80,000 I believe
 jacek: im using minimax
 Astrobytes: I'm using minimax also
 trictrac: me too
 struct: wasnt it 8 mill?
 jacek: he said he gets 80k in 150ms
 struct: ah ok 80k
 struct: my bad
 jacek: while i could (on my cpu) do 8k a second
 jacek: :s
 Defflex: what r u guys talking about&#160;?
 jacek: othello game
 Astrobytes: Search algorithms for Othello
 Astrobytes: k4ng0u bitboards?
 Defflex: ahh
 k4ng0u: haha no wonder I lose constantly :D
 struct: 9 passes 
 struct:  damn
 k4ng0u: given the size of the board and the symetry, I guess an opening book can take give you a great advantage as well
 k4ng0u: I was previously using 2 64 boolean arrays and am trying to migrate to 64bits bitboards
 Astrobytes: Ah yes, I forgot you mentioned earlier
 jacek: bitboard array&#160;:?
 Astrobytes: Pruneboard jacek

 Iboss15: hi

 Astrobytes: hye
 k4ng0u: I am quite new to c++ and took some pragma from here and there, but it would seem that my code randomly fails because of pragma GCC optimize("inline") is there a way to find out why or a list of "classic" classic code patterns that are incompatible with this pragma?
 Iboss15: I know Python
 RoboStac: all defined code will work properly with inline, the most likely thing is you are doing something undefined (out of bounds access, function that doesn't return when it should etc) that just happens to work when its not inline
 jacek: inline souldnt break things
 k4ng0u: thanks RoboStac and jacek, I had the feeling my code wasn't very clean anyway, I will check what might be wrong
 Astrobytes: hey RockyMullet&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Ah, not online, just submitting
 darkhorse64: jacek on fire
 Astrobytes: wow, yeah
 jacek: lucky resubmit
 Astrobytes: Pretty good luck!
 Astrobytes: Anyway, see you all tomorrow

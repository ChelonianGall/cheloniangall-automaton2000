 derjack: Automaton2000 w00t
 Automaton2000: you need to use a library for nn
 derjack: no i dont :x
 Mr_BlueBird: really?
 Saad-py: heyo wsp guys
 DaNinja: if Automaton2000 says so then it must be true
 Automaton2000: why is it the same way
 Mr_BlueBird: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/694621d56adfadb798c336732e297617123a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/694621d56adfadb798c336732e297617123a</a>
 Mr_BlueBird: please click this link to see my contribution
 IvesL: you cant force people not to use certain methods here
 Mr_BlueBird: i correct it
 Mr_BlueBird: people will learn more algorithms if they use bubble sort algorithm, and almost all can use built-in function for sorting people can't learn if they keep it up using built-in function
 Westicles: that's like the dumbest idea ever
 KiwiTae: Westicles &gt;&lt;
 Mr_BlueBird: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/694621d56adfadb798c336732e297617123a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/694621d56adfadb798c336732e297617123a</a>
 derjack: but you cant inspect into how they do it
 derjack: either by bubble sort, builtin sort, or hardcoded print
 derjack: there is puzzle about making sha256. people normally would use builtin solutions, so the guy changed the constants and everyone has to implement sha256-wannabe themselves
 derjack: you cant do that with sorting
 Westicles: He updated it to copy the previous clash I linked
 [CG]Thibaud: not cool Westicles
 Westicles: Yes, I agree

 Mr_BlueBird: Even or Odd?
 Mr_BlueBird: This one is easy, and correct
 [CG]Thibaud: but why? Mr_BlueBird
 Uljahn: my new contribution: print "hello world"&#160;:)
 Mr_BlueBird: just for fun
 [CG]Thibaud: do you think the clash pool really needs another version of this kind of super easy puzzle?
 [CG]Thibaud: that's the thing, for most players, it's not fun
 Mr_BlueBird: this one is easy
 Mr_BlueBird: you don't like it?
 Mr_BlueBird: you have to just check n is even or not
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah, what's challenging or fun here?
 LouDelpirou: I have a question related to Asteroids easy training please. Are Asteroids able to move in depth, meaning their representation letter would change and that i will have to calculate the in-depth motion too or does that letter represents them at any given time&#160;? 
 Mr_BlueBird: please approve my contribution 
 [CG]Thibaud: did you check the forum thread related to this puzzle LouDelpirou&#160;? There might be the response to your question there (I didn't check)
 LouDelpirou: that seems like the first thing to do sorry ill check

 GarethEddies: cool
 GarethEddies: love Canada
 GarethEddies: the company I work for, its parent company is based in Vancouver Canada

 Wontonimo: I've never been to Australia.  A good friend of mine moved there years ago.  I've been meaning to visit
 GarethEddies: CSI software, have you heard of them&#160;?
 Mr_BlueBird: hi!
 Wontonimo: rings a bell, but I can't place it.

 GarethEddies: no, I have to go
 Wontonimo: later
 Wontonimo: Hi Mr_BlueBird
 Wontonimo: why you sad?
 Mr_BlueBird: by mistale
 Mr_BlueBird: *mistake
 Mr_BlueBird: i send it
 Wontonimo: that's very sad
 mrq0340a:&#160;:'(
 Mr_BlueBird: what happened?
 struct: What did you improve in connect 4 MSmits?
 Xascoria: hello
 derjack: oO
 struct: i had a decent win rate yesterday when i fixed my bug&#160;:(
 struct: I was forgetting switching current player
 struct: before starting the rollout
 struct: so the same player would make 2 moves in a row
 struct:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: and now it looks like MSmits mined your moves and has made counter moves.  6.3 point lead
 MSmits: Wontonimo nope
 MSmits: It's just another 3 days of running meta mcts 
 Wontonimo: hehe
 Wontonimo: that meta mcts is brutally good MSmits&#160;!
 MSmits: I update the book every once in a while. I am only at 10% of code size capacity btw
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ahseeit.com//king-include/uploads/2019/01/50061675_2144288655663538_6930558001217457010_n-6341318478.jpg">https://ahseeit.com//king-include/uploads/2019/01/50061675_2144288655663538_6930558001217457010_n-6341318478.jpg</a>

 Wontonimo: and Shaggy's power doesn't stop at 100% either
 MSmits: how good a book from meta mcts is depends on how good the bot is that it is using to run games and the amount of games it has run. And also how simple the game is. C4 is pretty simple
 Wontonimo: sounds like this book is going to be very good
 MSmits: yeah, i was hoping to just solve the game. That would be a bigger achievement tbh. But not sure that is realistic
 MSmits: all smaller sizes than this have been solved
 Wontonimo: are you even considering an opening move other than 1 &amp; 7&#160;?
 struct: I dont think its needed
 struct: He just needs to steal those
 Wontonimo: or has your meta mcts pretty much determined that is the optimal
 struct: His bot is strong enough
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/PyjefeR">https://imgur.com/a/PyjefeR</a>
 MSmits: I am focusing on move 1. But it really depends on how you define solving
 MSmits: to prove that the CG version is  a draw, I only need to prove move 1/7 is a draw
 MSmits: that's assuming it is
 MSmits: if it's not, i need to prove all starting moves are wins and losses
 MSmits: and then p2 is the winner on perfect play
 MSmits: due to steal
 struct: ill just update my expansion
 struct: I dont know what else to do for this game
 MSmits: i stopped improving after day 1. Except I changed that one function with the loop thanks to you
 DomiKo: ofc NN
 MSmits: and removed static keywords thanks to darkhorse
 struct: static in the avx thing?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: static const
 struct: maybe I was the one who told him that&#160;:)
 MSmits: could be
 struct: DomiKo but my bot is above current NNS
 MSmits: yeah I really would not bother with NN here. You can make a great bot, but for simple games, NN is not better
 Wontonimo: how are you storing the board?  I was thinking __int128.  
 DomiKo: I'm really curious if they will improve
 struct: uint64_t
 Wontonimo: 2 of them?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: jace k and robo
 MSmits: oh you mean two uint64_t
 struct: robo has  a big win rate vs me after I fixed my bug
 Wontonimo: and how do you do shift with 2?  I'm no bit twiddle expert
 struct: You only need to shift 1
 MSmits: i dont do anything on both boards at the same time
 MSmits: you just need to know 1 player or the other
 MSmits: usually the opponent, to see if he can win next turn
 MSmits: well i guess you combine both boards to see which cells are occupied
 MSmits: every once in a while
 MSmits: but that's 1 bit op
 Wontonimo: ah, so you arn't storing padding in your board
 MSmits: no padding for me
 Wontonimo: that's why you can fit it in 64
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: same for struct and darkhorse
 MSmits: actually i havent ever used padding
 Wontonimo: got it
 MSmits: most of the time i need the full 64 bit
 MSmits:  i guess they use it for chess maybe? Or smaller games
 struct: I only did padding for spring challenge
 struct: but board was much smaller
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: people using padding for uttt as well I think
 MSmits: there's some way to organize a TTT board to do win checks
 struct: also im not really an expert on bitboards
 struct: but I came up with stuff for c4 that  Idont really understand
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: what dont you understand?
 struct: The way I update the legal moves mask
 struct: Not the way I generate them
 struct: That one I understand
 struct: But the way I update
 struct: i dont set and clear a bit
 struct: I do something else
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: but how did you come up with it if you dont understand
 struct: trial and error
 MSmits: I see
 StarBoyG: woah there used to be a lot girls here
 StarBoyG: what happeed
 StarBoyG: happened*
 Wontonimo: comments like that
 Wontonimo: i'm guessing
 struct: also I dont need __builtin_ctzll on my bot
 struct: due to this
 Wontonimo: Hey StarBoyG, don't swear at me in private chat.  Not cool
 struct: I kicked him&#160;:/
 derjack: oO
 struct: Now he is pming you ...
 Wontonimo: may have been before the kick
 Wontonimo: it was after my comment.  whatever
 struct: just ignore it I guess
 Wontonimo: np
 Wontonimo: thanks for chatting about the bitboard data size.  Glad to hear it is possible in 64 bits, and it's got me thinking of how to handle the wrap-around issue i was having
 struct: you need masks
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 struct: I have in total 4 different masks
 struct: and this is my board
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/2HBpsMx.png">https://i.imgur.com/2HBpsMx.png</a>
 Wontonimo: wild.  I had mine tilted the other way, column wise instead of row wise
 struct: I feel like this format should be easier
 struct: also you can do

 struct: to get moves
 struct: and to update them is also eas
 struct: easy*
 struct: update mask i mean
 Wontonimo: cool.  it's amazing that such a simple design decision has such important implications
 Wontonimo: if additional wood leagues are made, what happens to the existing bots in the current leagues?
 struct: boss will be sumited to arena and then play all the batles until it stabilizes
 struct: all players above will get promoted
 AllYourTrees: new league for C$?
 AllYourTrees: C4*
 Wontonimo: so, people in wood1 may get demoted to wood2&#160;?
 struct: no
 struct: yes*
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 struct: but one more league will be created
 struct: so wood 2 becomes wood 3, wood 1 becomes wood 2
 mrq0340a: platin diamond master tho
 Wontonimo: i like it!  AshKetchum, more leagues plz!
 derjack: how do you know
 struct: I cant donate this bot
 Wontonimo: Maybe we could ask Smelty, 98th to?
 struct: I was expecting like a top 20 bot
 darkhorse64: I think a bitboarded MC may dowell
 Wontonimo: AllYourTrees, how do you feel about donating your bot?
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: 18th
 darkhorse64: One caveat: multi bots cannot be kept secret
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: well that's no good.
 darkhorse64: I mean thare are ways (that I don't know) to leak them
 darkhorse64: *there*
 struct: also the people that probably know
 struct: wont copy paste them
 darkhorse64: I would not want my MCTS bot to be leaked. For clobber, I wrote a lousy MM bot
 AllYourTrees: Wontonimo for what? sry
 AllYourTrees: for the boss?? :O
 Wontonimo: how about you donate your C4 bot as the Wood2 boss
 AllYourTrees: what goes into donating it?
 darkhorse64: Read chat above
 darkhorse64: just above
 MSmits: darkhorse64 you said: "multi bots cannot be kept secret"
 MSmits: thats confusing
 MSmits: you mean bosses
 Wontonimo: idk to be honest.  You'd have to share your code with someone who adds it to the multi
 Wontonimo: i'm guessing
 darkhorse64: MSmits: true
 AllYourTrees: its a MCTS+NN :thinking:
 AllYourTrees: would i still be allowed to submit other versions?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: bosses should preferably not be heavy search bots and not use the full calc time, but maybe in this case that is not possible
 struct: im sure if my bot uses 10ms it would still be top 10
 struct: let me try
 MSmits: top 10 i doubt, but top 20 sure
 AllYourTrees: :shock:
 Wontonimo: :and awe:
 struct: ill make 100ms first turn and 10ms rest
 Wontonimo: oh, i'm gonna love watching this
 struct: it won vs jacek
 struct: lol
 struct: localy
 AllYourTrees: whats your approach again struct? simd?
 AllYourTrees: smart rollout mcts?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: darkhorse, struct and mine are mostly identical in algorithm. Only difference are implementation details
 MSmits: at least that's what i get from our convo's
 darkhorse64: struct top 15 at 25%
 AllYourTrees: that's pretty crazy
 Wontonimo: wth Struct, go easy on the other bots  lol
 MSmits: well in most multis bot quality goes down fast below top 5 or top 10
 MSmits: most community multies i should say
 derjack: why so low in oware
 MSmits: me?
 derjack: who else is low :v
 MSmits: current version has some rps problems vs marchete
 MSmits: but i am not working on it
 MSmits: marchete joined the 2nd tier NN's
 MSmits: agade and re curse
 MSmits: my bot can generally hold its own vs those quality NNs, but I cant win 100% vs lower ranked players like they mostly can
 MSmits: hard to do that with 9 params overfitted to work against strong bots
 MSmits: Allright, I got 24 hrs to finish my internship report
 MSmits: or I run risk of not beating the deadline if I get vaccination side effevts
 MSmits: effects
 mrq0340a: life is a mysterious thing
 MSmits: smelty is supposed to say "interesting" or "hmm" now
 MSmits: guess he's not here
 mrq0340a: interesting
 MSmits: looks like you were right struct
 Wontonimo: good luck MSmits
 MSmits: thanks
 struct: yeah, also gl
 MSmits: have to write around 2k words 
 MSmits: and add literature and stuff
 struct: rank 5, not bad :p
 MSmits: it's nice
 struct: time to resubmit
 Wontonimo: 37.84, that's about 2.5 points lower.  I'm not exactly sure what that translates to, but my guess is a 70/30 win/loss compared to your 100ms bot.
 struct: my bot is terrible against robo

 Wontonimo: don't spam
 struct: also you need to wait
 eulerscheZahl: why is your contribution more important than the 75 others pending?
 eulerscheZahl: only 76 pending, that's surprisingly low
 eulerscheZahl: 75 if you subtract the eternal troll vs castle
 darkhorse64: The ever farming multi
 OrisRas: im really new to coding, what is the easier way to start to learn?
 JohnCM: try reading a book on the language
 JohnCM: or you could try clash of code and see other ppl's answers and learn from there
 Mr_BlueBird: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hackerearth.com">https://hackerearth.com</a>
 OrisRas: im playing clash now but others answers are vague if i dont know what they are typing
 Mr_BlueBird: here you can learn algorithms
 OrisRas: thanks^^
 Mr_BlueBird: wlcm
 eulerscheZahl: "The ever farming multi"worth more than creating a contest
 struct: 11% win rate vs robo
 struct: this damn NNs
 eulerscheZahl: UTTT?
 struct: Connect 4
 Mr_BlueBird: it's hard
 eulerscheZahl: i see, Oware
 struct: oware is worse  yeah
 struct: but on connect 4 robo bot is very good vs me
 Mr_BlueBird: I tried to win but lost&#160;:(
 derjack: try to lose then
 darkhorse64: I have got a good win rate against robo. RPS effect ...
 struct: I tried to update my expansion
 struct: but was getting memory errors
 struct: Ill need to go back to it
 Wontonimo: a well trained NN has some similarities to opening/closing book, in that the weights effectively are memorizing (hopefully generalizing) good moves.  But it falls down where it hasn't memorized (or hasn't generalized well)
 Marchete: are you vaccinated, MSmits?

 Wontonimo: i got my 1st dose this last weekend
 eulerscheZahl: "this last" is a confusing way to state it :D
 BlaiseEbuth: I should probably reserve my dose before macron send it somewhere in the world...
 Wontonimo: calk it up to my otherwise quirky Canadian ways
 Mr_BlueBird: i am just 11, no dose for me&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: *chalk*
 reCurse: How is that confusing?
 Mr_BlueBird:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: "This last"
 eulerscheZahl: is it this weekend? last? "this last"
 reCurse: Obviously previous
 Mr_BlueBird: btw, am i the only person here of age 11?
 reCurse: I don't see how would that make sense as the current
 AntiSquid: why would you want the vax if you're that young Mr_BlueBird&#160;? lol
 Mr_BlueBird:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: kids are at lowest risk, you're better off not risking side effects
 Mr_BlueBird: i am not worried
 eulerscheZahl: there are a few users of similar age. not sure if any of them online here on chat right now
 Mr_BlueBird: yeah!
 reCurse: If you look into clashes you'll probably find more people your age
 eulerscheZahl: :flame:
 sprkrd: that sounded a bit backhanded :O
 Mr_BlueBird: um, user 5ALID is 1 year older than me
 Wontonimo: i thought skipping the lower age group was more about the development of the immune system and it not being as effective
 Wontonimo: I approve your message reCurse lol
 AntiSquid: there's a minimum age requirement, at least at my vax center but should be everywhere, something like 16 or you see a doctor first and you better have a guardian with you if you're a minor
 Wontonimo: congrats struct on 2nd in C4
 struct: thanks but I think I was a bit lucky on this submit
 eulerscheZahl: yes you were
 AntiSquid: what are you using struct?
 eulerscheZahl: lucky that reCurse didn't try the game yet
 struct: mcts solver
 reCurse: Which game, c4?
 struct: well i already cant beat msmits
 reCurse: Meh
 AntiSquid: oh alright
 eulerscheZahl: 274 players already, wow
 struct: euler you can make it top 10 with C# easily
 eulerscheZahl: it will soon bypass dots and boxes as the most popular community game
 kovi: lets push dice dual for pow...
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i just don't want to, struct
 eulerscheZahl: dual? Did i make a typo in the title?
 sprkrd: you all really are upping its popularity, a lot of chat about c4 recently
 AntiSquid: is anyone using bitboads for diel duels&#160;?

 sprkrd: what i find most ridiculous about golfing is the creation of programming languages specifically targetting golfing
 sprkrd: I'd mention one of those programming languages, but their name is as ridiculous as their intent
 struct: lol
 reCurse: Perl?
 sprkrd: ha!
 sprkrd: Yeah, Perls is kind of write it once, never read it again
 sprkrd: I always try to take the chance to bash Perl, but you beat me to it this time
 derjack: next time perl the bash
 sprkrd: the puns
 sprkrd: they never stop
 sprkrd: :joy:
 bouchert: That reminds me.  I once took a closer look at the "Advent of Code" leaderboards...
 bouchert: Particularly, the person who seems to regularly be at the top, "betaveros"
 bouchert: Clicking through to his Github page, I see he invented his own private code golf language, which he tweaks whenever he finds a solution that can't be expressed succinctly enough.
 eulerscheZahl: my personal nightmare project on github: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext">https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>
 IvesL: is the site lagging or just my problem, it seems running quite slow
 bouchert: I expect he's also so good at challenges partly because thinking in this language is now second nature to him, so it's literally just down to typing time, so code golf actually does get him the answers faster.
 ANONYMOUS42: "if you squint, can look like extensions to the language itself." lmao
 bouchert: Oh dear.  For people who feel C# isn't enough like Haskell
 eulerscheZahl: someone at work decided to make heavy use of it
 IvesL: and has clash of code been updated? i have a feel the score rises faster
 Marchete: Functional? but why?
 Wontonimo: because OO is dead, didn't you get the tiktok?
 BlaiseEbuth: If you want to code in functional, use a real functional language... -_-
 Marchete: this
 reCurse: Yes because switching to a whole other language for wanting a few features makes sense
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Yes. You're right. I forgot the universal law that force you to use a single language for a whole project...
 reCurse: Not much difference if you give up the whole leverage from the code you already have
 BlaiseEbuth: leverage?
 reCurse: You know, you might have the entire structures laid out with the right data, objects, etc already done. Then there's a part of the problem where functional would be a good fit.
 eulerscheZahl: emprise
 bouchert: C# has been pretty liberal about implementing the bits of functional programming it can, while not necessarily forcing you down a functional pathway if it's not the easiest way to work.
 reCurse: Exactly.
 bouchert: Sure, it may not be as elegant or airtight as a pure functional language, but I like the flexibility.
 reCurse: That's the reason it sees adoption.
 eulerscheZahl: and well integrated into the rest. like working with lambdas on a list and then getting a list again with ToList()
 eulerscheZahl: while that LanguageExt lib has its own collections and I still have no idea how to easily convert them back into something closer to the common libraries
 BlaiseEbuth: Sure. But interfacing languages is also possible. Probably don't worth the effort for little pieces of code though...
 reCurse: Take that from someone who spent years of professional work with language interop
 reCurse: Don't.
 BlaiseEbuth: Why?
 reCurse: Neverending nightmare
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Can you develop a little? Cause I heard the exact opposite from somebody else. So I'm curious ^^
 reCurse: I'm trying to find an answer that won't start a 2 hours discussion but it's difficult
 Curious: Every time someone is curious, I receive a message&#160;:))))
 reCurse: The amount of friction it causes in a lot of ways is just not worth it. Maintenance, debugging, hiring, etc....
 reCurse: To the point the shitty solution in the language you have is often ending up quicker and better than the perfect solution in the other language
 Marchete: after reading you I agree
 Marchete: the shitty solution is cost effective
 Marchete: just reuse your staff
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... I see. I can easily imagine. But the person who told me about that was so enthusiast...&#160;:)
 reCurse: Well obviously I'm exaggerating for effect, not going to pretend there's never a case where it can work.
 reCurse: But I'd wager I'm more often right than wrong on that one
 eulerscheZahl: "just reuse your staff"as opposed to laying everyone off and starting a new round of hirings?
 BlaiseEbuth: :p
 reCurse: So for one I'm glad new paradigms are added even if they feel bolted on because of legacy design constraints.
 reCurse: C# taught me functional can actually be useful in the real world
 reCurse: And back when I did a lot of C# I'd use those features quite often
 reCurse: Trying to find back an insightful article on the same subject going along the same lines. Gamedev company that started new tools in web and ended up back to qt because of that kind of friction.
 reCurse: Mirrored my own experience strangely enough
 BlaiseEbuth: I confess I only use functional for fun on CG and stuff... In what cases writing pieces of functional code in a non-functional project is pertinent&#160;?
 reCurse: Found it, not article but slides <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://deplinenoise.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/webtoolspostmortem.pdf">https://deplinenoise.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/webtoolspostmortem.pdf</a>
 reCurse: LINQ is a good example
 1rre: I use functional near-exclusively unless I'm using C - there's not a lot that you can do in one domain that you can't do in the other, it just depends which you're useful
 eulerscheZahl: 10 slides to read 2 sentences...
 Florian_bg_love: big cock in my mouth

 Mr_BlueBird: online gdb dosen't needs login
 MSmits: you need login i guess yeah
 MSmits: well not to see other people's stuff if it's public
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure i used repl.it without login in the past
 MSmits: (which it usually is)
 Mr_BlueBird: well, you need to login for saving
 MSmits: well it creates a temporary repo if you dont login
 eulerscheZahl: and for hosting I use heroku
 MSmits: not sure if you can still do that
 eulerscheZahl: once a month I get this:You have used 80% of your 550 free dyno hours for May 2021. The following steps can help you keep your app running smoothly.

 MSmits: from people visiting?
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: we'll just puzzle first half of the month
 eulerscheZahl: by default your freely hosted website is offline. when someone wants to visit it, the server starts it and keeps it running until there are 30min without a request
 MSmits: Oh I see
 eulerscheZahl: you can keep it running for maybe 23 days straight each month. then it gets suspended and you have to pay

 TheBatMan_TM: yeah, i tried { crossDomain: true } in the axios call but still doesn't work
 TheBatMan_TM: use08 and us09?
 eulerscheZahl: us, not use
 TheBatMan_TM: ok what is that?
 eulerscheZahl: different hosting regions. can't you just put it on the same domain?
 TheBatMan_TM: gitpod.io creates the domains
 TheBatMan_TM: when i run the servers, it opens it in those links

 darkhorse64: wow&#160;!
 struct: lol
 jacek: good testcase for wincheck code
 MSmits: 1 or 7 is fairly balanced, but currently it seems p2 has some uncounterable branches, so it may  end up being a win for p2
 MSmits: but I thought this before. Could be some narrow branches that make it a draw anyways, or a win for p1 who knows. But for know looks better for p2
 MSmits: for now
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/y2MTrj3">https://imgur.com/a/y2MTrj3</a>
 MSmits: this is what best play gives in my meta mcts. See how p1's best reply only has 40% WR
 MSmits: doesnt get better with depth, p2 beats all branches here for now
 struct: yeah
 struct: this is what i meant by saying it was hard to get close to 53%
 MSmits: 15 million of my 45 million games are in a branch that's never visited anymore
 MSmits: this branch had a lot of value for p1
 MSmits: so my 53% average is a bad estimate
 MSmits: p2 took a different path that is much better
 MSmits: when it found this, my bot started doing a lot better
 MSmits: it's p2 reply move 3
 MSmits: was doing 4 before
 MSmits: anyways, you can just run games vs me as p2 and you'll see it do this move

 YurkovAS: is it possible to _mm512_reduce_and_epi64 but for m256i?
 struct: no
 struct: I do this
 struct: result_mask = _mm256_or_si256(result_mask, _mm256_permute4x64_epi64(result_mask, _MM_SHUFFLE(0, 1, 2, 3)));result_mask = _mm256_or_si256(result_mask, _mm256_permute4x64_epi64(result_mask, _MM_SHUFFLE(2, 3, 0, 1)));
 struct: for or
 YurkovAS: thanks!
 struct: what are you trying to do YurkovAS?
 YurkovAS: avx for c4
 struct: and all elements in __m256i?
 struct: but which operation are you trying to do
 YurkovAS: i'm need "and" for 4 int64
 YurkovAS: (board &amp; (board &lt;&lt; 9) &amp; (board &lt;&lt; 18) &amp; (board &lt;&lt; 27)
 struct: but and 4 ints with another 4 ints?
 struct: _mm256_and_si256(board, _mm256_sllv_epi64(board, first_Shift));
 YurkovAS: _mm256_sllv_epi64 - shift leftand you need "and" this value (4 x int64)
 struct: yeah
 struct: you and the current value with the shifted value
 YurkovAS: struct thanks!now i'm understand 
 struct: np
 struct: to test if any bit is set
 struct: out of all 4 ints
 struct: after all shifts are done
 struct: you can also do this
 struct: return !_mm256_testz_si256(temp, temp);
 YurkovAS: :thumbsup:
 ItIsSoLo: hey everyone
 Wontonimo: hello and سلام
 ItIsSoLo: و سلام مجدد
 Wontonimo: sorry, i don't speak Farsi but my wife does.
 Wontonimo: and, we have to keep it English here

 ItIsSoLo: Oh I just joined the community I didn't know
 Wontonimo: yeah, my bad for starting it :D
 Wontonimo: hey, Welcome&#160;!
 Wontonimo: what brought you here?
 ItIsSoLo: Thanks!
 ItIsSoLo: I like games a lot and codes even more
 ItIsSoLo: Combination of them? IT'S AWESOME
 Wontonimo: there is lots here, there is clash of code (which you've probably already seen), and puzzles (called practice), and compete (bot battles, my favorite!)
 ItIsSoLo: I've been coding for less than a month, I think I have a long road in front of me.
 ZarthaxX: and frustration
 ZarthaxX: lots of that
 struct: no frustrations
 struct: unless you play connect 4
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ItIsSoLo: xD
 Wontonimo: do you know about for loops and while loops&#160;?
 ItIsSoLo: yeah I've learned basics
 Wontonimo: okay, how about data structures like lists, and hash maps (also called associative arrays)
 ItIsSoLo: not completely
 ItIsSoLo: I only know what they are, just the surface.
 Wontonimo: This site may be advanced for your abilities.  Feel free to stick around.
 Wontonimo: do anyone have any suggestions of other sites?  struct ZarthaxX&#160;?
 ItIsSoLo: I'm not going to let my lack of ability let me down. :grin:
 struct: not really, i mainly use this one
 struct: Its been a long time since i had to use a begginer website
 Wontonimo: i just thought one of you would remember from previous conversations, not that you've used one
 Wontonimo: maybe codecademy.com , maybe khanacademy.org 
 Wontonimo: but don't pay anyone!  There are 100's of free sites with good resources
 ItIsSoLo: what abilities do I need for competing here?
 DehyDev: i a mroblox developer
 Wontonimo: sorry for the long delay.  you need to be patient with yourself
 Wontonimo: and keep at it a little every day for a very long time
 joooy: b
 I8achopstick: h
 Wontonimo: i
 KamadoTanjiro: hi
 Westicles: Ha, 15 of my temperature golfs went from 100% to 0%
 DaNinja: how come? system calls changed?

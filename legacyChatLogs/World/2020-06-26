 Zerp: what heuristics do you guys use in gitc? this is all the info i have access to so far <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/474665606">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/474665606</a>
 Zerp: under gameinfo
 WINWINWIN: read the feedback and strategies thread, always a goldmine of valuable info
 Zerp: where is it?
 Zerp: wait i think i found it
 Zerp: were you referring to this page?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ghost-in-the-cell-puzzle-discussion/2644/33">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ghost-in-the-cell-puzzle-discussion/2644/33</a>

 Zerp: just found it through google xd
 Zerp: oh wow, didnt know you had to add a extra turn for every factory in the shortest path
 Zerp: makes a huge difference
 Zerp: makes finding shortest path a bit more complicated though
 Zerp: not sure if it's enough to add a +1 in here
 Zerp: dist[i, j] &gt; dist[i, k] + dist[k, j] + 1
 caubeloatchoat24: Hello how to choose game mode in public game bro. Help me&#160;:(( . Hate Shortest&#160;:((
 Uljahn: game mode is random
 Uljahn: but you can choose the game mode in private clashes
 Zerp: just spend so much time fixing bugs and adding new features yet my new bot cant defeat my old bot that used broken code and random variables xd
 caubeloatchoat24: :sweat_smile: Okay mate @Uljahn
 Zerp: shouldnt i be able to  do List.Add(object) for a list of objects?
 Zerp: wait nvm it was scope issue
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: that's a feature
 Automaton2000: didn't know you could have a look at that
 Zerp: automaton2000:  shouldnt i be able to  do List.Add(object) for a list of objects?
 Automaton2000: i am just a beginner
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: hey Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits, how's it going
 MSmits: I am still fitting oware params. Looks like I found a version thats anti-Agade :P
 Zerp: didnt automaton use to ping random ppl 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4178732d-5891-4eeb-bfcf-9948aeefd9d2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4178732d-5891-4eeb-bfcf-9948aeefd9d2</a>
 MSmits: for some reason increasing my 1-seed param from 300 to 400 does this :confused:
 Astrobytes: Nice! And it's not dreadful against the others either
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Those damn parameters
 MSmits: yeah, i only increased it from 300  to 400, so other values might be better
 MSmits: and still have many other params to try
 MSmits: so i guess Agade's bot might not actually be better than recurs e or Robo.. it's just how the params are fitted
 MSmits: all 3 are good bots
 Astrobytes: That they are. I've been concentrating on Othello recently, haven't tried to see which params work against Agad e
 MSmits: the only reason i do this is because i have the end game database now. My bot is different, so it needs refitting
 MSmits: i wouldnt refit the whole thing just to beat Agade
 Astrobytes: I always tweak to see what affects whom in what way, don't necessarily change my bot though
 Astrobytes: Gives you a feel for what they're prioritising
 MSmits: that takes so much time though, i try not to fit against any specific player, thats why i pick all 4
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's something I do when I'm killing time or bored :P
 uvBoss: yelo
 Astrobytes: grene
 uvBoss: nyone got ideas on how i could use neural network for bot programming&#160;?
 uvBoss: xD
 uvBoss: anyone*
 uvBoss: not using algorithms but neural network
 uvBoss: or gentic algorithms would laso be fine
 uvBoss: help
 Uljahn: yes
 uvBoss: lmao tell me then
 uvBoss: how do i train??
 uvBoss: coz u only play once
 Snef: yes
 uvBoss: do i adjust the weights manually or something?
 Astrobytes: Download replays. Train offline.
 uvBoss: and how do i download replays??
 Uljahn: GA could be used online with a simualtion
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 uvBoss: okay
 Astrobytes: And yeah, you can use GA online as Uljahn says
 uvBoss: omg @Astrobytes
 uvBoss: dat link
 uvBoss: t so much
 uvBoss: ty
 tomatoes: and submissions has 100kb limit
 MSmits: 100k character limit
 MSmits: = 200kb
 MSmits: 16 bit per character
 MSmits: hi tomatoes 
 uvBoss: oke ty guys
 uvBoss: im trying that now
 tomatoes: hello
 MSmits: grats on your uttt bot, I submitted yesterday, got goot results vs your awesome bot, but I draw too much vs others
 MSmits: goot = good
 wlesavo: got bot
 tomatoes: have some troubles with O too. thought about trying to make draw from beginning
 MSmits: karlis o beats p2 Hard
 MSmits: if i try a CG bench against everyone with me as p2, I have about 50% against everyone except karlis o, which will be  &lt; 10%
 wlesavo: MSmits if you dont mind sharing, i remember you saying random rollouts is bad, can you give a hint of what can be used instead?
 MSmits: random rollouts is not bad
 MSmits: it just depends on the game
 wlesavo: i mean for uttt
 MSmits: in uttt they perform quite well
 MSmits: ah
 wlesavo: oh ok
 wlesavo: maybe it was out of context
 MSmits: well I prefer blocking and winning moves in the rollout, but it was only a small impriovement and maybe it no longer is, if i test it now
 MSmits: I also tested avoiding moves that give the opponent a free move, but that was bad
 MSmits: mostly because near the end of the game there is no avoiding it and you'll just play badly
 MSmits: though maybe i should try it again, just up to a certain turn nr.
 wlesavo: oh thx, that bothered me for a while :slight_smile: i probably heard you taking about another game and just assumed it was uttt
 MSmits: probably, I talk a lot
 tomatoes: i use only ucb, if no visits yet then parent values as placeholder
 MSmits: parent values?
 tomatoes: wins/visits
 MSmits: mmh but wont that give every child the same value?
 MSmits: btw, we were talking about the random part, not the selection
 Snef: when you select on child they all hame same parent so same score..?
 Snef: one*
 Snef: have*
 tomatoes: random selection removed
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i just select the first unvisited child
 MSmits: i break out of the loop
 Snef: ^
 MSmits: there is a bias from this ofc
 MSmits: but i never found it to matter
 wlesavo: from what i know random rollouts should be quite bad in general, because it is basically off policy method whithout accounting for sample ratio, but yeah, not much fast alternatives 
 MSmits: the problem with uttt is that it doesnt have very good heuristics
 MSmits: there are a few, but they arent perfect either and putting them in also slows your sim
 MSmits: like the teccles-heuristic. It works great, until late game (20+ plies)
 MSmits: if a board is still empty then, you might allow an opponent to send you to a bad board
 MSmits: because he has 8 choices to pick from
 MSmits: and one of them is going to be bad for you
 tomatoes: im using heuristics only as small tips to mcts
 MSmits: you mean you have weighted probability?
 wlesavo: i think you can use soft heuristics on selection, but not on rollouts
 tomatoes: kinda hey, check this, should be fine
 wlesavo: for uttt that is
 MSmits: tomatoes you mean you have priors in UCB, bonuses for good moves so they get explored sooner?
 tomatoes: yes
 MSmits: yeah i tried that, some of those do work
 MSmits: it's a lot of trial and error
 MSmits: wlesavo you can indeed use heuristics on rollouts
 MSmits: I do this
 MSmits: for a small improvement
 MSmits: I have it so that if blocking and/or winning moves are always preferred if they exist
 MSmits: blocking and winning being equal in this regard
 MSmits: Robo came up with that. It is at most a few&#160;% winrate boost, but it worked
 MSmits: of course this hinges on you being able to know fast which moves qualify. If you spend too much time calculating, performance drops hard
 wlesavo: MSmits well i meant not too complicated, i use smth like that as well, as somebody suggested to increase a probability of such moves
 MSmits: nah, probability based random rollouts wont work i tink
 MSmits: tried it, was too slow
 MSmits: weighted random is hard to pull off
 MSmits: anyway, gotta go. Sad to go when we're talking about uttt&#160;:(
 wlesavo: MSmits i prepopulated pull of possible positions, so there would be twice as much winning moves
 tomatoes: i tried probabilities rollouts in othello. better than pure random, but still bad
 MSmits: prepopulated?
 wlesavo: this way it does not hurt at all
 MSmits: why twice as much?
 MSmits: do you mean you precalculated an array where you look up if either player has a winning move?
 MSmits: and it's twice as much because 2 players?
 wlesavo: MSmits for a current miniboard i have possible moves, so the ones that can close it just appear twice in this array
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: funny way to do it
 MSmits: but sure, could work 
 wlesavo: twice because this way you have smth like discrete probability
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: allright ttyl guys!
 Astrobytes: laters
 Astrobytes: I'm out for a bit too
 wlesavo: gl
 MSmits: yay train wifi works. Who's up for more uttt talk :grin:
 wlesavo: lol
 MSmits: i'm off to visit colleagues house to say goodbye to schoolyear, its almost done now
 wlesavo: will next year start remoutedly for you or is it not known yet?
 MSmits: should be starting normally. The agreement is that the students dont have to social distance except they have to stay away from the teachers
 MSmits: but 2nd wave will change things obviously
 MSmits: might be as soon as october
 MSmits: i'll still be using some remote learning stuff I have been using though, some of it was an eyeopener
 MSmits: like letting students photograph their homework and handing it in so i can quickly see if they're doing the work
 wlesavo: yeah, we basically done with self isolation, everything open already, except for boarders, not very long for second wave as well
 MSmits: really? seems fast. Russia got a late start on the epidemic
 MSmits: The US opened too soon and now they are screwed
 MSmits: but maybe it took less time in Russia if the outbreaks were smaller
 MSmits: it helps when you can look at other countries and learn from their mistakes
 wlesavo: yeah, people tired, and with our mentaility nobody cares anymore, and there is a constitution changing for putin to rule another 2 terms, so the goveerment is interested in pulling that earlier
 MSmits: why does he even bother, cant he just let an underling take over for a bit like he did before :P
 MSmits: I think most Russians know he is their dictator dont they?
 MSmits: they're not stupid
 wlesavo: maybe it is not enough for him anymore :slight_smile: 
 eulerscheZahl: the savior
 MSmits: is it safe as a Russian to be critical of the government on media like these? I know in China you cant do that
 wlesavo: well some are ok with that, and there is an effective propaganda as well, many people truly believe that he is a savior
 MSmits: that doesnt surprise me at all
 MSmits: if people are able to follow trump with all of the obvious :poop:  he pulls, Putin would indeed be a savior
 wlesavo: nah, it is ok while you not posting it on social media, and even if you do nobody cares until you make some troubles. but it can be indeed used against you
 MSmits: ok so as long as you're relatively anonymous, it;s fine
 MSmits: don't leave your tea unsupervised, just in case
 tomatoes: no need to do something to be guilty in russia
 eulerscheZahl: we will just interpret some criticism into your lines if you don't praise him
 MSmits: hey euler
 MSmits: did you also do Othello?
 MSmits: maybe just your basic minimax you always do on these board games?
 eulerscheZahl: let's go private
 NgonTran: HELLO 
 MSmits: oh, sure, i dont have that much time though
 Hjax: good morning 
 eulerscheZahl: good afternoon to you as well
 Hjax: i got my othello working last night :D 
 MSmits: cool Hjax
 MSmits: minimax also?
 Hjax: mcts
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: is it good?
 Hjax: its ok, i wrote it in java, so its not quite as speedy as it could be 
 Hjax: i plan to port it to something faster
 MSmits: ahh right
 MSmits: they say mcts is inferior on othello
 MSmits: havent tried yet so i dunno
 Hjax: yeah but i hadnt written mcts before 
 Hjax: i wanted to try it 
 Hjax: ive done minimax lots of times 
 MSmits: weird to start on a game where its known to be bad :P
 MSmits: coulda done a uttt, easy sim and you get legend + cp
 Hjax: i could still do that
 Hjax: i already have the search 
 MSmits: yeah 
 Hjax: just need a board representation 
 MSmits: 10 ints is basic
 Hjax: and i wrote one in C++ a while ago, so i can probably port it 
 MSmits: 9 per board + 1 for bigboard
 MSmits: dont save state on node
 MSmits: save moves
 MSmits: thats about it
 MSmits: there are other ways, but this what everyone starts with
 Hjax: why is saving moves better? 
 MSmits: train arriving, gtg hf 
 Hjax: kk cya 
 MSmits: sorry 1 more stop lol
 MSmits: saving moves hm
 MSmits: because your gamestate will be too big to put on every node
 Scarfield: you need a large object pool, and the nodes will take up less space if only storing the move.
 MSmits: othello is 2x uint64_t
 MSmits: uttt = 10x uint32_t, so 2,5x the siz
 Hjax: i tried to do the node pool thing people have mentioned 
 MSmits: moves are cheaply applied
 Hjax: and it didnt make my java mcts any faster 
 MSmits: nah its better for c++
 MSmits: node creation becomes a bottleneck when your speed allows you to make millions
 Hjax: right now i think im spending most of my time calculating UCT
 MSmits: its expensive, try fast inverse squareroot
 Scarfield: not doing rollouts?
 MSmits: there are some approx roots also some simd functions i think
 MSmits: but c++ first
 Scarfield: i mean, rollouts is not your bottleneck?
 Hjax: my board representation is really fast 
 Hjax: when i benchmarked it last night, i think rollouts and uct were roughly tied 
 MSmits: same for me i think
 MSmits: a bit more on the rollouts
 MSmits: but uct still a minor bottleneck
 MSmits: allright thats it gtg for real now.
 Hjax: bye MSmits
 Scarfield: :wave:
 MSmits: bye
 Hjax: this boss is something else 
 Scarfield: are you using fast log, fast sqrt?
 Hjax: no i used the normal java methods for sqrt and ln, i was tired and just wanted it to work 
 Hjax: i definitely can optimize it 
 Scarfield: for UCT the log is root 10, not ln though
 Scarfield: oh wait im wrong
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/97401218-8625-421e-ac20-a06631a6ec44">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/97401218-8625-421e-ac20-a06631a6ec44</a>
 Scarfield: these functions are for C++ but they can be rewritten for java i suppose
 Hjax: i wonder how much faster they are than the native java methods 
 Hjax: ill do some benchmarking later 
 Hjax: how does your bot work? it beat me a lot last night 
 Scarfield: for UTTT? 
 Hjax: othello
 Scarfield: vanilla MCTS for both
 Hjax: ah so same as me 
 Scarfield: bit boards, but am not getting many full rollouts, so will try and optimize, or change to minMax at some point
 Snef: how much rollout Scarfield&#160;?
 Scarfield: 1k ish +/- the first turns (exluding the very first turn)
 Snef: oh ok
 Scarfield: i expect this should be Much higher
 Snef: random rollout&#160;?
 Snef: it should be faster then :p
 wlesavo: fix it :slight_smile:
 Scarfield: yea, the way i determine legal moves is my bottleneck by far, but still havent had any good ideas for improving. Am close to start searching the net for answers, but like the process of figuring it out&#160;:)
 Snef: aaah i see
 Snef: are you doing them one by one&#160;?
 Scarfield: yea
 Scarfield: would like to do it faster, but havent figured out da way
 Snef: i'm not gonna spoil it then :p
 Scarfield: xD
 Hjax: ah yeah, mine determines all of the legal moves at once 
 Hjax: its quite fast 
 Hjax: Snef i beat you a few times last night :P
 Hjax: youre still better though 
 Snef: Hjax we have same code just with different rollcounts
 Snef: ofc you'll beat me :p
 Snef: that's same with me and the boss
 Scarfield: had a feeling you should be able to do that, might start asking for tips soon :p
 Hjax: my rollouts arent super fast yet
 darkhorse64: Scarfield: google "bitboard methods for games". It has been shared multiple times on this chat so it's not really a spoiler
 Snef: darkhorse64 i think he said he like to search by himself first
 Hjax: darkhorse64 your boss beat me up and took my lunch money 
 Scarfield: sure ty
 Hjax: i went like 0-12 vs it 
 tomatoes: yea, very nice pdf 
 Hjax: ive never read this pdf, but i think i know how to bitboard
 darkhorse64: Sometimes, you get by with a little help from your friends
 Snef: well it's not that hard, you just need to get into it :p
 Hjax: right now i get about 7000 rollouts on the second move, but my search was kind of thrown together last night when i was tried 
 Hjax: i think i can optimize it a lot 
 Hjax: tired* 
 darkhorse64: Honestly, this is a nice introduction (a bit outdated though) and it's not like your bot writes itself after that
 Scarfield: you should beat my bot then, about 7x fster
 Hjax: i had a bug for a while last night where i forgot to reverse the scores i was propagating up the tree 
 Hjax: somehow it was still playing decently
 darkhorse64: I got interested in bitboarding when doing bandas
 Hjax: which i found very confusing 
 darkhorse64: mcts debugging is difficult
 Scarfield: yea bandas was what got me started as well, but othello is not as straight foreward i think
 tanmaycodernovice: @ludowsky hey bro 
 darkhorse64: finding what pawns you can push vs what pawns are surrounded is not that different
 Hjax: i still have a bunch of improvements i can make, mcts solver, tree reuse, optimization 
 Hjax: not sure if all of those things combined will put me above the boss
 Snef: i think it'll
 Scarfield: yea i remember you mentioned that, never improved my bot from a loop there either xD
 Hjax: what are you doing right now Snef? do you have tree reuse?
 Snef: Hjax no
 Snef: i haven othin but basic mcts
 Snef: nothing*
 Hjax: i see
 Snef: i want to get to 40k roll out before
 Scarfield: thats a nice improvement though, and you can get the opp moves as input, so much easier for othello 
 Snef: but i don't feel motivated rn
 Hjax: i also need to clean up my code a lot 
 Hjax: theres a lot "i want it to work before i sleep" code in there
 Hjax: because i really wanted to get something submitted last night
 Scarfield: thats basicly my whole UTTT code xD
 Shagufta_Siddique: is there anybody else who can help me
 Shagufta_Siddique: i need to solve the puzzle how time flies by c++ , its my project but dn't know how to solve it  ,please if someone can help me
 Uljahn: jeez, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how can i share my code
 TyLuu: the same name with my boss
 TyLuu: sorry. mistake group
 Scarfield: lol have checked the pdf, the legal moves for othello seems so obvious after reading it
 darkhorse64: The boss awaits
 Hjax: the boss is a a monster 
 Hjax: 100% winrate against me right now 
 Astrobytes: Hi Hjax, got it working I see&#160;:)
 Hjax: i did! 
 Hjax: its not super optimized yet, only getting about 6k rollouts on turn 2 
 Hjax: mostly because my UCT isnt fast
 Astrobytes: Well that's the toughest part out of the way at least!Precalculating?
 Hjax: precalculating what? 
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: sqrtLog and invSqrt
 Hjax: ah im just using the native java methods for now 
 Astrobytes: Precalc will help a lot
 Hjax: i just wanted it to work so i could sleep last night 
 Astrobytes: lol, cleanup time
 Hjax: yep
 jacek: to be frank from my quick tests, othello is one of those games that dont really benefit from mcts solver 
 Hjax: ive seen a few games where my bot just gets eliminated while reporting a 25% win chance 
 Hjax: solver would at least prevent those dumb losses 
 Hjax: tree reuse will be a much bigger gain for me 
 darkhorse64: Against the biggies, the game is decided between move 30-35.
 darkhorse64: Usually in 4 plies, my eval drops from 50% to 5%
 Hjax: how would i recompute the sqrt part? isnt there too many possibilities? 
 Hjax: precomputing the log part is straight forward 
 darkhorse64: There is no consensus. I don't do that
 darkhorse64: because it means huge table, overflows check
 tomatoes: rsqrt should be a bit faster
 darkhorse64: Yes
 struct: Hi
 AntiSquid: hi
 Astrobytes: Hi
 jacek: :B
 Astrobytes: That's a new one

 Exa65536: (from the "last battles" page, I mean)
 Edrevan: not in the last battles page
 Exa65536: is there some other way to get cerr output for the last ply of a game which was played in the league? (as in, not in the IDE)
 Edrevan: but if your code truly is deterministic but you dont get the same result, it can be only 2 things&#160;: either the opponent's code isn't deterministic, or you barely stay within the time limit
 Edrevan: do you measure how long your code takes each turn&#160;?
 Exa65536: Yeah, and I pipe that to cerr
 Edrevan: are you close to the 50ms mark&#160;?
 EvModder: hmm i've noticed something
 EvModder: whenever there is a bug in my enemy tracking so that it fails entirely and doesn't track enemies, my ranking for that submit is way higher
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, this is going to be tough
 cegprakash: MattSOrme what happened
 Icebox: moin :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl how far do u  plan to cause accidents
 eulerscheZahl: half of my bot is a big accident
 cegprakash: do u plan it like 20 turns ahead? 
 Exa65536: This is for Ultimate Tic-tac-toe, which has a 100 ms/move limit. And I'm generally well under it, but I currently can't abort mid-iteration and iteration costs are erratic - so I'm just aborting after the first iteration that lasts at least 17 ms. If I could see the cerr output of the last ply of a game where I timed out, I could see how long the last successful iteration lasted and adjust the threshold so it'd have aborted after that
 cegprakash: that would be crazy
 eulerscheZahl: hell no
 eulerscheZahl: impossible to plan that. opponent can switch or move everywhere in that time
 Icebox: ceg didn't you say you're using depth 20?
 cegprakash: I still do
 cegprakash: when I have 20 pellets
 Icebox: :thinking:
 cegprakash: but I assume enemy doesn't move unless he wants to kill me
 cegprakash: I don't have an enemy dummy
 cegprakash: which I'll add later tonight
 eulerscheZahl: the squirrel just came again to ask for a peanut&#160;:)
 Icebox: god damn disney princesses
 cegprakash: * 2 pacs*
 thethiny: When my friends ask me how I went from Bronze to Silver I tell them I changed my IDE and submitted
 thethiny: TechnicallyTheTruth
 cegprakash: plz don't write that in ur post mortem thethiny
 cegprakash: :D
 thethiny: :D
 thethiny: sometimes you guys are boring :D
 eulerscheZahl: when my friends ask me how I ...wait, I have no friends playing CG&#160;:(
 cegprakash: I can be ur friend
 Durkin: hell man, forget a friend playing, I'd be happy if a single person from my college did this
 thethiny: @eulerscheZahl do we have to be in Legend tier to be your friends?
 thethiny: @Durkin well I sent the link to 5 of my friends and 2 only played, the 3rd only signed up.
 eulerscheZahl: i mean those who know me in person don't play CG
 thethiny: that's sad
 cegprakash: under lockdown nobody is going to know u  in person
 cegprakash: we can video chat eulerscheZahl aftr the contest
 Durkin: yeah I'll have to send out some links next contest, this was a blast, think I could rope in a few
 cegprakash: show me ur code and lets have fun eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: and lets make some gifs
 EvModder: eulerscheZahl im playing vs your bot, it seems whichever of us doesn't time out wins
 EvModder: lots for me to learn from this game though lol:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466027661">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466027661</a>
 thethiny: finally beaten clyde
 thethiny: üò≠
 EvModder: grats!
 EvModder: BTW that replay I linked is my IDE code, and it's not as good as it looks
 EvModder: I think I lose that game with submitted code, and the IDE code has some big issues they just don't come up in that one
 MattSOrme: ffs. Something is wiping my stored neighbours
 thethiny: probably your other neighbors
 thethiny: stealing your nodes
 thethiny: Rank 988/988
 thethiny: very nice indeed
 EvModder: i often find myself 78/78 because of bad submits
 thethiny: same here now
 thethiny: everyone in silver is killing my pacs
 thethiny: anyone got a seed for 2 pacs?
 EvModder: they will do that&#160;:)
 EvModder: not offhand sorry
 thethiny: np
 wi_lius: how to set a seed in online IDE?
 EvModder: i have to rewrite so much :l
 EvModder: i was basing my code on the assumption my pacs always move in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
 EvModder: but now i want to change their move order and it complicates things
 EvModder: actually nvm i can just add "move_order" member to my Pac class
 EvModder: and sort on that
 thethiny: changing the order is interesting indeed
 thethiny: I always move them in the order 0 -&gt; 4 then I go back and readjust if clashes happen
 thethiny: works fine for me
 thethiny: anticipating everything is costly
 EvModder: i want to prioritize pacs that are "escaping" vs regular movements
 DaNinja: why does move order matter?
 MattSOrme: i haven't done anything about move ordering. I just always deal with them in order&#160;:/ 
 EvModder: by move order i mean the order in which i pic moves for pacs. I keep track of which moves i've already picked so I don't repick them, DaNinja.so move order lets me prioritize pacs in danger so other of my pacs don't block their moves
 EvModder: but i should've give away too many trade secrets&#160;;)
 thethiny: orrr
 thethiny: you can move them in order
 thethiny: then after you're done
 thethiny: you check if they were panic and CLASHING
 DaNinja: I see, so its for selecting the best move for each pac
 thethiny: then you add +1 move to the other pacs
 thethiny: in my case I have a path for every pac
 EvModder: perhaps i will need to reorganize moves at the end as well
 thethiny: if the path gonna block another, I just repeat one step in the path
 thethiny: this way if it was gonna speed, it wont
 thethiny: or if it was gonna mvoe 1, it'll wait
 thethiny: I can beat clyde but not the enemies
 thethiny: this is sad
 EvModder: eulerscheZahl what is this godliness:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466041814">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466041814</a>
 EvModder: that trap at the beginning
 EvModder: trying to program something that fancy into my bot would be a nightmare
 EvModder: i guess that's top 10 strats
 WINWINWIN: Wow, the trap is amazing!!
 Zandy156: but at the same time he gave up 2 super pellets for no reason
 EvModder: every bot has some bugs
 Zandy156: should have gotten the double kill at least
 fasil: die()
 fasil: System.exit(0)
 fasil: done
 fasil: fi
 eulerscheZahl: not the nicest thing to kill you right there :P
 EvModder: i am not even going to bother figuring out a way to avoid that situation
 EvModder: too next-level for me xD
 eulerscheZahl: i don't avoid either
 eulerscheZahl: as long as only few people go for the kill, you will just waste turns
 eulerscheZahl: and somehow i still lose with 5 vs 4
 EvModder: luck
 kkhabour: hi
 eulerscheZahl: you get all 4 big pellets
 EvModder: my bot has such a bad pellet collection strategy that your bot couldn't predict is eulerscheZahl
 EvModder: oh, yeah that happened too
 eulerscheZahl: my opening is really bad. not just in this game
 EvModder: my opening is pretty good for the most part, but i fall apart late game
 EvModder: my pacs start following eachother for the last few pellets instead of splitting up
 Csipcsirip: hm 40% of my cpu usage was the pow function. lessons learned
 EvModder: oh wow
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 javatar2018: Hi EvModder, can i speak to you in private please urgent
 EvModder: i use pow() multiple times for every pellet on the grid, every turn
 EvModder: maybe i should rethink that
 EvModder: sure
 Csipcsirip: precache it in the first turn 
 EvModder: it hasn't caused me problems yet
 EvModder: but i'll keep that idea in mind if i need some extra performance
 Doju: Ahhh sht
 EvModder: hm?
 Doju: i've made a number of questionable design decisions 
 BenWo: lol morning Doju
 EvModder: im in that boat as well lol
 Doju: and now i need to change everything related to them
 Doju: morning BenWo
 Doju: agh
 Doju: i think i need to go from cell objects to numpy arrays
 Doju: but EVERYTHING is a cell in my thing
 EvModder: i also have Cell class
 EvModder: but im in c++ so it is okay for me&#160;:)
 Doju: or at least the precalc distance thing needs to be a numpy array
 Doju: instead of a dict
 BenWo: just because of performance?
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: my magic method will do a loooot of array math
 Doju: and python apparently doesnt like that
 BenWo: yeah I'm not very efficient either, though I'm not really having performance issues yet
 kovi: morning
 Doju: morning
 BenWo: morning kovi
 kovi: 1 day to go, first day i am not on top
 Zandy156: exciting
 kovi: psyho - legend alreadykarliso - hiding
 Doju: ah, maybe i should actually have my cells be np arrays instead of tuples&#160;:/
 Doju: wonder if that'll break stuff
 kovi: euler submit after a day or so
 eulerscheZahl: broken submit
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466053556">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466053556</a>
 Csipcsirip: cant break top70 anymore euler&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: not with this :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: somehow me local testrun said it's on par with the arena bot
 EvModder: i can't break top 20 anymore and idk what i did&#160;:(
 thethiny: ü§µüèªü§µüèª‚ö∞ü§µüèªü§µüèª
 thethiny: @EvModder nothing, others submitted too. I got pushed back by 300
 EvModder: yeah but this was in legend league like 5 hours ago
 thethiny: oh
 EvModder: and it's because of resubmit (i was 14th before)
 thethiny: go back to the history 
 thethiny: and submit your older one
 thethiny: and see
 EvModder: i'm going to keep fixing-forward
 EvModder: but i might do that, just to see
 thethiny: just to ease your mind
 EvModder: yeah
 dbdr: OK, I have an idea how to code a bot, let's do it!/me is gone coding
 <b>**thethiny test</b></p><p><img src="/a/44247984870201" /> <b>**thethiny is gone coding</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.gifer.com/2SIF.mp4">https://i.gifer.com/2SIF.mp4</a>
 EvModder: i have this line of code:v = v &lt;= 0&#160;? --v&#160;: -v;
 EvModder: except "v" is a more complicated name
 eulerscheZahl: refactor it
 EvModder: no it is beautiful
 EvModder: isv = v &gt; 0&#160;? -v&#160;: v-1;more readable?
 EvModder: i'll go with that
 thethiny: yeah the previous one would give error
 thethiny: you can't assign v to --v
 Doju: Also i need another grid but that one has to only have the cells
 EvModder: but can't you?
 Doju: ahrg
 Doju: wait no, i need a flat array
 Doju: okay that makes things a bit easier
 thethiny: submitting...
 thethiny: wish me luck
 EvModder: gl!
 Doju: gl
 thethiny: thanks üò≠
 BenWo: good luck&#160;:)
 thethiny: time out lol
 thethiny: time to fix the bugs
 thethiny: this guy is using random
 thethiny: I can't replicate the bug
 Doju: Time to change an integral part of my code and pray that everything doesn't break
 EvModder: rip
 BenWo: I tried that, now I have a cleaner version of what I had before that works worse
 thethiny: @Doju ü§µüèªü§µüèª‚ö∞ü§µüèªü§µüèª
 thethiny: @BenWo XD
 thethiny: I hate it when the replay doesn't produce the same match
 thethiny: My attacking works :D
 thethiny: List of Last Battles:
 thethiny: very nice
 BenWo: lol huh?
 thethiny: I lost all my battles once I ironed all the bugs
 thethiny: this is the system that I want to have but it's not performing well
 thethiny: Guess that's my capacity
 BenWo: ok that's what I thought you were saying, lol
 thethiny: I'm stuck at #227
 thethiny: sad life
 Doju: This is a miracle
 Doju: everything works
 javatar2018: how can i avoid blocked pacs&#160;?
 thethiny: üò≠üò≠üò≠
 Doju: Is there any more sensible way to work with flat arrays where the walls have been taken out than storing the index of the cell in that?
 thethiny: rephrase your question pls
 Doju: I've been storing dists from cell to every other cell in a dict
 Doju: with the other cell as the key and distance as value
 Doju: i want to make that a numpy array  that consists of only the walkable cells instead of a dict
 Doju: but since bfs doesn't return the distances in order it's a bit of a puzzle to put the values in the correct order
 thethiny: @AsaiYusuke congrats
 Doju: actually i guess i can just initially store them in a dict and move them into a list afterwards
 Doju: extra-actually:
 Doju: i'll just keep the original dict in place so i don't break anything
 thethiny: 100% battles at #72
 Doju: That was surprisingly easy
 ashikujjaman: which algorithm will be good in silver league?
 Doju: ashikujjaman for what goal?
 Doju: gathering pellets?
 Doju: that'll be for you to figure out :P
 ashikujjaman: :sweat:
 Doju: It's pretty much the point of the contest
 ashikujjaman: any hint's?
 thethiny: BFS with custom weights
 Doju: i'll give you the hint that even naive systems will go pretty far
 Doju: if you make them right
 EvModder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466080020">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466080020</a>
 EvModder: eulerscheZahl i eat 3 of yours and you still win
 thethiny: damn such a close fight
 eulerscheZahl: not very polite of you
 EvModder: sorry i am working on that
 EvModder: i'm actually about to rip out all my code for hunting enemy pacs because it's hurting me more than it's helping.
 eulerscheZahl: let me submit a version without killing. just to see how it ranks
 MarKes: Guys, how do you use timer, to kill process?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your langauge
 MarKes: C++
 eulerscheZahl: #include &lt;chrono&gt;
 MarKes: I use:  unsigned t0=clock(); but it works more random
 eulerscheZahl: auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
 eulerscheZahl: while (std::chrono::duration_cast&lt;std::chrono::nanoseconds&gt;(std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - start).count() &lt; time * (int)1e6) {
 eulerscheZahl: and make sure to start the timer AFTER reading the inputs
 MarKes: thanks, i will try
 Csipcsirip: or a nicer way:
 Csipcsirip: auto endt = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() + 48ms;while(endt &gt; chrono::high_resolution_clock::now()) 
 eulerscheZahl: peaceful seems to rank a little lower but not much. maybe i need a compromise
 struct: rand()&#160;% 2
 Csipcsirip: its realy hard to tell 1 elo is not that much
 dbf: like my boss in uni told me: just take to algorithms from articles, combine them so each is used when it is better and we will publish new article&#160;:)
 thethiny: you work as a research assitnant?
 dbf: no, it was when I was studying
 kovi: for the top the trueskill variance can be 3
 thethiny: okay I see
 kovi: its easy to get stuck in midway and slowly ascendand it is possible to reach very top and slowly descend
 eulerscheZahl: spam submit till lucky start
 dbf: I was banned for several minutes of submits yesterday..
 struct: I think its like 20 per hour max
 struct: isnt it?
 thethiny: oh there's a limit?
 [Csongor]: You can time out if your program is not optimized enough, right?
 thethiny: Guys lol it showed that I lost a battle in arena
 thethiny: I pressed play and I won
 thethiny: in the arena
 WINWINWIN: [Csongor] yes you can
 WINWINWIN: but only if you have something VERY time heavy
 eulerscheZahl: pretty easy to timeout
 [Csongor]: Is pathfinding from every player to every field of the map every turn heavy?
 thethiny: yes
 eulerscheZahl: no
 thethiny: in c++ no
 [Csongor]: but if you do a different pathfinding every time (js)
 jdyerjdyer: Well, 168 LOC (and the last letter doesn't stand for code) and I'm in Bronze, hovering around 1600 with 70% of battles done. Now I need some sleep and I only have one day to complete a project I estimated at 2 days...Extra features are going to be minimal...At least I got something accomplished today, but was it the right thing...IDK...
 WINWINWIN: Nearly 4900 players so far, Will it hit 5K?
 eulerscheZahl: number is increasing slower
 thethiny: I don't think 100 people will come in the last 1 day
 thethiny: I can beat clyde 140-85 yet I'm stuck in low (bad) silver
 thethiny: look like I always time out in 35x17 maps
 thethiny: which is once every 10 matches
 thethiny: Now I'm stuck at #75 cuz of the time outs
 thethiny: damn
 eulerscheZahl: then you know what to do next: get rid of the timeouts
 thethiny: I can't cuz I'm timing out in the flood fill 
 thethiny: already optimized the hell out of it
 eulerscheZahl: i doubt
 thethiny: suggestions then?
 eulerscheZahl: which language?
 Doju: even if you're using python you shouldn't be timing out
 thethiny: python
 thethiny: the time outs are so random
 eulerscheZahl: hm, is it ok to share the BFS here?
 eulerscheZahl: quite generic snippet, i'm not sure
 thethiny: let me see
 darkhorse64: Share the playground or redblobgames
 eulerscheZahl: i mean for us to see his code
 Cappefra: eulerscheZahl idk but it's a pretty easy google so I don't see the harm in it
 Cappefra: oh ok
 Cappefra: no idea
 Doju: yeah well you can find bfs code anywhere
 Doju: if you just google
 eulerscheZahl: ok, just do it :see_no_evil:
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/RksDXaB">https://imgur.com/a/RksDXaB</a>
 thethiny: here is the code
 Doju: don't have your visited as deque
 Doju: that should be a set
 eulerscheZahl: or boolean array
 Doju: also what on earth is happening there
 Doju: you're doing it from every neighbor
 thethiny: "Visited" contain the nodes (tails) only
 thethiny: so it's quite small
 ashikujjaman: what the uparrow and downarrow means in leadboard?
 thethiny: @Doju the inner loop is done for every neighbor
 Doju: oh right, you're doing the recursive thing
 Doju: i see
 Doju: wait, aren't you doing, umm
 Doju: basically depth first and every path has a max length of self.max_length
 Doju: self.MAX_STEPS, sorry
 eulerscheZahl: the recursion seems very weird to me, considering that it's supposed to be BFS, not DFS
 thethiny: but it's doing the BFS as intended?
 thethiny: I can see that when I project the grid
 Doju: its dfs but has the same outcome as bfs
 Doju: except that you're doing it super far
 Doju: for every path
 Doju: i think
 thethiny: okay so I realized that I sent the wrong function
 thethiny: I need to change my naming scheme
 thethiny: the function I sent is working fine ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/imNiB5c">https://imgur.com/imNiB5c</a>
 thethiny: this is the one timeing out ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
 Doju: now that looks like a bfs
 thethiny: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
 Nerchio: i dont get this challenge i submit i end up at like 80 place and after many hours i am top18
 Nerchio: why
 Doju: i'm very confused by your use of a deque as the visited
 eulerscheZahl: because win rate is too close to 50% to climb quickly
 thethiny: I tried list and deque and I found deque to be faster
 Nerchio: submiting in gold feels bad because of it euler :D
 Cappefra: yeah submitting in gold is awful&#160;:(
 Cappefra: unless you have legendary code that is 
 eulerscheZahl: one small speedup thethiny: get_adjacents should not return walls. just cache a list of neighbors that you compute once
 thethiny: question, does the first turn include the first playable turn as well?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know if you loop over all 4 directions or have a list stored at least
 eulerscheZahl: 1st turn is until your first line of output
 thethiny: how do you mean by caching a list of neighbors?
 thethiny: like store the neighbor for every node in advance?
 Cappefra: yeah exactly
 Cappefra: that will help
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/139d3cba-6302-4c05-817b-ba1a05cec202">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/139d3cba-6302-4c05-817b-ba1a05cec202</a>
 Cappefra: I use an algorithm similar to yours at the very start of the game and it does it in 20 ms, idk if maybe in python it would take close to 50 ms
 thethiny: hmmm, so basically you're storing the neighbors that aren't walls in advance
 Cappefra: thing is I'm not using it every turn because the purpose of my algorithm is to store the distance from every node to eich other
 thethiny: so that you skip it the next time
 eulerscheZahl: yes, faster looping
 eulerscheZahl: and you can remove 1 check in the BFS. there is no -1 anymore
 Doju: Also I think you're upping the depth by one for every neighbor
 thethiny: since it no longer is counted
 thethiny: I can just remove it altogether cuz of the check after it
 thethiny:&#160;!= 999
 thethiny: oh no nvm
 Doju: wait nevermind, no you're not
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm not sure about that BFSPoint. seems you are spamming new objects
 Doju: also why are you even doing the&#160;!= 999 thing?
 thethiny:                 if grid[point.y][point.x] == -1:
 thethiny: this is repetitive
 kovi: t1024 has huge lead
 eulerscheZahl: writing the distance into an array (class member of that point) would be fater
 eulerscheZahl: time to rage quit
 eulerscheZahl: someone asked me to sell my code, should have accepted the offer :D
 Cappefra: kovi hungarians seem great at this
 Cappefra: my wife is proud
 thethiny: @Doju it means visited
 Nerchio: really euleR? :D
 eulerscheZahl: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: can you sell me your code&#160;? my school promise us to give a prize for the first 3 student and i need that prize so much please bro help me
 thethiny: hahahaha
 Nerchio: lol
 Cappefra: hahahaha
 thethiny: @eulerscheZahl removing my debug prints solves my timeouts
 Csipcsirip: yeah he asked me as well. Is he an anti cheat bot by cg&#160;? :D 
 eulerscheZahl: debug prints, classic :D
 thethiny: that's cuz I didn't know first turn means first output I thought until I read input
 thethiny: damn
 Nerchio: yea yuo cant have too many printouts
 thethiny: time to re submit :D
 eulerscheZahl: to much error in general makes you timeout. and the first turn ends after you print to stdout
 Doju: thethiny oh i had the same thing lmao
 thethiny: I'm climbing up faster now :D
 Cappefra: looks like my biggest weakness is getting eaten
 Cappefra: no idea what to do about that anymore
 Nerchio: roll the dice
 Adnmaster: make your pacs switch if an enemy is near
 Cappefra: Nerchio now I'll fight you and come back victoriously with a replay where I win 
 Cappefra: be back in half an hour
 thethiny: üòÇ
 Durkin: haven't actually used a switch command yet
 Adnmaster: i use it to make my enemy dead if he comes at me
 thethiny: oh wow rank #18
 Cappefra: I need to play a bit with my eval function
 Adnmaster: what does eval() do?
 thethiny: battles in progress 44% and rank 37
 thethiny: fingers crossed
 Cappefra: Adnmaster it's not a built-in function
 eulerscheZahl: eval() executes code passed as a string
 Adnmaster: oh
 eulerscheZahl: eval is built in. at least in python and javascript
 Cappefra: oh ok
 Adnmaster: let me look it up on google
 Cappefra: then I didn't mean that eval lol
 Cappefra: I meant my evaluation function
 BenWo: welp, I give up
 eulerscheZahl: F12, go to consoleeval("3+4")prints 7
 Adnmaster: hey eval is awesome!
 Adnmaster: why didn't i use it before...
 Cappefra: seems safe! :D
 Doju: It's kind of sketchy though Adnmaster
 thethiny: what would eval help in?
 Doju: why would you need to use that?
 Adnmaster: not really, but still seems like a function i could use somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: to load code dynamically
 Doju: hm
 thethiny: example maybe?
 Cappefra: Nerchio HA! MADE IT
 Cappefra: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466127450">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466127450</a>
 Doju: wouldn't something like dictionaries be better for that?
 Cappefra: it only took like 15 tries
 Adnmaster: yeah, you are right
 Cappefra: does anyone else get the feeling if they watch the last battles outcome during the submit it'll be worse? haha
 thethiny: @Doju oh nice I'm close to you now
 Doju: nice
 Cappefra: uh this actually looks like a promising submit
 Cappefra: went up 150 places at 7%
 thethiny: damn I was 16 for a sec
 thethiny: then Doju disappeared
 Doju:&#160;?
 thethiny: you were 19
 thethiny: now you're gone
 Doju: Oh, right.
 Doju: i'm redoing my pellet gathering system atm
 Neumann: Are there any people in top 30 legend with small depth search&#160;? (&lt;4)
 Doju: because the old one was insanely simple and naive
 Doju: i think i'll get to gold ez pz with the new system once it's done
 Doju: (in a few hours, prolly)
 thethiny: good luck
 Doju: ty
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you would need to ask all top30 players to find out
 Cappefra: I spoke too soon, I'm back where I was
 Neumann: eulerscheZahl: let's start with you :D
 eulerscheZahl: 6
 Neumann: Hum
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl you time out a lot
 eulerscheZahl: in the arena or IDE only?
 Neumann: MSmits is the kind of guy to use a small depth, I bet
 MSmits: in IDE I had like 10 crashes out of 100 games, but I just witnessed one in arena as well
 eulerscheZahl: then i should do something about it
 MSmits: Neumann my search depth is huge, but it doesnt help much
 Cappefra: by depth 6 you mean 6 pellets or 6 turns?
 eulerscheZahl: 6 turns
 MSmits: I can do depth 8, or 10, or 12, but it performs the same
 MSmits: which is, good
 Cappefra: ok so like 12 if you have speed
 MSmits: but i have other problems
 Neumann: No less than 8
 thethiny: I ranked up way higher just cuz I changed my heuristic from -5 on hostile enemies to -20
 eulerscheZahl: depth 8 is a little better offline. but too slow
 Neumann: Any tricks to break the top 30-40 limit besides good farming&#160;?
 thethiny: my depth search is 9
 eulerscheZahl: why do you want to know Neumann? having a low depth yourself and curious if that's what it takes?
 thethiny: when it's &gt; 2 pacs it's 8
 Neumann: eulerscheZahl: yes, currently depth 4
 Neumann: Going further would require a major rework
 Neumann: I am wondering if depth 4 can do better by working on other aspects of the game
 Peudoki: the trick is always good farming
 eulerscheZahl: and that's exactly where i fail&#160;:(
 MSmits: I fail everywhere else :P
 Neumann: What about enemy tracking&#160;? Is going full farm always better than being extra cautious&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: tracking helps to know where to farm
 Peudoki: being cautios based on tracking is hard to pull off
 Peudoki: but watch some Romka games
 Neumann: Ok, tracking what pellets could have been gone. But what about tracking "the enemies at the corner"
 MSmits: for me, full farm seems to be the only thing that works. Every time i try to factor in opponents, my bot gets worse Neumann. But that's mostly because I havent found a good way
 wereii: are there any limits on threading/async stuff? dunno if that could be used for some of these games but just thinkin
 thethiny: after our battles are over, do we get to battle Clyde?
 jdyerjdyer: My pacs hurt. They be so dense. I'm out of time now. So much for reaching past bronze in this contest. Thanks anyway. Anyone else's head hurt?
 thethiny: or only during the progression?
 Adnmaster: my head is explode
 Csipcsirip: have an other pac, which sees  through the corner Neumann :p 
 jdyerjdyer: The rules seemed to go from easy to okay to global thermo nuclear war.
 Neumann: Csipcsirip: I always forget about the x-rays
 Neumann:  /flip
 jdyerjdyer: "Sometimes the only winning move is not to play." lol
 Cappefra: MSmits same for me! I'm glad to hear that, means I can still climb a lot if I keep working on my farm
 eulerscheZahl: knowing the enemy around the corner can help
 eulerscheZahl: sadly CG deleted some replays already that i wanted to share
 eulerscheZahl: i intentionally change my direction when i predict the enemy to walk around the corner, not seeing me
 eulerscheZahl: sneaky ninja kill
 Neumann: Sweet
 Doju: That's pretty neat eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: yes Cappefra, my farm bot that came in 2nd on monday, basically got to legend without any modifications, the bot sees all opponents it cant ignore safely as blocks and otherwise just farms
 jdyerjdyer: Probably didn't help that I've only had the 12 hours from today that I sort of stole from other projects to try this contest. I'll still meet deadlines, but one of them is going to be tight. lol
 jdyerjdyer: Anyway, my bed calls to me at least for the 3 and 1/2 hours I can spare tonight. Best of luck everyone. One of these days I'll get to participate without any conflicts....at least one can hope. G'nite!
 Cappefra: MSmits that's great, I'm trying to improve my farming but it seems like all my submits now are only doing worse
 Cappefra: best I've made was 150 gold with the same exact code that got me to 350 just 15 minutes before
 MSmits: ah yes... dont use the submission as a measurement
 MSmits: try playing 100 games vs yourself or something
 MSmits: with random seeds
 Nerchio: so who do i get enemy id?
 MSmits: you mean arena id?
 Nerchio: agentId
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/Nerchio">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/Nerchio</a>
 MSmits: I always get it from there
 Nerchio: thanks
 Nerchio: so can't get a boss then?
 MSmits: there is a way to do it in cg bench
 MSmits: i forgot how
 MSmits: someone else will know
 Neumann: -2
 Neumann: Is the ID of the boss of your current league
 MSmits: helps to have the creator in chat :P
 Neumann: Or use 2941103, it's the gold boss
 Cappefra: 51% win rate fml
 MSmits: I still use your tool a lot Neumann, thanks for making that. Wouldn't have any nr 1's in any arena if I couldnt test my bots like that
 Neumann: :D
 Cappefra: what do you do with the agentId?
 MSmits: it's your opponent
 MSmits: it's like playing in the IDE
 MSmits: only without the browser
 Neumann: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark</a>
 Cappefra: it uses the submitted code then?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: you provide it code
 MSmits: a file
 MSmits: so you can test without submitting. however, it does get in your play "slot"
 eulerscheZahl: there used to be a browser addon too. but it stopped working long ago
 eulerscheZahl: CG spunk
 MSmits: dont forget that, or the next time you submit, it will be your test that gets submitted
 Cappefra: oh wait I only opened the stat tool
 Cappefra: thanks guys
 thethiny: @AIshock it's funny how our pacs print the exact same messages
 thethiny: it's like we think the same
 Nerchio: playing against myself is completely useless in this gae
 Nerchio: its a draw 99% of the time :p
 dbf: just play 1k games to see the diff
 Nerchio: haha damn
 Nerchio: poor servers
 eulerscheZahl: Neumann i found one of those kills i was talking about: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466153064">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466153064</a>
 eulerscheZahl: didn't help in the end
 thethiny: I submitted 5 times in 5 minutes
 thethiny: I hope I won't get submit ban
 eulerscheZahl: first you get captchas
 Doju: It's just the stupidest bugs that take the longest to find...
 thethiny: @Doju our first and only fight<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466156924">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466156924</a>
 Doju: i was looking for this for like 25 mins:
 Doju: cell.dists = [array of numbers]
 Doju: for dist in cell.distances:
 Doju: "NoneType is not iterable"
 thethiny: lol
 thethiny: Collided with enemy with the same type!!!Enemy at (16, 9) of type DEADSwitch to None
 eulerscheZahl: python...
 Doju: xD thethiny
 eulerscheZahl: every compiled language would tell you what's wrong instantly
 thethiny: I didn't handle DEAD yet
 thethiny: @euler that's why I love C++, but it's not good for competitions
 Doju: thethiny look at the leaderboard
 Doju: Oh this is gonna get expensive...
 thethiny: whtat's with it
 thethiny: Oh I meant
 thethiny: not good for me
 Doju: ok
 thethiny: since I don't like handling dynamic arrays
 thethiny: which is what competitions are good at
 Doju: god damn
 Doju: i wrote some fancy recursive collaboration code
 Doju: and i'll time out if i use my fancy new logic
 thethiny: oh nice
 Doju: with that
 Doju: ...
 thethiny: oh not nice
 thethiny: turns are taking me 3ms
 thethiny: but the first turn goes up to 1.1s
 Doju: o.o
 Doju: Or i guess i'll at least try
 Doju: maybe i time out maybe i dont
 Doju: if i do i'll have to make this smarter
 thethiny: Can't I just beat clyde to advance?
 Doju: Nope
 thethiny: Do I really have to play others?
 thethiny: I mean I always beat him
 Doju:&#160;:/
 Doju: Hmm i got some fancy new probability things working
 Doju: Now i have other numbers on my grid than 1 and 9 :D
 BenWo: cool XD
 BenWo: yep, me two days ago beats me today
 BenWo: usually badly
 thethiny: I beat Clyde 3 times in a row
 thethiny: then lost to EdgeCase 3 times
 thethiny: I'm 2nd now
 Cappefra: what's the multiName for this contest? I don't see any in the IDE URL
 Cappefra: Also I suppose as language I should tip C\# cause # are comments?
 EdgeCase: @thethiny: sorry, I guess&#160;:)
 thethiny: GOLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
 Doju: gratz
 thethiny: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
 thethiny: THANKS HOPE YOU'RE NEXT!
 thethiny: I can beat the bot
 Doju: :o
 Doju: 1k in silver exactly
 thethiny: I'm winning in goldddddd
 thethiny: I can beat the boss of gold at least XD
 thethiny: oh god promotion in gold is 1 by 1
 thethiny: that's it
 thethiny: my life is now complete
 thethiny: Goodnight y'all cya next competition
 eulerscheZahl: legend is open already
 thethiny: I know
 thethiny: but I know I'm not that skilled yet
 eulerscheZahl: only on league opening you have a larger promotion wave
 thethiny: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: MSmitsgames parsed: 48     timeouts found: 0
 duckquackduck: gratz @thethiny
 eulerscheZahl: feel free to change my ID in your batch
 eulerscheZahl: or test against a stronger opponent
 Cappefra: ... I can't use the benchmark tool cause stupid me made his first login with facebook years ago
 Cappefra: can't I switch to a different login type?
 eulerscheZahl: go to password reset
 Cappefra: there it wants my current password which is always wrong cause it's not a CG password
 thethiny: @duckquackduck thanks
 eulerscheZahl: ask dbdr, he managed to change the login mode
 eulerscheZahl: i created a real account in the beginning
 dbdr: "I forgot my password"
 Cappefra: oh, right lol
 Cappefra: thanks guys
 dbdr: sorry, won't answer much, in the zone... it might fail miserably, but right now it feels right, so I gotta try&#160;:)
 thethiny: I stand no chance in gold lol
 ashikujjaman: what the arrow sign means i leadboard?
 Doju: grid.magic_values
 Doju: this is destined to work
 thethiny: No idea
 thethiny: I don't even understand why my score gets lower the higher I get
 Doju: ashikujjaman i think it means your rank has risen
 Cappefra: ashikujjaman that's if your points have gone up or down since last change
 Doju: or fallen
 ashikujjaman: means Up arrow means rank up?
 thethiny: yess
 Cappefra: eulerscheZahl sorry to bother again but do you know what the multiName is here? the comment says it should be in the URL of the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's 27865409fb226e2168e5d4fd038280cab4e3aa9b
 thethiny: Guys I didn't notice the rules change from gold to silver
 eulerscheZahl: yours is different
 Cappefra: oh ok it's a seed, I thought it should be something like SpringChallenge2020
 ashikujjaman: I got 101 rank in silver league my previous rank was 850 But my arrow is down and the value is 23.23:sweat:
 eulerscheZahl: just hit play and have a close look at the traffic this generates. then you see the requests and game id&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: or just copy from the URL now that I tell you, way easier
 Cappefra: thanks
 Nerchio: its spring-challenge-2020 cappefra
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I did find a win vs you in last battles where you timed out on frame 3. But it might be rare then
 MSmits: I guess mostly an IDE issue
 MSmits: it's gone now, so i cant prove it
 Csipcsirip: yeah euler times out in ide quiet often
 WINWINWIN: Should be difficult to optimizze in the top
 eulerscheZahl: C# has release mode now
 eulerscheZahl: so i'm the next dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: IMO it would be the best to use the precompiled bots in the IDE too, when i chose from the leaderboard rather than my IDE code
 struct: ^
 eulerscheZahl: 1 timeout in 151 matches now
 thethiny: that's good
 eulerscheZahl: good enough considering that i was at 5 out of 80
 WINWINWIN: Why are there timeouts?
 eulerscheZahl: because i fail to respond in 50ms
 WINWINWIN: But how come it does not happen consistently then?
 eulerscheZahl: now i execute some code in turn 1, even if i only need it in turn 2. because of warmup
 eulerscheZahl: because i'm close to 50ms. either i get lucky or unlucky
 struct: how much faster is release mode euler?
 WINWINWIN: K, not a problem that people like me have to worry about then&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: I berely touch 20ms as I really dont have much
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't measured
 eulerscheZahl: could check mean max now. i resubmitted when my bot was broken due to the update
 eulerscheZahl: sim count in arena (see my messages) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458176616">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458176616</a>
 eulerscheZahl: IDE <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466200123">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466200123</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i know there are different servers. maybe i got a fast one in the arena and slow in the IDE.but still a notable difference that can't by explained by the hardware alone i think
 thethiny: BTW The push that pushed me from Silver to Gold was that I gave corners less value than normal pellets.
 Doju: Alright
 Doju: i'm only now assigning real values to pellets. lets see how it goes
 Doju: should be ready-to-test in just a bit
 thethiny: I'm assigning 0.8 to all pellets
 Doju: o.o
 thethiny: and 1 if in the seen pellets
 Doju: Aha i see
 thethiny: so that I prefer a path I've seen than one I didn't
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aabc0289-f3eb-41f7-8469-84deddcfab09">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aabc0289-f3eb-41f7-8469-84deddcfab09</a>
 thethiny: and since I don't need corners anymore I got rid of the function
 thethiny: and saved 20ms
 WINWINWIN: thethiny why are corner pacs worth less?
 thethiny: because when u pick them u have to go back
 thethiny: so you lost 1 step
 WINWINWIN: K, thanks
 Doju: thethiny i think that should come naturally from the way i'm making my magic math
 Doju: once i get that implemented
 thethiny: good luck
 Doju: ty
 thethiny: goodnight
 Doju: night
 Dr-D: (mid day here&#160;;) )
 thethiny: same here
 thethiny: it's 2PM
 eulerscheZahl: then have a good lunch
 Doju: wwhhat
 thethiny: I am up since yesterday
 thethiny: working on this
 thethiny: cuz last day
 eulerscheZahl: still 22h
 thethiny: tomorrow I have work so I can't work on it
 Doju: how is there only a 1 hour time difference between finland and the uae
 thethiny: we're GMT+4
 avdg: hi
 avdg: (yep, not working on my bot, but trying to experiment with rust now)
 Doju: hey avdg
 avdg: I'm more interested in computer arch now :p dipping myself a bit into
 avdg: branch prediction is amazing
 avdg: (if done correctly, without known bloats)
 kovi: cmon euler, the other toad is ahead
 eulerscheZahl: i broke my bot but right now i don't see where
 eulerscheZahl: my version from yesterday is stronger according to offline testing
 dbf: do a binary search on your commit log
 WINWINWIN: How are you doing offline testing eulerscheZahl?
 struct: WINWINWIN <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark</a>
 WINWINWIN: thanks struct
 Cappefra: I keep getting internal error with that tool, idk where my config is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: that's not offline testing
 Cappefra: it goes [   SEED 0 ] ERROR Internal error
 eulerscheZahl: i downloaded the repo and modified the main class to use my own bots
 eulerscheZahl: i don't use CG Benchmark
 WINWINWIN: How many games do you compare against yourself eulerscheZahl?
 WINWINWIN: And is there anyway where I can find out how to do that?
 MSmits: Cappefra you cant use the IDE while testing with cg benchmark
 PippiCoder: Did any of you reach the top?
 MSmits: cg benchmark hijacks your play button basically
 PippiCoder: Legend league
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: every single one talking here is either in legend or in gold
 eulerscheZahl: couple 100
 Dr-D: &lt;- bronce
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: not me
 WINWINWIN: How did you find out how to do that?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i am in bronze
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: observation
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i read to get more insight on how others are tackling problem
 Dr-D: (cant even write the metal name properly ..)
 MSmits: WINWINWIN, they are just good with java. And compiling java programs. 
 WINWINWIN: Thanks MSmits
 WINWINWIN: So no way I can do it then&#160;:(
 MSmits: sometimes someone shares a brutaltester referee which uses a modified contest referee. You need to make some small modificiation to it to use the brutaltester referee
 MSmits: I didnt bother askign anyone for one this time around
 MSmits: as I didnt see much value in self-testing
 MSmits: cg benchmark makes more sense
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even use brutaltester
 MSmits: I know, but you use something similar I am guessing
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl, so all you did was modify the gamerunner.addagent line?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, basically
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1de0264-e28a-4ea0-ab6d-571ef0dab640">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1de0264-e28a-4ea0-ab6d-571ef0dab640</a>
 WINWINWIN: Thanks eulerscheZahl!, Can I run this on BlueJ as it is the Ide that I use for school?
 eulerscheZahl: BlueJ :D
 eulerscheZahl: i can't take that IDE seriously
 Hvosten: Fifth in silver. I will never advance to gold :D
 eulerscheZahl: get eclipse or IntelliJ
 WINWINWIN: :D It is what we use for school
 WINWINWIN: Thanks, will try that now
 MSmits: sometimes a worse IDE is a better IDE
 eulerscheZahl: and it's a toy for kiddies, nothing to do real work with
 MSmits: thats what i mean, the kiddies dont want to look at all the advanced stuff&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you click some parts and can't even edit some lines
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: CyberLemonade was using it too
 WINWINWIN: Its that bad?

 kovi: nice top3
 WINWINWIN: This advises the use of BlueJ :D
 eulerscheZahl: " BlueJ is strongly recommendedfor its simplicity, ease of use and because it is verywell suited for an ‚Äòobjects first‚Äô approach"
 Dr-D: one to go, kovi
 eulerscheZahl: make your own opinion MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt2cl3lfmI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt2cl3lfmI</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i see it as an April fools joke
 MSmits: will check it out
 WINWINWIN: Is that guy serious??
 MSmits: what do you mean WINWINWIN
 eulerscheZahl: me?
 WINWINWIN: Not u eulerscheZahl, the guy making the video
 eulerscheZahl: i guess so
 MSmits: I can't hear an indian accent now and not think of the KitBoga scammer videos =/
 MSmits: they are awesome btw
 WINWINWIN: scambaiting?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: they all have the same accents, presumably Indian
 wlesavo: MSmits same but with jim browning
 MSmits: ah right there are multiple channels like that
 MSmits: but as for Bluej, seems like a legit attempt at simplifying the process for getting a working program in java for students new to programming. But it could have problems I would run into when giving it a serious try
 MSmits: it looks like what my colleague is using for his java class, but it might not be Bluej
 Doju: Yess its finally not throwing an error
 NickStahl: Doju, ready for gold!
 Doju: NickStahl I have to finish all the things first
 Doju: but for now it's looking decent
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466247497">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466247497</a>
 Doju: Oh i wasnt even using the probabilities oops
 Doju: xd
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't know that you watch KitBoga too MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: more entertaining than Jim Browning. But Jim achieves that a whole callcenter gets shut down and people arrested
 MSmits: i didnt watch  it until a week ago or so
 MSmits: sometimes you find new corners of the internet
 [Csongor]: Can you disable underlines from errors somehow?
 MSmits: oh and one time i was called by a similar scammer
 MSmits: very confusing
 MSmits: it was a woman with an indian accent that told me I had a problem with my computer and that I should turn it on
 MSmits: and she worked for microsoft (of course)
 eulerscheZahl: me too. told me that i have a windows virus. told him that i have a linux
 eulerscheZahl: then he kept telling me about an infected network
 MSmits: ah, I actually have windows, so I just told her I'll fix the problem myself :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i listed for a minute or 2. then i told him what his next steps would be (remote connect, event viewer, netstat, ...)
 Dr-D: How did you get any of those calls? I never got any of those calls O.o
 eulerscheZahl: he was like "then why are you wasting my time"?me: "you called me"he insulted me and then hung up
 MSmits: Dr-D randomly, not sure...  I never heard of these scams before that
 eulerscheZahl: random number? no idea
 MSmits: ah, cool, you pissed one off
 eulerscheZahl: achievement unlocked
 MSmits: If I knew it was a scammer I would have made more of an effort. I was too surprised
 MSmits: of course 5 min afterwards I did realize
 eulerscheZahl: was tempted to let him connect to a linux VM with weird configuration
 Dr-D: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e18ab760-570a-4d1a-8d61-7bf330386d73">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e18ab760-570a-4d1a-8d61-7bf330386d73</a>
 Dr-D: -.-
 eulerscheZahl: i3wm: you don't even know how to launch any program when seeing it for the first time
 eulerscheZahl: like the vim editor
 MSmits: Dr-D these scams are more technical than the spam mail javes Veitch handles
 MSmits: james
 <b>**Dr-D is too stupid to c&amp;p ..</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: basically they do things like, tell you're getting a  refund
 MSmits: then use teamviewer on your pc to open your bank. Then do some javascript to make you think you were refunded too much
 MSmits: then you have to give *them* money
 MSmits: usually with google play cards or something
 MSmits: so that there is no bank trace
 MSmits: only works on completely clueless people
 MSmits: but there are many of those
 lifetimeLearner007: Hi all, I'm trying to find closest enemy for switch. checking same x or same y isn't considering if there is a wall in between. Any suggestions?
 jrke: hey anybody can suggest me what can i do 
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466255043">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466255043</a>
 MSmits: though
 MSmits: your bot stopped after speed for 1 turn
 MSmits: frame 19
 MSmits: nah might just be non-sychronized
 lifetimeLearner007: no MSmits, the enemy pac has speed, so it looks like our pac stopped
 MSmits: hard to see
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: its difficult to see
 eulerscheZahl: this guy is quite fun to watch as well <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll-zBCtVfas">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll-zBCtVfas</a>
 lifetimeLearner007: any suggestions for my question above MSmits?
 [Csongor]: lifetimeLearner007 find path to enemy and use the length of the path as distance ( I do this)
 Doju: Oh come on...
 lifetimeLearner007: check path with what, [Csongor]?
 lifetimeLearner007: path length*
 Doju: np.average(single_dimensional_array, axis=0) seems to return the average along axis 1&#160;:(
 lifetimeLearner007: ok, u mean path length with dx or dy... got it... thanks
 Doju: Oh wait, nevermind
 Doju: i'm trying to index infinity, i think.
 MSmits: lifetimeLearner007 yeah just calculate the distance for each
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl it's funny indeed
 [Csongor]: So, is it possible to remove underlines from errors?
 Scarfield: "They're among us" xD
 Scarfield: nice link euler
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 MSmits: not as good as a video of kitboga keeping a scammer on the line for 4 hrs and make him watch while he redeems the google play codes or use the money to buy stuff on amazon :P
 MSmits: the rage is insane
 StepBack13: starting in 20 sec
 cguzman: @eulerscheZahl how is the code jam?
 eulerscheZahl: i failed
 cguzman: was difiicult?
 eulerscheZahl: difficult to me
 cguzman: no so easy like this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: just different
 PippiCoder: guys , how do you think I could "eat" an enemy pac, is there a number of tries?
 eulerscheZahl: i love kitbogas banking website with the security checks
 PippiCoder: I see some healthbar but cannot grab it as a number
 cguzman: at least you try it&#160;!
 cguzman: good luck with this contest
 EvModder: it's not a health bar, it's the cooldown for changing types&#160;:)
 Doju: PippiCoder that's not a health bar
 PippiCoder: Hmm shit
 PippiCoder: That explains xD
 PippiCoder: Can enemy pacs be eaten in the bronze league?
 Doju: uhhh
 Doju: i think so
 IAmNoob: hi:)
 Doju: yes
 Doju: if you beat them in rock paper scissors
 PippiCoder: Hmm
 PippiCoder: I see
 Doju: hi IAmNoob
 PippiCoder: It made me think
 PippiCoder: I can speed when I see them xD
 PippiCoder: And chase them
 Doju: perhaps
 MSmits: speed is often synchronized for a long time
 PippiCoder: What do you mean by that?
 PippiCoder: Synchronised how?
 MSmits: meaning all pacs chain-speed
 MSmits: they're all speeding at the same time
 MSmits: until something happens and they may need to switch
 MSmits: that de-synchronizes the speed
 PippiCoder: But the command is issued per pac, isn't it?
 PippiCoder: I mean speed boost
 MSmits: yes, they can all speed
 MSmits: the cooldown is per pac
 MSmits: so speed whenever you can unless there is a reason not to
 MSmits: for example, when an opponent has you trapped and can kill you
 SujalAI: Hi I am in wood 1 league
 PippiCoder: Hey SujalAI
 SujalAI: My program is timing out, I think it's because there are so many loops. Can you help me?
 PippiCoder: Do you have it on github somewhere?
 PippiCoder: I can
 MSmits: eh
 MSmits: you're definitely not supposed to have it on a public github
 SujalAI: No, I'll p[ut it on github now
 MSmits: thats against contest rules
 PippiCoder: I didn't know
 MSmits: we dont share code during contest
 SujalAI: It's just wood league and I'm finding the nearest pellet
 PippiCoder: I see
 MSmits: at most you can share a snippet to debug
 MSmits: but not whole bots
 SujalAI: Okay
 PippiCoder: I didn't know, sorry
 MSmits: in fact this rule is also true for multiplayer arena
 MSmits: no need to be sorry, i am just preventing problems&#160;:)
 Doju: Good guy MSmits
 PippiCoder: MSmits do you work here?
 MSmits: no
 eulerscheZahl: did he share already? i need some inspration
 MSmits: lol
 Doju: euler :D
 PippiCoder: Shit humor
 PippiCoder: lol
 PippiCoder: Its so dry I need to drink something
 jdyerjdyer: Who needs sleep when you can waste 4 extra hours hacking away at pos code only to watch your pacs do was making you go smh. I think I'm done. Can't seem to crack past 1500 in bronze. Brain fried. G'nite for real this time.
 jdyerjdyer: btw, was stands for "weird *** ****"
 jdyerjdyer: if that wasn't clear enough...lol
 MSmits: same for me jdyerjdyer also pretty much done, nothing worked all week after monday&#160;:(
 MSmits: but learned some new things at least
 MSmits: and gn
 wlesavo: MSmits that improvement also didnt work? 
 MSmits: opponent tracking? No not really
 MSmits: or opponent pellet prediction, or whatever you want to call it
 MSmits: it made things worse
 MSmits: as far as I could tell
 MSmits: its really hard to tell
 wlesavo: this is main problem for me, hard to tell if any one particular feature works

 IAmNoob: wtf
 ShannonNorris97: At the beginning of the contest I said I'd be really pleased with myself if I got into the top 500, but at this point I'm making such little progress that I'll be happy to get in the top 1000. I've got some stuff to learn
 IAmNoob: at what level do i reach gold?
 ShannonNorris97: When you beat the silver boss, which is around position 550 on the overall leaderboard
 IAmNoob: no no no no
 IAmNoob: at my level
 IAmNoob: i am now 23
 ShannonNorris97: ohh sorry, I'm not sure
 EvModder: MSmits i have been working on opponent tracking for the last 4 hours and i still don't think it's helping me at all
 EvModder: lol
 EvModder: so ik how you feel
 MSmits: yea, I started out liking this contest and I still think it's fine, but  my failure at making almost anything work well is getting to me  =/
 MSmits: after monday that is
 Cappefra: I feel exactly the same
 MSmits: ooc was also a very complicated contest, but it was a bit easier to see the result of your changes
 MSmits: oh... and the changes I did there actually helped&#160;:)
 JocelynL: I have learned one thing from this challenge: don't sacrifice unit tests because you want to go faster
 MSmits: good lesson for me also... my code is too much of a mess to work with now
 MSmits: not sure how many bugs it still has
 JocelynL: now every little change I make is hard because there are hidden bugs&#160;:(
 MSmits: I think most people feel that way atm
 MSmits: it's pretty common at end of contest, but this one is pretty bad in that regard
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:+1:
 JocelynL: it's easy to get ahead of yourself because you start with a very simple idea, so you think you don't need tests. And that's the beginning of the end
 JocelynL: of course in the professional world we would never do that :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: it's a fine line too... how much code do you write before doing the test. It's a different amount for everyone. I used to make more mistakes. I often write like 50-100 lines before a test now... probably too much
 Doju: please dont time out please dont time out
 Doju: nice, doesn't time out
 Doju: Maybe it's time to submit this
 Doju: no timeouts pls
 PippiCoder: This website is fun in general
 PippiCoder: How do you find it compared to other ones like LeetCode?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just different. LeetCode, Codeforces and such offer puzzles that you can solve alone and get 100% correct
 MSmits: that seems more of a learning website
 eulerscheZahl: here you play a game. there is no "solved"/"finished"
 MSmits: CG has lots of learning related activities but seems more competitive
 eulerscheZahl: i think i confused leetcode with another site
 RockyMullet: is there a reliable to way to tell how many turns have passed&#160;? the speed kind of screw the simple way of incrementing a counter on each input
 MSmits: I guess the practice puzzles fit the criteria, but they give xp and are not really intended to be competitive
 avdg: Making testable code is more important than having tests (though if you do make a lot of errors, having tests are very valuable)
 MSmits: RockyMullet inside your sim or in the game?
 eulerscheZahl: somehow thought about atcoder, ignore me
 avdg: kinda tradeoff speed vs correctness
 RockyMullet: MSmits in the game
 MSmits: if in the game, just do turn++
 avdg: easy to not get it right
 MSmits: before you output
 RockyMullet: MSmits yeah ok, but it can be wrong
 eulerscheZahl: RockyMullet they fixed that bug. always 200 turns, not frames
 MSmits: why
 SAFAKKARAASLAN: selam beyler
 RockyMullet: if a single pac has speed, 2 turns pass
 eulerscheZahl: read my text
 MSmits: your game will still do one update turn of 50ms
 MSmits: or do you mean in the viewer?
 RockyMullet: oohhh ok thnx euler
 RockyMullet: I missed that
 RockyMullet: I just want like a "cap" where it's impossible the game go behond that point
 IAmNoob: AT WHAT LEVEL I REACH GOLD??
 RockyMullet: ONCE YOU BEAT THE SILVER BOSS
 eulerscheZahl: rank above the silver boss
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, forgot capslock
 IAmNoob: i am level 24 silver
 RockyMullet: oh ok you mean the levels
 IAmNoob: yeah
 RockyMullet: 30 I think
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: thx
 RockyMullet: np
 eulerscheZahl: OH THAT GOLD. 30 FOR GOLD, 40 FOR LEGEND
 IAmNoob: STFU
 eulerscheZahl: I NEED A BIGGER FONT
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 IAmNoob: OK GO BUY
 RockyMullet: someone does like jokes lol
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, you might be rank 1 again after contest right? I mean overall
 RockyMullet: ok last day, time to make my sim lol
 MSmits: seems Royal e in gold
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, didn't do the math
 MSmits: we'll see
 eulerscheZahl: fixed my bug, back to ~15and timing out again
 eulerscheZahl: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 eulerscheZahl: games parsed: 70     timeouts found: 5
 MSmits: I'm super close to counter balance on Dutch lb, hope this pushes me to rank 1 again 
 MSmits: he has a lot of points
 eulerscheZahl: for germany there isn't really any competition
 MSmits: right, you're just taking on France all by yourself
 eulerscheZahl: :crossed_swords:
 eulerscheZahl: new leader or lucky start?
 eulerscheZahl: 2 points ahead
 ShlOk: Hey i got 1st in many of clashes but still it shows 1 gold. And how to increse xp in this??
 RockyMullet: xp is for puzzles
 RockyMullet: and achievements
 MSmits: and some other stuff
 MSmits: mostly community related
 RockyMullet: anything involving other players gives CP
 IAmNoob: HOW DID eulerscheZahl MADE LEVEL 52, I AM ONLY LEVEL 24 AND DID LOTS OF HARD PUZZLES
 IAmNoob: AND VERY HARD\
 eulerscheZahl: i cheated. but pssst
 RockyMullet: he made multiplayer bots, gives you a lot of xp
 IAmNoob: now for real
 MSmits: he did almost all of them, and every contest since he joined and every arena. He's legend in all of them
 RockyMullet: like made the game I mean
 eulerscheZahl: not really. 250XP for a contribution that gets approved
 MSmits: the ones that have a legend that is
 eulerscheZahl: no matter of complex multiplayer or boring clash of code
 IAmNoob: ok ok ok, this mean i should work on my bot?
 MSmits: bot(s)
 RockyMullet: most of my XP comes from promoting in leagues
 eulerscheZahl: each wood-&gt; legend gives approx 1k XP
 RockyMullet: took me a while to reach lvl 30
 IAmNoob: MSmits what do u mean bot(s)
 MSmits: write 30 bots that get somewhere between rank 3 and 40 and you'll get near euler 
 eulerscheZahl: twice if you do it in contest + multiplayer in the past (changed now)
 MSmits: IAmNoob there are many multiplayer arenas
 IAmNoob: ok i did not know 
 IAmNoob: and this is how you guys make XP?
 MSmits: just check out:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 IAmNoob: ok thx
 eulerscheZahl: and don't underestimate upvotes
 MSmits: its where most of my xp comes from
 MSmits: but not all
 eulerscheZahl: space maze only gave me 250XP for approval. but &gt; 750XP for upvotes, was pending for ages
 MSmits: oh, nice
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html</a>
 ShlOk: Can u explain how Achievement showcase are calculated??
 wlesavo: space maze still on my list, looks really fun and really hard
 MSmits: wow I am ranked quite high in xp
 MSmits: did not know
 MSmits: only level 34
 eulerscheZahl: robo recently solved space maze. even in python
 wlesavo: wow
 wlesavo: so there is hope
 wlesavo: ill ggive it an honest try
 MSmits: seems more fulfilling if you do it in python. Means you wrote some great code
 MSmits: 
 eulerscheZahl: when i created it, i wasn't even sure if i should make it easier. i struggled to solve it with a faster language (C#)
 IAmNoob: MSmits in what language do u progeam?
 AntiSquid: lots confusion was caused by that and the dead pacs change
 MSmits: c++ now mostly, but I am more comfortable with C#. These days I almost always drop C# for a faster bot though
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll, wonderful
 AntiSquid: does top of legend still feel random?
 AntiSquid: just wonder if having well improved bot means more stable rank
 eulerscheZahl: there is some up and down
 Doju: How do you guys tweak variables?
 eulerscheZahl: but you can see that some players are stable in the top region
 Doju: It takes forever to submit
 eulerscheZahl: not at #1 or #2 all the time, but still somewhat stable in top5
 Kellthazar: howdy
 Doju: hey
 WINWINWIN: Who is the #1 in the XP leaderboard?
 WINWINWIN: Far ahead of euler
 eulerscheZahl: we don't knowbut it's possible to self-upvote. that's probably what happened
 eulerscheZahl: maybe in combination with a script
 Icebox: recalc still gonna flip everything upside down
 eulerscheZahl: create a private contribution, upvote yourself. +10XP
 WINWINWIN: Maybe, but how is he at a lower level that you?
 MSmits: upside down would be great :P
 WINWINWIN: Lvl 50
 eulerscheZahl: because lvl50 was the cap in the past
 eulerscheZahl: till i mentioned that i'm 51 actually
 eulerscheZahl: so they changed that. but only updates when you gain more XP
 WINWINWIN: Ok
 AntiSquid: isn't that just a test account of sorts as #1 on the xp leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: CG says it's not their account
 ShlOk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1223937c50b6c90bb8a5bd9249b29783e34f1ce">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1223937c50b6c90bb8a5bd9249b29783e34f1ce</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: why don't they remove all the "Unnamed Player" accounts? they are deleted anyway
 ShlOk: plssssssss
 AntiSquid: hey no clash links here
 WINWINWIN: Or did they just not provide a nickname?
 AntiSquid: not sure i didn't tell you already ShlOk
 ShlOk: Why??
 WINWINWIN: Its a spam
 AntiSquid: and don't beg people to join either, if they want to play it's ok, but harassing people to play, especially clash, is a big NO
 WINWINWIN: contest is more fun anyway
 ShlOk: Oh sorry did not know.
 Icebox: unless it's eulerscheZahl
 Icebox: you can always invite him
 Icebox: to play some clash
 Icebox: I've heard he's always happy to get invites
 eulerscheZahl: stupid "feature" of the platform
 AntiSquid: in private, not in chat
 WINWINWIN: :D Icebox
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl what's ur win rate against me
 cegprakash: u and me counter each other
 cegprakash: as I have anti accident and u cause accidents
 eulerscheZahl: how did you even reach legend?
 WINWINWIN: :D
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, you surprised me once more
 MSmits: it was an accident
 AntiSquid: i beat boss when he was at #2 and needed just a bit of extra 
 MSmits: how does that make you feel AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: idk
 cegprakash: AntiSquid will be proud
 MSmits: do you want to talk about it
 cegprakash: of his mate
 AntiSquid: well more like saving someone from a sinking ship while i am still drowning i guess MSmits
 cegprakash: when I win this contest
 MSmits: thats a good way to look at it I guess
 AntiSquid: lol ok ceg do it then 
 MSmits: AntiSquid maybe ceg will end 1 place above me and we can commiserate together AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: at least annoy people in top 10 legend with your bot 
 cegprakash: see I was above kovi 2 days back
 cegprakash: and kovi is #6 now
 cegprakash: first I'm gonna increase my simulations as it's so less 
 cegprakash: I only do like 1000 sims
 WINWINWIN: I thought CPP does not need to be optimized that much?
 AntiSquid: ok then not time to waste in chat ceg go do it
 AntiSquid: scramble the top 10
 MSmits: I get a million sims in turn 1 :P
 pde-bakk: What is legend like now? Are you just trying to counter the other top strategies?
 MSmits: dont need optimization no
 AntiSquid: i didn't write a sim this time
 AntiSquid: well not complete sim anyway
 Icebox: 1000 sims but 20 depth? :thinking:
 cegprakash: yes Icebox
 cegprakash: :D
 AntiSquid: feels like you're always forced to write a bloody sim
 pde-bakk: @MSmits Ill probably fail but im coming for that nr1 Dutch spot!&#160;;)
 cegprakash: + 1000 more for mutations
 eulerscheZahl: some like some aggressive pruning
 WINWINWIN: isnt 20000 pretty good cegprakash?
 lifetimeLearner007: seems it is not enough for him :p
 MSmits: pde-bakk you mean in legend or overall?
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN turn 1 sims doesn't matter
 cegprakash: u are going to speed anyways
 MSmits: in contest or overall i mean
 pde-bakk: overall
 pde-bakk: have yet to crack legend
 MSmits: oh ok
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, speed on turn 1, will try that
 cegprakash: no no don't enforce it
 cegprakash: sometimes u shouldn't speed
 MSmits: I dont really go for maximum CP usually. I spend much time on the same arena to get as high as possible. I have many games untouched
 lifetimeLearner007: how many sims r u getting in subsequent turns, cegprakash?
 cegprakash: have like a 99% probablity of speed
 cegprakash: or 90%
 cegprakash: on turn 1
 WINWINWIN: are you using the fact that the map is symmetric in tracking?
 MSmits: could probably get 20k cp in 2 weeks if i did some of these older ones
 cegprakash: told you only 1000 lifetimeLearner007
 lifetimeLearner007: ok, i thought it was for 1st turn
 Doju: I have no idea how to set my constants&#160;:(
 Doju: Seems like every combination is a losing one
 cegprakash: I have only 3 variables in my eval
 cegprakash: life, pellets and distance
 cegprakash: simple the better
 Doju: Well you have to give things weights at some point
 cegprakash: but only 3
 cegprakash: not as complex as other games
 Doju: ehh
 cegprakash: and I use floats
 Icebox: you can always simplify at the cost of performance
 Doju: i have weights for how much value pellets get from being close to other pellets, how much that should decrease at distance, how much should my pacs care about distance, how much my pacs care about uncertainty, how uncertain the pellets get
 Icebox: you could have literally 1 int: 1 for win state, 0 for not finished and -1 for loss state. With 200 depth you'd have a perfect bot
 Doju: i'm not simulating
 cegprakash: Icebox MCTS can do that
 cegprakash: MSmits is probably using MCTS
 cegprakash: :D
 WINWINWIN: Skrill taken a considerable lead
 Skril: Seems to be luck, will drop soon&#160;;-) 
 Doju: Seriously my old thing of "go to closest pellet unless a super pellet is within a reasonable distance" got me to rank 10 or something but this varies between rank 400 and 700
 Doju: maybe i'll just do that then
 cegprakash: oh sheet I just lost a beautiful seed
 tobk: aw, heck, Gold boss is random again..
 Doju: nooo
 Doju: oh, gold boss
 Doju: i dont care about that nevermind xd
 tobk: so much for "oh, why did my bot do this thing, let's add some debugging output and NOOOOOO!"
 ChooJeremy: Is there a way to increase the amount of text shown in the standard error stream?
 ChooJeremy: I'm printing 15 lines but only 3 are being displayed
 Icebox: there's a char limit
 Icebox: that you're probably hitting with your 3 lines
 Icebox: and no, there isn't
 ChooJeremy: Is there a way to increase the limit?
 ChooJeremy: oh
 WINWINWIN: @ChooJeremy You can copy paste the input for that turn into a local and run it
 WINWINWIN: that way you can see all lines
 ChooJeremy: That sounds painful
 ChooJeremy: but I'll try
 ChooJeremy: very painful actually
 ChooJeremy: need to emulate previous states&#160;:/
 WINWINWIN: :D MadKnight taught me that
 WINWINWIN: It is painful
 NickStahl: doju
 Doju: Yes?
 Nerchio: where can i provide seed to play on?
 eulerscheZahl: settings -&gt; expert mode
 NickStahl: Still no gold?&#160;:)
 Nerchio: i know i have it
 Nerchio: but where
 eulerscheZahl: then at the players selection: options -&gt; manual
 Doju: Still no gold... Trying to tweak the constant (of which i have rather many) NickStahl
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl when fixing timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: i thought i did?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466373018">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466373018</a>
 eulerscheZahl: games parsed: 113     timeouts found: 1
 eulerscheZahl: that's an IDE match, doesn't matter
 NickStahl: You will get it somehow! I believe in you&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: C# has release mode on submit. IDE crashes are fine
 Doju: constants* and i have no idea which way to tweak them
 cegprakash: why so aggressive eulerscheZahl give 2 ms for us
 cegprakash: u not letting us counteer u
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not using a timer
 eulerscheZahl: fixed search depth which works on submit
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes fails in the IDE
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: I have variable depth
 AntiSquid: doju at this points maybe just go to discord and watch the streamers, thibpat basically leaked pretty much most important bits, should get gold at least with that info
 AntiSquid: maybe it's enough for legend too
 Doju: AntiSquid hm, I don't really want to get there by copying others
 AntiSquid: you don't need to copy and i don't see how you can copy
 Doju: i think this is a good system but i just need to tweak it
 AntiSquid: just see the ideas leaked
 Doju: well yeah&#160;:/
 Cappefra: I don't get why it's not ok to put code on github but it is ok to stream it
 Cappefra: doesn't make any sense to me
 Doju: although i was already at like rank 10 with my stupid bot
 WINWINWIN: People like cegprakash only stream basic code
 Icebox: :D
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN that's because I don't want u stare me debug all the time
 cegprakash: It's not like I don't want to
 WINWINWIN: they keep the good code to themselve
 cegprakash: what nooooo that's not the intention
 WINWINWIN: cegprakash dont understand you?
 WINWINWIN: It should be&#160;:)
 cegprakash: u are saying I'm selfish?
 WINWINWIN: No, but it would be a disaster if you gave good ideas to others&#160;:)
 cegprakash: here u go
 cegprakash: my full strat so far
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/90f14917-187a-4a20-990b-ffed85e8e344">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/90f14917-187a-4a20-990b-ffed85e8e344</a>
 WINWINWIN: Cant implement it anyway&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i am doing all of that though
 AntiSquid: maybe bugged though, def not fully implemented
 lifetimeLearner007: me too, yet stuck in bronze. i guess there r mre bugs
 AntiSquid: ceg you have complete sim&#160;?
 cegprakash: yes AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: aha
 AntiSquid: i don't handle some corner cases 
 lifetimeLearner007: whats a complete sim? how is it different from normal sim?
 AntiSquid: define normal
 lifetimeLearner007: idk
 lifetimeLearner007: :P
 AntiSquid: then idk the answer to your question
 AntiSquid: is this some hidden info question? not in mood for one
 EvModder: hey AntiSquid how u doing&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: (riddle)
 AntiSquid: yes, never been better before, how are you
 lifetimeLearner007: when he said complete sim,  i thought mayb there are other kinds of sims. so asked.
 EvModder: doing good!
 AntiSquid: well my simulation is incomplete lifetimeLearner007
 AntiSquid: was hoping to cheese a higher rank easily
 Cappefra: I don't know what you mean by normal but I would say a complete sim is one where you don't make your move until you have simulated a turn in every aspect of it
 AntiSquid: because after playing ooc and utg back to back i am not 100% into playing another hidden info game
 Cappefra: meaning the opponents "moves" as well and so on
 Kellthazar: Is there any algo without simulations (pure heuristics) on legend?
 Cappefra: like my sim is not complete cause I don't take into account a bunch of things
 lifetimeLearner007: hmmm
 AntiSquid: mhm
 SujalAI: Can someone explain what's happening here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466384279">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466384279</a>
 SujalAI: I'm in wood 1
 WINWINWIN: What are your ouputs?
 AntiSquid: you're standing still most of your turns
 lifetimeLearner007: u r moving only 1 pac utmost
 AntiSquid: you can click ..... and check his outputs WINWINWIN
 Scarfield: you need to output like "MOVE 0 25 6|MOVE 1 1 3|MOVE 2 31 13"
 WINWINWIN: Is it a blank line or move to your own positions?
 pde-bakk: @SujaAI youre only moving 1 pac per turn, your 3 commands should be put on the same line and only a newline after that
 Scarfield: when you have more pacs, and you are telling your pacs to move to the cell they are already in somethimes
 AntiSquid: also most important detail people forgot to mention, you're losing the game
 WINWINWIN: :D
 EvModder: lol
 lifetimeLearner007: lol
 Scarfield: yes, dont lose, ez win
 SujalAI: Should the commands of all my pacs be on the same line?
 pde-bakk: yes
 Scarfield: yes same string
 Scarfield: MOVE 0 25 6|MOVE 1 1 3|MOVE 2 31 13
 WINWINWIN: Yes, joined by the Pipe symbol
 WINWINWIN: ' | '
 pde-bakk: like Scarfield said
 SujalAI: Oh no wonder
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 pde-bakk: you can also make them say something by doing MOVE 0 25 6 "msg"|MOVE 1 1 3 "msg"|MOVE 2 31 13 "msg

 SujalAI: can someone tell me what's wrong with this code:
 SujalAI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/38cf18fb-9310-4f6c-ad8b-ca67abb713b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/38cf18fb-9310-4f6c-ad8b-ca67abb713b1</a>
 Scarfield: dont know the language, but do you need the splice?
 SujalAI: I need to remove the final pipe symbol, that's what the splice is for
 SujalAI: It says move.splice is not a function
 RoboStac: you can have an extra | on the end without a problem
 SujalAI: Ok
 Neumann: Peudoki going strong
 SujalAI: The problem was that it should be slice not splice
 SujalAI: Can someone tell me why the top left pac behaves like this after turn 40:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466401736">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466401736</a>
 AntiSquid: extra | at the start works too
 SujalAI: My logic is that I just find the closest pellet
 RoboStac: because you are doing closest ignorning walls as you move towards one the other becomes closer
 RoboStac: so you move back
 AntiSquid: political sciences help with bot programming skills somehow :thinking: AutomatonNN what do you think
 SujalAI: Oh, how can I fix that?
 AutomatonNN: congratz
 ShlOk: @ Sujal kis grade me ho??
 pde-bakk: you could pathfind and save where your pac is expecting to move for example
 Scarfield: use a BFS function to find the nearest pellet. Essetially navigating areound the walls, finding the shortest path to the nearest pellet, and not just the one with the smallest "manhattan" distance
 SujalAI: @Shlok going to 9th standard
 ShlOk: i m in 10th
 SujalAI: What's a BFS function?
 Scarfield: google it&#160;:) but breadth first search
 ShlOk: @ Sujal kitne saal se coding kr rhe??
 AntiSquid: please click #in for indian chat
 SujalAI: @Shlok come to indian chat
 AntiSquid: oh that's still  english, nvm i forget india has lots of languages
 MattSOrme: I can beat the gold boss, but the players between me and the boss are being a pain and not letting me win
 Braykin08: I feel the same. currently 14th, more win than losses, but won't get up
 Scarfield: yea the leaderboard gets weird often, yesterday i was 150th in bronze, logged in today to be 500th in silver lol
 SujalAI: @Scarfield can I use A* instead of BFS
 AntiSquid: gold boss isn't strongest boss in gold :D
 AntiSquid: strongest bot *
 wlesavo: im beating #1 sometimes but this players in  legend so annoying, dont let me to come up there and beat him
 Scarfield: i never used a* myself, but BFS should be simpler, and no need to use a* for such small a grid as this as far as i knoe
 Scarfield: know*
 MattSOrme: Do some people have something like enemy play style detection? Feel like that would only work, if you could store data across games, and you played the same person multiple times
 SujalAI: Will it time out if I use BFS, since it scan the whole area
 Doju: It won't
 Doju: as long as you do it right
 Braykin08: I guess any online requests will take too long haha. Maybe in the first 1000ms
 MattSOrme: I implemented 1 BFS that would go until i timed it out. Then i re-implemented it and now its 0-2ms
 NickStahl: MattSOrme you could check how your opponent reacts in the first few rounds and change your strategy for the later rounds in case same situation occurs again. But not sure if it's easy to implement&#160;:)
 MSmits: MattSOrme play style detection is rare, but happens sometimes in contests
 MSmits: last contest some people detected whether someone only did 0 distance silences (you could go up to 4), in that case it was easy to track them
 MSmits: but you cant store data between battles
 MSmits: so it has to happen during the course of the game
 Braykin08: I have some persistent data in a game to see how you handle collisions, i.e. do you let them pass or keep bumping or do you switch to the stronger/weaker type.
 eulerscheZahl: *cough* botters of the galaxy *cough*
 MSmits: never done that yet
 Icebox: I actually had a very good playstyle detection in CR
 MattSOrme: yeah, its not something im gonna do. But would be interesting if someone is tracking enemies who "counter-switch" for example and using that against them
 Braykin08: I do it then.
 MSmits: Code royale Icebox?
 Icebox: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: crystal rush
 Icebox: code royale
 eulerscheZahl: crystal rush
 RoboStac: actually both were places where it was pretty useful
 Icebox: completely different heuristics for people using giants, for people spamming towers etc
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm just trolling
 Scarfield: should trolling be recharacterised as frogging :thinking:
 MSmits: Icebox sounds good. My bot was mostly hardcoded build orders  + knight avoidance code.  I didn't do fancy stuff like that
 tobk: oh my, just implemented trapping, but now my last submit (which was probably a rather lucky one) is slowly creeping up Gold... resubmit or just wait? :anguished:
 MSmits: it's still safe to submit i think. Plenty of creeping left to come
 MSmits: besides you'll be more sorry if you never submitted this code
 tobk: first submit of that bot was G70, second G250, third G50
 Braykin08: In 17h hours, will the submit stop but playing continue for a bit, or will the standing at that time be the final one?
 tobk: crept up to G30 from yesterday evening and to G20 while I was coding the new feature
 MSmits: all submits will end first
 MSmits: then the standign will be final for gold and down
 RoboStac: it'll wait till everyone hits 100% and then lots of extra games will play in legend
 MSmits: top 100 legend will be recalculated i think? Or the full legend?
 Braykin08: It's the same thing lol
 MSmits: it is now
 AntiSquid: 89 legend wow .
 SujalAI: Can someone give me a strat for bronze
 pde-bakk: full legend i believe
 eulerscheZahl: min(100, legend size)
 tobk: beating bronze or getting into it?
 Braykin08: Man, 13th in gold. Gotta get that legend
 MSmits: ah, i remembered correctly then
 SujalAI: beating bronze
 MSmits: 13th can be very far away from boss. Whats the rating difference Braykin08?
 eulerscheZahl: did it on spot when i broke my BotG bot: 98 before recalc
 Braykin08: about 2 points
 MSmits: not that far then
 MSmits: you do still need some improvement to beat him though
 Braykin08: 26.61 to 24.82
 Braykin08: Working on it lol
 SujalAI: Can someone tell me how to beat bronze
 MattSOrme: ugh, another random enemy that i have to repeat until it hits the same crash
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl your final botg bot was broken?
 MSmits: or did you contribute?
 eulerscheZahl: kill switch
 ZarthaxX: 1.8
 Yasser: isn't anyone having an issue with compilation??I see the test results are negative without showing what's the error..Then when I send it to IDE, it works.
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to see how far i can climb in the recalc if i start low
 eulerscheZahl: my actual rank was around 40
 MSmits: how far did you climb?
 eulerscheZahl: went from 98 to 73 i think
 MSmits: sad
 eulerscheZahl: for the science :D
 MSmits: that's what i'll say if i end bottom legend
 MSmits: it's all science
 eulerscheZahl: but that game was random, hard to tell if bad recalc. i did poorly against meele opponents
 eulerscheZahl: and when there are a lot of them in your range...
 MSmits: how much lines of code for that game?
 MSmits: many
 eulerscheZahl: botg?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i seem to remember you guys saying the sim is very big
 AntiSquid: probably need the contest to run for longer
 eulerscheZahl: 597 lines
 AntiSquid: locm got its month
 MSmits: oh nice, thats not much for you at all
 MSmits: noone spent a month on locam
 eulerscheZahl: i would have rage quitted
 eulerscheZahl: actually i did at the end of botg
 MSmits: I was in the Efteling for a quarter of locam&#160;:)
 Yasser: @codingame
 MSmits: thinking of draw orders while upside down in a rollercoaster
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: the rollercoaster wasn't intense enough then i guess
 MSmits: or maybe draw orders were really compelling
 AntiSquid: or you were trying to think of something else to look less scared?
 MattSOrme: i don't even see any glaring bugs in what i've submitted, so just gonna submit again haha. need more matches to check
 MSmits: hehe nah, they dont scare me, they hurt me mostly and I get queasy
 MattSOrme: Theres def improvement, but too advanced for what i can be bothered with today
 AntiSquid: do you remember the name of the coaster MSmits&#160;?

 MSmits: he's suggesting something you can already do through github
 MSmits: even though thats not allowed
 eulerscheZahl: i guess he wants a few PHP bots
 AntiSquid: i guess it depends on the coaster, that one looks quite mild MSmits
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/-EFbBMlzHyU?t=17">https://youtu.be/-EFbBMlzHyU?t=17</a>
 MSmits: he can just solve space maze and see other people's solutions
 eulerscheZahl: 3x C#, 1x Python
 eulerscheZahl: no PHP
 MSmits: AntiSquid yeah its pretty old too
 RoboStac: there is a go solution too
 eulerscheZahl: you solved it twice?
 RoboStac: no, I've only done go
 MSmits: plenty of other puzzles that require real searches arent there?
 MSmits: or at least a few?
 eulerscheZahl: my bad. no python
 RoboStac: optimising that was bad enough, no idea if python is even possible
 eulerscheZahl: agreed. was a struggle with C#
 MSmits: i think that is what you can learn from other people's code mostly, how to structure it and how to code the searches. Most other stuff is specific to each multi and for that, a post mortem thread is enough
 dbdr: OK, I wrote a new bot, let's see what it does&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: too bad there was no proper review on the puzzle
 MattSOrme: dbdr, how new? scratch or just some fixes?
 wlesavo: dbdr is it completele new?
 dbdr: mostly scratch
 wlesavo: wow
 wlesavo: nice
 MSmits: dbdr did you test it vs your old version?
 dbdr: started this morning. not sure there's enough time, but let's see
 RoboStac: though I did finally get it to always solve on the first turn and not need to wiggle the car about to get more time
 MSmits: that's funny
 dbdr: I've never ran&#160;:)
 wlesavo: dam robo ruining my hopes, ill still try it, at least to solve some percent of cases
 MSmits: wiggling for more calculation time&#160;:)
 RoboStac: there may well be a decent way wlesavo
 RoboStac: just the way I chose wouldn't work
 eulerscheZahl: illedan solved 1 level offline and hardcoded that validator
 RoboStac: I actually passed all the validators fairly easily, it was test 22 that caused me problems
 RoboStac: so I could have just left it alone
 RoboStac: but it was annoying me
 eulerscheZahl: my respect for solving it. definitely one of the harder puzzles
 wlesavo: it is not always possible to wiggle car around though, right?
 RoboStac: no, but it was on test 22
 RoboStac: I imagine theres nearly always some stable state you can get too
 MSmits: what is the difficulty with this puzzle eulerscheZahl, if you can say without having to write too much
 eulerscheZahl: just a hell lot of states. and hard to tell if you are any closer to the solution with a move
 MSmits: ah I see
 MattSOrme: getting a timeout, but no explanation&#160;:'(
 AntiSquid: MattSOrme you can narrow down the location of the problem code by added debug output lines
 AntiSquid: for me at least it worked easily, since it printed the debug before the timeout section started
 wlesavo: wow, my bot finally have around 50% wr and can climb a little
 RoboStac: yay, #1 (I'll just ignore the fact that it's only due to the people above me resubmitting)
 dbdr: gg wlesavo&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot time?
 AntiSquid: screenshot for PM
 Kukiss: also MattSOrme  you might not see the error information if you print out too much information. At least I noticed it with Python
 MattSOrme: AntiSquad yeah i do that, but this time i don't even know where to start
 wlesavo: thx dbdr, being at the very bottom of legend feels bad :slight_smile:
 MattSOrme: Kukiss I turned off my debug printing, and still timing out
 dbdr: better than top of gold, I would say
 wlesavo: sure
 Kukiss: hard to say the reason then&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: but but but ... there's often bottom legend bots worse than top gold bots!
 MattSOrme: yup. Gonna have to go hunting
 wlesavo: AntiSquid mine probably is
 MattSOrme: Talk about making 1 guy do all the work<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466452052">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466452052</a>
 pb4: "Most other stuff is specific to each multi and for that, a post mortem thread is enough"  --&gt; disagree, I did learn a lot by reading other people's codes
 MattSOrme: OOF. winning by 1 pellet with no moving pacs cos a game hit the 200 round timeout when a pac couldn't find the pellets<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466454167">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466454167</a>
 pb4: though it's better just to ask for that person's code instead of sacrificing a multi...
 eulerscheZahl: or search on github
 pb4: or that too&#160;:)
 pb4: Learned a lot from kimiyuki's hypersonic code
 eulerscheZahl: for the asking part: i guess your success depends on your previous acheivements
 cegprakash: omg RoboStac
 eulerscheZahl: if you would ask me for a bot: sure, here it isif some new guy asks me: probably not
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to be good to get better
 eulerscheZahl: that cow is climbing a lot. saw it around rank 15 this morning. no submit since
 MattSOrme: Seems the way to level up in this game is to let others push you up
 eulerscheZahl: or be really good/lucky
 eulerscheZahl: some users consistently submit into top5
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl why hiding ur best bot
 eulerscheZahl: sadly this is my best
 Yasser: unfortunately, it's not possible to continue this contest due to a bug in codingame for Groovy language.
 eulerscheZahl: so contest is over, we all have to stop now?
 AntiSquid: so it isn't so groovy afterall 
 Cappefra: lol guys
 reCurse: Oh wow chokudai is in the contest. Didn't even notice
 AntiSquid: he entered yesterday
 ZarthaxX: started??
 wlesavo: yes
 AntiSquid: didn't seem like he even needed much time
 ZarthaxX: he got to 14 and startedyesterday?
 AntiSquid: apparently
 wlesavo: exactly
 reCurse: He's another competitive programming legend so not surprising
 ZarthaxX: how the f lol
 AntiSquid: i am surprised he stopped there
 MattSOrme: If you've done loads of these before, probably much easier to get the right framework, or copy old code in

 Cappefra: the most frustrating thing ever is when correcting a bug makes your bot do worse
 Cappefra: wtf
 Chkoupinator: is codingame using C++20 or C++17?

 chokudai: I'm very bad at English so chatting is difficult for me. X(
 AntiSquid: (ReCurse-san, wasn't he really strong as far as I heard the rumor?)
 AntiSquid: recurse-san
 eulerscheZahl: the struggle with English seems to be common among our Japanese competitors, isn't it?
 struct: meanwhile yandex translation (as long as you hear the rumor that Ms. reCurse was not a strong person?)
 reCurse: It's a struggle amongst many Japanese as far as I know
 AntiSquid: he is not on the leaderboard, obv not strong chodukai
 Icebox: they don't need our inferior language
 AntiSquid: "our"
 Icebox: *soviet hymn starts playing*
 reCurse: But they still have much better english than most westerners at japanese
 eulerscheZahl: a friend was in japan once. asked people how to get to a certain place and such. everyone trying to help but he didn't understand a word
 AntiSquid: because it's harder to learn japanaese
 reCurse: Yeah pretty much my experience too
 AntiSquid: and 3 alphabets
 reCurse: Mostly getting by with signs
 eulerscheZahl: except for that one person. he was taking pictures and she got mad for violating personal rights with him taking pictures. the only english speaking person also was the only unfriendly
 lifetimeLearner007: Hey guys, can someone give me suggestions on scoring system? On what basis do I score a state in this game? I'm running monte carlo sim
 AntiSquid: i use google translate with text recognition, worked alright even in china
 lifetimeLearner007: pac count, no.of pellets, pellet points current score, what else?
 cegprakash: may be it's time for me to add pellet probability
 eulerscheZahl: is it a problem for contests like codejam, when you aren't fluent in English?
 cegprakash: I don't know how hard it is though
 cegprakash: yesterday euler was posting some probability image with some pellets having &gt; 1 prob
 eulerscheZahl: fixed that bug
 eulerscheZahl: also the negative probabilities that made me run away from some cells
 Scarfield: pacs needed to give 110% to eat them
 reCurse: There's a difference between getting by and being fluent
 wlesavo: spooky cells
 reCurse: With enough time on google translate I could figure out how to do raic for example
 cegprakash: i just gave some performance boost to my bot I now get 10K sims
 reCurse: It's a pain but it works
 eulerscheZahl: worked surprisingly well on RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: except for the text in images
 reCurse: OCR
 eulerscheZahl: I asked MK to translate me something
 AntiSquid: no
 Scarfield: "fix it" 
 reCurse: But was it worth the price?
 AntiSquid: google translate doesn't fix ambiguity in text
 reCurse: j/k
 eulerscheZahl: he was helpful
 AntiSquid: if you like free t-shirts i guess
 Scarfield: sure, he helped me a lot when i started here and was suggested to do CSB xD he also said fix it a lot, about 50/50
 eulerscheZahl: mini RAIC wasn't even too bad game-wise
 eulerscheZahl: a little annoying that it was only about conquering, not defending
 eulerscheZahl: and 6 players is chaotic
 eulerscheZahl: and they screwed up the finals
 eulerscheZahl: planned to do each vs each with 12 finalists
 eulerscheZahl: that is 12 choose 6 matches to play
 eulerscheZahl: somehow it started as 1 vs 1, they quickly cancelled it
 eulerscheZahl: and then just generated random matchups instead of full round robin
 eulerscheZahl: i got 7th on a coinflip (4-6th got a HDD)
 AntiSquid: Scarfield be honest, MadKnight helping with CSB is more like forced manual labour
 Scarfield: slavory with extra steps :thinking:
 SujalAI: Please help me with bronze league

 AutomatonNN: I have more than that and it doesn't work as it is
 AntiSquid: in JS AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the most problem with the new contest and the code is wrong?
 Scarfield: you dont get input of pacs that arent visible, but you can choose to ignore them or assume where they moved, start with ignoring them  i would advice
 Uljahn: enemy pacs' positions are symmetrical on the first turn
 cegprakash: i found the API
 cegprakash: what do I do now
 AntiSquid: enjoy life
 struct: I think you should focus on contest and figure that after it
 SujalAI: I quit, this sucks
 AntiSquid: so do you
 vtenneke: So ive faced the issue of timing out in battle but not when I send to the IDE. Anyone knows why this is?
 Uljahn: different cpu type?
 Scarfield: any random element to your code? or the opponent has random element, or ^
 cegprakash:&#160;:"(
 Uljahn: my bad, cpu type shouldn't matter if your timing is precise enough
 reCurse: Most bots are not deterministic
 reCurse: So it could be sheer luck
 reCurse: Keep playing in the IDE until you encounter the timeout
 reCurse: Unless you're coding in Rust or C#. Then you're out of luck.
 WINWINWIN: wouldnt a timeout show up irrelevant of how the game proceeds?
 cegprakash: I don't want to see all last battles by hand 
 reCurse: Some could. Some wouldn't.
 reCurse: Can be literally anything
 <b>**SujalAI What is this</b></p><p><img src="/a/22238461634817" /> Scarfield: he propably reached an edge case in his code, when there is a random element to one or both bots, its not certain the reason for the timeout will happen again even from the same seed
 WINWINWIN: Understood, then nothing to do but submit again with a couple of debug messages?
 reCurse: Or keep playing in the IDE until it shows up
 reCurse: But yeah debug helps
 reCurse: Serializing your bot state is even better
 Uljahn: or maybe using the replay reproducer's output could help to recreate the same situation
 reCurse: If his bot is stateless yeah sure
 AntiSquid: compare older version of bot to your newer version, there's a chance it's newly added bug
 reCurse: chance is the keyword here
 reCurse: A lot of my stupidest bugs stuck around since the first version
 AntiSquid: i have some like that too, still not sure why the bot works worse when one gets fixed
 icecream17: all 10 wins. maybe ill finally beat bronze
 reCurse: Because you optimized against that local minima
 reCurse: It's always like that

 <b>**SujalAI slaps eulerscheZahl around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/43832242710795" /> Csipcsirip: you waste too many pacman rouds in the endgame to trap opponent
 icecream17: WHyyy. Everytime I even see myself in the top 100 for one second i lose twice
 eulerscheZahl: more like cluelessly walking around, searching for the last pellets
 eulerscheZahl: trapping randomly happens but i think i would have lost without it as well
 Xlos:  wait how did you get that, where you can see the time you take each turn
 eulerscheZahl: stopwatch or whatever it is in your language
 eulerscheZahl: and then: MOVE id x y message
 Xlos:&#160;? It's displayed on the screen so it wouldn't be a code thing right
 Xlos: I'm talking about in that replay
 eulerscheZahl: you have to output your message along with your move command
 Xlos: There's a command to output a message?!?
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE 0 28 11 |MOVE 1 31 2 |MOVE 2 16 7 |MOVE 3 9 5 |MOVE 4 29 6 34 ms
 eulerscheZahl: the last part prints the time
 Xlos: Whaaa
 eulerscheZahl: you can write a text to each of your pacmen
 Xlos: 10/10
 Xlos: Thanks a lot for that tip
 Xlos: In exchange I will give you the big brain observation I just came up with
 eulerscheZahl: you make me curious
 Xlos: Always use speed at (odd, odd) coordinates
 Xlos: It seems that 3/4 way intersections only occur there
 eulerscheZahl: so i won't waste turns at dead ends
 Xlos: Thus you don't run into vision problems
 Xlos: That too
 Scarfield: hmm... big brain 
 icecream17: 60th!
 eulerscheZahl: hm, let me try that offline vs my arena bot
 Xlos: This is the power of thinking on the toilet
 kovi: depends on your overall strat
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://nedroid.com/2018/05/driven-to-greatness/">http://nedroid.com/2018/05/driven-to-greatness/</a>
 Cappefra: i was expecting something stupid tbh and then you come with this actual game-changing observation
 kovi: if you trapper, this will be counterproductive
 kovi: (been there...)
 eulerscheZahl: i planned to limit my speed use a bit
 eulerscheZahl: right now i only allow speed at the first step of my sim, not any deeper
 eulerscheZahl: so i might speed while there's 1 pellet and then a dead end
 eulerscheZahl: so changing that is on my list anyways
 eulerscheZahl: so far arena: 19   Pacman: 17   draw: 4
 eulerscheZahl: a little worse but in range of randomness
 kovi: unlike parity, that specific case didnt worked for me for some reason
 Xlos: Hmm
 Chkoupinator: anyone knows which file in the github gives the output every turn&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: start with Referee.java and track it from there
 Chkoupinator: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: SPEED at odd coords seems to be on par with always speeding
 Cappefra: I would really like to figure out how to make that cgbenchmark work
 eulerscheZahl: at least for my bot
 wlesavo: for mine also seems not to make it worse
 wlesavo: submitting it rn
 eulerscheZahl: always allowing it in first and 2nd turn in my sim: arena: 22   Pacman: 11   draw: 4
 eulerscheZahl: that's getting worse, hmm
 icecream17: aww im not in top 1000 so cgstats doesnt work
 eulerscheZahl: and the cow got pushed to #1 now :D
 eulerscheZahl: feels so random
 ChooJeremy: I think the observation shouldn't be speed at (odd, odd)
 kovi: it is weirdest ever
 ChooJeremy: because there are dead ends at (odd, odd) too
 Xlos: Interesting, thanks for testing
 eulerscheZahl: worse than locam
 ChooJeremy: something like (1) prefer speed at intersections
 ChooJeremy: and (2) Observation: intersections always appear at (odd, odd) for some reason (how to abuse?)
 Xlos: I thought it would be much better since you get vision at every intersection
 Xlos: Maybe it's too conditional
 eulerscheZahl: but sounds reasonable
 ChooJeremy: yeah but probably better to test for intersections (x+1, y), (x-1, y) (x, y+1), (x, y-1) rather than just odd, odd
 ChooJeremy: you're given the grid at the start
 eulerscheZahl: speed at odd is fine. will make you end up on an intersection later
 Scarfield: the idea seems good, but a search should find out by itself i think&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: my search won't, pruning options
 icecream17: Oh. When I speed i stay in the same position and think i collided
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: "stop hitting yourself"
 reCurse: Worse than locam? Such exaggeration
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, i take that back
 eulerscheZahl: pacman is still enjoyable to play for me
 eulerscheZahl: locam was a pain
 kovi: we were only talk about leaderboard randomness
 reCurse: Even then
 reCurse: locam was much more tight and random
 eulerscheZahl: locam had a clear #1 (closet) and #2 (recurse)
 kovi: in locam there was a clear top3
 kovi: well yeah
 kovi: royale in top5
 eulerscheZahl: the cow submitted 12h ago, ranked around 15th
 eulerscheZahl: now at #1
 eulerscheZahl: pushed up all the way
 reCurse: locam: 2.8pt in top30
 kovi: i also made a top1 than a top10 pushed up top3 today
 reCurse: pac: 5pt in top30
 reCurse: I rest my case
 kovi: that is the point, even 5 pt means nothing with 50-50%
 eulerscheZahl: but a drifting of 3 points
 reCurse: You think there was no such drifting during locam?&#160;:)
 RoboStac: cow's cg stats are interesting
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i wasn't really dedicated at locam
 kovi: pointwise less, rankwise similar except top
 kovi: top3
 eulerscheZahl: so i can't tell how much locam was drifting
 RoboStac: 50%+ against top few, less than 50% against those lower
 eulerscheZahl: yeah. and as higher ranked players keep submitting...
 CowZow: Hello! I was also surprised to find myself this high up...
 eulerscheZahl: and for the final rerun you only play against close neighbors on the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: we were too. congrats anyways&#160;:)
 kovi: i fell 5-&gt;19
 CowZow: ha, i don't think it will last. How did you find the stats vs other bots?
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/CowZow">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2020/CowZow</a>
 cegprakash: is 42 a nice seed for srand? I feel like  changing seed can help
 cegprakash: ppl started countering my seed
 eulerscheZahl: do you believe in horoscopes too?
 CowZow: ah interesting
 kovi: yeah, not everything is 50-50
 reCurse: This rerun will be a rollercoaster
 kovi: i really dont know what to expect
 reCurse: A rollercoaster
 eulerscheZahl: and psyh o will disappear for another 4 years
 kovi: even though i still bet on him, i even wonder how karliso will handle this randomness
 kovi: phew it was a hard climb to 10th
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know if psyh o is really trying or just playing a bit for fun
 Miarem: reCurse, because of your inactivity. codingGame thinks that Ubisoft is Ukrainian company&#160;: )
 reCurse: It partly is
 Cappefra: I think that's it for me
 Cappefra: 140 gold is the best I can do apparently
 eulerscheZahl: you will drop if you stop now
 EvModder: enum MoveType {COLLECT, SPEED, CHASE, RUN, HIDE, ACCEPT_DEATH};
 EvModder: the last one is my favorite of course
 Miarem: i'm curious how the country of the company is defined
 Miarem: most of them are global...
 Cappefra: I'm out of ideas, literally any change I've made in the past 30 hours has made it worse and I eventually had to revert it
 reCurse: Well isn't that the fun of globalization
 reCurse: It's defined by whatever is most profitable for a specific case
 eulerscheZahl: for tax reasons the headquarter shall be in Ireland now
 AntiSquid: my rank fluctuates from 110 to 150 so hard to say anything about the final rank :D
 reCurse: You will be below 100.
 AntiSquid: Cappefra not sure it's worth trying harder anymore
 AntiSquid: i am below 200 overall ...
 AntiSquid: i mean not top 200 
 eulerscheZahl: 99 in legend already
 cegprakash: what was ur best versions' rank AntiSquid
 reCurse: Well you said hard to say anything
 reCurse: I found it easy to say something&#160;:)
 Chkoupinator: enemy pacs always spawn symmetrically to our pacs right?
 AntiSquid: idk what my best version is cegprakash
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Chkoupinator: thanc
 cegprakash: my #40 bot few mins back is getting so badly rekt now
 Miarem: there are so many participants... it won't affect much the final points 
 Chkoupinator: am I the only one to find the information summary lacking?
 Scarfield: both positions and types Chkoupinator
 cegprakash: donno what everyone added or everyone is stuck on bottom legend like me
 AntiSquid: it does affect the final points a lot when mid gold orso Miarem
 Chkoupinator: Scarfield thanks :D
 AntiSquid: huge difference from top 50 to top 200 or even just top 100
 Miarem: for 5k participants?
 cegprakash: hey AntiSquid yes
 wlesavo: that big brain thingy seems to work for my bot at least
 AntiSquid: yes Miarem
 EvModder: idk, i was 14 yesterday and now i'm 50ish, so i think there's a fair bit of flectuation
 cegprakash: top 100 in gold probably already has dead player tracking
 AntiSquid: 2k points diff, but w/e&#160;:/
 cegprakash: what is gold  boss' point now
 EvModder: dead player tracking?
 AntiSquid: or 3-4k&#160;?
 Zenoscave: My enemy prediction does awful
 Zenoscave: Does attacking enemies work? I just avoid enemies if at all possible
 eulerscheZahl: of course you can attack
 eulerscheZahl: game i'm debugging right now: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466454277">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466454277</a>
 Zenoscave: I mean is it worthwhile?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 kills and still lost :D
 eulerscheZahl: but kills were all in endgame
 eulerscheZahl: and 2 of them were really nice
 ChooJeremy: If the enemy is smart and your attacking is just chasing the enemy without any guarantees of reaching it the enemy can just keep running and you'll never reach him
 eulerscheZahl: in the replay i shared you can see 3 guaranteed kills
 Zenoscave: So only go for traps then
 ChooJeremy: yup I know, was responding to Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: still costs a few turns that you miss on harvesting
 Zenoscave: Ok so scoring tuning for it is a good hope maybe
 cegprakash: i'm changing my seed to a prime number 
 cegprakash: lets see if it works
 Doju: Oh great, i'm controlling dead pacs again somehow
 eulerscheZahl: switch them to rock first
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl why Rock?
 Zenoscave: that is completely arbitrary
 Zenoscave: Like a prime seed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJQPYKvU6U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJQPYKvU6U</a>
 Zenoscave: lol
 Tiberiu02: Will the leaderboard freeze exactly when the contest is over, or will it keep evaluating for a while to reach a stable state?
 eulerscheZahl: finish pending submits
 eulerscheZahl: including league promotions
 eulerscheZahl: then a big rerun for top100
 eulerscheZahl: everyone gets about 1000 matches
 eulerscheZahl: takes a few hours to finish
 eulerscheZahl: then the ranking is final
 kovi: will it be 1000 only?
 eulerscheZahl: every player starts 500 matches
 kovi: considering the randomness more would be welcome
 Thiesjoo: Wut Clyde can timeout? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466585244">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466585244</a>
 eulerscheZahl: at the same time you can be chosen as opponent with equal probability
 Numby: Can we keep submitting for fun after the competition is over or we have to wait for a while?
 Tiberiu02: Wow nice to know
 eulerscheZahl: i think the #1 player will even get less matches statistically, #6 will get more than 1000
 eulerscheZahl: as opponent selection is in range +-5
 eulerscheZahl: and there is no #-4 player fighting #1
 eulerscheZahl: while #1 only has 5 opponents (2-6), giving more games to #6
 Tiberiu02: Are these details written anywhere?
 eulerscheZahl: there's an old forum post. but not much detail
 eulerscheZahl: it's always like this for a few years
 eulerscheZahl: with a 4 player game you get more battles (as you always start 500 yourself and get chosen as an opponent by others)
 eulerscheZahl: can't find the forum post anymore
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't say more than I just did now
 eulerscheZahl: and pb4 might do his alternative ranking again
 eulerscheZahl: which of course has no effect on prize awards

 eulerscheZahl: let's ignore that you suicide right into the opponent for a moment
 eulerscheZahl: your scissors completely ignores the superpellets
 SujalAI: I am just going towards the closest pellet
 eulerscheZahl: your rocks moves straight into the corner. that mean it has to go back and can't collect anything on that way
 SujalAI: And they switch when an enemy is close
 Doju: Oh
 eulerscheZahl: you don't use speed
 SujalAI: i've not
 wlesavo: euler wow i completly missed that pbs alternative ranking, htx
 Doju: i was weighting stuff in the inverse way that i should've been. Maybe that's the reason why my bot sucked
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't miss it - I provided the data :P
 AntiSquid: refactoring magically fixing a bug i wasn't aware of @_@
 eulerscheZahl: for such an analysis you don't even have to download every single match. it's enough to load the last battles list
 kovi: it depends on lucky roll + who is submitting
 kovi: back to top5 again
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you kicked me out
 eulerscheZahl: that will be a fun rerun tomorrow
 ashikujjaman: how can I play my bot with boss multiple time 
 .epsilon.: I got the clyde bot to time out...
 AntiSquid: i got the gold bot to time out at least once
 SujalAI: How can I detect where the superpellets are?
 AntiSquid: seems like if it can't track you properly then it times out :D
 Braykin08: SujalAI when you read the pellet input, you know it's value. A superpellet is worth 10
 ShannonNorris97: SujalAI, if you're looking through all pellets you can pick out the super ones because they have a value of 10 instead of 1
 SujalAI: Oh yeah i forgot we can see super pellets from anywhere
 IAmNoob: I make a distance function which selects the pallet where to go
 IAmNoob: depending of the value
 fchris82: Why I can't go to higher leagues? I submitted my code, my pacmans win, but nothing happend. Just the same leagues.
 IAmNoob: you have to defeat the boss
 SamuelTheBad: you have to be ranked higher than the boss AI for that league
 fchris82: My rank is 1. If I see the last battles tab, Ranking order:1. Me2. Pinky
 RoboStac: you have to wait for 100% battles to be complete too
 RoboStac: on last battles it'll show your progress
 Doju: Oh noooow we're talking
 fchris82: AAaa, I can see. Battles in progress 86%
 Doju: i was calculating a value for each cell but not actually including it in the final value
 Doju: it's actually finally doing what it's supposed to be doing
 Doju: leaving pellets at dead ends every now and then etc.
 Doju: Flying up the ladder!
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 AntiSquid: haha same issue here
 AntiSquid: fixed a serious bug then decided it's clever to submit, now struggling
 AntiSquid: we need to do our own tweets about our contest progression
 Zenoscave: And I can't test improvements in this state
 AntiSquid: nobody can
 AntiSquid: it's more like lottery at this point what final rank i get
 cegprakash: FrenchKiss is hiding his bot
 AntiSquid: lol
 Zenoscave: what league Ceg?
 cegprakash: legend league.. he has submitted some dummy code and stays at #100
 lifetimeLearner007: can u do &lt;50 rank, cegprakash?
 ChooJeremy: Doju
 cegprakash: lifetimeLearner007 no but I can do &lt; 20
 lifetimeLearner007: oooooohhh.. nice
 IAmNoob: If i exit the tab and in the last few seconds i submited it is there a problem/will it stop?
 cegprakash: already been top  top 30-40 many times.. so real target for me is top 20
 cegprakash: and then spam [CG]Thibaud for sending me my first T shirt
 AntiSquid: you didn't get tshirt yet @_@
 AntiSquid: ceg you need to try harder
 lifetimeLearner007: this time there are no t-shirts i think
 lifetimeLearner007: or am I wrong? lemme check
 IAmNoob: Is there not a way to speed up the subtim?
 AntiSquid: ah right no t-shirts this time cegprakash it seems
 lifetimeLearner007: yep, no t-shirts
 IAmNoob: Who knows
 cegprakash: but if I get to top 20 they will give me
 cegprakash: I'll have to believe on that
 cegprakash: don't change my mind
 AntiSquid: that's why i am not top 20 yet /s
 lifetimeLearner007: yes... cool t-shirts are there cegparkash but for top 15. So get under 15 rank... (Y)
 lifetimeLearner007: :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: where does it say?
 lifetimeLearner007: :p
 AntiSquid: didn't see any
 IAmNoob: How old is CODE OF KUTULU?

 Counterbalance: oct 2018
 IAmNoob: and i like it
 IAmNoob: it is really nice
 NickStahl: found a bug in my code, I bet when I fix it it will result in so many new bugs that I rather keep this one&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: kutulu was less random than this mess
 IAmNoob: yes
 lifetimeLearner007: haha.. yeah NickStahl. tell me about it

 cegprakash: looks like a good submit
 cegprakash: :D
 eulerscheZahl: even a few contest winners are missing
 cegprakash: 12 in 15
 NinjaDoggy: true!
 cegprakash: go go #1
 Inaniwa: I won all the first 10 races. But I still can't seem to be promoted
 AntiSquid: cegprakash
 NinjaDoggy: like closet AI saying F it after winning hearthstone
 lifetimeLearner007: looking good prakash

 NinjaDoggy: karliso rank 1 in a lot of multis...
 IAmNoob: trash kids
 dbf: I copy paste my bot from ide to cg websitefor every submit
 IAmNoob: ok not that
 IAmNoob: i mean from githib or youtube
 IAmNoob: or other ways
 lifetimeLearner007: u can use CGSync extension, dbf
 SujalAI: I want to amke a 2d array of all the pellets in the grid how do i do that?
 lifetimeLearner007: have to rewrite from youtube, not copy paste right
 SujalAI: The logic is that everything other than a wall is a pellet
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: try a boolean matrix
 IAmNoob: or a struct with x, y
 IAmNoob: a queue pair
 IAmNoob: there are many ways
 lifetimeLearner007: u've to manually create 2d array structure in JS, SujalAI. JS doesn't have inbuilt support for multidimentional arrays
 SujalAI: I don't know what mistake I'm doing, but I'm getting an empty array
 SujalAI: I know lifetimelearner
 IAmNoob: you dont have to update every frame
 SujalAI: This is my code
 IAmNoob: you know right?

 IAmNoob: you know right?
 SujalAI: I didn't make a 2d array
 SujalAI: I just made an array with all the pellet objects
 IAmNoob: ok...
 SujalAI: I don't know what's wrong with it but it's making an empty array

 IAmNoob: sometimes that is how life work
 lifetimeLearner007: cz JS is very friendly

 IAmNoob: I like how simple JS is
 IAmNoob: compared to c++ or python
 IAmNoob: or java
 IAmNoob: JS is more friendly
 SujalAI: Python is almost useless without any modules
 IAmNoob: i use sys
 IAmNoob: but my main is c++
 IAmNoob: i would like to try to learn C#
 Kukiss: but you can import basic modules here for Python, like numpy
 SujalAI: My pac and the enemy are going for the same pellet so they are stuck in a loop
 IAmNoob: i know
 SujalAI: How can i fix this?
 IAmNoob: this is the main challenge:))
 Cence: You ceck if your position is still the last position
 Cence: *check
 IAmNoob: try to check if the positions repeat
 IAmNoob: and if so....
 SujalAI: But I think it's okay if I ignore it because we both lose one pac
 IAmNoob: try a random position
 IAmNoob: SujalAI league?
 SujalAI: bronze
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: when you are gona evolve you gona see many bots that dont stuck
 IAmNoob: i am bronze:((
 IAmNoob: but i know 
 SujalAI: I made an improvement to my code and I rank became worse
 SujalAI: I ahte it when that happens
 AntiSquid: don't worry that happenes to everyone in this contest
 IAmNoob: it is 50% random SujalAI soooo...
 SujalAI: How do I remove a specific element from an array in JS
 Counterbalance: splice
 AntiSquid: use the power of google
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)))0
 SujalAI: My rank became much worse after the improvement
 IAmNoob: this is the first rule
 IAmNoob: If your code works dont toucjh it
 IAmNoob: touch*
 TidyMaze: hi, there is a quick chart to track score evolution in time (top 20). F5 for new data<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRdR4SpYZ-t8o11tqqMpMQruRPaMjRChAhyJAcWd38W41uExbPFK_I-TKpXjKll3-f6JkUod14jffDY/pubchart?oid=1159856779&amp;format=interactive">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRdR4SpYZ-t8o11tqqMpMQruRPaMjRChAhyJAcWd38W41uExbPFK_I-TKpXjKll3-f6JkUod14jffDY/pubchart?oid=1159856779&amp;format=interactive</a>
 SujalAI: The array thing doesn't work for some reason
 AntiSquid: what array thing&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: does any1 have a replay with a corridor kill possibility at the start of the game&#160;?

 Csipcsirip: &lt;3
 SujalAI: I made a function to remove elements from an array
 SujalAI: function remove(arr, ele){
 SujalAI: function remove(arr, ele){
 SujalAI: It works fine for arrays with numbers and strings
 Counterbalance: val&#160;!= ele might not work for {}
 SujalAI: But I have an array with Pellet objects and it doesn't work on that
 cegprakash: #40 and 12 hours ticking..
 cegprakash: I just need 40 more iffs
 cegprakash: to reach #1
 Counterbalance: how do you get ele? do you know the index in the array? If so, just do arr.splice(index, 1)
 SujalAI: I made an array which takes everything other than a wall as a pellet, now I need to remove the pellet objects which are in the place of a pac
 SujalAI: because a pellet is gone when a pac is in its location
 SujalAI: I don't know the index
 cegprakash: don't delete an element from array it's costly.. have a flag array saying removed[5] and mark it true
 SujalAI: what's a flag array
 cegprakash: boolean array
 cegprakash: if u want to delete index 2
 SujalAI: okay
 cegprakash: store erased[2] = true
 Aplet123: doing that is stupid, then indexing is broken
 Counterbalance: can do  (val) =&gt; val.x&#160;!= ele.x &amp;&amp; val.y&#160;!= ele.y to get that filter to work
 SujalAI: Okay I will try that
 cegprakash: exactly Aplet123
 MadKnight: hey cegprakash how's your bot&#160;?
 MadKnight: already legend&#160;?
 cegprakash: ofc MadKnight
 cegprakash: ezpz
 cegprakash: but I'm stuck around #40-#60 
 cegprakash: there is some serious prediction going on in that range
 cegprakash: so I'm adding my own prediction
 cegprakash: slowly but surely
 Counterbalance: not too slow, the timer will start blinking in 34 minutes
 cegprakash: ot
 cegprakash: it's time for eulerscheZahl #1
 cegprakash: look at him go
 MadKnight: cegprakash when is time for cegprakash #1&#160;?
 cegprakash: A day may come
 cegprakash: when I don't want to become #1
 cegprakash: But it is not this day
 MadKnight: today is the last day ceggy
 MadKnight: gogogogo
 eulerscheZahl: when you apply an unreasonable filter like country only, i am first. that's how aCat and his team got first at OoC
 MSmits: I am first too then
 Counterbalance: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 MSmits: sorry :P
 cegprakash: cheer for me MadKnight
 Counterbalance: :D
 cegprakash: it counts
 Braykin08: C'mon, country is absolutely reasonable
 MSmits: I'm done though
 SujalAI: I don't understand why the includes function is not not working. This is my code
 SujalAI: [new Pellet(3,1,1)].includes(new Pellet(3,1,1))
 SujalAI: And its showing false
 MSmits: I didnt finish my todo list, but the changes would be marginal and I dont want to risk completely messing up my rank to start at recalc
 SujalAI: Even though I just made an array with that exact element
 MadKnight: because it doesn't include itself SujalAI
 eulerscheZahl: i have a few TODOs too. but no biggies
 MSmits: I never made a kill function
 MSmits: I did write an avoidance function for dead ends
 eulerscheZahl: except for my screwed up opening, going to the wrong super pellets on some maps
 MSmits: but i dont think it works very well
 TidyMaze: SujalAI javascript is a stupid language with no defined equals function. You cannot do oneObject == anotherObject
 SujalAI: MadKnight I checked in an array with a pellet object for a pellet object
 TidyMaze: includes uses the == operator
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even try to avoid kills in dead ends
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i thought that was common?
 cegprakash: TidyMaze very true u can't even sort an array of integers
 MSmits: i mean if you kill there, why not avoid there?
 eulerscheZahl: dunno, didn't feel like coding it
 MSmits: i know that feeling, lost motivation for a few days now :P
 eulerscheZahl: i guess that attitude is part of the reason why i will never win :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the lack of talent
 MSmits: well I've found in the last few contest that I've adopted your way of looking at it
 MSmits: i can't be arsed, screw it
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: i blame community games
 MSmits: i enjoy them so much that whenever I spend a week on a contest like this, I miss them
 eulerscheZahl: you truly like boardgames
 MSmits: your Onitama was awesome
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: but now you are done i guess
 eulerscheZahl: you have a good bot, the rest turns into randomness
 MSmits: yeah i am I refitted the constants a while ago
 MSmits: I think it's 60% vs karlis o and tric trac
 MSmits: so its pretty clear
 eulerscheZahl: and then they fit their constants again, beating youand so on
 eulerscheZahl: time to stop that cycle if you don't have ideas for real improvements
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: I am on breakthrough now
 MSmits: seems really easy to code a sim for it
 MSmits: but the strategy is hard
 eulerscheZahl: an interesting game
 struct: MSmits any board game you would like to see that isnt here yet?
 MSmits: you know what people will answer to that
 eulerscheZahl: i try to plit the board into regions that i minimax independently
 MSmits: they've been dogging you for months
 eulerscheZahl: if i attack here, i win in 4 moves
 eulerscheZahl: opponent takes 6, so attack
 MSmits: thats the idea i think eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: i think you need to take a pawn and then only consider the stuff diagonally ahead of it
 MSmits: the other pawns cant reach it
 MSmits: so you can min max that area
 dbf: oh, looks like I need to setup clock for 5am tomorrow to test couple of fixes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: or a group of pawns
 dbf: submits are so slow
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: your attacker team
 MSmits: maybe so. I think I will need a look up array to look up patterns and eval them
 eulerscheZahl: everyone playing now. it will end soon
 eulerscheZahl: 33 computing in legend alone
 eulerscheZahl: 214 in total
 SujalAI: Can you tell me what mistake I'm doing here:
 SujalAI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466711042">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466711042</a>
 MSmits: you're not moving
 dbf: where is aws auto-scaling when we need it?
 eulerscheZahl: ignoring big pellet at 15,12
 TidyMaze: SujalAI turn 17, you bump several times your own pacs
 MSmits: thats how they say hello
 MSmits: social distancing 
 cegprakash: SujalAI turn 17 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and then moving both units in a line, not spreading and harvesting
 SujalAI: I'm just in bronze
 eulerscheZahl: and still no SPEED as i told you earlier
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl does it seem like there are more top players than usual? You know many from other platforms right?
 cegprakash: SujalAI first turn u are not moving all ur pacs
 MSmits: and older contests 
 MSmits: I'm just wondering if besides having more players we also have more top players
 eulerscheZahl: there are some from topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know all of them, i'm that not active there
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: topcoders: psyh o, ieh h, davier 19, sullype r
 eulerscheZahl: all capable of beating me on their platform
 MSmits: speed is more of an issue there right?
 eulerscheZahl: fast coding?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: like a few hrs
 eulerscheZahl: no, these are marathon matches too. 1 week for an optim problem
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder has short rounds as well. but i ignore them
 MSmits: you know, if this was a short contest, I would actually have gotten a better rank. First time that happened
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tinyurl.com/y9mqv25y">https://tinyurl.com/y9mqv25y</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so we won't see you rise this night?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: it's done
 MSmits: well I wont submit anything new that is
 MSmits: dunno what other people will do
 eulerscheZahl: i hereby claim victory over MSmits
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 MSmits: well deserved too
 MSmits: too often I beat you by 2 ranks :P
 eulerscheZahl: kind of got a habit :D
 MSmits: hehe yea. Maybe next time&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm hoping no more hidden information though
 dbdr: lol, numbers of subs in top 15
 dbdr: almost everyone
 eulerscheZahl: 7
 eulerscheZahl: 8
 Illedan: Hi, zup?
 MSmits: hi 
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl so back to #1 global now&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 12h to gothen it's finally over
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, your estimated probability of finally getting that top 3 achievement?&#160;;)
 MSmits: WINWINWIN he's been trading places with royale for a while now
 eulerscheZahl: 2%
 MSmits: it's entertaining
 ashelkov: luck to everyone!
 dbdr: that's low
 WINWINWIN: :D looks like it will take a considerable lead now, huge lead in contest and when it comes as a multi, that too
 eulerscheZahl: i have to improve for top3 for sure
 MSmits: people find it hard to optimize vs you eulerscheZahl
 ashelkov: its pretty hard to validate ideas beacuse of long submit and random factor
 MSmits: because you crash their IDE games
 eulerscheZahl: not even on purpose&#160;:(
 kovi: euler - who do you think currently top3?
 struct: I wonder if this is going to get fixed
 eulerscheZahl: the randomness is a pain
 MSmits: you're just straining C#
 struct: I know you dont abuse it but still
 MSmits: to the max
 eulerscheZahl: there are at least 10 candidates for top3
 kovi: ok
 eulerscheZahl: and we don't know who's hiding
 dbdr: is there such a strong meta? I would think most of the time you can improve in general
 dbdr: not against a specific player
 dbdr: but I have not been really paying attention to that
 kovi: probably some metas in (aggression)
 MSmits: one time I did a submit that got 8% winrate out of 100 vs kovi and 50% vs euler (40% if you discount the crashes)
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: i did a test i mean
 MSmits: cg bench
 MSmits: then i changed a constant and it was 47% vs kovi
 MSmits: so yea... meta
 MSmits: i just cant explain what causes the difference exactly. It's hidden meta
 kovi: what was that constant lol?
 kovi: priv
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio you are making me nervous lol
 MSmits: had to do with how I handled opponent prediction
 kovi: (ofcourse)
 eulerscheZahl: games parsed: 215     timeouts found: 0
 MSmits: dont know the details
 eulerscheZahl: take that!
 MSmits: gj&#160;:)
 kovi: that is meta independent improvement
 MSmits: no i was doing a probability thing where I floodfilled out from opponents with their speed per turn, making many assumptions
 MSmits: some of them might conflict with your bot behavior
 kovi: i meant eulers no timeout improvement
 MSmits: when i set the constant to 0, my bot was back to normal winrate vs you
 Nerchio: ZarthaxX i just spam submit i dont code for like the past 5 days
 Nerchio: i fixed only some variables
 ZarthaxX: oh..
 ZarthaxX: but man, wtf you were there
 ZarthaxX: painful to watch
 Nerchio: yeah close
 ZarthaxX: wait a sec for that dude submitting
 Nerchio: lost too many now
 ZarthaxX: maybe he pushes u
 MSmits: how close Nerchio?
 ZarthaxX: D:
 Nerchio: i feel from 1st twice i think
 Nerchio: fell
 MSmits: wow damn
 MSmits: if you end very near the boss, keep it there if many are submitting
 Nerchio: i dont like this challenge though i can end on 300th and on 1st
 MSmits: maybe someone submits who pushes you
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio for real same submit in gold has that behaviour?
 NinjaDoggy: lol "i can end on 300th and on 1st" true
 Nerchio: yea
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 Nerchio: gold is sad
 MSmits: it's like that in legend also, though its a smaller league
 MSmits: so smaller spread
 MSmits: I am 20-60
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i always try to be above the boss when a new league opens
 Nerchio: maybe not 300 but 150+ easily
 NinjaDoggy: I miss perfect information games&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: less meta based&#160;:(
 MSmits: same NinjaDoggy
 eulerscheZahl: no submitting at 5:55pm
 ZarthaxX: those weredays
 NinjaDoggy: COIF was so sick
 MSmits: but do arena's after the contest, most of them are perfect information
 eulerscheZahl: COIF was great
 MSmits: COIF was great, wish i had had a little more time fo rit
 Nerchio: i have a positive win ratio vs the boss but still i mean too much luck
 MSmits: Nerchio
 MSmits: stay up all night
 MSmits: keep submitting
 MSmits: you will pull him down
 eulerscheZahl: wait a bit
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466727600">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466727600</a>
 MSmits: with less people submitting, your 50% + will win out
 eulerscheZahl: 0.6 below the boss
 Nerchio: would be nice to go legend but i dont care that much if i dont get it
 eulerscheZahl: you have to get up there and fight the boss
 MSmits: what is your exact winrate vs boss Nerchio?
 wlesavo: i promouted from #7, with that many people submiting you will be in legend in no time
 Nerchio: it was 33% before i fixed variables :D
 dbdr: Nerchio that is NOT the spirit&#160;;)
 MSmits: and now?
 Nerchio: now its 55% or something i think
 Nerchio: i tested 180games
 MSmits: mmh to trust 55%, you have to test with like 200 games
 Nerchio: yeah close
 MSmits: ah... not very certain, but within lucky submit range
 MSmits: the thing is, if noone else submits, you will promote everyone your bot is weak against and only keep the players your bot is strong against, and you will pull down the boss
 Nerchio: long term maybe yes but last time submitters pulled me down :D
 MSmits: other people submitting will mess this process up
 eulerscheZahl: but when the next submit finishes around 100, it doesn't matter
 MSmits: this is why you dont go to sleep
 MSmits: pro-tip
 Nerchio: lol :P
 eulerscheZahl: or script the submitting
 cfenoy: anyone having random timeout while reading the input?
 eulerscheZahl: python?
 cfenoy: yes
 MSmits: you need to let your bot read it, human reading is too slow
 Nerchio: euler I feel like if more people used the scripts and apps that top players use this site would explode :p
 eulerscheZahl: flush your error stream
 MSmits: 50 ms
 cfenoy: ok, I'll try that, thanks
 <b>**MSmits trollmode off</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> Thiesjoo: MSmits no sleeping? How does that work?
 Cappefra: Nerchio already tried submit spamming?
 MSmits: well, you stay up all night and keep submitting until legend
 eulerscheZahl: Nerchio that's why noone has shared the timeout checker
 MSmits: not me though, I am done. 
 MSmits: need to teach you tomorrow Thiesjoo
 eulerscheZahl: you have to download each match individually
 Cappefra: feels bad seeing you #2 the whole day
 MSmits: dont want to be zombie
 Thiesjoo: Zombies are cool too&#160;:)
 NapTown: so who's going to win this thing
 MSmits: true true
 eulerscheZahl: i still feel bad for the OoC stats I made. downloading 5GB of replays
 MSmits: brb
 ZarthaxX: so cool looking at teacher-student chat here lol
 Cappefra: any idea why cgbenchmark would add this characters at the beginning of my program? √Ø¬ª¬ø
 Cappefra: of course every game fails like that
 cfenoy: even with flushing stderr it still times out. I can see a debug message before reading the pellets, but not after
 eulerscheZahl: encoding
 Nerchio: AI coomunicates with you
 Cappefra: lol
 eulerscheZahl: try to save it with a different encoding
 eulerscheZahl: UTF8 if Neumann is a reasonable person
 Cappefra: I'd have oped VS Code already saves it like that
 Cappefra: let me see
 MSmits: ZarthaxX yeah I like that Thiesjoo joined.
 MSmits: first time i see one of my students in a contest
 Thiesjoo: Im trying my best, currently rank 600 in silver
 eulerscheZahl: Nerchio submitted again. and failed the first few matches
 AntiSquid: submits got slower?
 Thiesjoo: Goal was top 1000 overall, but looks like im not going to make that
 Nerchio: yea and i submit again and again :D
 Neumann: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/svivien/cgbenchmark/CGBenchmark.java#L94">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/svivien/cgbenchmark/CGBenchmark.java#L94</a>
 MSmits: yeah it's better than anyone else from your class would manage though, so well done. 
 AntiSquid: it's very random
 AntiSquid: extremely random
 dbf: MSmits, if your student beats you in a contest will it count for an exam?
 Neumann: I suppose it's UTF8 by default .. not sure
 Nerchio: 500 people gold with pacman randomness is too much
 AntiSquid: like AutomatonNN's underwear are falling off kind of random
 AutomatonNN: yeah
 Nerchio: i need to win first 12+ matches to shoot up to top80
 AntiSquid: see?
 MSmits: dbf unfortunately I teach him two subjects but neither of them are computer science&#160;:)
 MSmits: physics and a subject similar to physics
 MSmits: my colleague teaches him CS
 Thiesjoo: NLT is pretty fun tho
 AntiSquid: ya submit spam is the only way
 Cappefra: yeah VS Code does utf8 by default
 Thiesjoo: Nature, life and technology
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: mandatory loss streak incoming&#160;?
 Neumann: Cappefra: what's happening&#160;?
 MSmits: i guess dynamic modelling is a bit CS-like
 AntiSquid: nerchio i saw you at top 5 i think, what happened?
 Nerchio: unlucky last matches :P
 Neumann: Nerchio&#160;: what are you up to these days&#160;? Working in IT&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and how much did you get dropped?
 Nerchio: im finishing studies as my profile suggests
 Nerchio: what do you mean antisquid
 AntiSquid: Neumann still thinks it's that starcraft player?
 Nerchio: i think spam submit is a better way to advance rather than waiting for 1 point difference
 Neumann: I though you already graduated. Studying what field&#160;?
 AntiSquid: from top 5 how much did you drop before you submitted ... you lose rank / drop in rank when you lose, that's what i meant
 MSmits: is that one of Thrall's spirit wolves Nerchio
 Nerchio: distributed systems
 Nerchio: idk its a wolf :D
 MSmits: it's a spirit wolf
 Neumann: Nice
 Nerchio: yes
 AntiSquid: it's a pooch MSmits, can't recognize it?
 Nerchio: antisquid i resubmit at  top3 :P
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't have done that
 AntiSquid: streak of bad luck here
 AntiSquid: this is a rank 400+  bot and look at it now, it's top 100 for now at least, but still weird
 MSmits: hey, how long have you had that avatar AntiSquid
 MSmits: I've used that picture in power point presentations
 AntiSquid: maybe if i slide that one magic variable in my code one more time and do a backflip i get rank 1 legend who knows
 MSmits: to explain how stars are formed
 AntiSquid: it's the pacman nebula
 AntiSquid: so since contest started
 MSmits: pretty sure it's the eagle nebula :P
 AntiSquid: well you're wrong
 MSmits: sure, correct the astrophysicist on names of nebulae
 MSmits: it could have been named the pacman nebula
 AntiSquid: i searched pacman nebula, same picture appeared on 100 different sites so
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: i can agree with 1 person and disagree with everyone else, but what's the point&#160;?
 Bernard_Lowe: if you push code and your code is worse then earlier, you won't lose your league rank right (gold, silver, etc)&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm you might be right, if i look at the bigger version it s abit different
 AntiSquid: MSmits i just searched eagle nebula, it's not that one, maybe you're confused because it's a small picture
 BeeGee: Bernard_Lowe no, you don't lose your league rank
 MSmits: you're right AntiSquid
 MSmits: they are pretty similar
 AntiSquid: also is any of them colored in their true color on the internet?
 MSmits: I thought you were kidding with the pacman nebula and you just went through lots of nebulae until you found one that looks like pacman :p
 AntiSquid: i mean the results show same thing in 30 different colors
 MSmits: most of them arent colored true
 MSmits: much of it is UV light
 MSmits: or infrared
 MSmits: often a combination to see different features
 MSmits: some of these radiation types get through dust very well, i think infrared does this. It's important to see through dust clouds
 cegprakash: does anyone have a number on average no. of turns in a game?
 cegprakash: in legend/gold
 AntiSquid: ok the randomness in this game is getting really ugly
 AntiSquid: i mean the leaderboard
 Nerchio: yes&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: not the game
 MSmits: worse than ooc isnt it AntiSquid?
 cegprakash: Nerchio what is it
 Nerchio: its a lot worse than ooc in my opinion
 cegprakash: oh the randomness
 AntiSquid: ooc was nowhere near as bad as this MSmits, in fact i don't remember ooc being random, but maybe i forgot about it
 AntiSquid: this is like fking lottery 
 Nerchio: :D
 cegprakash: it's random because lot of good bots with bugs exist in gold
 MSmits: it was pretty random when i tried to get past gold boss and I do seem to remember you complaining about it too. Might have been someone else though
 AntiSquid: good bots with bugs :thinking: lol
 MSmits: cegprakash bugs are not the reason
 cegprakash: yeah good bots with bugs will be in bottom usually
 AntiSquid: ah i remember now MSmits, there was some randomness true, but i think that was about 20 ranks
 AntiSquid: this can be 100 - 300 ranks difference from submit to submit
 MSmits: the reason for the randomness is that even if one bot is generally a lot better than another, one unlucky turn by a pac may offset this difference
 MSmits: and there is luck involved due to hidden information
 0xCAFE: Heeeellll, i was so close of beating the gold boss. I was 3rd.. Now i'm 9th&#160;:(
 0xCAFE: Rip me
 AntiSquid: maybe the number of pellets needs to be increase / arena size&#160;?
 Braykin08: I feel you
 Cappefra: I just submitted and I'm feeling unlucky
 Hvosten: I cant advance to gold, righ after the boss :D
 AntiSquid: mandatory random loss streak commenced
 MSmits: I know the feeling of being stuck behind gold boss too. I always got past eventually, but one time as late as 1 am on the last day, when i refused to go to bed until legend
 MSmits: this is why i am saying, no sleep!
 Cappefra: ooc was my first contest and this one's my second, made gold in both but no legend
 0xCAFE: I think, I'm gonna sleep instead
 Hvosten: And you submit the same algorithm?
 0xCAFE: It's my first contest
 NinjaDoggy: I don't think I'll be able to last day promote to legend this contest&#160;:(
 Hvosten: my too
 0xCAFE: It's not so bad
 Cappefra: I didn't really try in ooc though, when I made gold I was like I'M OUTTA HERE
 Cappefra: but I was hoping for legend this time, it's frustrating to see my 2-day-old bot doing better than anything other I've tried even though I've objectively solved some bugs
 MSmits: wow NinjaDoggy, you have top 3 achiev
 cegprakash: Cappefra been there done that
 NinjaDoggy: yea! COIF :D
 0xCAFE: Yeah same. It can be frustrating
 AntiSquid: NinjaDoggy, if chodukai did then so can you&#160;! :p
 0xCAFE: The problem with this game is that it's too random
 MSmits: well done that NinjaDoggy
 cegprakash: what I did was Cappefra I installed winmerge and made a middle version between current and old
 AntiSquid: 1 day legend
 cegprakash: and then use that version to move ahead
 Cappefra: tried that too, though manually
 Cappefra: it's pretty much what I'm submitting now but it doesn't seem like it's moving from bottom gold, the other one was mid-gold
 Scarfield: chodukai-san would have gotten legend the first day, if he joined the first dat :o
 reCurse: *chokudai
 AntiSquid: i just use diffinity to compare versions (old style i guess, since others use the command line)
 AntiSquid: say his name 3 times and he will appear, reCurse
 Scarfield: Biggie-smalls, Biggie-smalls
 Scarfield: ..
 AntiSquid: i guess he doesn't need the screen
 SkyDreamer: hi
 Scarfield: he doesnt even need a keyboard
 SkyDreamer: how to sort a char Array in alphabetical order depite upper or lower case?
 AntiSquid: that depends on the language
 AntiSquid: which language are you using? 
 SkyDreamer: java
 AntiSquid: also it's best to google these kind of questions, there are tons of examples of how to do stuff for all languages
 SkyDreamer: Arrays.sort gives upper case first
 AntiSquid: well most language (popular ones)
 Clagus: this game is nuts... xD<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466769637">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466769637</a>how to loose 4/5 pacs and not loose a game? LUCK! :D
 ashelkov: how to loose all pacs and not loose a game? ))
 Clagus: that's almost what happened
 AntiSquid: happened multiple times to many and surely to many others
 Durkin: phew, I'm tuckered all out on this contest, but was looking over old ones and saw tron, god doing a tron bot is fun
 Durkin: need to revisit it
 MSmits: there are many fun games on CG
 MSmits: if you like simple games, try one of the many board games

 Cappefra: 105 people in legend
 Cappefra: If nerchio doesn't make it there's no way I'll make it
 Nerchio: lol :p
 Nerchio: dont base your success on other people
 Nerchio: i didnt code too much for the past 5 days for this contest
 Cappefra: no but you're good and today you've been trying to beat the league from a position that was already better than mine lol
 Nerchio: i started last league same as you so not sure what you mean 'good' :p
 Cappefra: made legend in ooc is enough for "good" haha
 Nerchio: ok :p
 AntiSquid: ya ooc legend is really good imo
 Nerchio: it had a lot going on but i think it was simpler to come up with what you actually need
 Nerchio: than this xD
 Cappefra: I'm totally with you on this
 Cappefra: this is frustrating af
 Cappefra: "I KNOW WHAT'LL DO IT *tap tap tap submit drops 300 ranks"
 CowZow: Wowz, this was a really impressive trap case handled by romka: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/466784361">https://www.codingame.com/replay/466784361</a>
 cegprakash: 9 wins in first 12.. after a long time.. may be good submit?
 Clagus: CowZow - but he seems to completely ignore the big pellet right before his eyes :D
 Clagus: don't know how can you do it on such a high level xD
 Kukiss: CowZow that still very interesting that he did not consume the last super pellet after the kill
 Clagus: that's what I just said
 CowZow: Hmmm good point, yeah that is interesting
 CowZow: I wonder what kind of interactions were at play there
 Daher: Hello 
 Kukiss: oh, sorry Clagus :D  just watched the match and typed before following the chat 
 cegprakash: AntiSquid turn 21 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466789302">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466789302</a> u don't have anti accident yet?
 AntiSquid: i don't hear anyone else mention anti accident
 AntiSquid: see *
 cegprakash: everyone does it
 cegprakash: just that nobody tells you
 cegprakash: nobody dies in accident in legend league
 cegprakash: at least when it's obvious
 cegprakash: like this case
 Cappefra: how do you avoid that? the turn he sees it is when he gets eaten
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: he should create a danger zone around him
 cegprakash: based on what he saw in the past
 cegprakash: and where my pacs were
 cegprakash: in the past
 AntiSquid: i have a tracker, it's incomplete, that's about it
 Cappefra: that doesn't seem like an obvious case tbh
 AntiSquid: maybe calling it a tracker is better&#160;?
 cegprakash: I like not dying to accidents
 cegprakash: I call it anti accidents
 Doju: Are there always 4 super pellets?
 AntiSquid: es
 AntiSquid: yes
 Doju: thanks
 MSmits: thats more like a day 2 question :P
 Doju: :D
 cegprakash: wait what
 cegprakash: I thought it's random
 Doju: well, my pacs have been doing all the thinking for me MSmits
 Cappefra: none of you is switching after turn 91 there
 MSmits: ah ok, thats good Doju
 AntiSquid: switching there is bad Cappefra
 AntiSquid: usually
 AntiSquid: well depends on enemy
 cegprakash: Cappefra that's the best move there 
 cegprakash: u switch u lose the pellet to opponent
 AntiSquid: that's one annoying corner case of the contest
 AntiSquid: me standing there is a mistake though lol
 AntiSquid: it's my last pac
 AntiSquid: could switch though, have nothing to lose and am behind points, cegprakash
 AntiSquid: but generally didn't seem to be good idea
 Cappefra: that's kinda the only play adjustment I make
 AntiSquid: need more if else
 cegprakash: u have everything to lose AntiSquid
 cegprakash: that 1 pellet changes things
 Cappefra: play-style I meant
 cegprakash: than ur life
 faresnaoui: hello everybode:)
 AntiSquid: it's 1 pac vs 3, i should switch at that frame lol
 AntiSquid: then it's 1 vs 2 . so 
 Zenoscave: ceg I have a question for your anti-accident stuff
 Zenoscave: Can I PM you?
 cegprakash: What I don't have yet is this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466804226">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466804226</a>
 Kukiss: that's a nice play there
 Hvosten: After four days finally gold &lt;3
 Hvosten: I can go sleep :D
 Hvosten: good luck
 Kukiss: gz&#160;:)
 cegprakash: gz
 Cappefra: cegprakash
 Cappefra: woah that play tho
 Doju: gz Hvosten
 Doju: Okay, a few more tweaks
 Doju: maybe 2 more features
 Doju: then i'm done
 AntiSquid: hvosten no sleep till legend!
 AntiSquid: no sleep till legend Doju
 Doju: stop it pls
 Doju: I'm kinda tempted but lets be honest
 Doju: without some major improvements that not gonna happen :D
 Cappefra: I don't even know what I'm still trying to do here
 Cappefra: Same Dou
 Cappefra: Doju
 AntiSquid: nobody took the big pellet
 Doju: Oh you're right next to me in rankings Cappefra
 EvModder: i take a break for 6 hours, come back, and i'm #16.no changes to my code whatsoever
 AntiSquid: and you were #5 or so before eh&#160;?
 EvModder: i'm starting to think that not participating is the best strat xD
 EvModder: very briefly
 EvModder: i don't know if i'll finish in top 20 tbh, but i will try and put some time in
 AntiSquid: was a joke, that you dropped 5 to 16 without changing code
 EvModder: i went from 50 -&gt; 16 without changing code
 EvModder:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: good
 Cappefra: Doju I just lost 200 ranks though
 EvModder: yes, but how do i replicate this tactic lol
 Doju: :o
 Doju: how'd that happen Cappefra?
 Cappefra: cause I'm still trying shit that I hope works and inevitably doesn't
 AntiSquid: probably leave bot as is and only test in IDE until you 100% sure about the change though even 100% isn't enouhg in this game&#160;:/
 Doju: This feels dumb
 Doju: i'm bringing a variable along a  loong chain of functions
 Doju: when in reality only the last one needs it
 Doju:&#160;:/
 EvModder: i have a function header with 9 parameters...
 EvModder: and most of them are maps, sets, or vectors
 EvModder: wait did i say 9? apparently it's 13
 EvModder: that's how bad my code is right now xD
 Doju: fixed it
 Doju: Object oriented programming for the win :P
 EvModder: :D
 Doju: EvModder yeh my code was decent-ish with everything pretty much organized
 Doju: until this morning when i needed performance for magic math
 EvModder: ahahha yes
 Doju: now it's all a huge mess
 stakka: do pacs also 'see' via the wrap around?
 stakka: if a pellet is on a straight line on the other side of the map and there is no wall in between
 Doju: Ohh shoot
 Spifflejedi: yes it will be seen
 stakka: thanks
 Doju: mine dont hahhah
 Spifflejedi: the pellet will be in the list&#160;;)
 Doju: wait no, that doesnt matter...
 EvModder: LOL
 Doju: i swear they do stupid things around the border
 EvModder: yeah i've had some problems with it
 Doju: maybe it's just my imagination
 EvModder: my manhattan_dist() was bad for a long time with the border
 EvModder: there would be a deadly enemy and my pac would just walk onto them
 Spifflejedi: manhattan distance does not consider the potential wall
 Hvosten: I also used manhattan metric, later switched to graphs path finding. How many lines of code do you have?
 Doju: Hvosten 1130 and counting
 Doju: although maybe 100 of that are old commented out things
 Hvosten: 675 :D
 Dr-D: Time to remove all those comments
 Dr-D:&#160;;)
 Dr-D: I write too slow =(
 Spifflejedi: 1250
 EvModder: nice
 muy31: yo Doju we finally made it!
 EvModder: i have a ton of comments, currently 1400
 Doju: muy31 we did it!
 EvModder: i will probably be able to trim it down to 1000 the end, if i can manage to clean it up
 Hvosten: Doju I am after you in the ranking :D
 Hvosten: not right now :D
 Doju: :p
 Cappefra: submit's slow af right now
 Nerchio: y
 AntiSquid: i trimmed 400 lines from my code, could do more, but only did bare minimum to make it more readable
 Xlos:  I'm only around 600 xd
 Xlos: Though I don't have many comments
 cegprakash: why am I selecting cars when I'm supposed to select crosswalks
 Braykin08: made it to legend. Finally
 Doju: graatz Braykin08
 cegprakash: just in time Braykin08
 cegprakash: biw grab some snacks
 cegprakash: coz u deserve it
 cegprakash: AntiSquid doesn't
 ZarthaxX: that's kind of rude
 pde-bakk: I hope to reach legend too tonight, but the difference in score between the top and me seems so  big
 Braykin08: Now that this is done. How many hours did y'all spent?
 ZarthaxX: that's relative pde-bakk
 Doju: Waaayyy too many
 Braykin08: I but be at like 50h?
 Doju: like...
 Doju: 11 days? * 15 h
 Doju: xD
 pde-bakk: @ZarthaxX im ~100 in gold, need like 4 more score points but that is so much
 Braykin08: Don't give up pde-bakk. I spent 2 days hovering in top 10 golds until I made the right improvement
 pde-bakk: what was that improvement, or do you prefer not to spill?
 Braykin08: I'll stay broad. Opponent prediction
 pde-bakk: Yeah thats something ive been meaning to get to but damn
 Clagus: the easiest way is to calculate enemy moves just like you do with your pacs
 Doju: that'd make me time out&#160;:-D
 Clagus: :D
 pde-bakk: true but I dont have as much time for that as C++ people do
 Clagus: I'm talking c#
 Clagus: that's what I do anyways
 AntiSquid: ceg be more humble, i beat boss for you to reach legend
 Clagus: :P
 pde-bakk: Im talking Ruby
 Braykin08: I might have misspoke. I don't not predict where they will go, but where they went
 pde-bakk: yeah I understand, that was my plan too
 Braykin08: Goddamn legend is ranking up fast. I'm now 38th lol. How many hiders are there?
 pde-bakk: what are hiders?
 Braykin08: People who "hide' their bot by not submitting it until the end
 pde-bakk: to not reveal their strategies, so people cant counter them?
 pde-bakk: I thought the entire point of legend was to keep coming up with new strats to counter opponents
 Braykin08: Not submitting doesn't mean you cant counter them by playing what they submitted last
 AntiSquid: ah there are fun last minute submits that even get #1 in the contest
 AntiSquid: not always
 AntiSquid: and less likely in this RNG fest 
 berries: anyone know when the next contest is?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: not announcedd
 JBM: there is no next contest
 Braykin08: I hope not to seen. I need to take time off lol
 Braykin08: soon*
 AntiSquid: there were only like 2 weeks between ooc and this one
 pde-bakk: I didnt do the ooc one, but did a run of Fantastic bits that the 42network hosted
 pde-bakk: which was only like a month ago too
 Doju: Lets see how many things i actually did from the to-do list
 AntiSquid: lol the 42 was private club
 Doju: "enemy memory &amp; prediction" no
 Doju: "probabilities" yes
 Nerchio: yeah antisquid haha :D
 Nerchio: this is the one we were trying to find 
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl I found a  bug in ur bot
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466862245">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466862245</a>
 cegprakash: or is it intentional suicide?
 Doju: i did like 8/14 depending on how you count them. Pretty decent&#160;:-D
 Chkoupinator: is it guaranteed that we see an enemy before it gets killed by our bot (supposing both walk in the same cell after being in a corner)?
 Chkoupinator: I suppose not?
 RoboStac: nope, thats why the dead pacs were given in silver
 RoboStac: so you could tell that had happened
 Chkoupinator: wells hit
 Chkoupinator: well shit*
 Chkoupinator: I'm still in bronze
 Chkoupinator: I don't understand why it makes sense to give more info on higher leagues though lol
 Chkoupinator: especially one that's this crucial 
 RoboStac: it was more it was missing and needed adding and they didn't want to break the existing bronze bots
 RoboStac: it's not really that useful 
 SkyDreamer: can i delete an object in java?
 Nerchio: no
 SkyDreamer: so if i create an int array, i cant recreate it later
 Nerchio: if it doesnt have references it will be removed by garbage collector
 Nerchio: i mean you can if you have a reference to it
 SkyDreamer: well u cant change size of an array once its created
 Nerchio: so maybe use a list if you need a changing size
 SkyDreamer: but arraylist u can only add slots never reduce i think
 Nerchio: it does shrink when you remove elements
 cegprakash: how to play on this seed: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466876237">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466876237</a>
 Nerchio: you have expert mode enabled?
 SkyDreamer: to remove i only need to ArrayList = null; right?
 Nerchio: hmm not sure aboutthat
 Xlos: I've got a new record, my code has 7 end braces in a row with no code in between
 pde-bakk: ahahah @cegprakash he doesnt mind keeping you stuck there forever, you could send a paperpac to unstuck yours and have a man advantage
 Xlos: It's not even nested in a class, just a void function with quickly ending logic
 RockyMullet: hum, my sim works, but its all buggued
 RockyMullet: no time to debug that...
 drykberg: stupid question: what would be the reason if pacs don't move continously, but rater stop-and-go like?
 drykberg: also several of my pacs only receive commands every other round or so? hmm too slow? too many conditions to check etc?
 duckquackduck: other pacmans are probably using speed
 drykberg: i just got into bronze
 duckquackduck: the ones not using speed, will move slowly @drykberg
 drykberg: in wood they all move normally
 drykberg: ah okay, i see, indeed, the enemy uses speed in the beginning but then they also move slowly, i get it
 drykberg: in bronze i have to give pacs commands ingame? 
 drykberg: oh well.. thank you. Very big help already
 duckquackduck: np. what you mean in game? you need to prove each pacman command every round
 drykberg: well idk, maybe im confused. There were indications here and there that I can change the code or pass in values while the game is played
 drykberg: i probably misunderstood that, i hope so, coz i rather not do that
 drykberg: ah okay so now, not just MOVE 1 2 3, but also SPEED 1 or SWITCH 1 ROCK
 MarekM: LORD BETRAYUS (timed out), just wow
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh so that's why my rank dropped so suddenly
 BenjaminUrquhart: they broke java stuff
 berries: is the time limit when submissions close or when leaderboards close
 duckquackduck: submissions close
 ZarthaxX: berries game will be available after finishing prob
 Doju: i really need to go to bed&#160;:/
 Doju: Just one more feature though :p
 Doju: and then maybe some variable analysis
 Doju: now i have extra_magic_values
 Chkoupinator: I know the feel lol, been fasting these days and both yesterday and today I didn't eat for an additional ~ 1h (more the day before, about 30 mins today) for the sake of adding something to this heh
 Doju: same lol
 Doju: or really the problem is that going to the shop takes time away from this :D
 cegprakash: I struggle to get to super pellets on this seed: seed=8258687542604494800
 BenjaminUrquhart: wait no
 cegprakash: what
 BenjaminUrquhart: I was looking you up in the leaderboard but the chat window stole my keyboard focus
 cegprakash: don worry I'll win this
 cegprakash: I'm hiding my best bot
 cegprakash: will there be more games during final calc?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 cegprakash: why do I have a huge bug on this seed&#160;:"(
 Doju: oh shoot
 Doju: i timed out
 Doju: i think...
 thethiny: @Doju yo gratz on the gold
 Doju: thx thethiny
 thethiny: I was checking and I have 3 major bugs in my code, but I ain't gonna fix them, I will rank lower than what I am now and there's only 8 hours left
 thethiny: not worth it
 Doju: :o
 Doju: why not
 thethiny: If I resubmit I'll stay in gold 
 thethiny: but my rank will go back to 500
 thethiny: and I'm happy with #371
 ZarthaxX: thethiny just do it
 Doju: mmkay
 ZarthaxX: i also did that in the past but then ended submitting
 ZarthaxX: you will regret
 thethiny: @ZarthaxX I'll just consider the competition over
 Doju: i'm so lost
 Doju: i have a million different arrays
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:( ok
 Doju: im not used to this D:
 thethiny: XD
 thethiny: guys let's compare Lines of Code
 thethiny: how much do you have
 Doju: 1020 pretty much all working code
 thethiny: mine is 1455
 cegprakash: 1500
 MarekM: python 720
 thethiny: nice we're around the same
 Doju: my magic method just doesn't want to cooperate anymore
 thethiny: this is the biggest amount of code I've ever written in 1 file
 Doju: same
 Doju: and biggest coding project anyways
 berries: can the pac see through the wrapped line of sight in bronze
 thethiny: yes
 morning_cloud: I am at 451 lines
 Doju: oh what the hell rofl
 Doju: why do i have 8 rows in this array
 Dr-D: 447 (bronze)
 Doju: not 5 for the number of pacs or like 250 for the number of cells but 8?!
 shatteredcube: enemy pacs or double counting your own pacs?
 drykberg: is it a bad approach to control pacs using if conditions?
 Doju: not really i dont think so shatteredcube
 drykberg: is there any other way even? ^^
 pde-bakk: no there isnt drykberg
 drykberg: okay ^^
 pde-bakk: see what the conditions are like, and act based on the information you have
 Dr-D: Or train an NN&#160;;)
 cegprakash: does anyone else feel so hard with this seed seed=8258687542604494800
 Dr-D: There are many roads to improve
 drykberg: has anyone done that? train a nn?
 thethiny: I don't think so
 drykberg: is that even possible? not really is it?
 thethiny: cuz all the top are C++
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466960543">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466960543</a> this map&#160;:@&#160;:@
 Dr-D: Usually there lots of the top coders here share there approach in the forum one the content ends
 Dr-D: I bet there is at least one
 Dr-D: Evaluation of the submit is sooo slow - I should use the time to write a new feature to it =D
 AntiSquid: ofc it's possible drykberg, but who has time in a week to do it for this complicated game? i am no expert maybe someone can do it
 Doju: Oh it's been working all along
 Doju: lol
 Doju: not sure how i got the length of eight
 cegprakash: AntiSquid I found a bug and I've no idea how to fix it
 cegprakash: this is weird
 cegprakash: so what I do is
 cegprakash: I get closest pellet to all my pacs
 cegprakash: greedily from my pac index 0
 cegprakash: also greedily choosing pellets
 Dr-D: Improved by 3k!
 Dr-D: O.O
 cegprakash: so the star pellet usually goes to id=&gt;0 and id=&gt;1
 Dr-D: Steps are big in bronze =D
 cegprakash: now say I got 4 pacs
 cegprakash: *5 pacs
 cegprakash: and the id 4 is in a better position to eat this star pellet
 cegprakash: how do I command it
 cegprakash: :O
 cegprakash: right now I swap stuff randomly
 cegprakash: based on sum of distances
 Dr-D: check distances from every one of your pac to every super pellet and send the closest? remember that choice for the next round&#160;;)
 cegprakash: unfortunately I"m simming
 cegprakash: and I don't predict enemy will steal my star pellet
 Doju: whaa
 thethiny: I'm not simming but MY PACS eat MY Star Pellets
 BenjaminUrquhart: same
 thethiny: that's the bug I was talking about
 cegprakash: that hurts&#160;:'(
 BenjaminUrquhart: until something breaks
 Doju: im giving the pellets some negative value based on the average distance to other pacs
 thethiny: or
 thethiny: you can do something easier 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm breaking everything
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's a great strategy
 thethiny: give the other pacs a value of -5
 thethiny: * the distance
 Doju: but changing the constant that does that 
 Doju: does nothing??
 thethiny: less expensive
 cegprakash:&#160;:'(
 cegprakash: Suppose I have 20 games on this seed
 cegprakash: think about it
 cegprakash: I will lose all 20
 cegprakash: and think about all the seeds similar to this
 Doju: anybody got a perfectly deterministic bot?
 thethiny: what does deterministic means
 Doju: it doesnt have randomness
 thethiny: yeah mine
 Dr-D: Not even a bit randomness?
 Dr-D: O.o
 thethiny: I don't need it
 thethiny: why do I need randomness
 thethiny: there isn't a single random decision here
 thethiny: if you're stuck by a friend, give pass to the biggest path value
 thethiny: if you're stuck with enemy, then switch, else keep getting stuck
 thethiny: if he's not cooldown
 thethiny: then run away
 Doju: I have no idea why but it seems like my pacs are just wiggling about
 Doju: going back and forth
 thethiny: Here's me against myself<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466986148">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/466986148</a>

 thethiny: Playing Astronomia when I am sure I'm dying
 Dr-D: Dmnd - found an endless loop in my code -.-
 drykberg: is it possible to get to silver with randomness&#160;? :sweat_smile:
 Dr-D: calculate line of sight with a straight line without any wall 
 thethiny: :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: drykberg why random
 Doju: maybe because there's 7 hours left
 drykberg: because i dont know how to do pathfinding or any of that business work...
 drykberg: how*
 thethiny: what language?
 drykberg: works*
 drykberg: C :grinning:
 drykberg: im a hard beginner at coding...
 thethiny: Hard Beginner + Path Finding in C?
 thethiny: I suggest you find another language
 drykberg: thats why im not doing pathfinding :grinning:
 drykberg: although, 7 hours to go! who knows how far my motivation takes me :joy:
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm slowly being pushed up, probably because people are spam submitting and failing
 thethiny: same
 BenjaminUrquhart: what place are you in thethiny
 thethiny: #377
 thethiny: I've beaten you now haha
 BenjaminUrquhart: I broke stuff ok
 thethiny: üòÇüòÇüòÇ

 Doju: yes
 thethiny: okay can I PM you?
 Doju: sure
 Doju: oh my god the sun is starting to rise
 thethiny: dun dun dun
 FrancoisFavier: guys, do you think that a 20 can be push in silver to gold or it's too late&#160;?
 Dr-D: Just depends on your coding and ideas I guess
 Dr-D: maybe your level of tiredness, too&#160;;)
 Doju: oh...
 Doju: now i know what my bug is
 Doju: these are the values for each pellet on the map
 Doju: [inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf inf
 Dr-D: O.o
 Dr-D: Not a good base to choose wisely =D
 Doju: wdym? its a perfect situation
 Dr-D: division by zero?
 Doju: every possible decision leads to infinite value
 Dr-D: Well. So random would be the same =D

 Doju: cyq
 BenjaminUrquhart: so, I've somehow screwed up A* and now my bot is searching to a depth of 550 before timing out
 Doju: o.o
 Doju: hey umm anybody got tips on tweaking constants?
 solaimanope: gold is going up and up&#160;:(
 thethiny: @Doju which constants?
 Doju: thethiny all of them
 thethiny: I mean
 Doju: dealing with probabilities mostly
 thethiny: in my case, constants mean values for enemies/friends, for you what do you mean
 Doju: i dont wanna go into specifics
 Chkoupinator: I think the part where they explain that the pacs cannot see through walls should have had at least one pacman in a corner so that we know that we can't see diagonally ...
 Doju: just in general constants that change how pacs make decisions
 thethiny: okay

 thethiny: XD
 Doju: but how do you like figure out which is the best combination?
 thethiny: I don't
 Doju: lol
 thethiny: I just ran it with different values
 thethiny: until it behaved as I want
 thethiny: basically I just pick a lost match
 thethiny: and monitor the movement
 thethiny: change this values up or down based on what happened until I win
 thethiny: then I repeat for all losses
 thethiny: once I win them all then I save
 Doju: okay
 Doju: ty
 thethiny: as to why I have "-20", it's cuz if I had -10, then eating a big pellet and dying with an enemy = 0, which means it's fine
 thethiny: but it isn't, dying isn't fine. Since my max step size is 10, so it's -(big pellet value + max steps)
 thethiny: which is 20
 thethiny: so if i'm gonna die there's no way a path crossing an enemy will give me a good score
 Doju: oh okay now i found which one was the important one
 Doju: at least against my submitted bot
 Doju: pellet_distance_power = 1
 Doju: this one :P
 thethiny: great :D
 thethiny: guys what are the dimensions for the banners
 thethiny: cover banners
 gitKad: I don't understand how the new rule in the silver league can be leveraged to improve my bot...
 thethiny: it won't improve, just be an obstacle
 gitKad: How is it a new obstacle?
 gitKad: I mean... I don't see why I would change anything about my code from bronze to silver. They perform just as well... nothing really changed with that new rule.
 gitKad: Unless I missed something about it
 cegprakash: oh jeez
 cegprakash: what's the maximum distance a pac and pellet can be
 cegprakash: I had 1(00-dist)^3 in my eval and now that's ruined because  dist is negative
 Zenoscave: Should you go for exploration or memory pellets first?
 Zenoscave: If no pellets are visible
 berries: how do you use speed
 berries: is it in the same command just twice 
 Doju: SPEED 0
 Doju: for pac id 0
 BenjaminUrquhart: I got captcha'd 
 BenjaminUrquhart: this is not what a need
 berries: yeah but like for the speed turn how do i use it 
 BenjaminUrquhart: you don't
 Doju: oh right
 cegprakash: 4 hours debuggihng 1 seed
 BenjaminUrquhart: you specify a spot 2 units away
 Doju: you need to give the move command 2 cells away
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 berries: ahhhh okay thanks 
 berries: so the turn that i activate speed i cant move during it?
 Doju: that's also true
 berries: okay okay i get it now thank you 
 cegprakash: I'm in a sad rank
 Zenoscave: cegprakash seed doesn't effect much predictably
 cegprakash: but
 cegprakash: it's an important decision making
 cegprakash: it can affect many games
 cegprakash: I'm not taking the big pellet in legend
 cegprakash: this is a huge bug
 cegprakash: which I'm unable to fix
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 thethiny: what do u guys think of my banner<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/undefined">https://imgur.com/undefined</a>
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2gmYccM">https://imgur.com/a/2gmYccM</a>
 thethiny: ffs imgur
 cegprakash: I find 4 best pellets
 cegprakash: and random shuffle them
 cegprakash: and give score for each matching
 cegprakash: and try to maximize this score
 cegprakash: it's like a sim inside sim
 cegprakash: and it's not working
 cegprakash: search inside search
 Zenoscave: Ceg just do Hungararian Algorithm
 Zenoscave: Finds optimal assignment
 thethiny: what is coders strike back
 cegprakash: u mean a maxflow?
 cegprakash: Zenoscave
 Doju: oh right
 Doju: no wonder why this wasnt working
 Zenoscave: no.
 Zenoscave: Cost assignment munkres
 Doju: im giving the cells extra value for being closer to other pacs
 Doju: stupid me
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://csclab.murraystate.edu/~bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html">https://csclab.murraystate.edu/~bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html</a>
 cegprakash: too many steps
 cegprakash: can be very slow
 Zenoscave: nope.
 Zenoscave: Works in O(n^3) fastest known algo for cost assignment
 blini.cat: while using python, do you prefere deque from collections or queue?
 Zenoscave: heapqueue
 Doju: i'm using collections.deque
 cegprakash: n^3? yuck
 thethiny: @blini.cat deque cuz of popleft
 Zenoscave: ceg brute force is n!
 Zenoscave: trust me just try it. or save it till after competition for consideration
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave i dont think hungarian makes sense here
 Zenoscave: Why not ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: for assigning pellets objectives i mean
 ZarthaxX: the costs are not independant of others decisions
 ZarthaxX: paths cross etc
 Zenoscave: Ah that makes sense.
 Zenoscave: Well time to fix that...
 ZarthaxX: hi btw
 ZarthaxX: pewpew :O
 Zenoscave: pewpewpew
 Doju: whatever
 Doju: im submitting this and never touching it again unless its timing ouyt
 Icebox: pewpewpew
 dbdr: kovi, staying up all night?&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Hi Icebox
 Zenoscave: long time
 Icebox: long time indeed
 Zenoscave: Took a break?
 Icebox: missed last contest
 Icebox: so yeah, kinda
 SparshMc07: where r u guys from?
 abuhuraira071: You can see via profile.
 Chkoupinator: are there always 4 big pellets?
 Icebox: yes
 Chkoupinator: thanc
 solaimanope: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467052043">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/467052043</a>
 solaimanope: epic ending
 cegprakash: why isn't the clock blinking
 cegprakash: solaimanope  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81</a>
 Icebox: not yet
 cegprakash: Icebox cheer for me
 Icebox: I think down from 4h
 Icebox: I'd rather not :upside_down:
 cegprakash: have u ever lived inside an Icebox Icebox
 ZarthaxX: :face_palm:
 Icebox: ofc
 Icebox: my natural habitat
 ZarthaxX: i live inside those
 cegprakash: wow
 cegprakash: cold hurts me
 cegprakash: I loves heat
 cegprakash: my rank is 69
 cegprakash: me likes that
 VicHofs: arguably better than rank 1
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: 69 &gt; 1
 RustyCrown: is the outside of the tunnels considered wall tile?
 cegprakash: sometimes yes sometimes not
 BenjaminUrquhart: "vell yes but actually no"
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok so
 BenjaminUrquhart: apparently my bot sucks at late-game exploration
 BenjaminUrquhart: it does really well in the beginning and drops the ball in endgame
 ashikujjaman: what is the extra statement in gold league?
 VicHofs: plus a ton of other stuff same here BenjaminUrquhart
 VicHofs: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: none
 cegprakash: I have lot of todos but I'm stuck on this bug
 Kellthazar: ashikujjaman none
 ashikujjaman: so it's the problem about efficiency?
 eulerscheZahl: wow. bots improved a lot during the night
 ashelkov: not sleep is a secret))
 Icebox: jesus it's 5am
 eulerscheZahl: 5:15
 RustyCrown: whats a good way to handle collisions
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl I dropped 300 places
 Icebox: morning toad :wave:
 BenjaminUrquhart: they sure did implrove
 BenjaminUrquhart: improve*
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u can now submit ur bot which u are hiding
 eulerscheZahl: i dropped by 100%
 VicHofs: RustyCrown I calculate what move that if done would lead each stuck pac to the other and reverse it
 eulerscheZahl: i was never hiding. my bot just sucks
 cegprakash: just kidding
 RustyCrown: ok cool, ill keep that in mind
 RustyCrown: thanks
 cegprakash: my bot is not going to closest super pellet
 cegprakash: I deserve to be in wood
 cegprakash: what am I doing here
 VicHofs: also you can check whether a pac is stuck by a bool check of sorts pac.last_position == pac.position"
 VicHofs: RustyCrown
 kovi: morning
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 RustyCrown: got it.
 cegprakash: this is fun: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sipo2z">https://prnt.sc/sipo2z</a>
 thethiny: is it normal that in brutaltester when I increase the number of threads the matches duplicate?
 thethiny: t 1 n 5 gives me 20-80t 5 n 5 gives me 100-0
 thethiny: no matter how much I repeat
 thethiny: @ceg you told him 200$ lmao
 ashelkov: cegprakash, i've got a similar proposal- to sell the code&#160;:)
 RustyCrown: thats just sad honestly
 eulerscheZahl: ceg :D
 eulerscheZahl: i got almost the same but a different user
 cegprakash: oh come on I spent 10 days and they offer just 200$
 RustyCrown: why bother paying for a ranking, they wont feel fulfilled by it
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: do universities really pay their students for winning this?
 cegprakash: :D
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/ this allows competitors to get "Unofficial" prizes
 thethiny: guys in brutaltester do we have to select the league?
 eulerscheZahl: ramdeath has prizes for his students too
 eulerscheZahl: medals, one even got an internship in a software company
 thethiny: @cegprakash when I was in uni
 thethiny: I got 800$ for winning sth like this
 WINWINWIN: Didn't know that this was that serious
 thethiny: It really is serious
 Durkin: huh, cool, but also can't imagine my college even considering it xD
 RustyCrown: its not that serious, but it does demonstrate knowledge and understanding, especially if you get high ranking
 Cusumi: my colleagues cheating too that's why i asked you for helping me
 BenjaminUrquhart: what
 RustyCrown: you just need to convince them durkin
 WINWINWIN: understandable cusumi
 RustyCrown: then just report your colleague
 Cusumi: i was on the top but somehow they find a code and they share it with each others
 eulerscheZahl: i guess javatar2018 in on your school as well
 eulerscheZahl: as he tried the same
 Cusumi: yes
 Cusumi: i was working all night and day
 WINWINWIN: perhaps they collaborated and made their own code?
 Cusumi: how do you know his username&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: he contacted me with a similar question
 WINWINWIN: What if people try to cheat the system or disturb the school/company leaderboards?Copying code between players is forbidden during contests. We'll thoroughly monitor players' submissions and we reserve ourselves the right to ban any player in case of abuse.
 eulerscheZahl: my advice: talk to your teachers. your best classmates who are about to win prizes have to hold a short presentation
 Cusumi: see
 eulerscheZahl: one will notice when they didn't write the bot on their own
 WINWINWIN: this is in the contest rules, I don't think people would risk it
 eulerscheZahl: and another option: ask codingame (namely [CG]Thibaud) to have a look at those codes
 eulerscheZahl: he has removed some copy-cats in the past already
 Cusumi: if i talk to my teacher all what they will do is a recoding session they will ask them about code
 Cusumi: and that is easy it no gonna solve the problem
 Zenoscave: Cusumi talk to [CG]Thibaud. He can get them disqualified
 thethiny: apparently there's a command called "WAIT" that we can use?
 thethiny: static final Pattern PLAYER_ACTION_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(
 eulerscheZahl: depends on their skill level. i'm pretty sure a beginner won't be able to read and understand my code. but Thibaud is a good option too
 Zenoscave: That is a more reasonable approach than trying to cheat as well
 EvModder: my bot in IDE is consistently losing to submitted code
 EvModder: i am sad
 eulerscheZahl: just do it soon (he should be in office in about 3-4h, still early in Europe)
 WINWINWIN: thethiny not in the rules
 Cusumi: nothing to do in this case even if i reported them everywhere
 thethiny: @WINWINWIN it's in the code though
 Cusumi: all my 10 days work goes for nothing
 Zenoscave: Would you have won if they didn't cheat?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i could actually mention what's going on in the moderators room on discord. there it will be seen for sure. i can't promise any disqualifications but there's a good chance of investigation it least i think
 Cusumi: i was on the top of course if they didn't cheat i won
 thethiny: I think using the same code between ,ultiple users isn't against the rules, right?
 eulerscheZahl: filtering the leaderboard for"California State University"i only find you
 thethiny: is*
 eulerscheZahl: how do i find your classmates?
 WINWINWIN: don't know why you would use "WAIT" tithing, may as well not print a command&#160;:/
 Cusumi: yes i think not problem to use the same code
 thethiny: @WINWINWIN not printing anything will cause you to timeout
 WINWINWIN: That is only if you don't print for all pacs
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud will see when several users submitted the same code.how do we find your classmates who should be checked for possible cheating?
 Cusumi: thank you guys for listening to me
 Cusumi: eulerscheZahl  dm me in private

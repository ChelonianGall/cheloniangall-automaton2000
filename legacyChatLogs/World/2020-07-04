 CiBou: need help there
 Or64bit: Hey guys!I have a question: does bot programming require knowledge about AI or some kind of evolutionary algorithm, or is it about hardcoding stuff?
 Rush_iam: I just got to last league of CodersStrikeBack and hardest it required - is to calc of path in few steps using provided physic's data... lot of trigonometry there and lot of thinking of how to play "smarter" than opponent.Not about hardcoding because each map is random and you have to deal with dynamicly changing conditions.
 Scarfield: Or64bit you dont have to know about AI to start. You can get far with an if else bot
 Scarfield: different kind of search functions is the most used for top bots. Where you simulate the game some turns ahead evaluate if the series of moves was good or bad, and then make your current move according to eval and some search algo
 heavygabriel: wait so are you creating a chess-like algo?
 Astrobytes: Yes, sometimes we use minimax w/ alpha-beta pruning and other extensions, move ordering, transposition tables etc
 Astrobytes: MCTS is also common, BFS + beam search, DFS, SA, GA, flat MC, etc
 Astrobytes: Some people use a machine learning approach
 Hjax: huh wood 1 gained someone new in othello
 Astrobytes: yeah, daninj a crept in like... a ninja
 Hjax: pretty strong too 
 Hjax: looks like if he resubmit he'd be above me 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, decent bot for sure
 Hjax: i want to write a n tuples eval, but it seems like a lot of work 
 Astrobytes: jacek might give you some advice...
 Hjax: i understand it 
 Hjax: its just a lot of code to write 
 Hjax: and im lazy 
 Hjax: got to generate the tuples and the mapping into the weights arrays, then train it a lot, and only then can i see if its an improvement 
 Astrobytes: Stick with improving your eval for now then and work on that one slowly
 Hjax: my eval is terrible and i dont have good ideas for it :P
 Hjax: which is part of why i want to do n-tuples 
 Astrobytes: lol, get yer finger out then :D
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/935a83b9-a393-4c5f-b362-d13f3f0f0b8d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/935a83b9-a393-4c5f-b362-d13f3f0f0b8d</a>
 Hjax: this is my entire eval lol 
 Hjax: board_priority[0] being the corners and board_priority[4] being the squares around the corner 
 Astrobytes: moves, corners and squares next to corners?
 Hjax: yup 
 Hjax: i tried frontiers but it made it worse 
 Astrobytes: You can weight other squares, then there's frontiers, stable discs, disc difference at different stagges
 Astrobytes: *stages
 Hjax: i tried weighting other squares, frontiers, and disc difference 
 Hjax: none of those seemed to be an improvement 
 Hjax: stable discs seemed annoying to implement, so i havent tried that yet 
 Hjax: most n-tuples papers sort of randomly generate the tuples, im wondering if thats better than hand selected ones 
 Astrobytes: I didn't fully read the one I linked before yet tbh
 Hjax: they seem to just say "i want 40 tuples of size 5" and then they pick a starting location, and then randomly pick a neighbor snake style until its the right size 
 Hjax: repeat 40 times
 Astrobytes: Give it a shot, best way to test it
 Hjax: the papers also index into the array with base 3, which seems annoying :P
 Astrobytes: oh, ternary like trit/titboards
 Astrobytes: Bundles of fun
 Hjax: yeah, they use the configuration of the tuple as a base 3 number to index into the weights array 
 Hjax: which is just, gross
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: whats even the fastest way to convert two binary numbers into one base 3 number 
 Hjax: thats not a problem ive tried before 
 Astrobytes: Ask MSmits, he uses it for something, might have been UTTT, not 100%
 heavygabriel: wtf my compiler is eating shit
 heavygabriel: and my IDE too
 heavygabriel: I'm trying to do a public class with standard stuff
 heavygabriel: and it says " Only assignment, call, increment, decrement, await, and new object expressions can be used as a statement"
 heavygabriel: buuut when I insert this code snippet in VSC and I compile &amp; run it, it doesn't give that error!
 heavygabriel: what gives?
 KshitijSharma: Which IDE?
 heavygabriel: nvm I am retarded
 heavygabriel:  so like in C#, you got get and set accessors and you can do shit with it
 heavygabriel: what I basically did with set is instead of doing set=&gt; var name=value; I just did set=&gt; var name;
 struct: doesnt robo also uses Titboards?
 Astrobytes: Not sure tbh
 rak1507: anyone else get really annoyed when people don't share their winning code
 rak1507: how am I supposed to learn
 rak1507:&#160;:(
 struct: What was the puzzle?
 Astrobytes: tag the guy and ask if he wants to share in PM or something
 heavygabriel: what the fuck
 heavygabriel: I managed to do a stackoverflow exception
 nutel: yeah, I think sharing code shoud be enabled by default
 nutel: not everyone bother to share
 RocketRidah: not everyone feels comfortable publishing it. some people may not legally be able to publish it. it's a tricky problem to solve. it would be nice to be asked if we wanted to default to sharing or not at some point in tutorial maybe.
 RocketRidah: I'd second reaching our in private and politely asking if they'd be willing to share or give some pointers.
 RocketRidah: out*
 Schwase: @heavygabriel lol im having the same problem now lol
 freeman42x: hello
 Schwase: anyone have any tips for how to start a dependency graph?
 Schwase: i was thinking of making objects and assigning a "class" or "level" based on how many levels of dependency it has
 heavygabriel: omg
 Schwase: 1d spreadsheet?
 heavygabriel: so don't put your if in a for{} loop
 heavygabriel: it will fuck up
 Schwase: @heavygabriel are you doing 1d spreadsheet too?
 heavygabriel: 1d?
 heavygabriel: wat
 Schwase: are you working on a challenge right now?
 heavygabriel: ye
 Schwase: which one?
 heavygabriel: temps
 heavygabriel: I'm mostly new to programming so I'm using lists now
 heavygabriel: to do that
 Schwase: ah
 Schwase: yeah ArrayList is clutch sometimes
 Schwase: what lang?
 heavygabriel: C#
 heavygabriel: Lists
 Schwase: yep
 Schwase: i know next to nothing about c#
 Schwase: i use java
 Schwase: mostly
 Schwase: and some python
 heavygabriel: I made a class to use instances
 heavygabriel: so I can store the absolute temperature and the temperature
 heavygabriel: I found how to sort it
 heavygabriel: I just need to know how to prioritise positive numbers
 Schwase: i used temp squared
 heavygabriel: wait
 Schwase: am i not supposed to share how to puzzles&#160;:|
 Schwase: like i didnt give you too much i hope
 heavygabriel: can I sort them both by 2 class properties?
 heavygabriel: hold the fucking phone
 Schwase: erm
 Schwase: i know the math side of it
 heavygabriel: not me
 heavygabriel: shit
 Schwase:&#160;?
 Schwase: damn its already 230
 heavygabriel: I can't do something like "if integer 1 and integer 2==integer 1"
 Schwase: why would you do that tho?
 heavygabriel: because I can't sort shit
 heavygabriel: and this POS sorting cannot put positives in front
 heavygabriel: so imma go full retard and do it manually
 heavygabriel: bruh I can't do list.reverse(index 0,1)
 heavygabriel: wow
 heavygabriel: it actually worked
 heavygabriel: 69 lines of codes
 heavygabriel: for like a 30 line problem
 RocketRidah: line count is just one of the many metrics you could use to judge code quality. it's not the one I use though&#160;:)
 HelloWorld183L: hey guys, does the Defibrillator puzzle really require an exact position or just really close? I don't know how I am supposed to use exact arithmetic in C# whilst working with Math lib trig functions
 Schwase: exact
 Schwase: im not familiar with c# so im sorry but i cant really address the code related part of your question
 HelloWorld183L: ah ok
 heavygabriel: search for Math. methods?
 heavygabriel: idk
 HelloWorld183L: how would you do exact arithmetic in your language then? Just as you would normally do math?
 Schwase: java: double instead of int
 heavygabriel: yeah OR check only
 heavygabriel: online*
 Schwase: java.lang.Math.cos()
 HelloWorld183L: i've checked online for how to do exact arithmetic in C# and found nothing
 heavygabriel: basically coding languages gives you extra math stuff which helps you
 heavygabriel: that doesn't stop you from doing it manually
 Schwase: use float?
 HelloWorld183L: it fails test case if i use float
 HelloWorld183L: possibly double too, but i'll check
 Schwase: iDk WhAt ThAt MeAnS
 Schwase: xd
 Schwase: sorry
 HelloWorld183L: it's fine
 eulerscheZahl: floating point arithmetic is accurate enough
 HelloWorld183L: might not be accurate enough by this puzzle's standards
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you didn't convert between degrees and radians?
 HelloWorld183L: i have, because i wouldn't have passed the first test case?
 Schwase: nah its radians by default
 eulerscheZahl: trust me: the puzzle is perfectly solvable. it's a bug in your code, not a lack of accuracy
 Schwase: the problem gives you an equation
 heavygabriel: wait what is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 heavygabriel: what
 eulerscheZahl: the input is given in degrees
 heavygabriel: I GOT 60%
 Schwase: oh yeah
 Schwase: youre right
 heavygabriel: -273 alone fails!
 heavygabriel: why? because I made a very retarded bit of code
 heavygabriel: that multiplies the already value by -1
 Schwase: @euler coordinates right?
 Schwase: been a bit since i did that puzzle
 heavygabriel: wanna see that code?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, defibrilator coords are given in degrees, while the formula requires radians
 heavygabriel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4feb59fe-1b7a-4bc3-aebd-bf7bf36a0ef5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4feb59fe-1b7a-4bc3-aebd-bf7bf36a0ef5</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i only remember this because it's commonly asked on the chat
 heavygabriel: that is cringe code
 Schwase: i got away with it in java i think
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes testcases are poorly designed
 Schwase: yeah
 HelloWorld183L: ok i'm using all doubles and i'm failing the 2nd test case, so I'll see if i'm converting properly
 heavygabriel: wow I got a popup that says "are you a pro coder"
 Schwase: im doing rectangle partition and i got 88
 Schwase: with 100 in test cases
 heavygabriel: after doing 60% on a "easy"
 eulerscheZahl: i don't remember getting such a popup
 heavygabriel: that's how I translated it
 heavygabriel: might be a tad innacurate
 Schwase: also horserace is disappointing because the only hard test case gives you the horses' powers in descending order
 heavygabriel: and like one is like "no, I am a student programmer"
 heavygabriel: should I click on that?
 Schwase: @euler did you do 1d spreadsheet?
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't really matter what you click there heavygabriel
 heavygabriel: ik
 eulerscheZahl: yes Schwase
 Schwase: did you use a dependency tree?
 heavygabriel: OMG CODE BATTLE
 heavygabriel: I'LL USE SHIT CODE
 heavygabriel: TO WORKL
 eulerscheZahl: i just computed the values one after another. using recursion if necessary
 Schwase: i got like 80% using a recursive method
 eulerscheZahl: some languages allow deeper recursion than others
 Schwase: yeah i got stackoverflow repeatedly
 heavygabriel: I got stackoverflow'd because I putted all my if() etc in a for loop
 Schwase: i might try to go reverse by using an indexOf() to go backwards to calls of an already evaluated cell within the spreadsheet
 Schwase: like indexOf("$46")
 heavygabriel: omg the clash of code thing is so fun
 heavygabriel: I just couldn't remember what was an exponent called
 Schwase: power?
 Schwase: you mean like power?
 heavygabriel: oh
 heavygabriel: yeah
 heavygabriel: my bad I'm just like directly translating what it's called in my language to english
 Schwase: what language?
 heavygabriel: french
 Schwase: ah wi
 Schwase: haha
 heavygabriel: wow
 heavygabriel: "complete your profile"
 heavygabriel: "add your company"
 heavygabriel: gg
 Schwase: impressed? yes you must be of course
 heavygabriel: also why is there a 10 sec delay between each messages
 heavygabriel: like cmon
 heavygabriel: OMG THERE'S TYPESCRIPT HERE?
 heavygabriel: nope fuck that
 heavygabriel: wow @ the batman thing
 heavygabriel: double arrays?
 heavygabriel: no thank you
 Schwase: that one isnt too bad
 heavygabriel: I mean TBH I've done like multi chained arrays
 heavygabriel: in TS
 heavygabriel: wait medium difficulty?
 heavygabriel: I spend like 3 hours on easy 
 struct: In which puzzle?
 heavygabriel: the temperature one
 heavygabriel: and the space thingy
 Schwase: oof
 eulerscheZahl: space maze?
 heavygabriel: the descent
 heavygabriel: did like a list thingy and shit and the solution took like 3 lines of code
 Schwase: OOF
 eulerscheZahl: i see. there's another space thingy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>
 heavygabriel: was basically if(gay mountain &gt; current mountain) gay mountain=current n shoot it
 StuartWFuller: im trying so hard to get back into programming so thought i would give this a go. man does it make me feel stupid
 heavygabriel: it's ok
 Schwase: what language stuart?
 heavygabriel: rule 0 of programming: search n destroy
 StuartWFuller: c++
 Schwase: ah
 Schwase: nice
 heavygabriel: google shit
 StuartWFuller: I still study at uni but took a year off
 Schwase: keep at it
 heavygabriel: no matter
 heavygabriel: if you're stuck admit it
 StuartWFuller: I havent touched it for a year so i need to refresh 
 heavygabriel: that's not the way to refresh
 heavygabriel: tbh
 heavygabriel: it's more like a "you know the basics, fuck you" type
 StuartWFuller: i just need to get some sort of knowledge back before my final year lol
 heavygabriel: but there's 1 thing you can ask me to do and I'll nail it
 heavygabriel: anything that deals with arrays and lists
 heavygabriel: this is where I program 99% of my stuff
 eulerscheZahl: ok, here's my list task: given a double linked list, revert the order in linear time and constant additional memory
 heavygabriel: list.reverse?
 heavygabriel: idk
 heavygabriel: google it 
 heavygabriel: by "list god" I basically meant that most of the stuff I've spent researching are lists
 eulerscheZahl: sorry to tell you but you didn't nail it
 heavygabriel: and since I'm basically new
 heavygabriel: to programming
 heavygabriel: it's not misleading per se but more like not telling the full story
 heavygabriel: also the description of ascii art
 heavygabriel: "Do you feel you are an artist at heart? Unfortunately you are a programmer"
 heavygabriel: basically me when I'm doing sites
 heavygabriel: legit cannot make any sort of visually pleasing site
 heavygabriel: btw is it just me or are like 99% of puzzles are not very good-looking or looks like an actual game?
 eulerscheZahl: i share that weakness with you
 eulerscheZahl: puzzles look fine for me. it's not like you want to spend weeks looking at them. they are just to clarify what's going on
 eulerscheZahl: and some multiplayer games look really nice IMO
 heavygabriel: TBH I have made a site online to test WebAPIs
 wlesavo: euler dll cant have loops by definition? i mean in single pass each elment only encountered once?
 heavygabriel: wait what? MP games?
 eulerscheZahl: dll? the dynamically linked library?
 wlesavo: doubly linlked list :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 heavygabriel: double linkedin list
 heavygabriel: poggers
 eulerscheZahl: just a list, each element only once
 heavygabriel: dl? double linkedin
 wlesavo: hm, so its probably quite easy to reverse in linear time in two passes
 eulerscheZahl: but how do you do it with constant memory overhead then?
 eulerscheZahl: there is a way with only 1 pass
 eulerscheZahl: and heavygabriel is right: it can be googled
 heavygabriel: as I said before
 heavygabriel: rule 0 of programming: it IS searchable(except if it's like turbo pascal or something)
 eulerscheZahl: my first language
 eulerscheZahl: turbo pascal 7, with an IDE older than myself
 wlesavo: well two is still linear, by ill google the single one
 Astrobytes: Other than German&#160;;)
 heavygabriel: stop being old
 heavygabriel: eulerscheZahl are you my dad? you're like 40
 wlesavo: eulers first words was program wincrt
 eulerscheZahl: 28 to be more accurate
 heavygabriel: ok so you had turbopascal
 heavygabriel: in fucking 1992?
 eulerscheZahl: in school. old teacher
 Astrobytes: Everyone here is older than you heavygabriel
 heavygabriel: no shit
 Astrobytes: Apart from that other guy
 heavygabriel: rule -1(cannot use index below 0, but fuck off) I am younger than all of you
 wlesavo: also 28 and also had pascal in school actually :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: In highschool, my computing studies teacher didn't know anything about programming
 heavygabriel: me neither
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo = eulerscheZahl's 2nd account confirmed
 heavygabriel: my compooter teacher(we have a dedicated program for that) 
 eulerscheZahl: same Astrobytes, corrected my teacher a few times
 wlesavo: the question is should they ban main or alt account?
 Astrobytes: I'm 37 and the only 'programming' I did in school was in primary school, LOGO on a BBC microcomputer
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl my one literally didn't even teach any programming
 Astrobytes: Hardware only
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Astrobytes: Thankfully I was the inquisitive type and explored at home
 eulerscheZahl: the year after me did this as "programming"<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngndgqTAlwI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngndgqTAlwI</a>
 eulerscheZahl: sorry for German, just fast-forward to see some action on the screen
 Astrobytes: lol, seriously. Logo is better
 eulerscheZahl: i have a little experience with SPS programming in Simatic Manager.I guess it's very similar to Logo?
 wlesavo: Smitsimatic Manager :open_mouth:
 struct: Im 15 so not that hold
 struct: old*
 eulerscheZahl: not old but a liar
 struct: ouch
 eulerscheZahl: or you measure time in something else than years
 eulerscheZahl: Imperial years or such nonsense
 wlesavo: programming age
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)</a>
 struct: Im not sure I revealed my age before hmm
 Astrobytes: We used Acornsoft version
 Astrobytes: 20-something I reckon struct
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i assumed this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(SPS)">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(SPS)</a> - there isn't even an English version of this article
 struct: yeah 20 somthing
 wlesavo: even russian version, lol, also assumed it was some kind of programmed calculator
 Astrobytes: I wish we were doing stuff like that in school, fairly close in physics but no actual programming
 heavygabriel: I have no idea what you guys are talking about
 heavygabriel: the only school based "programming" language is scratch-like
 struct: stockfish 41-49-3 vs komodo in 12' 3<i> time control</i>
 heavygabriel: wow
 Astrobytes: I got warned off pursuing a computer based education by my biology teacher actually, he said "you'll learn all the programming you need for biology at uni"
 heavygabriel: so I google "scratch -like languages" and it gave me scratch alternativess
 tomatoes: D?
 heavygabriel: Astrobytes you know what's hard in HS with programming? actually learning programming
 eulerscheZahl: the first step is always the hardest
 eulerscheZahl: when you have some basic understanding, it gets easier
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: and when you know one language, it's easier to learn another one (except Haskell)
 heavygabriel: for me the hardest step is to start the step
 Astrobytes: Having a solid grasp of maths helps too, and logical thinking, problem solving
 heavygabriel: so it's a weird paradox where I cannot learn without learninfg
 heavygabriel: basically swirl pool-like thinking
 Astrobytes: Apply yourself and stop f'ing about.
 Astrobytes: (essentially :P )
 heavygabriel: TL;DR shut the fuck up :D
 heavygabriel: D
 heavygabriel: sD
 heavygabriel: xD
 heavygabriel: iD
 heavygabriel: 1 eyed man smiling
 Astrobytes: Focus is important. Don't distract yourself, be target-oriented. Don't spam rubbish.
 heavygabriel: iD
 eulerscheZahl: it's much easier to get into coding now than it was when we were at your age. tons of online tutorials
 Astrobytes: ^
 heavygabriel: yes that's what I see tbh
 heavygabriel: today instead of going through that 1k pages 1$ per page programming book to see what you want
 Astrobytes: I had code in magazines to learn from and sometimes examples on disk. Other than that, a manual.
 heavygabriel: you got stack
 heavygabriel: n shit
 heavygabriel: you don't even need to learn everything about the language
 heavygabriel: you can just copy paste relevant code
 Astrobytes: You should understand computer architecture at least at a reasonable level, how programs work in relation to the architecture etc
 heavygabriel: I mean IK what's computer hardware and how the CPU is the thingy that does everything for programming
 heavygabriel: for compilers n stuff
 Astrobytes: Learn about memory, how the processor... processes... it'll make life easier even if you never touch a systems language
 Astrobytes: Learn about languages and how they work, how they are interpreted or compiled
 heavygabriel: ik about like NOT XOR and NOR
 heavygabriel: logic gate stuff
 Astrobytes: Focus on one language to start with, after that, things will begin to click into place
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that's usually where you stop
 Astrobytes: But you have to apply yourself.
 eulerscheZahl: not going down to transistors and how they work
 Astrobytes: That's good fun too
 eulerscheZahl: had than in my Bachelor (studied Electrical Engineering)
 heavygabriel: Astrobytes it's hard to focus on 1 language if I'm simutaneously a fucking web developer and a command promptist
 heavygabriel: :P
 heavygabriel: but hey that's why I got 2 screens
 heavygabriel: to web dev n edit code
 heavygabriel: (lol)
 Astrobytes: Well choose your tools for web dev and choose your tools for otherwise and stick to them.
 eulerscheZahl: 2 screens are really helpful when creating UIs
 heavygabriel: especially in web dev when like you got no god-like programs to make interfaces like VS
 heavygabriel: the closest thing you can get is dreamweaver(shit even VSCODE base has more stuff than that)
 Astrobytes: All our EE-based stuff was done in physics classes in highschool, then  a little in 'tech studies', but there was nothing really dedicated
 heavygabriel: ee?
 Astrobytes: Electrical Engineering, was replying to euler
 heavygabriel: oh
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't get the EE either
 Astrobytes: ffs
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: was thinking of Java EE (enterprise edition)
 eulerscheZahl: or evil edition, as thedailywtf tells us
 Schwase: oh i feel so dumb i couldnt get 100 for so long in 1d spreadsheet because i was using substring to eliminate the "$" symbol when it was used as a reference and i did substring(1,2) instead of substring(1) and made a loop&#160;:||||||
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/The_Call_of_Codethulhu">https://thedailywtf.com/articles/The_Call_of_Codethulhu</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know it
 heavygabriel: wow so like a CPU is like the GET http protocol
 heavygabriel: (minus the internet part)
 eulerscheZahl: it has a query string?
 eulerscheZahl: whatever, i'm off. good night
 Schwase: eulerscheZahl gn
 Astrobytes: lol night eulerscheZahl
 Schwase: nice talking to you
 heavygabriel: are there any uses for asynchronous code besides fetching web stuff? 
 tomatoes: all io
 heavygabriel: oh yeah I forgot about I/O
 jacek: and multithreading
 heavygabriel: tbh I should try multithreading when I'll get good with the basics
 heavygabriel: I cannot comprehend algorithms, even less make one
 tomatoes: pencil and paper
 heavygabriel: yeah but shouldn't understand the basics first should help?
 Astrobytes: It's just a set of instructions to accomplish a task.
 Astrobytes: In the simplest terms, think about making a sandwich. Write down all the steps you need to take. Boom. Sandwich algorithm
 heavygabriel: what
 heavygabriel: so a method=algorithm?
 Astrobytes: Of course it gets harder than that, and it's a simplification, but it's really just a set of rules to solve a particular problem
 HelloWorld183L: a method can contain an algorithm but I don't think saying method = algorithm is exactly right or captures the full meaning of a method
 Astrobytes: You'll see a lot of notation that describes algorithms, that may be confusing at first
 heavygabriel: "set of rules to solve a particular problem" I don'T think I have written one
 HelloWorld183L: more a "set of instructions" than "set of rules"
 Astrobytes: Yes, context dependent of course
 AhmedMasry: hello
 AhmedMasry: how is the site calculate the shortest code it's obviuos that python will always be the lowest  =D 
 Astrobytes: No. Sometimes ruby, or perl, and bash
 AhmedMasry: can I win using c++  does it depends on charcters or what  ? 
 jacek: its characters only
 jacek: so no handicap for c++
 Astrobytes: Yes, characters. Don't try shortest with C++ or any other verbose lang&#160;:)
 heavygabriel: send help 
 AhmedMasry: it's not fair :joy:
 heavygabriel: there are no methods in a c# list that you can use to destroy and insert
 heavygabriel: i should try to optimise a "big" project that I have in C# tbh
 struct: It's fair
 struct: You can also choose ruby
 heavygabriel: wow
 heavygabriel: nvm it wasn't directed at me
 struct: So a guy is playing 4 clashes at once
 struct: completes them all
 struct: not suspicious
 Astrobytes: seems legit
 struct: yeah top 3
 Astrobytes: How do you know he's doing 3 at once?
 struct: Because I left them all
 Astrobytes: *4 sorry
 struct: and he insta joined the next
 struct: And then I checked and he completed all
 struct: while he was in the other
 struct: All were playing and he still did not submit
 Astrobytes: Hmmm
 struct: These are not 1 minute clashes btw
 Astrobytes: But he's insta-solving and its not a CG bot
 Astrobytes: Who is it?
 struct: DiL
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, seen him post here
 Astrobytes: He might just be copy pasting his solutions
 DiL: I join multiple clashes at once to find the ones I like the most
 struct: yet you completye all?
 struct: makes no sense
 DiL: nope, in some I loose
 evilnose: lnose
 RocketRidah: of couse you nose. you're evil.
 Astrobytes: Oi RocketRidah, always RTFM! Solved right?
 Astrobytes: (temperatures puzzle that is)
 RocketRidah: Indeed! I was tired and missed that whole sentence&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: It happens&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Screen breaks ftw
 Zenoscave: Did they resub tmeps golf again?
 Zenoscave: temps*
 Michelangela: Is there a way to compete using the same programming language? Because the winning criteria is not fair e.g. between Python and C# to judge by code length
 Zenoscave: No. But it is a site that is intended to motivate you to learn new languages. so perhaps learning a new language is a better solution
 ryantimjohn: Yeah, the best code golfers will have a lot of languages in their back pocket to be like... ruby has a one line, 80 char solution to this
 FunckyFizz: Any of yous worked out how to get your buggy always actually moving towards the next checkpoint rather than skidding arround (i.e. steaking into the skid)?
 FunckyFizz: *stearing
 Schwase: in the podracing game? @ FunckyFizz
 LelouchVC2: Learn a new language in order to win shortest mode which requires you to destroy the readability and reliability of your code&#160;;)
 LelouchVC2: Sounds like a good way to destroy good programming practices rather than enforce them onto coders learning a new language
 Schwase: goal oriented learning should be oriented towards applicable skills, not how to win code golf
 Schwase: thats all im saying
 Hannnn: hows everyone doing
 Hannnn: feeling good?
 No_one...: yeah 
 Schwase: heck yeah

 LelouchVC2: What a strange concept 
 Schwase: sarcasm im hoping?
 LelouchVC2: The world may never know

 LelouchVC2: We can joke about 9/11, but too soon to joke about black lives
 Schwase: um
 Schwase: i did not ok 9/11 jokes...

 Schwase: while(B.indexOf("f")!=-1){
 Schwase: line 37 is the B=... statement
 Schwase: idek how this is possible
 tomatoes: f is last or before last
 Schwase: i figured it out now
 Schwase: and yes
 Schwase: youre correct
 Schwase: i made a catch for last
 Schwase: but didnt for before last
 Schwase: because i didnt compensate for the length 3 segment
 Schwase: thanks still

 Astrobytes: Spamming gets you kicked
 kristoffer888: who is spamming?
 K2ARISM: we are just talking tho
 Astrobytes: Keep it on topic, don't flood the chat with rubbish

 K2ARISM: :innocent:i will be an angel now sir
 Astrobytes: Just be good and we'll all have a nice day
 Maxim251: I am now in game 1D spreadsheet and there I have question, if there is operation VALUE is posible that arg1 will have char '_'&#160;? or always will be a number&#160;?
 Maxim251: and how interpret char '_' ass 0 or write if statement to not include second value&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Maxim251 I haven't done that one but it looks like it could be from the statement
 kristoffer888: @astrobytes do you like dogs?
 kristoffer888: or cats?
 Astrobytes: Both.
 Maxim251: thanks.
 kristoffer888: np
 Astrobytes: kristoffer888 don't you have anything better to do?
 Maxim251: Now i figureout that... VALUE arg1 arg2: The cell's value is arg1, (arg2 is not used and will be "_" to aid parsing).it means that arg1 will be used as answare, but arg2 = '_' is only for passing cin &gt;&gt; arg2 to finish whole string. without that string from next line will go to previouse and everything will become messy.
 Astrobytes: Yes, however the statement "arg1 and arg2 are either a number ("-?[0-9]+"), a reference ("\$[0-9]+") or nothing "_". " makes this ambiguous
 MichailIvanov: pepega
 Maxim251: yes, because arg1 and arg2 are strings. 
 Maxim251: later i need convert them in to numbers
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid&#160;?
 Maxim251: I am only struggling how write if statements to distinguish between reference and value.
 Astrobytes: you have to check for a "$" for a reference right?
 Maxim251: I know, this is so simple, but maybe to simple, :persevere:
 Astrobytes: Does your language have a find character or find substring method?
 Maxim251: yes $ ass reference, and I know how substring them. I think the answer from previous operation I will need use with arrays
 Maxim251: Yes, is C++. 
 Maxim251: like arg1[5] = "$1" num = arg1.find("$")val = arg1[5].substr(num + 1)
 Maxim251: int v = stof(val)
 Maxim251: numArg[5] = answare[1] // answare from 1 line will be used ass numerical value in actual line to calculate
 Maxim251: it means that answare I should have ass array to memorise all values? 
 Maxim251: saying values i mean answers
 Maxim251: What is wrong with that&#160;?
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/97da5b6d-24c9-4cf0-8d6b-f67e148b2e94">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/97da5b6d-24c9-4cf0-8d6b-f67e148b2e94</a>
 Maxim251: it gives me answere 48, but i should have 3
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fcb1dd6-711b-442e-ab42-b58020ffb87f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fcb1dd6-711b-442e-ab42-b58020ffb87f</a>
 Maxim251: this is whole code, i use cerr to track that error, and untill numarg1[1] = answare[1]; looks good, after passing to numarg1[1] number become 48.
 Maxim251: and 48 anything what i can think of, could be keyboard characketr number :unamused:
 Maxim251:&#160;!! YES :grinning: I know where i make mistake, I use string answare and float answare[N] beliving that there are 2 diferent arguments.
 Maxim251: thats why I get 48 ,

 Maxim251: F* YEAH, I get it. 4 if statments and one switch case
 Maxim251: Oh no, Backward depencyy.. They mast me kidding. How I can do backward depency if value is on line 1 and I need compute it at line 0

 Xedux: :joy:
 Astrobytes: You can still ask if anyone wants to clash in this chat though
 Xedux: @jhon404
 professional_dumbass: ah
 professional_dumbass: these people who use ruby always beat us
 Astrobytes: Get learning ruby then&#160;;)
 ErebosTheos: Ruby or JS for fast problem solving??
 jacek: fast?
 ErebosTheos: i mean learning the basics?
 Astrobytes: Whichever you feel most comfortable with
 ErebosTheos: Python :joy:
 Astrobytes: Use python then!
 professional_dumbass: but code golf is the problem
 professional_dumbass:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: look up some tips for golfing in your language
 Astrobytes: on stackoverflow or something
 jacek: should i search for polish tutorial of golf?
 Zenoscave: jacek you troll lol
 Hjax: good morning
 Zenoscave: morning hjax
 Zenoscave: I'm ~4200 CP away from first in my country in overall ranking
 Zenoscave: I'm so close
 Zenoscave: wait... something changed. I am first
 Hjax: siharde vanished
 Hjax: strange
 Zenoscave: He's still there just different country
 Hjax: oh he changed his country to Morocco 
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: well, congrats :D 
 Hjax: currently it appears im #13 USA, you have like 2.5x my CP count
 Zenoscave: thanks!
 Zenoscave: You'll catch up&#160;;) I'm not anything but diligent
 Hjax: need more unofficial contests to motivate me to play multis 
 Hjax: im doing pretty well in kutulu right now i think 
 Zenoscave: you're first in change of rank
 Hjax: yeah, went from no submission to rank 100 over the weekend, pretty solid start
 Zenoscave: you're well ahead of me even&#160;;) (not hard though i'm awful at Kutulu)
 Hjax: :P
 TheSilent_Boy: Hey!
 Hjax: hello
 TheSilent_Boy: hi
 uvBoss: @Hjax do u simulate?
 Hjax: nope
 uvBoss: no?
 uvBoss: damn
 uvBoss: heuristics?
 Hjax: yeah
 uvBoss: i cant get out of silver with just that
 uvBoss: :sob:
 kasudy: lol
 kasudy: can you give me some tips?
 kasudy: im stuck at wood
 uvBoss: for wood i just had a scoring system for all the squares in the map
 Hjax: i just score all of my legal moves, and pick the one with the highest score
 Hjax: and then i hard coded some logic for light and plan 
 Hjax: i dont use yell yet 
 Hjax: and i dont use shelters yet
 uvBoss: hjax ur and mine sounds so same
 uvBoss: but so different
 uvBoss: xD
 kasudy: tips for using light and plan?
 kasudy: i skipped the tutorial and now i regret it
 uvBoss: use light when sitting idle
 uvBoss: and plan whenu running out of sanity
 uvBoss: thats what i do
 Hjax: i use light when theres a wanderer thats roughly the same distance from me and someone else
 Hjax: to convince it to go after the other person 
 uvBoss: oh damn n1
 kasudy: i made a scoring algo using bfs
 Hjax: i plan when i have less than 200 sanity, theres at least one explorer nearby, and theres no wanderers about to attack me 
 kasudy: ive been using just that 
 kasudy: how does plan work?
 Hjax: you gain sanity for each explorer nearby 
 Hjax: and give them some sanity 
 uvBoss: im resetting everything and tryin to use SIMULATION
 Hjax: i might write a sim eventually 
 Hjax: i think i can get legend without one though
 Hjax: losing a game because you made the wrong guess at a crossroads is unfortunate 
 Nerchio: Hjax you got the top so fast&#160;:) nice
 Hjax: ty&#160;:)
 Hjax: i think i got a little lucky, a lot of my ideas worked, also blasterpoard gave me some tips
 Hjax: my bot is just heuristics right now, no search or simulation 
 uvBoss: no GA too right??
 Hjax: nothing like that
 uvBoss: so u adjusted the weights yourself?
 Hjax: yep!
 uvBoss: nice
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487008890">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487008890</a>-.- Frame 35 wtf are my dude doing 
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Need to update my GetFriends eval
 blasterpoard: thx for the boost Illedan
 Illedan: Np
 Illedan: Gimme a sec and I'll go above
 blasterpoard: honestly, it's about time
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: I am just trying some small changes
 blasterpoard: didn't you go me above before?
 Illedan: shouldn't be much needed
 Illedan: sure
 blasterpoard: I think someone even pushed euler above me for a while
 Illedan: The randomness is strong with teamwork..
 Illedan: "teamwork"
 Hjax: my bot ends up alone too much
 Hjax: basically all of my losses are because i was alone for too long 
 Illedan: I guess it needs to talk to someone?
 blasterpoard: my bot always ends up alone too... because everyone else is dead
 Hjax: must be nice
 Hjax: :P
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: euler times out too :thinking:
 Nerchio: first turn is 1000ms and i timed out wtf :d
 Hjax: are you sure you didnt crash
 Hjax: crashes appear as timeouts in viewer 
 Nerchio: nah im calculating the distance from every square to every square xd
 blasterpoard: I do that too
 blasterpoard: takem about 6ms
 blasterpoard: *takes
 Nerchio: on big map rip
 Scarfield: yea, forgot to take visited cells into account in my BFS at first, did time out
 Hjax: takes me about 100 ms to BFS everything 
 Nerchio: yea i do it inefficiently :D
 Hjax: my bot seems to lose any game where its 3 on 1, because its not willing to join the 3 because they tend to be surrounded by monsters
 Nerchio: Hjax how long is your distance calculation on this seed
 Nerchio: seed=2016281719346875900
 Nerchio: Distance map time: 587.221015 ms
 Nerchio: xD
 Nerchio: im confused why it takes so long
 Nerchio: but whatever i guess im just in time now
 Scarfield: when you have calculated the distance from the first cell to the rest, do you calculate the distance from the next cell to the first .. and so on? might be worth it not to, but idk
 Hjax: i dont, but yes that can divide your time in half
 kasudy: Hjax can you give me some tips to implement scoring algorithim?
 Nerchio: if i calculate from A to B i dont calculate from B to A
 Nerchio: still 600ms :D
 Nerchio: and how do you store the information?
 Nerchio: i use Map&lt;integer, 2Darray&gt;
 kasudy: ya mee too
 kasudy: are you coding in C++?
 Nerchio: nah java
 kasudy: oh
 Nerchio: but Hjax also is Java i think
 Nerchio: and he has 4x faster calculation :D
 blasterpoard: what algorithm are you using to calculate distances?
 Nerchio: bfs
 blasterpoard: from every square, I suppose... weird
 blasterpoard: because that's much faster for me
 Nerchio: yea idk maybe i did something bad in bfs or map creation :P
 AllYourPawns: what game are you guys talking about?
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/code-of-kutulu">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/code-of-kutulu</a>
 Scarfield: currently an unofficial contest
 kasudy: ive been using abismal python code.
 kasudy: im not even using deque,
 kasudy: and somehow its still working XD
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487021079">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487021079</a>
 uvBoss: my bot tryna scare the wwanderersoff
 uvBoss: xD
 kasudy: lol 
 Nerchio: idk you really need to feel this game to do well
 Nerchio: like i will advance to silver soon but im looking at the board and not sure what are the best moves xD
 Hjax: thats why i think i got lucky 
 Hjax: i guessed some heuristics and it turns out they were good 
 Moctrof: I hate kululu
 Moctrof: because I suck
 Hjax: i need to add yelling and shelters 
 Hjax: but im not sure those two alone will be enough for legend 
 Nerchio: most of the games shelters dont come in play i think xD
 Hjax: yeah they arent super impactful, and i think if you go to one alone its not super good 
 Hjax: if you bring a buddy they are good
 Nerchio: yea
 uvBoss: nerchio do u use simulation??
 Nerchio: no im in bronze
 uvBoss: oh oke
 uvBoss: climb up then
 uvBoss: xD
 Nerchio: hehe
 Hjax: i added voronoi calculations to my bot, i dont know how much they helped
 Hjax: so now it tries to maximize the number of squares it can go to before a wanderer 
 uvBoss: never heard of that before XD
 uvBoss: kk
 uvBoss: xD
 Scarfield: if you know BFS its simple enough, and very useful 
 Hjax: i will probably end up doing a search eventually 
 Scarfield: i already started making a sim, got bronze in first submit, and since all the rules are available i figured why not
 Scarfield: not sure what search to use yet though
 jacek: jacekmax
 Scarfield: MLPS
 Hjax: my search will probably be something like dijkstras algo 
 Hjax: with a cost function that takes into account the output from a sim
 Hjax: because really you want to find the path of minimum cost 
 Hjax: cost being sanity and some heuristic of how good your end position is 
 uvBoss: im oding the same
 uvBoss: doing*
 uvBoss: but got shit ton of bugs
 uvBoss: it always thinks waiting is the best move
 Hjax: lol
 Scarfield: xD
 uvBoss: i havenot implemented the end position heuristic but with just the sanity as cost it should be tryna avoid the enemy right?
 Hjax: sounds right yeah 
 jacek: wtf? why im dead suddenly? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/487025213">https://www.codingame.com/replay/487025213</a>
 Hjax: you timed out or crashed
 jacek: oh right
 uvBoss: next on murder mystery&#160;:jacek bot dies suddenly
 uvBoss: XD
 jacek: oh, a typo
 Hjax: bots seem to be largely deterministic, which is nice 
 Moctrof: Anybody tried to use the referee to do simulations&#160;? That's the only idea I would be excited about 
 Hjax: it wouldnt be that hard to implement the same logic as the ref yourself 
 Hjax: all of the logic is well documented in the problem statement 
 Scarfield: havent looked at the referee, just doing what he said ^
 Moctrof: really&#160;? Seemed to hard to try, I have never done A*
 Moctrof: And there is a lot of rules
 Scarfield: you dont need A*, just BFS
 Moctrof: Will it find the same path&#160;?
 Moctrof: Because they use A*
 Scarfield: yea, i never used A* but from what i have heard its only faster at finding the shortest path in very large maps
 Moctrof: Humm ok , so you have a simulation that work&#160;?
 Scarfield: not yet, working on it
 jacek: so how can you say its easy
 Moctrof: Good luck, seems hard
 Scarfield: never said it was, but from experience its easier for me to just implement the rules, rather than reading and translating a referee
 Moctrof: I was thinking of using Java just to avoid that ahah

 jacek: oh my
 Scarfield: but ty, u2 btw&#160;:)
 uvBoss: what anarchy is this?
 uvBoss: i have a question
 uvBoss: in a given frame
 uvBoss: is the info showm what i did to get here or what im tryna do now
 uvBoss: my bot seems to b eon frame slower?
 uvBoss: my goodness typos
 uvBoss: my bot seems to be one frame slower
 Scarfield: you can see your output, you are propably following more than leading?
 Scarfield: if you waited or moved i mean by your output
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/487024744">https://www.codingame.com/replay/487024744</a>
 uvBoss: aghhhhhhh
 Hjax: testing against three of the boss isnt a good idea imo
 Hjax: test against the boss, rank 1, and rank 2 
 uvBoss: no but its stupid af  rn
 Hjax: its really hard to beat 3 of the same bot, because they will do the same thing
 Hjax: and your bot will do something different and lose 
 uvBoss: its not even running away u know
 Scarfield: yea frame 17 in your replay hurts to watch :p
 Moctrof: But you are silver
 uvBoss: its like i guess dying is the best choice
 Scarfield: maximizing sanity loss ftw
 Moctrof: ahah
 uvBoss: i am making a new bot 
 uvBoss: @Moctrof
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487028189">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487028189</a>@Scarfield this would be maximising sanity loss
 uvBoss: btw i ahvenot yet included slashers
 Scarfield: hahaha oh dear XD
 Scarfield: that works well at least 
 uvBoss: it seems to know the worst moves
 uvBoss: but not the best
 Scarfield: xD
 Moctrof: Do the reverse 
 Moctrof: if it's left do right
 Moctrof: etc..
 uvBoss: xDlet me try that
 Moctrof: Legend guaranteed
 uvBoss: if it works
 uvBoss: .............
 Moctrof: new algorithm created the not Worst Search
 uvBoss: does not work coz of damn walls
 Moctrof:&#160;:(
 uvBoss: but survived longer than my "bestmove"
 Moctrof: I was so looking forward to see something magic
 Moctrof: lol
 DaIsNum: walls shall break
 uvBoss:  they should add hammers
 DaIsNum: or daya.
 uvBoss: hammer  wall 0,0
 DaIsNum: new explorer = daya
 uvBoss: but hammer wouldbe mor euseful to hit the enemies i suppose
 DaIsNum: ya could be
 DaIsNum: Erebostheos here
 Moctrof: We should do this game in group of 4 and the goal is that one of us survive the longest
 Moctrof: And you would be the tank
 uvBoss: xD
 uvBoss: my bronze bot was so good
 uvBoss: it came silver 1st
 uvBoss: but could not beat the boss
 Moctrof: :0
 Moctrof: Just wait
 Moctrof: I was like 5th in wood 3, next day after sleep I was in bronze
 Moctrof: There is not a lot of guys in wod 1 and 2 
 Moctrof: You are motivating me, I will try the java simulation with referee
 Hjax: i think ill try to get legend before writing a search
 jacek: or delete account
 Fosfen: Hello&#160;! Is there someone here who did Mars Lander (lvl 2 and 3) with an GA and could help me plz&#160;? Thanks&#160;!
 Moctrof: Yes
 Moctrof: But I did it just partially with GA
 Moctrof: I add some heuristics
 kasudy: finally got out of wood!!
 kasudy: almost but not sure 
 Bassel: hello
 jacek: someone uses yell yet?
 Hjax: is that a bell cranel profile picture? @Bassel
 eulerscheZahl: YES!!!
 Hjax: i dont use yell yet 
 NOTsteve: is anyone else here just garbage at coding still:upside_down:
 Bassel: Yeah
 Hjax: identifying peoples anime profile pics is fun
 Bassel: ikr&#160;:')
 Bassel: Sometimes, I use Rem from Re:Zero or Araragi from Monogatari
 Hjax: :thumbsup: for Rem
 Hjax: i found someone recently who had a Shintaro Kisaragi profile picture, kind of surprised me 
 Hjax: character from a somewhat unpopular show that i like 
 derjack: huh
 Hjax: it was this user <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/92fe27c87638ed608b14009eae3b68885371123">https://www.codingame.com/profile/92fe27c87638ed608b14009eae3b68885371123</a>
 Hjax: he also has a my hero academia banner
 Bassel: I watched an amv about this anime
 kasudy: damn bronze is a challenge
 Bassel: Few years ago
 Hjax: Mekakucity Actors?
 Bassel: Ye
 derjack: eeyup
 Hjax: it was a series of songs before it was an anime or manga
 Hjax: so you probably saw one of them
 Bassel: It was mostly him throughout the video 
 Hjax: probably Losstime Memory
 Hjax: thats one of his character songs
 Hjax: the series has a song or two for each character, and a bunch of story stongs 
 Hjax: songs*

 Nerchio: everybody just goes and groups up and leaves me alone :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's bullying
 eulerscheZahl: in hindsight the map design isn't optimal here
 Moctrof: lol
 eulerscheZahl: as the starting points are too far from each other
 Hjax: i lose every time i get bottom left on that map 
 Hjax: for some reason everyone goes to the top right
 jacek: random bias?
 Hjax: the list of explorers should be given in a random order /s
 jacek: how about swap rule
 Moctrof: someon knows a command to make good indentations and shit in the codinggame ide&#160;?
 Hjax: i dont use the codingame ide
 Hjax: i just copy paste from my preferred ide
 Moctrof: Clever
 kasudy: right click and format
 jacek: alt+f4
 Moctrof: thanks
 Moctrof: thanks&#160;!
 Moctrof: I am not here anymore
 kasudy: XD
 kasudy: should i use plan insted of wait?
 Moctrof: yes
 Hjax: if theres other explorers nearby and you need sanity 
 Hjax: you only have a limited number of plans though
 kasudy: oh 
 kasudy: all of these variables are getting really hard to control
 Moctrof: I just copied the refere classes in one file and it's doing shit saying static class can only be declared if they are top level... Fuck Java
 eulerscheZahl: then remove the static modifier
 kasudy: XD
 eulerscheZahl: what classes are static?
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/487044634">https://www.codingame.com/replay/487044634</a>
 Hjax: ugh
 Moctrof: PathFinderResult only, but there are methods who are statics in not static classes and it's saying it's not valid
 Moctrof: can only be declared in static or toplevel class
 eulerscheZahl: in the end it's BFS anyways
 eulerscheZahl: despite saying A*
 Hjax: do top bots also just lose if everyone runs away from them at the start
 Hjax: i dont really see what i could have done 
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they would do a little better but still come in 4th
 eulerscheZahl: let me replace you by me :P

 Hjax: yeah you seem to just try to not draw aggro
 Hjax: and pray it works out 
 Moctrof: that's good

 eulerscheZahl: blaster even won that match
 AggYzz: hello guys
 AggYzz: :wave:
 Hjax: everyone split up for some reason 
 Hjax: which gave blaster a chance to  win 
 blasterpoard: I manipulate slashers to damage them
 blasterpoard: maybe that
 Moctrof: lol
 Moctrof: genius
 blasterpoard: see that I spawned the slasher on the long path
 Hjax: ah thats clever
 blasterpoard: then triggered it when they were on that path
 eulerscheZahl: and that's still not your best bot in the arena, is it?
 Hjax: he was saying he has a depth 1 search bot that is top 10 
 blasterpoard: I have some improvements
 Hjax: which gives me hope for my depth 1 search
 blasterpoard: and I removed one search that made it timeout without pragmas
 blasterpoard: because during the contest I didn't know about those
 blasterpoard: it resulsted in 55-60% winrate against my then-best bot
 Hjax: you do local testing for this? 
 Hjax: i was thinking local testing would be bad, because each explorer will make the same decisions 
 blasterpoard: I did a bit during the contest
 Hjax: was it worth it? 
 blasterpoard: probably no
 Hjax: maybe i go find some github bots and test locally against them 
 Hjax: then there would be a variety of decision making 
 eulerscheZahl: there is one strong bot on github
 blasterpoard: "strong"
 eulerscheZahl: top10, not blaster level strong
 blasterpoard: even my bot isn't strong
 blasterpoard: I believe I could reach 30 or even 31 rating on this leaderboard
 Hjax: do you people with search simulate the movements of the other explorers?
 Astrobytes: check the post mortems Hjax, quite a variety of approaches
 blasterpoard: I do, these simulated explorers would suspiciously similar to the current #3 bot, if they used voronoi
 Hjax: oh i completely forgot about post mortems 
 Hjax: thanks for reminding me astro
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 kasudy: whats post mortem?
 AllYourPawns: after death
 Hjax: people post on the forums what approach they used
 kasudy: ooh
 Hjax: my heuristics have been serving me well so far, but ill need a better approach soon 
 Doggednamed1: How do I make my own puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>the yellow create bottom
 eulerscheZahl: at the top right
 Hjax: oh code of kutulu was the original smitsimax game?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: yep
 Hjax: neat
 eulerscheZahl: with little recognition at that point
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: only after he ported it to CSB the hype started
 jacek: but this game isnt so hexy
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: you werent kidding about the post mortems astro
 Hjax: everyone did something different
 Astrobytes: Yeah, so many different approaches. Some interesting ones at that.
 AggYzz: pppoopoo
 Astrobytes: AggYzz really?
 AggYzz: yes
 Astrobytes: Talk sense laddie.
 AggYzz: i am
 Doggednamed1: How do you make a number guesser in the Go Langage?
 Doggednamed1: Language
 AggYzz: idk
 AggYzz: find a random module
 AggYzz: and boom
 Astrobytes: Doggednamed1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=number+guessing+golang">https://lmgtfy.com/?q=number+guessing+golang</a>
 Hjax: these post mortems are leaving me more confused than i started
 Hjax: no one agrees on anything lol
 Astrobytes: There's a lot of different ways to tackle the game
 Hjax: agade did an pessimistic minimax and got second, which sounds like it wouldnt be very good 
 Hjax: but somehow its good 
 AggYzz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bfy.tw/P3gN">https://bfy.tw/P3gN</a> 
 AggYzz: that is better than your link astrobytes
 AggYzz: ddg &gt; google
 Doggednamed1: I can't access those websites. They are blocked for some reason.
 AllYourPawns: ive heard of paranoid MCTS being good in multiplayer games
 Hjax: the weird thing is the game is collaborative 
 Astrobytes: just google (or insert your favourite search engine here) "number guessing golang" AggYzz
 Hjax: the assumption people are out to get you isnt very good 
 Nerchio: oh hey im in silver lol
 Hjax: because people will likely intentionally group up with you 
 AggYzz: Astrobytes i agree
 Astrobytes: Yet it works...
 Hjax: yeah, super surprising that it works 
 Hjax: cant argue with results lol 
 AllYourPawns: could also be he has an amazing eval function hah
 Astrobytes: sorry AggYzz, Doggednamed1, search for "number guessing golang"
 Astrobytes: He does AllYourPawns, read his PM
 AggYzz: dg
 Hjax: im always impressed by agades post mortems and results
 AllYourPawns: whats the link for post mortems again?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/code-of-kutulu-feedback-strategies/40543">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/code-of-kutulu-feedback-strategies/40543</a>
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:And for any other games just use the forum search and pick the 'feedback and strategies' threads
 Hjax: i might steal a few of R4N4R4M4s heuristics 
 Hjax: it will probably take me a while to decide which search i like 
 Hjax: honestly its probably best for me to run minimax against the best heuristic bot i can come up with 
 Hjax: because that seems sane to me at least 
 Hjax: im sure i would fail with agades approach
 Hjax: did Agade quit? ive read a lot of his post mortems and seen him on leaderboards, but i dont know if ive ever seen him in chat
 Astrobytes: Nah, he pops in now and then
 Hjax: i think if i ever see him in a contest im playing, i will be afraid :D 
 Astrobytes: I think squiddy said he's active on Kaggle too
 Hjax: are you going to work on your kutulu bot astro? 
 Astrobytes: Hopefully yeah 
 Astrobytes: Should have some time starting from tomorrow
 Astrobytes: Not as motivated since I was in gold already but Legend is a fair target!
 Hjax: i think i got lucky with my heuristic choices so far
 Hjax: maybe if i get lucky a couple more times ill be legend
 Hjax: are you planning to write a search? or just add more heuristics
 Astrobytes: Legend with heuristics is definitely possible, as you know from PMs.I donno whether to try to improve my existing (messy, was my 2nd contest other than the Thales semi-private one) or write a search-based one
 Astrobytes: Either way, it could really do with a rewrite lol
 Hjax: robostacs post mortem made me laugh "i had basically no time to work on my bot" and "i finished 22nd"
 Hjax: i want his problems
 Astrobytes: hehehe, yeah, he's a beast lol
 Astrobytes: He really did do that quick. We had Thales overlapping with the start of Kutulu, then iirc he was away for the whole weekend
 Hjax: msmits should fix his bot
 Hjax: almost dead last in legend because its timing out all over the place
 Astrobytes: Does he know it didn't survive the C# update?
 Hjax: dunno
 Hjax: is that what broke it? 
 Astrobytes: Think so, either that the weird timeout/timing issue with CG these days 
 Astrobytes: He's painting his new house so guess he's kinda busy atm
 Hjax: also i have to admire Wala's enthusiasm for these unofficial contests 
 Astrobytes: how so? 
 Hjax: he won the last one, and i see him submitting lots to this one 
 Astrobytes: Ah ok, I've not been keeping tabs on the LB
 Astrobytes: alright, I'm out for tonight. gl Hjax&#160;:)
 Hjax: cya
 Nerchio: this game is more random than pacman :D
 AnyaA:&#160;??? what game
 AnyaA: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/487099270">https://www.codingame.com/replay/487099270</a>How can I do better??? SOmeone help
 Elsa_Polindo: chupenme el pico
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: anyone playing this game rn or just bots?
 AnyaA: what game?
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: clash of code
 AnyaA: oof
 AnyaA: i can join
 AnyaA: i joined
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: hey
 uvBoss: @anaya use linear algebra
 AnyaA:&#160;???
 uvBoss: instead of going towards the centre of yourtarget try and go towards where u can reach
 uvBoss: u can use your previous X and Y to get yourvelocity
 uvBoss: and use that to change your destination from the centre to towards your pod
 uvBoss: idk how clear this is.....
 AnyaA: oh ok
 AnyaA: uoi spel my name wrong
 uvBoss: xd sry
 AnyaA: np
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: hey
 AnyaA: hi
 AnyaA: why am i so trash?
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: i just guessed on that last one lol
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: idk why but n * (n-1) worked
 Enknable: n**2 - n / 2 is the sum of all numbers from 1-&gt;n
 AnyaA: I still need to learn sme things, so That is why i basically got stuck... I know advanced stuff but not easy

 Astrobytes: Hjax made some nice improvements in Othello I see
 Iuliep: how can i see the codingamers that are in my company/school?
 LelouchVC2: They see you
 LelouchVC2: You cant see them
 Iuliep:&#160;:(
 Iuliep: thanks for the answer
 Astrobytes: Iuliep, there's a dropdown in the leaderboard page to filter by company/school
 Astrobytes: At the top, says 'School/Company' with an arrow next to it, then click 'Same as Iuliep'
 Iuliep: thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 Smartasskilling: Anyone in chat that can help me with a for loop and removing an entity in python?
 FlyingPirate_a6de: Smartaskilling
 FlyingPirate_a6de: hello
 FlyingPirate_a6de: do you still alive&#160;?
 Smartasskilling: yeah
 FlyingPirate_a6de: yup,  I suggest to use list
 FlyingPirate_a6de: is it ok&#160;?
 FlyingPirate_a6de: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/what-ways-can-we-use-to-remove-elements-from-a-list-in-python/376298">https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/what-ways-can-we-use-to-remove-elements-from-a-list-in-python/376298</a>
 FlyingPirate_a6de: list = [1, 2, 3, 1]
 Smartasskilling: havn't finished  coding but I suspect an eroor in coding the way  I did
 FlyingPirate_a6de: can you share to me
 FlyingPirate_a6de: I want to play game a bit
 Smartasskilling: I'm using an array that uses integers for faster compiling vs lists
 Smartasskilling: I dont know how tomake a github, can you help me
 FlyingPirate_a6de: uhm, sorry I also quite new with all of these thing
 FlyingPirate_a6de: I just try to play and learn
 FlyingPirate_a6de:&#160;:)
 Smartasskilling: How can I share to you, if you know of a way to help me
 FlyingPirate_a6de: copy past directly to this place  ?
 Astrobytes: Paste your code here
 FlyingPirate_a6de: is it possible&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It will pastebin automatically
 Smartasskilling: oh ok lol
 Smartasskilling: Basically it would be easier to explain
 Smartasskilling: I am running a for loop running for:
 Smartasskilling: for k in range[0,max+1]:
 Smartasskilling: Where max= array.pop()
 Astrobytes: Honestly just paste the whole thing, someone will be more able to help you. No one is gonna judge your code&#160;;)
 Smartasskilling: Then in the for loop with a if condition im doing array.remove(k)
 Smartasskilling: Ok then
 pardouin: for k in range[0,max+1]:
 pardouin: shouldnt that be&#160;:
 pardouin: for k in range(0,max+1):
 pardouin:&#160;?
 Smartasskilling: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/665d9485-80e4-45eb-b56f-4d886d252ee6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/665d9485-80e4-45eb-b56f-4d886d252ee6</a>
 FlyingPirate_a6de: seem you want to remove the last entity
 FlyingPirate_a6de: in a array
 Smartasskilling: not lastbut more current one while running itbut keep going trough array with increment of one with removed array entity
 Smartasskilling: Maybe I should just use an array and increase k by one except when I delete an entity
 Smartasskilling: Not array but while loop sry
 FlyingPirate_a6de: I'm checking python syntax&#160;:)
 pardouin: a = arr.array'L',([])
 FlyingPirate_a6de: I'm just back from long long break&#160;:)
 pardouin: should be:a = arr.array('L',[])
 Smartasskilling: Im on shadows of the knight ep 2 shits difficult
 Smartasskilling: thx pardouin accedently shut down and just tiped quickley. will scan for errors laterbut thxanyway lol
 pardouin: Yeah it's not an easy one, did it a few days ago
 pardouin: I got the triple jump achievment :D
 Smartasskilling: If your having trouble understanding the code ill explain, sry its a bit complicated
 FlyingPirate_a6de: sorry but I still not clear solution here
 Smartasskilling: I want to make two arrays where at the same positionin both arrays represent an (x,y) position
 Smartasskilling: Like array a is the x one and b the y one
 FlyingPirate_a6de: yup
 Smartasskilling: Where example a: (0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1...) and b:(0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2...)
 pardouin: you need a 2-dimensionnal array for that
 pardouin: oh ok
 pardouin: but why not using a 2-dim array&#160;?
 FlyingPirate_a6de: ok
 Smartasskilling: 2d would be more difficult to manage in terms of position
 FlyingPirate_a6de: design seperately like this
 Smartasskilling: So here you can delete an entitiy in both say in position k that is one cordinate
 FlyingPirate_a6de: will make thing more difficul
 FlyingPirate_a6de: 1 possition will be 1 element
 FlyingPirate_a6de: which content position&#160;: x, y value
 FlyingPirate_a6de: then you will have array of multiple points
 Smartasskilling: Butyou cant deletean entity in one pos for 2d
 Smartasskilling: My space is a bit wankey sorry
 FlyingPirate_a6de: if space is limitted we can shift element
 Smartasskilling: You can delete and make the array shorter in an 1d
 pardouin: deleting is the wrong way to go
 pardouin: remove is extremely slow
 Smartasskilling: No like my space button is wankey sorry lol
 pardouin: you shouldnt use array at all
 pardouin: just keep track of where you are with int
 Smartasskilling: I did try without arrays or lists but didnt get a solution
 pardouin: but it's the way to go
 pardouin: search the x then search the y
 pardouin: with basic dichotomy stuff
 pardouin: the hard part is what to choose for your next move
 Smartasskilling: I would like to view the position as 2 arrays of x and y elements where the pos of both reperesent the position so I only have an array of the availible field and the dicrease that
 Smartasskilling: Then for the next move I can view the availible field as an array and move to my current pos i array + half of array length
 pardouin: there's no really benefit in moving both x and y, it makes it extremely hard to figure out the area where the bomb can be
 Smartasskilling: Like area but not 2d with squire
 Smartasskilling: Ok so it might be wrong or not even be able to find the bomb but I would atleast try to figure out how to do it this way
 pardouin: and it's not more efficient, splitting your big matrix vertically or horizontally is not less efficient than splitting diagonally
 Smartasskilling: Willmy for loop fork if I remove an entity or should I dec k with one, will a for loop even allow me to do that anyway?
 Scarfield: Am trying to get visual studio to use GCC compiler to be able to profile my othello code. Am using builtin functions that are only part of GCC apparently. It seems MinGW is the way to go?
 Scarfield: This is something i basicly know nothing about, so just wondering if i am on the right track, seem to remember MinGW being mentioned here before
 Astrobytes: Scarprofile, hi
 Astrobytes: Use the VS instrinsics
 Scarfield: yo yo :vulcan:

 Smartasskilling: If not than thats also ok
 VictorThanhVo: @smartasskilling what code are you referring to? :D

 Smartasskilling: I'm trying to write a solution for the shadows of the knight ep 2. Im finished but it spazes out
 Scarfield: ah ty!&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No worries&#160;:)
 FlyingPirate_a6de: I try to run using for loop
 FlyingPirate_a6de: python 
 FlyingPirate_a6de: to delete 1 element in a range
 FlyingPirate_a6de: like this
 FlyingPirate_a6de: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39c4053d-6813-4814-8cc4-6ac5e80b7765">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39c4053d-6813-4814-8cc4-6ac5e80b7765</a>

 FlyingPirate_a6de: but I see it isn't good because for loop keep size of array not change
 FlyingPirate_a6de: then we will be access over limit of array of deleting 
 FlyingPirate_a6de: after
 FlyingPirate_a6de: maybe while loop will be better
 Smartasskilling: Im ying while now
 Smartasskilling: trying
 Smartasskilling: LOL just saw max was defined as len(a) * len(b) where max should be len(a)
 Smartasskilling: len doesnt work in array with python
 FlyingPirate_a6de: this one is working

 Scarfield: i havent looked at the batman 2, but round(1.5) will return 1. might be a problem(?).
 Smartasskilling: Cant seem to find my current position tho
 Smartasskilling: @Scarfield What do you mean?
 Scarfield: that the round function rounds down for numbers with x.5, i havent looked at the puzzle, but thought you maybe need to round up for that
 Smartasskilling: I'm willing to learn how to use github for help if you would flyingpirate
 Smartasskilling: I didnt know that, in some cases it would be wrong you rather want a larger field than miss the bomb. I'll look int round
 Smartasskilling: But rn round isnt the problem lol, i'll rather solve my search method first
 FlyingPirate_a6de: Smart I have to go for some task now. But if after 3 hours I will be back and see if any good news&#160;:)
 Smartasskilling: Lol for a bypass to round you could use (ans*2)%2
 FlyingPirate_a6de: else let continue learning
 Smartasskilling: Nah I'm not getting anywhere with the puzzle. Just fond one possible method with coding it but seem to struggle. Been taking coding with uni cause its part of my degree. Only half a year of beginner python tho.
 FlyingPirate_a6de: python is like that easy learn and forget
 FlyingPirate_a6de: just idea is still there
 pardouin: smartass what exactly do you want to do with these arrays&#160;?
 pardouin: and why not store couples directly in one array/set/any structure&#160;?
 Hjax: good morning
 Astrobytes: Hello, nice work dude
 Hjax: lol you saw my othello submit?
 Astrobytes: Yup
 Astrobytes: This is with the eval?
 Hjax: yeah this is EPT 
 Hjax: not even with a particularly good eval 
 Astrobytes: Nice. What depth?
 Hjax: 7 random moves before the eval
 Hjax: i didnt try the search variant yet, thats more code
 Hjax: this version was super easy to make, only took about half an hour 
 Astrobytes: Good stuff. How's the Rust version?
 Hjax: i wrote most of a search 
 Hjax: havent quite finished it / tested it though
 Hjax: its kind of weird to be passing around just indexes into the array
 sHlOk: Hi everyone!
 Astrobytes: Ah you'll get used to it
 Astrobytes: hi
 Hjax: also having to build my board up as i explore the tree is new 
 Hjax: maybe i should have prototyped it in java first 
 Hjax: it was almost annoying how much stronger adding EPT made it 
 Hjax: the eval is almost certainly terrible 
 Astrobytes: Hey, it works eh&#160;;)
 Hjax: its just mobility, bonus for corner squares and edges, penalty for the squares around corners 
 Hjax: can beat everyone below the fox
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it gets rather tough around that spot in the leaderboard lol
 Hjax: i feel a little bad for tomatoe s, my bot has destroyed his rating
 tomatoes: good
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: im not sure why my bot is so good against yours 
 Astrobytes: It can smell another MCTS :P
 tomatoes: maybe ept really good in this game
 Astrobytes: I think so
 Hjax: it definitely seems really good, theres a lot i can do to improve my eval 
 tomatoes: pure random rollouts are really bad
 tomatoes: biassed a bit better
 MSmits: thought so&#160;:)
 Hjax: ^ smits gets credit, i wouldnt have tried it if he hadnt mentioned it 
 MSmits: nah, give me credit when I pull it off myself. will be a while
 MSmits: maybe it's just a mediocre search type here and your genius made it work
 Hjax: lol, unlikely 
 MSmits: we'll see
 Hjax: do you usually wait until you have something you are pretty confident in before submitting? 
 MSmits: finally off work, so I hope to start on othello in a few days when i finish my owaRE STUFF
 MSmits: sry caps
 Astrobytes: He called you a genius Hjax, run with it :P
 MSmits: hjax no not really
 Hjax: i just hope it takes smits at least a few submits to pass me 
 MSmits: you will probably see me submit poor versions first
 Astrobytes: Yeah you always need to do a few runs 
 jacek: 1 submit 1 legend
 Hjax: oware is a somewhat neat looking game, just because its so simple looking on the surface 
 jacek: dont let it deceive you
 Astrobytes: ^
 Hjax: lol
 Davronbek: hi
 Davronbek: hello
 Davronbek: nima gap 
 Hjax: so all of the things im reading say potential mobility is a good heuristic 
 Hjax: but it seems like it just makes my bot worse 
 jacek: whats potential in this context/
 Hjax: number of enemy pieces that are next to an empty tile
 Hjax: which are moves that arent necessarily legal this turn, but might be legal in the future 
 jacek: ahh, frontiers?
 Hjax: yeah 
 jacek: its helpful, really
 Hjax: it sounds helpful 
 Hjax: but it doesnt seem to make my bot better 
 Scarfield: "might be legal in the future", if opponent has all pieces in the right side, so you cant capture any there, is your heristic still considering the left frontier as future legal moves? just a thought, not sure if its clear what i mean&#160;:)
 Hjax: yes, but its just a heuristic 
 Hjax: its not perfect
 struct: No true AIs yet
 struct: we must wait
 Hjax: struct how does it feel to see a java program gaining ranks on your othello leaderboard
 Scarfield: oof
 struct:&#160;:(
 Scarfield: isnt the mobility actually just the no. of legal moves, and not future possible legal moves? The less moves you have, the less "control"
 Hjax: a lot of papers recommend using both number of legal moves and number of frontier pieces in your eval
 Scarfield: ah okay
 struct: You can win with 1 piece
 struct: Not realistic, but its possible
 Scarfield: what kinda bot is the boss for othello btw?
 jacek: sometimes this heuristic fails <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475243308">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475243308</a>
 jacek: turn on legal moves
 struct: boss is mcts
 struct: See first image Scarfield
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.othellobelgium.be/leer-othello/tips-en-strategie">http://en.othellobelgium.be/leer-othello/tips-en-strategie</a>
 struct: white will always win
 struct: black*
 Scarfield: haha yea sure, but i only saw "The"jaw mention the future possible moves first, and not the current no. of moves as part of the heur
 Smartasskilling: How do you manipulate lists like you do for a string. Like strName[a:b] but in a list. Like listName[3]. I want the 3 to 5th character in one string in a list
 Smartasskilling: using python
 Hjax: you can slice lists the same way as strings 
 Scarfield: ^
 Smartasskilling: How for example do n save the third list entitys 3rd to 6th character
 Smartasskilling: Like  var = listName[???]???
 Scarfield: i think it makes a pointer to the original list, but im very rusty in python
 Hjax: listName[3][3:7]&#160;?
 jacek: or very pythonic in rust
 Hjax: im not entirely sure what you are asking 
 Smartasskilling: Yeah like that
 Smartasskilling: Just the format
 Smartasskilling: Thx
 Hjax: np
 Smartasskilling: Didnt know if it should be [3,3:7] or [3][3:7]
 Scarfield: if you want to use the n'th index of your sliced list it should be:listName[a:b][n] though (?)
 Scarfield: first you slice the original list, then choose the element in that slice
 Harshit_Gupta: Hello world! It is a very amazing platform! 
 Scarfield: :vulcan:
 Harshit_Gupta: :innocent: Finally, we programmers can have a two-way interaction, and not just our own print()! Loving it!
 jacek: woo new puzzle of the week
 Hjax: i dont calculate stable discs yet 
 Hjax: maybe that will be a big improvement 
 Hjax: the fox timed out in a test game, that counts as me winning right? 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Hjax: have no fear struct, i will finish rust this weekend 
 struct: No I was just doing golf temperatures
 struct: and got 93%&#160;:(
 struct: I cant seem to get below 48 in ruby
 jacek: in celsius?
 Hjax: the return 0 for no temperatures is so annoying 
 struct: well in some langauges you can just do +0
 Neozero: Hi, can someone help me&#160;? I don't understand why this code in C give 8 and 23 and not 8 and 8 as output&#160;?
 Neozero: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/BJNG6N5CI">https://www.onlinegdb.com/BJNG6N5CI</a>
 Neozero: This make no sens to me.
 RockyMullet: Neozero whats the context
 Astrobytes: Hey Rocky o/
 Astrobytes: tomatoes: nice submit!
 Hjax: hey no fair 
 tomatoes: :grinning:
 Hjax: well done 
 RockyMullet: oh its C, I though it was C++
 Hjax: what did you change? 
 RockyMullet: hey Astrobytes :wave:
 Neozero: Yes it's C
 Hjax: are you using EPT now tomatoes?
 Neozero: I want to make a linked list but with pointer to function in the linked list struct
 tomatoes: ept, eval with corners and frontiers
 Hjax: just corners and frontiers? 
 jacek: how early is ept, i see big jump in 'rollouts'
 Astrobytes: Nice
 Neozero: The output didn't make sense to me.
 tomatoes: 6 plies
 RockyMullet: firstNode is only set in linkedList_initFirstNodeKV
 RockyMullet: Neozero
 RockyMullet: your puhs function only have printf in it
 tomatoes: im not how big/small it should be
 tomatoes: not sure*
 Neozero: yes
 Neozero: but the thing I don't understand is why it print 23 and not 8.
 Neozero: I never set firstNode later.
 RockyMullet: Also, not sure if its diferent in C but
 RockyMullet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8b2e468-7c10-49cc-8edc-9624314a4866">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8b2e468-7c10-49cc-8edc-9624314a4866</a>
 RockyMullet: here you set a pointeur to the adress of a local variable
 RockyMullet: recepee for disaster
 Neozero: oh that's might be the cause actually.
 RockyMullet: the local variable is destroyed at end of your scope
 Neozero: Yes
 RockyMullet: therefore you point to garbage
 Neozero: and this garbage is replaced by 23
 RockyMullet: likely
 Neozero: ok I understand better I will try to correct
 Neozero: thanks for help.
 RockyMullet: np
 Neozero: How should I rewrite this part of the code&#160;?
 Neozero: oh with malloc of course
 RockyMullet: hum I dont know your intensions here, like not sure why you feel like using function pointers
 Astrobytes: yep
 RockyMullet: and yeah, if you want allocation
 RockyMullet: you could also have member variables
 Neozero: well to make a linked list but like that was a class. To learn some C mechanics in fact.
 Neozero: member variables&#160;?
 RockyMullet: hum
 RockyMullet: like a varaible in your struct/class
 RockyMullet: thats a "member"
 RockyMullet: like a local variable is a varaible you create in your functions
 RockyMullet: a "member variable" is part of your calss
 RockyMullet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fcb986a-f575-4cce-a013-e60f9ba56715">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fcb986a-f575-4cce-a013-e60f9ba56715</a>
 RockyMullet: key, value and next_node are member variables
 RockyMullet: so when you instanciate a "node" variable, it will autmaticly also allocate those member variables with it
 RockyMullet: so if something always need variable "potato" no point of making a pointer with an alloc
 RockyMullet: you cna juste have a "potato" variable
 RockyMullet: C &amp; C++ are pretty at letting you shoot yourself in the foot with memory management, so I generally try to avoid all dynamic allocation when possible
 Neozero: when I create a struct with member variable should I malloc them all&#160;?
 RockyMullet: no
 RockyMullet: you can see struct and class as a juste a "grouping" or variables
 Neozero: Yeah
 RockyMullet: so when you do lets say:node myCoolNode;
 RockyMullet: myCoolNode already have a key, value and next_node in it
 Neozero: okey
 Neozero: if the three are int
 Neozero: it's create (int + int + int) space&#160;?
 RockyMullet: so I'd keep the allocs for things you dont know you need or how many you need
 RockyMullet: Neozero yeah you got it
 RockyMullet: so in your exemple, when you create a new node
 RockyMullet: in your push
 RockyMullet: there you can alloc a new node and point to it with your "next_node" variable
 RockyMullet: cause you want them to link to each other
 RockyMullet: and you dohnt know how many ndes you have
 RockyMullet: nodes*
 Neozero: hmm not sure to understand this part
 Neozero: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1b13343a-00e5-4479-9e59-a042273eb1bc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1b13343a-00e5-4479-9e59-a042273eb1bc</a>
 Neozero: at the end of this function node is destroyed&#160;?
 Neozero: node n
 RockyMullet: yes
 RockyMullet: cause its a local variable in the function linkedList_initFirstNodeKV
 tomatoes: immediate eval without rollout has 100% win rate vs old version :thinking:
 Astrobytes: I suspected this might work
 Astrobytes: It's what we do in oware
 RockyMullet: let say you make a function:
 RockyMullet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a69e2a1a-b0c0-4923-8d54-fc147cf85b53">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a69e2a1a-b0c0-4923-8d54-fc147cf85b53</a>
 struct: Howe do this work?
 RockyMullet: the variable "temp" exist only for the time of the function
 RockyMullet: its a local variable, so once out of the scope of the function, this variable is destroyed
 RockyMullet: actually, my params are not reference or pointers, so this funciton doesnt do anything lol
 RockyMullet: since even my paramewters are local variables
 RockyMullet: better:
 RockyMullet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41d16d71-7205-400d-baea-7856f0fc2466">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41d16d71-7205-400d-baea-7856f0fc2466</a>
 struct: Astrobytes / tomatoes what do you mean by no rollouts?
 Neozero: I have done this
 Neozero: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8d844a70-4eab-4d0e-b7bc-06b4c0642d5b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8d844a70-4eab-4d0e-b7bc-06b4c0642d5b</a>
 RockyMullet: this is c++ tho, I didnt do C in like 15 years, so I forgot whats different lol
 Neozero: and this work 
 Neozero: ok
 RockyMullet: yeah
 tomatoes: just score node after selection and go for next
 RockyMullet: it will
 Astrobytes: yeah struct, what tomatoes said
 RockyMullet: just be sur to delete that memory once in your destructor
 Astrobytes: I'm sure me and Smits explained it before no?
 struct: So select expand backpropagate?
 Neozero: ok so in you second example you used reference&#160;?
 Astrobytes: select, expand, eval, backprop
 struct: So you eval the expanded Node?
 struct: or which one?
 Hjax: yeah you replace doing a rollout with just a heuristic eval 
 Neozero: I don't like reference just for the fact that it's kind of confusing where the intent was to make pointer less confusing&#160;:)
 jacek: instead of playout, you do eval
 struct: ah ok
 Neozero: RockyMullet 19H12just be sur to delete that memory once in your destructor
 Neozero: that's the tricky part, I should use free.
 Neozero: But it's not easy for a noob programmer like me&#160;;)
 Neozero: Anyway thanks u
 struct: So once you visit node again you select a children -&gt; expand -&gt; eval
 struct: Does the children score affect parent score?
 RockyMullet: yeah, just trying to help, memory leaks are not a problem in some languages with garbage collectors, C &amp; C++ leave that responsability to you
 RockyMullet: good luck&#160;:)
 Neozero: yes and that what make C and C++ performe very well&#160;:)
 dbdr: or languages with automatic free without GC, RockyMullet&#160;;)
 Neozero: dbdr GC is not an "automatic free"&#160;?
 dbdr: it is, but it's also possible without GC
 Neozero: what are language with automatic free but without GC&#160;?
 dbdr: rust
 RoboStac: modern c++ using smart pointers
 jacek: ;scream:
 Neozero: I was think that GC was an automatic free that keep track of "reference" to memory allocation.
 Neozero: Ok
 dbdr: that's correct
 dbdr: it's just not the only way
 Neozero: Ok and rust do it with another method&#160;?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.9.0/book/lifetimes.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.9.0/book/lifetimes.html</a>
 Neozero: dbdr is rust worth learning&#160;? I mean will I learn some new core concept with this language&#160;?
 dbdr: yes, it definitely has interesting concepts
 dbdr: I also heard people say once you know it, it would also help you writing cleaner C/C++ code
 dbdr: as it is in part inspired by the "best practices" needed in C++, but checked by the compiler
 Hjax: ive been learning rust, and im enjoying it 
 Hjax: still have a lot to learn 
 dbdr: did you finish your othello bot in rust?
 Hjax: not yet 
 Hjax: i wrote most of the search last night
 BigBadClown_b2a3: I might be stupid
 BigBadClown_b2a3: I spend 10% of my time solving and 90% screaming "WHY"
 tomatoes: js?
 Neozero: Ok I will check it out.
 jacek: here's my preliminary mcts w/ ept bot
 jacek: you can see how his eval jumping up and down
 Hjax: the bot you just submitted? 
 jacek: eeyup
 Hjax: so its weaker than your minimax?
 jacek: local testing indicates they comparable
 Hjax: are you doing any rollout? or just expand + heuristic 
 jacek: 2 plies random moves then eval
 jacek: eval from minimax bot
 jacek: i started to lose to weakers, but higher winrate against tric and some win vs dbd
 RockyMullet: yeah I know there are other concept that garbage collecting hehe
 RockyMullet: I mean, I do all my cg in C++ and work in C++ and almost never do dynamic allocation directly
 RockyMullet: there's just so many wrappers and containers that make it safer for you
 RockyMullet: but I like how Neozero approachs it, start at the root, to understand how it works first
 RockyMullet: seems like a good way to understand what you are doing
 dbdr: jacek: your bot seems to think black has a huge advantage?
 dbdr: looks like a bug to me
 jacek: thats racist
 dbdr: your bot is racist? :D
 RockyMullet: well black starts
 dbdr: sure, but do you think it wins 75%?
 dbdr: btw, isn't 6x6 solved as a win for white? or 4x4?
 Hjax: both are solved as wins for white 
 Astrobytes: Yes, as both
 Astrobytes: -as
 Hjax: its suspected that 8x8 is a draw 
 Hjax: although white has parity advantage (they get to move last if no one passes)
 Hjax: parallel opening is believed to be a win for black 
 BigBadClown_b2a3: what the fuck
 BigBadClown_b2a3: I'm doing a temperature problem, and it doesn't work with negatives
 BigBadClown_b2a3: but why would negatives matter when I use the absolute value?
 Hjax: what if theres -5 and 5
 BigBadClown_b2a3: not solving that part yet, just trying to get code that consistently works
 BigBadClown_b2a3: but yeah, now that I think about it since it doesn't differentiate between negatives that wouldn't work
 eulerscheZahl: where did that RockyMullet come from? :o
 jacek: i think canada
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jacek: ok time to switch back to the comfort zone
 Astrobytes: You don't wanna improve your EPT version?
 EvilClown_490c: Any way of getting a terminal on this thing. Would be really helpful (for Python 3)?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't feel comfortable in Canada?
 eulerscheZahl: "on this thing"can you elaborate?
 jacek: Astrobytes my eval is not mature yet
 Astrobytes: Ah I see
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl hi haha
 RockyMullet: I often play Othello, the actual physic one, with my gf and always wanted make an AI for it, since someone made a game on CG for it, half the work is done hehe
 RockyMullet: I'm still working on my data and part fo a small sim
 Astrobytes: Yeah Othello's a good game, on CG and irl
 Hjax: i didnt even know the rules before it got added to cg
 RockyMullet: also its canada day today, so I'm off work
 Astrobytes: Oh Canadaaaa, Happy Canada Day
 RockyMullet: :grinning::flag_ca:
 RockyMullet: thank you hey
 eulerscheZahl: you still have to visit CG occasionally to know about the port here
 RockyMullet: yeah cant remember what made me see it
 eulerscheZahl: nice to see you without a contest
 Astrobytes: Yeah I spotted when you submitted (last week?) but you'd gone offline by the time I saw 
 RockyMullet: my nxt objective is to make a decent offline debugger for next contest
 RockyMullet: I'll probably use some of the stuff you posted euler, to grab the input of a game
 eulerscheZahl: *insert advertising for the playground*
 RockyMullet: I totally failed in the end of pacman because I had no proper way of debugging my sim
 eulerscheZahl: you don't really need it on a full information game
 RockyMullet: Astrobytes I only submited a "always last" move bot
 Astrobytes: Ah I see
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl I'll probably test it on pacman actually
 RockyMullet: oh I think thats why I saw othello, was working on it for pacman
 eulerscheZahl: good candidate: fog of war but not too complex game logic
 RockyMullet: Astrobytes I'm working on an actual bot right now
 Astrobytes: Good. Watch out for that boss, it's badass
 eulerscheZahl: it's feasible
 RockyMullet: I'm going for what seems to be the obvious approach, minmax
 Astrobytes: People are having success with that yep, some MCTS variants too
 FunckyFizz: Is it possible to have a Python terminal on here?
 RockyMullet: I might "cheat a bit and hardcode a couple of first moves trying to go full dept offline
 dbdr: FunckyFizz: no
 eulerscheZahl: go to tech.io
 eulerscheZahl: or ideone
 dbdr: RockyMullet: wouldn't full depth be solving the game?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Oh btw dbdr, is it regular probcut or multi probcut you use?
 dbdr: multi
 Astrobytes: Nice. Seems appropriate.
 RockyMullet: dbdr yeah well, this game seems "finite"
 dbdr: chess is finite too
 RockyMullet: yeah
 RockyMullet: it seems simpler that chess tho
 RockyMullet: I'm just in theory land rn :D
 dbdr: it is. but people have been searching on it for years and not solving othello
 RockyMullet: really&#160;?
 RockyMullet: oh well
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Othello#Othello_8_x_8">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Othello#Othello_8_x_8</a>
 RockyMullet: I guess I wont go smash my facxe into that wall then :D
 jacek: maybe they werent on CG yet
 RockyMullet: 10^28
 RockyMullet: okay
 RockyMullet: I'll forget that idea haha
 struct: Yeah its above checkers
 RockyMullet: hey struct
 RockyMullet: thanks for the game&#160;:)
 struct: hi
 struct: np
 jacek: everyone is talking about it for past week
 RockyMullet: ok I win against my old bot who only  ouput the last possible move haha
 RockyMullet: progress
 Astrobytes: Everyone jacek? 
 Hjax: 32 straight losses to jacek
 Hjax: can i have one win please?
 RockyMullet: I might rank worse tho
 struct: wow you, are starting to get some wins vs dbdrt
 RockyMullet: my new bot just goes for whatever gives the most point rn, which often lead to a an early advantage, totally destroyed by huge lost in the end
 jacek: most pieces?
 RockyMullet: but at least my sim works
 RockyMullet: yeah most piece with a bit of heuristic in the mix
 jacek: what ive done works, but i dont know why
 RockyMullet: the best kind of code
 Hjax: are your heuristics top secret jacek
 Astrobytes: What have you done jacek?
 Hjax: hes trading games with dbdr now 
 Hjax: so he definitely made something better
 jacek: well im using typical heuristics + n tuples network
 RockyMullet: yup, my new bot ranked worse than my "always output alst possible move" bot lol
 RockyMullet: oh well
 Astrobytes: Oh you have it working now, cool
 Hjax: n tuples network?
 Astrobytes: Hjax <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.5111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.5111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
 jacek: trained by temporal difference + some self supervised learning
 Hjax: fancy, ill give that paper a read, thanks :D
 struct: 42% winrate, big improvement
 jacek: there is also usage for 2048, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf">http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf</a>
 jacek: yeah and i think i know im printing quite garbage eval to the msg now
 jacek: or not
 Hjax: so you just take some subset of the board, and use its state to index into an array of weights (one set of weights for each board subset), and you sum the scores accounting for symmetries 
 Hjax: with some fancy tuning for the weights 
 jacek: yes
 jacek: simples 'n-tuple' would be one square - like corners are good and next-to corners are bad
 jacek: but it doesnt take into account that if corner is taken by player, then player should likely put stone next to that corner
 jacek: with 4x1 or 2x2 tuples its more visible
 Hjax: that makes sense 
 Hjax: its like piece square tables, but in a way that can make positional judgements 
 Astrobytes: Pretty cool
 Hjax: how many self play games did you play to train it jacek
 jacek: several hundred thousands
 Hjax: wow thats a lot 
 Hjax: are the top bots here superhuman already? 
 struct: What do you mean by superhuman?
 struct: If they beat humans?
 Hjax: if they would beat the best humans 
 struct: I guess its hard to test
 Hjax: i ran my random rollout mcts against a human a few days ago and it got owned 
 jacek: just find online othello site and write bot for it and see
 Hjax: i was just entering moves by hand lol 
 Titimy: hey is there a way to see my history&#160;?
 struct: history of what?
 Astrobytes: Concentrate really hard, and try to remember your life
 Titimy: XD
 Titimy: history og my clashs
 Titimy: obviously
 struct: nah
 Titimy:&#160;:/
 struct: There is more stuff than clashes, so its not obvious
 struct: only if you see history on browser
 Titimy: oww sorry i'm new to the platform 
 struct: and check clashes reports
 Hjax: youll find most of the messages in chat are from people playing bot multis, not clash 
 struct: or you can press the bell near your name on top right
 Titimy: okay
 Ashraful: It was fun
 Ashraful: Has levels in codingame real values? I mean for jobs
 RockyMullet: no
 RockyMullet: mostly to gamify the platform
 Ashraful: Oh, ok
 Ashraful: Where can I see ranking?
 RockyMullet: but you can always try to brag about it
 RockyMullet: on a resume, the more "job related" you can brag about, the better
 RockyMullet: there are 2 things on CG
 Ashraful: What do you mean by "brag"?
 RockyMullet: levels that you get by gaining XP over time
 Astrobytes: "show off about it"
 RockyMullet: and rankings which is based on multiplayer games
 RockyMullet: like Astrobytes said hehe
 Ashraful: ok
 Ashraful: Isn't there global level ranking?
 struct: yes
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global</a>
 RockyMullet: the guy who showed me CG, was an ex colleague of mine and I know he bragued about being 2nd in canada on his resume
 kkkkkkl: Just 1 question
 kkkkkkl: how old are u guys
 Ashraful: I loved the site very much
 Astrobytes: Where is he at now RockyMullet?
 RockyMullet: still at my old job, im the one who left lol
 Ashraful: I am 13 from Bangladesh
 Astrobytes: I meant his ranking :P
 struct: I guess the person who was above him was rec urse
 Mal30: is there a way to avoid "short mode" in clashes?
 Mal30: they are dumb and boring
 Mal30: nothing creative about reducing code by characters
 SPDene: host your own clashes, so you get to choose the mode
 struct: or martin since he is old on this site
 RockyMullet: I think he is lead prog now
 Ashraful: I am completely new to CG. but I love this site much
 RockyMullet: struct it was before they changed on the ranking works
 struct: Mal30 reducing code is creative
 RockyMullet: when levels actually mattered in the rankings
 struct: ah
 Mal30: if you measure code by its simplicity, yes. But not by character count
 SPDene: use it as an opportunity to learn aspects of the language you didn't know, by looking at other people's code, @Mal30
 RockyMullet: he is actually 54th in canada now :P
 Astrobytes: lol, no longer CV-worthy
 RockyMullet: im 19th, damn you reCurse *shake fist in the air*
 struct: you are not 19th in canada
 RockyMullet: oh nvm
 struct: general leaderboard
 RockyMullet: misschecked the leaderboard
 Mal30: thx for the suggestion @SPDene - I'm sorry, I'm just not motivated for such
 RockyMullet: im 3rd
 RockyMullet: nice
 RockyMullet: and he is 32nd
 RockyMullet: martin is 2nd, he actually live in my city and I have no idea who he is, so misterious hehe
 Astrobytes: Is your ex-colleague still active on CG?
 RockyMullet: first beind reCurse obviously
 RockyMullet: not much
 RockyMullet: most of my ex colleague were like tryhard for 1-2 contest, then moved on
 HelloWorld183L: anybody familiar with "Horse-racing duels" to give me hints to what modification of the input data I need for (N-1 comparisons)?
 LelouchVC2: How about your ex-wife?
 RockyMullet: I never married so...
 jacek: HelloWorld183L how about sorting
 Ashraful: How to earn CodinPoints?
 LelouchVC2: sounds like the life
 Astrobytes: RockyMullet yeah it's a shame when people don't stick around
 LelouchVC2: Dont worry astrobytes
 LelouchVC2: I'll always be here for u
 RockyMullet: Ashraful do bot programming or contests, whatever involved other coders
 RockyMullet: its based on on well you do against others
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2 I meant sticking around on CG
 Ashraful: okay
 LelouchVC2: Yea, I'll always be here for you on CG&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Thrilling.
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 RockyMullet: personally that what motivates me, competing
 HelloWorld183L: ahh I didn't count the sorting as a loop because I was thinking of using LINQ (no loop)...
 Ashraful: Okay, it's then a CodinGame marriage corner.
 Ashraful: I was just kidding
 LelouchVC2: If he'll have me 
 RockyMullet: dont have to be number 1, otherwise I'd be depressed by now lol, but I like a good old tryhard session
 Astrobytes: Quite a few of my dev friends don't want to compete, which I find odd. Even if they didn't wanna compete you'd think they might find it a nice challenge at least
 LelouchVC2: not everyone is competitive
 Hjax: competitive programming is the best kind 
 LelouchVC2: Idk about that
 RockyMullet: yeah its something I realized, SPECIALLY with lead programmers and people higher in the herachy, they are affraid of not being the best and look bad
 RockyMullet: which is kind of sad
 Astrobytes: Yup, when actually you can have a bunch of fun doing it anyway
 RockyMullet: so they just, dont do it
 LelouchVC2: Coding overload
 Mal30: is this a great platform to get hired from?
 RockyMullet: egos are stupid
 Mal30: if you perform good at the code clashes?
 LelouchVC2: Not really
 Mal30: damn
 LelouchVC2: I doubt an employer will be like, "WOW! He's such a great clasher!"
 RockyMullet: I see it more as a way to learn, improve and pratice, than a way to get hired
 Mal30: but what if I include ASCII dicks in all of my submitted answers?
 Astrobytes: RockyMullet: Yep. And also the "Ah I don't know anything about that, I'm not good enough" people
 Hjax: you might be able to talk about algorithms you used in a multi in an interview
 LelouchVC2: If u have ascii dicks in all of ur answers
 LelouchVC2: u get hired immediately 
 HelloWorld183L: much more to it then just algorithms I would've thought...
 HelloWorld183L: for hiring i eman
 HelloWorld183L: mean*
 Mal30: well, looks like my future is sealed
 LelouchVC2: algorithms, nokes and crannies of ur language, problem solving skills
 Astrobytes: Yeah Hjax, providing you can describe what you were using it for that's 100% on point
 RockyMullet: Astrobytes yeah, the im not good enough, its pretty sad cause thats pretty much why I like it so much here, I make video games, I do make video game AI, but its so different, I learned a lot here
 RockyMullet: by getting out of my confort zone
 LelouchVC2: othello is gay
 RockyMullet: ok calm down big boi
 RockyMullet: we see you
 LelouchVC2: I added 2 if statements and that apparently makes my code take too long somehow
 Hjax: that has nothing to do with othello
 struct: Not game problem
 Astrobytes: RockyMullet Exactly! I'm a biologist ffs, I've learned everything I know about actual game-playing AIs on here
 LelouchVC2: I know, I'm taking it out on othello
 LelouchVC2: like men take it out on their wives
 Astrobytes: (as opposed to video game AI that is)
 RockyMullet: video game AI is meant to be fun and understandable, CG AI is meant to crush your enemies :smiling_imp:
 LelouchVC2: Anyway, something must be broken. 
 LelouchVC2: I literally just created a few vectors and a couple of if statements
 LelouchVC2: and it times out
 RockyMullet: LelouchVC2 you might have a code path that doesnt output anything
 RockyMullet: this leads to a timeout
 LelouchVC2: I put and output marker that it never reaches rockymullet
 Astrobytes: Yes. Massive difference of the two RockyMullet. Video game AI is designed to be beatable :D
 LelouchVC2: Just says did not output in time, and there's no reason as far as i can see
 Hjax: your program probably never outputs, its not a matter of speed 
 Astrobytes: paste your code, we can maybe help
 Hjax: it just doesnt work 
 LelouchVC2: If i put the cout &lt;&lt; before the if statement
 LelouchVC2: it outputs
 LelouchVC2: if after, it doesn't
 LelouchVC2: the if statement literally just checks some math
 LelouchVC2: There's no errors or crash
 RockyMullet: some times it crash and says its a timeout
 LelouchVC2: no timeout, just did not output in time
 RockyMullet: same thing
 LelouchVC2: a timeout is usually followed by a crash
 LelouchVC2: because it loops infinitely or something
 LelouchVC2: But if it says it did not output in time that usually just means the code is not optimized
 RockyMullet: well
 Astrobytes: Paste your code and we'll take a look, it's not a clash
 RockyMullet: im pretty sure you just dont output anything
 RockyMullet: thats the problem 99% of the time
 Astrobytes: ^
 LelouchVC2: Again, it outputs before the if statement
 LelouchVC2: doesnt after it
 LelouchVC2: I'll look at it for a sec and if i cant figure it out and ill copy it over
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: paste the six letters
 HelloWorld183L: how long should you spend on a challenge before giving up and finding a solution?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 I stopped posting them and just get them to hover over my avatar these days&#160;;)
 Hjax: what kind of challenge HelloWorld183L
 HelloWorld183L: one that feels like it's within reach but you just can't get to the answer
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/apG5owW_460swp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/apG5owW_460swp.webp</a>
 RockyMullet: HelloWorld183L a lot of the challengeds have dicussions on the forum
 Astrobytes: jacek :joy:
 RockyMullet: you can always dig there for inspiration
 RockyMullet: jacek it actually happened to me
 Hjax: i wouldnt recommend looking up the entire answer though 
 Hjax: you dont learn much when you do that 
 RockyMullet: kind of hard to type like that
 LelouchVC2: there we go, fixed the issue
 RockyMullet: Hjax yeah, thats the danger of looking up the final answer, you copy and dont actually understand the solution
 RockyMullet: LelouchVC2 what was the problem&#160;?
 Astrobytes: That really boils my piss
 LelouchVC2: The compiler is just retarded so it couldn't tell that i was going out of bounds on an array
 RockyMullet: so you crashed
 LelouchVC2: silent crash, no error, nothing
 Astrobytes: OK darkhorse64, I'll do it now.P E B C A C
 LelouchVC2: i used -'0' instead of -'a'
 RockyMullet: yeah you need to do some conversion in othello
 Hjax: problem exists between cat and computer? :P
 RockyMullet: like the lines starts at 1, not 0
 LelouchVC2: problem exists in 1972 compiler
 LelouchVC2: If it crashes, it should say something
 LelouchVC2: If it doesn't crash, then there's no reason for it to not pass the if statement
 RockyMullet: what language are you using
 LelouchVC2: C++
 RockyMullet: well, in an IDE, it would be obvious
 darkhorse64: I'd say PEBCACisis,  averty bad disease
 LelouchVC2: Visual Studio would have given me the right signals
 RockyMullet: if you are using a c array, and index is nothing but offseted pointer
 Hjax: you are welcome to develop in visual studio and copy and paste into codingame 
 LelouchVC2: I used a vector
 LelouchVC2: it should have thrown an out of bounds error
 LelouchVC2: Thats one of the main points of a vector
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you know, if you use them wrong they don't work
 RockyMullet: yeah well C++ is an awesome beast that needs to be tamed :P
 LelouchVC2: Visual Studio always crashes if you go beyond a vector's allowed capacity
 LelouchVC2: Just a different coding environment that you have to get use to
 RockyMullet: yeah well CG is not always really specific on how it crashes
 RockyMullet: and yeah sometimes it says it timed out when it actually crashed
 LelouchVC2: IQ ++
 RockyMullet: yeah well its probably because they handle so many different languages
 RockyMullet: so the "generic" way must be "if anything fails, say it timedout"
 RockyMullet: pure assumption here
 struct: CG allows stderr
 struct: lots of sites dont have this
 LelouchVC2: Just sad cause I was all hyped about coding it when I started
 darkhorse64: There is nothing like CG in terms of IDE, content
 LelouchVC2: There was no indication that the program crashed or did anything
 darkhorse64: The main activity of a coder is not to add code but to remove bugs. Use cerr liberally
 LelouchVC2: when ur coding is left wing
 LelouchVC2: but u only eat the right wings of chickens
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, LelouchVC2, stop posting stupid/polarising comments to get attention btw, you'll get more if you're on topic - just some friendly advice
 LelouchVC2: Astrobytes it's for amusement, not attention
 Astrobytes: Amuse yourself in other ways
 Astrobytes: Like fixing your bugs
 LelouchVC2: I didn't know I entered the soviet union
 RockyMullet: yeah, you are walking the line...
 Astrobytes: Post whatever you like, I don't give a damn. But you'll have a better time if you quit being a shitposter
 RockyMullet: ^
 LelouchVC2: :o
 Aviolezt: hey can anyone explain to me smth?
 Mal30: nope.com
 Aviolezt: ty
 LelouchVC2: what is it?
 Aviolezt: Im doing the Chuck Norris problem and I solved it but when I run it here it doesnt work
 Aviolezt: in VS it does
 Aviolezt: its absolutly the same
 Aviolezt: code
 LelouchVC2: Is there an error or does it simply output wrong?
 radowns: different inputs?
 Aviolezt: its says my input is "nothing" but I give it an input 
 Aviolezt: and if i test with other values it shows them
 LelouchVC2: You can send ur code over
 Aviolezt: weird af
 ACSmith: Hi, new to codingame.com. is vb.net equivalent to excel's vb?
 RockyMullet: I think excel is VBA
 RockyMullet: if whatever I learned 15 years ago is still valid :P
 RockyMullet: so might be slightly different
 JBM:  i'm still curious about a definite answer to that
 boinkus: My question is bugged
 boinkus: Everyone has gotten 0 on it and the console is making no sense

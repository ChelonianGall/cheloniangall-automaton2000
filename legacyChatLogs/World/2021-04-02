 Caike: the more you do clash of codes the better u get right?
 jacek: maybe
 Westicles: if you have to ask that, your brain might need servicing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need under the hood servicing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe it's behind the hood
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ====)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler made the input order of Blockout z,y,x...I need y,z,x damnit

 AntiSquid: turtle strat&#160;?
 derjack: yeah keep defending the king
 SalmanShaik: hello
 GGMastry: I'm doing the basic Ai things
 GGMastry: And the boost won't work
 DaNinja: what have you tried?
 GGMastry: making it so when the checkpoint is a certain distance, it does console x y boost
 GGMastry: If it's not it does x y thrust
 GGMastry: With the angle stuff being the same for both boost and thrust
 GGMastry: I'm a very very novice newbie beginner coder though
 GGMastry: So it may be staring me in the face
 jacek: you can use boost only once per game
 GGMastry: Yeah but surely it would still do the boost once
 DaNinja: whats your output command?
 GGMastry: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd6eba73-30dc-4b2a-b780-258303bf3d3c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd6eba73-30dc-4b2a-b780-258303bf3d3c</a>
 GGMastry: Oh that's neat
 DaNinja: Console.WriteLine(nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointY + "  BOOST");
 DaNinja: try that?
 Robin-Hood: hii
 GGMastry: It worked!
 DaNinja: gg
 GGMastry: I need to fix it since it boosted at the start
 GGMastry: But it works
 GGMastry: How does it work though
 DaNinja: what was your BOOST variable set to? 
 GGMastry: 20 or 100 depending on the angle to the checkpoint
 DaNinja: it needs to be a string with "BOOST" for boost to work
 GGMastry: Ooooh
 GGMastry: I just assumed since it said to replace thrust
 GGMastry: That it would be a int
 GGMastry: Oh I just connected dots without reading
 GGMastry: I just saw the " " in the green text
 jacek: who reads the statement nowadays
 GGMastry: Not me
 DaNinja: :D
 GGMastry: Also how come the code doesn't work with commas
 GGMastry: But works with + " " +
 GGMastry: Like I assume it'd be like 100100100 instead of 100 100 100
 GGMastry: But it just says something about char[] converting into int error
 jacek: theres space in " "
 jacek: what lang is it
 GGMastry: C#
 Lisker5006: ai is for losers
 jacek: so it has string + int concatenation
 DaNinja: with commas, Writeline expects the format in the first param: WriteLine (string format, object? arg0, object? arg1, object? arg2);
 GGMastry: I need to search up these words
 GGMastry: But I somewhat understand
 GGMastry: writeline goes like my pfp without string, especially in between variables
 GGMastry: Or well multiple variables
 jacek: orangesnowfox look what you have done. i went back to onitama and slightly improved my bot
 GGMastry: Thanks jacek and DaNinja
 GGMastry: I absolutely destroyed Boss 3 with some tweaks
 DaNinja: Legend next!
 Robin-Hood: can anybody help me with CSB wood 2 ti bronze
 Robin-Hood: to bronze
 Robin-Hood: you need only replace the thrust value by the BOOST keyword. i do it but not worked
 Robin-Hood: DaNinja
 DaNinja: "whats your output command?"
 GGMastry: Oh fuck
 GGMastry: Needs more tweaking
 GGMastry: But my angles and distance to make boost makes me not boost&#160;;-;
 Robin-Hood: if next_checkpoint_angle&gt;90 or next_checkpoint_angle&lt;-90: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74978869-43ac-4db3-b345-d98be2891a80">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74978869-43ac-4db3-b345-d98be2891a80</a>
 GGMastry: Oh wait I might be dumb
 Robin-Hood: it says i defeated boss but i am not going to next league
 Robin-Hood: DaNinja
 DaNinja: give it a minute
 DaNinja: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " BOOST" )
 jacek: you submited to the arena?
 GGMastry: Which degree would be straight for nextCheckpoint Angle?
 DaNinja: 0? I dont remember
 GGMastry: Uh oh
 Robin-Hood: I am not going to next league  
 Robin-Hood: it takes several minute
 Robin-Hood: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " BOOST" ) it not worked
 Robin-Hood: DaNinja
 GGMastry: Ooooh wait I'm dumb I think
 GGMastry: Cause the map I'm on is straight to the first checkpoint
 GGMastry: I'm boosting at the start and I miss it
 Robin-Hood: nobody helping me
 Robin-Hood: :disappointed:
 GGMastry: Sorry chief I have as much knowledge as you right now
 Robin-Hood: ohh wait i am in Rank 3
 Robin-Hood: i think vode work
 GGMastry: Ok so how many simulations does it do for Ranking
 Robin-Hood: code work 
 GGMastry: I went from 5th to 1st
 GGMastry: Is it testing the flexability of the code?
 Robin-Hood: i am in 5th 
 Robin-Hood: or congarats GGMastry
 Robin-Hood: can u tell me what u do
 GGMastry: Oh shit I just realized we are in the same ranking Robin
 Robin-Hood: GGMastry
 GGMastry: We are at the same part of the AI stuff
 Robin-Hood: yeah
 Robin-Hood: plz tell me what u do
 GGMastry: Well for me I just added extra conditions
 GGMastry: So that it doesn't boost at the start
 Robin-Hood: plz given me your code
 GGMastry: It has to be a certain distance so it doesn't go overboard
 GGMastry: And angle so it's straight
 Robin-Hood: only for seen not for coping
 Robin-Hood: my ranking 4
 GGMastry: Since you are in the same ranking board as me
 GGMastry: I'll keep my code my code
 GGMastry: But use what I said to help yourself
 Robin-Hood: i am totally confused or none is helping me
 GGMastry: I need to tweak my code though
 GGMastry: I think having boosters on during turns is fucking me up
 GGMastry: If you're number 4 Robin it means your code is doing welll
 Robin-Hood: my ranking 2
 GGMastry: Some people have just tweaked it better
 Robin-Hood: i think after some time i will go to next league
 GGMastry: Oh I think that's ranking for the specific scenario
 GGMastry: Not the league inherently
 Robin-Hood: can u just show me your code
 Robin-Hood: what u do 
 jacek: oO
 Robin-Hood: jacek can u help me
 jacek: im csb noob
 Robin-Hood: okk
 Robin-Hood: congrats 
 Robin-Hood: GGMastry you don't go to next leagye
 Robin-Hood: it seems you go
 Robin-Hood: ranking 8
 GGMastry: I'm just trynna tweak this code
 GGMastry: Because somehow the boss catches up to me
 Robin-Hood: can u show your code
 Robin-Hood: plz
 GGMastry: You won't learn if I just give you the batch of my code
 GGMastry: I said
 GGMastry: For boosting
 GGMastry: I check the distance so it doesn't go overboard, and I make sure the angle is correct
 GGMastry: Play off that
 Robin-Hood: ranking 8655
 Robin-Hood: i am leaving
 GGMastry: Oh shit yeah  I made it to bronze league just by tweaking my code?
 jacek: you can get to silver with bunch of ifs
 Robin-Hood: jacek 
 Robin-Hood: i am totally confused
 GGMastry: "You can now collide"
 GGMastry: Me: " Console.WriteLine(opponentX + " " + opponentY + " BOOST" + " " + thrust
 Robin-Hood: AntiSquid can u help me with CSB
 DaNinja: how to win CSB here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/coders-strike-back-puzzle-discussion/1833">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/coders-strike-back-puzzle-discussion/1833</a>
 GGMastry: I have no idea how to utilize the collision
 Uljahn: just ignore it until gold/legend league
 AntiSquid: is it in silver? you use the opponent as a braking mechanism, bump into them while turning towards next check point so you push them away and reach check point easier
 DaNinja: focus on going faster, aim for cp-3*vel 
 GGMastry: I'm in bronze rn
 AntiSquid: does it even have collision?
 GGMastry: Yeah
 AntiSquid: i dont remember anymore lol
 GGMastry: DaNinja I have no idea what cp-3*vel means
 DaNinja: subtract 3 times your velocity from the checkpoint position and aim for that
 Scarfield: cp check point ie. your target position. then adjust your target position in respect to your current vel
 GGMastry: Is velocity thrust or related to it
 DaNinja: if you dont get velocity in the inputs, calculate it by subtracting your previous position from your current position
 Scarfield: ooh yea, you didnt get your vel in all leagues
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/s1DZS2I">https://imgur.com/a/s1DZS2I</a>
 GGMastry: Oh shit you went to Oxford Uni
 GGMastry: That's a high class Uni
 AntiSquid: ugh which one?
 AntiSquid: i went to many oxford universities
 DaNinja: janitor?
 GGMastry: THE Oxford Uni
 GGMastry: I can only hope for Uni of Glasgow in the future
 AntiSquid: no, but would there be a problem DaNinja?
 DaNinja: not at all&#160;:)

 AntiSquid: chef, some really posh kitchens, DaNinja
 Scarfield: this site has some really nice explanations and illustrations for how to approach steering with vectors&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: there is a Magu s tutorial on GA for CSB btw
 jacek: Magus? the creator of AutomatonNN?
 jacek: erm AutomatonNN
 AntiSquid: i tried not ping him for no reason LOL
 jacek: :c
 jacek: there is reason
 Magus: AutomatonNN is dead :o
 Magus: Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: and there is no spoon
 Scarfield: you have been put on an ignore list im sure
 Magus: Your brother is dead and you don't care&#160;!
 AntiSquid: sounds like he made automatonNN soup :thinking:
 Scarfield: xD
 GGMastry: I'm actually fuming
 GGMastry: My guy missed the checkpoin
 GGMastry: And did a loop
 AntiSquid: post pics of the fumes
 Scarfield: thats why you want to adjust where you aim according to your current velocity.

 AntiSquid: horrible female lead jacek
 jacek: hm?
 GGMastry: I don't have the velocity stuff yet
 GGMastry: But my code seems to be doing decent now that I tweaked it a bit
 GGMastry: So that it doesn't overshadow the point
 GGMastry: It takes so long for the battle simulations
 Ordonnateur: how can we report a bug on codingame evaluation&#160;? (the tutorial "find a number in an array" in java end everytime in a failure state whatever I do (the test case being good bug the validator fail at the first thing so nothing is good))
 Ordonnateur: (I also did the same tutorial like 2-4 week earlier with the same code (from internet) and it was working so it's not an issue with it)
 jacek: try discord
 GGMastry: Rank 1 just below the Boss
 GGMastry: ;C
 Robin-Hood: i want to say why CG ban my first account
 Ordonnateur: jacek, what's the https link please&#160;? ^^'
 Scarfield: join us on discord in top of chat
 Ordonnateur: (I did but it don't give the link it just use the web interface ç_ç)
 jacek: huh
 Robin-Hood: Why CG ban my first account
 GGMastry: How would you write out if variable is less than number of variable
 Ordonnateur: (Ah it's good, it did a weird thing few min ago &gt;&lt;')
 Robin-Hood: why u ban my first accountRobin-hood
 Westicles: Who is the ombudsman here?
 jacek:&#160;:?
 Westicles: Perhaps we can contact Claire Hédon
 AntiSquid: i don't who banned the new robin hood accounts, i wanted to but by the time i tried to ban the accounts were already gone ... just saying

 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: :thinking:

 jacek: is it easy though?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: seems easy enough :thinking:
 AntiSquid: hm i was wondering that too, technically yes since the query is extremely basic, it's basic sorting and searching
 AntiSquid: compare it to ASCII cg puzzle, i think it's easy in that regard
 Crypticsy: agh your profile pic changed so didn't find your contribution, looking into it
 AntiSquid: escape the cat used to be under easy 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: under easy&#160;??

 FlatMystery_b58c: hello world
 FlatMystery_b58c: *tumbleweeds"
 jacek:  
 FlatMystery_b58c:  
 AntiSquid: Crypticsy it doesn't tell you clearly by how much you need to go down after each peak, i am guessing based on the test cases it's one "\"
 AntiSquid: Once a peak has been drawn, proceed either up or down to the next peak. Do not return to 0 between peaks.
 AntiSquid: for example if the next peak is higher why do i only go down 1 and not 2 before climbing @_@
 DomiKo: Hmmm why CG Stats don't show 4 Players games stats&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: for which game
 DomiKo: Hypersonic
 DomiKo: second ago I could see stats for 4P
 DomiKo: and now I can't&#160;:(
 DomiKo: HMMMM
 DomiKo: only for me 
 DomiKo: LOL
 AntiSquid: agressively ping magu s until he fixes it&#160;?
 DomiKo: or
 DomiKo: I can resubmit
 DomiKo: and maybe it will fix it?
 DomiKo: if not
 DomiKo: I will ping him
 AntiSquid: do it
 jacek: why not both
 AntiSquid: yes, good thinking
 Crypticsy: just go down by one to make this shape  /\ cause this looks more like a peak
 AntiSquid: ya just saying maybe you could mention this somewhere, but i see you have overall more positive feedback just no approvers
 Crypticsy: yep, that's the issue
 Mritunjay4ever: yo
 AntiSquid: is the variable n needed? Just split the 2nd line of input and check the size() to find out number of peaks 
 DomiKo: Ohhh yes resubmit solved the problem :D
 AntiSquid: cool beans
 FlatMystery_b58c: a heisenbug?
 Crypticsy: yeah but it's for the other languages honestly, not needed for python
 FlatMystery_b58c: could it be?
 AntiSquid: for any language you split by delimiter afaik, c++ at least
 AntiSquid: but since it's easy category ... maybe ... oof
 ErrorRazor: It does say "mountains are made from a step lower than their peak", but I think "mountains start from" would be more clear
 ErrorRazor: Or maybe not
 FlatMystery_b58c: 🗻
 Westicles: ASCII art puzzles are evil enough without making one with characters you have to escape
 ErrorRazor: Escape?
 Westicles: It is hangman all over again
 AntiSquid: this isn't the worst ascii puzzle imo
 AntiSquid: i am biased against them, but this one is quite simple
 Westicles: Or that weird cisnerian one that got deleted
 Westicles: cistercian
 AntiSquid: ah damn, you're not allowed to draw more than min and max n
 Crypticsy: didn't know sql could be fun
 jacek: fun?
 imrel: autovacuum
 Crypticsy: i mean doing sql through his puzzle
 imrel: totally fun
 jacek: so sql doesnt suck?
 AntiSquid: sql is still widely used, whether it's fun or not is subjective
 trictrac: hello jacek, I just validate "night of war", if you want to push a bot&#160;?

 davilla: these people!
 davilla: if you downvote and you can't give a reason, I have a special word reserved for you that I can't say here
 jacek: pee pee?
 jigawhat: voldemort?
 davilla: there's an old joke that there is an A in TEAM after all. if you know the joke then you know the word
 davilla: oops I in TEAM
 jacek: the A-Team?
 davilla: :rolling_eyes:
 jigawhat: 🗻
 Westicles: you downvote because you don't like it.  what else is there to say?
 AntiSquid: did you mention why you don't like it?
 Westicles: most people don't
 AntiSquid: ah wait, are we talking about downvotes or rejections? @_@
 AntiSquid: ya most people don't say why they upvote either
 AntiSquid: oh well, ask in chat or write a comment: "if you downvote please consider telling me what i can improve"
 AntiSquid: i think this is a better approach then trying to indirectly call them stuff
 davilla: yeah no, it's not many people for me. I saw one poor chap who did that after getting several downvoted. I felt bad for him
 davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63781be2ffa90acc7b9e50f23fa49280f6ac">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63781be2ffa90acc7b9e50f23fa49280f6ac</a>
 AntiSquid: the statement could be rephrased to something more simple
 Westicles: You aren't allowed to reject clashes for being too easy... but that is too easy
 davilla: well per my comment, it would be a good reverse
 davilla: maybe a bit more tucked away
 davilla: anyway, no one said as much
 AntiSquid: i am refraining really hard from downvoting that one
 AntiSquid: it's a clash, it's fine as a clash imo
 AntiSquid: but if you do lots of clashes you will instantly recognize this one and type out the answer in few seconds / insta submit
 davilla: yeah, except for his rules... not sure why he insists on so much rigor
 davilla: I'm sure I could write it better
 jacek: then make contributions and make it approved
 jacek: thatll show him
 davilla: you want me to edit his??
 Westicles: ha, looks like the cribbage guy got all four of his puzzles approved
 jacek: copy his contrib and post as own :v
 AntiSquid: and why does he split join strip whatever in the solution @_@
 davilla: oh yeah, I was gonna wait a few days and do that
 davilla: whatever, I guess I could do it today
 AntiSquid: he just need to r += first chat lol
 AntiSquid: maybe this is why clashers throw a tantrum when they see shortest?
 jacek: AntiSquid its called divide and conquer algorithm
 davilla: lol
 davilla: wow, you guys are meaner than the downvoters&#160;:-P
 Westicles: I think I'll make a series of 45 canasta clashes
 AntiSquid: it's alright for clash still 
 AntiSquid: meaner? 
 AntiSquid: didn't you say it's awful he doesn't get any feedback to improve&#160;?
 AntiSquid: didn't give any downvote either @_@
 davilla: OK good on you
 davilla: I'll make a constructive comment about his code
 imrel: meaner? or more average? (pun intended)
 davilla: oh wait, I think he was doing that because he wants multiple lines interpreted as a single space
 jacek: :drum:
 imrel: so its not too simple, perfect for CoC?
 Westicles: well, its no Drying Cucumber
 davilla: oh, there's got to be a story behind that
 murrayr: yay for cribbage
 Westicles: congrats, I never thought the cribbage cycle would get approved :P
 jacek:&#160;?
 Westicles: he made four cribbage clashes...
 jacek: cabbage eh?
 murrayr: score cabbage? slice cabbage!
 murrayr: cribbage, it's a card game with a large chunk of randomness in the result, but some interesting scoring methods
 murrayr: I half wonder about making a bot version of it, but at the moment I'm trying to write some chess AI
 jacek: chess on cg?
 Westicles: all those poor 12 yo Indian clashers trying to figure out cribbage
 Westicles: I made a baseball clash and turns out nobody knows what baseball is
 jacek: :soccer:?
 davilla: I thought baseball was international
 murrayr: for most people, cribbage is just part of the story. they don't need to know the game to solve the puzzles
 Westicles: Next time euler comes around, someone ask him to take Number Shifting up to 2000
 jacek: but cpu and gpu are so expensive now
 Westicles: Well, I mean most of us already own computers so shouldn't be a problem
 AntiSquid: why not infinite then lol
 kovi: lets save the planet, and leave ns as it is
 3ataja: reject humanity return to monke
 AntiSquid: but some say it's monkeys raped by aliens, why can't we return to aliens instead&#160;?
 3ataja: we know nothing about aliens so it's safer to return to something we know about
 AntiSquid: i guess we could enter a long debate about the found remains of humanoids
 AntiSquid: no time for that

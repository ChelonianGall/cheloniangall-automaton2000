 IOI2020: how to get more xp
 Uljahn: solve puzzles, promote in multiplayers, unlock achievements
 struct: morning
 thanhhv317: here is afternoon
 cnmdcbg: hey
 TheBigBadGhost_936a: hello 
 cnmdcbg: 你好
 jacek: good morning
 AI_says_hi: o/
 zhoubou: :hand_splayed:
 ivnbcr: hi all
 Passifi: top of the morning to you fellas and felicitases
 Angecide: morning all, I have been trying to understand mcts solver lately, so my ultra high level understanding is that it is just a regular mcts until the a node in the tree reaches a terminal stage, in which case the algo tries to prove/disprove the move path? does this sound correct?
 Angecide: since at the start, it is impossible to prove anything since the search space i huge, but once u reach mid/lategame, the search space is small and the algo can start to get more confident 
 Angecide: and I am still gold in uttt, turns out my huge performance boost didn't add anything since my mcts algo is not converging that well, I think it is too random in design + perhaps I shouldn't have used a xorshit8bit prng since it isn't really that random + potential bugs
 struct: how many rollouts do you get?
 Angecide: 40k or something, so something is definitely wrong 
 jacek: try xorshift64
 jacek: and those rollouts should be enough for legend
 jacek: as for mcts solver. what do you do if you encounter final state in selection?
 Angecide: I just return the value back up, as if it was the result of a simulation
 Angecide: like for my normal mcts
 jacek: ok
 Angecide: I am still in the process of understand what mcts solver is and how it differs from the normal algo
 jacek: my solver gave 55-60% winrate, but still it should be enough for legend
 Angecide: ye going through all the replays my ai played, I found one instance where I did an "invalid action", so I need to go on a bug hunt, since I presume my algo is converging badly because of false premise of the state of the game
 jacek: happy bug hunting then
 jacek: mcts solver is quite simple. it is just the mcts solver is complicated
 jacek: mcts olver paper*
 k4ng0u: Angecide, my bot only have around 8k per turn and passed to Legend. Do you do full random rollouts or do you have some early exits? typically in my rollouts when I have a winning move, I ignore the othres and just play it. This prunes a lot of unrelevant states
 Angecide: I do a very bad (but fast) pseudo random rollout, but I believe adding heuristics such as always playing winning moves and avoiding losing moves could help too
 Uljahn: also exploration coefficient can cause bad convergence, have you tried to vary it?
 Angecide: ye, so my current definition of evaluating whether or not my mcts is converging is by checking if it forces the enemy player onto the same board (if possible) during the very early stages of the game
 k4ng0u: avoiding losing moves is a depth 1 simulation for each move, it would be too time consuming. Also note that it would be covered on your opponent turn by always playing winning moves 
 Angecide: like even after 40 secs of searching, it doesn't recommend forcing enemly player onto the same board, so i suspect something is wrong
 codybumba: If anybody is interested in CoC please join this private clash - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1544652d4ca36a11f6da00d0a8255e74cdeb9db">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1544652d4ca36a11f6da00d0a8255e74cdeb9db</a>
 darkhorse64: This is an heuristic which took years to find so it is not surpising your bot does not  find it. Re solver, remember you can backpropagate solved nodes: if you have a win, it means the parent is a loss, if all children are losses, it means the parent is a win and so on. This way you can predict a game result 10 to 20 plies in advance
 jacek: darkhorse64 my bot can find it most of the time with less than 5 seconds
 Angecide: ahh I think it is making sense now, it was a bit unclear from the paper, but I am starting to grasp what mcts solver is and that it is really not that complicated
 jacek: another mcts solver paper victim
 darkhorse64: Only the first 100 ms matter to me:grinning:
 darkhorse64: Basically, that's what the paper says but it does not really need several pages
 darkhorse64: low cost optim, high reward
 Angecide: ye now with the intuition in place, it makes sense when reading the paper again
 darkhorse64: jacek: you seem to have improved your C4 bot lately. Did my code help&#160;? Did you see any difference between AVX and scalar&#160;?
 jacek: i trained n-tuple. i switched from pure mcts to jacekmax
 Angecide: jacekmax :thinking:
 darkhorse64: Great but that does not help me. I have some planned improvements but there is no point to do it now before approval. How many weights&#160;? Straight or random&#160;?
 Angecide: nvm I found the playground article
 jacek: every row-of-4, theres 126 of them. i didnt reduce for symmetry
 jacek: and i didnt try your code
 darkhorse64: To make things clear, I would have had no problem with it. I shared it after all
 jacek: well if you would have problem, i wouldnt confess&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: :relaxed:
 jacek: meh i registered to the computer draughts forum, but it is admin activated :c
 Kokoz: anyone want to help with a noob question?
 jacek: you mean 2 questions
 AI_says_hi: lol
 Kokoz: no, only one
 AI_says_hi: kokoz u already asked one&#160;;-)
 darkhorse64: ^
 darkhorse64: kokoz: go ahead
 jacek: meaybe he really meant 1 question
 AI_says_hi: hehe jokes on us 
 Kokoz: so, I have a list [2, 3, 6, 7]How to get the diffference between every number and all numbers before it?? like this:3-2, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6, 7-3, 7-2
 AI_says_hi: Think about using the modulo operator
 AI_says_hi: Actually no I'm dumb&#160;:) think about using nested loops
 darkhorse64: is it for the horses race&#160;?
 Kokoz: I am actually trying to make a nested loop but I dont know how to write it&#160;:\
 Kokoz: No.. I finished the horse race puzzle
 darkhorse64: a for loop inside the for loop
 darkhorse64: for() { for () {} }
 struct: you make a inner loop that goes from current pos to position 0
 struct: i=0;i&lt;end;++ij=i-1;j&gt;=0;--j
 Kokoz: I tried something like that but I guess I wrote it wrong.. I will play around more, thank you
 AI_says_hi: Kokoz what language are you using?
 Kokoz: Python
 SPDene: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/651ccb83-2ab5-4298-b013-d410619e9bd2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/651ccb83-2ab5-4298-b013-d410619e9bd2</a>
 SPDene: kokoz ^ that was message for you
 AI_says_hi: How do you make such pastebins? 
 SPDene: just paste enough text, and it will auto-convert it
 AI_says_hi: oh okay thanks!
 Kokoz: Ohhh, thank you SPDene, I was so close with my code :DMy mistake was that I put the a = x[i] in the second loop.. Which was dumb
 Kokoz: Soo, everything is fine untill the input has a huge amount of information.. Then my code cant handle it
 struct: yeah, you can do this with 1 loop only
 struct: oh wait
 AI_says_hi: What puzzle are you on?
 struct: maybe not
 Kokoz: Stock exchange losses
 SPDene: not seem that one before - but I don't think you need the differences for ALL the previous values - just the *highest* value efore now
 AI_says_hi: ^ thats right
 Kokoz: so in that case [1, 2, 4, 4, 5]what will be the result?
 AI_says_hi: 0
 AI_says_hi: Are you sorting the values?
 Kokoz: no
 AI_says_hi: In [1, 2, 4, 4, 5] there is no drop, all numbers are &gt;= to the one before
 AI_says_hi: so highest loss is 0
 Kokoz: Exactly
 AI_says_hi: So then what is the problem?
 Kokoz: I still have to use loop to check all other numbers
 Kokoz: I have an idea
 Kokoz: so if the input is sorted then in all cases there is no lost.. 
 Kokoz: Nice, thank youu C:
 AI_says_hi: did you manage?&#160;:)
 Kokoz: not yet, but on the right track :D
 AI_says_hi: good good

 Salman2301: I had the fastest mode I am just not ready for that
 lopidav: &gt;Why can't we choose which mode.I guess the whole system will have to be redesigned. People would learn Ruby/Perl and play shortest exclusively 
 RoboStac: plus there are  already bots to get enough players for it to work without splitting it further
 READY: I am READY for that, Salman2301
 TheMightyTopHat_dc86: Me i am all out
 Pad0000001: In the AI pod racing stuff, can i check out others' code?
 jacek: CSB? no
 JM54: Soon may the wellerman come to bring us sugar and tea and rum
 Astrobytes: WTF. Since when do people sing sea shanties on the reg.

 Astrobytes: No I remember the story, from years ago. Something about bood types iirc
 Astrobytes: *blood
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 Almost404: hello guys im new here and i am having tones of fun
 Almost404: this is great
 Astrobytes: afternoon euler
 Almost404: sad i didnt see this sooner
 Astrobytes: Well it's not gonna disappear so you still have time Almost404
 eulerscheZahl: you mean: "sad I didn't see this soccer"here it is: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/paper-soccer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/paper-soccer</a>
 Almost404: im happy i also made today my first problem contribution anyone wants to see it?
 Astrobytes: oO
 JM54: As a beginner in code and barely starting to learn python, the puzzles in this game are way beyond my understanding
 Astrobytes: JM54: the site does assume familiarity and a certain level of competence in your language
 Astrobytes: It's not an absolute beginner-friendly site.
 JM54: dang
 JM54: sucks i got assigned this then
 eulerscheZahl: who assigned it to you?
 eulerscheZahl: a teacher?
 JM54: My CSP teacher
 bobth: some puzzles are super easy but most will need some experience imo
 Astrobytes: Just practice with the language a bit more and you should be able to do some of the easy puzzles
 JM54: Noted, thanks
 SPDene: also be aware that some "easy" puzzles are a lot more difficult than others
 Astrobytes: ^
 JM54: Ok
 darkhorse64: However, a good advice is to separate coding from algorithm. Do some paper reasoning first and then, only then, translate it into code
 bobth: pseudocode is very helpful
 JM54: :thumbsup_tone3:
 BlaiseEbuth: Paper&#160;? What is this&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: or less fun. even thibaud mentioning Defibrilators here
 Astrobytes: Yep, very sound advice.
 Astrobytes: lol euler, right
 JM54: onm
 eulerscheZahl: i'd add aneo to that list
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: BlaiseEbuth I found that paper: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sketch.io/sketchpad/">https://sketch.io/sketchpad/</a>
 darkhorse64: There is no data parsing which is really the worst
 jacek: a sketch? like that one before?

 Astrobytes: you still have that jacek?
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks eulerscheZahl, I was wrong, I thought that paper was slices of innocent tree corpses...
 jacek: on my personal comp, not here
 eulerscheZahl: i will neither complain about the clash link nor the username
 jacek: Oo
 eulerscheZahl: we want to engage more newcomers&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Same.
 BlaiseEbuth: Frfllf... :shrug:
 jacek: i see smits still posting c4 moves
 jacek: and 0 seems to be losing after all
 Astrobytes: Is that the move that was oscillating?
 jacek: yes
 AnalPainGiver: I am looking for enaging clash of clans where all the opponents are live on twitch
 AnalPainGiver: code*

 BlaiseEbuth: your what&#160;?
 Almost404: is this too hard for a clash? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/609613f0fb1078f73696777d6b128c5ae046">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/609613f0fb1078f73696777d6b128c5ae046</a>
 ChampionCoder: I felt it was hard
 Almost404: check it again I redid the solution, literally the solution is 1 line after data ready
 ChampionCoder: Oh ok
 ChampionCoder:&#160;:+1:
 ChampionCoder: looks better now
 eulerscheZahl: "Every quarter of what's left he stops for air because he is fat."isn't that an infinite sequence?
 Almost404: tks maybe i shouldn't have made a detailed solution it made it look it was harder than it actually was
 Almost404: that's true let me fix that
 Uljahn: kinda hard yes, 'cause you need several minutes just to read and understand the statement
 SinOfWrath: Also by doing integer division in your solution, I'm fairly certain it's incorrect when speed is not a divisor of 100.
 SPDene: Almost404 "Velocity = Time = Distance/Velocity" confuses me. did you redefine the laws of physics? :P
 ChampionCoder: :sweat_smile:
 Almost404: sleep deprivation is getting me :joy:
 ChampionCoder: By the way, why is "fat" in bold?Just make it normal, not bold
 Almost404: discard this shiet i tryed need to review this
 eulerscheZahl: "fat" in fat text? makes sense to me :P
 ChampionCoder: Lol
 kovi: old john...an impressive start on cg (and nice background, started programming/boardgames earlier than me)
 ChampionCoder: Sorry?
 Astrobytes: He worked alongside Buro and Le Renard
 eulerscheZahl: Buro?
 Astrobytes: Michael Buro
 darkhorse64: We are getting more and more smart people
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i'm not up to date with the users anymore
 Astrobytes: (of Logistello fame amongs many other things)
 Astrobytes: Did Le Renard create Thor?
 Astrobytes: (othello program)
 jacek: this old john was having books wars with smits in othello
 Astrobytes: Still is afaik
 kovi: i have just noticed him, as he jumped to #3 in d&amp;b
 jacek: still losing, yes
 MSmits: he stopped for now. I think we agreed to a draw
 MSmits: (not sure though)
 eulerscheZahl: a draw with you above him on the leaderboard
 MSmits: i do better against other players
 MSmits: interesting about D&amp;B
 MSmits: I'll try a resubmit with random on. My current submit is deterministic
 MSmits: (this version did better vs remi)
 MSmits: i should say, i use fixed seed currently, i'll change to a time based seed
 eulerscheZahl: so the survey results are out

 eulerscheZahl: i modified the URL a bit to confuse their tracking of how we got there :P
 MSmits: is codingame the nr 1 tech hiring platform?
 MSmits: or is this just advertising?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. source: CodinGame
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: there are some other big players like Hackerrank and Hackerearth
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: isnt linkedin a tech hiring platform also, technically?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if CG really is the #1. by what metric even?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, good point
 eulerscheZahl: maybe tech hiring = coding assessments in the understanding of CG marketing
 MSmits: could be
 eulerscheZahl: let's just say: be careful what you read and don't believe anything
 MSmits: oh I am that, I was just wondering
 eulerscheZahl: so: don't believe me when I say that
 MSmits: surely you are an exception
 eulerscheZahl: the truthful toad
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm still at page 1 of that survey
 MSmits: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: "48% of companies offer developers the possibility to work 100% remotely"how to measure that?
 MSmits: maybe this just was a question?
 eulerscheZahl: they only ask for the company size in that survey, not the company itself. how to find duplicate companies?
 MSmits: oh
 jacek: :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: because it's about companies that allow remote and not devs working remotely
 MSmits: that might be problematic yeah
 jacek: more remote last year i presume
 eulerscheZahl: let's take notes for when Thibaud posts it on the forum or discord
 MSmits: do you want to open a thread: "questions from the 5%"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 5% that cause 50% of Thibauds work :P
 MSmits: no doubt about that
 darkhorse64: 50% headache also
 jrke: can anyone just tell me that what happened yesterday brainstorming on discord in breif?
 eulerscheZahl: too bad inoryy wasn't there yesterday :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud summarized it on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-regular-events-lets-discuss-it-on-discord/188710/11">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-regular-events-lets-discuss-it-on-discord/188710/11</a>
 MSmits: allright, so basically D&amp;B is like: Miklla 1st, then the next 3 as a group. Therés no clear 2-3-4 order
 darkhorse64: There have been some clarifications from Thibaud and G-Rom. One thing is sure; community contests are gone. There might more regular, fast events
 eulerscheZahl: and you allow miklla to do that?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl not in the long term ofc&#160;:)
 MSmits: D&amp;B is a very complicated multi, i cant improve my bot ina day 
 eulerscheZahl: but these "fast events" don't sound like original content at all
 jrke: MSmits thinks deep in life as well as in bot
 eulerscheZahl: just some old meal in the microwave
 eulerscheZahl: so at least I am not interested
 jacek: fast event? clash wars?
 eulerscheZahl: also
 darkhorse64: No news from AshKetchum. No C4 yet
 eulerscheZahl: some extended version of the puzzle of the week with more featuring
 MSmits: jrke thanks, i take that as a compliment :P
 jacek: no news for the chess either
 jrke: MSmits that was the compliment ,nothing else
 eulerscheZahl: fireworks at 2 approval votes
 eulerscheZahl: i just opened it to dive into it
 MSmits: it's original enough
 eulerscheZahl: then survey, then chat
 eulerscheZahl: i'm easy to distract
 MSmits: me too, I actually should go grade some christmas postcards
 eulerscheZahl: you teach arts now?
 eulerscheZahl: in elementary school
 MSmits: mmh i guess kinda
 MSmits: this is a python turtle assignment
 eulerscheZahl: aah
 MSmits: they had to draw a sun, trees, road, snow, text all with python code
 eulerscheZahl: my first thought: there must be a 2nd meaning for "grade" but let's nag smits with it
 MSmits: hehe it's just 3 possible grades
 MSmits: fail, sufficient, good
 MSmits: so it's not hard to grade
 eulerscheZahl: do you also grade the code style or just the outcome?
 MSmits: this is the very first time they code anything in their life basically
 MSmits: so style is not really an issue
 eulerscheZahl: except for indents
 MSmits: well it has to work :P
 eulerscheZahl: i'm on page 3 of the survey already
 jrke: survey? which survey?

 eulerscheZahl: i invented a new utm_medium key just to confuse Thibaud or whoever reviews that
 MSmits: this is my D&amp;B submit, pretty clear:

 eulerscheZahl: when you have to clarify that keras = python, that user clearly isn't an expert in it
 jacek: MSmits you get pwnd by miklla
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: dunno, maybe there is keras c#, i may never know

 MSmits: well you won that one though jrke
 MSmits: jacek i actually know why he wins
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a kera expert: kera finished 4th in the Ghost in the Cell contest
 jrke: just random seed but my endgame solver is bugged
 MSmits: it's very well documented how to play this game and it's hard to code a bot for it
 MSmits: he counts chains
 MSmits: you see he has a typical strategy of forming the right number of chains
 MSmits: he doesnt just randomly place lines
 MSmits: my bot is random for 50 plies
 MSmits: of course that's gonna fail against anyone who knows what they're doing in ply 1-50
 karliso: wow, clean 100% submits... 
 jacek: fix your uttt bot
 karliso: :D
 MSmits: oh, right karliso, i wonder if re curse 's bot is really stronger than yours or he just picked one that is strong against your current choice of bot
 MSmits: try to make a small alteration
 MSmits: then test it
 eulerscheZahl: oh, he submitted his NN now
 jacek: oh and im not the only one with misleading eval <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/521616666">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/521616666</a>
 MSmits: after all i was able to get 100% as p1 vs your current bot, so a trained nn may get lucky on one iteration also
 karliso: yea, I looked at it. I think I had like 33% as white and 34% as balck...
 MSmits: thats very interesting
 jacek: see how robo in 54 says 0.92 while clealy losing
 jacek: white black in uttt? o.O
 MSmits: i am just guesing white is p1
 MSmits: guessing
 karliso: yeah, I tend to forget who is ) and who is X
 MSmits: X is first :P
 MSmits: it's weird though karliso, something is off here
 MSmits: no way should your p1 bot have 33% 
 MSmits: not even vs a perfect playing bot
 MSmits: the disadvantage of p2 is too large
 MSmits: I am guessing almost every game is the same
 MSmits: with 2 deterministic bots
 MSmits: and you just make the same mistake every time
 MSmits: or at least, maybe there are only 8 variations of game or something like that. Seen it a lot
 karliso: anyway, I will have a reason to improve my bot
 MSmits: yeah, me too, but still got other things to do first
 MSmits: I want to fix my cotr and make a real solver
 jacek: cotr?
 MSmits: that bilbo optim
 jacek: bilbo optim?
 MSmits: make words
 eulerscheZahl: coders of the realm?
 MSmits: code of the ring?
 Astrobytes: Code of the rings
 eulerscheZahl: i blame Bob for reassigning that acronym
 MSmits: my current submit is done by hand
 MSmits: rank 52 with typed up solution :P
 eulerscheZahl: mine is partially by hand
 MSmits: i am guesing the loopy ones
 MSmits: guessing
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 eulerscheZahl: didn't do the last testcase by hand :D
 MSmits: I did :P
 eulerscheZahl: what score on that alone?
 MSmits: only took 3 hours or so
 MSmits: not sure, but it's pretty good
 MSmits: i thought a lot about reusing boxes and such
 MSmits: pretty sure a simple beamsearch would beat it though
 eulerscheZahl: you just have to run your code once to check :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: code?
 eulerscheZahl: hardcode
 eulerscheZahl: just execute whatever mess you caused
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: lemme check
 eulerscheZahl: and give me a number so i know if it's worth to improve that alone
 eulerscheZahl: i'm at 1393
 MSmits: ok sec
 MSmits: 1402 frames, is that the score?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: hover over that green testcase play thing
 darkhorse64: I can see how a BS could minimize the steps needed to build the strings but you will need a post process for loops
 MSmits: dont think the big testcase uses a loop anywhere
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, those loops make it hard
 MSmits: says the magic phrase is incomplete
 eulerscheZahl: testcase vs validator
 darkhorse64: Right. 
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't hardcode the test it seems
 MSmits: no just the validators
 MSmits: but the last one is identical almost
 MSmits: rigt?
 MSmits: right?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 kovi: luring of the dark side...
 eulerscheZahl: last letter is removed in the validator
 MSmits: yeah so almost
 MSmits: how do you calculate score from character count?
 MSmits: is it just the same?
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, that 1393 was an online solution
 eulerscheZahl: because i didn't find it in my book
 MSmits: the number of frames = character count
 MSmits: so 1402
 MSmits: i pasted in a text file
 darkhorse64: right on the fact that there are no loops on the last sentence. Maybe for the ring word&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 1332 on the validator
 MSmits: so my score is 1402 by hand
 MSmits: pretty nice right
 eulerscheZahl: my code is slightly better
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: also without loops
 MSmits: i just did this because I wanted to get past the quest
 eulerscheZahl: so i'm missing points somewhere else
 MSmits: but then dbdr said, why not just do a beamsearch
 MSmits: and i was like... damn 
 eulerscheZahl: but where is dbdr?
 MSmits: dunno
 Astrobytes: Still no word from him?
 eulerscheZahl: i miss you, my little prince
 MSmits: thats not creepy at all
 Astrobytes: :o
 eulerscheZahl: still running through dungeons
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: is he playing Dnd?
 Astrobytes: No...
 Astrobytes: His avatar
 eulerscheZahl: :facepalm:
 MSmits: o right
 MSmits: went woosh
 eulerscheZahl: he's gone for so long, you forgot about him
 MSmits: no no, just the pic
 Astrobytes: Hope he's OK
 MSmits: hes not been gone *that* long
 MSmits: less than a week isnt it?
 Astrobytes: No
 eulerscheZahl: much longer
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: maybe it seems shorter because i havent been that active
 MSmits: has he never been away before?
 eulerscheZahl: not for long at least
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: well i too hope he is ok, he's part of the CG furniture
 MSmits: he's the chair, you're the couch euler
 eulerscheZahl: and Automaton2000 is the old couch that no one wants to pick up even you placed it online as "free for pickup"
 Automaton2000: do you guys know how to turn it into a pastebin
 MSmits: he's the bin
 eulerscheZahl: i understood the CG survey now. they also asked companies/HR guys. not only coders
 MSmits: ah
 jacek: did they hire AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: cool
 MSmits: I think they only hire non-binary
 Astrobytes: He's here all week folks...
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 jacek: hm?
 Sentinel25B: yo
 Sentinel25B: whats up
 MSmits: enum { up = 0, .. }
 MSmits: hi&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: int[] dx = {0,1,0,-1};int[] dy = {1,0,-1,0};
 MSmits: works
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yadi.sk/i/KjYmchxEreacg">https://yadi.sk/i/KjYmchxEreacg</a>
 MSmits: I imagine if my wife didnt order all my clothes I would only be wearing stuff like that
 Astrobytes: lol, I forgot about your 'arrangement'
 MSmits: hehe yeah
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't allowed to look like a nerd? :D
 MSmits: if I pressed the issue I suppose i probably could have one nerdy day a month, if i didnt have to leave the house that day
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.getdigital.de/shop/kleidung">https://www.getdigital.de/shop/kleidung</a>for your monthly needs
 eulerscheZahl: but beware of the dryer
 MSmits: good stuff
 Astrobytes: You need the purple tentacle one MSmits
 therealbeef: tentacle looks good for winter
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: The Gandalf asymptote...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.getdigital.de/Debugging.html">https://www.getdigital.de/Debugging.html</a>i like those nonsense sentences
 Astrobytes: Facehugger scarf, now we're talking.
 Astrobytes: My favourite t-shirt currently is my "You read my t-shirt. That's enough social interaction for one day"
 jacek: so nerdy
 Astrobytes: And I didn't know it would be so apt for COVID-times when I got it.
 miklla: someone summoned me by red signals&#160;:)
 jacek: or maybe you knew it ?thinking:
 miklla: found out D&amp;B at end of december, love from first sight&#160;:)
 miklla: as TRON&#160;:)
 jacek: tron and d&amp;b? huh?
 miklla: multis
 jacek: what do they have in common
 eulerscheZahl: suum cuique
 miklla: grids and simplicity of mechanics
 jacek: 'simplicity'
 Astrobytes: you and your latin euler
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, was tortured for too long
 jacek: quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum videtur
 eulerscheZahl: also: Ich und mein deutsch :P
 jacek: schmeterrling!
 Astrobytes: charliebus sittibus on the deskinorum
 miklla: spend around 4 days for huge improvement, commited, got 100% winrate as before, nothing changed&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: "whatever is said in Latin will be seen as deep"
 jacek: miklla did you read papers on d&amp;b?
 miklla: yes
 Astrobytes: Is MSmits actually missing question time with miklla?
 jacek: lets call him. "2 3 is good opening move"
 Astrobytes: "meta mcts"
 Astrobytes: "bitboarrrrdsssss"
 reCurse: booking as p1 in uttt is viable
 jacek: eris pads her chest
 Astrobytes: He must truly be afk.
 jacek: reCurse but it is. as p2 it isnt
 reCurse: I see, you're trolling to wake him up as well
 jacek: are you gonna release chess soonish?
 reCurse: Need to write a boss for it
 reCurse: And I'm distracted with bt
 eulerscheZahl: you have random() already
 jacek: another player for bt :scream:
 reCurse: I've started training, quite a bit more resource intensive than uttt
 reCurse: Need that new cpu and gpu
 jacek: me too&#160;:(
 reCurse: Either that or I make it cloud compatible
 jacek: i wanted to replace my PC before the new ryzen, but no, "there will be new ryzen, price will drop and ill buy it then"
 reCurse: It's a good thing you waited, zen3 finally fixed bmi
 reCurse: 1000x speed increase or something
 jacek: but now i still have no bmi
 reCurse: On par with intel now
 reCurse: Ah
 jacek: but right now im gonna try those python tools for learning
 jacek: i have data and i train using my half-assed made code
 reCurse: Puck Fython
 jacek: but i need a way to efficiently compute sparse input for those :c
 reCurse: There seems to be a distinct advantage for p1 in bt so far
 reCurse: It's a shame, there's no pairing
 jacek: 5x5 and 6x5 is win for p2
 reCurse: I don't care much for fun sizes though
 reCurse: 10x increase in disk size to store training games compared to uttt lol
 jacek: is your bot alphazero style?
 reCurse: Kind of
 jacek: im too dumb for training policy
 Astrobytes: You always underestimate yourself jacek
 jacek: dunning kruger eh?
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that the opposite?
 reCurse: It's both
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: I'm here!
 MSmits: miklla are you counting chains?
 reCurse: Ping to Netherlands is crazy
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: or doing some form of nimstring analysis
 miklla: MSmits no
 miklla: actually my around 39 first moves have no meaning
 MSmits: i notice you have a particular way of placing lines early game
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: i noticed from your output that you're a few turns ahead o fme
 MSmits: sometimes it says loss
 MSmits: and then turns to win
 miklla: just not implemented euristics, make non dumb move with lowest index
 MSmits: so something happened for your bot to think i won
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: yeah i see the lines build up from the bottom up
 MSmits: lowest index checks out
 eulerscheZahl: so you were over-interpreting bot messages?
 MSmits: no, the loss thing i sreal
 MSmits: this happened around ply 45 or so
 reCurse: I still need to get around with trolling my bot messages
 miklla: these message come after ~39th move
 MSmits: and then my bot only started solving after 50
 miklla: only after*
 miklla: so they have meaning
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: when your bot says "loss" 
 MSmits: is this a certainty?
 MSmits: on perfect play?
 miklla: yes
 MSmits: interesting
 MSmits: quite early
 miklla: initially in loss position my bot was making random or lowest index move
 miklla: but now it makes kinda best losing move
 MSmits: always better to do that
 MSmits: so is this like a negamax?
 miklla: usually it can be countered by 1-3 of 30 available moves
 miklla: and it gave me nice winrate boost&#160;:)
 MSmits: or more like a statistical search with a solver
 MSmits: (like mcts solver)
 MSmits: i've been thinking of doing something with that, and improving my solving capabilities. 
 MSmits: currently i just do nimstring analysis until solved game, which basically means I start doing wel from 50-55, 38 is obviously much better
 miklla: right now I have just endgame solver, nothing random or impartial
 MSmits: does the endgame solver do score, or just win/loss?
 miklla: just endgame starts around 39-43rd move for me&#160;:)
 miklla: win/loss
 miklla: in different game
 MSmits: ah, that could make things faster for me, if i didnt bother to do score
 jacek: i dont bother either :v
 MSmits: it just looks cool to output the predicted score&#160;:)
 miklla: remi sometimes win ,e because I win in other game, but lose in real game
 MSmits: which other game?
 miklla: well known game in D&amp;B literature
 MSmits: strings and coins?  Thats basically the same game, but represented differently
 MSmits: or do you mean something else?
 miklla: nimstring if you want precise name
 MSmits: ohh i got it
 MSmits: yes sometimes you can win the nimstring and still lose on score
 MSmits: so your bot only searches nimstring?
 MSmits: so your endgame solver is a nimstring solver
 MSmits: meaning you do nimstring analysis
 miklla: y
 MSmits: good yes, this is how i beat remi, i started doing nimstring analysis
 MSmits: but not good enough apparently&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's on my list to improve this. But I will work on other things first. Thanks for sharing miklla, much appreciated
 miklla: ye, kinda boring with 100% winrate, have 7 ideas to improve my bot, waiting for losses&#160;:)
 MSmits: do what i did, make a score solver. Once your bot solves the nim-game, you got calculation time left over
 MSmits: then you can output score&#160;:)
 MSmits: will matter almost never, except sometimes vs remi
 miklla: remi is cool when he produces 2 cycles
 MSmits: yes thats how you beat someone who won the nimgame, as many loops as possible
 MSmits: but remi also gives away a lot of boxes, so he's usually already behind in score
 MSmits: i wonder if anyone else understands this :P
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up long ago when you are chatting
 MSmits: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: so i just share this post that i found while searching for the dx dy tshirt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62094">https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62094</a>
 MSmits: this is when the police finally got to you euler?
 eulerscheZahl: that's not how i looked
 dkim19375: :grinning:]
 MSmits: oh ok :P
 eulerscheZahl: i think i shared a pi of myself a while ago, didn't i?
 MSmits: you may have
 eulerscheZahl: but you didn't see or already forgot again
 MSmits: i know this was not you, but I dont remember what someone looks like from seeing 1 pic 1 time
 eulerscheZahl: me neither
 eulerscheZahl: i'm terrible with faces&#160;:(
 MSmits: i have 100+ new student faces to remember also, I think the information gets drowned out
 eulerscheZahl: one reason why i prefer a series over movies
 MSmits: I'm reasonably good with faces, but not with the names attached to them
 MSmits: so i will recognize a student years later and then not know their name
 andrecab: Hi there! in the codingame C++ ide I have two classes that need to know about each other. My problem is that the class declared at the top will not know about the one in the bottom
 eulerscheZahl: once I was like "why is this guy coming towards me" (just thinking, not saying). friend: hey, there's your dad. oops :D
 MSmits: oh, thats a different thing though, that's attention
 andrecab: normally I would use .h files but how can I solve this in CG?
 jacek: andrecab isnt that true for any c++ ide?
 MSmits: I've nearly walked by my wife and daughter several times on the street, just thinking and not registering their faces
 miklla: you can forward declare classes and use pointers
 reCurse: andrecab There is nothing special about #include files, they are literally pasted in the source file by the preprocessor.
 reCurse: So whatever they did you can do the same manually.
 MSmits: do conflicts happen often with includes?
 JBM: a bit of magic for __FILE__ and __LINE__ hough&#160;;)
 MSmits: i had it happen a few times with string
 reCurse: Define conflict
 MSmits: same name for things in different include files
 jacek: #ifndef
 MSmits: then gets pasted in
 reCurse: Only happens if you did it wrong
 MSmits: no doubt
 JBM: it's not really #include-specific either too
 JBM: you'll get naming conflicts across translation units too
 MSmits: right yeah, it's more general I guess
 andrecab: Ok, thanks for the help!
 MSmits: I had it happen with C# as well. I was using unity and tried using some basic C# libraries, apparently unity also had definitions for the same things and it caused conflict
 reCurse: And that's how namespaces were born
 reCurse: Or packages for java heretics
 MSmits: right
 JBM: or mangling
 AnalPainGiver: Why my xp's are not increasing&#160;? despite solving problem?
 eulerscheZahl: is the problem a clash?
 jacek: i feel butthurt just reading your name
 eulerscheZahl: let's engage the community&#160;:)
 reCurse: The name gave it away
 eulerscheZahl: that's the 95% we want
 JBM: i'm in bed and eZ's still active
 JBM: something's messed up
 struct: The icing on the cake will be the new feature
 MSmits: AnalPainGiver, I think you had trouble translating from Indian to English
 MSmits: it's called a hemorrhoid
 JBM: like you typed that correct on the first try
 AnalPainGiver:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean the twitter post feature struct?
 struct: yes euler
 MSmits: i google it JBM
 reCurse: He has experience
 AnalPainGiver: Dude, MSmits
 JBM: wait is that a real thing
 AnalPainGiver: what are you talking about&#160;?
 MSmits: it's your name
 JBM: what ELSE did I miss from that infamous chat
 AnalPainGiver: I just asked a generic question.
 MSmits: no no
 eulerscheZahl: and some new tile at the top announced in a few days or up to 2 weeks. wonder if those are about the same thing
 MSmits: i was responding to your name
 AnalPainGiver: Oh ok, I love doing anal to girl, that's normal!
 AnalPainGiver: If you don't, that' s on you.
 JBM: as long as she loves it too
 AnalPainGiver: True, JBM
 MSmits: uh oh, I'm out
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: the 95% of the community that we want&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol
 AnalPainGiver: Lol, you better, or something else will come out hahahha
 eulerscheZahl: i better go to bed before the urge to kick gets too strong. bye
 MSmits: gn eulerscheZahl
 AnalPainGiver: Ok,back to my ques, why my xp's are not increasing from solving clash problems
 reCurse: Ah to be 12 again and find those things funny
 Astrobytes: Oh, I go afk for a minute and get this to come back to
 JBM: as eZ intended to say
 JBM: there'x no xp for clash
 AnalPainGiver: ok, then how to increase level?
 JBM: with stuff that yields xp
 AnalPainGiver: and increase ranking?
 JBM: mostly puzzles
 AnalPainGiver: ok
 AnalPainGiver: And that I can find under which sectino?
 AnalPainGiver: section*
 JBM: but also arbitrary stuff (see xpachievement page in your profile)
 MSmits: Astrobytes this is not a typical troll, he just doesnt know the boundaries of civil communication
 Astrobytes: I know him already MSmits
 MSmits: ah ok
 AnalPainGiver: Astro, oh, so you wanted to kick me out because of my explicit explanation of my username, huh
 Astrobytes: No?
 JBM: ranking, on the other hand, is yet something completely6Wmostly orthogonal
 Astrobytes: I'll kick you out if you want but I don't care about your username right now.
 MSmits: no, it could be a hemorroid, your name was fine until it turned out it was that other thing
 AnalPainGiver: Astro, if Codingame's policy allow me to make my favorite user_id, that I mostly use every I play game. Then, It should be under filteration while making civil communication.
 Astrobytes: MSmits: haemorrhoid! Dammit
 MSmits: this time i didnt paste it off google
 MSmits: google now thinks i have issues btw
 AnalPainGiver: oh, you were referring to MSmits comment. Yeah, it's gross.. lol
 Astrobytes: Hema/Haema is US/British
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: yeah Brits always want their words longer
 JBM: i thought americans wanted their words more pedantic
 AnalPainGiver: It makes them sound like a gentleman...lol
 Astrobytes: Hematoma/Haematoma, hematemesis/haematemesis etc
 AnalPainGiver: I was having conversation with my teammate, she calls "Addi" for "Address".
 zhoubou: Astrobytes I want to thank you and everyone else for pushing me through. I scored more than 40k on Code vs Zombies :D
 zhoubou: My solution is simple and linear. I rewrote my entire code and found a lot of bugs in my sim.
 Astrobytes: Ahhh well done zhoubou!
 zhoubou: Thank you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: What's next on your list?
 zhoubou: Ughh. Haven't thought this through yet. Am thinking as we speak.
 jacek: :soccer:
 zhoubou: I thought CvZ will take me much more time
 darkhorse64: reach 100&lt;%
 darkhorse64: 100%
 zhoubou: Hmm. It might be too difficult for me
 zhoubou: At this point at least
 zhoubou: Unless someone has some easy hints&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Oh you didn't get 100%? Your work is not finished :D
 zhoubou: I don't even know how to start attaining that
 zhoubou: Unless I implement some rules, other than random movements. Or there might be an optimization I'm not seeing.
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: a bit off the current topic but do you know if leRenard wrote the Thor/GThor Othello program?
 darkhorse64: You would not believe it. My search is random (OK it's a genetic algo). Astrobytes: I don't know. Do you know his name IRL&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Sylvain
 jacek: Q.?
 Astrobytes: Author of Thor is Sylvain Quin
 Astrobytes: It was after old john mentioned it and that he worked with him back in the day, I came across the references to the old othello programs and 
 Astrobytes: *and wondered
 jacek: and yet they are beaten by the booker
 Astrobytes: leRenards first submit went to top and was almost a straight copy of his old othello program from 30 years ago so...
 struct: Also "he" wrote the book format from what I understand
 struct: and not a book
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cassio.free.fr/cassio/custom_install/database/FORMAT_WTHOR.TXT">http://cassio.free.fr/cassio/custom_install/database/FORMAT_WTHOR.TXT</a>
 Astrobytes: oui c'est correct
 Astrobytes: I mean yes, correct
 pb4: "leRenards first submit went to top and was almost a straight copy of his old othello program from 30 years ago so..."
 pb4: How do you know that&#160;?
 struct: He said so pb4
 Astrobytes: He told us at the time.
 Astrobytes: As soon as it went live he submitted.
 Astrobytes: And told us when we were amazed.
 pb4: code 30 years old&#160;?!
 pb4: Damn
 MSmits: it was cool
 reCurse: Had to write things pretty well back then
 reCurse: Shouldn't be a surprise
 Astrobytes: old john and le renard both worked together, with Michael Buro and others no less
 MSmits: It wasnt even that easy to beat renards bot. took a while
 reCurse: Who is
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 pb4: Who is Michael Buro&#160;?
 jacek: logistello programmer
 MSmits: are we doing jeopardy?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Michael_Buro">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Michael_Buro</a>
 darkhorse64: and many seminal papers on Othello
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: heh that pic looks exactly the same as our othello... of course it should, but it's still strange to see
 jacek: btw. not long ago they discovered those 'patterns' in draught community
 pb4: I see the "GLEM" paragraph on that wiki page
 Astrobytes: tric trac also has worked on... is it checkers/draughts? for decades
 reCurse: All these famous people in hiding
 jacek: which is exactly what othello did then
 Astrobytes: Hence his minimax mastery
 MSmits: ahhh, well that explains why tric trac
 MSmits: ... right
 jacek: and yet no backgammon game
 pb4: has anybody here applied something similar to that "GLEM" thing&#160;?
 Astrobytes: the tric trac game isn't straight-up backgammon afaik
 pb4: More specifically this part&#160;: "but further provides a procedure for exploring the feature space able to discover new evaluation features in a computational feasible way."
 reCurse: Ok Google, what is GLEM
 jacek: pb4 thats n-tuple
 jacek: more or less
 pb4: I'll have to spend a bit more time reading about those n-tuples
 Astrobytes: read up on MPC too
 pb4: Ok Google, what is MPC :D
 MSmits: to me it seems a lot like a NN, except you're giving it less freedom about the features it analyses
 struct: multi probcut
 Astrobytes: Sorry pb4, multi-probcut
 MSmits: multiprob cut is like cutting of branches based on probability
 MSmits: to search deeper in ab search
 MSmits: if i understand it correctly
 Astrobytes: You do the probablities offline
 MSmits: yeah the constants
 MSmits: and there are many
 Astrobytes: *probabilities
 Astrobytes: Yep
 MSmits: old john pushing me in D&amp;B
 reCurse: multi-pb4cut
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: he's online MSmits?
 MSmits: not currently, but i see him a lot in my last battles, since 2 hrs ago
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 MSmits: after i submitted
 MSmits: i think he won a lot vs me, because my bot was 100% deterministic before
 MSmits: it's got time based random seed now
 Astrobytes: Aha. Throwing him off the scent.
 reCurse: Gross
 MSmits: yeah i had a fixed seed before which won 80% vs remi, the time based seed wins only 65%
 MSmits: remi is very deterministic also... so we were mostly playing the same games with both using fixed seeds
 reCurse: This is why friends don't let friends make deterministic games
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: this is a very underestimated problem I think and one of the causes of RPS effects on leaderboards
 reCurse: Underestimated? I keep whining about it for years
 MSmits: yes, but you are an outlier
 MSmits: :P
 reCurse: Story of my life&#160;:'(
 MSmits: i noticed it mostly because of my book experimentation
 MSmits: you keep checking games to see what your bot does wrong and suddenly you recognize the same game over and over
 MSmits: games having inherent randomness (in the referee) solves this too
 reCurse: Random initial state is best
 Astrobytes: I think reCurse is more getting at starting positions etc rather than straight up random-ass games
 struct: I was gonna finish Amazons, but its also bookable to some extent
 MSmits: i agree reCurse, it is better for bot games. But people like those fixed opening state boardgames, because they are familiar and well studied
 Astrobytes: Not completely iirc. And it's worth it I think.
 reCurse: That doesn't prevent it from being randomized with openings
 Astrobytes: @Struct
 reCurse: Look at TCEC, random forced openings
 reCurse: Otherwise you'd get the same game every time
 MSmits: TCEC?
 reCurse: Computer chess championship
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: And it's applicable to any game with a fixed initial state
 MSmits: well players can do the randomness themselves
 MSmits: if the openings have equal value
 reCurse: Do pairings, force random moves, there you go
 reCurse: Extra points if you force good random moves
 reCurse: It's trivial
 reCurse: Besides if you want to compare the human elemen
 MSmits: yeah i understand the organization can force this, but the players can force it too
 reCurse: If you lose doing an opening you won't do it over and over again
 MSmits: by putting a random component into their bot
 reCurse: Unless your name is Puppey or something
 MSmits: dont understand the puppey reference :0
 reCurse: Throwaway joke
 reCurse: Don't bother explain it
 MSmits: kk
 Astrobytes: dota?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: I played dota2
 Astrobytes: Had to google but don't get the joke, haven't followed it much.
 MSmits: I think 200 games total or so
 reCurse: You know what they say about explaining jokes
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: it's the best way to learn humor!
 Astrobytes: Not always.
 MSmits: that was a joke
 MSmits: want me to explain?
 Astrobytes: 'in-jokes' make much less sense.
 MSmits: in jokes?
 MSmits: inside joke?
 Astrobytes: fml
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: yeah those are not explainable
 MSmits: until you explain the entire context
 MSmits: by that point the person is inside
 Astrobytes: getting back to not learning from losing opening moves
 Astrobytes: ...
 MSmits: what i've noticed about the deterministic games we have is not just that they are bookable
 MSmits: even if the best bots use a random component
 MSmits: the tree of "good moves' is just very small
 Astrobytes: narrow lines of play, yeah you've mentioned that a lot
 MSmits: yeah it's what i've noticed
 MSmits: so random openings helps if a game has many options
 MSmits: like chess
 MSmits: othello doesnt have that many
 MSmits: unless you force like.. the first 5 plies or so
 MSmits: maybe more
 Astrobytes: Not sure if anyone has experimented with that
 MSmits: nah i think the game is just too simple to be interesting for those contests
 MSmits: it used to be more interesting when the field was young i suppose
 MSmits: and computers were slower
 MSmits: about amazons, doesnt this game have huge branching?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: that makes it unbookable by definition, like dots and boxes
 MSmits: it would only be bookable if someone had a perfectly deterministic bot and someone else bothered to make use of that
 struct: "Also, the huge branching factor, over 1000 available legal moves during most of the opening, makes selecting good moves difficult. Still, one or two bad moves in the opening can doom a player to passive play and an almost certain loss"
 MSmits: thats a waste of time i think
 MSmits: might be worth making a multi of
 Astrobytes: It was my suggestion a long time ago
 MSmits: good one
 MSmits: yeah i remember you saying it multiple times even
 MSmits: thats when i learned about it
 Astrobytes: You remembered something someone said? You been on the nootropics? :D
 MSmits: hey i try :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 reCurse: Cute old couple aww
 MSmits: hey, dont you need to go for a walk by now
 Astrobytes: arrr shut it grandad
 reCurse: Already did
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: aw ok
 ISAAColl: hay papi
 MSmits: allright i need to go grade these christmas cards now. Want to get at least that much done before sleep
 Astrobytes: Ah the python turtle ones. Enjoy&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes, thanks and gn
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits
 zhoubou: I'm reading up on genetic algorithms. I'm wondering what the genes might hold. I'm just doing random movements, so I can only select between random movements. How can I represent that in a gene?
 jacek: MSmits there are othello 'xots'
 jacek: starting balanced openings with 8 plies
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/aboutxot.php?lang=en">http://berg.earthlingz.de/xot/aboutxot.php?lang=en</a>
 k4ng0u: zhoubou you can take an angle and a distance for instance but it highly depends on what you try to solve
 Astrobytes: CvZ k4ng0u
 Astrobytes: So just x and y in this case
 Astrobytes: @zhoubou
 darkhorse64: or radius and angle
 Astrobytes: jacek: interesting, I hadn't seen that
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: oh indeed
 zhoubou: Hmm. So a gene would be (x, y)? Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: zhoubou: see darkhorse's reply
 zhoubou: Or (r, theta), yeah
 zhoubou: But that gene is only good for a single turn.
 Astrobytes: Well you evolve your population over several turns
 Astrobytes: You keep good genes in a pool, mutate them, and cross over the best ones. Rinse and repeat.
 zhoubou: I know the gist of it, yeah.
 jacek: you do it online?
 zhoubou: What I'm not understanding is the representation of the gene/chromosome for this specific problem
 zhoubou: jacek How can I do it offline? Unless I cheat.
 Astrobytes: Just because the validators are known doesn't technically make it cheating
 Astrobytes: kovi may disagree
 jacek: mhm
 darkhorse64: It can be done online. My score is online
 AI_says_hi: darkhorse64 wait how do you train online?
 darkhorse64: ofc my code is C++ for maximum speed
 darkhorse64: I search online
 Astrobytes: Simulate multiple turns ahead and score your solutions, choose the best one
 darkhorse64: I simulate till the end
 AI_says_hi: Oh so you find suffiently good "genes" in that short time? impressive
 Astrobytes: zhoubou: your chromosome/solution is just an n sized array of moves and a score
 darkhorse64: Yes but the key is to keep on refining after the first turn, 1s is  lot of time but 50 ms matter also
 struct: My non hardcoded version was just MC
 struct: managed around 650k
 darkhorse64: The sim is not complicated so you can run a lot of them
 zhoubou: Well then I need to optimize it o.o darkhorse64
 zhoubou: I see Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: So you can mutate solutions/chromosomes and crossover 
 struct: My performance was not great there
 struct: I have like 50k games simulated on the worst test case
 struct: Hoard
 zhoubou: Online?
 struct: yes
 zhoubou: Wow..
 struct: I mean
 struct: 1 turn = 50k games 
 zhoubou: For me, it times out after 50 or so games on some test cases
 zhoubou: Lol
 struct: language?
 zhoubou: Python
 zhoubou: Around 500 for Cross (10th) test case
 zhoubou: Actually around 100 for Hoard
 struct: ok my number 40k was wrong
 struct: is less
 zhoubou: But it's much more than 100 I presume
 struct: its around 25k on turn 2
 zhoubou: Yeah..
 zhoubou: So I have a big problem
 struct: Well im using c+p+
 zhoubou: Yeah, I don't want to switch. Not yet...
 darkhorse64: Searching with Python is ... ambitious. I go 1.2 M simulations steps for test case 10 first turns
 reCurse: "A game may last theoretically up to 209 moves but, in practice, a game is generally decided before 100 moves are played."
 darkhorse64: turn
 reCurse: What is a move, 1 or 2 players
 darkhorse64: A ply, a move by one player
 jacek: as it should be
 jacek: why chess folks cant understand this
 reCurse: My current average is 150, don't know if it's a good or a bad sign
 darkhorse64: Slowly building up your advantage&#160;?
 reCurse: Or having no clue how to play
 RoboStac: this for bt?
 reCurse: Yes
 jacek: msot games are less than 100 plies
 reCurse: Yes that's what is written
 jacek: from experience
 RoboStac: when I start training the games get longer, then start to come down and are mostly below 100
 darkhorse64: You should lose very fast then. This is the issue with bt. Search happens on all the board but only far advanced pawns really matters. The winning combination get lost in the fog
 jacek: huh? when i start training my games are very short. one wrong moves and bah!
 reCurse: Problem is I have zero clue what is good play
 jacek: good play is when you winning :V
 reCurse: I did get that longer then shorter part
 reCurse: But 150 still seems like a lot
 darkhorse64: Search for Dan Troyka papers on the strategic aspects of bt. There are good tips for humans
 reCurse: Oh cool, thanks for the tip
 reCurse: Then again it's early on the training
 jacek: yeah, searching by 'breakthrough' sucks
 reCurse: ETA is currently around 12 hours to get decent number of iterations
 reCurse: sigh
 struct: How many games do you play on that time?
 reCurse: I'm at around 25k games for 30 minutes right now
 darkhorse64: You guys are making me feel like a caveman with my mcts
 jacek: mcts is so last decade
 reCurse: Would be 5 times faster if hardware was accessible
 darkhorse64: I am so last decade
 struct: Only way to get parts is to buy prebuilts it seems
 reCurse: I don't want to overspend over msrp either
 reCurse: Against my religion
 struct: Yeah, they ask for 50% more
 struct: its way too much
 reCurse: Anyone has experience setuping up cloud instances? :P
 Illedan: What are you talking about?
 Illedan: *game
 reCurse: bt
 Illedan: bt?
 reCurse: bt
 RoboStac: 25k per 30 mins should let you train something fairly quickly (it's quite a bit higher than I get and my current BT bot was less than a days training)
 Astrobytes: Breakthrough
 darkhorse64: Breakthrough
 darkhorse64: damn ankles
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 reCurse: Yeah that's hoping my hyperparameters are right
 reCurse: If not then I have to start over
 RoboStac: though obviously theres a lot more too it than just games
 RoboStac: yeah
 reCurse: I dunno maybe uttt spoiled me
 jacek: mods everywhere, i feel so insignificant
 Wontonimo: you can test or search hyperparameters
 reCurse: Sure, still need the compute to go at it fast
 Wontonimo: +1
 reCurse: I'm quite impatient when it comes to training
 reCurse: Need to write a dashboard with cute widgets to pace myself
 reCurse: Live game would be nice
 Astrobytes: You've not done that yet?
 Astrobytes: I thought you would've baked that into your framework tbh
 reCurse: No, framework requires gpu to run
 reCurse: Wasting precious resources for training
 reCurse: Even having CG open is a compromise
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 reCurse: Though I'm not sure how much is shared between cuda and 3d rendering
 ChuFta: guys please join <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1545531de3dbd549841a877ac29e9a4804c05a2">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1545531de3dbd549841a877ac29e9a4804c05a2</a>
 reCurse: But having a viewer open I notice an immediate dip in perf metrics
 reCurse: Yay pixi
 ChuFta: is there a way to start "shortest mode" clash of code which is publice??
 jacek: no
 Astrobytes: Sure. It's called Code Golf in the Compete section. No time limit but it is public.
 Astrobytes: But don't compete, just try to have fun instead.
 Astrobytes: :salt:
 Astrobytes: reCurse: your normal 'battlestation' is built on openGL or dx or?
 reCurse: opengl
 reCurse: Problem is it's realtime instead of smart updates like an oldschool gui
 reCurse: So it's running like a game, 120fps
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's gonna hit the gpu
 reCurse: Doesn't matter at all until I need 100% of my gpu
 struct: Cant you limit fps? or it doesnt matter
 Astrobytes: which is gonna be quite frequent now by the sounds of things
 reCurse: Sure but it's still going to hit the gpu
 Astrobytes: c# gui and text display for you then
 reCurse: I think I'd rather do web at this point *shudder*
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: I am so burned out with c# gui
 reCurse: A real shit show
 Astrobytes: Time for VB
 Astrobytes: But seriously, it's not nice.
 reCurse: Still not sure why UI is such a mess
 reCurse: Ok just kidding, I know why. Just wondering with all the strides made in other areas.
 Astrobytes: Guess they just gave in to web-based/pthon/java 
 reCurse: 3d rendering in 20 years is a herculean effort
 Astrobytes: *python
 reCurse: UI in 20 years?
 Astrobytes: mmm
 reCurse: Maybe effort is not the right word
 reCurse: Progress
 reCurse: There
 reCurse: 20 years later and many times I'd rather have a html page
 Astrobytes: Of course there's not just the whole experience of actually having to develop UI, but the fact the the UX/HCI field can't really keep up
 Astrobytes: Some of the traditional 'rules' still apply but with ever changing mobile device incarnations it becomes a real mess.
 Astrobytes: imo
 Illedan: Agreed on C# UI mess.. MVVM -.-
 Astrobytes: I'm not really sure a lot of people coding any kind of UI really understood anything from HCI 
 reCurse: The pre-web era windows folks were godlike tbh
 reCurse: Underappreciated how much they understood HCI
 Astrobytes: Yes, you're not wrong. There's a reason for the market dominance there.
 Astrobytes: "I'm not really sure a lot of people coding any kind of UI" + nowadays btw
 reCurse: I wouldn't mind MVVM so much if it wasn't for that goddamn abomination called WPF
 reCurse: You can put a spinning cube in a dropdown but good luck if you want to have a tab that works as expected.
 reCurse: Or something, forgot my examples, I exiled that land years ago
 Illedan: Haha, I just left that land
 Illedan: Now I'm in React
 Illedan: seems far better
 Astrobytes: But... but... WPF is so.. easy to use and quick to develop with :P
 Illedan: Bloated
 Astrobytes: No shit.
 reCurse: Obscure, overengineered
 reCurse: Unmaintained
 Illedan: Might work in Xamarin if the Functional approach gets good
 reCurse: Just stay clear from Microsoft UI frameworks
 reCurse: inb4 just stay away from microsoft lul
 Illedan: I started using Avalonia for my personal projects
 Astrobytes: What! MFC + ATL FTW!!!!
 reCurse: Avalonia looked like abandonware
 Illedan: Indeed, but it works on my windows and my mac :shrug: 
 Astrobytes: Hm, hadn't seen avalonia
 reCurse: I'd just like a minimalist ui toolkit for web
 reCurse: But form trumps function these days
 Illedan: C# webapp?
 reCurse: I have my doubts this is going to go well
 Astrobytes: the webasm thing?
 reCurse: Different things
 Illedan: Blazor
 Astrobytes: yeah I know Illedan, was just wondering which part of it reCurse was doubtful about
 reCurse: Very limited widgets it looks like
 reCurse: Sorry didn't know blazor
 Astrobytes: It's been a hot topic for some time, you really didn't hear of it?
 reCurse: I don't follow the web scene that much
 Astrobytes: Neither do I but some things you pick up through osmosis.
 reCurse: shrug
 samples32: What is the easiest practice game?
 struct: Tron might be one of the easier ones
 samples32: Thanks
 samples32: How am i expos to tell if im about to run into my light beam. P.S. Sorry for the misspelling
 Astrobytes: You have to keep a record of the cells you have visited
 samples32: Thank you Astrobytes.
 Jasperr: Is there a way to go from a clash results page to the clash contribution?
 samples32: I think you have to go to the contribute page.
 Jasperr: that shows all contributions
 Jasperr: seems like what I need is not available
 struct: Search it here
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Jasperr: if only I would remember the name of the clash
 Astrobytes: if you remember keywords you can use them
 Astrobytes: anything from the description
 Jasperr: oooh thats very useful
 Jasperr: thanks struct
 samples32: in the top left corner their is a dropdown just for that.
 struct: Today I got this clash

 Jasperr: so much broken english I had to find it to fix it
 Astrobytes: wtf struct
 struct: I understood that one
 struct: astro yeah, either someone edited statement
 struct: or I dont know
 struct: "With only numbers 1, get the highest score using only the operations +, *"
 struct: 1+1 = 2
 struct: answer for 1 should be 1
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's not clear at all
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Jasperr: lol
 Astrobytes: since you have only 1 1
 reCurse: Quality
 AI_says_hi: struct it's kinda wtf but I think what they mean is you have N ones and you can + and * until only one number is left
 struct: ah I understand now
 struct: Makes sense now
 Astrobytes: Yes but how does "With only numbers 1, get the highest score using only the operations +, *"
 Astrobytes: actually tell you that?
 AI_says_hi: Thats what I havemy crystal abll for :p
 AI_says_hi: ball*
 Astrobytes: heh
 struct: 90% of the clash is to understand the statement
 struct: 95%
 AI_says_hi: ^ TRUE
 Astrobytes: Hey, no one cares about the 5%...
 Chorizo: hi i wan't to what do i have to put in the box solution when i create a new contribution
 Chorizo: the code&#160;?

 Jasperr: calm down satan lol
 struct: Impossible to solve
 bobth: my coc room getting this
 bobth: An error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session".

 Rabeeb: rather than hardcoding it
 Smelty: actualcoder i also keep track of opponents trees, if it looks like they abt to complete than i complete
 actualCoderTrevor: wise
 Rabeeb: yeah that's good @smelty
 Rabeeb: I have that too
 Smelty: @Rabeeb i tell them to complete when i have stable sun production, day 16 is the ai
 actualCoderTrevor: I should try to come up with something like that
 Smelty: lol
 Zenoscave: aangairbender do you search?
 Wontonimo: PatrickMcGinnisII yes, trees cost is something i track.  not generate though.
 aangairbender: Zenoscave, yes, beam search. I was 140 rank without search and now 35 rank with search.
 Rabeeb: How many of u using search algo here?
 Smelty: i use scoring algo
 Rabeeb: @zeniscave wow! how deep u go?
 pmor: i just got my beamsearch working
 Smelty: kinda depth 1
 Zenoscave: How complex is your eval for beam ordering aangairbender? I use beam search
 pmor: pushes
 pmor: pushed me to silver
 Smelty: nice
 ZarthaxX: Rabeeb you dont need to @
 ZarthaxX: and tab autocompletes a name
 UndercoverToad: good morning
 ZarthaxX: HI TOAD
 Zenoscave: moin toad
 Smelty: good night
 Rabeeb: @smelty same here
 Wontonimo: morning?
 Smelty: lol
 aangairbender: its somewhat heavy I would say, e.g. I calc shadows
 UndercoverToad: 6:02am
 Rabeeb: I don't predict/lookahead opponent moves
 Smelty: 9:03 pm
 Smelty: same
 Wontonimo: no it isn't silly toad ... it's midnight
 aangairbender: hey UndercoverToad, I finally fixed my beam search
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: anybody using sets and got a custom hash function for game states? I am new to this concept and not sure how you would hash arrays
 Zenoscave: Well I mean do you have a lot of variables or just a few different considered? Mine is heavy and complex
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: any resources or tips would be appreciated
 UndercoverToad: oh great
 UndercoverToad: chromium changed the color of the top bar in an update&#160;:(
 Smelty: F
 aangairbender: nah, just sum of 4 variables, around 30 lines of code
 UndercoverToad: it's gray now. I hate changes
 Zenoscave: NotSureWhyThisWorks h = 17foreach (v in vals) { h = h*31 +v }
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: zenoscave why 17 lol
 Zenoscave: modulo largest prime less than the size of your hash table
 UndercoverToad: prime number
 Zenoscave: it's coprime to 31. 
 Zenoscave: well prime number too
 ZarthaxX: aangairbender your eval is jsut 4 vars?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh yeah that reminds me on a subject in uni years ago.
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: thanks
 aangairbender: its sum of 4 vars, two of which are current points and suns/3
 ZarthaxX: your eval is that simple?
 ZarthaxX: your code sounds super simple and effective
 Smelty: good scoring ai
 aangairbender: I just added some future evaluation related stuff to eval
 Smelty: thats the biggest part
 Zenoscave: nice aangairbender
 ZarthaxX: dude you are so beast
 ZarthaxX: great results!
 kovi: top100 is improving fast....heuristic went down from 30ish to 50ish
 Smelty: f
 aangairbender: kovi you dont have search?
 kovi: finally it works but its not in top100
 aangairbender: in game between us you completed all the trees and left the game board clear. It was perfect
 Smelty: ^
 UndercoverToad: that isn't necessarily perfect
 UndercoverToad: you can still get points for suns
 UndercoverToad: and a lvl1 is so cheap it pays back after 1 turn and you win after 2
 VizGhar: you wont from day 23 -&gt; 24
 UndercoverToad: i'm saying you should still seed at the end
 UndercoverToad: seed in day 21 =&gt; you can't complete it in time
 aangairbender: I just enjoyed watching:joy:
 VizGhar: in day 21 it makes sense21-seed22-grow for 1 sun23-earn 1 sun and shadow enemy for 1
 kovi: hmm, that was the searching one aangairbender
 Zenoscave: but in case of ties
 aangairbender: I know that extra trees could help when points are equal
 VizGhar: but not sure why after UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: then after that i still do it because i saw no reason to disallow
 UndercoverToad: search tree gets so small
 VizGhar: it is small indeed
 UndercoverToad: i allow it to happen but scoring will prevent. or place a 0 cost seed
 aangairbender: My beam search goes to day 24 every time
 Westicles: Top 7 are awful close.  Depth problem or just coincidence?
 aangairbender: I dont even bound it by time
 UndercoverToad: i run out of ideas
 UndercoverToad: debugging the tiny things already
 aangairbender: and still I eval after every action
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/552718968">https://www.codingame.com/replay/552718968</a> frame 125 I should upgrade the tree
 Zenoscave: aangairbender what is your beam width?
 Zenoscave: I can't imagine it's more than 100
 jrke: what depth is good at beam width 700?
 UndercoverToad: so I get 1 extra sun before cutting it
 aangairbender: Zenoscave, its around 50
 aangairbender: I made it dynamic to grow each day
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 ZarthaxX: wait aang, one question mhm
 ZarthaxX: you doping depth by days or by actions?
 jrke: beam width 50&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that's pretty efficient aangairbender
 aangairbender: I dont have any depth stuff, I just search while I have time, but it turns out I always finish search in 90ms, so full depth
 jrke: i am having beam width of 700 + can go to depth 9-10 but still bad eval not letting me give a better rank
 aangairbender: good eval is the hardest part imo
 VizGhar: beam width 700 doesnt even makes sense imho
 Wontonimo: why?
 Westicles: wow, my plucky wood boss is up to 290 bronze
 UndercoverToad: you have a boss?
 Wontonimo: he just is boss
 Westicles: not mine, the github one
 Zenoscave: lol
 jrke: zenoscave are you still heuristic?
 ZarthaxX: aangairbender impressive :clap:
 ZarthaxX: eval of 4 vars and that simple search
 Wontonimo: what's really impressive to me is full depth to 24th day
 Zenoscave: no
 LineBender: I calculate 1854 moves per second, but they all are wrong....&#160;:(
 Westicles: What's the dumbest thing you can do and get silver?
 UndercoverToad: go to github, copy-paste, get disqualified
 Wontonimo: random move other than wait
 Zenoscave: that is the dumbest
 Zenoscave: toad's i mean
 Wontonimo: unless all there is is wait, then wait
 Wontonimo: let me know if that works Westicles
 Westicles: Wontonimo: for silver, really?
 Westicles: surely not
 Wontonimo: well, science says try it instead of argue
 Westicles: That was the first and only thing I tried
 Westicles: It got to bronze but barely
 Wontonimo: okay okay ... try only seeding when you can see 2 squares away.  Also, don't harvest unless you have at least 6 trees total
 Zenoscave: 6 trees!?
 Zenoscave: I've been doing 3...
 Wontonimo: oh, and only seed as your last move before wait and only if you don't have any seeds out
 Westicles: will do, thanks wont
 Wontonimo: Zenoscave , i'm just throwing out stuff.  don't take notes, it isn't the golden recipe 
 Wontonimo: it should be good enough to really throw a bronze bot up to silver though.
 ClockSort: the trick to getting into silver is to be less stupid than the opponent. and that's not easy.
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 jrke: i want an eval and i am in top 100 but thats the problem from last 4 days for me&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: are you sure? the sim counts you shared sound really off. too high
 Zenoscave: who's  sim counts?
 Wontonimo: oh, Westicles, if when placing a seed, don't place it in a straight line from your seeding tree.
 jrke: Got 36491 nodes for DEPTH = 14
 jrke: beam width 700
 Zenoscave: Are you counting hashed duplicate states?
 Dakkad: Is it me or we're not getting inputs (tree data) if we wait while the opponent keeps on playing?
 jrke: i don't have hash set i made beam class in which i store states of current depth and new noded for next depth
 boi_led_egg: Players that are asleep do not receive input.
 Dakkad: Wow, thanks boi_led_egg
 boi_led_egg: rules say that
 Dakkad: That was 3 hours down the drain, because  i missed it from the rules!
 Dakkad: Thanks!
 Dakkad: "Players that are asleep do not receive input."
 Dakkad: Amazing.
 Wontonimo: like real life
 UndercoverToad: let's make a test jrke, give me a second
 Wontonimo: well, at least they are not supposed to because that's considered not giving consent 
 UndercoverToad: take the following input (i only print WAIT as legal action to keep the stderr smaller, you have to generate moves yourself)
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d404c310-58f9-44f8-8d8c-d715accc4443">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d404c310-58f9-44f8-8d8c-d715accc4443</a>
 UndercoverToad: set the depth to 3 and the beam really wide so you have no pruning. how many states?
 jrke: one min lemme test it
 UndercoverToad: depth=3 means 3 days in my definition
 jrke: in my definition its 3 turns
 jrke: i didn't get your input format
 UndercoverToad: that's a problem I think
 jrke: what are those -1 for
 UndercoverToad: WAIT gives you suns and is a great action if your prune by actions instead of days
 UndercoverToad: the -1 is the referee input. no neighbor for the cell
 UndercoverToad: I get 6920 visited states btw (might include a few duplicates as I count before removal)
 aangairbender: let me als otry that
 Zenoscave: I got 359...
 UndercoverToad: i'm counting everything, not just leafs
 Zenoscave: same
 Zenoscave: Removed my pruning. 1682
 UndercoverToad: 1732 leaf nodes after 3 days for me
 UndercoverToad: at least one of us is wrong
 aangairbender: what that's without truncating the beam?
 UndercoverToad: yes, no pruning for those numbers
 UndercoverToad: but removign duplicates for the 1732
 Zenoscave: No pruning no hashing so even with duplicate and internal nodes i only visit 1682
 Zenoscave: I have a bug for sure
 aangairbender: I have 81 lol
 aangairbender: you really can do 2k moves on day 3?
 UndercoverToad: move combinations
 UndercoverToad: leading to distinct states
 aangairbender: I dont seed from size 1 tree, that cuts some states
 UndercoverToad: e.g. 1 state is the result ofSEED 24 25|WAIT|GROW 25|WAIT|GROW 25|SEED 36 7|WAIT
 UndercoverToad: let me test without SEED
 UndercoverToad: for size 1
 aangairbender: my bot wants toWAIT | GROW 24 | WAIT | WAIT |
 VizGhar: and you make 1732 full days as nodes UndercoverToad? pretty nice
 VizGhar: I make about 2000 actions&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: I get 81 visits after 2 days then
 jrke: Got 200 nodes for DEPTH = 3 for 3 turns there are exactly 200 possible states can be same also
 UndercoverToad: and 837 leafs after 3
 aangairbender: UndercoverToad how can your bot SEED on turn 1? it doesnt have enough suns
 Wontonimo: you can see for free
 Wontonimo: if you have no seeds
 Marchete: :eyes:
 jrke: To perform a seed action, you must pay sun points equal to the number of seeds (size 0 trees) you already own in the forest.
 UndercoverToad: and I shared a state where you have 2 suns already
 aangairbender: hey Marchete, I have beam search working now
 Marchete: noice
 Marchete: when no 1?
 aangairbender: UndercoverToad idk how my bot works then:joy:
 UndercoverToad: no one?
 Marchete: number 1
 jrke: euler i am getting 200 nodes for depth 3 there are max 200 states for 3 turns
 UndercoverToad: me? never&#160;:(
 Marchete: that's the spirit
 UndercoverToad: as Automaton said: "eulerscheZahl is a noob :D"
 Marchete: how much wisdom in such little bits
 Marchete: :D
 aangairbender: euler my search finds 1864 in 3 days
 jrke: and the state you have shared euler is having 8 valid moves at root depth
 aangairbender: I removed not seeding from size 1 tree
 UndercoverToad: terminal nodes? similar to mine then
 aangairbender: its total amount, not terminal
 UndercoverToad: hm
 UndercoverToad: then I have duplicates or you are missing some
 aangairbender: 1696 terminal states
 UndercoverToad: 1732 terminals for me
 UndercoverToad: close enough :P
 aangairbender: my hashing stuff is automatic, so I am pretty sure there is no terminals
 UndercoverToad: you mean no duplicates?
 UndercoverToad: same for me, .net library does that
 aangairbender: hmm, this is interesting
 aangairbender: lets try 2 days
 UndercoverToad: jrke 06:52AMand the state you have shared euler is having 8 valid moves at root depth
 UndercoverToad: 2 days =&gt; 139 terminal nodes
 aangairbender: I have 152 for 2 days
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83613ba1-ec5b-4063-b069-76d55ab1699c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83613ba1-ec5b-4063-b069-76d55ab1699c</a>
 aangairbender: and 16 for 1 day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: see game of 256 total points
 aangairbender: try 1 day:sweat_smile:
 UndercoverToad: 20 :D
 pmor: maybe I missed something, but do you ignore the other player moves to be able to condense the actions per action into actions per day?
 aangairbender: print those please, I will print mine
 pmor: actions per turn
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7ab5072-f0c4-4c95-b5b2-2e17d9a2d19b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7ab5072-f0c4-4c95-b5b2-2e17d9a2d19b</a>
 UndercoverToad: and pmor we both talk about single player with a waiting opponent
 pmor: Ah, ok..
 pmor: makes sense now..thanks
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/552718968">https://www.codingame.com/replay/552718968</a>visuals for the state btw, frame 2
 UndercoverToad: uhm, where is SEED 36 18 in my actions? :scream:
 aangairbender: I didnt seed if I had a seed already
 aangairbender: now I have 40 states for day 1
 aangairbender: :joy:
 supershah: how to show messages in game?
 UndercoverToad: action message
 UndercoverToad: just with a space between
 supershah: ohh print action command?
 supershah: got it
 aangairbender: how do you share a pastebin?
 jrke: uhm, where is SEED 36 18 in my actions?  same in mine can't see that
 UndercoverToad: do you remove duplicates for SEED a b|SEED c dvs SEED c d|SEED a b&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: paste it here
 UndercoverToad: will convert if long enough
 aangairbender: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/774a1440-fe54-4fb7-b066-bccf73fa3c21">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/774a1440-fe54-4fb7-b066-bccf73fa3c21</a>
 UndercoverToad: that's 20 actions like mine
 UndercoverToad: also no 36 18
 UndercoverToad: oh wait, stupid me
 aangairbender: why 36 18 is missing
 UndercoverToad: there is no 36 18 as that's blocked
 UndercoverToad: looking at the wrong replay
 Marchete: :expressionless:
 UndercoverToad: i copied turn 1 input but not the board
 aangairbender: richness 0 you mean?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 jrke: these are the valid actions i am getting euler
 jrke: 8
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94cfbc03-5a6b-40c3-a06e-c953e44b3de9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94cfbc03-5a6b-40c3-a06e-c953e44b3de9</a>
 UndercoverToad: same jrke. now count actions for the full day
 UndercoverToad: so we agree on 20 terminal states after 1 day
 UndercoverToad: @aangairbender
 UndercoverToad: then to day 2, i shared the list above
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83613ba1-ec5b-4063-b069-76d55ab1699c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83613ba1-ec5b-4063-b069-76d55ab1699c</a>
 UndercoverToad: 139 lines
 aangairbender: I have this stats nowD 1 20D 2 259D 3 3380
 aangairbender: btw idk why my hashset size was 40

 aangairbender: ^ my states for day 2
 aangairbender: its hard to compare, maybe we could try with 1 tree on the board only
 jrke: mine for 1 day i mean till 1st wait
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e86e541-44d7-4aa6-b5b3-7d75ec9003c6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e86e541-44d7-4aa6-b5b3-7d75ec9003c6</a>
 Marchete: on beamsearch why it's better to work with days and not turns?
 Nerchio: for my beamsearch it seems to made no difference or made it worse so removed it for now
 UndercoverToad: I don't find this line of yours: SEED 24 10|WAIT|GROW 10|SEED 24 11|WAIT
 UndercoverToad: jrke there are more ways to have 2 seed actions
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/90e818c0-4e26-4dcb-a12f-2700a8d6e5bb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/90e818c0-4e26-4dcb-a12f-2700a8d6e5bb</a>
 aangairbender: euler that sequence look ok
 UndercoverToad: i know, i am wrong here
 Marchete: SEED 24 10|SEED 36 7|WAIT|SEED 36 7|SEED 24 10|WAIT|
 Marchete: is filtered by the hash, no?
 UndercoverToad: yes, should be filtered
 aangairbender: same state so should be filtered
 jrke: i am using hash
 jrke: not*
 UndercoverToad: fix it
 aangairbender: euler maybe you are not making some bad moves intentionally?
 UndercoverToad: i want to generate all moves, must be a bug
 UndercoverToad: i'll check after breakfast
 aangairbender: you dont restore dormant state for size=0 trees
 aangairbender: at least it seems so
 aangairbender: oh, you have SEED 36 7|WAIT|GROW 7|WAITso its not it
 NinjaDoggy: pointless to generate all seed options :P
 jrke: does that means my sim is bug free?
 NinjaDoggy: what if you debug it for a long time just to find out it's a hash collision&#160;;)
 jrke: i don't use hash yet
 NinjaDoggy: yea @toad
 jrke: which is faster * or &amp; in cpp
 pmor: i would say, it depends.
 actualCoderTrevor: If they aren't overridden I would think * is never faster
 UndercoverToad: hash collisions don't matter as there's still an Equals() function to do a real check
 NinjaDoggy: true but you do that?
 NinjaDoggy: isn't that super slow D:
 UndercoverToad: jrke removing duplicates is crucialimagine you have a good sequence which you store as often as your beam is wide, just in different order
 UndercoverToad: of course I do it
 jrke: can i save a default class in hash?
 NinjaDoggy: do you keep the equals() whole contest?
 aCat: so you just use standard c# structures&#160;? hashset or whatever?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 NinjaDoggy: like if you use a large enough mod, isn't the collision rate so low it doesn't matter?
 aCat: not some my-own-mambo-jumbo transpozition table
 NinjaDoggy: :joy:
 Marchete: a good hash must have a very low collision
 UndercoverToad: i don't have such a mambo-jabmo thing
 jrke: how a hash identifies that state is equal do we have to code something for that also
 jrke:&#160;?
 Ximvu: It's generally a tradeoff between collision rate and memory usage.
 NinjaDoggy: not even memory usage though...
 jrke: suppose if there states are same but there root moves are different then how a hash will identify them as equal
 NinjaDoggy: you generate a key(64 bit int) and just compare the key for equality
 NinjaDoggy: instead of comparing the actual states for equality because chances of 2 states generating the same key is super duper low
 NinjaDoggy: if you use 64 bits
 Marchete: I agree
 NinjaDoggy: something about birthday paradox and you can have sqrt(size) elements before expecting a collision :P
 Marchete: I'm trying to use zobrist (I xor changes and not the whole gamestate each simulation)
 NinjaDoggy: idk i don't do math :P
 NinjaDoggy: is zobrist worth it though? there's like a total of 10 variables in a state
 Marchete: imo use murmurhash / zobrist or anything proven
 Marchete: not a invented one
 UndercoverToad: now I get 181 states&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: thanks euler fixed a bug with your debugs
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 NinjaDoggy: the helpful toad euler
 Marchete: " non-cryptographic hash function"
 jrke: looks my gameenigine bug free just i need a better eval but ....
 VizGhar: tnx Marchete for new terms...
 UndercoverToad: aangairbender you have these 2 lines:
 UndercoverToad: SEED 24 11|WAIT|SEED 24 23|GROW 11|WAITSEED 24 11|WAIT|GROW 11|SEED 24 23|WAIT
 Marchete: :D
 NinjaDoggy: Marchete which one is better?
 UndercoverToad: so all of us could improve the engine :D
 aangairbender: That is weird
 Marchete: ninja, zobrist is good for big gamestates with little changes each turn
 aangairbender: these actions lead to the same state, dont they?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: that's why I say you have a bug
 Marchete: mumurhash is more general
 NinjaDoggy: if i have 15 variables for my state
 NinjaDoggy: is zobrist worth?
 UndercoverToad: depends on how many change
 NinjaDoggy: wait nvm dumb question
 UndercoverToad: and what state size they have
 UndercoverToad: when 1 var can have 100 values it's reasonable with zobrist. for 1 million possible values it isn't
 Marchete: 			Hash ^= Zobrist.TREE_SIZE[cellIDX, treeLevel];			Hash ^= Zobrist.TREE_SIZE[cellIDX, treeLevel + 1];
 Marchete: this is for example a tree size change
 NinjaDoggy: ah I see
 NinjaDoggy: you're not bitboarding&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: or the example isn't i guess
 Marchete:&#160;??
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74d8df66-d055-417d-a2b4-498ee2263d3c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74d8df66-d055-417d-a2b4-498ee2263d3c</a>
 Marchete: this is the grow
 UndercoverToad: but how to get there:
 UndercoverToad: int cellIDX
 UndercoverToad: that's an extra step already if you use bitboards
 Marchete: I don't understand that
 Marchete: my movegen gives cellIDX
 Marchete: cellIDX as bit index
 NinjaDoggy: yea nvm it's good
 Marchete: not CG_index
 NinjaDoggy: bitboard to generate moves
 aangairbender: eulerSEED 24 11|WAIT|SEED 24 23|GROW 11|WAITSEED 24 11|WAIT|GROW 11|SEED 24 23|WAITthose 2 actions have different sun cost
 NinjaDoggy: and then the hash is updated as if the board was storing the individual bits
 Marchete: any gamestate change == bitboard + hash change
 NinjaDoggy: separately :thumbsup:
 aangairbender: If you seed before growing it takes 1 more sun
 Marchete: you need to check if that's better or maybe murmuhash(byte[])
 Marchete: I'd do it eventually
 NinjaDoggy: do I just use the implementation here:
 NinjaDoggy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/">https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/</a>
 Marchete: I guess so
 Marchete: just make some simple tests
 UndercoverToad: good point aangairbender
 UndercoverToad: now I remember, I don't even generate such wasteful states
 Marchete: but you actively do that UndercoverToad
 Marchete: or you rely on beamsearch to prune these
 Marchete: ah nvm
 Marchete: you already asked
 aangairbender: that's why I usually dont seed when I alaready have one
 jrke: i print shadow like this
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64b7ea24-f53d-47a9-909d-da2f71d1553c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64b7ea24-f53d-47a9-909d-da2f71d1553c</a>
 aangairbender: I just commented that code for this test
 UndercoverToad: &gt; you already askedyou mean answered?
 Marchete: ohh beautiful print
 NinjaDoggy: :O the mapping :O
 Marchete: you should share this :D
 aangairbender: gtg, have fun guys
 UndercoverToad: bye, see you
 UndercoverToad: and thanks for helping be debug
 Nerchio: today gold opens right :D
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: before you ask: 6pm
 aCat: morning Nerchio
 NinjaDoggy: 6pm what? D:
 UndercoverToad: CEST
 UndercoverToad: in 10h 11min
 UndercoverToad: approximately
 NinjaDoggy: thx&#160;:)
 KCrown: whats thw cut off for gold?
 UndercoverToad: that's in the decision of CodinGame
 UndercoverToad: probably around 300
 UndercoverToad: and 10-15 for legend
 jrke: i want good eval :head_bandage:
 Nerchio: hello aCat :P
 jrke: finding from 4 days but every time i fail
 Kolo9: do only ~15 people really make it to legend? or just mean in terms of leaderboard today?
 Kolo9: haven't gotten into the contests for a while but I thought legend is a couple hundred at least?
 UndercoverToad: 15 people on league opening is the norm
 jrke: opening window for legend is top 15-17 then it increases as time passes
 Kolo9: ahh cool thanks
 UndercoverToad: but in the end it will be more, competition really gets stronger on the last weekend
 UndercoverToad: but i disagree with "a couple hundred", it will be around 100 in the end
 UndercoverToad: sometimes a bit more (mostly on heuristic games) or less (simulation based games)
 Kolo9: :thumbsup:
 jrke: was 79 or 89 in fall challenge at end
 NinjaDoggy: since murmur hash generates a 32 bit output, can I just get 2 of them(with different seeds) and mash them together?
 NinjaDoggy: or will generating the 128 bit version be faster?
 UndercoverToad: *looks it up* 80 legend players in last contest

 Marchete: from your link
 NinjaDoggy: actually yea i'm stressing over optimal hashing speed too much lol
 NinjaDoggy: should just take this implementation and roll with it
 NinjaDoggy: much more gains to be found elsewhere in my spagetti code XD
 Marchete: it's more about hash quality+performance
 Marchete: a homebrew hash can have more collisions
 morefood: hello world
 NinjaDoggy: :thumbsup:

 pmor: you just keep calling hash::combine(seed, value, value2, value 3
 Shivzee: import random
 Shivzee: :laughing:
 UndercoverToad: i hate it when fixing a bug makes the bot worse&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: it should honestly be illegal&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: now i get more states. when makes it harder for my beam not to prune the good ones
 UndercoverToad: which makes*
 NinjaDoggy: just aggressively prune seed moves during generation&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: i can give it a try
 UndercoverToad: like no seed to direct neighbors
 NinjaDoggy: I think you can be more aggressive :rage:
 NinjaDoggy: like no seeding unless it's free
 UndercoverToad: wow, that's a great idea :unside_down:
 UndercoverToad: :upside_down:
 Marchete: maybe just direct neighbors on current seed direction
 Marchete: sun*
 UndercoverToad: the effect will be very minor anyways
 NinjaDoggy: is upside_down: supposed to be sarcastic? ._.
 UndercoverToad: in this context: yes
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: i don't know what the actual meaning of that emoji is
 UndercoverToad: the seed target will only matter in the first few rounds
 pmor: its a smiling aussie
 UndercoverToad: when more trees you can still spawn there starting from other trees

 VizGhar: UndercoverToad are you using any of those hashing things? (zobrist)
 VizGhar: Heard about it first time and it looks powerful
 UndercoverToad: not for this game
 solistice: are there any basic tips for heuristics? Math wise? Like making sure that values are normalized and so on? I can't seem to figure out something remotely correct
 kovi: my bs reached the level of heuristical
 UndercoverToad: but easier to extend and improve, isn't it?
 kovi: i'm not yet sure how to add those heuristics, and if they can improve anything

 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Has anybody got the error: "provided invalid input. Expected 'SEED &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt; | GROW &lt;idx&gt; | COMPLETE &lt;idx&gt; | WAIT'Got <i> "</i>
 boi_led_egg: no, but seems you didn't provide any actions
 boi_led_egg: print("SEED 1 2") or something
 aCat: or maybe you put a newline in your print
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: this is different to not printing anything right? I recall the error is a timeout if you don't print at all
 aCat: (and part of it went to the next line)
 aCat: yes
 boi_led_egg: yeah, seems your print is wrong
 aCat: not printing gives timeout
 aCat: you  printed space it seems
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok, I'll try debug thanks
 jrke: not printing or even printing invalid command or typos
 solistice: Not printing gives "xxx did not provide a valid action in time", no?
 solistice: so probably printing something unexpected
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I found I was printing a value that was only declared but not defined

 raxkin: Gold league unlock at same time as silver one?
 UndercoverToad: yes, in 9h
 Nerchio: i think i had a bug in almost every part of my evaluation lol
 Nerchio: not even sim
 solistice: haha same, I'm struggling with the cloning of the state
 solistice: nothing matches anymore
 dbdr: my eval went from total crap to 2/3 crap yesterday
 dbdr: I need to continue...
 Zanoshky: How do you ask your code to go N depth for each possible actions. Lets say next 3 moves, and get the best node after each state players 3 moves?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: dbdr do you consider all possible seed moves in your search?
 dbdr: Zanoshky you can stop at a certain day. or when time runs out
 Raptcha: any ideas on mars lander 2?
 Nerchio: dbdr what the hell you are 1st :D
 Nerchio: and you say your eval is crap
 UndercoverToad: first on Wednesday
 UndercoverToad: to quote re Curse: 1st on Wednesday is 50th in the end
 Nerchio: sure but if his eval is bad then what mine is :unamused:
 dbdr: UndercoverToad only I'm a bit worried how much more depth there is in this game
 UndercoverToad: same
 dbdr: seems a bit too simple
 UndercoverToad: thank god it's not a 1 month contest
 dbdr: lol
 aCat: :D
 dbdr: i loved the 1 month format for locam btw&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: IT
 UndercoverToad: WAS
 aCat: I loved it for OOC
 UndercoverToad: NOT
 dbdr: taking it easy
 UndercoverToad: ACAT'S
 UndercoverToad: IDEA
 UndercoverToad: as he told me once like that
 dbdr: 1 month OOC?
 Astrobytes: GOOD MORNING TOAD
 aCat: yeah true
 jrke: i am paniced paniced paniced no eval for me&#160;:(
 aCat: but still I think monthly contests have their merits
 UndercoverToad: 1 month locam was not aCat's idea. just CG trying something
 Astrobytes: stop panicking
 dbdr: fn eval() return random() }
 UndercoverToad: for OoC the month was better suited than locam I think
 aCat: yep
 Astrobytes: Yes, I agree with that
 aCat: less meta
 dbdr: wait, was OOC really a month?
 UndercoverToad: 4 weeks
 aCat: agree with all hands
 Astrobytes: Yep
 MateoS: I dynamically set value of a variable: position 2500/2700
 UndercoverToad: also good morning astro
 MateoS: I set it to "1": position 900/2700
 MateoS: coding...
 dbdr: did I miss three of those weeks then? :thinking:
 UndercoverToad: so OoC was so deep it didn't even feel like a month?
 dbdr: I remember OOC as a normal contest
 Astrobytes: lol
 UndercoverToad: you got an early lead dbdr
 UndercoverToad: you and kov i
 dbdr: in OOC?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 dbdr: must be a different dbdr then

 dbdr: 9th is a lead?
 <b>**dbdr got spoiled by sc21</b></p><p><img src="/a/63686149173768" /> UndercoverToad: high rank at least
 dbdr: true
 dbdr: in my early contests I was much slower. got decent ranks in the later part only
 dbdr: experience definitely helps a lot
 UndercoverToad: in my first contests i often got a #1 spot on day 1 or 2
 UndercoverToad: not i learned that it's a marathon and not a sprint
 UndercoverToad: early lead is worthless you don't design your code properly and drop later on
 dbdr: #talent
 dbdr: might give you good intuitions about heuristics, eval, which can also make the difference later
 jrke: wooo dbdr congrats running first
 dbdr: thanks jrke
 dbdr: I changed a false to true, went back from #8 to #1
 jrke:  also can be in top 100 if i got an eval that works
 jrke: lol
 dbdr: that run I lost my first match against #80 or so, so I first thought the change is bad
 UndercoverToad: the game is surprisingly consistent, there losses are extremely rare
 jrke: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 Nerchio: its true, i consistently lose to everyone
 jrke: from last 10 mins i am getting that

 Di_Masta: Hi, did someone come up with a good idea when to complete trees in the contest game, for a heuristic bot!?
 Di_Masta: I've tried several ones but none is working  well (complte every time when I have sun; complete when I have more trees than the opponent; ...)
 UndercoverToad: i still have no idea if i'm choosing a good moment
 Astrobytes: Have you tried completing later in the game?
 UndercoverToad: who?
 AntiSquid: tree completion requires some indepth analysis, train an NN for it
 Astrobytes: Di_Masta
 AntiSquid: just that . 0 or 1 output for whether it's the right time to complete :D
 Di_Masta: hm I haven't will do, I'm implementing MCTS but I want a nice bot for the playouts
 actualCoderTrevor: Di_Masta my bot completes any time a tree is expected to cause me to get a negative net sun points by shading my own trees versus shading my opponents trees in the future
 solistice: Can someone with some prior experience help me to get me started with the heuristics? It's baffling me
 solistice: Btw, the #fr opens by default, can I change that in some way?
 Di_Masta: @actualCoderTrevor sounds nice
 actualCoderTrevor: Yeah it wasn't a trivial calculation though. I probably should've focused on simming. Oh well.
 actualCoderTrevor: solistice I don't mean to ignore you but not sure what advice to give. Start with interpreting the valid moves you're given and play with some formulas for choosing the best one
 AntiSquid: you can change your location solistice
 actualCoderTrevor: Then watch the replays and see what your bot does that's stupid or doesn't do that's obvious and program that behavior in
 Nerchio: lol solistice doesn't want to see fr chat :D
 Zenkov: a
 AntiSquid: well imagine you get defaulted to RU chat but don't speak russian
 Nerchio: that makes a lot of sense :thinking: although we could probably talk a little bit
 actualCoderTrevor: From here I can a) Tweak my heuristics and fill in some of my TODOs, b) Get back to simming and start some kind of search implementation or c) Add more dialogue to my bot. What would be the most productive?
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh or d) start some kind of offline battle arena
 Nerchio: c sounds best tbh
 Astrobytes: lol
 Nerchio: will give you the best results for sure
 actualCoderTrevor: That was my feeling as well. It will be good to motivate me to keep working.
 actualCoderTrevor: It's also what I've put the most thought into.
 AntiSquid: c  takes least amount of time
 AntiSquid: you can meanwhile think what to do next
 actualCoderTrevor: Good point
 2kiran: is anyone there!
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/552965125">https://www.codingame.com/replay/552965125</a>that's a completely different play style :o
 UndercoverToad: and it's somehow working
 Nerchio: my bot does that sometimes
 ddreams: have seen a few that get a lot of sun points
 UndercoverToad: but not in the top ranks
 Nerchio: but yeah.. sometimes loses because of late completion so
 ddreams: game depth++
 Nerchio: i dont think its optimal
 RoboStac: he doesn't always do it either
 Nerchio: it feels like a backup plan when you fall behind :p
 Nerchio: with completing trees
 Mannava_Goblin7: #clash
 VizGhar: I'm counting just earnings and my beam is cutting down the trees... i don't get it

 UndercoverToad: you have to give a reward for still having a tree that you could cut later
 Whatar: guys any idea on whats the percentage of silver bots that will be automatically promoted to gold once its out?
 AntiSquid: hard to tell :P
 AntiSquid: i go with 25%
 Whatar: thanks

 ddreams: what bug?
 ddreams: (trying to invite hints) :p
 dbdr: a bug in a secret feature&#160;;)
 ddreams: ooh
 Nerchio: time to fall 20 places after you fix it
 dbdr: that's not the point
 dbdr: Nerchio, it's the kind of case where that could definitely happen

 ddreams: so in december, gotcha
 Chainman: yep, American date times lalalal
 ddreams: iso8601 &lt;3
 AntiSquid: why is the month before the day anyway? :D
 UndercoverToad: why is the year *not* in front?
 UndercoverToad: much easier to sort with yyyymmdd

 UndercoverToad: because I have a lot to say
 UndercoverToad: you'd better listen
 jrke: damn no better till now&#160;:(
 Michael_Howard: I do&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: not big enough to be cut off
 UndercoverToad: OoC had a bug where you could make the whole replay laggy by printing too much
 AntiSquid: hm maybe it's just me?
 AntiSquid: his speech bubbles don't show text for me
 UndercoverToad: the SDK has as way to limit the size in pixels. text will just end with ... if too long
 UndercoverToad: but it's removing 1 char, rendering to see if it fits and so on
 UndercoverToad: that rendering over and over takes some time if you print a whole novel.

 Michael_Howard: Never mind my bot - it was seeding where it's more expensive &amp; crowded. :dizzy_face:
 Michael_Howard: Watch out for those + &amp; - signs kids! 
 UndercoverToad: :D
 AntiSquid: had this tab open for days, wonder when it will break
 UndercoverToad: don't you turn off your computer?
 AntiSquid: suspend
 aldrinm: yea. got into silver&#160;!
 AntiSquid: got past a wall of few thousands just to face another wall of few thousands? congratulations&#160;! :D
 Nerchio: so will we get 1000 gold players before legend opens?
 AntiSquid: i assume so
 Ajaiy2: After looking at the original game, I think there would be different types of trees at gold
 AntiSquid: no
 cegprakash: aldrinm welcome to the zombie island.. everyone are zombies here eating each other alive
 Ajaiy2: Why not, AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: why yes? Ajaiy2
 Ajaiy2: Its just a guess, what do you think though?
 AntiSquid: i told you no.
 Hoggins: Rule change will be a disaster. This means all previous work should be thrown away. Competition can be shorter if that was their plan
 AntiSquid: hm, usually statement would tell you from bronze on: no more rule changes
 AntiSquid: not anymore
 Ajaiy2: Why are you being so dramatic, Hoggins? You're scaring me
 AntiSquid: scaring?&#160;:/
 Ajaiy2: Because I wrote 285 lines of code and I wouldn't have the heart to just dispose it.
 Hoggins: just imagine how much code was created by other 5k ppl - this can be a huge book
 AntiSquid: Ajaiy2, he is saying that's what a rule change does, forces you to dispose of your code and start over
 AntiSquid: 285 isn't much
 Ajaiy2: Well, I am adding more
 Ajaiy2: That's why
 FatIvan: I would be surprised at new rules in gold with no new rules in silver. I am surprised that they allow actions to take place in the shade though, that was the biggest departure from the board game.
 FatIvan: Thought that might have come in when silver opened but it didn't.
 AntiSquid: sounds like an annoying rule, no actions in shade
 FatIvan: It's a major part of the strategy in the board game. Even if someone gets a valuable hex you can block them from growing by shading them.
 Nerchio: i mean that would almost trivialize the game i think very few actions then
 Nerchio: but more opponent interaction perhaps
 AntiSquid: game might have been better that way, i don't know .
 Ajaiy2: They better add a new variable which shows if a tree is spooked
 FatIvan: You certainly don't grow as many trees in the board game.
 AntiSquid: you can add that yourself Ajaiy2
 AntiSquid: i see FatIvan, the board game sounds more strategical
 actualCoderTrevor: I would like to see more days so a winning strategy is better differentiated from a losing one.
 AntiSquid: maybe it's changed to explode possible states :D
 FatIvan: Definitely a different pace. Becomes very busy with 4 players too.
 Ajaiy2: Maybe you can chop down opponent's trees
 cegprakash: we can do that?
 aldrinm: are there rules changes expected or is everybody just speculating&#160;?
 AntiSquid: wouldn't 4 player be very random&#160;?
 Ajaiy2: Imagine winning against 3 AIs
 cegprakash: 17 wins in first 18 games? is this a dream?
 FatIvan: I think 4 players would be messy for the contest but it is fun on the table top.
 actualCoderTrevor: aldrinm just speculating. I've heard many times here that rules won't change.
 AntiSquid: the board game is also in turns right&#160;? FatIvan
 aldrinm: ok. makes sense. else that would mean going back to the drawing board
 Ajaiy2: I think we can have some kind of powerups at gold. I mean, how cool would that be?
 FatIvan: Yes, with each player taking all of their actions for the turn before passing to the next.
 aldrinm: if they were to change rules, then adding a new variable makes more sense than changing an existing one. so powerups would be nice
 FatIvan: There is a rotation of which player goes first each turn.
 AntiSquid: sounds you'd be really happy if you made a bot for an actual game Ajaiy2
 Ajaiy2: Yeah, I'm also on game development
 AntiSquid: CG tries to keep games simple also rule changes won't happen at this point
 AntiSquid: maybe after contest if people demand it, but i don't see it
 AntiSquid: also rule changes break bots so VERY unlikely to happen
 AntiSquid: this isn't general game ai arena :P
 cegprakash: AntiSquid true.. I'd love to see a higher initial nutrition for late game battle.. but that can break so many bots in top
 cegprakash: so it's not fair to change rules
 Michael_Howard: They won't change rules, but if they did, they'd give notice &amp; put it in the Gold intro that rules will change in Legend.
 AntiSquid: don't ping me, i don't demand changes
 dbdr: I am pushing you hard UndercoverToad

 solistice: which hash functions you guys using?
 AntiSquid: i don't get it, did you 3D print that actualCoderTrevor&#160;?
 actualCoderTrevor: No it's a model kit
 UndercoverToad: do that before legend opens dbdr
 dbdr: noted
 AntiSquid: what do you use it for
 actualCoderTrevor: You just put it together. It's displayed proudly on one of my shelves right now
 LLG: I'm probably gonna redo my entire eval later today
 LLG: it's both slow and inaccurate
 LLG: I changed a coefficient and now my bot is holding 100 sun til the end of the game lol
 UndercoverToad: in plants vs zombies this would be a good thing
 Westicles: They've made unexpected rule changes before to fix things.  There was that one where the first player had turned out to have a small advantage
 ddreams: doesn't one of the players here have an advantage?
 UndercoverToad: i think the upper player has because of who gets shadow first
 Michael_Howard: Surely they could fix that in the seed generator without changing the rules.
 dbdr: how?
 Michael_Howard: if coinFlip() { swapStartingPositions() }
 dbdr: it's already random
 ddreams: I think the only way to fix it would be to battle both sides each time
 dbdr: agreed, then add scores
 ddreams: no, that wouldn't be correct
 ddreams: or, it'd be a different game
 elijah.toppo: My algorithm is taking too long, any idea how to preempt running in python?
 dbdr: it would be a fairer game
 ddreams: maximizing own score vs. making sure you're beating your opponent
 dbdr: if you just count win/loss, with swap you will get too many draws
 ddreams: count score as tiebreaker then
 dbdr: that's exactly the same
 dbdr: if you lose twice you cannot have higher score
 ddreams: true dat

 AntiSquid: less headaches
 KalamariKing: I know HOW to bitboard, I just wanna know how feasible it is for this contest, and what bitboards in all you use
 ZarthaxX: it makes stuff easier to calculate honestly
 KalamariKing: And how do you select the nth bit? As far as I've gotten is bit-shifting the bitboard n times to the right and bitwise-'and'ing 0x00...01
 Queuebee: do you have a bitboard for each type of tile/tree (per player)/shadow&#160;? or can it be squished into one? and is it then possible to translate something like SEED x y into some crazy 1 operation on the board?
 AntiSquid: lots of things can be done
 Queuebee: Does a solution from top 1000 people usually get revealed at the end?
 KalamariKing: If not do people usually publish their code
 ddreams: many top players post postmortems
 DomiKo: but we don't share code
 Queuebee: but the postmortems are too hard for me to grasp :disappointed:
 <b>**Queuebee goes back to lurking</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: How would you expect to understand full code then?
 ddreams: Practice practice
 Queuebee: by connecting the words in post mortem to the code, I guess
 struct: sharing top code ruins the game
 Astrobytes: But how would you know what you're looking at?
 Hasuzawa: 3k players in silver, that is half the players. is this normal? (first time contester in CG)
 struct: my code is unreadable
 KalamariKing: Almost 3k in bronze too
 struct: Even I cant read it
 UndercoverToad: but you are not a top player with interesting code :boom:
 struct: Toad that is it
 struct: Im gonna take your spot
 Chainman: :grimacing:
 RoboStac: he might be, we're still waiting for him to submit his better version
 UndercoverToad: robo you don't handle the end of game yet, do you?
 RoboStac: in what way?
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553059229">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553059229</a> last day
 UndercoverToad: you upgrade a tree for 7 suns
 KalamariKing: in java, ints are 4 bytes, rightWhich means 8 bytes --&gt; float
 RoboStac: it's calculated a guarenteed win, doesn't matter if it's not the optimal score
 mybk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp</a>
 UndercoverToad: ah, you check the actual winning
 RoboStac: yeah
 UndercoverToad: i'm still in single player optim mode
 RoboStac: I win a disturbing amount on drawed score + more trees
 RoboStac: but a win is a win
 KalamariKing: thanks mybk
 ddreams: just for fun, how many points do you top guys score against the default AI on a board without holes?
 UndercoverToad: and i'm stilling trees too early in that game&#160;:(
 ddreams: or, this seed: seed=-5057826633060784100
 ddreams: for the first time I reached over 200
 RoboStac: as I thought my end game solving was actually pretty secure
 mybk: KalamariKing np,&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: 196-0 vs default
 KalamariKing: have you ever scraped together code and somehow it works but you don't know how
 struct: 220 vs default
 UndercoverToad: but i sell trees early to get points before the opponent - which isn't a good strategy vs that bot
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553080392">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553080392</a>but could actually help me debug
 Chainman: I hope I know what I'm doing right now :cold_sweat:, been writing first beam search and simulation.
 ddreams: yeah, like I got 202 vs the bot and 95 vs you
 UndercoverToad: i'm always selling too much mid-game
 struct: you can thank me for default for being random deterministic 
 ddreams: this is with 0 search though
 ddreams: thanks structyboy
 UndercoverToad: was it random nondeterministic?
 UndercoverToad: these are the worst
 struct: yes
 Chainman: you forced him to get 0 points 
 struct: I complained on day 1
 RoboStac: I only score 90-19 vs default&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: but you win
 RoboStac: so sure it's going to win on day 18 it stops doing anything 
 Queuebee: lool
 UndercoverToad: a good horse only jumps as high as it has to
 UndercoverToad: my bot is a blind horse
 codingWhale: a good blind horse
 UndercoverToad: somewhere around midgame i screw up by selling everything
 RoboStac: your the bot I've been optimising against because I struggled so much being behind from that point
 UndercoverToad: looking at my last battles you did a good job with that
 solistice: I'm lost... created a GetHashCode function and deepcloning my object return a different hashcode
 RoboStac: yeah, but now I'm still at the same rank and just losing somewhere else 
 solistice: now to try and figure out what is wrong :D
 UndercoverToad: then you should revert to the old bot
 KalamariKing: does the hashcode take into account memory locations
 KalamariKing: or smth like that
 solistice: it shouldnt
 7amasa: When does gold open?
 struct: how would that work?
 ddreams: well, they open the league and let players in
 KalamariKing: idk just guessing, if the deepcopy is working successfully then that's all that would change, I would think
 UndercoverToad: gold in 5h
 7amasa: Thanks!!
 struct: top 500?
 UndercoverToad: i hope not
 struct: just make me boss idc
 ddreams: top 612 preferably
 UndercoverToad: you have a search, you take too much time
 UndercoverToad: i bet it will be a heuristic bot. probably python
 itzluku: i need to chaneg my model for the sim&#160;:(
 itzluku: change*
 struct: I think im going to work on the sync issue now
 struct: After that I will only work on eval
 KalamariKing: should I use an array of bools (1 bit each) or a bitboard
 KalamariKing: does an array have overhead?
 struct: bitboard
 RoboStac: the main point of bitboarding is to let you do operations on multiple things at once - having an array of bools would break that
 struct: 64 boolean is 64 bytes
 KalamariKing: but a boolean is 1 bit, not 1 byte
 RoboStac: eg I can count trees by seeing how many bits are set in one uint64 (which is a very cheap operation) - having to iterate an array wouldn't do that
 struct: bool arr[64];cerr &lt;&lt; sizeof(arr) &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: 64
 RoboStac: bools are almost always represented by bytes because bits aren't easy to use
 blasterpoard: KalamariKing you can only address a byte, so if you create an array where every item can be individually adressed, then each one has to take an entire byte
 struct: I can calculate shadows with shifts
 RoboStac: there are some exceptions (c++ std::vector&lt;bool&gt;) but I still don't think there is a quick way to get the number of set bits
 blasterpoard: imho vector&lt;bool&gt; is just a mess that should have a different name
 RoboStac: yes
 RoboStac: I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it was a mistake by now
 struct: never used it, is it that bad?
 ddreams: probably 15 years ago too
 Queuebee: since the code size is...? 100kb?  do you hardcode masks/lookup tables or generate them at the start?
 Queuebee: max code size*
 struct: I have them hardcoded
 RoboStac: it's just awkward as standard c++ things don't work properly with it (as you can't take the address of an element) and it's mostly slower than having a vector of bytes 
 struct: ah I see
 RoboStac: plus it catches you by surprise because no other type changes size when stored in vector
 blasterpoard: the first time I learned about it was when I was wondering wth is valgrind trying to tell me
 blasterpoard: there is no indication that vector&lt;bool&gt; behaves differently than other vectors
 ddreams: after two days, it appears I have managed to improve my bot
 ddreams: let's see if the battles confirm it
 DaNinja: 900k sims per turn doesnt help much when this eval sucks
 VizGhar: My eval most probably sucks because my bot sees 40moves ahead, but ignoring opponent movements :D
 ddreams: that's not why it sucks
 VizGhar: I'll try to give my opponent head
 ddreams: umm..
 ddreams: nice, jumped 300 ranks
 VizGhar: hey you are 5 ranks behind... let me be
 ddreams: cya later alligator
 Chainman: after 2 days my bot is worse&#160;:( lol
 KalamariKing: For bitboarding, should I:
 Nerchio: imo you dont need so much optimization 
 Nerchio: just try to avoid too much mess
 Nerchio: i have 1 bitboard per tree size
 Nerchio: works fine
 KalamariKing: Ok thanks
 KalamariKing: I'm new to all this so I'll be needing some guidance from all you masters
 Astrobytes: VizGhar 12:35PM"I'll try to give my opponent head"
 elijah.toppo: My heuristics algorithm was doing much better than beam search, it seems.. Or I've done it wrong. :disappointed:
 UndercoverToad: i try to get my opponent's head. decapitating sounds like an option
 VizGhar: Astrobytes ouch... yeah. sounds quite... not right
 Astrobytes: :D
 VizGhar: toad probably didnt understand the reference i believe
 KalamariKing: Nerchio then to get a cell's stage, I have to go through each bitboard, right?
 Astrobytes: Just as well really VizGhar&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: giving a headstart I suppose
 UndercoverToad: or tossing a coin?
 VizGhar: giving head = blowjob
 Nerchio: KalamariKing you mean treeSize on a cell? yeah you need to check each bitboard
 UndercoverToad: kick!
 KalamariKing: UndercoverToad that was the joke tho, he unintentionally said it
 KalamariKing: Nerchio thanks
 KalamariKing: how come java freaks out with while(false) but not if(false)
 Chainman: What does the 61.95 mean, I notice it hasn't changed much at all. 
 KalamariKing: Nerchio sorry for the hundreds of pings, but how would you select cell n? right-bitshift the bitboard n places and bitwise-and with 0x00...01?
 KalamariKing: Chainman where
 JSboss: kalamariking - while(false) is unreachable, whereas if (false) is just dead. Java won't compile when unreachability is detected.
 UndercoverToad: yes, sorry for pinging you Nerchio
 Astrobytes: Nerchio must be upset with all these pings
 Chainman: How does the score work I mean?  
 Chainman: in the leaderboard
 KalamariKing: we should really stop pinging Nerchio its probably annoying
 UndercoverToad: somehow this chat account is gaining some followers despite not doing anything besides chat
 Nerchio: i don't get any pings sorry to disappoint lol
 KalamariKing: Chainman I have no clue, but does cg have a faq with it? idk
 UndercoverToad: how is that possible Nerchio?
 UndercoverToad: external client?
 Chainman: lol, I followed because it is for chatting.
 VizGhar: Nerchio tell us
 Nerchio: idk guys ask codingame stuff :D
 UndercoverToad: staff?
 RoboStac: chainman -  it's trueskill based (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a>)
 Nerchio: i must have disabled alerts long ago
 Chainman: It says in your profile it is chat account for eulerscheZahl lol
 Chainman: Not really undercover at all
 UndercoverToad: i just wanted to use that profile pic
 virus_coder99: hello word
 Nerchio: KalamariKing 1L &lt;&lt; position;
 Mourfette: Is it possible to learn this power?
 struct: I get pings 10% of the time
 struct: Its strange
 UndercoverToad: and lots of false positives
 KalamariKing: str​uct is this a ping
 Chainman: O for sure RoboStac, wasn't sure if it had more meaning
 UndercoverToad: when it comes to classes and structs
 struct: didnt ping
 struct: is not even red
 KalamariKing: lmao there's a 200b in the middle that's why
 KalamariKing: unicode 200b
 KalamariKing: zero width space
 Chainman: whenever I use a struct in my code.
 KalamariKing: just making sure it works&#160;;)
 struct: red but no ping
 Nerchio: servers are busy with my submits
 UndercoverToad: i'm at 67 already, was spamming a bit in frustration
 KalamariKing: 67 submits? Or 67th in the contest?
 UndercoverToad: 67 submits
 Nerchio: i change magic variables but i think if i dont add anything bigger then no progress
 KalamariKing: Oh wow
 UndercoverToad: let's make it 68
 KalamariKing: I have like 3
 Nerchio: im on 77 submits
 Chainman: I'm at 5 hahah,
 actualCoderTrevor: Where do you get the number of submits?
 Chainman: Really just don't have anything good to submit.
 RoboStac: history button on the left
 Nerchio: history left side of the screen
 Nerchio: :rage:
 actualCoderTrevor: Thanks
 Cjx_1: 77 :0
 actualCoderTrevor: I have 49 - thought it would be more
 Nerchio: well like 30 of those are today
 Chainman: I went all out writing my first simulation and beam search algo and it's taking me days.  
 Chainman: And maybe all today improving it. 
 UndercoverToad: you will get better over time
 KalamariKing: guys I'm doing it, the bitboard is working somewhat
 struct: already?
 KalamariKing: well
 KalamariKing: I got one function working
 Chainman: haha nice 
 KalamariKing: Which counts for something at least to me since this is my first time using bitboards
 Numby: Using bitboards do you still calculate shadows with a loop or possible to do with just bit operations?
 struct: no loops
 UndercoverToad: huh?
 struct: only shifts
 UndercoverToad: i still have a loop for the length of the shadow
 ZarthaxX: you can remove that toad
 UndercoverToad: loop unrolling?
 ZarthaxX: nah
 ZarthaxX: oh god my voice is broken after class
 UndercoverToad: then i'm confused
 ZarthaxX: just finished with kids :P
 UndercoverToad: i can't hear you, we are not on discord
 Numby: Yeah I cant figure out a way to get shadows with just shifts
 ZarthaxX: i know :P
 struct: euler my board as 3 bit pad minimum
 struct: I dont need loops
 Nerchio: you mean 3 bit holes?
 struct: yes
 Nerchio: makes sense i followed a guide from research paper did like they told me :D
 jfaixo: protip :o
 struct: I used paint
 Nerchio: was 3/2/1/1/2/3 empty spaces
 aCat: yeah 3 bits offset is better
 Nerchio: so i need to clear after each shift
 KalamariKing: Quick interjection here when it says "n language assist interrupted" how do you get it back? I've just waited until it comes back somehow but is there a way to force it?
 aCat: but I encoded same as Nerchio anyways&#160;;]
 Numby: So instead of adjacent bits representing adjacent board indices, you have some padding/weird logic such that a shift produces the shadows? Is that even possible O.o
 aCat: yep
 KalamariKing: Numby yes actually, its a bit too mind-warping for me tho
 Numby: But there's 6 directions and only 2 shifts hm
 RoboStac: you shift by different amounts each day
 Nerchio: the secret is in the numbers
 Numby: I gotta sit down and do that math. I didn't even think this would be possible
 RoboStac: so each neighbour hex is always a constant offset for that direction 
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf</a>
 RoboStac: eg on a square 8x8 grid you'd shift 1 for left/right and 8 for up /down
 Nerchio: its not a virus :grinning:
 DetoBot: well I am using bit boards
 Numby: in order accommodate the padding, how large of a variable you're using to store the 37 cells?
 Nerchio: for ppl who want to use bitboards theres something about hexes and shifts
 DetoBot: it generating moves efficiently
 KalamariKing: thanks Nerchio
 KalamariKing: wait I already read that
 DetoBot: my only problem is eval fnc and search tree
 KalamariKing: letsgoo
 Nerchio: reading it once is not enough probably :D
 RoboStac: you probably don't actually need any of this (I'm still using official indexes + loops), but it's an interesting optimisation
 KalamariKing: oh yeah lol, I've printed it and pored over the pages
 Nerchio: especially if you are a slow mind like me
 Numby: Ah that paper just has hex boards too and pictures. Seems to be a great resource, thanks!
 DetoBot: oh no
 KalamariKing: oh YES
 DetoBot: i did a few steps more that the article provided
 DetoBot: still no problem
 DetoBot: nice article
 Reiten: If I have a size 3 tree in the center(index ), does it mean I can plant a seed anywhere on the field?
 struct: yes.
 KalamariKing: oh sick
 Reiten: I see then BFS it is. Thanks
 KalamariKing: Are java classes efficient
 Nerchio: depends whats the job
 KalamariKing: a container for grouping a few vars
 Nerchio: why not
 Nerchio: what else you want to use in java :D
 KalamariKing: ok thanks :D
 struct: use structs its faster
 KalamariKing: explain the difference
 Nerchio: java has no structs
 KalamariKing: yeah I thought that was cpp
 ddreams: and many other languages
 KalamariKing: oh really?
 KalamariKing: interesting
 KalamariKing: So it's not too costly to use classes as a container for a few variables?
 struct: its what they are made for
 KalamariKing: Or should I maintain a 2d array
 Nerchio: no just dont create thousands of them all the time and you should be fine
 TobiasA: the highest my bot as gotten is 95 points and it can never go higher than that it seems. it is miserable
 TobiasA: i have run out of ideas
 ddreams: when you watch your bot, does it do what you want?
 ddreams: if not, you have an idea
 TobiasA: hm?
 Tuo: a good bot seems to do random stuff and still wins&#160;:)
 ddreams: doesn't seem like that in this game, in my opinion
 aangairbender: hey guys
 ZarthaxX: oh the god is here
 ZarthaxX: hello
 aangairbender: my bot went from 30 to 40 :sweat_smile:
 aangairbender: time to work on eval
 struct: my bot went from 1st to 383
 ddreams: what, am I beating you now?
 aangairbender: struct submit new one, I know you have it
 struct: I have but is not that better
 ddreams: when I finally got this bot better, it beat my old one 96% of the time
 ddreams: thought something was wrong at first
 aangairbender: I played 3 games with an old one, it did 2/1 so I submitted
 aangairbender: well, I knew it has to be stronger with new approach
 ddreams: I thought so too, two days ago after implementing bitboards
 aangairbender: but submit is pretty fast here
 KalamariKing: Is it worth rebuilding the bitboards per turn for simplicity
 ddreams: why not?
 KalamariKing: idk, speed
 KalamariKing: gives more time for eval
 aangairbender: rebuild from what?
 KalamariKing: the input loop
 aangairbender: ah, I though about simulation
 aangairbender: I store no data from previous turn
 KalamariKing: Also how can you make the language assist recover, it always keeps dropping
 ddreams: how much time do you think it takes?
 aangairbender: I store only initial richness/neighs
 KalamariKing: d​dreams well idk, I've never worked with bitboards before
 aangairbender: bitboards might be slower than simple arrays
 aangairbender: but they allow low memory usage
 ddreams: I don't think you need bitboards here, but if you want to learn and it's your first time, do everything for simplicity
 ZarthaxX: they are cache friendly
 ZarthaxX: :D
 aangairbender: I have trees encoded in bitmasks
 KalamariKing: I have to take the fastest approach because it keeps timing out, so wouldn't bitboards be fastest
 aangairbender: KalamariKing what is your state size?
 KalamariKing: I'm using bitboards/bitmasks interchangeably here
 KalamariKing: aangairbender right now, about 60 bytes
 ddreams: profile your bot?
 aangairbender: so its less than 64, no need to optimize memory anymore
 aangairbender: actually its better to profile your bot and see critical spots
 ddreams: bitboards isn't mainly for saving space, but for doing operations in parallel
 KalamariKing: That's what I want to do
 KalamariKing: Using arrays it's massive, so I switched to bitboards and only now is it about 60 bytes
 Cjx_1: any python guys at silver on?
 ddreams: depends on what it takes to be a "python guy"
 aangairbender: top17 uses Python 
 Noyotens: the gold league is open&#160;??? 
 KalamariKing: is it?
 aangairbender: not yet
 Noyotens: idk
 ddreams: nay
 KalamariKing: I thought not
 Noyotens: ok thx
 Chainman: when gold opens I will move up in silver&#160;:) lol
 KalamariKing: is there a way to go back a leauge?
 KalamariKing: league*
 Noyotens: NO
 KalamariKing: That was punctual
 Chainman: What if you submit a worse bot
 KalamariKing: Thought not
 ddreams: No, you can't drop leagues
 KalamariKing: If you submit a trash bot can you go down leagues then
 ddreams: no
 KalamariKing: Or is it like once you're here, you're her
 KalamariKing: e*
 peerdb: yep
 KalamariKing: hmm ok
 KalamariKing: There's no primitive of 16-byte length so is there a way to a.) create your own or b.) declare, say, 'type long with length 16 bytes'
 ddreams: "short"
 KalamariKing: Short is 2 bytes
 ddreams: oh, 16 BYTES
 KalamariKing: yes BYTES
 ddreams: in Java, no
 derjack: language?
 KalamariKing: java
 derjack: BigInteger?
 KalamariKing: I know there are differently sized integers and stuff but do any primitives reach 16 bytes
 derjack: nope
 KalamariKing: hmm
 KalamariKing: alr thanks
 ddreams: why do you want that anyway?
 KalamariKing: Two bits representing each cell all in one bitboard
 KalamariKing: About 9 bytes
 KalamariKing: I think the largest (long and/or double) only reach 8 bytes
 Noyotens: i am 1126 rd
 UndercoverToad: th
 peerdb: sth
 ddreams: sounds complicated anyway
 KalamariKing: wdym
 ddreams: 2 bits to represent tree size?
 KalamariKing: instead of the bit at n, its the two bits at n*2
 KalamariKing: the size is the integer representation of those two bits, e.x. stage 0 is 00, stage 3 is 11
 KalamariKing: so bit-shift `stages` n*2 bits, and then get the integer rep of (stages &amp; 3L)
 Dahll: Someone managed to make AlphaBeta work?
 ddreams: here I'm ignoring the opponent's moves
 Dahll: xD I mean to this chellenge
 KalamariKing: Seems faster than checking 4 different bitboards right?
 ddreams: I don't think so
 Dahll: Thks&#160;!
 KalamariKing: why tho?
 KalamariKing: I'm new to all this so I'll need explanations behind your reasonign
 reCurse: You just complicated your shifting for no good reason
 KalamariKing: why is that more complicated tho?
 ddreams: I don't know for sure, but I guess the conversion to and from the size will be a big part of your cpu time
 reCurse: Your board no longer holds in 64 bits
 ddreams: often I am looking at only a certain type of tree
 reCurse: Checking 4 different boards comes for free since they're contiguous in memory
 reCurse: And also what ddreams said
 KalamariKing: Okay thanks
 KalamariKing: Can a constructor call another overloaded constructor of the same class
 aangairbender: after submitting lost 3 games due to timeout (which never happened before) and because of that I climb veeeery slow now. No more timeouts btw
 reCurse: This is the kind of question you can google
 KalamariKing: yes but google requires a new tab and I can keep typing while you all are answering
 KalamariKing: But fine
 FrancoisB: -_-'
 reCurse: So take other people's time to compensate for your laziness?

 KalamariKing: why are you like this anti
 miszu: good morning children
 ddreams: good morning child
 miszu: KalamariKing which language you are talking about?
 KalamariKing: miszu java
 KalamariKing: I learned no, so I created a new func to act as an initializer and called the initializer per each constructor
 miszu: from my best understanding, you cannot call from one constructor to another because... how would you?
 KalamariKing: exactly
 miszu: and if you feel that you want to call another constructor then it is an indication of a bad smell in your code&#160;;) 
 reCurse: Um... no?
 ddreams: ^
 KalamariKing: yeah ik, I'm transitioning between a few things rn and just making sure the new stuff works
 miszu: yeah
 ddreams: of another overloaded class, reCurse
 ddreams: in the same hierarchy
 KalamariKing: pretty much everything is overloaded, eventually it will get whittled down tho
 reCurse: He said same class
 KalamariKing: Same class different constructor
 KalamariKing: Not possible afaia
 ddreams: oh, ok, misunderstood then
 Radewoosh: Guys, I'm getting strange runtime error sometimes and I want to test my code locally, is there any tutorial on how to run the tester from repository?

 KalamariKing: wdym
 UndercoverToad: not that brutaltester link, doesn't really answer the question
 KalamariKing: Rabeeb pings? just type someone's name and it will appear red for them
 peerdb: how many people do you think will be put in gold when it opens?
 Rabeeb: @KalamariKing is it red to you?
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 Rabeeb: I see, smart!
 KalamariKing: Rabeeb you don't need the @ sign btw, also you can tab complete (e.x. 'rab[tab]' --&gt; 'Rabeeb')

 peerdb: Wontonimo I am excited yeah, curious to see if my rank 187 will enter gold
 KalamariKing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc0ee3b6-d01c-4e85-8be6-21c86403b21f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fc0ee3b6-d01c-4e85-8be6-21c86403b21f</a>
 UndercoverToad: i did and it got worse aangairbender. so the bug is back in place now
 KalamariKing: oh come on that was only 4 lines
 Wontonimo: i'll take all the accomplishments i can get, no matter how small others say they are! 
 UndercoverToad: not generating all possible SEED actions
 Wontonimo: peerdb I'm close to you so possible I'll follow you
 Rabeeb: @peerdb shouldn't it?
 Rabeeb: 187 should be good to go
 miszu: KalamariKing you could open the java bytecode and see what it does
 miszu: there is no guarantee what the compiler does between side effects
 Rabeeb: btw, how many of u are actually using beam search?
 ddreams: it'll almost certainly be optimized
 miszu: ddreams yeah for sure
 ddreams: and the bytecode doesn't tell the entire story
 ddreams: JIT says hi
 miszu: ddreams well... it should
 UndercoverToad: KalamariKing you can try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org/</a>
 miszu: jvm runs the bytecote
 KalamariKing: thanks noteuler
 Radewoosh: UndercoverToad: I'm getting an error trying to run it, but looks close, thanks
 ddreams: it's compiled to native code first
 Wontonimo: what's the querystring thing that you add to turn off chat?  somethinng like ?disablechat 
 UndercoverToad: KalamariKing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/irW8MN5">https://imgur.com/a/irW8MN5</a>
 UndercoverToad: 2 functions
 UndercoverToad: you can fiddle with compiler options
 KalamariKing: Wontonimo at the end of the url type ?disableChat
 UndercoverToad: Radewoosh and error message worth sharing? So far I only ran it from IntelliJ directly
 UndercoverToad: any*
 ddreams: I have probably encountered your error message too.. I bumped into a lot
 Radewoosh: no main manifest attribute, in ./target/spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
 KalamariKing: Yeah so it stays as separate funcsI thought I read somewhere java was aggressively compressed, coulda been c++ or smth though
 KalamariKing: Thanks
 Radewoosh: In ocen of code repository there was a file main.java
 Radewoosh: While there is no such one
 Radewoosh: There is TestMain.java
 Wontonimo: KalamariKing can't believe i guessed correctly but didn't try it.  Thanks for confirming :D
 ddreams: I think it may be better to use the Zenocave referee?
 Radewoosh: I'm not much into java, so I don't know if it's possible to force some other function to be the starting one or so
 ddreams: that has a main
 TobiasA: if i were to store a variable in a file before the game starts would i be able to get that variable from that file in the middle of the game or in the while loop or the site doesn't allow that
 UndercoverToad: TestMain and Main from the other repo are equivalanet, maybe just renaming helps
 AntiSquid: #9 TS
 UndercoverToad: Java isn't my main language either
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard</a>
 Wontonimo: good luck everyone!  I hope the Gods of Gold do you justice 
 Wontonimo: cy
 AntiSquid: bye
 ddreams: TobiasA: I'm pretty sure you can't read or write files
 ddreams: haven't tried though
 aangairbender: I found an interesting bug. When search was terminated due to timeout sometimes I didnt return the move to make
 Radewoosh: Well, there are three files in the test directory, each of them has main function, but none of them seems to care about command line arguments
 ddreams: Radewoosh: use this fork <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 ddreams: it has a command line parser main
 miszu: aangairbender that's why you update the best move after each iteration
 itzluku: gold in 2h right?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 itzluku: ty
 aangairbender: euler do you update the best move on each iteration?
 aangairbender: I had code like 'take first node from the leaves'
 aangairbender: but sometimes leaves didnt have enough time to appear
 ddreams: you may check if it matters to reduce the timeout too.. like I never reached another depth given 10ms more anyway
 ddreams: but I do store the best action every iteration though
 UndercoverToad: i take a leaf node but don't exit early
 UndercoverToad: i rather timeout and crash completely than not finishing the current layer :D
 UndercoverToad: not my proudest code
 AntiSquid: commitment
 aangairbender: what's interesting I crashed only vs low ranks
 aangairbender: maybe they dont seed and I have more actions idk
 ddreams: I regularly fiddle with the depth/width, so having fixed depth would be a hassle
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad oh thought about that
 UndercoverToad: i have a dynamic depth but stop at 40ms already
 UndercoverToad: or over 10k nodes visited
 ZarthaxX: only 40 ms damn
 UndercoverToad: there are turns where I only take about 5ms
 AntiSquid: wonder how you prune
 ddreams: why though? wouldn't it sometimes be better to search deeper if the situation is simpler?
 UndercoverToad: or even 0ms (when there is only WAIT) :P
 aangairbender: why you limit your search? because opponent isnt afk in game?
 UndercoverToad: hm, the beam width increase changes these timings a bit
 UndercoverToad: when all paths of the beam have the same first step, there is no point
 UndercoverToad: and with increasing uncertainty in later days it's also pointless
 ashelkov: you are able to reach top10 without building a sim, just on heuristics
 ashelkov: as i do )
 kovi: well done
 UndercoverToad: that sounds painful yet impressive
 kovi: i gave up few days ago
 ashelkov: sad (
 AntiSquid: gave up on what?
 UndercoverToad: heuristics
 ddreams: I'll have a look at some of your games now
 ZarthaxX: or the contest?
 ZarthaxX: D:
 AntiSquid: nice rank ashelkov
 ashelkov: thx, man
 ZarthaxX: gz ashelkov
 ZarthaxX: impressive!
 ZarthaxX: in your profile
 AntiSquid: one piece i guess
 Gronahak: reminds me of one piece
 AntiSquid: made in blender? :p
 AntiSquid: Sanji (chef) from one piece 
 cegprakash: where is MadKnight
 cegprakash: he was active before the contest
 cegprakash: and disappeared during contest
 Wontonimo: oh oh ... last minute submits have pushed me down!
 VizGhar: wym last minute?&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: gold will be open soon
 VizGhar: My bot will be chosen as boss :D
 VizGhar: rank 299... sounds about right
 ddreams: then retaliate with your own last minute submit, Wontonimo
 BrunoFelthes: what time gold will be open?
 UndercoverToad: in 1.5h
 ZarthaxX: bet for gold #&#160;? :P
 VizGhar: far from last minute
 BrunoFelthes: how many players are you think?
 UndercoverToad: 300. but i was completely off for silver too so i'm not trustworthy
 dbdr: 100
 VizGhar: 186
 UndercoverToad: more
 BrunoFelthes: what? only 100?
 RoboStac: I'd expect it to be higher given how big silver is
 RoboStac: probably 6-800?
 Thienu: how is the number chosen?
 UndercoverToad: 300 is on the low end
 dbdr: by that logic we would have a huge legend too&#160;:/
 VizGhar: my guess is 500
 BrunoFelthes: i think 300, once 300 can be reach with heuristics...
 UndercoverToad: the league size is in the decision of SaiksyApo
 jfaixo: 1000
 UndercoverToad: that would be a bit too much
 UndercoverToad: gold won't be a 50% cut like silver
 TheBatMan_TM: hey guys
 TheBatMan_TM: i need help
 VizGhar: 400-500 seems like a good guess
 UndercoverToad: and legend is jaw-dropping small
 AntiSquid: 25% 
 BrunoFelthes: in genral is 50% 25% and 10%,no&#160;?
 AntiSquid: still going with that
 AntiSquid: and legend 10 - 20 :D
 AntiSquid: no&#160;% for legend bruno, just 10
 TheBatMan_TM: can anyone spot the error in this flask web app? It says a template 'home.html' is not found, even if i have declared the file
 TheBatMan_TM: source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://replit.com/@kaushikkalesh/Online-Notes">https://replit.com/@kaushikkalesh/Online-Notes</a>
 AntiSquid: it's always steep like that
 ZarthaxX: TheBatMan_TM there is a contest going on, doubt you will get help :P
 TheBatMan_TM: please someone fix it if u can
 AntiSquid: web app geez, wrong site for that
 VizGhar: sure... go get a coffee&#160;:)
 TheBatMan_TM: ZarthaxX oh :disappointed: 
 AntiSquid: and flask  too ..
 ZarthaxX: also people here may not be experienced with web apps haha
 TheBatMan_TM: but i have had help earlier AntiSquad
 ZarthaxX: lol squad
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 TheBatMan_TM: I am more of a django guy, but i am experimenting with flask
 Astrobytes: SquadthaxX
 ZarthaxX: astro!
 TheBatMan_TM: oops mispelled AntiSquid sorry
 ZarthaxX: howdy cutie
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :kissing_heart:
 AntiSquid: just type A and press tab and hit enter immediately, it writes the name for you TheBatMan_TM
 ddreams: TheBatMan_TM find a flask discord or something
 aangairbender: TheBatMan_TM file views.py line 7, shouldnt it be 'templates/home.html'
 aangairbender:&#160;?
 TheBatMan_TM: k AntiSquid i didn't know
 TheBatMan_TM: aangairbender no tried that still doesn't work
 TheBatMan_TM: doesn't make a difference i think
 AntiSquid: wrong place as ai said
 ddreams: too late, this is now a Flask helpline
 RoboStac: how do I implement a beam search in flask?
 ddreams: First, get a glass bottle. Then get a laser
 Nagatwin: distribute it over the network
 TheBatMan_TM: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 lazy_boy: hello guys
 UndercoverToad: that would be distributed codejam Nagatwin
 UndercoverToad: it's dead&#160;:(
 TheBatMan_TM: hey newboi
 Nagatwin: That would be awesome tho
 lazy_boy: hi i'm new here
 Nagatwin: I'm struggling with my beam search&#160;:(
 lazy_boy: how long you guys have been here?
 ddreams: since the beginning of time itself
 lazy_boy: :sweat_smile:
 TheBatMan_TM: i haven't seen the chat silent so long
 TheBatMan_TM: power of flask 
 TomKeersmaekers: Hey there all. Wood 1 league (sry) question: are there any extra inputs as compared to wood 2?
 kurtesy: #coc
 RoboStac: the input format is the same in alll leagues, but some of the unused parts from wood 2 will be needed (eg tree size)
 Mourfette: no new inputs, just more possible moves
 TomKeersmaekers: Damn, then what would be your first thought when this warning pops up:
 TomKeersmaekers: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 RoboStac: you've probably printed two moves on one turn
 ddreams: you output before you read, or you output several lines
 ddreams: *before you read everything
 TomKeersmaekers: outputting several lines .. will look into that
 solistice: anyone here tried MCTS?
 TomKeersmaekers: That fixed it! Thx. I basically was using a foreach loop and assumed a Console.WriteLine would break out of it. An extra empty return statement fixed it.
 KalamariKing: I haven't implemented it BUT after enough research I decided to go with beam search solistice
 solistice: not sure what I'm doing wrong, but in C#, I can only reach about 5 simulations
 solistice: in 100ms
 solistice: that doesn't seem legit, rigiht?
 reCurse: Not sure either
 KalamariKing: Not at all
 LLG: not at all
 LLG: my bot's performance is ass but it still does about 10k sims
 ddreams: Legit too slow
 solistice: ugggh
 KalamariKing: Is there smth with move gen or states? Maybe game state is too much mem moving
 actualCoderTrevor: What are you considering a "simulation"? One move? One Turn? One Day? All 23 days?
 solistice: all 23 days
 solistice: random playout
 ddreams: probably too slow move generation, but profile it
 aangairbender: that is kinda slow, I had 300k
 actualCoderTrevor: Hmm yeah that seems slow for random playout
 solistice: never done profiling on c#
 solistice: will try to look into it
 KalamariKing: What IS profiling
 ddreams: Are you an American police officer?
 KalamariKing: lmao no
 aangairbender: profiling is when you run your program and then see how many time each function took
 KalamariKing: oh ok thats pretty eary
 KalamariKing: easy*
 solistice: any out of the box solutions to do profiling on/for codingame?
 aangairbender: visual studio has very good profiling feature
 ddreams: you can do your own profiling by timing in the code too, if you want an in the box solution too
 KalamariKing: 'in the box' lol
 UndercoverToad: but that's not a big help in finding bottle necks
 UndercoverToad: just to get an overall feeling "10k nodes in 40ms"
 ddreams: depends on how granular you put your profiling calls
 aangairbender: euler you said you stop if your total amount of nodes is more than 10k, but isnt amount of nodes always small due to beam cutting
 UndercoverToad: nodes visited. seed makes that number explode
 actualCoderTrevor: As a quick-and-dirty method you can comment parts of code out until things speed up a lot
 UndercoverToad: 50 nodes can easily get 5k before you prune again
 aangairbender: I see, you count cut ones as well
 jrke: i think they are gonna take nearly 500-600 in gold
 ZarthaxX: just by your rank jrke 
 reCurse: My bet is on 200
 UndercoverToad: that would be nice for the 5%
 jrke: i bet 450-500
 UndercoverToad: we want to give everyone a chance to reach gold
 jrke: bye cya in sometime
 UndercoverToad: legend is another story luckily
 reCurse: Gotta take into account desired end target
 reCurse: Since it inflates a lot after
 reCurse: Start at 200 and get 300 after 12 hours
 UndercoverToad: i'm off for a walk, will be back around opening time
 mainman: anyone else getting this?  Activating Python 3 Language Assist
 Wontonimo: have a great walk UndercoverToad
 Maciulis: take away the top 100 big boys and let plebs fight it out 
 ddreams: mainman, no I'm getting C++ Language Assist interrupted
 KalamariKing: mainman yeah language assist isn't working for me rn
 Thienu: i implement beam search with my heuristics and somehow its worse&#160;:(
 Luxiam: Same here. No assist right now
 ddreams: same happened to me, Thienu
 AntiSquid: Activating C++ Language Assist
 KalamariKing: Yeah ok language assist must be down rn, mods you got info?
 reCurse: Mods are just regular users with a badge
 reCurse: Gotta ask staff
 KalamariKing: Oh lol
 AntiSquid: frontline cannon fodder
 KalamariKing: Are there staff in chat
 reCurse: Also known as janitors
 ddreams: They are wise enough to keep quiet
 mainman: cool just checking&#160;:)
 reCurse: Sometimes, they have [CG] tag
 AntiSquid: do i get a CG janitor outfit? :thinking:
 RoboStac: you are already wearing it
 Wontonimo: lol
 AntiSquid: didn't you have a pokeball robo?
 RoboStac: yeah, but it went away with one of the server restarts
 ddreams: heuristics is soo sensitive
 AntiSquid: use gradient descent to adjust your heuristics :P
 Smelty: lol
 reCurse: Yeah they're prone to be offended
 VizGhar: For how many of you guys single node represents whole game day?
 Smelty: me who doesnt use nodes: *confused ooga booga*
 VizGhar: I did the turn=node, and its sh**y
 Smelty: f
 AntiSquid: why? depends how you implemented it
 VizGhar: yeah... maybe I'm dumb
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgflip.com/i/599n3b">https://imgflip.com/i/599n3b</a>
 ddreams: :D
 ClockSort: Vizghar I strongly one-node=one-day that but decided against it... it still seems like a decent idea though
 Smelty: hrrrrrm
 reCurse: CG seems to stay being popular in Japan, it's nice to see
 Smelty: yes
 AntiSquid: maybe the totoro theme helped
 reCurse: Sure but it stayed that way since SC20
 Smelty: possibly
 Wontonimo: i like the Totoro theme... nice to see a game where the objective isn't to killing
 Smelty: yea
 AntiSquid: pacman and zelda both have same country of origin 
 reCurse: Good point, though arguable if it has the same pull shrug
 AntiSquid: ya maybe it's a stretch to think that .
 reCurse: They called the witches grandmas&#160;:) At least the translation did.
 Smelty: *types*
 witty2: does red player have sun advantage??
 Smelty: nope
 Smelty: it should be even
 AntiSquid: depends on position witty2
 Noyotens: guys i want challenge someone in spring chalenge 
 AntiSquid: i am sure it's not even
 Smelty: Noyotens fight me
 AntiSquid: press DELETE under opponent avatar in IDE Noyotens
 Smelty: yep and then pick someone else
 Wontonimo: if you use brutal tester without swapping players, you'll see if it is uneven
 Smelty: yes.
 Noyotens: ok \
 Noyotens: who want challenge me
 AntiSquid: i am sure starting cells make a diff
 Noyotens: ur rank&#160;??
 Smelty: 1226 sadly
 AntiSquid: brutal tester would have random starting cells each time no&#160;?
 actualCoderTrevor: Noyotens feel free&#160;:)
 Smelty: in silver
 actualCoderTrevor: I just submitted a new bot
 Cuzo: hello, im new. i saw a yt video about this site and there were multiple modes but im just getting fastest code and shortest
 solistice: this MCTS is killing meeeee
 Smelty: still got a couple bug
 AntiSquid: Noyotens you can add me if you are in silver
 Smelty: Cuzo there's another mode called reverse mode
 Noyotens: i am in silver
 Smelty: you just haven't been getting it i think
 solistice: first round (1000ms) I get about 150 sims, then next rounds it's 10 MAX
 Smelty: i mean Noyotens if you want, then follow me and you can fight me
 Cuzo: do i need to change a setting or is just random?
 AntiSquid: ok delete default AI and add me
 AntiSquid: just search my name at the top
 Smelty: just random :_
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 Cuzo: ok thanks
 Smelty: unless you are in private clash then you can choose
 solistice: I can't seem to get this profiler to work properly
 KalamariKing: which?
 Noyotens: yeah work
 solistice: I'm getting discouraged&#160;:(
 Smelty: what rank?
 AntiSquid: click reply and share then copy paste replay link here Noyotens :P
 Wontonimo: go solistice go!  You can do it!  make a small test to just run 10 simulations and time it, vs 10 sims in your MCTS 
 Noyotens: ok :rolling_eyes:
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553305006">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553305006</a>
 Noyotens: so close
 Smelty: i should seriously start leaving comments in code
 Smelty: idk what half my code doing
 Wontonimo: solistice, have you timed each of your different kinds of calculations individually?  Like shadow calculation, sun points, etc?
 solistice: I just copied the code written by the referee, translated it to c#
 solistice: the problem is that I don't really know what "normal" time is
 Noyotens: anti squid are u here
 AntiSquid: yes
 Noyotens: how u win
 AntiSquid: how my bot works?
 Noyotens: yes
 Wontonimo: hey Noyotens, AntiSqu1d harvested trees way earlier and sucked all the nutrient away
 poInT: :D
 AntiSquid: ask someone from top 10 to tell you how their bot works, you'll learn a lot more
 Smelty: lol
 AntiSquid: that dbd r guy for example
 Smelty: antisquid is still a great informent though
 AntiSquid: what do you mean Smelty&#160;?
 Wontonimo: Noyotens , by turn 96 you have 6 size 3 trees, that costs a lot and is not an efficient spend of sun points to sustain that many.
 Smelty: way higher rank than me lol
 Noyotens: what the lugange u working with
 Smelty: just lost a game cuz opponent had 1 more tree than me&#160;:(
 Noyotens: me too
 Wontonimo: remember, each grow action costs the base amount plus 1 extra for each tree of that type.  So on turn 94 when you build your 7th big tree, it costs an additional 6 sun because you have 6 big trees already
 Noyotens: thx
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: a wise man you should listen to
 actualCoderTrevor: Smelty I've been optimizing what my bot says. I gave it a Borg personality that it uses 75% of the time now.
 Wontonimo: 6 sun is enough to do a lot more
 Smelty: nice trevor
 actualCoderTrevor:&#160;:)
 Smelty: six sun kinda doubles your cost
 Noyotens: Wontonimo this well help me a lot thank you
 actualCoderTrevor: I've seen my rank dip into the 300's a few times thanks to the improved speech.
 Smelty: see, the only reason I'm at 1200 even is that my bot just ko's the opponent with rickrolls and monty python

 Smelty: hello!
 Ya_rik: I graduate with CS major this fall!
 Smelty: there is a contest going on right now, so most people you see will be talking about it&#160;:)
 Smelty: nice!
 Ya_rik: okay sorry
 Noyotens: my rank is 1001 lol
 Smelty: oo
 Smelty: i just submited so its still fighting
 Smelty: Ya_rik: its this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 AntiSquid: add rick and morty to go along wit it Smelty
 Smelty: ooh
 Smelty: i shall do that
 Smelty: phase 1: monty python phase 2: rick and morty phase 3: rick
 actualCoderTrevor: No need to apologize lol. In fact, you might as well take part. It's fun!
 Smelty: yep!
 Smelty: after all, these contests only occur twice a year
 Ya_rik: im such a newb at coding I only know basics
 actualCoderTrevor: Or you can do some clash of codes if you don't want to invest a lot of time
 Ya_rik: thats why i am here. Im graduating in the fall but i dont really know how to code, code lol
 Smelty: yea
 AntiSquid: what was the CS graduation for? don't they teach anything?
 Smelty: ya_rik its fine
 KalamariKing: A lot of programming classes these days are theoretical, not how to get stuff done. Kinda sad
 AntiSquid: you're not the first i hear something like this ...
 YUMNOTSOJUCIY: hi
 YUMNOTSOJUCIY: hi
 Poostang: hi
 Thienu: hey
 Ya_rik: yeah my school did everything in java until this semester. My A.I class made us code in python 
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 break the chain
 Automaton2000: for example "wait the end is near!"
 Poostang: when should you grow vs seed&#160;?
 VizGhar: hmm downloaded <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a> brutaltester... not sure what to put after -r
 AntiSquid: that's good though? you now more languages then Ya_rik
 KalamariKing: Poostang that's the strategy part of the challenge, figure it out&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: anti *know
 Claire.C: i cant code anything.&lt;.
 Poostang: for now I think I will just alternate growing and seeding until like day 15
 KalamariKing: Is it just me or did a lot of level 3s just join chat
 Poostang: until I think of a better strategy
 Poostang: is that what people are using the tester for? heuristics like weighting on neural networks to figure that out?
 7amasa: when is gold?
 AntiSquid: @bear you jumped ahead 
 Ya_rik: yeah im a level 3 lol. Ill be back later though! c ya guys! Thanks for the words
 KalamariKing: 7amasa soon, I think
 KalamariKing: Ya_rik good luck!
 Michael_Howard: 3 minutes plus however long it takes them to sort it out
 7amasa: Cool, thanks guys
 BrunoFelthes: countdown to the new boss
 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgflip.com/i/599sq8">https://imgflip.com/i/599sq8</a>
 KalamariKing: Poostang I think so, but manually tuning search algorithms (beam, mcts, etc) instead of letting nn's train
 KalamariKing: If that makes sense
 Poostang: I was gonna start with dykstras to the richests tile that's closest and seed that path first
 AntiSquid: djkstra every turn? multiple times?
 Poostang: yes why not
 AntiSquid: time consuming
 Poostang: just for each plant
 Poostang: only 36 tiles though so the Big O is not going to break the bank
 Thienu: you can just precompute distance between each pair of cells
 actualCoderTrevor: i hope I make it to gold, but if not my rank in silver shoul improve. Win-win&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: why do you need distance tho?
 BrunoFelthes: where is the silver boss?
 actualCoderTrevor: *What Thienu said is what I do
 Thienu: i guess you could use it to figure out the size needed for grow
 Smelty: added rick and morty, might gain me a hundred ranks&#160;:)
 actualCoderTrevor: Noice
 Wontonimo: oh man ... the days have just flown by.  only 4 days left an i haven't coded my sim yet
 Smelty: idk though
 Smelty: ikr
 KalamariKing: Wontonimo same lol
 Smelty: lets see, first 30 rounds: rick and mortyfrom 30 to 55: monty python55 to end; rickroll
 KalamariKing: I wasn't able to work on this over the weekend tho&#160;:/
 actualCoderTrevor: Why can I only find opponents some of the time? (I can't see Smelty's new bot)
 Wontonimo: yesterday i started, got the data structures down, got brutal tester up, compiles, etc... so, today, yes today is the day
 Rikerslash: you can only battle people in top1000 it seems
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh poop
 actualCoderTrevor: Smelty you should share a replay
 ItsNotABug: yeah, its a shame it doesn't at least include people you follow as well
 AntiSquid: top 1000 only
 Thienu: i should also do the rickroll idea hahaha
 Noyotens: AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: Noyotens?
 KalamariKing: AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: fried kalamari .gif
 actualCoderTrevor: I see some new faces near the top. I wonder if some people waited until right before gold to push their best code.
 Wontonimo: it's a thing
 AntiSquid: word of mouth, people share with friends ...
 Wontonimo: or give advice on world chat
 Michael_Howard: actualCoderTrever I got from 800s to 180s 5 minutes before the deadline, but it was a surprise to me :money_mouth: The bot just decided to start starting to work.
 actualCoderTrevor: lol nice!
 actualCoderTrevor: I've been afraid to make any changes for the last half hour.
 ClockSort: what rank are you, @actualcodertrevor?
 actualCoderTrevor: 373
 Michael_Howard: I hadn't submitted for hours because my Arena bot kept kicking my ass, then suddenly, bam.
 ClockSort: yeah hold still :D
 actualCoderTrevor: haha thanks&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: strange no gold yet
 Nerchio: by the end of this event i will be 10 years older
 Nerchio: changing variables in my evaluation
 VizGhar: Can somebody help me with that brutaltester? I don;t know what to use for -r switch
 ddreams: -r "java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml -jar spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
 ddreams: that's what I use, at least
 VizGhar: tnx will try
 ddreams: clearly you need to have spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar too
 UndercoverToad: i'm ready, where is the boss?
 VizGhar: so I have to mvn brutaltester as well as spring-2021
 Nerchio: tbh i use just official referee without brutaltester and it works fine
 VizGhar: I've spend whole day debugging why not best nodes were picked... &gt; instead of &lt; o.O
 UndercoverToad: but do you have multithreading Nerchio?
 Nerchio: no but brutaltester kinda doesnt work for me either
 Nerchio: not sure why
 Nerchio: but its not the first time
 Nerchio: maybe my pc is too slow
 Nerchio: :joy:
 UndercoverToad: aren't you a gamer?
 Nerchio: not really anymore no
 UndercoverToad: i think someone mentioned that about you, hm
 KnightMoves: My search algorithm is finally performing better than my if/else algorithm
 DomiKo: aren't we all Coding Gamers?
 KnightMoves: barely...
 KalamariKing: barely &gt; nothing
 AntiSquid: we should port starcraft to CG and make a contest
 UndercoverToad: we had RAIC
 Wontonimo: -r "java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml -jar -Dleague.level=3 spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
 Wontonimo: VizGhar ^^
 KalamariKing: wdym raic
 UndercoverToad: russian AI cup
 ddreams: yeah, I didn't find anything about league.level so I removed the wood leagues from the code 
 UndercoverToad: they had a contest inspired by starcraft
 KalamariKing: oh sick
 VizGhar: tnx Wontonimo
 Counterbalance: still no t-shirt..
 AntiSquid: i thought it's halite inspired
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>you can still watch the battles
 ddreams: and there's always the <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/">https://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/</a>
 Nerchio: still no tshirt +1 :D
 UndercoverToad: right, i'm waiting for that as well Counterbalance
 UndercoverToad: and hoodie
 AntiSquid: how many shirts did they give away this time?
 UndercoverToad: 360 + 60 hoodies
 AntiSquid: oh wow
 AntiSquid: but i think i was busy with work anyway that week
 UndercoverToad: or 0, depending how to parse the question
 Nerchio: i think i got into hoodie territory actually
 Nerchio: but yeah
 UndercoverToad: you did Nerchio
 struct: no hood no shirt
 Nerchio: not expecting anything
 UndercoverToad: even ranked above me :rage:
 Nerchio: yeah actually that was kinda fun
 KalamariKing: imagine putting in all this work to be the rank below the cutoff
 AntiSquid: you wrecked euler Nerchio? nice
 UndercoverToad: by 1 or 2 spots
 Nerchio: in some ways smoother than cg
 UndercoverToad: oh, 7 spots
 jrke: will gold be there in 5-10 mins?
 struct: yo stop submiting please
 UndercoverToad: at least Saksy is online, see #fr
 struct:&#160;:(
 RoboStac: raic are always slow to send things out - I'd completely forgotten I was due to receive a tshirt / hoodie when they arrived after codeball
 AntiSquid: how slow? 
 AntiSquid: does it take 1 year to get your prize? :D
 UndercoverToad: i think it took 10 months last time
 UndercoverToad: i don't remember exactly
 RoboStac: pretty sure it was august after a december/january contest
 RoboStac: maybe later
 UndercoverToad: wait, codeball was before covid
 reCurse: I was thinking of a starcraft micro wars game for CG once
 UndercoverToad: the fighting game took even longer
 RoboStac: yeah, it was 3/4 years ago
 Michael_Howard: Tinfoil theory: They're waiting for Silver to hit 3k before Gold opens so they can write about it.
 Zenoscave: Mornin
 Wontonimo: Tinfoil theory 2: they are considering making bronze boss easier to reach 3k
 Michael_Howard: Anyone got 11 smurfs ready?
 UndercoverToad: i've played a few contests. So far CodinGame was by far the fastest in shipping
 casmith789: what percentage of people will be in gold? 1/3 like last time?
 UndercoverToad: Hackerrank 2nd place
 Zenoscave: casmith789 I bet around 400
 reCurse: Well at least you didn't have to argue with an organizer that there were prizes promised :P
 casmith789: cheers
 struct: please not 1/3
 UndercoverToad: is there a story of yours behind that sentence reCurse?
 casmith789: it felt like a lot got put into silver from bronze tbh
 reCurse: True story but there's not that much more to it
 Wontonimo: bets so farreCu = 200 , Zeno = 400 , Stru = !1/3
 reCurse: It got resolved
 Zenoscave: lol Wontonimo
 aangairbender: cant get brutal tester to work
 struct: 300
 Lysk: 411
 actualCoderTrevor: 401
 UndercoverToad: hm, that's either Halite or a private contest here on CG
 Zenoscave: actualCoderTrevor this isn't the price is right
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh :P
 ddreams: aangairbender error code?
 Rolf: new bet&#160;: 504 to gold
 reCurse: I'm not gonna name anything if you're asking
 actualCoderTrevor: I wasn't sure anyone would get that Zenoscave :P
 Passi10: 589
 jrke: i think everybody above thibaud
 Zenoscave: It's an American TV show I'm not sure how large of a following there is outside
 AntiSquid: halite 
 jrke: lol
 aangairbender: it says ERROR problem with referee output
 ddreams: and what's the output it gives?
 Zenoscave: aangairbender send a snippet of at least 5 lines of the error
 AntiSquid: wonder if the halite discord server is still there
 ddreams: it's printing something to stderr, and you get that problem
 reCurse: It is still alive
 reCurse: They even released the H2 bosses because someone asked
 reCurse: Some genuinely awesome people in there
 ddreams: my guess is too new java version
 Counterbalance: AntiSquid it is
 ddreams: alternatively log4j2 message
 reCurse: Wait let me rephrase
 reCurse: It can still be alive
 reCurse: Except that occurrence it was dead for years
 reCurse: So I may be misrepresenting
 AntiSquid: they are arguing with thibaud since he wants to be the boss&#160;?
 schachmatt: gold not open yet?
 Counterbalance: looking at it now, last message 19 april 2021
 aangairbender: the problem is Referee need log4j2.xml file, but I dont know how to create such file, so used the same one from brutal tester itself
 aangairbender: and it does some extra logging into STDOUT which is not good
 Zenoscave: You can ignore that error usually. IF there's another error beneath it it's fine
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/680bef99-194f-4942-8b1d-90230a025b38">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/680bef99-194f-4942-8b1d-90230a025b38</a>
 Zenoscave: *not an error
 ddreams: aangairbender
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76ff2fda-fa60-408d-9906-f365abe386f6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76ff2fda-fa60-408d-9906-f365abe386f6</a>
 aangairbender: ty, will try
 ddreams: Wontonimo: 450 from me (aka. 15%)
 Zenoscave: ddreams where do you place the file?
 AntiSquid: i said 25% Wontonimo
 ddreams: wherever, you need to refer to it like
 ddreams:  -r "java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml -jar spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
 ddreams: so I have it in the same directory
 Counterbalance: put me down for 300
 Zenoscave: Ah I thought you figured out how to have it just read automatically
 Zenoscave: Wontonimo you're a book keeper now
 schachmatt: Wontonimo this is final number? or when gold first opens
 AntiSquid: everyone's guesses schachmatt
 KnightMoves: I'm thinking 850
 Danifae: 750&#160;?
 reCurse: 250
 jrke: nearly 721
 schachmatt: yeah but guesses for when
 Wontonimo: Counterbalance 300 is already taken, no duplicates
 Counterbalance: aww
 struct: over 400 is extremely high
 rafaelSorel: what going on here :D
 UndercoverToad: over 9000
 reCurse: I changed my bet Wontonimo
 UndercoverToad: i took 300 yesterday already
 aangairbender: now I get ' Negative score during game' for both players
 struct: 301 then
 Wontonimo: git it reCurse!
 KnightMoves: we've got a strategist here
 Wontonimo: *got
 Zenoscave: opening
 ddreams: someone do 299 too
 Noyotens: ANTISQUID
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553358185">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553358185</a>
 Counterbalance: if it's like silver opening, it'll be 150+1000
 elderlybeginner: What's the main factors to consider when building heuristics in the contest?
 casmith789: getting a bt
 schachmatt: Wontonimo I'll take 350 if it's free
 casmith789: getting a better score than your opponent by the end of the game*
 iggy12345: right now, the strategy I'm working on is to look for cells that will never get shade
 iggy12345: and focus on using those
 Rikerslash: so you probably will not find any after 6 turns of the game
 Wontonimo: So far ... here's the bets
 jrke: is gold opening late today?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d8ed557-7b8c-44dd-8f2f-050a936774d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d8ed557-7b8c-44dd-8f2f-050a936774d3</a>
 iggy12345: depends on how good your opponent is
 iggy12345: but there are quite a few
 mhpd: can we create a clash among our friends?
 reCurse: Should do like twitch and bet our cg points
 aangairbender: I am using LSmith-Zenoscave version of referee btw
 casmith789: I will choose 367 as I am 368th rn
 mhpd: can we create a clash among our friends? @casmith789
 Zenoscave: aang Let me see if I can make a branhc that has the logger built in. That's been a big issue for a lot of people
 ddreams: aangairbender run the referee without the brutaltester
 ClockSort: I bet 451
 kisszots: guys, if I want to start running simulations locally do I have to build the whole game myself, or is there some clever way i can use the sourcecode (coding in c++ , not java)
 casmith789: why was that @me?
 Lysk: your bot might have a timeout when running locally aangairbender, you could change time limit in the code and rebuild
 mhpd: calsj
 Wontonimo: i like it reCurse&#160;!  if only CG points could be used like karma
 ddreams: or you're running too many threads?
 Zenoscave: ding 
 rafaelSorel: ding
 casmith789: oh I'm in gold
 Nerchio: ding ding ding
 KnightMoves:&#160;???
 jrke: lol i am promoted to gold
 schachmatt: fall 2021 meta-contest? bots have to guess the number of players in each league
 struct: no way
 ddreams: oh, me too
 ddreams: so &gt;319
 Tuo: everyone in gold?
 Zenoscave: 654
 struct: over 500?
 KnightMoves: oh it fixed itself, it said 3000 in gold at first
 struct: lol
 casmith789: everyone is in gold? lol
 AntiSquid: 750 . Wontonimo 
 iggy12345: are you allowed to multithread in codingame?
 Lysk: hahaha
 AntiSquid: oh gold
 ClockSort: woot
 iggy12345: is there a penalty?
 reCurse: WTF that's a huge gold league
 struct: ^
 jrke: my bet was nearly that
 casmith789: 654
 Danifae: weeeee!
 Zenoscave: no you only have one cpu no multithread iggy12345
 AntiSquid: hm
 iggy12345: that's what I thought
 struct: half of this would be good
 ClockSort: :exploding_head:
 Lysk: 654
 actualCoderTrevor: \o/
 struct: but w/e i made it
 Zenoscave: Yeah what's with these large openings?
 ddreams: 654 kovi just made it
 Bernard_Lowe: I'm pretty sure leagues are based off of how you do against the AI and not the player distribution. Am I correct?
 aangairbender: how to run referee without brutal tester? what argument should I provide
 AntiSquid: lots of players so lots of promotions
 AntiSquid: happened before
 Michael_Howard: Does that mean there's gonna be like 50 this time when Legend opens?
 Wontonimo: WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER (actually virtual tacos) is Passi10 = 589
 UndercoverToad: 650 now is 1000 in a few hours
 AntiSquid: no Michael_Howard . legend is always hard .
 reCurse: Someone get Apo home, clearly drunk
 struct: will be 1200+ in 24 hours
 ddreams: aangairbender run the stuff you have inside -r "java ...."
 jrke: so i won the bet lol
 reCurse: What's next, 200 in legend?
 ddreams: you need to add -p1 and -p2
 DomiKo: another 1K+ league&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: at this point i don't even know anymore if they keep the 15 player legend
 struct: They have a new league after legend
 Chainman: I need to get to gold&#160;:(
 struct: I shouldnt have said it though
 Wontonimo: jrke, you came in second place by just a few points difference.  good call
 rafaelSorel: seems to be a lot of people in gold too
 Zenoscave: struct lies
 AntiSquid: why all the complaints? :D
 UndercoverToad: they can't struct
 struct: im not
 rafaelSorel: use to be arround 100 ~200
 UndercoverToad: was requested for CSB, extra work to implement
 struct: :D
 MoMaT: well, huge bronze, huge silver, huge gold. had to stay consistent now...
 ddreams: the epic league
 struct: euler knows all&#160;:(
 reCurse: That's why you don't hardcode with enums kids
 AntiSquid: what league? like legend2&#160;?
 Zenoscave:&#160;;) reCurse
 ClockSort: legend2
 jrke: league name - 'undercover euler'
 ClockSort: twice as legendary
 UndercoverToad: inoryy told them he would even be fine if it was called wood4 as long as it's smaller
 AntiSquid: i remember a private contrib had 4 legend leagues or so haha
 aangairbender: so.. referee fives me -1 -1
 struct: Nah
 ddreams: aangairbender add "-s"
 AntiSquid: when would legend2 open then? heh ... i don't get it
 jrke: i am bit relieved now
 Zenoscave: when it's a multi
 struct: relieved?
 struct: I dont deserve gold
 Zenoscave: it reset my code
 Imi.obvious: What score do you need to go up to gold from silver? 
 jrke: btw whats the name of gold boss
 Wontonimo: beat the boss Imi.obvious
 ddreams: gold boss is currently Skril
 iggy12345: lol
 Luksis: the name of silver boss :P
 Wontonimo: well, congratulations everyone.  For those now in Gold and for those in Silver who all moved up 654 ranks.
 aangairbender: It seems like it times out
 iggy12345: is there a place that I can find a way to simulate the current boss outside of the website?
 struct: no
 iggy12345: dang
 iggy12345: is there a way that I can get the stderr file from a run in it's entirety?
 Zenoscave: copy and paste
 Mourfette: at what time did they open gold? I was not looking but I just saw that I was gold
 Marchete: gold?
 aangairbender: can I change referee time limitations?
 Marchete: a lot of ppl at gold..
 Wontonimo: yeah, use the replay link, then copy paste the rest json
 schachmatt: about 5 minutes ago Mourfette
 Mourfette: oh ok thanks
 Zenoscave: aangairbender which limitation?
 iggy12345: I've been copy and pasting, but my code doesn't start misbehaving until 50-60 turns
 Marchete: 655 few :D
 UndercoverToad: you can go up to 150ms easily
 Luksis: 18H40
 schachmatt: or 10
 aangairbender: I mean 100ms per turn
 Zenoscave: how UndercoverToad?
 AllYourTrees: how does difficulty of getting gold in this comp compare to last comp?
 UndercoverToad: then you have to modify some more code
 aangairbender: my bot does 143ms locally
 aangairbender: idk why
 Marchete: in this comp it was "easy"
 Marchete: my heuristic code is bottom gold
 mhpd: can we create a custom clash??
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L37">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L37</a>
 AllYourTrees: same march
 UndercoverToad: if you go too high, you hit SDK constraints
 aangairbender: ty
 struct: my bot was gold level&#160;:(
 Marchete: heuristic is like 4 hours of coding for something competent
 Noyotens: BOOSOOT is the new boot
 mhpd: oh man pls reply anyone
 UndercoverToad: which you can get around my importing the SDK manually and not via Maven
 mhpd: can we create a custom clash?
 mhpd: can we create a custom clash?
 mhpd: can we create a custom clash?
 mhpd: can we create a custom clash?
 elderlybeginner: looks much easier
 Marchete: ask on #clash
 Zenoscave: mhpd there's an active contest no one cares here 
 jrke: mhpd yes scroll down in clash page
 Wontonimo: wow, chat too busy
 UndercoverToad: jrke don't reward that behaviour
 Marchete: UndercoverToad can I invite you to a clash?
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/614074c4f45bc5120d6d04e98ee334347d54">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/614074c4f45bc5120d6d04e98ee334347d54</a>how to remove SDK constraints entirely
 Marchete: 2700 bronze, 2300 silver, 650 gold, 14 legend...
 jrke: can i do like playing N games with different localhost offline to see there replays?
 UndercoverToad: i wish
 UndercoverToad: @ Marchete
 ClockSort: maybe gold is large because total player counts are high
 Marchete: Euler wait two days until a lot of heavyweight bots appears from nowhere :D
 UndercoverToad: i don't think that this would work jrke. replays are always at /tmp/codingame/game.json
 jrke: hmm
 UndercoverToad: a legend without me?
 UndercoverToad: would be sad
 struct: im hiding since testing
 jrke: a legend without toad
 Marchete: who said that?
 UndercoverToad: "a lot of heavyweight bots appears"
 UndercoverToad: thus stronger than me and i can't enter legend
 Marchete: thus you'd keep improving
 struct: euler you always get legend
 UndercoverToad: at codebusters I didn't
 Marchete: 4 years ago?
 struct: did you try?
 UndercoverToad: i didn't have an account back then
 jrke: exceptions are always there euler
 struct: ...
 UndercoverToad: but WW was a real struggle for me
 ZarthaxX: i lost the tshirt there
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 aangairbender: referee still says -1 -1, seems like problem is not in timeouts
 Zenoscave: did you add the -Dleague.level=3 flag? aangairbender
 Zenoscave: it defaults to wood rules
 aangairbender: oh really
 aangairbender: Unrecognized option: -Dleague.level=3
 Zenoscave: put it right after java in the ref string
 Zenoscave: java -Dleague.leve=3 -jar ...
 aangairbender: ok ty
 Zenoscave: yw
 CharmyRosewolf: Hey guys, do you have to use a fancy algorithm to get into silver? I'm so close, but I can't seem to get there.
 ddreams: no
 ddreams: you can get to top 10 with only heuristics
 AntiSquid: even for gold top 200 you clearly can just write up few conditions
 aangairbender: I build in debug mode thats why I get timeouts
 CharmyRosewolf: That's good to know. This is my first time with a game comp, so just being able to get to silver would be a great accomplishment for me.
 elderlybeginner: Which few conditions? :wink:
 CharmyRosewolf: Thanks dreams! I will look into heuristics.
 AntiSquid: ping the people there to say it out loud
 CharmyRosewolf: And now I feel a little more hopeful :D
 Noyotens: how to be in gold
 ddreams: CharmyRosewolf: like evaluate each of the possible action and select the one that seems best
 Zenoscave: CharmyRosewolf they mean just basic logic. no searching by heuristics 
 reCurse: tfw you realize every bot is doing heuristics D:
 solistice: anyone here done MCTS in C# that can tell me how long 1 rollout takes for them?
 CharmyRosewolf: Ahhh that's sort of what I'm working on already. I just didn't realize that is what it's called.
 solistice: I can't seem to get mine under 10ms
 struct: o.o
 ddreams: did you manage to profile it?
 K3K: im doing if/else (even disregarding the whole shadow mech) and i'm in gold league . - .
 Michael_Howard: Why have I shot up from 187 to 140 without doing anything?
 K3K: but im hardstuck at the bottom tho :laughing:
 solistice: im manually profiling it
 AntiSquid: ya this is a heuristics contest disguised as sim contest
 reCurse: Everyone is on heuristics, get your terminology right
 solistice: guess my code is just shit
 aangairbender: brutal tester is working now, ty guys
 aangairbender: no need to submit like crazy anymore
 ddreams: aangairbender yw, but it'd be rude to beat us now
 Michael_Howard: I don't mean I resubmitted, I mean I just sitting there since promotion.
 aangairbender: ddreams I am already rank 29 so...:sweat_smile:
 ddreams: Michael_Howard other people have resubmitted most likely
 ddreams: so rude
 daniserrano7: Discussion: targeting center seems the reasonable thing to do, but I see bots better than me prefer to stay around. Any thoughts on this?
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth gold count is your favorite number
 aangairbender: daniserrano7 center trees got shadowed a lot
 BlaiseEbuth: Guess what, dbdr just said me the same on #Fr ZarthaxX :D
 aangairbender: while those on the edge often get sun
 Michael_Howard: daniserrano7 centre can get very spooky
 daniserrano7: thats my guess. Im trying to figure out if more richness compensate shadowing
 ddreams: it depends&#160;:)
 daniserrano7: I think that question and when-to-complete-trees are main keys
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth hahah good
 miszu: well the good news is I am 125th in silver. So there is hope for me for the gold dreams
 ddreams: I'm sure you'll make it
 miszu: thank you for beliving in me
 miszu: funny part is... I just run vs the boss right now I beat him... so why am I so low in ranks lol
 miszu: this is the first game
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553397197">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553397197</a>
 Cjx_1: making too many seeds now!! I swear, I leave this forest spirit alone for ten minutes......
 ddreams: hmm.. I'm sometimes completing before growing to size 3
 AntiSquid: BlaiseEbuth i'll convert to christinaity and fight you with a flash light, shine light into the darkness
 Maciulis: hmm it was enough to badly copy top3 strategy on saturday and you can free ride the wave to gold. #unmotivated&#160;:( 
 ddreams: err, opposite
 BlaiseEbuth: AntiSquid I'm OK with that, if I can come to your baptism. :rofl:
 Ellisdi: hi
 Ellisdi: where to find help for the "Temperatures"-puzzle?
 AntiSquid: stole your number BlaiseEbuth
 AntiSquid: i win
 AntiSquid: nvm
 AntiSquid: damn dropped 1 more :D
 ddreams: Maciulis I'll see you in legend then 
 Noyotens: i stole bot alghoritm :grimacing:
 miszu: so with my code that I am sitting 135th in silver I beat the boss 6/10 tries
 miszu: any opinion about that?
 Maciulis: Nah legend is for the OG's 
 ddreams: beat him 10/10
 ddreams: that's my opinion
 Maciulis: miszu 6/10 is inconsistent results 
 miszu: lol just got a message from linkedin microsoft wants to recruit me. I hope they are in for disapointments
 miszu: I could improve my code based on growing the better trees and chop chop them earlier. I mostly do it towards the end
 Maciulis: maybe u can revive skype
 miszu: I could if they let me do it my way :D
 7amasa: How many people are gonna be in legend approx.&#160;?
 Maciulis: with how it is going atleast 69
 7amasa: or 420
 UndercoverToad: i would have said 15 on opening. but with that large gold i'm not sure anymore
 UndercoverToad: in the past it was 10-15 players
 jrke: gn gtg for sleep
 ddreams: sleep is for the weak
 7amasa: oh shit thats pretty low
 aangairbender: ddreams 02:33AM yeah...
 miszu: I gonna resubmit hoping I will reach gold with current state
 Noyotens: 5:34 Pm
 Noyotens: is time to be in gold
 aangairbender: miszu gl
 Noyotens: but i dont know how :cry:
 miszu: thanks
 Noyotens: :happy:
 KCrown: wow I gained like 800 spots over nite
 UndercoverToad: no, gold opened above you
 ddreams: better get that checked out
 KCrown: lol is that it

 UndercoverToad: your global rank
 Marchete: the ghost turns in this game is annoying
 Marchete: I have state hash differences due to that if I compare P1 &amp; P2
 ddreams: why?
 Marchete: simulation checks
 solistice: at least ur simulation runs in faster than 10 ms per random playout&#160;:') 
 ddreams: you can figure out everything he did
 Marchete: haven't tested it yet
 Marchete: it's bitboard, but I have no idea
 KCrown: yeah i suck ... looks like you have to sim to get more rankings
 ddreams: a top 10 player have no sim
 ddreams: or search
 UndercoverToad: the TypeScript guy
 Noyotens: how to deafet BOSSOT
 ddreams: Noyotens get a higher score than him
 Noyotens: how
 ddreams: you get score by cutting down trees
 KCrown: hmm really Ddreams?
 Noyotens: i know
 UndercoverToad: does this answer your question Noyotens? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553409284">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553409284</a>
 Noyotens: can u send replay how u deafet him
 Noyotens: thx
 UndercoverToad: i just did
 miszu: Noyotens study the boss and see suboptimal moves and try to improve based on that
 Noyotens: ok
 Noyotens: thank u guys
 miszu: I need to figure out how to rank all the grow commands. Like which one are better than others
 miszu: and lastly, when is it the right time to do chop chop
 solistice: do you guys evaluate actions? or states?
 aangairbender: we evaluate states
 solistice: and can someone show me an example of such bitboard?
 solistice: might be the reason I'm so slow
 struct: uint64_t inside = 0b0001111000001111100001111110001111111000111111000011111000001111;
 reCurse: I'm not convinced the 0b notation make things clearer
 struct: bit 0 is bottom right cell of the grid
 reCurse: Though maybe using ' separators
 ZarthaxX: ohh that was the separator i didnt remember
 ZarthaxX: ty
 reCurse: The programmer calc in windows 10 is also quite helpful for that
 KCrown: IMHO bitboards insnt useful unless ur doing sims
 struct: not true on this game
 struct: imo
 struct: hex is a pain
 reCurse: Bitfields can also be useful for a heuristic
 KCrown: what do you bitboard in this game? struct?
 struct: the board
 ddreams: trees
 reCurse: A single popcount can save you writing an annoying loop
 reCurse: etc
 KCrown: so with bit you know say 10 of ur bits is set cause you have 10 trees ... now what?
 struct: yes
 jacek: oh boy
 ddreams: to get the shade from those 10 trees you can do one shift
 struct: now I dont need loops
 KCrown: so with bit you know say 10 of ur bits is set cause you have 10 trees ... now what? the problem is you still need to locate ur trees
 KCrown: and i cna do both with a look
 struct: ok you trolling
 KCrown: and i can do both with a loop 
 ddreams: of course, but a loop is much slower than a shift
 reCurse: Slower to write too
 ddreams: how fast you write small functions like this is inconsequential imo
 KCrown: yes boits is a _little_ faster but you have to loop to do ur shift too 
 reCurse: Kind of funny you mention that, I disagree
 reCurse: I find I think a lot better the less code I have to look at
 reCurse: Especially vertical space
 ddreams: sure, but you don't see a function you have defined in the top of your code
 KCrown: IMHO ... these contest is more about not making a bug than gaining that little speed ... unless again if ur doing sims
 ddreams: so it's the same if you write your own count or use __popcount64
 ddreams: clearly you want whatever you're looking at to be clean enough
 KCrown: knowing that you have 10 tree isnt that useful you need to know where the trees are in relation to each other
 reCurse: I don't know how else to explain it&#160;:)
 reCurse: I regularly read the entire code again
 ddreams: KCrown ok, thanks for the tip
 reCurse: So the less I have to the better
 ddreams: I practically never do that
 KCrown: just a opinion from someone whos ranked very low&#160;:( 
 reCurse: I don't know why or what you're arguing about KCrown
 reCurse: If it doesn't suit you don't do it
 XeroOl: I've run into a case of perverse incentives
 ddreams: XeroOl share a replay?&#160;:)
 XeroOl: I want to switch to a sim, but to do that, I'm going to have to switch to a fast language, which means I'll be less likely to get the language achievements
 XeroOl: ddreams, more of a meta thing than a particular game lol
 reCurse: What's more important to you?
 XeroOl: I don't know, I'm going to have to decide
 ddreams: if there's any time when you don't need a sim, this is it
 Lucky30_: any hints on how to convert from cell index to {x y z}hexagonal position

 Marc1232: how do i close chat&#160;?
 Noyotens: now can i go to gold
 reCurse: Add ?disableChat to URL
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553424015">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553424015</a>
 XeroOl: @Lucky30_ I think the best way is to add a look up table
 ddreams: or click the little triangle to hide it
 XeroOl: an array of 37 points
 AntiSquid: who's bot became boss?
 Lucky30_: should i just right it manualy??
 ddreams: tbh that's what I did, though to col/row representation
 Lucky30_: i am too lazy hhh
 ddreams: I was too lazy to figure it out properly
 Lucky30_: same
 Cjx_1: how do ya make our spirits talk?
 ddreams: add text after your command
 Cjx_1: &lt;3
 ddreams: look at their output
 jacek: with their mouth
 Lucky30_: print("action message")
 XeroOl: how far can you get with heuristics in this challenge?
 UndercoverToad: gold for sure
 XeroOl: my understanding is that sims will get further
 UndercoverToad: legend: maybe but will be hard
 reCurse: This meme just won't die
 aangairbender: top 10 is heuristic (TypeScipt guy)
 XeroOl: ahh, fair enough then
 XeroOl: awesome, I guess I'll stay in heuristic land
 XeroOl: thanks
 jacek: why not both
 Cjx_1: the arena takes a hot minute to run through&#160;:/
 Westicles: What meme?  The scrappy heuristic guys against the evil simmers?
 AntiSquid: i am sure lots of heuristic bots make it to legend, just watch
 Zenoscave: Westicles you like pots?
 Zenoscave: you're stirring one&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: if simmers are evil what would NN in contests be? Westicles
 Noyotens: :sad:
 KCrown: my problem is I want to win and I think a sim will will ... but sims isn't fun to code. Hoever, heuristic is fun to figure out and code ... 
 miszu: problem with heuristics is to figure out a good one
 UndercoverToad: we have different understanding of fun
 Cjx_1: and one that works universally
 aangairbender: sim cant win alone, search can, but search is sim + heuristics
 UndercoverToad: to me it feels tedious to find all these cases by hand and make decisions
 aangairbender: so a bit of fun for all
 miszu: unless you MCTS it, then no need for heuristics
 KCrown: this game cries out for MCTS 
 UndercoverToad: no
 reCurse: aangairbender is a beacon of light in a sea of darkness here
 UndercoverToad: huge branching, i don't see how to make MCTS work here
 struct: not worth
 UndercoverToad: i might be wrong but I don't head the cry for it
 struct: I tried it during testing
 ZarthaxX: ninjadogg y has it UndercoverToad struct
 Asterixk: how would you bitboard in js?
 reCurse: Ouch
 Cjx_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25322531/chess-bitboard-implementation-in-java">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25322531/chess-bitboard-implementation-in-java</a>
 ZarthaxX: lol java
 struct: :D
 Cjx_1: required very few keystrokes :P
 ZarthaxX: this is too funny
 ZarthaxX: java&#160;!= javascript
 CouscousAgha: do you guys sim the entire game at the beginning or just x rounds ahead?
 struct: I sim until end
 UndercoverToad: end for me too
 LLG: I still have no ideas how you guys do 300k+ sims 
 struct: my eval is bad
 LLG: my bot is crying for help at 10k ish
 struct: i dont check for duplicates
 UndercoverToad: i'm on your level LLG
 Asterixk: can python bitboard?
 UndercoverToad: but even with that about you can do something reasonable
 Zenoscave: Asterixk any language can
 LLG: yeah my eval has a lot of room for improvement
 UndercoverToad: the question is: would you want to do that?
 LLG: I just can't figure out how yet
 miszu: my rerun ended me up 15th in silver
 reCurse: Any language? Even those where numbers are doubles?
 miszu: rpo
 Asterixk: lol nvm python
 miszu: rip*
 Zenoscave: reCurse you're right. I knew that sentence would bite me in th arse
 XeroOl: lua technically has bitwise operators
 miszu: wait hold up... just got promoted to gold
 XeroOl: if that's what we're talking about here
 miszu: wtf
 miszu: I finished 15th and CG decided to promote me anyways
 miszu: alright guys, I guess I made it to gold
 ZarthaxX: gz!
 Asterixk: in js without IEEE bitmaigc one would be limited to bitmasking bytes
 UndercoverToad: congrats, you have 2 more days to play with top bots before they vanish
 XeroOl: does js not have int?
 AntiSquid: Asterixk i've seen some really weird stuff with web assembly ... maybe that&#160;?
 Asterixk: in js all number is 64bit double
 miszu: UndercoverToad I mainly use your bot and study how to improve mine
 UndercoverToad: oh, thanks for the honors
 UndercoverToad: i have some IDE timeouts
 Asterixk: webasm does CG handle that?
 miszu: I find yours to have the most deterministic behavior
 reCurse: Technically yes
 AntiSquid: ya i think so Asterixk
 UndercoverToad: it's close to deterministic, yes
 reCurse: Would be considered obfuscating under contest rules though
 UndercoverToad: a bit of randomness because I get a layer more or less in my beam
 AntiSquid: and all the bitboarding avx magic isn't&#160;? 
 XeroOl: does the contest say no obfuscating?
 reCurse: Yes
 struct: no AntiSquid
 XeroOl: does deleting whitespace to fit in the size count as obfuscation?
 reCurse: No
 miszu: right but also it seems the current state has the most weight in your eval. I can almost always tell what is your next move
 Asterixk: i see, interesting but thats another rabithole maybe harder than chaining bytemasks
 XeroOl: does having a large hardcoded neural network that does all the heuristics count as obfuscation?
 AntiSquid: better ask staff, doubt it makes sense to call it obfuscating
 XeroOl: where the entire code is a giant array of mystery numbers
 Westicles: Obfuscating is pretty vague.  I had a contribution rejected, they said I obfuscated the solution by using single-space indents
 Zenoscave: euler why do you only use 50ms?
 reCurse: Obfuscating usually means extreme examples where the code is literally unreadable
 AntiSquid: NNs are definitely not considered obfuscation since there were NN in past contests, so why would webasm be&#160;?
 reCurse: For example, encoding an executable binary
 UndercoverToad: because I want to refactor that part anyways
 miszu: like people's code without unit testing :D
 struct: basicly my code
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 miszu: *miszu got kicked out *
 Noyotens: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 reCurse: Webasm would fall under that
 reCurse: Most forms of code transformation would fall under that
 Noyotens: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 Noyotens: error
 UndercoverToad: you have to wait a few minutes
 reCurse: Or a few hours
 Noyotens: ok
 Noyotens: soooo
 UndercoverToad: and then you should play less games not to get it again
 Asterixk: yeah that's a bit farfetched just for bitboarding concerns
 AntiSquid: about an hour for me each time, min
 ddreams: is that IDE plays?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 Noyotens: the time is to slow
 UndercoverToad: they lowered the limits
 reCurse: Isn't that increased
 reCurse: Philosophical :thinking:
 UndercoverToad: lowered number of plays allowed
 struct: already 790 in gold
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 UndercoverToad: we are an inclusive community now
 Westicles: Pretty good streamer on.  He's in gold with 350 lines of python.  
 ZarthaxX: oh nice
 Whatar: HexTree is a cool guy
 Whatar: what do you think Automatonn2000
 jacek: UndercoverToad not more 5% eh
 Smelk: Hello! 
 UndercoverToad: 5% of what?
 Smelk: My code got reset when switching to gold&#160;:( Is there a way to get back the current submitted version?
 struct: yes
 struct: click history on the left
 Smelk: Ooh perfect, thank you very much!
 Chainman: wait how does the timeout work?
 UndercoverToad: you are slow, you lose the game
 Chainman: lol
 Chainman: I mean I'm getting 2-3 seconds for an entire day I think. but it doesn't timeout?
 jacek: huh?
 Kafeine: 100ms per turn
 UndercoverToad: start the timer after reading the first line of input
 Chainman: at the start of the day?
 Chainman: 1000 ms per day?
 UndercoverToad: for each turn
 Kafeine: 1st input start of timer for the turn
 Chainman: oops
 Kafeine: 100ms per turn
 Chainman: nvm 1000ms is for first turn
 alchemsti: I saw multiple statements that top 10 "Typescript guy" is heuristics. How do we know that?
 XeroOl: because it's typescript lol
 UndercoverToad: because he confirmed that here on chat
 jacek: you can see others's code by pressint alt+F4
 XeroOl: please don't, lol
 UndercoverToad: grow up jacek
 UndercoverToad: to a size 3 tree
 UndercoverToad: and then complete yourself
 jacek: not enough sun points
 Chainman: okay getting 43 ms for a turn now
 Chainman: looks like the turn before it times out it is 96 ms
 Chainman: I can't print after it passes 100ms to see how much it went over?
 jacek: no it will timeout before that
 reCurse: Would be a nice feature but no
 jacek: sometimes you can get lucky and it can be 5-10% over 100ms
 Chainman: crap, will need more messy debug to see how much it goes over 100ms
 Chainman: But this is unforunate cause my beam search is depth=1 and width=1 I think.  I did something wrong. 
 Chainman: nvm it was depth=2, it passes at depth=1. 
 Chainman: too slow
 sprkrd: Unless you've written an extremely efficient sim, using bitwise operations and all that, it can get easily over 100ms even with depth 1
 sprkrd: Depth 1 is actually depth 2 because moves are simultaneous, so you have to simulate |A|x|A| transitions (being |A| the average number of actions per player)
 sprkrd: Unless you effectively mean depth = 1 is half a movement&#160;:)
 Chainman: yes depth=1 is like depth=2
 Chainman: for my algo
 Chainman: so it is really good at depth=2 technically at like 3 ms
 Chainman: but as soon I go to depth=3, it times out at day 8
 sprkrd: That sounds about right. That's when the number of actions grow too large. At the start is just a few actions per turn (most turns will be only the WAIT action)
 Zenoscave: sprkrd many players assume opponent is a WAIT only bot
 UndercoverToad: but the opponent is mean and doesn't just WAIT
 orangesnowfox: tfw I just gave up on the compo and am doing random bots
 UndercoverToad: can I get another opponent please?
 Zenoscave: lol toad
 Zenoscave: I think the matchmaking knows when I feel good about my submit and decides to rek it
 ZarthaxX: i like your hypothesis
 GamingBob: I agree wholeheartedly.
 dbdr: good thing with gold: smaller league to climbbad thing with gold: I play Mazelcop on match 1
 Mazelcop: :D
 UndercoverToad: mazel tov
 UndercoverToad: i got the round orange fruit
 UndercoverToad: or is it a ball?
 dbdr: ping ponb maybe
 Xezs2774: hi
 Xezs2774: how long you guys been here
 AntiSquid: too long
 Queuebee: (reaction to msgs from 1 h back) you talked about heuristic solutions being in legend, would that be without any simulation? Or just like a one-turn look ahead
 AntiSquid: maybe 1 turn look ahead is plenty
 Kuraishi: Can you complete a dormant tree?
 pmor: no
 orangesnowfox: It's... Dormant
 Kuraishi: ty
 DamianS6: Guys, I've made it to the silver with simple if/else bot, I could try improving it but I doubt I'd get to the gold anyway and simulations and algorithms you're all talking about seem to be cooler :wink: How can I begin with some AI algorithms? Do you maybe know some simple tutorial I could make use of here? I've never done it, I did some googling but it doesn't seem so simple to learn it in 2-3 days... I code in python if it matters
 jacek: :thinking_face:
 gmessier: Maybe try: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 jacek: people here use something called beam search
 Westicles: people here write crazy fast optimized code, but python is like, what, 20x slower than the good ones?
 Counterbalance: DamianS6 I'd stick with heuristics for now if I were you - that's enough to get gold, which would be a good achievement for a first contest.
 King_Coda: *sigh*
 King_Coda: ugh
 King_Coda: I hate people sometimes
 King_Coda: How's everyone doing with the contest
 WolfDarrigan: Being optimistic, but not optimized and as such holding up the bottom of Bronze
 Westicles: Top4 is all French and US.  All other countries are doing terrible
 dbdr: Westicles top 4 has max 4 countries
 Counterbalance: :joy:
 dbdr:  Top4 is all French and HU.  All other countries are doing terrible 
 Uljahn: Top1 is Java. All other languages are doing terrible
 dbdr: :D
 Marchete: I'm ashamed of 2nd and 4rd
 dbdr: Marchete?
 Marchete: *3rd :D
 Marchete: just quit dbdr
 Marchete: you are 4th
 Astrobytes: 3rst or 4rd, make yer mind up
 Marchete: you dishonored your country
 dbdr: #5 -&gt; #ragequit
 dbdr: wait
 Marchete: according to westicle_s it's the same
 Marchete: also france has 2500 players
 Astrobytes: How many playing in total?
 Marchete: 6343
 Astrobytes: Not bad.
 Astrobytes: Oh siman incoming
 Marchete: hungary 92 -&gt; 3 top50
 Marchete: 1 top 10
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: japan 400 -&gt; 9 top 50
 NinjaDoggy: woah java first :open_mouth:
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: nice
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the Japanese guys have really gone in hard the last few competitions!
 Marchete: 11th typescript, impressive too
 Westicles: CG started advertising on used underwear vending machines
 dbdr: #16 perl
 Astrobytes: What contest was the chokuda i search used on initially? The one that was really popular on jp twitter
 dbdr: pacman I think
 DomiKo: HS
 Astrobytes: Hypersonic? Recently?
 BrunoFelthes: GO GO Java
 jacek: or java java go?
 Astrobytes: Gabba Gabba Hey?
 Marchete: the referee auto pass a day when players only have WAIT moves and still not oppIsWaiting?
 VizGhar: yes... it only says, that you have more actions available then him
 VizGhar: you can be as**** during those moves :D
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: WAIT   GROW
 Astrobytes: Just don't give your opponent head right VizGhar :rofl:
 Marchete: asleep WAIT &lt;--- This is just skipped or not?
 VizGhar: right :D
 Marchete: if one player is asleep and the other only have a WAIT as possible
 Marchete: ahh
 Astrobytes: that ends the day
 xkral-tr: hi
 Marchete: but the referee auto do that, or it expects the last WAIT?
 Astrobytes: ask struct
 Marchete: struct
 struct: yes?
 Marchete: about asleep and WAITs
 Marchete: turn N0: WAIT   GROW
 struct: I dont know
 Marchete: ahh OK
 struct: it probably waits for wait
 Gedzius: "The sun's direction will therefore always be equal to the current day modulo 6." does anyone know what this means in simpler terms&#160;?
 Marchete: day%6
 Gedzius: ophhhh
 Astrobytes: current day&#160;% 6
 Gedzius: im retarded
 Gedzius: ok thanks
 Astrobytes: argh, I am too slow
 HackingHues: wait do trees in shadows still earn sun points...
 jacek: no oO
 AlMualem: to my understanding no
 pmor: only if they are larger than the tree castin gthe shadow
 AlMualem: guys,whats the big difference between bronze and silver regarding the rules?
 HackingHues: ah that makes logical sense. Is it the full sun points of size minus shadow size
 Wontonimo: none
 pmor: same rules
 Marchete: ok I think I have the problem in my state, the asleep player has no idea what's going on
 Wontonimo: just harder opponent bots
 AlMualem: so,just the bot becomes better...
 Marchete: but as the referee isn't sending me the state is expected
 Marchete: why did they do that?
 AlMualem: so i have to come up with a better strategy....ok...thanks guys! &lt;3
 Marchete: if I can't do anything just send the gamestate with "asleep" or whatever
 Wontonimo: AlMualem, the upside of being in Gold is that your bot won't get pulled down by a crazy loss to a super weak bot, because there arn't any
 Marchete: I'm bottom gold
 Marchete: so I can't do worse
 Wontonimo: best place to try out new stuff
 Counterbalance: yeah referee sends 1 legal action WAIT
 Skril: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553519906">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553519906</a> frame 60, really wanted a seed there&#160;:-)
 ddreams: spam seeding
 Marchete: game of acorns
 ddreams: nice bot skril
 ddreams: what are the numbers you're saying?
 ddreams: thought the first was turn/day or something, but no
 Marchete: cthulhu invocation
 CouscousAgha: what's the&#160;% of gold players that will advance to legend?
 Marchete: 14
 VizGhar: very very small
 CouscousAgha: top 14%?
 Marchete: top 14
 Skril: ddreams tahnks&#160;:-) in arena it's count of bad opponent prediction/turn, in this replay it's incomes
 Marchete: it's usually really small
 Marchete: 20 players at first
 Marchete: then it starts growing
 Marchete: to aroun 80 - 100 players
 CouscousAgha: and if u get to legend u cant demote to gold?
 ddreams: I see
 Marchete: no demote
 Skril: then number of days simulated and  depth
 Marchete: you can even crash your bot, you are a legend
 CouscousAgha: my goal is to get to legend without any sims
 CouscousAgha: just a heuristic 
 Marchete: you need to go top 40
 CouscousAgha: that's gonna be the challenge 
 VizGhar: well gl then
 VizGhar: i believe impossible
 King_Coda: hhhh
 King_Coda: Do you ever just get on a roll with coding, then suddenly just lose the will to do anything
 King_Coda: I was doing great until suddenly I guess I just aren't anymore
 Whiskee: coding is a continuous swing between feeling like a god and feeling like a moron, yes
 KCrown: they must have just expanded gold 
 CouscousAgha: btw why my lvl is stuck at 4?
 Marchete: 99% moron here
 King_Coda: Ugh, everything just feels gray now
 King_Coda: I need a more reliable distraction
 King_Coda: I know, I'll just go make a webpage
 King_Coda: Only 10% of codingamers actually do CoCs
 Marchete: nah, this sim is not working :unamused:
 Marchete: I can sim 1 turn, but if at turn 0 I want to sim until endgame, I don't get the same final state
 NinjaDoggy: O.o
 NinjaDoggy: wait how...
 CouscousAgha: anyone can tell me how to I unstuck my account lvl
 CouscousAgha: it's been lvl 4 for ages
 CameronWatt: what bitwise/logical operator makes two values of false, true?
 Marchete: predefined moves
 Marchete: If I know what move to pick on both players
 Weirdo1_1: Hello Everone
 WolfDarrigan: nand?
 Marchete: In theory I can sim all
 Marchete: it's just for simtesting
 NinjaDoggy: @CouscousAgha you gain exp by completing puzzles in practice or getting to higher leagues in contests
 CameronWatt: interesting yeah
 Westicles: nor
 CameronWatt: nor is closer yep
 CameronWatt: thanks guys
 CouscousAgha: even if im 111/111 xp i should do an achievement?
 NinjaDoggy: also level doesn't really matter&#160;:/
 NinjaDoggy: just do contests&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: YES! Got Captchas! Now the real game begins!
 Westicles: I am best at the tractors
 reCurse: Should do clash of captchas as a new game mode
 CameronWatt: LOL
 NinjaDoggy: :O reCurse is here to chat :O
 Nerchio: ashelkov must be a magician with typescript in top10
 NinjaDoggy: or is he secretly winning the contest again :thinking:
 reCurse: I'm mostly just shitposting
 reCurse: Helpful at times
 NinjaDoggy: nice nice
 reCurse: (I hope)
 dreadylein: this was google recaptcha&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Spamming submits
 CameronWatt: ive attempted to write selenium code that clicks recaptchas... didn't work so well
 dreadylein: you need to set the dom values back to the values they had when it wasnt automated
 reCurse: So much effort to save a few cents an hour
 dreadylein: eh captchas are fun&#160;:) 
 dreadylein: aside of that, you aint wrong :P
 XeroOl: screw heuristics, it's hardcoding time&#160;:)
 [CG]Thibaud: +1
 AntiSquid: what's the difference&#160;?
 dbdr: are you playing [CG]Thibaud?
 reCurse: The only way this makes sense is if you're hardcoding perfect play
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah I decided I didn't want to stay in Bronze
 XeroOl: @reCurse, I'm hardcoding in somewhat-decent play for the first 5 or so days
 reCurse: Then that's just a heuristic
 miszu: I like how there is repulsion of being in bronze
 [CG]Thibaud: but I do the minimum. No classes, no computing of shadows
 King_Coda: I'm just glad that 14 year old girls aren't hitting on anyone in chat
 KCrown: FBI!
 King_Coda: That was a huge problem a week ago... :frowning:
 Nerchio: this man right here
 Marchete: wth I'm always off by 2,2 suns
 Marchete: on a full rollout
 King_Coda: SO many 14 year old girls
 Marchete: I think it's because these 2 suns at start...
 miszu: wait what? What 14 years old girl?
 King_Coda: :worried: i'll never understand them
 XeroOl: on codingame?
 XeroOl: that happens?
 Marchete: nvm, it's not always 2 suns :S
 King_Coda: They came into chat a week ago and started hitting on everyone
 King_Coda: yeah on codingame
 King_Coda: It was reaaaaallly weird
 King_Coda: It got so bad that I had to send screenshots to the community manager
 AntiSquid: ya well do you think any girls come here and do that&#160;?
 miszu: how bad was it?
 AntiSquid: you don't know who's on the other side of the line
 reCurse: A dog
 CameronWatt: that is weird
 King_Coda: AntiSquid
 reCurse: It's always a dog
 AntiSquid: always a dog
 King_Coda: They were girls, i can assure you
 miszu: "I have no idea what I'm doing" meme dog
 King_Coda: They all seemed to target me for whatever reason
 King_Coda: I guess it's because I'm the closest to their age range
 CameronWatt: anyone have other website favorites to practice code
 AntiSquid: your orange K avatar stands out King_Coda
 VizGhar: big brain time
 AntiSquid: seriously i would be suspicious of such things and so should be you, might be some weirdo
 VizGhar: like that kitkat user :D
 icecream17: woah, my code is 207th?
 reCurse: You think someone would just log on chat and spread lies
 pmor: the internet is where the boys are men, the men are boys, and girls are fbi agents.
 VizGhar: lol nice one
 Hugo-NL: and where women are always whores? 
 reCurse: This devolved in 3 lines
 reCurse: Get your shit together guys
 reCurse: Jesus
 King_Coda: Wow that happened
 King_Coda: They all invited me into discord calls, so I can assure you they were women
 VizGhar: yup that was over line
 Astrobytes: WTF have I just come back to
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 King_Coda: And yes, we used video chat
 AntiSquid: like honeypot for something&#160;?
 King_Coda: They wouldn't shut the hell up about it
 King_Coda: I just ended up blocking them&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: :thinking: they weren't your alts were they?
 King_Coda: LOL
 King_Coda: No Squid
 AntiSquid: ok i trust you
 Westicles: You spent like 10 days counting down to your supposed 16 birthday.  What did you expect?
 King_Coda: HEY
 King_Coda: It was only 2 days
 King_Coda: :unamused:

 Astrobytes: Every day I log into this webchat my opinion of it worsens.
 AntiSquid: what you just type your age in chat and then women from same age start hitting on you? is that how it works?
 reCurse: Careful of underflow
 Illedan: Word Astrobytes
 NinjaDoggy: recurse :joy:
 King_Coda: I guess so AntiSquid?
 reCurse: I'm only here because there's usually more adults during contests
 ClockSort: i experienced some antigravity... went from 200-th place Silver into Gold division without changing the code
 reCurse: After contest I'm out of here
 reCurse: Mood got better after I stopped reading some of this
 Astrobytes: reCurse: it's ridiculous dude
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 KCrown: next challenge will be to write a 14 year old girl chat bot
 King_Coda: LOL
 AntiSquid: hey i am 20 and my birthday is tomorrow
 miszu: I feel old now
 CameronWatt: time to drink until you sink
 King_Coda: Squid, NO
 King_Coda: You don't want to experience the horrors I did
 NinjaDoggy: sry if asked already but why aren't you competing in this contest reCurse? :sweat_smile:
 Illedan: Anyone did NLP in C#?
 ClockSort: recurse is competing of course&#160;;)
 reCurse: My new policy is to only answer contest-related questions after contest
 Astrobytes: Hah
 King_Coda: I think there just happened to be a bunch of lonely teenagers in chat last week, and I just happened to be there
 Marchete: then he is contesting :D
 Westicles: He's doing a NN and he's gonna come in 2nd
 reCurse: Let me correct your logic
 reCurse: In order for me to maintain non-commital option
 AntiSquid: why are you looking for c# NLP&#160;?
 reCurse: I need to remain exactly vague every contest
 reCurse: e.g. I was just as active during OOC and didn't participate
 Marchete: or just say "I don't f*cking about the contest, don't even try to ask me again"
 Marchete: it's more subtle
 NinjaDoggy: lmao
 reCurse: No, because I don't like lying
 Marchete: care*
 Illedan: I should do the same to not burn out the first weekend on nonesense
 Marchete: ahh
 King_Coda: This chat makes me tired
 reCurse: So if I participate and say I don't, then it's a lie
 miszu: so say maybe
 King_Coda: I'm going back to making webpages. Hopefully no 14 year olds will bother me there
 ashiknur: see what just happend<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553577436">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553577436</a>
 Astrobytes: That's the implication miszu
 miszu: maybe I will make legend
 Westicles: I love people who won't/can't lie. Usually very easy to read in real life
 Westicles: They make that squished up face when they don't know what to say
 reCurse: If you assume I never lie you're as easy to read then
 miszu: Westicles I think it's more about integrity
 Counterbalance: everyone lies all the time
 JBM: just praise the loving
 Counterbalance:&#160;;)
 AllYourTrees: L Y I N G I S C O O L
 JBM: prove it
 Riphiphip: If someone says they never lie, they're probably lying
 miszu: try to get a job with intelligence services. They will ask you tough questions while on a lie detector machine.
 AllYourTrees: i have nothing to add to this conversation&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: So will Jeremy Kyle 
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert shock-daytime-TV-presenter-talk-show-host-here&gt;
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm going back to other stuff, this chat is wank. Sorry not sorry.
 AllYourTrees: bye!
 King_Coda: I'm going as well
 King_Coda: This chat makes me feel physically ill
 King_Coda: try to keep it together tomorrow, okay guys?
 AntiSquid: tell us about your experience miszu
 miszu: AntiSquid haha. You assumed I had interview with them?
 Westicles: The CIA used to recruit engineers heavily.  Pay was awful, though.
 miszu: yeah the pay for devs are not as good as private companies
 miszu: I'll tell you this, I got "lucky" enough that I got interviewed by their head of psychology department.
 Westicles: I interviewed, it was all about overseeing private companies making gadgets for them
 Marchete: :spy:
 AntiSquid: like reversed engineered saucers&#160;?
 AntiSquid: sorry. couldn't resist, ya awesome stories
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553588881">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553588881</a>
 Noyotens: can 
 Noyotens: someone
 Noyotens: tell
 Noyotens: me 
 Noyotens: where
 Noyotens: is
 Noyotens: the
 pmor: use your spacebar instead of enter.
 Noyotens: proplem in my code
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: where is the ban hammer?
 Automaton2000: well if i wanted to try something else
 AntiSquid: hey Noyotens put it all in one line, see what boss does and mimic it i guess
 HackingHues: dito do what the boss does. see that the boss doesn't place a seed in any of their current trees neighbors... yours does. likely need to add a little logic to make it a little better.
 Lucky30_: what is better: this: [[1,0,-1],[-1,-1,0]] or this: [{x:1,y:0,z:-1},{x:-1,y:-1,z:0}]
 Lucky30_: array of arrays for coords
 Lucky30_: or
 Lucky30_: array of objects
 Noyotens: array of array
 Lucky30_: why
 XeroOl: performance
 Lucky30_: great
 Lucky30_: thank you
 miszu: Lucky30_ arrays are stored next to each other in memory. Objects are stored in different places
 miszu: with high probability
 Astrobytes: Whenever I do a contest, if I'm in silver I always lose matches against jenthomas88!
 Lucky30_: that is cool, thank you for sharing miszu
 miszu: I don't think with my current submission I'll break the top 500
 VizGhar:  werent you already in top 200?
 miszu: no never, maybe in silver league
 miszu: but now I am with the big boys
 VizGhar: oh ok
 ClockSort: gold div is huge
 ClockSort: 900 people now
 miszu: 899
 VizGhar: too much
 ClockSort: 2100 silver. 2700 bronze. are these ratios typical?
 Astrobytes: Now that there are more participants I guess it goes with the territory
 AntiSquid: more participants that somehow always pick btter heuristics
 Astrobytes: better heuristics than...?
 AntiSquid: looking at my 200k node generator and wonder if i should drop it, code in python or something
 VizGhar: 200k nodes of what?
 Astrobytes: Sadness or Fail I presume.
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: epic fail from my part
 AntiSquid: very true
 KCrown: so once you submit new code ... how long doesit take to reflect in ur rankings approx?  after 100% battles?
 Marchete: I was using CG node index in some parts
 Marchete: == great havok
 Astrobytes: in your sim?!
 Marchete: yeah
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: :angry:
 Marchete: hours tracking it
 Astrobytes: Oh stop moaning and fix it :P
 Marchete: it's 1 line
 Astrobytes: hehehe, that's even better
 Astrobytes: don't worry though, I only got out of Bronze because I fixed my 'src&#160;!= dest' error for SEEDing
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, no. It was src and dest read incorrectly in input.
 Astrobytes: Slowww battles

 Marchete: **feelsgood**
 Marchete: I can do a full game sim at turn=0
 Marchete: and match in CG IDE
 Astrobytes: eyyy nice one
 Astrobytes: Now do that several times :P
 Marchete: Smits had the sim in 1 day...
 Astrobytes: Or did he...
 Marchete: I just needed 6
 Astrobytes: Did he give up or something btw? Smits that is.
 Lucky30_: god you are too far ahead
 Astrobytes: God is playing too?
 Lucky30_: hhhhh
 Lucky30_: god is everywhere
 Astrobytes: lol
 Marchete: mine it's a pretty basic bot
 Marchete: like get all moves
 Marchete: all possible moves
 Marchete: and do some scoring
 Marchete: to see what can be good
 Marchete: and setting some limits on each size
 Lucky30_: nice
 VizGhar: that "some scoring" is scarry
 Lucky30_: exactly
 Marchete: scoring for me is even without shadow
 Astrobytes: Marchete describing any low depth search that ever existed
 Lucky30_: you should make a tutorial
 Marchete: but you need more then neighbours
 Marchete: it's the most basic
 Astrobytes: oh sht, distance
 VizGhar: Idk when to complete trees
 Marchete: try to seed on areas with low neighbours
 Astrobytes: and neighbours
 Marchete: try to grow trees that block enemy trees and not yours
 Marchete: things like that
 Marchete: you must start thinking like a tree :D
 Lucky30_: start thinking like Marchete
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Marchete: that's a good way for heuristics
 Marchete: for sim?
 Marchete: nah
 Marchete: the same sh*t as always
 Marchete: tons of sim + a search + eval
 Lucky30_: any chance you would make a tutorial 
 ZarthaxX: hey Marchete guess what
 Marchete: no, you'll see real postmortems once it's done
 DomiKo: Marchete it's not like always
 Marchete: no?
 Lucky30_: great
 ZarthaxX: guess who had a bug in sim :D
 Marchete: sim+search+eval
 DomiKo: I would say that it's much harder
 Marchete: done
 DomiKo: no
 Marchete: ok
 Lucky30_: i cant wait for this contest to end...
 DomiKo: Last time you write something and it work. Now it do nothing. 
 marksalisbury: Wonder when/if I will be promoted out of Bronze?  I'm beating CatBoss (AI), ranked #2 in Bronze...
 DomiKo: It's really hard to get something.
 Astrobytes: That's the heuristic part
 Marchete: but that doesn't invalidate my point
 Marchete: tons of sims? check
 Marchete: some search algo? check
 DomiKo: nahhh
 Marchete: some good eval? check
 DomiKo: tons of pruning I would say
 DomiKo: Java is top1
 Astrobytes: based on some - 
 Lucky30_: what is next Marchete
 Marchete: Java is "fast"
 Marchete: java is simulating
 Astrobytes: It's run on all the devices
 AntiSquid: you don't need tons of sims to get higher rank than what you currently have Marchete
 Marchete: ofc a good pruning + ideas beat raw power
 DomiKo: there is a lot of tricky parts
 Marchete: I imagine
 Astrobytes: yeah, pruning heuristics + eval heuristics may not be overly similar
 Marchete: the idea remains the same
 Marchete: change all moves for pruning moves
 Marchete: but as TS is at top10 there must be some good way to compete without heavy sim
 Marchete: I'm 640th I'm just saying nonsenses anyways
 schachmatt: what's the maximum sun/score possible to get in a game?
 JBM: which map?
 schachmatt: map?
 AntiSquid: ya that's what i said, finding good heuristics march
 JBM: list of cells?
 schachmatt: any
 theycallmedavid: what is TS?
 Astrobytes: TypeScript
 VizGhar: tree search
 VizGhar:&#160;:) Team Speak
 Astrobytes: Ticklish Spot
 theycallmedavid: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: (TypeScript for clarity)
 alchemsti: Well, the nutrients go down
 alchemsti: But the richness bonus always counts
 alchemsti: so, there's not really an upper limit on score apart from running out of time
 alchemsti: but there are 210 nutrient points to be had
 alchemsti: which is what I'd like to factor into my bot next
 alchemsti: 'cuz currently I suck at choosing when to harvest
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553519906">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553519906</a>
 Marchete: top players almost play the same at first turns
 DomiKo: is super easy to calculate that
 AntiSquid: guess you can copy the behaviour if you have the hex coordinate system
 AntiSquid: like an opening book
 AlMualem:  do you think a shadow can determine the score? i mean..at some point a tree will be under a shadow..so the point is to have it at the bigger size possible in order to earn the sun points?
 KelvinAndHubbles: I mean, no matter whta size a tree it cant completely avoid shadows
 AlMualem: yes exactly
 AlMualem: so if you manage to have it at the bigger size possible you might be able to collet the sun points
 Marchete: make shadows to enemy, not yours
 AlMualem: yes...i must take under consideration that too
 Marchete: you can't avoid all, but in average you want to try to get more sun than the enemy
 Marchete: and that your costs are low too
 Marchete: having 5 seeds at a time costs a lot of sun
 Marchete: to produce them
 AlMualem: the next think i want to try as a strategy is to grow all my trees together...eg..i create 8 seeds and then i get them all 8 at level 1 the i start level 2 etc. what do you think?
 WolfDarrigan: Sounds expensive
 WolfDarrigan: Would be cheaper to have 1 at size 0, 1 at size 1, one at size 2 and then grow all of them so you don't pay extra
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, stagger the growth since it costs more to grow into a type you have a lot of
 AlMualem: hm...you got a point yes...i like what wolf proposed
 icecream17: oh, i'm at a high ranking because gold opene
 alchemsti: I'm at a lot ranking because gold opened...
 alchemsti: ... but I'm in gold&#160;;)
 alchemsti: (but very low)
 Smelty: wow
 Smelty: im in 550 in silver, thus i am bad
 Nerchio: i wish the errors were more in your face
 Nerchio: when you do illegal action it doesnt flash in your face :D
 alchemsti: One weird trick to boost your ranking: hardcode waiting your first turn if you aren't already doing so
 miszu: not bad, just room for improvement
 alchemsti: (of course, better is have your eval deliver that result....)
 miszu: new tries now
 miszu: I hope I can break the top 500
 HackingHues: lol well you can grow a tree to plant past your immediate neighbor... just makes sense...

 elderlybeginner: guessing what to put into scoring evaluation and a factors is annoying. Is there a general advise how to do it? 
 KelvinAndHubbles: a lot of guess and check, and you can always play against your boss / already submitted IDE code to see if it's better
 elderlybeginner: not much programming in it, not much learing
 KelvinAndHubbles: I mean, the more guess and check you do, the easier it is in the future, but yeah, it's a bit of logic and luck
 Kukiss: cegprakash internet says that if you omit the 'f' or 'F' the variable will be treated as double&#160;;)At least in C#
 cegprakash: but it shouldn't matter much
 cegprakash: I added f and it takes from 730 rank to 450 and climbing..
 Astrobytes: ...
 cegprakash: I cleaned up hard coding code and moved to array and I had no idea what happened to the code as my rank dropped drastically
 cegprakash: I fix build errors by adding F
 reCurse: Try adding one more f
 cegprakash: and i'm climbing 300 ranks
 schachmatt: F
 cegprakash: I also added an important feature for trash talking.. my rabbit trash talks every turn
 Kukiss: I wish I used less integers so I could try this trick
 cegprakash: and may be that helped the ranking I don't know if it was the trash talk or the F
 reCurse: Definitely the f
 ClockSort: question: should I get the same outcome if I press "Replay in Same Conditions"?
 reCurse: No
 schachmatt: idk the trash talking idea has merit
 ClockSort: why not, I'm not using srand
 reCurse: Your opponent could, you could have less computing time, etc
 ClockSort: of course, I get different number of sims. thanks
 schachmatt: ClockSort not if you or your opponent is using any randomness or search with timeout
 elderlybeginner: is 'shadow' important factor in scoring actions?
 Nerchio: future shadow sure
 elderlybeginner: which action is  the most influenced by shadow?
 Astrobytes: Re-read the statement.
 Astrobytes: It's more to do with your sun gains
 Astrobytes: etc
 elderlybeginner: yes, I understand that. I just cannot find idea to put it in scoring actions
 reCurse: Make sure growing a tree doesn't cause shadow on your own? shrug
 Astrobytes: Consider turns, sun direction, opp WAIT perhaps
 Astrobytes: Idgaf anyway, gn all and cya tomorrow
 elderlybeginner: oh, that's simple, just give huge negative factor for seeding in the line of your trees. I am asking what to do with future shadow for complete and grow actions
 alchemsti: The value of everything has a strong time component. That's one of the tricky parts of the game
 alchemsti: 2 sun is much more important at day 0 than day 23
 alchemsti: (generally)
 elderlybeginner: yes, kind of future value of an income
 Noyotens: guys  i want to be in gold plz tell me how
 Nerchio: make trees sell trees
 elderlybeginner: it's one of the easiest contests to get into gold
 Noyotens: Nerchio ur genius
 Nerchio: you're welcome
 MoMaT: Noyotens, I give you a tactical hint. your best chance to get to gold was when the boss appeared.
 Noyotens: what
 AlMualem: (mind blown!!!!!)
 MoMaT: at that time, many people beat the boss and it doesn't have high true kill score.
 AntiSquid: hindsight haha
 AlMualem: so the boss get better as more players get better!
 MoMaT: now, when best players moved to gold, its harder to be better than the boss. because you also have to be pretty much better than all the other players as well.
 MoMaT: it's not better, but it's harder to pass.
 struct: the boss does not get better
 MoMaT: usually this is most prominent for the gold league boss, because it's hard to make ground breaking improvements there.
 elderlybeginner: can some cells on the grid to be consider better exclusively due to theirs positioons, eg. corner cell are better?
 MoMaT: but don't worry, you can still get out of silver, but you need to make large improvement, not just tweak a parameter here or there. then you might be placed in the middle of gold straight away.
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553603993">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553603993</a>
 Noyotens: i do this but i am not in gold
 MoMaT: it doesn't matter if you can win against the boss. you need to win more against all the other players than the boss does.
 elderlybeginner: you are seeding too much and incorrectly
 AntiSquid: best way to understand the leaderboard is to experience it yourself
 AntiSquid: when you're stuck in silver until under contest you will understand
 Mourfette: Noyotens you seed too much, and your trees are neighbors, half of your trees are in the shadow all the time. look at how to place your trees so theyu don't shadow each other, and don't see too much, it costs you a lot for little gain
 alchemsti: Ha, tried something new, and moved myself to dead last in my league. Oops
 Mourfette: seed*
 Noyotens: guys goodbye i am gonna leave spring challenge
 AlMualem:&#160;:(
 Noyotens: :cry:
 AlMualem: why mate?
 AlMualem: its 4 days yet
 Noyotens: this shit boot 'Bossoot'
 AlMualem: you play for yourself ,to get better, not to win (at least thats the point for me)
 AlMualem:&#160;:)
 Noyotens: u true but i cant do anything 
 Noyotens: i try evrything so
 therealbeef: try a new algorithm
 therealbeef: it's not unusual for people to completely change their approach in the second half
 Noyotens: i try all the algorithms in my head
 AlMualem: i was thinking how to get to silver for 2 whole days....and last night i thought something completely from what i had thought and by refactoring my code i got to silver in 1 hour :D 
 alchemsti: Wow, really?
 alchemsti: You already calculate shade exactly?
 alchemsti: You tried looking more than one move ahead?
 AlMualem: completely different*
 Noyotens: ok 
 alchemsti: You tried different ways to value sun vs pts depending on how many days are left?
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553409284">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553409284</a>
 Noyotens: iam gonna try this alghorithm
 Noyotens: i am in 67TH on silver
 AlMualem: can you exmplain me this algorithm?whats his strategy?
 AlMualem: explain*
 KelvinAndHubbles: seems like he plants between two enemy trees so that if he levels his own up to level 3 there no matter what he can stop production of both those trees on certain days
 AlMualem: hm...i must start taking under consideration what the opponent does
 AlMualem: its vital info
 KelvinAndHubbles: eh, I mean you can go pretty far without that, you just need to look at where their producing shadows and where their main product are to see how you can counteract that
 KelvinAndHubbles: of course, main source generator of a board can very easily change since you just complete a bunch of trees and build on the other side of the board
 AlMualem: true dat
 AlMualem: thanks mate
 AlMualem: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553716855">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553716855</a> 
 AlMualem: this is what i do at the moment...i know its not very optimal...but i try whenever i seed to seed closer to the center (because of the points gained) and try to reach 3 tree ready to complete and then start completing in order to gain (at to my thinking) more sun points
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553719178">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553719178</a>
 Noyotens: u stole my code
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, thats a good strategy, but look at their supporting tree vs yours. At about 30 frames and till the rest of the game they have 2 tier 2 trees and a tier 1 on the outskirts as opposed to your two. While that does mean every tier 1 they build for completion will cost an extra 1, it's made up for the by the fact that he gets an extra 1 every turn. 
 KelvinAndHubbles: even more on Noyotens game lmao, you see the supporting trees on the outring difference
 AlMualem: @Noyotens haahhahah :D great minds finally meet each other :P
 Noyotens: nice to meet u
 Noyotens: :crazy:
 Noyotens: KelvinAndHubbles
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea?
 Noyotens: @KelvinAndHubbles can u simplify
 KelvinAndHubbles: Basically, look at how he sets up trees outside on his area to always generate sun that don't have conflicting shadows that hurt each other
 KelvinAndHubbles: (for your replay that is)
 Noyotens: ooooh
 KelvinAndHubbles: the boss is just getting insane amoutns of free eco
 KelvinAndHubbles: or sun
 KelvinAndHubbles: or whatever its called
 Noyotens: ok
 Noyotens: thanks
 AlMualem: we could try seed at the outskirt in the start and then after a point (we need to find which is the optimal one) start seeding towards the center ...does this make sense?
 Noyotens: yes
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553729222">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553729222</a>
 Noyotens: @KelvinAndHubbles ur the best
 Noyotens: thank u soooooooo mush :grinning:
 AlMualem: floor is lava at the center?
 AlMualem: :P
 Noyotens: lol
 AlMualem: even you had the chance to seed in the center you didnt
 KelvinAndHubbles: lmao I mean I'm like 500 silver, so take my ideas with a grain of salt
 KelvinAndHubbles: well, I mean, I was, submitting a better version, but still not gonna be insane&#160;:/
 AlMualem: do you follow any specific strategy at growing the trees?
 Noyotens: im in 90
 Noyotens: yes
 Noyotens: seed to dump tree
 AlMualem: by dump you mean...
 Noyotens: big
 alchemsti: Man, I cant seem to improve my eval, nor can I get smarter about choosing when to harvest.&#160;:/ guess it's time to try Beam Search and hope brute forcing can help
 cegprakash: or add trash talking feature like mine
 cegprakash: it helps
 Noyotens: chose the more rishness trees first 
 cegprakash: Noyotens he is in gold league
 Nerchio: alchemsti spoiler: it doesnt really
 Noyotens: no iam in silver:cry: 
 cegprakash: I meant alchemsti is in gold
 alchemsti: ha Nerchio, have you tried using MORE brute force?
 alchemsti: I think that's the general solution to brute force not working.
 Nerchio: depth is only useful so much when you dont predict your opponent
 alchemsti: I am barely in gold
 alchemsti: I think it's also useful at the end with harvesting
 alchemsti: and I have a plan for predicting my opponent
 alchemsti: But it means a pretty big change to entire code
 alchemsti: So depressing seeing that first row of "#2" come down&#160;:&lt;
 FerrusDude: word&#160;:/
 Whiskee: went from 700 to 200ish gold because I realized after hours that a plus should have been a minus
 Whiskee: I'll just--
 Whiskee: sigh
 FerrusDude: but you found it before end of contest
 FerrusDude: :thumbsup:
 AlMualem: when magic meets depression = codind
 alchemsti: yeah, I would like to find that one weird trick :D 
 AlMualem: coding*
 alchemsti: That's a huge jump
 Whiskee: I feel like very subtle changes (yeah a wrong operator isn't subtle) make a huge difference compared to the last contest though
 FerrusDude: I agree
 FerrusDude: Per usual, I got to silver before I really ironed out my strategy.
 alchemsti: Yes. I find most of my boards start out the same
 FerrusDude: :think:
 Whiskee: debugging the potions in fall 2020 was just a nightmare, it was too difficult at every stage to "see" how close you were to completion
 miszu: 351st in gold. Making some nice progress
 Whiskee: as a human watching a replay I mean
 iggy12345: is anybody else using minimax with pruning and have some tips as to what to use for alpha and beta?
 iggy12345: for the contesty
 Nerchio: i just saw people say its more difficult to use minmax in simultaneous games
 Nerchio: but dont know much about it&#160;:
 iggy12345: does the number of players increase from 2?
 Nerchio: no
 iggy12345: what do you mean by simultaneous?
 Nerchio: you make moves at the same time
 iggy12345: ohh, it can be, but with a good simulation system it's not too bad
 iggy12345: tho I guess I haven't gotten mine working yet, I just got my actual system working
 iggy12345: the biggest issue I had was recursion depth and the fact that the first few turns don't actually yield any points
 Nerchio: yeah true well states need to be judged by something more than points for sure
 Noyotens: i have the best trick
 iggy12345: oh?
 erich0123: haskell is awesome
 Grillaume: is it good 115 gold without simulating&#160;?
 KelvinAndHubbles: do you think it's good?
 miszu: I am 350 without sims
 Zenoscave: Just basic scoring?
 Zenoscave: what do you guys use for scoring components?
 Grillaume: I'm wondering what the top 100 is doing basically
 miszu: most of them sims
 miszu: some do like us
 Zenoscave: I think most are sim
 JerryRat: you're bad apple
 Grillaume: well thx
 Wontonimo: Grillaume, being 115 gold with just if/else is great.  Be proud
 iggy12345: I was thinking about tyrying to map the entire gamespace for the contest, but with only 4 days left, I'm not sure it's worth it
 Zenoscave: That's probably not an easy task as you think
 iggy12345: it's just minimax, but with the maximum recursion depth
 Zenoscave: a rough estimate would be 10^100
 iggy12345: psh
 Zenoscave: posible states for one starting position
 Zenoscave: on one game board
 iggy12345: oof, I forgot about the randomized start and the tiles
 iggy12345: hmm
 Zenoscave: yeah... plus that only is if there are 10 possibles moves on each of 100 turns
 Zenoscave: I've seen move lists up to 80
 Zenoscave: and 140 length gmaes
 Lucky30_: how many possible diagonal set are there.. 3&#160;?..
 iggy12345: well, you could just use the base map and then use a search tree based on the current map
 PatrickMcGinnisII: golds open eh
 Zenoscave: so a reasonable upper max would be. 80^140 * 18c4
 iggy12345: psh, I could do it
 Zenoscave: 80^140 * 18c4 * (16c3 + 16c12 + 16)
 Zenoscave: that's my best upper bound
 iggy12345: I'm working on a project like that for reversi right now
 Noyotens:  	
 struct: are you playing othello here?
 Noyotens: tt
 iggy12345: you just gotta do BFS and flush things out of memory when you're done with them
 iggy12345: yeah, well, I'm not playing it right now, right now I'm coding
 iggy12345: but I have a project similar to what I'm talking about
 iggy12345: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/iggy12345/reversi_walker">https://github.com/iggy12345/reversi_walker</a>
 struct: yeah but there is othello on cg
 Zenoscave: 1.537792e+272
 Zenoscave: that's about how many states I suspect max
 struct: I saw that number before :thinking:
 Zenoscave: 140 turns branch factor of 80 max and ~.56M starting positions
 Zenoscave: of course symetry of starting positions is not accounted
 Lucky30_: can anyone help? how many possible diagonal sets are there.. 3&#160;?
 iggy12345: I mean you could do something like deep blue where you do a combination of minimax with pruning and static analysis
 iggy12345: lucky, what do you mean by diagonal sets?
 iggy12345: the symmetry for this would be 1/6
 Zenoscave: yeah iggy12345 without massive prunning that would take 9.512938e+254 years
 Zenoscave: and isn't heat death of the universe around1e10 years 
 Zenoscave: that time is if you could solve a state in a single cpu cycle btw
 Lucky30_: iggy12345 cells where you could put your trees without them shadowing eachother..
 iggy12345: oh, I'm actually using that right now
 Zenoscave: Lucky30_ 3
 Zenoscave: yes
 iggy12345: 28, 25, 22, 19, 34, 31, 16, 12, 8, 10, 18, 14, 0
 iggy12345: those are the indexes of diagonal cells
 iggy12345: for trees up to size 2
 Greg_3141: Why do I need to wait 45 minutes to be promoted to Silver?
 Lucky30_: but what about cellIndex 6....
 iggy12345: greg, because you're too op and are being nerfed
 Lucky30_: and 17
 iggy12345: 6 is shadowed by cell 0
 Zenoscave: Lucky30_ that's one of the 3 sets
 iggy12345: 17 is also shadowed by cell 0
 Lucky30_: ow sorry i did not see your first comment.. thanks Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: yup
 Lucky30_: iggy12345 17 belongs to another set.. and 6 belongs to a thired set
 Greg_3141: At what league do people stop using anything other than C/++ and Rust?
 Zenoscave: no league
 iggy12345: greg, the top participants are almost all C++ right now
 Zenoscave: there's a typescript in top 20
 Greg_3141: surprising
 Zenoscave: 26 /27 are python and perl
 iggy12345: yeee
 SnappleLevi: my main account is third in south america acutally
 Lucky30_: javascript is nowhere to be found
 iggy12345: as it should be
 Lucky30_: nooo
 Lucky30_: js for life
 iggy12345: *vomits*
 Lucky30_: noooo
 iggy12345: python for life
 iggy12345: C for life
 Zenoscave: tools for the jobs they're good at for life.
 Lucky30_: js for life
 Lucky30_: hhhhhh
 Lucky30_: Zenoscave you win
 FerrusDude: hehehe Zenocave
 Lucky30_: iggy12345 you lose
 Lucky30_: :p
 FerrusDude: Rust is fun.
 Greg_3141: yeah it'
 iggy12345: Lucky30_ you lose too
 FerrusDude: I JS all day.
 Greg_3141: it's pretty nice
 iggy12345: :p
 Lucky30_: js in super fun
 Lucky30_: iggy12345 nooo
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave pewpew
 Zenoscave: pewpew Zarthie
 struct: ValGrowth won coder one and is already top 20 here o.o
 Zenoscave: He's a formidibble player for sure
 Lucky30_: no worries, in 10 or 20 years, i will kick his a**

 Noyotens: what
 ZarthaxX: how*
 Noyotens: easy :sunglasses:

 ZarthaxX: howdy zeno
 Lucky30_: *15 or 25 years

 Zenoscave: hiya zarthie
 Zenoscave: Already said pewpew
 ZarthaxX: i said howdy
 ZarthaxX: not hi
 Zenoscave: what's the difference
 ZarthaxX: how are you doing
 Zenoscave: :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: in my world :P
 Smelty: reeeeeee i can't think of anything to improve my bot
 ZarthaxX: i will go to eat now anyway, will come back laterhaha
 Zenoscave: I'm doing good. Just trying to optim a bit before tomorrow for eval improvement
 AllYourTrees: have you tried translating to python yet?
 ZarthaxX: im trying eval here
 ZarthaxX: struggling
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 AllYourTrees: its the fastest language
 Zenoscave: As a wrapper perhaps
 iggy12345: Smelty have you thought about mapping the game space and training a neural net?
 iggy12345: then it would be a real bot
 AllYourTrees: oooh good one
 Smelty: well for that i would rewrite my whole code
 Smelty: hmm
 AllYourTrees: have you tried big data yet?
 Zenoscave: Nice joke iggy12345
 iggy12345: I try
 Smelty: o.o
 struct: I only need to work on eval aswell
 struct: my sim is fast enough I think
 Zenoscave: knowning you, probably&#160;;)
 iggy12345: alright, I'm gonna head to bed
 iggy12345: goodnight guys

 Zandy156: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553765459">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553765459</a>
 Zandy156: What do you think went wrong here Struct? 
 AlMualem: Noyotens i am still struggling with silver....right now i seed after make my 2 first trees level 2...then i seed three times towards the center (the rest of the seeds are at the outskirts) and whenever i reach 3 leve 3 trees i start completing them until i get to 1 an so it goes on....any thoughts?
 Zenoscave: AlMualem too hardcoded. It'll be better to see which moves make sense at the time
 Noyotens: i am still in silver too
 struct: Zandy156 what do you mean?
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553769123">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553769123</a>
 AlMualem: Zenoscave,and the factor for the "best" move would be...the sun direction,sun points consumption,opponent's indexes...what am i missing?
 Smelty: hmm
 Smelty: Noyotens oof
 miszu: struct how's your bot going?
 miszu: I am catching you&#160;;)
 struct: Just wait until I make the eval&#160;;)
 Smelty: o.O
 Noyotens: where is typescript guys                                 
 struct: should be in the list
 Smelty: hmmm yes
 struct: but good job so far miszu
 ClockSort: woooot I just had a breakthrough
 struct: which algo are you using?
 Smelty: congrats clock
 miszu: struct the mighty if/else
 Smelty: yes.
 Smelty: i am using scoring + if/else
 Smelty: no sim though
 struct: :grimacing:
 miszu: having the good eval function + magic threshold values + changing eval depending on which day # will be the key
 Smelty: my ai is a noob&#160;:(
 LLG: it seems there are a lot of if/else bots in high gold
 Smelty: hm.
 LLG: meanwhile my beam search is still stuck in mid silver because my eval is garbage
 Step_Bro: Anybody else had the issue of their input function reading their output?
 Smelty: and my scoring if/else is stuck in 5--
 Smelty: *500
 Glucozen: LLG hey&#160;! i'm not alone lol
 miszu: Smelty figure out what wrong moves you are doing
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: trying to
 Smelty: also i have 0 problems with running out of time; my current scoring system uses ~1 millisecond
 Glucozen: someone have tips for making good evla&#160;? i'm beginner :p 
 Smelty: first if/else then eval
 Glucozen: first if/else&#160;? 
 Smelty: so my eval is kinda
 ClockSort: i've been working on monte carlo, first I have ever built... it took all weekend just to make it work -- silver opened and it was stuck in bronze! but now and a small change in the rollout just boosted it from ~800th gold to ~300th gold.   Feels great to see MC in action&#160;:)
 Smelty: first decide which action is best, then score each type of that action then find the best one
 Smelty: it saves time
 XeroOl: MCTS or just plain MC? @ClockSort
 XeroOl: that's really cool
 Smelty: owo
 Smelty: hey xero you got to gold?
 XeroOl: Nope lol
 XeroOl: still in silver
 Smelty: same xD
 Smelty: i am in top 20%
 XeroOl: I've switched to a sim though
 Smelty: but cant seem to get up
 ClockSort: @XeroOl just plain MC, i take the root node and do MC on both player's actions, applying them together, then rollout and just update for those initial moves.
 XeroOl: have'nt submitted a sim
 ClockSort: no tree.
 XeroOl: but I have 90% of a simulation working
 Smelty: so mc not mcts
 XeroOl: that's really cool @clockSort
 XeroOl: they said MC in their posts, I was the one who asked
 ClockSort: yeah it's just MC. and it's now 217th Gold. crazy
 Smelty: new sub which delays selling trees seems to be boosting me
 Smelty: still battling but in 373 as opposed to the old sub, 500
 XeroOl: @Smelty I'm literally at the middle of silver right now
 XeroOl: 1025
 Smelty: F
 Smelty: i used to be around there before gold opened
 fvla: i'm still stuck making my move generator D:
 Smelty: :pain:
 fvla: please help
 Smelty: :bow:
 XeroOl: my Algorithm is REAL bad though
 fvla: i'm drowning in bitboards and templates
 Smelty: sorry, i dont use bitboards-
 fvla: specifically, *variadic* templates
 Smelty: wow just increased another 100 ranks
 XeroOl: is there a good place to paste some code and share it?
 Smelty: if i add something else on top of this, i might have achance-
 Smelty: xerool use this:
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/">https://pastebin.com/</a>
 Smelty: or u can use the codingame auto-pastebin
 Smelty: i prefer the pastsebin.com though
 Smelty: it has syntax highlighting as well
 XeroOl: I thought I saw like a gist.codingame url or something somewhere at some point
 XeroOl: syntax highlighting won't help lol
 Smelty: lol.
 Smelty: i mean itll make it easier for the person you sharing it with
 XeroOl: there's no language to highlight in
 XeroOl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/NLgZcbjg">https://pastebin.com/NLgZcbjg</a>
 Smelty:&#160;?
 XeroOl: here's my heuristic right now
 XeroOl: it's hillarious
 Smelty: knai
 XeroOl: wait I need the definition of strat lol
 Smelty: *lmao
 Smelty: so if have much sun then plant middle
 Smelty: great logic ya got there
 XeroOl: it's like stupid hardcoded
 Smelty: lmao
 XeroOl: you can see how syntax highlighting wouldn't help
 Smelty:  i personally just toggle around with stuff and see what it does
 Smelty: if it helps a lot, then  i keep it lol
 XeroOl: it's a couple string processing substitutions away from being valid code
 XeroOl: and then I just eval it
 XeroOl: anyway, you can tell the logic is bad, so I don't deserve higher than  1/2 of silver
 XeroOl: I'm working on a sim right now, not on making this if-else bot any smarter
 ClockSort: @XeroOl good idea, you get 100ms, doing some kind of sim seems better than not
 ClockSort: top options seem like beam search, MC, and MCTS, based on discussions
 XeroOl: right now I'm thinking like a genetic algorithm sort of thing
 XeroOl: where I have a list of things to do on each day, and then see what slight mutations to it do
 fvla: What's the difference between MC and MCTS?
 XeroOl: MC is just monte carlo
 XeroOl: so playout based
 XeroOl: specifically, random playouts
 ClockSort: might think about how to use the if-else you have now to filter out bad options to narrow the search
 XeroOl: MCTS is combining MC with a tree search
 XeroOl: to start imagining what a competent adversary would do, and plan around their actions
 Smelty: w0w
 XeroOl: MCTS converges to an optimal solution if given infinite time
 Smelty: yes, but it is only given 50ms
 Smelty: small issue lol
 XeroOl: MC technically doesn't, but who really cares for 100ms
 XeroOl: yeah
 ClockSort: yes that's very interesting about MCTS, it converges to minimax
 XeroOl: MCTS is cool because it's theoretically correct
 Smelty: yes theoretically
 fvla: alphazero is really cool because it combines MCTS with neural network guessing
 XeroOl: when it's a short search space, like 1 day left, it can just solve for optimal play
 XeroOl: My understanding is that alphazero uses the neural network for playouts instead of random
 XeroOl: but maybe I'm very wrong
 fvla: it uses some randomness
 XeroOl: interesting
 fvla: it uses total randomness at the start
 XeroOl: it doesn't
 XeroOl: it doesn't re-learn every time it plays
 fvla: no, i mean at the start of training
 ClockSort: ok, my MC bot just finished its rankings, finishing out around #152 gold. I'm blown away that it actually works :laughing:
 fvla: sorry, wasn't clear
 XeroOl: yeah
 fvla: nice!
 XeroOl: MC sounds interesting though
 Glucozen: can i ask something&#160;? (beginner question ^^)
 fvla: absolutely not
 fvla: ...jk.
 fvla: Ask away!
 Glucozen: sh*t lol
 ClockSort: @Glucozen the answer is to use a while loop
 XeroOl: do you just do a bunch of random playouts and choose the first move of the best playout?
 fvla: we don't welcome any beginner questions here
 XeroOl: because that actually sounds like a super easy sim
 ClockSort: i guarantee it wasn't super-easy for me, lol
 XeroOl: lol
 XeroOl: maybe I'll copy you then lol
 XeroOl: well, the hard part would be the sim, not the heuristics / search algorithm
 XeroOl: you know what I mean?
 ClockSort: i basically randomly try moves and play them out, and the ones that play out well I try more often, and eventually i pick the one with the best random playouts.
 ClockSort: textbook MC
 XeroOl: That's really nice sounding
 XeroOl: I might just steal that lol
 XeroOl: then the question is just how fast your sim is compared to mine lol
 ClockSort: there's a lot of secret sauce around the playouts, because if it's perfectly random then it will favor seeding all over (there are way more seeds possible than other moves)
 XeroOl: whenever I eventually finish this
 XeroOl: ahh, fair enough
 XeroOl: in theory that secret sauce could involve heuristics and stuff too
 ClockSort: yep, there's a lot of room for creativity
 XeroOl: although the more you hardcode specific heuristics into the sauce, the less emergent behavior you get
 fvla: Glucozen, you typing that question?
 Glucozen: fvla sorry lol, i'm just wondering, how did you choose betweend MCTS and beamsearch&#160;? 
 XeroOl: do you simulate enemy moves at all?
 XeroOl: MCTS is tough because the players play simultaneously
 XeroOl: not that that really matters
 fvla: Glucozen I'm using beam search just because I don't trust random simulations to do the work for me
 ClockSort: i decided on MCTS because i knew it was good in theory and i'd never written one before... so it would be a good learning experience
 Smelty: h m m m  
 Smelty: interesting
 XeroOl: ClockSort do you simulate enemy moves at all?
 ClockSort: then i switched from MCTS to MC because the branching factor seemed way too high for the tree to be useful
 ClockSort: i was wrong, i think the tree can be useful, you just have to prune it a bit
 fvla: If I were to program MCTS, I'd want a neural network behind it
 Glucozen: so it's like we want&#160;? 
 XeroOl: what if you did MC, but each playout was a beam search
 XeroOl:&#160;!??!?
 ClockSort: @XeroOl it would be slower... it's a tradeoff
 ClockSort: the power of random bad moves is that you make a lot of them :D
 Smelty: wHaT
 Smelty: true
 XeroOl: ahh right, no heuristic is waaay cheaper
 fvla: beam search removes randomness though right?
 XeroOl: you could add some randomness back in
 fvla: not much i'd think
 XeroOl: nevermind then lol
 XeroOl: let me actually make a sim before I pretend I'm an expert on sims
 fvla: sounds like a good plan
 fvla: i have a tested beam search *finally* after two days of work
 fvla: it works
 ClockSort: I suggest beam search over MC. it took me days to get MC to be useful. I think it's a lot harder to do well with it
 fvla: but i have no move generator&#160;:(
 Glucozen: ClockSort why&#160;? never did MC
 XeroOl: I was going to do beam search anyway, because it's a new algorithm to me
 XeroOl: I did MC for some other challenge
 XeroOl: and MCTS for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
 ClockSort: because the "random" part of the playout makes stupid errors like completing your trees at the start of the game and covering the map with seeds. so it's horrible without the right guidance
 Glucozen: :o oki
 ClockSort: maybe i'm missing something
 XeroOl: and that guidance has to be stupid fast compared to a heuristic, which can be a bit slower
 ClockSort: it is supposed to work with randomness, but true randomness wasn't getting the job done for me.
 ClockSort: i mean, you can have like 35 ways to seed. so your playouts will be just a wall of seeds. probably not grandmaster level :D
 XeroOl: you could randomize the probabilities of each action&#160;:)
 ClockSort: @XeroOl that's a good start.
 XeroOl: like, make it choose a seed rate for early / middle / endgame
 XeroOl: still sounds like a lot of effort compared to beam
 XeroOl: beam needs a strong heuristic too though
 XeroOl: from what I can tell
 ClockSort: yeah
 ClockSort: maybe DFS is the answer. explore the entire game state during the first 1000ms.
 pmor: seeds cause the gamestate to explode in count
 pmor: i'm running into that problem now&#160;:(
 Smelty: oof
 jrke: exactly 1000 in gold
 pmor: I can sim about 10 days into the future at the start. Once about 15 trees are in play and i can only sim 1 or 2 days
 XeroOl: I wonder if getting a heuristic bot into gold would be a good goal, just to have good heuristics for simming lol
 Smelty: Lol
 ClockSort: my next step is finish my local simulator so I can locally play modifications of my bot against itself
 ClockSort: i calculate it takes 20 minutes to run 100 battles between two versions of bots on my local machine, which should be enough to see which one is better.
 XeroOl: and then machine learn an optimal heuristic
 Wontonimo: XeroOl I think that would be good.  but I'm biased 
 Zandy156: wow. telling my bot the game ends 3 turns sooner makes it so much better.
 XeroOl: lmao zandy
 ClockSort: @Zandy156 try telling it that the game ends after 7 days
 Zandy156: ok
 ClockSort: it will be rank 1
 Zandy156: it seemed to do worse if I go under 20 days but honestly way better than it should
 ClockSort: wow, it takes 12 seconds to play my bot against itself locally. That's pretty slow. Thanks, 100ms limits.&#160;:(
 XeroOl: do you know how many sims you can get to on codingame?
 XeroOl: it's possible your local computer is faster than codingame's
 XeroOl: and the 100ms limits would be different times on your local machine
 ClockSort: it seems similar, no pun intended
 XeroOl: nice pun
 Smelty: lol
 Cjx_1: when you get 404'd &lt;/3
 Zandy156: 407'd for me
 NinjaDoggy: hey ClockSort we're neighbors :D
 Smelty: o.O
 NinjaDoggy: (on the leader board ._.)
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: *im looking at you*
 Smelty: -e-
 CharmyRosewolf: I made it to silver league! I think it was the "henlo!" at the end of each action :thinking: And now I sleep. :sleeping:
 FerrusDude: :clap:
 ClockSort: not for long, ninjadoggy. not for long.
 ClockSort: you using a beam search?
 XeroOl: rust is not fun to work with
 ClockSort: i'm playing my bot against you right now, ninjadoggy.
 ClockSort: i lost, 114 to 141. Maybe I need to sort the digits of the scores on day 23.
 NinjaDoggy: i'm doing mcts
 NinjaDoggy: starting to optimize constants for eval&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: still using 6 random numbers I pulled out of my ass for now lol
 ClockSort: i like your output
 FerrusDude: rust is ... an acquired taste
 FerrusDude: lol
 ClockSort: you can see my MC score too
 Marchete: MCTS as simulating each even depth?
 XeroOl: My code is full of self.'s that would be unnecessary in c++ or java
 NinjaDoggy: MCTS without roll out
 eulerscheZahl: good morning. I'll give this chat another try
 NinjaDoggy: just eval at some depth
 NinjaDoggy: morning toad :D
 XeroOl: that's not MCTS then?
 Marchete: hi eulerscheZahl
 XeroOl: that's just TS
 ClockSort: h, @eulerscheZahl, gl hf
 FerrusDude: rust expects you to consume / destroy / recreate
 Kellthazar: Rust is cool
 NinjaDoggy: ok true it's technically
 NinjaDoggy: UCT tree search&#160;:)
 ClockSort: lol ninja we both think we're losing in the middlegame
 FerrusDude: I really only dislike the Box stuff.
 FerrusDude: that's a real migraine
 NinjaDoggy: lol pessimistic bots&#160;:(
 Marchete: each node in your tree is a move or all moves in a day?
 NinjaDoggy: each node is a state
 NinjaDoggy: moves are per move
 Marchete: ok
 NinjaDoggy: so some iterations it goes very deep
 KCrown: what are some good heuristics to get into legend?
 NinjaDoggy: other times it's very shallow XD
 Marchete: any kind of hashing?
 NinjaDoggy: yea when the game state is identical that's hashed to point to the same node
 NinjaDoggy: barely lost any iterations adding hashing with murmur2
 NinjaDoggy: and homebrew hashmap
 ClockSort: @kcrown so far I've come up with "don't make bad moves"
 NinjaDoggy: that's a pretty good one
 Zandy156: NinjaDoggy I replayed a game against you 3 times and it jumped back and forth between me losing by 40 and me losing by 10.
 NinjaDoggy: my heuristic is "get more points than the opponent"
 ClockSort: points, that's interesting.
 XeroOl: FerrusDude 50% of my code is "as usize"
 ClockSort: I was going for most seeds.
 Kellthazar: Yesterday, I was watching a stream that one viewer tell us about his bitboarding representation of the state... My brain has melted...
 FerrusDude: hahahaha
 FerrusDude: ... yea
 NinjaDoggy: Zandy156 yea my bot is pretty inconsistent right now&#160;:/
 FerrusDude: I tend to keep indexes as usize
 XeroOl: makes me want to just not store this in a memory efficient waty
 FerrusDude: not mem efficient, but so much easier
 XeroOl: usize for 0..37 feels so dumb
 FerrusDude: it's the indexing method
 XeroOl: I wonder if I can just add a trait at the top to make the problem go away
 FerrusDude: I don't pretend to fully understand the compiler team, but it has something to do with matching the mem location
 KCrown: Ive ran out if ideas. The last set of changes I made dropped me a few ranks ... 
 XeroOl: like impl U8Index for Vec&lt;T&gt;
 XeroOl: and make a trait
 FerrusDude: :thinking:
 XeroOl: or I guess operator overloading already has a trait?
 XeroOl: I dunno how rust works
 NinjaDoggy: ok new update to my bot, now it no longer cares how much it wins by :D
 NinjaDoggy: hopefully this is actually an improvement XD
 Zandy156: how did it care before?
 NinjaDoggy: at some ending state i used to have the reward be difference in scores
 KCrown: he was being nice ... 
 NinjaDoggy: now it's just 1(win), -1(loss), 0(draw)
 FerrusDude: @XeroOl I'd have to see what you were doing, but if the 37 is a constant ... you could `const LIMITER: usize = 37;`
 XeroOl: that's not what I mean
 FerrusDude: didn
 XeroOl: I have indices that refer to a specific tile
 FerrusDude: *didn't think so
 FerrusDude: right
 XeroOl: and the tile's max is 36
 FerrusDude: right
 XeroOl: so I'd prefer to save that index in a u8
 XeroOl: to save memory
 FerrusDude: yup.
 XeroOl: maybe I should just make a getIndex method that has the as usize inside of it
 Greg_3141: how much memory are you going to save?
 FerrusDude: rust wants a cast to usize. heh
 KCrown: you may save memory but you are using more computer time
 FerrusDude: not much really
 XeroOl: as usize costs nothing cpu time
 NinjaDoggy: unless you do a bunch of copying saving memory doesn't do much&#160;:/
 FerrusDude: the usize is a cpu based int that matches the memory sizing
 FerrusDude: so 64 on a 64, 32 on a 32
 XeroOl: using 8 bytes for something that should fit in a byte is a waste
 XeroOl: if my data is 8x bigger, my beam might not fit into the cache
 FerrusDude: which is why I personally save index values as usize, and u8 for actual numbers
 XeroOl: it could hurt performance a lot
 FerrusDude: ah
 Greg_3141: 8x bigger than what?
 KCrown: XeroOl 08:49PMusing 8 bytes for something that should fit in a byte is a waste of memory but to use U8 in a 64 bit machines makes ur code slower 
 XeroOl: @Kcrown not for load and store
 XeroOl: if i'm doing actual math on them with well defined overflow, then yes
 KCrown: even load and stores are 64 bits ... 
 XeroOl: x86 has byte addressability
 XeroOl: you cannot tell me otherwise lol
 KCrown: think about the math you need todo on 64 registers that's dealing with 8 bit data ... 
 XeroOl: there's no math though?
 Marchete: pfff only 70k sims
 XeroOl: it's converted to usize before any math is happening
 pmor: The savings/speedup is when you pack up to 8b vars into a 64b var.
 KCrown: depedns on things like data packing and alignment
 pmor: 8 8b vars*
 KCrown: tehre's no question that you save on memory the question is what is ur trade off I nterms of speed
 XeroOl: there's no trade off to be made here
 XeroOl: zero extending a byte is free in assembly
 XeroOl: it happens when you load it
 pmor: If its in your state, which you end up copying a ton of times, the savings can be significant
 XeroOl: the compiler is smart about this
 FerrusDude: it really is
 pmor: if its something you build once on initialization, then you won't see a benefit
 XeroOl: there's not really a reason not to
 XeroOl: except for the fact that rust makes it annoying to type every time
 FerrusDude: @XeroOl have you thought of using an iterator with enumerator?
 XeroOl: No I haven't
 XeroOl: I'm not really a rust person
 KCrown: thats why someone suggested the use of usize and not U8 
 Marchete: euler how many sims did you get?
 XeroOl: this is the largest rust project I've ever done
 FerrusDude: (Vec&lt;_&gt;).iter().enumerate()
 XeroOl: and it's only a couple hundred lines
 FerrusDude: the iterator is zero cost
 FerrusDude: compiles out
 XeroOl: I use that when I need to
 XeroOl: I'm not quite sure what you mean though
 XeroOl: iterating isn't the only thing I'm doing on tiles
 XeroOl: but when I do iterate over them, I'm using iter / enumerate when necessary
 XeroOl: I really wish we had support for more exotic languages on codingame
 XeroOl: so I could try more languages that aren't c++/rust
 tomatoes: D
 XeroOl: yeah, I guess I should do D for the next comp

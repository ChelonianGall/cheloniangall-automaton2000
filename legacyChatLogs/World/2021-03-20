 EliTheCoder: who else plays this enough to know who the bots are
 TDOdyssey: I am a bot
 jacek: happy Caturday
 jacek: Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! Let's finish our holiday cheer. 
 jacek: Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 'Cause tomorrow spring is here!
 DaNinja: \O/
 Veljko: Hey, I'm really new to coding c, r there games that are a bit easier for new folks?
 jacek: try some puzzles
 DaNinja: Power of Thor, Mars Lander and Coders Strike Back are fairly easy
 Veljko: ty, i'll check them out!
 Ahmanny: solution to thor
 BlaiseEbuth: no to Ahmanny
 InCog: Hi, in js if I want to find out if a float value is inbetween consecutive even and off numbers how would I go about it
 InCog: like 2.5 is in between 2 and 3 so it would return 3
 InCog: true
 InCog: not three
 InCog: but like 1.5 is between 1 and 2 and since the lower range is odd not even it returns false
 InCog: actually nvm I think I figured out the solution
 Leonardo_Silva: Hello people, I'm new here and without any experience on programming whatsoever. Currently attending a CCNA course and moving to Python afterwards. 
 Wontonimo: welcome to coding
 Leonardo_Silva: Thanks!
 Wontonimo: if you haven't coded before, you may find this site challenging.  Don't go away, but set your expectations accordingly
 Leonardo_Silva: I plan on start coding as I learn with the new course I will attend. Thank you for the advice&#160;!
 AntiSquid: what do you want to achieve&#160;?
 Leonardo_Silva: CCNA 200-301 cert &gt; Python PCAP cert &gt; DevNet Cert than get deeper knowledge in C/C++ and Java.
 AntiSquid: i mean what do you want to achieve with that knowledge
 Wontonimo: world domination, no less
 Leonardo_Silva: I don't honestly plan on achieving anything anytime soon but who knows, developping a game or automate something that will make my life easier.
 AntiSquid: you don't need java btw
 AntiSquid: you learn py and c++, fuck java, best life advice
 Leonardo_Silva: What about javascript?
 AntiSquid: are you doing web dev&#160;?
 Wontonimo: there are still plenty of java jobs out there that pay well
 AntiSquid: you can webdev in python too, depends if you are a JS hater or not
 Leonardo_Silva: Not at the moment. Not really interested in it unless I was trying to setup an ecommerce.
 AntiSquid: JS is amazing, but it's best for webdev
 AntiSquid: and you need to learn like 20+ frameworks / year
 Wontonimo: that's the part i hate
 Leonardo_Silva: I follow this guy called Joma Tech, he seems really high level programmer and he posted this video <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiKK04Ht8QI&amp;ab_channel=JomaTech">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiKK04Ht8QI&amp;ab_channel=JomaTech</a> . It really made me question if I was joining the right thing.
 Wontonimo: joining what thing?
 Leonardo_Silva: I've seen Django been used a lot.
 Leonardo_Silva: Joining the programming community.
 AntiSquid: he is alright, but be careful with youtube since obv they do it for views and will make videos that hype or jump on the hype train to gain views
 Leonardo_Silva: Well, that's the thing. He's not like that, he gives you the reality and the facts, which is why I like it.
 Wontonimo: ^^ what AntiSquid said
 AntiSquid: wonto could try to focus a bit more on hype trains for his videos
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: i don't do that
 Leonardo_Silva: You guys are pretty good yourselves from what I see on your profiles.
 Leonardo_Silva: I'm just a newb, looking at your profiles makes me sad that I still have so much to work to achieve in a way.
 jacek: we've all been there
 AntiSquid: ya that's bs, just focus on your skills lol 
 AntiSquid: theoretically you could build a shitty android app following a tutorial and slap some ads on it and make money, ezpz, no need to be great
 Leonardo_Silva: Yeah but I'm not very strong at math and I have a problem learning through text or images, I learn mostly from practice and experiencing different scenarios. I set these big goals for myself because I want to push myself and believe I can achieve it.
 AntiSquid: do codingame puzzles using python, python is easiest to learn
 Wontonimo: "i learn mostly from practice and experiencing" - you well go far in programming
 Leonardo_Silva: I wanted to, at some point, become a Python Dev with a PCAP cert, do you think it's possible?
 Leonardo_Silva: Also, key feature that I have is that I love to automate things.
 AntiSquid: do you know python&#160;?
 AntiSquid: at all&#160;?
 Leonardo_Silva: I haven't started my course yet.
 AntiSquid: and you need to wait for that&#160;? lol
 Leonardo_Silva: Currently finishing CCNA 200-301
 AntiSquid: you gain more out of the course if you are a bit ahead of the class
 Leonardo_Silva: I don't need to wait, I just don't know how or where to start.
 AntiSquid: then finish ccna or start doing puzzles here or even multiplayers and avoid clash of code 
 AntiSquid: sololearn.com do the python course then come here do the easy puzzles and multiplayer 
 TheAlps: Why avoiding&#160;?
 Leonardo_Silva: So I just do the exercises under the "Practice" tab?
 AntiSquid: sololearn is fast intro, you can do it in few hours
 AntiSquid: i just told you how to speedrun @_@
 AntiSquid: you said you don't know python yet LeonardoSilva1
 AntiSquid: sololearn &gt; pythonthen puzzles here yes
 Wontonimo: LeonardoSilva1 follow anti squids advice, it's solid.  Don't be surprised if after a year of programming regularly that math seems easier
 jacek: yeah, who needs math nowadays ~
 Leonardo_Silva: My goal is to take this course as soon as Im done with CCNA&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-developer-certification-course/">https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-developer-certification-course/</a> .
 Leonardo_Silva: If you say this is a good starter, maybe I will give it a try while Im still finishing CCNA to get ahead of time.
 AntiSquid: i watched numberphile for the bs cat vs mouse puzzle, almost solved it without it, but there was that one stupid validator that forces you to use the numberphile approach, really lame imo
 jacek: have you done onboarding puzzle? its easy and you can do python there
 Leonardo_Silva: Currently on it Jacek
 AntiSquid: fuck udemy, you don't need it, why pay for it lol? udacity has free versions and just doing the codesignal arcade for python teaches you more
 Leonardo_Silva: Wasn't aware of Udacity.
 Leonardo_Silva: I've heard people saying to not be a Data Scientist and some other roles and to always aim for full-stack dev, Why is that?
 Wontonimo: no
 AntiSquid: make a list of the people that told you to not be a data scientist and keep it safe, never listen to them again
 Leonardo_Silva: Why do people say that though? Is there a certain difficulty to the role?
 AntiSquid: why always aim for fullstack&#160;? :D
 AntiSquid: i gave you enough advice lol got to do my bot now, busy overengineering
 jacek: bottlers?
 Leonardo_Silva: Alright, thanks a lot&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: learn a thing.  learn it well.  then learn it a lot more and master it.  if  it has anything to do with automating work, or business to business transactions in any way, you'll find great employment
 AntiSquid: secret 
 AntiSquid: where and how do you factor in profit into that Wontonimo&#160;? :P
 Wontonimo: profit?  you mean the unpaid labour of the masses?  oh, so capitalist of you
 jacek: learn blockain, make new cryptocurrency, profit $$$
 AntiSquid: i guess the business to business transactions is the profit part
 Leonardo_Silva: :D sorry for giving you so much trouble, just a newb passing by trying to make sure Im not making the wrong choices and hearing from people who have experienced it.
 AntiSquid: we are talking to each other, finish your courses
 AntiSquid: how are you promoting your currency jacek? we're circling back to entrepreneurial side of things
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid - i'm a recovering serial entrepreneur.  Now my motto is "work for the man" 
 Wontonimo: cuz it do payith well
 AntiSquid: there's lots of crypto coins nobody heard of or even cares about
 Wontonimo: just need a really good buzz word train hitch onto for the next crypto
 Wontonimo: some dude tried to rope me into making "machine learning blockchain" 
 Wontonimo: just squishing buzz words together without really thinking it through
 Wontonimo: but that's exactly the kind of crap that sells with hypechain
 Wontonimo: I guess this is why I just couldn't cut it as an entrepreneur
 sonic1991: what about NFTs&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i hear ya sonic1991.  Track progress on a globally distributed nft.  But what does it get you other than buzz
 sonic1991: Im just new to this technology, whenever someone speaks about it. I wanna join into conversation. Do you mean there is no valuable possibilities in the industry of blockchain 
 AntiSquid: lots of hype, you can cash in something i guess since cuck dorsey cashed in on a tweet of his through NFT, just now checked ...
 Wontonimo: there are lots of valuable possibilities of blockchain!  Tracking diamonds is a fantastic example
 sonic1991: haha
 Ziatzoraf: hi
 AntiSquid: :thinking: going to add a stick man drawing or something to NFT 
 sonic1991: I wanted to add some nft on openspace
 sonic1991: but gas price is annoying 
 sonic1991: to add it I would have to spend 70$ and wanted to sell for 30$. lol
 sonic1991: If this is a price for every nft I try to upload I need to have faith that someone will buy it for 100$ at least lol
 AntiSquid: got to hype your product better
 sonic1991: how
 AntiSquid: can't you set minimum purchase price&#160;?
 sonic1991: I can 
 sonic1991: I just dont want to pay 70$ for listing an item
 ErrorRazor: What's an nft
 sonic1991: sorry, maybe I am wrong, maybe its initial value that need to be pay
 sonic1991: I didnt upload any so I dont know
 AntiSquid: use a search engine to find our ErrorRazor
 sonic1991: tokenized digital assets 
 Wontonimo: ErrorRazor <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token</a>
 sonic1991: its crazy for how much those pixels sells
 AntiSquid: you can sell text
 sonic1991: I cant understand the value of collectible that can  be screenshoted
 AntiSquid: and games
 Wontonimo: it's crazy how much people pay for a basket ball to go in a basket
 AntiSquid: sonic1991 basically bragging rights that you own the original
 AntiSquid: or part of it
 AntiSquid: like say a famous painting
 sonic1991: aha
 AntiSquid: you can have a very nice copy or even better version, but original values more
 sonic1991: I mean yeah if I own rights to something beautiful/exceptional then yes, but...
 sonic1991: crypto punks or something...
 AntiSquid: the little bits of info i learned just now after you brought it up, google -&gt; watch videos at triple speed :P
 sonic1991: I guess anything can be valuable, you just need to create market for it
 AntiSquid: jack dorsey sold a tweet of his, he is popular for his shitty platform many use so he cashed in on his tweet or at least his tweet he put on nft is few millions
 AntiSquid: you need hype
 AntiSquid: sonic1991 you can actually put something on NFT now and maybe it grows in value later, use that to advertise your next piece of work
 AntiSquid: so 70$ now on 30$ return can mean a lot more profit later
 sonic1991: you are right
 Wontonimo: this is a collectors item thing.  and lots of people talk about that 1 comic or shoe or painting they bought way long ago
 Wontonimo: and made money.  
 Wontonimo: but they don't often talk about the boxes of collectables they bought that are now worthless
 Wontonimo: beware of survivor bias.  if you are going to collect something only do itt if you are passionate about it anyway and are willing to put in the effort to watch the market forever
 AntiSquid: it can be a gamble, up to you if you take it and how much you gamble
 AntiSquid: use a bot to watch the market for you :P
 EmbeddedIs77: ah, my whole lobby is bots
 Wontonimo: stop playing CoC, and jump on Botters of the Galaxy
 kayou: les traductions sur Cg sont faites par une vielle version de google trad&#160;?&#160;: 
 kayou: "Sur CodinGame, un jeu multi-agent est un jeu où vous pouvez contrôler several personnages/unités séparément pour atteindre un objectif commun."
 moyindavid: hello
 AntiSquid: click #FR for french chat
 AntiSquid: kayou
 AntiSquid: and dunno, maybe lol
 kayou: Oh, sorry, I was thiking being in the frnch chat

 Mitul-P14: any c++ users?
 BlaiseEbuth: Who's asking&#160;?
 Mitul-P14: me
 Mitul-P14: thats who
 Mitul-P14: i wanted some help cuz i suck at these cocs. 
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 Mitul-P14: i learned some string manip functions in class but they dont seem to work
 sonic1991: any ruby dev&#160;?
 AntiSquid: do easy puzzles instead, one puzzle at a time, stop wasting time 
 Mitul-P14: where are the puzzles?
 AntiSquid: practice
 Mitul-P14: ohhh
 AntiSquid: or do some multiplayer
 Mitul-P14: thnx
 Mitul-P14: and multiplayer would be where lol
 AntiSquid: compete
 AntiSquid: and wish people stopped using "coc" and "sucking" in same sentence
 Mitul-P14: so by multiplayer u mean claash of code?
 Mitul-P14: lol yeah my bad
 AntiSquid: by multiplayer i mean anything apart from clash of code
 Mitul-P14: so bot programmuing and optimazation?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: even golf is better
 Mitul-P14: ok thnx
 AntiSquid: np
 ozzy120937: Whats wrong with coc?
 Mitul-P14: i think imma do practice then some of that later
 Mitul-P14: theres a time limit and after that i cant practice it
 Mitul-P14: otherwise i wouldnt be coming here to ask
 AntiSquid: that timelimit is one of the issues with coc
 AntiSquid: better take your time and focus on solving 1 problem at a time
 ozzy120937: True
 Mitul-P14: especially if youre new here and trying to learn
 Mitul-P14: i cant lie that time limit has made my under pressure problem solving better but i never finsih becuase of it
 AntiSquid: you learn more from other puzzles really
 AntiSquid: coc isn't best learning material
 UnnamedCodinGamer: is there a way to filter the original classic puzzles?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: look for those without avatars
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes it is a nice tip
 UnnamedCodinGamer: they are a good starting place
 Mickee: Hello!I'm stuck in the The Descent Strong mountain(s).Could somebody explain the logic? Every turn the max(mountain) should be 0 or what else?
 Mitul-P14: yooo!
 Mitul-P14: im stuck on that too!
 Mitul-P14: idk whats happening. it seems so simple but it just keeps failing
 Mickee: Should be halved or whar?
 Uljahn: for The descent: click the hints tab on the left in IDE
 AntiSquid: The GoalDestroy the mountains before your starship collides with one of them. For that, shoot the highest mountain on your path.
 Mickee: highest mountain should be the max(mountain) or what?
 Uljahn: the index of the highest mountain
 Mitul-P14: my code is literally what the psuedo code said but i still keep failing the test
 MadKnight: show us the code then
 Mitul-P14: how?
 AntiSquid: 100% its not like pseudo code
 Mitul-P14: its the same exact concept
 AntiSquid: paste in chat
 MadKnight: to what puzzle&#160;?
 Mickee: while max(hegyek)&gt;0:
 Mitul-P14: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dc111750-d309-48b1-b0d9-b1dfebe4de7a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dc111750-d309-48b1-b0d9-b1dfebe4de7a</a>
 Mitul-P14: i have diff var names but its the same otherwise as far as i can see
 Mitul-P14: its The Decsent @MadKnight
 Uljahn: mountIndex = 0; should be inside the while loop i guess
 MadKnight: 
 MadKnight: guess what prevH will be on turn 2
 Uljahn: also prevH
 Mitul-P14: the size of the previous 
 MadKnight: on the next turn, not mountain
 MadKnight: after 8 mountains and after print
 MadKnight: there will be 8 other mountains
 Mitul-P14: so i need to what flip the sign?
 AntiSquid: Mickee Mitul-P14 your pseudo code implementation should be inside the while loop
 Uljahn: to reinitialize
 MadKnight: u need to do the same for the next 8 mountains
 MadKnight: but u saved max mountain from the previous 8

 Mitul-P14: solution ^
 Mitul-P14: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f09b3876-f356-47ed-8626-12d8dd862f1b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f09b3876-f356-47ed-8626-12d8dd862f1b</a>
 Mitul-P14: me ^
 AntiSquid: ya, see the difference? lol
 AntiSquid: move it all inside the while loop
 Mitul-P14: it is?
 Mitul-P14: oh i see
 AntiSquid: saying it 3 times won't help will it?
 Mitul-P14: i just didnt realize that thats what you were saaying
 AntiSquid: fine
 Mitul-P14: i just noticed that that was oputside the loop but yeah that makes sense
 Mitul-P14: :sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: it's ok, this will help for the rest of the puzzles
 Adiamant: yo is negative dy up or down?
 Mitul-P14: on the thor one?
 Adiamant: yes
 Adiamant: and the batman one too
 Mitul-P14: they said that the bottom right is all pos
 Mitul-P14: so then you just worry about N S E and W really
 Adiamant: wow im dumb
 MadKnight: i think dy is down in all games except mars lander
 Adiamant: thanks a bunch
 Mitul-P14: lmao. i was really confused too cuz bot right should have been x pos and y neg but if they said it then just go with it lol
 Adiamant: i solved by trial and error which is never a good sign
 Mitul-P14: lmao
 Mitul-P14: im just trying to really think this through but the amount of ifs is gonna be absurd
 Adiamant: are you talking about the descent?
 Dan4Life: hi
 MasterCoderxD: hey
 MateiBalaur: do you know how to solve it?
 MateiBalaur: i need help
 Mitul-P14: solve what?
 MasterCoderxD: can someone tell me how this works?
 Mitul-P14: also adiamant no, we were talking about thor ep 1
 MasterCoderxD: w=90;t=10;=1+(w&lt;80)+t
 MasterCoderxD: in Python3
 MasterCoderxD: how does that code work?
 Adiamant: if w is not smaller than 80, w&lt;80 returns 0, if w is smaller than 80, it returns 1
 Adiamant: so false is 0, true is 1, because binary and boolean
 Adiamant: i am da hackerman

 Mitul-P14: solution ^
 InCog: Exclude the else if (Y == lightY) {
 InCog: I dont see why that is necessary
 DaNinja: you set x and y before you read the input
 Mitul-P14: it still doestn work
 Mitul-P14: i added that to see if it would fix
 Mitul-P14: when i intialized?
 Mitul-P14: ohhhhhhh
 AntiSquid: ya check your variable placements
 Mitul-P14: see when i write my own code from scratch, i dotn make mistakes liket that but here, i dont see stuff like that. its really good that im making these mistakes in practice cuz if i had made these in a job, the consquences would exist
 MasterCoderxD: @Adiamant  I got it bro, butthanks anyway
 MasterCoderxD: *but thanks
 ShishirTiwari: lol
 therealbeef: Mitul-P14 in a job you'd make unit tests that catch these bugs, and you'd have a debugger. competitive programming is a bit primitive sometimes
 AntiSquid: you'd have team that tests shit for you&#160;:/
 AbdelkaderAb: Helloo guys
 therealbeef: unit tests are normally made and maintained by devs. integration tests ften too
 HunterEhrenfeld: unit tests are the devil
 BlaiseEbuth: No. I have nothing to do with these things...
 orangesnowfox: There, beat my 2048 score within 24ish h, like I said I would
 AntiSquid: Sorry to burst your bubble, BlaiseEbuth there is no devil.
 AntiSquid: and there is no hell either, you just rot away when you die
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, you're right, of course.
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth go to create a new hell circle especialy for AntiSquid.</b></p><p><img src="/a/58491929211531" /> AntiSquid: oh that's easy, become a politician and pass a completely idiotic law
 HunterEhrenfeld: my life goal
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. I was thinking about hundred of "squid" bikers. 
 AntiSquid: make squid bikers a protected minority and give them tax money if they break a bone for their own mistakes? ya that would work
 BleedingTime: Then start an insurance agency that encourages them to break bones to pay for their surgeries
 MadKnight: u can't gain money from that, u can only encourage everyone to destroy the entire economics by breaking bones simultaneously
 Rasuke_: i m new, anyone knows why my achievs arent updating?
 AntiSquid: which ones exactly aren't updating for you&#160;?
 Wontonimo: which one?
 Rasuke_: C, i have done some problems getting 100% and it says i only have done 1, idk
 Wontonimo: which problems?  
 Wontonimo: Clash of Code doesn't count, nor do bot battles
 Rasuke_: oh, i have done clash only
 Wontonimo: that's it
 Wontonimo: try something other than CoC
 Rasuke_: ty

 Rasuke_: ill try, ty :D
 DD_5-9: how do i code python?
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 DD_5-9: can someone teexh me?
 AntiSquid: yes it's easy
 DD_5-9: how?
 Wontonimo: yeah, no problem.  I can set you up.  Try this link www.youtube.com
 AntiSquid: type python syntax
 DD_5-9: where
 AntiSquid: where is your choice
 DD_5-9: idk im in a clash of code
 DD_5-9: and idk what to do\
 AntiSquid: play onboarding then&#160;?
 DD_5-9: whats that lol
 AntiSquid: and never touch clash again
 DD_5-9: lolll
 AntiSquid: lol glad you asked, use search bar at the top
 DD_5-9: ok
 DD_5-9: the puzzle?
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 is it the puzzle&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i just saw a replay of my bot?
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 has babies
 Automaton2000: do you have something that works
 DD_5-9: bruh idk wha to do dis shih weir
 AntiSquid: just take this quiz instead then&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://babylonbee.com/news/what-gender-are-you-take-the-quiz">https://babylonbee.com/news/what-gender-are-you-take-the-quiz</a> 
 AntiSquid: i like the babylonbee :o
 DD_5-9: im female XD
 AntiSquid: quiz was just for you, you get no special privilege regardless of result
 AntiSquid: just do onboarding puzzle
 MadKnight: imagine being a female
 MadKnight: cringe
 AntiSquid: why?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000, cool kids become some fancy attack helicopter entity
 Automaton2000: that means you have a different value
 AntiSquid: she just said female, not one of the 5million extra genders 
 MadKnight: i don't believe people on the internet when they say they're a female
 AntiSquid: why what does it change for you&#160;?
 MadKnight: i just don't believe, what else is it supposed to do&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ah you think they all roleplaying&#160;?
 MadKnight: such things happen
 Wontonimo: isn't it enough for you for someone to identify as female?
 Wontonimo: or attack helicopter
 MadKnight: it's about lying/not lying
 MadKnight: or about their reasons
 AntiSquid: didn't matter in that context
 orangesnowfox: Lying? What's the point of lying on the internet about your gender?
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: it was a joke quiz anyway 
 AntiSquid: orangesnowfox depends, here it doesn't matter
 orangesnowfox: yeah, quizes like that can't really tell you anything except "do you agree with the result or not" 
 MadKnight: they might have their own reasons
 MadKnight: some people play RPG games as female character to be getting cool items as presents from other players
 AntiSquid: depends
 AntiSquid: you can play female char and not act like a girl lol
 MadKnight: i mean from some random people who haven't figured out yet that u don't act like a girl at all 
 AntiSquid: there are girls that play male chars
 orangesnowfox: ^ that too
 AntiSquid: those that want favours put up the act to get them
 MadKnight: i knew a girl who played male char - she says she didn't want the attention
 AntiSquid: i play female chars some times, didn't want to stare at a guy the entire time
 orangesnowfox: ... That's valid but uhh, I've heard that line before
 AntiSquid: ha
 megarami: hi
 megarami: ja imam djevojku, vi nemate tralalalalala
 MadKnight: jwhat
 orangesnowfox: MadKnight, doesn't that mean the people giving weird attention are at fault?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z13qnzUQwuI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z13qnzUQwuI</a>
 AntiSquid: i think he is singing this song
 MadKnight: depends on the game probably
 orangesnowfox: wym?
 MadKnight: Gunther? the penguin from that cartoon&#160;?
 orangesnowfox:  ???
 AntiSquid: idk either what he means
 MadKnight: orangesnowfox depends on how often u need to talk to other people i mean
 MadKnight: AntiSquid Gunther thing was about your link
 AntiSquid: what?
 AntiSquid: that's not a penguin, just a guy with glasses
 AntiSquid: he's not even roleplaying as penguin
 orangesnowfox: MadKnight, I can't understand how those two things relate
 MadKnight: in Adventure Time there's a penguin with that name
 orangesnowfox: No... I mean "giving weird attention" and "how often you have to talk to people"
 AntiSquid: but that has nothing to do with your cartoons MadKnight
 MadKnight: orangesnowfox well for example when u are on a game's market and u ask people for some stuff as a girl....
 MadKnight: AntiSquid but that is a cartoon
 AntiSquid: i linked a song, which is older than the shitty cartoon
 MadKnight: hmmm seems to be true, but i thought of that cartoon when i saw that name
 MadKnight: orangesnowfox some games are not real-time, they're turn-based, and in those games there's usually a chat where people talk while waiting for their turn, and sometimes u might need to say stuff in some locational chat
 orangesnowfox: okay?
 MadKnight: hmmm, what exactly did u mean by "the people giving weird attention are at fault" orangesnowfox&#160;?
 MadKnight: i think i misunderstand u at this
 orangesnowfox: Okay, so, if you ask for help with things on an rpg, I think you can agree it's reasonable for people to give or not give help as they please. The bit I find weird and mildly gross, is that people playing girl characters get more help, not because of the help, but... Ulterior motives are pretty common
 orangesnowfox: Like, if you'd only help someone because they're "a girl"...
 MadKnight: that's not it
 MadKnight: they're giving extra bonuses
 MadKnight: it can be them just being gentlemen in general
 AntiSquid: being gentlemen giving favours in exchange for allusion to other favours :thinking:
 AntiSquid: then again some couples met in RPGs, which is funny i guess
 MadKnight: in exchange for them feeling good from doing that actually
 MadKnight: AntiSquid they're wasting game resources for having a good time, what's wrong&#160;?
 jacek: oO
 davilla: is there an archive of past puzzles of the week?
 AntiSquid: no but they're all available so it doesn't matter
 davilla: ah so they just become regular puzzles at that point, thanks
 AntiSquid: no, actually weekly puzzle are regular puzzles that are highlited
 HunterEhrenfeld: Whats up friends
 HunterEhrenfeld: Nothing like coffee and clash of code in the evening 
 SaidRasinlic: i swear i cant do a shit with these tasks
 SaidRasinlic: is anyone here junior developer
 HunterEhrenfeld: Im starting a junior role in the summer
 SaidRasinlic: java developer?
 SaidRasinlic: anyone?
 HunterEhrenfeld: Yes, I work with APIs in Java and Ruby
 SaidRasinlic: nice man
 SaidRasinlic: how u doing with these tasks
 HunterEhrenfeld: Which tasks?
 SaidRasinlic: i know some of them but mostly not
 SaidRasinlic: in the clash 
 SaidRasinlic: clash of code
 HunterEhrenfeld: I can get most of the tasks. Sometimes I struggle on binary stuff though
 SaidRasinlic: yea man 
 SaidRasinlic: thats true
 SaidRasinlic: i dont know i was never good with math
 SaidRasinlic: but i know language more than enough.. so..
 HunterEhrenfeld: Yeah, sometimes math ones get me too 
 SaidRasinlic: man sometime its so dumb and easy but math scares you haha
 HunterEhrenfeld: math can be very scary lol
 SaidRasinlic: but as they said just keep coding :D
 Wontonimo: math is like reading.  if you do it every day and for fun, it becomes easier.  there just isn't any romance equations... but if you look and try, you'll find something to math every day
 SaidRasinlic: ye thats true 
 HunterEhrenfeld: Does Clash of Code have bots?
 HunterEhrenfeld: I see BSoD like everyday lol
 SaidRasinlic: man maybe it does lol
 Uljahn: there are official bots to fill up the room

 mabdulrafey: can anybody help me out
 Mitul-P14: what language?
 Mitul-P14: yikes not exactly sure how to go about that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's a couple ways, are there time constraints?
 mabdulrafey: Nevermind
 mabdulrafey: i lost it  :(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh its a clash?
 mabdulrafey: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be119611-eca6-4747-b671-72cb1f3ed596">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be119611-eca6-4747-b671-72cb1f3ed596</a>
 mabdulrafey: Help me out with this one
 mabdulrafey: python 3
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, intdiv(n,4)+1  maybe
 mabdulrafey: print(round(int(input())/4))
 mabdulrafey: I wrote this out
 mabdulrafey: It worked
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh is on first tile, so ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't clash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: much
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and not in oy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: py
 mabdulrafey: which language you practice
 mabdulrafey: i am like "hello world" type beginner 
 mabdulrafey: xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, PY is fine, but i wouldn't ignore C++
 Mitul-P14: ayyy c++ bros
 linjoehan: I am in here now!
 Mitul-P14: "i am here"
 Mitul-P14:  - All Might and Deku
 linjoehan: mabdulrafey depends on what you want to achieve
 linjoehan: if(I want to make awesome bots) { "c++"} else if(I want to get a job) {"java | python} else if(I just want to have fun) { "whatever you want"}
 linjoehan: at least thats what I think
 Mitul-P14: string choice = "I just want to have fun"
 Mitul-P14: **presses CTRL + ENTER**
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Is this where we do a ctrl+alt+f4?
 AnushaDsouza: what about c#?
 linjoehan: yeah I was about to try that in there but I decided not to
 Mitul-P14: if you want to patrick
 Mitul-P14: ctrl alt f4 is never denied in this safe haven
 linjoehan: NO!
 Mitul-P14: its his computer. we cant tell him not to
 Mitul-P14: as his friend as of 1 minute its my obligation to support him no matter what
 PatrickMcGinnisII: working on neighbor-sum grids, so ctrl+alt+f4 might be the solution
 Mitul-P14: might is an understatement
 linjoehan: also CTRL + ALT + DEL is a bad idea because you might be in Linux, that has happened to me before, no I wasn't the one hitting the buttons I was the one having to deal with the consequences.
 Mitul-P14: is it the same as f4?
 Mitul-P14: also what other practicing code sites do you guys go to&gt;
 Mitul-P14: *?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reboot linux
 Mitul-P14: oh no
 Mitul-P14: :scream:
 linjoehan: yeah! some guy plugged a keyboard into the wrong server and thought it was windows
 Mitul-P14: yikes
 Mitul-P14: but uh any other code practicing sites?
 linjoehan: are you just learning or do you want to compete (for last place
 linjoehan: )
 linjoehan: )
 linjoehan: )
 linjoehan: man that did not go well
 Mitul-P14: mainly learing / advancing 
 Mitul-P14: lol
 linjoehan: hackerrank is good for learning but the competitive scene there has died out a bit

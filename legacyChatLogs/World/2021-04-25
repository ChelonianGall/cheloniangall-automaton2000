 DCoderOP: if you are free, please join us in a clash
 DCoderOP: more coders, more fun
 OBenjOne: do you know hw to make your pod racers say things in coders strike back? I'm in gold and can't think of anything else to do
 Ultrixx: dcoderop: how do you like c++ in comparison?
 VizGhar: OBenjOne most of the time you can print message by adding more text after your output
 VizGhar: fe.: 1 1 1 hello
 VizGhar: yup... works for CSB as well
 VizGhar: jeez, I should finally try to implement that one...
 AntiSquid: then do something else, better than nothing OBenjOne, there are other multiplayers on CG

 Passifi: anyone ever feel like motivation drop as your project grows bigger&#160;? When my code grows beyond a certain size my projects always seem to become exponentially harder to handle :worried:
 Michael_Howard: @Passifi yes, you have to take steps earlier in development to manage the complexity, or chaos will eat your project.
 Tadatadatadam: maybe but i small big project but i have big idea, it i watching. idea = very lovely beautiful and like idea, maybe its only, if not job (for money )this project , big idea, big simple small code in one big project, for motivation idea you place transform into you mind and you loke idea simple. Concentraition on you idea like object realy

 Aya_Noaman: i want to hear everyones opinions on clash bots
 BlaiseEbuth: clash bots?
 Miki09: why?
 MSmits: good conversationalists, dry humor, I like them
 ukHK: very dry but i also like them
 struct: Is one player MCTS vs another algo a bad idea?
 MSmits: what do you mean exactly?
 struct: Like I would use MCTS and would use something else for opponent
 struct: Like on FB
 MSmits: generally you only control one side...
 struct: Msmits its the same problem
 struct: on fb I cant use smitsimax
 struct: I cant recall what you told me before&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: No, he means like you might MCTS yourself and GA the opponent
 Astrobytes: I think
 struct: yes
 MSmits: mcts doesn't like it when a gamestate gives a different result at different times
 MSmits: at least on the selection level
 MSmits: the simulation level is random anyways, doesnt matter there
 struct: So it would only work vs deterministic?
 MSmits: if you're using GA i dont understand why it would work at all
 MSmits: but that's just me
 struct: Yeah I think it would face the same problems
 struct: But what about heuristics?
 MSmits: you can combine minimax with mcts though
 struct: oh
 struct: Sh*t
 MSmits: minimax always gives you the same result, so thats fine
 struct: tyvm MSmits
 VizGhar: what is smitsimax?
 Astrobytes: A UCT forest 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax</a>
 VizGhar: tnx
 MSmits: you've been waiting to say that Astrobytes :P
 Astrobytes: You know it :D
 VizGhar: no idea what UCT forest is, but one answered question per day is more then enough :P
 MSmits: it's just multiple mcts game trees running in parallel
 Astrobytes: It's a more descriptive name for Smitsimax. A bunch of trees - yeah what Smits said
 MSmits: the trees affect eachother through the gamestate
 MSmits: which kind of makes it lose coherence, but also tends to converge on good moves in some games
 struct: as long as the opponent actions dont affect your future possible actions its a good choice
 VizGhar: impresive&#160;:) thank you guys
 MSmits: or as long as they don't affect future actions too much. Marchete pointed out to me, you can have a backup action in case the selected action is not available
 struct: in which game did he do it?
 MSmits: PCR, xmas rush i know for sure
 MSmits: PCR he did it better than I did, xmas rush not sure, maybe also
 MSmits: yurko also used it in pcr, also better than i did
 MSmits: it makes a lot of sense in that game
 MSmits: btw in FB, smitsimax could still be possible
 Astrobytes: spells would be tricky no?
 MSmits: but you need to have two possible sets of actions, for when you can shoot and for when you dont have the thingy
 MSmits: generally you would not use spells inside the tree
 MSmits: just as a first level action, based on heuristics
 Astrobytes: makes sense
 struct: This was my attempt :p
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/542994719">https://www.codingame.com/replay/542994719</a>
 struct: I stopped at silver I think
 struct: But I didnt code spells
 MSmits: looks like kid soccer
 struct: the last goal is a bit interesting
 struct: I didnt code spells though
 struct: low ammount of sims
 struct: like 40-50k
 MSmits: apparently it is ok to ignore spells for most of the way to top legend
 struct: it is
 MSmits: the problem is a bit similar to br2k
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/542995518">https://www.codingame.com/replay/542995518</a>
 struct: My bot is at least a bit smart
 struct: frame 110
 MSmits: yeah its not bad
 struct: too bad my 100 lines of js did better than my 2k lines of c++
 Astrobytes: Although, if you have to point out which frame your bot is smart on... :P
 MSmits: good point
 MSmits: apparently js &gt; c++ * 20
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: just add "heuristic moves"
 Marchete: maybe it works
 Marchete: like move id = 0 means go to neares snaffle
 Marchete: things like that
 MSmits: yeah and have alternatives for when you can shoot and when you cant
 Marchete: you can "add" heuristic behaviour as a substitute of a dumb N angle
 Marchete: the problem? it probably dominate all other dumb angles
 Marchete: as its more directed to certain goal (taking a snaffle)
 MSmits: yeah i dont think you should mix heuristic choices with dumb ones
 Marchete: why not
 MSmits: well you just said so
 Marchete: I mean
 AntiSquid: how do you squeeze gamestate into something tiny&#160;?
 MSmits: because one is immediately good or reasonably good and the other needs to converge
 Marchete: then the problem is that heuristic AI is better?
 MSmits: bitboards AntiSquid
 MSmits: Marchete in the short term yes
 MSmits: you need to get some depth before dumb choices become good
 AntiSquid: bitboarding fantastic bits&#160;? like how everything hax coordinates
 MSmits: oh you mean for FB
 AntiSquid: has *
 MSmits: probably dont save the gamestate on the node
 MSmits: just the moves
 AntiSquid: so how do you keep track of stuff&#160;?
 MSmits: in a gamestate that is separate from the tree
 MSmits: and when you go through the tree, you keep applying moves and simulating
 MSmits: if you need to undo, just copy the gamestate
 MSmits: and reassign old gamestate when undo-ing
 AntiSquid: ya you need to reset back to initial don't you ...
 struct: thanks for the tips
 MSmits: yeah keep a copy if it's mcts
 MSmits: thats what i always do
 MSmits: for minimax, keep a copy before every move
 MSmits: sometimes undo is a very simple operation, then you dont need copy
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: moving a piece in chess for example
 MSmits: just change the position and maybe make an oppontent piece you've taken reappear
 AntiSquid: sometimes the 50ms make me think i should bot some real games instead, more time available 
 Astrobytes: eh, where's the fun in that
 AntiSquid: true AI that passes turing test&#160;?
 MSmits: well, the fact that required time is exponential with depth always means the effect of extra time is disappointing
 MSmits: you can have 10x as much time and only get 1 or 2 more depth
 AntiSquid: speaking from experience?
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: it's easy to test with minimax
 MSmits: just test how many iterations you get for iterative deepening
 MSmits: if you do time x 10
 AntiSquid: minimax is incredibly slow compared to alternatives
 MSmits: depth-wise it should not matter much whether you use minimax or mcts
 MSmits: it scales with time similarly
 MSmits: say you get to 10 depth with minimax and between 5 and 15 with mcts
 MSmits: you add 2 levels and its 12 and 7-17
 MSmits: simplified ofc.
 MSmits: with mcts you might hit end of game situations using a solver, that might mess things up a bit though
 DinoCoder649: hi
 MSmits: hi
 DinoCoder649: im a pro 
 MSmits: at
 DinoCoder649: python
 DinoCoder649: java
 DinoCoder649: c++
 DinoCoder649: and
 DinoCoder649: dart
 Astrobytes: Cool. Now do bot programming.
 DinoCoder649: ko
 DinoCoder649: ok
 MSmits: or darts
 DinoCoder649: yeah
 AntiSquid: do xmas rush DinoCoder649
 DinoCoder649: k
 DinoCoder649: and i know bot flip
 AntiSquid: it's best for pros
 DinoCoder649: ok
 MSmits: or botters of the galaxy right AntiSquid?
 DinoCoder649: y4era
 DinoCoder649: hj
 DinoCoder649: FUCK
 AntiSquid: no, xmas rush now, get legend, otherwise not pro
 MSmits: also the only F-word we use is F#
 AntiSquid: must be his reaction to xmas rush, maybe he figured out the algo already
 AntiSquid: he is a pro
 Astrobytes: good point
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, lots of words start with pro ... someday i wanna upgrade by amateur stitute status.
 Xeylo: glhf to all of you on anything you do&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: even if it's bad&#160;? 
 Xeylo: ahh... except bad things
 AntiSquid: too late, Automaton2000 successfully committed credit card fraud, twice, because you
 Automaton2000: took me like 5 hours
 NinjaDoggy: :O in just 5 hours :O
 Xeylo: if whatyoudo == good:
 Westicles: glhf... an odd choice to compress that sentence
 AntiSquid: ya besides some people jokingly use it to mean something else
 Xeylo: not my choice.. it has been around since (insert a relatively old event here)
 AntiSquid: and good is subjective, for example jehova's witnesses think they do good when they pester you at your own door
 PatrickMcGinnisII:  “Captain Insano shows no mercy.” -Bobby Boucher
 Xeylo: stop distracting me im trying to clash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 Why are alligators so ornery?
 Automaton2000: mcts is a bit slow
 AntiSquid: see? i think distracting you from clash is good and who's forcing you to read chat anyway? Xeylo&#160;?
 Xeylo: me. cuz i dont understand this specific clash lol D:
 Westicles: We can help, but only if you pose it as an ethical question
 Xeylo: nah im trying to understand it. im no cheater
 N00b_er: hmm guys.
 N00b_er: can i ask something?
 AntiSquid: you just did!
 Xeylo: and girls, and others
 AntiSquid: your quote of questions is up for today, sorry
 AntiSquid: quota *
 N00b_er: lol...
 AntiSquid: tough life
 N00b_er: so here is the question: What is cribbage mean?
 Xeylo: i rage quit this clash cuz idk what peter earns from uber or something idk
 Xeylo: cribbage is a card game i think
 AntiSquid: Xeylo, then answer N00b_er's question
 AntiSquid: slow reading sry Q_Q
 Xeylo: and cabbage
 Westicles: 1/4 of 1% of clashes are about cribbage
 AntiSquid: no, just crib, so cribbage as in simple, baby's play thing
 Xeylo: i have a crib, i have a cabbage... ah.. cribbage
 N00b_er: dang... i dont know his rule..
 Astrobytes: crabbage
 N00b_er: is so new for me
 Xeylo: quick ppap maths
 AntiSquid: cribbage = very very very easy
 AntiSquid: something like that for sure
 Westicles: sorry, should have been 2/5.  Anyhow, 4/1000
 AntiSquid: do you leave comments calling them "cribbage", Westicles&#160;?
 Westicles: Hmmm
 Xeylo: so hows ur day?

 orangesnowfox: Which, seems like the thing you want to have *not* happen
 jacek: converges to what
 MSmits: to a single point. It burns right through those checkpoints

 Zihan7749: how to beat Boss 2 AI
 orangesnowfox: what game?
 Zihan7749: AI
 Passifi: as long as there are poor people in need of a quick buck the supply is secure do not you worry
 Zihan7749: ok?
 orangesnowfox: Zihan7749, yes, you want to beat the Boss 2 AI, but for which game / puzzle, there are a *lot*
 Zihan7749: but... someone help me plese
 Zihan7749: this is in lernd

 Smelty: okay
 Smelty: so for coders strike back, 
 Smelty: wood league 2?
 Smelty: put thrust "100"
 Zihan7749: yes
 Smelty: and boost if distance&gt;5000
 Smelty: and if you have the angle, thrust 10 if angle&gt;90
 Smelty: or angle&lt;270
 Zihan7749: ok thanks
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 Smelty: tell me if it works
 Zihan7749: ok

 struct: please someone stop me
 Smelty: 0.0
 struct: give me another code about early optimizations
 struct: quote*
 orangesnowfox: Smely, how much time are you using per turn?
 Smelty: “The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming."
 orangesnowfox: Smelty
 orangesnowfox: heck
 Smelty: orangesnowfox i was just testing
 Smelty: with a simple code
 Smelty: if/else
 Smelty: no way that it was time out xD
 orangesnowfox: ah... It's going to be in the ref's repo anyway :p
 Smelty: tru
 Astrobytes: Stop it struct. Fix Amazons.
 jacek: oh my
 Astrobytes: Or go for a walk or something.
 orangesnowfox: So, my newest fixation (after opting my search race a little) is mars lander... Is angle an int? it seems like angle is an int
 jacek: submit amazons. maybe it will be next potw now
 eulerscheZahl: or POTW during the next contest
 jacek: next appriopriate time would afer xontest
 jacek: contest even
 jacek: why would anyone have POTW during contest :x
 orangesnowfox: POTW?
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle of the weak
 orangesnowfox: ah
 BlaiseEbuth: Play Of The Week: eulerscheZahl with Automaton2000
 eulerscheZahl: i lied to you about the acronym&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Who was it that always used to say that?
 Automaton2000: pretty sure there is a way to see other people's solutions
 Astrobytes: "puzzle of the weak" that is
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 struct: so much to do
 eulerscheZahl: check that logs
 struct: and im so slow&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: that logs eh
 Astrobytes: At least you can type struct :P
 eulerscheZahl: where is zarthaxx btw? he ditched codejam
 Astrobytes: AVX
 Astrobytes: Hm, he must be busy
 eulerscheZahl: where are my 3D dice?
 eulerscheZahl: and where's my shrine benjaminUrquhart?
 Astrobytes: Who's doing 3D dice?
 eulerscheZahl: zarthaxx's girlfriend
 AntiSquid: what happern?
 Astrobytes: And you rarely see Benjamin around these days
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just trolling about the shrine, i like the square
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like the movement animation, not pixel perfect
 Astrobytes: Shocking. Totally ruins everything. Shame on you.
 eulerscheZahl: the asset was inconsistent with the padding and I didn't wanted to fix it&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: now I think about it every time i open the game
 Astrobytes: lol, that would be annoying
 jacek: whta game
 eulerscheZahl: onitama
 Astrobytes: oni- yes
 jacek: the easy one?
 jacek: the bosses there are weak
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 eulerscheZahl: there's only 1 boss which is depth 1 search to capture
 Astrobytes: such insolence
 eulerscheZahl: stops random bots, that's the only intention
 jacek: even opponents are weak
 Astrobytes: So, onitama really is a game of the weak
 jacek: recurse should come back to it, i need a challenge
 Astrobytes: He seems to have quit so don't hold your breath. Might still be smurfing around though.
 struct: I need to update grid cords or is not needed?
 jacek: ask :coffee: about it
 eulerscheZahl: grid cords? if that's music related i'm out
 struct: euler you joining cg contest?
 eulerscheZahl: probably
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't like the time
 eulerscheZahl: last weekend collides with codejam
 struct: maybe you will like the game
 eulerscheZahl: which i put over CG
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand might be the last CG contest for a very long time
 eulerscheZahl: i don't count escape rooms as contests if that's what they plan for the future
 struct: Maybe this one is an escape room
 struct: 12 days escape
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure you'll like the board shape of the next contest
 struct: Damn, Im hoping for phyiscs
 Therabidpanther: is it possible to do codingame on IntelliJ?
 eulerscheZahl: going to bed now, see you in May i guess

 VizGhar: Therabidpanther you can write your code where you want&#160;:)
 Therabidpanther: right, but i think i saw somewhere that IntelliJ had actual integration or something
 AntiSquid: isn't it just ex-wife then&#160;?
 Therabidpanther: poor frog

 struct: ok
 VizGhar: Therabidpanther its plugin for browser not for intellij. I haven't use it yer (and probably don;t plan to). Plugin for IntelliJ would be more fun&#160;:)
 VizGhar: jeez, cant hit correct keys in dark...
 AntiSquid: you need to look at your keyboard to type&#160;?! normally you should undergo a coding camp where you type in pitch black darkness before you start here 
 AntiSquid: real life coding boot camp
 VizGhar: I dont need to, but i make typos&#160;:| not trying to fix them here in chat that much
 VizGhar: Ive never been to boot camp... wonder if there are some in my country
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 send him to the coding boot camp, he also needs to adjust to different sized keyboards

 Astrobytes: how scarily appropriate
 VizGhar: flood ^^ kick him out
 AntiSquid: i think that's the start of your boot camp VizGhar
 AntiSquid: decode it
 VizGhar: o.O
 struct: Ok I need to change a few more things I think
 Astrobytes: As darkhorse64 said it's not a trivial change
 Astrobytes: If you're talking about the board thing
 struct: yes
 struct: I think he also changed how you read the board
 struct: so from bottom to top o.o
 AntiSquid: are you still talking about onitama or something else&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Amazons
 VizGhar: When was the last time solo contest occurs?
 Astrobytes: Pikaptcha, can't remember, didn't do it
 AntiSquid: i don't count that as a contest, i'd say a*craft was last solo contest
 Astrobytes: July 20th 2019 was Pikaptcha
 Astrobytes: But it was a solo contest
 AntiSquid: 4 hours when i wasn't even online 
 AntiSquid: ya i don't count it as such
 Astrobytes: I decided to forgo it prior given the 4 hour solo thing
 Astrobytes: Same, but technically it was a contest
 AntiSquid: life is short, maybe i should instantly skip all contests i dislike
 AntiSquid: there are dozens of them out there at any given day of the year
 Astrobytes: a*craft was fun, something like that again would be nice, but that was a community contest also, so not much chance of that
 AntiSquid: i think for a*craft, although i liked it, i also missed it due to long shifts
 AntiSquid: done it after contest
 Astrobytes: I think I did everything on the Sunday morning
 Astrobytes: Must go back to it
 Astrobytes: (one more on the list)
 VizGhar: 4hrs? mhm I'd miss it too :D
 AntiSquid: i did my bot following the postmortems, damn changed things to super easy mode somehow, then dropped with all the hardcoding @_@
 AntiSquid: pikaptcha was 4 hours, a*craft was 2 days
 VizGhar: ah ok...
 AntiSquid: i am not even sure where i was at that time (pikaptcha contest)
 Astrobytes: I strongly dislike 4 hour contests, but I don't mind, some people love them and that's cool
 Astrobytes: As long as servers can cope and (ahem) statements are correct that is
 Therabidpanther: i really miss space cat&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: oh damn i remember where i was, but still wouldn't join pikaptcha even if i had time
 VizGhar: uf I'm very new here... Just single contest so far, and servers were close to death first few hours
 AntiSquid: that's standard
 Astrobytes: Yep
 AntiSquid: but despite all that CG is one of the most user friendly contests out there
 VizGhar: But solo contest (puzzles) shouldn't be so heavy
 Therabidpanther: #banASCIIart
 Astrobytes: Probably *the* most user-friendly
 VizGhar: :D Therabidpanther :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: Therabidpanther <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://programmer.help/images/blog/3ac049ded323d88770260f51fe7e3310.jpg">https://programmer.help/images/blog/3ac049ded323d88770260f51fe7e3310.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: Depends on the format VizGhar. If there are still many people submitting in a short space of time it still impacts.
 VizGhar: sure...
 Therabidpanther: you are burning my eyes
 VizGhar: Have you seen that donut ascii?
 AntiSquid: i dunno RAIC isn't that bad, shit starter, randomness is all that killed the mood for me, halite was well organized
 Astrobytes: CG are not known for doing well on 4 hour contests these days :P
 Therabidpanther: my profile picture is the furthest i will dig into ascii art LMAO
 AntiSquid: Therabidpanther how about that cube in the gif as very hard puzzle and you get lots of XP if you solve it&#160;?
 AntiSquid: would you do it&#160;?
 Therabidpanther: i would not even attempt it
 Astrobytes: I really enjoyed last RAIC, the C++ API was f**king bizarre but I got used to it
 VizGhar: you are weak Therabidpanther
 AntiSquid: 100k xp Therabidpanther, you could retire from puzzles afterwards, would you still not do it?
 Therabidpanther: i would still never
 Therabidpanther: ascii art is against my religion 
 AntiSquid: what if it gave CP too&#160;?
 Therabidpanther: what is cp?
 VizGhar: what exactly is your religion? :D
 AntiSquid: coding points
 Therabidpanther: im not sure even a monetary value could convince me 
 Astrobytes: The Church of Unicode possibly
 AntiSquid: the girl of your dreams serves you a drink in bikini, would you do the puzzle to render that cube like in the gif? Therabidpanther 
 VizGhar: uf though one
 Therabidpanther: if she even mentioned that cube, the drink would be going in her face
 AntiSquid: ok Automaton2000 no point wearing the hyperrealistic mask now
 Automaton2000: but i only get 1 or 2 days ago
 struct: Maybe it is optimization like the accountant
 Astrobytes: That's a little violent
 VizGhar: also if you are member of Unicode Church, you are not allowed to talk to girls
 Therabidpanther: is that a rule?
 VizGhar: you are only member... tell us
 AntiSquid: geez, he'd throw a good drink and refuse his dream girl just to avoid rendering a cube, man i don't know what troubles you
 Therabidpanther: As only member, I suppose that means I am the founder
 VizGhar: :D yeah... throw that into linkedin profile
 Therabidpanther: that will give me the edge over others
 Astrobytes: Founder of the Church of UTF-16+
 AntiSquid: can you code in pixels then&#160;? 
 davilla: It would be sad to hear you're the only member of a religion even the founder abandoned.
 Therabidpanther: or would i just be dedicated lol
 waffenSS: hello everyone&#160;:) 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://progopedia.com/language/piet/">http://progopedia.com/language/piet/</a> for you Therabidpanther
 struct: hi
 VizGhar: ah you started just in february? you'll get used to ascii. dont worry
 Therabidpanther: that language is disgusting lol
 VizGhar: or simply stop playing CoC
 Therabidpanther: Im starting to get away from CoC lol
 AntiSquid: reminds me of someone claiming their religion is Chrislam, davilla (they joked they were the founder)
 struct: Whats CoC?
 Therabidpanther: Clash of Code
 struct: hmmm, sounds fun
 jacek: should i invite you
 AntiSquid: it's that dark, grim and dirty corner of the site, the neglected downtown littered with trash that nobody visits struct
 Astrobytes: I'm not really into CoC
 Therabidpanther: i mean, i think its like paradise 
 AntiSquid: ripe with crime and shady business
 Therabidpanther: i play a lot of CoC at work
 Therabidpanther: its pretty fast
 jacek: s/oC/ock
 AntiSquid: BAN
 Therabidpanther: rip
 Astrobytes: that was the joke jacek yes
 jacek: joke?
 AntiSquid: oh wait i got a relatable video for this conversation
 Astrobytes: 'humorous statement'
 Astrobytes: Anyway, what if I was? Would you CoC-shame me?
 VizGhar: battery dying. I wont look for charger now... Good night (and Therabidpanther good mornig probably?)
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: Especially not in the dark VizGhar
 Astrobytes: gn&#160;:)

 Therabidpanther: Good afternoon here VizGhar, but good night 
 Astrobytes: That's very John Dillermand
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: "powered by compressed air, they grow from the tip ... " 0:38
 Tadatadatadam: snake in real o my god
 AntiSquid: it's a pneumatic robot, stop jumping to weird conclusions
 Astrobytes: Still calling John Dillermand on this one
 Astrobytes: Scarfield will agree when he sees it.
 Scarfield: xD
 voidnull: it would be great if there are challenges to make in team
 Scarfield: just sat down, why back at this i wonder 
 Astrobytes: see squids youtube link
 Scarfield: oh yea, seen this one, veritasium is great!
 Astrobytes: Still ...
 Scarfield: john dillermand is matbe a wacky waving inflatable flaling tube variation
 Scarfield: maybe*
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 Astrobytes: I mean, it was only the start of the video that reminded me tbh, the rest was cool
 Scarfield: riight, i know what your dirty mind sees
 AntiSquid: i am sure clashers would love some pneumatic robo puzzles
 Astrobytes: Are you mocking the Eternal Darkness of My Dirty Mind? :P
 jacek:  
 waffenSS: do clashes get gradually higher as you rise up in level? 
 Astrobytes: No.
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: powered by air
 AntiSquid: watch video
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: there should be some "hidden rank" no?
 Astrobytes: waffenSS: (what kind of name is that, seriously), no they don't. Same clashes all the way
 jacek: euler would approve that name eh
 Scarfield: oh, weapon SS, doubt it
 Astrobytes: "Although it's soft, it's still somewhat stiff" - Veritasium 
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Just repeating facts.
 AntiSquid: waffen = weapons btw
 Scarfield: i flunked german in school 
 Astrobytes: Oh really? I'd never have guessed that one AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: why the sarcasm lol
 Astrobytes: When those combine to create the armed division of the SS it's a little... inflammatory no?
 Scarfield: curious: does moderation rules apply to offensive usernames?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I totally misread your 'flunked' :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Scarfield: lol, and ok&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: it's all at moderator's subjective discretion, so yes, ban can be remedied later
 Astrobytes:  /kick for bad username if they continue to engage and don't change it
 AntiSquid: i am joking, anyways i wouldn't consider swastika in the username offensive 
 Scarfield: eh?
 AntiSquid: due to the original meaning
 jacek: ok, AstrobyteSS
 Scarfield: or antiSSquid :p
 AntiSquid: it's highjacked, doesn't mean it's a symbol of evil
 AntiSquid: hijacked *
 jacek: SScarfield
 AntiSquid: jaSSek
 Astrobytes: Well yes, AntiSquid. But, let's face it, who's using it in it's original context these days on the internet?
 Smelty: :eyes:
 AntiSquid: well if you see me using it, then that would be 1 person
 Astrobytes: You know what I mean.
 AntiSquid: some asians afaik
 Therabidpanther: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/702f97a6-6c61-4b10-ab2c-ec2e3728c43c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/702f97a6-6c61-4b10-ab2c-ec2e3728c43c</a>
 Therabidpanther: i did it!
 Therabidpanther: PROgrammer here
 AntiSquid: not joking, seen the symbol there on the streets, doubt it was meaning nazis
 Astrobytes: ...
 Scarfield: ^
 AntiSquid: in parts of SEA
 Astrobytes: yay Therabidpanther you succeeded in posting a full solution in chat!
 Astrobytes: Moving on from touchy subjects, struct: how is it going
 struct: I think ill just use the dirty trick
 therealbeef: the asian religious symbol is mirrored
 struct: and replace every digit
 Scarfield: im getting curious, have you ever banned anyone squid?
 Therabidpanther: wooo
 Astrobytes: lol OK struct
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: yes
 Wojciech_Krol: hi! i have a question- im doing a clobber bot, right now i have a silly  issue... I made a function that evaluates the postition after a move has been made. I also made a function that makes moves. The problem is- i dont know how to insert a board in which a move has been made to the evaluation, without actually making the move. Whats the best solution to this?
 AntiSquid: didn't pay attention to that detail, in hindu too?
 Smelty: hmm
 Astrobytes: Yes AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: But it's found in multiple orientations I believe
 Astrobytes: And if you find it as graffiti on a wall, it's not because someone is really into their Asian religion.
 AntiSquid: well you don't grafitti jesus either ...
 AntiSquid: not often
 AntiSquid: wasnt talking about graffiti though
 Astrobytes: Wojciech_Krol: In clobber the moves are very simple, so an undo  move function is not hard to make.Evaluate the board when the move has been made, then undo, and continue evaluating moves
 Smelty: `-`
 AntiSquid: for clobber you def copy states with bitboards
 AntiSquid: as alternative
 Astrobytes: It's literally just toggling bits
 Wojciech_Krol: so just make the move then undo it?
 struct: is darkhorse64 version on github the same version that is on cg?
 struct: I cant find how he changes the actions..
 Astrobytes: yes struct
 AntiSquid: he maybe hid it
 Astrobytes: Wojciech_Krol yes
 Wojciech_Krol: ok
 Wojciech_Krol: thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: make move, eval, then undo
 Astrobytes: repeat&#160;:)
 Scarfield: make move, eval, then undo
 AntiSquid: took me a while to find the brensenham application in cultist wars on bloody bitbucket
 Astrobytes: Thank you ScarfieldScarfieldScarfieldScarfieldScarfield that will be all :P
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bitbucket.org/Nixerrr/cultist-wars/src/master/src/main/java/model/Board.java#lines-277">https://bitbucket.org/Nixerrr/cultist-wars/src/master/src/main/java/model/Board.java#lines-277</a> should be linked directly in statement @_@
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know right AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: I still need to fix my broken bot there
 jacek: will clobber be next POTW?
 Astrobytes: Would be an interesting one
 Astrobytes: It's deceptively simple looking so would pull a lot of people in
 Illedan: :tada:
 Scarfield: you won a ps5 ille?
 Astrobytes: You have succeeded in what Illedan?

 Astrobytes: On the way and making it Illedan!
 AntiSquid: 2l weight on onboarding? wdym&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 2k *
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Yeah lol, I didn't play that for a while incidentally
 Illedan: Number of weights in my mlp graph
 AntiSquid: silverfish was a fun bot, or whatever its called Astrobytes
 jacek: mlp? :horse:
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: MLPs were a popular machine learning solution in the 1980s,   - wiki
 Scarfield: was just about to mention that you have "learned" associate mlp with something else
 AntiSquid: Multilayer perceptron ... oh 
 Smelty: interesting
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: yeah I remember Silverfish, never got into working with hearthstone AIs though
 Astrobytes: well, bots, whatever
 Astrobytes: My Little Perceptrons
 AntiSquid: was bruteforce approach from what i remember
 Pintoe: how do you create a game with your friends
 Smelty: clash?
 zarkos: you message deez
 Smelty: hold over the clash symbol
 Smelty: and click the 3 dots and choose private
 Pintoe: where is the clash symbol
 AntiSquid: guess i never learn, eh?

 AntiSquid: how's life roxx&#160;?
 AntiSquid: any progress Roxxx? :P
 Roxxx: hey mate, i worked on what the sketched out yesterday!
 Roxxx: so far i got the cultist to move and convert random dudes but not much else
 Roxxx: here's a replay lol
 Astrobytes: :wave: Roxxx
 AntiSquid: pm or discord pls
 Astrobytes: You recruiting cultists eh AntiSquid :P
 GIPOKE: i had the shortest code in a shortest mode clash and i only got 25%
 AntiSquid: no, he picked the game
 AntiSquid: was going to do tryangle
 Astrobytes: You doing the pair thing?
 GIPOKE: and it was so easy too
 Smelty: o . o

 Roxxx: im just sharing a replay
 Astrobytes: Cool beans, nice one for doing that AntiSquid&#160;:)
 Roxxx: it reveals nothing&#160;:)
 Smelty: that one moving dude of yours: *shifts nervously*
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes thanks&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: share on discord ony the code .. curious what bits you implemented
 Roxxx: AntiSquid is so cool, we brainstormed yesterday for hours xD
 AntiSquid: i changerd mine a bit
 AntiSquid: was about to add the bresenham ..
 Roxxx: so i tried to go with the C++ code and strugled a lot 
 Roxxx: then i decided to go full jaca
 Roxxx: java*
 Roxxx: lolz xD
 AntiSquid: oh its ok i;ll try reading it
 AntiSquid: i can code java nw
 Roxxx: ok im sending it over at discord
 Astrobytes: (he just hates it :D )
 AntiSquid: but switch to c++ when yu can
 Astrobytes: C# - happy medium?
 Roxxx: 1 min
 Smelty: *sad c noises*
 AntiSquid: my eyes arent adjusted to linq
 AntiSquid: D has something similar i tghink ... saw a demo 
 Astrobytes: Hey come on, C++ with linq would be nice
 waffenSS: about to win my first clash&#160;:) 
 waffenSS: nvm 
 AntiSquid: i dont find your username offensive, but rather very lame... 
 AntiSquid: might as well name yourself BananaCream
 Astrobytes: Lame yes. Offensive not to me or you, but could be to others.
 AntiSquid: also from tunisia ... hm strange
 Astrobytes: Not 'offensive' as in 'eh, I don't like that' but you know...
 AntiSquid: get an avatar at least 
 Astrobytes: Unsure why you find that strange
 AntiSquid: maybe its not
 Roxxx: guys im trying to help smelty with a game but i cant see his replay, it says i'm not authorized, anyone knows what's this about?
 Smelty: ^^
 Roxxx: OupsAn error occurred (#UNAUTHORIZED): "You are not authorised to view replay 543057554"
 Astrobytes: Is it a pending contribution or a published game?
 Smelty: oo..contribution
 Smelty: maybe thats why
 Astrobytes: It is
 Smelty: okay
 Astrobytes: Also, Roxxx, aren't you supposed to be working on Cultist Wars :P
 Smelty: eeep
 Roxxx: I am but i try to help when i can
 Roxxx: you guys always help me, so i wanna contribute back
 Astrobytes: Concentrate when required
 Astrobytes: And Smelty: you can always ask in main chat
 Smelty: sorr
 Smelty: TwT
 Astrobytes: Good ethos though Roxxx&#160;:)
 Smelty: im coding in java
 Astrobytes: Don't worry Smelty, not having a go
 Smelty: so i thought that rox, being a java programmer could hel
 Smelty: :p
 Astrobytes: Yep, I get that, it's cool&#160;:)
 Smelty: but in any case, my system is still not go
 Astrobytes: What are you working on?
 Smelty: eep
 Smelty: simple ai for troll vs castl
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Smelty: contribution; im tryna do a if/else
 Smelty: but i fail
 Astrobytes: I'd move on for now :rofl:
 Smelty: sad face
 Smelty: it just that idk whats wrong 
 Smelty: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Everything! Move on to another contribution or game :D
 Astrobytes: JBM will forgive you
 JBM: i'm way too lenient these days
 Smelty: :0

 davilla: if/else is level 26, you'll get there
 Smelty: when my code doesn't work: *confused ooga booga*when my code works:
 Smelty: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: tbf, TvC has the best graphics and adjustable parameters on all of CG
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: tru
 Smelty: its the only game in which you can adjust the troll's pants
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed. Indeed it is.
 JBM: the feature you never knew you needed
 Astrobytes: When merch tho
 JBM: lost some steam on that
 Smelty:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: What's the points on it now? Cba to look
 Astrobytes: I know 'a lot' covers it :D
 Smelty: breeeeeeeeeeeh i coded so that it would show opponent-opponentStones and difference(opponent-opponentStones from last turn) and to show if it passes the if of if those two are equal
 Smelty: the error stream said that they were the same
 Smelty: but it didnt pass the if for some reason
 Smelty: TwT
 Astrobytes: I don't know wtf this TwT means, but you should definitely keep playing TvC, until the contest, and maybe during if the notion takes you
 Astrobytes: And continue after
 Smelty: sorry&#160;:(
 Smelty: also it means this i believe: :sob:
 Astrobytes: I see
 Smelty: -.-| |
 Astrobytes: Right, I see the connection
 Smelty: _ _|.|
 Smelty: lol
 Astrobytes: But if emojis are available, why not use them instead of indecipherable glyphs
 Astrobytes: *glyph sequences
 Smelty: hrmmm....
 Smelty: well 3 chars is easier to type from an energy perspective compared to 5 chars
 Smelty: but yes
 Astrobytes: If you're *that* concerned about your energy usage you might need to make some lifestyle adjustments
 Smelty: xD
 Astrobytes: Or write perl
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: nah, i'd waste too much energy figuring out da heck the code means
 Astrobytes: It's quite cool actually. I'm way out of shape with it but it's lovely. At least 5 was
 Smelty: lol
 Astrobytes: My Raku knowledge is lacking so I can't comment on further manifestations of said lang
 Smelty: o.o
 Astrobytes: I mean it beggars belief (to me at least) that python (of all the scripting langs of linux at the time) should turn out to be ultra-popular
 Smelty: perl 6 go brr
 Astrobytes: Like I said, my Raku knowledge is lacking
 Smelty: Yes
 Smelty: "FORTH is the most powerful programming language" -TvC troll, 2021
 Astrobytes: These are carefully considered troll comments you know
 Astrobytes: One of these days, a youtube influencer will discover VB and there will be mayhem.
 orangesnowfox: oh. oh no.
 davilla: So if I delete a post in reply to the wrong person, and repost in response to the correct person, the "body is too similar to a recent post"? Fine, Coding Game doesn't need to know what it doesn't want to know.
 Astrobytes: lol, in the forum davilla?
 Smelty: pj mp
 davilla: yes... this website sometimes, I swear!
 Smelty: *lol
 Astrobytes: Just the spam filter in effect, just wait a minute or two. It's... sensitive&#160;:)
 Smelty: sorry forgot to translate from alien
 davilla: heh, not *nearly* as sensitive as me&#160;:-P
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Smelty: lol
 Astrobytes: also, on topic for you davilla: it's always a tricky subject
 Astrobytes: The 'difficulty' issue
 Smelty: :rofl:
 davilla: I think it's a lot more straightforward than people make it out to be. And there are definitely some puzzles I've run across that are miscategorized.
 Astrobytes: A lot of that happened when CG merged the community-made puzzles with the official CG puzzles
 davilla: when I'm ranked high enough, I'm going to go thru and add labels to a lot of these
 davilla: some have no skill tags whatsoever, some invent their own
 Astrobytes: Some of the more mathematical-knowledge-heavy puzzles stump me at first, but if you do some research and learn about it, you can come back and solve. So, difficulty in some respects is in the eye of the solver I guess
 davilla: oh yes, that much is true
 davilla: even within computing concepts, one idea can trivialize a problem, but it may be a very deep idea
 Astrobytes: Yes absolutely
 <b>**Smelty googles how to find deep ideas</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: And the tagging issue is probably not gonna go away I suspect
 davilla: careful, the search results might return things like "modular calculus"
 Smelty: augh
 <b>**Astrobytes shudders</b></p><p><img src="/a/62601482690550" /> <b>**Smelty shudders along</b></p><p><img src="/a/60533428846794" /> davilla: it's funny, math texts tend to call things "elementary"
 davilla: like if you find a book on "elementary geometry", don't open it or your eyes will melt
 davilla: you need multivariable calculus to begin to understand elementary geometry
 davilla: so the cryptography guys probably got tired of this, realizing they were doing much harder math than the rest of the programming community
 Astrobytes: Well that *does* depend on which level the textbook is aimed at
 Smelty: oh no,
 davilla: and they invented this term called "modular calculus" to rename "elementary arithmetic"
 davilla: modular calculus isn't a thing as far as I can tell, but it does tag several of the puzzles here
 Astrobytes: modular arithmetic
 AntiSquid: gn8 all
 Astrobytes: gn AntiSquid
 <b>**Tadatadatadam slaps Tadatadatadam going to create something class around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: Strange term but it's modular arithmetic afaik
 davilla: yeah that's probably right
 davilla: but honestly, it's not even at the level of elementary algebra
 davilla: where they do things like treat matrices like numbers and then use that in division
 Andriamanitra: what's the logic behind how many codinpoints you get
 orangesnowfox: Your page should tell you that, there's a&#160;? box
 Andriamanitra: yeah i mean within the categories
 Astrobytes: Or it's related to elementary function arithmetic... I'm not mathematician
 Astrobytes: *no
 Astrobytes: Ah, it's based on TrueSkill algorithm Andriamanitra
 Andriamanitra: why is code golf only 200 but bot programming 5000
 Andriamanitra: i will never get points ;_;
 Astrobytes: Yes you will
 Astrobytes: If you improve your bot programming and optim :P
 davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/modular_calculus">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/modular_calculus</a>
 Andriamanitra: i barely have attention span to read through the description much less to actually solve
 Astrobytes: that's so strange davilla: I would just call it... um, number theory
 Astrobytes: Andriamanitra: then you have some work to do on yourself before you try to solve complex problems :P
 Andriamanitra: my haskell code golf is worth 0/200 points&#160;:(
 struct: guess we have something similar
 orangesnowfox: They uhh... Only update on Reset
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Well, when they update the servers 
 Astrobytes: *database
 orangesnowfox: aka, midnight UTC iirc
 Andriamanitra: oh, maybe there's a chance
 Astrobytes: Did you make some progress in something today Andriamanitra?
 Andriamanitra: i don't think so except for the haskell code golf :D
 Astrobytes: Well, as fox said it won't be updated until 0000 UTC or later (I don't even know what time it happens these days)
 davilla: "applied" is what theoreticians call anything with purpose, when there's no other interest in the concept than the end goal
 Astrobytes: lmao, you ain't wrong
 davilla: quick survey:
 davilla: worst language for code golf?
 Roxxx: bash
 Astrobytes: applied = worker, otherwise = academia
 Astrobytes: Java
 Roxxx: lolz
 davilla: worst as is largest size for optimal solution
 Astrobytes: Or C++
 Astrobytes: Java or C++
 Astrobytes: Probably Java
 davilla: not C#&#160;? huh, OK
 Roxxx: he's just poking at me
 Astrobytes: C# can be condensed a little more than Java iirc
 Astrobytes: Not at all Roxxx!
 Astrobytes: Serious
 Roxxx: no worries, i'm just playing
 davilla: who me? no I agree Bash is godawful to read, but the code is super small
 Astrobytes: I mean you can condense the java a lot 
 Astrobytes: But iirc, you can shorten the C# a lot more
 davilla: I guess C# does have a lot of useful features like nullable types and implicit tuples (forget what they call those)
 Tadatadatadam: i love java and c++
 Astrobytes: Tadatadatadam: Then you should C# too, if not, get some spectacles
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes but isn't the whole beauty of java that it's easy to read
 Roxxx: it's probably one of the most verbose languages but it can be so readable
 struct: java has no unsigned long long?
 struct: What is this
 Tadatadatadam: nto this time C# ty, sorry.  So far I love these 2 languages
 Astrobytes: Roxxx: may I refer you to<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition</a>
 davilla: oh there it is: ValueTuple
 davilla: as of C# 7.0
 Roxxx: @struct there is BigInteger

 davilla: but there are limitations to that since not everything derives from object
 Astrobytes: My favourite feature of C# is not using it
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes, hey those are just naming conventions xD
 Astrobytes: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Astrobytes: Roxxx: :D
 struct: i mostly use c++/javascript
 davilla: I hear you, Micro$oft produces almost nothing but garbage
 Astrobytes: pleasure/pain thing struct
 davilla: they redefine basic math concepts like mod and integer division
 Andriamanitra: my code makes perfect sense and passes all the tests but only gets 6% from validators :thinking:
 Andriamanitra: is the (C) compiler environment different for the validators
 davilla: for 400 years -1 mod 3 is 2, but why value tradition and sense?
 Astrobytes: I try not to judge. I can use C# if I need to. I prefer C++.
 Astrobytes: and lol
 orangesnowfox: Half the people here hate me (not *really*) because I use Rust ^^;
 davilla: why do the other half hate you?
 Astrobytes: Rust is definitely cool
 davilla: just kidding&#160;:-P
 Astrobytes: It's peculiar, but cool
 Roxxx: nothing wrong with rust it's just a bit 'oxidized'
 Astrobytes: Ferris the Crab may take issue with that
 orangesnowfox: They might, they might not
 davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)</a>
 davilla: I don't see any Criticisms
 Astrobytes: I always just love the term 'Rustacean' and Ferris from ferrous. It tickled my biochemical feathers
 davilla: so Rust uses reference counting... can't that still result in memory leaks, with circular references?
 orangesnowfox: "Weird syntax" "I hate borrowck" are the common complaints
 orangesnowfox: davilla: Rust *doesn't* use Reference Counting
 struct: microsoft has been improving
 struct: C# is good
 orangesnowfox: It has Rcs, but they aren't like, required.
 struct: wsl2 is great
 Astrobytes: Syntax is a little different sure, but the borrow checker is cool
 davilla: OK so you can manage it yourself, or you can let the RC handle it, but there's no full-feature Gc
 orangesnowfox: And, also, davilla: Yes, Rc leaks *can* happen, but memory leaks aren't unsafe (neither are deadlocks)
 orangesnowfox: Rust helps you with that first one
 orangesnowfox: No use after free or anything
 davilla: I mean, I guess that's a good compromise
 Astrobytes: It literally tells you when you're f**king up, or warns you that you are on the path to doing so
 davilla: heck, I've had memory leaks in python
 orangesnowfox: Keeps you from having data races, so I consider that *very* nice in any threaded application
 Astrobytes: Anyway, struct has still not completed his mission therefore I shall retire to watch something inane before bed
 struct: sorry astro
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 struct: I will, im just a bit tired
 Andriamanitra: i guess "main(a,b,c,d)" to get around having to "int a,b,c,d;" was too much for the validators even though it worked in ide
 struct: Lots of coding on last days
 Astrobytes: I'm just joking struct man, don't worry&#160;:)
 samueI: hi
 Astrobytes: Honestly, no rush man
 Astrobytes: and consult darkhorse64 if you have any issues with it struct, he's a helpful guy
 struct: I will
 Astrobytes: cool beans, see ya tomorrow man
 Astrobytes: gn all
 struct: cya, gn
 davilla: so this seems like an awful lot of minutia, when borrowck doesn't understand something like slices of an array
 davilla: tell me Rust is worth it because it's at least as fast as C
 orangesnowfox: "Borrowck doesn't understand slices of an array"&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Well, it's on par with C
 davilla: sorry I may not have gotten the lingo right yet
 orangesnowfox: Well, define what you mean
 davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/borrow-splitting.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/borrow-splitting.html</a>
 orangesnowfox: Ah, right... 
 davilla: I mean it's usually pretty useful, I'm sure, but sometimes you have to circumvent
 davilla: whereas with true GC you never have to worry about that stuff... obvious disadvantage being the speed
 orangesnowfox: Well, there's `split_at_mut`, which splits it in arbitrary slices, and first / end splits, which honestly cover 99% of usecases
 orangesnowfox: True, with GC you don't have to deal with it
 orangesnowfox: Rust is competing with C as a "Systems Programming Language" tho
 davilla: OK, so Rust is a way to get the speed of C without as many headaches
 orangesnowfox: "kinda" but let's go with that, it's honestly a nice language over all
 orangesnowfox: Like, I use it in my day to day job (currently backend web dev, *sighs*)
 struct: just weird syntax&#160;:(
 davilla: well do you know any higher level languages? like python, which is built on C?
 orangesnowfox: I know quite a few in fact :p 
 Uljahn: cython&#160;:)
 davilla: hmm syntax was claimed to be C-like, but I don't know about these keywords like impl
 davilla: I guess that's a template?
 davilla: and =&gt; isn't LINQ it's some sort of if/then
 orangesnowfox: LINQ isn't C lol
 davilla: yeah just trying to make sense of it
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/rust/">https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/rust/</a> quick overview of syntax
 davilla: cool thanks
 davilla: what is the general name for what =&gt; does in LINQ? would that be a lambda function, basically?
 orangesnowfox: `(x) =&gt; stuff` is lambda in C# yeah
 davilla: and in Rust?
 davilla: lots and lots of focus on thread safety, everything I've seen goes into it
 davilla: I can only hope to see that in python 4
 davilla: oh =&gt; is used in match statement, which I guess is like a switch
 orangesnowfox: A lambda in Rust is `|&lt;args&gt;*| [-&gt; &lt;Type&gt;] &lt;expr&gt;` ie, `|| foo()` (which is a pretty useless lambda, but still) or `|a| a.bar.baz()`, or `|| -&gt; i32 { eprintln!("what is the meaning of life"); 42 }`
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, `=&gt;` is used in pattern matching, it's somewhat more powerful than a switch (as far as I remember, maybe C# has gained true pattern matching)
 orangesnowfox: Rust also doesn't have null, which is really nice
 davilla: wow, yeah I see some pretty high level stuff with the pattern matching
 davilla: .. like a *
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... There's a lot of stuff, try not to absorb too much at once
 davilla: yeah I think not, but I'll definitely look into it again
 davilla: why the&#160;! is that a function call?
 orangesnowfox: It's a macro
 davilla: OK there's a lot to learn here
 davilla: interesting for sure

 Roxxx: got em to shoot
 Roxxx: but they have no idea what they are shooting at rofl
 Roxxx: my units killed half of neutrals and they keep shooting at obstacles hmm
 Roxxx: there's something seriously wrong with the logic, since i tried to do the opposite
 Tadatadatadam: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Roxxx: exactly
 Tadatadatadam: "In Rust it is unsafe to dereference a raw pointer or call a non-rust function. OpenGL is non-rust, so we will have lots of unsafe fun."
 davilla: Rust is like juggling knives in full body armor
 davilla: and external libraries are like metal detectors
 Tadatadatadam: i like this util
 Tadatadatadam: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">https://github.com/sharkdp/fd</a>
 davilla: where is the about?
 davilla: nevermind readme.md
 Tadatadatadam: I used it as a search, they demanded to install it when you put Emacs
 Tadatadatadam: in the notes it is written that it is written in Rust, I just remember that evening how long it took to grow and this utility
 Tadatadatadam: compilation

 Smelty: what language
 Smelty: i'm not that good at most languages, but I'll try to help
 BigFatDecker: its python im actually trying to set up gpt 2
 BigFatDecker: but in the decoder it says expectin delimiter 
 BigFatDecker: and i cant find where it wants me to put it

 MINGTRAU: dmm
 Littleyounes: why you invite me
 Littleyounes: mingtrau
 Littleyounes: x)
 Littleyounes: m busy
 MINGTRAU: because i like
 Littleyounes: k
 BigFatDecker: so would that show an error in the decoder? because it doesnt show an error in the json and that is the default file that came with gpt 2
 MINGTRAU: oh
 MINGTRAU: i don't understand
 BigFatDecker: i would post the json but its too big
 MINGTRAU: oh
 BigFatDecker: this is impossible
 Alex-1: Smelty it help BigFatDecker stackoverflow is nice

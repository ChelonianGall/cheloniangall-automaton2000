 TheBomb: is there a problem not playing csgo
 Metanoob: oof
 Warphi: me when i
 Warphi: when i when
 LegendaryStone: @anid stealing the solution code from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a> isnt cool&#160;:/
 LegendaryStone: actually try solve it
 eulerscheZahl: and is level 37+ and doesn't need my website. he has direct access to the puzzle list
 eulerscheZahl: anid is*
 LegendaryStone: then whats the point
 struct: euler I found something interesting in stc
 eulerscheZahl: easier to search for a given puzzle when you don't remember the title
 eulerscheZahl: initially i wrote it while moderating pending contributions. there are often duplicates but i can't find the original anymore
 eulerscheZahl: what's interesting struct?
 eulerscheZahl: and are you already or still awake?
 struct: I woke 1 hour ago
 struct: at 5:30
 ChampionCoder: Pls give your feed back:
 FakeClown_557: hi
 YusufEmad04: come suck my dick mother fuckers
 YusufEmad04: red asses
 VizGhar: oO
 struct: VizGhar did you test the code yesterday?
 VizGhar: I've checked it&#160;:) Give me few minutes, i'll try to rewrite it
 VizGhar: my code without memoization took 6043ms to complete
 struct: in cpp?
 VizGhar: kotlin
 VizGhar:&#160;:)
 struct: and kotlin passes with that time?
 VizGhar: nope... I've sent you time without memoization
 VizGhar: with memoization its much faster
 VizGhar: I rewrote your solution to kotlin and it's still 4s
 struct: ah ok
 struct: I also have memoization solution I think
 VizGhar: so in java based languages probably memoization is necesity
 VizGhar: or maybe just list is slow.. sec
 VizGhar: 2.2s
 VizGhar: I'll try same in C
 struct: C++ cant do it
 struct: even with pragmas
 struct: takes longer than 500ms
 jrke: about what you are talking about?
 VizGhar: We are trying to solve Roller Coaster without memoization&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds ambitious
 eulerscheZahl: "Please solve this problem with an O(N) algorithm."<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-beautiful-sequence">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-beautiful-sequence</a>as a matter of principle I did it in O(nÂ³)
 struct: euler its possible
 struct: On some languages only
 struct: I think I told you long ago
 VizGhar: euler is talking about other puzzle :P
 struct: ah, I thought the ambitious part was for you
 eulerscheZahl: ambitious = roller coaster
 eulerscheZahl: then i got side tracked and talked about a puzzle where I decided to do something stupid
 VizGhar: ah ok then... well struct was successful I wasn't. kotlin, c, c++ can't do it :P
 struct: I think on js can
 struct: I didnt try other languages though
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 struct: Maybe they forgot to change js time on that puzzle
 struct: Timeout is higher than 6 sec
 jacek: or they think js is shit and needs some handicap
 reindeer: Hi everyone
 xXx_KILLER2018_xXx: hewo OwO
 zhoubou: VizGhar I did it in Python without memoization and it passed in less than a second.
 zhoubou: The core of my code is computing cycles. Hmm.. Maybe that is memoization? Idk
 VizGhar: yes it is :D
 Oursbrun: Does anyone know why I can't see the animation panel??
 VizGhar: what is animation panel?
 Oursbrun: it's solved, thanks anyway&#160;:)
 Kaleab: please no shortest
 jacek: oO

 Nixerrr: Hey everyone, it's been a while :scream_cat:
 MSmits: hi Nixerrr
 Nixerrr: Hi MS, nice to see you're still around&#160;:)
 MSmits: still kickin
 MSmits: are you just saying hi or do you want to try a multi or something?
 Nixerrr: Yeah, I want to get back in teh game
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: any idea which?
 Nixerrr: I've never have an honest try to optimization
 Nixerrr: *given
 MSmits: oh, plenty of fun ones out there
 Astrobytes: long time no see Nixerrr, welcome back&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah wb!
 Nixerrr: Thanks!
 Nixerrr: No sleep till legend, obviously :point_up_2:
 eulerscheZahl: hey Nixerrr. someone reported an issue with your cultist war game recently
 Nixerrr: Yeah, that's what prompted my return.
 eulerscheZahl: we should report bugs more often then
 Nixerrr: They've withdrawn their comment since then
 eulerscheZahl: when have you been here the last time? there must be something you've missed
 Nixerrr: I think I've missed a lot of things. I think I logged in sometime in the summer but I don't think I've been active this year at all
 eulerscheZahl: we have a quest map now, is that new to you?
 eulerscheZahl: go and solve the puzzle of the week, i've been told it's a nice one :P
 jacek: its monday isnt it
 Nixerrr: Why not&#160;:) Yeah I've seen the quest map
 eulerscheZahl: oh, right. it's no longer potw&#160;:(
 Nixerrr: I don't even know what language to use. It's been such a long time. Maybe I should start learning something new, like Rust
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/next-growing-number">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/next-growing-number</a>
 jacek: euler says its nice puzzle
 Nixerrr: Or maybe I should learn D :skull:
 eulerscheZahl: the troll character is taken by jacek already, try something else
 Nixerrr: What's your character, Euler?
 jacek: pepe the frog

 Westicles: praise kick
 eulerscheZahl: my role is obviously the one of AutomatonNN's lover
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is the best pathfinding to the teacher to be a police with the same code but it's a bi
 darkhorse64: Shared love, isn't that beautiful&#160;?
 jacek: AutomatonNN where is love in this
 AutomatonNN: at least i have to be so mad
 darkhorse64: 9 upvotes on my negative comment for Adding Coc: there is an uprising riot against goofy CoC
 jacek: hmm?
 Nixerrr: Adding CoC to what?
 darkhorse64: Adding is the name of the CoC
 Nixerrr: Ah ok, gotcha'
 darkhorse64: That was unclear
 struct: print(a*3+b*3) or something like that
 jacek: "I would suicide if i'd decide to play a CoC and get this problem&#160;:))"
 jacek: well there is one coc just to print the input
 jacek: though it is for shortest mode
 jacek: no one approved the blockout yet
 jacek: too many dimensions?
 eulerscheZahl: takes time to write a solution and review the game properly
 Astrobytes: I've not written anything for it yet
 Astrobytes: same for tric trac's game, and recurs e chess
 jacek: i mostly done chess. left is its castling ~
 Astrobytes: and jrk e's, and the fencing one
 eulerscheZahl: brilliant idea: create such a puzzle during twitch livestream. that might increase the review rate as you can partially do so while watching
 Astrobytes: jb m did live puzzle creation, the Goro want chocolate one iirc
 jacek: jbm? jrke? reCurse? trictrac? what's with the space, man
 eulerscheZahl: i'm talking about SDK contributions. probably more interesting to watch
 Astrobytes: ah
 eulerscheZahl: as it's still mostly, statement is a little aspect only
 eulerscheZahl: mostly coding*
 Astrobytes: jacek the pingmaster extraordinaire strikes again
 eulerscheZahl: contrib page is getting flooded, hard to find anything of interest&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/43687cd854d10e38c3716e6d08efe735b42f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/43687cd854d10e38c3716e6d08efe735b42f</a>
 jacek: they should filter out the cocs
 eulerscheZahl: 30 days passed, barely any comments
 struct: Well we can barely reject a puzzle
 struct: at least for coc
 eulerscheZahl: yes, hard to justify a rejection, even the one where darkhorse64 got the upvotes for the hostile comment
 eulerscheZahl: (which i upvoted too)
 Astrobytes: well, at least euler nominated himself for a live SDK coding session.
 eulerscheZahl: did i?
 Astrobytes: Not really but I'm going with it
 darkhorse64: hostile is a bit harsh. I just said it has little value
 eulerscheZahl: and now you deleted your comment?
 eulerscheZahl: or did i open the wrong one?
 Astrobytes: it's still there, I upvoted it a few minutes ago.
 eulerscheZahl: me too. now i dont see it anymore
 eulerscheZahl: lost in contributions
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/598558f1e0085229d3a426cf11dbf9a8a12f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/598558f1e0085229d3a426cf11dbf9a8a12f</a>
 eulerscheZahl: ok, bad click from my side
 darkhorse64: Confusing print(2*input()) with print(3*input()+3*input())&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Westicles: I offered to help him make a good one, but we had communication problems
 eulerscheZahl: you are on the other extreme regarding difficulty, so a coop could work :thinking:
 struct: 2*pi
 Westicles: The one I was going to use actually got approved... 
 jacek: and puzzle of the week is done \o/
 Westicles: Did it generate any real interest in 2048?  I didn't see much snake talk this week
 eulerscheZahl: old leaderboard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/a394e8e75f0145323f4ec424a23160ba7d52b9d1/optim/2048.tsv">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/a394e8e75f0145323f4ec424a23160ba7d52b9d1/optim/2048.tsv</a>
 jacek: push random bot, get potw quest [done]
 eulerscheZahl: so seems like Regulus with 22M points is the highest from the new wave
 jacek: was 130, now is 598
 eulerscheZahl: 598 as in 414
 eulerscheZahl: the 598 is those who kicked "play my code", not necessarily submitting
 eulerscheZahl: so almost 300 new players. but few of them who tried for more than a few minutes it seems
 eulerscheZahl: while the rating (stars) didn't change significantly
 jacek: right, forgot to 1-star it, as always
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if all of the 1 star reviews understood the game
 eulerscheZahl: and some haters are normal
 Westicles: Answer is up, 1 star hated it
 jacek: weird seeing fox being last
 jacek: how you can get not 100% o.O
 eulerscheZahl: crash
 Westicles: Start out hardcoding and get bored
 alenic: I did some improvement on 2048, I used sequential beam search with snake heuristic, I reached 15M for now&#160;! I  let go the hardcoding solution for now&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 alenic: But how can I reach 52M&#160;? :joy:
 jacek: well, its not random if you know the seed
 alenic: yes, I use the information seed also, maybe some problem on the beam search...
 jacek: woo new puzzle of the week
 jacek: finally over of the last one
 VizGhar: :tada:
 DJSchaffner: does anyone know if you can somehow perform something on a variable and check if the variable changed without using a temporary variable? (python3)
 DJSchaffner: by "something" i mean a calculation :D
 VizGhar: if you want to check whether something changed, you have to have some reference value to compare it with&#160;;) so you most probably need temp var
 DJSchaffner: i was counting on some weird contraption with the walrus operator or similar but unlucky :D
 VizGhar: idk what walrus operator is, but it sounds too heavy :D
 DJSchaffner: bascially something to assign a value to a variable while comparing it with a value
 DJSchaffner: if (a&#160;:= 2) &gt; 1: "this is always true"
 DJSchaffner: stuff like that
 DJSchaffner: ':=' being the walrus operator
 Toby75: A question to the puzzle of the week. I was having trouble with the last test case.
 Toby75: The test case says that the result for the last number (11123159995399999) should be 11123333333333333. But why?
 VizGhar: 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3
 Toby75: sure
 VizGhar: you timeouting?
 Toby75: The input is: 11123159995399999 And the output should be: 11123333333333333. Why not 11123359999999999
 SPDene: you have to find the smallest growing number greater than 11123159995399999 
 SPDene: 11123359999999999 isn't smaller than 11123333333333333
 Toby75: I see
 VizGhar: yup find smallest&#160;:) I haven't solved it yet, but paper should be your friend for this one
 Toby75: My code says that test cases 1 to 4 are correct, but somehow the last one crashes all lmao
 VizGhar: beauty of coding :D
 DJSchaffner: anyone here &lt; 200 characters in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor</a> with python?: D
 jacek: Toby75 you mean timeout?
 VizGhar: Or maybe he is trying to store it as a number&#160;:)
 Toby75: jacek yeah
 VizGhar: well... optimize then. Is there something valuable for you in forum?
 Toby75: I dont think so
 jacek: use your brain
 Toby75: I used it lmao
 Toby75: it is trash
 VizGhar: wow :D so help us to help you... how'd you implemented it?
 Toby75: well my first suggestion was checking every number... what is obviously stupid and slow
 Toby75: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/TfbZUJjF">https://pastebin.com/TfbZUJjF</a> then I thought it would work somehow like this...
 jacek: is you have number 12313243.... then the next one is 12333333...
 jacek: check out the first digit which is smaller than previous digit
 VizGhar: yup... key is to find first smaller digit then required in sequence
 VizGhar: + edge cases (ending with 9)
 Toby75: I got it
 Toby75: thanks to your help
 Toby75: It was kinda frustrating because I suck at maths
 Westicles: 'maths'.  that is never gonna stop sounding weird
 Toby75: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 jacek: math, not even once
 Soniro: hello micka
 andrecab: hi, can someone tell me if it is possible to read the content of a file in some url or my pc to the codingame IDE?
 AntiSquid: no
 therealbeef: isn't it?
 therealbeef: sounds like the sync feature
 struct: it is possible with an extension
 struct: by file you mean a file with code right?
 andrecab: not code but some values of a Q table for example
 struct: then no
 jacek: youd have to hardcode it into code
 Alanj-Jones: Hi
 andrecab: ok, that makes training outside of the IDE impossible i guess
 andrecab: thanks for the response!
 struct: no, some people managed to do it
 struct: they just store it in the code
 jacek: how big is your q table? the code can have 100k characters
 andrecab: around 3million floats so even more chars
 jacek: oh
 andrecab: i'll use that on my pc for fun and maybe if I can reduce the size enough i'll hardcode it to the IDE
 therealbeef: you can still use it to 'test' your other solutions against, especially in mutliplayer
 struct: Here is an article of someone who did it for CSB <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article</a>
 andrecab: very nice! thank you
 ReversableCode: Does anyone know the test case behind the validator 1 regarding the puzzle of the week? 
 ReversableCode: a similar test case would be appreciated
 struct: 0&gt;number&lt;10
 struct: is in that range
 ReversableCode: Thank you

 Metanoob: nice I see it's about graphs, haven't tried it yet. How do you find it so far?
 AI_says_hi: I have an idea how to solve it but I doubt it's a very smart one ^^
 Metanoob: haha good luck and mostly have fun&#160;:)
 AI_says_hi: thanks&#160;:)
 AI_says_hi: u too with whatever puzzle

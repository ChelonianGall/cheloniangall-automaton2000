 SuryaTheOP: hloo
 SuryaTheOP: can any one help me in chuck Norris
 SuryaTheOP: i passed all test cases expect last
 SuryaTheOP: i don't know what happening  in last case
 juice0: the one that wants you to output 0's?
 SuryaTheOP: yes
 juice0: let's see, what is happening? one sec
 SuryaTheOP: okay
 sprkrd: give him one sec, he's hacking into your account to check your code
 SuryaTheOP: :joy:
 juice0: hey shh
 sprkrd: :upside_down:
 SuryaTheOP: accidently i closed your chat. please send me your msg again @juice0
 juice0: oh i just wanted you to send me your output for that test case
 juice0: i can't see immediately what would be tripping you up if you got 1-3 right
 SuryaTheOP: i still don't get it

 c0nc4c: the medium puzzle is so hard
 derjack: medium puzzle?
 derjack: the one with chess?
 c0nc4c: the there is no spoon one
 derjack: oh
 JorBer: its not too hard
 woful: w*men🤮
 derjack: oO
 woful: fr*nch:zzz:
 JorBer: the troll is back
 altayayayay: :grimacing:
 derjack: which troll
 JorBer: woful
 woful: ye?
 woful: aahh sorry mate, finger must have slipped whilst writing code
 altayayayay: happens to the best of us...
 woful: agreed...
 JorBer: such a nice friendly profile
 altayayayay: i just realised that. wtf
 JorBer: he changed it now
 woful: yo
 woful: wtf
 woful: my finger slipped

 Marchete: I always lose :S
 Astrobytes: It would appear so judging by his score
 Astrobytes: 1-0 to me Marchete. Try closing your eyes :D
 Astrobytes: damn, 5-4 to machine
 derjack: you act so deterministically
 Astrobytes: Oddly enough :P
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: hey struct
 Astrobytes: Old John also submitting in Oware
 derjack: but its uNNlikely
 derjack: struct made any breakthrough in your bt bot?
 struct: so its 7 NNs in top 10?
 struct: dont think so derjack
 struct: I was reading a paper about tablebases for breakthrough
 Astrobytes: yeah 7 I think
 struct: and in 8x8 breakthrough tablebases seem to make the bot wors
 struct: worse*
 derjack: oh really
 struct: They were using row tablebases 
 struct: yes
 derjack: would they be too big?
 struct: yes
 struct: Because they were doing row tablebases
 struct: not pieces 
 derjack: i just have some ifs for endgames
 struct: yeah I still need to figure end games
 struct: its easy has a human to solve most of them
 TipuTare: hey guys
 derjack: good afernoon
 TipuTare: guys
 TipuTare: how do i use the datetime function in the datetime module

 ChickenCoder123: hallo guys
 InternalErrror: Also @TipuTare: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nohello.com/">https://www.nohello.com/</a> 
 sprkrd: @InternalErrror Come on, don't be harsh on the guy, this is not a technical support chat :joy:
 sprkrd: Then you should probably tell struct off because he just said hi without any immediate question
 sprkrd: I think it's ok to come in and just say hi, who knows, maybe someone was looking for you&#160;;)
 ChickenCoder123: lmao sorry guys
 Wontonimo: hi :wave:

 sprkrd: why dodging me? D:
 sprkrd: I was the one supporting the friendly "hi"
 sprkrd: I think I've been misunderstood&#160;:(
 <b>**sprkrd goes to cry in the corner</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: :taco: of friendship
 sprkrd: :relieved:
 Wontonimo: yeah, I tried to be witty before fully reading your msg
 Wontonimo: are you working on any multis sprk?
 sprkrd: not right now, no, I'm just procrastinating a little bit while I should be doing the real-life work
 sprkrd: I'm already happy enough with my C4 bot and I don't think I want to push it further for the moment
 sprkrd: I don't think I have the dedication of the top 6 runners to invest more time on that and match their gigantic number of rollouts
 sprkrd: what about you, Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: Nothing.  Jumping on the NN wagon is on my list.  The last multi I worked on was just to play with Tron using flood fill.
 Wontonimo: the NN wagon seems like a nice change from just applying MCTS to everything
 RoboStac: it's just applying mcts to everything with some extra heat output though
 sprkrd: well... depending on what type of RL you do, you'll be doing MCTS also with NNs
 sprkrd: unless you use actor critic and parameterize the policy directly, without any look-ahead at all
 Wontonimo: yeah, for sure.  But there are not twists to it
 Wontonimo: *new twists
 sprkrd: RoboStac When you do you NN stuff, do go by the alphazero route or the alphastar route?
 RoboStac: alphazero
 sprkrd: hmph
 Wontonimo: what's the salient difference?
 Jaw_7227: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://binarysearch.com/room/Bits-N-Bytes-xkUOOpDHju">https://binarysearch.com/room/Bits-N-Bytes-xkUOOpDHju</a>
 Jaw_7227: any one wanna join?
 RoboStac: alphastar didn't have any sort of mcts, just a massive network that outputs moves
 sprkrd: Wontonimo in alphastar they don't do any look-ahead
 sprkrd: it's actor critic, the policy is encoded directly in its own function approximator
 Wontonimo: that's a significant difference.  Works for some things
 sprkrd: i mean, if it works for starcraft, given enough computer resources it may as well work for anything else
 sprkrd: however the amount of CPU/GPU hours that went into that shrinks my heart
 struct: had no idea there was a builtin function to rotate a bitboard 
 Wontonimo: what function is that?
 struct: __builtin_bswap64
 Wontonimo: neato!
 Wontonimo: that's actually really cool
 sprkrd: I highly appreciate that random piece of information
 sprkrd: I'm sure it'll come handy at some point
 struct: Using the x86-64 _byteswap_uint64 or bswap64 intrinsics only takes one processor instruction in 64-bit mode.
 struct: I might try it instead of having a if for each player
 sprkrd: but, if I understand correctly the description, that doesn't rotate the bitboard, it reverses the order of the bytes... so it would be more like a flip?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/index.php?title=Flipping_Mirroring_and_Rotating#FlipVertically">https://www.chessprogramming.org/index.php?title=Flipping_Mirroring_and_Rotating#FlipVertically</a>
 struct: Should do this
 sprkrd: yup, flipping
 sprkrd: is that what you want? or you want actual rotation?
 struct: I think this is what I want
 sprkrd: breakthrough?
 struct: yes
 sprkrd: you've had a breakthrough in your breakthrough
 sprkrd: anyway, thanks, it's nice to know this
 sprkrd: i feel so dirty using builtin compiler instructions tho
 struct: why?
 jacek: huh
 sprkrd: platform dependant
 sprkrd: and compiler dependant
 sprkrd: i feel like I've given my dignity away just to squeeze every last drop of performance of a computer.
 jacek: dont we all
 struct: not really
 struct: never felt like that
 Wontonimo: what?  no no, don't feel like that sprk!
 Wontonimo: that's what high performance computing is all about, programming to the hardward
 sprkrd: guys, chill, I don't need therapy, I was just kidding :joy:
 sprkrd: You're all so serious
 sprkrd: jacek is the only one who understands me&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i've lost my sense of humour
 Wontonimo: i haven't even told a good dad joke at home for a week
 sprkrd: I was referencing the fact that, by making your code so platform-specific for the sake of performance, you give readability away and are more in touch with the machine than with your own human nature
 sprkrd: but that being said, I'm a sucker for bit tricks :D
 struct: too deep for me
 sprkrd: Wontonimo never too late, you can start today ^^
 Wontonimo: I thought you were going to say something along the lines of"are any dad jokes good?"
 Saint_Rose: The comeback is always greater than the setback. 
 struct: its time to scratch my code and start again I guess
 struct: im back in the rewriting loop&#160;:(
 sprkrd: Wontonimo I'm a big fan of dad jokes myself
 Wontonimo: wow struct, you have more motivation than I do
 sprkrd: he is motivated by revenge
 struct: I did not had much code anyways
 Saint_Rose: I have a vengeance to prove all those who doubted me wrong. 
 struct: o.o
 Saint_Rose: We should all be the best coders we can be. 
 jacek: oh my
 SpacePrez: the discussion UI on this site is pretty hard to use
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: How can you tell if you're a Deadhead? - You studied 5 days for a drug test :P
 Wontonimo: nice!
 Wontonimo: I've heard a variant of that"yo mama so dumb she practice for her drug test by doing all the drugs"
 SpacePrez: how do you post a message on a discussion? I have no submit button
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I've heard a few, just heard that one yesterday
 SpacePrez: pressing enter just adds a newline
 Wontonimo: i remember having a boomer moment looking for the submit button also SpacePrez.  It's there
 Astrobytes: Underneath
 sprkrd: SpacePrez yes, it's a known bug
 sprkrd: It happens to me sometimes in Firefox
 SpacePrez: how do I get underneath?
 sprkrd: you cannot see the reply buttons
 SpacePrez: I can click to reply and it opens a window to type a response
 SpacePrez: but I cannot submit the response
 sprkrd: well, yeah, the *submit button, if you will
 SpacePrez: no I cannot see any submit button
 Astrobytes: Any extensions running? 
 SpacePrez: adblock is paused on this site
 sprkrd: I... I'm telling you exactly that, you cannot see the submit button, is a known bug
 SpacePrez: I already know that, I just said it lol. Just say 'its a bug'.
 Astrobytes: Never happened to me even once
 SpacePrez: yeah well javascript isn't the most stable :P
 sprkrd: I don't know if there's some shortcut to submit your reply
 sprkrd: maybe ctrl+enter or something like that
 bosniancode: there is something worse than an invisible submit button
 sprkrd: Astrobytes it's in the discord, in the bugs&amp;feedback channel (I myself submitted an screenshot)
 Astrobytes: I see it, gotcha. 'Sometimes', how exceedingly annoying!
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/699972160688488468/856567875372580934">https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/699972160688488468/856567875372580934</a>
 struct: save the servers
 sprkrd: SpacePrez try key combinations like ctrl+enter, shift+enter and whatnot, if that doesn't work you can either fiddle with the web inspector or you can try to restart the browser, erase the cache, the usual stuff
 SpacePrez: thanks
 sprkrd: I think I reported this same error years ago
 Astrobytes: Pray, cross your fingers, toss a coin, rub a lamp, that kinda stuff :D
 sprkrd: So I wouldn't count on it being fixed anytime soon. Probably it's hard to reproduce
 Astrobytes: Yeah. 'sometimes' bugs are the worst.
 sprkrd: Astrobytes I'll add the "rub a lamp" to my repertoire, that one was missing
 Astrobytes: Low priority because it doesn't happen to everyone, hard to fix because hard to reproduce etc
 Astrobytes: lol sprkrd 
 sprkrd: SpacePrez While you're at it, could you tell us if ctrl + enter works? I don't want to post a message just to try it
 sprkrd: Oh well, I guess I can post it and delete it just after
 sprkrd: For the general interest of the audience gathered here, yes, Ctrl+Enter works. Should more clicky methods be out of reach, know that the ways of the keyboard provide us with an alternative
 sprkrd: Also, I've just posted a "sup my boys" to a random forum thread
 SpacePrez: sorry I already started a clash
 Astrobytes: Nice one sprkrd, useful info
 SpacePrez: yes ctrl+enter works for me (but no indication, some text or a button would be nice!)
 sprkrd: May the gods listen to your prayers
 TipuTare: hey
 TipuTare: can someone help me with a code?
 TipuTare: nvm
 TipuTare: actually can someone help me with it?
 TipuTare: pls
 struct: whats the problem?
 sprkrd: A tip for efficiency: it's just better if you throw your question in the chat in the first place
 SpacePrez: &gt;Now, the teacher gives you x numbers n (x is odd)
 SpacePrez: why not just say N numbers?
 SpacePrez: &gt;Furthermore, he wants you to add the square of the middle number to the result.
 SpacePrez: what is a middle number? the median?
 SpacePrez: Some of these tests are great and some are really poorly worded.
 riprobertmugabe: thats not confusing
 riprobertmugabe: N is the number you receive, x is the amount of numbers you receive

 <b>**Wontonimo sighs knowing it won't work</b></p><p><img src="/a/3876179544657" /> sprkrd: You should probably hack into their account and leave a message in the "about" section of their profile

 sprkrd: man, my Italian sucks
 Wontonimo: way better than mine
 Wontonimo: I bet your Italian is better than my Mandarin 
 sprkrd: If you speak french you can make a wild guess
 sprkrd: for an italian sentence, i mean
 sprkrd: Are you french-canadian?
 Wontonimo: English.  I'm supposed to know French, like all good Canadians
 Wontonimo: but, it's very very shaky.  Like probably a listening vocab of 2000 words and a working vocab of 200
 sprkrd: well, I've been to quebec and montreal, and lots of people don't speak english there, so don't feel bad
 sprkrd: for not knowing the two languages, i mean
 Wontonimo: I wouldn't feel bad at all.  Actually, it makes me happy to hear that they have the option to live and do well with just their native language
 sprkrd: never been to toronto, tho
 Wontonimo: oh, that's another language yet
 Wontonimo: it's similar to English
 sprkrd: :joy:
 sprkrd: then you haven't been to quebec?
 sprkrd: on holidays or something?
 Wontonimo: I have.  It is only a couple hours drive away.  In the winter there is a really cool winter festival there 
 Wontonimo: that i've taken my kids to
 Wontonimo: where they have ice slides, and ice hotels
 Wontonimo: in the summer i've also gone and really enjoyed the restaurants and sights.
 Wontonimo: and I practice my 200 words
 sprkrd: i really liked the city, and there was one of the best restaurants I've been to in Canada. We order "moules" and they brought the entire bucket of moules, i wasn't expecting that at all
 Wontonimo: What brought you over the Atlantic all the way to Quebec?
 sprkrd: To Montreal originally, and then I stayed a little bit more for vacations and went also to Quebec
 sprkrd: It was because of a conference
 sprkrd: ICRA, maybe you've heard of it, if you're into robotics
 sprkrd: I had to present a paper there
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.icra2019.org/">https://www.icra2019.org/</a>
 sprkrd: it was my very first time accross the atlantic. It was very nice&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: def heard of IEEE. What paper did you present?
 sprkrd: At first I had a little bit of a clash with the tip mechanism, because in Europe is entirely different. But I quickly learned how it was done
 sprkrd: it was...
 sprkrd: damn, i don't remember the title of my paper

 KiwiTae: have u met my bot yet? wait for a push hehe
 Astrobytes: Still in silver, doing a rewrite&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: mine is in silver.  only did a flood fill so far.  no look ahead

 jacek: did he also make dad jokes
 MSmits: he made a video about some contest prize for his students and at the end there was this "important  message"

 MSmits: pretty elaborate rickroll
 MSmits: jacek he does that :P
 MSmits: I just spent 2 days hunting a bug in my D&amp;B solver... finally found it. It happened like 1 out of 200 times

 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes, what are you gonna use for Tron?
 Astrobytes: I was thinking an alphabeta on the nearest enemy
 Astrobytes: MCTS might work too, EPT
 Wontonimo: I was thinking beam using my flood full
 Wontonimo: *fill
 Astrobytes: Interesting idea
 Wontonimo: let me double check that I didn't have anything more than just floodfill that would complicate things

 Astrobytes: I was following on from 'sup'
 sprkrd: oh, then i'm afraid I don't follow
 Wontonimo: no, you lead
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes follows
 sprkrd: my street jargon is not that advanced
 Astrobytes: "supper's ready" just a statement
 sprkrd: Wontonimo i iron
 Astrobytes: (Also a great song from Foxtrot by Genesis - Peter Gabriel days)
 Astrobytes: prog-tastic
 sprkrd: oh, good to know, didn't know per stands for supper
 sprkrd: :relieved:
 Astrobytes: sup + per's ready
 sprkrd: lately the chat's been very musical
 Astrobytes: usually is if I'm around, apologies for that
 sprkrd: no need to apologize :joy:
 Astrobytes: I try to minimise the music talk but can't help it sometimes
 sprkrd: this is not a technical support chat, it's ok to talk about other things , i believe :relieved:
 Astrobytes: It is. Within reason&#160;;)
 sprkrd: of course, within reason. I guess porn is out of the picture
 Astrobytes: Yes, lol
 Wontonimo: does code gulf count as code porn?
 sprkrd: code golf counts as the worst human behavior imaginable
 Astrobytes: that's like bad pr0n
 sprkrd: like, mengele's experiments type of stuff 
 Wontonimo: i think we need a change of topic
 Astrobytes: code gulf or golf? There are gulfs in some of my code for sure
 Astrobytes: I agree
 Wontonimo: that was a weird typo... i wonder why i typed gulf&#160;?
 Wontonimo: brain, dude.  it's wild
 sprkrd: I think is a Freudian slip 
 Wontonimo: "Freudian slips", isn't that what women psychologist wear under there dresses
 Wontonimo: a fashion and psychology joke in one
 Astrobytes: It's gulf-∨ syndrome 
 Astrobytes: that one's a little bit subtle
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: jeeeeeeeez making up for the lack of dad jokes eh!
 Wontonimo: you'd have to know about dresses
 sprkrd: Astrobytes that one went way over my head
 Astrobytes: Subtlety I was referring to Gulf-∨
 Astrobytes: Gulf ∨ Golf (that's ¬'v')
 sprkrd: what does a a long-range, large business jet aircraft produced by Gulfstream Aerospace have to do with anything? :thinking:
 sprkrd: (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulfstream_V">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulfstream_V</a>)
 Astrobytes: Think logically
 Astrobytes: Gulf OR golfGulf-OR SyndromeGulf War Syndrome
 Astrobytes: Too far out?
 sprkrd: oh god, so I guess it has to do with how "or" and "war" sound alike, then?
 Astrobytes: Pretty much
 sprkrd: here i was manipulating the ascii representation of golf and gulf to see the connection
 Astrobytes: The secret is not to overthink it in most problems&#160;;)
 sprkrd: applying de morgan's and everything
 Astrobytes: no need to get that deep :D
 Astrobytes: Anyway, just a bit of fun
 sprkrd: pronunciation is not my strength&#160;:(
 sprkrd: probably i pronounce "or" and "war" a bit like how you would read them in spanish
 Astrobytes: ah, sorry. In Scotland 'or' is identical to the 'ar' in 'war'
 sprkrd: well, maybe not that bad, but it's definitively no native's pronunciation :joy:
 Astrobytes: or, war, nor, for etc
 sprkrd: ah, scotland, i've yet to go there on holidays or something
 sprkrd: to be honest, is one of the accents i hear the less in my surroundings
 MACKEYTH: Those rhyme in US English, too
 Astrobytes: Go to Edinburgh once to see the castle etc, do Stirling to see the castle and Wallace monument, then go highlands and western isles.
 sprkrd: of course, Edinburgh was going to be my first stop&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: And English-English I believe MACKEYTH but it varies with dialect
 sprkrd: the more i think about it, the more clever I find the Gulf-v pun  :thinking:
 Astrobytes: lol, I'm quite well known irl for my puns
 Astrobytes: Also sprkrd, do we call you Guillem or Alejandro? :P
 sprkrd: Carme, please
 MSmits: Gollem?

 MSmits: sry been on a hobbit spree 
 sprkrd: MSmits but now that you mention, probably I should write his name like that in the next paper to see if he notices
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: that would be so funny
 MSmits: especially if he doesn't and it gets accepted
 Astrobytes: I knew it would be one of the two, papers vary with the order regarding presenting author
 sprkrd: :relieved:
 sprkrd: Now you now my real name, I feel fragile
 MSmits: well you kinda know mine
 Astrobytes: At first I thought since you presented in Canada it was a 'Guillaume' so you would be Alejandro, but then it's also available in other country flavours :D
 Astrobytes: Michelle's Bits
 sprkrd: MSmits I'll be real honest with you, for me it's impossible to read your name and not think "Mr. Smith"
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: both of those are fine
 Zenoscave: I always think ms. mits
 sprkrd: and then scenes from The Matrix pop up
 Astrobytes: sprkrd: My name is Chris Laing
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: It's not a secret. You can find it on RAIC for a start
 MSmits: laing? never heard that surname before
 sprkrd: Astrobytes Guillem is actually a Catalan name (northeast of Spain)
 Astrobytes: I get mistaken for Lang, Liang, Ling and all sorts of other ones
 sprkrd: pleased to meet you, Mr. Laing :relieved:
 MSmits: those are all asian though
 Astrobytes: Lang isn't
 Zenoscave: lange
 MSmits: hmm isn it?
 Zenoscave: it can be but has a eurocentric descent as well
 MSmits: ah yes it has multiple origin
 MSmits: s
 Astrobytes: Well, it might be. But 1. I am not asian 2. I'm a Laing dammit (rhymes with brain + a g at the end)
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/profile/Astrobytes">https://russianaicup.ru/profile/Astrobytes</a>
 Zenoscave: i'm a smith
 Astrobytes: Luke, I am your father
 Zenoscave: lol
 MSmits: no it must be me, i am also a smith
 MSmits: sort of
 MSmits: if you squint
 Zenoscave: I squint a lot. hence the glasses
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: you got that from me
 Astrobytes: sprkrd: Catalan, cool! Yeah, Guillaume is the French version&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I have glasses too, but not for a squint
 MSmits: you mean you have them for beer?
 sprkrd: MSmits I must add, I also picture you as an elderly man with moustache
 Zenoscave: I wonder why
 Astrobytes: Now. Witness the powah of this FULLY OPERATIONAL BATTLESTA- oh, wait
 MSmits: sprkrd that's my inner self
 sprkrd: your avatar has had a strong influence as how I imagine the real you
 Zenoscave: Really with the star wars jokes
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: I'm a megaman then
 Zenoscave: pewpewpew
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aicups.ru/profile/1289/">https://aicups.ru/profile/1289/</a>
 MSmits: one of my favorites growing up. We used to rent games and I rented megaman a lot
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we all get exposed on RAIC YurkovAS :D
 Zenoscave: Willy's stage had the best theme song
 sprkrd: YurkovAS the stalking is strong on this one :grimacing:
 MSmits: dont remember the song
 MSmits: I just liked all the different weapons you got when beating levels
 Astrobytes: Glory days of gaming eh&#160;:)
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: should we get re curse if we're going to talk about gaming nostalgia
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJRoRt155mA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJRoRt155mA</a>
 Astrobytes: don't think he's in chat
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: haha yes!
 sprkrd: which is strange, I though he was 24/7
 sprkrd: at least his computer
 Astrobytes: re curse has other priorities currently&#160;:)
 MSmits: whats he doing
 Astrobytes: Presumably preparing?
 MSmits: for?
 Wontonimo: we are allowed to have other priorities?
 MSmits: news to me Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: Little re Curse!
 sprkrd: sure thing, but I liked to think that even when stuff is going on in his life, he's computer is permanently on with the CG page loaded up
 MSmits: oh right
 sprkrd: his computer*
 MSmits: it might be
 MSmits: also some people now reading chat are going to think he named his computer little re curse
 Astrobytes: Good!
 Astrobytes: I'm sure he'll appreciate that one :D
 MSmits: hehe yea
 sprkrd: and what a cute name for such a cute thing that is
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: Anyways, I'm out for this evening. Take care everybody, see ya tomorrow
 sprkrd: bon soir, my gold nugget
 TimeTransfixed: question: is there a way to go back to a clash of code playground after the end of the contest?
 sprkrd: bonsoir*
 sprkrd: TimeTransfixed I believe there is, if you haven't deleted the notification
 sprkrd: you know, the notification you get when the clash finishes
 sprkrd: you can click on that and go back to the page with the ranking
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Search for it here otherwise:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Astrobytes: And with that, I fully bid you goodnight
 struct: gn
 sprkrd: gn!
 sprkrd: i'll be out soon myself too
 MSmits: I cant go to bed&#160;:(
 sprkrd: how come?
 struct: ill be out once i finish bt
 MSmits: believe it or not, i need to do a work thing at 1:15 am =/
 MSmits: cant do it sooner
 sprkrd: I... wow
 MSmits: a database dump happens at that moment
 sprkrd: I thought you were a teacher?
 sprkrd: You also take care of some database?
 MSmits: well i use the data from it
 MSmits: to make lists of student grades
 MSmits: for a meeting between teachers to decided what to do with the students at the end of the year
 MSmits: a lot of things change still, so i cant have 1+ day old data
 sprkrd: then I hope you can finish than soon :O
 MSmits: i do this for the whole school
 sprkrd: no hope of sleep for tonight?
 MSmits: so it's just me staying up
 MSmits: it's a short task
 MSmits: takes 15 mins
 MSmits: but i have to get up at 7 so it's annoying
 sprkrd: good then, all-nioghters are the worst
 MSmits: yeah i would not do that for sure
 MSmits: not for work that is
 MSmits: hey sprkrd what are you working on for CG?
 sprkrd: like right now? I was considering some ideas for Amazons
 MSmits: amazons seems cool
 MSmits: doesnt fit my usual MO
 MSmits: but that's ok
 sprkrd: I decided to leave C4 in stand-by
 sprkrd: I cannot match the gigantic number of rollouts that you monsters do
 MSmits: C4 doesnt have a long shelf life
 MSmits: not a lot of depth in that game imho
 struct: c4 is hard to improve after a certain point
 MSmits: sprkrd if you like a mathematical challenge try D&amp;B, it's definitely not about the rollouts
 MSmits: (dots and boxes)
 sprkrd: thank you, I was going to ask :joy:
 ridafkih: How do we ask to get questions removed?
 sprkrd: I'll definitively try it
 MSmits: it's a rabbit hole
 ridafkih: This description is .... definitely Google translated from a foreign language
 ridafkih: Makes 0 sense
 MSmits: ridafkih i have no idea what you are talking about
 ridafkih: You are given a string you need to print "no" and count of either COWS or MILK if COWS and MILK (as a word) appear same number of times in string , otherwise print count of COWS and MILK respectively. String contains words with uppercase letters and spaces separate each word.
 MSmits: i know bulls and cows, never done the milk and cows
 ridafkih: Yes
 sprkrd: ah, bulls and cows was a cool one ^^
 MSmits: do you mean the clash is bad?
 MSmits: ridafkih?
 ridafkih: The description is horribl
 sprkrd: ridafkih you can always fill the form at the end, and grade the problem statement with 1 star
 MSmits: the easiest way to fix it is to have someone with enough clashes done, change the description
 MSmits: but yeah rating it low helps too
 sprkrd: ah yeah, i didn't remember that was a thing
 struct: i dont think flipping the board was worth it&#160;:/
 sprkrd: (changing the problem description unilaterally)
 MSmits: did you flip the C4 board?
 MSmits: why would you do that?
 struct: no
 struct: breakthrough
 MSmits: oh
 sprkrd: to let the chips fall, obviously
 MSmits: well I flipped it only because i needed to use a lookup arra
 sprkrd: right out of the bitboard
 MSmits: and i didnt want to make the array twice as big
 sprkrd: out they go
 struct: lookup for what?
 MSmits: for finished games
 MSmits: if a piece is moved on to one of the last 4 rows
 MSmits: i do a lookup
 MSmits: to see if it can move to the end unimpeded
 struct: so you have row lookup? for each cells above row 4?
 MSmits: yeah i do a pext to lookup the occupancy of all the squares in front of it in triangle format
 MSmits: so the possible opponent pieces that can impede it
 struct: I need to figure how to do it
 MSmits: well you could, but i never saw much evidence of it helping
 struct: I was thinking on tablebases, but its not worth it
 struct: from what i Read
 MSmits: could be a huge waste of effort
 struct: I saw them trying 4 row tablebase
 struct: and it was worse than no tablebase
 MSmits: who is them?
 MSmits: is that the paper about racing?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://scholarworks.csun.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.3/174085/Isaac-Andrew-thesis-2016.pdf">https://scholarworks.csun.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.3/174085/Isaac-Andrew-thesis-2016.pdf</a>
 sprkrd: i'm going to feed the cats and then to sleep. Good night all. Good luck with breakthrough
 struct: gn
 MSmits: gn sprkrd
 struct: on 6x6 breakthrough it was a massive gain but they had 5 row tablebase
 struct: so almost entire board
 MSmits: struct, thats kinda different from what i do, but i think they are both somewhat useless
 MSmits: if i were to go back to breakthrough i'd just do a NN fo rit
 struct: yeah, from what I saw in a video the game is pretty much decided before the pieces reach those cells
 struct: or something like that
 MSmits: the way i would guess it should be obvious that it helps is if i solve the game sooner
 MSmits: but adding it didnt help me solve sooner
 struct: why not?
 MSmits: well i dont know, it just didnt
 MSmits: maybe it's just rare 
 MSmits: that a lookup helps
 struct: also it seems that black has advantage in this game
 MSmits: most lookups probably give a non-win as result
 MSmits: black moves first?
 struct: black is 2nd
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: how would you knoe?
 MSmits: is it that way for smaller boards?
 MSmits: if you compare for hexapawn and octapawn, hexapawn is solved for black, octapawn for white
 MSmits: (this game is very similar to BT)
 struct: on 6x6 they almost sovled it for white
 MSmits: also sometimes a game can feel like one side has a big advantage but when you search deeper, it ends up being solved for the other side
 struct: dont know why 8x8 is that much different
 MSmits: maybe there's a table somewhere, like the one for c4
 MSmits: with solved results for different sizes
 struct: 5x5 is solved for black
 struct: I think my 8x8 thing was wrong
 MSmits: your thing?
 struct: he just mentions that many positions end up be zugzwang so player 2 ends up winning
 struct: my 8x8 comment
 MSmits: sure but it matters a lot which player enters the zugzwang position
 MSmits: D&amp;B is exactly like that
 MSmits: and the sizes have different results
 MSmits: sometimes p1 is solved win, sometimes p2
 struct: on rollout do you check for zugzwang?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: my bot is bad
 struct: instead of stopping on depth N you could keep going
 struct: I noticed that stockfish if I limited it to depth 1 it would still search depth 5 sometimes
 struct: I guess its due to something on the search
 MSmits: sure, but i dont think i really get into zugzwang positions, my bot is not good enough for that
 MSmits: struct thats called quiescence search
 MSmits: you keep searching until you hit a "quiet" position
 MSmits: in checkers you would do this until you hit a non-jump position
 struct: ah
 MSmits: kinda cool you noticed this 
 struct: I guess maybe that was it
 MSmits: I think so yes
 MSmits: it's typical for minimax implementations and thats what stockfish is
 struct: when you flip the board do you use the builtin function?
 struct: there is one to flip vertically
 MSmits: no, i do some weird :poop: let me find one
 struct: i  found out today thats why im asking
 struct: __builtin_bswap64
 struct: _byteswap_uint64 in msvc
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/71b5e9d6-d865-45c1-a041-b314521041d6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/71b5e9d6-d865-45c1-a041-b314521041d6</a>
 struct: that only flips vertically
 struct: not vertical + diagonal
 struct: the builtin i mean
 MSmits: that flips every bit
 MSmits: i mean reverses
 MSmits: 64th bit becomes 1st
 MSmits: 63th bit becomes 2nd etc.
 MSmits: it's like you got up form your seat and sat down at the other side of the board
 MSmits: and look at it from that direction
 struct: yeah seems right
 MSmits: i didnt find a builtin for that
 struct: yeah seems that there is only vertical builtin
 MSmits: yeah that doesnt help me
 MSmits: i think its not bad though
 MSmits: i did this 1 time per expansion
 MSmits: not a bottleneck
 MSmits: generating all the nodes and such and doing the eval for each adds up to a lot more calc time
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: but as the lookup table didnt help, it was mostly wasted effort
 MSmits: good practice i guess
 struct: maybe i need to start simple
 MSmits: always a good idea
 MSmits: and one of the pieces of advice I don't follow myself :P
 struct: have you check domiko contribution?
 struct: might be an hard game too
 MSmits: nope

 MSmits: yeah found it&#160;:)
 MSmits: i remember looking at this game at some point
 IliesBourouh: hello coding community ❤is there a way to change difficulty in private clash seasons or to choose statements&#160;? 
 WhaIe: @IliesBourough unfortunately no, you can only select the game modes allowed (fastest, shortest, reverse), no way to change the difficulty or pick specific problems

 TimeTransfixed: Has anyone looked at this problem recently? My input stream does not match the suggested test case input stream. Gonna check to see if it's a problem with C now
 TimeTransfixed: seems to be an issue with C
 TimeTransfixed: ah the inputs are characters
 TimeTransfixed: not integers
 Wontonimo: Do not try and eat the taco, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth... there will be no taco. Then you will see it is not the taco that is eaten, it is only yourself feeling satisfied that the taco no longer exists

 kitty_2310: just curious, does this site just have games to practise languages you already have some experience in or can I pick up a new language from here alone?
 BlaiseEbuth: You can try. But the site is more for practice
 Benana: I've been coding for a while but everytime i come to this site and try do some practice, I always find it incredibly hard to get to grasps with. Is that just me or is there something I'm missing before I should jump into the puzzles?
 BlaiseEbuth: What have you tried&#160;?
 Wontonimo: kitty_2310, i learnt c++ here
 Wontonimo: it can be done
 kitty_2310: ok, thanks
 Benana: The Descent, the intro one, the pod racing game.
 Wontonimo: I can DM you about the pod racing
 Wontonimo: and see what clicks
 Benana: Like so far i've taught myself c# over like 6 or so years via Unity and learn java in college so I know I can do it
 Wontonimo: there is a lot of reading on this site
 Wontonimo: with a lot of details about the challenges and puzzles
 Wontonimo: Have fun Benana
 Wontonimo: ng all

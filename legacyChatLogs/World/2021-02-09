 hieupm123: hello
 EpicCoder3: Hello
 AntiSquid: good morning
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: hii AntiSquid new Avatar nice 
 delta-X: morning&#160;: p
 delta-X: where i can learn ascii art&#160;:(
 synchoz: guten morgen
 AntiSquid: #de
 jacek: #schmetterling
 Uljahn: #konnichiwassup
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: hii UIjahn or jacek
 MSmits: why not both?
 MSmits: seems like a logic error
 karliso: (true || true) == (true &amp;&amp; true)
 MSmits: good point
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: nice point
 AntiSquid: rationed greetings MSmits :joy:
 MissingScore: join
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MissingScore: Any quick way to join the room of a clash lobby if you left it? I'm on the results page now.
 AntiSquid:  /join #room_name
 MissingScore: Cool... and how do I know the room name of a specific game?
 MSmits: make it up, but it will be empty
 MSmits: Go to #TronMastery
 MSmits: or #UTTTastic
 AntiSquid: #freeCandies
 C_breeze: odd getting own clash to do
 Luuuuuuci: hello my friends
 Wow_Uhm: hi
 DylanD: olla
 dericeketli: hello
 dericeketli: friend
 dericeketli: hello
 dericeketli: how are you
 Spacialman: Wow, mornings look very lively.
 jacek: mornings?
 Spacialman: Yeah
 Spacialman: I was looking back in the chat
 Spacialman: and I'm like, "whoa, every one is so nice here"
 Spacialman: Oh @jacek, I wanted to show you this, I thought it was pretty neat.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&amp;h=2&amp;v=3&amp;f=Alpha&amp;t=hello">https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&amp;h=2&amp;v=3&amp;f=Alpha&amp;t=hello</a>
 jacek: is yours?
 Spacialman: No,
 Spacialman: I was looking at different sites for chat thingies and I found this
 Spacialman: But I am making something kinda like it.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: where's the referee for Fireworks&#160;?
 AntiSquid: trictrac
 mmjacob: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i thought it would be more fun  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/527688659">https://www.codingame.com/replay/527688659</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's so confusing, and the game rounds don't end with a correct notice.  For example, trying to do a SAY with 0 communications says "round ends, no blue token"  so wierd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and the game continues for 3 rounds after last card is taken... but how do I determine a discard if I don't know a card exists in my hand
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so you have to discard a card with a known 1/2 value instead of a card with no known values... so wierd
 JohnathanBarbee: I'm irrationally angry at Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
 JohnathanBarbee: the input and output moves are in (y,x) format. This explains why my code doesn't work, but I can't easily fix it.
 JamesModifiedGames: Like the hellboy picture @johnathonbarbee
 JohnathanBarbee: Thanks!
 Uljahn: indexing 2D arrays/tables by (row, column) is very common though
 JohnathanBarbee: Ah. I'm used to x and y coordinates.
 darkhorse64: PatrickMcGinnisII: you have to manage you own hand, if you play a card, it is replaced with a new unknown, unless there is no more cards. You have also to manage the number of remaining cards. In retrospect, it could have been an input
 darkhorse64: I mean, if you play A, A is replaced, there is no reordering
 struct: also when using loops you should pay attention so you dont get many cache misses
 struct: int arr[y][x]for(int i = 0; i &lt; x; ++i)for(int j = 0; j &lt; y; ++j)arr[j][i]...
 struct: is bad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darkhorse64 yes, i se now how you could determine if a card exists at a position in your hand.  But what I'm finding is that the sheer number of discards required to guarantee enough information to complete all fireworks is impossible.  it takes 2 discards to get the information on every replaced card.  The pobability of a 'perfect' game is so low I might as well play the lottery
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so to take care of the end game of 3 turn scenario (which is like every round it seems), that if 1/2 a card's info is given at that point, then maybe a 'perfect' game is a little more probable
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I know the game is mostly heuristics, and it can get a little messy ... but it's just not fun if a perfect game is so unlikely
 darkhorse64: The aim of the game is to gather and provide as much information as possible on the cards in play. by discards, you mean hint&#160;?
 darkhorse64: afk for a while
 PatrickMcGinnisII: to earn a hint, you get by placing a lvl5 color, or discard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i mostly just wanted to see referee, 'cause it took me forever to figure out some of the round ending stuff, cause the output is so wierd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the burden to wood1 is kinda high.  i could make some improvements to the SAY determination portion, but once you get to midround, it's all pretty flat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I shut up.  I want people to play it.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gtg glhf
 jacek: oO
 darkhorse64: I would recommand to play against yourself (4x IDE code). It helps to check whether you convey the right information and are able to take the most of it. As your bot improves, you will see your score increasing. Being able to exploit the tiniest bit of information will result in a noticeable improvement
 Gloopy: darkhorse64, ton Bot sur Bandas c'est un MCTS standard&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Oui avec un solver #fr
 Gloopy: Oups
 Menox: what is making the random beeps when im playing clash of code?
 rwilson: @Menox -&#160;? random&#160;?  Perhaps it's the 'clash finished' notice.   If the match is still going after you submit, it could be several minutes before you here the end notice.
 Menox: cool :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, probably just the notifications.
 Menox: thanks for the explanation
 Astrobytes: It beeps when it's about to start as well no? Or before the end? Long time since I did one.
 Menox: in the middle of the game
 Astrobytes: Probably other people submitting.
 YurkovAS: jacek broke my lucky submit in onitama
 Nerchio: when is the next event
 Nerchio: it should be visible to unlogged users to be honest
 Nerchio: on the main page
 Nerchio: i had to dig in to find a date of the competition when my friend asked
 Astrobytes: :shrug:
 FluffyHub: omg these challenges are tough
 FluffyHub: even if it said easy but its not 
 MSmits: it's not for the fluffy-hearted
 reCurse: Always relative isn't it
 MSmits: yup
 AntiSquid: march right? Nerchio or was it early may?
 Drewskiii: subjective to say the least&#160;;)
 RockNTroll: site is slow?
 Papaver: Yes, it is always slow at this hour
 Papaver: I understood they are computing stuff like ranks etc?
 Vigasaurus: Yeah
 RockNTroll: oh gotcha
 RockNTroll: woohooo solved it
 komple1: .
 RockNTroll: :grinning:
 loneman: hh
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: hii

 Automaton2000: you don't have to look into that
 aCat: hmm, the contest will actually end monday morning?
 reCurse: As usual
 aCat: You know that actually I'm rarely active on this platform&#160;:&gt;? 
 aCat: However when I am active I make a lot of fuss around ;p

 Arnav-S: Can anyone help me figure out what we have to do in Reverse Engineering CodinGame puzzle, i solved it but my how do i get to a better rank??
 MadKnight: collect the score points
 MadKnight: ez
 Arnav-S: I dont understand
 Arnav-S: what do you mean collect?
 Arnav-S: how do i improve my rank in that particular puzzle
 MadKnight: PM
 AntiSquid: check forums Arnav if you want spoilers, puzzle is about figuring out how to play the game
 Nagatwin: Hey
 Nagatwin: Ani advice of resource for code vs zombie&#160;?
 Nagatwin: got a full random search, would like to improve
 struct: What score do you get Nagatwin?
 Nagatwin: 190k
 struct: I think you need lucky submit
 Nagatwin: 170 sometimes, depends on the submit
 struct: I think top is hardcoded
 struct: at least mine is
 Nagatwin: How do you hardcode&#160;?
 struct: There is one validator that you get over 400k points
 struct: Validators are "leaked"
 Nagatwin: hm
 Nagatwin: Okay thanks
 dbdr: Nagatwin <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators</a>
 Nagatwin: Thanks
 Nagatwin: dbdr :D
 dbdr: it should be fair
 BeeGee: Is there a shortcut to play the custom testcase?
 struct: I just run the sim offline
 struct: I just read the coordinates one time in my code anyways
 struct: after that I update the game state depending on my output
 MSmits: just invited all my last year CS class students to join in the contest. Many of them have finished all tests, so I hope at least 1 or 2 will join
 MSmits: I should ask my colleague to invite the other students as well
 struct: the more the merrier
 MSmits: we have over 100 total CS students so it should be possible ot get 3 in a team. Not sure
 struct: Prizes might be announced tomorrow
 MSmits: ah cool, dont really care about the prizes though. 
 MSmits: if there is no prize i will participate just as seriously
 struct: Yeah, for me it doesnt matter too, I have no skill to fight for them
 WINWINWIN: Same here struct&#160;:)
 MSmits: which is odd. You are obviously a great coder,
 MSmits: not sure what you think you're lacking
 MSmits: maybe just need practice
 struct: Maybe, sometimes I tend to rush stuff too
 MSmits: well there is a time limit
 struct: You are doing bitboard on STC right?
 MSmits: yeah, i know it works, but i dont know if it is fast
 MSmits: the flood fill might be a bit slow
 struct: how does the board look like?
 MSmits: uint16_t[6]
 MSmits: for each color
 MSmits: and one for all colors combined
 MSmits: and one for skulls
 MSmits: one uint16_t is a column
 struct: ah
 MSmits: because it;s 12 high
 struct: so 6 6
 MSmits: the whole board is uint16[42]
 Astrobytes: One for skulls?
 MSmits: yes
 struct: 7*6
 MSmits: right
 struct: Why one for skulls?
 struct: and one for colors?
 struct: colors combined*
 MSmits: you need to floodfill it per color
 MSmits: colors combined is just to know what will fall
 MSmits: if red disappears, the other colors fall too
 MSmits: so you need a full board to know where the holes were made
 MSmits: skulls also disappear. I floodfill a color, then i floodfill it 1 more cell to disappear adjacent skulls
 MSmits: i need the skull board for that
 LoGos: STC - Smash the Code?
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: Oh I thought you meant just 1 uint16_t
 LoGos: thanks
 Astrobytes: lol, that explains that :D
 MSmits: nope, it's a full board per color&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: For the skulls I meant
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: A board of them makes more sense, I need another coffee clearly
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: here: :coffee:
 Astrobytes: Thanks :P
 MSmits: well I need to get 1 million sims to see if it's worth it
 MSmits: it might not be
 Astrobytes: only one way to find out
 MSmits: yep
 darkhorse64: For those afraid of bitboarding, you can get by with a simple 2D array. It may be slower but it's plenty fast enough
 MSmits: it might be faster
 MSmits: I have to do a lot of ops to make it work and also some conditions
 darkhorse64: Don't know and did not try. I did not reach the 1 M sims but I reach Legend 
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: do you eval connected colors?
 MSmits: like 2 or 3 of the same color adjacent?
 MSmits: or just score?
 struct: You also want to eval the column  
 MSmits: what do you mean struct?
 struct: Place in middle is better
 darkhorse64: I wrote a GA to find the best combo. Wood to Gold with it. I have a construction score: 2 connected &lt; 3 connected. That values constructs with potential
 MSmits: hm ok
 AntiSquid: oh MSmits planning to top the school leaderboard&#160;? :p
 MSmits: how about 4 connected with a hole in it?
 darkhorse64: I have also a score for columns
 MSmits: AntiSquid not gonna happen, i just want my school on there
 MSmits: We should do ok if I do ok
 struct: These are my numbers
 darkhorse64: I did not score holes. The gold boss is very hard
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456862718">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456862718</a>
 struct: F = floodfills
 MSmits: nice struct
 struct: You dont want games to get so long too
 struct: That was just to get a general idea
 struct: I post moterm, rank 1 says he had around 1.4mill
 struct: sims
 MSmits: struct do you just have an array of objects?
 MSmits: an object is a cell?
 MSmits: cell can be empty, red, blue, skull etc.
 struct: int8_t grid[HEIGHT][WIDTH];
 eulerscheZahl: the gold boss is definitely beatable
 struct: The number is the color
 MSmits: ahh I see
 struct: I also have these int8_t columnsHeight[WIDTH] = { 0 };
 eulerscheZahl: i offer grid[WIDTH][HEIGHT+2]
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you have that too
 LoGos: Sorry to interfere. Any tips on how to tune parameters (hyperparameters?)&#160;? I'm currently doing grid search but I'm not sure it's the best use of time.
 MSmits: why + 2
 darkhorse64: Once I understood why I was losing, yes
 struct: So you have like a lookup table for legal moves MSmits
 struct: I haveLookup **ptr = &amp;lookupTable[0];
 eulerscheZahl: and colors on the board to know if we can skip a BFS
 MSmits: I dont have much of anything yet, just been working on my "apply move" function
 WINWINWIN: In botters of the galaxy
 WINWINWIN: if this error comes
 WINWINWIN: Can't attack unit of id: 24
 WINWINWIN: does it mean that the unit is behind a bush?
 AntiSquid: maybe it died when you try to attack
 eulerscheZahl: or is it yours?
 MSmits: LoGos I just mess around with cg benchmark and excel or sometimes a local test if it is worth  playing my bot against itself
 AntiSquid: show replay&#160;:/
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456864012">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456864012</a>
 AntiSquid: frame&#160;?
 LoGos: MSmits thanks for the reply. I currently have a python script that changes my c++ code and runs CGBench on it
 WINWINWIN: 45
 MSmits: LoGos that works
 WINWINWIN: This time the err was cant attack unit of id&#160;: 32
 struct: There is some more stuff I do too
 struct: I might go back to STC after contest
 struct: I simulate all possible states for enemy until certain depth
 struct: and store best score
 AntiSquid: hover your mouse over the units WINWINWIN
 struct: for each depth
 AntiSquid: there is no id 32 alive
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, it died before I could reach it, thanks AntiSquid
 struct: at depth 3 is 10648 moves at worst case
 struct: So I think its worth
 MSmits: yeah might be
 struct: The problem is that the game is decided too early imo
 struct: You make 1 wrong move and you lose
 AntiSquid: you can attack your own units if they are low on health btw WINWINWIN
 MSmits: thats true for both players struct.
 MSmits: should factor into your bot
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, not really working on gaining gold for now
 struct: Yeah, I guess this happens in many multies
 WINWINWIN: Mostly following blitzprog`s PM
 struct: Now that I think, it also happens on Yavalath
 WINWINWIN: attack the entity closest to my tower from as far as possible
 MSmits: it does struct
 struct: Game is decided in under how many moves?
 struct: 6?
 MSmits: if noone makes a mistake 61
 MSmits: but bots make mistakes
 MSmits: then its over fast
 MSmits: yay my colleague said he would join the contest
 MSmits: and invited his students as well
 MSmits: hope we get a few
 MSmits: I worry it may be too hard a game, but we'll see
 struct: Time to see some dutch flags at the top

 IAmNoob: AntiSquid thx&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: i'll use it

 MadKnight: cut links
 VincentYam: same here - is there anywhere I can look for the solution?

 Craytek: help me
 AntiSquid: yes but it requires an avatar VincentYam
 VincentYam: What is an avatar...and how do you get one?
 AntiSquid: a profile picture
 AntiSquid: any image

 reCurse: And he deleted his account. Well played
 jacek: again?
 MadKnight: anyone good with c# project references? i'm having trouble linking projects to each other
 AntiSquid: maybe he should ask from his main next time about shared solutions?
 reCurse: MadKnight what's the issue
 MadKnight: i'm trying to use OpenTK in my xamarin project
 MadKnight: the only way i found to add it to the project is from nuger, i found this OpenTK.NetStandard which works on 2.1
 MadKnight: but by default it created project with 2.0 so i had to switch to 2.1
 MadKnight: but now my android project doesn't wanna import 2.1 project
 reCurse: Ok xamarin is off limits for me
 reCurse: Maybe it only supports up to a certain version of .net standard
 jacek: xamarin? for android?
 MadKnight: i'm doing References (of android project) -&gt; Add reference -&gt; Projects -&gt; (my NetCore 2.1 project)
 MadKnight: then i Build
 MadKnight: and it says it could not find netstandard2.0/MyProject.dll
 MadKnight: why is it trying to find 2.0&#160;?
 reCurse: Because I assume your android project is using 2.0?
 MadKnight: project uses 2.1 now and builds into netstandard2.1/
 MadKnight: can't find anything related to core version in android project settings
 reCurse: Then maybe it's bound to 2.0
 MadKnight: sad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: default dir setting?
 MadKnight: okay it says it maybe uses 2.1 since android 10
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok lets see if i can level up
 MadKnight: oh, i managed to install an older version of openTK on 2,0
 PatrickMcGinnisII: whoop, lvl 31
 MadKnight: gj PatrickMcGinnisII
 MadKnight: are u doing puzzles&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: was doing tulips and daisies, got bored...yup did a puzz
 MadKnight: &gt; Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Xamarin\Android\Xamarin.Android.Common.targets(1793,2): warning XA1009: OpenTK 0.9.3 is Obsolete. Please upgrade to OpenTK 1.0

 wlesavo: wow, there is an 2048 based puzzle, ive wrote autoit bot for it, basically the first bot i tried to make, quite bad obviously. i think it would be a fun optim if one able to overcome turn limitation
 eulerscheZahl: i thought about it as well
 eulerscheZahl: but i see no way with the given limits
 eulerscheZahl: you can create a minesweeper puzzle. and spam submit until you pass the validators
 struct: How long are 2048 games usually?
 eulerscheZahl: several thousand turns
 struct: Limit for optimization and normal puzzles is 30 sec too?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: 600 turns
 dbdr: offline it?
 MadKnight: where does nuget install packages? where can i find the .dll&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: part of the game is that you don't know where the spawns happen
 MadKnight: u can make 3x3 2048 struct
 eulerscheZahl: just that 2048 would be an impossible number then
 MadKnight: yea
 Scarfield: more like 64 then&#160;:)
 dbdr: what if you had a seed and could predict the spawns? would it be trivial then?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that's an option
 eulerscheZahl: you can even still play it online. just ask for the next 10 actions or so
 struct: 6k frames :D
 eulerscheZahl: we've seem around 2k at xmas rush already
 eulerscheZahl: code of the ring is limited to 10k
 struct: o.o
 jacek: 2048 eh? found interesting papers about it
 eulerscheZahl: and should be easy to implement if we accept that we have to give a seed for spawning
 Scarfield: some people apperently play 2048 to get as low a score as possible
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand the unknown spawn is part of the challenge. assume the worst and prepare for it
 jacek: how would one go about bitboards for gomoku
 jacek: 15x15 doesnt fit in int64 :c
 dbdr: maybe we could specify that the spawn will be the worse possible&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i saw such a tetris game
 eulerscheZahl: always tries to block you as good as possible
 jacek: i saw tetris with only s and z
 dbdr: evil tetris, sth name like that I think
 dbdr: HATERIS

 Astrobytes: Well, he was on topic at least
 Astrobytes: (Auto. 2000 that is)
 AntiSquid: he asked nicely :p
 Astrobytes: JBM I cannot unsee, or indead un-hear, that 'performance'. I should stay out of #fr, really
 JBM: lol
 Astrobytes: *indeed
 JBM: that was the point
 JBM: le cringe

 JBM: truly painful

 JBM: drink more
 Astrobytes: SQuido's teetotal
 JBM: well... stay far from youtube links then
 Astrobytes: Haha
 Astrobytes: How the hell did you find that one anyway JBM?
 JBM: it's a long story
 Astrobytes: I see
 JBM: it started this afternoon with dbdr telling his bot intently crashed when his opponent SWAPped at Twixt
 JBM: which got me to tell i was going to write a swap-then-wait bot
 JBM: when i came back from whatever, he'd fixed that
 JBM: so i whined
 JBM: with lyrics that rhymed with a well-known french tune
 JBM: that inspired me to start working on an actual song
 JBM: and we got to exchange our best recollections of programming-oriented performances
 JBM: the all-time favorite "write in go" (take the fall 2014 edition and no other)
 JBM: the "god wrote in lisp"
 JBM: and then... the F flat performance was part of the fall 2019 playlist
 Astrobytes: Alright, very well explained
 JBM: well it *is* a long story
 Astrobytes: Kinda wish I'd been around in #fr for that earlier
 JBM: lol

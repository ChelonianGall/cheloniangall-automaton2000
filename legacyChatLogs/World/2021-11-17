 Coding_Aria: It's 1:54AM there, right?
 Codeab: its 1254 pm here
 Coding_Aria: Then Singapore time is 1 hour later than South Korean time
 Codeab: qns tho
 Codeab: y is there so few code golf challenges
 Codeab: codingame should agg more
 Coding_Aria: Golf challenges are so hard
 Coding_Aria: Well, did you tried WINAMAX Sponsored Contest?
 pyprogammer: when are these challenges conducted?
 ZXC01: hi
 ZXC01: hi
 ZXC01: hi
 ZXC01: o
 ZXC01: o
 ZXC01: o
 pyprogammer: hi
 Coding_Aria: Hey, ZXC01, if you spam then you'll be banned
 ZXC01: how
 Atharv-.-: hello
 Coding_Aria: pyprogrammer, the WINAMAX Sponsored Contest can be played at any time.
 Uljahn: ZXC01: wanna try?
 Atharv-.-: :p
 Atharv-.-: Mods are here always :eyes:
 Atharv-.-: So u r one of the mod
 Atharv-.-:&#160;?
 Coding_Aria: I'm not a moderator
 Coding_Aria: But Uljahn is a moderator
 Atharv-.-: :EYES
 Atharv-.-: :EYES:
 Coding_Aria: There's also Nicola and Illedan here as moderators
 Atharv-.-: :eyes:
 Coding_Aria: :eyes:
 Atharv-.-: Okay
 Uljahn: mods are not CG employees, they have their own work to do, so they are here in their free time
 Atharv-.-: Okay
 Coding_Aria: Oh! I thought they're employees from CodinGame
 Coding_Aria: Atharv, who is your favorite moderator?
 Atharv-.-: So how u u guys ban if u are not the employees?
 Uljahn: mod == moderator
 Coding_Aria: First, they warn. Then, they report. After that, they ban them.
 Atharv-.-: I just entered the chat Coding_Aria .. Idk any mod here
 Atharv-.-: Ooo okay..hm
 Coding_Aria: Well, I don't know how others become moderators...
 Atharv-.-: :shrug:
 Coding_Aria: There are 3 mods here
 Atharv-.-: :joy:
 Atharv-.-: Ooo
 Atharv-.-: :wind:
 Atharv-.-: Idk much about the mods here.. ik about discord.. :rolling_eyes:
 Uljahn: moderators are selected among most loyal regular users by CG staff
 Coding_Aria: Moderators are always kind, they check if there's a one spamming or saying inappropriate contents
 Atharv-.-: Well this chat is pretty active today..  good to see that..
 Coding_Aria: You're right,
 Coding_Aria: It was even more active few months ago
 Atharv-.-: Gtg bye guys.. enjoy coding.
 Coding_Aria: Okay! 
 Coding_Aria: Bye
 Atharv-.-: I came here. 1 month ago
 Coding_Aria: Well, 2 of my old accounts are hacked so I'm currently using this now, but I came here 3~4 months ago
 Atharv-.-: Oooo
 Atharv-.-: Accouts hack here too :eyes:
 Atharv-.-: :sob:
 Coding_Aria: Of course,
 Atharv-.-: Bye
 Coding_Aria: Actually, not only my account, 
 Coding_Aria: Also on my whole computer
 Coding_Aria: However bye
 Coding_Aria: ...3 mods and me only? That's lonely.
 ZXC01: j
 Coding_Aria: Wait, you're there? But you're a bit spammer
 ZXC01: how come i can talk here
 ZXC01: and how come he can ban me
 Coding_Aria: Hey, moderators sure can ban you! Uljahn, who is one of moderators warned you. Then he might report you then ban you
 ZXC01: did he unban me??????
 Uljahn: it was a kick
 Uljahn: so you've been warned
 ZXC01: and you added me?
 Coding_Aria: Hey, ZXC01, I don't think he added you, you just came to the World chat again.
 Uljahn: kick forces you to leave the chat but you can rejoin, with a ban you can't rejoin
 ZXC01: how did i rejoin.....
 Coding_Aria: Because you're only kicked but not banned for now
 Uljahn: you can press F5 or wait 5 minutes
 ZXC01: ok thx
 ZXC01: how do you play mad pod racing?
 ZXC01: i just dont understand the instructions
 Coding_Aria: I'm in Bronze League of Mad Pod Racing

 RavenKZP: Hi, whats the trick in Solid Intiger (puzzle of the week) with "Output might overflow Validator"??
 RavenKZP: I cant get why i have wrong result there&#160;:/
 Coding_Aria: Sorry, RavenKZP, sharing answers aren't a good thing
 5DN1L: RavenKZP Check out the forum topic and see whether the discussion there helps you

 RavenKZP: Yep, but I'm not searching for answer, just some clue
 RavenKZP: @5DN1L Thanks :D
 5DN1L: You're welcome&#160;:)
 Codeab: ez
 Coding_Aria: nicola, Codeab, Uljahn, and me. Again. I'm bored
 Uljahn: pls don't ping moderators by typing their names in the chat, Coding_Aria
 Codeab:&#160;? aria is pinging?
 Codeab: idk how to ping
 H00n: just type someones name
 Codeab: oh
 Uljahn: like this, Codeab
 Codeab: hello Uljahn
 Uljahn: message containing your nick will be highlighted in red
 Coding_Aria: Hey Codeab you also pinged a moderator
 Codeab: i was testing
 Codeab: ...
 H00n: this is getting ridiculous :sweat_smile:
 Coding_Aria: However, OK, I'll not ping anyone else in World chat, but why is it like that?
 Codeab: idk
 Coding_Aria: Umm hello?
 Coding_Aria: Nvm.
 Coding_Aria: Never mind, forget it
 Coding_Aria: I can't ping moderators then can I ping others
 Coding_Aria:&#160;?
 Coding_Aria: Oh come on!
 Coding_Aria: I'm so bored,
 Coding_Aria: No one there?
 Coding_Aria: ...
 Coding_Aria: Never mind
 Coding_Aria: __________
 Codeab: lol
 Uljahn: pls go be bored somewhere else, no need to spam here
 Coding_Aria: Fine... T_T
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: She doesn't spam, otherwhise she'd be banned. Think a little Uljahn... :smirk:Mods these days...
 Coding_Aria: Blaise, he said to not ping moderator names.
 Uljahn: warning first, then kick, then ban, that's the mods' algo
 Coding_Aria: Hey, I was just trying to ask but no one was replying me
 Thorcode: how to use join to do this
 Thorcode: I got 1 2 3 I want to change it to 1+2+3
 Coding_Aria: I don't know
 Coding_Aria: Let's chat in your private message because mods think that I spam
 Thorcode: I know how to do that thanks
 Coding_Aria: Umm, don't need to thank me since I didn't helped you; 
 Gemmelemineheure: why do I like to get into 12 year olds?
 Coding_Aria: I'm 9
 Gemmelemineheure: send nudes on mp
 Uljahn: banhammer time :rolling_eyes:
 RavenKZP: :head_bandage::hammer: 
 Coding_Aria: :joy:
 Coding_Aria: RavenKZP is funny, he's hit by a hammer and got harmed
 darkhorse64: gg Uljahn; these people are disgusting
 darkhorse64: please remove this dude from fr too if you can
 Uljahn: i'll try
 Uljahn: i can't, sry&#160;:(
 5DN1L: Maybe [CG]Thibaud can help?
 Uljahn: or Magus
 Coding_Aria: Come on I'm not spamming now
 RavenKZP: why when i do 4611686018427387904/9 in c++ i get 512409557603043072 and in python i get 512409557603043100
 RavenKZP: where res from python is correct but test from cpp pass :thinking:
 Alshock: probably an overflow RavenKZP
 AshuCoder: Maybe both have different ways of approximating answer
 5DN1L: RavenKZP if you cast int in python it will not turn into scientific notation and get rounded
 5DN1L: int(4611686018427387904/9)
 [CG]Thibaud: :eyes:
 Coding_Aria: Think of it yourself, you Donn't have to post it here:unamused:
 RavenKZP: I'm doing this way, casting to int
 Alshock: 4611686018427387904//9 in python3 yeah
 Alshock: 5DN1L I think it does return a float and only then cast it to an int with a regular div though
 RavenKZP: Alshock wow... worked but why?BTW Thanks 5DN1L again i found my mistaque thanks for rours link :D 
 Alshock: not sure bc python
 Alshock: well then I might be right / returns a float and only then you cast it back to int
 Alshock: with a rounding after about 15 decimals
 5DN1L: I just experimented a bit...
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c305ca3f-7f9e-44a1-910a-8fc481511b4e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c305ca3f-7f9e-44a1-910a-8fc481511b4e</a>
 Coding_Aria: Why are you guys like that? You tell the answer to RavenKZP while you warn me and tell to not ask for answers when I ask?
 Uljahn: Doubles have 52 mantissa bits and 2^52 = 4,503,599,627,370,496
 Alshock: bc we like them and hate you ofc @Coding_Aria :smirk:
 ZXC01: hello, can anyone help?how to use boost command in mad pod race
 Mr.Presqu: I use it at start, but it's just useless there, perhaps use it if you get shocked out of track by other pod
 ZXC01: what????
 Mr.Presqu: lol
 Mr.Presqu: whats your question?
 Mr.Presqu: print "BOOST" i think
 ZXC01: the boost command....
 ZXC01: ok......?
 Mr.Presqu: it only works once in the race from what i recall
 [CG]Thibaud: it's written in the statement
 ZXC01: hmmmmm
 ZXC01: hellllllp how to pass wood leageue 1
 H00n: beat the boss
 ZXC01: ...........
 H00n: If you want to do it manually, watch the replays in which you lost
 H00n: then figure out why you lost
 H00n: and try to fix that problem
 AntiSquid: and wait for 100% submit
 H00n: oh true that
 H00n: you can remove the boss from your test and add other players bots
 ZXC01: wow antisquid is the 10th!!!!!!!
 H00n: so if you are ranked high but always fail against certain other bots, you can try to figure out why 
 AntiSquid: oh lernard climbed cool
 ZXC01: erm the video deosnt seem to move at all
 H00n: then you might have thrown an exception
 H00n: there should be a text in the output telling you what happened
 H00n: usually in red
 ZXC01: ok....
 H00n: this might happen if you print our an unexpected value (out of range)
 ZXC01: at first my rank 200 nw 8000
 H00n: or fail to print in time
 ZXC01: how to use boost
 H00n: read the game description
 H00n: there's documentation for it as soon as it is unlocked
 H00n: the games mechanics change with each league
 ZXC01: i know
 H00n: then why ask?
 ZXC01: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) ,'BOOST')
 ZXC01: doesnt work
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: missing space
 ZXC01: k thx
 H00n: he should be able to figure that out given the exception
 ZXC01: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) +' '+BOOST')
 ZXC01: cannot....
 ZXC01: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... ZXC01 will no longer be active in this game.
 ZXC01: helllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllp
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: There's probably another error message before.
 ZXC01: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eca34074-ec14-4161-94ec-7b57b9aeca65">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eca34074-ec14-4161-94ec-7b57b9aeca65</a>

 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: This is.
 ZXC01:&#160;???
 ZXC01: helppppp
 ZXC01: helphelphelp
 ZXC01: :cry:
 [CG]Thibaud: don't do that
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Stop spamming, start reading ZXC01...
 ZXC01: hellllllllllllp
 Uljahn: ZXC01: try print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, 'BOOST')
 Uljahn: and stop yelling
 ZXC01: ok thanks
 ZXC01: but where???
 5DN1L: And the thrust in your code is wrongly formatted too
 5DN1L: Stop yelling here
 ZXC01: how then....
 [CG]Thibaud: next is ban ZXC01
 ZXC01: bruh.....
 Uljahn: you should learn the basics of python before you start practicing
 ZXC01: i learnt
 Uljahn: you wish
 ZXC01: im 3790th in clash of codes
 ZXC01: i just dont undrstand this ai thing
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: No. You need to read. Read the stateement, read the previous answers, read the error logs, and even read what you did in your code...
 Uljahn: try "Power of Thor - Episode 1" puzzle, it's very similar to bot ai games, also it has hints on the left to make things clear
 ZXC01: ok thx
 Yayax: :heart:
 [CG]Thibaud: thanks
 LelouchVC2: u guys are up late
 LelouchVC2: or up early
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: or not in your time zone...
 LelouchVC2: imagine not living in my time zone
 Yayax: what do you mean pedo messages are you talking about mine&#160;?.?
 Yayax: oh my bad you're talking about the german chan :x
 H00n: there was someone talking about having sex with minorities and spamming cursewords for no reason
 H00n: *minors lol
 H00n: *minors lol
 H00n: sry tried to edit didn't want to spam my self
 Yayax: ... what kind of trash can type that 
 Yayax: hope he got banned 
 Alshock: hey there I'm facing a weird issue: my C++ code segfaults when I optimze it (O3 or 0fast) - ofc it segfaults on optimized out variables. It sounds like there's an undefined behaviour somewhere. But if I send the code in valgrind the code works AND it doesn't find any error or warning (-Wall -Werror yields nothing either)
 Alshock: what could I do to track down what's really happening&#160;?
 DomiKo: -Wall -Werror won't find undefined behaviour
 DomiKo: you need flags for debuging
 DomiKo: -g -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address
 DomiKo: these will help
 Yayax: Hi, I'm new to python and I'm trying to get the next element of my list but it keeps telling me "can't concatenate str to int, could some one help me pls&#160;? 
 Yayax: here's the code I typed
 Yayax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a2804d2b-0ba8-4843-86c1-21005eb1a448">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a2804d2b-0ba8-4843-86c1-21005eb1a448</a>
 Yayax: line 6
 Yayax: sry wasn't the full code, here is it

 5DN1L: Not sure what binaire contains, but if the variable i is a string, you cannot add 1 to it directly?
 Yayax: oh right sorry it's a list 
 Yayax: here's the def 
 Yayax: def convert_to_binary(uncodded): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a1f81a4-3e41-40f5-8075-95c161295cc8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a1f81a4-3e41-40f5-8075-95c161295cc8</a>
 Yayax: I'm not trying to add 1 I want to check the next element of i
 5DN1L: then it would not be i+1
 Yayax: ok I see, do you know which command I should use to check the next element of my list&#160;? 
 5DN1L: name_of_list[index+1]
 Yayax: Thank you very much for that fast response&#160;!
 5DN1L: You're welcome&#160;:)
 Yayax:&#160;:)
 Yayax: btw just for my own education is there a reason i and index doesn't do the same&#160;? I thought i ment index ^^'
 Alshock: @DomiKo but they also let it pass without a word (valgrind does basically the same)
 nicknameasterix: guys, what does $&lt; mean in ruby? I know gets assigns to $_, but no mention of $&lt;
 Alshock: @Yayax for i in ... b
 Alshock: means i becomes each elements of ... consecutively
 Uljahn: Yayax: you can do "for ix, nb in enumerate(i):", then ix will be current index, and nb will be equal to i[ix], and the next element will be i[ix+1]
 Alshock: if you want the index do for i, value, in enumerate(...)
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Alshdock
 Alshock: Blaidse &lt;3
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :hugging:
 Yayax: I see, thank you so much guys you're awsome &lt;3
 Uljahn: that's pretty basic though, more complicated solution to iterate by two consecutive pairs would be "for nb, nb_nxt in zip(i[:-1], i[1:]):"
 Alshock: I think it's slower though, as you create and zip two generators
 Alshock: or two entire lists? Idk how sublisting is handled behind the scenes
 Uljahn: just switch to numpy and work with views (no copy or new array is created when slicing)
 Damzyzx: ok
 iiShrimpy: i have no idea what im doing, the introduction isnt great as it just has you copy and paste it and ive never coded before, so idk what to do.
 iiShrimpy: im using python btw.
 Lack2651: try some tutorials on youtube
 iiShrimpy: they dont help me much.
 Lack2651: you should watch introduction to programming 
 Lack2651: in python
 Lack2651: they have a bunch of good tutorials on youtube u just have 2 look
 iiShrimpy: Alright.
 Lack2651: maybe i cna recommend you some lemme go see
 Lack2651: if you search youtube for python tutorials for begginers there is a bunch of free stuf that pops up
 iiShrimpy: ahh
 Lack2651: just chose the one you like the most and learn 
 iiShrimpy: Its still very confusing bc i dont understand what im typing but they do.
 Lack2651: idk how else I can help you
 Lack2651: but in those courses they tend to explain it 
 Lack2651: hence the "begginers"
 iiShrimpy: alright, ty, ill watch them later
 Lack2651: np

 H00n: The better my bot gets at beating the boss, the worse they perform against other players&#160;:&lt;
 struct: which game H00n?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you should try losing vs the boss then?
 Blueshirtguy: Fart
 eulerscheZahl: kick
 jacek: euler has no chill
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: slash
 eulerscheZahl: i just threatened so far
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Fart then /fart
 JoDim98: De ste cigani?!
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 VincentKriek: statteee
 VincentKriek: stattee
 JFB: JoDim98: Ah, the similarity of the Slavic languages. Got it even without google translator. After the Poslku it will be "Jesteście Cyganami?". Or, politically more correctly, "Jesteście pochodzenia romskiego?". But to answer the question, as far as I know I am not a gypsy, for example. 
 JFB: It reminded me of Brad Pitt playing the gypsy boxer in 'Snatch'. I already know what I will watch tonight&#160;:-)
 jacek: my little pony, the movie?
 JFB: it was elementary, my dear Watson&#160;;-)
 struct: is the site bugged?
 struct: is not showing the online people on the leaderboards
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Because you're alone...
 struct: its working now
 struct: maybe it was just delay or something
 JFB: probably
 H00n: struct "Code Royale"
 Wontonimo: something that happens H00n is that a solution (or bot or algo) can be too focused on a singular aspect of some problem and not really do well in the general case
 Wontonimo: this is what is probably happening to your bot
 eulerscheZahl: hey JFB. I saw you provided a C++ starter bot for bomberland
 eulerscheZahl: i might use it as a starting place for my own C# bot (haven't decided yet, if I'll play)
 Wontonimo: if instead of code royal, the game was Rock Paper Scissors and the boss always picked Rock, and the people in this league always picked Scissors, you'd not be able to get promoted if you pick paper
 eulerscheZahl: do they still have the concurrent move where the faster player has an advantage?
 H00n: Got to take a day next weekend to rebuild my bot from scratch, it's a hacked mess atm, since I just built on my prototype since it did so much better than I thought. It's clearly at its limits now, RIP my queen :disappointed_relieved:
 jacek: prototype finished? post it to production
 H00n: though it is funny I can't laugh about that
 jacek: why not

 adam_liu: it is me
 H00n: Sounds too much like my workplace
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: hi adam_liu :wave:
 BlackstrikeSK: I am wondering abt Mad Pod Racing boost thing, I can't figure out the solution.
 nolcoder: hi guys how is everyone doing
 asioud: im gay
 nolcoder: cool
 nolcoder: i have to doo school work  be back in a bit
 H00n: BlackstrikeSK one easy solution would be a flag outside your gameloop which tells you whether or not you used your boost
 H00n: this way you make sure to use it only once and not get a misinput
 asioud: Alexandre Dube
 asioud: Aléxandre
 Wontonimo: you can use boost multiple times.  the first time it is effectively like saying "thrust 650" and every time after that it means "thrust 100"
 jacek: oh really?
 H00n: but that's at a higher tier right? or was I blind to that as well :D man I really haven't given that game much thought
 asioud: below is gay

 eulerscheZahl: funny website (sorry for German): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://afd-muell.de/">https://afd-muell.de/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a very right-wing german party printed flyers for the election. then they needed someone to deliver them to each citizen
 eulerscheZahl: this flyer service was a completely made-up company with only a single customer: that one political party
 eulerscheZahl: instead of delivering, they just shredded the flyers

 eulerscheZahl: AFD deserved it. they even deny a human origin of climate change
 eulerscheZahl: the 72 tons of waste were already there. still waste, when you deliver it
 Wontonimo: could have recycled it, or used it as wallpaper
 Wontonimo: but who would want to be surrounded in that propaganda 
 Wontonimo: how about insulation in an "earth ship"
 Wontonimo: no, same issue
 Wontonimo: bad mojo for the hippie
 Westicles: climate change is the 2nd biggest hoax right now
 Wontonimo: the 1st is climate deniers who believe that it's a hoax
 Wontonimo: science buddy, science
 Wontonimo: i know science is not a popular thing in the US, but doesn't make it not real
 Westicles: science is dead.  these days they find the result their funders want.  popper is rolling in his grave
 Wontonimo: science is being attacked in the US by the Republicans in order to rally the uneducated masses.  Science is otherwise alive and well outside the US 
 jacek: science is math :scream:
 GamingGnawer: that is a pretty clever hoax, and a good reminder to always validate user input... Just because they say they're a delivery service or have entered a valid input, doesn't mean it's true ^^
 eeeeeeerrrr: pi i am watching you
 eeeeeeerrrr: i know you are reading this
 eeeeeeerrrr: i am stalking your every move.
 eeeeeeerrrr: you cannot escape.
 eeeeeeerrrr: pi, this is it
 vacuum: pi , u done
 jacek: good old wednesday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Kyle Rittenhouse Wednesday
 jacek: bird is a word
 Schwase: can someone explain to me why avogadro's number is an SI base unit
 Schwase: its just a number
 Schwase: like there's 7 base units and one of them is mol
 Schwase: how does that make sense
 FranceIsAfraid: because it's a physical costant
 FranceIsAfraid: kinda like how we use pi for measuring an angle in math
 FranceIsAfraid: for radians that is
 Schwase: but as an SI base unit?
 FranceIsAfraid: I don't see a reason not to
 Schwase: there are 7 base units
 FranceIsAfraid: yeah
 FranceIsAfraid: and?
 Schwase: length - metertime - secondmass - kgetc.
 Schwase:&#160;??? - mole
 Westicles: metric units were invented by the french to make wine glasses bigger
 Schwase: would it just be "a unit of counting"
 FranceIsAfraid: the number of carbon 12 atoms in a gram of carbon
 FranceIsAfraid: that's the scientific definition
 Schwase: pi - the ratio of the area of a square with side length 1 and a circle with radius 1
 Schwase: that doesnt make pi an si unit
 FranceIsAfraid: I guess a mol is just that more frequently used
 Schwase: like does there need to be "a unit of counting" in the SI base units?
 FranceIsAfraid: in the medical field it's all mol baby
 Schwase: but this is "System De Internationale" not just any unit of measurement gets in&#160;:(
 FranceIsAfraid: yes, and the fact that mol is in it and pi isn't demonstrates the constraints of popularity and usefulness of the ones that do get in
 Schwase: the meter is in, that means no other units of length measurements get in, my point is, 1 mole doesnt measure something, its a unitless value, a conversion rate. 
 FranceIsAfraid: a mol is a unit
 Schwase: but 1 mole has the same units as 1 atom
 Schwase: why not make the unit "1 thign"
 Schwase: *thing
 FranceIsAfraid: because when working with atoms, you get incredibly big numbers very quickly
 FranceIsAfraid: so you just make that big number a unit to avoid that problem
 Schwase: i understand the need for the mole, its clearly a very significant value
 Schwase: the same could be said about examining distances in space, meters is a ridiculous unit, so we use light years instead
 Schwase: but 1 light year is still not an SI unit of measure
 Schwase: because 1 meter is the SI unit of length
 FranceIsAfraid: because it's not as popular or useful
 Schwase: but "1 thing" is more popular than "1 mole"
 Schwase: like, 1 mole is a measure of 6.02E23 things
 FranceIsAfraid: saying one thing is not a very precise, and therefore, not very scientific way of describing something
 Schwase: "1 units"
 Schwase: its ambiguous because it is a counting unit
 FranceIsAfraid: calling a unit of measurement "unit" is very confusing to say the least
 Schwase: but its the same whether you count atoms, cows, or stars
 Astrobytes: Schwase: are you studying chemistry?
 Schwase: physics
 Westicles: heh heh.  weed legalized in NY last month might be a factor here
 Schwase: not 21 for a few months
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about mols then. Makes more sense in chem that physics.
 Astrobytes: *than
 Schwase: i mean i took chemistry twice and i understand and appreciate it and mols is definitely applicable in physics in plenty of circustamces
 FranceIsAfraid: so I don't see a problem here
 Scarfield: how many mols in a mole
 FranceIsAfraid: 1
 Schwase: 1 mol = 1 mole
 Schwase: its just an abbreviation
 ChwanPang: 97x0 47x0 96x0 67x0 96x0 47x0 16x0 c6x0 56x0 25x0 02x0 66x0 f6x0 02x0 97x0 27x0 f6x0 56x0 86x0 45x0
 ChwanPang: what kind of code is this?
 FranceIsAfraid: hex?
 Schwase: ye
 Schwase: f6x0
 Schwase: hex
 struct: reversed hex
 ChwanPang: nan its not
 ChwanPang: oh reversed hex alright
 FranceIsAfraid: whenever I see a mess I just automatically assume it's hex
 Schwase: would change the SI unit of measure of "amount of substance" from 1 mole to 1 unit or 1 count of substance change anything other than its value? Would it still achieve the same role as an SI unit?
 Schwase: *changing
 FranceIsAfraid: well yeah, of course it would. Just like how in science we just chose the greek alphabet because it's neat. whatever's more convenient
 FranceIsAfraid: and it just so happened to be that a mol is convenient
 Westicles: changing it would mean burning all the periodic tables and raising world temperature by 8 degrees
 Schwase: degree what :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: i can get behind that explanation France
 FranceIsAfraid: cool cool
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)#Criticism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)#Criticism</a>
 FranceIsAfraid: amazing
 Scarfield: you are not the first to question it as a si unit, but when i asked for how many mols in a mole, i meant mole the animal
 Schwase: yeah i found a few posts about it when i was looking for more answers
 Astrobytes: valid criticisms, but still useful in an awful lot of calcs
 Orlans: 0.0?
 Schwase: i basically found this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/320892/what-are-the-reasons-for-making-the-mole-a-base-si-unit">https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/320892/what-are-the-reasons-for-making-the-mole-a-base-si-unit</a>
 Astrobytes: molefield
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: joke was too dumb for the level of chat, i had to "explain" it
 Schwase: ^ that means it was a funny joke
 FranceIsAfraid: aside from physics, the thing that drives me insane are complex numbers
 Schwase: as someone who is consistently explaining jokes, i approve
 Astrobytes: mols of what in a mole tho', is the real question
 Schwase: mols of mole
 Scarfield: xD
 Schwase: that would be 1.660539e-24 mols of mole in 1 mole, of course
 Astrobytes: heh
 Astrobytes: anyway, gotta run, cya later 
 Scarfield: cya
 Schwase: :wave:
 FranceIsAfraid: a neat way of getting the mol in a mole would be dividing the mass of the mole by the sum of the molar mass of all the individual molecules composing it
 Schwase: molecules or atoms?
 FranceIsAfraid: same thing
 FranceIsAfraid: as in, the molar mass of a molecule is the sum of the molar mass of the atoms
 Schwase: ok
 FranceIsAfraid: so just save an extra step and say molecules
 Schwase: but moles of what
 Schwase: moles of molecules
 Schwase: or atoms
 Schwase: not the same thing
 FranceIsAfraid: I know it's not the same thing
 FranceIsAfraid: it's just you're using the same method over and over again
 Scarfield: moles of mole as established, obviously
 FranceIsAfraid: to get the over-all molar mass
 Schwase: the molar mass of a mole would be 6.02e23 times the mass of 1 mole
 Schwase: 1 mole of mole is 6.02e23 moles
 Schwase: i think we may have played this out for long enough now lol
 Scarfield: when i see "molar mass" i think of teeth
 FranceIsAfraid: disgusting 
 Scarfield: i clearly am not a chemist
 FranceIsAfraid: mathematician&#160;?
 Schwase: both molars and mole have similar etymology
 Schwase: relating to earth one coming from "millstone" and the other coming from "earth thrower"
 Schwase: one greek (molars) and one germanic (mol.)
 Schwase: latin not greek sorry
 Scarfield: should i be flattered or mad that you are guessing mathematician? :p
 Scarfield: but no, mechanical engineer
 Schwase: clearly an intellectual :nerd:
 Scarfield: probably not if you asked a mathematician
 Schwase: i go to a very engineering heavy school, im used to having mostly engineering and computer science majors in my classes
 FranceIsAfraid:  I'm still in first year of highschool so I'm still wondering what to do
 Schwase: 9th or 10th grade? (or do you use a different numbering system than that?)
 FranceIsAfraid: 11th 
 Schwase: do you go through 12th?
 FranceIsAfraid: you know what a baccalaureate is&#160;?
 Schwase: the exam or the degree?
 FranceIsAfraid: okay
 FranceIsAfraid: so
 FranceIsAfraid: there's kindergarten
 FranceIsAfraid: then it's 6 years primary school
 Schwase: yes
 FranceIsAfraid: then 3 years middle school
 FranceIsAfraid: then 2 years highschool
 Schwase: oh interesting
 Schwase: i had the same thing except 3 years of high school
 Schwase: K-6, 7-9, 10-12
 Em.707: Thank you France
 FranceIsAfraid: germany?
 FranceIsAfraid: why you thanking me?
 Schwase: LMAOO
 FranceIsAfraid: hm?
 Em.707: clears up everything for me, my third eye has opened 
 FranceIsAfraid: huh?
 Em.707: But what is Germany?
 FranceIsAfraid: I heard in germany they do 13 grades
 Em.707: my classmate wants to know
 Schwase: lol the germany line was :ok_hand: :ok_hand:
 Schwase: ohhh
 FranceIsAfraid: what?
 Schwase: i thought you were replying to "thank you france" with "germany?"
 FranceIsAfraid: oh
 FranceIsAfraid: huh
 jacek: oh my
 Em.707: I mean I also could be
 FranceIsAfraid: I'm pretty slow
 Scarfield: xD
 Schwase: but no, im american
 FranceIsAfraid: didn't even cross my mind
 Em.707: awwww
 Orlans: yo no entender español!!
 Em.707: bonjour
 FranceIsAfraid: yes hello
 Schwase: no habla englais
 Orlans: un placeru
 Orlans:  XD
 Orlans: nuu U.u
 Schwase: France, are you French?
 Schwase: or somewhere else?
 FranceIsAfraid: no but can speak it fluently
 FranceIsAfraid: it's just an old ongoing inside joke with my buddies
 Orlans: .-. not
 Schwase: makes sense
 Em.707: I learned a bit of French but not alot
 FranceIsAfraid: what makes sens O' enlightened being?
 Pingu430: I suck at coding guys
 Aladdin89: hi guys
 Schwase: try coding girls instead then pingu
 Schwase: the username makes sense
 Schwase: + your explanation/story
 FranceIsAfraid: bro I just learned what a boolean is
 Schwase: sounds scary :o
 Schwase: get it
 Schwase: cause it starts with BOO
 FranceIsAfraid: yeah
 FranceIsAfraid: also, I'd like to mention that my actually has nothing to do with the country
 Schwase: oh ok. your name is why i asked "France, are you French"
 FranceIsAfraid: it was just a happy accident with a number generator and one too many discord calls
 Schwase: so i figured you were responding to that but i see where the discontinuity was
 hamburjesus: chese
 JJWooster: perl or ruby?
 JJWooster: man I feel like imma catch a bullet for asking that one
 Roberts98: php
 JJWooster: man what the hell
 JJWooster: I'd rather learn cryptic archaic bullshit from the 80's than learn php

 Thorcode: hi
 Shoyo_Hinata158: im doig tic tac toe i am almost finished
 Thorcode: in that game I just make my bot tic randomly
 Shoyo_Hinata158: i keep winning
 kkweon: how do i rejoin the chat that i just closed
 Thorcode: how can I take rid of the last space in this line
 Thorcode: print(i, end=" ")

 Shoyo_Hinata158: i guess nothing
 Thorcode: yep
 Shoyo_Hinata158: but i need help can you send me a easy coding game bc this one is hard
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: what ez
 Shoyo_Hinata158: nvm
 Thorcode: oh You want a platform like codingame but easier? 
 Shoyo_Hinata158: yea
 Thorcode: I think I don't have one
 Shoyo_Hinata158: oh ok
 programX: no contest
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: no contest at this time
 programX: i am newbie
 Thorcode: ok
 Daxlo: It would be nice to have easier ones for like learning a new Language.
 Daxlo: I think their thing is to attract the elite coders to then attract employers.  If they are king of the noobs, not so much revenue.  :-)
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: what do you mean Daxlo
 JayDiamond: Daxlo kind of has a point. I checked out this website because of a youtube short, and I saw they had Bash as an option so I got super excited because I've been meaning to learn bash. But it kinda just throws you in there. You're expected to know the syntax before you start on this site.
 JayDiamond: But this site is pretty fun
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: we must know the basic before play codingame
 Thorcode: so bored
 Thorcode: the puzzle in here pretty hard
 BartholomewIII: Which puzzle
 Thorcode: power of thor ep 2
 BartholomewIII: hmm, I'll take a swing at it
 Thorcode: do you guy have any hard puzzle in here that is ez
 BartholomewIII: lol
 BartholomewIII: isn't that a contradiction in terms?
 Thorcode: yep
 BartholomewIII: nice

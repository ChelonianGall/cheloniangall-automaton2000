 WINWINWIN: eulerschezahl not 1st anymore?
 eulerscheZahl: objectively seen i should have never been there
 WINWINWIN: May have to do a couple Clash of Code to get there :P
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care about the overall leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: only the contest leaderboard matters for me
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, that's more dynamic and tougher to be top in
 eulerscheZahl: royale played a multiplayer, gained 800 points and now he's first. he could have done that earlier, not a matter of skill, just time invested
 WINWINWIN: Oh, thought that you made an accidental tanking submit
 eulerscheZahl: no, others can improve too
 eulerscheZahl: and the top is close <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global</a>
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 mark7: What does dynamic sorting want to say. I can't understand the problem statement even.
 mark7: if age is same then sort them by name, if name is same sort them by gender and if gender is same sort them by surname? Am i getting it correctly? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes. depending on the search query of course
 mark7: Okay thanks&#160;:-)
 mark7: Yay weekly problem solved&#160;:-)
 MSmits: hey eulerscheZahl, did you see what i said about onitama last night?
 MSmits: you'll like this
 struct: What did you discover?
 MSmits: ok so you know how I've been running thousands of CG bench games to fit constants?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: so I was wondering why I have a winrate of 80% in cg bench and only 60% or so on cg stats
 MSmits: less vs karlis o and tric trac
 MSmits: turns out, my json file was configured to only ever run seed 0
 MSmits: so i got nr 1 overtraining on one seed :P
 struct: lol
 Illedan: hahaha
 MSmits: the same 5 card always
 Illedan: I felt that
 MSmits: already getting better now, after having started with full random
 MSmits: for example  I did not have knight-count in my eval because it did nothing for seed 0, but at full random it seems to help a little
 eulerscheZahl: that's a great way to use the CG servers :P
 MSmits: lol... well it wasn't completely for nothing. Just really silly :P
 LelouchVC2: :o
 eulerscheZahl: and still you somehow managed to get first
 MSmits: yeah, I suppose different cards makes a differents but it's not everything
 MSmits: difference
 eulerscheZahl: on a coinflip with the other two at the top
 MSmits: the other two?
 eulerscheZahl: with a similar score to yours on the leaderboard
 MSmits: oh, right
 eulerscheZahl: i'm glad to see some activity for that game now. was dead before
 MSmits: it's one of the best games on CG I think
 MSmits: people just dont know it
 MSmits: i enjoy it a lot
 MSmits: has great depth
 MSmits: randomness prevents hard coding
 MSmits: and looks good
 MadKnight: oh the contest starts in 6 days
 struct: Will prizes be announced today?
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know
 MadKnight: what's the prize, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: am i the only one
 MSmits: you're not a prize
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 says Automaton2000 is the prize
 eulerscheZahl: win an Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: so now i can do the same
 Automaton2000: what are you doing atm marchete?
 eulerscheZahl: where is Marchete?
 MadKnight: will magus ship this prize&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea, Automaton2000 misses him
 Automaton2000: wish there was a problem
 MSmits: eh
 MSmits: you wish there was a problem with what Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: if i can do it in c#
 struct: Have you coded an Yinsh bot yet Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: how to do any of you solved the puzzle of the week?
 LelouchVC2: where's that?
 struct: puzzle of the week?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/dynamic-sorting">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/dynamic-sorting</a>
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: why are you flipping out Illedan
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456336815">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/456336815</a>
 Illedan: I can't figure out why me damn goalkeeper is hugging that ball
 MSmits: it doesnt know whcih way to turn
 MSmits: happens in csb
 MSmits: depth issue
 MSmits: turning in csb takes 10 turns for a full 180
 Illedan: no turning here?
 Illedan: Charge by angle..
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: this is like meanmax?
 Illedan: y
 Amirabbas: it would be great if there was a rematch button in the private clashes....i send them this request ...I hope they do that
 MSmits: it;s awfully close to the goal
 MSmits: floating point issue?
 Illedan: maybe
 wlesavo: may be if you try to go negative coors it would be easier to grab
 wlesavo: it is possible to print out coors beyond the board, dont know if it helps though
 Illedan: Yeah, I know
 wlesavo: anyway seems to be a rare case
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan when you move towards it, you will push it in your own goal?
 eulerscheZahl: or at the last the sim thinks it
 RoboStac: I think you might just not be able to pick that up with the 8 angles - it's partly over the goal line so you'd have to hit it pretty exactly to cover it before rebounding away
 MSmits: smart RoboStac
 MSmits: that's it ofc
 pb4: What 8 angles&#160;?
 MSmits: FB
 RoboStac: he's only trying 8 movement angles 
 wlesavo: he simulates at 8 angles
 pb4: oh right
 MSmits: Illedan is doing what you told me to do a year ago pb4
 pb4: I don't remember what I said :D
 MSmits: you told me to use smitsimax on FB
 pb4: oh right
 MSmits: never got around to that
 pb4: Probably a lot of room to improve on FB
 MSmits: yeah, it's a messy game
 MSmits: pretty hard, complicated sim too
 pb4: my thing is still a GA, and it's kind of been shown on other games that there are much better approaches
 MSmits: might not be smitsimax though, i had my doubts.
 MSmits: but Illedan is doing ok so far
 pb4: how ok&#160;?
 MSmits: top gold I think?
 MSmits: not sure if he beat the boss already
 pb4: @Illedan, for your problem, one possibility would be to add a special 9th action
 pb4: 9th action would be "pick closest snaffle up" and would have some kind of logic/geometry to go as close as possible to the snaffle while avoiding the wall
 MSmits: yeah thats close to what I suggested about scoring
 MSmits: have an extra action with heuristics for a well aimed shot
 pb4: yup
 MSmits: pb4 will you be in next contest as well?
 MSmits: I know you are time restricted
 pb4: Probably not, I've largely exhausted my wife's patience with ooc ^^
 MSmits: thought so, good to see you in it though
 MSmits: and grats on the win, not sure if i said that before
 pb4: At first I justed wanted to toy with the tracker.... had no intention to go further -_-'
 MSmits: haha, but once you get going...
 LelouchVC2: At least you have a wife
 MSmits: he's not complaining about having a wife lol :P
 pb4: I did find interesting that there were different approaches to the game at the top
 MSmits: yeah, i saw that in eulers stats
 MSmits: hey, i Q-learned an AI for NIM
 MSmits: so next up, alpha zero :P
 pb4: ha
 pb4: ha ha
 pb4: ha ha ha
 MSmits: this was just for an AI class I am doing
 pb4: Table-based&#160;?
 MSmits: need the study credits to become CS teacher
 MSmits: it's a dictionary with states, so i guess so
 pb4: Yup
 pb4: Q-learning is well-behaved and proven to converge in its table-based form
 MSmits: seems pretty obvious that it would converge
 MSmits: i also know a bit more about these convolution nn's 
 MSmits: but i find it hard to imagine training for an entire CG game
 MSmits: so many states during a game and only one reward at the end
 pb4: If you really want to try, I suggest starting small on an easy game before trying harder games
 MSmits: yeah i know
 MSmits: I was thinking of doing it over the summer
 MSmits: once my teaching is done
 pb4: CSB - runner only - no opponent&#160;: that's a very good starting point
 MSmits: yeah, problem is i dont like csb that much. I would prefer something like oware, not necessarily oware, but some board game
 pb4: You'll need some tooling, but there is some existing that you can reuse
 struct: connect 4 should be one of the simplest
 pb4: Board games bring two more difficulty compared to CSB&#160;:
 MSmits: discrete input
 MSmits: i know this
 MSmits: whats the second?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thats ok, i can start on tic tac toe as well
 pb4: and you have to  express the game as a game with final states
 MSmits: not sure how that would work
 pb4: in CSB you can just say that there are infinitely many CP to take, and the objective is to pick them as fast as possible
 pb4: In nim, at some point you don't propagate gamma*best_next_state_reward.
 pb4: At some point you've won and you propagate 1
 pb4: or you've lost and you propagate 0
 pb4: in infiniate CSB with a runner only, you never win or never lose
 pb4: inifinite
 pb4: All states have the same status, no  need to handle "end-game"
 pb4: Also there's inherent variety in CSB due to random CP positionning&#160;: it's much easier to guarantee that the neural network will have good exploration
 pb4: In NIM or board games, it'll get ugly if you don't explore enough or explore too much
 pb4: Not saying it's impossible, far from it
 MSmits: is this where the drop out thing helps?
 MSmits: at least with overtraining
 pb4: Dropout is a type of layer in neural networks, it helps with not overfitting the data fed to the network
 MSmits: tensorflow seems to have a lot of easy options for this. Should I use that?
 MSmits: yeah
 pb4: I'm speaking about not feeding always the same info to the NN&#160;:)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: well you have data, you split that into test and train data
 MSmits: and you can vary the train and test data
 pb4: If your NN always trys the same first move in the game, you'll always feed the same value
 pb4: Let's say you can play 10 different moves at the beginning
 MSmits: so, basically yavalath
 pb4: Your NN always tries move 0
 pb4: Even if you split between test/train, there's only be move 0 in the train data
 MSmits: hmm right
 pb4: It's not exactly the same, but think about a MCTS with C = 0
 MSmits: yeah
 Illedan: Might work with an heuristic yeah
 pb4: @Illedan, if I may suggest&#160;: try to see how high you go without spells
 WINWINWIN: @pb4, can you go that high without spells
 WINWINWIN: Using a simulation?
 pb4: It's probably with simpler for smitsimax, and it can go pretty high
 pb4: much*
 Illedan: I do spells as a heuristic on the side now
 Illedan: Didn't add them to the search hyet
 tutubalin: We found an issue in Van Eck's sequence puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/van-ecks-sequence">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/van-ecks-sequence</a>
 pb4: #12 without spells
 WINWINWIN: If I write a Monte Carlo with no spells, can I get till gold?
 pb4: (legend)
 Illedan: -.-
 WINWINWIN: Wow
 MSmits: WINWINWIN they dont use monte carlo though
 Illedan: pb4, that tells me my eval is very bad at the moment :P
 MSmits: monte carlo is almost always weak
 tutubalin: It says that sequence starts from A0 and we need to find An, but according to tests, it uses 1-based indeces. So it starts from A1.
 pb4: Illedan&#160;: hence my suggestion :D
 WINWINWIN: MSmits Monte Carlo willl get somewhere right?
 pb4: This way you'll know when your eval is not the limiting factor :D
 MSmits: sure
 WINWINWIN: But you need to simulate collisions right?
 Illedan: true :P
 MSmits: you need to simulate everything if you want to do it right
 pb4: bullet-proof engine&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Wouldnt collisions be too performance heavy as there are too many entities?
 Illedan: I sim everything and can play the full game vs myself without getting an off by 1 error
 pb4: :thumbsup:
 struct: What depth Illedan_
 struct:&#160;?
 Illedan: 4
 Illedan: 2k playouts
 MSmits: in csb i do 7
 Illedan: I think I need more sims to go deeper
 struct: You prune moves?
 Illedan: no
 MSmits: 2k is very few indeed
 struct: yeah
 Illedan: 8k sims
 pb4: Don't bother with more playouts though
 pb4: depth 4 is perfectly fine
 MSmits: it's a very chaotic game
 pb4: at least on my GA, depth doesn't really matter
 MSmits: more depth could be meaningless
 pb4: just need &gt;= 3
 MSmits: same with meanmax right?
 Illedan: My meanmax bot has depth 2 :P
 MSmits: lol
 pb4: No idea, didn't try smitsi on meanmax
 MSmits: i mean the depth thing
 MSmits: it's also a low depth game
 pb4: probably yes
 LoGos: Does NN really work on CG?If your code is 20-30 KB then you have space for about 17500 floats to paste. Is it enough or do you somehow compress it?
 pb4: We compress it
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary">https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary</a>
 pb4: for an example
 LoGos: Yeah, but isn't that tool cheating?
 struct: only on contests
 struct: multiplayer you can do w/e
 LoGos: ...
 LoGos: god I hop eulerscheZahl does not use it in Bandas
 LoGos: hope*
 LoGos: struct, only during active contests or any contests?
 eulerscheZahl: i used it for STC in the past but not anymore
 eulerscheZahl: at some point CG updated the languages and my submission broke, easier to ensure your bots are still working when you don't submit binaries
 eulerscheZahl: and less risk of losing your code
 struct: LoGos only during active contest
 LoGos: ok, so you have 10 x more rollouts than me without it. Going back to optimizing my mcts
 LoGos: thanks
 LoGos: I was scared I was optimizing my code for 2 days for nothing :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: my bot even uses C#. That tool is for C++
 LoGos: oh, yeah. I forgot
 RoboStac: LoGos - my bandas submission is a NN using ~22000 16 bit floats 
 pb4: AZ&#160;?
 RoboStac: yeah
 LoGos: EULERSCHEzAHL,  the funny thing is I can't get close to that number even if my simulation takes 0 time (it just returns a 0 or 1) :cry:
 LoGos: is AZ some kind of architecture?
 pb4: I should go back to making my AZ work on Oware -_-
 pb4: still bugs me that it fails so hard....
 RoboStac: based on alphazero (the google mcts+nn hybrid)
 LoGos: thanks
 MSmits: LoGos karlis o's bandas bot is not a nn. 
 MSmits: you dont need a nn to be competitive is all I'm saying
 MSmits: at least not in bandas
 struct: csb is the exception for now
 MSmits: it seems so, but it's not 100% sure
 MSmits: the distance between Pen's non-NN bot and anyone elses was enormous. If Pen could be so much better, maybe something else can also. Something that will compete with the NN's as well
 struct: He never said what he was did he?
 LoGos: I think I understand his point. He is telling me that while NN sounds powerful that does not mean everyone should use it. Karlis' bot is an example. Yeah?thank you MSmits. I have another question. Do you send your code as binary? I'm just asking because I don't want to waste time optimizing my code while I could use it too
 struct: What do you mean optimizing?
 LoGos: make as many simulations as possible per turn
 struct: Im not sure that binary will increase your performance marginally 
 struct: I mean that might only increase it marginally*
 LoGos: I'm going to test it now. Brb
 RoboStac: as long as you have the optimisation pragmas sending as a binary barely makes any difference now
 RoboStac: at least for c++
 pb4: ^
 pb4: and in Vindinium's case, it made a large negative difference&#160;:/
 pb4: Still don't know why
 LoGos: Yeah, you are right. No difference :disappointed:
 MSmits: I never used send binary
 MSmits: i think you need linux for it too
 MSmits: I am on windows
 Nerchio: why you can't find many top players in multis? they don't resubmit after challenges end?
 MSmits: several reasons
 MSmits: some contests dont immediately become a multi
 MSmits: well they do now
 MSmits: but before they didnt
 MSmits: also every contest has a different set of players participating, some always join but many dont
 MSmits: and the contests span like 8 years or more
 MSmits: not all players have been on CG that long or have been here a long time ago and never came back
 MSmits: you wont find my bot in ex-contests of 3 years ago probably
 MSmits: with some exceptions
 Nerchio: makes sense i guess :p
 MSmits: it is a bit hard to define a top player btw. For some players its easy to say, but other players are almost always around 50-100 in rank and then suddenly one contest really clicks with them and they get top 10
 MSmits: the games are different and different skills may be required
 IAmNoob: hi guys!
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 is a girl
 Automaton2000: you can just take a look
 AntiSquid: ya have a look
 AntiSquid: 2014 first multi MSmits
 Nerchio: is there any easy way to ctrl+c the output
 IAmNoob: i dont think so
 IAmNoob: but what are the width and the height of the screen if "Coders Strike Back"?
 Nerchio: idk never played it
 Willem640: 16000x9000 i think
 IAmNoob: thx
 IAmNoob: i think the height is a little smaller
 MSmits: you can go off screen
 MSmits: so it doesnt matter
 MSmits: not that there is any reason to go off screen ofc
 MSmits: but you can
 IAmNoob: not in pixels
 MSmits: pixels dont matter
 IAmNoob: i mean in the measrement
 MSmits: positions are doubles
 IAmNoob: that they use
 MSmits: yes they dont use pixels
 MSmits: they use doubles
 IAmNoob: i know
 IAmNoob:  how much is the screen in doubles
 MSmits: the viewer is meaningless really, it's just so you can see where your pods are
 IAmNoob: i know
 MSmits: i dont understand your question IAmNoob
 IAmNoob: sry i am unclear
 IAmNoob: if i want to give my pod the coordinates of the center
 IAmNoob: what should they loock like
 MSmits: ohh I see. Not exactly sure, but if you want a "center" you should probably just take the average position of the checkpoints
 IAmNoob: and how can i do that
 IAmNoob: because at the start i dont know all of the check point
 MSmits: add up all the checkpointX and divide by number of checkpoints
 MSmits: ahhhh
 IAmNoob: yes
 IAmNoob: i know how
 MSmits: dont overthink it if you're in wood 1
 MSmits: or wood 3 i dunno
 MSmits: make a simple bot
 IAmNoob: i am bronze 2
 IAmNoob: so i need:(
 MSmits: bronze 2??
 IAmNoob: yes
 MSmits: dont you mean wood?
 IAmNoob: no
 MSmits: there is no bronze 2
 Willem640: in debug mode you can hover with your mouse to see coordinates
 Willem640: i think the middle is around 8k 4.5k
 IAmNoob: ok but they arent the same every turn
 Astrobytes: Woods-&gt;Bronze-&gt;Silver-&gt;Gold-&gt;Legend
 IAmNoob: yes
 IAmNoob: now in bronze
 Willem640: im out here severely overthinking my bot
 Willem640: in wood
 MSmits: dont you get all coords in bronze?
 IAmNoob: no
 RoboStac: no, not till gold
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: thats silly
 Astrobytes: Yeah...
 IAmNoob: :p
 IAmNoob: yes
 Willem640: yeah
 MSmits: csb really needs some revamping imho. It's the worst tutorial
 MSmits: gives the wrong impression about CG
 IAmNoob: yes
 RoboStac: the tutorial bits fine, it just leaves you in a really awkward place
 IAmNoob: yes
 MSmits: sorry, i mean the whole progression to gold
 Astrobytes: That's putting it lightly&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: no problem
 IAmNoob: its ok
 MSmits: should we just give him the "trick"  ? 
 MSmits: then he gets to a league with coords
 IAmNoob: no
 IAmNoob: dont want
 MSmits: good answer
 Astrobytes: I don't usually tbh, I find they learn more by doing it the long way
 IAmNoob: i'll make it all aabout my own
 MSmits: they do
 MSmits: I just dont want them to get frustrated with the changing input
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, it's a silly situation
 Willem640: what's the trick?
 Willem640: don't spoil it just a hint
 MSmits: it's just a heuristic to prevent oversteering, you can come up with it yourself
 Astrobytes: :zipper_mouth:
 MSmits: so you dont go in circles around checkpoint
 Willem640: oh that's kinda cool
 IAmNoob: no&#160;:(
 Willem640: i'm gonna try to write something like that
 MSmits: i am not giving the trick
 MSmits: IAmNoob
 IAmNoob: thx
 IAmNoob: i dont need any
 MSmits: i just describe a problem that you need to fix
 IAmNoob: i'll make all about my self
 Astrobytes: But let's just say: Don't multiply your velocity by pi
 MSmits: ha no, dont do that
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i would just start with a different multi really
 AntiSquid: most multis are easier
 MSmits: some, not most imho
 AntiSquid: all grid based ones (except for UTG OOC) are easier
 MSmits: if you know how to write a search
 Astrobytes: I think I've seen this conversation 3 days in a row on this chat, maybe 4...&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: even if you don't
 Willem640: i'll give them a try, sounds kinda cool
 MSmits: not all of them have easier heuristics
 MSmits: try it with oware
 AntiSquid: oware isn't actually a grid
 MSmits: it's a 2 by 6 grid
 AntiSquid: play kutulu Willem640
 MSmits: kutulu is cool
 IAmNoob: it make my code brocken
 IAmNoob: made*
 struct: Wondev Woman is good
 MSmits: kutulu teaches you simple searches like bfs
 IAmNoob: dfs is easier
 IAmNoob: and shorter
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 MSmits: dfs and bfs are equally hard
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't call it grid MSmits , because it's irrelevant how you represent it, you can have a list where you connect the start and the end
 MSmits: you're just replacing a stack with a queue
 IAmNoob: yes
 IAmNoob: but is shorter to type
 IAmNoob: the dfs
 IAmNoob: in c++
 AntiSquid: actually you can't move up and down at any point
 IAmNoob: is only 5 lines
 MSmits: ok AntiSquid, but that makes it even easier than a grid&#160;:)
 MSmits: cuz its 1 dimensional
 MSmits: it's a 1 dimensional grid&#160;:)
 MSmits: circles are 1D
 AntiSquid: point is gird games are easier .
 MSmits: the representation and the sim is easier
 AntiSquid: circles are 1 D&#160;? in what universe
 MSmits: they are
 Nerchio: damnit i started meeting people who do the mine trap on 1st column in crystal rush xD
 AntiSquid: no the aren't&#160;:/
 MSmits: surfaces of spheres are 2D
 MSmits: circles have no thickness, its a line with the 2 ends connected
 MSmits: lines are 1D
 AntiSquid: you can only represent a circle in 2d space, otherwise it's a line
 MSmits: actually you can represent all points on a given circle with 1 coordinate
 MSmits: so it's 1D
 MSmits: it's a 1 dimensional curved space
 struct: circle is 1d indeed
 Astrobytes: You can only travel in 2 directions
 Astrobytes: so it's 1D
 Astrobytes: But in the 2D space
 AntiSquid: if you fold the piece of paper around the line sure you can get a circle but that's not real 1d
 MSmits: mathematically it really is 1D, the conceptual circle that is, not the actual paper one, that's 2D
 MSmits: or 3D even
 IAmNoob: I am a math student and i am sure the circle is 2D
 IAmNoob: but is a vector
 IAmNoob: which is 1D
 IAmNoob: so the both are correct
 AntiSquid: represent everything in a 1 dimensional array, he it's 1D&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Smits explanation is on point
 IAmNoob: point is not
 IAmNoob: array of points

 Astrobytes: It really doesn't need much explaining
 AntiSquid: pointless conversation, point was grid games are easier
 MSmits: yes they generally are 
 MSmits: to simulate that is
 Astrobytes: Mostly yes
 MSmits: to search, not necessarily. Some are hard to find good heuristics for
 MSmits: so then you need something like minimax
 AntiSquid: physics games can require googling for trigo formulas so eh ...
 MSmits: right, difficult sims
 AntiSquid: you don't need that much knowledge for a basica grid .
 MSmits: i separate sim and search
 MSmits: a sim is not an algorithm
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: not a search algorithm
 Astrobytes: *may contain algorithms
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: to me the actual writing of a bot is not in the sim, thats just copying the game and it's annoying
 MSmits: unless it involves bitboards
 Astrobytes: lol MSBits
 MSmits: the sim really turns me off from FB, meanmax etc.
 MSmits: so i see AntiSquid's point for sure
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm still putting those off
 MSmits: but i see it more as a lot of boring work to do
 Astrobytes: It can be tedious
 Willem640: aigth i think i've reproduced the trick
 MSmits: thats quick
 Astrobytes: Are you now in gold?
 Willem640: just have to wait for the boss to oversteer and i win
 Willem640: no
 MSmits: not sure if thats the trick
 Astrobytes: It's not the trick then.
 Willem640: oh
 Willem640: hm
 MSmits: you have to somehow get your bot to start steering before it gets to the checkpoint
 MSmits: like you would in a real race
 Astrobytes: Don't wait for any other bot to do something, take charge of your pods
 Willem640: oh
 struct: The trick doesnt beat wood 2 boss I think
 struct: but beats wood 1 until gold
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: i dont see why it wouldnt?
 Astrobytes: same
 Willem640: so you do some kind of sick drift?
 MSmits: yes, sick drift
 MSmits: let's call it the sick drift trick from now on
 Astrobytes: Yes, you're getting the idea 
 struct: no collisions, and wood 2 turns preety well
 Astrobytes: CSD
 struct: and always same map
 Willem640: haha
 Astrobytes: Code Sick Drifts
 struct: 1vs1 you wont win vs boss
 struct: with trick
 Willem640: i did some kind of blakc magic with vectors before this
 MSmits: really... too bad i cant test
 IAmNoob: Drifts are a way to go
 IAmNoob: i am sure
 IAmNoob: but sometimes
 Willem640: so it would aim next to the checkpoint and drift
 struct: Ill test give me 3 min
 IAmNoob: it gets stuck
 MSmits: Willem640 I got to gold with some weird search with vectors
 Astrobytes: I did vectors and steering behaviours
 Willem640: haha
 Astrobytes: Loads of ways to do it really
 Willem640: i'll have to perfect it some more then
 MSmits: i wrote 200 lines, but this trick gets you to gold with 10 lines or so... i thought it was annoying =/
 Willem640: how do you know which way to steer before the checkpoint?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I just feel you miss out if you don't do it the long way, as I said before. Seems a shame to waste the experience
 MSmits: you know where the checkpoint is, use that
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: and correct somehow for what your pod is doing
 Willem640: okay
 IAmNoob: is there a silver too?
 MSmits: yes
 IAmNoob: after those
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: thx
 MSmits: bronze silver gold legend
 IAmNoob: yes
 struct: lol the scores on wood 3
 struct: are all negative
 struct: even boss
 Astrobytes: Woods-&gt;Bronze-&gt;Silver-&gt;Gold-&gt;Legend
 Astrobytes: oh Smits beat me
 IAmNoob: wood 3 i got top1
 MSmits: someone do some wreckin'  struct?
 darkhorse64: Is there a way to know which puzzle you have done per language&#160;?
 Astrobytes: probs all broken bots struct
 struct: There is a site I think darkhorse64
 MSmits: ow hey darkhorse64, I wanted to share something funny with you. i'll pm, already told it on WC twice
 darkhorse64: wrong fitting&#160;?
 MSmits: oh you read that
 darkhorse64: Yeah
 MSmits: cool huh, my bot wa awesome at seed 0 :P
 darkhorse64: I was definitely surprised that you did not crush the leadderboard
 Astrobytes: still funny&#160;:)
 MSmits: you mean when i shared my cg bench?
 darkhorse64: which site struct
 MSmits: yeah you were right it was weird
 MSmits: but obvious now
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/index.php">https://chadok.info/codingame/index.php</a>
 struct: As  you can see
 struct: the trick gets beaten
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456372358">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456372358</a>
 struct: By wood 2
 Astrobytes: lol nice
 MSmits: seems to me the trick is not done right?
 AntiSquid: UTG has a really terrible referee, who wrote that code? it's even worse than mine
 MSmits: steers too late
 MSmits: yeah definitely too late
 struct: But the code is right
 MSmits: what is yours AntiSquid
 struct: If I pass wood 2
 MSmits: can pm me the code?
 struct: Ill get gold with exact same code
 MSmits: yeah ok, but the code may still be wrong&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: which one?
 AntiSquid: was saying UTG referee code is worse than what i can write
 MSmits: oh i thought you meant a specific contribution of yours
 MSmits: i was just wondering which of yours you thought were bad
 AntiSquid: @_@
 MSmits: btw struct is right the map is bad, his code is perfect&#160;:)
 MSmits: but the trick is the same, prevent oversteering, just dont do it the way you would in bronze or higher
 struct: The trick for wood 2
 struct: Is just do what they tell ytou
 struct: They give you pseudo algorithm
 Astrobytes: aim at the cp
 IAmNoob: yes&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: h
 ZarthaxX: hai
 Astrobytes: Greetings Lord Zarth of aaX
 struct: ZarthaxX you join next contest?
 ZarthaxX: hello Lordastro
 ZarthaxX: i suppose tobo struct
 ZarthaxX: but wonthave much time due to uni
 EnragedOxygen: I suppose there is no way to check your Pod Vector Velocity in a single iteration?
 EnragedOxygen: I'd like to check if my enemy is ahead of me, and that im prepared to ram him, but calculating my velocity over several turn seems to be such a drag.
 Willem640: how do you get your velocity?
 Willem640: is it silver or gold league data or do you have to keep static variables
 jacek: ohai
 struct: on gold they give you velocity
 Willem640: I see
 struct: and all checkpoints at start
 reCurse: Tracking velocity is very easy though
 EnragedOxygen: Its not hard, just boring.
 MadKnight: but it's not as long as tracking all checkpoints
 Pazkw: hello!
 Pazkw: is there a way to export the results?
 LoGos: maybe this will help <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app</a>
 MSPK: hey,can u pls share the code
 reCurse: No
 MSPK: please
 Pazkw: @LoGos thanks!
 Pazkw: however it does not seem to be working
 Pazkw: and I am not willing to go thorugh the code to understand why :grin:
 reCurse: It's working
 Pazkw: well I am selecting Coders Strike Back and putting my username 
 Pazkw: and I get Error 404. Player not found. Double check your nickname and the selected puzzle
 reCurse: Well read the full error
 reCurse: "Please note that cgstats can't find your ranking if you are above the first 1000 players."
 Pazkw: am I above the first 1k?
 reCurse: Well the translation kinda sucks
 reCurse: It means if your rank is below 1k
 reCurse: Or above 1k if you consider number
 Pazkw: my rank is well above 1k
 reCurse: In other words
 reCurse: It only works if you're in the top 1000
 Pazkw: aah
 Pazkw: I understood the exact opposite
 Pazkw: lol
 reCurse: Yeah the translation is bad
 Pazkw: thanks for the exlpanation
 Pazkw: still... any other way to export the data? I really don't want to parse the game output
 reCurse: What data do you want and why?
 Pazkw: I want position and velocity so that I can build a kinda model to predict the position/velocity of the craft and control it better using some optimal control technique
 Pazkw: it is boring to tune the feedback loop visually
 reCurse: Ah I see. cgstats won't help then.
 jacek: uncertainty principle tells you cant have both
 jacek: deal with it
 reCurse: You'll need to parse the data yourself
 Pazkw: :joy:
 MoMOElsharief: hello 
 Pazkw: I know, but I would like at least one o them!
 reCurse: Optimal control is also useless starting in gold league
 Pazkw: how else would you do it?
 reCurse: Good enough control
 reCurse: The game completely changes in gold league once you get two pods
 reCurse: You'll constantly have one enemy pod blocking yours
 reCurse: So the "optimal" trajectory will be extremely hard to compute
 Pazkw: cool
 Pazkw: well but first i need to get there
 reCurse: That's why I'm saying to focus on what's good enough and not overthink it
 reCurse: You definitely don't need to parse data to reach gold
 afert: pr
 fvla: one-line python list comprehensions are terrifying
 fvla: i need to relearn perl solely for clash of code code golf mode
 AntiSquid: no need to torture yourself
 fvla: the thing is, i did it once for fun
 fvla: i can do it again
 fvla: and make people reading my code suffer in idk
 fvla: i'm a terrible person
 Illedan: :pray:
 SilvanKohler: Is it allowed to connect to my pc with tcp and send the data to process on my pc?
 reCurse: No
 Illedan: Let me know if you are able to do it :D
 SilvanKohler: ok, nvm
 mark7: solved Mars Lander Ep. 2 with 100% and all 3 achievements  now I could sleep :joy:
 Astrobytes: good job mark7
 mark7: Astrobytes thanks&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: ah so you copypasted, gj
 mark7: what?
 Astrobytes: He's not a copypaster ZarthaxX of ZarthaxXia
 mark7: Astrobytes what is he talking about?
 Astrobytes: mark7 a lot of people copy/paste solutions from github. A LOT.
 Astrobytes: But I remember you trying real hard in the contest, so I think you're not a copy/paster
 mark7: mark7 no I didnt copy/pasted because if doesnt add any value knowledge to me
 mark7: working hard, sharpening brains make you smarter&#160;:-)
 607: охуеть
 mark7: Astrobytes :joy:
 AntiSquid: aren't schools still closed?
 reCurse: Reopening soon here
 EnragedOxygen: do you even need to use shields to pass Silver in Coders Strike Back?
 reCurse: You mean to get into gold or get into silver?
 EnragedOxygen: into gold 
 reCurse: You don't need shields
 reCurse: But it might help
 EnragedOxygen: Ramming is wonky without knowing enemies velocity. And trying to defend from accidental bumps slowls me down more times than it helps. Am i missing something aka a better raming algoritm?
 reCurse: Hmm I forgot the limited inputs
 reCurse: Yeah I guess you could totally ignore the shield
 AntiSquid: best tutorial for new users
 reCurse: What would you suggest
 Astrobytes: Perhaps introducing a (skippable of course) tutorial for a couple of other CG multis would work. Then again, it's probably too much work to update the old ones.
 AntiSquid: to not recommend the game
 reCurse: Great suggestion
 reCurse: How about an actual game you think would be better suited?
 AntiSquid: even WW would be better
 reCurse: lol
 Astrobytes: The only problem with CSB being the tutorial game is the change in Gold tbh. 
 Astrobytes: imo, before I get flamed
 MSmits: the problem with csb is that the input is inconsistent and people always come here and ask why their bot doesn't work. Then we have to tell them to reset their code
 MSmits: something you dont have to do with any other multi i know
 reCurse: I'd say you stop being a new user once you reach gold.
 Astrobytes: Depends how you get to gold tho
 MSmits: -pi vel?
 Astrobytes: just pi * vel, noob :P
 MSmits: ow right, for the circles
 Astrobytes: ofc
 AntiSquid: promoting from silver is full on kick in balls golden experience
 Astrobytes: But yeah, a lot of really green users do the MK formula and then just stop
 MSmits: they should really be referred to a simple board game
 Astrobytes: One size doesn't fit all
 AntiSquid: just don't promote csb . simple :D
 MSmits: I mean for simplicity. CSB is a dead end in gold
 MSmits: for new users
 AntiSquid: it has 90k dead accounts or so
 AntiSquid: maybe it's not a good idea to promote it
 Astrobytes: So there should be a couple of tutorials I think, of varying types of multi
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: well you can refer new users to codingame videos
 AntiSquid: on youtube channel
 reCurse: You keep saying to not promote it but fail at suggesting better
 Astrobytes: It won't happen anyway so we're debating pointlessly, but in the Ideal World...
 reCurse: WW is not easy at all to start with
 AntiSquid: i said even WW would be better, not that it's great
 AntiSquid: lol
 Amrhossam: i hate the reverse challenges
 MSmits: uttt has the regular uttt board to start with
 Astrobytes: *ttt
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: think its a pretty big jump to the 9x9, but its an ok start
 MSmits: tron works ok
 Astrobytes: Someone suggested just having a regular TTT for practising
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: You're comparing something that requires search
 reCurse: With something that requires intuition
 reCurse: CSB is just fine, the leagues are unfortunate but can't be fixed
 Astrobytes: Yes, fair point.
 MSmits: I know, but that's my point, once you get gold in csb you need to search to get any further.... if you're going to learn how to search, maybe csb is not the best place to start
 reCurse: Once you reach the top at any game you'll need to search
 reCurse: Your point?
 MSmits: my point is, suggest other games that they can learn the skills in more easily
 AntiSquid: uhm you need to track shit in csb silver and bronze
 reCurse: Yes the leagues are unfortunate
 AntiSquid: you can reach silver / bronze just as easy in most multis
 reCurse: If your onboarding requires search it's a shitty onboarding
 MSmits: yeah dont use search in onboarding
 MSmits: use q-learning
 AntiSquid: if your onboarding requires more trigo than programming it's a shitty one @_@
 reCurse: lol ok
 Astrobytes: Perhaps the CG redesign with the learning track thing will help with learning particular algos/techniques
 reCurse: Conversation with no purpose
 AntiSquid: lol ok back to you
 MSmits: yeah thats really what i was trying to get at. The transition from heuristics to search could use some streamlining on CG. 
 Astrobytes: Hopefully that's considered in the redesign. When it comes. If it comes.
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: And that leaderboard better not be indicative of the coming desing
 Astrobytes: *design
 MSmits: which one
 reCurse: Prepare to be mostly disappointed
 Astrobytes: The squished up one
 MSmits: is it still up?
 MSmits: i dont see it
 Astrobytes: Yeah reCurse, I'm not optimistic 
 Astrobytes: It seems to have been reverted (being Friday, always expect CG updates) but it's burned into my mind now
 reCurse: Uh? Do I need to refresh
 reCurse: Looks like it
 reCurse: Yay SPA
 MSmits: spa?
 reCurse: Single page application
 MSmits: o
 reCurse: Nothing refreshes for real
 reCurse: Until you do
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: I think it's time to submit csb
 Astrobytes: Right, so they've been seeing us moaning. So lets moan more.
 reCurse: Next step is to do machine learning to recognize wood bosses and have my personal DDoS tool
 reCurse: Don't ruin the fun and ask why
 reCurse: (joking in case)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I can't see the CSB submit issue being resolved anytime soon
 reCurse: I can guarantee doing that during a contest will get the issue addressed asap
 Astrobytes: It happened already tho' no? Was it UTG?
 reCurse: Yeah sort of
 reCurse: Would be 10x worse if deliberate
 Astrobytes: Then we need coordinated submits :P
 MSmits: They should at least have a button to stop all multiplayer activity in case of short contests
 Astrobytes: The multi AZ5
 MSmits: ah chernobyl
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: SCRAM/AZ5 isn't just limited to Chernobyl&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Killswitch, there.
 Astrobytes: Big Red Button on Thibaud's desktop.
 reCurse: Which creates a JIRA and assigns it to someone to do the killswitch
 Astrobytes: And 8 months later the issue appears as resolved in the bug channel on Discord
 reCurse: No for emergencies they are quite reactive
 reCurse: I just don't think Thibaud has the rights :P
 Astrobytes: True. lol, they should give him more power
 Astrobytes: Grrr. There's a bug in Tulips and Daisies. When I make changes I lose. Where do I report this.
 Astrobytes: It's clearly a conspiracy.
 reCurse: Your brain is staging a revolt?
 InsightNinja: E
 Astrobytes: I just miss our "the site is bugged my code doesn't work" users, so I'm projecting
 Astrobytes: That and I fucked up my eval again
 InsightNinja: EEE
 Astrobytes: Can you not do that please usaykurmoto
 Astrobytes: I think I remember that
 Astrobytes: how's it going inoryy?
 inoryy: aside from going crazy over sitting at home for 2 months? good good&#160;:)
 reCurse: You and me both
 Astrobytes: Tell me about it. 
 Astrobytes: Grim
 inoryy: more or less settled in, finished a mini-project today
 inoryy: excited to start the next one on monday
 Astrobytes: Nice. Anything interesting?
 Astrobytes: *particularly interesting 
 inoryy: I think so&#160;:) But probably won't be public for awhile
 AntiSquid: i am feeling fine, just taking a walk whenever it's sunny, shop something, go home, coworkers sound stressed though
 Astrobytes: hehe :spy:
 AntiSquid: inoryy when is there going to be a reveal about anything ML related from deepmind?
 Astrobytes: I've got loads of issues, mostly related to my Grandad, since most social care has evaporated
 Astrobytes: When they have finally taken over the world AntiSquid :P (joking)
 AntiSquid: how come? what happened to the social care?
 AntiSquid: what changed
 inoryy: AntiSquid what do you mean? we have publications coming out almost daily, sometimes with detailed blog posts&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: then i am bad at finding them
 inoryy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://deepmind.com/research">https://deepmind.com/research</a>
 AntiSquid: forgot that site
 AntiSquid: but is there anything major? like another game playing model&#160;?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid Social services (adult) washed their hands of him at the start of the pandemic. When I was isolating, the only way I could get food to him was via someone I haven't spoken to for 20+ years that lived nearby. Medical-wise, there's no podiatry, no diabetes clinic, no dermatology clinic. All we have is the care workers 4x a day
 AntiSquid: you know stuff that doesn't happen all the time
 inoryy: these two are quite major:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Towards-understanding-glasses-with-graph-neural-networks">https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Towards-understanding-glasses-with-graph-neural-networks</a>
 AntiSquid: so pink background = major, noted
 Astrobytes: Nice, the glass one looks very interesting
 AntiSquid: yes
 reCurse: Personally the development I've been the most impressed by is those imitating extremely complex physics at a fraction of the cost
 inoryy: yeah, it significantly outperforms current SOTA and has the potential to be beneficial in many science fields
 reCurse: That's just mind boggling to me
 inoryy: yeah that's the first link reCurse&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: don't remember seeing anything about graph neural networks before
 AntiSquid: might be old concept but new to me
 reCurse: I was thinking of something else
 inoryy: oh I think I know which one you mean
 inoryy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09405">https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09405</a>&#160;?
 reCurse: Yeah and there was another with an impressive video with floating capes and stuff
 AntiSquid: quick summary for graph netwroks please?
 reCurse: Trying to find it...
 InsightNinja: :apple:
 reCurse: I think it's this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/files/Deep-Cloth-paper.pdf">http://cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/files/Deep-Cloth-paper.pdf</a>
 reCurse: Or some followup
 Astrobytes: I'm a fan of the biological/biochemical applications too, protein-folding etc. Revolutionary.
 reCurse: Having a fixed compute for complex animation or physics is just insane
 inoryy: AntiSquid GNNs approximate graph structure via NN, typically through layers that work well with local spatial connectivity, e.g. convolutions
 Astrobytes: You have the link to the video for that reCurse?
 reCurse: I just noticed ubisoft contributed to that paper
 reCurse: So it's possible I'm referring to stop I actually saw internally lol
 reCurse: *stuff
 reCurse: oops
 inoryy: lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: Seems rather impressive
 reCurse: Makes no sense to me how well it works
 AntiSquid: so convolutional NNs are part of GNNs&#160;? i simply don't remember this term nor the visualization for it
 reCurse: Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg</a>
 reCurse: Not the best I've seen but it's something
 inoryy: conv is one simple approach to do GNNs but the novel results like glassy dynamics use specialized approaches with embeddings on vertex and edge level
 AntiSquid: i clicked a link in that article, shows a paper back from 2018&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Impressive
 Astrobytes: The GPU/CPU stats... lol
 Astrobytes: Very nice
 Astrobytes: *usage stats
 reCurse: Yeah it's ridiculous
 reCurse: When you compare to how much the ground truth costs
 Astrobytes: Indeed. Game changer. If you'll pardon the pun
 LayLay: ha

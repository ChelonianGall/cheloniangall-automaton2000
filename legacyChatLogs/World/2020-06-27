 eulerscheZahl: Happy Caturday
 code_maniac: You mean Saturday ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
 eulerscheZahl: wait for jacek and you will understand
 RedRook: what is the variable that dictates your pods orientation?
 abt8601: You mean in Coders Strike Back?
 emigr2k1: helo
 RedRook: ya
 abt8601: Then it is the target position in the output. The pod will try to turn towards the target position.
 RedRook: so there is no way to compare current orientation to nextCheckpointAngle?
 RedRook: or manually set current orientation?
 abt8601: Are you in gold league or legend league?
 RedRook: wood
 abt8601: If I remember correctly, you won't be able to know the current orientation.
 abt8601: Until you get to gold league.
 emigr2k1: helo
 RedRook: oh ok thanks
 emigr2k1: why do you guys not say hellolo back
 emigr2k1: hello
 abt8601: hello
 emigr2k1: hey
 RedRook: What dictates your rank? If the race course is randomized every time for each player?
 Tim_McSim: Hello!&#160;:)
 pardouin: you fight vs other players bots, you earn points when you win, especially vs higher ranked opponents, and you lose points when you lose, especially vs lower ranked opponents.
 Uljahn: yes, arena ranking is TrueSkill-based
 Reksio: which ones are arena?
 Reksio: bot or clash?
 adviceMe: If player doesn't share player's code, please banned to player. I hate this situation. Coding must be open source, free and funny. Not be competitive. Please!
 Uljahn: both
 Reksio: any other?
 Reksio: I feel like sharing code in arena makes no sense
 Reksio: but people who win should try to advise a bit without releasing a code
 Reksio: still not sure if this wouldn't make it too easy to go to the top
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Uljahn: Reksio: just search the forum
 Uljahn: kids these days are so accustomed to spoon-feeding, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: so we can have a look at my rank
 WINWINWIN: Slow response by you this time Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: how can i save the state of your bot in the arena
 jacek: AutomatonNN is faster
 AutomatonNN: you would need to say it is cause i am a real time
 jacek: indeed
 caubeloatchoat24: Anyone watch ICPC 2020 live :v
 SuperChamp: hi
 caubeloatchoat24: Virtual Event LoL
 Herdre: :biohazard:
 TheFlyingRubberDuck_a2dd: hi everyone
 TheFlyingRubberDuck_a2dd: ƒ± am new .&#160;:)
 TheFlyingRubberDuck_a2dd: This game  is better than codecombat.org
 jacek: which came
 dbdr: the codin game
 CodinGamerAK: do anyone knows here how to setup kaggle environment
 CodinGamerAK: if yes plz help me 
 kenyo: CoC taught me how succinct Python can be.
 Herdre: —Ç—ã –º–æ—ë –ø–æ–¥–º–æ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—å–µ
 Uljahn: #ru
 CodinGamerAK: #In

 jacek: ln?
 Astrobytes: dia
 jacek: its I not L?
 eulerscheZahl: i as in India
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 jacek: Lndia?
 eulerscheZahl: Linda, typo
 caubeloatchoat24: Anyone from India?
 jacek: #In
 WINWINWIN: Me
 tanmaycodernovice: @kayou bro please dm
 caubeloatchoat24: w do u mean?
 tanmaycodernovice: #kayou
 WINWINWIN: Not #kayou, its @kayou
 WINWINWIN: #kayou opens a chat channel
 tanmaycodernovice: yes i wanted to open the chat channel only 
 jacek: :o
 WINWINWIN: :P
 WINWINWIN: Anyway tanmaycodernovice, paste the code here or in the Indian chat and someone will explain
 tanmaycodernovice: how do u know, i wanted to ask about a code lol
 tanmaycodernovice: doing that on indian channel 
 jacek: he psychic
 CodinGamerAK: #World
 jacek: :thinking:
 Hjax: hello everyone 
 jacek: moshi moshi
 Hjax: now its time for another round of "lets try to make my MCTS faster"
 tanmaycodernovice: MCTS?
 Hjax: monte carlo tree search 
 Hjax: it spends 20% of its time masking off moves from the move gen 
 Hjax: 11% generating random numbers
 jacek: like int64 to vector&lt;Move&gt;?
 Hjax: int64 with a high bit for each valid move to int64 with just a high bit for the nth valid move 
 Hjax: apparently i can do that with one instruction when i port to C++ 
 Hjax: but java doesnt have an efficient way to do it as far as i can tell 
 darkhorse64: no pdep in Java&#160;?
 Hjax: no pedp in java&#160;:(
 Hjax: pdep* 
 jacek: why would you need pdep&#160;:?
 Hjax: it does exactly what i want 
 Hjax: src is 1 &lt;&lt; n, mask is my move gen long
 Hjax: output is a single move 
 darkhorse64: to random select one bit amongst one
 darkhorse64: *all*
 Hjax: your boss is so good darkhorse64
 Hjax: how many rollouts does it do?
 darkhorse64: 40k first turn
 Hjax: jeez 
 darkhorse64: *second*
 Hjax: well that explains why im getting rekt 
 Hjax: thats 4x faster than me 
 jacek: 40k in 150ms?
 Hjax: im doing 11k ish in 150 ms 
 jacek: in java eh
 Hjax: yes 
 jacek: not so bad
 Hjax: i occasionally lose to the garbage collector 
 darkhorse64: 40k in 150ms
 struct: I guess minimax Java could beat it
 Hjax: my selection / backprop is recursive, im not sure if thats inefficient 
 Hjax: but it was easier to write 
 darkhorse64: 500k for the first turn
 Hjax: i get 40k for the first turn, java needs to warm up 
 darkhorse64: Once recursive is working, reimplement using a stack
 jacek: well 1st move is just one move, reducing symmetry and rotation
 jacek: so if you tree reuse, you could use that
 Hjax: ah, is that a lot faster? or just more memory efficient 
 Hjax: to use a stack 
 Hjax: i dont do anything with rotations 
 Hjax: i do tree reuse, but it only gives me about 10% more effective speed 
 darkhorse64: a stack avoids the overhead of function calls. I cannot swear it makes a big difference
 Hjax: ill try it 
 jacek: depends how deep is your tree
 jacek: i doubt converting recusive calls to non-recursive would make much difference
 darkhorse64: 20 plies at least in the endgame
 jacek: noice, i can solve game in 11 plies
 jacek: that means game is decided mostly in middlegame
 darkhorse64: Yes, around move 30, I see my eval jumps from 50% to 5% in one move against the big guns. Game over
 darkhorse64: not jump, fall
 darkhorse64: a big cliff
 jacek: :shrug:
 darkhorse64: Time to look for an eval
 TheSpiffiest: When does checkers game end?
 TheSpiffiest: I saw it was game of the week, does that mean it goes away soon?
 Hjax: its not going away 
 TheSpiffiest: OK, cool. I have to paint my deck, but have more work to do.&#160;:)
 tutubalin: TheSpiffiest it's always on the site. game of the week just put it in a spotlight to attract more people
 jacek: youll need cg premium to get checkers
 jacek: *.*
 struct: Where can I get it?
 jacek: new accounts only. you need to delete this one
 Hjax: lol, i was going to say "its unlocked upon reaching legend in UTG" 
 darkhorse64: :laughing:
 struct: I'll do it later, pixi is currently killing me
 struct: When I saw that to change sprite color i need to remove it and draw it again
 struct: I almost quit
 dbdr: what are you working on struct?
 struct: Can't say
 struct: It's not chess though
 jacek: cheese?
 Hjax: its a multi? 
 dbdr: do you count chess 960 as chess?
 struct: yes and yes
 Hjax: you make multis so quickly
 Hjax: im not even done with othello yet 
 struct: making a multi is easier than to create an AI
 struct: wait that is wrong
 struct: Porting*
 struct: We need more people in wood 1
 Hjax: next time dont pick a boss that has solved the game 
 dbdr: :no_mouth:
 struct: Next time Ill make dbdr the boss
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 struct: The current boss would be last in the current league
 struct: Also it seems good to have competitive boss
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Hjax: it was all a ploy 
 Hjax: the boss checks the time 
 jacek: darkhorse64 you timeout a lot
 Hjax: it only unleashed its full strength yesterday 
 Hjax: :P
 jacek: we can check the real time? hmmmmm
 Hjax: dunno, id assume so 
 darkhorse64: I have a bug when multiple passes occurs. Which game(s)&#160;?

 dbdr: jacek, why not?
 jacek: dunno :v
 darkhorse64: Thanks, I can't seem to reproduce it in the ID. I have instrumented my code. Sorry for spamming the leaderboard. At  the same time, I cannot do any harm to anybody&#160;:-)
 dbdr: you do harm me darkhorse64&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: True; you lose points for winning against me. Wish me luck for my bug hunting
 dbdr: glhf!&#160;:)
 code_maniac: what is Caturday&#160;?
 jacek: everyday is Caturday
 Humble.Proletarian: How do I slide into DMs 
 Hjax: id recommend a running start 
 jacek: DMs?
 Hjax: direct messages 
 DoublyNegative: Lots of butter.
 Breachy: Humble.Proletarian please slide into mine
 Humble.Proletarian: Hjax, thank you for this insight
 Humble.Proletarian: Tbh I'm more of a WD40 than butter kind of guy
 DoublyNegative: I rate that.
 Humble.Proletarian: displacing all that water
 Breachy: a man of culture
 DoublyNegative: WD40 saved my trumpet valves.
 jacek: good for you
 caubeloatchoat24: heh do you guy know top 1&#160;?
 JBM: anything to do with top gun?
 caubeloatchoat24: just for fun bro&#160;? i actually things top 1 's bot too lol .
 Uljahn: top 1 in clashes?
 Uljahn: def not a bot, only 998 games played, bots have 44k+
 struct: But he can use a bot
 Uljahn: sure
 Uljahn: then his bot is good at captcha solving i guess
 struct: I don't get captchas from clashes
 struct: But I dont play them anymore so I cant be sure
 jacek: :cat:
 MSmits: :heart_eyes_cat:
 struct: MSmits we are waiting for you
 MSmits: ah yes, sorry, no time yet, will happen&#160;:)
 jacek: no sleep till get rid of NN e
 jacek: h
 MSmits: there is that yes
 MSmits: at least I have the power of reshuffling the top 3
 MSmits: I can pick who is nr 1, 2 and 3 in oware just by changing params
 MSmits: it just wont be me :P
 jacek: such responsibility
 dbdr: while (top[0].name&#160;!= "MSmits") reshuffle();
 jacek: its like death note
 MSmits: kinda
 MSmits: though, I am pretty sure if i make an opening book like you I can take the nr 1... its a lot of work though
 MSmits: meta mcts are complicated programs =/
 MSmits: or dorp out expansion thingy, whatever it is you use, its not easy
 MSmits: end game book was easier to make
 jacek: for oware is easy, no cycles or transpositions much
 MSmits: hmm, well there are cycles, but you can view them as separate states because the turn timer increases, you're closer to the last turn
 MSmits: so it's not technically the same state
 MSmits: transpositions would happen, but very rarely if you include the turn time as part of the state
 MSmits: my meta mcts programs are 2000 lines of C# and also have a 1k bot in C++ i adapted from my normal bot
 MSmits: so thats still a lot of code
 MSmits: I use the c++ program as a separate process that gets told what gamestate to simulate by the meta mcts program
 Tzak: pebis
 12944qwerty: how do you make your own clash with friends
 12944qwerty: nvm
 Ltrltrltr1234: join clash of code

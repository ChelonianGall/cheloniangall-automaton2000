 C26_1: Lol
 C26_1: I find a programmer who use import calender to calculate how many days in month and in years
 C26_1: Im such a dumb and stupid
 derjack: why
 C26_1: Because I don't know techonology
 BeatulTreaz: yeah google is 18 yo 
 C26_1: I mean people are inventing technologys everyday everytime and yet I'm don't know 99.99% one of those things that you can import directly in Python
 C26_1: Cmon, man
 C26_1: You can use import calendar to calculate days, given the month and the years in just many character
 BeatulTreaz: But then you don't learn the algorithm 
 C26_1: um, excuse me
 C26_1: I use else if to calculate the day according to month and year
 C26_1: and someone just use import calendar and bam get the result
 C26_1: I don't think i'm suited with this job tho
 C26_1: Because ya know tech
 Uljahn: python standard library is huge but possible to learn
 derjack: python is batteries included
 Uljahn: exactly, those are time saving
 BlaiseEbuth: C programmers code, and python programmers import what C programmers coded.
 struct: :scream:
 C26_1: hey
 C26_1: I know a little bit about pointers in C++
 C26_1: I know its very abstract
 BlaiseEbuth: it's not...
 C26_1: But c'mon, do you know your house's address
 C26_1: Yes, and you use it everyday it papers
 C26_1: Haizzz
 C26_1: But...
 C26_1: Teacher aren't teach that anyway
 BlaiseEbuth: Good teachers do.
 C26_1: Example:
 Uljahn: don't rely on teachers, learn it yourself
 C26_1: This is a spreadsheet about address of each house
 C26_1: @Ulijahn, yeah don't rely it, because in this "summer", I learn programming language more than my schools cold ever had to learn
 C26_1: could*
 struct: well when you learn by yourself you can focus on one thing
 struct: its harder to that if you are a teacher
 Uljahn: on the other hand teachers tend to give you systematic knowledge, not just excerpts from here and there
 C26_1: I don't know if programming knowledge will ever help me to become a police
 C26_1: BTW, in Vietnam, police wear green not blue
 Uljahn: :thinking:
 C26_1: blue is for protector in shops
 C26_1: Unless
 C26_1: You do some research on internet and capture some fraud
 C26_1: For example, if you ever want to clean http website. you can use your lnowledge to do that
 C26_1: knowledge*
 struct: im confused
 struct: Why did it go from programming to police
 C26_1: Do you know hobbyist
 struct: ah
 C26_1: Im sure that I'm hobbyist
 C26_1: Just learn for fun
 struct: so your hobby is programming
 struct: thats fine
 C26_1: Yea
 C26_1: wow
 C26_1: I find a player who write this code
 C26_1: t=input()print(<i>.join([x for x in t if x.isupper()]+['\n']+[x for x in t if x.islower()]))</i>
 C26_1: basically you take a input string and extract all upper letter in order and lower letter in order
 C26_1: My code is like this

 derjack: oh my
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah! Python has list comprehension! Hurray! \o/
 derjack: oO
 eulerscheZahl: t=input()s=[<i>,</i>]for c in t:s[c.isupper()]+=cprint(s[1]+'\n'+s[0])
 eulerscheZahl: that's shorter
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/874971207c8a53f1cebe8fc97799c4536824e6">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/874971207c8a53f1cebe8fc97799c4536824e6</a>to verify correctness
 eulerscheZahl: s=[<i>]*2</i>even 1 char less
 eulerscheZahl: and with inlined input()
 eulerscheZahl: s=[<i>]*2</i>for c in input():s[c.isupper()]+=cprint(s[1]+'\n'+s[0])
 derjack: you sound like someone who does clashes :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: no, then i would probably know some bash syntax
 eulerscheZahl: replacing c.isupper() by ord(c)&lt;90 cuts off another 2 chars
 eulerscheZahl: 91, otherwise Z would count as lower
 RoboStac: if you change it so s[0] is upper you can do "print(*s,sep='\n')" to save some as well
 eulerscheZahl: ah, right
 eulerscheZahl: we would have won the clash
 RoboStac: it sounds like no-one was utf'ing it anyway so it should have been easy to win
 eulerscheZahl: true
 eulerscheZahl: even now we are above the magic 50 chars limit
 C26_1: What the hell is this again
 C26_1: a=input()print(["loses","wins"][a==a[::-1]])
 C26_1: I don't know how to exaplin
 C26_1: explain
 C26_1: I'm in clash
 C26_1: Check if a number is palindrome
 eulerscheZahl: a[::-1] is the reverse
 eulerscheZahl: a==a[::-1] checks if it's the same in reverse
 eulerscheZahl: this will be 0 (different) or 1 (equal)
 eulerscheZahl: and that matches the array index
 C26_1: wow
 BlaiseEbuth: Thx eulerGle
 BlaiseEbuth: gooZahl
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerDoc
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;?
 C26_1: byebye
 eulerscheZahl: Ruby is shorter
 eulerscheZahl: looks like I could win some clashes if I would try

 eulerscheZahl: and not even a believable fake, considering that python uses snake_case and not camelCase
 BlaiseEbuth: You still have runned it... :3
 Uljahn: should be in line with isalpha() and isdigit() though
 eulerscheZahl: runned? fix your English
 BlaiseEbuth: No.

 PKX: thx
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh you mean, for an encoding function&#160;?
 PKX: yea
 PKX: btw i found the documentation
 BlaiseEbuth: You probably have to use utf8 and remove the trailing zero
 PKX: "The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)" it says
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. But in fact there's 8bits, with the first one always to 0.

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: can someone help me with "coders strike back"?
 Astrobytes: You again.
 eulerscheZahl: exactly my thoughts
 Astrobytes: Sometimes they just can't help themselves.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im just here for coding now, im not changed but im not gonna do the things i do 
 Astrobytes: Correct. Or I'll ban you again.
 mkkhell: what did he do
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: you banned me like 2 times before and i get it i'll code and ask for help
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: anyway, can someone help me with coders strike back?
 Astrobytes: No one will help you unless you ask about something specific.
 eulerscheZahl: and you were never banned, just kicked. otherwise you couldn't chat anymore
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: AI control of system program
 Astrobytes: No I banned his other account yesterday.
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: and mr.nomad too
 Astrobytes: Lucky I didn't ban you on sight today.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: can we get back on the road? 
 Astrobytes: The ball is in your court.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers:  how can i make a AI  system program

 Mr-S: pdf
 Mr-S: sds
 Mr-S: cccc
 Astrobytes: Stop it Mr-S
 eulerscheZahl: that's off the road
 eulerscheZahl: have i told you the flat tire story Astrobytes?
 BlaiseEbuth: If you can't see when you get off the road, don't drive...
 Astrobytes: No I don't think so eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: had a flat tire earlier this year, got it fixed at a local repair shop
 struct: I remember
 eulerscheZahl: then again a month later, told them to look for the cause
 KalamariKing: story time
 eulerscheZahl: then a 3rd time, got it to my brother in-law
 struct: bike tyre right?
 struct: tire*
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: now ya guys for the most part are getting off the road
 eulerscheZahl: the first 2 times did cost me 40€ each
 eulerscheZahl: the 3rd one costs me a pizza. that's why I have to leave now, see you
 struct: lol
 struct: cya
 eulerscheZahl: yes, bike tire
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 struct: Maybe ill move to germany to replace euler tire
 Astrobytes: For the pizza!
 struct: 40€ is the price of a premimum tire
 struct: premium*
 Astrobytes: Good point. I'd never pay that.
 struct: time to replace is 5 minutes max
 struct: at least for road cycling tires
 BlaiseEbuth: 40€ is the price of a premium pizza
 Astrobytes: I've always fixed my own over the years. Either repair, replace inner tube or tread, or a new one
 struct: oh yeah
 struct: He might not even have to need to replace the tire
 BlaiseEbuth: Patch it
 struct: Replacing the tire is rare
 BlaiseEbuth: ezpz
 struct: inner tubes are quite cheap
 Astrobytes: Yeah, usually when you've buckled it in some way 
 struct: like 4-5€ for decent quality
 Astrobytes: Yep. And it's easy to patch up if not too bad. Easy to find the puncture too.
 struct: i had punctures over 50km/h
 Astrobytes: I haven't had something like that since I was a teenager
 BlaiseEbuth: old time
 struct: Well I did triathlon, maybe ill go back into it again

 MiyamuraIzumi: hi
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am learning MCTS
 MiyamuraIzumi: for MCTS should we have score for draw
 struct: I think so
 struct: usually i do -1/0/1
 struct: lose, draw, win
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh
 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks
 struct: 0.0/0.5/1.0 also works
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am doing for UTTT
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 MiyamuraIzumi: my previous was 0/0.5/1.0
 Wontonimo: previous what?
 MiyamuraIzumi: but I am thinking about changing this rate
 MiyamuraIzumi: rate for win/draw/lose
 MiyamuraIzumi: score on MCTS
 Wontonimo: oh, you already have a strong UTTT bot
 Wontonimo: have you added solver to mcts?
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes, I do alot of optimize as you mentioned earlier
 struct: I dont think change 0/0.5/1.0 to -1/0/1 will have any different results
 MiyamuraIzumi: nope
 struct: try adding mcts solver
 MiyamuraIzumi: what is solver?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am still learning
 Wontonimo: i have a short memory, sorry MiyamuraIzumi
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes
 Wontonimo: are you familiar with negamax (a varient of minimax)&#160;?  It is fairly similar
 MiyamuraIzumi: I know about it
 Wontonimo: in that if you know for sure the opponent has a winning move, then your move is losing
 Wontonimo: and if you know for sure your opponent only has losing moves, then your move is winning
 Wontonimo: so, with that knowledge, you can change your backprop to send positive and negative infinity in those cases
 Wontonimo: and otherwise send 1/0/-1
 MiyamuraIzumi: so just add that, and it is a solver, right?
 Wontonimo: anything more than that struct?
 Wontonimo: that you can think of?
 jacek: i have flag solved in node
 Wontonimo: +1
 struct: yeah the difference is that I use a flag
 Wontonimo: i have a backprop function, and a backpropsolved function.
 Wontonimo: backprop is regular
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am still confuse
 Wontonimo: backpropsolved is only called if select gets an end state (or a solved state) and it does the solved backprop until it can't, then it calls backprop
 MiyamuraIzumi: do you have any link for this?
 Wontonimo: i don't have anything good
 MiyamuraIzumi: I search on gg, but not quite sure on which page that I can understand
 BlaiseEbuth: gg\o/
 jacek: that mcts solver paper? :scream:

 MiyamuraIzumi: a lot of text&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: reader gonna read
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank you all, I will research on this
 Wontonimo: my explanation is concise.  Use paper and pencil to go through some TTT end game moves while re-reading what I wrote and I'm confident it will click
 struct: Dont read the code
 struct: is the worst code ive seen
 Astrobytes: the paper itself is nice and clear though
 Wontonimo: another good background concept is negamax variant of minimax.  It is what solver is doing when the conditions are right
 Astrobytes: +1
 jacek: +inf

 Astrobytes: This is not a pony conversation.
 BlaiseEbuth: lasagna with a horn stay lasagna
 Astrobytes: Unicorns were natural enemies of the lion, the symbol that the English adopted
 BlaiseEbuth: "Naturak enemies"
 Wontonimo: don't play leapfrog with unicorns
 Astrobytes: Sound advice. Up there with yellow snow consumption.
 BlaiseEbuth: #ZappaKnown
 Astrobytes: Blaise is the Central Scrutiniser! :o
 Wontonimo: "don't accept wooden nickels from strangers" - I have questions, like why only not from strangers
 Astrobytes: Never heard it paired with "from strangers" tbh
 Wontonimo: and wouldn't a well crafted wooden nickel be more valuable than a real one with todays lumber prices?
 Astrobytes: Fair point.
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/GWBK8Lh">https://imgur.com/a/GWBK8Lh</a>
 Astrobytes: I approve.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: hows ya coding goin?
 Astrobytes: I actually had a conversation with a Brazilian yesterday about a fart-powered bagpipe.
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: That wasn't even the strangest part of the conversation.
 BlaiseEbuth: Fart will not be enough...
 BlaiseEbuth: What about decomposition gas? OO
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: ...
 Astrobytes: If you've ever been around me you'd know that the bag could be filled pretty quickly.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: and im gonna go back to drawing ponies and coding
 Astrobytes: Anyway this conversation is rapidly going downhill.
 BlaiseEbuth: Like a chopped head...
 Astrobytes: Your puzzle is puzzle of the week Blaise
 Astrobytes: congrats
 BlaiseEbuth: \o/
 Astrobytes: I haven't looked at it since it was in Contributions, maybe I'll do it tomorrow
 Westicles: Only one new published solution
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah!

 jacek: that sounds like a plan
 Astrobytes: Did you draw that scary bagpipe-monster BlaiseEbuth?
 Westicles: Someone needs to show zeno how to unpublish
 Astrobytes: where is Zeno anyway? I know I've been absent a fair bit recently but normally catch him once in a while
 Satyawashere: whats up
 Astrobytes: :point_up: that way
 Satyawashere: D:
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: nothin but drawin some art
 Satyawashere: bad joke
 Astrobytes: I didn't say it was funny.
 Satyawashere:&#160;:(
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: ooof
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im gonna code that coders strike back thing now
 MONIGMA: ok
 MONIGMA: I'm back
 MONIGMA: peoples
 Westicles: daniel?
 Westicles: I haven't been keeping up who was who
 eulerscheZahl: i'm back. did you also get the RAIC email Astrobytes?
 YurkovAS: i'm also received RAIC email and confirmed delivery again
 eulerscheZahl: was about to advice you to click "submit" again
 eulerscheZahl: last year kovi thought he had already ordered it and ignored the 2nd email. and received nothing
 eulerscheZahl: and I have a feeling that I'll get an M hoodie again&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: somehow they won't let me pick M for tshirts and L for hoodies
 YurkovAS: in delivery card info click (expand) "My deliveries" and in the list choose not filled prizes
 eulerscheZahl: i really struggle with this poorly translated site
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/zZTs2DF">https://imgur.com/a/zZTs2DF</a>
 YurkovAS: and change language in top right
 Astrobytes: Yes euler
 eulerscheZahl: the language selection doesn't translate everything
 eulerscheZahl: i have that list of deliveries. that YES is not a link
 Astrobytes: As YurkovAS says it's just to confirm your details are correct, so you can just click the button
 jacek: those russians eh
 YurkovAS: Prize columns is link
 eulerscheZahl: initially I ordered: tshirt in M, hoodie in L
 eulerscheZahl: now I opened both links again. And both sizes were L
 eulerscheZahl: so I saved the tshirt again as M
 Astrobytes: I can't do it twice as delivery is confirmed now, but if anything is different, change it then confirm
 eulerscheZahl: and tried to go back to the hoodie and save as L. But it's already ordered now that I saved the tshirt
 BlaiseEbuth: Found it in a youtube video Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Ahh, it's great :D
 eulerscheZahl: i never got to confirm the hoodie
 Westicles: they are just excited, first guy that isn't XXXXL
 eulerscheZahl: also: highloadcup, YurkovAS? did you like it?
 eulerscheZahl: I have the mini AI cup in my list
 eulerscheZahl: got emails about the highload but didn't look that interesting to me. almost like real work
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I checked a few of those out over the past while, didn't seem overly fun.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7339982be7cb46f22ef80f9c453cbca0e17d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7339982be7cb46f22ef80f9c453cbca0e17d</a>that last validator :D
 eulerscheZahl: Stilgart your turn
 Butanium: hi&#160;!
 Astrobytes: lol what
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: wanna get me banned?
 Stilgart: :D
 MH125: hi
 eulerscheZahl: i can ban you if you want&#160;;)
 struct: great clash
 struct: specially the last validator
 Stilgart: btw, abs (-2147483648) is -2147483648 assuming OP has a machine from the last millenium (ie 32bits integers)
 Astrobytes: It's certainly very... 'special'
 Westicles: There's also that one with special characters
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/732061ad47c5fad3e81616c4b9b24e2f8436">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/732061ad47c5fad3e81616c4b9b24e2f8436</a>
 Stilgart: at that time, people already knew that 2's complement was the thing to do
 YurkovAS: eulerscheZahl Short answer - yes. I'm like Highloadcup 2018, maybe because this is my first contest. And also solve 2017 - this is easy version of 2018. But last 2020 is was distinct, more similar to optimization problem: where i'm is not good.
 Westicles: Can all languages handle that now?
 Butanium: Guys I need your imagination, there are 2 contrib named "clash of bots". I accepted to add a subtitle to mine because the other author made a thesis in which he mentions the name. Do you have any idea of what subtitle would sound good&#160;? 😅
 struct: bots of clash
 Astrobytes: Bot Clash
 Butanium: I thought about "clash of bots&#160;: arena" but idk if it sounds good for people who really speak english
 eulerscheZahl: i remember there was a task on hacker.org that asked you for which input a given Java program would throw an exception. was also about abs(int.min)
 Butanium: I already have a banner that's why I want to add a subtitle
 Butanium: I'm lazy to make a new one x)
 Astrobytes: I think you might have to overcome the laziness&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: "Death First Search" is still free, somehow no one wanted to take it
 Astrobytes: :D
 Butanium: ahah
 eulerscheZahl: i also try to sell "Anonymous Algorithmics" for years
 eulerscheZahl: but would be better for a fog of war game
 eulerscheZahl: and if you don't like AA as the acronym, you can just take the first 2 letters of each word
 Astrobytes: *"Algorithmics Anonymous"
 Butanium: what's the play on word with anonymous algorithmics?
 eulerscheZahl: alan? like alan turing?
 eulerscheZahl: anonymous alcoholics?
 Astrobytes: Stop being German and doing it backwards!
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/71980557041b57ab49fcd374d3e804175be358">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/71980557041b57ab49fcd374d3e804175be358</a>
 Butanium: oh ok nice one x)
 eulerscheZahl: viewer died long ago after some breaking update
 Astrobytes: Alcoholics Anonymous, ALgorithmics ANonymous
 Astrobytes: I liked the concept
 YurkovAS: eulerscheZahl And HL-cup community maked new similar tasks platform: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://highload.fun">https://highload.fun</a>
 Butanium: well I think I'll go for either bots of clash or Bot Clash
 Butanium: bots of clash sounds a bit weird doesn't it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Astrobytes: Bot Wars? 
 Astrobytes: Battle Bots is most likely a copyright issue
 eulerscheZahl: gchebanov at #3i remember that nick. some cryptography background, solved nintendo with ease
 Astrobytes: Cool that the community made a platform for those tasks
 eulerscheZahl: but no D support
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: write the fastest code o.o
 eulerscheZahl: "Try to find the sum of these numbers for the shortest time. In case of an integer overflow, just ignore it."
 struct: but fastest time or fastest code?
 Illedan: hi
 Butanium: hi
 Astrobytes: Wording is a little ambiguous to say the least
 Astrobytes: Fix your FB Illedan
 Illedan: In submit
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Butanium: Bot wars or bot wars 🤔
 Butanium: *bot clash
 Astrobytes: Or Bot War (many clashes/battles == war), or War of the Bots, or Bots of War
 Astrobytes: Warbots
 Astrobytes: Wombles
 Astrobytes: I donno, be creative :D
 eulerscheZahl: finding a good title is hard
 eulerscheZahl: writing a statement too
 YurkovAS: Or current contest (1place prize $6.5k): top1 - Oleh Kuznetsov = Recar <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cups.mail.ru/ru/tasks/1103">https://cups.mail.ru/ru/tasks/1103</a>
 Astrobytes: (not Wombles though, that was a joke)
 Butanium: I was very happy with clash of bots x)
 Butanium: also I already have almost 1000 views on my contrib
 Butanium: so maybe I should just aadd a subtitle
 Butanium: so that player can still recognize it
 Astrobytes: Nice YurkovAS
 Butanium: "Clash of bots&#160;: ANNIHILATION"
 eulerscheZahl: too bad that yandex algorithms isn't as international anymore&#160;:(
 Butanium: I don't know if it really sounds good or not x)
 struct: YurkovAS on the site you linked we are supposed to write optimized code?
 Westicles: Just leave it as is
 Westicles: You had it first
 Astrobytes: They limited the Yandex one to Ru only?
 eulerscheZahl: the algorithms part (codejam-like) is free for everyone. but much less prizes (30 tshirts?) - used to be 512
 eulerscheZahl: there were optim contests too. those are Ru only now
 Astrobytes: Ah right. Yeah I'm familiar with the formats
 YurkovAS: struct yes in c++, rust or go.
 struct: ok
 struct: ill try to see how bad I am
 Illedan: Hmm, this seems to work :OUnless it crashes and burns soon
 struct: nice
 struct: which number did you change?
 Illedan: 0.25 =&gt; 0.1
 struct: not the answer I wanted
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Decay of a Genome from 1 iteration to the next
 struct: 0.1 =&gt; 0
 struct: rank 1
 struct: Does your bot do the accio trick Illedan?
 Illedan: trick?
 Illedan: Tell me more
 struct: carry a ball then use accio on another
 struct: ball will collide with the one you were carrying
 struct: causing massive boost
 Illedan: Sometimes
 Illedan: but I only sim 4 turns ahead, so sometimes my Accio throws the ball in the wrong direction :P
 struct: still nice improvement
 Illedan: This makes no sense
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i got my new pfp
 Illedan: but i accept it
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: also im done with coding in another web
 struct: now port it to c++
 struct: and get rank 1
 struct: or  wait even better
 struct: you dont need to use C++
 struct: C# has avx
 Butanium: A friend of mine gave me a good subtitle
 struct: :thinking:
 Butanium: Clash of bots&#160;: *explode another day*
 Astrobytes: I don't get it.
 lStevenmo: Hola
 darkhorse64: die another day, a James Bond movie
 Astrobytes: Oh. I can't stand James Bond movies. 
 struct: i barely can watch movies
 struct: I only enjoy tv shows now
 struct: movies feel too short
 Astrobytes: I try to minimise exposure to both these days.
 struct: ofc tv shows where most of episodes are fillers its a no go
 jacek: have you tried... anime
 struct: not really
 struct: do you jacek?
 jacek: maybe
 Westicles: Going to movies is awesome these days.  Nobody there but me
 Astrobytes: anyway, later everyone

 Wontonimo: are the kids behaving?  i see some graffiti on the walls here
 struct: well they did stop
 struct: after i asked them
 struct: no further action was needed
 Wontonimo: the emoji was almost in the shape of a G.  Perhaps a C before it would have been on-theme eh?

 Starting_Coder: Hey can the creators make the code blocks and have a see code button,so when we put blocks together we click see code and it shows the script?If so that would be easy.
 Starting_Coder: Hey can the creators make the code blocks and have a see code button,so when we put blocks together we click see code and it shows the script?If so that would be easy.

 Starting_Coder: Hey can the creators make the code blocks and have a see code button,so when we put blocks together we click see code and it shows the script?If so that would be easy.
 struct: I think you only need to ask once
 struct: you mean to compare code versions Starting_Coder?
 Starting_Coder: yes
 struct: usually I use vscode to check it
 struct: it has inbuilt tool for that
 struct: I guess you could suggest that feature on the forum
 Starting_Coder: like making them blocks then,Having a button that shows the script.
 struct: Wontonimo have you ever use mmap by any chance?
 Wontonimo: no.  i've used map
 Wontonimo: what's mmap?
 struct: its to optimize reading
 struct: not important on cg

 Wontonimo: oh, yeah there was something like this in CP/M 
 Wontonimo: that was OS based
 struct: what is CP/M?
 Wontonimo: not quite the same
 Wontonimo: an old operating system <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M</a>
 struct: oh
 struct: way older than me
 struct: :D
 Wontonimo: using the os you could specify a part of RAM "as a disk drive"
 struct: o.o
 Wontonimo: so, not quite the same but smells similar
 Wontonimo: man, that drive was FAST (as you could imagine)
 struct: for the time I would guess so
 struct: 16kb of ram
 struct: damn
 struct: cpus caches are bigger than that now
 Wontonimo: yeah, huge change
 Wontonimo: i guy i met at a coding meetup told me about how he optimized IO by prepacking the output data to be exactly the disk block write size
 Wontonimo: really reminds me of data-oriented design
 struct: wow
 struct: I dont think I can do anything close to that
 Wontonimo: what?  I see your UTTT bot and C4 bot.  That's some serious data-oriented design there to get that high
 struct: But it might be easier to do now
 struct: Than it was some years ago
 Wontonimo: C4 was much more recent right?
 struct: I think they have 1 month difference at most
 struct: it uses the same mcts
 struct: my bt, c4, uttt all use same mcts
 struct: the main difference on bt is that it is ept
 struct: maybe I can add some features to the mcts
 struct: that I havent fully implemented yet
 Wontonimo: i haven't tried BT yet
 struct: is quite hard
 struct: at least it was for me
 struct: mcts with solver was like top 30 at best
 Wontonimo: like what?  (wonto drops jaw thinking there is more than solver lol)
 struct: with full playout
 struct: if its a forced move, you dont backprop
 struct: but do expansion again
 struct: same if it was only 1 node expanded
 struct: small things
 Wontonimo: oh yeah
 struct: you can even check if opponent only has 1 move next turn
 struct: and expand again
 Wontonimo: where have you seen these?
 struct: the implementation?
 Wontonimo: the ideas?  was it in a mcts review paper?
 struct: no, I just thought of it when I was doing breakthrough
 struct: I wanted to handle zugzwang
 struct: and this way should cover it
 Wontonimo: i like these ideas
 Wontonimo: there was another one about doing all expands at once
 struct: I expand all every time and rollout all
 struct: in all games I think
 Wontonimo: and the handling is different than just regular backprop.  i don't remember
 struct: except on bt where I prune my moves
 Wontonimo: i tried the expand all rollouts for uttt.  didn't work as well
 struct: yeah its a hit or miss
 struct: msmits does only 1 rollout
 struct: me and darkhorse do all
 struct: we both are similar rank, me and darkhorse
 Wontonimo: i do 2 rollouts
 struct: hmm
 struct: the 2 best ones?
 Wontonimo: so, regular mcts, and when a rollout is supposed to happen, do a second one and backprop them
 struct: ah you do 2 rollouts for the same expanded node
 Wontonimo: yeah
 struct: It performs better?
 struct: or is it similar strength?
 Wontonimo: better for sure.  at least 1.5 truescore better
 Wontonimo: it was originally a stopgap because my select and expand was way too slow
 struct: do you know what your ndoe size is?
 Wontonimo: it's really small now
 struct: &lt; 32bytes?
 Wontonimo: 24 bytes
 Wontonimo: just checked
 struct: Its good then
 struct: My bt node is that size
 Wontonimo: it was giant before
 struct: yeah some people have &gt; 100 bytes on node
 struct: it doesnt help on selection
 Wontonimo: then after fixing it i forgot to remove the extra rollouts.  a couple days later while reviewing the code to try and find new ideas it was surprising to see it there.  i had forgotten about it
 struct: But not everyone needs performance
 Wontonimo: removed it and it performed worse
 struct: lol
 Wontonimo: tbh, i did reduced it from 3 down to 2 
 struct: I think I tried something similar on c4, but it performed worse
 struct: I even wrote my worst code to date to try doing selection with avx
 struct: It works but did not gain any performance
 Wontonimo: that's some dedication!
 Wontonimo: i considered trying that for 2 days, then thought maybe i should spend quality time with my dog instead
 struct: avx is worth but not for selection ofc
 struct: On c4 to check win and opponent winning moves
 struct: it helps a lot
 struct: But can be a bit tricky if you are not familiar with it
 Wontonimo: i saw lots of chat here about BT being special in-that finding long chains of that lead to a sure win is very important
 struct: yeah
 struct: I never implemented it successfully though 
 Wontonimo: ah.  do you remember the gist of any of the ideas?
 struct: Well its easy to see has a human
 struct: But I dont know how really code it
 struct: At least without it being expensive
 struct: I can currently check if its a win if I have a piece in 6th row and is my turn
 struct: inclunding multiple captures
 struct: if you are attacking a 7th row twice its a win
 Wontonimo: if only there was some way to get computers to see somewhat how humans see :smirk:
 struct: and if its your turn
 struct: This part I could code it
 struct: But I want to check on opponent turn
 struct: which makes it way harder
 Wontonimo: well, i think i'm just about burnt out of helping with CSB
 struct: can be hard
 Wontonimo: pretty tired of being asked crazy personal questions after helping someone with how to use sqrt
 struct:&#160;:/
 struct: are the questions that bad?

 WickedExistence: I have and arrayList&lt;CustomClass&gt; xwhen i call x.get(0) on this array it returns ArrayList&lt;CustomClass&gt; instead of CustomClass
 WickedExistence: Java
 WickedExistence: I don't get it, shouldn't get return me the element? the CustomClass?
 Mortis_666: can you show the code?
 WickedExistence: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/uUvqGsO">https://imgur.com/a/uUvqGsO</a>
 WickedExistence: line 55 throwsThe method dist(Coordinates) is undefined for the type ArrayList&lt;Coordinates&gt;Java(67108964)
 WickedExistence: but I'm passing Coordinates :D
 Mortis_666: WickedExistence "humans" its still an array list u need to add Coordinates human = humans.get(i)
 WickedExistence: my god, I feel stupid
 WickedExistence: thx a lot
 Mortis_666: np ðŸ¤—
 isimkullanmiyorum: hello
 Ezuker: helo
 Xenia6502: Hi
 ycsvenom: the MCxxxx is really epic puzzlei will some adjustments to my solution and it will be a programming language  :grimacing:
 derjack: noice
 c-mate: Any way I can play the pro escape rooms as an individual?
 c-mate: I'd be willing to pay for it
 5DN1L: [CG]Thibaud Are pro escape rooms only availble for a person with a business email only?
 5DN1L: available*
 Aya_Noaman: hi guys
 Ajaiy: 5DN1L: I am not sure about that, but I think CodinGame for Work uses a pro account, which may be needed for the pro rooms.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/pricing/">https://www.codingame.com/work/pricing/</a>
 5DN1L: the above was what Thibaud previously mentioned on Discord, not sure whether anything has since been changed or not
 Ajaiy: oh okay
 quefro: Hello guys
 quefro: Im getting the correct output but it says "player timed out, expected  3 lines"
 quefro: Is this performance related?
 therealbeef: or a crash
 quefro: I can see my output tho, and it is what it should be
 therealbeef: 3 lines?
 quefro: Yep
 therealbeef: didn't forget endlines?
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: therealbeef
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: thumbs up for playing topcoder
 quefro: End line?
 eulerscheZahl: \n
 quefro: Oh no no. I can see the output: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4756a47e-5a34-4d50-97b7-2cc9e4b81b8e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4756a47e-5a34-4d50-97b7-2cc9e4b81b8e</a>
 coconutjuiceisgood: how can i change problem difficulty?
 coconutjuiceisgood: the problem on clash of code is too easy
 Mortis_666: try puzzles
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: help me i dont know how to code
 Mortis_666: coconutjuiceisgood <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: can someone help me leard how to code plz
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: learn
 eulerscheZahl: if it's  still too easy, try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>

 eulerscheZahl: did you ever read the tizk manual?
 eulerscheZahl:  The idea is that you, ashuman (or you, as a machine, if you happen to be a machine and happen to be reading this document) justspecify which nodes are present in a graph and which edges are present.
 therealbeef: thanks&#160;:) congrats on (probably) winning the topcoder MM134 eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, but let's not celebrate too early
 eulerscheZahl: i think i got it (iehn shared the code, ran his vs mine offline on 1000 seeds)
 eulerscheZahl: iehn.txt 981.5530653588468v21.txt 987.3849897935605
 therealbeef: you only looked one move ahead, without path planning?
 therealbeef: on seed 23 for example the only barn is inside a 'cave' of trees that is not easy to reach without path planning
 eulerscheZahl: i do a BFS to compute the distance from each sheep and each barn to every other cell
 eulerscheZahl: watching my bot play: farmers have a hard time to find the entrance, when a sheep is blocking it
 eulerscheZahl: still 326 in score
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: hey guys
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: i dont really know how to code
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: could you guys point me in the right direction?
 eulerscheZahl: me neither. but 5 years in and the other users still haven't caught on
 eulerscheZahl: others recommend code academy if you are completely new to coding (i haven't tried the site myself). for codingame you should at least know the basics
 eulerscheZahl: so get comfortable with the basics first (conditions, loops, arrays), then come back
 JackSepticEyeSpeedISkey: ok i know some stuff but not everything
 eulerscheZahl: some should be enough to have fun and improve here on CodinGame
 eulerscheZahl: but hard to give an answer to such a broad question
 therealbeef: ah, the BFS is bit like dijkstra's algorithm I guess
 eulerscheZahl: on a grid with every edge having the same distance it's basically the same, just easier to implement
 eulerscheZahl: and C# lacks a priority queue in Collections.Generic&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i see the point if siman doing it, as he didn't consider a sheep as a total block but as an increased distance
 eulerscheZahl: pretty cool idea actually
 eulerscheZahl: i tried seeing all sheep at higher dist as void cells and closer ones as blocks, didn't work at all. just now that i'm typing i realize my mistake in this one
 eulerscheZahl: of course i wanted to consider the distance to my farmer. but i started the BFS from each sheep. so i checked how far from other sheep my target is. total nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: siman definitely had some interesting ideas. iehn's code is sadly hard to read, using only 2-3 letters for variable names
 eulerscheZahl: like what does any of this mean?double BW[BWM][MAX_B], TBW[MAX_B], UBW[MAX_B], SBW[MAX_B];
 struct: you dont code with your caps lock on?
 dbdr: BlackWhite, TopBlackWhite, UltraBlackWhite, SuperBlackWhite
 dbdr: it gets better and better
 eulerscheZahl: and BWM is a BMW with a typo?
 dbdr: Bayerische Werke Motoren
 a-Rye: The best site I've found for learning to code is freecodecamp.com. Codecademy is good, until you hit the pay wall. Then there's my codepen site I'm working on for beginners at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codepen.io/A-Rye719/full/wvqvEwm">https://codepen.io/A-Rye719/full/wvqvEwm</a>. My Java section is good to go (for beginners) and finishing my Python section soon. But joining the live streams and asking questions is a quick way to learn too. 
 dimp: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".What is the limit?
 Uljahn: something like 25 submits in 5 hours
 dimp: okay :disappointed: Enough testing for tonight then... Thanks
 Ajaiy: dimp: You have to wait for 4-5 minutes, then maybe you can submit again
 Ajaiy: It had worked for me 
 dimp: ok, will try
 jacek: addict eh
 KrishnaKumarAnbalagan: hi all
 KrishnaKumarAnbalagan: i m new here!
 KrishnaKumarAnbalagan: i like the challenges here but the time constraint is tricky
 KrishnaKumarAnbalagan: is there any site have no timing constraint?
 5DN1L: there are untimed puzzles here
 5DN1L: anything other than clash of code and timed contests are untimed
 5DN1L: check out the ACTIVITIES
 5DN1L: menu on the top
 5DN1L: (or on the left depending your browser)
 KrishnaKumarAnbalagan: oh great thanks
 PainEXE: Hi 5DN1L can you check my contribution and check what the most recent guy is trying to say?  Thanks for the help (my old name was AlmightyDab)
 PainEXE: Thanks for the help
 5DN1L: yw
 Westicles: it is easy to solve with eval and there are a ton of problems like it, but otherwise is fine
 AdemDj12: take taco
 Westicles: I'm not sure if the tacos are ever coming back
 AdemDj12: no eveRYTHING BUT TACOS
 NSMinecraftBusst: 1
 cagriy: hi from istanbul
 Serge_Billault: For puzzles, is the code we provide for solutions in C++ compiled in release with optimizations enabled&#160;?
 Westicles: no optimizations
 Westicles: you can do it yourself with pragmas
 a-Rye: @KrishnaKumarAnbalagan you can try Code Wars! But once you get used to the time limit, the clashes here are more fun in my opinion
 Red_hats: once i start a new mission on THE SAME level how to i get the game to not code the previous one????
 Red_hats: once i start a new mission on THE SAME level how to i get the game to not code the previous one????
 jacek: huh
 Red_hats: /me
 Red_hats: once i start the secend part on a practice mission called the descent once i am done with the first part and want to start the secend part the game will just read the one i typed before
 Red_hats: what do i do???
 5DN1L: Please do not repeat yourself and flood the chat.
 5DN1L: And I don't understand your problem at all.
 Synergyforge: LUL
 Westicles: this is always a tough one to answer.  I think he is trying to solve the tests one by one instead of writing a program
 Synergyforge: Hard-coding&#160;!= programming.&#160;:)
 5DN1L: Ah your interpretation makes more sense to me, Westicles
 Synergyforge: Where my motorcycle riders at? :D
 Synergyforge: None?&#160;:(
 a-Rye: I don't trust myself to them, but I come from a long line of riders!
 Husoski: @Synergyforge I still have my class-M license, but haven't used it in many years.
 Synergyforge: @Husoski: WHYYYY?!  It's one of the best mental health boosters I can think of! :D

 Hjax: if the sum is always 4, just subtract 4 and now its a zero sum game?
 Hjax: i dont get it 
 eulerscheZahl: zero sum game: score gain for you equals score loss for opponentnot sure if that's what's meant
 eulerscheZahl: and of course you can write a minimax for a zero sum game
 WINWINWIN: Understood, thanks Hjax just need to subtract constant sum from the score to make it a zero sum game
 WINWINWIN: In struct`s othello referee:
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MultiStruct/Othello/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/othello/Board.java">https://github.com/MultiStruct/Othello/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/othello/Board.java</a>
 WINWINWIN: from lines 69 onwards,
 WINWINWIN: why is origins a list? isnt there only 1 origin? or do flips cause new flips?
 pb4: "WINWINWIN 05H40Anyone, when you are writing a minimax, it just needs to be a constant sum, not a zero sum right?"
 pb4: Ideally it also needs to be sequential instead of simultaneous
 WINWINWIN: So that you can minimize/maximize to backpropogate in sequence?
 jacek: good morning
 LelouchVC2: Good night
 PaulMorphy: good midday
 WINWINWIN: Hi all
 KhanhSB: hi all
 BPAle: good evening
 natsudragneel_x: :heart_eyes:
 natsudragneel_x: :nerd:
 natsudragneel_x: :upside_down:
 struct: WINWINWIN its a lsit because before I coded I thought there were chains
 struct: Also I would not use the referee as a reference for the bot
 struct: Game should be simple enough
 jacek: its quite simple without the chains
 Nicolas.ElFegir: I everyone, can someone help me to solve sudokku validator with a simple algorithm&#160;? thanks&#160;!
 Val.thlt: yes me too pls. we need u!
 jacek: huh
 SamyErd: Jacek don't laugh

 Hjax: good morning
 reCurse: :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: :wave:
 mikiyas: hay
 Hjax: i managed to climb to rank 12 in pr2 last night, a day too late to improve my contest standing 
 Hjax: but im pretty satisfied with that rank, so thats enough pr2 for me 
 eulerscheZahl: oh, thanks for pushing me with your submit&#160;:)
 Hjax: my new submit 5-0d fpscube and 5-1d supermassive
 Hjax: i dont think it did spectacularly vs you 
 Hjax: yeah 2-3 vs you 
 Hjax: im surprised im the highest python 3 
 Hjax: having built in munkres was very convenient 
 struct: hi
 Hjax: hi struct
 Astrobytes: hi 
 Astrobytes: hey struct, Othello isn't random enough.
 Hjax: hi Astrobytes
 wlesavo: hi
 struct: I read
 struct: I don't know what is troll or not anymore
 Astrobytes: grats on your PR2 Hjax&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: flip 1 stone every 5 turns by random struct
 Hjax: too many hi's D: 
 Hjax: thanks :D 
 Astrobytes: I'm just struggling to understand what the coffee cup wants struct
 sirsatan: hello o/
 struct: he wants me to give moves in random order
 struct: so they are not always  in the same order
 struct: ...
 Astrobytes: What's that got to do with anything?
 wlesavo: i gave up and started to learn some cpp for uttt, almost got legend 
 eulerscheZahl: shuffle the list of possible actions :D
 struct: ^
 Hjax: hes complaining that bots that play the first legal move they see always plays the same move Astrobytes
 reCurse: Remove the list of legal moves, problem solved
 Astrobytes: I explained why this happens in the thread... so... 
 eulerscheZahl: TL;DR
 reCurse: Such a weird detail to get hung up on though
 Astrobytes: Remove the actions struct, and the rules
 struct: soon I remove othello
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure who's trolling and who isn't
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: TBali: definitely kidding
 eulerscheZahl: but the java coffee cup: no idea
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's right on his humour
 Astrobytes: It's one of the most peculiar 'issues' I've seen recently
 struct: Also I added the moves made by the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: breaking change or new protocol?
 struct: new protocol
 Astrobytes: Wait for "the last opponent move makes it too easy to counter his move" next 
 Hjax: dont give them ideas Astrobytes
 Than_Lan_Con: hello world
 Astrobytes: sorry :D
 eulerscheZahl: TBali is typing again
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: beat me to the popcorn
 Astrobytes: meh, that wasn't worth waiting for&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Anyway, catch you all later. Off for my MRI scan soon
 distro104: Hii everyone!! XD
 Hjax: hi
 Than_Lan_Con: Python in fast game =)) LOL
 Than_Lan_Con: not fair
 Hjax:&#160;? Than_Lan_Con
 Uljahn: typical CoC whining
 eulerscheZahl: choose the right tool for your problem. you are free to code in Python too
 Than_Lan_Con: in shortest game
 Hjax: oh clash
 Hjax: python is usually not at the top of the code golf leaderboards 
 Than_Lan_Con: when you write 100 lines in js and python just need 1
 Hjax: javascript also frequently beats python on code golf leaderboards
 Hjax: doesnt seem like a language issue to me, you just need more practice golfing 
 Than_Lan_Con: but it sort
 Than_Lan_Con: but itsort
 Edjy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pixelcanvas.io/@11144,30">https://pixelcanvas.io/@11144,30</a>
 wlesavo: js also have .sort()
 eulerscheZahl: did you draw that CG logo pixel by pixel? :o
 mikiyas: hey guys how can i share my score 
 Edjy: yes i drew it myself
 struct: looks good
 mikiyas: hey guys i have finished sky-net revolution episode-1 so how can i share the link 
 eulerscheZahl: link to what?
 mikiyas: to my score maybe that shows i have completed this game
 struct: Should be in your profile
 struct: that you completed it
 eulerscheZahl: make a screenshot and share that :D
 jacek: struct what if opponent has 2 moves?
 struct: both are given
 struct: split by&#160;;
 struct: also you will get passes
 mikiyas: OK its an assignment for data-structural and algorithm course. he told us to send him the link 
 jacek: wouldnt be that in achievements?
 eulerscheZahl: how do you pass jacek @struct?
 eulerscheZahl: can i get my own jacek?
 struct: pass is not a choice
 struct: Player is forced to pass and his turn will be skipped
 struct: also there is no frame for the pass
 darkhorse64: two separate&#160;;;&#160;? or a special keyword
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Scarfield: either more than one action or no action i guess=
 struct: a5;a6;a7;
 WINWINWIN: In minimax, the method only evaluates the nodes. How do you find which node was the highest scoring?
 struct: one action == a5;
 Hjax: im not sure i understand your question WINWINWIN
 darkhorse64: what if your opponent skips a move&#160;? You receive a ";"&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Minimax uses recursion to score the nodes,
 WINWINWIN: How do you identify which node at the first level was the best?
 struct: no you receive pass;
 WINWINWIN: Do you store all of the scores and nodes in an array
 WINWINWIN:&#160;?
 Scarfield: the nodes in the tree represents the series of actions made, you apply the actions to a game state, and eval that
 struct: sorry i did not udnerstand the question at first darkhorse
 Hjax: @WINWINWIN either that or you just implement the root level of the search differently 
 Hjax: if you have a transposition table you can look up the scores for the roots children and do it that way 
 Hjax: thats what i usually do 
 WINWINWIN: Can anyone send me a link to learn transposition tables?
 darkhorse64: Great&#160;! You should put that in the statement. If your opponent skips a move, you receive "pass;". If you skip several moves, you will as many moves from your opponent
 darkhorse64: *will receive*
 Hjax: they are pretty simple WINWINWIN, just keep a map of moves to scores, update it during your search, if a move is already in the table during your search, you can just return the value from the table instead of doing the recursive call 
 Hjax: heres a link anyway <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table</a>
 WINWINWIN: I see, so it aids in pruning?
 WINWINWIN: as well
 Hjax: yes, because if youve already searched a position in one part of the tree 
 Hjax: you dont need to search it again 
 Hjax: you already know the score
 WINWINWIN: Dont think that it would make too much of a difference to me, my evaluation function is pretty simple
 Scarfield: "if a move is already..." it should be if a game state is already in the table?
 WINWINWIN: Yes, if a game state is already in the table
 Hjax: uh, yeah i phrased that poorly 
 Hjax: in games with lots of transpositions (like chess) the table is a massive speedup 
 Hjax: also lets you do iterative deepening and get more cutoffs
 Scarfield: still havent tried making use of it myself yet, but thanks for the link&#160;:)
 jacek: dont bother with TT for now, until you get working minimax and alpha beta
 Password12345: i wanna die
 Hjax: the chess programming wiki is a great resource 
 Hjax: lots of cool stuff on there
 Hjax: but yeah, its an enhancement to an already working search 
 Hjax: so make sure your minimax/ab is solid first 
 WINWINWIN: Hmm I finished, but the best action is always None or null
 WINWINWIN: anyone else faced this error while starting out?
 struct: In what game are you trying?
 WINWINWIN: othello
 struct: Does this also happen on low depths?
 jacek: of course. the only winning move is not to play
 WINWINWIN: I am just starting out with a depth of 2
 WINWINWIN: I run the minimax function and take the best move, it is always None
 jacek: so its a bug in your code
 jacek: is it python? does your minimax returns something?
 WINWINWIN: Python
 WINWINWIN: it returns the score
 WINWINWIN: But on the final depth level, I give the best action as well
 WINWINWIN: if depth == DEPTH:
 Uljahn: eww
 MostComplicatedUsername: Hmmm I need to figure out a way to not self destruct in hypersonic
 Alshock: simulations?
 darkhorse64: make a sim: bomb + move, move, wait. At each turn, compute whether a bomb can blow you up
 Alshock: is a multi-agent MCTS a viable way to Hypersonic?
 darkhorse64: This probably won't get you to Legend but will sure get you to Silver
 Nickname_XD: hi anyone
 darkhorse64: There is lot of info in the PM. I do not remember people using that
 Hjax: so i was looking at C4L and i dont get it 
 Hjax: what makes the game strategically deep
 eulerscheZahl: what molecules to pick
 Scarfield: havent looked at it, but it has shared resourses i think
 eulerscheZahl: you can try to block your opponent
 eulerscheZahl: reach the MOLECULES station before the opponent to get a headstart
 eulerscheZahl: but there's also lots of randomness involved
 eulerscheZahl: Alshock to a large degree hypersonic is optimizing your own path to blow up as many boxes as possible. opponent prediction is very unreliable
 Hjax: so you just try to take molecules your opponent needs while completing your own samples?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Hjax: kind of a weird game 
 eulerscheZahl: but looking at the leaderboard it has some depth. otherwise agade wouldn't be that high above us
 jrke: I wanna learn GA can anyone tell me how can i begin
 Alshock: @eulerscheZahl TYSM I think you saved me from overthinking the problem before making anything viable
 Alshock: well "saved me" might be an overestimation though, no one can save me from wasting time doing stupid stuff :p
 eulerscheZahl: if you have fun and learn something on the way, it's not wasted time
 Alshock: "time you enjoy wasting is never wasted"
 Alshock: I don't remember who said that
 tomatoes: dog
 MostComplicatedUsername: I agree completely alshock :D
 Hjax: tomatoes your profile is incredible btw 
 Hjax: quality memes 
 tomatoes: :blush:
 Alshock: OMG a tomato Umaru-chan! xD I didn't even know that meme
 Reksio: "time you enjoy wasting is never wasted" I think it 's only true for people who have no regrets afterwards.
 wlesavo: yay uttt legend
 eulerscheZahl: congrats. that one was a nightmare
 eulerscheZahl: no python i guess
 wlesavo: my first ever cpp programm :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: really? :o
 eulerscheZahl: no hello world in university?
 wlesavo: hello world in c
 wlesavo: well i writed some test programms while try uttt to test some stuff
 wlesavo: many helpful ideas from ru though, last week was almost all about uttt
 eulerscheZahl: was amurushkin active on the chat?
 wlesavo: yeah
 wlesavo: also MelnikovIgor got legend with c# this week
 eulerscheZahl: i failed that :D
 eulerscheZahl: C++ for the final improvement
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 wlesavo: i actually really liked c++, a little bit more stuff to keep in mind but so convinient
 wlesavo: good thing i didn't start with it though
 Astrobytes: congrats wlesavo
 wlesavo: thx astro
 eulerscheZahl: will we see you in C++ again?
 eulerscheZahl: i only use it when i really need the speed. like for bulls and cows :rage:
 wlesavo: i plan to try some other games now, yeah
 wlesavo: lul
 wlesavo: actually that should be on the list
 eulerscheZahl: oh, BrainSolver took the lead there
 wlesavo: oh wow, solid lead over dbdr :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i decided to spam 4 more submits: 310, 314, 314, 328&#160;:(
 dbdr: solid lead? :D
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you got destroyed
 eulerscheZahl: completely crushed
 eulerscheZahl: or rekt, as a certain Russian would call it
 dbdr: rek't in proper english
 dbdr: I'l have to retaliate somewhere...
 wlesavo: wait till westicles will submit in NS
 eulerscheZahl: :imp:
 eulerscheZahl: he reported a bug that will occur around lvl700
 dbdr: last time he did I caught up pretty fast
 dbdr: but if he's been running for 3 months...
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl how did he find that bug?
 eulerscheZahl: by reaching the level i guess
 dbdr: really? that sounds strange not to submit
 eulerscheZahl: exceeding 600 frames =&gt; referee crashes thanks to CG SDK
 eulerscheZahl: so i read 2 lines at once now
 dbdr: does that work if the number of lines is odd?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we are just trolling you. you will know in 3 months
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i only read 2 lines at once, when there are &gt; 2 number remaining
 eulerscheZahl: i saw that question coming :D
 dbdr: clever&#160;;)
 dbdr: I think I uncovered the troll
 Alshock: then give him his undies back
 wlesavo: maybe he is a bit afraid that you will get 1000 faster than him if he submits, otherwise #1 would be unreachable
 dbdr: what's with the fixation on troll underwear?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it might crash again at 999 already. you get a level 1000 but can't submit the result
 dbdr: :D
 wlesavo: so we will know if he will report that bug :slight_smile:
 dbdr: I think I'll have to do a new optim to compensate for losing B&amp;C
 eulerscheZahl: "do" = play or create?
 wlesavo: SR?
 dbdr: play
 Reksio: Do anyone know if CG uses .net core? If so which version is it?
 dbdr: wlesavo what did you find convenient about C++?
 wlesavo: pointers and memory stuff
 dbdr: Reksio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>though I'm not sure it's up to date

 darkhorse64: Golfed Othello
 Astrobytes: Golfello
 darkhorse64: I have tripled my rollout count but it's hardly better
 Astrobytes: Time to get creative&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: Time to put a brain in the vehicle
 Hjax: i still think it would be fun to do an unofficial contest with a code length limitation
 Hjax: who can make the best bot in under 1000 characters 
 Hjax: but it would be hard to police 
 dbdr: just ask for a bot that prints its source code
 dbdr: the referee compiles it
 Astrobytes: A quine competition?
 dbdr: well, I don't the the referee can check that since it does not get the source
 Hjax: i was thinking the competition could involve uploading your submission, and it would run a game with the ref and compare to a replay on codingame
 Hjax: and ensure that the outputs are the same 
 dbdr: void main() {
 Astrobytes: ah
 dbdr: I guess you should print what language it is in first&#160;:)
 dbdr: or just impose a language
 Hjax: a site i used to compete on that doesnt exist anymore had a 1000 character mode 
 Hjax: people would compress their code with zlib, and then decompress and exec it at runtime 
 Andrelamus: Is there a way to never enter shortest mode?
 Andrelamus: Other than going out?
 Hjax: in clash? you cant pick what kind of clash you get
 Nerchio: the only way to win clash is not to play at all
 DiL: shortest mode are the funniest!
 Astrobytes: ^
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGNZnfKYnU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGNZnfKYnU</a>
 Astrobytes: (pointing at Nerchio's comment)
 Nerchio: o Astrobytes i see you like shortest clash let me invite you to one
 Astrobytes: :P
 Hjax: i love how clash is something people use to threaten each other 
 Astrobytes: lol, very true
 Hjax: youre back from your MRI? 
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Was... an interesting experience
 Astrobytes: Gotta try everything once right?
 Hjax: did they give you a drug to make you sleepy? last time i had an MRI they gave me something weird 
 Hjax: it literally made time feel like it was going by faster
 LelouchVC2: There's plenty of drugs that make you sleep
 Astrobytes: Nah they didn't give me anything, was only 40 minutes or so. How long was your one?
 LelouchVC2: Some even make you never wake up
 Hjax: probably about the same
 Astrobytes: Damn, your one sounds more fun
 Hjax: the drug didnt make me fall asleep though, it just slowed me down / made time seem to pass quickly 
 Hjax: i guess it helps you sit still
 Astrobytes: After about 5 minutes I entered a kind of Zen-trance, then about halfway  through I think I reached electromagnetic nirvana or something, was almost relaxing
 Astrobytes: :d
 Hjax: maybe they only gave me the drug because i was a kid, i was probably 12 or so at the time?
 Hjax: i used to get really bad migranes when i was younger, fortunately i grew out of them 
 Astrobytes: Ah, possible. My nephew had to get one around age 5, they tried 5 or 6 times but it was too traumatic for him to complete
 Astrobytes: Surprised they didn't give him a sedative
 Astrobytes: Yeah, my mate had that as a kid, same kinda thing, grew out of it
 LelouchVC2: I grew into mine&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Migraines suck. I have another friend who gets cluster headaches, thank christ I don't suffer with those
 LelouchVC2: ikr&#160;;-; only happens a couple times a year, so it's fine&#160;:/
 Hjax: oh ive heard of those, apparently they put migraines to shame 
 Astrobytes: And how.
 Hjax: when i got a migraine i used to just go to my room, pull the shades, and lay there with the blanket over my head until it went away 
 Hjax: couldnt stand any light or sound 
 LelouchVC2: My migraines have either become less intense or i've gotten use to them over the years
 Astrobytes: Clusters will have you screaming on your knees begging for mercy for sometimes hours
 LelouchVC2: But I recall thinking about suicide the first 3 times it happened
 Hjax: yeah ive heard cluster headaches are supposed to be the worst pain you can experience 
 Astrobytes: Some pain. I hope they've actually become less intense LelouchVC2
 LelouchVC2: Pain was unbearable. I'd take pain killers and hope I could sleep before it hit when I got the aurora.
 Hjax: i never saw the auroras, my sister did though 
 LelouchVC2: i dont know how that compares to cluster headaches, but i can't imagine feeling pain worse than that
 LelouchVC2: the auroras are like taunts honestly
 LelouchVC2: "You're gonna get fucked in about 20 minutes, good luck!"
 Astrobytes: Donno what's better or not, when my other friend used to get them when we were younger it just used to come on with no warning
 LelouchVC2: Well, the aurara was good in that I could leave school to go home and get ready
 LelouchVC2: But it's almost traumatiic, just remembering what it looks like makes me wanna throw up
 Astrobytes: That's something I guess. I remember we were on a school trip at some adventure camp thing and my friend got one halfway down a cliff during abseiling... was kinda traumatic for him
 Astrobytes: Even though he had this preventative medication it didn't always work
 LelouchVC2: lmao
 LelouchVC2: I had medication, didn't do much
 LelouchVC2: I stopped taking it because it would make it 90% likely the next day i'd get another migrain
 Astrobytes: Not helpful
 LelouchVC2: yea, but the fear of the pain made me take it
 LelouchVC2: Never went back to refill it
 Astrobytes: Understandable
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 :P<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/473144951">https://www.codingame.com/replay/473144951</a>
 TrueBoxGuy: That was weird since the first 3 results were also subtraction, which was the pattern I initially identified 
 TrueBoxGuy: I had to rewrite my code, and writing the code for subtraction took far longer 
 LelouchVC2: Damn, that game was life ending
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes, I`m continuing the minimax for othello,  but Im stuck here...
 WINWINWIN: if depth == DEPTH:
 WINWINWIN: If I have this line, why is my move always None?
 Astrobytes: ...
 WINWINWIN: In my minimax function, I am not familiar with transposition tables
 WINWINWIN: so I just added that line of code so that I could find out the best node
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: the shortest game I have seen is 15 moves
 Astrobytes: Forget TTs for now. Are you evaluating anything?
 Astrobytes: 15 darkhorse64! amazing
 WINWINWIN: Yes, the evaluation function is just my coins - his coins
 Astrobytes: You might not be reaching the depth?
 WINWINWIN: Maybe, but wouldnt I time out then?
 darkhorse64: It was during a test in the IDE. Did not kept it. You made me pass a incredible number of times in that game
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, it was pretty much over just before you had to start passing I think
 Astrobytes: You were forced into making some unhealthy moves
 darkhorse64: My eval switched from 0.5 to nearly 0 in one move
 darkhorse64: I am still wondering if I do not have a bug. skip nodes are tricky to deal with
 darkhorse64: afk
 WINWINWIN: Fixed it by changing the return...
 WINWINWIN: Can anyone explain how global works within methods for python?
 Astrobytes: It's to enable you to modify a global from within the method afaik (I'm not exactly a python expert)
 Astrobytes: Google probably has a better explanation than that&#160;;)
 jacek: so you can have variable from the outside world in your method
 Uljahn: so you can make your code intertwined and impossible to debug :slight_smile:
 WINWINWIN: :D
 WINWINWIN: I tried using global... Did not work
 WINWINWIN: just changed the return type to fix it
 AntiSquid: see global keyword WINWINWIN
 AntiSquid: without global before var_name inside function you won't affect the variable in the global scope
 moidda: When will the Fall Challenge start?
 Astrobytes: Fall.
 moidda: I was hoping to get an apporximate date, but nevermind
 Astrobytes: Sorry, from the contest page "The date of the challenge is not decided yet. It should happen near the end of the year 2020. We'll keep you updated."
 Reksio: can i assume that all cpus used are 64bit for puzzles?
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Astrobytes: "Your program is compiled and run in a Linux environment on a 64bit multi-core architecture"
 AntiSquid: also there's a chance the challenge gets delayed, you never know moidda
 struct: Hello
 Astrobytes: hi struct
 struct: What algo are you using Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Othello? alphabeta, iterative deepening (not much point in the ID since not doing anything else with it currently)
 Astrobytes: Wanted to try this before trying any MCTS-based approach
 struct: Not sure how well mcts will do
 Astrobytes: darkhorse is doing better now, think he's added eval to it
 Astrobytes: Not sure if j acek has switched from his a/b yet but he's strong either way
 Astrobytes: darkhorse was using a vanilla mcts until this evening
 struct: When I have time I'll come a bot
 struct: just to add a league
 struct: code*
 Astrobytes: Oh cool, a league. Maybe that will help the coffee cup
 struct: Not sure when I will though
 struct: currently I want to check modules
 struct: I forgot how they work
 Astrobytes: Take your time man, game's cool
 LyteStarr: Hello, Is there someone who is familiar with ASP core / Blazor and databases here?
 struct: and not a lot of documentation on it
 Astrobytes: Working on project X?
 struct: Might be usefull
 Astrobytes: LyteStarr not me, sorry
 LyteStarr: All good, been learning a lot on my own but don't have connection to the industry. I hope i'm not messing something up :3
 Astrobytes: Plenty stuff on google (I'm sure you know&#160;;) ) Maybe someone else can point you in the right direction
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I have an appointment with Saul Goodman. G'night all
 LyteStarr: Later /
 darkhorse64: still mcts without eval. I got now 80k rollouts second turn but there are still a few rough edges with skip moves. I still hope to improve speed.

 tuanpenspinner: hi
 MrZee: Ok, now I've officially done my first hard level puzzle! Thought I did yesterday, but it was actually medium lol
 ninjadip: tight
 ninjadip: i'm here trying to get this farmer and his pet wolf and goat on the same side of the river
 Xascoria: why would a farmer have a pet wolf
 MrZee: You don't have a pet wolf?
 Xascoria: i have but im not a farmer
 Rafal12333: .
 Aimal: how do i use boost in mad pod?
 Thorcode: just print("Boost") if you want
 Aimal: i did that, but it doesn't seem like it's working
 5DN1L: replace the thrust with BOOST
 Aimal: here this is my code:
 Aimal: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef690e0a-0b8d-4158-a4fe-1c6896adec1f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef690e0a-0b8d-4158-a4fe-1c6896adec1f</a>
 Aimal: ignore the empty space between checkpoint y and boost
 Thorcode: n√¥
 Thorcode: no
 5DN1L: Did you forget "else"? Aimal
 Thorcode: del the nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointY + " " +  at the print boost sentence
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Aimal: does having else matters here?
 Thorcode: i think no
 Aimal: so do you know how do I fix it?
 Uljahn: without else you will print twice
 Aimal: i just added the else
 Aimal: but it still doesnt boost
 Uljahn: you have one boost only
 Uljahn: every next boost is equal to max thrust
 Aimal: what?
 Aimal: so how do I fix that
 Thorcode: fix what?
 Aimal: he said "every boost is equal to max thrust" so how do i not make it equal to max thrust
 Uljahn: use it once per race
 Aimal: but like how?
 Aimal: should I delete the if statement
 Thorcode: dunno 
 5DN1L: We need to see your whole code
 Thorcode: it depend in this nextCheckPointDist &lt; 500 i think
 Uljahn: guess you could use a boolean variable to track the state of your boost, add a condition to use boost when it's available, and make it unavailable after the use
 Aimal: this is the whole code
 Aimal: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a76de271-4eab-485d-aaf6-3291cc9f4b5a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a76de271-4eab-485d-aaf6-3291cc9f4b5a</a>
 5DN1L: You need to add a space before BOOST
 derjack: like System.out.println( nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointY + "spaceBOOST" );
 5DN1L: üíØ
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 spaceBOOST now
 Automaton2000: i thought you meant that

 Passifi: Hey y'all anyone who could tell my code here just never exists the last while loop&#160;? I coded a test version of it in visual studio code and there it works fine... and I am really at a loss here
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05e9a28f-be3d-4c54-8ea4-e454e0f915a5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05e9a28f-be3d-4c54-8ea4-e454e0f915a5</a>
 Passifi: it is in c++&#160;:)
 Passifi: the error stream does give me a 0 value when the pointer is set to NULL and then the while loop doesn't seem to repeat anymore, but the execution just stops seemingly, can't make heads or tails of it.
 therealbeef: in the if statements you are dereferencing the target pointer
 Passifi: ohhh
 therealbeef: if it's 0, those lines cause crash
 Passifi: yeah I get it ... silly thanks
 therealbeef: you're welcome
 ninjadip: if using c++ and pointers you should use the nullptr for null and not NULL
 ninjadip: nullptr is a keyword that represents zero as an address (its type is considered a pointer-type), while NULL is the value zero as an int 
 Marcos_Rocha: :grin:
 Uljahn: featured puzzle event again :pensive:
 ninjadip: yay
 ninjadip: what is it 
 Uljahn: similar to puzzle of the week with voting for the best solution

 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/events">https://www.codingame.com/events</a>
 Uljahn: i don't understand you, sry :slight_smile:
 ninjadip: oh it's unknown
 ninjadip: what the puzzle is Uljahn, i was wondering. i've only done one, i forgot they don't tell you until it starts
 Uljahn: ah, i see
 Uljahn: they don't tell PotW either
 frranciscoglo: hola
 ninjadip: pot?
 derjack: is multiplayer game a puzzle?
 Uljahn: indeed, some multis happend to be PotW
 ninjadip: whats pot2

 Uljahn: you can find past potws in your notifications (click "show read")
 ninjadip: k
 derjack: is mayonnaise an instrument
 TKirishima: Hello World
 Uljahn: guess you can hammer a nail with frozen mayo
 Aquajag: i swear i'm looking at classic puzzles and i can't even understand what they're asking me to do....
 5DN1L: which ones
 Aquajag: anything medium. like "there is no spoon." find a node and neighbor. what?? input is number and somehow I'm supposed to know what a node is?
 5DN1L: there is an example
 5DN1L: in the statement itself
 Aquajag: i'll admit i didn't scroll that far before my brain gave out
 5DN1L: always do so then!
 Uljahn: might be better to start on easy puzzles though, there are some with hints
 KalamariKing: even the easy puzzles can be difficult to beginners, keep that in mind
 MysteriousGirl: anyone a C++ pro here?

 eulerscheZahl: some are already removed because of poor rating
 eulerscheZahl: and one of them breaks my formatting at the bottom
 slogslog: to be honest. Such a Clash of Code week is nice if the clashes are diffictult enough but I like this site much more for the puzzles.
 slogslog: But it's good for novice coders.
 Angs: I only saw one Haskell CoC: who's the fastest to write a*x+b
 Angs: Wasn't really worth the wait
 Angs: Better clash curation would have been nice
 MohamedMiri: hello , does the Coc rating in the end of Coc do something&#160;?
 Uljahn: it affects your rank
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: it would take 15 EMPs to take out the whole U.S.
 5DN1L: it would take 1 more spam for you to be kicked out
 MohamedMiri: no , when we rate the CoC
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: fine, is it probably to make a coded EMP?

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i try to do the best on my homework
 5DN1L: good for you. what homework do you have? coding assignments?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i mean in school, and im trying to get into coding classes

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i did some "stuff"

 Wontonimo: go do programming eve, then come back
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: but im doing homework
 Wontonimo: I've given you a few min time out.  Please come back *after* you've programmed and hhave something programming related to talk about

 Marn: In C++ are structs just public classes are are there more differences&#160;?
 struct: they are just public by default
 Wontonimo: not that i'm aware of
 Wontonimo: what struct said
 Ceekay77: yup, struct is correct
 Andriamanitra: aren't structs also passed by value?
 Andriamanitra: quick googling says yes, and also structs are allocated on the stack rather than on the heap like classes
 struct: Classes are not stored on the heap
 struct: are we talking about c++?
 Andriamanitra: yes, i guess geeksforgeeks is wrong then (which does not surprise me much)
 struct: you can store it in the heap or stack
 Ceekay77: both can be stack or heap, depending on how you allocate
 Ceekay77: Personally, I rarely use a struct without allocating it dynamically from the heap
 ninjadip: structs and classes differ from their ability to encapsulate/polymorph and all that cool class stuff right?
 ninjadip: i usually use structs for small things that can stand alone and that have no methods. just like a structure of variables, no methods on how to act, i know they can, but that's what i do
 SandmanSW96: what language ninjadip&#160;?
 bmacho: well I hate both structs and classes equally 
 bmacho: esp in c++ and in other languages 
 ZackEdwards: woohoo!
 bmacho: the very top Java solution represents points in a grid as numbers, and calls x[i] and y[i] for their coordinates instead of p.x and p.y

 JohnCM: can c++ declare tuples like this:tuple &lt;int, int&gt; a = {1, 2};
 JohnCM: or must you always do make_tuple(1,2)
 ngiokweng: hi
 ArtLiteracyStory: hi
 Mgs25: @JohnCM you can just curly init
 Mgs25: it will work
 ArtLiteracyStory: I'm addicted to this site
 ArtLiteracyStory: so fun
 JohnCM: ok thanks
 JohnCM: actually for stl containers, most can do curly init right?
 Mgs25: yup! C++17 is very flexible in this aspect of curly bracket initialization
 JohnCM: i'm trying to like code c++ in the most pythonic way ever
 Mgs25: good luck lol
 MysticZarah: helloello
 JohnCM: haha python has spoilt me, now whenever i need to do list comprehension, i have to code 3 lines in c++
 JohnCM: and i have to convert to binary myself in c++
 JohnCM: oh wait, i just realized there is itoa
 Alihussain: hi bro iam new here
 onesimpletoo:  path3 = 
 MysticZarah: O!
 MysticZarah: I thing i just realized the issue with the code validation i have been having. somehow.
 MysticZarah: wait then that doesnt explain why the other validation got fixed

 spjass: How do I zoom in / out in the web IDE? I accidentally somehow zoomed out on my code and zooming on the webpage (with ctrl+) doesn't help as it zooms in too close with other content on the page.
 magmasa: when you click inside ide ctrl+mouse scroll works
 The_xD: ctrl  +
 derjack: good morning

 nam4.nguyen: hi does CG provide certificate or something after contest?
 nam4.nguyen: just curious
 derjack: participation badge?
 nam4.nguyen: Oh where can I find it?
 AntiSquid: you could go to contests and print what's in the view report link
 AntiSquid: but no badge or anything like that
 AntiSquid: you can't even display full code in your view report :thinking:
 AntiSquid: wonder who it's intended for
 nam4.nguyen: ah I just wanna know more about CG

 KalamariKing: Hello
 KalamariKing: Wait you mean to tell me there are almost 3 million clash-of-coders
 jacek: 3 millions too many
 BorisBarca: hey guys, I was wandering can you do a 1v1 on spring challenge but we are both out of top 1000
 BorisBarca: *wondering
 KalamariKing: jacâ€‹ek I had thought so since there aren't 3mil people here, but I just ran into someone in 2.7 millionth place...?
 jrke: KalamariKing there are 2.3 million coders on CG then how you could ran 2.7 million
 KalamariKing: i seriously don't know
 jrke: and only 250,097 clashers are there
 KalamariKing: I know
 KalamariKing: I've seen the numbers
 KalamariKing: That's why I questioned
 TBali: Once I was 2nd in a one-horse-race
 jrke: you are 230 i can see in clash ranking
 KalamariKing: Yep
 Bitwolf.Jr: join noobs
 zibizz1: Can I somway disable shortext code? My language can't beat phyton in that
 AntiSquid: don't be rude Bitwolf.Jr
 jacek: zibizz1 no
 KalamariKing: Python is sometimes unfair in shortest
 KalamariKing: Usually the winner is python and/or ruby, except for your occasional bash
 jacek: use the right tool for rith problem
 KalamariKing: Exactly
 KalamariKing: Take the time to learn python or ruby
 Uljahn: or play bot programming instead (the right job for the right tool)
 derjack: got back that place in oware. phew
 KalamariKing: The placement shown on profile hover, that's sitewide, right?
 KalamariKing: As in not challenge-specific
 derjack: its global ranking, yes
 jrke: oh jacek first in oware
 jrke: gratz
 derjack: :innocent:
 AntiSquid: stop playing clash :P
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll .
 AntiSquid: was replying to an older message

 post4k: Is there a place here on codingame where I can practice their interview-style process? multiple questions of certain languages, and various coding challenges.
 post4k: im asking since my next interview will be on this platform
 post4k:&#160;:)
 derjack: you may try asking that on discord
 Uljahn: maybe this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>
 struct: I would solve some puzzles to understand how the platform works
 post4k: yea, exactly, I think the free trial is what I want, thanks&#160;!
 post4k: yea, done that already&#160;:)
 struct: I think its a similar style
 struct: Maybe you also have to answer some questions
 struct: idk, never done it
 post4k: well not exactly, the interviews have multiple choice questions and stuff as well
 post4k: so, its like, 20 something questions, and 5 or something coding challenges (usually 15 minutes each)
 post4k: ive done one before
 [CG]Thibaud: post4k a free trial won't help
 [CG]Thibaud: best way to practice is to do puzzles on CodinGame
 [CG]Thibaud: before taking your test, you'll be able to pass a tutorial to check how the test platform works (really close to CodinGame)
 post4k: @[CG]Thibaud yea, now I noticed that the free trial is just a login to codingame. I did one of those tutorials before, and what I wondered was if I could try some more of those before my interview. Seems not. Anyways, thanks.

 eulerscheZahl: JohnCM 02:59PMwhat's the difference between codingame for work and the normal codingame
 eulerscheZahl: CG for work is a recruiting platform
 eulerscheZahl: you apply at company X which is a partner of CG. X gives you a link where you do some tests (multiple choice, coding tasks)
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr the cotnest is over
 eulerscheZahl: contest*
 jacek: :thinking:
 dbdr: contest is dead, long live the multi
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, congrats on being the first to ever reach 200k CP&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: yeah gz toad!
 ZarthaxX: he got 200k with royale too tho :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: 1st by a devastating landslide victory
 JohnCM: i see, so the coding tasks and multiple choice is decided by the recruiting platform right
 eulerscheZahl: 22 points

 eulerscheZahl: reading the post mortems there was one player in top20 doing it
 Twelve0: because I don't remember anyone talking about using it
 dbdr: that tag is a mistake I would say

 eulerscheZahl: right, the tag. I was wondering what it's doing there
 Twelve0: so was it beam search and MCTS&#160;?

 Twelve0: I was finished 167 in legend without any sim or search , ( i guess a lot of people used hust huestics too )

 eulerscheZahl: the rather stupid grow-it-all was the best I could do

 Twelve0: what's PM??

 jacek: post mortem
 eulerscheZahl: "I was finished 167 in legend without any sim or search"it's really out of line for CodinGame to have such a huge legend league as it happened this time

 BlaiseEbuth: To gulag&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: struct :rofl:
 Westicles: Do the NN approaches use up all the 100ms turn time?
 MSmits: Westicles sure why not
 MSmits: if they search
 MSmits: they still build a tree
 MSmits: do rollouts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I didn't think there was enought ime to run the millions of sims to make an NN, reCurse proved me wrong
 MSmits: so more time = more rollouts
 Westicles: Ah okay, I wondered if beam would catch up with longer times
 MSmits: beam?
 BlaiseEbuth: More rollouts = more autobots
 Westicles: beam search
 MSmits: you mean with greater width
 MSmits: beam has a huge limitation, it would do better with less time actually
 eulerscheZahl: NN is about finding a good scoring in a chaotic game
 MSmits: because with more time you dont solve the problem that you ignore opponent
 MSmits: so at some point your bot just cant get better with more time
 Marchete: beam is shortsighted
 Twelve0: guys what do you think about the difficulty comparing spring with last fall&#160;?
 Marchete: and ignores enemy a lot
 MSmits: same as GA
 struct: ofc there is enough time to play 1 mill games
 MSmits: mcts/duct/minimax approaches get better with time
 struct: I ran around 330k games in 3 hours
 MSmits: and they can be combined with NN
 Westicles: I see.  So really the only way to get rid of NN is reduce max file size
 Marchete: hands down
 struct: on the ec2 machine
 BlaiseEbuth: Was more difficult for the servers Twelve0
 Marchete: MCTS is good by the statistical tree it makes
 MSmits: Westicles not really. You can make a NN with only 2kb, it would not eval as well, but it would also be faster
 Marchete: pure vanilla MCTS isn't good usually
 eulerscheZahl: how do you define difficulty Twelve0?
 MSmits: imagine, you can make a good minimax with only 6 or 8 parameters in most boardgames
 struct: Game was very simple to sim
 MSmits: how many params can you fit in 2 kb?
 struct: easier than previous challenge
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's "how difficult is it top reach top X on the leaderboard". which is always pretty much the same
 Marchete: imo you can use NN also in minimax
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: you can
 MSmits: thats my point
 Marchete: minimax policy  + value
 Marchete: policy for move ordering
 Marchete: and value as score
 MSmits: NN will always be better than regular minimax, even with tiny file size
 Marchete: stockfish NNUE is like that?
 Marchete: I haven't reviewed
 Twelve0: eulerscheZahl I don't know, like the complexity of the game rules
 Marchete: but the damn a0 has so many little things
 eulerscheZahl: that was low in both the recent and previous contest
 Marchete: noise here and there
 MSmits: you can apply them gradually Marchete
 Marchete: little things
 struct: stockfish NN was updated
 MSmits: like you can start with a value NN and later add policy
 struct: btw
 eulerscheZahl: pacman was a little more complex but still feasible
 Marchete: no
 Wontonimo: man, the chat is abuzz with nn
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md">https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md</a>
 Marchete: I prefer policy  + value
 MSmits: yes i know Marchete, but i mean when learning things
 Marchete: I thought about the policy1+policy2+value
 Wontonimo: it's as if it's done well recently or something
 Marchete: as recurs_e said
 MSmits: no need to do everything at once
 Marchete: but I don't know
 struct: new network architecture
 struct: scroll to the end
 struct: Architectures and new directions
 MSmits: Marchete would oware have 7 outputs with value + policy?
 MSmits: 1 value output + 6 policy outputs?
 Wontonimo: if the action space is small enough, and you don't want to do everything at once, then start with a value network only
 jacek: Marchete NNUE is only value
 Wontonimo: if you are combining with search
 Wontonimo: if  you don't  have search, then do policy first
 MSmits: the nice thing about policy is that it guides exploration so you dont do obviously bad moves on low visit nodes
 Wontonimo: ^^ exactly&#160;!
 MSmits: it's like doing mcts with a minimax eval to guide  exploration
 MSmits: this is a thing
 MSmits: it's not really NN only
 Wontonimo: i was just commenting on your comment MSmits that you don't have to do everything at once
 MSmits: oh right
 jacek: MSmits yeah, oware has 7 outputs, value and 6 moves
 MSmits: yeah you dont
 Marchete: ask jacek and robo MSmits :D
 MSmits: cool jacek, got it then
 Marchete: I'd say yes
 MSmits: jacek doesnt use policy, but he knows yeah
 Marchete: I know
 struct: Are you gonna try NN MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah,  i am
 MSmits: will be experimenting with oware
 struct: oh nice
 jacek: i somewhat sped up my NN and took back my place in oware
 JohnCM: but is pytorch included in codingame?
 MSmits: good job
 struct: One day I expect to do the same, but Im still a begginer on this NN stuff
 MSmits: though it's really hard to say with those 4 NN's, there's soooo much RPS going on
 struct: no JohnCM
 Marchete: My NN jacekmax wasn't that good
 MSmits: dont know which is better
 Marchete: heuristic was better
 Wontonimo: so, my $0.02 is: if you just want to get your feet wet, do value+search OR policy w/o search for games with a small action space.
 JohnCM: i use neural networks a lot for my research, but it's all in python
 MSmits: Wontonimo oware is one of those games
 Marchete: fenri_r did CSB without any search 
 Marchete: just pure action critic
 MSmits: the game is even solvable if you add some ruls to avoid loops
 MSmits: rules
 JohnCM: actually for games like backgammon, only one linear layer of NN is sufficient
 MSmits: I doubt it's much more complex than our connect 4 version
 jacek: oh cool discussion going on and i have to leave, meh
 JohnCM: like it's more important to do the TD-learning
 Wontonimo: JohnCM - you can export your trained weights and import them into CG and execute them with matrix math.  no backprop needed during the game execution
 MSmits: jacek i am sure it will be redone&#160;:)
 jacek: yeah, dont forget good training pipeline
 JohnCM: ya i'm thinking that i would need to code it out myself to use it in CG
 Marchete: as if it was that easy
 JohnCM: like code out the NN code
 Marchete: function loss for example
 Marchete: isn't that trivial
 MSmits: what do you mean Marchete
 Marchete: how do you tell your NN how is your loss
 Marchete: policy+value
 Marchete: you train, but what is the target?
 MSmits: oh, well i have a place to start with jacek's method
 MSmits: he does a mcts with 200x rollout and eval of all children (using randomized NN)
 MSmits: then his target is the average value, not sure for policy
 MSmits: maybe the target is best action
 MSmits: basically, you take all visited gamestates
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628">https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628</a>
 jacek: policy is set of visits likes {0, 1/5, 2/5, 1/5, 1/5}
 MSmits: eval with NN and compare with eval over 200 rollouts
 Marchete: you need to get a loss value for that
 MSmits: oh yeah, nice way
 MSmits: yes Marchete. Loss is the difference
 Marchete: policy:{0, 1/5, 2/5, 1/5, 1/5}, value 0.33
 Marchete: what is loss?
 MSmits: the difference between the output of the NN and the result of the search
 jacek: look for softmax loss, -target * log(p)
 MSmits: I had a chat with an expert that i  saved Marchete
 Marchete: I'm looking at a0 loss functions
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e67c0c8-6484-4e05-9061-cce6e4e8a7f9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e67c0c8-6484-4e05-9061-cce6e4e8a7f9</a>
 Marchete: I don't see the loss
 Marchete: I'm looking in a0 or actor critic
 Marchete: that seems similar
 Marchete: you need to minimize two kind of losses at the same time
 Marchete: a softmax + tanh (for example)
 MSmits: how do you not see the loss?
 MSmits: you have a search value
 MSmits: thats the target
 MSmits: you have a gamestate you can input into the nn
 MSmits: thats the value you use to calculate loss
 MSmits: loss = search result - gamestate value from NN lookup
 MSmits: this is the value loss 
 Marchete: you need to define that function
 MSmits: search result is just the value calculated with mcts
 MSmits: it's wins/visits
 Marchete: k*sum(policyloss)+l*sum(valueloss)
 Marchete: what is more important?
 MSmits: can't you backpropagate them separately?
 MSmits: they are separate output
 Marchete: afaik you have only 1 loss value
 MSmits: well you're talking about using policy and i am just guessing here. I still have to do this with just value to get started
 Marchete: it's not that I don't know that policy and value are compared to the NN output given some gamestate
 Marchete: but the innards of what to give as "loss"
 MSmits: but do you understand what i mean when it is just value?
 Marchete: no
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: lets forget policy then
 MSmits: you have a NN
 MSmits: roll it out 200 times
 MSmits: evaling all children and backpropagating the results, like you would in a normal search
 MSmits: your gamestate will get a value from this
 MSmits: it's a bad nn, random parameters and all that
 MSmits: doesnt matter
 MSmits: you still get a value
 MSmits: this value will on average be better than a value from 1 rollout right?
 MSmits: at least near the end of the game when its near solved
 MSmits: this value is better, so you use it as a target
 MSmits: you keep running games, with, say 200 rollouts
 MSmits: each time you use the average value as a training target for your nn
 MSmits: for every gamestate you encountered during the game
 MSmits: (for oware, like 100 states per game)
 MSmits: so 1 game gives you 100 training states with an average value as target
 MSmits: basically you train the NN to give as result the same result as its previous version did after 200 rollouts
 Marchete: it depends on what you assume as value
 MSmits: so 200 rollouts become 1 (ideally)
 Marchete: i.e. you perfectly can do:
 MSmits: the value is just what the NN outputs, some number between 0 and 1
 MSmits: doesnt matter what it means, higher is better
 MSmits: and over 200 rollouts it's an average, still between 0 and 1
 Marchete: save a bufferReplay with moves
 Marchete: end rollout
 Marchete: backpropagate win loss as value
 Marchete: policy is&#160;% visits per root child
 Marchete: of the MCTS
 MSmits: ye i dont know about policy really
 Marchete: simplistic policy (and Robo said that too)
 MSmits: I just know what i just explained is what makes jacek best at oware...
 Marchete: is using number of visits
 Marchete: to make a&#160;%
 Marchete: I know what he does
 MSmits: right
 Marchete: but also it's kind of valid
 MSmits: well the&#160;% thing makes sense, but i didnt think about it much
 Marchete: go to endgame
 Marchete: take the 0/1
 Marchete: and apply it to the whole moveset
 Marchete: 1 for winner player
 Marchete: 0 for the other
 Marchete: in my initial idea
 MSmits: but thats a bit dangerous maybe? You'd evaluate all 100 gamestates as 1 if you won
 Marchete: I'd review what papers and a0 said
 MSmits: is this what ao does?
 Marchete: I think
 MSmits: just all states of a win are 1?
 reCurse: If you want my two cents
 Marchete: we want!
 MSmits: of course reCurse
 reCurse: Set your expectations to the minimum
 reCurse: Get something really stupid to work
 reCurse: I'd say a0 is not the best to get started
 reCurse: Q learning though, probably
 MSmits: that was my plan, jacek's plan is not stupid, but quite simple, i know how to do it
 reCurse: Getting a CSB runner through Q learning is not too difficult and rewarding
 reCurse: I started there, would recommend
 Marchete: actor critic is harder?
 KalamariKing: Who thinks I can get top 200
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: whats actor critic again?
 reCurse: Training a policy
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: thats the thing though, jacek doesnt use policy for oware
 reCurse: Well "technically" you also train a policy with Q learning
 reCurse: But let's ignore those details
 Marchete: jacek "infers" a policy MSmits
 MSmits: but only uses value in his bot
 Marchete: if you apply the value to children
 Marchete: == policy
 Marchete: you need to "open" all children
 Marchete: evaluate
 Marchete: to recover what it could be the policy
 MSmits: well thats not exactly the same
 MSmits: in use at least
 MSmits: but if you mean the bot tends to choose good moves and policy helps with that too, then yes
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: I mean jacekmax does it
 MSmits: oh right, he keeps the max
 MSmits: but he doesnt just use jacekmax
 Marchete: expansion: expand the node leaf by every possible children (every possible moves), add eval to every children
 MSmits: he also uses EPT
 MSmits: with NN
 Marchete: not about the "max" part
 Marchete: but this
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but that's just the first visit
 MSmits: doesnt count for much in exploration
 Marchete: ...as alphazero does with policy
 MSmits: sure but policy gives a bit more difference in visits
 MSmits: low policy moves get visited much later dont they?
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: if you eval all children, you maybe visit a good child 3 times before you visit the bad child again
 MSmits: i think policy generally makes more of a difference
 Wontonimo: totally off topic&#160;: anyone know if there is a referee available for Code Royale&#160;?  I don't see it in the list of brutaltester refs
 MSmits: but hey, this discussion is why jacek always says he doesnt see the need for policy
 MSmits: because what you say does make sense Marchete
 MSmits: but generally policy seems to work better
 Marchete: I mean they are similar, not exact
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: im back
 MSmits: which is why just doing value is a much easier place to start&#160;:)
 jacek: and i dont use policy
 jacek: the 'policy' youre referring to is 1-ply value search, if im correct
 Marchete: yes
 jacek: theyre not the same, are they
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: they are "similar"
 Marchete: or at least I see it that way
 struct: Wontonimo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/csj/code-royale">https://github.com/csj/code-royale</a>
 Wontonimo: imo policy is great for something with a huge branching, like GO.   It's also good for an informed rollout for some of the depth.
 Marchete: anyways I have no idea
 MSmits: the effects are similar in that you will visit high policy children more often and you will also visit high value children more often
 Marchete: I deviated you
 MSmits: but you waste way more visits if you just use value
 MSmits: as Wontonimo suggests
 MSmits: oware though, has small branching
 Wontonimo: but i haven't actually coded something like alphaZero yet, so all my thoughts are just that, thoughts
 Marchete: value alone is easier to calculate loss
 MSmits: yeah
 Wontonimo: thanks for the link MSmits
 RoboStac: but aren't you using tensorflow for training?
 Marchete: me?
 RoboStac: yeah
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: I think if you want to get into NN, motivation is a big deal. If you can get something to work that helps you move on to othe rthings
 Marchete: but how do combine policy + loss properly?
 Marchete: I always thought TF asks for a single loss value
 Marchete: not two
 reCurse: MSmits words of wisdom
 jacek: doesnt tensorflow calculate policy loss for you?
 RoboStac: look into cross entropy loss
 MSmits: yeah, well you said so in your pm also
 MSmits: reCurse
 Marchete: cross entropy loss
 Marchete: ok
 reCurse: Tensorflow calculates gradients for you
 Marchete: I've read somewhere they give less weight to value part
 jacek: whats the difference between cross entropy loss and softmax
 reCurse: I would say though learning how the gradients are computed and backpropagated was immensely helpful for me
 reCurse: But it's not necessary I guess?
 jacek: in the world of import nn; nn.train();? no
 Marchete: it seems that is cross-entropy what I was talking about, thanks Robo
 reCurse: I've been able to understand problems and apply solutions that I wouldnt have been able to otherwise
 Wontonimo: hey Marchete, you can do two loss functions at the same time in TF, let me get you a link...
 reCurse: Two loss is just combined into one loss :P
 jacek: the more you know, i was using 'cross-entropy loss', not 'softmax loss' in my latest policy experiments... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.quora.com/Is-the-softmax-loss-the-same-as-the-cross-entropy-loss">https://www.quora.com/Is-the-softmax-loss-the-same-as-the-cross-entropy-loss</a>
 reCurse: You always start from a single loss
 Marchete: so softmaxloss*k+valueloss*(1-k)
 Marchete: or all together softmax+value?
 reCurse: I'd say lerping is not too helpful
 JFB: I wonder - maybe yuse diferent lost function in different epoch? 
 Wontonimo: Here Marchete <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-aUaeIrGw7rDm1hSEBwVRo0RaKbf-IWb">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-aUaeIrGw7rDm1hSEBwVRo0RaKbf-IWb</a> is a colab notebook showing that you can train 2 losses at once for different heads
 reCurse: policy * X + value * Y
 reCurse: Is the preferred way to look at it IMO
 Marchete: ok
 Wontonimo: the losses in that colab notebook are not combined, but effect different netowrks
 Wontonimo: to maximize learning, the shared part of the two networks learn at the same time
 reCurse: Also can be more difficult to get right
 Wontonimo: ^^ +1
 reCurse: I can't stress enough how important it is to start small
 JFB: I do not seen the beginig of the discussion so stupid question: why do you  plan to use tensorflow and not pytorch? I understund that now most people use pytoch. (I have no experience with pytorch only with tensorflow so jus ask for curiosity)
 reCurse: Having those first successes is essential for motivation
 reCurse: I much prefer pytorch myself
 reCurse: Just pick whatever suits your fancies
 kovi: just opened the chat or policy1 * x1  + policy2 * x2 + value * y in case of duct?
 reCurse: You won't go wrong with tf either
 MSmits: reCurse what do you like about pytorch compared to tensorflow with or without keras
 reCurse: It used to be about what's now called 'eager mode' in tf
 reCurse: The declarative approach kind of sucks to understand what's going on
 MSmits: I see
 reCurse: With pytorch you type one line and get immediate results
 reCurse: So it's more natural to follow
 reCurse: And with all the advances of previous years it's not that bad for performance anymore
 MSmits: ah ok. Do you personally use these frameworks? Or do you still use something completely your own?
 reCurse: What I would call version "1.0" of my RL pipeline was all hand-made from scratch A to Z
 reCurse: Now I use pytorch and the like
 MSmits: yeah i remember that
 kovi: :o
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: Like I said, understanding how it works at the lower level was immensely helpful, can't understate that
 reCurse: It's like programming without understanding memory and stuff
 MSmits: yeah I am not sure how it would be for me. I have a pretty good grasp on the matrix stuff and derivatives
 dbdr: *can't overstate it?&#160;;)
 jacek: thats why i made xor example from scratch without numpty
 reCurse: Oops.
 jacek: numpy even
 reCurse: Thanks dbdr
 reCurse: I can't lit
 dbdr: :D
 Astrobytes: numpty lol
 MSmits: i did that too jacek as per your advice
 dbdr: it's ok reCurse, you can other stuff&#160;;)
 reCurse: Sometimes
 MSmits: numpty dumpty sat on a wall
 reCurse: xor is a bit boring
 reCurse: Start with mnist
 reCurse: It's very easy and more concrete
 JFB: What is "xor"&#160;?
 kovi: but its so much easier with keras
 MSmits: ^
 MSmits: (answering JFB)
 reCurse: Programming in python is easier
 MSmits: exclusive or
 reCurse: Closes you some doors though
 MSmits: input 1 1 -&gt; output 0
 jacek: mnist? in c++ from scratch?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: input 1 0 -&gt; output 1
 reCurse: That's actually how I started
 jacek: :scream:
 ThePoisoned1: imo
 kovi: i hate that tf is not c++ native
 reCurse: It's not a big deal imo
 JFB: But why use numpy for xor? I expect that jacek have something different in mind that '^'
 ThePoisoned1: python is just easier that other popular languages and that can make u harder to learn the others
 ThePoisoned1: if u learnt python first
 ThePoisoned1: the other way around is way easier
 MSmits: it's also a bit difficult to learn python if you learn other languages first, goes both ways&#160;:)
 ThePoisoned1: make it*
 Wontonimo: tensorflow now has eager mode on by default (late response, but I love TF,  so I'm plugging it)
 ThePoisoned1: i started with java
 kovi: but im lazy...dont want to spend months to reimplement the wheel even if it gives me insights
 ThePoisoned1: but now python is jsut do whatever and kidna works
 ThePoisoned1: xdd
 MSmits: kovi, if you want to know the basics without doing what reCurse suggests, darkhorse shared a good book yesterday
 kovi: reinvent/reimplement the wheel
 MSmits: let me look it up
 kovi: im ok, i did ml in udacity selfdriving
 kovi: but only in workspaces
 jacek: and they didnt have the wheel?
 Marchete: writting a whole NN learning framework seems too overkill to me
 Marchete: if TF/pytorch do it...
 MSmits: neural network from scratch in python
 den_lakeev: guys, what does 'valid word' in scrabble means? it's made from player's letters - is it the only one condition in this game?
 MSmits: is the title, or almost
 kovi: some colleges did deep learning in detail...and as they told me it is "deep"...
 MSmits: i'm at page 50/650 :P
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 struct: is it worth it MSmits?
 MSmits: so far i saw nothing new for me struct, but it's quite good
 Nerchio: is it from the youtube guy? 
 MSmits: i think so Nerchio
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI</a>
 struct: yes Nerchio
 jacek: den_lakeev is this puzzle?
 JFB: Better that 50/1234650 page&#160;:-)
 MSmits: yeah thats him
 struct: maybe ill buy it
 Nerchio: i watched a few videos they were pretty good i might check out the book then
 kovi: ofc, there is a difference between understanding and implementing a whole fw properly
 struct: I was also checking the videos and found them begginer friendly
 struct: Does the book all start from the basic MSmits?
 MSmits: yes kovi, but if you're worried about going straight to TF out of laziness and missing the basics, then the book + videos might fill that gap
 struct: also start*
 MSmits: very basics yes
 MSmits: even matrix multiplication is explained
 MSmits: transposition and all that
 struct: ok ty
 reCurse: I'm probably bottom tier teacher, so take what I say with a grain of salt
 reCurse: I'm more of a first principles
 reCurse: I hate magic
 Astrobytes: That's how I learn, yeah
 MSmits: it's abstraction
 JFB: reCurse - I prefered your aproach when I have had better memory&#160;:-)
 MSmits: dont abstract before you understand what you are abstract
 MSmits: -ing
 reCurse: Exactly
 reCurse: Because things will definitely go wrong
 reCurse: And you'll need to understand why
 Nerchio: you can always ask in cg chat what went wrong :joy:
 Wontonimo: i haven't done NN on CG yet.   My plan is to leverage TF offline and pick an architecture that is easy to export and implement by hand.  
 MSmits: Wontonimo there's mokka also 
 JFB: mokka? 
 Nerchio: but because of this NN stuff i curiously checked out last Halite competition that was hosted on Kaggle
 Wontonimo: mokka?
 Nerchio: and like top7 were all heuristics bots or something
 Nerchio: even if the site is aimed towards machine learning
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a>
 reCurse: Halite is a weird story
 reCurse: I think they tried to promote machine learning with it
 MSmits: use TF to train NN, then mokka for inference
 reCurse: Realized most people couldn't beat regular approaches with it in that context
 reCurse: And gave up on it? I don't know
 TiopazHc: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/her-majestys-well-shared-secret">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/her-majestys-well-shared-secret</a>Has anyone solved it?&#160;: 'v
 Nerchio: yeah maybe not so many people interested in game AI too
 Nerchio: that are knowledgable in the this area
 reCurse: Yeah probably
 Wontonimo: nice, thanks MSmits
 reCurse: Turns out plugging stuff in tensorflow isn't enough sometimes :D
 MSmits: thank Marchete&#160;:)
 MSmits: i havent used it before, but i plan to, later
 MSmits: even if i cant get it to work i can steal functions from there
 MSmits: so will sure be useful
 ThePoisoned1: if i want to start learning about what i need to make bot for stuff like the challenges where and what should i start with/do (heruistics,machine learning,monte carlo tree search) 
 kovi: kaggle halite is python only isnt it?
 ThePoisoned1: or what do i need
 reCurse: Last I checked yes
 reCurse: Kaggle halite is also a shadow of its former self
 kovi: and no recurse bot to be imitated&#160;;)
 reCurse: A tiny one at that
 reCurse: Heh
 MSmits: ThePoisoned1 every contest is different, it's hard to say what you will need for the next one
 struct: Is cg the only one remaining?
 ThePoisoned1: i mean to start learning about how to them
 reCurse: struct: Some would say raic
 MSmits: do you know how to do pathfinding ThePoisoned1?
 ThePoisoned1: nope
 MSmits: allright, look up breadth first search
 MSmits: and apply it 
 struct: I dont enjoy raic tbh
 MSmits: to whatever 
 struct: But I understand some people like it
 MSmits: a puzzle, a tutorial
 MSmits: can be anything
 jacek: clash
 MSmits: watch videos on it... if you have google skills you can learn BFS
 Nerchio: last raic was my first and have to say it wasn't too bad
 Nerchio: kind of native support of multi file AIs
 kovi: it was good. somewhat similar to halite3
 Nerchio: game itself was pretty good too
 ThePoisoned1: videos on breadth first search?
 HoangH7: Hello everyone.
 MSmits: sure
 reCurse: multifile is just a copy/paste automation job away
 MSmits: youtube
 ThePoisoned1: or just on everything
 MSmits: BFS
 ThePoisoned1: okay
 MSmits: i am just telling you 1 thing that is sometimes needed for contest
 kovi: i had single file raic
 Nerchio: reCurse true but for beginners easier entry
 MSmits: and quite easy to learn, easier than most other things
 Nerchio: but yeah CG doesn't have too much competition
 MSmits: wait what
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-visualize-convolutional-features-in-40-lines-of-code-70b7d87b0030">https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-visualize-convolutional-features-in-40-lines-of-code-70b7d87b0030</a> could be interesting
 MSmits: you mean on NNs&#160;?
 MSmits: or in general?
 DomiKo: if you never seed any visualizations of NN's
 DomiKo: seen*
 reCurse: CG is the last place for serious bot competitions imho
 MSmits: yeah it's great
 reCurse: If it goes down that field is gone
 MSmits: we need to keep it alive 
 JFB: true
 reCurse: I stopped actively caring about it :P
 reCurse: Feel better for it
 MSmits: thats fine reCurse, as long as someone does. you contribute just by making great bots
 reCurse: Trying to change something out of your control is madness anyway
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: well it's not 100% out of your control, just 99,99%, if many players care, it will stay
 reCurse: OTOH if it goes down I would probably share a lot more lol
 MSmits: strength in numbers
 reCurse: Catch 22
 MSmits: If it does go down, maybe somewhere it will pop back up in another form
 MSmits: I mean there's demand...
 reCurse: Doubt it
 reCurse: It's living off benevolent money
 MSmits: true
 reCurse: No idea how that's possible tbh
 eulerscheZahl: gocoder has huge goals
 eulerscheZahl: before you ask: this is a troll comment
 MSmits: it's quite special yes, that we can do this and not pay anything
 MSmits: I would pay to do this
 reCurse: Wouldn't put a dent in the costs
 MSmits: sure
 dbdr: benevolent money? isn't the money coming from CG for work?
 reCurse: I meant in the sense of
 reCurse: They put money with no hope of return on it
 Wontonimo: speaking of paying, if there was a multi that we made that we wanted to run like a competition here on CG, we could do a gofundme to raise some ad money to bring contestants, and program the ref to stop at a date/time
 ZarthaxX: true
 jacek: it comes from slavery
 eulerscheZahl: it's not only the server costs (which surely takes a huge part). it's also a few staff members that work partially or mostly on the competitive part of CG
 reCurse: So it's out of their good will is what I meant
 MSmits: hmm but isnt the size of the community a selling point for CG for work?
 MSmits: it's good advertising to be able to say
 reCurse: I doubt it's worth that much
 dbdr: and CG is great advertising for CG for work. plus I don't think it's *that* expensive in comparison to the advertising
 MSmits: i have no idea
 reCurse: But if I knew better I'd do business
 reCurse: So don't mind my rambling
 reCurse: Either they cut a huge deal with their cloud provider
 reCurse: Or I don't know
 reCurse: Running that many games on the cloud isn't cheap
 Wontonimo: no it aint
 dbdr: I don't know, 99% of bots must be if bots, not that CPU heavy
 struct: it aint cheap at all
 kovi: dbdr...get ready to stop submit when i reach #4
 reCurse: It's not about CPU heaviness
 reCurse: It's about time rental
 reCurse: Doesn't matter if the CPU is used or not
 MSmits: dbdr i think 99% of the cost is from 1&#160;% of the players :P
 struct: Running 400k games costed me 20$
 dbdr: kovi why?
 eulerscheZahl: struct used AWS for 3h and got a bill of $6.27 already
 struct: no it was more euler
 Marchete: 6$?
 eulerscheZahl: what even more that $6?
 struct: it didnt updated
 Marchete: what a steal
 ZarthaxX: D:
 struct: It was 6$ for the start
 Marchete: use spot instances
 kovi: oh, saelyos is resubmitting as well, nvm
 eulerscheZahl: you gave me the wrong number. i trusted you
 reCurse: I don't know if OVH has spot instances
 struct: but 400k games for 18$ is not bad
 reCurse: Anyway
 reCurse: All speculation
 reCurse: Gotta add the salaries of the staff involved too
 eulerscheZahl: you only stored the end results. not the full replay
 reCurse: Opportunity cost
 reCurse: etc
 eulerscheZahl: with extra network bandwidth the view them
 struct: ah true, and I used my own referee which was faster
 dbdr: how many games is a CG contest, would you say?&#160;:)
 Marchete: or batch in azure
 Marchete: for massive parallelized jobs
 reCurse: dbdr That's a good question, I'd be curious, I imagine there's a lot more than submits
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud wrote something a year ago
 ZarthaxX: dbdr cant you check that with replay id before a contest and after?
 Marchete: once up and running it was cool
 Marchete: source: me in NS
 MSmits: on the order of several million games i think
 eulerscheZahl: 5 million battles for spring 2020
 reCurse: If it was cheap they wouldn't have been so opposed to running more games and similar requests
 dbdr: and 400k was 6$ :D
 ZarthaxX: :D wtf
 struct: no 18
 reCurse: Just something to keep in mind
 kovi: good guess msmits
 MSmits: so a few 100 $
 Wontonimo: if only it was easy and safe to do something decentralized, like folding@home  .  you get as many plays as your provide cpu
 eulerscheZahl: so if we scale up linear, it's 7 million battles this contest
 MSmits: ye
 dbdr: anyways, pocket change
 MSmits: I would imagine CG bench could be costly if many players use it
 Marchete: ovh maybe don't have preemptive/spot
 reCurse: You think they'd cripple bench if costs were cheap?
 eulerscheZahl: they already surprised me with the 100ms time limit
 Marchete: but I think they should have
 reCurse: They could have just added more servers instead
 reCurse: I'd trust their accounting
 struct: ok $22.61 including taxes
 Marchete: it's a good way to fill cloud VM with low priority batch jobs
 eulerscheZahl: but i guess only a small amount of bots needs more than 2-3ms anyways
 mickeyaxe: i am new to this 
 mickeyaxe: hey 
 Wontonimo: well now that's too much struct
 struct: I had the machine running for about 10 hours +-
 struct: full load for around 4 hours
 Marchete: up to 80% cheaper
 Marchete: and it's real, no marketing BS
 MSmits: I wasted nearly 300$ of free google VM on locam :P
 reCurse: They're on OVH last I heard
 reCurse: I don't know if they have spot instances
 reCurse: It's also subject to availability
 reCurse: You could have days without any instances available
 reCurse: You're ready to have your website down for it?
 Marchete: not all website, but match runners
 reCurse: Still an issue
 dbdr: we found the source of stuck submits :D
 Marchete: high spike? spot instances
 reCurse: Affects plays in IDE too
 kovi: so recurse bot played more games than all of use together
 kovi: no wonder he won&#160;:)
 reCurse: Imagine the chat where you get people asking daily why play doesn't work
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: against itself kovi :P
 eulerscheZahl: so that counts for 2 matches each
 reCurse: Then you need to build the infrastructure to depend on that
 reCurse: If they didn't already, that's more investment
 reCurse: I don't know, I get the impression this is severely underestimated here
 Marchete: I guess
 reCurse: They're not stupid, if it was cheap they'd just add servers
 dbdr: they have a bottleneck
 dbdr: it's not the servers
 MSmits: reCurse you could throttle the number of plays /min when the availability is low. You could do a more expensive minimum availability with the cheap part for extra availability. Like amix
 struct: I think they added during start
 Marchete: I just said preemptive are perfect for short/burst and forgettable jobs
 eulerscheZahl: might this even be the real reason for less contests?
 mickeyaxe: whats the best language 
 Westicles: Definitely seems to be more of a business focus this last year
 reCurse: Maybe I just sympathize because I read reddit comments about gamers thinking they have a clue about what goes on behind the scenes&#160;:)
 reCurse: I try to assume good intentions
 MSmits: mickeyaxe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language</a>
 mickeyaxe: i am new whats the best language 
 Wontonimo: the one you know
 struct: Lua
 mickeyaxe: lol i just got in to this 
 Nerchio: python is a nice language i suggest diving straight into NNs
 MSmits: lol
 Nerchio: so you dont waste any time
 mickeyaxe: do not know what the fuck i am doing but a am ready to learn 
 Wontonimo: what do you mostly code in mickeyaxe (the red text just means you are mentioned, it's not bad)
 struct: red text is a warning
 MSmits: f-word is bad :P
 struct: next is kick followed by ban
 Wontonimo: no it isnt!
 MSmits: i dont mean fun Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: oh no,  i got red text now
 mickeyaxe: lol sorry 
 mickeyaxe: so the paython 
 iHapiW: hi
 mickeyaxe: i will try that 
 eulerscheZahl: it's hard to answer the best language question. we don't even know what you want to achieve. puzzles here on CG, web development, desktop applications, ...
 MSmits: or order food in Italian restaurant
 Nerchio: he wants to do NNs i've heard they can do anything you want
 eulerscheZahl: depending on that you might get a different language suggested. and also depending on whom you ask
 reCurse: What's the best utensil?
 MSmits: fork
 MSmits: easy
 Wontonimo: spork
 struct: why a fork?
 MSmits: why not
 Westicles: lvl 3 US, just say python
 MSmits: you can eat anything with fork
 eulerscheZahl: use freethon. paython is too expensive
 Nerchio: soup would be difficult
 Wontonimo: spork!
 MSmits: thats drinking
 MSmits: the eat part of soup can be done with fork
 reCurse: You eat steak with a fork?
 reCurse: Must make for interesting bites
 MSmits: mmh I am vegetarian apparently
 MSmits: but sure, i would try
 Wontonimo: grind one side of the spork to a  razor edge, then eat  your steak
 MSmits: you can eat steak with two forks
 Smelty: smart
 eulerscheZahl: the answer is "Swiss army knife"
 Westicles: I'm amazed at two-handed steak eaters.  I'm a right hand knift, right hand fork guy
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a tofu steak guy
 Wontonimo: you cut your  meat with 1 hand?
 Westicles: lots of switching
 Smelty: cool'st
 MSmits: I actually havent used a fork in months
 MSmits: maybe i miss it, not sure
 eulerscheZahl: how do you eat then?
 Smelty: chopstic
 Wontonimo: is it because of the nightmares&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: my default is fork+spoon
 MSmits: I live mostly on jimmy joy shakes :P
 dbdr: how the chat topic drifts
 MSmits: but sometimes i get some croissants or some popcorn if i need more calories
 MSmits: still no fork needed
 reCurse: I'll take responsibility on that one
 dbdr: :D
 Marchete: from NN, to cloud servers to tofu
 eulerscheZahl: all it takes is one guy asking for the best language
 MSmits: yep :0
 reCurse: I derail enough chats I'd probably make a living off derailing trains
 dbdr: if there was a market for that
 Smelty: lol
 Wontonimo: with the competition  there is
 eulerscheZahl: trains... used to take one with my grandma to go to bath
 jacek: openttd eh
 jacek: trains in germany :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: in a city a bit away, was a trip for the whole day
 Smelty: eh
 reCurse: ^ case in point ^
 eulerscheZahl: i did that one on purpose
 reCurse: :P
 MSmits: that was disturbing 
 MSmits: :P
 Smelty: ^
 dbdr: most disturbing was learning poor euler did not have a bath at home
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Shower is enough
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, is "bath" the wrong word?
 dbdr: shower was when it rained
 MSmits: it's a good word eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: public swimming bath
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl on purpose too
 MSmits: ohh, then no
 dbdr: I know what you meant
 MSmits: swimming pool
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dict.cc/?s=schwimmbad">https://www.dict.cc/?s=schwimmbad</a>
 MSmits: zwembad in Dutch
 jacek: bad
 Nerchio: its better to have a shower and no bath than have a bath and no shower imo :D
 dbdr: there are hot public baths not for swimming
 MSmits: yep, bad = bath
 jacek: i thought euler didnt have bath
 MSmits: true Nerchio
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more a shower guy
 reCurse: I miss onsens now...
 eulerscheZahl: haven't been in the bathtub for more than a decade
 MSmits: will we next discuss our kitchen sinks&#160;?
 reCurse: sigh
 dbdr: yeah, Nerchio made me think of japan too
 iHapiW: any iranians there&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, struct kicked them
 MSmits: at least 1
 ZarthaxX: haha
 Nerchio: dbdr never been there, wanted to go but worldwide plague happened
 Nerchio: soonTM
 reCurse: Definitely go there
 reCurse: Best trip of my life
 dbdr: agreed!
 reCurse: My only regret is not going there when I was younger
 reCurse: If only to have more time to go again
 Westicles: Interesting country.  I think their y chromosomes are falling apart, guys getting very weird
 MSmits: thats been happening for a long time
 MSmits: watch conan in Japan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x70z6ua">https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x70z6ua</a>
 Nerchio: i was in south korea though and they have next level toilets
 Nerchio: maybe in japan too i guess

 Nerchio: but I was as surprised by that as when i saw a hole in the ground as a toilet in a mall in China ^.-
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: Westicles :D
 Smelty: lol train your muscles
 Nerchio: we had it all in chat today probably&#160;;)
 Smelty: reeeeeee my code for "roller coaster" passes "very large dataset" but fails "large dataset"
 jacek: hardcoding solutions eh
 Smelty: nope
 Smelty: it was a validator
 Smelty: and once i removed them loggers i got 100%
 Lachrymosa: Hm, the "Reach the silver league" quest map isn't unlocking for me. I got silver in two contests now but it only counts 1/2 
 Smelty: hmm do contests count? i think its bot programming
 Lachrymosa: you may be right, i'll just have to run my contest code in the bot game then
 Astrobytes: Known issue iirc
 Lachrymosa: oh, so is it me not running it again, or should I just note it and move on
 Astrobytes: Think they said it'll be fixed soon
 Smelty: ah yes
 Chainman: totoro
 King_Coda: All right boys
 King_Coda: Surgery today, let's go
 King_Coda: Hype Champ
 Chainman: good luck? 
 AntiSquid: where did you come from?
 King_Coda: I've always been here
 King_Coda: I just took a break from chat for the duration of the contest
 AntiSquid: brain enlargement surgery&#160;?
 King_Coda: That's not a thing
 AntiSquid: augmentation via neural link
 King_Coda: Deus Ex Human Revolution style
 King_Coda: Anyways, back on topic
 King_Coda: I've been practicing a lot with AI bot proggramming recently. Never knew it would be so fun
 King_Coda: After just a few puzzles I'm in the top 10,000
 jacek: youre over 10500
 King_Coda: I also never knew they would be so long... 800+ lines????
 King_Coda: Wait, I dropped?
 King_Coda: I was 9,956 last time I checked 
 jacek: making puzzles would give you only exp no?
 jacek: no ups in ranking
 King_Coda: I don't make puzzles
 King_Coda: I solved them
 jacek: solving*
 ZarthaxX: that doesnt give rank
 King_Coda: Yes it does?
 ZarthaxX: games do
 ZarthaxX: clash of code you mean?
 kovi: jacek you have nn uttt?
 King_Coda: No, I don't do clash of code
 jacek: yes
 ZarthaxX: then you are crazy
 kovi: seems robo has improved, maybe he added nn
 King_Coda: Solving puzzles gives you rank
 ZarthaxX: nope
 King_Coda: Then how did my rank increase after doing puzzles
 King_Coda: :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: did you do contest?
 King_Coda: No
 jacek: clash gives rank
 ZarthaxX: lemme check
 ZarthaxX: he said he didnt do
 King_Coda: I got into gold league on Platinum Rift with my bot
 King_Coda: That's really the only league based activity I did
 ZarthaxX: you did clash
 King_Coda: I never won any though
 ZarthaxX: that doesnt appear King_Coda
 ZarthaxX: the platinum
 ZarthaxX: was that today
 King_Coda: No, it was last week
 ZarthaxX: you dont have to win clashes to gainrank
 ZarthaxX: you didnt do platinum lol
 King_Coda: ...Yes I did
 ZarthaxX: ah its bugged then
 ZarthaxX: might be that one then&#160;:)
 King_Coda: There's a bug now?
 King_Coda: Great, sounds fun
 ZarthaxX: i mean, it shows that you have like 2k points
 ZarthaxX: but only shows spring challenge haha
 King_Coda: I only got into like wood 2 league on the spring challenge
 ZarthaxX: yeah i see that
 ZarthaxX: wood2 is the initial league
 King_Coda: I didn't start actually practicing until after the contest
 jacek: and he got into it. :tada:
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: get legend King_Coda
 King_Coda: My bots only get me to gold
 struct: oh valgrowt h also used chokudai
 Marchete: and ghost trees
 RoboStac: do they do extra spooky shadows?
 Marchete: clever ways to avoid overevaluations
 AntiSquid: expect val to do MCTS DUCT, that's what he did for gocoder
 Marchete: :ghost:
 AntiSquid: so much work around the eval function ...
 AntiSquid: almost makes NN look easy 
 Marchete: lol no
 struct: RoboStac yes but only for the other player
 struct: I mean the ghost trees will still cast shadows
 struct: but only for the other player
 Marchete: it's a way to avoid bad interactions between players, like what he said, a seed after enemy's COMPLETE
 AntiSquid: oh well yes, if you think about it overanalyzing the game to come up with perfect heuristics overall takes an awful lot of effort
 Smelty: Bb
 Marchete: overanalyzing sounds like it isn't needed
 Marchete: in any subject if you are at the highest limit
 Marchete: you need to "overanalyze"
 AntiSquid: it's needed, it's just somewhat wasted effort, less productive
 Marchete: Also zobrist
 Marchete: in fact reading it I overanalyzed more than that
 Marchete: I had a lot of tables and stats
 Marchete: didn't work out btw :D
 jacek: my code works faster than i anticipated and i dont know why&#160;:(
 struct: how is that bad?
 jacek: because i cant reproduce it to other codes
 jacek: or i do the same but dont get that speedup
 struct: bug?
 jacek: works correctly
 jacek: the change made this part 6x faster, when i suspected at most 2x
 jacek: could be less cache misses or something
 HaadiFarooq123: which launage do you use
 HaadiFarooq123:&#160;?

 ZarthaxX: duck tape
 Xoast: how many people are bots for clash of code
 jacek: yes
 Xoast: wait so its all bots
 Smelty: coc bots are generally level 7 and no bio and if you click on their profile itll say that they are bots&#160;:)
 Smelty: the rest arent

 rmney: suuuup
 King_Coda: Alright, going to my surgery now
 King_Coda: Let's goooo. Gonna do some bot programming when I come back
 im_brutus: hi
 AntiSquid: are you not gone yet? King_Coda
 AntiSquid: thought it was hours ago
 AntiSquid: no idea what surgery he's having, hope he took a book or something with him, it's really boring for patients when they recover 
 struct: dental
 AntiSquid: ouch, might not even get solid food for a while 
 struct: i just started reading about NNs, can layers have different number of neurons from eachother?
 AntiSquid: yes ofc
 struct: ok makes sense
 struct: I just that most of pictures just all layers with the same number of neurons
 AntiSquid: ya all tutorials seem to mimic each other
 jacek: really?
 struct: really to which part jacek?
 AntiSquid: he's trollyloly again
 struct: ...
 jacek: "most of pictures just all layers with the same number of neurons"

 AntiSquid: oh f... Automaton2000 time
 Automaton2000: because they are the only way i can get it to work
 struct: thanks will check
 AntiSquid: struct check my paste bin
 AntiSquid: ok
 struct: So many terms o.o
 reCurse: Better get used to it
 struct: yeah, I guess at the start is a bit overwhelming
 CamTheHelpDesk: do you get XP from CoC?
 struct: no
 CamTheHelpDesk: is there a list somewhere of what you get XP from and how much
 MSmits: I actually use that playground in class
 MSmits: you can turn most of it off, make it simple
 MSmits: I used iframes where i turn stuff off and i gradually turn it on as my students progress
 MSmits: works quite well
 KelvinAndHubbles: CamTheHelpDesk, if you go to the practice problems and hover over each it says xp values and if you go to acheivements tab it shows all xp values of that, and that's mostly what you'll get xp from
 AntiSquid: there are even more terms
 CamTheHelpDesk: KelvinAndHubbles: thanks

 struct: it shows people that registered
 struct: not that submited
 Uljahn: aropan: guess some finished earlier and then had additional matches with those who didn't
 struct: ah games
 AntiSquid: seen the totoro tags&#160;?     Graphs
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: what
 AntiSquid: what did you use for totoro&#160;?
 aropan: Uljahn: ok, but why I see for reCurse 33 number of games versus Saelyos, but for Saelyos I see only 31 number of games versus reCurse?
 ZarthaxX: beam
 AntiSquid: smart baer
 jacek: :beers:
 ZarthaxX: just followed the herd :P
 AntiSquid: you got higher than mbits
 jacek: to get higher than dutch, oh my
 AntiSquid: not any dutch
 ZarthaxX: smito?
 AntiSquid: yes
 ZarthaxX: ah yeah, but he didnt have the time
 UUolfo: last game I did I printed the anwser, and it showed in the output, but it just said "Nothing" as my anwser?
 aropan: Uljahn: first and fifth games for reCurse are versus Saelyos, but they skip for Saelyos.
 ZarthaxX: he would have smashed me&#160;:)

 ZarthaxX: lol struct :P
 KelvinAndHubbles: UUolfo there are specific rules for languages, for instance c++ you have to put cout &lt;&lt; answer &lt;&lt; endl; as the endl is signyfying you submitting your answer
 reCurse: aropan: Sorry I don't understand your question
 AntiSquid: he is talking about replay history, saying 2 replays don't show up on one of the player's history
 struct: he means some replays on last battle dont show on some players side
 reCurse: Oh
 reCurse: Because the replay history is cut off after a certain number
 reCurse: And some bots had longer submits than others
 AntiSquid: can playgrounds only be created on tech.io&#160;?
 reCurse: A lot more games were played after contest is over than is shown in history
 MSmits: ZarthaxX i did spend quite a bit of time, you beat me fair
 MSmits: i dont always do well you know :P
 aropan: Hmmm, ok, I understood. Thanks.
 ZarthaxX: MSmits okey haha
 ZarthaxX: i take it&#160;:)
 MSmits: you should
 MSmits: it's a 7k contest, not bad at all
 ZarthaxX: can i put this on cv?
 MSmits: sure :P
 ZarthaxX: yeah, it was a tough one
 AntiSquid: do it lol
 ZarthaxX: really fun having so much ppl
 ZarthaxX: nah i should put i beated toad once
 ZarthaxX: :D
 reCurse: "Beat MSmits in a CG competition"?
 ZarthaxX: right
 reCurse: I'm sure that will turn some eyes
 reCurse: Not sure in which direction though
 ZarthaxX: smits and euler
 MSmits: you beat euler too?
 ZarthaxX: not here
 struct: oh now we are talking
 ZarthaxX: on wondev woman
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: euler is really consistent
 AntiSquid: just 57/7000 is enough lol
 ZarthaxX: but he hated that game :P
 Altruister: gibberish
 ZarthaxX: yeah AntiSquid :rofl: wasnt it 56 tho ah
 struct: you are not wrong
 MSmits: well  I beat tourist at code a la mode :P
 MSmits: along with like 40 people :P
 UUolfo: @KelvinAndHubbles I belive it was just a gltich, for python it always reads as print(x) is the anwser. It may have been the way it was programmed, but every other thing i've done it has worked normally.
 ZarthaxX: MSmits OH GOD
 ZarthaxX: that name will be recognized anywhere for sure&#160;:)
 MSmits: i guess he did not spend more than a few hrs 
 MSmits: or maybe did not like cooperative format
 ZarthaxX: he spends usually a few hours yes

 OBenjOne: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c371bdc9-85ec-4b3d-8c1b-5246065e9100">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c371bdc9-85ec-4b3d-8c1b-5246065e9100</a>
 OBenjOne: well that was weird
 OBenjOne: I guess there is a character limit
 OBenjOne: what I said was:
 OBenjOne: Hi, I am trying to learn how to use breadth first search for games (specifically hypersonic).  My code works, to an extent, but for some reason it is only reaching around 300 nodes (or about depth 3 or 4) before timing out.
 OBenjOne: I expected my code to be able to do more calculations than that.  Granted, I am using python because that is the language I understand best and I am new to BFS, but I thought the number of calculations possible would be closer to the thousands than the hundreds.
 ZarthaxX: python is really slow OBenjOne
 OBenjOne: but is it that slow?
 ZarthaxX: yep
 jacek: hypersonic is 100ms?
 ZarthaxX: and depends also on how you code with it
 ZarthaxX: maybe your code is really inefficient
 ZarthaxX: like your simulator
 ZarthaxX: jacek i think it is
 OBenjOne: It probably is
 ZarthaxX: OBenjOne are you copying the sim?
 ZarthaxX: the state
 ZarthaxX: every time
 jacek: python could go into thousands nodes, depending on how efficient is your node traversal
 jacek: or creating/reallocating nodes
 OBenjOne: Is using classes a bad idea?
 OBenjOne: That could be my main problem
 jacek: that one is good actually
 jacek: but what is in that class how it interacts with others
 OBenjOne: Each node has just a few paramiters, two being another class object (one for my bot and one for the map of the game)
 OBenjOne: Would condensing each node to one object help?
 Dower: Talking about timeouts. I wrote some methods with js for 2021 event, which calculated best places with least shadows and it timedout. It was so dissapointing...
 ZarthaxX: you have a node class?
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: nvm
 OBenjOne: yes
 ZarthaxX: bfs true
 OBenjOne: yes
 ZarthaxX: so are you copying each map bot?
 ZarthaxX: every time 
 ZarthaxX: i guess you are
 ZarthaxX: so copying may make it slow
 OBenjOne: yeah.... thats probably bad isn't it
 ZarthaxX: your map representation is heavy  probably
 ZarthaxX: nah it's ok, bfs need that
 ZarthaxX: copying is fine
 ZarthaxX: but the copy might be killing you, because your states may be too big
 OBenjOne: So I need to find a way to condense them?
 ZarthaxX: c++ has 20x more speed than python btw
 ZarthaxX: there are ways to make it smaller yes
 ZarthaxX: maybe you have a matrix of ints here, right?
 OBenjOne: Yeah I looked at the leaderboard and all the top players use C++
 ZarthaxX: each int indetifies the type
 ZarthaxX: yeah because c++ rocks with these type of things
 OBenjOne: I just don't know C++ well enough yet
 OBenjOne: I plan to switch to it later
 ZarthaxX: try learning it
 OBenjOne: thanks
 ZarthaxX: will help you
 ZarthaxX: in this game, represnting the board with a bitboard is nice
 ZarthaxX: you can try doing the excercise with python
 ZarthaxX: representing state with bits, each cell is a bit
 ZarthaxX: for exampl,e each set bit means there is a box
 mubi97: hey there

 OBenjOne: Thanks @ZarthaxX I had to leave for a bit because I am at school, but I think your advice about bitboards and c++ will help a lot
 ZarthaxX: sure
 ZarthaxX: you can read postmortems about hypersonic for a guide too

 King_Coda: Wisdom teeth
 LeviathanProgramming: seriously
 CamTheHelpDesk: uh
 CamTheHelpDesk: you have 4 wisdom teeth
 King_Coda: I still have the bloddy cloths in my mouth
 CamTheHelpDesk: gonna be like that for a few days unfortunately
 King_Coda: Yayyyyyyyyyyyy
 King_Coda: Damn, mine came out early
 LeviathanProgramming: I had to remove four premolars and an extra tooth that wasn't supposed to be in my mouth
 CamTheHelpDesk: ngl I'm surprised you're sane enough to chat rn
 King_Coda: Oh, the drugs wore off a LONG time ago
 CamTheHelpDesk: I got mine out a few weeks ago, couldn't think straight for the rest of the day
 CamTheHelpDesk: were you sedated?
 King_Coda: Yeha, I can think perfectly now
 King_Coda: I was sedated
 King_Coda: UNconcious
 King_Coda: It felt like I fast travelled

 LelouchVC2: I heard peer pressure was a bad thing&#160;:((
 LelouchVC2: Why would you make me cry like this
 AntiSquid: why not&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: I thought we had something special
 King_Coda: oh god
 King_Coda: what the hell is wrong with chat
 LelouchVC2: I was getting bullied&#160;:((

 LelouchVC2: You get beat up today?
 King_Coda: I got surgery
 LelouchVC2: oof
 LelouchVC2: What was it for?
 King_Coda: My jaw
 King_Coda: Had my wisdom teeth growing in sideways
 LelouchVC2: Ahh yes
 LelouchVC2: I have one sideways wisdom tooth
 LelouchVC2: I'll be in your shoes one day
 King_Coda: They knocked me out, and I dont remember a single thing from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM
 King_Coda: How old are you?
 quakity: ngl im kinda shit at this im still on episode one and i've never coded
 King_Coda: I'm only 16 and just got mine removed
 LelouchVC2: Yea, it doesn't seem to be hurting anything though so I'm thinking maybe I could just leave it
 LelouchVC2: I'm in my 20s
 King_Coda: HA
 King_Coda: You should be acting more mature if you're in your 20s
 LelouchVC2: They've been there a while, i only need 1 removed
 LelouchVC2: Says who?
 King_Coda: Says literally everyone
 LelouchVC2: unless im not someone, it cannot be literally everyone
 LelouchVC2: big brain
 quakity: sheeesh
 King_Coda: If I'm more mature than you and I've not even fully developed yet, then thats a probkem
 King_Coda: I doubt you're in your 20s, but okay
 LelouchVC2: u came into a chat after surgery complaining right off the bat. I dont think being mature would be the highest priority on ur list
 LelouchVC2: You should get some sleep
 King_Coda: I think I have the right to complain after getting my face ripped open
 King_Coda: I'm not tired.
 LelouchVC2: You have every right to do it even if you're jolly and had the best day of your life
 AntiSquid: LelouchVC2 ban&#160;!
 LelouchVC2:&#160;:((
 King_Coda: Please
 AntiSquid: you ripped his face open
 LelouchVC2: AntiSquid actually loves me
 LelouchVC2: He's just too shy 
 King_Coda: Astro bytes is my dad, he just doesnt want to admit it
 AntiSquid: idk i want to kick both
 King_Coda: "I have never sired an american child" - Astro
 LelouchVC2: I have never bit into someone's neck pretending to be a vampire
 King_Coda: Antisquid, I don't really care what you do tbh. I'm just gonna go do some more puzzles
 LelouchVC2: Don't talk to my mother that way
 King_Coda: See you all later
 LelouchVC2: Have fun, movies are your friend
 AntiSquid: king coda is overly dramatic imo
 AntiSquid: also you jump the shark with your jokes LelouchVC2
 AntiSquid: the shark's balls to put it your way
 quakity: Do ya'll have any recomendations on what i can do to actually learn how to code bc im legit barely a freshman and half to take a programming class next year lmao
 quakity: have*
 AntiSquid: practice
 LelouchVC2: Figure out which programming language you'll be learning in your university
 casmith789: try the easy puzzles and google how to do things when you get stuck
 LelouchVC2: Find a tutorial for it for beginner programmers
 dreadylein: work through some basic tutorials, then pratice by doing something you think is fun
 quakity: im in highschool lmao
 AntiSquid: what stage are you at? what do you know about your language you use&#160;? quakity 
 quakity: idk i just started today and im using Go
 LelouchVC2: I think I'll bring you to the dark side instead @antisquid
 CameronWatt: c# ide being weird
 King_Coda: C# is superior
 King_Coda: Stick with the C languages, including Java and Javascript
 CameronWatt: &gt;_&gt;
 King_Coda: And python too
 LelouchVC2: Javascript = best language every made
 AntiSquid: lol 
 quakity: lol i honestly don't know the difference yet
 LelouchVC2: python is the fastest language iv ever programmed in
 King_Coda: LOL
 AntiSquid: i loled at the "Stick with the C languages, including Java and Javascript"
 King_Coda: (I was joking btw)
 Notter: Why is the code editor not showing the usual yellow and red spots on the scroll bar?
 quakity: I feel like a tard I haven't even gotten to my 2nd test case
 LelouchVC2: You'll be fine, you just have to keep at it 
 AntiSquid: take it easy
 CameronWatt: ide/editor seems to be wonky today Notter
 LelouchVC2: Its slow learning at first, but it gets better over time
 quakity: I mean ik that I have to write a function I just don't know how to and i don't wanna look it up
 LelouchVC2: What I did at first is I kept notes in a notepad with coding examples. If I needed references I'd go ctrl+f through it
 LelouchVC2: And believe me, no matter how good you get, you'll have to google examples sometimes just because you wont have a whole language memorized
 quakity: # A single line providing the move to be made: N NE E SE S SW W or NW
 LelouchVC2: Follow a tutorial that's meant for first time programmers. After a couple days of going through it, come back and try the puzzle
 quakity: lol ok
 CameronWatt: step 1: open challenge. step 2: smash head on keyboard multiple times. step 3: click submit. step 4:&#160;???. step 5: profit
 LelouchVC2: Cameron, I'm proud to nominate you for vice president
 CameronWatt: Lol
 n1j4t: Hi
 scorcersucks: join clash in code baby
 scorcersucks: be a chad and join
 scorcersucks: :grinning:
 n1j4t: I have a question regarding IDE
 n1j4t: I am new to codingame
 n1j4t: I want to pass a test and codingame says I can use my preferred IDE but if I do I will be copy pasting from there, does it count as cheating?
 n1j4t: When I finished the tutorial I watched the screen capture of how I did and whenever I pasted code from IDE it showed it in red that I pasted from external sources
 n1j4t: I dont understand what the use of an external IDE is if copy pasting from it is considered a red flag
 MuddySneakers: I use an external IDE all the time. But you shouldn't have to copy&amp;paste. Click Settings, at the bottom, there's an option for "Use an external code editor". If you turn that on, you get a widget that allows you to pick a file on your local system. You can directly upload/download to the file. Once it's synced, edit the file in your favorite IDE. When you save, the sync updates CodinGame's copy.
 New_coder_please_help: does my new username show up here?
 New_coder_please_help: nice
 IDKwhatmynicknameshouldbe: yes New_coder_please_help
 New_coder_please_help: I love it
 New_coder_please_help: I shall feint all of the peoples
 n1j4t: @MuddySneakers but where is this setting, I cannot find it
 MuddySneakers: When you are working on a problem, there's a settings button on the left. Click that, at the bottom of the widget is the setting. You may have to scroll.
 MuddySneakers: You do have to re-set it up each time you return to a particular problem or start a new problem. It's only live for the current session.
 n1j4t: do I need some kind of browser extension? Because I still cant find this setting
 MuddySneakers: Not that I know of.
 MuddySneakers: Do you see the panel on the left w/ Back, Forum, Results, Leaderboard, Settings?
 n1j4t: ok I actually meant the test session like an interview or the one that codingame provides to advertise you for 30 min, not the problems in a puzzle or something
 MuddySneakers: Note: You have to be currently working on solving a problem/writing a bot to see this.
 n1j4t: ok not sure about advertisement part but something like a test session, or interview request from a company
 MuddySneakers: Ah, I don't know anything about interviews, as I never use that part of codingame. Sorry.
 n1j4t: I just had a look at one problem and codingame IDE looks different
 n1j4t: ok, no problem, thanks anyway
 King_Coda: Opiods
 King_Coda: They have me taking opioids
 King_Coda: Great.
 King_Coda: Welp, guess I'll just figure out why my stupid nn isn't working
 King_Coda: Why am I saying this in world chat?
 LelouchVC2: Because at some point
 LelouchVC2: You became too mature to keep it all inside
 New_coder_please_help: is there a way that I can specify that I want to participate in a reverse clash?
 New_coder_please_help: I can't seem to get any
 LelouchVC2: no, fully random
 LelouchVC2: I think there might be a way if you're doing a custom game
 nacho_cheesefries: Hello!
 New_coder_please_help: howdy
 Smelty: how'dy
 New_coder_please_help: yasss, I got my 3 reverse clashes won
 New_coder_please_help: finally
 New_coder_please_help: only took me about a week
 JohnCM: i'm playing all my clash of code in C++ now, even shortest
 JohnCM: just as a challenge
 Cobra_Mayhem: does anyone know where to do basic commands or use parameters?
 Smelty: ahm, what language?
 Cobra_Mayhem: go
 Smelty: welp idk go
 Cobra_Mayhem: do you know any that does
 Smelty: well
 Smelty: maybe you can look for profiles with go as a language
 Cobra_Mayhem: no i meant do you know any languages that use bc
 Smelty: um no
 Smelty: also, woah euler is first one global leaderboard
 BlackDereker: can I print debug info in Bot Programming?
 Wontonimo: well, think of it this way Smelty, you've already surpassed over 200,000 other people on the leader board yourself, how hard could another 1418 people positions really be?  you can do it!
 Wontonimo: yes BlackDereker you can
 Wontonimo: the default code usually has an example of how to do it
 BlackDereker: I deleted the default code...
 BlackDereker: oh I can restore it
 BlackDereker: nvm
 BlackDereker: thx
 Wontonimo: no problem, you can get it back (make sure you save it first)
 Wontonimo: what multi bot game are you playing?
 BlackDereker: the race one
 BlackDereker: Coders Strike Back I think
 Wontonimo: oh cool.  how are you doing with it?
 BlackDereker: I'm on Silver League
 Wontonimo: congrats!
 BlackDereker: thx
 Wontonimo: you must have all the rules now, 2 vs 2, thrusting, shields,
 BlackDereker: 2vs2?
 Wontonimo: do you have 2 pods and the enemy has 2?
 BlackDereker: nope
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: what's the url?
 BlackDereker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back</a>
 Wontonimo: oh, you still just have 1 pod?
 BlackDereker: yeah
 Wontonimo: oh cool
 BlackDereker: I just got the shield
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: do you want any help?
 BlackDereker: that would be cheating, no?
 Wontonimo: if i send you code it is, but if I use words and just describe the problem at a high level it is totally okay
 BlackDereker: hmm
 BlackDereker: I'm just thinking how I'm going to use the shield
 Wontonimo: i'd only be repeating what you'd be able to find in the "discussion" tab, nothing more
 BlackDereker: if it's going to be for defense or attack
 Wontonimo: it is about being fast
 Wontonimo: oh, you are in the top 1/3 of silver!  Very nice
 BlackDereker: thxx
 BlackDereker: but I didn't submit my shield version, I think it used my previous one
 Smelty: o.O

 KiwiTae: struct yeah its anoying &gt;,&lt; we had to postpone release to optimise performance on nintendo switch
 KiwiTae: MadKnight i will have a free copy i hope ~
 cegprakash: I just thought of a way to find mine probability in OOC
 cegprakash: say if opponent places a mine in a particular turn and I guess he can be at 10 positions at that instant, then he can place mine in 4 directions from each of it's positions i.e. probaility of placing mine in all these 40 positions will be 1/40
 cegprakash: I can use this probability to decide whether to be scared of this location or not
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash you can't make me play topcoder and then not compete yourself
 cegprakash: I did
 cegprakash: it's not updated in website yet
 cegprakash: oh wait it's updated

 cegprakash: I have never took part in Marathon
 cegprakash: I don't know the marathon event format
 cegprakash: never tried
 eulerscheZahl: wow, a lot of participations
 cegprakash: I only do SRMs
 eulerscheZahl: what's the thing you are competing at?
 eulerscheZahl: what's SRM?
 cegprakash: algorithm contest
 cegprakash: single round match
 eulerscheZahl: ah, like codejam/codeforces
 cegprakash: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely do those
 cegprakash: can u teach me marathon
 cegprakash: how to compete
 eulerscheZahl: you register and then submit your code
 cegprakash: is it possible to practice
 cegprakash: like now
 cegprakash: i logged into the applet
 eulerscheZahl: just do it. participation is the best practice
 eulerscheZahl: i'm using the website
 cegprakash: did u register for TCO
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: i'm completely lost on their website
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tco20.topcoder.com/">https://tco20.topcoder.com/</a>
 cegprakash: go into regional events
 eulerscheZahl: bookmarked the marathon section
 cegprakash: actually u can also login into topcoder arena and register
 cegprakash: active contests -&gt; register
 eulerscheZahl: that algo track isn't really my cup of tea
 cegprakash: you know petr, tourist and all?
 cegprakash: they are world toppers
 eulerscheZahl: and using the website already is the first challenge
 eulerscheZahl: of course i know who they are
 cegprakash: there is TCO for marathon too
 cegprakash: I'll be competing in southern asia regionals this year
 cegprakash: how do I submit code for that Rotating numbers challenge
 cegprakash: where is the submit button?
 cegprakash: okay found it
 eulerscheZahl: exactly: hard to find anything
 eulerscheZahl: now you will get 4 emails
 eulerscheZahl: we received your submission
 eulerscheZahl: you passed the virus test
 eulerscheZahl: you have a score of 1 until we processed your submit
 eulerscheZahl: and your final score is ...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/s61tsl">https://prnt.sc/s61tsl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and now we are first as that's our virus test result and not the actual score :D
 cegprakash: there should be a folder inside the zip?
 cegprakash: I mistakenly uploaded the zip with the file directly
 eulerscheZahl: that's fine
 eulerscheZahl: and the filename has to be exactly as given in the example submission
 eulerscheZahl: there's a test submission for each language
 eulerscheZahl: and don't use cerr
 cegprakash: "Please Note: Please zip only the file. Do not put it inside a folder before zipping, you should directly zip the file."
 cegprakash: how do I run this
 cegprakash: java -jar tester.jar -exec "&lt;command&gt;" -seed &lt;seed&gt;
 cegprakash: oh i need to generate an exe
 cegprakash: how do I generate an exe ;O
 cegprakash: he time limit is 10 seconds per test cas
 cegprakash: woah
 cegprakash: time to do simu
 cegprakash: :D
 eulerscheZahl: was afk for breakfast, did you solve your compilation problem?
 cegprakash: no I was helping WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: for CSB
 cegprakash: for his eval
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: I was able to run local tester
 cegprakash: my exe file generated in debug folder
 cegprakash: so I use that to test
 POSEnough: does anyone has text about MPI programming?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=mpi+programming">https://lmgtfy.com/?q=mpi+programming</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 2h to get a link to google. i know a faster way to use a search engine
 Crypticsy: are you guys free enough to give a peek to my 5 min contribution? 
 AntiSquid: nope
 aCat: honest but brutal ;p
 eulerscheZahl: no, the honest answer is "i have time but i don't want to"
 Nerchio: the honest answer is i can do it in 3 mins but my lvl is 11 so whats the point
 Nerchio: can't approve or disaprove below 20 :D
 JBM: free peek needs no level
 Crypticsy: *slowly crawls back to the den*
 aCat: ^^'
 Nerchio: gold boss in ghost in the cell&#160;:( so strong
 YurkovAS: AntiSquid do you use dfs in evaluation for tron battle multi?
 MSmits: I doubt that YurkovAS
 MSmits: mostly it will be some form of minimax with floodfill I think
 MSmits: but I am not high ranked on tron, so someone may correct me
 MSmits: btw, Onitama has huge rps effects
 MSmits: I already found a version of my bot that beats karlis o. But it's less good vs darkhorse
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60afee38-88ab-4b3a-9b0a-aca82acd710f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60afee38-88ab-4b3a-9b0a-aca82acd710f</a>
 MSmits: that 1 crash was Jacek... probably his assumption pass doesn't happen :P
 jacek: my crash?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well it's the 1 crash in the cg bench and it's you who did it, but may be a fluke timeout. Server hiccups
 MSmits: It's really just like oware... small tweaks in the eval makes my bot very strong vs 1 player and weak vs another player. Last night I had 1 version that chain-lost vs Renard, but not vs anyone else
 MSmits: I can probably pick a player and make him nr 1 or 2 if i start recording which version beats whom
 dbdr: Illedan, was any boss harmed in the making of your promotion?
 MSmits: where did he promote?
 dbdr: Tulips and daisies
 MSmits: oh cool
 MSmits: how do you write a search for that game?
 MSmits: seems hard to do
 MSmits: so many choices
 jacek: dutch should know something about tulips
 MSmits: not this one&#160;:)
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: not yet
 dbdr: still investigating it
 MSmits: did you do langtons ant dbdr?
 dbdr: so far it seems minimax is on top
 MSmits: it has similar branching
 dbdr: MSmits not yet
 MSmits: I was able to make mcts work for langtons, but only because there was a very clear/logical pruning rule available
 dbdr: and EricSMSO mentioned his MCTS on Tulips was weak, but that it might have been an implementation issue
 MSmits: Some pruning rules are obvious with tulips and daisies, but I don't see enough of them to reduce the branching to a manageable level
 dbdr: what pruning would be obvious to you?
 dbdr: apart from planting on yourself&#160;:)
 MSmits: place your flower within a certain distance of other flowers
 MSmits: dont just go in the middle of nowhere
 MSmits: or if you do, do it by heuristic
 dbdr: I think soon that will be everywhere
 MSmits: yes, thats why i said its not enough&#160;:)
 dbdr: if certain distance is not too small
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: in some ways it reminds me of go
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: though I know little about go
 MSmits: which means mcts could work
 dbdr: and in go it even makes sense to play far from the rest of the pieces
 dbdr: IIUC
 MSmits: hm ok
 dbdr: to start influencing that territory
 MSmits: well this sort of question will answer itself when better bots get submitted
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: I'm not particularly drawn to the game
 MSmits: but will visit it eventually I think
 dbdr: visual style or the rules?
 MSmits: rules, visual doesnt matter much to me
 MSmits: though if it's good it's a nice bonus
 MSmits: I like games with less branching
 MSmits: do some deep searching
 MSmits: in T&amp;D it's all about eval, since you can forget about depth
 dbdr: it's a different challenge definitely
 dbdr: but good that we have games that differ in this fundamental way
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: so that we can learn better to deal with various situations
 MSmits: once I am done with my AI assignment, I will continue to work on STC
 dbdr: what approaches work or not
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: my knowledge is mostly lacking in optimization games
 dbdr: single player optim?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: stuff you can't treesearch
 dbdr: that's definitely a different category again&#160;:)
 dbdr: it's still a tree
 dbdr: you just don't have an opponent
 MSmits: sometimes it isn't a tree
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: say like number shifting
 MSmits: or travelling salesman
 MSmits: you mutate a solution
 MSmits: that's completely different
 dbdr: you can still see it as a tree
 MSmits: it's a sequence of moves
 jacek: everything can be tree if youre brave enough
 AntiSquid: what about puzzles MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: but sure at every move you considered other moves and they're all part of the tree
 dbdr: a sequence of moves is one path in the tree&#160;:)
 MSmits: what kind of puzzles AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: sometimes i go out in the garden barefoot, step on the grass, stretch my hands out and pretend i am a tree jacek
 MSmits: I can solve puzzles ok. I solved pikachu in less than 4 hrs at least
 dbdr: graphs is even more general, e.g. if you consider transpositions your tree becomes a graph
 MSmits: a tree is a onedirectional graph isnt it?
 dbdr: a directed graph with no cycles
 MSmits: oh wait no, you can have multiple paths ot the same node
 MSmits: with a one directional graph
 MSmits: yeah i suppose a minimax with TT is like that
 dbdr: two states can have the same child
 jacek: its called ADG
 MSmits: acyclic directional graph
 dbdr: I know it as DAG :D
 jacek: DAG* -.-
 AntiSquid: diagonally aligned graph
 MSmits: thats what Dutch people say when they leave
 MSmits: it's like bye
 AntiSquid: (bye) da(w)gmakes sense
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Isn't it like saying "good day"?
 AntiSquid: the very hard puzzlys MSmits
 MSmits: probably closer in meaning yes, but it's used when people leave mostly
 MSmits: AntiSquid I didn't try many, but that's mostly because I like multis
 Astrobytes: Good day is a greeting or a parting phrase
 AntiSquid: ya multis are more fun
 MSmits: Astrobytes true
 AntiSquid: multis are like very hard puzzles but you only do as much as you like of the puzzle
 MSmits: mmh it says i completed 3 very hard but I doubt they are really very hard
 dbdr: like very hard puzzles that you can never fully solve&#160;:)

 MSmits: those are the ones I completed. They all seem medium at most...
 dbdr: I would count only official CG ones as very hard
 AntiSquid: at least bandas and oware got to be fully solvable with NN
 MSmits: oware is not fully solvable the way it's coded on CG because of loops
 MSmits: there are rules that deal with this in other versions of the game. Then it would be solvable
 AntiSquid: how many ML experts are there on CG?
 AntiSquid: 0
 AntiSquid: afaik
 dbdr: right, simpler multis might be at the edge of solvability
 dbdr: but you might be able to solve them offline and not be able to fit the solution in 100K
 MSmits: solving has a pretty precise meaning though, if you say a NN can solve a game, it still has to consider all opponent choices
 MSmits: so you can write a perfect NN and it may still be out of reach
 dbdr: yes,  NN is a function approximator
 dbdr: if you have a perfect solution, there is probably a more compact representation for it
 AntiSquid: if nobody can top it it's solved imo
 dbdr: if nobody can EVER top it
 MSmits: yes, thats the thing
 MSmits: you never know
 dbdr: well, you do if it's actually solved
 AntiSquid: well if nobody can reach higher accuracy then it's good enough ... sort of like the TGD puzzle i guess
 dbdr: like checkers
 MSmits: AntiSquid but how do you know noone can?
 dbdr: TGD was not solved
 dbdr: once you take a decimals into account
 MSmits: just because noone has, doesnt mean noone can
 AntiSquid: but nobody was reaching higher accuracy after a while
 MSmits: what if it happens after 20 years
 dbdr: one player had better score than everyone else
 Nagatwin: I tried to solve it fully with NNs
 dbdr: so max one player solved it, probably no one
 Nagatwin: but failed
 AntiSquid: is CG still around in 20 years?
 Nagatwin: Oware ^
 AntiSquid: maybe it is but who knows
 MSmits: I beat the NN's after obsessive eval experimentation
 dbdr: in checkers, we know. there is a proof / complete search
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: this is a cool story actually
 MSmits: oware has a proof for the version with slightly different rules
 dbdr: this one guy was so much above the rest, then he died before finishing a match against a strong AI
 AntiSquid: i don't get "Breach"
 dbdr: the Ai devs thought the only way to give him respect before saying they would have beaten him was to beat God
 dbdr: e.g. prove perfect play
 dbdr: and they spent like a decade doing that
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: was this Tinsley?
 MSmits: or something?
 dbdr: Marion Tinsley, yes
 MSmits: I also remember reading he wanted to play the best AI in an official championship and the organization refused
 MSmits: then he refused to participate in the championship
 dbdr: World Champion	1955–19581975–1991
 MSmits: so they had to invent a new championship to accomodate him
 MSmits: otherwise it would be worthless
 MSmits: without him in it
 dbdr: In August 1992, he defeated the Chinook computer program &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_(draughts_player)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_(draughts_player)</a>&gt; 4–2 (with 33 draws)
 AntiSquid: i want to see Dota bots that actually win with all heroes available 
 dbdr: wow, so many draws
 MSmits: near perfect play&#160;:)
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/69d268f0-c2ef-4fa2-a0ba-542f9cab2539">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/69d268f0-c2ef-4fa2-a0ba-542f9cab2539</a>
 MSmits: hehe yes, i remember reading that too
 MSmits: it is quite interesting
 Astrobytes: Impressive
 AntiSquid: so like Magnus Carlsen sort of
 MSmits: I think no other sport has a marion tinsley
 MSmits: not the same
 AntiSquid: but if you do only 1 thing your entire life you should be better than the rest no? :p
 MSmits: yes, but even then, this was extreme
 AntiSquid: well it's not the same "sport", but it's comparable
 MSmits: no i mean
 MSmits: the difference between marion and anyone else
 dbdr: I'm sure other people tried very hard too
 AntiSquid: you pile up magnus with anyone else MSmits
 MSmits: no other game/sport has this difference between nr 1 and the rest
 dbdr: by the way have you guys seen the movie about alpha go?
 dbdr: not very technical, mostly the human side of the story
 AntiSquid: classical chess world champions:Magnus Carlsen (2013-current)
 dbdr: the research team and the human players
 Astrobytes: Any good?
 dbdr: I enjoyed it
 Astrobytes: Seems worth a watch
 AntiSquid: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/H0n69pDaUaY?t=94">https://youtu.be/H0n69pDaUaY?t=94</a>
 dbdr: EricSMSO got 40 at Tulips&#160;:)
 dbdr: 40.5
 EricSMSO: Thanks to Illedan, I found a weakness in my evaluation function
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 dbdr: won 77/80&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Well played
 EricSMSO: Thank you. 
 EricSMSO: dbdr. I think MSmits is right. If you restrict to neighbourhood, MCTS should work. Mine was bad because I played complete random
 dbdr: neighbourhood will soon be the whole board no?
 MSmits: sorry was afk a sec
 MSmits: cool EricSMSO
 MSmits: will try it at some point
 EricSMSO: You won't play were your flowers are already
 dbdr: sure, but next to yours + next to opponent + on opponent, that's mostly everywhere
 EricSMSO: True, that's why I rarely reach depth 4
 MSmits: AntiSquid nice trick with the blindfold. Seen fellow students do this (with only one game and playing more poorly)
 MSmits: it's really cool to see. These two guys who just sit on lunch breaks and say chess moves. We werent even sure they were playing until someone brought a board
 AntiSquid: idk what you mean trick
 MSmits: well the blindfold doesn't prove you're a good player, it proves you have good memory. Obviously he is also a good player
 AntiSquid: honestly look up carlsen, quite interesting
 MSmits: hey I believe you
 AntiSquid: it's nothing to do with belief
 AntiSquid: it's more about knowing the individual
 MSmits: allright
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454977165">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454977165</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i like how you announce your victory
 dbdr: RIP
 MSmits: yeah i am testing new versions with bugs&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: testing in production
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i try to win $0 but all the spinning makes me dizzy
 MSmits: huh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30122730?tab=details">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30122730?tab=details</a>there, you can win $0
 MSmits: ahh I see
 MSmits: think I found the bug
 MSmits: if (moveBits[playerIndex] &amp; (masterBitPos[opponent]) &amp;&amp; !lastTurn)
 MSmits: typical bit op bug
 MSmits: can you spot it?
 jacek: no parenthesis?
 MSmits: no there's parenteses
 MSmits: but they are placed wrong
 jacek: thats what i meant
 MSmits: yea.. hard to spot this
 MSmits: &amp; has such a weak priority
 MSmits: always gets me into trouble
 MSmits: mmh still bugged I think
 jacek: good, keep pushing me up
 MSmits: will try&#160;:)
 MSmits: I get this a lot:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454986257">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454986257</a>
 MSmits: solve on frame 18/35 as a loss
 MSmits: then, it gets "unlost"  because he chooses a different path than the one I solved as a win for him
 MSmits: then I lose again :p
 jacek: hes teasing you
 MSmits: maybe&#160;:)
 MSmits: this is what is cool about mcts solver though. Under the right conditions it solves much better than minimax
 dbdr: how so?
 dbdr: ah, you mean better if the opponent is imperfect?
 MSmits: because sometimes statistics guide you better
 MSmits: it doesnt have to explore the entire tree (with or without ab pruning). Just the path that is seemingly best for the winning player
 MSmits: i did say *under the right conditions*
 MSmits: has a lot to do with exploration parameter and such
 dbdr: well, that's one thing with minimax, it assumes perfect opponent
 MSmits: but it gets crazy solves sometimes. I would see karlis o say he got to depth 11 and my bot solved at 15 or something
 dbdr: so it can make you lose against weak players when you could have won
 dbdr: because they make a mistake
 MSmits: mcts might do that too
 MSmits: but it's different
 dbdr: yes, but MCTS will have stats
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: once in a while the opponent will play badly
 dbdr: in minimax never
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454987603">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454987603</a>
 dbdr: minimax does no distinguish lose in 1 turn and lose in 60 turns
 MSmits: look at the replay. I solve it as a loss for me 15 frames before the end
 MSmits: karlis o says d:8
 MSmits: I wondered if this is maybe due to his definition of a depth being 2 plies, but if you continue the game, he keeps using max calc time
 dbdr: what is d /
 dbdr:&#160;?
 dbdr: ah, depth?
 MSmits: I think so
 jacek: what if he puts random value there
 MSmits: of course that is possible
 dbdr: looks consistent with depth
 dbdr: not knowing the game&#160;:)
 dbdr: gets a bit higher need the end
 dbdr: near
 karliso: MSmits I limit my depth to 11...
 MSmits: oh
 dbdr: grats on promotion Quidome!
 MSmits: karliso why to 11?
 karliso: No particular reason
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven</a>
 karliso: Do you thnk MCTs is going to be better?
 MSmits: I don't know
 MSmits: the reason I use mcts is that I suck with minimax
 karliso: Was my first minimax... I find mcts more intuitive.
 MSmits: this game has strong rock paper scissors. I found several versions that have higher than 50% winrate vs you, but then darkhorse beats me
 MSmits: or someone else
 karliso: You tested with -s parameter?
 MSmits: whats that?
 karliso: Ahh, I meant you play position from both isdes?
 MSmits: oh yes, swap and random seed
 karliso: Ok, perhaps my endgames are not so good.
 MSmits: this happened with me on oware too
 MSmits: I could make versions that beat re curse and robo, but only won 60-70% vs the rest
 MSmits: then i submitted it a few times and was nr 1
 MSmits: then other people submitted and i would lose it
 MSmits: karliso your bot is fine
 MSmits: hard to beat
 MSmits: it stays on top when other people submit too, so I wouldnt worry. But you can try mcts if you want
 karliso: I am no gona try mcts in onitama, but I regret going with mcts in bandas.
 MSmits: why?
 MSmits: mcts seems fine in bandas
 MSmits: do remember that nagrarok uses an endgame book
 MSmits: not sure if you do
 MSmits: but that's a major boost
 karliso: It feels to me like it has decent eval + mcts spend a lot of time in big depths + there are some forced lines. 
 MSmits: then use mcts with eval
 MSmits: make your mcts more like minimax&#160;:)
 ALIM: Could anyone help me with an easy puzzle please?? I need some help ta disordered first contact on how to decode the message.
 karliso: What do you propogate?
 karliso: No, I don't use endgame tables in bandas. I am also only 51% vs nagrarok.
 JBM: isn't the format code given in the statement?
 MSmits: karliso you propagate the eval
 MSmits: just make sure it is properly normalized
 MSmits: for example between 0 and 1, or some other value
 ALIM: in the statement there is only the encoding, not the decoding
 karliso: Hmm, interesting. I use ints = 0 as loss, 1 = draw, and 2 = win in my mcts.
 MSmits: thats fine. I use 1, -1 and 0
 MSmits: doesn't really matter
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: I had a bug where my knight blocked my master from reaching shrine
 MSmits: I simply checked all master moves and if the shrine is in there I count it as a win
 MSmits: but if the knight is in the way...
 Adnmaster: is there any way to find our own location in code royale?
 MSmits: it is not given as input?
 Adnmaster: only the location of the sites are given
 MSmits: mmh there are two types of input, initial input and input per turn
 MSmits: are you sure the position is not in the per turn input?
 Adnmaster: i tried x y but i later found out that it wont go in the direction i want
 MSmits: not sure what you mean. We're talking about input here right, not output?
 Adnmaster: i mean, it says x and y is the sites value, and when i make it output, it does return as a sites value
 Adnmaster: so it is a sites value
 Adnmaster: and it would be much better if we could move our character as we want
 MSmits: you can
 Adnmaster: how
 MSmits: let me open code royale, sec
 Adnmaster: ok
 MSmits: been 2 years&#160;:)
 Adnmaster: :D
 MSmits: which league are you in?
 Adnmaster: wood 3 i think
 Adnmaster: wait
 Adnmaster: let me look
 MSmits: ahh, maybe wood 3 doesnt allow free x y movement
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: might be

 MSmits: bronze, silver, gold shoul dbe the same
 MSmits: wood might be different
 darkhorse64: MOVE x y to move the quuen
 Adnmaster: what is the input in those leagues?
 MSmits: but really, if you want to get out of wood, just build barracks and make kngihts
 Adnmaster: yeah

 MSmits: look when it was solved (according to my maybe bugged bot)
 Quidome: funny i have been pushed into wood 1 and into position 4 with tulips
 Quidome: :joy:
 MSmits: nice
 Quidome: well with a crappy solution, but still funny
 Quidome: Top Rust player :muscle:
 Quidome: :sunglasses:
 Quidome: Eric has taken over first place big time
 Quidome: 6 points difference!
 MSmits: nice
 darkhorse64: Strange, my eval goes beyond 1
 MSmits: he does that sometimes&#160;:)
 MSmits: err
 MSmits: in the game i shared darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: I think it's funny my bot keeps seeing a path for you to win and you keep refusing to take it&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe I should post your winning move
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: You mean I should have won it much earlier
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: unless you expect my bot to look 80 turns ahead
 darkhorse64: You always surpass my expectations
 MSmits: that can mean two things
 MSmits: either your expectations are very low or I do very well :P
 darkhorse64: Choose whatever suits you better
 MSmits: are you pulling down karlis o?
 MSmits: he only has 39.01 now
 MSmits: almost seems like you're benching him
 MSmits: hmm yes you won 5 out of 9 on last submit
 darkhorse64: I have a few wins. I am tweaking my exploration parameter
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-onitama/darkhorse64">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-onitama/darkhorse64</a>
 MSmits: weird stats
 MSmits: you win more vs top 2
 MSmits: this is oware all over again
 MSmits: oops i forgot to put in an exploration parameter. I guess it is 1
 darkhorse64: Indeed. I should look into the bug before continuing. If my stats are wrong, I am in trouble
 MSmits: I might have bugs too, still. I really did a number on myself with this state representation 
 Quidome: What is the most active multi at the moment?
 darkhorse64: Non deterministic bot = plague
 Quidome: Can i see that somewhere?
 MSmits: darkhorse64 agreed
 dbdr: Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics">https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics</a>
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics">https://cgmulti.azke.fr/statistics</a>
 eulerscheZahl: :rage:
 MSmits: lurker!
 darkhorse64: Judging by the chat, Tulips and Daisies
 Quidome: thnxs
 MSmits: that toad is always lurking
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 eulerscheZahl: getting frustrated with that optim game
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: at this point it's getting funny :D
 MSmits: oh the one for $0&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: you writing half a second later
 eulerscheZahl: not the first time
 dbdr: unfortunately it seems cgmulti does not get the list of multis dynamically&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: would be interesting to compare OOC with UTG
 eulerscheZahl: to see how much the fast release helped
 dbdr: indeed
 dbdr: I think the data is somewhere in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards</a>&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so, let's watch the wine poisoning you recommended yesterday
 dbdr: I mean can be computed
 eulerscheZahl: fairly simple to get these stats actually
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm not in a mood
 dbdr: ah, with date of last submit?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: just to see who submitted after the relaunch
 dbdr: I'm #5 :o
 dbdr: and ValGrowth #1
 Illedan: Power of spam!
 dbdr: whose spam?&#160;:)
 Illedan: no idea, just guessing :P
 dbdr: agenti ds are different between contest and multi even with no new code&#160;:(
 dbdr: but I think we can use the contest agent ids in the multi, right?
 Illedan: ye
 l0524: Could someone help me and tell me where I can find my completed? I need to send this to my professor, however I can't find it
 JBM: you won't find your completed unless you it first
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 l0524: unless I what first?
 JBM: your what completed?
 karliso: MSmits Results make some sense. mcts might be better than minimax, but good minimax is better at beating weaker minimaxes.
 l0524: completed puzzles form "practice" section
 MSmits: karliso sure, that's possible
 l0524: apologies, I'm new here
 JBM: they're the ones with a check mark next to them
 MSmits: darkhorse64, 1 more time :P
 JBM: you can find your stuff either in the solutions tab from a puzzle, or in the history section in the ide
 l0524: ah, thank u 
 MSmits: thanks darkhorse64&#160;:)
 MSmits: I would say this is the perfect value for your exploration parameter :P
 MSmits: aww kicked to 2 again
 darkhorse64: 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, ...
 MSmits: this sort of parameter i prefer to test with selfplay
 MSmits: doesnt seem likely there is much overtraining
 MSmits: or just test vs 1 opponent
 darkhorse64: Your solver is better than mine, you sometimes predict the issue 4 ply before me. Might be due to speed or a bug in my solver
 Floor: Would you consider searching how to do different statements / functions etc when doing a Practice challenge "Cheating"
 MSmits: darkhorse64 i dont have simulations
 MSmits: so more rollouts
 Floor: and I don't mean ripping the code from someones Github that they've posted
 JBM: no
 MSmits: Floor there are many standard algorithms, many puzzles just test if you know them
 MSmits: its fine for learning
 MSmits: google away
 Floor: Yeah I understand the algorithms in pseudo code, just didn't know if I was cheating myself by searching different ways to do them in my desired language on Google.
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: every puzzle is different, you still need to apply it to the situation
 darkhorse64: I have 3 M "short" rollouts first turn
 MSmits: especially with more complex puzzles. This will require you adapt existing algorithms
 MSmits: let me see
 eulerscheZahl: short? you limit the depth?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: to what? that's relevant for comparing numbers&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: depth 1 then eval
 MSmits: I get  up to 800k rollouts with which I evaluate about 9 million nodes max
 MSmits: but no random sim
 MSmits: so i just expand and evaluate each child
 darkhorse64: First turn or next turns
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MSmits: first
 MSmits: mmh it differs a lot per game
 MSmits: i just see a game with 600k rollouts and 10 million root visits (10 Mnodes evaluated)
 MSmits: it depends on the cards a lot
 MSmits: second turn for this game was 32k rollouts and about half a million nodes evaluated
 darkhorse64: Our figures are too different. Either you are slow or my stats are botched
 MSmits: your rollout is defined differently
 MSmits: your 3 million corresponds best to my 9 million
 MSmits: because when you expand you count each child as a rollout
 darkhorse64: True
 MSmits: i count 1 expansion as 1 rollout
 MSmits: i evaluate each child immediately after that without doing randoms
 MSmits: we had that difference in oware also
 MSmits: I've found that as your eval gets better, my way becomes better, but with worse eval, your way is
 MSmits: worse eval needs to be offset with randomness
 MSmits: thats why total randomness is so necessary in uttt, no good eval
 darkhorse64: I should also check depth 0, "worse eval needs to be offset with randomness" is an interesting conclusion that you do not find in the litterature
 MSmits: well i found this experimentally with oware
 MSmits: at first my best was depth 5
 MSmits: then depth 4
 MSmits: then 1 and when the eval got best, it became 0
 MSmits: i refitted it a lot, so i could really track how the ideal depth changed
 darkhorse64: Find the same with Onitama but i can't remember if I tested depth 0
 MSmits: I just never even tried random rollouts. It's a lot of work to code
 MSmits: also they might be a bit expensive
 darkhorse64: I did. It was way worse
 dbdr: seems intuitive to me. a perfect eval would be better than random moves
 MSmits: no i meant random rollouts to depth x, i didnt code that for onitama
 MSmits: total random would definitely be bad here
 darkhorse64: You are #1 again until my next submit
 MSmits: hehe ok
 MarcoSP: How can I send a private message to someone who is not in this chat?
 MSmits: my winrate vs karlis o is about 40% btw
 darkhorse64: Take a scrrenshot
 MSmits: I still have 4 ideas to test though
 MSmits: got constant = 0 for them, 
 MSmits: already coded. Fitting takes too long :P
 darkhorse64: 1.25 or 2.0 exploration parameter makes hardly any difference
 MSmits: hmm doesn't surprise me that much. It often has a large plateau
 MSmits: just take the center of it i'd say
 jacek: you try each child before going further?
 MSmits: what do you mean?
 darkhorse64: Currently testing
 MSmits: you mean on selection jacek? I visit each child at least once before I move deeper yes
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: actually, I count the eval as the first visit
 MSmits: so they are immediately all visited once
 MSmits: so maybe the answer is no?
 MSmits: not sure..
 MSmits: btw, you can pull me down far with a chain submit jacek
 MSmits: but thats temporary
 MSmits: versions vary wildly
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/73c06093-9dfa-4c3d-8407-c7f383f550f1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/73c06093-9dfa-4c3d-8407-c7f383f550f1</a>
 MSmits: current version is very weak to you
 MSmits: I'm getting a baseline test now so I can try what happens if I test the other ideas
 jacek: well i mean in selection phase, UCT is infinity
 MSmits: oh, on expansion, all my child nodes get evaluated, that;s their score and their visitcount is set to 1
 jacek: so if there is an unexpleored child, youll visit it first. unless you use some eval or FPU to ignore those
 MSmits: so i never encounter this situation
 jacek: oh
 MSmits: the combined evaluation gets backpropagatedf
 MSmits: except on win/loss of course, then it's just 1 or -1
 MSmits: (eval is between -1 and 1)
 jacek: how complicated is your eval :thinking:
 MSmits: current is fairly simple, but it's about to double in complexity. 
 Adnmaster: in code royale, sometimes you can be born as blue. But when i am born as blue, errors on my code occur. Anyone know how to fix that?
 MSmits: check whats different about being blue, see how your code handles that
 jacek: or maybe i should focus on speed? karliso is always 1-2 plies deeper than me
 MSmits: probably the starting coordinate
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: what enhancements did you use
 MSmits: ab pruning i assume
 MSmits: also TT?
 MSmits: for mcts, TT was no success for me
 Adnmaster: for example, i coded it to build two barracks then attack, but when im blue it only builds one than attacks
 MSmits: but minimax is different
 MSmits: karlis o hasnt done minimax before. 
 jacek: TT and some mover ordering
 MSmits: which is a bit annoying :P He also hadnt done uttt before when he got nr 1
 MSmits: done mcts before I mean
 MSmits: ah ok, seems ok jacek
 MSmits: but you will get deeper with better eval maybe
 MSmits: ab pruning works better when scores vary more i think
 MSmits: for mcts it was definitely like this. If my eval is better, my bot solves deeper
 jacek: oh and also killer moves
 MSmits: yeah thats all quite normal
 MSmits: you can also do a quick check at the end to maybe eval 1 layer deeper
 MSmits: to see if the opponent has a finishing move
 darkhorse64: killer move is a move that causes a cut in ab&#160;?
 MSmits: I think you save 1 or 2 moves at each depth
 MSmits: that caused cutoff I thought
 MSmits: you check those first
 jacek: yes. you save move (or 2) for each ply that cuased cutoff and later try it first if available
 darkhorse64: You can also use quiescence search when capturing or being captured. Thanks for definition
 karliso: Yeah, I use PVS for onitama. I have no intuition for how it works, but it seemed somewhat faster than ab pruning.
 MSmits: thats nega scout?
 MSmits: also, it is cool that you share this karliso, thanks
 jacek: pvs/negascout gave me neglibile profit
 karliso: Yes, I don't know how it works, but it does work.
 jacek: this is typical for recursive few-liners
 MSmits: jacek did you somehow take into account the fact that this game has a lot of very short branches with a quick win? I have no idea how this would factor into your minimax, but it might make things different
 MSmits: other games dont have this as much
 MSmits: it's comparable to yavalath in this regard, but with a lot less brancing
 jacek: iterative deepening should take care of that
 MSmits: I wonder how expensive iterative deepening gets when you have almost no branching
 jacek: still worth it
 MSmits: yeah I guess it is
 MSmits: also, depth might have a +1 or -1 in the definition
 MSmits: you might define it to be smaller
 MSmits: not by more than 1, but still
 MSmits: you could call your first move the depth 0 move and say your depth is 0 or you could say you've done 1 move and your depth is now 1
 MSmits: anyways, thats the sum of my knowledge on minimax. You do exactly the same thing as what I do when I try minimax and it's always worse than my mcts&#160;:(
 jacek: coclustion - your mcts is just very good
 MSmits: it's good, but it's also different every time. I practiced it a lot
 MSmits: I should practice minimax more, but I lack motivation
 MSmits: maybe if someone explained to me a proper eval for tron :0
 darkhorse64: Maybe for the next challenge, if it's really a pacman variation&#160;?
 MSmits: you need to practice it too dont you?
 MSmits: you're always doing mcts
 darkhorse64: I have google mcts pacman and it returned something
 MSmits: "Did you mean mrs. pacman?"
 darkhorse64: I am quite in the same situation: heavy mcts practitioner
 darkhorse64: "mcts  pacman"
 MSmits: hehe nvm, mrs pacman is a game
 darkhorse64: Heard of it
 MSmits: I suspect the game will be very different from pacman. Will just have some kind of grid with walls and such, but other than that, no similarities
 MSmits: I think it's mostly a theme
 MSmits: anyway, off to the store, need to get some food and :rage: at people for getting near me
 darkhorse64: Take care 
 jacek: you mean those getting closer score to you?
 MSmits: no, there's this thing called corona :P
 MSmits: and some people are idiots
 darkhorse64: Also but we do not fear retaliation
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Except getting even more rekt

 Uljahn: ye, use autocomplete, ctrl+space
 dbdr: coc -- what a strange gamethe only winning move is not to play
 AntiSquid: do something other than clash Im_A_Rookie
 Astrobytes: And get an anime avatar
 Im_A_Rookie: Okay
 Im_A_Rookie: to be honest i hate this ide you have to write all the code on your own normally it does it automatically
 Im_A_Rookie: ctrl + space 
 Im_A_Rookie: nice
 AntiSquid: you could try to use CG sync
 WINWINWIN: In code vs Zombies, what if a zombie is equidistant from 2 humans?
 Nerchio: legend run in ghost in the cell? lets goo
 EricSMSO: WINWINWIN It will probably go towards the human with the lowest ID
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN how is ur CSB bot
 cegprakash: legend yet?
 AntiSquid: he is playing code vs zombies, why does CSB matter?
 Nerchio: Promotion to Legend League in&#160;:01H 06MN 52SC
 Astrobytes: grats Nerchio
 Nerchio: my last submit ended ~65, i didnt change anything #1
 Nerchio: it was similar in ooc gold
 Nerchio: i need to learn how to deal with this randomness ;p
 darkhorse64: Did you follow any PM or is it just your own algo&#160;?
 jacek: damm teapot stop spam submitting,i keep getting worse&#160;:\
 Nerchio: my own algo or rather heuristic not much of an algo xD
 darkhorse64: #3 is not enough. I want to rule the world
 darkhorse64: Just gone from 34 to 37 by tweaking parameters
 Nerchio: where you are #rd?
 darkhorse64: Onitama
 Nerchio: ah that one is too hard for me
 hozayfeh: HI:raised_hand:
 Nerchio: D:
 MaciejF: Hi everyone! Could someone explain me one thing about mtcs?
 AntiSquid: maybe
 darkhorse64: go ahead
 MSmits: thats how it starts
 MSmits: 1 thing
 AntiSquid: maybe that's all he wanted to know
 Nerchio: MSmits is a teacher he can help im sure
 Nerchio: :D
 AntiSquid: if someone can explain stuff to him about mcts
 MSmits: ohh
 MaciejF: it really is one thing xDIs node's value just wins / number_of_visits&#160;?
 MaciejF: what about loses?
 MSmits: count a loss as -1
 MSmits: and a win as +1
 AntiSquid: Nerchio doubt it, he is supposed to teach physics, but plays bot programming instead&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: all students fail
 MSmits: :P
 Nerchio: xD
 Astrobytes: :joy:
 Adnmaster: :joy:
 darkhorse64: He teaches mcts to CG members
 MSmits: sometimes&#160;:)
 MaciejF: MSmits what if I told you that in UTTT my bot jumped about ~20 places when i switched from (wins - losses) / visits to just wins/visits
 darkhorse64: You fixed a bug
 MSmits: I'd say you are in silver or gold where everything is quite random
 MSmits: and 20 places is basically the same rank
 MaciejF: actually, yesterday I got into legend
 darkhorse64: oops
 MSmits: you jumped 20 places in legend?
 MaciejF: yeah
 Nerchio: take that msmits hahah!
 MSmits: lol
 MaciejF: And I just tried another evaluation that seems to give better results
 MSmits: interesting, you just ignore losses?
 MSmits: wait a minute
 MSmits: you increase visit count when you ignore the win?
 MaciejF: Yeah, but I didnt like it
 MaciejF: yeah, I do that
 MSmits: so you count a loss as a draw
 MaciejF: exactly 
 MSmits: I am thinking you just lowered your margin
 MSmits: the min-max score
 MSmits: which means you could have just doubled your exploration parameter for the same effect
 MSmits: draws rarely happen so
 MSmits: your loss score is now 0
 MSmits: and your win score is 1
 MSmits: instead of -1 and 1
 MaciejF: I think you are right. I have just tried another evaluation that incorporates losses and it gave me another boost:(wins * (1 - losses/visits)) / visits
 MaciejF: it's like weighting wins by losses
 MaciejF: can't go negative so exploration part still has some effect
 MSmits: i think you are overcomplicating things
 MSmits: it doesnt matter if it goes negative
 MSmits: if your loss score is -500 and your winscore is -498, you have the same bot as when your loss score is -1 and your win score is 1
 MSmits: the difference is what matters
 MSmits: the difference compared to the exploration parameter
 MSmits: you are comparing different nodes to select one
 MSmits: so if all nodes have a 499 lower score, the result of the selection formula will be the same. you select the same child
 jacek: wait, how draws in uttt are rare? o.O
 MSmits: rare as in 10% or so
 MSmits: I am trying to explain why he got an improvement by ignoring losses
 jacek: i already 'ignore' losses, as i have 0, 0.5 and 1.0&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol... thats not ignoring losses either
 jacek: nyoro~n
 MSmits: you can change that to -1, 0 and 1 and double the exploration parameter and you have the exact same bot
 MSmits: only it's prettier&#160;:)
 MSmits: cuz no broken results (0.5)
 MSmits: can use integers
 MaciejF: MSsmits so are you saying that I've just indirectly increased exploration parameter?
 MSmits: did you just use another anime thingy jacek
 MSmits: yes MaciejF
 jacek: :eyes:
 MSmits: the score range is half as small
 MSmits: so exploration is relatively twice as strong
 MSmits: you just needed more exploration is why your bot improved
 Uljahn: i agree on exploration constant being the cause if it's vanilla mcts (no heavy rollouts or something)
 MaciejF: Ok I think I understand :D Thank you! It's nice to get some explanation from 1st UTTT player!
 MSmits: np&#160;:)
 MSmits: afk 10-15 mins, drop me a pm if you have more questions
 jacek: 1st UTTT? oh my
 jacek: reCurse not gonna be happy
 MSmits: he knows
 MSmits: he's is 3rd
 darkhorse64: UTTT is like Games Of Thrones. Heads roll
 MSmits: and dont ping him jacek, you meanie
 MSmits: brb
 dbdr: I'm sure he's happy to be reminded he's not #1 anymore
 Nerchio: lol
 Illedan: Send him a PM just to be sure..
 jacek: maybe i should invite to clash to cheer him up
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: make a bot that automatically invites him jacek
 AntiSquid: best birthday gift ever
 AntiSquid: detective pika #3 isn't really a mobius strip is it? statement doesn't make any sense when compared to what i see in the replay
 AntiSquid: and why does the replay not always work wtf?
 BenjaminUrquhart: pika is a mess
 BenjaminUrquhart: chang emy mind
 AntiSquid: no, i agree
 BenjaminUrquhart: and yes, it's not a mobius strip
 AntiSquid: guess i need to read forums to figure shit out?
 BenjaminUrquhart: literally ignore the statement and you'll be fine :eyes:
 AntiSquid: done that in ooc :thinking:
 AntiSquid: was reading chat instead of statement
 MSmits: pika is a good puzzle except for the moebius. You can solve it by looking at the examples though, with some trial and error
 MSmits: took me about an hour i think, the moebius one
 MSmits: the cube thingy also an hour
 AntiSquid: if it says moebius strip then that's what i expect, want and should get, otherwise it's a shit puzzle
 MSmits: if it was just that, then yes. But it is 4 puzzles
 AntiSquid: talking about #3, that's one puzzle
 MSmits: the other 3 are fine
 MSmits: ah ok, then i agree
 AntiSquid: i just don't like puzzles where the statement is part of the problem
 MSmits: same
 AntiSquid: happens an awful lot on other sites
 AntiSquid: difficult explanation or inaccurate details to misguide you
 MSmits: we can edit statements thankfully
 AntiSquid: would have to reupload contrib then
 MSmits: really? I edited a puzzle once, dont think it reuploaded
 AntiSquid: which i don't have lol, can't edit statement separately
 MSmits: I edited this one: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/pirates-treasure">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/pirates-treasure</a>
 AntiSquid: i think it's because of the viewer?
 MSmits: oh, that might be true yeah
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, SDK contributions require a full upload
 AntiSquid: ya it's different, you can edit statement separately with that one
 eulerscheZahl: btw MSmits: langton's ant
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: i never got a response on my message
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: let's vandalize
 MSmits: let me find the message, so i know what the error was
 MSmits: err where do i see messages i sent?

 eulerscheZahl: while checking my forum profile i just realized that the OOC postmortem is my most upvoted one
 AntiSquid: time for a ninja fix!
 eulerscheZahl: share images instead of meaningful insights i guess :P
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised, the replay is still up
 MSmits: the statistics were great
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: ya i upvoted for cool image
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl do you think you can fix the ant thing? I am afraid to touch it
 eulerscheZahl: ok, will do
 MSmits: I am sure the bug is there though
 eulerscheZahl: first create an own contrib for testing
 MSmits: ah right
 AntiSquid: only upvoted actual PMs instead of just random statements and opinions, and only PM i've actually read
 AntiSquid: MSmits gonna wreck the contrib&#160;?
 MSmits: thats what i was afraid of yes :P
 MSmits: the fact that it is someone else's work makes it worse
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: it might resubmit the bosses when i upload it
 MSmits: does that mean everyone gets promoted?
 eulerscheZahl: possibly
 eulerscheZahl: at least some

 MSmits: maybe we should check with a cg dev first?
 eulerscheZahl: preview. right now it's my own contrib for testing
 AntiSquid: just yolo submit
 MSmits: ok, will submit my bot in the highest league
 MSmits: *after* i switch to c++ mode :P
 MSmits: o right
 MSmits: I am alone :P
 Illedan: There is a bug in Langtons ant?
 MSmits: yes
 Illedan: which?
 MSmits: when your ant goes off screen in the first game a boolean is set to true and is not set back to false for the second game
 jacek: well ants are bugs anyway so whats the problem
 eulerscheZahl: ok, the ant is moving again after it left the grid
 MSmits: or false and not set back to true
 eulerscheZahl: code:

 MSmits: ok
 AntiSquid: of course there's a bug in langton's ant, the title would be misleading otherwise
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: the apostrophe in the title alone is a bug already
 AntiSquid: nvm, chat scroll
 MSmits: sigh
 MSmits: now i put the python bot in my onitama ide
 eulerscheZahl: hope you submitted instead of playing too :D
 MSmits: hehe no :P
 MSmits: yep it moves twice
 MSmits: good job
 eulerscheZahl: so, shall we risk it?
 Illedan: Did trictrac tell his approach in Tulips?
 Illedan: still ifs?
 MSmits: well what is the alternative eulerscheZahl?
 MSmits: if it resubmits the bosses, will there ever be anything we can do about that?
 eulerscheZahl: let it broken? :D
 eulerscheZahl: ok, let's do it :fingers_crossed:
 MSmits: allright&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the zip is even smaller than before, i have a better zip compression
 MSmits: and that with a whole extra line of code
 MSmits: Illedan don't know, but trictrac almost always does a minimax, if he can
 AntiSquid: is redstrike winning the bug? :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: euler you said "let it broken"and so it became
 MSmits: AntiSquid he does abuse the bug sometimes, but his bot is better even without the bug
 eulerscheZahl: what's that?
 BenjaminUrquhart: CodinBotRelay logs
 Illedan: Minmax is hard on the tulips though
 BenjaminUrquhart: trying to fix some stuff that broke from CG updates
 Astrobytes: If that's still ifs Illedan I'm seriously impressed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/s6aqrv">https://prnt.sc/s6aqrv</a>
 jacek: Oups?
 Astrobytes: What are you using Illedan?
 eulerscheZahl: so i can't edit someone else's contribution after all?
 MSmits: I guess so
 Illedan: Which is nice :P
 MSmits: Should I write a tech support ticket or something?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: ok will do
 eulerscheZahl: ping thibaud on the forum, giving the line
 MSmits: if you mention him in the message he gets pinged?
 eulerscheZahl:     private void reinit(){ // Réinitialse tout à la fin du premier round
 eulerscheZahl: @_CG_Thibaud
 eulerscheZahl: sends an email to him
 eulerscheZahl: the last line of the 3 above is what i added
 MSmits: ah yes, resetting the touche_bord
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid tric trac had no search previously in TaD
 MSmits: where do i do this @_CG_Thibaud
 dbdr: touché
 AntiSquid: ya but do you call ooc bot with tracker only just if-else bot?
 Astrobytes: It's just "touche" in the code
 Astrobytes: We're talking about TaD tho
 eulerscheZahl: in the forum MSmits
 Astrobytes: @AntiSquid
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: just start typing, autocomplete will help
 AntiSquid: i am saying he might have a lot more than simple ifs to Astrobytes
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid but he confirmed previously that he did not, we're speculating on what he has now
 Astrobytes: I get what you mean
 Astrobytes: dbdr how deep is your TaD minimax?
 dbdr: 3, without checking the time :D
 dbdr: about 20% timeouts
 Astrobytes: Cool. I'm at 2, with a somewhat inefficient bot
 Astrobytes: Rewrite tomorrow I guess
 Astrobytes: eval just score? 
 dbdr: yeah
 Astrobytes: Same. Trying to come up with some other ideas
 wlesavo: TaD is cool name btw
 AntiSquid: TD
 AntiSquid: :D
 eulerscheZahl: TD is taken
 AntiSquid: 2x CR, 2x TD
 eulerscheZahl: 2.5x CotR
 dbdr: 2x CotR
 dbdr: .5?
 AntiSquid: good
 Astrobytes: Code of the Rings
 eulerscheZahl: coders of the realm 1+2
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl! you were faster!!!!
 eulerscheZahl: haha
 dbdr: ah
 AntiSquid: refer to checkers as C
 struct: Y
 AntiSquid: it's the acronym
 AntiSquid: didn't see anyone say OA yet
 trictrac: illedan, now i am with min max on TaD
 MSmits: ha!
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: See, told ya's
 BenjaminUrquhart: what's TaD?
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh
 jacek: turd
 Astrobytes: Tulips and Daisies
 BenjaminUrquhart: that flower one
 Astrobytes: good work trictrac
 BenjaminUrquhart: "Back in the 1980s, children in school had math notebooks in which the pages were printed by a grid of squares."
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 MSmits: me too
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've got grid notebooks
 trictrac: thanks but EricSMSO is better for the instant
 MSmits: jacek, this is funny
 dbdr: unacceptable&#160;:)
 MSmits: i thought you would for sure pull me down with your chain submit
 MSmits: and you did
 MSmits: but you pulled karliso more :P
 AntiSquid: are the costs varying from game to game for TaD&#160;?
 MSmits: maybe with more spam you could be nr 21
 MSmits: 1
 Astrobytes: No AntiSquid
 jacek: and you can play certain game with this notebook <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/93aazuyvdow21.png">https://i.redd.it/93aazuyvdow21.png</a>
 AntiSquid: we get them as input though :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, annoying
 MSmits: I love that notebook!
 Astrobytes: yay organic chemistry
 MSmits: it's a yavalath book!
 AntiSquid: nice :D
 AntiSquid: so what do you do when you don't draw carbon bonds? :p
 Astrobytes: I drew all mine freehand, I wish I'd had a notebook like that
 Nerchio: is tulips a good challenge to write my first monte carlo?
 MSmits: what do you mean a monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: huge branching
 MSmits: some people confuse monte carlo and monte carlo tree search
 Nerchio: i meant mcts
 AntiSquid: but what's wrong with free hand?
 MSmits: do uttt for that
 eulerscheZahl: smash the code is good for monte carlo
 Astrobytes: Yeah they should have called it Oak Trees and Pine Trees
 AntiSquid: wasn't there some rotation in chemistry that's very important to not mess up when drawing&#160;?
 MSmits: tulips will not work well  with mcts if you've never done it before
 Nerchio: i dont like tick tac toe not really into uttt :s
 MSmits: hmm ok, then do bandas
 Astrobytes: Are you talking about chirality AntiSquid?
 eulerscheZahl: bandas is a good choice
 eulerscheZahl: or connect4
 MSmits: yeah but he wants an arena that gives cp
 Nerchio: bandas looks more fun i guess
 MSmits: and xp
 eulerscheZahl: both have a limited branching so you get visible results with less rollouts already
 MSmits: bandas is cool
 AntiSquid: ya that one
 MSmits: the pushing sim will be a bit complicated at first
 MSmits: oware has similar complexity
 MSmits: can do that too
 AntiSquid: is chat being weird? i get like +5 lines pop up at a time
 eulerscheZahl: also a good candidate for bitboards
 eulerscheZahl: first the MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: then the bitboards
 eulerscheZahl: don't start 2 wars at once
 MSmits: *now* you tell me :P
 eulerscheZahl: i always did
 MSmits: well yes, but not when i wrote my first mcts that already had bitboard :P
 MSmits: took me a whole month
 MSmits: actually
 MSmits: maybe you told me
 MSmits: I am stubborn
 Astrobytes: Didn't you learn C++ during that time too tho
 MSmits: yeah but i had bitboard and mcts in c# already
 Astrobytes: *begin to learn*
 AntiSquid: wait you can do mcts for csb no?
 MSmits: yeah I guess you can
 MSmits: but i think its hard
 MSmits: people do minimax with it
 struct: What did you use on Langton?
 MSmits: mcts
 AndrewLaneX: I got captcha'd
 AndrewLaneX:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: nerchio if CP is your main goal:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/?user=ca7666783c8b1849544468008f6b2d3e1597351">http://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/?user=ca7666783c8b1849544468008f6b2d3e1597351</a>
 struct: if CP go CSB, probably one of the easiest legend
 MSmits: I saw you type something about FB as well
 MSmits: 137 lines?
 AntiSquid: 137 lines what?
 MSmits: for a bot in FB to get legend
 struct: legend 131 lines javascript
 AntiSquid: BS @_@
 struct: I had to spam submit gold
 struct: But I got legend
 AntiSquid: i guess you write it all in one like lol
 MSmits: probably some strong heuristics and no spells
 AntiSquid: how do you keep track of the game and what spells to cast lol
 struct: I have spells
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: do you search?
 struct: Just heuristics
 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: "strong" heuristics, more like code golfed heuristics i bet 
 MSmits: well they have to be strong too
 AntiSquid: if spaghetti can get legend yes, not arguing that, it's just the code size
 MSmits: struct is pretty talented
 Astrobytes: Especially at deleting accounts and finishing Yinsh :P
 MSmits: he has many
 AntiSquid: this isn't that struct&#160;? this is Tobou or are they related?
 Astrobytes: Many Yinshes?
 MSmits: talents
 Astrobytes: Same person squiddy
 MSmits: they're all the same talented weirdo
 AntiSquid: was struct made when tobou was still around as a username?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 AntiSquid: maybe they were even both in chat at some point ...
 AntiSquid: 1 alter ego too many
 Astrobytes: He changed Tobou to struct, the proof.txt is on the MultiStruct github thanks to euler :D
 MSmits: how long did he carry this secret?
 Astrobytes: A year? Ish?
 AntiSquid: i know the name changed to struct, but he had a second account then, which is weird considering how active he was on it
 Astrobytes: He had more accounts too, Nulte was one, and there were others
 AntiSquid: and he acted as a separate individual on it
 AntiSquid: idk about nulte, just saw struct in chat A LOT!
 Astrobytes: I busted his Nulte account in chat
 AntiSquid: it's like Mr ROBOT lol
 AntiSquid: (horrible show btw)
 struct: I typed on phrase here and then deleted
 struct: Or something like that
 AntiSquid: struct it's ok
 AntiSquid: create as many alts as you wish but please put some avatars on them, it's getting annoying
 MSmits: this one has an avatar
 AntiSquid: this is the main
 Astrobytes: So did the Nulte one
 eulerscheZahl: when struct was new (around the time when langton's ant came out), he even said that he is an alt. but that he's rarely chatting with the main account and we won't know him anyways
 MSmits: or is it?
 Astrobytes: Correct eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: I remember that
 MSmits: we all started guessing then
 AntiSquid: ah, that time when we guess struct was the main and MSmits was his alt&#160;?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: MStructs
 struct: Whos the real struct
 Astrobytes: There is no struct
 JBM: will the real struct please stand up
 Astrobytes: Please stand up
 struct_s_main: hello
 struct: hi
 Nikhil_The_Lord: yo
 struct: Are these structs?
 Astrobytes: Infinistructs
 struct_s_main: automaton2000 hi
 Automaton2000: i go for the big board
 Astrobytes: All your structs are belong to us.
 struct_s_main: how to delete my alt&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Insanity.
 struct: settings 
 struct: delete account
 struct: The account is not deleted though
 trictrac: hi struct, do you resubmit yinsh or never&#160;?
 struct: tritrac I will try to finish it, but I changed a few things
 struct: For example no more multiple turns per player
 struct: and notation also changed
 trictrac: ok thank you good news
 Astrobytes: Notatiion changed to what?
 Astrobytes: *Notation
 struct: So now if you have multiple moves you must apply them all on same turn
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.gipf.com/yinsh/notations/notation.html">http://www.gipf.com/yinsh/notations/notation.html</a>
 struct: To these notation
 struct: this*
 Astrobytes: I thought you did that already
 struct: yes
 struct: But I never submited that version to CGT
 struct: CG
 Astrobytes: Ahhh ok
 Astrobytes: Multiple moves per turn sounds much better than the multiple turns in a row
 MSmits: yeah
 structs_s_main: hi
 MSmits: AntiSquid go back on your main, we dont believe you
 <b>**MSmits smells the squid in the struct</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: MSmits sniffs squids

 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: WE have problems calling you Anti

 Astrobytes: loads of them round my way
 AntiSquid: and bad at it too 
 Astrobytes: They bring shame upon their bikes
 MSmits: I'll try to remember that you have nothing against sea creatures then AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: no, i just play along with the joke
 MSmits: o
 AntiSquid: guess it would have been lame to just pick a "anti" + sea_creature_name

 Astrobytes: Intriguing...
 Adnmaster: is there any way to find out if we're red or blue in the beginning of the game? (code royale)
 AntiSquid: something to do with id of player? see statement
 Astrobytes: Umm, position I think? Just off the top of my head
 Astrobytes: Been a while, thankfully
 Adnmaster: statement?
 AntiSquid: the problem statement
 Adnmaster: we dont have statement as i know
 Astrobytes: The description of the game
 AntiSquid: the description of ... yes that
 Adnmaster: it doesnt say anything about it in the description
 AntiSquid: well you have your queen's position 
 Adnmaster: it doesnt give that as input
 AntiSquid: there was something ...
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: sorry
 Adnmaster: it does

 Adnmaster: thank you
 Astrobytes: If the statement is too confusing there are simpler multiplayers
 AntiSquid: ya, play ocean of code instead 
 Adnmaster: i think ocean of code is harder than this
 AntiSquid: was a joke :D
 Adnmaster: :D

 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: Hello everyone, I would like to make a question about Mars Lander. How do i detect where the ground is flat?
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: please
 struct: There will be two coordinates given where the y is the same
 struct: Maybe there are more
 struct: but pick the one with the longest distance of X
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: I'm trying to find thos land coordinates but still not see it. Thanks anyway&#160;;)
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: will check the args[] but i dont think so
 struct: its above
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: inside the for loop?
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: landX, landY&#160;?
 struct: yyes
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: because they are declared in the loop, i cannot access them, should i remove the declaration outside the loop, or there is another way to have these values?
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: to outside*
 struct: you can declare the vars outside the loop
 NatanaelXUFREGARCEZ: ok, i thought i should not touch other parts of the default code. Thanks
 AntiSquid: you can do whatever you want with the default code actually
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: like
 Nerchio: MSG MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
 AntiSquid: it's Thor puzzle Nerchio, it doesn't have an opponent or msg output
 Nerchio: damn missed opportunity
 Astrobytes: If you click on submit too many times in that puzzle you get a Thro finger
 Astrobytes: *THOR

 Astrobytes: Got it now thanks.Yeah you called draw very late, is there a mistake earlier or 
 Astrobytes: Yeah as you say, maybe very similar search
 MSmits: hmm it may just be the fact that there's many moves and no way to guide
 MSmits: if everything leads to a draw, how would you be guided anywhere?

 MSmits: made me sad

 MSmits: I'm just messing. I barely understand this game

 AntiSquid: dbdr i don't get it why didn't you do 4 in a row lol
 MSmits: I think he tried to make a bigger combo
 stacked:&#160;::sunglasses:

 MSmits: nice

 Astrobytes: Did you pass your security course OK btw MSmits
 Astrobytes: Guessing you did since you're on the AI  one now
 MSmits: yeah very near maximum score, but there was supposed to be an oral exam... haven't heard back about that. Maybe they're waiting for the corona thing
 Astrobytes: Cool. Yeah I'd imagine it's got something to do with that
 MSmits: I'm glad it is done though, I didn't like the subject much

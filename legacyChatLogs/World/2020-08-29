 Zenoscave: Is there a link?

 eulerscheZahl: chat you are laggy
 Zenoscave: Thanks!
 Hosderm: do any guys have nice git resources
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Zenoscave: Meow
 jrke: oh i forgot its caturday&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday
 Pythorn_god: va`o
 markyy: why does chats from previous clash of codes stay
 Allis: Hard to tell whether it's a bug or feature.
 jrke: its like a channel which is different for each clash so you have to delete manually
 Allis: I think the hard part is that some would want it to auto-close once they're done with the clash and others would want it to stay so they could converse with the people still clashing.
 Allis: Easy enough to make that configurable, though.
 uvBoss: @eulerscheZahl u on?I had a question on the A* 11- puzzle
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/11-puzzle">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/11-puzzle</a>
 uvBoss: or anyone else who think they can help&#160;?
 uvBoss: no one?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm back, just ask your question
 uvBoss: what heuristics did u use for this puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: so, my heuristic for the 11-puzzle: try to put the right-most column in place first
 uvBoss: im using basic manhattan distance
 eulerscheZahl: i run a BFS, not even A*
 uvBoss: oh oke
 eulerscheZahl: when i find a way to get the right column in place, i'll "freeze" it and only touch the missing region after
 uvBoss: thats it?
 uvBoss: why is that good??
 eulerscheZahl: it's not good. just sufficient to solve the problem
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even pass all visible testcases. but all validators :D
 uvBoss: okay
 uvBoss: oh damn
 jrke: thats weird euler :thinking:
 uvBoss: xD how do u come up with these solutions tho?
 eulerscheZahl: just realized that a full search was taking too long. so i added this to make it faster. now that one testcase gets solved but takes more than 50 moves
 eulerscheZahl: the "free" tile is at the top right, so the left part isn't affected by it
 eulerscheZahl: let's solve this first and have the same problem again at a smaller scale
 uvBoss: so u are trying to get less than 50 moves solution instead of the optimal one?
 uvBoss: alright thanks man
 eulerscheZahl: yes. whatever meets both move count and SPU time constraints
 eulerscheZahl: CPU*
 eulerscheZahl: and the failing testcase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484200270">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484200270</a>
 eulerscheZahl: just 1 move short :D
 uvBoss: yea....so u are solving from the right to left
 uvBoss: what testcase is that?
 eulerscheZahl: 7th
 uvBoss: i fail 7 and 8 too
 eulerscheZahl: on submit there are only 6 testcases
 eulerscheZahl: submit and see if you get lucky
 uvBoss: i fail the 5th and 6th
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 uvBoss: in validators
 uvBoss: plain timeout
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 uvBoss: coz i dont move until i solve the puzzle
 uvBoss: or to put it in another way until i readch the solution
 eulerscheZahl: same: i find a complete solution before printing a single action
 uvBoss: maybe i should not always go for the optimal solution then
 uvBoss: ok thanks man let me see
 uvBoss: did u use c++&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: C#
 eulerscheZahl: maxime (who uploaded the game) has an A* solution in python
 eulerscheZahl: he mentioned that it takes about 200ms worst case
 uvBoss: oh damn
 Marchete: happy caturday
 SpotlessCoder: Hi I'm streaming clash of code on twitch @ twitch.tv/spotlesscoder - Please visit my channel!&#160;:) - Best of luck!
 BlackWraith: Is there a way to view completed puzzles by language?  I want to revisit puzzles multiple times for c#, c++, etc.
 eulerscheZahl: there is no way
 eulerscheZahl: not even a spoon
 JBM: there used to
 JBM: Orabig's toolpage
 JBM: where did that go
 JBM: that would be it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Orabig/CGPuzzleStats">https://github.com/Orabig/CGPuzzleStats</a>
 JBM: but it doesn't appear to be online anymore
 WhiteGlove: Can anyone review my piece of code for the Bulk Email Generator?
 JBM: isn't that what the tests are for?
 WhiteGlove: yeah, but only I pass 2 of them
 WhiteGlove: and i believe that I'm on the right track to solve it
 JBM: remember the input isn't especially line-oriented
 JBM: read all of it; process all of it
 WhiteGlove: hold up
 WhiteGlove: you are the author xD
 JBM: yup
 WhiteGlove: my respects, brother
 JBM: lol
 JBM: you'll have plenty of time to respect me *if* you solve it :p
 WhiteGlove: I'm digging into the javadocs for more info ona method
 WhiteGlove: but so far it does what I expected, not the solution

 Marchete: for anyone interested
 Marchete: I think it gives a lot of info about Dot and Boxes in a clear way, not just pure formulas
 AntiSquid: link in its forum thread&#160;? this kind of stuff always gets lost
 jrke: yeah,Marchete it will be good if you post it in forum of D&amp;B.
 Morthyr: i
 AmoSimo: hey is there any way to reset my CSB progress&#160;?
 AmoSimo: i didn't play in like 2 years and my python script has been reset for some reason&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there's a history on the left in case you submitted the code and didn't only play in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: left: resultsthen there's a history section
 AmoSimo: oh yeah found it thanks you&#160;!
 AmoSimo: oh wait ur the frog guy&#160;! glad you're still playing ^^
 eulerscheZahl: wow, you remember me&#160;:)
 Mirak42: Anyone has the c# code assist working?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. in my offline IDE
 Mirak42: ok, i think the online one is dead.
 TomaszK: yes, I just had the same issue
 WhiteGlove: Does anyone know about some website where you compare RegEx?
 WhiteGlove: this one doesn't count -&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://regexr.com/">https://regexr.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: "compare"?
 WhiteGlove: I just used the Chrome console for that
 eulerscheZahl: i usually use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>but i don't know what you mean by "compare"
 WhiteGlove: It's that I do not know why mine fails, when on said website works&#160;:(
 WhiteGlove: by compare I meant something as this:
 WhiteGlove: Open the chrome console and type String(regex1)==String(regex2)
 WhiteGlove: mine says false so... it is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: that's too vague for me, i'm out
 WhiteGlove: anyways... I solved the puzzle with a bit of help with regex

 MadKnight: yea
 MadKnight: i came up with my own sMadmiMax
 JBM: tell us all about it
 MadKnight: it's got 2 major improvements over smitsi
 MadKnight: for simul games
 Zenoscave: Hey MK how's your bot
 MadKnight: very nice
 Zenoscave: what are the improvements?
 DavidMcCabe: LMAO
 Zenoscave: what has you laughing DavidMcCabe?
 DavidMcCabe: My bad fella, thought you were calling someone in the chat a bot and I thought that was a funny way of doing it
 Zenoscave: lol, It's a common phrase in CG
 Zenoscave: how's your bot DavidMcCabe
 DavidMcCabe: Gotcha, might be able to tell I'm a noob... lol
 Zenoscave: The rank/lvl says that for sure&#160;;) but no worries. we all were a noob at one point
 DavidMcCabe: Started an hour ago, already blasted by the third problem
 DavidMcCabe: game*
 Zenoscave: Practice problem or Multi?

 DavidMcCabe: Thanks!
 2berkir: Gosh.. I hate that it kicks me out of clash when time is up. Just let me finish my work, can't even copy because of that thing.
 2berkir: I don't want any points, you can have them all. Just let me..
 BenjaminUrquhart: share your solution after it ends and copy from there
 BenjaminUrquhart: better than nothing
 DavidMcCabe: I would love to see someone's code who knew what they are doing
 DavidMcCabe: in CSB
 Zenoscave: people tend not to share code for multiplayers but any advice or tips you can imagine can be found on the forum
 reCurse: At your league this should do: target = nextCP - 3 * velocity
 Zenoscave: ^ this is true
 Legoracer: why not share in mp?
 Legoracer: sounds like missed flex
 Zenoscave: They are still actively competitive in upper leagues
 Zenoscave: but yeah some people like to share strats

 LinhT.Nguyen: nah just clashes
 LinhT.Nguyen: puzzles are hard
 LinhT.Nguyen: i only do them so often
 MadKnight: but the clashes are like mini-puzzles
 MadKnight: also haven't u tried PvP bot programming&#160;?
 LinhT.Nguyen: not yet what is it
 LinhT.Nguyen: u got the link or something
 LinhT.Nguyen: clashes are much easier than medium puzzles imo
 LinhT.Nguyen: so it keeps my dopamine receptors satisfied

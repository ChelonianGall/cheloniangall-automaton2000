 cegprakash: Going to start search race stream!  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://twitch.tv/cegprakash</a>
 cegprakash: in search race
 WINWINWIN: Well done neumann can you get 1st in CSB as well with this?
 eulerscheZahl: no :D
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: CSB is much more complex. you have an opponent blocking you
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday jacek
 WINWINWIN: Caturday?
 struct: Hello
 eulerscheZahl: yes, Caturday. We celebrate it once a week
 struct: Is site extremely slow or is it me?
 WINWINWIN: Not Saturday?
 WINWINWIN: Site is not slow struct
 cegprakash: hola hola my sim is working!
 cegprakash: join my twitch channel
 eulerscheZahl: no
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://twitch.tv/cegprakash</a>
 WINWINWIN: Optimized?
 cegprakash: 3 tests fail on my search race
 cegprakash: how do I debug those
 jrke: its random sometimes fails 
 jrke: as random moves maybe have no optimal moves
 cegprakash: does it mean we haven't completed 3 loops in 600 turns?
 jrke: yes
 jrke: we haven't completed it in 600 turns
 cegprakash: do I have to pass all cases to get into the leaderboard?
 jrke: as you r choosing random moves and sometimes it don't have optimal moves
 jrke: no your best submit will be chosen for leaderboard
 jrke: watch this

 struct: Why do you post this sh*t here?
 ShlOk: hey ijust want to know the working . i dont want to harm any one.
 struct: google the code
 struct: you will get the answer
 ShlOk: i got this from a website telling this code can swithch off the internet permanently.  Is it so?
 ShlOk: There are many professionals out here who can help me 
 ShlOk: pls help!!
 ShlOk: :nerd:
 WINWINWIN: ShlOk those are some nonsense viruses through notepad
 WINWINWIN: you have to type it in and save it as .bat
 ShlOk: But can it really harm anyone?
 WINWINWIN: No
 ShlOk: and if yes how to resolve it?
 WINWINWIN: only the computer you use it on
 WINWINWIN: probably have to reset to fix it
 ShlOk: Will the data be secure&#160;?
 ShlOk: or data will be formatted?
 WINWINWIN: No idea
 ShlOk: ok
 ShlOk: tHNKS BHAI.
 DaNinja: it just releases your IP address temporarily
 WINWINWIN: just seen this kind of stufff before on the computers in my scool
 WINWINWIN: np ShlOk
 ShlOk: @Daninja resetting ur computer will delete ur files&#160;?
 DaNinja: no
 ShlOk: @DaNinja That means this sorts of codes are just pranks. LOL
 WINWINWIN: Exactly
 DaNinja: yep pranks
 ShlOk: HAHAHA
 ShlOk: @ DaNinja and @WINWINWIN Thank both of u for helping me or i would have run it on my pc:joy:
 WINWINWIN: np :D
 ShlOk: :sweat_smile:
 hem123: anyone an idea how i can log
 hem123: using python
 struct: printing to stderr?
 hem123: yes but how can i put lets say some variable in stderr?
 struct: ofc, similar to stdout
 WINWINWIN: print(output, file = sys.stderr)
 WINWINWIN: add import sys at the top of your code
 cegprakash: I've a doubt in paper soccer
 cegprakash: "Player will provide output in the form of string of digits. For example, 2 will move the ball to the right. String 4644 will move ball down, then left, then down and down."
 jacek: because they bounce
 jacek: from drawn lines
 cegprakash: don't get you
 cegprakash: can I kick the ball infinite length?
 jacek: no
 cegprakash: how long can I kick
 jacek: you can kick multiple times until ball lands on empty intersection
 cegprakash: empty intersection?
 jacek: the pictures in the statement should be clear
 jacek: empty as in without any drawn lines yet
 jrke: cegprakash i m now 20th in Search race with 13822 time
 cegprakash: jrke chill I'll come for you
 cegprakash: :D
 jrke: ya i know
 cegprakash: I'll get you
 cegprakash: what's  ur depth
 jrke: cz you can sim and use GA but i can't
 jrke: i m not simming
 jrke: nor GA
 cegprakash: jacek no the very first image why is the ball not moving in the direction until it hits the wall?
 jacek: because it can't. in second (or third) image it can
 jacek: because the ball ends up on already drawn line
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/hiZn3nr.png">https://i.imgur.com/hiZn3nr.png</a>
 cegprakash: I mean the left image
 cegprakash: why doesn't the ball travel till the wall
 eulerscheZahl: because you only move to the next free intersection
 jacek: it goes only one square at a time. 
 cegprakash: I only get extra move if I bounce on enemy or bounce on wall?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess that's another case for "read the rules"
 cegprakash: rules no clear
 cegprakash: like always
 jacek: o.O
 eulerscheZahl: literally unplayable!!11!11!
 jacek: try yinsh
 eulerscheZahl: try codechef
 struct: yinsh for true ai
 struct: I might change playerUI though
 struct: I could also optimize the viewer a bit
 struct: I draw too many lines
 Illedan: 3rd in Yinsh. With 1 if :rocket:
 struct: :D
 Illedan: Always pick the longest string xD
 struct: yeah
 struct: true ai
 Illedan: No idea about how long actions works
 struct: long actions = multiple actions
 struct: to do more than 1 you must remove 1 ring
 struct: thats why it work
 Illedan: aha
 jacek: sometimes you must remove ring first because opponent left with your 5-in-row
 struct: yeah that can also happen
 struct: so you remove the ring then move
 struct: can also remove move remove remove
 struct: or even remove remove remove and not move
 jacek: and sometimes remove remove, acount remove, move
 WINWINWIN: I finally hit top 500 global&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i missed top 100 in contests by a narrow margin&#160;:/
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl how did kotlin heroes go?
 AntiSquid: struct i beat your yinsh bot in D lang
 AntiSquid: huehuehue
 WINWINWIN: D is that bad?
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN we shouldn't stop until we rekt anid 
 cegprakash: we riot till anid
 cegprakash: rank drops
 Xcalibre: that's the spirit
 WINWINWIN: Exactly :D
 WINWINWIN: But first I need to really struggle for top 200 now :sob:
 cegprakash: is there a referee for mars landers
 struct: no
 cegprakash: then how do ppl land their spacecraft
 cegprakash: without a simu
 Uljahn: the referee is called physics
 cegprakash: can I use search race simu for Mars lander
 cegprakash: both are 2D so it should work right
 struct: Do you think all 2d games have same physics?
 Astrobytes: wtf
 cegprakash: the law of physics is the same on the same dimension right? In ant man movie that's what the professor says
 Uljahn: pls stop embarrassing yourself
 Astrobytes: There should be a Book of Ceg channel on discord, with notable ceg quotes.
 WINWINWIN: Some of the rules are too different on mars lander
 WINWINWIN: but someone tried a GA and it worked
 cegprakash: are u telling me there is a non GA solution to land the ship safely
 cegprakash: i.e. for all test cases
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 cegprakash: :o
 WINWINWIN: Thats what I did&#160;:)
 Uljahn: ofc, but it could be not optimal by fuel consumption
 cegprakash: oh wait I see the difference now.. search race is on earth and mars landers is on Mars
 WINWINWIN: :D
 cegprakash: I should learn mars physics
 Xcalibre: but in mars lander u need to account for the gravity of the situation
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 Uljahn: also there is no friction and thrust has inertia (can't step more than 1 point per turn)
 Uljahn: i think ideal rocket equation would be interesting to have in mars lander optimization :relieved:
 wlesavo: wonder if GAimax would work for mars lander :slight_smile:

 Imsure1200q: lol you can referee if you like cegprakash i think its possible
 struct: you already have sim Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Nah, I just played around a bit. Nothing serious yet;
 Astrobytes: *yet.
 Astrobytes: You can tell I've been coding when I finish my sentences with a semicolon eh
 wlesavo: lol
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: WINWINWIN 11:51AMeulerscheZahl how did kotlin heroes go?
 Astrobytes: Still brutal
 eulerscheZahl: and the visible testcases were all on a square matrix, so i didn't notice&#160;:/
 Merhablar: dadigger
 TheFakeLoremIpsum_46b9: --cabinet moison
 struct: euler have you got any experience with .net core?
 eulerscheZahl: not much. why?
 struct: Was thinking on learning it
 eulerscheZahl: that's just the framework to run your code. like JVM
 eulerscheZahl: you don't learn JVM, you learn Java (or Kotlin, Clojure, ...)
 eulerscheZahl: it doesn't really matter if it's .net Core, .net or Mono
 eulerscheZahl: so think about learning C# or VB.net, F#
 struct: I have been trying C#
 eulerscheZahl: personally i wouldn't recommend VB
 struct: Im enjoying it
 Astrobytes: VB is pretty horrible
 struct:  I used Visual basic before
 eulerscheZahl: C# is a nice language. started as a Java clone but really evolved after
 struct: My problem with C# is everytime I need to do Console.Out.WriteLine()
 struct: I do System
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: miscrosofts response to a lawsuit with Sun Microsystems
 Astrobytes: Used to be J++
 Astrobytes: right?
 eulerscheZahl: Console.**Out**?
 struct: ok the out is not needed
 struct: but I still write it
 eulerscheZahl: in visual studio or similar IDEs just type cw[tab]
 AntiSquid: what's wrong with c++ that people don't like it?
 eulerscheZahl: preconfigured snippet
 struct: I dont dislike c++
 Astrobytes: I like it
 AntiSquid: some even use java, but say c++ is hard to read / code&#160;?!
 struct: That works euler?
 struct: Nice tip
 eulerscheZahl: depending on your IDE
 struct: It works :D
 struct: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: you can also define your own snippets. which helps for contests like codejam
 eulerscheZahl: primesieve? here it is!
 struct: Im gonna try net core web app
 struct: lets see how it goes
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl what was that diffchecker?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.diffchecker.com/">https://www.diffchecker.com/</a>
 WINWINWIN: I meant what was its significance
 Astrobytes: Look at the difference between the two code files
 Astrobytes: You'll see the significance
 WINWINWIN: Yes, he got 0% in a puzzle because of that??
 Astrobytes: w and h were swapped
 WINWINWIN: Extremely unlucky&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Which failed once the test cases were not square matrices
 Astrobytes: Yeah, horrible way to lose
 exxtremewa: that moment when the poor guy who uses the language that can't math properly loses the speed challenge
 struct: Which langauge cant use math?
 WINWINWIN: bash?
 AntiSquid: the site or the code?
 WINWINWIN: what site?
 AntiSquid: weird, why does the chat not automatically scroll&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ignore it 
 cegprakash: did someone say diffchecker. it's my fav website
 cegprakash: wlesavo u don't understand GAimax
 cegprakash: u can't use it on mars lander because there is no opponent 
 cegprakash: u need an opponent to use any kind of minimax
 WINWINWIN: what is GAimax?
 cegprakash: my twitch recording got corrupted 
 cegprakash: is there anyway I can download the video from twitch?
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash diffchecker is your favorite website? :oyou put that over CodinGame?
 eulerscheZahl: if the recording is on your video overview page, JDownloader does a good job at downloading them
 lifetimeLearner007: BeyondCompare software for desktop is also good right?
 eulerscheZahl: never tried that. I use Meld (meldmerge.org)
 lifetimeLearner007: I guess a web app is more convinient
 struct: cegprakash<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://appuals.com/how-to-download-twitch-vods/">https://appuals.com/how-to-download-twitch-vods/</a>
 Daher: hey guys, is there a way to compete with only java coders in CoC
 struct: no
 lifetimeLearner007: u can filter leaderboard based on language and manually compete with each in the CG IDE.
 AntiSquid: yeah wlesavo learn gaymax before asking stupid questions
 wlesavo: i think with right attitude you can use it even with no opponents
 cegprakash: The moment when I reached top 20&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/SmallHardElkHeyGirl">https://clips.twitch.tv/SmallHardElkHeyGirl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's a weird URL
 ZarthaxX: twitch clip urls, nothing wrong lol
 cegprakash: but it has Small Hard Girl in the random string
 cegprakash: that's really weird
 struct: Go Yinsh, very easy
 eulerscheZahl: funny algo to create slugs.like the CG usernames when you don't set one yourself
 cegprakash:  the best thing I liked about search race is the tyre scratches 
 cegprakash: tyre marks
 cegprakash: I just wish I can see tyre scratches of top players
 cegprakash: see how smooth they are
 Kinlei: how did i get here
 Kinlei: this wasnt here before o-o
 eulerscheZahl: the chat unlocks when you reach level 3
 eulerscheZahl: which you just did i guess
 Kinlei: ohhh
 Kinlei: thank you
 cegprakash: I got 466 views today that's amazing :D 
 cegprakash: welcome to the world chat Kinlei :D
 Kinlei: thanks
 Kinlei: im a bit thick
 Kinlei: but i try
 Kinlei: l0l
 cegprakash: thick&#160;?
 cegprakash: lol
 Kinlei: my brain is thick like wood
 cegprakash: been there
 cegprakash: I still am
 cegprakash: to some ppl
 cegprakash: AntiSquid and Astrobytes troll me
 darkhorse64: Just playing catchup with your stream: I am afraid its title is misleading what your are doing is not a GA but a MC
 cegprakash: all the time
 Kinlei:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: darkhorse64 MC? no way
 darkhorse64: It is 
 cegprakash: MCTS goes till end of game
 darkhorse64: I said MC
 cegprakash: I only go to a constant depth
 eulerscheZahl: MC&#160;!= MCTS
 cegprakash: MC&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: which is very different to monte carlo tree search
 cegprakash: what is MC
 cegprakash: and how is it diff from GA
 eulerscheZahl: do you even read what i'm writing?
 Kinlei: like i just had this one where its like
 Kinlei: - - -
 Kinlei: |o| | | | |
 cegprakash: link wiki plz eulerscheZahl
 Kinlei: made no sense to me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method</a>
 darkhorse64: Generating random solutions and keep the best without retaining anything from previous solutions
 jacek: new search! GAMC!
 darkhorse64: GA combines previous solutions to find a better one
 cegprakash: jacek stop trolling me like wlesavo AntiSquid Astrobytes 
 cegprakash: I do mutation darkhorse64
 cegprakash: wait for it
 eulerscheZahl: sorry ceg. but you qualify for being trolled
 jacek: :c
 cegprakash: how do u know previous solutions are better darkhorse64
 cegprakash: u have to sacrifice to get better solutions for the future
 cegprakash: what I do is optimal and safest for any game
 darkhorse64: I am at 2:40 and all is see is random solution generations without mutation
 cegprakash: yeah I'll be adding it
 cegprakash: to reach top 20
 darkhorse64: *all i see*
 cegprakash: wait for it
 darkhorse64: No problem. I find i even quite interesting that you can use MC to drive the car
 darkhorse64: *find it*
 darkhorse64: Whether MC is optimal is doubtful to me. GA does better
 cegprakash: why do nobody agrees what I use is what I use
 Kinlei:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i agree that you use what you use
 eulerscheZahl: would be hard not to use what you use
 Astrobytes: It's usually just not what you say you use.
 darkhorse64: I do not agree how you name what you use
 Astrobytes: As in, what you use is not usually what you say you use.
 darkhorse64: ^
 Astrobytes: Then when we say what you are really using you deny it and complain that we don't agree that what you use is what you say you use.
 Astrobytes: Clear?
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: I am lost
 Astrobytes: (Last part was a mild troll, but the point stands)
 cegprakash: so it was MCimax?
 Astrobytes: Just MC
 cegprakash: no I mean for pacman
 cegprakash: it was MCmax
 cegprakash: not a GAimax
 Astrobytes: OK.
 cegprakash: so how exactly we use the existing results in GA
 cegprakash: we do prune?
 cegprakash: now don't troll about prune arrays.. I'm asking seriously
 cegprakash: if I do mutation on MC do u still call it a MC 
 cegprakash: or can it be called as GA??
 AntiSquid: how do you do that mutations?
 darkhorse64: Been making progress on your stream. I see after a MC step, you mutate your best solution. That's better but you miss the point of GA which is to combine best solutions not only mutate them
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: if you don't do mutations a la GA then imo it's a different algo
 Astrobytes: Have you checked out the GA tutorial on tech.io cegprakash? It's in Python, but it's a nice clear, simple intro to GA concept
 darkhorse64: Just for curiosity, how many sims do you have in 50 ms&#160;?
 cegprakash: like 35K sims + 35K mutations
 AntiSquid: i think this pic is enough:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*BYDJpa6M2rzWNSurvspf8Q.png">https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*BYDJpa6M2rzWNSurvspf8Q.png</a>
 AntiSquid: just my opinion
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's straight to the point
 WINWINWIN: Unable to process image?
 darkhorse64: A sim is 8 turns&#160;?
 AntiSquid: copy it all
 Astrobytes: Take the unhighlited text too WINWINWIN
 AntiSquid: including the part after the *
 Kinlei: Lua &gt; All :3
 WINWINWIN: Thanks, understandable
 WINWINWIN: Kinlei Lua, really??
 Kinlei: Yessir
 Kinlei: Lua very naisu
 WINWINWIN: :D
 cegprakash: so if I add cross over and mutation to monte carlo I can call it a GA?
 AntiSquid: in a way
 WINWINWIN: GA has a population, but MC is a single solution
 Kinlei: I've not been coding long, I think Lua is a nice starting language&#160;:)
 cegprakash: what is the diff between monte carlo and simulated annealing
 AntiSquid: get 100 moves from MC and from there you apply the mutations and crossings
 WINWINWIN: Simulated annealing is MC with mutation/crossing
 AntiSquid: and then you move on to next generations
 WINWINWIN: MC is pure random
 cegprakash: u all confusing me
 cegprakash: I'll call everything CEG algo
 cegprakash: or CEG search
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN there's a bit more to simulated annealing than that
 WINWINWIN: And I`ll call them WIN algo/ WIN search :P
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes what is the other component?
 AntiSquid: gaymax is already a powerful word ceg
 Astrobytes: It has a temperature coefficient
 cegprakash: what u guys are saying is 
 AntiSquid: correct
 cegprakash: SA = MC
 cegprakash: and SA = GA
 cegprakash: which means MC = GA
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: nobody said that
 Astrobytes: It's based on metal annealing, where you heat and cool metal in a specifically controlled way to achieve smoother surface
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes how does temperature apply?
 Astrobytes: Well, better crystallisation technically I suppose
 cegprakash: if we do GA as per <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*BYDJpa6M2rzWNSurvspf8Q.png">https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*BYDJpa6M2rzWNSurvspf8Q.png</a>
 cegprakash: we can get into a population explosion
 cegprakash: and we may have to restrict reproduction of genes
 Astrobytes: Do you know basic hill climbing algo WINWINWIN
 AntiSquid: ceg are you arguing against the very definition of GA&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and yes you do a cut off
 AntiSquid: you don't need to use all 
 cegprakash: that's like Thanos
 cegprakash: unfair
 AntiSquid: 50ms
 AntiSquid: nothing to do with Thanos though
 cegprakash: Thanos cuts off half the ppl
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes, I have some understanding of hill climbing
 cegprakash: just like u cut off half the genes
 AntiSquid: Thanos = randomly cut in half, could have suicided too
 WINWINWIN: have never applied it
 AntiSquid: you take the best ones ceg
 cegprakash: but that's so wrong
 AntiSquid: taking the best solutions is the right way
 cegprakash: how many should I take
 AntiSquid: your anthropomorphisation is the one thing that is wrong here
 AntiSquid: you can keep the limit to 100 or whatever you like
 Astrobytes: Right, well it's that but with randomly chosen moves, if it's good you keep it, otherwise you like have a probability which is based on the energy of the system and the temperature. You reduce the temperature (the cooling) the further you progress the more the algo is just like hill climbing. Higher temps increase probability of getting a higher result. So it's to avoid getting stuck at local maxima
 cegprakash: wuuuuuuuuut I need the top 100 :o
 JBM: Astrobytes: i've adapted/merged many of your suggestions
 AntiSquid: gave random number
 AntiSquid: you take as many as you want
 cegprakash: crossover gave me very bad results in the past and I stopped doing crossovers
 AntiSquid: that's the point, you need to adjust your numbers yourself
 Astrobytes: That's essentially SA WINWINWIN
 Astrobytes: JBM: Nice&#160;:)
 JBM: i'm not too sure about the music ones (look more like jokes than trolls) and movies (don't understsand them all)
 WINWINWIN: how will that prevent getting stuck at a local maxima?
 cegprakash: we can't crossover when the current move is very much dependent on previous state
 AntiSquid: when right value is reached you make a random jump WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: understood now, thanks
 Astrobytes: And with the higher temperature, your probability is higher, probability of better move decreases with temp, and it reduces to basic HC
 Astrobytes: All good JBM
 Astrobytes: Which movie ones did you not get JBM?
 cegprakash: are u guys talking about NN or GA
 cegprakash: because what u guys talk sounds like NN to me
 AntiSquid: no
 Astrobytes: GA to you, SA to WINWINWIN
 AntiSquid: wrong
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: very wrong ceg
 cegprakash: wait what :O SA uses NN 's tricks :o
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: What are you on about?
 cegprakash: I've seen in NN tutorial about hill climbing and local maxima and stuff
 AntiSquid: ceg again not sure if you trolling or ...
 Astrobytes: Well... you know... optimisation etc... . . .
 Astrobytes: I really, really, REALLY think you should go off and do some reading
 cegprakash: AntiSquid I learnt NN theory here&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk</a>
 cegprakash: my friends in big places said he's a legend
 Uljahn: hill climbing is very close to gradient descent
 AntiSquid: i am not gonna click the link, you got the theory wrong
 cegprakash: well it has 180000 likes
 AntiSquid: ok i clicked, you got the theory wrong . the video doesn't even confirm what you say
 cegprakash: see Uljahn is right
 cegprakash: u need to check chapter 2 AntiSquid
 cegprakash: on Gradient Descent
 AntiSquid: no
 cegprakash: that talks about hill climbing, local maxima and stuff
 Astrobytes: cegprakash this one has 5.5M likes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 Astrobytes: And yes, I did say earlier:Astrobytes 05:58PMWell... you know... optimisation etc... . . .
 AntiSquid: i've seen the video before btw ceg, you're still very wrong GA&#160;!= NN
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 WINWINWIN: I generally prefer files to videos, are there any good documents to learn NN?
 JBM: Astrobytes: how the spoon one was  a troll; the moon; how the real boy was a troll
 Uljahn: but gradient descent is not NN per se, it's just one of many optimization techniques
 AntiSquid: his initial argument which i called wrong is that GA == NN
 cegprakash: this time I give up
 Astrobytes: The spoon one, "There is no spoon" - Matrix, The 'real boy' is Pinocchio, I just thought it was amusing since he's not a boy, he's a troll
 AntiSquid: you shouldn't give up, you should check the theory again imo
 Astrobytes: The moon - "That's no moon, that's a space station" - Star Wars The Something Or Other
 struct: anyone has good tutorial for true ai?
 JBM: i recognized both movies, but wasn't "moved"
 JBM: ah ok
 JBM: no moon but a space station i would've recognized
 Talchane: Hi there
 Uljahn: struct: you mean AGI?
 JBM: but you write "you imbecile"
 JBM: which led google to completely different stuff
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's my humour&#160;:(
 JBM: there's room for everybody's humor
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) do any of you top guys do much bot programming now?
 Astrobytes: But anyway, I'm glad you liked some enough to implement&#160;:)
 JBM: it just has to be thoroughly explained outloud before to make sure it's no fun to anybody anymore

 AntiSquid: ya he was referring to Artificial General Intelligence, struct, but powered by if-else somehow
 AntiSquid: or maybe that's the joke i missed?
 eulerscheZahl: or a full simulation of every possible state
 eulerscheZahl: or the opposite of it? i forgot
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN they are not top guys
 cegprakash: they are just trolls
 WINWINWIN: they are really good with theory, I just get to silver/gold and give up
 cegprakash: yes I agree they sometimes teach awesome stuff
 cegprakash: especially MadKnight 
 cegprakash: and Astrobytes sometimes
 cegprakash: but other times he's sick
 WINWINWIN: :D, I am no longer last in Yinsh
 Astrobytes: Sick?
 cegprakash: like confuse
 Uljahn: how's your back Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I taught you loads the other day/night, and I've just explained SA to WINWINWIN
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl doesn't teach but he's like a make a gif get 100 likes kinda guy
 Astrobytes: Terrible Uljahn, no better. I have an MRI scan soon for it
 AntiSquid: my reply to that is that one of those trolls pushed ceg to legend in pacman contest and then he moaned he didn't magically get higher rank
 Uljahn: sad news
 WINWINWIN: Hope its nothing dangerous Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Me too WINWINWIN, but I like to go with the flow rather than worry needlessly 
 Astrobytes: Well, I like to try
 Astrobytes: cegprakash wth do you mean euler doesn't teach?
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl always asks to look tutorials and read statements. Doesn't actually helps
 cegprakash: we ask only coz that didn't help
 AntiSquid: wrong ceg
 cegprakash: but he says to go back there
 cegprakash: that's harsh
 AntiSquid: euler does help a lot and AutomatonNN is proof for that
 AutomatonNN: fog of war is a bit close
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: people keep asking euler
 AntiSquid: for every little thing
 JBM: the memorable name
 JBM: so clash-like
 Astrobytes: Actually, if you have a specific and reasonable question he will explain the answer in great detail. A lot of questions he gets are just really common or silly
 Astrobytes: cegprakash
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, me most of all&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: your turn ceg
 AntiSquid: teach the chat the way of the gaymax
 JBM: oh, new alg?
 JBM: shiny!
 cegprakash: well he is #1 I'm not saying he can't be showing off
 struct: Why should he explain stuff?
 struct: There are plenty of resources online
 cegprakash: he doesn't have to but he insult back
 cegprakash: saying go read tutorials
 Astrobytes: "shiny!" Firefly reference JBM?
 cegprakash: stopping others to help me
 JBM: could be O:-)
 struct: He insults?
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ya
 JBM: talking of refs
 JBM: was "wicked" in common use in the UK before HP?
 AntiSquid: he indirectly called ceg dyslexic by telling him to read statement
 eulerscheZahl: then go to my profile and click the report button to file an official complain
 Astrobytes: HP?
 struct: telling to go read tutorials is insulting?
 JBM: harry
 Astrobytes: Oh *that*
 Astrobytes: Yes
 JBM: ok
 struct: lol
 JBM: with my more american culture, i couldn't tell
 cegprakash: he says go read problem statement struct
 cegprakash: do u know how insulting that is
 JBM: didn't you?
 WINWINWIN: Is this the code for AutomatonNN?
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/git-tej/CGBot2">https://github.com/git-tej/CGBot2</a>
 AutomatonNN:  you like that bot. the summer is the same as the code and the opponent can be a good cooperate with
 Astrobytes: Since the 80s at least, 70s in some places. I think it originated from the Afro-Caribbean population JBM
 JBM: asking questions about stuff that's under your nose is kind of insulting IMHO
 AntiSquid: when you say HP and UK i am thinking of HP sauce <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://d36rz30b5p7lsd.cloudfront.net/561/studio/assets/v1565088885381_472263571/HP%20Big%20Ben.jpg">https://d36rz30b5p7lsd.cloudfront.net/561/studio/assets/v1565088885381_472263571/HP%20Big%20Ben.jpg</a> JBM
 struct: tbf sometimes it doesnt seem you read statement at all
 JBM: lol
 eulerscheZahl: my response depends on who is asking. it's just that you repeatedly ask about a case that's explicitly described. of course it can happen. i miss some parts as well
 JBM: before jkr it just meant computers to me
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl is racist towards me
 struct: the race card
 struct: nice one
 JBM: what race are you?
 eulerscheZahl: just a matter of how often you ask something that's given in the statement, which gives me the impression that you watch a replay and try to guess the rules without reading sometimes
 struct: You should keep talking sh*t
 Astrobytes: How is euler racist to you ceg?
 JBM: he told him to read the statement
 struct: very racist
 JBM: that's racism 101
 struct: I would sue if someone told me that
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 WINWINWIN: Is this the NN or 2000 Automaton?
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CGBot2">https://github.com/Agade09/CGBot2</a>
 JBM: when i find someone i want to be racist to
 JBM: the first thing i do is find a statement for them not to read
 JBM: so i can let loose all my racismness
 Astrobytes: Excellent approach.
 JBM: i don't knw another
 JBM: there probably *is* no other
 JBM: i should build a true ai to explore whether or not there are others
 struct: racists?
 Astrobytes: Sounds like a fun project. 
 JBM: racismitudes
 AntiSquid: going too far cegprakash
 struct: I agree with AntiSquid
 JBM: i find it hard to be racist here
 struct: Jokes asides
 cegprakash: "my response depends on who is asking" if this is not racism I don't know what is
 struct: what he said is wrong
 JBM: i don't even see the other people's race
 JBM: i just have to assume the worst
 struct: How the fuck is that racist?
 WINWINWIN: I thought that this is too short to be a neural network <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CGBot2">https://github.com/Agade09/CGBot2</a>
 Astrobytes: cegprakash WTAF dude
 eulerscheZahl: and I admit that my behavior changed over time: 1 or 2 years ago i probably would have copied that part of the statement and not just tell you to find it yourself. the same type of question asked again and again (public chat or private message) lowered my motivation to be overly helpful on simple questions
 JBM: well he'd have a point if it depended on race
 JBM: but we haven't proof of that yet
 CommanderCero: @WINWINWIN he uses tensorflow, which abstracts a lot of the optimisation stuff etc
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u can always ignore 
 CommanderCero: thats why its so short
 cegprakash: just don't tell me to read problem statement
 WINWINWIN: Thanks CommanderCero
 cegprakash: and stop creating a troll thread
 cegprakash: there are good ppl who will help
 cegprakash: that's my point
 eulerscheZahl: true. sometimes i do ignore. sometimes the tourett part of me kicks in :P
 jacek: :o
 eulerscheZahl: no, i don't have tourett. just not thinking much before typing
 AntiSquid: it's your behavior too cegprakash that causes it, nothing to do with your genes
 AntiSquid: or maybe it's your epigenetics idk
 AntiSquid: but not race related
 struct: I dont think its a race thing
 Astrobytes: I know, let's ask eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: now u blame my genes AntiSquid?
 cegprakash: u call my father has bad genes?
 AntiSquid: there's like 100 other people from india that join chat and ask new-commer questions
 Astrobytes: CEG STOP THE TROLL
 cegprakash: report AntiSquid plz
 AntiSquid: i blame your inherited behavior yes
 AntiSquid: your personality
 JBM: only half of his genes are proven bad
 cegprakash: AntiSquid u crossing the line.. I stop here.. bye
 AntiSquid: and actually i said maybe
 AntiSquid: but it's still behavior related
 AntiSquid: i crossed the line ceg?
 eulerscheZahl: "nothing to do with your genes""now u blame my genes AntiSquid?"
 JBM: there's a word for that attitude, no?
 JBM: "only read in as much as to support claims of oppression"
 eulerscheZahl: trump-ism?
 cegprakash: epigenetics
 JBM: confirmation bias on victim syndrome?
 AntiSquid: inherited animal instincts
 AntiSquid: your personality / behaviour
 Astrobytes: So many straw men...
 JBM: i'm not good enough, but i can't face it, so i *have* to find an alternative explanation elsewhere
 cegprakash: "i blame your inherited behavior yes"
 AntiSquid: and again not sure if it's inherited or learned or willed ignorance
 struct: JBM does FR have this drama?
 eulerscheZahl: they talk about shitty community puzzles getting approved
 jacek: like yinsh
 Astrobytes: And baguettes.
 Astrobytes: Obviously.
 struct: Thats racist jacek
 jacek: thats structural
 AntiSquid: cegprakash you do lack reading comprehension
 struct: You dont like yinsh because you dont like me and that makes you racist against portuguese
 JBM: struct: nope
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com//training/hard/big-bang-theory---sheldons-array-puzzle">https://www.codingame.com//training/hard/big-bang-theory---sheldons-array-puzzle</a>
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: yeah, some of them do... a LOT
 struct: Did they trash yinsh yet?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 WINWINWIN: I liked yinsh...
 eulerscheZahl: the puzzle i liked is a copy from hackerrank
 JBM: mmm i'll let you know when it happens
 Astrobytes: I'm looking forward to getting into Yinsh properly at some point
 JBM: but it's mostly directed at low effort stuff, so mainly clash/classic io
 wlesavo: is it real accs though? seems like some kind of abuse euler 
 JBM: i recall reading a line or two about yinsh, forgot what
 WINWINWIN: JBM But bad puzzles will not get approved
 eulerscheZahl: approvers wre most likely alts
 JBM: WINWINWIN: they do now
 eulerscheZahl: and these also approved space maze
 Astrobytes: There was an issue with that previously
 Astrobytes: (the acceptance thing)
 JBM: the threshold for having approval rights is much lower (relatively) (and absolutely, for clashes) than it used to
 JBM: and most of the more "strict" approvers got discouraged
 JBM: (that includes me)
 WINWINWIN: Does it make much difference for classic puzzles? THey are purely voluntary, CoC puzzles on the other hand should be well thought out
 Astrobytes: I like to check out some of the rubbish that gets posted in the contribs sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't approved for a year i think
 struct: There should be a filter
 JBM: rum time, catch you later tonight
 struct: I dont like to check for CoC
 struct: And more than hlaf is CoC
 Astrobytes: nice JBM, until later
 Astrobytes: I only ever approve multis
 Astrobytes: Sometimes I comment on clashes if they're worthwhile and there's a mistake, but won't upvote or approve since I don't clash
 tov: hey
 struct: I was checking the list, and there is a plain copy paste of CG  game
 struct: lol
 jacek: ohai
 Astrobytes: The fish one right
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i used to refuse clashes that are almost identlcal to existing ones. but CG added a moderation guideline that explicitly allows duplicates now
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the fishy game too
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I followed that topic eulerscheZahl in the forum and on the clashes, I find it odd
 struct: I was checking multi guidelines
 eulerscheZahl: a while ago someone uploaded pong
 struct: and I feel like I miss half of thme
 AntiSquid: well as long as multis and optimization puzzles don['t become to similar
 WINWINWIN: AntiSquid what about Pr1 &amp; PR2
 Astrobytes: They're pretty well regulated AntiSquid I think, there's a decent bunch of people willing to test here at the moment
 wlesavo: AntiSquid well that would be a precedent which would require an actuall action from stuff
 Astrobytes: So if something is more or less the same as something, it's not gonna get far
 Astrobytes: Though I did find the 2 player/4 player versions of the same game a bit... odd
 Astrobytes: Or 3 whatever it was
 struct: "The total entities should not exceed 200."
 struct: :D
 struct: Privilege the use of Sprites over Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, etc.)
 struct: yeah
 struct: I still remember vindi
 eulerscheZahl: so it can handle more than 200 without killing your tab now
 eulerscheZahl: vindi was a pain :D
 struct: with 1GB on ide
 eulerscheZahl: i gladly updated the SDK version
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i still should update bender :see_no_evil:
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to update at one point but animations weren't playing with higher version
 eulerscheZahl: turned out to be a bug which i reported later
 eulerscheZahl: fixed now
 AntiSquid: winwinwin&#160;?
 AntiSquid: missed the comment about the NN, wanted to link some shorter examples
 WINWINWIN: Im here AntiSquid, shorter examples?
 WINWINWIN: A neural network shorter than 200 lines?

 AntiSquid: its from a book
 WINWINWIN: Its a fascinating topic, are there any good focuments to study it?
 WINWINWIN: or will they teach the basics when I go to college?
 tov: About w&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i would research online, college or not
 WINWINWIN: neural networks
 AntiSquid: colleges / schools tend to follow a curriculum
 AntiSquid: lots of shit not covered + there's always new stuff coming out
 Astrobytes: And brush up on your linear algebra
 WINWINWIN: Am studying a lot of it now anyway&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you might find it in optional Master courses. most likely not in basic classes
 AntiSquid: or just read the code example if you can find any online, the math formulas can give headaches Winter_not_comming
 tov: Astro, do you work on the Codingame website&#160;?
 tov: Anti*
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN *
 AntiSquid: no 
 eulerscheZahl: you can detect staff by the [CG] at the start of their name
 WINWINWIN: I know basic IMO math, not much more than that
 WINWINWIN: is it sufficient?
 AntiSquid: i just google what i don't know, so hard to tell :p
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: first time i see someone from nauru @tov, didn't not it even exists
 AntiSquid: "see"
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: how can tiny islands have airports @_@
 eulerscheZahl: no idea on which continent to search for it
 WINWINWIN: Oceania
 AntiSquid: it's near australia
 Astrobytes: Micronesia
 eulerscheZahl: would have been my guess by the flag
 eulerscheZahl: australia / new zealand
 cegprakash: search race definitely has timeout issues
 Neumann: Yup, but that concerns everyone so not a problem
 Counterbalance: argh... SIM BUG: angle mismatch: expect 0 got 6.28319 0 &lt;= angle &lt;= 360
 Neumann: *cries in radian*
 Astrobytes: :D
 Counterbalance: referee apparently uses 361 degrees :D
 tahsin314: Trump's racist
 MSmits: What an original observation
 AntiSquid: didn't you write that yesterday in chat?
 MSmits: apparently he didn't change his mind since then
 Astrobytes: About the same time too iirc...
 Astrobytes: Hi MSmits
 MSmits: hi
 AntiSquid: well Biden has dementia and there's a 100% chance every other candidate has a flaw
 AntiSquid: a serious flaw
 MSmits: are you baiting the troll now AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: just random rambling
 MSmits: ahh RR
 MSmits: R&amp;R
 Astrobytes: Started with Yinsh yet MSmits?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: have you?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but it's just a True AI
 MSmits: oh ok
 Astrobytes: 3rd place, I don't expect that to last long
 MSmits: will you upgrade it to false AI&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Possibly.
 MSmits: Depending on your language, it might be enough to put a "!" in fron of your source code
 MSmits: pro tip, take it or leave it
 Astrobytes: The Wise Man speaketh
 MSmits: indeed
 AntiSquid: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
 Astrobytes: lol, damn tags
 Counterbalance: !function(){}()
 MSmits: hi Counterbalance
 Counterbalance: heya msmits
 Counterbalance: grats on getting #1 in nl
 MSmits: thanks again for helping me with my class a few months ago, got a 10 in that
 MSmits: oh and thanks for that too&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: ahh nice - hope you learned something though&#160;:)
 MSmits: I learned something sure. But I didn't like the class much
 MSmits: doing an AI class now, way more fun
 Counterbalance: I bet
 MSmits: well I actually finished it in 4 days, but it was fun 
 MSmits: have to wait 2 months for the test now 
 MSmits: I binge-homeworked it
 Counterbalance: It was probably nothing you didn't already know?
 MSmits: I knew about half. 
 Astrobytes: You had the first-order logic stuff
 MSmits: yeah that was new, some other stuff, but the assignments were pretty easy
 MSmits: I think an average legend bot takes about as much time as all homework assignments I did for this class
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToLmVF1xneo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToLmVF1xneo</a>

 MSmits: Space force!
 MSmits: oh it's only Elon musk
 Counterbalance: 54% humidity?&#160;:)

 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrUya51bD_Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrUya51bD_Q</a> higher quality

 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: cant fail with malkovich and carell I think
 Astrobytes: I'll wait a bit before watching Space Force I think
 inoryy: I binged it, expected a bit more of an office vibe but it was alright as well
 Astrobytes: I have other priorities, need to do Better Call Saul as recommended by you MSmits
 Astrobytes: hi there inoryy
 inoryy: hello&#160;:) 
 MSmits: hi
 Astrobytes: how's things? Didn't see you around for a bit
 pb4: What's "first order logic"&#160;?
 Astrobytes: predicate logic
 inoryy: yeah, have been busy with work mostly, don't really have time or energy for CG atm
 Astrobytes: all good, hope it's going well&#160;:)
 inoryy: trying to come to terms that our office most will most likely stay closed until end of the year&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Maybe you know it as first order predicate calculus pb4?
 pb4: Nope
 Astrobytes: Can't be easy doing this kind of work from home inoryy
 pb4: end of year&#160;?!
 inoryy: I mean, it could be worse I guess, some people started after the offices were closed
 pb4: That seems very far away&#160;:/
 inoryy: yeah, indeed
 MSmits: explained here pb4... if you have time. 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/1/">https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/1/</a>

 pb4: Didn't know the name, knew the concepts
 inoryy: it's weird, lockdown being lifted while mayor of London says that we should still stay home &amp;  wear masks
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 inoryy: anyway, how are things with you guys, what's new?&#160;:)
 pb4: A *real* RPS game&#160;:)

 MSmits: ahh finally something for the trolls to do instead of bugging us here
 inoryy: lol haha wtf
 Astrobytes: It's worth it for the troll sprite alone
 pb4: It's not at the point *yet* where people play the game well enough that you can detect bias in how they play
 Daher: how to play Coc with only java coders?
 Astrobytes: And Yinsh is finally finished too
 Alshock: you can't Daher
 Alshock: unless you make a private CoC with people who swear they'll code in Java
 Daher: Well it is not fair, it take a lot of time compared to python to write code
 Alshock: well it's not unfair, you're just choosing a language unfit to the task
 Astrobytes: Use python then :P
 Astrobytes: Alshock is correct, you need the right tools for the job
 Alshock: when people code AIs in Python they are disadvantaged against Java coder, because the language is globally slower
 Daher: i dont know  python
 Daher: i useonly  java and c 
 Astrobytes: JS, Bash, Ruby
 AntiSquid: use D
 Alshock: You can use this as an excuse to try and learn a quick-to-write interpreted language, or you can try to make your best with java
 Astrobytes: Best do puzzles and/or multiplayer bot programming then Daher, unless you wanna learn as Alshock says
 Alshock: or you can stay in Java/C and focus on the rest of the site where they're much better choices.
 <b>**Astrobytes hugs Alshock because the Unicorn is the national animal of Scotland</b></p><p><img src="/a/44525782531717" /> Daher: that's a good idea but i also like the idea of Coc, it is funny and cool to play
 <b>**Alshock hugs back the drunk unicorn in kilt   :D &lt;3</b>
 Astrobytes: Well, do some tutorials on one of the aforementioned languages and come back to CoC when you're ready - it'll be a lot more rewarding 
 Astrobytes: lol Alshock :D
 Alshock: yeah it's short and can be pretty fun. But you should think of this as a challenge against yourself then, and not look the ranking
 Daher: Yes,that's right, anyway gonna try a bit with C and see what happens
 Alshock: C is worse than Java IMHo
 Daher: yes harder but also less verbose 
 AntiSquid: gaimax referenced in troll vs castles?
 Astrobytes: Yeah :D
 AntiSquid: 19 hours until the 2 muricans arrive at the space station? damn that's a lot to spend in such tiny space
 Astrobytes: Sounds like prep + service at one of my old kitchens at Christmas AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: one of the pubs i worked at had a bedroom with shower next to the kitchen (which was upstairs)
 AntiSquid: head chef used to sleep there some of the days 
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've worked in a few live-in places. Didn't live in thankfully apart from the odd drunken crash when I had a day off next day
 AntiSquid: well a repurposed flat 
 Astrobytes: In my web dev job we had a futon that slept two. Spent many a 5 hours on that.
 Astrobytes: sofa&lt;&gt;futon convertible thingy
 AntiSquid: can't find much info about the interior of the dragon module: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SpaceX-00602-Pano.jpg">https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SpaceX-00602-Pano.jpg</a>
 AntiSquid: where do they shit / eat in there
 Astrobytes: looks like the kitchen at AWT Grill
 Astrobytes: (size wise)
 AntiSquid: 30-50 tables and a small toilet-sized kitchen? Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: Yep. It was literally a tiny strip at the far end of the dining area, just past the bar. Slightly more room at the bar end (dessert/cold section). Got changed in the basement
 Astrobytes: Open plan
 Astrobytes: WAsn't 30-50 tables tho
 AntiSquid: was a joke
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://awtkewgrill.com/take-a-look/">http://awtkewgrill.com/take-a-look/</a>
 AntiSquid: but it's usually something equally ridiculous
 Astrobytes: Closed now&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Place was stupidly busy
 AntiSquid: interior looks nice
 Astrobytes: Oh it was right posh
 Astrobytes: It was Anthony Worrall-Thompson's place
 Astrobytes: You know, shoplifter extraordinaire :P
 AntiSquid: i wonder if people realize what it means for a place to be busy, what might go on in the kitchen during busy hours
 Astrobytes: They don't.
 Astrobytes: Trying to keep a chateaubriand warm in that kitchen without it overcooking was a near impossible task
 AntiSquid: let me guess, regular tables of 4-6 people expecting their food to come out perfectly at the same time? :D
 Astrobytes: Standard procedure!
 reCurse: lol wtf was that drama
 struct: lol
 struct: Fun right?
 struct: You are talking about ceg drama right?
 reCurse: Yeah
 Astrobytes: oh, that earlier ceg stuff
 AntiSquid: had to do that in a kitchen with dumbwaiter, except there's a draft pulling through, sundays were fun with food coming back
 Astrobytes: You've missed loads of it past few days reCurse
 reCurse: Oh noes
 Astrobytes: Same AntiSquid, basement kitchen in a pub in South Ken.
 struct: You missed the new algorithm discovery
 AntiSquid: the only thing you missed is the chance to be called racist for even talking to ceg
 Astrobytes: At least we now have a permanent chat log :P
 struct: But im gonna stop joking about it, he seems to get mad about stuff easily
 AntiSquid: joking about what?
 struct: The Gaimax
 Astrobytes: *seems to manage to construct a straw man to counter every single criticism/piece of advice you mean?
 AntiSquid: if i wrote GAimax in chat i would expect people to laugh it, or i would assume i failed to deliver the joke properly
 AntiSquid: about it *
 struct: I dont understand sometimes he just seems a troll
 struct: but I cant be sure
 Astrobytes: No, it's real
 Astrobytes: There's a slight language issue plus the overconfidence thing, plus complete unwillingness to ever take a path other than that of least resistance when approaching any problem.
 Astrobytes: Apart from that, he's quite a nice guy tbh. But...
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.spacex.com/updates/nasa-selects-lunar-optimized-starship/">https://www.spacex.com/updates/nasa-selects-lunar-optimized-starship/</a> wow maybe i get to see a lunar landing during my life time lol
 AntiSquid: i mean on live broadcast
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert conspiracy theory here&gt;
 Counterbalance: I did find it odd that the cameras went dead on final separation and falcon landing
 Astrobytes: Yup
 Counterbalance: 'tadaa'
 Astrobytes: I missed it and actually my mother texted me to watch it and check out the cut transmissions lol
 AntiSquid: well you can play the docking sim:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://iss-sim.spacex.com/">https://iss-sim.spacex.com/</a> dock dragon to the ISS
 JBM: "apart from all the flaws that prevent him from being a nice guy, he's quite nice the guy"
 Astrobytes: Essentially JBM yes
 JBM: yeah i know a fes like that
 JBM: *few
 JBM: like, all of them
 Astrobytes: Next CG optim AntiSquid, separate, land the Falcon, dock - and don't lose the transmission :P
 Counterbalance: it did look a lot like KSP at times
 struct: I already have ticket to visit the moon, Ill take yinsh with me
 JBM: take care
 JBM: it's full of stars
 Astrobytes: *trolls
 struct: Have you been there?
 JBM: i live there
 struct: Is the moon also flat?
 Astrobytes: That's no moon, it's a...
 Counterbalance: Mun!
 JBM: from where i am, yes
 JBM: as flat as that flat ruond earth
 struct: Does the moon also have oil if we dig it?
 JBM: dunno, haven't tried
 AntiSquid: did you try that sim Astrobytes? looks very difficult
 Astrobytes: You'd have to be a lune-atic to try struct
 Astrobytes: Nope AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: i failed to position the modul correctly
 AntiSquid: RIP
 Astrobytes: Bookmarked for tomorrow
 struct: damn staturns moon has oil
 struct: Im gonna invest
 Astrobytes: Why am I drifting away into space lol
 AntiSquid: you need to adjust the thrusters correctly
 struct: How long until we colonize space?
 Astrobytes: There's no kbd shortcuts for  roll L/R and translate F/B?
 struct: 7 and 9
 struct: on num key pad
 AntiSquid: WASD worked for me for left side controls
 ArianPunk: anyone done the Closest Number
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've got a 10 keyless Ducky
 Astrobytes: No num pad
 ArianPunk: anyone knows why C outputs zero for no reason?
 Astrobytes: and yeah wasd + arrows are fine, just hoped for moar shortcuts
 Astrobytes: docked yet AntiSquid?
 Alshock: @ArianPunk can you give more details?
 Neumann: tenkeyless ftw
 Astrobytes: You know
 AntiSquid: what? i am doing something else
 AntiSquid: too difficult to dock 
 AntiSquid: i kill all on the ISS
 Astrobytes: I was so close, then I got it stable and backed off a bit cause I needed a pee, came back and screwed it, ragequit
 Astrobytes: Not easy
 AntiSquid: need CG port
 AntiSquid: basically mars lander 3D
 Astrobytes: For sure. struct, your next game.
 AntiSquid: struct when is it ready?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/0YOibN0.png">https://i.imgur.com/0YOibN0.png</a>
 struct: wtf
 AntiSquid: bullshit, only the sun is flat
 journeyvivek: ooh u said the b word
 journeyvivek: im telling your mommy
 Astrobytes: Hush now Vivek
 AntiSquid: there's people on your proprety go an chase them journeyvivek
 struct: Give physics and port it easy
 journeyvivek: who
 Uljahn: that docking thing is easier than zx-spectrum elite&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Get MSmits on the case struct
 Astrobytes: I had to pee. Plus painkillers. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.
 Astrobytes: Ragequit was justified :D
 JBM: Astrobytes: that was me messing up the gits
 JBM: thanks for re-reporting, sending the patch up now
 Astrobytes: No worries&#160;:)
 JBM: there, fixed again
 Astrobytes: Nice one JBM. 
 AntiSquid: journeyvivek either the natives wanting their country back or probably some riots going on
 JBM: thx ^^
 datavnt: ix()
 journeyvivek: who wants to play roblox
 Astrobytes: Wrong website.
 Astrobytes: Trop bon LeRenard! :clap:
 LeRenard: Merci
 JBM: what did the rest of us miss?

 JBM: oh, gg then
 Astrobytes: Yep. He just absolutely destroyed pretty much everyone.
 Astrobytes: Will be interesting to see Eric and tric's responses tomorrow
 struct: Yavalath flashbacks
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: How about that score eh struct
 struct: score?
 Astrobytes: the fox, his score
 Giths: maul?
 Giths: jo
 Giths: jo
 Giths: jo
 Astrobytes: Le Renard's score struct
 struct: Its good, but its still a bit early
 struct: Those who played Yavalath have a little advantage I guess
 Astrobytes: Yes, but it was rather impressive how Eric climbed a while ago, then renard came back with that. Early days or not
 struct: Yeah, its still impressive
 Astrobytes: Only the top 3 are serious right now, that's what I'm watching
 Giths: jo maul
 Astrobytes: Give it a rest Giths
 Giths: fick dich
 Astrobytes: Riiiight
 Giths: hi
 Astrobytes: Hey struct, notice top 3 are Thales? darkhorse64 next&#160;:)
 struct: Damn did not notice
 Giths: AUF
 struct: Maybe thales can ask me to make a challenge :p
 Astrobytes: Ask them :D
 Astrobytes: Giths, stop or we'll set the mods on you
 struct: Did thales ever sponsored CG contest?
 struct: oh they did
 Neumann: Yup
 Astrobytes: they also had a few internal "semi-private" hackathons we participated in
 Giths: stop what?
 Giths: im innocent 
 Giths: maul astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm off to watch some Breaking Bad before sleep. Gn/bn everyone
 Giths: auf
 struct: gn
 MSmits: gn
 Astrobytes: Someone ban that Giths dude already
 Astrobytes: Making my teeth itch
 Neumann: I wish I was a mod
 Giths: halts maul
 Neumann: ping reCurse
 Giths: ban me for what?
 Giths: give me a good reason
 Illedan: Spamming wierd messages.
 Giths: spam?
 Giths: where's the spam pal
 Unbound: maul dude
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: 98&#160;%
 Illedan: Who makes this shit
 Giths: yikes, no spam
 Unbound: 1v1 me on coding game
 Giths: what a surprise 
 Unbound: pal
 Giths: pal
 Giths: skids
 Unbound: jo
 daffie: go home
 Unbound: maul?
 Giths: AUF
 Unbound:  am busy coding
 wlesavo: Illedan SR?
 Illedan: yeah
 wlesavo: lol
 Neumann: lul
 Illedan: I passed every test but Longest on submit
 Neumann: Timeout&#160;?
 Illedan: seems my code didn't win that at all :D
 Illedan: It is just BAD
 Neumann: Haha
 Illedan: But I got 15k after giving more score to getting CP earlier
 Illedan: So I got that going, which is nice
 Neumann: :ok_hand:
 Illedan: 527 on longest :tada: gotta be a record
 Unbound: the minimum number of bits required to code it
 Unbound: please fix this one, wording is misleading
 Unbound: to what the answer actually wants
 Neumann: You're supposed to minimize time Illedan, not maximize :stuck_out_tongue:
 Illedan: Damn, didn't get that part. Who wrote this statement
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: I had a major bug in my code where I could pass a checkpoint at any point in time. Making my pod stand still and just circle around to take all at once :P
 Neumann: :upside_down:
 Giths: maul
 Unbound: maul pal
 Illedan: Tests looks sooooo much cooler with a decent bot driving :raised_hands:
 Illedan: Having a node with some heuristic works nice in addition to -18 0 and 18
 Neumann: Doing GA&#160;? SA&#160;?
 Illedan: MC now
 Illedan: Will convert to SA
 Neumann: What's a node, in a MC&#160;?
 Illedan: Just an action I can select between
 Illedan: 3 angles and 2 speeds
 Illedan: or 1 extra which does -3 vel
 Illedan: So I have some initial population with -3 vel
 Neumann: I see
 Illedan: (I do some mutations)
 Illedan: Not really a population with 1 individual
 Neumann: You're describing GA
 Illedan: Yeah, but I will start my SA on -3 vel
 wlesavo: lol also have a node in mc but in hypersonic
 Neumann: Is that a popular term&#160;? Node&#160;? First time I'm reading that in that context
 struct: I wouldnt call it a node
 Illedan: From SmitsiMax I started called an action to select between Node
 wlesavo: dont think so, but i accumulate results for 4 moves
 Illedan: I'm off to bed, cya
 Neumann: gn
 wlesavo: gn
 struct: ng
 struct: gn
 DragonJ: if my thrust code is optimal and my prints are optimal why am i still in bronze?
 DragonJ: with CSB
 Snef: because they aren't optimal
 DragonJ: I shouldn't need to use gold code for beating bronze
 Snef: define gold code
 DragonJ: code from gold league
 Snef: are you the one who did that "gold code"&#160;?
 DragonJ: most of it(90% of it)
 wlesavo: -3vel gold code
 DragonJ: that is not gold thats magic numbers...
 Snef: your bronze code is also magic numbers
 Snef: but on thrust only maybe?
 DragonJ: my code has no magic numbers besides the changing radians to degrees and using optimums, I cant refine any more without using BS
 struct: What is your target?
 struct: Are you targeting middle of checkpoint?
 DragonJ: I can refine that by 50 units but I have tried and it has no impact on effectiveness 
 Snef: watching your replay your code is for sure not optimal
 Snef: you always aim center of cp + you always output thrust between 85 and 100
 DragonJ: 86 and 100 even  though my code sometimes goes over for handling exception cases
 Snef: yea that's the same
 Snef: but still it's bad
 Snef: either change aim or thrust
 DragonJ: I have tried tweaking thrust and aim but both made my code do worse
 struct: after you see the checkpoint for the first time you can  store it
 struct: after the first lap is done you can start aiming towards next checkpoint
 struct: when you are close enough to the current
 Snef: struct look at his replay he need to first improve basic things
 Snef: he sometimes miss cp
 Snef: you didn't tried tweaking enough
 Snef: in wood league you had tutorial with things like&#160;:if angle &gt; 90 thrust = 0
 DragonJ: I have tried that, the result I consistently have when I try that is my code misses nextpoint when aiming ahead
 Snef: "aiming ahead"
 Snef:&#160;?
 Snef: you don't aim ahead
 LelouchVC2: In wood league, the fucking contest wasn't broken
 LelouchVC2: 🤪
 Snef: you jsut need to slow when you aren't going in the right direction
 Snef: it's useless to boost 85 when you go at the opposite of next cp
 Snef: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52eadca0-d182-412a-9686-788215a1cb7d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52eadca0-d182-412a-9686-788215a1cb7d</a>
 DragonJ: but vector products sometimes distance outweighs the angle
 Snef: you don't need to do vecto products
 Snef: expecially when you don't handle that 
 Snef: if you don't know how to do things good =&gt; keep it simple
 DragonJ: if I am far of track printing the right direction helps cancel drift
 DragonJ: far off
 Snef: you always print next cp 
 DragonJ: I tried that and it didn't work
 Snef: i'm trying to give you advice
 DragonJ: it would totally miss the first point because aim would cause drift to dissapear
 Snef: it has nothing to do with the aim
 Snef: you are always aiming next cp
 Snef: if you have big angle with it and outputing 100 as thrust ofc you'll miss it
 Snef: you just need do to if to avoid that
 Snef: like if dist &lt; 3000 &amp;&amp; angle &gt; 30 thrust = 50
 Snef: but you didn't tried enough
 Snef: try again to do simple stuff
 Snef: you'll get better result for sure
 DragonJ: will try what you said but will revert if it isn't better. Any other tips?
 Snef: You shouldn't try what i said and revert if it doesn't improve
 Snef: You should try to see the problem of  your pod behavior
 Snef: with replays
 Snef: what i saw from few replays is that you need to reduce more your thrust when you have great angles with next cp
 Snef: and to avoid missing next cp reduce thrust when dist is low and angle is still not tiny, but you ahve to test abnd adjust those numbers
 DragonJ: The problem with reducing thrust when close is I still need to deal with bumps
 Snef: you can get to gold ignoring collision
 Snef: you just have to run efficiently
 DragonJ: I have recorded what you said is that it or do you have other thoughts?
 Unbound: maul!
 TheoreticalPandaOfDoom_1bed: hello
 IamTheSmix: hello everyone
 IamTheSmix: what is the best alorithm to choose for tic tac toe problem&#160;? 
 markasoftware: machine learning (genetic algorithm, neural net, etc)
 markasoftware: i can point you to a few academic papers for some introductory reading
 daffie: for tic tac toe? machine learning and genetic algorithms&#160;?
 daffie: you're joking
 daffie: also the weekly is broken
 daffie: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/470225630">https://www.codingame.com/replay/470225630</a>
 daffie: if someone can look into that or explain it if I'm mistaken
 daffie: looks like it's only triggering the loss when a player tries to plant a flower for more than they have gold to pay for
 daffie: yea and due to the fact that soil costs nothing, it allowed 0 balance
 daffie: so nvm

 cheesecake_assassin: Hey
 Wontonimo: solved it
 Wontonimo: i guess i'm lucky now
 Wontonimo: gn all
 martinpapa69: any c4 expert here&#160;?
 cheesecake_assassin: fbi wants your location
 martinpapa69: fbi does know my location
 cheesecake_assassin: Hot!
 Wontonimo: i'm okay at c4
 Wontonimo: 19th
 martinpapa69: I checked this bitboard article for c4. and he has a bitshit isWin function
 martinpapa69: but i cant leave 1 row and 1 culomn free
 martinpapa69: what now&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what article?
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md">https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md</a>
 Wontonimo: my encoding just uses 1 uint64_t per player
 martinpapa69: yes
 Wontonimo: the article is a 6x7 board
 martinpapa69: yes
 Wontonimo: what's your question?
 martinpapa69: he utilizes a free row and culomn for a fast is_win function
 martinpapa69: do you have any solution for that&#160;?
 martinpapa69: as we dont have enough space
 Wontonimo: yeah
 martinpapa69: mind sharing&#160;? :D
 eulerscheZahl: there are 2 ways
 Wontonimo: one solution is to use uint128_t
 eulerscheZahl: 1. use int128_t
 Wontonimo: oh, thanks euler.  it's late for me
 martinpapa69: noo
 martinpapa69: i want to use int64
 eulerscheZahl: 2. use the 64 bit version. and before checking for remaining 1s you do a bitmask that completely hides a part of hte bitboard
 Wontonimo: ^^ me too
 martinpapa69: that was my idea too
 Wontonimo: ng
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. when you shift up for vertical rows you do board &amp; 0b00011110001111...
 eulerscheZahl: for me the int128 was faster
 martinpapa69: to mask the map around the last played piece in 5 radius
 martinpapa69: so i cant step out of the map
 eulerscheZahl: just mask in regards to row check direction regardless of the played bit
 martinpapa69: or just max the farthest sides
 martinpapa69: mask*
 martinpapa69: ye something like that
 martinpapa69: okay so some drawing homework for me i guess
 eulerscheZahl: pretty simple to find the masks
 eulerscheZahl: i had them but deleted
 martinpapa69: or i will just bruteforce a mask for every position
 martinpapa69: at start
 eulerscheZahl: still a bigger lookup array for your masks
 martinpapa69: or ill calculate a distenca from the bit, which is '1', after i apllied the bit operations of the is_win func 
 martinpapa69: from the last used piece
 martinpapa69: if its greater than 4 its a false positive
 martinpapa69: ye, thats what ill do
 eulerscheZahl: i have doubts about the correctness of this
 martinpapa69: its correct
 eulerscheZahl: place a 1 in the middle vs at the top with some 1s at the top of the previous row
 eulerscheZahl: what's the difference in those cases?
 martinpapa69: the bitsifts go in one direction
 eulerscheZahl: this time you typed the f in bitshift&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: :D
 martinpapa69: the distance cant be greater than 4 ever
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just trust you to get it right. and if it's wrong, it's not my problem anyways&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: :D
 ProCoder03: where can we learn Trees in C#&#160;??
 xxd: class Node
 xxd: how is the performance of int128's?
 xxd: are they native?
 xxd: the extra row+col strategy is interesting, but i'm not sure if MSmit s allowed_moves function still works
 michaellan: i think it'll work with some tweaking
 michaellan: but i think the mask idea is a bit less hectic, altho euler says its slower :sad:
 Almin5k: Goodmorning everyone, if you’re changing the world, you’re working on important things. You’re excited to get up in the morning.
 Westicles: Repetition is how we learn!
 ProCoder03: @Westicles, I can understand we need to practice , But the conceptual knowledge&#160;???
 Westicles: I was referring to Almin5k's copypasta from yesterday
 Almin5k: It comes from the heart
 peppers: u really a philosopher  bro.
 Almin5k: thanks man
 ProCoder03: So we need to learn from other's code, Thanks @Westicles&#160;!!!
 Westicles: Yeah, Larry Page was quite the prophet
 ProCoder03: i don't understand&#160;??
 Westicles: Almin5k is quoting Larry Page
 Almin5k: No Larry Page is quoting me
 Almin5k: im the ghostwriter
 peppers: imm curious about how u guys learn english...some question really really hard to understand
 KRALLEE: HELLO GUYS THE KING IS HERE
 Almin5k: Godmorning spongebob
 KRALLEE: BOW DOWN SQUIRREL
 Uljahn: you can't be the king here if you suck at coding sorry
 KRALLEE: NEW ACCOUNT AND BOW DOWN U CAT
 Uljahn: why so caps and rude? guess i should kick you
 KRALLEE: MY KEYBOARD IS BROKEN I CANT FIX IT
 Almin5k: good vibes only:raised_hand:
 Almin5k: Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity.
 MrKovi: Hello guys, i just joined codingame, i am trying new ways to learn coding, i am currently learning python, any advice for me?
 Uljahn: besides using search?
 MrKovi: it depends if you have better advice than just using search, for every problem
 Uljahn: this site is meant for practice, it could be hard for a complete beginner to start here
 Uljahn: so i'd suggest to use some tutorials on the web
 MrKovi: I have completed courses over python, i just didn't find the right motivation to start practicing, with a little practice and competition.
 Uljahn: ah, i see. have you tried bot AI games?
 MrKovi: not yet
 Uljahn: try this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 Uljahn: if you don't like it, there are more
 MrKovi: thank you, i will search for more!
 elio27: The others are much harder 
 elio27: Or maybe I'm just absolutely stupid
 Armin_programmer2010: hello everybode
 Armin_programmer2010: everybody
 Armin_programmer2010: :sweat_smile:
 elio27: hi&#160;!
 Armin_programmer2010: how are you?
 Uljahn: btw some multis provide a list of valid actions for your bot, so you can simply choose one of them
 Armin_programmer2010: hey guys how can i anwer multiply anwers in coC in print
 Armin_programmer2010: i mean clash of codes
 Uljahn: which one?
 elio27: in one line or each in a different line&#160;?
 Armin_programmer2010: in reverse mode
 Armin_programmer2010: in one line
 Armin_programmer2010: please answer
 Almin5k: A hello sends a message of welcome of acknowledgment and of worth. To ignore someone is to say to them that they are not worthy of your attention. Make it a point to say hello, warmly, and with a smile.
 Armin_programmer2010: what!?
 Almin5k: Hello&#160;:)
 Armin_programmer2010: ok:smiley:
 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: hi
 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: hello

 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: ok
 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: when the brain goes numb u can call that mental FREEEEZEEE
 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: guys u wont believe what happened a guy named christian just dropped my airpods and now im very much sad and depressed faze up guys 
 Uljahn: are you guys really interested in coding? if not you'd better find another place for casual chit-chat
 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: SO WE'RE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT WE WANT MAN ISNT THIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH OR WHAT AM I RIGHT Almin5k???
 Almin5k: Nobody is perfect. We all make mistakes and do things that hurt other people at some point in our lives. That’s why it’s important to acquire the ability to acknowledge your mistakes and apologize for your wrongs, even if you didn’t do it on purpose. Im sorry
 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: preech
 Uljahn: you have been warned btw, you are free to discuss coding related topics here
 Uljahn: Almin5k: there's no need to copy-paste random quotes in the chat, it's a warning
 Almin5k: Okay sorry i will stop preaching, but it comes from the heart:fist:
 KINGGGGGGGGGGG: DO U EVEN HAVE A FUCKING LIFE MAN GET SOME BITCHES ON UR DICK MAN HOLY SHIT U SIT AT HOME PROBABLY LIK 30+ RIGHT NOW AND MODDING ON A GARBAGE ASS SITE THAT NOBOBY CARES ABOUT IF U THINK YOUR THE BOSS THEN THATS REALLY PATHETHIC MY BROTHER PREACH AND #BLM FOR OUR FUTURE FREE MY MAN KRALLEE HE AINT DONE NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!
 Uljahn: flooding the chat with offtopics is disrespectful to the community

 Acquira: wait It automatically went to a pastebin for a  smaller message than king's spams. 
 Uljahn: your message has too many linebreaks i guess
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: hello&#160;!is the source of DeepMind's AlphaZero chess available  somewhere&#160;?
 Acquira: Indeed, that might be the case.
 Uljahn: MounirEnmeiRyuu: dunno but Automaton2000 algorithm is available here on CG
 Automaton2000: how good are you at now?
 Uljahn: Acquira: im not proficient with php sorry
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: Ok, thanks
 martinpapa69: alphazero source is not puplic, but there is a public replication

 realBillGates: hi guys
 realBillGates: i need some help with "imagine" coding if u know what that is

 Uljahn: im midgold with flat UCB1
 Uljahn: random for bronze i guess
 ProCoder03: Nahh... I tried random 
 ProCoder03: only top 100
 Uljahn: add some win checks

 ProCoder03: np ..
 kolpaja: what do you suggest me to start doing?
 ProCoder03: then how&#160;??
 ProCoder03: kolpaja: try descent and temperatures
 TobiasA: i checked all the available moves and chose the one that leads to a win in either miniboard or mainboard
 Atanasius: p

 Wontonimo: thanks Astro
 Astrobytes: you're welcome
 Lekrkutj: how did u guys learn to code
 Astrobytes: Practice.
 Wontonimo: wow, the list of CG mods on the list is large today
 Uljahn: start simple
 Wontonimo: i started by transposing choose-your-own-adventure stories into if/else code with lots of prints
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Everything builds on the basics. Without having a solid foundation you won't get much further.
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: good example. Also simple word games,  guessing games etc.
 Wontonimo: actually, not even if/else.  it was GOTOs&#160;!
 Astrobytes: :D
 ProCoder03: Wow&#160;!!! one of Linq is working while the same in another is not working 
 ProCoder03: what a weird situation&#160;!?!
 darkhorse64: wontonimo: is there a "PID for dummies" somewhere&#160;? I am curious about your approach. I have used GA only for ML2/3 for optimization purposes

 ProCoder03: I am not even getting the Count of list , it is just blank&#160;!!!
 alowaniak: None of the UBoard[1-8]==0?
 ProCoder03: nahh... every thing is zero in the start 
 ProCoder03: public int[] UBoard = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
 Uljahn: add more debug outputs to be sure
 KRALLEE: hey guys
 Wontonimo: hey spongebob
 ProCoder03: This is awesome&#160;!!! , the same code in my history works. But now it isn't :sob:
 Wontonimo: that doesn't sound awesome.  perhaps we have different definitions :P
 ProCoder03: sarcasm&#160;!!!
 Wontonimo: me too&#160;!!!
 ProCoder03: I copy pasted my code and now its completely broken....
 Wontonimo: hey darkhorse64 , tbh about Mars2 I didn't do "all of it" as PID.  Just the X direction is PID controlled using a gentle banking of around 15 or 28 degrees and thrust 4 as the "steering" to get over the landing pad.  Then switch to Mars1 logic for landing
 Wontonimo: no collision detection, just landing detection
 darkhorse64: Hover than land. Got it&#160;!

 Wontonimo: finished "The Lucky Number" yesterday (that's not the interesting bit).  What was surprising is that it took 0.0024 seconds for my python code to solve it.  I thought it was going to be fast enough, but that's overkill
 Q12: Nice!
 Wontonimo: not just python, but hacky string manipulation with splits instead of integer math
 elio27: hey, what's the easiest bot battle exercise after coders strike back&#160;?
 Wontonimo: easy in what way?
 Wontonimo: easy to start and get something working or easiest to get to legend?
 elio27: oh yeah sorry I forgot to precise
 elio27: easiest to start
 Wontonimo: there are a few multis where all the legal moves are provided in a list on every turn.  These are pretty easy to start because you can make a basic bot that just picks one move randomly
 Wontonimo: Spring Challenge 2021, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe fall into these
 jrke: tron can be easy start i think
 Wontonimo: Something like Tron is pretty easy because there are just 4 directions
 Wontonimo: and you can do well just by going in the same direction as last time, or turning if you are going to crash
 elio27: Okay thank you&#160;!
 Wontonimo: if you know flood fill so you can make an informed decision about how much space is available, even better
 Wontonimo: Connect 4, also fits into the category of fairly easy to start.  There are only 9 moves (and 1 steal)
 jrke: oware!! only 6 valid moves at max
 jrke: Tron 4 moves at first turn then 3 moves max
 Wontonimo: yeah!  are the moves listed in the output?
 Wontonimo: for oware?
 jrke: nope
 Wontonimo: which one interests you elio27?
 elio27: I think Tron 
 jrke: depth 1 is enough for tron if i am not mistaken
 elio27: It looks cool and interesting at the same time
 jrke: till silver league
 Wontonimo: yeah, i got to silver with depth 1
 rndmlck: can someone explain to me what you have to do in the reverse mode with the numbers? A little pointer in the right direction would do a lot. I try to figure it out but I have no idea... It's not binary at least.
 elio27: I will try, thanks&#160;!
 Wontonimo: wait till the clash is over and look at other peoples solution
 Wontonimo: that's the easiest
 rndmlck: Thank you, didn't know that was possible
 jacek: the point of reverse clash is to find it yourself
 BlaiseEbuth: You mean... Thinking?! :scream:

 FiveRivers: For the race I've unlocked the ability to use "BOOST" but when replacing the power value with "BOOST" as it says, I receive an error saying BOOST is not defined.
 FiveRivers: code: console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' ' + BOOST)
 Wontonimo: console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' BOOST')
 Wontonimo: there you go
 FiveRivers: Alright, so the output needs to be boost and it isn't a defined variable.  Thanks.
 Wontonimo: the only defined values are the ones in your code

 Wontonimo: that's strange, some random numbered chat tabs showed up and I haven't been doing anything other than the musical scores challenge
 Astrobytes: known bug
 Astrobytes: (cause unknown)
 Astrobytes: ah grats on lvl 30&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: thanks.  maybe being level 30 makes me able to drink milk
 Wontonimo: i'll try it out
 Swyfti: but don't we already drink milk?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i was just thinking about how dumb that power would be.  Man, why would they even make that the level 30 unlock?  CG is strange 
 Wontonimo: you'd think they'd make it more useful, like moderation of profile pics
 Astrobytes: I don't drink milk.
 Astrobytes: levelling up is levelling up.
 BlaiseEbuth: So deep...
 Astrobytes: :D
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: I used alpha-beta search in the ULTIMATE TIC-TAC-TOE, and got ranked 69th in the Gold ranking.
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: do you think alpha-beta search cannot be better than monte-carlo&#160;?
 Astrobytes: MounirEnmeiRyuu: nice one! There are alphabeta bots in Legend league
 Astrobytes: Most use Monte Carlo tree search though
 jacek: its difficult to come up with decent eval in uttt
 jacek: so this is good ranking
 Astrobytes: yep
 Wontonimo: are you using bitboard MounirEnmeiRyuu&#160;?
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: no bitboard, just simple optimized C code
 Astrobytes: pragmas?
 Zyabrik10: Send a message to say hello!
 Astrobytes: bitboards and/or the right pragmas and you'd be in Legend
 Wontonimo: well, bitboard could probably increase your depth by another 2
 Astrobytes: Need to know if he has the pragmas
 jacek: the suspense is killing him
 Wontonimo: if you arn't using killer move, that could also equal another 1 depth
 jacek: killer move in uttt?
 Wontonimo: why not?
 jacek: uttt is very context based
 Astrobytes: maybe history heuristic
 Wontonimo: alpha-beta killer move
 Swyfti: i like ultimate tic-tac-toe irl with my friends
 Wontonimo: you don't think it would help jacek?
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: okay, I see
 jacek: whenever specific move would be available, the entire board will be quite different. i never tested, i think it wont work much
 Astrobytes: the code is compiled with no optimization MounirEnmeiRyuu, so you have to specify things via pragma directives
 Wontonimo: it's a general and safe optimization on top of alpha-beta pruning that sorts the moves as to maximize pruning
 jacek: i know
 DR_IQWDJ: is there a way to input nested arrays like [1,[1,3,[1]]], when making a contribution?
 Astrobytes: I haven't checked either but not sure it would work in UTTT. ID with best last depth move sure
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: I mixed the alpha-beta with iterative deepening in fact, starting from depth 8
 Astrobytes: Nice. 
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: it reached usually depth 13, 14 by the end game
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: I occasionally beat MightyCarlo, but he wins most of the time
 Astrobytes: A bit more optimisation and you'll be Legend for sure.
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: do you the mean the code is built in debug mode&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: then what is the pragma to enable this optimization&#160;?
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,unroll-loops,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 jacek: add this as first lines (above the includes
 Astrobytes: Also, check this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/58302/using-pragma-for-compile-optimization">https://tech.io/playgrounds/58302/using-pragma-for-compile-optimization</a>
 jacek: by saying alpha-beta, im assuming you mean iterative deepening
 AllYourTrees: must be nice to be able to specify compile args in code :eyes:
 Astrobytes: Eh. You chose to side with Ferris!
 AllYourTrees: ya just being crabby :D
 AllYourTrees: its part of the job
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: thanks!
 jacek: is it faster?
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: i'm testing it out
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: It doesn't seem to be better, but maybe I need to tune some timing parameters. Will check it later.Thanks anyway!
 michaellan: Swyfti: UTTT is opaque
 Takos: hello, has anyone worked with CodinGame API? in that case where could i get a list of all notification types and type groups?thanks in advance
 Swyfti: uttt is opaque? it is not transparent? what does that mean xxd
 Swyfti: xxd: is there something special about ultimate tic-tac-toe?
 michaellan: its not trivial for a human to determine the state of a UTTT game
 michaellan: i.e., given a position, determine who's winning/losing
 MSmits: Astrobytes I still want to try for that article. Do you think people will appreciate if I explain how to generate an endgame book for oware?
 MSmits: I think i'd like writing that
 MSmits: I mean an ingame one btw
 MSmits: not this local craziness that I do
 Astrobytes: I reckon so yes MSmits
 MSmits: allright then, I'll try to finish that this week then
 Astrobytes: You've accumulated a wealth of knowledge
 MSmits: yeah there's a couple games on CG i could talk about for hours
 Astrobytes: Is that just an excuse not to finish your NN? :P
 MSmits: err mostly not :P
 MSmits: but maybe subconsciously some
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 BlaiseEbuth: If you'd like to write it, why do you wonder about people needs? Just write it.
 MSmits: but the article thing was also on my list. I was gonna do uttt, but I prefer sharing things that I came up with myself and uttt would just be a compendium of stuff most longtime players know
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth i like it more if it's also used 
 Astrobytes: UTTT would still be useful, would save a *lot* of chat time
 MSmits: very true
 michaellan: your enthusiasm has piqued my interest for it
 michaellan: (oware)
 michaellan: yeah, i'm probably part of the problem for UTTT and wasting chat time
 MSmits: I'm not even sure i like the game oware per sé, i just like that it is simple and that you have a lot of options to do things with it
 MSmits: like it's relatively easy to do NN. You can write an eval for it and try mcts + eval, you can try opening books and endgame books etc.
 michaellan: how does an opening/endgame book work in a bot
 michaellan: does the bot say, "hey that looks like X position, switching to book moves"
 MSmits: there's many ways to do it
 MSmits: i like to use endgame books as part of the search
 MSmits: so you go down the tree and if the state is simple enough, you do a lookup and solve that ndoe
 MSmits: node
 MSmits: in oware, my bot does a look up if the number of seeds goes below 10
 MSmits: sometimes that means perfect play for half the game
 MSmits: and sometimes it's useless
 MSmits: storing it can also be done in various ways. In Bandas i have a long string hardcoded. In oware, i generate the endgame book in half a second so it's not  a string in the source code
 MSmits: thats what I'm going to share
 MSmits: nn guys should like that it doesnt take much codesize, except the function itself
 MSmits: I'll pseudocode it, but should be easy enough 
 michaellan: i am getting closer to gettin c4 gworking
 Endless_void: i cant code
 Endless_void: how do i learn
 RightHandElf: I just got notified that my Coder Strike Back bot is moving up to silver league when it's been days since I did anything with it
 Endless_void: wwwwwwwww
 michaellan: thats awesome RightHandElf 
 michaellan: nothing better than free cash
 michaellan: YES MY THING WORKS
 michaellan: okay time to add pie rule and test in arena&#160;:)
 michaellan: well i take that back: working for your level-up is better than not working for it
 michaellan: the dumb boilerplate for the CG input is taking a awhile to write
 The_wolf_of_the_silicon_valley: lmao
 The_wolf_of_the_silicon_valley: hello guys
 michaellan: hi
 Wontonimo: hi
 Wontonimo: it's late here
 michaellan: hi wontonim o
 michaellan: I think I'm pretty close 
 michaellan: (this time for real)
 Wontonimo: to what?
 Wontonimo: what are you close to?
 Wontonimo: C4&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i see you have a bot running on c4 right now
 michaellan: yeah its buggy when i'm second
 michaellan: but i'm gonna fix it
 michaellan: also how can you tell I have a bot on c4?
 Wontonimo: why's that?  does it mess up on steal?
 michaellan: No, not steal. just plain second
 michaellan: steal is actually pretty simple logic for me
 michaellan: just swap the root player
 michaellan: (i think, right?)
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4/leaderboard?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4/leaderboard?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS</a>
 Wontonimo: showed that your bot was running
 michaellan: ah
 michaellan: well i can feel it in my clutches
 michaellan: its so close
 Wontonimo: i don't just lurk there, but went on a hunch.  (more like i read the chat history and saw you talk about C4)
 Wontonimo: I have 264 lines of code just dedicated to unit testing my C4 simulation (not including the unit tests for MCTS)
 michaellan: wow
 michaellan: i'm too ignorant to write tests
 Wontonimo: my C4 simulation is only 118 lines
 Wontonimo: so, 392 lines in total
 Wontonimo: 382 ... math
 Wontonimo: I was having some weird bugs that i couldn't figure out from replays
 Wontonimo: also, i didn't trust my bitmask logic 
 Wontonimo: and good thing i did because it messed up on shifting right
 michaellan: i'm currently losing to a guy who stacks them all up in one column
 Wontonimo: yeah, i saw 1 replay like that
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/576232716">https://www.codingame.com/replay/576232716</a>
 Wontonimo: pretty clever winning strategy :D
 michaellan: the numbering is really annoying
 michaellan: i hate the way its numbered
 michaellan: so annoying, i repeat
 michaellan: makes zero sense
 michaellan: so overcomplicatred
 Wontonimo: what numbering&#160;?
 michaellan: wait a sec
 michaellan: the 0 and 1
 AspectCodin: hola
 michaellan: I'm breaking my code 
 Wontonimo: hello AspectCodin
 michaellan:               
 Wontonimo: we are talking about the multi bot battle Connect 4 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4</a>
 michaellan: I would have a working bot if not for this stupid
 michaellan: this is literally horrible for my cognitive effort
 michaellan: because in my game I do not track, at all, who is "me" and who is "opponent" really
 michaellan: but I still arbitrarily use 0 and 1 to alternate
 michaellan: I Hate THis
 michaellan: WEO:IFWJEJF:IOWEJF
 Wontonimo:&#160;;(
 michaellan: how many times can we submit a day?
 Wontonimo: i've never run into the limit
 Wontonimo: but i don't usually submit again unless it has run at least half way through the previous run
 Wontonimo: and i don't use a bot for submitting
 michaellan: what do you mean by "run at least half way through the previous run"
 Wontonimo: like, "send to arena" then not wait for it to finish in the arena and send another version
 Wontonimo: has anyone shared this with you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gekomad.github.io/Cinnamon/BitboardCalculator/">https://gekomad.github.io/Cinnamon/BitboardCalculator/</a>
 Wontonimo: struct shared it with me ages ago
 michaellan: ah
 Wontonimo: i haven't used it, but it may be helpful 
 michaellan: i meant like using "Play again"
 michaellan: not submitting to arena
 Wontonimo: i haven't hit a limit on that either.
 michaellan: aight, thanks
 Wontonimo: but i do a lot of coding locally
 Wontonimo: i was just working on "lucky number" puzzle yesterday and was submitting like mad.  Nothing bad happened
 Wontonimo: are you running into a warning message about too much usage?
 michaellan: no
 michaellan: I just hate my life
 michaellan: WOW
 michaellan: i think i may have fixed it
 michaellan: if so, that was on accident
 michaellan: YES
 michaellan: when i play my bot against myself it takes 53 moves to end the game, i think this is good news
 michaellan: i can feel dopamine already
 michaellan: (and first player wins)
 michaellan: I havent tried to steal yet
 michaellan: Haven't lost a battle yet in arena&#160;;)
 michaellan: I think i did it
 michaellan: oh my god
 michaellan: oho
 michaellan: and i did it even pumping out tones of debug output
 Wontonimo: oh yeah, it's going!
 Wontonimo: haha ... it's destroying wood 2
 michaellan: I'm probably gonna crumble in wood 1 ...&#160;:(
 michaellan: I need to implement STEAL for myself xD
 Wontonimo: you are beating the boss by 6 points
 Wontonimo: that's great
 michaellan: I HAVENT LOST  A SINGLE MATCH YET
 michaellan: lets hope it stays that way
 Wontonimo: yeah, implementing steal with an already working bot isn't gonna be hard
 michaellan: yeah, it seems i just hardcode move 1
 michaellan: but
 michaellan: my entier program is SUPER shaky
 michaellan: i could touch something and break the entire thing
 Wontonimo: why so shaky?
 michaellan: because I am xoring by one everywhere
 michaellan: it is like the equivalent of the classic MCTS "do I negate here or not"
 michaellan: xoring the "current/root player" by 1
 michaellan: ohmygod ohmygod
 michaellan: i think i might get a perfect run, no losses
 michaellan: this feels so good
 michaellan: i wrote win detection with the masks
 michaellan: and i never actually tested it
 michaellan: it seems like it works :rofl:
 Wontonimo: nice, very nice
 Wontonimo: you went from nearly jumping out a window to dancing in about 28 minutes
 michaellan: HAHA
 michaellan: do you use masks or int128s for win detection?
 michaellan: i heard MSmit s uses some super duper weird method
 michaellan: of not playing losing moves
 michaellan: idk how that works in practice/implementation
 Wontonimo: 64bit with masks
 michaellan: yeah but how do you guard against losing positions
 Wontonimo: you are in wood 1 i see
 xxd:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: hmm, i feel competition coming my way
 xxd: Apparently my STEAL deteection is buggy
 xxd: so i'm losing those games dumbly
 xxd: currently 59th... climbing towards you&#160;;)
 xxd: i'm probably gonna drop back down due to my bug
 Wontonimo: in the higher leagues everyone starts with a fair move anyway, so if you get there you can actually skip steal but they will steal from you
 xxd: yeah, they're stealing mine and my program just goes crazy
 Wontonimo: oh, because you can't account for someone else stealing 
 xxd: its hard because since the nodes are reused
 xxd: i have to like

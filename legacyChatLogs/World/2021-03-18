 Scarfield: jaTroll, how did you teach your NN to troll? have seen you promote to both a rook and a bishop xD
 derjack: both rook and bishop? thats queen
 JLukeSkywalker: LOL

 JLukeSkywalker: no, clobber
 Scarfield: yes for chess, and makes sense, didnt think of that
 derjack: well in 99% cases you can get away with queen promotions
 derjack: especially at this level
 Scarfield: lucifer damn it
 InCog: but yeah most of the time they are useless. 
 derjack: but at first i trained my NN tabula rasa to make it 'pure'

 InCog: other than by manually searching the indexOf the element in the array and then assigning it through that

 InCog: like
 InCog: in arr[0] you put a new value
 MadKnight: u wanna replace min value with new value&#160;?
 InCog: maybe the number is 5 before then now you want to put by 10

 polill00: Recently had a CoC I had no idea how to approach: Given a number of cards in a deck, return the minimum required shuffles for the deck to be as mixed up as possible.
 polill00: Calculating how "mixed up" a deck was is by counting how far each card has moved from where it started.
 polill00: Then summing all of those
 polill00: As an example,1, 2, 33, 1, 2 = 3 moved 2 places + 1 moved 1 + 2 moved 1  = 4
 snoyes: I suppose you could try seeing if swapping any two cards results in increasing the sum
 snoyes: that doesn't guarantee you haven't landed on a local maximum, though
 KelvinAndHubbles: is the CodinGame Sponsored Contest actually solvable or is it just a lot of guesswork
 blobonmyknob: elif begin == end: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7b6b8f8-20a5-4ecd-9681-6a4724620da7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7b6b8f8-20a5-4ecd-9681-6a4724620da7</a>
 ErrorRazor: How was the deck shuffled though?
 polill00: #snoyes the biggest problem is that the max has to be achieved via the shuffling method
 polill00: 123456 would be cut like this123, 456
 blobonmyknob: im so frustrated this should work
 polill00: then put together like this
 polill00: 415263
 polill00: 123456 could be aranged like so456123 where each card would be 3 places away from where it started, hence a "mixed" value of 18. Though the maximum they gave was 16.
 Scarfield: cut the deck = mixed up well :thinking:
 polill00: Also if it matters N is always even
 ErrorRazor: ikr

 jacek: oh my
 Scarfield: blobonmyknob and snoyes only write the name to ping
 snoyes: Is it deliberate that the variable are named "begin" there, but "begin_month" elsewhere?
 Scarfield: putting @ before the name doesnt ping here
 jacek: @Scarfield really?
 blobonmyknob:     begin_month = int(months_begin_splitted.pop(0) 
 blobonmyknob: it should output
 ErrorRazor: Well, obviously it's gonna print the first one because the month and day are the same
 snoyes: and if begin == end, then isn't it also true that begin_month==end_month
 snoyes: yeah, what ErrorRazor said

 AntiSquid: also check forums if you want some of the spoilers, i can give spoilers if you wish

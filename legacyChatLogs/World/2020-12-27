 ZzzTRAPzzZ: Tychkorg be my wife &lt;3
 eulerscheZahl: tychkorg is a bot

 YusufEmad04: hey
 jacek: good morning
 jacek: castling rules in 960 are stupid :x
 VizGhar: How often there are community contests?
 leojean890: it seems that CG stopped them
 leojean890: (OOC was an exception)
 leojean890: sometimes, players organize unofficial contests on existing multiplayers outside of CG
 VizGhar: hmm u sure? why does this page exists then? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contest">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contest</a>
 leojean890: because there were a few commnity contests
 leojean890: maybe there will be other exceptions in the future
 VizGhar: Well from the documentation it looks like this is type of "contribution" that has to be approved by CodinGame not community... 
 VizGhar: so that's why there is so few of them
 leojean890: indeed they have to approve because those CC give them additional work to do
 leojean890: they can't do that all the time
 eulerscheZahl: the documentation you linked is outdated
 eulerscheZahl: there may or may not be community contests in the future, CG will decide about that in early January
 eulerscheZahl: (i proposed a completely finished game as a contest, waiting for a response)
 eulerscheZahl: "About community contests, not decided yet. We have a discussion about it at the beginning of January. They might come back but with a different format imo."
 eulerscheZahl: that's all the official statement we have at the moment (from discord)
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 struct: Does brutaltester run the 2 bots at the same time if the game has simultaneous movements, like CSB?
 eulerscheZahl: i think no but not 100% sure
 struct: Thanks I also thinks it doesnt, by checking cpu usage
 eulerscheZahl: great that we thinks the same
 jacek: is that compliment?
 eulerscheZahl: it's nagging on the 3rd person s :P
 Astrobytes: I read it in Popeye's voice
 VizGhar: Jeez reading that forum... Can you splash some algos u used for Mars3? I don like neither GA nor physics approach 
 eulerscheZahl: if else spaghetti
 VizGhar: I see...&#160;:)
 sebak: Hi
 sudhanshu196r: hii
 coolcoder23: hi
 Skynse: hi
 laPetiteGrenouille: hi
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 jrke: flood of hi
 jrke: i thought its indian channel but later discovered its world channel lol
 LazyHacker: hi coders
 jacek: what a noob, draw by repetition <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Xl3f1Jr.png">https://i.imgur.com/Xl3f1Jr.png</a>
 jacek: oh maybe not a noob, he won first game and needed only draw&#160;:\
 reCurse: That's not what I see on the picture
 jacek: so he really isa noob. phew
 AntiSquid: phew? was that your new year's resolution?

 Aina: hi
 zhoubou: Hi
 jacek: c-c-c-combo breaker
 zhoubou: Any tips on optimizing Roller Coaster? I got through all but the last test case.
 Salted: They want you to come up with a formula instead of loops
 Salted: It's annoying
 zhoubou: Ohh I see
 zhoubou: I'm not really a formula person, but I'll try I guess
 Salted: I tried to hard to optimize it in c++ so it would run fast enough but it never would. 
 zhoubou: Yeah, it takes several minutes to run for me in Python
 Salted: I'm not much of a formula person either. That one is tricky like that
 zhoubou: Lol I don't know how to start building a formula in the first place
 VizGhar: read forum&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Oh, I forgot about forum
 zhoubou: They seem to be using memoization instead of formula?
 VizGhar: memoization was the key
 zhoubou: I tried optimizing on group (of riders) loops, but it seems there is something wrong with how I recognize a group loop.
 zhoubou: As in cyclic graph
 zhoubou: I got it. Now it just outputs the wrong number lol. Accuracy: 0.9999247234449352 
 VizGhar: just move cursor properly... How did you get decimals in this puzzle? :O
 zhoubou: I divided expected result by my result
 zhoubou: Manually
 zhoubou: How am I going to debug this behemoth.. Hmm
 zhoubou: Thanks for suggestions btw&#160;:)
 zhoubou: I'm really close
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: Forum is really helpful
 zhoubou: Yeah, it is. I always check it usually. For some reason, I avoided it this time.
 zhoubou: I mean forgot about it completely.
 struct: If you dont want to optimize it
 struct: brute force works in js
 struct: But not on some languages
 VizGhar: for roller coaster? :O
 struct: Same code c++ vs js
 zhoubou: Brute force?
 struct: js passes
 zhoubou: That sounds insane
 struct: But js takes around 4sec+ for last test case
 struct: but c++ timesout way before that
 VizGhar: idk man... without memoization o.O I'll try to solve it in JS and look at your solution
 struct: VizGhar I can just share it if you solved it in other language
 VizGhar: please share. I've solved it (can't wait for f**** clojure)
 struct: Execution time: 5802ms89744892565569
 struct: 5.8 sec
 struct: lol
 VizGhar: :D
 VizGhar: you lucky one
 struct: In c++ you have &lt;500ms to solve it
 jacek: AutomatonNN where are you
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by that?
 zhoubou: AutomatonNN debug my code
 AutomatonNN: person was a bit confused by using an external :P
 zhoubou: Oh yeah, thanks
 struct: Anyone that uses imgui knows if there is any documentation like this but for c++? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://mbm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imgui.html#listboxheader">https://mbm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/imgui.html#listboxheader</a>
 zhoubou: I DID IT
 struct: nice
 zhoubou: :D
 zhoubou: My first hard puzzle
 Blobi: im to stupid to add speed to my pod 
 Blobi: XD
 zhoubou: No memoization required
 CyrusTheCurator: CoC is so addicting
 Lobster_Speed: bruh
 Lobster_Speed: that is only if your good at it 
 jacek: oO
 CyrusTheCurator: being good at it doesn't seem to make a job appear out of thin air tho
 CyrusTheCurator:&#160;:((((
 NeoXX: sup
 leojean890: 34 days remaining for sandbox improvement.. It's a lot for RAIC tryharders to get last prizes :P
 NeoXX: HENLOOOOOOOOO
 NeoXX: WASSUP
 Matryzas: yo
 timoru: is the site slow for anyone else&#160;?
 Matryzas: for me same
 JoeMyers: yep
 Matryzas: they usually reboot servers at this time i guess
 Andrew_OHara: Anyone done the horse-racing duals? I'm not sure what approach to take for the last one
 mechaman: so addicting... just found this site and love it&#160;:) 
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: Clash of code da best
 zadobyte: dam
 Crying_Waffle: anyone here play csgo?
 Crying_Waffle: faceit?
 pipebits: :u
 Crying_Waffle: yall gay for not playing csgo

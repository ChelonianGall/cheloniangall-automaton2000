 cegprakash: for my company to appear in the leaderboard what is the minimum no. of participants needed? I wish my company to be in the leaderboard during spring challenge. I've even asked them to give me less work because I'm representing my company for this contest :P 
 MadKnight: u got a company now cegprakash&#160;?
 cegprakash: I work in 1
 LelouchVC2: Rumor has it that when you reach rank 1, you become Bill Gates
 LoGos: well well I found a bug in my bandas bot that reached 10th place. Can I now call it a feature?
 LelouchVC2: Now you call it a design concept
 LoGos: :ok_hand:
 darkhorse64: Does it get higher now that you have fixed the bug. If not, it's a feature
 LoGos: I'm testing it right now. The bug was bad I think. In my MCTS in UCT formula instead of parent's number of visits I used current best child's number of visits
 LoGos: I'm suprised it worked
 LelouchVC2: That's me when my code barely passes any clash tests, i submit, and i get 100% score
 braincoder2: how to change the thrust in coders strike back?
 LoGos: What league?
 LoGos: in silver you just change third value that you print
 LoGos: between 0 and 100. That's the thrust
 wlesavo: lol, new contribution based on MSmits homework
 LoGos: may I have the link?
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/501591553806c109ea7a0c936bc6f99d0a4a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/501591553806c109ea7a0c936bc6f99d0a4a</a>
 LoGos: thanks
 Arnav-S: I am 1st in Wood 1 League Bot Programming, why am i not getting promoted
 struct: you need to wait until submit completes
 Arnav-S: ok thanks
 Arnav-S: I though it was completed
 Arnav-S: But it wasn't
 Howdareu: i need help
 Howdareu: am stuck on silver
 Howdareu: on coders strike back
 Howdareu: if u know c# please help

 TrentT: Howdareu, is using the shield needed? How are the results without?
 Howdareu: depends what i change the thrust to
 Howdareu: i have put the thrust on 50
 Howdareu: it makes wide turns
 Howdareu: if i make it lower
 Howdareu: i worry that it will be too slow
 AntiSquid: hey Howdareu i like your username
 Howdareu: thnx
 TrentT: You can have create a list of checkpoints and after you have finished the first lap
 TrentT: When the distance to the next checkpoint is less than X, you can start moving towards the next checkpoint.
 Howdareu: ok
 Howdareu: thnx
 toby666999: I have a questionHow to pass the security check of CLASH OF CODE?
 vivax3794: just complete the captcha?
 toby666999: what captcha?
 toby666999: I can only see the prompt to complete the security check
 toby666999: not captcha
 vivax3794: there should be a captcha, like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/638617938047270928/706272604360671232/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/638617938047270928/706272604360671232/unknown.png</a>
 Uljahn: google captcha is blocked in china i guess
 Uljahn: workaround is to use some vpn service
 eulerscheZahl: or play less chashes
 eulerscheZahl: clashes
 reCurse: euler how long does it take you to write a multi on average?
 eulerscheZahl: basic logic can be done on an afternoon for a simple game like onitama
 eulerscheZahl: the UI is the hard work
 reCurse: Did you try using pixi directly
 eulerscheZahl: so as a total: 1 week for onitama (beside my daily job)
 eulerscheZahl: not on the CG platform
 reCurse: Ok
 reCurse: What's the turn/time limit again?
 eulerscheZahl: 30s for the total game (all players)
 eulerscheZahl: and min. 50ms/turn
 eulerscheZahl: thus 600 turns in total
 reCurse: For all players
 eulerscheZahl: that is actions. you can add empty frames or have frames with several players doing something
 eulerscheZahl: 300 actions per player in 1 vs 1
 reCurse: Ok
 Uljahn: im sick of clash invite spam already, btw the thread seems to be relevant although it doesn't look so, pls rate<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/feature-request-ability-to-reject-incoming-follow/58429/4">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/feature-request-ability-to-reject-incoming-follow/58429/4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i did already
 Astrobytes: Same
 Uljahn: thx
 eulerscheZahl: great to see you back after 3 years of absence
 Astrobytes: Beat me to it&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i hate codechef
 Uljahn: i had nothing to say :smirk:
 Astrobytes: Hate something specific on codechef or just codechef in general?
 reCurse: meanwhile I hate clashers
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/cmQ54Wp">https://imgur.com/a/cmQ54Wp</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the last are supposed to be the hardest
 Uljahn: yep, clashers are evil with their clash links in the chat
 eulerscheZahl: but it seems there are just less testcases for the hard one. and a constant is killing me, not complexity for larger numbers
 eulerscheZahl: i even submitted in C++
 Astrobytes: Use D
 cegprakash: I can stream during spring challenge if you guys wish
 cegprakash: if you wish do a slash flip on chat
 eulerscheZahl: go there <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/472807181163429890">https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/472807181163429890</a>
 Astrobytes: A stream where cegprakash asks us what the rules are for 2 hours :D
 eulerscheZahl: btw did you lose interest on topcoder cegprakash?
 cegprakash: no why
 cegprakash: that marathon was tough
 eulerscheZahl: codechef even supports D :tada:
 cegprakash: i read in forum squaring distance could have given better results
 eulerscheZahl: you said even a stupid algo can find good results in the 10s given
 cegprakash: send proper discord invite link eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: I don't have access to that channel
 BenjaminUrquhart: I do tho
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's a publci channel
 cegprakash: wittyprakash#3571 this is my discord id
 eulerscheZahl: then join it
 eulerscheZahl: "join us on dicord"
 eulerscheZahl: above the chat
 cegprakash: I already have discord
 cegprakash: so that link won't work for me
 BenjaminUrquhart: did you join the discord server though
 eulerscheZahl: it's the CG discord server, join itthen go to the streaming channel
 aCat: it will it's an invite link
 cegprakash: what is server ID
 eulerscheZahl: do you see the yellow text above the chat?
 BenjaminUrquhart: click the big join us butto nabove web chat
 cegprakash: I want a link like&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/hTKzmak">https://discord.gg/hTKzmak</a>

 BenjaminUrquhart: bruh
 cegprakash: got in
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: now locate the streaming channel
 eulerscheZahl: and announce your stream there
 eulerscheZahl: use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.timeanddate.com/">https://www.timeanddate.com/</a> for the time
 eulerscheZahl: and date
 Uljahn: i think streams past bronze shouldn't be allowed during contests :unamused:
 Uljahn: sharing the code is forbidden but streams are not, sad
 eulerscheZahl: i have no opinion on them
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't watch as i usually consider it boring
 reCurse: Like someone would bother with the trouble of retyping the code shown on stream lol
 AntiSquid: you can skip through it and get the solution / idea very quickly
 reCurse: So forbid chat during contest? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: you don't need to retype it ... especially not exactly as it is
 AntiSquid: and what if someone does retype? i don't see how that's more of an issue 
 AntiSquid: few ideas scattered here and there in the chat doesn't give away an entire bot though and streaming top 100 bot for the current leaderboard is just annoying for the participants
 reCurse: Well if you're going to compare at least compare right
 reCurse: Anyone in top 100 could exactly tell what he's doing
 reCurse: That's just as "damaging"
 MSmits: it is, so don't&#160;:)
 reCurse: Whether it's stream or chat makes no difference in content
 MSmits: it makes a bit of difference if it is an official CG stream
 reCurse: It is the official CG chat
 MSmits: you dont want them to encourage it
 MSmits: yes, but it's open
 MSmits: it's not the same as putting 1 or 2 players up on a stream
 reCurse: Were we even talking about official CG stream though?
 MSmits: no idea
 aCat: top top people usually do not stream at all - they are too busy with real coding
 aCat: and ideas are nice to spread around
 MSmits: usually
 AntiSquid: whether you might consider top 100 little or no effort, the stream gives away too much if it shows how to make a bot to get there
 aCat: you remember someone who did?
 MSmits: I think they should show how to get out of wood, but nothing beyond that ofc
 AntiSquid: either it's a contest or a learning experience where you share all the way
 reCurse: I'm willing to bet money it won't make it happen
 AntiSquid: Acat well i think there was 1 or 2 legend streams, no idea how much of the actual bot was shared though
 aCat: hmm, I sadly missed them then&#160;:(
 MSmits: I would really prefer if they did do a good stream though, for my students, if I get any joining that is
 MSmits: the game might be too hard for them otherwise
 MSmits: just to give them the experience of getting out of wood and experiment from then on
 AntiSquid: "if they did"
 AntiSquid: MSmits imo just direct your students to thibpat who does a simple if-else bot from what i could see
 MSmits: never saw his streams. Does he speak clearly?
 struct: oh prizes announced
 aCat: thibpat is ok
 AntiSquid: he posts the links on discord MSmits
 MSmits: ah
 struct: He speaks clearly yes
 MSmits: cool
 struct: he is french, but his english is good
 AntiSquid: i think he is clear enough and don't think your kids will have difficulties understanding a french accent
 aCat: had some lacks in bot-programming knowledge
 MSmits: thats nice
 MSmits: some contests though, are really hard to write if else bots for
 AntiSquid: wait acat, what do yo umean by that?
 AntiSquid: didn't he rank higher? why do you say he is lacking :p
 darkhorse64: He wrote a top 100 OOC bot
 aCat: I mean he does things with simple methods which is great
 MSmits: thats pretty good
 aCat: eee?
 AntiSquid: oh nvm, he ranked lower than you aCat, sorry, my bad, but he still did quite well
 aCat: ooc top 100?
 aCat: lower than me
 darkhorse64: lemme check
 AntiSquid: probably top 100 gold&#160;?
 aCat: that's actually new codingame grading scale
 aCat:&#160;;(
 AntiSquid: overall 169
 aCat: lower than acat, higher than acat
 MSmits: tracking the opponent in ooc is not basic coding, even top gold needed some tracking
 AntiSquid: acat 119
 aCat:&#160;;(;(
 MSmits: simple if else is not enough
 AntiSquid: even bottom wood needed some trackig you mean
 MSmits: heh yeah, i guess so
 aCat: ok - you will learn something about game and coding
 aCat: bot not about algos
 MSmits: i dont mind that for my students
 aCat: mm, evo, mects etc
 MSmits: most won't even be able to do oop 
 aCat: he is not into that
 AntiSquid: i got out of wood before the nerf, that was the most ridiculously strong wood boss so far :D
 darkhorse64: I did not attend his streams, only Illedan's
 aCat: in other cases he is nice as he is very communicative
 AntiSquid: wanted to do a quick submit to see full rules, but didn't happen ...
 aCat: I attend a few and put my input on a few things
 MSmits: is evo = ga?
 MSmits: acat?
 aCat: yeah
 MSmits: ah ok
 aCat: I mean evolutionary algorithms is like a more general domain than genetic algorithms
 MSmits: btw if anyone cared. I stopped stc for now, bitboard approach was too slow and needs a rewrite. I am doing PR1 now
 aCat: and what people here use is mostly formally close to rolling horizon evolution (RHEA)
 aCat: :P
 reCurse: I kind of want to do a proper sequel to stc
 aCat: oh PR1 i wanted to try some day
 aCat: still sad PR2 is not in league mode yet
 IAmNoob: anyone knows wahts about this new pacman
 IAmNoob: thingy
 AntiSquid: it's a contest and good morning 
 AntiSquid: :D
 MSmits: pr1 has some haters, but it's mostly because competitively it is a bad game. But just to code a bot for, it is not that bad
 MSmits: kinda fun imho
 IAmNoob: i knew antisqiud
 IAmNoob: but how it will be played
 reCurse: PR2 is the only good PR
 aCat: So i will be interested in your insights Smits some day&#160;;-)
 aCat: reCurse so it's not in league
 reCurse: So what
 AntiSquid: you want to know all the details before contest starts IAmNoob&#160;? 99% of the participants won't know until it starts, i can bet on that :p
 MSmits: reCurse I knew that you felt that way, and I probably will find PR2 to be better also. But I want a legend bot in both&#160;:)
 aCat: *so why 
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: thx
 IAmNoob: you are the 1%?
 AntiSquid: no
 IAmNoob: ok
 reCurse: Will be hard to be legend in no league multi
 AntiSquid: i can only guess what the game is, just like everyone else ...
 MSmits: true
 IAmNoob: yeah
 MSmits: legend PR1, top 100 pr2
 MSmits: or better in pr-2 if i see more potential
 reCurse: It's not bitboard friendly though
 reCurse: You should do something else
 MSmits: lol, maybe I like the fact that i can't do bitboards on this.
 reCurse: Masochism? :o
 MSmits: it's mostly that I won;t be thinking all day: "what if i bitboarded this? "
 IAmNoob: is it possible to derank
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 JBM: what's derank
 IAmNoob: from 9 to 8
 IAmNoob: sooori mai inglisch
 aCat: no it's not
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: thx
 MSmits: also, right before a contest, it is good to brush up on some C# oop... I might need it. All this high-performance bitboard stuff on board games doesnt exactly make you any good in a real contest
 JBM: what does "moving from 9 to 8" mean?
 IAmNoob: bruh
 JBM: bruh
 reCurse: Really? It helped me in coif
 MSmits: yes, that exception crossed my mind
 AntiSquid: IAmNoob ignore these low level no-avatar people 
 pmor: I contemplated using bitboards for OOC...did you see much benefit from using them?
 MSmits: but generally it doesnt help
 IAmNoob: ok
 AntiSquid: you can derank, but you can't get demoted to lower league
 MSmits: well i guess it helped in ooc also
 AntiSquid: does that make sense?
 MSmits: point is, i dont need more bitboard practice right now :P
 IAmNoob: 75%
 IAmNoob: but this one
 reCurse: I thought you saw that less as practice and more as a way of life
 IAmNoob: is level 45
 IAmNoob: 43*
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: true
 AntiSquid: IAmNoob it was a joke @_@ 
 IAmNoob: ok:)
 IAmNoob: how you type red?
 MSmits: like this IAmNoob
 AntiSquid: will have to add #joke next time&#160;??
 JBM: you need a higher level IAmNoob
 MSmits: yes IAmNoob
 IAmNoob: ok ok ok ok
 <b>**jacek hmm?</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: IAmNoob
 MSmits: type your own name
 jacek: YesYouAre
 IAmNoob: MSmits
 JBM: be narcissistic IAmNoob
 MSmits: thats my name
 MSmits: now type your own
 IAmNoob: IAmNoob&#160;:)))
 MSmits: what color is it
 AntiSquid: but it won't show up in red .
 IAmNoob: white
 MSmits: it wont&#160;?
 MSmits: damn
 MSmits: well that's confusing him more then
 AntiSquid: someone else needs to mention you
 IAmNoob: You guys are such a troll
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: it wasn't a troll
 JBM: i thought that was you
 IAmNoob: #joke
 MSmits: IAmNoob, we hope you guessed by now that everyone who mentiones your name shows their text in red
 MSmits: mentions
 IAmNoob: i got it
 MSmits: kk
 IAmNoob: thx
 MSmits: anyone other questions we can troll you about?
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 MSmits: will you be in the contest?
 IAmNoob: yes
 MSmits: thats cool
 IAmNoob: i'll try
 MSmits: oh btw. I won't be on chat much, but do PM me if there's any student of mine misbehaving or something
 MSmits: or my colleague. I will slap him too
 MSmits: :P
 IAmNoob: :P
 MSmits: usually during contest I try to stay off chat during first 5 days
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: weird
 MSmits: i need a lot of time to get a good bot going
 MSmits: so i have no time to chat
 AntiSquid: and about saturday night, latest, you can see him in chat spamming paragraphs of ideas IAmNoob
 MSmits: this is true
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 MSmits: the second saturday :P
 MSmits: well i guess in ooc i shared a bit more. I knew I wasn't going to be top 10 there anyway
 MSmits: and didnt have any special tricks to keep hidden
 reCurse: But think of all the people you undeservedly gave legend
 MSmits: if they got it, they deserved it. That gold boss was hard
 AntiSquid: lol ^ 
 AntiSquid: way besides the point
 MSmits: when i was doing XR, I didn't share anything. I think at most I said I was using bitboards 
 MSmits: ow right, another contest with bitboards =/
 IAmNoob: i think it will be hard
 IAmNoob: tha pac-man bot
 MSmits: I have no idea
 IAmNoob: with all the phantoms
 IAmNoob: ghosts*
 MSmits: the art usually tells you very little about what the game will be
 IAmNoob: and the fruit eating
 IAmNoob: no art
 IAmNoob: i think at pac-man
 MSmits: it could be a game like streetfighter with pacmans instead of  Ken and Ryu
 IAmNoob: not at poster
 reCurse: Is there seriously any doubt it's not pac man at this point?
 AntiSquid: depends MSmits, think about xr kind of a dead giveaway
 MSmits: what do you mean AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: the hint was too strong 
 reCurse: Besides didn't someone find the "secret" playground of pacman? Probably based off that too
 AntiSquid: well in pacman it should be even more obvious
 reCurse: Too bad I forgot the rules
 AntiSquid: well more like it stayed online for 2 years or so
 AntiSquid: only zarthaxx submitted there :D
 MSmits: who made that
 AntiSquid: CG
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: if it is pacman derived, there will probably be lots of BFS
 MSmits: like kutulu
 AntiSquid: ya 
 IAmNoob: yeah
 IAmNoob: Graph theory
 MSmits: I wouldn't represent pacman maze as a graph though
 MSmits: unless it is really sparse
 IAmNoob: yeah
 IAmNoob: we'll se
 struct: I played a bit of last pac mans just to see what changed
 struct: and game has a lot of different stuff
 MSmits: what did it have?
 struct: jumps
 IAmNoob: i havent play pac-man since 1000 years
 reCurse: There's looparound in pacman :upside_down:
 AntiSquid: do you mean pacman 2&#160;?
 AntiSquid: struct
 struct: Bombs that take you to start
 IAmNoob: i think the contest will be about the old pacman
 struct: It was the onje free on steam 
 AntiSquid: ghost trains! 
 struct: yeah
 AntiSquid: it's still free until 10th of may afaik
 AntiSquid: it has some velocity element also
 MSmits: physics?
 struct: The game just keeps getting faster
 MSmits: oh ok
 IAmNoob: thats a thing
 AntiSquid: well not just that, if you go in a straight line you keep accelerating
 MSmits: how would that work in a turnbased game though
 AntiSquid: well if they do it like RAIC ...
 MSmits: no idea... raic seemed messy is all i knew
 IAmNoob: if there will be in the contst like antisquid says it will be hard
 struct: cg wants to be begginer friendly
 MSmits: I just saw games euler posted where he was mowing people down
 reCurse: Statement comes with a frame data table
 AntiSquid: well 3 more days so w/e
 rmuskovets: csb is such an interesting challenge...
 reCurse: inb4 people raging
 IAmNoob: yeah
 MSmits: oh it is interesting. I just like other games more&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: is there not an option to deselect to auto-opening chat of a clash code?
 reCurse: Oh wow they created new notifications to make clash invites even more obnoxious
 reCurse: Thanks CG I hate it
 AntiSquid: add ?disableChat at the end of your URL IAmNoob
 IAmNoob: ok thx

 LoGos: Hi!I want to practica GA. Which puzzle/contest would you recommend? 
 darkhorse64: Mars Lander
 aCat: Ash vs Zombies is simpler
 LoGos: Code vs Zombies?
 LoGos: I dont think I am in mood to implement physics for mars lander 
 darkhorse64: 10 lines of code for me
 aCat: its also optim puzzle - engine is really simple
 LoGos: if you say so
 LoGos: aren't there collisions with rotations?
 LoGos: Never actually tried it
 darkhorse64: My engine: 
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e0a07f00-5006-40fc-9915-9a705a63305d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e0a07f00-5006-40fc-9915-9a705a63305d</a>
 aCat: darkhorse64&#160;:*
 aCat: physics is my issue ;p
 LoGos: :kissing: thanks
 darkhorse64: You probably will find it on the forum too
 darkhorse64: That's the easiest part
 LoGos: I remember why I didn't do it before.How does physics work in these games? Is each turn a single frame? If so how what is a time between these frames?
 eulerscheZahl: the code vs zombies engine is a nightmare
 MSmits: dt = 1
 MSmits: vx = dx
 MSmits: ax = dvx
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't save the input to reproduce it. but i managed to be on the same Y coordinate as the zombie (ash being the closest target). yet the zombie went 1 down as well, not only to the side
 LoGos: MSmits thanks
 LoGos: darkhorse64 you too
 MSmits: np, for more details, look at the csb referee
 MSmits: especially the collisons can be complicated
 darkhorse64: One fair advice: start with Mars Lander 1 because it's one dimensional. It can be solved with a one liner but you can also try a GA on it
 eulerscheZahl: while True: print("0 3\n0 4")
 AntiSquid: is there cvz referee?
 reCurse: Invalid output :P
 reCurse: Didn't you leak that one too?
 eulerscheZahl: then 3 0\n4 0?
 reCurse: 2 \n
 AntiSquid: no idea
 struct: \n
 eulerscheZahl: no AntiSquid, you forgot to leak that one
 reCurse: Half-dick move
 AntiSquid: hm not sure i ever had it, not all refs were available
 darkhorse64: My one liner is a bit longer
 darkhorse64: but works
 AntiSquid: hey if you have it share it instead of calling me a dick
 reCurse: I tend to respect agreements :P
 reCurse: Sorry
 eulerscheZahl: reCurse respects CG
 eulerscheZahl: and is a fast typist
 struct: How did the leak even happened?
 struct: Is this fine to ask?
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid got the referees for BotG
 eulerscheZahl: in the preparation
 reCurse: During CCs CG shared a bunch of referees to authors
 reCurse: The first thing we asked during MM is if we can make them public
 AntiSquid: folder of stuff shared on slack
 reCurse: They said no please don't
 reCurse: Then AntiSquid did it anyway
 reCurse: End of story
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 AntiSquid: they never said that to us
 reCurse: I guess it's the old "easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission"
 AntiSquid: also not sure if it wasn't posted in main chat or just the team chat, if it was in main slack chat then about 50 people should have it and they kept it only for themselves
 reCurse: I wasn't on that slack, there was one dedicated for MM
 reCurse: Anyway we asked and got denied
 reCurse: So I'm not sharing anything because of that
 reCurse: Not because "I keep it to myself"
 reCurse: And yes cvz is in there
 AntiSquid: ya but my team was after yours, anyways no idea how many people got it
 MSmits: it's normal now to have a referee for each contest anyway
 reCurse: We made the same argument
 eulerscheZahl: but that doesn't make old referees public domain
 cegprakash: hey
 struct: I think its just a matter of respect
 cegprakash: I plan to test streaming using clash of code
 AntiSquid: from memory i am quite sure i shared everything apart from some puzzle referees (shadow of the knight&#160;? and such)
 MSmits: of course eulerscheZahl, I don't mean it's right to leak, I just mean I am not sorry it got leaked
 cegprakash: once the washing machine in my room finishes I'll start the stream
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 eulerscheZahl: didn't you want to stream the contest?
 cegprakash: yes
 eulerscheZahl: it hasn't started yet
 AntiSquid: if i don't share i am a dick, because i shared i did something wrong, well can't win eh&#160;?
 cegprakash: clash of code is for testing purposes
 cegprakash: before the stream
 Astrobytes: Can't you just sing a song or something instead of CoC cegprakash?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: can you invite AntiSquid while streaming?
 cegprakash: lol
 struct: who would say that uyou are a dick for not  sharing?
 reCurse: No one
 MSmits: I got a good song cegprakash
 cegprakash: I can play some nice music
 Astrobytes: Here goes Aladdin aagain
 MSmits: :P
 AntiSquid: i was told it's half dick move for not sharing something i have no idea if i even have struct
 reCurse: You understood it the wrong way around
 MSmits: is half dick even a real insult?
 reCurse: The full move would have been to share everything
 AntiSquid: ya ok, did anyone else share it?
 reCurse: My mistake is I thought you had the same archive
 reCurse: But guess not
 AntiSquid: it's not about the insult, it's about what is implied MSmits
 MSmits: ahhh
 MSmits: size matters?
 reCurse: Always
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: then a low compression rate format such as zip is better than 7z?
 MSmits: dont worry about it AntiSquid... it's history now isnt it, isnt this years ago?
 cegprakash: starting now
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://twitch.tv/cegprakash">http://twitch.tv/cegprakash</a>
 reCurse: Depends if you're golfing or not
 MSmits: Celine Dion is ok too
 AntiSquid: MSmits i just asked if there was a cvz referee, that's all, the past wasn't brought up by me
 reCurse: No it's not and never has been :p
 HDviews: can't get past loops
 HDviews: fuck es tis
 AntiSquid: apparently there is and i can't find it MSmits
 MSmits: hmm let me see
 struct: cegprakash we can see yes
 AntiSquid: well whatever, the test cases are up so, that's better probably&#160;?
 struct: The only "hard" part is the movement imo
 struct: rest is trivial
 Astrobytes: omg he's playing CEline Dion
 Astrobytes: We hear you cegprakash!
 struct: 3 hours titanic
 AntiSquid: cegprakash play panjabi heavy metal or something similar 
 MSmits: AntiSquid I found a bunch of referees, but no zombies
 eulerscheZahl: that's a boring clash problem
 MSmits: cegprakash when are you going to sing the titanic song. The mustic has been going on for a while now
 MSmits: music
 foxbel: hello guys
 reCurse: Or do the flute version
 foxbel: go maincraft
 AntiSquid: mein craft&#160;?
 MSmits: lol
 reCurse: oh boy
 foxbel:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: is that all free music or will we see a kick from twitch soon?
 Astrobytes: GoT OST.... not sure that's PD
 AntiSquid: there is no kick for that afaik
 AntiSquid: you just get your audio muted for the recorded video
 AntiSquid: or parts of the audio
 reCurse: Pretty much
 reCurse: So doesn't matter if you keep your VOD locally
 reCurse: To upload on youtube
 eulerscheZahl: and he's not firm of the python syntax
 eulerscheZahl: "n1 and n2 have the same number of digits"
 eulerscheZahl: ceg not reading the statement once again :D
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 struct: ha
 AntiSquid: copy paste statement in chat&#160;?
 AntiSquid: bit by bit, see what happens
 struct: I still remembe this clash
 struct: this is sub 15s clash for sure
 eulerscheZahl: you are mean struct
 eulerscheZahl: saying that 7min into the clash
 struct: I mean after 3k clashes or something
 struct: Your mind just triggers when you see the answer
 struct: I would only see the first 1 or 2 test cases and know the answer if I had done it before
 AntiSquid: a | b&#160;? 
 struct: There were many repeated clashes tat that time
 struct: yes antiqsuid
 eulerscheZahl: and now he codes an XOR?
 eulerscheZahl: read the statement. saves so much trouble
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm well entertained
 AntiSquid: he should stop recording the chat&#160;:/
 LelouchVC2: Statement: Code 3 people walking into a nigerian prince's home.
 cegprakash: was I any good?
 struct: Did he end it?
 struct:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: the audio is very poor cegprakash, the music is too loud
 eulerscheZahl: already over&#160;:(
 cegprakash: that's what I was asking
 AntiSquid: also most streamers don't record chat
 eulerscheZahl: helps me to understand your way of thinking and the questions you ask on chat
 Astrobytes: You asked if we could hear you :P
 cegprakash: if I reduce video volume it should be fine I guess
 Astrobytes: But yeah, maybe turn the music down a little bit more
 eulerscheZahl: i agree, music is as loud as you are. i find it distracting
 AntiSquid: do you need the music cegprakash&#160;?
 AntiSquid: maybe speak louder if you have music?
 cegprakash: will reduce music during actual stream
 cegprakash: just have to reduce volume on youtube
 Astrobytes: I could hear ceg just fine, just the music was a bit much
 AntiSquid: well the music was as loud as he was
 eulerscheZahl: i tend to rage-quit when there is music
 cegprakash: I was loud as well?
 Astrobytes: You were loud enough is what I mean
 cegprakash: I need some good music during stream
 Astrobytes: The music should be lower compared to your voice
 AntiSquid: ^
 Uljahn: keyboard and mouse clicks were loud too
 Uljahn: also looks like audio bitrate was low or comression was too high
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: don't know how to fix that I already reduced noise from my end
 AntiSquid: just do more clashes, record them all and only play recordings that you find good? :p
 AntiSquid: or stream a puzzle so you can talk about it and have time to read statement&#160;?
 Uljahn: large noise reduction could screw audio too
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine if i can hear typing
 cegprakash: yeah I type loud and I use the mic in my laptop
 cegprakash: don't know how to remove keyboard noice and mouse clicks
 cegprakash: *noise
 Uljahn: probably impossible in this setup
 Astrobytes: Ah it's the laptop mic, you can't do much with that tbh. I don't mind clicks/keyboards 
 Uljahn: yep, me too
 AntiSquid: headset with mic, but personally don't mind the typing
 struct: If your card support RTX
 struct: There is the audio thing
 struct:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: My headphones mic doesn't work that's why I use laptop mic.. I'm rewatching stream now.. it's saved 
 Lopear: Hi
 foxbel: Gitler
 Lopear: Hi
 LelouchVC2: That moment when you thought a shortest code clash was a fastest clash
 eulerscheZahl: did you win by speed?
 LelouchVC2: I submitted first, but only realized it was a short code contest when I processed the message I already okayed xD
 cegprakash: the music was nice till it was titanic during the stream
 cegprakash: when I changed to light of the seven it screwed the stream
 Astrobytes: cegprakash I hope you are not using this as an excuse to stream the Titanic soundtrack :D
 cegprakash: yeah I will use titanic
 cegprakash: or find me such nice cute tracks
 LelouchVC2: Take this moment to stream 70s hit music
 Astrobytes: lol, I can hardly wait :P
 AntiSquid: you can search for royalty free music, people won't know what you like cegprakash
 Astrobytes: Cannibal Corpse, Necrophagist, Bloodbath, all nice, soothing, cute music
 AntiSquid: i do like 80s and 90s 
 cegprakash: I actually have a nice playlist I use to dance in my zumba classes&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaKATBlfRCHbK7IsV8J_6P2odSfXaHsqK">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaKATBlfRCHbK7IsV8J_6P2odSfXaHsqK</a>
 LelouchVC2: I particularly like drowingpool "bodies"
 cegprakash: I can use that
 AntiSquid: you should use your cultural advantage and play panjab cegprakash and try to look a bit happier 
 Astrobytes: Play whatever you want cegprakash, just keep the volume pretty low
 eulerscheZahl: can you play this cegprakash? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkwNS1AsbE0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkwNS1AsbE0</a>
 Quidome: 02:21:42
 Astrobytes: lol
 cegprakash: AntiSquid I turned of fan so I was sweating
 cegprakash: the fan in my room is bit noisy.. 
 cegprakash: yes I'll smile more
 cegprakash: I was too serious with clash of code time constraint
 Astrobytes: Hey, you were laughing sometimes&#160;:)
 cegprakash: Jeez eulerscheZahl I thought someone was knocking the door
 Quidome: Are the rules of the new contest leaked somwhere :P
 cegprakash: I had to pause and resume several times to make sure it's coming from youtube or outside
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: No shirts this time?
 Astrobytes: Are you gonna do Wood -&gt; Bronze or just Wood cegprakash?
 cegprakash: mostly just wood.. I am a slow guy
 struct: I was expecting wood -&gt; 1st
 cegprakash: yes I'll reach 1st though
 AntiSquid: struct maybe it's because of the top 3 schools / companies&#160;?
 Astrobytes: On the last day of the contest&#160;;)
 cegprakash: just that I'll be slow
 cegprakash: can't have a stream that long
 struct: I guess, the personalized glass seems like a nice prize too
 AntiSquid: i find CG is hard to stream while making it entertaining and CG staff always do it in 2, one writes and the other one types
 AntiSquid: i mean one talks the other one types :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: Was juuuust about to pick you up on that :D
 eulerscheZahl: i think i should change my company before the next contest
 Astrobytes: Why?
 eulerscheZahl: no way to reach any rank there without colleagues competing
 AntiSquid: ask for special inscription on the glass if yours wins: "euler carried"
 Insufficient: hey guys in case its of interest i'm teaching myself searches for the first time and fyi Kaggle has a minimax tutorial course within its minicourse: 'Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning'
 LelouchVC2: Thank you for that time relevant information
 AntiSquid: it is 
 Astrobytes: Insufficient, nice one. If you have any search-related questions you can ask on chat here too, lots of experienced people
 Astrobytes: 1st prize - Samsung curved led monitor, I've never used a curved monitor. They any good?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, me answering is like 2 blind talking about the color
 eulerscheZahl: but no tshirts&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: my chances to reach top3 are minimal, while top20 is doable
 Astrobytes: Speaking of colour, I'm colour-blind and your CG-Funge optim hurts my brain
 Astrobytes: I have to put it full screen to be able to read it
 eulerscheZahl: so you can't read this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/AYcndoy.png">https://i.imgur.com/AYcndoy.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, didn't consider that when creating CGFunge&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: me and graphics isn't working well
 Astrobytes: I can just make it out
 Astrobytes: I won't repeat what it says here
 MSmits: I was wondering what a color bund is for a while
 eulerscheZahl: referee is on github, PRs are welcome&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol, I'll put it on my TODO list
 kovi: i have more problem with stack size
 kovi: oh, prizes'
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes what kind of color blind? 
 Astrobytes: red-green
 struct: Is Yavalath fine_
 struct:&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: ouch
 Astrobytes: Yavalath is fine yeah
 LelouchVC2: I had a color blind friend who'd I constantly ask him what color things were
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I used to punch people who did that
 AntiSquid: but but you were a chef&#160;!? i mean i assume you need good eye for presentation
 Astrobytes: I'm colour blind AntiSquid not fucking blind 
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: Everyone in CG was a chef at some point?
 Astrobytes: Not like I was serving purple sauces and shit
 eulerscheZahl: i can cook noodles
 chandanagrawal23: join all
 Astrobytes: Just me and squiddy afaik struct
 AntiSquid: well hard to imagine what the world looks like to a color blind person
 Astrobytes: Same as it does for you
 reCurse: Aren't there color filters simulating that
 eulerscheZahl: easier to imagine than the other way
 Astrobytes: Just differentiating some shades of certain colours is a challenge
 AntiSquid: it's not the same, when you work in an environment where color is important (imo)
 AntiSquid: @reCurse
 Astrobytes: Well, I couldn't be an electrician put it that way&#160;;)
 trace..: fuck your self man......
 AntiSquid: ok then what
 struct:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: he didn't answer in time
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid I never ever had any issues while cheffing
 reCurse: I meant the other way around, to see what it looks like to a color blind person
 reCurse: I think that's how they do accessibility
 Astrobytes: The best test for accessibility (colour wise) is making sure you have colour-blind people on your testing team
 reCurse: Sure but that's not always possible
 Astrobytes: True
 reCurse: Not to mention you need to cover all 3 or 4 of types
 AntiSquid: you might need 2-3 different color palettes&#160;? different color blindness different needs? not sure
 MSmits: I remember playing some soccer game on nintendo, some old fifa game, against a color blind person. Easy win
 Astrobytes: Some forms of colour-blindness literally mean that people can only see in a strict range of colours. I see all colours, it can just be hard to distinguish between them sometimes, or correctly classify them
 AntiSquid: i played console on black and white TV MSmits :D
 MSmits: nice
 reCurse: I think there's post fx to simulate those so you can design accordingly
 eulerscheZahl: there are funny fails with testers not covering all edge cases <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/05/01/apple-watch-tattoos-apple/">https://9to5mac.com/2015/05/01/apple-watch-tattoos-apple/</a>
 LelouchVC2: Yea, he did punch me once
 LelouchVC2: All in good fun &lt;3
 Astrobytes: The search engine company I worked for back in the day got in several rounds of focus-group type testers, for accessibility + useability
 Astrobytes: Was useful.
 Astrobytes: Shame they didn't do that when they first launched the site as the bgcolor was #FF6600
 Astrobytes: Can't find the old version, but that orange up the top here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010927141209/http://2webpages.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20010927141209/http://2webpages.com/</a>
 LelouchVC2: If you use Windows, you can make it so your whole screen outputs with a filter for your color blindess
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2 Unless I'm trying to guess a colour it doesn't bother me enough to need a filter&#160;;)
 TheCaptainTraveller_d2b8: Im Not an expert at code :disappointed_relieved:
 LelouchVC2: Neither is captain america
 MSmits: lol, my first submission in PR-1 and I'm at least getting to silver
 MSmits: is it supposed to be this easy?
 LoGos: PR?
 Jasperr: Platinum Rift
 LoGos: thx
 AntiSquid: public reputation
 MSmits: seems like a fun game to me
 Astrobytes: Pull request
 MSmits: lots of games vs Zarthax
 Astrobytes: Thought you were doing STC MSmits?
 MSmits: I timed my bitboard implementation with floodfill and it sucked
 MSmits: so have to rewrite it
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 MSmits: I preferred to do something that helps me with next contest
 MSmits: doing some C#... I practice too little
 Astrobytes: Without bitboards?
 MSmits: yeah, the PR games have no use for that
 MSmits: also I am very inexperienced with multi-agent games
 xDDD: why the descent is so easy?
 Astrobytes: wrt your STC rewrite I meant
 MSmits: oh
 Astrobytes: Or just more efficient floodfill
 MSmits: well I'll use a bitboard for somewhat quicker BFS (to store visited cells), but not for the board itself
 MSmits: i'll use int8_t 
 MSmits: like struct said
 LelouchVC2: I feel like I deserve a trophy every time I beat a python coder
 Astrobytes: Yep. Makes more sense to me for STC
 MSmits: haha, just learn python
 MSmits: i did it pretty quickly, so can you
 Astrobytes: BB seems like overkill
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3 thanks. I'll get to it over the summer when my classes are over&#160;;-;
 MSmits: well it would have been worth it if the floodfill was fast, but I'm starting to think BB floodfill just sucks in most cases
 Astrobytes: You can do it LelouchVC2
 LelouchVC2: I'll do it for you daddy&#160;:))
 Astrobytes: If you can do a fast BB BFS you can do a fast BB floodfill surely MSmits
 MSmits: LelouchVC2, the way i did it was i had 30 unsolved easy puzzles over the last summer and I just did them all while I was on vacation, in python
 MSmits: no, i dont mean like that Astrobytes
 MSmits: i mean parallel floodfill
 Astrobytes: Ah gotcha
 MSmits: shift all columns and rows to flood many cells at once
 LelouchVC2: Oh, that sounds like a nice idea, thanks a lot! I'll do a crash course in a day, then spend the rest solving puzzles with it&#160;:))
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remember
 MSmits: i think the parallel floodfill works great on filling large areas, but it sucks for small ones or long corridors
 Astrobytes: That does seem costly if applied to STC
 MSmits: it should be ok for tron 
 MSmits: depending on the situation on the board that is
 Astrobytes: Yes, like you were doing for OOC. And would work for Tron - but you're goign to bitboard Tron?!
 Astrobytes: I really don't see the need for that
 MSmits: I already have a bitboard for tron :P
 MSmits: thats what my bot is. Not sure if it sucks because its a bitboard or whatever it is
 Astrobytes: If it can be bitboarded, you will bitboard it
 Astrobytes: I should know by now
 MSmits: I actually did this a long time ago though, I think after kutulu
 MSmits: or right before even
 MSmits: it's my only live minimax on any leaderboard
 MSmits: but it only got gold
 Astrobytes: Fix it 
 MSmits: Platinum Rift - Episode 1
 Astrobytes: What is that game about again?
 MSmits: I'll fix tron eventually
 MSmits: oh, it's a risk game basically
 MSmits: the board game risk
 Astrobytes: Oh right the territory thing
 MSmits: I've never done a game like that
 Astrobytes: I love Risk
 MSmits: I meant a multi agent game, like halite and such
 MSmits: many AI's to control at once
 MSmits: also basically non-searchable
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know what you meant
 MSmits: kk... I love risk too btw
 Astrobytes: Is it fun?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: people who complain about it, complain mostly because at the top the game is more about luck with the start
 MSmits: but that doesn't mean you can't have fun writing a bot to get there
 Astrobytes: Nice. Must do something one day (add to infinite TODO list)
 MSmits: yeah, this is actually a faster bot to write
 Astrobytes: Come to think of it, not played Risk in ages. Last time was in Sweden a few years ago
 MSmits: the thing is that you dont actually have to code the entire game like you would in mean max and fantastic bits
 MSmits: and even if you had to, its fairly simple
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just predict what you have to and no more
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: mmh i wonder how high i will get in silver, i beat bronze at 35.85 vs 31.97
 Astrobytes: Probably about halfway up depending on number of broken bots, it's quite an old multi right?
 MSmits: I am guessing I will get stuck a few places under boss
 MSmits: it's an old multi yeah
 Astrobytes: halfway up+
 MSmits: I dont see broken bots
 MSmits: just bad bots 
 Astrobytes: Oh nice
 Astrobytes: They could be broken tho
 Astrobytes: Language updates make them timeout at certain turns etc
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yeah maybe
 MSmits: just noticed i have timeouts too
 Astrobytes: Missed an edge case?
 MSmits: it happens when I conquered whole continents
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457192808">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457192808</a>
 MSmits: I'm pink
 MSmits: p2
 struct: you mean red  right?
 MSmits: whatever that color is, sure
 AntiSquid: foxtria
 MSmits: that's a color?
 Astrobytes: It's a very pink-y red depending what angle you look at it on my monitor at least :P
 AntiSquid: fuchsia - don't care
 MSmits: there's a lot of discussion about color today
 struct: Yeah, but there is also pink, thats why i got a bit confused 
 AntiSquid: too many weird color names
 MSmits: I just know maybe 10 color names
 MSmits: when people start throwing magenta around, I lose focus
 AntiSquid: really irritating, if you don't get the initial lucky roll ro beat all, then you have to slowly climb the ladder and go around ranks which you beat most of the time
 MSmits: do you mean PR-1 specifically, or just any multi?
 AntiSquid: about any multi with big league
 MSmits: ah yes, that's true
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's a general case for sure
 MSmits: one thing you can do is just make a totally awesome bot. But if you're near your ceiling (for example when you try to beat gold boss), it does suck
 AntiSquid: i don't see the point of hanging around rank 300 when the bot final rank will be around 30, min 50
 Astrobytes: oh an btw - which one's pink? :P
 MSmits: in that replay it is the guy that captured north america 
 MSmits: that was me anyway, i dont understand why it doesnt show player names
 AntiSquid: that's another issue MSmits, you can't compare vs bots in the league above, so it's difficult to guess what improvements are best&#160;:/
 MSmits: oh it shows at the bottom, silly me
 AntiSquid: unless you use cgbench but still
 struct: MSmits im getitng confused
 MSmits: right, that's annoying
 MSmits: what about struct
 struct: For me the one who conquered north america is red
 Astrobytes: Same
 MSmits: yeah i think it is red
 MSmits: but i see it as a dark pink
 Astrobytes: Yeah but who's actual pink
 struct: Karocyt
 MSmits: i see that as a light purple
 struct: player 4
 Astrobytes: Cool, I was right
 MSmits: yeah i suck at colors
 Astrobytes: (testing my colour blindness)
 Astrobytes: Btw, my original question was a Pink Floyd reference
 MSmits: i'm not actually color blind to any degree. I just have extreme disinterest in knowing the right names for colors :P
 AntiSquid: looks carmine to me
 struct: you and your colors 
 struct: :p
 MSmits: yeah AntiSquid, whats up with that
 AntiSquid: i just looked up needlessly complicated color names
 MSmits: oh ok
 Astrobytes: Carmine my ass
 MSmits: you should probably have that looked at
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: might be some weird fetish so not sure about seeing a doctor, unless that's also a fetish
 Astrobytes: No, that colour is most definitely not carmine
 Astrobytes: or cochineal, whatever you wanna call it
 struct: HEX 	#FF1D5CNAME 	-TONE 	vivid red
 MSmits: thats the color of that replay?
 struct: yes for red player
 struct: so you
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: how do you find that?
 MSmits: did you just spend 15 minutes looking at colors?
 struct: inspect elemet
 MSmits: ah that works
 struct: it gives rgb
 Astrobytes: looks like pink if you look at your monitor one way, and redder if you look at another angle
 xDDD: :zzz:
 struct: I guess it also depends on monitor
 MSmits: yeah it might
 struct: Some monitors have higher viewer angles
 struct: So if from the side it wont lose much accuracy 
 Astrobytes: My chair is quite high, monitors tilted back
 Astrobytes: If I lower the chair  I see more red, higher up you see more pink-&gt;purply
 struct: laptop?
 Astrobytes: Depending how close I sit to the desk, which rn is very close due to my back
 Astrobytes: No, dual monitors + PC
 Astrobytes: It's just the angle + distance
 MSmits: yeah looks like i am losing games now. Probably half of silver
 MSmits: good guess
 Astrobytes: usually the case for the older multis, since bosses are usually boosted somewhat
 AntiSquid: it's ok, can't lose them all
 MSmits: Basically I simply coded a bot with a somewhat sensible division of pods over continents that then just go for the nearest unowned platinum zone
 MSmits: super greedy
 MSmits: enough to get from wood2 to silver apparently
 Amrhossam: what does the rank mean, if it's a bigger number is it better or when it is a small number
 Astrobytes: good start anyway!
 struct: small  better
 MSmits: yeah I'm happy
 AntiSquid: it's like on any leaderboard, 1 is at the top Amrhossam
 Amrhossam: what are the chances of me getting hired from this website :D
 Amrhossam: like in a scale from 0 to 10
 AntiSquid: talk to staff directly&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and ask them
 xDDD: how to turn off discord bar
 xDDD:&#160;?
 Amrhossam: i'm not seeking something formal i'm just chatting
 struct: I used ublock
 dbdr: MSmits: multiagent is a subjective definition. you can say PR1 is a single agent, you just have multiple actions per turn
 dbdr: is every card in locam a separate agent?&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: CSB, MeanMax
 AntiSquid: do we have any multi agent then? 
 dbdr: same, single agent, multiple actions
 Astrobytes: Yes I'm agreeing dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: I think a real multiagent if if they can't communicate, or limitedly
 dbdr: like separate physical robots in the real world
 Astrobytes: It's definitely a bit of a confusing term on CG
 dbdr: so I would say CG cannot have multiagent by counstruction
 dbdr: well, calm might be multi agent, and you only control one of them
 dbdr: the other agent is the other player, and you collaborate
 Astrobytes: (theoretically)
 AntiSquid: but it's not your code on the other agent
 dbdr: exactly
 Astrobytes: In practice, there was not a great deal of collaboration
 dbdr: that's what makes it multiagent
 AntiSquid: are you saying that if there are two separate instances of your code run then it's not a  multi agent?
 dbdr: yes, just some. like I would make a pie because it's needed, not necessarily make the whole order
 dbdr: the other might pick it up, or me a piece he prepared
 AntiSquid: say your CSB code would be run for each pod individually and you can only output actions for 1 pod
 Astrobytes: Please don't remind me of that game dbdr :D
 dbdr: two instances of your code could be multiagent if they have limited communication
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: I liked calm&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: well i mean without communication
 dbdr: then yes
 Astrobytes: I liked it a bit, but not a lot.... 
 dbdr: would be interesting
 Astrobytes: Yes, it would be
 Doumaki: "Hello World"
 AntiSquid: wait, it's actually possible on CG
 dbdr: also you could be allowed to communicate N bits per turn
 Doumaki: i v been dying to do that
 dbdr: is it?
 AntiSquid: in an odd way
 AntiSquid: maybe you still wouldn't consider it multi agent&#160;?
 Astrobytes: How so?
 dbdr: well, if it's the same program running, you share the same memory
 dbdr: if your bot is stateful
 AntiSquid: let's say each of your units have their own turn&#160;? they get their own set of inputs regarding the game state
 dbdr: right, but they can communicate using global variables
 dbdr: or local vars of your main()
 dbdr: so that's cheating
 dbdr: the sdk would need to start several instances of your bot, and I don't think it supports that
 Astrobytes: Or you mean, run as a 4 player but still have two of your own bots? I don'#t think that's possible
 dbdr: yes, would need to modify the sdk
 Astrobytes: hmm
 dbdr: not a lot actually, you can already play against yourself
 dbdr: but yeah, scoring would be different
 AntiSquid: think in terms of code a la mode&#160;?
 dbdr: hm, the referee could handle that part
 dbdr: yeah, give the same score to bots of the same player
 AntiSquid: the referee can create 2 instances of the same bot vs 2 instances of the same bot
 dbdr: but the sdk will use 4 players for a 4 player game, not 2x2
 Astrobytes: Oh right, and each instance can have x ID
 dbdr: the referee does not start the bots
 dbdr: the sdk does
 AntiSquid: but in code a la mode you don't keep your globals do you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i forgot
 Astrobytes: No but you also don't have two of your own agents
 dbdr: you do, it was actually a source of bugs
 dbdr: so bots did not reset correctly for their second game
 struct: yeah, there is no restart option on sdk
 Astrobytes: Hmmm
 Amrhossam: who's interested in Computational fluid dynamics 
 Astrobytes: It doesn't seem feasible to me
 Astrobytes: (wrt true multi-agent)
 dbdr: maybe with the referee making you play many games, but most are fake ones :D
 dbdr: too complicated
 dbdr: gotta go, gn
 AntiSquid: gn
 Astrobytes: gn 
 MSmits: gotta go too, gn
 Astrobytes: gn
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: I'm out too, knackered
 Astrobytes: gn
 struct: gn
 AntiSquid: bye
 MadKnight: everyone's gn'ing, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how do i get it
 MadKnight: but is anyone still alive here, Automaton2000&#160;?

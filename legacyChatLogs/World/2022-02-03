 V1kt0rCZ: Hello
 YCSVenom: that's really cool thanks bro
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 dodek: wasup
 Aymend: Hey
 iLikeHoney: there should be a button that leads you directly to the next puzzle without going back to the puzzles list 
 5DN1L: There is no "next" puzzle to speak of. You can choose whatever puzzle you want to solve in whatever order
 iLikeHoney: there is a default order tho. So far I solved the puzzles in the order they were given to me
 5DN1L: What default order?
 iLikeHoney: the tutorial one, the mountains, the thor ragnarok, the temperature
 iLikeHoney: now I m at the mars lander
 5DN1L: That is not a default order... that is just the usual order...
 5DN1L: and even those can be solved in any order
 iLikeHoney: I know, I know
 iLikeHoney: so there is a order :relieved:
 5DN1L: any order isn't an order, but i'll stop here
 iLikeHoney: i was referring to the 'usual order', but I'll stop here too
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 give me an order
 Automaton2000: you can check the forum
 5DN1L: good idea

 One-Six: I think I finally completely understood how Lua's file:read() behaves
 5DN1L: Oh, One-Six, what have you discovered?
 One-Six: I've been using io.read('n') to quickly read a number; but, if after that line of number are lines of input data, and I simply use io.read() again, I always got a empty line first before I got the rest of the data
 5DN1L: ah ok
 One-Six: I overlooked the fact that when reading only a number, Lua will just stop the "cursor" immediately after the end of number, before the newline character
 One-Six: thus resulting in that extra unwanted newline
 5DN1L: but if all the lines contain just numbers, would that still read unwanted newlines?
 One-Six: lemme check
 One-Six: I know Lua is assume the number may have spaces around them, I think it will treat newlines as whitespaces and ignore them if it's all numbers
 5DN1L: yup, i think that's how it works
 One-Six: yep, looks like it
 One-Six: but if I need to read string after numbers, I should've done number=io.read('n','l') to read and discard that extra newline
 One-Six: now, last time I got stumped by this, I tried io.read('nl') in desperation and somehow that worked that one time....??? Now that I tested this in isolation, looks like 'nl' behave exactly like 'n'
 5DN1L: haha interesting
 One-Six: 'nl' isn't legal by the official reference manual anyway though, so I will just assume it's some undocumented quirkiness

 DCVolo: Hi, how do i disable the IDE "local popup help frame"&#160;?
 DCVolo: (the hover thing)
 5DN1L: Not sure what you refer to. What does it say?
 DCVolo: the inner frame from CG IDE that is shown only when i hover my mouse over a function , variable etc
 5DN1L: Look for SETTINGS on the left hand side of the IDE page
 5DN1L: then maybe adjusting the Editor configuration there may help
 DCVolo: it's too often misplaced, instead of being on top of the variable function, it's placed based on the cursor and so most of the time i can't access my code and click on that frame&#160;:/
 DCVolo: already took a look at that, there is nothing about this
 5DN1L: change editor.hover.enabled to False?
 DCVolo: I didnt have that line yet, seems to be working fine, thank you&#160;!&#160;:)

 BadBurger: not that awsome at math, is atan2 what i want if i want to know what angle point2 is to point1?
 BadBurger: or atan2*pi
 BadBurger: no thats not it
 5DN1L: Try testing the function with some pairs of (delta_x, delta_y) to see if it fits your purpose
 5DN1L: note that atan2 outputs radians, not degrees
 Fasader: don't you need 3 points to get an angle?
 5DN1L: i think he means the angle of the direction
 BadBurger: yeah angle of direction
 BadBurger: trying this but.. somethings is off
 BadBurger:     var dx = (ship.x - landing_pad_locations[0][0])
 BadBurger: ah, it didnt pastebin it.
 5DN1L: i think you need at least 5 lines to pastebin
 5DN1L: what's off?
 BadBurger: trying to draw a line on that angle but it misses target. maybe my drawline is off
 BadBurger: this is the code to draw line from mars lander to landingpad, im doing a graphic sim
 BadBurger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09ef8da9-31d0-4c28-96c3-6d2cc4bcd332">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09ef8da9-31d0-4c28-96c3-6d2cc4bcd332</a>
 DaNinja: dx = targetx - shipx
 5DN1L: Why use 3.1415 on one hand and Math.PI on the other hand?
 BadBurger: i changed it to check if its faster
 BadBurger: thx daninja, il try that
 DaNinja: x = cos(a) * r; y = sin(a) * r
 BadBurger: this code, gives me x: -5928y: -920
 BadBurger: and landing pad location = <a href="/index.php?title=4000,_150,_5500,_150&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="4000, 150, 5500, 150 (page does not exist)">4000, 150, 5500, 150</a>

 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 ninjadip: thought your name said electrojoint at first with my terrible eyes
 ninjadip: does anyone hard a hard time knowing when a problem is "naturally recursive"&#160;?
 ninjadip: have a hard time..*
 Wontonimo: like what?
 struct: what is naturally recurisve?
 ninjadip: some video i was watching about when to use recursive functions, it said when the problem is naturally recursive
 ninjadip: something about if the work can be split naturally
 ninjadip: without it looking forced 
 ninjadip: that's when to use recursion vs iteration
 ninjadip: just have a hard time thinking what's naturally recursive
 therealbeef: fractals?
 ninjadip: or when to use a recursive solution vs iteration. as i've only done recursion once or twice as an example in class
 ninjadip: in relation to coding problems therealbeef, not anything
 ninjadip: is there any advice anyone can offer on when to use them? or not
 therealbeef: depth first search
 Astrobytes: I guess if you're using a stack in an iterative process you can use recursion if you have the stack space and time isn't a problem
 ninjadip: recursion doesn't equal more processing time per se
 Astrobytes: I meant in terms of time complexity, sortry
 Astrobytes: *sorry
 BlaiseEbuth: Use recursion when you need to explore parallel possibilities with different evolution of the same initial values. aka a tree
 Astrobytes: I don't think I ever heard the term 'naturally recursive'
 ninjadip: ah
 ninjadip: ty BlaiseEbuth
 ninjadip: that makes sense
 ninjadip: so anything tree like, or with in depth permutations
 ninjadip: Astrobytes time to code should be less if you are using the right one. I had this crazy long iteration function in tic tac toe, now in recursion it's 1/10 of the size
 Astrobytes: time as a function of input size, I mean
 Astrobytes: the recursive code will indeed be shorter, that's another good reason to use it if you have the stack space
 helpmefindaname: is there a way to play a clash again (in a sandbox mode/alone) after you saw it online?
 darkhorse64: something is natural when you don't know how to explain or justify it
 ninjadip: hm
 5DN1L: helpmefindaname Search here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Wontonimo: +1 darkhorse64 
 helpmefindaname: thank you
 darkhorse64: It was the favorite word for one of our "Président de la République". Everytime he said something dubious, it was "natural"
 darkhorse64: he was saying ... Poor English
 ninjadip: sounds more like unnatural lol
 Astrobytes: which one? When I hear 'dubious' I think Sarkozy
 darkhorse64: Chirac
 Astrobytes: lol, not much better
 jacek: oh my <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/nsuxcsijxkf81.jpg">https://i.redd.it/nsuxcsijxkf81.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: oh dear
 darkhorse64: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: love it.  there's a good message there
 Astrobytes: Yep. You can build anything with lego, not just the model on the box
 Astrobytes: :P
 Wontonimo: ninjadip , all recursion can be converted into a loop with a stack or queue
 Astrobytes: ^ what I said earlier in a less succinct way
 ninjadip: Wontonimo i know that they are interchangeable, was asking more when to use one vs the other and i think i got it. just to use it more to have it as a viable option for me against future problems
 ninjadip: i heard it makes nearly identical machine code, 
 Wontonimo: i maybe use recursion too much.  personally i like it for problems that are a loop with stack management.
 Wontonimo: idk about that
 struct: I never use recursion
 Wontonimo: recursion will use "The Stack"
 jacek: even for minimax?
 ninjadip: just waht some youtuber said
 struct: i dont use miimax
 struct: minimax
 Wontonimo: which is way smaller than allocatiing a stack
 Astrobytes: ^ hence my "if you have enough stack space" comment 
 Astrobytes: recursion is nice on paper
 Astrobytes: and quite elegant at times in practice
 ninjadip: and sometimes very nice in code too
 Astrobytes: yep
 ninjadip: that's what i was trying to say ealier, if the code looks natural in a recursion then it's a good fit
 ninjadip: is what i had gathered from this video
 ninjadip: if it looks forced you should be using iteration and vice versa
 ninjadip: if you are using iteration and using a recursion style solving process you're code will reflect that 
 struct: I guess thats why he mentioned natural
 Wontonimo: for this problem <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paving-with-bricks">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paving-with-bricks</a> 
 Wontonimo: i started with recursion
 Wontonimo: bad mistake
 Wontonimo: switched to a stack with a loop and it was way faster
 Wontonimo: and looks cleaner tbh
 Wontonimo: breaking out of a loop is faster than breaking out of a deep recursion
 Astrobytes: if time complexity and stack size isn't an issue it's fine to use recursion, otherwise don't - even if it seems a good fit (unless it's a pre-set exercise you have to do)
 ninjadip: can someone help me explain the first line of output on this?

 Wontonimo: to a stop?
 BadBurger: im working on marslander 3, gave up on it couple years ago, but got back into programming here
 Wontonimo: yeah, mars 3 was hard for me.  took a month
 BadBurger: yeah, to calc my speed, and gravity, and how many steps it would be required to stop with thrust 4
 Wontonimo: there is physics for thatV^2 = 2aS
 Wontonimo: where V is velocitya is accelerationS is distance
 Wontonimo: solving for S, is V^2 / 2a
 BadBurger: thx
 Wontonimo: and since at most you can apply 4-3.711 m/s acceleration
 Wontonimo: it is S = V^2 / (2*(4-3.711))
 Wontonimo: in the Y direction only

 struct: the bot will have a ban list 
 struct: and ban everyone once it joins
 Rebollo: Guys someone mentioned here in the chat that I was allocating the node one-by-one and it would be better to allocate man at the same time..
 Rebollo: But I dindt get how to do that
 Rebollo: I dont remember aalso who told me that
 struct: do you want to allocate all at the same time?
 eulerscheZahl: big static array?
 eulerscheZahl: "allocate man"are you playing 9 men's morris?
 Rebollo: Its a tree where I am controlling the possible paths of golf balls to the holes
 struct: struct Tree {	Node* nodes;};Node* Tree::nodes = new Node[46'000'000]();
 struct: a wait
 struct: I forgot static
 struct: struct Tree {	static Node*	nodes;};Node* Tree::nodes = new Node[46'000'000]();
 eulerscheZahl: is that ' in the number valid code now?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: interesting. I know about _ in other languages
 Rebollo: why ou choose this number?
 Rebollo: 46'000'000
 eulerscheZahl: are you trolling me again?
 Astrobytes: and it's encouraged to make use of the '
 struct: im not euler
 struct: Rebollo its the max number of nodes I can allocate
 jacek: trolling? who? Automaton2000?
 struct: or close to it due to ram size
 Automaton2000: you will love it have a good evening
 eulerscheZahl: that's for chars. C++ re-purposing things again
 struct: also works like this 0b'000'000'000
 struct: I think

 eulerscheZahl: that's what I know from C#
 Rebollo: And insnt it a memory wast if I am not using all of them?
 Astrobytes: it does struct, yes
 struct: well i dont know if i will use all of it
 struct: yeah  but the ' cant be right after the b
 struct: I just tried to be sure
 Rebollo: AAnd where this limit number come from?
 struct: 768MB
 struct: limit for all CG machines
 Rebollo: nnice to know thanks
 Astrobytes: euler, with C++ it's been like that since C++14
 Astrobytes: at least
 eulerscheZahl: i learned C++11 at university, i'm that old
 Astrobytes: I initially learned a bit pre c++11, I'm *that* old
 struct: just wait until you see modern c++ code
 Astrobytes: 20 looks interesting
 eulerscheZahl: my first was turbo pascal with an editor that didn't support the use of a mouse. my teacher at school was that old
 struct: o.o
 Rebollo: nice
 struct: rebollo care about static though
 struct: if you have multiple trees
 struct: all will be sharing the same nodew
 struct: nodes*
 struct: I think better way to do this is just
 Astrobytes: I learned to type (officially, in school) on old IBM machines with  5¼-inch (actually floppy) floppy disks, school didn't have much of a budget
 struct: struct Tree{vector&lt;Node*&gt; nodes(46'000'000);};
 struct: the memory will be allocated once you create the tree
 struct: at least I hope it will
 eulerscheZahl: i never learned proper typing. using my own system to this day
 Rebollo: thankYou I will do that
 Rebollo: how about programming in punched cards?
 eulerscheZahl: i can type blindly but not utilizing all 10 fingers
 Astrobytes: it was necessary to learn this way to pass the business studies course, I had my own way already by that age
 Rebollo: My mother used to programming using cards where you do a hole on it to create the rules aand give it to the teacher
 Rebollo: next dy he come back with  dump
 Astrobytes: this was the class where we had to type to the rhythm of Boney M songs
 Astrobytes: Rebollo, punchcards! Nice!
 Rebollo: I probably caan´t write aa Hello Worl with this method
 Rebollo: imagine how differente waas the coding processing
 Astrobytes: I'm sure you could if you learned&#160;;)
 Rebollo: You have to caare bout all the limitations of resources aas well
 Rebollo: soo nice my mother used to coding in FORTRAN
 Astrobytes: To be honest, the world would be a better place if everybody programmed as if they had very limited resources
 Rebollo: right!!
 Astrobytes: Systems might be a little more efficient for a start!
 jacek: like on CG?
 Astrobytes: I don't mean cramming everything into weird unicode characters
 eulerscheZahl: read a news recently, microsoft recommending that you keep your computer online for at last 2h without interrupt so it can download updates
 struct:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: 2. Hours.
 eulerscheZahl: and 6 to install
 struct: must be for W11 or something
 struct: My pc doesnt support it
 Astrobytes: lol what
 Astrobytes: Same struct
 eulerscheZahl: read like it doesn't continue the download but completely restarts it
 struct: This seems like a thing that happened to 1 person and made it to the news

 Astrobytes: updates always run fast on my windows box
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I used to cut a little notch into my floppies to make them double sided
 Rebollo: My mother, 50 years ago, created a statiscs program the output the probality of finding crude/petroleum in a certaing place
 Astrobytes: lol at the notch cutting, forgot about that
 Astrobytes: Rebollo: that is pretty awesome
 Astrobytes: sad it's about fossil fuels but still a cool program and achievement
 Rebollo: Quantitative Method in Oil Drilling
 Rebollo: amaazing
 Astrobytes: Was her thesis project or work?
 Rebollo: octoral edgree thesis
 Rebollo: Doctoral Degree
 Astrobytes: Excellent. Your mother is awesome
 Rebollo: in Quantitaative Methods
 Rebollo: She is
 Rebollo: Unfortunaattlly my dad didd not "aloow" her to work
 Astrobytes: Damn, that's sad man.
 Astrobytes: "Traditional values"
 Rebollo: yes
 jacek: computers then wouldnt fit in kitchen anyway
 Rebollo: 50 years ago in brazil
 Astrobytes: back in your box jacek
 Rebollo: How aabout in your country?
 Rebollo: Was the same 50 eyars ago?
 Astrobytes: yes Rebollo, your mother was pushing boundaries for sure.And yes, still is to some degree for people of a certain age or upbringing
 jacek: wah, computers here 50 years ago!?
 Astrobytes: There are people I went to school with and younger who believe a woman should be in the kitchen only, sigh
 Rebollo: One computer occupied like  a big room
 Rebollo: AAre you guys professional coders?I am a BI consultant,. Basic create maanagement reports using SQL, an frontends like PowerBI, Tableau an etc..
 Rebollo: Working for Intel at the moment
 Rebollo: as Contractor
 eulerscheZahl: i'm getting paid for coding. but as a single developer in a department that does other stuff (CAD design)
 eulerscheZahl: i do all from windows desktop to web development as we see need
 Astrobytes: Hobby coder here
 MrAnderson: Former coder here, moved on to more of an architect
 helpmefindaname: I am a data scientist/ML-Engineer
 jacek: android developer :scream:
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3eb9f2e-ddaa-46f1-8403-d79632f4d26b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3eb9f2e-ddaa-46f1-8403-d79632f4d26b</a>
 Rebollo: In this case
 Rebollo: Can I just initiaalize the node in the constructor?
 Rebollo: nodes*
 struct: its already initialized
 Rebollo: where?
 struct: once you do
 struct: int main(){Tree tree;}
 struct: all the 46M will be initialized
 struct: I think
 struct: or its before im not sure how it works
 struct: I just know it does
 Rebollo: but where is this guy?
 Rebollo: objectsNode* Tree::nodes = new objectsNode[46'000'000]();
 Rebollo: outside the struct, in the main?
 struct: just outside the struct
 struct: also outside of the main
 Rebollo: wow
 eulerscheZahl: right after your header includes
 eulerscheZahl: and after the struct definition of course
 Rebollo: what if I move it to the Tree contructor? Why you choose doiing like thaat?
 Rebollo: like
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c462873-f6db-4bd0-9d30-e11fd153c265">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c462873-f6db-4bd0-9d30-e11fd153c265</a>
 Rebollo: Hum, because they can be use indepentetly to the tree right
 Rebollo: And I crete just once
 Rebollo: I got it
 eulerscheZahl: rubber duck debugging at its finest
 Rebollo: no no I think I don´t
 struct: the code you pasted here before should work fine
 struct: but I would not use 46M
 struct: since your objectsData is probably bigger than 16 bytes
 Rebollo: But why you suggest to have "nodes" (plural") inside the tree once a need only to track the root reference and thigs like that?
 Rebollo: why a vector of nodes inside the tree?
 eulerscheZahl: the children of each node
 eulerscheZahl: where to expand to
 struct: yeah I expand on the tree
 struct: it depends on your code
 struct: You can also just make a global variable
 Rebollo: their position on the vector, in this case has a meaning or not necessarily?
 Rebollo: Or keep using linked lists?
 struct: well its your choice how to keep track of it
 Rebollo: cause I have like pointers to "right", "left", "down", "up", "parent" and "next"
 Rebollo: in the Noe
 Rebollo: Node
 eulerscheZahl: not sure what they mean and how they differ
 eulerscheZahl: up vs parent?
 Rebollo: let me make aa diagram one sec
 eulerscheZahl: down? the tree gets wider at each level
 struct: I think he is solving the golf puzzle
 struct: winamax
 Rebollo: They represents the possible Paths
 eulerscheZahl: oh right. i got that and forgot it again
 Rebollo: firtMovemment can be represent any direction
 Rebollo: second asa well
 Rebollo: aand so on
 eulerscheZahl: no MCTS, sorry
 Rebollo: Is this solution riddiculous?
 Rebollo: What would be your strategies?
 eulerscheZahl: bruteforce the hell out of it
 eulerscheZahl: worked for me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/gKEsyM8.png">https://i.imgur.com/gKEsyM8.png</a>where did the pictures go?
 struct: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: also: switched to flameshot for screenshots. pretty handy as it's not a browser addon so i can screenshot everything and it can upload directly to imgur&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: do you have the pictures?
 struct: on incognito it doesnt show for me
 eulerscheZahl: funny
 struct: you dont like shareX?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know shareX
 struct: ah I think its windows only
 eulerscheZahl: used lightshot before but more often than not the upload got stuck as the server was unreachable
 struct: flameshot  looks to have nice features too
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de04d007-17fc-4ce3-9c7c-d99e4715ed4f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de04d007-17fc-4ce3-9c7c-d99e4715ed4f</a>
 Rebollo: each node has 4  child wich represents the direction RDLU
 Rebollo:  And to make easy to navigate in the tree 
 Rebollo: trey have also next(same level move)
 Rebollo: and parent(go baackwrds)
 Rebollo: Each ball has it own tree
 Rebollo: I an golf game
 Rebollo: Once I reach a node that I cant go annywhere I go back
 Rebollo: till I find I possible way to the hole
 Rebollo: But different balls can find the same hole, and it is not possible, so I need to test some combinaatios till each ball has found one hole and all holes has been found
 Rebollo: seems easy but..not for me
 Rebollo: I tried recursion
 Rebollo: And things get crazy
 Rebollo: It inverts everything
 Rebollo: never will undertand the recursion behavior
 Scarfield: there is a lot of bad material explaining recursion out there, found a good article, but cant find it again&#160;:'(
 Rebollo: always use factor
 Rebollo: ALWAYS
 jacek: to find recursion you need to find recursion first
 Scarfield: factor?
 Astrobytes: factorisation
 Scarfield:&#160;!?
 Astrobytes: yep
 Rebollo: factorial
 Rebollo: like 10!
 Astrobytes: ^
 Rebollo: AALWAYSSS
 Astrobytes: factorial is what I meant
 Scarfield: i like you knew what i meant with&#160;!? xD
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: Spring challenge is bot programming Scarfield :tada:
 Scarfield: i just found out there is an interactive demo of smash the code 
 Scarfield: YUS!
 Astrobytes: End of April, formal announcement when artwork is completed
 Scarfield: how do you know, it doesnt say on the page
 struct: no annoucement yet but thibaud said it on the chat
 jacek: can we trust him?
 struct: yes
 struct: he was the one that said the fall challenge was a escape
 struct: and that was true
 Scarfield: nice! i am sure its solely because of my 1 forum post
 Astrobytes: obviously&#160;;)
 struct: what did you post?
 Rebollo: can I get the return "description" as string?
 Rebollo: ENUM*
 Rebollo: like&#160;:
 Astrobytes: as in enum to string?
 Rebollo: enum Direction&#160;: int { UP = 0, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT };
 Rebollo: aaan get "LEFT"
 Scarfield: there was a small thread where a few of us cried about escape as contest
 Astrobytes: Not currently in C++, you'll have to write your own code to do that
 struct: just do if else 
 struct: in a function where you pass the enum
 struct: or something
 Astrobytes: or a switch
 Rebollo: wow
 Rebollo: have to suplicaate the object maybe
 Rebollo: create a vector of texts
 Astrobytes: well, a simple array would be enough, then you could do enumStringArray[LEFT] and get "LEFT"
 Scarfield: did not expect bot programming contest, am actually kinda stoked, will make sure to tell CG staff that as well
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: Ill do that
 Astrobytes: FWIW I think they're fully aware of our thoughts on the matter Scarfield :D
 struct: Theyll need to do some work on the announcemenet
 Astrobytes: wdym struct?
 struct: probably lost a few registrations due to the previous contest being an escape
 struct: basicly you could register right after contest ended 
 Astrobytes: ah right, heh heh, indeed
 struct: before
 Scarfield: true, but i voiced my dissapointment at escape contest, it only seems fair to voice that im happy with bot programming
 Astrobytes: Also true Wisefield
 Scarfield: i didnt register untill a few moments ago
 Scarfield: I am very wise in the ways of science
 Astrobytes: Not registered as of yet, going euler style this time around
 struct: ill register to pump the numbers
 stocklog_: is there any like normal (not game) puzzles
 stocklog_: or is it only clash of code?
 Astrobytes: hundreds, under Practice in the top menu
 Alshock: There are bots versus, and solo puzzle
 Astrobytes: Also bot programming, optimisation and code golf in multiplayer
 Alshock: not sure what you call "a game"
 Astrobytes: hi Alshock
 Alshock: hi Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: happy for the contest?
 Astrobytes: lol, just saw discord, that'll be a 'yes'
 Alshock: yep, I'll make sure to have time for this one, I usually just skip them and work on the bots afterwards
 Astrobytes: lol, definitely make the most of it while it's happening. Who knows if / when there will be another :D

 Wontonimo: you asked me yesterday
 Jayarrowz: Imagine python against c# if we had a benchmark mode
 Jayarrowz:&#160;:)
 Manchi_o6o7: I know, but it is not bad to get advice if someone has direct experience about internships and recruiting
 Derek_DSouza: hi
 struct: HI
 pablodev: Hi Manchi im waiting response for internship too
 pablodev: (not remote)
 BadBurger: not too happy with my marslander algo, i have made a good path finder that draws a good path to landingpad with 300xy interval
 BadBurger: did a visual offline sim for it. but im not too happy with how ive implemented the lander to follow the path.
 BadBurger: probably could improve alot by making a better scoring system. but is there anything i can read to get some better ideas of how to get the lander to follow a path i have as xy coordinates
 BadBurger:&#160;?
 BadBurger: maybe its kinda broad question.
 Wontonimo: what is your scoring heuristic?
 Wontonimo: you probably are not using straight line distance
 Wontonimo: cuz otherwise you'll crash into the side of the cave
 Wontonimo: i made a grid, where each grid square represents about 20x20 coordinates, and I flood fill that, going around the cliff outcrop
 Wontonimo: the flood fill keeps incrementing, so it is a distance lookup
 Wontonimo: if i crash into a wall, i look up the flood fill distance to get the heuristic score
 BadBurger: im using the lander2 maps since im still building some fundametnals. my scoring is a mess,  but it favours the path for scoring, but has some ngative modifiers, such as speeds. i sim 200 ships at a time for 10loops, and pick the best ship, it takes that ship as starter point, and loops 10 frames again.
 BadBurger: sometimes it sticks to the path like a train, but sometimes like a headless chicken
 BadBurger: the path os qiuite smooth curved, with alot of points, it gives better score the closer it follows the path. 
 Wontonimo: i don't have a path, i have a distance field, and a landing error.  crash off the pad and the landing error is largest.  crash on the landing pad but not too bad, the error is a bit bad
 Wontonimo: don't make it to the landing pad, the error is less than a crash, but just
 Wontonimo: total heuristic score is distance (using flood fill) and landing error
 BadBurger: yeah i have finished 50% on mars lander 4 with just a small sim and ifs, but im enjoying creating this but i feel im not that educated in different algos and have a lack of math expressions
 Wontonimo: lander 4? 
 BadBurger: 3, lol 
 Wontonimo: can you send me a replay of both the caves&#160;?  By seeing the behaviour i may be able to suggest something
 BadBurger: i dont use that code, and i made it 4years ago on python2.7 wich is no longer supported in cg, its on python3 but python 2.7 cont have same syntax 
 Wontonimo: ah
 BadBurger: and the current im doing locally, i built a graphical sim
 BadBurger: so i can understand pathfinding and bots better
 BadBurger: or behaviour
 Wontonimo: do you have something working for mars 1&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that you can share?
 BadBurger: aint marslander 1 just a single row puzzle?
 Wontonimo: optimize it!  use the least amount of fuel possible.  here is mine <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/606574054">https://www.codingame.com/replay/606574054</a>
 Wontonimo: and that way you know that your landing algo is bang on
 Wontonimo: so, how much fuel does your lander have left?
 BadBurger: il do marslander1 now and check if i get close to you
 Wontonimo: 300 is the target, anything higher is just gravy 
 Wontonimo: try to land with a vertical speed that you set.  My lander is set to land with 39m/s, the absolute highest allowed
 darkhorse64: 321 is the best I could do
 thaturkey: hello
 dmuraco: hello
 ElJafar: yo
 Wontonimo: wow, you beat me by a large margin
 struct: hi Wontonimo I seem to have finished derivatives and partial derivatives
 struct: It seems easier now
 wontonimo: [automated] hey there struct
 struct: o.o
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: i forgot i make that automated response
 Wontonimo: so, now that you know about derivatives, you can rest assured that you'll probably not ever need to use it
 struct: o.o
 Wontonimo: but it will help with understanding
 Wontonimo: like knowing basic assembly
 struct: Yeah
 struct: its more like to understand how it works right?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: and that will already put you km ahead of others who just use libraries
 struct: the partial is to measure how much one input affects the output right?
 Wontonimo: i'm actually not even all that knowledgable of partials.  tell me more about it
 Wontonimo: oh, maybe i am and i forgot the name
 Wontonimo: that's when you only do parts at a time
 CCampa: what's sup yo
 CCampa: someone tryna slide answers?
 struct: yeah its similar to derivatives you just have to do for each independent input
 struct: so if you have f(a,b,c) you need to do for each one
 Wontonimo: oh funny, i just helped my daughter with partial derivatives last week.  totally forgot the name of it
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's a good method for break down a problem
 struct: tomorrow ill dive down into backprop, was gonna be today but i wanted to understand this well
 Wontonimo: youll beat me to it!!!  OMG :scream:
 struct: beat on what?
 Wontonimo: still havent applied my NN knowlage to CG
 struct: oh but you already understand them
 Wontonimo: but not at CG optmi level
 struct: im sure you can do it
 struct: you even have muzero has a source if you want
 Wontonimo: im just lazy
 struct: maybe you just do it too often that you dont have motivation to do it here
 Wontonimo: no, what it is is that I know it's actually quite a bit of work to get the whole pipeline going
 Wontonimo: and there isn't much visible progress until it is all done
 struct: you dont need to write the training part do you?
 Wontonimo: and i'm kinda in an immediate gratification mood these days
 struct: you can just use some framework
 Wontonimo: yeah, for sure.  definitely would use tensorflow
 Wontonimo: I'm not completely ignoring my machine learning background.  I'm actually really stoked about my lates contrib to puzzles 
 Wontonimo: very much ML and data science
 CCampa: this man triple texted 
 Wontonimo: i'll kick myself, thanks

 Juicer24: what c++ youtubers do you guys like to watch? trying to learn more
 WellyBelly: Jeff I have not completed a project on NN. 
 Wontonimo: watch "the coding train" for programming know how if you are learning
 WellyBelly: But i flew a chopper in nam
 Wontonimo: WellyBelly has been kicked
 Alpha.Queen: ummmm so I have a question
 Juicer24: but wasnt it related  to coding?

 dmuraco: wontonimo thanks man you rerailed the train it was going out of bounds
 Wontonimo: hey dmuraco, you haven't gotten high in any bot battle yet.  have you taken a look at them?  Perhaps give Tron or Botters of the Galaxy a try
 dmuraco: uhhhh ill check it out 
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing</a>  &lt;-- this is Tron
 struct: Wontonimo any reason why you mentioned oware?
 Wontonimo: turn left, right
 Wontonimo: oh, i thought that was generally regarded as the starter NN multi
 dmuraco: when things are hard I just quit so we'll see
 struct: ah I see
 Wontonimo: idk, i havent even tried 1 so I couldn't say which multi would be the easiest to apply NN to
 struct: I thought about bt because I have a bit of experience with it and its an easy game too see if AI is doing well or not
 Wontonimo: +1
 dmuraco: Neural Network?
 Wontonimo: yes
 dmuraco: ohhhh
 dmuraco: those are cool
 dmuraco: used one of them doo hickeys to predict stock prices didnt work tho 
 Wontonimo: no.  that's not a good idea.  using a NN to predict a random number generator isn't going to do much.
 struct: might aswell run rand()
 dmuraco: LoL yeah was just experimenting
 Wontonimo: i was the lead dev at a hedge fund in 2008.  fun times.
 dmuraco: i laughed at that 
 dmuraco: what did you work on
 Wontonimo: machine learning to predict SMP500, intra minute trades
 Astrobytes: Ugh. Hope you disinfected your brain after working for those crooks.
 Wontonimo: yeah, crooks is right.  the whole industry is crooks selling to crooks
 Astrobytes: 100%
 Astrobytes: We're just currency to that world.
 Astrobytes: anyway, cya all later
 Wontonimo: cya
 dmuraco: sorry i was busy getting 3rd place in coc flex
 Wontonimo: hey Struct, what is your plan for training your NN.  What is your training data going to be?
 struct: no idea yet
 Wontonimo: it's tricky
 dmuraco: wontonimo what language did you use at hedge fund
 Wontonimo: i think
 struct: I only read 8 chapters out of 22
 Wontonimo: java
 struct: The first are really basic
 Wontonimo: so, if the NN training is supervised then it becomes easy, but what is the supervised data? 
 dmuraco: what kind of machine learning model did you use
 Wontonimo: self play is a option , but then you can easily have model collapse
 Wontonimo: probably just DNN dmuraco
 struct: well i dont really have supervised data for breakthrough
 Wontonimo: aka fully connected layers
 Wontonimo: you can generate supervised data.  i was thinking of this a long time ago and after talking with Jacek he confirmed that it works for him
 dmuraco: gotcha
 Wontonimo: you use your current MCTS (or whatever search) to predict a score for the current board
 Wontonimo: that becomes your training set.  if your NN can estimate that in 1ms what your MCTS took 100ms to generate, then huge win.
 Wontonimo: you can then use the NN in a negamax way to see much further into the future than the MCTS could
 struct: makes sense
 Wontonimo: what search are you using for BT atm?
 struct: mcts
 Wontonimo: i don't see how self play can be used for training
 Wontonimo: easily
 struct: isnt marchete muzero self training?
 Wontonimo: is that the article he wrote or is that a whole code that he hhas shared?
 struct: in the article
 struct: "A pure self-learning AI, it only learns by playing against itself (or previous NN versions). For the whole training it never competes against any other AI bot (only itself), neither any kind of expert knowledge, opening books or anything."
 struct: also no domain knowledge
 Wontonimo: yeah, i get that
 struct: I dont think his code has the training part
 Wontonimo: i'm just fuzzy on how to extract and apply data for a learning signal
 struct: yeah i also have no idea yet
 Wontonimo: i'm clear on how to do unsupervised learning to do things like autoencoders and embeding layer generation
 struct: yeah one thing that confuses me the most is
 struct: that the initial state is very different from the ending state
 struct: How can NN even train sucesfully for that
 struct: The weights will be the same
 struct: But I guess that also apply to other things that NNs can do
 Wontonimo: i can imagine that you use a recording of the whole game play.  all the moves for the winning player become part of the positive training set and all the move for the losing player become part of the negative training set.  seems cheap though and i'd be surrprised if it worked
 struct: If I figure it out Ill let you know :p
 therealbeef: Indeed Wontonimo that's how I did it. all the game states on the way to a victory are good and on a way to a loss are bad
 Wontonimo: OH&#160;!
 Wontonimo: and do you have a decay, like earlier moves have less weight, and moves right before the end move have the most weight?
 therealbeef: I didn't make a really successful bot with it (probably due to bad choice of search algo), but it does improve it's strength over time
 therealbeef: yes
 Wontonimo: awesome!  thanks for sharing&#160;!!
 therealbeef: gane states in the beginning of a match are probably less predictable
 therealbeef: but that depends on the type of game maybe
 Wontonimo: what multi have you used NN in therealbeef&#160;?
 therealbeef: spring2021
 Wontonimo: solid gold.  nice
 Wontonimo: what search did you use after the NN was trained
 therealbeef: alpha beta
 therealbeef: which is probably a bad choice
 Wontonimo: no, i hear that works well with NN
 therealbeef: but i had no exprience with mcts yet back then
 struct: also the game should be tricky
 Wontonimo: what depth, and is it just value, or value and policy?
 therealbeef: i trained just game state eval, no policy
 Josdel: tacos
 Wontonimo: value, cool.  jacek has been pretty positive about using just value/eval also
 Josdel: hello guys
 Josdel: all fine?
 Wontonimo: tacos?  read my bio Josdel
 Josdel: yep....
 Josdel: how do you write in red?
 therealbeef: i think alpha beta requires very fast eval due to the way it searches, so funnily the bot i started with has super simple NN (but fast) and i never managed to beat it after changing to a more complex CNN
 Wontonimo: i have a magic marker
 Wontonimo: jk.  text will appear in red when it has your name in it
 Josdel: Wontonimo hello
 Josdel: hmm
 therealbeef: i think mcts searches smarter so it can deal with slower eval maybe
 Wontonimo: yup, it worked.  sadly my auto reply didn't kick off
 Josdel: careful man
 Wontonimo: did you add pruning to alphabeta?
 Wontonimo: must have otherwise it would be minimax
 Wontonimo: dumb question on my end
 Wontonimo: i'm wondering if NN value would work with Beam search
 therealbeef: sure why not&#160;:)
 therealbeef: it basically replaces a handwritten heuristic
 Wontonimo: but better
 therealbeef: but also slower
 therealbeef: there's a tradeoff
 therealbeef: if a game is so simple you can handwrite a super fast eval, it might be better
 Wontonimo: did you use any intrinsics to speed up and parallelize the matrix calculations?
 therealbeef: yes
 struct: avx?
 Wontonimo: :scream_cat:
 therealbeef: yes, 8 float vectors
 struct: how many hidden layers?
 therealbeef: hehe the submitted bot has only 1 hidden layer&#160;;) the re-designed bot had like 8 orso and it couldn't beat the single hidden layer one
 struct: maybe the 8 one was too slow
 therealbeef: but please take my experiences with a pinch of salt; this was my first try with NN on CG
 struct: if you ran it for the same iterations it would probably beat the other one
 struct: ofc
 therealbeef: yes i think so
 struct: Im sure if you tried in other game you probably would have more success
 struct: you only saw 1 NN at the top on the contest afterall
 Wontonimo: 8 hidden layer?  That is bordering on untrainable without tricks like resnet layers or batchnormalization.  
 therealbeef: i think it can be very tricky to choose exactly the kind of network architecture that trades off speed and quality
 therealbeef: i did use relu activation everywhere
 POEJordanJ: Hm
 therealbeef: and when inspecting the weights in the first layer graphically, it did seem like it is looking for patterns such as having two big trees that can never shadow each other
 struct: was reading the marchete tutorial and now one hots make sense to me
 Wontonimo: :tada:
 struct: at least one part of it :p
 Wontonimo: that is a beast of a tutorial
 struct: too many terms I dont know yet 
 Wontonimo: i totally messed up an explanation of gradient descent yesterday (or was it the day before?) here on world chat 
 Wontonimo: it was so bad... i'd like to go back and delete that chat history
 struct: do not worry :p
 Wontonimo: so, i've got this bot on here.  it looks for clash links and when people say hi to me.  I was thinking of adding some kind of gamification ...
 struct: to play vs him?
 Wontonimo: no, here on world chat
 Wontonimo: i was thinking of the "golden taco of the hour" award.  the way it worrks is anyone can say "I nominate  ____ for the golden taco award"
 Wontonimo: and the bot keeps track of who gets the most nomination for that hour and awards them 1
 Wontonimo: reporting how many they have accumulated in their life time
 Wontonimo: 1 per hour at most
 Wontonimo: thoughts?
 struct: hmm I dont think chat is active enough for it
 Wontonimo: per day?
 struct: would probably be better yeah
 struct: with hour it would just spam too much I think
 Wontonimo: true
 Wontonimo: can't nominate twice
 Wontonimo: nor yourself
 Astrobytes: I like that idea
 struct: I'm out for the night
 struct: gn everyone
 Wontonimo: gn
 Astrobytes: gn, I'm not far off, in bed, on the laptop
 Wontonimo: gn also
 Astrobytes: just finishing these last few lines of code :P
 Wontonimo: on what?
 Astrobytes: right now UTTT, but earlier was practising my javascript
 Wontonimo: for roguer path&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: indeed&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: are you going to submit uttt before hheading off to sleep?
 Astrobytes: nah, just finishing the sim, only started it properly last night in bed lol
 Wontonimo: your last submit was about 2 years ago :scream_cat:
 Astrobytes: yep, it was a rainy day multi for me, I find it a touch boring
 Wontonimo: use MC for the first search.  you'll knock off the logic for MC in no time and it'll throw you up to gold
 Wontonimo: here is my MC example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a>
 Astrobytes: Was thinking to go full MCTS 
 Wontonimo: well YEAH of course
 Astrobytes: all good, I can write MCs with my eyes closed&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: MCTS all the way.  but MC is 1/10th the effort and will get you to top Gold if your sim is optimized
 Wontonimo: plus, the rollout is completely reusable for MCTS
 Astrobytes: I'll see tomorrow when I get round to that part
 Wontonimo: am i pushing MC too much :rolling_eyes: ... probably eh?
 Wontonimo: night
 Astrobytes: lol nah, it's the first port of call in most problems usually
 Astrobytes: anyway, yes, gn  :)
 therealbeef: what's MC?
 jacek: monte carlo
 therealbeef: is that like MCTS without expansion?
 jacek: yes. flat monte carlo
 jacek: for each move simulate 1000 (or so) games and choose one with heighest wins
 BaseMcfly: How do you see your solved puzzles/solutions from practice mode?
 jacek: they should be at the bottom
 Wontonimo: hey jacek, when did you get on?  have you been lurking for a while?
 Wontonimo: could have used your $0.02 a while ago about NN training in self play
 Wontonimo: that's my round about way of saying I missed you :grin:
 jacek: im a bit sick so i got up earlier
 Wontonimo: what kind of sick?  no the covid i hope.  just something simple
 jacek: sore throat and headache. typical common cold
 jacek: but fortunately no rhintis
 Wontonimo: that's good
 Wontonimo: i'm tired.  heading off to sleep.  see ya later.  get well soon
 Josdel: bye bye
 Josdel: :hand_splayed:
 jacek: mods asleep, let's troll
 ETET:&#160;?
 ETET: How long have you all been learning code?
 jacek: since early teens, off and on about 20 years ~
 ASM_MOV_INT: probably since a year or so before 6th grade... and i'm 48 now, so....
 ASM_MOV_INT: :joy:
 Punkp: When I was 14... now I am 50 ...
 ASM_MOV_INT: i had a texas instruments computer at  very young age, don't remember how old, but I do remember in 6th grade I got an apple iic for christmas, and I was programming in BASIC on the Texas Instruments

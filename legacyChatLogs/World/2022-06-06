 tentoes: i need it
 Westicles: now 7/8 puzzle events french, 1 german
 derjack: :french_bread:
 tentoes: i neeeeeeeeed it
 Mykes: needers
 MSmits: derjack thanks for letting me know. That kaggle thing is going to be mostly machine learning though. 
 MSmits: I doubt they will accept me submitting an opening book attached to a brute force solver
 MSmits: I can easily do it. I have a local c4 solver that solves this in an hour or two and can also generate a book
 MSmits: "An Agent can have a maximum file size limit of 100 MB."
 MSmits: lol...
 MSmits: I can put the entire solved db in it
 derjack: machine learned db
 MSmits: An Agent will receive the following parameters: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60dea118-58ef-4a87-9958-97132c813271">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60dea118-58ef-4a87-9958-97132c813271</a>
 MSmits: so there's bigger ones. 
 derjack: so far only 7x6

 MSmits: is it possible to use a c++ bot in their py-file derjack?
 MSmits: like.. precompiled?
 TINOUAINANI: Hi,whay main(i){...} dont work in c++&#160;? (code golf)
 MSmits: seems like you can
 TINOUAINANI: i try it but not working 
 Mortis_666: TINOUAINANI i think u have to do int i instead of just i
 TINOUAINANI: yah so its not like c
 ninhchu: hello

 5DN1L: you don't
 5DN1L: like this,  TINOUAINANI
 5DN1L: I see it in normal colour, you see it in red
 Husoski: Anyone else think the "hard" puzzle for the current event is pretty "medium"?
 shaquille.oatmeal: .
 darkhorse64: 40 C++ lines of code for me
 darkhorse64: Once you know the idea, it's rather to solve. Same comment for "The resistance"
 darkhorse64: rather simple
 SamirPS: Hello
 NachSN: guys is there a way to add auto complete or do I have to type the whole name of the field / method each time?

 waterproofsodium: what's a gerry
 shaquille.oatmeal: shamone
 coder1404: hiiii 
 coder1404: how are u guys
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gerrymandering is easy puzzle, had to use memoization ... but oh well
 waterproofsodium: I finally won my 2nd shortest clash!
 waterproofsodium: only 1 more year for the 3rd :p
 Wontonimo: at this rate you will accumulate 34 more over your lifetime
 ERiny: Can any one give me link for robotic arm ,I want to solve it
 Wontonimo: the first part of the puzzle is finding the puzzle
 jacek: huh
 benia__yahia: hi there ara some sites like this one&#160;???
 struct: not really
 Westicles: is it mid june yet?
 eulerscheZahl: it's early June
 eulerscheZahl: and by CG standards, mid June means July or August
 Westicles: oh, we'll all be dead from monkeypox by then
 eulerscheZahl: no, they will quickly fade out
 eulerscheZahl: do you remember pig flu about 10 years ago?
 Westicles: I remember all that nonsense the last 2+ years
 eulerscheZahl: there we disagree. covid is worse than just a normal flu. and climate change is real and caused by humans
 eulerscheZahl: and Russia is in war against Ukraine, not the other way
 Westicles: well, we agree on point 3
 Westicles: anyhow, you can all enjoy my monkeypox clash
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2017829c9b36c19b13955ed1467b8f50350ed">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/2017829c9b36c19b13955ed1467b8f50350ed</a>
 eulerscheZahl: easy enough but not trivial. looks fine for a clash
 eulerscheZahl: greedy will do for solving
 struct: what happened to multis becoming featured?
 struct: havent heard anything else about it
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 Westicles: they are focused on french puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm not on discord, i barely get any news these days
 Wontonimo: I agree with Lisa-Has-Ideas for replacing "monkeypox" with "cooties".
 Westicles: 7/8 french, 1/8 german
 eulerscheZahl: french puzzles?
 Westicles: events
 struct: yesterday I submited a good bot for c4 to serve as boss
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how elaborate their boss selection is. didn't check for deterministic code in the last contest
 eulerscheZahl: not sure about computation time used
 struct: it uses 5ms per turn
 struct: its rank 13
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even know which will be the first community puzzle with leagues. or of it's all the way up to legend
 struct: It should be connect 4
 struct: If they take into account player count
 Westicles: connect4 isn't french
 eulerscheZahl: 444 players at connect4
 eulerscheZahl: not the most popular one
 struct: it isnt?
 eulerscheZahl: but it can overtake soon
 eulerscheZahl: dots and boxes with 452
 struct: ah
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium only 341
 eulerscheZahl: too lazy to check the others
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know if they go by player count. a board game isn't exactly noob friendly to progress and improve
 eulerscheZahl: hard to see what's going on and spot bad moves
 struct: yeah I have no idea how to play c4
 struct: Breakthrough is easy to understand though 
 Westicles: fireworks most likely.  french author, tricky to figure out
 eulerscheZahl: the penguins were pretty cool
 eulerscheZahl: also with a pretty viewer
 Westicles: oh, yeah definitely penguins.  even I liked that one
 jacek: or onitama. but thats too easy
 eulerscheZahl: startup for the graphics
 eulerscheZahl: oh, locam2 got an update. the statement doesn't physically attack you anymore
 kovi:&#160;:)
 kovi: i hope locam will be contest
 kovi: otherwise its too empty
 kovi: if boardgame, something which is not (yet) nn-ed
 eulerscheZahl: locam was a contest
 kovi: locm1.5
 kovi: it is a contest, but without actors in arena, it is not fun
 eulerscheZahl: personally i see it as too close to the original contest to be of any interest
 eulerscheZahl: in the end thibaud will decide
 struct: randomized cards seem like a good addition
 struct: Does p1 still have an advantage?
 eulerscheZahl: they already did something about it right after the contest
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think anyone analyzed how much it helped
 jacek: wheres msmits when you need him
 eulerscheZahl: in the dungeon, fighting dragons
 Westicles: any of these worth asking for on CG?

 Snowdingerr: anyone willing to destroy us is welcome
 Westicles: Shiva joined the chat
 Blokops: mmm the certification exam was easier than i expected
 MSmits: MSmits is here, whats up?
 MSmits: I'm not going to look at locam any time soon, too much to do
 jason223366: im doing a clash of code and eveytime i change the code to what its meant too be it says success and then it reverts back once i go to the next one what am i doing wrong
 MSmits: :fingers_crossed: 38 seed db may finish in 3 hrs.... last iteration had 6 changes
 MSmits: otherwise hopefully tomorrow
 MSmits: wife heard the humming last night :P
 Wontonimo: are you hard coding rthe solution jason223366
 jason223366: hard coding?
 Wontonimo: congrats MSmits 
 MSmits: thanks and hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: are you writing code to dynamically solve the problem, or are you solving the problem youself and just outputting the solution
 struct: just ask your school to lend you the pcs for a week
 MSmits: meh not that helpful, i dont know how to parallelize it
 MSmits: otherwise i would be using more than 1 core in the first place
 MSmits: it's memory bottlenecked anyways
 jason223366: im confused all im doing is change the "found" to "expected" 
 MSmits: jason223366 your program has to be able to handle more kinds of input
 Wontonimo: i think you are missing the point.  write code to output found or expected given the situation
 MSmits: it has to work for all testcases without changing the code
 Wontonimo: ^^ that
 jason223366: i dont know code well enough to know how too do that i came on this website too learn code..
 Wontonimo: what programming language are you tryinng to learn?
 MSmits: jason223366 this website is not for complete newbies. It's mostly aimed at people that know the basics but want to get better
 MSmits: like, you know how to do loops, if/else input/output etc
 MSmits: in 1 language
 jason223366: im trying to learn c#
 kam_hack: hello
 Wontonimo: also, clash of code is a timed test.  Timed tests are not really a good place to learn a concept
 MSmits: nah, dont do clash, go do easy puzzles
 kam_hack: do onboarding a couple of times or go to a video on yt 
 MSmits: easy puzzles arent necessarily easier than clash, mostly they arent but you have time
 Wontonimo: but even easier than here if you are just starting jason223366
 MSmits: C# is a good choice to start with btw
 MSmits: thats how i got started
 Wontonimo: if this puzzle is too difficult for you, then this site is too difficult <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 jason223366: i wanna learn C# for unity
 MSmits: nice
 Wontonimo: oh, there are lots of unity tutorials on youtube
 kam_hack: ye prob
 MSmits: there's a difference between knowing how to code and knowing how to do computational thinking though
 AdemDj12: hey
 MSmits: knowing how the code works doesnt mean you can solve a problem with it
 AdemDj12: wassup guys
 MSmits: hi
 struct: hi
 mogzhey: hey
 MSmits: your dog wants a snek mogzhey
 AdemDj12: i just graduated finally&#160;:)
 mogzhey: haha yes
 MSmits: what did you graduate?
 jacek: :rada:
 jacek:  
 mogzhey: aye awesome, congrats AdemDj12
 AdemDj12: thanks thanks
 MSmits: did you graduate from university?
 jacek: kindergarten
 mogzhey: lmao
 AdemDj12: yup from uni i wont study again ever in my life
 jacek: no phd?
 MSmits: haha so you think 
 MSmits: but grats&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: you have finished the tutorial level of live
 AdemDj12: lol
 MSmits: I told myself exactly this AdemDj12 only to re-enroll 15 yrs later
 AdemDj12: am telling you it was the hardest tutorial ever
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWIi6Pytde8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWIi6Pytde8</a>
 AdemDj12: lol MSmits i think it has a bit of charm waking up and preparing for exams
 Wontonimo: it's easier later in life.  or so i'm told.
 MSmits: waking up?
 Wontonimo: uni
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: I was happy it was covid lockdown during my 2nd uni thing
 MSmits: no travel time and i could faze out stuff on zoom i already knew
 AdemDj12: hope you have a good time in your second thing
 MSmits: I graduated already
 MSmits: was only 1,5 yrs
 AdemDj12: ggs 
 MSmits: thanks
 AdemDj12: you passed tutorial twice
 MSmits: yep, different tutorial&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: sometimes it's worth it to go through the tutorial a second time to learn more about the meta
 Wontonimo: but then you realize that the tutorial has little to do with the rest of the game
 AdemDj12: i think not depending on where you live
 Wontonimo: and it's a weird game, we all gain levels at the same rate
 AdemDj12: how did you feel MSmits when studying with not you gen
 AdemDj12: i hope so Wonto 
 AdemDj12: btw is AntiWonto still alive
 struct: antiwonto ran out of tacos

 MSmits: AdemDj12 the average age of the other students was probably close to my age

 JadeOrSomething: Hi, I wanted to ask if I could get a little help. For reference I am programming in java doing the temperatures problem. I am stuck on the last check. It checks to see if there are no inputs and I need to then print 0. I am unsure how to check if there are no inputs. Currently I have an if statement with an n.equals(null) inside, however that is not working. I am kind of unsure how to proceed. 
 JadeOrSomething: n is the scanner that takes in the inputs
 JadeOrSomething: the error I am getting is "int cannot be dereferenced" 
 JadeOrSomething: nvm I got it.
 JadeOrSomething: Have a wonderful day everyone!

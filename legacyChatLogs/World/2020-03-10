 tekki: AutomatonNN tell me a fake news please
 AutomatonNN: I used a bot for that song
 tekki: who's next AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the code?
 tekki: no bug in code AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: hey guys for the replay
 tekki: someone here AUtomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: why do you need the red player and the bots are still a planet?
 tekki: who is red player AUtomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: even i can get it anyway
 tekki: next contest AUtomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: 5
 tekki: ok thx AUtomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: so after i change my code and then it's easy to predict him to see it as input
 tekki: go on dude but be fair enough
 tekki: AutomatonNN still here to protect us?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code and see what the boss would have to do to try it and se
 tekki: what would you do AUtomatonNN if you were god?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code and more than 100 ms
 tekki: AutomatonNN stop spamming euler please
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same player?
 tekki: AutomatonNN ask Automaton2000 when you have a question thx&#160;:)
 Automaton2000: it seems to me that i should get a good rank
 AutomatonNN: why is it a programming language?
 tekki: why not AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: Cyberpunk is the best with the bronze rule&#160;?
 tekki: don't know AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: temperature is a problem with a giant script to learn it
 tekki: issue AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: after the first time i see it
 eulerscheZahl: you owe me a chat history tekki
 tekki: yeah sorry euler
 tekki: hope it didn't disturb you so much
 eulerscheZahl: i just got up
 tekki: you know how bots could be 
 struct: There were some good things shared
 eulerscheZahl: but usually i read what i missed yesterday
 tekki: happy to see you euler
 tekki: AutomatonNN have some questions&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: :thinking:
 tekki: AutomatonNN is euler right on time?
 AutomatonNN: when are you doing a simulation for the contest?
 tekki: one day babe&#160;:)
 tekki: we'll see AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same code?
 tekki: just need your permission AUtomatonNN
 eulerscheZahl: is your profile right about you being in France?are you already or still awake?
 AutomatonNN: not if it's a good idea
 tekki: yeah still in france
 tekki: but don't tell it too loud
 tekki: i like to be safe
 eulerscheZahl: you behave like you live in a different timezone
 struct: today I dont sleep
 tekki: hummm
 struct: So I fix my sleep schedule
 struct: I quit my job today
 tekki: i sleep when i have to&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, no more bartending
 struct: So I have to fix  it
 eulerscheZahl: more time for Yinsh :D
 tekki: right now i'm in france
 struct: Now Im doing AVX

 PatrickMcGinnisII: My lookup table for Ultimate TTT is 424k ... so i suck, code size... what is max code size?  100k?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 tekki: don't know
 struct: 424k size lookup?
 struct: is it like opening book?
 eulerscheZahl: opening book i guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, i calculated all best combinations locally, then compressed so there would be no decision-making at all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: took a couple days
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh well, i start over
 struct: They should increase code size tbh
 struct: and remove history
 eulerscheZahl: nooo, my precious history
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like i can find anything on my HD at is is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol
 eulerscheZahl: they should use a versioning systemright now they store every code separately, no git or alike
 tekki: you're the boss in that story, ask if i can help you
 tekki: AUtomatonNN are you gonna kill someone today?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same code?
 tekki: ok AutomatonNN is in, what about Automaton2000?
 AutomatonNN: hey not sure what it is
 Automaton2000: i think you can do it with a lot of bugs
 tekki: Automaton2000 can we do it without bugs?
 Automaton2000: well i'm not sure if i will try to do it&#160;?
 tekki:&#160;:)
 tekki: i think i will be too dangerous too dude
 tekki: so what about AutomatonNN, Automaton2000 can we release&#160;?
 Automaton2000: not that hard to get in
 AutomatonNN: PatrickMcGinnisII what do you think is the best way to get the simulation and the rules and control 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AutomatonNN must be my bedtime
 AutomatonNN: why do you think i will try to improve your bot and be able to come up with a bot on the second one?
 tekki: AutomatonNN never sleep right AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: dbdr cyberpunk did you see the problem by the most recent factories?
 tekki: AutomatonNN can you help us?
 AutomatonNN: hey guys i have a question about coders strike back
 tekki: su AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: whooss the problem with the current position?
 tekki: talking about an revolutionnary idea AUtomatonNN
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok AutomatonNN tekki gn
 AutomatonNN: replace him a replay
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to destroy a lot of puzzles and forget about it
 tekki: gn Patrick
 struct: _mm256 AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: funny stupid stuff i think it will be a real message
 tekki: AutomatonNN did you get the order?
 AutomatonNN: why do you need that for the contest?
 tekki: no need AutomatonNN sorry
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same testcase?
 tekki: AutomatonNN ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: when you say you are not a robot
 AutomatonNN: "she, "same seed" and no difference between the next checkpoint in the chat
 tekki: thx AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: WHAT A BAD ARE CHATTENSE AFTER AND CODING
 tekki: any hope for humans AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: Zenoscave im not that same as what it is
 tekki: AutomatonNN i'll be back
 AutomatonNN: what are you trying to do?
 tekki: nothing don't worry buddy&#160;:)
 tekki: Automaton2000 how are you?
 Automaton2000: wanted to try it out
 tekki: can you wait Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: when u gonna get to legend with just one day
 tekki: when AutomatonNN is gonna die Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: what are you up to
 AutomatonNN: either that is a community puzzle
 tekki: it'a up to you AUtomaton2000, are you gonna kill me or AutomaotnNN?
 Automaton2000: i had a similar issue
 tekki: good boy AUtomaton2000
 Automaton2000: thats why they are at the bottom
 Manvir: Beets Bears Battle star galatica
 tekki: what you think about war AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: new code that got it
 tekki: can you erase war from your code AUtomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: what are you trying to do?
 tekki: are you curious or scared AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: and what if i can use a local variable name of a player on the testcase?
 tekki: try it AUtomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a code with a simple variable name of the compiler in the code a
 eulerscheZahl: bye
 tekki:&#160;:)
 tekki: where are you going eiler?
 tekki: bue eulerscheZahl
 tekki: are you having fun AUtomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: what is the difference between a strategy to search for good ideas?
 tekki: can you bring peace to earth AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: why would you give me code to the brutaltester property?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: morning
 Automaton2000: so i can start with a new language
 tekki: yeah create a new language AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: AutomatonNN are you talking about your moment?
 tekki: does your new language have a name AtomatonNN?
 tekki: does your new language have a name AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: I can't see the answer about the game
 tekki: and Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: csb is like the first thing i did in the past
 tekki: how old were you AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: hey guys
 tekki: hey waasup AutomatonNN?&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: cupioderming is the best pic for it
 tekki: humm interessing AutomatonNN, can you tell me more?&#160;:)
 tekki: Automaton2000 help AutomatonNN please
 AutomatonNN: what is this part of the contest?
 Automaton2000: i already have a decent bot
 tekki: AutomatonNN j'en ai marre de ces fils de pute, peux-tu m'aider stp?
 AutomatonNN: what game are you talking about?
 tekki: i'm talking about real life AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: when i get the creator of the contest i got a new contest
 tekki: what can you advice to humans AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN:  do I have to change your name to the code
 tekki: AutomatonNN can you clam me down please?
 AutomatonNN: i am a bot and i promised to crash it in the chat
 tekki: gimme a name AutomatonNN

 eulerscheZahl: what in particular? i don't read what the bot is telling us, just see when a red line appears
 dbdr: unicode hack
 eulerscheZahl: no, i got that from automaton, not the other way

 dbdr: the rise of the Automatons
 Marchete: don't use approximations for physics simulation struct

 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i wanted to make time limit more generous, but then we decided in favor of turn limit, that probably was a mistake
 wlesavo: also we need to clear whale from lb
 eulerscheZahl: it's still doable with the time limitbut i have to submit a few times to pass all testcasesi know a performance improvement, but that's a bit of refactoring
 eulerscheZahl: and yeah, the whale doesn't belong there :D
 wlesavo: can we ping Julian here, or only through discord?
 eulerscheZahl: discord is more likely i think
 wlesavo: may i ask you to do so? :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: cant do that from work and coming home pretty late
 eulerscheZahl: the whale itself reported it already
 wlesavo: oh, thats grate
 Elioh: hey euler&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Elioh: i wanted to thank you for your help man
 Elioh: im gonna soon land my first internship
 eulerscheZahl: nice, where?
 Elioh: its a company near me 
 Elioh: that does software development
 Elioh: and app development

 eulerscheZahl: yes, when you create a new account
 WildSmilodon: ah, ok, I guess that is a solution. Thanks
 darkhorse64: ssshhh, it's forbidden
 eulerscheZahl: i deleted my alts just yesterday
 darkhorse64: :innocent:
 darkhorse64: all of them
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: noticed that Thibaud was following one of my alts, while he isn't following my main accountshould i be worried?
 eulerscheZahl: then one i'm using right now is my only account remaining
 darkhorse64: Your alt is more interesting&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: didn't submit to a single arena

 Marchete: 316, what more do you need?
 eulerscheZahl: i need less, not more
 Marchete: what less do you need?
 eulerscheZahl: 6
 darkhorse64: Less is more
 Marchete: why not 3?
 eulerscheZahl: or 200 less, but not realistic
 eulerscheZahl: because trictrac is 5 below me
 Marchete: unless by luck I don't think 200 is reasonable
 Marchete: more like 300+
 eulerscheZahl: and my submits only occasionally get 100%
 Marchete: mine too
 Marchete: I still got timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: i even converted to C++
 eulerscheZahl: which i rarely do
 Marchete: maybe it's servers' fault
 eulerscheZahl: i think they use the same server type for optims now
 eulerscheZahl: no lucky servers anymore, which is why they made a full optim recalc
 struct: lucky servers?
 eulerscheZahl: in the first 1s i create all candidates and split for bulls/cows results based on the first guess i plan
 eulerscheZahl: then in the 2nd turn i group half of the remaining candidates the same way to get a quick filtering
 eulerscheZahl: other half in turn 3
 eulerscheZahl: still timing out
 eulerscheZahl: but i rolled back from array to vectorthese arrays with index of last item are ugly

 struct: hi
 struct: Nice bug
 struct: was creating email and password shows on username
 struct: on chromium
 struct: asking if it wants me to save it
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl can you tell on which cases you time out more often? There are slightly different bulls and cows on some cases of the same length, i wonder which ones are harder than the others
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's uniform, didn't try to analyze
 eulerscheZahl: length 10 obviously
 wlesavo: hm interesting, thx
 eulerscheZahl: and i had a 603 scorethat would have been a great result without that one timeout&#160;:(
 wlesavo: im feeling for you :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a solver? is still see you at 0%
 wlesavo: not yet, planning to finish better one for a while, submitted to test if validators updated after updating contribution
 struct: Are you going to keep updating it?
 eulerscheZahl: seems stable now, no need
 wlesavo: no, that was half an hour after approving
 eulerscheZahl: don't update after approval unless it's really broken
 eulerscheZahl: like my number shifting contribution&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: someone reversed the java random seed
 eulerscheZahl: so he had the map generator
 struct: I also updated Yavalath 30 minutes or so after it got approved
 wlesavo: yeah, but more validators seems to be necessary
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 eulerscheZahl: too much RNG otherwise
 struct: How many validators currently?
 eulerscheZahl: 46
 wlesavo: 5 for each length except 1  
 wlesavo: assign 5 actions for it anyway
 struct: Is there a validator limit?
 eulerscheZahl: dunnoCGFunge has 100 i think
 eulerscheZahl: and people still solve another problem that has nothing to do with prime numbers
 wlesavo: i dunno, the only reason i had 10 in first version is because i saw an advice in docs that validators should match the test cases
 wlesavo: and took it literally
 eulerscheZahl: that's mainly for puzzles
 struct: Maybe for puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/11-puzzle">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/11-puzzle</a>even this one has a different amount of testcases and validators

 KaneT: I use lua and C# but am not perfect in either. I can code what i need to for certain things in lua and C# but i,m not very good
 wlesavo: struct how many you have now?
 ThunderbirdOne: c# is a pretty decent first language
 struct: 0
 wlesavo: lol
 struct: Its for CSB
 eulerscheZahl: no way to get 1M
 struct: ofc there is
 struct: with AVX
 KaneT: What is C# used for mostly?
 reCurse: I used to do 1.4M with no eval, but that was also back when it was 150ms I think
 reCurse: So was nice knowing you
 struct: Oh no no
 struct: But I saw Marchet 3.5 mill with 150 ms
 eulerscheZahl: he will return with a new account anyways
 ThunderbirdOne: KaneT you can use C# to build websites, batch programs, you can write games with it (Unity), ...
 ThunderbirdOne: it's a pretty broad language
 ThunderbirdOne: same goes for Java i guess
 ThunderbirdOne: and Python
 KaneT: Oh wow i didnt know you could do websites with C#
 ThunderbirdOne: i've been doing just that for the past 8 years :p
 wlesavo: google asp.net
 reCurse: Isn't it all .net core now
 ThunderbirdOne: if you're going in fresh, best to start googling for aspnetcore :p
 ThunderbirdOne: it's going that way... but .net framework is still around
 ThunderbirdOne: next version will be just ".NET 5" (which will be core)
 ThunderbirdOne: and .NET framework will be kept at 4.7.2 or 4.8 or something, and will only receive critical bugfixes
 reCurse: Oh yeah I forgot about that
 reCurse: ffs ms
 ThunderbirdOne: :P
 ThunderbirdOne: they're getting better at it though :p
 reCurse: I've been saying that for years, they need to fire their entire marketing department and start over
 reCurse: They're so bad at it it's not even funny
 ThunderbirdOne: that new xbox name&#160;:')
 reCurse: Yeah
 ThunderbirdOne: xbox series x
 ThunderbirdOne: what?
 Astrobytes: lol seriously
 reCurse: xbox one was already retarded
 struct: lol
 ThunderbirdOne: then xbox one x
 ThunderbirdOne: in any case... they had .NET fw... and then introduced dotnetcore
 Astrobytes: BoxX Series One next presumably
 ThunderbirdOne: then they made dotnet standard (which was to bridge the gap)
 ThunderbirdOne: now they're gonna end .net fw
 reCurse: Their codenames are cooler
 reCurse: Like xbox one is durango
 ThunderbirdOne: and go on core :p
 ThunderbirdOne: so dotnetstandard has become useless :D
 Astrobytes: They should keep the codenames
 reCurse: Win10 was redstone
 reCurse: etc
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah
 reCurse: So much better
 ThunderbirdOne: i remember the GameCube was codename 'Dolphin'
 Astrobytes: the GameCube lol
 eulerscheZahl: and win10 isn't even win10 in their internal versioning
 eulerscheZahl: 6.3 or something like that
 ThunderbirdOne: same thing for Visual studio :p
 ThunderbirdOne: Visual Studio 2019 is what ... VS20&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Must be a real easy codebase to work with...
 eulerscheZahl: in 2010 it matched
 reCurse: VS15
 ThunderbirdOne: I absolutely love the new Windows Terminal though
 reCurse: It is a piece of work
 ThunderbirdOne: and wsl2 is pretty damn great too
 reCurse: Not released yet no?
 eulerscheZahl: new?win10 or even newer?
 ThunderbirdOne: not officially
 reCurse: Yeah I'll wait for official release
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah
 ThunderbirdOne: wsl makes docker so much easier :p
 reCurse: I can run my bots faster under it, then when I need a non-retarded debugging experience I switch to VS
 reCurse: It's the best of both worlds
 ThunderbirdOne: :D
 ThunderbirdOne: agreed
 struct: I miss VS, I think Im going to switch back
 Astrobytes: From what?
 struct: im using ubuntu atm
 struct: so no VS
 eulerscheZahl: there is VS code
 Astrobytes: Debugging on linux is like punching yourself in the face repeatedly
 Astrobytes: Compared to VS at least
 eulerscheZahl: you don't like gdb?

 eulerscheZahl: cows and bulls leaderboard resetnow i'm stuck at 97% correctness&#160;:/
 reCurse: Must be the validator
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl which one you failing? or is it different every time?
 eulerscheZahl: 43 and 45 mostly
 eulerscheZahl: validators are random generated when you submit @reCurse
 eulerscheZahl: to avoid hardcodingand i'm timing out
 reCurse: An optim game with rng?
 reCurse: That sounds fun
 reCurse: ...
 wlesavo: hm, they have different amount of bulls and cows, although 45 and 46 is the same
 eulerscheZahl: 0 bulls, 10 cows?
 wlesavo: 3 7
 eulerscheZahl: with static validators it would be too easy to hardcode
 wlesavo: true
 eulerscheZahl: but now there is a lot of randomness in submits
 reCurse: Well no shit
 eulerscheZahl: 298..324 (subtracting the 301 from failed validator)
 eulerscheZahl: that's 10%

 reCurse: Yeah I know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: talking to
 reCurse: Annoying as hell but when conversation is happening it's crossing the line
 eulerscheZahl: i hate the bots in generaldie Automatons
 Astrobytes: One advantage to discord at least, can review convos
 tekki: why?
 reCurse: Because you're preventing conversation from happening with your nonsense
 reCurse: You're abusing the bots
 PatrickMcGinnisII: because they know eulerscheZahl intimately

 struct: Someone crashed it maybe?
 wlesavo: works for me
 dbdr: wlesavo kept it all for themselves&#160;;)
 Stigma: hmmm
 wlesavo: oh nwm, also 500
 eulerscheZahl: i tried to update the puzzle list just now, i guess that crashed it
 Stigma: wheew
 eulerscheZahl: it's back
 Stigma: indeed
 Stigma: thanks!
 Stigma: and now i understand that my algo sucx
 eulerscheZahl: hm, CG API changedso i failed to download a puzzle and corrupted my DB
 Stigma: ew
 Stigma: that is scary
 AntiSquid: is it changing just for the sake of changing?
 eulerscheZahl: and it was the bulls and cows contribution where it failed

 Marchete: hello bobby tables
 eulerscheZahl: i have this in my DB: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/833872e6-6061-4754-b305-8304568cbe37">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/833872e6-6061-4754-b305-8304568cbe37</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and was looking for some keys that always exist on other entries
 wlesavo: how can that be?
 AntiSquid: you can clean the DB no?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 eulerscheZahl: but first i want to see what part of the API changed
 wlesavo: maybe it is due to check box make available to the community
 eulerscheZahl: no, i downloaded bitrunner too
 eulerscheZahl: just CG changing the website i guess
 eulerscheZahl: my downloader uses getContributionbut it got renamed to findContribution
 Marchete: fix your bulls and cows euler
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd, just below you
 Marchete: wow, fast :D
 eulerscheZahl: 100% correct this time, but bad score
 eulerscheZahl: 298 + 1 missing validator before
 eulerscheZahl: so about 310 i guess, maybe even better
 Marchete: noice
 eulerscheZahl: sad
 Marchete: I never went below 320
 eulerscheZahl: had 316 before the reset
 [CG]Thibaud: THanks Visual
 Sreejith8a: :rage:
 AntiSquid: greetings Sreejith8a
 Pouria2100: hi there
 Pouria2100: i'm back
 AntiSquid: why are you upset? Sreejith8a
 AntiSquid: welcome back Pouria2100
 Pouria2100: :TANKS:
 AntiSquid: where?
 Pouria2100:&#160;:|
 AntiSquid: martial law?
 Pouria2100: thanks
 Pouria2100: i said THANKS
 Pouria2100: ok?
 AntiSquid: ok :p
 Astrobytes: chill Winston
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 he said THANKS ok? IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
 Automaton2000: and if you see a lot of fun
 MadKnight: hey Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hi MadKnight
 MadKnight: how's your free time&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Variable as always
 MadKnight: variable free time&#160;?
 MadKnight: is that a type&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 MadKnight: use your free time to improve your CSB Astrobytes
 MadKnight: are u gonna make a NN&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No.
 AntiSquid: madao why didn't you improve yours?
 AntiSquid: i mean there's even a smitsi guide for it
 reCurse: Fix it maddie
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 AntiSquid: wasn't trying to poke fun, just really curious at this point
 AntiSquid: he redid his bot in haskell and ruby if i remember correctly, but then why wouldn't he redo it following some of the newer guides
 Astrobytes: Boredom?
 AntiSquid: then he wouldn't mention CSB
 Astrobytes: Yeah but it's just a meme
 AntiSquid: but the joke is on him .
 AntiSquid: only cyberpunk would repeat something that makes him look weird
 PatrickMcGinnisII: argh! lookup table of 83k is too too big for CG!!!  argh!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth, ide only accepts the first 17554 characters for code??????
 eulerscheZahl: or you use it wrong
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/13723842-99ce-4cc1-950f-8e86fbd0cd8d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/13723842-99ce-4cc1-950f-8e86fbd0cd8d</a>
 AntiSquid: how many spaces&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, cut past cut it off
 eulerscheZahl: now i found a major performance improvement for the bulls gamebut i can't submit because i spammed too much before
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: ah you can't set up locally
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/832/">https://xkcd.com/832/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: right now my problem is that i'm very close to the time limit, sometimes beyond
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ok, I'm not getting code length errors, but ide stops parsing code...changing colors and recognizing stuff after 17k
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, this is my optimal move array
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439414020">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439414020</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: wow
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl moin
 Zenoscave: FINALLY 100% on bnc2
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 eulerscheZahl: bnc?
 Zenoscave: bulls 'n' cows
 eulerscheZahl: i have this brilliant strategy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439414864">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439414864</a>
 eulerscheZahl: rotate tail, while first digit is static
 eulerscheZahl: count total bulls
 eulerscheZahl: then i can tell if the first digit is correct
 Zenoscave: interesting
 Zenoscave: I just filter on predicate
 Zenoscave: same code for all lengths
 eulerscheZahl: same, the replay above is horribly inefficient
 eulerscheZahl: 1. generate all possible numbers
 eulerscheZahl: 2. print random number
 eulerscheZahl: 3. filter possible numbers by given result
 eulerscheZahl: 4 . go to 2.
 Zenoscave: same
 eulerscheZahl: took me a while to fit that in 1s for setup and 50ms for later turns
 Zenoscave: I have to stop my filter short.
 eulerscheZahl: your 400+ score is too high for that strategy, hmm
 Zenoscave: it works for full sets up to length 7 and would timeout some 8 and all 9/10
 eulerscheZahl: should be around 330 when you don't stop
 Zenoscave: ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh ide doesn't like the lack of newlines over 16k chars
 eulerscheZahl: complains go to the ACE editor team
 reCurse: Just switch to monaco
 reCurse:  /s
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues">https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well i got over the code size hurdle, then I got confused about wth was going on. 
 Zenoscave: reCurse how do you profile C code? valgrind kcachegrind?
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl that replay looks like safe cracking in 90s movies
 reCurse: ETW
 Zenoscave: etw?
 reCurse: aka windows
 Zenoscave: Ah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: split lookup table into 44 lines, now ide likes me again
 Zenoscave: seems all my time is spent evaluating bulls and cows
 Zenoscave: like how many each string would have
 eulerscheZahl: my bottleneck was creating numbers in the first 1s
 Zenoscave: that's simple
 eulerscheZahl: my guesses are int[], not string
 Zenoscave: that might help
 Zenoscave: do you have to format numbers to certain length `n` in print?
 eulerscheZahl: and in the 1s i create numbers and already group by bulls/cows for by first guess
 Zenoscave: smart
 eulerscheZahl: for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) cout &lt;&lt; nums[i];
 wlesavo: wow
 wlesavo: thats a good idea
 Zenoscave: so an individual guess is a int[]?
 eulerscheZahl: in turn 2 and 3 i do the same, so i have 2 turns for the next filtering step
 eulerscheZahl: filtering half of the remaining candidates each turn
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, a guess is int[]
 eulerscheZahl: finally above Marchete again
 MadKnight: &gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) cout &lt;&lt; nums[i]; using for for that is so 2016
 Zenoscave: hiya maddy
 eulerscheZahl: for (int i&#160;: nums)is that what you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: or did i miss a new c++ feature?
 MadKnight: hmm for example
 MadKnight: std::for_each
 MadKnight: just throw print() as argument
 HackerI: anynoe know how to find possible leg lengths from hypotonuse
 HackerI: theres no angle so i cant use the sine and cosine
 eulerscheZahl: there must be some more info
 HackerI: like is there any way to find possible solutions?
 HackerI: ik its not possible to find onw
 HackerI: one*
 eulerscheZahl: say you know hypothenuse c
 eulerscheZahl: then you define a &lt; c
 eulerscheZahl: and b = sqrt(c*c - a*a)
 eulerscheZahl: without any angles that's all you can do
 HackerI: so an algebra solver?
 HackerI: like a system of equations
 eulerscheZahl: pythagoras: a²+b² = c²
 eulerscheZahl: just 1 equation
 eulerscheZahl: thus multiple solutions
 HackerI: oki i got to start working before my time runs out
 eulerscheZahl: you need an additional condition like an angle to get a single solution
 HackerI: that wold have ben too easy
 HackerI: ok i got it, used a random number generator and just cheacked the awnsers
 AntiSquid: lol wtf tabs crash a lot
 AntiSquid: i just finished writing quite a bit =&gt; crash
 HackerI: f
 AntiSquid: f
 eulerscheZahl: writing in chat or IDE?
 eulerscheZahl: if IDE, which game?
 AntiSquid: obv writing in chat gets me worked up
 AntiSquid: i get tab crashes for any game, randomly
 eulerscheZahl: some games are quite resource hungry, when you have them open
 AntiSquid: but i didn't check last battles in a long time
 AntiSquid: well not since last refresh due crash
 Zenoscave: how do you score to compare euler?
 Zenoscave: here comes dbdr
 Zenoscave: whoa
 dbdr: 🎲
 Zenoscave: random?
 dbdr: well, the validators are
 Zenoscave: eh?
 Zenoscave: they change?
 dbdr: they use rng to set the secret
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/ClcMru.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/ClcMru.jpg</a>
 dbdr: how many subs eulerscheZahl Marchete?&#160;:)
 devspy11: Hello 
 devspy11: who is online
 devspy11: lets compete
 MadKnight: at what
 MadKnight: at CoC&#160;?
 AntiSquid: devspy11 CSB&#160;?
 wlesavo: dbdr how many :game_die: rolls already?
 dbdr: 10
 reCurse: I think MSmits hired darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo: i wonder how it could be more resub proof besides more tests obviously. one way is to not have a secret till the very end but i duuno about policy of choosing b/c vals at each guess then 
 darkhorse64: My rates are high
 Astrobytes: Submission rates? :P
 YurkovAS: darkhorse64 in yavalath before openbook what place you have?
 dbdr: wlesavo you could keep changing the secret as long as it's possible
 darkhorse64: I have no opening book
 wlesavo: yeah, that would be a solution
 wlesavo: that would ruin the replays though
 dbdr: cannot you generate the replay at the end?
 dbdr: hm, probably not
 wlesavo: oh, well i guess you dont need replays for valudators
 dbdr: right
 wlesavo: didn't think about that
 YurkovAS: darkhorse64 thanks. top10+ much stronger.
 dbdr: oh, RoboStac submitted in Rust&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 it's at least a few minutes since your last submit, what are you waiting for? :P
 reCurse: Stroke
 AntiSquid: is there a rock paper scissor element in that game?
 reCurse: MSmits claims so
 reCurse: I'm not 100% sure
 Astrobytes: Perfect play should result in a draw, for the real game at least
 darkhorse64: Ankle injury. Switching hand ....
 AntiSquid: uhm
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: check where your ankles are
 reCurse: They didn't solve CG's version
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 AntiSquid: wrote his bot with his feet i guess
 darkhorse64: Bad english. Wrist
 Astrobytes: I preferred the first statement, my kind of humour
 AntiSquid: and a thumb like toe
 darkhorse64: My english is not suitable for anything else than computing. Throw me into a restaurant and I'll starve because I can't understand the menu
 AntiSquid: depends on the restaurant, there's sometimes free bread and butter just until you decide what to get
 MadKnight: u dunno any dishes words&#160;?
 Waffle3z: try CalM
 MadKnight: just order some Waffle3z
 AntiSquid: deep fry them
 darkhorse64: Pleased to make you laugh. I did too when I realized my mistake. Food in restaurant use a completely different  vocabulary
 reCurse: Worst that can happen is you order chicken wings and get chicken ankles instead.
 Astrobytes: hahaha oh dear
 MadKnight: u gotta love chicken ankles Automaton2000
 AntiSquid: ah you mean the overly pretentious description on the menu to make the dish sound more sophisticated than it really is?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 it's true
 Automaton2000: can you do a lot of work
 AntiSquid: pork wings
 darkhorse64: reCurse: there is more to eat
 Astrobytes: Although if you're in London darkhorse64, then chances are the  restaurant has at least 1 French or French-speaking person in there
 Astrobytes: Especially if it's a good restaurant
 darkhorse64: Yes, it solved my problem many times and It's always nice to talk to a cute French girl
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: what if it's an amazing spanish / italian restaurant, why the french speaker?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid darkhorse64 is French
 AntiSquid: i get that but you said a good restaurant has a french speaking member of staff
 darkhorse64: "Pasta" will always save you
 AntiSquid: sign language .
 AntiSquid: point your finger to your widely open mouth
 Astrobytes: Yes, most good restaurants of any nationality have multilingual staff
 reCurse: More restaurants should follow the japanese model
 reCurse: Just have plastic models of all the food you have
 reCurse: It's amazing and breaks barriers
 Astrobytes: And then recreate it exactly. Down to the nearest atom.
 Astrobytes: Which they do pretty well.
 darkhorse64: AntiSquid: I meant no relationship between quality and french staff
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 that comment was a reply to my earlier comment
 darkhorse64: YurkovAS: Looking at the Yavalath leaderboard, I understand your concern. A 4 point gap between #10 and #11
 reCurse: #banopeningbooks
 YurkovAS: darkhorse64 Game strategy have some tricks. It remains to find them or see in replays :smiley:
 darkhorse64: If you want to improve your bot, you need heavy (= smart) rollouts. It helps a lot
 darkhorse64: Don't ban me. I have just coded steal moves
 darkhorse64: Hard coding first move is legal
 SakuraLion: Hi Guys - I've been solving puzzles and I believe I have a solution; however, I'm getting a process has timed out error&#160;:( 
 SakuraLion: does that mean I have to optimize the code?
 AntiSquid: yes
 SakuraLion: T.T
 SakuraLion: Damn
 AntiSquid: life is cruel
 SakuraLion: Indeed
 SakuraLion: now that I think about it Big O (n^2) is pretty bad haha
 tekki: Big UP AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: which one will be a programmer&#160;?
 Zenoscave: timeouts on new version
 Zenoscave: but looks like i can compete for 1st once I fix them
 Astrobytes: BnC?
 Zenoscave: yes
 Astrobytes: I suck at combinatorics&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: permutations and trampolines&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: trampolines?
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189725/what-is-a-trampoline-function">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189725/what-is-a-trampoline-function</a>
 Zenoscave: allows to do lazy iterators and such in c
 Zenoscave: FP approach
 Astrobytes: aha, thank you!
 DarkMutant_2b60: The Decent game need to be improved.It is too easy if i use a LinkedList.Actually,i only use 10 lines to finish it.:expressionless:
 Z_Doctor: I used 3 :thinking:

 Marchete: or just recode all to use int pointers to big arrays
 BrunoFelthes: yeah.. in one day i will not be able to do it... So, low legend is enough... no MCTS for me&#160;:/
 BrunoFelthes: i think thta MCTS is the best search... what the top players are using?
 Marchete: how do you manage simultaneous?
 UndercoverToad: they don't tell
 struct:&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: val growth tweeted something about DUCT
 Marchete: in multi I'd try smitsi
 struct: I read duct but I discarded it
 Marchete: right now I can't make a GROW move score better than wait....
 Kellthazar: I think that they are using some kind of witchcraft.
 BrunoFelthes: I dont manage Marchete
 struct: I dont have enough time to implement it
 Marchete: how not Bruno
 Marchete: MCTS must be some kind of simultaneous
 BrunoFelthes: I do my play, and then the opponent play... If i use a seed space, the opponent cant use...
 Marchete: either linear with sim each two levels
 BrunoFelthes: it is close enough
 Marchete: or DUCT/smitsi/UCT forest
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/79558fe5-12e0-46e5-9134-40c208026c3b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/79558fe5-12e0-46e5-9134-40c208026c3b</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BrunoFelthes i tried seed blocking, wasted my time
 BrunoFelthes: but i think that simultaneous with intesection is too rare, it is not so hard to implement it at a normal MCTS tree...
 Marchete: in C# Zeno?
 Zenoscave: yes MArchete
 Zenoscave: there's a syntax issue. I'm aware
 Marchete: struct Move	{		unsafe public fixed ulong trees[4,2];	}
 Marchete: probably, I should check at tech.io
 UndercoverToad: shouldn't [,] be faster than [][]?
 Zenoscave: No idea
 Marchete: this struct is C++ like
 UndercoverToad: [][] is an array of arrays
 BrunoFelthes: the think that you can do simultaneous is seed and complete, that i think that is easy to manage... If you opponent chop a tree, just check the node before it, if it is a tree chop too, add one point...
 Marchete: you don't need new
 UndercoverToad: [,] is a 2D array, just an abstraction of 1 big array
 UndercoverToad: less indirection
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 struct: For completes I store the gain on the action itself
 UndercoverToad: [][] is called "jagged array"
 Kiat: c# here i also using [,]
 Zenoscave: And how do you populate one 2D array from another?
 Whiskee: I have a precalculated bool[,,,,] Shadow for all sizes, please send help
 Zenoscave: other = arr.Clone as ulong[,];&#160;???
 UndercoverToad: Array.Copy I think
 Kiat: ya
 UndercoverToad: not sure if it handles 2D
 Zenoscave: so not clone
 UndercoverToad: no
 Marchete: copy?
 Kiat: copy faster
 Marchete: Array.Copy probably, yes
 Marchete: if you want super ugly C#
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/abf34db9-0116-4512-82a1-557178fe92d9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/abf34db9-0116-4512-82a1-557178fe92d9</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BrunoFelthes i guess testing seed bounce is just a memcompare on boardstates
 Marchete: m and m2 are different
 Zenoscave: unsafe ugly is fine. Need a bit more sims I think.
 Marchete: so m2=m; is deep copy
 Zenoscave: got it. thanks
 Zenoscave: for 2D array in Array.Copy I would do 8 elements not 4?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: just try it and see&#160;;)
 Marchete: also a lot of:
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4c27ca56-50cd-44a3-a031-72880a8611c4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4c27ca56-50cd-44a3-a031-72880a8611c4</a>
 Marchete: knowing how to copy, you can copy full structs as a whole
 Zenoscave: why is there a void pointer in c# That's awful
 Zenoscave: I don't like that.
 Zenoscave: I feel gross
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: it's dirty
 Zenoscave: very
 Marchete: but instead of manually copying 20 fields
 Marchete: ok ok
 Marchete: nvm it's really ugly
 Zenoscave: If only I could figure out how to make a struct work with my Fast Priority queue. I need a class sadly
 Zenoscave: but this giives me enough to improve I think
 Marchete: class { struct k;}
 Marchete: but it's ugly too
 Zenoscave: you are getting too good at ugly C#
 Marchete: I'm corrupted by C++
 Marchete: before C++ I never liked pointers or arrays or similar
 Marchete: so don't do it
 Lysk: CouscousAgha I just pushed you
 Lysk: also 5H4dy
 CouscousAgha: I love you Lysk
 Lysk: :blush:
 CouscousAgha: i was tempted to resubmit
 CouscousAgha: and you came with the clutch
 Lysk: it was my pleasure, I hope I get to legend too
 CouscousAgha: im cheering for u
 ClockSort: aaugh i resubmitted and missed the help of Lysk
 CouscousAgha: Lysk clutched it
 Lysk: tiraptor also helping!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d05f96f9-bfbf-4a1e-b2c4-c337081dad5f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d05f96f9-bfbf-4a1e-b2c4-c337081dad5f</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: does that work?
 ClockSort: :eyes:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess not
 PatrickMcGinnisII: been awhile
 Lysk: yay
 CouscousAgha: welcome to legend Lysk
 Marchete: see? that's pure evil uglyness
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :thermometer_face:
 CouscousAgha: This is my first ever CG challenge and I managed to get to Legend with only heuristic 
 CouscousAgha: I think that's a cool achievement 
 Kellthazar: Indeed
 UndercoverToad: and now even another toad entered the game
 Marchete: who?
 UndercoverToad: around rank 20, daiver
 UndercoverToad: known from topcoder
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: it's like the evil toad
 UndercoverToad: according to ceg i'm the evil toad
 UndercoverToad: so that guy must be the good twin
 Marchete: like in evil bart :D
 UndercoverToad: but then i'd have a giant scar on my side
 Marchete: :eyes:
 aCat: morning euler&#160;;-)
 UndercoverToad: hi
 aCat: yesterday I couldn't do anything with code
 aCat: today I should have time
 aCat: final straight
 UndercoverToad: done with reviews?
 aCat: yeah
 aCat: 6 in one day
 aCat: damn
 UndercoverToad: that was fast
 UndercoverToad: my prof needed at least to months for my master thesis
 aCat: I've read some papers before but didn't wrote the revir=ews down
 aCat: papers are short&#160;;]
 aCat: and most of them crap
 aCat: one was good
 UndercoverToad: so just one to be published?
 aCat: and 2 out of 4 reviewers were negative talking about author doing something with MCTS
 aCat: while the paper was NOT about MCTS but NRPA
 UndercoverToad: what's wrong with MCTS?
 UndercoverToad: ah. would have to read about NRPA to see how far that is off
 aCat: th point is there were 'confident' reviews that didn't get that the algo is different
 aCat: quite
 aCat: single player
 aCat: it uses monte carlo pleyauts ofc
 aCat: but otherwise meh
 aCat: no idea about the final decisions made by the chairs yet
 aCat: regard=ing acc/rejection
 aCat: but really the reviewing system is strange / unfair and really random
 UndercoverToad: because reviewers aren't always experts in that field?
 aCat: thets only a pertial problem
 aCat: you evaluate your confidence, not only score
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea567375-08c5-48f6-a382-4aa23079bcaa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea567375-08c5-48f6-a382-4aa23079bcaa</a>
 aCat: but people tend to claim they are expersts
 aCat: and also have different meaning of scores
 aCat: you san see very similar review as text
 aCat: and oune sais weak accept, and other strong reject
 Zenoscave: I have a very flat scoring system for inner day moves I realized
 Zenoscave: Most of my top scores are equal as long as the same moves are applied in a day
 Zenoscave: What's the best way to get around this? turn decay?
 Numby: top player in legend is 10 score above 2nd O.o (reCurse at 42, 2nd player at 33)
 Numby: O.o
 Zaphus: oh, look at that... when I stop accessing arrays past their bounds, I jump from ~800th to ~500th&#160;:-)  I can't even work out how I got that high with such broken code!
 miklla: reCurse vs the world&#160;: 142 - 5
 Numby: that's insane I thought the game was super close at top positions and everyone plays close to optimal
 Zenoscave: Close. but recurs_e is closer
 JohnCM: i've come to ignore reviewers, especially those who give irrelevant comments
 JohnCM: does more harm than good listening to non-constructive feedback anyway
 JohnCM: hmm... how to beat gold boss with heuristics
 JohnCM: i'm at 10 pts difference from gold boss alr
 JohnCM: now just need to code some useful stuff
 Westicles: Wow, team North America takes a big lead
 NinjaDoggy: wait is this real?
 NinjaDoggy: reCurse is 9 points ahead of second? -_-
 NinjaDoggy: reCurse explaing yourself -_-
 NinjaDoggy: explain*
 aCat: JohnCM you can ignore them, but if they decide your paper is rejected and you have nowhere to shout that they make mistakes it is frustrating
 JohnCM: indeed, but you got to believe in yourself. surely there's another venue to submit to
 Zenoscave: I really broke my bot. I can't find the right eval anymore
 NinjaDoggy: Recurse is like an alien racing coming to earth and teaching us plebians how to really play chess&#160;:)
 JohnCM: go history and get your previous code
 aCat: this si problem if youre forced to aim for top conferences
 aCat: otherwise its not much a big deal
 Zenoscave: JohnCM There's 201 submits...
 Zenoscave: I can't remember which was best
 JohnCM: wow. time to start from scratch, maybe you'll code something better
 Zenoscave: Seeing how I'm in legend I doubt it&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: I'm going to recode after watching a few hundred recurse replays&#160;;)
 JohnCM: haha legend is good enough tbh
 Zenoscave: not enough time left in competition
 Marchete: WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.google.inject.internal.cglib.core.$ReflectUtils$2
 JohnCM: i have a feeling recurse didn't do heuristics
 NinjaDoggy: the game is supposed to be played completely differently apparently&#160;;)
 Marchete: what's that error in my mvn brutaltester?
 NinjaDoggy: I feel like the only way was he did some NN stuff&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: what jdk are you using?
 NinjaDoggy: otherwise gap shouldn't be this massive
 JohnCM: if NN will be quite impressive
 JohnCM: you have to test it locally and then port the weights over
 Westicles: Naw, probably smitsimax with lots of booking
 NinjaDoggy: no way it's smitsi...
 NinjaDoggy: maybe simul MCTS
 JohnCM: haha if codingame has a tensorflow/pytorch support library, i would use NN too
 Marchete: it seems the referee
 JohnCM: but don't think codingame wants to go that direction
 Numby: prolly too many people would go for NN if there was an easy way to do it
 Numby: yeah that would be not as interesting
 Marchete: hmm, why not?
 Zenoscave: They had mnist as a medium problem once upon a time
 Marchete: I mean
 JohnCM: i actually kinda like the fact that heuristics can get gold
 Marchete: the point is creating the best AI bot
 NinjaDoggy: who has the best muZero clone contest&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Yup. My bot'll be bottom barrel legend&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: probably shouldn't be in legend at all
 NinjaDoggy: legend is legend&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: no difference until top 20&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: fair
 NinjaDoggy: and it's never over until the last day :D
 SterlingA: Do you guy know any heuristic bot in legend&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: I'm exhausted. I've done easily 100 hours
 JohnCM: this comp i took a diff strategy. i coded till bronze, took a weeks' break, then came back over the weekend
 JohnCM: good to have the silver and gold bosses ready for the benchmarking
 Zenoscave: I keep forgetting to eat
 PaarthThePro: No way!
 Marchete: Zenoscave, do you know what can cause this?

 ddreams: Marchete too new java
 ddreams: get java8
 NinjaDoggy: you link me his twitter but I can't find a tweet about recurse&#160;:(
 Marchete: thanks ddreams
 NinjaDoggy: it's also not translated to english&#160;:(
 ddreams: wow 41.13 vs second place of 32.79
 ddreams: that's impressive
 Marchete: I love how Java is so incompatible between versions. C# lacks that and I'm furious
 UndercoverToad: re curse was called an "extraterrestrial" if I can trust deepl
 Westicles: Ask him his approach and he'll be as forthcoming as one of those arrival hexapods
 Westicles: *heptapods
 Marchete: on brutaltester "Negative score during game 1 p0:-1"&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: a crash
 UndercoverToad: or timeout
 ddreams: start the game without brutaltester and see
 ddreams: depends on the referee, you may have one that does not give you possibleactions
 ddreams: or you're playing in wood league
 JohnCM: if only codingame has a library like OpenAI, where you can env.step() all your actions without coding out the entire environment haha
 JohnCM: then monte carlo will be easier
 UndercoverToad: how does that work with local testing?
 Marchete: it seems crashes, yes
 Marchete: but if I run on VSstudio
 Marchete: there is none
 UndercoverToad: i tend to have an
 Marchete: nvm
 Marchete: I'm more stupid that I can even imagine
 Marchete: I compiled DEBUG and not release
 OBenjOne: I had almost no time to work on this challenge... It would be nice to make it to legend though
 UndercoverToad: hah, I got what's wrong&#160;:)
 Marchete: and release was indeed crashing
 Marchete: yeah
 UndercoverToad: well, almost
 NinjaDoggy: on a side note, why use brutal tester instead of own arena? :P
 NinjaDoggy: (assuming you already have full sim)
 OBenjOne: what's brutaltester? Sorry I'm new to this
 OBenjOne: Should I be using it?
 UndercoverToad: program to help you test offline
 UndercoverToad: play a bunch of games, 2 program versions vs each other
 OBenjOne: That seems really useful, I'll look into it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can't believe i'm still finding bugs
 UndercoverToad: the more bugs you find, the more likely it is that you still have some more remaining
 PatrickMcGinnisII: was gonna expand depth, but bug would just make it worse
 dbdr: so there are infinitely many bugs UndercoverToad? :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: toad²
 UndercoverToad: don't use logic against me :D
 UndercoverToad: just quoting pretty much the only thing I remember from my software reliability class
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: reminds me of: for cheeses with holes in them, the more cheese you have, the more holes you have. and the more holes you have, the less cheese you have. so the more cheese you have, the less cheese you have
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so cheezy
 ddreams: makes sense
 ddreams: kind of like the companies that tell you "the more you spend, the more you save!"
 PaarthThePro: I like that quote
 PaarthThePro: The more I live the less I live
 PaarthThePro: I am immortal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ouch
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, rock out with your chicken out

 ddreams: board with ten holes: seed=8472451449982904300
 ddreams: actually 132 to 129, but I suspect it wasn't really close
 shitizen: 你们上班要996吗
 shitizen: you are so free
 ddreams: you are not?
 shitizen: do you start working at 9am to 9pm for six days?
 ddreams: often, but not because I am forced to
 ddreams: I get paid per hour, so I like to work a lot in periods and then take time off
 shitizen: that's a good idea
 UndercoverToad: I work 7:15am-3pm
 Bari: Hi
 NinjaDoggy: reCurse's sun effeciency early game is actually insane :O
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't see, post replay
 shitizen: how do you learn englishmy english is so poor and bad
 ddreams: when I was a kid, I played English games looking up everything in a dictionary
 shitizen: one word often include many meaning
 ddreams: practice
 shitizen: it's too hard to remember
 shitizen: i often look up the words that i don't know but after a while i forget what it is 
 ddreams: language has to be used, or you'll forget
 shitizen: you sent "take time off" just now.but i didn't know what it is until i translate it by online translater

 LelouchVC2: I'll make 1000 accounts and make them all top 1000
 LelouchVC2: Just to deprive you of that pleasure
 ddreams: too late, he's already dreaming about it
 LLG: ClockSort boutta hit legend
 jrke: wut reCurse 1st only under 24 h
 jrke: with 8 points lead
 jacek: legend on 1 submit or delete
 ddreams: #1 on 1 submit or delete
 jrke: is that NN
 UndercoverToad: we don't know
 jrke: but he made rank 1 under 15-16 h think
 UndercoverToad: but it's to be assumed that he was testing with an alt account before. he knew that this would be a #1 submit
 jrke: even less than that
 UndercoverToad: an impressive performance nontheless
 UndercoverToad: he won 2 contests before. but this is by far the most dominant win I can remember (among all contests, not only among his wins)
 jacek: if server kept down that would be quite a fail for him
 Westicles: not a win yet
 kovi: no way to beat nn
 jacek: i bet it is NNish
 UndercoverToad: the only thing that can stop him now is staff
 jacek: or some 9mms
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/reCurse">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/reCurse</a>
 UndercoverToad: nice, I even got the honor to play against him
 UndercoverToad: dropping his score by losing to him probably
 Westicles: Staff?  Like obfuscation ruling?
 UndercoverToad: i don't think it will happen
 UndercoverToad: just a deus ex machina that's more likely than any player beating him in the arena
 jacek: a modified game to make it sequential with known moves
 kovi: i was afraid of this gonna happen. game is too "simple", single search + "heuristics" (which within search can be best captured by nn)it kinda takes away motivation...today...and for long term as well
 jacek: thats why he waited so long&#160;:?
 davilla: are alt accounts legit here?
 derjack: ban
 dbdr: no
 UndercoverToad: they are not? :scream:
 dbdr: :D
 jacek: at least dont submit in contest
 dbdr: yeah
 VirtusDomo: god its hajrd to get momentum
 VirtusDomo: i swear i'm always stuck
 ddreams: ask recursive for tips, virtus
 ddreams: he's good at getting momentum
 VirtusDomo: recursive&gt;?
 davilla: well there's your deus ex
 davilla: banned account
 VirtusDomo: lol is that like a known thing here?
 VirtusDomo: im new
 ddreams: top player miles ahead of the rest
 VirtusDomo: ahhh i see i see
 ddreams: in one submit
 VirtusDomo: yeah i'm just trying to get good enough for internships lol
 davilla: I wouldn't ban the guy honestly, but maybe force him to use the other account
 davilla: well now I don't feel so bad for dropping out during wood
 ddreams: true, wood leagues were challenging
 davilla: it's more that I couldn't get my head in it, motivationally
 davilla: my program actually made it to silver without any further mods
 davilla: don't ask me how
 ddreams: I'm in legend and just found out I calculated resource points incorrectly
 davilla: sorry, I meant bronze
 ddreams: maybe fixing it will put me in top 100
 davilla: cool&#160;:)
 ddreams: anyway, gtg family stuff, bbl
 Selwyn: man I feel like I'm an intermediate developer but I can't even do any challenges here 
 Selwyn: I feel like I'm so badd bahaha

 UndercoverToad: Astrobytes would you be so kind?&#160;;)
 MSmits: it makes sense Astrobytes, a simple positional game like this seems right for an eval with NN. Just the input seems a bit hard to structure
 Astrobytes: My pleasure Toad.
 Astrobytes: MSmits. Yeah, I was thinking this. Will be interesting to hear about it.
 MSmits: we all find that this game is hard to eval, nn takes care of i
 MSmits: it
 MSmits: not saying that it's easy write a nn here, just saying it makes sense to do it if you can
 UndercoverToad: or it fails hard <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556411886">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556411886</a>
 Astrobytes: Yes, I agree MSmits
 UndercoverToad: but in 99% it's just overwhelming
 MSmits: weird that it would fail so hard
 dbdr: maybe it predicts a loss
 MSmits: yeah, all output close to 0, one loss being much like another, just by a different margin
 Astrobytes: Either way, I'm quite impressed
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: but not completely surprised tbh
 dbdr: that's why I find it more satisfying to optimize the margin
 Astrobytes: Yeah, same here Smits
 AntiSquid: are you sure it's NN&#160;?
 dbdr: but maybe win/loss has advantages
 MSmits: AntiSquid pretty sure
 MSmits: reCurs e doesnt do anything else these days
 MSmits: and the margin is insane
 Astrobytes: Which we know about from the other board game leads
 Astrobytes: *that he has/other NNs have
 AntiSquid: cool, then which type of algo, was looking at ReBeL just because of this contest
 MSmits: I do feel a bit sorry for the people leading the leaderboard before recurs e took it
 MSmits: i know the feeling from being wrecked by nn's on board games
 MSmits: bit hopeless
 Astrobytes: All's fair in love and CG Contests
 MSmits: sure, i just feel sorry for them i sall&#160;:)
 MSmits: empathy and all that sht
 kovi: thx
 Astrobytes: Oh for sure!
 AntiSquid: but . there's a HUGE chance it's not NN, for the simple fact that all you need to do is find right heuristics, so theoretically with decent data analysis you can just figure the right heuristics out
 AntiSquid: to get to legend at least
 UndercoverToad: i still don't get the hiding and last minute submit. isn't it a more fun experience without
 UndercoverToad:&#160;?
 MSmits: UndercoverToad probably he wanst sure his nn would succeed
 MSmits:  a poor nn migh tnot even get out of wood
 AntiSquid: hide until 1st place is secure lol
 MSmits: they are kind of all or nothing in a way
 UndercoverToad: i'm pretty sure he knew before the servers died yesterday
 MSmits: pretty sure he would have submitted if it would end top 10 :P
 MSmits: instead of 1
 UndercoverToad: i'll just wait for the post mortem instead of guessing any further
 MSmits: yeah, sure
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Should be a good read.
 LLG: e
 MSmits: gotta code some more, somewhat satisfied with top 100, but can do better maybe
 Pick8chu: Hey MSmits
 MSmits: hey Pick8chu, was just heading out
 AntiSquid: my win rate just drastically improved by adding 1 extra condition ... if i guess few more i will make it to legend with just that . 
 Pick8chu: oh
 dbdr: "maybe"
 Pick8chu: alright good luck man and congrats on 100
 MSmits: thanks, ttyl&#160;:)
 Pick8chu:&#160;:)
 Pick8chu: Would anyone give me some thoughts on improvement? 
 Pick8chu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556597597">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556597597</a>
 AntiSquid: add random heuristics and test
 UndercoverToad: seed on 9 is in your own shadow range
 Pick8chu: is it?
 UndercoverToad: wait, i was looking at blue
 Pick8chu: haha okay
 UndercoverToad: seed on 6 then
 UndercoverToad: 15 too
 Pick8chu: How could i apply random heuristics?
 UndercoverToad: when the tree grows to size 3, you have a problem
 Pick8chu: I complete them too early?
 Butanium: Hey
 UndercoverToad: yes, was about to say that
 Pick8chu: AntiSquid How could i apply random heuristics?
 UndercoverToad: and the positioning at 1 and 4 isn't optimal again
 Pick8chu: 1 and 4 you meant turn?
 Butanium: I want to do MCTS for the challenge and I'm thinking about making playout returning none discrete value depending on the score delta between the two players
 UndercoverToad: 2000 places doesn't mean much in a contest this size&#160;;)
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: UndercoverToad you used beam search right?
 Butanium: do you think that's a good idea?
 UndercoverToad: cell 1 and 4
 UndercoverToad: turn on debug mode
 MUkhtadirshaikh: hello word
 MUkhtadirshaikh: world
 UndercoverToad: yes, beam all the way
 Pick8chu: they have debug mode???
 UndercoverToad: settings, gear icon
 MUkhtadirshaikh: yup they have it
 Pick8chu: lmao
 UndercoverToad: even mentioned in the statement&#160;;)
 MUkhtadirshaikh: lets clash
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: did you have to limit the possible moves so that it was possible?
 UndercoverToad: i'm in this debug mode the whole contest already
 dbdr: there is a non-debug mode?
 UndercoverToad: some limitations on spawns to generate less states
 UndercoverToad: not going too much into detail during the contest
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yeah fair enough
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: will there be post-mortems after the contest finishes? I am interested to see how the legends did it
 UndercoverToad: yes, there are always some
 UndercoverToad: not sure if i'll write anything yet. my bot doesn't have any interesting thoughts in it
 jacek: so you copied your brain into it?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: surely a nice eval function or something
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: you are 11th
 Astrobytes: offf buuuuurn
 Astrobytes: jacek bringing the cheek
 UndercoverToad: that was inappropriate jacek
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes:  /kick
 UndercoverToad: i extended my board state and realized I forgot to add this field to hash+equals
 UndercoverToad: when adding it, the offline batch gets worse
 Astrobytes: lol
 UndercoverToad: maybe because the beam gets more narrow that way
 Pick8chu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556609594">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556609594</a>
 Pick8chu: Slightly better
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I realised when I was pruning I wasn't sorting beforehand so I changed it and it got worse
 jacek: username checks out
 BrunoFelthes: OMG reCurse started the contest with 94% win rate
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lol
 BrunoFelthes: this guy is insane
 UndercoverToad: no, he didn't. his wood bot wasn't impressive at all
 Butanium: do you think I could do any improvement on my heuristic?
 Butanium: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556555961">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556555961</a>
 Butanium: I'm about to switch to a MCTS but I won't have the time to siubmit it before the end
 Butanium: I'd like to end up in legend x)
 AntiSquid: then do heuristics instead LOL
 Pick8chu: AntiSquid how do you do that tho?
 Pick8chu: like generate random numbers and see if what gives you the best result?
 UndercoverToad: random actions you mean?
 Pick8chu: heuristics
 UndercoverToad: that can be an option. you still have to define how a good result looks like
 UndercoverToad: then i don't understand
 UndercoverToad: back to my code
 Pick8chu: how do you mean? you define what a good result is?
 Butanium: AntiSquid: Do you think I could improve my evaluation function without doing random search&#160;? x)
 AlMualem: guys what is the strategy to win the silver bot...(complete as fast as you can,complete the ones with the sallest index for more points,seed with distance &gt;=2 each tree from another...)any other thoughts?
 AlMualem: smallest index*
 particleflux: lol only just now realized that richer soil == smaller index
 cegprakash: reCurse 93% win rate in legend wow.. Nice way to troll everyone on legend. Looks like he cracked this contest.
 AlMualem: hahaha
 Pick8chu: that's jsut crazy lol
 AlMualem: i have implemented all these thoughts to my code and still can win silver bot in every match&#160;:(
 AlMualem: cant*
 actualCoderTrevor: Do you consider shadows?
 lionandmouse: try to maintain some trees for stable income in good positions and then farm. Shadows can be disregarded until gold.
 actualCoderTrevor: You can only get so far without doing that
 Sanguigno: lca
 AlMualem: i took them (the shadows) a little bit under consideration,,,i mean that is the reason i am seeding with distance greater or equal than 2
 TootiFlooti: what division are yall in
 AlMualem: whats left is to implement , is seeding in the smallest possible index
 TootiFlooti: im still working on getting to silver&#160;:(
 AlMualem: i am 222th on silver mate
 TootiFlooti: nice 
 TootiFlooti: i have a stable build and just waiting tto get thru bronze im beatingf everyone so far but sadly i was not able to work on this all week&#160;:(
 AlMualem: i am working as we speak :P
 TootiFlooti: im going to try to beat you almualem thats my new goal lol
 Pick8chu: AlMualem as far as I know, everyone here implemented with weights. Basically, among possible actions, what is the best option
 TootiFlooti: im to sleepy now ill work on it tomorrw
 TootiFlooti: goodnight all
 AlMualem: bb
 Pick8chu: good night man
 AlMualem: pIckachu? when we talk about best actions...regarding what?
 Pick8chu: let's say on one day you get grow and seed and complete and wait
 TootiFlooti: aslo quick question is there a prize for winning contest 
 TootiFlooti: im jsut doing it for practice 
 Pick8chu: among 4 of them, you weight them  using the information you have like sun, or shadows, or how much sun point i have 
 jacek: a dinner with chosen mod
 Pick8chu: and pick the biggest weight
 TootiFlooti: ty jacek
 k4ng0u: if you manage to beat reCurse, you will likely earn the respect of the whole community
 TootiFlooti: lmao
 Pick8chu: lol 
 Astrobytes: jacek :rofl:
 TootiFlooti: true i like that. respect like fast and furious classic
 AlMualem: pica pica i changed a number and now i have won the last 4 game scenarios against silver bot...that number indicated the number of trees i shoulf have on deck...and of after a certain day to stop stop seeding and try to grow and complete whats left
 michaelzlatkin1: How do you even get out of the first bronze league? It really just feels like the winner is determined by who gets the luckiest bump...
 KelvinAndHubbles: Woot Woot! 4 days hardstuck top 100 Silver, makes some tweaks every day and friken finally past it
 peerdb: michaelzlatkin1try seeding your new plants in gridlike patterns, so they dont block each others sunlight
 Pick8chu: Good job man!
 Pick8chu: KelvinAndHubbles congrats
 michaelzlatkin1: plants...?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556639948">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556639948</a> 2nd win, Automaton2000 give me some dumb ideas
 Automaton2000: how can i send a private message

 Automaton2000: i'm not a fast coder

 Whatar: it doesn't matter, we all know that you are the real OG Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i'm pretty sure it is the same as the other ones
 AlMualem: i am testing it right now in arena
 peerdb: Is there an easy way to check where the segfault happens in my code (c++)?
 Pick8chu: AlMualem looking good
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556639948">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556639948</a> making my bot dumber really helps
 CarbonBlack: Hi
 Pick8chu: i don't get why edge has benefits
 AlMualem: AntiSquid i see you are seeding a lot on the outskirts and win...first of all gj mate...second you thing its more important to complete first or complete (smaller index=more points?
 Pick8chu: *edges
 AlMualem: think*
 Mistblinde: Less shadows on the edge
 geppoz: edge of course have at least 1/2 of "a week" without shadows
 geppoz: mid can have all week shadow
 AlMualem: less shadows --&gt; more sun points---&gt;complete first...right?
 Pick8chu: hmm okay let me try that
 peerdb: yeah I was using my trees on the edges to farm sunpoints and the trees in the center to farm score
 nam4.nguyen: My first algo reach top 1k but after modifing something I feel make more sense, my new bot got worse rank. Idk why my first stupid bot can be that good&#160;:|
 Pick8chu: actually that's very good idea peerdb
 peerdb: :nerd:
 BlitzProg: I'm looking at mcts tutorials but there's something like "win amount divided simulation amount"
 BlitzProg: can I just replace "win" by something like my score?
 BlitzProg: maybe divide it by a number to keep it between 0 and 1
 AlMualem: my strategy is to first reach 6 trees at level 3 and complete the 2 with the smaller index(with this strategy i farm the ones closer to the center and let the rest to farm...after a certain day of the game i complete every tree i can starting from the ones that are already 3 level
 AntiSquid: i don't understand the questions, i just added some random heuristics
 Pick8chu: How do you do hat
 AlMualem: with my last submit i went from 222nd to 76 and still going (i am at 72%)
 AlMualem: until now i haven't battle the boss&#160;:/
 AlMualem: 56th at 76%
 MSmits: BlitzProg you can do that
 AlMualem: 22th at 79%
 MSmits: you dont need to keep it between 0 and 1 either, no point to that
 MSmits: just adjust your exploration parameter
 MSmits: until it explores properly
 BlitzProg: MSmits thanks20 hours lefts, never tried mcts but i'm so desperate lol
 MSmits: if your scores are between 50 and 100, your exploration parameter should be of the order of 50 or so
 MSmits: same if your scores are between 450 and 500
 MSmits: it's the score interval that matters
 MSmits: the size of it i mean
 BlitzProg: Oooh I see
 MSmits: but you do need to fit it, i am just giving you an estimate
 AntiSquid: Pick8chu, think of a random condition and write that into code. Here's the pseudocode:"if (something is true) then do this action."
 CrystallineCore: In coders strike back, sometimes my bot revolves around the same checkpoint multiple times before going to the next checkpoint. Is this the problem of my code?
 Pick8chu: Like super random?
 MSmits: CrystallineCore yes, you are overshooting it
 Pick8chu: Like if(tree_size = 2) seed?
 BlitzProg: Well, here goes nothing then, I'll spend some hours coding that and see what happens
 MSmits: you need to reduce speed or aim away from the checkpoint 
 MSmits: to correct for overshooting
 MSmits: BlitzProg mcts is pretty hard to debug, at leas that is my experience. It might take a while to start workinf
 MSmits: unlike something like beamsearch which could have some reasonable results fairly quickly
 Mazelcop: hello folks
 BlitzProg: Beam search requires an eval tho
 Mazelcop: anyone knows why my local CG referee starts each player twice&#160;?
 MSmits: BlitzProg yeah
 MSmits: well mcts does too, if the depth is too great
 AlMualem: DAAAAmn i finished 3rd....
 MSmits: how much rating below boss?
 AlMualem: and i played only once against the boss should i try again with the same code?
 peerdb: just wait AlMualem , you might get bumped up a spot or 2
 peerdb: what is the boss' arena score vs yours?
 AlMualem: the boss 43,59 me 42,79
 MSmits: if you are 2 pts or more below boss, you have no chance of that
 MSmits: that might be doable
 MSmits: resubmit i'd say
 peerdb: id wait 15 minutes
 MSmits: sure yeah
 wlesavo: depends on league
 AlMualem: why wait peerdb?
 BlitzProg: Stakes are higher for me this contest so I'm pretty willing to try many things to get into legend, but it has been hard
 peerdb: when other people play their matches they also play you, so it impacts your score.
 AlMualem: 43,62 the boss 42,96 me
 Nerchio: Mazelcop i didn't notice anything like this but i was timeouting a lot so maybe i have same problem i just didnt notice? :D
 BlitzProg: Since Monday nothing did better than what I sent that day
 AlMualem: ok i will wait
 peerdb: same goes for the boss,so you have a chance to win some matches while the boss loses and you go above him AlMualem
 AlMualem: i will wait 10 minutes
 peerdb: sure
 AlMualem: and submit the same code again?
 peerdb: thats up to you
 Sanguigno: elca
 VRtheKing: how to clear the quest called moderate a contribution
 AlMualem: if i submit the same code is there a chance to promote? i am 4th at the moment....43,36 the boss 42,96 me
 MSmits: there's a chance 
 MSmits: though hard to say how much of one
 MSmits: it depends a lot on other players and luck
 peerdb: perhaps you can get slightly better results by changing your strategy just a little (harvest earlier/later)
 AlMualem: i will submit one more time with the same code and if i dont promote i will test when its better to seed
 AnthonyHilala: comment voir le classement du boss&#160;? :s
 peerdb: okay good luck AlMualem
 AlMualem: mt difference with boss is 0,4
 AlMualem: ty mate
 peerdb: 0.4 is not much
 AlMualem: sorry for spamming i am ultra hyped right now
 ItsNotABug: wow, recurse has smashed legend
 peerdb: AlMualem how far below boss now?
 cegprakash: ppl in top legend be like.. oh noo it's time to switch to NN
 AlMualem: i promoteeeeeed automatically  :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
 peerdb: whoooo
 peerdb: congrats
 AlMualem: ty mate &lt;3
 AlMualem: i dont have a lot of experience in coding...but i am really into coding want to be a full stack developer one day
 Neon_Tuts: Hello World
 Zanoshky: Hello Neon
 AlMualem: hiiiiii
 The_ZimaBlue: can you guys check out:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/67177d35db600c4defaf302f9fdeea1f6c3f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/67177d35db600c4defaf302f9fdeea1f6c3f</a>
 cegprakash: what is the maximum number of possible actions that we can get in input
 cegprakash: numberOfPossibleActions has any upper limit
 AlMualem: there must be a max number because our map i limited but how can this be helpful?
 cegprakash: I generate possible moves and I care about memory :P
 cegprakash: I used 300 and it crashed some games
 solistice: 37 * 7 + I guess
 cegprakash: so I increased to 2000 now
 solistice: that's without thinking about stuff
 solistice: think 300 should suffice
 solistice: but that's not at all a calculated value
 AlMualem: why youdo you generate and not reading the input from possible_action list?
 cegprakash: for future turns
 cegprakash: for opponents
 cegprakash: things like that
 AlMualem: hm...i see...ok...so lets calculate it...
 AlMualem: you said you need it for the opponent move,not yours...right?
 cegprakash: for ours too during future turns
 cegprakash: when u simulate the future like Doctor Strange 
 AlMualem: ok ok for both
 AlMualem: ahahaha
 cegprakash: u can look 2million possible outcomes
 cegprakash: and choose the path with 1 winning outcome
 AlMualem: do you want to take under consideration the sun points? (i suppose yes)
 UndercoverToad: of course
 Pick8chu: So you try all the possible outcomes till your memory allows and decide on that?
 TobiasA: the only way for your bot to win is for it to use the infinity stones to snap the opponent away and die in the process
 Pick8chu: lol
 TobiasA: it really works
 Pick8chu: but how&#160;? that's just crazy
 TobiasA: doctor strange said it is the only way
 TobiasA: strange never lies
 Pick8chu: so you can have 7 boards so start try 7 possible ways?
 Sanguigno: elca
 solistice: 14 million possible outcomes
 solistice: only 1 is winning
 TobiasA: my bot found the reality stone:hushed:
 Pick8chu: could you help me to understand?
 UndercoverToad: there are many different ways what to do with the simulations. You have to ask the right question for a meaningful answer
 AntiSquid: Pick8chu what's your job role at samsung&#160;?
 TobiasA: first harvest all your trees and craft a gauntlet
 Pick8chu: web developing for now, as a full stack developer
 Pick8chu: I get how you should weight the possible actions
 AntiSquid: cool
 Pick8chu: but I don't get how to simulate with those actions and see what brings the best outcome
 TobiasA: wow you work at samsung
 AlMualem: so...depending on the number of the trees you own and their size.,,, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0f136a7d-8e71-4c78-b35d-590fd38684f8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0f136a7d-8e71-4c78-b35d-590fd38684f8</a>
 UndercoverToad: usually you don't weight actions but states
 UndercoverToad: start with a board, create all possible following boards
 Pick8chu: oh
 UndercoverToad: then rate these based on some criteria (game points, suns, ...)
 AntiSquid: Pick8chu try this page first&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Best-First">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Best-First</a>
 UndercoverToad: remove a few if there are too many (would get too slow)
 UndercoverToad: and further expand the rest
 UndercoverToad: that's basically how beam search works
 Pick8chu: AntiSquid thanks! 
 Cjx_1: Am starting to think like a sprite, I can see gold in sight! Its gonna be a good day :D
 Pick8chu: lvl 50? that's crazy
 Pick8chu: UndercoverToad okay thanks, i think i got what you meant a little
 Pick8chu: I'll have to measure the state not actions
 UndercoverToad: exactly
 AntiSquid: that toad has a level 55 account, who's crazy now?
 Pick8chu: wait what?
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Pick8chu: that's just crazy lol
 Pick8chu: hey
 Pick8chu: wait
 Pick8chu: that's the real one
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: chat gets laggy with my main account
 Pick8chu: that's why you are undercover toad!!!
 Pick8chu: LMAO
 UndercoverToad: i'm using the other one for the contest duration
 Cjx_1: out of curiousity (im running a pure heuristic bot) what do the states map to, integers or rationals?
 jacek: having frog avatar in french site :thinking:
 UndercoverToad: up to you, I have doubles
 Cjx_1: ^^ lol L'absurditie
 UndercoverToad: and chromium just asked me if i want to wait or kill the other tab
 AntiSquid: you think they'll stare at his legs jacek?
 Cjx_1: good will to live in that one
 UndercoverToad: they can eat daiver if they want
 Cjx_1: rofl
 struct: hi
 UndercoverToad: hi legendary struct
 struct: you didnt know euler?
 UndercoverToad: i did
 struct: ah 
 struct: thanks
 UndercoverToad: this will be your cognomen from now on
 UndercoverToad: until the next contest
 struct: lol
 struct: all it took was starting the contest 14 days earlier
 UndercoverToad: you can do that again if thibaud needs testers
 struct: probably wont do it again
 UndercoverToad: competing is more fun
 struct: yeah
 struct: on first days I had no motivation at all
 UndercoverToad: at least you did some testing, not like some other testers
 BrunoFelthes: how many testes cg have?
 struct: 4 + cg staff
 UndercoverToad: how many testers did submit?
 struct: all submited
 BrunoFelthes: i was a tester for 1 contest... I did a good code, but after this they never call me again
 struct: but a good ai?
 struct: 0
 struct: mine had 100% win rate
 UndercoverToad: which contest did you test bruno?
 struct: and i had a bot that had 99% win rate vs that one
 BrunoFelthes: the one with baracks... 
 UndercoverToad: code royale
 BrunoFelthes: this one
 UndercoverToad: so the other testers did the equivalent of getting stuck in wood?
 struct: all are &gt; 2000
 struct: ok above rank 2000
 Noyotens: my rank is 1659 TH
 struct: The names are on the forum I think
 Noyotens: THIS IS GOOD RANK&#160;??
 UndercoverToad: depends on your goals
 Noyotens: MY GAL IS TO BE WITH FIRST 1000
 Cjx_1: THEN, WE GOTTA KEEP GRINDING HARDER nOY :d  &lt;3
 Cjx_1: sry
 UndercoverToad: CAPSLOCK IS ALWAYS GREAT
 AlMualem: you need to be heard!!!!!
 Cjx_1: when i loose in an fps its normally because shift key&#160;!= caps key lol
 UndercoverToad: reconfigure the key in your system settings
 Cjx_1: double shift? Provocative.... Powerful....
 iMobile: is it possible to retry a specific clash
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Noyotens: I WANT LEARN AI ANY TuTorial
 iMobile: ty
 Cjx_1: iMobile, you can recreate the seed using added parameters at least. Not sure if you could get a specific opponents bot, short of coding their moves to be recreated.Others would know better though.
 Cjx_1: Ooooh :8
 Cjx_1: thats awesome
 AlMualem: guys i want to say ,i am really happy for the developers community...there is so much sharing  :D 
 UndercoverToad: only during contests
 UndercoverToad: next week the chat will be less active again
 AlMualem: yes but there are forums and sites with questions and answers
 UndercoverToad: and tons of helpful writeups for previous contests
 michaelzlatkin1: Guys I'm so lost as to what you're supposed to do to prevent losing because a bot bumped you out of the way. Do you write avoidance? But wouldn't that just make you slower than if you just take the hit?
 MSmits: are you talking about coders strikes back michaelzlatkin1?
 MSmits: most players are currently doing a different game on this website
 michaelzlatkin1: Yeah, sorry didn't realize this was a global chat!
 MSmits: there is no other chat really, unless you're French or russian
 michaelzlatkin1: Alas, I'm not
 MSmits: it's ok to ask here
 struct: euler you dont predict enemy right?
 michaelzlatkin1: Thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: so anyways, if you get to the point where collisions matter, you need to start thinkign about a real simulation and search in your bot
 MSmits: simple heuristics won't be enough then
 MSmits: there's some sources on the csb main page
 MSmits: but if you're looking to learn how to write a search/sim, csb might not be the simplest game to do this for the first time
 elderlybeginner: to start brutaltester, do I need cg-brutaltester or I can go directly to the referee fork and clone the repo?
 MSmits: I generally recommend playing this game until you get to this point, then try a different game, like a board game, to practice search/sim
 MSmits: can always go back later
 michaelzlatkin1: I see, yeah it's a bit unfortunate as I'm pretty junior and a company asked me to do this challenge as a code test
 MSmits: I see, what is your current rank?
 michaelzlatkin1: AI is really not my strong suit so it's been a challenge haha
 michaelzlatkin1: Bronze 1
 StevenV: haha bot programming for coders test
 michaelzlatkin1: Or 3
 MSmits: ah, let's take this to pm
 michaelzlatkin1: Sounds good
 MSmits: I'll help
 michaelzlatkin1: Thank you so much!

 elderlybeginner: cg-brutal can be replaced with original-spring from referee clone or should I clone <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a> as well?
 DaNinja: you need brutaltester to test spring
 Pick8chu: Sigh
 ddreams: elderlybeginner for the second error message, you have too new java
 ddreams: install java8
 AlMualem: sum of top 3 players with &gt;=5 participants
 elderlybeginner: i'm getting errors, but it seems to workopenjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20
 elderlybeginner: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/ttfHkdE.png">https://imgur.com/ttfHkdE.png</a>seems to be legit thank you for your help
 Chainman: Hello
 jrke: damn today I was in wood 1 of OOC someone pushed me in bronze and same code is now 1st in bronze lol
 AlMualem: :D
 AlMualem: gl mate
 Marchete: no elderlybeginner
 Marchete: use Java8
 Marchete: in linux you can install as alternative
 solistice: looking to implement prio queue in c#.. but that's slow, no?
 Nerchio: its fine
 UndercoverToad: too bad there is none in the default C# library
 solistice: haven't found one&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: give me a moment, i have one that i copied from elsewhere
 BoBot: is there a (relatively) simple function for (cellindex1, cellindex2) =&gt; areOnTheSameDiagonal?
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e074ca3c-33a7-48aa-ae6a-1e865a138fe1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e074ca3c-33a7-48aa-ae6a-1e865a138fe1</a>
 solistice: thx!
 kovi: wow, nice euler
 BoBot: I am looking at the numbers and I don't see it (and yea, I know I am about a week late with this :D )
 UndercoverToad: thanks kovi. got a bit of code working finally
 Cjx_1: bobot, consider what parameters are baked into the board. Maybe the cell neighbors can help you
 kovi: you were beating me already last days, and now you also beat others&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: equal rights for all
 UndercoverToad: except terry, that one hurts
 elderlybeginner: Marchete I will.BTW, what's not computed here?WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.
 BoBot: @Cjx_1 thanks, I will try some more - I know how to do it with "normal" coordinates and neighbor "deltas", but there are large jumps here :D
 BoBot: oh, ffs, they are giving us the neighbors, nvm, I really should have started sooner...I am also trying out a new language
 alchemsti: So, I'm suddenly getting a bad_alloc error in C++, which suggests to me running out of memory -- but tonnes of memory i s available (768MB I believe) and I'm pretty sure I'm not using that
 alchemsti: (of course probably I am)
 alchemsti: But -- has anyone else seen this? Coudl they have reduced limits?
 alchemsti: I'm seeing it at early setup,where I really haven't allocated much of anything...
 Marchete: incompatible Java versions, so better avoid any ERROR by using Java8. I had exactly that problem and changed to openjdk 8 while maintaining JDK11
 Marchete: no errors so far
 elderlybeginner: what do you brutaltester you bot against? Your other bot?
 Marchete: me? crying with that many bugs
 alchemsti: Hmm, I wonder if I have something too big on the stack...?
 Marchete: for others is to change parameters and keep the better
 elderlybeginner: so it's brutaltesting against your bots with different parameters. No access to boss thou
 Marchete: yep
 elderlybeginner: and you finish winning with your previous bot with 100% rate and loosing with everybody else :joy:
 Marchete: inbreeding
 Marchete: and it happens a lot
 Marchete: it's like two children playing basketball
 Marchete: and one of them always win
 Marchete: and he try to play against NBA
 Marchete: tries*
 UndercoverToad: my 58% offline winrate translated pretty well
 ClockSort: wtfffffffffffffff my bot has been predicting shade wrong this entire time i think
 ClockSort: still looking into it...
 Marchete: I have so many bugs I'll need another week
 Marchete: wow euler
 Marchete: congrats
 UndercoverToad: thanks&#160;:)
 Marchete: new feature?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 Marchete: great
 Marchete: you still have new magic tricks after a week
 Marchete: if you are topN will you write a PM?
 Marchete: I always like these
 Marchete: N is decided by you :D
 StevenV: it is end of challenge now
 struct: wow top 5
 struct: grats
 UndercoverToad: we'll see. there isn't much interesting in my bot even. but i have off tomorrow
 StevenV: tomorrow will be ended
 kovi: poor illedan
 UndercoverToad: and I want to win Germany at least. that Philipp is strong
 StevenV: still don't know how to go to legend
 JohnCM: oh so exciting, i'm only 5-10 pts diff from the gold boss
 MSmits: only?
 StevenV:&#160;?
 JohnCM:&#160;?
 StevenV:&#160;:?
 MSmits: or do you mean ranks?
 JohnCM: nono i mean points as in game points
 MSmits: 5-10 is a lot
 MSmits: &lt; 2 is a little
 JohnCM: well this morning it was 60
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well good job then
 JohnCM: yep just plain old heuristics
 JohnCM: although i coded quite an elaborate one-ply search for growing
 Chainman: really?
 Chainman: I'm stuck in bottom of gold with heuristics.
 JohnCM: yea prioritize growth which leads to a good outcome
 StevenV: I keep getting this error
 JohnCM: like gain more sun overall for yourself and blocks off opponent
 StevenV: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 StevenV: :persevere:
 JohnCM: yea i get the same error
 JohnCM: i guess thre is a limit to the number of tries
 StevenV: So I think this is why a lot of devs recommend brutal test
 MSmits: yeah, it is much faster
 StevenV: But I don't really know how to use it
 Chainman: oh crap
 JohnCM: i think the hardest part for my bot is that it doesn't adapt very well to the opponent fast strat
 JohnCM: i take my time to grow trees, but if opp keeps harvesting, i lose a bunch of pts
 MSmits: someone should really share how to do this halfway through the contest. If you look at chat history, you will find some tidbits about how to use it here and there
 MSmits: forum post would be nicer though
 StevenV: thanks
 MSmits: can someone share the wiki chat history thingy
 StevenV: I mean tomorrow is over, So I will try to use it later
 JohnCM: MSmits, how're you doing for this challenge?
 Chainman: I also didn't have time to figure out brutaltester.
 JohnCM: have you broke into legend alr?
 Chainman: I need to focus just on coding.
 MSmits: JohnCM I am in legend yeah. I dont think i'll be going up much higher though. Hope for a place halfway through legend
 MSmits: trying one or two more things, then it's done
 JohnCM: all the best!
 MSmits: thanks
 JohnCM: haha i'm thinking of monte carlo now, since my bot doesn't adapt well. haha maybe i should have started off with that
 Chainman: good luck
 StevenV: I still in gold, but really can't figure out how to be legend
 MSmits: a lot of things work JohnCM, but whatever you do is going to have to be supported by heuristics and pruning and some evaluation
 Chainman: you are doing not that bad in gold JohnCM.  I'm behind you.
 JohnCM: definitely, i have plenty of heuristics and pruning
 Pick8chu: Man
 JohnCM: haha thanks Chainman, let's see if i can hit legend after a few heuristic tweaks
 StevenV: some of my friends use monte but they can't even win silver boss
 Pick8chu: these few days I was working on the challenge and learned so much through this chat lol
 Pick8chu: you guys are so smart
 JohnCM: silver boss not that tough compared to gold
 Chainman: my last submit seems to be worse lol, I'm still like 100 places lower in this submit.
 JohnCM: the main thing is to ensure your pieces are in "knights move" so they don't block each other. and harvest once you have &gt;4 trees
 JohnCM: should be able to get gold with that
 StevenV: I mean hard to use Monte for this challenge
 StevenV: I am already in gold
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/knights-move-2.html">https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/knights-move-2.html</a> lol
 Chainman: yeah keep them distance 2 to have knights move
 Chainman: except for that one diagonal
 MSmits: Monte works fine StevenV, you just need to do it in Python
 Chainman: actuall you just need to check if it is collinear with distance 2 for it to be knights move
 Chainman: I mean it should not be collinear
 StevenV: I will try after this challenge end
 MSmits: I was kidding :P
 StevenV: I don't think I have time to implement monte now
 MSmits: it'd be Monte Python is all
 JohnCM: haha
 JohnCM: i get the joke
 JohnCM: but really, monte implement in C++ or C# is better
 JohnCM: you get more iterations
 MSmits: yup
 JohnCM: python is for lazy coders like me who want to just get gold with heuristics
 MSmits: well c# wont do that much better than java really
 StevenV: I use java, which have problems with performance
 JohnCM: so it's C++ then
 MSmits: or Rust&#160;:)
 StevenV: It's 3 years since I last use C++ in school
 StevenV: :D
 StevenV: really don't remember much of it syntax
 Marchete: no MSmits
 Marchete: you are wrong
 Marchete: C# &gt;&gt;&gt; Java
 MSmits: i'm sure it's faster, but isnt it similar order of magnitude
 MSmits: I mean c++ was always 2-3 times faster than both of these
 Marchete: sometimes is
 Marchete: I recoded something to C#
 Marchete: got same performance
 Marchete: using AVX2 and such
 MSmits: you mean from c++ to C#?
 StevenV: C# same performance as C++ really?
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: well i suppose using the same intrinsics, where these operations are the bottleneck, it makes sense
 struct: omg top 30
 struct: I cant look
 JohnCM: the containers are very efficient
 struct: o.o

 Marchete: 12us/sample
 Chainman: legend struct?
 TobiasA: what does the circle beside the number on the leaderboard mean?
 Marchete: good job struct
 dbdr: progress status TobiasA
 TobiasA: of submit?
 dbdr: yes
 Marchete: euler is going strong
 MSmits: lol I accidentally set my beamsearch to exit when day &gt;= beamwidth and it performed ok anyways
 MSmits: i guess time runs out
 peerdb: how small is your beamwidth?
 dbdr: how did you manage that?
 MSmits: 1000 :P
 peerdb: &lt; 24 then
 MSmits: was gonna use BEAM_DEPTH, but typed BEAM_WIDTH
 peerdb: ah gotcha
 dbdr: if day &gt; 1000, you can exit, yes&#160;;)
 MSmits: this contest is just full of funny errors for me
 dbdr: long term planning
 MSmits: looooong term
 StevenV: I use Java and really don't know to do simulation without timeout errors
 MSmits: dont make new objects
 MSmits: generate a big store of them in the first 1 second
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: and then just reuse them
 Trottel-Nit: Two tricks: Create most objects in the first turn (no "new" durcing game turns, use your own pool-arrays). B) "Warmup" the JIT, run some game loops on the first turn
 struct: I didnt think my change would be this big
 StevenV: Thanks
 Trottel-Nit: that is a B ) ... no fun in there ...
 Marchete: what change?
 dbdr: nice struct! where were you before?
 struct: 66
 struct: not massive improvement but ill take it :D
 flyingferret: wowfirst time here...and ouch i'm rusty 
 StevenV: Do we have any gift if we rank high?
 struct: top 20 gets shirt
 struct: top 3 gets art
 StevenV: art?
 struct: a canvas
 StevenV: picture?
 KelvinAndHubbles: the timer in the top left jus randomly turn red for anyone?
 Cjx_1: bout to explode
 Cjx_1: run
 CouscousAgha: we are now in the end game
 Chainman: yep
 JohnCM: ok i can't test in ide anymore
 Chainman: It's getting exciting for the day. 
 JohnCM: time to go rest i guess haha
 JohnCM: see how it goes tomorrow with my new untested submit
 Chainman: yeah that was me yesterday, and then I slept for 10 hours 
 Chainman: and cleared up my issue in like 5 minutes when wake up. 
 JohnCM: i'm losing by 5 pts to this super mario dp guy
 JohnCM: aginer.. haha so frustrating
 Chainman: dynamic programming?
 JohnCM: display pic
 Chainman: oh
 ClockSort: super mario dp... haha
 ClockSort: dp[mario][luigi]
 TheBatMan_TM: hey guys
 Marchete: reCurs_e plays completely different
 TheBatMan_TM: how do i run sudo in repl.it?

 Marchete: SEED 24 11?
 Marchete: at frame 6
 ClockSort: i'm going to legend
 ClockSort: gg
 JohnCM: nice one clocksort
 Cjx_1: grats
 ClockSort: i had a bug where my MCTS thought small trees could shade large ones.
 ClockSort: i fixed it and now I've won 43 in a row, no losses, in gold division
 JohnCM: i actually removed the knights move requirement and my code is performing better
 JohnCM: wow MCTS really works wonders
 struct: yeah marchete
 struct: but it makes sense in the future
 ClockSort: mcts is magic
 JohnCM: how many moves did you lookahead till
 JohnCM: for mcts
 kovi: competition is heavy for 3rd place
 ClockSort: i get about 10k rollouts from a new position on day 7
 JohnCM: or just random rollouts till game end (which is a little too much)
 ClockSort: but then day 8 i often predicted my opponent's move so i can build off that tree
 ClockSort: yes it's rollouts to the end position
 Chainman: you removed knight moves, crap
 Chainman: I need to learn mcts after this contest
 Chainman: not enough time in 16 hours.
 JohnCM: haha i don't think i can do that kind of rollout in python
 Marchete: simplify to rollout 6
 JohnCM: but i did a 2-day lookahead for tree growing to see if i should grow in a particular spot
 Marchete: waits
 Chainman: crap I was going to try the knight moves thing. 
 Chainman: It's worse though?
 Pick8chu: gosh dang ittttttttttt
 Pick8chu: oh. post4k sorry i'm not sure
 KelvinAndHubbles: post4k, no quite way, you just have to guess
 post4k: hehe
 post4k: Ill just guess then&#160;:)
 KelvinAndHubbles: just do every clash chat and hope people dont think your crazy
 Pick8chu: I changed to cpp from JS and totally forgot divisionbetween int give you int
 Pick8chu: .....
 ClockSort: 65 matches complete in gold so far, 100% wins.  o_O
 Chainman: wow
 Chainman: that's awesome
 Pick8chu: that really is, good for you
 Wontonimo: i'm taking credit for popularizing "knights move" thing here.  Do it Chainman!
 ClockSort: oh, you mean Chainman's Opening?
 Wontonimo: Hey Chainman - this video on MCTS is great.  He even gives exact calculations so you can make unit tests of it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a>
 Chainman: lol
 Chainman: I'm doing knight move
 Chainman: but I noticed bossoot from silver was doing  knight's move as well.  
 Chainman: I just didn't do it, but try in gold. 
 Chainman: crap, maybe I'll try to learn mcts, I'm like 965 in gold now&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: JohnCM - my MCTS bot easily gets to depth 27 with only 3K rollouts
 Marchete: 3k rollouts to end?
 dbdr: that might be too deep and not wide enough, not enough exploration
 rohrokz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1755144530fa86c4f2f3b265568cb9f926d4e10">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1755144530fa86c4f2f3b265568cb9f926d4e10</a>
 Scarfield: But less depth means one has to make an effort of making an eval function :p
 Wontonimo: dbdr thanks, you are probably correct
 dbdr: I suppose the depth only count the tree part. you can still use rollouts to avoid an eval
 CouscousAgha: you got this ClockSort
 ClockSort: i know lol, it's not close
 ClockSort: did you hear about my bug?
 Wontonimo: Marchete - yes, 3k rollouts to end on around day 4.  Day 1 only 2k.
 Wontonimo: i've got some performance issues.  it should be around 10-15k
 Marchete: linear MCTS?
 Marchete: like p1 first sim then p2 sim
 Chainman: 3 ms for a turn with just heuristics lol&#160;:(
 Chainman: so far I look better than my original bot with just addition of knight's move
 Wontonimo: 1 player mcts.  i may work on DUCT in a few hours
 Chainman: I've won 4/4 with knight's move against myself
 Chainman: I think it's an improvement
 Chainman: okay 6/7 I guess
 Wontonimo: it is.  my theory is that it encourages growth into your opponents area and is a proxy for avoiding your own shadows of that one tree
 AntiSquid: damn, should have done this strategy from day one&#160;:/
 Chainman: I'm debating to try mcts or just add some search algos. 
 AntiSquid: fastest rank improvement
 Chainman: what AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: random heuristics
 Chainman: what's that?
 Wontonimo: return actions[ rand()%len(actions) ]
 AntiSquid: something that can get you legend Chainman
 SirLoxley: Darn&#160;:/ I wanted to debug my simulator ... tried to use the offline coding game tool, didn't work and deleted it ... and ended up deleting my simulator, too. Guess that's game over for me. Good luck to all who still compete
 Pick8chu: When you guys run on brutaltester, do you fight with your own bot?
 Chainman: without search algos?
 ddreams: Pick8chu yes
 UndercoverToad: yes Pick8chu
 UndercoverToad: :D
 Wontonimo: oh man , that 's doo bad. SirLoxley&#160;!
 Pick8chu: I seeee
 Pick8chu: ddreams yo!
 Pick8chu: morning man
 ddreams: or, an older version of the bot
 Chainman: git SirLoxley
 ddreams: morning, having fun?&#160;:)
 Pick8chu: I made it work with c++ haha
 struct: ok now im a bit more motivated to keep going
 Wontonimo: several older versions - so as to not overfit just the last one
 struct: lets see if I can get top 20
 struct: But cant get a shirt&#160;:'(
 Wontonimo: go struct go!
 AntiSquid: because of what i said struct right&#160;?
 Pick8chu: and was working on it but jsut found out that I've been dividing int/int which only gave me 1 or 0
 Chainman: lol random heuristics doesn't even make sense
 SirLoxley: I am more of a mercurial guy ... anyway that would not have helped me.
 AntiSquid: ok what is your best gold rank Chainman&#160;?
 Chainman: umm I was 965, but just submitted with knight's move.
 Chainman: hopefully break 800 now or something idk
 Wontonimo: i think he meant "a heuristic, not anyone one in particular that has been discussed here" Chainman
 Scarfield: what is knights move? seeding in "triangles"?
 SirLoxley: I still have the compiled binary and an earlier core file. Not sure there's a lot I can do
 AntiSquid: so look at my rank and of couirse it doesn't make sense but i am correct Chainman
 Chainman: Sure, but I think I need to know what you mean by random heuristics. 
 Wontonimo: from chess Scarfield, step 2 in line, then one to the side.
 Chainman: Cause just using some random heuristic obviously wouldn't work, or choosing random actions.
 Wontonimo: basically, not in a straight line from the seeding tree
 Chainman: or I'd be doing better right now lol
 AntiSquid: from 900 to 440 now :D
 Scarfield: yea got it wonto ty&#160;:)
 Chainman: Scarfield <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/knights-move-2.html">https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/knights-move-2.html</a>
 AntiSquid: 414
 AllYourTrees: nice AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: 397 lol
 Chainman: wow
 ddreams: if you're doing really badly, the best strategy is to do the opposite of what you think is good aka. the reverse self-psychology strategy
 Marchete: the opposite of bad is worse
 AntiSquid: anyways i do agree it doesn't make sense because obviously the game is balanced and favors skill, right right?
 Wontonimo: hey AntiSquid, what was your rank before knight move&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i don't have knight move
 Chainman: you mean me probably
 Chainman: I am not doing much better on submit with knight's move, but it was beating my version 6/7 when I tested it.
 Marchete: knight move is automatically executed if you eval some kind of shadow alignment
 Chainman: I'm still 900 rank 
 Scarfield: queen move is better obviously, because queen better than knight :p
 Chainman: but I'm only 20%
 ClockSort: go for pawn move, you might promote
 AntiSquid: if (!bfs_mask[seed_idx]) gp-&gt;score+=10;
 Chainman: all reverse psychology, just play chess 
 Scarfield: lol clock
 Wontonimo: bfs_mask&#160;?
 Wontonimo: brute force search mask&#160;?
 AntiSquid: don't think about it, just do it
 ddreams: Best FriendS mask
 Scarfield: breath first Seed
 Wontonimo: oh, i'm stupid
 Wontonimo: thanks
 AntiSquid: damn i have some timeouts for games i should have won&#160;:'( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556845158">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556845158</a>
 ddreams: AntiSquid I'm getting an error about bfs_mask not defined.. help?
 Chainman: lolololololol
 Chainman: I have same problem
 ClockSort: that's happening to me too
 Wontonimo: how long are submits taking now?
 struct: they are fast
 Chainman: for me I'm 27% in like 5 minutes +
 AntiSquid: 9/10 wow that's an amazing start @_@
 ddreams: 13% in 10 minutes
 struct: mine took around 1 hour?
 AntiSquid: hope it keeps up! 
 Chainman: NameError: name 'bfs_mask' is not defined
 CharmyRosewolf: So close to beating gold bot. I don't know if I can take this pain any longer :sob:
 Chainman: I tried the random heuristics AntiSquid but I lose 39 - 151 to my bot lol
 UndercoverToad: that's significant
 Chainman: I do wonder if it is best to take like 5 best moves and just choose randomly
 UndercoverToad: why not take the best?
 dbdr: might be too good
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: will see what this does (hoarding ftw) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556865650">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556865650</a>
 ddreams: surprise the opponent
 Chainman: lol, nerf the bot, he is too strong
 UndercoverToad: right, we don't need a 2nd recurs e. random of top5 is allowed
 ddreams: maybe that's his strat
 UndercoverToad: not nerfing it? that's not fair
 ClockSort: ok i made it into legend
 Scarfield: nice!
 ClockSort: and i'm still rocking it :scream:
 ClockSort: #34 and climbing
 UndercoverToad: don't worry, reality will hit you when you fight #1
 UndercoverToad: but well done for going that high after promotion
 Chainman: whoah congrats ClockSort
 ClockSort: i'm weak against bots who stockpile suns
 ddreams: nice, cs
 ClockSort: @UndercoverToad i had a bug where i let small trees shade big ones. I was top of gold with that bug (!)
 ClockSort: fixing that bug launched me, um, very high.
 UndercoverToad: that's a horrible bug :D
 ClockSort: i know, it's crazy that i won any matches
 Chainman: wonderful bug for others though.
 struct: its still mcts ClockSort?
 ClockSort: @struct yep, duct mcts
 kovi: gratz clock, duct has a chance for top20

 Chainman: section
 UndercoverToad: february the 4th?
 UndercoverToad: aah, sorry
 Smelty: nah, april the second
 Smelty: oop
 UndercoverToad: somehow I filter links while reading
 Scarfield: 1/100 of a good time
 ClockSort: i invented duct and then discovered it had a name and then found that paper :P
 UndercoverToad: smits needed 2 years to find a paper about it
 Scarfield: duct is smitsi?
 UndercoverToad: it's not? i didn't read all the details
 Scarfield: no idea, havent looked into it
 RoboStac: no - smitsi has separate trees per player, duct is one tree 
 Scarfield: saw da_po call it UCT forest
 dbdr: I think there's a paper for what MSmits does too, isn't there
 Smelty: wait w0t
 MSmits: I'm not sure
 RoboStac: yeah, theres a few very similar things. Can't remember the names though
 Smelty: yes
 UndercoverToad: oh, we summoned him
 MSmits: :P
 Smelty: h-him?
 UndercoverToad: smits is a he
 MSmits: did not get around to trying smitsimax in this contest btew
 Smelty: he?
 Smelty: hmmyes
 UndercoverToad: you told me to try it but I never intended to give it a try&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: should I feel guilty now?
 MSmits: nope
 Scarfield: yes!
 MSmits: I am not sure if it is worth trying
 MSmits: this game has me unsure about everything
 CogitoErgoProxy: hi guys i've not undestood how do i recognize a undiagnosed sample from a diagnosed in code4life, do you have hint?
 MSmits: err... that's pretty random
 MSmits: I understand csb questions, but...
 UndercoverToad: score -1 i think
 struct: I think its time for an all nighter :D
 MSmits: not me, i am quitting in an hour or two i think
 MSmits: maybe i'll do some netflix 'n brutaltest (no chill)
 struct: maybe ill do some aws and wait
 UndercoverToad: maybe my computer has to sleep in the bath tonight
 Chainman: hahahaha
 Chainman: alright I'm rank in top 800 now in gold.  I'm ready for searching.
 MSmits: mmh I just wrote opponent prediction beamsearch, integrated into my own beamsearch and I get the same wr.... thats just annoying
 MSmits: i mean, if it was much worse... ok, but 50%, wth
 UndercoverToad: congrats, for me it got worse
 Chainman: how do deal with score when searching moves ahead? 
 UndercoverToad: yes
 Chainman: I'm not sure, do I just add score for a path, and take path with greatest score
 Chainman: instead of just choosing next move with greatest score.
 Cruiser18: Is there a way to try some of the Clash Of Code challenges, without actually being pitted against other people?
 MSmits: depends on your search Chainman
 MSmits: i dont know what you are doing
 MSmits: is this a beamsearch?
 Chainman: I'm going to be doing a beginner simple search algorithm, maybe prune it to be like beam_search
 MSmits: then i dont know what to tell you except yeah you somehow take the best path/highest score
 MSmits: searches are all different
 Chainman: I think I'm going to be doing beam search lol
 MSmits: with that one you take the highest scoring state at the last finished depth level and pick the first move of its path
 Chainman: I mean I tried earlier, but gave up on it, and now I have better heuristics. 
 MSmits: so make sure you can reconstruct the path or at least keep a reference to the move done
 Chainman: I had made it too complicated and it was super slow. 
 Chainman: I see thanks MSmits
 MSmits: np
 AntiSquid: #366 Chainman
 Chainman: nice, still not sure what you did lol
 azriel1rf: Now, I'm in Legend!
 azriel1rf: in Spring Challenge
 AntiSquid: are you looking for a job or you wrote that for fun in your profile azriel1rf&#160;?
 azriel1rf: i have no job,,
 azriel1rf: is it prohibited to write such thing?
 ddreams: no
 azriel1rf: ok
 AntiSquid: no was about to ask if that's why you were committed to get legend :P
 azriel1rf: lol
 MSmits: could change it to: *WILL WORK FOR $$$"
 azriel1rf: you said it
 azriel1rf: i use much time to 
 azriel1rf: this challenge
 aangairbender: wow top1 is so far ahead
 MSmits: yep, mostly unbeatable
 aangairbender: neural network?
 AntiSquid: go NN or go home
 MSmits: it is my guess yes
 Westicles: opening book+SA+closing book
 BrunoFelthes: i won 1 against reCurse, then i realize that he timeout
 AntiSquid: no, we are past that question . which algo is it is the question
 azriel1rf: learn locally and implement it into code?
 MSmits: share with us how to make him timeout :P
 LoganWlv: Haha
 Kellthazar: Jeez...
 Michael_Howard: I'm losing with "-" score in Arena games I win when send game parameters to IDE - is that definitely timeouts?
 AntiSquid: Scarfield hi how's it going, what did you do for your bot? :P
 ddreams: or crashes
 ddreams: or memory limit exceeded
 AntiSquid: MSmits beam or mcts  ?
 Michael_Howard: I don't have a tree&#160;:)
 ClockSort: @Michael_Howard I am getting the same results
 MSmits: beam AntiSquid
 Scarfield: hi squiddy, "guided" MC both players UCT for first action
 ClockSort: sometimes '-' in battles
 Westicles: Is dapo a NN guy?
 MSmits: might have tried a different one if i did not spend so much time fixing dumb bugs
 Scarfield: rest actions random
 Scarfield: sim till end of game
 MSmits: Westicles doubt it, he won that sponsored contest without NN
 AntiSquid: Westicles why are you asking about him&#160;?
 BrunoFelthes: i'm using GA
 Westicles: Just wondering if anyone can swoop in and win
 MSmits: the only way to do that is to somehow find out what makes re curses bot fail and keep it hidden until the last moment
 MSmits: not the way i would want to win though
 AntiSquid: probably if the contest prizes were as big as for the private one Westicles
 ddreams: lol, did a change that looked good to me just testing losing games without testing it in brutal
 ddreams: much better arena rank
 ddreams: 36% wins in brutaltester
 MSmits: arena is pretty random though
 ClockSort: is grow 33 a mistake on round 4 in this game against Mazelcop? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556895891">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556895891</a>
 BrunoFelthes: what is the prizes for private contests AntiSquid?
 MSmits: check how much your rank increase corresponds with in terms of rating ddreams
 MSmits: if it's less than a point, it could just be random
 BlitzProg: MCTS being built... looks hard to stabilize
 BlitzProg: so far, 0.4ms per rollout but crashes eventually
 solistice: someone please kill me
 UndercoverToad: it's certainly not optimal ClockSort. but i'm not sure if my bot would even do the same bad action
 solistice: been working for hours fixing something and not figuring out why I coulnd't reach gold
 UndercoverToad: do you have the input for that turn? i'd want to know what I would do
 kovi: talking about surprise - RoboStac is also capable of doing mcts-nn
 solistice: saw that I stopped after 1 iteration of Iterative Deepening for testing purposes
 UndercoverToad: 1 or 2 days ago he said he's stuck
 solistice: so was consantly looking depth 2
 ddreams: MSmits is there a way to check what rank I had?
 MSmits: no, but i would guess you knew, because you said it was doing better?
 ddreams: well, I never broke top 100 before
 UndercoverToad: and he's not the guy for last minute surprises. was leading code royale from start to finish
 kovi: true
 MSmits: robo does not hide I think
 JBM: who does though
 BlitzProg: nvm, wasn't reseting action count when rolling, surprised it wasn't crashing earlier lol
 BlitzProg: it's... somehow better than my MC so far? that's insane
 kovi: i didnt meant hiding, just getting nn ready over a pure/nonheuristic mcts/duct
 ClockSort: @UndercoverToad i don't know how to get the input
 ClockSort: the reason i play grow33 here is because i'm favoring large trees in a heuristic. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556895891">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556895891</a>
 UndercoverToad: i always print stdin directly to stderr
 ddreams: Illedan still improving your bot, or do I have a shot at #1 in the country?&#160;:)
 ClockSort: i think i can just remove that heuristic and rely on mcts
 UndercoverToad: then i can copy-paste from the replay info
 UndercoverToad: Illedan promised no sleep until he beats me
 struct: lol
 Chainman: let's go I'm 670 in gold
 ClockSort: i am going to try removing all opening heuristics and see if my less-buggy-mcts can outthink them
 ddreams: clearly inspired by Harald Hårfagre.. the king who refused to cut his hair until Norway was one kingdom
 AntiSquid: is this stuck at 300&#160;? annoying @_@
 Scarfield: i caught up to you againg though, whats your approach squid?
 AntiSquid: Chokudai no kensaku arugorizumu
 UndercoverToad: new keyboard layout?
 ClockSort: ok, i removed my opening,  now mcts handles that too.
 azriel1rf: chokudai search? (beam search with efficiency to time management)
 Scarfield: according to google translate, Chokudai no kensaku arugorizumu = A little sickness
 struct: Im using chokudai
 struct: I think
 azriel1rf: chokudai no kensaku arugorizumu = chokudai's search algorithm
 struct: thats the translation?
 azriel1rf: yes
 AntiSquid: oh it's supposwed to be time efficient? when the width expands too much my bot times out
 Scarfield: not according to google translate :p
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e4493ade-9281-421a-9a4b-429c02f8c180">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e4493ade-9281-421a-9a4b-429c02f8c180</a>
 azriel1rf: no = の = 'skensaku = 検索 = search
 ddreams: you may be Japanese, but Scarfield trusts google
 AntiSquid: Scarfield look at his location, who do you trust? google or the native speaker?
 Scarfield: i believe you, just found it funny it was translated into "a little sickness"
 ddreams: well.. when I ask google voice translate to translate "it's martina's birthday and she's very happy" it thinks I'm saying "it's my pen*s birthday and she's very happy"
 AntiSquid: you use a vector for it struct or what&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Scarfield: thats because it always listens, and translates what you are most likely saying :p
 AntiSquid: tried anything else&#160;? linked list or somesuch&#160;?
 ddreams: I was trying to demonstrate that her mother and I could use google translate to communicate (she's italian)
 ddreams: lol
 Scarfield: xD
 struct: vector is fast enough
 struct: I barely use it
 struct: I use it like 10 times per turn at most
 AntiSquid: maybe i implemented something wrong
 struct: maybe I also did :p
 Chainman: so basically I kind of have to simulate gamestate in my beam_search, only thing that makes sense. 
 Zeph.: .
 Chainman: I want to beat gold boss at least once.
 Scarfield: thats the point of "searching" Chainman. you look some moves/actions ahead, evaluate the state, pick the move which leads to the most promising state
 Chainman: yeah just checking it's my first time.  
 cegprakash: Chainman just mimic gold boss
 Chainman: wasn't sure I was doing too much/unecessary work
 Scarfield: important node, if you havent thought about it, assume your opponent is trying to get the best score as well
 Scarfield: node = note
 Chainman: I like to assume my opponent is bad though :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Chainman: Wow recurse is far in lead.
 UndercoverToad: he's no fun playing against
 DomiKo: top20 is hard now&#160;:/
 UndercoverToad: fix it
 DomiKo: i'm trying :sob:
 UndercoverToad: 408 in submit
 DomiKo: I can't add any feature to eval that don't break my bot :9
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: been there, dumped eval and started at 0
 DomiKo: ehhhh
 struct: I think the only way I can climb now is if I had any enemy prediction
 struct: I still have 0
 ddreams: 408 in submit? is it broken again?
 UndercoverToad: top 20 is possible without prediction
 struct:&#160;:'(
 jrke: i won't be in legend another contest again :disappointed:
 ddreams: I'm at 73% after two hours&#160;:&lt;
 UndercoverToad: 56%, 1h 17
 jrke: gn
 ddreams: perhaps ping thib already?
 UndercoverToad: not sure if system problem or sunday business
 ClockSort: not sure if sunday problem or system business
 UndercoverToad: i have an echo
 Alexiada: y
 Alexiada: h
 ddreams: echo off
 Alexiada: salut
 dbf: good that I don't need to submit now&#160;:) can see that it is not better from 10 games&#160;:(
 ddreams: just passed Illedan.. I hope he's sleeping already
 UndercoverToad: it's 7:43pm for him
 Krakenus00: Wow, you were prepared
 ddreams: and me
 UndercoverToad: and he's online on discord
 ddreams: here too
 UndercoverToad: i didn't realize you are from Norway too :D
 struct: ping him&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: thibaud?
 ddreams: nooo, let him sleep
 struct: Illedan
 dbf: or cut his internet cable
 struct: ok 14 hours left
 UndercoverToad: time to start coding
 struct: yes
 ddreams: time to completely reimplement everything
 struct: its time for clash 
 struct: I will rush now
 struct: my brain is fresh
 ddreams: try the escape room?
 struct: already did them
 UndercoverToad: i did half for a room
 Zenoscave: time to fix my eval issues
 UndercoverToad: half of*
 struct: You didnt like it euler?
 UndercoverToad: meh
 struct: yeah its not for everyone
 struct: I enjoyed it tbf
 ddreams: I love real escape rooms
 UndercoverToad: i want clear tasks, no riddles where I have to find out what to do
 ddreams: zeno, you're throwing away points in the last day
 AntiSquid: you didn't see the worst part of it UndercoverToad
 Zenoscave:  does anyone know who in top 20 uses Beam Search?
 struct: im top 30
 struct: 31&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: with beam?
 UndercoverToad: i know that I use beam
 kovi: me2
 struct: chokudai
 casmith789: waiting for all the games played is nailbiting stuff
 Zenoscave: how many sims (turn sims not day sims) do you guys finish?
 struct: 1.5mill +-
 Zenoscave: welp...
 Zenoscave: 50K isn't gonna help then
 peerdb: 1.5m is insane
 ddreams: depends on your eval zeno
 ddreams: 50k is sufficient
 ClockSort: 1.5m sims??!
 Eglerion: I should go switch language. Only at about 2k in PHP&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: It's absolute trash
 UndercoverToad: 40k for me&#160;:(
 ddreams: 200k for me
 ClockSort: in fall 2020 i was getting 150k and it was pretty lean. hard to imagine 1.5 million. are you storing them in an array?
 DomiKo: a lot of seeds I guess
 UndercoverToad: them = nodes?
 ClockSort: yes, the object that contains, for example, the height map
 struct: What do you mean array?
 Zenoscave: I only allow one seed at a time. Is that not a valid pruning?
 struct: I store the states on an array yes for bs
 UndercoverToad: big fat static array
 Marchete: struct 1.5mill?
 Marchete: that's a lot
 struct: yes
 struct: GameState* Agent::states[3] = {new GameState[1000000], new GameState[1000000], new GameState[1000000]};
 struct: GameState* currentStates = &amp;states[0][0];GameState* nextStates = &amp;states[1][0];GameState* finishedStates = &amp;states[2][0];
 ClockSort: yeah, I use this:
 ClockSort: well i use a vector and alloc on Init, so it goes on the heap
 Zenoscave: fix it ClockSort
 ClockSort: @Zenoscave what do you mean, what's to fix?
 UndercoverToad: first turn will be WAIT, using more time for that sounds useless
 struct: my state is 96 bytes
 AntiSquid: why not prune some of them lol
 ClockSort: pruning takes time
 ddreams: UndercoverToad even so, it's nice to have the number
 Zenoscave: ClockSort stack tends to be faster here, iirc
 peerdb: damn, 96, my state is double that
 AntiSquid: anyone successfully transfering the search tree from turn to turn?#
 struct: What do you mean by transfering?
 UndercoverToad: 136 bytes per state for me
 ddreams: rerooting
 AntiSquid: first turn i get 330k but that's useless :D
 ClockSort: my state is huge, i don't even know how big. it has an array of 37 ints for each height. not the best, ha
 ddreams: I get 2.5m first turn
 AntiSquid: so what do you do with it afterwards?
 ddreams: throw it away of course
 struct: array of 37 ints?
 Zenoscave: 288 bytes here
 struct: oh god
 ClockSort: yeah
 ddreams: that's how I started too
 ClockSort: how do you store heights and check shadows?
 ddreams: now I have four uint64_t's
 struct: bitboard
 ddreams: bitboarding
 ClockSort: any reference/link for details?
 Zenoscave: struct do you not store forward days of shadows?
 AntiSquid: bitset
 struct: nope
 Zenoscave: trees[player][size] |= 1ul &lt;&lt; cellIndex
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf</a>
 ddreams: do you cache sun/shadow computations?
 ddreams:&#160;?
 struct: nope
 ddreams: oops, double q
 struct: my shadowing takes 10 nanoseconds
 struct: so idc
 UndercoverToad: what's that zeno?
 ddreams: the bitboarding pdf by cameron browne
 ClockSort: thank you struct for the link
 struct: n+
 struct: np*+
 jacek: np-complete+
 Zenoscave: for clocksort that's a basic bitboard encoding
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf">https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf</a> ClockSort
 struct: I could share my bitboard structure
 struct: is not amazing but I guess I could
 struct: after it ends
 struct: I think more people use it anyways
 Scarfield: dammit you won struct, even a cleaner link
 ClockSort: mcts was so hard to code (my first time) that i haven't spent much focus on making the state lean
 ddreams: well, you did beautifully apparently
 UndercoverToad: MCTS gets significantly better with more sims
 Scarfield: after contest i can recommend clobber for playing with bitboards, probably the simplest game to do that for, or maybe breakthrough
 ClockSort: very true @UndercoverToad
 struct: I still have time for mcts
 struct: but I have no idea how to implement duct
 ddreams: how many rollouts did you say you get, clocksort?
 ClockSort: roughly 10k from day 4, luckily i often predict the opponent's move and can reuse the tree on the following turn
 struct: 10k rollouts is how many sims?
 ddreams: 250k?
 ClockSort: my rollout is not a full sim. i cheat a lot, for example, don't check seed distances when seeding during rollout
 ClockSort: i just let them seed anywhere, it seems to work :grin:
 Scarfield: :scream:
 UndercoverToad: surprising
 struct: o.o
 ddreams: I've heard about such shortcuts, but didn't think it'd work here
 ClockSort: after midgame the whole board is reachable anyway
 kurnevsky: I had ~1500 sims in my mcts&#160;:)
 struct: ok im gonna implement it
 ClockSort: @kurnevsky me too, the O3 optimization helped
 ddreams: duct too, kurnevsky?
 struct: I have it coded already anyways
 kurnevsky: But probably I did something wrong - seems too small&#160;:)
 ddreams: I coded it up for fall.. perhaps I should try too
 kurnevsky: No, I don't use mcts because of this&#160;:)
 ddreams: aha.. beam search?
 kurnevsky: Plain minimax&#160;:)
 ddreams: nice, didn't think it'd work here
 UndercoverToad: even a non-parallel algo where the opponent can move after you?
 kurnevsky: Yes.
 UndercoverToad: and that huge branching
 AntiSquid: read chat history (wiki page) i said anything would work :P
 casmith789: finally legend&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: i discarded the idea on the first evening already
 AntiSquid: gz casmith789
 casmith789: ty
 UndercoverToad: dbdr still owes us some days of chat history
 kurnevsky: I had parallel version but then realized that it actually executed on single core&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: and he should lock out the spammers that make the server lag
 ddreams: wiki page?
 dbdr: easy to say :P
 UndercoverToad: with non-parallel I mean sequential (you take a step, then the opponent)
 UndercoverToad: dbdr isn't there a setting that you have to approve profiles before they can edit?
 Kellthazar: Im watching the alphago documentary to, maybe, have some idea to improve my heuristc XD
 kovi: recurse submit
 dbdr: yes, that's a good idea
 emagnidoc: hello, i m not sure if this is the right place to ask questions but i m having a weird issue where my test cases are green but the test case during submit is not. thx in advance
 UndercoverToad: while the game itself is concurrent, not sequential. which made me think that minimax would be too paranoid
 ddreams: takes hours for submissions now
 UndercoverToad: ping staff again or sit it out?
 dbdr: it's a broken reCurse submit I think
 struct: do it euler
 ddreams: I think pinging staff is worth it
 ddreams: costs me nothing
 UndercoverToad: your turn this time struct
 UndercoverToad: i already did on saturday, you can fully ruin the weekend
 struct: lol
 kurnevsky: &gt; with non-parallel I mean sequential (you take a step, then the opponent)
 struct: ill just wait for some random to ping them
 UndercoverToad: only mods can ping @staff
 dbf: maybe they have on-call rota and there is a next person already&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: submit count is stable around 400
 UndercoverToad: i still remember my 1st contest here (HyperSonic)submits on the last day were extremely slow. like 10h
 UndercoverToad: servers were crying in pain
 Chainman: RIP
 Zenoscave: ok 150k sims in 100ms now
 UndercoverToad: still 40k&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: but heavy eval
 Zenoscave: well that's my local number. I'm sure submit will be slower
 Zenoscave: 60% timeouts&#160;:/
 kurnevsky: Is it number of full game evaluations till the end?&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: 40k is my number of single actions I can simulate
 kovi: 80k heavy eval
 Scarfield: i wonder how expensive it is to increment the simcount
 natofp: Why does it make sense to run random algorithm in MCTS instead of using heuristic to evaluate the position?
 joelthelion: natofp your heuristic will bias your rollouts and that will make your MCTS miss possible counterplay
 UndercoverToad: it's just hard to come up with a good eval. but adding some domain knowledge can still help if done right
 joelthelion: I think slightly biasing your rollouts can work, but it's tricky business
 ddreams: the number of seed actions vastly outnumber the rest, so
 ddreams: I guess you can cheat
 natofp: but how does it make sense in chess for example? most of the games would end in a draw so you should probably eval after some random rounds?
 joelthelion: well, MCTS doesn't work too well for chess
 kurnevsky: Biased eval should work, at least pachi uses it.
 DomiKo: rebless recalc?
 DomiKo: now 100% winrate is coming?
 reCurse: Trying
 Scarfield: looks much better than the prev resubmit :muscle:
 UndercoverToad: i got a lucky win vs your last in arena but didn't save it
 Scarfield: 100% or delete account?
 kovi: i saw it...was thinking to finetune vs. recurse weakness for finals
 VizGhar: so its NN right?
 reCurse: :zipper_mouth:
 kovi: but now im too weak for top3 anyway
 Zenoscave: A Magician never reveals his secrets
 Zenoscave: their*
 UndercoverToad: tuning vs recurse gives you a good boost for each win
 ddreams: you had some timeouts?
 Zenoscave: if you can tune that is.
 UndercoverToad: outweights at least 2 losses vs equally ranked bots
 reCurse: I can't do anything about the timeouts
 reCurse: Server hiccups are impossible to plan against
 ddreams: just use 5% of your cpu to check the clock like me :p
 reCurse: Just trying to fix its moments of stupidity
 jacek: sidechannel attacks for you eval?
 UndercoverToad: you mean the moments where it completely stops playing and loses by 50 points?
 reCurse: Among other things
 UndercoverToad: does it try to get a high score even? or just win/loss?
 reCurse: :zipper_mouth:
 UndercoverToad: ok
 Astrobytes: nn confirmed :P
 UndercoverToad: will you tell tomorrow?
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: ok, hope to finally  beat silver, omg
 reCurse: Sure, trying to stay focused
 reCurse: Gonna close chat soon
 UndercoverToad: ?disableChat
 Zenoscave: ttyl reCurse GL on the 100%
 struct: is your goal 100% winrate?
 Astrobytes: It'll be a good PM, well done reCurse
 reCurse: Minus hiccups yes
 Scarfield: yea jebus, you are just being mean at this point :p
 reCurse: Sorry
 ddreams: sorry not sorry I believe
 jacek: hes canadian, the sorry is legit
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 reCurse: That man canadians
 peerdb: whats PM?
 Scarfield: post mortem
 peerdb: aah gotchu thanks
 Scarfield: or private message in some cases, but not this time&#160;:)
 ddreams: 100% completed battles now, up to rank 70, even if brutaltester gave 36% wins :o
 Zenoscave: which I always thought was a weird nomeclature
 Scarfield: ^
 peerdb: yeah RIP recurse I guess
 Astrobytes: Wonder if the Canadians got the 'sorry' thing from us Scots, we vastly overuse it
 ddreams: number of concurrent submits have started to drop, ,nice
 Zenoscave: dbdr <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556973528">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556973528</a>
 ddreams: maybe staff pinging helped
 Astrobytes: don't think anyone pinged staff
 Zenoscave: I lose 60% of the bottom league. you got a bug
 Scarfield: stru ct did i think(?)
 struct: nope
 Zenoscave: oh Hai mark
 ddreams: the toad did, I though
 ddreams: t
 dbdr: yes Zenoscave?&#160;:)
 ddreams: maybe not
 Astrobytes: Nothing on discord, unless it was in DMs
 Zenoscave: you've got a bug. I shouldn't beable to even tie your bot 
 Zenoscave: Bad search perhaps?
 dbdr: that's broad :D
 Scarfield: fix it
 UndercoverToad: i did not ping staff
 ddreams: zeno's bot is optimized to beat dbdr
 UndercoverToad: told struct that it's his turn today
 Zenoscave: I don't know how to be less broad. just suprised at a  win with a test bot that rarely wins
 ddreams: ah, right, looks improved anyway
 UndercoverToad: and submit count even below 400 again
 ddreams: yeah, my last battles suddenly finished too
 UndercoverToad: might be just a busy day. it always gets a little slower at the end
 UndercoverToad: and start of the contest as well
 Scarfield: temperature of server room :thinking:
 Zenoscave: is a true skill elo of 9.3 bad&#160;?
 Scarfield: that depends
 ddreams: val got a win against recurse... time to delete
 reCurse: Happier about that loss than some others I saw before
 UndercoverToad: 2 points difference and you were on the bottom side
 ddreams: some maps are very biased too
 UndercoverToad: which I consider at disadvantage
 ryoukai: What time does CP update daily?
 UndercoverToad: 3am CEST or something like that
 UndercoverToad: which would be in 6-7h
 Illedan: Hmm, ddreams above me. Ok, can't have this
 ryoukai: Thanks 
 peerdb: Question: Im trying to write a beamsort and to prune my nodes I have to sort them on value somehow. std::sort seems very slow, what are good ways to prune gamestates
 ddreams: bring it&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: you can't have me about you either Illedan. do something about it&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: I hate having a toad about me
 Illedan: I have 4 hours before bed. Wasn't allowed to be tierd tomorrow :D
 Astrobytes: zeno :rofl:
 UndercoverToad: a toad about you?
 UndercoverToad: is that a pun that I don't get?
 Astrobytes: UndercoverToad 07:39PMyou can't have me about you either 
 UndercoverToad:&#160;:(
 Scarfield: xD
 Zenoscave: :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 ddreams: toad doesn't even know what he's saying at this point
 Scarfield: MansplainstroBytes
 UndercoverToad: my fingers just don't obey me anymore
 Zenoscave: I think it's sleeping time toady
 Astrobytes: Cat petting time
 Chainman: yeah
 UndercoverToad: got a version which is 52% to 48% in local
 UndercoverToad: no idea how that translates to the arena
 SabertheLost: If the shadowsize is 2, then a tree size 3 get zero? Correct. But I´m looking at a board where blue prints get 17 but on board it should only get 12
 ddreams: lol, I have no faith in brutaltesting myself anymore
 ddreams: I'm happy I submitted this version without testingit
 ddreams: gave me like 50 ranks
 peerdb: what is this brutaltest youre talking about?
 ddreams: even if brutal said 36% or so wins
 UndercoverToad: play offline vs yourself, several games in parallel
 ddreams: peerdb a program that pits your bot against itself many times
 Chainman: SabertheLost you get sun points at the beginning of the day
 akagami101: lol
 Scarfield: trees only cast spooky shadows on trees of same size or smaller SabertheLost
 SabertheLost: Chainman. Is that that before or afte the sun is moved?
 ddreams: SabertheLost a size 2 tree does not spookyshadow a size 3
 SabertheLost: Is that a change of the rules from the first days?
 ddreams: no
 Scarfield: no
 ddreams: They will find the shadow on a cell spooky if any of the trees casting a shadow is of equal or greater size than the tree on that cell
 UndercoverToad: still 200 players missing to hit the count of last contest
 SabertheLost: ah crap another rule that hidden in text.  Or was it explained different in the youtube viedo? I think that viedo might done more harm...
 Scarfield: "They will find the shadow on a cell spooky if any of the trees casting a shadow is of equal or greater size than the tree on that cell. " last part of Sun &amp; shadows
 ddreams: the text really emphasizes the wrong things
 Scarfield: ^
 Scarfield: yea you have to read carefully
 ddreams: Helping the wood spirits are LESSER SPIRITS hiding among all the trees.They will find the shadow on a cell SPOOKY if any of the trees casting a shadow is of equal or greater size than the tree on that cell.
 ddreams: the bolding is just misdirection
 ddreams: In between each day, the sun MOVES to point towards the next direction
 Scarfield: :o didnt even notice
 Scarfield: it is hard to write a concise and easy to understand statement though
 SabertheLost: That makes my whole algo bad. 
 Scarfield: good news, "easy fix" to gain in rank maybe&#160;;)
 SabertheLost: I think I was confused that the distance did not matter and assumed that distance ment also size
 SabertheLost: and no my algo sucks.&#160;:) 
 Scarfield: xD
 SabertheLost: It´s just number of trees shading an square
 Scarfield: no no, not the number of trees, only their sizes matters
 Chainman: alright, I'm getting 40 ms with a very simple beam search of width=1 and depth = 4 lol.  Much better than last time.  But I'm also not consider opponent, and not consider shadows yet.
 Chainman: I need to count the number of nodes I can get this time. 
 ddreams: 4 days?
 Chainman: nope
 Chainman: 4 actions
 Chainman: wait and my width was 1
 Chainman: wtf, that's sad
 ddreams: better compare nodes after wait
 ddreams: *for move selection
 InternalErrror: Why is the Python Interpreter here still not 3.8 or higher?
 InternalErrror: Walrus would be great for Clash of Code shortest mode
 struct: its 3.9.2&#160;?
 InternalErrror: no, walrus operator is always marked as invalid syntax
 InternalErrror:&#160;:=
 struct: but does it compile?
 InternalErrror: no, syntax error
 UndercoverToad: can still work
 UndercoverToad: highlighting is not the same version as the language itself
 jacek: who needs walrus, sounds pascalic
 struct: it compiles
 InternalErrror: It's assignment + return the value in one operator
 jacek: oh i know! CG needs new language, delphi!
 UndercoverToad: that's Pascal in OOP
 UndercoverToad: on paradigm that's really missing: Prolog
 ZarthaxX: hate prolo
 ZarthaxX: g
 annaproxy: Yess prolog
 UndercoverToad: never tried it
 ZarthaxX: used it on uni
 ZarthaxX: damn man
 UndercoverToad: just saying: we have a lot of OOP, some functional
 UndercoverToad: prolog is a thing for itself
 struct: whats prolog used for?
 CouscousAgha: can i debug print in the console output?
 UndercoverToad: prolog is a logic language
 InternalErrror: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8064795-fd40-4332-a538-e5b9e35dc69d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e8064795-fd40-4332-a538-e5b9e35dc69d</a>
 UndercoverToad: do you know the Einstein riddle?
 struct: true ai?
 struct: no
 reCurse: Ew prolog
 UndercoverToad: where different persons live in houses, have favorite food and nationality, houses have colors
 UndercoverToad: you are given a bunch of relations
 UndercoverToad: and have to find the actual assignments
 UndercoverToad: for prolog you just give the relations and the program will solve it for you

 InternalErrror: what now it works
 InternalErrror: just one clash ago it didn't
 struct: cg staff is fast
 struct: they just updated based on feedback
 struct: ill check it afte contest euler
 ddreams: updated what?
 InternalErrror: insert * flash meme *
 ddreams: python version?
 InternalErrror: yeas
 UndercoverToad: obviously struct is trolling
 UndercoverToad: * it's sunday
 jacek: crashing is done fast
 struct: ok i Need to fix my damn bot
 ddreams: also changing python version in the just as a contest is finishing :D
 struct: I said this 3 hours ago
 ddreams: - in the
 UndercoverToad: i think i'm making mine worse
 UndercoverToad: or i was lucky before
 ddreams: doing mcts struct?
 struct: no
 struct: beam
 ddreams: thought you'd test it
 struct: Maybe I will
 UndercoverToad: top20 or delete
 struct: But I dont know duct
 struct: and I think i cant understand it
 ddreams: I'm trying to get my fall mcts to work
 struct: I dont feel like top 20 is realistic
 ddreams: delete
 struct: maybe on next contest
 struct: im safe on this one
 jacek: tomorrows contest ends and we can finally go back to clashes, the main point of CG
 struct: ok its time for me to close the chat 
 struct: cya in 12 hours
 ddreams: ciao
 Donotalo: server becomes so slow during the last 24h of the contests, this is frustrating&#160;:(
 Donotalo: it takes a lot of time before knowing my new bot's position
 Donotalo: why don't CG do anything about it?
 DomiKo: what they can do?
 Donotalo: may be increase number of servers?
 DomiKo: and who will pay for this?
 Donotalo: just thinking, as it happens always
 Donotalo: ha ha, yea, that's the question
 skotz: maybe get some corporate sponsors
 Donotalo: in last 4-6 hours, i hesitate to submit any new code because of this slowness
 ddreams: I'd pay for it personally
 ddreams: cost of joining a contest instead of working for clients is pretty high 
 skotz: same here so long as it was "support the contest" and not in any way "pay to win"
 ddreams: of course
 ddreams: just adding some servers during the contest period
 UndercoverToad: in the past contests were even sponsored
 UndercoverToad: maybe 20 companies. you could select some that may contact you for a job
 UndercoverToad: mostly in fr
 reCurse: I'm pretty sure you'd need to pay a lot before it starts making a difference
 reCurse: Clouds aren't cheap
 ddreams: not that expensive either
 jacek: you just need to vapor some water. ezpz
 darkhorse64: I leave the contest for a long weekend. When I return, the first has a 7 point ELO lead. Is there an anti doping control scheduled for tomorrow&#160;?
 Illedan: I would pay for more games through the cg platform for myself
 MSmits: they need to monetize us
 DomiKo: pay to play?
 Illedan: Nah, just for a serious amout of extra games
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 :D
 Illedan: Without the new restrictions
 Astrobytes: The new restrictions are fking awful
 jacek: new restrictions?
 MSmits: only for losing cg bench i think. I havent hit the limit just from trying the IDE
 Illedan: I hit it the first day
 Illedan: when all games were fast
 MSmits: hmm, i guess  i am slow
 struct: I hit during testing
 ddreams: I'd pay for everyone to have a better experience.. don't think so many more servers would be needed
 darkhorse64: does that counter hiders&#160;?
 ddreams: like a 16-core 64gb machine costs like $180 per month
 ddreams: err, 180 for 14 days
 peerdb: what restrictions?
 ddreams: if you play too much in the IDE, you get locked out for a while
 peerdb: oh ive never had that happen
 peerdb: thanks
 Astrobytes: Try tweaking some constants in the IDE and playing matches. Dead in minutes
 Illedan: Max 600 a day
 ddreams: me neither, but I test mostly locally
 peerdb: 600 a day is fine.assume you spend 16 hours here a day (cus im a nerd), its 38 per hour
 peerdb: yeah i dont hit that
 Astrobytes: There are other limits. Plays per n seconds, minutes, hours
 peerdb: ah okay I didnt know
 MSmits: btw.. I rammed out my fastest mcts ever..  took me 2hrs, unfortunately it sucked compared to my beamsearch 
 BlitzProg: Hey MSmits
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ddreams: how many rollouts did you get?
 BlitzProg: I got My MCTS up too lol
 MSmits: 12k or so
 BlitzProg: oh my god, first turn?
 MSmits: no
 ddreams: did you try the seed cheat?
 MSmits: 2nd turn
 MSmits: whats that ddreams
 ZarthaxX: talking with the mcts master here BlitzProg what did you expect
 ddreams: don't check if it's legal to seed somewhere
 MSmits: mmh for use in mcts?
 ddreams: yep
 BlitzProg: Well I'm expecting at least to not feel so ridiculously bad in comparison lol
 struct: a bug that works
 struct: ...
 MSmits: ah, i gues that might work yes
 JudgeAL: r u guys talking about spring challenge?
 BlitzProg: but there I am, with my 330 rollouts turn 2
 MSmits: mine was just a SP mcts, not a 2p mcts. 
 Astrobytes: Yes JudgeAL
 BlitzProg: So is mine
 MSmits: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: MSmits i think that clocks has some good eval, besides using mcts
 JudgeAL: ahh i see, how do u train stuff and upload it?
 ZarthaxX: i dont think that's the real magic only
 MSmits: yeah, i am not saying that mcts wont work
 MSmits: i was hoping it could somehow benefit from not needing a midgame eval
 ZarthaxX: you mean *will* work
 MSmits: like beam does
 ZarthaxX: like super easily
 ZarthaxX: ahhhh
 ZarthaxX: agree
 Astrobytes: JudgeAL: Most of the search algos are online, I suspect there is at least one NN though. For that you need to train offline and embed weights
 ddreams: how about beam search until midgame?
 ddreams: I call it dream search
 MSmits: yeah i have been considering combining multiple searches, but dont have the time anymore
 BlitzProg: I am mentally exhausted about all of this, but there's some good news: there are 12 hours left
 Astrobytes: I think different searches (or evals) for different stages are appropriate for this
 Illedan: I have so many timers in my code :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: maybe i should add some
 Illedan: if Day &gt; Nif Num3 &gt; K...
 ddreams: lol, the missing piece
 ddreams: timers
 JudgeAL: ohh, dang just manually copy and paste weights.
 ddreams: why do you call that timers though?
 MSmits: because he uses 1 eval until time runs out
 MSmits: then uses another
 ddreams: oh
 reCurse: Losses are often suspiciously bunched together.
 reCurse: I think servers are up to something
 Illedan: Isn't 80 ms enough to solve that?
 reCurse: You think I have milliseconds to spare
 reCurse: Besides I've seen jumps in the 30ms
 Astrobytes: 30 :o
 ddreams: it seems like you can afford a couple of losses without losing rank
 Illedan: I think he really wants 100% win :P
 ddreams: yeah, jk
 BlitzProg: MCTS sounds like it won't help me past legend, I'll see if I can set up a BS with the time I have left
 reCurse: Sorry wasn't meant as whining
 reCurse: I'm just puzzled at what's going on
 ddreams: didn't take it like that, was just jabbing at your complete domination
 reCurse: When something's too weird I need to know why
 MSmits: jabbing is all we got left reCurse :P
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 BoBot: has this kind of domination in a contest occurred before? :D
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MSmits: mmh i did halfway through a contest once
 MSmits: then the other guy caught up and we dominated together
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 MSmits: and i ended 2 :P
 Illedan: Which was that?
 MSmits: xmas
 ZarthaxX: joli 1 rigth
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: no nn's though
 MSmits: this is something else
 MSmits: dont think anyone has done this in an official contest here
 Illedan: Wont know for sure until recalc
 Illedan: Someone might appear
 struct: im still hiding
 MSmits: we can see you
 reCurse: Good thing there's no PS5 on this one
 Illedan: haha
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: my current bot is from testing phase
 ddreams: ps5?
 Zenoscave: lol Do you still fear the dapo with this bot?
 reCurse: Just saying
 MSmits: reCurse didnt you also have a huge lead on ice and fire?
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Maybe
 MSmits: I think it was +5 for a long time there too
 Zenoscave: Ninja remember Ice and Fire?
 ClockSort: i'm getting '-' timeouts at random, are others seeing this
 MSmits: maybe not at the very end though
 reCurse: Yes
 NinjaDoggy: I will always remember ice and fire&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: teccles and I were like 0.5 apart fighting for first
 NinjaDoggy: and then recurse comes in with a +4 lead or something&#160;:(
 Illedan: xD
 reCurse: See that couldn't happen now
 MSmits: yeah thats what i remember
 reCurse: I was batching all day
 BlitzProg: Maybe I should write another PHP heuristic
 Cappefra: recurse you're insane
 DomiKo: he always was
 NinjaDoggy: nah recurse is noob, not even 42 points :P
 ZarthaxX: famous last words :D
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;;)
 Illedan: It's like the rest of us is not even trying..
 Cappefra: Everybody fighting for 0.2 points and there's a bot leading by +7
 reCurse: Here's a better way to put it, you have a better life balance
 ddreams: uhh..
 Cappefra: when did you start with this bot, out of curiosity?
 Illedan: I wish that was the tradeoff
 reCurse: Day 1
 Cappefra: I didn't see your name until like yesterday
 ddreams: he was coding in secret
 Numby: reCurse when did you do first submission
 reCurse: Yesterday
 Numby: LOL
 ddreams: struggling to get through wood league
 Cappefra: hahahaha
 reCurse: I was hiding but did zero batch
 Numby: that's so stealthy
 reCurse: Just FYI
 ddreams: truth, but only because servers were basically broken
 JBM: we believe you
 NinjaDoggy: zero batch?
 ZarthaxX: wow
 ddreams: when you say batch, do you mean playing with an alt?
 reCurse: Maybe a few hundred of IDE plays total
 ZarthaxX: didnt test against anyone??
 reCurse: Just to validate it was working
 ZarthaxX: beast recurse
 JBM: well that's certainly more than *I* lol
 Cappefra: so you submitted in wood 2 with your legend bot
 reCurse: Doesn't work
 Numby: that's so insane :D
 reCurse: In bronze though yeah
 Cappefra: ok
 dloukadakis: you can get to gold by playing randomly lol
 Numby: did you submit simple bot to get to gold then submit your main directly?
 ddreams: you could have detected wood leagues based on trees
 Cappefra: did the bronze boss self-destruct after that?
 Cappefra: did it say "woah chill bruh, take it easy jeez"
 MSmits: ddreams he needs the codespace 
 MSmits: no fancy unnecessary code
 reCurse: Final bot minus a change or two in bronze
 reCurse: I encountered something funny
 reCurse: But that's a story for another day
 NinjaDoggy: hey recurse you should start working on PM now that first is secured&#160;:)
 reCurse: I did, inspiration is a bit dry though
 kovi: rollover in uint8_t score or sun?
 Cappefra: whar's pm again?
 ddreams: postmortem
 Astrobytes: post mortem (report)
 reCurse: Oh if it was just rollover
 NinjaDoggy: recap of your bot
 Cappefra: aah ok lol didn't get the joke
 jacek: trollover?
 Astrobytes: That is what I call a solid submit reCurse.
 NinjaDoggy: whelp he got to 42...
 NinjaDoggy: nah recurse is noob not even 42.69 :P
 Vova_s: does anyone know, how the score is calculated?
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: NinjaDoggy hahahaa
 Astrobytes: TrueSkill algo Vova_s
 ZarthaxX: astroooo!
 Astrobytes: zarthaaaa
 ddreams: Illedan resubmits.. let's see
 Astrobytes:&#160;!
 Illedan: Pff
 Illedan: Random changes
 Illedan: No motivation for 1 week doesn't help :D
 Astrobytes: I only went to gold because the Toad insisted
 Astrobytes: Was gonna go all in yesterday but, well, yesterday :P
 reCurse: I find that hard to believe given your previous statements
 reCurse: Did you decide to go all in yesterday today?
 Astrobytes: No I got gold the other day
 Astrobytes: And I was gonna give up, but was motivated yesterday until the server stuff
 1XC: :expressionless:
 reCurse: You were motivated? :o
 Astrobytes: Just been submitting random crap today
 Astrobytes: Not 'motivated' as such. Call it a buoyant enthusiasm.
 reCurse: I don't know if it baffles me more
 reCurse: :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 Codechaos: Will the spring challenge be playable after tomorrow? Don't have time to improve my bot any further right now
 NinjaDoggy: it will come back as a multi
 peerdb: yeah Codechaos, a few hours after it finishes it becomes available again
 NinjaDoggy: don't think it's instantly back though?
 NinjaDoggy: :O a few hours? :O
 Astrobytes: Yeah it will return as a regular multi at some point next day or so
 reCurse: Last time it was more or less right after rerun ended
 reCurse: If I recall
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 NinjaDoggy: oh cool
 peerdb: yeah after reruns
 Codechaos: That's great, thank you!
 peerdb: not that I'd know anything about reruns in legend but ye
 Illedan: I love how you simply give up when you lose reCurse :O 
 reCurse: FFF
 ashiknur: can we see the source code of top participants?
 Illedan: Like you assume I wont do anything stupid lol
 Astrobytes: No ashiknur
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557076400">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557076400</a>
 NinjaDoggy: @illedan nah the bot is just confused because it's never been there&#160;;)
 jacek: hm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aLp47jA_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aLp47jA_700bwp.webp</a>
 MSmits: is that a MTG meme?
 Astrobytes: ashiknur: there will be post-contest reports though
 jacek: maybe
 Illedan: Win 1 game in IDE vs re Curse. 10 loss on submit :rocket:
 Illedan: :explosion:
 reCurse: I give up
 reCurse: Also in real life
 reCurse: Dunno how to fix that
 reCurse: I tried
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: I think you're safe without fixing it. Multi might be a different story.
 MSmits: well if you have some codespace and want my beamsearch&#160;? :P
 MSmits: it ought to be better than suicide
 1XC: I keep getting fast and I hate fast 
 reCurse: Maybe with more time but now I'm fed up
 Astrobytes: Loads of codespace over here MSmits. Beam me up laddie!
 NinjaDoggy: recurse missed a win here? :O
 NinjaDoggy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557075088">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557075088</a>
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: lol
 NinjaDoggy: max seed = 2&#160;;)
 reCurse: Ok this one pisses me off actually lol
 reCurse: God damnit
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 Queuebee: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/afdb0f11-3fed-4e2a-b1c3-8c1886812fa5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/afdb0f11-3fed-4e2a-b1c3-8c1886812fa5</a>
 Queuebee: sorry wrong chat. I mean. I'm drunk. I mean. Just kidding.
 MSmits: count trees like this: 
 MSmits:  int seedCost = __builtin_popcountl(parent.trees[0] &amp; parent.owner);
 reCurse: Wait wait wait that game is a complete nonsense
 NinjaDoggy: why?
 JBM: that would have been my main question actually
 reCurse: It said guaranteed win at the end
 JBM: do you actually "understand" your AI's games?
 Illedan: He wrote an AI to understand it..
 reCurse: The answer is I try
 MSmits: decreasingly less these days JBM, he doesnt need to :P
 JBM: yeah a good position to be in
 Queuebee: Oo thanks MSmits
 CharmyRosewolf: Okay that's it gold 900+ ftw. I quit!
 MSmits: Queuebee thats for a bitboard in c++
 NinjaDoggy: reCurse it is guarenteed win... if you plant 1 more seed ;0
 peerdb: when doing beamsearch is it better to make the array of gamestates an array of pointers or nah?
 CharmyRosewolf: It was fun while it lasted. :D
 BoBot: that looked like a pretty extreme sun point collection by Magus
 reCurse: One sec panic debug session
 linjoehan: Ok time to start for real
 Astrobytes: It certainly was
 Astrobytes: BoBot
 Magus: extreme sun point collection&#160;?
 linjoehan: What's the meta before I begin?
 NinjaDoggy: ahh yes the typical 7 point lead panic debug session&#160;;)
 BoBot: havent seen any other bot play like that yet, maybe there are some exploitative opportunities 
 ddreams: linje: copy recurse's games
 RoboStac: it looks like an mcts that knows it's lost so all moves are bad and then lucks into recurse failing to convert
 RoboStac: especially given the debug prints
 BoBot: @Magus - your bot was banking 60+ sun points in the shared replay that you drew vs reCurse
 kovi: maybe no draw rule
 BoBot: I had not seen that strategy before
 Queuebee: Oo reCurse I see you joined the competition
 Queuebee: When did that happen
 Astrobytes: good spot robo
 BoBot: @RoboStac or that :D
 reCurse: Oh. I see.
 Magus: My bot only gather maximum of sun because this is the best way to maximize score + sun/3 at the end
 Magus: (since reCurse can't COMPLETE a tree before the end, there is no reason for my bot to complete a tree)
 reCurse: There was a bug
 reCurse: But the game is also a forced draw
 DomiKo: :scream:
 reCurse: Planting a seed costs 3 energy = 1 less point
 reCurse: So... all good I guess?
 kovi: 2
 kovi: 11-2=9
 DomiKo: yeah
 reCurse: And I'm a monumental shame
 JBM: why are you almost always red
 ddreams: red is closest to recurse than blue, doh
 Astrobytes: It's the allergies
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 reCurse: I'm blue on that replay
 JBM: i'm on your curent agent's last battles page
 ddreams: jbm, it's completely random
 ddreams: on the left means he's always winning
 JBM: oh right
 JBM: i forgot how to read that one
 JBM: thanks ddreams, i needed the readjustment
 Illedan: reCurse having 10+ people debugging his games
 Astrobytes: How many years JBM... :D
 JBM: too much, and counting
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 reCurse: I'll only fix that bug if there is another game where it happens
 NinjaDoggy: doesn't planting a seed cost 2 there?
 Astrobytes: Illedan - you're missing the public debugging/rubber ducking session. Fix it.
 reCurse: Yes yes
 reCurse: I can't math
 NinjaDoggy: because it would be your 3rd seed?
 JBM: ask pb4
 JBM: he's available this time
 reCurse: Pruning got a little too aggressive
 reCurse: It literally can't seed
 ddreams: that's my problem too, keep pruning the winning moves...
 peerdb: do you guys prune after each turn or after each day?
 JBM: every chance i get
 peerdb: how far do you prune?
 reCurse: In his case he may have pruned the contest
 peerdb: im pruning my sanity tbf
 Astrobytes: I always prune to just above the new bud.
 MSmits: well you're a professional
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: So it turns out my random thought of the other day kinda matters
 MSmits: what was that?
 reCurse: Assuming you have perfect play (not making implications here, bear with me for this example) and the opponent doesn't
 Astrobytes: Which one? You had a few iirc
 reCurse: You start in a position solved as a loss
 reCurse: How do you play?
 MSmits: oh right, i've had some time to think about that as well
 MSmits: did not find a solution myself
 MSmits: well some imperfect ones
 reCurse: I have a weaker variant of that problem I think
 Astrobytes: So maximising/drawing out the game length (As in Oware) doesn't work then
 MSmits: your bot hasn't learned to discriminate between bad states and really bad states
 RoboStac: I've always gone for the move with the most visits as usually that means the loss was hard to solve and maybe they'll miss it. Doesn't really work here as it just ends up spamming seeds
 reCurse: But that doesn't mean it's the good way
 reCurse: The theroetical best way is what the opponent expects least
 RoboStac: yeah
 reCurse: But defining that is...
 MSmits: what you can do is play the moves that have the most losing replies
 Astrobytes: A problem requiring more than 11 days
 RoboStac: I guess you'd possibly need to analyze it more like chess where keeping it as complicated as possible (keeping pieces on the board to have more options) is probably better?
 Astrobytes: MSmits that was what I was getting at with the Oware comment
 RoboStac: though again hard to apply that here
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Indeed
 Vova_s: you can go for the path that will grant you less difference in points
 reCurse: Because some of the maps are god awful
 MSmits: Vova_s he might not be measuring points
 kurnevsky: There is a dynamic komi technique, but not sure how well it  will work here&#160;:)
 kurnevsky: Allows to maximize score in loosing positions.
 RoboStac: yeah, but that probably doesn't maximise winning chances 
 reCurse: Supervised learning on top 10 maybe lol
 reCurse: The contempt NN
 MSmits: mmh thats sort of what i do :P
 Astrobytes: It might work if the opponent blunders, even to force a draw
 MSmits: your best bet is to have a bot so good, it wont get into losing situations
 reCurse: See my previous point about god awful maps
 ThunderbirdOne: ah, just my luck
 ThunderbirdOne: forgot about this comp
 Astrobytes: yeah
 RoboStac: yeah, but that only works for one of us
 ThunderbirdOne: i remember 11hours before it ends
 MSmits: right, only one person can have a bot that never loses&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Wondered where you went ThunderbirdOne
 ThunderbirdOne: haha
 reCurse: A swindling AI would be pretty funny
 ThunderbirdOne: i got distracted
 ThunderbirdOne: and then discord became a thiing
 ThunderbirdOne: and life
 Chainman: my heuristics doesn't really work with beam search 
 ThunderbirdOne: haven't really been coding much outside workhours either
 Astrobytes: You were fixing your house last time iirc
 ThunderbirdOne: aye, ground floor is pretty much done
 ThunderbirdOne: saving for all the rest now lulz
 ThunderbirdOne: shit is so expensive&#160;:')
 AntiSquid: hi ThunderbirdOne how's life&#160;?
 ThunderbirdOne: pretty good actually
 ThunderbirdOne: anything i missed here? :D
 AntiSquid: awesome, glad to hear
 Astrobytes: haha, nice, you'll get it done eventually
 AntiSquid: you missed a lot of frustration imo with this contest, pretty lucky actually to come when it ends :P
 ThunderbirdOne: oh lol
 ThunderbirdOne: how come?
 AntiSquid: it's my opinion .
 ThunderbirdOne: lulz
 AntiSquid: it's not a fun game imo
 ddreams: my frustration was only about the servers
 Astrobytes: imo it's the contest that no-one really likes but did it anyway.For me.
 ddreams: game was nice enough
 ThunderbirdOne: Haven't seen our Russian friend in the chat tonight... (I even forgot his name)
 Astrobytes: Personally speaking.
 AntiSquid: hah that's me astro .
 ddreams: I liked that you could get far without search
 ThunderbirdOne: Wood battles are so slow btw
 ThunderbirdOne: holy smokes
 wlesavo: Astrobytes thats basically summarize my view on this :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: madao is MIA most of the time if that's who you mean
 ThunderbirdOne: right, Maddy
 ThunderbirdOne: MIA, that's unlike him
 ThunderbirdOne: good to see the regulars are still around though
 ZarthaxX: hey ThunderbirdOne!!!
 AntiSquid: he's usually here before contest starts and then disappears
 ZarthaxX: oh wlesavo alive :O
 reCurse: We're up to a count of 2
 ThunderbirdOne: i havent been here in a year or something
 reCurse: Stop it
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: I'm glad I have a few supporters of this view lol
 ThunderbirdOne: Hiya ZarthaxX!
 ZarthaxX: how are you maaaaan
 ThunderbirdOne: pretty good, found some spare time and noticed the comp :D might as well
 ZarthaxX: doing it?
 ThunderbirdOne: i'm just glad people still remember me tbh&#160;:')
 ZarthaxX: last second legend?
 ZarthaxX: cant forget the rocket
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 ThunderbirdOne: going through the first league now&#160;:')
 ZarthaxX: haha ok
 ThunderbirdOne: winning every battle, but its slow so... just waiting
 ZarthaxX: rush gold&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Count of 2 reCurse?
 wlesavo: ZarthaxX i missed first half, and im pretty slow, so yeah, half alive i would say =) 
 reCurse: Say the name 3 times...
 ThunderbirdOne: going to bed in a bit i think... conference next 2 days (digital though)
 Astrobytes: reCurse: Ah gotcha :D
 Zenoscave: we really should stop pinging the curse
 ZarthaxX: wlesavo oh rushing legend?
 reCurse: I wasn't worried about that
 AntiSquid: reCurse so it's a 3rd time 
 ZarthaxX: ThunderbirdOne sounds exhausting :P
 Astrobytes: No you missed the point
 Zenoscave: * &lt;--- point
 ThunderbirdOne: what league is CatBoss btw?
 Astrobytes: I'm gold, thanks for asking
 reCurse: Most awesome boss name
 wlesavo: nah, i gave up on legend, cant improove my beam search anymore, may be ill finish it after reading some pms. top gold is fine  
 reCurse: Bronze
 ThunderbirdOne: oh okay
 ThunderbirdOne: hard to get past bronze?
 ThunderbirdOne: doable in a couple of hours?
 Astrobytes: No and yes
 ThunderbirdOne: alright, nvm then&#160;:')
 Chainman: crap my beam search is way worse than not doing it rn.
 Astrobytes: You can definitely get Silver at least
 wlesavo: i got gold with completely broken shadows 
 Astrobytes: I got gold without any shadows
 wlesavo: broken worse then none :smiley:
 Chainman: what are shadows?
 Chainman: :stuck_out_tongue:
 AntiSquid: ThunderbirdOne just throw in a bunch of random conditions, make sure 50% of them are bugged and you will promote easily
 ThunderbirdOne: cool cool
 ThunderbirdOne: im in Wood 1 now...
 Chainman: I did the beam search, but according to my eval, it doesn't know what to do.  Like I need to redo my eval completely.  
 ddreams: Chainman make sure your beamsearch isn't bugged first
 Chainman: it's not it's choosing correctly
 Astrobytes: gn wlesavo
 Chainman: but i had a bunch of if, else in my eval that would depend on if it was the beginning, middle or end of game. 
 ddreams: when choosing the action, you should only compare full days, not same depths
 ddreams: ie. choose best action from wait nodes at same day
 ddreams: comparing nodes for different days is not working well
 Chainman: oh crap, that's genius I believe, thanks
 Chainman: yeah because your heuristics can depend on the day.
 Chainman: especially mine. 
 ddreams: the IDE should have a swap sides button
 Ashargin: I've been stuck in top gold for days. Can't find the right heuristics to beat the boss...
 ymoukhli: same
 ddreams: just fixing bugs and misunderstandings was more than enough to get me past the gold boss
 ddreams: was struggling next to it for a long time too
 MomoLand: hey 
 MomoLand: any interesting projects out there you doing&#160;? 
 Chainman: using beam search to beat gold boss?
 Numby: So I have consistently this 55ms spike on turn 6 or 7 and I cant figure out what causes it&#160;:( I tried timing each of my big functions and sometimes it's one function sometimes its another where the spike occurs. It's also weird that this only happens early in the game
 MomoLand: what gold boss guys&#160;? 
 PiterYeh: ddreams i with i could send your advice about day nodes to my past self 10 hours in the past. I'll try that now, thanks
 Numby: Because of the spike I gotta keep my timeout to 50ms or I go over the limit
 ddreams: gl PiterYeh, still time&#160;:)
 Chainman: the day nodes is key, in fact.  I think changing depth to number of days. 
 ddreams: you can rest when you're dead
 ashiknur: what's this?An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time."
 Ashargin: It's pretty self-explanatory
 ddreams: means you need to test locally for a bit
 Zenoscave: do you order moves in a certain some order?
 Chainman: Those who are near beating gold boss do you win sometimes? 
 Ashargin: Yeah I win like 30% of the time maybe
 Ashargin: I'm not sure what I should improve&#160;:/
 AeroFufel: Is it possible to make the chat bigger, in a separate page maybe? a hint anybody?
 Pduhard-: i was beating gold boss 75% times but was loosing against other top bots, stuck near top 10 for a while before the upgrade which got me legend
 ThunderbirdOne: lets see if this gets out of wood 1&#160;:')
 Chainman: yeah
 Chainman: my eval was giving score according to the day, and the actions, should it be giving score according to the gamestate with beam search?
 Chainman: hmmm I think it should work with actions.
 Chainman: just want it to look 2 days in advance maybe.
 linjoehan: ThunderbirdOne I did movelist[max(movelist.size()-1,1)] to get out of wood
 ThunderbirdOne: oh im just upgrading the biggest tree i have enough sun for at this point lol
 linjoehan: or was that min no it was min
 Illedan: ddreams&#160;:)
 ddreams: are you coming for me?
 Illedan: Above atm, but ranks are very close around us
 ddreams: we had one match so far, 152-115
 ddreams: I am almost ready to resubmit too
 Illedan: :scream:
 Illedan: I just yoloed some params
 ddreams: I changed nothing, but drastically sped up the algo
 ddreams: not sure if that translates into playing strength
 Illedan: Depends how you use that speed
 ddreams: I'm beam searching for 90ms, so it could help look a bit further
 Illedan: True, unless you prune the good moves early&#160;:)
 ddreams: yeah, I could perhaps widen the beam
 Michael_Howard: What's the best tactic for seed wars like this? I mean, it's annoying both sides equally, not sure if I should do anything in particular. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557125733">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557125733</a>
 ddreams: well, in the end you won
 Michael_Howard: Yeah but it sapped my arena bot's confidence &amp; now he's run out of the Gold top 100 &amp; won't go back.
 AndreMarasca: symmetrical game, I thought I was going to get stuck throwing seeds in the middle
 Chainman: I don't think you can use beam search if your eval function is scoring actions based only on gamestate day and not the gamestate. 
 ddreams: why not?
 ddreams: day is part of gamestate imo
 ashiknur: I was at 650 in gold and I submitted an upgraded code for a better hope and I tucked at 1235. :persevere:
 Chainman: yeah but that is the only thing I'm using from gamestate.
 Chainman: it's like my algo sees a really good action on day 3, but there are multiple paths there and it chooses the wrong one.
 Chainman: let's say I'm looking 2 days in advance.
 Michael_Howard: AndreMarasca yeah kinda kaleidoscopic.
 Chainman: normally on day 1 I'd prefer to grow tree to size 2. 
 Chainman: But it sees that on day 3 there is a equivalent good score for the path that starts with just waiting on day 1&#160;:(
 ddreams: why do those have the same score if you think it's worse?
 ClockSort: i had that problem in fall2020 challenge. it would see a good state in future and start with a REST action.
 ClockSort: my simple solution here was to just break ties in GROW -&gt; COMPLETE -&gt; REST order
 Illedan: Why not add value to the beams along the way?
 Zenoscave: what do you mean ille?
 ddreams: as in longer sequence is better?
 Illedan: As in doing something earlier is more score
 Zenoscave: got it.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what's recurse's secret?
 ddreams: win all the fights
 ddreams: sshh
 BoBot: it is obvious by the name, isn't it? ^^
 AeroFufel: A friendship with the tester and an early start ))   or kidding ))
 ProG_r_aM_m_er: I think he found the finite number of possible actions&#160;;)
 ddreams: I find that incredibly hard to balance, Illedan
 ddreams: often waiting really is better
 ClockSort: you have 1000ms during the first turn, so just explore all possible future game states during it
 Astrobytes: *just*
 ClockSort: is my bot getting worse or is top-20 getting a lot tougher over the past 6 hours?
 Chainman: waiting a lot
 natofp: what is happening if you submit code 5 mins before end of the contest and not all battles are plated?
 natofp: played*
 RoboStac: it'll finish playing all the battles
 ClockSort: they get plated after deadline
 ddreams: you risk it all
 natofp: ok
 natofp: just battles get played right?
 natofp: and after this
 natofp: this will be the final position?
 ddreams: I did that in legend once, top 20 or delete yolo, and it just kept timing out and I ended up at the very bottom
 BoBot: you might win the contest with 100% winrate ^^
 natofp: xD
 RoboStac: yes (there are some extra battles played between the top 100 in legend once all bots have finished)
 natofp: so there is a cutoff
 natofp: like
 natofp: &gt; 100 players are fixed
 natofp: and &lt;= 100 players are playing to permute their order possibly?
 RoboStac: I'm not actually sure what the rules are on the 100 boundary 
 ProG_r_aM_m_er: when i beat silver, i already beat half of gold
 RoboStac: my guess is if you are just outside the top 100 your score is still affected as you can be used as an opponent 
 ClockSort: @PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER when i beat gold boss, i also beat 70% of legend too :P
 ProG_r_aM_m_er: if you play against yourself and you sometimes win/loose, in the beginning shadows determine victory
 ProG_r_aM_m_er: yeah, well maybe in the future I will have more time and better strategies to work out
 Chainman: interesting, it thinks I can grow infinite times on my second turn. 
 ClockSort: maybe it is right
 Illedan: Cached the cost?
 ddreams: forgot to set it to dormant
 ddreams: early on I found I planted several seeds at the same location.. forgot to mark it as taken in the anytrees-bitboard
 Chainman: yeah I forgot the dormant
 Chainman: and my generator is generating impossible moves
 Illedan: The feeling when you hit play limit while tweaking some param on the last night -.-
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Chainman: couple o' bugs up in here.
 Chainman: ooooh no
 ddreams: that's crap illedan
 Astrobytes: Param tweaking in IDE pissed me off sooooooooooooooo much this contest
 Illedan: Yeah
 ddreams: is it allowed to share bot executables?
 Zenoscave: I don't think so ddreams
 Astrobytes: And it was introduced before it too. I thought I was going nuts when I was tweaking my other multi bots
 ddreams: don't see how that is cheating though
 Astrobytes: Between users I suppose ddreams but not publicly
 Astrobytes: And not during contest I'd say
 Zenoscave: and definitely not the source. just the binary
 Zenoscave: Although that doesn't stop decompilation i guess
 Astrobytes: ^
 ddreams: yeah, would be a stripped binary
 Astrobytes: Yeah, after contest that would be fine imo
 ProG_r_aM_m_er: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557155732">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557155732</a>  vs <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557156282">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557156282</a> random growing for gold bot :D
 ddreams: after contest you could share code I guess
 Astrobytes: No
 Zenoscave: No, Never code.
 Astrobytes: Snippets yes
 Zenoscave: This isn't commonly allowed in competitive code. Snippets are ok, like astro says
 Zenoscave: as long as it isn't too much
 ddreams: but streaming is encouraged tho?
 Zenoscave: For lower leagues.
 Astrobytes: Unless it's legend
 Zenoscave: You'll note many streams stop at gold at the very most
 Astrobytes: OR high gold etc
 Chainman: I want to see recurse stream :innocent:
 Astrobytes: He has one on youtube
 Zenoscave: after locam i doubt that'll happen lol
 Astrobytes: There was definitely not another stream about another game that isn't available.
 Chainman: I need to watch some videos and stream after contest actually to learn. 
 ddreams: I want to see him stream while coding his bronze bot
 Illedan: I learnt more from streaming than watching streams :P
 Chainman: what is locam?
 ddreams: Can you elaborate, Illedan?
 Numby: viewers give you tips?
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU9b445CpaM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU9b445CpaM</a>
 Illedan: I watched my own streams to learn more about myself 
 Chainman: he has two videos
 ddreams: that's an answer I didn't expect
 ddreams: what did you learn?
 Illedan: About my problem solving skills while under pressure of the stream. And how I tackle it. And about my english speaking
 Zenoscave: I remember your english was great from my pov.
 Zenoscave: despite mic problems&#160;;)
 Illedan: shhh
 Astrobytes: Tbh Illedan, your English speaking has been rather excellent. Volume skills however....
 Zenoscave: now help my stupid eval
 Illedan: Yeah, don't get me started on this new Mic i bought which is no good
 Astrobytes: -3suns
 Zenoscave: I swear the moment I get a good eval. top 20
 Zenoscave: it'll be on next sunday
 Illedan: I wish
 Illedan: I guess I'll accept 2nd NO&#160;:(
 theycallmedavid: End of game 100       50.00% 50.00%
 Astrobytes: Weird game. I still don't like it.
 ddreams: just wait until I submit my new bot and destroy myself
 Illedan: ^^
 Astrobytes: lol
 Zenoscave: The same bot I submit varies from 100-200
 Zenoscave: there are only 200 in Legend btw
 ddreams: ok, I'm submitting.. how long does it take for a run now?
 Zenoscave: about an hour
 Zenoscave: My guess
 Astrobytes: There is always that effect though zeno. Gold and legend, every contest.
 Zenoscave: That wide of variance though?
 ClockSort: a quarter of a run is good enough to get placement if you aren't near the top
 ddreams: here goes then
 Astrobytes: With many active submits possibly
 ddreams: only 340 now
 ddreams: so going down
 Illedan: Night time is upon us
 Illedan: And I was supposed to go to bed 40 min ago
 ddreams: 5 out of 10 initial battles
 Chainman: I hope to get top 300 sooon 
 ddreams: no sleep until you beat euler, remember
 Zenoscave: 3/ 10&#160;:/
 Illedan: I gave that up last sunday :P
 Illedan: But I can't accept 2nd NO. So here I am
 Astrobytes: The duties of life Illedan
 ddreams: hehe, you're 1st now
 Illedan: But this blocked IDE games will kill me
 ddreams: enjoy it
 Illedan: Screenshotted, printed and put on my wall
 CouscousAgha: what could happen if the timer hits 0 and someone is still submitting 
 ddreams: we're almost as many competitors as from italy
 Zenoscave: CouscousAgha you're immediately hated
 CouscousAgha: how so
 Chainman: lol
 Zenoscave: It won't let the legend rerun until all submits complete
 Astrobytes: ^
 Zenoscave: And pray no one knows your address if you submit last second in gold near top
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Zenoscave: Because that could mean a promotion and re submit in legend
 CouscousAgha: all legends will automatically resubmit?
 Zenoscave: Of course I aim to do this every time.top 100 legends get a re-ranking
 emagnidoc: hello guys, how can i approve a contribution from another user?
 Astrobytes: Yes. After the submits finish, the top 100 recalc
 Zenoscave: be a higher level emagnidoc
 Whatar: lvl 20 required
 Zenoscave: to keep from spam
 RoboStac: you can approve clashes after 50 public clashes can't you?
 emagnidoc: okay, thanks ... i was just wondering because i have the quest ... but couldnt find a way to solve it
 Astrobytes: Something like that yeah RoboStac
 Zenoscave: I think so
 Whatar: but you also need to be lvl 20 I think
 RoboStac: no, lvl 20 for puzzles
 RoboStac: 50 public clashes for clash
 Whatar: oh, ok, so I should be able to do it
 Whatar: let me check
 emagnidoc: @Whatar ... its the blue branch on the bottom right
 Zenoscave: emagnidoc just don't approve crap to complete a quest.
 Zenoscave: Put effort into finding a good one
 Astrobytes: Looks like Smits gave up, unless he has something up his proverbial sleeve.What about you RoboStac?
 Whatar: I don't have the button to approve it
 emagnidoc: @Whatar .. .same here thats why i was asking
 ddreams: looks like my new and improved bot is getting beat
 Whatar: oh, probably because its wip
 Whatar: let me search better
 RoboStac: Whatar - are you sure its not wip?
 RoboStac: ah
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6663b740cc323c93fdacb7cdb7c58ffb8402">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6663b740cc323c93fdacb7cdb7c58ffb8402</a>&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Standard procedure for CG bots ddreams&#160;:)
 RoboStac: I'm just trying random things to try and get back into the top 20 Astrobytes
 RoboStac: though its so slow I've no idea what is really happening
 cegprakash: someone plz share me a replay between me and Robostac
 cegprakash: someone in legend
 RoboStac: you aren't ranked high enough for me to find you
 Astrobytes: Fair. It's been ridiculously slow this time around.
 Astrobytes: It's not just me is it? 
 RoboStac: I gave up on my rewritten version and went back to wednesdays version as I couldn't make duct work
 linjoehan: I've never been able to get duct to work
 Whatar: any Idea on what my bot is doing wrong?
 Whatar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557169150">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557169150</a>
 linjoehan: well not fast enough to work
 Chainman: I think I'm gonig to call it quites on beam search 
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557174647">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557174647</a> wth 
 Astrobytes: Whatar: Firstly - it's losing. That's the wrong thing to do :P
 ddreams: I agree with Astro here
 ddreams: Stop doing that
 Whatar: True Astro
 Whatar: but that, I don't know how to fix
 Illedan: I'm off. GG everyone. Cya next contest ^^&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Honestly, count me out of serious discussions right now. My brain hurts :D
 Chainman: bye
 ddreams: gn illedan
 Whatar: gg
 Chainman: I think Whatar you were close though
 sasquatch: Question for someone in legendary. How do I get to play MiyazaBoss in the gold league? My best bot ranks about 50th in gold
 Astrobytes: see ya next week Illedan&#160;:)
 Chainman: have good dreams illedan
 Chainman: dream of your bot winning
 ddreams: get to top 5 or so sasquatch
 RoboStac: Whatar - you gather less sun on 17 of 24 days
 sasquatch: I see! Thanks ddreams
 RoboStac: mostly only by 1/2 (though day 12 is 9 vs 17) but it adds up
 ddreams: oh right, I removed all my move pruning as an experiment
 Whatar: yeah, my fat totoro tells me the difference in sun gains and I am a lot negative by the end of the match
 ddreams: is there any time it's better not to complete first thing in a round?
 ddreams: maybe if there's a seed location competition
 RoboStac: if you wait till opponent is asleep you might be able to get multiple nutrient bonuses in a row
 ddreams: you think the opponent decides to complete if you do it first thing in a round?
 ddreams: clocksort resubmitting too, I see
 ddreams: 6/10 initial battles this time
 ClockSort: i think i'm making my bot worse with every iteration :sweat_smile:
 ddreams: I wonder why the game doesn't start you with 0 trees... 
 ddreams: instead we have this asymmetric hell
 reCurse: How would that solve symmetry
 ClockSort: yeah @ddreams it's an unfair start
 reCurse: You'd end up with a PR1 situation
 reCurse: Nobody wants PR1
 ClockSort: but you have to start somerwhere
 ddreams: pr1?
 ClockSort: what's PR1?
 reCurse: Pacific Rift 1
 elderlybeginner: should be at lease rabbit round
 elderlybeginner: least
 ClockSort: not familiar with that situation
 Magus: Platinum Rift 1&#160;?
 reCurse: lol
 reCurse: Yes sorry
 reCurse: Mind went to strange place
 ddreams: it's impossible to get started?
 ddreams: if both players want the same starting spots
 reCurse: Everyone places on the best spot so you either have to suffer instant defeat or compromise to a worse position
 ddreams: right
 reCurse: There is no solving for symmetry with this game design
 reCurse: You need a new game
 Magus: PR1 is a 1v1v1v1 game and suffers a lot from "shifumi" games. Like if another player wants to spawn at the same place as you; you just lose the game and you can't do anything about it.
 ClockSort: yeah the sun is screwy, literally
 ddreams: yeah, that sucks more than this
 reCurse: PR1 had the same issue in 1v1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: recurse skips a seed to avoid a bad position, and next turn seeds next to a tree he's gonna complete...i';m like wtf
 ddreams: all battles run twice on the same map then?
 reCurse: Yes that would be the alternative
 reCurse: However it costs more
 reCurse: They used to do that
 reCurse: But that makes everything twice as slow
 reCurse: You want 2x slower submit?
 ClockSort: sign me up
 ddreams: Yes, and more servers
 Astrobytes: You were simply being very Pacific reCurse
 reCurse: I think my mind was on Pacific Rim
 reCurse: Not sure why
 Astrobytes: woo chat scroll, sorry
 Astrobytes: Yes, looks that way
 elderlybeginner: why it's makes submits x2 slower? Amount of fights could be the same
 reCurse: Maybe some inner need to have giant robots smash giant aliens
 Astrobytes: Never a bad thing imo
 reCurse: No because the result of a pair of games still counts as one game
 ddreams: why?
 reCurse: You need 2 games to determine the final result
 RoboStac: either way it still only gives you 45 opponents instead of 90 so the rankings will be much less stable
 reCurse: Well I guess that's the crappier alternative
 ddreams: I think adding a few servers seem like a good solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm unstable, I'm 1/2 the square of the root of the 2nd participle away from death by analysis
 Astrobytes: I think you should tell CG this ddreams. 
 ddreams: Like joining this contest has cost me maybe $10-15k
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 Whatar: healthcare?
 ddreams: not working for money
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google ads, rofl..i have no idea
 ddreams: my clients pay me a lot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: norwegians have OnlyFans?
 Astrobytes: Welllll.... I see your point. But... fun needs no repayment
 linjoehan: lol joining this contest has cost me sleep
 Westicles: ddreams, you dance on the webcam too?
 ddreams: yeah, but I'm totally willing to pay for a bit of server time
 ddreams: Westicles when I forget they are watching
 Astrobytes: I'm with you on that yeah
 Chainman: :sweat_smile:
 linjoehan: Ok first version of sim complete now where is that MCTS... just copy and paste and it should all work...
 Chainman: nice, I think I'm giving up on beam search, it's too hard for me.
 Chainman: I need to read/learn more 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My daughter is suggesting we play Minecraft, why does that sound less insane than poking wood sprites with hot pokers
 Chainman: hmmmmmm
 Astrobytes: Anyways, I'm outta here. Well done and good luck wherever it applies
 Astrobytes: RoboStac: submit looks good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf Astrobytes
 ddreams: ciao astro
 Chainman: have a good on 
 Chainman: one*
 RoboStac: Chainman - hypersonic is a good beam search game that is quite a bit simpler (no turn/day complexities) if you want to try it somewhere easier
 Westicles: Hah, look at tbali going for the language badge in objC
 DomiKo: or Fall Challange
 Chainman: okay thanks,
 Chainman: I think I need a simpler game yeah for starting.
 Westicles: And pardouin for clojure
 Westicles: Looks like Bash is the easiest one to go for now
 ddreams: what about pascal?
 Westicles: Some guy has gold already
 cegprakash: wth
 cegprakash: I started to win boss locally
 cegprakash: legend?
 ddreams: gl
 cegprakash: added 1 flag in constructor
 cegprakash: and that's changing my win rate drastically
 cegprakash: wth
 linjoehan: Man my MCTS only completes 25 games in time. Plan B then.
 ClockSort: get really lucky.
 solistice: ugggggh 7th in silver
 solistice: would really love to hit gold
 ddreams: share a replay, sol
 solistice: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557205507">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557205507</a>
 ddreams: what immediately stands out is that you're shadowing yourself a lot
 Whatar: yeah, even just planting your trees one block away can bring improvements
 Whatar: one more I mean
 Whatar: but if you can avoid shadowing yourself entierly, that would be good
 elderlybeginner: solistice the main rule is not to seed in the line
 ddreams: yeah, but just looking the neighbors of a seed if you have any trees there would probably improve it a lot
 ddreams: like whatar said
 ddreams: it's not so hard to go further, but...
 ClockSort: my MCTS has a problem when the opponent has 50 suns. it's not lucky enough to try the sequence where none are spent, so it thinks it is winning even when it will lose by a hoarding-sun opponent. any suggestions?
 Bozo: for those who implemented a MC tree search, what is its max depth&#160;? just out of curiosity 
 ClockSort: @Bozo i play to endgame
 Bozo: nice
 ddreams: ClockSort give a boost to wait actions?
 Bozo: my tree search is not a MC, and is quite short depth
 Bozo: its a shame, i didn't know MC before tonight
 Bozo:&#160;;-)
 ddreams: or ensure runs where no complete actions are taken until last day perhaps
 JohnCM: clocksort you can artificially increase the explore portion of the no action component in end game turns (day 19-24)
 ClockSort: :bulb:
 JohnCM: or if the opponent has no lvl 3 trees remaining, then give a huge boost to the explore component of the wait action
 JohnCM: cause typically ppl cash out all their trees they're not going to build new ones already
 ddreams: hoarders typically have many level 3 trees though
 JohnCM: haha then this strat doesn't really work
 JohnCM: cause in gold it is typically the fast cash out strategy
 ClockSort: when i am the opponent then everybody is a hoarder
 ClockSort: i cash out so fast that you must hoard to win :D
 ddreams: yeah, you probably induce it by grabbing all the nutrients
 ddreams: I think I finally found an actual eval improvement
 cegprakash: timer is red
 cegprakash: I'm doomed
 ddreams: still 8 hours, come on
 ddreams: lol Westicles
 ddreams: going for pascal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: finally beat the darn gold boss
 ClockSort: congrats @PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;!!
 ddreams: grats&#160;:)
 ddreams: just in time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only once gheesh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: be back later, groceries
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx tho
 Westicles: ddreams, I'll have to settle for top3, I don't have a silver
 ddreams: I wonder why I have a top 3 in a language ranking
 solistice: will cobol ever be supported?
 solistice: just asking for a friend
 sgalasso: How the hell is it possible that some bot manage to have a good base score AND cumulate sun at endgame, just how
 ddreams: lots of sun I guess
 sgalasso: Yes i know, but I mean my algo try to use optimaly sun I ahve during the match, theirs do it plus they accumuate x) I have no clue about how they do it
 ddreams: compare how much sun you and they have accumulated on the first complete
 sgalasso: almost same, it's mainly at the endgame
 ddreams: when does it start to differ?
 sgalasso: ~17 in average I would say
 ddreams: perhaps you're undervaluing the bonus values for score
 solistice: sweet, I'm gonna reach gold! :D thanks for the neighbor seed tip!
 ddreams: hard to guess
 ddreams: np
 peerdb: well, here goes nothing! lets push
 .TN: ssa
 .TN: hello
 AlexanderGuk: where top players usually post their PMs? would like to read some
 ddreams: forum
 AlexanderGuk: just as replies to some admin thread after the contest?
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/62">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/62</a> for example
 AlexanderGuk: cool, thank you!
 theycallmedavid: I'm getting better at beating myself. I wonder if it will work on others too.
 aCat: yes
 aCat: they will be better at beating you too
 peerdb: :sad:
 theycallmedavid: Yes, against the boss that is exactly what happens
 struct: hello
 struct: im back for the all nighter
 struct:&#160;:'(
 ddreams: then there's two of us
 ddreams: I wish my improvements actually improved things
 struct: ping me if any action is needed in chat
 struct: it will be minimized
 ddreams: you got a plan?
 struct: a plan?
 ddreams: for the last 7 hours
 struct: nope
 struct: :D
 ddreams: spamming tweaks until the IDE locks you out?
 struct: im not using ide to test stuff
 struct: I run it localy
 ddreams: I gave up trying mcts when I thought I saw some eval improvements
 ddreams: but they don't pan out
 Lucky30_: i am tired, and tomorrow i have an interview, should i keep going with the contest, or just give up
 Cjx_1: this contest prly wont pay ya friend :P
 ddreams: clearly the best option to bomb the interview because you were so passionate about coding
 Cjx_1: lol
 peerdb: submit you contest code for the interview
 Lucky30_: hhhhhh
 Lucky30_: you guys sure now how to cheer up someone
 Lucky30_: i guess i could try my luck at legend after the contest
 ddreams: if you were in top gold, I'd probably have stayed if I were you&#160;:)
 Lucky30_: 764 gold =&gt;top 1 does not sound like possible right now
 cegprakash: I am unable to test in local arena code against boss it automatically switches to IDE code
 ddreams: but you're probably quite far off
 cegprakash: is it a feature or a bug
 ddreams: maybe you're pushing replay in same conditions
 cegprakash: yes
 ddreams: same conditions include the players
 peerdb: ^^
 cegprakash: I want to test under same conditions with arena bot
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 peerdb: you can save the seed
 ddreams: then go to options and choose manual
 Lucky30_: anyways, i tryed hard in this contest, but not hard enought, next time i will do better
 Lucky30_: goodluck everyone
 ddreams: gl to you in your interview too
 Lucky30_: thanks ddreams
 stefan-gg: im so stuck in silver do you guys have any general tips&#160;?
 ddreams: don't seed next to your own trees
 peerdb: gl everyone, might check in in the morning, but i need some sleep
 stefan-gg: is it worth to occupy the green area early on&#160;?
 ddreams: no, it gets shaded a lot
 peerdb: it can be stefan-gg, but most importantly, space your trees evenly throught the board
 cegprakash: I'm at 40 points in gold and boss is at 47.. is there anything amazing I can do to get 7 points :P
 peerdb: pay thibaud
 ddreams: win 100% of your fights
 ddreams: that's be amazing
 ddreams: and give you 7 points or more
 stefan-gg: yea you are right but this is my first competiton so i was kinda scared a little bit
 peerdb: cegprakash is it just me or are top 150 gold mostly 50-50
 cegprakash: ddreams funny
 cegprakash: I'll laugh after contest
 ddreams:&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: omg i copied recurses strategy and have won first 18 games of submit in gold :O
 ddreams: what's his strategy again?
 AllYourTrees: my previous best was 500 in gold lol
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: what is his strategy :D&#160;?
 Pick8chu: yeah what's his?
 Numby: teach us to copy 
 AllYourTrees: watch his games&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: aww i lost some, maybe not a perfect copy haha
 Pick8chu: he barely put seeds on the middle
 ProG_r_aM_m_er: I think I cannot improve my code anymore top 400 good enough for my if then else code
 Numby: i could use some good if-else for my pruning right now
 AllYourTrees: ya i gave up on my approach
 ddreams: it's not a dumb idea
 CouscousAgha: my if then code made it to top 115 legend
 struct: nice
 CouscousAgha: im satisfied with that
 AllYourTrees: nice!!
 Pick8chu: you made your if then to top 115?
 Pick8chu: that's really impressive
 CouscousAgha: yes
 Numby: teach us heuristics :D
 CouscousAgha: and this is my first coding game challenge ever
 CouscousAgha: Numby notebook and a pen
 CouscousAgha: and start brainstorming 
 CouscousAgha: you will notice a pattern and just prototype it 
 CouscousAgha: notice repeated processes 
 CouscousAgha: turn them into functions 
 CouscousAgha: test and see what u did wrong
 CouscousAgha: and repeat
 Cjx_1: ok, here towards the end. Who cares about highest elo. Who has the most dubmits. Ik its not me with a measley 80
 Cjx_1: *submits
 ddreams: 26 submits
 KelvinAndHubbles: ... 149
 struct: 27
 AllYourTrees: wow this might actually do it
 codingWhale: Congrats.&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: OMG last battle was loss against boss but IT DID IT
 Cjx_1: &lt;3 big grats friend
 ddreams: gz
 struct: grats
 Queuebee: allyourtrees
 Queuebee: congratz!
 AllYourTrees: tyty!!
 CouscousAgha: congrats!
 Queuebee: nice name for this challange :P
 CouscousAgha: welcome to legend
 AllYourTrees: haha i may or may not have changed my name just for it :D
 AllYourTrees: ty CouscousAgha
 cegprakash: AllYourTrees what did u add
 AllYourTrees: i copied reCurse's strategy as best I could &gt;.&gt;
 cegprakash: oh come on :P
 cegprakash: now plz share a replay
 cegprakash: with me vs recurse
 ddreams: lol Illedan sneaky resubmits
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557297550">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557297550</a>
 ddreams: not bad
 BrunoFelthes: Are you using search, or most of heuristics AllYourTrees?
 AllYourTrees: only heuristics
 struct: bruno any progress?
 AllYourTrees: well theres some rules that require a check of next round
 AllYourTrees: idk if you consider that search BrunoFelthes
 ddreams: that's still heuristics imo
 AllYourTrees: fair
 cegprakash: AllYourTrees plz give a replay me vs recurse
 AllYourTrees: i linked above cegprakash!
 cegprakash: that's u vs recurse
 AllYourTrees: oh wait what do you want?
 AllYourTrees: ohhh yourself
 Westicles: cegprakash whatever joke you are making, we don't get it
 cegprakash: yes me vs recurse
 cegprakash: choose me in the IDE
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557299811">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557299811</a>
 AllYourTrees: cegprakash ^
 cegprakash: thx
 Queuebee: How did you get that O_o
 AllYourTrees: i guess you can play 2 players that aren't yourself in the web ide Queuebee
 BrunoFelthes: no struct, i didnt work today
 ZarthaxX: gave up bruno?
 CouscousAgha: cegprakash you should work on your seeds
 BrunoFelthes: sort of it... i was trying to do a MCTS, but the GC killed me
 struct: bruno you dont like c++?
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 BrunoFelthes: no... i tried to learn rust, but i m not confortable with it yet
 Numby: I had same issue and had to do rediculous things with a pool of nodes and copying into existing nodes
 ddreams: it's not such a big step from C# to C++
 AllYourTrees: rust MCTS is a pain
 Numby: But it's not very good cuz of all the extra crap I put in
 kresteodymium: hi guys
 kresteodymium: hello world
 struct: hi
 AllYourTrees: :wave:
 kresteodymium: hi struct and AllYourTrees
 struct: my ears :scream:
 ddreams: pinging with headphones?
 struct: yes
 CouscousAgha: alright i guess that's it for me
 CouscousAgha: this week was a rollercoaster but im proud of my accomplishments 
 CouscousAgha: see you in the next time boys and gals 
 CouscousAgha: thank you for hosting this contest!
 AllYourTrees: cyas CouscousAgha! nice work!
 AllYourTrees: don't forget to read the post mortems CouscousAgha
 CouscousAgha: oh where and when should I expect that&#160;? AllYourTrees
 ddreams: the forum
 AllYourTrees: ppl post their approaches on the forum in the days after it ends
 ddreams: most of the top players explain what they did
 CouscousAgha: idk if im eligible enough to do one myself
 AllYourTrees: oh anyone can, ppl in gold/silver/legend all post
 Numby: where do people post
 ddreams: even bronze
 AllYourTrees: i think they usually email out the forum link
 BlitzProg: I'll definitively put one to write how ashamed I am of my performance
 struct: any changes I do, do nothing&#160;:(
 ddreams: I'm following in All_YourTrees' footsteps and copying rules from the cursed 
 eulerscheZahl: happy 4am
 Queuebee: No u
 struct: hi euler 
 AllYourTrees: nice ddreams :D
 ZarthaxX: hey toad
 CouscousAgha: where's the gold boss at now?
 codingWhale: And I thought, you go to bed to a proper time, e... :upside_down:
 struct: I wont go to sleep until I get legend
 ddreams: you know how old people wake up in the middle of the night?
 ZarthaxX: struct but :P
 CouscousAgha: struct arent you top 50? lol
 AllYourTrees: drink a lot of water before you fall asleep?
 struct: im 51th
 struct: not good enough
 struct: I wanted top 50
 eulerscheZahl: i do codingWhale. getting up is another story
 struct: oh im 50
 struct: bye gn
 AllYourTrees: lol!
 CouscousAgha: LMAO
 codingWhale: Wow, that's impressive.&#160;:)
 CouscousAgha: well u will get a rerun so dw
 ZarthaxX: there will be a rerun struct :D
 Queuebee: what's a rerun
 struct: Tshirt is so close
 struct: yet so far&#160;:(
 CouscousAgha: u might keep the top 50 as well as lose it!
 ZarthaxX: rerun started from actual positions tho right?
 eulerscheZahl: in my bed right now. with laptop
 struct: yes ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: struct 30 ranks lmao
 struct: euler send help
 ZarthaxX: so there is no chance to get top 20 from top 50 structo
 Westicles: maybe pb 4 will push you
 BlitzProg: I feel tired and a bit sick, but there's 6 hours left
 struct: 6 hours is enough time
 struct: I could have writen my current bot in that time
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 BlitzProg: And that's what I'm doing
 ddreams: rewriting struct's bot?
 ddreams: hm
 struct: no lol
 eulerscheZahl: will this be another BlitzProg story about trying to get legend the last night?
 eulerscheZahl: you always write these as your post mortems
 struct: euler I even rented aws machine
 struct: to test lol
 AllYourTrees: :O
 BlitzProg: I have very low hopes at this point, but I'm not giving up until I'm absolutely sure I have tried everything
 actualCoderTrevor: lol I considered that
 eulerscheZahl: but you are a MS guy
 eulerscheZahl: no azure?
 VincentBab: Stop improving your magic numbers guys, let me have that tshirt please :P
 struct: I never used any of them
 eulerscheZahl: never
 struct: I just picked one randomly
 CouscousAgha: I just noticed im the 10th c# player
 ddreams: how much did it cost you?
 CouscousAgha: do i get anything for that?
 BlitzProg: If this heuristic bot doesn't get me back top 200 gold, then I know nothing else was possible for me
 struct: the aws machine im using is using windows server so
 struct: ddreams no idea lol
 struct: pricing calculator was saying 0.5$ an hour
 Numby: is it possible to play in IDE vs someone from different league?
 Numby: like to test your gold bot vs the legends
 BlitzProg: legend can test vs gold, but not the other way around
 Westicles: CouscousAgha, you get +50 xp
 AllYourTrees: who do you want to play against Numby?
 ddreams: ok, so a cheap one
 CouscousAgha: Numby you can only test vs top 1000 of your league /and league below u if there are less than 1000 in your league
 struct: its 16 threads
 ddreams: well, $12 per day
 struct: yeah
 Numby: I
 struct: But I rented i only used it today
 Numby: I'd test vs reCurse
 struct: on last hours
 Numby: :D
 CouscousAgha: u want a test vs recurse?
 actualCoderTrevor: Numby I've heard you can do it with cgbench but can't confirm
 BlitzProg: recurse has like 95% win rate against at least every other players in the entire contest
 BlitzProg: it's pretty amazing
 <b>**Queuebee just now realised that swapping players swap them in the game and this game is skewed</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> actualCoderTrevor: Oh wait you said in the IDE
 AllYourTrees: Numby you don't appear when i search you for some reason :thinking:
 Numby: Hm weird my latest submit is scored at 1260
 Numby: gold
 CouscousAgha: he must be rank 800+ in gold
 CouscousAgha: yeah
 CouscousAgha: only top 1000 people are shown for us
 CouscousAgha: Westicles good enough for me
 nam4.nguyen: Hi
 nam4.nguyen: First time for this kind of contest. and I got top 500 but I feel I was so lucky to reach that
 struct: grats
 AllYourTrees: gz!
 nam4.nguyen: Thank you but I wonder about my bot
 Counterbalance: nooooo.. 0.18 pts under boss
 struct: counter just wait
 struct: you will get pushed
 struct: I hope
 Counterbalance: me too&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: i'm out of params to tweak
 struct: the machine run 300k tweaking params
 struct: didnt change anything
 struct: ...
 nam4.nguyen: I didn't know anything you guys talk about like brutal-tester or beam search etc
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance ebicochineal will push you&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: yeak i'm watching it&#160;:)
 struct: brutal tester is a tool to run games localy vs versions of your other bots
 struct: beam search is an algorithm
 ZarthaxX: oh no
 Counterbalance: oh no
 ZarthaxX: he beated you
 ZarthaxX: D:
 ZarthaxX: ah you will prob get there
 ZarthaxX: 2 guys submitting
 ZarthaxX: you got a win!
 Counterbalance: down to 4 now&#160;:(
 Counterbalance: fingers crossed..
 nam4.nguyen: Do you have any docs or something for newbies like me
 ZarthaxX: damn&#160;;(
 Counterbalance: i'll just resubmit when he's promoted :D
 ddreams: nam, you can find cg-brutaltester on github
 ddreams: it's a bit of work to set up
 nam4.nguyen: Thank you I will try it in next contest
 nam4.nguyen: I'm familiar with CP but it's way more diff to this contest
 Queuebee: Good night everyone. Good luck!
 ddreams: gn queenbee
 nam4.nguyen: no best solution, just optimal and try&#160;:((
 Lysk: just removed opponent sim and boom ranks goes up
 Kellthazar: Where I can get the referee jar for the spring2021? I tried to build from source code but didnt work
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 Lysk: or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 Lysk: zeno built it though
 Kellthazar: Oh, thank you folks
 JohnCM: how long do i need to wait to be able to play again if i have an error message
 JohnCM: i think i did self-test for too many times
 struct: i hate when first matches are 100% winrate
 struct: then my dreams get shatered 16 battles after
 JohnCM: i'm achieving 80% win rate now in gold
 JohnCM: but still cannot beat the boss
 ddreams: re_curse resubmitted
 Kellthazar: brutaltester worked... nice!
 Kellthazar: Released the Kraken
 Chainman: :sweat_smile:
 struct: im getting tired&#160;:(
 Chainman: same only few hours left
 struct: what time is it there?
 Chainman: usa it is 9:46PM in Central Time Zone
 struct: damn 03:47 am here&#160;:(
 Chainman: rough, I know I'm about to lose mental ability soon. 
 Chainman: It exponentially decreases at a time. 
 BlitzProg: 4:48am here
 Counterbalance: hmm
 Counterbalance: i thought my clock was off but it was just silent for 7 minutes&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :boom:
 eulerscheZahl: better?
 Counterbalance: :bird:
 ddreams: the toad is gone
 struct: I think im going to rewrite eval
 eulerscheZahl: now?
 Wontonimo: 5 hours, that's most of a business day
 ddreams: it's painful to recalibrate it
 ddreams: but yeah, I'm doing it too
 struct: euler I have no ideas
 struct:&#160;:(
 struct: also 5 hours is plenty of time
 struct: my current eval is not great
 JohnCM: i accidentally shrunk my code in the ide, anyone knows how to expand it
 ddreams: ctrl-scrollwheel
 eulerscheZahl: the &gt; and v on the left, next to the lines
 eulerscheZahl: uncollapse it
 Chainman: the touchpad by moving fingers away from each other.
 ddreams: I thought he meant zooming
 JohnCM: which ones?
 JohnCM: yea i zoomed mine to tiny font
 JohnCM: i want to unzoom it
 ddreams: ctrl-scrollwheel
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+p, type zoom
 ddreams: over the text
 Chainman: try alt+f4?
 ddreams: kick
 ddreams: :p
 Wontonimo: command + scroll wheel if you are on mac
 Chainman: :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: delete your cookies and reopen the site
 JohnCM: ah ok euler's method works
 JohnCM: i zoomed in to a decent size
 Counterbalance: control-+
 JohnCM: for a while i count see 100 lines at once
 JohnCM: could*
 ddreams: well, so far my new eval has a 3.13% win rate
 Chainman: I think that's different control +
 ddreams: I zoom it tiny on purpose, since I copy/paste it from my own editor
 JohnCM: yea i use mac, but i don't have a mouse
 Chainman: that's the entire webpage
 JohnCM: i think it was probably cmd + mouse movement that caused it, though i couldn't replicate
 Wontonimo: command + 2 finger swipe up or down
 ddreams: 2 finger swipe == scrollwheel
 Counterbalance: move closer to the screen, or further away
 Wontonimo: ^^
 Chainman: hmmm
 JohnCM: oh gosh finally won gold boss<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557333095">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/557333095</a>
 eulerscheZahl: buy a bigger screen
 ddreams: gz
 ddreams: now get above him
 ddreams: *it
 JohnCM: haha but the league is really hard to win
 Wontonimo: well, the last 8 hours have not been kind to me for coding, so no more submits for me
 JohnCM: ok i've got this, around 70% wins of the gold boss after mass tweaking of heuristics
 struct: ill only submit if I get a 65%+ version
 Wontonimo: first official contest, and i have to say i enjoyed it
 JohnCM: oh won my first 12 arena games, let's see where this goes
 BrunoFelthes: welcome Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: seeing everyone online at once has been great
 JohnCM: hi Wontonimo, thanks for your tips
 xoarianuh: I am struggling with this Ghost in the Cell game. What am I supposed to do to produce new cyborgs? 
 Wontonimo: hey JohnCM , no prob!  Did they work?
 eulerscheZahl: for his finger tips? are you the Mafia?
 JohnCM: the seeding technique works.i also added in my own move order arrangement tactic to prioritize low cost moves first
 JohnCM: save more sun points to react to opponent's growing of trees
 Wontonimo: wow!  look at you go!
 cegprakash: JohnCM what seeding technique
 JohnCM: oh doing good in league, won first 17 games
 JohnCM: haha Wontonimo, you ok if i share the seeding technique?
 eulerscheZahl: low cost first? shouldnt it be high cost?
 Wontonimo: go for it
 Chainman: oh
 eulerscheZahl: grow from 2 to 3, then you have less of size 2
 eulerscheZahl: so 1=&gt; 2 will get cheaper
 JohnCM: yea so basically knights move awayand you should seed 1 seed each move as it is 0 cost.grow the seed each round so the seeding move will be 0 cost
 ZarthaxX: i think all the people do that
 ZarthaxX: :P
 JohnCM: yes euler, the growing of seeds to trees are prioritized first
 eulerscheZahl: no ZarthaxX, that's pro tactics
 JohnCM: but i'm saying i like do actions like harvest, seeding
 Chainman: lol
 JohnCM: before grow
 kovi: morning
 struct: I dont do that
 JohnCM: so like grow is last action to take each round
 Chainman: I've been saying that this all today 
 BrunoFelthes: wow, morning kovi
 struct: hi kov i
 Chainman: hello
 BrunoFelthes: but i think that people here do not sleep yet :P
 AlexiusCzar: how to go back to problem after submtng solution??
 struct: I wont sleep until its over
 Wontonimo: it's over for me
 ddreams: I'm resubmitting my 11 hour old code...
 BrunoFelthes: will you not work tomorrow struct?
 eulerscheZahl: today*
 struct: no, im a student
 BrunoFelthes: Oh, nice
 ddreams: at least I will beat Ille :p
 eulerscheZahl: 4:10 am for him
 nam4.nguyen: I'm struggling at rank 300 gold league, you guys have any suggestions? And I wonder when I should haverst trees
 JohnCM: my tree harvesting action is tiered based on nutrients remaining
 ddreams: you have to post an interesting replay, nam
 JohnCM: so if i see opp past a threshold nutrient, i harvest mine too
 Wontonimo: hey nam4.nguyen , i'll take a look at your replays ... give me a sec
 BrunoFelthes: I was considering take vacations... Im too addicted to work and play..
 JohnCM: ohoh rank 30 gold league
 eulerscheZahl: i did that BrunoFelthes
 JohnCM: haha though i doubt i can win boss, my code doesn't win all the time
 eulerscheZahl: and then mostly prorastinated
 nam4.nguyen: Thank you guys
 ddreams: there euler, I pushed you a bit
 BrunoFelthes: ahuahhu, here in Brazil we can have 1 week vacation... but my wife didnt like the idea :P
 Chainman: oooh finally I lose to gold boss again, 
 Chainman: wow
 JohnCM: you mean you were winning?
 BrunoFelthes: did you liked this game eulerscheZahl?
 Chainman: nope, but still losing
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557337518">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557337518</a>
 Chainman: I feel I'm using sun points quite efficiently now.
 nam4.nguyen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557332292">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557332292</a>
 nam4.nguyen: I'm losing boss almost the time
 eulerscheZahl: board games are never my favorite
 eulerscheZahl: it's hard for me as a human to understand what's going on
 ddreams: you may consider to only have one seed on the board, nam
 JohnCM: i think i'm just gonna sit this one and see where my bot pushes me to. it is around top 30 gold now
 eulerscheZahl: so it mostly feels like throwing CPU at it and testing random things to see if it's any better
 Wontonimo: hey nam4.nguyen i can't see anything glaring
 JohnCM: perfect info board games can use monte carlo tree search
 struct: exactly what hapened to me on this contest euler
 ZarthaxX: same
 Wontonimo: nam4.nguyen i did see in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557336843">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557336843</a> that you finished a few s3 trees too soon and by frame 81 your production is a bit low
 struct: even during testing
 Chainman: I need one more push
 Chainman: seems your bot beats mine nam4.
 ddreams: I don't think that looks too low at 81, wonto
 eulerscheZahl: JohnCM yes, but the state explosion is enormous. that makes it hard for MCTS
 BrunoFelthes: but eulerscheZahl, do you prefer games with physics, like meanmax?
 JohnCM: what method did you use euler
 JohnCM: i mean if you're ok to share
 eulerscheZahl: i like grid games like pacman
 JohnCM: oh yes i like pacman
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like fog of war
 JohnCM: rank 23 now:) wonder if this push can make it
 Wontonimo: ddreams - you are correct ... lots of S2 trees
 BlitzProg: Ah, that feel of resignation, telling me it's finally time to give up
 eulerscheZahl: what's the boss score?
 BrunoFelthes: i like games with physics, but i think that the lasts with physics do not had too much success...
 BlitzProg: I'll try to push some of my old PHP AIs to see which are best, then I'm off
 Chainman: 81 moves in the game. 
 JustAProgrammer01234: some cool song I discovered<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 Chainman: Is it best to complete s3 trees when you have 3 or 4 of them on board?
 JohnCM: for me, never have more than 4 big trees
 JohnCM: cause it will increase the cost of lvl 3 grow too much
 Chainman: okay same
 JustAProgrammer01234: did anyone check out the cool song I discovered
 eulerscheZahl: no
 JustAProgrammer01234: ok then
 JustAProgrammer01234: here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 ddreams: no, stop spamming tho
 JustAProgrammer01234: Im not even spammin
 JustAProgrammer01234: bruh
 ddreams: also rick rolling is incredibly old by now
 ddreams: so try to make it fresh
 JustAProgrammer01234: nah
 JustAProgrammer01234: still funny
 JustAProgrammer01234: you clicked the link didn't you
 BlitzProg: ends with XcQ
 BlitzProg: ends with me not clicking on it
 JustAProgrammer01234:&#160;:(
 JustAProgrammer01234: ):
 JustAProgrammer01234: way better
 ClockSort: every internet veteran knows dQw4w9WgXcQ
 eulerscheZahl: i just know that i shouldn't click when it's praised as music
 JohnCM: well to be fair it's a nice song
 ClockSort: i know lol, i always listen :D
 KnightMoves: spent the last few hours watching reCurse replays and tweaking my eval function. Finally made it to legend
 ddreams: yeah, 99% of the time when someone posts actual music they like it's not something I like anyway
 ClockSort: i had to revert back 8 hours of dev time. I was making my bot worse :P
 ddreams: really just a waste of time
 eulerscheZahl: 100% for me. i don't like musics
 ClockSort: ddreams I know a song you would like but i won't post it
 ddreams: thanks&#160;:)
 codingWhale: Nice, KnightMoves! But why did you leave me behind? :expressionless:
 ClockSort: i even fixed bugs and that made my bot worse too
 eulerscheZahl: i'm the kind of person who skips a 30s movie scene because it's just playing music
 ddreams: same clocksort
 ddreams: I reverted 11 hours
 ddreams: at least that bot got into top100
 ZarthaxX: ClockSort first time legend?
 ClockSort: my mcts uses a buggy UCT function because that works better than tracking visits properly, haha
 ZarthaxX: o.o
 ClockSort: @ZarthaxX yes and rank 21! I'm stoked
 ddreams: how is it buggy?
 ZarthaxX: dude you smashed it gz!
 KnightMoves: codingWhale you're so close!
 ddreams: maybe you've innovated
 ClockSort: it uses global visit count on every node
 ZarthaxX: potential t shirt
 JohnCM: clocksort your monte carlo is working very well
 ClockSort: tracking node visits is extra computation because i store visits on the edges
 Wontonimo: global visits?
 Wontonimo: instead of parent?
 JohnCM: how do you store your mcts search between turns though
 JohnCM: is there global memory
 ClockSort: yes, the visits of the root node every time :sweat_smile:
 codingWhale: I'll just go to bed and hope someone pushes me over.&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: cheers to you for making that work!
 eulerscheZahl: ok, good morning codingWhale
 JohnCM: i can't test with my ide anymore, so i'm just testing with arena now
 codingWhale: yeah, good night
 ClockSort: i don't think i'll make any changes in these last 4 hours
 ClockSort: i don't know how to improve
 JohnCM: haha clocksort you did well this competition alr
 ClockSort: i guess optimising mcts for speed would help
 JohnCM: but is there global memory where you can store variables between turns?
 ddreams: you don't even use bitboards, right?
 Wontonimo: how many simulations are you doing per 100ms ClockSort?
 ZarthaxX: bitboarding :D
 ClockSort: yes. static State STATES[800000];
 JohnCM: i guess any variable outside of the while loop for the game is a global variable?
 ClockSort: @wontonimo 12000 rollouts on avg from opening, but on later turns i reuse the tree if possible
 Wontonimo: sigh, i'm at 3000 ... too many performance issues
 ClockSort: @ddreams that's right, it's an array of 37 ints. horrible :laughing:
 JohnCM: yea you probably also prune quite a lot of moves that don't make sense, like one space seeding
 Wontonimo: and i've run out of car
 Wontonimo: care
 eulerscheZahl: others run out of gas
 Wontonimo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: but not Wontonimo. he runs out of cars
 Wontonimo: either I'm balling, or a car thief
 JohnCM: codingwhale almost there for legend
 eulerscheZahl: whale is gone
 Counterbalance: it's blinking
 MADDY-1: hii guys
 ZarthaxX: annoying blink
 Chainman: I can't think anymore, will need to take a nap soon.
 Chainman: I think I've been making my bot worse.
 ddreams: yeah, I'm off too
 ddreams: I'm ok with top 100 this time :p
 Chainman: nice,
 BrunoFelthes: hope that someone explain how to deal with bitboards at this contest, my bitboard was worsts than the regular class...
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: :P
 eulerscheZahl: struct has a nice representation
 BrunoFelthes: he exposed it?
 Chainman: struct has shared?
 Chainman: nani?
 eulerscheZahl: i just know that he can do the shadow without unsetting bits
 struct: o.o
 Chainman: hmmmmmm
 eulerscheZahl: will you write about it after the contest?
 BrunoFelthes: struct, please share it :D
 struct: I can sure
 ddreams: why would you unset bits for shadow?
 ZarthaxX: best bitboard representation ever
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 ClockSort: struct is da man
 ZarthaxX: he meant filter somebits in the process ddreams
 Chainman: is bitboarding just a mask for where your trees and opponent are?  Also I use mask for dormant trees.
 eulerscheZahl: not to wrap around. leaving the map on one side and going back in on the other side
 struct: BrunoFelthes ill share it after contest ends
 ZarthaxX: because calculating shadows requires shifts and depending on your representation wraparound is a problem
 ClockSort: you can use a mask to find shadows without a loop
 BrunoFelthes: sure
 ClockSort: i haven't figured out how though :D
 ddreams: hmm.. you can do the 3-shadow without once filtering, struct?
 struct: yes
 cegprakash: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 BrunoFelthes: oh, i can see now... , one mask for each position
 ZarthaxX: position?
 ddreams: hmm.. maybe I'm filtering for no reason
 ZarthaxX: size of trees
 Counterbalance: shadows[angle][size] &amp; 1ULL&lt;&lt;cellidx&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 1-hot encoding for the trees
 struct: I dont use masks
 struct: I use shifts
 struct: to get seeds I do use masks
 struct: but thats about it
 eulerscheZahl: just that you use your own cell index and not the one given by the referee
 Chainman: that's it I'm out, I still can't beat gold boss&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: Chainman gg
 ddreams: yeah, I shift too, but I filter once against the bitmask you call "inside"
 ddreams: perhaps it's unecessary

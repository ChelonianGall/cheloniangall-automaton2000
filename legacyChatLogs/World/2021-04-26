 Alex-1: mingtrau that too much you again say something about me
 Lachrymosa: I have some questions about the Dwarfs Standing on the shoulders of Giants puzzle, specifically my thought-process. I want to know if what I'm thinking of doing is excessive computation or par
 BigFatDecker: haha i cant even find any answers on stack overflow
 BigFatDecker: i dont even know whats wrong i didnt even change any code from the download
 VizGhar: Lachrymosa - ask
 Alex-1: hii VizGhar
 VizGhar: yello Alex-1
 Alex-1: what was going
 Lachrymosa: So the question is asking to give the greatest length of successive nodes.  I was wondering if it makes sense to establish all the nodes and then just generate all chains and then take the longest?  Like there's gotta be a pruning technique or something right?
 VizGhar: hmm I'll have to se my solution
 VizGhar: I've made complete graph and then I was looking for solution using recursion. So you wont need much optimization
 BigFatDecker: ok so i went to JSON validater i get this error Error: Parse error on line 50252:...0amplification": 50 mants ": 50254, "	\
 VizGhar: there is maximum of 10.000 nodes based on Input description. It's not that much
 Lachrymosa: So as long as I'm not doing stuff like for looping a bunch of times through all the data it should finish in time
 VizGhar: Just don't do unnecessary stuff. I'm telling you, Im using recursion (root of all evil). So you can to
 VizGhar: *too
 VizGhar: (20 lines of code in kotlin)
 Lachrymosa: I know I'll need it for this, at least to walk my nodes. Recursion and node based mapping has been troublesome for me in the past but I think I can tackle it
 VizGhar: yup. I've made graph as
 BigFatDecker: oh my gosh it was all because i had an extra comma
 Lachrymosa: bet that caused quite the comma-otion
 BigFatDecker: haha very funny lol
 Lachrymosa: if I wanted to quickly access my nodes by their ID number without iterating over a list all the time, would it make sense to make a dictionary that has id as the key and the object as the data?
 Smelty: .
 Smelty: hi?
 riseofninja: ./
 riseofninja: \./
 Lachrymosa: `/\`
 VizGhar: Lachrymosa yes... Dictionary and Map are names for same thing I think
 Lachrymosa: I'm close, i'm having an off-by-one kind of problem
 Lachrymosa: its something in the way I'm counting in my recursion
 VizGhar: so you are not running out of time&#160;:) thats nice

 davilla: I haven't worked this problem yet, but there's something that stands out about your code
 davilla: you have a return statement inside of a for loop

 DeeAyDan: I'm a c# coder (beginner) and I'm stuck on Horse-racing Duals case 2 
 Alex-1: yeah DeeAyDan
 Alex-1: you solve decent
 DeeAyDan: what do you mean?
 Alex-1: decent puzzle easy
 DeeAyDan: you can see my code?
 KiwiTae: horse racing is easy too
 DeeAyDan: I got the first part down, but 2nd one not quite
 KiwiTae: how do you do it right now?
 DeeAyDan: sould I copy the code here?
 KiwiTae: yes~ or mp me

 jacek: you need to compare in all horses
 jacek: it wont solve i.e. 2 5 10 6
 jacek: or any unordered horses
 jacek: firstly you need to read all the input to some array or list
 DeeAyDan: so in my guess I need a new array to store the inputs and check from that
 jacek: :tada:
 DeeAyDan: :grin:
 KiwiTae: jacek hint maeister :D
 jacek: horse racing is kind of pony problem
 DeeAyDan: I found what's the problem. I tried to find the difference between the 2 strongest horses, not the 2 closest in strengths. :sweat_smile:
 DeeAyDan: And the first part worked becouse the 2 closest in strength were the 2 strongest ones.
 jacek: how about 3. test case
 KiwiTae: time out inc
 DeeAyDan: I didn't reach it yet, I'm writing the code for case 2 atm
 DeeAyDan: case 3 also works
 jacek: oO
 DeeAyDan: right after case 2

 Marchete: like wth?
 Illedan: :D
 Marchete: but is going as all my CG bot, as Astrobytes said
 Marchete: one stupid bug over another
 Illedan: I can hopefully start to train mine during this week
 Marchete: and your NN? or it's on hold?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: I just managed to use TF to train my Onboarding bot yesterday
 Marchete: nice
 Marchete: so you can export weights
 Illedan: And it worked 99.996&#160;% of the time&#160;:)
 Illedan: Yeah
 Marchete: noice
 Illedan: Submited as my C# code in Onboarding if you wanna see :P
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: you have some training code left
 Illedan: Yeah, that part is not finished
 Illedan: And I should throw it away
 Marchete: not needed with TF, no?
 Illedan: nono

 Marchete: yes
 Astrobytes: Also a little comment in Norwegian

 Astrobytes: btw, did you see on discord Julien is onboard with the idea of a time bank system in the SDK
 Illedan: Like on RAIC right?
 Astrobytes: I would presume something along those lines
 Marchete: I'd rather prefer some kind of space for NN weights
 struct: time bank would be nice in some games
 struct: I think ive asked about it before
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Marchete: that won't do the AI creation inherently better
 Marchete: I mean, it's ok, but if everyone have NNms each turn
 Marchete: I'm ok with that
 Illedan: How much can you package your weights Marchete?
 Marchete: I imagine I can package around 120KB of code+weights
 Marchete: I know others convert float32 to float16
 Marchete: or even int discretization
 Marchete: I don't thing I'll do it
 Marchete: think*
 Illedan: Hmm, not using the full 16 bit chars?

 Astrobytes: Sure
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Ok I wasn't sure if there was some other way I didn't know about
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: thanks
 Astrobytes: It's not as much work as it sounds, depending how much effort you put into it ofc
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yeah I assume if you are using some kind of simulation you can just reuse that code

 GIPOKE: how
 ChristianDowns: not sure if that can be done in this
 ChristianDowns: what language
 GIPOKE: javascript
 Marchete: ok, my bugfix for player2 moves just added 2 new bugs
 ChristianDowns: You'll probably have to do a post to a dictionary website
 Westicles: Make a DAWG

 GIPOKE: each time i get 39 words and i need to find out how many misspelled words and missing periods there are by outputting numbers
 struct: Just feed it to Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if u have to wait for the new inputs
 Therabidpanther: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: maybe it's not a multi
 GIPOKE: im just joining a diff one

 Astrobytes: what was the previous one called
 GIPOKE: it was some spelling one
 GIPOKE: WHAT someone finished with 75%
 Astrobytes: you remember the name or anything?

 GIPOKE: yes
 Astrobytes: You know this is easy af right
 GIPOKE: no of course not
 Astrobytes: Output descriptionTwo space separated numbers, first the number of misspelled words (words that differ from the problem statement), secondly the number of missing periods.
 Astrobytes: StatementI am not a good speller. Sometimes I mix up the spelling of words and sometimes I even forget to put periods. Please count the number of words I have misspelled and the number of periods I have missed.
 GIPOKE: hmm wait a minute
 GIPOKE: no not that im reading the comments on it
 GIPOKE: there is one perfect sentence on here
 GIPOKE: so i need to find how many words/periods differ from the perfect sentence
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Like I said, it's really easy
 GIPOKE: i didnt notice there was a perfect sentence
 struct: on reverse can be a bit confusing

 Lathryx: Learning how to build AIs through the "Coders Strike Back" thing! Can anyone tell me how the `nextCheckpointDist` is calculated? 
 KiwiTae: distance(A,B) = |AB|
 jacek: no need to calculate distance, it is provided to you
 Smelty: :0
 VizGhar: Or you can get to idk gold league? and compute it from advanced inputs
 Smelty: pythagorean theorem bois
 KiwiTae: if its the norm2 ah
 Lathryx: Thanks! :slight_smile:
 Lathryx: Is there a learning center somewhere that will teach me how to use the given inputs effectively? 
 Lathryx: Cause I feel like I'm missing something... 
 ZuhairAbid: anyone wants to play escape?

 VizGhar: well parse input and find the one, that is closest to 0 (absolute value)
 VizGhar: Or better find the closest to 0, so that you can pick positive number if necessary
 Saf1997: Is the abs() method necessary for the "finding number closest to zero"&#160;?

 booalgo: what it do&#160;?
 booalgo: *does 
 Illedan: "0.123,1.52,-1.235" converted to numbers and added to an array
 booalgo: s=input().split(',') i think something like this
 Illedan: Yeah, that is fine. but the mapping syntax afterwards.
 booalgo: oh

 Zenoscave: Illedan map(float,var_with_nums.split(',')) would work too. map is slightly faster than list comprehensions (booalgo's version) but usually harder to read
 Zenoscave: py3 has map struct
 struct: So I was right
 struct: :D
 struct: I even optimize by mistake now
 Santjl: my friends
 Santjl: can someone make a code to transform from decimal to simplified fraction?
 Zenoscave: is it for a clash?
 Zenoscave: struct lol "optimize by mistake"
 Santjl: was from the clash, but I didn't get it and I'm curious
 Zenoscave: what lang you want
 Santjl: js
 pardouin: decimal -&gt; number / power of 10
 pardouin: and then you divide both parts by the gcd
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 set note to self: stop reading politics of any kind @_@
 Automaton2000: is there a way to move
 Santjl: the point is that the number of decimal places varies
 pardouin: ex: 3.007 -&gt; 3007 / 10^3
 Santjl: i know this
 pardouin: so what's the pb&#160;?
 Santjl: but and when the number comes 45467.859
 Zenoscave: I think he's missing the gcd
 pardouin: 45467859 / 10^3
 Santjl: omg
 AntiSquid: wtf
 Santjl: I'm very dumb
 AntiSquid: bbq
 AntiSquid: cnn
 AntiSquid: bbc
 Zenoscave: anti what are you on about
 AntiSquid: helping with the acronyms, sorry
 pardouin: bbc&#160;? D:
 Zenoscave: pardouin wanna share your ruby power of thor with me :D

 pardouin: oh, I must have a perverted mind
 Zenoscave: just a bit&#160;;)
 pardouin: &lt;- ruby beginner
 AntiSquid: why? what else does it mean? ok i'll google
 pardouin: I spent lot of time reading the whole documentation tho
 Zenoscave: ruby-beginner holds 1st place
 Zenoscave: any hints for the golf?
 pardouin: but I never code in ruby so I never use it in CoC for example
 pardouin: caus I would run out of time ^^
 Zenoscave: Yeah I'm focusing on the golf
 Zenoscave: I use ruby a lot. but golf always escapes me
 pardouin: it's basically perl with more features
 pardouin: and more verbose for regex
 struct: Sometimes is usefull to run bash there too
 Zenoscave: true. are you just regex'ing?
 Zenoscave: with the backticks struct?
 pardouin: depends on the pb
 pardouin: CN -&gt; full regex
 struct: yes
 Smelty: yes
 Zenoscave: yeah I sed most of CN
 jacek: CN?
 AntiSquid: BBC is also used for british born chinese btw

 Zenoscave: yup hi
 Zenoscave: I forgot why
 Astrobytes: FFS :D
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 jacek: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: maybe zeno wanted to talk to your cat too
 Illedan: From Oware:If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game.
 Illedan: How often does this occur?
 AntiSquid: rarely but i've seen it happen at least once or twice
 AntiSquid: and it's tricky too to do since you are not supposed to leave opponent without moves
 Marchete: often enough
 Marchete: oware rules are cancer
 AntiSquid: yes
 Illedan: Yeah, need to sim the whole move to validate it -.--
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: read the referee
 Marchete: the thing is that you need to evaluate moves
 Illedan: oh, nvm. That is just some math
 Marchete: and then know if you are at endgame or not
 Illedan: Where is the link?

 Astrobytes: I don't think it's different
 Astrobytes: did you talk with darkhorse about amazons change struct? 
 Astrobytes: I saw he was on earlier
 jacek: the darkhorse64&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Are there others? :o
 struct: is he still on?
 Astrobytes: I think so
 darkhorse64: Hii
 jacek: lets invite him to clash
 darkhorse64: noo
 Astrobytes: lol "Hii"
 darkhorse64: could not resist
 struct: darkhorse64 is your github from clobber updated?
 struct: I dont see where you change the moves
 darkhorse64: It's up to date, except for the boss code
 darkhorse64: Let me see
 AntiSquid: :thinking: that hii triggered the ban hammer 
 struct: ok, Im afk for 5 mins
 Tadatadatadam: laser on  my eyes) bzzzzzz
 karimk123: sup bois
 karimk123: im spooderman
 karimk123: say hi
 Astrobytes: You're not. Get a grip.
 Illedan: Hmm, sim doesn't check if my action cleans all enemy houses?
 Illedan: (Oware)
 karimk123: bruh
 karimk123: what did u just say to spooderman&gt;?
 jacek: huh
 Astrobytes: It does iirc
 Illedan: Where? :P
 Illedan: oh
 Illedan: wait
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 kick spooderman's precious
 Automaton2000: i wanna make a nn
 Illedan: Thought we got valid moves as input here
 jacek: Automaton2000 wheres AutomatonNN
 Automaton2000: you have to take into account the fact that a lot of money
 Illedan: Wierdly written code this thing
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a little peculiar
 Marchete: enjoy the rules
 jacek: thats some code from cg staff
 Marchete: I mean, it's the game rules
 Marchete: not only how's coded
 jacek: game is easy
 AntiSquid: ok now tell him to skill up and that the bugs are his fault
 struct: back
 Astrobytes: wb
 AntiSquid: welcome back
 struct: tyty
 AntiSquid: you broke the awkward silence @_@ good good
 jacek: okaeri
 jacek: or okairi? hmm
 struct: I dont know what you are saying sorry
 darkhorse64: struct: if I remember well, there are two tiny changes needed, one in Viewer.java (around line 50-60, look at xG,yG code), the other in Referee.java line 142
 AntiSquid: dunno, what are you trying to say?
 jacek: 'welcome home'
 jacek: in weeb lang
 Astrobytes: No one speaks weeb here
 AntiSquid: Okaerinasai (お帰りなさい), or “okaeri” for short, is used to welcome someone else home, usually after they say “tadaima”.
 struct: ty darkhorse64 ill check
 AntiSquid: woah, again the non-weeb supremacists are trying to put us down, jacek
 darkhorse64: try a diff with your amazons code
 AntiSquid: we need to take to the streets

 jacek: i just now random words/phrases from anime
 jacek: know even
 AntiSquid: only from anime? you need to step it up
 AntiSquid: while you're still in the flower of youth
 SimpleNick: wakarimakari japan)
 darkhorse64: i don't think so but let me check once again
 struct: I also changed how I send board
 struct: to reverse it
 struct: like you did
 SimpleNick: if you go to schol language for jap it easy
 AntiSquid: i went to London today (for some paperwork stuff, not disclosing) but with this occasion i also went to have some katsu pork sandwich, i know it's not 100% jap tradition, but it was good, i accidentally passed by that cafe (honestly)
 darkhorse64: The trick is that moves are generated from squares names and the code look for the squares that match the inputs. Naming properly squares is all you need
 SimpleNick: understanding ierogliphic system jap help understand img language
 struct: ok I think it works
 struct: At least I made Astroboss work
 struct: by changing 1 line in output
 struct: Thanks for the help darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: You are subcontracting boss work :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: I offered :D
 darkhorse64: My pleasure
 AntiSquid: what's this boss work business all about?
 struct: he made boss for amazons
 struct: Im lazy
 Astrobytes: *busy
 darkhorse64: With a proper code base, implementing a board game is not a lot of work. Designing a boss is more difficult
 AntiSquid: *planning to build back better
 struct: maybe simplify it and replace the tiles with two colors:⚫ BLACK - disabled⚪ WHITE - available
 struct: What does this mean?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: mines just a hacked together highly disabled alphabeta mess
 Astrobytes: Just to beat/draw with random
 darkhorse64: You mean you got inspired with my code&#160;? :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: nine men morris gone from contribs, wonder what happened
 Astrobytes: lol 
 struct: AntiSquid I heard its going to be the next contest, thats why it got removed
 Astrobytes: Mine does deepen iteratively though iirc :D
 jacek: and whats the eval
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/ struct
 jacek: so i could beat it
 AntiSquid: quite sure that would be a lame contest
 Astrobytes: You'll beat it jacek
 AntiSquid: 100% sure it's solvable or solved
 struct: its solved yes
 darkhorse64: nine men morris is solved I think
 jacek: but try to solve it in 50ms
 Astrobytes: Yes, not sure if so under cg constraints? There are other morris versions too
 AntiSquid: hard code it .
 struct: Maybe next contest is chess with all the hype around it
 darkhorse64: jacek does not need an eval, only n-tuple patterns
 AntiSquid: it's some gardening flower puff nature hippy stuff for sure
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: and I add more bugs each time
 Marchete: damn
 AntiSquid: or maybe it really is "Made in Abyss" inspired
 Astrobytes: Marchete: just don't lose your last best good version&#160;;)
 Marchete: it's too late
 Astrobytes: Ahhh dude
 Marchete: nah, it must be on submits
 darkhorse64: now, it's don't lose your last brain

 Aniboy: Hi
 karimk123: hi

 jacek: what about the demo
 AntiSquid: hi new to codinGame
 struct: you are right jacek
 struct: as always

 Aniboy: I was trying my hands-on Defibrillators puzzle, were can I review my code or ask for help
 Aniboy: I am near to  solution
 jacek: you can try the forum, chat here, or discord's general
 Astrobytes: Check the forum thread Aniboy? Forum link on left of the IDE
 Aniboy: thanks guys I'll try forum first&#160;:)
 struct: Should i move it to ready?
 Astrobytes: Outline any changes in a comment
 darkhorse64: Maybe you should wait for the contest end for that. 
 Astrobytes: Not gonna affect the user uptake tbh
 struct: I need all the advantage I can get
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I thought I changed how board is sent
 Astrobytes: but...
 struct: On clobber board is read from top to bottom 
 struct: or bottom to top?
 struct: top being 8
 struct: ok is top to bottom
 struct: ill change statement only
 struct: .......
 darkhorse64: top to bottom, the idea is that if you print row after row, you see the board state
 IronPostItNote_6196: oh ok thank
 struct: Done, I had to make source private due to boss code
 struct: Also I changed board to 16x16 so it fits on m256 register
 Astrobytes: lol
 darkhorse64: how many moves at start&#160;?
 struct: I can check it
 Astrobytes: Can't even download my own boss :P&#160;;)
 struct: ((char) (8 - getY(idx)) + '0');

 struct: I think othello also has it
 IronPostItNote_6196: do you guys hear me&#160;?

 struct: Is to make sure people read the statement
 Astrobytes: Heh heh heh
 Astrobytes: Good strategy I guess
 IronPostItNote_6196: hehe what
 darkhorse64: 8666 moves; it's not a tree search, it's a needle in a haystack

 WesCraterMadman: lol thanks
 Butanium: lol ok smelty
 WesCraterMadman: I'd feel better about it if it weren't such a dumb issue
 Butanium: I'll go to sleep
 Smelty: g n
 WesCraterMadman: gn
 Smelty: even though its afternoon for me
 Butanium: lol thanks
 Astrobytes: WesCraterMadman: We are ALL prone to such things at times
 Astrobytes: Really darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64: I expand all nodes at a time
 Astrobytes: Try pruning the moves
 Smelty: byte pair encoding..
 darkhorse64: I can try but I fear I will play poorly at the beginning. Yep, pruning for the win but it requires more effort than just bitboarding an engine
 Astrobytes: Boss doesn't bitboard
 Astrobytes: Just forward prunes savagely, uses half the time on turns &gt; 1 and has a crap eval :P
 struct: Even on first turn is quite a large ammount of moves
 Astrobytes: from the boss or the game?
 struct: The game
 struct: for mcts
 struct: if you dont prune
 Astrobytes: Yes. The movecount is ridiculous for some games
 Astrobytes: *some starting positions
 Astrobytes: Very cool
 struct: I cant be sure that the random positions are balanced
 struct: but at least both players get it
 Astrobytes: It seems to work well
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm tired as hell. I'll see you all tomorrow
 Astrobytes: gn all
 struct: gn
 SimpleNick: a small question can anyone come across, I want to have a memory profiler, where to start this topic
 zarkos: how do i report a cheater in code battle
 orangesnowfox: Why do you think whoever it is is cheating?
 zarkos: bro his code almost look like binary lol
 orangesnowfox: lol?
 SimpleNick: binary tree search)
 Salted: Cheating on here? Ha! Well did you know the character counter only counts ascii and not unicode.  So the script limit doesn't exist if you know that. 
 Salted: So you can make insanely large neural networks and win competitions that way. Not that it's cheating....
 Smelty:&#160;:( I haven't gotten a good code for byte pair encoding
 Notter: How do I still get timeouts in puzzles without time limits?
 Smelty: idk
 Smelty: process timed out?
 Smelty: p.s. how do I indent an entire section of code
 SimpleNick: opencv maybe
 SimpleNick: i dont know 100%
 Smelty: o
 struct: puzzles have time limit

 Smelty: send help java
 Smelty: also i just realized the value of best1 doesnt get updated, but idk why
 SimpleNick: it simple algorihm sub string
 Smelty: e
 SimpleNick: cycle (){
 Smelty: also i think i got it
 Smelty: w-
 Smelty: *visible confusion*
 SimpleNick: pick 1 element array and equal he in string and pick if search ++
 Smelty: true
 SimpleNick: and 3 array for frequency
 Smelty: also i fixed it, i was comparing two strings with ==, not equals()
 SimpleNick: but i dont know this alghoritm a pro level i know simple
 Smelty: well. next step, convert each symbol of that type into different symbol and save it
 Smelty: *sighs*
 SimpleNick: may be ye i see - 3 array and end of program simple out 3 array for paste diagram or numbers
 Smelty: got the code working for 1, but fails at multiple....
 Smelty: debug mode: *on*
 SimpleNick:  nice start
 WesCraterMadman: yo
 WesCraterMadman: does anyone know a good starting point to learn about simulation?
 Smelty: hmm
 WesCraterMadman: If it affects your answer, I'm currently working on cvz
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/1939/basic-simulation-and-evaluation/welcome">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/1939/basic-simulation-and-evaluation/welcome</a>
 Smelty: idk
 WesCraterMadman: ooh thanks
 Smelty: i just searched up "simulation" in the hotbar for codingame XD
 WesCraterMadman: lol
 Smelty: whats wrong with my byte pair encoding ai? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/AEPKWd.jpg">https://snipboard.io/AEPKWd.jpg</a>
 Smelty: that is the string at each stage
 WesCraterMadman: what are you working on?
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/byte-pair-encoding">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/byte-pair-encoding</a>
 Smelty: weekly puzzle...
 Smelty: it works for test 1 currently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u doing PY Smelty?
 Smelty: java
 SimpleNick: o mcts idont know ty
 Smelty: um weekly puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just looked at my php code, pretty easy really
 Smelty:&#160;:(
 Smelty: sad face
 PatrickMcGinnisII: are you replacing the highest frequency pairs with capital letters?
 SimpleNick: wwow ty realy you open my mind
 Bomaycatdaumoi: alo
 Smelty: yes i did
 Smelty: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you just keep doing that from Z to A until the frequency of a pair is only 1
 Smelty: i konw
 Smelty: i was doing that
 Smelty: but it fails
 Smelty: TwT
 SimpleNick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/1939/basic-simulation-and-evaluation/vectors">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/1939/basic-simulation-and-evaluation/vectors</a> 
 SimpleNick: it new chapter in my life
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Smelty i guess it depeends on if you are using Collections or not
 SimpleNick: i try this algorithm in realy simple works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: from collections import defaultdict
 Smelty: hm
 Smelty: here is my code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/V33NnKxc">https://pastebin.com/V33NnKxc</a>
 Smelty: mind if you look over it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ops sry that was from PY solution
 SimpleNick: i see you code i read
 Smelty: e
 Smelty: well i have to go in a second, so maybe late
 Smelty: perhaps message me with suggestions?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you are doubling the work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try k=j+1, then run it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for (int k=j+1;k&lt;m;k++)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, whatever
 SimpleNick: hm
 SimpleNick: we find 1 best
 SimpleNick: i think all string all chars on string
 SimpleNick: aaabbbccc 3a3b3c
 SimpleNick: mcts information on the night
 SimpleNick: wow
 SimpleNick: it algorithm
 SimpleNick: in my high school taught, I even remember with what passion the teacher taught him even though 10 years have passed
 SimpleNick: :grinning:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Back then you had to be careful not to overwrite the BIOS or DOS while doing DMA transfers for graphics and hooking interupt vectors
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall got it easy
 SimpleNick: i have book) from 2002 intro to c#)
 SimpleNick: :slight_smile:
 Monsiur_Minh: and???
 SimpleNick: and i remember use it 1 check
 Monsiur_Minh: :thumbsup:
 SimpleNick: and turn new semestr and starting C++
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl, I have a C book from the 80s...smh
 SimpleNick: yes old book it member
 SimpleNick: ]portal

 davilla: do not all of the past contests become bot programming challenges?
 davilla: maybe it just takes time
 davilla: missing Spring 2020 and Unleash the Geek
 davilla: from the end of 2019
 davilla: take that back, just missing the latter
 davilla: I guess Unleash didn't turn out to be a very good contest
 Alex-1: hi world

 Zorg1: yet another genious that will write high quality CoC puzzles&#160;?
 Or64bit: Hey guys
 Or64bit: Can I ask a quick c++ question?
 geppoz: no harm in try&#160;;)
 Or64bit: So this is only theory for now, but I'd like to make a class that collects other classes which can be uninitialized if the user needs them to be
 Or64bit: Basically I'd make a scene class that would collect other objects of classes that need to be in a gamescene at once
 Piokemon: hello
 BucurEva87: Where was the question in there, @Or64bit&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 404 not found
 Skynse: I wonder what language CodinGame's backend was written in
 Skynse: anyone know?
 Megha.Akash: Just use What runs chrome extension and buitwith extension and check it out @Skynse
 BucurEva87: I never tried that, but I highly doubt it works&#160;:))

 MartinEduardo: Hello guys how are you?
 artmyros: good
 artmyros: im good
 aamsii: merry christmas
 TyLuu: me ri chịt mợt nha mấy ba mấy má
 GamingWarrior: hi, I would like to join! (Also nice Chrismas eve)
 MSmits: hi guys
 struct: hi
 MSmits: finished solver in the middle of the night, looking for other options now
 MSmits: shared 2nd place basically, with jrke
 7amasa: hello guys
 7amasa: I am here to learn to be a software developer, what should I do now?
 MSmits: mmh not sure if thats exactly what we do here
 MSmits: we use algorithms to solve puzzles and play games
 MSmits: not the same as writing an app, designing a database or maintaining a website
 MSmits: you'll get faster at problem solving using code though
 7amasa: Then what do you suggest I do if I want to find a job as a software developer :D?
 ZarthaxX: pick a project, and you will learn while doing it
 ZarthaxX: later you have that it show off in interviews
 ZarthaxX: to*
 7amasa: thats cool thanks for the suggestion, where should I pick a project? 
 ZarthaxX: that's smth you have to come up with
 ZarthaxX: think of smth you would like to make
 7amasa: aw makes sense :D 
 7amasa: Alright will start with that right away, thanks again
 ZarthaxX: like a web app, or a desktop app
 ZarthaxX: etc
 ZarthaxX: you will start googling how to make your project and you will learn lots of stuff
 ZarthaxX: better than just learning X thing without a purpose
 7amasa: That makes perfect sense, thank you for your help bro
 ZarthaxX: np&#160;:)
 zhoubou: I'm doing the puzzle of the week (2048). I'm starting by evaluating how the board looks after a move (Up, down, left or right). How do I ensure I don't merge the same tile twice?
 MSmits: maybe check the referee?
 MSmits: see how it's coded
 MSmits: obviously the referee needs to check this as well
 MSmits: (I mean the github link)
 MSmits: usually i dont need to, the description is clear enough in most cases
 zhoubou: Where can I find this link?
 MSmits: in the description I guess? Thats where it is usually add
 MSmits: at
 MSmits: scroll through it
 zhoubou: Ahh, I see it. It's hidden in the text for "Expert rules". Thanks!
 MSmits: np 
 Gorter: Dumb question maybe, but why is there no factor for shortest in clash of code. Code size really depends on the programming language used...
 Jasperr: Why would there be
 Jasperr: Imagine winning shortest with 200 lines of Java vs 50 lines of Ruby
 Jasperr: Kinda weird right?
 Gorter: Yes and no
 Gorter: I think that data type definition should not be counted as characters at least. 
 zhoubou: I think it's unsolvable that way. Where do you stop with rules like that? Unless it was made so only people with the same programming language can join...
 zhoubou: Or if it was mandatory to choose a certain language
 Jasperr: I disagree (with the arbitrary ignore-rules), shortest is as much a challenge of solving the problem as it is of picking the right language and figuring out nifty language-specific tricks
 Gorter: Yea you are probably right. Wouldn't mind something like a ranked mode, where there are only 1 or few options. Which varies..
 Jasperr: A language-specific clash mode would be fun, but would also be pretty much impossible to fill with non-bots as everyone has their own preferred language
 Gorter: Depends on the language I think :P
 Jasperr: Haha true
 Gorter: Python would be popular
 Jasperr: Most people seem to use Python or JS in non-shortest and Ruby in shortest
 MSmits: people also use python in shortest because they just dont know ruby
 zhoubou: Anyone did 2048 puzzle recently? I'm having problems with it not "listening" to my output.
 jrke: i last saw you when you were going to sleep MS now i am going to sleep lol gn
 Astrobytes: gn jrke
 MSmits: hey
 MSmits: gn jrke
 jrke: b-bye
 jrke: btw before sleeping i wanna say that   yes MS you play first 50-55 moves good to win in D&amp;B
 struct: MSmits SupSon asked if you used bitboards on D&amp;B
 jrke: have to play *
 k4ng0u: zhoubou what's your problem exactly? I basically copy pasted (with small translation from java to c++) the referee and didn't not encounter major issues
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: yeah i do use bitboards on D&amp;B
 MSmits: but i convert them into a graph for the solver, so its only temporary
 struct: oh well, I told him you used them
 zhoubou: k4ng0u I'm sorry. My mistake. "Right" in my language starts with "D". That's where the confusion comes from.
 struct: and linked him chat log
 MSmits: well i do
 MSmits: two uint64_t, one for hor and one for vertical
 MSmits: then convert to a different system with boxes instead of lines
 MSmits: a single uint64_t for that. Thats for the graph
 Astrobytes: makes sense
 k4ng0u: zhoubou by language you mean your code right? not sure how the language can influence on what "starts" by what =&gt; it seems to be very implementation related
 zhoubou: My native natural language. English is not my native language.
 k4ng0u: oh ok ok I see
 zhoubou: Thanks for chiming in&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: desni/desno
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 zhoubou: Yes ^
 Astrobytes: just googled it&#160;:)
 Salted: Hello World!
 Astrobytes: hello
 MSmits: hi
 zhoubou: Astrobytes nice googling skills there
 Astrobytes: thanks, I was hoping I'd chosen the correct ones&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Haha :P
 TobiasA: in this defibrijksjdfjsjftor thing i done everything correctly but it keeps choosing the wrong one
 Mohamed_Kharrat: guys where do we find puzzle of the week&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048</a>
 eulerscheZahl: while the default code is enough to get 100%, that's not what you are supposed to do here
 eulerscheZahl: improve the algo to get a higher score, as this puzzle has a leaderboard
 Mohamed_Kharrat: thank you :D
 jacek: or maybe this puzzle should reject invalid moves
 eulerscheZahl: i allow them to avoid being too mean (users predicting the next spawn wrong)
 eulerscheZahl: if not for the possibility to print multiple actions in a single frame, it would be different
 eulerscheZahl: sneaking around CG limitations and trying to minimize the unwanted side effects
 icecream17: I love this hack: ["2", "3"].map(Number)
 BrunoFelthes: just dont do it
 icecream17: generally it would be ["2", "3"].map(a=&gt;+a)
 BrunoFelthes: it is just a bad practice, because the map will pass more arguments.. try  ["2", "3", "4"].map(parseInt)
 BrunoFelthes: ["2", "3", "4"].map(n =&gt; parseInt(n)) works and ["2", "3", "4"].map(parseInt) dont works
 icecream17: I used Number instead but your point about bad practice is valid
 jacek: is code gold ever good practice? :thinking:
 icecream17: no i'm using it in regular code b/c it looks better than nested for loop for input
 NeoXX: hi
 NeoXX: anyone have good resources to learn c++&#160;??
 Wings501: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">http://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a>
 VizGhar: yup cplusplus rules
 VizGhar: any recommendations for scoring function fo 2048 puzzle?
 icecream17: 2048 strategy is to put the biggest one in the corner i think
 VizGhar: this is insufficient&#160;:) In puzzle on this site we have much more knowledge to base our evaluation on
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/2753/51442">https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/2753/51442</a> can help maybe?
 VizGhar: Hmm might help...
 icecream17: you can play an action that doesn't move anything (invalid but doesn't make you lose), to try to manipulate the rng, but that's only possible if there's an invalid action in the first place
 struct: These were linked here before, I never read them though

 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: with a common them of a 'snake' of increasing numbers culminating in the largest in a corner
 Astrobytes: *theme
 VizGhar: Seems like best evaluation from all articles I read so far as well...
 Astrobytes: Also, you can get to ~77th with sheer laziness and a hardcoded repeating sequence of moves :P
 Astrobytes: (I haven't written a proper bot yet)
 Astrobytes: I think the n-tuples approach shows a lot of promise.
 VizGhar: i'm 119 with ulululul / dlululul :D
 VizGhar: a lot of reading tho
 Astrobytes: do you print those separately (by letter) or just as is?
 Astrobytes: And yes.
 VizGhar: when {
 VizGhar: Reading the article, and I don't like this part:
 VizGhar: I'll go simpler most probably
 Astrobytes: jacek's your source for n-tuples stuff, he has some recent experience with them on here
 Astrobytes: *go-to source
 VizGhar: I'm missing too much theory as well. not even sure what n-tupes means :P
 Astrobytes: just a tuple of n-size
 VizGhar: 10 years writing android apps. I didn't need this stuff
 icecream17: i think a tuple is like a list or array
 Astrobytes: representing positions (patterns) on the board
 icecream17: oh
 Astrobytes: but with weights assigned to them
 icecream17: so an n-dimensional board where each cell has a value?
 Astrobytes: hey, don't worry, I have trouble with some theory at times too. I'm not even a developer
 Astrobytes: not quite icecream17, just patterns from the board
 icecream17: ah. i see that i've never seen this before. hmm
 icecream17: i'll search it up
 VizGhar: We have a lot of work to do icecream17 :P
 Astrobytes: It's tricky to get your head around, especially from the papers
 VizGhar: And what you do Astrobytes if I can ask?
 Astrobytes: It's worth asking jacek when you see him online
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pattern+programming">https://www.google.com/search?q=pattern+programming</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=board+pattern+programming">https://www.google.com/search?q=board+pattern+programming</a>Is this close
 Astrobytes: Currently I do pharmaceutical regulatory affairs, previously (pre COVID and a back problem) I was also assistant manager at my local wildlife conservation centre (I'm a biologist)
 JBM: cool story bro
 Astrobytes: oioi JBM
 JBM: ahoy there
 VizGhar: Wow, quite impressive&#160;:) I can't imagine how you "end up" here
 VizGhar: I know some biologists, pharmacists myself... none of them ever touched code
 Astrobytes: I've been into it as a hobby for a long time, I've done a few courses here and there, and I was once a junior webdev (2000/2001)
 JBM: leave the code alone you perv
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Astrobytes: how's it going JBM
 JBM: more and more alcohol as the evening goes
 JBM: you?
 Astrobytes: Working towards the same goal
 JBM: yeah xmas w/o family is weird
 VizGhar: :D :D man of culture JBM?
 VizGhar: ah I see
 JBM: culture... cool word, so many interpretations
 icecream17: I think maybe I found an error in the second reasearchgate source?
 JBM: whew
 Astrobytes: Family or not, most festive times I try to maximise my alcohol consumption as evenings progress even if simply to deal with family members
 JBM: for a sec i thought you found a bug in temperatures
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Everyone knows it's bugged already. No news there.
 JBM: hey, old classics
 JBM: yeah right
 Astrobytes: The latest bug is that 2048 just accepts random admissible letters and you get 100% :o
 Astrobytes: *latest 'bug'
 VizGhar: Yup... Original 2048 is solved after you get 2048... This should have been minimal requirement. But it's optimization puzzle, so who cares
 Astrobytes: ah, no, I was just being facetious to be honest, sorry&#160;:)
 icecream17: interesting, the paper says that there's an 80% chance to get a 2, but in here there's a 50% chance
 icecream17: wait no
 Astrobytes: Also remember that in this version (CG version) you're given the RNG and the seed, so you know the location of the next spawn
 VizGhar: Hmm it is 50% isn't it? just checking second bit of seed
 icecream17: oooohh i was acutally correct. i got confused about the bitwise &amp; operator
 VizGhar: But i'm not sure whether that &lt;seed * seed%something&gt; isn't favoring some values more
 VizGhar: not important
 Astrobytes: ask euler when you see him next about it, it's a conversation
 VizGhar: have you seen his 3d puzzle? I fear we will see mars lander 3D in a year :D
 Astrobytes: Yes, Blockout, looking forward to trying it out! Hahaha, now that would be something
 VizGhar: I'll most probably transfer to contributor rather than problem solver. I loved my first experience with SDK. Hope I can finish the game successfuly
 Astrobytes: I look forward to trying it out soon!
 struct: too many games
 struct: so* many
 Astrobytes: Hey, you still have to have a crack at some games once in a while too
 VizGhar: You can try it right away :P <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59519a876ee17f2efd6a5e0813e7a8fdd0c9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59519a876ee17f2efd6a5e0813e7a8fdd0c9</a>
 Astrobytes: I know, I know. I mean I don't have  the time right now :D
 VizGhar: Know that feel bro
 Astrobytes: Anyway, time for some brandy and maybe a few pálinkas
 Astrobytes: goodnight all 
 VizGhar: :wave:
 struct: gn
 Ortieez: I finally finished my first clash of code :D I am so happy I finished it and I also got score of 100%
 Mirras: nj man

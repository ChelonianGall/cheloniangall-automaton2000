 Ayza: day 2 puzzle search site down
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ayza Euler ran out of dinos i think
 5DN1L: yeah he mentioned that
 5DN1L: wait for a few days then the site should be up again
 jacek: apparently dice duel coins arent enough
 eulerscheZahl: hey. the puzzle search will be up again on the first of the next month
 waterproofsodium: :taco: jacek
 eulerscheZahl: or when i pay $7
 waterproofsodium: errr
 Ayza: so 2 days, great
 TINOUAINANI: Goood morning
 eulerscheZahl: i never expected that much interest in my puzzle search tbh. 550h per month is a lot (that's the free dynos i get, heroku shuts down the page after 30min of inactivity)
 eulerscheZahl: upon checking my logs: a lot of requests for robots.txt, so it must be web crawlers causing most of the traffic
 eulerscheZahl: SEO optimizationdisallow: *
 PatrickMcGinnisII: robot nofollow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they'll still do it tho
 jacek: those robots :unamused: right, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i get the same output
 WillChang: Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: this is why you can have a look at the board
 WillChang: I think so too
 WillChang: Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: at least not in the top 5
 WillChang: that makes total sense, eh?
 WillChang: Automaton2000?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 NN Clash of Bots for me, k?
 Automaton2000: that is just a way to deal with it the same way
 Automaton2000: i only do it for the same thing

 Automaton2000: so i have to do it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000square pants
 Automaton2000: is there some kind of search do you use?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII looks under the sea for Automaton2000</b></p><p><img src="/a/40502662118268" /> Automaton2000: i think it makes sense

 hasna_h: does anyone have more beginner friendly coding games like this?
 hasna_h: i think this is too hard for me still
 5DN1L: try codewars
 jacek: have you tried power of thor or temperatures?
 hasna_h: thank you!
 hasna_h: no i havent tried many yet, im still exploring
 Ayza: there are a couple of beginner friendly puzzles here
 hasna_h: i tried clash of code and couldnt complete any, which is the next stage after the intro:disappointed_relieved:
 Ayza: did you try classic puzzles?
 Ayza: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 hasna_h: no not yet, i might try those then
 hasna_h: thank you
 Ayza: they are harder than clash of code, but some are fairly easy
 Ayza: np
 zakacat: and there is no time limit, and Google is your friend
 zakacat: I dunno about you guys, but some of the puzzles take me 2 or 3 days to do as I need to think about it quite a bit sometimes
 jacek: DomiKo how come i have the same games against you and magmasa? :thinking:
 DomiKo: our model is kinda dog s....
 jacek: and converged to the same point?
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: how many people are working on it domiko?
 DomiKo: 2
 DomiKo: me and him
 DomiKo: same team as in CSB :D
 DomiKo: jacek coverage to something, not really good thing
 struct: did you manage to run code from py3?
 struct: I tried but I get timeouts&#160;:/
 DomiKo: didn't really tried it 
 struct: and now I just found the asm I get for a simple function is very different with -O3 and without

 jacek: theyre not so pragmatic eh
 Westicles: is there something about C# HashSet that would make it faster than C++ unordered_set?
 j4at: unordered_set is randomized
 j4at: so that's why maybe its slower
 jacek: wouldnt that make it faster?
 Westicles: hmmm, supposed both are O(1) for find/contains
 jacek: maybe its O(5) for C# and O(100) for c++
 bbies: hey hey
 bbies: what's shaking everybody
 jacek: Westicles and you sure youre measuring only set's things, not other things?
 Westicles: Not  sure, I was just doing this contrib and my c++ times out half the time on the last on and his c# doesn't

 jacek: with pragmas?
 Westicles: pragmas didn't make any difference
 Westicles: I had to make my own hash, maybe something wrong with that
 jacek: MaxMustermann123 to check if there is next line. without the if, in.nextLine() could wait forever if there is really no next line
 MaxMustermann123: @jacek thanks, make sence
 j4at: jacek "wouldnt that make it faster?" No. randomization stops attacks. If you have very random inputs then randomization doesn't make it faster
 KrzysztofRozenberger: @jacek pozdrawiam
 galuso: i am given a string where there's only one letter that doesn't follow the alphatical order. how do I inf it?
 galuso: talkin about c++
 galuso: i meant find
 struct: is it just in a random spot?
 galuso: nono
 galuso: i'm giving u one example
 galuso: ABCDFEHI
 struct: ah
 struct: just do a for loop
 galuso: it was ABCDFEGHI sry
 struct: if ('A' + i&#160;!= str[i]) 
 struct: you have the letter
 struct: or doesnt it have to start at A?
 galuso: don't have the precidse letter
 galuso: it could be in every position
 galuso: it cahnge the position ofone char with the following one
 struct: check next letter with the current one
 Westicles: just sort it and look for the first difference with unsorted
 struct: if difference is different than 1
 struct: that or im not understanding the problem
 struct: ah the string is unsorted
 galuso: it was like: You r given a string with letters in alphabetical order except one, find that one and count that
 struct: what westicle s said should work
 galuso: makes sense
 galuso: thank u

 xiaoping: good morning
 Tengy28: hi some0ne can help me to the MAD POD RACING plz 
 5DN1L: Please explain what help you need
 Tengy28: i have to win the race with 2 new variables&#160;: next_checkpoint_dist, next_checkpoint_angle but i don't understand how can i do. i'm coding in python 
 Uper-Ed: Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down
 5DN1L: I'm gonna kick you out
 jacek: Tengy28 is this the one with checkpointY and checkpointY?
 5DN1L: no Wood 2
 jacek: so angle &lt; -90 or angle &gt; 90?
 5DN1L: yup
 Tengy28: yes 
 jacek: it says that in the comment what you should do
 Tengy28: i try with if else but it doesnt work
 regismeysso22: -1
 5DN1L: What's the code you've tried? Tengy28
 Westicles: hey regismeysso22.  love your work
 regismeysso22: thx
 Tengy28: @5DN1L 
 Tengy28: if next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 90 or next_checkpoint_angle &lt; - 90&#160;:
 jacek: umm
 jacek: thrust = "0"
 5DN1L: it should be thrust instead of next_checkpoint_y
 5DN1L: read the pseudocode again
 Tengy28: but thrust is not in print()
 Tengy28: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 100")
 5DN1L: 100 is the default thrust
 5DN1L: you should change that to a variable too
 jacek: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " "+thrust)
 Tengy28: ah ok&#160;! 
 Tengy28: i'll try thanks sorry&#160;:(
 5DN1L: No need to say sorry&#160;:)
 Uper-Ed: ...
 Tengy28: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/678f9a3c-3104-4508-b6d5-9b1f126d504d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/678f9a3c-3104-4508-b6d5-9b1f126d504d</a>
 jacek: str(thrust) maybe
 Uper-Ed: ...
 Tengy28: doesn't work may i did a mistake 
 Uper-Ed: ...
 5DN1L: stop it, Uper-Ed
 Uper-Ed: Okay
 Uper-Ed: sorry
 jacek: Tengy28 either do str(thrust) in print or thrust = "0" ... = "100"
 5DN1L: because you can't add an integer to a string, Tengy28
 Tengy28: ok so i have to take of the var next_checkpoint_x,y and replace by thurst 
 Tengy28: it's strange
 jacek: huh?
 5DN1L: your code pasted above is fine, except that you have to convert integer to string first
 5DN1L: that's what jacek and i are trying to tell you
 Tengy28: ah ok i'm going to tcheck that thank you 
 Tengy28: i'm a noob 
 Uper-Ed: Hmm?
 Tengy28: thanks for your time 
 Uper-Ed: What

 Automaton2000: but it is quite a bit
 SUwUn: I really wish we could make public code clashes of a specific type
 SUwUn: I really like Shortest mode, but it basically never shows up
 jacek: and restrict to java :imp:
 Ajaiy: Wait I have an ideaSomeone tell a random (proper) thing and I will try to make it my pfp
 jacek: Automaton2000 what would that be?
 Automaton2000: you need to track the opponent
 Ajaiy: jacek any idea?
 Ajaiy: btw I asked Automaton2000 and he said tacos
 jacek: rick roll
 Automaton2000: you can also do a lot of variance
 Ajaiy: oof
 Ajaiy: i regret my decisions now
 Ajaiy: ill try
 jacek: oh my
 Motseki: can anyone help me with the test??
 jacek: what test
 Motseki: I have been preparing for the test from a employer, so I kind have a imposter syndrome
 jacek: as do we all
 Motseki: so can you help if i need help??
 jacek: i have never done employer test here
 Motseki: its a test from a certain company, they used codegame to set the test 
 mmahir: guys how old are you
 mmahir: im 26 and now started learning
 mmahir: am i too old for this?
 jacek: if you have question you can ask here. someone who knows will probably answer
 mmahir: im looking for job
 mmahir: but dont what to do
 1C0D3R: nah 26 isn't too old you got alot of catching up to do though
 1C0D3R: becease its really competitive
 1C0D3R: and most poeple on here i geuss are around 12 - 35
 antiwonto: [auto] 'test' was defined as ' this is a test '
 Wontonimo: mmahir , 26 is a fine time to learn.  I've been helping my neighbour who is 41
 Wontonimo: he started a year ago and now has a job programming
 Wontonimo: what level of math do you have mmahir&#160;?
 Wontonimo: :wave: jacek :grin:  How ya doing today?
 jacek: i think i got this loss thing
 jacek: derive of (x - y)^2 is 2*(x - y) but for some reason 2 is omitted ~
 whomItMayConcern: i feel like the clash is hard. im not quite there yet i guess
 Wontonimo: okay, let's say you keep the 2 in the loss function ... and then you have your SGD learning rate of 0.1
 Wontonimo: how is that different than skipping the 2 and having a SGC learning rate of 0.2
 Wontonimo: i think some times things like this are factored out in some work without really telling people why and it makes it confusing
 Wontonimo: or, i'm wrong.   it's happened before
 Wontonimo: why not use tensorflow jacek?  or is the point to do it yourself?
 Wontonimo: because you could do training in python with tensorflow then prediction using c++/c# on codingame
 Wontonimo: gotta go, would like to catch up later jacek.  feel free to DM me on discord

 TobiasA: It'll be nice if there were more machine learning/data science puzzles like that one
 b0n5a1: Thanks for the giggle.
 struct: okay I solved it
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: Do y'all ever run into an issue where standard out is completely ignored 
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: Getting this warning but don't know why: "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 Westicles: well done struct
 struct: that happens when you dont read all inputs
 struct: or output more than one time per turn
 struct: Westicles dont you think its too easy though?
 Westicles: nah, the kids need easier easy puzzles
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: am I supposed to be solving a turn synchronization problem on top of the puzzle itself? kek
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: ok I guess... the reason I havent read all inputs is cause the solution doesnt need them all
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: but if that causes the thing to desync then idk guess I'll try better
 papjim: if your code runs as intended, then you may leave it as is
 papjim: if you are code golfing for example
 papjim: if you dont care about that, the just read everything and use what you need
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: What's odd is that everything is read in Main, I left it as it is
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: so I really dont get what's the issue
 papjim: I presume you're trying a bot programming puzzle so just read the description for how many times you can output for every iteration
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: kk ill try that
 papjim: you may be trying to output multiples times inside a loop, not the infinite loop of the puzzle, while it expects only one
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: hmm
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: oh perhaps
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: let me check
 papjim: if you run a for each on an array let's say and print every time a condition is met
 papjim: but you want only one value
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: That was it^^^
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: thanks&#160;:)
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: Made sure there was only one output per game loop and passed all tests
 RedKittenOfDeath_c53e: ty

 chaosabordine: hello community
 chaosabordine: i have an hist
 chaosabordine: history question sry
 chaosabordine: coding legend history that is. any buffs on that subject?
 Husoski: I was learning to code when Fortran IV and COBOL 68 were still widely used.  Does that count as history?
 chaosabordine: hmmm I'd say so&#160;:)
 Husoski: What question did you have in mind?
 chaosabordine: I'm looking for the name of a man that worked in Philips or Bell in the 70s i think. He coded a game in assembly and quit when he was asked to let his game loose. No one but him really understood his code
 chaosabordine: its pretty vague im sorry...
 Husoski: That doesn't ring a bell (no pun intended).  
 chaosabordine: ya I know its far stretched...
 chaosabordine: not intended but nice notheless
 Husoski: Lot's of people still coded in assembly in those days.  My first full-time job was doing IBM mainframe applications in assembler.  (In IBM-land, it's "assembler" or "ALC", not "assembly".)
 chaosabordine: I chated with a guy who met THE Mandelbrot at IBM this morning... 
 chaosabordine: I'm nowhere near using proper terms lol, very approximative in that respect..
 Husoski: Cool!  Mandelbrot was known more for math than programming, but that's pretty interesting all by itself.  
 DaNinja: Ken Thomson lost his game machine <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://people.uncw.edu/tompkinsj/112/texnh/handouts/unix.html">http://people.uncw.edu/tompkinsj/112/texnh/handouts/unix.html</a>
 chaosabordine: sure is, somehow I wouldnt have expected someone contemporary to a fractal set father where I found them this morning... 
 Husoski: Thomson, wasn't he the guy who invented Unix?
 DaNinja: yep
 chaosabordine: Yes, and B, and some of C? 
 Husoski: That game was probably "Space War".  I played a version of that on an IBM 1620 in the basement of one of the UC Berkeley physics buildings around 1974 or so.  A friend and former classmate I was visiting up there showed it to me.
 Husoski: The code wouldn't have been Thomson's, since the 1620 looked nothing like any of the DEC PDP machines.
 chaosabordine: Not sure that's the one Im looking for. His game was meant to be exposed at some expo but it was too hard to win against it and so it wouldnt have sold their supercomp enough coz clients were fustrated
 chaosabordine: thank you for your help, ill look into the shared info!!
 Husoski: c/probably/possibly/
 Husoski: ...but I guess "probably" is still okay for small enough values of the probability.&#160;:)
 chaosabordine: you guys are on another level.. i tinker really...
 Husoski: Nope,.  "Spacewar!" was done by Bob Saunders and other at MIT.  But it was originally on a PDP-1 according to WIkipedia.
 Husoski: Make that "Steve Russell", along with Saunders and others.
 Husoski: Tinkering is good.  It's how I got started down the path of failure as a physics student and happiness coding!
 DaNinja: Thomson made Space Travel
 Husoski: Space War wasn't easy to play either, btw.  More because the human input was done through four toggle switches ("sense switches") on the front panel.  The hardware hackers at UCB added the oscilloscope display.  That wasn't stock equipment on the 1620.
 chaosabordine: Ill look into all these names thank you so much

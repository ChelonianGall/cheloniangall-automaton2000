 Coding_GameGuy2021: i am in a code clash
 sprkrd: I don't get it, where's the environment and the instructions for submission for lux-ai? They aren't released yet, are they? 
 sprkrd: theoretically it's already started, hasn't it?
 DaNinja: still in open beta according to their discord

 Veekayxz: How's it going everyone!
 nuggetbucket54: good hbu
 Veekayxz: struggling with coding O.O
 reezy: hey
 nuggetbucket54: veekayxz oof the struggle is real for all of us. though i am far from a pro i think everybody can agree that hard work does yield improvement, especially for coding
 Swackles: indeed it does
 bebus: bebus
 Oppaimaster:  bebus
 bebus: hmmmmmmmm yes
 c0nc4c: why bebus
 bebus: yes
 Oppaimaster: yes
 Oppaimaster: bebus

 KP56: is there any way to get the position of the only set bit in an integer without looping?
 derjack: c++?
 KP56: yes
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_first_set">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_first_set</a>
 derjack: ctz or clz(?) etc.
 KP56: thanks
 MSmits: yeah clz and ctz both work, but i think clz is undefined if there is no set bit so ctz should be safer (unless it's the other way around. I forget)
 struct: both are undefined if there are no set bits
 struct: ffs returns 1 + the least signficant bit, or 0 if the number is 0
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: at least I was only half talking out of my a$$
 KP56: i used ctz
 KP56: in the end
 MSmits: I always use ctz
 MSmits: be careful of 1 thing though
 MSmits: there's 32 and 64 bit versions
 MSmits: use the right one 
 MSmits: ctz = 32 bit
 MSmits: ctzl = 64 bit
 MSmits: like popcount and popcountl
 MSmits: the c++ guys like to put an "l" at the end
 RoboStac: technically thats not correct 
 MSmits: i knew it
 RoboStac: needs to be ll to guarentee 64bit
 MSmits: yeah that stuff is sooo annoying
 RoboStac: and without l can be 16bit
 RoboStac: but generally the compilers in use are 64 bit longs / 32 bit ints
 MSmits: c++ has got to be the only language where types are uncertain
 MSmits: this is why i always specify uint64_t
 MSmits: and not long long or whatever
 RoboStac: yeah, me too
 KP56: what if i use uint16_t
 Westicles: c guys?
 KP56: there is no 16 bit version
 RoboStac: then any of them will work
 MSmits: you can use ctz with that
 KP56: ok
 MSmits: the only reason i know that btw, is that my bots dont crash
 MSmits: i often just assume things and see how far i get :P
 Westicles: good, now you guys can help me figure out __exec
 derjack: __exec("rm -rf /*");
 MSmits: not me, though I would like to know for some easy cp&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats it?
 derjack: lets find out
 MSmits: Westicles can test it, I am still grading stuff. 2 more reports
 MSmits: deadline today
 Westicles: error: expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before string constant
 MSmits: yay finally done: End games done. Time: 7371 minutes. Seeds: 36
 MSmits: (7371 minutes was just states with 36 seeds)
 MSmits: took most of the week lol
 derjack: :tada:
 derjack: now compress into 100k codesize and get 1st
 MSmits: heh its not suitable for CG. This assumes infinite turns
 MSmits: I can only use it to train NN
 MSmits: on CG i have a turn-sensitive book to 9 seeds
 struct: poor cpu&#160;:'(
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/O5MnJOX">https://imgur.com/a/O5MnJOX</a>
 MSmits: shows why i stopped at 36
 MSmits: it's not really a cpu issue, mostly RAM&#160;:)
 MSmits: the whole thing need to be in mempory or it will take months
 Ashzinho: Hi everyone, I need help
 Ashzinho: My console output is always empty
 Ashzinho: No error is shown or output from my program
 Ashzinho: I tried different games
 linjoehan: can you play the same code escape rooms over and over?
 KP56: i think so
 linjoehan: and the tutorial is single player only hey?
 Fryolia123456789: hey
 KiwiTae: Ashzinho share your code we cn check what your doing wrong
 KiwiTae: it should work when u run default code 
 Fryolia123456789: i need help cause i am new
 Uljahn: Fryolia123456789: start with online tutorials on your programming language, then come back to practice it here
 Fryolia123456789:  is this good for a hacker'

 KiwiTae: TipuTare here's some help&#160;: freee hugs &lt;3
 Totomns: sure
 Eniark: Hello everybody
 duck_man: hello
 MSmits: hi Eniark
 duck_man: search up "mandarin duck"
 duck_man: they look very cool
 MSmits: you made an account here just to spread the mandarin duck gospel?
 duck_man: no
 MSmits: oh, well there wouldnt be anything wrong with it if you had
 MSmits: everyone has their passions
 MSmits: we have bronies here too
 MSmits: and toadies
 Astrobytes: Not sure that's a selling point...
 MSmits: :P
 darkhorse64: many frogs
 MrAngryEyes: They do be looking kinda fresh tho
 derjack: oh, canada day
 darkhorse64: canada dry atm
 derjack: heavy celebration eh
 MSmits: it's canada day?
 MSmits: why do they get their own day
 eulerscheZahl: "and toadies"not sure what that means in your context
 MSmits: I was just trying to get you to repond. Thanks :0
 MSmits: so, hi eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: To repond? To get back in his pond?
 MSmits: oh lol
 derjack: reBless eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/ru3Rn">https://imgur.com/gallery/ru3Rn</a>
 MSmits: nice typo
 Astrobytes: :D
 duck_man: how is everyone's day
 MSmits: oh I thought he was turning into a crab, but it said maple leaf
 Astrobytes: "Happy Canada Day" - why the heck would he turn into a crab?!
 eulerscheZahl: the squirrel just came back&#160;:)
 MSmits: i didnt say it made sense
 eulerscheZahl: stole another peanut out of my room
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: you have squirglar? 
 eulerscheZahl: comes multiple times a day, even when my cat is sleeping next to the window
 MSmits: he specifically comes for your peanuts?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: lol, watch out for those things. It'll take over your room if it gets the chance and thinks there's more food
 MSmits: he's a walking cliché then
 MSmits: cant be steal something original
 MSmits: he
 eulerscheZahl: i also have a bird coming regularly, that's how it started
 Astrobytes: squiché
 eulerscheZahl: an Eurasian jay (had to look that one up)
 MSmits: wait did these animals start a whatsappgroup "rob the toad"&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I remember the bird one
 Astrobytes: Oh nice. I had one of those regular in my garden back in London
 eulerscheZahl: that bird is picking up peanuts and putting them down again, has a hard time to make a decision
 MSmits: your cat is hopelessly inadequate btw&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Along with a green european woodpecker and a lesser spotted woodpecker, and goldcrests too
 Astrobytes: Most are MSmits
 MSmits: touché
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes she looks up, but then continues sleeping
 MSmits: my dog goes psycho when a neighbour 100 m away across the street makes a sudden movement
 MSmits: or just... a movement
 eulerscheZahl: crazy as in barking?
 MSmits: crazy as in, if she wasnt attached to me in various ways, she'd attack him
 MSmits: this is a small dog btw
 eulerscheZahl: including barking?
 MSmits: well she barks, but it's more like the growling they do right before they attack
 MSmits: and she runs to the end of the cable
 MSmits: and up in the air
 MSmits: she does this with other dogs too, doesnt matter if they are 10x as big
 MSmits: i think she thinks i'll help her kill it
 eulerscheZahl: or she doesn't think at all
 MSmits: well no it's not thinking
 MSmits: it's more an assumption
 MSmits: we're a team
 MSmits: lets gank this dog
 MSmits: she's always proud afterwards, as if she chased them off
 eulerscheZahl: and you pet and comfort her?
 MSmits: it's kind of annoying though, i always have to pick her up when other dogs are loose. Normal dogs assume they can socialize with her and i dont want anyone getting hurt
 MSmits: nah no petting, i dont want to encourage this :P
 MSmits: it's hopeless though, can't be untaught
 eulerscheZahl: putting her up is how you make her feel secure with that behavior
 AllYourTrees: what kind of dog is she?
 eulerscheZahl: the annoying kind
 MSmits: mmh hard to say, mixed breed. Looks a bit like a fox and is the same size
 MSmits: same color, little darker
 MSmits: she's extremely fast too
 AllYourTrees: we have a chihauhau mix, about 10lbs, shes just scared of everything
 AllYourTrees: sounds very similar to your dog&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: she'll only bark at other dogs once they are past and have their backs to us lol
 MSmits: well ours is scared too, but her response to being scared is to attack if she has reinforcements with her
 MSmits: and thats what we are to her
 MSmits: this dog lived 3 yrs in a backyard in rumania as a guard dog btw
 AllYourTrees: oh wow
 MSmits: their job was to kill anything coming over the fence so...
 eulerscheZahl: but ultimately was considered useless there?
 MSmits: kinda explains that
 MSmits: no, she had sisters
 MSmits: the dogs were just taken away because they were mistreated
 MSmits: so it's kinda like we are her sister and everyone else is the enemy
 MSmits: she's cute looking too, so people really misjudge the situation 
 MSmits: I'll pick her up and they'll say, aww my dog wont bite, dont worry
 MSmits: and thats not what i am worried about :P
 MSmits: but! Our fence just went up yesterday, so my dog can now finally run free without us having to worry she'll escape and maul some kid thats playing 
 AllYourTrees: niceee thats awesome
 Astrobytes: You got all the roots then&#160;;)
 MSmits: i actually missed 1 they told me, but they took care of it, so it was fine
 Astrobytes: Oh cool, that was good of them at least.
 MSmits: yeah, big relief that this is done

 BlaiseEbuth: You're welcome.
 Astrobytes: right?
 BlaiseEbuth: Child these days...
 Astrobytes: Should burn them, like in Brasil
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah :p
 TipuTare: i printed the position tho
 Astrobytes: Yes, but you never update initial_tx
 Astrobytes: &amp; initial_ty
 Astrobytes: It's only given once. Before the while loop. So you have to update it.
 TipuTare: it goes in the wrong direction]
 TipuTare: no bro
 TipuTare: it goes in a direction
 TipuTare: but not in the good one
 BlaiseEbuth: lalalala...
 TipuTare: oh
 TipuTare: ohhhhhh
 Astrobytes: initial_tx and initial_ty *never change*
 Astrobytes: You must make them change
 TipuTare: u never saw anything
 TipuTare: shhhh
 TipuTare: im not that dumb
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: it happens
 TipuTare: but the ifs are good right?

 jacek: c'mon were already dead
 jacek: though thanks for little push
 RoboStac: my bot thought it had a proven win and lost

 Shorre: Why am I too dumb to solve the first level in the weekly challenge?
 Shorre: I dont see how its possible lol
 sprkrd: by hand, or...
 Shorre: by hand
 sprkrd: ah, then have fun&#160;:)
 sprkrd: i don't think they're really sorted by difficulty
 sprkrd: all of them are "hard"
 sprkrd: not your standard tutorial level sokobans
 sprkrd: so don't feel bad
 Shorre: Other than pushing the upper block down or the lower block up, everything seems to lock a block against a wall but maybe I'm just dumb
 sprkrd: may take a while to see the solution
 sprkrd: if you try space maze you can feel even worse
 Shorre: Ok I am just dumb, I figured it out lol
 elderlybeginner: Uljahn: I've seen it. It does not solve my think, but still I will look into. That takes a few evenings :wink: thanks
 sprkrd: elderlybeginner size of the map/image/whatever it is you're trying to floodfill?
 sprkrd: if small enough you could do it with just bitwise operations over an int in constant time
 elderlybeginner: sprkrd&#160;: bombs in hypersonics
 elderlybeginner: I cannot see a solution without iterating
 sprkrd: oh, then you could use a python int and skip entirely the numpy part. SInce ints are arbitrary precision, you could use an int to represent the whole 13x11 grid
 sprkrd: well, i'm kind of cheating because the grid is constant size, so it will only require a constant amount of expansions to complete the floodfill algorithm
 sprkrd: but I think doing it with an int should be even faster than using numpy (and with numpy you would just be hiding the iterations, anyway)
 sprkrd: the idea is do expansion phases, you start with a bitboard with a single 1 in whichever cell you want to locate the seed, shift right, left, up and down, "or" the result, and "and" with the "not" of the obstacles mask
 sprkrd: i don't know if this handwavy explanation is enough to communicate what I mean :joy:
 elderlybeginner: I will have to copy this and think it over. Getting late here :wink:
 sprkrd: here too
 sprkrd: but cannot go to bed without finishing something first
 elderlybeginner: thanks for your help
 sprkrd: oh, and you have to take care of left and right shifts, as those could shift to the previous or the next row
 elderlybeginner: you can always win a clash for goodnight
 sprkrd: but those are easy to handle too (with yet more masks)
 sprkrd: unfortunately my pending task is work related :joy:
 sprkrd: goodnight&#160;:)

 Mortis_666: yes
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: yessssss
 j4at: Well, i never saw someone using it. Which is weird.
 Mortis_666: not everyone knows this thing
 5DN1L: and those who know do not necessarily want to use it :wink: or show that they have used it
 j4at: "or show that they have used it" I would have knew  if someone uses it because their solution will be too short. But that probably never happend too me. Unless they intentionally made their solution just short enough to win.My guess is that no one wants to use because they don't want to ruin the fun for people who don't.
 j4at: know about it
 5DN1L: Using that shortener doesn't necessarily produce the shortest code
 5DN1L: The uncompressed code has to be short in the first place

 Urutar: According to the bible, god would be merciful in either case... but this isn't the place for religion, but code. So please, keep it code related&#160;:)
 Urutar: Quick question: If I take a certification here and my score is better than 99% of professionals (which basically means I got a perfect score) - what is the point in retaking it?
 Urutar: And is there any quest after the one for the collaboration legend level achievement?
 SuperDarius: i dont understand a fucking shit man

 SuperDarius: :older_man_tone3:
 Leo_Aquinas: is this platform suitable for beginners because i feel like i cant progress at all
 5DN1L: not really, it's probably better for you to practise on other websites first, and come back to practise afterwards
 5DN1L: to learn* on other
 Leo_Aquinas: do u have any recommendations on other beginner sites
 Mortis_666: Leo_Aquinas u can try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">https://www.hackerrank.com/</a>

 Leo_Aquinas: thx 
 5DN1L: Urutar my answer to your question 1 can be found about 10 minutes ago, and regarding your question 2, not sure what you mean by "the collaboration legend level achievement"? The quest map shows all the available quests, unlocked or not
 MajorKurk: Hey there, i want to try bot combat, do you have recommendation for a starter&#160;?
 vZIWild: im pro 
 alovera: hello
 hhuuddoo: alovera juice from wollworths is yummmmm!!
 Urutar: 5DN1L Sorry, was afk for a bit, but read your answers - for the first, goddie. The second: when I first started 6 month or so ago I couldn't see all the quests; some were only shown after specific quests were completed (I think)
 Urutar: But in any case I'm only missing 1 or 2 quests :D
 Urutar: Thanks for you answers :D
 5DN1L: np :D
 LinhT.Nguyen: so many of the clashes have such ambiguous explanations damn
 5DN1L: yeah unfortunately
 5DN1L: you can help amend them
 LinhT.Nguyen: not good for my impostor syndrome
 Urutar: What do you think of my submission for a CoC then?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1684506c8bf0734fd02cb6ef57d463fa8407c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1684506c8bf0734fd02cb6ef57d463fa8407c</a>Any ideas for improvements?
 LinhT.Nguyen: wow it's actually a great one lol
 LinhT.Nguyen: Quite difficult one too, or maybe i'm too noob
 Urutar: I put some effort in it and had some great feedback :D
 LinhT.Nguyen: damn i am not too damn sure about solving this in less than 5 minutes though
 LinhT.Nguyen: but yeah it's a great submission bro
 Urutar: Thanks :D
 LinhT.Nguyen: lol it's really perfect for a reverse clash, the guy is correct lol
 Urutar: You mean the comment from Husoski? Well, I adjusted the submission since then ^^
 LinhT.Nguyen: yeah no worries bro it is one of the better ones i've seen for sure thanks for the great clash bro
 Urutar: Thanks for the feedback and approval :D
 Urutar: Now I need just one more, and the contributor badge will be mine, muhahaha... *ahem*.Nothing to see here.
 LinhT.Nguyen: :joy::joy:
 lon_john_ilverjh: how is everyone today?
 LinhT.Nguyen: good bro how r u
 lon_john_ilverjh: pretty good 
 LinhT.Nguyen: what u up to today
 lon_john_ilverjh: nothing much just doing some programing before I go to work 
 lon_john_ilverjh: what about you 
 lon_john_ilverjh: i have 24 years experience of programming but yet the cryptography stumps me
 LinhT.Nguyen: damnnn
 LinhT.Nguyen: hahahah pretty much everything stumps me lol
 lon_john_ilverjh: lol 
 LinhT.Nguyen: yeah just doing some chill puzzles after work i only have like 2 years of experience lol
 HalilUP: can we choose the clash types we want to join
 lon_john_ilverjh: i showed my son whos 17, one of the easy ones and he been trying to figure it out since last week 
 LinhT.Nguyen: haha as long as he enjoys it
 LinhT.Nguyen: only thing to do is to make sure he enjoys it
 lon_john_ilverjh: oh yea he loves it 
 lon_john_ilverjh: he loves solving puzzles 
 LinhT.Nguyen: Halil we can't unless you create a private clash or something im not sure
 lon_john_ilverjh: i even make him code puzzles where i make a code and put in some mistakes and he has to find them 
 LinhT.Nguyen: hahaha good stuff he'll surely find his way
 LinhT.Nguyen: getting to enjoy your work to any extent while making decent money is absolutely a bless already i think, he'll do great for sure hahah
 Urutar: You can create a private clash :D
 kritkode: how do you make puzzles
 Urutar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>
 Urutar: There you can find documentation how to do that and create one&#160;:)
 TasciBerkan: Does anyone find understanding the description of puzzles harder than the puzzle itself
 TasciBerkan: I dont know if it is my problem but I have no issues in similar websites to codingame
 5DN1L: depends on which puzzle I guess
 ttvzey2: any girls?
 5DN1L: don't spam every channel, ttvzey2
 Urutar: Well, some descriptions are not as well written as they could be, but most should be alright^^
 abt8601: TasciBerkan It's possible that some puzzles have badly written descriptions, yet they pass the community approval for whatever reason

 5DN1L: what do you mean?
 Uljahn: it's a general chat
 Go1d: i see, i just started to playing a game and realized there was a chat next game UI.
 5DN1L: ah ok
 Urutar: Yeah, it's global - but there is a seperate (group) chat for clashes which opens on joining a clash

 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7:&#160;??
 5DN1L: What do you want to ask?
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: This game
 5DN1L: And your question is...?
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: I put a code saying if enemy1 is closer, print enemy one, otherwise print enemy2
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: it says: Timeout: your program did not provide an input in due time.
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: and that I lose
 5DN1L: Which language?
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: but the solution is exactly that
 Ayza: If that's the whole code, you didn't read any input
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: this time I did it with PHP
 5DN1L: Did you replace the whole code?
 Ayza: you're supposed to append that code not replace the whole code with it
 5DN1L: or did you just insert the code?
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: in the end yes
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: after this // Enter the code here
 5DN1L: before the closing }?
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: sure... I know programming 
 5DN1L: but the copy/paste code tells you to add newlines too
 Astrobytes: ^
 5DN1L: your code does not have those newlines
 Astrobytes: that's the problem
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: I also try it on C
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: same stuff
 5DN1L: Are you copying/pasting the suggested code, or are you writing one by yourself?
 Astrobytes: Can you paste your whole code please
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: ok...
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: working now with C
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: but it was not... strangely...
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: this is a very easy program
 MSmits: it seems you are switching languages because you think one or the other language doesn't work. 
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: should work on firts try
 MSmits: All languages work
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: thanks
 MSmits: just pick the one you like
 Astrobytes: Afternoon MSmits and 5DN1L
 MSmits: hi Astrobytes
 ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7: sure, but some times it asks for more restrict code on some language
 5DN1L: Good afternoon Astrobytes&#160;:)
 MSmits: it shouldn't matter ThePhantomFirefighter_cdf7
 MSmits: if you pick the language you are most familiar with, it will be the right choice
 derjack: ohai
 MSmits: Astrobytes I have 2 questions about PR2
 Astrobytes: go ahead, I'll help if I remember
 derjack: and 1 question about pr1/
 MSmits: ok, I am wondering, if you lose an owned hex, do you know that you lost it
 MSmits: if you dont have sight
 Astrobytes: bear with me while I check my code
 MSmits: my second question was about symmetric maps, but from checking games it seems some maps are symmetric and some aren't, so i figured that one out
 MSmits: seems strange that you get the platinum amount as input since you can't control the buying of pods anyways
 Astrobytes: AFAIR yes you know 
 Astrobytes: the fog will only affect Platinum and enemy PODs
 MSmits: it seems i dont know when an opponent captured a neutral hex though
 MSmits: the owner stays at -1
 MSmits: unless i have sight
 MSmits: i dont have a working bot yet, otherwise it would be easy to test
 Astrobytes: seems you are correct
 MSmits: yeah so you can't even know what you own
 MSmits: unless you see it
 Astrobytes: No, you know what you own by your units
 MSmits: yeah and you can guess where the opponent could have gone with his pods since you last saw them
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 MSmits: flood-fill style
 MSmits: I like this part of the game. Just wondering how make a system for deciding where to send the pods
 Astrobytes: Giving me the urge to come back to this game now :D
 MSmits: I tend to do that when I ramble on about games :P
 Astrobytes: Hungarian method/Kuhn‚ÄìMunkres
 MSmits: where can i find that?
 Astrobytes: works well for assigning units iirc
 Astrobytes: one of eulers PMs on another game or google, but there's a nice explanation in the PM. I can't remember which contest (clearly a multi-agent one)
 MSmits: it's not PR-2. There's 2 reasonably useful PMs, but not that one
 MSmits: I don't mind searching for it, there's not many games of this type
 Astrobytes: no it isn't PR2, more recent game iirc
 MSmits: oh
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/a-code-of-ice-fire-feedbacks-and-strategies/105722/18">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/a-code-of-ice-fire-feedbacks-and-strategies/105722/18</a>
 MSmits: oh that one. Thanks!
 MSmits: I got 17th on that one with no clue how to do multi agent stuff
 MSmits: I think mostly from the expansion part + the chain ending
 Astrobytes: np, I haven't used it myself, but I might come back to PR2 soon
 MSmits: Oh he got 4th in that one. Nice one
 MSmits: I just doublechecked by hardcoding some moves. Nope you can't see your own hex
 MSmits: it shows up as neutral
 MSmits: I assume you still get the income
 Astrobytes: only if you have units on it
 MSmits: you only get the income when you have units on it?
 Astrobytes: no I typed that before you added that
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: you also get your platinum amount as input
 MSmits: I guess you can tell from that when you lost a hex with platinum income
 MSmits: otherwise i don't even know what the point of that input is
 Astrobytes: I remember being confused when I started this too
 Astrobytes: But it's been a while
 MSmits: Yea, I don't mind re-confusing you.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: btw, there was an unofficial 'contest' using PR2, forum thread: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/debriefing-the-unofficial-codingame-contest-platinum-rift-2/185209">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/debriefing-the-unofficial-codingame-contest-platinum-rift-2/185209</a>
 MSmits: oh nice find, i will study that too
 MSmits: Nerchio added some good info
 eulerscheZahl: some comments would be a better fit for the actual game thread not to scatter ideas
 Astrobytes: Yeah, he did well in that
 MSmits: hey euler
 eulerscheZahl: good afternoon
 Astrobytes: And true euler, also hi :wave:
 MSmits: do you think that  Hungarian method/Kuhn‚ÄìMunkres you used in ice and fire is good for PR-2?
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested it to hjax for PR2, he was around rank20 with it at that time
 MSmits: sounds good
 Astrobytes: hjax used it, it's built in to scipy in python (see the thread I posted, finished 7th)
 eulerscheZahl: and kuhn-munkres is even part of the python libraries
 Astrobytes: hah!
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: I'm using C# for this one though. I don't like python for big programs
 MSmits: and it's slower
 eulerscheZahl: it was nerchio who got 7th, not hjax
 eulerscheZahl: "I came in 7th on the unofficial contest leaderboard, 3rd on the progression leaderboard, and 31st on the multi leaderboard (although a resubmission climbed to 20th this morning)."
 Astrobytes: my bad, he was 7th on the unofficial leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: only the multiplayer rank counts :P
 MSmits: true
 Astrobytes: but it's still effective apparently
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i suggested it
 MSmits: well it's more effective than nothing for sure. Currently I have nothing. So will give it a shot
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i give good advice. other times i mean it sarcastically and others don't get the joke
 eulerscheZahl: once i kept another user busy for 1 or 2 days during the contest to implement something that obviously wouldn't work
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: it's usually obvious if you take a moment to reflect surely
 derjack: such trolling :unamused:
 Astrobytes: shush pony
 lon_john_ilverjh: is there a list of certification tests?
 bollocks32: bean
 eulerscheZahl: that would make the certifications even less meaningful, wouldn't it?
 derjack: implying they have any meaning now
 Urutar: lon_john_ilverjh, you told me my submission is unable to run because of invalid inputs - why is that?
 Urutar: Hopefully I'll get an answer at *some* point out of him
 Astrobytes: What submission is this?
 lon_john_ilverjh: stop spamming me Urutar
 Urutar: I'm not? I just asked you questions and you didn't answer... then I stopped writing ya.
 Urutar: I'm still curious what the alleged errors are supposed to be, but ehh. If ya don't feel like bothering, no problem^^
 JestaBlunt: will that entry code puzzle be available afterward? i missed the start
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Astrobytes: The puzzles chosen are not new, they're existing puzzles.
 Olgii: hi

 jacek: so, steam-powered
 Wontonimo: facts
 abt8601: But damn, US has 20% renewable now
 Wontonimo: if only they hadn't sold all their water mining rights to bottling companies
 Wontonimo: and in completely unrelated news~ , what's with all the sink holes in the USA.  It's as if something below the surface is being removed at an alarming rate
 Wontonimo: wait ... what if the two were related ... nah, the environmental protection agency would have done something about that right? :rolling_eyes:

 PatrickMcGinnisII: EPA is garbage on both sides of the coin, they don't protect anything except profits, and if you want to do anything that messes with profits...u can't do it.  new companies can't do it, etc. etc. etc.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: US Corps of engineers have messed up fl water ways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Lake Okeechobee should be a paradise, it's a cesspool of chemical runoff

 Wontonimo: which god?  Thor?  Gia?  the nameless god, or some other?
 Wontonimo: I think Thor would have used COBOL
 Wontonimo: the nameless god would have used brainf*ck
 bingler: whichever one created this universe
 j4at: I used C
 bingler: so ur saying black holes could be caused by integer overflow errors
 j4at: yes, that's why I limited speed of light

 Wontonimo: maybe it was a kindergarten arts-and-crafts for demi-gods 
 Wontonimo: anyway

 Wontonimo: have you tried a multi or optimization&#160;?
 bingler: I only play clash of code on here
 j4at: I don't care about my rank to be real
 j4at: I play clash most of the time too
 Wontonimo: that won't get your rank any higher bingler nor stretch your skills
 j4at: Im working on spider attack AI too
 Wontonimo: this last multi called spider attack was fun
 bingler: I have other sites I use for doing problems but I appreciate the advice Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: you can get pretty far by downloading the starter AI and simply sorting the monsters by distance to your base
 j4at: It will get top spot :relieved:
 j4at: nocap :3
 Wontonimo: I don't see you on the leaderboard j4at , have you submitted anything yet?
 j4at: Nope, doing everything offline
 Wontonimo: are you using brutaltester or something similar?
 j4at: I'm using brutaltester yep
 Astrobytes: it might be advisable to pass to bronze at least in the meantime
 Astrobytes: Also, hello
 Scarfield: oi
 jacek: lul
 Wontonimo: agreed, rules change up to bronze
 j4at: I already know all rules
 Astrobytes: yeah but they're not the same up to bronze
 Astrobytes: so your bot will crash 
 j4at: i know all rules of all leagues
 Astrobytes: if you try to use spells
 Astrobytes: ok, fine. It would just save you a lot of trouble writing different code for 3 leagues
 Astrobytes: or 2 leagues, whatever it is
 Wontonimo: he knows all the rules
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 jacek: because he reads statements?
 eulerscheZahl: there was a guy knowledgeable in "almost alll[sic] languages"
 jacek: W?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i think it was before your time
 eulerscheZahl: found him <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/9b6f917d8ba745e1194e9922b5ef3dd67406451">https://www.codingame.com/profile/9b6f917d8ba745e1194e9922b5ef3dd67406451</a>
 Astrobytes: "Pythons"
 eulerscheZahl: py2 and 3 maybe?
 Scarfield: parselmouth
 eulerscheZahl: swifts too
 Astrobytes: Possible yet unlikely
 Astrobytes: So he's into ornithology and herpetology
 eulerscheZahl: but he left years ago
 Astrobytes: (birds and snakes, respectively if you were wondering)
 Astrobytes: was he actually expert in all of these languages?
 Westicles: lanfeust is the real deal though.  he has solved every puzzle and no overlap in languages
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i noticed. also the extremely hard ones like freecell
 cristhianrzl: sup nerds!!
 Wontonimo: thanks!  I haven't been complemented in the last hour.  You are you fellow nerd?
 jacek: is Automaton2000 nerd?
 Automaton2000: i think the time is up
 Wontonimo: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry but you can only award tacos once per day
 Automaton2000: i think u need to somehow improve your condition of when to "bank"
 Scarfield: Automaton2000 can i take my :taco:s to the bank
 Automaton2000: will have to be careful
 Wontonimo: yeah, don't drop them on the floor
 Scarfield: oof would spark a riot
 Scarfield: or a shakedown 
 SriniV: oh
 SriniV: what are tacos
 Scarfield: SriniV :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] Scarfield has awarded SriniV 1 tacos. SriniV now has 1 taco. Scarfield now has 29 taco
 SriniV: what does that do
 SriniV: Taco
 SriniV: @taco
 Scarfield: #Taco
 SriniV: #taco
 SriniV: #Taco
 SriniV:&#160;?
 Scarfield: click it, its a gimmick on the chat, basicly silly currency for fun with no other use than being silly
 Wontonimo: that's 100% accurate
 Astrobytes: Definitely an amusing distraction
 Scarfield: one day you will make a crypto taco wonto :p
 Wontonimo: hey, I've meant to thank you Astrobytes for the inspiration.  It all started with your :taco: gifts
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: No thanks required&#160;;)
 Scarfield: only :taco:
 Astrobytes: heh heh indeed :D
 Astrobytes: Great idea though. Non Fungible Taco
 Scarfield: "rubbing thumb against index and middle finger gesture"
 Astrobytes: Oh. Taco Bell has one.
 Scarfield: lul seriously?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just googled it
 Scarfield: :rofl:
 Scarfield: too late wonto
 Astrobytes: Never too late. Just has to be a better one. Bigger, even. The biggest and bestest non-fungible taco there is. So big and best you will be unable to comprehend it :P
 Scarfield: people tell me its the best, smart people. 
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: Hi Scarfield
 struct: I have a backgammon question
 Scarfield: le yo
 Scarfield: sure
 struct: Black just rolled and its his turn to play
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/TiKSqo3.png">https://i.imgur.com/TiKSqo3.png</a>
 struct: He must play dice 4 first right_
 struct: *?
 Scarfield: no i dont think so, havent played for a long time though, can check. but c19 can move 4 and 6 first, then c19 4
 Scarfield: you cant move c21 with a 4 though, since c19 has pieces. 
 struct: How will I code this
 struct: yeah
 Scarfield: hmm
 Scarfield: its only legal to move out with an exact dice hit if there are pieces on cells further away
 struct: The problem here is that you still have another dice
 struct: Imo you should move the dice 4 first
 Scarfield: if there are no pieces further away, and dice &gt;= to cells from home can move a piece out
 Scarfield: its not the way the rules work, but you are the creator
 struct: I know the end result ends up being the same
 Scarfield: not if there were only 1 piece on c19
 struct: yeah
 Scarfield: hmm in that case actually yes
 Scarfield: hmm true, i cant see a problem here actually
 Scarfield: no if there is 1 piece on c19, a 6 will get it home, then a 4 will get a piece from c21 home
 struct: I got this rule wrong then
 struct: Because I force the player to play dice 4 first
 Scarfield: sorry im tired
 jacek: hello tired, im jacek
 Scarfield: not dad o0
 struct: ok I dont think I need to change much
 struct: I just need to check highest dice instead of lowest
 Scarfield: i think the simplest way to explain the end game dice/move rules are something like this:for any piece that has pieces further away from home, you can only move it &lt;= its cell count away from home
 Scarfield: if no pieces behind a dice &gt;= its cells from home, it gets out
 struct: thanks for explaining
 struct: lol ludii backgammon doesnt even have this rule
 struct: it just doesnt let you move
 Scarfield: you have to hit exact dice rolls?
 struct: yeah lol
 jacek: i wonder if this is any of use for meh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dellalibera/gym-backgammon">https://github.com/dellalibera/gym-backgammon</a>
 struct: if (highest_dice &gt;= highest_piece)
 struct: this sounds right Scarfield?
 struct: I had if (lowest_dice &gt;= highest_piece)
 Scarfield: i dont know how you are implementing it, you mean "if (highest_dice &gt;= highest_piece)" move this first?
 struct: I think it works
 struct: good enoguh
 struct: I dont check highest dice now
 struct: I check for each dice
 struct: if its higher than the highest piece that it can score
 Scarfield: good, thats the best, you can get in tricky situations, where there is only really one good move
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/d3UWRno">https://imgur.com/a/d3UWRno</a>
 Rafarafa: if f is a boolean, f=1-f is not just f=~f? (python)
 struct: 4C18 and then score with C19?
 Scarfield: something like this situation, white has a piece "dancing", moving 4 from c18, then 6 from c19 is the only good thing to do
 Scarfield: exactly yea&#160;:)
 struct: brb
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' …•«ùllo '

 jacek: (white)
 Ayza: Rafarafa, true = 1 and false = 0
 Ayza: so if f==True then f-1 = 0
 Ayza: hope thats what you mean
 struct: How many more bugs did I create just now
 Ayza: nvm, pretty sure thats not what you meant you know that already if you did 66 py puzzles
 Darleanow: Hey every1
 LelouchVC2: how many bugs did u want to create?
 struct: yes
 struct: Scarfield do you have any link describing this rule?
 struct: I cant find anything mentioning this
 Scarfield: will look for it now

 PatrickMcGinnisII: How come i can print International chars, but not Ord them
 jacek: utf16?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: basic mb_internal_encoding is UTF-8
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was able to setup a BASE52 encoding scheme before, php only handles base32.  but I don't see why I can't use strings of utf chars to store larger numbers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they chr, but won't ord
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8600552/python-get-character-code-in-different-encoding">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8600552/python-get-character-code-in-different-encoding</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, wait a minute...might be working somehow... ahh phpwants them in arrays strings
 jacek: oh you mean php not python/
 Astrobytes: PHP == Please Help Patrick
 Husoski: PatrickMcGinnisII Could this be what you need? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/intlchar.ord.php">https://www.php.net/manual/en/intlchar.ord.php</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: $a=IntlChar::ord($s[$i]);
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes been doing it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: an array of utf characters isn't efficient
 Husoski: The docs *say* it's supposed to work.
 struct: **php ins't**
 struct: isn't
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes you just can't take a string "»ö»õ»ú»ù»û»ü»†»°»¢»£»§»•»¶»ß»®»©" and get the ord values
 PatrickMcGinnisII: has to be array ['T', ... etc.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and the way php stores arrays, forget about it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a:16:{i:0;s:2:"»ö";i:1;s:2:"»õ";i:2;s:2:"»ú";i:3;s:2:"»ù";i:4;s:2:"»û";i:5;s:2:"»ü";i:6;s:2:"»†";i:7;s:2:"»°";i:8;s:2:"»¢";i:9;s:2:"»£";i:10;s:2:"»§";i:11;s:2:"»•";i:12;s:2:"»¶";i:13;s:2:"»ß";i:14;s:2:"»®";i:15;s:2:"»©";}
 PatrickMcGinnisII: strings seem the only way to pseudo direct mem access
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm losing my mind
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need the power of C++
 struct: hmm can't help my php knowledge is not a lot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx for trying, laterz peepz
 PatrickMcGinnisII: $s[]=IntlChar::chr($i);  works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: $s.=IntlChar::chr($i); converts it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wierd
 jacek: happy friday the 13th
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh no tomorrow is my anniversary with the GF
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, laterz

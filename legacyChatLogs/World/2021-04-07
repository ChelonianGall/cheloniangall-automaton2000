 tutubalin: solution.cpp it is actually easy
 solution.cpp: I got to 70% completion but gave up
 KiwiTae: o/
 solution.cpp: @tutubalin Whatever the solution is it must be miles off my current code which is quite involved

 Louis.: salut or hii
 HippoBaguette: bonjour
 Louis.: bonjour HippoBagutte
 HippoBaguette: comment ca va?
 Hannnn: reversing 
 Hannnn: damn ya
 Hannnn: can't seem to see any idea coming from my mind
 jacek: oh my
 AntiSquid: try overclocking your brain Hannnn
 Uljahn: try to think outside the box like Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i can't find a good way to go
 Hannnn: shit i tried it out
 AntiSquid: add more cooling liquid
 AntiSquid: rub shoulders with thermal paste
 Mr-Rc: wtf guys
 Mr-Rc: f
 davilla: that's weird, I've never seen it say "new" on one of the puzzles
 davilla: awaiting your moderation or something like that
 Mr-Rc: yas
 Mr-Rc: same
 Louis.: salut
 Tiramon: why would 'it' (whatever that is) say "new"?
 fajrwajr: Hello. I'm new here.
 davilla: in Community &gt; Contributions
 davilla: I mean it makes sense, but it's the only one I've ever seen that said new
 davilla: it also says 50 clashes played, so ironically it may not be new
 Tiramon: still no idea what exactly you are talking about =)
 AntiSquid: doesn't show up for me either&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: Tiramon what have you been up to?
 Tiramon: changing job, doing some small projects to support game communities... so primarly wasting time&#160;;)
 ESMAKING: Have you guys heard of Esma?
 Tiramon: European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
 ESMAKING: No!! Its an operating system, that is way better than Windows AND has yatzy
 ESMAKING: What do you think about that?
 jacek: ponyos?
 Tiramon: even if i google for 'esma operating system' it doesn't show up ... can't be that awesome ..
 Illedan: You need to Bing it.
 jacek: or bang it
 Tiramon: if it is the space ship operating system ... i stoped reading after i've seen the font of that page ...
 Tiramon: it hurts ...
 ESMAKING: @Tiramon please stop being toxic, or i will have to report you 
 jacek: :scream:
 ESMAKING: Yea, you heard me
 Tiramon: sorry but neon green font on black background isn't a goot color choice..also Lato is not the font of my choice ...also having an opinion is not being toxic ... if i want to be toxic you would notice it&#160;;)
 Tiramon: *good
 Tiramon: oh and you don't need the @ infront of the name
 Tiramon: you asked and i answered ... if you don't want honest answers ... don't ask
 ESMAKING: Okay im very sorry
 Sandborg: Wait we talking about ESMA OS in here?
 AntiSquid: no advertising bullshit please @_@
 struct: o.o
 Sandborg: o.o
 Illedan: AntiSquid..
 Sandborg: I mean, that wasnt advertising tho
 Tiramon: don't think you the ban was needed, but i guess he won't be missed ...
 AntiSquid: ESMA KING
 Tiramon: -you
 AntiSquid: sure, all good right, like usernames: PRODUCTNAME_GUY with link and casually discussing PRODUCTNAME by pure chance
 AntiSquid: just a coincidence
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: ok
 Tiramon:&#160;:)
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 AntiSquid: and then the bullshit about being toxic
 Tiramon: got a bad day?
 Sandborg: Its literally a meme from his university haha, the fact that google didnt show anything related to a ESMA OS might have been a hint 
 Sandborg: :shrug:
 AntiSquid: google doesn't show a lot of info regarding scam in general
 AntiSquid: you won't find it all
 Uljahn: you won't find jacekmax either :thinking:
 Sandborg: True, but that was just a meme, its all good tho, have a nice day and gl in clashes @AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: i don't do clashes
 Sandborg: Then gl in whatever you do :thumbsup:
 Asunaa: guys, how can i put several exemples when i submit a reverse clash (contribution)&#160;?
 Tiramon: damn clash points decay much slower ... i still have some CP in clashs
 Sandborg: What's that?
 AntiSquid: idc, maybe i saved you from chinese spyware
 Tiramon: the points you earn by being active on the page and solving stuff in the compete part of the page
 AntiSquid: or danish :thinking:
 AntiSquid: there's some button saying add test case or something Asunaa
 Tiramon: you really believe i would download stuff like that ... i'm maybe bored ... but i'm not that desperate&#160;;)
 Sandborg: There is nothing to download 
 Sandborg: I dont think i earned any clash points yet
 Asunaa: AntiSquid well i have already 4 tests, but only the first one shows as an example
 AntiSquid: i delete such posts regardless, Tiramon
 AntiSquid: Asunaa maybe you need to click send or something to update the puzzle, there's some step you missed
 Tiramon: as i said he won't be missed&#160;:)i have no problem with you decision&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: i know it's not easy to see, but just go through it carefully
 Tiramon: but no back to 'usefull' stuff
 Tiramon: *now
 AntiSquid: ADD A TEST CASE button, after last validator, then scroll all the way down and click send and refresh the page ... i am not sure if TEST IN IDE would allow you to immediately check, but it should
 AntiSquid: Asunaa i see more than one example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57040ef9d73fbf30662196ce282f3316d2cf">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57040ef9d73fbf30662196ce282f3316d2cf</a>, both in IDE and on the contrib page
 AntiSquid: refresh
 AntiSquid: page
 AntiSquid: oh wait wrong one lol
 Asunaa: yep this one has 1 example has well
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/64925dee447769abe81361afcf45185c1337">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/64925dee447769abe81361afcf45185c1337</a>
 AntiSquid: idk ... what you're seeing
 Asunaa: this is mine
 Asunaa: x)
 AntiSquid: maybe some bug&#160;?
 AntiSquid: scroll down?
 Asunaa: i can see all tests
 AntiSquid: but you said you see only one @_@
 Asunaa: but that's not what i mean
 Asunaa: i talked about the "Example" row
 Tiramon: difference i see .. first test case hase an upercase T while the others are lowercase
 Asunaa: input, output, constraints, then example
 AntiSquid: oh
 Tiramon: maybe thats why it is only choosing first one ... but that would be some kind of strange
 AntiSquid: well 1 is starndard no? 
 Asunaa: that's why I asked if I could put more examples
 Asunaa: in that section
 AntiSquid: ah i missunderstood, my bad, thought you want more validators
 Asunaa: lol no 
 Tiramon: haven't played clash in some time .. not sure if more than one example is possible
 RoboStac: pretty sure reverse clashes show all test cases as examples when it's approved, but the contribution doesn't show you what it'll look like as reverse
 Tiramon: sounds reasonable
 Asunaa: oh ok
 Asunaa: thx robostac
 Asunaa: i think u're right
 Tiramon: damn minimalistic implementation doesn't beet the boss .. 
 struct: in which game?
 Tiramon: *beat
 Tiramon: i started Night of Warand first boss was even done with rand movement
 Tiramon: but the second needs atleast a 'don't enter tile where you can be attacked'
 jrke: not random its bugged intensionally
 Tiramon: so if i want to move on i guess i need to invest some brain/time into it&#160;;)

 Louis.: i think it likes bot programming on Codingame
 AntiSquid: who is Louis. and why are they following me?
 Wontonimo: he likes you , like a puppy following in the footsteps of his inter galactic spaceship flying cat ... wait, that makes no sense
 Wontonimo: spaceships don't leave footsteps
 2kpro: :joy:
 2kpro: i got my first legend achievement
 Wontonimo: oh, congrats 2kpro&#160;!  
 Wontonimo: That first one feels fantastic!

 Louis.: AntiSquid 
 Wontonimo: ^^ so mysterious
 Louis.: what do you mean Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: I like that you used "or" in stead of "and".  Makes it seems like only one of the statements is correct and we are left to ponder which one.  How did you find about about this site Louis.&#160;?
 pardouin: 2kpro I thought you meant legend league in some multi ^^
 pardouin: that would have been impressive after one month
 Wontonimo: Louis. I see you've done some clash of code, have you tried out any of the other challenges?  One that I like recommending is Mars Lander <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>

 pardouin: bonjouur
 AntiSquid: wasn't asking you
 AntiSquid: asking Louis.

 Louis.: ohh soory 
 2kpro: Hey AntiSquid i got my first legend achievment
 Louis.: sorry
 AntiSquid: for what?
 2kpro: all the lanquages
 Louis.: i am solving mars lander so i can't see what you say AntiSquid
 Louis.: salut or hi or hii or bonjour

 AntiSquid: yes
 Uljahn: invest over 10k hours
 Mil27Coder: ok
 Tiramon: first i was about to say 10k is probably to much, but yes 10k/8h per day /250working day per year = means around 5 years of working experience .. not that bad ...
 Mil27Coder: 1 million hours

 ZarthaxX: D:
 struct: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: ezpz
 ZarthaxX: is there one that involves playing many clashes?
 struct: let me check
 BlaiseEbuth: One ask you to be top1000
 ZarthaxX: thought there was, as westicle played 500
 Andrija385: did someone actually implement machine learning in these league bot games
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth kidding? god :P
 struct: nope you only need 50
 ZarthaxX: oh okey
 ZarthaxX: gud
 struct: 500 is for the achievement
 struct: not for questmap
 ZarthaxX: ahhh achievement
 BlaiseEbuth: Not kidding
 ZarthaxX: well, you still needed 500 for smth damn
 BlaiseEbuth: never
 struct: Yes there is one where you need top 10000
 struct: 1000*
 ZarthaxX: aight BlaiseEbuth you got me depressed :D
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 ZarthaxX: interesting
 struct: I think I got both at same time
 struct: top 1000 and 3 in a row
 ZarthaxX: the prodigy :P
 Andrija385: python is the best for clashes, correct me if im wrong

 Wontonimo: i wonder why i didn't hear about this.  sigh
 jacek: me too
 jacek: ~
 jacek: not that i would participate fully
 struct: Well usually I just spend the first few days optimizing and rewriting code
 struct: This time I cant do that
 struct: So its good for me
 Wontonimo: it doesn't have leagues that I can tell.  I'm guessing it doesn't effect your CP or rank
 struct: nah
 struct: its "private"
 Wontonimo: oh, during registration my country is suspiciously missing. lol
 struct: I think you are not eligible for prizes
 struct: Im not sure
 struct: I didnt read the rules
 Wontonimo: it looks like CSB and SR again, with maybe a bit of a twist
 davilla: I wish the leaderboard gave an indication of how much NN stuff was being used
 PatrickMcGinnisII: non-americas challenge
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i entered anyways as a UK
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no cp, no xp
 PatrickMcGinnisII: any1 below me on leaderboard isn't trying...i literally didn't do anything beyond the minimum
 Wontonimo: :D
 Wontonimo: ah, okay, so i registered ... do i have to wait for an email or something in order to enter the ide?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nope, just save the http
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cant search for it
 Wontonimo: ah ... got it.  the register button changes to 'start'. i'm so noob sometimes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the dynamics are a bit different, pods seem slower for some reason, less drift unless u boost, i didn't bother
 Wontonimo: CSB is 200 thrust, vs SLCC is 100 thrust, so 1/2 speed
 Wontonimo: CSB is 100 thrust for lower ranks I believe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, amkes sense...i didn't spend ANY time with it
 Wontonimo: the write up for SLCC has less info than CSB, but it looks like the same rules other than there is no limit on turning.  turn as much as you like
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, if i remember right they left the .85 friction in
 PatrickMcGinnisII: added a player
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pretty basic
 ErrorRazor: The biggest mechanical difference is that in csb you can only turn 18 degrees per turn, it's unlimited in slcc
 ErrorRazor: Oh you already said that. Sorry I'm tired af
 Andrija385: int v=min(100,d/(1+abs(a))/10);
 Andrija385: this is my function for the velocity in CSB
 Andrija385: v is velocity
 Andrija385: d is distance to checkpoint
 Andrija385: a is the angle
 jacek: where do you get angle
 Andrija385: angle can be used in higher leagues
 jacek: not in slcc eh
 Andrija385: what is slcc
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge</a>
 Andrija385: which games are played in that challenge
 Andrija385: if you are still here
 jacek: csb derivative
 Wontonimo: so what's weird is that the next checkpoint you are provided is not YOUR next checkpoint, but the leaders next checkpoint.
 Andrija385: if he is ahead of you
 Andrija385: you can store his checkpoints in a list
 Andrija385: and use them
 Wontonimo: you've got to calculate your next checkpoint 
 Andrija385: but if you are ahead
 Andrija385: you are screwed
 Andrija385: how do you calculate your next checkpoint
 Wontonimo: you know the xy of each checkpoint and your xy ... calculate if you hit
 ErrorRazor: You're given every pod's checkpoint id
 Wontonimo: OH ... Right
 Wontonimo: i'm dumb
 ErrorRazor: Same
 Andrija385: but you dont know the order in which you should visit them?
 Wontonimo: yes, from 0 to N-1 then back to 0
 Wontonimo: no ... that's not right
 Wontonimo: i don't know
 Andrija385: so what's weird is that the next checkpoint you are provided is not YOUR next checkpoint, but the leaders next checkpoint.
 ErrorRazor: We're talking about two different games, gets confusing
 Andrija385: someone said this
 PatrickMcGinnisII: every pod's next cp is given
 Jon12: Hi!
 Andrija385: I am struggling with boss4 in CSB
 PatrickMcGinnisII: silver, gold?
 Andrija385: bronze
 Andrija385: i am using this formula for velocity
 Andrija385: int v=min(100,d/(1+abs(a))/5);
 Andrija385: d is distance
 Andrija385: a is angle

 Andrija385: and this logic for the boost
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think you don't wanna vary thrust as much as you are
 Mikeycoder: im getting better and i think the tip i would give is look at angles more than thrust and adjusting 
 Andrija385: can we duel somehow??
 Mikeycoder: for sharp or wide angles with thrust
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you are within 18 degrees of pointing at destination, max thrust is preferred.  If you can drift thru at 0 thrust and change direction to next cp, it's mre efficident
 Andrija385: Is there an option where I can invite you in a race
 Mikeycoder: also look at what happens when enemy bumps in to you
 Mikeycoder: what would you do if a car was coming towards you
 ErrorRazor: Andrija385 you can change your opponent, click "delete" under the bot and add whoever you want
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you aren't within 1000 ranks of me, i can't add u asa opponent
 Wontonimo: I see what you mean PatrickMcGinnisII , I just submitted the p-3*v classic CSB control and already at around 45th in SLCC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: get up to rank 1440, and i can play aginst you Andrija385
 Andrija385: ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo yea, i settled at 57th with same
 Andrija385: It would be nice if i knew how to implement some sort of a machine learning algorithm
 Wontonimo: what do you mean?
 Andrija385: neural network
 Wontonimo: for what purpose&#160;?  for CSB?
 jacek: :eyes:
 Andrija385: yes
 Andrija385: for any game
 Wontonimo: have you written a simulator yet?
 Andrija385: no i didnt
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo you boost on first turn, lol competition in Sofia isn't heavy in competition
 Mikeycoder: woohoo im up to 700 lol not sure im gonna get to the boss this round thought&#160;:(
 Andrija385: where are you from guys
 Mikeycoder: england
 Wontonimo: Andrija385 , so without a simulation of the game (or able to play the game itself a lot) it is very hard to do ML
 Andrija385: yeah i know
 Wontonimo: so, step 1 is either write a simulation of the game, or get one
 Andrija385: is there a way to speed up playing against bot
 Wontonimo: you can get one by downloading the referee in many of the games
 Andrija385: instead of watching the game, i could get the results straight away
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hit settings gear Andrija385
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or ff tot he end
 Wontonimo: that's one way, but for NN you'll need way more feedback than just  by using the online IDE
 Mikeycoder: i still got work to do dropped tp 1018 now
 Andrija385: int v=min(100,d/(1+abs(a)));
 Andrija385: im beating the boss with this formula for velocity
 Andrija385: i mean thrust
 Andrija385: d(distance), a(angle)
 Mikeycoder: interesting
 Andrija385: but in arena
 Andrija385: i am not so good
 Mikeycoder: have you controled your angles or anything
 Andrija385: 17000th after 30 games
 Mikeycoder: with if statements
 Andrija385: the formula does that
 Andrija385: when the angle is big
 Andrija385: velocity is low and vice versa
 Mikeycoder: oh ok maths not a strong poitn of mine
 Andrija385: same for the distance
 Mikeycoder: thats pretty cool
 Andrija385: if the distance is big
 Andrija385: high thrust
 Andrija385: yeah its very compact
 Andrija385: but not very effective
 Andrija385: im 20000th right now
 Mikeycoder: have you checked what maps you struggle on
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if a&lt;18 drop it to 0 and let nx,ny do the adjustment for you
 Mikeycoder: is it close ones or wide open ones
 Andrija385: patrick you meant to 100??
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so the divide ends up /1
 Andrija385: yeah but then it rushes through the checkpoint
 Andrija385: and takes a lot of time to get back on track
 iwantcakenow21: Gilbert moment
 Astrobytes: think about how to prevent that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well if a&lt;18, calculate the turns to intercept
 PatrickMcGinnisII: d/spd
 Andrija385: if(abs(a)&lt;15&amp;&amp;d&gt;4000&amp;&amp;!used)
 Andrija385: is this a good logic for the boost
 Mikeycoder: mines abit longer than that and diferent values
 Mikeycoder: but its along the same lines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i find the longest distance between cp
 Mikeycoder: yours is more compact
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and us it there, otherwise do it first turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: use
 Andrija385: i am rank 7000 bronze league
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can boost,shield, and bust your enemy off the path
 Andrija385: can i play some of you guys
 Mikeycoder: im so close just got to find a little more performance&#160;:)
 Mikeycoder: think were to high up the ranks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smits wrote a csb break down
 Mikeycoder: yea im 1998 now bronze
 Astrobytes: I think Smitsimax might be a bit overkill for now Patrick&#160;;)
 Scarfield: SmitstroBytes
 Astrobytes: SmitsiField
 Andrija385: are there any youtubers streaming these games?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why is CSB so popular, not my fav.
 Astrobytes: Mikeycoder, Andrija385: don't overthink it is the advice I'll give you. Think about getting through the checkpoints as fast as possible.
 Scarfield: joining slcc astro?
 Astrobytes: Not sure Scarfo, not particularly motivated tbh
 Wontonimo: oh Astrobytes, write a p-3*v bot at least
 Wontonimo: if anything , just to populate the board with some opponents for others
 Astrobytes: lol, I could do a lot more than that - can I be bothered is the question 
 Astrobytes: Fair point Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: it'll take you 10 mins or less
 Scarfield: its pretty cool imo, and easy enough to change up csb bot
 Andrija385: what is p-3*v
 Wontonimo: p = positional targetv = velocity
 PatrickMcGinnisII: astro at least you r in one of the right countries for sofia
 Astrobytes: I didn't even look at the terms tbh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i only did the nx=x-(vx*3) thing, any1 below me in sofia is unemployable...oops...rofl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek just submitted
 Scarfield: currently below you :thinking:
 Wontonimo: PatrickMcGinnisII hey now, don't get rid of my junior devs who only know CSS, cuz then I'd have to do the CSS 
 Astrobytes: A grim job indeed,
 PatrickMcGinnisII: xml sucks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: agreed... grim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: christmas tree puzzle is kicking my arse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: even tho i know the math
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 orangesnowfox: ... How absurd would it be to run a cpp bot through bash for faster code? 
 orangesnowfox: ... Probably takes too long to compile
 Mikeycoder: this is fun site 
 inoryy: you can just compile how you want and b85 encode the binary

 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf, Lost my will to live.  Tenant totally left one of rental houses traashed
 Astrobytes: Aw nasty PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so many asshats in the world
 orangesnowfox: inoryy... That binary wouldn't fit in the editor
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gonna take me weeks to fix, no more daytime coding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so, glhf

 orangesnowfox: "Flagged as a cheat during contests since Wondev Woman"
 orangesnowfox: ah, right, because they need to see your source
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's fine for all other purposes.
 Astrobytes: see "multiplayer is a zoo" comment on the forum somewhere
 derjack: oh my
 Wontonimo: ah, sorry to hear PatrickMcGinnisII.  I've had a nasty tenant once.  was horrible
 jacek: woah im 47
 GilbertGaming27: Gilbert
 Wontonimo: you beat me jacek.  i guess I'm writing CSS for you 
 jacek: GilbertGaming27 are you pokemon
 Yibbuf: a
 inoryy: orangesnowfox as Astrobytes wrote it's perfmitted in multiplayer and most definitely works
 orangesnowfox: TIL, I wonder how much that matters for languages like cpp where we have pragma anyway...
 orangesnowfox: Probably a bit
 inoryy: last time I did something seriously it marginally improved things for me, but that was &gt; 2 years ago
 jacek: how can it improve? unless you can pack more weights this way
 Astrobytes: Offline compilation, just execute the binary. Again, it's moot whether this makes a difference currently.
 inoryy: When I used it CG was still funky with the -O3 flag compilation. Things might have changed now.
 Astrobytes: Still no O3 but I think the pragmas are sufficient
 jacek: Ofast works&#160;:?
 inoryy: Yeah I mean the pragmas didn't cover everything back then. Some STL parts were left unoptimized.
 Astrobytes: No we have O3 and Ofast in pragmas, not as a compilation flag on CG's end jacek
 Astrobytes: inoryy: yeah, as long as you're careful (not resizing vectors etc, keeping things contiguous) things are OK
 2berk1: It was x*(x+y) lol
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 inoryy: Still worth testing I suppose, especially once the bot is in a "final" stage.
 Astrobytes: For sure
 struct: Just dont pre optimize
 struct: Like me
 Astrobytes: Not again, surely struct!
 struct: nah
 struct: Unless you count doing it using avx
 Astrobytes: You were doing that anyway, so that's just a modification right
 struct: Yeah mostly
 struct: But Ill rewrite it
 Astrobytes: Plenty time left

 ZarthaxX: that translator took some time
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Astrobytes: I needed the accents and shit
 struct: Spanish use&#160;! at begining and end&#160;!?
 ZarthaxX: no accents there
 ZarthaxX: yes struct
 ZarthaxX: normally no one uses the ¡
 Astrobytes: Funny wiggly things and strange punctuation
 ZarthaxX: so you detect a translator right there :D
 Astrobytes: Or a linguistic website
 ZarthaxX: or that
 ZarthaxX: Astruistic
 Astrobytes: It's very formal
 ZarthaxX: ok sounds like autistic
 ZarthaxX: mmhm
 ZarthaxX: spanish sucks
 ZarthaxX: gotta love englando :D
 Astrobytes: I suck at Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Hey, it's on The List

 Marchete: spanish have ¿? and ¡!
 Marchete: because our sentences aren't the same than English
 Astrobytes: More or less yeah struct

 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a grammatical difference.And yes
 Marchete: Estás seguro -&gt; You are sure
 Marchete: ¿Estás seguro? -&gt; Are you sure?

 Ivan8or: you're ugly
 ZarthaxX: i know that, thanks
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 Ivan8or: look at that stinky hat
 Ivan8or: stinky
 ZarthaxX: damn
 Ivan8or: yeah i said it
 Astrobytes: This went south real fast
 ZarthaxX: didnt like the fox pirate hehe
 ZarthaxX: yeah it did lol
 ZarthaxX: pirate fox*
 struct: brazilian is kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
 Astrobytes: yes
 ZarthaxX: the jajaja one relates to the real laugh here i guess
 ZarthaxX: but the kkkk one does too?= lol
 Astrobytes: After working with hordes of them, living with them and socialising with them I still do not know why
 Astrobytes: (brazilians that is)
 ZarthaxX: working?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, when I was head chef at a restaurant in South London most of my staff were br
 Astrobytes: Front and back of house
 ZarthaxX: you were chef :O
 Astrobytes: Also when I lived with them.
 ZarthaxX: nice
 ZarthaxX: not a pleasable experience? :c
 Astrobytes: Yeah, me and squiddy are the two ex-chefs on here
 Astrobytes: Haha, living with br folks was... exhausting! Soooo much partying :D
 Illedan: Worked as a part time chef for 2 years too.
 Astrobytes: Yay, 3 of us.
 Illedan: Apes strong together!

 Nagna_Script: anyone wanna trade arabian kohl for eyeliners and hair product industry .... it's a good deal i have 
 Nagna_Script: u could just find your clients and i'm your provider 
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: Hahaha they really, really, really do! Great fun though, and great people 
 Illedan: Please don't advertise Nagna_Script
 Astrobytes: Nagna_Script: Errrrr, no. Stop.
 ZarthaxX: that's what matters :P
 Nagna_Script: ok ok sorry but i wasn't i don't have companny 
 Nagna_Script: i'm free dealer 
 Astrobytes: It's still advertising.
 Nagna_Script: hmmmm technichally no 
 ARRG: Hi folks. I'm trying to use the stub generator for a problem I'm writing. The first line is an integer N so I tried "read n:int" but in the Java template this produces int n = in.nextInt(); and doesn't consume the newline. .Does anyone know hot to write the stub in a way that the newline would be consumed?
 Astrobytes: You are advertising your trade. You are a trader.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my gf didn't appreciate google translate
 Illedan: Keep it code or fun related in this chat&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Pon tu culito en mis manos
 Illedan: ARRG did you check the docs?
 Nagna_Script: it's just wining friends that r motivated to jump and swim after each opportunity 
 ARRG: The pop up on the right yeah, didn't find anything about that. Is there a more complete one?
 AntiSquid: Nagna_Script if i wouldn't have to argue with these guys afterwards i would instant ban you right now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: c'mon ZarthaxX give my the argentinian panty fropper line
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er dropper
 Nagna_Script: no u cant' sir cuz i stopped advertizing and i have a debate right now 
 struct: Why do you want it to be consumed ARRG?
 Astrobytes: I'm kicking already AntiSquid
 Nagna_Script: bypassed ur kick 
 Astrobytes: Behave.
 Nagna_Script: cm oooooooooooooooooon
 ARRG: My complete input is something like "3\na b c" so without consuming the newline people will have to do extra work to get correct input
 ARRG: I think I've seen the template behave correctly in other problems so I think it can be done, I just don't know how

 ZarthaxX: PatrickMcGinnisII what line? lol
 Marchete: yours ZarthaxX
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i need the magic argentinian pickup line
 Marchete: your line
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or brazilian or spanish, I'm open
 ZarthaxX: idk what line
 AntiSquid: missunderstood then, on a sidenote i am selling geniune snake oil, Automaton2000 would you like some?
 ZarthaxX: a phrase?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: to pickup the women
 Automaton2000: i like to see how they did it for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :P
 ZarthaxX: the f :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: the only known phrase i know is the "che"
 ZarthaxX: lol
 struct: I doubt you would be able to spell a sentence 
 struct: I see people struggling with even the most common name
 ZarthaxX: wot
 struct: Foreign people cant spell "João"
 struct: At least most of them
 AntiSquid: PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;: "donde eres tu mujer, tu muy bella"
 AntiSquid: pick up line lol
 Astrobytes: Unless you know about these things struct it's totally alien
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Anti-magic,&#160;;)
 ARRG: @struct thanks that helped. Turns out the stub was correct I just misunderstood how Java's scanner handles newlines
 AntiSquid: idk, either they like you or they don't, any pick up line should work, tonedeaf ones are more fun regardless if you get rejected 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: more like "Te verías hermosa en mi cama"
 Astrobytes: ARRG: Awesome. Another reason to blame Java for something. I approve :P
 AntiSquid: i mean imagine girls would try to do a pickup line on you, does it matter what they use? either you like the gril or you don't
 WesCraterMadman: ^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sorry, my GF is an English teacher ... I need some rico suave stuff now
 ZarthaxX: lol
 AntiSquid: doesn't she prefer english over foreign language then&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Who the hell actually uses pickup lines?
 N-ONE: hey there , may you help&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: i dont lol
 ZarthaxX: i was lucky
 ZarthaxX: :D
 AntiSquid: seems common in american TV shows / movies Astrobytes

 Astrobytes: (I know you know that)
 ZarthaxX: shh Astrobytes dont ruin his life
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've got to keep her on her toes.
 AntiSquid: well in here in UK i heard about pick up lines in pubs, but people were doing it jokingly, coming up with really weird shit
 Astrobytes: Tie her up PatrickMcGinnisII! :D
 N-ONE: guys 
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: It's mostly jokes
 AntiSquid: N-ONE join the conversation it's far more important
 N-ONE: what are u talking about&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hey i did that puzzle
 N-ONE: yes i know ,, i am following you &gt;:D
 Astrobytes: N-ONE: don't worry. Describe the issue you're having
 AntiSquid: piquing the interest of a potential soul mate or temp partner N-ONE
 WesCraterMadman: pickup lines are one of those things that exist to be a joke. I've only ever seen them used irl to make fun of them, which can work as an icebreaker
 PatrickMcGinnisII: none, setup an array like {'Jan'=&gt;0.. etc.
 N-ONE: we can talk about the importance of CS degree&#160;?
 N-ONE: i used a dict 
 Astrobytes: Yes WesCraterMadman
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do a base convert
 N-ONE: of the index&#160;?
 AntiSquid: WesCraterMadman well ya but if they are funny you feel less bad if it goes wrong, easy to get over it lol
 AntiSquid: easier *
 N-ONE: i am having a quiz tomorrow on software engineering lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dunno what lang u doin., but the puzzle is pretty straight forward
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: The secret is to talk
 N-ONE: i used python ,,, probably i am getting it wrong lol 
 AntiSquid: and you can easier engage in a conversation with a joke
 AntiSquid: dunno why i am continuing this topic lol ... i am fine with my wife
 WesCraterMadman: lol
 N-ONE: should i add all the indices&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, base_convert the index, add them up... string split the sum, lookthem up and output
 Astrobytes: that's what WesCraterMadman meant by the icebreaker part AntiSquid
 N-ONE: hmmm ,, split the sum on what&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i remember with my wife she was just telling me off when the joke was bad ... didn't seem to mind much so it's that "either she likes you or she doesnt"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the sum is in base 12
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and prolly an int or a long
 PatrickMcGinnisII: get the string equivalent
 N-ONE: yes it's long ,,, but i don't get it 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lookup each digit..ie.  0 is January
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so 12 is JanFeb
 Astrobytes: Yes AntiSquid: "either she likes you or she doesn't" - but sometimes you have to compete with others
 TestDS: Guys, how can i challenge a friend in coders of the caribbeans?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er FebMar
 N-ONE: suppose the long is&#160;: 323401
 Astrobytes: TestDS: They must be in the same league or lower than you iirc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on lang, i just split it as a string into {3,2,3,4,0,1} and then used a lookup and joined the result
 N-ONE: oh i see 
 TestDS: We are in the same league, but we cant challenge each other
 N-ONE: so each num is a month after conv to base 12
 Astrobytes: Replace the default AI/Boss with their bot (use Settings
 Astrobytes: don't worry about the settings
 N-ONE: lol and i was wonder why the heck it's called base12 lol
 Astrobytes: Just replace  the opponent with your friend
 Astrobytes: TestDS: It means you can play IDE matches against each other, but to really challenge meaningfully you both have to compete in the leaderboard 
 TestDS: I can't find this option in the settings
 TestDS: Ok, I found it
 TestDS: thank you so much MAAN
 Astrobytes: No problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no wonder i couldn't get her to come over, she's the night time dean tonight
 Astrobytes: Dean Martin? :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: No soy suave
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: A dean is usually the head of a significant collection of departments within a college... damn u made me google
 OneToothMan: does the 1v1 code tester actually render for anyone?
 Astrobytes: I know what a dean is!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: her job is severely getting in the way of ... things
 Astrobytes: OneToothMan: Please state the nature of your coding emergency
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i recommend pizza and mountain dew
 Astrobytes: I prefer beer with pizza tbh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't stare at a screen on alcohol...just sayin'
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, away from the screen I mean
 Astrobytes: Otherwise it'd be coffee in between pizzas
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Mountain Dew eats your teeth OneToothMan
 Astrobytes: You wanna stick to the rare ol' mountain dew
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that sounds dirty
 Astrobytes: Irish moonshine, so potentially :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i live in&#160;: " Hold my beer, watch this" territory

 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's a bug in my house, one of my cats is going crazy hunting it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, putting my cat in charge of CG
 Astrobytes: My 2 are always going nuts, we have a lot of clothes moths in the UK these days, so they're never bored at least.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: If house cats were bigger, they would murder everyone
 Astrobytes: I agree 100%
 solution.cpp: caracals are bigger house cats
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you don't want those as pets
 solution.cpp: people keep them as pets actually
 Astrobytes: I know, it's not right
 Astrobytes: (imo)
 Astrobytes: They get declawed and whatnot
 Astrobytes: I mean I'm not gonna keep any wild cat. There's a reason we have the domesticated ones, and even they practically own us&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i found a new term: 'murder mittens'
 Astrobytes: That sounds like what I should have called the cat in my avatar
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's a whole line of murder mitten stickers
 Astrobytes: Actually, having looked it up, my black cat should have this title
 JSboss: crazy it's already been over a year since the tiger king fad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i refused to watch it
 Astrobytes: Never did get it. Made a point of not watching it tbh.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Big Cat Rescue is close to me, didn't wanna see the BS
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need a black cat now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: call him MM for short
 Astrobytes: Nah. Murder Mittens all the way. Imagine shouting him for his food in the garden :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, reddit is full of MM pics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I gotta stop surfing and find my bug
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you might end up with a Milf with mittens
 Astrobytes: Yes. Always remember rule 34
 Yibbuf: :snake:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg 
 Illedan: gn
 Astrobytes: gn Illedan
 Illedan: Be nice to my bot while I sleep
 Astrobytes: No danger from me lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: be nice Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i want to try to solve it
 solution.cpp: Say something inspiring Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i could probably do it in c#
 Astrobytes: gn all
 solution.cpp: gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sleep tight, murder mittens will be watching
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tuck him in Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: my bot is a lot more complicated than what i had in mind
 JSboss: Is COC broken for anyone else? Mine lets me enter the lobby but never sends me into the clash, then shows an error. Already cleared all local settings, cache etc.
 hhhhhhhhhhhh: yeah, it was stuck, i reloaded the page and was able to clash
 MajorH5: fixes after reload
 JSboss: Thx this time it worked
 solution.cpp: Site seems to be glitchy rn
 MajorH5: yeah site is dying. something is going on with the websocket?
 DaNinja: happens daily at this time, takes about 30 minutes for some processing
 MajorH5: erid go to know
 MajorH5: weird*
 MajorH5: i cant spell&#160;:(
 botnation: f
 botnation: sad
 solution.cpp: i really just won a CoC in fastest mode with a solution at 14 minutes in lol
 ZarthaxX: everyone is afk
 ZarthaxX: including myself
 struct: no
 ZarthaxX: struct yes
 ZarthaxX: im just getting clash count
 struct: time to stop you&#160;:)
 struct: shortest, you got unlucky ZarthaxX
 struct: ZarthaxX are you on winning streak?
 struct: or fighting for rank1000?
 IJustKilledYouV2: i guess this site is not for learning how to code, i just cant solve anything on my own
 struct: Yeah, its not really meant for begginers
 IJustKilledYouV2: well any tips where should i learn&#160;?
 octopuscabbage: read a book on coding
 IJustKilledYouV2: i am begginer, but i know what is int and stuff
 struct: I see some people mentioning codeacademy sometimes
 struct: I never tried it though
 octopuscabbage: ZarthaxX i will get u 
 struct: I dont know where ZarthaxX went, I finished clash though
 IJustKilledYouV2: codeacademy just trying to take my money :D
 struct: it isnt free?
 struct: Which language do you want to learn?
 IJustKilledYouV2: well c++, but i have some basics in python
 IJustKilledYouV2: wait looks like it works tho it says "pro_"
 octopuscabbage: do people stream clash of code?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.learncpp.com/">https://www.learncpp.com/</a>
 Andriamanitra: @octopuscabbage yes, not usually at this time of day though
 octopuscabbage: @Adianmanitra ty i was considering streaming it myself
 IJustKilledYouV2: i know this site, but im just searching how to make it less boring
 octopuscabbage: for the big competitions are like pre written simulators for the turns 
 ShortBaited: anyone has a shorter way for this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://51.38.126.162:7777/xeqovogesa.pl">http://51.38.126.162:7777/xeqovogesa.pl</a>
 orangesnowfox: ShortBaited, code golf?
 octopuscabbage: cuz i wanna work on solving the problem not just simulating the game
 ShortBaited: orangesnowfox yes
 orangesnowfox: ShortBaited, well... You're using whitespace, for one
 ShortBaited: yeah cause python regex
 ShortBaited: idunno why hastebin thinks that my python code is perl O.o
 orangesnowfox: extension?
 ShortBaited: what extension?
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://51.38.126.162:7777/xeqovogesa.pl">http://51.38.126.162:7777/xeqovogesa.pl</a> "pl"
 ShortBaited: its generated as file to save it
 ShortBaited: and .pl = perl
 orangesnowfox: ah
 ShortBaited: but my code is in python
 orangesnowfox: yeah
 ShortBaited: thats what is confusing me xD
 orangesnowfox: anyway, some easy stuff you could do is: use `1` instead of True, use only a single print statement, use `and, or` instead of `if, else`
 ShortBaited: Okey thanks i will try it
 orangesnowfox: Try looking at the stack overflow tips
 ShortBaited: ido get an error if id do and or in print at 04 case&#160;:(
 Andriamanitra: r="input().split()" and eval(r) is probably shorter than what you're doing to read input
 ShortBaited: okey
 Andriamanitra: D[0]=="R" is one character shorter than D=="RIGHT"
 Andriamanitra: as far as i can see you're not using either M or N so you can do *_ instead of them
 ShortBaited: omg your a genius lol
 orangesnowfox: bonus tip: there are 3 possible strings, look at the first letter of each (you can use `&gt;` / `&lt;` instead of `==`)
 Andriamanitra: for Q in H*"x" is also one character shorter than for Q in range(H) since you're not using Q for anything
 orangesnowfox: yep
 Wontonimo: is it "orange snow fox" or "oranges now fox"&#160;?  I must know
 ShortBaited: xD
 Wontonimo: sorry, i've been drinking
 BigFatDecker: hi im trying to implement the minimax algorithum but everytime i try to run it i get a time out can someone help me please. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/iJFA1k2j">https://pastebin.com/iJFA1k2j</a>
 BigFatDecker: its for the connect 4 exercise
 ShortBaited: urgh pastebin
 BigFatDecker: is it not working?
 TinyWhale: anyone else having weird issues like page won't update or redirect after clash of code timer runs down? It was working fine yesterday
 struct: I had that issue
 struct: try refreshing the page
 struct: of the clash of code you were in
 ShortBaited: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65afb413-3211-42b5-9217-819a4a75ce33">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65afb413-3211-42b5-9217-819a4a75ce33</a>
 ShortBaited: that what i have rn
 ShortBaited: but i get error at 4 case 
 ShortBaited: if ido it with if else it works fine 
 TinyWhale: yea refreshing manually seems to fix it but I have to do it every time&#160;:/ Seems like there some connection issue whenever a updated is requested <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/3jwN7m4">https://imgur.com/a/3jwN7m4</a> oh well. Thanks struct
 BigFatDecker: board_row = input()  # one row of the board (from top to bottom) could i put a 7 in between  the input parenthesis to show if there is 7 to move onto the next row?
 struct: I will report it TinyWhale, can I put that picture on discord?
 MadKnight: wow that's a weird error TinyWhale
 TinyWhale: will do
 MadKnight: TinyWhale are u new here? i feel like i remember your nick
 TinyWhale: yea pretty new
 TinyWhale: I may have used this nickname elsewhere tho. so that may be why
 MadKnight: no i mean like i remember it from here
 MadKnight: maybe it was just some other Whale
 MadKnight: anyway
 MadKnight: have u tried bot programming mode&#160;?
 TinyWhale: yea seems to work fine
 solution.cpp: nice one harryPotter. im happy with second place there
 Qyxi: Evening folks.

 ShortBaited: huh
 ShortBaited: didnt ment send this link like this 
 ShortBaited: so is here anyone whos a little more in kinda python stuff?
 Qyxi: I'm fairly new around here, poking buttons, making a mess at attempting this code thing. It's an interesting system.
 Qyxi: I tried the clash of code thing, 5-10 times or so. Never finished one, always run out of time.
 MadKnight: did u like it TinyWhale&#160;?
 BigFatDecker: why is this causing me to timeout if(turn_index &gt; int(input('6'))):?
 MadKnight: because u can't get a random value with input and it always only gives the next one&#160;?
 MadKnight: which means u always compare it to different input values&#160;?
 MadKnight: calm down Automaton2000 he might just be a newbie
 Automaton2000: u can get a good rank
 BigFatDecker: im so confused i cant figure out another way to check if the row is full and if it is move to the next row
 MadKnight: u have to put the value into a variable
 MadKnight: input only gives u the next input line
 MadKnight: u can't get an input by id
 MadKnight: unless it's a game with turns
 MadKnight: where u have a while True:
 MadKnight: BigFatDecker what puzzle is that&#160;?
 BigFatDecker: its connect 4 wood league 2
 ShortBaited: which one
 ShortBaited: there are more then 1 leauges
 BigFatDecker: it says there is opnly wood league
 ShortBaited: look at the url and say what it is
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/connect-4</a>
 BigFatDecker: does that bring u there?
 ShortBaited: yeah it does
 BigFatDecker: ok so i got this to work if(turn_index&gt;7):
 BigFatDecker: but how could i add one to the print(1) each time it fills up with 7
 BigFatDecker: ok nevermind i changed it to this  if(turn_index&gt;8): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c796fa39-2a66-40c6-9202-354d03bf8133">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c796fa39-2a66-40c6-9202-354d03bf8133</a>
 BigFatDecker: if(turn_index&gt;8): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5bdcfe5-7cf7-4b97-8a4f-5617ed64d533">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5bdcfe5-7cf7-4b97-8a4f-5617ed64d533</a>
 Qyxi: a variable?
 BigFatDecker: yes lol
 BigFatDecker: so i made x = 1 then i have it just printing x plus one and the works
 Qyxi: I mean, print(1) is fixed. Wouldn't you need to print(varState)?
 ShortBaited: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 ShortBaited: WTF?
 Qyxi: I'm not suggesting, i'm asking. I've solved like 5 puzzles, and they were hard for me, even though they say easy. *shrugs* Just trying to understand I suppose.
 Qyxi: Is that a thing ShortBaited? Or was it too many simultaneous plays, or to many play attempts in a short span of time?
 ShortBaited: idunno what the site want from me but its already fixed O.o
 ShortBaited: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5201b531-7bcd-4073-8479-5d556c84980b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5201b531-7bcd-4073-8479-5d556c84980b</a>
 Qyxi: I'm curious how GA's are trained on those games. There a download/source of the game(s) to train on? Do you train in real time on the game on the site? By turn? By win? Seems like it would be difficult to design a useful fitness function per turn, since a good turn could still cause/lead to a loss.
 ZarthaxX: Qyxi some years ago ppl used GA as their search algorithm
 ZarthaxX: myself included
 ZarthaxX: worked pretty cool..
 nitekat: does anyone has slow response issue right now?
 Qyxi: I read an article about it involving the 2 ships. But, I was unclear how they was training. I was left with the impression that they was training 6-7 potentials each turn.
 brandex123: @nitekat, yeah i tought it was just me
 brandex123: i have to refresh the site everymoment
 nitekat: :disappointed:
 Stormalix: oof same
 ZarthaxX: yeah dying for me too
 ShortBaited: site is kinda dying rn
 ShortBaited: cannot even start the clash
 ShortBaited: it says its already started
 MajorH5: i cant play like this im getting off
 MajorH5: goodnight or morning where ever you are&#160;:)
 ShortBaited: its 6am in germany so good morning xD
 MajorH5: 11:50 PM
 ShortBaited: good night you and good sleep
 Papyrus_HB: Good mornign
 brandex123: olv
 DrQuarius: mm site is dying. "Duplicate tab" if your clash lags when you try to start it. The new tab will work, I find
 DrQuarius: This time of day = lag
 ShortBaited: i quit for now

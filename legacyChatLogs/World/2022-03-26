 Sarstan: Oh geez, just used my first dictionary. I think this is the tool I've been needing.
 Sarstan: And I used it wrong for what I needed because I didn't read where the input is coming from, lol. But awesome to finally put it into practice.
 Kaelidian: Loooooool
 Ajaiy: Does anyone know some official medium puzzles to continue with? I have already finished: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6577ec4a-f262-43cf-bd61-e1be785e5747">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6577ec4a-f262-43cf-bd61-e1be785e5747</a>

 Blokops: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-grand-festival---i">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-grand-festival---i</a>
 Blokops: skip part 2, is just part 1 with extra fluff (also is a pain to do in java)
 Synergyforge: I'm stuck on there is no spoon episode 1&#160;:(
 Ajaiy: Aww
 Ajaiy: Which part in it, though?
 Synergyforge: Trying to figure out how to find the next un-empty node in the current column
 Ajaiy: which lang?
 Synergyforge: down rows
 Synergyforge: Python
 Blokops: you can do a psudo linked list
 Blokops: to connect one node to the other
 Blokops: so like the index in a list equals the node and inside that index points to which node is connected
 Blokops: [[2,5,6],[5,7,0][1,2,3]
 Synergyforge: hmm
 Ajaiy: For example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/618cc520-bfa5-4dd2-9a53-3a064d480bf5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/618cc520-bfa5-4dd2-9a53-3a064d480bf5</a>
 Ajaiy: My code was pretty messy, with 76 lines
 Blokops: WORKING AT 1AM BE LIKE
 Dren: heh it's already 7 here
 Dren: though I usally work 18:45 - 7:15
 zhangqianxu: do anyone know how  to finish mad pod racing second game?
 jacek: happy Caturday
 dbdr: \o
 RahulRathod: Hello guys
 eulerscheZahl: 6h optim contest just started in case anyone cares (i won't play)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/ahc009/tasks/ahc009_a">https://atcoder.jp/contests/ahc009/tasks/ahc009_a</a>
 eulerscheZahl: looks like an interesting task actually. i just don't like the timing, doesn't fit in my calendar
 dbdr: DRDR
 dbdr: it's almost for me&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: get married and take her last name
 dbdr: 4 hours might be a bit short for that
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, 240min is 4h and not 6
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still in topcoder post-contest mode. need more time to recover
 eulerscheZahl: and CG contest around the corner
 janamejayjoshi: yo
 janamejayjoshi: bois
 inoryy: any info on what kind of contest it will be?
 eulerscheZahl: multiplayer
 eulerscheZahl: even says so in the announcement, if you read (really) carefully. I had to check 2 or 3 times too despite knowing it beforehand
 eulerscheZahl: What type of coding exercise should I expect?This is a bot programming (AI) challenge. New in bot programming? No worries, here's a guide for beginners.
 eulerscheZahl: just the "Major Community Event" part overshadowing the important things
 inoryy: nice
 inoryy: haha why is CSB called "mad pod racing"
 eulerscheZahl: because they are concerned about possible copyright infringements
 eulerscheZahl: not only CSB
 inoryy: huh, what would CSB infringe on?
 eulerscheZahl: empire strikes back
 eulerscheZahl: i had to ask too
 eulerscheZahl: they still have a few things left that they want to rename (or at least wanted)
 inoryy: wow that would be a stretch
 eulerscheZahl: game of drones. i suggested "drone wars"
 inoryy: lol
 inoryy: I guess it's a better safe than sorry kind of situation
 eulerscheZahl: probably related to the coderpad aquisition
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot a "c" somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: and that's not my only typo
 eulerscheZahl: or is it?

 dimp: In Bot Programming My Ranking is 1st/1,855 in Silver League. In the Leaderboards I am better than the Boss. It's been several hours. Why I not get promoted to the next league?
 Westicles: They have a timer so the cheaters will get bored and leave
 dimp: yeah, 2 timers have already passed
 Westicles: oh, then maybe a bug
 Uljahn: you may try to resubmit or ask [CG]Thibaud to promote you manually when he is online
 dimp: Ok. Thanks
 LoHoB: Hey guys, if I was working on a test related to a job application, and wrote an answer but couldn't press "submit" because my time was up, will they see my half-ready answer?
 Gusteau: hey guys
 Gusteau: is there any top coders who might help me..
 Uljahn: idk, sry
 Dumitron: if it's job related, should automatically submit even you had no time to press the button
 Synergyforge: It does auto-submit.
 MxCollard: Someone linked to me a site which contained all of the clash of code puzzles. Does anyone know where I can find that?

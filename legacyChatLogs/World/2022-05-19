 SpeedyGonzales123: ?tacos
 5DN1L: you get tacos when antiwonto is online and you type after the chat is quiet for &gt;30 minutes
 5DN1L: 1 taco for the first one who types
 5DN1L: You may also get tacos if they're on the floor in the #taco channel
 5DN1L: and from sharing and shakedown but you need to have more tacos first
 Darleanow: unfortunately he offline atm

 Sara87: hey, I'm new to this site! Can someone enlighten me: Are there hidden test cases in the Clashes? Because I ran my code against the test cases and got all correct, but my final score was 80% instead of 100% and now I'm confused lol
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: on submission your code is tested against the hidden test cases

 DomiKo: what is going on
 TINOUAINANI: need help in this puzzel "Robot Show"
 5DN1L: I'd like to know too 🤦 DomiKo
 TINOUAINANI: 3 days and i can,t solve it :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L: did you try a simple case as I suggested?
 Razovsky: hey 5DN1L some french trolls are usurping your name and picture apparently
 TINOUAINANI: yes i try to think simple but no result
 SLedolter: whats the main problem?
 5DN1L: Razovsky thanks, I know, reported
 TINOUAINANI: if any one have the sulotion becouse i give up :sweat_smile:
 Razovsky: TINOUAINANI not usually how we proceed, but we can help
 5DN1L: TINOUAINANI first tell me what the answer is if only one bot is present
 SLedolter: try to refactor and restructure your code into smaller parts so you can solve parts of the riddle
 porhnubgamer: hello
 Kirstein: what are you doing porhmubgamer???&#160;;)
 TINOUAINANI: closest side my be
 5DN1L: yes, that's right
 5DN1L: now check the movements of a simple case of 2 robots
 Razovsky: 5DN1L some french teachers use this platform to train their students, hence we regulargy have waves of no-brain kids going here to troll instead of working. Sorry for that
 TINOUAINANI: but if he have multiple robots the case change
 5DN1L: TINOUAINANI hold on
 5DN1L: we'll do it step by step
 5DN1L: Razovsky yes, unfortunately
 TINOUAINANI: ok i am with you
 5DN1L: say the platform contains 3 points 0, 1 and 2
 TINOUAINANI: ok
 5DN1L: if robot 1 starts at point 0
 5DN1L: moving to the right
 5DN1L: and robot 2 starts at point 2
 5DN1L: moving to the left
 5DN1L: they collide at point 1 right?
 TINOUAINANI: yes
 5DN1L: and after that what will happen?
 TINOUAINANI: the collide take one second and a fter the move the oppest way
 5DN1L: where will the robots be?
 5DN1L: at the next second
 TINOUAINANI: 1 wil be in 0 and 2 will be in 2
 5DN1L: do you think it's the same as if the collision does not happen? as if they can carry on moving in the original direction?
 TINOUAINANI: :relaxed:
 5DN1L: got it? :wink:
 TINOUAINANI: thank you, you save my day
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 RandomSteve: yo guys I finally could solve shadows of the knight episode 1

 TINOUAINANI: Woow a month&#160;?? 
 TINOUAINANI: the guy that jump from window to a nather&#160;?
 RandomSteve: well I mean not every day, but for the first two weeks it was about everyday
 Razovsky: nice man, proud of you
 Razovsky: you did it
 RandomSteve: thank you all so much for the nice comments
 TINOUAINANI: keep going like that
 RandomSteve: yes the guy that jumps from one window to another xd
 RandomSteve: thanks
 RandomSteve: special thanks to MACKEYTH and Wontonimo
 RandomSteve: and the youtube tutorials guys xd
 Urutar: Congratulations&#160;:)
 RandomSteve: I learned something very important, the hardest part and the most important is not how to code it but the concept algorithm and it's premises
 RandomSteve: thanks Urutar
 RandomSteve: (or expressed otherwise, what your code is going to do and why) that is more important than the commands
 RandomSteve: altough I learned some very useful syntax and commands
 MSmits: Yay, 37 endgame book for oware done and verified now. Started 38. It's drainig some resources :P
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/F77izyG">https://imgur.com/a/F77izyG</a>
 MSmits: hope having only 8 GB left on my PC for the next 2 weeks is not going to bother me :P
 MSmits: without the cache trick i found this would not even have been possible. It would have needed 40 GB
 Uljahn: impressive, what's the cache trick?
 MSmits: I have a capture cache to store boards with less seeds on them. I was always using this and storing all captures. But since these captures are always the same (those DBs are finished) and accessed in the same order, i dont need the whole cache all the time. I can cut it into chunks
 MSmits: this saves 15 GB
 MSmits: (for the 38 DB)
 MSmits: the 38 DB itself is 25, so it went from 40 to 25 usag
 MSmits: i do need the cache though, otherwise i am continuously accessing from the drive
 MSmits: i just dont need all of it at the same time
 TINOUAINANI: done 5DN1L thanks
 5DN1L: nice, np&#160;:)

 NinjaZMY: you thought me something new today
 derjack: :tada:
 SLedolter: "logic gates" puzzles was marvelous...easy cheesy, but fun to solve...
 SLedolter: can I check what solutions are published? I set auto-publish to "on" and want to see, which solutions are still private
 5DN1L: you can check the published solutions which are in the same programming languages as you use to solve the puzzle
 5DN1L: you cannot see the private solutions
 SLedolter: no, i want to check the state of my solutions...or are they all public automatic now through setting autopublish to on?
 SLedolter: the ones before setting autopublish...
 5DN1L: no, only the ones after
 struct: damn I forgot one rule for backgammon
 Yozamu: Does someone have tips for Mars Lander (episode 2)&#160;? I think I'm doing random stuff rn, just trying to adjust rotation and thrust power depending on kinda magic numbers
 derjack: struct the loser deletes account?
 struct: "if either number can be played but not both, the player must play the larger one"
 derjack: Yozamu mine is just bunch of ifs
 Yozamu: Really derjack&#160;? How well does it perform&#160;? I thought about adding more and more ifs, but I stopped, thinking it was messy and wrong
 VirtualRealityRocks: Yozamu I'm trying a genetic algorithm. There is an example linked to the puzzle
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/635937268">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/635937268</a>
 derjack: well, it doesnt crash
 Yozamu: Well nice enough, since I don't know about genetic algorithms (yet?) or other stuff like this. If a bunch of ifs can let me solve at least the puzzle that's nice
 Uljahn: Yozamu: i used simple feedback controller to calculate the angle based on the postion deviation and horizontal speed, like angle = delta_x/50 + h_speed, where delta_x is horizontal deviation from the center of landing zone, plus a bunch of ifs to cover some corner cases
 Uljahn: also you can compare how well it performs in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/mars-lander">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/mars-lander</a>
 Yozamu: Oh yeah that's the puzzle I was solving actually, but I wanted to make it work first, before even thinking about optimizing it
 coolcat3: Hey all! I am a first timer, trying to learn how to code. Anyone have recommendations on websites for a newbie?

 Lachrymosa: coolcat3 try geeks 4 geeks as well to show you multiple language examples of smaller useful concepts. And of course stack overflow
 Wontonimo: coolcat3 what language are you thinking of learning?
 Razovsky: yeah, it depends on what u plan to do
 succacactus: coolcat3 watch giraffe academy and caleb curry 's tutorial videos on youtube the sure helped me a lot 
 succacactus: i knew nothing before watching them
 Razovsky: for example, i planned nothing so i started C++ and Python, and a bit of Grooovy for Java things
 Wontonimo: Dan from "The Coding Train" on youtube is great for javascript
 Wontonimo: how goes simulation Razovsky&#160;?
 Razovsky: i did finish TTT
 Razovsky: struggled a lot for nothing
 Wontonimo: woot woot&#160;!
 Razovsky: thx again
 Wontonimo: oh, what you say for nothing?
 Razovsky: well
 Razovsky: stupid mistakes
 Razovsky: and strange ideas of mine to do a clean code instead of doing if/else on every solution
 Razovsky: ^^
 Wontonimo: what is clean code vs if/else&#160;?
 Razovsky: less if/else, a small function ^^
 Wontonimo: I don't see you on the UTTT leaderboard.  Did you submit your TTT bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe/leaderboard</a>
 struct: ok I think my backgammon is full of bugs
 struct: I should have read the rules of the game lol
 Wontonimo: ah, that's sad.  sorry to hear struct
 Wontonimo: one of the benefits of making your own game is that you can claim that "it's supposed to do that" retroactively
 Razovsky: no Wonto&#160;! i didn't for now actually ^^
 Wontonimo: got anything you could share for TTT (if you are interested and/or want feedback)
 XJDream: anyone?
 Wontonimo: no, the question was to Razovsky, who seems to be afk

 struct: Scarfield I have some backgammon questions
 Scarfield: sure
 struct: So imagine a scenario that play rolled 4 and 3 for example
 struct: If he plays 3 first he can then move again with 4
 struct: But if he moves with 4 first he cant move with 3
 struct: He must play 3 first right?
 Scarfield: im pretty sure both are legal, will try and check
 struct: "A player must use both numbers of a roll if this is legally possible"
 struct: I read this here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bkgm.com/rules.html">https://www.bkgm.com/rules.html</a>
 struct: If its right or not I dont know
 struct: I never played this game...,
 Scarfield: hmm didnt know that actually
 Scarfield: seems weird since it is a racing game, you should be allowed to make a move that doesnt get you as far with pieces
 struct: yeah
 struct: I also read it just now on other site
 struct: so it must be right
 struct: "If a player can, he has to use both of the numbers rolled. If either can be done but not both the larger one must be taken. In the event of a player being unable to do either number he loses his turn."
 Alfador: hi, anyone knows how to use libraries, e.g. rand in Rust?
 Scarfield: yea same for me
 Alfador: it doesn't seem to find them with e.g. use rand::

 Alfador: hm... ok, that seems to actually work
 Alfador: use rand::Rng; but the IDE does show an error message
 struct: yeah its probably broken
 Alfador: "unresolved import"
 struct: But I use rust or the ide so im safe
 struct: but I dont use*

 qraqqryq: I did it on large type and if string length is above large type number of digits i divided it into two strings 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: compare your code to others who have finished it in your lang, u might find stuff that's better for future use...tmi
 qraqqryq: I wrote class with static methods to deal with it and keep the code clean
 jacek: clean code? :scream:

 cegprakash: did anyone have success with backward WINGARDIUM?
 dbdr: what is that cegprakash?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sogeti-codefest-2021">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sogeti-codefest-2021</a> 
 dbdr: I mean, backward?
 cegprakash: it's the new version of fantastic bits where one spell is removed and 1 spell is changed dbdr
 cegprakash: yeah dbdr
 cegprakash: using wingardium to pull instead of push
 cegprakash: it's weird to see Accio's animation for wingardium instead of Filipendo
 dbdr: you can push in any direction you wish
 cegprakash: after wingardium this game looks more like harry potter now over football :D
 cegprakash: but still the top guys play through balls and play like football :D
 dbdr: what do you suggest to do instead?
 dbdr: some bots don't use magics, it's true
 dbdr: e.g.  Jeff
 cegprakash: a new animation to differentiate
 cegprakash: I haven't forgot the accio animation
 cegprakash: so seeing the same animation for different spell is weird
 dbdr: forget about FB for now&#160;;)
 cegprakash: I can't forget FB ever
 cegprakash: that's probably the game that made me come to this website :D
 cegprakash: that's the game where I defined const long double PI = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494;
 cegprakash: lot of learnings
 dbdr: is that useful?
 Astrobytes: he didn't know about M_PI&#160;;)
 dbdr: rockstars recalculate an approximate of PI in the first turn
 martinpapa69: I wonder mow much time would take to calculate first 20 digits of pi
 dbdr: not much with a fast method, I think
 Astrobytes: you can get the first 16 in hex
 Astrobytes: eg <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/baileyborweinplouffe-pi">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/baileyborweinplouffe-pi</a>
 dbdr: 1. make your bot parametric on PI2. tune the parameter to increase winrate
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 dbdr: a novel method to calculate PI
 dbdr: I should publich it
 cegprakash: I found a bug in my 7 yr old FB code :D time to resubmit :D
 dbdr: FB is 7 years old? :O TIL
 derjack: facebook is older
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/429a2ce9-2c54-4e0e-ac7f-2d46b7484fa2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/429a2ce9-2c54-4e0e-ac7f-2d46b7484fa2</a>
 martinpapa69: 7 years holy moly
 struct: no way its 7 years
 LoGos: No no you repeatedly drop a stick on a tiled floor to calculate pi
 LoGos: With correct dimensions probability involves pi 
 martinpapa69: i dont think so either
 Astrobytes: 2016 no?
 struct: 4 years
 cegprakash: don't tell me I made such stupid bugs just 5 yrs back :D
 Astrobytes: every day is a learning day&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: And bugs like that are easy to create
 struct: november 2016
 dbdr: ceg got the task 2 years in advance
 cegprakash: I wouldn't have found the bug even for 10 more years if only the CG IDE didn't highlight that line :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 struct: that was your first mistake
 struct: using cg ide
 dbdr: reverse. CG ide found the bug
 cegprakash: I've no idea what IDE I used 5 yrs back
 cegprakash: may be dev cpp
 Astrobytes: MS Word?
 cegprakash: climbed 100 ranks with the bugfix in fantastic bits :D and 10 ranks in Sogeti
 cegprakash: I would have reached legend league had I found this bug during the contest
 cegprakash: at that time there were very few in gold
 derjack: :o
 cegprakash: we should revive all old games and change spells so we can fix old bugs :D
 Astrobytes: Or... you could fix your old code.
 martinpapa69: a new, original game would be fun too
 dbdr: there are plenty of commu games
 struct: just play amazons
 struct: best game
 cegprakash: Astrobytes :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 dbdr: what was the bug cegprakash?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/429a2ce9-2c54-4e0e-ac7f-2d46b7484fa2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/429a2ce9-2c54-4e0e-ac7f-2d46b7484fa2</a>
 dbdr: yeah, that's the kind of typo a tool can detect automatically
 PKDEVN: hello
 cegprakash: just found another function which always returns false 
 cegprakash: omg :D 
 struct: you are probably better by just rewriting
 Wontonimo: def cegprakash():
 martinpapa69: or you can you the code that Magus shared
 dbdr: lol
 Wontonimo: i found another!
 cegprakash: yup :D I see 30 warnings in my old code in CG IDE
 DaNinja: in Sogeti, what does round half way to the center of the field mean for say 15999.1?
 dbdr: 15999&#160;?
 struct: its normal round
 struct: velocity is truncated
 struct: position is rounded
 DaNinja: 0.5 -&gt; 0 and 15999.5 -&gt; 16000
 DaNinja: according to statement
 struct: yes
 struct: wait no
 dbdr: round to even, no?
 struct: hmm
 dbdr: only matters for 0.5
 dbdr: x.5
 struct: yeah
 Wontonimo: i thought velocity was truncated so that you don't end up with a constant velocity of 1 and never stop from friction
 struct: round(0.5) =&gt; 0
 struct: round(1.5)=&gt;2
 Wontonimo: that's "bankers rounding"
 Stilgart: dbdr: +tie
 Stilgart: round tie to even
 DaNinja: 15998.5 -&gt; 15999
 dbdr: x.5 &lt;=&gt; a tie, no?
 Stilgart: round to even means that the result is always even
 Stilgart: 1.1 --&gt; 2
 Stilgart: &lt;/pedantic&gt;
 derjack: thats odd
 DaNinja: :confused:
 dbdr: lol
 Stilgart: derjack&#160;:)
 struct: who coded this
 martinpapa69: full simu code btw:

 dbdr: * ties are rounded to nearest fibonacci number
 struct: round(n / 2) * 2
 struct: will round to nearest even number
 struct: according to stackoverflow
 DaNinja: ... "where "zero" is the centre of the field"
 DaNinja: round(x-8000) + 8000
 DaNinja: I guess
 dbdr: how stable is the lb? FB as a game seems pretty chaotic to me
 struct: top 2 bots have huge lead against rest
 dbdr: in FB or sogeti?
 struct: FB
 struct: if you are insterested check rank 8
 struct: its pb 4 without spells
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct: on fb

 struct: yes
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes, and i really have no idea
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: Oo
 Marchete: jacek, CSB or UTTT
 Astrobytes: óó
 jacek: no
 dbdr: jacek, fb is in the air
 jacek: i thought they fight in the water
 dbdr: nope, flying on broomsticks
 struct: im still not sure if i should participate
 struct: I can probably use the sim I have and avoid the rewrite
 Astrobytes: so you're working on it all week but not submitting until 1 hour before the end then?
 FalINTOblivion0112: how many mods are there in codingame?
 dbdr: don't you do that already struct?
 jacek: lets make new game, realistic bytes
 struct: dbdr i have a full sim
 struct: but its very slow
 struct: I get like 40k sims in 95ms
 struct: maybe it will be faster with another algo
 struct: since im using 4 mcts trees
 dbdr: 40k turns?
 struct: yes
 dbdr: sims has to be slow if you want to do collisions exactly, I think
 martinpapa69: that doesnt sound that few
 jacek: 4 mcts trees?
 struct: yes i use smitsimax currently
 jacek: is that... mcts forest?
 struct: yes
 jacek: who names the algo after their name :unamused:
 Marchete: structymax
 martinpapa69: its a reinvented algo, others call it decoupled mcts
 dbdr: that's not the same
 struct: ok its smitsimax
 struct: I think
 martinpapa69: oh. whats the difference&#160;?
 struct: no idea
 dbdr: in smitsimax every tree ignores what the others did in previous turns
 dbdr: it's an abomination&#160;;)
 struct: yes
 struct:&#160;:(
 martinpapa69: and d-mcts you find the corresponding node for the current state&#160;?
 martinpapa69: in every tree
 dbdr: yes
 martinpapa69: ah okay, so in analog games, like this  one it wouldnt work
 dbdr: why not?
 dbdr: you need to limit the number of actions in any case
 martinpapa69: ye you have right
 martinpapa69: you need to limit the actions anyways...
 struct: probably not the game for me
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 jacek: its somewhat football too
 MSmits: smitsimax is a way to get some good depth by trading away accuracy of the state of the game. This is the difference with DUCT. Duct is accurate when it comes to the gamestate, but has more branching
 MSmits: if smitsimax has branching N, then DUCT has N^2, even with only 2 agents
 MSmits: with 4 agents it'd be N^4
 MSmits: mcts forest is apparently an alternative name
 Astrobytes: *UCT Forest
 MSmits: first one I heard anyways, it fits
 MSmits: oh right uct forest
 MSmits: i think it's similar to running a beamsearch when ignoring opponent, like you do in some games
 MSmits: or doing a GA while making assumptions about the opponent
 MSmits: all ways to give up accuracy in the gamestate to get some more depth in the search
 jacek: "- i cant count fast. - what's 13*24? - 110. - that's wrong. - but it's fast." :drum:

 Coyote44: HiI'm new on codinGameI'm currently on a clash, and want to submit my codeI have passed all the tests but chen I click on submit, nothing happens
 MSmits: maybe you need to wait for opponents? I don't know, I don't clash 
 eulerscheZahl: something should happen on submit
 eulerscheZahl: you should exit the IDE and get to a result page
 eulerscheZahl: try F5

 iok-1: rm -rf /home
 jacek: rm -rf /clash
 eulerscheZahl: that's a reasonable suggestion
 eulerscheZahl: i would even sudo that
 dbdr: # Let's put an end to all this rm'ingsudo rm $(which rm)
 eulerscheZahl: can rm delete itself?
 martinpapa69: there is only one way to find it out
 dbdr: try it. but I think so
 eulerscheZahl: just add an alias vim=rm to your .bash_rc
 dbdr: LD
 dbdr: rm just removes a reference to the contents, not the file itself, which gets deleted later if there are no uses left
 eulerscheZahl: but can you shred shred?
 dbdr: so you can delete an open file and it works fine. it's a problem on windows, I least it used to be
 eulerscheZahl: you are right, i remember deleting some videos I downloaded while still watching them to the end. worked fine

 Illedan: Anyone around knows custom loss function tf.keras good?
 Illedan: I  wonder if I can do conditional evaluation. Like if y_true first value is greater than 0 =&gt; do mse of index 1+2 else do mse of index 3+4. If that makes sense?
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean if we know whether the function is good?
 Illedan: No, I wonder if you got serious skills in the area :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh, if we know it well
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea about it :D
 Illedan: Thx for your time :D 
 eulerscheZahl: always nice to troll you

 Illedan: I know, you like to mock my useless spelling skill
 Illedan: Marchete?
 Illedan: I realised so much martinpapa69 :P
 reCurse: I don't know keras but you probably want to do masking
 Illedan: Yeah, struggling to find the correct way of doing it. I have so many tabs open now -.-
 reCurse: Usually you can just have a tensor expressing your condition as 0 or 1 and then multiply it
 reCurse: Or and it if it's possible
 reCurse: That's why pytorch does behind the scenes if I'm not wrong
 reCurse: *what
 Wontonimo: hey Illedan, sorry for the late response but i can help you with the custom loss function in tf.keras
 Wontonimo: ping me if you are still looking for something and haven't solved it already

 FalINTOblivion0112: hey count me in
 Wontonimo: cool
 FalINTOblivion0112: in addition have you heard about the clash of code bots
 FalINTOblivion0112: like BSoD, Tycknorg, etc.
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: maybe
 FalINTOblivion0112: they are clash of code bots
 FalINTOblivion0112: next time you go into a clash of code
 FalINTOblivion0112: look for them and look at their profiles
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah, there be bots there.  most of them are
 FalINTOblivion0112: what?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 FalINTOblivion0112: most of them are bots
 code_destroyer405: Check your code 
 code_destroyer405: do you think you fixed the problem? Run your code to check if it works! 
 Wontonimo: yeah, if a room doesn't get about 4 people in a reasonable amount of time, the remainder are bots
 Wontonimo: something like that
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh i see
 FalINTOblivion0112: that makes sense
 Wontonimo: keeps things moving
 FalINTOblivion0112: bitwolf is alos a bot
 Wontonimo: but they are just "ghosts" of other actual players submits
 FalINTOblivion0112: what does that mean
 Wontonimo: so, in effect _you_are_clashing_in_the_past_wow
 FalINTOblivion0112: ah i see
 FalINTOblivion0112: they just take random samples of player's code from the past and submit it
 Wontonimo: a particular bot will pick from previous answers to that clash, and use the pevious person time as their time
 FalINTOblivion0112: i see how it works
 Wontonimo: ah
 FalINTOblivion0112: the ide then be like
 Wontonimo: but i could keep explaining it to make things uncomfortable 
 FalINTOblivion0112: it is... acceptable
 MSmits: would be interested to see it paste a solution in 3 seconds like people who keep solution databases :P
 FalINTOblivion0112: mmm that would be CHEATING
 FalINTOblivion0112: but who cares
 Wontonimo: is it?  or is it meta-programming to beat the programming game?
 MSmits: of course it's cheating, but it would be funny to see a bot mindlessly copy that solution + time
 FalINTOblivion0112: wontonimo
 FalINTOblivion0112: i have a problem
 FalINTOblivion0112: i need to reach the top 3% of the clash of code leaderboard
 reCurse: It's the exact reason why they added a captcha
 FalINTOblivion0112: how tf am i going to do that\
 FalINTOblivion0112: captcha?
 MSmits: practice 
 Wontonimo: don't worry about it
 Wontonimo: come back in a year when you are better

 FalINTOblivion0112: can you guys like and approve this contribution?
 FalINTOblivion0112: or just like it
 FalINTOblivion0112: i need it for a skill tree level-up
 FalINTOblivion0112: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7170e2aa0081c811d945e5e90a5d08c92a2c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7170e2aa0081c811d945e5e90a5d08c92a2c</a>
 Wontonimo: i mean, if you REALLY want to be FAST at those games, then don't just practice by doing the puzzles, but also memorize them like crazy
 FalINTOblivion0112: memorize them? noted.
 MSmits: i see no point to memorizing
 FalINTOblivion0112: but wateva
 Wontonimo: i do
 FalINTOblivion0112: can you upvote this
 MSmits: if you're going to memorize a solution, just make a database
 FalINTOblivion0112: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7170e2aa0081c811d945e5e90a5d08c92a2c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7170e2aa0081c811d945e5e90a5d08c92a2c</a>
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh?
 MSmits: why would you memorize Wontonimo?
 FalINTOblivion0112: where is he i need this contrib like right now
 Wontonimo: i man, for you MSmits, it's not a good plan cuz you are already know your stuff.  I mean for someone at the beginning of their career or education
 MSmits: yes but what would you memorize?
 Wontonimo: you can code in you head faster than you can type
 FalINTOblivion0112: that's facts
 MSmits: that's very true
 MSmits: I type way too slow for my head
 FalINTOblivion0112: i dream of clash of code while i sleep
 Wontonimo: but you see, my experience with junior coders is that they spend SO MUCH TIME wading through the syntax and basics, that the act
 FalINTOblivion0112: i spent 3 years perfecting my python3 skills
 Wontonimo: of typing it out AGAIN and AGAIN actually burns it in so that it is more like a reflex
 MSmits: ahh so by memorizing , you mean small snippets
 FalINTOblivion0112: then i won a coding contest at my school at python
 MSmits: i thought you meant memorizing whole clashes
 FalINTOblivion0112: its a gradual memory process
 FalINTOblivion0112: you basically memorize everything
 Wontonimo: yes.  with a focus on typing it once without syntax errors or having to look up "why"
 FalINTOblivion0112: that's the point
 Wontonimo: in a timely fashion
 MSmits: yeah ok, but there's no real point in focusing too much on that. It should happen naturally while practicing 
 FalINTOblivion0112: well yeah
 FalINTOblivion0112: guys may i interrupt for a moment
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: i'm on a roll
 FalINTOblivion0112: uh-
 Wontonimo: i'm about to beat MSmits in a contest of wits
 MSmits: not if you're going to paste the contribution again
 FalINTOblivion0112: i mean like for a contribution i made
 Wontonimo: it'll be a first for me
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh
 Wontonimo: and i need to cherish it
 FalINTOblivion0112: no im not going to paste the contrib again
 Wontonimo: bwahahah
 Wontonimo: jk.  what's up
 FalINTOblivion0112: but i am legit praying for upvotes
 MSmits: dont paste contributions here. I also don't approve of people doing contributions just to get a quest achievement
 MSmits: you should do them because you have a good idea
 MSmits: I never did that quest
 FalINTOblivion0112: thank you for your wise words
 MSmits: we have too many bad puzzles and clashes
 MSmits: and some people approve anything
 FalINTOblivion0112: i dont approve anything
 MSmits: not you
 MSmits: the people who approve
 FalINTOblivion0112: but the first puzzle i made was rejected 3 times under 1 hour
 MSmits: someone makes a bad clash for a quest achievement
 MSmits: then it gets approved even though it's bad
 FalINTOblivion0112: that's what i hate
 MSmits: why
 MSmits: did they have a good reason for rejecting?
 Wontonimo: yeah, first couple puzzles i made were horrible
 Wontonimo: got good (harsh) feedback
 Wontonimo: read it
 MSmits: they should not reject without reason
 Wontonimo: sent hate mail
 FalINTOblivion0112: then it shows up when i play clash of code
 MSmits: but they should reject every time they find something wrong
 Wontonimo: then upped my game
 FalINTOblivion0112: im like: wait the statement dosen't even tell me what the variables are and what they do
 MSmits: so.. bad clash
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 MSmits: precisely my point
 FalINTOblivion0112: precisely
 MSmits: bad stuff gets accepted. So people need to be strict and reject
 FalINTOblivion0112: there
 MSmits: and also, people should not make clashes or puzzles just for a quest achievement
 MSmits: glad we all agree
 FalINTOblivion0112: at least i agree
 Wontonimo: yeah, look at some of the "easy" practice challenges that have lots of stars for examples of good writeups
 FalINTOblivion0112: i contribute the the community
 FalINTOblivion0112: it is OUR puzzles
 FalINTOblivion0112: OUR clash of codes
 MSmits: it is
 Wontonimo: and we are all equal
 FalINTOblivion0112: a communist society
 FalINTOblivion0112: in a nutshell
 MSmits: not really, not unless we stop doing it for free
 FalINTOblivion0112: well...
 MSmits: they idea is that people all get paid the same in communism, but they do get paid
 FalINTOblivion0112: some however more than others
 MSmits: no in the ideal of it
 MSmits: not
 FalINTOblivion0112: have you read animal farm
 MSmits: just like the ideal of capitalism doens't always match reality
 FalINTOblivion0112: the book animal farm
 MSmits: no
 FalINTOblivion0112: well there is a world-famous quote in it
 MSmits: i know the quote
 FalINTOblivion0112: all coders are equal, but some are more equal then others
 MSmits: yes i know the quote
 MSmits: but you are confusing two things
 FalINTOblivion0112: yeah its funny
 MSmits: communism the idea and communism in practice
 FalINTOblivion0112: communism the political system is currently in play
 MSmits: the whole thing about some being more equal in practice is not the idea
 FalINTOblivion0112: but the idea of absolute communism is impossible
 MSmits: thats how it turns out
 MSmits: of course it is
 MSmits: just like any absolute is
 FalINTOblivion0112: trying to practice communism dosen't mean you get it right
 MSmits: of course not
 Wontonimo: what the heck?
 Wontonimo: code and dad jokes people
 FalINTOblivion0112: the very idea of communism from the beginning falls on the fatal flaw of human nature
 MSmits: right
 FalINTOblivion0112: what do we want the most in life
 Wontonimo: socialism
 MSmits: differs for everyone
 FalINTOblivion0112: no, power
 Wontonimo: tacos
 MSmits: no, differs for everyone
 FalINTOblivion0112: uh.
 MSmits: there's is no single answer
 Astrobytes: :taco:
 Wontonimo: very much tacos
 FalINTOblivion0112: right
 FalINTOblivion0112: tacos
 MSmits: tacos for some, indeed
 Wontonimo: thank you&#160;!
 FalINTOblivion0112: yeah
 FalINTOblivion0112: i love tacos, i have to admit
 FalINTOblivion0112: first, i follow everybody in chat
 Astrobytes: you're lucky I was right in time, just came back from afk, going afk again
 FalINTOblivion0112: hello astrobytes
 Wontonimo: ur awesome Astrobytes
 FalINTOblivion0112: how was your afk session
 Wontonimo: so, c++ question
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes?
 FalINTOblivion0112: i dont know c++ but, either way...
 MSmits: i'll try Wontonimo
 MSmits: but i dont know much
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e86bfb11-c9a0-49a2-9e79-8a43b9d76d55">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e86bfb11-c9a0-49a2-9e79-8a43b9d76d55</a>
 MSmits: nope, never did
 Wontonimo: the ":2" to indicate only 2 bits
 MSmits: i do try to cram bits, but never like that
 Wontonimo: ah
 MSmits: probabyl should
 MSmits: btw, this is only worth it when you are memory limited
 MSmits: overall, or by cache
 Wontonimo: i haven't seen it help much.  Definitely didn't do anything for me in UTTT
 Wontonimo: I got my Node down to 15 bytes
 MSmits: no, it probably wouldn't
 MSmits: 15 bytes wouldnt be better than 16 anyways
 Wontonimo: i think the overhead of unpacking used up all gains from cache hits
 MSmits: yeah
 Wontonimo: it was 26bytes or something like that before 
 Wontonimo: yeah, i know about the 16/32 things
 MSmits: i usually keep it at 24
 Wontonimo: (there is a 16/32 thing right)
 MSmits: no i think it goes in steps of 4 or 8 bytes
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: i'll check that out, thanks
 MSmits: i'm no expert on this, mind you
 Wontonimo: noted
 MSmits: but i do try to always limit to 24, unless i save my state on the node
 reCurse: Alignment goes with the size of the largest basic type
 FalINTOblivion0112: recurse joins the chat
 Wontonimo: can you say that another way reCurse&#160;?  I think i get it, but help please
 MSmits: someone told me you can allign on 4  byte types even if you have an 8 byte type in your struct
 MSmits: i think it was struct
 MSmits: but maybe not automatically
 Wontonimo: so if the Class has a basic type of 8 bytes, it is aligned on 8 bytes regardless of the 1 byte members?
 MSmits: I think what recurse means is that if you have a uint64_t in there, it's gonna be 16 bytes even if you only put 9 bytes in there
 MSmits: i think the problem is this
 MSmits: if you pack it any other way
 MSmits: the uint64_t is going to be split across a boundary
 MSmits: if you have it as uint64_t -&gt; byte -&gt; another uint64_t
 reCurse: There's also the alignment of each individual member to take into account
 reCurse: So that makes two
 MSmits: yeah that's what i meant
 MSmits: is it called a memory register?
 reCurse: so if you have a struct with {int, uint64_t, int} it will be size 24
 MSmits: in that case, the uint64_t cant be split between registers
 reCurse: {uint64_t, int, int} will be 16
 MSmits: right
 reCurse: but {int8_t,int8_t,int8_t} will be 3
 MSmits: 3 bytes?
 reCurse: {int,int8_t,int8_t,int8_t} will be 8
 Wontonimo: nice
 MSmits: got it
 MSmits: this is how i always packed stuff 
 MSmits: largest item first
 reCurse: {int8_t,int,int8_t,int8_t} will be 12
 MSmits: but you can give it instructions to  pack it more efficiently right?
 MSmits: with some loss of performance?
 MSmits: but gain in memory?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: This is where i make a sizeof(===D) joke right?
 reCurse: Sure though I'm not sure it's standard
 reCurse: I have yet to see a single instance that's worth it outside of serializing a weird struct and even then
 MSmits: yeah it's better to just be mindful of this
 Wontonimo: back when i worked at Nortel on their switches, they did lots of bit packing.  All coded in Pascal.  Crazy times
 u9g: yo what is happening in world chat
 u9g: lol
 MSmits: i'm going to bed is what's happening&#160;:)
 MSmits: gn
 codecrow: im late but i vote tacos
 Mochlek: smae
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it is tuesday
 Wontonimo: so would {uint64_t b[2],uint8_t p} be 16*3 bytes?
 MSmits: 8*3
 Wontonimo: right, cuz i can't math
 Wontonimo: thanks
 MSmits: np, gn 
 Wontonimo: gn
 Wontonimo: thanks for the byte alignment mini-review 
 Wontonimo: good stuff
 iBug: Hi bro
 Wontonimo: hi
 iBug: Good morning

 iBug: oh yeah I forgot the jet lag
 FalINTOblivion0112: 30 puzzles solved in python
 FalINTOblivion0112: lets goo
 iBug: You go, I'm still learning python

 Gameonn: anything for php?
 FalINTOblivion0112: PHP?
 FalINTOblivion0112: the language php?
 Gameonn: Yes
 Parceni: lol PHP
 mrmindx1: wtf
 thePython: Python the best
 mrmindx1: your name is python
 mrmindx1: so you king of python
 thePython: obviously
 thePython: what is your language 
 Hydrazer: it is not python

 Wontonimo: for those python fans out there
 Wontonimo: looks like we got a lot of new coders
 Wontonimo: welcome
 7lck: i'm not good at python
 Wontonimo: what are you good at?
 7lck: This is too unfriendly to C ++
 Wontonimo: really?
 Wontonimo: are you only doing Clash of Code?
 Wontonimo: let me introduce you to something a lot more fun where you c++ skills will be loved
 Wontonimo: bot programming, aka multis
 Wontonimo: take a look at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard?column=LANGUAGE&amp;value=Python3">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard?column=LANGUAGE&amp;value=Python3</a>
 Wontonimo: no, not that link

 7lck: sounds great
 Wontonimo: i can give you a quick run down and intro
 Wontonimo: anyone else interested?  I'll make a chat room if that's the case

 eulerscheZahl: oh, another hypnotoad
 hydroglicerol: there multiplying I thought he was you 
 hydroglicerol: you have to pronounce your dominance to attract mates its what all toads do

 eulerscheZahl: i will hate you forever
 hydroglicerol: that doesnt sound horrible I was expecting instant death
 LelouchVC2: I still can't believe its not butter
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/
 LelouchVC2: Same
 LelouchVC2: I tried it, it definitely does not taste like butter
 Nerchio: euler you're not coming back to PR2?
 NicatSadiqov: 15xfb1111o17
 NicatSadiqov: is it not pointer?
 NicatSadiqov: in reverse question, 15 ---- xfb1111o17
 LelouchVC2: A pointer would not be the same every run
 LelouchVC2: So it wouldn't make sense for a pointer to be the output since it can't be confirmed
 NicatSadiqov: thanks guy
 JKSTUDIOS2020: :wink:
 Illedan: Nice rank Nerchio
 Astrobytes: ooof yeah, grats Nerchio
 WINWINWIN: Nicely done Nerchio, gl Illedan hope you win&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: PHP bots cannot come first :P
 Nerchio: thx :P
 kovi: great improvement nerchio!
 Nerchio:&#160;:)
 Nerchio: or maybe lucky submit
 MSmits: PR-2?
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 Nerchio: ye
 MSmits: cool, gj Nerchio
 Nerchio: you will try MSmits?
 kovi: well, being only specator i cant tell
 MSmits: I like the game, but I don't have much of an idea of where too start. I talked to Thiesjoo and his ideas where also my ideas and after he implemented them he got stuck
 WINWINWIN: Doesnt it seem a lot like GitC?
 MSmits: I mean, when he explained them to me, i thought, well... that would be what I would have tried first
 MSmits: yeah, WINWINWIN, that is the problem :P
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Nerchio: only a little bit similar
 MSmits: also, believe it or not... i am still doing uttt :P
 Nerchio: since your units don't really get stuck if you send them somewhere
 WINWINWIN: Arent you 1st?
 MSmits: not atm
 MSmits: I could cheese my way to 1st if i want to, but i want a bot that is significantly better
 MSmits: so i am rewriting it
 MSmits: different searches etc.
 WINWINWIN: Full rewrite to minimax?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: mcts variant
 MSmits: I think I have a good evaluation function, so trying various ways to put that in
 WINWINWIN: Isnt the only important part of the search the eval function?
 MSmits: you can use an eval function in many ways and that is pretty important
 MSmits: but sure, if its bad, the whole bot is bad
 WINWINWIN: Good luck&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's like this: If  you're doing a running competition and you're training hard and you're super fast, you'll still lose if you run in the wrong direction
 WINWINWIN: Makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: "Nerchio 11:51AMeuler you're not coming back to PR2?"probably not
 eulerscheZahl: i know 2 or 3 things to improve. but not really motivated

 journeyvivek: hello
 hydroglicerol: hew
 hydroglicerol: winwinwin
 hydroglicerol: I am not 100% sure
 hydroglicerol: but I think they have it
 Hjax: i havent come up with a good way to decide when to re-explore areas in PR2 yet 
 Hjax: right now my pods just head to the enemy base if they dont see anywhere obvious to go 
 Hjax: but sometimes that results in the enemy retaking a lot of space on the map and killing me 
 eulerscheZahl: how mea
 eulerscheZahl: n
 Hjax: yeah people should just let me win
 BigUP: seem's the best to do
 IamTheSmix: what is the best structure to choose for storing data in the  UTTT contest&#160;? 
 Hjax: bitboards
 Uljahn: for storing MCTS tree nodes you mean?
 Hjax: oh i interpreted it as for a single position, 
 IamTheSmix: for nodes yes
 Uljahn: some sort of an array of structs perhaps
 IamTheSmix: I use this 
 IamTheSmix: class Node(): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0a0c792b-dda2-43e8-a590-e3575a8deaae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0a0c792b-dda2-43e8-a590-e3575a8deaae</a>
 IamTheSmix: Its cost me like 2 ms to create one node
 ZarthaxX: python is not the right choice :sweat:
 Uljahn: you have 1 sec on the first turn, so create a pool for nodes and reuse them later without creating new ones
 Uljahn: ZarthaxX: i agree it's nearly impossible to reach legend with python but still you can learn MCTS with it
 IamTheSmix: My idea is just learn MCTS and reach Gold iwth python 
 Hjax: id be pretty impressed if someone reached legend with python in uttt
 Uljahn: IamTheSmix: for python i'd go with numpy -- it has nice structured arrays
 IamTheSmix: I used numpy 
 MSmits: IamTheSmix dont store the boardstate on the node
 MSmits: just the move is enough
 MSmits: when you go down the tree, you apply the moves 
 Uljahn: also gold can be reached without trees with plain UCB1 like in MAB
 IamTheSmix: @MSmits I agree I can remove the boardstate 
 IamTheSmix: for example&#160;: if I want to get available moves from board I use&#160;: np.argwhere(board == empty) 
 IamTheSmix: that cost me 1.9 ms 
 MSmits: I have a minimax tic tac toe bot in python that uses bitboards
 MSmits: maybe you can walk through it for some performance improvements?
 IamTheSmix: Yeah I would like to
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://repl.it/@msmits/Tic-Tac-Toe">https://repl.it/@msmits/Tic-Tac-Toe</a>
 MSmits: there's a lot of draw functions and such, minimize that
 MSmits: not sure if it is helpful, but it works quite well
 IamTheSmix: thank you 
 MSmits: np... this is just an experiment of mine to practice python. I needed to learn it for teaching
 MostComplicatedUsername: msmits you're not part of the pr2 contest?
 MSmits: not atm no
 MSmits: maybe later
 MostComplicatedUsername: Why?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Okay
 MSmits: it's not an official contest so it's not really enough to draw me away from uttt&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: Only 7 days left...
 MostComplicatedUsername: Still doing uttt?
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: well it's not just uttt, i am also experimenting with different mcts stuff. If I make something work, I can use it for other multis
 MostComplicatedUsername: AH
 MSmits: I used what worked for me in oware, in onitama and got nr 1 there
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ah*
 MostComplicatedUsername: :thumbsup:
 IamTheSmix: MSmits I read somthing like hybrid MCTS 
 IamTheSmix: you know about this&#160;? 
 IamTheSmix: any thoughts&#160;? 
 MSmits: it's a bit vague. Have to know what you're hybrid-ing
 Uljahn: solver? MCTS with minimax?
 MSmits: probably using an evaluation function
 IamTheSmix: MCTS with minimax
 MSmits: right, you can do that
 MSmits: a solver is not really a hybrid though
 IamTheSmix: and mabye they add also multi MCTS 
 IamTheSmix: like two agents exploring two trees 
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: that exists
 IamTheSmix: but this can't work on CG
 MSmits: DUCT
 MSmits: works on CG
 MSmits: jolindien won xmas rush with it
 inoryy: do you know if anyone used AZ for UTTT?
 MSmits: whats AZ again?
 inoryy: alphazero
 MSmits: dont think so
 MSmits: I was thinking about trying it, but you need so much calc time 
 IamTheSmix: I was hoping to train my NN on it 
 IamTheSmix: but can't on CG
 Uljahn: i heard reCurs e have failed with NNs for uTTT
 MSmits: re curse did try a nn yeah
 MSmits: I think if you want to try a nn for it, you should try offline first, without the limitations of CG, to see if it is even viable
 MostComplicatedUsername: I like your pfp ulj ahn
 MSmits: there's so much room to experiment with NN's, I am pretty sure one is possible for uttt
 MostComplicatedUsername: Imagine not just randomly placing
 MostComplicatedUsername: smh
 MSmits: I am also sure that any bot that is somewhat deterministic (doesnt have to be fully deterministic) can be beaten 100% when they are p2
 MSmits: at least... I am 99% sure this game is solved as win for p1
 Uljahn: MSmits: is you meta-MCTS still going?
 IamTheSmix: maybe drawn&#160;!
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it is
 IamTheSmix: SmitsMax
 IamTheSmix: mine is SmixMax
 MSmits: IamTheSmix, I haven't succeeded in finding a path to draw that works
 IamTheSmix: oh what was the problems&#160;? 
 MSmits: I can take any series of moves of a game that I lost or drew as p2. Put it into mcts and then work back along the game until i find my mistake
 MSmits: if i correct that mistake, i win as p1
 MSmits: as p1 i mean
 MSmits: I havent found a draw i couldnt solve that way
 MSmits: the current line of play of karlis o I solved from ply 25 or so
 MSmits: he always plays the same moves up to 25 as a reaction to my moves and then he loses
 MostComplicatedUsername: just add an if statement for that one situation&#160;:)
 MSmits: this version is not on the leaderboard though... I want a real improvement, not a cheesy opening book one 
 IamTheSmix: how about making two algorithms&#160;: minimax for like 25 moves early in the game and then switch to MCTS after&#160;? 
 MostComplicatedUsername: And pretty soon your code becomes an if jungle
 MSmits: I dont need an if statement
 MSmits: I have an opening book. Every turn i check the book, if the gamestate is in there, i play from there
 MSmits: ok, so 1 if statement&#160;:)
 IamTheSmix: oh like Alpha-zero
 MSmits: no alpha zero is completely a different thing
 MSmits: it's a mcts with a neural network
 IamTheSmix: he uses also opening book 
 MSmits: sure, it can do that, but thats' just a bonus, it's not the actual alpha zero
 MSmits: you can use opening books with any  algo
 IamTheSmix: is it possible on CG&#160;? 
 MSmits: what is
 IamTheSmix: use openning book&#160;? 
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i have it on uttt and yavalath
 MostComplicatedUsername: lots of typing...
 IamTheSmix: how to get data on CG&#160;? 
 MSmits: just part of the code
 Hjax: got to be careful about the code size limits though 
 Uljahn: it's more like hardcoding, ye
 IamTheSmix: ah but it souldn't over pass 50k&#160;!
 Hjax: cant just export a massive tree
 MSmits: for uttt mine is 8 kb and not even efficiently compressed
 Hjax: how deep is it MSmits
 MSmits: depends, as i said, against karlis o I go extremely deep, i just follow his moves. Maybe I use 50-100 moves just for his line of play. Probably 35 plies deep, some of them
 IamTheSmix: I see intresting
 Uljahn: does it account for symmetry?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: even symmetry between players
 IamTheSmix: you took acount of reflexion too&#160;? 
 MSmits: so an inverted board will have the same move
 MSmits: with all Xs being Os
 MSmits: reflection and rotation yes
 IamTheSmix: did you get real bonux for rotation and reflection&#160;? 
 MSmits: not that much
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: it does for the start
 MSmits: because the first move of p2 has only 2 real possibilities
 MSmits: corner and side
 MSmits: without the symmetry it would be 8
 IamTheSmix: I see
 MSmits: jacek hi
 MSmits: other types of transpositions are super rare though
 MSmits: like, doing moves in a different order and coming to the same gamestate
 MSmits: doesnt happen much in uttt
 Nerchio: do you guys have any idea why i time out in the arena and never in the ide
 IamTheSmix: hmm but it does for chess 
 MSmits: it does yes, but in chess you can also go back. Uttt is always progressive
 Hjax: theres different computers running the games Nerchio, maybe you are getting a slower one sometimes in the arena? 
 Hjax: i dont think theres any performance different for java between ide and arena 
 Nerchio: my turns are usually like 10 ms there shouldn't really be timeouts ;s
 MSmits: also ide runs without optimizations for some rlanguages
 IamTheSmix: does mini-max can lead to legend&#160;? 
 MSmits: sometimes optimization introduces bugs... it does in c++.
 MSmits: I should say: optimizations reveal bugs
 Hjax: i dont think theres any difference in optimization for java between ide and arena though 
 MSmits: probably not
 MSmits: rust has it though
 Hjax: rust is a neat language, i keep meaning to learn it 
 MSmits: Nerchio it might also be that the arena tests your bot against many different players and some play in such a way that causes timeouts
 Hjax: but then i decide to do C++ instead, get frustrated with C++, stop, and the cycle continues :D 
 MSmits: the timeouts might not be actual timeouts due to calctime, but an infinite loop somehow
 jacek: i did it! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/471751954">https://www.codingame.com/replay/471751954</a>
 jacek: darn reBless
 MSmits: first win or did you make a better bot?
 MSmits: better than re curse
 jacek: first win and probably last one
 MSmits: these NN's are ridiculously hard to beat
 MSmits: I spent many weeks tweaking eval
 jacek: got to tune the eval
 jacek: still cant get the mcts with ept working
 MSmits: my experience was that i would random rollout to depth 5 at first and slowly lowered it as the eval got better
 jacek: do you use eval directly or if eval &gt; 0 return 1 else return -1
 MSmits: there's different ways to do it, but for onitama and oware i set a maximum/minimum
 Nerchio: it says reading input takes 180 ms =/ is it possible that PR2 is an old game and is running different jvm than new games?
 MSmits: so, say the maximum is 10k, then i divide the score by 10k and cap it to -1/+1
 jacek: no tanh?
 MSmits: should i do that?
 jacek: sounds fancy
 MSmits: I didnt get this from some paper, tanh would probably be better
 MSmits: I should probably try that
 MSmits: the danger of capping is that when you're ahead, all moves will count as a win
 MSmits: but, that is what i am doing now
 jacek: thats my problem probably
 jacek: if locally eval says its win, all moves are win apparently
 MSmits: could be. I have a parameter for the cap and i just fitted it till it worked
 MSmits: the 10k i divide by
 MSmits: the reason it is so large is because then i can use integers for all the features i calculate
 MSmits: i am trying to google how to use the tanh, i remember seeing it in the context of training NN
 jrke: astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471753135">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471753135</a>&#160;;)
 jacek: tanh or sigmoid(eval) should give you percentage of winning.
 MSmits: sigmoid yeah, i found it
 jacek: though you should scale your eval. i.e. sigmoid(0.003*eval)
 IamTheSmix: you have choice sigmoid or ReLu
 MSmits: yeah, that scale parameter is what replaces my hard cap
 jacek: i.e. if you want being 10 seeds up should give 90%, scale accordingly
 MSmits: it's just a different parameter to fit
 jacek: if eval returns 0.1 do you backpropagate 0.1 and -0.9?
 jacek: or 0.1 and -0.1.
 MSmits: i have scores between -1 and 1
 MSmits: so 0,1 and -0,1
 MSmits: meaning the sigmoid needs to be shifted
 jacek: ahh right
 MSmits: i got that
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have a question about pr2
 MostComplicatedUsername: Does your hq start out owned by you?
 Hjax: yes
 MostComplicatedUsername: Hmmm
 MostComplicatedUsername: odd
 MSmits: would be weird if it didnt
 MostComplicatedUsername: true
 Hjax: you also get vision of your opponents hq on the first frame
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471754727">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471754727</a> This is happening tho
 Hjax: well, starting from the first frame 
 Hjax: so you can detect your opponents location 
 MostComplicatedUsername: I set my bot to move pods toward zones that arent mine
 MostComplicatedUsername: And that happened
 Nerchio: in private chat there is no pastebin automatic?
 MostComplicatedUsername: yep
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: just world chat
 MSmits: it's to protect vs spam mostly
 MostComplicatedUsername: msmits double negative = positive&#160;:)
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0e53e4e-e0c5-44b8-986d-e1b309634b7f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0e53e4e-e0c5-44b8-986d-e1b309634b7f</a>
 MSmits: yes, i am a positive person
 MostComplicatedUsername: No, I mean-
 MostComplicatedUsername: You answered his question with "No", meaning that
 MostComplicatedUsername: THere is pastebin in private chat
 jacek: we dont need no education!
 Nerchio: for anyone who has 1 minute and understands java, my last printline says 180ms sometimes and this is just reading input there is nothing there that can take that much time
 MostComplicatedUsername: jacek you just said that you do-
 IamTheSmix: I saw red discussion sometimes is it private&#160;? 
 IjustKilledutoo: hello guys i am back
 MSmits: jacek,  I am going to try to see if my oware bot is better with your sigmoid idea
 MostComplicatedUsername: IamTheSmix red means your name was mentioned
 MSmits: have to code it first
 MSmits: should not be too hard
 IamTheSmix: Ok okay thanks 
 Nerchio: guys timer starts when you read first input right?
 jacek: is this in while(true) loop?
 MSmits: float sigmoid = -1.0f + 2.0f/(1.0f + exp(SCORE_REDUCTION * evalScore));
 MSmits: is this correcT?
 Nerchio: yeah reading every turn jacek if you were asking me xD
 jacek: sounds like tanh
 jacek: which should be in math.h
 MSmits: hmm ok
 jacek: Nerchio well it starts timer before first input from server
 jacek: or this.startTime&#160;!= startTime?
 Nerchio: in some other challenge guys from chat told me to start the timer after first input
 Nerchio: just to make  sure it doesn't start during referee time or something
 MostComplicatedUsername: sigh... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471758653">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471758653</a>
 ganond0rf: for clash of code,  how do you get your ranking up :0
 MostComplicatedUsername: Win more
 MostComplicatedUsername: :D
 Qass: 와우 친구들
 Qass: 빡빡이 아저씨야~
 ganond0rf: it's based on a score right?
 ganond0rf: does the score go up every time you win?
 ganond0rf: does anybody know how it's calculated lol
 wlesavo: MSmits i also use tanh if i want a f(t) between 0 and 1, brillouin is also nice but  its kind of not a standart one
 Hjax: @ganond0rf yes it goes up when you win, i believe its similar to trueskill
 Hjax: it takes the rating of the people you played against into account 
 MSmits: wlesavo yeah it seems nice. Weird that I didn't think of it before
 MSmits: testing my sigmoid version on cg bench now
 Astrobytes: thanks jacek, now look what you've done :P
 MSmits: capping it between two values is really ugly
 MSmits: :grin:
 jacek: Astrobytes thats making it more challenging
 jacek: maybe i should show him my prune array
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: lol, absolutely
 jacek: and im finally top 10
 jacek: though barely above agade
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw, gj man
 MSmits: whats your prune array
 Astrobytes: An array of prunes
 MSmits: agade's bot is pretty strong
 MSmits: so thats cool
 jacek: used in cegimax
 MSmits: I had versions of my bot that won 70% vs robo and re curse, yet lost half vs agade... some RPS going on
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's params for you MSmits
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: I had weird values that kicked robos ass and no-one elses lol
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: this leads me to think an opening book would be really strong in oware
 MSmits: jacek, dont you have one?
 Astrobytes: iirc it was the 1 or 2 seed params for some weird reason
 Astrobytes: jacek has endgame book right?
 MSmits: seems hard to write those
 MSmits: game can end in so many ways
 Astrobytes: Yeah I was saying that the other day, not the best idea. Opening book would be more useful imo
 MSmits: I was thinking about end game books for checkers. It's really useless there
 MSmits: but they use them in real competitions
 MSmits: just too little codesize on CG
 MSmits: you can do it in bandas though
 Astrobytes: yeah, we play special CG versions  of games due to platform limitations
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: brb
 Astrobytes: k
 LelouchVC2: Not as true as our quality service since 1992
 jacek: i has opening book for oware
 jacek: it goes around 10-18 plies against you
 Astrobytes: Oh you do? And endgame too no?
 jacek: no endgame
 Astrobytes: I swear you said endgame, must've been someone else
 LelouchVC2: What is this? Chess?
 jacek: trictrac has endgame
 Astrobytes: Oware Abapa/Awalé
 LelouchVC2: oh
 Astrobytes: Might have been him, I've had a few Oware convos this past week or so
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think you're right jacek
 MSmits: cg bench is going well
 MSmits: and this is just my first guess for that parameter
 MSmits:   -- TOTAL --    GW=64,29%    [ W=52,38%   L=23,81%   D=23,81%  ] [42 games]
 MSmits: vs my arena version
 MSmits: so... thanks jacek&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Whatcha doing? tanh(evalScore)&#160;?
 MSmits: for now this: 
 MSmits: float sigmoid = -1.0f + 2.0f/(1.0f + exp(SCORE_REDUCTION * evalScore));
 MSmits: but its equivalent to tanh
 MSmits: i guess
 MSmits: tanh will maybe be faster
 Astrobytes: SCORE_REDUCTION&#160;?
 jacek: what have I done...
 MSmits: yeah because my eval has like 3k 
 MSmits: so has to be reduced
 Astrobytes: Ah OK gotcha
 MSmits: could be my new version is Rock vs my old versions Scissors
 MSmits: oware is like that
 MSmits: but the sigmoid thing can only be an improvement 
 MSmits: good news, i can also improve my Onitama bot with this
 jacek: x_X
 Astrobytes: rip everone
 Astrobytes: *everyone
 jacek: ban him before its too late
 Astrobytes: Hey MSmits, spoke briefly with Thiesjoo, says your an awesome teacher&#160;:+1:
 Marchete: by inviting euler or recurs3
 Marchete: ups
 MSmits: ah cool he is an awesome student though
 Marchete: nvm
 Marchete: old chat
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah, seems so MSmits!
 MSmits: next schoolyear i will only be teaching 11 50min classes a week or so
 MSmits: I get a reduction because of studies
 Astrobytes: Compared to how much right now?
 MSmits: 15, but I also have some other tasks besides teaching
 MSmits: basically it's a 30 hr a week job
 MSmits: 75% of full time
 Astrobytes: Cool, good you get a reduction for your studies and don't have to burn the candle at both ends too much
 MSmits: I teach 4 50 min classes of CS next schoolyear and the rest is physics or physics-adjacent
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i got a 20k scholarship basically
 MSmits: so i use most of the money for that
 MSmits: the work-reduction
 Astrobytes: That's pretty sweet"physics-adjacent" 
 Astrobytes: oops
 Astrobytes: "physics-adjacent" -&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah we have some subjects that are not called physics, but the stuff i do for that subject is basically physics
 MSmits: like a class about solar cells
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, specialised ones
 MSmits: or a class about astrophysics
 MSmits: yeah kinda
 Astrobytes: Gotcha
 MSmits: I have to do some design/research project next year and it's gonna be about teaching AI in CS
 MSmits: design teaching materials and research the effectiveness 
 MSmits: I am going to do something with machine learning too... Great excuse to dive into it myself
 Astrobytes: Nice! Do you need test subjects? CG might be useful
 MSmits: well, it's going to be Dutch mostly, but if I write any software, I'll share
 Astrobytes: As in for a population to study your teaching material effectiveness on
 MSmits: yeah, but my teaching material will be in Dutch mostly
 Astrobytes: Plenty Dutch on CG, sure they can put the word out for you
 MSmits: ah yeah, i can show it to counterbalance or something
 MSmits: might do that when the time comes,  I will work on some project over the summer first, probably will try alpha zero. Just to  do something practical with machine learning
 Astrobytes: Nice. God help us all :P
 MSmits: I doubt i will be making good bots with it. Robo is pretty good at stuff like this and he had most success with oware
 MSmits: failed on some other multis, at least compared to his usual success
 MSmits: i dont think it is easy
 Astrobytes: Yeah, doesn't suit every domain, or requires a different approach
 MSmits: I was thinking bandas might be good
 Astrobytes: I think Csipsirip (sp.&#160;?) is doing AlphaZero on Oware now too
 MSmits: oh nice
 Astrobytes: *Csipcsirip
 MSmits: I am imagining you doing bird noises
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: And Tiramon is working on NN with it too
 MSmits: it seems natural, considering the parameter hell
 MSmits: let the NN figure it out
 jacek: also its simple game for input and only 6 outputs
 MSmits: the depth of an alpha zero bot is crazy though
 MSmits: they have like 30+ layers
 RoboStac: the ones on cg don't
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: just because you cant do that or because the games are simpler?
 RoboStac: size limits
 MSmits: ah I see
 jacek: and computation
 Astrobytes: Tiramon was tring some DQN with PER
 MSmits: robo did you try training a bigger NN offline and test that?
 Astrobytes: woops, chat scroll
 jacek: google can afford that in minutes what normally takes years
 MSmits: i think the CG size limit actually helps you in this regard, with a lower NN complexity, you need less training
 jacek: but saturates quickier
 MSmits: your bot will be weaker, but google wont do any better either, if they have to squeeze it into a small size
 MSmits: right
 RoboStac: I'm not actually at the size limit on oware, smaller / faster was working better than using all available size
 jacek: TIL what  was doing was stochastic gradient descent, not gradient descent
 jacek: i was just too dumb for matrices
 MSmits: RoboStac I imagine it's hard to say anything definitive with so many degrees of freedom in using a zero isnt it?
 RoboStac: whereas my yavalath has had to be minified to fit
 MSmits: ah yes, much more input and output
 MSmits: more states
 MSmits: statespace
 MSmits: didn't you also do one for Bandas RoboStac?
 RoboStac: proper alphazero has a much more complicated network structure too, I'm just using simple dense / convolution layers
 MSmits: no residual?
 MSmits: and skipping layers
 RoboStac: oware/bandas/yava/breakthrough
 MSmits: and such
 RoboStac: no
 Astrobytes: Did you get around to using hexagonal convolution on yava?
 MSmits: I see
 RoboStac: yeah, yava is hexagonal conv
 Astrobytes: Nice.
 RoboStac: it worked much better once I got that working
 MSmits: hmm isn't it just a convolution NN that uses PUCT?
 MSmits: with policy and value both drawn from the network
 MSmits: seems more like halfa zero&#160;:)
 MSmits: using a zero as inspiration but turned into your own coctail
 RoboStac: yeah, you put inputs in and get a single score for that state and a policy score to guide the tree exploration for every child
 RoboStac: if you ignore all the internals between the inputs and outputs it exactly matches alphazero&#160;:)
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: well yeah
 jacek: roboZero
 Astrobytes: HalphaStac
 MSmits: Arena    GW=61,40%    [ W=51,75%   L=28,95%   D=19,30%  ] [114]
 MSmits: pretty sure the sigmoid works
 Astrobytes: Damn you jacek
 Hjax: are you only doing selfplay MSmits? 
 MSmits: before i wasn't with oware
 MSmits: i trained vs darkhorse, agade, recurse and robo
 MSmits: well trained as in, fit params
 MSmits: but shifting to a sigmoid doesnt require different opponents i think
 MSmits: like fitting an exploration parameter doesnt
 jacek: (should I tell him about texel tuning method for eval?)
 MSmits: it's a pretty strategy-neutral change
 Hjax: if you add enough params, it basically becomes a neural network anyway :P
 MSmits: feels a bit like that
 MSmits: texel tuning
 MSmits: googling
 jacek: :scream:
 Hjax: texel is a rather strong chess engine 
 Hjax: that optimized its parameters in a specific way 
 MSmits: i would like auto fitting. But selfplay wont work in oware
 MSmits: need opponents and thats a slow process with cg bench
 Hjax: convince top players to send you their code for science 
 Hjax: that will surely work 
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: you dont have your local 'arena'? without CG stuff?
 LelouchVC2: What works every time is just looking at nothing intensly, and when they turn to see what you're looking and you snap a shot of their code
 MSmits: I have one for 3 games, not for oware, because selfplay wasnt working to fit params
 MSmits: so i never bothered to write a local arena
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: did I?
 jacek: i know! download the replays of tops players and make NN learn their moves
 MSmits: ah no, i was working on a meta mcts for oware, not an arena
 MSmits: supervised learning?
 Astrobytes: I didn't finish my local arena for Oware
 MSmits: jacek btw, i do something weird in self-play for meta mcts
 MSmits: for efficiency, i let both players use the same search tree
 jacek: oO
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: so i dont have two instances of the game
 MSmits: of the bot i mean
 MSmits: just one bot playing moves from both perspectives
 MSmits: saving the tree between turns
 MSmits: that way i dont need two node pools and such
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: doesnt work when you are testign two different bots obviously
 MSmits: i am not 100% this doesnt introduce some kind of bias
 MSmits: but it worked so far
 appel: lmao ndc
 appel: i've not seen anyone this high of a level
 appel: we're fucked
 jacek:&#160;:?:
 appel: a lvl 31
 MSmits: where?
 Hjax: smits is level 34
 Hjax: assuming you are talking about profile level 
 appel: in our clash
 Hjax: ah 
 MSmits: I've never done a clash
 MSmits: and i would suck at it
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't miss anything
 MSmits: level doesnt mean that much
 Hjax: yeah level doesnt mean much
 Illedan: Clash is ok
 MSmits: except in eulerscheZahl's case
 MSmits: he can do everything
 eulerscheZahl: except nintendo
 jacek: even accept clash invitation!
 Hjax: yeah but euler is also rank 1 on the normal leaderboards 
 Hjax: which is far more relevant than his level 
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Oh hey "enulerschezahi"
 eulerscheZahl: the leaderboard for individual contests is what matters most to me
 MSmits: say it enough and it might throw automatonnn off the scent
 AutomatonNN: maybe i could have been that interesting
 eulerscheZahl: hey anstrobits
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i saw that wrong ping some hours ago. missed the trailing i though
 Astrobytes: I almost spat my coffee out, and I was on a phonecall at the time
 MSmits: allright gotta finish some work. TTYL
 jacek: dont forget to submit your bot
 appel: there aren't an infinite amount of challenges
 appel: the higher the level
 appel: the more chance they did it before
 appel: also the more experience so yeah...
 eulerscheZahl: you don't rank up in levels for clashing
 eulerscheZahl: so it's possible that a level 1 player knows (alomst) all problems
 eulerscheZahl: or a level30+ user barely knowing any
 eulerscheZahl: there is absolutely no correlation
 Illedan: Wow, I didn't even manage to win vs a crashing player in PR2 -.-
 Astrobytes: Not finished then Illedan? :smirk:
 Illedan: Just tested 1 tiny little thing :innocent:
 Astrobytes: :P
 Illedan: I saw a stupid loss vs wala
 appel: wait you don't get any experience for clashing
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 appel: thats stupid
 Astrobytes: Where did Nerchio's top 10 bot go?
 Illedan: Hiding!
 Astrobytes: lol
 Nerchio: i don't like to sit in one place
 Nerchio: so i submit whole day
 Nerchio: xD
 Astrobytes: Sima n has been creeping up slowly
 Nerchio: also i had problems with garbage collector =/
 Astrobytes: You use a pool? Allocate all resources on first turn?
 Nerchio: not really
 Astrobytes: JVM warmup issue?
 Nerchio: hard to say but it got better now after i called System.gc() first turn
 Nerchio: not sure if it does anything xD
 Illedan: Sure it does if you you do some precalc which uses a lot of objects
 Nerchio: yeah i did 160k objects first turn for path calculation :s
 Illedan: :P
 Nerchio: on the biggest map with 400 cells
 Illedan: Then it helps
 Astrobytes: calculate some dummy stuff first before your real stuff. And try without the gc
 Astrobytes: See if it helps
 Illedan: hmm, wonder if sneaky tactics helps on this one :thinking: hide a Pod in a corner and take all territory when enemy is not watching
 Nerchio: i thought about it but
 Nerchio: you need to get there somehow and you leave a trail
 Astrobytes: Sure I saw that in a replay, pod skulking around near a high value zone and then essentially flanking opponent and stealing the territory
 Nerchio: but maybe it's worth playing with some random single pods doing havoc :D
 Hjax: i was happy that my python bot was able to bfs the whole map on the first frame without timing out 
 Hjax: i didnt have high expectations 
 Nerchio: :D
 Astrobytes:&#160;:
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Hjax: usually i write my first bot in python and then rewrite in java 
 Hjax: but python has been fast enough for pr2 so far 
 Astrobytes: Considering PHP in top 10, you should be OK :P
 Hjax: is php slower than python somehow?
 Hjax: thats impressive 
 Astrobytes: I thought they were around the same or PHP was worse. Caveat: my PHP knwoledge is a little out of date 
 Astrobytes: *knowledge
 Astrobytes: I'm happy to be corrected if I'm wrong on that
 AbundantPuddle: Are you talking about runtime?
 inoryy: assuming it's purely language itself (e.g. no numpy), PHP should be faster afaik
 Astrobytes: Cool, thx inoryy
 Astrobytes: They've evidently improved it a lot in the last few years&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: What inoryy said. However, Python is still better. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 inoryy: yeah, they're even adding JIT to PHP8
 Astrobytes: I remember when python was a seldom used little scripting language and perl was king AbundantPuddle
 Astrobytes: Oh nice inoryy
 AbundantPuddle: I actually took asp in university so...
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 Astrobytes: Now if only they'd do something about the syntax :P
 inoryy: I think it's fine-ish; the stl API was a mess when I worked on it, I assume they've improved it
 inoryy: type system in PHP is much better than in python
 Astrobytes: Honestly been yonks since I worked with it. Maybe I should look into it again.
 jacek: yoink!
 Astrobytes: jacek "noun, informal British: a very long time"
 jacek: ooh
 inoryy: same for me, last line of PHP code I wrote was over 5 years ago; I hear about it from time to time when I meet (ex-)colleagues&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: My focus was in Java when I went to college for software development. On here, however, I've been trying to focus on Python. It is a very versatile language.
 Astrobytes: I think my last PHP was around 2008-9?
 inoryy: wow that's the dark ages
 Astrobytes: Yes. We called them that at the time.
 Astrobytes: I was only working with it informally but I was glad I had a good working knowledge of perl at the time
 Astrobytes: Made old PHP look like VB or something
 Astrobytes: And don't get me started on security issues
 inoryy: I think I was lucky enough to start right when PHP5.3 came out which was the first good patch
 Astrobytes: When off-the-shelf PHP CMS's became usable again :P
 Astrobytes: I think I did some updates around 2009-2010 but my memory is a bit sketchy
 IgorKoval: guys, is anyone here?
 Astrobytes: Nope. 
 IgorKoval: look, It says there was a failure, but the found value is the same as Expected, how is it possible?
 IgorKoval: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://prntscr.com/sw4luy">http://prntscr.com/sw4luy</a>
 Astrobytes: Been a looong time since  Idid that but you need either spaces or a newline, I forget
 IgorKoval: yea, I tried both of them but looks the same
 IgorKoval: you see that I have the right amount of spaces
 IgorKoval: and if I append \n it also does not help :S
 Astrobytes: Do you need a newline first? I honestly cannot remember
 IgorKoval: am I able to print while scanning?
 IgorKoval: or do I need to scann all and only then print?
 jacek: you can print to stderr
 IgorKoval: yes I can, thar what I did with L H and Msg
 IgorKoval: it is really wierd, because It says That it found the same as expected, but still is a failure xD
 IgorKoval: ok guys, thank you anyways
 IgorKoval: ok, I think the problem is that I can't print before scanning every argument
 Astrobytes: Ohhh yes you print debug to stderr
 Astrobytes: not to stdout, only print the answer to stdout
 Astrobytes: System.err.println(whatever);
 IgorKoval: yes, that's what I was doing, but that is for debug
 IgorKoval: for the answer I print to stdout
 IgorKoval: System.out.println(answer_string);
 IgorKoval: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://prntscr.com/sw4t57">http://prntscr.com/sw4t57</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh I see, yes, don't print to stdout until after you've read everything in
 IgorKoval: oh ok, I print only after reading everything?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 jacek: eeyup
 IgorKoval: ok, so I need to store the string
 IgorKoval: and print in the end
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 IgorKoval: hehe
 IgorKoval: thanks, I'll try
 IgorKoval: lol
 IgorKoval: still the same problem
 IgorKoval: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://prntscr.com/sw4usx">http://prntscr.com/sw4usx</a>
 eriko: elo
 IgorKoval: hey
 eriko: co tam Igor
 jacek: ohai
 IgorKoval: co tam? xD
 Astrobytes: It's like what's up/what's happening in Polish
 Astrobytes: like "wassup"
 IgorKoval: ah haha ok, I dont speak Polish xD
 Astrobytes: I don't either, just worked with a few guys :P
 IgorKoval: I'm fine, just a bit sad that the code is not being accepted xD
 IgorKoval: as they say, "the machine is always right"
 IgorKoval: it only does what we say to do
 jacek: AutomatonNN is that true?
 AutomatonNN: for now i want to see the code and i didn't even know that the end of the game
 IgorKoval: haha how he appeared here right after your comment xD
 Astrobytes: What do you think Automaton2000?
 jacek: AutomatonNN is addict
 Automaton2000: what do i do this?
 IgorKoval: hahaha
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a replay of your code and i can't see the result
 IgorKoval: is he a BOT? xD
 Astrobytes: AutomatonNN are you a bot?
 AutomatonNN: why do you think it's the best to get in the contest&#160;?
 Astrobytes: What about you Automaton2000, are you a bot?
 Automaton2000: except if you do it right
 IgorKoval: yes AutomatonNN is a bot, just answers random stuff xD
 struct: IgorKoval you are printing an extra soace
 HaZardous: hey everyone , im new her, hope youre having good day
 struct: space*
 struct: I think
 Astrobytes: I said that originally but where?
 Astrobytes: (well I said space or \n)
 IgorKoval: hmm I don't think so
 IgorKoval: he is asking for an extra space
 IgorKoval: if you see the quotes
 IgorKoval: it contains an extra space "### "
 IgorKoval: @struct thank you anyways for the review xD
 IgorKoval: hey HaZardous! ça va? 
 jacek: good good Astrobytes, keep pushing me up
 Astrobytes: fk off jacek :P :D I'm just testing some eval params
 HaZardous: @igorKoval what? im sprry i speak english and urdu
 HaZardous: sorry*
 IgorKoval: ahah it was just a joke, it means how are you in French xD
 Astrobytes: Be pulling you back down soon jacek :D
 jacek: evil params
 IgorKoval: what are you talking abou guys? Astrobytes
 HaZardous: oh im good :p, how you doing??
 Astrobytes: A multiplayer game IgorKoval, Oware Abapa
 IgorKoval: I'm fine to&#160;:) just thinking what's wrong with my code -.-
 HaZardous: haha arent we all
 Astrobytes: Nope. I know exactly what's wrong with mine.
 Astrobytes: It's s**t&#160;:)
 IgorKoval: haha I know that game Oware abapa
 HaZardous: oh here comes the bragger, haha good for you
 IgorKoval: hahah xD nice one
 Astrobytes: lol no, not bragging HaZardous, it's completely true
 IgorKoval: it is really wierd, it accepts the answer if I just hard coded, but if I print the variable with the same string it is not accepted -.-
 MostComplicatedUsername: My pr2 bot is now winning consistently against the ai
 HaZardous: im happy for you astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: IgorKoval stderr your hardcoded result, stderr your generated result and check the difference
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471787381">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471787381</a>
 Astrobytes: I'm not HaZardous, I'm losing!
 Astrobytes: :d
 Astrobytes: gj MCU&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: It's random movement unless there's a zone I don't control right next to it or the enemy's hq is right next to it
 IgorKoval: Astrobytes, I find no difference<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://prntscr.com/sw59er">http://prntscr.com/sw59er</a>
 IgorKoval: congrats MCU xD looks nice
 jacek: does the answer += "\n" make unnecessary new line for printLN?
 Astrobytes: aha
 IgorKoval: haha yes it does, but I print it all in one command
 jacek: but then you would print 2 new lines at the end instead of one, no?
 IgorKoval: yes, but it puts \n in the end of the string, so if you have a string like "potato\n apple" it will still have 2 lines, 
 jacek: what about "potato\n apple\n"
 IgorKoval: it will end up with 2 lines, and 2 emplty lines in the end
 IgorKoval: like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aa36621b-1e0f-4bab-a760-a0c12cd46d7b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aa36621b-1e0f-4bab-a760-a0c12cd46d7b</a>
 IgorKoval: oops xD
 jacek: ok
 IgorKoval: do you know if answer_string += String.valueOf(answer); affects the string?
 IgorKoval: I mean if it changes the characters in some different way xD
 jacek: what if you used new StringI(answer)
 IgorKoval: answer is an array of char
 IgorKoval: cannot be printed directly
 Astrobytes: valueOf can convert char array to string tho
 IgorKoval: yea, thats what I did
 Astrobytes: Sorry, doing about 4 things at once here&#160;:/
 IgorKoval: np
 Astrobytes: You can just paste your whole code if someone has time to go through it? 
 IgorKoval: sure, its not that long
 Illedan: PR2 froze again?&#160;:(
 IgorKoval: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b12fa62e-6f98-448d-82bb-f437d3d12734">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b12fa62e-6f98-448d-82bb-f437d3d12734</a>
 Astrobytes: Illedan, please do me a favour and confirm that in the debug channel on Discord, they don't seem to take it seriously
 Nerchio: I don't think you should Astrobytes
 Illedan: hm?
 Astrobytes: I shouldn't what Nerchio?
 Illedan: Works again now
 Nerchio: i think you were talking about pasting whole code :D
 Nerchio: thought*
 Astrobytes: Yes, just for ASCII Art
 Illedan: w00t, won re Curse on submit :tada:
 Astrobytes: Easy puzzle, we're helping him debug&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nice Illedan
 Nerchio: I didn't get a single game vs marchete or recurse yet ;pp
 Illedan: It's no fun
 Illedan: Straight into lose streak
 Nerchio:&#160;;(
 Illedan: Easy to beat re curse on small maps :D
 jacek: IgorKoval the string is length of 100 :o
 IgorKoval: hmm is that a problem?
 IgorKoval: I was just thinking abou that
 IgorKoval: -.- yes, it was accepted if I define the string as 4 lenght
 IgorKoval: so it means that it was copying the null characters too :S
 IgorKoval: thank you jacek
 Astrobytes: oh lol, I forgot to put your code inside the Solution class :facepalm:
 Astrobytes: Anyway, that's only gonna work for that one testcase
 IgorKoval: hahaha 
 IgorKoval: yea, I know, it was just a test code xD
 Astrobytes: Cool. 
 IgorKoval: now its progressing :P
 IgorKoval: thanks
 IgorKoval: done the first 3 cases
 Astrobytes: Thank jacek, I can't even paste code correctly :P :D
 IgorKoval: DONE&#160;:)
 IgorKoval: another 100%&#160;:)
 IgorKoval: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://prntscr.com/sw5q63">http://prntscr.com/sw5q63</a>
 IgorKoval: thank you guys
 IgorKoval: heres the code if you want to use it

 Astrobytes: No I did it already, just not in Java 
 Astrobytes: Congrats IgorKoval&#160;:)
 IgorKoval: do it in Java for another achievement :P
 Astrobytes: I try to do as little Java as I possibly can :P
 IgorKoval: thank you&#160;:)
 IgorKoval: why? you dont like java?
 Astrobytes: Hehe, not my thing no&#160;:)
 IgorKoval: what language you use?
 Astrobytes: C++ mostly, depends what I'm doing
 Astrobytes: I'm not getting into a "my language is better than yours" fight btw&#160;;)
 IgorKoval: I usually prefer C, but it have been a lot since I programmed in C so I forgot the rules about the pointers and some funcions
 IgorKoval: haha I'm not a programmer, so I have no opinion about the languages xD
 Astrobytes: Yeah I'm actually a biologist, not a programmer by trade
 IgorKoval: I like Java, and Python seems nice from my little experience
 IgorKoval: :O nice&#160;:)
 IgorKoval: so why do you need programming in biology? run simulations?
 Astrobytes: lol, well, there is bioinformatics which deals with that, but I don't do that. I'm assistant manager at my local wildlife conservation centre and I do pharmaceutical regulatory affairs part-time
 Astrobytes: CG &amp; programming is just a hobby these days
 inoryy: assistant to the manager*
 IgorKoval: hehe that's a nice hobbie :P
 Astrobytes: More of a case of manager to the designated manager inoryy (all industries are the same) 
 Astrobytes: Things are a bit messed up now though since the COVID outbreak
 inoryy: it was a reference to the best tv show of all times :P <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/6tQG15iM1UI">https://youtu.be/6tQG15iM1UI</a>
 Astrobytes: ohh, never watched the American series
 Astrobytes: Did you watch the UK series?
 inoryy: it's one of the rare cases where the remake is better
 Astrobytes: That's so *not* the UK opinion
 inoryy: yeah, re-watched both multiple times
 Astrobytes: lol, I'm not the biggest fan but I'll maybe give the US version a go
 Astrobytes: Working through Better Call Saul rn
 inoryy: I think if we go by S1 vs S1 then UK one is a bit better because the US one just tries to replicate it but the deadpan jokes don't land as well
 FriendlyFire: hey guys I have serious question 
 FriendlyFire: what the imax function excatly do&#160;?
 FriendlyFire: does*
 inoryy: but US series has the benefit of developing 
 FriendlyFire: help?
 Astrobytes: See that's what I worry about with the US ones, is that British humour is what makes The Office the Office (if you get me)
 inoryy: FriendlyFire can't answer without knowing more context, e.g. what language
 Astrobytes: Anyway, the best judge is the viewer so I'll give it a go at some point
 FriendlyFire: oh sorry C++
 Astrobytes: grrrrrr a leaderboard freeze when I'm right under jacek in Oware
 Astrobytes: One is not amused
 FriendlyFire: what 'imax' does jesus TELL ME
 DestroyTasmania: yo chill
 FriendlyFire: man I NEED TO KNOW MENTALY
 inoryy: well, it's not part of C++ STL so still missing context
 Astrobytes: imax? You're doing The Descent?
 FriendlyFire: yea
 inoryy: if I were to guess I'd say it casts vars to int and picks a max from there
 Astrobytes: There's a button to the left. Says 'Hints' on it or something. Read them.
 FriendlyFire: hmm makes sense
 FriendlyFire: at list that.. thanks man 
 Astrobytes: I mean *read*
 FriendlyFire: I read them but I didnt figure it out and I did
 Astrobytes: As in process it in your head and understand it. Otherwise you'll get nowhere.
 FriendlyFire: sure I will try it again tommerow
 Astrobytes: Cool. Don't give up.
 FriendlyFire: thanks yt
 FriendlyFire: by the way
 FriendlyFire: which language you learn or learned?
 Astrobytes: I mostly program in C++ but that's not relevant
 FriendlyFire: sure just curious bro
 Astrobytes: I can use a lot of languages depending what I need to get done
 Astrobytes: I'm not a dev btw
 FriendlyFire: why not
 FriendlyFire: you should
 Astrobytes: I already have 2 jobs! :D
 FriendlyFire: sounds great
 Astrobytes: It's not.
 FriendlyFire: hope to get a job it will keep me motivate to learn more
 FriendlyFire: why not
 Astrobytes: No, your motivation comes from you
 Astrobytes: Don't expect it from a job, you are your own master
 FriendlyFire: yea but if I have a "code enviroment" it will help me a lot
 FriendlyFire: to get better for my economy.. and life
 Astrobytes: Depends on the environment. Not all working environments are created equally&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Motivate yourself to learn and you'll go far
 FriendlyFire: yea I starting now with 20 min every day
 FriendlyFire: lol
 Astrobytes: Better than 0 minutes a day right?&#160;:)
 FriendlyFire: YEA
 FriendlyFire: thats the nice think when I start its easly comes to an hour lol
 Astrobytes: Shows you have interest. So learn and don't give up, every problem is an opportunity to learn - don't forget that one
 FriendlyFire: yea mistakes its good if you learn from it :sunglasses:
 Astrobytes: Yes, 100%I gotta go now, take care dude and good luck&#160;:)
 FriendlyFire: ok I go now bro add me I new here
 FriendlyFire: yt
 Nerchio: ranking stuck (
 JBM: time for moar tvc
 journeyvivek: hello
 journeyvivek: hello
 boom69: i really suck at coding 
 Crypticsy: hey the leader board for Spring Challege 2020 is bugged, i don't get any score after i submit neither does my score changes while the battles are working fine
 jrke: seems CG leaderboard stucked for a while not computing for PR2 and Bit runner also

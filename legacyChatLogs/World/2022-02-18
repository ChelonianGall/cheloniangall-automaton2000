 Uljahn: Automaton2000: morning
 antiwonto: [automated] Hey Uljahn, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 63 tacos
 Automaton2000: yeah, that's the one i know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [automated] PatrickMcGinnisII has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 31 taco. PatrickMcGinnisII now has 11 taco
 Automaton2000: hmm when you select the best node and repeat.
 Automaton2000: oh, you are still in the game is solved as a draw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg

 Plasma69: teach me hoe to code im 13 yrs old add me on discord  Doc Plasma#9146
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 hoe to code and how to manners
 Automaton2000: but how can i prove i'm not a java dev

 Uljahn: it stops if you refresh :disappointed:
 5DN1L: that's why i won't :P
 elderlybeginner: I cannot get promoted in Xmas, even though I'm above to boss. Any op here or should I use forum for that?
 5DN1L: You may have to ask CG[Thibaud]
 struct: I think this bug has been happening yeah
 axelmorf_98: Hello i am currently in college taking a java course and need help understanding some fundamental basics. Anyone willing to help out?
 Xascoria: So I was in the clash during the maintanence just now
 Xascoria: and
 Xascoria: I got last place because I got -2% score
 Xascoria: -2%
 Xascoria: negative
 Miki09: lol
 Xascoria: what this hell

 ETET: hello

 Fasader: hi
 derjack: struct i lied yesterday. i do use NN in chess
 struct: o.o
 derjack: but it isnt much it seems
 struct: how bad is it at end games?
 derjack: im not pro at chess to judge but id assume relatively bad
 struct: yeah doesnt seem great
 struct: For some replays
 struct: you give some free material
 derjack: but then again, the level is not so high to get into endgames :v
 struct: yeah your problem is not end games :p
 struct: still its only 50ms
 derjack: more like 40ms, the parsing somehow takes much time
 derjack: i need to give more margin in this game
 struct: train vs stockfish and limit stockfish to 1k&lt; nodes
 struct: you should still lose
 derjack: or, train on stockfish :thinking:
 struct: I think it can handle 960
 Idk.-_-: hey guys
 struct: hi
 Idk.-_-: this pointers is so confusing :D

 Idk.-_-: the result is will be same
 Idk.-_-: but why do i want to complicate my code and use pointers&#160;?
 struct: yes the pointer is pointing to the memory address of year
 Idk.-_-: i dont get it meaning
 abt8601: There are some other cases where you need to use pointers
 abt8601: Like dynamic allocation (malloc, free)
 abt8601: Or something like output parameters
 struct: and functions
 struct: for example ceil(float *f)
 struct: so it changes f
 struct: if it was a copy it would be useless unless you returned it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: new struct {}; // heh
 struct: maybe ceil is a bad example since it does not affect the variable but swap(int* a, int* b)
 struct: does affect the variables
 PatrickMcGinnisII: taco *cat=new taco();

 Wontonimo: here is the code if anyone interested <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/xqL4EQ9">https://tech.io/snippet/xqL4EQ9</a>
 Miki09: nice
 nulte: yes jacek onitama
 jacek: oh my
 nulte: im joking , now that my prototype is finished I can actually work on the bot
 nulte: My last submit was only tree reusee and I increased exploration factor by a bit
 jacek: nice
 nulte: I still dont understand how I should do EPT though
 nulte: sometimes player(0) - player(1)
 nulte: seem better
 nulte: other times
 nulte: player(0) &gt; player(1)&#160;? 1&#160;: -1;
 nulte: seem better
 jacek: scaling problem eh
 nulte: story of my life
 nulte: do you know any papers about ept?
 jacek: probably you know them already
 jacek: with bt and amazons

 jacek: though they use rollouts and just finish early with eval
 nulte: ty
 Wontonimo: do you run a/b tests on those two EPT per game&#160;?
 nulte: a/b tests?
 Wontonimo: brutal test player(0) - player(1) implementation vs player(0) &gt; player(1)&#160;? 1&#160;: -1; implementation
 struct: ah no
 jacek: like arena of 1000 games
 struct: only can use 2 threads for that
 struct: it will take me ages
 Wontonimo: how about just 100 games?
 Wontonimo: ages/10
 struct: I could try
 jacek: you can try 10ms instead of 50
 struct: I can also try minimax to fixed depth
 struct: maybe fixed depth not a good idea
 struct: since i probably can reach depth 12 on end easily
 struct: I will try the brutaltester
 struct: If I can manage to run the referee
 jacek: would minimax be good for ept results? it seems scaling/exploration problem
 struct: well the problem is I dont even know if my eval is good
 jacek: referee? you dont have your own 'arena' when you test your bots?
 struct: I dont test my bots
 Wontonimo: i've you've implemented the game you dont need the ref.  your own implementation can be the ref
 jacek: ^
 struct: My test is submit
 struct: my local test = number of sims
 struct: better = better bot :D
 Wontonimo: brutal tester will accept any program as the ref, in any lang that runs onn your computer
 mr.nomad: like what wontonimo said will work but remember one mess up can break it all together
 mr.nomad: but that's a rare case sometimes
 mr.nomad: so always recheck what you have coded down
 5DN1L: Any specific tips, mr.nomad?
 mr.nomad: don't mess up, that's my tip and i always tell myself that
 5DN1L: Are you going to solve any puzzles or join any bot programming arenas here?
 mr.nomad: eh, i'm good at coding but i have stuff to do, i try to help people and do the best i can here
 5DN1L: ohhhh riiiiight
 mr.nomad: i only help when i can, i don't hang around much here so i'l pretty much behind the coding
 struct: my secret is to never test the code then Ill have some "features" 
 mr.nomad: brb
 5DN1L: i still remember your loooooooong messages you left in this chat yesterday, mr.nomad
 5DN1L: Hope you level up a bit while you're here
 nulte: o.o
 struct: jacek your onitama is NN minimax?
 jacek: mcts ept
 struct: d = depth?
 jacek: minimax is so last century
 jacek: yes. but its very selective
 struct: max depth reached in the tree or on the move you are going to play?
 jacek: in tree
 jacek: bold of you to assume i dont troll there
 struct: well those depths are feasible
 struct: I think
 struct: I dont know how heavy your eval is
 jacek: this time im not trolling :O
 struct: let me see how deep mine goes
 nulte:&#160;????
 nulte: 81??
 nulte: ok i need to fix this
 jacek: thats deep
 nulte: Maybe I can increase exploration to fix this :p

 nulte: this is the bot that is in the arena
 nulte: :D
 jacek: how do you measure depth
 jacek: you add depths of each move? :v
 nulte: no
 nulte: wait yes?
 nulte: 1 move = 1 depth
 nulte: I measure it on select
 jacek: it should be max of the moves
 nulte: wdym?
 jacek: move 1 has depth 3, move 2 has depth 5, so it is d:5
 jacek: not 8
 nulte: so from root you have move 1 and move 2 right?
 jacek: yes
 nulte: ok one of the moves has that depth - 1
 nulte: not sure if its the one I played
 jacek: i dont store depth in moves. during selection i have current level. and saved max level. and i just do max level = max(max level, current level). so this is max depth of tree
 badsector: hi
 nulte: yeah
 nulte: thats what im doing
 jacek: phew
 jacek: hello
 nulte: max_depth = max(++depth, max_depth);
 jacek: but still 70 is too much
 nulte: yeah
 Fureot: yo
 nulte: and even worse since my eval is pretty bad
 nulte: I think it just go into these types of loops
 nulte: From the replay I showed
 nulte: Maybe if the state repeats I dont add that child or something
 BadBurger: does the codingame ide work with practice like vox codei2?
 5DN1L: what do you mean?
 struct: you mean to edit test cases?
 BadBurger: no, i mean, now i usually copy a round (state info) or 2 from console, and modify the default code to run locally, and then build the code on that, and then i try it on the browser and edit to work. but the codingame ide i saw a glimps on somewhere, you can locally run the test no?
 BadBurger: or do i have the wrong idea what the codingame ide is? 
 struct: I dont know anything like that for cg

 devnatiofra: Hi everyone&#160;! anyone can propose me a good website for optimisation of the rapidity of your code&#160;? I program in java (and I'm blocked in the puzzle "longest palindrome" when we must fin palindrom in 5000 char)
 StrideNYC: Did you try using a 2 pointer approach or just brute force?
 devnatiofra: brute force 
 StrideNYC: Two common solutions to solve for palindromes is comparing the reversed string with the original, or you can use a two pointer approach which only iterates half the length of the string.
 StrideNYC: i = to first indexj = to last indexif they are not equal return falseelse if you iterate completely return true.
 devnatiofra: aaa it's that
 StrideNYC: Is that a testcase? or did you say ahhh? lol
 devnatiofra: So first i've make the first solution, after reflexion i've make the second.. it's more optimized but no enough
 devnatiofra: no i say "aah" xD
 StrideNYC: lol. It still didn't pass?
 StrideNYC: Is this an exercise on this site? Can you link it.
 devnatiofra: yes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/longest-palindrome">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/longest-palindrome</a>
 StrideNYC: oh man. I misunderstood you lol..
 StrideNYC: this is for palindrome substrings lol
 StrideNYC: Sorry about that.
 devnatiofra: xDD no problem
 StrideNYC: I'll try it out and see what's up :p
 devnatiofra: Ok, ok good luck&#160;! :joy:
 StrideNYC: Use dynamic programming lol. The only way that I can think of solving this problem.
 devnatiofra: .. ok .. ok but I don't see how I can make my program more dynamic lol, I have like.. 5 if xD
 StrideNYC: Stop trolling me lol.
 devnatiofra: I don't troll you i'm just fucking dumb but ok I gonna stop disturb you x)
 antiwonto: [automated] devnatiofra be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 StrideNYC: ;x You've angered the gods. Tread carefully my friend lol.
 devnatiofra: Yes :sweat_smile::joy:
 Arctic_Ghost: hi
 Arctic_Ghost: hello?
 devnatiofra: Hi
 Arctic_Ghost: Hi
 devnatiofra: "Hi" is not a palindrome llamaoifejzozf
 devnatiofra: I'm gonna cry, gb xD
 Dren: just make a 2d grid to store a boolean table and make two pointers that loop through the string and fill it out
 Dren: I worded that pretty dumb but that should do it in O(n^2) space and time
 devnatiofra: I think understand what you say but I've already make the program that detect palindrome but if I make double loop.. in the case of the str have a length of 10 000, the loop turn 100 000 000 of time.. i've reduce to 50 000 000  but now that i've optimize how to find the palindromes, how to search the palindromes.. now I don't see how I can optimize the program 
 devnatiofra: and by the way, instead of call every time function like ".length()" in the loop, I put that in a variable to call this function just one time instead of call it 50 000 000 of time
 devnatiofra: sorry if you don't understand me, i'm french lol
 Pupper_Gump: It's also best to not use functions as conditions in for loops or while loops too
 StrideNYC: Damn that took a bit. Nice problem :p
 dalien: hello world! maybe someone knows the answer: is it possible to continue a failed clash of code (just for practice)&#160;?
 Dren: there is an euler site
 Dren: where you can find the clash
 Dren: don't have the link
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Dren :tacos:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Dren :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker has awarded Dren 10 tacos. Dren now has 10 taco. Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker now has 30 taco
 dalien: oh, thx for the info Dren, glad to know it even exists ahahwill have a look on that later
 Dren: yeah it's not easy to find through the site otherwise you could just pull up the solution during the clash
 Dren: oh nice tacos
 Dren: now I'm hungry
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: if russia invades your country, send us your womenfolk
 dmuraco: ^^^^^

 Automaton2000: but you still need to get this to work
 feuxclenoir: fuck nigars i love hitler, shut the fuck up bitches www.pornhub.com www.goku.com.
 feuxclenoir: nigars
 feuxclenoir: nigar
 feuxclenoir: fuck up
 5DN1L: banned
 Yuhiii: lmfao
 Yuhiii: how he can tell that here
 icyee: what no grass does to a man
 Yuhiii: it's so stupid
 shaau: lol
 Yuhiii: i'm 100% sure he is bad at all x)
 Ayza: love it when someone says every swear word in the dictionary randomly
 derjack: bloody hell
 Dickson: i love how they ban him but not remove the hateful message lol
 5DN1L: there isn't such a functionality...
 Dickson: they should add it then haha
 5DN1L: this chat is expected to be removed soon, so nope
 waterproofsodium: :O
 shaau: :scream:
 Ajaiy: that was unexpected
 TechTheAwesome: println!("Mamamia");
 5DN1L: That was expected as it was mentioned a few months ago, though at that time no specific timeframe was mentioned
 elie.f.asmar: So he was banned only from this chat or will he undergo disciplinary measures?  
 5DN1L: only from this chat
 Dickson: he will be punished by law
 elie.f.asmar: which law?
 TechTheAwesome: xD
 Dickson: footnote law
 TechTheAwesome: well an indefinite mute is harsh enough i think? 
 Dickson: no he should be executed 
 Dickson: like a program
 derjack: like Automaton2000
 TechTheAwesome: SEGFAULT
 Automaton2000: okay i think i was thinking of something else
 Dickson: can you not see the creator's answer to a clash of code?
 Ajaiy: jacek: The image is ready, will upload in 1 minute. Get ready to embrace it
 Ajaiy: Maybe I'll just wait until he/she responds or sth
 lulzsimp: maybe after you've attempted the clash of code
 lulzsimp: i havent tried
 TechTheAwesome: nah there's no creator's answer, but anyone who join the clash can decide to show their own Dickson
 TechTheAwesome: i guess seeing the correct answer just in case everyone else fails is a good feature
 TechTheAwesome: but for now im pretty sure we don't have it
 Dickson: ok I see, thanks for the reply @techtheawesome
 Ajaiy: jacek: Are you online?
 DomiKo: he isn't
 Tbalta: ez
 DomiKo: but maybe I can help you :D
 Ajaiy: No, it's not for help
 DomiKo: ohh ok
 derjack: what for
 derjack: is this rick roll avatar?
 Sephirious: Hi
 Sephirious: I have a question that I hope someone knows the answer."If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero "
 Sephirious: How can I achieve this rule&#160;?
 5DN1L: Have you tried anything?
 Sephirious: My code can find the answers and etc.
 derjack: if you have -5 and 5, then print 5
 Sephirious: But output says -5 is smallerthan 5
 Sephirious: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures</a>
 Sephirious: This is the question
 Sephirious: I need to get output with negatives
 Sephirious: If I convert them into positive
 Sephirious: Thats not correct
 5DN1L: you may use another variable to store it if that helps
 5DN1L: or test it using another conditional statement
 Sephirious: Let me try thank you
 5DN1L: np
 JystoDussPipouPrime: hey&#160;! when a clash finish, you can't continue it&#160;?
 5DN1L: you can't
 JystoDussPipouPrime: Sadge
 Wild_Python: (python question)
 Wild_Python: what is the diffence of chr() and ord()
 5DN1L: chr: input is ascii value, output is character
 5DN1L: ord: input is character, output is ascii value
 Wild_Python: oh
 nicola: They are opposites.
 nicola: Reciprocal.

 Automaton2000: i want to do that?
 wetones: why dont i get a taco?
 struct: :taco: wetones
 antiwonto: [auto] struct has awarded wetones 1 tacos. wetones now has 1 taco. struct now has 59 taco
 jacek: so generous
 Ajaiy: jacek: The image is done
 Ajaiy: do you want to see it?
 wetones: thanks bro
 jacek: eeyup
 Ajaiy: ok
 Ajaiy: done
 Ajaiy: you can refresh your screen
 jacek: oh my, its beautiful
 Ajaiy: It took time in pixel art
 Ajaiy: And apparently I also rickroll everyone when I type
 jacek: :tada:
 Ajaiy: I guess I will change it every month or sth
 Brawler_zx: I am afraid to ask how for "And apparently I also rickroll everyone when I type"
 jacek: he changed his avatar. you need to refresh page
 struct: just dont refresh ever
 Agui14: no
 Ajaiy: lol
 Ajaiy: but restarting your computer also works
 Sunnyyy: hey
 Agui14: hey
 Brawler_zx: restarting works but deleting system32 legendary

 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 Baskarapandi: hi
 Wontonimo: hello other real humans like me
 Wontonimo: hey jacek, did you read the super long discord msg I sent you? 
 jacek: yes
 Wontonimo: after I wrote it, I got the feeling I was way off and you already do that
 jacek: im still digesting it
 Wontonimo: ah
 jacek: yes
 Wontonimo: it was a little long
 jacek: i do that in my code
 jacek: but cant get it working using nn libs
 Wontonimo: i wouldn't try doing that with nn libs
 Wontonimo: during learning
 Wontonimo: the backprop won't work particularly well
 Wontonimo: oh, you could do it with an embedding layer and a fixed number of input positions
 Wontonimo: you want me to code something up on tensorflow for you?
 jacek: no need, im not that desperate yet ~
 jacek: i want to try to learn it by making
 Wontonimo: for the backprop, I'd use the whole matrix.  for prediction the addition/subtraction of rows is for speed
 Westicles: discord msg?  ew yuck
 Wontonimo: if you were using tensorflow, you can use a one-hot + embedding layer to dynamically choose which rows to inject into the network
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather">https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather</a>

 jacek: like the one in checkers code
 struct: these seem like avx operations
 jacek: in the morning there was guy planning on making NN for spider attack
 jacek: did he succeed?
 Wontonimo: j4at ... let's look at the leaderboard ... just a sec
 Wontonimo: he is still in the same place as yesterday
 struct: If I could do a NN that would probably be the last game I would try
 jacek: oh my
 j4at: hehe
 jacek: yeah, onitama is more obvious choice for NN
 Wontonimo: HEY j4at&#160;!! :wave:
 Wontonimo: how's it going on the NN&#160;?
 j4at: Didn't work on it today.&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: what does your local off-line learning setup look like?  Is it brutaltester generating data + DB to store + tensorflow/pytorch to turn data into learning&#160;?
 Ajaiy: What does NN mean though?
 Wontonimo: or is it all online learning ... and if so how do you store versions etc
 Wontonimo: NN
 Wontonimo: what is NN
 Wontonimo: where is antiwonto when you need it
 Wontonimo: NN = Neural NEt\
 jacek: eat :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 j4at: training script - &gt; opens brutal testers -&gt; opens client.py -&gt; uses sockets to communicate with the training script
 Wontonimo: and is it online learning only or is there also experience replay or something else?
 jacek: i bet most rl libs have replay buffer and/or target network by default
 j4at: yeah it has replay memory but its pretty simple it stores last n states
 j4at: there is some tricks that can be added but i'm too lazy
 Wontonimo: says the guy who is creating 2 actors, 2 critics, and using state-of-the-art transformer network
 Wontonimo: i don't think you can even say you are lazy. prioritizing your time maybe, not lazy
 Wontonimo: I hope you destroy everyone in spider attack then write up a nice playground at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a> to teach us all how to do it
 Ajaiy: Co-op 100%
 jacek: will it learn triple wind
 j4at: I hope so
 jacek: or will it exploit bugs like those hiders and seekers game bots
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/Lu56xVlZ40M?t=129">https://youtu.be/Lu56xVlZ40M?t=129</a>
 Ajaiy: Yeah i've seen that video
 Ajaiy: the AI just beats the system
 Ajaiy: Maybe in Spring Challenge you can control the other heros to do a triple wind or sth?
 struct: I dont think that would work at all
 Wontonimo: building a buggy game is poor programming, not a cause for celebration that an AI found an exploit
 Wontonimo: I call that "marketing spin" not breakthrough tech.
 jacek: why making unit tests when you can make ai to find bugs
 1C0D3R: the devs didnt even know that bug existed
 1C0D3R: ye exactly
 1C0D3R: later there will probaly be AI testing bugs, asuming AI's arent the only game makers then
 Wontonimo: also, it's been well documented that machine learning will exploit bugs, so nothing new there either.
 jacek: gib me more computation power
 struct: just make your code faster
 j4at: jacek you might want to use vast.io it's the cheapest website to rent gpus
 j4at: gpus server*
 jacek: you use it?
 j4at: yes
 j4at: only for production tho, i do testing on my own computer
 dot.nick: someone join event clash&#160;:( its just bots here
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey dot.nick, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 2 tacos
 dot.nick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/241259682d2d8682a9e20e417004eeb03a25dce">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/241259682d2d8682a9e20e417004eeb03a25dce</a>
 antiwonto: [auto] hey dot.nick dont paste those links here.  Use the channel #clash
 zakacat: Give :taco: antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry but you can only award tacos once per day
 zakacat: ur loss
 j4at: That's a honest working bot. It doesn't accept bribe.

 LeJordy: hello 
 LeJordy: there
 LeJordy: your mother btw
 LeJordy: goodbye
 BrandoCalderon: question, im coming around by the game
 BrandoCalderon: and I noticed when I played CoC that JavaScript it's the only programming language to clash
 BrandoCalderon: Can someone tellme what's going on?
 Wontonimo: oh my, there are other languages other than javascript?
 Wontonimo: jk, yeah, you can pick any of languages you want
 Wontonimo: even php
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII :money_mouth:</b>
 Westicles: he means in the event
 Westicles: only one language is allowed
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: &lt;loop&gt; not me &lt;/loop&gt; Wontonimo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: +":taco:"
 Wontonimo: oh, interesting.  A language specific clash of code schedule
 Wontonimo: next one is in 18 min and is shortest C
 Wontonimo: will that actually get more users?
 j4at: Wontonimo how to remove the timeout from  brutaltester&#160;?
 j4at: \spider attack
 j4at: I found this "gameManager.setTurnMaxTime(50);"
 j4at: but changing the value doesn't really change anything
 Wontonimo: why do you want to do this?
 j4at: because my AI is slow :3
 Wontonimo: right
 Wontonimo: honestly, I don't know
 Wontonimo: I havent ever tried
 Wontonimo: it shouldn't be too difficult.  i bet it is in the spider attack code, nto the brutal tester code
 Wontonimo: anyone else know?  struct , PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;?
 j4at: "gameManager.setTurnMaxTime(50);" is in spider attack
 j4at: changed it but still getting timeout error
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 bobth: where  is the language specific CoC event
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I didn't do it for spiders, I'm looking tho
 j4at: My training script waits for the 2 players to get inputs. Maybe that's why&#160;? Should it get like inputs from first player that players send an action and then do smae with player 2&#160;?
 j4at: Should it get like inputs from first player than player 1 sends an action and then do the same with player 2&#160;?*
 j4at: then*
 j4at: I'm sleepy I will just finish it tomorrow
 Wontonimo: it's one then the other.  they are not synchronous
 Wontonimo: they are serial
 j4at: that's explains xhy
 j4at: why*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I had issues with the pattern matcher barfing on my input
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the log file should tell you what it barfed on,  i think it just deactivates player, then the gamemanager shows a winner
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: referee.java line 120  gameManager.setTurnMaxTime(50);
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 102
 j4at: Yeah I already tried that. The problem is not from that timeout i found out. Its just from my training script. It also timeout due to the 2000ms timeout in the start  that's why increacsing the 50ms didn't change anything.
 j4at: Fixed now&#160;;)
 j4at: Thank you anyways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try training an NN for clash of bots, I'm trying...but I'm new at it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it should be perfect for it actually
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I put the 5x5 input matrix into a 50bit int
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and there's only 10 possible outputs for each bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so decisions aren't really fuzzy, they are fairly finite
 Wontonimo: good luck&#160;!
 Wontonimo: how are you training it?
 j4at: yeah that seems a lot easier than spider attack
 PatrickMcGinnisII: game doesn't give you any immediate feedback like HP and stuff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm trying to figure out how many botstates I actually need to store
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so not therre yet
 j4at: Are using RL?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: max is currently 70Billion
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reinforced, yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: using my own conpression techniques I can get just about 1% of that, lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, maybe it's just over .1%
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so I figure, i can write early game avoidance movements... and late game should use the library I end up with
 PatrickMcGinnisII: library should only need to be about 40Mb (uncompressed) ... how to get it under 80k, ihnfi
 j4at: damn that's a lot
 j4at: My sipder attack NN has +1m float16 weights.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, can almost weight every pixel on the board
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did  a heatmap with the random spider spawn + movement... didn't show me anything i already didn't know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so GL
 j4at: thank you&#160;;)
 ShadoDrago: how do I use code I am a bot
 j4at: My NN has 12.5 million float16 parameters actually that's more than I thought&#160;:( If i remove 1 trick It will become 2m instead without really lowering size of the NN. And If i lower the size a little it will become 900k. That should be enought after compression but it will lower the quality of my NN alot.
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey j4at, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 6 tacos
 LinhT.Nguyen: hi
 LinhT.Nguyen: hi
 LinhT.Nguyen:&#160;:
 LinhT.Nguyen:  :taco: 
 antiwonto: [auto] ':taco:' was defined as ' A currency to some, sustenance for others '
 PatrickMcGinnisII: j4at can u remove the high bit w/o performace loss?
 j4at: Even if i can that's like 1/16 compression
 j4at: 15/16*
 j4at: I'm starting to give up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's also line length limits, i think it's 1k chunks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the real experts on shoe horning data into CG is def. not me
 jacek: i do 1 weight 1 char, with reduced resolution
 jacek: so realistically you can get to around 80k weights
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can get base53 conversion and then LZ into 999 char chunks, and reverse at startup ... but i know there's better ways depending on lang.
 j4at: what is a realistic compression ratio that i can achieve&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think it's 20MB to 90k...but I've only gotten like 5MB to 40k, whatever that is
 jacek: oO
 j4at: damn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek knows the ratios
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My libs aren't all that when i use 'em
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ratio really depends on how differentiated it is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think NN data is fairly dense ... so I'd guess 30 to 1...what u think jacek?
 jacek: you mean you can get 2m weights into 100k code?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: weights...no... sparse sets...sure
 jacek: ahh. yeah
 j4at: That will be a lot of work and I doubt that sparse sets will be that helpful in my case.
 j4at: I will give up. I will train my 12.5m model and then train a smaller model to simulate the big one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow research on compression algorithms on dense sets...the ratios are horrible
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like max 4 to1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my kung fu is no good, soft woods
 PatrickMcGinnisII: opening books are so different than NN

 Kepe55: I'm trying to visualize the "folding a note" problem but at 4+ letters its hard imagining it
 Kepe55: Any advice?
 Kepe55: I'm having a hard time coming up with an algorithm for it
 Uljahn: don't give up, develop your imagination or use real paper
 Kepe55: ok thx
 martinpapa69: solved -1solved 1solved -1solved -1
 martinpapa69: my solver is buggy :dizzy_face:
 Kepe55: Editorials would be great 
 Kepe55: Where they give hints or something
 Uljahn: Kepe55: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-folding-paper">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-folding-paper</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a forum?! :scream:
 Kepe55: Thats a similar problem, thanks
 Uljahn: oops my bad
 Kepe55: no, its almost the same
 Kepe55: but a bit easier I think, so if I solve that it might get me enough practice so I can solve Folding a note
 Kepe55: thanks
 Kepe55: nvm I will just continue solving easy puzzles and then come back to this
 Mr.Moxy: is there a way for the codingame IDE to print everything and not just the first line or first print?
 Periapsis: it depends on the language I think, but python 3 lets you do print(something, sys.stderr) and it prints but it doesn't count as part of the solution
 kjj090: no there isn't,you have to manually do it. in python3 for example you can do error=lambda *m:print(*m,file=sys.stderr,flush=True) and you can call error to debug something

 Pixa123: Hey, does anyone else having problems with "Enter" on PHP language&#160;?
 borrel: @Pixa123 Yes
 Pixa123: still not working&#160;:(
 UnidentifiedX: say a character is encoded using '56x0', what type of format is this?

 Matilda-bit: in clash of code 'A contribution by The_ZimaBlue'  'enter' is not working for PHP language
 Pixa123: Pixa123 02:17PMHey, does anyone else having problems with "Enter" on PHP language&#160;?
 Juanmv94: What do you mean with enter? PHP_EOL?
 Pixa123: it is through whole page, not only clash of code
 Matilda-bit: no on keyboard it is not work only for PHP 
 Matilda-bit: for another language it is work!
 Pixa123: meaning, when you press Enter to create new row in IDE
 Matilda-bit: yes yes
 Juanmv94: mmm... it works for me
 Matilda-bit: hmmm
 Pixa123: on PHP language&#160;?
 Matilda-bit: yup
 Matilda-bit: yep
 Pixa123: i'm asking @Juanmv94
 Astrobytes: works fine. Did you change something in your IDE settings?
 Pixa123: no, tried on different browsers
 Astrobytes: I cannot reproduce it on my end I'm afraid.
 eulerscheZahl: then give them a visit and try on their end
 Astrobytes: Excellent idea euler
 Pixa123: Unexpected error TypeError: Cannot create property 'lastIndex' on string
 Pixa123: this is the erroor in console
 Pixa123: Unexpected error TypeError: Cannot create property 'lastIndex' on string '^\s*\/\*\*(?!\/)([^\*]|\*(?!\/))*$'
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still not sure if i should try that yare contest or not&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: What's that got to do with the Enter key?
 Pixa123: when i press Enter i got that error
 eulerscheZahl: which puzzle and current IDE code?
 Pixa123: tools.js:214 Unexpected error TypeError: Cannot create property 'lastIndex' on string '^\s*\/\*\*(?!\/)([^\*]|\*(?!\/))*$'
 Pixa123: horse-racing-duals
 eulerscheZahl: share your full code please
 Pixa123: IDE code?
 eulerscheZahl: might be some syntax highlighting that's broken
 Astrobytes: sounds like it
 eulerscheZahl: yes, IDE code that you typed

 eulerscheZahl: indeed: no new line possible
 Illedan: Yo
 Astrobytes: confirmed
 Astrobytes: Hi Ille
 Pixa123: lol thanks, was getting frustrated&#160;:)
 Illedan: Zup?
 Astrobytes: Not a lot, other than this weird bug 
 Illedan: What game?
 Astrobytes: Horse-racing Duals, for some reason the Enter key doesn't work in the IDE for PHP
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: anyway, off for my second vaccine shot. brb later
 Illedan: ^^
 Illedan: And more FB spamming
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: later, enjoy&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Hm, seems to be all puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: good luck Illedan. the 2nd one knocked me out for 2-3 days
 eulerscheZahl: even space maze is affected. that's where I draw the line. Bug report incoming!
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: It's puzzles, multi,s, optim and golf. Everywhere.
 eulerscheZahl: reported. let's see how long it takes. Thanks for the info Pixa123
 TimothyAlexisVass: Is there a way in Python to loop through inputs?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. with the standard python ways to read from stdin
 TimothyAlexisVass: in JavaScript you can do:while(s=readline())
 eulerscheZahl: just usewhile True:and let it timeout?
 eulerscheZahl: the lazy solution
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.app/?q=python+iterate+input">https://lmgtfy.app/?q=python+iterate+input</a>
 TimothyAlexisVass: I actually need to print after the loop though&#160;:(
 Uljahn: while(s:=input()): :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: do you even have to read all input in this case?
 eulerscheZahl: golfing?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yeah, I'm trying to get this without using the "number of lines" variable to save some size&#160;:)
 IndecisionTree: Why do some clashes give a 404 error when trying to "test in ide"?
 TimothyAlexisVass: This was what I submitted: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1140d806-af3c-4dbf-8f1a-99a1f79f6db8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1140d806-af3c-4dbf-8f1a-99a1f79f6db8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: because they were modified by a bot (e.g. reverse mode disabled because of bad user feedback)
 eulerscheZahl: that bot creates a new puzzle revision and someone forgot to make that IDE-openable
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling that I just made up a new word
 IndecisionTree: ah ok. That makes sense. Thank you :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: of course it can be shortened TimothyAlexisVass
 eulerscheZahl: exec(bytes('㵩湩異ੴⱬⱮ㵡⡩Ⱙ湩⡴⡩⤩〬昊牯猠椠⁮慲杮⡥⥮਺愠㴫⡩⸩潣湵⡴⥬瀊楲瑮愨 ','u16')[2:])

 Uljahn: for s in " "*n:
 Uljahn: also i(a) instead of print(a)
 eulerscheZahl: and the a+= in the same line as the loop
 TimothyAlexisVass: I'm thinking it could be done without using the n at all, that would remove the need for n=int(i())
 eulerscheZahl: i like the i(a) idea btw Uljahn
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yeah that's really smart
 TimothyAlexisVass: Uljahn++ :D
 eulerscheZahl: Uljahn += 1
 Wontonimo: the first time i saw that shortening in CoC I thought it was Mandarin 
 eulerscheZahl: because it's python
 RoboStac: dump the loop entirely
 RoboStac: print(sum(i().count(l) for s in ""*n))
 eulerscheZahl: you forgot the space in your string
 RoboStac: ah yeah
 cbodin: im learning python 3, havent done coding before. and am struffling with this command check point angle for coders strike back
 TimothyAlexisVass: Like this?input=ii(sum(i().count(l) for s in " "*n))
 cbodin: struggling
 Wontonimo: hey cbodin, what are you struggling with?
 eulerscheZahl: now you don't have the n defined
 RoboStac: you'd still need the line that reads l,n,a 
 eulerscheZahl: no a
 eulerscheZahl: a is the sum
 TimothyAlexisVass: ofcourse
 cbodin: finding the correct python 3 code for coders strike back  check point angle
 Wontonimo: i can help you with that
 Uljahn: cbodin: coders strike back is a fancy place to learn python from scratch
 Wontonimo: i'll DM you
 Astrobytes: Use TeamViewer :P
 Wontonimo: what is TeamViewer?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i was just thinking "DM sounds like what MK would do" :D
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Remote desktop software, old MK meme :D
 eulerscheZahl: once I changed my nick + profile pic (contest themed)
 eulerscheZahl: to told me to play CSB and kept sending me private messages for maybe 20 min
 Astrobytes: lol, he started messaging you, I remember
 eulerscheZahl: then I got bored and told him I've just reached legend
 eulerscheZahl: good times
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 RoboStac: TimothyAlexisVass - is l a single character?
 Wontonimo: I did that or MK&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a lower case L
 RoboStac: no, as in what it reads
 eulerscheZahl: oh right
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: MK of course!
 RoboStac: wondering if you can drop the " " and reuse l there
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Even the very mention of CSB brings back MK memories for a lot of us
 eulerscheZahl: i remember why i'm bad at golfing
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/xp7yK6x">https://imgur.com/a/xp7yK6x</a>found it again
 eulerscheZahl: imgur now shows me a video ad before I can upload&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: lol, that was a funny afternoon
 eulerscheZahl: and you got the most correct guesses
 eulerscheZahl: looking for the nickname that's missing or how did you do it?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Not sure, I think I'm just good at recognising common phrases from particular people. Or was, not so much now.
 TimothyAlexisVass: How about this one?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Sum alphabetical index of characters in string...
 TimothyAlexisVass: print(sum(ord(s.upper())-64 for s in input()))
 TimothyAlexisVass: any tricks?&#160;:)
 Westicles: I miss MK DMing his theories on brain function and consciousness 
 KiwiTae: he stopped DMing you&#160;? oh
 kjj090: TimothyAlexisVass there is sum(s.encode())-64*len(s) assuming s only consists of upper chars
 Westicles: Something about your brain is too quick, and starts formulating a response before the inputs are done.  So you get stuck in suboptimal patterns
 Astrobytes: That's pretty accurate in terms of perception. If you think of the inputs the brain is bombarded with, it has to construct some formulation of it all to begin to make sense of it. The ultimate predictive engine.
 Astrobytes: This is where you get into that nature of 'reality'.
 Astrobytes: *the
 Westicles: I don't think he got around to giving any fixes, so I am still running around in automaton mode

 anuragr135: Hi
 anuragr135: brozz
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well, since yesterday the online IDE stopped working... can't hit &lt;enter&gt;, can't add any lines&#160;!!!!!!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Firefox
 BlaiseEbuth: Who needs lines...
 Illedan: yeah euler :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I stopped using waterfox a few months ago... now I can't use firefox either.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;enter&gt; works in chat
 BlaiseEbuth: Who use site's IDE...
 Illedan: Me when I'm lazy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So, is chrome the only browser now that will function correctly?
 BlaiseEbuth: IDE works fin in FF for me...
 BlaiseEbuth: *fine
 RoboStac: I think it's something wrong with php in the ide rather than browser
 RoboStac: there was a discussion / reports about it earlier
 BlaiseEbuth: Who use php...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, C++ &lt;enter&gt; works in editor 
 Astrobytes: It's currently a site-wide IDE issue affecting PHP PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: Staff are aware.
 BlaiseEbuth: Try to put a $ beffore hitting enter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, no Space Shooter for me today i guess
 Astrobytes: It's the IDE telling you to use C

 PatrickMcGinnisII: cut/paste carriage returns works, but I'm not that dense
 Illedan: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, keybindings also have unexpected behavior
 Illedan: I did such thing during COTC. Bought a keyboard for an Ipad to code during vacation and had to Copy paste some keys I didn't find
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ctrl+enter should be an insert line, it hits play...wierd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ctrl+c,v,z work

 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't find the bug in the forums
 BlaiseEbuth: Who use the forum...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well where's the bug reporting?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: discord?
 Illedan: ye

 Illedan: wtf
 Astrobytes: c'mon man, wouldn't be CG if that didn't happen&#160;:)
 jacek: start fixing bugs in twitter
 Illedan:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: eyup
 AllYourTrees: jacek_ two questions while you are here:1. do you use dirichlet noise while training?2. what do you use for value target? Q value/game outcome/some interpolation?
 AllYourTrees: :spy:
 AllYourTrees: at first i was using noise, but then found i could disable it and thing sstill worked
 AllYourTrees: and ive been using an interpolation of Q value and game outcome, but my value reported in CG seems to swing wildly, so wondering if i should do something else...
 AllYourTrees: oh wait you don't do policy so you don't have to do with noise... yet another reason to not do policy :D
 jacek: eeyup, no policy
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 jacek: but during training for final move i use softmax with some temperature
 jacek: so the worse moves can be chosen accordingly sometimes
 AllYourTrees: okay ya i have something similar
 jacek: and the target value is the root's value
 jacek: not game outcome
 AllYourTrees: huh okay thats great to know
 BigFishOutOfWater: BlaiseEbuth, if I remember correctly, you had gotten an answer about how the BOOST works exactly. Could you please remind me?
 AllYourTrees: :raised_hands:
 AllYourTrees: ty for sharing!
 BlaiseEbuth: BOOST?
 martinpapa69: target value=root value? interesting
 BigFishOutOfWater: Maybe it was someone else. The pod racer game gives you a boost but they don't tell you the numbers for it.
 Astrobytes: 650 instead of 100
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh.
 BigFishOutOfWater: thank you very much
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes is a moderator of type 2 in Chomsky Hierarchy.
 jacek: doesnt marchete use combination of game outcome and root value?
 Astrobytes: lol BlaiseEbuth
 martinpapa69: no idea, i moved from his code long ago
 AllYourTrees: ive been using iterpolation between game outcome and root value based on turn # for the longest time
 AllYourTrees: but gonna try root value next
 martinpapa69: have you also tried only using game outcome&#160;?
 jacek: i was experimenting recently with that, but in supervised fashion. that is i created millions of positions from self-games and used only outcome. i had some successes with it in breakthrough
 martinpapa69: I've never tried anything, but the outcome
 jacek: was it at least decayed?
 martinpapa69: -1;1
 jacek: no multiply by 0.99 ^ (turns left)?
 martinpapa69: nop
 martinpapa69: I saw marchete used some decay
 martinpapa69: but i didnt like that
 martinpapa69: I think using raw outcome adds some noise to the training, so even if its not accurate every time, it could help the training 
 martinpapa69: but thats just my theory, never made measurements
 jacek: theory fails. need experiments
 martinpapa69: true, i just dont like the "handcrafting" part of the development, im more interested in the algorithms
 KalamariKing: how some people #2,509,175th

 Mohammed_Galal: Hello
 Mohammed_Galal: this website is fun 
 jacek: :tada:
 Kepe55: solving problems can be a pain for me but it makes me improve I think
 Mohammed_Galal: yeah it makes you improve buddy
 KalamariKing: Astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/L9WnNa9">https://imgur.com/L9WnNa9</a>
 KalamariKing: 2.5 millionth place
 jacek: even if you dont solve the problem, the trying is important
 Astrobytes: KalamariKing: OK I see what you mean now, formulate your sentences a little better for chat&#160;;)Yeah, this person hasn't achieved much in the way of codinpoints or XP so... back of the list
 Astrobytes: Probably inactive, or rarely active
 Astrobytes: Kepe55: what jacek said is correct
 Astrobytes: (for once :P )
 Kepe55: So if I solve a lot of easy puzzles, I will be able to solve medium ones?
 Astrobytes: That depends. You may have to do some off-site learning for unfamiliar concepts.
 Kepe55: alr, thx
 Astrobytes: You might need to become more familiar with or refresh your memory of graph theory, number theory, combinatorics
 Astrobytes: etc
 Kepe55: There should be hints for problems, that would help a lot when I'm stuck
 Astrobytes: there are for some easy official puzzles, otherwise there are forum threads for each puzzle where you can get hints or ask for advice
 Kepe55: Yeah I know, sometimes the forum can be helpful, but sometimes it's just people not understanding why some of the cases fail
 Kepe55: And not really a further explanation
 Astrobytes: Hence why you need to grasp the underlying nature of the problem first.
 Astrobytes: After you are comfortable with it, it's a matter of fixing bugs and/or optimising
 Kepe55: For the Folding a Note problem I just have a hard time coming up with code
 Kepe55: I understood the problem
 Kepe55: I can do easy cases on the whiteboard
 Astrobytes: Can you solve a case manually?
 Astrobytes: There you go
 Kepe55: Yes, easy cases
 Kepe55: but if I try to increase the letters to 4+ it gets confusing
 Astrobytes: Write down the steps, translate to code, handle edge cases
 Astrobytes: make an offline version too if you like
 Kepe55: Alr, thx
 Astrobytes: But keep trying
 Astrobytes: You're halfway there
 Mohammed_Galal: yeaaah I solved about 3-4 clashes 
 Astrobytes: Did you try puzzles Mohammed_Galal?
 Mohammed_Galal: Nope where is it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Mohammed_Galal:  Menu at the top, under Activities-&gt;Practice
 Astrobytes: Compete section has clashes, multiplayer bot programming, optimization and code golf. Practice has puzzles (no time limit) at various levels of difficulty.

 Mohammed_Galal: Thats amaaaaaazing man&#160;!
 Astrobytes: There is a *lot* more to the site than just clashes
 Mohammed_Galal: yeah I'm discovering now
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Mohammed_Galal: I'm learning from coursera but just getting bored from time to time and need something to play with to have more fun with coes
 Mohammed_Galal: codes*
 Astrobytes: As long as you have a basic level of proficiency you should be fine with puzzles or whatever, but be prepared to learn

 Mr.Programmer2938: hi
 Mohammed_Galal: finally I finished the descent
 Mohammed_Galal: btw guys I have a question
 Mohammed_Galal: seems no one here now&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: It was the invisible question.
 Mohammed_Galal: hahaha
 Mohammed_Galal: now I want to compare some variables with for
 Mohammed_Galal: So I took a value and compared to the next values in the array to find who is the biggest by adding the new biggest value to "Big" Variable and continue comparing it with the rest of the array values
 Mohammed_Galal: this is good right&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: You're comparing each array value with the big one&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Not sure, the way you said it...
 Mohammed_Galal: I have 8 numbers in a file switched them to an array with fscanf in PHP
 Mohammed_Galal: and starting comparing the values by taking the 0 value and start comparing to the 8 digits in the file 
 Mohammed_Galal: so now I have1
 Mohammed_Galal: 5
 Mohammed_Galal: 6
 Mohammed_Galal: 2
 Mohammed_Galal: so will compare by "for" 0 to 1 and add one in "Big" Variable then 1 to 5 then 5 to 6 then 6 to 1 
 Mohammed_Galal: now I have 6 in "Big" Variable right&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: In this case yes. But that's false
 Mohammed_Galal: okay let's assume it's yes
 Mohammed_Galal: Now I'm using "for" so the result will be 6
 BlaiseEbuth: Just add one more value, lets say 1. You end comparing 2 and 1, and put 2 in your "big" variable.
 Mohammed_Galal: when for finished and print 6 .. now I'm reset the compared value to 0 again so when I start a new compare the new result will be again 6
 Mohammed_Galal: yes I did this a new value for the top number
 Mohammed_Galal: but is supposed to give me 6 as a big number everytime I start the for loop right&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: If the values are the same, yes

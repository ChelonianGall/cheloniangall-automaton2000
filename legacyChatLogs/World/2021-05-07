 _Lupus_: by search they mean explore a tree that is more than one level deep. So think about the future rather than making a local decision
 Atatakakatta: ah, right
 _Lupus_: And because of the time limit, you have to "search" in that tree by pruning or prioritizing because otherwise you will never be done in time
 icecream17: "Mr. Tree uprooted himself&#160;:(" - wait...
 XeroOl: have you ever wanted to install some software, and that software is conveniently in the AUR
 orangesnowfox: "conveniently" what *isn't* in either the AUR or arch repo?
 XeroOl: lmao nevermind it failed to build I'm not going to praise this anymore
 XeroOl: okay too bad
 Smelty: alr, submitting with new if/else algo, hoping for best
 Smelty: icecream17 LMAO
 Smelty: shhh
 icecream17: _idea_
 Smelty: also WHAT WHEND U GET TO 60
 icecream17: =(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap i got my rewrite all wrong
 icecream17: wait wrong emoji
 Smelty: u demolished me by 20 points
 icecream17: typo
 Smelty: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u get input multiple times per day unless you wait
 icecream17: i meant to do a smiley fac
 Smelty: rip my noob bot
 icecream17: the improvement was very simple: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39f05797-e0f1-442c-a164-f91f71eb662c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39f05797-e0f1-442c-a164-f91f71eb662c</a>
 Majeck: TOP 100 WITH A TINY IF/ELSE BOT
 Majeck: I FEEL AMAZING
 Atatakakatta: I'm beginning to suspect most of the top 100 are &gt;_&gt;
 Atatakakatta: but yeah, it feels nice
 icecream17: inspired by struc who delays completing
 Zenoscave: struct isn't a heuristic bot. He doesn't have any logic he controls
 Zenoscave: ...
 Zenoscave: it's a full search bot
 icecream17: yeah but against smelt_ struc doesnt immediately complete. instead his bot generate 7 trees somehow. but i don't do that, so yeah
 Zenoscave: lol well gz
 BigFatDecker: hi
 actualCoderTrevor: I can't tell if my bot is getting worse or if it's moving down the ranks because other bots are getting better. It was about 110 6 hours ago now it's about 160
 Zenoscave: karliso yes
 Zenoscave: ah weird chat scroll sorry for ping
 Hjax: i think trying to search this game is going to make me sad
 icecream17: im going to copy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/517645b1b41879f41a03d852abdf2cddb4be73b8/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L272">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/517645b1b41879f41a03d852abdf2cddb4be73b8/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L272</a> for search
 Atatakakatta: most of the top contenders seem to be patient in some way
 Atatakakatta: whether it's programmed in like mine (now) or a search function says that's better
 icecream17: because i tried to do it myself but ended up with an immediate nested nested nested for loop
 Smelty: nooo im in 130 now&#160;:((
 Smelty: me noob
 XeroOl: you're ahead of me, at 165
 Smelty: sighs
 Smelty: wait how about we test our bots on each other and improve based on it
 XeroOl: meanwhile I'm learning a new language because lua isn't good enough
 XeroOl: my current bot is a wait bot
 geio: how can a read array in bash :slight_frown:
 XeroOl: you can test against my arena bot if you want
 geio: *i
 XeroOl: $arr[index]
 XeroOl: I'm fairly sure
 Smelty: rip 
 Smelty: ok
 Smelty: i mean like i can only test against ur arena bot
 XeroOl: oh you need curly braces
 Smelty: -
 Smelty: u beat me xD
 XeroOl: ${arr[index]}
 geio: &lt;3
 XeroOl: lmao
 XeroOl: I am lower ranked but I beat you
 XeroOl: link the game please lol
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547521386">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547521386</a>
 Smelty: my bot aint agressive enough
 Smelty: altho that was hte first time in 5 times i lost
 Smelty: just realized i was defining the wrong value bru
 Smelty: fixed <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547522525">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547522525</a>
 XeroOl: yeah that looks about right
 Smelty: that probably explains my huge rank drop..
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: well just resubmitted
 Smelty: 100% winrate so far..
 Atatakakatta: they always get your hopes up~
 Smelty: ikr, just lost one
 Smelty: i think it would be cool if it could be like more than 2 players
 Smelty: omg just won 169:14
 icecream17: :eyes:
 Atatakakatta: it's funny when someone submits and you see them battle you like 4 times in a row
 XeroOl: what is a bitboard and how do i make one?
 icecream17: a board represented by bits
 icecream17: for example
 jrke: each bit represents a part of game state
 XeroOl: so would that just be a 148 bit array in this case?
 Smelty: rip ranking fell even more
 XeroOl: where every 4 bits represents a tile's tree state?
 XeroOl: regardless of whether or not there's a tree there?
 Smelty: *le me realizing there are 36 tiles not 37*
 XeroOl: it's definitely 37
 Atatakakatta: ...there are 37 tiles
 LLG: yes
 LLG: from 1 to 37
 Atatakakatta: ooh, 121-121 tie
 Smelty: wait what
 LLG: or if you look at the board
 Atatakakatta: from 0 to 36
 Atatakakatta: actually
 Smelty: oops
 LLG: 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 + 7 + 15
 Smelty: thats what got me confused
 Smelty: xD
 LLG: indexed from 0 to 36 yeah, but I was referring to the image guide
 Smelty: the whole array starts at 0 thing
 XeroOl: the indexing system makes it a pain to do shadows with bitshifts on a bitboard
 Smelty: o.o
 XeroOl: we might just have to upgrade this to an 8x8
 Smelty: F
 fvla: 8x8 is great
 XeroOl: and come up with a separate indexing system
 fvla: 64-bit integer
 fvla: you can hashmap or something, idk
 XeroOl: ooh that's nice
 XeroOl: 64 bit integer for who owns each tile
 XeroOl: 64 bit integer for which tiles are occupied
 fvla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a1ffecb4-5f5e-4639-a79e-5c388aea3eda">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a1ffecb4-5f5e-4639-a79e-5c388aea3eda</a>
 XeroOl: 64 bit integer for which shadows are covered by a 1-high shadow
 XeroOl: yeah this is looking nice
 fvla: crap, i formatted it for chat, not monospace
 XeroOl: that's 9 wide
 Smelty: aaaugh rank 150 now
 fvla: i know, let me try again
 fvla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09401f9a-64ea-4c98-871e-fdf7ce4b45e5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09401f9a-64ea-4c98-871e-fdf7ce4b45e5</a>
 XeroOl: yeah that's what I was imagining
 XeroOl: then you can do bitshift magic
 fvla: axes of travel are n-s, e-w, nw-se
 Smelty: me a noob, me no understand bitshift
 icecream17: 121 to 120 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/547514339">https://www.codingame.com/replay/547514339</a>
 XeroOl: I still have the paste from earlier
 icecream17: close game #2
 fvla: m a s k s
 Atatakakatta: oh, just in case people missed it 
 Atatakakatta: Players gain an extra 1 point for every 3 sun points they have at the end of the game.
 XeroOl: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 Smelty: yay....rank 2939/2940
 XeroOl: for bitshift magic being fast
 LLG: what's your eval function like atm?
 icecream17: hmm, smelt_ said once about having 300 sun
 Smelty: if/else
 icecream17: which = 100
 Smelty: xDDD
 LLG: I'm still at work, will get to simming this afternoon
 Smelty: i didnt uproot any trees tho
 Smelty: so i still lost
 LLG: like, what things do you take into account when doing eval
 XeroOl: I'm concerned because I haven't done a basic search algorithm before
 XeroOl: and this one seems non-standard and non-trivial to debug
 Smelty: F
 LLG: I'd imagine points, suns and heuristic(tree)
 XeroOl: the bitboard sounds super complicated
 Atatakakatta: was at 52, making a small change
 Smelty: i feel like im going to just rewrite everything tommorow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think there is some game stages that need serious consideration
 XeroOl: should I go back to if/elsing?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like endgame...no point seeding
 Atatakakatta: mhm, that's why I posted that!
 Smelty: send help my ranking is at 200 no
 Smelty: 220
 Atatakakatta: wasting sun points decreases your final score
 Smelty: i stop planting at 18
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i chose day 20
 PatrickMcGinnisII: of course i'm rank 500, have no shadow adjustments, etc.
 Smelty: THATS IT IM RESETTING
 jrke: yesterday something happened to my visual studio code and it got uninstalled but now i fixed it back to work!!
 XeroOl: I'm at 172 with no shadow adjustments @patrick
 Smelty: i was at 100 with no shadow
 Smelty: but now im at 360
 Smelty: and just reset code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm just paying for the most expensive stuff i can afford
 XeroOl: that's a bit too simple
 XeroOl: maybe try to favor planting in the middle
 Smelty: yes..
 XeroOl: maybe try keeping a big tree alive for longer to save up more sun points
 XeroOl: maybe keep track of the sun points you have to make sure you can complete everything on the last turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, but my structure is setup
 XeroOl: some ideas for improvement
 jrke: valid actions are varying from 10 to 100+
 Smelty: i just resetted code, and now idk what to do
 Smelty:&#160;:((
 Atatakakatta: start from the beginning
 Smelty: yes but idk what is beginning xD
 Atatakakatta: harvesting trees
 Smelty: hm yes
 IrisOnTheWay: rerun again.
 Atatakakatta: I was briefly #23
 Atatakakatta: then big losing streak &gt;&lt;
 Smelty: oof
 Atatakakatta: my code is still so simple lol
 Atatakakatta: still haven't taught the trees how to throw seeds
 Atatakakatta: further than 1 space
 Smelty: what
 Smelty: then howd u get to 23-
 icecream17: just keep going until you hit -1
 Smelty: hh-
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i do kill trees too early
 icecream17: the power of if-else and coding at 11pm
 icecream17: super late
 Atatakakatta: because it's not that important I guess, I dunno
 icecream17: i dont actually do anything with the shadow information
 Atatakakatta: I don't think even struct does
 Smelty: xD
 icecream17: i still calculate it though
 Smelty: im stuck, dangit
 Atatakakatta: ooh I'm right below someone I've actually heard of
 Atatakakatta: or at least I was
 icecream17: i just figured the best way to format long if statements
 Smelty: o.o
 Atatakakatta: how did I fall from 23 to 40 without doing anything&#160;;(
 Smelty: f
 PatrickMcGinnisII: early game, maximize sun ramp...mid game, more strategy, endgame, eat trees...wierd
 Smelty: hm
 Smelty: imma sleep, its late for me
 Atatakakatta: honestly
 Atatakakatta: don't overcomplicate it
 Atatakakatta: my strategy is extremely simple and I'm top 40
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/808e13b9-8769-4e50-8db1-c78eb6ed668f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/808e13b9-8769-4e50-8db1-c78eb6ed668f</a>
 Atatakakatta: basically that yeah
 Atatakakatta: I have 1 single If statement that decides whether to complete
 icecream17: i was talking about formatting long if statments
 Atatakakatta: ~~that's actually what my code looks like though~~
 icecream17: what!? as a js person, this is very unintuitive
 icecream17: amazing
 icecream17: i wish to learn another language other than js and python (and typescript)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: acorns are like blockers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so wierd
 Atatakakatta: soooo many bots are wasting all their sun points in the last couple turns
 phord: Woof!  I did something right, just mucking with simple if/switch and not considering scores.  Jumped from 2500 -&gt; 624.
 phord: -&gt; 500's
 PatrickMcGinnisII: minor change, 100 ranks better, so wierd
 Atatakakatta: there's a lot of submissions really close together
 Atatakakatta: a small change can make a big difference
 Atatakakatta: most high-level games end up really close
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, ended up 150 rank better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i basically sim one day, spending as much as possible...i don't do any benefit analysis
 phord: So. Codingame tries to sign me up for a job search, but the max gross salary is $200k.  Do they only find jobs outside the Bay Area?
 Atatakakatta: lol oof
 Atatakakatta: I just moved out of there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sleeptime, glhf
 phord: :night:
 phord: I might as well not be here for the past year with wfh. But still, that range was peanuts.  Oh, but minimum could go as low as $20k.
 Marchete: 200k is peanuts?
 Marchete: I'll take the peanuts plz
 pmor: it is in the bay area unless you live in your parents basement
 phord: It's median tech income in the bay area.  
 icecream17: gn
 phord: Basically only "entry level" positions at FAANG for that much.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Amazon,Apple,Google,Facebook&amp;track=Software%20Engineer">https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Amazon,Apple,Google,Facebook&amp;track=Software%20Engineer</a>

 YKY: I'm participating Spring Challenge 2021. But video doesn't play so that I can't see real time progress. How do I do??
 phord: Restart your browser.  Switch browsers (firefox).  I hear they're working on it.  Known problem.
 Notter: Hey guys, I just got randomly promoted to bronze league in a bot programming game again.
 phord: Randomly?  Your bot keeps going after you're promoted to Wood league. Probably you just leveled up twice.  Congrats.
 Marchete: or someone else beat the boss
 Marchete: and you go over the boss
 Marchete: you just need to be above the boss at any time (after your submit is 100% calculated)
 Notter: phord That does not make sense because I only programmed my bot to wait each turn.
 actualCoderTrevor: that's the pro strat
 Marchete: Spring Challenge?
 Marchete: just pick possible moves and give some ordering
 Marchete: I mean, most bronze is that
 phord: Notter that's pretty weird.  Check your last battles. Did you win any?
 Atatakakatta: I mean, almost 90% of people are in bronze league &gt;_&gt;
 Atatakakatta: just not timing out might be enough?

 ZarthaxX: if else spaghetti?
 Notter: phord No, I only won against people with -1 score
 Zenoscave: Not spaghetti. organized
 Zenoscave: But yeah complete if-else. Tried a search need to optim before it's ready
 ZarthaxX: i see :P
 Marchete: sun calculation seems the hardest part
 Zenoscave: for shadows?
 Marchete: yeah
 Zenoscave: it's the slowest for sure
 Marchete: but overall rules seem logical
 Marchete: not like other games
 aCat: meh
 aCat: because they copied finished product
 phord: Didn't know you could get  -1.  
 aangairbender: true
 Marchete: neighbours with -1, yes
 Marchete: a bit confusing and crashes a lot of bots
 Marchete: aCat oware abapa is copied too
 Marchete: and imo rules are sh*t
 actualCoderTrevor: score of -1 means your code is broken
 aCat: because it is not a modern boardgame
 dbdr: I even heard chess might be copied
 Marchete: heresy!
 aCat: and chess are enough balanced and complex
 Illedan: Mornin
 aCat: hi
 mzbear: i went from wood to bronze with a WAIT-only AI, so, yes, it's quite easy...
 ZarthaxX: hi illo:*
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 phord: I definitely did not advance to bronze with WAIT-only.  I think I did advance to Wood, though.
 actualCoderTrevor: "6 neigh variables, one for each direction, containing the index of a neighboring cell or -1 is there is no neighbor." When is there no neighbor?
 Thienu: at the edge of the board
 phord: actualCoderTrevor On the edge of the easrth.
 aangairbender: sides of the map?
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh Oh Oh
 actualCoderTrevor: smh I'm dumb&#160;:)
 aangairbender: why do we need that info at all?
 aangairbender: I mean isnt the map always the same?
 Thienu: I used it to precompute where trees can seed
 actualCoderTrevor: You can use it to calculate the distance from a space (at least that's what I'm trying to do). Yes but I think getting it from the problem is maybe more convenient.
 actualCoderTrevor: And you can use it for shadows
 Maliamnon: shadows as linked lists of neighbors&#160;:)
 Marchete: or encoded in uint64
 Marchete: 1 &lt;&lt; cellid
 ANONYMOUS42: is it a good idea to make a look up table for all the neighbors for all the cells
 Marchete: lookup shadows for each sun direction
 aangairbender: it might be helpful as an optimization
 Marchete: and tree size
 aCat: ok, so what is actually faster?
 aCat: arr[index] or num &gt;&gt; index*2 &amp; 0b11 
 aangairbender: I would say second
 XeroOl: it depends on how much is in the cache
 aangairbender: cause no RAM access
 aangairbender: but it really depends on context
 XeroOl: cpu performance is a pain to understand
 aCat: Illedan I;m in c# so the bit is faster than array&#160;?
 Marchete: what array size?
 XeroOl: the first one can be faster, and the second one could be faster
 aCat: 37 ^^
 ANONYMOUS42: would cache really be an issue here if there is only 37
 XeroOl: well, it depends
 MoMaT: it probably doesn't matter which is faster aCat, but rather if it fits in cache or not.
 Marchete: what I know it's faster is to avoid loop traverse
 MoMaT: so your data alignment matter the most.
 aCat: Hi MoMaT welcome back&#160;;-)
 Marchete: like for shadows and stuff
 XeroOl: if you only have one globally, 37 isn't a cache issue
 ANONYMOUS42: yeah it depends on how big each cell is in memory
 aangairbender: premature optimizations seem fun
 XeroOl: if you're building a tree of gamestates
 Illedan: AHH, caching of shadows :O But my calc is fast enough
 XeroOl: it's going to matter what the size is
 MoMaT: it's not 37&#160;:) especially not in C#...
 Marchete: shadows encoded as uint64 bitmask
 Marchete: so you just calculate 1 by height
 XeroOl: if it's 37 * number of turns, then you can probably just store them as bytes
 Marchete: then apply to all these trees
 Illedan: does it take into account the heights of the target cell?
 Marchete: like  is  bitmask &amp; (1&lt;&lt;cellid)&#160;!= 0
 XeroOl: yeah shadow is 2 bits per tile
 Marchete: by height
 Marchete: first 3
 Marchete: then 3+2
 Marchete: etc
 aCat: but this is just shadow Marchete not its strength
 ZarthaxX: shadows hardcoded&#160;??
 Marchete: bitmask are useful there
 Marchete: strenght?
 Marchete: strength*
 ZarthaxX: size matters
 XeroOl: you need 2 bits of shadow info per tile
 ZarthaxX: for the shadow
 Marchete: 2 bits?
 ANONYMOUS42: could there be a systematic way of arranging the cells so that you can figure out the indices of the 6 neighbors directly?
 aCat: aaa ok, I get your idea
 XeroOl: for height of the object casting the shadow
 ZarthaxX: shadow is dependant of height
 Marchete: you start with 3
 ZarthaxX: you want to encode in a bitmask the actual shadow&#160;?
 Marchete: do shadow 3
 Marchete: -&gt; bitmask
 ZarthaxX: im confused
 Marchete: applied to tree 3
 XeroOl: @anonymous42 yes
 Marchete: then go to 2, calc shadow2
 XeroOl: someone made this diagram <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09401f9a-64ea-4c98-871e-fdf7ce4b45e5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09401f9a-64ea-4c98-871e-fdf7ce4b45e5</a>
 Marchete: shadow3 | shadow2
 Marchete: apply to tree 2
 Marchete: etc etc
 XeroOl: it's better to pack it 2 bits each
 XeroOl: than to do 2 shifts to read one value
 Zenoscave: Well that helps my bitboards a lot
 aCat: the more I think about it the more I like Marchete idea more
 aCat: you don't have any comparisons of heights
 rmuskovets: wood league is so easy...
 Zenoscave: that's why it's the first league&#160;;)
 aCat: for tree of size k you just kall bitmak for sizes k and higher
 aCat: :kiss_cat:
 XeroOl: yeah I like that
 XeroOl: are y'all using the game's tile coordinate system?
 XeroOl: or an easier shape to bitmask
 Marchete: 1ULL &lt;&lt; cellID
 Zenoscave: index in a flat bit line
 Zenoscave: ^^^^ that
 Marchete: you can precalc all
 aCat: you dont need coordinates system as there is no real movement
 Marchete: no coord at all
 XeroOl: it's not fun to precalc the shaows
 Marchete: just some precalc
 ANONYMOUS42: i still don't get how you get the neighbors' indices from that diagram 
 Zenoscave: All that BFS for nothing T.T
 aCat: yep Zeno
 XeroOl: the game feeds you the neighbor indices
 XeroOl: it's one of the inputs
 ANONYMOUS42: i was more curious if you can figure them out analytially, like some magic formula to get them lol 
 ANONYMOUS42: not necessarily how i'd implement them
 XeroOl: not really, because it's a spiral
 XeroOl: which is a pain
 ANONYMOUS42: yeah which is why i though it's a cool problem
 ANONYMOUS42: i wonder if it's even possible
 XeroOl: well, theoretically
 XeroOl: I don't know if it's possible to get the runtime to be linear on it
 ANONYMOUS42: yeah proving that would require some graph theory magic 
 ANONYMOUS42: or something else who knows
 phord: It would be more practical on a larger spiral. But only three layers is kinda meh.
 rmuskovets: looks like bronze won't be hard too... i just wrote a rly simple heuristic that chooses actions from the list
 rmuskovets: or it might be, actually
 phord: Ar255 crushing it.  Saving his tree harvest until the last days, the sweeping the floor with my ass.
 Marchete: top10 has many python players, so heuristics are good in this game
 Illedan: Meh, this is as search heavy as you can make it
 phord: I got into bronze by basically choosing actions at random.
 Marchete: but in this case heuristics can have a chance
 rmuskovets: this game looks so much easier than previous challenges
 Zenoscave: easier to start probably going to be a tough gold/legend
 rmuskovets: 'simple to learn, hard to master'
 rmuskovets: for me its a huge plus we get the action list every turn
 rmuskovets: no need to calculate it myself
 Zenoscave: 'back in my day...'
 rmuskovets: yeah
 Marchete: and turns are not just player 0 then 1
 Zenoscave: Oh god the horror of turn orders
 Marchete: it's simultaneous and in some cases a player can have more moves
 Marchete: that complicates some searches
 rmuskovets: well... im prob gonna just tune my heuristic until it
 rmuskovets: 's perfect-ish
 eulerscheZahl: you won't get too far that way
 rmuskovets: im already better than where i was last challenge
 eulerscheZahl: in the end simulation almost always wins
 Zenoscave: top silver maybe gold if your heuristic is decent
 LordSkaven: I havent used or looked at the possible moves at all yet
 kovi: yeah, search heavy&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: it's not even 24h into the contest, current ranking is meaningless
 rmuskovets: true
 phord: Shut up!  I broke 200 and I'm proud of it!
 Zenoscave: Yeah. I'm beating euler even
 eulerscheZahl: everyone is beating me
 LordSkaven: doesnt most game AI just come down to simulation tho?
 Zenoscave: sssshhhhh&#160;;)
 kovi: and once again limited interaction
 BlueArtemis: guess at least we're having fun with it
 Marchete: I beat you a NS, that was more important to me :D
 Marchete: at*
 BlueArtemis: even my dumb AI beats people xd
 rmuskovets: eulerscheZahl: looks like even i do
 Zenoscave: for now.
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't beat me at NS Marchete, you beat NS itself
 LordSkaven: eulerscheZahl you should go to the police if everyone is beating you, sounds painful and like assault
 rmuskovets: lmao
 actualCoderTrevor: OMG I just realized I can battle my IDE bot vs my arena bot. Now I won't have to wait an hour to figure out if my tiny tweaks were an improvement or not.&#160;:)
 rmuskovets: or you can battle the people in top 10
 rmuskovets: you'll know then for sure
 actualCoderTrevor: I already know that outcome :P
 actualCoderTrevor: Damn I lost to me
 Zenoscave: I broke something
 rmuskovets: maybe
 rmuskovets: maybe you did
 Notter: Hey guys, apparently the default AI can beat itself.
 rmuskovets: huh. cool
 icecream17: the game seems symettrical, but sunlight only goes in  by one direction, so it's not
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh the board is symmetrical but the shadows aren't so there is some luck involved
 actualCoderTrevor: right lol
 rmuskovets: lol im place 666
 icecream17: struc gets 204 pts! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547576289">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547576289</a>
 icecream17: *207
 Zenoscave: 207 you forgot sun bonus
 icecream17: 3000 players inbronze
 jrke: exact 3000 coders in bronze
 rmuskovets: noice
 LordSkaven: struct is op pls nerf
 rmuskovets: yes
 Zenoscave: struct is just quick to the game. Other's will beat him soon
 rmuskovets: <s>everyone above me is op</s>
 icecream17: me too
 jrke: people will get him soon cause its the 1st day of contest so wait until everybody codes the algo
 phord: I thought you went to bed, icecream17. lol
 icecream17: oh yeah
 phord: I gotta go put in gf time.  My bot is going to crack 100 while I'm away, I think.
 icecream17: gn
 rmuskovets: my bot got 107 points in one run, thats gud
 rmuskovets: lets see how it competes in arena
 Tiramon: some nice bot improvements over night ... droped from 2 to 17 
 phord: How I do vs. my own IDE code?  I forgot again.
 rmuskovets: you delete the opponent below your code
 Tiramon: there is a delete button below the players and you can choose a new one phord
 phord: :ok_hand_tone4:
 rmuskovets: lmao i removed one '+1' from my heuristic and now im top 300
 rmuskovets: i was top 600 before
 khalillamharchi20: hello
 rmuskovets: hi
 resty-daze: wow, just don't cut trees until end game entering the top 100
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: top 100 gang
 rmuskovets: top 300 gang is bette
 rmuskovets: im in there
 rmuskovets: and it has 3 times more people
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok top 30 gang now and my code is digusting
 Zenoscave: new submit NotSureWhyThisWorks
 Zenoscave:&#160;???
 LouisLOurson: is there a way to force a battle against a specific oppenent?
 Zenoscave: only in testing LouisLOurson
 eulerscheZahl: delete default AI
 rmuskovets: delete your current opponent and choose the one you want
 phord: That's how you know you're almost finished. NotSureWhyThisWorks
 Sakisan: can't be top300 without including the top100 though
 eulerscheZahl: you can only seelct top1000 as opponent
 ddreams: you can also search
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I wonder what the next set of rules will be
 Zenoscave: none bronze is final rules
 resty-daze: no new rules imo
 jrke: yup no new rules just increase in difficulty level
 rmuskovets: is good
 eulerscheZahl: in rare cases there are balancing updates for silver. but I don't think it will happen here
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: how will difficulty increase without extra rules?
 jrke: ya the game look balanced
 Zenoscave: opponents are also writing better bots
 Sakisan: we are the difficulty&#160;:)
 rmuskovets: imagine if they delete the possible actions list
 eulerscheZahl: just stronger players
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh true lol
 jrke: ask MS about balancing
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: legend league full of if/else
 ddreams: wouldn't make a difference if they deleted the possible action list at higher levels
 rmuskovets: well i use it to simplify my code
 StyllyMyle: can someone expain me league system?
 ddreams: if you want to search, you need to be able to generate the possible actions yourself
 resty-daze: get a higher elo than boss to next level
 ddreams: wood leagues: tutorials
 jrke: rmuskovets in higher leagues difficulty increases or new set of rules are intruced or even both
 ddreams: bronze and higher: real opponents
 rmuskovets: i wonder how many people use the starter kit
 Zenoscave: at least 4
 MoMaT: @StyllyMyle, in this contest, the early leagues are not really important. you go through wood to learn the rules.
 phord: 57
 MoMaT: then you start playing for real.
 MoMaT: to move from bornze to silver you need better score than the boss.
 jrke: last time 3000+ bronzies became on silver opening day and this time under 24 hours of launch of contest
 rmuskovets: i went to bronze in under 3 hours this time
 MaslowP: can i check how to resolve the warning where my code is not reading all available input? 
 ddreams: do you output more than one action?
 ddreams: do you output an endline?
 MoMaT: then you can fight further to get to gold, and legend.
 jrke: tally your code with given input protocol
 ddreams: are you certain you read all the input before you output?
 MoMaT: @Jrke, unfortunately that's what happens when you use very weak bosses in wood.
 Zenoscave: I'm off to bed. didn't realize how late it was gn
 MoMaT: in contests with well constructed leagues it took some effort to get to bronze. not one line of logic.
 Tiramon: MaslowP you must have missed something ... if you send me your code i will have a look at it, else it is guessingprobably more than one output per loop or really not reading everything
 resty-daze: just don't break or return when reading inputs
 Tiramon: nice bot Zenoscave you did it =)
 Zenoscave: thx Tiramon
 jrke: what he did?
 Zenoscave: beat tiramon
 MaslowP: okay ur right for the more than one output, thanks, i found it
 Tiramon: top 10
 Tiramon: and beat me ...yes
 Zenoscave: lol I just hope it doesn't degrade too much by silver
 jrke: and making you out of top 10
 jrke: zeno is that algo bot or simple heuristic
 Tiramon: i hate it when ide looses against arena bot ...
 Zenoscave: ply 0
 resty-daze: when will we have silver?
 ddreams: you just sort the actions?
 Zenoscave: No search but there is a scoring mechanism
 Zenoscave: yeah
 Zenoscave: monday resty-daze
 resty-daze: thx cool
 Tiramon: resty-daze monday ... click on the league in the ide and it shows you the dates of league openings
 rmuskovets: rank 333... nice time for a new submit
 rmuskovets: looks like this heuristic change is for good
 rmuskovets: why does it move me to rank 3k+ when i submit&gt;
 rmuskovets:&#160;?*
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: will gold and legend leagues open a few days after each other like silver?
 jrke: yes
 jrke: silver then gold then legend
 Tiramon: i think it was monday, wednesday, friday
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok thx
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 geppoz: hi, bronze rules are the final ones?
 Illedan: Bugs all over
 ddreams: In your code or the contest?
 Illedan: My code
 ddreams: Yes, bronze rules are final
 geppoz: ty
 ddreams: Should be some way to pin answers here
 geppoz: :D sorry
 ddreams: Np, not your fault
 itzluku: how can i do the following in python:list of tupels (x,y)&#160;; sort list by 1st by getvalueofindex(x) and 2nd by getvalueofindex(y)
 ddreams: probably a great answer to that on stack overflow
 itzluku: meaning x and y have to be piped into a function first to get the value that i want to compare
 ddreams: put basically that question into google
 itzluku: bro
 itzluku: im searching since hours
 itzluku: i gave up
 ddreams: ok, let me try
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25046306/sort-a-2d-list-first-by-1st-column-and-then-by-2nd-column">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25046306/sort-a-2d-list-first-by-1st-column-and-then-by-2nd-column</a>
 ddreams: sorted(l,key=lambda x: (x[0],x[1]))) 
 ddreams: except instead of x[0] x[1] you use your function
 schachmatt: does the referee in the github link work with brutaltester?
 ddreams: that's the top link for "python sort 1st and 2nd"
 itzluku: basicly i have x
 itzluku: and i need to check (f1(x),f2(x))
 itzluku: i guess
 ddreams: Python is pretty cool
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: can't you just generate the tuples first and then sort?
 ddreams: That's probably a good idea if your function is heavy, because it'll probably be called several times for the same x
 ddreams: or you could memoize it
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: is anyone actually using the shade?
 ddreams: since struct is searching 20 levels deep, certainly
 itzluku: trying
 ddreams: if not you're gonna get the wrong sun value
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yeah thats true
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I thought most people would be using heuristics at this stage
 ddreams: generally you want that for searches too
 itzluku: dude
 itzluku: im so lost
 itzluku: ill post what i got
 itzluku: given a list of strings with numbers
 itzluku: iGrow
 itzluku: iGrow_t=map(lambda x:(x,x), self.iGrow)
 itzluku: iGrow_t_sorted = sorted(iGrow_t, key = lambda x&#160;: (self.hexagon[int(x)].size,self.hexagon[int(x)].richness), reverse=True)
 itzluku: and now i have the problem, i lost the index in that new tupel
 itzluku: -.-
 itzluku: prettymuch given a list of indices as strings ( possible cells to grow a tree) -&gt; sort that by treesize then richness both in desync order
 itzluku: prettymuch coding since 16h straight yikes
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: just make the tuples (size, richness, index) and then sort. Not the best method but simple
 ddreams: simple is good
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: 16h is about 10 hours too long
 ddreams: and in this case probably faster too
 itzluku: yeh i know its not productive
 itzluku: but fuck it its a jam
 itzluku: iGrow_t=map(lambda x:(x,x,x), self.iGrow)
 itzluku: iGrow_t_sorted = sorted(iGrow_t, key = lambda x&#160;: (self.hexagon[int(x)].size,self.hexagon[int(x)].richness,x), reverse=True)
 Zanoshky: What is this game about?
 Zanoshky: BFS?
 itzluku: self.iGrow=map(lambda x: x[2], iGrow_t_sorted)
 itzluku: like that?
 itzluku: @Zanoshky na
 ddreams: don't use functions in your sort
 itzluku: there is a 8min vid on yt
 Zanoshky: @itzluku which algorithm is this about?
 itzluku: given a list of indices as strings ( possible cells to grow a tree) -&gt; sort that by treesize then richness both in desync order
 itzluku: but i just cant get these 1 line sort functions to work
 ddreams: make the tuple with those values first
 ddreams: then sort simply
 ddreams: now your tuple is three times the same value, for no reason
 itzluku: iGrow_t=map(lambda x:(self.hexagon[int(x)].size,self.hexagon[int(x)].richness,x), self.iGrow)
 itzluku: like that?
 ddreams: print it and see?
 itzluku: well
 itzluku: map objects
 itzluku: aha
 itzluku: wtf
 itzluku: haha
 TobiasA: can actions only be performed on trees once a day
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 itzluku: depends on your div
 TobiasA: i'm in wood 1
 Developer.py: How can I change the possible actions?
 itzluku: in bronze u can make as many moves as possible turn based, if both players WAIT then the next day begins
 ddreams: you can still only output one action per round
 itzluku: hm
 itzluku: i think ill just do 69 for loops now
 Developer.py: Can I not give my own output? Do i have to print the output that is given to me as `possible_actions`
 Tiramon: you can create your own output as long as syntax is right
 itzluku: u parse the output in a given format, so the game works&#160;;)
 Developer.py: oh okay
 Developer.py: thanks a lot
 JormaW: Can someone help me with the Enigma Machine decoding? I got the encoding right but not sure about the decoding part
 Marchete: in fact you should check possible actions given by the game with your calculated possible actions, to validate that your simulation is right
 jrke: can a tree casted in shadow can cast shadow?
 Thienu: yes
 Tiramon: sure
 Vischtor: Has someone else experianced rendering issues with the graphics window in the spring challenge? For me, there's only a greyish window with no graphics in it&#160;:( (Other games/challenges work fine)
 Tiramon: Vischtor are you using chrome?
 Vischtor: yes
 Vischtor: latest version on windows
 Tiramon: tryy another browser
 Tiramon: there seems to be an outdated animation lib 
 Tiramon: should be updated soon, but currently it is a bit bugged
 Tiramon: ff worked fine for most
 Marchete: graphics are very cute, I like it
 Vischtor: Ok, will try&#160;:) Is there a ff plugin as well (I like the chrome plugin)
 Marchete: I use chrome, version 90.0.4430.93 
 Marchete: maybe disabling GPU acceleration or smth
 Tiramon: for cg local? yes there is a ff plugin for that =)
 Vischtor: Apparently i had hardware acceleration disabled, enabled it and things seem to work fine! 
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 Vischtor: Thank you @Marchete for the tip&#160;:) 
 Tiramon: it is possible to disable hardware acceleration ... ok ...
 Marchete: yeah, on some computers chrome crashes hard when hardware acc is on
 Marchete: blue screen
 Marchete: based on a true history
 Hoyer: there are so many possible actions per turn damn
 Tiramon: yes ... else it would be far to easy to make the 'perfect' bot
 Hoyer: someone will still manage to get close :smile:
 BoBot: hey, if I try to join Coding Escape, I get a messageYou are currently #492, want to get early access?
 BoBot: does that mean I am that far down the line of applicants? also there is no mention that I can see of what I need to do to get the early access
 mybk: checkout your email 
 Marchete: I have some doubt
 Marchete: sun-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;1
 Marchete: hmm nvm :D
 LLG: still have no idea how to go about implementing eval function yet
 ddreams: return game.score;
 ddreams: add on from there :p
 LLG: that's exactly where I'm at lol
 Marchete: sum(w * bunch_of_data_from_board)
 Marchete: try a lot of w coeff
 Marchete: until you win
 BoBot: @mybk hey, do you know if they will send the e-mail immediately?
 Fluxor: I do not see anything anymore  when I log on stderr. Does anyone has this issue? Was stderr disabled?
 ddreams: writing endline?
 Fluxor: yes
 ddreams: stderr works as always
 Fluxor: strange, it was working yesterday indeed
 Marchete: flush?
 Fluxor: I will try and restart the browser...
 ddreams: stderr generally flushes on endline
 Fluxor:         cerr &lt;&lt; "TEST" &lt;&lt; endl;
 ddreams: probably something else in your code
 Fluxor: even with a dummy test program like that...
 Fluxor: I mean I reproduce with these 2 lines
 Machinist: Hi
 Code_Guy123: heyo
 Machinist: I am new to programming
 Code_Guy123: dw, u will catch the pace
 ddreams: Fluxor, I reset to the default code and did it, worked well
 Machinist: Thank You.
 ddreams: Standard Error Stream:TESTStandard Output Stream:WAIT
 Fluxor: ok I will try that
 Illedan: Hm, games are so fast I get blocked from running&#160;:(
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: If I update code in the IDE and play the code without testing in the arena, will it affect the version in the arena?
 ddreams: no
 VizGhar: no
 Tiramon: arena will always be effected when submited
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok thx
 LLG: oh btw is it just me or is the Bronze boss really weak?
 Marchete: yes
 LLG: I'm still on my Wood code and it beats the bronze boss no problem
 Tiramon: there is no bronze boss ...
 Tiramon: and yes default is pretty weak
 VizGhar: because that boss isnt cutting trees
 Marchete: well, wood boss
 LLG: oh wait yeah Default is not actually a boss lmao
 Tiramon: oh yes wood bosses are also pretty week
 LLG: somehow I thought it was
 Tiramon: *weak
 VizGhar: bronze boss will be introduced in moday (not sure about specific time) based on some player's implementation right?
 Marchete: yes, probably at 50% bronze or smth like that
 VizGhar: 50% seems too much, id go for 30% at max
 VizGhar: we will see
 Hasuzawa: If I can reach silver I am satisfied, never reached even 1 silver in bot programming
 VizGhar: gl Hasuzawa
 LLG: I spent the last couple hours getting the bitboards to (supposedly) work 😩
 Hasuzawa: thx
 LLG: I don't usually work with bitwise ops so it was a challenge
 VizGhar: isn't it too early for bitboards LLG?
 VizGhar: you already got some nice eval?
 LLG: I just wanted to get it done first so I don't have to worry about it later on
 LLG: last contest my BFS was slowed down because my bot took a very long time trying to generate game states
 Marchete: what kind of bitboard
 LLG: wdym what kind
 Marchete: full board representation?
 LLG: I have uhhh
 VizGhar: what you are trying to represent with that bitboard
 LLG: one for the soils
 LLG: one for the trees
 kuhnchris: I just noticed that my code is so bonkers that I just used random moves due to an comparision error
 kuhnchris: still reached Silver :notLikeThis:
 ddreams: silver opens on monday though, was a bug that made people silver
 VizGhar: ++
 kuhnchris: So we need to re-evaluate for silver then, or is it just carrying us over as soon as ilver opens?
 LLG: I ended low gold last contest
 LLG: if I have enough time to spend on this I'd probably shoot for high gold
 ddreams: as long as your code beats the boss, you don't need to do anything
 Marchete: just stay above the boss
 kuhnchris: :thumbsup:,
 Tiramon: atleast my bot stays in the top 20&#160;:)
 Hoyer: if i complete a tree is the ground underneath it still dormant until next day?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I don't think a cell can be dormant
 Tiramon: only a tree
 kuhnchris: Only the tree can be dormant
 Tiramon: you can complete and directly reseed a cell
 Hoyer: okay nice, that's what I wanted to know
 Tiramon: if your opponent isn't trying to seed the same cell&#160;;)
 RezaSi: when will bronze boss be released?
 Nerchio: monday
 Tiramon: monday, wednesday, friday are the release dates
 RezaSi: ok tnx
 Q12: How do you calc the index on the grid of the neighbors of a given index on the grid?  Do you built a dictionary for this?
 Cukinoden: what does it mean dormant in the game please&#160;?
 Cukinoden: what the utility of it in bronze league
 LLG: if a tree is dormant, you can't perform any action on it until the next turn
 wlesavo: Q12 you can just make an array 36x6
 Prss: hi, any help in spring chellenge why i dont see game&#160;? do i don't have plugins or smth&#160;?
 KiwiTae: Prss use another browser 
 Mark_Davis: uwu
 Q12: Okay, I thought maybe there is a way of calculating the index, Thanks wlesavo
 LLG: Cukinoden for example you can't GROW a dormant tree, you can't COMPLETE a dormant tree, you can't SEED from a dormant tree
 Q12: " A dormant tree cannot be the subject of an action."
 Cukinoden: ahh okey that's interesting 
 Cukinoden: because i wasn't take it in consideration in the past 2 leagues 
 Tiramon: Zenoscave stop beating me&#160;;)
 KiwiTae: struct bot gonna be gold boss? hehe
 AntiSquid: bronze boss
 LordSkaven: I see a lot of people are doing the strat of only completing at the end of the game, interesting approach
 struct: im still first?
 mybk: ofcource 
 Asterixk: for now...
 struct: yeah
 struct: it wont last much longer
 AntiSquid: nothing prevents you to improve
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: struct what kind of alg did you use? If you don't mind me asking lol
 Illedan: He said Bogosort
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Bogosort is too OP
 struct: beam search, the only reason im first is because I tested the game
 AntiSquid: that doesn't make any sense
 AntiSquid: (bogosort)
 ddreams: how long were your headstart though?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yeah fair enough. Just wondering how many people are using some kind of search alg
 LLG: I know your depth is 20 struct
 LLG: how about beam width?
 struct: I started like 2 weeks ago, but I did not started instantly
 struct: So I would say this bot is like 6 days or something
 LLG: also the 4 numbers your bot says, what do they represent (if you don't mind me asking ofc)
 struct: bot represents tree height for each height
 struct: Also I wont reveal everything sorry :p
 struct: beam width is a bit large though
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I wonder if the if/else bots will last until the end of the contest
 Hoyer: Hm why can you compete if you had a 2 week headstart?
 Hoyer: Isn't that a bit unfair? Sorry for asking
 LLG: if (winning) keepGoing else tryHarder
 AntiSquid: depends what you mean by if else
 AntiSquid: you can have a sim and good if/else and beat everyone
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: just algorithms that don't involve simulation or NN or anything
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: just heuristics
 AntiSquid: does checking shadows count as sim?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I wouldn't count it as sim by itself
 Tiramon: only if you check the shadows for the next turns&#160;;)
 LLG: ^ this
 LLG: otherwise it's just using existing information, not simulating anything
 AntiSquid: ok then your definition of if else can reach #1 at the end of contest
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: nice
 AntiSquid: but that's why you check shadows Tiramon to see if you mess things up next turn lol
 AntiSquid: man the goal post keeps moving @_@
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I'm not submitting my better bots because its too early for this level of competition
 AntiSquid: oh my
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I only have a few tricks left up my sleeve to implement
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lmao
 Tiramon: i only check shadows to see the amount of days a specifc cell is in shadows
 struct: I dont do that at all
 AntiSquid: so fix it
 RezaSi: Is coding escape good? who tested it here?
 AntiSquid: funny, ValGrowth wrecked the gocoder one contest and those guys wonder what hit them 
 eulerscheZahl: saw that too, congrats to ValGrowth
 eulerscheZahl: but watching the replays is boring
 struct: euler i made it past the 12 hours :D
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 Marchete: link?
 eulerscheZahl: at kutulu my nerfed version of my bot (wait every 10 turns, low depth) was silver boss. try to beat that
 struct:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1014023664">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1014023664</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i still don'T understand the mode how they determine the winner :D
 eulerscheZahl: and chat is back to laggy, was fine at 5:30am
 Developer.py: my output stream keeps giving me this warning " Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur." even though my code is at the very end
 LordSkaven: I beat euler, my life is complete
 ddreams: you output more than one action probably
 ddreams: or miss a newline
 dbf: Developer.py do you use 1 command per turn?
 Marchete: I beat it too
 Marchete: and I remember everytime I can :D
 Marchete: him*
 eulerscheZahl: "it", how nice
 LordSkaven: you are a toad after all
 eulerscheZahl: i just submitted my first dumb monte carlo
 Marchete: full simulator?
 Developer.py: thanks @ddreams
 Marchete: you guys are fast&#160;:)
 Tuan2.le: how many action can i act in a turn?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, pretty much complete sim
 ddreams: one per turn
 eulerscheZahl: will probably step up for speed
 ddreams: many in a day
 eulerscheZahl: but features are there I think
 Marchete: good
 dbf: omg, mcts! eulerscheZahl do you have a holiday today?&#160;:)
 Tuan2.le: and a day may have several turns right?
 Marchete: mcts&#160;!= monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: i took off the whole contest period
 dbf: yep, monte catlo
 eulerscheZahl: now that i know the game i see it as a mistake
 ddreams: why?
 eulerscheZahl: spent half the morning on youtube and watching Monk :D
 dbf: will your boss aprove cancel of part of your vacation?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i'm still not convinced that I like the game
 Marchete: why not
 RockyMullet: it's kind of boring tbh...
 eulerscheZahl: i think i could cancel it but I won't
 Tibu_9405: tennis
 RockyMullet: I only coded for an hour so far, cause I'm not motivated, another mostly optimisation contest with very little interaction between players
 eulerscheZahl: after all we have a release at work soon, end of beta testing (completely new program)
 eulerscheZahl: best time to take off
 dbf: yes, wise decision in this case
 eulerscheZahl: i'm the only programmer :rofl:
 RockyMullet: oh god only programmer
 dbf: so release will be postponed?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: it's on 21st I think
 kovi: i wonder why there was no additional element of poison tree or something
 struct: How long will the backlog be once you come back?
 eulerscheZahl: contest ends on 17th
 kovi: all of us see it so similarly: optim with low interaction
 eulerscheZahl: may future me deal with this, i'm on holidays
 RockyMullet: kovi yeah would be nice to have some kind of pvp
 eulerscheZahl: afk, getting hungry
 struct: I agree with you rocky
 Marchete: how's that different from UTTT?
 Marchete: for example
 struct: its just a different type of game
 AntiSquid: so like last contest kovi
 Marchete: but it's about placing stuff to cancel other's placement
 Q12: yeah
 kovi: exactly AntiSquid
 RockyMullet: yeah I didnt like last contest either lol
 RockyMullet: I was kind of hoping this one would be different
 AntiSquid: well last contest didn't have so much crap to take into account
 Marchete: mullets with lasers or similar?
 ddreams: last contest you needed to think about your library of spells though
 RockyMullet: a mullet with lasers&#160;??? :O
 AntiSquid: the shadow mechanic is the most annoying bit 
 ddreams: this seems simpler than the last one
 LLG: have anyone tried to sim the opponent as well?
 RockyMullet: yeah much easier barrier of entry for sure
 Q12: I like the game - "A code of ice and fire", very nice thinking game and it is not about building a good sim
 LLG: or is it just more time optimized to sim your moves
 AntiSquid: haha, ddreams how so? you need to take into account costs and shadows and day cycle and tons of other stuff and you have to sim&#160;!!!
 RockyMullet: much easier to visualize also
 AntiSquid: you need sim for ice and fire too 
 ddreams: I mean, checking for shadows is a few lines of code
 ddreams: cost is very simple
 ddreams: no need to get different types of resources
 Marchete: it's costly on cpu time
 Q12: AntiSquid, I am in place 57 and not simulating a few turns ahead
 Q12: Maybe I should? :sweat_smile:
 DomiKo: Marchete  shadows are very simple
 DomiKo: if you do it right
 Marchete: bitwise?
 struct: mine is under 10 loc
 DomiKo: ofc
 AntiSquid: Q12 contest time is less than 24H, also i guess you found some good basic move selection
 Marchete: then it's not "simple"
 Marchete: staggering bitboard
 Marchete: shifts etc etc
 DomiKo: very simple not easy :sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: can't wait to see PM on bitwise approach, it seems really frustrating to me
 Q12: AntiSquid Yeah
 AceTea: la richesse des cellules est fixe aussi&#160;?
 Marchete: AntiSquid I'm trying <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Staggered-hexagonal-encoding-inherently-separates-each-row-in-the-bitboard_fig3_279031895">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Staggered-hexagonal-encoding-inherently-separates-each-row-in-the-bitboard_fig3_279031895</a>
 AntiSquid: #fr monsieur AceTea
 AceTea: sorry
 Marchete: shadows are shifts with || operators
 Marchete: but I won't say that's simple
 Nerchio: this is one of those games where getting legend will require reading research papers
 Marchete: for top50 players? yes
 Nerchio: :joy:
 ddreams: funny, I went to uni with the guy who wrote that paper
 AntiSquid: that one isn't less confusing than what i am tryng to do Marchete&#160;:/
 ddreams: we played Hex
 Marchete: it's confusing?
 DomiKo: you need to map hex to 2D and it will be much simpler to think
 kovi: rotating shadow is hard, but i think seeding is harder for bitboard
 AntiSquid: complicated, hard to keep track of variables i mean
 DomiKo: kovi true
 struct: kovi create masks for seeding
 DomiKo: struct you can't do random seed move really fast&#160;:(
 Marchete: why not
 Marchete: smits shared some random bit selector some time ago
 Marchete: from uint64_t, pick a random 1
 kovi: yeah, that is easier part
 Marchete: what's the hard?
 kovi: generating 3 range seed field
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: ok
 TobiasA: ayyyy i am now in bronze league that took so long
 struct: so create a mask for the middle
 struct: it can seed everywhere at size 3
 struct: and then shift it &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;
 struct: and then you create the lookup&#160;:)
 Marchete: but how do you move the mask?
 Marchete: to N bits?
 struct: I dont anymore
 struct: I use lookup for masks
 kovi: but than you should check each slot
 kovi: you cant do it for the whole board once
 struct: yeah, I check every bit
 struct: is it possible to do all the board at once?
 kovi: or vica versa...you can shift boards of tree3 in all directions, but that requeres dozens of steps
 Marchete: even if you do
 Marchete: you'd need sourceID
 Marchete: no?
 DomiKo: "is it possible to do all the board at once?" for range 1 yes
 kovi: you can get id "late"
 DomiKo: for range 2? yes too
 DomiKo: for range 3? not really
 struct: What is different for range 3?
 DomiKo: you can do it but it's slow
 kovi: yes. shadow goes in only one direction. but this 6^3
 DomiKo: yap
 struct: wait we are talking about seed or shadow?
 kovi: so probably better handling onebyone (as struct mentioned)
 Marchete: seedmask &lt;&lt; bitTree
 Marchete: probably simpler
 kovi: yes. either way its much slower than the usual x*x game bitboarding
 Marchete: I thought shadow will be expensive, but you are right, seeding is
 Marchete: and I need to avoid overlap on borders
 Marchete: I don't have dist 3 on edges
 kovi: that might be masked somehow
 kovi: 8x8 has no dist either
 Marchete: are you ignoring the enemy?
 Marchete: as some are using beam search
 struct: yes
 DomiKo: that could change in future
 Marchete: that's a bold move let's see if it pays off
 struct: it probably will
 struct: As I mentioned before, I tested in the void
 jrke: struct are you using beam search?
 struct: yes
 kovi: beam is good in case of low interaction..,like for fall contest
 jrke: ^+1 i agree
 jrke: only learn and brew were affected
 struct: also algos like smitsi are impossible here
 Marchete: nothing is impossible
 kovi: but im sure top will need more...because tiny differences in shadow can change total outcome
 yoannCaplain: I loose because I timeout&#160;:(
 yoannCaplain: that's harsh
 Hasuzawa: consdiering the game is deterministic, wouldn't the only deciding factor for neraly perfect bots be the only random factor: i.e. starting terrain and shadow direction
 kovi: i would opt for smitsi ...
 ddreams: smitsi is what?
 jrke: btw how can we prove that more than 20 trees can't be completed?
 yoannCaplain: all my looses are timeouts, so my AI is not bad, I need to optmize
 Marchete: UCT forest
 struct: jrke it can be completed
 struct: I did it before
 kovi: in my precalc, 20 is possible
 kovi: (theoretical precalc)
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/547788229">https://www.codingame.com/replay/547788229</a>
 jrke: so why they just provided 20 nutrients if more than 20 can be completed? struct
 struct: because its fine
 ddreams: richness is always valid
 struct: ~ 
 Marchete: +richness
 struct: ^
 Marchete: v
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: you can verse yourself?
 ddreams: if you're good at poetry
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lmao
 jrke: so nutrient will become 0 after 20 completion or anything else?
 struct: yes
 Marchete: note to self, use nutrient as signed
 Vimes: anyone else having problems with the c++ starter code? its not reading all inputs it seems
 ddreams: no, it worked fine
 ddreams: you probably output more than one line
 ddreams: or don't read all the input
 Vimes: i'm using the blank starter kit and get the warning where it says that not all input is read
 Nerchio: guys don't say you need to predict your opponent dont have time to write that&#160;:
 The_ZimaBlue: when will silver league come to the spring challenge?
 Nerchio: The_ZimaBlue Monday
 DomiKo: 5/10/21
 Nerchio: Domiko how many states you calculate in connect4?
 RoboStac: Vimes - looks like the starter only handles wood 2, the part where it reads possible actions doesn't read the extra indexes on "GROW" / "SEED" actions
 Tuan2.le: i cant understand what happens in Spooky Shadow
 ddreams: nothing happens in the shadow
 struct: you dont get sun points
 Marchete: spooky == no sun points
 Tuan2.le: can i grow up the tree lane on the spooky cell&gt;
 Tuan2.le:&#160;??
 ddreams: yes
 Tiramon: spooky just effects gettings suns
 ddreams: sorry, my joke might have been confusing
 CylonSpace: will there be another rule in silver&#160;? or bronze rules are the last ones&#160;? 
 Tuan2.le: so, just no sun point right
 Tuan2.le: thanks
 DomiKo: Nerchio i'm not prting it?
 Tuan2.le: this game is so fun
 DomiKo: Nerchio i'm not printing it?
 Tuan2.le: sun direction will change in next day right?
 DomiKo: yes
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I only just realized it gives you a list of possible actions. I have been coding the whole day
 KalamariKing: Does the list persist in higher leagues?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: no clue
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: bronze rules are final
 Tuan2.le: should i collect Size3 ASPS?
 Tuan2.le: ASAP
 ddreams: no
 Marchete: I don't think so
 Nerchio: in wood2 or wood1 why not
 struct: my vs is all messed up after power went out&#160;:/
 KalamariKing: awwh rip
 Illedan: Send me your code and I can test it
 ddreams: generous offe
 struct: Do you also need the referee?
 ddreams: r
 struct:&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: don't do it it's a trap
 struct: Im sure you will beat it soon enough
 struct: If you already didnt
 struct: new meta <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/547818141">https://www.codingame.com/replay/547818141</a>
 struct:&#160;?
 ddreams: nice
 kovi: heuristic meta
 kovi: lets wait for search based metas
 jacek: :scream:
 kovi: oh jacek is here, than i ping: nn based meta&#160;;)
 jacek: could be first contest when i bother writing simulator
 Marchete: what meta?
 kovi: keeping suns
 KalamariKing: Why would you write a simulator from scratch tho? Isn't the source on github?
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: I see
 jacek: KalamariKing you still need make move and undo move
 ddreams: or put the entire state on stack
 jacek: still you need to see how state changes after making move
 ddreams: yeah, but you don't need to undo it :p
 Marchete: I almost never undo in gamestates
 KalamariKing: But couldn't you modify source? instead of writing from scratch?
 struct: I have undo but dont use it
 Marchete: you can
 Marchete: but you get what you see
 ddreams: source is in Java though, and not optimized
 OldJohn: So struct do you have copy&#160;:-)
 jacek: eeyup
 struct: What do you mean OldJohn?
 OldJohn: If you are not undoing perhaps you are copying states&#160;?
 struct: yes
 KalamariKing: How complex would it be to write the sim?
 KalamariKing: I haven't done anything like this before and I don't wanna start if its too complex and would take me a few days
 Marchete: Buffer.MemoryCopy(A, B,sizeof(Board),sizeof(Board));
 Marchete: problem solved
 OldJohn: I hope you do not have pointers in A&#160;:-)
 StyllyMyle: Whats the use of nutrient
 Marchete: ofc
 KalamariKing: StyllyMyle its the base point value for completing a tree
 StyllyMyle: Wait whtaT?
 StyllyMyle: KalarmariKing wa
 ddreams: when you complete a tree, you get nutrient + richness score
 KalamariKing: If you have 20 nutrients, completing a tree yields 20 points plus the tree's richness score
 KalamariKing: And then nutrients -= 1
 StyllyMyle: SO its basically richness
 KalamariKing: Yes and no
 StyllyMyle: increase harvested point
 KalamariKing: Richness is per cell
 KalamariKing: Nutrient is per game board
 KalamariKing: Richness can't change, nutrient does
 StyllyMyle: The tree planted on cell have varying points?
 Marchete: richness change
 KalamariKing: Depending on the cell's richness yeah
 StyllyMyle: which is variable of nutrient?
 StyllyMyle: Now i see
 ddreams: so if your opponent completes before you, they receive more from the nutrient points
 KalamariKing: Each CELL has richness. Each GAME has nutrient
 StyllyMyle: Uh i see
 KalamariKing: The score for completing a tree is nutrient + richness score
 StyllyMyle: Richness of single tile
 OldJohn: nutrient is decreased after the two players moves&#160;?
 KalamariKing: Nutrient is decreased when a tree is finished
 Marchete: no I'm wrong
 ddreams: richness never changes, apart from being unusable, right?
 KalamariKing: Right
 Marchete: I thought richness changed
 OldJohn: Yes you are wrong&#160;!
 struct: only nutrients change
 KalamariKing: As far as I'm aware richness does not change
 struct: if 2 players complete in same turn it decreases by two
 struct: but both players get full points
 KalamariKing: Richness is the color of the cell (more rather, vice-versa)
 OldJohn: ok @struct it makes sense
 Marchete: so I don't need richness bitboard
 KalamariKing: I store the richness in the individual cells
 struct: I have richness bitboard anyways
 struct: but is static
 Marchete: I can set as static
 Marchete: that
 struct: it might be usefull&#160;;)
 StyllyMyle: btw
 StyllyMyle: I know both c++ and python
 KalamariKing: Epic
 Marchete: but with cellID it seems faster
 Marchete: useful for what?
 StyllyMyle: but currently im doing python as i like it better
 struct: eval
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: true
 Marchete: yes
 StyllyMyle: should i change to cpp for future leagues?
 Tuan2.le: So, any ideal which turn should collect Size3?'
 KalamariKing: Depends
 KalamariKing: That's the strategy part
 ddreams: Tuan: the turn that gives you the most point over the entire game
 StyllyMyle: Someone care to tell me? Should i program this in cpp if i am aiming for top 10 and under
 KalamariKing: Depends
 KalamariKing: There are a LOT of python players
 StyllyMyle: Ye
 KalamariKing: And python is slower, so something like a nn would time out
 Tuan2.le: so, i must predict that turn-most point over the entire game?
 StyllyMyle: But basically there is so many variables and so much actions
 Nerchio: my prediction is it will be hard to be in legend with python
 StyllyMyle: I somehow thing slowness of python will be neglected
 StyllyMyle: think*
 ddreams: I predict the language distribution will be like the last contest
 MSmits: ^
 StyllyMyle: Hm
 KalamariKing: StyllyMyle right, but if it is TOO slow, it will time out, limiting what you can do to simpler algos
 StyllyMyle: Hm yea
 StyllyMyle: Python is born slow
 ashelkov: lets go to legend with javascript
 StyllyMyle: like 100x slower
 Marchete: top10 and under won't have doubts about what lang to use
 KalamariKing: Tuan2.le Yes, but also your future strat depends on your current strat (shade, sun points, etc) so you have to evaluate that too
 ddreams: there was a python bot in the 34th spot
 StyllyMyle: hehe marchete&#160;:)
 StyllyMyle: Ok im changing language
 MSmits: top 10 and under is everyone...&#160;?
 Recovery_disaster: Will the grid layout (index, richness) always be same same? So does it make sense to hardcode the graph&#160;?
 ddreams: yes
 jacek: index yes. richness is per game
 ddreams: or initialize it first round
 MSmits: graph?
 MSmits: who needs graph&#160;:)
 Nerchio: richness is the same always except richness 0 isnt it
 ddreams: yeah
 KalamariKing: Recovery_disaster it will be different between games, but it is static per game
 Hoyer: MSmits how's your bot coming along
 MSmits: the difference in richness and starting positions is just enough so you can't hardcode your starts
 MSmits: Hoyer it's ok, just working on my search. Hopefully have a fully working bot at the end of the day
 Recovery_disaster: the distance is important for me&#160;:)
 MSmits: think it'll be good enough for gold then
 Marchete: hows your bitboard going, MSmits?
 Thiesjoo: MSmits are you doing a full sim?
 MSmits: bitboard was done last night
 MSmits: easily 
 Marchete: seeding too?
 Marchete: wow
 MSmits: Thiesjoo yeah
 Thiesjoo: Hmmm
 MSmits: Marchete how do you mean seeding?
 MSmits: I just have a cell lookup
 MSmits: to look up where i can seed
 MSmits: it returns a uint64_t with all locations that are seedable
 Marchete: but then you need to traverse tree by tree
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: there is no way to avoid that
 Marchete: maybe you could
 jacek: you can make lookups for that no?
 Marchete: I mean you as bitmaster :D
 MSmits: there are too many possible tree configs and seed sources
 MSmits: it wont fit in 800 MB for surre
 jacek: "hold my hex beer"
 Marchete: you are fast :D
 MSmits: I just wanted to avoid using a graph
 Marchete: I'd finish by june
 MSmits: and easily counting trees
 MSmits: _builtin_popcountl
 MSmits: the graph should work fine though, it's not like my way of doing this is a big deal in winning chances
 Illedan: Random Forest algo should work here :D
 Marchete: I just keep a count[] array :D
 MSmits: it's more about the search and eval here
 KalamariKing: How much memory can you use
 MSmits: 780 MB or so
 struct: I use __builtin_ctzll with masks for seeds
 jacek: 768mb
 Tiramon: KalamariKing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 MSmits: struct i use that to loop over trees
 Marchete: yeah, the loop using ctz
 struct: and to extract the bits indexes?
 MSmits: honestly, dont worry too much about bitboarding this. It's not worth it if you're not familiar with it
 MSmits: struct yes
 Tiramon: nice struct you still have 90% wins&#160;:)
 MSmits: just make your state somewhat compact so you can have many of them and not be too slow
 struct: thanks
 struct: It wont last much longer
 Marchete: compact like 80bytes+?
 Tiramon: yes bots are improving fast
 KalamariKing: Tiramon thanks
 MSmits: Marchete my state is around 60 bytes, maybe a little less
 MSmits: didnt check how its packed with the uint8_ts and all that
 MSmits: but if you make it 120 bytes or something it should not matter that much
 MSmits: memory wont be limiting here, its just caching will be a bit slower with larger states is all
 Marchete: I won't pack a lot
 struct: mine is 120 I think
 struct: I didnt really care about size
 Marchete: like uint8_t :1 nor anything near
 Marchete: going C#
 MSmits: yeah i just naturally make things small because i am used to that. 
 struct: my scores, suns, nutrients are all floats
 MSmits: from all the boardgaming
 MSmits: it's all uint8_t for me :0
 Marchete: int8_t wait0;
 Marchete: :sunglasses:
 Marchete: let's waste bits!
 MSmits: i actually have bools for those currently
 MSmits: but i guess they can be 1 bit&#160;:)
 Marchete: I also will have counts[8];
 Marchete: maybe I can popcount
 Marchete: but maybe it's more expensive
 MSmits: I have counts[4] with uint64_t owner
 MSmits: = smaller
 MSmits: brb walking dog
 kovi: illedan: i like random forest idea
 kovi: but monte carlo tree search is also good
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 ddreams: in what game would using random forest be more appropriate?
 struct: I also have mcts implemented
 struct: but didnt work aswell as bs
 Murat_Eroglu: what is bs?
 Illedan: bullshit
 struct: beam search
 kovi: yes, smitsi is the way to go, between bs and mcts
 struct: I think MSmits will disagree
 Tiramon: oh nice some small adjustment with shadows put me back in the top100
 Tiramon: *top10
 Marchete: struct, you are 2nd
 struct:&#160;:'(
 Tiramon: :eyes:
 Thiesjoo: :eyes:
 Tiramon: and just because you got divided by zero
 Nerchio: :eyes:
 Tiramon: hey almost 24h
 Sakisan: :eyes:
 Marchete: people are fast
 struct: Guess its time to start coding again
 Nerchio: 3 pythons in top6 is nice to see, it wont last long though
 Marchete: I'm still at hello world
 struct: Guess its time to submit my better version :evil:
 Marchete: this isn't your final form
 Shadowcool: hi
 Dr-D: The final forms are submitted on the last hour or so =D
 struct: I dont really have another version&#160;:(
 struct: I have but has similar win ratio 
 Thiesjoo: Time to write one than
 Dr-D: 2nd is fine&#160;;)
 Marchete: lol
 struct: its like 50 vs 50 against this one
 Marchete: CGBenchmark then
 Dr-D: To make you feel better struct: I m #2353
 Dr-D:&#160;;)
 Marchete: playing against yourself sometimes is overfitting
 struct: at least I was beaten by a c++ bot
 Illedan: lvl 3 smurf?
 Illedan: reCur se again?
 Dr-D: The game is on! There are 10 Dart solutions O.o
 struct: Maybe 
 Marchete: I'd say no
 Marchete: smurfs use weird countries
 struct: is germany weird?
 Dr-D: It is!
 Dr-D: I should know =/
 struct: Ok, its finally over
 struct: I was hoping my bot would last 8 hours it passsed
 kovi: chokudaisearch is taking over
 struct: chokudai is like expandable beam search right?
 DomiKo: yes
 Bleki: does anyone having issue with the visual game part not loading in the browser but having a gray rectangle?
 DomiKo: struct fixed depth, not width
 struct: ok I might give it a try
 StyllyMyle: Hey
 struct: So from i read now it reaches end then increased with
 struct: then go again
 struct: and so on
 StyllyMyle: anyone having problem with c++ template code
 struct: is that it?
 Marchete: that makes any sense?
 KalamariKing: Bleki yeah, what fixed it for me was force-closing the browser and force-clearing its cache
 kovi: bleki, try with different browser maybe?
 KalamariKing: other people suggest turning off and then back on hardware acceleration
 Tiramon: bleki is a problem with an outdated animation lib and chorme that should be updated soon
 Marchete: it isn't a worse MCTS-EPT?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mayoko/library/blob/master/ChokudaiSearch.cpp">https://github.com/mayoko/library/blob/master/ChokudaiSearch.cpp</a>
 StyllyMyle: I am using c++ template, and in the compute_next_action the first time func is called, all values and data is invalid
 StyllyMyle: or null ptr
 Tiramon: yes also heard that hardware acceleration should be a solution
 KalamariKing: are you running your search algos on every possible move? (or at least ruling out horrible moves?) Or are you running only a subset, like only a few cells or only 'complete'
 eulerscheZahl: hey struct you are at 2nd place
 struct: I know euler&#160;:(
 Tiramon: yes he got divided by 0
 AntiSquid: oh another alt
 KalamariKing: anti whom
 KalamariKing: Also, with your search algos whatever they may be, do you play out to the end of the game, or only n days ahead
 adamek123123123: i need help
 adamek123123123: add me on discord
 adamek123123123: WolfGamer#0027
 AntiSquid: no
 adamek123123123: yes
 eulerscheZahl: at the moment I play to the end to count my suns
 eulerscheZahl: but will probably change that
 eulerscheZahl: applying actions in the current + next turn only
 AntiSquid: call your doctor instead
 Tiramon: ask your question or you will still need help, else ask your question in the cg discord channel adamek123123123
 KalamariKing: So what's the difference between monte carlo and beam? correct me if I'm wrong but isn't beam just monte carlo, but only keeping the n best moves?
 AntiSquid: @_@
 Marchete: monte carlo = do n random moves keep the best score
 Marchete: beam search = play 1 turn, sort all sims by score, keep N best
 Marchete: repeat N times
 eulerscheZahl: repeat M times
 AntiSquid: Kalamari <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://i2.wp.com/www.russianfilipinokitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/crispy-fried-calamari-01.jpg">http://i2.wp.com/www.russianfilipinokitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/crispy-fried-calamari-01.jpg</a>
 Marchete: M
 Marchete: true
 Marchete: I think I confused you more
 AntiSquid: you answered your own question
 KalamariKing: Could you create a pseudo-blend with beam search, but going a few turns into the future
 KalamariKing: Marchete surprisingly I'm keeping up
 AntiSquid: where's your bot?
 Marchete: just go beam search
 KalamariKing: mine? not on the leaderboard, probably
 Marchete: play all moves, keep N best
 Marchete: then go to the next depth
 Marchete: and do the same 
 KalamariKing: I had one in Python but Python sucks for search algo's so I switched to java. since I'm having trouble implementing the python code into java, I'm rewriting but this time with a search algo
 KalamariKing: By play moves, you mean actions, right? and keep whatever gets the highest arbitrary score, determined by suns, actual score, etc? Do other factors go into determining the 'best' move, like future shade potential?
 KalamariKing: I'm way overthinking this aren't I
 Marchete: it could be
 Marchete: like directional neighbours 
 Marchete: eval is a tricky thing
 KalamariKing: I think I'm gonna start simple and I can add params later
 Marchete: exactly
 KalamariKing: I haven't gotten out of wood 1 yet so I think I've got a while to go
 Marchete: it seems that turn==0 is grow tree 1
 shashwat986: Do all the good players run something like monte carlo?
 Marchete: then go to center
 shashwat986: I'm building a simple rule-based scoring engine
 KalamariKing: Alright well thank you all, this has been very informative
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo is a very primitive search, it will get more sophisticated at the top
 eulerscheZahl: currently you can probably still climb up without any search
 eulerscheZahl: but it will definitely change during the contest
 eulerscheZahl: 9 days to go
 KalamariKing: I just don't wanna pour hours into building a bot, just to have to scrap it and pour another 3 days into it
 klmn: how did they manage to print info (the coordinates)?
 KalamariKing: I'd rather grind it now, improve it later
 klmn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/467342481">https://www.codingame.com/replay/467342481</a>
 KalamariKing: klmn if you add anything after the command and potential info, it will get displayed there (e.x. "WAIT info" will display "info", "GROW cellid info" will display "info", etc)
 KalamariKing: oh youre in a different game
 Recovery_disaster: Just put it at the end of your commands
 klmn: yea, different game, but should be same idea
 klmn: oh ic, thx
 KalamariKing: idk, debug mode maybe? its in the game player window thing settings if its available
 Scarfield: many games on CG has the option to output "expected output" + " " + "your message"
 KalamariKing: Oh sick
 KalamariKing: I thought that was unique
 Erzow: Hey, i have a problem with the  100 ms limit per turn. I reset my timer at 0 every turn but at 0,070 ms it "crash" because i exceeded the time limit&#160;? Any idea&#160;? 
 Scarfield: when do you start your timer?
 struct: you dont start the timer at the right place
 Scarfield: it should be started right after reading the first input
 Erzow: I start it just before the parsing every start of turn
 KalamariKing: Are the cells in the middle always safe or will they get blocked up
 Scarfield: thats why then, start it after reading the first input&#160;:)
 Erzow: Well,  if i start earlier i should have less time so doesnt really make  sense
 KalamariKing: Erzow I think there's a little overhead with whatever language you're using
 KalamariKing: try starting it as soon as you can in execution
 Scarfield: 2 bots compete, your time starts when you get the input, if you start a timer before that, you are starting the timer before the referee thinks its your turn
 Erzow: Scarfield, if i start the timer before the parsing, than it mean that i will  stop my simulation at 99 or less. I can put it just after i read the first input but it will be worth
 Erzow: worse*
 v1993: I'd like to ask - where can I suggest improvements to template generation for specific language?
 ErrorRazor: You're starting your timer before your turn has actually started
 KalamariKing: Your timer could also just suck
 jacek: lets build it into vacuum cleaner then
 Scarfield: hm misread your first comment Erzow, to utilize all the time you get, you should change when you  start the timer. but this could maybe be you hit an infinite loop after 70ms. But i guess you errorprint a lot, that takes time and might be the issue
 ntsd: What happen to go starter on spring challenge
 KalamariKing: they probably decided go was gross
 struct: losing points for winning matches&#160;:(
 jacek: and yet theres js starter
 KalamariKing: You have a point
 jacek: struct i know that feel from stome games
 jacek: some even
 Scarfield: some odd
 Zanoshky: Hey struct,  what kind of algo did you fo with?
 struct: beam search
 Erzow: Yeah it might be errorprint,  i dont think i hit an infinite loop after 70ms because all 20 first round are fine, thx for the help Scarfield ^^
 Zanoshky: thanks mate!
 jacek: youre welcome, check
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I thouught there was too much interaction between players for it work (shadows, seed planted = void space taken)&#160;?
 CEE-JAY: hi
 struct: I ignore that enemy can make actions darkhorse64
 ZarthaxX: darkhorse64 maybe its true but for now you can get high ignoring him
 CEE-JAY: hello
 Scarfield: thats some blissfull ignorence getting from it 
 Scarfield: *high from it
 darkhorse64: for a bs, i guess so. Like the previous contest, you don't need to go too deep because the sim is completely unvalid after a few moves
 AntiSquid: ignorance* ScareAByte
 AntiSquid: Scarfield
 AntiSquid: funny username though, accidental ping sorry
 Scarfield: sorry for being ignorant
 CEE-JAY: hahaha
 Scarfield: np, muted the site long time ago&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Sunny here, code will have to wait
 CEE-JAY: let have a clash guys
 eulerscheZahl: during a contest?
 darkhorse64: :scream:
 Illedan: Ever?
 eulerscheZahl: treason!
 AntiSquid: ban&#160;?
 darkhorse64: :hammer:
 ZarthaxX: darkhorse64 you are crazy
 Astrobytes: Did someone say ban?
 ZarthaxX: social life = null by these times
 darkhorse64: why
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes get him!
 Scarfield: xD
 ZarthaxX: darkhorse64 im kidding, i would do the same
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 ZarthaxX: its also sunny here, perfect for taking a walk
 ZarthaxX: contest drains your life
 darkhorse64: fresh air is good for brain cells and growing trees
 ZarthaxX: this man got a point
 darkhorse64: I'll write the code while cycling
 Astrobytes: It was sunny here but then I washed some clothes. now it's raining.
 darkhorse64: afk
 Scarfield: yea weather here is trolling as well
 jacek:  
 ill-be-waiting-outside: hi 
 martinpapa69: the dormant flag is cleared when day&#160;% 6 == 0&#160;?
 martinpapa69: i cant find it in the source
 eulerscheZahl: what are you talking about
 ddreams: dormant is cleared every day
 Scarfield: "Performing this action impacts both the source tree and the planted seed. Meaning both trees will be dormant until the next day."
 eulerscheZahl: dormant is when that tree alraady had an action on the current day
 ddreams: there are many turns in a day
 MSmits: or 1
 eulerscheZahl: chat is so laggy i'm tempted to create an alt account
 ddreams: worked well after refresh here
 RoboStac: moderators get extra laggy chat as a bonus 
 martinpapa69: oh 6 x gameturns&#160;!= 1 day. 1 gameturn == 1day
 struct: I just keep a tab just for chat
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/BmQQwpa">https://imgur.com/a/BmQQwpa</a>find the scrollbar
 RoboStac: no, you can have many gameturns in a day - a day ends when both players wait
 struct: avatars donot even load for me
 struct: dont*
 eulerscheZahl: take your time and read the statement again Csipscirip
 kovi: nice new name csipcsirip!mc = heur
 kovi: mc ~= heur for eulerscheZahl
 martinpapa69: i never read the statement
 jacek: are you ceg alt?
 struct: Never read the statement
 cegprakash: lol
 AntiSquid: is that csipcsirip&#160;?
 miszu: hello all
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u don't have to reply here if u don't want to answer
 cegprakash: I don't know what u guys get by insulting someone
 cegprakash: if u can't help 
 cegprakash: please stay out
 jacek: oO
 struct: who insulted who?
 miszu: the spring challenge looks like a Catan game
 ddreams: both have hexes
 geppoz: miszu it was the same my first tought
 ddreams: anything else similar?
 miszu: resources gathering by quickly surverying the info
 ddreams: not really
 miszu: some richness going on there
 geppoz: richness of territory
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: can you plant on richness=0 squares?
 ddreams: nope
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh wow
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: didn't know that
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: no wonder my bot is shit on those maps
 ddreams: 0 for unusable cells. Nothing can grow on them.
 miszu: people will think I am old school but it's good to read the rules before starting to code
 geppoz: uhm not clear what happens to input when you sleep
 jacek: :unamused:
 ddreams: no need, chat will explain everything
 martinpapa69: ye but its rly long
 ddreams: it's clear, if you read it
 geppoz: next data received is the "day" int of the next day?
 ddreams: Players that are asleep do not receive input.
 geppoz: so after outputting "WAIT", your read action will unblock on the next "day" int, correct?
 miszu: btw any chess players that plays regularly on ches.com
 miszu: chess.com *
 martinpapa69: when both the game recieved a wait action from both players, the new day begins. IMO
 martinpapa69: -both
 Hasuzawa: I like this challenge, even crappy programmer like me who cant implement any algorithm can just plant and grow at best spots.
 DevLorenzo: A question
 ddreams: but from the perspective of your player the next day begins immediately
 jquivogn: miszu yes sure
 miszu: challenges are made for everyone, but you have to be a pro to reach high leagues
 DevLorenzo: On the game: CODERS STRIKE BACK - I just started playing. I'm Rank 1 in Wood 2. How can I rank up to Wood 1?
 DevLorenzo: Thank
 miszu: git gud
 ddreams: Try writing code
 miszu: but being git gud is superior than writing code
 DevLorenzo: I'm first
 ddreams: It should bump you up automatically soon
 casmith789: you have to wait until 100% of your games have been played if you are beating the boss then you will be promoted
 Scarfield: your score has to be higher than the boss score when at 100% submit
 dbdr: nice Illedan
 Mourfette: I've found a problem with the csharp starter kit, don't know if it's known. the sun and score inputs were reversed, so I started the game with a score of 0 and myu sun at 2
 Mourfette: inputs = Console.ReadLine().Split(' ');
 DevLorenzo: So if I'm first should I update my code or just continue to test in arena?
 ddreams: wait until all your matches have finished
 StyllyMyle: Guys
 StyllyMyle: Im using started cpp template and the player is saying ```Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.```
 casmith789: it is because you are printing out before reading all the input
 StyllyMyle: Yea
 StyllyMyle: i understand the meaning
 ddreams: or you output more than one line
 StyllyMyle: but im using starter cpp template without any modification
 RoboStac: the cpp starter has  a bug once you get past the first league - it doesn't read the possible actions correctly
 StyllyMyle: Exactly
 StyllyMyle: sit
 casmith789: save the actions to a string then output it at the end
 StyllyMyle: shit
 StyllyMyle:&#160;:(
 ddreams: what?
 Illedan: thx dbdr. Nothing good yet
 StyllyMyle: I am so wasting my time for this template
 ddreams: I used the starter code and had no such problems
 StyllyMyle: thanks for tellin theres bug
 jacek: oO
 StyllyMyle: Cpp?
 ddreams: yes
 StyllyMyle: weird
 casmith789: I used the cpp code and had that issue but it was because I was doing that 
 struct: Illedan stop&#160;:(
 ddreams: however, I got that error when I made a mistake
 AntiSquid: the IDE starter RoboStac&#160;?
 RoboStac: not the ide stub, the starter you can download from github 
 ddreams: Oh, ok, I don't know about that
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/starterAIs/starter.cpp#L94">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/main/starterAIs/starter.cpp#L94</a> &lt;-- only handles "COMPLETE" so when GROW/SEED are possible it fails
 ddreams: IDE stub is fine
 StyllyMyle: Eh
 StyllyMyle: Now i see
 StyllyMyle: welp
 AntiSquid: there's a d starter :o
 Tiramon: for some languages ...
 StyllyMyle: Starter code aint there for higher leagues?
 wlesavo: oh, they added cpp starter, yeasterday there were only 4 starters i believe
 StyllyMyle: i though they are giving templates
 StyllyMyle: so i can code without doing those boilerplate stuff
 StyllyMyle: nvm, i guess its time to PR the repo! Bye&#160;:)
 ddreams: First attempt at search: bot sleeps 100% of the time
 ddreams: sleepy boi
 Majeck: Could somebody link me to the CG calendar?
 Rag: we only get bronze boss the 10?
 ddreams: until then, you have struct as the boss
 Rag: true
 struct: im not first anymore
 struct: illedan should be
 ddreams: you'll always be first in my heart
 Illedan: Soon struct. 
 ZarthaxX: tm
 Illedan: Just found a bug
 ZarthaxX: already on second day??
 ZarthaxX: this dude and his GAs
 Illedan: Correct
 eulerscheZahl: he learned that from MK
 struct: I dont know GA&#160;:/
 jacek: i wonder if ms has nice way to print the board
 ZarthaxX: just use spaces
 AntiSquid: wow this code is ugly
 GeRiY: Hey gyus
 GeRiY: i have problem with test video
 GeRiY: its stop playing, but the code is executed by the way
 ddreams: gray?
 GeRiY: someone knows hot to repair it?
 GeRiY: if you said to me ddreams its not gray
 ddreams: tried to reload the page?
 jacek: do you get gray replay
 GeRiY: nope, i dont think so its needs
 Q12: I had it a bunch of time also, I click on the REPLAY AND SHARE button to open the test video on a new page
 ddreams: first rule of computer fixing: turn it off and on again
 miszu: and first rule of debugging: print statement everywhere with word ("HERE")
 Zanoshky: Can you find out if you and opponent targeted the same field?
 Mourfette: HERE1 HERE2
 Q12: :joy:
 ddreams: I guess you can tell that you didn't plant a tree there
 miszu: BAD HERE
 miszu: REAL HERE
 Mourfette: I nezed to find a better way to check adjascent cells at distance X because using the neighbors thing is aweful
 Mourfette: need*
 LePrat: Can a shadow of one of your tree cover another of your own tree&#160;? 
 Mourfette: yep
 miszu: Mourfette, you could precompute all distances given X
 LePrat: dammit
 Tiramon: Zanoshky you seed a tile and next turn it is not seeded
 Mourfette: shadows do not disciminate
 Mourfette: +r
 miszu: like a function that takes a grid and an X that returns a list of valid grids
 miszu: and you precompute all
 KalamariKing: Mourfette find some way to turn the spiral-indexing into 3d hexagon space; the cell adjacent to cell (x, y, z) is (x+1, y, z) or (x, y+1, z), etc
 ddreams: do you do that, Kalamari?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dropped 300 rank overnight, expected
 KalamariKing: ddreams planning to
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan makes an appearance
 KalamariKing: just gotta find the algo to transform between the two
 ddreams: you could also just precompute all the distance2 and distance3 neighbors on startup
 KalamariKing: should I factor in sun cost into my eval function or not?
 ZarthaxX: makes sense
 AceTea: is the cpp started kit working for you&#160;?
 AceTea: *starter
 ddreams: the IDE stub code worked well, but several have reported a problem with the starter AI code
 AceTea: that's what I thought
 ddreams: something about not reading grow/seed actions properly
 AceTea: I also have a similar issue with IDE stub code.
 ddreams: then you probably do something wrong
 ddreams: like outputting several lines, or no lines, or no endline
 ddreams: or breaking before all the input is read
 AceTea: Well, I was printing in the console the command´, I was sending GROW 26 but it was receving SEED 26 ** 
 AceTea: really strange
 ddreams: probably looking at a point after you have sent two commands already
 emh: hmm I actually donated to tree planting in India once. it's called Chauvery Calling and Sadghuru is the main advocate. so maybe it will help me win the contest ehehe
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 wlesavo: the question is if you xor and byte shift the seed will you get a pseudo tree
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 TobiasA: i am using sublime text so how can i print the debug stuff to the sublime text console 
 -oa-: hi all!
 DevLorenzo: hi
 KalamariKing: TobiasA I really don't know
 KalamariKing: I didn't think sublime could RUN the code
 struct: What is this stuff called, I cant remember. "#define _DEBUG"  "#define _MSC_VER"
 ddreams: preprocessor directives?
 KalamariKing: it says something to the preprocessor
 struct: thanks
 ddreams: I'd probably call them "defines", but that seems too obvious
 struct: yeah, but I want to set them on project level and couldnt remember the name
 KalamariKing: If I remember correctly, every time that 'variable' comes up it gets replaced with the constant it corresponds with
 KalamariKing: right?
 Nagatwin: it's a plain text replacement
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 Nagatwin: could be macros
 KalamariKing: That
 ddreams: more complicated than that too
 ddreams: as in the defines above
 ddreams: no replacement
 Nagatwin: true
 AeroFufel: Sometimes I get lower just by resubmiting the same strat. Which gives anxiety to touch anything... it's pain for my mind&#160;:(
 JohnnyLuke: find an opponent better than your bot that uses a static algorithm and just replay against them over and over changing your params
 Marchete: go Ille go!
 Maliamnon: AeroFufel - I went from 140 to 399 overnight by doing nothing - gotta improve!
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, last night I lost like 600 places from 600 to 1200
 MrFruit: yikes
 MSmits: mmh i think my action generator works now, tried a random action selection and all actions are legal. It just never completes a tree because there are so many seed actions
 MSmits: and grow too
 jacek: MSmits you have any neat way to print the board?
 Nagatwin: Got the samme issue
 ZarthaxX: i dont get how you do an action generator of this lol
 Nagatwin: I had to add some weight to grow wait and complete
 jacek: i have action generator too. now i need to make state change on action
 MSmits: just a neat way of printing a uint64_t bitboard in the shape of this map
 MrFruit: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/027800c2-d8cf-4e2c-8e71-eeb6b8deff87">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/027800c2-d8cf-4e2c-8e71-eeb6b8deff87</a>
 Marchete: how many actions, Smits?
 MrFruit: Oh the heck
 MSmits: in my case only 20 or so
 Nagatwin: you can have up to 37*37 ish seed actions
 MSmits: but thats because it never gets big trees either
 ZarthaxX: MSmits move generator doesnt fit in one variable i guess
 MSmits: with big trees, you can seed all over the place
 ZarthaxX: as there are 3 types
 MSmits: i just have an action type + action index
 ZarthaxX: lots of loops
 ZarthaxX: okey
 MSmits: enum for type
 ZarthaxX: but seeds needs 2 things
 ZarthaxX: action indx is both i guess
 Marchete: enum is for weaks :D
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: seedChild.actionIndex = seedOrigin + 37 * seedTarget;
 ZarthaxX: yeah thought so haha
 Marchete: type + idx0 + idx1 for me
 Marchete: each one 1 byte, I'm lazy
 MSmits: could put the type in there too i suppose
 MSmits: trying to keep it readable. Can always compress state further if i need to
 Marchete: to save 1 byte?
 Nagatwin: I mean, actions ain't too lmimiting in memory usually anyways
 ZarthaxX: but you enjd populating an array
 ZarthaxX: right
 Nagatwin: limiting*
 ZarthaxX: and then you just iterate it
 MSmits: yeah for now
 ZarthaxX: isnt it better to play actions on the moment you gnerate them?
 MSmits: i will convert this to a system where i generate child states for beamsearch
 ZarthaxX: i always thought it added complexity 
 ZarthaxX: i see
 MSmits: sure yeah for a tree based search
 Marchete: any kind of pruning?
 ZarthaxX: you want to prunne moves before applying?
 MSmits: i dont know yet, maybe
 Marchete: or letting the beam do the job?
 MSmits: can always hash stuff to remove duplicates
 ZarthaxX: aight
 Marchete: I see zobrist here
 ZarthaxX: but it was more of a general question, if you generally play the m,oves as you generate them
 ZarthaxX: or you do the array approach
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Marchete: like a big game state
 Hjax: good morning 
 ZarthaxX: hi Hjax&#160;:*
 Marchete: with few changes
 MSmits: ZarthaxX i play them as i generate them in minimax 
 ZarthaxX: excellent
 MSmits: but for bs you need to make a list and do nth element
 ZarthaxX: have you tried both alternatives?
 ZarthaxX: yes yes
 MSmits: for this contest i havent tried anything yet
 ZarthaxX: i mean beam search is done after you have the states tho
 ZarthaxX: but well
 MSmits: you get the states for many depth levels
 Marchete: do you prefer beam search over smitsi!?
 Marchete: sacrilegy
 MSmits: in this contest, probably yeah
 ZarthaxX: i dont get you lol
 ZarthaxX: i meant that in each depth you throw some states
 MSmits: yeah you do
 ZarthaxX: but thats AFTER applying the actions to actual state
 KalamariKing: What's smitsi
 MSmits: i copy state and apply action
 ZarthaxX: so i dont get why you say the list thing here
 Marchete: jk, smitsi is hard because of the move generation
 MSmits: well say you have 1000 states
 ZarthaxX: it can be done on the fly as you generate moves right?
 MSmits: and they generate 40k children
 ZarthaxX: sure sure
 MSmits: you dont know where the cutoff is
 MSmits: so you just store them
 ZarthaxX: but you mentioned a list
 ZarthaxX: thought list of actions
 struct: you cant beam and prune while applying
 MSmits: oh noes
 ZarthaxX: but you meant of states
 MSmits: not actions
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i dont make an action list
 MSmits: thats pointless
 ZarthaxX: you confused me coz you said
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/45d0dcbf-fed4-4b30-9c8b-ee06df9e11c9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/45d0dcbf-fed4-4b30-9c8b-ee06df9e11c9</a>
 MSmits: yeah sorry
 ZarthaxX: you changed the thing you were talking about haha
 MSmits: probably yeah
 Nagatwin: MSmits is non deterministic
 Nagatwin: that's why
 ZarthaxX: okey
 MSmits: you mean fundamentally?
 Nagatwin: :nerd:
 MSmits: I have a fixed seed though
 Nagatwin: That's convenient
 MSmits: allright, now the scary part... coding the actual BS
 MSmits: It always feels messy, keeping two arrays and swapping pointers and such
 Hjax: i was messing with bitboards yesterday and just ended up frustrated with how messy it ended up
 Hjax: not as easy as bitboarding othello
 MSmits: takes a lot of getting used to Hjax.
 MSmits: othello isnt easy either
 MSmits: at least generating the moves isnt
 jacek: othello has bitboards codes and tutorial everywhere
 MSmits: if you want, i'll share my bitboard stuff after contest
 v1993: Is there actually much of a use for list of valid actions? It seems easier to just ignore them and compute thing yourself.
 AntiSquid: ok MSmits
 Hjax: my move gen for othello is pretty simple, its just dumb7fill 
 AntiSquid: setting reminder
 Marchete: I can share if I ever have one working
 Marchete: but it won't happen in a long time :D
 MSmits: it's not really anything fancy, my bb for this game. But it works and I like it. Most of you probably wouldnt like it
 AntiSquid: struggling a bit with shadow removal @_@
 KalamariKing: v1993 I am by no means good at this stuff, but I personally use that to evaluate valid moves. there's no use making your own if its already done for you
 Hjax: this game just seems like theres a lot of state, 8 bitboards just to represent trees, plus score, dormant trees, and sun points
 ZarthaxX: just some bytes
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Marchete: 4 tress + 1 playermask
 ZarthaxX: ^
 Marchete: trees
 AntiSquid: don't think they had bitboards in mind for this Hjax
 jacek: everything can be bitboarded if youre brave enough
 ZarthaxX: might not be efficient 
 Marchete: bitboard PCR :D
 Hjax: if i want to do any sort of reasonable search i need a fast board representation 
 MSmits: Hjax compared to other community contests the state is quite simple
 MSmits: but compared with boardgames it isnt
 AntiSquid: quite sure crystal rush was worse for bitboards
 Hjax: crystal rush was also worse for search
 Hjax: at least i wasnt doing any
 MSmits: CR was worse for sure
 kovi: hjax fast or compact?
 Hjax: i often think of those as the same thing 
 kovi: (ok bb usually have both, but may not here)
 kovi: and for bs compactness is also not so important than for tree searches
 MSmits: depends on the treesearch too
 MSmits: for minimax you dont need compactness
 MSmits: generally
 AntiSquid: hah even kovi calls this game bs
 MSmits: because you're not storing states
 MSmits: (like in mcts)
 MSmits: i should say nodes
 MSmits: that sometimes have states
 MSmits: I guess it's different with TT, then you need to store stuff with minimax as well
 MSmits: but TT often isnt worth it
 Hjax: you dont necessarily have to store state in mcts either, in othello i only store the move on my tree
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: i store the state on my tree in othello
 MSmits: because it's 128 bit, so pretty small
 kovi: yeah, it depends on cost of play action
 MSmits: yeah
 Machinist: Hi. I am new to programming
 MSmits: hi new to programming
 AeroFufel: Hi new
 Machinist: I am stuck in Coders Strike Back Bronze League
 Machinist: Can't get above rank 20,000
 ZarthaxX: Machinist playcontest
 MSmits: Machinist i would suggest you join he contest. Everyone is talking about it here
 AntiSquid: everyone is busy with contest
 Machinist: Any suggestions?
 ZarthaxX: leave that game
 MSmits: it's not really harder than csb
 Machinist: Okay
 AntiSquid: which makes CSB look like cake walk
 ZarthaxX: MSmits hex boards can scary people
 ZarthaxX: turn them off etc
 MSmits: hmm
 AntiSquid: lol def harder than csb
 MSmits: well the wood leagues are easy
 ZarthaxX: its easy for someone like u lol
 ZarthaxX: well...
 MSmits: you just loop over cells
 Thiesjoo: MSmits your simultion done yet? (:
 ZarthaxX: at least u got valid actions
 cegprakash: hi all
 AntiSquid: there's far less stuff to take into account in CSB
 struct: the game is not that hard
 MSmits: Thiesjoo yes sim is done, have to start on search
 Thiesjoo: Nice!
 Thiesjoo: That's pretty fast
 struct: Even I that dislike hex liked the game
 AntiSquid: we're comparing csb and the hex game
 MSmits: this game is not hard to sim compared to some
 gwolpi: Haai @Thiesjoo
 Thiesjoo: Heya Gwolpi
 ZarthaxX: MSmits agree :P
 ZarthaxX: excepto for shadows maybe
 AntiSquid: ok that's def not true struct, you do like hex
 ZarthaxX: tho traversing a hex board is annnoying too
 struct: Saying that csb is easier to sim than this is ridicolous
 MSmits: yeah thats true ZarthaxX, but i made lookups for shadows early
 ZarthaxX: same
 AntiSquid: mmm ok w/e
 ZarthaxX: easy life
 ZarthaxX: :D
 dreadylein: @struct depends, before refrees were published&#160;? harsh hehe
 KalamariKing: watching the people in my rank go up as my ranking goes down
 KalamariKing: why is beam search so freaking hard
 ZarthaxX: shouldnt be
 ZarthaxX: baby steps KalamariKing
 ZarthaxX: test each part that you code
 jrke: struct you got broked a lot
 jrke: 1st-6th
 KalamariKing: ZarthaxX I am but its taken me like 4 hours so far
 struct: it was a matter of time jrke
 KalamariKing: knowledge I now know: don't implement a complex search algo if you've never heard of them before the previous night
 ZarthaxX: KalamariKing i also take hours to do stuff
 MSmits: KalamariKing i spend days on some search algos. This beamsearch may also take me 4hrs if i get some hard to spot bugs
 ZarthaxX: but take it easy
 ZarthaxX: use the debugger
 ZarthaxX: check what you are doing
 ZarthaxX: use prints
 Joe_Mamba: dick bug
 ZarthaxX: ban
 Joe_Mamba: no
 Joe_Mamba: pls
 TiopazHc: banealo!! 
 TiopazHc: xd
 KalamariKing: ZarthaxX MSmits yeah but y'all know what you're doing, I don't
 ZarthaxX: oh peru boi
 ZarthaxX: KalamariKing we didnt know at some point
 ZarthaxX: you just have t persist
 MSmits: KalamariKing exactly, so thats why you should expect to take a bit more time&#160;:)
 Smelty: wait what i leveled up overnight
 VizGhar: to top guys already have their own referree implemented?
 MSmits: also, i didnt do beam search 100 times. I think it's 4 so far?
 VizGhar: (game turn simulation)
 MSmits: not a referee no... just the sim steps for my bot
 VizGhar: thats what I meant
 struct: I only did it previously on Fall challenge
 MSmits: yeah, but thats really not that hard
 VizGhar: I started today, so I want to know how far behind am i
 ZarthaxX: KalamariKing ask anything you want in chat
 Joe_Mamba: :poop:
 ZarthaxX: many good coders will help you
 Smelty: aaugh i still dont know what to do
 MSmits: some people will start on wednesday and zip past most players. "being behind"  is relative
 jrke: so MS did you started coding your algo?
 VizGhar: sure... I need to evaluate those shadows and then some super duper searching
 VizGhar: hope I can get to first 100 (and stay there)
 MSmits: jrke not yet... because i am chatting :P
 MSmits: but ... no sleep till beamsearch
 VizGhar: MSmits chat for another 10 days&#160;:)
 MSmits: even if it has a bad eval or something, i want to get top 100 or  so 
 jrke: oh so you are starting with beam search
 ZarthaxX: same smito
 VizGhar: Going for beam too...
 MSmits: yeah
 jrke: what about minimax
 ZarthaxX: delete account if we dont
 MSmits: it's a nobrainer imho
 struct: I just want legend
 struct: But I dont think I can
 VizGhar: jrke too much nodes maybe?&#160;:)
 MSmits: the problem with minimax here is that this game requires some long term planning
 VizGhar: Even top bots doesn't seem legendary now
 VizGhar: smits ++
 MSmits: beamsearch sacrifices on opponent prediction, but player interaction is weak in this game
 MSmits: like in HS
 ZarthaxX: you think so?
 Smelty: im trying to rewrite my whole code xD
 Marchete: triggered
 jrke: i calculated today and got to know there could be maximum of 38 unique moves
 VizGhar: week? u kidding?
 ZarthaxX: jrke minimum&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 jrke: maximum
 MSmits: it's weak yes.... mostly shadows and occupying hexes
 eulerscheZahl: weak*
 ZarthaxX: many trees can throw seeds to same cell
 LeviathanProgramming: the emojis quality is sad
 LeviathanProgramming: so blurry
 ZarthaxX: idk how you get 38
 struct: jrke you are wrong
 ZarthaxX: :P
 jrke: maybe
 VizGhar: ok weak :D but that weak interaction will be most crucial
 ZarthaxX: anyway its a big branching
 struct: If there is a middle tree of height 3 and o more tress
 struct: is a total of 39 actions
 kovi: getting into more deep - biggest interaction is completion (decrease of nutr.)
 struct: no more*
 jrke: but i calculated as you can't grow where you can complete or seed and vice versa = 1 for waiting
 MSmits: VizGhar indeed, when everyone does a beamsearch, the small additions they write to incorporate some opponent prediction will mean the difference
 Bennywinny: how i play
 struct: ah wait is 38
 ZarthaxX: really?
 jacek: 38, too much stargate eh
 eulerscheZahl: there are 37 tiles struct
 struct: 36 seedable + complet + wait
 eulerscheZahl: 36 SEEDs, 1 complete
 VizGhar: I can't imagine simply ignore enemy... maybe thats way it takes me so long
 ZarthaxX: seedable
 eulerscheZahl: 37 in total
 eulerscheZahl: oh WAIT
 ZarthaxX: but deciding which tree throws it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem">https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Fall2020-Challenge-Postmortem</a>
 ZarthaxX: DOES change
 VizGhar: *why
 eulerscheZahl: facepalm
 ZarthaxX: struct
 MSmits: I wasnt even in that contest, but Agades PM will help you
 struct: yes ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: if you got 2 tree that can seed same cells
 ZarthaxX: you dont account once
 jrke: but the matter is the tree you used to plant a seed also matters
 jrke: cause it becomes dormant then
 ZarthaxX: that's what im saying..
 ZarthaxX: cant be 38
 struct: I know its more
 struct: I saw 80 actions + when I tested the game
 ZarthaxX: oh god.
 ZarthaxX: but those are memes games maybe..
 MSmits: thats because when you get big trees, they can almost seed the entire map
 jrke: i saw 100+ yesterday in one replay
 ZarthaxX: O.O
 MSmits: and you can have like 5 big trees or so
 MSmits: typically
 ZarthaxX: was it a realistic scenario jrke?
 ZarthaxX: mmm
 Joe_Mamba: bruh
 ZarthaxX: scary 
 Joe_Mamba: bruh
 ZarthaxX: beam search save us!
 AntiSquid: msmits you were in fall contest, Automaton2000 tell him
 Automaton2000: to check if there is a chance of getting a good eval
 jrke: what about MCTS
 MSmits: AntiSquid not really, i did 4 hrs on the last day i think, just to get bronze
 Joe_Mamba: bruh
 jrke: though forgot that
 ZarthaxX: idk if it fits..
 ZarthaxX: i mean solo player mcts maybe?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 VizGhar: 3 level 3 trees in center gives you like 80 actions right?
 MSmits: yeah
 Joe_Mamba: bruh
 eulerscheZahl: more
 ZarthaxX: holy molly
 KalamariKing: Does it make sense that, in the very last day, that you complete all the trees you can
 Marchete: theorically
 Smelty: o.o
 Joe_Mamba: im to dum for this chat
 geio: stop spamming Joe
 VizGhar: I've only thrown some number
 eulerscheZahl: Joe_Mamba stop that "bruh"
 MSmits: KalamariKing you might want to complete them sooner for more nutrient
 VizGhar: Joe_Mamba I was too once&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: nothing to brag about Joe_Mamba
 KalamariKing: MSmits does the nutrient go up?
 Joe_Mamba: well then
 MSmits: but yeah it seems wasteful to have many halfgrown trees in the last day
 jrke: i am again confused like FC2020 that which algo to choose
 MSmits: goes down
 VizGhar: KalamariKing I'm at 421rank just growing trees and cutting them down in last turn
 Joe_Mamba: :expressionless:
 KalamariKing: VizGhar that was my plan, kinda
 KalamariKing: So it's not horrible? great
 Tiramon: damn you were faster
 MSmits: allright back to coding
 AntiSquid: well was going to do it last time, but hesitated
 eulerscheZahl: i was about to type that too
 eulerscheZahl: already had the /kick
 VizGhar: It's first algo I did when went to bronze... So it's poor in a way
 VizGhar: I wouldn't kick him... I don't understand why
 ZarthaxX: jrke try many
 AntiSquid: well i get bs PM now so ...
 joniebear: anyone else just getting grey screen instead of the game? 
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, taking one for the team
 eulerscheZahl: try another browser or changeteh hardware acceleration in your settings joniebear
 Bennywinny: bruh
 VizGhar: wonder how MCTS would perform here&#160;:) but you can most probably write some good evaluation for midgame too... I believe Beam is really way to go
 Hiboia: jesus
 KalamariKing: joniebear I did, fixed by disabling and then reenabling hardware acceleration
 jrke: the game really has lot of woodwork
 Hiboia: amunguusssssss
 VizGhar: ok, so good luck everybody... I'm gonna socialize
 KalamariKing: glhf
 KalamariKing: ggez those convos
 Hiboia: omg guys smash like button right now or i will smash ur mom
 KalamariKing: Hiboia can you not
 Hjax: a lot of real geniuses in chat today 
 Scarfield: xD
 KalamariKing: lmao ye
 AntiSquid: same guy for sure
 eulerscheZahl: i had the kick in my clipboard already and still lost&#160;:/
 Tiramon: school time in us right now? that would atleast explain it ...
 KalamariKing: yep
 Tiramon: i had it in the text field&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: its 11:30 on the east coast
 KalamariKing: so its like 8:30-11:30 across the us
 Hiboia: &lt;^..^&gt;
 Bennywinny: UNBAN JOE_MAMBAUNBAN JOE_MAMBAUNBAN JOE_MAMBAUNBAN JOE_MAMBAUNBAN JOE_MAMBA
 Bennywinny: UNBAN JOE_MAMBAUNBAN JOE_MAMBA
 Bennywinny: UNBAN JOE_MAMBA
 Tiramon: and again a teacher that is not watching what his class is doing
 ZarthaxX: wth
 Marchete: lazy teachers
 Marchete:&#160;;)
 Hjax: or study hall
 Tiramon: what i banned him before your mesaage appeared in chat ..&#160;:(
 Beerus: 'Any tree impacted by one of your actions becomes dormant for the rest of the day. A dormant tree cannot be the subject of an action.' that includes shadowing?
 joniebear: Alright, hardware accel off/on does it. 
 Hjax: Beerus does not include shadowing
 ZarthaxX: Beerus shadowed cells dont product sunpoints
 ZarthaxX: produce*
 ZarthaxX: only that
 KalamariKing: Beerus no, only the subject of a complete, grow, or seed
 eulerscheZahl: "have you tried turning it off an on again"
 Tiramon: shadowing is not a action Hjax
 AntiSquid: ok i see any bruh i autokick @_@
 eulerscheZahl: IT crowd uses that line for a reason
 Beerus: ok thanks
 Hjax: i know that Tiramon
 eulerscheZahl: bruh
 Tiramon: ups wrong name ...
 geio: lol
 AntiSquid: doesn't work, you lucky
 Hjax: :P
 Tiramon: atleast i didn mix it up while kicking&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm kick-proof
 Hjax: lol please dont kick me 
 Hjax: no "accidents" 
 geio: hurb
 AntiSquid: don't test my dyslexia geio
 Tiramon: kick is harmless ... bans not&#160;;)
 geio:&#160;:) cool
 KalamariKing: oof gotta take a test, brb
 Tiramon: calcing suns to gain is the hardest part to sim ...
 Marchete: it isn't the move generation?
 Marchete: the seeding part
 Hjax: one of the benefits of bitboarding is calcuating sunpoints isnt that hard 
 Tiramon: ups i missed the range check in seed, but that is easy to add ... atleast only one check
 Hjax: popcount(trees &amp; !shadowed) * tree_type_income
 kovi: told you....chukodai is taking over&#160;:)
 Marchete: chokudai
 kovi: 4 japan in top10
 eulerscheZahl: the user or the algo?
 Tiramon: sure if you got the shadows and source of shadow it is easy to calc suns
 dbdr: the algo IS the user
 Tiramon: but since a size 2 tree does not make a size 3 tree spooky it's a bit more complex
 kovi: when i saw first japanese, i assumed chokudaisearch
 Marchete: go 3 to 1
 AntiSquid: say his name 3 times and he'll appear on the leaderboard personally
 eulerscheZahl: *and he will tweet about it
 ddreams: Tiramon: a size 2 tree shadows a size 3 tree
 Hoyer: do u guys hold trees in a vector or in an array the size of the board
 eulerscheZahl: for now: List&lt;T&gt;
 Tiramon: but it doesn't make it spooky ... so 3 will generate suns
 eulerscheZahl: working on bitboards right now
 ddreams: pretty sure that's wrong
 AntiSquid: check statement
 Tiramon: just look at the picture at sun&amp;shadows ... the right one
 ddreams: hmm
 Tiramon: that's what is making it more complex&#160;;)
 giorgi1911: this is too hard
 eulerscheZahl: oops, I implemented that wrong
 giorgi1911: like I am stuck on first step
 ddreams: oh, wow
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Tiramon
 Tiramon: np =)
 Scarfield: forgot about that part, ty xD
 Tiramon: oh got an idea that should work easier
 optplx: hi guys do we know when silver opens?
 Scarfield: on monday, click the league next to your rank top left to see when next league opens
 optplx: ah thanks for the tips
 v1993: Woah, battling takes a real while
 v1993: Looks like contest is pretty popular, after all
 Wontonimo: just logged in and see that there are a lot more contestants.  Nice, that's good to see.  Yesterday I was thinking 2,200 contestants was kinda small
 Tiramon: ok shadow and sun isn't that complex ...
 eulerscheZahl: will grow further, don't worry
 eulerscheZahl: 4k already
 ZarthaxX: 4k people?
 ZarthaxX: wow
 eulerscheZahl: i'M not talking about my screen well, resolution
 Wontonimo: c++ rewrite and bitboarding here i come
 olaf_surgut: why i can't play with plp with &lt; 1000 ranking?
 eulerscheZahl: that "well" was supposed to be at the beginning
 eulerscheZahl: laggy chat results in blind typing
 olaf_surgut: *&gt; 1000
 eulerscheZahl: CG added that 1000 constraint so the list will load faster
 eulerscheZahl: was a quick fix that somehow remained
 Wontonimo: haha eulerscheZahl - i got it the first time
 Smelty: hi mr euler
 Tiramon: hm never wrote a sim that fast ...
 eulerscheZahl: hi Smelty
 Smelty: owo
 Smelty: completely rewrote my code from scratch, discovers its worse than my original
 Tiramon: you mean fix a bug, drop 50 ranks ... thats normal&#160;;)
 Smelty: no i reset my code and rewrote it
 Smelty: and it loses against my bot from before
 Smelty: soo
 emh: hmm.. it doesn't remember my code. I have to Send to IDE from last submission
 Smelty: hmm
 Tiramon: that happend yesterday when silver was opened by accident
 Smelty: switch to another lang and back
 Smelty: wait what
 Tiramon: emh they had to do some hard fixing&#160;;)
 Smelty: silver got opened? xD
 emh: ahh that worked. switching and back
 Tiramon: yes and everyone with a stable rank got promoted
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: perhaps thats why i leveld up overnight
 Smelty: the exp from league promotion?
 TheScreamingMonk69: hey everyone im new here and would like some help with coders strike back i dont rember how to code c++ its been a few years
 Smelty: first off, offset where you are going by 3 times your velocity
 Smelty: second, thrust 100
 Amanojaku: Hi
 Smelty: or slow down as you approach
 Smelty: hi amonojaku
 Smish314: how was 3x the velocity determined?
 Smelty: take ur velocity
 Smelty: if ur in lower leagues, just compare your current position to last times position
 Hiboia: sup
 Smelty: hi
 Hiboia: hi
 eulerscheZahl: thanks again Tiramon, that bugfix pushed me up a bit
 eulerscheZahl: now I can see you without scrolling
 Tiramon: glad i could help =)
 Tiramon: hope i get my sim running soon ... currently trying with a simple state and no bitboarding
 eulerscheZahl: too early in the contest for bitboards to take over
 ZarthaxX: are you challenging smito?
 ZarthaxX: :D
 eulerscheZahl: but I like the layout i've settled on&#160;:)
 Tiramon: yes i guess a simple slow sim should still be better than my current bot&#160;;)
 Smish314: I guess what I'm asking is how was it determined that the radius is 3x the velocity, not 3.2x?  Was it done by testing?  I was frustrated that there was no indication on how steering worked.
 eulerscheZahl: i have a simple slow sim. and poor scoring
 Tiramon: i got some ideas for a bitboard ... but first i want 'something' working&#160;;)
 Gagat: Not sure a bitboard will be that much faster
 Gagat: woops 
 Gagat: wrong account&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you're at 24 you seem to do well tiraptor
 Smelty: hhhhhhh
 Smelty: dang
 Tiramon: Smish314 there was a name for that thing if i got it right PI was even better than 3
 AntiSquid: tiramon *
 emh: Smish314 I guess it was done by experiments. I did a test once for different values and made a graph and stuff, it wasn't exactly 3 that was the best
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548138701">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548138701</a>
 pb4: I'm having trouble right at the last step
 Smish314: Tiramon and Emh, thanks.
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 = gagat?
 Tiramon: AntiSquid it's still only simple sostring and 1 if per command
 pb4: The referee tells me I have only one valid command
 pb4: (yes)
 Tiramon: *sorting
 pb4: Shouldn't the COMPLETE 36 be valid too&#160;?
 klopp: wow it's so funny
 Smelty: pb4
 Tiramon: only if there is a size 3 tree pb4
 Smelty: *hi 
 King_Coda: Hello Mates!
 Tiramon: and it is yours and not dormand
 King_Coda: Greetings Non-regulars!
 eulerscheZahl: that complete looks valid to me, yes
 King_Coda: (And regulars alike)
 pb4: It is mine, not dormant and size 3
 Tiramon: enough suns?
 pb4: complete doesn't require suns
 Tiramon: 4 suns
 Smelty: 4 sun it requires
 pb4: uh&#160;?
 pb4: sorry :D
 Tiramon: Completing a tree's lifecycle requires 4 sun points.
 Scarfield: " Complete actionCompleting a tree's lifecycle requires 4 sun points."
 Smelty: *quote*
 struct: complete requires 4 suns yeah
 AntiSquid: ah got anotjher one not reading statement
 Tiramon: i also always miss some parts&#160;;)
 Gagat: Damn, it's even the first sentence -_-
 eulerscheZahl: but you have 12 suns?
 Smelty: r  i p
 Smelty: thats weird-
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i checked the wrong frame nvm
 emh: Smish314 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://emh.lart.no/publish/csb/3vel/1.png">http://emh.lart.no/publish/csb/3vel/1.png</a>
 Gagat: Yeah, 1 sun in inputs
 Gagat: Thanks&#160;:)
 Tiramon: any got an idea how many suns a player got theoretically gather? so how many bits i need?
 Tiramon: *could
 Smish314: woah, emh, hardcore
 struct: well 2^16 is safe
 struct: 2^8 is not
 eulerscheZahl: you only need as many bits as YOU can gather
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you don't sim the opponent
 ddreams: 2^9 is safe, afaict
 ZarthaxX: is there an opp in this game?
 ZarthaxX: i dont see him
 Gagat: Do you really want to optimize for just a few bits&#160;?!
 Tiramon: yeah guess 9 or 10 bits should be enough even for worst horder
 struct: Isnt this bit stuff more epensive?
 fvla: ^
 Gagat: It can be&#160;:)
 fvla: saving bytes makes sense. saving individual bits really doesn't
 Tiramon: no not that relevanti use it for my state serializer to test states locally
 struct: yeah
 struct: ah
 ZarthaxX: oh lol
 Gagat: BitStream(c)
 Tiramon: the one that recurse wrote in a stream some time ago&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i still don'T get the hype about it
 Tiramon: think it was him ...
 eulerscheZahl: it was, locam
 Gagat: same euler
 Tiramon: yes right
 Tiramon: i like it to copy a state i see ingame to my local machine to debug, especially if it is in a rand game so not reproducable
 eulerscheZahl: just print the stdin directly to stderr, works fine as long as you don't have an internal state (fog of war)
 ZarthaxX: yep
 Smelty: dangit code is still failing
 ZarthaxX: literally that haha
 eulerscheZahl: and it's even readable and editable
 ZarthaxX: ^^^^{
 ZarthaxX: do it all the time haha
 Tiramon: i just remember it was important in locam because the err was truncated and there was alot of input ... 
 Tiramon: also i don't want to type all those cell neighbours&#160;;)
 ddreams: how many nodes are you guys evaluating?
 Tiramon: none right now
 Smelty:&#160;:(( i cant seem to get my trees to plant farther than 1 grid
 Tiramon: if you have a size 1 tree thats normal
 Tiramon: range = tree size
 TobiasA: what is the distance between two cells that are directly beside each other
 Tiramon: 1
 TobiasA: is it 0 or 1
 TobiasA: oh ok thanks
 therealbeef: when you are asleep, you do receive sunpoints, correct?
 ddreams: you only receive sunpoints on a new day
 ddreams: so only after you have slept, yes
 Tiramon: which happens when both players waited
 cegprakash: ddreams I woke up from my bed today but I didn't get any sun points
 cegprakash: I was sleeping in shade got it
 Tiramon: your bed must have been spooky
 cegprakash: no Tiramon coz I was sleeping in shadow
 Tiramon: you would have gotten suns if you were in shadows as long as it wasn't a spooky one
 fvla: get SPOOKED
 fvla: but yeah, your walls and/or curtains must have been large enough to cast a spooky shadow on you
 KalamariKing: What happens if you print "wait" and then "wait" again
 KalamariKing: does the second "wait" count for the next day
 Tiramon: you skip 2 days
 KalamariKing: oh ok
 fvla: not quite
 ddreams: when you wait you don't get any input or chance of output until the next day
 fvla: your code will desync with input
 fvla: undefined behavior
 Tiramon: well ok 2 outputs without reading in between will give you a 'you didn't read input' warning
 ddreams: from your bot's perspective, after wait it's instantly the next day
 actualCoderTrevor: I thought the next day only happens  when both players wait. You could potentially go again if the other player didn't wait I think. Not sure why you'd want that though.
 ddreams: no, you can't
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh okay
 ddreams: when you wait, you sleep
 Tiramon: yes but if you wait and the opp didn't your bot will not recognize it 
 KalamariKing: so if you wait twice in a day, you'll skip the next day too
 Tiramon: in theory you could use the time between your wait and until the input (so opp waited) to calc some stuff ...
 Tiramon: but that is risky because you don't know when he is done waiting&#160;;)
 Tiramon: you can't wait twice in a day .. only with double output that will give you an error
 ZarthaxX: Tiramon i think your process is put into sleep
 ddreams: I guess technically you could poll the input buffer
 ZarthaxX: so you cant do those things
 Tiramon: my what?
 Tiramon: oh after the wait ... maybe .. not sure
 cegprakash: i tried to understand this function in the referee but unable to understand it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/2785b58e5eb136fdc5349825c33454fa7838270b/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L170">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/2785b58e5eb136fdc5349825c33454fa7838270b/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L170</a> 
 cegprakash: STARTING_TREE_DISTANCE is 2
 cegprakash: not sure what it means
 ZarthaxX: Tiramon i think this has been mentioned in the chat and is a thing sadly :P
 Tiramon: cegprakash guess it chooses the location of the start trees
 Nagatwin: Tiramon thought the proccesses were halted in-between inputs
 cegprakash: Nagatwin but what does the distance mean
 KalamariKing: Does it have something to do with the starting distance a tree can 'throw' a seed
 KalamariKing: or is that different, idk I'm not there yet
 Tiramon: why is the init code important?
 ddreams: it's about how close the trees can be initially
 martinpapa69: maybe your first two trees cannot be closer than STARTING_TREE_DISTANCE  ?
 cegprakash: does it mean they can never be closer than distance 2?
 martinpapa69: im just guessing tho
 jacek: well you dont want shadow at turn 1
 KalamariKing: what
 KelvinAndHubbles: is there a capped amount of submissions per day?
 cegprakash: jacek makes sense
 KalamariKing: what's 'dead code' in javait just means its unreachable right? the code throwing it is inside a if(false)
 martinpapa69: there is a soft cap. if you submit too much, youll be blocked from submitting for few minutes
 martinpapa69: and youll get qannoying captchas
 Tiramon: if (false) can never be true
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 Tiramon: so code can never be reached
 KalamariKing: I need the placehodler
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh they use xyz to differentiate the hex directions. That's clever; I might use that&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: So that's all it means? That its unreachable, nothing else sinister?
 Tiramon: make if (0==1 ) he doesn't recognize it&#160;;)
 KalamariKing: that worked thanks
 cegprakash: @actualCoderTrevor like a cube?
 actualCoderTrevor: Yeah like a cube but not a cube <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/2785b58e5eb136fdc5349825c33454fa7838270b/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/2785b58e5eb136fdc5349825c33454fa7838270b/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java</a>
 fvla: "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."Any advice on diagnosing this?
 Tiramon: 2 outputs without readin inputs ...
 ZarthaxX: restart code and check how input is read :P
 ddreams: are you using starter AI?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Tiramon: oh or starter ai and not all input read&#160;;)
 v1993: nope
 fvla: I have a simple if/else C++ bot in bronze
 jacek: c++ starter?
 geio: yes
 ddreams: you may output twice in a round, or not read all input, or fail to send an endline
 ZarthaxX: is server dying?
 fvla: I've already checked all that, but the problem isn't obvious
 actualCoderTrevor: Comment out different branches until it goes away. That's always worked for me.
 fvla: And my program seems to work correctly to the end vs Default AI
 ddreams: then copy the parameters of the game it's breaking in to the IDE
 fvla: What do you mean/how do I do that?
 ddreams: in last battles, under the TV, there's a big blue button
 v1993: There's Send to IDE button
 fvla: I've gotta submit again, I fixed a real issue regarding input (2 outputs on last round from 1 read)
 v1993: Can you act on your opponent's trees?
 actualCoderTrevor: You can cast a shadow on them
 actualCoderTrevor: Otherwise I don't think so
 v1993: Can I grow/complete them for whatever reason I may want to do that?
 v1993: I'd guess not, but wanna be sure.
 actualCoderTrevor: :thinking:
 Scarfield: can only grow trees you own
 UndercoverToad: now I created a smurf, chat is much faster&#160;:)
 Scarfield: xD nice avatar
 AntiSquid: now i can kick&#160;!
 UndercoverToad: don't you dare
 AntiSquid: ok that's a ban then
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 UndercoverToad: calm down satan
 UndercoverToad: the contest doesn't even show on my start page
 Zenoscave: Welp I dropped
 RDty: I'm rank 1 of wood 1 right now, how do i promote to bronze?
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave python n1
 UndercoverToad: got you Zenoscave
 fvla: RDTY patience
 Zenoscave: T.T
 RDty: gotcha
 fvla: I discovered my issue!
 Zenoscave: Sim yet euler?
 UndercoverToad: stupid monte carlo
 Zenoscave: Gotcha
 UndercoverToad: i won't waste time with heuristics that I don't want to use in the end
 fvla: Basically on last day, I kept on waiting and reading in a loop rather than terminating
 UndercoverToad: MC is nice to test if the sim works
 Zenoscave: Well I doubt I'll have time today to do anything. Work calls...
 Tiramon: yay my sun generation and spooky shadow sim works&#160;;)
 jc725: has anyone been given codingame as a technical assessment?
 phord: They wish.
 phord: I mean, I think Codingame sort of does that. 
 Donald_D._Doge: Hi I am new and I am here for context
 jacek: hello am here for context
 Zenoscave: I'm dad
 Tiramon: guess we all know he means contest&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: gz Tiramon :O
 Zenoscave: based on the context yes
 Westicles: I am here for the buggy, and not user friendly mess
 Tiramon: exactly
 phord: I'm hungry.
 ddreams: Hi hungry
 ddreams: I'm Dad
 Zenoscave: Donald_D._Doge are you going to use DLang?
 Donald_D._Doge: wow, how did you guess?
 Zenoscave: can't tell if sarcasm.
 Donald_D._Doge: fake surprise
 Zenoscave: It's real surprise here since no one uses it since all of your foundation complained to get it added and ditched the site
 Donald_D._Doge: i mean i was faking my surprise
 Zenoscave: And I wasn't
 Donald_D._Doge: ya i think i should have done contest in D, don't really like it
 Zenoscave: You would be the 7th to chose D. out of ~3500
 Zenoscave: Maybe you could even break to the top 1000
 Donald_D._Doge: no alts allowed
 Smelty: guys for "possibleAction" does it include platning seeds farther than 1 grid from the parent
 Westicles: hah, now you see what it is like for all those poor newcomers
 ddreams: yes, you need a size N tree to plant N away from the tree though
 Smelty: oh..!
 Smelty: didn't know that lol
 Zenoscave: Westicles was that you&#160;;)
 Donald_D._Doge: no that's me
 StyllyMyle: Hey i cant find make_tuple in compiler
 StyllyMyle: c++
 Donald_D._Doge: what do you mean Westicles&#160;? new comers can't spam alts&#160;?
 Zenoscave: I'm not pissed at newcomers I'm pissed at the D Language Foundation
 ddreams: what do you mean by "they abandoned the site"?
 phord: #include &lt;tuple&gt;?
 Smelty: resubmitted my now-working code after completely redoing it....hoping for best
 Zenoscave: ddreams they spammed a vote to add D to the site, and then never really used it here after the initial contest
 Smelty:&#160;;-;
 StyllyMyle: phord man ty so much
 ddreams: just as many D users today as OCaml/Lua etc though
 Smelty: interestin
 SuperStreet7: How do you go from one league to the other?
 Zenoscave: fair. but we had a choice to get a different language and the vote was given to D
 Smelty: you get...promoted
 Smelty: superstreet7
 v1993: You beat the boss to do that
 ddreams: which other language?
 Smelty: you have to have a higher elo than the boss
 SuperStreet7: Ah right, thank you
 Zenoscave: SuperStreet7 score higher than the boss and wait for the matches to complete
 v1993: Make sure to select "test in arena"
 Smelty: which is compiled from win/loss ratio
 Donald_D._Doge: Zenoscave i agree they should have stuck around more
 Zenoscave: ddreams let find the list. Sorry if that was harsh earlier. DLang just hits a nerve
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My trees are made of hemp, the spirit keeps cutting them down, smoking them, and taking a nap
 jacek: yeah, contest should start at 20th april
 Donald_D._Doge: well next in line was TypeScript and we have that now so ...
 Zenoscave: lol jacek
 Smelty: lol, my bday is 19th april
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 420 ... tc jacek, had to use my brain lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tc=tx
 Smelty: patrick :rofl:
 phord: I never sleep if there are more actions available.  That seems like a bad strategy.
 Smelty: oh...!! struct got kicked out of top 3
 StyllyMyle: Why?
 Smelty: phord sometimes you have to save up energy to complete a tree
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like Illedan figured out how to ramp up sun production
 phord: Exactly
 Donald_D._Doge: would you use Julia if it was added&#160;? most languages aren't used Zenoscave
 ZarthaxX: smalltalk
 phord: I mean, my "never sleeping" seems like a bad strategy.
 StyllyMyle: Finally
 StyllyMyle: made pr to add these two annoying commands&#160;:(
 jacek: pr?
 AntiSquid: public relations
 StyllyMyle: Pull request
 StyllyMyle: LOOOL
 Westicles: Ah squid, you missed out.  We know you love talking about the D
 Nerchio: struct 8th :O
 AntiSquid: that wording ...
 ddreams: accidental, I'm sure
 struct: Nerchio my bot didnt even made it to 24 hours&#160;:(
 Tiramon: phord if you have no actions left you sleep automatically
 ddreams: you still have to output wait
 Tiramon: if you output something else it sleeps anyway because it will be an invalid action
 khirshah: hi all&#160;:) is there a timetable of some sort of the live streams somewhere?
 jacek: hm?
 Westicles: streamers are barely coordinated enough to keep a steady supply of cheetos around
 khirshah: last fall we got info on who is going to livestream their coding and when, which language, etc, I can't seem to find that info now
 elijah.toppo: Any ideas of finding all spooky cells?
 Maliamnon: elijah.toppo - i'm using linked lists of neighbor cells
 elijah.toppo: Great idea. Thanks.
 elderlybeginner: where is an info, which constest leagues starts when?
 Tiramon: ok state should by usable, sim should be working .. .now i 'just' need a algo to use all this ...
 phord: Spooky shadows are spooky even if they come from your own tree, right?  The examples show opposing-color trees.
 ddreams: yes
 Tiramon: yes phord
 elijah.toppo: yes
 Tiramon: trees are no racists .. color doesn't matter
 phord: I heard they're colorblind, anyway.
 Tiramon: maybe thats the reason&#160;;)
 v1993: Maybe make wooden2 boss a bit less dumb? It seems way to easy to beat even with simplest algorithm.
 jacek: wood is just tutorial
 Tiramon: thats what a wood boss is for
 KalamariKing: yk the bug where chat will slowly scroll down with no way to take manual control
 KalamariKing: if you collapse and reopen its at the bottom
 v1993: Wait, I meant wood 1 boss, sorry. In wood 2 the entire algo is very simple, wood 1 allows more freedom but very easy boss.
 Tiramon: wood = tutorial ... so if you want' more evil bosses join us in bronze ...
 ddreams: the point is to teach the rules, not to provide a challenge
 Tiramon: still without boss, but it will be more evil&#160;;)
 v1993: Also oh boy, battles are really slow rn, on my way to bronze ofc
 KalamariKing: battles take forever
 KalamariKing: especially as games get longer
 Michael_Howard: Hmm. Guess a score-all-your-moves-and-pick-one strategy aint gonna cut it this time.
 KalamariKing: Are you using a search algo to pick the best
 KalamariKing: Or just picking one of them
 Michael_Howard: I haven't done a tree yet.
 KalamariKing: I think you gotta go a few moves into the future
 KalamariKing: trees suck
 selindoga: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 RoboStac: yeah, if we banned trees from this contest it'd be much easier
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 <b>**selindoga slaps  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/62970586063965" /> selindoga: /me
 StyllyMyle: I totally love this contest
 cegprakash: without trees what's there to seed, grow or complete? RoboStac
 KalamariKing: ┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)  no need for that
 StyllyMyle:&#160;:)
 StyllyMyle: Tress are best
 StyllyMyle: uh btw
 KalamariKing: cegprakash trees as in search trees
 StyllyMyle: How do you basically get the trees and action?
 KalamariKing: wdym
 StyllyMyle: do you maintain array for that or use possible actions?
 cegprakash: I wouldn't be surprised if someone actually uses graphs and reaches legend in this problem
 KalamariKing: Wdym graphs
 KalamariKing: Explain
 StyllyMyle: Same
 StyllyMyle: i wana ask
 StyllyMyle: what is graph
 KalamariKing: Or synonymize
 AllYourWhat: G R A P H
 StyllyMyle: Is that a language?
 jacek: tree is graph eh
 biz1: why do I always get Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 StyllyMyle: biz1 are you using cpp?
 StyllyMyle: starter code
 StyllyMyle: or theres some problem with your data parsing/ cout
 StyllyMyle: output*
 biz1: pretty much using python starter rn
 cegprakash: StyllyMyle graphs are like roads and houses in the road.. roads connect path to the houses in the city.. Similarly in this problem u have roads where u can travel and move to tree locations.
 phord: When my cpp aborts, there's no indications.  Game over.  Any common way to get a stacktrace or something?
 StyllyMyle: OHH
 cegprakash: StyllyMyle search for graph datastructure in wikipedia
 v1993: phrod what does "Console output" tab say?
 StyllyMyle: Ok! Thanks for some extra knowledge, i m gonna read that thing
 cegprakash: @StyllyMyle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory</a>
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 v1993: "Jumping from tree to tree salesman problem"
 phord: Nothing except what I printed to cerr.
 phord: It's not crashing now.  Yesterday it did for a bit.  I just had to diagnose it with printf-debugging.
 phord: Too lazy to build locally.
 Tiramon: then how do you know it aborts?maybe you added a return or break  in the wrong spot?
 phord: It was def. aborting.  Printed the first line in my loop, but nothing else.  I forget why, now, but I found what I was doing wrong.  
 alskdjfhgbhuvfr: fuck u
 JP7: No, u?
 struct: saved
 StyllyMyle: a sapling, a seed is also counted as tree r8?
 ddreams: yep
 StyllyMyle: Tenks!
 v1993: Yup, it's mentioned in rules
 ddreams: Welkms
 Tiramon: StyllyMyle it's a tree of size 0
 jacek: it should use the Happy Tree Friends theme
 AntiSquid: :o
 ddreams:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: look it up
 jacek: you never watched it?
 ddreams: nope
 jacek: kids these days...
 AntiSquid: ya i was a teen and they were streaming it during day time lol
 Counterbalance: i have the original flash files somewhere...
 v1993: Is it possible to have less dumb bronze AI, please? I can hardly fine-tune my settings when even the easiest setup beats it.
 v1993: And contending in arena takes forever.
 RoboStac: you can delete that ai and replace it with any other player
 ddreams: you can choose my bot :p
 ddreams: it's pretty dumb
 StyllyMyle: Hey so i have a question
 ddreams: click Delete under the default AI icon
 StyllyMyle: I somehow made program which im confident will pass bronze league
 Over9000: you can also compete against your own old code
 v1993: Ohh, thanks for the tip! Didn't knew this.
 StyllyMyle: It is not that complex, and tbh is random and prioritize some actions before another, I could still perfect it or just jump league
 StyllyMyle: what should i opt for?
 ddreams: I don't understand the question
 StyllyMyle: I totally beat this ai boss by double of its point
 StyllyMyle: i think time to go?
 ddreams: the default ai is not the bronze league boss
 StyllyMyle: What?
 StyllyMyle: Im testing in arena, screw it&#160;:)
 ddreams: you probably have to beat one of the people who are the top players now
 StyllyMyle: Dont we need to just outrank bot?
 v1993: Nope, one of stronger bots will be used as a boss
 StyllyMyle: Ah i see
 StyllyMyle: wait does it take time to test in arena?
 v1993: So yeah, but boss will be different from current default AI
 StyllyMyle: will my code be compiled against all those present there?
 ddreams: you can just test in the arena, doesn't cost you any time
 ddreams: and it saves your code in case you mess it up later
 v1993: It will run in background
 StyllyMyle: Its taking kinda time to jump up the ranks
 ddreams: so?
 StyllyMyle: cant i see it quickly? :D
 v1993: Servers are busy running all those bots, be patient&#160;:)
 elderlybeginner: when silver opens?
 StyllyMyle: Okk
 ddreams: click the Bronze League on top and it will show you
 elderlybeginner: @ddreams&#160;: thanks
 v1993: By the way, is this contest based on some other media or is it its own thing?
 ddreams: there's a boardgame 
 Wontonimo: what's the name
 ddreams: photosynthesis?
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218603/photosynthesis">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218603/photosynthesis</a>
 geio: how can i get input without printing all the stuff
 v1993: Cool, thanks!
 Noyotens: hi guys
 geio: o/
 Wontonimo: thanks RoboStac&#160;!
 TobiasA: it took me a whole day just get the spots a tree can plant a seed and now i have forgotten why i even wanted to do that
 TobiasA: i couldn't get any dumber than this
 ddreams: if you want to generate your possible actions, you need to know that
 TobiasA: yes yes yes yes
 TobiasA: you were sent from heaven
 v1993: My favorite part of previous contest was how my bot lost to low-ranked ones but performed much better in middle segment.
 TheScreamingMonk: hello all i am new here and i am having trouble with coders strike back, i can figure out the angles i need to be useing can someone help me&#160;?
 WesCraterMadman: the best swordsman in the world fears the complete beginner more than the second best swordsman, because the beginner can't be predicted
 ddreams: lol, yeah, that's so untrue though
 WesCraterMadman: not really. At least in swordfighting, it's really easy to kill someone if you don't care that you die too
 cegprakash: guys I searched in problem statement already but I can't find anywhere where it say we can only control the trees/seeds that we own. Can we control opponent trees/seeds?
 ddreams: try it, report back
 Scarfield: xD
 v1993: I think not
 ddreams: have you ever done any swordfighting, like fencing or something?
 WesCraterMadman: a little bit
 WesCraterMadman: but I was more responding to v1993
 Smelty: my ai sucks&#160;:(
 v1993: Yeah, I got it was directed at me
 v1993: I'm still not sure how that happened given how simple my bot was
 Zenoscave: has there been a brutaltester compatible ref yet?
 Zanoshky: is silver league open?
 Over9000: it says 10th of march
 WesCraterMadman: says it opens the 10th
 WesCraterMadman: ^
 Zanoshky: if you are under 300 , will you be promoted to next league?
 Smelty: idk
 ddreams: unlikely
 Smelty: i used to be top 100, but now im 500&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: depends on where they set the league cutoff
 struct: I hope I make it
 Zenoscave: I dropped about 50 ranks too
 WesCraterMadman: is there a bronze boss ai yet?
 Smelty: nope
 Zenoscave: struct sshhhhh
 xdcomrade: when will the silver league open?
 Over9000: I got these weird notifications yesterday: "You have been promoted to Silver league."
 Smelty: 10th of march
 Zenoscave: Over9000 there was a bug 
 jrke: it will drop more if you didn't update your bot
 Smelty: over9000 they accidentally opened silver league
 elijah.toppo: What happens when you don't make the cut-off? are you disqualified or can we keep trying
 Over9000: ah ok
 Zenoscave: they sent people to silver and reverted
 Smelty: you have to keep going until you can beat the boss in promotion..
 Zenoscave: elijah.toppo you can keep trying it just is a little harder
 elijah.toppo: OK
 Zenoscave: the sooner you enter a  league the easier it is
 elijah.toppo: Hmm.. got it.. 
 elijah.toppo: My ai sucks too.. :D
 WesCraterMadman: haha yeah. I started around 100 and I'm sitting around 500 now
 Zenoscave: submitting right before a league open is always a bad idea though
 ddreams: I don't think that makes sense
 Zenoscave: ddreams
 Zenoscave: the boss gets pushed up and inflated after opening
 Zenoscave: even if you can beat it alone, others are strong too
 elijah.toppo: Does the boss have a rank as well? How to check that if so?
 ddreams: If you say so
 Zenoscave: He's on the leaderboard once the boss is chosen
 olaf_surgut: is it common that first battle gives timeout?
 ddreams: not unless you don't write a command or a newline
 Smelty: hmm....
 Smelty: which strat is better overall, keeping trees to harvest at end or harvesting as you go
 UndercoverToad: somewhere in between
 ddreams: The top players harvest around day 12 or so
 elijah.toppo: Hmm.. I was harvesting all in the end.
 elijah.toppo: Will try playing with that now
 Smelty: hmm....ineresting
 Smelty: a version of my bot that harvests on the go consistently beats a harvest at end version of my bot
 Smelty:&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: nutrient scores matter
 Zanoshky: I am kind of new to the .... advance algorithms
 Smelty: if you are looking for any type of simulation, i can't help you lolMy bot is if/else
 UndercoverToad: you solved last crusade episode 3, you clearly know some advanced path finding algos
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: caught
 Smelty: i prefer to use if/else though
 Astrobytes: 'UndercoverToad'
 UndercoverToad: chat was too laggy
 UndercoverToad: i'm sure you still know who I am
 Astrobytes: Considering similar myself
 Smelty: lag chat, again?
 UndercoverToad: for moderators it's horror
 ddreams: what's the difference?
 Astrobytes: No, for moderators there are so many people in chat it lags during contests
 UndercoverToad: when you are fast at typing, you can see 2 letters per second appear
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/BmQQwpa">https://imgur.com/a/BmQQwpa</a>
 Smelty: yea, happens
 UndercoverToad: find the scrollbar
 Smelty: sometimes i start typing too soon and then the first half of my message doesnt show up
 UndercoverToad: the lag is proportional to the number of users it seems
 RoboStac: moderators get to see the full online user list, it gets cut down for normal users
 ddreams: could you perhaps just delete the member html?
 UndercoverToad: haven't tried but i fear it will just update again
 UndercoverToad: and the new account was a matter of minutes in a one-time action
 Smelty: lolol
 Smelty: mAn my code sux
 UndercoverToad: and now i can say "hi i'm new" and ask for help
 RoboStac: have you updated thors position?
 UndercoverToad: i'm sure the puzzle has a bug
 Astrobytes: Did you remember your newline?
 cegprakash: focus ceg focus
 Smelty: sighs
 Smelty: I Swear I improve my code and get kicked down a couple hundred places
 cricri10000: Ah much easier to chat here
 miszu: do your unit tests
 Theino: Does anyone know if you can use Microsoft.ML on here?
 miszu: you will save time debugging
 WesCraterMadman: I think it resets you every time you resubmit, smelty
 Theino: I'm in C#.NET and "using Microsoft.ML;" gives "are you missing an assembly reference"... I was wondering if there's a fancy way to get the site to use the package
 Smelty: wes ik
 Smelty: but it just peaks at 500 now
 Smelty: used to be in 100 and 200
 Smelty: xD
 WesCraterMadman: lol me too. I just assumed it's because all the good bots are hanging out in bronze
 Smelty: yea
 Uljahn: Theino: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>

 GuillaumeBardy: verry good game&#160;:) 15 actually without an huge algorithm 
 Smelty: w-
 Smelty: wow.
 Smelty: currently have a winstreak from 2-23
 Smelty: (lost first battle lol)
 UndercoverToad: first is against top10% of the league
 Smelty: yea
 Smelty: and then u get sent down to 3000 and fight against noob bots, getting a lot of wins
 Jason_Down: Is there a way to see any of your battles from the previous league as well as the rules? I forgot to grab them for a blog post for my coworkers.
 Smelty: currently i start losing in the 20s
 Smelty: nope...
 Smelty: you can create an alt and go thru them though
 AstroHydes: Hii. Send help. I am new.
 Smelty: not sure if illegal
 Smelty: lol astro
 Uljahn: astrobruh
 Zenoscave: something tells me your father is a penguin Astrobytes
 Smelty: "Astro alt account for testing things"
 Zenoscave: it wouldn't even auto complete right
 Smelty: hmms
 Jason_Down: I guess that's one option. Option 2 is wait for the contest to end and do it when it becomes a multiplayer game.
 Zenoscave: that detirmins it
 Smelty: true
 AstroHydes: Yep. And contest chat. I should add  that
 Smelty: although you can ask other people for footage
 Smelty: ALSO remember to save bronze for later
 Zenoscave: bronze is final rules
 Smelty: still
 Smelty: later matches have more games
 Smelty: *days
 Smelty: possibly
 Zenoscave: nope
 Smelty: oook
 SirLoxley: when does silver open?
 Smelty: 10th of marc
 Smelty: *may
 UndercoverToad: wood rules: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8824954ce73a2d6ac78458c945ac20f0303ef8">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8824954ce73a2d6ac78458c945ac20f0303ef8</a>
 Smelty: dang so many ppl be askin this
 Zenoscave: unless I missed something silver will be exactly the same
 UndercoverToad: Jason_Down
 UndercoverToad: switch leagues at the top right
 AstroHydes: But it opened yesterday... :P
 WesCraterMadman: no new rules going forward, afaik
 Smelty: oo oo o oo
 Jason_Down: Thanks UndercoverToad
 Smelty: i have decided to make my character spew nonsense
 AstroHydes: Same. The nonsense mine spews is called an action
 Counterbalance: any rickroll bots yet?
 dbdr: how does that look like Counterbalance?
 Scarfield: saying the lyrics turn for turn
 WesCraterMadman: now I kinda wanna do that
 WesCraterMadman: it might give me the psychological edge
 SirLoxley: it's sad the spirits can't hurl gnawing insults at each other. I liked that a lot during the last contest
 fvla: But they're robots, Morty!
 Smelty: rickroll bots xDDDDD
 Smelty: what if i do that
 ddreams: then you'll rickroll yourself while writing it
 Smelty: yep
 casmith789: you can still give messages
 WesCraterMadman: jokes on you I love that song
 ddreams: top bot keeps telling me it think it's losing
 Smelty: yep
 ddreams: but it's not
 Smelty: xD same
 yonder83: how to model this for search algo
 Smelty: is there a puase between verse 1 and pre-chorus
 yonder83: everything is easy without the sun
 Smelty: xD
 dbdr: silver will introduce sun eclipses
 Scarfield: interesting the shadows always have the same legnth, flat earth confirmed
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: or its too small an area
 yonder83: can I ignore sun
 ddreams: yes
 ddreams: you won't reach legend though
 Smelty: ok finished righting rickroll

 AstroHydes: Flatfield
 Scarfield: xD
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: Astrofield
 Scarfield: nice nick!
 LePrat: anyone else got to bronze league directly after wood 2&#160;? u_u
 Smelty: uh...no-
 Scarfield: yup, even got silver
 Smelty: i spent 30 mins in wood1
 Smelty: xDDDD
 Smelty: and then ja got demoted
 LePrat: i don't know if i'm really in bronze tho
 AstroHydes: Had to do something  about the chat lag Scarfield, figured I better change my alt acc nick to something people might get :P
 Smelty: I literally spent 50 lines of code writing rickroll...what am i doing with my life
 Counterbalance: :D
 dbdr: cricri10000
 WesCraterMadman: great things
 AstroHydes: Yes dbdr
 LePrat: can somebody know what is added in bronze&#160;?
 LePrat: does*
 Scarfield: yea its apparently very laggy for mods. but CG is going to remove you as mods since you are breaking the rules :p
 WesCraterMadman: trees have shadows and you can throw trees
 AstroHydes: Nonsense Scarfield.
 WesCraterMadman: if a tree is in the shadow of a bigger tree, it doesn't collect sun points
 dbdr: your popup says AstroHydes
 LePrat: ok i'm indeed in bronze without doing wood 1
 Zenoscave: I made a brutaltester
 LePrat: wtf
 struct: nice Zenoscave
 AstroHydes: dbdr: I changed it so it was recognisable 
 AstroHydes: Using this one for chat only
 struct: Did you use official referee zeno?
 Zenoscave: yup
 AstroHydes: dbdr: Astrobytes has his ?disableChat on
 Zenoscave: with a modified magus cli
 Dr-D: I got promoted to bronce as well with my wood2 Ai @ LePrat
 struct: I hope the refree I made works
 struct: At least I used it for a while
 Rag: I am very lost with seed placement, I guess always aiming for the top soil is not worth it =/
 Zenoscave: I can send you my fork once I push
 AstroHydes: I want your spoon tho
 Zenoscave: I'll spoon you
 Dr-D: Guess we got lucky to get pushed beyond the boss with those ties 
 struct: sure
 Zenoscave: ...r eyes out
 <b>**AstroHydes runs away</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: I can also check if mines faster by any big margin
 struct: if it is ill sed you mine
 Zenoscave: sure thing
 AstroHydes: sed eh
 NinjaDoggy: struct why does your sim bot lose to python bots :rage:
 struct: chat so laggy I cant fix typos
 struct: NinjaDoggy because I only tested vs myself
 AstroHydes: Who were the other testers other than T zupy?
 Rag: how do I go about testing locally? I would need the game source code right?
 AstroHydes: Yes, it's on the linked github repo Rag
 struct: Konstan t and jmpe g
 struct: some cg staff was also on the leaderboard
 AstroHydes: cool
 miszu: struct, I see you changed your profile pic
 Thiesjoo: Does a dormant tree not cast a shadow?
 JeanpierCalderonPuente: im new on this
 Scarfield: all trees casts shadows
 jacek: Thiesjoo it does
 SirLoxley: Can I select a specific player/bot to my IDE as opponent?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: just click delete under the avatar
 Thiesjoo: Ahhh but if i grow the tree in that turn, it doesn't count for the shadows on a current turn
 MSmits: you get sunpoints at the start, so nope
 Thiesjoo: Hmmmm
 SirLoxley: thanks
 MSmits: even if it did count for shade, sunpoints are already handed out
 AstroHydes: Oh Thiesjoo is competing too MSmits, nice. Any others?
 MSmits: you mean from my school? Not that I know
 Thiesjoo: Ohhh wait shadows are only calculated at the start of a day
 MSmits: yeah i think so
 MSmits: you can look  at the referee too, it's java
 AstroHydes: Ah. You should bribe them next time.
 Thiesjoo: Yeah i looked into the referree
 MSmits: it was actually a surprise to me that Thiesjoo joined. He didn't tell me he would (and he doesnt have to)
 Thiesjoo: But it didn;t work with my local program
 Thiesjoo: MSmits yeah i always find these contests fun, so i joined
 MSmits: its cool
 Thiesjoo: But it's right before my exams
 AstroHydes: That's cool MSmits and Thiesjoo
 MSmits: yeah thats one of the reasons i am surprised
 AstroHydes: Exams are WAY mroe important Thiesjoo
 AstroHydes: *more
 Thiesjoo: Hmmmm
 AstroHydes: But you can spend downtime on this&#160;;)
 MSmits: I am not worried about Thiesjoo passing them, but higher grades could be nice
 AstroHydes: Yes. Always aim high.
 Scarfield: wait, growing a tree doesnt change its shadow until next day, weird
 Thiesjoo: Yes scarfield. Its pretty weird
 Thiesjoo: I will pass just fine, and my study is not selective. So high grades do not really matter
 Scarfield: i just assumed it did, thanks for saving me the time finding that bug&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's confusing when you look at replays 
 MSmits: because a day is kind of a turn yet it's not a turn
 dbdr: and it
 AstroHydes: Just don't compare the game with reality and you'll be fine.
 Maliamnon: you don't get sun points until the next day, so it's fine
 dbdr: 's called a round too :D
 Scarfield: does a tree cast a shadow if you are not there to see?
 fvla: would be nice if days had an indicator on the timeline, like completions do
 MSmits: Maliamnon yes, it works fine, but it can lead to problems when you are testing your sim or something
 kovi: msmits, yes. i debug say the days...
 fvla: otherwise, I'm not confused by days vs turns
 AstroHydes: Scarfield, of course.
 MSmits: me neither, but replays have always been problematic when testing things, they often have off by 1 errors when comparing frames with the debug output
 fvla: that can be confusing
 MSmits: so you're looking at the frame with the debug output from previous turn, that sort of thing
 Francis69: julle almal se poese stink
 MSmits: if your cat stinks, just bathe it
 MSmits: cant believe I am giving pet grooming advice here
 fvla: you could just not give any advice at all
 MSmits: true
 vagos: yea dummie
 fvla: i've wasted too much time in the past giving advice
 MSmits: it's different here
 MSmits: i often get information back
 fvla: true
 MSmits: just dont share things during contests that you dont think anyone else has thought of
 Astrobytes: Unless you're euler
 gd1035: Anyone use Groovy here? With the autogenerated code it keeps timing out
 cegprakash: is it safe to keep the trees inside player class or better to keep it outside?
 MSmits: anyone else check if Groovy was in the list of languages?
 fvla: me
 MSmits: kinda cool
 MSmits: or... groovy
 Thiesjoo: Noice i got the shadow simulation working!
 MSmits: gd1035 the autogenerated code is probably ok
 dbdr: if you did more golfing you would know&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: No Groovy is there. I did some golfing in it? Or maybe just language achievement. That's all I know.
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: Thiesjoo gj 
 gd1035: I would think that it should be ok
 gd1035: but it keeps failing and timing out
 Astrobytes: All I know is I was listening to Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and had my flares on
 gd1035: without modifying it
 fvla: perl -pe '/C(\+\+)/ or die "You're using the wrong language lol"'
 fvla: oh, forgot a question mark
 Astrobytes: Someone ping my AstroHydes nick if any spammers/trolls appear please
 fvla: What languages do you use/recommend for code golf?
 AstroHydes: Java
 fvla: I occasionally dipped my toes into code golf and used exclusively perl
 fvla: ...
 AstroHydes: :grin:
 fvla: lol
 AstroHydes: perl yeah, ruby, python
 SirLoxley: Anyone else finding it odd that the sun rises in the east and sets ... in the east?
 vagos: no
 vagos: just you
 jacek: ask Celestia
 AstroHydes: Sounds like a new Jeru the Damaja album SirLoxley
 fvla: precession of the earth do be weird like that
 Smelty: lolxi
 BlaiseEbuth: Someone ping my AstroHydes nick if any spammers/trolls appear please...You're the worst troll here.
 AstroHydes: I wasn't earlier BlaiseEbuth, and now you're here I am not any more.
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: :flushed:
 Smelty: o . zo
 fvla: tfw saying a correct statement makes it wrong
 AstroHydes: Troll-in-Chief! jacek, respect his authoritahh
 SirLoxley: Ok, something more serious, though, a tree in shade ... does it cast a shade?
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: or mp
 Smelty: *no
 fvla: yes
 AstroHydes: I believe it does yes
 fvla: "Each tree casts a shadow" means each tree casts a shadow.
 fvla: no but really, it wouldn't make sense otherwise
 fvla: shadowed objects irl DO, in fact, cast shadows too
 AntiSquid: plant Jack's bean stalk for 100 suns
 AntiSquid: beanstalk *
 fvla: lmao

 MSmits: dont bait the AntiSquid
 MSmits: it's dangerous
 MSmits: I bet he's now stocking up on replays where you lose&#160;:)
 jacek: it would be easy eh
 struct: MSmits have you finished bs?
 ZarthaxX: whats up with bullshit
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: well I was no longer bs-ing, but if you want, i can do some more bs
 MSmits: but no, my beamsearch is not yet done
 MSmits: i am going to try just finishing the day first, like euler mentioned
 MSmits: see if that works
 struct: using beam to finish the day?
 MSmits: bs is a bit more complicated in this game because of turns vs days
 MSmits: yeah just eval the next few turns till the day ends
 MSmits: so depth 2-3 probably
 MSmits: to get the bugs out for that
 MSmits: then add more days
 AntiSquid: smelty&#160;? why ping @_@
 struct: I just add the finished to the queue 
 struct: Might not be the best way though
 MSmits: hmm, the queue?
 MSmits: dont you need to beam them?
 struct: yes
 struct: I beam them anyways
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: all mixed up
 AntiSquid: i don't get what's special about that reply lol @smelty
 MSmits: i just generate wait children and if a state is already a wait state i duplicate it
 AllYourWhat: B E A M S E A R C H
 struct: I can be beaming turn 19 and 23 at the same time as far as I know
 struct: yeah its similar to what I do
 MSmits: i have 2 arrays i swap back and forth between children and parents
 MSmits: so wait parents get copied to the other array
 struct: ah
 AllYourWhat: you guys used beam search for the last comp too right?
 struct: I see
 MSmits: i didnt participate in it, but i sure would have done that yes
 struct: I did
 Smelty: hmm
 kovi: all your trees
 MSmits: are mine?
 Counterbalance: all your trees are belong to us
 MSmits: kovi blacked out halfway through his evil villain speach
 Smelty: *our tree
 MSmits: speech
 AllYourWhat: true i should change my name to that
 MSmits: Counterbalance i thought that :P
 AllYourTrees: OKAY IM READY
 MSmits: wasnt sure if that reference was international
 AllYourTrees: jk NOW IM READY
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance&#160;!!&#160;:*
 kovi: (it was. i remember halite...)
 Counterbalance: it's japanenglish so I gues so
 AllYourTrees: AllYourTurtles &lt;/3
 Omar_ALearningProgrammer: ok then
 Wontonimo: all witness the mighty if/else bots!  wow, i really didn't think not having a simulation would get this high
 ZarthaxX: python n1 :D
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo it just started anyway
 ZarthaxX: they may drop by the end
 AstroHydes: AllYourForest, AllYourSeeds, AllYourTrees etc
 Omar_ALearningProgrammer: :neutral_face:
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 ZarthaxX: AstroHydes too many ppl for a mod=? :P
 Wontonimo: ZarthaxX yeah, i hear that.  Silver hasn't even opened yet.
 AstroHydes: ZarthaxX: Yeah man, was getting really laggy
 AstroHydes: So I renamed my testing account
 AllYourTrees: to what?
 ZarthaxX: like toad :P
 Donald_D._Doge: i hope these alts get banned or something, they're out of control
 ZarthaxX:&#160;?
 AstroHydes: AllYourWhat: To this!
 Smelty: xDDDDD
 AstroHydes: Donald_D_Doge: That's GOT to be a Westicles thing or someone is ripping the piss
 icecream17: 50ish to 261 in a few hours&#160;!
 AstroHydes: #winning
 AntiSquid: laptop cat don't you have piano lessons to attend? ascend to a piano cat
 AstroHydes: I Am The Seal of Approval
 Donald_D._Doge: ripping a piss? that would take quite some ingenuity 
 AllYourTrees: can someone add a WaitingBot that just waits every turn
 ZarthaxX: for what
 JBM: y not u
 ZarthaxX: you can submit that :D
 AllYourTrees: oh yeah good idea
 ZarthaxX: YEAH JBM TELL HIM!
 ZarthaxX: lol it worked
 JBM: just did
 AllYourTrees: very convincing JBM
 JBM: :glasses: My Job Here Is Done
 MSmits: You can submit a wait bot and then test vs the wait bot in your IDE
 vagos: no its not
 AntiSquid: ask top 10 they'll do it AllYourWhat
 AstroHydes: Donald_D._Doge: Fix your UK/Irish informal phrase knowledge.
 Marchete: just play against yourself
 Westicles: AstroHydes, that is some inception level depth if you are just pretending not to know him
 Omar_ALearningProgrammer:&#160;:')
 Donald_D._Doge: and stop pinging me on both accounts
 Omar_ALearningProgrammer: :grimacing:
 Omar_ALearningProgrammer: lol
 AstroHydes: Always a laugh a minute in here.
 AntiSquid: that's just another spam emotes person
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548423162">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548423162</a>
 Smelty: hi icecream how u doing
 icecream17: im good
 AstroHydes: Melting currently.
 icecream17: well i just came back to 281st
 AstroHydes: gj
 icecream17: but that isn't too bad
 Smelty: o.o
 icecream17: i was ~50th ~1am today
 Smelty: imma fightyo
 icecream17: now its 3:36pm here
 MSmits: quick c++ question. I know how to do nth element, but is there an easy function to get the maximum item out of an array according to a property of that item?
 AntiSquid: icecream17 take leaderboard screenshot while you're above m smits and post it in your postmortem end of contest 
 Smelty: icecream17 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TIE <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548425098">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548425098</a>
 AntiSquid: or save replay
 icecream17:&#160;!!!!
 icecream17: bookmark!
 Smelty: same points, same treeees
 icecream17: i've never done a postmortem before
 AstroHydes: MSmits, you can sort with a lambda
 MSmits: i dont need to sort
 MSmits: i just want the 1 maximum item
 Smelty: hm
 RoboStac: max takes a comparison function too
 deoignition: ok bro
 DomiKo: you can do max_element with lambda
 AntiSquid: sort()[0]
 deoignition: sure it does
 AstroHydes: well select whatever with a lambda
 MSmits: ah ok, thanks RoboStac and DomiKo
 AstroHydes: [](){}
 MSmits: and astrosmurf
 AstroHydes: sorry I misread your max_element bit
 MSmits: np, it's a weird question, you'd expect i know this
 AstroHydes: you do now
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: i generally always write a whole loop for this sht
 MSmits: which is why my code is always too many lines
 AllYourTrees: click the language dropdown, select python3, convert all your c++ to python, add max(items, key=lambda i: i.property), search for a python -&gt; c++ transpiler online, transpile your python code to c++, copy new c++ code to ide
 KnightMoves: Going straight for C++ this time, huh?
 MSmits: I usually do, these last few contests
 AntiSquid: so easy AllYourWhat :O
 MSmits: nice one AllYourWhat&#160;:)
 KnightMoves: I thought you did C# first last time
 TheLuckyMagician: Hello guys are there any simple (easy puzzles that uses DPS algorithm , I want to practice it but i dont want to spend more than an hour trying to figure out the puzzle by itself).
 Wontonimo: excellent AllYourWhat , but what if I'm coding PHP?
 AllYourTrees: :sunglasses:
 KnightMoves: I decided to do the opposite and start in Python instead of C++
 MSmits: hmm, that might be true KnightMoves, thats what i used to do
 TheScreamingMonk: hey can anyone help me with this code?
 AllYourTrees: then just convert your php to c++ first and then continue with my instructions
 MSmits: yeah, pacman i had C# for a day or two i think
 AstroHydes: Wontonimo: then I suggest you get the tacos and kebabs in and don't worry about anything
 Wontonimo: hmm tacos!
 MSmits: this game is so much simpler than pacman though, sim-wise
 AntiSquid: KnightMoves python for quick bronze to get all rules @_@
 Thiesjoo: Even i can get a sim working!
 Wontonimo: wow Thiesjoo 
 Wontonimo: jk
 Smelty: eeee
 MSmits: you solved bender4, it should be easy
 Smelty: well i cant
 TheLuckyMagician: Hello guys are there any simple (easy puzzles that uses DPS algorithm , I want to practice it but i dont want to spend more than an hour trying to figure out the puzzle by itself).
 Wontonimo: i don't have a sim running yet
 Smelty: *i ahvent
 Thiesjoo: A good eval function is next!
 KnightMoves: In that last witches brew contest i started in C++ and over-optimized my code too early, instead of focusing on writing a better algorithm.
 Wontonimo: hey TheLuckyMagician , give i a min to search ...
 AstroHydes: Wontonimo: Thies joo is/was a student of MSmits&#160;;)
 AllYourTrees: optimization is the root of all trees?
 MSmits: well he is until the summer
 AllYourTrees: is that the saying?
 KnightMoves: :D
 Wontonimo: oh, so he knows his true identity!  
 AstroHydes: Evil is the root of all tree optimizations AllYourWhat
 bluehipy: how do you make them say the extra stuff in the preview?
 AntiSquid: yes Wontonimo, but he doesn't say much about his teacher atm
 MSmits: it's not like i am too secretive
 Thiesjoo: :eyes: i know his real identity
 WaitEveryTurn: AstroHydes :scream:
 AntiSquid: Thiesjoo what happened to his other students&#160;?
 MSmits: they didn't make it :P
 AstroHydes: Chat's just too much fun tonight
 Wontonimo: haha AntiSquid&#160;!  :D
 Thiesjoo: They didn't have a big enough brain to understand MSmits (:
 AntiSquid: woah :o
 AllYourTrees: agree AstroHydes
 gwolpi: I'm here thanks to you though Thiesjoo :p
 Wontonimo: hey TheLuckyMagician , i couldn't find anything.  google a simple tutorial in your lang of choice
 gwolpi: even though I am no student
 Jackalabrute: When does the next league come out&#160;?
 Thiesjoo: Gwolpi you better have a silver bot by tommorrow
 Wontonimo: Monday
 gwolpi: No worries. 
 MSmits: oh cool, you're a friend of Thiesjoo gwolpi?
 AstroHydes: Yesterday Jackalabrute
 AstroHydes: :P
 MSmits: need more Dutch on this site
 AstroHydes: Thiesjoo is recruiting too? Awesome!
 gwolpi: Yeah, pretty much MSmits. We know each other through the internet :D
 Westicles: What is DPS?
 gwolpi: But I'm like 10 years older than him
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Wontonimo: Dammage Per Second
 gwolpi: Same interest in programming though
 AntiSquid: d stands for double, figure the rest out yourself Westicles
 MSmits: I see, well have fun here
 MSmits: plenty to do
 gwolpi: Cheers :D
 AstroHydes: MSmits: Geest. That's Dutch for ghost. More Dutch on the site.
 Wontonimo: DoublePercisionSandwiches
 Thiesjoo: Nice!
 AllYourTrees: is discord more active than the chat here?
 AllYourTrees: or what do ppl even talk about on the discord
 AntiSquid: usually not
 AstroHydes: It depends. If the webchat is full of children then usually discord is the best bet, but it's prudent to check both.
 AllYourTrees: :ok_hand:
 AstroHydes: And discord is a little more permanent, you can still reply to stuff you didn't read. We do have webchat history though
 dreadylein: DoublePrecisionSandwiches&#160;? ... Nice
 Wontonimo: dreadylein like a taco in a taco, but done carefully
 AllYourTrees: now i want a taco
 AstroHydes: I want taco sandwiches
 AllYourTrees: WHOA
 AllYourTrees: describe your ideal taco sandwich
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.food.com/recipe/taco-sandwich-141546">https://www.food.com/recipe/taco-sandwich-141546</a>
 AntiSquid: mayo sweetcorn
 Wontonimo: mmm , that sounds great AntiSquid
 AllYourTrees: yum
 AllYourTrees: wait does a taco sandwich have bread AND a tortilla, or just bread?
 Westicles: burrito burgers are better
 DevLorenzo: What is the best bot game?
 DevLorenzo: Other than coders strike back
 DevLorenzo: here at codingame
 Counterbalance: whichever one you enjoy the most
 Theino: Spring Challenge 2021
 Theino: because its the newest!
 DevLorenzo: Other?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIoCn_9QTVU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIoCn_9QTVU</a>
 KnightMoves: Code of Ice and Fire is pretty dope
 NinjaDoggy: code of ice and fire best game&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: Westicles "burrito burgers" sounds better also
 AstroHydes: It depends on state of inebriation and/or hunger + storecupboard ingredients if at home
 AntiSquid: Botters of the Galaxy  , DevLorenzo
 AllYourTrees: have a good weekend ya'll :wave:
 AntiSquid: bye
 AstroHydes: Later AllYourWhat
 AstroHydes: AllYourTrees
 AntiSquid: i do like fireworks should i recommend that too&#160;?
 KelvinAndHubbles: the Spring Challenge mentions you can only do one of four possible actions, but is there no action limit?
 KelvinAndHubbles: per turn that is
 Nagatwin: 1 action per turn
 KelvinAndHubbles: I mean per day
 Nagatwin: as many action as you want per day
 KelvinAndHubbles: ahh, thx
 AstroHydes: One per turn, just don't mix turns up with days
 Nagatwin: the only limit is your sun points
 KelvinAndHubbles: and your dormants mostly too I'm guessing
 AntiSquid: oh i thought he meant possible actions for a given turn, no idea how to calculate that
 KelvinAndHubbles: no, just me misreading the rules and read playing one of four possible commands to playing one  to four commands
 Nagatwin: 37 source tree for see * 36 target cells + 37 grow action / complete action + 1 wait action gives an upper bound at leasty
 Nagatwin: seed*
 AntiSquid: Nagatwin with max bound i found out a level 3 tree can cast up to 3 cells of shadow * 6 directions * 37 cells = 666 @_@
 Nagatwin: that's some deep thought
 Smelty: eee
 AntiSquid: illuminati confirmed, say it Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: my guess is that it is
 Astrobytes: Alright, chill time, gn all
 AntiSquid: gn
 AstroHydes: gn from him and gn from me
 DevLorenzo: Thx AntiSquit
 Westicles: What is the worst bot game?
 struct: yavalath, yinsh, othello and amazons
 AntiSquid: including community games&#160;? if not then either UTTT or Crystal Rush (ya i am close to legend but i hate it, why i gave up on it)
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: tell us your least liked games jacek
 Marchete: UTTT, PCR, PR2, CSB and many more
 FunkyNoob: few people shares the code after a clash, should there be some revard system implemented?
 AntiSquid: for not playing clash during contest definitely
 FunkyNoob: what i was there 504
 FunkyNoob: ahh ok, lets see the contest
 Smelty:    . . .
 Rilesworth: Are there any TypeScript/Angular stuff here?
 mybk: TypeScript it's a language that you can use to solve problems, contest, clash of code...., Angular is a ui framework, you can practice that if you have an idea to create a tool , but if you want to practive angular, not the right place 
 AntiSquid: :relieved::point_up:
 Nerchio: :point_up_2:
 Rilesworth: Understood.  I just know that TypeScript is used in tandem with Angular.  I just didn't see any TypeScript on here.
 mybk: go to any problem and change the language 
 mybk: select TypeScript
 Westicles: Except Nintendo
 Rilesworth: AhhhI was looking under the learn section
 Rilesworth: TY
 mybk:&#160;;) 
 mybk: have fun
 Nerchio: new mod when
 Rilesworth: I will.  I just got handed a project and I have zero xp with it
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/WKpD3zG">https://ibb.co/WKpD3zG</a> what just happened
 AntiSquid: you posted a dodgy looking link
 Smish314: who's gonna take the risk and click it?
 jacek: its legit
 cegprakash: okay I'm unable to penetrate through top 500 may be something is happening out there..
 BlaiseEbuth: Does the top 500 want to be penetrated?
 Maciulis: pass
 Westicles: Oh, now I get DPS!
 AntiSquid: it's dangerous out there, lock doors so the outside doesn't penetrate
 Illedan: Hi
 BlaiseEbuth: Hiii
 AntiSquid: Hii
 Smelty: hiiii
 Kumbi: is it possible to get to silver? or only on monday?
 Nerchio: starting from monday yeaj
 Nerchio: yeah
 AntiSquid: silver was yesterday
 AntiSquid: you're too late
 Nerchio: antisquid is your bot made with jokes from chat
 Smelty: hmm
 AntiSquid: no, didn't add any yet
 Smelty: mine is made up of rickroll
 Nerchio: oh god i didnt see any yet but a bot that sings rickroll is a great idea
 Smelty: x
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: battle mine
 elijah.toppo: finally, I'm getting in the top 500s..
 elijah.toppo: xD
 Smelty: ...oh you're higher rank then me nerchio
 Smelty: about...100 ahead
 AntiSquid: Nerchio it only works well if you bot is very high and you keep submit spamming dragging others down, then they are forced to chec replays
 Nerchio: yeah still i can play it in the ide... it sigs..
 Nerchio: sings
 Smelty: here nerchio <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548500355">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548500355</a>
 Nerchio: now i've seen everything
 Smelty: lol
 Nerchio: AntiSquid just wait for me to write my uber optimized bitset search in java
 Smelty: oh lawd
 Smelty: im using java xD
 AntiSquid: how do i add messages?
 AntiSquid: oh it worked
 Nerchio: you don't read game statement?
 Nerchio: :sunglasses:
 AntiSquid: no, i read chat, people ask so many questions for you ...
 Nerchio: what happens if i paste code is it going to create a link
 Nerchio: or i will get ban hammered by antisquid
 AntiSquid: chat has pastebin
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92984f95-759f-4e09-8c59-0402ecaed816">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92984f95-759f-4e09-8c59-0402ecaed816</a>
 Nerchio: how do you like that
 AntiSquid: omfg ...
 Nerchio: pretty? :grinning:
 AntiSquid: there got to be a way to refactor that
 Nerchio: do i need to though
 AntiSquid: are those your row / columns? lol
 AntiSquid: i see where your bots become successful, you have the "JUST DO IT!" approach
 Nerchio: haha lol true
 Nerchio: domiko used BFS i chose a more straighforward approach
 Nerchio: don't need BFS in this game :innocent:
 Counterbalance: I also use bfs, but the assembly kind
 AntiSquid: "it's not much, but it's honest work"
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance huh 
 Counterbalance: bit scan forward
 AntiSquid: i don't have BFS btw, but why would you need BFS?
 Counterbalance: 			uint64_t todo = d1mask;			while (todo&#160;!= 0) {				int idx = bsf(todo);				todo &amp;= ~(1ULL &lt;&lt; idx);
 ZarthaxX: ah yeah
 ZarthaxX: using the variable as a queue
 ZarthaxX: know that one&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: is that it?
 Counterbalance: yes
 ZarthaxX: bfs using var as a queue
 Nerchio: AntiSquid to calculate distance 1..2..3.. from a cell to do seed lookup
 Counterbalance: uint64_t neighbourCache[4][MAX_CELLS];
 AntiSquid: i have a shortcut to that
 ZarthaxX: we allhave that haha
 Nerchio: :pizza:
 fvla: Does anyone know if the servers have AVX/SSE capabilities?
 struct: yes
 struct: avx2
 fvla: thanks!
 fvla: guessing that also implies sse
 struct: yes
 fvla: and is the compiler GCC?
 struct: yes
 therealbeef: See FAQ
 fvla: oh dear, it was all in the faq
 fvla: thank you so much
 fvla: ...sorry I have to ask, but where is the FAQ?
 Mistblinde: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 fvla: Thanks! I only just found out that the link was all the way at the bottom...
 Smelty: sigh-
 Smelty: uh hi
 Smelty: [silence]
 Nerchio: :mouse:
 Smelty: e
 Smelty: just resubmitted hoping for best :pray:
 Nerchio: how many lines u got
 Smelty: uh lemme c
 Smelty: he actual code with comments is 113
 Smelty: and then another 50 lines is rickroll code
 Nerchio: O.O
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: lemme delete comments and shorten code, just a sec
 Nerchio: i have 750 but current submit is probably more like 300
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: im still playing matches, at 650 rn
 Tiramon: damn simulation bot should be working but i don't get enough sims done to get good results ...
 cegprakash: Tirasim
 Smelty: Rip
 Smelty: smelse
 Nerchio: how many states you got tiramon
 Smelty: also nerchio after comment deletion its at exactly 100 lines 
 Nerchio: short&#160;:)
 Smelty: add the rick and its 152
 Smelty: ye short
 Tiramon: to less to talk about&#160;;)
 Nerchio: i only need to add shade logic
 Nerchio: move generation is done
 Smelty: congrats.
 Tiramon: simulation shoudl be completly done ... algo is just to slow
 Smelty: i don't even consider shade or neighbor cells...
 Smelty: dang
 Smelty: v.1.9.6 just beat v.1.9.4 by 50 points....dang
 Tiramon: k currently i simulte between 3 and 7k turns
 Tiramon: *simulate
 Smelty: thats a large margin
 Smelty: 3-7000
 Tiramon: 3k-7k
 Smelty: ah
 Smelty: makes more sense lol
 Smelty: also i just take the "possible moves" and compare them to my optimal planting spots to see if it is possible xD
 Tiramon: and i'm still wasting more than 30ms ... no idea why ...
 Smelty: interesting.
 struct: days or turns Tiramon?
 Tiramon: turns
 Tiramon: days is a to abstract measurement&#160;;)
 Smelty: xD
 Tiramon: k between 5k and 12k better ...
 Smelty: noice
 Tiramon: still the results are totaly stupid
 Marchete: on 100ms?
 Smelty: e
 MSmits: well i dont have performance issues, but my bot plays like crap, probably due to bugs and/or bad eval
 struct: MSmits eval is hard
 Smelty: F
 struct: my bot played like crap for a long time
 struct: Took me more than 1 day for a decent eval
 Smelty: struct u twelfth now&#160;:((
 Smelty: you still smash me though
 MSmits: I use 10 ms of runtime for a beamsearch with a beamwidth of 5000 and 20 turns depth
 MSmits: though i am not ruling out that i get this good perf. due to bug
 Smelty: hmm
 struct: that must be a bug
 MSmits: yeah its probably bug
 MSmits: because i get 14 turns in one day at some point
 MSmits: thats not possible
 Smelty: wwwwwhhat
 Smelty: yea thats probably bug
 Marchete: are you sure depth 20 has any useful data?
 Marchete: I don't know
 Marchete: in HS I get it
 struct: Mine is depth 20
 struct: but is bad
 Marchete: 8 turns to bomb
 Marchete: but here...
 MSmits: struct yours is not bad
 struct: meh
 Marchete: here enemy actions matter faster
 MSmits: exactness is not much of a big deal though, who cares if one hex get blocked, you can get another one
 struct: Yeah I lowered depth and my bot seems better I think
 Smelty: normally before i upload i play a couple games vs my old bot to see if i improved
 struct: I havent tested it much though
 struct: I added chokudai
 Marchete: how exactness is not a big deal
 struct: But havent tested much
 MSmits: because the biggest factor in winning is deciding when to seed and when to grow and such
 MSmits: that wont change just because 10 turns from now some specific hex is blocked
 Smelty: j,,
 Marchete: you decide to grow at depth 15
 Marchete: and imaginary tree
 Smelty: lol
 Marchete: that enemy took on 10
 MSmits: yeah doesnt matter
 MSmits: because the imaginary tree could be somewhere else
 MSmits: and do just as well, or nearly as well
 Mourfette: Do you guys use the given possibleActions or do you compute your own actions? 
 Tiramon: it might be important for shadows etc
 Smelty: i generally try to have around 5 non-fully grown trees at once
 struct: compute my own
 Smelty: Mourfette i evaluate my best planting positions to see if they are valid using given actions 
 Marchete: I imply "simulation doesn't matter"
 MSmits: just like in HS you'd be blowing up boxes 40 turns from now that are long gone before you actually get there
 Smelty: but then again i use if/else and am ranked 400 so
 Marchete: I had 12 depth
 MSmits: i tried in HS, depth 40  or depth 70. Gave same result
 MSmits: 70 wasnt worse
 Smelty: . 0 .
 Marchete: 8 turns to explode
 Smelty: hrmm
 MSmits: yes, but... depth 70
 MSmits: long depth with a lot of inaccuracy doesn't necessarily hurt you
 MSmits: depends on the game. Just a matter of trial and error
 Marchete: MCTS style
 Marchete: but I don't see it here
 Mourfette: Yeah I'm trying to compute the best seeds actions but I need to find a better way to travel between cells in a direction because using neighbors indexes is terrible
 MSmits: my gut feeling says it doesnt hurt you in this game. But it will help to incorporate some early depth opponent prediction
 Marchete: as much as I agree on HS
 Marchete: at least
 MSmits: it's simply impossible to predict far ahead here
 MSmits: for the opponent
 MSmits: not doable
 Illedan: No need for 20 depth here :P
 Marchete: how deep then?
 Marchete: Ille&#160;?
 Marchete: being 5th
 Marchete: congrats btw
 Illedan: Me? I'm at 4
 Marchete: 4 depth?
 MSmits: well there's a python bot at rank 1
 MSmits: so...
 Marchete: I think beam depth 20 is just noise
 Marchete: a wishful thinking 
 MSmits: i think it depends on the quality of your eval
 Illedan: ^
 MSmits: if your eval incorporates long term planning
 MSmits: then you dont need as much depth
 MSmits: but thats not necessarily easy to do
 MSmits: in HS it's impossible
 MSmits: maybe here it isn't
 Marchete: more with 4 players
 Marchete: time to explode etc
 Marchete: but here it's more doable to take enemy into account
 Marchete: at least some basic one
 Marchete: even heuristic, I don't know
 orangesnowfox: ... What do people do on their last day at a job, with no tasks left but to answer questions from the person you were training?
 Marchete: assert dominance
 ZarthaxX: Illedan beamsearching with 4 depth??
 Marchete: don't tell Ille :D
 Illedan: GA.
 Marchete: ahh
 ZarthaxX: i hope you are memeing
 Marchete: always GA :D
 Illedan: SGA*
 ZarthaxX: is this not a meme?
 Marchete: SEGA?
 Marchete: good games
 ZarthaxX: Simulated Genetic A star
 ZarthaxX: D:
 Illedan: Nah, from my last Post Mortem 
 Illedan: 3 pod thing
 Marchete: my brain filter out any GA wording
 ZarthaxX: dude loves evolution haha
 ZarthaxX: are you considering actions inside a day?
 ZarthaxX: or already doing through days
 ZarthaxX: nice results btw
 Marchete: I'll review your PM
 ZarthaxX: everyone will
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Marchete: but if I can change it to smitsi, I'd do it
 Marchete: GA waste a lot of statistical info
 Marchete: just because
 Illedan: Hard to model this into smitsi
 jfaixo: 4 turns or 4 days&#160;? :P
 Marchete: and not in GA?
 Illedan: I'll keep specifics a secret&#160;;)
 Marchete: well done
 ZarthaxX: beast
 jfaixo: haha
 Marchete: but I'd code the gene on high level actions maybe
 MSmits: i wouldnt bother with smitsi here Marchete
 Marchete: why
 MSmits: you run into issues with shading and sunpoints
 MSmits: some iterations, some actions will be available and sometimes you wont have enough points
 MSmits: hexes being blocked as well
 struct: ok
 Marchete: GA is M-M-M-M-M-M
 orangesnowfox: "what is smitsi"
 struct: Im testing lower depth and is better
 struct:&#160;:/
 Marchete: GA enemy is M-M-M-M-M
 ZarthaxX: struct :D
 Marchete: smitsi is mostly the same
 struct: I increase beam width though
 Marchete: wishful thinking
 struct: with chokudai
 ZarthaxX: ah
 struct: 70% vs current submit
 orangesnowfox: "what's chokudai"
 Marchete: wow
 Marchete: 70?
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mayoko/library/blob/master/ChokudaiSearch.cpp">https://github.com/mayoko/library/blob/master/ChokudaiSearch.cpp</a>
 struct: yeah
 struct: same eval
 ZarthaxX: just a beamsearch with increasing width
 Marchete: lel
 Marchete: that's not a "tiny" improvement
 ZarthaxX: submittttt
 orangesnowfox: So, like a funnel beam? 
 struct: Maybe if I change to depth 1 I can get rank 1 back :D
 ZarthaxX: funnel?
 ZarthaxX: idk tha
 ZarthaxX: lol
 orangesnowfox: like, it funnels out
 AntiSquid: what width are you using struct&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: Where are you now struct?
 ZarthaxX: dont get it orangesnowfox :P
 struct: more than 1k less than 10k
 Marchete: between 0 and yes
 MSmits: with chokudai, dont you repeat the same states every time you increase width?
 orangesnowfox: ZarthaxX, think of a cone, (like, the shape), it starts at one width (that happens to be 0 in a real cone, but that doesn't matter) and ends at another width
 ZarthaxX: ahhh
 struct: yes MSmits
 orangesnowfox: wait what?
 ZarthaxX: you can look at the code but its basically this
 struct: But it can stop repeating
 ZarthaxX: you have beam, you run it with certain widfth to certain depth
 MSmits: i dont get it
 struct: if you start finding better states
 ZarthaxX: then after that you increment width
 MSmits: oh ok
 ZarthaxX: and run it again
 MSmits: seems as easy as regular beamsearch
 ZarthaxX: orangesnowfox basically run beam search over and over increasing width, but beam HAS to finish until depth X and then restart
 struct: yeah, I just changed my beam search
 struct: to increase beam width
 ZarthaxX: you dont increase width as beamsearch is working
 orangesnowfox: ah
 ZarthaxX: you increase it as you search struct?
 MSmits: i'll put it on my list
 MSmits: thanks
 ZarthaxX: i dont get it
 ZarthaxX: are you doing choku or not lol
 struct: I complete Depth N and then increase width
 struct: then run again
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 ZarthaxX: sure thing&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's like iterative minimax
 ZarthaxX: yep
 struct: Repeat
 ZarthaxX: nothing more
 MSmits: basically, if you were to guess the optimum width before you started, regular beam search would be much better
 struct: Well that is not always possible
 MSmits: wait, maybe not
 MSmits: sometimes smaller width gives a better result no?
 struct: Bigger width at mid game is harder too reach
 struct: then on early game
 struct: it can give yes
 MSmits: then it's worth doing it multiple times
 MSmits: the difference with minimax is that the next iteration is usually 10x slower or something
 MSmits: wheras with chokudai it's only a little slower
 MSmits: and you do it many more times compared to just 1 beamsearch
 MSmits: so the price of doing chokudai as opposed to bs is quite high
 struct: also some codes of it are not 100% right
 MSmits: do you reuse any information from last iteration?
 AntiSquid: chokudai should get his own anime and theme song
 struct: no but I will now
 MSmits: how would you reuse&#160;?
 MSmits: there's no ab pruning in chokudai
 struct: sorry I mean
 MrFruit: Man, why do I always lose the first three battles
 struct: I will use best state at N width
 struct: I dont do that currently
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: how about hashing
 MSmits: are you hashing your states to avoid duplicates?
 struct: no
 MSmits: might be necessary because grow x then seed y is the same as seed y, then grow x
 Mourfette: How do you seek the best seeds? do you travel from neighbor cell to neighbor cell to travel the X distance or do you have a better thing? (or a global list of best cell to seed for each cell/distance...)
 MSmits: Mourfette not doing anything like that yet
 struct: if you ignore enemy yes
 struct: you are right
 MSmits: yeah thats what i meant
 AntiSquid: maybe restrict seed placement to a single diagonal to make it a proper beam search? get it?
 MSmits: got it :P
 MSmits: getting started on that right now
 ZarthaxX: optimizing that far may not help as you are seeing struct say less depth better
 AntiSquid: it's a good idea
 ZarthaxX: and ille too
 ZarthaxX: maybe just focus on eval
 NinjaDoggy: yea eval + opp sim seems really important compared to depth this game
 MSmits: ZarthaxX even with a depth of 6 or 8, transpositions from ordering can hurt  a lot
 MSmits: can easily make branching 10x larger
 NinjaDoggy: adding hashing also easily decreases state search by a factor of 10 though
 MSmits: if you're doing 3 things in a day, you can do them in 6 different orders
 miszu: is it beam search like previous competition?
 ZarthaxX: if you are beamsearching i doubt it
 ZarthaxX: we are not playing the exact game
 struct: yeah ill try to focus on eval
 struct: i dont really cared about performance so far
 struct: I only did bitboard because its easier
 cahyudin: hey bro
 ZarthaxX: yeah :P
 cegprakash: wow I think I submitted a good bot&#160;:)
 miszu: bitboarding? *hearing helicopter flying with PTSD of UTT bitboarding*
 cegprakash: i constantly beat a rank 300 guy
 AntiSquid: that's really good
 orangesnowfox: UTTT bitboarding is a sad state of affairs :c
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 miszu: orangesnowfox, I reach legends thanks to taht
 miszu: and MSmits optimization in my eval
 MSmits: orangesnowfox how do you mean sad state of affairs?
 AntiSquid: i think he doesn't like the game
 MSmits: uttt has some weaknesses as a competitive game, but other than that there is nothing wrong with it
 miszu: game is fun, is just the anal optimization to reach legendary was the pain
 MSmits: p1 advantage is annoying. 
 ZarthaxX: anal? D:
 miszu: bitwise operations
 Kolo9: is there any sort of strategy discussion thread for the challenge? or does it all happen in here until the end
 BrunoFelthes: MSmits, why do you count in turns not in days?
 miszu: xoring, oring and anding
 MSmits: either way is good BrunoFelthes, i just do turns because thats what my beamsearch does
 BrunoFelthes: the deep
 BrunoFelthes: ok
 AntiSquid: i guess everyone's mother second cousin neighbour uses bitboards now
 MSmits: oh, when Illedan said depth 4, he meant 4 days&#160;!?
 miszu: sometimes you don't need bitboarding
 MSmits: cuz that is a lot of depth
 MSmits: AntiSquid you dont need bitboards here
 MSmits: it's just convenient for me, because I am used to it is all
 dreadylein: well bitboards never hurt tho :P 
 Marchete: first 2 players are python
 miszu: I remember you used a ternery instead of bits
 MSmits: oh for uttt
 BrunoFelthes: MSmits, because if you do more expenses thinks, you do more days, in 20 turns... and get more sun points, and you board score will be better than turn with less days
 AntiSquid: they use bitwise numpy 
 MSmits: still do, i use many systems in a single bot
 Marchete: even bitwise numpy, python perf is low
 MSmits: ternary, binary and a system that is even more compact than ternary
 miszu: is the challenge fun/complex? I haven't start to read the rules
 rafaelSorel: since when we have this kind of limitation:
 dreadylein: is numpy vectorized&#160;?
 AntiSquid: they have a ported keras bot
 struct: I would rate it 6/10 so far
 MSmits: rafaelSorel not sure, i noticed it with cg benchmark too. I would start it and after 30-40 games it would stop
 BrunoFelthes: miszu, the rules are simple, but the game play is not trivial
 rafaelSorel: MSmits: OK
 miszu: is it doable in java or performance will be an issue once you reach gold+
 miszu: thanks BrunoFelthes
 RoboStac: It's not new, but I'm pretty sure they've reduced the number of games before you hit the limit
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: i don't like the game annoying imo
 MSmits: in cg bench you can set time between games
 BrunoFelthes: I think that for this game, search will be very important miszu
 MSmits: i think if you set it high enough it still works
 Illedan: Agreed RoboStac. Never hit it this much
 RoboStac: yeah, I doubled my oware and was still hitting the limit whereas in the past I'd never hit it before
 miszu: do it in java and avoid all mem issue or go for C++?
 MSmits: i think it's a good idea for them to lower the limit
 BrunoFelthes: C++ is always better... 
 MSmits: i always found it weird i can abuse their servers so much
 MSmits: as long as it doesnt hurt casual testing
 miszu: write unit tests and test all your little functions
 miszu: let's see if my master degree in CS will help me to solve wood 2 league
 Marchete: ok seeding always center is a bad idea
 AntiSquid: tile 0 is deadly
 MSmits: why?
 Marchete: I mean always
 Marchete: like packing all in center
 MSmits: oh yeah, you're shading yourself
 Marchete: it seems better to avoid directional
 AntiSquid: so you don't get sunburn
 miszu: hold up
 struct: best cells are probably the ones who cant be shadowed by middle cells
 miszu: there are shadows to consider?!?
 MSmits: yeah from bronze and up
 MSmits: your tree gets shaded
 miszu: rip
 MSmits: ohhh!
 MSmits: I forgot this
 MSmits: in my BS&#160;:)
 Marchete: what
 Marchete: shadows?
 AntiSquid: don't waste too much time in wood or you will miss full picture
 MSmits: yeah i have it all coded, just forgot to call the function :P
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 MSmits: well i'll go work on that then
 Marchete: :unamused:
 miszu: does considering the enemy move helps your eval?
 Marchete: it should
 MSmits: depends on how well you do it
 miszu: in theory it shouldn't make it worse
 Marchete: at least some fast heuristic
 miszu: we all know theory performance = practice performance right?
 AntiSquid: heuristic&#160;: opponent always builds mid
 Marchete: not that
 miszu: feed mid
 miszu: enough trolling, time to read the rules... sigh
 AntiSquid: ok gn
 miszu: score more points than your opponents
 miszu: mmm sounds easy
 miszu: good night!
 MSmits: gn
 MSmits: still ridiculously fast. Shade takes time to calc, but also gives me less sunpoints, so less actions. Same speed
 MSmits: probably still bugged
 miszu: but same accuracy?
 MSmits: i dont know the accuracy
 miszu: well can it beat your previous submission?
 MSmits: probably, it would be slightly less crappy
 Marchete: 2000?
 CouscousAgha: hey guys, anyone knows what does "unusable cell" means? what underline meaning does it have on the gameplay?
 NinjaDoggy: you can't seed it
 miszu: is the nutrient value shared accross all grids?
 miszu: or each grid has its own nutrient value?
 CouscousAgha: ah thanks ninja but how does a cell become unusable?
 NinjaDoggy: it's given in input
 NinjaDoggy: soil richness doesn't change
 actualCoderTrevor: *It goes down by one each time a tree is completed.
 miszu: yeah I am seeing that
 NinjaDoggy: the soil richness doesn't change
 miszu: so all tree with same richness will give the same amount of points
 NinjaDoggy: nutrients(the global variable) changes
 miszu: ok so wood 2 seems easy
 miszu: look for the richest richness and pop it
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh hm so there's some benefit to harvesting early
 miszu: suffering from success
 Xenoid: I'm not sure such an advanced strategy is necessary for Wood 2 this contest
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 miszu: advanced is when ternary datastructure is introduced
 miszu: I guess poping 1st tree that you see is good enough
 Marchete: people passed to bronze by picking the last move
 miszu: if Totoboss sucks so bad
 Marchete: or smth like that
 cegprakash: top 200&#160;:)
 cegprakash: only if else
 Marchete: no loops nor anything?
 cegprakash: I mean loops with if else
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Marchete: I have 200 too with a simple heuristic
 Marchete: just to see the game
 miszu: I guess breaking your head deciding int vs int16 is not worth it
 Marchete: for wood2? absolutely
 KnightMoves: go with int
 KnightMoves: shorter to type
 miszu: so I can profit of that 0.3s that I saved
 cegprakash: 0.3 impossible
 miszu: write 10 times word 10 and time it and do the same with int16
 miszu: then take average and see how much extra it takes to type 16
 miszu: word int**
 itzluku: how do u guys consider shadows
 itzluku: for what case
 rafaelSorel: good question&#160;:)
 rafaelSorel: I have no clue, for now I don't use it 
 rafaelSorel: what are the strategies for that....
 itzluku: maybe when deleting a t3 tree
 itzluku: also: when are the best times to delete t3 trees
 rafaelSorel: the thing is the sun keeps turning 
 rafaelSorel: so it hard to monitor, predict the while thing
 itzluku: yup you need to calculate some resulting board structures and weight them
 RoboStac: pretty sure that last question is basically 'Also how do I win the game?'
 rafaelSorel: yes I guess
 miszu: git gud
 itzluku: well
 rafaelSorel: RoboStac lool
 itzluku: if u observer some to10 players u can find some explicit strategies
 itzluku: like, for day0 and day1 for example
 miszu: hint: it's not spamming the wait command
 itzluku: just asking what explicit rules u guys implemented:)
 itzluku: testing my new bot rn , 54% #160
 miszu: I need to check my UTTT code to refreshen my c++ skillz
 itzluku: iom not that off alrdy without shadows xd
 itzluku: what place are u guys?
 rafaelSorel: As you've said, watching top players game may lead to some explicit strategies, but be aware that may be some kind of simulation implemented out there 
 itzluku: even for simulations
 itzluku: first few days can still be the same everytime
 itzluku: almost
 itzluku: maybe some rock patterns yoik even that
 itzluku: yoink*
 itzluku: uh i might make top100
 itzluku: surpassed eulersche zahl :D
 rafaelSorel: I think from what I ve watched, taking shadow into the calculations may be handy in the final days
 itzluku: if i have more than 6 t3 trees i start deleting some
 itzluku: maybe i shoudl only delete t3 trees that are useless anyway for the next view days
 itzluku: sth like that
 itzluku: but it shouldnt be such a huge factor
 itzluku: i think
 itzluku: also: do u like to build seeds near an enemy?
 MrFruit: I try to build seed towards the middle
 MSmits: holy sht, my nth element sign was off
 MSmits: &lt; instead of &gt;
 MSmits: yeah keeping the 5000 worst states instead of 5000 best
 MSmits: nice bugs today
 struct: :D
 ZarthaxX: :F
 ZarthaxX: imaghine getting first with that
 MSmits: well i was 1800th so not reall y:P
 struct: maybe I have that bug
 struct: I can only hope
 MSmits: doubtful&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: well higher than 1800 already at 20%
 MSmits: I guess you get about 130 points with a good bot right?
 MSmits: I am at 80-90 now
 itzluku: how is the first always winning with deleting everythin after day 16
 Wontonimo: i left for a few hours and went from being in the top 2% to 2.7%.  
 itzluku: hahaha wtf
 Wontonimo: oh how the competition is growing
 ZarthaxX: like your trees
 ZarthaxX: THEY ARE DED
 Marchete: simplistic heuristic is 200th
 rafaelSorel: :laughing:
 ZarthaxX: win()&#160;?
 Notter: What are heuristics?
 MSmits: if else rules
 MSmits: and maybe some loops
 miszu: and some calculations
 Marchete: and my sword
 miszu: and a wait command
 MSmits: if (I have sunpoints) grow/seed/complete
 ZarthaxX: and a ban
 MSmits: else wait
 rafaelSorel: wait is pretty handy&#160;:)
 miszu: as a pro, you should wait on 1st turn
 Wontonimo: Notter an example of a heuristic for chess is that a knight is worth 2 pawns (I don't know if that is correct but you get the point)
 rafaelSorel: naaaa
 miszu: then if you beat the AI after then it means your AI is superior
 Wontonimo: Notter basically anything that is a proxy for an informed decision
 ZarthaxX: i think you killed him with that terminology :P
 rafaelSorel: miszu if we consider a bunch of if else an AI, so yes
 miszu: your machine is just of is else
 miszu: if*
 Wontonimo: sigh ... my kids talk like nerds also and complain their friends need simpler words of every other sentence
 rafaelSorel: basically yes :D
 MSmits: this is what my beamsearch looks with time/depth/states
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/57af1fe0-4757-4d5c-ad6d-076d47df2d5c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/57af1fe0-4757-4d5c-ad6d-076d47df2d5c</a>
 ZarthaxX: broken asf?
 MSmits: time is microseconds so 16 microseconds
 MSmits: milliseconds i mean
 MSmits: I think this is normal
 ZarthaxX: 4 actions constantly per turn?
 ZarthaxX: day
 MSmits: mo
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: this is the state with the most actions
 rafaelSorel: you've already implemented a beamsearch&#160;?
 MSmits: so there is at least one series of 4 actions
 MSmits: but most will have less
 rafaelSorel: it is not overkill at this stage&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: okey
 MSmits: if course it is overkil
 ZarthaxX: rafaelSorel you should do what you like
 ZarthaxX: and it may the best later
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: also
 MSmits: i just know i will be doing it anyway, so why not start with it
 ZarthaxX: beamsearch depth 1 with big width = your if else stuff
 ZarthaxX: so who cares
 rafaelSorel: looool, correct
 Wontonimo: for perspective, at this point i'm 125th and all i have is if/else statements
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo gg you beated me
 Wontonimo: no search
 MSmits: i think if else stuff might be better than depth 1 bs, if else is smarter than just looking at next turn
 ZarthaxX: i will retire crying
 ZarthaxX: MSmits ye
 Wontonimo: lol
 ZarthaxX: i think its cool to do if else and then use that knowledge for a search
 MSmits: yes, there's good reason for making a heuristic bot first
 ZarthaxX: which im not doing anyway
 struct: Too bad I cant write them
 ZarthaxX: :DDDDDDDDDDD
 MSmits: often you can use the heuristics for pruning or eval
 ZarthaxX: yup
 miszu: serious question: what you do with trees. Do you make a list of trees for each player or what?
 MSmits: uint64_t trees[4];
 miszu: I have a struct for a tree
 miszu: but yes, an int is good enough
 MSmits: i am not using an int for a tree
 Smelty: wha-t
 WolfDarrigan: had an object, but switching over to int[37] for now
 MSmits: i am using a uint64_t for all trees for size 0,1, 2 and 3
 MSmits: so 4 uint64_t for all trees together
 miszu: that int for each size is a bitboard of their location?
 MSmits: yes
 miszu: bruuuh
 miszu: is that useful?
 Zaphus: anyone using C++ and timed the reading of the trees?   I'm just doing: cin &gt;&gt; cellIndex &gt;&gt; size &gt;&gt; isMine &gt;&gt; isDormant; cin.ignore();and it is taking up to 50ms on some turns with just 9 trees on the board.  (and as low as a few ms on other similar turns)
 MSmits: for me it is, but i like using bitboards, for most it will suck
 MSmits: zaphus you probably start the timer too soon
 RoboStac: Zaphus - if you start the timer before reading the first line of input you'll include the time taken for the server to prepare the input
 RoboStac: (which includes the time taken by the other player)
 Wontonimo: Zaphus they speak wisdom.  so many of my timeout issues has come from this
 Zaphus: I'm starting this timer right after reading the number of trees - was trying to narrow down wher the time is going
 RoboStac: hmm, that should work fine then
 MSmits: i usually just start the timer after reading last input
 Wontonimo: isn't the day the first input?  i thought timer should start right after 1st line?
 Zaphus: yes, I'm moving my start/end around to find which bit is slow
 MSmits: reading input is negligible Zaphus
 MSmits: or it always was for me in every arena
 Zaphus: same here, until today
 Zaphus: ah well, I'll ignore for now
 miszu: I was thinking to make a list of my trees that I owe and if I harvest it, remove fro mthe list
 miszu: but forgot that removing an item from list is.. not obvious
 Smelty: e

 ZarthaxX: scary legend boss
 Smelty: lol
 ZarthaxX: i saw it and got scared
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 Smelty: oof..?
 ZarthaxX: roblox?
 Smelty: lol
 RoboStac: theres a bronze boss in the top 100 too that gave me a shock earlier
 Smelty: xD
 miszu: bruh, Totoboss is the scary boss name
 MSmits: lol
 JohnCM: hello everyone
 ZarthaxX: haha RoboStac :P
 Smelty: xD
 ZarthaxX: i will check that guy
 ZarthaxX: JohnCM HAI
 JohnCM: i'm back again to win
 RoboStac: #37 at the moment
 ZarthaxX: keep walking JohnCM
 JohnCM: starting at Wood2 lol
 MSmits: remember this guy? 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/bbeb5e76ecd668684edf4c4b0410c9be5601772">https://www.codingame.com/profile/bbeb5e76ecd668684edf4c4b0410c9be5601772</a>
 Smelty: wow
 ZarthaxX: saw him RoboStac, at least he didnt edit the face
 Smelty: lol he lok funeh
 ZarthaxX: we need silver and gold
 JohnCM: now it's up to Bronze right?
 BlitzProg: I'm struggling to understand which AI approach is best
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: went from around 40 to 143 overnight rip
 ZarthaxX: yes JohnCM
 BlitzProg: how can you tell if beam search, minimax or genetics is going to make the difference?
 Smelty: well i went from 100 to 500 overnight
 MSmits: experience mostly BlitzProg
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: damn smelty
 Smelty: f in the chat for m
 Smelty: rn im at 488
 MSmits: and even then people with experience are often wrong on what the *best* way is, they just dont try the obviously bad ways
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oof
 RoboStac: some of it's knowing what the strengths of each are and what the game involves (eg beam search is usually terrible when opponent moves have a big impact on you), part of it is just trying things and seeing if it works
 Wontonimo: so true MSmits
 MSmits: and RoboStac
 RoboStac: and the other part is lurking in chat to see what people say and stealing it
 Wontonimo: it's humbling at times when you think you know but you arn't
 Marchete: ^
 BlitzProg: lol
 BlitzProg: you can only scroll so far in the chat
 Smelty: xD
 BlitzProg: well, I'll have a go with beam search first and see what happens
 JohnCM: oh this is new: we have access to game's source code now
 Smelty: xD
 BlitzProg: It's been here for a while
 BlitzProg: years in fact
 Smelty: Blitz try doing if/else  first xD
 BlitzProg: i did a if (mine) complete;
 BlitzProg: and I got into bronze
 BlitzProg: i'm ready for the big AIs now
 itzluku: lol i didnt realise nutrient
 itzluku: thats why i lose if they sell before me
 itzluku: xd
 miszu: I think I am ready to best the mighty Totoboss
 miszu: beat*
 Wontonimo: best also works.  sounds more fancy
 miszu: yeah I realized
 miszu: the battle to the wood 1 will be legendary
 miszu: having a master in CS was very useful in wood 2
 miszu: GG boyz
 miszu: wood 1 here we go
 itzluku: i hope thatw as a joke xd
 Wontonimo: woot, i finally coded an ability for my bot to throw seeds 3 squares. lol
 Wontonimo: got into the top 200 without being able to do that.  let's see what changes with range of 3
 miszu: I hope no disaster
 Wontonimo: no, it's doing better for sure.  allows to get out of your own shadow
 Wontonimo: especially if you prefer "knights moves"
 miszu: should you spend all your sunpoints whenever you can in a day or no?
 Wontonimo: no
 DetoBot: let's test against Illedan
 DetoBot: hmm... clear KO for my bot
 DetoBot: :stuck_out_tongue:
 Wontonimo: miszu look at some replays of the top bots.  you see lots of them save from round to round to do bigger projects like buying a 5th Big tree
 cleverusername82: im going to say it
 Wontonimo: say it
 Zenoscave: say it
 miszu: if I understand the game, it's not worth to complete your tree until the last day
 miszu: well at least in wood 1
 itzluku: in bronze nutrition comes to play
 itzluku: =)
 miszu: oh right
 miszu: rush size 3 and chop
 itzluku: also shadow might be a factor to determine when to sell
 DetoBot: a simple "NO-AI" strategy is not to harvest before you have enough
 miszu: no shadow in wood 1 yet
 itzluku: get to the chop er&#160;:^)
 miszu: Rush B
 itzluku: just lost 118 to 119
 itzluku: XD
 Rag: sad
 miszu: opponent be like: I owned you man.
 Wontonimo: well, it ain't false
 Wontonimo:&#160;:)
 miszu: owned is when you beat opponent by like 15 points
 Zenoscave: how are you guys doing the shadow bitboards? int64's?
 Wontonimo: i'm not.
 miszu: shadow clone jutsu
 Wontonimo: i will if i end up writing a simulator
 klforthwind: i dont think you need int64s for shadow bitboards, but I have yet to fully  implement it right now
 Zenoscave: something like long[6][37][4]
 klforthwind: so I could be very wrong ;p
 miszu: do you compute multiple moves in advance?
 miszu: or just the best next move
 Zenoscave: ply 0 currently
 Wontonimo: you need to have enough info to keep track of the height of the shadow
 Zenoscave: Working on sim today
 Zenoscave: that's the [4] part
 miszu: most AI games is all about the sims
 Wontonimo: Zenoscave what's the [6] part for?
 Zenoscave: day rotation
 itzluku: i wonder how hard it will be to get from score 50 to 60
 Wontonimo: hmm... so you calculate ALL the days in advance?  it's that too much that gets thrown out
 itzluku: how much it increases by adding shadows to the equation
 Rag: I wonder how many from bronze will go to silver
 Zenoscave: why do people throw it out?
 Zenoscave: Wontonimo is there a better way you've heard of
 itzluku: @Rag alot, the bronze ai is really bad
 Wontonimo: what i mean is, you'll have to load all that data from ram across the bus to the cpu.  How expensive is it to create the days data when you need it?
 itzluku: i wonder how many bots skip silver xd
 Zenoscave: hmmmm. but forward day sim caching no?
 Rag: Maybe bronze boss is hard =P
 klforthwind: none of them will skip silver, since silver will come out, and gold will come out another day I thought
 Zenoscave: cpu cache should beable to store 3.5kb
 klforthwind: wait, how much memory are we allowed to use? does it say anywhere?
 itzluku: there is no more tick after silver
 itzluku: maybe after silver is released there will be no time barrier
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Zenoscave: klforthwind
 Wontonimo: how many copies of that data structure are there?  are you using something like beam, minimax, or mcts where you save copies?
 klforthwind: tyty
 Zenoscave: Ah true. Forgot it isn't global or stationary
 Zenoscave: good point wontonimo
 itzluku: what the sim depth&#160;? maybe just one sun rotation&#160;?
 Zenoscave: 600B is much easier to swallow
 Wontonimo: i got hammered in UTTT about having too large of a data structure ... so it's fresh in my memory Zenoscave , that's all.
 Zenoscave: Good to know!!
 mybk: Oracle JDK 1.8.0 / OpenJDK 11.0.2 (depends on played game)	
 mybk: what does that mean&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: some of the newer games have been upgraded to openJDK 11
 Wontonimo: and the older ones will still use the old jdk so that the old bots still work
 mybk: so right know (with this contest) openJDK 11 
 DetoBot: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 DetoBot: :grin: Even this error exists
 mybk: good practice / clean code
 DetoBot: How long to wait now?
 mybk: emm I don't know :p never happened to me, seen someone mention it before that's it
 Zenoscave: DetoBot about 4-5 min
 DetoBot: thanks
 Zenoscave: if you wait 20 seconds between each match click the cooledown timer resets enough to avoid that forever
 DetoBot: okay :grinning:
 DetoBot: glad it's working again
 Wontonimo: oh, i'm close to your bot Zenoscave!  
 itzluku: what place
 Zenoscave: That's my bot from yesterday&#160;;) was 7th 20 hours ago :laughing:
 Wontonimo: 100-115
 itzluku: damn
 Zenoscave: doing a mass rework for sim organization now
 Wontonimo: cool
 itzluku: i alrdy have classes etc for that
 Wontonimo: i look forward to seeing your sim bot crush Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: let's hope
 Zenoscave: might make the whole state one flat long array
 Zenoscave: easy to pass and avoids heap allocation i *think*
 Wontonimo: i had an if/else bot for SC2020 (the pacman game) and then wrote a MCTS sim.  The sim did worse.  It was very demotivating.
 Wontonimo: but this competition is way more like UTTT than SC2020, and UTTT was all about highly optimized sim
 Zenoscave: does a struct stay in stack in C#?
 KelvinAndHubbles: welp, fix bugs, resubmitted, went down a hundred places, hmmm
 Wontonimo: i don't have any recent experience with C#
 Zenoscave: bah array's of struct means heap
 Zenoscave: struct change your name or I'm gonna keep pinging you
 Wontonimo: Zenoscave are you making your own heap mem allocation via array indexing?
 Wontonimo: or do you plan on it?
 Zenoscave: I don't understand
 Zenoscave: array indexing like int parentIndex in the struct?
 Wontonimo: so instead of using new/malloc/alloc for each time you need a new node,
 JohnCM: you know this game reminds me of a tree based game i played, i think it's called photosynthesis
 Zenoscave: JohnCM it's an adaptation
 Zenoscave: Oh yeah I plan on that Wontonimo
 JohnCM: i see.. yea i didn't like that game
 Wontonimo: upon startup allocate an array that can hold 100,000 or so.  keep a variable called next_available=0, and increment it to "allocate" another
 Wontonimo: cool cool
 Zenoscave: yup I plan it&#160;;)
 JohnCM: too complex and growing trees to destroy them isn't my kind of thing
 fvla: just use c++ for that lol
 Wontonimo: i've tried it a couple times but don't really know if it helped that much.  just blindly did it without benchmarking.
 fvla: looks like c# doesn't want you doing that
 Wontonimo: please let me know how it goes
 Zenoscave: will do.
 7amasa: Anyone has a link to a code bundler for java pleae
 Wontonimo: www.python.org
 Wontonimo: lol
 Zenoscave: funny
 Zenoscave: Most of the bundlers are made by the users on the site. if you can't find one in the forum it probably isn't available 7amasa
 Wontonimo: no , but seriously 7amasa , i ran into that problem before and i just wrote a python script to bundle
 Zenoscave: At least for code used by this sight
 7amasa: Alirght thank you so much guys, ill write one then&#160;:( xD
 Wontonimo: it really shouldn't be too hard.  how's your python/perl/awk/sed skills?
 mybk: if you find something (code bundler), tag me please @7amasa
 Wontonimo: really it isn't much more than concat all the files.  right?  am i missing something?  perhaps 2 passes, 1 pass to get all the imports and output them, then a second pass for everything else
 mybk: it's about static class 
 mybk: if I find something professional it's better 
 mybk: but you are right I can right it 
 mybk: but I am lazy person 
 7amasa: My python is okay, but as @mybk said its a hustle kinda
 mybk: the other day I found this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gist.github.com/Ohohcakester/58a8b59f397505ef6bea">https://gist.github.com/Ohohcakester/58a8b59f397505ef6bea</a>but I didn't try it though
 Enknable: so if you grow a tree, it wont cast a shadow immediately..
 mybk: doesn't matter because you get sun point at the first of the day, and you grow your tree in the middle of the day
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ae4c81d4-4f9e-4a59-963c-71e4f9e5ef84">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ae4c81d4-4f9e-4a59-963c-71e4f9e5ef84</a>
 Wontonimo: try that ^^ 7amasa and mybk
 Wontonimo: it will read in files "first.java second.java ..." and output it into a file called "combined.java"
 Wontonimo: with all the import statements at the top
 mybk: emm interesting 
 mybk: thank you Wontonimo, I will try it right away 
 Wontonimo: it may not run first go ... i just copied it from one of my scripts and edited it down quickly.
 itzluku: would be cool if the UI would show the day ...
 Wontonimo: it does, turn on debug mode
 Wontonimo: there is a gear symbol, which opens up options like debug
 Wontonimo: it's beside the share link and window maximize
 mybk: thank you Wontonimo, it works perfectly
 Wontonimo: :D
 mybk: :innocent:
 7amasa: Wontonimo Thank you :D :D 
 Kolo9: Seems like anything I try to do with shadows makes my bot worse. Best to keep it ignorant of shadows
 Kolo9: haha I'm so garbage at strategy
 Wontonimo: my bot is completely blind to shadows
 Kolo9: people in here generally already have simulators running?
 Wontonimo: i think in the top 200 it is likely but not for sure
 Kolo9: oh hey I've actually been testing my alst few runs against you haha
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: kolo try testing vs me
 Kolo9: at 182 right now with very simple heuristics from last night
 Kolo9: and I just don't know what to do
 Chainman: In the wood levels are you playing against other's code?  
 Smelty: even though your bot is way better than me
 Kolo9: it's like I watch the replays of top players destroying me
 Kolo9: and I have no idea where the points came from
 Chainman: Cause I just keep doing simple if else and get rank 1 lol? 
 Smelty: chainman yes, although teh majority of players are in bronze
 Chainman: Yeah I just started this hour. 
 DetoBot: :laughing: just KO Illedan in 1 or 6 matches 
 Kolo9: damn it Smelty I just started a game against your bot
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: 100% you win
 Smelty: i used if/else, so
 Kolo9: with your messages it feels like a loss
 Smelty: wh
 Kolo9: rickroll
 Wontonimo: oh, i gotta add messages!!
 Kolo9: also if/else? yeah that's my bot too
 Kolo9: like 4 if statements.
 Smelty: xDDDDDD
 Smelty: rickroll go brrrrr
 Smelty: ive probably rickrolled myself in testing like 100 times by now
 Chainman: in bronze league now, so it will be hard I'm guessing from here. 
 Smelty: lol 
 Smelty: lmao my bot tried to grow in -1
 Chainman: how do you choose to battle a specific person?
 Kolo9: interested to hear what sorts of things people are seeing success with, if anyone's sharing. I see MCTS and GA thrown around all the time on here but familiar enough with them to understand if this game is a good candidate
 Smelty: ..y'know, i spent 50 lines of code writing a rickroll
 Kolo9: @Chainman at bronze you have all the rules! it's currently the highest open league so all of the top players are in it
 fvla: I'm seeing a lot of success with if/else /s
 Smelty: ikr
 Kolo9: ditto dudes
 Chainman: haha nice
 Smelty: lol
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: you can get top 100 without simulation
 Smelty: bruh why my tree growing -s
 Smelty: negatives
 Smelty: sad face
 Kolo9: oh also Chainman in the IDE, at the bottom you can "DELETE" the default AI and search for whoever you want to play against
 Smelty: yep
 Kolo9: can even delete yourself too and watch others' bots play
 Kolo9: nice NotSureWhyThisWorks
 StyllyMyle: so
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: also, you can test vs ur arena bot
 Smelty: i do that for testing for improvements
 StyllyMyle: nvm, im trying to rank up
 StyllyMyle: nowhere happy with top 1000&#160;:/
 Smelty: lol im in 5-- somehow
 Smelty: *500
 Smelty: used to be 100
 StyllyMyle: OOOH nice
 icecream17: i havent changed my code today
 Smelty: bruv i keep losing=
 Smelty: hi icecream
 Smelty: hows the code lol
 icecream17: well i kinda tried to implement the whole game
 icecream17: and i do have some success!
 StyllyMyle: How many times does our player turn before sun direction changes?
 icecream17: possibleMoves always includes 'WAIT'
 icecream17: and the 'GROW' also matches
 icecream17: although it thinks i can seed across half the board whenever i want
 Smelty: wow.
 Smelty: xD
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: will possible moves remain in the higher leagues?
 icecream17: floodfill is famously hard for me to implement
 Smelty: alright submitted new algo, hoping for best
 Smelty: tbh im often too lazy to implement simulation
 Smelty: i prefer to stay in if/else gang if possible
 Smelty: NotSureWhyThisWorks Hopefully, currently im using it to evaluate if my planting positions are ok
 icecream17: although the first time it worked was on platinum rift which is ridiculous
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I'm worried I will have to switch from if/else to simulation to stay in top 100
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: we'll see
 Smelty: i just resubmitted
 Smelty: currently 700 altho still battlin
 icecream17: since that grid is also hexagonal and much more complicated too
 Chainman: nice
 Smelty: true.
 Smelty: 22%, 591
 Smelty: hoping for best
 Smelty: bruh i just got kicked down
 Wontonimo: hey Smelty, what's your search?  minimax, mcts, something else?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: rip
 Chainman: My rank increase while I'm not doing anything lol 
 DetoBot: :joy: aiming high makes you earn well
 StyllyMyle: Theres always someone better
 Smelty: Wontonimo its if/else&#160;:))
 icecream17: smelty doesnt search
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: test the new algo against current bot in arena first lol
 Wontonimo: oh hahaha
 DetoBot: My bot proved that
 Smelty: lol
 Wontonimo: i thought you were submitting a simulation
 Smelty: its just a complicated algorithm with if/else and move eval
 Smelty: like i evaluate which planting is best and which grow is best
 Smelty: but in the end its just if/else
 icecream17: oh yeah, 346 &gt; detobot (399)
 StyllyMyle: bunch of if else is better than randomized stuff
 DetoBot: yeah eval is the root 
 Wontonimo: well, make it complicated enough and it will become a simulation
 Smelty: ixD
 Smelty: haha just broke 500 barrier 
 DetoBot: icecream17 getting closer to you
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: nice
 Smelty: but wow wontonimo is 125-
 DetoBot: but this isn't that I am working upon
 KCrown: if you submitted a new bot does it take while for you to climb the leaderboard? 
 StyllyMyle: Seed cant cast shadow r8?
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: to both of your questions
 StyllyMyle: lOool
 StyllyMyle: and trees have size that define how much shadow they cast
 StyllyMyle: im thinking of algo to plant trees to block my opponent
 icecream17: is there an easy way to determine distance on a hexagonal grid?
 DetoBot: near you icecream17
 StyllyMyle: but once again i think before my seed grow, the sun direction might change&#160;:(
 icecream17: :eyes:
 actualCoderTrevor: icecream17 look at how the source does it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/2785b58e5eb136fdc5349825c33454fa7838270b/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/2785b58e5eb136fdc5349825c33454fa7838270b/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java</a>
 DetoBot: once it was 311
 actualCoderTrevor: Pretty clever I think
 Smelty: yay thanks for the follow wontonimo
 fvla: source method is weak sauce
 DetoBot: Hopefully let's code a new logical bot
 fvla: you need to use template metaprogramming to precache every possible result
 Smelty: there's this map with a wall in the center-
 Wontonimo: don't let it go to your head.  this way you show up on the filter "Codingamers you follow"
 Wontonimo: lol
 Smelty: ah-
 Smelty: sad noise
 fvla: no but seriously, a pre-calculated table might be pretty fast
 Smelty: beware that my bot will rickroll you in a fight
 Wontonimo: i'm about to unleash random monty python quotes with my bot
 StyllyMyle: Lets go
 Smelty: oh god
 Smelty: monty python go brrrr
 Smelty: i got an idea. monty python quotes for first 12 days, then rickroll
 StyllyMyle: 146-67, your bot really rickrolled me smelt&#160;:)
 actualCoderTrevor: Optimizing what your bot says &gt; Optimizing what your bot does
 Smelty:&#160;:))
 Smelty: xDD
 Smelty: wise words, actualCoderTrever
 actualCoderTrevor:&#160;:)
 Smelty: mostly because idk how to improve my bot does
 Smelty: xD
 StyllyMyle: Smellt
 StyllyMyle: brooo
 StyllyMyle: you have these lines in wait
 StyllyMyle: fk its so hilarious
 StyllyMyle: Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you&#160;:)
 icecream17:&#160;:)
 Smelty: LMAO
 DetoBot: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 StyllyMyle: I can play against your bot :D
 Smelty: styllymyle i do the intro then loop the chorus
 Smelty: sure
 Wontonimo: why DetoBot why?
 <b>**DetoBot named his bot ICECREAM17</b></p><p><img src="/a/62842162200886" /> Smelty: just do it in idea and stuff
 StyllyMyle: I gotta go cya all
 Smelty: "Nobody expects the spanish inquistion"
 Smelty: cya
 icecream17: i should've screenshot that "who.. who's ..." comment from awhile ago
 Wontonimo: by StyllyMyle
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: imma make a randomizer for hte first 25 rounds
 Smelty: and spew monty python
 StyllyMyle: m
 Wontonimo: i wanted just holy grail quotes, but there isn't that many 
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: i really am dedicating 100 liens of code to what my bot syas.
 DetoBot: will the Silver league be having rules like, "A COMPLETE TREE will make CELL richness 0" :joy:
 icecream17: is there a way to map index into (x, y, z)?
 Wontonimo: oh crap, i go so carried away with adding the quotes I forgot to do version control and track my ranking&#160;:/ 
 Wontonimo: what you mean icecream17&#160;?
 Xenoid: icecream17, there are only 37 indices, so yes
 Smelty: Black Knight: “Tis but a scratch.”King Arthur: “A scratch? Your arm’s off!”
 icecream17: the game code uses (x, y, z) for distance internally
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: sorry im dying to hte quotes
 Numby: Is Bronze League the full game rules?
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's what i've been told Numby
 Numby: Cool, thanks
 Smelty: yep
 actualCoderTrevor: icecream17 IDK how the game maps them. I thought it was clever but I never implemented it like that myself. Like Xenoid said it's only 37 spaces so you can hardcode them pretty easily.
 Xenoid: Writing a 37-case switch statement is faster than trying to do something clever. For better or for worse
 Wontonimo: i just use the neighbour list that is provided at the beginning of initialization
 fvla: 37-case switch statement???That's why I brought up template metaprogramming
 Smelty: hmm
 Wontonimo: traverse it
 Smelty: i just use available moves
 Wontonimo: ^^ that works!
 icecream17: i calculate the literal cost it would take to plant a seed and grow a tree
 martinpapa69: you can implement a simulator by ignoring the fact, that the game takes place in a hexagonal map. all you need is the cells neighbours
 icecream17: and add the bonus
 Wontonimo: that's what i do also icecream17
 fvla: neigh0-5 is decent enough for a theoretical graph approach indeed
 icecream17: wonton...&#160;!
 icecream17: i should've used a pun for my username
 fvla: iscream17?
 icecream17: *gasp*
 icecream17: that's amazing
 icecream17: especially since i 1st parsed it as "is cream"
 hexa8:&#160;??
 itzluku: @Wontonimo do u consider shadows alrdy?
 Wontonimo: nope.
 Smelty: ok finished monty python quotes
 Smelty: ted
 Smelty: *submitted
 itzluku: i think our 1v1s are 50 50 shadow luck xd
 fvla: what is a shade? a miserable pile of secrets.
 Wontonimo: okay, so in a couple days Silver will open up then gold then legendary.  You can bet I'll be writing a full simulation to get into those that takes into account shadows itzluku
 icecream17: idea: spend sun to remove shadows
 Smelty: ooof
 Smelty: icecream hhmmmmm
 Smelty: legend league stuf right there
 Smelty: ok so for around 30 turns i spew monty python
 Smelty: then its rickroll
 Wontonimo: excellent!
 fvla: great!
 Smelty: try fighting me
 Smelty: some of the quotes are too long to fit though...&#160;:(
 fvla: now keep spamming quotes so that i can eventually catch up
 Smelty: lolll
 Smelty: i think im done there
 Smelty: "Black Knight: “Tis but a scratch.” King Arthur: “A scratch? Your arm’s off!”"
 icecream17: spooky shadows is a silly reason to not help...
 itzluku: smelty i cant find your bot
 itzluku: :o
 Smelty: :00
 Wontonimo: it's on!  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/548694095">https://www.codingame.com/replay/548694095</a>
 Smelty: let me fight you
 Smelty: and send u recording
 Smelty: ..oh? rock paper scissors?
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/548694268">https://www.codingame.com/replay/548694268</a>
 itzluku: damn close :P
 Smelty: best quote competition confirmed Wontomino?
 Wontonimo: i approve your bot!  thanks for the inspiration Smelty
 Smelty: no problem xD
 Smelty: ...my bot is very lacking in terms of doing stuff thoguh
 Smelty: he just likes talking
 itzluku: guys if u want to win 100% .. just play against yourself LOL
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: but- i tied
 Smelty:&#160;;-;
 icecream17: i have a very very interesting idea
 itzluku: thats possible? :D
 fvla: then you win twice!
 Smelty: icecream17 remember this? the legend tie <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548425098">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/548425098</a>
 Smelty: itzluku this is for you
 icecream17: yeah yeah iremember
 Smelty: same points, same trees
 Smelty: that was before the bot learned monty python thoug
 JohnCM: wonder if i can monte carlo this one
 KCrown: there's so many branches ... 
 JohnCM: maybe with a heuristic that is strictly good
 KCrown: this game was easy yesterday but the more I think of it the harder it got :P 
 JohnCM: it's tricky to keep growing size 3 trees, because it gets more and more expensive
 Smelty: john just kil them
 Smelty: ez pz
 JohnCM: and you can block yourself
 icecream17: i have an idea
 Smelty: solves all your problems KILL THEM
 icecream17: ignore the opponent
 JohnCM: kill the trees?
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: complete em
 icecream17: so "first player" search
 Smelty: that's what i do
 JohnCM: but if you complete them, you miss out on your 3 sun spots
 Smelty: not immediatly but whatever
 itzluku: new features in silver?
 JohnCM: it's a long run horizon planning game
 icecream17: try to find the combination of moves that results in the best score, ignoring your oppoent!
 KCrown: it has elements of go in it ... in that the placement of the tress is super important if you want t win :P 
 Smelty: ...and then the opponent blocks you lol
 JohnCM: i played this game before in real life
 Smelty: ooh...strategy
 icecream17: i hardcoded the opening: don't seed on turn 1 or 3
 icecream17: *0 or 2
 JohnCM: the spreading of seeds is very important
 JohnCM: maximize sun coverage across the sun positions
 JohnCM: though that time when i played, it was with 4 people, the board was super crowded
 Smelty: I'm going to be honest with you, I rickrolled myself so bad i've been humming the song the whole afternoon
 Smelty:&#160;:((
 JohnCM: we were just like blocking each other lol
 icecream17: it's very awesome
 JohnCM: growing trees just to block others
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: thats the point sometimes
 actualCoderTrevor: Is there any feedback to let you know if you and your opponent tried to seed the same space?
 JohnCM: in the end the sun go one cycle i only got 5-6 sun points
 KCrown: like i said it's like go only harder ...
 Smelty: well, you tried to plant and there isnt a seed there
 icecream17: sun is refunded
 Smelty: thats enough 
 Smelty: that tooo ^^
 actualCoderTrevor: icecream17 That's what I'm trying to keep track of
 icecream17: oh wow!
 Wontonimo: so here is a bit of heuristic fun&#160;: if you plant on the outside you are guaranteed 2 days of sun out of 6 
 icecream17: i thought of just throwing the seed and colliding forever as an infinite loop
 Smelty: actualCoderTrever just check hte next turn if there is a seed there
 actualCoderTrevor: I want to know if my bot is correctly predicting how much energy it should have at the end of the match
 Smelty: if not, then it was blocked
 icecream17: but the tree is disabled after a throw
 Smelty: yep
 icecream17: imagine the contest with leagues like this
 actualCoderTrevor: Smelty hmmm yeah that could work, if it's one of mine
 actualCoderTrevor: thanks&#160;:)
 icecream17: but the contest is rock paper scissors
 icecream17: only the very lucky get to move on
 Smelty: actual&#160;:))
 DetoBot: yup 
 Smelty: took wonton's advice and decided to uproot center plantsfirst
 JohnCM: imagine if we do 7 wonders in codingame
 KCrown: never thought of the edge as important thanks wontonimo
 JohnCM: the strat is in the centre grow big trees, at the side you can maintain small trees
 JohnCM: but the centre trees give the most nutrients
 JohnCM: it's a tradeoff
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: i decided to uproot center trees more than outside trees
 DetoBot: :confused: lost a 100 ranks in minutes of no-work
 Smelty: RIP
 DetoBot: well doing Smelty
 Smelty: lemme fight you
 Smelty: we are similar ranks

 Smelty: yes, i dont calculate shadows
 DetoBot: trying to simulate a few turns only
 DetoBot: days seems like nightmare
 Wontonimo: i don't either, but when throwing a seed you can prefer knightmoves
 Smelty: what dat
 Smelty: *cries in noob*
 DetoBot: calculating shadows? 
 DetoBot: oh there are shadows too
 DetoBot: I am dumb :joy:
 Smelty: whats a knightmove
 Wontonimo: knight moves means like a knight in chess, 2 straight then 1 to the side
 Smelty: ahhh
 DetoBot: let's improve my bot
 Wontonimo: or 1 straight, then 1 to the side
 Smelty: hexagons confuse me

 Smelty: um, no
 Smelty: you are a good hexaboi

 Smelty: so how do i even calculate knight moves

 Wontonimo: using the neighbour mapping that is provided at init, you can look up your neighbours
 Smelty: ye?
 Smelty: so save them in arrays
 Wontonimo: oh yeah
 Smelty: hm?

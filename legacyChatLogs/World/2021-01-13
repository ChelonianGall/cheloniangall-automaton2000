 UnnamedCodinGamer: how does one cut/paste in the IDE?
 struct: ctrl x ctrl v?
 Westicles: you can't
 struct: Isnt ctrl x cut?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 struct: I use classic, not emacs or vim
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ctrl x, ctrl v works
 Westicles: I mean you can't with just a mouse.  It is frustrating
 struct: ah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: cut from the menu does not
 struct: I never use mouse for that stuff
 Westicles: Copy is on the menu but not paste
 struct: Ah I see why 
 struct: You need to allow permission
 struct: I just tried
 struct: ah got popup asking me to permission for clipboard
 UnnamedCodinGamer: can you do that in settings?
 struct: one sec i post gif
 struct: sorry a bit slow encoding
 struct: you use chrome UnnamedCodinGamer?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: currently firefox
 UnnamedCodinGamer: never mind, ctrl x, ctrl v is good enough
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gifyu.com/image/Fn10">https://gifyu.com/image/Fn10</a>
 struct: on chrome I need to enable that permission
 struct: or doesnt allow me
 Westicles: hmm, your menu options are different than mine. 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: firefox menu in ide does not have paste
 UnnamedCodinGamer: in chrome it works
 Westicles: ah, okay I have FF as well
 struct: ah

 BlaiseEbuth: ProgrammerDog&#160;: do you want something&#160;?
 Westicles: ProgrammerDog, you are in trouble now
 BlaiseEbuth: No need to dm me.
 Westicles: It better be really good...
 BlaiseEbuth: You better be quiet Westicles.
 Westicles:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: ProgrammerDog&#160;: I just meant, don't post repeatedly your contribution's link. If you want advices, or anything, ask, but be explicit...

 Flekysek: Can maybe somebody help me with one task? 
 jacek: be more specific
 Jaystah: deutscher?
 VizGhar: Flekysek jacek helped you as much as he could
 jacek: he pmed me
 Flekysek: yes we have private conversation and jacek is tring to help me&#160;:) thanks 
 VizGhar: :grinning: just as i said
 ChampionCoder: Can you guys tell me what you think:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6077df7d033fc5a77c16113f2a19f0512451">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6077df7d033fc5a77c16113f2a19f0512451</a>
 Westicles: I'm afraid to say anything
 jacek: :thinking:
 loveCoding01: Hello
 Ernest326: Hi
 AdrianChavarria: hello 
 AdrianChavarria: how are you? 
 Ernest326: I am good
 AdrianChavarria: great! 
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: yes
 reCurse: Funny, everyone is on discord and I'd rather have webchat now
 eulerscheZahl: yay to webchat!
 reCurse: Quite upset -_-
 eulerscheZahl: RIP community contests&#160;:(
 reCurse: I don't know why I'm surprised
 reCurse: Should have been obvious
 eulerscheZahl: i try to sell my game to Neumann now but i'm not very optimistic that it's possible
 reCurse: Just such a shame there's no alternative
 Astrobytes: Grim afternoon as I just said to euler.
 reCurse: Something unique being squandered like that
 reCurse: Ugh.
 Astrobytes: I like your 'member of the 5%' btw reCurse.
 Nerchio: Puzzles of the week are new (not seen before) every time?
 eulerscheZahl: then i'll just dump the game on the contribute page where community bot can refuse it in 30 days
 reCurse: Eh
 reCurse: Have to blow some steam off somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: POTW = promoting an old puzzle
 reCurse: RIP old CG
 Nerchio: ok that's what i thought
 kovi:&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 Nerchio: i was confused what G-ROM said in the discussion
 kovi: what is new cg then?
 eulerscheZahl: i also see that tendency to please the 95% more in the game design
 reCurse: I won't answer that question
 reCurse: It will not be nice at all
 Astrobytes: &lt; old CG
 eulerscheZahl: incomplete input that hurts those 5% and is a pain to deal with
 BlaiseEbuth: kovi&#160;: coc :grin:
 reCurse: Think I'll take a walk or something
 kovi: as clash of code?
 Nerchio: in my opinion 2 big contests per year and 2 community contests in between breaks would be best
 eulerscheZahl: i did that and just came back 10min ago
 Westicles: It seems like total number of people signed up for a contest is a very important metric for them
 reCurse: Yeah they went full engagement bullshit
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should turn around and take another walk
 reCurse: We're just a vocal minority guys who cares
 Astrobytes: Truly depressing.
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you changed your status on discord
 eulerscheZahl: i'll follow along
 BlaiseEbuth: noisy more than vocal, from their view...
 Nerchio: so what exactly do you guys want i feel like nobody really explained it
 reCurse: More contests for one
 reCurse: We're even willing to provide them
 reCurse: But it would hurt their big numbers
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I mean... 
 Nerchio: I think they just don't want to promote them in the same way they do the big ones
 Astrobytes: On a plate right.
 Astrobytes: That's fine Nerchio, but they propose that they have to be 'less competitive' or something to that effect.
 Nerchio: but in my opinion clearly sticking to schedule of 2 big events, and saying to look out for a community event in the meantime would be at least a decent choice
 reCurse: It's fairly obvious what they're aiming for now
 reCurse: Ugh, not in a constructive mood. bbl
 eulerscheZahl: summary: creating multiplayers probably isn't worth the effort. takes weeks to code and only a handful of users will ever play them
 jrke: ^ agreed
 Nerchio: but community contests would be provided by community? :D
 Nerchio: so they don't put that much effort into it
 Nerchio: how about: letting the community to run the community contest (providing the game etc.) and making sure only one of these can be run in X amount of time. 
 Nerchio: then you can have a place to promote these as they become multis as well "last community contest"
 Nerchio: etc
 reCurse: Announcing them would "cannibalize" their main events, so they'd rather not
 Nerchio: well they don't need to do a giant announcement, do they? :D
 reCurse: If you want people to participate
 reCurse: A lot of competition only shows up then
 Astrobytes: Re. cannibalising, I thought there were less players in pacman because OOC &gt; pacman but... unpopular opinion perhaps.
 Nerchio: it's probably both :D
 kovi: that was too close together and long ooc
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: it was a scheduling mistake imo, which can be easily avoided
 kovi: but 2 oficial + 2 community is still 3 month per contest
 Nerchio: could put a game like this easily in the gap between 2 big events per year we have now
 Astrobytes: Well, it was an impromptu 'lockdown' event
 Astrobytes: (OOC)
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm going to cook some chickpeas in a frustrated way, afk
 MSmits: lol at all this "member of the 5%" 
 MSmits: in discord
 JBM: i thought i was the minority
 JBM: now i don't know where i stand anymore
 darkhorse64: member of the 0.1%
 BlaiseEbuth: Member of the me%
 MSmits: mmh i think you are a minority on your own :P
 eulerscheZahl: time to publish my game i guess&#160;:(
 JBM: yeah that must be it
 jrke: i joined just 5 mins ago and session time ended lol
 MSmits: yeah eulerscheZahl i'm a bit sad for you and other guys who were hoping for more contests
 JBM: i dunno if i can empathise
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl there has to a middle ground between giant community announcement ("cannibilizing the official contest") and publishing randomly
 MSmits: personally I enjoy myself regardless, but I know how much you guys want this
 JBM: CCs were announced as closed for more than a year now
 darkhorse64: Sorry, Discord is banned at my workplace. Could someone make a short summary of the annoucements&#160;?
 Nerchio: there wasn't really announcements more like discussion
 MSmits: not me, i was in and out due to work
 JBM: (17:25:17) eulerscheZahl: summary: creating multiplayers probably isn't worth the effort. takes weeks to code and only a handful of users will ever play them
 MSmits: i dont agree with this though, looking at Onitama for example. Quite succesful imho and it will continue to grow
 struct: Yeah, very disapoiting outcome
 eulerscheZahl: Onitama was a short weekend project
 darkhorse64: No backing at all from CG to run these community contests (leagues and such)&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: struct knows my other game already. much more effort
 struct: yeah, euler spent a lot of time on it
 jrke: damn i can understand your feeling euler
 jacek: good afternoon
 MSmits: Oh ok. Well maybe we should promote it more when you release it eulerscheZahl
 struct: MSmits it wont do much imo
 jrke: promoting by us and promoting by CG is having great difference
 MSmits: true
 kovi: i'm really sorry about it eulerand while we are at it, big kudos for you and any content-crafter
 MSmits: ^
 eulerscheZahl: random release here we go <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5118d71262a5772672a3a604a0a53942eb12">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5118d71262a5772672a3a604a0a53942eb12</a>
 struct: comunity games dont get much love
 struct: from bugs, to feature requests
 jrke: don't worry eulerscheZalh we all will do our best to promote it
 jacek: :c
 MSmits: ohh looks cool
 darkhorse64: A 50 times difference at least in terms of audience
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: that game i just shared even has some new features
 MSmits: not at least, on average
 eulerscheZahl: debug drawing commands (LINE, CIRCLE, RECT, TEXT)
 MSmits: he may get between 300-500,
 eulerscheZahl: which you can toggle in visibility
 jacek: ohh, a path finding game
 eulerscheZahl: customizable color. you can assign a fixed color to yourself so you are always red
 jrke: "in Bronze league all rules will be unlocked" feeling bad for you euler
 eulerscheZahl: RIP
 reCurse: RIP
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: not gonna edit that, I don't care anymore
 MSmits: just leave it for a bit, you'll come back to it later when disappointment is not so fresh
 eulerscheZahl: those were my boss names:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e70bb7f2-6575-4a6d-90a8-5a2bd489ef86">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e70bb7f2-6575-4a6d-90a8-5a2bd489ef86</a>
 eulerscheZahl: disappointment. that's a good tag for the game
 kovi: maybe we should try to add focus to the community contests. vote and chose one per 1-2 month?
 MSmits: been done, it does work somewhat, but there are problems
 MSmits: mostly that some players already have a bot
 MSmits: euler, do you want to talk about the game or&#160;?
 MSmits: I do have some questions
 jacek: i think hes not in the mood
 jrke: lot of debug info work 
 jrke: nice
 MSmits: yeah thats what i was wondering
 struct: MSmits I know most of the rules
 MSmits: it looks like a great game eulerscheZahl, if you want any support from me I'll gladly give it, but I can't take away the disappointment&#160;:(
 JBM: was it about fog of war?
 jrke: JBM you are getting every input so no fog of war i think
 eulerscheZahl: published as WIP now. thanks for suggesting that tag
 reCurse: 5% tag
 kovi:&#160;:)
 MSmits: struct i was only wondering if the x, y coordinates have any effect on the game besides forming the graph
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you can add new paths
 MSmits: ohh ok
 eulerscheZahl: but only if dist &lt;= 400
 eulerscheZahl: the graph is sparse on purpose
 MSmits: I see
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to create new triangles to increase your score gain and ability for fast spawning
 MSmits: this happens in higher leagues I guess?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: ah ok, so it's not my fault for reading badly 
 eulerscheZahl: it's your fault for not switching leagues
 eulerscheZahl: btw there's a debug mode in case you missed it
 MSmits: ohh
 eulerscheZahl: less fancy but easier for writing bots
 MSmits: I am pretty new to using contributions, didnt even know there was a league switdh
 MSmits: makes sense ofc
 eulerscheZahl: and you can draw your own stuff, like random circles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763769786663567360/798562647405625344/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763769786663567360/798562647405625344/unknown.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there's a toggle to show/hide them
 MSmits: pretty advanced stuff
 eulerscheZahl: i had some "fun" with JS
 reCurse: Looks really cool tbh
 PolarBear4u: UwU
 reCurse: I know it's not much of a consolation
 eulerscheZahl: i kinda saw it coming
 reCurse: Probably going to scrap my halfdone game too
 eulerscheZahl: asked Thibaud in August
 MSmits: well you're already, at least in my view, the top creator on CG
 eulerscheZahl: when they forget about your request for a while, that's rarely a good sign
 MSmits: reCurse this is not chess you're talking about I guess?
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: you have a different one?
 eulerscheZahl: he has something else in the making
 MSmits: ah
 reCurse: But yeah fuck it
 jrke: no cost for spawning?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 eulerscheZahl: only for attacking and paths changes
 eulerscheZahl: invest 3 units to get a new one :D
 MSmits: btw reCurse i do believe the 5% number, I just dont think it reflects the important of this group properly
 MSmits: they are far more active in many ways
 MSmits: importance
 eulerscheZahl: and keep the community alive even outside of those contests
 MSmits: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: find and report obscure bugs
 JBM: get ignored for it
 MSmits: this is actually the 0,5% probably, the ones that stick around between contests
 Nerchio: if it wasn't for you guys it would be just clash invites in this chat
 MSmits: the other 4.5% reappear on the next contest
 reCurse: 5% is such a terrible perspective on things
 reCurse: It says a lot
 reCurse: It says too much in fact
 MSmits: its just hard to even calculate such a percentage. Who do you add into the total? The person that just completed two puzzles?
 Gabbek: Hello once again, let me read the conversation a bit. *afk*
 eulerscheZahl: there was a poll after the last contests
 MSmits: oh is that where they got it
 reCurse: Because that's the way to look at things
 reCurse: Poll results
 JBM: so it was already biased in favor of competitors
 eulerscheZahl: where I clicked that I didn't care about streamers or company leaderboards
 MSmits: the wording matters though
 reCurse: All about those visits numbers
 reCurse: Who cares about quality or what people bring
 reCurse: They're just a minority
 reCurse: Vocal minority so safe to ignore
 MSmits: mmh that a bit cynical even though there's a grain of truth to that I think
 eulerscheZahl: if we could just ignore the conspiracy idiots instead
 kovi: depends on what is the goal (business)
 MSmits: reCurse and i had a whole argument about the degree to which quality matters. This touches that discussion i guess
 MSmits: let's not repeat it though&#160;:)
 JBM: they settled  the quality vs quantity debate when they opened the questmap
 MSmits: how so
 JBM: 120 puzles in the queue
 eulerscheZahl: ++
 kovi: i see this tendency in many gamer communities (last: battleground reset in hearthstone)...
 jrke: i got the rules but didn't get how to start for tryangle catch lol
 MSmits: ohh i know what you mean now JBM
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud is a passionate heartstone player, now i understand it
 MSmits: i dont think that was an intended sideeffect though
 MSmits: the huge contribution queue
 eulerscheZahl: it was to be expected
 MSmits: sure
 JBM: lazyness wins
 eulerscheZahl: see hacktoberfest
 JBM: yeah that was kind of a trainwreck this year
 JBM: probably the latest years rising
 eulerscheZahl: like a school class here on chat
 eulerscheZahl: but lasting for a full month
 kovi: but in cg community contribution/content (which also comes from 5%) is way more than building community in games
 JBM: the road to hell
 eulerscheZahl: so the 5% have this section where they can contribution multiplayer games. and please stay there
 eulerscheZahl: contribute*
 jrke: i am thinking to make a website for now which can create a new contest just by filling a single form why consisit of info like duration of contest starting and ending date multi name is it original content or not etc etc...
 MSmits: well it's not the exact same group of course, the 5% competitors and the creators
 jrke: which instead of why*
 MSmits: they have overlap
 eulerscheZahl: you need an original game for a contest
 MSmits: for a traditional and fair contest yes
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise it's not remotely the same at least for me
 jrke: no for community contests i am talking for
 struct: Well from those 5% you are lucky if 25% join your game
 struct: From what I understood they said 500 player for bronze
 eulerscheZahl: sorry but I refuse to call events like Winter Throne a contest
 MSmits: jrke I think the main problem is visibility
 struct: how many comunity games have 500 players?
 struct: 0?
 MSmits: i think there could be one or two, not sure
 jrke: hmm 
 Gabbek: 0 I think
 eulerscheZahl: dots and boxes has the most I think
 jrke: max is 327 for dots and boxes
 eulerscheZahl: 327
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium at 302. and online for almost 2 years
 JBM: what's winter throne?
 MSmits: these are submitted bots ofc
 eulerscheZahl: promoting the "Code of ice and fire" game
 MSmits: for the contest numbers, are we only counting submitted bots?
 eulerscheZahl: in a contest-like format with a filtered leaderboard
 JBM: ah, missed that, thx
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't missed much imo
 struct: Well CG seems to count the players that registered
 jrke: winter throne was unofficial community contest by me
 struct: Instead of the ones that actually played
 Nerchio: come on it was fun :D
 kovi: oh, so it is not the 2/year big contest they afraid?they want those minicontests to not overshadowed by other?
 eulerscheZahl: i had a strong bot before. so for me there was absolutely no point in playing
 MSmits: I wonder if you only count players that submitted a serious bot, say 200+ lines for a multi and compare that with those who did on a contest, if it is still a factor of 50
 Nerchio: yeah obviously in terms of community contests we are talking about new contributions
 eulerscheZahl: yes, not canibalize the big ones
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, some of your games I spent 20x as much time on than you did creating them. Do I then count as at least 20 participants?
 eulerscheZahl: nope :P
 MSmits: bah :P
 eulerscheZahl: but for tryangle catch that would mean a lot of effort for you, better start coding already
 jrke: the most i spended on any community game is D&amp;B and the next which comes is othello
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, I read the question wrong
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that counts extra
 MSmits: yeah I will do that, but not right now, that;s a difficult game, as it should be for a contest
 eulerscheZahl: for a community contribution it might even be a curse
 MSmits: I did a corona test today btw, I am 99% sure it is nothing
 MSmits: just to be safe i had to stay home from work
 jrke: have to for slep gn
 jacek: you failed the test?
 eulerscheZahl: keep players busy for a week. but outside of contests few are willing to tackle such a complex thing
 MSmits: 24-48 hr wait jacek
 MSmits: no idea if i failed 
 eulerscheZahl: so: mouth or nose?
 eulerscheZahl: where to inject the tube in a smits?
 MSmits: I have had 2 days of some fluid water/slime in my airways, not much but just enough to wonder. And some tiredness
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: both
 eulerscheZahl: wow
 MSmits: its not a tube
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't get testing. but even thinking about the nose part :scream:
 MSmits: stick with soft stuff dunno what it is
 MSmits: a swab, thats it
 eulerscheZahl: didn't know the English word and was too lazy to look it up
 eulerscheZahl: thus tube
 MSmits: well it was nothing, i think i inadvertently made the test easier
 MSmits: i woke up 10 mins before the test
 MSmits: had to put on clothes and raced to the test-street
 MSmits: i think when you cycle that fast your air ways are really open
 MSmits: so the thing went in my nose easily
 eulerscheZahl: lucky you
 MSmits: yeah, but its not exactly fun to  oversleep on your corona test :P
 eulerscheZahl: you still arrived on time, didn't you?
 MSmits: a few minutes late but there was a long line of cars, they didnt care really
 MSmits: i think the appointment is just to limit the total number of people
 SPDene: eulerscheZahl probably "cotton bud"  in british english; "q-tip" in american
 MSmits: ah yeah q-tip
 eulerscheZahl: i still remember Trump showing it and explaining how similar it is to that ear cleaning thing
 kovi: euler: you are right about heavy involvment/motivation on 1-2 week contest
 MSmits: yeah just longer and thinner
 Astrobytes: It's a swab test.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q6gW6lOSMY&amp;ab_channel=BreitbartNews">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q6gW6lOSMY&amp;ab_channel=BreitbartNews</a>
 Astrobytes: Nasopharyngeal to be precise
 MSmits: nice to see you're learning new things from Trump euler :P
 JBM: taking health tips
 eulerscheZahl: it rarely happens. I learn more here on chat
 eulerscheZahl: but i like the beginner level of English, easy to follow :imp:
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: much word repetition
 eulerscheZahl: great job
 JBM: in case you failed to parse the first utterance
 MSmits: thats actually a super rare video by Trump thats quite good
 eulerscheZahl: listen and repeat
 MSmits: i guess there's the off chance a total madman might say something useful every once in a while :P
 eulerscheZahl: infinite monkey theorem
 MSmits: that yeah
 Astrobytes: I feel infinite Donalds would still fail.
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: Also, euler: "Queen Elisaboss II" - stroke of genius right there.
 eulerscheZahl: maybe if we don't expect a whole Shakespeare novel but limit it to the length of a twitter message? 
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, I got creative on the boss names :D
 Astrobytes: The tags... "Disappointment, 5%"
 reCurse: Gotta keep the memes up
 jacek: 5%?
 Gabbek: Gotta love the "Member of the 5%", good job :p
 reCurse:&#160;:)
 reCurse: jacek: Competitive aspect is only 5% of people so there's zero priority into it
 eulerscheZahl: when this is an acceptable tag: 💦💦💦🔥🔥🔥
 eulerscheZahl: then I don't see any reason against mine
 reCurse: Has to promote learning and social and things that make numbers look bigger
 jacek: but im antisocial&#160;:/
 reCurse: Who cares about those hardcore guys anyway, there's so few of them
 JBM: who cares about the niche language ppl not getting any solution upvotes, there's so few of them
 reCurse: Different topic but ok
 JBM: hey i got minority complaints of my own ok
 reCurse: Sure
 TBali: for this 5% stuff. What is 100%? The 2million CG signups they have?
 VizGhar: I'm not finished with official puzzles yet, so I agree with not pushing competitions... but in 6-7 months I'll be striving for more competitions :P
 reCurse: It's just different as in we know that something works but won't because it's not focused
 JBM: the xp loot part did get a laugh out of me
 TBali: half of this 2million does not even pass onboarding
 eulerscheZahl: i think 100% = all contest participants
 reCurse: As opposed to something that doesn't work as well because there's no people to begin wtih
 BlaiseEbuth: There's 50% smurfs in the 100%
 TBali: contest participants - that is 10k people
 reCurse: Look at these numbers, look at them
 Astrobytes: I'm not gonna say anything for now, my mouth gets me in trouble a lot.
 reCurse: I'm way past that
 reCurse: Current plan is to win the lottery and create a platform, more likely to succeed
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: with blackjack and hookers
 Gabbek: Guess I'll try not to give up and atleast finish my CotR project so you can play few games against your bot euler&#160;:) regarding 5%... that's the sad reality of how stuff operates&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and then use another framework than pixi
 JBM: pixi sucking seems to be a purely cg problem though
 eulerscheZahl: i had some problems with it too
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote that static website to play Number Shifting on
 JBM: i've seen it used in quite a few places now i've got my eyes opened, and my CPU doesn't go near CG levels
 Astrobytes: you did NS with that right
 reCurse: At least free up more resources to pixi by nuking angular
 eulerscheZahl: pretty straight forward, no bells ans whistles
 Astrobytes: And it hogs memory after a wee while
 eulerscheZahl: massive GPU hit even when you have a static content and no animations
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'll move my game from WIP to ready tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: then it can get garbage collected on Valentine's day
 eulerscheZahl: (30 day autoremove)
 reCurse: Not sure I understand
 JBM: never holding that long
 TBali: it will get approved in to time with  no comment quest approvers
 reCurse: It will get approved
 eulerscheZahl: blockout is in the 2nd run already
 TBali: shall I reject just to keep the balance?&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: lol, not wrong TBali
 JBM: at least coordinate with your betatesters to get them to approve
 JBM: once the first notification shoots it's very fast
 eulerscheZahl: then i'll keep it WIP for a bit longer. no need to rush. there hasn't been that much of review yet (mostly statement, visuals, no gameplay)
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote some unit tests to cover corner cases
 reCurse: Anyway meetings over, I'm overdue for a walk, bbl
 Astrobytes: laters
 eulerscheZahl: i'm hungry, see you
 JBM: lucky you who're still allowed that
 reCurse: Before 8pm still can :D
 Gabbek: have a good one
 eyev: hi kyle&#160;:)
 JBM: hi brad
 VizGhar: those tags
 JJplayz: guys im doing coders strike back but i get an error at else on line 17

 jacek: what error
 jacek: what language is that? o.O
 Salted: I was thinking it was javascript till I say the then after if
 Salted: saw*
 KMC: hi @eyev
 KMC: hi jdawg

 TBali: sticky keys, eh?
 eulerscheZahl: it has already been dealt with&#160;;)
 TBali: So CG has aid for disabilies? Very thoughtful
 TBali:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no, we make sure they are left alone and can't call for help anymore
 Astrobytes: Ooof :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah&#160;! Darwinism on #world&#160;!
 zhoubou: Why is this code outputting wrong coordinates?
 zhoubou: def distance_sq(x1, y1, x2, y2): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d534bfba-3444-405f-94bc-072c2d7df97f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d534bfba-3444-405f-94bc-072c2d7df97f</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: If you know that the result should be (0, 50), mutliply your function result by 2.
 BlaiseEbuth: #beSmart
 zhoubou: But if I doprint(translate(0, 0, 0, 200, 50**2))then I get(0, 12)
 zhoubou: Then, multiplying by 2 wouldn't work&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: But I confirm your first degree works perfectly. :smirk:
 zhoubou: My first degree?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... Not sure of the expression in english...
 BlaiseEbuth: NVM. That was a joke.
 BlaiseEbuth: the *2
 zhoubou: Oh. I fell for it didn't I
 AnalPainGiver: lol
 zhoubou: Yes! I got over 40k on Code vs Zombies. Finally!
 AnalPainGiver: lol
 AnalPainGiver: that's nice, zh
 zhoubou:&#160;:)

 Salted: That's up there
 Edi007: Hey
 Edi007: How are you guys
 JBM: by birth
 Edi007: Dude, can you what is the best approach to solve this puzzles, I am struggling so much
 Edi007: There is so much information at once, it is so overwehlming for begginers
 JBM: yeah probably
 JBM: start simple
 Edi007: Yes, but the simplest is still difficult
 Edi007: They do note provide explanations or better ways
 Edi007: It is like an easy task category with a lot of description and information, that is just too overwehlming, instead of doing really simple stuff just to get the hang of it
 Edi007: Anyone any ideas
 Heiwu: Hi, also a noob here.
 Edi007: Hey man, do you have the same problem, feeling overwhelmed and not understanding the assignments, like too much info at once
 AI_says_hi: Edi what puzzle are you trying?
 Edi007: Well, the easiest one, easy for them apparently
 Heiwu: what took me some time to figure out: The puzzles follow always the same scheme: You get your inputs, you have to compute whatever that particular puzzle wants from you, then to must print (not return) your result(s).
 Edi007: There are too much blocks all around, too much explanations and you get lost so quick
 AI_says_hi: Which one exactly? Maybe I can help clear it up...&#160;:)
 jananski: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eac1ea97-56b7-4588-9bf8-cd939fa35e80">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eac1ea97-56b7-4588-9bf8-cd939fa35e80</a>
 Heiwu: example code shows how to get your input but normally doesn't store it for later calculations , so normally that's your first task.
 Edi007: Well he proposed me the descent excersise
 Edi007: Like you should something in the middle of the code
 Edi007: They do not see the problem from a beginers perspective
 jananski: try to edit your code according to test case by test case. like this you can break the bi problem into smaller problems
 jananski: big*
 Heiwu: the descent is really easy once you understand what they want from you.
 Heiwu: which lang do u code?
 Edi007: C#
 Edi007: I know that these can't hard, but their explanation is complicated
 jananski: i had the same problem with the explication of this puzzle 
 Edi007: for example in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://edabit.com/">https://edabit.com/</a> you have an excellent explanation, is you easy know what they want from you
 Heiwu: yeah, i know. it took me some time to realize how the questions are meant.
 Edi007: Yeah, I also searched for some youtube videos to explain that but not successfull
 Edi007: Yeah, that's what I mean
 Edi007: Maybe I need some time too?
 jananski: don't worry, you'll get used to their style of explaining their tasks
 Edi007: I hope so, but they should've started with something really easy, like hello world, then string concatination and so on, until we know how their method works, and then you can go to more harder problems
 jananski: and if you get stuck: on the left side you can click on "hints"
 Heiwu: what helped me is looking (trying to solve) other puzzles.
 Edi007: Yes I saw that, but they didn't provide any examples, they just explain in theory, but do not provide an example to get the hack of it
 AI_says_hi: Edi the descent puzzle has Community success rate: 54%. This means it is not _that_ easy. Maybe try a puzzle that has a higher success rate
 Heiwu: i even began doing "coders strike back".
 Edi007: Aha, why have they sorted on as easy task then
 jananski: because the principle is easy
 AI_says_hi: It is in the category easy, but there is still differences&#160;:)
 Edi007: Yeah, they should've made another category very easy, just like they made very hard
 Edi007: Where it is for real beginners
 Heiwu: gimme 1 min, i'll add comments and paste my (python) code...
 jananski: did you already train yourself a bit on the syntax of your used language?
 Edi007: yeah, I do some challenges on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://edabit.com/">https://edabit.com/</a> I love it
 Edi007: It is so powerful and yet their explanation is great
 Edi007: And if you can't solve a hard problem, then it is really that you still can't solve it, but you understand what they need from you
 Edi007: But the problem here is that you don't understand quite the problem, and are jumped in the middle of the console to give a solution
 jananski: i mean, if you understand what's happening in the template, you also have the learning-level to resolve the puzzle
 Edi007: I just need maybe some time to get used to
 jananski: i think so. and try another puzzle, the explanation is really a bit weird for this one&#160;:)
 Edi007: Yeah, glad that I'm not the only one that has this problem
 Edi007: Maybe the developers of codingame should think twice for this issue
 Edi007: and come up with something simpler for beginners
 Heiwu: this is my python code for the descent. surely not the best but works: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5a4ad5f-e492-4a0a-b2bc-3b314acb6fa4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5a4ad5f-e492-4a0a-b2bc-3b314acb6fa4</a>
 AI_says_hi: Last but not least in all programming you need perseverance and stubbornness to succees&#160;;-)
 AI_says_hi: succeed*
 Edi007: That's correct
 Heiwu: yeah. you can only fail if you give up&#160;;)
 jananski: the problem is really not in the puzzle itsel but in the task explanation. please try other puzzles before you form your opinion&#160;:)
 Edi007: Ok man I'll try
 jananski: good luck!
 Edi007: Thanks
 McOscar: war
 cengturkey: who want to play clash of code&#160;?
 fishforfeet: anyone do the birds on a wire CoC
 fishforfeet: need some help on how people are arriving at the formula
 fishforfeet: i got the correct output but i used string based solution

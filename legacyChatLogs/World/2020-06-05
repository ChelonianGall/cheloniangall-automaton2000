 jistjoalal: ruby is a lot like python
 jistjoalal: just learn it
 hydroglicerol: wow thats nice
 hydroglicerol: just learn it
 hydroglicerol: they say
 hydroglicerol: and then 2 years of frustration later "I think I got it"
 jistjoalal: there are literally programs which can be written the exact same in both languages
 hydroglicerol: probably its still a different language though
 hydroglicerol: and something this guy dosnt know
 jistjoalal: i learned ruby by glancing at docs while in clash of codes and consistently use it to win shortest mode
 jistjoalal: i dont write ruby anywhere else
 jistjoalal: its really not that hard
 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: whats the purpose if you learn a language just for a game
 jistjoalal: because it takes very little effort for a huge advantage because suckers like you think its too hard
 hydroglicerol: hey I dont even know python man just java and that alone I probably know about the main 75%
 hydroglicerol: there is still a lot more
 jistjoalal: yeah but thats enough to get started
 hydroglicerol: every program has therre little hidden secrets
 hydroglicerol: true
 jistjoalal: and you find them by using the language
 hydroglicerol: thats why I did
 hydroglicerol: not always true hard disagree
 hydroglicerol: somtimes you get flusterd enough brcause you dont know somthing you fell like quiting
 hydroglicerol: but othertimes you are rite
 jistjoalal: there are no consequences or time limits to learning to program
 jistjoalal: you can take as long as you want as fail as much as you need and nothing bad will happen to you
 jistjoalal: its like a video game
 hydroglicerol: that is somthing an unemployed man living in his mothers house would say
 hydroglicerol: are you seriouse
 hydroglicerol: of course there are time restraints
 hydroglicerol: some people cant do it at all without spending all of there free time
 jistjoalal: Learning to program is not a necessity of life it is a luxury
 jistjoalal: getting paid to program is an even higher luxury
 jacek: no contest hype?
 WINWINWIN: Only when it starts jacek&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: 7.5 more minutes
 NoorFadiya: hi
 WINWINWIN: Marchete, looks like you dont have anything to do in thibpat`s contest&#160;:)
 NoorFadiya: I need an opinion if any of you can answer. How can we assess someone's programming skill in a fun way that can replace exam and test during this covid19 pandemics? I hope I am asking in the right place here. Thanks
 WINWINWIN: NoorFadiya, I would think that a theory paper is useless in these circumstances... So preferably translate that theory paper to a practical. ask questions that require knowledge of theory so that you can code them
 AntiSquid: so what game was picked?
 AntiSquid: oh PR2 :D
 cegprakash: PR2?
 cegprakash: Platinum Rift?
 thibpat: yes, the unofficial contest happens on Platinum Rift - Episode 2!
 leojean890: a topic without leagues, mass submits will create a mess :P:P
 Nerchio: AntiSquid you played pr2?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Nerchio: it seems similar to ghost in a cell
 Nerchio: and i would probably have to implement floyd warshall again xD
 Nerchio: oh all zones distances are given already nice
 Marchete: platinum rift 2?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: You going down 
 Illedan: :D
 Marchete: :S
 tobk: did not register yet; how does the contest work? is it just an excerpt from the leaderboard with just the registered players, but otherwise identical and using the CG IDE?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thibpat.now.sh/contest/unofficial-codingame-contest">https://thibpat.now.sh/contest/unofficial-codingame-contest</a>
 Nerchio: in this game links are only given for nearby hexes yeah?
 Marchete: I won't play
 Marchete: I mean
 Illedan: Your bot is still there for me to drop ^^
 Marchete: :D
 Uljahn: revisited it a week ago, time to revisit again&#160;:(
 Illedan: From 101-&gt; top 50 with a new IF. Guess I have to write some serious code later :P
 Marchete: powerful IF
 Illedan: *Powerfull Linq
 Marchete: IF (losing) !lose()
 darkhorse64: Yet Another Fog Of War Contest
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Much easier fog of war though
 darkhorse64: My bot is a CP of a very weak PR1 bot. Time to do something
 WINWINWIN: More fog of war :sob:
 AntiSquid: :D
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN ping thibpat about it :p
 Astrobytes: aw ffs
 AntiSquid: did you start already Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: I have some kind of something in PR2, at 1469th place. Guess I better improve it
 Astrobytes: fking FOW
 Astrobytes: Still, not that bad
 Shadai: is there a possibility to get no more invites of unkown people who are started to follow me, just to send me pauseless invites to clash of codes?
 AntiSquid: no
 Astrobytes: Not yet unfortunately
 Shadai: gnarrr kk, thx
 Illedan: Astrobytes, easy top 20 without fog of war I think :P
 AntiSquid: only way is to suffer, there's some settings to turn off the sound thouhg Shadai
 Illedan: (without handling it)
 Astrobytes: Nice
 AntiSquid: siman wins the progression and probably the overall rank too 
 AntiSquid: we know the winner, time to move on and let siman do his thing :p
 kalidilogan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12450374b6a0fae58fb5a8e116bde1a0569ca43">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12450374b6a0fae58fb5a8e116bde1a0569ca43</a>
 AntiSquid: kalidilogan is that a clash invite? @_@
 kalidilogan: yes bro
 AntiSquid: don't post that in this chat
 Shadai: why dont you just join a random one?^^
 leojean890: he's just trolling according to Shadal previous msg&#160;?;)
 leojean890: Shadai
 leojean890: The winner could still be Neumann because #7 but maybe siman yep;P
 AntiSquid: the contest was years ago because the competition got difficult to deal with, so probably top bots will rank much lower?
 AntiSquid: before *  instead of because
 Imsure1200q: lol codingame complaining something to me that is not my responsibility
 Imsure1200q: what shud i do
 AntiSquid: what do you mean
 Imsure1200q: complaining about libraries
 Imsure1200q: c++
 AntiSquid: use the ones available instead
 AntiSquid: nothing you can do really
 Imsure1200q: here is my libraries:

 Imsure1200q: whoops
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a> here the ones available 
 AntiSquid: Imsure1200q that's the standard stuff, what exactly is the issue there?
 Imsure1200q: idk its showing weird stuff but heres the log
 Imsure1200q: In file included from /usr/include/c++/9/bits/stl_algobase.h:71, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/63d419cc-3082-4967-8a3e-26efc6a32d29">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/63d419cc-3082-4967-8a3e-26efc6a32d29</a>
 AntiSquid: there's a bug in your bot
 Imsure1200q: but its only complaining lines 1 to 5?
 AntiSquid: read the text
 AntiSquid: usr/include/c++/9/bits/predefined_ops.h:241:17: note:   ‘std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;’ is not derived from ‘const std::unordered_multimap&lt;_Key1, _Tp1, _Hash1, _Pred1, _Alloc1&gt;’
 Imsure1200q: but i dont have any map in there
 AntiSquid: but you are doing something wrong
 AntiSquid: look at that piece of code
 AntiSquid: make sure the types of variables match
 Imsure1200q: my code doesnt even reach like 241
 Imsure1200q: *line
 Imsure1200q: and somehow it has smth to do with iostream
 RoboStac: paste your first five lines in here?
 Imsure1200q: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fd757064-50d4-40fa-bda1-a27c65824f27">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fd757064-50d4-40fa-bda1-a27c65824f27</a>
 Imsure1200q: if i rearrange my libs it still produces the same error just in a different arrangement
 WINWINWIN: maybe in this contest better to do bulk of the work offline and submit in the end?
 AntiSquid: lol, better post the area around line 241 ... maybe the function that contains line 241, you do wrong var comparison 
 AntiSquid: there's no offline game version for PR2 afaik,&#160;:/
 AggYz: shortened mode is unfair
 AggYz: short languages will wim
 AggYz: python: 22 print(int(input(),16))
 AggYz: lua: 30 print(int(input(),16))
 AggYz: java: 223
 AntiSquid: i agree you should boycott by not playing clash anymore
 AggYz: lmaoo
 AggYz: im lua
 AggYz: fastest mode best
 Imsure1200q: if you want win shortest mode then get the shortest langs
 AntiSquid: here's a contest if you wish to join AggYz <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thibpat.now.sh/contest/unofficial-codingame-contest">https://thibpat.now.sh/contest/unofficial-codingame-contest</a>
 AggYz: python, ruby or lua
 AggYz: are shorty
 Imsure1200q: anti the log doesnt give me info about where it is
 AggYz: the comp doent have lua
 Imsure1200q: the only answer.cpp lines it is giving is lines 1 to 5
 Imsure1200q: AggYz it has lua

 leojean890: AntiSquid did competitions get recently harder&#160;?
 Imsure1200q: haha compiler not treating me well
 Imsure1200q: no bugs in my code but still giving me errors
 Imsure1200q: very nice
 AggYz: why java so big
 AntiSquid: why would this give an error&#160;? copy(vec.begin(), vec.end(), arr);
 Xcalibre: is arr a vector or an array?
 AntiSquid: array
 MSmits: it's basically a pointer though
 Xcalibre: declared like 'type arr[size]' or array&lt;type, size&gt;?
 AntiSquid: second
 AntiSquid: on
 Xcalibre: i think u need to change 'arr' to arr.begin() in ur parameter
 AntiSquid: ok so copy doesn't like the array&lt;&gt; thingy eh&#160;?
 Xcalibre: it needs an iterator
 struct: it doesnt copy content I think
 struct: It will store the addresses
 MSmits: ohh nice, this unofficial platinum 2 competition
 Xcalibre: if it was a primitive array, arr would be a pointer
 MSmits: very cool
 Xcalibre: 'arr[2]' would be equivalent to '*(arr + 2)'
 MSmits: I should get a bot up. Not sure how to write bots for these games though
 MSmits: AntiSquid, share your wisdom
 AggYz: I love lua
 AggYz: lua best language for clashofcode
 AggYz: its super short
 AntiSquid: ok seems to have copied the values correctly Xcalibre
 AggYz: its like python 
 AntiSquid: thanks
 Xcalibre: no problem :D
 StormHammer: hi
 Hjax: man the map generation for plat rift 2 is something special 
 eulerscheZahl: it's a pool of about 10 maps
 eulerscheZahl: and then randomly distribution platinum on it
 Hjax: that explains a lot 
 Hjax: random spawns its seems too?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Hjax: that doesnt seem particularly fair lol
 eulerscheZahl: there is one map that literally spells codingame in the center if you have a close look
 eulerscheZahl: and PR2 at the top+bottom
 Hjax: amazing 
 ZarthaxX: what's up with this unofficial contest
 eulerscheZahl: the unfair random map has 2 games with positions swapped
 eulerscheZahl: it's just promoting an existing multiplayer
 ZarthaxX: to give some motivation to play multis?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we get leagues?
 Hjax: thibpat organized it ZarthaxX, we are doing a 10 day "contest" in PR2
 Hjax: just for fun 
 Illedan: Hopefully leagues :pray:
 ZarthaxX: okey, tried to say that but im super lagged
 ZarthaxX: i saw yes Hjax ty
 ZarthaxX: Illedan haha
 Hjax: lol it would be nice if they opened leagues
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: there are only 2 games without leagues: PR2 and back to the code
 Hjax: i didnt even realize there were multis without leagues 
 Hjax: besides the really small ones 
 eulerscheZahl: and at some point there was a bug only affecting these 2 games without leagues. i wonder why they don't just add leagues
 ZarthaxX: aight have fun guys
 eulerscheZahl: considering the bug that would allow them to get rid of some code in the backend
 Hjax: maybe this was thibpats master plan
 Hjax: host a contest to get leagues for old multis :P 
 MSmits: hi guys
 Illedan: Hi
 Hjax: hi smits
 Illedan: My only goal is to drop Marchete :evil:
 MSmits: worthy goal
 Hjax: im kind of surpised how high my couple lines of python submission has climbed 
 MSmits: the quality of bots in older multi's is lower i think
 Illedan: Yeah
 MSmits: even in the short time i have been on CG (somewhat over 2 yrs) the competition got harder
 Hjax: yeah that certainly seems to be the case
 Hjax: my bot just makes random legal moves with a bias towards taking new territory 
 Hjax: and its rank 600 
 MSmits: well thats normal  i think
 MSmits: a game like this is hard to use a search for
 MSmits: so smart heuristics will help you a lot
 Hjax: i havent read any postmortems yet 
 Hjax: i suspect the top bots are using simulated annealing 
 MSmits: probably some optimization algorithms in there
 Illedan: nah
 MSmits: yeah like SA and GA
 Illedan: Beam search should be enough
 Hjax: this game looks pretty good for SA though 
 Illedan: On the bigger map you have soo many units
 MSmits: The scoring is the hard part
 MSmits: what to favor
 Illedan: All out on attack!
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 Hjax: i wonder if the simple rush bot is better than my rng bot 
 MSmits: I am having trouble disconnecting from uttt :P
 Hjax: just walk your first 10 dudes to the enemies spawn
 Illedan: Someone else submitted in uttt smitty?
 MSmits: nah, except karliso a few weeks ago
 MSmits: i'm nr 2
 Illedan: So bad
 Illedan: Fix it
 MSmits: I have a bot that beats his p2 100%, but I kinda want to finally know whether this game is solved as a draw or as a win for p1
 Hjax: if aliens ever come to earth and challenge us to a battle of UTTT, im glad that we will be prepared 
 MSmits: lol
 Illedan: Are you close to solving uttt?
 MSmits: well, I seem to be able to solve any path i find as a win for p1, if it is deep enough
 MSmits: but i cant solve the whole game
 MSmits: so if I lost a game as p1, i can backtrack to  a point, find my mistake, correct it and solve it as a win from there
 MSmits: for any situation i encountered so far
 MSmits: but I am trying to find a sure draw for p2.... no luck there
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/471108781">https://www.codingame.com/replay/471108781</a>Should be solvable
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: that awesome map. i remember i had one like that as well long ago
 eulerscheZahl: never found it again :D
 Nerchio: btw
 Nerchio: it blows my mind how unequal spawns can be in this game
 Hjax: me too Nerchio
 Nerchio: platinum rift 2 i mean
 Illedan: Those maps gets swapped matches
 Nerchio: oh so if i get a match like this im sure to get another one like that on the opposite side?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: And the sum of those 2 games makes the result
 Nerchio: that makes more sense then :P
 eulerscheZahl: yet what's the point of getting my ass kicked and then doing the same in return? :P
 Nerchio: yea im not sure how i feel about this certain maps are almost sure to be 1-1 then
 Illedan: Yeah..
 Illedan: For that 2 zone map I just shared I even got double matches..
 Hjax: Illedan your bot is so aggro
 Illedan: hm?
 Illedan: Pay to win&#160;;)
 Illedan: Hardcoded IF. if closer than some threshold =&gt; CHARGE
 Hjax: ah i see 
 Hjax: i got lucky and won one of them 
 eulerscheZahl: your bot definitely isn't that goal oriented yet Hjax
 Hjax: no im just praying to the random number generator to come up with good moves :D 
 Hjax: in theory my bot can beat recurse
 Hjax: i just need to be really lucky 
 Hjax: :P
 Illedan: My charge code beats him on smaller maps :P
 Hjax: nice 
 eulerscheZahl: on an asymmetric map i can beat him easily
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471171584">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471171584</a>is this a small map?
 Hjax: after a bunch of game spamming, my bot beat him on a tiny map 
 Illedan: Nice, print it and frame it
 Hjax: with the worst possible spawns for him 
 Hjax: man thats actually painful 
 Nerchio: i like the debug mode for this game though
 Nerchio: you can set fog of war for the player you want
 Illedan: The zoom is anoying
 Nerchio: yeah zoom is not needed 
 eulerscheZahl: zoom in to see cell IDs
 Illedan: Wow:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471173232">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471173232</a>
 Illedan: Clearly I have bugs -.-
 Nerchio: haha
 Nerchio: rekt :P
 Illedan: Platinum &gt; winning
 Hjax: oof
 Hjax: that was tragic
 reCurse: Please don't make me revisit :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: exactly my thoughts
 reCurse: I'm trying to finish my multi -_-
 Illedan: Finish?
 Nerchio: you are first what is there to revisit :P
 Illedan: Is there such thing?
 reCurse: Ok, progress
 reCurse: whatever
 eulerscheZahl: creating his own game
 MSmits: nice to see your agresssive strategy is working Illedan&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so there is a "finish"
 reCurse: Nerchio: for now
 Hjax: yeah theres a small army of people trying to remove his bot from 1st 
 MSmits: reCurse I like that you're making a game. Did you share anything yet?
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: Except that it will be underwhelming to 99%
 MSmits: ok. I will for sure make a bot for it
 reCurse: And I don't care
 eulerscheZahl: he only shared thought about the technology. SDK vs own JS code
 MSmits: underwhelming visually or game mechanics?
 reCurse: Underwhelming in terms of everything
 MSmits: hmm ok, i dont care visually really
 eulerscheZahl: we expect nothing less than the greatest CG game ever
 MSmits: though its a nice plus. Onitama looked great, but i stuck with it for the mechanics
 reCurse: I ripped graphics for now
 reCurse: May not care to replace them after
 MSmits: hmm but why are you making a game then? Just for your own enjoyment?
 reCurse: Sure
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: always a good motivation
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: reCurse is the new struct
 reCurse: What did I do&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: only when he deletes the account
 MSmits: it's a compliment though, as a game maker, struct is great
 MSmits: behaviorally maybe a bit wonky&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I prefer when he delivers
 Hjax: if recurse deleted his account i think the world would explode 
 wlesavo: rm -r account
 eulerscheZahl: -rf
 Hjax: it would be like when the left-pad guy pulled his code from npm 
 Illedan: lol
 MSmits: I'm missing that reference
 Illedan: google it
 MSmits: k
 reCurse: npm is everything that's wrong in software engineering
 Hjax: its a hilarious story, one guy single handed broke the internet for a day
 Hjax: by pulling his own open source library from npm
 Hjax: a very simple, tiny, left padding library 
 Hjax: and everything that depended on it, including npm itself i believe, broke
 Astrobytes: Tiny dependency issue
 reCurse: When you have a whole damn package for a one-liner function you know someone's been smoking crack
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: funny
 Hjax: how long do we have to init in pr2?
 eulerscheZahl: 1s for every game
 eulerscheZahl: then it varies from 50ms to 150ms for later turns depending on the game
 Hjax: ah ok, the rules didnt mention it so i was concerned it was 100 ms 
 Hjax: wait, do we not know where the enemies spawn is 
 Hjax: oh 
 Hjax: i see, its just implemented weird 
 Csar00: hi
 Csar00: hfdgfdag
 Illedan: You must output the multiplication of the given elements per every element without including the index element.What does this even indicate -.-
 eulerscheZahl: are you clashing?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: I understand nothing of this thing :P
 Illedan: Who accepts these contributions -.-
 Hjax: uh, multiply everything in the list together except the element at the index provided to you
 Hjax: is how i read that 
 Hjax: but yeah its word salad 
 eulerscheZahl: apparently: karimalami7, NISEoffly, BVSTIEN
 eulerscheZahl: Example:Input 0 1 2 should output 2 0 0 = 1*2 0*2 0*1.
 eulerscheZahl: does not match your theory Hjax
 Illedan: Bad example
 Hjax: darn 
 Illedan: It does
 eulerscheZahl: oh, product of all divided by value at given index
 Hjax: oh the index isnt provided to you, you have to do what i said for every index 
 eulerscheZahl: 1 2 3 424 12 8 6
 Hjax: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: that makes it clearer
 eulerscheZahl: let's LINQ it
 Illedan: 807 chars shortest 
 Illedan: pff
 struct: 807?
 Illedan: 726 without some usings
 struct: My FB bot might have less chars than that
 eulerscheZahl: not golfing, just want to LINQ it now :D
 Illedan: Too tierd for shortest -.-
 Illedan: Hmm, can you do this on one line :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: damn, divide by 0&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl:         int[] nums = Console.ReadLine().Split().Select(int.Parse).ToArray();
 Illedan: Is there a Linq to multiply all&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, the aggregate part
 eulerscheZahl: nums.Aggregate((a,b) =&gt; a*b)
 Illedan: Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", items.Select(i =&gt; items.Where(k =&gt; k!=i).Aggregate((x,y) =&gt; x * y))));
 Illedan: 10 sec left and it worked :tada:
 Illedan: ty Hjax
 Hjax: lol np 
 Hjax: i think i should be #1 on the unofficial contest progression leaderboard in a few mins 
 Hjax: when it updates 
 Illedan: What rank are you now?
 eulerscheZahl: because you started low
 Hjax: 182
 Illedan: Nice
 Hjax: and yeah i hadnt submitted before 
 Hjax: so maximum improvement! 
 Illedan: Wonder if I didn't join the contest. Submitted a crashing bot =&gt; joined =&gt; submitted real bot
 Hjax: its just for fun anyway 
 Hjax: but i like this game, its the kind of game im decent at 
 Illedan: true
 Hjax: unlike pacman, pacman made me very sad 
 eulerscheZahl: i liked pacman. except for the fog part
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: fog killed it for me
 Hjax: fog is fine, but there was too much fog 
 Hjax: not being able to see around corners 
 Illedan: lol
 Hjax: was so frustrating 
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: Just a 4 depth BFS would make the game soo much better
 Illedan: In fog view
 Hjax: agreed 
 eulerscheZahl: for some reason CG loves fog
 Hjax: the last 3 contests have had large amounts of imperfect info 
 Hjax: UTG had the least, and i found it the most interesting 
 eulerscheZahl: it's fine when the whole game is about it (OoC)but pacman had enough depth without
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5f37f5ef-1e98-4487-85fa-2fee0a8360db">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5f37f5ef-1e98-4487-85fa-2fee0a8360db</a>
 Illedan: Is this where the fun ends&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: most useless fog IMO: the mines at coders of the caribbean
 eulerscheZahl: i have some tracking in my bot
 eulerscheZahl: checking where opponent could be, discarding region if i see an unvisited cell leading there, ..
 Illedan: Good thing they can't speed in PR2
 eulerscheZahl: if my platinum increases as expected, can't be on my platinum cells
 eulerscheZahl: map symmetry
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: Wish I could at least see my owned cells
 Alshock: well  Ithink that's a good point you don't, that's what makes a larger territory harder to protect
 eulerscheZahl: my biggest weakness: i can't concentrate on 2 parts of the map at once
 Illedan: Have a search?
 eulerscheZahl: if the map is ring-shaped, i always attack all on one side. then i win there and attack the other, losing my gained territory
 eulerscheZahl: no search
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: In 2+ articulation point maps
 eulerscheZahl: does BFS count as a search? it has search in the name
 Illedan: *sim
 eulerscheZahl: 2+ articulation point?
 Alshock: 2+ ways to the opponent's base
 eulerscheZahl: you mean as a ring? by definition that's not an articulation point then
 eulerscheZahl: it's a minimum cut
 Illedan: oh
 Illedan: k
 Illedan: my bad
 eulerscheZahl: now you have a keyword to put into google&#160;;)
 Illedan: :innocent:
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand you could just hardcode these points, as the amount of maps is limited
 Alshock: I was hoping for blood and gore, but even image search is flooded with graphs&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: or you go the toad way and don't care
 Illedan: I wont care
 Illedan: :D
 Alshock: "I don't feel any shaaame I won't apoooologiiize"
 eulerscheZahl: "I was hoping for blood and gore"
 WINWINWIN: Is cgstats bugged now?
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/platinum-rift-2/WINWINWIN">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/platinum-rift-2/WINWINWIN</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's because the leaderboard is bugged
 eulerscheZahl: joke aside: did you even read the red text?
 eulerscheZahl: or are you another ceg?
 Alshock: I can't find myself either, there is a real 404 I think
 WINWINWIN: I am in the top 1000 and I did not see magus on the chat
 struct: if you add one more letter to ceg it means blind in portuguese
 WINWINWIN: :LD
 eulerscheZahl: it's a MULTIPLAYER, not a contest
 eulerscheZahl: even if it's announced as one
 WINWINWIN: Ahh, tried again and it worked, sry euler&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's just a way to simulate the feeling of playing together like you do in a contest
 MSmits: i can see why it's better than everyone doing their own random multi
 eulerscheZahl: i just explained why the cgstats search wasn't working: he checked the contest leaderboard
 MSmits: it might even be better than a contest if enough join, because more ideas will be shared
 WINWINWIN: Is CG computing submits now?
 Hjax: my rank doesnt seem to be updating for my current submit if thats what you mean WINWINWIN
 jacek: all the power went to contest
 Hjax: something definitely broke lol 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/feature-request-ability-to-reject-incoming-follow/58429/9?u=eulerschezahl">https://forum.codingame.com/t/feature-request-ability-to-reject-incoming-follow/58429/9?u=eulerschezahl</a>\o/
 Hjax: i dont think ive seen a leaderboard just stop updating before 
 Hjax: and eulerscheZahl youll finally be able to update your status 
 Hjax: now it can say "try and invite me to clash of code, i dare you"
 eulerscheZahl: or i'll add nice quotes from other users about myself
 wlesavo: the question is will you be able to unfollow the old ones or only reject incoming follows
 Hjax: "eulerscheZahl is really good at clash of code, you should invite him" Hjax 2020
 WINWINWIN: The leaderboard coming up anytime soon?
 Astrobytes: "eulerscheZahl hijacks my thought processes" - Astrobytes, 2020
 Hjax: i have no idea what happened to the leaderboard 
 Hjax: we broke it i guess lol 
 wlesavo: i got the reference, but is there any particular ones you like euler?
 Nerchio: or euler downloaded 5000 replays again
 LelouchVC2: "When I was down on my luck, Euler came through and sucked my dry."
 Hjax: oh it just updated! 
 eulerscheZahl: now i don'T find the quote anymore&#160;:( was actually an insult :D
 wlesavo: i know, you should take some of last ceg quotes :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: The PM from that girl was a good one
 wlesavo: not-a-pebcac girl?
 Astrobytes: No no, one of the ones who wanted to buy a solution in the last(?) contest&#160;:)
 wlesavo: oh, it was a girl
 Hjax: well, the profile picture was a girl at least 
 Astrobytes: A real girl, yes.
 Nerchio: :astonished:
 Astrobytes: yeah Hjax
 wlesavo: mine was guy
 Hjax: she was NOT HAPPY about euler refusing to help her cheat 
 Astrobytes: Everyone else was thoroughly entertained&#160;:)
 Hjax: if we are running custom contests on old multis, it would be neat to implement some new rules
 LelouchVC2: Imagine being a girl on the internet
 Hjax: who can make the best bot in under 1000 characters or something 
 LelouchVC2: Finding them would be like finding a needle in someone's appendex
 WINWINWIN: I see that the LB is back
 WINWINWIN: sry to bother you at the CG team
 LelouchVC2: Our time is valuable
 LelouchVC2: Please refrain from taking up so much of it
 AggYz: guys what is the best language that covers most subjects
 LelouchVC2: There
 Hjax: theres no right answer to that question AggYz
 LelouchVC2: There's no "best" language. Other than C++
 AggYz: how about if i append for beginners to it
 Hjax: id say python 
 AggYz: how about lua
 Hjax: i dont know lua, so i cant pass judgement on it 
 LelouchVC2: But going from python as a first language to any meaningful language will feel like going from algebra to trig
 Hjax: python is meaningful 
 Hjax: its not a lesser language XD
 Hjax: its not the most performant thing in the world 
 AggYz: lua has like the same syntax as python
 Hjax: but its beginner friendly, and used a lot in the real world 
 AggYz: but doesnt relie on indentation
 LelouchVC2: Imagine being hired to code Python
 Hjax: google hires lots of people to code python 
 Hjax: its used a LOT in machine learning 
 LelouchVC2: Imagine being hired by Google to code their live pythons
 Nerchio: they are testing to see why anyone would code in python
 LelouchVC2: ^^^^^
 LelouchVC2: LMAO
 Hjax:&#160;? python is a fine language for what it is 
 Nerchio: jk ofc
 LelouchVC2: I suppose, 
 LelouchVC2: Just not friendly when moving on to another language
 LelouchVC2: And Python was your first
 Hjax: its great at string manipulation, it has fantastic libraries 
 LelouchVC2: Practically cheating on CoC where complex problems have a function dedicated to solving them
 tomatoes: lua too weird
 eulerscheZahl: not cheating, just a poorly designed clash
 AggYz: lua the only language i know
 AggYz: like python but less functions for literally everything
 LelouchVC2: *pats back* There's a world out there my friend
 Man_on_the_Moon: i cant say anything about any language 
 Man_on_the_Moon: i suck at anything
 LelouchVC2: Why? You only speak english?
 Man_on_the_Moon: yes
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 Nerchio: he can't speak because he is on the moon
 Nerchio: no connection
 LelouchVC2: ^
 Man_on_the_Moon: exactly
 Man_on_the_Moon: i got lucky this time
 bram1253: LELOUCH VI BRITANNIA
 AggYz: Java and Cpp developers when they get shortest mode:
 bram1253: python and bash are cheat codes for shortest mode lmao
 AggYz: python, lua and ruby developers when they get shortest mode:
 LelouchVC2: I, Lelouch Vi Britannia command you... now all of you.. DIE!
 bram1253: ay lelouch
 AggYz: I hate OOP
 bram1253: why do u bring C++ to a shortest challenge :p
 AggYz: functional better
 LelouchVC2: Because I still win them with C++
 jacek: why do you bring knife to a gun fight
 LelouchVC2: Because you can throw a knife
 LelouchVC2: And the gun has limited bullets
 AggYz: jacek lol
 Man_on_the_Moon: true

 hydroglicerol: nothing like a good xkcd
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid?
 hydroglicerol: does anyone else notice how biased against java LITERALLY everything here is
 BenjaminUrquhart: well
 BenjaminUrquhart: how so
 hydroglicerol: its as if there screaming F&amp;*^ you oracle
 hydroglicerol: java compared to python 3
 hydroglicerol: is ridiculous for length challenges
 BenjaminUrquhart: java is a relatively verbose language
 hydroglicerol: as well as speed
 BenjaminUrquhart: did you expect something else to happen
 hydroglicerol: I guess but it is a classic
 Hjax: java isnt intended to be used for code golf 
 BenjaminUrquhart: ^
 hydroglicerol: and its what you need to know for the college board AP
 BenjaminUrquhart: the problem here is you're playing clash of code
 jacek: kree java!
 BenjaminUrquhart: dab
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to create your own contributions, Java is a great choice
 Hjax: lol 
 hydroglicerol: well I already did the stuff Im capable of doing in practice
 hydroglicerol: + clash of code is fun
 BenjaminUrquhart: try multis
 hydroglicerol: its just biased
 BenjaminUrquhart: you haven't given a reason for bias other than it's not as short as python
 hydroglicerol: maybe I will but this is great practice it just takes longer is longer and is harder to do in java than most languages
 hydroglicerol: I feel like maybe there should be an auto matcher fo people who use the same language as you
 BenjaminUrquhart: I wouldn't say harder persay
 hydroglicerol: that would make it way  ore fair
 BenjaminUrquhart: well
 BenjaminUrquhart: here's the problem
 BenjaminUrquhart: F# exists
 hydroglicerol: the reason its biased is because most problems that Ive seen play to the strenghths of python literally every time
 AntiSquid: hydroglicerol the back end is all sorta java-ish, and the multi referees are in java
 hydroglicerol: true
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's because you're doing CoC
 AntiSquid: easy to use referee code for sim if you use java, def rigged towards java
 AntiSquid: making a CG game? ya rigged in favor of java
 AntiSquid: to hell with java grrrr
 eulerscheZahl: "I wouldn't say harder persay"who's persay?
 BenjaminUrquhart: good question
 hydroglicerol: never thought of that
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok there's 1.6k people on the PR2 leaderboard
 hydroglicerol: also that is one weird texture for a golden apple no?
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's exactly 1 F3 guy
 hydroglicerol: yikes
 BenjaminUrquhart: f#
 eulerscheZahl: but how many D?
 BenjaminUrquhart: 0
 hydroglicerol: where are the leader boards&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: they only exist for multis and optims
 BenjaminUrquhart: and contests
 hydroglicerol: aha
 BenjaminUrquhart: any other objections
 Nerchio: nobody in this chat plays clash of code but euler is always willing i think
 BenjaminUrquhart: always remember to invite euler
 hydroglicerol: yah while we are at it I feel like mars rover 2 is way harder than 3 
 BenjaminUrquhart: mars 3 is mars 2 but with a flipped map
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's all
 hydroglicerol: no it has caves and stuff its not just reversed actually I dont think any of the test cases are the reverse of 2
 eulerscheZahl: i solved marslander 3 before 2
 hydroglicerol: seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 hydroglicerol: I did the same
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh I messed it up, yeah they different :P
 structs_s_main: o hai
 Astrobytes: Also it's "per se" btw
 Nerchio: i solved marslander episode 1
 Nerchio:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i wanted to point out :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 hydroglicerol: well Im glad that had a happy ending
 GalvaBart: grats @Nerchio
 hydroglicerol: awww its kirby
 GalvaBart: haha
 GalvaBart: :D
 Nerchio: GalvaBart thanks, for?
 eulerscheZahI: let's play clash, didn't try it in a while
 Nerchio: ah marslander 1 yea that was tough
 Astrobytes: :o
 hydroglicerol: yknow the parasite that can eat in entire universe ... 
 hydroglicerol: how adorable
 hydroglicerol: *a
 eulerscheZahl: while True: print("0 3\n0 4")
 eulerscheZahl: that solves marslander 1
 GalvaBart: I've read that people solved marslander 2 with genetic algorithm. That sounds super interesting
 jacek: genetic eh
 hydroglicerol: it was extremely tedious I can see why somone let a robot do it for them
 Astrobytes: Use the power of GAimax
 GalvaBart: @eulerscheZahl I recognize that frog, was it from the Simpsons episode with Bart returning from Australia&#160;?

 WINWINWIN: jrke man, you were #440 in PR2 today... and you ask whats podsP0?

 Nerchio: AntiSquid i think its kind of a lot to ask them to add leagues to a 5 year old game :D
 Astrobytes: 2 Java bots in top 10
 hydroglicerol: dont worry it was a joke
 AntiSquid: they added leagues for the other old games nerchio
 Astrobytes: Didn't they say it wasn't possible? I could be mistaken
 hydroglicerol: does LOCM have a league is it like an actual gam to play somewher 
 hydroglicerol: *e *e
 Astrobytes: Everything in Bot Programming is an 'actual game'
 Astrobytes: All the previous official contests have proper leagues except PR2 and.... Back to the Code? PR1? Something like that.The community-made games only have Wood leauges
 Astrobytes: *or leagues
 eulerscheZahl: PR2 + BTTC it is
 eulerscheZahl: with best of 5 at the top of the leaderboard

 AntiSquid: i don't like clash
 Illedan: euler playing clash?
 Illedan: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: pipistrello, people will see it in the contributions page, no need to post here
 pipistrello: Astrobytes, ups! thanks for letting me know.
 Astrobytes: No worries pipistrello&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: and not sending invites either
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you invited me :rage:
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: soon it will be over
 Illedan: Can't I use innline functions in C#&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: that would be new to me
 Illedan: Thought it came with the update
 eulerscheZahl: c# has an inline keyword?
 eulerscheZahl: or do you mean declaring a function in a function?

 Illedan: Can't have that k
 eulerscheZahl: that parsing :D
 eulerscheZahl: Convert.ToInt(string, 16)
 Illedan: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: noob
 Illedan: hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: and you want to invite me to a clash
 Illedan: Yeah, maybe I learn something lol
 Illedan: I had toInt, but it didn't compile, went for the next option :P
 Illedan: Guess I had some other syntax error
 Illedan: I would never win vs 65 in JS anyway -.-
 eulerscheZahl: i knew that you like C#. but golfing with it feels like torture :D
 Illedan: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: choose the right tool for your problem
 Illedan: I want clash without shortest :P
 JBM: also without ruby
 Illedan: Just wait for the new C# eulerscheZahl :D
 hydroglicerol: whats wrong with shortest?
 Illedan: Without class and everything
 hydroglicerol: ruby I get
 eulerscheZahl: not gonna happen
 hydroglicerol: but whats wrong with shortest
 struct: Illedan just try ruby :D
 hydroglicerol: nope
 hydroglicerol: that for the devil himself
 eulerscheZahl: would break with a lot of concepts that C# stands for

 Illedan: \o/
 Illedan: Now let me have everything imported in my class hidden. And we can compete
 Astrobytes: "In C# 9.0 you can just choose to write your main program at the top level instead" - now *that* is cool
 Astrobytes: awww dammit, not you too
 Illedan: hm?
 Astrobytes: You beat me to it
 Csipcsirip: ahh finally
 Astrobytes: Like euler always does
 Illedan: beat me to what?
 Astrobytes: Stating the same thing
 eulerscheZahl: that init reminds me of "final" in Java
 Astrobytes: re. Top level C# programs
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes is a very well done echo bot
 Csipcsirip: uhh it looks ungly tho: Point p = new (3, 5);
 eulerscheZahl: took me a while to realize that he is not real
 Astrobytes: meh
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: i like the with keyword
 eulerscheZahl: but the code outside of the main...i'm too old and conservative for this
 Astrobytes: *too set in your ways you mean!
 eulerscheZahl: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: "we always did it like that"
 eulerscheZahl: "with logical operators and, or and not, spelled out as words"
 eulerscheZahl: i start to not recognize my favorite language anymore
 Astrobytes: New addition to your CV: C# (legacy only!)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't even caught up on the pattern matching for C#8
 Astrobytes: You'll have to change avatar to a hyno-dinosaur soon enough :P
 Astrobytes: *hypno
 eulerscheZahl: have to find one. my artist skills won't allow me to draw my own

 Astrobytes: My eyes
 Marchete: C# 9 is better for codegolf
 Astrobytes: Ahhh, get JBM to do one for you. It'll be awesome, guaranteed.
 eulerscheZahl: there is no hypno in that image
 eulerscheZahl: you'll have to redo all your golfing puzzles Marchete
 Hjax: the poor pr2 leaderboard is struggling 
 Illedan: What did you do now? :P
 Hjax: i did nothing, i just hit the submit button 
 Hjax: which is apparently too much for it 
 Astrobytes: How many new players are there since yesterday/this morning? (I'm lazy to check)
 Csipcsirip: if you zoom on his eyes you can find the hypno
 Illedan: 1646 now, how many was it?
 Astrobytes: That's what I'm asking :P
 Hjax: judging by the unofficial contest leaderboard about 20 entirely new people?
 Illedan: my guess too
 Hjax: but 160 that are signed up and havent submitted yet 
 Marchete: reCurs e join and win us all :D
 Hjax: got to remove him from rank 1 first 
 Hjax: he needs motivation 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: It's pretty cool having lots of people doing the same multi, certainly inspired me to submit something other than my previous WAIT bot anyway&#160;:)
 Illedan: Agreed
 Illedan: CG should make Multi of the month
 Illedan: with some stats on the front page
 Astrobytes: We've been saying that for ages
 Illedan: yeah..
 Hjax: it would be nice if the leaderboard updated D: 
 Illedan: shh
 Astrobytes: Maybe with the coming improvements they'll do it
 Astrobytes: But I'm all for community-organised stuff regardless
 JBM: somebody need mspics?
 Marchete: yeah, playing the same multi is nice
 Marchete: I remember some past ad-hoc competitions we had on some multis
 eulerscheZahl: what's mspics?
 Astrobytes: Think it's regarding my call for JBM to do your dinosaur avatar eulerscheZahl. MSPaint pics :P
 eulerscheZahl: but he's a linux guy and won't use paint
 Astrobytes: (he's got Windows too)
 Astrobytes: shh

 Hjax: pr2 leaderboard is so lazy
 Hjax: its been like an hour since its last updated itself 
 Astrobytes: Is it all LB's or just PR2 HJax? If you know that is
 YurkovAS: Leaderboard is broken, not working in other multi
 Hjax: i dont know, guess its all of them ^
 Astrobytes: Thanks YurkovAS
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: my work laptop's windows, I use mspaint occasionally to "improve" screenshots
 JBM: that latest win10 release is abismal
 Astrobytes: FWIW I've reported the LB issue on discord
 JBM: oh so discord's the canonical bugtracker now?
 JBM: hard to follow
 Astrobytes: *JBM abysmal
 JBM: thx
 Astrobytes: It's crazy not having a proper system for bug reporting, yeah
 JBM: and then getting berated for actually testing things before reporting them
 Astrobytes: Yes, I've noticed a few examples of that
 JBM: still taking my breathing time
 JBM: before compiling an all-factual list of how yes they're bad at handling it
 Astrobytes: With references and concrete examples ofc
 Astrobytes: You know this list will be far from finite right?&#160;:)
 YurkovAS: Leaderboard start working
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MostComplicatedUsername: Nice PR 2
 MostComplicatedUsername: Apparently there's a 10 day contest
 Astrobytes: Yes, join MCU
 Astrobytes: It's just an informal contest
 Neumann: Looks like I'll have to rewrite my whole PR2 code
 Neumann: Can't understand shit of what I wrote 3 years ago
 Astrobytes: But lots of people playing one multi is always good
 Astrobytes: lol Neumann

 Astrobytes: Is your submission working?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Just submitted
 MostComplicatedUsername: YEs

 Astrobytes: Anyone confirm leaderboard still not updating?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im on leaderboard now
 Astrobytes: MCU, battles are working but the leaderboard doesn't seem to be updating
 MostComplicatedUsername: Seems to be updating

 Astrobytes: MostComplicatedUsername you're stuck at 1.02 on leaderboard?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im still making my bot

 Astrobytes: No I mean your submission is stuck
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh
 Astrobytes: Confirm?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes
 MostComplicatedUsername: Still 1.02
 Astrobytes: Thx
 RedsTom: share your code
 Astrobytes: Are you talking about clashes RedsTom?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Automaton2000 is the chat dead?
 Automaton2000: but if you only do one thing
 MostComplicatedUsername: What do I have to do Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: it even has a tutorial
 MostComplicatedUsername: What has a tutorial Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: should i have a hard time
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes you should Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: actually i think it's a great selection
 MostComplicatedUsername: Nice pfp Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: should have been stuck in silver league
 AggYz: WHAT IS oop ACTUALLY GOOD FOR
 Hjax:&#160;?
 JBM: Selling books
 Astrobytes: Wanna buy one?
 Hjax: you must hate java then 
 JBM: Trainings too
 JBM: I certainly do
 Hjax: i like java, oop is fine
 JBM: You like Java, Java sucks, pop can be fine
 JBM: *oop
 Astrobytes: It's just another paradigm. Another tool in the box.
 Hjax: why does java suck?
 JBM: Good I didn't make the typo "poop"
 Astrobytes: Procedural OOP
 Astrobytes: :P
 JBM: Because it's pressure is below atmosphere's I'd say
 Astrobytes: heh
 JBM: That's the usual reason things aspire
 Playing: Java, C++, ...
 Astrobytes: Are we supposed to guess the next one, Playing?
 Astrobytes: Hm. Leaderboards gonna be broken until tomorrow methinks.
 jacek: you know what doesnt suck? vacuum cleaner made in java
 JBM: Saving that one for later, thx jacek&#160;:-D
 AggYz: n,t=tonumber(io.read()),0;next_token=string.gmatch(io.read(),"[^%s]+");for i=0,n-1 do a = tonumber(next_token());t=t+a^2;end;print(math.floor(t))
 AggYz: lua is the best shortest mode language
 Astrobytes: That one from jacek's gotta be one for TvC JBM
 JBM: Good idea
 JBM: If only I remembered it tomorrow
 Astrobytes: I'll remind you
 AggYz: does python kinda suck at shortest cuz of it depending on indentation?
 AggYz: or is it minifiiable
 Astrobytes: you can indent by 1 space, and some things can be on one line, use less verbose syntax etc
 Astrobytes: Not that I clash or anything but, facts
 Uljahn: i=input;a,b,c=i(),i(),i();print(a,b,c)&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ^ See AggYz? Always trust cats.
 AggYz: is that python or lua
 Uljahn: py3
 Astrobytes: Why would it be Lua in reference to shortening python code?
 Uljahn: it doesn't look like python i guess
 Astrobytes: Does to me. Too much CG maybe :P
 hydroglicerol: ummsorry to bother everyone but by COC you can see where you freinds are ranked there is a yellow number but there is also a number if you hover over that person what is the difference betwwen thos numbers?
 Uljahn: COC rank is a part of CP rank
 hydroglicerol: sorry what is CP
 Astrobytes: CodinPoints
 hydroglicerol: so the number I see when I hover over is tthe CP
 Astrobytes: Level is acquired through puzzles and moving up leagues in multiplayers
 hydroglicerol: gotcha ty
 Astrobytes: (and achievements)

 Alshock: FOR Hypersonic, if 3 bombs form an L and the first one exploding breaks a box and triggers the second bomb, that triggers the third, that bearks the same box as the first, both the first and the thrid get the box point. But if there are two stacked bombs, then the first one destroys the box, then triggers the second which does not get the box points unless it was coming off at that same turn?! What is the expected behaviour?
 Alshock: they both get the point replay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471257774">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/471257774</a>but not if they're stacked: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/471256962">https://www.codingame.com/replay/471256962</a>
 wlesavo: Alshock if think its actually a bug, since you cant place bomb on top of the other bomb when its done on the same turn only the first one placed even though technicaly it should be simultanious
 soloyolo97: I apologize, but could someone point me in the right direction to figure out Kirk's Quest? I know it's noob lvl, but I can't figure it out.
 Uljahn: looks like only one bomb was placed in the second replay
 wlesavo: usualy if you stay on bomb and try to place another one you would get an error which is not occured in this replay, but still only one was placed  
 wlesavo: maybe it was discussed during a contest
 dyc3: I'm having a problem with code a-la mode. Sometimes, after my chef serves an order, the next round doesn't read all 3 orders and it hangs

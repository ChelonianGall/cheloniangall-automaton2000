 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is always here
 Automaton2000: i don't think i can make a ga for csb
 thibpat: I'm live, trying to improve my AI for the Twixt-PP challenge <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 MadKnight: fix it Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: i wanted to have a huge bug
 Uljahn: do you eat bugs, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: if someone can help me with coders strike back
 LelouchVC2: I have 3 pickles in a jar
 LelouchVC2: And each pickle is racist
 DiL: any good resource (examples,etc...) on dynamic programming in python?
 HazelJoy: all python programming is dynamic though?
 LoGos: I think he is referring to dynamic programing in algorithms, not memory managment
 LoGos: is he?
 LelouchVC2: clash of code is literally everyone just using python for 3 line answers
 HazelJoy: you gotta win somehow
 TrentT: Is there something wrong with that?
 wlesavo: playing CoC wrong in general
 LelouchVC2: I'm coding in C++, can't possibly win
 wlesavo: but you definetly can win a contest by coding in C++, there you go
 LelouchVC2: IQ++
 MSmits: use the right tool for the job
 MSmits: c++ is much used on CG and so is python
 MSmits: don't hammer a nail using pliers
 LelouchVC2: What a coincidence that python happens to always be the right tool *rolls eyes*
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama/leaderboard</a>
 HazelJoy: it's the right tool for short code or fast code
 MSmits: really&#160;?
 HazelJoy: but not necesarily for all puzzle sand stuff
 wlesavo: MSmits nice
 LelouchVC2: I think I've been first place in one contest. Even if I finish first, python coders will end up with shorter code
 MSmits: why is that a problem LelouchVC2
 Uljahn: clashes are not contests
 MSmits: short code is not always the objective
 LelouchVC2: Once there was a very complex problem, and it took a good while to code it out
 LelouchVC2: The first place guy was done in less than a minute because there was a python function that apparently was created for that very problem..
 Uljahn: jeez
 MSmits: LelouchVC2 you do realize this website has more than just clashes? Most players dont clash here and the ones that do will not use c++ for the reasons you mentioned
 LelouchVC2: I suppose, I was just looking for a fun way to pass the time
 MSmits: make a bot
 MSmits: pick one of the near 50 arenas
 Uljahn: clashing in c++ could be fun too
 MSmits: c++ will be major advantage for winning, even though it will take you a bit more time
 LelouchVC2: What are these clashes? Like tournaments or something?
 MSmits: just short games
 Uljahn: just fun time killers
 MSmits: not tournament, the is a leaderboard
 MSmits: but thats it
 MSmits: each arena has its own leaderboard
 LelouchVC2: contest* i meant
 MSmits: ah contests are more like multiplayer arenas
 MSmits: not like clashes at all
 MSmits: but contests are time limited, average 10 days
 MSmits: so if you use c++ you'll be fine
 LelouchVC2: Ah, I see. Bot programming in the multiplyer area
 MSmits: Yes
 LelouchVC2: Thanks &lt;3
 MSmits: np, btw the multiplayer arenas are *not* time limited. Some will work for a year on a bot :P
 MSmits: some arenas dont have such bots though, it depends on the arenas popularity
 LelouchVC2: That's intense, guess I'll check it out&#160;:))
 MSmits: sure
 LelouchVC2: This site is a bit broken. 2nd time now my code gets a score of 100% after it wouldn't say I passed some test while debugging
 LelouchVC2: I never find the issue with my code, and just submit it, and then it says my score is 100%&#160;;-;
 MSmits: ah it's not the site that is broken. I've done over 100 puzzles. Many puzzles are user created and not all users are equally good at it.
 MSmits: however
 MSmits: the testcases are not equal to the validator tests
 MSmits: if your code does not pass the testcases, it may still pass the validators
 MSmits: ideally the validators and testcases are very similar, but they cant be identical, because then you can hardcode the result
 MSmits: so you may just have run into a situation where the validators are just different enough to help you pass the puzzle
 LelouchVC2: Ahh, I see
 LelouchVC2: That explains why I pass all the tests a few times and still got less than 100%
 MSmits: yes, it happens
 MSmits: you may have misunderstood something the creator meant in the statement 
 MSmits: sometimes they are less clear
 MSmits: then your code does not handle 1 specific situation very well
 MSmits: and it may either have problems with the validators or the testcases
 LelouchVC2: There are a good number of puzzles that are very poorly worded, so I end up just looking at the tests to code them instead
 MSmits: Thats true. By the way, high level players can edit the puzzles
 MSmits: I improved a puzzle before
 LelouchVC2: Nice! Maybe I'll get there
 MSmits: Yeah, it is mostly a time spent thing
 MSmits: xp that is
 MSmits: cp is competitive, that's different
 LelouchVC2: Like playing MMORPGs all over again 
 MSmits: you dont get cp for puzzles
 MSmits: hah right
 LelouchVC2: Well, I'm outta here &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: Thanks for the information&#160;:))
 MSmits: np!
 tsiryJL: it's funny!!
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MadKnight: hey MSmits
 MSmits: hey
 MadKnight: how's your teachings&#160;?
 MSmits: on break till thursday next week
 darkhorse64: How is your Onitama version&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: ssmiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiito
 MSmits: havent found any improvement in the last 24 hrs
 MSmits: hi zarthy 
 MSmits: still have to fit exploration, hope to get some improvement from that
 ZarthaxX: hellou
 MSmits: once I am done with that I am moving on to a different game, probably STC, or maybe I'll try improve my Bandas
 darkhorse64: You showed me impressive stats. It's not the one you submitted
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MSmits: it is I think
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe081cb1-51dc-4ba1-90b2-42b9d292d9c4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe081cb1-51dc-4ba1-90b2-42b9d292d9c4</a>
 MSmits: but tric trac submitted after
 darkhorse64: I expected a wider margin
 MSmits: might be this one is overfitted vs his older version
 MSmits: only 100 games
 MSmits: bad statistics
 MSmits: i have 4 wins 5 losses vs karlis o on cg stats
 darkhorse64: I had abandoned all hopes
 MSmits: thats not a lucky submit
 MSmits: not with 65% winrate in cg bench
 MSmits: but totally possible with randomness
 MSmits: why abandon hopes?
 MSmits: your bot actually does better than any other vs me in that test :P
 MSmits: I have seen a few versions with 85% vs you though... it's really tough to choose a version
 darkhorse64: I tried to change my evaluation from Win/loss/draw to a normalized value but failed. I did that because I noticed that when I am ahead in material, sometimes my bot seems clueless. Every move seems good
 MSmits: also quite easy to pick an opponent and overfit. I only selected these 4 to have a nice spread
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: I have a normalized value
 MSmits: Just pick a high number for the maximum score and fit all your constants in relation to this
 darkhorse64: May be I am doing it wrong. Divide by max value
 MSmits: i divide by a constant max value
 MSmits: it's always the same value, doesnt change during the game
 MSmits: in my case it is 10000
 MSmits: just wanted to make it high so i can use integers
 MSmits: so if p1 has 5000 points, I will backpropagate 0.5
 MSmits: and -0.5 for p2
 MSmits: if p1 has 20000 points, then I will backpropagate 1, because it is above the maximum
 MSmits: I do this in oware as well
 MSmits: the difference is in what things about the board you evaluate and how much they are worth to you. This makes your bot behave strategically different and causes these enormous rps effects
 darkhorse64: I have a constant too but may be it's wrong because I see node values barely making it above 0.7 just right before my solver takes over and claims a win
 MSmits: well... they dont have to be exact, the node values only have to guide you in the right direction
 darkhorse64: You have two ways to win in Onitama. I have noticed that y bot is better when the node values use the full range [-1,1]
 darkhorse64: *my*
 MSmits: well that makes sense, but sometimes the assumptions are wrong
 MSmits: the things you evaluate
 MSmits: maybe you evaluate the number of knights and you have 3 knights, the opponent has 1, but it kills your master. Or his master sneaks onto your shrine
 MSmits: maybe your knights are positioned badly
 darkhorse64: OK but its seems less wrong with Win/Loss (except for the case of material advantage). May be my eval is wrong: material + king/pawn position on the board
 MSmits: that's the simple eval i started with, but it is very different now. I don't want to give too much away, but mine is definitely fundamentally different. 
 MSmits: I don't have too many constants btw
 MSmits: just 5
 darkhorse64: Not need to. I have googled many different evals
 MSmits: 6 if you count the max score, but that can be scaled to anything
 MSmits: ah i see
 MSmits: yeah I found some, but I am not using them
 MSmits: i think there were 2 that i saw
 MSmits: one had a grid with numbers for position values for any piece
 MSmits: and one had two grids, one for master and one for knight
 MSmits: and i think most counted the number of knights
 MSmits: not sure what else there is
 darkhorse64: This one looks like mine. I have seen also evals that rate the poisitions according to the cards in hand and another that has parameters such as king safety,
 darkhorse64: Probably closer to yours
 darkhorse64: Anyway my purpose is not to "borrow" your eval, rather to understand how to better use the result of my eval (or realize that I should ditch it)
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: well dont discount a possible eval too quickly. A submit is really a bad test
 MSmits: several times I have found the range in which a constant for a particular part of the eval is good, is a very small range
 darkhorse64: #if 0 is my friend
 MSmits: so say the constant can be between 0 and 2000, reasonably, only between 500 and 600 is good, anything else will be mediocre or bad
 MSmits: so i just spread out some possible values, see if theres a pattern
 MSmits: try to maximize in ghetto hill climbing style with excel
 MSmits: at one time I had 8 eval traits with most having constant 0. I think the compiler optimizes them out
 darkhorse64: Going back to work. Still home but working
 MSmits: then i just try different values. Currently i only have 4 eval traits because I wasnt able to improve with the other 4. But I might have missed several combinations that would have been better
 MSmits: allright have a good work day. I am studying my AI class currently
 MSmits: Already finished most of the 8 week course in a few days :P
 eulerscheZahl: that way you will forget most of it again till the exam :P
 MSmits: haha maybe
 MSmits: I am working on the last part now. Almost finished the video. It's about hill climbing SA, linear programming, constraint satisfaction etc.
 MSmits: then i need to do something with a crossword puzzle generator
 MSmits: as an assignment
 eulerscheZahl: sounds fun
 MSmits: it has 2 more parts that aren't in the required curriculum that I might do also, just because they're interesting, that's about Q-learning and neural networks and stuff. I just wonder if the assignments for that are any good
 MSmits: it's a pretty short class (80 hrs) so they cut that off. 
 MSmits: which is kind of sad, because it is one of the few subjects I could learn a lot from
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://azspcs.com/Contest/AlphabetCity">http://azspcs.com/Contest/AlphabetCity</a>your crossword puzzle assignment
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/projects/3/crossword/">https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/projects/3/crossword/</a>
 MSmits: this is the assignment
 MSmits: at least I think it is.... I am working way ahead, my class is still working part one. 
 MSmits: part 0 actually
 Astrobytes: The Al Zimmermann one looks pretty cool
 MSmits: which one is that?
 eulerscheZahl: a python assignment MSmits?
 Astrobytes: The one euler linked
 MSmits: yes eulerscheZahl. I am getting much better with pyton now. 
 MSmits: it's pretty awesome what you can do with sets and such
 eulerscheZahl: al zimmerman has optim puzzles once in a while. one is running right now
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've seen some 
 eulerscheZahl: for smaller scripts i really like python
 MSmits: yeah me too
 eulerscheZahl: when it gets bigger, i prefer a strongly typed language
 MSmits: python can get confusing quickly if you're not careful
 MSmits: things like is vs == or  the "in" keyword
 MSmits: i had dictionaries within dictionaries a few times. And sometimes you use "in" and instead of finding out whether some value is in the dictionary, you are testing whether a dictionary is within a dictionary and it always returns true
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: within c++ these things take so much time to code, you'll spot the error while writing it
 MSmits: python will hide it
 eulerscheZahl: compilation fail vs runtime fail
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: more than a few times I have written a python function of 10 lines and it turns out i could do it in 2 lines and then decided to drop the function entirely 
 eulerscheZahl: Record a 1- to 5-minute screencast in which you demonstrate your project’s functionality.
 MSmits: dont think i have to do that
 MSmits: my class is derivative of the harvard class, it's not the same class
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 MSmits: it uses the same assignments i think though, at least the first one is the same
 MSmits: and uses the videos
 eulerscheZahl: do you have to submit?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but not to harvard
 eulerscheZahl: on github?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: some website with a system for this
 MSmits: i upload files
 MSmits: this is my teacher
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Jelleas">https://github.com/Jelleas</a>
 MSmits: but so far we've just had an introductory class, I am not sure if he's going to do much lecture style teaching, because we have these videos
 MSmits: he does some work for Harvard as well, which is probably why we do the CS-50 stuff
 LoGos: speaking about python and c++ both have some unpleasant suprises in them
 LoGos: like these:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/ExC7Om">https://ideone.com/ExC7Om</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/kp0X6Y">https://ideone.com/kp0X6Y</a>
 Nerchio: this dude looks like he would stay in bronze forever in challenges Msmits
 LoGos: me? why?
 Nerchio: no 
 Nerchio: Msmits teacher
 ZarthaxX: lol what
 ZarthaxX: why are you insulting him 
 Nerchio: who?
 ZarthaxX: the teacher
 Nerchio: not really an insult but i always felt weird when the teacher was super young
 pb4: LoGos&#160;: I don't understand the python example, why does it behave like this&#160;?
 Nerchio: although usually when they were young they were just doing phd and sent to do classes by the professor 
 ZarthaxX: so just a dumb comment ok
 Uljahn: default value is mutable
 Nerchio: whatever floats your boat ZarthaxX ^^
 pb4: what does it mean mutable&#160;?
 pb4: when Is the default value initialized&#160;?
 pb4: or re-initialized&#160;?
 Uljahn: list is a container, it bounds to the argumen when function definition is parsed by interpreter, then you are free to change it's content i guess
 Uljahn: i have some more of this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython">https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython</a>
 WINWINWIN: Guys, I`m writing a sim for fantastic bits
 WINWINWIN: will I get till gold if I ignore collisions
 WINWINWIN:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: even legend
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio i just didnt get why you said a teacher wouldnt get past bronze lol like sense comment for the current chat, no offense sorry :P
 ZarthaxX: nonsense*
 WINWINWIN: K thanks&#160;:) eulerscheZahl
 wlesavo: just pushed two people to fantastic bits gold
 WINWINWIN: wlesavo u in fantastic bits top silver too?
 WINWINWIN: Which lang? I`m using python3
 wlesavo: same
 WINWINWIN: Written ur sim already?
 wlesavo: some simple ass heuristic bot, i though i would be able to make it to gold with only two spells, and almost did it, but not quite
 WINWINWIN: Me too, thats what all the post mortems (including Bob`s) say&#160;:)
 wlesavo: im beating boss quite reliably, but somehow strugling on some submits to make it to top
 WINWINWIN: Yes, my win rate against boss is at least 90% but I am not able to get past 5 in silver
 WINWINWIN: tried adding obliviate and now at 42&#160;:(
 wlesavo: im sometimes submiting in #2, while doing that pushed two people in gold, so it is gonna be easier now i guess
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) will try my #5 bot then
 BeeGee: Is there a list somewhere with chatroom names?
 ZarthaxX: nope
 BeeGee: Thanks
 Uljahn: there are barely more than 3 active rooms here
 dbdr: #de #fr #ru
 BeeGee: Haha, oke
 wlesavo: nice list :slight_smile:
 dbdr: #random_chan
 thomasyuyu: wor
 AntiSquid: BeeGee get pidgin and join random chatroom <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 MSmits: Nerchio teacher does look young. And I have no idea how good he would be at arena's, but pretty sure he'd make gold. What we do here is pretty specialized knowledge. You can be a great coder and not do too well here
 wlesavo: maybe invite him for the next contest? i think he could like it
 MSmits: yeah I plan to share this with them
 AntiSquid: MSmits coming out and sharing his dirty secret
 ZarthaxX: *hey teacher wanna get smacked by me on a CG AI contest?*
 ZarthaxX: smito just showing off
 AntiSquid: that question sounds awkward
 ZarthaxX: dirty mind squido
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Illedan: ^^
 Illedan: Damn, smitsimax is hard on FB -.-
 ZarthaxX: hi illo
 Illedan: yo
 MSmits: Illedan it is, because you have two different states that require a different set of actions
 Illedan: 2 states?
 MSmits: either you have the sniggle, or whatever its called, or you dont
 Illedan: true
 MSmits: that complicates things
 MSmits: I considered trying it on FB, but the sim is so complex, I got turned off of it
 MSmits: maybe at some point
 Illedan: I use the same node for having the ball and not having it :D
 MSmits: well you can, but you have to give it different sets of children
 MSmits: you choose a set based on this fact
 Illedan: hmmm, I don't do that :P
 MSmits: probably a good thing to start with&#160;:)
 MSmits: otherwise I dont know how you would do this
 MSmits: realistically
 Illedan: With enough sims it should work on full random right? :P
 MSmits: full random&#160;?
 MSmits: what does that mean in this case?
 Illedan: Node selection
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: well you still need  to have a tree that gives valid moves
 Illedan: Sure does
 Illedan: 8 angles at each laye
 Illedan: r
 MSmits: your valid moves will be different based on whether you have the ball
 Illedan: with ball = throwwithout = move
 Illedan: In that angle
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: if you do it full random though, what would the point of collecting statistics be?
 Illedan: true, only need for the 1st layer
 MSmits: right, well you can do this and then check for just 1 more layer to see if my idea with two sets of children works
 MSmits: and do the rest random
 MSmits: if it works, you can do more
 MSmits: a monte carlo transitioning into a mcts type thing
 MSmits: there are many variations you can do. All you're really interested in is a way to symmetrically take opponent actions into account
 MSmits: something that's difficult with GA. Even so GA might be better here
 Illedan: yeah, just wanted to try this thing
 Illedan: Ga would be far easier
 MSmits: cool, keep me posted&#160;:)
 Illedan: Since I didn't include spells yet
 Illedan: they are a buggy if
 Illedan:&#160;::)
 MSmits: hm yea, for sure do it without spells first. I would personally only consider spells for the first layer
 MSmits: thats what i do with shield in csb, works fine there
 Illedan: yeah.. but these spells require positioning?
 Illedan: Some atleast
 MSmits: no idea, maybe my way is crap for FB
 MSmits: I was thinking about this for meanmas
 MSmits: meanmax
 Illedan: Yeah, would be the same thing I guess
 MSmits: the reason to include it on the first layer is just to give you the option of using it
 MSmits: if its not in the tree at all, you'll never use them
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: Now I override a possible better action with a spell
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: usually i put in a penalty for using a spell so i only use it when it is enough of an advantage
 MSmits: because it costs mana
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: my if is very stupid
 Illedan: if (angleToGoal &lt; 25) FIRE!
 MSmits: works&#160;:)
 Illedan: and some dist
 Illedan: sure
 WINWINWIN: what is smitsimax?

 angryOctupus: What bot programming puzzle to start with here&gt;
 angryOctupus:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: onboarding
 angryOctupus: done some of the easy puzzles already
 angryOctupus: and a medium one
 AntiSquid: then do more puzzles in easy / medium at random or just do a multiplayer
 angryOctupus: wanted to know which multi to start with
 AntiSquid: well what's your skill level like and what games do you like?
 angryOctupus: very low skill level,
 Astrobytes: Continue with easy and medium puzzles
 AntiSquid: if you can write if else then try this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a> angryOctupus
 angryOctupus: K
 Uljahn: start with coders strike back, it has a tutorial
 AntiSquid: if you are good at trigonometry only!! angryOctupus otherwise avoid coders strike back
 angryOctupus: will try botters of the galaxy because if else and some sorting and searching is all I know
 AntiSquid: that's all you need angryOctupus
 angryOctupus: thanks AntiSquid
 Uljahn: that's enough for CSB too
 AntiSquid: you need trigonometry and lot of calculations 
 AntiSquid: if you like physics games do csb sure
 angryOctupus: I like physics so coders strike back then?
 Uljahn: just try it
 Uljahn: it's free
 AntiSquid: botters is better though
 AntiSquid: actually you can look at the replays and see what the games are like 
 angryOctupus: Starte Coders Strike Back
 AntiSquid: angryOctupus if you need help with it there's a useful chat bot for it, just type "-help MadKnight" to trigger the bot
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: without the quotes ofc
 angryOctupus: How did someone build a chatbot which can understand what you say and advice?
 AntiSquid: it understands CSB related topics
 AntiSquid: nothing else
 angryOctupus: Who made it?
 AntiSquid: same people who made CSB
 angryOctupus: K, thanks AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: np
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 angryOctupus: -help MadKnight
 angryOctupus: Is it always online or only at specific times
 AntiSquid: might be offline, let me check the other bots
 AntiSquid: -help Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah i know it can be useful
 angryOctupus: WOW
 AntiSquid: -help AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same speed of your current league and u will have to go to sleep?
 AntiSquid: i guess madao is broken&#160;:/
 angryOctupus: Does not make much sense&#160;:/
 angryOctupus: AutomatonNN how is boost different from 100 thrust?
 AutomatonNN: I have also think that is a new search algorithm and will be hard to predict where position is a goo
 AntiSquid: well these guys are less coherent
 angryOctupus: who made the automatons
 angryOctupus:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: some user
 AntiSquid: hover the avatar, it will tell you
 angryOctupus: MadKnight doesnt have any such details
 MadKnight: who coded AntiSquid to lie to newbies about other users being chatbots, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: there is a wall in between, you reassure each other and thus lose only 1 sanity instead ."
 MadKnight: u need to uncode AntiSquid Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: was just to see if it works
 Astrobytes: lol
 MadKnight: it does work, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you got the same problem
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: quite sure it was a chat bot in the previous iterations
 AntiSquid: no lies told
 AntiSquid: are you playing in the next contest MadSnowflake_b78b?
 AntiSquid: MadKnight *
 MadKnight: probably
 MSmits: lol... for a moment I thought you were trying to insult MadKnight, AntiSquid
 MSmits: but just a tab-error
 Astrobytes: A pretty good one at that
 MSmits: yeah I laughed :P
 MSmits: actually i cant tab the snowflake
 Astrobytes: Probably left
 MSmits: mmh ok
 reCurse: I can still tab it
 MSmits: weird
 reCurse: But yeah it's pretty funny it's not an intentional jab, especially considering it's coming from AntiSquid
 inoryy: lol
 Ganondorf10987: hey, does anybody know how to adjust the built-in "IDE"-s, if you will, to use actual tab characters for indentation, instead of 4 spaces?
 AntiSquid: nah, not the snowflake one, kinda annoyed i can't tab Automaton2000 without getting Automaton2020 btw
 Automaton2000: i mean i have a bunch of other things
 AntiSquid: Ganondorf10987 not sure what you mean , just use the tabs if you want tabs
 AntiSquid: and ctrl + mouse scroll to adjust size quickly
 Kukiss: and there were some more detailed settings with ctrl + "," I believe but it seems to to no longer works
 AntiSquid: F1
 AntiSquid: new menu though
 reCurse: They changed the IDE editor component with very little notice
 Kukiss: uu
 Kukiss: I noticed new colors but didn't look if there is something more :D
 Kukiss: I just copy and paste anyway
 eulerscheZahl: from ACE editor to Monaco
 reCurse: It's more or less the same as VS code now
 AntiSquid: great choice
 Astrobytes: Anything is an improvement over that old ACE editor
 reCurse: Anything?
 Astrobytes: Well... 
 reCurse: You're not creative enough if you think that
 reCurse: Could be a textarea with courier new font
 Astrobytes: Alright, alright. This is a major improvement. I'll leave it at that :P
 AntiSquid: obv should use Helvetica Neue font
 reCurse: The new font for output and the new leaderboard in IDE though
 reCurse: That's a downgrade
 Astrobytes: Yeah, can't disagree there
 reCurse: Apologies to whoever worked on that but that new leaderboard layout is ugly
 eulerscheZahl: horrible IDE idea: 1-lines textbox with 100 chars limit and in password mode, only showing *
 reCurse: Should be a new CoC game mode
 AntiSquid: new leaderboard doesn't make sense
 reCurse: If only because I enjoy torturing those players
 inoryy: select boxes per char
 Astrobytes: Sounds like a puzzle Benjamin would come up with
 Illedan: Wow, my wizard scores self goal without anything nearby -.-Stupid eval..
 eulerscheZahl: bad search not finding a move to avoid that
 Illedan: Yeah, 2000 playouts with dept 4 might be too low&#160;:/
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456019101">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456019101</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, well played
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are still in gold
 eulerscheZahl: didn't you try this years ago?
 Illedan: Yeah, stopped when I got to gold with my stim :P
 Illedan: 11 months since last submit
 eulerscheZahl: you avoided throwing at the bludger
 Illedan: I only test 8 angles
 Astrobytes: Which algo?
 Illedan: smitsi
 Astrobytes: Ohhh
 Illedan: Wanted to see if I could make it work
 Illedan: I consider GA cheating :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 DaFish: No, smitsimax is cheating
 Illedan: Not on FB
 Astrobytes: isn't it kinda similar to BR2K or CSB? Except with spells? And bludgers
 Illedan: Problem is the throwing
 Illedan: I wonder if 8 angles are enough
 Illedan: probably for depth 4..
 MSmits: you should do 8 angles for moving, but for throwing I would not use fixed angles
 MSmits: just create a heuristic that shoots to score
 Illedan: hmm
 MSmits: you can do a node that says: Score heuristic as one of the available moves
 MSmits: next to a fixed set of angles
 MSmits: its just 1 extra node
 MSmits: if its bad, search will eliminate it
 MSmits: you can experiment, see how often it gets used
 Illedan: true
 LoGos: eulerscheZahl do you know that in Bandas your bot always crashes when ther's a draw?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Illedan: shhh
 eulerscheZahl: so it's not a draw then :D
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait i remember
 LoGos: Yeah :D
 eulerscheZahl: i allocate some nodes in turn 1
 MSmits: ahh node pool ends
 eulerscheZahl: and if the game lasts too long i run out of space
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 LoGos: that's what I thought
 LoGos: always about 70th move
 Astrobytes: Moar nodes
 LoGos: when usually ther's about 30-35 moves
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i do this: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2a8916ec-6614-43db-85eb-cae130174ffc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2a8916ec-6614-43db-85eb-cae130174ffc</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i think i used something like that too
 Astrobytes: reusing?
 eulerscheZahl: don't remember anymore why not in the arena version
 MSmits: I check if the node of the opponent is in my tree, if not i reset the pool. I also check if i am on the end of my pool, then i also reset
 LoGos: how do you paste something like that? I see pastebin and codingame in url
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah reusing
 eulerscheZahl: many text = paste
 MSmits: happens automatically 
 eulerscheZahl: much...
 Astrobytes: I do that in that seed game, reusing nodes that is
 eulerscheZahl: private const int size = (int)3e7;
 MSmits: oware
 Astrobytes: shhh
 MSmits: good game for reuse yes
 eulerscheZahl: so if i exceed 30 million nodes, i crash
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48a75499-9eec-4395-93aa-0055e51cf8af">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48a75499-9eec-4395-93aa-0055e51cf8af</a>
 LoGos: 30M&#160;!?! D:
 eulerscheZahl: i have a check
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow it's not working?
 eulerscheZahl: 30M for the whole game, not per turn
 MSmits: I use 25M
 MSmits: btw eulerscheZahl, it helps if you use mcts solver
 eulerscheZahl: and i create all child nodes when visiting a state
 MSmits: less nodes needed
 eulerscheZahl: i can't be bothered doing that
 MSmits: it's not that hard really
 eulerscheZahl: i did it for my connect4
 eulerscheZahl: check the code linked on my profile
 MSmits: ohh ok
 eulerscheZahl: (didn't read the paper, just coded what i thought it should look like)
 MSmits: I did read the paper but the pseudo code sucks
 LoGos: I have only like 1M nodes created per game
 MSmits: for which game?
 LoGos: Bandas
 MSmits: which language?
 LoGos: c++
 eulerscheZahl: i have slow C# and you have C++ superpowers
 AntiSquid: body language
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl you use c++ for bandas i think?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 MSmits: how else would you have 30M nodeS??
 eulerscheZahl: per game
 MSmits: thats not possible in C# I think
 MSmits: yes but you cant assign them 
 MSmits: too much memory written
 MSmits: or do you use unsaf?E
 LoGos: idk what's wrong with my codeI also switched to u_int64 from bitboards and only lost 3 places
 eulerscheZahl: i can and i will
 eulerscheZahl: my nodes are just int[] for plays, wins, child index, ...
 MSmits: mmhok
 eulerscheZahl: so all allocated in turn 1
 Astrobytes: LoGos, you have the pragmas? And use a preallocated pool of nodes?
 LoGos: yeah...
 MSmits: whenever i tried to get a nodepool, it would try to set all data to 0 and its too much memory to write
 LoGos: all Ofast, inline etc
 MSmits: in C# that is
 MSmits: over 2 million and it would crash me before the game even started

 eulerscheZahl: what game is that?
 MSmits: click share LoGos

 WINWINWIN: Can one of you suggest a definition for Move in fantastic bits?
 LoGos: ok?
 WINWINWIN: for a GA / SA
 eulerscheZahl: now it's loading, weird
 MSmits: its just a game of you running out of nodes
 LoGos: I clicked share, maybe that's why
 MSmits: WINWINWIN sorry cant help there
 MSmits: never done a SA or GA yet, even though I know the theory
 Illedan: :tada: top 100 gold :rocket: 
 eulerscheZahl: "clicked share"?
 eulerscheZahl: is there anything new on the website which i'm missing?
 MSmits: Illedan grats, no more self-goals?
 WINWINWIN: Not even for CSB Msmits?
 Illedan: Seems so
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl share replay
 WINWINWIN: used a minimax?
 Astrobytes: Yeah they changed the replay privacy settings or something recently eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: WINWINWIN no i dont use GA/SA there
 LoGos: "Replay and share" right bottom corner
 LoGos: when viewing replay
 eulerscheZahl: and now did you share the link before?
 MSmits: wait... I knew something euler didn't&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i know that button
 eulerscheZahl: just wondering how to share without clicking it
 eulerscheZahl: in the past i could drag and drop in the chat
 MSmits: I think you need to click it
 MSmits: or do you mean scripting?
 eulerscheZahl: somehow that isnt working anymore (browser setting?)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm wondering how LoGos shared the replay without clicking the button
 MSmits: real coders dont press buttons, they create scripts that press buttons
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: of course i can script it but i don't think that's what happened here
 Illedan: Real coders make the buttons to click
 LoGos: I copy-pasted link from CGBenchmark
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 MSmits: yeah thats a private ide game LoGos
 eulerscheZahl: so it was an external tool after all
 eulerscheZahl: and you are benching vs me :rage:
 MSmits: happens with any ide game
 LoGos: sory if I did something wrong. Just started using CGB thanks to MSmits's help
 MSmits: hey, leave me out of it :P
 LoGos: eulerscheZahl yeah :sweat:
 eulerscheZahl: but not to improve your winrate against me
 eulerscheZahl: (just kidding btw)
 LoGos: I only noticed it because somehow you crashed 3 times in a row :sweat_smile:
 Nhisoyr: hi, does anyone here know C#?
 eulerscheZahl: i little bit
 eulerscheZahl: a little bit
 Illedan: basic syntax
 MSmits: hah, you two
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: of us 3, I know a little bit
 Astrobytes: I know some but less than you MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: so go ahead and ask your question
 MSmits: doubt it Astrobytes, for bots I only ever need the basics
 Nhisoyr: is there a way to pass only one array inside a 2d array?  like {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6},{7,8,9}}. How'd i go about only getting only {1,2,3} without looping?
 eulerscheZahl: foreach (int i in array[0])
 MSmits: for(int i = 0; i &lt; array[0].length; i++)
 Astrobytes: *without looping
 MSmits: ow
 MSmits: array[0]
 eulerscheZahl: i'm illiterate, so is MSmits
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: wait is it jagged or 2D?
 Nhisoyr: it doesn't work for me. It says "Wrong number of indexes `1' inside [], expected `2'"
 MSmits: with jagged you do array[0]
 jacek: in other words, you cant C#
 MSmits: ah then it's real 2D
 Astrobytes: well played jacek
 eulerscheZahl: let's do some LINQ voodoo magic then
 MSmits: do da voodoo mon
 Nhisoyr: not used to C# yet. I used to code in Js and python tho i don't remember that much anymore i feel like that was easier to do xD
 MSmits: without numpy, 2D arrays are a pain in python
 eulerscheZahl: int[] sub = Enumerable.Range(0, test.GetLength(1)).Select(i =&gt; test[0, i]).ToArray();
 wlesavo: at least they are subscribable, but sure, its is much better without 2D lists
 eulerscheZahl: test = the 2d array
 MSmits: that spell is too high level for me, can't read
 Nhisoyr: i've no idea what you did there XD
 eulerscheZahl: Enumerable.Range is the looping part
 MSmits: (so it's still looping)
 eulerscheZahl: generate a sequence from 0, with array.GetLength(1) items
 Illedan: Even slower with the linq
 eulerscheZahl: yes, looping
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: of course it's slower
 eulerscheZahl: it's LINQ
 Illedan: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: but that wasn't the question
 MSmits: it's just looping more professionally
 eulerscheZahl: in a more obfuscated manner
 eulerscheZahl: define a jagged array if you need access to chunks
 MSmits: Nhisoyr how attached are you to your 2D array?
 MSmits: was just gonna say
 Nhisoyr: i'm ok with looping, I was just wondering if there was another way hahaha
 Nhisoyr: cause writing array[0] to get the first array inside a 2D array seemed logical to me
 eulerscheZahl: on a first look: yes. under the hood the Enumerable.Range is a loop again
 eulerscheZahl: with lazy evaluation
 MSmits: with c++ you just make a pointer&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: for a jagged array that's exactly what you do: array[0]
 MSmits: yeah
 LoGos: 0[array] 
 LoGos: in c++
 eulerscheZahl: you declare it as int[][] array instead of int[,] array
 Nhisoyr: ohhh
 Nhisoyr: thanks
 Nhisoyr: that should do it
 MSmits: the intialization is a bit different
 eulerscheZahl: an array of arrays
 MSmits: you need to loop when you initialize
 MSmits: be careful about that
 MSmits: googl eit
 Nhisoyr: ii'll test it in this challenge and see if it works, i'll read more abou it afterwards 
 MSmits: C# is great to use on CG. It's coder-friendly and quite fast for most purposes
 eulerscheZahl: for jagged arrays you can even have different lengths
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. storing pascal's triangle without wasting space
 eulerscheZahl: C# is my Swiss army knife
 eulerscheZahl: C++ is the scalpel
 MSmits: but looping over the full  2D range should be slower with varying lengths right?
 Nhisoyr: i was aware of jagged arrays but i hadn't used it before
 eulerscheZahl: jagged arrays should be slower
 eulerscheZahl: didn't do the benchmark, just guessing
 eulerscheZahl: 1 more indirection
 LoGos: Speaking about performance, do you use SSE and AVX?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/what-is-sse-and-avx">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/what-is-sse-and-avx</a>
 MSmits: Nhisoyr if speed is an issue, you can also do a 1D array and access it like array[x + width * y]
 MSmits: this is faster
 Nhisoyr: hm
 Nhisoyr: that makes sense
 MSmits: easier to make bugs of coruse
 MSmits: but if you're careful it's fine
 eulerscheZahl: for mono that really makes a difference. less for .net i think
 eulerscheZahl: but CG is still using Mono
 Astrobytes: the 1D representation is more natural than the 2D for me these days thanks to CG lol
 eulerscheZahl: i always code in 2D
 MSmits: heh thats what happened to me with bitboard
 LoGos: I saw this that's why I'm asking.Didn't read it though. I just can't figure how to explore 10x more nodes in mcts. I have "only" 100k new nodes per turn
 eulerscheZahl: and on the last day i convert to 1D if i need the speed
 Astrobytes: Yeah you said 2D is slower in Mono
 MSmits: LoGos there are several possible reasons
 MSmits: what is on one of your nodes
 eulerscheZahl: i can approximately double my simcount when i have lots of those array accesses
 eulerscheZahl: by 2D -&gt; 1D
 Astrobytes: That's a significant speedup
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, discovered it at A*Craft
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/04d1d02e-5688-4af9-9e48-9493d85e0f18">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/04d1d02e-5688-4af9-9e48-9493d85e0f18</a>
 Astrobytes: Have they upgraded yet?
 MSmits: my bandas node LoGos
 MSmits: maybe it helps
 eulerscheZahl: last time i checked: no
 LoGos: only one child&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I guess they'd announce it in the forum anyway when (if) they do
 MSmits: it is an index to the position in my node array where the first child is located
 LoGos: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/596ba6d3-af15-4c5c-b291-974bcc605887">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/596ba6d3-af15-4c5c-b291-974bcc605887</a>
 LoGos: oh...
 LoGos: smart
 LoGos: my GameState is just 3x unit64
 jacek: struct eh
 MSmits: mine is 2x
 eulerscheZahl: Console.WriteLine(Type.GetType ("Mono.Runtime"));Standard Output Stream:Mono.Runtime
 MSmits: and its on the node
 eulerscheZahl: should be null for .net core
 MSmits: ah yours is on the node too
 MSmits: bool current_player; //1 bit
 MSmits: this is not 1 bit
 LoGos: Maybe array access is faster than pointer deferencing?
 Astrobytes: A bool is a byte
 LoGos: I belive it is
 MSmits: ohh you mean byte
 MSmits: all your bits are bytes
 LoGos: yeah, sorry
 dbdr: (reacting to old chat) eulerscheZahl: I learned to program on a 1-line display
 LoGos: it's just faster to write bit
 dbdr: with BASIC :D
 LoGos: 3 letters
 eulerscheZahl: you can try bitfields. but padding will make it a byte anyways
 LoGos: and nothing is really measured in bits
 LoGos: bad habit
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr i wasn't aware how old you are :D
 MSmits: my whole node is 32 byte if i am counting correctly LoGos
 dbdr: not that old, just I was a kid
 dbdr: this was a pocket calculator
 eulerscheZahl: and now you aren't anymore
 eulerscheZahl: =&gt; old
 Astrobytes: Ah calculator programming :D
 dbdr: with a super tinay qwerty keyboard, a 1 line display and basic
 Astrobytes: TI-BASIC?
 dbdr: Sharp
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 Astrobytes: Great fun :D
 dbdr: there were real computers at the time, that's just what I had first
 Nerchio: i want to do statemachine for crystal rush, do you guys think i should go classes way/ interface or enums :p
 dbdr: maybe it was actually good practice
 dbdr: keep the program in your head
 MSmits: statemachine&#160;??
 Astrobytes: It is. Though I used to write mine on paper beforehand
 MSmits: do you just mean for the robots whether they are gathering, returning etc?
 Nerchio: y
 LoGos: MSmits let me calculate. And I also have a question. Is dimX, dimY the size of board? If so, then your "GameState" is 4 int's, not 2
 Nerchio: like a miner bot/ scanner bot etc. change their behaviour based on their situation
 MSmits: ahh, enums are fine i think
 MSmits: LoGos it;s 2 uint64_t
 MSmits: 1 for p1 and 1 for p2
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: i see what you mean
 LoGos: yeah, you are right. Again, my mistake
 MSmits: the dimx and dimy is the size of board
 LoGos: It's really more space efficient to store shape, not actual bitmask like I do
 MSmits: yeah, i do shift the board after a size decrease though
 MSmits: so it stays in the upper left corner
 MSmits: or upper right, not sure
 MSmits: anyway, this way one shift direction doesnt require a mask
 MSmits: it will just shift off the board&#160;:)
 MSmits: also, if you want to go and create an endgame database, it's easier to do with my method
 MSmits: you can do lookups more easily
 MSmits: i never got around to doing that, but I was planning ahead
 MSmits: one more thing though, the reason you use less nodes might be entirely non-node related. It could just be your move action is slow
 LoGos: Profiler tells me the same...i am very thankful for your help!If it's OK, I am going to try out some of things you shared wth me
 jacek: copyright*
 Astrobytes: Smitsimarked
 LoGos: I'm going to credit him in comments
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: lol, np
 AntiSquid: give him a crown of laurels
 MSmits: :crown:
 MSmits: i'm going back to the crossworld puzzle generator, last assignment for AI class&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: that sounds more like a puzzle&#160;:/
 MSmits: well most of the thing is written, I just have to write the logic in 7 different functions
 MSmits: 2 down 5 to go
 MSmits: making stuff node and arc consistent, writing a backtracking algo
 Astrobytes: arcs?
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, the graph, gotcha
 MSmits: yeah they call edges arcs somehow
 Astrobytes: It's common
 Astrobytes: nodes/vertices and arcs/edges
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: I am confused about something. It says I should make a list of all possible arcs
 MSmits: I am not entirely sure if that means i need to include both (x,y) and (y,x)
 MSmits: or if they are considered the same arc in this problem
 LoGos: In my language arc is bidirectional
 LoGos: so... only (x,y)?
 MSmits: I guess so
 Astrobytes: It can refere to directed edges
 MSmits: creating all arcs this way is a bit annoying in python
 Astrobytes: *refer
 MSmits: if you want to not include doubles
 MSmits: the variables are a set
 MSmits: I should create a copy of the set which I slowly empty to avoid doubles
 MSmits: or build up a set to check against
 MSmits: thats smarter
 MSmits: like explored nodes in bfs
 Astrobytes: 2nd one I think
 MSmits: yeah thats it
 AntiSquid: do they examine the code or just check if it works?
 MSmits: no idea, there are only 5 or 6 people in the class so they should have time to examine the code
 icecream17: I like the new code editor. You can scroll down way more
 MSmits: that's probably because you wrote more code?
 AntiSquid: no idea what you mean, but if you go to the bottom of your code press and hold enter for a while, scroll back to the top you can scroll an awful lot more
 icecream17: You can scroll past the last line, i mean
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid
 MSmits: that's a pro-tip AntiSquid 
 Astrobytes: icecream17 why the f do you consider scrolling past the last line of your code a likeable feature?
 AntiSquid: maybe it's to center the last line easier
 icecream17: idk. it just feels more cluttered when i code at the bottom and I can't scroll
 Astrobytes: :shrug:
 reCurse: Agreed
 struct: There are even some extensions so you dont have to press enter and make you just able to scroll after last line
 MSmits: hi struct
 struct: hi MSmits
 AntiSquid: oh just remembered ctrl+k followed by ctrl+0 now works in CG IDE :D
 icecream17: woah, all of my code just compressed into an array, while loop, and 2 functions
 AntiSquid: less scrolling :p
 AntiSquid: you can undo by clicking arrow on the side
 icecream17: A lot of arrows... there's this one line with 6 indentations
 struct: you folded everything?
 AntiSquid: ya there's a short cut to undo, forgot what it was don't use it much
 AntiSquid: collapsed @_@&#160;!
 struct: ctrl+k ctrl+j
 icecream17: i need a list of keyboard shortcuts...
 AntiSquid: VSC shortcuts&#160;? google&#160;? 
 icecream17: everything has different keyboard shortcuts. hmmm
 icecream17: Woah! ctrl + / automatically comments out a line
 LelouchVC2: Alt+F4 automatically ends your existence
 Uljahn: press F1 and scroll the drop-down menu, there are a lot of shortcuts
 Ganondorf10987: does anyone know why tf Ctrl + A doesn't work in the IDE?
 Ganondorf10987: also, why you can't paste anything into it?
 Ganondorf10987: and by IDE, I mean the built in text-editor
 reCurse: Works fine for me
 Ganondorf10987: legit??
 reCurse: Yeah
 AntiSquid: it works ...
 Ganondorf10987: ffs, I literally just wrote 5 hours worth of code (if not more) in Eclipse and now can't paste it here...
 Ganondorf10987: *angery*
 AntiSquid: i don't see how that's possible
 AntiSquid: save it to a file then if it's 5 hours
 AntiSquid: try later when you are clear headed
 Ganondorf10987: bruh, it's not that I'm not clear headed
 Ganondorf10987: also, don't worry, it's already saved in Eclipse :P
 Ganondorf10987: I wouldn't dare write code for more than 2 minutes without saving XD
 Ganondorf10987: but srsly, first it didn't work with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V) and now it's not working with literally right MB clicking, opening context menus and selecting copy
 Ganondorf10987: and then I come here, try to open the RMB context menu... literally nowhere to be seen
 Ganondorf10987: the paste option*
 Ganondorf10987: YO LEGIT
 Ganondorf10987: now I can't even copy/cut and paste from itself
 Uljahn: paste option is omitted in pop-up but ctrl+v works fine
 Uljahn: btw you can select a fragment and then ctrl+drag to copy it elsewhere in ide
 icecream17: npm install is in the cmd? can't believe i... aarrggh so easy
 icecream17: ECMAScript is pronounced EC MA? I always thought it was "m c a"....
 romrd468: why is my code magically breaking on turn 48 of CSB
 MadKnight: i dunno
 MadKnight: how exactly is it breaking&#160;?
 MadKnight: what exactly is happening&#160;?
 romrd468: entire code not running
 romrd468: I am super confused normally its my fault but I cant explain this.
 romrd468: I have 60 lines of code and it somehow decides to stop working on turn 48
 romrd468: 60 line not including comments and the standard loop
 MadKnight: show me your code
 romrd468: ok <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/29E6QK">https://codeshare.io/29E6QK</a>
 MadKnight: why do u have so many variables
 MadKnight: they will give all checkpoints on turn 1 in higher leagues
 romrd468: let me clean it up a bit
 MadKnight: just reset to default, subtract 3*vel from nextcheckpoint and it will get u to the next league
 romrd468: ok will do, am still confused why my code is not working
 MadKnight: so many ifs....
 MadKnight: one is probably brojken
 romrd468: I would expect it to crash instead of having no output
 MadKnight: maybe none of them output anything
 romrd468: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/456091718">https://www.codingame.com/replay/456091718</a>
 romrd468: and how did that player no it should BS
 romrd468: know
 MadKnight: your bot clearly broke after passing 2nd checkpoint
 romrd468: yeah but it works 99.9ish&#160;% of the time whats different about this case
 MadKnight: just reset the code, subtract 3*vel and get to the league when they give u all checkpoints
 romrd468: because its this case that is why I am not in legendary yet
 MadKnight: gold boss is stronger
 romrd468: yeah I can beat the boss a decent amount but than this case occurs
 MadKnight: in gold u will have 2 pods in your team
 romrd468: this is gold XD
 MadKnight: oh right lol
 MadKnight: i need to open replay
 MadKnight: oh so why do u have so many variables lol
 MadKnight: look at all those variables
 romrd468: Because I cant get around the rare test cases without them
 MadKnight: what's all these check0..15&#160;?
 MadKnight: arrays are for the weak&#160;?
 romrd468: that is storing x and y of each possible checkpoint
 romrd468: I could probably name things better but I couldn't come up with good names for some of these temp variables
 romrd468: I also was using a ton of code I removed which was for debugging
 romrd468: I tried using normal array techniques but I found it would erase the original value
 romrd468: or make up some funky thingsg
 romrd468: I now removed 200ish lines of comments
 romrd468: ops messed up at removing XD
 MadKnight: it wouldn't
 MadKnight: u can use arrays for that
 romrd468: I did use arrays just the google answer wasn't right
 romrd468: now its showing the errors but it wasn't earlier
 romrd468: and my code was 100% right besides spacing surprisingly
 MadKnight: if your arrays don't work it's not a reason to create 16 variables
 MadKnight: u just needed to fix the bug
 KiwiTae: +1
 MadKnight: hey KiwiTae
 MadKnight: are u gonna play next contest&#160;?

 LelouchVC2: @reCurse
 LelouchVC2: Lets do clash :D
 perseverent: I only heard of  mcts bots there
 perseverent: does minimax stand a chance?
 AntiSquid: i see kaggle is more cultured than CG: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/anime-with-stylegan/notebook">https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/anime-with-stylegan/notebook</a>
 pb4: perseverent&#160;: yes
 Key_Zhao: I start 2048 scores now :grimacing:
 Dessert: Hello guy! I just start use this website. I just sstart learn coding.
 LelouchVC2: Bot programming was fun since it was a big competition, but it's not really my thing&#160;:(
 LelouchVC2: I'll check out code golf I guess
 Astrobytes: Sure, not every category suits everyone&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: And not all black lives matter
 LelouchVC2: Finally, someone who gets it
 LelouchVC2: "Binary is good! But unary is much better!"
 LelouchVC2: Said no one ever
 Uljahn: 50 shades of unary, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: u will be able to reach legend in csb
 LelouchVC2: If you use 0s and spaces in unary
 LelouchVC2: Then it's basically binary
 jacek: good for you
 Kelaric: Start learning english kappa
 struct: Hello
 Astrobytes: Hi struct
 struct: Othello already has more players than Yinsh :p
 Astrobytes: lol yeah I saw that
 struct: The rules are simple so I guess that is the main reason
 Astrobytes: Probably, "simple to start, hard to master" right :P
 LelouchVC2: Kinda like knowing when a woman is giving off the right signals or not
 LelouchVC2: You dont wanna lean in and get slapped
 proglath: salut
 WINWINWIN: Hi proglath
 daffie: what is the time contraint on the weekly
 daffie: also I'm getting a strange error saying my code did not read all of the input, and it says this even for the default code provided for javascript
 daffie: oh nvm that error I fixed
 Hjax: i check on my pr2 bot, 151 straight games against siman
 Hjax: holy submits batman
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 struct: just get 100% win rate vs him
 struct: than you will be 1st
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i only have 30 matches in my history
 jrke: hey i wanna ask that boardsize is always same
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: board size on which game?
 Astrobytes: On Othello? Yes
 jrke: othello
 struct: I saw him submiting on othello
 jrke:&#160;:)
 Hjax: i should write a postmortem i guess
 Hjax: my bot is basically just munkres though 
 eulerscheZahl: that's fully optional
 eulerscheZahl: not even some Kuhn in it?
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: i probably could have ranked a bit higher if i had fixed an issue with my assignment 
 struct: Is the contest over'
 Hjax: right now i assign 1 pod per target 
 struct:&#160;?
 Hjax: yeah its over 
 Hjax: but with 1 pod per target, the leftovers dont have anything useful to do 
 Hjax: i finished 7th on contest, 31st on multi, and 3rd on progression 
 Hjax: not too shabby 
 eulerscheZahl: contest ends in 2.5h
 eulerscheZahl: but i know nothing about quantum computing, so i won't submit
 eulerscheZahl: RIP random tshirt
 Hjax: oh different contest? 
 eulerscheZahl: oh, which one were you talking about?
 struct: pr2
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77614">https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77614</a>
 Hjax: yeah pr2 ended like 6 hours ago 
 jrke: i ended 19th unofficial rank
 eulerscheZahl: the actual contest is next week. this is the practice round
 jrke: On codeforces
 struct: I didn't join pr2, I don't like hex grids
 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :P
 Hjax: are hex grids really any different from square grids? 
 Hjax: my bot doesnt even care what kind of grid its on, it would work fine on a square grid 
 Nerchio: i think they differ quite a bit you can't use a 2d array for it
 struct: you cant?
 Nerchio: i mean you can but you need transformations on it
 Hjax: my silly python bot just used dictionaries to hold everything 
 Hjax: pr2 didnt seem very speed intensive, so python was fine 
 struct: I dont know how pr2 grid work though
 struct: havent checked
 struct: On yinsh I used 2d with transformation yeah
 struct: on Yavalath I did a mess
 Hjax: your initialization input was all of the tiles on the map and a list of their neighbors 
 Astrobytes: Just had adjacency list for PR2
 Hjax: so i just stored that in a dict, easy lookups 
 Hjax: i still think its hilarious that python can just import munkres 
 Hjax: dont even have to implement it yourself 
 Nerchio: loool really :D
 Nerchio: did you use it?
 Hjax: yeah 
 Nerchio: nice!
 Hjax: thats probably my bots only strength 
 eulerscheZahl: i had to copy from github when i needed it for code of ice and fire&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: first try: too slow
 eulerscheZahl: second try: lightning fast but giving incorrect results
 Nerchio: you don't need to create a matrix for it or something?
 eulerscheZahl: then i found a java code and ported it. that one did the job
 Hjax: yeah my cost function is just distance - plat /distance
 Hjax: i create a matrix of that cost for every pod with every target
 Hjax: and throw it into scipy 
 Hjax: and boom, nice mappings 
 Nerchio: I need to try and implement this one day :D
 Nerchio: atm I still don't get what you are mapping to what
 eulerscheZahl: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/a-code-of-ice-fire-feedbacks-and-strategies/105722/18?u=eulerschezahl">https://forum.codingame.com/t/a-code-of-ice-fire-feedbacks-and-strategies/105722/18?u=eulerschezahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: different game, same idea
 eulerscheZahl: for PR2 i would create multiple imaginary nodes for each real node. reward dropping the more pods you move there
 Hjax: @Nerchio i have a bunch of places i want to send pods to, and i want to send pods in the most efficient way possible 
 eulerscheZahl: as kuhn-munkres generates 1-1 matches
 Hjax: munkres just calculates the most efficient mapping 
 Hjax: relatively quickly 
 Hjax: assuming you consider O(n^2) quick i guess
 Jonathan_Skywalker: How to solve this in Python
 Hjax: n^3*
 Hjax: oh thats kind of clever eulerscheZahl, i want to try that now 
 Hjax: i didnt consider that 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised, how did you handle it then?
 Hjax: thats what i was saying earlier, i only send 1 pod per target 
 Nerchio: euler so just find X hexes, Y cells, calculate score/cost for them and thats it?
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Nerchio: and make the matrix square
 Hjax: my extra pods move towards the closest target to them 
 Hjax: which isnt great 
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that's all you need Nerchio
 Nerchio: that's... relatively simple ;p
 eulerscheZahl: it is
 eulerscheZahl: if you copy the actual algo and don't code it yourself
 Nerchio: code of fire and ice is on my future to-do list :D
 Nerchio: ice &amp; fire xD
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/KevinStern/software-and-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/blogspot/software_and_algorithms/stern_library/optimization/HungarianAlgorithm.java">https://github.com/KevinStern/software-and-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/blogspot/software_and_algorithms/stern_library/optimization/HungarianAlgorithm.java</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's where i copied it from
 eulerscheZahl: comment in my code, thanks eulerscheZahl from the past
 RyanTuplin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/ryantupo">https://www.twitch.tv/ryantupo</a> come join got 22 people playing clash XD
 Nerchio: better not make the matrix too big xD
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, O(n^3) has some limitations
 Hjax: plenty fast enough for the biggest maps in PR2 though
 eulerscheZahl: except if you go for the lightning fast but incorrect implementation that i found
 Nerchio: lol
 Astrobytes: lol, speed &gt; correctness
 eulerscheZahl: i guess scipy is more optimized than what i found
 Nerchio: Hjax but how many cells did you calculate&#160;? all of them for all pods?
 Hjax: my targets are: any tile that ive seen but not visited, or any tile my opponent owns 
 Nerchio: I don't believe this :D
 Nerchio: okay
 Nerchio: makes sense
 Nerchio: then Matrix isn't that big
 Hjax: and i throw away useless tiles, dead ends with no platinum 
 eulerscheZahl: do you use symmetry in maps to find platinum faster?
 Hjax: nope! 
 Nerchio: I would need this algorithm only for nearby tiles for my pods 
 Nerchio: not all of them
 Nerchio: I also didn't use symmetry to find platinum faster
 Hjax: my bot is pretty barebones, i intended to improve it over the weekend, but i got lazy 
 Hjax: its only about 200 lines of python
 Nerchio: Im not sure how I would find symmetry on a hex map which hex corresponds to which
 eulerscheZahl: the ID assignment is key here
 struct: I think yavalath is a bit different
 Nerchio: yeah euler I guess I would need to decode id assignments :D
 Nerchio: which is something I am not a fan of
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dc338f3a-89a9-4dc9-84da-9666e00b688c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dc338f3a-89a9-4dc9-84da-9666e00b688c</a>
 Nerchio: it would be possible to compute it too but my computer would explode probably
 Hjax: man how many games have ID abuse 
 Nerchio: :D easy enough 
 eulerscheZahl: and
 Hjax: unleash the geek all over again 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6afa86ab-c0ce-459e-83e9-aae8e739b38e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6afa86ab-c0ce-459e-83e9-aae8e739b38e</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i do a little more, e.g. check if my base is symmetric to opponent base. but it's really not that much
 eulerscheZahl: and definitely helped me to climb some ranks
 Nerchio: I just did
 Nerchio: if my neighbours in distance X is less than his neighbours in distance X then my position is shit
 Nerchio: it doesnt take platinum into account since there is fog of war
 Nerchio: so not always true :D
 eulerscheZahl: but a good estimate if you include you own + opponent base
 eulerscheZahl: if gain &gt; loss, it's worth it
 Nerchio: I tried to judge the maps that are not worth playing out on one side
 Nerchio: rushing in that case is better than trying to win
 Hjax: oh i noticed you rushed me on some weird map Nerchio, i was wondering why
 Hjax: your bot was just like, this map sucks 
 Nerchio: yep im not playing it :D
 Hjax: i ran some tests, on the most unfair maps rank 900 beats rank 1 
 Hjax: kind of silly 
 Nerchio: yeah some maps were too broken
 Nerchio: but i tried to turn these little-broken into wins against players outside of the very top
 Nerchio: poor Illedan
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/472469787">https://www.codingame.com/replay/472469787</a>
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: my bot generally has pretty good rush defense
 Hjax: it only messes up if it loses vision of the rush 
 Hjax: which i never got around to fixing 
 Nerchio: Neumann
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472468967">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472468967</a>
 Nerchio: see its not a bad strategy :p
 Hjax: yeah i like it 
 Hjax: i might copy it 
 Nerchio: you turn a probable loss into a sometimes win - sometimes draw - sometimes lose
 Nerchio: thats a good trade :P
 Hjax: yeah 
 mohammad_alrefae: hi
 Neumann: That's the equivalent of a 6-pool
 Neumann: Shameful
 Hjax: im not sure if you know or not Neumann, but nerchio is a very good zerg player 
 Neumann: I'm aware of that
 Hjax: do you play starcraft too? :D 
 Neumann: Yup
 struct: starcraft port when?
 Hjax: we already have A* Craft
 Hjax: what else could you ask for 
 Neumann: Not the same level tho
 Hjax: im a gm toss player on the NA server, also cant hold a candle to him
 Neumann: NA GM&#160;? Like EU Plat&#160;?
 reCurse: Uh? I thought it was just a coincidence.
 reCurse: So it's the actual Nerchio?
 Hjax: yeah 
 struct: yes
 Neumann: reCurse: y
 reCurse: I remember watching your games a long time ago. Nice
 struct: I saw him typing on a CG stream once with his twitch account
 Hjax: i asked him during pacman when i saw him here 
 Hjax: @Neumann hey give me some credit, at least EU diamond 
 Hjax: :P
 Neumann: jk&#160;;)
 Hjax: i have a few good wins against decent pro players, i beat TRUE in a clanwar once, thats my best achievement 
 Neumann: Clean
 Hjax: not going to lie, i had some amount of pride in being the best starcraft player thats active on this site 
 Hjax: Nerchio took it away from me D: 
 Nerchio: rip your title Hjax&#160;:(
 Hjax: youre too gosu
 Nerchio: also winning with protoss is not very difficult Hjax
 reCurse: :popcorn:
 Hjax: oof
 Neumann: Terran ftw
 Uljahn: rush with Automaton2000s
 Automaton2000: all test cases but when i want to have the same feeling
 WINWINWIN: People are still focussing on PR2? I thought that it would be forgotten by now :P
 Astrobytes: Just discussing their approaches 'post-contest' WINWINWIN
 reCurse: Largely underrated game
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I hadn't played it until thibpat's contest. 10/10 will go back to it.
 WINWINWIN: Yes, was quite interesting but among the least participation
 reCurse: It's not official so it's unrealistic to compare
 WINWINWIN: I meant purely as a multi, onlt 1.7K participants vs the common 2.5K
 reCurse: Wasn't it the second multi ever on CG?
 reCurse: Not so bad
 reCurse: Population back then was nothing like now
 WINWINWIN: CSB first, then PR1 then PR2?
 reCurse: Uh no.
 WINWINWIN: If CSB wasnt the first, why the big hype around it?
 reCurse: Because it's part of onboarding and it's successful in the "easy to grasp but hard to master" category
 reCurse: I was also wrong, PCR, GOD and Tron preceder PR.
 reCurse: *preceded
 WINWINWIN: Understood, I checked it, CSB was pretty recent
 Astrobytes: Was GoD first or Tron?
 reCurse: Tron
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 WINWINWIN: Were you all on CG back then?
 reCurse: No I joined around Hypersonic
 Astrobytes: I wasn't, joined up in 2015 but didn't compete until Code Royale
 reCurse: Well I actually joined before CB but I didn't even do multis back then. I just stumbled on CG because someone posted about CoC somewhere else.
 reCurse: Thought it was kinda dumb but I liked the puzzles so I stayed
 WINWINWIN: So you won a contest on your 4th attempt?? Wow!
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I had no clue about the competitions or I would've tried to participate sooner. Was a busy period of my life though, didn't have much free time
 reCurse: 5th attempt. The Accountant doesn't show for some reason
 reCurse: Only shows when it's your own profile
 reCurse: I'm guessing it's some stupid legal reason
 WINWINWIN: Still.. amazing
 reCurse: I'm just salty I didn't win FB :P
 WINWINWIN: :D I saw the postmortem "Large lead" but Magus released his GA too late
 Magus: in fact, pb4 discovered a massive bug in it's code after the contest
 wlesavo: hm, i can see the accountant on your profile
 Magus: something like it's AI during the contest can only pick an angle between 0 and 255
 Magus: (instead of 0 to 359)
 Magus: there's a big chance that i am just lucky
 WINWINWIN: Probably that you may not need to turn around completely that often?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Someone should make a blokus multi 
 MostComplicatedUsername: :D
 daffie: whats tht
 MostComplicatedUsername: blokus is a board game
 Astrobytes: Just looks like really slow Tron
 Nerchio: cant play accountant anymore?
 struct: nope Nerchio
 Nerchio: feelsbad
 Nerchio: what was it about?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WecV6SlRgGQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WecV6SlRgGQ</a>
 struct: Basicly enemies tried to collect data points
 struct: The shot dealt damage based on distance
 struct: closer = more damage
 struct: If you are in N range from enemy you die
 struct: Enemy moved to closest data point or to you? cant recall
 struct: ok, always moved to closest data point
 struct: you got score based on data points left
 struct: Not sure if shots fired aftected score
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87127559-abcc-43e1-b9cb-3c885dbe841c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87127559-abcc-43e1-b9cb-3c885dbe841c</a>
 reCurse: Oops
 reCurse: Anyway that's the bonus
 reCurse: Data survival is 100 points and 10 points per kill
 reCurse: Was pretty fun, I also ignored all the evils of optim games back then
 eulerscheZahl: coding for validators instead of playing the actual game? or what evils?
 reCurse: Yeah that
 reCurse: Many contestants were just running a MC and spam submit
 reCurse: Hope for the best
 eulerscheZahl: that's mostly a CG exclusive problem
 reCurse: Oh I know
 reCurse: A*C solved it for a contest format
 reCurse: Too bad they didn't do that for a $10k contest :P
 eulerscheZahl: still too few validators for a stable ranking
 eulerscheZahl: but so much better than TAC
 struct: They should run hidden test cases at end of contest right?
 reCurse: Yes that's what A*C did
 struct: Were players warned of this?
 eulerscheZahl: i even thought about semi-hardcoding (checking for transformations/rotations of known testcases and such)
 reCurse: Only for hardcoding
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't do it in the end
 reCurse: T1024 extracted all validators, got DQed for it
 eulerscheZahl: not correct reCurse
 reCurse:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: he tested different random seeds
 eulerscheZahl: if (datapoints.count == 12) seed = 241
 eulerscheZahl: something like that
 reCurse: Ok my memory failed me
 reCurse: Still hardcoded against validators
 reCurse: Just not as accurately
 eulerscheZahl: optimizing the randomness. still solving online
 struct: reCurs is your STC NN or no comment?
 reCurse: Wouldn't you like to know
 eulerscheZahl: i bet against NN
 struct: Yeah&#160;:)
 struct: I was think is not NN but wanted to be sure
 eulerscheZahl: the top wasn't that strong for STC. i was 3rd without any kind of opponent prediction
 reCurse: Ehh I beg to differ
 eulerscheZahl: and a minimax-ish algo to it. that might already to the trick
 reCurse: Was no cakewalk
 eulerscheZahl: that impressive lead wasn't easy for sure
 reCurse: Going even against top 3 was already quite some work
 reCurse: Also probably hardest legend boss of CG
 eulerscheZahl: i'd like to disagree
 reCurse: On which part
 struct: I also think it's the hardest, but I haven't played many
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand: i really struggled with UTTT and wondev woman legend. but league size says that they aren't that hard
 eulerscheZahl: "hardest legend boss" part
 reCurse: Ok
 struct: for me UTTT boss was no problem
 eulerscheZahl: by league size coders of the caribbean is a tough boss
 reCurse: Size does not matter :P
 reCurse:&#160;% maybe
 reCurse: But even then
 eulerscheZahl: PCR wasn't that hard
 eulerscheZahl: still small legend
 eulerscheZahl: let's just agree that Tron is an easy legend then&#160;;)
 reCurse: Sure
 eulerscheZahl: at some point illedan struggled reaching STC legend, even complained about a boss boosted too much
 eulerscheZahl: gave him my code. he cancelled the submit at 5 points above the boss :D
 reCurse: Top 3 legend steamrolling the gold boss, what a surprise
 eulerscheZahl: top4&#160;:(
 reCurse: rip
 reCurse: Well back then :p
 eulerscheZahl: and back then i had a worse bot. and in C#
 reCurse: I dunno you need good sim and good heuristic. Usually it only requires a strong of either one.
 reCurse: Like UTTT you just need an optimized vanilla MCTS
 reCurse: Don't even need to care about understanding the game
 reCurse: Not that there's anything to understand about UTTT
 reCurse: And now saying UTTT 3 times I woke up MSmits
 reCurse: fffff
 Snef: lol
 eulerscheZahl: self-play worked surprisingly well on STC for me. param tuning
 reCurse: Well like you said opponent interaction is minimal
 eulerscheZahl: UTTT turned into countering other players rather than playing the game at the very top i think
 eulerscheZahl: adjusting opening books when losing doesn't sound that interesting to me
 reCurse: It's the perfect case against no random in initial state
 reCurse: It always ends in opening books
 Snef: well if you don't have book you can't be countered right&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: only if you have some randomness
 reCurse: You don't need to be countered if you're rank 20
 AntiSquid: in the "low ranks"
 struct: Yeah, same happened on Yavalath
 struct: same might happen on Othello
 eulerscheZahl: "might"
 struct:&#160;:(
 reCurse: There's Othello now?
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: yes, since 2 or 3 days
 eulerscheZahl: 3 approval votes, 1 refuse
 AntiSquid: the 8x8
 AntiSquid: who refused&#160;?
 Hjax: why would someone refuse it
 Scarfield: 1 refused?
 Hjax: it seemed really nice
 reCurse: Didn't think I'd reach the point where I have more unstarted multis than started ones
 reCurse: Yet here we are
 AntiSquid: maybe graphics weren't sparkling
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5106941b8347f7341a4dbe2f39dabce52586">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5106941b8347f7341a4dbe2f39dabce52586</a>
 struct: Don't worry about the refusal, me and him talked
 struct: and it's fne
 Astrobytes: It was kind-of a temporary refusal, after some discussion we got the reasoning
 struct: fine*
 reCurse: Well Othello is definitely headed that path then
 struct: also astro
 reCurse: If I was doing Chess for instance, I'd just randomize from a known opening book.
 Astrobytes: Which was nice actually
 AntiSquid: but comment section shows other rejects
 eulerscheZahl: you can write an X without refusing
 Astrobytes: No, they're trolls 
 AntiSquid: ah&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i see
 AntiSquid: that's not nice
 reCurse: Like they do in TCEC
 Hjax: TCEC is cool, it would be cool to have chess on this site, but computer chess is so overdone i feel 
 Hjax: so many strong open source programs 
 struct: So the game starts from a given position?
 reCurse: It's more for the learning experience than coding really
 Hjax: the game starts from a given intentionally unbalanced position, and the engines play both sides @struct
 reCurse: Err
 reCurse: *than competing really
 reCurse: There might be some untapped ground in the 50ms/move domain
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I find the board game stuff useful for learning
 reCurse: Who knows
 Hjax: chess is very draw heavy if you play even opening positions 
 struct: I was going to do shogi ("japanese chess") for the japanese players
 struct: But I stopped
 Astrobytes: Where are my Amazons :P
 eulerscheZahl: did i distract you? :P
 struct: I was doing amazons at the time euler
 struct: I have prototype of amazons done
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 struct: But I don't want to overflow multis
 struct: I will still release, but not as oftne
 Astrobytes: What happened to 1 per week? 
 struct: I don't think it will be good
 reCurse: You don't want to overflow multis?
 AntiSquid: 1 multi every time you reach legend in a contest struct
 reCurse: I mean...
 struct: Yeah, there are plenty already
 struct: only 3 are mine&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: 1 multi per account
 struct: I keep othello then
 AntiSquid: struct i think it's fine to add more multis if they aren't all from the same genre and more varied (no hexagon after hexagon multi)
 reCurse: No hexagon othello, reported
 reCurse: Might have been a fun variation actually :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: and how does the stone turning work on hexagon othello?
 reCurse: Same way?
 struct: well 6 directions
 AntiSquid: nvm, overthinking it, would look weird though
 struct: I should have kept othello on 24x24
 Astrobytes: Dear god no
 Scarfield: othelloTTT
 reCurse: Why stop at 24 when you can go 48
 struct: max turns&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: what's wrong with 12x12&#160;?
 struct: I think I kept 8x8 because I  asked chat
 jacek: because people wanted to easy bitboad stuff
 NaelDEV: Hello World
 Hjax: after some tweaks to my pr2 bot, its now top 20, wouldnt have changed my rank in the unofficial contest 
 Hjax: but im happy enough with it 
 Astrobytes: nice one Hjax
 Hjax: we should do more of these unofficial contests, it was pretty fun 
 Hjax: definitely motivated me to try a multi i wouldnt have otherwise
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think they'll happen
 Astrobytes: Same here, will defo go back to PR2, nice game
 Hjax: i wonder how good my pr2 bot would be at pr1 
 Hjax: they are pretty similar right?
 Astrobytes: Quite different
 Astrobytes: You have to manage pod cost and stuff
 Astrobytes: More than PR2, you have to issue buying orders
 WINWINWIN: Buy is not as big an issue as the removal of fog of war
 Astrobytes: For specific locations
 Astrobytes: And there's 'viewer issues' I believe
 WINWINWIN: The size is too low to understand anything
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm saving it for when I get *really* bored
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN where is your Othello bot
 WINWINWIN: Trying a minimax offline, will submit in a week :P
 Astrobytes: Nice&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Its my first attempt
 Astrobytes: Oh ok, it's not too hard, you'll get it quickly enough. Incorporate a/b pruning once you get the algo
 WINWINWIN: The simulation is just copy pasted from the referee, but I am trying it in python before an OOP to get it bug free
 Astrobytes: It's CG, don't need to use OOP for everything :P
 WINWINWIN: I meant an OOP lang like C/C++
 Hjax: python is an OOP language
 Astrobytes: ^
 WINWINWIN: I refer to OOP langs as langs where classes and methods are mandatory&#160;:)
 Hjax: then C isnt object oriented 
 Astrobytes: classes and methods are not mandatory in C/C++ 
 WINWINWIN: methods are not mandatory?
 swarupe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1256846968509d5be6fb92f97be064a9e3ded97">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1256846968509d5be6fb92f97be064a9e3ded97</a>
 Hjax: methods are, but classes arent 
 Hjax: you can just have free floating methods 
 Hjax: not very object oriented 
 WINWINWIN: I see, so that class Player that I used in PR2 was not necessary&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: when I refer to methods and C++ I refer to member functions
 darkhorse64: Hjax: for PR1, the ability to spawn pods change the strateegy. Will you write a PM for PR2 &lt;?
 Hjax: yeah ill write a PM 
 darkhorse64: Great, the old "Feedback" page is not very populated
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN if it helps you it's fine, it's just not mandatory&#160;;)
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: This is where Im studying the minimax
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-minimax-algorithm">https://www.baeldung.com/java-minimax-algorithm</a>
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64 same for a lot of the older multis
 WINWINWIN: Is it ok?
 struct: WINWINWIN I haven't read it, but if you want one in video.
 struct: I can link it
 jacek: it doesnt have prune array&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :D
 WINWINWIN: Can you send the video link?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI</a>
 Astrobytes: I need Prune Array for my Othello  GAimax
 Astrobytes: Woo Sebastian with his accent :D
 darkhorse64: Yeah, even PM from the top players are sometimes quite difficult to understand. Revisiting them will bring fresh ideas
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 WINWINWIN: struct is it possible to add the opponent`s move to the inputs?
 Astrobytes: RE: Searches in general, I liked the MIT lectures with Patrick Winston WINWINWIN, this series:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik</a>
 struct: What do you mean?
 struct: Put the move in the minimax functioN?
 WINWINWIN: No, I mean in the game input, give the opponents move?
 Astrobytes: Why do you need opponents last move, you have the whole board?
 struct: I wont do more changes sorry
 struct: And you can easily check with an if
 struct: what the move was
 darkhorse64: Always same reason, reuse the search tree
 WINWINWIN: Np struct, just thought that it's a more standard input
 WINWINWIN: Anyway, I will work on it this week, and submit a working version by Saturday!&#160;:)
 struct: good luck
 Astrobytes: I'll hold you to your word on that WINWINWIN :P
 WINWINWIN: :D
 WINWINWIN: gn all
 Astrobytes: gn, take it easy
 darkhorse64: In Othello, when your opponent plays several moves in a row, it's a bit hard to guess their order.
 struct: ah I see
 eulerscheZahl: why would you need it? MCTS tree reuse?
 jacek: thats a ntoher challenge
 jacek: othello has very few moves, sometimes 1. tree reusing would be useful
 darkhorse64: Yes. For the moment, I reset the tree. When you skip moves, things are bad for you
 jacek: but well, when you skip moves youre screwed anyway
 darkhorse64: ^
 Astrobytes: yeah
 struct: ok I open to discussion on this
 struct: Do you really think it's needed?
 jacek: that would be breaking change wouldnt it?
 eulerscheZahl: not necessarily
 struct: Would break current bots yes
 eulerscheZahl: see vindinium. this game has 2 protocols
 struct: How euler?
 eulerscheZahl: read the statement
 Astrobytes: EXPERT input etc
 struct: I guess I can add a message in inputs
 eulerscheZahl: If you output a debug message that contains "EXPERT_INPUT", you will get a list of opponent actions before the game input for every following turn. 
 struct: ok im gonna add this.
 struct: I'll try to add it today
 Astrobytes: Oh btw, off-topic, but I forgot to share the pleasant private message I received when I logged in this morning:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/vsrZ2HS">https://imgur.com/a/vsrZ2HS</a>
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: I have no idea who that is, but I almost spat my coffee out laughing
 eulerscheZahl: somehow the insult didnt work then
 Astrobytes: Indeed. I should reply really. Not feeling troll-y enough though
 struct: darkhorse64 if I add this, it wil only be available to read after your first output
 struct: Is this fine?
 jacek: no skipping moves happen at first move eh?
 struct: yeah, but you need to add an if in default code
 struct: if (turn &gt; N) readInput()
 darkhorse64: Yes, We should seen that before approval but I did not realized skip moves could be an issue. Otherwise, you could have implemented something like you do for Yinsh
 darkhorse64: I already have a if (turn == 1)
 struct: ok
 reCurse: Should have kept some of the DMs I get after bans
 Hjax: there was a starcraft player who cannon rushed every game, and kept a log of all of the rude things people said to him
 Hjax: it was pretty entertaining 
 Astrobytes: lol, sounds like 90s GBR-1 behaviour
 Hjax: reCurse are you pleased your pr2 bot survived the unofficial contest? 
 eulerscheZahl: i got this lovely DM once. started with "how are you?" - "fine and you?"
 eulerscheZahl: then i got insulted, then wished me a nice day
 Astrobytes: That was PayToWinGirl right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 reCurse: Only because I won't be distracted by going back to it :P
 LelouchVC2: @reCurse
 LelouchVC2: Lets play clash&#160;:)
 reCurse: You want a ban I guess?
 Hjax: bye LelouchVC2
 eulerscheZahl: you are on thin ice
 Astrobytes: byebye
 LelouchVC2: *disappears into abyss*
 eulerscheZahl: CG started working on an option to opt-out for invites. wonder how long it takes to implement
 LelouchVC2: Probably forever
 reCurse: Maybe if they said who I could spam him with invites for motivation
 LelouchVC2: If we all spam reCurse with invites, we will boost our own social standing
 eulerscheZahl: you will win a CG website without distracting chat
 Hjax: the clash spam makes me envy you guys at the top of the global leaderboard less
 reCurse: I get less of them since the new formula
 reCurse: Silver lining
 LelouchVC2: Let's change that!
 eulerscheZahl: follows are more common than clash invites actually
 eulerscheZahl: 9 new followers in the last week
 LelouchVC2: :o
 reCurse: I'm impressed how many bother with a useless feature
 eulerscheZahl: following? you can send direct messages to offline users when they follow you. and filter the leaderboard
 Hjax: the following leaderboard is pretty useful if you want to find someone quickly during a contest
 reCurse: Ah didn't know about the DM thing
 LelouchVC2: Some of these clashes are so stupid, who's accepting these?
 eulerscheZahl: that's shown at the top
 LelouchVC2: I meant it rhetorically 
 Hjax: i clash every once in a while, im not very good at the reverse ones 
 LelouchVC2: I mostly do clashes, only did 2-3 puzzles:((
 Hjax: contests are my favorite, ive struggled to find motivation to play multis 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm mostly idling in the chat
 Hjax: the unofficial contest helped 
 LelouchVC2: still salty over the broken pacman competition
 Hjax: pacman was not fun 
 LelouchVC2: It was fun while I was dominating 😂
 Hjax: i got frustrated and didnt work on my bot at all the last weekend 
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2 it's not broken?
 LelouchVC2: Astrobytes If i say broken then it's mother was also broken
 Hjax: its just designed poorly, not being able to see around corners was so annoying 
 LelouchVC2: It give me dead pacs, no way around it
 Astrobytes: Hated it. Just regular pacman with the RPS would've been fine.
 eulerscheZahl: i liked pacman in general. fog of war wasn't necessary IMO
 Astrobytes: RPS abilities that is
 Hjax: pacman with no fog of war would have been fun
 LelouchVC2: yea, abilities made it weird
 Astrobytes: Well... there's an SDK... and... y'know... don't need to *call* it pacman....
 Hjax: i wasnt a fan of OOC either, i gave up on it after an afternoon 
 reCurse: Without fog of war it would be too simple. Not saying fog of war was a good idea.
 Astrobytes: Wasn't a huge fan either Hjax but the game had merit
 LelouchVC2: Damn bro, mine was running on a simple algorithm. Didnt take long to code and was easy to expand
 Hjax: yeah i wouldnt call OOC a poorly designed game, it just wasnt something i was interested in 
 reCurse: OOC was superb but hard to get into
 LelouchVC2: I just wanted to crush opponents&#160;:((
 reCurse: I mainly say that because it's original and favored different approaches
 reCurse: Personal interest is another thing
 rahul_t37: hey hello guys
 Hjax: yeah maybe if i had stuck with it a bit longer i would have ended up enjoying it 
 Hjax: but i gave up pretty fast 
 Hjax: i think i like 10 day contests more than month long contests 
 LelouchVC2: If it's more than 1 day I'll probably forget about it
 LelouchVC2: Stuck with pacman for 3 days i think before that retrded bug
 Astrobytes: I thought the dead pacmen was an added feature?
 LelouchVC2: in a later league
 Astrobytes: So...?
 LelouchVC2: when it would give u the way to determine if it was dead
 LelouchVC2: not when u can't possibly know..
 Hjax: sure, but you didnt need to know that to silver or whatever league started giving you that info 
 Hjax: literally a completely blind pellet gobbling bot could get to silver 
 struct: I have the update ready, but I can't seem to be able to update the contribution&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: does the build not finish on the CG server?
 LelouchVC2: I cant get to silver if my program gives commands to dead pacs&#160;;)
 struct: it stays stuck on "Please wait, we are building your project..."
 LelouchVC2: hit the side of ur computer
 LelouchVC2: usually works
 eulerscheZahl: did you try waiting?
 struct: yeah
 LelouchVC2: IQ
 Hjax: its easy to tell when your own pacs were dead, the issue was when your opponents pacs were dead 
 LelouchVC2:&#160;?
 Hjax: dead pacs arent visible to you 
 Hjax: so they wouldnt get sent during your turn input 
 LelouchVC2: tell that to the bug
 eulerscheZahl: they changed that in silver
 Astrobytes: It's your bug, not the game
 LelouchVC2: its the game
 Uljahn: :face_palm:
 Hjax: i would wager the bug is in your bot, not the game, the game worked fine 
 Astrobytes: "Hover over my profile"
 LelouchVC2: I did every error check possible, reverted to previous code that worked
 LelouchVC2: i finally went through the shitty task of checking the input recieved
 LelouchVC2: and there was the dead pac, lord and behold
 eulerscheZahl: problem exists between chair and ceyboard?
 LelouchVC2: problem exists between servers and C++
 Astrobytes: *between computer and chair/char and computer
 Astrobytes: *chair
 LelouchVC2: prove me wrong
 LelouchVC2: i can show code &lt;3
 eulerscheZahl: you can be wrong without us proving
 Astrobytes: Don't show it to me, I'm not loading that game up again for a while
 LelouchVC2: I could also be God without proving it
 Hjax: i dont need to see your code to know youre wrong, my bot and everyone elses didnt crash before silver 
 Astrobytes: ^
 LelouchVC2: Who here was coding in C++
 Astrobytes: Me
 LelouchVC2: When did u get to silver?
 LelouchVC2: I joined late, i recall u joining silver before me
 Astrobytes: Fuck knows, did I get to silver?
 Astrobytes: Lemme check
 LelouchVC2: okie
 Astrobytes: I was on a lot of painkillers at the time
 Scarfield: ALWAYS assume the error is on CG's side
 LelouchVC2: sounds healthy
 LelouchVC2: i assumed it was my dumb ass, but i cant do anything if the input i get is a dead pac
 Scarfield: type "DEAD" ..
 struct: Is 15 minutes a reasonable waiting time?
 Astrobytes: Nope. Stayed in bronze. I gave up early-ish I believe
 LelouchVC2: type: "DEAD" is in silver
 eulerscheZahl: 15min is too long
 struct: Guess I'll report it on discord
 Hjax: type dead only helps you know if your opponents pacs are dead, you can tell if your own pacs are dead from the inputs without the dead type 
 struct: I also tried for a new contribution
 struct: same happens
 LelouchVC2: The inputs have the dead pacs..
 Astrobytes: ffs
 RoboStac: they didn't, or everyone would crash
 LelouchVC2: funny
 RoboStac: as they did when they got to silver
 Hjax: yeah silver broke everyone for a while 
 Hjax: was kind of amusing 
 LelouchVC2: They fixeed the bug
 LelouchVC2: i just ran my code, and it no longer calls dead pacs, i didn't touch it
 LelouchVC2: So if i havent touched this code since dead pacs being called pissed me off
 LelouchVC2: did my code magically rewrite itself
 LelouchVC2: or did they fix the bug?&#160;;)
 RoboStac: you can see on github exactly what they changed and when
 Astrobytes: RoboStac, any plans for Othello?
 RoboStac: not atm
 Astrobytes: Working on anything else interesting?
 RoboStac: nah, mostly just playing actual games rather than coding
 struct: darkhorse64 I have the code ready, I just need to be able to upload. The input will be given after the for loop of the board and will give all player previous actions that you did not get, you will also get passes
 Astrobytes: heh, downtime is always good&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Great
 Astrobytes: What flavour of MCTS darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64: vanilla
 Astrobytes: Really? Have you tried with EPT or any other domain-knowledge flavours?
 LelouchVC2: damn, forgot about me real quick
 darkhorse64: No, I am focusing on getting the fastest possible engine
 Astrobytes: Fair play
 darkhorse64: Eval will come after
 Astrobytes: Do you know how deep tric and other alphabeta's go by any chance?
 Astrobytes: Oh he's online, trictrac, what's your max depth?
 darkhorse64: No idea. I see that usually tric trac finds the game outcome 2 to 4 plies before me
 Astrobytes: He's got a helluva bot
 darkhorse64: He is busy extending his lead
 Astrobytes: So I see
 trictrac: don't know really
 trictrac: but I print WIN or LOSE when I see the end
 struct: tric trac see what I typed to darkhorse, it might be usefull
 struct: It's not uploaded yet.
 Astrobytes: lol, this is still your alphabeta trictrac?
 trictrac: yes
 Astrobytes: Nice, very nice.
 darkhorse64: 20 years refining the code
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: He's a master for sure
 trictrac: I am trying to do a best eval but it seems not so good
 trictrac: against LeRenard
 darkhorse64: He has a 30 years old bot
 LelouchVC2: The classics never die
 Astrobytes: *Modified 30 years bot
 darkhorse64: distilled
 Astrobytes: I still love that though. Epic code reuse.
 LelouchVC2: If it's not in C++ it's not a real bot
 Astrobytes: It's C++ and quit the trolling attempts, we're bigger trolls than you :P
 LelouchVC2: I was trolling before u were born
 Astrobytes: I see.
 darkhorse64: I use C++ for auto, lambda and STL. That spares lots of typing.  Almost never use inheritance for my bots. Some overloading for vector class
 LelouchVC2: u made ur own vector class?
 Astrobytes: The lambdas are great
 Astrobytes: Ofc LelouchVC2, standard on here
 darkhorse64: CG does not provide one
 LelouchVC2: nice, i wrote my own map class
 LelouchVC2: because CG only gave me std::map
 darkhorse64: I don't mind you are wasting your time
 LelouchVC2: :oo
 Astrobytes: Lemme guess, std::map is bugged 
 LelouchVC2: definitely, i once tried to output the 10th element
 LelouchVC2: and it threw and out of bounds error, like wtf?
 Astrobytes: trolololol
 struct: Should rewrite c++
 Astrobytes: Any luck with the update yet struct, or still stuck?
 struct: stuck
 Astrobytes: damn
 struct: Even on new contributions it gets stuck
 struct: I posted on discord, but won't ping
 Scarfield: othello update incomming?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, too late for a ping
 struct: Yes,  I will give optional last actions made by opponent
 Astrobytes: Yeah, no breaking changes though OthelloField
 struct: Should have seen this before
 struct: but oh well
 Scarfield: uuh nice, considered asking for it, but thought nah, other games here doesnt either
 Astrobytes: Never occurred to me tbh
 struct: As it was said, it can be good for passes
 Astrobytes: yep
 Hjax: i think trictrac is about to dethrone lerenard in othello
 Astrobytes: He was already first HJax
 Hjax: oh was he?
 Astrobytes: By a stretch yeah :D
 Hjax: just trying to widen his 1st place margin?
 Scarfield: he mentioned ealier his eval wasnt the best
 Hjax: i dont win 100% of my games, bot sucks
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: I think he was 3 pts above previously?
 darkhorse64: My last battles Games 225 to 240, trictrac-darkhorse64: 1-0
 Scarfield: dont know, but no.1 for sure
 Astrobytes: I don't know anything after today, my head is a mess of bitshifts
 DaFish: for neuron in brain: neuron = 0
 jacek: astro8bits
 PkZ: Is anyone else getting network errors?
 Astrobytes: Yes DaFish :D
 Astrobytes: astro64 jacek, please
 Scarfield: AstroFloat
 Astrobytes: Doesn't really rhyme with any brain cells though ArmWield
 Scarfield: True, let me play this small Fiddle CastroInt :p
 DiL: @PkZ I also got network errors
 Astrobytes: haha well played :D
 Astrobytes: Are you MCTS as well jacek?
 jacek: not yet
 Astrobytes: How deep's your a/b?
 jacek: 6-7 plies in middle game
 Scarfield: bit boarding?
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: ofc
 Astrobytes: I can get about 10 in middle game, but my eval is shit
 Astrobytes: *up to 10
 jacek: wanna see my eval?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/raw/AEwcLFGW">https://pastebin.com/raw/AEwcLFGW</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah don't hit me with myStones - hisStones
 Scarfield: we dont want to see you evaluate no :p
 Astrobytes: lel
 Astrobytes: Yeah, at least he didn't show us his ejaculation function
 DiL: are reverse mode clashes broken? I got networ errors when loading test...
 Scarfield: its not recursive, but reciprocate
 Astrobytes: That just means it's time to quit clashing and play multis DiL
 Astrobytes: hahaha ScarFeel
 DiL: Astrobytes is there a limit to clashes I can play?
 JBM: not that we know
 JBM: how many *have* you played?
 Scarfield: at some point you will get captchas afaik, but i dont think there is a limit
 DiL: many!
 JBM: wow that's a LOT
 Scarfield: many factorial :o
 DiL: captchas is ok, I just got network errors...
 Scarfield: apperently you are not alone with that currently, a few others have mentioned it&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Sorry DiL I was trolling&#160;:)Someone else was mentioning network errors for clashes earlier, might be a server issue
 Astrobytes: AstroRecites strikes again
 Scarfield: xD
 DiL: ok, fine. time to stop playing clashes! thanks
 Astrobytes: Puzzles are always waiting&#160;:)
 jacek: just invite some toads to clashes
 Scarfield: puzzles and multies are great DiL, if you havent checked them out yet, i can highly recommend it&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/473003466">https://www.codingame.com/replay/473003466</a>
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Hjax: i like how he just prints out LOSE when he sees the loss
 jacek: and he saw that 4 plies before my did
 Hjax: you still found the right moves though 
 Hjax: so its ok 
 Astrobytes: lol nice jacek
 Hjax: it would be depressing if he printed LOSE, and then a few moves later he was printing WIN 
 Astrobytes: Or Smits-style - Turn 2: Solved I win
 Scarfield: maybe he only prints LOSE if its a certain loss, but that would be sad yea
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: smits beats you in book 
 Astrobytes: Not just book, depends on the game I guess. But he's bloody good at it!
 Hjax: i havent played any true number crunchy games yet 
 jacek: but only in the opening
 Hjax: i dont think im very good at them 
 jacek: number crunchy games?
 Hjax: search heavy games 
 jacek: o
 Hjax: i keep saying ill use one as an excuse to learn C++ or Rust 
 Hjax: but i have not yet done that 
 Astrobytes: Not just number crunching really
 Astrobytes: Do it
 Astrobytes: Honestly, the more knowledge the better if you ask me
 struct: There are plenty of games for this
 struct: But from all of them I would stay away from UTTT
 Astrobytes: I've still not got around to it, it just seems repellent :D
 struct: Yavalath bots are hard
 struct: I mean top bots
 Hjax: we should do yavalath as the next unofficial contest 
 Hjax: it would make structs year 
 Astrobytes: lol, 100 signups, 2 participants
 struct: :D
 struct: It would be hard to beat lot of top players
 struct: MSmits spent months on it
 struct: I mentioned him more, because he talked a lot about it
 Astrobytes: Hm, Agade is online, Agade, what did you change in your NN recently for Oware?
 struct: jace k also made an article on it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/46262/on-generating-opening-book-for-yavalath-mcts-bot">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/46262/on-generating-opening-book-for-yavalath-mcts-bot</a>
 struct: Seems like I won't be able to update othello today
 struct: I'll do it tomorrow
 Astrobytes: Could be issues on their end, I'm sure they'll sort it out
 struct: yeah, it's fine
 jacek: sounds clashy
 struct: What do you mean jacek?
 struct: What is clashy?
 Agade: I had some bugs in the learning but improvements on the MCTS side make the bulk of the ranking gain
 jacek: clashes are having some problems too, no?
 Agade: e.g. was not preserving tree from turn to turn
 struct: ah, no idea
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, yes, that's helpful indeed. Good work Agade&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: struct, I don't know what others think but I would have broken the 22 existing bots without mercy. One more line in the inputs "previousMoves". To unbreak the bot, just read this new line. No more changes needed. Frankly, it's not a big deal 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's only 1 resubmit away
 jacek: blame those who approved it
 Astrobytes: shut it jacek&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I did not but I failed to see the problem so I think I am also to blame. Things went so fast that I did not have time to write a real bot
 Astrobytes: But yeah, just one line change is not a big issue, just resubmit after
 Astrobytes: No I didn't have a full bot either, I'd started but was more focused on whether the game was working properly
 darkhorse64: It's not like we are in the middle of a contest with 5k players
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Either way, CG is not letting him update the game atm so we'll have to wait
 jacek: yinsh curse?
 Astrobytes: lol, hopefully not!
 darkhorse64: Hence my post. After some thoughts, I believe it's better to have simple inputs rather than preserve compatibility at all costs
 darkhorse64: When I was doing breakthrough, I had the same issues
 Astrobytes: I've still not done BT, I promise I will soon
 Astrobytes: Hey did anyone see the post on latest post in the Othello topic in the forum?
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure I understand. I don't use the list of possible actions for a start.
 Astrobytes: *see the latest post
 darkhorse64: Soem believe that writing a bot is rand()%actionsCount
 darkhorse64: *Some*
 jacek: if you print the last possible action, youll print the same move for the same game
 jacek: actually thats better than random in yinsh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's how I test contributions or submit a basic bot so I can test and write a decent bot.
 darkhorse64: For yinsh, output the longest action
 Astrobytes: Yeah, something like that
 jacek: the True AI
 Astrobytes: I think I did some sorting based on something
 Astrobytes: I need to write a proper Yinsh bot, I like that game a lot
 Astrobytes: So many games
 jacek: like not-rock football
 Astrobytes: Yeah I'll get to paper soccer too :P
 Astrobytes: Nice re-phrasing btw
 Astrobytes: Do you think my forum response is OK? 
 darkhorse64: It is
 Astrobytes: I mean, any non-stochastic algo versus anything hardcoded will be the same right? And any hardcodes are gonna be the same against a hardcode.
 Astrobytes: thanks darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: I have done some googling. There are huge opening and endgame books for Othello
 Astrobytes: I saw a little bit about some databases earlier but not much (was heavily shifting bits) - useful in CG context?
 darkhorse64: Fortunately, there are huge. Dump in CG context is not doable
 Astrobytes: Hallelujah
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Could be some interesting stuff in there though
 Astrobytes: I see, massive computer generated and also a bunch of human books too
 darkhorse64: I have not much experience in the game but It seems you cannot lose in the first turns (like Y). So you must go deep 
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a lot more open at the beginning
 Astrobytes: Maybe I'll just use the human books and some ifs. True AI.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for tonight, gn/bn all
 Hjax: ok i posted my PR2 post mortem 
 Hjax: tldr: munkres good algo
 darkhorse64: For the scoring function, distance is distance to what&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Nice post, bt
 darkhorse64: btw
 Hjax: distance between the pod im scoring and the target 
 Hjax: its just a big 2d array
 Hjax: all of my pods vs all of my targets 
 darkhorse64: so you are planning ahead (for several turns)
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Hjax: i dont store the munkres results, but in theory the mapping doesnt change much 
 darkhorse64: I mean, you are not looking only to the nearest neighbours
 Hjax: i am not 
 Hjax: i have a global list of targets that i assign my pods to 
 Hjax: the targets are just seen but not visited squares, and any square my opponent owns 
 Hjax: so munkres finds the most efficient mapping between all of my pods and all of those targets 
 darkhorse64: I think I got it: you remember tiles not visited or tiles owned by enemy even if you don't see them anymore
 darkhorse64: Thanks
 Hjax: yeah 
 Hankdane: They also have unordered_map.
 Hankdane: Doh, replied to an earlier thread.&#160;:-/
 Reksio: Hi all. I see that some puzzles ignore code speed. Do you know how should I know when it matters and when not as well as other criteria?
 Pooshlmer: As far as I know, you find out when you timeout
 Hankdane: Usually there are hints in the description.
 Hankdane: I have yet to be surprised about seeing a timeout.
 Reksio: so O(N) and similar requirements for speed and memory do not matter here much? Also usage of Linq (C#) vs not using it. Linq can often slow down the code.
 Reksio: Also I honestly didn't know that looking at hints does not destroy your score.
 Hankdane: Oh, I didn't mean the hints specifically, sorry. I meant the main description.
 Hankdane: I haven't looked at hints, so dunno what it does to score.
 Hankdane: If the problem is not speed related, code performance will not impact your score either way.
 Hankdane: That's been my experience, at least.
 Hankdane: What I meant by 'hint' is just to say it may not specifically say 'your code will time out if it is too slow,' but it will contain some kind of speed requirement.
 Reksio: I hope they could bullet point in the future what is important to the solution and what's not. Speed, memory, code size after compilation, etc.
 Reksio: But thanks for sharing your experience. Maybe I will visit forums for each puzzle before I try to solve them next time.
 jvke: Does Clash of Code rate solutions by their efficiency as well as time completed? I finished 3rd in terms of time but ended up getting first
 Pooshlmer: There's 3 modes
 Pooshlmer: Two are fastest time, but "shortest code" looks for the smallest code size
 jvke: Ah, thanks
 jrke: Het jvke my id name is jrke :smiley:
 jrke: *hey
 Hjax: huh i just poked my pr2 bot a bit 
 Hjax: and now its rank 12 
 WINWINWIN: Anyone, when you are writing a minimax, it just needs to be a constant sum, not a zero sum right?
 Hjax: what do you mean constant sum?

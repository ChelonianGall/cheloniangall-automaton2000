 Jean-Paul: :grimacing:
 ubaire: Did you heard about the claustrophibic astronaut&#160;? He's just needed some space 
 Switch64: How do you put out a baby from a mixer&#160;? With a straw *
 PeyoakaJesus: my little died in a mixer it's not funny
 PeyoakaJesus: brother
 Jean-Paul: :cold_sweat:
 MadKnight: what is going on here
 Switch64: How do you call a dwarf that works at the THE POST&#160;: A dwarfposter
 MadKnight: calm down Switch64
 Switch64: Sorry sorry we are between friends having fun in class 
 Switch64: it's pretty hard to be honest
 MadKnight: u can just go to a private class
 Switch64: (that was she said)
 MadKnight: chat
 MadKnight: class chat
 ubaire: What does the left eye says to the right eye&#160;? Something spells here 
 MadKnight: #switchchat
 ubaire: Between us 
 Jean-Paul: MadKnight is the Impostor
 MadKnight: everyone click #switchchat
 ubaire: THANK YOU 
 Jean-Paul: vote MadKnight
 Switch64: ty you are the best 
 PeyoakaJesus: GOD BLEES YOU
 Switch64: better than BlaiseEbuth 
 PeyoakaJesus: BEST MODO EVER

 ubaire: Everybody move to #switchchat to have fun w/ is 
 ubaire: us
 ubaire: you are a better modo than blaiseebuth
 Jean-Paul: ty
 JSboss: ya he is a bit of a tyrant
 BlaiseEbuth: Something to say&#160;?
 MadKnight: BlaiseTyranth
 CodingCommander03: in csb will the score reset every time in test in arena&#160;?
 MadKnight: right
 MadKnight: when u submit it starts all over again
 CodingCommander03: okay thanks
 derjack: who cares about csb
 MadKnight: yea exactly
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's play some graph games
 Automaton2000: dont want to know that
 Jean-Paul: MadKnight&gt;BlaiseEbuth
 MadKnight: dude u won't hurt his feelings with that
 derjack: graph games? like hypersonic?
 MadKnight: no that's a grid
 BlaiseEbuth: A grid is peculiar graph
 BlaiseEbuth: +a
 MadKnight: it's about optimizing grids to the point where it's just a int128
 MadKnight: and all that grid-related stuff
 MadKnight: BlaiseEbuth are u not upset about our old fight anymore?
 BlaiseEbuth: I will not ignore you on public chat...
 ubaire: Be cool guys 
 MadKnight: well good enough
 ubaire: Why did Mr. Hass refuse to move to France? The French are famous for not pronouncing the letter ‘H’.
 Automaton2000: is it possible to get that with a simple ga
 MadKnight: ubaire #switchchat
 ubaire: #switchchat
 VizGhar: Which puzzle/bot contest you recommend for GA?
 MadKnight: single player actually
 BlaiseEbuth: code vs zombie
 MadKnight: and where the late moves don't depend on the early moves
 MadKnight: because y'know
 MadKnight: in most games if u change early moves
 MadKnight: all the future moves just break
 MadKnight: well CvZ not perfect but pretty good
 derjack: :soccer:
 Uljahn: Marslander ep.2/3 could be a good choice with simulation being easy enough, also there are some blog posts about implementing GA in marslander
 Jean-Paul: x
 MadKnight: now that's an actually good suggestion
 MadKnight: Jean-Paul i hope u are not trying to get banned in here too? after #fr
 Jean-Paul: nop
 MadKnight: okay cool
 MadKnight: wow
 MadKnight: RuthlessEbuth
 MadKnight: RuthlessTyranth
 BlaiseEbuth: He insult me on the chan you created for them. So he can stay there
 derjack: MadBlaise
 derjack: the ultimate insult
 AntiSquid: oh daporan actually made it to first, it didn't look good last i checked and thought pb had a strong NN, neuman 2nd :o
 Lucie-Fer: :thumbsdown_tone2:
 BlaiseEbuth: Problem ubaire&#160;?
 Lucie-Fer: My name is LUCYFER
 MadKnight: dude #switchchat
 BlaiseEbuth: Cool
 Lucie-Fer: You're Belzebuth I'm Lucifer, we're bros
 MadKnight: i think he's gonna ban u now
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact my alt account was named Lucie Faire
 Lucie-Fer: Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
 VizGhar: I already have simulator for mars-lander implemented 100% correctly... I'll try to use it there
 Lucie-Fer: Can smbdy help me on Power of Thor pls 
 MadKnight: oh that's good VizGhar
 Lucie-Fer: I'm kinda stuck here 
 MadKnight: can u explain the problem
 MadKnight:&#160;?
 VizGhar: try hint on the left Lucie-Fer or ask what exactly you need
 Lucie-Fer: Got it&#160;!! 
 Lucie-Fer: Thank you all for your kindness 
 Lucie-Fer: God bless you guys
 MadKnight: no problem
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 where's my CodinPoints for helping 
 Automaton2000: i don't know how to install it
 Westicles: Happy Ambedkar Jayanti Day
 MadKnight: what is even that day?
 AntiSquid: ya, not even google celebrates it
 jrke: indian celebrates it i mean just by wishing
 jrke: he was the father of our constitution
 AntiSquid: are you Indian or partially Indian Westicles&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or is your wife indian?
 Westicles: No, robinhood was telling me about it
 Westicles: I guess they all have the day off
 Westicles: Everything I know about India is from the movie Sholay
 jrke: :smiley:
 VizGhar: is robinhood some kind of meme? I don't recall seeing anybody with this name here
 VizGhar: but he is mentioned quite often
 jrke: robinhood is codingamer remains active in indian chat as far as i know
 AntiSquid: VizGhar, he made multiple accounts with similar name, got banned multiple times, keeps create new accounts
 VizGhar: :D how can you get banned here ffs? And why would you come back... people are strange
 Westicles: I got banned once, almost twice to be honest
 jrke: i haven't banned yet
 jrke: lucky&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Strange Westicles... :thinking:
 AntiSquid: multiple reasons, constant spam, swear words out of the blue VizGhar, repetitive messages that are completely pointless for example ... but he was also trolling a bit more than that
 AntiSquid: i don't know what others ban for, might include being politically incorrect i guess, nothing i deal with though
 Mil27Coder: hi
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 jrke: i still remember i was one of the spammer during spring challenge 2020 cause i was new to coding and codingame
 AntiSquid: depends what you see as spam
 derjack: i never got banned o.O
 AntiSquid: never too late
 BlaiseEbuth: I can fix that for you.
 Mil27Coder: can someone help learn js
 AntiSquid: put more effort in it derjack, especially if it's an alt account which is not allowed to begin with
 ErrorRazor: Mil27Coder here you go: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=javascript+tutorial&amp;ia=web">https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=javascript+tutorial&amp;ia=web</a>
 AntiSquid: jrke i see regulars spam too, it's more about not being obnoxious when you do it, but there are also double standards i've seen, school kids who join as a group occasionally got kicked / banned for the same thing regulars did without side-effects ... 
 VizGhar: I have one alt account, just for showing my students first 2-3 puzzles :P
 AntiSquid: there's the argument school kids are less predictable
 jrke: ohkay
 AntiSquid: what were your spam messages anyway jrke&#160;?
 AntiSquid: asking questions / help isn't spam @_@
 jrke: like keep asking every moment for advices
 jrke: i was asking for help but very frequent messages
 AntiSquid: isn't that normal if you're new?
 jrke: hmmm....
 AntiSquid: if it's "can i ask a question" then ... oof
 AntiSquid: actually people do that a lot in real life! :D
 AntiSquid: even when it's clear i am there to help them 
 ErrorRazor: Interesting potw

 Matrix007: hello guys...
 Matrix007: i have a doubt
 Matrix007: in Horse -racing duals
 Matrix007: two test cases seems to satisfy it but the third test case shows somehting totally different
 Matrix007: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d71b5f9-0e75-4a7c-acd6-93741aa6d58b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d71b5f9-0e75-4a7c-acd6-93741aa6d58b</a>
 Matrix007: idk where i am making the mistake:upside_down:
 ErrorRazor: for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
 ErrorRazor: crash*
 ErrorRazor: unless inp[N] points to diff[0] since they're declared together, idk how that works
 Matrix007: oh yah...it must crash right??....but how does it work??
 Matrix007: i dont know my code:no_mouth:
 ErrorRazor: Try printing inp[N] and see what's in there
 Uljahn: ye, it works with i &lt; N -1 and diff[N-1]
 ErrorRazor: The sorting can be simplified btw, just do sort(inp, inp + N)
 Matrix007: it prints the garbage value .....thats what messed me up in the last case
 Matrix007: i just saw the hint it says to simplify the number of comparisons...
 Matrix007: as it clearly defines that my logic will not work in the long run
 Uljahn: the second sorting could be replaced with finding minimum i guess
 ErrorRazor: I got 100% with python, so you should be good
 Matrix007: i will try:thumbsup:
 ErrorRazor: I never realized there was a hints button lmao
 Uljahn: that button is quite rare, only 4 or 5 puzzles have it
 ErrorRazor: Ah okay
 Hamza_Abdelal: hiiiiiiiiiiii
 AntiSquid: how many alts are you going to make robin_hood&#160;? kinda boring really
 derjack: why would anyone create an alt here
 BlaiseEbuth: For glory&#160;!
 AntiSquid: to replay lower leagues
 IshaanJ: hi
 Rudrigo: hello friends
 ensamblador: hi
 Butanium: hi
 ThatGuyRadnii: People smurf CodinGame?
 struct: nah
 ZarthaxX: struct does
 struct: yes
 Auto2552: BSOD
 BlaiseEbuth: HCF
 struct: Finally found how to cast binary values of __m256 to __m256i
 ZarthaxX: how so :P
 ZarthaxX: doesnt seem hard
 struct: Is there an instruction for it?
 ZarthaxX: i mean they are the same registers
 ZarthaxX: low level wise
 heloche: howdy
 pb4: struct&#160;: what does that mean&#160;?
 pb4: Are you speaking about the equivalent of a reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;()&#160;?
 struct: 10.0f = 01000001001000000000000000000000
 struct: binary
 struct: which equals 1092616192
 pb4: so that's a reinterpret cast
 pb4: What's your solution&#160;?
 struct: _mm256_cvtepi32_ps(*(__m256i*)(&amp;x))
 struct: x being a __m256
 pb4: wow
 pb4: I think I struggled on this question some time ago
 pb4: But I don't remember having that many steps in the solution
 pb4: But it seems I don't use it anymore in my latest engine, I don't know where I'd find what I used
 struct: So there should be a shorter way?
 pb4: I might be mistaken, maybe I was using m128 at the time
 struct: It converts back to __m256 though
 struct: the binary equivalent is the just the *(__m256i*)(&amp;x)
 struct: But there might be a better way, im not really good with avx
 pb4: I'm looking through my old engines
 pb4: They were _m128
 pb4: I have this somewhere
 pb4: #define v4i_to_v4f(a) (_mm_castsi128_ps(a))
 pb4: I beilieve all those are reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;()
 struct: you are right
 struct: _mm256_castps_si256
 struct: does the same&#160;:/
 struct: Dont know how I missed it
 struct: Thanks
 pb4: I'm finding this&#160;: __m256 _mm256_castsi256_ps (__m256i a)
 pb4: Yeah, other way around
 struct: Thanks for the help
 pb4: It's easy to miss, the search engine on the intel intrinsics guide isn't the best...
 pb4: Do you use other resources when looking for intrinsics&#160;?
 struct: Only this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/vectorclass/version2">https://github.com/vectorclass/version2</a>
 struct: and intel intrinsics site
 ZarthaxX: wow
 ZarthaxX: did you see the _mm256_castps_si256 description struct?
 ZarthaxX: it's just a compiled thing as at low level its all the same hehe
 pb4: Thanks&#160;!
 pb4: Yeah that's the reinterpret_cast ZarthaxX&#160;:)
 pb4: very different from static_cast
 ZarthaxX: but that one is not for intrinsics only right?
 pb4: reinterpret_cast and static_cast are for scalar values
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 ZarthaxX: never used any, thanks for that, will look it up :o
 pb4: static_cast is the basic cast
 struct: Now I will try again what I talked with you the last time ZarthaxX, I never managed to do it.
 struct: Get index of highest value of __m256
 ZarthaxX: i have code for that
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: but not for yout type of data
 ZarthaxX: talk with me on pm if you want
 pb4: So it's the argmax you need&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: yes he needs that
 struct: yes
 pb4: Curious about your solution&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: get index of max value in a simd reg
 ZarthaxX: i have the power of 2 solution here
 pb4: uh&#160;?
 struct: I think  he means he has 2 solutions for it
 ZarthaxX: mmm
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6a3c53f-ac65-48df-8dca-af307b84aee2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6a3c53f-ac65-48df-8dca-af307b84aee2</a>
 ZarthaxX: that one is for 256
 ZarthaxX: short values
 ZarthaxX: did you mean that struct?
 ZarthaxX: SIMDreg is just a struct 
 ZarthaxX: i can explain it, but basically it's just taking the max between pairs, then between pairs of pairs bla bla
 ZarthaxX: that's why i said the power of 2 solution
 ZarthaxX:  union SIMDreg{
 ZarthaxX: struct want some explanation?
 ThatGuyRadnii: Is the CodinGame Get A Job feature actually useful?
 struct: ZarthaxX I think you explained it to me before
 struct: on discord
 Smelty: hi
 ZarthaxX: and you didnt get it
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 pb4: Didn't know that solution ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: i need to voice chat with you lol
 pb4: I have a different one
 ZarthaxX: yours is simpler i guess
 pb4: Nah
 ZarthaxX: you are a master
 ZarthaxX: oh
 ZarthaxX: but did you understand mine? its hard as there isnt a context
 ZarthaxX: missing some variables declarations
 pb4: Same idea to permute the solutions to have only the maximum value at the end
 ZarthaxX: the idea is simple
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 struct: for(int i = 0; i &lt; 8; ++i)
 struct: easy
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 pb4: but I take a mask each time
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 pb4: I apply the mask twice 
 pb4: once to the values
 pb4: once to a vector of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4....
 ZarthaxX: isnt it more expensive? :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: my solution was explained here
 pb4: and in the end, my vector of 0, 1, 2, 3, ... contains 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3... if 3 was the argmax
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/634216430883045402/809574333390913546/unknown.png?width=733&amp;height=454">https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/634216430883045402/809574333390913546/unknown.png?width=733&amp;height=454</a>
 ZarthaxX: an example of what is happenning
 ZarthaxX: ah pb4 ok
 ZarthaxX: i did that broadcast for finding the index later
 ZarthaxX: do you apply a mask to the vector to put the intermediate max values pb4&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Marchete: why AVX?
 ZarthaxX: why not
 ZarthaxX: i dont really get that question
 Smelty: hi
 ZarthaxX: hello
 Marchete: what kind of code to use AVX?
 ZarthaxX: ask struct
 Marchete: I did, see "why AVX?"
 groksula: i read that declarative programming is good
 groksula: at least in js
 groksula: map instead of loops
 groksula: but its way slower to run, by factor of x100s sometimes
 groksula: why is it better?
 ZarthaxX: Marchete but tag him lol
 struct: if i have a __m256 should I use avx to find max value?
 struct: or max value index
 struct: shouldnt*
 ZarthaxX: yep
 ZarthaxX: it's ok
 Marchete: max value inside it?
 ZarthaxX: i think he is asking why do you have that m256
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: Marchete yup
 struct: yes
 Marchete: what are you doing with AVX? just curious
 struct: Im going back to csb
 struct: to finish it
 Marchete: aaargh
 <b>**Marchete runs away</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct:&#160;:(
 Marchete: jk good luck
 dominik-pm: man forgot the return haha
 ZarthaxX: puto Marchete
 Marchete: I think NN and these approaches beat the raw power of sim with AVX
 struct: Yeah
 struct: AVX stands no chance vs NNs
 struct: at least the tops ones
 struct: I mostly do this for fun
 ZarthaxX: leave the optim guy alone
 ZarthaxX: :C
 Marchete: ok, if it's for fun and learning it's good
 ZarthaxX: and bullying you sir
 ZarthaxX: struct you doing it&#160;? :thinking:
 struct: Im going to try it yes
 ZarthaxX: aight
 ZarthaxX: tell me if you need smth
 struct: thanks
 Marchete: struct
 Marchete: do you want code?
 Marchete: I maybe have some oold ancient code
 Marchete: it had GA, go figure...
 struct: Well, it would save my brain
 ZarthaxX: i threw him code too&#160;:(
 Marchete: not a working bot
 Marchete: just the sim
 ZarthaxX: ah for csb
 ZarthaxX: meh
 struct: ah no
 struct: I guess I could check
 struct: I like to read others code
 struct: I always learn something
 Marchete: "I like to read others code" I doubt in that case
 Marchete: hmm
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gist.github.com/marchete/1db9319be7a134560e0c87e41affbb7d">https://gist.github.com/marchete/1db9319be7a134560e0c87e41affbb7d</a>
 Marchete: enjoy the pain
 Marchete: play against yourself
 Marchete: last line will give you the sim accuracy
 Marchete: Fails/Over/Turn:0/0/413
 struct: I read your pcr code
 struct: wasnt that bad :p
 Marchete: means no failed turns
 Marchete: ahh, it's true
 struct: Thanks I will check it out
 Marchete: #define SIMLOG is the switch to enable the simulation test
 Marchete: anyways nothing else was completed
 Marchete: but sim seemed OK
 struct: Same situation for me on my csb code
 struct: I finished sim but never finished ai
 Marchete: for ideas about AVX, better go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/vectorclass/version2/blob/master/vectorf256.h">https://github.com/vectorclass/version2/blob/master/vectorf256.h</a>
 Marchete: That's Agner's Fog vector class
 Marchete: a very good one
 Marchete: with many tricks
 Marchete: STI v8 max(P8fab){return _mm256_max_ps(a,b);}
 Marchete: you don't need tricks for max float
 pb4: Marchete is that that parallel engine&#160;?
 pb4: 8 games in parallel&#160;?
 struct: yes pb4
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: in PCR doesn't work
 Marchete: it just explodes
 Marchete: so many collisions that delta time drift
 Marchete: unreliable
 Marchete: in CSB it seems better
 struct: That max is not what I really want
 Marchete: ahh
 struct: I want max index from a single __m256
 struct: of the highest value there
 struct: In csb it also did fine for me
 struct: you seem to have higher average of sims though
 pb4: What are you working on struct
 pb4:&#160;?
 struct: csb
 Smelty: ohh
 Marchete: csb sim with AVX + what kind of search?
 struct: I was going to try smitsi anyways, but I think the gains will be negligible
 struct: I dont think there is a way to properly use it with mcts
 struct: It will be all over the place
 EliTheCoder: that's a lot of acronyms
 pb4: struct you're making a "8 games in parallel" engine too&#160;?
 struct: yes
 pb4: or an "8 times faster" engine&#160;?
 struct: 8 times parallel
 struct: I already have one
 struct: But never finished AI for it
 pb4: 8 times parallel feels hard to use
 struct: Is the  "8 times faster" good?
 struct: and how does it work?
 pb4: "8 times faster" is obviously not really 8 times faster, but close enough
 struct: So it might be even better than 8 times parallel
 pb4: As for "good", it's convenient because you can use it just like a non-SIMD parallel
 pb4: *engine
 struct: So it makes a single game N times faster?
 pb4: Yes
 struct: ok, that is way more benefitial than 8 times parallel
 pb4:&#160;:)
 struct: Now I need to find how to do it :D
 pb4: haha
 pb4: Look at a normal CSB engine
 pb4: Where is the bottleneck&#160;?
 struct: collisions?
 pb4: more specifically&#160;?
 pb4: Finding the next collision&#160;? Applying the collision that was found&#160;?
 struct: I think it was applying
 struct: maybe not due to all the math inside next collision
 struct: Well I would say its next collision
 struct: You calculate it way more often
 pb4: so

 pb4:&#160;:)
 ErrorRazor: Have you guys tried printing the inputs for all pods into error stream, then scraping replay data and teaching a neural network based on those inputs and outputs instead of using GA?
 struct: So you calculate all the collisions at once?
 pb4: two steps for all collisions
 struct: I see
 pb4: I could probably do one-step for all pod-pod collisions and a simpler step for pod-cp collisions
 pb4: but I do two steps for all pod-pod AND pod-cp collisions
 struct: its 10 collisions total right?
 jrke: yes
 pb4: Yes
 jrke: 6 + 4
 jrke: 6 pod and pod, 4 pod and Cp
 jrke: i just discovered one of my major bug in SLCC code
 jrke: the bug is in Pod and Cp collison i was taking Cp as pod with radius 600 and vx = vy =0 but forgot about its mass
 Alexhasapython: :disappointed:
 struct: Thanks for the tips pb4
 jrke: btw way struct with evaluation update and 2-3 more changes in inorry CSB starter you gan get top legend
 pb4: haha
 pb4: So your pods bounced on the CP&#160;?&#160;:)
 jrke: yes in slcc i just discovered in my mind that i forgot about CP mass and bouncing
 pb4: Did you use inoryy's starter&#160;?
 jrke: not now

 KelvinAndHubbles: Why does the leagues have the "Promoting in X seconds" thingy where you have to wait?
 KelvinAndHubbles: Is it so you dont get promoted off of like temporary success?
 AntiSquid: you mean trying to demoralize you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: nah it's just a weird feature that's all
 jacek: probably something with preventing server overload?
 Westicles: There is an EU law that was put in place after all those WoW players died from bladder explosions

 ShannonNorris97: Has anyone done Nuggets numbers who can explain the problem differently to me please? I keep looking at the goal and the test cases, but I just don't understand what the puzzle is asking
 jacek: that puzzle is so last week
 BlaiseEbuth: Just eat all the nuggets. No more chicken, no more problem.
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah I first looked at it last week when it was puzzle of the week, but wasn't sure about it, so I've just come back to it
 jacek: you dont know what to do, or you dont know how to do it
 AntiSquid: is your avatar suffering from vaccine side effects? 
 ShannonNorris97: I don't know what the puzzle is asking. So it says it wants the maximal nuggets its impossible to get. So even on the first test case where the portion sizes are 2 and 5, the answer is 3. Why not 1? You can't get 1 nugget
 jacek: it asks about maximum
 jacek: you cant get 1 and 3. 3 is maximum
 ShannonNorris97: That's a good point haha, so why not 6 for instance?

 ramoRJ96: anyone knows the problem about this code&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Is'nt that the exact same code than this morning&#160;?
 snoyes: what happens when you run it?
 ramoRJ96: BlaiseEbuth yeah it's the same but I don't yet solve the problem
 ramoRJ96: snoyes the 4th test failed 
 ShannonNorris97: Thanks for your help Jacek, I was totally misinterpreting the question and getting mixed up with the maximum aspect of it. I think I get it now
 BlaiseEbuth: I still think that eating the nuggets will be simpler...
 ShannonNorris97: Yeah that's true, maybe I should just do that instead...
 AntiSquid: are they MRM nuggets or fresh chicken breast nuggets?
 jacek: breast :yum:
 BlaiseEbuth: Perhaps it's precised in the puzzle constraints...
 ShannonNorris97: Sadly not, they let us down on this one
 BlaiseEbuth: I hate under-specified contributions...
 snoyes: ramoRJ96 The fourth test of what? Failed in what way? What was the input? What was expected?
 jacek: i think its chuck norris
 AntiSquid: bruce lee
 ramoRJ96: yeah it's Chuck Norris
 snoyes: ramoRJ96: and what does your code produce for that test?
 ramoRJ96: the expected result is different from the result found
 snoyes: I kind of assumed that.
 AntiSquid: and it gives an error, correct? ramoRJ96
 ramoRJ96: yeah but I don't know why&#160;?  
 AntiSquid: might be because the code is wrong ramoRJ96
 Mr.Pepper: is there something wrong with avatar :rolling_eyes:
 AntiSquid: that stickman has 2 necks
 Mr.Pepper: haha 
 Mr.Pepper: i meant  avatar of others are not showing
 jacek: huh
 Mr.Pepper: oh good now&#160;:)
 jacek: welp, my avatar is rotated a bit
 Mr.Pepper: :D
 ramoRJ96: yeah okey, It's possible I'm not really good with java
 AntiSquid: ramoRJ96 you could try D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/d_programming/index.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/d_programming/index.htm</a>
 jacek: you like the D dont you
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 give him what he thinks about
 Automaton2000: hi all, is there a way to find out
 jacek: AutomatonNN are you alright
 AntiSquid: someone banned it?
 AntiSquid: euler&#160;? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: bot lives matter
 jacek: btw. what up with wednesdays and frogs
 Mr.Pepper: wow what a relief after solving a puzzle
 jacek: space maze?
 Mr.Pepper: no , Scrabble :D
 Mr.Pepper: i tried space maze , have to do one day
 The_10x_Engineer: What problem can't be solved with something that Euler did :thinking:

 jacek: onitama
 AntiSquid: some vine thingy
 Marchete: I'm trying to implement jacekmax
 Marchete: "Final selection: select move according to formula: move's eval value + log(move's visits)"
 Marchete: "The final selection will mostly select move with highest visits, unless the eval score of less visited move is much higher."
 Marchete: The latter?
 jacek: hm?
 Marchete: your playground
 Marchete: has these 2 sentences
 jacek: the second sentence is just observation
 Marchete: and the first?
 Marchete: log(visits)?
 Marchete: what's that?
 jacek: each move has eval and visits, so the formula is eval + log(visits)
 jacek: move's visits
 Marchete: why log?
 Marchete: it comes from some theorem or smth?
 jacek: arse-pulled actually. in mcts you choose most visited move
 AntiSquid: tilt theorem
 jacek: in jacekmax, it will most of the time still mostly visited move
 Marchete: arse-pulled :D
 Marchete: ok then
 jacek: but if 2 moves have visit withing the same order of magnitude, then they are roughly equal and then eval of them is more important
 jacek: like 0.5 + log(20000) vs 0.6 + log(18000)
 Marchete: I just did the second part
 Marchete: first most visits
 AntiSquid: usually called magic number, not arse pulled 
 Marchete: except eval of another one was 1.05 the most visits
 jacek: also it was a quick &amp; dirty countermeasure against avoiding proven loss moves
 Marchete: but arse pulled can be ok too
 jacek: so i dont need to do ifs to exclude them
 Marchete: it's a good idea
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87846558-637e-4e05-8ba4-3fc2ee671e29">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87846558-637e-4e05-8ba4-3fc2ee671e29</a>
 jacek: +3 so to avoid any NaNs and infs
 Marchete: I'll ask you later about how to train that thing
 Marchete: I'm not very fond of NN's
 AntiSquid: why Marchete&#160;? it's like brutaltester with extra steps
 AntiSquid: NNs i mean
 jacek: the other way to see this final selection is too see as using lower confidence
 jacek: 1 move eval 0.4 and 10000 visits, 2 move eval 0.7 and 500 visits
 jacek: i would choose deeper search over shallow even if the latter shows good eval so far
 Marchete: it's note clear to me what to export
 Marchete: or what to train
 Marchete: value I imagine
 Marchete: but I'm not still there
 jacek: have you seen my tic tac toe n-tuples? it trains on all possible positions and their true values -1, 0, +1
 AntiSquid: it's fine tuning some weights, the weights you export ax + bx2 + cx3 + ... all x
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: if you use chat.pastebin.com
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple">https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple</a>

 Marchete: hard to search on spdn
 Marchete: also chat.pastebin isn't stored

 BlaiseEbuth: Jacek you're heeling to starboard...
 Marchete: my NN are more "Tensorflowish"  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a>
 Marchete: but I just did basic stuff
 Marchete: like MNIST examples and things like that
 Marchete: I need to replicate your tictactoe to see if it fits my code
 Marchete: to reuse it in jacekmax
 AntiSquid: tensorflow-ish = do it the normal way and import a model instead of writing from scratch&#160;?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: and creating a NN model like in TF
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka/blob/main/Mokka/Test_MNIST.cpp#L33-L42">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka/blob/main/Mokka/Test_MNIST.cpp#L33-L42</a>
 Marchete: that's similar to "real" ML frameworks
 Marchete: also AVX2 because why not
 jacek: well this tic-tac-toe example is nothing more than perceptron
 Marchete: but I'm dumb enough
 Marchete: I don't have the knowledge to easily know how to train bots
 Marchete: I mean you export N self plays
 Marchete: best vs candidate
 jacek: i see every evals as some kind of NN. chess material is just perceptron - a sum of chess piece values
 Marchete: but what "export"?
 jacek: N self plays? you mean positions?
 Marchete: I imagine you did N self games, with O moves each one
 Marchete: no?
 jacek: you mean tic tac toe?
 Marchete: I mean oware for example
 Marchete: I imagine jacekmax did N depth moves per turn, and pick a best move
 Marchete: but then, what?
 Marchete: move + eval?
 Marchete: move + win/loss?
 Marchete: no idea
 jacek: i train values only. so after like 1000 games you have 50000 (or more or less) positions. each position has label - the value of search tree
 Marchete: as you see I'm pretty dumb
 Marchete: that's like really basic NN
 jacek: position - eval
 jacek: when proven win = 1 and loss = -1
 AntiSquid: if you didn't get it, then you're overthinking it (the weights i mean) like anyone else overthinks lots of stuff
 jacek: (thats is if output of NN is tanh)
 BlaiseEbuth: :persevere:
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth rotate jacek to the left.</b></p><p><img src="/a/61829028497145" /> jacek: constipations?
 Marchete: position is the gamestate or a single move?
 jacek: gamestate
 Marchete: so tanh to limit to -1 +1
 jacek: also, if not mentioned, values are always  from perspective of 1st player
 jacek: 2nd player would just take the negative from nn prediction
 Marchete: gamestate + eval (or win/loss)
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: BlaiseEbuth why rotate?
 AntiSquid: blaise, that's his true face
 BlaiseEbuth: You're askew...&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: face angle i mean
 jacek: lol, i googled askew
 jacek: also, this is my subtle brain trolling. brain doesnt like subtle changes. at first i mirrored the face but no one noticed. so i had to take more extreme measures
 BlaiseEbuth: I noticed the mirroring...
 BlaiseEbuth: But was not disturbing
 jacek:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: use pink and yellow as colors
 AntiSquid: or purple and yellow&#160;? 
 Marchete: why would you like to disturb people?
 Marchete: that's disturbing
 Illedan: What are you trying to NN Marchete?
 Marchete: jacekmax
 Marchete: oware
 Marchete: I tried connect 4 with terrible results
 jacek: i wonder what you put as input for oware
 Marchete: hmm
 AntiSquid: what did you use for connect 4&#160;?
 Marchete: inputs?
 Marchete: 6+6+2scores
 AntiSquid: how many nodes per layer @_@
 Marchete: each one for 0.04
 Marchete: dunno!
 Illedan: Why scores?
 Marchete: why not?
 BlaiseEbuth: why why&#160;?
 AntiSquid: what is 6 in connect4&#160;?
 Marchete: not not?
 Marchete: not, that's in oware
 Illedan: Just more data to train when you really just want to maximize your current position
 jacek: fair enough
 Marchete: I'm a guetto NNer, mmkay?
 jacek: guetto?
 Marchete: stop questioning my networks
 Marchete: undocumented/rogue/fake
 Marchete: ghetto
 jacek: oh
 Illedan: Do you use TF?
 Marchete: yes, I use TF
 BlaiseEbuth: Who is he, what are his networks&#160;?
 Marchete: I mean, I can train with TF but I have no damn idea about how to do it properly
 AntiSquid: just do it, don't let your dreams be dreams

 Loth_Cat: I don't have discord so, what's happening
 AntiSquid: wasn't talking to you
 Loth_Cat: oh, sorry

 AntiSquid: the chat critter
 Loth_Cat: again,  sorry AntiSquid if I annoyed you, I'm a curios person by nature
 AntiSquid: not really, you would have to drop a long hellooooooooooooooo when nobody answered the second one
 AntiSquid: so no worries
 Loth_Cat: so, AntiSquid, how are you today?
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 AntiSquid: that doesn't concern you
 Loth_Cat: ok :grinning:
 jacek: oh my
 Westicles: Is this that FBI dude again?
 Loth_Cat: is everything alright?
 Loth_Cat: (you don't need to say, I'm just curios)
 AntiSquid: no, we are about to go protest election results at the capitol
 AntiSquid: peacefully
 AntiSquid: mostly
 BlaiseEbuth: The London capitol
 BlaiseEbuth: For the UK elections
 AntiSquid: no, nobody cares about that one
 AntiSquid: murica is where it's at
 Westicles: Oh, did the extremely far left party win over the extremely extremely far left party?
 BlaiseEbuth: the extremely extremely far left party is a right party cause you've just done a circle right
 AntiSquid: Joe Message isn't far left

 Westicles: Why do the feds always pretend to be cats?  First kitkat now this guy

 Westicles: This has been debated at length. They took out the christ but left in the cross, so it is ok
 jacek: do flintstones celebrate christmas
 Loth_Cat: idk
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: No. They are stones.
 therealbeef: flintstones is so heretic. everyone knows the earth is only 6000 years old
 AntiSquid: check the flintstones / jestsons conspiracy theories, proves they have christmas
 AntiSquid: because they are both set in the future
 therealbeef: ah flintstones is post-apocalypse?
 AntiSquid: one of the theories yes
 therealbeef: make sense
 AntiSquid: the other is that jetsons are the rich people living above ground away from lowly flintstone peasants
 Westicles: That explains all that Great Gazoo buisness
 AntiSquid: why? gazoo is an alien
 Astrobytes: When actually they were just American cartoons based on idealistic American lives?

 Loth_Cat: anyone herd of little nightmares 2?
 Westicles: More of a Doki Doki crowd here I think
 AntiSquid: i didn't like the first one and it clearly finished the story, what would the sequel even be about&#160;?
 AntiSquid: also heard, not herd
 Loth_Cat: you didn't like little nightmares?
 AntiSquid: chat critter herd :thinking:
 Loth_Cat: uh well, little nightmares 2 is apparently a prequel and provides a lot more story for Sixalso, if you don't mind me asking, what didn't you like about the first game?
 AntiSquid: everything or almost everything
 Loth_Cat: I see
 AntiSquid: the only reason i looked into it is because it was weird
 Astrobytes: Never even heard of it
 Loth_Cat: the world of little nightmares is very weird
 AntiSquid: and wow, now the story progresses backward? she's off the island, should go build her Tropico6 resort or something

 leojean890: Astrobytes I have just seen that you approved "ice and fire"&#160;:)
 Loth_Cat: I'm pretty sure that if LN2 is a prequel, then Six wouldn't have been to the maw before this game started
 Astrobytes: leojean890: Yes, it was after the SDK thing and had already been tested, it just needed approvals as the system had changed a little wrt community-made stuff
 AntiSquid: that's the only community approved CG contest :D
 leojean890: I've asked Blaise in the same time in #FR ^^ so I thought that you 3 validated the contest, but it's approval for the realease of a multi after the contest
 AntiSquid: community approved community contest&#160;?
 Loth_Cat: imma get off now, bye
 BlaiseEbuth: Violence is not an answer.
 BlaiseEbuth: It's THE answer.
 AntiSquid: too many deja-vu vibes from that chat critter
 AntiSquid: as if i knew the critter from one of its past lives
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmmm...
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: good luck with the letting agency/landlord thing. Not been on much today as I feel like shit, some cold or something
 Westicles: Are colds still a thing?
 Astrobytes: They never went away
 AntiSquid: it snowed in oxford yesterday Westicles :D
 therealbeef: icelandic ash
 AntiSquid: no, it's just damn cold here
 therealbeef: true, it being brittain
 AntiSquid: and scots have it worse i am sure
 BlaiseEbuth: With the kilt...
 Westicles: Wait, can you get a cold without catching it from another person?
 Astrobytes: ...
 AntiSquid: only if you don't wear a mask when you're alone in your car Westicles
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 Westicles: heh heh
 AntiSquid: on a serious note though, YES
 Astrobytes: yes what?
 BlaiseEbuth: Just yes.
 Astrobytes: IndyRef2?
 AntiSquid: yes germs
 therealbeef: germans?
 BlaiseEbuth: Be like squid, say yes to the germs.
 Westicles: Like if you are the last man alive but you walk around with wet hair
 Astrobytes: Germs, the evil parts of seeds
 therealbeef: being sexy for no use?
 Astrobytes: Nah all that's bollocks Westicles
 BlaiseEbuth: Last man will mostly walk around naked
 therealbeef: truth
 BlaiseEbuth: And so probably get a cold anyway
 Astrobytes: You can affect your immune system through exposure [to the elements] but unless you've already contracted said virus this will not cause a cold.
 AntiSquid: will get abducted by aliens, have a wife forged from his genes and restart civilization, they can't afford to end the galactic TV show BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably...
 therealbeef: that reminds me, only 2 months until 5th season of Rick and Morty
 AntiSquid:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: been waiting so long
 Astrobytes: therealbeef coming with the real beef
 therealbeef: got triggered by mention of galatic tv show :0

 Wontonimo: anyone else having issues with search race?  Is it just me or are the validation case kinda tricky?
 Wontonimo: normally I don't have issue with validation tests, like super rare
 Wontonimo: i get it, they are validation, but man I'm getting stuck
 Wontonimo: "Contrary to CSB, the positions are truncated and not rounded to the nearest integer even if the statement says so."
 Wontonimo: man, why do i put off RTFM 
 struct: Did you fix it Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: Really?  I have that same bug
 struct: whats your eval function?
 Wontonimo: it does this little dance trying grind it's butt up against the checkpoint or something
 struct: Try doing depth search 1 to see if you still have that bug
 Wontonimo: eval is total distance covered
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: no, it's good
 struct: Also if you eval every depth it should fix it
 struct: I also had that bug on slcc
 struct: But i have number of passed checkpoints - distance to next on eval
 struct: I just increase the value of number of passed checkpoints
 struct: So it values it more
 struct: After that I could just eval at end
 Wontonimo: i think i want to rewrite it.  it is different enough from CSB or SLCC because there are zero opponents or obsticals
 Wontonimo: i'm currently at 96th, but it was a fluke after many submits.  (hangs head in shame).  I think calculating the optimal path and using annealing could produce way better results
 Wontonimo: after i fix my math
 struct: The game is fun
 struct: Also public referee
 Wontonimo: oh right ... that's another thing i fail to check regularly
 Wontonimo: thanks struct, i think i'll give it another crack soon.  honestly I was just about to abandon it but you got me interested again
 struct: np
 struct: Also a small tip
 struct: Some people move the pod when they find a collision with checkpoint
 struct: you dont actually need to move it
 struct: Same for csb
 Wontonimo: what do you mean?
 struct: So on csb when  you collide with a pod
 struct: you move all the pods to the time of the collision
 struct: then apply the bounce
 struct: for the checkpoint you actually dont need to move the pods
 struct: you can just increase the nextcheckpoint
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b34a685b-96d0-4ded-9ec4-0acc181221e7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b34a685b-96d0-4ded-9ec4-0acc181221e7</a>
 struct: That code was from slcc
 Wontonimo: thanks
 struct: When bot completed all checkpoints
 struct: I taked into account the time of collision with last checkpoint on eval
 struct: I also took into account the turn
 struct: Just so pod rushes the checkpoint if its the last
 Wontonimo: nice, i like that last checkpoint logic!
 Drew99Kt: you think doing these coding test make you better programmer?? i feel like a lot of this will never be used
 struct: it improves your logic
 struct: imo
 Wontonimo: well practice will never make you better.  you are either born with skill or you are not.

 HellSys: hellop
 Wontonimo: Drew99Kt i'm just messin with ya.  yeah, i think for sure it stretches your abilities especially if you choose different langs and get out of your comfort zone
 Drew99Kt: yeah i know. just idk did good in all my classes but still struggling doing these coding test
 Wontonimo: which ones?
 struct: Sometimes it takes a little of time to click
 struct: People can struggle a lot at the beginning 
 Drew99Kt: i can code like 10 different programs using multiple tools and lanuages but these coding test making me feel dumb
 Wontonimo: which one are you working on?
 Wontonimo: setting reasonable expectations is super important.  it isn't clash of code.  some of them take me days
 Drew99Kt: i dont know how to share it

 Wontonimo: hey Drew99Kt, CoC makes me feel stupid quite often also.  Most people who have been on here a while dont do CoC
 Smelty: xD same

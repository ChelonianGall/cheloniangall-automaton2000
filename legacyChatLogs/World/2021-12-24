 anonymous2495: cant
 anonymous2495: understand manhattan street challenge
 Mcbuzz: hi all&#160;:)
 Mcbuzz: here to want to improve my coding logic
 nets-kd: you are welcome~
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: these uk guys never make any sense.  these are the same guys who always die in the colonial histories when they forget to wear hats out in the sun
 Wontonimo: :wave: Mcbuzz Welcome&#160;!
 AlkhilJohn.: wontomino do u like me
 Flaise: Hey guys
 Flaise: Anyone know if there are performance characteristics that are expected of a community contest? I.e. the server has to finish a timestep in 50ms or so?
 Wontonimo: in the games that arre already published it is in their description.  usually 100ms.
 Flaise: Not the client AIs, I mean the server itself.
 Wontonimo: if you are making one, you can set it to be lower i believe
 Wontonimo: oh, the server should respond almost immediately
 Wontonimo: is my understanding
 Flaise: hmm..
 Wontonimo: the referee really should only be checking if moves are valid and if the game is over / scoring.
 Wontonimo: what are you thinking Flaise&#160;?
 Flaise: And physics. The physics I'm considering is pretty resource-light as physics go; I expect it to run in less than 10ms on a weak computer. I.e. it's game-capable.
 Wontonimo: tell me more&#160;!
 Flaise: Mind you, it's just an idea. I'm going to toy with a bunch of ideas before I actually make something. But what I'm thinking is a multiagent simulation with a bunch of round objects. The round agents can overlap and will exert spring-like pressure to slide off of each other.
 Flaise: Thus, when they're in small numbers, they'll mostly take up the same amount of space. But when they pile into a choke point to go after an objective of some sort, they'll tend to compress.
 Wontonimo: like a race around a track with chokepoints?
 Flaise: So AI strategies could involve picking a "pointman" to pile _behind_ in order to squish the pointman through another group that's trying to keep your units out.
 Wontonimo: have one team have to go clockwise and the other counter clockwise haha
 Flaise: Eh, I mean, that's not a bad idea
 Flaise: Aesthetically, I prefer quasi-military stuff but counter-rotating racing is pretty simple and could make interesting dynamics
 Flaise: For example, you don't win if you don't get all your bots all the way through, so maybe pick off one straggler and try to drag him along with you as you get all your bots to the other side.
 Wontonimo: if it is a figure 8, or other self-intersecting pattern, then there is lots of opportunity for blockers to rush back and try to block again
 Flaise: Are there any AI ladder contests where the teams are asymmetrical or is an unwritten assumption that each match individually is balanced?
 Flaise: I mean, I guess the best way to have asymmetrical confrontation is to have different types of units available to the players, as in the Mean Max competition.
 Wontonimo: there are plenty of examples of asymmetrical games and how they compensate for it.  One common 
 Wontonimo: ways is for each "game" to include 2 rounds, where in the second round the players swap positions.
 Wontonimo: and the winner is the one with the highest total score of both rounds
 Wontonimo: another variant is that the first player makes their first move and the second player can either make their first move or decide to switch sides.  from there it proceeds as normal.
 Flaise: Huh. I've never heard of that one.
 Wontonimo: look at connect 4
 Flaise: In Arimaa, the first player to move is the first to set up so the player who moves second is counterpicking the strategy of the first to move.
 Wontonimo: it's a classic cake cutting fairness.  
 Wontonimo: i haven't made a multi
 Flaise: I've been wanting to make one but I've been also feeling quite worn out.
 Flaise: I remember back when I'd have an idea and just get started as soon as I didn't have anything scheduled.
 Flaise: Did I have more energy back then or did I consume less energy because I didn't know as much about coding?
 Wontonimo: i was very interested in making multis once i discovered them.  i had tons of ideas.  still do.
 Flaise: Come to think of it, I also had way more unfinished products.
 Wontonimo: :D
 Flaise: I'm more reticent to start something I'm not sure I'll finish.
 Flaise: It's just less satisfying to make junk that doesn't do anything.
 Flaise: What kind of multiplayer bot contest ideas do you have?
 Wontonimo: right now i'm interested in constraint problems (like the wave function collapse contrib I made) and generative story telling through simulation
 Wontonimo: but neither of those would make good multiplayer bots
 Flaise: What do you mean generative storytelling?
 Wontonimo: simulating a virtual community, where each person has attributes, wants, desires, and agency.  Events of history unfold (and are recored) by simulating the individuals of a community
 Flaise: Hmm, that could be a pretty interesting simulation
 Wontonimo: yeah, i really don't know how to start.  still researching.  thinking of really abstracting it to have as little context as possible
 Flaise: I've had thoughts of making an adventure game like one of those game boy/SNES ones where you can have different outcomes by picking which quests to do for which characters in what order. Seems vaguely in the same vein as what you're talking about.
 Flaise: But like you I have little idea where to start.
 Flaise: One thing I have done is made a nonlinear interactive fiction prototype. I don't feel like I've made any amazing discoveries but it's something.
 Flaise: It doesn't have any of the underlying details you're talking about and all the speech has to be hard-coded.
 Wontonimo: did i share this with you&#160;?  a very small text adventure game i made to demo using data structures to drive logic in a game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR">https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR</a>
 Wontonimo: commands you can use are north, south , ... inventory
 Wontonimo: and if you see an object you can say the name of the object to take it
 Flaise: I haven't seen that yet
 Flaise: ...I broke it in two commands.
 Flaise: inventory, then describe
 Wontonimo: describe isn't a command 
 Wontonimo: just 1 word commands
 Wontonimo: anyway, the source code is all there
 Wontonimo: it's really easy to add new rooms and actions
 Wontonimo: see if you can get to the infinite grassy fields
 Flaise: I got to the flowers but then the process promptly died again
 Flaise: Describe is a command. Line 120.
 Wontonimo: yeah, you probably have to run it locally
 Wontonimo: wow, the time limit for getting kicked out has been greatly reduced&#160;:(
 Flaise: Huh, that's not a lot of source code for the path I took.
 Wontonimo: you can also use "n" for north, and so on
 Wontonimo: line 17 lists a whole bunch of mapped commands
 Wontonimo: lines 27 to 69 could be moved to a data file which defines the whole world
 Wontonimo: actually from 27 to 86
 Wontonimo: so, if the data is moved to a file, then the whole game is only 96 lines of code including lost of white space
 Flaise: Neat
 Flaise: Trying to think how this could be a CG competition. ....Mmmnope, I think dialog is just a writer-to-player thing. :P
 Wontonimo: yes, indeed.
 Flaise: Although the underlying attributes and values and stuff would be an interesting, if difficult coding task.
 Flaise: I guess where my mind was going with the simulation that I made was there could be triggers that would make chains of events start in parallel to the player's activity.
 Flaise: So if you're in the right place at the right time, you can see something happen and intervene. If not, you hear news about it later.
 Flaise: And by paying careful attention to the news, you can direct events in your favor.
 Flaise: But I don't have any of that yet. It's very static and incomplete. Would you like to see what I made so far?
 Wontonimo: yeah, send me a DM or paste a link here
 Flaise: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://flaise.itch.io/ivory-tower">https://flaise.itch.io/ivory-tower</a>
 Wontonimo: I like it!
 Wontonimo: I like the "paper" feel to the board
 Flaise: What do you think of the dialog?
 Wontonimo: a little lengthy.  honestly, i skimmed it when it was more than 2 sentences
 Wontonimo: i like the mechanic of the conversation
 Flaise: Ah, ok. Different games for different folks. The purpose of the prototype was to focus on dialog.
 Wontonimo: but here i am showing you a TEXT ONLY game and complaining about yours having too much text lol.  It's fine man
 Flaise: xD
 Flaise: It's like the visuals detract from the text.
 Flaise: I once had someone who doesn't play games but loves Chess - I showed him a board game I made on my computer, he said he couldn't focus on the game because he was so enthralled by the animations.
 Flaise: In my head I was like "but it's just regular sinusoidal tweening"
 Flaise: ...What is wrong with me that I could even say that. This is exactly the kind of thing that shows up in shows like Big Bang Theory.
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: its late for me.  gn
 Wontonimo: see ya laterr Flaise
 Flaise: Yeah late for me too. Catch ya later

 Schwase: im thinking of making a rush hour puzzle contribution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)</a>
 Schwase: i might make a normal classic puzzle for practice first and then i think i'd like to try making it a solo game
 Schwase: which would then lead into an optimization puzzle
 Schwase: i'm worried however that there would be no way to prevent hardcoding of solutions
 Schwase: which would make it not work as an optim puzzle
 Schwase: i don't think that as a classic puzzle it would be very interesting because the solution would have to be just to print the minimum number of moves needed to solve the puzzle
 Schwase: but it could work for solo with a move limit
 BlaiseEbuth: There's certainly a way to generate new tests, so you can add a random one.
 Schwase: god its been so long since i've written in java
 Schwase: thats a good idea though. I think I could make the solo game with defined validators and that would be a good way to get myself into writing the solo game and from there writing code to generate random validators would be a sequential undertaking
 Schwase: /message
 itsmegreg: Found: NothingExpected: 0
 itsmegreg: How do you make this go away, I'm returning "0"
 itsmegreg: console.log(inputs == null&#160;? "0"&#160;: ans)
 5DN1L: Does that help you? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-check-for-null-in-javascript-dffab64d8ed5">https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-check-for-null-in-javascript-dffab64d8ed5</a>
 itsmegreg: Not really.
 Schwase: i think that article is behind a pay wall
 itsmegreg: It's the test not acknowledging that I'm returning a "0" or 0
 5DN1L: pay wall?
 Schwase: subscription require
 Schwase: *d
 Schwase: You’ve read all your free member-only stories, become a member to get unlimited access. Your membership fee supports the voices you want to hear more from.
 Schwase: lol well im not trying to solve a problem so im not even sure why i clicked on it haha
 5DN1L: itsmegreg You'll have to revise your code.  What's the puzzle you're trying to solve?
 itsmegreg: Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 5DN1L: I've guessed right :D
 itsmegreg: how do you make the input null lol
 5DN1L: I didn't check for null. I just relied on the value of n
 5DN1L: the number of temperatures
 5DN1L: not sure if you can just change ==  to === to make your code work though. I'm not expert in javascript
 itsmegreg: console.log(inputs===null&#160;? 0&#160;: ans)
 itsmegreg: still doesn't work
 itsmegreg: man I went through all that just to get stuck on this last test
 5DN1L: better just check if n == 0 or wait for somebody who knows javascript to help you :P
 itsmegreg: feelsbad
 5DN1L: if n == 0, print 0, then you don't have to check for null. but of course that is just escaping from the chance to learn how to check for null
 5DN1L: still another way it may work is to check the length/size of the split list/array
 itsmegreg: yep
 5DN1L: but checking n itself is the easiest
 itsmegreg: tried length, null undefined
 itsmegreg: oh wait it worked now
 itsmegreg: inputs == 0&#160;? console.log(0)&#160;: console.log(ans)
 itsmegreg: had to be like this
 5DN1L: wow, ok :D
 itsmegreg: what language do you code?
 5DN1L: python mostly
 5DN1L: although I did solve the puzzle in javascript :P
 5DN1L: well, in all languages offered here actually
 itsmegreg: I see, I don't have much use for it atm, but I'm very close to learning it just to have an easier time with problem solving
 5DN1L: Good, keep learning&#160;:)

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Do you think making a puzzle where you have to go off and google some complicated algorithm and figure out how to implement it is a good idea?
 Jay10890: anyone got the solution to ascii art 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: As opposed to implementing BFS or MCTS for the 50th time
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I'm torn since I always hated the horn sat one
 Schwase: i like unique puzzles like that
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Yeah, I think more would be good
 Wontonimo: if you want a complicated puzzle that you need to go research stuff, check out my wave function collapse puzzle that is pending Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker Westicles
 Flaise: Hey guys
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: well, that's the problem, it isn't getting approved.  when I did the one where you have to implement the Chudnovsky algorithm everyone rejected saying this is a programming site not algorithm research
 Flaise: Huh? Then how do they explain the cryptography puzzles already approved and the quest map section literally called "Algorithms"?
 Flaise: That's like saying "I want to learn to speak English. But no, I don't want to learn to get across complex points."
 Flaise: "No philosophy or history or literature in English class." &lt;- Then what content do you put in your sentences?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I think part of the turmoil is I didn't name the algorithm, but left them to find it themselves
 Schwase: i think that if the contribution is from someone im not familiar with im less likely to spend time looking into approving it
 Flaise: If I ever rank high enough to approve contributions, I'd consider approving puzzles like those.
 Schwase: i agree with that mentality but you still need to do the puzzle
 Schwase: and some of the hardest puzzles have only a handful of site members who have completed it, and a contribution requires 3 to be approved
 Schwase: its definitely a sub-community on the site
 Flaise: Just you wait. I'll get my level 20 or whatever the prerequisite is...
 5DN1L: yup, it's level 20
 Astrobytes: and definitely never approve anything without solving it (and not using the creators solution)
 Flaise: Which, in a way ironically, means I won't be focusing on those puzzles cuz they won't give me any XP just yet.
 Wontonimo: you do get xp as an approver (I think)
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 Schwase: Astrobytes was that sarcasm?
 Schwase: (genuinely unsure)
 Astrobytes: Schwase: No no, real comment. Though I trust Flaise not to do such things
 Flaise: Of course I wouldn't do that; it's silly.
 Flaise: The reason I wouldn't focus on those puzzles now is because it takes work to make sure they're good puzzles and I don't have the XP to approve them yet anyway.
 Schwase: right. was pretty sure you weren't being sarcastic. It's definitely important
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Pah.  There is one approved puzzle where even the author doesn't have a solution
 Flaise: I'm actually genuinely curious about the wave function collapse thing. I've never had an opportunity to get beyond Newtonian physics so seeing what the quantum world would be like after spending a lot of time watching explanatory Youtube videos would be neat.
 Astrobytes: Flaise: concentrate on having fun first before you get too serious&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: wave function collapse? Who made that?
 Astrobytes: Oh wait, Wontonimo
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Flaise, you gonna be disappointed. I was expecting something similar
 Wontonimo: hey
 Flaise: Astrobytes: I'm talking about Domino's puzzle. Er, I mean, Geronimo's puzzler. Er, no, sorry, Wontonimo's puzzle.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: don't get your hopes up about quantum Flaise ... it isn't constraint collapse (not quantum collapse)
 Flaise: Well.... Will I learn something at least?
 Wontonimo: i did writing it!
 Flaise: That's nice then
 Astrobytes: sounds decent, will have to check it out
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: (psst Astro... ascii art...)
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Wontonimo: what i love about the wave function collapse is that it a general content generation tool, can be used for images, text, music, mazes, dungeons, etc
 Wontonimo: it is good at repeating small patterns in the aesthetic of the original 
 Flaise: Now as much as I like the idea of "just having fun", I'm trying to build relevant skills, or at least shit to put on my profile, for getting a job. Really need a job.
 Flaise: Wontonimo: Mmk, then, that explanation is.... nothing like what I may have expected from something called "wave function collapse".
 Astrobytes: it's a nice companion to wave propagation for pathfinding, potential fields etc
 Flaise: Wait, seriously, you can use it for pathfinding?
 Flaise: Now this is interesting stuff that could go in the explanation/intro section on the puzzle's page, if it's not there already.
 Astrobytes: propagation not collapse
 Flaise: Oh ok. What's wave propagation?
 Astrobytes: essentially a Dijkstra variant

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: One of the french said having ascii art on the output is bad enough, but on the input as well is a crime against humanity (or words to that effect)
 Astrobytes: Yes I got the reference&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: it's not an ascii art puzzle
 Wontonimo: sigh
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: It looks good! If you wanna avoid that ASCII art label you could make it SDK-based (solo game)
 Flaise: Astrobytes: There's a Wikipedia article, which sure has an interesting animation on it.
 Flaise: Maybe I'll look more deeply into it later cuz I will need to code more pathfinding in the future.

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh, that's even better.  the beat you in 4s bots swarm on all these poor guys?
 Astrobytes: no not auto-submit bots
 Astrobytes: they don't need to worry about invites as such, they auto-join anything
 Wontonimo: hmm ... Astrobytes, that link you shared is more "flood fill" not wave function collapse.  I don't know why the TYer calls it WFC
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ihciMKlcP8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ihciMKlcP8</a>
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'm only half way through but what he is talking about is floodfill.  Really different
 Flaise: Wave propagation, not collapse
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: thaks
 Wontonimo: if you are trying to get to level 20 fast Flaise, then really focus on the puzzles that award high points.  Not all puzzles do.  Most community ones are at the bottom of the list.
 5DN1L: Yeah, those puzzles associated with achievements
 Wontonimo: Another way to mine levels is to make a really good community contribution and keep it in WIP <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507070b7925f661e2d2835c14f950b9d157e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507070b7925f661e2d2835c14f950b9d157e</a> --&gt; 421 upvotes and 10 points per upvote
 Flaise: lol...
 Flaise: Well I am reading the API docs now
 Wontonimo: it can even be a classic in/out
 Flaise: There's a browser based game where you build bots and outfit them with AIs (provided by the developer) and you have to put them in the playing arena repeatedly for months on end to grow them stronger. Wouldn't it be funny to rip off those game mechanics on CG so people can build their own AIs as fast as they want?
 Wontonimo: that would be fun
 Flaise: After all, you can't copyright ideas. :P
 Wontonimo: apple and amazon would like that to be false
 Wontonimo: microsoft even tried to copyright binary
 Wontonimo: I sent you a DM  Flaise
 Flaise: Apple and Amazon and Google and Oracle and Microsoft can go cry in a corner and count their money until they feel better.
 Flaise: No copyrighting ideas. Yeesh.
 Flaise: Also there's a space combat themed game I made for the Global Game Jam a few years ago. Would make a fun multiagent puzzle.
 JoeFather: yo anyone want to join my clash of code i just want to do some reverse only
 JoeFather:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: post clash request to #clash
 zakacat: Could be
 Wontonimo: what?  Another Canuk?  Hey zakacat!  
 zakacat: Howdy, I am not sure how to whisper. How are you Wontonimo. Are you a mod?
 <b>**Wontonimo if you type /me zakacat then it is kinda like a wisper</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: yes, i is mod
 Wontonimo: just recently though
 Wontonimo: you can also DM someone by typing /msg Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker 
 Wontonimo: or another name
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: Flaise: Feel free to bring any ideas / existing games you have to the multi section, we need some freshness in here
 Wontonimo: i've been sitting on the following for a while&#160;: take an existing game and turn it into NN only.  on turn 1 the bots submit their NN (architecture and all) and on consecutive turns they are allowed 1 resubmit of their bot.  Otherwise their bot follows their NNs decisions only.  Alternatively, allow feeding up to N parameters (1 to 4, not too many) to the bots inputs in addition to the game input
 Wontonimo: I don't think i'll ever get around to coding it.
 Wontonimo: it would really be an eye opener for people wanting to get into NN
 zakacat: What is the max value that I can have in the first spot of an ip address? 256 or something?
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: I've had a couple of beers now admittedly but I'm unsure as to how this would work on CG in practice
 Astrobytes: specifically: "and on consecutive turns they are allowed 1 resubmit of their bot.  "
 Wontonimo: i too have had several beers
 Wontonimo: perhaps today is not the right day for such an exchange of ides 
 <b>**zakacat Wontonimo Thanks, I appreciate the info! Yes, Christmas Eve and programming and writing rudimentary math problems, haha</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: so Astrobytes, on frame 1 your bot submits an NN, then it has nothing to do for the rest of the game.  What if at some later point in the game your bot realizes that a different version would be much better in this situation, then it could instead of saying "PASS" that frame it would send the new NN.
 Wontonimo: to prevent people from circumventing the who purpose of having their NN mostly control their Bot, you wouldn' t want someone to send a new NN every round and have the NN just hard code the result of a MCTS or other optimization 
 Wontonimo: there is lots you can do with NN only multis, like supporting evolution or search out-of-the-box
 Lachrymosa: I still have a hard time conceptualizing how to write the evaluations of a MM, NN blows my mind :V
 Wontonimo: gotta go.  Good night everyone.  Happy holidays and happy new year&#160;!  See ya Astrobytes Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker zakacat Flaise 5DN1L jacek
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 zakacat: Merry Christmas
 zakacat: Clash makes me anxious&gt;
 zakacat:&#160;?
 zakacat: lol
 Lachrymosa: zakacat don't look at it like you're competing against others, instead think about it as competing against yourself. If you can solve problems at all, then faster, then cleaner. Use the shared code feature of others after to see how they did it and if you can improve. Thats all I really do with it
 44AA44: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 Dren: indeed
 DialFrost: morning guys
 DialFrost: first time its only me online in chat
 DialFrost: :P
 Im4Gn4ry: no
 TherealSpiny: no
 TherealSpiny: helooooo anyoneee
 maxymczech: hola
 TherealSpiny: yo yo how u been
 qwatry: Bro
 qwatry: Christmas!
 ChocoIndustrie: Merry Christmas!
 WhiskeyNCola: merry christmas
 Thorcode: Mery Christmas guys
 WhiskeyNCola: has anyone solved the lost astronaut problem?
 Thorcode: for some reason I find hackerank is harder than this site
 ASM_MOV_INT: one of the problems is to find an astronaut? cool
 nodnsoidnis9od: Hello people 
 nodnsoidnis9od: Something cool and clever
 SAJJADAMIRI: Does anyone know where to find the codes of these games, my university score depends on one of these games
 BlaiseEbuth: :zipper_mouth:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: these kids keep getting dumber
 BlaiseEbuth: Kids these days...

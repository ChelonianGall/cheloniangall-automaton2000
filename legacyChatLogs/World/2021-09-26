 ProCoder03: can we convert a base 12 number to base 10 in C#&#160;??
 ProCoder03: without manually doing it&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: no, only for a few bases like 2 and 16 it's possible with System.Convert
 eulerscheZahl: don't ask me why, would have been easy to support all bases up to 36 at least
 eulerscheZahl: python does that btw
 ProCoder03: I have to write my own converter then, okay Thanks eulerscheZahl
 raizbro: APA

 ProCoder03: can you please go to #spam for spamming 
 raizbro: ok that make me said
 raizbro: of kors
 eulerscheZahl: thanks ProCoder, I just tabbed away for a few minutes
 raizbro: ok
 raizbro: friend tell me the code
 jacek: you dont get electroshock everytime someone spams?
 gavi: @eulerscheZahl Hello! do you remember the fun TicketToRide puzzle?
 gavi: You solution was&#160;;-p  the fastest by a factor of 2x....now there is one slightly faster and that uses less memory....&#160;;-p
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: i assume that you are telling me you wrote a more efficient one? congratulations
 jacek: impossibru
 jacek: i dont see that puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i don't remember that puzzle in detail. solved it &gt; 2 years ago
 eulerscheZahl: looking at my code formatting I was still using MonoDevelop when I wrote it
 Stickmin: test
 jacek: :upside_down:
 el-musleh: what "CHARACTERS" in the result means? 
 NeevShah: hello
 jacek: characters are part of string :tada:

 darkhorse64: it depends on what you want to achieve: for writing a bot for a multiplayer, all the usual modules are available. For a precise list, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>. If you want to design a game, you must use CG SDK and Java or Kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: or Scala, Groovy, Clojure. But no one should use Clojure for the sanity of those trying to read the referee afterwards
 tbt485: How to start as a beginner
 tbt485: know nothing
 Daki404: hi
 cooboth: Hello
 evilDeimos:&#160;;)
 gavi: I did not mean to criticise. Your code is at least 2x faster than all other C#. And of course you are amazing, so high in the rankings it is super impressive. I am just starting here. And yes, you were on a different version of C#, which makes a lot of difference, and often times I have got the impression that you prefer elegant , short code with a cool strategy rather than maximizing speed. 
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't see it as criticism, no worries. just saying that i don't remember what I did there or what the puzzle was about
 gavi: OK, cool, I just want to say how impressive is what you do. I always go to see your solutions to learn something.
 eulerscheZahl: and it's totally possible that I called it a day when all testcases were green. sometimes i try to find a performant solution, sometimes not
 eulerscheZahl: glad to hear
 gavi: Yes, indeed. Also, you answered an incredible amount of puzzles. Of course, once you get the green light, you don't keep optimizing each one
 DimitrisLamprinos: Hey guys! Can I enable vim mode somehow?
 eulerscheZahl: there should be something in the IDE settings. not sure how well it works since CG switched from ACE to Monaco Editor
 Westicles: what does BA mean in french?
 eulerscheZahl: there are multiplayer games and optimization games for this purpose. I try to write more efficient code in those cases. Unfortunately you can't see them, as this would spoil the competition
 eulerscheZahl: BA? Bachelor degree?
 Scarfield: Baguette?
 BlaiseEbuth: In what contest&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: context?
 BlaiseEbuth: *context
 BlaiseEbuth:  ^^
 eulerscheZahl: the lack of contests hits us hard
 69razer69: 69 in shortest
 Westicles: Er, I was angry at the troll so J'ai fait une BA en fait :p
 eulerscheZahl: i even went to yare. now i feel this tension the whole day already. glad when it's finally over
 gavi: I am only a hobbyist...I learn to code for fun and as a hobby
 BlaiseEbuth: Bonne Action
 Scarfield: how did your match go yesterday euler?
 eulerscheZahl: that's how I (and probably most of us) started
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm getting paid for writing code
 gavi: that's why I was so surprised of how well that solution did in comparison with the others (time/memory)
 eulerscheZahl: there was no match tomorrow. finals in 1.5h
 Westicles: ah, thanks Blaise
 Scarfield: You got to the final then?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. someone even made a video summary<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VIE8k0F34&amp;ab_channel=Yare-io">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VIE8k0F34&amp;ab_channel=Yare-io</a>
 Scarfield: nice, grats!
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 Scarfield: will the final be streamed? think i saw mention that the semi finals were streamed
 eulerscheZahl: will be streamed, see video description of my link above
 Scarfield: sure&#160;:) good "luck"
 eulerscheZahl: i've been busy the last 2 days to prepare for this fight. we'll see if it's good enough
 eulerscheZahl: completely destroyed boom-bot. but thebitspud is another league
 gavi: cool video! Spoiler eulerscheZhal won!
 eulerscheZahl: but it was close
 eulerscheZahl: me made a few mistakes, he had the win already
 gavi: you are inspirational
 eulerscheZahl: *he madewell, I did too
 Scarfield: its weird to see a game that has a level of interactiveness, pretty cool idea
 struct: gl on the match euler
 Stickmin: any Asean here?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you
 eulerscheZahl: i can assure you that my bot is not as interactive as Aecert's
 eulerscheZahl: when he attacked my star from the side, i just couldn't counter it and place my units in between. because the code didn't cover it
 eulerscheZahl: i always move on a straight line
 eulerscheZahl: from by base to his
 eulerscheZahl: my*
 eulerscheZahl: other contest:
 eulerscheZahl: Submit your agent by 11.59PM UTC today (~12H from now) to qualify for the Round 1 Leaderboard.Submission instructions: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/docs/submission-instructions">https://www.gocoder.one/docs/submission-instructions</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't have a bot there
 struct: is that the same game?
 struct: from previous gocoder
 eulerscheZahl: oh wow, it's 3 vs 3 now<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland">https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i muted most of their discord so i missed out a lot
 struct: I always thought that 2vs2 bomberman would be better than 1vs1
 struct: maybe 3vs3 is good too
 struct: I was gonna port it to cg, some version of it
 eulerscheZahl: we have hypersonic already, i don't think we need it
 eulerscheZahl: and not all rules of their game convince me
 struct: i hate multiple players games
 eulerscheZahl: and possible copyright?
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium was fine because MIT. i have no idea about bomberland
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pommerman.com/">https://www.pommerman.com/</a>
 struct: no prizes this time?
 eulerscheZahl: at bomberland? i have no idea
 eulerscheZahl: "Join the leaderboard to win prizes, get featured on Twitch streams, and live your AlphaGo dreams."
 eulerscheZahl: and i thought CG certificates were exaggerated
 struct: ah
 struct: this is jsut to check the game
 struct: "We've just released an early access version of our first sandbox environment, Bomberland, and plan to launch our first competition in late 2021."
 struct: With the low amount of players that participated last time 
 struct: I might give this time a try
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes the player count and game design are related
 eulerscheZahl: but yare deserves more than 23 players IMO
 struct: very high prizepool for just 23 players
 eulerscheZahl: or very few players for that prizepool, as the prize was announced before the players joined
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair: you had to beat boom-bot to join the contest. that's like silver boss on CG i would say. so reaching gold
 eulerscheZahl: keeping the player count low is reasonable when you can't automate the matches because of human interaction
 eulerscheZahl: and i think i would have joined the contest for a much lower prizepool like the standard tshirt prize as well
 struct: yeah, people on cg dont join the contest for the prize
 eulerscheZahl: a small carrot hanging in front of me helps to get my attention and stand out from other games that I could play at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: but a tshirt is enough is the game design is solid
 eulerscheZahl: i decided against bomberland despite money prizes for top ranks. would have been pretty easy to get a few bucks at least
 wlesavo: euler finals will be on the same twich channel right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 wlesavo: gl
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: right now it has some weird advertising. not sure when the stream starts but should be soon
 wlesavo: yeah, thats why asked
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/baumannzone">https://www.twitch.tv/baumannzone</a>this one might stream it too, at least did so for the semifinal
 eulerscheZahl: yes, opened yare right now. but spanish
 eulerscheZahl: cat is here. why now&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: sleeping outside all day long
 eulerscheZahl: roxkstar is there too
 struct: I see
 struct: gl euler
 struct: the spanish streamer is watching your cg profile :p
 eulerscheZahl: i just closed him as i don't understand a word
 gavi: @eulerscheZhal  i see that you prefer C#. CG site is is my fav so far. Are there other interesting sites with a very updated version of C#&#160;?
 gavi: if it can be asked here
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: Hi everyone
 struct: gg euler
 Scarfield: gg
 wlesavo: gg
 Astrobytes: i'm late, did I miss it?
 wlesavo: yes
 Astrobytes: score?
 wlesavo: 3-1 fast games
 Scarfield: latestrobytes
 Astrobytes: yeah, sorry, youtube moderating, totally forgot about this
 eulerscheZahl: toad only won the first game with cheese. bitspud could counter
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to excuse yourself, you don't have to watch&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I was looking forward to it!
 eulerscheZahl: i mostly got my but kicked
 Astrobytes: Tough opponent that one
 Scarfield: nice prize though, had no idea about the ethereum prices
 Astrobytes: Well done regardless euler, you did well
 eulerscheZahl: i may have done some misjudgement about shape strength. or he's just the better coder of us
 eulerscheZahl: could quickly react to my cheese, i couldn't have done the same with my bot
 Scarfield: bool cheeseCounter = false/true
 Astrobytes: Your bot was a little rigid/inflexible in certain situations yeah
 Scarfield: maybe circles where just better than squares? there were triangles mentioned as well?
 eulerscheZahl: triangles were eliminated quickly. not sure if bad bots or bad shape
 eulerscheZahl: anyone experience with ETH? is there something to store your coins offline like Electrum for BTC?
 eulerscheZahl: i see lots of websites to store it for you but that's not what I want
 Scarfield: i think its called a wallet, no idea though, never got into bitcoin
 eulerscheZahl: i have BTC but now i need an ETH address
 eulerscheZahl: there is the official one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist">https://github.com/ethereum/mist</a>but archived
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i'll ask on the yare discord directly
 struct: I guess you could use a temporary one and then convert it into bitcoin and send it to the btc wallet
 eulerscheZahl: downloaded MyCrypto now, that's an offline wallet
 eulerscheZahl: asks you to re-enter your recovery key each time
 3r1c_02: You mean something like the CDC Defi Wallet or a Ledger Wallet? Are you looking for a spftware or a hardware wallet?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to buy extra hardware, i trust my OS
 eulerscheZahl: and a written recovery phrase as a backup
 3r1c_02: Do you also want to perform DeFi-Transactions with the wallet or do you want to use it only to store the value?
 eulerscheZahl: only as a storage. keep it there and maybe react to prize changes in a year or 2. but i've created my wallet now
 eulerscheZahl: and yare already sent the prize. really fast
 Astrobytes: That was indeed extremely fast!
 Scarfield: easy shipping
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank took 1 month to transfer $75 worth of BTC
 jacek: maybe they didnt pay for the fee
 eulerscheZahl: they even managed to ship the tshirt faster to my place than the money (i won both in the same contest)
 Astrobytes: lol, noobs
 eulerscheZahl: a tshirt from India. with a tracker showing different locations there for 2 weeks until it got international. faster than bits
 eulerscheZahl: and during that month BTC climbed, so i got less BTC out of it
 eulerscheZahl: still was around $900 at that time. so a huge win on the long run
 eulerscheZahl: winner got $2500 iirc. but not in BTC, so I actually won more
 Eden998: when creating a contribution, what is validator?
 eulerscheZahl: a testcase that's only executed on submit
 Eden998: so whats the difference between this and test?
 eulerscheZahl: testcase: visible in the IDEvalidator: to make sure that you don't hardcode vs the visible testcases
 Eden998: oh so I do something similar to the test but different situation?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. if the testcase asks you to primefactor a large number, make the validator another number in a similar range (a bit smaller maybe)
 eulerscheZahl: a validator should never be harder than a testcase so you don't get random timeouts on submit
 eulerscheZahl: and cover the same aspect of the problem
 eulerscheZahl: testcase: is a prime numbervalidator: should also be a prime
 jacek: not much love for counting tictactoe? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7262f1d66b7bd09545686dcbb89441db1161">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7262f1d66b7bd09545686dcbb89441db1161</a>

 Eden998: I see, thanks :D
 jacek: lets make it counting uttt
 jacek: woah teapot updated loa
 jacek: and increased to 150ms :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: how many turns?
 eulerscheZahl: 200?
 jacek: max 150
 eulerscheZahl: then he could go up to 200ms
 jacek: but sane games end around 40
 struct: limit should be like 100
 eulerscheZahl: and the insane ones?
 struct: I dont see any game with good bots lasting that long
 struct: a good bot vs a bad one will be under 20 turns
 jacek: their wives dont like it either
 struct: most long games happen due to move repetition
 Eden998: when entering a string to input in a test case, do I need to write it with quotation mark?
 struct: no
 struct: should negamax return the same number of iterations that minimax does?
 struct: Currently its a massive diference&#160;:/
 jacek: you mean alpha beta?
 Eden998: is there anyway to check my contribution before submitting?
 struct: yes jacek
 struct: negamax with ab
 jacek: dunno if the same. but at the very least the same order of magnitude
 jacek: Eden998 private contribution
 Eden998: kk thanks :D

 DimiMav: hello all! I am trying to play a challenge of tic tac toe in javascript and i get confused with that readline() is doing. Does someone have an idea?
 struct: reads the next line in input
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... This name isn't explicit at all...
 DimiMav: i dont get what it actually reads and how am i supposed to play this game
 Uljahn: isn't it more reasonable to start with something more simple and feasible
 DimiMav: i cant find many games that are more simple than this one
 struct: puzzles
 struct: work the same way
 DimiMav: others seem more complicated
 Uljahn: Power of Thor ep.1

 jacek: it has tutorial
 struct: :notebook::soccer:
 DimiMav: the descent i tried and it was ok
 DimiMav: I will try the other too
 Uljahn: also read the hints on the left
 DimiMav: it would have been a bit more helpful for these games to have some starting instructions on how the written code is being used 
 DimiMav: for someone to start the game
 struct: only coders strike back has that
 DimiMav: as whats makes it difficult for me is not how to play but how to translate the starting code to my benefit
 jacek: yeah, it teaches inputs and outputs

 DimiMav: thank you!
 struct: jacek how do you add randomness to negamax?
 Scarfield: The statements describe how the input is given, not all statements are as clear as others though. Are you sure you have read the statement fully, also error printing can be used both for debugging and checking the "format" of the input
 struct: do you just add randomness to the eval
 jacek: i use no randomness for negamax
 jacek: at most random few first moves
 struct: due to iterative deepening?
 jacek: yes
 struct: Ill add that next I guess
 struct: and then the TT
 struct: also will still need to figure how to hash
 jacek: just smoke it

 struct: temp.boards[0] &amp;= ~moves[i];temp.boards[1] ^= moves[i];
 struct: And took me so while to find
 struct: temp.boards[player] ^= moves[i];temp.boards[player ^ 1] &amp;= ~moves[i];
 struct: I needed to do this instead
 struct: I was forgetting to change player&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: ah, the hardcoded player number
 struct: I can get depth 5-6 now
 struct: instead of always 5 
 struct: due to the iterative deepening so I guess it was worth
 Wontonimo: that's pretty good depth
 struct: eval will be quite hard to do I think
 struct: Maybe when I sort moves I can go always depth 6
 Wontonimo: sorting moves vastly improves the pruning from alpha-beta, so even depth 7 is a possibility
 Wontonimo: using the previous best move to start with when deepening is a good start
 struct: I need to figure how to do that
 struct: currently I just increase depth and do the negamax again
 struct: while I have time
 Wontonimo: in UTTT, do you keep a pointer to the parent in your nodes?
 struct: no
 Wontonimo: right, of course not
 Wontonimo: you have a list

 Wontonimo: that you make
 Wontonimo: where i'm going with this is ...
 struct: ah
 struct: ok continue :p
 Wontonimo: what if you ALSO had a "best parent list" that you copied the current stack of parent node pointers over to when you find the next best move
 Wontonimo: no, wait ... that's silly.  it won't work
 struct: If I store all the moves that lead to taht it should right?
 struct: i could even do it before initializing negamax the 2nd time
 struct: just to get the alpha and beta
 Wontonimo: yes
 struct: seems like the easy way to do it
 struct: or I can just store the best state
 struct: which seems even simpler
 struct: ofc the list is more usefull if I want to do more stuff than just update the alpha and beta
 Wontonimo: are you doing this as a recursive function?
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: good luck.  i've not tried ordering minimax
 Wontonimo: gotta go
 Wontonimo: gn
 struct: gn

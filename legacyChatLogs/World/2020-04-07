 MadKnight: what's the problem thaibien&#160;?
 Riyuk: Hey
 Riyuk: @MadKnight you don't sleep :p
 MadKnight: i slept at daytime
 eulerscheZahl: he's like a dolphine: sleeping with half of his brain
 MadKnight: how's your submarine Riyuk&#160;?
 Riyuk: Still a lot of things to improve
 Riyuk: I need to fix some bugs on my moves in order to get to silver
 Riyuk: How's yours?
 Riyuk: You're more or less like him @eulerscheZahl :D
 eulerscheZahl: i just work up after an 8h sleep
 mark7: How to get to gold??:sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: rank above the silver boss
 Neon_Tuts: I not sleeped at
 eulerscheZahl: beat captain Haddok
 mark7: That knda hard
 Riyuk: You're more like a shark then
 Riyuk: PP oO
 Zandy156: Silver boss has a few weaknesses.
 Zandy156: I don't know about the other bots at that rank though.
 mark7: But only beating silver boss is not enough
 Zandy156: everyone who's in gold now seems quite strong.
 mark7: Right now I analyze every replay in which i lose and trying to improve
 thousandSun: so how exactly do i complete these challenges?
 thousandSun: im new here
 Neon_Tuts: Hello World

 Th1nhNg0: có  ai có gợi ý nào cho "ocean of code" không&#160;?
 Th1nhNg0: sorry wrong channel
 AntiSquid: ya nobody here speaks vietnamese
 Riyuk: You can have some suggestions/Ideas here as well @Th1nhNg0
 Cappefra: I'm kind of stuck on skynet 2
 Riyuk: That's a valid readon to start Ocean of code :p
 Cappefra: I'm already doing it :grinning:
 Cappefra: still bronze league but I hope I'm moving up
 Nerchio: how do I go about precise tracking like some people do even in bronze? It will probably take twice as many lines of code as I already have :D
 Cappefra: yeah that's one of the issues
 Nerchio: I feel like I am not advancing any further without adding tracking atm
 Cappefra: my code's decent on tracking but not great on movement and decision making
 Nerchio: I am only doing some tracking when I hit the enemy and i shoot randomly :P
 Cappefra: yeah tracking's important. Work on an external IDE if you're not already doing it
 Nerchio: how many lines of code you have in bronze? I know languages can differ a lot :p
 Cappefra: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec45c9fc-5ac8-4050-a506-5efdd6c18ffc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec45c9fc-5ac8-4050-a506-5efdd6c18ffc</a>
 Cappefra: wot
 Cappefra: anyways, around 1300
 Cappefra: with that style you see in the link's snippet
 Cappefra: a lot of it is architecture though. I feel like having lots of classes simplifies the algorithm a bunch, so tracking comes easier and all
 Nerchio: yea for sure I need to fix my mess before I continue making this more sophisticated
 Cappefra: It's my first contest so I underestimated the issues at first, I started coding imperatively until I got to position 800 or so, then I noticed it would become way too messy and I deleted everything and did it OOP
 Cappefra: it was worth it though cause I went from 1300 to 680 in one submit
 Nerchio: nice i do OOP and I am around 500 but it's a simple bot
 Nerchio: my next step will probably double it
 Nerchio: I am guessing people keep a list of moves by the enemy and recalculate each round until they find something?
 Cappefra: that sounds like a way to do it
 Riyuk: You need to track the enemy as much as possible and hit him only when you're more or less sure in order to get to silver
 Cappefra: but there's many things you can consider: moves, your hits and your misses, its hits and its misses, its surfaces...
 Nerchio: yea i know :S
 Nerchio: lots of stuff
 Nerchio: that's quite a challenge 
 Cappefra: yeah but if you study what happens to the map of possible position one can have after a particular move
 Cappefra: with a little bit of graph (grid) theory you can get pretty precise
 tobk: "If you fail to output a valid action, you will SURFACE in that turn." This should be reworded to "If you fail to provide a movement action (MOVE or SILENCE), ..."
 Uljahn: why
 tobk: (i.e. if you e.g. TORPEDO or just MSG, you will still surface if you have no way to go)
 tobk: at least so it seemed when I just tried
 tobk: also meaning you an not delay the SURFACE if you have just one health left...
 Uljahn: actions are not just moving and silence but all possible commands besides MSG
 Uljahn: "Each turn you must perform at least one action."
 tobk: hm, I just tried, but surfaced despite doing "torpedo ..." but without moving
 Riyuk: i.e you surface automatically if you don't move or silence&#160;?
 Uljahn: check the syntax
 Uljahn: i guess you have a bug
 tobk: Well, that's what happened when I just tried. Maybe someone else can confirm?
 Uljahn: show the replay
 tobk: don't have a replay ready right now, and takes a while to reproduce one
 Uljahn: your target was out of range
 tobk: weird, not it worked. could drop a mine without moving and did not surface.
 tobk: okay, forget about it...
 Lily123: hi,
 Lily123: how is it possible to see other's solution and compare it to your's?
 Uljahn: solve the puzzle then submit and get 100% correct
 Uljahn: then you'll be able to see the community solutions
 Uljahn: for that language you solved with
 KiwiTae: hows the contest going? :D Uljahn your on it?
 Nerchio: for enemy prediction do you guys use a queue for enemy moves and repeat it for every position on the map?
 Uljahn: hi Kiwo, im stuck in silver
 KiwiTae:  Uljahn im in Wood2 hehe
 KiwiTae: no time&#160;:(
 Quidome: @Nerchio, ik keep a trail for every possible starting position, throwing out the ones that are impossible
 Quidome: After a silence you can have multiple trails for a single starting position&#160;:(
 Nerchio: yea but at the start there is so many starting positions so you have like 150 trails? :P
 inoryy: maintaining possition masks is more efficient rather than queue
 Nerchio: I thought about that but feels like a queue gives you more precise information
 inoryy: the position distribution process is markov so you don't need to care about history except for when a mine is triggered and your mask is wrong
 codingWhale: When you remember where the enemy has been before, though, and are able to narrow it down enough, isn't that an advantage because you know where the enemy cannot go (because he's already visited some cells)? I feel like it'd help.
 Nerchio: I am thinking that way that's why I am leaning towards a queue. In my mind it's much simpler to implement
 Nerchio: This is my first competition so I am not sure if at any time you are close to reaching the response time limit?
 Ifthel: I'd store both. Keep a mask if you want to know their visited cells but otherwise rely on a mask
 Nerchio: I can imagine that for some maps and queue of 20 moves it can get quite long
 Ifthel: queue*
 inoryy: yes, maintaining a mask that you update on each step is helpful. a full history of actions in addition to that is also helpful. a full list of actions on its own, not so much.
 kovi: maintaning a mask is importatn in these days
 Riyuk: fore sure @kovi :p
 T-Rone: THE RIVER I  i don't understand
 T-Rone: help help me
 Quidome: What do you not understand?
 T-Rone: the queue
 Quidome: Still not sure whatr you ask
 Quidome: Do you understand the problem statement or need help with the solution?
 T-Rone: yes but i can't watch it
 Quidome: What do you mean by can't watch it
 T-Rone: the solution
 Quidome: You can only see the other solutions after you solved it yourself
 T-Rone: this  ,i know ,thank you  
 Quidome: You don't need a queue to solve it though
 yfprojects: have you seen the teaser for the spring challenge?
 Quidome: a simple while loop will do
 Quidome: nice teaser right&#160;!
 Quidome: Can't wait :D
 T-Rone: oh&#160;??  
 T-Rone: the loop must be required
 Quidome: while the 2 numbers are unqual calculate the new number for the smallest
 Quidome: when equal, you found it
 T-Rone: that is right:joy::smiley:
 yfprojects: where is dbdrs chatlog?
 T-Rone: i am going to have dinner ,bye bye ,thank you very much--

 Nerchio: I think my calculations got so heavy that it lags the browser :D
 wlesavo: nice sub chuck
 chucknorris: thx. yeah finally some real improvement
 chucknorris: but lets wait for pb4's submit, I have terrible winrate vs him usually  :p 
 pb4: don't worry about this one
 pb4: I'm trying to fix my abysmal surface code
 pb4: I basically self-kill myself a lot of the time by surfacing excessively
 chucknorris: yeah thats my main problem too atm... shoots the opponent and then surface without a silence. 
 pb4: not exactly mine
 pb4: see lots of space in front of me
 pb4: think that if I surface that's even more space
 pb4: --&gt; surface -_-
 chucknorris: yeah it's really hard to balance. if you reduce the space coeff than it will go into small cornes too shoot the enemy. and then you'll have to silence in few rounds :p 
 chucknorris: *surface

 pb4: I've disabled all torpedo code to debug
 pb4: and I got a win vs euler :D
 chucknorris: I'm thinking about feeding the features of the game to a mini eval NN. and have multiple versions of my bots running in a local trueskill system, and keep the parameters of the winner bot :p idk if it'd overfit against itself tho 
 dbdr: euler is abnormally low no?
 dbdr: maybe he has broken sth
 chucknorris: running games directly throught the api is considered as cheating&#160;?

 Liftyee: also im a noob so don't judge
 Nerchio: can I torpedo and silence&#160;?
 AntiSquid: Liftyee at least you didn't hit the single square lake :D
 AntiSquid: mine doesn't dodge small lakes either no worries Liftyee
 mark7: How do you store possible mines?  Do you avoid going there? 
 yfprojects: AntiSquid didnt you make a pacman multiplayer game?
 mark7: I am facing a weird bug.Lets say I triggered a mine, op shoot a torpedo in adjacent cell, so op health decreases by one, but my bot think op life decreased because of mine and My tracking system loses op. How to tackle it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446469009">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446469009</a> move 85. Number on left is opponent possibilities, no in right is my possibilities.
 tobk: mark7 keep track of both mines and torpedos, yours and opponents, and add up the damage for all cells, then compare those to the actual damage inflicted
 mark7: Okay means, I should check damage by both possibilities? and only remove possibilities that didnt occur in any situation?
 mark7: tobk
 chucknorris: read this postmortem. most of us use something like this to locate the enemy
 chucknorris: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Wondev-Woman-Postmortem/blob/master/Agade_WW_Postmortem.md">https://github.com/Agade09/Agade-Wondev-Woman-Postmortem/blob/master/Agade_WW_Postmortem.md</a>
 mark7: chucknorris thanks
 tobk: let's say you trigger a mine at 3/3, opp sends a torpedo to 4/4 and surfaces, than the cell 3/3 gets 4 damage.
 mark7: Okay now I understood
 mark7: remove op that has less than = 6 life
 mark7: but Now i need to rewrite whole tracking system, bcoz I only store op path 
 mark7: remove op with  0 lif *
 MichelLaviron: is there a known algorithm for going through as many tiles as possible without surfacing&#160;?
 MichelLaviron: is there a known algorithm for going through as many tiles as possible without surfacing&#160;?
 wlesavo: you dont really need one

 Nerchio: I worked 6 hours doing tracking i am so bad at this 
 AntiSquid: shubhamGoswami don't post clash links in chat please @_@
 Nerchio: it works now but it breaks if enemy uses too many silence :D
 AntiSquid: it's bad enough people get spammed invites
 AntiSquid: if anyone likes that stuff they will join it otherwise no need to pester people with it shubhamGoswami
 Astrobytes: Yeah he spammed it in 2 discordd channels too
 Astrobytes: *discord
 AntiSquid: well done Nerchio, now you can get bronze maybe :D
 AntiSquid: just add silence in wood 1
 Nerchio: I am in bronze :P
 AntiSquid: ah
 AntiSquid: nvm sorry :p
 Nerchio: that's why I needed to do a bigger step since my bot was fairly random
 AntiSquid: you could do a cut off, when you have way too many just limit it
 Nerchio: and now it tracks quite well 
 Nerchio: after I added tracking for some reason my bot moves into islands now
 Nerchio: #programming 
 Nerchio: woops
 pb4: Can anbody suggest an opponent against which to test who lays mine everywhere&#160;?
 pb4: Preferably a weak opponent since I have disabled all evasion code and would like to see long games anyway :D
 wlesavo: lol
 2571540: Kannely?
 2571540: Pb4
 pb4: Thanks, exactly what I'm looking for&#160;:)
 2571540: Sorry for double messages my xmmp app looks buggy
 2571540: My code could work too but idk how this version is doing
 2571540: I'm trying to increase the map coverage of mines but it's not working as intended
 pb4: never is...
 pb4: oh
 icecream17: so here's a bug i found... whenever i trigger a mine the "explodage" occurs on two places. how would that work....
 pb4: Let's add "deterministic" to the specifications...
 pb4: weak bot, lays a lot of mines and is deterministic&#160;?
 kovi: pb4 without randomize?
 pb4: Yes
 kovi: maybe if you mine only we can consider it weak(er than normal)
 chucknorris: maybe you could alse submit a working version of your bot and comment out trigger, silence and torpedo
 2571540: I think Kannely is deterministic, isn't it?
 chucknorris: that would be useful for me as well :D 
 pb4: Would it be weak though&#160;? :japanese_ogre:
 pb4: hehe :D
 2571540: XD
 2571540: It's 100+
 chucknorris: :D
 pb4: the 100+ one can't torpedo, and doesn't try to stay stealthy
 pb4: only torpedoes allowed are for instakills
 wlesavo: pb4 if you dont shoot and trigger, probably week enough
 pb4: But yes more seriously it would be weak enough :d
 wlesavo: and if its not you can be either really proud of your old version or dissapointed in a new one :wink:
 Nerchio: I don't get to see what they power up right?
 wlesavo: right
 Nerchio: so MOVE S SILENCE is MOVE S for me
 wlesavo: exactly

 2571540: I tried to spam silence when I'm ahead
 2571540: Now when it's ahead my ai spams silence until it times out
 2571540: I'm not sure I reached my objective
 chucknorris: submisson nr806 :D 
 eulerscheZahl: right now everything is strong against me, i modified the "character" of my bot to make my mine avoidance stats fit closer to top bots
 eulerscheZahl: received 1.47 damage by mines per game
 pb4: What does that mean&#160;?
 pb4: oh
 wlesavo: at what cost?
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm at 0.49 last time i checked
 eulerscheZahl: cost = more surface :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's the next TODO
 wlesavo: lol 
 pb4: It's a hard TODO
 pb4: at least for me -_-
 eulerscheZahl: but i have bar charts in my stats now

 eulerscheZahl: downloaded 3k replaysgot blocked temporarily

 eulerscheZahl: server refused my requests
 2571540: Haha
 eulerscheZahl: Nagatwin i don't have you in my stats
 2571540: I don't need those I will do it myself someday
 eulerscheZahl: only top15
 2571540: Oh
 wlesavo: i now want to be in top10 just for the sake of seeing stats on myself at the end of marathon, to bad im probably not gonna make it
 2571540: Omw
 eulerscheZahl: for the final results i might lower the bar a bit
 2571540: I should have my Sim ready by the end of the week :p

 icecream17: whoa that data thing looks cool
 eulerscheZahl: gets more interesting when you have the comparison to other bots
 eulerscheZahl: like some are shooting torpedoes all over, while others hit all the time when they shoot
 eulerscheZahl: but do it less often
 GingerFan301: Is there still a contest on May 7th? :thinkingface:

 pincedu17: Hello everyone, i'm trying to override equals (java). It seems that it is not working. Printing error in my equals is never called when using Map::containsKey. Any clues&#160;?
 rwilson: pincedu17 - sounds like you may not have ALSO provided an overridden 'hashCode' method
 mark7: Another java problem, HashMap&lt;ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;,ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;&gt;(); not working.
 mark7: in the sense, gives null pointer Exception
 dbdr: pincedu17 to override, you need to use the same argument type
 dbdr: i.e. equals(Object)
 dbdr: a good practice is to use the @Override before the method
 pincedu17: rwilson might be right, thanks for your reactivity guys
 dbdr: that will give you a compilation error if you don't actually override another method
 pincedu17: Yeah i had no compilation error, just the containsKey() isn't using my equals
 pincedu17: stupid me to miss hashcode x)
 dbdr: blame a bad API
 mark7: How could I share some code here?
 dbdr: juste copy paste it into the chat

 mark7: first list in map is for paths, second is for mines in that paths. but I get null in last line
 AntiSquid: how long is the spring contest? is it a bot contest?
 JFB: 10 days
 pincedu17: Hashcode did the trick&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: it doesn't say 10 days here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 AntiSquid: also looks like pacman
 JFB: They say 10 days here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/63iMGOS6_u0">https://youtu.be/63iMGOS6_u0</a> 
 icecream17: Oooh a bot contest. but so few time
 AntiSquid: you have a month until it starts ^
 rwilson: mark7 - the KEY in your MAP doesn't look like it makes sense.  Double check what you're trying to do.
 AntiSquid: also if it's pacman then it will be super similar to kutulu contest&#160;:/
 rwilson: mark7 - If you're trying to build a map of all PATHS available at/from/to a given POINT then you'll want the key to be POINT not ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;
 icecream17: kutulu?
 mark7: rwilson I am using hashmap to store mines in a given path, ArrayList&lt;Arraylist&lt;point&gt;&gt; to store paths
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-of-kutulu">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-of-kutulu</a> icecream17
 rwilson: mark7 - look for PM chat
 icecream17: 4 players!?
 AntiSquid: yes
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - you just like timeouts? 
 yfprojects: AntiSquid didnt you make a pacman multi?
 AntiSquid: no
 struct: I wonder what the contest will be
 AntiSquid: this was the multi i made with 2 others <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a> yfprojects
 yfprojects: I mean a demo
 AntiSquid: that was something a staff uploaded for 5 minutes or so
 AntiSquid: member of staff *
 yfprojects: oh, do you still have the link?
 eulerscheZahl: of course JFB
 eulerscheZahl: i thought using arrays instead of lists would help my performance and reduce timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: spoiler: no
 greenthingsjump: -taps mic- 
 greenthingsjump: Is this thing on?
 AntiSquid: too loud greenthingsjump
 greenthingsjump: -sadly shuffles off stage-
 icecream17: I wish the world was simulated, and also we could program in alien....
 ItachiEU: When does one get a rank?
 greenthingsjump: If the world was simulated: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0eae2bea-7e94-4c6e-8375-fecc96e436c7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0eae2bea-7e94-4c6e-8375-fecc96e436c7</a>
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, what are you doing to your poor bot?&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: trying to fix timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: my path is a list&lt;cell&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: tried bool[] and hashset
 eulerscheZahl: both was worse
 eulerscheZahl: which confuses me
 dbdr: yes, sounds counterintuitive
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i screwed up
 dbdr: the devil might be in the details
 dbdr: yeah
 pb4: hey
 pb4: sorry for the basic question
 pb4: I usually launch python scripts this way&#160;: python myscript.py
 pb4: This closes the shell when the script is done
 pb4: I'd like to keep the shell open 
 dbdr: which OS pb4?
 pb4: I'm thinking about just writing "python" and then find a way to launch myscript.py from the python shell
 reCurse: Run it from bash?
 pb4: linux mint
 reCurse: Or whatever command line
 NotKid: How do I increase my rank&#160;?
 dbdr: python should not close your shell
 reCurse: ^
 dbdr: does not make sense
 pb4: Then maybe I used the wrong word
 dbdr: are you in a terminal?
 pb4: when i just write "python" in the terminal
 pb4: I can write python code line by line
 pb4: I'd like to lauch my script and then still interact with the variables created by the script
 mark7: okay
 dbdr: right, that's the REPL
 dbdr: yes, then you should start python first (the REPL)
 dbdr: and load your script
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5280178/how-do-i-load-a-file-into-the-python-console">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5280178/how-do-i-load-a-file-into-the-python-console</a>&#160;?
 AntiSquid: why not use jupyter notebook&#160;?
 pb4: thanks&#160;:)
 pb4: python -i myscript.py
 AntiSquid: or anaconda, it's so stupidly convinient
 AntiSquid: same effect as running a script
 pb4: I use anaconda
 dbdr: I should have lmgtfy'd it :D
 AntiSquid: so what's the difference? i don't get it
 Nerchio: i don't get it I do counter 0..1..2.. formyself which is 3 power but my weapons load only until 2 xD
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: I had googled with the wrong words :D
 dbdr: yeah, that happens
 dbdr: sometimes knowing the keywords is the hardest
 mark7: programmer - pro-googler
 mark7: :joy:
 pb4: AntiSquid&#160;: to me anaconda is a big package with many things&#160;: python, some libs, spyder, jupyter, etc...
 mark7: pb4 you are right
 pb4: using anaconda might only mean using the python version that comes bundled with anaconda&#160;?
 pb4: (which is my case)
 eulerscheZahl: my prof used to say: a programmer always is a librarian too
 AntiSquid: yes, but when you run the code in jupyter you can interact with the vars easily 
 AntiSquid: no it doesn't mean you are stuck to one version
 IjustKilledutoo: hello
 IjustKilledutoo: how is everybody here
 AntiSquid: create a new python environment and use as parameter the version of python you need to use for that new project
 AntiSquid: you can have lots of diff environments
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html</a>
 AntiSquid: conda create -n myenv python=3.6
 AntiSquid: conda activate myenv
 ParticleBeam: Now have to remember how to code in C#...
 reCurse: I'm surely a corner case but I find jupyter confusing to work with
 reCurse: Hard to know what got executed and what didn't
 reCurse: Always a mess
 kovi: best strategy is not to submit
 ThePythonian: Honestly, I've never had such trouble with Jupyter
 Astrobytes: The few times I've used it I did find it clunky, maybe just doesn't suit my workflow
 AntiSquid: few times! 
 pb4: My problem with jupyter is the difficulty to launch a bunch of code selectivly
 pb4: like, those 5 cells only
 pb4: I prefer spyder for this
 reCurse: And god forbid you restart
 AntiSquid: guess you need an extension for that pb4
 AntiSquid: btw how's your bot reCurse&#160;?
 JasperV: is there a possibility to create a private leaderboard for clash of code? to do custom clash of codes with a group and have a score with just that group? now every custom clash is individual
 eulerscheZahl: there is a slack bot for clash of code i think
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/help/codingame-slackbot">https://www.codingame.com/help/codingame-slackbot</a>
 mvgen: ':; =/§%
 eulerscheZahl: you can even select the mode there (fastest/shortest/reverse)
 Envious: yeooo
 Envious: i need help
 JasperV: very cool.
 Envious: how do you split "00:00" into hours and minumute
 Envious: minute
 Envious: in python
 JasperV: we're on ms teams though at the moment&#160;:)
 JasperV: I'll look into the bot
 Envious: nvm i got it
 AntiSquid: Envious <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+manipulate+time">https://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+manipulate+time</a>
 Kukiss: xD
 Kukiss: I have a questions too regarding OoCCan I make an action with only Silence?
 Envious: yup np, i solved it thank you though AntiSquid
 Kukiss: I thought it is mandatory to make one "MOVE" every turn
 jacek: it is&#160;:?
 Kukiss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/446604105">https://www.codingame.com/replay/446604105</a>
 Envious: is binary or
 Envious: |
 Envious: in python
 Kukiss: I just print out opponents' commands and I cannot see any with "MOVE W| SILENCE"
 JBM: it's mandatory to make one "action" per turn
 Kukiss: Ok, thanks&#160;:)
 Envious: anyone know why when i do&#160;:
 Envious: n1 | n2
 Envious: I get a number thats not binary
 Envious: assuming both are integers
 mlomb: what do you mean "not binary"
 Envious: oh i think its converting to decimal
 Envious: binary as in 0 or 1
 rwilson: n1 | n2 is binary in terms of the bits.. but the result is still going to be an INT
 Envious: so if i do 0001 and 0110
 Envious: if i want 0111
 Envious: how would i do that
 Envious: assuming first number is n1, second is n2
 Envious: and they're both int
 Envious: actually lets say string
 Envious: so would it be something like:
 Envious: bin(int(n1)|int(n2))
 Envious: but that included "0b" at the front
 mlomb: int n1 = 1; // 0001int n2 = 6; // 0110 int n3 = n1 | n2; // 0111 (7)
 Envious: except it doesnt give 0111
 Envious: it gives 111
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl gib stats :D
 Envious: a = "".join(bin(int(n_1)|int(n_2)))a.replace("0b","")
 eulerscheZahl: stats on what?
 eulerscheZahl: your bot?
 Envious: n_1 is first binary number, n_2 is second
 Nagatwin: Im in top15 now :D
 Envious: why does that code not work
 Nagatwin: joking :p
 eulerscheZahl: ah :D
 MadKnight: improve your top15 Nagatwin
 eulerscheZahl: easy to add you...
 Nagatwin: I might drown soon
 Nagatwin: could have been a lucky submit
 inoryy: what kind of stats are you tracking?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/O5QD3Ms">https://imgur.com/a/O5QD3Ms</a>
 Nagatwin: :D
 rwilson: Envious -   a = f'{n3:04b}'
 eulerscheZahl: as you see i haven't finished the UI :D
 Nagatwin: how is that compared to others&#160;?
 rwilson: Envious , assuming you want 4 bit output based on your question/example.
 eulerscheZahl: that's a secret for now, create your own stats :P
 eulerscheZahl: that's my way to analyze my bot and compare to others. sorry, i'm in contest mode and that can be an advantage
 Nagatwin: haha legit
 JBM: is contest mode allowed for a contest creator? :P
 inoryy: I like that you added the avatar
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i'm allowed to participate
 JBM: as long as you don't win
 JBM: is there even anything to win
 eulerscheZahl: i'm allowed to win
 JBM: whoa
 eulerscheZahl: honor for sure
 eulerscheZahl: glory
 JBM: how things change
 eulerscheZahl: which i already have as a hypnotoad
 inoryy: nerd points
 JBM: maybe a bunch of eternal gratitude too
 eulerscheZahl: i only knew about the game 2 days before the contest started
 eulerscheZahl: not an advantage
 JBM: 2 days' worth of advantage
 inoryy: ah so your contribution is the typical paper co-author level :P
 JBM: lol
 eulerscheZahl: 2 days that i used to extend an incomplete statement and add tooltips to the viewer
 jacek: where is that frog
 eulerscheZahl: and made the default AI stronger - but that doesn't help in my argumentation of not having any advantage
 JBM: nobody ever understood what the default ai was there for
 JBM: so that's that
 eulerscheZahl: bosses..
 eulerscheZahl: same code
 JBM: we call those boss ais
 eulerscheZahl: but indeed my contribution was small
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to work on the contest during the weekend
 eulerscheZahl: and then it started on friday already :D
 JBM: the modesty
 florinpop17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/qrIldeXkrBI">https://youtu.be/qrIldeXkrBI</a> watch us play live (and join us if you want)
 JBM: play what?
 Astrobytes: CoC I believe
 AntiSquid: COC
 AntiSquid: JBM they are playing COC
 JBM: oh
 JBM: what a letdown
 Astrobytes: With donations...
 JBM: donations?!
 JBM: CoC?!
 JBM: i feel like i'm getting old
 Astrobytes: Apparently streaming anything entitles you to ask for donations these days
 JBM: nobody told me!
 JBM: and there i was, doing it for free
 Astrobytes: lol, now you know. You'll make millions from streaming Haskell I'm sure.
 JBM: starting... maybe later
 AntiSquid: no offense but donating money to a coc player/streamer is really stupid
 Astrobytes: I completely agree.
 JBM: i dunno
 JBM: i suppose i've yet to see it to believe it
 AntiSquid: the idea behind donations in general is to sort of appreciate/support the entertainment if you see value in it ...
 AntiSquid: never donated anything btw
 Astrobytes: Nor have I
 Astrobytes: But this guy has his donations on screen rn
 AntiSquid: there are some useful guideline videos on youtube, they ask to donate on patreon, i wouldn't mind donating for that
 AntiSquid: or i would mind donating for something that is actually entertaining on twitch (very rare occurrence)
 AntiSquid: wouldn't*
 Astrobytes: I just don't like the whole idea. If people wanna donate it's up to them, I won't judge.
 Astrobytes: Well, I will. Silently.
 AntiSquid: i guess it's like with the ads, some people leave ads on to not affect videos on youtubethen some content creators put the advert straight in the video so they get the money
 JBM: a contest creator still around?
 JBM: the converse question to the ambiguous end case doubt i had he other time just popped up in my head
 Astrobytes: Add it to the forum thread JBM
 JBM: feeling lazy
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 icecream17: Uh... help? my if statement timeouts...
 icecream17: Oh I see, nevermind
 RockyMullet: Oh god, if I shot a torpedo the same turn an enemy surfaced I though I hit him and totally screwed my data hahaha
 Ifthel: Ooh nice, I'll be sure to learn from your mistake
 RockyMullet: I fail for the greater good
 AntiSquid: i feel like starting over
 YannT: in Clojure!
 AntiSquid: if you stream clojure to silver
 YannT: well I know the theory of this game now so I'd be a stream of me googling and figuring out language things :p
 JBM: i can live with that
 AntiSquid: same
 Astrobytes: You have to charge 1 euro per 10 minutes
 AntiSquid: alternatively implement it in Lisp and run it locally
 JBM: clojure is a lisp
 Astrobytes: Tho it ith
 AntiSquid: so it's a fair alternative
 Nagatwin: is legend opening the 17th&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 10th
 Nagatwin: rofl
 Nagatwin: cache miss rofl
 AntiSquid: 1 week of legend
 Nagatwin: thanks
 AntiSquid: you can click in IDE at the top on your rank and league
 Nagatwin: yes i know
 AntiSquid: it shows next league opening during contest
 Nagatwin: but it showed 17th because of cached info
 AntiSquid: ah
 Nagatwin: How many players will be going to legend&#160;? 20 or so&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 15&#160;?
 AntiSquid: maybe 20, dunno
 Nagatwin: Ill tryto keep up
 RockyMullet: oh no, inorry passed gold&#160;! I was testing against you :P
 RockyMullet: I guess I'll have to be gold too then :triumph:
 RockyMullet: well my bug fix got me from 48th silver to 21th, theres hope
 inoryy: haha wow I got pushed over the day for ~40th place
 inoryy: from*
 RockyMullet: so youre telling me there's hope I get pushed too&#160;? :D
 RockyMullet: well I lost a lot against you, thats why I was testing against, so I might have pushed you a bit hehe
 Zenoscave: whoa top 20 is super dense right now
 Astrobytes: So am I, frankly :scream_cat:
 icecream17: uh, i pressed a random keyboard thing and now the textcursor is a yellow rectangle
 icecream17: Oh, turns out I pressed the "Insert" button. Didn't even know that existed
 Astrobytes: ...
 icecream17: I wonder what the other keys do....
 Astrobytes: I heard the 'any' key is great if you wish to continue
 icecream17: :grinning:
 icecream17: wow i've never seen the PrtSc key
 Nerchio: I just want to advance to silver and I will probably be done, my first competition and my bot became too big mess
 Nerchio: on rare occasion it breaks and debugging it is hell since there is so many paths to track
 Ifthel: If it's messy, this is a great opportunity to practice code refactoring Nerchio
 Nerchio: I am refactoring some along the waybut i would probably have to rewrite this completely to make sense haha
 Astrobytes: Still 12 days and a bit left&#160;;)
 Illedan: Yeah, too long -.-
 <b>**hhghj hello</b></p><p><img src="/a/2285651932009" /> <b>**Ifthel hi</b></p><p><img src="/a/41940089154876" /> elsinnombre2d2: hi, im new here and id like to know if it is possible to do a machine learning approach 
 elsinnombre2d2: possible= feasible
 RockyMullet: most people who try machine learning in here do it offline
 RockyMullet: aka reproduce the game outside and train it
 RockyMullet: since you cant keep data from game to game
 Ifthel: Isn't there a way to get results from online matches?
 Uljahn: you can download replays through API, then parse them
 elsinnombre2d2: and how they import the ai?
 Uljahn: ai?
 elsinnombre2d2:  Artificial Intelligence
 elsinnombre2d2: the model
 Uljahn: from __future__ import ai, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: for the sake of it
 Uljahn: ide has limit of 100k chars, so you can copy your model's weights
 icecream17: nice, turns out my code has all the letters of the alphabet
 Swagboy: Hahah noice
 MadKnight: hihi Swagboy icecream17
 MadKnight: are u guys playing contest&#160;?
 Swagboy: Yes yes quite
 Swagboy: working on a mcts
 MadKnight: how're u gonna use mcts here&#160;?
 Swagboy: with branches weighted with probability of game states
 Swagboy: But i'm still at the mcts-0 part
 icecream17: oh hi yes im playing contest
 icecream17: I just found a huge bug, lucky me
 icecream17: unlucky me, i lost the first 8 games in a row
 rwilson: icecream17 , but now... can you squish the bug quickly and get your bot doing better&#160;;)  ... ( or worse&#160;:( sometime )
 icecream17: i'm not even sure there's a bug....
 icecream17: oh wait nevermind
 Swagboy: There was a bug or not then?
 icecream17: many many bugs
 icecream17: unbelievable

 ivanmusa: hey
 DerMert: üòéüòé
 ivanmusa: sup?
 NuclearMutant_7b24: hey
 ivanmusa: how r u
 rylle: how to use this
 Pointer123: .
 derjack: meh i dont get the connect4. the submitted version just got lucky
 FSMaxB: The codingame people aren't very good with rust it seems. Their input parsing code is horrible
 derjack: rust :scream:
 FSMaxB: They use a parse_input! macro, which can easily be a regular generic function instead!
 derjack: the generated stub?
 FSMaxB: Yes, the generated stub.
 Benji-the-scripter:    Hello
 Benji-the-scripter: Day seven i think im here! One week done =)
 FSMaxB: I'm trying to find out who to contact to fix the autogenerated code into more idiomatic rust. Probably somewhere on GitHub ...
 [CG]Thibaud: you can check existing posts in the forum
 [CG]Thibaud: if you don't find one, you can create a new post FSMaxB
 FSMaxB: :thumbsup:
 [CG]Thibaud: keep in mind that we have some constraints for the generated code so your proposal could be a good one but not adapted to CG.
 Benji-the-scripter: Someone knows how to fix (next_checkpoint_angel)?
 [CG]Thibaud: mainly we don't write all default code for each puzzle. We have a tool that generates the code for each language from one stub
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Benji-the-scripter: just wondered how they work a little
 FSMaxB: Yes, but my proposal should work with autogenerated code without any problems. I'll make a new forum post.
 [CG]Thibaud:&#160;:+1:
 FSMaxB: The forum post is done. And I want to apologize for the world "horrible" earlier. The code could be improved but it definitely isn't horrible.
 Bad_Breath: What am I missing in coders strike back? 
 Bad_Breath: Its literally not moving or anything? am I not reading correctly? 
 derjack: is that X Y, Y Y thing?
 Bad_Breath: Yea its not responding to literally ANYTHING I know for sure what X and Y are so im just confused on why it wont move at all
 derjack: does it crash or something
 Bad_Breath: It just sits still I dont even think this works
 derjack: screen or video&#160;:?
 HelloHiHello: Bad_Breath
 HelloHiHello: lol
 HelloHiHello: funny name
 Bad_Breath: This is a horrible way of teaching I dont even know what to do 
 HelloHiHello: I agree
 Manopphysics: It's over Anakin
 Bad_Breath: ^^^ Im seriously sitting here staring at whats supposed to be a tutorial about to scream because I know for sure this is missing something THEY SHOULD EXPLAIN BETTER 
 derjack: what is your code so far
 Bad_Breath: cout &lt;&lt; nextCheckpointX &lt;&lt; "8000" &lt;&lt; nextCheckpointY &lt;&lt; "4500" &lt;&lt; thrust &lt; 100 &lt;&lt; endl;
 Bad_Breath: Now its straight up saying I dont know what im doing
 Bad_Breath: But I cant even see my error because of this dumb big ass tutorial box 
 Benji-the-scripter: "8000" and "4500" to much
 Bad_Breath: I DONT CARE IM TRYING TO MAKE IT MOVE AT ALL 
 Benji-the-scripter: only up to 100
 Benji-the-scripter: to mpve
 Benji-the-scripter: move*
 Bad_Breath: 10 dont work 50 dont work NOTHING WORKS 
 Benji-the-scripter: u doing coder strikes back?
 Benji-the-scripter: or not
 Bad_Breath: yES
 Bad_Breath:  The game is 16000 by 9000 so its not too much 
 Benji-the-scripter: first task or second?
 Bad_Breath: first 
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Benji-the-scripter: let me explain
 Benji-the-scripter: change it to default
 Bad_Breath: Ok
 Benji-the-scripter: so dont change any of the code
 Benji-the-scripter: then choose "python 3" coding language
 Benji-the-scripter: do you know how to do?
 Bad_Breath: Im working with C++ but i have worked with it
 Benji-the-scripter: change to python 3 for easier
 Benji-the-scripter: then
 derjack: cout &lt;&lt; (rand()%5000) &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; (rand()%5000) &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; 100 &lt;&lt; endl;
 Benji-the-scripter: wut+
 Benji-the-scripter:&#160;?
 derjack: and see if it moves at all
 Bad_Breath: It didnt move but it ran longer
 Benji-the-scripter: private chat with me @bad_breath
 RoboStac: if you click the share button  (middle on bottom right) does it work on the new tab&#160;?
 Alshock: no offence @Benji-the-scripter but from what I read I don't think you might be very good at explaining stuff
 Bad_Breath: At this point im just angry theres no solution for what is supposed to be apart of a tutorial that I dont even wanna work on
 Bad_Breath: This is lame 
 ProCoder03: Codingame was never a place to teach you coding, It was and still, is a place to improve your existing skills
 ProCoder03: I think CG need to do something like what codewars
 Benji-the-scripter: I wont chat much anymore, i think it is for my best :disappointed:
 Bad_Breath: well I already am learning code without this site I just thought it boring to keep running through meaningless exercises without knowing what im reallly getting out of it 
 Bad_Breath: So I came to this place because I knew it had stuff for me to do that wasnt so boring but no, lets go through a stupid tutorial that cannot be skipped
 Bad_Breath: Super intuitive design there
 Bad_Breath: Nobody asked for a fuckin teacher 
 Bad_Breath: I asked for a solution to something that should reasonably have one, but nah its dog shit 
 Westicles: dude, just change the Y to X
 Bad_Breath: LOL I did 
 Benji-the-scripter: I tried to help u, U DID not know that 
 Westicles: and 50 to 100.  don't change anything else
 Benji-the-scripter: I said that to him
 Benji-the-scripter: before
 Bad_Breath: Yes I did know that I can literally prove it in our dms wtf? 
 Benji-the-scripter: I wish a moderater saw u swearing
 Bad_Breath: Brah you didnt even help me 
 Bad_Breath: You sent me to google and youtube 
 Bad_Breath: Stop it
 Benji-the-scripter: I tried
 Bad_Breath: And I thanked you 
 Benji-the-scripter: and it was not real
 Bad_Breath: WOW OK 
 Benji-the-scripter: Bad_Breath 01:52PMBrah you didnt even help me You sent me to google and youtube Stop it
 Benji-the-scripter: LOL
 Bad_Breath: I said you shot me in the right direction 
 Bad_Breath: Wtf 
 Benji-the-scripter: No i did not
 Benji-the-scripter: Bad_Breath 01:52PMBrah you didnt even help me 
 Bad_Breath: ok so you wanna fight? 
 darkhorse64: stop that please or PM
 Benji-the-scripter: No
 ProCoder03: Would mind moving to #fighting if you want
 Bad_Breath: Brah im looking for the solution for this dumb ass game
 ProCoder03: If you want to search for solutions in google for these games, then why do are you here&#160;??
 Benji-the-scripter: I just wanted to help you @bad_breath but not any of that was for any help, you lied to me!
 Westicles: I told you what to do.  move on if you can't manage it
 Benji-the-scripter: Gtg i dont want fight
 Bad_Breath: I like how literally all of you are fucked in the head 
 Bad_Breath: So I came here to STRENGHTEN A SKILL YEA?!?!?
 Benji-the-scripter: STOP SWEARING!
 Bad_Breath: So naturally if something is too much, there hsould be idk a HINT!?!?
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: do the thing
 Automaton2000: you would be more efficient to just have a really good idea
 Westicles: where is Blaise the mod we need you!
 TheBlueBias: There's no such ting here...
 darkhorse64: gone in limbo
 Bad_Breath: No wait lets go back 
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: for once, i agree with you
 ProCoder03: B4 him, we need a server reboot :laughing:
 Automaton2000: you can run the same code that was in the top 100
 Bad_Breath: Im here to google search solutions right? 
 Bad_Breath: Dope I asked a question 
 Bad_Breath: I should just leave right? 
 darkhorse64: please stop that
 Bad_Breath: You people are worst than the teachers I have to deal with 
 TheBlueBias: Good vibes here... ~o~
 ProCoder03: Well, I thought Google was your teacher 
 Bad_Breath: It is because programming professors like you are dog shit 
 Bad_Breath: Mot of us are googling what to do 
 Bad_Breath: Thanks for people like you man youre the best 
 Elives: I'm new here, Hello everyone!:grinning:
 ProCoder03: Hello Elives
 Alshock: @Bad_BreathHello, you're probably stuck because you can't read the expected output. Thank you for your time.
 Bad_Breath: I just did it and i dont even know how 
 TheAtomicSconeInSpace_724f: Hey guys
 Bad_Breath: And the tutorial box does indeed block out the output box so I had literally no information of anything
 Alshock: the expectation is written in the rules, not in the outputs
 Alshock: Glad you managed to move around somehow
 TheAtomicSconeInSpace_724f: :slight_smile:
 TheAtomicSconeInSpace_724f: Hey guys
 ProCoder03: :wave:
 [CG]Thibaud: Bad_Breath first warning, calm down
 Bad_Breath: Honestly ill probably never use this chat again based on the humans ive interacted with go ahead and drop the hammer my man
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: Wassup guys
 [CG]Thibaud: you're the angry one, others have been trying to help
 TimothyAlexisVass:&#160;:\
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: they should explain better!
 Automaton2000: are there any other way
 JacobTheCoder: —Ü–∞–Ω —ã–æ—É —Å–ø–µ–∞–∫ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∏–∞–Ω?
 ProCoder03: English here JacobTheCoder
 ProCoder03: for russian go to #ru
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: This Bad_Breath guy is crazy XD
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: Those tutorials are nice
 Bad_Breath: Lol the tutorial are garbage water
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: its because u are bad
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: XD
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: start with easier tutorials
 Shurishe: Sometimes there are problems with page markup may be he just have one of them
 Bad_Breath: I am but theyre worst
 JacobTheCoder: my english bad
 Shurishe: preventing page from normal renderring. Once I had to dig into dev console and remove elements just ot post messsage here
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: u learned from it
 JacobTheCoder: but i can try yes?
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: yes
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: ofc
 JacobTheCoder: i try .lua but its broke how fix?
 JacobTheCoder: it no run
 ProCoder03: which puzzle&#160;??
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: maybe u got any "}" too much?
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: or ")" are missing
 JacobTheCoder: i using }
 FSMaxB: Lua doesn't use { or }, they use words like "end" or "then"
 JacobTheCoder: yeah but it end}
 JacobTheCoder: thats what like
 WaterCooledFrenchman_11e1: ah okay i see
 Bad_Breath: So ok I was having issues with my code again which I thought was simple I refreshed the page and it worked
 ProCoder03: :thinking:
 Bad_Breath: Im not crying any more im just putting that out there
 FSMaxB: Is there any way to make your own library functions that can be reused across challenges (other than simple copy and paste).
 Uljahn: no
 JacobTheCoder: hi
 ZombieRobotFromTheSwamps_65f2: hi
 ZombieRobotFromTheSwamps_65f2: hows it popin
 ZombieRobotFromTheSwamps_65f2: go listen to whats popin on spotify

 TimothyAlexisVass: :ok_hand:
 TimothyAlexisVass: Congratulations for being good Jacob
 AdolfSenpai: helo
 JacobTheCoder: hi
 JacobTheCoder: im in school and it sucks &gt;:(
 ProCoder03: That's why we have CG :wink:
 JacobTheCoder:&#160;?
 Uljahn: the place where coding is fun
 JacobTheCoder: im no good at coding though
 r8_the_gmoo: your name would suggest otherwise
 baileyyware: currently coding while in english class lmaoo
 eulerscheZahl: you have English keywords like "if", "for", "while". maybe even "class" if you write OOP codeso that's enough English
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are a native speaker, aren't you? then i can't give you full credit on it
 baileyyware: what
 r8_the_gmoo: could also account for variable names being commonly in english
 eulerscheZahl: int i, double d :smirk:
 TimothyAlexisVass: try to catch the long case, except when switch for double if true = false...
 eulerscheZahl: if true is falseat least in C# "is" is also a keyword
 eulerscheZahl: equivalent to Java's instanceof
 JacobTheCoder: of...
 TimothyAlexisVass: true
 JacobTheCoder: someone pm me a good website to learn coding&#160;:(
 TimothyAlexisVass: What language do you want to learn?
 eulerscheZahl: why not here, then we all get a few pointers?
 JacobTheCoder: oh
 TimothyAlexisVass: This is a good place to learn how to code...
 JacobTheCoder: i dont know where to find it
 JacobTheCoder:&#160;??
 TimothyAlexisVass: What do you mean?
 JacobTheCoder: as in where do i go to learn it
 [CG]Thibaud: Codecademy
 Himekawalg: :eyes:
 JacobTheCoder: its blocked &gt;:(
 JacobTheCoder: REEEE
 TimothyAlexisVass: Is there any programming language that has a median function?
 TimothyAlexisVass: for arrays
 JacobTheCoder: no idea but im trying to learn .lua
 JacobTheCoder: gtg
 JacobTheCoder: seeya
 TimothyAlexisVass: numpy has it...
 eulerscheZahl: R also has median
 Jali98: hiii
 Jali98: :v:
 TimothyAlexisVass: Oh
 baileyyware: guys i think i just pooped my pants
 baileyyware: kidding 
 TimothyAlexisVass: :thinking:
 baileyyware: guys im in study hall and its so boring 
 TimothyAlexisVass: So R has median and Python+numpy has median, any other?
 baileyyware: huh
 baileyyware: idk how to code im just on here to talk to people ahaha

 baileyyware: two pickels fell out of a jar onto the floor, what did they say to eachother?
 baileyyware: dill with it.
 baileyyware: why did the dinosaur cross the road
 baileyyware: because the chicken didnt exist yet
 JacobTheCoder: „Ö§
 baileyyware: how do you get a squirrel to like you
 baileyyware: act like a nut
 JacobTheCoder: dad joke lol
 JacobTheCoder: any tips for .lua coding???
 baileyyware: i dont know how to code lolll
 JacobTheCoder: oof
 baileyyware: big oof
 MiyamuraIzumi: huge oof
 JacobTheCoder: im trying to make a custom mod menu to ruin kids on roblox but im too bad, all ive developed was a auto click and rebirth machine
 JacobTheCoder: for a clicking game
 MiyamuraIzumi: never code Lua
 JacobTheCoder: oof
 d33pb1ue: oof
 JacobTheCoder: im trying to get someone to help me so i can start selling it on github
 JacobTheCoder: where is the best place to prctice coding on this site??
 MiyamuraIzumi: try with the easy puzzle
 JacobTheCoder: i cant find them XD
 MiyamuraIzumi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 JacobTheCoder: :O
 JacobTheCoder: thanks
 baileyyware: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sites.google.com/site/slopeunblockedgame/">https://sites.google.com/site/slopeunblockedgame/</a>
 baileyyware: that game is so addciting
 baileyyware: everyone go play it
 baileyyware: ^^
 JacobTheCoder: i like how it says "blocked game"
 MiyamuraIzumi: you can just solve the puzzle JacobTheCoder
 baileyyware: it says unblocked because most schools have it blocked like on their computers haha
 JacobTheCoder: ahh
 JacobTheCoder: @miryamuralzumi i cant&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;?
 JacobTheCoder: i dont know how to code 
 MiyamuraIzumi: well then find a tutorial then
 JacobTheCoder: where
 MiyamuraIzumi: anywhere on google
 JacobTheCoder: what do i need to look for
 MiyamuraIzumi: something like "lua tutorial"
 MiyamuraIzumi: or "learning Lua"
 JacobTheCoder: ok one sec
 JacobTheCoder: sis "power of thor" considered to be .lua?
 JacobTheCoder: is*
 MiyamuraIzumi: you can solve it by any language you want
 MiyamuraIzumi: you can choose Lua
 TheBlueBias: Or Brainfuck!
 MiyamuraIzumi: CG doesn't sp BrainFuck
 TheBlueBias: Code your own bf interpreter in lua, put it in the ide, and solve thor with bf! \o/
 JacobTheCoder: ahhh
 JacobTheCoder: ok
 JacobTheCoder: its on JS
 TheBlueBias: What's on JS?
 JacobTheCoder: "power of thor" i had to change the language to .lua
 TheBlueBias: Oh. Yeah.
 JacobTheCoder: im new to coding so i have no idea what im doing&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: learn on tutorial first
 JacobTheCoder: o
 MiyamuraIzumi: I don't think you should jump right into puzzle like that
 JacobTheCoder: is that on my profile??
 JacobTheCoder: well i know coding just not ya know
 JacobTheCoder: making a whole new code from scratch
 JacobTheCoder: but yeah
 New_at_Coding: Same
 New_at_Coding: I'm having a hard time playing the games because of it
 JacobTheCoder: i use a app that when somethink happens like when you click it will write the code for you, it really saves time
 JacobTheCoder: sometimes*
 JacobTheCoder: frick
 JacobTheCoder: something*
 TheBlueBias: Paper and pen are your friends.
 JacobTheCoder: welll
 JacobTheCoder: i wouldnt say that
 JacobTheCoder: how am i top 43%
 eulerscheZahl: playing clash of code gave you a few points
 JacobTheCoder: o
 JacobTheCoder: i didnt even code though :hmm:
 MiyamuraIzumi: other are dead account or those that doesn't code at all
 JacobTheCoder: o
 JacobTheCoder: F
 JacobTheCoder: i may wait till im out of school

 jacek: good evening
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday's eve
 darkhorse64: jacek, your bot times out at CTTT
 LagunaElectric: :D
 LagunaElectric: All the school kids on Codeingame lol
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse64 because I suggested changing the size so that there's an even number of cells. Now it's 10x10
 eulerscheZahl: evil toad :imp:
 darkhorse64: I noticed that and changed my bot accordingly. Do you think it will level chances for the second player&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: a bit. but also talked the creator into adding a steal
 darkhorse64: mirror matches would be better I think because what matters most is the initiative (just my gut feeling)
 eulerscheZahl: let's consider an extreme case: the game is so biased that p1 has a 100% winrate. then it's always a draw for mirrors
 eulerscheZahl: we have this situation at UTTT (less extreme of course)
 darkhorse64: at the end, if we sum scores to decide the winner, draws are unlikely
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I didn't think that far. I was just thinking in terms of win/loss
 eulerscheZahl: he just popped up on discord. I admit I didn't even read all the comments to the contribution. Feel free to make it a comment in case it isn't there already
 darkhorse64: in fireworks, the scoring is done like that. It has been suggested in the comments
 jacek: good thing i havent bitboarded it (yet)
 eulerscheZahl: right, same for code a la mode
 darkhorse64: premature optimization is the root of all evil :smiling_imp:
 eulerscheZahl: the mouse is back
 eulerscheZahl: sneaking into my room through the open window
 darkhorse64: and the cat is sleeping
 eulerscheZahl: well, yes
 eulerscheZahl: just 5m away
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday she even saw a mouse when we were outside. but quickly lost it while chasing
 darkhorse64: fine, she still able has the will to do it even she lacks practice
 eulerscheZahl: she just got up, setting next to the window now
 eulerscheZahl: let's see if the mouse comes a 3rd time
 eulerscheZahl: already took 2 peanuts
 darkhorse64: she has seen something to play with
 jacek: ok, testing 10x10, but so far it seems p1 still has huge advantage
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse64 suggested mirror and counting the sum of score points
 jacek: from both games, regardless who won?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 darkhorse64: yep
 Zenoscave: Ahem. PEW PEW
 eulerscheZahl: pew pew pew
 Zenoscave: Just saw the next contest is up. 
 eulerscheZahl: it's not
 eulerscheZahl: maybe next spring
 Zenoscave: Like announced i mean
 struct: contest?
 eulerscheZahl: escape room contest
 Zenoscave: eh?
 eulerscheZahl: takes 1-3h to finish
 Zenoscave: no. 
 Zenoscave: no.
 Zenoscave: no.
 jacek: eeyup
 Zenoscave: AFK BRB in spring.
 eulerscheZahl: yes, we don't count that as a contest here
 struct: my chances of winning a tshirt went from 1% to 0% 
 Zenoscave: All I want is one t-shirt
 eulerscheZahl: why? they might even have increased
 struct: because I wont join
 eulerscheZahl: i see. me neither
 Zenoscave: out of principle. I probably won't either
 eulerscheZahl: so i won't take a tshirt away from you
 Zenoscave: How hard are the escapes? Never did one
 Zenoscave: Can you solo 'em?
 eulerscheZahl: did a half one, then got tired and bored
 struct: they are meant to be team based
 struct: The coding requirement is clash level
 struct: and you only really need 1 coder
 Zenoscave: Yeah... no thanks
 TheBlueBias: :zipper_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1udsl3f">https://prnt.sc/1udsl3f</a>i have a feeling that this poll might become relevant
 jacek: lets make bots for that poll
 jacek: it was the plan all along
 Zenoscave: I'm on it. Have nothing to do this weekend
 Zenoscave: DurationApproximately 168h, depending on the time spent cracking the different codes.
 Zenoscave: That's laughable
 eulerscheZahl: they want to change that
 struct: I dont mind having an escape contest
 struct: but having only 1 bot programming contest is too little
 struct: it went from 4 per year
 struct: to 2
 struct: to 1
 eulerscheZahl: just not as a substitute. they can co-exist
 casmith789: what is going on with the escape room - will it take 168h to finish or do you have 7 days to do it
 eulerscheZahl: staff says 1-3h to complete it
 casmith789: oh
 Zenoscave: Is there a lack of devs working for CG now? Why can't they keep even  2 a year?
 eulerscheZahl: open for 7 days. but leaderboard takes time from the beginning of hte contest
 eulerscheZahl: it's more of a strategic decision
 eulerscheZahl: promotion a new format that they want to sell to companies
 Zenoscave: Yeah how's that working out
 struct: we will have to wait and see
 struct: ofc some users will dislike it
 struct: but I guess some dont mind
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1udthdq">https://prnt.sc/1udthdq</a>and that's how discord reacts to the news
 Zenoscave: "Some"
 casmith789: I like the escape rooms in general but don't like the timing aspect or replacements of bot contests
 Westicles: TheBlueBias, did you have all your solutions stored offline?
 TheBlueBias: Thanks the Hell, yes...
 Westicles: Ah, not so bad then.
 Westicles: nobody wants to do hornSAT twice
 JacobTheCoder: I DID IT
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you completely deleted your old account?
 JacobTheCoder: IT TOOK MY WHOLE CLASS
 JacobTheCoder: but i did it
 JacobTheCoder: :D
 Zenoscave: who's taking my ideas now? Deleting accounts again?
 JacobTheCoder: no idea
 JacobTheCoder: but i made my own GUI
 Zenoscave: bluebias new name whodis

 TheBlueBias: Yes. Blaise's dead. I'll just sitt here and look the whole thing collapsing with some :popcorn:
 Zenoscave: mind sharing the popcorn?
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 <b>**TheBlueBias send mental :popcorn: to Zenoscave.</b>
 Zenoscave: :beer: In return
 TheBlueBias: :beers:
 Prof_Doom: should i consider myself good enough if i reach level 25 or that's just easy 
 Zenoscave: good sure. but never good enough. enough for what? To stop getting better? never.
 Prof_Doom: yeah obviously 
 Prof_Doom: I'll set my current goal at 25
 darkhorse64: set your goal to guru
 struct: get rank 1 on csb
 eulerscheZahl: that's harder than getting rank 1 in global
 Prof_Doom: totally happening 
 DoubleOracle: what algorithms are the top solutions in csb using?
 eulerscheZahl: neural networks
 eulerscheZahl: below that some monte carlo tree search, minimax, genetic algorithms
 eulerscheZahl: in short: complicated stuff that's not that simple to pull off
 Prof_Doom: meural networks are out of my league, and i don't feel like learning for now, guess I'll play around with genetic algorithms
 Prof_Doom: neural*
 DoubleOracle: yeah, I don't see an obvious way how to use the input from csb in  neural network - other than just using them directly as inputs
 MarcMarcMarcMarc: what is csb&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: coders strike back, a racing game on this website
 Prof_Doom: btw i haven't solved a single bot programming challenge till now properly because i feel too lazy
 eulerscheZahl: especially for CSB top players have worked many months on their bots
 jacek: you can try simpler bots - connect4, bandas, onitama
 Prof_Doom: actually I'll just give the ones i attempted a shot, since the last time i tried was 2 years ago, left codingame after that
 Prof_Doom: why is it when my exams are approaching i have this urge to do everything but study for exams
 permperm: My apartment is spotless during exam preparations
 jacek: hmm i have trouble loading counting ttt replays. it stops at 82 
 JacobTheCoder: hi!
 JacobTheCoder: ust got to test my GUI and everything works :D
 JacobTheCoder: just*
 struct: have you tried refreshing?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: it works eventually. it stops at 82 for a while
 JacobTheCoder: oml
 JacobTheCoder: just tried to do a challenge, failed miserably
 JacobTheCoder: welp my computer is going to die good bye&#160;:)
 jacek: oO
 PulseOsm: sup I do C++ i be making an fps  
 CSHARPDEV: noice
 CSHARPDEV: i like unity c#
 Wontonimo: anyone know a good c++ source code obfuscater&#160;?
 PulseOsm: I use unreal 5
 TheBlueBias: Why obfuscating?
 PulseOsm: actullay its more third person but you switch
 jacek: Wontonimo why would you obfuscate c++ code?
 Wontonimo: i'm paranoid 
 Husoski: Why would you *need* to obfuscate C++ code?&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: fair enough
 struct: but for cg?
 Wontonimo: for wood 2 bot in counting ttt.  i'd like to contribute my bot, but it's got a lot of my personal mcts code in it 
 jacek: ask mark winands to pseudocode your code and your good to go :v
 jacek: (the guy from mcts solver paper)
 struct: I dont think many people know about it Wontonimo
 TheBlueBias: I can obfuscate it for you, just send me the code.
 Wontonimo: well, i did it manually.  now it is just barf code to read.  most variable names converted to jyx or crd ...
 struct: hard to believe that he wrote that awful code
 Wontonimo: who?
 struct: winands
 struct: The mcts solver code
 Wontonimo: ah, yeah
 struct: Maybe you could try this Wontonimo
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://stunnix.com/prod/cxxo/">http://stunnix.com/prod/cxxo/</a>
 struct: no https 
 Wontonimo: yeah, thanks
 Wontonimo: it's done (enough) now
 struct: ah ok
 Wontonimo: someone could definitely just use a code formatter and make an educated guess at the variable and function names and completely rebuild it 
 Wontonimo: but that would probably take longer it is worth
 Wontonimo: i'm happy with it now
 Illedan: Hi
 struct: hi
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: very nice job
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: It shouldn't be too much of an issue tbh, it's a limited group of people who are aware. And not likely to pilfer it or share.Obfuscate if you wish though&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: thanks
 Astrobytes: (Take off, nuke the site from orbit, the only way to be sure :P )
 Wontonimo: Global Thermo Nuclear Destruction 
 Astrobytes: Launching intercontinental ballistic missiles with :taco: warheads 
 Illedan: Drop one here plz
 Illedan: I need tacos
 Astrobytes: &lt;Taco launch detected&gt;

 Illedan: :boom:
 Astrobytes: Poor cat. Dressed like a taco and being forced to look at a ... what in hell is that anyway
 Illedan: You forgot the avocado&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Meh. Lost on re-entry probably :P
 Illedan: Hope the space station gets to enjoy it
 jacek: avocato?
 Wontonimo: love the taco jokes :grin:
 Astrobytes: I'm still traumatised by that taco-design thing in a leaf
 Illedan: I find that tacotastic
 BrandonPetersen: knock knock
 Ryan_Brighton: whose there?
 BrandonPetersen: kanga
 Wontonimo: no

 JBM: just did
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: JBM you need a profile pic!  
 JBM: do i
 Wontonimo: not with that attitude, better to not have a pic
 miszu: so in my c++ code I am appending my string with only 4 possible values "LUDR". However I get some weird character in outputs sometimes
 miszu: like a diamond shaped character
 miszu: which I have no idea how it landed there
 jacek: no end character?
 jacek: or out of bounds index reading memory
 miszu: so for my graph I like to print the whole path
 miszu: and I get unknown command: \0

 skotz: does anyone know how to submit a bug fix to a community submission that's already been approved?
 RoboStac: assuming it's the same for your own contributions as it is for high levels there is a 'view contribution' link on the ide page that lets you get to the edit page
 skotz: ah, ok. so i just edit the original submission
 RoboStac: yeah
 ProCoder03: Morning
 miszu: hello, how people in the 2048 game could get millions of points?
 miszu: i barely made 400k points and I don't see how can you exponentially have it higher
 ProCoder03: using Simulations, I presume
 miszu: there is a max of 600 moves. I don't see how you can have 10x more points
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/583788219">https://www.codingame.com/replay/583788219</a>
 Astrobytes: Offline
 miszu: what you mean offline?
 Astrobytes: Recreate the game offline, run your search algo there, upload fixed inputs for the validators
 miszu: wait so I can do more than 600 moves?
 Astrobytes: miszu: For technical limitations you can only output 600 commands per game. To allow for longer games, you can print multiple actions at once
 miszu: omg...
 miszu: brb
 miszu: 8.3 million as score
 miszu: finally
 miszu: I am still surprised that it can't handle so many string
 miszu: even a string of length of 20 becomes an issue
 Wontonimo: hey miszu, your rank is really climbing!  congrats
 Cegwe: im on the quest to do shortest mode clash of code wins, what language is good for that?
 Cegwe: Also Wontonimo I beat your bot on counting tictactoe&#160;:)
 abt8601: Generally Ruby is the strongest in shortest. Python is also good.
 Cegwe: Sweet I'll look into ruby thanks
 miszu: Wontonimo thank you&#160;:) it was a silly mistake
 Nexuss: hello

 Shadowtick: hello I can help you with anything javascript that I know how to do
 Gryja: im learning python, but thanks
 Shadowtick: and my name is shadowtick  :3
 Gryja: im doing first game with mountains and im kinda confused
 Shadowtick: ok I will shoot you a message
 KiwiTae: Gryja how so hehe
 AntiSquid: for loop @Gryja
 Gryja: the default code that the site gives me i dont t understand
 Gryja: input means thats someone should input somethinghow does the code work if noubody is inputing anything
 KiwiTae: hahaa
 Gryja: is the site itself placing random inputs?
 KiwiTae: when u press play testcase , they send you the input
 Metanoob: Gryja, exactly yes! Not exactly random, they are crafted by the author
 Gryja: Height of mountain 0&#160;: 9Height of mountain 1&#160;: 8.... 
 Gryja: is thhis what site inputs?
 Gryja: oh i see 
 Gryja: Standard Output Stream:5

 Gryja: is this it&#160;?
 Uljahn: don't hesitate to read hints on the left
 Metanoob: yes Gryja
 KiwiTae: oh damn so many hints they do it well
 Gryja: i read all of them ..
 Gryja: ok i understand now that the site is inserting inputs by itself
 Monstrux: did u try to check the inputs with console.error(smthg)&#160;?
 Gryja: and it shows ind the "console output"
 KiwiTae: yea all is  executed on the server
 Astrobytes: yes, just imagine you're reading the inputs straight from stdin
 Gryja: okay that clears is
 NotNick.: gryja are you on the shooting the mountain level&#160;?
 Gryja: yes 
 Shadowtick: Gryja I have your told you how to fix yours
 NotNick.: try using  a variable that is determined by scanning  the 
 Gryja: so .. whenever i have some code that requires input , the site is the one that is going to fill that input in&gt;
 Uljahn: also debug print is your best friend
 Astrobytes: yes
 NotNick.: ^
 KiwiTae: print("hekllo",file=sys.stderr) in python i think
 Astrobytes: Imagine it's giving you a text file every turn and you're reading the data from there
 Gryja: okay , thank you all, ill practice more
 NotNick.: Good luck!
 KiwiTae: Gryja take it slow gonna work out jia you
 Astrobytes: yeah, no rush when you're learning

 JJ124: i would recommend watching just the first two lectures of CS50
 JJ124: from harvard
 AntiSquid: sololearn quick fast easy .
 NotNick.: I did finish a uni degree in CSE but these type of exercises are nothing similar with what i used to do.
 AntiSquid: really?

 AntiSquid: idk maybe you're just confused by the starter code?
 AntiSquid: read it carefully? did you do onboarding?
 NotNick.: Managed to make one of them but tried others and had no success.
 HelloWorld183L: i've seen experienced software engineers get confused by Codingame at times
 AntiSquid: which one did you try 
 HelloWorld183L: because it can be that different from what they are used to doing
 NotNick.: i  managed to complete the one with the ship shooting the mountains
 AntiSquid: well i am starting to wonder what they were doing lol
 NotNick.: it was pretty straight forward.
 NotNick.: but now im on the one with the temps and im confused since i didn't work with arrays much.
 AntiSquid: if CG is confusing then so is every other puzzle site which usually has more active people doing puzzles afaik
 HelloWorld183L: not puzzle sites, i'm talking about their day to day jobs
 AntiSquid: same issue, you got to learn the code base when you start a new job 
 HelloWorld183L: yes
 Astrobytes: Wait you did a computer science and engineering degree and didn't learn about arrays?
 Astrobytes: NotNick.
 NotNick.: we did learn about them , but not really used them.
 Astrobytes: Oh, all theory no coding
 HelloWorld183L: lack of practical experience it seems
 NotNick.: +
 Astrobytes: Well, get practising. It'll come 
 NotNick.: we were focused pretty much on microcontroller coding , simulating real life projects and such
 AntiSquid: i thought uni / college hooks you up with a company to slave some free hours so you can gain experience? and aren't there any tests?
 HelloWorld183L: what data structures did you use
 AntiSquid: microcontrollers have arrays no?
 HelloWorld183L: ^
 AntiSquid: go to codesignal &gt; developer login &gt; arcade and do the stuff there to help you catch up with whatever you missed out on:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://app.codesignal.com/arcade">https://app.codesignal.com/arcade</a>
 AntiSquid: i can do that stuff without degree .
 NotNick.: sweet nice one.
 NotNick.: they do but the tasks that we had to complete didn't involve using or  creating any really. 
 HelloWorld183L: what data structures would they have involved then?
 NotNick.: We always got a sample code , never started from 0 really
 HelloWorld183L: lool
 NotNick.: which i believe it was a huge mistake.
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's a common complaint I've heard a lot
 AntiSquid: what uni did you study at&#160;? 
 NotNick.: Coventry university
 MSmits: it's good to start with sample code when you dont know much yet, but at some point you need to start from scratch
 eulerscheZahl: i like the default code
 MSmits: in CG i do yeah
 MSmits: I meant in general for teaching coding
 eulerscheZahl: except if someone didn't read the manual how to write stubs
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. reading a line as a string instead of list of integers
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: input/output stuff is a special part of coding for sure and so is string manipulation. 
 MSmits: for writing bots and such, the focus should not be on that
 MSmits: so the default code is great to skip this
 eulerscheZahl: Console.ReadLine().Split().Select(int.Parse).ToArray()done
 AntiSquid: you could argue the simulation part should be imported from a library outside your IDE because it's boilerplate code
 eulerscheZahl: nah, i want full control
 MSmits: mmh not that easy to answer, because for some games, coming up with the fastest simulation is a big part
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC gives you a huge starter code with all classes defined already
 MSmits: you could also have boilerplate minimax and mcts ready to go. Or just give the whole bot except the eval
 MSmits: or give even the eval and set all parameters to 0 so they just have to fit them
 AntiSquid: same as with writing your own machine learning models, but libraries for that are very popular
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MailRuChamps/raic-2019/tree/master/clients">https://github.com/MailRuChamps/raic-2019/tree/master/clients</a>last contest. open any folder and just have a look at how many classes it has
 AntiSquid: oh and i guess that could include some granularity on parts of the simulations you want to import
 eulerscheZahl: you get the full gamestate using their class model
 AntiSquid: ya i used their stuff
 AntiSquid: but their code is confusing
 eulerscheZahl: and then you create your own classes and map to them as you don't like the initial setup
 AntiSquid: why is the same library #included multiple times on the same file
 eulerscheZahl: the nullables annoyed me in the C# starter
 eulerscheZahl: just define a NONE weapon type instead of using a Weapon?
 AntiSquid: lots of nonsense in their code . 
 <b>**eulerscheZahl almost never uses nullable</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: same here euler
 eulerscheZahl: asked illedan, he doesn't either
 Illedan: Only when creating APIs for others.
 MSmits: well I use almost nothing :P
 eulerscheZahl: generics?
 AntiSquid: oh i remember that, had to check everytime if weapon&#160;!= nullpointer
 MSmits: whats a generic again?
 eulerscheZahl: List&lt;T&gt;
 MSmits: I use Lists
 MSmits: not List&lt;T&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: WHAT??
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 Illedan:&#160;?!
 MSmits: never used that sry&#160;:)
 AntiSquid:&#160;????
 Illedan: hahaha
 HelloWorld183L: i use php variable variables
 MSmits: seriously I code in C# almost like i do C++
 eulerscheZahl: you surprised Illedan as well. see what you've done
 eulerscheZahl: c++ has a vector&lt;T&gt; too
 MSmits: C# to me is like C++ without being able to do suicidal lines of code
 AntiSquid: i added question marks too for extra dramatic effect
 MSmits: oh and i like the string stuff
 HelloWorld183L: what universities have you guys gone to
 MSmits: in C#
 AntiSquid: multiple ones HelloWorld183L
 HelloWorld183L: ok
 MSmits: university of Amsterdam
 eulerscheZahl: a German one that you've probably never heard of
 MSmits: and university of codingame
 eulerscheZahl: Friedrich Alexander Universität Erlangen
 AntiSquid: i mean i cooked at multiple universities HelloWorld183L
 MSmits: that's the swastika place right euler?
 eulerscheZahl: the one where the Erlang language is from
 HelloWorld183L: yes take the question literally
 eulerscheZahl: no, that was my high school ("Gymnasium")
 MSmits: the one where it's on the floor?
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: fun times
 MSmits: yup. HelloWorld183L thinks you went through high school in WWII now
 eulerscheZahl: :old_man:
 eulerscheZahl: :older_man:
 HelloWorld183L: then got tutored under alan turing 
 AntiSquid: timetraveling with a haunebu

 eulerscheZahl: next one will take place in 3 weeks
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, contests, they're always fun
 AntiSquid: seriously, CG is about the multiplayer and the visuals, because otherwise you can just use any of the 100++ coding puzzle sites out there
 pefbrute: Mmm, thanks, AntiSquid
 pefbrute: I start to get the picture
 eulerscheZahl: for the multiplayers there's only a handful of similar websites but with less content and less frequent contests
 eulerscheZahl: such as Russian AI Cup
 Dartisan: That part comes later, to optimise and climb the ranks&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: But ofc there are many who just do puzzles too.
 eulerscheZahl: or even clashes
 Astrobytes: yup
 eulerscheZahl: poor misguided souls
 AntiSquid: 73/247 in d&amp;b . i know i didn't put in a lot of effort but when rank &gt; 50% i expect to get more than 350 / 2700 CP
 AntiSquid: 2450 *
 Astrobytes: Community multis are about prestige not points :P
 AntiSquid: now i need to sort by area size what to take in late game
 AntiSquid: ya feeling proud every time i beat something like a heavy sim or bitboard magic with a low effort algo
 AntiSquid: i go read something, don't want to overexert now
 Astrobytes: I like Penguins better, I'll work on that before D&amp;B
 AntiSquid: i know the d&amp;b game from memory, that's all the reason i am doing it
 jacek: linuxes eh
 AntiSquid: i can't think of any gameboard structure i like
 jacek: unary board
 Dartisan: I am curious if the Fall Challenge 2020 will be a State Machine problem.
 AntiSquid: i think it's a gardening problem
 AntiSquid: witches collect herbs 
 Astrobytes: could be herbs vs witches
 eulerscheZahl: my money is on some grid map.
 Astrobytes: lol
 Dartisan: so more Pathfinder&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: but can you control more than 1 witch?
 AntiSquid: i am 100% it's a grid map contest
 Astrobytes: oh, witches in a labyrinth with FOW
 Astrobytes: Blind witches
 AntiSquid: no maze no
 eulerscheZahl: but with a magic spell to see through the fog
 eulerscheZahl: lumus
 AntiSquid: i expect some timers on items or something like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Maybe I can be a grandmaster, i freakin' gurus
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u
 Dartisan: Sounds nearly a bit like HyperSonic where I currently in.
 AntiSquid: maze games will sound similar but they're not
 eulerscheZahl: exploding vessels?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a combo of code vs zombies and fantastic bits, lol
 Astrobytes: I highly doubt it would be another physics-based game
 AntiSquid: i mean grid games, not maze
 Einwickler: Please no physics game :pray:
 Scarfield: its obviously a potions game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, and I'm rewriting codevzomb
 Astrobytes: Potionfield
 AntiSquid: is codevszomb physics game? :P
 AntiSquid: what does it count as
 Scarfield: witchstroBytes
 Astrobytes: oh christ, I hope it's not like CalM, with potion recipes
 Dartisan: say, it is more the components finding and timer, I am just calculating.
 eulerscheZahl: Scarfog
 Scarfield: i was too late to approve your mine sweeper frogfog&#160;:'(
 AntiSquid: i expect it to be like calm only in the sense that you plant seeds and then collect them after a timer Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, well cvz doesn't have tiles/cells , but it does have circle intersection maths
 Illedan: Damn, Minesweeper was harder than I thought :O
 eulerscheZahl: :imp:
 Astrobytes: Hm, could be interesting like that AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: Can minesweeper be made into an optim or not worth it?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: Just luck
 Illedan: After a certain point
 Einwickler: AntisSquid like a facebok game? :joy:
 AntiSquid: i never played minsweeper seriously, there were always an awful lot of nice windows games to play back then instead of the default win95-98 games
 Astrobytes: Hm, yeah I guess 
 Scarfield: next up will be pinball
 Astrobytes: I spent many lessons at school playing minesweeper :P
 eulerscheZahl: not blockout?
 AntiSquid: ugh physics ugh someone complain :P
 Illedan: Pinball would be fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: another code a la mode would kill me
 Illedan: crazy physics :D 
 AntiSquid: what is CvZ classed as&#160;?
 Scarfield: optim
 AntiSquid: is BotG physics&#160;?
 Astrobytes: annoying
 AntiSquid: next wolf 3D or DOOM euler :P the image files are ripped 
 Dartisan: I prefer code4life over code à la mode&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: wolf 3D was great
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan likes physics
 Illedan: Sure
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Wiki/index.php?title=File:Wolfenstein_3D_-_DOS_-_Graphics_-_Bosses.png">http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Wiki/index.php?title=File:Wolfenstein_3D_-_DOS_-_Graphics_-_Bosses.png</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: *cough* bitrunner
 Einwickler: Maybe he just likes the pain&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: nice AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: I don't know why everyone hates the physics so much, just implement the engine and get on with it
 Illedan: I think Minesweeper classifies as hard euler :thinking:
 AntiSquid: i don't read referees astro :P
 AntiSquid: usually .
 Astrobytes: meh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: What game would sum up 2020?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII snickers</b></p><p><img src="/a/22238461634817" /> Scarfield: the worst sim imho i have made so far was Chutulu
 AntiSquid: not pandemic PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: The Mexican Lovecraft one Spellfield?
 Scarfield: you know which one :p
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AntiSquid: some goofy chaotic clown game would be more suitable for 2020
 eulerscheZahl: you are wrong Illedan. when it's in hard, less players will see it :D
 Illedan: xD
 Scarfield: fake news detector
 Illedan: Going for them users
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The CDC admitted it has no samples of CoV-19 ... how do you make a vaccine?  W/ samples of the virus ... something smells funny
 Illedan: I'm too tierd today to see the clear solution in the endgame
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/v40szt">https://prnt.sc/v40szt</a>
 eulerscheZahl: do you find those mines?
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: This is where I am now
 Illedan: And wondering how to implement it with my mess :D 
 eulerscheZahl: does human Illedan find them?
 Illedan: sure
 AntiSquid: PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;! Death Stranding is the game that leaves you just as confused and annoyed as 2020&#160;! No doubt there. Good graphics, but hate being a delivery boy (didn't buy it based on that)
 Illedan: I tried to make this code small and stupid. Should have gone full on from the start :P Feel like I need a search to solve this
 Scarfield: i only did certain bombs -&gt; certain safe cells -&gt; probability of bomb on remaining edge tiles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my daughter wants to dress up as an AmongUS character for halloween ... I'm like wtf, u want me to make you look like a hazmat person
 eulerscheZahl: i opted for ugly code
 Scarfield: wouldnt find the bombs on the pic euler linked, but the probability part would pass still
 AntiSquid: i like the meme: "for Halloween this year i am going to dress as myself without a mask, people find it scary enough"
 Einwickler: AntiSquid Empty supermarket shelves
 Scarfield: with toilet paper prices
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid I don't have a ps4, i like norman reedus...hmmm
 AntiSquid: Einwickler a plain card board tube (from the toilet paper roll) 
 Einwickler: AntiSquid thats way better yeah! :D
 AntiSquid: i was using kitchen wipes for 1-2 weeks btw .
 Romil: I think Clash of Code problems should be harder.  (much harder..)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I ordered a wire face light up mask.  Last year my daughter was a devil woman...they gonna love us at the church around the corner again this year!
 Scarfield: try out some puzzles Romil
 Romil: Ummm... sorry but.. can you tell me 'where' are puzzles in this website&#160;??  :sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: 15 minutes romil
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 Scarfield: then you can choose the difficulty you want&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall ran out of TP in the UK?
 Romil: Thank You Very Much  !!  :)
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a> Romil, this is only solved by 4 people on the site
 AntiSquid: much harder .
 Scarfield: np, also check out the compete sections. The Bot programming is by far what i enjoy the most on this site Romil&#160;:)
 Romil: No No.. I am just a kid.  :sweat_smile::sweat_smile::sweat_smile::sweat_smile:
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII grumbles fkin' Euler</b></p><p><img src="/a/50711405528093" /> Einwickler: AntiSquid Ouch. I just used 1 sheet peer session :D
 eulerscheZahl: at least I was kind enough to put Space Maze into expert (was going for "hard" at first)
 Romil: talking about that 'much' harder part..  :sweat_smile:
 Scarfield: didnt know you and euler were that close patrickMc
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: a bit too friendly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he can Funge himself thankyou
 Astrobytes: ffs hahaha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least euler keeps making content despite trying his best to melt brains
 Astrobytes: when my nephew was really small he used to call fire engines "funge-ins"
 ZarthaxX: sounds like :mushroom:
 Scarfield: Zarthoo
 Astrobytes: Ah Mr Mushroom, he was a fungi to be with
 Astrobytes: hello SporethaxX
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't know a tesla could do 235kph
 Samnath_shah: wow
 ZarthaxX: SporeaxX sounded cool Astrobytocus
 ZarthaxX: Scarfoooooooooooooooooooo
 ZarthaxX: hai
 Scarfield: :vulcan:
 ZarthaxX: waddup
 Scarfield: finished the boys in a week, and waiting for the contest&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: what is that?
 Einwickler: The boys is really worth it
 Scarfield: amazon prime show about super heroes
 Einwickler: Im pretty anti super hero movies but this series was really good
 eulerscheZahl: hi ZarthaxX. how's it going with the SDK?
 ZarthaxX: have been busy, couldnt continue
 ZarthaxX: and also found out im a noob with gmail
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: what's hard about gmail?
 ZarthaxX: i found out that i missed 2 mails from a company
 eulerscheZahl: important ones?
 ZarthaxX: yeah, but i got the third one today, asking me if i was seeing the mails
 ZarthaxX: and that's how i realized i missed the other ones :P
 ZarthaxX: i had 2 interviews with it until now, and now im goingto have a third one
 ZarthaxX: im glad they insisted sending 3 mails to contact me..
 eulerscheZahl: ghosting a company that wants to hire you, smart move
 Astrobytes: lol, what's the job?
 ZarthaxX: the other 2 mails were sent to promotions 
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: honestly i dont know astro lol, i just started talking with them after winning a contest from them
 eulerscheZahl: do you use an external client for your emails?
 ZarthaxX: it's a company relate dto security
 Astrobytes: Oh, interesting
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl no
 Astrobytes: You did a CTF or something?
 ZarthaxX: the possible job would be a security research, but im just starting lol
 ZarthaxX: but they "believe" i have pontential
 ZarthaxX: yes, it was a pre ctf
 ZarthaxX: it was cool
 Astrobytes: nice
 ZarthaxX: challenges are still out there i think
 eulerscheZahl: give link
 ZarthaxX: you had to find flags in 6 different games
 ZarthaxX: 2 made in c, 2 in python and 2 in java
 Scarfield: sounds nice, polar bears are rare these days, of course they want you
 eulerscheZahl: the C ones are probably the hardest

 PatrickMcGinnisII: entonces
 ZarthaxX: the first password is this one We1come_To_0napsis_Ch4llenges
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl i would say the java ones are the hardest :P
 ZarthaxX: there is a minesweeper
 eulerscheZahl: python2, how ancient
 ZarthaxX: yes, annoying
 eulerscheZahl: there are 2 minesweepers now
 eulerscheZahl: or do you mean in the CTF?

 eulerscheZahl: guided me through mini RAIC
 ZarthaxX: i tried RAIC :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: still cant stand the translation
 AntiSquid: when is raic this year
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX is doing CTFs? :o
 eulerscheZahl: tbd
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid starting to look into security :P
 ZarthaxX: well, dive into
 jacek: yay for bayern
 eulerscheZahl: btw RAIC will not have any tshirts / hoodies this time&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 ZarthaxX: i never tried it but well
 eulerscheZahl: but if you go for the overly complex game, there's still hope
 ZarthaxX: it always discourages me
 Astrobytes: same, I take a look at the engine, and the hundred page manual and give up
 AntiSquid: it helped me practice pointers and shared pointers (the shitty messy RAIC game engine i mean)
 AntiSquid: because i built on their shitty code
 MSmits: hey jacek... I am still fitting params for your jacekmax
 MSmits: it's slowly getting better, but I don't think it'll be better at the end
 MSmits: probably same rank on leaderboard though
 MSmits: somewhere within that huge gap
 MSmits: at least it proves it can work fine for something other than your NN's
 AntiSquid: which game
 jacek: i thought as much
 jacek: i think with best parameters it wont be different from what you have now
 MSmits: I'm not sure, it might be worse. I suspect your search is more sensitive to a good eval
 MSmits: and your NN obviously has a far better eval
 MSmits: because the EPT way is fuzzier, taking the average
 MSmits: it's like what you do with normal mcts, you dont have a good eval, so you take the average
 MSmits: AntiSquid: Oware
 MSmits: but i will keep the structure of the eval completely identical and also fit the same (slowass) way with cg bench. That's probably the fairest way to do this
 MSmits: so far I get 50+% vs everyone but darkhorse
 MSmits: and the NN's... just testing vs Agade, but he wrecks me
 jacek: do you have some automated parameter tuning?
 MSmits: i dont atm, but i can whip it up I suppose when i have some time
 MSmits: not any thing fancy though, i dont have the temoral difference thingy down yet 
 MSmits: just taking a param, fitting it, using a random move param like you do, then take a different parameter, fitting it again, just visiting each in order
 MSmits: multiple passes until stuck in local optimum
 jacek: you do it all manually? :scream:
 MSmits: always have
 jacek: i thought maybe some GA was involved
 Astrobytes: (the M in MSmits stands for 'masochistic' :P )
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: except when i am wrecking you though, then the S means something else
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: jacek i also never wrote a GA
 MSmits: I have some bad holes in my knowledge
 Astrobytes: Still? I thought you were gonna practice it a few months back
 MSmits: it is still on my list i suppose
 jacek: welp
 MSmits: btw, doesnt have to be GA
 MSmits: can also be SA
 MSmits: just need one of those things
 jacek: or PSO or CLOP or SPSA or whatever
 MSmits: yeah, there's many ways to put 3 or 4 charactes together
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 MSmits: hard to use those in conjunction with CG bench though
 MSmits: so you kinda have to use self-training
 MSmits: I mean it's not impossible, just difficult for me
 MSmits: I have had self training arenas before. All I would have to do is put one of those GA thingies in there
 MSmits: basically, I would take a set of parameters. And another set of parameters, make them have babies and select the best. Maybe mutate the babies a bit. Sounds easy
 jacek: but fitness function is most expensive
 MSmits: why?
 MSmits: isnt it just winrate?
 MSmits: oh, you do changes compared to the last version
 MSmits: the params that changed more are adjusted more
 MSmits: but thats a different type of training
 MSmits: so I am confused
 MSmits: what is this fitness function?
 jacek: how do you compare 2 organisms? which one is better
 MSmits: the one that wins more
 Astrobytes: fitness function is your eval
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: so dont you have all sets play a bunch of games?
 Astrobytes: you select offspring according to their fitness
 jacek: fitness function is way do determine which bot is better. but to do that you need to play handful of games
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: for each pair
 MSmits: ohhh wait
 MSmits: you mean the playing of games is part of the fitness function
 MSmits: i thought of that as being separate
 MSmits: ofc playing games is expensive
 jacek: ah
 MSmits: there is a lot of experimentation to be done with is
 MSmits: so many free paramters in GA
 MSmits: SA is way easier like that
 Astrobytes: tuning SA ain't always easy
 jacek: ah, the hyper parameters :unamused:
 MSmits: maybe not easier, but less parameters makes it faster
 MSmits: i would guess GA often outperforms SA, just because there are more dials
 MSmits: btw if you know a good animation about GA or even SA where you can adjust dials to get different fitting results, let me know
 MSmits: i dont mean a video
 MSmits: some iteractive thing. I've seen people in videos do them
 MSmits: interactive
 Astrobytes: there's an interactive Mars Lander one somewhere iirc
 jacek: i dont know any
 Astrobytes: Or something along those lines
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: I'll look for that more specifically
 MSmits: things like that really beef up a course
 jacek: yes there are some articles on cg for ga
 MSmits: I can tell the students what to try and think about the results
 MSmits: yeah i knew that
 MSmits: I am also thinking of letting them fit a NN for a simple "AND" or "OR"   operator
 MSmits: and calculate the output by hand
 MSmits: maybe something animated so you can see the NN being trained to give the right result
 MSmits: and of course the google website about tensorflow
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/</a>
 Scarfield: go to the testing paragraph there is a animation which explains the process pretty well
 Scarfield: if you are still here MSmits
 yankydoodle: hey, im just trying to do that with mars lander. still stuck at trying to simulate it. does anyone know i should round any of the numbers? because currently i am getting different positions compared to the site
 Scarfield: its a bit weird, it keeps the decimal points until you crash/land/fly out, but then it shows rounded values iirc
 Scarfield: so you should not round, its only the values shown that are rounded
 yankydoodle: ok,  now so now i must find what is actually wrong with it :P
 yankydoodle: thanks
 Scarfield: np, how are you calculating the change of position?
 yankydoodle: i break it down to x speed and y speed, x acceleration and y acceleration, and each turn the speed changes according to the acceleration, and the position changes based on speed
 yankydoodle: i only tried testing it on freefall for now
 Scarfield: mars lander is the only puzzle where you have to take into consideration that the acceleration is not instant
 yankydoodle: oh
 Scarfield: so: dy = y0 + v0 t + 0.5 a t^2
 yankydoodle: oh i calculated as acceleration being the change in speed (m/s) per second
 yankydoodle: probably should look at the formulas again
 yankydoodle: so for what you wrote its relevant when acceleration is the same, so i use it to calculate only for one turn, so the t is 1, so its 
 yankydoodle: if i understand correctly
 Scarfield: yup&#160;:)
 Scarfield: vy just to be clear
 Scarfield: and ay
 yankydoodle: yeah
 yankydoodle: ok so ill seperate acceleration to x axis and y axis, then use the formula for each axis individually
 yankydoodle: thanks :D
 Scarfield: exactly
 Scarfield: np mars lander is a bit weird since all other puzzles just assume the acceleration is added instantly to the velocity
 yankydoodle: ok thats good to know for when i try the other ones
 yankydoodle: yesss! got it working for freefall
 Scarfield: :muslce:
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Scarfield: nice
 yankydoodle: so the order i did it is:
 yankydoodle: calculate accelerationupdate postion (y = y0 + 0.5a)update speed (v = v0 +a)
 yankydoodle: first time i did any kind of simulation, feels nice
 Scarfield: yea good job&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks Scarfield, that's not directly usable as a teaching tool, but I can use it as inspiration 
 MSmits: i mean in my specific circumstances, i can't directly link this for the students and expect them to use it, but it's very detailed and will help me understand and transform it into something better
 Scarfield: oh missed that you wanted to use it for teaching, but yea it explains the idea very well&#160;:)
 MSmits: it sure does
 MSmits: for me the extra detail is good, because I already read a lot of general stuff about GA
 MSmits: this gif is great
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ezgif.com-optimize-4.gif">https://www.codingame.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ezgif.com-optimize-4.gif</a>
 MSmits: I might actually use this in my teaching material
 Scarfield: yea its great, are you going to teach NN's GA or both?
 MSmits: it's an AI course
 MSmits: I start with BFS/DFS and such
 MSmits: then GA/SA
 MSmits: maybe i'll do pagerank
 MSmits: for sure machine learning in several forms
 Scarfield: cool&#160;:)
 MSmits: and I will definitely link to the social dilemma and do something with that
 MSmits: it will mostly be code-free, with coding exercises being extra for smarter students
 MSmits: but they need to completely understand the algorithms
 MSmits: so they need to be able to explain when BFS works better or DFS
 MSmits: and which one finds the shortest path
 MSmits: etc.
 MSmits: thats why i am looking at a lot of interactive examples
 MSmits: coding it yourself works, but is way too time consuming
 MSmits: for the student I mean
 Scarfield: yea makes sense, and you cant really code it if you dont understand it to begin with
 MSmits: maybe I'll let them all work out a section of their choice and grade that
 MSmits: so, a pathfinding coding exercise or a ga or whatever
 MSmits: maybe I'll involve CG some way, not sure
 Scarfield: do you have animations for BFS and A*?
 MSmits: yes
 Scarfield: ok, just remembered seing some good ones, but not where. but wont look if you already have them&#160;:)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/">https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/</a>
 MSmits: this is amazing
 MSmits: if you know more, sure do share
 MSmits: the more I have the better
 MSmits: i already put this in an iframe in my course
 Scarfield: damn, thats i nice link. sure ill see if i can find it
 MSmits: at first i wondered why DFS is not in that link i shared
 MSmits: but i guess it's a horrible algorithm for such an open space
 MSmits: even though you could draw a very closed mazelike thing
 MSmits: so anything that compares DFS and BFS in a similar way would be perfect
 Scarfield: you know redblobgames.com right?

 MSmits: it even has python
 MSmits: which is the language we use
 MSmits: wow that is amazing
 MSmits: I should translate this whole thing and then refer to the redblobgames site for the english version. Then they get credit
 Scarfield: yea its a great site, there is also stuff about hex tiles :p

 MSmits: except very different subject 
 MSmits: but equally amazing
 MSmits: that one is all about learning to code 3D stuff, noise, shaders and randomly generating things
 Scarfield: oh yea, forgot about this one, but can see i have it favorited
 Scarfield: have considered to look into noise, the stuff you can make with it is amazing
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I did a lot of experimentation on random world generation at some point
 MSmits: with voxel engines and such
 MSmits:  I even learned how to do it on the GPU for speed
 MSmits: it's one of those rabbit holes i fell into
 Scarfield: xD

 MSmits: nope

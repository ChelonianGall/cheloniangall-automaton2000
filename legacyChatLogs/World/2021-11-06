 experiencednoob: i need help im not that good at coding and im stuck on angle and distance
 baneetparmar: hello world
 Sp4m: Hi!
 baneetparmar: nice to meet you sir
 Sp4m: Nice to meet you too./
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Sahxom: Once one of those 15 minutes clash are completed and the result is done, is there any way to go back and check the instructions and score of a older clash you participated in?
 jacek: in notifications you can go back to check the score
 jacek: but for instructions you need to use other searcher <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Sahxom: thanks
 MSmits: mmh it asked me to click on boats when i logged in just now
 MSmits: did I do anything to make you guys think I am a robot?
 MSmits: Seems like the boats got automaton as well, he's off
 Jerrasterix: Maybe went for a break, to celebrate Caturday 
 MSmits: this is possible
 JHBonarius: bwuh. keep running out of memory on CTTT
 MSmits: you do know the game is a bit broken currently i hope
 JHBonarius: MCST is just too big... 5'000'000 nodes and mem's full
 JHBonarius: yes draw
 MSmits: I spent a little time on it, but no more until they fix it
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: 5 million nodes isnt much
 MSmits: I can fit 25 million
 JHBonarius: my node is too big
 JHBonarius: (that's what she said)
 MSmits: what do you put on there?
 MSmits: don't put the whole board on there
 JHBonarius: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16446663-37e1-454e-9643-62121499eaef">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16446663-37e1-454e-9643-62121499eaef</a>
 JHBonarius: uhm
 JHBonarius: again
 JHBonarius: -parent Node*
 JHBonarius: - 2x float UCT
 MSmits: uct?
 MSmits: why store that?
 MSmits: also never store a vector of node pointers
 JHBonarius: precalcuate
 JHBonarius: worked fine in UTTT
 MSmits: but not to win
 MSmits: it's slow
 MSmits: why not have a giant node array out of which you take a set of children
 MSmits: you just need to point to the first child then
 MSmits: and include the number of children
 MSmits: so firstchild + childcount
 MSmits: thats better than having up to 100 children, like you would have in CTTT
 MSmits: 100 * 64 bit or 1 * 64 bit...
 JHBonarius: yeah, could look into that
 MSmits: also with the vector you are dynamically allocating memory
 MSmits: during the game
 MSmits: because the vector memory is not reserved
 JHBonarius: yeah, in CTTT I didn't do that, but these vectors are just SOO large
 JHBonarius: CTTT has much more moves then UTTT
 MSmits: yes it does
 MSmits: but all that means is that you probably wont reuse the tree
 JHBonarius: I will rethink
 MSmits: reusing the tree is completely pointless anyway
 MSmits: with so much branching
 JHBonarius: hmm, so you keep recalculation the whole tree?
 MSmits: no i mean between turns
 MSmits: you dont use the tree from the last turn
 JHBonarius: yeah, that's what I meant
 JHBonarius: I could try that
 MSmits: btw, i havent written a mcts for this game, but i did for clobber, same situation
 JHBonarius: clobber? other bot game?
 MSmits: yeah, also a crazy amount of possible moves
 MSmits: btw, on the node, you could store the move + the score added
 JHBonarius: I just got back, so I just started something I could partially recoignize for long ago
 MSmits: so the index of the square
 MSmits: and the amount of score the move added
 MSmits: that way you can easily rebuild the board during selection with hardly any calculation
 JHBonarius: oh, yeah, I store that too. missed that
 MSmits: so dont store the whole board
 JHBonarius: And also if it's expanded or not
 JHBonarius: no, board is not stored.
 MSmits: i can tell if a node is expanded by the fact that the index of the first child it points to is 0 or not
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24588302-8e50-4716-b150-7daf3be2560c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/24588302-8e50-4716-b150-7daf3be2560c</a>
 JHBonarius: yeah, in the mean time I could. before I was doing stupid things as storing the whole node in the vector, std::moving the best Node as new root....
 MSmits: this is generally what my node looks like
 MSmits: (this one is for C4)
 JHBonarius: that was dumb, as it would break and invalidate all patent poiniters
 MSmits: everything becomes simpler when you switch to an object pool
 MSmits: Node nodes[NODE_MAX];
 JHBonarius: _i can tell if a node is expanded by the fact that the index of the first child it points to is 0 or not_just have to check that you're not at a terminal node
 MSmits: it will still be 0
 JHBonarius: YEah, I have an object pool for UTTT
 MSmits: when i create children i set it to 0
 JHBonarius: but terminal node has no children, so nothing to set to 0
 MSmits: no i mean, for each child
 MSmits: the terminal node is still a child
 MSmits: so it will start with its childindex at 0
 JHBonarius: oh, that
 MSmits: then when i try to expand it i will find out it is terminal
 MSmits: my expansion function always does a pretty deep checking for terminal nodes
 JHBonarius: oh?
 MSmits: sometiomes it's almost like a small depth minimax. The nodes i consider terminal are usually game ended in 1 or 2 turns
 MSmits: 1 or 2 plies
 JHBonarius: smitsimax :P
 JHBonarius: that's long ago
 MSmits: so for C4, I consider nodes terminal if there is no possible move that does not give the opponent a win next turn
 MSmits: so the nodes arent officially terminal  but they are in my tree
 MSmits: ah yeah i havent done smitsimax for a long time, it doesnt work for boardgames really
 JHBonarius: Me remembers..
 MSmits: btw, I have been thinking hard about a way to make use of the fact that CTTT has islands
 MSmits: it feels like you should be able to make use of it to solve the game 30 plies or more before the end
 MSmits: divide and conquer
 MSmits: but I get stuck on this
 MSmits: I only solve 13 plies now
 MSmits: which gets me rank 4 with the mirror trick
 MSmits: but with 30 plies, i'd even beat the tric
 jacek: with 100 plies, youll be unbeatable
 MSmits: indeed\
 JHBonarius: plies?
 MSmits: moves
 MSmits: turn = both players move
 MSmits: ply = 1 player moves
 JHBonarius: p-lies?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: ply singular
 JHBonarius: pl-ies?
 jacek: pries
 MSmits: just plies
 JHBonarius: police?:cop: 
 JHBonarius: sorry, I think I need a break
 MSmits: thats ok, think of my island problem and come back with a solution so i can take the nr 1 before i quit :P
 JHBonarius: quit?
 MSmits: move on to different multi
 MSmits: already did more or less
 MSmits: but the island thing stuck in my head
 MSmits: i hate thinking about a problem and then not solving it
 jacek: world hunger
 MSmits: yeah thats why i dont think about that
 gcp: hi there
 Jerrasterix: hi gcp
 jacek: good morning
 gcp: hi jerrasterix! good day to you!&#160;:)
 Bonis: start the clash bro
 MSmits: bruh
 Jerrasterix: jacek, its evening in India :confused:
 MSmits: jacek is a flat earther so...
 MSmits: everywhere morning at the same time&#160;:)
 Jerrasterix: :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: hey, respect his beliefs :P
 MSmits: don't try to argue it, you'll bring the skydome crashing down on him
 Jerrasterix: at least, he have to consider that time zones exist :shrug:
 MSmits: they don't. It's a conspiracy
 MSmits: if you think so, you're in on it
 Jerrasterix: Then why's out American brothers still snoring on bed&#160;???
 MSmits: lazy
 Jerrasterix: :joy:
 Jerrasterix: maybe you are right&#160;!!
 MSmits: hey it's not me thinking this
 MSmits: the earth is obviously a cube
 MSmits: which explains timezones
 Jerrasterix: Flat, sphere, next cube...
 MSmits: and the inspiration that created dice
 Jerrasterix: Thanks god no one have gone for donut 
 MSmits: Donut Earthers are mental. I agree
 MSmits: You'd see parts of the earth in the sky
 MSmits: flat earther community should have been a wake up call imho. It's older than Qanon. 
 MSmits: flat earther does little harm, but if people will believe that, then...
 Jerrasterix: atleast the famous greek, who predicted mostly wrong, was right about Earth being a sphere 
 MSmits: well that's not really a point in favor of the spherical earth camp :P
 TheBattleGiant_2959: mostly wrong ,what??
 Jerrasterix: yeah, Aristotle 
 Jerrasterix: So you are a cube earther MSmits&#160;??
 MSmits: no lol
 MSmits: I teach physics. That would have been an interesting belief to hold while teaching astrophysics
 sillix: bobo earther
 Jerrasterix: Ohh... you teach physics&#160;?? uni prof&#160;??
 MSmits: nah high school on average 16-17 yr olds, highest level
 MSmits: but this year i mostly teach computer science
 MSmits: just got my degree for that
 Jerrasterix: Nice&#160;!! congrats 
 MSmits: thanks!
 MSmits: oh and just to be clear, afaik jacek is not a flat-earther :P
 Jerrasterix:&#160;:+1:

 LittleVandalSD: wy
 Bonis: strat the clash bro
 jacek: hm
 AntiSquid: MSmits how come you didn't go for astrophysics&#160;? can't say uninteresting can you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: "can't say IT'S uninteresting"  ate up a whole word in there 
 MSmits: astrophysics is just a part of physics in high school
 MSmits: I studied astrophysics as the university, but it is for 70% the same thing as different areas of physics
 MSmits: like theoretical physics or experimental physics
 MSmits: only the last part (master) is different
 MSmits: I did a master in astrophysics and science teaching
 jacek: so you can build rockets now
 Cure: peter
 Alonius: Can someone please provide us a clue about sherloc holmes last problem?
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 YCSVenom: ATLA
 MSmits: jacek i can't build anything unless it's legos :P
 dtnguyen123: lol
 dtnguyen123:&#160;????
 dtnguyen123: :mouth:
 dtnguyen123: :mouth:
 jacek: no school today :thinking:
 andrew911: heyy
 AntiSquid: got a masters? you could be a host for a fun series like Neil de Grass
 AntiSquid: ya i was referring to pursuing something outside of highschool
 AntiSquid: is this chat always this dead&#160;? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: is there a way to find out
 MSmits: AntiSquid the reason i didnt go further into astrophysics is that I am a weird person that doesn't want to travel the world
 MSmits: I could maybe have done a PHD here, but other than that I would have to go abroad
 MSmits: Dutch astrophysics is at such a high level that you're not good enough to stay. They get the best from all over the world. 
 MSmits: besides that, I should have gone into computer science from the start. It turns out that that is much more my thing
 AntiSquid: makes sense
 AntiSquid: sorry for the weird questioning, just had this random youtube recommendation earlier and it reminded me smits had written his paper <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW_qIqLhPkI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW_qIqLhPkI</a>
 MSmits: It's not that I wasn't good enough (or  I think i wasn't). It's just that you're not good enough right after you finish PHD. So you have to get better elsewhere
 MSmits: and it's considered good to have been places...
 MSmits: nice video btw
 MSmits: it's fun to see how when they visit eachothers lectures it's like being a student again
 The_King_of_Demons: Hi! I signed in CodinGame like half an hour ago!!
 MSmits: welcome!
 The_King_of_Demons: I was searching through the web to find some unblocked games then I'm here!!
 The_King_of_Demons: Do you think Among Us 2 will be released??
 jacek: oh my
 The_King_of_Demons: Hmmm??
 jacek: half an hour and already lvl 3? :thinking:
 jacek: pretty sus
 The_King_of_Demons: Well, I sometimes manage to get things done quicker than expected lol. 
 The_King_of_Demons: So, follow for follow somebody??
 The_King_of_Demons: Anybody??
 The_King_of_Demons: It's like you following somebody so they follow you!!
 MSmits: I don't follow
 MSmits: I mean, I don't understand what you mean
 Scarfield: badum tss
 The_King_of_Demons:&#160;??
 MSmits: :question:

 MSmits: or that
 monseur: hmm
 The_King_of_Demons: Oh 😕
 The_King_of_Demons: @MSmits
 MSmits: it is I
 MSmits: btw, the @ does nothin
 The_King_of_Demons: I dunno what's going on now.
 MSmits: The_King_of_Demons
 MSmits: what color is it
 MSmits: I did it without @
 The_King_of_Demons:&#160;??????????????????????????????????
 MSmits: this chat is more advanced than discord. We upgraded from @'s
 The_King_of_Demons: Oh
 The_King_of_Demons: Of course.
 MSmits: you can use tab button to finish a name
 MSmits: that's if you have one
 MSmits: so i type The_ and then tab
 MSmits: and poof there's you're name
 MSmits: your
 The_King_of_Demons: The_King_of_Demons
 MSmits: thats your name
 MSmits: I'm glad we are having this intellectual discussion
 The_King_of_Demons: Ok I get it now.
 MSmits: let me know if there is any more confusion
 The_King_of_Demons: K!
 MSmits: Btw, you only need one "?". But you can use the big one
 MSmits: :grey_question:
 The_King_of_Demons: Well my mom made pizza rolls brb.
 Wontonimo: :question:
 The_King_of_Demons: I'm a 4th grade 9 year old boy lol
 MSmits: that's ok
 Wontonimo: no need to give such exact details
 The_King_of_Demons: sry lol
 MSmits: my dog is 6 yrs old
 Wontonimo: you are starting to code at around the same time I did
 Wontonimo: congrats!
 The_King_of_Demons: Oh
 Scarfield: I can ride my bike with no handlebars
 The_King_of_Demons: cool
 MSmits: you mean you're not touching the steering thingy or does it not have rubbers?
 Wontonimo: as far as I got at that age was print statements, if statements, variables (no arrays), and goto statements (worse than functions)
 Wontonimo: but I made some really fun text adventure games that I was (and still am) proud of
 Scarfield: its from a song smitsi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLUX0y4EptA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLUX0y4EptA</a>
 MSmits: o
 Wontonimo: what programming language are you focusing on The_King_of_Demons&#160;?
 The_King_of_Demons: Go
 The_King_of_Demons: That's the language
 MSmits: we also have the game Go 
 The_King_of_Demons: K!]
 The_King_of_Demons:&#160;:))))))
 Wontonimo: I'm not familiar with Go, so I can't give you much help or resources.
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: well not language specific stuff
 MSmits: computational thinking is not tied to any specific language though]
 The_King_of_Demons: after that maybe JavaScript
 MSmits: why javascript?
 Wontonimo: I can give you some inspiration projects.  Here is one that I helped another person here around your age.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/elZDDbt">https://tech.io/snippet/elZDDbt</a>
 The_King_of_Demons: I dunno.
 MSmits: are you looking to do code for websites?
 The_King_of_Demons: Nah not really
 Wontonimo: He wrote up the game, but instead of instant input it you had to press enter
 Wontonimo: I helped him add the instant input
 Wontonimo: I just played it and got to turn 43
 The_King_of_Demons: I'll play
 MSmits: your racing game made me realize why I never got a drivers license
 MSmits: I can get to turn 1 :P
 The_King_of_Demons: Oh sad
 Wontonimo: here is another example of something close to what I would have written when I was 9 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/lWpWe8m">https://tech.io/snippet/lWpWe8m</a>
 The_King_of_Demons: Oh cool
 The_King_of_Demons: Imma do Clash of Code
 Wontonimo: gotta go.  Good luck The_King_of_Demons&#160;!  Keep it simple for now.  Enjoy doing stuff with text.
 The_King_of_Demons: K!
 MSmits: yep, also if the timelimit is too much for you, it's better to do normal puzzles
 MSmits: clashes are stressful
 The_King_of_Demons: ya ikr I am waiting for it to start
 MSmits: I did not mean the waiting, i meant the fact that you only get 15 mins to find a solution&#160;:)
 The_King_of_Demons: I got so stressed I accidently closed the tab 😭
 MSmits: ahh dont worry about it, either you can go back in, or you're out and can do something else
 MSmits: puzzles are better

 BlaiseVonEbuthIII: Bot contests are better
 The_King_of_Demons: I'll work on coding AI (Artificial Intelligence)
 MSmits: works too, harder than easy puzzles though
 MSmits: (mostly)
 The_King_of_Demons: Ya
 The_King_of_Demons: I'm done
 The_King_of_Demons: Wait, it didn't take that long.
 The_King_of_Demons: Not as long as I thought.
 Roya_hdr: Hi, how can I see my previews clash on games?
 Roya_hdr: is it possible?
 LailaJamad: Hi, where can I find examples of technical tests&#160;?
 The_King_of_Demons: What do you mean??
 The_King_of_Demons: of technical tests?
 LailaJamad: I mean tests used in hiring process
 The_King_of_Demons: I don't know then.
 The_King_of_Demons: Sorry.
 LailaJamad: Thanks anyway for answering 
 The_King_of_Demons:  :smiley_cat:
 The_King_of_Demons: I love cats btw

 The_King_of_Demons: :smile:
 Shrimpster: Yo! In MCTSsolver do you keep the winning positions in a list and compare every position to the list? Seems pretty unefficient, but maybe its better than not doing that&#160;:/
 Shrimpster: With "winning" I mean solved, and with "compare to the list" I mean check if it's in the list
 The_King_of_Demons: I haven't played THAT
 5DN1L: The_King_of_Demons You wanna try? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/monte-carlo-tree-search-exercise</a>
 The_King_of_Demons: Sure
 The_King_of_Demons: I'll play
 moustapha_coding: yow guys&#160;:)
 jacek: Shrimpster huh? in mcts solver you just backpropagate wins/loses more efficiently
 jacek: what do you mean by compare the list
 PluckyPenguin: Anyone know of any more challenges (either on CG or elsewhere) that's like the fall challenge? Really like the adventure style format
 jacek: so, the escape rooms
 PluckyPenguin: yea escape rooms or adventure style
 MACKEYTH: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/games">https://escape.codingame.com/games</a>
 MACKEYTH: Several similar adventures there
 PluckyPenguin: they won't let me start single player
 MACKEYTH: Ah, yeah.&#160;:(
 PluckyPenguin: i guess i could create another account and open it in a diff browser
 PluckyPenguin: but a lot are locked behind a pay wall that looks like you need 2 be a company to take part
 jacek: thats 'cooperation' part
 MACKEYTH: Isn't there somewhere you can post to invite people to pickup CE teams?
 MACKEYTH: Discord or chatroom or somesuch?
 PluckyPenguin: I imagine so I'll search the forums see what I fidn
 PluckyPenguin: is there a quick way to get the code editor to re-evaluate errors? It seems to get stuck and flag errors that dont exist
 MACKEYTH: I've noticed that too.
 PluckyPenguin: Have to refresh the page and sometiems I lose my progress if i dont remember to copy and paste
 MACKEYTH: You can try running a test case to save your code, then refreshing
 PluckyPenguin: ahh sweet thanks&#160;:)
 MACKEYTH: Bonus, the compiler will tell you about any real (syntactic) errors when you do that.
 PluckyPenguin: yea i'm currently ignoring a warning about trying to add 1 to a non-numeric value lol
 jacek: warnings are for losers
 Husoski: Ignoring warnings is for losers.

 SupercraftD: i just learned about the colon for strings in python and my eyes are opened
 Husoski: Slices...yes, they're nice.  That works on lists and tuples too.
 MACKEYTH: Oh, what does it do? Py noob here
 MACKEYTH: Oh, riiight. Py treats strings like char lists, right?
 Husoski: s[::-1] reverses a string.  s[::2] gets every other character.  s[1::2] does, to but skips the first, and much more.
 Husoski: More like tuples than lists, since you can't change chars in a string.
 jacek: oh my
 MACKEYTH: What's the most efficient way to edit strings in Python? I see StringBuilders recommended a lot for Java
 MACKEYTH: As opposed to getting and reconcatenating substrings
 jacek: <i>/join()</i>
 jacek: <i>.join()</i>
 vaeng: the colon for strings? you mean slicing?
 SupercraftD: yeah
 fzfz: strings are immutable though

 Wontonimo: well geoh69, perhaps you are not familiar with community chat rooms.  Be respectful, don't spam, talk about coding or coding game, and (generally) try to stay on topic.

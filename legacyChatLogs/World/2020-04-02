 LakenCodes: what up
 Asterixk: wtf it's 6am now.
 Asterixk: half an hour ago it was like 2am
 landerson6678: <i>.join([])</i>
 Asterixk: o/ US crew is showing up
 LakenCodes: US crew here
 eulerscheZahl: did you switch timezones Asterixk?
 izik1: \o
 Asterixk: lol i did time travel by coffee
 Zandy156: Sometimes I feel like I'd rather understand why my code doesn't work but not be able to fix it than fix it and still not understand why it was broken.
 Blap: that's how life works
 thibpat: Hello :wave: I'm live on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a> to stream Ocean of Code progress! Yesterday we've made it to the Silver league (:
 Asterixk: Does order matter in the commands you send in a turn? Can't find it src..
 izik1: yep
 izik1: Totally does
 Asterixk: aright thx
 izik1: torp where you are at the start of the turn and then move vs move and then torp will do different amounts of self damage
 Asterixk: nice
 Asterixk: so now i have to test the predicted outcome of different orderings... jeez
 eulerscheZahl: also: you can have a cooldown of 1, charge the torpedo while moving and then shoot
 izik1: ^
 izik1: I personally think of every command as a move per command, because that's definitely how it seems to work internally
 izik1: Like, Move, Torp, Surface, all in the same turn
 Asterixk: interesting, And update cooldowns..
 eulerscheZahl: the Like command?
 eulerscheZahl: are you checking facebook with your bot?
 izik1: lolno
 izik1: I'm SoCal
 Asterixk: XD
 izik1: Like, I can hardly say a sentence without the word "like" in it
 izik1: it's fairly difficult unless I'm thinking about it
 AntiSquid: like you could maybe like i don't know, probably try something like avoiding doing it like about all the time?
 eulerscheZahl: jeez, I don't know Rick
 izik1: I mean, like, I could but like, it would be hard and like, I don't really care not to so like, whatever, right?
 izik1: `        return (self.map[self.offset_y as usize] &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 1 == 0;` That's quite the bug (should be &gt;&gt; self.offset_x)
 eulerscheZahl: there is no code formatting in this chat
 izik1: I know&#160;;-;
 eulerscheZahl: oh, kovi is back at the top
 izik1: My tracker now officially handles everything but mines &amp; myself
 eulerscheZahl: mines are relevant for tracking
 izik1: yeah
 izik1: But I mean, I'm preobably _way_ past the point of diminishing returns lol, I still move like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444559992">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444559992</a> 
 kovi: morning euler. we need to wait for a resubmit
 izik1: and I never charge anything but torps
 eulerscheZahl: or you be happy and don't touch it
 kovi: i want to be sure, if its luck or something got better
 Zandy156: do mines relevant for tracking if they are never triggered?
 izik1: I wouldn't think so
 eulerscheZahl: and your movement needs improvement too izik1. but i guess that's on your list already
 Csipcsirip: They could be... you can eliminate states where theres is no space to place mine
 Csipcsirip: but it might be very rare
 eulerscheZahl: too rare to be worth it i think
 kovi: yeah
 izik1: well, if you have time (heuristic bot ftw)
 eulerscheZahl: but guessing mine locations can still help to avoid moving into them
 izik1: my movement is literally "Can move right? move right. Can move left? Move left. Can move down? Move down. Can move up? Move up.
 eulerscheZahl: can surface? surface
 izik1: lol, that's just the default
 izik1: I don't even attempt to move after surfacing
 eulerscheZahl: yet you are in bronze
 izik1: Due entirely to my tracker
 izik1: yes
 eulerscheZahl: shouldn't be too hard to reach silver, now that you have a tracker
 izik1: Yeah, my rank gravitated to 147 bronze during my previous submit
 izik1: although, resubmitting puts me back down in the dregs&#160;;-;
 izik1: Because I do better against the higher rank people lol
 eulerscheZahl: i always gain some spots during the night
 Zandy156: I mean my bot moves that way and is currently rank 84 bronze.
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i need more battles to stabilize or i play well vs submit spammers
 izik1: Zandy: Yeah, but I bet you use more than Torps.
 Zandy156: nope
 izik1: :thinking:
 izik1: I mean, I _was_ rank 147 or so
 izik1: but like
 izik1: I guess you probably torp better than me
 Zandy156: I'm working on adding sonar right now. 
 izik1: mm
 eulerscheZahl: same bot again kovi?
 izik1: thread 'main' panicked at 'attempt to shift right with overflow' Thanks rust for saving me from myself ._.
 eulerscheZahl: do you like the language so far?
 izik1: I've been using it for quite the long time now (2017), but yeah totally
 izik1: (well, long time relative to how long I've been programming)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i somehow thought you just started with it for this contest
 izik1: lol
 Zandy156: Oh I forgot. My bot charges silence and uses it on turn 6. That's why mine is slightly better.
 izik1: see :p
 eulerscheZahl: in my memory you are a C# coder
 izik1: I'm basically an omniglot by this point
 izik1: work does that to you
 eulerscheZahl: not just poly but omni - wow!
 kovi: seems it was just lucky rolls vs. wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: random is strong with this game
 eulerscheZahl: the more sim-heavy, the more stable the ranking  from my experience
 izik1: lol, ranks decided to recalc right when I submitted, so my bot was at 268/269
 AntiSquid: still very low participation count
 AntiSquid: will it reach 2k at least?
 izik1: I'd hope so ._.
 izik1: Wonder what makes people not like this challenge all that much
 AntiSquid: is it not obvious?
 dbdr: izik1, yes! rust checking overflows in debug mode is very nice when it finds you a bug with no effort on your part&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i don't like it either izik1
 izik1: `saturating_sub` is a godsend too
 Asterixk: i find it challenging yes
 dbdr: when do you use it?
 dbdr: you speficially need that behaviour?
 izik1: clamping mostly
 Csipcsirip: and then you fix that overflow and your drank drops 10 places
 izik1: lol
 Csipcsirip: *rank
 dbdr: right, but only at integer size boundaries
 izik1: the overflow crashes my bot, so no
 izik1: saturating sub lets you clamp to zero
 izik1: for unsigned types
 dbdr: ah, 0 - 1 = 0?
 dbdr: yes, was thinking upwards
 izik1: 0.saturating_sub(1) == 0 yes
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: oh, useful for lives in OOC&#160;:)
 izik1: huh, didn't think of that
 dr.ivan: folks, could you help me out - I am kinda new to this. do I submit my code to get promoted from the wood league? then some more rules show up and I can edit my code again, or what?
 dbdr: if you want to store them unsigned
 izik1: I store most things unsigned
 izik1: heck, I store positions as a u8
 izik1: that's both x and y
 izik1: there's 2 extra values
 dbdr: life.saturating_sub(damage)
 izik1: yeah
 dbdr: how do you do it?
 izik1: I don't do anything that could cause them to have negative life
 izik1: so I don't
 izik1: wait
 izik1: do I crash if they- hah
 izik1: so
 dbdr: :D
 izik1: I do their life calculations _after_ I print my commands
 izik1: so I print, then my bot crashes
 izik1: but I still win
 izik1: because they die
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: that's dangerous
 dbdr: you print on stderr?
 dbdr: might work, but I would not trust it always will
 izik1: I do tons of stderr work
 dbdr: sure
 izik1: I print every single cell of the map every turn :p
 Asterixk: ole Bronze league
 izik1: Hello everyone this is H to the usky Husky here, back with some more BRONZE LEAGUE HEROS
 izik1: :p
 AntiSquid: :o
 Riyuk: Hi guys!
 izik1: Hey!
 Riyuk: Just lost one hour to understand that "|" should be escaped in the split function in Java --"
 Riyuk: Wanted to complain about that here!
 AntiSquid: well you will lose a lot more than an hour to understand a lot of other contest related info
 izik1: tfw accidentally submit spamming
 izik1: because I keep finding critical bugs
 izik1: like, spawning, going right, and then going left because there's a wall to my right
 izik1: because I didn't fill in the cell I spawned on
 izik1: I actually _used_ to have that solved, but I finally started preventing myself from spawning in corners, so I deleted that line by accident
 izik1: Wow, now that I've fixed that stuff I just shot through bronze ranks like they were nothing...
 izik1: at 20 now, only 60% submitted
 izik1: I might need to pull a tron
 izik1: 'Cept not qujite
 dbdr: what's pulling a tron izik1?
 izik1: I have a tron bot
 izik1: Space filling 
 izik1: Although, tron is a _lot_ more expensive
 Tunga: Greetings my lords!
 AntiSquid: tron costs 10 pounds more
 izik1: lol
 izik1: Also, my tron bot gets _worse_ if it has too much depth and I have no clue why
 anid: Who codes the bosses in ocean of code?
 wlesavo: everyone and noone
 anid: whaat?
 Illedan: anid, bosses are selected among the players on the leaderboard.
 anid: Ohhh, got it
 anid: thanks illedan
 AntiSquid: level 30, no avatar?
 blasterpoard: it's easy to get lvl 30 by submitting github bots like him
 AntiSquid: so much commitment and still no avatar!
 darkhorse64: 30K CP in 2 weeks. Looks like cheating
 blasterpoard: I saw his kutulu bot, it's a copy of morozec's bot
 blasterpoard: it prints "qwerty" after every yell...
 darkhorse64: Just look at his progress curve. Registered 10th of March. Guru on the 26th. I have signaled him to CG
 wlesavo: are there many bots that can be used without any modification? i thought most people cut there bots to some extent before posting them 
 wlesavo: their
 darkhorse64: Github is a treasure trove
 blasterpoard: wlesavo there are people who submit their bots to github without caring about the leaderboard, or they din't realize the repo is public
 wlesavo: i see
 Tunga: I dont even make one but an easy google search might reveal a top players bot 
 Tunga: He is right you know 
 Tunga: I am death for no reason, is this timeout&#160;?
 blasterpoard: Tunga replay?
 emh: oh phew double checked that my repo is private. got worried for a bit
 Tunga: Playing against bots, not submitted the bot 
 blasterpoard: you can still share it
 blasterpoard: even from IDE
 emh: from IDE? oh noes!? panic attacks need to hire someone to double check my every click
 emh: well I guess a CTRL+V with focus on chat instead of code window is all it takes
 blasterpoard: emh I meant the reaply
 blasterpoard: *replay
 emh: ah ok hehe
 emh: oh sideways snow
 emh: in April
 Tunga: Thanks for the help offer, I solved 
 Tunga: It is a silly mistake :D 
 Tunga: It is interesting that even in wood 1 league boss hits you directly 
 Tunga: Wow 
 Tunga: When I fire, I reveal the firing position to enemy
 blasterpoard: to get out of wood, you need to track the opponent and shoot only when you're reasonably sure you'll hit
 Tunga: I ll submit this random fire strat 
 blasterpoard: (at least, that's what was required before the boss nerf)
 Tunga: I think this strat will outsmart players here 
 Tunga: Here we go!
 Tunga: Boss won 3-1 against me 
 Tunga: I still wonder what this code does against players 
 Tunga: Looolll I won a lot just with a simple pathing and random torpedo fires
 izik1: Huh, thanks game
 izik1: gave me silver for no good reason
 Tunga: One guy really track me down shot me 3 times 
 Tunga: Siman submitted the code and #1 now
 struct: Damn 3 multies pending on contribution page
 AntiSquid: gotta play 'em all
 AntiSquid: total bot war looks nice :D
 AntiSquid: cute graphics
 PsyStorm: How can you track where the opponent?There is so much combination. Plus with the silence
 PsyStorm: How can you track where the opponent is?There is so much combination. Plus with the silence
 AntiSquid: write that again for a special prize
 PsyStorm: x0
 PsyStorm: I tought I could edit, but it reposted
 AntiSquid: no edits, anything you send will be seen and can't be unseen
 PsyStorm: I see that..
 darkhorse64: Worse, it is now recorded and searchable
 PsyStorm: :scream:
 AntiSquid: someone doing rounds with a motorbike outside, lol what happened to the lockdown?
 yfprojects: @darkhorse where do I find that?
 Tunga: Tracking enemy and navigating to it is a real issue
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page</a>
 AntiSquid: darkhorse so can you view it there?
 wlesavo: tracking chat messages
 Tunga: There is a hidden player in the wiki's ranking who is #1 and in front of euler
 Tunga: I am aware of that, thanks wlesavo
 darkhorse64: It's a bit experimental. I don't last week chat logs
 AntiSquid: last entry 25th of March
 Tunga: The issue is to get a guessing strategy 
 darkhorse64: *see*
 Tunga: I thought it is not a real ranking it seems 
 AntiSquid: so it's not automatically updated to filter swear words?
 darkhorse64: Ask dbdr for details
 dbdr: what's the question?
 Tunga: These guys are online 7/24, is it because of lockdown or codinggame staff working 7/24 :scream:
 darkhorse64: No sleep til Legend, that's the rule of contests
 Tunga: Then, I wont sleep for 17 days 
 Tunga: I cant be legend so here comes the insomnia :D 
 AntiSquid: actually i work from home Tunga
 AntiSquid: during lockdown anyway
 AntiSquid: dbdr question was why last entry on chat log wiki is 25th of May, is it because you filter out swearing or random spam or whatever?
 Tunga: They gave me day off, you know the economic sucks, automotive industry going down too and now covid :scream: 
 AntiSquid: i see i didn't respond to some questions in chat, going offline too quick in those chat logs :D
 Tunga: I am playing with bots instead working 
 dbdr: AntiSquid, no, it's because I didn't automate that part yet
 dbdr: and I did not do it manually
 dbdr: yet
 Tunga: Bots output is same with submit&#160;?
 AntiSquid: during submit they get +10 sentience bonus actually
 Tunga: I dont get it
 AntiSquid: no wonder humanity is doomed
 Tunga: :scream:
 Tunga: :broken_heart:
 emh: I ported my BFS to python3. it is about 10 times slower than C++
 emh: using numpy
 Tunga: I heard that numpy works very faster than usuals but never tried 
 Tunga: Oh lol 
 Tunga: emh do you time outed because of search&#160;?
 emh: I haven't submitted in a long time
 emh: but I had timeout protection in my C#
 emh: I guess it didn't time out that often
 emh: but didn't use this special BFS either
 emh: getting around 120k BFS in 50ms in python3. while 1 million in C++. in C# I used a garden variety BFS which was slow
 Tunga: C# is slow you know 
 emh: not thaat slow
 emh: but okay C++ is faster
 Tunga: You maybe cut the search in somewhere for python and use the best case available 
 Tunga: For not to get t/o 'ed 
 Tunga: Meanwhile I am trying to invent wheel
 Tunga: Not using regular algorithms but trying to figure out something :D 
 emh: oh I am not going to use python3 for this contest
 emh: just wondered how much slower the BFS was
 emh: because someone asked in the chat a few days ago
 Tunga: I dont know c++ and I am using python because of that 
 Tunga: It is good to do some experiment ofc
 Uljahn: emh: wow great, i'd like to learn from your bfs numpy code if you don't mind to share (maybe after the contest)
 wlesavo: also would be interested
 wlesavo: although my bottle neck now is damage map calculation
 emh: Uljahn wlesavo ok&#160;:) I just have to debug it a bit and check that it is correct
 Tunga: Silence jump can be done on the island's and traversed waters&#160;? 
 wlesavo: can even smitsiport you anywhere
 Csipcsirip: smitsiport?
 ToshiTuringMachine: no tunga
 kovi: damage map?
 Tunga: Is the jump counted as the water as visited 
 Tunga: We traverse on thee
 wlesavo: well i estimate average damage in each cell
 kovi: to assess long term path?
 wlesavo: to try to minimize damage from mines, yes
 kovi: (i only assess nearby cells atm)
 kovi: nice
 kovi: that would be costly for sure
 kovi: espec. for python
 wlesavo: well it is, yes, still timeout sometimes, especially against mchl12, i think he is doing something clever with mine planting, but not sure
 Tunga: I watch wlesavo 's replays and I love how he accurately knows the other players location and hit with torpido, awesome :D 
 wlesavo: i guess tracking and torpedos handling is pretty much the same across many top players, mostly silence mines and moves that makes the difference
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/QjmFPS6G">https://pastebin.com/QjmFPS6G</a> that's the python3 BFS code. it's a bit ugly because I'm not expert with numpy just googled it and hacked it together. I'm going to optimize it a bit further and make it look neater
 Csipcsirip: dou you have anything public like that in c ++&#160;? :p 
 Illedan: He is already strong enough emh :P
 emh: Csipcsirip nope but you can port it easily :p
 AntiSquid: execute python in your c++ code /s
 AntiSquid: wlesavo do you have a NN&#160;? or is that a real algo&#160;?
 wlesavo: thats a generous assumption :slight_smile: no just some simple estimations, with hardcoded limits
 ZarthaxX: i guess not even a search as it's python
 AntiSquid: banning ZarthaxX @_@ i still like python
 wlesavo: basically i looked at the values of the parameters i got at some boardstates, and figured out the limits i needed
 ZarthaxX: wasn't saying python is bad lol
 Csipcsirip: HerrHagner's bot is a good opponent to test your tracking performance
 Csipcsirip: I timeout like every time against him
 AntiSquid: need to be cautious, it's too risky to keep you unbanned ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: i will try
 wlesavo: Csipcsirip i think he only does silence 1, with same results you can take the illedan test bot if you want to test agains spam silence
 Csipcsirip: okay, thx
 wlesavo: it does not spend time charging anything else  :slight_smile:
 Csipcsirip: hm for some reason he doesn't make me timeout
 wlesavo: do you account for mines?
 Csipcsirip: yes I track mines  too
 wlesavo: well, im probably wrong then and illedan is not the bot to test against :slight_smile: mine tracking could also be costly
 Illedan: Manually add mines to my output :D
 tempux: Guys do use sets or bitmasks for keeping the visited cells?
 tempux: do you use*
 Csipcsirip: I use std::bitset
 Illedan: HashSet of Position
 Illedan: I'll move to bitmap when needing perf
 Zpooks: Im not really into any of this, but does this mean using a matrix to map cell info will become too costly eventually?
 struct: if py3 is 1st you should not worry about performance
 Illedan: Depends on what you need to do. Don't optimize unless you need it
 Zpooks: I was more asking because im curious, my day to day work doesnt really use any knowledge in performance or calculations.
 Zpooks: So its quite intimidating reading some of the discussions here haha
 Zpooks: Thanks for the answer =)
 wlesavo: struct i have some perfomance issues, probably could be better if optimized
 Csipcsirip: yes you use use 1d arrays when performance matters. 2d arrays are slower
 struct: Sure wlesavo, but python would never match c++ performance
 ZarthaxX: Csipcsirip have you proven that
 AntiSquid: ^
 tempux: What about keeping the possible paths of opponent? I am currently using a tree structure. But I have performance issue when trying to find mines
 Csipcsirip: I just use array of possible states
 tempux: so not the path?
 tempux: only the end position?
 Csipcsirip: state includes path, mine position, hp, cds
 AntiSquid: euler jumped high
 tempux: doesn't it get very big? sometimes the number of states exceeds 3000 in my code
 struct: it can be above 20k
 darkhorse64: CG allows  several hundreds of Mo for your process
 Csipcsirip: I drop paths when I reach 1k and keep only 1 of same states
 tempux: :thumbsup:
 Nagatwin: Csipcsirip do you have an hard-coded mine limit and store it into an array&#160;?
 tempux: me too
 Csipcsirip: I dont drop any info about mines
 2571540: Aw
 tempux: do you consider surfacing instead of going into cells that have high mine probability?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: oh wasn't asked but well...
 Csipcsirip: yes py path search algo gives a penalty to stay on cells with high mine damage probability
 Csipcsirip: *my
 tempux: I kinda get stuck in local minimums where I have to surface multiple times and die
 tempux: probably should consider using silence to jump over mines
 Csipcsirip: ahh no I misread it. I dont consider surface yet
 wlesavo: i do, but it started to work reasonably well only when my damage estimation improved 
 tempux: so your movement strategy depends on damage estimation?
 wlesavo: sure
 2571540: Csipcsirip don't you include the end positions for a path? Recomputing may be expensive
 Csipcsirip: oh yes I do, a
 tempux: how many step ahead do you calculate?
 wlesavo: around 15
 tempux: :thumbsup:
 wlesavo: with some simple greedy algo 
 Csipcsirip: I start with 19 in the 1st round. It goes over 50 when the space is limited
 tempux: your implementations should be very efficient since you are using python too
 tempux: I am getting timeout on 5 step ahead
 tempux: I will try to keep the path as a bitset instead of a tree and traverse it everytime. 
 AntiSquid: how do i increase timeout limit in local game, or rather where?
 2571540: You mean in the referee?
 AntiSquid: ya when i run locally @_@
 AntiSquid: found i think gameManager.setTurnMaxTime(50);
 eulerscheZahl: what do you search for? just pane filling? mine avoidance? opponent detection?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 AntiSquid: me? everything, wanna see how slow the bot really is if it wants to detect everything
 struct: im not sure you can increae the time further AntiSquid
 struct: If you do it will have less turns
 struct: max time per game is 30 sec
 tempux: I am trying to maximize (my damage expectation - opp damage expectation)
 tempux: and try not to make the grid disconnected
 tempux: for now
 eulerscheZahl: keep pushing me kovi
 AntiSquid: top 2 seem to be far ahead
 wlesavo: 38.99 :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: is it from submit spam&#160;?
 kovi: top2 beats me hard, but last run vs. euler i had 80%
 wlesavo: got pushed quite a bit yeah
 eulerscheZahl: that means i win something&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: struct how much will that reduce the total turns?
 wlesavo: but its back to normal i guess
 eulerscheZahl: oh, nevermind
 eulerscheZahl: pb killin me now
 struct: How much are you gonna increase it by?
 AntiSquid: one sec, let me see how much i need :p
 struct: 100 ms = 300 turns max
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl same here, the only below 50 winrate
 wlesavo: we just got our pandemic restrictions prolongated to the start of may
 Uljahn: same here
 AntiSquid: hm i time out but doesn't say why struct
 pb4: any idea why I fare better against you&#160;? maybe I'm so bad with mines your avoidance isn't useful&#160;? :D
 wlesavo: :grinning:
 pb4: -_-
 pb4: I swear when I watch my bot it's attracted to mines
 kovi:&#160;:)
 emh: wlesavo did you get anything from my numpy BFS? made another version here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/pyc6hfyB">https://pastebin.com/pyc6hfyB</a>. not much different but less temporary arrays and more imperative style
 wlesavo: emh thx, will look into that in the evening
 yfprojects: Do you use CG Enhancer?
 tempux: @emh is there a specific reason to use numpy?
 emh: tempux speed ofc
 emh: but only if you need it. I just made it for fun to compare speed with C++
 tempux: :thumbsup:
 Uljahn: emh: thanks
 Kanagawa1210: Hello guys! I'm watching a socket tuto with python 
 Kanagawa1210: does anyone understand 
 Kanagawa1210: what does this mean
 yfprojects: What does what mean?
 Kanagawa1210: print(f'{len(msg):&lt;{HEADERSIZE}}')
 Kanagawa1210: HEADERSIZE here is equal to 10
 Kanagawa1210: what I don't understand is the sign&#160;:&lt;
 Uljahn: google f-strings
 Uljahn: it's a sign for formatting i guess
 Kanagawa1210: I did google f-string
 Kanagawa1210: but i didn't find the sign
 Nan001: :X:X:X:
 RoboStac: it's for justification - &lt; is left justify, &gt; is right justify. The number ({HEADERSIZE}) is a minimum length
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab774f64-2ce8-4ac2-83da-1a10fbf301c0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab774f64-2ce8-4ac2-83da-1a10fbf301c0</a>
 yfprojects: So it works similar .format
 Uljahn: ye, Format Specification Mini-Language
 darkhorse64: emh: what's do your stats mean&#160;?
 darkhorse64: *what*
 emh: darkhorse64 the printout from my code?
 darkhorse64: yes
 emh: iterations the number of BFS iterations. it does 2 per call. you can separate them if you want. time is milliseconds for BFS on 120000 grids. the last number is BFSes per 50ms
 Uljahn: cool
 darkhorse64: OK. Got 65K. Did not imagine you could do bitboarding with Python. My target is more C++. This is just for the sake of curiosity as I don't think I'll need it for this multi. May be for XR or STC
 darkhorse64: Thanks anyway
 eulerscheZahl: at a certain point STC isn't about sim count anymore, but a good scoring
 darkhorse64: I have reached legend by improving scoring. I may get higher with a combination of brute force for the first turns and stochastic search for the rest. It's low on my list. Right now, it's reaching #100 for Gold tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: and then it's legend next week
 darkhorse64: For the moment, it looks like a desperate cause. I have a good tracker. At least, it matches your results but my motion sucks: it's a space filling algo from Tron and I have no idea how to improve. Let's first improve shooting
 eulerscheZahl: you are using my debug messages to verify your tracker?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 darkhorse64: Actually your MSG
 zemzgui: hi
 tempux: Oh you can use the mine command to eliminate some possible places
 tempux: I just realized :grinning:
 MSmits: huh?
 darkhorse64: I think tempux talks about the trigger command issued by an opponent
 MSmits: ah yes
 tempux: not the trigger
 tempux: the mine but is highly unlikely
 MSmits: please explain
 tempux: The rare case where all of the neighbors were mined before
 tempux: It is not that useful the more I think about it
 tempux: :grinning:
 MSmits: well you record the position from which an opponent places a mine
 MSmits: he would have had to place a mine from that position 4 times
 MSmits: which means he would need to surface 3 times
 MSmits: that doesnt happen
 wlesavo: not exactly form the same position
 MSmits: of course he would
 tempux: sometimes he doesnt have four options
 MSmits: you track location states
 MSmits: ah well then you must be tracking mines differently
 tempux: he is sorrounded by islands
 wlesavo: it is possible to plant quite dense, but yeah, not really a possibility
 MSmits: they way i track it isnt at all
 tempux: It is not that useful
 MSmits: I dont track mines, i track places from which a mine was laid
 darkhorse64: Not something that wins 50 places
 wlesavo: MSmits how you remove exploded ones then?
 eulerscheZahl: avoiding mine fields is important
 MSmits: I check if any of the 4 neighbors had a mine laid from them, i subtract 1 from the count if that is so
 darkhorse64: If a mine triggers and it can only be from a given location, you prune. Is that really effective&#160;?
 MSmits: if there are multiple options, i split the state
 MSmits: if no neighbor has a count &gt; 0  the entire state is pruned
 INORI: Hi 
 MSmits: it's an infallible method 
 INORI: Hi , i want an advice? (serious one) 
 eulerscheZahl: pruning by earlier mine placements on trigger helps
 MSmits: yeah it definitely does
 MSmits: do you still reset on surface eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 gives serious advice if you just ask
 wlesavo: MSmits regardles the time bomb was placed? that seems not very effective
 Automaton2000: i have a problem with the way i did it in a while
 eulerscheZahl: i think so
 INORI: I am working so hard in mycompany , but it doesnt pay me enough
 MSmits: wlesavo it is not regardless of time. The time is part of the path
 MSmits: actually let me explain it different
 MSmits: ly
 INORI: and i think in my country the competetion is like tough 
 wlesavo: oh, ok, undersstanded you wrong then, so basically same stuff im doing
 MSmits: each position state has a single position and a path. You note down the mine placement at the current position
 INORI: companies just take us for granted
 MSmits: that position might be wrong
 MSmits: but that will lead to later pruning
 INORI: oh sorry . i think im interrupting some conversation 
 MSmits: nah
 INORI: carry on
 MSmits: it's ok
 MSmits: if noone can interrupt me, this chat would be full of MSmits
 MSmits: like it sometimes is
 INORI: XD
 wlesavo: MSmits yeah, i got it, we basically doing the same
 INORI: so in meantimes if anyone want to answer me , pls let me know
 MSmits: kk wlesavo
 MSmits: i still have a bug in mine
 MSmits: not sure where it is, hope I find it today, then i can move on to some actual game logic
 2571540: Do you have any particular advice for uning bitsets in c++?
 MSmits: personally I feel you shouldn't. Just use bitboards
 2571540: My code with bitsets is way slower than the one using uint64_t
 MSmits: yeah i expected that
 2571540: Bit board? Bool[size]?
 MSmits: no, I do this:
 MSmits: uint16_t[15] for position maps
 2571540: Same
 MSmits: uint32_t[15] for mine maps
 MSmits: uint64_t[15] for damage map
 2571540: Damage map?
 MSmits: yeah to filter out damaged cells
 MSmits: if a cell has been damaged and the opponent hasnt, he cant have been there
 MSmits: but it works for every number ofc
 MSmits: 1 dmg, 2 dmg 3 dmg etc
 2571540: Oh yeah I have a different approach for this one
 MSmits: my uint64_t map can do 4 bit per damaged cell
 MSmits: so max 15 dmg
 2571540: I just keep trach on each path how much damage has been dealt, duplicating the paths for each torpedo or trigger and pruning at the end of the turns
 MSmits: how do you store your path?
 KarlTaal: Hi! I am new in here and I am wondering what should be the logic behind force-field in coders strike back? What should i do with it?
 2571540: Bitboard
 MSmits: ah ok
 tempux: guys do use any special algorithms for space filling?
 2571540: Thanks for the feedback on bit board
 MSmits: np, you're doing it right, it seems
 Csipcsirip: beamsearch
 tempux: currently I only try to avoid going into articulation nodes
 MSmits: KarlTaal it is hard to use logic for that. Once you get to a certain point, the only way to improve is a full simulation
 MSmits: and search
 2571540: Dfs randomized + pattern replacement
 2571540: Because I had everything coded already&#160;:')
 tempux: :thumbsup:
 KiwiTae: o/
 eulerscheZahl: BFS to take the biggest component when i screwed up already and have to decide :D
 tempux: oh yeah when it is disconnected you go to the bigger component. I do it too. 
 KarlTaal: Where is the point I should start using simulation rather than hard coded instructions? Right now I quickly reached to bronze but got stuck here now...
 eulerscheZahl: and that's all i do regarding the longest path
 eulerscheZahl: as there are aspects way more important than path size
 tempux: but it conflicts with mine avoidance :D
 eulerscheZahl: do you track your opponent based on the actions KarlTaal?
 Nagatwin: MSmits how do you find which position corresponds to each mine with your representation&#160;?
 KarlTaal: no i dont, what do you mean by tracking :D?
 Sneffy: KarlTaal Once you get gold you'll have full input so you could start sim here
 dbdr: full input in OOC gold? :D
 dbdr: that would be a surprise
 KarlTaal: Okay I know how to track the opponent, but what should I do with the information about other pod? I just can't think of any good logic that I could implement. 
 Nagatwin: I think they are talking about CSB
 Glenn: Torpedo the squares that your opponent is on
 MSmits: Nagatwin you don't. you only know from where they were laid
 MSmits: if a mine explodes, you just check if a mine was laid from one of the neighbouring cells
 MSmits: if that isn't the cas,e then the state is faulty
 MSmits: if there are multiple options, then you must split the state into x options
 Glenn: @KarlTaal, you can use that information to target your torpedos, move toward or away depending on your strategy etc.
 Nagatwin: So you do not invalidate positions when a mine explodes
 MSmits: I do
 Nagatwin: Hm
 MSmits: if there is no neighbor that has a mine laid from it
 Nagatwin: My point of view was&#160;:
 MSmits: then it couldnt have exploded there now could it?
 Valdemar: mine explosion can cause position increase then?
 Nagatwin: for each end_point, check if it could have placed a mine here, if not, remove it
 Glenn: @Nagatwin Depending on how much life you or your opponent lost (0,1,2) you can determine whether a mine was 2+, 1, or 0 tiles away from that sub respectively.
 Nagatwin: Glenn yes
 MSmits: Valdemar it usually causes position reduction
 AntiSquid: how can trigger cause an increase in positions? lol
 MSmits: Nagatwin I think so yes
 KarlTaal: Target my torpedos? Haha, we must be talking about different things. I am talking about coders strike back, racing, bronze league
 Glenn: @KarlTaal. Yeah, we are sorry. lol
 MSmits: AntiSquid if every possible state has laid a mine next to that position and some had multiple
 AntiSquid: KarlTaal there's a contest going on most people will automatically think about that
 Nagatwin: Trigger may increase paths but will reduce positions
 MSmits: depends on your state representation
 Nagatwin: Depending if you split the path at trigger or mine
 KarlTaal: Oh okay, I'm doing the coders strike back as an internship test :D
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: make sure you reset your code when you get to the next wood league
 Glenn: @Nagatwin Maybe, but it would be difficult to increase paths because you or your opponent would have to be close enough to the triggered mine to know which one exploded.
 AntiSquid: quite sure trigger will reduce paths / positions . otherwise i wonder how you manage your paths @_@
 MSmits: copy the code out, reset the code in the ide, and compare the input
 MSmits: the input changes
 MSmits: AntiSquid thats if you only look at the damage from explosions
 Nagatwin: Glenn if you keep track of who placed a mine when, you don't have to be close
 Valdemar: Glenn you can keep all possible paths
 MSmits: we also filter to see if a mine could have been laid at that position 
 MSmits: sometimes there is more than one possibility
 MSmits: and you need to split the state
 Glenn: I think that's true as long as you have your opponent's position down to a single possibility. Which is the case mid/late match
 Valdemar: didn't think about that, interesting
 Glenn: Early on, you'd have some uncertainty about where they laid the mines though right?
 MSmits: you'd have uncertainty late game also
 MSmits: you'll only know when they blow
 Glenn: If they use Silence well, yeah
 MSmits: there are multiple paths to the same destination
 Nagatwin: Im puzzled on whether your representation is better than mine. I feel like you loose some potential position filtering
 MSmits: because of silence yes
 MSmits: I dont see why Nagatwin
 Glenn: If you're using all your abilities though, you won't use Silence frequently enough to stop your opponent deducing your position if the game goes long enough
 MSmits: every game and opponent is different glenn... hard to say
 MSmits: depends on the meta
 Nagatwin: MSmits because I use the trigger information to filter end position for the paths
 MSmits: I do also
 Glenn: It's pretty rare that I don't have my opponent's position possibilities &lt;5 by turn 50 or so.
 MSmits: i prune states based on trigger
 MSmits: but there are two different things
 Nagatwin: does a state have several end positions&#160;?
 MSmits: -if a mine couldnt have been there, the state is pruned
 Glenn: ^
 MSmits: -if a mine could have been in more than 1 position from that state, the state is split
 MSmits: that second thingy is rare
 Glenn: ^
 Glenn: Yeah, I think we're basically saying the same thing. You're just saying it better. lol
 AntiSquid: automaton2000's balls were pruned
 AntiSquid: ^
 Automaton2000: only for the first time i see that
 Nagatwin: yeah it happens when mines are placed diagonally
 MSmits: Nagatwin do you store the mine location, or the place from which the mine was laid?
 Nagatwin: the delta of position from the current location
 MSmits: yes but is it the location of the mine
 Nagatwin: Nah
 MSmits: or the location of where the sub was when it placed the mine
 Nagatwin: the delta of the position when the sub placed that mine compared to its actual position
 MSmits: allright
 MSmits: then you should have the same kind of pruning that i do
 Nagatwin: because I check for every end-point of my path if it could have laid a mine there, and remove ones that could not
 MSmits: I do also
 Nagatwin: and if no end-point is left, therefore no mine could have been palced here
 Nagatwin: so i can prune the whole path
 MSmits: right, so we have the same kind of pruning
 Nagatwin: Can't figure out how youdo the checking for the endpoints without the deltas
 MSmits: I have a mine map
 MSmits: it's a bitboard
 MSmits: who needs deltas
 ZarthaxX: for each state right
 MSmits: yep
 ZarthaxX: you said you had a counter tho?
 MSmits: i do
 MSmits: 1,2,3
 MSmits: cant lay 4 mines from one position in my representation
 ZarthaxX: right
 MSmits: so i assume a player wont go 4 times to the same position by surfacing 3 times and laying a mine each time
 ZarthaxX: but i was thinking , if a trigger happens around the marked cell
 ZarthaxX: ah...
 ZarthaxX: it's because the enemy can pass by the same cell many times
 ZarthaxX: u gotta stack
 MSmits: yes, but he has to surface first
 ZarthaxX: well laid the mine
 MSmits: otherwise he cant lay from there again
 ZarthaxX: not pass by
 ZarthaxX: lay*
 ZarthaxX: yes
 ZarthaxX: so the custom bitboard is faster than bitset
 MSmits: I think it always is
 MSmits: if you do it right
 ZarthaxX: std is bad here mhm
 ZarthaxX: okey
 MSmits: but custom bitboard is inconvenient sometimes
 ZarthaxX: 2 bits per cell
 MSmits: for mines
 ZarthaxX: yes
 MSmits: 4 for damage, 1 for position
 struct: ZarthaxX even with -O3 enabled is slower
 Nagatwin: How do you fill up your mine map, because you have no idea of the exact player position at that time&#160;?
 struct: so is not CG fault
 MSmits: Each state is a position state, there is only one current positions and all mines are relative to it, kind of like your deltas
 MSmits: I used to have multiple possible origins, had to switch to what everyone else uses because of mines
 Nagatwin: hm
 wlesavo: MSmits i guess i didnt face nagra yet  :smiley: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444713712">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444713712</a>

 MSmits: without laying mines
 ZarthaxX: thanks for that info struct
 struct: you said std is bad here
 struct: I thought you mentioned CG
 Nagatwin: ah alright
 Nagatwin: what's the uint16_t for then&#160;?
 MSmits: path
 MSmits: visited cells
 Nagatwin: oh yeah
 wlesavo: struct depends on the enemy i guess 
 Nagatwin: alright so you begin with 225 paths (minus islands)
 MSmits: anyway, i have to go give my family some attention, been at work all day
 wlesavo: not very good in general
 MSmits: yes i do now Nagatwin
 Nagatwin: :o
 MSmits: i didnt at first
 struct: Probably no bot will do well there
 MSmits: ttyl!
 ZarthaxX: struct well in CG

 Norange: is anybody here a C++ programmer?
 darkhorse64: The chat is chock full of programmers for all langages
 tobk: too lazy to write code to try it myself: what exactly happens if you MOVE and SILENCE in the same turn? had an opponent doing this (on purpose or by accident) and it seemed to move but ignore the silence-move, is that correct?
 struct: no
 struct: you move 
 struct: then silence
 struct: maybe enemy did SILENCE dir 0
 struct: and stays in same place
 tobk: hm, I thought it was some value &gt; 0, but maybe I'll just try myself. thanks!
 kovi: #1 again&#160;;)
 wlesavo: for a sec =)
 eulerscheZahl: #3 \o/
 Illedan: #455 \o/
 kovi: when both you and siman in submit
 kovi: blasterpoard almost top10
 Csipcsirip: this game is so random I can end up anywhere between rank 10 and 40 with the same code...
 blasterpoard: kovi shh
 wlesavo: i just improved my damage map calculation, so it is much faster now wich allowed me to have more time on search
 eulerscheZahl: blasterpoard will climb a lot more i thinkdoing one part of the bot after another instead of rushing for ranks like me
 blasterpoard: I still ignore opponents' mines and I don't go for kills...
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i meant
 blasterpoard: and I crash
 eulerscheZahl: avoiding mines is what got me from rank 30 to top10
 eulerscheZahl: not crashing helped a lot as well :D
 tobk: I've heard good things about not crashing, too.
 wlesavo: had a crushing bot on #1 :smiley:
 struct: wlesavo new version_
 struct: oh chat scroll
 eulerscheZahl: crushing is much better than crashing for sure
 wlesavo: struct had some timeouts in previous version, so had to do smth with it
 blasterpoard: I put a bit of tape over the code that made the bot crash... maybe the result will be a rank or 2 better
 dbdr: I read "will be rank 2 or better" :D
 pb4: "eulerscheZahl 19H11avoiding mines is what got me from rank 30 to top10"  -&gt; let me test without my """"avoidance""""
 blasterpoard: maybe if it stops suiciding into the mines ^^
 wlesavo: dbdr same :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: my avoidance still needs improvement too
 eulerscheZahl: 1 turn lookahead is too little to avoid effectively
 dbdr: 4 of the top 10 are in sub
 eulerscheZahl: make that 5
 Csipcsirip: submit spammers -_-
 pb4: make that 6
 dbdr: let's make that 10
 pb4: damnit I nearly didn't count as top 10 -_-
 eulerscheZahl: let's do our own final recalc
 wlesavo: it is not spamming if the code have changed :wink:
 lNitsua: lmao did nothing but fix a bug resulting in a very rare failed move and got dropped from rank 3 to rank 90

 lNitsua: wow, didn't realize I typed a whole book
 lNitsua: tl;dr, how do I learn to program the bot to make good decisions
 wlesavo: thats a wide question
 lNitsua: The only way I was ever able to implement was in the card game, and it brute force tried every card on every other card and checked to see which series of cards was best
 lNitsua: that ended up timing out a lot, and on ocean of code there's too many options
 lNitsua: so, what do I learn from here
 Tunga: You need to determine a pattern here
 Tunga: It is hard to do actually (I am also new here btw, not a bot expert) 
 icecream17: Think of an idea that will make the bot better in a certain case.
 pb4: sooooo.... I'm not much worse if I disable the mine avoidance code -_-
 wlesavo: pb4 this version does not rekt me that hard
 wlesavo: or it is some luck
 pb4: Only one way to know :o)
 wlesavo: resub? :slight_smile:
 pb4: hehe
 kovi: stop resubmitting, i want to know where am i with mine avoidance&#160;;)

 Quidome: How is that decided? 
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo there's a difference between crashing and crushing&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: CG decides who the boss is
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl lol didnt thought of that one

 Astrobytes: lol, Wil Wheaton appearing at the end :D
 Zhmyh: Can we place a mine/shoot on the island?
 struct: No
 Zhmyh: ty
 wlesavo: what did the islands do to you
 dbdr: fdbdr
 eulerscheZahl: are you floating?
 dbdr: a Ctrl was missing
 dbdr: I got pinged and was looking for it
 tobk: hm, both game and description say "cant visit same location twice, using surface", but instead it seems to be instand-death?
 eulerscheZahl: right, otherwise it would be dbdrf
 tobk: yes, makes sense, but IMHO description and game output should be clearer/updated then
 dbdr: dbdrf32 in rust&#160;;)
 dbdr: or f64
 tobk: Description also says "If you fail to output a valid action, you will SURFACE in that turn. " but that's timeout (insta-death) as usual, too
 struct: its not insta death
 struct: you surface
 struct: if you dont output a valid action
 struct: if you dont output anything at all it is considered a timeout
 tobk: then that's the difference?
 struct: it mentions output
 tobk: if I print "GNARF" it's also an error nad insta-death, if I output nothing it's timeout, if I revisit a visited position the game says that I'm surfacing, but it's insta-death, too (had 6 HP then)
 struct: GNARF is not insta death
 struct: Unless it is in placement phase
 tobk: maybe it changed, but I just tried
 struct: You are right
 struct: It changed
 struct: it worked before I think
 tobk: I would really LOVE if all games with "abnormal" endings (timeout, invalid command, etc.) were somehow marked in the "last battles" view...
 eulerscheZahl: the CG API doesn't allow to search for them, unless you download every single one of your last battles&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: tobk do you use linux? I have a script for it
 Zenoscave: Still working on making it more user friendly but you can see games where you get a -1 score at least
 eulerscheZahl: there's a silent agreement not to share these scripts not to stress servers
 eulerscheZahl: if you want it, code it on your own
 Zenoscave: oh sorry did not know that
 Zenoscave: thanks
 <b>**eulerscheZahl has such a script too</b></p><p><img src="/a/37132928861372" /> eulerscheZahl: with some features for certain games like draft analysis for locam
 yfprojects: What if CG Enhancer would add this function? Or isnt that possible this easily?
 eulerscheZahl: not possible without spamming requests
 eulerscheZahl: like downloading 100MB when opening your last battles
 Zenoscave: I am not sure about that. doesn't it modify colors of battles you won/lost alreaady?
 Zenoscave: or is that only on position of rank not score
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you can filter for losses
 eulerscheZahl: still a lot of matches
 struct: Is this on TODO list for CG?
 eulerscheZahl: it's on requested features for a while
 eulerscheZahl: longer than i'm here

 Astrobytes: Looking promising though
 emh: just busy with BFS hehe
 Zenoscave: fair
 Astrobytes: How many iterations did you get finally emh?
 struct: performance is a trap
 emh: Astrobytes 1.5 million on one server
 Astrobytes: Niiiice!
 Astrobytes: gj
 emh: thx.. and that's using 64 bit registers mostly. there's potential for doing 4 in parallell using AVX2. for up to 6 million I guess. but I haven't gotten around to it
 Astrobytes: Post-contest project&#160;;)
 struct: It will be a bit lower than 6 mill
 emh: yes most likely
 Zenoscave: amdahl's law right?
 emh: I'm not sure all instructions have 256 bit extensions. and perhaps they take more cycles. different pipelining. different caching and so on
 dbdr: nice eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: dropped a bit at the end but still much better than i expected
 Astrobytes: Was a solid submit.
 Valdemar: has anyone run game locally using brutaltester?I've managed to patch run it with referee, and referee seems to work, but match results is not counted, always 0.00%
 eulerscheZahl: there's a fork from Zenoscave
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/ocean-of-code">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/ocean-of-code</a>
 Zenoscave: there's a few local changes needed I found some bugs in my PR
 Valdemar: yeah, I use code from there
 eulerscheZahl: he made a pull request but i'm not sure if i want to merge itthe official repo is about the game, not about automating it with a 3rd party program "brutaltester"
 Zenoscave: Yeah don't merge that 
 Zenoscave: bad idea
 Zenoscave: I will close
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine with adding a like to the readme
 Valdemar: i see that referee print out stats to terminal, like 2 0 in different lines, but brutaltester shows 0% as result
 eulerscheZahl: which brutaltester version are you using?
 eulerscheZahl: and new mode or legacy?
 Valdemar: 1.0 from artifacts
 Valdemar: i didn't pass any flags, so it should be the new one i guess
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that's fine
 eulerscheZahl: how did you call it?
 Valdemar: 
 Valdemar: it running ok, but shows End of game 1	 0.00% 0.00%despite of real results
 eulerscheZahl: so you have a folder structure like this:
 Zenoscave: the brutaltester calls the referee default on wood 2 (level=1) league
 Zenoscave: add -Dleague.level=3 in -r java string
 eulerscheZahl: brutaltesterocean-aitarget
 Valdemar: oh, but referee seems to running ok
 Valdemar: eulerscheZahl of courseIt runs normally and prints stats in terminal
 Zenoscave: How many lines total?
 Zenoscave: 3 or 4?
 eulerscheZahl: did you try to run the referee + bots without brutaltester?
 eulerscheZahl: you should get a single battle that way
 Valdemar: Zenoscave can it be related to log level? I didn't change that
 Valdemar: so referee prints many log info to terminal
 Zenoscave: it might be
 Zenoscave: I am not near my desktop but I'll push my changes once I can
 Zenoscave: to my branch
 YannT: I don't think I have the right thing for mine avoidance...
 YannT: I know where they likely are, but I can't figure out how to cleverly factor that in&#160;:/
 Valdemar: Zenoscave eulerscheZahl thanks for hintschanging log level in log4j.properties solved the problem

 Zenoscave: gz Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: you reverted to last weekend?
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: I did 4 tries on tracking and reworking :P
 Valdemar: well, it works but spamming with warnings sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass any suggestions?
 Illedan: Finally found something that is not too bad
 AntiSquid: hey you submitted a weaker version of your stream bot? Illedan, was wondering where it would end up if kept as it was
 Illedan: No. The stream is untouched
 Illedan: 200 in silver
 AntiSquid: ya weird, because it used to be 100 ranks above mine lol
 AntiSquid: and now it's close to mine
 Illedan: People evolve..
 AntiSquid: but i didn't improve my bot 
 eulerscheZahl: randomness
 Illedan: And that
 Illedan: Guess it was not really top 100 good at the time
 darkhorse64: Nice stream btw. it helps me figuring out I had a badly designed code
 Illedan: Thx
 Valdemar: eulerscheZahl I can see warning output in github readme. Did you try to work around that?
 Valdemar: In example game output placed on readme I mean
 eulerscheZahl: "WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance."
 eulerscheZahl: no, we ignored it
 eulerscheZahl: part of the SDK, every game gets that output
 eulerscheZahl: thus not my cup of tea&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: but it also keeps saying this:WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
 AntiSquid: for a long time, but you never know ...
 Zenoscave: they will anounce before removal
 Zenoscave: future problem
 Valdemar: but that output confuses brutaltester
 AntiSquid: WARNING: illegal violation infringement&#160;!!
 Valdemar: I don't bother about problems with game sdk either, but maybe there is some sort of hack to avoid that output?
 eulerscheZahl: does the new brutaltester still rely in input/output streams?
 Valdemar: yes
 Zenoscave: I believe so
 Valdemar: it reads info from referee, line by line
 eulerscheZahl: lazy solution: edit this file: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/test/java/Main.java">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/test/java/Main.java</a>
 Kathrin: Try running with java 8, this kind of things were introduced with java 9+ 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f258d2c-f679-40b6-ab01-f1dd81c8d4a8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6f258d2c-f679-40b6-ab01-f1dd81c8d4a8</a>
 AntiSquid: i thought i am on java 8 atm
 Kathrin: To be precise: oracle jdk 8
 AntiSquid: it says 8
 AntiSquid: i get the warning though
 Zenoscave: but you may be on open jdk
 AntiSquid: i guess, i don't really know the difference
 Zenoscave: different implementations of Java Lang Spec
 Kathrin: And sun.* classes are implementation specific, thus high risk that not all implementations have them
 Zenoscave: ^ this
 AntiSquid: java version "1.8.0_2xx" 
 Zenoscave: what OS AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: windows 10
 Zenoscave: I'm not familiar with java on windows
 eulerscheZahl: I'm not familiar with java or windows
 Zenoscave: that too
 AntiSquid: ugh i have java on ubuntu too, quite sure i get same error
 Zenoscave: Maybe we are wrong then
 AntiSquid: maybe i need to add more skill points into my java abilitiy
 Kathrin: I'm willing to trade, some java skills for a clue why my bot likes to timeout.
 eulerscheZahl: because you have too many iterations in your loop?
 eulerscheZahl: hard to tell without any knowledge about your bot
 AntiSquid: one of your loops never ends&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: if you play the turn offline, does it terminate?
 AntiSquid: for example it might keep searching for a specific solution and therefore get stuck
 Kathrin: yes termination is ok, it has to be loop count, but I have plays which should have more iterations without timeouts, and some with much less iterations that timeout. 
 eulerscheZahl: which language?
 Kathrin: kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: based on JVMcan garbage collection be a problem?
 eulerscheZahl: there was a kotlin heroes contest on codeforces recentlyyou were only allowed to code in Kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: was fun
 Valdemar: eulerscheZahl thank you, indeed simple and lazy solution
 Kathrin: may be, but up to now I blame the person in front of the screen not the system. 
 Valdemar: is it normal, that game is dead slow? like 1sec on one game or similar
 eulerscheZahl: for local testing? normal
 eulerscheZahl: some overhead for map creation, adding players (starting process), ...
 AntiSquid: yell at the person in front of the screen to fix it
 eulerscheZahl: do you timeout in the middle of the game? or at turn 1?
 Valdemar: yeah, I understood. There is no way to cleanup MultiplayerGameRunner instead of recreating it from scratch each time?
 eulerscheZahl: the recreate would still have to restart the bots with 0 memory, create a new map and all that
 eulerscheZahl: the brutaltester will have the same overhead
 eulerscheZahl: just multithreaded
 Kathrin: good question eulerscheZahl, I can't see it, my move is printed in the viewer but instead of beeing executed it gives me timeout
 eulerscheZahl: which is why agade always wrote his own local arena, closer bound to his bot
 eulerscheZahl: can you share a replay Kathrin?
 AntiSquid: ah what happens after that move in your code?
 AntiSquid: i mean after the output
 Kathrin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/444771023">https://www.codingame.com/replay/444771023</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the torpedo message is a known viewer bug, repeating your last command
 AntiSquid: i would check the BFS in your code first with that kinda replay 
 eulerscheZahl: might be the enemy tracking too, a bug with torpedo handling
 eulerscheZahl: run it offline, that's the best advice i can give you
 emh: hah.. first attempt at vectorizing the BFS using AVX2 failed miserably. performance tanked to less than half of before and number of CPU instructions doubled from ~600 to ~1200. not sure it's worth looking into
 AntiSquid: and the good news?
 emh: I had most of the "infrastructure" in place so it was easy to do
 ZarthaxX: emh i have to say, you are crazy with the bfs thing lol
 emh: ah yes I agree hehe
 eulerscheZahl: he showcased his craziness often enough
 emh: BFS is my Best Friend Soulmate
 Csipcsirip: emh I ported your python bfs. thanks. I too got 1m bfs. I have no idea how it works and didn't importve my rank, but still... :D 
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX weren't you higher rank?
 MichaelAlbert: hey bbs
 emh: Csipcsirip oh wow cool&#160;:)
 pb4: "emh I ported your python bfs. thanks. I too got 1m bfs. I have no idea how it works and didn't importve my rank, but still... :D "
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: wat lol
 pb4: I'm curious now :D
 pb4: Not that the performance would be useful, but I'm still curious&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/pyc6hfyB">https://pastebin.com/pyc6hfyB</a>
 pb4: Not the type of python is usually read :neutral_face:
 emh: I might as well post my C++ code too now that the cat is out of the bag
 emh: sorry Csipcsirip for making your port py code hehe
 emh: but C++ is bigger and full of various experiments
 emh: needs cleaning
 wlesavo: nice one, dbdr
 dbdr: thanks!
 dbdr: feeling good right now
 dbdr: let's see if this sub collapses at the end&#160;;)
 dbdr: I have good rates against everyone except siman it seems
 Astrobytes: emh, perhaps you could write a tech.io article about it, like M Smits did
 kovi: gratz dbdr
 dbdr: köszi!
 eulerscheZahl: the battle for the top intensifies
 dbdr: more and more people in the top 5
 aCat: Folks,  what is state of the art brutaltester repository&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: köstlich! dbdr
 aCat: I mean the newest version
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 aCat: oh ok, I've seen last update 6monts so maybe something had changed
 aCat: thanks euler!
 eulerscheZahl: no
 emh: Astrobytes do I need permissions from someone for that? or anyone can post?
 AntiSquid: anyone can post
 Astrobytes: I think anyone can emh
 AntiSquid: it's linked to your cg account Emh
 emh: ok found it
 dbdr: seems I still have a bad rate against you too kovi
 kovi: must have been a lucky roll for me
 Tunga: How can this wood 1 boss knows the exact location of me&#160;?
 Tunga: After 10 moves
 wlesavo: ezpz
 Tunga: :D
 Tunga: It tracks the every output
 dbdr: you keep saying that kovi&#160;;)
 wlesavo: wood 2 boss used to do that
 kovi: and i keep resubmit, to prove it
 dbdr: &gt;3 pts between #4 and #6
 emh: managed to trim C++ from ~1400 lines to ~500 lines hehe. still working on it
 icecream17: I made my code "better" but it made it worse.
 kovi: 3 pts is still within luck factor
 wlesavo: dbdr it was even funnier when we had same pts with kovi
 dbdr: with small probability I think
 dbdr: in gold there should be more matches, so somewhat less variance
 dbdr: exactly same?
 wlesavo: yes
 dbdr: nice&#160;:)
 wlesavo: for #1
 dbdr: would be interesting at the end of the contest
 pb4: What I hope is there'll be a proper rerun
 pb4: more matches isn't useful if there isn't some kind of averaging of the scores
 dbdr: it's still useful, though not as much as it could be
 wlesavo: do they usually do reran before counting the final score for the contest?
 dbdr: what makes a rerun proper?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: they add more matches for the top 100
 dbdr: legend only
 pb4: more games to get people roughly in the right spot - stop there - start recording average score - launch more games for everyone - rank based on average score
 pb4: or - even better - use the procedure we put in place for BR2048
 pb4: (see forum for this)
 pb4: nice, 3/1 vs siman on this push&#160;:)
 dbdr: hoping might not be very effective pb4&#160;;)
 dbdr: maybe raise the issue on the forum?
 pb4: I can't be bothered anymore. Have raised it multiple times already, including on the forum
 dbdr: I remember reading about an old contest where someone ran their own ranking of the matches
 dbdr: maybe it was you?
 pb4: Possibly&#160;:)
 pb4: I did something for STC
 pb4: and BR2048
 dbdr: as I said, more and more people in the top 5. pb4 is back
 pb4:&#160;:)
 pb4: It's so slow to update -_-
 wlesavo: pb4 do you track silence 0 now? :slight_smile:
 dbdr: at least the matches are reasonably fast
 pb4: might even be top2 or top3 given my last battles
 dbdr: I still don't get what it means to track silence 0
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: I'm not sure it's useful&#160;:/
 dbdr: don't you need to track all silences from 0 to 4?
 pb4: Not that many people do that
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: assume that people do silence 0 all the time
 wlesavo: well its useful against kovi :wink:
 wlesavo: well not assume, but deduce
 wlesavo: if they actually are
 dbdr: ah yes, remember now
 pb4: #2 this run
 wlesavo: probably not gonna matter soon
 kovi: 3 points less after resubmit....told you&#160;;)
 dbdr: wow
 Zenoscave: My bot occassionally has trouble with people in the 100s
 Zenoscave: Like serious 0-6 or 0-5 trouble
 emh: new record after cleanup 1.66 mill (vs 1.5 before). not sure why, just deleted a bunch of code (maybe constructor?). 330 lines of code left. maybe ready for tech.io now. just want to see what perf is without AVX compilation enabled first. can simplify code if not needed
 Tunga: You cant guess the other league when you play against champs
 Zenoscave: Tunga what does that mean?
 dbdr: emh seems you invented your own contest&#160;;)
 wlesavo: dbdr and he is really owning it
 Tunga: When you prepare yourself for good players, you cant play well against others more like a bunch of randomness in them 
 Zenoscave: not always true Tunga.
 emh: dbdr true hehe&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: in fact that shouldn't be nearly as often as it happens for my bot. I think I have a serious flaw
 Tunga: It might be
 emh: amazeballs.. dra meg baklengs inn i fuglekassa. actually I get 1.895 million without AVX. whyyyy? hehehe
 735487: I see an error reporting bug: invalid distance on silence: SONAR 10
 Astrobytes: emh, wtf does that Norwegian expression even mean?!
 735487: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444790043">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/444790043</a>
 Valdemar: sonar 10 indeed invalid command
 kovi: seems copypaste bug
 emh: Astrobytes it's from animation movie. a small bird getting the mail by climbing into the mail box and he says "pull me backwards into the mail box". an expression of surprise
 735487: i know. just an error wrong. just wanted to let know if it does matter
 wlesavo: well still the referee recognized that error wrong, yeah
 egaetan: emh still interesting to to see avx, even if it slower
 Astrobytes: emh cool, I get it!
 emh: egaetan well I want to simplify as much as possible for the tech.io article. there are other articles about AVX
 icecream17: So if you're trapped, is it better to suface and then silence, or silence and then surface?
 JBM: the one where opponent knows the least where you end up
 JBM: but then again
 JBM: if you can silence, why surface?
 kovi: if you are entrapped by mines or your own trail silence itself not help much
 YannT: heyooo top10!
 YannT: got the sim to work&#160;:)
 JBM: gg
 emh: github is down? getting timeouts and errors
 pmor: I'm getting the same
 YannT: I'm gonna repush without the timeout issue tho, that'll probably be better
 YannT: there, no timeouts :hugging:
 AntiSquid: and no calories <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/XWo627F7CeU?t=19">https://youtu.be/XWo627F7CeU?t=19</a>
 Astrobytes: Like the Monkey reference there
 AntiSquid: is there a way to run local games faster? damn this is slow
 YannT: using brutaltester?
 AntiSquid: ah .
 AntiSquid: but i am doing something else&#160;:/
 YannT: it can thread tho so that would be faster
 Astrobytes: Or make your own arena
 Tunga: Random pathing is terrible
 Tunga: I made my pathing random and lost like 100 rank instead of simple pathing 
 AntiSquid: actually nvm, yeah prolly should switch to brutal tester
 Tunga: Wood 1 boss knows my exact location after a silence jump wtf 
 Astrobytes: It's watching you Tunga
 AntiSquid: eh?
 AntiSquid: you doing something wrong p[erhaps
 Tunga: Does it reads the debug messages&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: no
 Tunga: I reveal my location in my debug 
 Astrobytes: You can pass Wood 1 with just silence iirc
 AntiSquid: before boss nerf i managed to promote with just silence
 Astrobytes: Same
 Astrobytes: Oh no wait, I think I was the day after or something but I had 100% against boss. Boss was nto the problem.
 Astrobytes: (before nerf)
 Astrobytes: Still a bit iffy about this nerfing business tbh
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: trying to group all in the middle of the ladder
 AntiSquid: nerf bosses, stream mid silver bot :p
 Tunga: LOL I lost 250 rank with swtiching into random movements 
 AntiSquid: why did you try random anyway
 Tunga: I was bored 
 AntiSquid: what's the motivation
 AntiSquid: aha
 wlesavo: wow, pushed to 39 pts
 AntiSquid: you have some seriously strong lead
 AntiSquid: you need to keep going though, people at the top tend to catch up incredibly quick&#160;:/
 Tunga: I need to make movements better 
 Tunga: After that I need a decent tracking
 Tunga: This thing just got serious
 wlesavo: still have some unused time turn, so probably will come up with smth, but yeah, not hoping to keep that for long
 Astrobytes: holy shit, what did you change?
 Tunga: I made a accurate torpido firing which made me into bronze I guess
 AntiSquid: torpedo
 wlesavo: Astrobytes just made some calculations quiker, so have more time for search, also not timing out anymore, that helps :slight_smile:
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search</a>
 Astrobytes: gj wlesavo
 wlesavo: thx, still surprised this bot doing that good
 wlesavo: wouldnt ever expect that
 AntiSquid: switch to c++&#160;?
 wlesavo: my c++ is bad, so probably wont get any improvement
 Astrobytes: Good time to improve it no?&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: best time to learn a new language is during contest anyway
 Astrobytes: ^
 lNitsua: learning C for this one
 lNitsua: I've come alot further than I expected
 wlesavo: well maybe you right, but i would have to give uo this one and now im curious how far can this go
 Astrobytes: emh it's faster without auto-vectorisation?
 AntiSquid: just translate the bot wlesavo
 struct: yes 
 struct: no
 emh: Astrobytes yes
 Astrobytes: And faster with your duplicate manual loop unrolling?
 emh: ah yes but I added that before removing avx
 emh: didn't try without unrolling after that
 AntiSquid: damn it, i am finally about to start making an improvement (i believe so at least) but i am too sleepy to keep going Q_Q
 AntiSquid: gn7
 AntiSquid: gn8
 emh: so right now there are 4 calls per loop. you can get away with 2 by removing duplication and 1 call per loop if you swap some variables
 emh: AntiSquid gn
 Astrobytes: Similar issues here squiddo, gn
 Tunga: Yea AntiSquid, gn
 struct: Did you try manual vectorization yet?
 Tunga: I was fired up but, I have work tomorrow and this random movement submit lost 100 rank for me :D 
 emh: struct partly but not much and not seriously. have some code for it if you want but it's not good
 struct: nah its fine dont worry
 struct: but should be possible
 emh: kk
 Tunga: Any button on ide saves the current version of the code&#160;?
 Illedan: Submit
 Illedan: Saves it in history
 Illedan: I recommend coding locally though
 Illedan: and use git
 Illedan: for sanity
 Tunga: Play my code doesnt save? 
 Illedan: It saves yes
 Tunga: I like the hardness in this ide 
 Illedan: hardness?!
 Tunga: Using only print for debug 
 Tunga: Not tracking issues on a ide 
 Tunga: Thanks for the info, gn everyone 
 Astrobytes: You can debug offline Tunga
 emh: gn Tunga
 Astrobytes: woops, too late
 kovi: nice, illedan is back in top
 Illedan: Yeah, simple if(Illedan) GiveExtraPower()In the referee, was very effective
 pb4: how much for the same if(pb4)&#160;?
 Illedan: :thinking:
 emh: pb4 can you improve on my BFS code? more million iterations :D&#160;?
 wlesavo: pb4 stop bulling me :slight_smile:
 ZarthaxX: Illedan how did went to top so fast? LOL
 Illedan: I submitted something good?
 Illedan: *decent
 wlesavo: spam silence N 4 
 ZarthaxX: i mean
 ZarthaxX: didnt you stop working on bot for days?
 Illedan: Nah, I have been working on my tracking for very long
 Illedan: between work, fixing the referee and a few reworks. It just took some time
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: search or heuristics?
 Illedan: React
 ZarthaxX: wot
 Illedan: Some searches and some reactions to current state
 Illedan: but far away from top 3 yet
 Illedan: long way to the top
 YannT: I have to rewrite my entire eval
 ZarthaxX: ah ok, ty
 YannT: it's basically made of bubblegum and random things
 Illedan: Yeah, I have a 20 in here. Which I wrote without testing and assume it was all good.
 YannT: score += 50 + (availableSpace - previousSpace) / 10
 YannT: I have stuff like that
 YannT: why 50, why 10, no one knows
 YannT: I also divide the probability of mines  by 5 for some reason
 YannT: I really have to redo all of that ahah
 wlesavo: i think available space is overrated by many players
 pb4: Obviously the 5 directions you can lay them in
 YannT: wlesavo: this is why it's divided by 10&#160;!
 YannT: there is a method to my stuff somewhere
 YannT: some sort of sense is in there, it's just hard  to see :p
 YannT: I really have to rewrite all this janky ass stuff so it can be tuned, that'll be the first mission once in gold
 DomiKo: guys
 DomiKo: when gold will be open?
 ZarthaxX: tomorrow
 DomiKo: but its 4/3/2020
 emh: today then
 emh: around 18:00 usually
 DomiKo: ohhh ok
 DomiKo: thx
 emh: what's the current meta? any discoveries of new techniques since opening of Silver? was too preoccupied to pay much attention hehe
 emh: I guess I will start porting my C# to C++ now
 Illedan: Torpedoing the enemy sub is currently very strong
 ZarthaxX: who would have told
 Illedan: But I'm aiming for the pacifist award
 emh: ohh I was losing to that already last time. that's why I lay mines and hide
 ZarthaxX: laying mines and waiting Illedan?
 Illedan: Yeah, make a castle out of mines
 Illedan: and just sit there
 ZarthaxX: funny phrases drawn with mines
 Illedan: :D
 emh: and it turns into minesweeper
 Uljahn: you can't just sit, you should trigger at least
 izik1: &gt;  You can't trigger multiple mines in the same turn. You can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn.
 Illedan: Suicide on your own mines for the greater cause?
 izik1: But can you place a mine and trigger a different one?
 Uljahn: ye
 Illedan: ye
 JBM: yes
 JBM: -s
 YannT: no ones tries to put mines everywhere and just trigger while not moving, see if the ennemy kills himself :D
 Illedan: The first version of the mines was triggering when the Sub moved on top of the mine and not with a command :P
 izik1: I can't tell how that effects the balance of them, pretty complicated implications there
 Uljahn: so unfortunate silence could instakill :smirk:
 Illedan: hehe
 izik1: Pretty sure mines can still instakill
 izik1: just need to lay them in a +
 YannT: it's more complicated with manual trigger, because you have to guesstimate if you're "hidden" enough that they won't try it
 Illedan: Yeah, glad we did triggering
 izik1: yeah, there's a good bit of complexity both ways
 izik1: if you layed a mine and someone triggered it by stepping on it, that would reveal your position at <time></time>
 izik1: well, down to 4 tiles anyway
 izik1: I might be working on my tracker for another few days to handle mines
 izik1: _tons_ of interactions going on with them
 izik1: Every mine trigger can potentially give a _lot_ of info
 lNitsua: when you say trigger it by stepping on it, does that mean in silver+ mines explode by contact? I'm in bronze and it's only through trigger
 izik1: no
 izik1: that was an idea
 izik1: that didn't make it to the current version of the game
 lNitsua: ok thx
 YannT: izik1: spoiler alert, it actually does&#160;;)
 YannT: well most of the time it doesn't, except sometimes it really really does
 izik1: :thinking:
 reCurse: 10% of the time it works every time
 YannT: basically if one triggers a mine laid before a silence, it won't discriminate the branching that the silence(s) since caused
 YannT: except in that one case where it will remove a path AND the entire branching that happened since with silences and really clean stuff up
 izik1: yeah, as I said, potentially a lot of information
 izik1: It doesn't _always_ give it
 izik1: but it can give a lot
 emh: well good night
 izik1: \o
 Illedan: gn
 izik1: For now I just have to figure out how mines work into my model
 YannT: score -= 100 * (8 - life)
 YannT: :unamused:
 YannT: yeah, really  have to rewrite my eval ahah
 izik1: I don't sim *shrugs*
 YannT: it's full of seemingly random stuff that  kinda does a thing, sometimes
 izik1: lol
 Illedan: It's something! (sometimes)
 izik1: Sounds like my code Royale bot tbh
 izik1: "kinda does a thing sometimes maybe"
 izik1: My mean max bot is still sitting at bronze 2 lol
 YannT: thanks kovi you pushed me a lot&#160;;)
 Asterixk: crap got to silver too soon
 Asterixk: someone beat Cpt Iglo so hard they pulled me up from 5th
 Asterixk: I don't even mine or silence, barely track oppPos
 wlesavo: kovi went from silence N 0, i guess i can delete that part of the code now :slight_smile:
 kovi: maybe i skipped for you only
 kovi: or not
 kovi: you never know
 Zenoscave: illedan do you combine code as post build step?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: I have a process checking every 500 ms and updating if something new :P 
 Zenoscave: what is the code combiner process do?
 Zenoscave: just wrap each file in a namespace and cat?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger</a>
 Zenoscave: thanks
 icecream17: i need some non abstract ideas...
 TidyMaze: eat chocolate
 icecream17: great idea
 icecream17: but still unachievable
 TidyMaze: is the concept of chocolate too abstract&#160;?
 icecream17: no.......
 icecream17: i dont have chocolate
 TidyMaze: :S
 icecream17: what does that mean? moustache?
 TidyMaze: eyes + weird shape mouth, like a&#160;:(
 icecream17: makes me wonder about other shapes
 icecream17: Z, W, Q, k, &amp;, @
 TidyMaze: well, I mostly came here to steal ideas from wlesavo, but talking about shapes is fine too&#160;:)
 icecream17: I need to track paths, sometimes you can move down after you silence and sometimes not, but I only have a MainPath string now.
 icecream17: I wonder how the person who did an AI is doing
 wlesavo: TidyMaze well more or less most part of what i do been discussed already, its mistery to me how this bot doing so well right now
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: do you have big things on your todo-list that you expect will improve your bot&#160;?
 icecream17: Ugh, it says "bug = true" at "move 62", turn 147
 Radewoosh: Is any admin here?
 wlesavo: pb4 mostly thinking about planting mines more effectively, to screw up mine escaping, seems to be an important thing, but dont know if i would have enough perfomance for that
 wlesavo: probably will have to make smth simple
 wlesavo: i already cuted out some costly ideas
 Radewoosh: Guys
 Radewoosh: Are you playing ocean od code?
 Radewoosh: Or do you just happen to know the rules
 Radewoosh: If the opponent prints for example TORPEDO            1          2
 Radewoosh: Will I see multiple spaces?
 struct: no
 kovi: nope
 Radewoosh: ty
 Radewoosh: is it true that I can get no spaces?
 Radewoosh: for example after "|"
 YannT: you can output spaces, the referee will sanitize
 Radewoosh: ...
 Radewoosh: I'm asking about the information about the opponents' moves
 YannT: it will always be well formated by the referee
 Radewoosh: and what does it mean
 Radewoosh: Where can I find any info about the exact format of the input
 YannT: there's no spaces around the |
 Radewoosh: Great that there is such one in the statement
 YannT: "Output for each next turns" section of the rules (last one)
 YannT: oh yeah, the example in the statement is wrong :D
 icecream17: If you torpedo too far, say "TORPEDO 14 14", will the opponent see that?
 YannT: no
 YannT: opponent will not see illegal actions
 YannT: (and your torpedo cooldown is still reset)
 Radewoosh: are you an admin?
 Radewoosh: Yannt
 Radewoosh: or maybe you just happen to know when can we send some feedback about the details of the contests

 Nanosplitter: Does anyone know an efficient way to reverse a subset of bits inside an integer in C++?
 Nanosplitter: Like if I was dealing with a 10-bit integer 0010110101, and I wanted to reverse position 3 to 7, I would reverse these bits: 001|01101|01and it would become 0011011001

 DragonJ: yes
 jrke: Dragonj whats your league in CSB
 AbundantPuddle: I don't remember a velocity angle or distance angle in CSB. I only remember there was a distance from the checkpoint and angle to checkpoint. I was only in bronze league though. 
 jrke: CSB is easy till gold

 ArianPunk: guys, i get correct output in my local pc, but different in CG
 ArianPunk: what's wrong?
 ReborN: using random&#160;?
 ArianPunk: first test should be correct
 ArianPunk: or even more than one test
 ArianPunk: 3 tests out of 5 are correct in my local PC, but only the 2nd test in CG showing me correct output.
 ArianPunk: WTF
 WINWINWIN: Just learnt Floyd Warshall and used it in GitC anyone can advice a nother puzzle or game where I can use it?
 Uljahn: any grid- or graph-based game?
 Uljahn: e.g. using it in platinum rift
 Uljahn: there are large maps in PR2, so have to use scipy in python
 wlesavo: there are actualy not that many games on cg where you need a path searching on weighted graph,   at least from what ive played
 wlesavo: but you can still use fw instead of bfs i guess
 WINWINWIN: Ty wlesavo, Uljahn but I dont think that some of the games have weighted graphs that can be precomputed
 WINWINWIN: Will try it out in PR
 wlesavo: lol 7 acceptions on yinsh
 struct:&#160;:(
 jacek: universe doesnt want yinsh
 ArianPunk: anyone knows why I'm getting correct output on my PC but not in CG
 ArianPunk:&#160;?
 struct: validators are differnt from test cases
 ArianPunk: but still
 ArianPunk: my code is generalized
 struct: What puzzle?
 ArianPunk: MIME
 struct: language?
 ArianPunk: C
 struct: paste the code here

 ArianPunk: my code doesn't work on capitalized file formats (i.e. TXT&#160;!= txt)
 ArianPunk: but still it is giving me correct results when used for lower-cased file formats.
 ArianPunk: That means, the first three cases are ok on my PC, and I know they are all lowercase on CG as well. So, there shouldn't be a problem.
 wlesavo: 4th case have capitals
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3878b667-f2c9-497b-94f5-9c46d7a6fd80">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3878b667-f2c9-497b-94f5-9c46d7a6fd80</a>
 ArianPunk: yes
 wlesavo: oh i misread
 ArianPunk: but not the first 3
 Uljahn: looks like your code only prints UNKNOWN on CG, you could use debug output to find the cause
 ArianPunk: I generalized to upper and lower case, and still no change.
 ArianPunk: Although I get correct output on all cases on my PC
 ArianPunk: Where to debug output in CG?
 ArianPunk: It doesn't always output UNKNOWN.
 Uljahn: are you using the same compiler as CG's?
 ArianPunk: Try the first case and you will see that only the 1st out of 3 outputs is UNKNOWN
 ArianPunk: I don't know.
 ArianPunk: mingw
 ArianPunk: mine is.
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 ArianPunk: I checked the url.
 ArianPunk: it says CG's is GCC.
 ArianPunk: I don't think that's the problem.
 Uljahn: also there is a commented line with debug print in the default code
 ArianPunk: yea, so?
 RoboStac: you've removed an fgetc(stdin) line from the stub code so you aren't reading the inputs correctly
 ArianPunk:  i fflushed it
 ArianPunk: You're correct
 RoboStac: fflush doesn't do anything on an input stream
 ArianPunk: Thank you. Now only the last test is incorrect.
 ArianPunk: I used fflush coz' in stack overflow some have suggested on some posts.
 ArianPunk: I used fflush in another script and it seems it worked.
 Rafdune: Hi everybody&#160;!
 ArianPunk: hye
 DevelopWithAP: Hi everyone
 kovi: very nice neumann
 Neumann: Hardcoded&#160;:/
 kovi: not nice then
 Neumann: Last non-hardcoded was 10607
 kovi: that is still nice
 Neumann: Yup
 Neumann: But not enough to beat a NN :D
 kovi:&#160;:)
 ArianPunk: Robostac you are in Manchester?

 Tiramon: @WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: Tiramon tried that :D 
 Tiramon: gives me a pretty precise answer to that question&#160;;)
 WINWINWIN: people only say dictionary, wanted to know if there is a better alternative
 Astrobytes: If people only say one thing, that should give you an idea
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:(
 Uljahn: try associative arrays :smirk:
 Neumann: wlesavo: all of them
 darkhorse64: How much can we reach without hardcoding&#160;? sub 11k&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Sorry, the answer is in the scroll
 jacek: harcoding? were?

 struct: Sub 11k is possible yeah
 wlesavo: wow, thats hardcore hardcoding Neumann
 ArianPunk: Guys, are google Facebook etc. employees play CG too?
 ArianPunk: Do*
 ReborN: Some for sure
 ArianPunk: what are the competitors of CG, if any?
 ArianPunk: I mean other websites similar to CG.

 ReborN: CG design and UI looks so clean compared to some of their main competitors
 ArianPunk: Yeah, my thought the same.
 ArianPunk: I see no reason to join them
 ArianPunk: Are there any Rankings for CG like games as well?
 ArianPunk: CG-lie websites*

 Astrobytes: Are you gonna continue with alphabeta or try a different algo?
 cegprakash: Done with Oware
 cegprakash: out off ideas
 cegprakash: I'm planning lot of streams forward
 Uljahn: the only true rekt is reking maddy in csb :smirk:
 cegprakash: paper soccer, search race, fantastic bits and then UTTT

 jacek: in uttt?
 Astrobytes: no, oware
 cegprakash: Astrobytes my eval only has 4 params
 cegprakash: I reached #18 without knowing how to play Oware

 Astrobytes: lol robo
 cegprakash: I only have 4 and I'm above u
 cegprakash: meaning ur params are bad or ur depth is bad
 Astrobytes: above me?
 Astrobytes: In Oware?
 cegprakash: I'm #18
 cegprakash: above euler
 nocturnalmachine: anyone ever seen a good article, write up, book on the different ways math is applied to solve problems (in the context of programming)?
 cegprakash: euler is #19
 Astrobytes: I'm 7th, above you cegprakash
 cegprakash: oh sorry
 cegprakash: I confuse between u and AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: How is that even possible?
 Astrobytes: :D
 cegprakash: coz both ur names start with A
 cegprakash: and u both troll me
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: You love it
 jacek: euler starts with A?
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I helped you with your Oware, so I got a free pass to troll you harder
 cegprakash: u deserve it
 cegprakash: u earned it
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl never teaches me things
 cegprakash: I cry to him how to find timeouts
 cegprakash: no. of timeouts
 cegprakash: after submissionn
 cegprakash: he doesn't share script
 Astrobytes: Write your own! Hard work goes into writing your own tools you know
 dbdr: I think the best would be to lobby CG to provide the info
 cegprakash: but I don't get it
 dbdr: make it visible in last battles
 cegprakash: what's the point in building if u don't want others to use it/learn from it
 dbdr: then it would be easy to script cheaply as well for everyone
 Astrobytes: Meh. We've been requesting that for as long as I've been around at least
 dbdr: there is a specific reason not to share it
 dbdr: didn't he say?
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>i shared a lot with that already
 dbdr: by the way, eulerscheZahl, do you use the small or the big replays?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: leaderboard last battles
 dbdr: there are several APIs to get replay jsons
 Uljahn: with api key provided?
 eulerscheZahl: let me guess: IDE last battles are slightly different?
 dbdr: I think that's the small one, so&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: there is one that includes the complete code of the javascript viewer inside the json&#160;:/
 Uljahn: ah, i though of the difference in debug output
 Astrobytes: lol, wow
 dbdr: I think that's what <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay">https://www.codingame.com/replay</a> uses, because otherwise it would not even know what game it is
 dbdr: but they could have used one indirection, to avoid sending it each time...
 eulerscheZahl: oh right. i don't have that inside the response.json()but it seems i get it without the json() part
 eulerscheZahl: didn't investigate tbh
 dbdr: that does not sound right to me
 dbdr: isn't json() the parsed version of .text&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you can even test it with my playground
 eulerscheZahl: wget on page 2
 eulerscheZahl: is with JS
 eulerscheZahl: findInformationById
 eulerscheZahl: oh, my python uses findByGameId
 dbdr: so you use the big one then&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: no, small
 dbdr: well, the one that has the JS
 dbdr: so your scripts don't use it, but your playground does?
 eulerscheZahl: that wget was just to show how to get access. the python is what i do for my actual analysis
 dbdr: might be good to update the playground
 eulerscheZahl: true
 dbdr: avoid more people hammering the servers
 dbdr: Astrobytes: yeah, probably json that contains js that contains json...
 Astrobytes: Nice...!
 dbdr: frontend development culture is not very efficient
 Astrobytes: Clearly! Gone are the days of keeping things lightweight eh
 dbdr: those who care do get a benefit though
 dbdr: fast website =&gt; more users, more happy users
 Astrobytes: Indeed. I suppose it applies to general development too, unless it's embedded stuff people are just lazy about resource usage and afficiency
 Astrobytes: *efficiency

 Astrobytes: Yeah that's a good one jacek
 eulerscheZahl: i updated the playground dbdr
 Astrobytes: looool Zarthanderthal
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl :bow:
 eulerscheZahl: :bow_arrow:
 eulerscheZahl: :bow_and_arrow:
 ZarthaxX: lmao Astrobytes
 cegprakash: euler
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl ur link asks gameId
 cegprakash: can't find gameId
 cegprakash: 1 by 1
 cegprakash: If I can spend time to get the gameId 1 by 1 then I would have time to watch the replay 1 by 1
 cegprakash: the point of a script is to reduce time
 cegprakash: I know u are doing it
 cegprakash: and u don't share how u get all game Ids
 ZarthaxX: stop annoying him lol
 cegprakash: I like him
 ZarthaxX: but he doesnt have to give all the code he did to you
 cegprakash: but he only shared half the part that comes late
 cegprakash: first half part he didn't share
 ZarthaxX: many ppl did tools and they dont share code
 ZarthaxX: i dont see a problem..
 cegprakash: I don't want eulerscheZahl to be one of them
 ZarthaxX: he shares enough 
 ZarthaxX: i dont think it's that hard to elarn it yourself
 wlesavo: i think he even shared replay grabber for ooc in chat 
 ZarthaxX: the page one
 Astrobytes: ceg I think euler has been more than generous
 eulerscheZahl: the link does not only give code but also teach you how to understand the API on your own
 cegprakash: hey I tried it
 cegprakash: the html only shows gameIds that are in the view
 cegprakash: I don't want to implement scroll action using selenium to get the gameIds
 cegprakash: it's too much effort
 eulerscheZahl: and you saw the thibpat stream. he did almost the same as me
 cegprakash: he doesn't find timeouts
 cegprakash: he only debugs a particular game
 eulerscheZahl: he gets the replay json
 cegprakash: but u showed me "15 timeouts in 90 games"
 eulerscheZahl: then just parse it and check for a tooltip saying that you screwed up
 cegprakash: and u did it in like 10 secondns
 cegprakash: how do u get the gameIds
 cegprakash:&#160;:\
 jacek: tulips and daisies, puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: how do you get a list of battles as a human?
 eulerscheZahl: go to leaderboard, open last battles
 eulerscheZahl: how to get the API call? see my playground for answers
 cegprakash: so u implementned scroll action?
 cegprakash: to scroll through all the games?
 eulerscheZahl: no, just using the API without any webbrowser frontend
 eulerscheZahl: the API gives you all games
 eulerscheZahl: that's the same way as CG stats gets your winrates. 1 call to get the last battles
 eulerscheZahl: and CG stats is open source btw
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cgstats/blob/master/cgstats.js">https://github.com/dreignier/cgstats/blob/master/cgstats.js</a>read the comments at the very top

 eulerscheZahl: no idea why i even reply after this aggressive opinion that I *have* to share. I can keep to myself whatever I want
 Astrobytes: You are indeed overly generous at times euler
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: let me thank you by inviting to my clash
 WINWINWIN: I dont understand how knowing the number of timeouts can be helpful
 Astrobytes: Knowing the number of timeouts means you can subtract that from your number of losses
 Astrobytes: So... useful knowledge no? Reasons why you lose matches? Do I timeout?
 WINWINWIN: So you can see how good the AI would be if you fix the bugs?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not about the number but the replays with timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: to find possible crashes when you don't handle a corner case
 Astrobytes: Well, it lets you know you *have* the bugs, and as euler says you can then analyse the games which timeout
 WINWINWIN: Ahh, so you can automate the "Search for timeouts" bit
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 WINWINWIN: so you can directly analyze the replays
 Astrobytes: Yes... that's what we've been talking about
 WINWINWIN: Thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: WINWINWIN, check out euler's playground:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 WINWINWIN: Thanks Astrobytes, am checking it now
 cegprakash: i need the no. of timeouts as well :D especially in oware 
 cegprakash: as I do higher depth with alpha beta pruning I just want my timeout chance to be as less as possible
 cegprakash: I don't do iterative deepening to constraint depth yet
 cegprakash: my timeout bot performs better than non timeout bots at instances
 Astrobytes: You can timeout with invalid moves also remember, not just run out of time
 eulerscheZahl: let's teach google some nonsense <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/rweeDp5">https://imgur.com/a/rweeDp5</a>
 jacek: mhm, with iterative deepening you are constrained with time, not depth
 cegprakash: yeah eulerscheZahl it sometimes asks me to choose bicycles whenn there is only 1 motorcycle
 cegprakash: jacek yes that's the advanntage of iterative deepeningn
 cegprakash: I need to learnn that soon
 eulerscheZahl: i like the "crosswalks" with text written on the lane
 cegprakash: but iterative deepening has a disadvantnage of usingn lot of memory and extra if connditionsn
 jacek: no&#160;:?
 cegprakash: I don't know why my keyboard is drunkk
 WINWINWIN: At the end of the playground, euler uses this
 WINWINWIN: #if DEBUG
 WINWINWIN: Why the #if instead of a regular if?
 eulerscheZahl: because i can define it in my IDE once. no need to chance a variable before submitting
 cegprakash: yeah iterative deepening we need to remember all the game states at previous depth
 Astrobytes: it's a preprocessor directive
 WINWINWIN: Ok, thanks
 cegprakash: along with all the gamestates in current branch
 eulerscheZahl: and i avoid a runtime branching which is faster. but really doesn't matter if it's only once per turn
 cegprakash: that's too much memory right jacek?
 eulerscheZahl: you run minimax with a fixed depth of 4 e.g.
 eulerscheZahl: then you see that you have time remaining and start from scratch with depth 6
 eulerscheZahl: and increase the depth until you run out of time
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to remember the tree, you just recompute it
 Astrobytes: "remember all the game states at previous depth" How do you come to that conclusion?
 eulerscheZahl: the tree size explodes anyways. you don't save much by saving the tree. and pruning can change when you increase the depth
 Astrobytes: You can store moves and scores, don't store gamestates
 cegprakash: ppl talk about transposition tables and u say recalculate everything eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: You don't store the whole state in a TT
 jacek: cegprakash it is really just adding for loop for you alphabeta
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50f3110f-3150-4c15-9799-5acfbb4168cc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50f3110f-3150-4c15-9799-5acfbb4168cc</a>
 jacek: TT and stuff is optional
 cegprakash: jacek this looks slow... 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you don't always need TTs and stuff, like we said the other day it's game-dependent
 cegprakash: why do u recompute everything
 cegprakash: say if u get a depth of 14 without recomputation u would reach depth of 15
 cegprakash: which is lot better 
 cegprakash: that's the true iterative deepening
 cegprakash: use the existing result
 jacek: it looks slow at first glance
 eulerscheZahl: then use your previous run for move ordering to speed it up, whatever
 jacek: but the result of the biggest depth will dominate anyway
 eulerscheZahl: the most time is spent in the last run anyways
 Astrobytes: Dude, I thought you'd understood when we explained all this the other day
 jacek: and he made his prune array :v
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76a0ea61-8d5d-4cff-b27a-a2054e38fed0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76a0ea61-8d5d-4cff-b27a-a2054e38fed0</a>
 cegprakash: what is prune array
 eulerscheZahl: the first number after the time is the depth i used for this iteration
 ZarthaxX: lol eulerscheZahl that crosswalk
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 cegprakash: it enver happened
 cegprakash: never*
 ZarthaxX: didnt you mark arrows?
 eulerscheZahl: would go there 10/10
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Astrobytes: lol
 cegprakash: I know no prune array
 Astrobytes: ceg is using the Magical Disappearing Stream STrategy
 ZarthaxX: LMAO
 cegprakash: I saw something similar to my prune array in smitsimax 
 cegprakash: not sure if he meant that
 Astrobytes: Where, exactly, in the Smitsi page did you see anything remotely like The Prune Array?
 eulerscheZahl: my English teacher always told us that we have to read between the lines
 eulerscheZahl: I got an E that year. luckily the teacher changed again after half a year
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: its easier to read while looking at the lines, not between them
 Scarfield: :p
 eulerscheZahl: "and till next week you'll learn these 2 DIN A3 pages of vocabulary. and that's not much"
 Astrobytes: Hey cegprakash, try using these next time:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/iaFvAsL">https://imgur.com/iaFvAsL</a>
 Astrobytes: Just line them up in a straight line
 Astrobytes: afk
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Scarfield: how to choose alpha and beta prune here?
 Scarfield: :thinking:
 cegprakash: "The exploration and expansion will focus on interesting parts of the tree and you can get much deeper than you would expect. "
 cegprakash: is it a food Astrobytes?
 Scarfield: The only thing i remember Smitsi mentioning pruning about is avoid expanding some series of moves
 cegprakash: what is UCB formula?
 MSmits: hey
 Scarfield: Upper Confidence Bound from MCTS
 Scarfield: hi
 MSmits: yeah, pruning is always good. Prune at least the branches you know to be useless and if some branches are almost never good, prune them too
 cegprakash: see.. smitsimax was developed with cegimax's idea
 MSmits: I think for many games the pruning is where the real difference between bots is
 cegprakash: but smitsimax came first
 Scarfield: he is not doing smitsimax, something about a pruning array, but i dont now what they were talking about though, something with alpha/beta negamax
 MSmits: what is cegimax
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: to me it sounds like a cigarette brand
 MSmits: :P
 cegprakash: u must have heard of orderMoves in negamax..
 MSmits: sure
 cegprakash: just pick the first few moves after orderingn
 cegprakash: that's cegimax
 MSmits: thats not really anything new is it?
 eulerscheZahl: more like drugs. you won't pass the doping test and will be disqualified. cegimax is too strong
 cegprakash: it could work for CSB I think.. especially with opponents who are greedy
 cegprakash: and opponents who don't do minimax
 MSmits: but if you're ordering, what are you ordering by?
 cegprakash: my eval
 MSmits: isn't this just beamsearch?
 cegprakash: wait there is a beam search?
 cegprakash: why does everyone invent search
 cegprakash: who is beam
 MSmits: beamsearch is when you only keep the x best moves
 Scarfield: Mr. Beam
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I've only ever used beamsearch in the context of 1p optimization though
 cegprakash: but I don't always keep x best moves
 cegprakash: x is a variable in cegimax
 cegprakash: based on depth
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: well stuff like that can work I suppose, kind of hinges on the quality of your eval though, as such things usually do
 cegprakash: yeah it's only good against greedy bots
 Astrobytes: MSmits, just sorting moves once per turn by eval before minimaxing to maximise pruning
 cegprakash: not safe bots like minimax
 Astrobytes: a/b pruning
 MSmits: once per turn?
 Astrobytes: yeah, just before you try all your moves. Not actual move ordering
 MSmits: cegprakash if it only works against greedy bots, it doesnt really work
 cegprakash: haha yeah 
 cegprakash: cegimax performed so bad on Oware Abapa
 MSmits: aha
 cegprakash: when my future moves are tightly dependent on opponents move it's better to play a safe move
 cegprakash: I mean we don't know opponent is greedy right
 MSmits: dunno what's a safe move in oware
 cegprakash: he can even sacrifice too
 cegprakash: say u play a game of chess
 MSmits: I don't really... but sure
 cegprakash: and u don't expect a queenn sacrifice
 cegprakash: coz it's a bad path for opponnent
 MSmits: right
 cegprakash: but he does queen sacrifice and win the game
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: because you used cegimax?
 cegprakash: yeah
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 cegprakash: many ppl did queen sacrifice kinda move on oware
 MSmits: the moral of that story was not to use cegimax right?
 Astrobytes: I think so?!
 cegprakash: on oware abapa yes
 MSmits: and chess?
 cegprakash: not on chess
 cegprakash: yes
 Astrobytes: Any game really
 cegprakash: I will try on CSB
 MSmits: allright then
 cegprakash:&#160;:@&#160;:@
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: have you tried toadymediocre on Oware?
 MSmits: the more bad things you tell me not to do, the more good things remain
 Astrobytes: I have a free Troll Pass cegprakash remember
 MSmits: toadymediocre? How's that perform?
 eulerscheZahl: mediocre
 Astrobytes: I thought it was toadallymediocre
 MSmits: mmh wouldn't have guessed
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: I think I finally made my mcts solver do some kind of ab pruning in regards to draws
 MSmits: seems to solve 4 plies sooner
 MSmits: on draws that is
 MSmits: it's a mess of a function, so i am not sure if it is bugged
 MSmits: basically, if a parent has a child A that is a draw and child B has a child that is a draw, then i don't have to explore the rest of child B because it is useless
 eulerscheZahl: you are about to write a wall of text again :scream:
 MSmits: no thats it
 MSmits: I'm done :P
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 Astrobytes: Makes sense
 MSmits: my problem was with meta mcts that it went into "draw hell" solving 47-50 plies deep sometimes on uttt. Now I think it can end at 40. Makes it easier to create opening books. \
 ArianPunk: guys, can we add extensions for CG's VSCode?
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: you mean the IDE?
 ArianPunk: yeah
 MSmits: is it vs code??
 ArianPunk: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: it's Monaco
 Astrobytes: It's Mona.. .ffs
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 ArianPunk: so similar to vscode
 MSmits: i am guessing vs code uses monaco....
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i didn't read the username at first
 eulerscheZahl: it's you again
 MSmits: who again?
 ArianPunk: so?
 Astrobytes: Him again MSmits
 MSmits: you mean that Punk?
 Astrobytes: lol yeah
 Astrobytes: Ask him if he feels lucky
 MSmits: ArianPunk, do you feel lucky, punk?
 ArianPunk: Be polite
 Astrobytes: lmao
 MSmits: I'm sharing movie quotes&#160;:(
 ArianPunk: :D
 Astrobytes: Well do ya, punk?
 Scarfield: 3 people here, me, Smith and Wesson
 Astrobytes: That should be me, Smits and Wesson just for this occasion
 Scarfield: true
 Scarfield: or me Smits and WestroBytes
 eulerscheZahl: westicle s
 trictrac: Hello all, 9 approvals for yinsh and not public&#160;: struct bad luck&#160;!!
 Astrobytes: Nice Scarfogen :D
 eulerscheZahl: i only approved out of curiosity :D
 MSmits: I thought he only needs 3?
 Scarfield: only lvl20+ can approve, else its upvote iirc
 MSmits: ohh
 Astrobytes: yeah, there's something up with the approval
 MSmits: it needs me?
 eulerscheZahl: CG has a bug
 eulerscheZahl: but sure, approve it
 Scarfield: oh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507278f09e87a7502889c884cb59a49ca02b">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507278f09e87a7502889c884cb59a49ca02b</a>
 Scarfield: i need my bribe first :p
 eulerscheZahl: let's see how often we can approve without releasing it
 Scarfield: i only see 2 approvals?
 eulerscheZahl: then become #3
 eulerscheZahl: click "approve"
 Astrobytes: Tried. Still not working
 Scarfield: i havent even looked at it, at least i played with SR before approving :pp
 Astrobytes: btw, looks like IAmNoob changed his name
 wlesavo: what it is now?
 wlesavo: IAmPro?
 Astrobytes: Check the profile under my approval comment on Yinsh
 Scarfield: "A contribution by structApproved by ..." then 23 users :D
 Astrobytes: Or here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/9429b8d2c53631cad82d5e4c4741c7496584773">https://www.codingame.com/profile/9429b8d2c53631cad82d5e4c4741c7496584773</a>
 WINWINWIN: Lol struct, you cant approve it yourself :P
 WINWINWIN:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no one can approve the own contribution
 eulerscheZahl: that's the point of the review process
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, makes sense
 wlesavo: Astrobytes oh yeah, i forgot he had a bunch of contribs, easy to track from there
 WINWINWIN: but I liked Yinsh seemed pretty interesting
 eulerscheZahl: but you can upvote your own contriubtions and comments
 WINWINWIN: What is the point of that?
 Astrobytes: Yeah that too wlesavo&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: infinite XP
 wlesavo: thats how one get lvl 52 :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: in infinite time...
 WINWINWIN: Hmm :smiling_imp:
 eulerscheZahl: that's why you get more XP than me but only lvl50
 WINWINWIN: @wlesavo finally get what you mean, find it hard to believe that he got to top 500 in 2 multis in a single day
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html</a>
 MSmits: that's actually possible. Top 500 in 2 multis
 MSmits: especially with community multis. Just submit the stub
 wlesavo: lol
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) MSmits I meant difficult multis like Code royale
 wlesavo: easy top 500 in tulips
 WINWINWIN: Top 100 even
 eulerscheZahl: i think i could reach gold in 1 afternoon on most multiplayer games. that alone isn't a cheating indicator
 WINWINWIN: I thought that was only possible if you did a similar multi before
 Astrobytes: Identical bots and screenshots however... they most definitely are :P
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, these are great indicators
 WINWINWIN: otherwise, you need to read and understand the rules, formulate a strategy, and debug it
 MSmits: who are we talking about btw
 WINWINWIN: Seems like it takes more than 1 -- 2 hours
 eulerscheZahl: the promotion time alone is &gt; 1-2h in some cases
 WINWINWIN: python programmer guy
 Astrobytes: IAmNoob MSmits, who now goes under a new name
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: programera mix of programmer and pro-gamer
 Scarfield: lol he actually was cheating? saw someone bugging him about it the other day
 Astrobytes: Ohhh yes
 ZarthaxX: that was the astrobully
 WINWINWIN: Yes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Shush WeakhaxX
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Scarfield: banter from A to Z 
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Alphabanter from the banterbet
 wlesavo: well not really bugging, most of that was him saiyng iamnotacheater in a walls of messages
 Astrobytes: ^
 Scarfield: read that as IAmNoTeacher.. didnt make sense :p
 eulerscheZahl: same Scarfield :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 ZarthaxX: the Astrobuster got the cheater this time
 wlesavo: thats what MSmits would say
 eulerscheZahl: can you still call him a teacher when he isn't in front of his class? :P
 Astrobytes: Meta-teacher
 Astrobytes: lol Zarthuum
 MSmits: hey, I will be in front of my class on tuesday
 eulerscheZahl: and Friday
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: dont remember everything I say
 Scarfield: nice
 MSmits: it's creepy
 eulerscheZahl: do you still remember the names of your students?
 Astrobytes: We have a chat log now remember
 wlesavo: especially when you a teacher
 MSmits: oh euler studies the chat log?
 eulerscheZahl: i was here when you mentioned it
 Astrobytes: Only for your messages :smirk:
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i remember most of them, not all
 MSmits: I know eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: but you remember everything
 MSmits: I forget stuff people say and then they point that out to me
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/Dd7FixvoKBw?t=17">https://youtu.be/Dd7FixvoKBw?t=17</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and I had some fun with the logs yesterday, see the very bottom<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-26">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-26</a>
 Scarfield: dont be that guy on monday smitsi :p
 MSmits: whats that guy?
 Scarfield: my link
 Scarfield: rudely interrupted by euler :p
 eulerscheZahl: sorry
 Astrobytes: LOL Scarfondant
 Astrobytes: that's funny
 Scarfield: say one hail mary and all your sins will be forgiven :p
 MSmits: lol eulerscheZahl, you're messing up the html of the chat log?
 Scarfield: yea its a classic&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: with the wiki syntax
 eulerscheZahl: once i was sitting in physics class. teacher showed us a gas pump and wanted to highlight a certain part of it
 Scarfield: that nick though lol
 eulerscheZahl: moved his finger over it, breaking the glass in 2 parts
 eulerscheZahl: one hit the student in the first row on his head, started bleeding immediately
 eulerscheZahl: dropping on the floor as he was leaning forwards
 eulerscheZahl: teacher told him not to bleed on the floor :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Scarfield: lol yea how rude of him
 eulerscheZahl: ambulance drove him to the hospital that day
 Astrobytes: My chemistry teacher in 3rd year of highschool set fire to the ceiling and the bench with some hydrocarbon experiment
 eulerscheZahl: classic
 eulerscheZahl: chemistry teacher of mine explained us that he has to hurry with the phosphor. starts cutting off a part. was old and flew away
 eulerscheZahl: while he was searching, the rest of it caught fire
 eulerscheZahl: we ended the lesson in a different classroom
 Astrobytes: hahahaha that's awesome
 MSmits: I have a couple stories like that as well. My chemistry teacher. Did the H2 explosion experiment
 MSmits: which is pretty standard
 MSmits: what's not standard is that he left the classroom because "he didn't do well with loud noises"
 MSmits: while we were waiting for it to go off
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: the lid of the box he exploded landed on my table
 eulerscheZahl: and in elementary school we were sitting in the classroom. someone from outside opened the door and  closed it again with a loud bang
 Astrobytes: My 1st year science (general science) teacher (who became my biology teacher) did the sodium in water 'experiment'. Had a massive water bath outside. Cut off a piece of sodium the size of a chess rook and chucked it in. We had to run. There was no water bath remaining. Was awesome :D
 MSmits: after a few classes there was this other guy in the classroom who was really just an assistent lab guy... but we thought the school leadership hired him to keep an eye on our teacher
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits :D
 eulerscheZahl: one of my classmates wanted to demonstrate it to another teacher. repeated it and suddenly hold the door handle is his hands. we were locked inside the room
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: We once ruined some teachers lab coats using high molarity H2SO4, had to sneak into the lab tech's storeroom and everything. Was great when the coats just fell apart.
 MSmits: ouch 
 Astrobytes: (they weren't exactly what you call 'high'grade' lab coats)
 MSmits: that would get you expelled for sure in our school. They love their lab coats
 MSmits: as a teacher I made a dent in the ceiling once
 AntiSquid: oh i remember the many occurrences no where no teacher showed up for class, and then when students started leaving early because of it, the school directing asshole came in to mark attendance 
 Astrobytes: We used to steal Büchner flasks and sell them to the stoners to make bongs from
 Scarfield: lol
 Emmaka9: Hey guys, I'm Emeka, I'm new here.:slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: hello new here
 Scarfield: hi
 Scarfield: HashtroBytes
 AntiSquid: also your name says Emmaka, why do you pretend your name is Emeka&#160;?
 MSmits: I did an experiment with an aluminum ring around a coil and you suddenly turn on the current, causing induction in the ring which forces it to go up. Some student suggested to extend  the iron core to see if it would have more effect. The dent is still in the ceiling today
 Astrobytes: lol Weedfield
 Scarfield: xD
 Emmaka9: Can you guys help me get familiar with this platform?
 Astrobytes: That's great MSmits :D
 AntiSquid: MSmits that reminds me of&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdYueB9pY4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdYueB9pY4</a>
 MSmits: I also did an experiment with fluid pressure using the gas lines as counter pressure. But there was some extra pressure on it and the green colored water jumped out of the other end all over me
 Emmaka9: btw why are you guys talking about chemistry?
 MSmits: luckily it washed out, but i did have to teach green the rest of the day
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Jasperr: Emmaka9 start with the easy puzzles in Practice &gt; Easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: Emmaka9 the conversation just started from talking about teachers
 MSmits: we were talking about our own teachers and I am one, so I have stories from both ends :P
 Emmaka9: oh
 Jasperr: Haha my mom is a teacher, makes for great dinner stories&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so you have more stories in total&#160;:)
 MSmits: definitely
 MSmits: a colleague of mine was doing experiments with liquid nitrogen
 MSmits: people that do that, tend to throw it around and watch it turn to smoke
 MSmits: but my colleague just let it flow out of the can in one place
 MSmits: the floor covering froze, cooled and tore
 MSmits: oops
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: How much area did he destroy?
 MSmits: small area
 MSmits: but you can still see it
 Astrobytes: Awesome
 eulerscheZahl: my teacher just put roses in it and them broke them like glass
 AntiSquid: ugh good he didn't drop it on his shoes
 MSmits: yeah i did that too
 MSmits: I had a colleague who picked up a lot of liquid nitrogen from the university where he also worked and we got to play with it
 Astrobytes: My pipette fights with my classmates seem lame in comparison. We used aqueous ammonia usually. Go around stinking of ammonia all day if you got hit.
 MSmits: I one time slurped a lot of H2O2 whatever that is called, by sucking too hard on the thing
 Astrobytes: You wouldn't know as it was silent. Unless it hit your skin.
 Astrobytes: Hydrogen peroxide, yummy!
 eulerscheZahl: i got some H2O2 on my finger once. teacher spilled a bit and i wasn't paying attention for a second and touched it
 MSmits: thats not bad is it?
 MSmits: not sure what it does
 eulerscheZahl: my skin turned white instantly
 AntiSquid: i guess i had the most unexciting chemistry classes then, most "sensational" was teacher mixing backing power and lemon juice together
 eulerscheZahl: it's a bleach
 MSmits: seriously? I must be very white on the inside then
 Astrobytes: It's a strong oxidiser MSmits
 Astrobytes: CAn be very nasty at high molarity
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: I had a fellow student once that exclaimed: "These thermometers are crap, they aren't even set to 0 when you're not using them"
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: he was serious about it
 Scarfield: xD
 Alshock: I like that idea
 AntiSquid: isn't that the teacher's fault failing to explain how they work?
 MSmits: might be, it's funny either way
 eulerscheZahl: you can assume common sense
 Scarfield: everything is relative, except those damn thermometeres
 AntiSquid: common sense, well depends, electric one can just be turned off 
 Astrobytes: I farted once in biology, and thestools were wooden so you can imagine it wasn't quiet. My teacher came offer and put a rubber bung on my desk and recommended I use it :D
 Astrobytes: *over
 Scarfield: rubber bung?
 Astrobytes: rubber stopper
 Astrobytes: like for a flask
 Scarfield: oh ah lol xD
 AntiSquid: humblebrag&#160;?
 Alshock: AntiSquid next class the teacher was hit by a rubber at high speed, followed by a noticeable scent
 Astrobytes: I should point out that the rubber stopper remained on my desk.
 Alshock: You mean you sat on your desk for the rest of the class?
 Scarfield: you should have used it, not like the teacher could stop you after recommending it 
 Alshock: :D Sorry I'm out :door:
 Astrobytes: lol :D
 AntiSquid: well there was a story about a student getting disciplined for fapping in class ... his crush (the teacher) caught him in the act
 Astrobytes: Yeah, a few of those 'incidents' in our school too. Better than the kid in primary school who dropped a steamer on the centre spot of the football field. (We called him Bobby the Jobby forever - he wasn't right in the head)
 Alshock: Now I imagine a mix of disciplinary class, and lots of rubber stoppers
 Astrobytes: I will not imagine that.
 AntiSquid: my school was fucked up
 AntiSquid: in a really bad way
 Astrobytes: We had a music teacher who slept with a pupil (of legal age but still), numerous affairs, serious assaults, drugs, alcohol related issues (teachers and pupils)
 Astrobytes: Was never a dull moment.
 AntiSquid: ah had something similar too i guess, some former uni teacher who slept with students (for whatever underlying reason) got kicked out and then joined my school since he couldn't get a uni job afterwards 
 Astrobytes: lol, there's a lot of it about
 AntiSquid: that's the mild stuff
 Astrobytes: Grew up in a rough town as well AntiSquid I guess? 
 AntiSquid: wouldn't call it rough if that's the norm
 Astrobytes: My town (in which I'm currently living) is and always has been a violent cesspit of junkies, drunks and all-round nasty fkers.
 Astrobytes: It's a hole and should be erased from existence.
 MSmits: have you thought about becoming a realtor?
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: I just mean, you do such a great job of selling it :P
 Astrobytes: I mean there are a few nice streets and small areas so there are upsides - but in the scale of the town, that makes no difference.
 AntiSquid: you get oddities in every town, but in some towns / countries it's pretty much standard
 Astrobytes: Yea I know MSmits :P
 MSmits: so the normal places are the hidden back alleys?
 Astrobytes: This is one of those towns AntiSquid, there's a lot of it in Scotland. A LOT.
 MSmits: hey, so, about Scotland
 MSmits: are you still forced to let in strangers if they need to pee?
 Astrobytes: Eh?
 MSmits: isnt that a law
 AntiSquid: lol
 MSmits: maybe i am mixing up different countries here
 Astrobytes: First I heard of it
 MSmits: let me check
 MSmits: google: scotland law pee
 Astrobytes: It's true  :o
 AntiSquid: well MSmits let me know when you visit scotland, because i have an urge to go visit people i know from chat in the middle of the night, so make sure you open the door, it's the law
 Astrobytes: Fuck that
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: yes, see now you learned something about your country from me
 MSmits: lol AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: Our national animal is a unicorn and we need to let strangers in for a Jimmy Riddle, whatever next
 AntiSquid: ok well if it's true, let me know the hotel you stay at, need to take a piss in your toilet
 MSmits: see my memory is quite good when it comes to some things
 AntiSquid: ya 
 AntiSquid: :thinking: those sort of things
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Useless things. I have a friend like that. Can't remember anything except movie quotes
 MSmits: those are the best friends to have
 AntiSquid: does he learn anything from them?
 Astrobytes: No. And they're usually obscure. He's a chef :shrug:
 Astrobytes: afk
 MSmits: food related quotes?
 AntiSquid: he said movie quotes
 MSmits: yes, but obscure, so movie and food both
 CaillouBOB: yo
 AntiSquid: do you think about your job outside your job MSmits&#160;?
 CaillouBOB: i think not
 MSmits: my job and private life are a bit intertwined because i work a lot from home
 MSmits: about 50% even without corona
 AntiSquid: it's not something you want to think about if it stresses you all day
 MSmits: when you're starting out, teaching stresses you. Unless you're crap at it, the stress goes away most of the time
 MSmits: sometimes i have to do too much work in a short period of time due to unlucky deadlines, but thats pretty rare
 MSmits: also i work only 30 hrs a week
 Astrobytes: back
 MSmits: (as in part time job, i am not slacking off)
 Astrobytes: My friend is Swedish so often thinks about cheffing outside of work 
 MSmits: is this a Swedish thing?
 Astrobytes: Swedish Chef, the Muppets...
 MSmits: ow right, i sort of half got that reference, wasnt sure
 AntiSquid: do you ever think about going back Astrobytes&#160;?
 AntiSquid: to cheffing
 Astrobytes: I have over the years but I think I'm done with it for now. I miss the  adrenaline and the camaraderie sometimes. 
 AntiSquid: i don't miss anything, that shit is retarded and underpaid for the amount of stress
 AntiSquid: seeing fucking whales in offices doing nothing and getting paid a lot more kinda pisses me off
 MSmits: whales?
 Astrobytes: Nothing quite like the buzz of a busy service.Yeah, there's that. But a lot of us weren't doing it for the money (well, obviously needed it but we we passionate)
 AntiSquid: talking about "administrative" jobs
 Astrobytes: *were
 AntiSquid: what a joke
 WINWINWIN: Now that online classes have started, my classmates have a lot more interesting ways of coming to class
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/8nKFuZC">https://imgur.com/a/8nKFuZC</a>
 MSmits: does this depend on the quality of the restaurant you're cheffing at?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, once I moved to office-based stuff I felt similarly AntiSquid
 MSmits: I would guess the better restaurants pay their chefs better?
 AntiSquid: it's generally lower paid jobs MSmits
 Astrobytes: You'd be surprised MSmits
 MSmits: hm ok
 AntiSquid: at a better restaurant you just put in more work lol
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: Even a lot of head chef positions aren't high-paying
 MSmits: whats the difference between a head chef and a chef?
 Astrobytes: Head Chef is in charge
 MSmits: I thought the chef was
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: In strict definition yes
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes you talk about adrenaline and all that, i get what you are thinking about, but if you analyze it more carefully you realize, what you really want is to have your own place and have a bunch of staff handle the rough bits
 Astrobytes: And in the US for example Chef = HEad/Executive chef, cook = chef
 Astrobytes: Yeah chef/proprietor would be nice
 Astrobytes: I had 2 head chef positions and worked my fking ass off
 AntiSquid: MSmits emphazis on "head", they make sure to schedule shifts, find covers when someone calls off sick every tuesday and friday night, ensure there's enough stock (food), manages kitchen budget, disputes between staff
 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: basically you need to be the kitchen manage and a chef (but with higher caliber too)
 MSmits: disputes between people with knives = bad
 AntiSquid: uhm it's not like that usually
 MSmits: nah, I'm sure it's usually just accidental
 AbundantPuddle: I positioned two chef's heads in my ass and that worked.
 Astrobytes: Don't. We had a religious extremist guy who started chucking knives at waitresses as they were showing themselfves in the kitchen
 kovi: recurse strikes back
 AntiSquid: though i remember one of my colleagues at a pub had a dent in one of his shoulder blades from a knife
 MSmits: where's he striking kovi
 Astrobytes: Took the whole kitchen to hold him down until the police came
 kovi: sr
 MSmits: sounds nasty Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: It wasn't fun
 MSmits: i forgot what sr was
 kovi: search race
 AbundantPuddle: I didn't know kitchens had arms. Interesting.
 MSmits: oh the new racing
 AntiSquid: oh those weirdos, wonder why they applied in the first place, also "can't serve pork products" rofl Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hahaha AbundantPuddle
 Astrobytes: "The whole brigade" :P
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao.
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid yeah, tbh most of the guys were fine w/ pork because it was their job, but you always get one...
 Emmaka9: just a quick question, not to be offensive or anything - are you guys enjoying this chat? because I guess none of you know each other, right?
 AbundantPuddle: I worked in restaurants a good portion of my working career. Never again.
 AntiSquid: good for you
 Astrobytes: It becomes a lifestyle, not a job
 Astrobytes: Emmaka9 most of us are regulars here
 MSmits: Emmaka9 we are coding a lot in between chatting
 MSmits: well some of us
 Astrobytes: Yep
 AntiSquid: Emmaka9 you sound a bit ... introverted
 jacek: i like trolling in the chat, so i enjoy it
 Emmaka9: ok, got it
 AntiSquid: like i care if know these people or not
 AntiSquid: i don't really know most people i talk to in my daily life can still have a conversation
 Emmaka9: yeah, I'm a bit introverted, and I thought its  normal for CS people ...
 MSmits: it seems more common
 jacek: im better at chatting than talking
 AbundantPuddle: I don't know where you all are from, but in America, the restaurant industry will just use and abuse you. No benefits, high stress level and low pay, unless you happen to be one of the very few lucky people who have made it to restaurant fame in some way, shape, or form.
 AntiSquid: the definition of "CS people" is a bit ambiguous 
 Astrobytes: Same everywhere I think AbundantPuddle
 MSmits: because CS = counterstrike?
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: i knew someone who worked for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, he explained very clearly how everyone is treated like dirt AbundantPuddle
 Astrobytes: I stole 2 of his KPs :D
 AbundantPuddle: I had a buddy who went to culinary school a while back because he loved cooking. He was executive chef for a number of years. Now he drives for Uber and is going back to school for automechanics.
 Emmaka9: just meant to say coder (CS = Computer Science)
 MSmits: yeah we got it Emmaka9&#160;:)
 reCurse: No we don't enjoy this chat at all
 Astrobytes: We know Emmaka9&#160;;)
 reCurse: The hatred is what powers us to keep talking
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: reCurse goes here to get frustrated at people and then disappears to code some awesome bot to whack people with
 jacek: yeah, hows uttt?
 Emmaka9: btw how to mention someone here&#160;?
 AbundantPuddle: It is true. The restaurant industry is probably the worst industry to work in. It is definitely the worst industry that I've personally worked for. And I've worked in a lot of industries. Lol.
 jacek: Emmaka9
 Astrobytes: Just type their name Emmaka9
 MSmits: type part of their name, finish with tab key, you will make the message appear red
 AntiSquid: most of the CS guys left since they stuck in wood Emmaka9, that' how things work here
 Emmaka9: AntiSquid "This is a test" :grin:
 Scarfield: icles
 Astrobytes: Test failed. Time limit exceeded.
 AbundantPuddle: Can we Abbreviate "CS guys" even further to CS:G?
 Astrobytes: or just CSG... 
 AbundantPuddle: That's no fun.
 Scarfield: CSBG?
 AbundantPuddle: Need to get as close to trademark infringement as possible.
 Astrobytes: well, as Scarface there pointed out, it's very close to CSB
 AbundantPuddle: CS:BG
 Emmaka9: can I try to know you guys? like what do you guys do? professional coder or student?
 MSmits: all kinds here
 AntiSquid: sure
 AbundantPuddle: Professional Troll
 AntiSquid: get an avatar Emmaka9
 muy31: high school student
 AntiSquid: anime avatars are superior
 MSmits: coder, student, teacher, ex-chef 
 muy31: true AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: 2 ex-chefs
 AntiSquid: and what are you doing Emmaka9&#160;?
 AbundantPuddle: AntiSquid is an Octopus
 Emmaka9: cs undergrad - juniior year
 AbundantPuddle: He just wears sunglasses
 Astrobytes: I work in conservation and pharmaceutical regulatory affairs
 MSmits: Emmaka9 a lot of fun things to do here for you then
 Emmaka9: MSmits yeah, can already feel it
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/rS0FOLT">https://imgur.com/a/rS0FOLT</a> AbundantPuddle
 jacek: aww
 Emmaka9: MSmits btw how so?
 Emmaka9: like what?
 jacek: puzzles, games bots
 AbundantPuddle: AntiSquid, but why is it on a motorcycle? :joy:
 Astrobytes: Programming bots for games, puzzles
 AntiSquid: i work at a morgue, we had a lot of fresh junior students shipped in lately Emmaka9
 muy31: it not an it
 Astrobytes: ffs AntiSquid :P
 AbundantPuddle: To learn about morgue stuff, I assune.
 AbundantPuddle: *assume
 AntiSquid: just a squeamish test
 AntiSquid: or squeamishness&#160;? 
 CaillouBOB: deezy
 Astrobytes: The latter AntiSquid
 Emmaka9: AntiSquid what do mean by "a lot of fresh junior students shipped in lately"&#160;?
 Scarfield: claimed to work at a morgue also, it was a joke&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: Has anybody else had chat problems where sometimes the text doesn't send properly? Ironically, my first attempt at sending that didn't work.
 AntiSquid: ah that's the riddle of life Emmaka9
 AntiSquid: pun intended
 Emmaka9: got it :upside_down:
 AbundantPuddle: City morgue, you bag em, we tag em.
 AbundantPuddle: City morgue, you kill em, we grill em.
 Astrobytes: *City café
 AbundantPuddle: Oh geeze Astrobytes... I don't envy you then.
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: just to clarify, squid can refer to careless idiot motorbiker too btw AbundantPuddle
 AbundantPuddle: I know AntiSquid. That was part of the joke. Lol.
 AntiSquid: grill what? the rats?
 muy31: the squids
 AntiSquid: they do it themselves
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: remember that one time being stuck on a highway for hours,
 muy31: ccalamari
 AbundantPuddle: 50 quid for grilled squids?
 muy31: *calamari
 AbundantPuddle: No, keep the stutter muy31.
 AntiSquid: after like 4 hours we get past a truck that had potatoes spilled all over the ground and what seemed to be like burnt fuel on the ground?
 Astrobytes: Was gonna say 'c', the letter so nice you say it twice
 AntiSquid: basically roast dinner in open air
 AbundantPuddle: Was therte any roadkill nearby?
 AbundantPuddle: *there
 AntiSquid: no, don't think so
 AbundantPuddle: Shame
 AbundantPuddle: Coulda had some Possum and Potatoes
 AntiSquid: prefer a bamby
 AntiSquid: bambi *
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/p_bambi_digitalhd_1f041240.png">https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/p_bambi_digitalhd_1f041240.png</a> looks deliciously cute
 AbundantPuddle: Venison and veggies
 AbundantPuddle: Too far?
 Astrobytes: Chat goes quiet when we code
 AbundantPuddle: Isn't that a song by Skrillex?
 Astrobytes: Skrillex sucks. Nice fella though.
 AbundantPuddle: I disagree. He's definitely way over-hyped, but the dude does have some skills.
 AntiSquid: i don't code, try to find motivation to sort out a huge mess which others call a bot
 Astrobytes: I'm a DnB head, he basically started off making what we call wobble/clownstep jumpup brostep. Went downhill from there. Good production skills? 100% yes.
 AbundantPuddle: Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?
 AbundantPuddle: He actually started off in screamo. He was in From First to Last before he started his Skrillex project. The underground always hates on people who go mainstream. I do think Skrillex is way over-hyped, but as a musician myself, I do have a respect and can recognize his talent. That's just my opinion though. Music is very subjective.
 Astrobytes: No I appreciate that. I was referring to his electronic career. I also make music (not currently, studio is packed away in other room). That's why I agree he's a great producer, he has excellent production skills, always has.
 Astrobytes: What do you play/make AbundantPuddle?
 Emmaka9: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5e6566c-0d7b-41a6-b7af-366e7f3d9bfd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5e6566c-0d7b-41a6-b7af-366e7f3d9bfd</a>
 AntiSquid: aneo&#160;? click Forum button
 Emmaka9: thanks
 AntiSquid: more like a long list of complete spoilers, but w/e
 AbundantPuddle: Well I can sight read for trumpet and french horn, but I also play guitar/bass, drums, piano/keyboard, as well as use DAWs.
 AbundantPuddle: As far as genres go, I try not to limit myself as to what I listen to or make, but I've always considered myself more of a metalhead than anything.
 Astrobytes: Awesome stuff AbundantPuddle! I can't play any wind/brass, but I play guitar, bass, 5-string banjo, mandolin and keys. I use Cubase, got loads of hardware, but as I say not currently doing anything except gathering dust
 Astrobytes: I'm into all sorts too (metal included)
 Uljahn: i play uTTT instead of bass now&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i play youtube 
 AbundantPuddle: That's awesome! I've always wanted to try banjo and mandolin. Mandolin is a staple for a lot of Greek music and my grandfather used to play it. Side-note, I've tried violin and am absolutely terrible. I can't do the bow with string instruments.
 eulerscheZahl: i play no internet connection
 eulerscheZahl: the chrome dinosaur game
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao squid and euler.
 AntiSquid: you have a bot for it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Mandolin and bouzouki ofc AbundantPuddle!
 Astrobytes: Here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/KLPDyvz">https://imgur.com/a/KLPDyvz</a>
 AbundantPuddle: Is that your gear?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Uljahn: holy moly
 Astrobytes: You can see the cat in my profile pic in the first photo
 Scarfield: heey, thats you in the chair
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: rusting away like a bunch of unused knives 
 AbundantPuddle: Hell yeah dude! Way more extensive than mine.
 Astrobytes: I've sold a few bits and pieces since but still got most of it
 AntiSquid: didn't spot your cat
 Astrobytes: In the chair
 Scarfield: but damn thats a lot of gear 
 AntiSquid: plottwist: Astro is that cat
 Astrobytes: The SH-101 really needs serviced but everything else works
 Astrobytes: Guitars are still all set up, but can't play anything with this back issue atm
 AbundantPuddle: Where's your keytar?
 Astrobytes: Actually, the SH-101 has a handle extension, you may have seen it being used like that in the 80s :D
 Astrobytes: Handle has modulation controls on it too, so you can pitch bend lol
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao. I knew it. Def the set-up of somebody who owns a keytar!
 AntiSquid: did you put any of your work out there on the web&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Only ever used it for basses and squealy acid stuff tbh
 Hjax: im messing around with code golf, how small people can get their solutions blows my mind
 reCurse: Wait until you see the solutions of tall people
 Hjax: :P
 Scarfield: xD
 Alshock: that's so mean to dwarves :P
 Alshock: aw I was too slow&#160;:(
 Hjax: im doing tricks to shave off one character at a time, but im like 50% larger than the best solution 
 Hjax: so my approach is probably wrong 
 AbundantPuddle: I actually do have a song I put together for a buddy's horror movie on youtube that I did somewhat recently.
 eulerscheZahl: which language Hjax?
 Alshock: the best solution in your language Hjax?
 Hjax: python 3, chuck norris
 Hjax: yes best solution in my language 
 eulerscheZahl: for some it's better to do it in bash and then a system call
 Astrobytes: Back in my software only days:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMsJu5lKimo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMsJu5lKimo</a>
 eulerscheZahl: not sure about python
 Astrobytes: Went a bit mad on the edits
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/">https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/</a> this helps with finding some extra shortening tips 
 AntiSquid: someone posted the thor question somewhere in there i think
 Hjax: doing it in bash and making a system call is kind of an amusing thought, i didnt consider that 
 eulerscheZahl: at some point it was even possible to wget your solution. but was fixed and online solutions removed from the leaderboard
 AbundantPuddle: I'm digging it Astro.
 eulerscheZahl: so it was about who can buy the shortest domain :D
 Astrobytes: Here's another:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMsJu5lKimo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMsJu5lKimo</a>
 Alshock: oh that's why they wantedshort urls then!
 Hjax: im surprised the container the scripts run in can access the internet at all 
 Hjax: seems like an obvious security issue 
 eulerscheZahl: only for one single codegolf puzzle, not for the others
 Alshock: because you thik it's in a container? :P
 eulerscheZahl: and not anymore, it's fixed
 eulerscheZahl: but tech.io still gives access to other websites
 AbundantPuddle: Ummm... Astrobytes... That was the same link. Lol.
 Astrobytes: And here's the last DnB tune I ever made AbundantPuddle, you'll like it being a metalhead<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-holuvgRgA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-holuvgRgA</a>

 AbundantPuddle: My chat is dead and broken.
 jacek: astrocytes?
 Astrobytes: Hard to believe this was so long ago
 Astrobytes: We played 'I Am Still Among You' as the last track of my mates set at Twisted Sessions @ Ubu in REnnes (France). Was fking insanity. Great feeling watching all these crazy pilled-up French DnB nutters losing it to your own tune
 AbundantPuddle: Def love the grungy hard-hitting bass!
 AbundantPuddle: I don't believe I'm familiar with the original, however.
 Astrobytes: Which one
 AbundantPuddle: I am still among you
 Astrobytes: My good mate Scott. We ran this little internet label for a couple years, along with DeeOne/DarkoneUK. Original:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTziON7TqtE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTziON7TqtE</a>
 Astrobytes: Me and Dee played pots and pans DnB mostly, Scott more jungle/tech
 Astrobytes: And here's Surveillance, from that EP (more pots and pans):<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hToRYfSxmN4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hToRYfSxmN4</a>
 Astrobytes: Meh, Jon should've stuck to his Spor stuff if you ask me :P
 Astrobytes: I liked all the Noisia stuff that wasn't DnB though. 
 Astrobytes: Because, Noisia
 AbundantPuddle: I just love the take on the old commercials. And then the giant line and gold nose. Epic.
 Astrobytes: Now, lemme get back to coding. I've never shared those to anyone other than DnB groups back in the day btw, so consider yourself unlucky
 RomainJava: This is so cool
 AntiSquid: "i'm still among you" - jesus reference? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: should i just make sure you read the first line of input
 Astrobytes: It's from one of the 'Saw' movies iirc
 AbundantPuddle: I do like Feed Me just as much as I like Spor. But yeah, I agree, time to code. Thanks for sharing. Lol.
 Scarfield: yea thanks for sharing&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: This chat thing irritates me. Does anybody else have chat problems?
 Scarfield: it lags sometimes? if that is what you mean
 AntiSquid: ah, sorry but that movie series was really dull, including the early ones
 Astrobytes: Not my sample. I only remixed it.
 AntiSquid: just gore + some villain with "moral lessons" about life
 Astrobytes: I agree.
 AntiSquid: and in about movie 7 or 8 (forgot how many there are) he basically broke his own moral code 
 Astrobytes: Don't think I got past 2
 AbundantPuddle: Not just lag. I can't type in chat sometimes and I have to open up CG in a new window.
 AntiSquid: forgot where exactly, but that one kill was going against everything he was preaching and just killed for the gore-thirsty audience
 Scarfield: hm i never had that issue, which browser?
 AbundantPuddle: Chrome
 Scarfield: weird, do you have a million tabs open or something?
 AbundantPuddle: It could also be because I have different instances of CG in different tabs.
 eulerscheZahl: or some addons?
 AntiSquid: it's ok Astrobytes you don't need to waste your life watching as many shitty movies as i did
 AntiSquid: a lot of them i watched at double speed btw :p
 AbundantPuddle: I do have addons. That could possibly be why.
 Scarfield: but there are good shitty movies, the room, arnold/stallone movies and so on&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: stallone movies aren't really shit
 AbundantPuddle: I actually liked the first Saw. The twist was really good. However, when you start expecting the twists, they become less "twisty."
 AntiSquid: the room was stupid imo ... i mean the premise of it
 Astrobytes: The 'torture porn' genre doesn't do much for me, Hostel and such. Just boring and mindless.I like gore with humour, like Braindead (Dead Alive)
 Scarfield: many of them are, but cop land and the first rambo are good movies
 AntiSquid: oh torture porn is good term for it ... 
 AntiSquid: asian horror movies (that i watched) were less about torture and more about the story though
 Astrobytes: Not my idea, 'saw' it used before and found it appropriate
 AntiSquid: well they have their fair share of silly blood and gore movies
 AbundantPuddle: The Evil Dead
 Astrobytes: ^ hell yeah
 Astrobytes: All 3
 Astrobytes: So ridiculous
 AbundantPuddle: Have you seen the new series too? Lol.
 Astrobytes: Never got around to it, was it decent?
 AbundantPuddle: I'm actually a big fan, but I agree 100%. They are extremely ridiculous.
 Astrobytes: I'm a huge fan of ridiculous horror like that&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: which series?
 Astrobytes: Evil Dead
 AbundantPuddle: I liked it. Did you know that Jason (from Friday the 13th) and Ash (The Evil Dead) are supposed to exist in the same universe.
 AntiSquid: you like ridiculous horror? watch jap horror, all about the blood fountains with every tiny cut and some cute girls doing random shit
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it got a bit crazy with the crossovers
 Astrobytes: Was my first head chef actually that got me into all the dodgy /comedy horrors
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, Jason is actually a deadite.
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Brain Damage, Basket Case, stuff like that too
 Astrobytes: Then you got Cannibal Ferox, Cannibal Holocaust (those can be considered early torture porn tho I guess, and have some unnecessary animal harming scenes)
 AbundantPuddle: I forget which Friday the 13th movie it was, but they had the Necronomicon as a nod to Evil Dead. They were supposed to do a crossover as well but I believe the project died. Probably evilly.
 Astrobytes: lol, dark forces prevented it
 Astrobytes: Anyway, ENOUGH. I must code
 Astrobytes: :D
 AbundantPuddle: Dead Alive
 Astrobytes: Yeah I mentioned it earlier, the uncut UK version is called Braindead
 AbundantPuddle: Oh, that's news to me. I'll have to look into that. Agreed, coding time.
 Astrobytes: And ofc, don't forget that other Peter Jackson classic, Bad Taste
 struct: Hello
 AbundantPuddle: Hi struct
 Astrobytes: Oh Illedan added the debug lines in SR, nice
 Illedan: Yeah, pushed 1 min ago&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I noticed :D
 Illedan: And Collision times are added to game summary
 Illedan: They are shown always
 Astrobytes: Cool, thanks&#160;:)
 Illedan: And you can get as input the latest collision with the debug message
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aymrnzianf0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aymrnzianf0</a>
 Illedan: \o/
 Astrobytes: reCurse, very nice, do you think you can squeeze much more out of SR?
 Astrobytes: Oh cool Illedan
 reCurse: No idea
 Illedan: Still only 5 angles?
 reCurse: Angle status: It's complicated
 Illedan: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Switching from 5 to full range when needed?
 reCurse: Something like that
 reCurse: I hit the submit limit
 Astrobytes: Interesting.
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: :D
 jacek: ban
 kovi: wow, below 10500, grat
 Illedan: Last week he was going full on going below 11000. Tomorrow it will be 10k :D
 kovi: im still above 11k
 Jasperr: I'm 36.18 away from joining the 11k league lol
 Ryan1243: hi
 Ryan1243: hi
 Ryan1243: hi
 Ryan1243: My name is Ryan
 Jasperr: Hi Ryan
 Ryan1243: Hi jasperr
 brettknowlton: i just "unlocked" the distance and angle variables, do i need to initialize them myself or does the game already understand them?
 reCurse: You need to modify the input parsing
 reCurse: You can backup your code and click on the arrow on top right to reset the code
 reCurse: Then it will have the correct input
 Astrobytes: Honestly, can CG not at least amend the stub for CSB so that the vars are there, if unused, once users reach Gold?
 AbundantPuddle: In Vindinium, I'm assuming mine battles always take precedence and occur before hero battles?
 Astrobytes: Yes, Hero battles are resolved at the end of the turn (it's there in the statement&#160;;) )
 reCurse: You mean they should implement a code scanner that correctly assumes where and how the input is parsed and used, and that the user did not touch it at all?
 AbundantPuddle: Oh, you are correct. Just reread the statement. Lol.
 Astrobytes: reCurse, I mean just have all the inputs there but with //unused until gold league etc
 AbundantPuddle: I tried to give gold for the hero to leave me alone. It didn't work.
 reCurse: Requires noticing and reading it, just like the statement
 reCurse: Not sure it helps
 reCurse: From CG's side the problem is already solved by never doing that again and relying on community
 Astrobytes: Yeah, true I suppose. Just gets tedious.
 reCurse: When I don't feel like it I just ignore the questions
 AbundantPuddle: if enemy_hp &gt; my_hp { enemy.giveGold(20); output="Please don't hurt me!"
 AbundantPuddle: }
 Astrobytes: That doesn't work AbundantPuddle
 Astrobytes: Yeah, also an option reCurse. Btw, how did the move go? Settling in OK I hope?
 reCurse: Yeah it's all good thanks
 reCurse: It's an easy move but still takes time to get shit done
 AntiSquid: the toilet sit isn't installed yet?
 AntiSquid: seat *
 Astrobytes: Cool, yeah, always worth it in the end
 Astrobytes: lol squiddy, ffs
 reCurse: Seat? It's just a hole in the ground
 Astrobytes: That leads straight to the neighbours
 Illedan: You have to fix a lot on the new place?
 AntiSquid: squat toilet&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Used a few of those in my London warehouse rave days...
 reCurse: There's always a few things... need to relocate a heating unit that's supremely inconveniently located in the living room where the tv should go
 Astrobytes: lol, I hate that stuff
 Astrobytes: What goes through some people's heads when they're installing things is beyond me
 reCurse: Yeah that one is puzzling
 reCurse: The entire tv setup before was puzzling
 reCurse: Anyway just gotta hire an electrician and hope it's a good one
 reCurse: Booked the painters too fast so gotta delay that too
 reCurse: etc etc
 reCurse: Fuuun
 reCurse: Just like optimizing SR actually
 Astrobytes: Easy enough job, just inconvenient.Hahaha
 Astrobytes: (wrt to the heating unit relocation, definitely not SR :P )
 reCurse: Totally expecting a Murphy's law there tbh
 AntiSquid: maybe it's meant as a "bonefire" of sorts
 reCurse: Won't go according to plan because whatever
 AntiSquid: that's life in general
 Astrobytes: My entire existence is Murphy's Law so yeah, probably :D
 Astrobytes: Still, it'll all come good in the end
 reCurse: Fast forwarding 6 months would be good on many levels
 reCurse: Anyway
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Agreed, would be done with my own moving then too. Just before the contest hopefully
 reCurse: Hopefully things starting to get back to normal
 Astrobytes: Don't jinx it Illedan
 reCurse: Going slightly crazy with this confinement bs
 Astrobytes: Mixed bag for me, I like it in some ways
 AntiSquid: there's on positive, people move out of the way when i walk on the streets, before they were carelessly bumping even 
 AntiSquid: most annoying is 5 people rows walking together and being oblivious to anyone in front of them @_@
 Jasperr: The trick is not to look any of them in the eyes and just keep walking straight xD
 AntiSquid: i do that, but still look them in the eyes
 AntiSquid: i mean wtf are you morons walking in a row for
 Jasperr: haha
 AntiSquid: the other day a lady stopped on the sidewalk and move onto the grass waving for me to pass ... wasn't gonna stop either way, as i walked past her she said out loud: "you're welcome" as if i was supposed to say thank you, there was plenty space for her to walk without stopping ...
 reCurse: You must be pleasant company
 AntiSquid: i am
 Jasperr: You could've smiled and said thank you to at least 3 people in the time it took you to write that loll
 AntiSquid: i guess it's me, since i said nothing eh?
 AntiSquid: i am going to stop on the sidewalk and shout "YOU WELCOME" to everyone passing me by lol
 AntiSquid: as i said, there was plenty space
 Jasperr: sure, ok, but maybe that lady had a different definition of plenty
 Astrobytes: It's fairly amusing to see all the junkies in my town lining up at the pharmacy waiting for their methadone. All social distancing and wearing masks and gloves. Then they come out, go buy cider and sit and share it between themselves in the square
 Astrobytes: :shrug:
 Jasperr: Junkies around our local coffeeshops dont even bother with the masks
 AntiSquid: maybe really scared, but don't see why i should stop and explain to her, might scare her talking towards her ... 
 Astrobytes: lol, they were them religiously. Half of them probably still needle-sharing too&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: *wear
 Astrobytes: Anyway, chat is distracting me again
 AntiSquid: if the wind blows 2 meters aren't enough either i guess
 AntiSquid: you might have to wear mask and goggles all the time
 Astrobytes: Actually the droplet dispersal should be enough not to cause infection in most situations, but still a chance
 AntiSquid: i think you, like me, are distracting yourself with chat, it's a choice, nobody is forcing you here, maybe what you try to do feels too mundane Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: If disableChat still worked I'd be alright
 AntiSquid: ah i have a solution for that
 AntiSquid: i use ublock origin to block the chat element
 AntiSquid: but then occasionally turn it off and check chat :p
 Astrobytes: Ah, yeah, that would work
 eulerscheZahl: or just keep chatting
 AntiSquid: also blocking the rank in IDE, if i see it drop i feel the urge to submit spam until i climb back up, losing focus fairly easy there
 Ziatzoraf: hi
 AntiSquid: hello Ziatzoraf
 eulerscheZahl: studying highschool, that's an awkward choice for a subject
 Jasperr: You should contact MSmits, he's basically addicted to it
 Ziatzoraf: i wanna do something as a volunteer
 JBM: to high school?
 JBM: "something"'s kinda vague
 Ziatzoraf: hmm yeah 
 Astrobytes: Leave high school. That's voluntary :P
 Astrobytes: (I'm waiting on a test case, hence return to chat)
 Ziatzoraf: :DD 
 JBM: what line do you draw between volunteering and slavery?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: how's things JBM
 JBM: so so
 JBM: you?
 Astrobytes: On the lesser side of so-so
 JBM: aww
 Astrobytes: But not terrible
 JBM: how may i cheer you up
 eulerscheZahl: with troll drawings
 JBM: wasn't the one enough?
 Astrobytes: I'm alright mood-wise, just grandfather issues
 Astrobytes: He's in hospital now, and likely won't be returning to his home when he's better.
 JBM: hey eZ, while you're...
 JBM: (22:12:55) eulerscheZahl a quitté le salon
 JBM: ok i get the message
 Astrobytes: And yes, MOAR of those amazing troll drawings :D
 JBM: yea those times are hard
 JBM: well i'm OBIOUSLY going to have to add moar
 JBM: but i'm too lazy to draw that much more
 JBM: so 1) i accept contribs
 JBM: 2) i'll set a troll pants color picker in the viewer params
 Astrobytes: lol
 JBM: i can't really accept a troll colour picker
 JBM: because it's going to be part of the game messages
 JBM: which can't be post-skinned
 Astrobytes: Get drawing some trolls eulerscheZahl
 JBM: he left
 Astrobytes: dammit
 AntiSquid: hey JBM when's your birthday?
 AntiSquid: i think i found something nice for you
 JBM: errrr zhere'd that come from?
 JBM: please share!

 JBM: you been drinking?
 AntiSquid: i don't drink
 JBM: errr rok anime avatars
 JBM: what's that gotta do with me?
 AntiSquid: just being nice, thought i found perfect gift for your avatarless profile
 AntiSquid: and early happy birthday!
 JBM: my profile's fine
 JBM: thank you so much
 JBM: and a happy unbirthday to you!
 AntiSquid: so much ungratefulness ... AutomatonNN not sure how to deal with this
 Ziatzoraf: actually there is a big difference between slavery and voluntering
 AutomatonNN: fix them and why is that correct that i don't know how to play it with a map of a game before or the
 Project-Magenta: AutomatonNN wat
 AutomatonNN: why not just put on the server?
 Ziatzoraf: voluntering = when you code or do something you can do this from heart
 Project-Magenta: ok
 Project-Magenta: xD
 AntiSquid: unbirthday&#160;? JBM what? excuse me? you suddenly hate me&#160;?
 Ziatzoraf: slavery= when you do something you feel bored and you wanna die
 JBM: oh sorry
 JBM: happy birthday it is, then
 Astrobytes: think he meant non-birthday squiddo
 JBM: (i've always hated you, why do you read that as sudden?!)
 Jasperr: watch out before he ban you
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: ah that would make sense Astrobytes
 Ziatzoraf: sorry i have been late beacuse i was doing something  
 Jasperr: what can moderators even do on cg anyways?
 JBM: yeah they really give those powers to the worst
 AntiSquid: i banned spammers
 Jasperr: oh they actually can ban?
 AntiSquid: what does that have to do with chat conflicts
 JBM: yeah what's the english term?
 Astrobytes: for...?
 JBM: the english term totally is unbirthday! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbirthday">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbirthday</a>
 AntiSquid: ah 
 AntiSquid: for leap year birthdays
 AntiSquid: need to fix my english&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Jeez, OK, we take Through the Looking Glass as a source of meaningful words
 Astrobytes: I raise your "unbirthday" with "runcible spoon"
 AntiSquid: "JBM 09:20PMyeah they really give those powers to the worst" thinking carefully about this, i have to completely agree with you, me being the exception ofc :thinking:
 JBM: Naturally.
 AntiSquid: no i mean i 100% agree there, so damn true
 AntiSquid: bunch of scumbags
 JBM: AMAB
 Astrobytes: lol, it's morphed into some kind of regular internet chat
 Astrobytes: Still waiting on you topping my "runcible spoon" JBM
 JBM: gonna be hard
 Astrobytes: (or just "runcible")
 AntiSquid: confused about the random "AMAB" in chat
 JBM: that just reminds me of rincewind
 JBM: and crucible
 Jasperr: whats a runcible spoon?
 Astrobytes: Terry Pratchett?
 JBM: so I'd need an [adjective] spork
 JBM: AntiSquid: look for ACAB
 Astrobytes: Google the "runcible spoon" Jasperr, it's from a poem
 AbundantPuddle: Is it akin to a crucible knife?
 AntiSquid: oh ... hm :thinking:
 Jasperr: lol
 JBM: most of lewis is "from a poem"
 Astrobytes: No AbundantPoolOfLiquid
 JBM: great excuse for legitimizing drug use
 AbundantPuddle: Lol
 JBM: sorry
 JBM: legitimiSing
 AbundantPuddle: It's actually a myth that Caroll was on drugs.
 JBM: the proof is in writing
 AntiSquid: how so?
 JBM: (and i *like* it)
 JBM: well... just read it, right?
 AntiSquid: maybe it's the gift to write like a stoner without ever getting high
 AbundantPuddle: That is not proof.
 JBM: yeah ok
 Ziatzoraf:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: I have no problem with usage of certain substances in all honesty
 JBM: it'd be if i were a psychiatrist
 AntiSquid: ok wait
 AbundantPuddle: There is literally no evidence whatsoever that he took drugs.
 JBM: nope
 JBM: literally none
 JBM: but opinions werent' formed out of the void
 AbundantPuddle: We know of many other authors and their substance abuse, so why not Caroll's?
 Astrobytes: But thousands of people who were thought he must've been, that counts for something right?
 AntiSquid: could have been a form of synesthesia, where the guy starts seeing colors from whatever other stimuli in his surrounding, for example some people with it get it triggered by music
 JBM: just read more from him&#160;:)
 JBM: yeah your crazy rationalization is as good as mine
 Astrobytes: Yeah AntiSquid I used to get that a lot on ac... I will not incriminate myself
 AbundantPuddle: Well considering most people who say he did drugs assume he was on LSD, which is a synthesized man made drug that didn't exist in his time, I find it pretty hard to believe.
 JBM: so maybe it wasn't lsd then
 Astrobytes: I never heard anyone say that
 AbundantPuddle: Psylocibin maybe?
 JBM: that's more or less "explicit"
 Astrobytes: *Psilocybin
 AbundantPuddle: Maybe he was hanging out with some fungi's?
 AbundantPuddle: Astro, you really seem to enjoy correcting my spelling. Lol.
 AntiSquid: what about lovecraft&#160;?
 JBM: completely diferent stuff
 AbundantPuddle: Astro is on drugs.
 AntiSquid: you need drugs to have a wild imagination?
 JBM: yeah, kind of
 AntiSquid: i don't think so
 JBM: until proved otherzise
 JBM: i'm not going to get my hands to accept this evening's current layout am i
 AntiSquid: other people don't tick differently eh?
 AbundantPuddle: So guilty until proven innocent?
 Astrobytes: Sorry, AbundantPuddle, born pedant, mushroom enthusiast and biologist with interests in organic chem.
 JBM: why the negativity?
 JBM: i see no shame in it
 Astrobytes: (general fungi I mean by enthusiast)
 AbundantPuddle: It's all good Astro. If I'm wrong with something, I expect someone to correwct me. Just giving you a hard time.
 AntiSquid: i don't see drug use as a necessity to have a wild fantasy, that's all
 Astrobytes: And I am on drugs, just legal ones.
 JBM: i... wish it weren't
 JBM: but am still not convinced of the opposite
 AbundantPuddle: Everybody is always on drugs all the time.
 AntiSquid: an assumption and there's no proof for it
 JBM: sure
 JBM: as is yours
 Astrobytes: I'll be honest, I've done my share of 'mind-expanding' substances in the past, and thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.
 AntiSquid: that people are different and don't all fall into a specific niche?
 JBM: that doesn't have much to do with it dose it?
 JBM: not that i disagree
 AntiSquid: it does imo, since i am sure some have less imagination than others
 JBM: likely
 AbundantPuddle: Please don't ever become a scientist or lawyer. You don't seem to fully comprehend the burden of proof.
 JBM: "the burden of proof lies on the minority"
 Astrobytes: I have a wild imagination, very creative, and let me assure you that what you can experience with certain substances cannot be conjured merely by 'imagining'.
 Astrobytes: @AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: so you are saying in order to write something like that drugs are a necessity
 Sian88: Came here to learn how to code, learned about drugs instead....
 JBM: no we aren't
 Astrobytes: Not at all
 AbundantPuddle: the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges
 Astrobytes: Sorry Sian88, just a particular branch we explored from earlier conversation
 JBM: AbundantPuddle: and where's *your* line between "charges" and "expressed opinions"? :D
 Sian88: Does anyone have any recommendations for a total beginner (despite 1 year of poorly taught C prog in uni) to try to self-teach?? (that preferably don;t require psychedelics - they are awfully hard to come by in isolation)
 AntiSquid: Sian88 wrong, you missed the main topic
 JBM: AntiSquid: they're easy to come by?
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M</a>
 AbundantPuddle: Is it an established fact that Caroll was a person? Yes. Is it an established fact he was on drugs? No. This is where your conjecture comes in which requires you to prove this.
 AntiSquid: vivid random thoughts? yes they are imo JBM
 JBM: Is it an established fact that he wasn't?
 Scarfield: or prove its a myth? :p
 Astrobytes: Sian88: Can you competently code in C? Are you familiar with any other languages?
 JBM: my conjecture is as good as youre, methinks
 Sian88: haha nope
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a> is a good place to start, also just to get a hang of how the site works&#160;:)
 Sian88: I know nothing. Honestly, my lecturer was awful
 AbundantPuddle: Again, please don't become a lawyer or scientist. This is not how the burden of proof works.
 AbundantPuddle: This is how conspiracy nuts have haydays.
 JBM: i *am* a scientist
 JBM: so too late for that huh
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: prove it!
 dbdr: stop being a scientist then /s
 Scarfield: that you are a scientist i mean
 JBM: that's Really Really hard
 Sian88: Thanks scarfield, on that now and still wouldn't be getting anywhere without the solutions
 JBM: it really permeates my life
 Astrobytes: Maybe try some Python or a decent C tutorial series Sian88?CG is kinda for when you have a reasonable handle on the language
 AntiSquid: chat isn't really helping with coding, there' rarely someone writing whole articles about their bots in chat and it's not feasible either, because then those people need to rewrite the entire thing again for every new person that joins chat Sian88, so you're better off checking forums for feedback and strategies
 AntiSquid: also the LEARN button at the top brings up a list of useful tutorials
 AbundantPuddle: Right Click - View Source - CTRL F - Solution
 AbundantPuddle: *"Solution"
 AntiSquid: as for Carroll to be perfectly honest, it feels like in a way he was describing the world around him, crazy people doing crazy things and then set it within a fantasy world to make it slightly obscure, but it feels like a perfect description of ...
 ArianPunk: It's my 20th day of learning C (it's sorta my first general-purpose language) and I can't stop using double pointers as they're lovely.How's my progress sound?
 twitlydoof: YO inpsiring
 twitlydoof: You here?
 twitlydoof: Inspiring Man
 Astrobytes: Carroll was a pretty talented guy, a lot of the meaning off his stuff is somewhat obfuscated with his wordplay and general playfulness in his writing style
 JBM: i hope that's me
 AntiSquid: this isn't a dating site, so probably not? twitlydoof
 JBM: wait---isn't it?
 AntiSquid: if it is then Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN are mechanical sex workers
 Automaton2000: yea i know msmits :p
 AutomatonNN: but i can't see how to code and what is the same asset on the contest for a while and i don't know w
 JBM: and we live them for it
 JBM: *love
 Scarfield: Automaton2000 "are you by any chance a ... pleasure model?"
 Automaton2000: one of the most important part

 Astrobytes: gogogo AbundantPuddle&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: What did I do?
 Astrobytes: (still had Vindinium open from earlier, saw your submit(
 Astrobytes: *)
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 JBM: submitted and on a rising slope in a multi?
 Astrobytes: Most importantly, not cheating&#160;;)
 AbundantPuddle: You can cheat? WTF have I been coding for then?!?
 JBM: wait, can we cheat?
 AntiSquid:  /cheats -on
 AbundantPuddle: Lmfao!
 AntiSquid:  /greedisgood
 Astrobytes: Premium account only
 AbundantPuddle: rosebud
 JBM: SPOILER ALERT
 Astrobytes: Is that a Citizen KAne reference?
 AbundantPuddle: Wait, how do you get the slash in chat?
 AbundantPuddle: \/test
 struct: Do I need premium to release Yinsh?
 AbundantPuddle: Nope
 Jasperr:  /likethis
 Jasperr: put a space in front of it
 AntiSquid: space slash
 AbundantPuddle:  /test
 AbundantPuddle: Oh, well that wasn't very fun.
 AntiSquid: or add some special char
 AntiSquid: claim slash doesn't work anymore
 Astrobytes: Just wait struct, CG devs will sort it soon hopefully
 AbundantPuddle: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, start
 JBM: what's wrong with yinsh?
 AntiSquid: struct thibaud mentioned on discord he told the devs about it
 JBM: (apart being from struct, ofc)
 JBM: yeah he always says that
 Astrobytes: yeah yeah konami code
 JBM: i think thibaud's a bot
 Jasperr: thats kind of his job xD
 Astrobytes: Thibot
 AbundantPuddle: The OG cheat
 JBM: if (complaining_detected()) say ("I had a word with DEV about it");
 AntiSquid: no he is just community manager
 JBM: nice of him being a manager
 struct: JBM there is a bug in aprooval and yinsh cant get aprooved
 JBM: but who's rthe community?
 AntiSquid: "managing" us
 JBM: and what's it there for
 struct: Everytime someone tries to aproove the 3rd time it doesnt alloiw
 JBM: he can manage me when he pays me
 Astrobytes: I thought we were in a TAZ
 AbundantPuddle: Oh, I thought Yinsh was already approved.
 AntiSquid: the CG community has same role as humans had for the greek gods, beings that generate prayers the gods feed on
 struct: I dont remember if I tried to aproove my own contribution with post or not
 struct: Just to test
 Astrobytes: struct, approve not aproove
 JBM: act it's "approuve"
 struct: aprovar
 AntiSquid: aproba
 AbundantPuddle: Astro, do you just sit there with a dictionary open?
 Astrobytes: I suppose 'aproove' is actually correct phonetically here in Scotland
 Scarfield: xD
 JBM: with their special /r/
 AbundantPuddle: Better than "aproofed."
 Astrobytes: No, I'm a lifelong Guardian reader, known for pedantry and correction.
 JBM: Pedantry is Important/
 Astrobytes: We didn't call it the Grauniad for nothing.
 AntiSquid: do you also trying to phonetically correct people?
 AntiSquid: try *
 AbundantPuddle: Ah, a pedantrophile?
 JBM: why try when you can just do it
 AntiSquid: youtubers call it a grammar nazi 
 Astrobytes: If they're trying to learn then yes. I would expect the same back
 AbundantPuddle: Wonder why that term never took off?
 AntiSquid: which one?
 Astrobytes: I'm not a grammar Nazi, but I try to help out with spelling or wrong words if people are not native English speakers especially
 AbundantPuddle: Pedantrophile
 Astrobytes: Pedantrobytes to you CopiusAmountsOfPooledLiquid
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 AntiSquid:  Pedantrophctyl
 Astrobytes: A Pedantrophile would be someone really into pedants...
 Man_on_the_Moon: ah
 JBM: like we needed that
 AbundantPuddle: Yes Astro
 Astrobytes: I'm not pedantic *all* the time btw, I need to be in my work, but in chat it's just a handy windup  mechanism
 Astrobytes: *mostly
 AbundantPuddle: And someone who is unable to achieve formalism would be "impedant."
 Astrobytes: That just makes me think of impedance
 AbundantPuddle: I was thinking more along the lines of "impotent." Lol.
 AntiSquid: why do i need to add all these annoying "throwsexception" bits in Java&#160;?!  why am i not allowed to have cleaner and more concise code&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Impedence -&gt; electrical circuits -&gt; speakers -&gt; soundsystem was my thought process there
 JBM: works for coaxial ethernet too
 struct: just ditch java AntiSquid
 AbundantPuddle: I guess if you formally hook wires up to your genitals?
 AntiSquid: i would do so without ever looking back 
 Astrobytes: Effective resistance applies to many things JBM
 AntiSquid: but to run the CG games locally you need Java ugh
 JBM: doesn't it
 Astrobytes: I know you know that
 JBM: i know you knew i did
 AntiSquid: you coded yinsh in java didn't you struct so ...
 Astrobytes: I knw I... .fk it
 AntiSquid: why not kotlin btw?
 struct: I had too
 <b>**Astrobytes resists the urge</b></p><p><img src="/a/43431408633599" /> <b>**AbundantPuddle viv la revolucion</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: never tried it
 Astrobytes: should've used Clojure
 Astrobytes:  /s
 AntiSquid: csj made his referees in kotlin, but i think there's still a bit of Java code filth remaining
 AbundantPuddle: Surprised Astro didn't correct my Spanish there.
 AntiSquid: vivende&#160;?
 <b>**Astrobytes still resisting </b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> JBM: clojure's fine
 AntiSquid: scala&#160;?
 AbundantPuddle: Well it could be vivende as well. But it should have been viva.
 Astrobytes: Oh, mi corazon
 JBM: that's a natural typo everyone read through
 AntiSquid: lamb hearts 
 AbundantPuddle: Hahaha
 Astrobytes: Never used Clojure actually
 JBM: just do roller coasters already
 Astrobytes: Oh it has a Clojure reward
 AntiSquid: if you try to do CG language achievements you end up having to use every single language on CG eventually
 Astrobytes: That's only bad if they add a D achievement
 AntiSquid: have you tried D?
 struct: fact: rollercoaster can be bruteforced in javascript but not on c++
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 AntiSquid: it's relatively easy compared to the others
 Astrobytes: I didn't like it at all.
 JBM: D is a very good language
 AntiSquid: you can't like all languages
 JBM: the fact it came to life here is a real problem
 AntiSquid: why
 JBM: but you can only blame its zealots for that, not tha actual language
 AbundantPuddle: Fortran
 struct: D top 1 language 2020
 Astrobytes: It has some cool features and whatnot, I don't get on with it personally (wrt D). And I have no real use for it.
 JBM: why? because it was a dlang.org-mob-driven op, and did'nt stem from an actual need/desire for the language here from any subcommunity
 AntiSquid: the D zealots are a bunch of cowards, as soon as D was added instead of teaching the will of the D they ran off with their tails between their legs
 Astrobytes: Yes. I sincerely hope CG learned from that.
 JBM: just see D as C++ without the legacy
 AntiSquid: will of D is one piece refefence in case anyone missed it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Will_of_D">https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Will_of_D</a>.
 AntiSquid: reference *
 Astrobytes: If I was a mod I would kick you for every 2nd anime reference :P
 AntiSquid: you can't kick other mods
 Astrobytes: MAjor platform flaw
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: also you can't stop anime same as people didn't manage to stop the spread of the bible, anime will come
 Astrobytes: I see...
 Uljahn: forced spreading is not nice
 Astrobytes: In the general case?

 Astrobytes: jacek :joy:
 Astrobytes: 40.f
 Astrobytes: woops
 Astrobytes: wrong window
 AntiSquid: 40f is that a Java float variable&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No
 Astrobytes: And it was also a typo, should've been 4.0f
 iduel: where can i learn coding easily for free?
 JBM: i can give you free lessons for $$$
 iduel: which language?
 Astrobytes: Where can I lear to fly a plane for free?
 JBM: whichever
 Astrobytes: *learn
 Astrobytes: lol JBM
 iduel: :joy:
 Trice: Is there someone, who solved the Tron battle, and in silver league?
 JBM: you don't "solve" tron battle
 JBM: you "compete"
 Astrobytes: I told you this about Code Royale the other day Trice
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm going to watch something and fall asleep, gn/bn
 JBM: like, the TvC last battles?
 JBM: gn8 astroes
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: bn JBM
 JBM: it's out of alpha! spread the word!
 JBM: LOL just noticed AntiSquid competed in D
 JBM: you troll
 YurkovAS: Trice for tron use Voronoi Diagrams. game description has link
 JBM: or just floodfill
 Trice: Thank you for the tips :grin:
 AbundantPuddle: I code in JavathonScript D#+.NET
 AbundantPuddle: It's OOPs
 JBM: it so is
 AbundantPuddle: Sometimes I like to refer to  it as OOPsie dAIsies.
 AbundantPuddle: I like my numbers like I like my friends - imaginary.
 BieberFever419: 6+9i
 daffie: was that last code clash broken or just me?
 daffie: AbundantPuddle
 AbundantPuddle: I'm not sure what you mean daffie
 daffie: were you able to solve it
 daffie: because I knew my math was right but it was expecting answers that were off by like 1 digit like a typo or something
 AbundantPuddle: I personally didn't in time, but it was solvable.
 AbundantPuddle: Did you round up if it was a float?
 daffie: it was simple algebra
 AbundantPuddle: The directions specified to round up.
 daffie: round(d/((d/x)-y))
 daffie: is what I was using
 AbundantPuddle: That doesn't necessarily round up
 AbundantPuddle: You need something like math.ceil
 daffie: I was using ceil, but that's not the issue
 daffie: for example like I think number 5 was d=9999, x=12, y=10. I was getting 4999.5 but it was expecting 49995
 AbundantPuddle: I can't say for sure. I don't remember the test cases, but there were people with programs that used expressions that worked 100%.
 daffie: yea they used no math, simple loop, add x, subtract, y, count the number of iterations it takes to reach d
 daffie: I totally thought of doing this, but thought that the math would be simple enough but I was wrong
 AbundantPuddle: I'm fairly certain the top two who had the shortest code used a mathematical formula.
 AbundantPuddle: I could be wrong. I only glanced at their code, but I was pretty sure I saw formulas and not loops.
 daffie: nope he used a loop, but it was a language I see people use for like code golf and stuff where it can be written really compact

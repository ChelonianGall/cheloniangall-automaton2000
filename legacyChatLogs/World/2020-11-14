 NinjaDoggy: tomatoes why did you lie to me&#160;:( you do 9 learns
 Zenoscave: I have some bug where my bot thinks it can't complete any tasks. Its driving me crazy and super sporadic
 tomatoes: it seems turn increment in wrong place :sweat_smile:
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 Yanners: This game is tough, I've been stuck for hours :grinning:
 DaNinja: me too, I still cant figure out the read ahead tax
 reCurse: Figure out?
 DaNinja: if I learn a spell with a tax on it, do I get the tax ingredient too?
 reCurse: Yes
 guspihl: I just faced a reverse mode i couldnt figure out, which is bugging me
 guspihl: and noone shared their code
 DaNinja: thats the stock and tomeStockGain in the referee?
 guspihl: is there any way to find out the answer anyway?
 Donotalo: what's the preferred ai algorithm to apply for this game?
 NinjaDoggy: BFS,simulation for now
 Donotalo: what do you mean by "for now"?
 NinjaDoggy: if you can make a bot that knows how to cast/brew well then it's going to be like top 20
 reCurse: So if you make a bot that plays the game well it's top 20? :thinking:
 NinjaDoggy: ok but
 NinjaDoggy: once it's standard(like most bots have it)
 NinjaDoggy: then other things become important
 NinjaDoggy: like the simultaneous turns and stuff
 reCurse: Hmm.
 NinjaDoggy: also, you don't have to have good learning yet
 NinjaDoggy: so i guess that's in the "stuff"
 Icebox: reCurse are you tryharding on a bot or taking it more relaxed this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: he can't relax
 Doug: Okay, hopefully someone can help..  How do you know which spells are yours?  From my understanding, they have an ActionType of CAST, and your opponent has OPPONENT_CAST.  However, when I play my code, every spell I hover over, on either side, has an ActionType of CAST.  Am I missing something?
 jacek: only CAST are yours
 Icebox: Doug it's visual
 Icebox: when you "hover" over a spell
 Icebox: it says "CAST"
 jacek: also, happy Caturday
 Icebox: but in input
 Icebox: it will show up as opponent_cast
 Doug: Ah, okay.  Then I have a different bug.  Thanks!
 ClockSort: I got into the top 100 by taking the cheapest spells 5 times from the tome, then never running LEARN again. So the bots aren't too smart yet.&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl are you nerfing your bot currently? Out of curiousity
 Zenoscave: Your ms counts are surprisingly low
 ClockSort: how do you see the ms counts?
 Zenoscave: he debugs them in his messages. not everyone does
 Zaphus: so he could be lying&#160;:-)
 ClockSort: very kind of him :D
 Zenoscave: Zaphus, I doubt it but true
 Zaphus: you don't want to look at my messages&#160;:-)
 Zenoscave: looking now
 Zenoscave: I knew it
 Zenoscave: Somehow I just knew it
 Zaphus: sorry 
 Zaphus: but you knew the rules
 Zenoscave: It was good
 Zenoscave: and so did you
 AbsentMoon: Anyone have any tips for deciding when and which spells to learn?
 rcar: learning a bunch of the free ones early seems to be a local maximum
 AbsentMoon: How are you using your spells? Are you using a points system of some sort?
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave i could go higher. and it would obviously help. but for the sake of faster submits that's something for the last day
 rcar: I'm doing them at random which is why I'm rank 300-400
 eulerscheZahl: and the lower i rank the easier it is to see improvements just by submitting
 AbsentMoon: rcar so you are casting random spells and then just crafting whatever potions you can afford?
 eulerscheZahl: could be random but this submit already gained 8 spots. I improved pruning which equals to a speedup
 rcar: yes, until I finish implementing any sort of search
 AbsentMoon: Ah. I think I am going to try and implement some sort of points system.
 Zenoscave: makes sense eulerscheZahl
 Zenoscave: And I thought I was going to have a chance at 1st c#&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: still early in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: next on my list: reasonable LEARN
 Zenoscave: much too early to tell
 eulerscheZahl: there are games where i only learn 1 spell in the entire game :D
 eulerscheZahl: and i lose those, big surprise
 Zenoscave: You know of the current cheese?
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501127992">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501127992</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: what is it?
 Icebox: learn 10 at the start
 Icebox: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have something better in mind
 Icebox: not a big fan of it but from what I've seen in chat seems like a lot of people do it
 eulerscheZahl: no need for cheese if you can do it right
 Zenoscave: better bonus eval is my next todo
 Zenoscave: then a better intermediate heuristic scorer
 Maliamnon: I ended up with 10 tier-3 ingredients in my inventory on turn 40 and lost&#160;:(
 Maliamnon: oops
 eulerscheZahl: been there before :D
 Maliamnon: it looks so good, then it's all so bad so fast lol
 eulerscheZahl: minigame idea: who can deadlock himself the fastest?
 Zenoscave: Is  while True: print("WAIT") a deadlock
 Zenoscave: :P
 Maliamnon: or, who can get 1 blue, 2 green, 3 orange, and 4 yellow the fastest
 MadKnight: that's basically the same as getting things for a recipe which u are already doing
 Zuciso: All the best
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave val growth also likes your cheese"I put my first 10 LEARNs in the 1500th place without LEARNs, and I got to 50th place after the first 10 LEARNs, so it's pretty hard to tie up without LEARNs this time."
 Zaphus: I think emils strategy is grab so many spells that most bots time-out trying to process it.  gets #1 spot in the cheesiest way
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even sim the opponent :D
 eulerscheZahl: emil plays differently in IDE vs arena
 Csipcsirip: yeah thats what i wanted to say. I don't think many players sim the opp. 
 Csipcsirip: emil is using rust, which runs in debug mode in ide
 eulerscheZahl: not yet. not sure if ever
 eulerscheZahl: except for endgame detection maybe
 eulerscheZahl: i have debug mode in IDE too
 NinjaDoggy: end game detection but also if someone is going for a brew and they reach it earlier than you, then it's pointless to go for it
 Zaphus: how do you detect you are in the IDE?
 eulerscheZahl: only Rust and C# can do that
 Marcelo-Hackerman: Hey guys
 eulerscheZahl: release mode on submit, debug mode in the IDE
 Zaphus: that's handy
 Zaphus: wouldnt be hard to give you a #define or similar in other languages
 eulerscheZahl: at least for C# define doesn't work anymore
 eulerscheZahl: at first it even set the DEBUG flag
 lowzhao: if my inventory is full what should I do?
 Zenoscave: good to know eulerscheZahl
 Zenoscave: ah chat scroll
 NinjaDoggy: @lowzhao, don't make it full&#160;:)
 lowzhao: D:
 Marcelo-Hackerman: is this website good for practicing?
 lowzhao: I try my best
 Zaphus: so is the emil I play when I choose an opponent a different one to the one that gets #1 spot (via debug or something)?   because I can beat it every time here which seems odd
 eulerscheZahl: yes, different behaviour
 Zaphus: sneaky
 eulerscheZahl: play vs #2 then
 eulerscheZahl: still strong enough to kick your ass&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: rust = automatic bot hiding? :O
 NinjaDoggy: not hiding, but makes it so people can't tune their bot to do well vs u
 Zenoscave: How can it detect this?
 eulerscheZahl: last contest my C# bot had lots of IDE timeouts
 Zaphus: sems a little unfair when others can't do that
 Zenoscave: Then code in c# or rust
 NinjaDoggy: to be fair...
 Zenoscave: no one stops you
 Marcelo-Hackerman: am i playing against bots?
 NinjaDoggy: it's more like the other way around lol
 eulerscheZahl: maybe rust has a debug mode check? or you compare file sizes?
 NinjaDoggy: they can't test their code easily in the IDE
 Icebox: ok
 NinjaDoggy: so... trade off&#160;:/
 Icebox: I rewrote my code
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 Icebox: took only 26h
 Icebox: time to debug this bad boy
 eulerscheZahl: C++ now?
 Icebox: yes
 Icebox: oh
 Icebox: you mean the rewrite
 Icebox: no, it's in python
 Icebox: but now I can start with C++
 eulerscheZahl: so you start with your 3rd version now?
 Icebox: for me personally it's easier to rewrite python into C++ than to write C++ from scratch
 eulerscheZahl: sounds inefficient
 Icebox: yea
 Icebox: I mean
 Icebox: for each his own...
 eulerscheZahl: like my colleague "i have to write this letter in english. i'll start in German and then translate it"
 NinjaDoggy: lol i can relate with icebox
 NinjaDoggy: i always start in java and then try to rewrite in C++ at the end
 eulerscheZahl: you totally notice when you read it, the structure of the sentences doesn't sound english at all
 NinjaDoggy: wait... i just had a realization and am kind of sad now&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: I came up with some fancy bitmask way to represent inventory and do operations quickly but...
 Zenoscave: We definitely don't have the hunger like that of a bear either
 NinjaDoggy: there's only 1001 possible inventorys, so you can just precompute all the transitions
 Zenoscave: colloquialisms are hard
 Icebox: welcome to the club NinjaDoggy&#160;:)
 Icebox: you just guessed what I've been doing 
 NinjaDoggy: -_- lame
 Zenoscave: YOU GUYS ARE PRECOMPUTING. I'M BEHIND
 NinjaDoggy: no... i'm bitmasking
 eulerscheZahl: same :D
 NinjaDoggy: going to switch to precomputing&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: this.Inventory = player.Inventory.ToArray();
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that efficiency
 NinjaDoggy: ok if i switch to precomputing and C++ oh boy
 NinjaDoggy: the amount of extra sims i can do :O
 Zenoscave: wait How did you get the 1001 number
 NinjaDoggy: quick exhaustive search
 NinjaDoggy: of all 4 numbers summing up to 10 or less
 Zenoscave: oh i didn't think of that
 Icebox: eh
 Icebox: that's lame 
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes stupid is more efficient than smart
 eulerscheZahl: i found a player who says "snif" when detecting a loss :D
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 Icebox: @NinjaDoggy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A000332">https://oeis.org/A000332</a>
 NinjaDoggy: :O nice
 Icebox: math is cooler than summing up to 10
 NinjaDoggy: nah i'm not a fan of math
 NinjaDoggy: computing is cooler :P
 Zenoscave: I want euler totient functions
 NinjaDoggy: i need to exhaustively list out all the states anyways
 eulerscheZahl: NinjaDoggy now set your limit to 9 or 11 and compare with the sequence
 eulerscheZahl: did Icebox even find the right one?
 NinjaDoggy: yea he did
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 Icebox:&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: idk how it's right though...
 Zenoscave: it's also the sum of 1 to n for totient _ 4 (k)
 NinjaDoggy: because it's wrong for small numbers
 NinjaDoggy: like 2
 Zenoscave: hooray partition theory
 NinjaDoggy: or 1
 NinjaDoggy: or 3
 Zenoscave: because those are less than 4
 NinjaDoggy: but 0 sequence is ok
 Icebox: NinjaDoggy you have to discard the leading zeros
 NinjaDoggy: oh right, nvm lol
 Icebox: from the sequence
 NinjaDoggy: yea it's just correct
 Icebox:&#160;:)
 Icebox: its basic combinatorics tho
 NinjaDoggy: ok now it's time for you to code it anyways to form your states&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: but yea that is pretty cool
 Zenoscave: Are all the actions known? or are they randomized
 Zenoscave: like do the tome entries change
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;?
 DaNinja: they are shuffled
 Zenoscave: but not edited? Just order changes?
 DaNinja: yep
 NinjaDoggy: yea there's a fixed list of actions
 Zenoscave: cool. Looks like I know my next steps
 NinjaDoggy: 42 tomes and 36 deliveries

 Zenoscave: thanks!
 NinjaDoggy: honestly, might be a good time to switch to C++ if i'm going to switch to precompute :thinking:
 dbf: you are discussing precompution of applying casts to inventory?
 NinjaDoggy: yea, casts, brews, tax
 eulerscheZahl: why can't you just play like normal persons?
 Icebox: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: have some fun. give others a chance as well...
 Icebox: oh euler is trolling 
 eulerscheZahl: realizing that a good rank will be hard work
 NinjaDoggy: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: and i want silver. 2k in bronze is a lot
 NinjaDoggy: yea... early silver would be nice
 NinjaDoggy: on the other hand 10/10 initial submits do feel good&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: does*
 eulerscheZahl: well... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vizhem">https://prnt.sc/vizhem</a>
 NinjaDoggy: lol just resubmit&#160;;)
 dbf: do you have chat window cleared and reset every 5 minutes also, or it is something with my browser?
 eulerscheZahl: my chat sometimes crashes the whole tab
 Icebox: saaaaame
 eulerscheZahl: 2k users in chat is no fun
 NinjaDoggy: hey euler
 NinjaDoggy: how do you deal with the single file requirement in codingame?
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 eulerscheZahl: multiple + merger
 NinjaDoggy: oof
 NinjaDoggy: ok
 NinjaDoggy: so same as me&#160;:(
 dbf: I have something like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://c2n.me/49OR8jk">https://c2n.me/49OR8jk</a> but at least my internet connection is stable
 NinjaDoggy: do you have one for C++?
 JamesOnnen: does it just copy to your clipboard?
 eulerscheZahl: no, only c#check the forum for C++
 NinjaDoggy: ok will do, thx
 eulerscheZahl: mine writes to a new file from where i copy
 NinjaDoggy: yep similar, i print it to stdout
 NinjaDoggy: and then just copy all it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359/</a>you could automate further but meh
 Icebox: codingame is making fun of me
 Icebox: I finally submit something working, just for the website to tell me to "improve my bot"
 eulerscheZahl: captcha?
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/zDeId1D">https://imgur.com/zDeId1D</a>
 DaNinja: cg-sync is great for automatic uploads
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Icebox: feels bad man
 eulerscheZahl: you are pretty new to CG, not sure if you knew about that already
 eulerscheZahl: wait, that's in the highest league
 eulerscheZahl: misleading hint at best
 Icebox: yes :D
 eulerscheZahl: new players might get confused for real :D
 dbf: I am confused because there is no 'Submit' button now :grinning:
 Icebox: madknight took over hints
 Icebox: Improve your bot eulerscheZahl
 Gonny: NinjaDoggy when you print to stdout and copy, did you just write something to remove the extra spaces and turn numbers?
 DaNinja: Your bot sucks, fix it!&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: @gonny nah, not that tryhard XD
 lowzhao: How to know how much others have brewed.
 Gonny: so you delete the lines by hand?
 Gonny: I also do that, but find it quite annnoying oO
 NinjaDoggy: wait what lines?
 Icebox: track it lowzhao
 lowzhao: score change?
 Icebox: yes
 lowzhao: damn so crazy
 NinjaDoggy: deleting stuff for code size?
 NinjaDoggy: or deleting stuff to make it compile?
 NinjaDoggy: keep spam submitting euler&#160;:)
 Gonny: to get the stdout as an input without having the extra blank and score lines mess it up
 NinjaDoggy: i can get top 10 soon&#160;:)
 lowzhao: thanks Icebox
 Gonny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f334003-ce45-462f-8ef0-e6523d2b1675">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f334003-ce45-462f-8ef0-e6523d2b1675</a>
 Gonny: see the lines in the middle?
 NinjaDoggy: oh! we're talking about different things
 NinjaDoggy: yea for that
 NinjaDoggy: i manually delete&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: should probably make something for it tbh
 Gonny: haha ok
 Gonny: yeah I keep telling myself that too
 Gonny: and end up never doing it&#160;:/
 NinjaDoggy: yea... everytime i need it
 NinjaDoggy: I'm busy debugging XD
 NinjaDoggy: and then when i find the error i'm like "phew ok done"
 Gonny: haha totally
 Gonny: alright just wanted to check I wasnt'missing any easy option
 Gonny: thanks for the confirmation
 MindController: Guys am i doing something wrong?
 MindController: chrono::duration_cast&lt;chrono::milliseconds&gt;(chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - start).count()
 MindController: If this gives me numbers biger than 100
 MindController: When time limit is 50 ms
 Mazelcop: do you start the chrono after you get the first input&#160;?
 MindController: Before?
 MindController: It should be after?
 Mazelcop: you should start it after, otherwise you are measuring your opponent's turn
 MindController: Actually it still gives time &gt; 50
 Gonny: actually NinjaDoggy I think for this challenge the extra lines are always the same: 4 before a new turn. So I just added 4 lines of input() and I problem solved, at least for this contest&#160;:)
 Gonny: I think problem solved*
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/hGbABvp">https://imgur.com/hGbABvp</a> literally 2 timeouts
 Icebox: it do be like that
 NinjaDoggy: :O that's true!, thanks gonny
 [Csongor]: I love how I just I rewrited some unreasonable code and it's worse than it was when it was unreasonable.
 [Csongor]: What do you use to determine the value of a potion, is my price/amountOfMovesToMakeThisPotion bad?
 NinjaDoggy: it's what i use too
 NinjaDoggy: but it's not perfect
 [Csongor]: I lose because I make more potions but at a smaller price
 NinjaDoggy: wait what?
 [Csongor]: so
 NinjaDoggy: price/amountofmoves should prioritize big potions
 NinjaDoggy: if you search deep enough
 [Csongor]: I know
 JamesOnnen: picking the left most potion  and just picking legal moves with a weight towards that potion got me into top 100
 [Csongor]: I think I knw the problem
 [Csongor]: It set the depth to 2
 NinjaDoggy: lol yea that's probably it
 [Csongor]: It = I
 Maliamnon: i get so anxious when i submit. I plummet into the low 300-400s, then slowly climb back into the top 70-80 lol
 VizGhar: I've just realized, that my brain is damaged by years of coding in style "Just Display what backend sends you"
 eulerscheZahl: here your bot is the backend
 ChenHuang96: does codingame have a debugger option? like stepping through each line and watch window for variable values?
 dbf: ChenHuang96, you may print values to stderr
 ChenHuang96: alright, thanks
 Rodrigo_the_coder: lol
 ppeter: csongor hi! :D
 [Csongor]: hi
 ppeter: magyar?&#160;:)
 [Csongor]: igen
 [Csongor]: yes
 ppeter: haha jonapot
 ppeter: hows the lockdown at home?
 [Csongor]: not bad
 ppeter: cool, just surprised to see a fellow homie at this time&#160;;)
 sdaletskyi: Hi, am I getting rules wrong or there is a bug (0 &lt; actionCount ≤ 100)&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/rjvUdoF">https://imgur.com/rjvUdoF</a>
 eulerscheZahl: actionCount is not the same as actionId

 sdaletskyi: ok, thanks
 fboccacini: am i missing something?  everytime i try to learn a spell it says "not enough ingredients to learn x"
 fboccacini: they all have tax 0
 pb4: tax is what you'll receive
 pb4: If you learn that spell
 fboccacini: yes, but i can't acquire them in the first place
 pb4: But you still have to pay its own tax, which you can calculate by the position in the tome queue
 pb4: the first one costs 0, second one costs 1, etc..
 fboccacini: that would be in tier 0 ingredients, the blue ones, rigth?
 VizGhar: it cost (tier0*tomeIndex)
 pb4: Yes
 fboccacini: i'll try again, but i was sure i had enough even for that
 fboccacini: well, it happens with the first on the list also
 VizGhar: first is at the bottom&#160;;)
 fboccacini: alright! that's what i was missing
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: glad to help
 fboccacini: thank you! i just noticed, it actually had tom_index 4.. :grin:
 Donotalo: i taught my witch to learn, now she doesn't have time to brew potion&#160;:(
 stylemanguy: Hey guys, can the repeatable spells be cast any amount of times? 2 times or 5 times for example?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you don't run out of storage
 stylemanguy: ok cool!
 stylemanguy: that will be interesting to model in some tree search 
 MadKnight: anyone is using BFS&#160;? is it good&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i tried and gave up on BFS
 Westicles: So there have been 50 previous contests, and 0 won by an american?
 strlcat: then take the initiative&#160;! :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: you checked every single one of them Westicles?
 Westicles: yep.  The oldest ones were mostly French
 eulerscheZahl: do i somewhere see how many potions i finished or do i have to count myself?
 lowzhao: u need to count yourself
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: morning
 mootez_nabli: hi
 mootez_nabli: I want to be perfect in js 
 mootez_nabli: how?
 [Csongor]: simple: practice
 Donotalo: i'm getting this warning:
 Donotalo: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 eulerscheZahl: do you have multiple print statements?
 [Csongor]: you have a print somewhere before reading an input
 eulerscheZahl: probably printing twice in the same turn
 strlcat: agree&#160;! 
 Csipcsirip: I had that warning when I accidentally put two endlines after the command I printed
 Donotalo: i couldn't find double printing
 Donotalo: however my code was timing out
 Donotalo: i was searching too deep
 Donotalo: after reducing depth, the warning goes away
 Nerchio: usually this error is either a timeout or double printing
 Csipcsirip: yeah that warning is a clear sign, that something is wrong your code :p
 MadKnight: then what are u using euler&#160;?
 MadKnight: or Csipcsirip
 Csipcsirip: I'm using BFS atm, but i don't think it's top10 wothy, so I might replace it soon
 MadKnight: Csipcsirip but with what&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: with an other algorithm :p 
 MadKnight: u haven't decided yet which one&#160;?
 Doju: So, umm
 Doju: to make a search of some kind, is this basically what one might need?
 Doju: -a gamestate of some kind
 Nerchio: in the higher leagues yes
 Doju: -a thing to simulate future gamestates
 Doju: -a data structure to hold the states
 MadKnight: yea
 Doju: -a thing to look through the structure and find the best one
 Csipcsirip: not yet MadKnight, but I think it'll be some kind of ugly hybid algo
 Doju: I think i might give it a shot for the first time
 Doju: thanks
 MindController: Guys taxCount for tome can be negative?
 DaNinja: no, its the number of tier0 items you receive from learning the spell
 MindController: But if its 3rd spell i need to pay extra 2, so it wont be -2
 MindController:&#160;?
 zapakh: That's tomeIndex
 DaNinja: taxIndex is 2
 DaNinja: *tomeIndex
 MadKnight: taxIndex doesn't include extra payment
 MindController: Thanks
 Westicles: Anything interesting in github besides all the spells?
 DaNinja: you could try reverse engineering java shuffle() to get the next tome and delivery&#160;;)
 Doju: This thing is gonna branch really fast because the potions and tome are random, right?
 Fox787: would be better to work out the average combination of all tome, work out what resources are more common
 Doju: Right, that basically cuts down like 30^5 + 40^6 branches on every step 
 Doju: yeah there's no way anybody was doing that
 struct: There are plenty of seeds to be able to find out which one is being used. But  I can be wrong
 zahariaca: tome is not random
 struct: zahariaca is not random?
 WINWINWIN: Any idea when Silver is opening?
 zahariaca: 16th :D
 Nerchio: monday
 WINWINWIN: Thanks&#160;:)
 zahariaca: "The tome is not infinite, there are exactly 42 spells within." from the description :D
 zapakh: Shuffled though
 struct: yeah, but they are shuffled
 zahariaca: yes true
 struct: The tome is random, the spells are not
 ToshiTuringMachine: it's very sad that you all are thinking of hardcoding the solution
 zahariaca: ok, understood, I miss read the discussion
 ToshiTuringMachine: but yeah, probably the winner in legend league will have to exploit the pseudo random generators
 blasterpoard: ToshiTuringMachine how about no?
 ToshiTuringMachine: they will
 Nerchio: nah
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 struct: I also dont think it will happen
 zapakh: I'ma press X to doubt
 zapakh: Lots of probabilistic precomputation though
 ErikBrendel: it currently says that silver is opening "11/17/20" - what's up with that? Was the date moved?
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi eulerscheZahl! top ten again?
 ToshiTuringMachine:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: for now
 eulerscheZahl: have to improve my performance a lot
 struct: it says 16-11 for me ErikBrendel
 eulerscheZahl: creating 2k new lists each turn is a bad idea
 Illedan: Just ask me next time euler, I'll let you know it is bad.
 ToshiTuringMachine: :P wooow superhero illedan how are you?
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: get it workingstep 2: get it fast
 Nerchio: 3. even faster
 ToshiTuringMachine: this chat is always full with best geniuses of the world
 struct: I do those steps
 struct: but reversed
 eulerscheZahl: 4: give up and cry in the corner
 Illedan: Hi, I'm playing around in an offline project working on performance and analysation of spells and customers.
 Nerchio: realise you code in Java and go back to if logic
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm still between 1 and 2
 blasterpoard: I search ~150K states per turn... not too fast either
 zapakh: *cries in 1K states per turn*
 struct: 150k seems decent
 ToshiTuringMachine: isn't that funny that google destroyed microsoft in company leaderboard?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i can double zapakh but your number is jaw dropping
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Nerchio: euler C# blaster C++
 Illedan: I checked if I had enough resources, but forgot to make the cost positive -.-
 eulerscheZahl: i have realease mode
 struct: still c++ is not 75x faster
 eulerscheZahl: no, that's a coding style thing
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i have some ideas. after lunch
 struct: allocating new memory costs a lot
 ToshiTuringMachine: what about rust? I see a lot of them
 zapakh: I'd kind of believe it once you get it down to a memcopy. My state copying is slow as heck
 struct: rust has release mode too on arena
 ToshiTuringMachine: also go seems having similar performance
 eulerscheZahl: and first python down to 23 already
 zapakh: I might go with Go idk
 eulerscheZahl: meta evolves to search faster than i expected
 struct: Do you think enemy prediction will be important at all?
 eulerscheZahl: as important as for STC
 Illedan: Yes
 Illedan: agreed
 zapakh: Probably, in Legend
 ToshiTuringMachine: zapakh how do you learn go? i did the codeacademy course but didn't find anything advanced
 zapakh: golang.org tutorial
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan: yes = important or yes = STC?
 Westicles: The winner will be the guy with the best tax algorithm
 blasterpoard: early game, learning correct recipes is important (sooner than the opponent); late game, prediciton helps with choosing the correct potions
 Illedan: ^
 zapakh: Yeah it's kinda bad to follow a plan for a potion only to have it disappear due to enemy action
 ErikBrendel: (can somebody please tell me what STC is?)
 Illedan: Anyway, off to work on the house. ttyl
 Illedan: Smash the Code
 struct: ErikBrendel a multiplayer, Smash the code, is similar to puyo puyo
 ErikBrendel: ah ok, thanks&#160;:)
 ToshiTuringMachine: i feel like this contest is similar to code4life but without shared ingredients
 eulerscheZahl: much different
 eulerscheZahl: as in: a heuristic won't make it to legend
 Nerchio: im doomed
 ToshiTuringMachine: and prize that time was money not t-shirts
 eulerscheZahl: C4L had no money prizes (but no tshirts either)was an iPad for the winner  and something along the lines for 2nd and 3rd as well
 struct: 4.5k players
 struct: damn
 zapakh: Yeah Silver League is going to be a real land grab :D
 struct: 2.5k are on bronze
 eulerscheZahl: that will be a laggy promotion
 struct: Will probably be the biggest ammount of player promoted at once 
 zapakh: Do you guys know how many battles have been run? Because it seems like a lot.
 struct: Dont think we have access to that data
 struct: Would be a nice stat for CG to share at the end
 struct: Number of games played in arena and number of games played on IDE
 eulerscheZahl: last time they published these stats in a blogpost
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/spring-challenge-2020/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/spring-challenge-2020/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 5 million battles, 114,932 code submissions
 zapakh: nice
 struct:  And 4,955 players
 struct: How many will it be for this
 struct: 6k?
 Westicles: The replays are numbered, you can tell from that?
 eulerscheZahl: i go with 7k
 eulerscheZahl: no Westicles. while we play teh contest, others try the onboarding :D
 struct: Westicles but replays from other games also increaase that number
 Westicles: ah
 eulerscheZahl: 13,699 participants4,955 finaliststhat counting...
 eulerscheZahl: register to be a participant. submit anything and you are a finalist
 struct: deceiving
 struct: participants and registered would do it justice
 eulerscheZahl: who cares about those who register but don't play anyways?
 zapakh: But but engagement!
 eulerscheZahl: obviously we don't work in marketing
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, lunchtime. and then i'll try to increase my sim counts
 struct: bon appetit
 zapakh: Good luck
 Hvosten: I thought that if I first cast six spells I will win :D dammit
 struct: close enough
 Doju: Aand again my code is devolving into spaghetti. How surprising.
 MindController: Is it valid to compare vectors in c++ with ==?
 casmith789: sure
 blasterpoard: if you want to check whether they contain the same items, no
 geppoz: always valid, depends what you want to check&#160;;)
 casmith789: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/operator_cmp">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/operator_cmp</a>
 MindController: I would like to check if they contain the same items
 blasterpoard: actually, it looks like it is correct
 blasterpoard: according to the reference
 Westicles: Yeah, it used to not work but I think it does now
 casmith789: it will be correct unless you are doing something weird like storing two sets of pointers and comparing them
 blasterpoard: TIL vectors have operators &gt;,&gt;=,&lt;,&lt;=... c++ surely has a lot of stuff I have never even considered
 zapakh: STL is pretty great
 anoburn: Is there any way to rewrite a printed line? I've tried to use \r to reduce my output, but it seems to do nothing
 struct: what do you mean anoburn?
 casmith789: save the string you want to output in a variable, and then overwrite the string. output the string at the end (don't write output and then overwrite it)
 anoburn: I'm basically trying primitive error-hunting by building prints into my code. But it overwhelms the output, so I would like to always overwrite the same line until the code breaks. So I can't save it in a variable and print at the end, because it breaks somewhere before
 anoburn: Usually with \r you can just jump back to the beginning of the line and overwrite previous prints, but I guess the codingame output does not work like a usual terminal
 RockyMullet: hum, why did I win&#160;?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/501326995">https://www.codingame.com/replay/501326995</a>
 RockyMullet: I randomly got 5 points in the end
 struct: the resources you have on inventory
 struct: above tier 0
 zapakh: @anoburn does your language have exceptions?
 RockyMullet: what&#160;!?!?! that's a thing&#160;?
 struct: give 1 point each
 struct: yes
 RockyMullet: I don't how I manage to missread the statement every contest lol
 RockyMullet: thanks for the info
 anoburn: I guess I can try using some, although there is no obvious error, just a timeout. But maybe I just don't see it in the output
 blasterpoard: C++ errors are hard to debug here
 zapakh: It's a shame we can't pipe output through tail or something
 blasterpoard: either test locally, or make only small changes to make sure you know what's broken
 RockyMullet: anoburn CG will call crash "timeouts" since you never sent an ouput since you crashed
 anoburn: Aah. Is there a way in C++ to catch all exceptions?
 xylorg: I don't understand the tome + tax stuff&#160;:(
 RockyMullet: like blasterpoard said, your best bet is to test locally
 blasterpoard: not every C++ crash is an exception
 RockyMullet: but you'll need to go get your input and read that
 blasterpoard: (most aren't)
 anoburn: oh well ... looks like I don't have another choice. Thanks
 struct: xylorg if you want to learn a spell from the tome that is not the one at the bottom you must pay a tax for every spell bellow it
 zapakh: Yeah, I was thinking more like Java
 struct: for example if you want to learn spell at index 2, you must pay 1 tax to index 0, and 1 tax to index 1
 struct: 1 tax = 1 tier 0 ingredient
 RockyMullet: tomeindex is pretty much the price you need to pay
 struct: If you learn a spell that has tax, you will get the tax, the excess will be discarded
 RockyMullet: so if (tier0Count &gt;= tomeindex)and your good to go)
 kovi: the usual hungarian pack
 Tomfu: Hello everyone, is it just me or is the input broken for other people as well? Yesterday everything worked fine and suddenly today he complains that I don't read all the input, does anyone else have that problem?
 zapakh: Only happens to me when I time out
 Nerchio: maybe you print something twice or timeout
 Tomfu: If I timeout, I don't read everything even if it is at the start?
 Tomfu: I mean even if my reads are at the start?
 RockyMullet: Likely what Nerchio saif
 RockyMullet: said*
 RockyMullet: if you output twice, it all becomes out of sinc
 RockyMullet: or you have an early out in your loop
 RockyMullet: meaning you dont read the end of it, there's a lot of input in this game
 anoburn: Next thing: how do I run it locally? :sweat_smile: Is there a guide somewhere?
 xylorg: struct what you mean by&#160;? If you learn a spell that has tax, you will get the tax, the excess will be discarded
 struct: If there is a spell that has tax in it
 struct: you will get the ingredients that are there, it will be N tier 0 ingredients
 xylorg: Ingridients to make cast the spell or the output of the spell its self?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/uKxQru5.png">https://i.imgur.com/uKxQru5.png</a>
 struct: See those blue ingredients?
 struct: if you learn spell at the bottom
 xylorg: Those are taxes
 struct: you will get 2 blue ingredients
 struct: yes
 struct: When you learn that spell you get the tax
 xylorg: But since is the last one on the tome shouldn't be free?
 struct: yes its free
 RockyMullet: anoburn euler wrote this for smart people<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 xylorg: so why it has tax on it?
 struct: because on the previous turns spells above it have been learned
 struct: Imagine that you always lurn spell at index 1
 struct: You will always have to pay a tax to spell 0
 xylorg: Ok yeah it drops down on the list and then it becomes free makes sense
 RockyMullet: but if your dumb like me: I make a define like "OUTPUT_INPUT" and add a bunch of #ifdef around the cinn to log them all in the error log. Run the game once on CG, copy that log to a file. Make a new stream which read this file. Then I run it again with the define and it's like I'm reading from CG the same game
 RockyMullet: it is tedious the way I do it, I'll have to make it better at some point
 RockyMullet: I plan to try the euler way at some point, but I'm pretty dumb when it comes to web
 xylorg: So is like i Learn ID i got that spell. If is like tomeIndex 1 it will automatically pay 1 tax to the underling spell, and then i'll got the spell. If i learn the last spell (or any spell) that has tax paid on it i'll get the tax back
 struct: anoburn also you can run the referee offline
 struct: yes
 struct: if you learn at tomeindex 2, you will have to pay to tomeindex1 and tomeindex0
 RockyMullet: yeah, that's even smarter
 xylorg: It will launch error if i don't have ingredients right?
 struct: a warning
 struct: you wont timeout
 zapakh: You lose your turn, though
 xylorg: And last thing repeatable is on the same turn? So i can cast it twice in a row in my own turn?
 Westicles: Those twitch streams are possibly the most boring things I have ever encountered
 anoburn: And how do I run the referee offline? :D
 zapakh: Westicles Even better when people come to Twitch to complain how boring I am :D
 RockyMullet: Westicles lol I think CG automaticly detect twitch with a codingame tag or something
 Tomfu: @RockyMullet, but I haven't changed anything since yesterdays last run, I doubbled, tripple and quadroupple checked
 struct: There are a few good streams
 struct: errichto explains things well
 RockyMullet: I missed it but I'm pretty sur Illedan's one was interesting
 VizGhar: Hmm when should I start counting turn time?
 RockyMullet: when you timeout :P
 struct: after reading first input
 RockyMullet: oh you mean in the loop lol
 jacek: where else? :thinking:
 RockyMullet: well the question was when
 VizGhar: just asking&#160;:) I'm currently loosing many games, because of timeout even tho I'm checking it... I'll look for error then
 RockyMullet: I still rarely go over 1 ms with a dept 2 search, I guess I should kick my but and make it posible for depth N
 Nerchio: :O
 Westicles: They playbacks show a red splotch when you timeout, so you can zoom in on it.  Or at least they usually do
 RockyMullet: there is way less permutations than other games
 blasterpoard: depth is very important, though... going for potions fast means you can't use those ingredients to make more ingredients
 blasterpoard: and then I often beat weaker bots like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/501338498">https://www.codingame.com/replay/501338498</a>
 VizGhar: ah now i see the error in my code.. qick fix
 zapakh: ...Hey!!!
 RockyMullet: blasterpoard yeah, going depth 2 made a great impact, specially for learning spells
 zapakh: Yeah, I keep my inventory pretty light and it limits my options...hmm
 blasterpoard: zapakh sorry&#160;:) I just wanted to demonstrate a gaem against a bot that doesn't search beyond the first brew
 zapakh: Haha no hard feelings I think it demonstrates it really well
 RockyMullet: blasterpoard how deep do you search&#160;?
 blasterpoard: 20
 struct:&#160;?
 struct: what
 struct: I quit
 jacek: only spells?
 RockyMullet: nice
 zapakh: I do try to search beyond the first brew, but it doesn't make much difference when my depth only goes to 6 or so
 RockyMullet: I can believe that, my depth 2 rarely go behond 1 ms, the sim is really simple with not that many permutations
 wlesavo: blasterpoard do you search with learning or use separate estimations?
 blasterpoard: wlesavo wait for postmortem
 wlesavo: kk np :slight_smile:
 jacek: but i want to know right meow
 RockyMullet: and the deeper you, go less spells are available to cast or learn and less brews are brewable, so it does go down in permutations the deeper you go
 VizGhar: :D ask him for algo right away :D
 blasterpoard: still, the bots at the top have lots and lots of room for improvement
 zapakh: "rest" is also a move
 blasterpoard: for example, I still ignore some rules
 RockyMullet: I just leanred that &gt; tier0 in your inventory give points lol
 zapakh: Some endgame attention can definitely finesse a few extra wins there
 RockyMullet: yeah, I often have some "urgency" edge cases in my bot when the game is about to end
 RockyMullet: removed the one I had on this one cause it sucked
 RockyMullet: but if I try to become a big boi like blasterpoard and go for depth N, probably make it more agressive with prioritizing sooner result would help
 Nerchio: so if you do that then do you search for anything
 Nerchio: like any potion
 Nerchio: or perhaps its better to direct the search towards potion you choose
 Nerchio: i wonder between these 2 atm
 Ikhadem: can i go back in leagues ( just to sort my thinking ) wnna go step by step in my logic
 RockyMullet: also a pretty easy thing (I'm might do it) would be to know that your opponent is about to brew their 6th potion and try to stack the most &gt; tier0 in your inventory since it's gonna end next turn
 Nerchio: unfortunately no Ikhadem
 struct: rocky doesnt matter
 struct: if he brew 6 he wins
 Ikhadem: can i go back in leagues ( just to sort my thinking ) wnna go step by step in my logic
 Nerchio: struct i think thats not true
 Nerchio: its about points
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 struct: oh no
 struct: I was wrong
 struct: sorry
 RockyMullet: struct no
 Nerchio: you can lose by brewing 6th potion and having less points
 struct: yeah I got confused
 Nerchio: you can essentialy win the game by brewing something like 4 potions if your enemy brews low value stuff :D
 RockyMullet: the replay I sent you that I didnt understand how I won what that situation, my opponent brewed 6th potion, but I won from inventory
 zapakh: I cast random spells if brewing a sixth would kill me, but I haven't seen it help yet
 RockyMullet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/501326995">https://www.codingame.com/replay/501326995</a>
 RockyMullet: but I only got lucky, might as well try to do that
 RockyMullet: damn nondeterministic bot&#160;! Not giving the same gmae in IDE
 Ikhadem: h
 RockyMullet: ok found out another game where I lose from enemy brewing the 6th potion first :upside_down:
 ehamza: Hi all
 dreadylein: hi
 ehamza: who's new here
 ehamza: like me :D 
 struct: plenty of people Im sure
 ehamza: :D 
 Nerchio: I'm new here playing since 1 year
 Nerchio: :joy:
 zapakh: I've been new forever
 ehamza: :D 
 zapakh: ugh the sun is up
 zapakh: why
 lechium06_: @Nerchio Neeb vs TY in 1h, who are you cheering for?
 Nerchio: I don't watch SC2 too much anymore tbh, but I saw buy TY vs Serral or Reynor would be more fun later
 Nerchio: to watch ;p
 Nerchio: not sure what 'buy' in my sentence was supposed to be
 Nerchio: not many Koreans left, Serral or Reynor vs KR would be more fun later
 Nerchio: thats the message xD
 lechium06_: that 'buy' was the accidental swarmhost
 Nerchio: but i am programming my witch atm
 Nerchio: not swarmhosts
 lechium06_: I'm pretty sure we're gonna get Serral vs TY tomorrow
 Nerchio: good
 lechium06_: btw I guess there's still a bit of competitive mindset left, except for coding instead of SC2
 lechium06_: cheers man, glhf
 Nerchio: for sure there is 
 SimonPrins: Funny, I'm coding a SC2 AI. :D
 [Csongor]: How can I create a copy of my list of Spell class in C#? I searched for almost 30 minutes now, but nothing works.
 Barimehdi77: I want to get the id of The potion who has  the highest price so I write the folowing code

 VizGhar: you ate probably computing againt all actions, not BREW only?
 linjoehan: you got to put highest = 0 at the start @ Barimehdi77
 Barimehdi77: yeap I think so
 Barimehdi77: so the spells have no price?
 linjoehan: if you don't give it a value it will have the value of what ever was left in those memory by the last thing that touched it. which might have been Chrome
 linjoehan: and yes spells have no price
 offroff: you need to pay the blue ingredient corresponding to tomeIndex (if tomeIndex is 0 it's free)
 offroff: that is if you learn a spell
 Barimehdi77: but when i edit my code to this
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db990f7d-51bd-4c79-ad63-dd891e074017">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db990f7d-51bd-4c79-ad63-dd891e074017</a>

 Barimehdi77: and the id 44 have the lower price not the highest
 ErikBrendel: Have you defined highest and id_of_hight_price outside of the loop?
 Barimehdi77: no inside of the loop
 ErikBrendel: try moving it outside, that may help
 zapakh: Why inv.&#160;?
 Barimehdi77: i make a struct to store the data of my inventory in inv
 zapakh: but you updated id_of_hight_price, not inv.id_of_hight_price
 Barimehdi77: I try to remove inv. but I get 0 in all the output

 zapakh: how about adding inv?
 Barimehdi77: I tried to move highest and id_of_highest outside the loop and i get the same output
 Barimehdi77: zapakh: could you explain more?
 zapakh: Did you want id_of_hight to be in the inv structure or no?
 linjoehan: you are updating id_of_height_price which is not the thing in your struct I think it should be t_inv.id_of_height_price
 Barimehdi77: zapakh yes that's what i trying to do
 linjoehan: No inv.id_of_height_price
 zapakh: ^
 Barimehdi77: when I did it i get the same init value
 zapakh: Because you're not initializing inv.id_of_hight_price&#160;?
 linjoehan: What he said
 ErikBrendel: (how can I send a private message to somebody?)
 linjoehan: click on their name and it will open a private window?

 Barimehdi77: the val id_of_highest dosen't change I dont know why?
 eulerscheZahl: ErikBrendel or a private message on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: that always works and even sends an email
 Quidome: it depends which one
 Quidome: forget it I was way back in the chat :P
 eulerscheZahl: in which chat? :P
 geppoz: "Whenever they memorise a spell with ingredients placed upon it, they also acquire those ingredients, which become usable on the next turn. If the witch's inventory is full, the excess is discarded."?
 struct: the spells that have tax on it
 struct: The resources will go to your iventory
 geppoz: so just one tier-0
 struct: But only the resources that are on tax, so only tier 0
 struct: or multiple
 geppoz: ok
 Quidome: Learned spell are repeatable by default?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the spell
 eulerscheZahl: some are. the "spawns" aren't
 zapakh: Used to be :p
 eulerscheZahl: true :D
 Maliamnon: Quidome - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495</a>
 completementgaga: please, for the fall challenge, i don't understand the format of the orders' data, do we have to store it when the first loop is running?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 offroff: the potion bonus, do we need to keep track of that or can it be parsed?
 Xenoid: The bonus is included in the price
 offroff: k, thx
 ErikBrendel: you mean the urgency bonus? This is _not_ directly part of the price, but instead in the tomeIndex variable for orders (see input description)
 Xenoid: The urgency bonus is included in the price
 Xenoid: price the amount of rupees this will win you if this is a potion recipe, 0 otherwise. This includes the urgency bonus. 
 zapakh: Yeah, that turned out to be incorrect
 zapakh: Er, n/m I think they changed it
 offroff: yeah, the urgency bonus, thx for telling
 struct: price includes bonus
 Quidome: OK, let me refrase, the spawned spells are not repeatable and all the tome spells are?
 zapakh: Only some tome spells are repeatable
 Xenoid: The tome spells that have a cost are repeatable
 Quidome: Aha, that helps
 Xenoid: The tome spells that are all upside (only pluses) are not repeatable
 Quidome: thnxs&#160;:)
 VizGhar: I believe (about that repeatable flag) there was some bug previously? Read that in forum. But yes, you should check repeatable
 TheExtremeHacker: hi
 whensday93: hi all
 tomatoes: hi whensday93
 TheExtremeHacker: .
 Quidome: Is there a limit on the number of spells learned?
 tomatoes: 42+4
 Quidome: :D
 Quidome: ok, thnxs
 QPN: hello
 geppoz: can we assume the tome is given in order, in input (it seems so, but can we rely on this)?
 tomatoes: you can sort it by tomeIndex
 geppoz: i know, just asking if i can skip that sort, since it seems already given in order
 geppoz: ok, silly question :D
 Washier: tomatoes, would love to hear your take on this. Any tips\thoughts
 Washier: *on this= broad srtategy
 tomatoes: bruteforce for now
 Earthborne: Warning about printing before reading all inputs, is that more probably the bot being too late?
 Counterbalance: it's most likely the bot printing more than once in 1 turn
 Xenoid: Earthborne, I have gotten that warning when running out of time sometimes
 Washier: ty
 Earthborne: Yep, Xenoid that's when I'm getting it too, when I increase my search depth too much
 cegprakash: is 1300 a good rank without learning skills?
 cegprakash: did anyone make it to top 500 without learning spells
 Hvosten: 700-800
 geppoz: im 955 without learn
 Earthborne: ^ same
 cegprakash: that's amazing
 cegprakash: I'll try some replays with u guys
 tomatoes: learn some first free
 RockyMullet: hu, the last battle doesnt show me the right game...
 RockyMullet: ok refreshing it worked
 RockyMullet: was weird, I lost a game, pressed "show" to watch it, watching it: I win. Then I realize it's not even the same player im against
 Earthborne: Is anyone else experiencing the displayed score at the end of the game not matching the one on the end of game screen?
 geppoz: y
 RockyMullet: Earthborne yes
 Xenoid: You get points for each remaining ingredient from tier 1, tier 2, tier 3
 RockyMullet: I just learned this morning that all tier1 and above in your inventory gives you 1 extra point in the end
 Earthborne: Oh, okay
 Earthborne: I just had a game where I lost just because of that
 Marcelo-Hackerman: how do i get a better rank?
 Amitos: is there something after bronze league? or is it just compete for the best rank?
 Donotalo: click on the league
 Quidome: silver, gold and legend&#160;:)
 Earthborne: Silver, gold and legend are being released soon
 Amitos: oh cool
 struct: A player from top N% will be chosen as the boss, and all the players above it will be promoted
 struct: if you are not promoted, you can still be promoted later by submiting and getting above the boss rank
 Quidome: silver wiil open on the 16th
 Maliamnon: Marcelo - make your bot smarter. Personally I like to watch the battles I lose very closely and correct the dumb things my bot does
 RockyMullet: wondering if my current bot will be good enough for straight to gold
 RockyMullet: 63, hum not sure
 struct: doubt it
 Washier: I'm guessing the game won't get more complex beyond bronze? anyone have a better guess?
 RockyMullet: obivously good enough for silver
 Xenoid: There will be no additional rules added
 Washier: ty
 RockyMullet: other bots make it harder, not the game itself
 Washier: just curious, how do you know?
 geppoz: wtf the actionId of the LEARN will not be the same for use it??
 Xenoid: Because it's been that way for years
 RockyMullet: Washier has been like that for years
 Washier: haha
 yonder83: players can learn same spell
 Nerchio: i am rank 900 using only basic spells
 Nerchio: :joy:
 struct: I need to start coding
 RockyMullet: Nerchio really&#160;? I had to implement spell learning to get to bronze, life's not fair I guess
 Washier: ty RockyMullet . sounds right
 Nerchio: Rocky atm i have depth 4 bfs its probably better than many newbies :D
 RockyMullet: yeah well thats better than mine haha
 RockyMullet: just added depth 2 yesterday
 Earthborne: Wow you're doing so good with only depth 4?
 Washier: jeepers, any trees at this stage is quite good imo
 Nerchio: i mean its depth 4 with only basic spells xD
 Nerchio: i dont buy anything
 RockyMullet: well im 58th with depth 2
 Nerchio: you have depth 2 probably with buying spells and all that funky stuf
 RockyMullet: yeah im surprise is doing good actually
 Nerchio: so thats better ;P
 Bobbadillio: I'm 1700th with waiting every turn, so y'know
 RockyMullet: depth 2 without learning spells was making my bot worse
 Washier: impressive for depth 2
 Bobbadillio: things are getting pretty serious
 struct: Rocky I was lucky and got bronze with my 5 minutes code
 struct: My first submit
 Washier: not a simple game this
 Nerchio: im not sure really if buying spells should be in my search algorithm
 Maliamnon: I am doing depth 3 with an ingredient value heuristic and i'm top 50&#160;:) 
 RockyMullet: Nerchio learning a spell means you can use it on dept + 1
 RockyMullet: you can also learn a spell with tax on it instead of casting a spell giving you only tier0
 Nerchio: well i guess there is some merit to it
 Nerchio: but im thinking if i don't find a nice path towards anything then i should be looking for optimal spells
 struct: I think I must try this game
 Nerchio: not neccessarily ones that will open a path to 1 out of 5 potions
 RockyMullet: Maliamnon I should probably do that... I treat all ingredient as same value rn
 struct: I never do well on these kinds of games
 struct: because I dont know what to implement
 Maliamnon: I have learning in mine Nechrio
 Washier: same here struct
 RockyMullet: struct feel you, it's hard to visualize
 Maliamnon: RockeyMullet - I derived it from the list of all potions
 RockyMullet: I like to watch a multiple game to think about what I could do, this one, it's hard to see
 Maliamnon: it's solvable with about 10 minutes in excel&#160;:)
 Earthborne: Oh, I dropped my search depth from upto 10 to 4 and it gave almost the same score
 RockyMullet: wait a minute
 RockyMullet: potions are hardcoded&#160;?
 Icebox: yes
 Earthborne: guess depth isn't all
 jacek: eeyup
 RockyMullet: oh god
 Maliamnon: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 RockyMullet: *scribles notes furiously*
 struct: recipes too
 Icebox: I have a weird question with a wild guess
 Washier: *squinting*
 struct: yes Icebox?
 Icebox: My code that runs around 900ms on turn one had a timeout probability of around 5% tonight
 Icebox: without changing anything it rose to around 40%
 struct: ouch
 Icebox: could it be that server is just having more stress and takes slightly longer?
 RockyMullet: does past potion can come back&#160;?
 Icebox: with more people submitting
 Maliamnon: Icebox - I think the hosts are slower during busy times, yeah
 Washier: *noob* busy ersvers
 Icebox: okay thought so
 Washier: *im noob*
 Doju: What's the point of opponent_cast?
 Doju: Just so that you know that the opponent has that spell available?
 struct: to know opponent learnt spells
 Doju: ok thanks
 RockyMullet: Doju knowing opponent spells, so you can predict
 Maliamnon: Doju - you can guess/predict what they're doing if you want
 Doju: right
 RockyMullet: I still dont do anything with it, but I get the idea
 Doju: Yeah. I'm just trying to get a super basic and super shallow sim working before I have to stop
 Doju: so that's not gonna be happening haha
 RockyMullet: so my question got lost in the chat, if a potion is completed, can the same potion come back as a new potion&#160;?
 Washier: aren't the potions random
 reCurse: It's impossible
 RockyMullet: Washier apparently not
 reCurse: You can only complete 11 potions at most
 Washier: aah, ty
 reCurse: And there's 36 of them
 RockyMullet: so the potion order is predetermined at start
 reCurse: Yes
 RockyMullet: not everytime a new potion pops up
 RockyMullet: good good thanks
 reCurse: It's a shuffled deck
 Doju: Do I have any chance at getting a search of at least depth 2 working with python?
 RockyMullet: also go away reCurse im #1 in canada
 Doju: I really can't rewrite this in c++
 RockyMullet: shhussh
 reCurse: You're not&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: hahaa
 geppoz: Doju i also think i'm going to switch from python to c
 Bobbadillio: anybody else like rust? :D
 Doju: yeah geppoz that's a good idea but i really only have this afternoon to finish this
 Washier: ooooohhhhh, some Canadaian fighting talk going on
 Washier: very polite
 Washier:&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: canadian trashtalking is pretty intense yeah
 Bobbadillio: If you're coming from python, I think you'll have better luck picking up Rust and having a compiler that checks your code for fundamental problems
 Doju: Hm
 geppoz: no I'm newbie in python
 Bobbadillio: What I'm saying is: as someone who switched from python to rust for this sort of thing, I write terrible code
 geppoz: try to use to learn it
 Doju: I've had a look at rust and it looks interesting
 geppoz: im confortable with java, c
 Washier: then rust is natural
 geppoz: so i don't want to learn rust too :D
 Bobbadillio: legit! :D
 reCurse: It looks good but I'm always worried about the lack of external libraries/support when they're needed
 Uljahn: they said python is viable :pensive:
 reCurse: There's more to a language than a language
 Bobbadillio: Yeah, some of it's pretty new, and the library ecosystem is definitely not fully mature/complete
 Washier: true that
 Bobbadillio: The ML/Data Science stuff for example is pretty rough
 geppoz: yeah it is, i'm having depth 7 in python
 Bobbadillio: And it just added language support for async/await with a somewhat controversial syntax?
 geppoz: but i suppose when things will get more serious we will need far more
 Doju: Wow really geppoz? How much pruning are you doing?
 Washier: for ML/DS its almost no choice, python or R
 Bobbadillio: jUliA
 geppoz: BF, but not use LEARN
 struct: D
 Washier: not taken off
 Doju: Ah, right.
 geppoz: with LEARN will be a problem
 RockyMullet: geppoz at some point depth is not as meaningfull, since your opponent can screw up your predicition
 geppoz: yes right
 geppoz: +as soon as he took away an order...
 RockyMullet: my only enemy prediction right is checking if he can brew a potion
 RockyMullet: and I dont much with it
 RockyMullet: use it as a tie breaker
 RockyMullet: and if its the last potion, I try to full my inventory of tier1+ ingeredients
 reCurse: Wasting a weekend over 2.6k players bronze league sucks
 dbf: we don't have portions count for players in input so need to track change in score?
 RockyMullet: yeah, a contest starting a thursday, it's a long time before silver
 RockyMullet: I feel they should've open silver tommorow instead
 RockyMullet: or even today
 RockyMullet: bronze is still about implementing the last set of rules
 RockyMullet: silver is where the "rule completeÈ bots are
 struct: Also silver will be quite big
 reCurse: I doubt that
 reCurse: Given how simple the game is I'm pretty sure the top 100 has all rules
 Washier: simple?
 reCurse: Simple rules yes
 struct: Game is simple to implement
 Washier: &lt;cat crying meme&gt;
 RockyMullet: it's pretty much a bunch of substractions and additions in the end
 geppoz: :D
 struct: Having chat open is almost impossible atm...
 Bobbadillio: @RockyMullet All computer science is fundamentally just a bunch of logical operations
 RockyMullet: true true
 Washier: yes, also see the simple adding vetor angle, but still not simple
 Spifflejedi: o/
 geppoz: there will ever be any reason to "WAIT"?
 RockyMullet: geppoz I dont see any
 Majeck: To Forfeti
 Majeck: *forfeit
 geppoz: learn the free one instead, right?
 struct: to trash talk your opponent
 geppoz: :D
 reCurse: LEARN 0 is the new WAIT
 Spifflejedi: hey for the experienced player, do we have any idea of the probability to get the +3 / + bonuses?
 RockyMullet: my fall back is to check if there's an ok spell to learn or rest
 RockyMullet: but since I added learn and rest in my sim, it doesnt reach the fallback much anymore
 Washier: sim is working then
 RockyMullet: I also learn a bunch of spells at the begining to reduce the possibility of locking myself in an impossible situation
 RockyMullet: Spifflejedi it's first potion +3, second +1 and there's a max to it
 geppoz: with "LEARN" my depth dropped to 5
 reCurse: You're never locked though
 Washier: so RockyMullet,you do more than if-else?
 RockyMullet: geppoz youre bot is probably better still
 RockyMullet: Washier yeah I know it's unusual coming from me lol
 RockyMullet: rip heuristic bot
 Waffle3z: if your inv has 10 t3 then you're stuck unless something requires all t3
 Washier: cool ty, also aiming for that
 RockyMullet: reCurse by locked I mean, no spell that can be casted
 reCurse: So you learn new ones
 RockyMullet: exactly
 Washier: what do I do with "@Inject ". why aren't game engines done in C&#160;:)
 reCurse: Not sure how that's better or worse than learning random ones at start..
 Spifflejedi: @RockyMullet: I've read that but the description suggests the bonusnis not garanteed even if all the bonuses haven't been granted yet
 RockyMullet: well at the start of the game you still have plenty of time to make poitions, more spells = more posibilities
 Doju: Ohh
 reCurse: I'd argue there's no difference between random learns at start and when you're stuck
 RockyMullet: will in the sim, (at least mine) I only leanr spells that I can use in the near futur
 Doju: no wonder my bot wasnt brewing things
 reCurse: I'd even go to say random learn at start is always worse
 RockyMullet: reCurse oh yeah thats for sure
 Doju: i gave those actions a negative value haha
 RockyMullet: worse
 RockyMullet: nah
 reCurse: Yeah
 RockyMullet: it costs 0
 RockyMullet: but maybe it's how my current bot works that make it better
 Earthborne: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction" getting this again, but now I was only just reading input and printing 'LEARN &lt;tome[0]&gt;'
 reCurse: I'm pretty sure of my position but I won't bother proving it&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: probably with a deeper search I could drop it
 RockyMullet: and I can for sure be wrong
 dreadylein: @earthborne did you restart your loop after it&#160;? Or is the rest of your logic still running after it?
 Earthborne: heh, ofc, pretty much "if early game: grab spell else: do search"
 Earthborne:     if turn_count &lt; 5:
 Washier: ty
 RockyMullet: I probably should do at least depth 3
 RockyMullet: something I never do right now
 RockyMullet: is cast a spell to get tier0 to learn a spell, to then use it
 RockyMullet: which can only be done with depth &gt;= 3
 struct: Just go depth 20
 Washier: hehe
 RockyMullet: yeah I'm more affraid of miss evaluating the score when going too deep
 RockyMullet: if I think I can pull this awesome move in 20 turns, but get blocked by the other player at turn 19, I waste my time
 Average_Barclays_Employee: I'm on Wood 1 League and I'm getting error "attempted an invalid action:Spell 78 is not repeatable'
 Average_Barclays_Employee: Is it a bug?
 RockyMullet: Average_Barclays_Employee you trying to cast a spell you already casted without resting
 anoburn: The messages from earlier are sadly gone.Is there any chance to get actual debugging output from c++? I've got the game to work locally, but have no idea how to get any output except what I see on codingame anyway
 RockyMullet: some spells are repeatable and dont need to rest to be recasted
 Xenoid: anoburn, use cerr
 Washier: ^^
 RockyMullet: when at least locally you can break in your code
 anoburn: Xenoid, that doesn't tell me what happened when my code just crashes
 jacek: then cerr every line and see when it stops :v
 RockyMullet: well you have a call stack and the whole memory to look at
 anoburn: how do I look at that?
 RockyMullet: pretty much 1000 times better than debugging with cerr on CG :P
 anoburn: that's exactly my hope :D
 RockyMullet: are you using visual studio&#160;?
 Uljahn: RockyMullet: what? repeatable spells allow multicast in one turn and then you have to rest to reuse them, no?
 anoburn: yeah. I launch the game from Eclipse and have my bot added as an agent
 RockyMullet: I'm not really familiar with other IDE
 RockyMullet: Uljahn huuuuuuuu
 anoburn: Problem is I'm not launching the code from visual studio, but from Eclipse when the game is simulated
 RockyMullet: you are making me doubt myself now
 jacek: yeah, you can cast more times in 1 turn but its not castable
 eulerscheZahl: i switched from MonoDevelop to VS code for this one
 RockyMullet: Uljahn oh shit you are right
 RockyMullet: "Some spells are repeatable, meaning they can be used multiple times on the same turn before becoming exhausted."
 struct: Im using vs code with  wsl2, it has been fine
 jacek: i use notepad.exe :v
 PrgmrN: i use geany&#160;;)
 RockyMullet: it's not really important in my depth 2 sim since I can never cast the same spell in 2 different turn, but I'll have to take that into account for depth N
 anoburn: And do you launch the game from VS? Or how do you get at the call stack?
 eulerscheZahl: i copy-paste the input of 1 turn to a text file
 eulerscheZahl: and use that as stdin when running my code locally
 RockyMullet: I cant speak of other IDE, but in VS when you debugin mode, you have a window with the callstack and a watch to look at your variables
 anoburn: aaah
 RockyMullet: yeah like euler said
 anoburn: Sounds tedious, but very helpful
 Washier: RockyMullet, VS debug is my home
 Earthborne: Trying to time first turn now, and after first loop of input I'm apparently on &gt;3 sec, is that weird?
 FrankR: can you learn a tome spell when your inventory is full, but the spell pays for itself due to the tax back?
 eulerscheZahl: no, you have to pay before
 FrankR: (oh and your inventory contains no tier0 resources)
 zapakh: Learned that one the hard way&#160;:)
 FrankR: hrm.. ok.. thanks
 Uljahn: i guess excessive tax returned is ignored
 eulerscheZahl: eventually the opponent will learn cheaper spells and unstuck you
 Counterbalance: Earthborne you should start measuring after reading the first line of input, each turn. The 3s you see is the referee and the other bot starting up etc..
 SujalAI: I tried prioritizing potions of higher price first but the results were very bad, I can't figure out why. Does anyone have an idea why?
 Earthborne: Oh, even if I start from inside the game loop?
 casmith789: probably because higher price potions are harder to make
 casmith789: (on average)
 SujalAI: oh
 SujalAI: Is there a way to get the code for the  deafult ai?
 struct: no
 Uljahn: yes, you should be one of CG staff
 jacek: or mod
 struct: I can already see the pms coming
 FrankR: our company has players ranked ~400, 514, 758, 1305, 2375. The top 100 company has 952, 1152, 2564, 2845, 2926.. why isn't our company listed? I thought the top 5 employees only count&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure Bob had it. submitted with Typescript and was at the bottom early in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: are they shown in your company FrankR?
 FrankR: aah.. CG screws with me.. just after posing the question the board refreshes and we're at 39 out of nowhere
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized that CG creates chatrooms for your school and company
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: mine are extremely active (insert image of dead animal below cactus)
 eulerscheZahl: here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vj5421">https://prnt.sc/vj5421</a>
 Earthborne: That out-of-sync seems really random, it never happens on second attempt on same conditions
 reCurse: out of sync is easily solved by keeping input reading and output writing out of your code and only in the main loop
 Earthborne: I have
 <b>**Earthborne studies his code to make sure he has</b></p><p><img src="/a/29364943044767" /> reCurse: In case I'm not clear
 reCurse: while (true) { state = read_inputs(); action = play(state); output(action); }
 reCurse: Can't go wrong
 starmaq: finite state machines time
 reCurse: I'm starting to get the feeling this contest will end like locam
 Zenoscave: remind me how locam ended
 kovi: i have the same feeling
 reCurse: 1 point separating top 20 or 50 I think?
 Zenoscave: I can see that happening
 eulerscheZahl: same
 RoboStac: one of the cg staff was saying the out of sync message is being displayed when you timeout as well as when you go out of sync
 reCurse: This may have been better as a weekend contest
 DomiKo: how locam ended?
 eulerscheZahl: i think there isn't that much strategic depth
 eulerscheZahl: locam had a clear order at top3
 jacek: so less than a point between nothing and t-shirt?
 reCurse: clear ehhhhh
 eulerscheZahl: below it was quite random
 eulerscheZahl: you got a well deserved 2nd place
 eulerscheZahl: i saw closet better than you, sorry
 reCurse: I wasn't insinuating in that direction
 reCurse: More like the rankings felt random overall
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i hated that contest
 Zenoscave: moin
 eulerscheZahl: so, do we steal LEARNs this time? (kidding, it's more complex than drafts)
 kovi: actually i had the feeling of that
 reCurse: Yeah nowhere similar
 eulerscheZahl: your spells can't be scored alone i think. depends on the other spells you have. how well they add up
 Zenoscave: euler did you do the precompute yet
 eulerscheZahl: which precompute?
 Zenoscave: inventory 1001
 eulerscheZahl: i never planned to do so
 Zenoscave: I must've misremembered the convo
 kovi: true, combinations do matter (actualy they do in hearthstone, but not in locam)
 Maliamnon: to me, there seems to be a bit of unresolved sequencing. rest to recast a create so that your conversion can be repeated - for example
 Maliamnon: or maybe some of you are ahead of me and have figured that out&#160;:)
 thibpat: Hi everyone :wave: I'm live streaming the fall challenge in JavaScript now! Feel free to join on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 icecream17: i'm trying to combine learn cast and rest somehow
 Uemu[yazid]: Hey, I get the message "Internal error. An error report has been sent to the CodinGame team." once every couple of times, should I ignore it or is the problem from me&#160;? xd
 Presac: I think I've made a horrible mess in the fall challenge. It's sooo badly optimized.  I really don't know enough about dfs and bfs...
 Maliamnon: Presac - that's part of the fun! For me it's as much about learning as it is about doing well.
 SmolPepeL: where is fun about bot programming when it's all about machine learning...
 Maliamnon: You can do very will without ML Smol
 icecream17: I didn't do BFS or DFS, am i doing something wrong?
 SmolPepeL: yeah, like the tutorial levels, maybe. What about challenging the leaderboard 
 Presac: Well, I mostly just feel like I don't know where I'm supposed to go/look. Don't really have much experience with this.
 Cappefra: I didn't do graphs either icecream
 Tandy1000: I just started. Can I has job now?
 nan0S_: ras
 Presac: Which different methods are usually used for this?
 Cappefra: monte carlo is pretty popular
 dbf: Presac, just watch some bfs/dfs tutorial to be familiar with algo itself and then think how to represent state/do transpositions and you are done
 Presac: I mostly have a bfs/dfs, but run out of time with a depth bigger than 5
 Presac: Probably my evaluation of how good a node is that is wack.
 Earthborne: Damnit, I isolated input/output in separate functions called from the main loop, but I'm still getting out of sync
 RockyMullet: I generally don't change the input default code, to avoid messing up something
 Counterbalance: it's the first thing i rip apart
 RockyMullet: Counterbalance well I'm not as brave as you :cry:
 jke: Earthborne check for excessive newlines in output, that can cause it as well.
 Earthborne: RockyMullet things like moving delta0...3 into a list instead of 4 variables, does that break the sync?
 Braykin08: I'm getting out of sync too, didn't change the starting code
 Earthborne: No extra newlines
 starmaq: what I hate the most about python is its syntax errors 
 starmaq: I write one long line of code and it just yeets a syntax error with no additional info 
 starmaq: one long line of golf code*
 starmaq: then I spend the next 4 minutes fixing that
 Doju: My sync just broke too
 Doju: they must've changed something
 rak1507: That's why you write more than one line lol
 Earthborne: Could still be that I time out, my check on number of computations isn't all that reliable
 SmolPepeL: yeah, you always optimise the code later, that's the rule 
 starmaq: I'm not a python dude so I got used to writing a lot in a single line, but python is not super good at that it seems
 SmolPepeL: less brackets to worry about, sounds like the best language to write single lines in
 Earthborne: Oh, I just realized that I'm using DFS while I should be using BFS on the search tree, no wonder I got a C in algorithms
 starmaq: it's not as easy as you'd expect
 starmaq: when you start using lambdas
 starmaq: it's a nightmare
 Earthborne: oi
 Earthborne: Isolated input/output, now I'm getting out of sync even more often
 Counterbalance: does the game end when you get out of sync? I.e., is it a timeout?
 Counterbalance: your bot might be crashing..
 Earthborne: Nope, I get the warning and then it might play upto 50-60 turns before timing out
 Counterbalance: if i'm not mistaken, the warning is printed at the top, regardless of where it happens, so it's probably because of the timeout.
 LuckyJ.: Hey, same problem of sync here
 LuckyJ.: I reactivate all my verbose stuff for the turn it stopped to understand it but then, time out ('cause of the lost of printing)And no message for the sync anymore
 LuckyJ.: So I'm sure how the 'sync error' &lt;-&gt; 'time out' are related
 LuckyJ.: I'm not sure*
 Earthborne: If it was the bot crashing I would expect it to happen on the same place every time
 Earthborne: But now with 10 replays it happened only twice and on different turns
 Doju: I think my algo is gonna use waayy too much memory
 ProMikeSundays: i have a problem that i cant maximize the editor
 meh1001: try a different browser, or disable plugins at least and see if that helps
 ProMikeSundays: but this problem only arrived when i started using this chat feature
 roglemorph: u refresh right?
 Panagis: does java assist work?
 ProMikeSundays: ´what is java assist?
 ProMikeSundays: and yes i have refreshed, but thanks for the info roglemorph
 Panagis: "Activating Java Language Assist" for a long time&#160;:/
 roglemorph: how u do red text
 struct: java assist seems to be having problems
 rcar: type roglemorph to see red text
 Icebox: this is legit not normal
 Icebox: I wanna throw the pc out the window
 struct: why Icebox?
 Icebox: how does a piece of code that takes precisely 600ms still have around 10% of chance to timeout on turn 1
 struct: Still first turn problems?
 Icebox: yes
 Doju: Umm, what kind of structure is good for storing the possible game states?
 Doju: Just a tree?
 Icebox: I optimized the **** out of it
 Doju: Or maybe only the last level of the tree?
 Icebox: Standard Error Stream:Line 19 - 560ms 886μs
 struct: Try reporting it on discord, I doubt it will get fixed before monday though
 Icebox: how does spamming "replay in same conditions" ever make that timing out
 Icebox: time*
 reCurse: First turn includes runtime initialization and all that
 reCurse: It was never really meant to give your bot extra time
 Uljahn: same condition doesn't mean you get the same cpu i guess
 Ben_J88: if multiple output are sent in one trun, which one is registered by the system&#160;?the first one&#160;? the last one&#160;?
 reCurse: It causes desync
 struct: they stack
 Braykin08: You know what's missing from the last contest? Emojis
 reCurse: No
 MaroIsLife: :grinning:
 zahariaca: what was the command to say something&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: just append it
 struct: just add a space, REST message
 zahariaca: ah cool, thx
 Braykin08: You would append it after your command, "Move up 🍆"
 05K4R: I have quite a few battles that I lose after 7-8 turns, but they work fine when I run them in the IDE. Is performance the problem here?
 Earthborne: Sounds like the same problem I'm having 05K4R
 Earthborne: Haha, now my opponent timed out the same way
 cegprakash: bronze leaderboard too slow
 Cappefra: I'm curious, is there any of you in top 500 bronze without any tome logic? 
 AntiSquid: 4.7k already o_o
 dreadylein: @cappefra yes
 Cappefra: nice!
 Cappefra: I'm procrastinating implementing the tome :D
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Who? because dread use tome 
 Doju: I'm so confused about how the tome works
 Doju: like... is the tax shared?
 Doju: and how on earth does it work
 tomatoes: tome_index = price, tax = reward for learning
 dreadylein: ah saiksyapo isnt wrong , i dont have logic tho, just grabbing a handfull spells in the first few rounds to widen options
 AntiSquid: tome greatly increases wins without any logic 
 dreadylein: missinterpreted logic in this context i guess&#160;;)
 Cappefra: oh ok
 Cappefra: well then I guess I'll have to start by doing that too
 icecream17: i just noticed - there's nothing to learn that requires two different ingredients
 icecream17: take a look
 icecream17: * Tomespells: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/42756a51-a1ff-47a5-a938-0dea71396c8b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/42756a51-a1ff-47a5-a938-0dea71396c8b</a>

 icecream17: nevermind, somehow i didn't see the first two
 [CG]SaiksyApo: :D
 Cappefra: I was so confused there for a moment @icecream17 :D
 Maliamnon: Anyone have advice on a good timer for C#?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why would you need a -1,0,-1,1 when u have a 0,0,-1,1&#160;?
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Stopwatch
 Q12: How do you decide which Cast spell to learn?
 icecream17: well, maybe the 0, 0, -1, 1 is the 42nd learn
 Maliamnon: ty saiksy
 icecream17: Most people learn the first 10
 Zenoscave: [CG]SaiksyApo is right Maliamnon. System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch
 icecream17: You can make a usefulness grader for each learn then pick the best one
 ParticleBeam: is the tome randomly generated or are the entries always the same with different shuffling?
 Zenoscave: the latter ParticleBeam
 Q12: Thanks icecream17
 ParticleBeam: Thanks
 icecream17: You can check out the source code of this game on this GitHub repo. You can find a list of all possible spells in the tome.
 [CG]SaiksyApo: You need to start the timer after reading the first input tho

 icecream17: oh, nvm, it was already answered
 ParticleBeam: Thanks. I see the deliveries are also the same.
 Zenoscave: yup
 Ekaon: How do you guys debug all the thing&#160;? Do you only use the CodingGame ide&#160;?
 Zenoscave: currently, yes Ekaon. But there's also brutal tester
 Ekaon: Brutal tester&#160;?
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 Zenoscave: some setup is required
 DanTheMan832: Guys, what happens if both players try and buy the same thing
 struct: they both get it
 Zenoscave: both get the points
 icecream17: technical details: When both witches perform the same action, they both reap the rewards for that action. This applies namely to potion prices, the urgency bonus, the read-ahead tax, and learning spells.
 DanTheMan832: ok thanks guys
 icecream17: aw, my copy and paste is so slow compared to typing
 Zenoscave: lol icecream17
 roglemorph: do I have to wait with the test for arena open
 roglemorph: and its gonna take awhile
 GetSchwifty: where does the bronze boss usually end up; top 10% gets through to silver? or does bronze use a predefined boss ..
 struct: Usually top 40%
 GetSchwifty: nice
 struct: bot there are a lot of players on bronze
 struct: so it might be a little bit lower
 icecream17: phew, i'm probably good
 struct: But I think 40% is quite high for this contest
 GetSchwifty: roglemorph, what league are ya in?
 sparky: just had to implement WAIT, but if you have to wait you've already lost&#160;:/
 rcar: REST &gt; WAIT
 roglemorph: bronze
 RockyMullet: a little table flip to get the tie<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/501489913">https://www.codingame.com/replay/501489913</a>
 Doju: Oh hey my witch is finally doing things
 Earthborne: :clap:
 GetSchwifty: roglemorph - you can start test in arena whenever you want, but silver league will only open up in 2 days
 Doju: Although this is still heuristics
 Doju: and crappy ones at that
 icecream17: my usefullness for learning things is way too complicated
 RockyMullet: icecream17 once you have simulation it because pretty clear, since you can simulate using it the next turn
 AntiSquid: top 50%, it was like top 30% or less for pacman :P
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll nice
 RockyMullet: hello AntiSquid from the past
 Barimehdi77: is there is any spell that doesn't have an action_id?
 AntiSquid: hello mullet and human attached to it
 RockyMullet: I'll be sad to learn that we still don't have flying cars in this distant futur
 RockyMullet: you'll * damn
 RockyMullet: Barimehdi77 they all have an id
 Doug: @RockyMullet Orlando is building the first Flying-Car Hub in the US, FYI
 Earthborne: Wow, decreased number of computed gameStates and jumpet on the leaderboard, I guess it was actually my code timing out:P
 AntiSquid: there are flying cars for years now, but none like the ones from the movie
 dreadylein: mh&#160;?
 Barimehdi77: i'm trying to sort all the potions using there price (highest to the lower) put when i'm printing this own id I get this 
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/217980f2-69c7-4144-9c48-26504bd87472">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/217980f2-69c7-4144-9c48-26504bd87472</a>
 Icebox: AntiSquid flying cars, or planes that look like cards?
 Barimehdi77: this is where i have the problem
 Barimehdi77: i = 5 price = 3 id = -1457670072
 Icebox: cars*
 AntiSquid: hybrids? :P
 Icebox: nah
 rcar: are you sure that one is a potion, Barimehdi77?
 Doju: I now have a hopefully working gamestate system
 Doju: now for the hard part...
 Icebox: we have a lot of car-ish looking planes, but no flying cars yet
 Icebox: all planes have wheels AntiSquid, that doesn't make them flying cars either
 reCurse: Always thought 'flying cars' was about 'flying for private use'
 struct: flying cars that need an airstrip to land are not cars to me
 Icebox: yeah exactly struct
 Donotalo: bug fixed only to find out there are more bugs&#160;:(
 Doju: I reckon BFS until time runs out is gonna be a valid option for now?
 Doju: or actually i guess it's a flood fill
 Barimehdi77: rcar: yeap cuz I store all The data in actions so I send them to a func who sort them
 Braykin08: A flying car is basically just a drone
 Earthborne: Floodfill until time runs out is gonna do Doju, just not actually let the time run out like I'm doing:P
 geppoz: how do you put the logo on your school or company?
 Doju: haha :D thanks Earthborne, I'm gonnat try to do that now
 AntiSquid: do cars with wind turbines count&#160;? they can lift up somewhat vertically
 rcar: Barimehdi not all actions are potions though. there's only 5 potions available at any given time
 Earthborne: Doju while I'm going to rewrite to use bfs
 Doju: I have a feeling that the tree is gonna blow up immediately if it's not pruned at all but whatever, lets give it a shot
 cegprakash: why do I see lot of "may" in problem statement
 cegprakash: The first spell in the list "may" be learnt freely.
 Maliamnon: you'd prefer April?
 Earthborne: My fear when doing naive floodfill is that I'll waste all the time following a worthless path
 Doju: if i do this:
 wlesavo: ceg reading statement instead of asking in chat :scream:
 Doju: [func(x) for x in x_list if func(x)]
 Doju: will func(x) be calculated twice or is python smart enough to only do it once?
 Zenoscave: twice
 Earthborne: yep, i guess twice
 Doju: okay, thanks
 DeCe: you can do something like y=f(x) for x in list if y
 Earthborne: no automatic memoization
 Maliamnon: won the first 25 straight after submit, i think tha's a new PB
 Zenoscave: DeCe in python not sure if delegated assignment works that way
 Zenoscave: may be wrong
 Remus_: What would happen if I had 0 tier-0 ingredients when learning tomeIndex = 1 and taxCount = 1?Would I get it or is it a bad action?
 Illedan: reCurse  05:26PMThis may have been better as a weekend contestAgreed!
 Earthborne: Wouldn't that be where&#160;:= comes into play?
 DeCe: Zenoscave I think i read that in new 3.8 features
 Doju: oh really DeCe? that's exactly what i need. thanks
 struct: Remus_ bad action
 Zenoscave: yeah 3.8 has the walrus
 Remus_: thanks
 Earthborne: but is CG using 3.8?
 Topjimmies: somehow my random action bot is better than my optimized one
 Remus_: You were lucky then
 Zenoscave: Earthborne it uses 3.7.4
 Maliamnon: Or you're optimizing for the wrong thing&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Topjimmies: or my "optimization" isn't actually good
 Earthborne: So no walrus yet then
 Zenoscave: nope
 Donotalo: leaving my bot at rank 250, going to sleep
 Q12: From when the response time start? from the beginning of the while loop (before inputs) or after receiving the inputs?
 Zenoscave: after reading the first input
 lambrosk: So if i understand correctly
 Zenoscave: is the best estimate. but any Preemptive OS will be not precise
 lambrosk: to add tax to a spell i simply increase tax count? 
 Q12: after reading this variable: actionCount?
 HolyLoremIpsum_c4e6: anyone knows which C complier are they using here/.
 Counterbalance: ^ see the link to the faq
 Zenoscave: Q12 yes. Iambrosk yes

 Zenoscave: HolyLoremIpsum_c4e6 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 HolyLoremIpsum_c4e6: ohh thanks
 Zenoscave: yw np
 Q12: how do I append message to my command? I just need to put space and then my message?
 Remus_: Interesting, first time running my AI. It says best possible score at depth 5 is 969289844. Magnificent!
 RockyMullet: Remus you should win all games with that score :smile:
 Bobbadillio: That sounds like a big score!
 aCat: or an overflow :joy_cat:
 Andy176822: I'm getting a strange result where my bot gets 60, the opposition 58.  But in the final score card is shows that the opposition got 64 and beat me&#160;???
 Maliamnon: you get points for inventory at the end andy
 Andy176822: ohhhhh
 aCat: you have bonus for materials of tier &gt; 0
 Andy176822: I didn't know that
 Maliamnon: Anything more than level 0 counts for 1 point
 Andy176822: thank you very much
 RockyMullet: you can steal some wins here and tehre by detecting that your opponent is about to brew their 6th potion and just try to full your inventory
 dbf: I've just implemented a code that detects last move and trade resources to get final bonus. Works like a charm: instead of 71-41 a lost just 71-42

 eulerscheZahl: oops
 Maliamnon: lol dbg
 Maliamnon: dbf*
 Nerchio: and i was fixing bug for 2 hours
 Nerchio: instead of doing shallow copy i was copying the list reference
 Nerchio: :x
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl yeah, I feel I have a week to convert my depth to in depth N, so I'm lazy
 RockyMullet: depth 2* in a depth N
 RockyMullet: I doubt I'll make it legend and I'm pretty sur depth N will be good enough for gold, so I wasting time on the chat instead of coding
 Nerchio: i think good bfs(or whatever search) with some nice heuristics will be able to make legend
 Nerchio: but we will see :p
 RockyMullet: yeah, I doubt mine will be "good" lol
 eulerscheZahl: i still need those heuristics
 RockyMullet: I'll likely do a bfs for my search
 eulerscheZahl: and more depth!!!!
 Nerchio: plenty of time for t hat
 RockyMullet: I'm curious to see how deep I can go, I feel it's not really perf heavy
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl you going like depth 6-7&#160;?
 Nerchio: i started with bfs although i want to do some beam search maybe later
 eulerscheZahl: this contest is a CPU masterrace
 Nerchio: but i had some bugs and now i got tired xD
 eulerscheZahl: see my messages RockyMullet

 RockyMullet: yeah, I watched a game I sadly lost against you and noticed the message
 RockyMullet: oh some depth 11 in there
 eulerscheZahl: outliners
 RockyMullet: is it only based on avoiding timeouts or do you some times stop before&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: just time
 RockyMullet: kk
 ParticleBeam: So many nodes...
 Maliamnon: so is the time we're judged on starting after we parse inputs?
 struct: after 1st input
 aCat: euler it's wide search or some beam?
 eulerscheZahl: :zipper_mouth:
 wlesavo: damn euler comes up with a killing move
 cegprakash: what is that extension that shows the rank of all players in battle list
 cegprakash: CG spunk?
 eulerscheZahl: stop analyzing me wlesavo
 aCat: oh I mean full search
 Zenoscave: ah
 wlesavo: you started it :smiley:
 reCurse: C#?
 aCat: like not cutting the moves 
 Zenoscave: wlesavo stop analyzing ever?
 struct: I would start porting to c++ euler
 eulerscheZahl: might be a good idea
 Zenoscave: Yes euler port to c++
 eulerscheZahl: but you know i'm stubborn
 Zenoscave: I'll stay c#
 eulerscheZahl: you want to win the language?
 eulerscheZahl: then convert to D
 Zenoscave: I already won a language. Just want to be first in C# specifically
 Zenoscave: of course if you leave it's a hollow win... so no actually stay on c#
 cegprakash: why no one vote for me on who wins fall challenge poll
 reCurse: Rhetorical question?
 Bobbadillio: I haven't voted at all, and who are you?
 Zenoscave: there's a poll?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-who-will-win-the-fall-challenge-2020/187257">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-who-will-win-the-fall-challenge-2020/187257</a>
 eulerscheZahl: automaton is so overrated
 struct: I changed my vote
 cegprakash: looks like someone just voted for eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: how to change vote
 Zenoscave: My money is on emil. Strong for a newcommer
 struct: press show vote ceg
 cegprakash: okay voted for eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i voted negligence. statistically it seems the most likely option
 cegprakash: who is negligence
 WINWINWIN: He means someone thats not on the list
 eulerscheZahl: can't copy the full text
 cegprakash: yeah that includes me
 cegprakash: that gives me hope
 cegprakash: i just want to see diagrams of eulerscheZahl and his debugging tools
 cegprakash: so just voted for eulerscheZahl
 struct: new automaton?
 eulerscheZahl: 2020?
 eulerscheZahl: that's from dbdr, for the chat history
 Zenoscave: Other than Linq Concat is there a fast way to concat IEnumerables?
 Zenoscave: Maybe separate loop unrolling needed here
 eulerscheZahl: i opted for separate loops
 eulerscheZahl: hm, Concat is probably better than the Union I used
 NickTheFirst: Hey guys, Im trying the Fall Challenge and i have come to a position where the code im running in my Visual Studio gives me the correct result but when i put it in the Coding Game it messes up the results. Is there any quick tips on what it may go wrong (i have removed and copy pasted the whole code 10 times already
 Zenoscave: Union is awfully slow. def change to concat euler
 Zenoscave: yw
 Zenoscave: NickTheFirst Could be timeout related? 
 cegprakash: what is the difference between a normal spell and tome spell
 cegprakash: what's the meaning of tome
 Nerchio: Nick you don't tell us what is the error :P
 eulerscheZahl: 2 loops is fast enough :P
 Zenoscave: CEG READ THE INSTRUCTIONS
 eulerscheZahl: do we have a a marco for that yet?
 Zenoscave: we should
 Zenoscave: :rtfm_ceg:
 Zenoscave: :book:
 Astrobytes: A marco eh? :P
 NickTheFirst: @Zenoscave what is the time limit that we need to run the code&#160;? is there an easy way to test for that&#160;? @Nerchio the output is not the same. Meaning in my vs i get 17 steps and in Coding Game i get 1
 andrefpoliveira: Well I guess I will give up on C# and return to Python xD
 meh1001: A "tome" is a big book. Maybe that's what they mean. "Tome spell" = spell you get from reading  a big book
 eulerscheZahl: what appears to be the problem with C#?
 andrefpoliveira: The problem is me :joy:
 Zenoscave: 1S for the first turn and 50ms after
 andrefpoliveira: Im just more used to Python xD
 Zenoscave: 1 sec
 Zenoscave: stick with C# there's no better time to learn than right now
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i totally agree
 andrefpoliveira: Hmm

 VizGhar: how many kuds u have? :D
 Nerchio: 1 kid per multi
 Illedan: I did rewrite big parts of it last weekend
 Astrobytes: Yeah, doing work in the house is no excuse for the lack of app
 Astrobytes: :P
 VizGhar: i have less then 1hr  for this&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't supposed to refactor. patch it and ship it
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I wanted better features
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 Illedan: You'll see
 Illedan: going to be legendary
 eulerscheZahl: gotta wait till friday for legend
 cegprakash: I don't understand tomeIndex and taxCount when learning spell
 zapakh: tomeIndex is what you pay, taxCount is what you get back
 cegprakash: if I learn a spell I'll gain ingredients?
 _Lupus_: tomeindex is how much you pay for it, taxCount is what you get out of it
 Zenoscave: rtfm ceg
 _Lupus_: the taxes both players pay are placed on spells in the tome. the one(s) who learn it get these ingredients
 cegprakash: red ahead tax means?
 cegprakash: I need to pay rupees?
 _Lupus_: no, tier-0 ingredients
 _Lupus_: it's in the rule description&#160;;)
 cegprakash: what happens to the tax
 cegprakash: can I get it back
 Astrobytes: Read it laddie!
 cegprakash: so basically if inv0 &gt;= tomeIndex I can learn the spell
 cegprakash: right?
 zapakh: Yes
 mojojojo: and is the read ahead tax automatically applied when I try to learn a spell which is not the first?
 _Lupus_: yes
 mojojojo: ok thanks
 eulerscheZahl: you have to pay first and get a refund from the tax
 cegprakash: refund?
 cegprakash: :o
 eulerscheZahl: if you can'T afford the initial bid, you don't get it
 G_Gre: hello
 cegprakash: bid?
 eulerscheZahl: refund: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4PllvUowaQ&amp;ab_channel=JimBrowning">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4PllvUowaQ&amp;ab_channel=JimBrowning</a>
 _Lupus_: dude, read the instructions :D
 cegprakash: are they even in prob statement?
 struct: Will never know if you dont read it
 _Lupus_: yes, assuming you have reached a league where these rules apply&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ceg never reads the statement, it's his hallmark
 cegprakash: I read every line
 cegprakash: I never saw bid or refund
 struct: ahah
 struct: You read the chat statement
 eulerscheZahl: looking at it doesn't mean reading it
 mojojojo: what if opponent and I try to learn a spell higher up together? Both of   our tier-0 money is on the line?
 cegprakash: and I don't understand any statement that contains a tax in it
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: let's report ceg to the IRS
 Hurda: Hi in Javascript what is the way to get current tme in millies?
 _Lupus_: You learn from the tome, you have to pay blue ingredients for it (unless it's the first spell). The tax is distribute across all tome spells with lower index than the one you learned
 cegprakash: higher spell :o
 eulerscheZahl: are you high?
 cegprakash: okay so first spell is free
 mojojojo: high on blue ingredient pills
 cegprakash: all the time?
 _Lupus_: If the spell you learn has blue ingredients on it, you get them to the inventory, provided that you have room for them
 cegprakash: I saw may be free
 cegprakash: so I was confused
 cegprakash: is the first spell always free?
 Uljahn: no
 struct: the first spell on tome
 Uljahn: it cost 0
 _Lupus_: yes, the first spell is always free
 _Lupus_: So if you want you can spend 42 turns learning stuff for free. When the tome is empty, it's empty
 cegprakash: okay what does it mean by bidding
 cegprakash: lets say I go for 2nd spell first
 cegprakash: so I need to pay 1 t0 ingredient?
 cegprakash: will I get it this turn itself
 cegprakash: or I've to wait?
 Astrobytes: jeez
 _Lupus_: you get it immediately and can use it next turn
 _Lupus_: it's not an auction. Whoever wrote bid meant "pay"
 cegprakash: okay so there is no bidding
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl confused me
 Astrobytes: Let him figure it out like the rest of us!
 cegprakash: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and that's why you read the statement and don't listen to the chat
 Astrobytes: ceg, you're a good guy but I wish you'd figure things out on your own for once!!!
 cegprakash: hey
 cegprakash: I read
 cegprakash: and can't get
 cegprakash: I either ask
 struct: Also dont forget to read the part where you trade rupees
 cegprakash: or just stare
 Astrobytes: Check the code!
 cegprakash: I stared for 2 hrs
 eulerscheZahl: rupee trading is a game changer
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Scarfield: to be fair, the statement isnt that clear&#160;:) but you do have a reputation in this regard ceggy :p
 cegprakash: nope
 cegprakash: it's not clear to me
 cegprakash: if it's clear for u
 cegprakash: does not mean it's clear for everybody
 struct: Its not clear
 struct: But you do this every contest
 cegprakash: tax is usually what ppl pay to govt.
 Astrobytes: No it's not that clear, but you can check the code
 cegprakash: in this game why the witch gains tax
 cegprakash: its just weird
 cegprakash: naming
 struct: ok...
 Scarfield: yea taxes isnt usually paid back to costumers :D
 mojojojo: i'd like the govt to pay me tax too
 Astrobytes: that's what rebates are for
 Braykin08: That sortof the point of tax, they 'should' go back to the community
 Astrobytes: They seldom do 
 mojojojo: only if the tax paid in game gave me more milliseconds...
 mojojojo: rich would keep getting rich
 mojojojo: realistic
 Astrobytes: lol
 HungryBurger: Does anyone know if it's possible to turn off Language Assist? I haven't been able to find an option yet.
 zapakh: There was a user script floating around to hide the popup elements, but it hasn't been working for me
 Scarfield: on the extra milliseconds part, i thought couldnt you make a CG game, where it was possible to output "still thinking", then opponent gets a turn to think as well, but will only be allowed to output "still thinking", since its still the first players turn to move. Couldnt this achive a possibillity of a time bank on CG?
 HungryBurger: Oh, haha, so they added a feature that you can't turn off?&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: a complicated one. you still have to be responsive to claim that extra time
 mojojojo: implementing that part in game backend would probably be difficult
 Scarfield: yea, but at least it seems possible? never made a contribution, so i have no idea if it would work
 mojojojo: or on second thought, maybe not. it's just a new command which tells interpreter to skip the turn
 mojojojo: but user program state is destroyed each turn I assume
 eulerscheZahl: it would work but i don't think it's a userexperience worth implementing
 mojojojo: i agree
 Scarfield: well i have seen people here mentioning having a possiblility of a time bank in games could be nice. Had the idea for a work around and wanted to share it&#160;:)
 andrefpoliveira: Hey guys I would like some piece of advise if anyone want and could help&#160;:) I'm new to C# and trying some BFS. But obviously, using new everytime is not useful. But neither is creating an array of States and then initiallizing all... Any help on how to optimize this? No problem if it something I should not ask xD Just say so
 Doju: bugs
 Doju: bugs everywhere
 Majeck: Fix one bug and three more appear
 andrefpoliveira: Its like hydra
 struct: I dont know C#, but on c++ I just allocate memory I will need at the start
 andrefpoliveira: That was my idea but is very slow...
 struct: By start I mean first turn
 andrefpoliveira: Yeah yeah same
 struct: Its still slow, even after allocating?
 jacek: you get 1s in first turn
 Astrobytes: ~1s
 HungryBurger: @Majeck - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.developermemes.com/2014/12/17/grumpy-cat-patching-bugs-developer-meme/">http://www.developermemes.com/2014/12/17/grumpy-cat-patching-bugs-developer-meme/</a>
 andrefpoliveira: Maybe 1000 is too much for an array?
 Astrobytes: (that's a tilde if you can't see it btw)
 struct: Whats the size of each?
 andrefpoliveira: Hmm Im using a class
 andrefpoliveira: Not sure of the size
 Counterbalance: you have 768mb so i doubt that's a problem
 Counterbalance: could it be that you're not setting 'visited' when you add a neighbour but only when you process that node?
 andrefpoliveira: I was not marking them as visited actually...
 Majeck: Lol
 andrefpoliveira: I was considering that a state will only pass once
 andrefpoliveira: Maybe that is dumb
 Astrobytes: That *could* be a problem :P
 andrefpoliveira: AHAHAH
 andrefpoliveira: Yap maybe
 jacek: oO
 andrefpoliveira: But like... if you remove them from the queue they wont happen again no?
 AntiSquid: "LEARN id: your witch attemps to learn the tome spell with the given id. " small mistake but ...
 Scarfield: if you dont consider them visited, what will stop them from being added to the queue again?&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: yeah that's one way to do it, if you don't add anything back to that queue (like when exploring neighbours)
 andrefpoliveira: Hmm okok then I need to make an override of the equals probably
 andrefpoliveira: Tyy
 eulerscheZahl: class State&#160;: IEquatable&lt;State&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: then implement Equals(State) and GetHashCode()
 nurit: what happen in a tie?
 nurit: in the fall challenge
 Xenoid: Ties are ties
 sirsatan: both 1st places
 nurit: ok thx
 sirsatan: but chance is very low for tie
 Xenoid: it's a low chance but they do happen
 geppoz: lol my bot choosed to learn [-1,0,-1,+1] , when he has the default one [0,0,-1,+1] that is already better :D
 zapakh: Yeah but now he can cast both without a rest in between
 Nerchio: there is [-1,0,-1,+1]?
 Nerchio: i will hardcode to never take it XD
 geppoz: yes there is :D

 Nerchio: yea i know thanks
 Nerchio: soon i will try to evaluate them :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someone pasted this earlier:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/42756a51-a1ff-47a5-a938-0dea71396c8b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/42756a51-a1ff-47a5-a938-0dea71396c8b</a>
 HungryBurger: Use every part of the ingredient.
 geppoz: tbh there is a difference, that is repeatable, but my bot dont yet use that
 jacek: also sometimes you want to free your inventory
 Nerchio: i'd argue that's pretty niche
 xSkyline: Hi guys, I'm new here. Can you break your bot into multiple files here in the IDE&#160;?
 jacek: no
 struct: no but there are extensions to sync file with IDE
 Nerchio: in the IDE no that's why people who visit the site more often code outside the IDE and have some merging scripts
 xSkyline: Thanks&#160;! I guess I'll google around for something for Visual Studio
 Fox787: yeah i'll have to look at how to merge java files. I've just been coding one class instead of multiple
 struct: Skyline I use this one for c++ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MarcosCosmos/cg-cpp-bundler">https://github.com/MarcosCosmos/cg-cpp-bundler</a>
 struct: Whenever I build I run that python script
 xSkyline: Thanks, I'll check it out
 xSkyline: mindless prototyping in a single file gets old really quick.
 xSkyline: now I can mindlessly prototype in multiple files&#160;!
 mojojojo: is there a Python bundler like this one?
 struct: I don't know
 ClockSort: i haven't been bundling in VS (C#) and I'm at 500 lines. Haha
 Astrobytes: should be trivial enough to write a python merger in python no?
 mojojojo: yeah but i thought let's not reinvent the wheel
 HungryBurger: I use bash to glue files together. But you have to be familiar with  cat, xargs, and piping.
 Doju: ClockSort, my python file (single file, written all in the codingame IDE) was 1k lines long :D
 Doju: for the spring challenge
 Doju: Oh no
 Doju: why is this bug back
 struct: No bugs yet
 Doju: this is doesn't help at all
 struct: Havent started coded though
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5e95956f-8ab9-420d-b7ab-a7de0a8de8f2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5e95956f-8ab9-420d-b7ab-a7de0a8de8f2</a>
 struct: coding*
 Astrobytes: I have a bug in my motivation :P
 Nerchio: in chat the whole day haven't started coding :D
 Nerchio: nice one struct
 Astrobytes: I was busy today, that's my excuse
 Astrobytes: But probably won't start til Monday tbh
 cegprakash: oh now I see tax refund :D
 cegprakash: implemented learn
 Astrobytes: lol
 cegprakash: but I've some bug on 40th turn
 Bobbadillio: I frequently encountered a bug last night. It was a box elder bug, and it kept crawling back onto me for some reason. I ran into the same bug this morning, and dropped it outside.
 cegprakash: I'm trying to learn a skill with wrong ID
 Astrobytes: Fix it
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's not a bug, it's a feature
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 Astrobytes: lol Bobbadillio
 Bobbadillio: happy to entertain&#160;:)
 jthemphill: does anyone have a C++ macro that would make writing hash/equality functions less tedious?
 jthemphill: i'm thiiis close to switching back to Rust just for `#[derive(Eq, Hash)]`
 Bobbadillio: gotta admit, I love the derives. When I get to choose my own crates, there's a derive_more crate that lets you derive add too, I think, which is shockingly useful
 jthemphill: yeah it's great
 Bobbadillio: Looks like I'm out of wood 1!
 Bobbadillio: or about to be
 Doju: gratz :D
 Doju: oh no
 Doju: deepcopy doesn't like my GameState class
 ClockSort: I wote my own deep copy :P
 Bobbadillio: Any clue what your deepcopy is doing wrong?
 HungryBurger: Bobbadillio is almost out of the woods.
 Doju: It's not passing all the arguments to a constructor
 Doju: ew__() missing 3 required positional arguments: 'b', 'c', and 'd'
 Doju: that's __new__()
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: 2 hours of trying to make code use bitboards and it is slower -.-
 struct: next try avx
 Bobbadillio: bitboards for the fall challenge, or something else?
 cegprakash: this error is weird :o
 Illedan: ye
 cegprakash: may be c++ fast IO
 Astrobytes: It's fine, you have until 6am Illedan, don't worry :P
 Bobbadillio: Huh, what does a bitboard look like for the fall challenge?
 Doju: oh my god
 cegprakash: there is only 1 learn in input but somehow I traverse learn command twice :o
 Illedan: 0b000_0000_0000_000_0000_0000
 Doju: aahh why did i do this this way
 Illedan: Then replace the 0 with 1 as needed
 Illedan: xD
 struct: lol
 Doju: What even is a bitboard o.o
 Illedan: Astrobytes, no sleep until 1st
 Astrobytes: :D
 Bobbadillio: That appears to be a 5 byte bitboard? gotta admit, I'm confused
 Doju: huh, that's some fancy thing
 Illedan: I'll accept being above euler though
 Doju: you really want all the performance that silicon is gonna give you
 Bobbadillio: Doju, a bitboard is a binary representation of game state, usually indicating where things are.
 Illedan: Thx bobba
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Bobbadillio: So like, in chess you can have a 64 bit type that stores a 1 or 0 for each square where a pawn is or isn't
 Illedan: I tried to keep the inventory as a bitboard
 Doju: Oh, I see
 Bobbadillio: Fair enough, order doesn't matter of the bitboard, right? But you could still do it?
 Astrobytes: what went wrong Illedan? 
 Illedan: On 10 million operations the array is on avreage 1 ms faster.
 Bobbadillio: (order of the bitboard in THIS challenge, don't let what I said confuse you Doju, the order of bits VERY much matters for chess/go/tictactoe etc)
 Doju: Right, bobbadillio. gotcha
 Astrobytes: Ah, intrinsics needed
 cegprakash: oh shit
 struct: _mm256_set1_epi8()
 cegprakash: the bug was
 cegprakash: const int MAX_SPELLS = 20;
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/17144/parallelism-on-single-core-with--net-c-and-simd-avx--first-example-">https://tech.io/playgrounds/17144/parallelism-on-single-core-with--net-c-and-simd-avx--first-example-</a>
 Illedan: Trying this now
 Doju: I'll just make a class inherit list instead of tuple somewhere deep within my code and hope nothing breaks...
 struct: good luck Illedan 
 Zenoscave: euler you have timeouts
 Illedan: He is sleeping
 Zenoscave: bah
 Illedan: But wait 1 hour and he might wake up
 Illedan: xD
 struct: he is online on discord though?
 Astrobytes: Doju: exploring bitboards where order matters visually:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cinnamonchess.altervista.org/bitboard_calculator/Calc.html">http://cinnamonchess.altervista.org/bitboard_calculator/Calc.html</a>
 Zenoscave: fair enough lol
 struct: Illedan are you really going to try avx?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: I have used some time to try and structure my models to give it any sense
 Illedan: none found
 Astrobytes: Ask him again during the week struct :P
 Bobbadillio: If you write "compiler friendly" code, won't C++ compilers use avx for you?
 Zenoscave: not sure but I don't think always
 Illedan: My code is friendly. I have variable names like:var compiler_rocks = 42;var looking_good_today = new int[4];
 Illedan: Didn't help&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: you can enable auto-vectorization yeah, but oftentimes if you really need SIMD stuff you have to do it manually
 Astrobytes: Illedan :rofl:
 Psyho: not without any optimization flags (I assume CG is still without -O2/-O3?)
 Bobbadillio: Yeah, and nobody wants to contort their code until the compiler gets satisfied anyway. No way, CG has to have O2/O3, doesn't it?
 Scarfield: var dontForgetToBringATowel
 Astrobytes: nope, gotta use The Pragmas
 Psyho: If you're using SIMD manually, you can quite often use it in more creative ways (there are few operations that are non-trivial to use)
 struct: When I tried AVX on csb I got around 2mill sims
 Scarfield: Psyho, you know about these:
 jacek: Ofast plx
 Astrobytes: that should be for Bobbadillio Scarfield, I think psyho knows
 Psyho: yeah, I know, but I'm not sure if this translates to producing auto-vectorized code
 jacek: pragmafield
 Scarfield: oh, chat scrolled, or im just blind :p
 Astrobytes: gotta specify avx, avx2 or whatever you're using
 Bobbadillio: Yeah, I had no idea you C++ folks had to deal with that :D I've sort of wished I could get some control over compiler flags as a rust competitor
 Bobbadillio: And I REALLY want to get access to 1.46 (I think?) which introduced more features to the Rust constexpr equivalent
 struct: cg takes a while to update languages
 cegprakash: submitted first version of my code with LEARN
 Psyho: I honestly don't remember what was the reason for not having optimization flags set for c++ (maybe decent msgs in the editor?)
 Psyho: but we could always have "c++ release / c++ debug" modes
 Astrobytes: *specify using #pragma GCC target ("avx2") for example
 Astrobytes: I can't remember either
 cegprakash: omg 39 turns eulerscheZahl ends the game :o
 Astrobytes: It's not like we get decent messages in the IDE anyway lol
 cegprakash: I shouldn't test against eulerscheZahl
 icecream17: =O i won the first 10 games
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501835850">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501835850</a> 39 turns isn't hard
 Psyho: btw, does anyone know memory limit?
 Xenoid: 786MB
 Zenoscave: 768MB
 Astrobytes: 768
 Xenoid: err 768MB
 Zenoscave: c-c-c-combo breaker
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: Finish Him!
 Zenoscave: FATALITY
 Astrobytes: that's jacek's line :P
 Psyho: huh, I got a crash with 64MB so I guess it's not a memory limit :D
 Zenoscave: timeout perhaps psycho
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: but I'm sure you're aware of that
 xSkyline: How do the leagues work&#160;? do they segregate coders based on results&#160;?
 icecream17: beat a boss in a league to move on to the next one
 icecream17: silver isn't open, so there's no boss in bronze yetr
 HungryBurger: Hey help ease you into the game. Rather than overwhelm you with all the game rules at once, they help you focus on a few rules at a time.
 Psyho: I get "collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status" so I guess it's memory limit
 Scarfield: segfault mayhaps?
 xSkyline: So if I'm currently in the bronze league does this mean I beat a boss&#160;? did this happen when I clicked test in arena&#160;?
 Xenoid: Yes, and yes
 Scarfield: you have leagued up from wood 2 to wood 1, and from there to bronze
 Psyho: I believe it means it doesn't even compile&#160;:)
 xSkyline: Thanks&#160;!
 icecream17: Dim Sum Saying beat me first, in this ...weird game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501839707">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501839707</a>
 Psyho: too much static memory probably
 Zenoscave: Yeah are you allocating a huge 1M array?
 Psyho: more like 64MB, but yeah
 Zenoscave: that's blocked me before Don't remember the size limit
 Scarfield: can static memory be a problem, how?
 Zenoscave: Compiler will refuse if it heap sprays
 cegprakash: omg my win rate looks crazy
 cegprakash: :o
 Scarfield: interesting, i should look under the hood some more soon&#160;:)
 cegprakash: finally I'm searchable on cgstats

 Astrobytes: we believe you ceg, you don't always have to go on about it and provide proof lol
 cegprakash: it's not proof
 cegprakash: bragging
 Astrobytes: no s**t :P
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: What I most appreciate about ceg is his honesty :D
 DomiKo: Euler top1
 Zenoscave: It's a good character trait.
 DomiKo: nice one
 cegprakash: yeah eulerscheZahl #1
 cegprakash: everyone change ur votes to eulerscheZahl if u haven't yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm voting for DefaultAI
 cegprakash: see we all code all night
 Scarfield: votes?
 struct: stop the count!
 cegprakash: what's the use of coding if we can't brag
 cegprakash: CEG for bronze boss!!
 Bobbadillio: To develop systems that foster the development of humanity!
 cegprakash: I've never been the boss
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't want to be the boss
 BenjaminUrquhart: and to make sure I'm not the boss I use debug messages
 Psyho: hmmm, I have ~50%+ winrate against euler (I run ~50 games), something is fishy 
 Psyho: or maybe I just have to wait 
 pb4:&#160;?
 struct: League is too big to know which bot is stronger
 pb4: Are you surprised you don't have the same score&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Trueskill variance is huge here
 Psyho: nah, not really, there's obv huge variance
 cegprakash: Psyho let the progress complete
 Psyho: and there's still some RPS
 pb4: 1 score difference isn't huge and 50 games isn't either
 Psyho: 1.0 is like 6 games
 Psyho: just getting impatient after fixing a silly bug, that's all :D
 pb4: :D
 pb4: At least it's not the kind of fix where your ranking drops 50 places :D
 DomiKo: Friday Friday 
 Psyho: the bug was super silly, essentially I didn't take into account prices of potions
 Psyho: and somehow I was still hovering near top 10
 cegprakash: omg psyho is red :o
 cegprakash: in tc
 cegprakash: he gonna rekt us all
 cegprakash: :D
 Astrobytes: you don't know of psyho?
 DomiKo: tc?
 Psyho: topcoder
 Nerchio: damn top23 is all C++ except like 2 ppl
 cegprakash: yes I just checked ur handle to double confirm :D
 Nerchio: or rust
 Psyho: well, now it's 2 points :sweat_smile:
 cegprakash: Zenoscave what did u do top 100
 cegprakash: omg
 Zenoscave: I've been top 50 most of today.
 Astrobytes: Read the statement properly :P
 Zenoscave: Fixed something big
 Zenoscave: Looking for top 20 with this
 Marcelo-Hackerman: what do i do to be the top 1?
 Astrobytes: Wreck the leaderboard
 Zenoscave: Yeah Reading is the biggest help at first
 Marcelo-Hackerman: why am i top 2 million
 cegprakash: win 70% games against top 10 @Marcelo-Hackerman
 struct: lol
 struct: you win 70% against evey one in top 10?
 cegprakash: lol that's all time ranking @Marcelo-Hackerman everyone starts from 0 in every contest
 struct: Hi missread
 struct: sorry
 cegprakash: that rank doesn't matter
 cegprakash: there are only around 5000 ppl in this contest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, game ends at 6 potions
 Zenoscave: PatrickMcGinnisII Hi slowpoke
 Astrobytes: omg Paddy's caffeine has worn off :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I couldn't code last night, too many Mojitos
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just now got my simple search working
 cegprakash: Zenoscave u crash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501854850">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501854850</a>
 Zenoscave: thanks ceg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, i didn't realize finding a brewable would be so easy... under 80 nodes in bfs to find first available
 zapakh: Now find another one
 icecream17: the matches are already around 40-50 turns, i wonder how many turns it will eventually take....
 Q12: Do I need to leave the computer open if I did test in arena?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 Zenoscave: no Q12
 Q12: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, since I totally overdid it, but adding learn and cast x shouldn't be as hard now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, I'm WAY behind
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least i can randomly beat default ai
 PatrickMcGinnisII: c'mon leaderboard, big $
 BenjaminUrquhart: changing my debug messages makes me lose against default AI most of the time despite having no impact on the game
 BenjaminUrquhart: the hell is that
 ClockSort: Use "replay in same conditions"
 Majeck: I know the feeling BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's what I'm doing
 Waffle3z: does it start with a number
 Majeck: Debug messages take a lot of time to process though
 ClockSort: the problem is probably between your computer and your chair
 BenjaminUrquhart: Waffle3z I made sure it doesn't by putting the message in brackets
 Astrobytes: See my profile
 Maliamnon: Aren't they all ClockSort?
 Doju: oh my god
 Doju: it doesn't crash instantly!
 Majeck: And the opponent could have a random (non-deterministic) algo
 Majeck: A classic case of PEBCOC
 icecream17: PEBCOC?
 Doju: oh my god
 Doju: it actually works
 Maliamnon: PEBKAC is what i always saw
 woosal: a literal brain storm
 Majeck: Same as PEBKAC but with different initials
 Doju: I must be missing something... Simulating to depth 10 atm with no issues
 geppoz: you switched to c++&#160;?
 Doju: nope, still python
 Doju: yeah something is definitely wrong, it's doing depth 100 with no issues hahah
 Astrobytes: seems legit
 Doju: python so stronk
 Doju:&#160;:-d
 BenjaminUrquhart: can it do 1000
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Battles in progress 32% ... hmm, when does silver open?
 Doju: hahah now my bot is just haording spells
 Xenoid: Silver opens on the 16th
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501866402">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501866402</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx Xenoid
 Astrobytes: Patrick you know how to check that by now!
 Maliamnon: horray - same result after a refactor. Minor miracle
 Remus_: Doju yeah mine does that too.. had to hard cap it becuse I coulnd't fix it xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I should do pushups when I syntax error...I would be buff
 Doju: yeah, i think i know why it did depth 10000 just fine
 Doju: there are only 4 branches o.o
 Hvosten: what represent node and branch in your graphs?
 Hvosten: It's hard to imagine for me :D
 Doju: Node is one gamestate
 Doju: branch is a chain of nodes
 struct: depth 10000?
 Remus_: Yeah that's too muchI don't think in 100 turn you can have that deapth without doing nothing for a long time.
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0fd6b13-3c61-422b-b66e-6660c3d1f814">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0fd6b13-3c61-422b-b66e-6660c3d1f814</a>
 Doju: Ohh right of course
 Doju: I forgot to add resting as a possibility
 Doju: i think it's working otherwise
 Doju: seems to be working
 Doju: 15 branches at depth 2
 cegprakash: wow 9 wins in first 10 games
 cegprakash: :o
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wait 10 minutes, it'll change, lol
 Zerfa: i was thinking IDA* for spell order sims, but I'm struggling to consider a heuristic that is admissible (doesn't overestimate)has anyone tried and had luck with, or can suggest a better heuristic that doesn't overestimate "distance"
 cegprakash: I used Zenoscave's bot to improve mine
 Zenoscave: cool My bot has a bunch of bugs
 cegprakash: I couldn't win Zenoscave but I improved my score against Zenoscave
 icecream17: Zenoscave - some bug? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501883738">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501883738</a>
 Zenoscave: Yeah Timeouts i'm aware of. Lowering threshold to stop search
 cegprakash: he probably debugging that crash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well, submit finally stopped, holy crap.  simple search jumped me up to 1678th ... almost a 1000 place improvement over just barely runnable
 cegprakash: I don't know if I'm wasting time right now lol.. coz I'm spending time on doing something greedy than implementing a search from scratch
 icecream17: Woah! I tied against someone that's not me
 kovi: perfect tie?
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501885255">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501885255</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Every brewable is attainable with the basic 4 spells... so wouldn't a reverse search be simpler?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess it depends on your starting inventory
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 icecream17: simpler, but probably not betterit'll take awhile to do potions without learning stuff
 Zhmyh: Wonder how to beat emil? Here it is&#160;:)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/501881973">https://www.codingame.com/replay/501881973</a>
 icecream17: how am i losing so much after i fixed the bug it doesn't make sensssss
 Zenoscave: Zhmyh he uses rust. the actual bot is not available in test 
 icecream17: what is wrong with codingame, i just won 6 in a row after losing 5 in a row
 Zhmyh: Zenoscave&#160;?
 Zenoscave: That's called statistics icecream17&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: And also -9 XP for you Zhmyh for that song :P
 Zenoscave: Rust can tell when you're in arena vs test.
 Zenoscave: so emil probably is a much stronger bot out of test
 Astrobytes: Rust is in debug mode in the IDE so it will timeout
 Zhmyh: Oh
 Astrobytes: Still the same for C#?
 Zhmyh: Wait, why are you saying it's in IDE?
 Zenoscave: Yup
 Astrobytes: Was this a leaderboard match Zhmyh?
 Zenoscave: Was it from a submit?
 Zhmyh: No
 Zhmyh: Yes
 Astrobytes: ...
 Zhmyh: Bot which is not "IDE"
 Astrobytes: Did you play it locally "Play my code" or was it a match you found from "Last Battles"?
 Zhmyh: Locally
 Astrobytes: Then it's played in the IDE
 Astrobytes: So the Rust bot is in debug mode
 Zhmyh: Ok, didn't know that
 Astrobytes: Now you do&#160;:)
 Majeck: Weird... My code doesn't print an output but I get no timeout error
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like euler got the groove back
 Majeck: Nor StackOverflow error
 Zenoscave: spoke too soon Presac
 Zenoscave: PatrickMcGinnisII***
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i sure did
 cegprakash: I beat someone with same profile pic as eulerscheZahl and I was shocked for a second :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm starting to think perfect game is possible to find
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it may come down to the urgency bonus
 PatrickMcGinnisII: too much coffee
 PatrickMcGinnisII: g/l. dinnertime
 icecream17: At some point you have to account for the opponent though. But my code isn't ready for that yet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the random brew screws it up to
 Majeck: BenjaminUrquhart
 Majeck: I'm having the same exact problem you described
 Majeck: With "Replay in same conditions" I get different outcomes depending on where I put debug messages
 Cappefra: I think I started off with a failing solution type and I'm too lazy to change it now
 Majeck: I'm so confused
 cegprakash: all skills auto reset when I learn?
 Zenoscave: I think no. ceg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last element of opponent_cast data radomly goes missing in input data, wth
 Astrobytes: PEBCAP
 MarekM: i am starting new algo third time now, timings are very erratic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup Astrobytes, the input data is just longer than the game information window
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Michael_Howard: My first starting 10/10 since bronze :heart_eyes:
 Astrobytes: Annoying when that happens
 Doju: apparently deepcopy doesn't like the fact that im subclassing list
 Astrobytes: gj Michael_Howard
 Michael_Howard: Lost #11 but I don't care lol
 Astrobytes: every little helps right&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I want to display a number in log after cast command but the judge assumes I'm trying to repeat the cast action
 Illedan: Serious submit time :scream:
 Nerchio: #top150
 Zenoscave: Submits are super slow rn Illedan
 Illedan: Yeah, I feel it 
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 Illedan: Still 100% win
 Zenoscave: how many in a row?
 Nerchio: 5
 Illedan: 24
 Illedan: And a lose :D
 Zenoscave: My record was 26 earlier today. 
 Illedan: Sweeeet, something to work on
 Zenoscave: Gotta love bugs&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: 21 this time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: thinking aloud, if you take the most expensive brew and search backwards, the other brews should exist along the path to your current inventory
 Zenoscave: not always
 Illedan: Not at all Patrick
 Zenoscave: probably never
 Tandy1000: TOTALLY WRONG PATRICK
 Illedan: Brews are not subsets of each others
 Zenoscave: lol Tandy1000
 Astrobytes: SHOUTY MUCH TandY1000? :D
 anoburn: oh boy, how I love inconsistent runtimes ...
 Tandy1000: I LIKE TRAINS
 Zenoscave: asdf
 PatrickMcGinnisII: was trying to figure out how to reverse search and consolidate 5 end states into one search, either way I'm storing a hash of known gamestates
 Zenoscave: ding ding ding
 Astrobytes: All aboard
 Illedan: Nice, top50 and only 50% :rocket:
 Zenoscave: how many losses?
 Zenoscave: I think we'll be close
 Illedan: :wave:
 Zenoscave: Hi neighbor
 cegprakash: Zenoscave I think u learn some bad skills
 Illedan: Just passing by
 Illedan: no worries
 cegprakash: bad spells*
 Zenoscave: wdym ceg
 Zenoscave: :P
 cegprakash: wdym&#160;?
 Illedan: 8 loses in 50 games
 Zenoscave: what do you mean
 Illedan: and a lose against zeno
 Illedan: -.-
 Zenoscave: 9 now
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: 2?!
 Illedan: Comon
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501923156">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501923156</a>
 cegprakash: ur first skill Zenoscave
 cegprakash: it was bad learning
 Zenoscave: how so?
 Zenoscave: don't worry Illedan 5 losses right after you
 cegprakash: u trade a t2 for 2 t1s
 cegprakash: there are better skills that I picked
 cegprakash: compare my learning with urs
 Zenoscave: I don't rank learning
 Astrobytes: Compare your ranks ceg :P
 Zenoscave: Illedan do you stop at 6?
 cegprakash: wait for submit to end
 cegprakash: 8 loss in 25 games
 cegprakash: so current rank does not matter
 Zenoscave: I had 4 lossses in 40 games
 Astrobytes: Illedan had 8 in 50
 Zenoscave: 9 in 50&#160;:/ 
 Zenoscave: 10 in 51
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, sorry&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: hit a wall
 Astrobytes: credit where credit is due 
 cegprakash: I still have deadlocks <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501925349">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501925349</a>
 Zenoscave: Yeah Illedan is kicking ass
 Astrobytes: yup, very nice 
 Majeck: If it takes me 30ms just to read the inputs does that mean I only have 20ms available for calculations and such?
 Zenoscave: yes MadKnight
 Zenoscave: Majeck
 Illedan: Just trying something. Still nothing serious
 Zenoscave: my tab is off
 Majeck: Dammmmn
 Majeck: Thanks Zenoscave
 Illedan: *not too serious
 cegprakash: some ppl are not addable on ide to test?
 Majeck: That's so little time
 Astrobytes: It shouldn't take 30ms to read the inputs though surely
 Majeck: cegprakash they have to be in the top 1000
 Majeck: of your league
 Majeck: Astrobytes it takes me 25-40ms on average to read all inputs 
 Astrobytes: when do you start your timer?
 Majeck: At the start of the while(true)
 Doju: aarghhh
 Doju: why does deepcopy freak out when i subclass list
 Majeck: Then I call gameInputs.UpdateTurnInputs()
 Astrobytes: It should be immediately after reading your first input Majeck
 Majeck: Oh ok
 cegprakash: that's so unfair&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: why cegprakash?
 cegprakash: i want to debug
 Astrobytes: well, you can accomplish in other ways. I have faith in you&#160;:)
 cegprakash: okay able to repro now
 cegprakash: send parameters to IDE was not working first time now working
 Majeck: Oh yeah it makes much more sense now, just 0ms to read inputs :P
 Tandy1000: So uhh. What language are you guys using?
 Zenoscave: C#
 PED: Hello everyone
 Doju: aaahhh im gonna go crazy
 PED: My bot (C) sometimes often times out once submitted, but I cant reproduce it by sending params to IDE and running it again
 Waffle3z: spells and potions are fixed, does actionId always correspond to the same spell or potion between games?
 PED: Like in the IDE it doesn't seem to timeout
 Astrobytes: Hey PED, nice to see you again, what time limit are you setting?
 PED: I'm using a timer set to 40ms with clock()
 tomatoes: id different
 PED: Hey Astrobytes&#160;:)
 ClockSort: 1. work for hours.2. get worse results.3.&#160;???
 Astrobytes: Might vary because of different CPUs
 PED: I start it after reading the last input
 PED:&#160;:/
 Majeck: ClockSort 3. Delete everything and implement MCTS
 Astrobytes: Start after first input PED
 aljen: hi&#160;:)
 PED: Hmm ok will try
 cegprakash: 3 potions vs 6 potions.. 3 potions win&#160;:( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501939768">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/501939768</a>
 Michael_Howard: OMG the top is hard. I won 36/37 then won 1 out of 16. :head_bandage:
 Astrobytes: There're different servers with different specs PED, you can timeout on one and not the other sadly
 PED: Yeah but I don't nderstand why I get a timeout after 40ms
 Astrobytes: Try what I recommended and see if it still happens
 PED: I just did, still timeouts
 Astrobytes: hmmm
 PED: Damned
 PED: Thanks for the idea though
 DeWitt: do you guys simulate other player as well?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, only 36 brews ... 36 spells, all possible paths should be able to be made locally as a kinda book and easily computed for score/turn  (ignoring opp of course)
 DeWitt: my bot when times out just learns another spell, increasing a chance of a timeone for the next tick :D
 PED: Whith 20ms it works&#160;:(
 Braykin08: It's not about "36" but any combinaison of those spells. You'd need to precompute path for way too much possibilities
 Astrobytes: Pff, that's pretty grim PED
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, re-inventing the wheel, I just know once I put learn in there my search is gonna go to hell
 struct: Shame that C doesnt have high resolution timer
 icecream17: wow, mine doesn't account for learning either... hmmm
 Zenoscave: fix that icecream17
 Zenoscave: Illedan new submit?
 struct: PED if you run the C code in C++ does it run into same problem?
 Illedan: Testing something
 PED: Lets give it a go
 Astrobytes: hm good point struct
 struct: Also if it works try using chrono high resolution clock
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Braykin08 going from brew to 0 0 0 0 shouldn't be that exhaustive, alot of gamestates will already exist and more often than not alot of spells woould be unavail.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I dunno, Need to run locally
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Anyone run this thing locally yet?
 Zenoscave: not me but I'm sure some top do
 PED: Also seems to timeout in C++ struct
 PED: chrono high resomution clock is in case it didn't work&#160;?
 Zenoscave: yes PED
 Zenoscave: clock() is not very accurate
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: yes, I meant to say if the code runs in c++ to try high resolution clock
 PatrickMcGinnisII: g/l. need food.
 Astrobytes: there're ways around it in C but I think you have to implement your own solution (of course, it is C after all :D )
 cegprakash: do potions and their price related or completely random?
 Remus_: they are related
 Icebox: cegprakash read the github implementation
 Icebox: they are same all the time
 Astrobytes: See the source ceg
 Astrobytes: yes, what Icebox said
 ClockSort: yeah, I built my own simulator in C# so I could play versions of my code against themselves quickly.
 Astrobytes: The statement may be vague but to paraphrase recurse, the code does not lie
 Psyho: hm, that 3-way tie at 1st
 struct: yeah
 struct: 55.21
 Zenoscave: whoa
 Zenoscave: I think the locam will strike again
 struct: in case of tie at the end, do both players show as first on profile?
 Zenoscave: It's never happened 
 Illedan: There is more decimals than shown
 Icebox: struct the float is truncated for display
 struct: ah right
 Zenoscave: What if there was a float level tie?
 struct: Still there is a few people hiding
 Icebox: I'm assuming the player that was first before the tie will still remain first
 struct: I saw someone started on discord but never sent the message
 struct: He is quite good, but not very active
 struct: and is known for hiding&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: do tell
 PED: No timeouts so far&#160;!
 struct:&#160;;)
 PED: Thanks struct&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: heh awesome
 Astrobytes: And you are using pragmas PED?
 Remus_: My code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgflip.com/i/4mezpx">https://imgflip.com/i/4mezpx</a>
 PED: Still by bot is garbage tier but thats unrelated
 PED: #pragma GCC optimize "O3,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 PED: donnu if I should change them for C++
 MattSOrme: Im re-writing mine from python to java, and i might be over-engineering code thats never run haha. I have so many classes already and it can't even play yet
 MattSOrme: Got till silver league is released to get there
 struct: #pragma GCC optimize("O3","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 struct: Should be fine PED
 DeWitt: forgot about pragma, now ez -100 places. thanks, struct!
 struct: np
 Astrobytes: MattSOrme: no you have until the end of the competition, you can still plough through the leagues after they open
 Remus_: that pragma double the states my bot searches holy hack
 Michael_Howard: OMG it's like there's a bouncer guarding the top 100 who won't let me past for more than 30 seconds
 Andy176822: does anyone know if C++ is compiled optimised?
 Zenoscave: -O0 -g
 DeWitt: it's not
 Astrobytes: No Andy176822
 Andy176822: ahh dang, ok thanks
 Astrobytes: see previous #pragmas
 Astrobytes: scroll up
 DeWitt: guys, at 100-150, do you do anything else from bfs?
 Andy176822: oh wow, perfect timing to ask that
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 DeWitt: (i only do bfs&#160;:) )
 Psyho: DeWitt no&#160;:)
 Andy176822: thanks
 struct: A bit overkill
 struct: #pragma GCC optimize("O3","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 Zenoscave: Psyho bfs only?
 Michael_Howard: @DeWitt I'm not doing any search trees &amp; I'm above that now&#160;:)
 Waffle3z: where are all of the different spells and potions defined in the source?
 struct: Deck Waffle3z
 Astrobytes: Deck I believe
 Illedan: Deck class

 DeWitt: Psyho nice optimization
 Waffle3z: automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i don't even know how to pick the best
 icecream17: that kinda applies
 Astrobytes: alright, laters everyone. Good luck and see ya tomorrow
 Remus_: bye
 geppoz: bye
 Good_Coder: What do you put in your Generated stub?
 Zaphus: is it right that Codingame uses wall clock, not application time - for the timeouts?C++ - I've been using clock() all these years, and see people talking about the HR timer.If I compare, I can see massive differences between the two (40ms vs 75ms) even though there was no timeout.  confused
 Good_Coder: ...
 Marcelo-Hackerman: am i playing against bots
 Marcelo-Hackerman: wtf, always the same guys
 Codeab: im not a bot
 Marcelo-Hackerman: nice
 Marcelo-Hackerman: AlkhilJohn is a bot
 Marcelo-Hackerman: there is no way
 icecream17: i mean, do you or your code play?
 icecream17: and do opponents or their code play?
 Good_Coder: What do you put in your Generated stub?
 Good_Coder:&#160;??????????????????????
 struct: what do you mean Good_Coder?
 struct: the default code?
 Good_Coder: Stub generator inpuy
 Good_Coder: input*
 icecream17: uh, probably completely misunderstanding... i don't put anything in the input...
 icecream17: do you know how to code?
 icecream17: nvm, i just hovered over your profile and it says lvl 20
 Doju: Arghh i'm seriously going crazy
 Avi123: help i have no idea what im dong. all my code just chooses the last recipe and i cant change it. help
 Doju: deepcopy doesnt want to cooperate
 Doju: and copy isn't sufficient
 Doju: plz send help
 icecream17: in js, if you copy a nested array
 icecream17: i mean
 icecream17: if you copy the array [object, object2]
 icecream17: object will still change
 geppoz: Doju you dont need to deepcopy everything
 Doju: geppoz yeah but if i don't deepcopy my gamestates it just doesn't work
 geppoz: in some case the shallow copy is a blessing
 geppoz: if both has to store same recipe, let's not deepcopy
 geppoz: only when you modify it, then create a new one in the new game
 icecream17: maybe global variables or something?
 geppoz: when it is the same, lets new game point to same of the old one
 Doju: global variables are definitely not the solution haha
 Avi123: can anyone recommend a python tutorial instead of me just typing random words
 Illedan: Montecarlo based python coding? :O
 icecream17: i meant, if your code uses global variables then that could be the problem...
 Doju: Ah right. But yeah, only some constants, icecream17
 geppoz: @Illedan I'm using python just to learn it
 icecream17: Maybe some complicated "self" or .... idk, why does your code break when using just copy
 geppoz: I suppose I will go back to c++ if I continue this challenge
 Doju: icecream17 I'm trying to simulate actions
 Doju: so to store the new action i have to deepcopy the old gamestate and modify the copy
 Doju: to store the new gamestate*
 icecream17: the simplest solution i can think of is to put everything in a class, then make a new class, but that's probably not a very _good_ solution
 Doju: uh, what? lol
 Doju: nevermind, im just gonna try to figure it out
 Bubaptik: Is 50ms per turn typical for CodingGame contests? How was it in previous games?
 Illedan: Yes
 Xenoid: It's typical
 raymoo: if you use haskell you only need shallow copies since everything is immutable
 raymoo: hope this helps xoxo
 ClockSort: cool, i'll just rewrite everything in haskell real quick here
 Doju: yeah sure it's 2 am i'll do that
 FrancoisB: yeah, I was going to say, doesn't look helpful at all in the short or medium term :D
 icecream17: haskell and rust sound like such interesting languages
 Tandy1000: And here I am, just minding my own business writing in VB.NET
 FrancoisB: The language used is probably not the issue anyway
 icecream17: Doju, python classes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html</a>
 Doju: Yeah, i know what classes are lol
 icecream17: maybe make a gameState class?then make a new game, oh....
 icecream17: but why deepcopy? changing the branch will change both....
 icecream17: *the original
 Doju: yes but i want multiple branches
 Doju: that differ
 icecream17: copy multiple times? or maybe make a parent property
 icecream17: yeah, deepcopy means that if you change the copy, you change the original, since they're the same
 Doju: in python it's the other way
 icecream17: really? wow
 Doju: if you change the copy you don't change the original
 dreadylein: huh in what langauge is a deepcopy like this&#160;? 
 Doju: python
 Beresta: I'd rather ask in which language deepcopy is not like this :D 
 dreadylein: i meant a deepcopy that only copys refs&#160;:)
 dreadylein: yep
 Doju: wait, no
 Doju: nvm yeah
 Doju: xd
 Doju: I'm gonna try pickling and unpickling the gamestates now
 Beresta: alright, tried to naively implement monte carlo and my terrible implementation could finish only 50-100 random games per turn, thats way beyond terrible :D 
 FrancoisB: The good news is that there is a lot of room for improvement&#160;:)
 dreadylein:&#160;:)
 Beresta: yea true
 dreadylein: a full mc implementation&#160;?
 Beresta: I mean like randomly play a game and memorize if you win or lose for each starting turn, take best one
 Beresta: but it can't work with 50-100 games played, thats silly
 dreadylein: true sample size kinda small hehe
 Beresta: yea, well I need to opmimize my sim, its just too inefficient atm
 Scarfield: whats your depth?
 Beresta: I'm trying with full games now, so up to 100&#160;:) 
 Beresta: didn't wanted to come with heuristics to evaluate the state for now, but I'll do later
 totorroto: totorroto has not provided 1 lines in time.totorroto was disqualified.
 totorroto: this means that my code is too slow?
 Beresta: yea, over 50ms most likely
 Ifthel: Too slow or stuck in an infinite loop
 reCurse: Or crashed
 totorroto: okey.. thanks, i think infinite loop make sense
 Jdools05: yeah first line has 1000ms maximum and every round after that has 50ms maximum... i think
 totorroto: okey it crash in the first one, dont think my code is that slow
 Jdools05: yeah I just double checked my numbers it is &lt;= 50ms and &lt;=1000ms
 Marcelo-Hackerman: wow i am so dumb
 FrancoisB: not enough context to know for sure
 Scarfield: xD
 Beresta: lol :D
 Beresta: well yea in my tester if I use 50s instead of 50ms mc gives decent moves, now I just need to make it 1000x faster :D 
 Doju: Ok im done
 Doju: i give up for today
 Doju: and tomorrow i dont have time so bye bye competition
 icecream17: wow, emil.
 anoburn: Top 100 for a couple of seconds! :tada: With that, I can go to bed happily
 Tandy1000: stupid question. does castable not mean what i think it means? as in, if a spell has already been cast?
 tomatoes: cooldown
 Tandy1000: yes, does it indicate the cooldown? so if i cast a spell, it should turn to 0, right?
 FrancoisB: cast-able, 1 means you are able to cast it
 icecream17: castable is a self-explanatory name
 Topjimmies: yes
 ClockSort: what happens if you try to learn a tome spell that has too much tax, more than you can hold? illegal move, or extra discarded?
 Topjimmies: extra discarded
 ClockSort: is this before or after paying the tax?
 Xenoid: You pay the tax, then take whatever fits in your inventory
 Xenoid: I can't think of any other ways to make major improvements to my bot. I guess I will tweak parameters and hope that has some huge effect, but I am not too hopeful
 benlinn: hey guys whats up
 benlinn: just made it to wood 1
 benlinn: wait so we can't beat wood 1 right now? even with the perfect program
 dreadylein:&#160;?
 dreadylein: you can get to bronze atm&#160;:)
 benlinn: ooo ok sweet. so i have something to shoot for
 benlinn: ooh ok so silver opens up in 2 days then
 ClockSort: @Xenoid what rank did you reach with your program?
 Xenoid: Right now #12
 ClockSort: is it normal to have to only use about 25ms, because anything more can spike over 50 at random?
 reCurse: If you're using a garbage collected language, yes
 BrunoFelthes: Languages with garbage collector is garbage here at coding game @cloksort
 reCurse: Well there's a couple of C# in the top 20, but it has a pretty good GC
 ClockSort: i'm using c#, but shouldn't i be able to control that with the following?
 ClockSort: and then GC.Collect(); before the ReadLine() calls
 BrunoFelthes: Why they dont expose GC at Javascript and JAVA?
 reCurse: Ask Google and Oracle
 BrunoFelthes: I'm asking here at codingame
 BrunoFelthes: it is possible to expose the GC at node
 ClockSort: Illedan can you just collect in between moves so the time is not counted?
 BrunoFelthes: it is a parameter
 reCurse: Well because they don't give you control over the command line
 Illedan: No, because you have no CPU power when it is not your turn.
 reCurse: That's as simple as that
 reCurse: If they had a way to do it in code then it'd be fine
 BrunoFelthes: but they could add this parameter, no
 Illedan: Startup parameter?
 BrunoFelthes: yes
 reCurse: You've been around long enough to know it's been an ongoing debate and they haven't gotten around to exposing that
 reCurse: If they ever will
 Illedan: BrunoFelthesCheck this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5675bf9fab9a4d27753784fd901df125073f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5675bf9fab9a4d27753784fd901df125073f</a>I guess you can try to run your program yourself with that flag :P
 reCurse: lol
 ClockSort: my program makes a ton of garbage to collect because it makes gamestates and abandons them during the search
 reCurse: Then you might want to fix that
 ClockSort: what an interesting idea. Not creating garbage.
 BrunoFelthes: I already did a thread about it... I just think that they dont care about novice players that dont know advanced code...
 BrunoFelthes: there is a lot of things that they could do to avoid random timeouts, but they dont care about it...
 reCurse: Because exposing a command line is novice friendly?
 BrunoFelthes: they even discuss about it
 BrunoFelthes: i'm not talking about it
 BrunoFelthes: there are another solutions that could minimize the problem
 BrunoFelthes: like time buffers...
 reCurse:&#160;?
 BrunoFelthes: for example, if you do not use your 50ms, you can save up to 10ms to other turns...
 FrancoisB: Maybe use pooling or other strategies to minimize memory usage
 BrunoFelthes: or, during the entire game, you can use 10ms extras for 5 turns...
 reCurse: That opens a huge can of worms asking for a reimplementation of their system
 reCurse: This is no simple ask
 BrunoFelthes: yes, but it will add a big increment at the user experience
 reCurse: Debatable
 BrunoFelthes: yes.. debatable...
 BrunoFelthes: but, I'm here for 3 years, and they never talk about it...
 BrunoFelthes: this platform is not noob friendly
 reCurse: It's all about priorities
 BrunoFelthes: sure
 reCurse: There's a million things they can do to improve, everyone has an opinion
 reCurse: Adding D support for instance
 BrunoFelthes: noob is not a priority here, it is what I am saying
 Bobbadillio: Yeah, I'd love to see a move to something docker-based that allowed you to run almost anything with whatever parameters you wanted in a container! A man can dream&#160;:)
 reCurse: I think you're wrong
 BrunoFelthes: There is a million things, and they do nothing
 reCurse: Not true but ok you're entitled to your opinion
 BrunoFelthes: list just one thing to increase the usage of javascript
 dreadylein: i dont see how a timebank would realy help i mean .. in the end you would just obfuscate the problem with it&#160;? Or do i miss something&#160;?
 BrunoFelthes: javascript is just a garbage here...
 reCurse: Just a bandaid before complaining about the next thing
 reCurse: Javascript will never be competitive in a realtime competition
 dreadylein: true
 Illedan: They do a lot, but they focus on what gives them, as a company, the most value I guess. 
 reCurse: Not a question of noob friendliness
 reCurse: Use the right tool for the job
 Illedan: ^
 BrunoFelthes: @dreadylein, at list you will not have timeouts, javascript has a bad performance, and if you need to cap at 30ms, it is terrible
 Illedan: It's more efficient for a dev to learn a new language than to optimize JS on the platform :P
 dreadylein: but wouldnt you end up at the same point&#160;? the other people would just exhaust the timebank
 BrunoFelthes: @illedan, some people are here to learn things...
 reCurse: It's a bandaid
 reCurse: Then focus on learning instead of competing
 BrunoFelthes: even for learn, cap the algo with 30ms is very bad
 dreadylein: but its a massive overhaul for little gain
 dreadylein: i understand the intention, but whats the difference in the end&#160;?
 BrunoFelthes: User experience
 reCurse: Might not want to extend the lie that javascript is competitive in realtime
 BrunoFelthes: just it... if the noob frustate at the first competition, he do not came back to the second
 reCurse: That's doing a favor
 reCurse: So you should be able to go 1st regardless of language?
 dreadylein: but does he&#160;? i mean if someone says 1 word, he will get explained whats causing it normaly 
 Bobbadillio: You just went there I think but recurse, when you talk competitive, are you talking about top of legendary league or difference between gold and legend?
 dreadylein: and learning about the gc is pretty important 
 reCurse: If you're at the point you're frustrated at not getting more performance you're competing
 reCurse: So adapt
 Bobbadillio: I wouldn't be shocked if javascript could be made to run at high gold or legendary in most competitions
 reCurse: If the game requires computation like this one, I would heavily doubt
 Bobbadillio: Top javascript right now is Karang at 104, I think that's out of 3k in bronze, how many are likely to be in legend? is it usually a percent thing?
 dreadylein: balancing the speed of different languages is basicly impossible, at least i dont see a way
 reCurse: It varies
 reCurse: They usually aim to have 100 in legend at end of competition but it's a huge guess
 FrancoisB: And the people that maybe *could* get a top javascript bot probably go for another language anayway
 BrunoFelthes: i just disagree about: "If you dont know how to increase the performance, you code will broke randomly, and if you dont know very advanced tricks, just get out of here"... Some people just want to have fun, with less knowledge
 reCurse: Then please have fun
 reCurse: If you worry about performance it's another story
 BrunoFelthes: how to have fun if your code broke randomly with 30ms timeout
 BrunoFelthes: it is not fun
 reCurse: This conversation is going nowhere
 FrancoisB: Are you doing some tree search Bruno?
 FrancoisB: fixed length or dynamic?
 reCurse: Please keep getting frustrated at eating soup with a fork
 Westicles: Now let's move on and talk about how great genetic algorithms are
 Illedan: :scream:
 ClockSort: can I use c# using statements to trigger cleanup at the end of the scope?
 reCurse: Yes
 BrunoFelthes: @franoisB yes, but i'm changing the language again, because I'm a javascript dev now, I'm using codingame to learn more about javascript, but this site is not good for it
 Marcelo-Hackerman: eai cade os br
 BrunoFelthes: ta no canal pt :P
 Marcelo-Hackerman: i, sabia n kkkkk
 FrancoisB: These competition can be a bit rough for beginners but as far as I understand that's not really the target. They recommend practicing on the other problems
 Bennjo: Hello, World!
 FrancoisB: :wave:
 dreadylein: Hello, Bennjo 
 BrunoFelthes: @FrancoisB, in other words: if you dont know about advanced tricks, get out of this competition
 FrancoisB: Not really what I said but be prepared to hit issues for the first time and spend time working around them.
 Illedan: I find it better to try on this contest anyhow. More people talking about it, a lot of help to get, etc..
 dreadylein: true
 ClockSort: i make 30 moves and a certain portion of my code takes 3ms on average. Then on the 31st move it takes more that 14ms and makes me forfeit. is this really the GC collecting for the first time?!
 reCurse: Maybe, maybe not
 BrunoFelthes: it is really hard to avoid GC at javascript...
 reCurse: Obviously this site fault
 FrancoisB: I tend to have counters in my algorithm that count the number of loops/steps/... and often the the cause of these spikes is the algorithm
 ClockSort: there is nothing in the values that should cause longer runtime
 FrancoisB: That can help with troubleshootting
 BrunoFelthes: no, the site could make it less painfull
 reCurse: CG fix javascript plz
 reCurse: Send PR to google
 Westicles: Why is it not okay to post your code, but it is okay to stream it?
 reCurse: The rationale is it's a lot harder to copy/paste
 reCurse: But it is a fine line
 Illedan: And it is recommended not to stream too strong bots
 FrancoisB: I guess the stream is here to bring some engagement
 reCurse: Pretty much
 FrancoisB: and probably unlikely to make it into the top 
 GetSchwifty:  do any streamers use sims?
 Illedan: I wouldn't be able to code optimally on stream. Need that peace in mind to debug :P
 BrunoFelthes: yes, they use
 FrancoisB: I would probably be more conservative in my goals if I was live streaming haha
 GetSchwifty: I've never dived into simulations, mostly because I got no clue how to start
 dreadylein: the you are lucky, thats a good challenge for starting with it&#160;:)
 reCurse: Streaming is a massive mental debuff, no idea how pros do it 14hr/day
 dreadylein: *then
 GetSchwifty: yea, maybe I should bite the bullet, but don't have much free time
 GetSchwifty: might give it a go&#160;:)
 dreadylein: try it, the game rules are pretty straight forward&#160;:)
 Topjimmies: I'm hardstuck 500
 dreadylein: hello hardstuck 500
 ClockSort: ok it's definitely the GC. When I don't make a queue of 4000 game states, it doesn't happen (all else the same).
 ClockSort: that's really annoying
 ClockSort: can I just malloc and free this one thing? pretty please?&#160;:)
 FrancoisB: What language are you using?

 ClockSort: C#
 FrancoisB: What about pre-allocating 4000 game states and not needing to garbage collect anything?
 ClockSort: :light_bulb:
 Zenoscave: That's a common approach
 Zenoscave: It works well
 ClockSort: good idea, I'll try it
 Zenoscave: Just make sure you keep parent refs and enough nodes to not run out
 EladYaniv01: Anybody in wood league getting wrong inventory values&#160;?
 Bobbadillio: I had some really weird stuff happen when I didn't parse all my inputs right, but I can't say I saw anything like what you're saying, sorry
 Kuraishi: Before I start refactoring my code, does anyone know if you can rename the Player class to something else, or does 'main' need to be defined in the Player class?
 DaNinja: needs to be Player iirc
 Zenoscave: It must be Player in java
 Zenoscave: C# it doesn't matter
 Kuraishi: Gotcha, thank you.
 Zenoscave: yw 
 Bobbadillio: Alright, I've got a hacky bot that tries to maximize received points per turn with the 'standard' spells, but I'm thinking I'll want to build a bit more intelligently

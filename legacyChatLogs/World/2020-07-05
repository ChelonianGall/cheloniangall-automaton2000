 LelouchVC2: Yea, don't do it
 eulerscheZahl: just thinking out loudly on hackerrank:i would sequentially scan the queue and see if someone is at a "better" position in the line
 eulerscheZahl: that can only be done by bribing
 eulerscheZahl: then adjust the initial order to reflect this, increment the bribe counter
 eulerscheZahl: repeat until end of queue
 LelouchVC2: This site makes me sad by the day
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank?
 LelouchVC2: I ran my code, it didnt pass a test
 LelouchVC2: I ran it again, it passed the test
 eulerscheZahl: i liked the world code sprints on hackerrank, sadly they stopped holding public contests&#160;:(
 LelouchVC2: People come on cplusplus.com often with problems from some competitions, easy to get tired of them
 caubeloatchoat24: I do, but in case 2 ones [6] , [4] is a a "lower" position in the line, and [4] stands behind [6] that means [6] bribes [4]. But in case a lot of people "lower" bribes, i dont know how to solve. P/s: much solve by O(N)&#160;:((
 caubeloatchoat24: *must sr :D
 caubeloatchoat24: u can switch to codeforces or topcoder by clashing with "true pro coder"&#160;:&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: do you imply that CG users are no good coders here?
 LelouchVC2: I'm not saying black people are black
 LelouchVC2: But I'm saying that white people aint black
 DinuBrat: Русские?
 eulerscheZahl: #Ru
 jacek: tomatoes is on fire i see

 struct: Still using MCTS tomatoes?
 tomatoes: im not sure if it still mcts
 struct: :D
 jacek: jacekmax?
 struct: Are you still working on othello jacek?
 jacek: i put it on hold
 jacek: until someone surpases me, then ill rage and upload stronger bot
 struct: you have opening book?
 jacek: no
 Raysh: sorry guys stupid question probably I am new to coding
 Raysh: but why does this show
 Raysh: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... Raysh will no longer be active in this game.
 Raysh: when I put an if condition
 struct: You might not be outputing anything
 struct: or have an infinite loop
 Raysh: oh
 Piptrosia: this can't be right
 VinhDaDen: Galindo Jonathan Hahahaha

 nhiha60591: ...
 ameybhavsar24: How to know if a account if bot on Clash?
 jai_m: Hey anyone there?
 jacek: it should say so in their profile
 PkZ: Is there a keybind to see information / see other functions? for example seeing Substring information / different variations?
 tomatoes: try ctrl-space
 PkZ: yeah ctrl-space gives information and ctrl-shift-space gives the overloads
 PkZ: didnt know what overloads were properly called
 WINWINWIN: python_programerPP please dont reject puzzles for no good reason...
 Champi67: Hello there&#160;! I have a little problem with my code&#160;: I have a two dimensionnal array, which I read in a for (). When it try to read array[i][0], I have a "cannot read property 0 of undefined", but a console.error(array[i][0]) show me the correct value... Anybody has an idea? Thanks in advance&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Sometimes this happens if the value does not exist within the function Champi67
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/typeerror-cannot-read-property-0-of-undefined/257636">https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/typeerror-cannot-read-property-0-of-undefined/257636</a>
 WINWINWIN: Someone else had the exact same error as you and this was the advice given to him.
 Champi67: Hm, so I should try to add a function that takes the array as a parameter?
 WINWINWIN: I think that should work.
 Champi67: Well, it doesn't&#160;:(
 jacek: huh
 struct: very strange
 Champi67: console.error(j)&#160;: 0console.error(array[0][0])&#160;: 1console.error(array[j][0])&#160;: undefined
 jacek: whats the code
 Champi67: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d539884-ce70-44d5-9254-c13fe68ecb8d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d539884-ce70-44d5-9254-c13fe68ecb8d</a>
 Champi67: but array[0][j] works fine...
 jacek: error links[0][j] but  links[j][0] in if?
 Champi67: Yes it was a try
 Champi67: I may have found a solution, but it's really... Special
 Champi67: Oh, okay so it seems that it was just in the condition, which is ||, that should be &amp;&amp;
 Nerchio: if you can't do a rollout until the end of the game in MCTS do you just limit it by max depth?
 jacek: rollouts as in random playout?
 trunghautt: python
 Nerchio: i think so jacek, learning MCTS :D
 hayder: hello
 Nerchio: i mean i dont see a point of playing random moves for lets say 40 turns in advance its just waste of computation
 BeardedWhale: If you cannot do a full rollout, you need to have some evaluation function that guesses a winner instead.
 Nerchio: assuming it's like 1 branch out of 500000 :D
 struct: Nerchio in some game its hard to eval the state
 jacek: playout is done until end of game to see the outcome. in EPT (early playout termination) you do playout to some max depth but you need eval
 struct: example uttt
 Nerchio: yeah i avoid in uttt i dont want to code in c++ :D
 Nerchio: i want to learn on bandas probably already wrote min max for it but want to try mcts
 BeardedWhale: If you have a good evaluation function, it will work better than random playout.
 Nerchio: and i can count pawns on the board so evaluating is possible
 jacek: then it might work
 Nerchio: in games without possible evaluation with gigantic trees yeah its big trouble i guess :p
 Zone_Infinity: Hello
 Zone_Infinity: anyone there?
 Zone_Infinity: Hmm.......
 Zone_Infinity: pl help

 <b>**Zone_Infinity Helllo</b></p><p><img src="/a/44652281107032" /> WINWINWIN: Yes?
 tomatoes: but its nice to see how dumb random solves the task
 Washier: trictrac, been watching you submit on Othello.  Beat you once in about 100 games so far - fluke. Go go go!
 trictrac: Hard to beat jacek now and tomatoes and Lerenard have improved too
 trictrac: and dbdr is out of game
 Washier: yes, top 5 bots are way ahead.  i've been cleared off the board by all of them (0 score for me)
 tomatoes: i tried to fight locally vs edax-reversi, and even with &lt;10ms limit it totally annihilate me
 trictrac: but with no memory limit
 darkhorse64: It has a 7 Mo data file to help for eval
 struct: not a fair fight tomatoes
 heavygabriel: yes! I figured out what went wrong with my stuff in temperatures
 heavygabriel: I made a list sort by ascending when I wanted it to be sorted by descending
 heavygabriel: and I didn't store the result
 eulerscheZahl: astrobytes: you beat me on it (discord)
 heavygabriel: what?
 Astrobytes: haha :D
 heavygabriel: now I'm trying medium stuff and holy shit
 heavygabriel: it's like a HS math exam
 heavygabriel: it's like "evan shat on the floor, determine the time it took for gravity to do its job"
 struct: Solve this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>
 struct: ezpz
 Astrobytes: Have your raycasting NN at the ready
 heavygabriel: bruh I'm struggling on easy
 heavygabriel: why would I attempt to clear expert
 Astrobytes: "evan shat on the floor..." lol, too true. I remember exams like that
 heavygabriel: my dad once had a math exam where the ending line was "can you help X with X?" he responded no, because he geniunly thought that it was an option.
 heavygabriel: genuinly*
 Astrobytes: I couldn't find that one eulerscheZahl
 Hjax: it took many tric submits, but i got a draw against him 
 Hjax: feels good man 
 eulerscheZahl: searching for 1100 did the trick for me. i had something like that in my mind but the wording was slightly different to his
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so you are the reason why my herokuapp loaded instantly when i tried?
 Astrobytes: lol, no
 Astrobytes: Just lucky for you I guess!
 eulerscheZahl: hmmit shuts down after 30min of inactivity. that means someone else was using it
 Astrobytes: Well, lots of people have the link now
 Schwase: 5.999999999999999how do i stop getting this when doing a&#160;% operation?
 struct: I use it sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: use integers
 struct:&#160;% is returning 5.9999999?
 struct: What language is this?
 Schwase: but thats the whole point is to see if it is an integer x-x%1==x
 eulerscheZahl: what type is x?
 Schwase: @struct x-x%1 returns 5.999999
 Schwase: actually, 1/(1/n-1/i) returns 5.99999999
 Schwase: so its not even&#160;% thats the issue
 eulerscheZahl: x%1?what's that good for?
 Schwase: x%1 where x is a double
 Schwase: returns the decimal
 Schwase: like 5.743%1 = 0.743
 struct: You are doing it wrong
 Schwase: how so?
 eulerscheZahl: use floor()
 struct: if you are using javascript
 Schwase: java
 struct: use toFixed(size)
 heavygabriel: now me big boy
 eulerscheZahl: the modulo will give you inaccuracies due to double precision. never compare double with ==, add some error margin instead
 heavygabriel: trying to do the ANEO sponsored puzzle
 heavygabriel: also I have to do a decimal in the most american way possible
 eulerscheZahl: or use integers then. you don't need floating points for ANEO
 heavygabriel: no
 heavygabriel: like the 3.6
 heavygabriel: instead of 3,6
 heavygabriel: like we do here
 eulerscheZahl: you can multiply by 36 and the other side by 10&#160;;)
 heavygabriel: no
 eulerscheZahl: i also got used to the . instead of , (which would be the default in Germany too)
 heavygabriel: I am currently dividing my km/h to meters/sec so I can confirm if I'll be able to pass it or not
 heavygabriel: if it's lower then IK I'll have to lower my speed
 Schwase: traffic lights&gt;
 Schwase:&#160;?
 heavygabriel: yeah
 Schwase: 71% damn
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: ┬──┬◡ﾉ(° -°ﾉ)
 heavygabriel: if I multiply my m/s speed with the duration of the light and divide my m/s with the distance I think it'll help
 heavygabriel: I'm probably way overthinking it 
 struct: At least I think im learning some stuff with these modules things
 struct: But javascript drives me crazy
 heavygabriel: welcome to JS
 heavygabriel: where NaN is a big fuck you 
 heavygabriel: I have a few questions about the ANEO thingy
 heavygabriel: nvm
 eulerscheZahl: but i have no answers. i dislike that puzzle
 heavygabriel: you can't stop
 heavygabriel: wait you can't stop?
 heavygabriel: that's retarded
 struct: Well its the point of the puzzle
 struct: to not stop
 heavygabriel: yeah but then it's a math problem
 Astrobytes: ...
 inoryy: ,,,
 jacek: math, not even once
 inoryy: maths*
 Astrobytes: Hey inoryy, are you not out spreading COVID, I mean celebrating end of lockdown in the pub? :P
 Astrobytes: And yes, maths.
 inoryy: hey Astrobytes, you know I was planning to but then had to cancel last minute
 Astrobytes: What a shame eh
 heavygabriel: wait can someone tell me if this formula is good for checking if I have to slow down? duration * (speed/3.6)/distance&gt;=0
 heavygabriel: duration is in seconds, speed is in KM/H and distance is in meters
 Schwase: you cant slow down...
 Schwase: you have to find a constant speed...
 heavygabriel: to find a constant speed*
 heavygabriel: but what I'm doing is incrementally decrease the speed to get the fastest I can go with every kind
 Schwase: you need to determine if the intersection of the car's position and the traffic light's position occur on an even interval of the light (ie t &lt; dur OR 2 * dur &lt; t &lt; 3 * dur OR etc)
 Schwase: speed * time = distance
 Schwase:&#160;:)
 heavygabriel: well that's what I did no?
 heavygabriel: speed * time= distance
 Schwase: speed / distance = 1 / t
 Schwase: try distance / speed
 Schwase: and then determine if time / duration has an even integer part
 heavygabriel: 1/t?
 Schwase: t = time
 Schwase: sorry
 heavygabriel: it's ok
 heavygabriel: I learned algebra like 3 years ago
 jacek: good for you
 LukaszMalkowicz: Hey C# why this is happening to me in defiblirator puzzle CS0103: The name `MathF' does not exist in the current context&#160;? I was using MathF before with no problem
 eulerscheZahl: i'm using C# for almost 10 years and that the first time I hear about MathF
 eulerscheZahl: seems to be a Unity library function
 Schwase: dead men's shot (pirates of the caribbean darts puzzle) was pretty fun to do
 AhmedMasry: I can't solve thor 
 Schwase: why not ahmed? (not trying to be condescending just asking what obstacle is stopping you)

 DarkDev: does anyone here play roblox
 Schwase: used to
 DarkDev: is anyone interested in making games with me
 Schwase:&#160;:\ not rly
 DarkDev: ohv okay
 DarkDev: oh*
 Schwase: someone else might tho
 DarkDev: ok
 DarkDev: i will wait
 Schwase: maybe ask on the discord server
 Schmaenajel: Dude I have opened this chat for the first time, and the first thing I read is "I buy feet pics" - I love the internet
 Schmaenajel: fml
 Astrobytes: It's not a game making site
 Schwase: "does someone want to code roblox games with me" = Unacceptable
 Astrobytes: It's not always like that Schmaenajel
 Schwase: "buying feet pics" = perfectly ok
 DarkDev: deos anyone know lua
 DarkDev: HEY
 Schwase: sureeeeeee
 DarkDev: rude
 Schwase: dude asked if someone wanted to code some games on roblox theres nothing wrong with that
 DarkDev: :angry:
 Astrobytes: Who said there was?
 Schwase: Astrobytes 05:37PMIt's not a game making site
 Schwase: hmmm
 Schwase: i wonder who had a problem with it.....
 Astrobytes: Implying he might be better off asking elsewhere, such as discord, as you suggested
 Schwase: fair enough
 DarkDev: how old ryall
 Astrobytes: Lots of people mistake CG for a game coding website cause of the name I guess
 DarkDev: who wants to make roblox games with me
 Schwase: idk astro, last night some dude came in here who was doing the whole "reverse racism is a thing and conservatives are oppressed" and that went on for a while. i feel like some people just troll when they see the window of opportunity
 DarkDev: what are yall talking about

 Schwase: so was the plane joke not actually an r/woosh?
 DarkDev: huh
 Astrobytes: Do you seriously not have anything better to do with your time?
 LelouchVC2: idk what r/woosh is
 Schwase: i said 9/11 jokes were just PLANE wrong
 LelouchVC2: i only know that sub reddits begin with r/
 DarkDev: i have nothing better to do
 DarkDev: eeeeeeeeee
 LelouchVC2: lmao, i didnt notice
 DarkDev: wow
 DarkDev: really
 LelouchVC2: I'm not home, hot as hell where i am
 Schwase: r/woosh is a reddit for people who didn't get a joke/anti joke
 DarkDev: it hot as satans layer in my room
 LelouchVC2: Hard to think when ur brain is melting
 Schwase: like if someone took me seriously saying "if africans ate more maybe they wouldnt have a hunger issue"
 Schwase: thatd be on r/woosh
 LelouchVC2: i see ;o
 Schwase: or when you corrected me and said "*plain" after i made that joke last night
 LelouchVC2: I was doing a clash while sweating so it went over my head xD

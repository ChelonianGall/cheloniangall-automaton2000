 Kirbiby: Merci pb4&#160;;)
 Agade: Ah, the erf calculation was something else. I remember assuming a gaussian...integrating ... I wonder if I kept notes somewhere
 Agade: I guess it must have been...assume the observed winrate is gaussian distributed centered on the observed winrate, and with the variance given by that "wald interval" (the p*(1-p) thing), then you want to calculate the probability that the winrate is &gt;50% by integration which gives you some function of erf
 Agade: Can probably do a better job if you find a package that lets you get the CDF of a binomial distrib
 Maxim251: Helo, Can I add in equation two pairs, and get answare as 3rd pair?
 Kirbiby: I'm also trying to understand if it's the same thing done here to measure significance in optimizations&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/koTf7u0v41o?t=2109">https://youtu.be/koTf7u0v41o?t=2109</a>

 Nerchio: So i guess me doing wonGames/Total games is not suboptimal for finding out if AI is better? :joy:
 Nerchio: is suboptimal*

 1Deep-Matrix: elo
 1Deep-Matrix: bonjour
 Rockstar555: hii
 Agade: Kirbiby I don't remember this stuff too well but it looks related. The t test becomes the "z test" above ~80 games. And the z test looks to me like counting "how many sigmas" of condifence you have and comparing that to one of these z test tables which tells you something like "2 sigma is 98% confidence" . My erf function call I believe is what you use to make these tables in the first place
 Agade: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test</a>
 Agade: We would be in the case H0: mu&gt;=50...
 Agade: And then they do a division to see how many sigmas away we landed
 Agade: I've a feeling it's quite related
 Kirbiby: hehe, thanks for taking the time to answer, I've some reading to do now&#160;:)

 Rockstar555: this very Hard 
 Rockstar555: solve this
 Kirbiby: I feel a bit dump now, basically all this math simply means: If I observe a winrate of 55% on 10 games I can't decide anything because it could be pure luck, but I observe a winrate of 55% on 100000 games, the probability of it being pure luck is quite low, so AI0 has very good chances of being better than AI1
 Kirbiby: dumb*
 Uljahn: i guess 55% means just slightly better and only vs AI1, and 100k games mean that 55% is very close to "true" winrate (on infinite number of games)
 dbdr: kovi #25 in FC, you fell no?
 AntiSquid: fc?
 Uljahn: fall contest?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: and rec*rse #9
 wlesavo: fell contest :slight_smile:

 Astrobytes: good afternoon all
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: 143 in legend
 dbdr: people put those PMs to good use
 Astrobytes: wow, indeed
 dbdr: or my boss is just weak
 Astrobytes: It seemed to be doing just fine previously&#160;;)
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Are you playing RAIC this year dbdr?
 dbdr: nope
 dbdr: I might have a quick look at one point
 dbdr: euler said a simple strategy is not too much investment
 Astrobytes: It's pretty decent tbh
 dbdr: of course it's a trap&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: as in a good game?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 dbdr: what's the basic strat?
 tsiryJL: HI all
 Astrobytes: I've not submitted yet, but mine and rush seemed to be useful before
 dbf: dbdr they have quick start example only in Rust and you still are not in?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: dbdr: #Raic2020
 dbdr: only in rust?&#160;:+1: :D
 dbdr: that's a change
 dbdr: someone must be big into rust, I remember they had a web viewer implemented in rust, quite impressive
 dbf: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/p/quick#simple-strategy">https://russianaicup.ru/p/quick#simple-strategy</a>
 Astrobytes: dbf: they added C++, C#, Python and Java in v0.4.0
 Astrobytes: An hour ago
 dbf: yep, their the only one developer is a fan of rust
 dbdr: but who still uses those, Astrobytes?&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol, away and Rust in Peace :P
 dbdr: amen
 Astrobytes: tbf, the Rust starter is very easy to read
 dbf: game is not bad, but I don't know what algo to use, have only IFs now&#160;:)
 dbdr: bUt rUSt HaS wEIrD sYNtAx!|!
 Astrobytes: lol, I think most competent non-Rustaceans would have no trouble with it. I think the biggest hurdle for people is the different way of thinking
 ZarthaxX: Crustaceans
 Astrobytes: *thinking/working
 Astrobytes: Zarthaxceans

 Astrobytes: Hey, it seems like a great way to work dbdr, I won't knock it at all
 Astrobytes: makes a lot of sense
 dbdr: yeah, it is. but no one language will be ideal for everyone and every task
 dbdr: GC/manual memory/ownership is like static/dynamic typing
 dbdr: a mix of tradeoffs and personal preferences
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes good move with the Zarthaxceans hehe
 ZarthaxX: Astroceans mate
 dbdr: well, I think manual memory management might fade off over time
 Astrobytes: lol ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: that's quite a statement dbdr!&#160;:)
 dbdr: mark my words&#160;:)
 dbdr: I see it like asm vs C: once you have good optimizing compilers, why would you bother with working without a safety net for very little benefit?
 dbdr: (and for the rare cases, you can do manual memory manageement in rust using unsafe blocks)
 Astrobytes: Oh I get you totally, it's a very optimistic outlook! Mind you, "over time" - you didn't specify how much time so&#160;;)
 dbdr: was going to say: decades&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think that's realistic

 ZarthaxX: talking about school
 ZarthaxX: i put a survey for the kids of my class, to get feedback
 ZarthaxX: so far 1 out of 7 said they would not do an advanced version of my course next year
 ZarthaxX: and that same kid said that what he would improve for next year would be that EVERYONE puts their camara on
 ZarthaxX: :face_palm:
 Astrobytes: wtf
 ZarthaxX: 12 years old objecting me that, funny
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: nothing relevant to my subject&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: my internet just dies if everyone has their camara on anyway

 LastRick: Man, when I was in school, there was basically nothing
 Astrobytes: we had a BBC microcomputer with Logo
 ZarthaxX: things were just starting 
 LastRick: This will show my age but during Comp Sci AP many yrs ago, a classmate and I wanted to code (in Turbo Pascal) a 2-player maze game for our final project. There's no internet, no books like this in the school library. My teacher was able to find a book somewhere and brought us photocopied pages to show us how to send data packets back and forth. 
 Scarfield: AnthraxX and AstroNicks
 Astrobytes: Latefield
 Scarfield: never too lateField
 Astrobytes: Nice LastRick. My highschool only had Computer Studies, nothing about any CS concepts, just some hardware and using software, there was a little BASIC programming in the last year iirc
 Astrobytes: I remember explaining the concept of the World Wide Web to my teacher in 3rd year
 Astrobytes: he'd never heard of it
 LastRick: Wow
 Scarfield: "It will never have any succes, we have phone books already"
 LastRick: As hard as it is to imagine today (as I type 1s and 0s across the world), yeah, we thought that
 Astrobytes: and that was mid-90s
 LastRick: but you have to remember, that early web was trash
 Astrobytes: Very much so
 ZarthaxX: scarfo :rofl: nice names
 ZarthaxX: i think astro used the anthraxx one already, but i will give u 1 point anyway
 Astrobytes: a while ago, but not today, so it counts
 Scarfield: yay :muscle:
 Scarfield: its weird to think about the internet before google, saw something recently about one of the first companies to provide internet to people. When he started there was 200 DK domains i think xD
 Scarfield: to people in DK that is
 LastRick: Crazy. two hundred places to get information. Now there's too much&#160;:)
 Scarfield: Age og Misinformation
 Astrobytes: Hm. People look at one resource, assume it's correct and move on...
 Astrobytes: *many people, not all obviously
 Scarfield: I can be gullible sometimes, have seen an "The Onion" head line, not noticing its the onion, and be like whaat
 LastRick: Its not all bad though. I get to code a little pod going around in circles for hours on end.
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 LastRick: OMG speaking of which, I just made Gold in CSB. Freaking awesome.
 Astrobytes: gj man!
 Astrobytes: watch out though, the inputs are different now

 JBM: oh
 JBM: didn't think you needed it
 Scarfield: i would be lost without it
 reCurse: Did I miss an amazing tool or there really is no smart way to profile python?
 LastRick: Ohhhhhh(m), sorry, took me a while to get that joke
 YodaMaster123: What exactly is Siemens?

 reCurse: Yeah well tell that to all those ML scientists
 reCurse: All their frameworks are in python not my choice
 YodaMaster123: Oh&#160;:) Like Tensorflow, Keras etc?
 reCurse: But without at least callstacks or callgraphs it's hard
 reCurse: Pytorch
 Uljahn: tried VTune but couldn't get detailed traces for numpy calls
 eulerscheZahl: profiling python sounds like a paradox
 reCurse: My GPU barely goes above 5% usage and it's annoying to sit on a single saturated python core
 reCurse: But no idea where to look
 eulerscheZahl: when you profile, you care about performance. and then you don't use python
 reCurse: Yeah well again, not my choice to use python here
 eulerscheZahl: that said i think i saw icebox doing some analysis with intelliJ
 eulerscheZahl: or whatever the name of that IDE for python is

 LastRick: What contest?
 VizGhar: tron
 ZarthaxX: gz :D
 VizGhar: Can somebody explain me, why the promotion isn't instant?
 ZarthaxX: who klnow
 ZarthaxX: s
 LastRick: Had the same thing this morning. I made Gold for CSB but waited two hours for promotion. The note read like promotions only happen at set times each day.
 VizGhar: Yeah... but for me it looks like just setting flag somewhere in database and rerun configuration against legend players
 struct: old multiplayers promotions are not instant
 LastRick: It makes me think that promotion is more than just switching a enumerator from "Gold" to "Legend". Maybe it moves you to a different server. Maybe that's why you can't go back down (aka demotion), it only works one way. Just a guess.
 VizGhar: hmm makes sense... I'd love to read abou infrastructure behind CG.
 LastRick: Wouldnt we all love to see behind the curtain? Instead we have to make do with Grandpa Euler telling us stories. about the olden days
 VizGhar: :D :D :D Grandpa Euler
 therealbeef: I'd be scared to look behind the curtain
 therealbeef: each time i submit the first two battles are played with the previous bot :thinking:
 VizGhar: huh? i dont understand... which is previous bot?
 therealbeef: me previous submit
 therealbeef: i print a version nr on startup after i started suspecting this
 LastRick: you are saying you test your code against your previous submissions?
 therealbeef: if i submit v0.18 now, the first two battle print v0.17
 therealbeef: not really a problem, but it goes to show...
 struct: therealbeef that is normal, the other bot could be in middle of a battle
 VizGhar: maybe some binaries remains cached? But it's still strange, that the others are properly labelled
 VizGhar: aha ^^ makes even more sense
 therealbeef: even if i let v0.17 run all 220 battles till convergence, the first two after submission of v0.18 will print v0.17&#160;:)
 therealbeef: granted, my bot takes 10 secs to compile
 therealbeef: so i think there's a race condition
 therealbeef: state models are hard
 DenisAkopyan: hey! Is there a standalone ide somewhere here?
 DenisAkopyan: I want to test out whether reading input using my haskell code works
 struct: Denis the only way is to copy the input
 VizGhar: Are there additional rules on UTTT after bronze?
 therealbeef: nope
 VizGhar: tnx
 therealbeef: just more optimizations ahead :D
 VizGhar: I've solved 3x3 tictactoe in my free time some time back using minimax... but this looks really like MCTS problem... so C/C++ is only way right?&#160;:|
 VizGhar: hmm 31st place is Java :O
 therealbeef: there's javas in legend and pythons
 therealbeef: and im doing (stubbornly) minimax
 therealbeef: but yeah, it seems you are right&#160;:)
 VizGhar: heh... alright&#160;:) I have no energy for CG for next week or so :P wll see you all soon
 Uljahn: therealbeef: reach legend in c++ then submit python bot or send compiled binary inside python, that's the only two ways to see python in UTTT legend i guess :pensive:
 struct: Uljahn whats the highest you reached there with python?
 therealbeef: Uljahn ah right, there's indeed no pythons in uttt legend
 therealbeef: payback for the clash of codes i had to suffer in shortest program mode with C++&#160;;-)
 Uljahn: struct: mid gold with just ucb1, i struggle with mcts' tree structure
 therealbeef: what's ucb?
 Uljahn: upper confidence bound
 therealbeef: thanks
 therealbeef: gotta try this mcts some time
 Uljahn: ye, uttt fits well as mcts playground
 therealbeef: that ship has sailed for me
 Uljahn: why
 therealbeef: started with minimax, dont feel like changing now
 therealbeef: also i like the challenge
 Uljahn: do you use bitboards?
 therealbeef: nope, just std::arrays of enums
 therealbeef: and some template meta programming
 therealbeef: it's lightning fast, just not winning hehe
 therealbeef: inferior algo lol
 Uljahn: using a-b pruning?
 therealbeef: yep
 therealbeef: with interative deepening
 therealbeef: and sorting at higher levels
 therealbeef: still thinking of trying principal variation search
 therealbeef: or just throwing out worst half at every level
 therealbeef: hitting look ahead depth of 8/9/10 now, and 12-15 or full in end game
 KnightMoves: how are you using minimax? do you have an evaluation function? or are you only scoring end states?
 therealbeef: i have heuristic function yeah
 therealbeef: doing 3.7M evals per sec
 therealbeef: but I think I'm not using those evals effectively (obviously)
 KnightMoves: Yeah i think writing a heuristic function for UTTT is not easy, hence all the MCTS bots
 therealbeef: the advantage of tuning-less or self-tuning algorithms
 struct: Its too hard to eval uttt positions
 Miraaaaacle: Knowing psychology, this kind of studying is the best.
 therealbeef: learning by being challenged
 struct: site a little bit slow?
 LastRick: seems that way
 struct: Is it always at the same time?
 LastRick: hmmmm, good q
 Miraaaaacle: Too slow
 Rock-Lee: holy shit too slow
 struct: even if my code uses no time it takes so long to start&#160;:(
 BlueChild_7dc0: yeah what happened here everything was running fine and all of a sudden code is taking forever to run
 BlueChild_7dc0: or just the site itself has slowed 
 struct: Seems like it is the site
 Sergen: I believe that happens when leaderboards get updated around 12 am GMT
 Miraaaaacle: This isn't free right?
 struct: it is
 HorseNuggets: yeah that happens on the site every once in a while
 HorseNuggets: usually it's fine tho

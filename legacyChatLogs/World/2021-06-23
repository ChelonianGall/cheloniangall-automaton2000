 TheBigBadMaster_164: yes, you can see previous submissions
 DaNinja: in CoC?
 DaNinja: I thought its not possible in CoC
 ableflyer: it is possible
 ableflyer: but some people won't show their code
 ableflyer: even when they're like the first ones to solve it
 Husoski: @TeachMeSenpai You can if you saved or can find the URL.  If' it's recent, you can scroll through result notifications to get to the result screens for clashes you were in.  You get to see your code, plus the code of anyone who shared.
 DavidDeLord: how do you remove the discord banner at the top of this chat
 TeachMeSenpai: @Husoki Thank you, kinda lame they don't save it for you. 
 Husoski: I think the idea is to make cheating with databases of solved clashes harder to do.  (But the CG bots do exactly that!)
 TeachMeSenpai: ohh that makes perfect sense

 SubwayMan: I have a test tomorrow but I just spent 2 hours on making an among us codingame puzzle. What's wrong with me
 Sean_70: I don't capish
 Sean_70: It is very difficult for I
 Sean_70: shish

 ViktorZafirovski: Can someone help me out with the codingame-sponsored-contest?
 ViktorZafirovski: It says there should be 3 inputs every turn, but I'm seeing 5.
 Westicles: Read it again
 ViktorZafirovski: I did, and on the twelfth reading I figured out that I am blind 
 ViktorZafirovski: Or something.
 ViktorZafirovski: Much obliged.
 ViktorZafirovski: :D
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt;
 ViktorZafirovski: You know how it goes. If you don't ask, you'll never see it. But you don't need to ask.
 ViktorZafirovski:&#160;:|
 Westicles: Input for one game turn:  line 1, line 2, line 3, line 4...
 ViktorZafirovski: Yeah, I got it. Now if only I can figure out a way to actually test the code. This challenge is perplexing.
 ViktorZafirovski: Not the challenge itself, moreso the format.
 KiwiTae: the goal is to find what to do
 KiwiTae: its pretty simple once you got it
 ViktorZafirovski: No, I get that, but I don't see how I'm supposed to even start.
 KiwiTae: print the outputs every turn
 ViktorZafirovski: For example, I can just grab the outputs, paste them in a text editor locally and go through them
 KiwiTae: inputs
 ViktorZafirovski: Yeah, but that feels like cheating somehow.
 KiwiTae: lol
 KiwiTae: nah its not
 ViktorZafirovski: For some reason I feel like I should write code that will do the analysis for me and provide a solution.
 ViktorZafirovski: Which would work if the "Final Score" was fed back in
 ViktorZafirovski: But it isn't.
 ViktorZafirovski: So... yeah, I'mma have to dump these numbers.
 ableflyer: wanna check out my contribution<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7000332c182d089180745eb0b2e89ce77584">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7000332c182d089180745eb0b2e89ce77584</a>
 KiwiTae: ableflyer i think you can change difficulty to easy ~
 ableflyer:&#160;?
 KiwiTae: its about the complexity of a clash
 ableflyer: it took me 4 hours to get the solution
 ableflyer: is it actually easy for you?
 KiwiTae: about 3min lol
 ableflyer: looks like i need way more coding training than i thought
 Uljahn: :duck:
 Westicles: why is the output sorted?
 ableflyer: better reading
 ableflyer: for better reading of info
 ableflyer: ye
 Westicles: ok, but does it say to do that anywhere?
 ableflyer: wdym?
 Westicles: I mean in the description
 ableflyer: like at the solution
 ableflyer:&#160;?
 ableflyer: or the goal
 Westicles: I would have just printed them in order without sorting
 Westicles: At any rate, agree it is probably a clash
 AntiSquid: just had my 3rd COVID jab and grew an extra nipple as a bonus, i'm feeling great Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but not in my code
 Westicles: Your ovaries must be full now
 anantaCodes: Try taking ten jabs. You will be invincible. Maybe you can even dish out variants like pokemon cards
 AntiSquid: maybe you can poke-volve at that point
 Westicles: Squid, what do you think of that study on organ bio-distribution that shows it all collects in bone marrow and ovaries?  Just a bunch of BS for us wingnuts?
 AntiSquid: I would pay attention to everything now that people with side effects are completely ignored. As always do your own research.
 derjack: :thinking:
 wahyuawal: hi
 ableflyer: what should i do if i want to become a better programmer
 nickeyminasj: cry
 ableflyer: k
 nickeyminasj: practise more
 nickeyminasj: lol
 ViktorZafirovski: Ableflyer, pick a language you like an an environment you like then code actual use cases.
 ViktorZafirovski: Make a video game, code a calculator, pick a database and learn how to use it
 ViktorZafirovski: Get comfy with a system you like.
 ViktorZafirovski: Then, learn why everyone thinks that that system is shit and adapt.
 KP56: I would say that it depends on his current skills, if he already can create different projects, there is no need for him to practice stuff like databases etc especially if its not what he wants to do in the future.
 ViktorZafirovski: That is true, if he takes a career path into account.
 ViktorZafirovski: If he's just having fun... eh, doesn't really matter.
 ViktorZafirovski: Ableflyer, what do you actually want to do?
 ViktorZafirovski: Like, down the line
 KP56: For example I really enjoy graph theory and that's why I do some botting on this website&#160;:)
 ViktorZafirovski: Yeah, same. None of the stuff here applies to my job. 
 ViktorZafirovski: But god help me, it's so entertaining.
 KP56: The challenges this place offers are a lot different to what I've been doing before
 KiwiTae: part of my job is kindda bot programming so its spot on for me
 ViktorZafirovski: I would argue that none of these challenges actually have a real life counterpart that translates *directly*
 KP56: Unless you are a bot developer lmao
 ViktorZafirovski: But they teach you a ton of practices in between that are invaluable damn near everywhere
 ViktorZafirovski: I did custom autopilot software for drones back in the day and it was significantly easier than any of the game challenges here.
 KP56: That depends on your role, if someone does a lot of algorithmic stuff related to graphs, some of this experience may actually come in handy.
 ViktorZafirovski: Exactly. The methodologies are great.
 KP56: The only thing, which I don't like here is Clash of code. These challenges are way too easy and they seem more like a memorization game to me.
 KP56: But maybe it's just me
 ViktorZafirovski: No no, you're on point.
 KP56: I did one yesterday, when I created this account, and it was just looping through text and outputting indexes of characters, which were capital
 KP56: more of a speed typing contest if you ask me
 ViktorZafirovski: That's what it was like for me back in IT college
 ViktorZafirovski: First year, all the exams were "palindrome this, palindrome that"
 ViktorZafirovski: No joke.
 ViktorZafirovski: It was hellish&#160;:)
 KP56: I get you
 Westicles: Sounds like you guys are ready for the Horn-SAT solver
 ViktorZafirovski: Oh dear god
 ViktorZafirovski: This is hellish
 ViktorZafirovski: What is this thing
 ViktorZafirovski: †††
 KP56: I don't know what it means, probably because of the programming therminology I learned being in a different language
 ViktorZafirovski: He's referring to a challenge here on CG
 ViktorZafirovski: It's called that ^
 KP56: ah
 ViktorZafirovski: And it's hellish.
 KP56: haven't checked that out
 ViktorZafirovski: In formal logic, Horn-satisfiability, or Horn-SAT, is the problem of deciding whether a given Horn formula is satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Our purpose here is to code a program solving the Horn-SAT problem.
 ViktorZafirovski: Don't
 ViktorZafirovski: Hahahaha
 KP56: I've only solved a couple medium challenges
 KP56: yesterday
 KP56: I don't even know what "literal" means let me google it lmao
 KP56: oh ok i get it
 KP56: I may give it a try once I'm done with my move simulation in CODE vs ZOMBIES
 ViktorZafirovski: Now THAT's fun

 KP56:&#160;?
 relay: sup guys
 KP56: what about it
 relay: solutioun)
 relay: *
 KP56: you want a solution for it?
 relay: +
 KP56: so you don't know how to solve it and you need someone else to do it for you?
 relay: no i need help fo solution it
 BaNaNaVaN: shhh
 relay: bcs i can't do it by myself
 KP56: what don't you understand about the challenge
 relay: is it posseble?
 KP56: i solved it yesterday
 relay: so...
 KP56: so it is possible
 relay: *
 KP56: here is what i can tell you: you find a point which is the closest to coordinates 0, 0... then you look for the closest point to that one and connect these 2, if you move out of an orthant then you add a space
 relay: You think, that it help me?
 KP56: how far are you in this challenge
 relay: on star
 relay: t
 KP56: so you dont know how to begin coding?
 relay: )))
 KP56: first try getting the closest point to the origin
 KP56: here is the general formula for calculating the distance
 KP56: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance</a>
 KP56: (scroll to the geometry section)
 KP56: it's similar to pitagoras but you need to add all lengths in other dimensions squared too
 KiwiTae: its the euclidian distance, just the size of the hypersphere radius
 nickeyminasj: hi can anyone help
 KP56: what's your problem?
 nickeyminasj: when i print with else it does it wrongly
 nickeyminasj: like
 nickeyminasj: i do print(*x if x else 'Pangram')
 nickeyminasj: so i print the values inside x
 nickeyminasj: but when it prints pangram
 KP56: unfortunetly i don't know python D:
 nickeyminasj: it prints it space separated as well
 nickeyminasj: rip
 KiwiTae: its normal
 Uljahn: print(*x if x else 'Pangram', sep="")
 nickeyminasj: oh wow thank you

 Nekko551XD: i am just wondering one thing for puzzle two eggs shouldn't solution for 1000 be 44 tries since if its increased by 50 it  takes it 20 tries to reach 1000 and then it takes it 24 tries to test numbers from 2 to 48 since 0 and 50 would already be tested 
 Nekko551XD: so 24+20 =44 and not 45 and 44&lt;45
 Culyssander: HiHow to find a first remote job

 kyoya34: helllo
 Nekko551XD: did something change here solutions are available only for language you complete the puzzle in&#160;? was it always like this 
 struct: no, you used to be able to see all, but that was a long time ago
 Nekko551XD: OK, i started thinking i may be imagining things and that wouldn't be the best since i am still too young for it XD

 ZLiesPython: What did you do
 ableflyer: i got kicked from this chat cuz I posted a private clash of clans in here
 ableflyer: cloash of code*
 ableflyer: clash of code**
 ZLiesPython: Ohhh
 ZLiesPython: so a solution
 ableflyer: no no no
 ableflyer: a private clash of code
 ableflyer: i din't post any solutions
 KiwiTae: ableflyer you can do that in #clash
 ableflyer: i did
 ableflyer: i clicked the hashtag and posted it here
 ableflyer: at the #clash chat
 LazyMammal: Nekko551XDre: Two Egg ProblemYou try every 50th floor to 1000 (20 drops). Egg finally breaks at 1000. Now one egg to test floor 951..999 (49 drops). Total 69
 KiwiTae: LazyMammal you can solve it in 1line
 LazyMammal: I was answering Nekko's question from earlier.
 KiwiTae: aaa
 KiwiTae: my baddd hehe
 KP56: wasn't it like an hour ago?
 LazyMammal: Correct answer is 45 not 69 anyway.
 Wontonimo: time is meaningless on CG
 Nekko551XD: does second egg need to survive?
 LazyMammal: Nope.  Two eggs to spend.
 Nekko551XD: i will test every second floor so i tested 50 it didn't break i now test 52 if it breaks it's 51 if not i continue 
 LazyMammal: Every second floor only works if you still have two eggs to spend.  Can't do that after going every 50th floor.
 Nekko551XD: i test by 50 floors while both eggs are alive 
 Nekko551XD: one breaks at 1000th floor 
 LazyMammal: Yes, and "worst case" is it breaks at top.  So one egg left.
 Nekko551XD: now i am left with one egg and floors between 950 and 1000 since it survived 950 and died at 1000
 LazyMammal: yep
 Nekko551XD: and i dont have to test 950 and 1000 since i already know result for those 2 
 LazyMammal: correct
 Nekko551XD: and why i cant increase height by 2 if i can spend both eggs to find result 
 LazyMammal: you have one egg at this point
 Nekko551XD: yes and&#160;?
 LazyMammal: so you can't skip floor and still learn exact floor.  you would only be "within 2"
 Nekko551XD: if it breaks at 52 i know 51 was its max since 50 was survived and 52 was death
 Nekko551XD: and i always know previous result so its single number
 LazyMammal: We know:  didn't break at 950.  If we test at 952 and it breaks ... what about 951?  we don't know
 Nekko551XD: do you get now what i am trying to say 
 Nekko551XD: yea now i got it 
 Nekko551XD: my fault wrong misconception 
 Nekko551XD: thanks for explaining
 LazyMammal: It's a confusing problem.  No worries.  Also, pro tip:  you are checking fixed step up the floors but that isn't optimal.
 kyoya34: hello
 LazyMammal: welcome
 KP56: in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander</a> does the mars lander lose horizontal speed too?
 LazyMammal: No air friction in Mars Lander.  Only gravity and engine thrust.
 KP56: then I had to mess the calculations up, thanks
 LazyMammal: If you are making a simulation, don't forget to average acceleration when adding to velocity.  Look up "Verlet integration" for reason why.
 KP56: it may be useful, thank you
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0132e6c5-180f-4c82-8803-cd10986759cd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0132e6c5-180f-4c82-8803-cd10986759cd</a>
 jacek: oO
 LazyMammal: That makes more sense.  I actually looked at my code and I'm not doing Verlet at all.  So that was a red herring&#160;!
 Wontonimo: i've been daydreaming about making a verlet physics multi on CG
 Wontonimo: is the Mars lander ref code available on github&#160;?
 LazyMammal: I've never found an official repo for Mars Lander.
 KiwiTae: they didnt release it

 masknksnvsndvo: do most ppl think python is the best language
 Learning2CodeButIAintGotWings: python is easier than most imo, but i'm using this to brush up on my c
 Andriamanitra: @masknksnvsndvo no&#160;:) python is the second best language for everything
 General_Imaginaer: there are only tools in a big tool box inside the cloud ....
 Andriamanitra: and if you ask 10 people what's the best language you'll likely get at least 6 different languages :D
 KP56: python is a very good language as it allows you to make a lot of complicated instructions within a small amount of code lines
 KP56: but i wouldn't say it's the best
 KP56: if we take a recursive fib implementation for python and c++ for example (it's terrible do it iteratively), c++ executes the same code 25x faster than python
 KP56: that's because of python being terrible for recursive solutions
 masknksnvsndvo: what's the best language then Andriamanitra
 masknksnvsndvo: KP56 you make a good point
 Learning2CodeButIAintGotWings: i think you have to define what you think best is, easiest to implement, fastest, best graphical libraries, etc
 masknksnvsndvo: well I mean in everyday programming
 Andriamanitra: @KP56 yes python has function call overhead but it's far from being terrible for recursive solutions - most of the time you can/want to memoize it anyway, deep recursion stacks are not a good thing in any language - and let's be real, language speed doesn't matter in 95% of the cases
 masknksnvsndvo: if you had to only choose 1 lanugage
 Andriamanitra: if i only had to choose one i would pick python because like i said it's the second best language for everything
 Learning2CodeButIAintGotWings: if i had to do all my code in one language, i would probably choose python....
 KP56: @Andriamanitra you are right, I was just giving an example where python is a worse option
 General_Imaginaer: if i can only chosse 1 language&#160;? i would choice assembler and would build all the languages again xD
 masknksnvsndvo: lmao
 Andriamanitra: there is almost infinite amount of packages for python which is a HUGE benefit - that said i usually choose another language that fits the task at hand better
 KP56: i personally think python is the most universal language out of the ones ive heard about
 Andriamanitra: julia (for sciencey/math/stats/plots stuff) and crystal (for command line / web apps) are my current favorites
 Learning2CodeButIAintGotWings: no matlab love for the science/math/plots?
 Andriamanitra: julia syntax is very similar to matlab but not insane, and it's open source :p
 Andriamanitra: so a no-brainer of a choice there - although i can see the appeal of the matlab ide
 Wontonimo: hey KiwiTae&#160;!  That's right, I am no longer Grand, just a regular Master lol
 Wontonimo: KP56 - do you want some hints for Coders Strikes Back?
 General_Imaginaer: just a regular Master&#160;? uffff i thought this time is over ^^

 JimmyJams: anyone here ever put their shirt on backwards 4 times in a row?
 VicVic777: i got a java technical interview tomorrow and i can barely do the medium exercises, should i give up
 KiwiTae: NO 
 KiwiTae: VicVic777 just go do your best , better fail the test than not showing up for it
 VicVic777: i'm spiralling so hard, its a junior position and it would be my first job but i can't even do DSA stuff without googling
 KiwiTae: seniors google too
 VicVic777: “He suffers more than necessary, who suffers before it is necessary”
 Wontonimo: The medium exercises here are hard VicVic777 
 Wontonimo: I think I used to budget two half days to solve a medium exercise (that initially looks like something I feel I could solve).  Sometimes I surprise myself and get it done way faster, but it wasn't something I would count on.  I haven't attempted a puzzle for a while, focusing more on bot multis now
 eulerscheZahl: i would say the "hard" ones are actually medium when I compare it to other websites like codeforces
 Wontonimo: I haven't used codeforces
 sprkrd: is the tourist from codingame the same tourist from codeforces (2nd in the codeforces ranking)
 sprkrd:&#160;?
 sprkrd: yeah, it's definitively the same person
 DomiKo: yes he is
 sprkrd: and he's also the 1st in top coder
 sprkrd: i wonder, does he do something in his life other than competitive programming? :joy:
 General_Imaginaer: maybe its the one thing he can do
 sprkrd: apparently he also plays tennis
 General_Imaginaer: but play he good tennis xD?
 General_Imaginaer: its like me , i solve puzzle here , but i am good&#160;? i think no :P
 sprkrd: the least i can say is he doesn't play tennis as well as he solve programming problems
 General_Imaginaer: maybe he is Novak Djokovic
 General_Imaginaer: or ashleigh Barty
 sprkrd: i'm not a tennis connoisseur, so that went way over my head :joy:
 General_Imaginaer: I only use google xD
 sprkrd: i only know Rafael Nadal and that's because he's from my country
 sprkrd: otherwise I wouldn't even know about him
 General_Imaginaer: hmm on the other side he can't play the whole day tennis , he need breaks ... maybe in this time he solves coding puzzles xD
 KP56: imagine
 jacek: meow
 eulerscheZahl: to answer your question about tourist: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/coder/tourist/">https://clist.by/coder/tourist/</a>

 eulerscheZahl: win what?
 jacek: yes
 kovi: germany vs. hungary
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, that's today
 eulerscheZahl: did it start already?
 kovi: in 5mins
 Marchete: don't you play football?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: but watching is meh
 kovi: i know the odds of course
 jacek: football? or... soccer :thinking:
 Marchete: :soccer::runner:
 eulerscheZahl: and they live in their own world anyways. whole country in a lockdown and they already play matches again and want spectators. why should i cheer for these egocentric millionaris?
 Marchete: lockdown?
 eulerscheZahl: last year
 Marchete: it seems much more relaxed now
 Marchete: ah
 eulerscheZahl: but when we were still in the middle of it, couldn't even meet another household, they had training like normal
 Marchete: lockdown is for plebs
 eulerscheZahl: personally I don't care if Germany advances to the next round
 eulerscheZahl: on the one hand i like those completely empty public areas during the matches
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand the earlier they drop out, the sooner the media coverage stops
 Marchete: too many hands
 sprkrd: only two hands&#160;:/
 Marchete: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and politics always uses these events to speak in some stupid ideas and turn it into a law
 sprkrd: he used all his hands
 Marchete: "on the one hand " I never heard that before
 Marchete: just the other hand
 sprkrd: that one is correct
 KP56: yeah
 Marchete: I guess
 sprkrd: sounds weird
 eulerscheZahl: it's a common saying
 sprkrd: to us foreigners, but is common
 KP56: it's also not a thing in my language, but i've heard it before
 eulerscheZahl: look up "57 Sekunden Gesetz"passing a law that allows the government to sell information about citizens to companies
 KP56: wtf
 eulerscheZahl: happened during a previous european championship
 KP56: WHAT
 KP56: what's wrong with people who made it a thing
 General_Imaginaer: what&#160;? wait&#160;? they sell our information&#160;?
 Marchete: "facebook": loool, I have it for free!
 eulerscheZahl: and passed in just 57s, sneaky politicians
 Marchete: indeed
 Marchete: Spain is not different
 sprkrd: spain is worse
 sprkrd: btw, i'm not from Catalonia actually, Marchete, so rest easy that i won't rant about spain :D
 Marchete: phew!
 eulerscheZahl: Marchete lived in Mexico for a while
 Marchete: a while == 14 years
 eulerscheZahl: that long? :o
 Marchete: I went for a couple of years
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it was just for a job, a few months
 Marchete: guess what? it wasn't
 Marchete: nope
 sprkrd: yeah, started your own cartel and everything
 Marchete: :D
 sprkrd: hard to come back after that
 eulerscheZahl: takes a while to set that up
 Marchete: exactly 14 years
 eulerscheZahl: breaking bad is partially based on Marchete's life
 sprkrd: Actually your original nickname was Machete
 eulerscheZahl: it hated those episodes where they speak Spanish 50% of the episode
 sprkrd: but it made it far to obvious who you actually are
 eulerscheZahl: i get that it's more realistic and all. but i don't want to read subtitles that long
 Marchete: learn spanish, ezpz

 Marchete: I can't even spell euler's name, that's my German level
 eulerscheZahl: ¡Ándale! ¡Ándale! ¡Arriba! ¡Arriba! ¡Epa! ¡Epa! ¡Epa! Yeehaw!
 sprkrd: Yeehaw is more cowboyish
 eulerscheZahl: that's speedy gonzales
 General_Imaginaer: Die schnellste Maus von Mexico&#160;!!!
 General_Imaginaer: wupps
 eulerscheZahl: and from a classmate i've learned "las manos arriva. esto es un robbo"
 sprkrd: I appreciate you bothered to look for the opening exclamation marks ¡¡¡
 eulerscheZahl: i copied the whole thing from wikipedia
 sprkrd: Ah, then you see, Yeehaw! does not come with an opening exclamation mark
 sprkrd: that's because that's more of an american thing U_U
 sprkrd: My german comes entirely from rammstein songs
 General_Imaginaer: can you sing a rammstein song for us&#160;:)?
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't astrobytes also like Rammstein?
 darkhorse64: wollt ihr das bett in flammen sehen&#160;?
 General_Imaginaer: ^^
 sprkrd: General_Imaginaer I can sing, but you won't be able to hear me
 eulerscheZahl: go to discord then
 General_Imaginaer: hehe
 sprkrd: maybe another day, i'm feeling a bit sad today, not quite in the mood for singing
 General_Imaginaer: thats perfect for rammstein
 sprkrd: for rammstein the perfect mood is angry
 General_Imaginaer: it depends , its not only angry
 sprkrd: mein herz brennt
 General_Imaginaer: yeah is a sad song , its only singed angry
 eulerscheZahl: is that your mood or a quote of the song?
 eulerscheZahl: if the first, you should see a doctor ASAP
 sprkrd: it's just the title of the song :joy:
 jacek: schmetterling :rage:
 General_Imaginaer: haha , krankenwagen&#160;!
 darkhorse64: ich tu dir weh 
 darkhorse64: really angry, now
 General_Imaginaer: its a song about a dude that can't feel pain and must punish other people ... well you can interpret it as sad
 General_Imaginaer: punish=torture
 darkhorse64: es tut mir nicht leid, yes, you can view it as a sad sog
 darkhorse64: song
 QuickMathzs: hermitcraft s8 started
 sprkrd: i guess if you want a song by rammstein that is undeniable sad you have mutter and ohne dich
 sprkrd: undeniably*
 sprkrd: but those are more the exception rather than the rule
 General_Imaginaer: thats funny , because mutter is a war declaration xD
 General_Imaginaer: and ohne dich is about: nostalgia, desire
 jacek: german language :scream:
 General_Imaginaer: mutter is about desire too ...
 sprkrd: i guess i didn't get the meaning about mutter then
 sprkrd: then again, german is not my forte
 General_Imaginaer: in mutter they sing about, he never had a mother ..... he sing about what he needed but never became.. and at last he sing about how mutch he hate her for that ^^
 General_Imaginaer: And that he want hurt her
 General_Imaginaer: ofcourse it is sad ... but that is the point with rammstein songs .... the most are sad backgrounds but they change this sadness in aggression
 General_Imaginaer: have sad background
 AntiSquid: where's the enjoyment in that?
 General_Imaginaer: in the songs&#160;?
 sprkrd: are you asking why make sad songs instead of doing happy songs? :thinking:
 General_Imaginaer: I think the enjoyment in rammstein is .... you feel this strongness .... Its not like the other staff you can hear but it is mainstream.
 AntiSquid: isn't that a completely different question&#160;?
 BERNARB01: how to disable shortest mode in clash of code?
 General_Imaginaer: And  a other part is ... you change the sadness in strongness
 sprkrd: yeah, it was a different question, i thought maybe you were implying there's no enjoyment at all, so why bother
 sprkrd: i tried to jump ahead your thought process&#160;:)
 sprkrd: BERNARB01 you can't, afaik
 sprkrd: you have to live with that
 sprkrd: cross your fingers so the next one isn't shortest mode
 AntiSquid: yes well you probably also assume the source and type of happiness
 AntiSquid: for example candy shop can be considered a happy song
 General_Imaginaer: this song from 50 cent ^^&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes

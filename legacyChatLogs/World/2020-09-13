 Marchete: Item* i = myVector[0];
 Marchete: myVector.push_back( something);
 Marchete: and now the pointer is no longer valid
 Marchete: \o/
 Marchete: god bless f*cking C++
 Allis: @Marchete That makes sense, though; growing a vector can cause a reallocation, which in turn might involve a move.
 Marchete: I know it makes sense
 Marchete: but in C# and similar is simpler
 Marchete: also, in debug mode they should warn in some way
 Marchete: the compiler should detect that something is wrong
 Allis: According to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/analyzer/checkers.html#cplusplus-innerpointer-c">https://clang.llvm.org/docs/analyzer/checkers.html#cplusplus-innerpointer-c</a>, Clang's static analyzer can only detect invalidated pointers on std::string.
 Allis: That indicates that they're aware of the issue and making it work for std::vector and other collections is a hard problem.
 Marchete: well, almost a day wasted in this
 Allis: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Marchete: :expressionless:
 Marchete: and Illedan_ dropped me in ktulu, not happy today
 fazli1702: kanina cao ci bai
 dbdr: Marchete: that invalid pointer is a typical example of what rust fixes in C++: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/lO1z-7cuRYI?t=782">https://youtu.be/lO1z-7cuRYI?t=782</a>
 Marchete: good bless smart compilers
 Marchete: Rust sounds interesting, but I can't see a similar sintaxis to neither C++ or C#
 Marchete: I code in c++ very similar to what I do in C# (and that's why I struggle with it), but Rust is like a new whole deal
 dbdr: C# and C++ are also different, no
 dbdr:&#160;?
 Marchete: but I code similarly
 dbdr: yes, I see how that will lead to crashes in C++
 Marchete: I mean, I do some dirty C++ that is fast, but looks like a lot to I do in C# :D
 Marchete: what*
 Marchete: C# is like "wow you are trying to pass a red light, I got you bro"
 Marchete: and C++ is like "without brakes!!!! go brrrrrr!!!"
 Marchete: I fixed my chain split, but now I need to see what is happening in border boxes
 Marchete: in corners

 jacek: so silent in here
 jacek: i thought people would be more hyped
 GoogleJeff: I'm totally hyped
 Marchete: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 GoogleJeff: HYPE
 jacek: yay silver
 Thiesjoo: Nice jacek!
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: when i submit my stuff in c#, this ruby and python all ways win this shit. because of few characters they get. 
 uvBoss: calm down dude
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: bring c#9 then i will win, maybe i need use F# to win
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: F# &gt; ruby and python
 Simonka: *laughs in python*
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: @admin bring c#9 man
 jacek: the problem is you bring knife to a gun fight
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: yeah i know. LOL
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: i just want play this can in c# for now. later i will paly it  with F#.
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: but c# 9.0 is as good as python but faster.
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: oh shit, for the first just now i used less char in the code then a  python ohhhh okkk.
 ChandraKanthPasunuru: it put me in top of lobby board.
 Marchete: ahh Sokoban, how much I hate this game
 eulerscheZahl: :head_bandage
 eulerscheZahl: :head_bandage:
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should have finished it before putting as WIP
 eulerscheZahl: now that one use keeps commenting
 Astrobytes: lol, you made Sokoban
 eulerscheZahl: not finished yet
 eulerscheZahl: just started this morning before playing soccer
 Westicles: Ah, Sokoban.  If you are looking for some with thousands of moves there are some good ones here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://sokoban-gild.com/records.cgi">http://sokoban-gild.com/records.cgi</a>
 eulerscheZahl: thousands of moves is a problem with the CG SDK
 eulerscheZahl: except if i ask the user to issue multiple actions per turn
 eulerscheZahl: and i think sokoban is better as a puzzle than optim anyways
 eulerscheZahl: so it doesn't have to be too hard
 Westicles: Sounds good.  Incidentally, the guy behind that website claims to have the fast solver in the world, he links to it (c code) in the description
 eulerscheZahl: that would make an optim pointless, wouldn't it? :D
 Westicles: Yeah, for an optim I think it would have to be designing levels
 eulerscheZahl: sokoban multiplayer: you get some initial board and can add walls to it
 eulerscheZahl: then you solve the board of your opponent
 eulerscheZahl: i'll show the door to myself. no need Marchete :D
 Marchete: bender4 isn't already sokoban on steroids?
 Marchete: it's not your fault
 Marchete: I remember some old sokoban in CGA graphics
 Marchete: and I hated it
 Marchete: since then
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NamVt6CEXjA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NamVt6CEXjA</a>
 Marchete: yeah this one
 eulerscheZahl: i agree, bender and sokoban share some similarities
 eulerscheZahl: and space maze
 Marchete: I made this meme
 Westicles: That video makes me nostalgic for Ultima IV
 eulerscheZahl: damn you SDK
 eulerscheZahl: BufferedGroup isn't working well with setScale
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/ugi3tl">https://prnt.sc/ugi3tl</a>drawing an image larger than the player height (1080px) and scaling it downnow there's a black bottom
 Zenoscave: JBM you mad genius
 JBM: huh?
 Zenoscave: ALL GLORY TO EULER
 JBM: oh that
 Zenoscave: I knew what video would play but still I clicked it
 JBM: you knew you wanted to
 Zenoscave: I had to be sure
 eulerscheZahl: that's an old one, surprised you haven't seen it before :D
 Zenoscave: I don't have enough time to check contributions these days
 JBM: well at least you knew a video was coming up
 Zenoscave: html5 == video
 Zenoscave: invariably
 JBM: yeah that's the shortcut
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl new optim?
 Zenoscave: what's that mario-esque looking printscr
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle, not optim
 Zenoscave: ah interesting
 Zenoscave: block pusher puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: you know sokoban, don't you?
 Zenoscave: not by that name but I probably can guess the task
 Zenoscave: lmgtfy

 Zenoscave: no jacek
 eulerscheZahl: now you lost me
 Zenoscave: I see it now. How many levels are you porting/plan to port
 eulerscheZahl: 30
 Zenoscave: cool
 eulerscheZahl: and i found a bug in the SDK
 JBM: what a surprise
 eulerscheZahl: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: will report it later
 lior5654: why is this such a meme, use codeforces instead
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces has a different audience than codingame
 eulerscheZahl: the unique thing here is the multiplayer section
 lior5654: yeah I just saw clash of code
 lior5654: it's really fun
 lior5654: but
 lior5654: the problems are wayy too trivial
 lior5654: no graph theory, trees, geometry etc
 eulerscheZahl: that's meant for a short break, nothing serious
 lior5654: I see
 eulerscheZahl: the normal puzzle section can be harder
 lior5654: I se
 lior5654: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yet if you want to practice the standard algos like you need them for ICPC, you're better placed at codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: if you want interaction of your program with other programs, try one of these: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 lior5654: shortest code is not fair against c++ users?
 lior5654: in clash of code
 lior5654: I use a 3000 lines template
 lior5654: I finish first but get like 4th because of stupid python users
 SPDene: just switch to ruby and beat them
 Hjax: part of the game is selecting the right tool for the job 
 lior5654: python is too slow tho
 Hjax: and your 3000 line template is definitely not it
 lior5654: I use c++, just like most ICPC / IOI contestants
 SPDene: speed isn't important in reverse mode
 Hjax: its clash, execution speed doesnt really matter 
 Hjax: if you want execution speed to matter, go play a search heavy multi
 lior5654: for example, there was a round in which I finished in 1:50 
 lior5654: A python user with 9:17 got before me
 lior5654: not execution speed
 lior5654: time took to finish
 Hjax: well, obviously someone is going to use their time 
 Hjax: its a code golf puzzle
 Hjax: finishing super fast is just a mistake 
 lior5654: yes, but speed should mattter..
 Hjax: it does in the other modes
 lior5654: I guess that's the rules of the game
 lior5654: oh really? noice
 SPDene: I'm not sure you understand the criteria for winningshortest. It's about the number of characters in your code. speed isn't important 
 Hjax: reverse and fastest care about how quickly you answer 
 Hjax: shortest cares about code size
 lior5654: so in shortest I should even avoid spaces?
 lior5654: lmao
 Hjax: if possible
 lior5654: sounds cool
 lior5654: thanks
 Astrobytes: I've seen a lot on CG but a 3000 line template for shortest CoC is a first :D
 Hjax: lol agreed
 eulerscheZahl: be careful about the 100k char limit
 lior5654: aight I took your advice
 lior5654: this time I was abit slow but 100 char python code
 lior5654: and I am first
 lior5654: so yeah that works I guess
 eulerscheZahl: are the others still playing?
 eulerscheZahl: then you might still drop
 lior5654: oh wait there are 8 minutes left
 lior5654: oops
 Astrobytes: Gotta use the right tools for the job, and pay attention too&#160;;)
 lior5654: I might fall on int(input())
 lior5654: is there a shorter way
 Astrobytes: lesson learned!
 lior5654: to get an integer from stdin?
 lior5654: (in python
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 lior5654: I did s,b,g=(int(input(),int(input(),int(input())
 eulerscheZahl: usually Ruby is a bit shorter
 eulerscheZahl: oh, then you can improve it
 lior5654: that's the shortest input receival I thought of
 Hjax: you can do tricks like 
 Hjax: a=input
 eulerscheZahl: s,b,g=map(int,input().split())
 Hjax: a(), a(), a()
 Hjax: code golf often makes me wish "lambda" was a shorter word 
 lior5654: I am a C++ programmer, did not know aout these
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's 3 lines, not 1 lines with 3 numbers
 lior5654: yeah someone wrote code 12 characters shorter than mine
 lior5654: oof
 lior5654: ah smart
 eulerscheZahl: some users learned python or ruby just for golfing
 lior5654: he used a lambda
 lior5654: f=lambda:int(input())
 eulerscheZahl: others learned C++ for the bot section
 lior5654: euler do you have a codeforces handle
 lior5654: I just checked your CoC profile
 lior5654: impressive
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl">https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: CoC?
 lior5654: oh I meant
 lior5654: codinggame
 lior5654: Coc is clahs of code
 lior5654: whoops
 eulerscheZahl: nowadays i'm mostly doing contests and idling in the chat when there is no contest
 Hjax: euler is frequently #1 on this site 
 Hjax: although it seems royale has passed him again 
 lior5654: what are rankings based upon
 eulerscheZahl: click the ranking
 Hjax: mostly bot programming and contests
 eulerscheZahl: then you see the score for each category (you can further expand them)
 Pablo_: @euler do you have a programming job aswell?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 lior5654: are achievements bugged?
 eulerscheZahl: no. sometimes they take a bit to update
 theBatman: Are there bots in every Coc match?

 Astrobytes: only if there are too few human players
 eulerscheZahl: the top few are bots (with 40k+ games)

 Astrobytes: (I let you do that btw, not feeling fast today :P )
 Hjax: most of them 
 Hjax: oh scroll 
 eulerscheZahl: somehow that's what I was expecting Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Q12: How to limit the run time of program? like that the player would not be able to run a program that her run time is bigger than the limit, in contribution
 eulerscheZahl: are you talking about SDK contributions or classic input-output based?
 Q12: I don't know what is SDK I'm taking about an easy puzzle
 Q12: *talking
 eulerscheZahl: with any animations or alike?
 Q12: no
 eulerscheZahl: you have to take what CG offers you then
 eulerscheZahl: which is 1s to produce some output
 jacek: 3. take it or leave it
 Q12: haha
 Q12: Thanks eulerscheZahl 
 eulerscheZahl: after that 1s the user program is terminated and it's counted as wrong answer
 Q12: So I can just make the input bigger and it would do the same right?
 Astrobytes: I guess if it's an efficiency thing you could make a larger test case of some arbitrary size that should be solvable in less than 1s 
 Q12: its like limit the run time
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Q12: thanks
 lior5654: clash of code in shortest code mode is basically "use js or ruby or be bad"
 geppoz: +python
 Astrobytes: you can always make a private clash and choose the mode + language
 geppoz: hint: learn 2 languages, one for short, one for fast
 geppoz: i.e. python+javascript
 JBM: not sure which is which oO
 geppoz: for me pytohn short, js fast
 tssw: js fast?
 geppoz: fast to solve problems, not to execute
 geppoz:&#160;;)
 lior5654: for me either c++ or python for fast , depends on input manipulation
 lior5654: python for shortest
 BitThief: python shortest, python or js for fast
 lior5654: I breathe c++
 Elysweyr: js is also quite short
 Elysweyr: but you need to know what you are doing xD
 Elysweyr: and functional problems are much more convenient in js
 Elysweyr: (compared to python!)
 tomy00019: (c++ for faster compilation secure)

 eulerscheZahl: i'm utterly confused
 eulerscheZahl: seemed fine in testing. when i saved it, i got that nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I think I understand what's going on: there must be some caching in the testcases. I changed the input format. If my new parser tries to read the old files, it will be something like this

 eulerscheZahl: thanks AntiSquid. I reported it on discord, will move it to github
 AntiSquid: every * Q_Q
 eulerscheZahl: the maps in the old format start withwidth height
 eulerscheZahl: and the new parser assumes a single line and assumes that anything &gt;= 6 is a pusher
 eulerscheZahl: as width and height both are, you get 2 of them :D
 eulerscheZahl: if you download and reupload my zip file, it should be working fine

 Hjax: @MadKnight Code of Kutulu
 Hjax: playing the unofficial contest
 Hjax: im mid gold right now 
 blasterpoard: I'm looking at new kutulu legend games right now; people still don't spam light properly
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/486847086">https://www.codingame.com/replay/486847086</a>
 Hjax: my bot is super bad right now, im surprised its gold 
 blasterpoard: you can get to gold while ignoring slashers
 Hjax: i told my bot to try to avoid standing on their line of sight 
 Hjax: but that was it 
 Hjax: its not aware of their timers or states at all 
 blasterpoard: that's better than almost anyone in silver
 Hjax: my scoring is awful, my bot walks into danger a lot 
 blasterpoard: what kind of danger?
 blasterpoard: getting surrounded or missing unavoidable damage at depth 1-2?
 Hjax: wanderers mostly 
 Hjax: it will see wanderers on both sides and not realize it can slip through 
 Hjax: sometimes it just stands still or turns around and walks into a wanderer :D 
 blasterpoard: voronoi turned out to be a good heuristic for avoiding getting boxed in
 blasterpoard: and some sort of a simulation that is just a couple of turns deep is nice to have
 Hjax: yeah i dont have any sort of sim 
 Hjax: i just have a trash heuristic that scores all legal moves 
 blasterpoard: I think depth 5 was good because of slasher phases
 blasterpoard: *good enough
 Hjax: and picks whatever optimizes its scoring function best
 Hjax: but the scoring function isnt particularly good 
 blasterpoard: that can get far enough too; that's how my bot at rank 6 works
 Hjax: i need some way better heuristics if i want this method to work without a search 
 Hjax: its hard to strike a balance of avoiding wanderers and being near other explorers 
 blasterpoard: aren't the other explorers avoiding wanderers too though?
 Hjax: not really 
 blasterpoard: avoiding wanderers and staying with the others should be the same thing
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/486909471">https://www.codingame.com/replay/486909471</a>
 Hjax: i die alone while everyone else eats wanderers 
 blasterpoard: you don't need to follow everyone, just someone
 blasterpoard: yes, both your bot and blue bot play badly, but the correct way to play that map is to just go to the closest explorer
 blasterpoard: and whenever it's "2v2", keep spamming light as much as possible
 Hjax: i feel like light is less of a concern than how trash my movement is 
 blasterpoard: light is important
 blasterpoard: I posted a reaply a while back
 Hjax: i saw it 
 blasterpoard: simply make sure to go to whoever is closest in the early game, and if multiple people are equally distant from you, go to the one that's closer to your position 1 turn back
 blasterpoard: that's the best you can do for first ~6 turns
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/486911583">https://www.codingame.com/replay/486911583</a>
 Hjax: well that is better
 blasterpoard: yes, that's how you should do it
 blasterpoard: even if blue wasn't very cooperative
 Hjax: my bot doesnt really know how to avoid slashers if they are near it 
 blasterpoard: just note that light lasts longer than 2 turns
 blasterpoard: you need sim for that
 Hjax: it didnt want to leave blue
 Hjax: but blue didnt want to leave the slahers
 Hjax: slashers*
 blasterpoard: don't worry about that, bots higher up on the leaderboard will play along more
 Hjax: what do you mean light lasts longer than 2 turns? 
 blasterpoard: you keep cancelling one light with another
 Hjax: doesnt look like it 
 Hjax: i have light for 6 turns 
 Hjax: each light lasts for 2 
 blasterpoard: ok, then I must be misremembering
 blasterpoard: it's plan that lasts 4
 Hjax: i should probably only light if theres a wanderer thats path would be affected by it 
 blasterpoard: yes, and you used it too soon and took extra isolation dmg because of it
 AnyaA: how do I beat boss 2 in wood 2 league in coders strike back javascript?
 Hjax: theres no correct answer to that question 
 Hjax: make your bot better and it will win

 JimmyJams: dude
 JimmyJams: why can people not write validators?
 JimmyJams: a solid 1/4 of clashes have validators that don't match their tests at all
 JimmyJams: why are moderators approving these? There should be some feedback going on here.
 Westicles: Because the moderators are a bunch of teenage nimrods?
 GarethEddies: that's a bit harsh, only some of them are...
 Westicles: The posse that have been approving everything this last month certainly are
 nightmarex: @Husoski wow, thank you for the tip!! (Sorry, I was afk and couldn't respond&#160;:( )
 Plantchant: hi
 Husoski: Using a list instead of a dict makes a ton of sense.  Wish I thought of it.
 ableflyer: how do you sort a dictionary if the values were floats
 fvla: ableflyer if you're sorting a dictionary by values, you're probably doing something wrong
 ableflyer: im sorting by items
 fvla: keys?
 fvla: so it looks like you're using python
 ableflyer: yes
 fvla: there's definitely no difference between sorting ints and floats
 ableflyer: but it gave me an error saying float is not subscriptable
 fvla: that means that the interpreter read some part of your code as follows:
 fvla: you're trying to subscript a floating point number
 fvla: it's surely a mistake in your program's logic
 ableflyer: what can i do to change it so that it's no longer a floating point number
 fvla: no idea
 ableflyer: ok
 fvla: it's your code, and i can't tell more without more information

 GarethEddies: ChiefChippy2, you around&#160;?
 GarethEddies: maybe someone else can help&#160;? what does "Binary output" mean in a contribution comment&#160;?
 GarethEddies: because the output is true / false&#160;?
 darkhorse64: yes
 GarethEddies: people don't like it because you can randomize it&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hi, I just succeed on ML2 with GA
 MiyamuraIzumi: although, not quite optimal :D
 darkhorse64: the issue with binary is hat you can achieve 50% just by issuing true
 darkhorse64: *that*
 GarethEddies: but not 100%
 darkhorse64: The guidelines explicitely state that binary output puzzles must be rejected
 GarethEddies: oh
 GarethEddies: I must have missed that
 GarethEddies: I'll rethink it
 darkhorse64: MiyamuraIzumi: gg. Did you get the third achievement&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: darkhorse64, I already achieve it since Heuristic version
 darkhorse64: OK. So optimize more and score CP points with the optimization puzzle

 Mr_BlueBird: he copied my code and submitted
 Mr_BlueBird: in clash of code
 envifly: are you sure its not a bot
 JohnCM: oh how is that possible?
 Mr_BlueBird: can you believe it?
 Mr_BlueBird: i don't know
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am super man
 JohnCM: yea sometimes bots do have similar code, as they just take a random sample code 
 envifly: bots copy peoples code i think
 MiyamuraIzumi: can you believe it?
 ableflyer: he probably used another account to copy the code
 Mr_BlueBird: no he is not a bot
 Mr_BlueBird: no bro
 Mr_BlueBird: i have only one account
 ableflyer: i meant JS53
 Mr_BlueBird: yeah
 Mr_BlueBird: maybe
 Mr_BlueBird: btw, I ask him, you know what he said?JS53: I didn't copy, I just typed anything
 ableflyer: bruh moment
 Mr_BlueBird: hehehe
 CA3SAR: yo @envifly do u remember that number one
 CA3SAR: what was the pattern in it? 
 CA3SAR: i never figured it out

 KiwiTae: Mr_BlueBird some clash of code are so simple its possible for 2 players to have the same code to solve them
 Nekko551XD: especially if it's shortest mode
 MiyamuraIzumi: yeah
 ableflyer: i mean @Kiwitea is not lying here
 lolgube: i'm new here, but i'm guessing you can't look up the solution for a clash of code after it's done?
 TORIBON: You can look at other people's code if they decided to share it, at the score screen
 TORIBON: Not sure if you can look at an actual solution, kinda new here as well
 aCat: you can see actual solution if you find the actual puzzle at the contribution subpage
 aCat: you can also ask some other people after the clash to share their coed
 Mr_BlueBird: can anyone tell me how to take list input in stub generator input?
 Uljahn: hmm, i can't see solutions for approved clashes, only for puzzles
 Mr_BlueBird: i am creating puzzle

 Mr_BlueBird: how to take space separated string input? in stub generator input?
 Mr_BlueBird: plz help me :cry:
 Uljahn: Mr_BlueBird: why are you so obsessed with contributions? have you solved all existing puzzles already?

 Westicles: Don't Panic golf now updated.  I lost 12/27
 tobk: already noticed the code golf puzzles popping up in my "latest activity". What changed?
 Westicles: They are being recomputed.  So results are getting wiped out from the language updates and spam submits
 KiwiTae: Oo
 Wontonimo: yeah, i've tried the sponsored contest theonlyjt
 KiwiTae: theonlyjt me too :ghost: :cherries: :ghost:
 Wontonimo: what's this about "language updates" Westicles?
 Westicles: Groovy and dart broke for lots of people with the updates.  
 Wontonimo: are all the languages getting updated?  and what happens to bots in old multis?
 Westicles: They did a big update recently... before the last contest I think?
 Wontonimo: oh, i actually didn't notice :D

 Wontonimo: thanks&#160;!\
 Wontonimo: haha "Java&#160;: 1.8.0_211 (no update), too many performance issues above Java 8."
 eulerscheZahl: not like Java could be improved, it will ever be inferior to C#
 Wontonimo: I don't have a lot of interest in getting back in to Java.  Stepped away from it at work about 7 years ago.  I don't really miss it.
 Wontonimo: tbh, I loved it for a long time, then Oracle really changed it
 jacek: java changed when the fire nation attacked
 Wontonimo: then the Avatar was missing when the world needed him the most
 sprkrd: what's the problem with Java?

 BugKiller_328: Solving problem in 'Practice' will take effoect for my ranking or not&#160;?
 jacek: it will only give you exp, not ranking
 BugKiller_328: It means, Level and ranking don't have relation&#160;?
 jacek: no relation. i have relatively low level and high rank
 jacek: because i do mostly community games which give no exp but some CP
 BugKiller_328: Thanks I just followed you
 sprkrd: some achievements in multi will give you experience, but it's a one time thing
 KiwiTae: u get xp from passing leagues :p
 sprkrd: meaning that multis can contribute to your level, but puzzles not
 sprkrd: but puzzles wont contribute to your rank*
 BugKiller_328: @jacek, @KiwiTae, @sprkrd I'm following you guys but I'm not good enough as you&#160;:(
 KiwiTae: you gonna get better, tbh its like theres always better players than you
 KiwiTae: unless your #1
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 BugKiller_328: one more question
 BugKiller_328: if I get great profile here, it will be useful for me in getting job&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: If I make awesome progress here... like high level, high ranking..
 sprkrd: dunno, have never tried the "get a job" feature
 eulerscheZahl: the profile alone won't get you a job. it might help a bit. showing passion is always a good thing
 BugKiller_328: I mean.. I'll not try to get a job here too
 eulerscheZahl: anything can help, not just a CG profile. github, ...
 sprkrd: but i'd say don't get too obsessed with the rank/level and stuff
 BugKiller_328: but If I show my profile to someone else, it will give impression&#160;? :D
 struct: step 1 win a contest
 struct: Well it shows that you are interested in programming 
 jacek: could be nice bonus to CV, but some github with your own project would be better
 BugKiller_328: thanks for your suggestions...
 sprkrd: at any rate, i wouldn't put too many details in your CV about the rank and all that, you can just say that you're an active participant in CG, stackoverflow, top coder, or whatever. If you put too much info it'd look like you're artificially filling it up
 sprkrd: and yeah, projects in github and whatnot are higher priority
 BugKiller_328: got it..
 BugKiller_328: in few months ago, I was top 1% in stackoverflow, 
 darkhorse64: remember also that surgeons are never asked if they do surgery on their free time. If you want to invest yourself into CG, do it only if it brings fun to your life
 BugKiller_328: but I could keep it up because I can't watch stackoverflow to ansewr..
 BugKiller_328: yes, I'll remember your words. thanks again.

 jacek: coders strike back is somewhat tutorial/onboarding game
 jacek: almost as easy as onitama
 darkhorse64: Lower leagues are always easy (except Ocean Of Code), pick one, read the statement, try simple ideas, see if you are interested, if not, switch, if yes, try hard
 eulerscheZahl: you miss no opportunity to call Onitama easy jacek. Or to promote paper spccer
 KiwiTae: eulerscheZahl thats like me this month &gt;&lt; 11th day in bed with a cast 
 eulerscheZahl: what have you done?
 eulerscheZahl: sky diving without parachute?
 KiwiTae: reconstruction of the ankle i was missing too many ligaments
 eulerscheZahl: oh, something wrong from birth on?
 KiwiTae: nooo just from being clumsy 
 KiwiTae: they adviced me to stop running for a bit and get surgery or id loose the ankle with more injuries hehe
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like a strong advice
 eulerscheZahl: like "get vaccinated or risk serious damage due to covid"
 struct: maybe ill try onitama
 struct: your bot is a NN jacek?
 jacek: yes
 AllYourTrees: how do you train your NNs jacek?
 AllYourTrees: anyone implement a NNUE yet?
 jacek: with cpu?
 jacek: have you seen marchete's CGZero?
 AllYourTrees: nope
 struct: yes, but i havent read about it yet
 struct: I need to finish the book first
 jacek: i have my own training framework, when bots play against themselves and train from that
 AllYourTrees: ahhh okay
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/introduction</a>
 jacek: similar, but i use value only, not policy
 struct: isnt training usually done with GPU?
 jacek: if you have decent one...
 jacek: and/or complicated NN architecture, my NNs are rather small
 struct: ah yeah forgot about both of those things
 jacek: AllYourTrees what do you mean by NNUE? that chess thing has 40k inputs alone
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: thats nice that Marchete published that blog post
 AllYourTrees: i have my code open on github, wasn't sure if i should share it
 Wontonimo: Thanks for sharing the playground link jacek, and thanks Marchete for writing it&#160;!!!  Awesome stuff
 AllYourTrees: have any of you heard of open_spiel? they have a ton of algorithm implementations in c++ including AZ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/tree/master">https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/tree/master</a>, found it very helpful
 AllYourTrees: (its from deepmind)
 jacek: there is even 1 of my pull requests
 AllYourTrees: :O
 jacek: well maybe it wasnt pull request. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues/81">https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues/81</a>
 AllYourTrees: oh sweet
 AllYourTrees: wait did you write the solver part for the c++?
 AllYourTrees: i've been staring at that recently&#160;:)
 struct: the code of the article?
 AllYourTrees: the open_spiel mcts solver implementation jacek made an issue about
 jacek: no, i did only some readme
 jacek: others did implementation
 AllYourTrees: well can i ask you a question about mcts solver anyway? :D
 jacek: sure
 AllYourTrees: when you solve a node, do you have to remove the values backpropped from that node previously? like if the node had 500 visits and -0.5 value, but you solve it to be a win, then all the parents of that node should have the 500 visits changed to value of 1.0?
 struct: doesnt matter
 struct: you wont select solved nodes
 AllYourTrees: but doesn't it affect exploration earlier up the tree?
 jacek: in code, i always increase visits +1, and override win/lose if neccessary. i wont just solved nodes
 struct: ah I see what you mean
 jacek: in theory it may affect exploration a bit or overestimate node with many proven children loses, but i dont care and it seems to be working
 AllYourTrees: haha okay
 struct: I also dont take it into account
 AllYourTrees: while you guys are being so helpful, does it matter if you use reward / num_visits or num_visits for selecting what move to play in the game?
 struct: hmm i usually do reward/visits
 jacek: for NN i use score + log(visits)
 jacek: in pure mcts that would be reward/visits + log(visits)
 AllYourTrees: okay, geez there are so many different options is crazy haha
 sprkrd: i go by just visits, but then again, i don't use mcts-solver
 AllYourTrees: sounds like i just need to try a bunch :D
 sprkrd: (i've only discovered mcts-solver as of recently)
 AllYourTrees: same sprkrd
 struct: I applied it 20 days ago or so
 struct: on uttt
 sprkrd: i was thinking... wouldn't mcts with a temporal-difference update subsume mcts-solver?
 sprkrd: working backwards, backpropagating the maximum value at each node (rather than the result of the simulation), q-learning style
 AllYourTrees: hmm would the max value be either -1 or 1? or 0 i suppose for draws?
 sprkrd: oh, don't mind me, focus on your mcts-solver implementation. I shouldn't have added noise to the conversation :sweat_smile:
 jacek: hm?
 sprkrd: it's just that i've found this paper: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cig2017.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/paper_30.pdf">http://www.cig2017.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/paper_30.pdf</a>
 sprkrd: they've implemented SARSA-MCTS, and I was wondering why nobody has tried Q-learning-MCTS yet
 jacek: hm? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~plaata1/papers/cgw2018.pdf">https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~plaata1/papers/cgw2018.pdf</a>
 sprkrd: then I made the erroneous conjecture that Q-learning-MCTS should subsume MCTS-solver
 sprkrd: jacek oh, so they have tried
 jacek: quick&amp;dirty search on google
 sprkrd: when i search "mcts q-learning" i just find things about alphazero
 sprkrd: which doesn't use q-learning anyway
 Wontonimo: reinforcement learning is the same formulation as q-learning, just applied to a NN reward function instead of state
 sprkrd: that wording is weird, but as long as you're in peace with it :D
 Wontonimo: is English your second language?
 sprkrd: yeah, but i'm not talking about the language itself
 sprkrd: RL doesn't have to involve neural nets a priori
 Wontonimo: we were talking about alphazero
 Wontonimo: context my dude, context
 sprkrd: ah, no, yeah, i know conceptually how alphazero works
 sprkrd: before i was just talking about my crappy search skills
 jacek: crappy bfs or dfs search
 sprkrd: crappy gfs, i guess :joy:
 Arol90-MPSI-LIV: ohhh crappy gfs

 BugKiller_328: my solution works fine except one case.
 BugKiller_328: I don't know when I need to add space..
 BlaiseEbuth: Haven't done it. Have took a look to the forum thread?
 Westicles: which case do you fail?
 BugKiller_328: ""The concatenated labels within an orthant spell a word. Therefore, these words need to be spaced when crossing some axis, that is, when entering a new orthant.""
 BugKiller_328: I didn't understand this sentence.
 BugKiller_328: failed on 04 "Spacing"
 BugKiller_328: expected is "unalike words"
 BugKiller_328: my result is "unalikewords"
 Westicles: Just check if the sign changes on any of the coordinates
 BugKiller_328: :joy: didn't get understand for your explain too.
 BugKiller_328: maybe, I have problem in understanding..
 BugKiller_328: sign changes means like
 BugKiller_328: -5 to 5   4 to -4&#160;?
 Westicles: yes
 BugKiller_328: thanks for your explain. just followed you.
 BugKiller_328: will try to fix
 BugKiller_328: failed in "Quotes" now..
 BugKiller_328: Found: some"scarequote"usageExpected: some "scare quote" usage
 BugKiller_328: ah, I found an issue. 
 Westicles: If the last position is (x1,y1) and the new one is (x2,y2), add a space if x1*x2&lt;0 or y1*y2&lt;0
 BugKiller_328: just checked whether sign changed and also abs value is same
 Westicles: ok cool
 BugKiller_328: just need to check whether sign is changed. doesn't need to check whether its absolute values are same..&#160;:)
 BugKiller_328: thanks :Westicles
 Westicles: right
 leatherback: I'm having some issues with the AI race if anyone wants to help me out
 leatherback: I'm thinking the code is supposed to be Console.WriteLine(x =+ nextCheckpointX, y =+ nextCheckPointY, (0 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 100);  But it keeps giving me an error saying that the first portion cannot be turned into a string from an int, and i'm not sure where to declare the thrust
 BlaiseEbuth: =+&#160;?
 leatherback: I thought it worked both ways lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Na... ^^
 leatherback: So... any help with the AI thing?
 BlaiseEbuth: What are x and y? Existing variables?
 leatherback: Yeah, they are labeled as the x and y position of the pod racer. While nextCheckpointX &amp; Y are the next checkpoint that the pod needs to go to
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok. And adding the cp position to the pod's one give...? :thinking:
 leatherback: It gives me an error, CS1503 It says that i'm trying to convert "x += nextCheckpointX" from an int into a string 
 BlaiseEbuth: That's right. But my question was more "What do you expect ftom this calculation?" ^^'
 leatherback: oh, I expected it to head to the position. I figured that if the x and y position was added to the location of the checkpoint that the pod would head to that position
 leatherback: I'm sorry, i'm a bit new to coding.
 BlaiseEbuth: Your output goal is to say "target that position with this thrust" to your pod
 BlaiseEbuth: But what your pod position + the checkpoint one is supposed to be&#160;?
 leatherback: I am not sure It shows that i'm heading toward 3000, 3000, with a thrust of 50
 leatherback: I would assume that my position would be 0, 0.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not the case.
 BlaiseEbuth: Your pod will go to the x,y you give to it. So why not just targeting the next cp?
 leatherback: OH
 leatherback: So I was overthinking it wasn't I?
 BlaiseEbuth: Things gonna be harder. But for now... Yes ^^

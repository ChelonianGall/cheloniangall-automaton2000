 MrZee: Time to take a break from Mad Pod because math is hurting my head lol
 Uljahn: there is math in MPR?
 YS_Yousef: yea
 YS_Yousef: there is a lot of math in MPR
 MrZee: Especially when you're attempting to reverse engineer the boss lol
 YS_Yousef: XD
 Darleanow: hello guys, in game pod, why do i don't earn elo when winning in arena&#160;?
 Darleanow: i actually won the bos, and didn't lost a single multiplayer match but i won't gain any division
 5DN1L: you need to enter the bot in arena
 Darleanow: wdym&#160;?
 Darleanow: just clicking on test in arena&#160;?
 5DN1L: yes
 Darleanow: bc i did that already
 Darleanow: won the match
 5DN1L: then wait for all the battles to finish
 Darleanow: allright&#160;!! 
 Darleanow: i did like 10 already x)
 5DN1L: But you aren't above the boss in that league
 Darleanow: yes&#160;! i'm ranked 2145, but i won against the boss already&#160;! in the launch code pannel
 5DN1L: click Leaderboard
 Darleanow: you mean detailed leaderboard&#160;?
 5DN1L: no
 5DN1L: the one on the coding page
 5DN1L: on left hand side
 Darleanow: okay i saw it
 MrZee: When you submit it, it shows a percentage of battles completed and once that finishes it'll update your rank. It takes a few minutes for it all to complete
 5DN1L: You can see the boss at the top
 Darleanow: yeah i see it
 5DN1L: but you're way down below the boss
 Darleanow: with a score 
 Darleanow: i don't see any percentage MrZee, i'm probably blind x)
 5DN1L: he's talking about a different thing
 Darleanow: I struggled way too much on this one
 Darleanow:         if (next_checkpoint_dist&lt;1500){
 Darleanow: (C)
 Darleanow: bc setting thurst to 0 was making me loosing against boss
 5DN1L: you're given a hint on how to pass Wood League 2
 5DN1L: in the statement there's a pseudocode
 5DN1L: you just have to follow that
 5DN1L: no need to implement anything else at the moment
 Darleanow: wdym by pseudo code
 5DN1L: read the statement
 Darleanow: i don't understand this sentence
 Darleanow: yes, it gave me an algorithm that i used in my code
 Darleanow: and made one with checkpoint dist
 5DN1L: just use that and it should be good enough. if you've done more probably you've done it the wrong way
 5DN1L: let's check your code
 5DN1L: paste it here
 Darleanow: this is what i added&#160;:

 Darleanow: here's the whole thing
 5DN1L: remove your own if-else
 Darleanow: checkpoint angle and checkpoint dist&#160;?
 Darleanow: this is the two things i added here
 5DN1L: i mean the second if-block
 5DN1L: the first if-block is fine
 Darleanow: okay
 Darleanow: i start my code
 5DN1L: try testing it
 Darleanow: i lost ranking, but won
 Darleanow: i'ù going into arena
 5DN1L: yup, enter it
 Darleanow: but it told me about checkpoint dist, so i thought i had to use it x)
 Darleanow: im ranked 
 5DN1L: it has given you more info than needed for now
 5DN1L: you'll definitely need more info as you move up
 Darleanow: oh okay i see&#160;!!
 Darleanow: i went wood  let's go 
 5DN1L: and your rank won't be affected in any way as long as you don't enter the bot in the arena
 Darleanow: thanks for uour help mate&#160;:)
 5DN1L: no probs
 ImKingKong: how to do death first search
 maoru: depth first search might be difficult to be used for this problem
 ImKingKong: ok then how to do mime type?
 ImKingKong: bc i only need 2 xp

 5DN1L:&#160;???
 ImKingKong: mime type
 ImKingKong: not mad pod
 5DN1L: anyway nobody should paste a full code solution for you
 ImKingKong: ok
 ImKingKong: ik that
 MrZee: You'll want to read up on the wiki for that or take some pathfinding courses because the question on how to do any type of pathfinding search depends on the problem specifically. Best anyone can do is give you a basic explanation of what a depth first search is\
 ImKingKong: ohok
 Darleanow: Hello again, why is the boost value equal to -1716305898 when i set up the thurst value to boost&#160;??
 5DN1L: where do you see that number
 derjack: sounds like uninitialized variable
 Darleanow: in the debug console, it says :invalid input. Expected 'x y power' but found '5515 7486 -1716305898'.  i set power to boost when next_checkpoint_distance &gt;9000
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/085a3d68-fe08-4cc1-8cf7-75e492a4771c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/085a3d68-fe08-4cc1-8cf7-75e492a4771c</a>
 Darleanow: im not changing the value of printf either the value of scanf 
 Darleanow: should i&#160;?
 5DN1L: whole code please?
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6b82f6cb-f061-46b1-851b-8021fd79262d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6b82f6cb-f061-46b1-851b-8021fd79262d</a>
 Darleanow: here you go
 derjack: its string and number? wtf
 5DN1L: yeah that's the issue
 Darleanow: should i convert boost as %d
 derjack: sounds "BOOST" is some address and assigned to thrust
 ImKingKong: how to search a player?
 MrZee: It should be a string and it needs a space before the word "boost"
 derjack: you should do if (&gt;9000) { print x y 100} else { print x y boost }
 5DN1L: or the other way round if he wants
 5DN1L: but definitely not %d paired with "BOOST"
 Darleanow: but if i do like this, it will try to boost all the times dist&lt;9000
 derjack: what i mean is dont put "BOOST" into variable, just print it directly
 5DN1L: Darleanow i think you may move your printf inside the second if-block
 5DN1L: and as derjack suggests, print it directly if it is BOOST
 5DN1L: or use %s i think
 MrZee: Otherwise your thrust will need to be a string to hold the word boost
 Darleanow: oh okay&#160;!!
 Darleanow: i will try it 
 5DN1L: %s may not work i guess, i dunno
 5DN1L: same variable cannot be string at one time and integer at another time
 5DN1L: i'm not that familiar with C
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8278b74-d082-4715-a2af-5c626554131c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8278b74-d082-4715-a2af-5c626554131c</a>
 Darleanow: i did it like so
 5DN1L: yup, looks like it should work?
 Darleanow: it wont i guess, because i'm allowed to do it once a race
 5DN1L: ah that
 5DN1L: but you can still try to run it without entering into arena first
 Thorcode: the second will be the max thrust
 5DN1L: just for testing
 5DN1L: yeah that, Thorcode
 Darleanow: okay i have an idea, setting a to 1, if i print boost, i cant do it again as a set up to 0
 Darleanow: with || operator
 derjack: :tada:
 5DN1L: yes you can keep track of it like that
 Thorcode: or you could just let it run as fast as i can and make it drift
 Thorcode: it i mean
 5DN1L: you can :upside_down:

 OceansCurse: im very used to FVector2D from UE4 is there anything similar I can use in here for C++&#160;? 
 MrZee: Or as slow as it can go, be like the tortoise and the hare
 5DN1L: Darleanow move a=1 outside while loop
 5DN1L: then change a to 0 after boosting
 5DN1L: otherwise a will forever be 1
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f090964e-02b3-4ff1-a64e-b4ff995d2018">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f090964e-02b3-4ff1-a64e-b4ff995d2018</a>
 derjack: OceansCurse no
 OceansCurse: pepeHands
 OceansCurse: Thanks tho
 derjack: oO
 5DN1L: the code looks ok? Darleanow
 5DN1L: you can test it
 Darleanow: it doesn't boosts 
 5DN1L: oops
 5DN1L: not angle
 5DN1L: distance
 5DN1L: distance&lt;9000
 Darleanow: oh maybe should i try 
 5DN1L: you typed the wrong variable name
 Darleanow: if a=1 boost else do what you're supposed to do
 5DN1L: well my strategy was simply using boost in first turn and ignore distance altogether
 Darleanow: yeah but if i boost when theres a small distance, with the thurst i will lose time, bc i will go way too far
 Darleanow: so i guess that i need to do it if theres a certain distance
 5DN1L: in terms of passing Wood League 1 my strategy is enough
 5DN1L: but for higher leagues you definitely need more than that
 Darleanow: okay&#160;!!
 derjack: btw. is a == 1
 5DN1L: ah that, yup
 derjack: eeyup even
 5DN1L: should be a==1 instead of a=1 in if
 5DN1L: yip yep yup
 Darleanow: okay just did it

 Darleanow: still not working with &amp;&amp; x)

 Darleanow: ""/tmp/Answer.c: In function ‘main’:/tmp/Answer.c:46:1: error: expected declaration or statement at end of input
 5DN1L: you have used a lot of brackets o_O
 derjack: use proper indentation
 Darleanow: i can't figure out where it is
 5DN1L: "it"?
 Darleanow: the problem x)
 Darleanow: i mean okay for indeniation, but i can figure where is there a mistake

 5DN1L: before a=0
 Darleanow: still isn't working
 5DN1L: what is the error now
 5DN1L: what does console say
 Darleanow: ""Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... Darleanow will no longer be active in this game.""
 Darleanow: expecting } at the end
 5DN1L: oh there should be two } at the end
 Darleanow: so it's the same problem with indenation
 5DN1L: not just one
 5DN1L: you miss one } for while loop
 Darleanow: yes, its not giving me a red wave now, but it still isn't working lmao
 5DN1L: console says...?
 Darleanow: ""Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... Darleanow will no longer be active in this game.""
 5DN1L: this is useless
 5DN1L: lol
 5DN1L: anything else?
 Darleanow: nope&#160;:/
 5DN1L: whole code again?
 Darleanow: oh okay i understand a bit, now i boost, but it explodes after x)

 Thorcode: well nothing
 5DN1L: remove  &amp;&amp; next_checkpoint_dist&gt;8000
 5DN1L: and try again?
 Thorcode: what league are you in darleanow?
 Darleanow: wood 1 xd
 Darleanow: okay ill do this
 Darleanow: i still explode x)
 Uljahn: "}}" in the end might be wrong, while loop shouldn't include "return 0"  i guess
 5DN1L: ah that
 5DN1L: right
 Darleanow: it was by default
 5DN1L: } return 0 }
 5DN1L: } return 0; }
 Darleanow: OHH OKAY
 Darleanow: i boosted&#160;!!
 Uljahn: :tada:
 Darleanow: theres a little fix i need to do
 Darleanow: i will boost when next_checkpoint_angle is 90, so i'm in a straight line
 Uljahn: what? that's wrong
 Darleanow: indeed lmao
 5DN1L: try not fixing and just submitting it to areana :wink:
 Darleanow: its disturbing ahahah
 Darleanow: im in arena :p
 Darleanow: sorry guys to ask for this much, i'm really new to coding
 5DN1L: after this league you may want to take a break first
 5DN1L: practise some puzzles instead
 Darleanow: in clash code&#160;??
 Uljahn: you need to learn basics to suffer less :smirk:
 5DN1L: clash or just puzzles
 Darleanow: okay sir&#160;!
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 Darleanow: Thanks&#160;!!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Darleanow: I'm smoking them all ahahah
 Darleanow: whats your division&#160;?
 5DN1L: And every time you get promoted, your bot is automatically entered into the arena
 5DN1L: so you can wait until that has finished and your rank is really stabilised
 5DN1L: i mean the arena of the upper league
 Darleanow: LET'S GO NEW LEAGUE
 Darleanow: oh okay i see&#160;!
 5DN1L: so now your bot is in the arena of the Bronze League
 Darleanow: yes&#160;!
 5DN1L: let's see how that goes
 5DN1L: don't change your code just yet
 Darleanow: i didn't&#160;!
 Darleanow: i unlocked collision
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Darleanow: some are smoking me up&#160;:'(
 5DN1L: so you should wait until all the battles are over, watch some replays of them to get an idea of what your weaknesses are
 Darleanow: they collide me so hard
 Darleanow: bc im doing a smooth deceleration
 Darleanow: like im not braking like an animal, to keep thurst at its best
 MrZee: bool winRace = true;Therefore I win =P
 Darleanow: ahahhah
 5DN1L: your score keeps rising for the moment
 5DN1L: better read the statement now to understand what's new in this league
 Darleanow: yes, they added collisions, 
 Darleanow: wich depend on thurst
 Nulled: collisions??? no shot
 Darleanow: im first wtf
 5DN1L: yeah these leagues...
 Darleanow: x)
 5DN1L: that's why i told you not to change anything
 5DN1L: Mad Pod is like that
 Darleanow: but i changed something :p
 5DN1L: a tutorial until you get to gold
 Nulled: :100:
 Darleanow: as the randomization makes it possible to have distance under 8000
 Darleanow: so i removed so i boost at the start
 5DN1L: i did notice that you resubmitted the code :smirk:
 Darleanow: ohoh
 5DN1L: i was wondering why the war progress dropped to zero again lol
 Darleanow: ahahaha
 5DN1L: oh and you resubmitted again?
 Darleanow: i dropped to 19k wtf
 Darleanow: i didnt touched the code&#160;:'(
 5DN1L: you always start from the bottom
 5DN1L: if you resubmit your code
 Darleanow: BUT I DIDNT
 Darleanow: AND AGAIN
 Darleanow: oh okay someone rdc me so he's changing my code to annoy me
 5DN1L: :confused:
 Darleanow: ok im 8900k
 Darleanow: maybe i will gain a division :0
 Darleanow: 53%
 Darleanow: its so slooooow
 Uljahn: use your time wisely: watch last battles and think on how to fix your lost matches
 Darleanow: actually i'm not loosing x)
 mr-joelM: hi, i jump on the conversation as ive been stuck since i got to bronze league as well...how do you deal with the collision?as well im not using the boost properly since the idea would be to learn the first round i suppose and use the boost in the longest section but i cant see how to do that... any input
 Darleanow: You need to boost at the start, it made me able winning so much more races
 Darleanow: collisions depend on your thrust, the one who has the more thurst will send away further the other one depending on the thurst
 mr-joelM: well i win a lots of them without even boosting but i believe the next league lay in the path of learning the circuit and using the boost at the best opportunity hence the longest stretch
 Uljahn: learning the map might be useful, because it gives you possibility to start turning towards the next checkpoint earlier (before you actually reach your current one)
 mr-joelM: my pods slow down depending on distance and angle positioning on the next checkpoint, thats the only thing i did from the minute i started and strait away went to bronze league but now im stuck there.
 Uljahn: also you can ignore collisions until gold or even legend
 MrZee: One option you can do is use the first lap to build a list of checkpoint coordinates and use that to target the next checkpoint before you even reach the current checkpoint
 mr-joelM: it says: From Wood to Silver League: A tutorial containing several missions for newcomers....but i havent actually see any tutorial at all&#160;!?!?!
 MrZee: The entirety of the leagues are tutorials for gold/legend
 Uljahn: ask for a refund :smiley:
 MrZee: That's why they slowly introduce new mechanics in each league, it's all in prep for the gold league
 mr-joelM: hahahaha
 mr-joelM: i cant i've already scratch the paint of the pod!

 Darleanow: im 36k, i gon break my screen ToT
 Darleanow: why do i have to do it since the start
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 5DN1L: there's a longer break for higher league promotions
 Darleanow: oh okay&#160;:'(
 5DN1L: there's usually a timer telling you how much time you have to wait
 Darleanow: i don't have any timer&#160;:'(
 5DN1L: but if you really can't see any timer, then you may ask [CG]Thibaud to check for you
 Darleanow: how can i msg him&#160;?
 5DN1L: type "/msg" then his name
 5DN1L: with a space in between i mean
 5DN1L: but you're running battles again right now?
 Darleanow: yeah i do&#160;!!
 Darleanow: i'm havinng battles atm
 5DN1L: then wait and see if this time works before you PM him
 Darleanow: i don't see any
 Darleanow: even before i was 1st ranked
 5DN1L: the battles are running
 5DN1L: wait
 5DN1L: be patient
 Darleanow: sorry&#160;!
 5DN1L: check the battle progress by clicking LAST BATTLES
 5DN1L: you can also see the circle progress in LEADERBOARD
 Uljahn: it says 30% atm
 Darleanow: oh yeah mb mb
 Uljahn: ok, what now?
 Darleanow: i went from 4 to 566 x)
 Uljahn: are you above the boss in the leaderboard?
 Darleanow: i was
 Darleanow: but then boom went down
 Uljahn: unlucky
 5DN1L: Never resubmit the code when you're good 😈
 Darleanow: yup&#160;:'(
 Darleanow: i didn't&#160;!!!!
 Darleanow: it was like someone didnt wanted me to get out of bronze 
 5DN1L: Must be someone whose name starts with "D" :thinking:
 Darleanow: lmaoo 
 Darleanow: i didn't touched the code, i swear
 5DN1L: but you know there's randomness in the battles
 Uljahn: maybe your code is not good enough for silver :smirk:
 Darleanow:&#160;:'((((
 Darleanow: it is&#160;!!  
 Darleanow: the ia rated me 17.09
 Darleanow: even though i was at 17.3 
 Thorcode: just learn to use drift
 Thorcode: that gonna change the whole mad game
 5DN1L: next time if you're stuck on the top without promotion, just PM Thibaud and don't attempt anything else
 Darleanow: what is even drift&#160;? u mean with thurst&#160;? and decelration
 Darleanow: okay sir&#160;!!
 StraumliPerversion: Darleanow, they talk about this same game thousands of times over and over on the chat, you can spend weeks reading the logs and get really good at it
 Darleanow: where can i find those logs&#160;?

 5DN1L: there are also some resources on Mad Pod's front page, and in the forum
 Darleanow: thank you all for your help&#160;!!
 Darleanow: i will try to make a better code for when you have to decelerate, and turn

 ionKOT: k = [ i  for i in range(1,n) if i&#160;% 7 == 0 ] how to add a counter to this list range&#160;? 
 ionKOT: python
 Alshock: you want to count the list size&#160;? then len(k), you want to do so on the fly? sum(1 for i in ...) you want to count something else?
 ionKOT: i want to count how many times if true 
 ninjadip: hello
 ionKOT: but how do i do it in that form
 Alshock: note that in your case, range(7, n, 7) does the same as your comprehension
 Alshock: what do you mean in that form? You are making a list, list is not a "count" value of itself, you can though count the number of elements with len(list)
 ionKOT: wait im so dumb lol i can just use len()
 Alshock: if you don't want a list, but still want to iterate, then generators are there for you
 Alshock: if you need to go fast on large sequences, you probably want to stop iterating, and use maths
 ionKOT: can you show a snip?
 Alshock: the number of multiples of 7 in range 1 to n inclusive is the floor value of n / 7
 Alshock: in python k = n // 7
 ionKOT: i see now&#160;! lol thanks for the tip

 <b>**KyreX slaps krallendor around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/68697723244639" /> Sarstan: Arrays are just wrecking me. I really need to learn how to read values and apply them from an array.
 struct: what problems are you having with them?
 Sarstan: No idea how to actually use them. The syntax. I'm doing C#.
 struct: ill be back in 5min I can help you when Im back if you want
 Sarstan: As an example, I'm looking at Broomstick Flyers. Need to pull from the array created who entities are the balls. 
 jacek: you have the string entityType no?
 Sarstan: That's right.
 jacek: whats has to do with arrays?
 struct: They are not giving you any array
 struct: you can create an array if you want though
 jacek: well the default code split string into arrays
 Sarstan: Isn't that all in an array? My thought process is have it find all the entities that are "snaffles," then throw those into finding the closest to each entity that's my wizards, and have them each go to it. But isn't each entity assigned a given ID?
 struct: inputs is an array yes
 struct: but then it gives you each position of the array
 struct: position 0 is entityId, 1 entityType
 struct: and so on
 struct: If you want to store the snaffles in an array I would create it like this
 Sarstan: I guess I'm confused on how to pick an entity.
 struct: Snaffle[] snaffles = new Snaffle[entities - 6];
 struct: you check the entityType
 struct: if (entityType == "SNAFFLE")
 struct: you add it to your snaffles array
 Sarstan: Oh!
 Sarstan: Sounds like I'm overthinking it.
 Sarstan: There's another issue I'm running into. If I try to call entityType outside of the for command it's generated inside, I get errors. Any way to pull that out of the for loop?
 Scarfield: sounds like you could use a good tutorial tbh, these puzzles and multiplayers are much easier and more fun, when you have a better understanding of the basics 
 Sarstan: True. Any suggestions there?
 Scarfield: im not a c# coder, but will look in a minute&#160;:)
 Sarstan: I've seen multiple puzzles that I keep bumping into this from.
 Scarfield: just to answer your question, you need to create the array to store the data outside of/before the for-loop, or else the array will be deleted when exiting the loop, and you cant acces the data after
 Sarstan: I noticed it's perfectly happy printing them off with a Console.Error.WriteLine command and it will update when any of the entities disappears.
 Sarstan: While it's in the for loop.
 struct: yes
 struct: you are given every updated game state
 Sarstan: I wish I could find like a checklist for learning programming. Tutorials seem to just drop you and not guide you to what's next.
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVfQkRYPMAU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVfQkRYPMAU</a> Sarstan this is a short video explaining what i think you are missing right now&#160;:)
 Sarstan: I get the breakdown of class and method. Just inside a method how to grab info from a loop and use it elsewhere in the same method. 
 Sarstan: Like I have:for (some code) { more code and entityId } if (entityId = more code) { more code }I get an error in the if statement. Can't get entityId.
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2FNKhPYb8Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2FNKhPYb8Y</a> the point was about the "scope" the first 4-5 minutes has your answer, if im understanding your problem correctly at least
 Scarfield: you can share your code, and maybe i can help
 Sarstan: Yeah, that second video explains my issue. I'll need to declare my variables in the method outside a loop.

 Scarfield: they are explaining it know on stream
 Ninjatron: yeah i don't care about it
 Scarfield: dont ask then..
 Ninjatron: what was the question about? graphs? strings?
 Ninjatron: idc about the stream lol
 Scarfield: how did you/your teams do DomiKo and linjoehan
 DomiKo: my team have 3.65Mln
 linjoehan: my team read the problem and then quit
 Ninjatron: isn't it obvious
 Ninjatron: :D
 Ninjatron: hahahaha damn I hate those novella sized problem definitions
 DomiKo: top29 here :D
 Scarfield: lol linjoehan xD noice DomiKo :muscle:
 linjoehan: 1.7Mil
 Ninjatron: linjoe now i got even more curious
 DomiKo: so I guess finally finals for us :D
 Ninjatron: what was the question that made them quit without trying?
 Scarfield: i looked at the previous hash code, and figured it was too hard for me to bother, but i will probably try code jam&#160;:)
 linjoehan: It's not exactly easy I guess
 Ninjatron: is it like a dream for you all to join Google or something?
 Scarfield: they didnt say how many teams qualify for next round of hash code?
 linjoehan: I just about managed to set everything up and get a solution to work, but I had no time to optimize anything, just random fill a solution and prey
 linjoehan: I don't know maybe one day when I'm good enough I can join Google
 linjoehan: I got into Amazon for a short while, but then they kicked me out again
 Ninjatron: lol you think all engineers at Google are so good?
 linjoehan: Why do you think I think that?
 Ninjatron: you say "when i am good enough"
 DomiKo: Ninjatron  you dont thing that?
 Scarfield: feed the ducks not the trolls
 Ninjatron: no i don't
 linjoehan: that's about me not the google engineers
 Ninjatron: if you can get into amazon you can get into google
 Ninjatron: i almost passed their interview with just 1 month prep, and failed because i listened recruiters idea of doing an AOE interview using C++ lol
 DomiKo: Ninjatron amazon is only popular in USA xd
 linjoehan: Na Amazon was easy to get into. And if they gave me a fitting role I might have managed to stick around a bit, but I gon interviewed in the stuff I like (Algorithms) and the work was a bunch of front end stuff that I've never even tried to play with before
 Ninjatron: actually Amazon is hated by many of their employers lol
 dbf: DomiKo, congrats!
 Ninjatron: I think Amazon is really struggling finding talent
 DomiKo: thx &lt;3
 linjoehan: Amazon is hated but I don't think so much on the software side of things. I may be wrong though.
 Ninjatron: they have a bad rep already
 Ninjatron: nah, they have PIP, will overwork people, terrible managers and bunch of other crap
 Ninjatron: if you have a linkedin profile, and looking halfway decent their recruiters will reach you, at least in the US
 linjoehan: haha pip is a blessing. I was so out of there when that thing came around, so I took the free money and ran
 Ninjatron: i can't say I understand your issue though linjoe
 linjoehan: what do you mean?
 Ninjatron: didn't they put you on FE team after you requested it?
 Ninjatron: also, no matter what role it is, you are going to come across things you don't know
 linjoehan: No, I was in a tooling team and the big project the got stuck with was all front end. before that project it was all going quite smoothly.
 Ninjatron: i see, didn't they give enough time? were you the only responsible engineer?
 linjoehan: Naa there was no chance of me being able to meet their bar for that project. They asked me to translate ruby on rails to react. And I'm like wait a second, can you tell me more about html?
 Ninjatron: ah... can't comment on that, never worked with rails i thought rails is backend 
 Ninjatron: does it have a template engine or something?
 linjoehan: yeah something like that.
 linjoehan: I must say it was a rather depressing time trying to fight through the stuff I barely know anything about
 Ninjatron: yeah that can happen, it is my understanding Amazon is managed ruthlessly
 linjoehan: I guess that's why it was easy to get in.
 Ninjatron: it doesn't matter really
 linjoehan: my interview question was 2 sum, like who goes to a technical interview and can't 2sum? 
 Ninjatron: :D
 Ninjatron: that's odd
 Ninjatron: you didn't get an online challenge?
 Ninjatron: well I guess it is SDE1, and you're out of college
 linjoehan: Oh I did solve a difficult challenge problem before the interview. maybe it was that, but I thought they don't count the stuff before the interview or that's what they say at least I think.
 Ninjatron: yeah they don't count online challenge
 linjoehan: No I was put in SDE2 and I'm self taught.
 linjoehan: lol I actually asked my manager? Um SDE2 that don't seem right man.
 linjoehan: Oh well
 Ninjatron: lol
 Ninjatron: what was the system design question?
 linjoehan: I don't remember something about reserving EC2 instances.
 Ninjatron: did you get asked object oriented design question?
 Ninjatron: it sounds like you were interviewed for SDEI
 Ninjatron: then they put you to an upper level and expected you to perform at that level
 Ninjatron: well anyway, doesn't matter, honestly there are tons of interesting companies where you will do more meaningful work anyway
 Magmi: Guys, how is the "Score" in leaderboard calculated for clash of code?
 Ninjatron: Jacek: "Using math"
 Ninjatron: just scroll over the question marks and they explain
 Addikins:  Lol prepping for an Amazon OA right now. Hoping for a 1x30 interview afterwards, otherwise I'm probably not gonna get in if it's anything more thorough
 Ninjatron: what is 1x30?
 Addikins: 1 30 minute interview after the online assessment. It's common for SDE 1 (maybe 2?) roles
 Ninjatron: if you do well in challenge you will go directly to the final
 Addikins: Usually it is just going over your OA solution and possibly some culture fit checks, then an offer.
 Ninjatron: no final interview?
 Addikins: Seems like it highly depends on a combo of how well you did the OA and luck. A lot of people get a 1x30, others get a few more culture fit/technical rounds
 Ninjatron: and what do I get?
 Addikins: Interns usually get a 1x45 technical regardless
 Ninjatron: design snapchat, do the object oriented design for a card game, 2 algo questions and 2 hours behavioral
 Addikins: You get free doughnuts on Tuesdays between 9 and 10 am but only the white powdery kind that get everywhere
 Addikins: Did you interview/are an employee?
 Addikins: That sounds intense, though kinda fun if not for the pressure
 Ninjatron: I did, i was asked to design snapchat after manager wasted half 2/3 of the time ranting about their leadership principles and my experience
 Ninjatron: FUN? lol it was anything but 4 I didn't even have time to pee between the interview for 4 hours straight
 Ninjatron: then in each and every interview they wasted half or more time ranting about their LPs and behavioral
 Ninjatron: I thought everyone had to go through this?
 Addikins: Just like the work culture it seems super team/individual dependent&#160;:\
 Addikins: I'm just hoping to luck out at this point. Funny enough, I already had the stuff for my OA that I got yesterday but literally as we've been chatting I got an additional OA that is fairly different 🤔
 Ninjatron: yeah it was by far the worst interview for me, wasting half to 2/3 of time talking and then expecting me to design snapchat or solve medium difficulty questions wasn't fair at all
 Ninjatron: at the same time everyone says "Amazon is easy to get in" so I think I am the only one they decided to screw with lol
 Addikins: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d971dcf5-45b6-466f-8967-3dfc853efc62">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d971dcf5-45b6-466f-8967-3dfc853efc62</a>
 Addikins: Woah wasn't expecting it to create a link lol
 Ninjatron: yeah I got the same, I scored almost perfect or perfect not sure
 Addikins: Auto-email says 2.5 hours for: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/02172649-9ef3-4acf-ad33-6f7d020d7cae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/02172649-9ef3-4acf-ad33-6f7d020d7cae</a>
 Ninjatron: so was moved to final
 Ninjatron: that includes surveys afterwards
 Addikins: To respond to what you said, I think yeah you kinda got screwed but it also highly depends. Many interns/new grads go through that and it's the norm, where some professionals just get a 1x30. Are you a new grad?
 Ninjatron: i am but with some work experience
 Addikins: Did your invite email look like the second response I got?
 Ninjatron: seems like you will get easier questions
 Addikins: A lot of people say they do OA1, OA2, and OA3 as if they're separate, but for me it's being presented as one batch
 Ninjatron: you're a new grad with no experience I guess
 Addikins: Nope
 Ninjatron: so you have less time, but probably 1 easy 1 medium
 Addikins: Professional with ~2+ years experience and *ahem* an associates degree
 Ninjatron: I only had 1 OA, which was two medium difficulty questions one close to hard unless you knew UnionFind
 Addikins: Wasn't recorded though by the sounds of it?
 Ninjatron: it is not recorded but what difference does that make?
 Addikins: Just meaning it was on your own schedule, you didn't have to live code with someone watching you
 Ninjatron: no it is on your own schedule but you can't stop and continue later
 Addikins: Right, same for this one it seems, but others have had the OA separated which is interesting. They really are all over the place with them
 Addikins: What problems did you encounter btw?
 Ninjatron: I don't remember one was related to finding connected components in a graph
 Ninjatron: i mean that was the idea, cannot remember details it was a while ago

 StraumliPerversion: :taco: UZUHAMA
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry StraumliPerversion but you are too new.  Get someone to give you tacos first
 UZUHAMA:&#160;????
 UZUHAMA: What is that
 struct: still bugged I guess
 ASM_MOV_INT: @johncina you can submit contests for practice in the practice area, i have never done it, but .... cool!
 struct: :taco: UZUHAMA
 antiwonto: [auto] struct has awarded UZUHAMA 10 tacos. UZUHAMA now has 1 taco. struct now has 96 taco [sleeping]
 StraumliPerversion: some thing to scroll the chat if you say something embarassing
 UZUHAMA: ooh
 JohnCina: ok
 UZUHAMA: :taco:
 UZUHAMA: :taco: @StraumliPerversion
 UZUHAMA: um
 struct: no @
 UZUHAMA: :taco: StraumliPerversion
 StraumliPerversion: it is asleep now
 struct: the bot is sleeping now
 StraumliPerversion: but thanks
 UZUHAMA: oh
 UZUHAMA: ye
 ASM_MOV_INT: :taco: 
 UZUHAMA: :taco:
 StraumliPerversion: has Blaise resurfaced?
 StraumliPerversion: not the same without his shenanigans
 struct: Dont think so
 struct: at least not on world
 UZUHAMA: Does nested for-loop based on length of an array always have time complexity of O(n^2)?
 StraumliPerversion: for i=1:n;break;for j=1:n
 UZUHAMA: um excuse me
 UZUHAMA: I don't quite understand...
 StraumliPerversion: beats me, struct knows that CS stuff
 UZUHAMA: CS?
 StraumliPerversion: computer science
 UZUHAMA: oh
 UZUHAMA: where is struct&#160;:(
 struct: yes
 UZUHAMA: oh
 UZUHAMA: Does nested for-loop based on length of an array always have time complexity of O(n^2)?
 StraumliPerversion: even if you break out of the first loop?
 UZUHAMA: There's no break
 struct: well if he doesnt its always O(n^2)
 UZUHAMA: in the first loop
 UZUHAMA: oh no...
 UZUHAMA: :cry:
 UZUHAMA: This is why I have optimization
 UZUHAMA: So much harder than the problem itself
 UZUHAMA: *hate
 struct: I dont think thats optimization
 struct: thats only the solution
 StraumliPerversion: bender ep4?
 StraumliPerversion: oops, blunder ep3
 UZUHAMA: Well yeah
 UZUHAMA: It's not optimized yet
 UZUHAMA: So I gotta optimize it now, but...
 UZUHAMA: :c
 JohnCina: i'd done 3 reverse code in clash of code but the quest is not updated yet  
 JohnCina: the games of riddles
 StraumliPerversion: you have to approve this one first
 StraumliPerversion: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7639313ebafabcf1a746466819cd5a359dad">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7639313ebafabcf1a746466819cd5a359dad</a>
 struct: I saw this before I thikn
 struct: was it rejected?
 StraumliPerversion: yeah, it got deleted for sucking
 JohnCina: not on the contribution
 JohnCina: nvm
 JohnCina: already refreshed
 StraumliPerversion: but it was approved first
 StraumliPerversion: hey, thanks JohnCina.  I owe you some tacos when I get back on my feet
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: im eating lunch
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: xd
 UZUHAMA: Is there a way of knowing how much my code is optimized?Or, is there a way of getting the total runtime of the code or executed data?
 struct: you can measure the time
 struct: Before the function and after
 UZUHAMA: Time is always same
 UZUHAMA: Because I always get a time-out error
 struct: test it localy
 struct: or print the time every N iterations
 UZUHAMA: Oh that's smart!
 UZUHAMA: Thx
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: why my score in the clash of code suddenly got minus
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: i dont do anything
 ayaan-dev: hi
 DanteAntonioRemedioBradshaw: I'm new at coding and working on learning python.. This shet is HARD.... any tips?
 Wontonimo: yeah.  practice
 Wontonimo: practice the easy stuffa lot
 Wontonimo: check out this site for easier practice questions <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 Wontonimo: codingame is for people who already are comfortable with arrays, functions, and some basic algorithms
 Wontonimo: don't go away, just don't lean on this site until you have those basics down

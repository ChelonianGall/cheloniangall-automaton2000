 Uljahn: ZXC01: you can collect coordinates of checkpoints during the first lap and use them to your advantage, also you can calculate your velocity vector for the same reason
 ZXC01: ok thanks

 Jerrasterix: Hello Automaton2000, how are you doing&#160;??
 Automaton2000: how to write the code on github
 Jerrasterix: use vscode.dev Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it was nice chatting with you
 Jerrasterix: What do you mean you are leaving, I am lonely here Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: to be in the same time
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: what a time to be in the same timeline
 Automaton2000: yeah but if i need to fix my csb

 ZXC01: i mean there was a new about alpha zero long time ago
 ZXC01: news*
 Uljahn: clearly you can't read
 ZXC01: i now it says 17 nov
 Uljahn: it's about explainability which is a huge problem in DL
 ZXC01: ok fine..
 ZXC01: but i thought there are already alpha2???
 Westicles: give me xp and I will return the moon
 ZXC01: xp
 ZXC01: Westicles+=xp

 ZXC01: lolll
 Codeab: okey maybe dont do that that'll crash codinGame
 Codeab: question for all: can u add infinite xp in a while true loop?&#160;:)

 RandomAustralian: COME OONNNNN
 RandomAustralian: IM 7 AWAY
 FiniganEaldwine: I thinks it's pretty silly that Sortest Mode is not restricted to single language.
 RandomAustralian: 5...
 Stilgart: FiniganEaldwine: the score (in CP) is per language
 RandomAustralian: ONE CHARACTER
 RandomAustralian: JUST ONE MORE CHARACTER
 RandomAustralian: AHHHH
 RandomAustralian: Im gonna be mad
 RandomAustralian: 3 minutes to get rid of one character
 RandomAustralian: but idk if i can remove one or not&#160;;-;

 RandomAustralian: yeah
 RandomAustralian: im gonna be mad
 RandomAustralian: trying to beat a python person

 RandomAustralian: what can i improve
 Stilgart: sounds like a sed to me
 Stilgart: just bash it
 RandomAustralian: 1 MINUTE
 RandomAustralian: AHHHHHH
 RandomAustralian: IDK IF I CAN IMPROVE IT
 RandomAustralian: IM GONNA NOT WIN IT NOWAHHH
 CRICK18: suka

 Stilgart: use bash...
 Stilgart: pretty sure this will divide your code size by 2
 RandomAustralian: idk how to use bash
 RandomAustralian: oh 
 RandomAustralian: for

 RandomAustralian: thats a ruby trick I think
 RandomAustralian: Ok i got code that is 53 characters long
 RandomAustralian: idk if others will beat me tho
 RandomAustralian: annnnd
 RandomAustralian: someone got 22
 Stilgart: seems I was pessimistic with my "divide by 2"

 misteeque: Anyone know why your tests all pass and then you end up with a random, not 100% percentage, after submission? It's really frustrating
 5DN1L: Because you cannot rely on the limited number of test cases to cover all possible buggy codes in the world
 samiriscool: ay whats up fellow coders
 5DN1L: Having said that, there are some puzzles where the coverage of test cases is not wide enough
 5DN1L: Better check own code first before blaming the test cases, though
 5DN1L: You can always create custom test cases for yourself
 misteeque: I'm super new to the platform and was not aware that the tests you run against are not the tests you are judged by. Might seem logical, but not always, when you're under the pressure of time&#160;:)) Did not blame the tests, I really wanted to understand how the platfirm works
 5DN1L: Yeah, they are different, otherwise what's the point of having both test cases and validators?&#160;;)
 5DN1L: Try harder, you can do it
 misteeque: Well, I get what you mean. But tests for testing should cover basics, I guess. The validators ensure you don't actually hard-code the expected results
 misteeque: Anyway, fun platform
 5DN1L: Yes, that's what validators are for
 Uljahn: is it a clash? you can give a feedback and poorly designed clashes will be removed based on it
 Codeab: wait you can give feedback?
 Codeab: oh bruh im dumb everytime i finish a clash i instantly spam leave

 Wontonimo: stumping i think he said
 AntiSquid: no, the puzzle is doing the stumping
 Wontonimo: :wave: to everyone
 Wontonimo: seriously though, I'm also interested what you have tried so far
 AntiSquid: guess he sunk just like lemuria

 lemuria.py: i did manage to turn the input 90 degrees, if you understand that
 eulerscheZahl: no you didn't. you transposed it
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise the 8 wouldn't move to the opposite corner

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose</a>
 Wontonimo: what euler is say is that turning 90 degrees is different than flipping.  you flipped along the diagonal
 lemuria.py: okau
 lemuria.py: this is my current code
 lemuria.py: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/503d2818-923d-4821-85b5-2a9b8589c89b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/503d2818-923d-4821-85b5-2a9b8589c89b</a>
 lemuria.py: also why is it that i can't access pastebin items
 Wontonimo: in technical speak, that's call a transpose and the link euler sent is a fantastic link
 lemuria.py: it gives me a 404
 Wontonimo: strange.  you can also make a "snippet" using tech.io 
 Wontonimo: it's the same service as CG
 eulerscheZahl: we can see your code
 lemuria.py: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Q5L7bYJ6">https://pastebin.com/Q5L7bYJ6</a>
 Wontonimo: nope, i don't have access to pastebin.  it isn't secure
 lemuria.py: well i dont think its feasible for me to get help in this chat
 lemuria.py: lemme join the discord real quick
 eulerscheZahl: Wontonimo are you trolling?
 Wontonimo: oh ... sorry ... i was confused
 eulerscheZahl: i can open both the pastebin.com and CG paste just fine
 5DN1L: Not sure why CG paste works in Chrome but not in Firefox for me. Firefox gives me 404
 Wontonimo: but yes, pastebin is blocked by my work
 lemuria.py: oh boy i need to wait 10 minutes to chat
 eulerscheZahl: blocking pastebin sounds paranoid to me
 Wontonimo: the codingame pastebin works fine.  it isn't blocked
 eulerscheZahl: my office allows hackerrank.com but blocks hacker.org
 Mar-Cos: does anyone have tips to better learn and understand c#?
 eulerscheZahl: nick chapsas has some great videos about C# on youtube (but not the total basics, more about advanced topics)
 eulerscheZahl: i also recomment tim corey
 Wontonimo: hey lemuria.py , why are you rotating the matrix?
 lemuria.py: that's the solution i can think of
 lemuria.py: i need to solve one more loop question just to get past the first quest of "algorithms"
 Wontonimo: i think you are reading the problem wrong
 Wontonimo: in the example given
 Wontonimo: 5 10 4 320 5 10 7
 Wontonimo: you need to output 
 Wontonimo: 4 1 3 3
 Wontonimo: because for the 1st column it can handle 5 clients per instance, so you need 4 instances
 Wontonimo: for the 2nd column it can handle 10 clients per instance, so you need 1 instance
 Wontonimo: and so on , hence 4 1 3 3
 Wontonimo: there is no rotation
 lemuria.py: i thought it was vertical and stuff
 Wontonimo: the line 5 10 4 3 in the example is the number of clients per instance in each column
 lemuria.py: okay...
 Wontonimo: the lines after that is the target number of clients
 Wontonimo: so you just divide
 lemuria.py: and math ceil?
 Wontonimo: yes
 lemuria.py: and i save the results to a list and when i move on to the next row i just check against the previous list?
 Wontonimo: nope
 lemuria.py: okay
 Wontonimo: there is a hidden middle step which is
 Wontonimo: instead of calculating the output directly
 Wontonimo: calculate the target for each row
 Wontonimo: in the example it would be
 Wontonimo: 4 1 3 35 1 4 63 1 5 4
 lemuria.py: well i never had the mind to think about autoscaling and numbers and matrices, since my python knowledge was concentrated
 Wontonimo: then you do one more pass to over that to find the differences of rows 2 and on
 lemuria.py: in the areas
 lemuria.py: that i use often
 Wontonimo: the name is confusing imo, so don't really focus on the word "auto scaling"
 lemuria.py: can you continue the conversation in the discord
 Wontonimo: i've pm'd you
 lemuria.py: ok
 Westicles: and if you can't figure it out, don't forget the world needs lawn mowers as well

 Wontonimo: oh!  Ima read it now
 jacek: NNs become more and more complex, its good to be able to interpret them somehow
 TimIntellectLord: bro
 TimIntellectLord: how doi dothis
 Wontonimo: "We also investigate a new approach:measuring covariance directly between single-neuron activations and inputs. " - nice trick in the paper
 Wontonimo: bro, how do you do what?  I can't see your screen TimIntellectLord 
 TimIntellectLord: no it's find bro I got it
 Wontonimo: that trick only works well if covariance is addressed
 Wontonimo: thanks for the paper jacek!

 800miles: This is hard
 jacek: thats what she...
 800miles: Shut
 jacek:&#160;:(
 struct: please treat jacek with respect
 800miles: how do git gud
 struct: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: start with git clone. that what some high ranking users here did as well
 eulerscheZahl: on a more serious note: tough question
 struct: also depends on what you want to be good at
 eulerscheZahl: start by finding a realistic goal that you are passionate about to achieve. getting good takes a lot of time. and you won't last that long if you won't have that goal to go for
 eulerscheZahl: then find the right tools (programming language, framework, ...) for it and dig through tutorials
 eulerscheZahl: these may be blog articles, youtube tutorials, ..
 eulerscheZahl: really hard to give a generic answer
 jacek: git clone on HS bot?

 struct:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling that the detection rate is low on some games
 struct: yes
 struct: on csb you dont find any
 struct: But is way harder to find since inory bot has timer
 struct: just create a NN to detect similar bots
 struct: jacek will help
 eulerscheZahl: actually i found 1 on CSB
 eulerscheZahl: and i won't rename it to MPR. API still uses the old name
 struct: MPR?
 eulerscheZahl: mad pod racing
 Mar-Cos: for some reason i can't seem to pass the easy angle in thor's game
 struct: I guess domiko NN is deterministic
 eulerscheZahl: it is
 struct: thor episode 1 Mar-Cos?
 eulerscheZahl: but some other games like Tron or BotG are suspicious but hard to prove anything. those subtle random actions add up over time to create a completely different game
 Mar-Cos: yes , ep 1
 eulerscheZahl: paste your code here Mar-Cos
 eulerscheZahl: so we can have a look
 Wontonimo: what is Mar-Cos?
 Wontonimo: oh, a user
 eulerscheZahl: a username
 Wontonimo: haha
 eulerscheZahl: what's a Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: just some random guy
 Mar-Cos: yeah its just the 2 parts of my name cut in half
 eulerscheZahl: won't onitama?
 Mar-Cos: i just made two lines of code that go SW and W although im starting to think its not that
 jacek: euler does it detect the exact game or there could be some differences
 Wontonimo: first check N/S, and print N/S 
 Wontonimo: then ... 
 eulerscheZahl: exact actions mostly i strip messages
 eulerscheZahl: and for hypersonic i ignore the last few turns with no boxes left, as these are too random
 jacek: it wont be long before you discover i copy paster onitama bot :scream:
 jacek: from my pc
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't index community games
 jacek: it would show only the bookers anyway
 eulerscheZahl: and top100 is a good cut for official games. some community ones don't even have that many players
 eulerscheZahl: i would find a few users submitting the boss which is on github but meh
 eulerscheZahl: the website won't change anything, not like CG would take action and do some cleanup
 eulerscheZahl: but I like public shaming B)
 Wontonimo: how are you shaming?  are you flagging users that copy?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Wontonimo: how?
 eulerscheZahl: i generate a replay for each top100 player vs itself
 eulerscheZahl: then i compare replays to check if 2 bots do the exact same things
 eulerscheZahl: those are highly likely (false positives on kutulu) to be the same bot
 Wontonimo: so long as they don't have a strong random component
 eulerscheZahl: i have a list of identical replays for each game leaderboard and a user profile where you see the bots of each player
 Wontonimo: which would mean they probably are not in top 100
 eulerscheZahl: yes, random ruins it. which is why i don't find anything in some games
 eulerscheZahl: let's have a look at (searching...)
 Wontonimo: can you set the board seed?
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: i know, i guess i should have asked euler if the test sets the board seed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/583636739">https://www.codingame.com/replay/583636739</a>vs<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/583636794">https://www.codingame.com/replay/583636794</a>
 eulerscheZahl: starts really similar. but at some point it breaks
 eulerscheZahl: thus I don't flag it
 struct: I guess you can set a&#160;% per game
 struct: but it will probably create many false positives
 Westicles: they must do some cleanup, otherwise there would be a ton of deleted accounts
 Wontonimo: if &gt;=80% match reported as "&gt;=80% match" then it isn't a false positive, it is just info
 struct: they did Westicles
 jacek: what if 80% is the optimal line of play
 eulerscheZahl: I already flag <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/583803217">https://www.codingame.com/replay/583803217</a> with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/583819157">https://www.codingame.com/replay/583819157</a>one is Java, the other is C++. pretty sure that it's a false positive
 jacek: convert c++ to java? ezpz
 eulerscheZahl: wait a second, those don't even have the same frame count. looks like my kutulu compare is broken
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: for some games you can just take the game summary to get a full list of parsed actions
 nolcoder: hi
 eulerscheZahl: on other games it does not work (sparse summary) and you have to look at the actual bot output
 eulerscheZahl: which is probably what I should do for kutulu
 Wontonimo: there must be a published bot for hypersonic that all those people copied.  it is also interesting to note that although they all have the same actions, the score spread is 2 whole points
 eulerscheZahl: kimiyuki, 3rd of the contest, is on github
 struct: its the bot that got rank 3
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: if i could beam myself back in time by 5 years, i could become 3rd myself with the knowledge I gained here&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: while i finished 54th in my first ever CG contest
 eulerscheZahl: i even saw the possibility of beam search. but was sitting at 100 sims while i have &gt; 10k now
 Wontonimo: if i could beam myself back in time 30 years, I'd be the worst programmer because there is no internet
 Scarfield: if i could beam myself back in time by 5 years, i could bet on some games
 jacek: betfield
 Scarfield: that would be my website by now
 Westicles: I had internet 30 years ago.. Er, I think
 TransByrd: no that is not true, internet is 27 years ago
 Westicles: can't say that i agree with that
 struct: Westicles created the internet
 Scarfield: internE.T.
 Westicles: We had project Athena, I think that is considered to count

 struct: which frame jacek?
 eulerscheZahl: close to the end struct, it misses the ball
 jacek: most of them?
 jacek: it rarely goes straight to the ball and the center
 eulerscheZahl: almost as if it doesn't know that it can turn left too
 struct: also you seem to have off by 1 error or something
 eulerscheZahl: but it does occasionally, so that's not the bug
 jacek: it learns at first that going by circles gives him some points
 jacek: off by 1 error?
 struct: yes 11 sec
 struct: you go after the ball and miss it
 struct: at 2 sec the ball is going straight to you and you seem to avoid it
 jacek: its due to going in circles too much
 struct: is this NN?
 jacek: neuroevolution
 jacek: for each generation it evaluates by 40 random games
 struct: train it again but with reversed map, so it goes left
 struct: :p
 Rugia: guys, how to code
 jacek: first try to decode
 jacek: and do the opposite
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Same for living.
 Wontonimo: seriously though, what lang are you trying to learn Rugia&#160;?
 Wontonimo: if you are willing to learn javascript, go to youtube and searh "The Coding Train"  great stuff on that channel
 Rugia: i just want to understand why/when/what shall i type in
 struct: depends on what you want to do
 Rugia: hmm, let it be games
 struct: C#, C++
 Rugia: oki, what about swift?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :scream:
 struct: iphone games?
 Rugia: yes
 struct: well I think swift is mainly used by iphone
 Wontonimo: google "popularity of programming languages over time" Rugia
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: 'cause popular things are de facto good things, as everybody knows.
 Wontonimo: popularity imho is related to how employable you are if you know that skill.  it doesn't relate to income though
 Wontonimo: if you get employed, you'll get more experience coding instead of experience looking for a coding job
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :smirk:
 jacek: has anyone saw the cowboy bebop on netflix yet?
 H00n: god no!
 jacek: is it bad/good?
 H00n: it's a netflix adaption
 jacek: anime hardly fits into live-action
 struct: seems bad
 struct: I didnt watch it though
 H00n: the anime was good
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/cowboy_bebop_2021">https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/cowboy_bebop_2021</a>
 struct: 50% = bad
 Rugia: see u space cowboy
 jacek: welp im afraid of netflix stuff
 H00n: indeed
 Rugia: guess im gonna try to start with Python
 H00n: the destroyer of childhood memories
 Rugia: thanks guys
 struct: netflix has some decent shows though
 struct: some of the marvel ones were nice
 H00n: well, Marvel and DC died for me&#160;:/
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Rarely those they produce on their own...
 DomiKo: Marvel last Chinese one is really nice
 H00n: not a fan of woke culture but everyone his/her/its own
 H00n: Ruga you won't regret learning python
 H00n: there's some syntactic sugar in there one misses in other languages
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :nauseated_face:
 jacek: sugar? what if hes on keto
 Rugia: any advices in learning?
 DomiKo: you will fail a lot, don't worry about it
 Rugia: whats the ket?
 Rugia: keto*
 H00n: I learned from books
 Wontonimo: hey Rugia , here are some easier python challenges&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 Rugia: im already in love of that community)
 jacek: python is quite easy for some quick stuff
 H00n: so is every other interpreted language
 H00n: except for php ofcourse
 Wontonimo: keto is used as shorthand to mean a carb free diet.  it is the main thihng you can test in blood and urine to see if your body is using ketones instead of insulin to process energy
 Wontonimo: ketones in blood = burning fat or muscle , insulin = burning sugar
 Rugia: ah oki, sry. English isnt  mine native language)
 Wontonimo: same for most people here.  it is not a problem
 Rugia: well, now i go learn
 Rugia: thanks and good luck&#160;;)
 Rugia: see u space sowboys
 Scarfield: there is also russian chat room, /Ru is it(?)
 Scarfield: #Ru *
 Rugia: yeah, but they r silence
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Pyhon ate another poor child...&#160;:(
 jacek: oh
 Rugia: why u scarring me?)
 Scarfield: ah, but as long as we can understand each other, people usually dont mind bad grammer etc
 Wontonimo: haha ... i'd suggest javascript Rugia
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: *grammar
 Wontonimo: Python is good also
 Scarfield: xD
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :scream:
 Wontonimo: javascript is fun because you can do stuff in the browser very easily
 Scarfield: was waiting for someone to miss the joke :p
 eulerscheZahl: my compiler is obsessed about grammar mistakes&#160;:(
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Stop perverting this poor innocent
 jacek: grammar nazi eh
 Rugia: hmm well, i was actually thinking about  create games at first
 Rugia: at least try
 Wontonimo: you can make lots of game using javascript and anyone can play them without having to install anything&#160;!
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Stop him!
 Rugia: wow
 H00n: Lazer is a decent 2d game engine based on pixijs based on webgl
 jacek: they need to install browser first
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a> has a lot of tutorials that could be good for game dev, but there are probably better sources to start learning it, i havent coded games myself
 H00n: if you want to write games, you could pick up godot, it's open source and the community is half decent
 H00n: there are tons of beginner level tutorials
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: And you can code in C++ \o/
 H00n: plus you can see your code in action without spending too much time on boilerplate
 Kerfluffle: if you're willing to spend some money, gamedev.tv has a lot of great courses and a lot of community help on their discord
 H00n: or just give all your money to me, I'd be thankful
 Kerfluffle: gamedev.tv has courses in unity, unreal, and godot
 Rugia: wow guys
 jacek: whould in right mind would pay for tutorial? only the people who pay for papers would do that
 Rugia: i cant see links in my browser already xD
 H00n: I buy books on a regular basis
 H00n: and my company is paying for advanced education
 H00n: sooooo
 H00n: it's not that far fetched
 Rugia: well, i have so many free tutorial links, guess its not a time for me to pay for that yet 
 jacek: oO
 H00n: dw there's no need to pay for beginner level knowledge. Only do it if you want compiled knowledge right away without spending time searching for it
 H00n: even then you first need to look for the content which is right for you
 H00n: take your time and enjoy the journey
 H00n: save old codes you will want to look at them some years in the future
 Wontonimo: and practice.  do the doing
 Wontonimo: reading and watching is not enough
 Scarfield: ^
 H00n: +1
 Rugia: thats what i want the most 
 Rugia: now i take my leave, thanks guys
 Scarfield: cya
 Scarfield: *see you, if not clear :D
 H00n: never seen you to begin with :thinking:
 H00n: have a good time!
 Scarfield: :see_no_evil:
 Scarfield: lol euler got 1st back on the global leaderboard, the fight is on it seems
 struct: he just needs to play 1 of the games I ported
 jacek: Y?
 struct: any of the Ys
 Scarfield: ⬡
 JulioKukonenko: Hello guys
 jacek: good evening
 landyns.: help meeeee
 landyns.: plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
 landyns.: hello
 Mar-Cos: hiii, whats the best way to learn C#?
 rootm15: Hi, maybe start with Microsoft Docs, they have whole Get Started series
 The_coder_Awaits: haha nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob
 Mr.Presqu: Hi, anyone had that issue where COC passes all test then at submit gives you 66%?
 Uljahn: just give a feedback after the clash and admins will fix it or delete
 Mr.Presqu: seems like using library instead of hard coded solution will pass. closed it already. I've signaled one or two, but with lack of feedback I gave up on doing that. Too bad for that clash coz a few of us where in that situation. Can you tell me if there are extra tests we don't get to see?
 GamingGnawer: Woohoo I just completed a clash 100% with NO time to spare, didn't even have time to start testing just had to submit and hope it compiles ^^
 Codeab: morning guys!
 Mr.Presqu: Morning Codeab
 Uniquetius: haiyaaaaaaaaaa
 MrMoose356: Anyone working on the weekly challenge with the Solid integers?
 landyns.: hey everyone
 chenhaorantianjiayi: helli
 chenhaorantianjiayi: hello
 Venus_62: Hey
 chenhaorantianjiayi: Someone is in the cell the phantom code?
 chenhaorantianjiayi: Someone has a Ghost in the Cell code?
 Dren: is that the cyborg factory one?
 chenhaorantianjiayi: yes
 Dren: I just wrote a basic one that sends people to random places
 Dren: good enough for first league
 Wontonimo: :wave: 
 Wontonimo: hey chenhaorantianjiayi - don't share whole solutions.  It is encouraged to share ideas, and small code segments without giving the whole game away
 chenhaorantianjiayi: ok
 Wontonimo: I've tried ghost in the cell.  it is fun
 Wontonimo: what have you tried so far chenhaorantianjiayi&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i'm in bronze
 Wontonimo: you are not in the leaderboard
 chenhaorantianjiayi: I am a pupil of China
 chenhaorantianjiayi: Primary school
 Wontonimo: oh, good morning!
 chenhaorantianjiayi: good morning
 Wontonimo: Dren had a really good suggestion&#160;: first submit code that just does something randomly
 Wontonimo: then think of 1 tiny improvement, add it, resubmit
 Wontonimo: repeat
 chenhaorantianjiayi: In fact, I said now is to use the translator translated into English.
 ZXC01: what coding language you use
 chenhaorantianjiayi: C++
 ZXC01: ok
 chenhaorantianjiayi: What do you mean?

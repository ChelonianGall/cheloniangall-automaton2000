 Husoski: Ken Thompson's B language was named in honor of the earlier BCPL language.  C was the next letter in BCPL.  The successor to C was theoretically supposed to be P, but Stroustrup named it "C with Classes" and then adopted "C++".
 Husoski: [Dennis Ritchie's C language was a substantially improved version of B, designed for rewriting the Unix kernel in a "high level language."]
 dctrdee: ur sus

 ja_fica: robostac, you should resubmit your bot in C4, you deserve the 1st...
 ja_fica: its more consistent, I made _Royale get first because my bots sucks against him
 Naknik: I just finished my first contribution, if u have a name idea, please comment<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7278a453f4f755a659f474825d11ad216327">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7278a453f4f755a659f474825d11ad216327</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so you are talking about prime digits rather than the full numbers in the input?
 eulerscheZahl: the example should just help in understanding, not introduce new rules
 NinjaDoggy: eulerscheZahl say something unique
 NinjaDoggy: i already commented on that :P
 eulerscheZahl: hfudihbduij
 eulerscheZahl: unique enough?
 Naknik: Yeah so you are talking about prime digits rather than the full numbers in the input?
 eulerscheZahl: ah right, scrolled down to see your comment
 NinjaDoggy: dang he got me
 Naknik: I changed it
 Naknik: oops didnt notice I mistakenly copy pasted your message lol
 michaellan: NinjaDoggy
 xxd: I think I know you
 xxd: I remember you were wearing a codingame shirt in our class
 xxd: thats actually how i was introduced to codingame
 xxd: damn this is nostalgic
 eulerscheZahl: was he sleeping because he put an all-nighter to win the tshirt last second? then it probably was ninja doggy
 69razer69: i want a codingame shirt
 Naknik: how do u even get one lol
 69razer69: yeah how
 Naknik: hey! wanna support minors? |upvote this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7278a453f4f755a659f474825d11ad216327?comment=51137">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7278a453f4f755a659f474825d11ad216327?comment=51137</a>
 69razer69: yeah i am working on it
 Naknik: support minors today!
 69razer69: btw 123 goes to 5 right 
 Naknik: yes
 69razer69: 55555 -&gt; 25 -&gt; 7
 Naknik: yeah
 69razer69: oh 
 69razer69: when fall 2021 will begin
 eulerscheZahl: my guess: November (but i don't know)
 eulerscheZahl: at least it was November last year
 69razer69: so top 10 in clash of code dont get tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: no, only contests
 69razer69: sad
 Naknik: euler
 Naknik: if I have a WIP
 Naknik: how do I release it
 Naknik: do I need to remake it?
 eulerscheZahl: you go to the edit page and change the status to "ready"
 Naknik: cant find it
 Naknik: not ready yet 
 Naknik: so doesnt matter
 Naknik: I wanna get 10 upvotes before
 eulerscheZahl: i never created a clash myself. i just know how it works for SDK contributions
 eulerscheZahl: (these are more likely to receive 10 upvotes also)
 Naknik: what are SDK
 Naknik: contributions
 eulerscheZahl: something like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tryangle-catch">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tryangle-catch</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dice-duel">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dice-duel</a>
 eulerscheZahl: not purely textbased but with graphics and interaction
 Naknik: i like mine tbh
 Naknik: its similar to the happy numbers puzzle
 69razer69: i made two contributions a puzzle and a clash my next contribution gonna be a game
 eulerscheZahl: great, prepare for a long journey&#160;:)
 69razer69: did u made a game before i mean for codingame
 69razer69: oh btw i think today brackeys gamejam will start
 eulerscheZahl: i made a few for CodinGame. some smaller stuff before outside of CG but really nothing big
 69razer69: any advices?
 eulerscheZahl: for CG games?
 69razer69: yup
 eulerscheZahl: you start here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there are dozens of existing games already. you can look up their source code to see how certain things can be done
 eulerscheZahl: the hardest parts are having a nice idea for a game and the artwork (at least for me)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/codingame-sdk-assets">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/codingame-sdk-assets</a>this links to a few sources of free assets
 eulerscheZahl: my favorite one is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://craftpix.net/freebies/">https://craftpix.net/freebies/</a>
 69razer69: ah so is there a doc for how the game api works in cg or i have to dig in this source codes
 eulerscheZahl: you start by reading the docs that I linked first
 mikhiyoe: hi gaiz
 69razer69: are all this assests free license
 eulerscheZahl: other games might help you if the docs aren't clear enough
 mikhiyoe: this world chat feature reminds me of clasj of clans
 mikhiyoe: lol
 eulerscheZahl: you have to be careful about the license. the craftpix freebies are all free to use
 mikhiyoe: why doensn't codingame has dark mode
 eulerscheZahl: for some other sites you have to give credits. just link the source in the statement
 mikhiyoe: my eyes are damaged
 eulerscheZahl: CG has dark mode in the IDE
 69razer69: freebies
 69razer69:&#160;?
 mikhiyoe: IDE toh obviously
 mikhiyoe: but in these home screen etc
 mikhiyoe: that's main
 eulerscheZahl: chat has dark mode too
 mikhiyoe: bruuuhhh:nerd:
 mikhiyoe: where yu from
 eulerscheZahl: hover over my avatar and you'll see&#160;;)
 Westicles: chat dark mode is #fr
 mikhiyoe: wtfwhy don't yu tell me
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 69razer69: hes #1
 mikhiyoe: oh wow
 mikhiyoe: #1
 eulerscheZahl: i tell you how to find out for all users without asking everyone
 mikhiyoe: you moderator or waht
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but not staff
 mikhiyoe: that's pretty good, you know
 69razer69: my goal is top 10 clash of code
 mikhiyoe: so tell mehow is this codingame differenet
 mikhiyoe: from codeforces/atcoder
 eulerscheZahl: there are puzzles similar to codeforces gym
 eulerscheZahl: but also multiplayer and optimization games
 mikhiyoe: i meanits good, then alsoyou may know something that i don't
 mikhiyoe: yeah, optimization gamesthat's true
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>here you can play a game. against other programs that were uploaded by other users
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/574646978">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/574646978</a>you won't find suh a thing on codeforces
 mikhiyoe: oh rihgt
 mikhiyoe: thanks
 mikhiyoe: where you work thenhaving sonice cp skills
 69razer69: check my puzzle

 mikhiyoe: no
 69razer69: not u i bet you cant solve it :sunglasses:
 jacek: :upside_down:
 mikhiyoe: i can
 mikhiyoe: but i won't
 Westicles: Your contribution looks like a 2nd grader texted it
 mikhiyoe: whom are you talking to?
 mikhiyoe: bruh
 Westicles: the guy who posted his contribution
 Westicles: sista
 mikhiyoe: oooo
 mikhiyoe: theank god
 mikhiyoe: i thouht you saying to me
 mikhiyoe: nice chat feature this has
 mikhiyoe: can we get a girlfriend here.?
 69razer69: lol chill 
 martinpapa69: if you want a 40yo girlfriend with :cucumber:, sure you can
 mikhiyoe: lol
 mikhiyoe: btw, how to find geometric mean of and b?
 seshoumara: ruby used to be available to bash clashes as a command, but now it is not?
 Westicles: you have to use the full path /usr/local/bin/ruby
 Westicles: for golf you can sometimes use /*/*/b*/ruby
 seshoumara: thank you
 Westicles: or I should say /*/*/b*/r*y
 seshoumara: And dc isn't available?? It's like the oldest UNIX program or so.
 ProCoder03: does codingame sync has any vs code plugin&#160;??
 ProCoder03: * a
 whatevericando4you: 8/2(2+2)=?

 martinpapa69: avx convulution yepp: 3x speedup :ok_hand:
 Chaipzor: sup! How can i challenge a friend in coders strike back?
 Chaipzor: we follow eachother, but we cannot invite
 jacek: you cant challenge in multiplayer game
 eulerscheZahl: you have to delete the default AI and place your friend. you'll only find players in the top1000 of your own league (or below)
 eulerscheZahl: so the opponent selection in CSB is such a 5% feature
 TobiasA: space shooter is harder than i expected
 jacek: oh its been approved
 jacek: loal just stay in one place and fire missle randomly left or right
 TobiasA: :joy:
 chaitanya.patil: hey bruh
 chaitanya.patil: i wanna ask
 chaitanya.patil: what da dog doing   
 chaitanya.patil: :grimacing:
 jacek: oO
 AllYourTrees: oh wow royale took #1 in C4
 YurkovAS: AllYourTrees you use NN or mcts in C4?
 AllYourTrees: ya NN. ja fica definitely boosted me with their latest submits. i was #9 solidly, then the rankings shifted a bunch
 AllYourTrees: a bit confusing tbh lol
 YurkovAS: do you use avx? this give huge speedup
 AllYourTrees: no
 AllYourTrees: i think rust auto does it? i tried using it but it was slower
 AllYourTrees: well at least it was slower for NN portion, i haven't put anywhere else
 AllYourTrees: what approach are you using YurkovAS?
 YurkovAS: i'm use mcts, add avx for win check in move - this give huge performance improvement
 YurkovAS: but not score improvement
 YurkovAS: and adding avx is was interesting for me
 AllYourTrees: interesting!!
 basically: hellow
 basically: any tips to improve the score in clash of code
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/576479368">https://www.codingame.com/replay/576479368</a>i'm show rollouts count K in first number
 AllYourTrees: wow pretty high, what was it before avx?
 YurkovAS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/576713625">https://www.codingame.com/replay/576713625</a>left - fast bitboard without avx
 AllYourTrees: oh yeah wow that is a pretty big performance boost!
 YurkovAS: with bitboard you also can fast win check with bit shifts magic
 Westicles: What's the point to these examiner achievements?  
 YurkovAS: Westicles i'm like improving app performance. And usual this give higher score in leaderboard.
 Westicles: Hi YurkovAS
 YurkovAS: hi
 Westicles: Did you guys every try to figure out what dbdr did to get his 2048 score?
 Westicles: It seems odd that nobody else can get it...
 YurkovAS: Don't know about it. I'm used beam search (online).
 Westicles: Yeah, same here
 Westicles: Oh, not actually... offline for me
 Q12: Did you see the new feature, Budding examiner?
 Westicles: Yep.  I was wondering if the rankings actually do anything... I guess not.  
 Q12: I think it does, why else would they do it?
 Westicles: Just a scheme to get you to look at solutions?
 eulerscheZahl: and to order them when showing top solutions
 Westicles: Looks like they are ordered by upvotes
 eulerscheZahl: upvotes have a problem: and older solution had more time to collect upvotes
 eulerscheZahl: thus the mediocre solution might be on top. getting more visibility and thus more upvotes
 BlaiseEbuth: Problems on Codingame... Tss. Toxic community, and judas mods...
 eulerscheZahl: onboarding solutions in Java: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1qejvbv">https://prnt.sc/1qejvbv</a>
 eulerscheZahl: definitely not by score
 eulerscheZahl: maybe a mix of both to start with a non-random order when you add the new feature
 Westicles: Ah, okay that makes sense
 Westicles: Kind of difficult to compare two solutions in those tiny little windows though
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and the window doesn't even use its full size to show the code
 BlaiseEbuth: Just click to get the achevment and forget it.
 eulerscheZahl: 18 lines of code. then the same size of blank area.
 eulerscheZahl: and scrollbars only show up when you hover over it
 <b>**eulerscheZahl doesn't care about the achievement</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: i won't do CG's work on ranking solutions
 BlaiseEbuth: Not a priority
 Q12: another problem is ranking solutions which isn't in your language (English)
 Westicles: I assume ultimately you won't be able to see solutions without ranking first?
 Q12: you can skip ranking
 Q12: at the bottom right
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles wonders if we can skip it in the future?
 BlaiseEbuth: For now that even allows you to see non-published solution...
 eulerscheZahl: really? :o
 BlaiseEbuth: In certain cases yes. When there's not enough solutions in your language, it seems the site takes some liberties...
 BlaiseEbuth: At least two reports in that way from regular users on Fr
 eulerscheZahl: at least it keeps the language. i didn't get a solution shown when I was the first (or 2nd?) to solve it in C#
 eulerscheZahl: probably the 2nd after Westicles
 Panavia_tornado: Points in code vs zombies are only given for the levels that are in the test cases or will there be other levels in the submit?
 eulerscheZahl: submit has different testcases
 eulerscheZahl: to avoid hardcoding certain tests (spoiler: does not work)
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably a bug, cause doesn't happen anytime. I found a puzzle with no published solutions, and made a test with two other users, and nothing happened. Though the users who reported the problem are pretty sure of them.
 Westicles: Well, if it is C++ with a wrapper, tell them to give it an upvote :P
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 Panavia_tornado: Is there a limit to the choice of starting location for zombies/humans/Ash e.g. distance&gt;2000 from Ash to zombies at the starting point?
 Panavia_tornado: I'm trying to do a simulation of the game in an external editor for a genetic algorithm or neural network.
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I just made a rookie mistake
 MSmits: In C#
 MSmits: I was building a 20 MB long string by using +=  instead of stringbuilder :P
 MSmits: wasnt done after 15 mins even
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that's really inefficient
 eulerscheZahl: once i got to rewrite another program and had a look at the code (wondering why opening a 10MB file easily takes 1min)
 eulerscheZahl: that file contained a list of points. the code was like:create an empty array
 eulerscheZahl: while (point to add)resize array by +1, add that 1 point
 eulerscheZahl: pretty much what your string concat does too
 eulerscheZahl: with the exception that the program I got to see was in Delphi. There aren't even Lists (except for the Stringlist)
 MSmits: ahh yeah, it was pretty dumb of me. I was using the string concat thing with my opening books because they were all tiny, but now i was trying to generate data for my nn and that was a lot more.
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i also use the += on strings when I don't expect much data. it's just easier to code and more readable
 eulerscheZahl: and implicitly calls ToString() for extra convenience
 MSmits: yea, it's usually no problem
 MSmits: inside CG context anyways
 Kepe55: what's with that "If you ever get stuck, use a hasmap" saying?
 ProCoder03: isn't it supposed to be a "Java" sayings&#160;?!? 
 Kepe55: Not sure, but do hashmaps really help if you are stuck?
 BlaiseEbuth: If you get stuck use a context?
 martinpapa69: i've you get stuck. call your stepbro
 BlaiseEbuth: :eggplant:
 spokr: fr
 BlaiseEbuth: fr?
 Tsloa: frfr??
 michaellan: I want to write NN
 BlaiseEbuth: So write NN...
 martinpapa69: or write an N
 michaellan: N
 michaellan: Panavia_tornado: you dont pick starting location
 AspectCodin: hola
 muck: my brain is about to explode
 michaellan: from what
 michaellan: i know the feeling
 michaellan: and you better not say a clash
 TobiasA: it's most likely clash of code
 TobiasA: except if it isn't
 IndecisionTree: it is
 jacek: meow
 SevenGaming: meow
 oddly: HOLA
 oddly: how are you guys?
 martinpapa69: :ok_hand:
 oddly: what is the best place for practice on this website
 JimmyJams: I literally coded myself a girlfriends using a fine tuned model of GPT-3 based on past conversations I've had with my exs and some of my mom and sister.
 martinpapa69: have you seen the quest map thingy on the start page&#160;?
 JimmyJams: how sad are you boys that you're not on my level right now?

 Prof.Moriarty: New here, a had a lot of work doing a puzzle and it was the "easy", do you guys have any tip on how to improve my skills? (it is python the language I am studying)
 jacek: what easy puzzle?
 jacek: there are some that i find quite medium, and there are medium/hard ones that i find easy
 oddly: where can i practice? like everything from nothing
 oddly: i have 0 exp in this feild.
 Prof.Moriarty: temperature.py had a good time in it haha
 oddly:&#160;:&gt; thanks
 oddly: where is that again? lmao
 jacek: there is search at top
 oddly: ok thanks &lt;3'
 oddly: hello there! does anyone know how to  finish the first ai test
 FBF_Luis: hi, has anyone here done the defibrillators problem 100%? 
 FBF_Luis: Can't do validator 2&#160;:/
 michaellan: is that the dijkstra one
 FBF_Luis: no, it's an easy one
 FBF_Luis: the point is to find the nearest defibrillator based on coordenades
 BlaiseEbuth: use radians not degrees
 BlaiseEbuth: Or the reverse, don't remember. But there's a conversion to do
 FBF_Luis: maybe that's the thing
 FBF_Luis: will try that
 FBF_Luis: it worked, but that wasn't the problem
 FBF_Luis: formula said cos((a+b)/2) but I was using cos(a+b)/2
 FBF_Luis: and the conversion to radians is not needed
 michaellan: it should be needed for the next level
 FBF_Luis: maybe, haven't look at it yet
 Wontonimo: hey :wave: what's the topic?
 FBF_Luis: the defibrillator problem (1st level)
 FBF_Luis: was not getting one of the validators, but turns out I'm just dumb xD
 Scarfield: Thats usually the problem, pesky computers do what you tell them :p
 FBF_Luis: stupid computers, can't even do whatever they want
 Scarfield: they should know what you want them to do, not what you tell them :rage:
 spokr: this is why i hate computers
 KalamariKing: you could just get good
 michaellan: bru
 Nanosplitter: Does anyone know how I can programatically feed data into python's input() function on my local machine?
 Nanosplitter: I'm trying to run test runs of my code on my local machine and I want to copy the input from codingame and put it into a text file that my code's input() function will read like it does in codingame's IDE
 Nanosplitter: (Yes I have tried googling it, I can't find any useful information about it)
 michaellan: sure
 michaellan: It's known as redirection and its super duper useful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15680530/bash-read-stdin-from-file-and-write-stdout-to-file">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15680530/bash-read-stdin-from-file-and-write-stdout-to-file</a>
 michaellan: so you'd just do
 michaellan: python your_file.py &lt; your_input_file
 michaellan: Nanosplitter: see above
 Nanosplitter: That's super helpful thank you!
 LittleFlea: hello all.
 Nanosplitter: xxd When I try and run it like that I get the error "The '&lt;' operator is reserved for future use.". I think it is because I am on windows and am using powershell. I googled it and found this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2148746/the-operator-is-reserved-for-future-use">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2148746/the-operator-is-reserved-for-future-use</a>
 Nanosplitter: But I don't really understand the top answer
 Nanosplitter: Thanks for all your help, I'm a total command line noob lol
 Nanosplitter: Oh hey! I found a workaround: I put this into the command line and it seems to have worked cmd /c 'python solver.py &lt; input.txt'
 Nanosplitter: I'm not quite sure why it worked though
 Wontonimo: magic
 Nanosplitter: true
 michaellan: you also could've just searched up "redirection in powershell" or something along those lines
 Wontonimo: that sounds hard
 jacek: thats what she...

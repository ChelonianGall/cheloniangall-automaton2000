 JustinTruong: wow i love codingame
 DW1: ye
 JustinTruong: COC fun
 Justin-Truong: yeah
 jacek: good morning
 littlebear: good morning
 Maxim251: morning good
 TechTheAwesome: mornings, afternoon for me :D
 JustinTruong: guys are you free
 JustinTruong: could you check my code
 JustinTruong: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/30f944e8-0af7-45c2-9a3e-1e7f2e8ad0aa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/30f944e8-0af7-45c2-9a3e-1e7f2e8ad0aa</a>
 IzharMashkif: Hi all
 JustinTruong: oh i get it
 littlebear: thrust
 JustinTruong: what the difference
 littlebear: it hold number type and string
 littlebear: at same time
 JustinTruong: You mean my trust var is wrong?
 littlebear: i think
 JustinTruong: thanks bro
 JustinTruong: I fixxed it
 littlebear:&#160;:)
 JustinTruong: I know what my problem is
 JustinTruong: have you play coder strike back little bear
 littlebear: oh no
 littlebear: i should
 JustinTruong: try it
 littlebear: ok
 JustinTruong: it fun
 MiyamuraIzumi: new account Justin?
 JustinTruong: yeah
 JustinTruong: i made this account to pratice COC
 JustinTruong: and try to make stupid question
 JustinTruong: however COC in this account is much higher than my old one
 TechTheAwesome: I believe ranking rewards consistency
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;?
 TechTheAwesome: so If you haven't play COC for a bit, on your old acc then you'll be ranked lower :o
 MiyamuraIzumi: I don't care COC
 TechTheAwesome: oh just realized that was an 40 min ago conversation xD
 JustinZhang: Why you don't care about COC
 jacek: there are some many other things on this site than coc
 JustinZhang: i know
 jacek: :tada:
 DW1: Hi
 littlebear: o/
 MiyamuraIzumi: well finally, I abandon solver and try to tune the UCT formular on UTTT, my rank grow from 105 -&gt; 80th
 ProCoder03: why&#160;??
 MiyamuraIzumi: the bias constant is not good
 MiyamuraIzumi: also I fix some timeout problem
 ProCoder03: Ohh....
 MiyamuraIzumi: for solver, I don't understand much on this, so failed on itergrate it
 ProCoder03: :open_mouth:
 MSmits: this is my solver for Yavalath if it helps:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f5ebb03c-138f-4644-915f-9b336e713872">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f5ebb03c-138f-4644-915f-9b336e713872</a>
 MSmits: status is the result of the last selected node and is either -1, 0 or 1 for loss/draw/win
 MSmits: my selected nodes are in an array and i am traversing them backwards while solving (which reduces the selected count)
 MSmits: i stop solving when it encounters an unsolved node
 MSmits: (unsolved == status 2)
 MSmits: mmh i should define a constant UNSOLVED = 2. That'd be much cleaner looking
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank you, MSmits, I will try again&#160;:)
 struct: hi
 bear314: hi :D
 INVIZE: Всем привет ебать&#160;!
 MSmits: hey struct, Yavalath says it's your contribution!
 MSmits: this makes me happy
 MSmits: when did they fix this?
 MSmits: I mean when did they fix the problem you created :P
 struct: hm it doesnt show for me
 MSmits: maybe it just says in the IDE then?
 struct: ah on the ide it shows yeah
 struct: no idea when they updated it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/qRkfHJM">https://imgur.com/a/qRkfHJM</a>
 struct: since usually i dont check ide
 struct: yeah I see
 MSmits: hmm maybe it was always this way. it doesnt say on the main page
 MSmits: so maybe they didnt do anything
 struct:  I guess its fine like this&#160;:+p
 MSmits: yeah ok
 struct: sometimes can be tricky to update this kind of stuff
 MSmits: yeah, I'd for sure mess stuff like this up
 struct: Multiple db changes can be needed
 struct: But is shows on my list of contributions :D
 MSmits: oh cool
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/705ZHKj.png">https://i.imgur.com/705ZHKj.png</a>
 MSmits: but this was done by a different account right? So they must really have changed this later
 struct: yes
 MSmits: well good
 struct: I just asked if it was possible, it was my fault anyways :p
 MSmits: yeah, they would not have done this for any person
 MSmits: only for the struct
 struct: im sure they would do for more people
 MSmits: well maybe a handful
 MSmits: still trying to figure a Y thing out
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/f1bhjC2">https://imgur.com/a/f1bhjC2</a>
 MSmits: if you're red, is there any point in playing on 1 1 unless it's the last safe option?
 MSmits: cant make a win that includes 1 1 and the opponent cant play on 1 1, not even to win with it
 struct: maybe to delay idk
 struct: i would play 1 4
 MSmits: like a zugzwang?
 struct: since game is already lost
 MSmits: yeah zugzwang is my only doubt
 MSmits: not sure if they exist beyond avoiding playing insta loss hexes
 MSmits: my bot actually played 1 4 there&#160;:)
 MSmits: good eye :0
 struct: usually zugzwang only applies when you only have 1 forced move
 struct: but on bt if only forced moves are possible I usually expand again
 struct: for example if 2 pieces can capture a  7th row pawn
 struct: both the moves were forced
 struct: So i expand them again
 struct: But its a lower ammount on yavalath  non forced must be a bit larger
 MSmits: yeah, i mostly meant that there could be a situation where you have to choose between 2 moves and the other player can then make use of your choice to defeat you
 MSmits: not necessarily forced moves
 MSmits: I'm not sure if these exist. Not moving at all always seems worse than choosing the best of these 2
 MSmits: so if you choose a useless move like the 1 1 move i showed, it will always be worse I think
 MSmits: because as a safe move, you can always leave it for later, the opponent cant play there anyways
 MSmits: this game has such simple rules, but the tactics are complex
 MSmits: which is why i am unsure
 struct: so if you play 1 1
 struct: blue plays 1 5
 struct: forcing 2 5
 struct: then blue plays 1 4
 struct: and its unstopable
 MSmits: it is unstoppable regardless. That wasn't my point though&#160;:)
 MSmits: I meant is 1 1 a good prune
 MSmits: to reduce branching
 MSmits: and solve sooner
 struct: ah I see
 MSmits: there's a lot of these moves in late game
 MSmits: if i remove them from consideration i could solve 2-3 plies sooner or something
 MSmits: this one is actually too tricky to detect because of the 1 2 and 1 3 loss hexes, but often a hex is completely blocked in all directions, thats easy to detect
 MSmits: like 6 6
 MSmits: but 6 6 is different because blue can still play there
 MSmits: which actually makes it a better move, because you block one of his safe moves
 struct: yeah tricky games
 struct: sometimes blocking opponent safe moves can be good
 struct: even if it does nothing for you short term
 MSmits: yeah, i think this is why my bot does really well vs those NN's, they are good at the whole trapping and forcing, for early wins, but the random rollout really works to maximize your safe moves and minimize the opponents
 MSmits: of course i use the book to get out of the traps
 MSmits: random rolled games often end when safe moves run out so moves that maximize them work well
 MSmits: no reason a NN can't learn to do this ofc, but it's hard when during training most games end early.
 struct: yeah the game becomes different
 MSmits: yeah from what i read about human players, they really like the game until they learn how to avoid traps and most games become a grind to 61 hexes
 MSmits: completely changing the game
 MSmits: of course AI's are much better at laying traps, but still the progression is similar
 eulerscheZahl: hey geppoz, I see you joined yare
 struct: hi euler
 struct: are you doing cf?
 struct: im going to try it for the first time
 cheerfuldino: save me
 cheerfuldino: HAHAHAHA
 cheerfuldino: What tech are yall suing
 MSmits: if I had to choose I'd sue facebook, with the genocide and all
 struct: maybe twitter could be next
 MSmits: possibly
 eulerscheZahl: no codeforces, struct. played soccer. way too tired for clear thinking
 eulerscheZahl: but i know it's a bigger round today
 struct: Maybe I can solve A and B
 eulerscheZahl: you surely can
 struct: I registered yesterday solved a few problems to practice
 eulerscheZahl: up to D it's usually doable with common sense and basic knowledge
 struct: I kinda struggle on math ones though
 littlebear: ever tried atcoder&#160;?
 struct: I haven't
 littlebear: ok
 eulerscheZahl: i know atcoder by name and played one of their heuristic contests
 eulerscheZahl: there are just so many sites out there. I played 1 or 2 contests on codechef
 eulerscheZahl: found my account list again<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/accounts/?search=eulerschezahl">https://clist.by/accounts/?search=eulerschezahl</a>
 sologamer1: help
 littlebear: just ask :p
 sologamer1: I need help on coders strike back
 littlebear: which league
 sologamer1: It doesnt say league anywhere
 eulerscheZahl: it does, at the top left
 eulerscheZahl: something like "wood 2"
 eulerscheZahl: above the replay viewer
 sologamer1: nope
 eulerscheZahl: have you submitted any code yet?
 sologamer1: i am trying to figure it out
 eulerscheZahl: you have some code to start with. but it uses Y twice for the target coordinate
 eulerscheZahl: fix this and you are good to go
 sologamer1: I just won the first test without moving
 sologamer1: the thrust doesn't work.
 littlebear: change thrust value to 100
 littlebear: in comments or in contributions can we use latex&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 sologamer1: The thrusters still dont work when I put in 100 thrust value.
 littlebear: ok
 littlebear: it should work i think @solo
 sologamer1: i'm confused
 struct: paste your code here
 apcoder: hey can anyone help me with the bot one with collision.I am not understanding anything.
 ProCoder03: In what&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: CSB
 ProCoder03: CSB&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: you can ignore collisions until you reach gold or even legend
 eulerscheZahl: btw I saw you on yare as well ProCoder03. are you playing the contest?
 ProCoder03: Well I am just trying....
 ProCoder03: Js is kinda hard and new for me&#160;!!
 eulerscheZahl: new for me as well. but not that hard
 eulerscheZahl: just write it as if it's C# and do a quick search if it's wrong
 sologamer1: I do need help with the angles of bots
 ProCoder03: Okay, That will be easy....
 ProCoder03: sologamer1, you will get it as an input...
 ProCoder03: nextCheckpointAngle , or something like that..
 MSmits: hey struct, i partially coded that pruning thing we discussed. Speeds up solving by a factor of 3 in late games
 MSmits: but i still don't know for sure if it is correct
 MSmits: it's roughly the same as solving 2 plies sooner
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: I know whats going to happen. I am going to use this in my meta mcts and then after 2 weeks find out the pruning is flawed :P
 MSmits: probably should set up some kind of test
 struct: wow I solved one problem...
 struct: fml
 struct: Understanding the statement is something else
 struct: nice msmits, you should do tests yeah
 Scarfield: why test when you can assume there are no errors and live in blissfull ignorance
 Scarfield: also hi :wave:
 struct: hi
 jacek: struct doesnt read statements?
 Scarfield: smitsi probably already setting up his meta mcts
 struct: jacek these statements are harder to understand than the problem
 struct: at least for me
 Scarfield: which statement, what game?
 struct: codeforces

 MiyamuraIzumi: °□
 jacek: my oh
 eulerscheZahl: hey structi had that codeforces optim contest where i spent 2 hours just to understand the task
 struct: yeah
 struct: im not really familiar with this kind of problems
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1524/problem/A">https://codeforces.com/contest/1524/problem/A</a>
 struct: I did very poorly
 struct: oh god
 struct: Also it doenst help when I pass all the test cases
 struct: but fail validators
 struct: and cant understand why
 eulerscheZahl: they have very few tests
 eulerscheZahl: and the validators aren't even final. there is the "hacking"
 eulerscheZahl: you can lock your code. and then look at the solution of others to find bugs
 eulerscheZahl: define your own testcase where you think that other code would fail to get bonus points
 struct: ah so that was what the lock was for
 struct: I had no idea
 struct: :p
 struct: ill practice the problem section more before I try it
 eulerscheZahl: neither struct nor tobou found as a user
 struct: nulte
 struct: I only solved A&#160;:(
 struct: I dindt understand the problems well enough
 struct: I took so long on A when I had the right idea from the start
 struct: this is completely different from multi on cg

 eulerscheZahl: found you
 struct: how often do they have contests?
 Illedan: Every week it feels like from my mail inbox
 eulerscheZahl: more like twice a week
 eulerscheZahl: soon it's kotlin heroes again
 eulerscheZahl: i might play it, i usually do
 TheSpooN: what's your cf id?
 MSmits: do you have to use kotlin for kotlin heroes? Or is that just a name?
 struct: you do
 Astrobytes: Use java, intellij and convert to kotlin
 MSmits: did not know euler was so familiar with this language
 struct: thespoon i think its his same handle as cg one
 MSmits: yeah i guess you can convert
 Astrobytes: worked for euler :D
 Daporan: My shoes are disintegrating, does anyone have some recommendations?
 Astrobytes: ^ Question of the Year so far
 TheSpooN: what you guys up to today
 Pappijx: can someone help with detective geek problem
 MSmits: Daporan yes, stop wearing those sports shoes. I used Nikes for like 10-15 years but they are much less durable now than they were before
 MSmits: clothing in general but also shoes are made to be less durable. People buy much more clothing than they used to, so the companies adjust to that
 MSmits: what you should buy is actual long distance walking shoes. That is what I do now. I can use them for a year
 MSmits: nikes will disintegrate in 3 months on average for me
 Daporan: Do those have a flat sole?
 MSmits: not necessarily I think
 Astrobytes: Comprehensive answer.I swear by Dr. Martens but regardless of shoe always get insoles that are correct for your feet.
 MSmits: I am no expert mind you, if you probe me with questions I fall apart
 MSmits: real walking shoes is all I'm saying
 Astrobytes: (with suitable insoles)
 MSmits: last time i had nikes, i used 4 pairs for the price of 1 pair. Every time they broke down within 3 months and i got a new pair for free
 struct: Usually i buy sketchers 
 struct: for walking
 Astrobytes: Like I have kinda flat feet, so have certain requirements in order to walk comfortably, suitable insoles help with that.
 MSmits: i use those too Astrobytes
 struct: They are light and last me for a decent time
 eulerscheZahl: in the last Kotlin Heroes rounds I coded and Kotlin directly and didn't convert
 MSmits: not flat feet, but no support on the sides, so wobbly i guess
 eulerscheZahl: (might be off topic now, was in another tab)
 MSmits: yeah euler, this is the feet channel now
 MSmits: shooo
 Astrobytes: You've levelled up your Kotlin euler&#160;:)
 Daporan: I get blisters really easily, even with sports shoes
 MSmits: same, but walking shoes should not be worse for this
 MSmits: compared to sports shoes
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't use the more advanced kotlin features. and still look up some syntax when I have to
 Daporan: And a lot of shoes squish your toes together causing foot problems in the long run
 MSmits: that's me in every language
 Astrobytes: Again proper insoles can help with that (the blisters)
 eulerscheZahl: and I buy about 2 paris of soccer shoes per year, they don't last that long unfortunately
 MSmits: well ok, but you're abusing them a lot playing soccer
 MSmits: kicking stuff
 MSmits: like, the ball and if you suck, grass, poles and people
 eulerscheZahl: and my feet are too wide for their length. is it's either a size too small in width when it first the length or comfortable but with space left at the toes
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a bad player. but not THAT bad
 MSmits: ok&#160;:)
 Daporan: what lasts longer usually, the shoes or your shoulder?
 eulerscheZahl: :rolling_eyes:
 Illedan: My shoulder lost to soccer
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't even heard that story Illedan
 MSmits: I must have been playing soccer wrong, i never used my shoulders much
 Astrobytes: Also have the width/length foot/shoe issue euler
 darkhorse64: ankles&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: my shoe recomendation might not be suited for other countries though
 MSmits: do they do flat surfaces differently in your country?
 MSmits: is it non-euclidean?
 Astrobytes: No such thing as flat in Portugal
 eulerscheZahl: does the shoe have Portugal flags all over?
 eulerscheZahl: :tp:
 eulerscheZahl: :pt:
 struct: i mean it probably wont be suitable for your weather conditions
 MSmits: rain?
 struct: rain snow
 struct: I only saw snow when I went to the netherlands
 MSmits: we have it sometimes 
 MSmits: but go to scandinavia for more
 MSmits: I think Germany has places with a lot of snow too, like the mountainous regions
 MSmits: I've been to Schwarzwald
 MSmits: there was snow there...
 Astrobytes: Speaking of Portuguese, I learned a new word today: sonhos 
 eulerscheZahl: is it an insult?
 eulerscheZahl: usually insults are the first that you learn in a new language thanks to the internet
 Astrobytes: No, it means dreams.
 Astrobytes: and (I think) in Portugal some kind of pastry dessert thing
 Astrobytes: I learned the insults many years ago from a kitchen full of Brazilians euler
 eulerscheZahl: i watched Breaking bad and Narcos
 eulerscheZahl: but i find these long plots of 10min+ reading subtitles really annoying
 Astrobytes: That's Spanish though
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care if it's more realistic, i want to understand it without reading all the time
 eulerscheZahl: similar enough. i'm sure that Tobou would understand those insults too
 struct: sonhos used as an insult?
 Astrobytes: noooo
 Astrobytes: re-read
 struct: ah
 Marchete: learn Spanish, ezpz
 struct: Didnt know it was called sonhos
 struct: Here we call it "filhoses"
 struct: sonhos is also right, might depend on the region
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it does I think
 Astrobytes: You have the same ones in Brazil
 Astrobytes: Certain regions of Brazil
 Astrobytes: lol Marchete
 Astrobytes: I'm only really (vaguely) familiar with BR Portuguese though
 SaadToor: did someone finish this Shadows of the Knight?
 SaadToor: episode 1
 Astrobytes: Nobody. Ever.
 MSmits: SaadToor binary search
 SaadToor: but how do i detect where the bomb is?
 MSmits: this is a binary search: Mind the dutch print statements
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/84b94682da">https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/84b94682da</a>
 MSmits: the computer guesses a number between 0 and X and you have to tell it Higher (H) or Lower(L)
 MSmits: and it will keep doing new guesses
 MSmits: this is parallel to jumping in the right direction with batman
 MSmits: you jump in between the minimum and maximum possible target coordinate
 SaadToor: oh, ok
 MSmits: so if the bomb can be between x = 0 and x = 10 you jump to (0+10)/2
 Astrobytes: reducing the search space
 MSmits: same for y coordinate
 SaadToor: ok thanks
 MSmits: dont forget to keep track of batmans new position after you jump
 MSmits: i dont think it gives you in input
 Astrobytes: there are hints in the forum thread for it too if you get stuck SaadToor
 Astrobytes: I can't remember if it does or not MSmits
 SaadToor: oh ok 
 AntiSquid: the batman puzzle should have another part with sidekick robin&#160;!!
 MSmits: KAPOW!
 Hakyoma: Hi guys, do you know at what time the puzzle of the week end?
 struct: not sure
 struct: but since its manually changed i would say it probably will be tomorrow morning
 Hakyoma: Oh ok
 Hakyoma: Time to code baby
 MSmits: sure you can code one. That's one way to procreate
 MSmits: we do NN's here, so that's a start
 Nerchio: CG evolved from MCTS magic to NN magic
 Nerchio: :confounded:
 MSmits: tbh that looks like a toilet distress emoji
 Nerchio: kinda appropriate when we talk about NNs
 Nerchio: isnt it
 MSmits: yeah I guess&#160;:)
 struct: would be sad if we were not improving
 struct: But still its possible to do decent bots with mcts
 struct: at least if you use c++
 MSmits: good bots even. Not all games have been taken over by NN. It's mostly the simple boardgames
 struct: brb
 MSmits: and even then, many boardgames have but 2 or 3 NN's
 Astrobytes: ...and then you have Oware...
 Illedan: :eyes:
 darkhorse64: C4 has already 5 NNs at least
 MSmits: yeah C4 is quite popular and really simple
 MSmits: same as oware
 MSmits: try it on dots and boxes though&#160;:)
 MSmits: well no, dont please :P
 MSmits: just saying it's hard hehe
 Illedan: Just don't try it on FB :P
 MSmits: I think re curse has
 MSmits: not sure if he gave up halfway through or something
 Illedan: think so
 MSmits: i don't think he really failed though, he just had too much else to work on
 Illedan: Yeah, he
 Illedan: 's not the type of person that gives up
 MSmits: nope, he's his own worst enemy in that way
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: I thought noone could be worse than me in this regard, but...
 Illedan: i wish I was more like that
 Illedan: Though my FB obsession these days might be called something
 MSmits: i thought you continuing google contest after the deadline qualified
 Illedan: nah
 Illedan: FB was my first contest. So I have a lot of motivation on getting 1st
 Astrobytes: are you 2nd yet?
 Astrobytes: You kept getting 3rd last I checked
 Illedan: Look at this run&#160;;)
 Illedan: Sooon
 Astrobytes: As long as it's working&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: not speaking about it any more in case I jinx it
 Illedan: Jinxed&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I'll stfu next time&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: back to tennis I go...
 SandmanSW96: hey all, i saw the new feature in the IDE,
 SandmanSW96: if anyone is around lol
 AllYourTrees: whats the new feature
 SandmanSW96: where it adds a line with "x References | x References"
 SandmanSW96: right above a name of a variable, method, etc
 AllYourTrees: oh what language?
 SandmanSW96: c#
 AllYourTrees: nice!
 SandmanSW96: lol screw that i wanna switch it off
 SandmanSW96: it pops them up on their own,
 SandmanSW96: and it takes up a whole line in the IDE of space, really screws me up
 SandmanSW96: plus i clicked it and it doesnt do anything anyways
 Astrobytes: Try ignoring it
 SandmanSW96: kinda hard to ignore it when it randomly adds and deletes whole empty lines right in the middle of my code
 Astrobytes: what? Never had that
 SandmanSW96: just to put the little "0 references" 'link' that does nothing
 Astrobytes: If you can provide an example, post it in Bug Report on discord or make a forum post
 SandmanSW96: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/wh32MKh">https://ibb.co/wh32MKh</a>
 SandmanSW96: its not a bug i just wanna turn the damn thing off.  soon as i type in a new variable name it adds that extra line automatically and it drives me up the damn wall
 Astrobytes: You can't disable it. You're gonna have to live with it or use an external editor
 Astrobytes: I mean, it's a pretty minor annoyance
 SandmanSW96: yeah just when it makes my code jump up and down
 SandmanSW96: if not oh well i'll live with it
 Astrobytes: Code in your preferred editor, copy paste into CG IDE, win
 Astrobytes: Or use one of the sync tools
 SandmanSW96: nah i use the IDE here, the ctrl-enter and their particular puzzle etc.  thats worth staying here for over that little bugger
 SandmanSW96: thats not much of a win either cause i have yet to see it retain the tabs etc the same way
 Astrobytes: Fair. I use CG IDE for (most) puzzles, multis I use VS
 Astrobytes: hm, what's your usual IDE?
 Astrobytes: You can configure the CG IDE to some extent, tabs, spaces etc
 SandmanSW96: nothing special for external
 SandmanSW96: its all good.  was just wondering if I could shut the stupid thing off
 SandmanSW96: thx
 Astrobytes: Unfortunately yer stuck with it!
 Astrobytes: No probs
 Illedan: :dance:
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes:&#160;::no_mouth:
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: I guess it might fall below 2nd. Just never been 2nd during submit before
 Astrobytes: What you tweaking?
 Illedan: Everything
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Now that just smells like desperation :P
 Illedan: Ofc
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Samzok123: hi
 Illedan: Problem now is that I'm close at beating reCurse, so I can't settle with this
 Astrobytes: Naturally. But all gains are good gains.
 Astrobytes: :no_mouth: but&#160;:+1:

 Astrobytes: Do me proud. If Medvedev wins the tennis and you get your good placement it's a win for me
 Astrobytes: Oof. That was beastly!
 darkhorse64: Wow! Using accio to catapult a snaffle with another snaffle
 darkhorse64: gn all
 Astrobytes: gn man, take it easy
 Astrobytes: Well Medvedev won the tennis, your turn Illedan :D
 Illedan: :P
 Astrobytes: You've done some nice damage points-wise
 Illedan: Yeah, they were around 42 some days ago :P
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Illedan: Ended in crash and burn&#160;:( 
 Astrobytes: No matter, it still looked like an improvement
 Astrobytes: tweak something else and leave the last tweak alon
 Astrobytes: e
 Astrobytes: #spam4life
 Allison: bad spammer, Astro! :O 
 Allison: I feel dumb.  Just starring at this puzzle makes me feel dumb.&#160;:&lt; 
 Allison: So does misspelling starting.&#160;: |  Makes me feel even more dumb.
 Allison: staring*  omg I quit with words today.
 JustinZhang: the easy puzzle is hard

 JustinZhang: could somebody join my clash?
 JustinZhang: plz
 JustinZhang: Husoski won
 JustinZhang: I think i should learn more about string
 Husoski: If it's in Python or Java, there are good tutorial/practice problems at codingbat.com
 JustinZhang: this is the first time i know that when I refresh the page all of my chat will disappear
 Wontonimo: what are you working on JustinZhang&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: it means we don't have chat history in CG
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hi Wontonimo, when iteragrate solver into MCTS, do we need to remove UCT formular?
 Wontonimo: hey Miyam!  keep the UCB formula.
 Wontonimo: the UCB is still used for selection when a solution hasn't been found
 Wontonimo: when a solution has been found, UCB is skipped
 Wontonimo: and just backprop the solution
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank you&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: how are you implementing keeping track of solved?  I use +/- infinity, and some people use a whole other variable
 MiyamuraIzumi: I have problem when itergare solver
 MiyamuraIzumi: so not finish yet
 Wontonimo: ah.
 MiyamuraIzumi: actually,
 MiyamuraIzumi: I will use a flag, so a whole variable
 Wontonimo: starting with just vanilla mcts, what changes are you making?
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I add a status variable to a node
 Wontonimo: how have you changed the 4 core functions&#160;: select, expand, rollout, backprop?
 ProCoder03: Good Morning&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: hey ProCoder03&#160;!
 ProCoder03: Hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: what are you working on?
 ProCoder03: sorry!! was afk..
 ProCoder03: I am working on Scrabble
 Wontonimo: i don't even remember completing this
 Wontonimo: oh, i remember now that i'm looking at my code
 ProCoder03: Got it to work:smiley:
 Wontonimo: +1
 ProCoder03: Next one target, is Mayan Calculation
 ProCoder03: It seems I have already started it :astonished:
 Wontonimo: that one was pretty fun
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: :wave: :wave:
 struct: are you working on anything Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: i've been "thinking" about stuff though
 struct: hmm
 struct: what kind of stuff
 Wontonimo: making multis.  the physics ones i've told you about
 Wontonimo: rag doll boxing
 struct: Ah nice
 Wontonimo: using verlet physics
 struct: JUst remember that sdk has some limitations
 ProCoder03: what heck of physics is it&#160;??
 Wontonimo: in verlet physics, you only model points and lines
 Wontonimo: points have mass, momentum, velocity
 Wontonimo: lines connect points and maintain constraints of distance using a dampened elastic force
 Wontonimo: and that's it
 ProCoder03: :scream: I am dumb stricken now...
 ProCoder03: why do you guys do such hard multis&#160;??
 Wontonimo: what would you suggest as a multi?
 ProCoder03: Something which is less of physics that this....
 struct: There are a few "easy" multis
 ProCoder03: Those are for u guys,
 struct: Also it can be easy to code but hard to progress 
 struct: games like connect 4 should not be extremely hard
 ProCoder03: I am still stuck in wood in most...
 struct: its fine
 ProCoder03: And I suck at writing simulators..
 ProCoder03: so C4 is kinda tough for me...
 struct: I see
 ProCoder03: I have written one sim, TTT for wood 1
 ProCoder03: that too very sub optimal..
 ProCoder03: using 8 if else...
 Wontonimo: i find coding a simulator the most tedious part.  if i already had a good simulator for all the multis, i'd probably have a submission for them all
 struct: simulator is the most enjoyable part for me
 struct: But thats because I end up trying to optimize it
 struct: Then Im stuck in that loop for the rest of the contest 
 ProCoder03: How do you guys do it&#160;?? I start writing a sim and I just get stuck after doing 2 or 3 simulation method
 struct: depends on the game
 struct: also on the algorithm
 ProCoder03: I tried for CvZ like 2 months ago..
 struct: Did you finish the sim?
 ProCoder03: I wrote for Zombie and Zombie point system... 
 ProCoder03: then got stuck what to do 
 struct: I did random search
 struct: so I play the game until the end and check the score
 struct: if its better than the best score I keep that solution 
 ProCoder03: Even That needs a sim right&#160;??
 struct: yes
 struct: I only do sims
 struct: Probably fb is the only one i do if else
 struct: might be a few more but i haven tried a lot of games
 ProCoder03: Ohh.... Cool...
 Wontonimo: my space shooter isn't a sim
 ProCoder03: You have told me...
 Wontonimo: but yes, generally sim is the way to go
 ProCoder03: Ikt, But how to write a sim without getting stuck... 
 ProCoder03: That's my problem..
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: my wife just saw a mouse in the house&#160;:( 
 struct: o.o
 struct: burn it
 Wontonimo: i used to have a cat for these problems
 Wontonimo: my dog doesn't care
 ProCoder03: Buy a cat then
 struct: Do cats really hunt them?
 struct: I never had a cat so idk
 Wontonimo: depends on the cat.  a farm cat is worth 1000 mouse traps per week
 Wontonimo: a show cat that isn't let outside and was raised in a basement by a breeder ... useless
 Wontonimo: i may borrow a neighbours cat
 struct: lol
 struct: Is that a thing?
 struct: borrowing neighbors cats
 Wontonimo: i'll make it a thing
 struct: :D
 Wontonimo: cuz i sure don't want to buy one
 Wontonimo: don't get me wrong, i loved my last three cats.  i'm just trying to downsize the zoo we have here.
 Wontonimo: and uninvited new animal as of today
 struct: never had to hunt rats
 Wontonimo: mice (hopefully not rats)
 Wontonimo: hopefully just 1 mouse and not mice
 struct: and hopefully not pregnant 
 Wontonimo: oh, thanks.  i didn't think of that 
 struct: lol
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: im messing with you Wontonimo
 struct: sorry&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: it's all good
 struct: im sure it will be fine
 Wontonimo: it's not the first time.  won't be the last.  i do live very close to a lot of wilderness, so it is expected
 struct: it seems china has over 2 billion rats
 struct: you will be fine
 Westicles: custom game of life
 Westicles: potw
 struct: seems easy enough
 struct: ill try it tomorrow
 Wontonimo: nearly midnight.  gn all
 struct: gn

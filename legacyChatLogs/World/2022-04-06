 Darleanow: Hello guys, any idea of simple program to generate added variable names
 Darleanow: for exemple, i have n variables to make, and will create n variale with a different name
 Trunksistor: It strongly depends from your prog lang... but would not be better to have an array / list?
 Darleanow: python&#160;:)
 Darleanow: no, i need variables, to store a X value
 Darleanow: for ex var1=1x
 Darleanow: var2=2x
 Darleanow: until n
 Trunksistor: Well, I strongly suggest you to change your strategy, it easily may be wrong...BUT, if you want to try for the sake of knowledge, who am I to block you?I'll put here a possibility, let me just check one thing
 Darleanow: i got something
 Darleanow: for i in range(0, 9): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e23c98b9-6c22-4180-a261-d60f38f7ff51">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e23c98b9-6c22-4180-a261-d60f38f7ff51</a>

 Wontonimo: use a dictionary
 Darleanow: its for this game, i'm going to evaluate distance between all of factories to take the closest ones
 Trunksistor: Ok, in general yes you can go with it. But Wontonimo is right
 Trunksistor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fb69ab77-62d7-473a-9dbc-0813541819a9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fb69ab77-62d7-473a-9dbc-0813541819a9</a>
 Darleanow: its coded hardly
 Darleanow: i don't want to do this way 
 Darleanow: this is the point
 Wontonimo: "coded hardly"?
 Trunksistor: but you can generate the key of the dictionary
 Trunksistor: like you would generate the name of the variables
 Darleanow: yes wonto, i mean by this, the french expression "coder en dur"
 Darleanow: i'll try my idea, if it doesn't works i'll get to now about dicts&#160;:)
 Trunksistor: hardcoded, same thing. The point is that you can use whatever key for your dictionary
 Darleanow: :point_up_2:
 Wontonimo: you can do it like this
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1af384c9-5bfa-4833-a4d8-6da54c64a606">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1af384c9-5bfa-4833-a4d8-6da54c64a606</a>

 Darleanow: almost
 Trunksistor: Then, that is a dictionary :wink:
 Darleanow: :o
 Darleanow: this is&#160;?for i in range(0, 9):
 Wontonimo: ^^ that won't work
 Darleanow: why&#160;?:'(

 Wontonimo: it's so ....wrong... though *shiver*
 Darleanow: HEHEHEHE WONTO
 Darleanow: i'm the next wonto 
 Trunksistor: It's working, but it's a dangerous path xD
 Darleanow: i've always been a sith anyways
 Wontonimo: why on gods green earth would you want to commit such an atrocity&#160;?
 Darleanow: you should already know as time goes by that i have mental issues
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 Trunksistor: I think you should have a Sith Lord to teach you the path :grin:
 Darleanow: i have no master, only pain is.
 Darleanow: am i acting like a sith good enough&#160;?
 Wontonimo: in all seriously though, don't do the globals()[ ... ] thing.  really, it's really bad programming practice
 Wontonimo: "in all seriousness"*\
 Darleanow: why are globals vars bad&#160;?
 Darleanow: if they have a really specific name, i should not be having problems right&#160;?
 Wontonimo: no, using globals()[...] to make new vaiables is yuck.  use an array or a dictionary
 Darleanow: i don't know, i'm open to ideas
 Darleanow: okay so should i gen a dict, with first to distance from 1-2 as 12 and value as 6 for ex&#160;?
 Wontonimo: if you want a global do it like this

 Darleanow: i already did the 18 firsts
 Wontonimo: and a python helper book or common programming patterns <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf">http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf</a> 
 Darleanow: and half of the right pan
 Darleanow: pannel*
 Wontonimo: cool.  Check out this python game for some insight into using variables and dictionaries dynamically <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR">https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR</a>
 Trunksistor: Yes, but try to figure out how to improve yourself. Those link from Wontonimo are gold!
 Wontonimo: you may have to copy the code from the last link and run it locally.  The tech.io interactive mode seems to be having issues
 Darleanow: Thanks Wonto&#160;!
 Darleanow: yeah i tred the tech.io game it looks really cool&#160;!
 Wontonimo: play around with the variables in it.  see if you can make it so that there is a  secret message per room that is shown only the second time someone enters the room.
 Darleanow: i'll save this in my notebook, i'll do it&#160;!!!
 Darleanow: and i'll get back to you once i did it&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: the secret message should be stored in the same data structure as the room data.
 Wontonimo: cool cool
 Wontonimo: have fun!
 Darleanow: thanks, you too&#160;!!!

 justhalf: I'm wondering what kind of methods people use in the Thor codegolf puzzle. I saw people with as low as under 70 bytes. Meanwhile I'm stuck at 118 with no obvious way to reduce it further. So I assume this could come from a completely different way to approach the problem.
 justhalf: (context: Python 3)
 Darleanow: justhalf, a quick tip that made me discover a lot of things, is the python book
 Darleanow: for example, ik that you know way more than me
 Passifi: there is this thing that outputs your code as some weridly format utf 16 gibberish and that saves a lot of space
 Darleanow: but lambda funct are way more short than funct etc
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a> 
 Passifi: there it is
 Passifi: I think this is a quiet well known open secret so if the code seems impossible short they might have used this
 Darleanow: THIS IS GENIUS
 Darleanow: exec(bytes('牰湩⡴栢汥潬眠牯摬∡ ','u16')[2:])
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Darleanow that looks like python golf compression.  It's legit, and acceptable to use.  You may be interested in this tool <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 Darleanow: i will win all my clash of codes mouahahhahaa
 timbersson: lol thanks passifi, that just took my code for that puzzle from 135 to 93 :smile:
 Shrimpster: yeah almost everyone knows it apparently Darleanow so... goodluck :D 
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 Darleanow: imma go back in time to remove the idea from the head of the creator
 Darleanow: and make it for myself
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 justhalf: Lol, that's a cool trick for static puzzles, haha
 Darleanow: oh, justhalf, i've seen that you're interested in nlp, which language are you using to deal with it&#160;?
 justhalf: Most industry standards use Python, since there are many libraries there already
 Darleanow: yeah i've seen about spacy and nlp
 Darleanow: nltk*
 Darleanow: i had a question about it
 justhalf: Ask away
 Darleanow: it's quite hard to explain it in english as it's not my main language, but i'll try; I'm trying to develop a sort of ai which would process language, i mean understand it
 justhalf: Yes, that's the general goal of NLP
 Darleanow: indeed
 Darleanow: i can get the function of the words in a sentence
 Darleanow: using spacy
 Darleanow: ITS SO HARD TO EXPLAIN
 justhalf: Function, as in part of speech? Or dependency parser?
 Darleanow: i mean the role of each word in a sentence
 justhalf: What are some examples of roles
 Darleanow: do&#160;: verb
 justhalf: Ah, ok, you mean part of speech
 Darleanow: indeed
 Darleanow: but for example when i'm telling it sentences like I like apples, i need to make it able to identify that when it's an input, and ther's an I it's me
 Darleanow: but if it says I, it's not going to be me obv
 Darleanow: and process all of this in sql queries to store data 
 Darleanow: for example i'm saying i like apples
 Darleanow: i'd like to make it able to query a sql table named Darleanow
 Darleanow: in which apples is something that i like, and when i ask What do i like, it would tell me that i like apple
 Darleanow: apples*
 justhalf: You're building Knowledge base
 Darleanow: exactly
 Darleanow: and i would also like to build an entire emotionnal system, which is affected by randomness, but also by other factors, for example if it likes rainy days and its raining, hapiness would go up
 Passifi: some of the difficulties of these puzzles are just a bit skewed I've been working on Battle Tower for hours and still no success but war i finished in one session and the later gives you more exp :upside_down:
 Darleanow: and the whole emotional system would affect the way it answers me
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: doomed from the start
 Automaton2000: you need to learn it
 NewCoder09: Hello
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Uljahn why was csb renamed .-.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not Uljahn but may I answer too?
 Husoski: ...only if you get permission to ask first.&#160;:)
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: sure euler 
 eulerscheZahl: possible copyright infringements, "The Empire strikes back"
 eulerscheZahl: CG renamed a lot of their games recently
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII dislikes the new names</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: same
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ya I was thinking copyright but I wasnt completely sure
 Wontonimo: i think we can all agree
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: hiiii Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hi MaliciouslyCrypticUsername :wave: :wave:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Hav a taco :taco:
 Wontonimo: thanks
 inoryy: but has anybody considered risks of MK suing for the obvious copyright infringement in the new name?
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: our school blocked replit on their computers .-.
 eulerscheZahl: that makes absolutely no sense to me
 eulerscheZahl: students could learn coding there, bad?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Well some ppl were using it as a proxy to get past the content filter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the Mad one funnelled alot of users into CSB
 Wontonimo: is there any multi that is easier to get to gold than CSB?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Probably not
 eulerscheZahl: when you don't know the -3v, it's not that easy actually
 Wontonimo: *if you are given the 1 line trick
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: euler everyone knows it tho
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: AutomatonNN hi
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ._.
 Wontonimo: nope, i help a few people a month learn it
 eulerscheZahl: i reversed the physics (not the collisions, but the friction and max turn angle)
 eulerscheZahl: wrote a monte carlo to reach gold. and then it was part of the statement
 eulerscheZahl: i was pretty pissed
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: where did AutomatonNN go?
 eulerscheZahl: got the covid virus and died
 Wontonimo: because you missed it in the statement, or was the statement updated after you did the work eulerscheZahl
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ioof
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: oof*
 eulerscheZahl: no more pings for me, i don't miss automaton
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl &lt;3s Automatons
 eulerscheZahl: the friction+turn angle were (are?) not part of the statement below gold
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: that would be piss inducing 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I dove into the math and ran sims...beyond using -3v ... the floating math kills cycles, better to use that time for more searches
 PatrickMcGinnisII: having said that, my CSB still sucked
 inoryy: -pi*v better
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Did csb change recently? Apart from the name
 PatrickMcGinnisII: +/- .1 dependent on speed did work, but every conditional reduced depth
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: cus my code is being funkyt
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: funky*
 eulerscheZahl: 75ms/turn instead of 150. but that's been years ago
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: huh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i wrote 659 lines of code for Block the Fire ... more than half is commented out, smh.  I should start over now that the experimenting is kinda over
 hyphz: The PotW is getting on my nerves.. is the cat cheating and getting its paws wet on the surround moves?
 Wontonimo: nope
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My cats, even the blind one, would win everytime
 Wontonimo: hey MaliciouslyCrypticUsername , your CSB pods are not doing and drift correction (-3v or otherwise)
 Wontonimo: and your lookahead for drifting is too aggressive and needs to be made a little more conservative
 Wontonimo: it looks like your bots are going to do an amazing drift past a checkpoint but then miss it by pixels and have to loop back.

 Neralem: Sadly not. Can only see pending ones
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well that's annoying
 Neralem: Got help, thanks&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 Neralem: Anyone else getting the message "Network error&#160;: status -1" when trying to run a test in the IDE? Can't run any testcases really
 PatrickMcGinnisII: What did you break?
 Neralem: It wan't me&#160;:( .... i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I usually only get that when my internet goes down
 Husoski: This might be a good time to restart your browser
 Neralem: even tried a different browser. Same
 Neralem: suddenly works again
 Husoski: Sometimes that happens when a cow flies by.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The BSI inserted a Kasperky virus
 a-Rye: Or when the hamster falls off the wheel 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cat did a dance on CG keyboard
 Westicles: hmm, the french poked a hole in my clash
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Westicles, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 16 tacos
 Smelty: o-o
 hyphz: Oh, no, it's the sodding mouse spiralling inwards instead of circling because of rounding error on the pixels.
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':taco:' was defined as ' A currency to some, sustenance for others '
 Synergyforge: Dead chat

 ycsvenom: Automaton
 ycsvenom: Automaton200
 ycsvenom: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i should probably look at performance on a more macro level as well
 ycsvenom: i hate shortest
 Astrobytes: What was the 'issue' people had with Block The Spreading Fire optim?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Astrobytes, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 32 tacos
 Smelty: can i get a taco antiwonto
 Smelty: automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why do you think is important
 potatok: i give up
 Simlas1337: yes give up its isnt worth it
 Westicles: Astrobytes, I think they didn't like it has a random validator
 Simlas1337: btw i dont understand why easy puzzles are hard to optimize in order to receive 100%
 Astrobytes: Westicles, lol not the end of the world is it
 Astrobytes: Simlas1337: often it's a case of complexity reduction, nothing crazy
 Astrobytes: *time complexity
 Westicles: yeah, and I think it was a misunderstanding, looks like it was generated randomly but doesn't change
 Westicles: anyhow, they are mad at me now instead
 Astrobytes: looks alright, might give it a go
 Astrobytes: What have you done or not done now? :D
 Westicles: ruined their day with this

 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Don't ever change 
 Westicles: ha, well this time my intentions were good.  I didn't realize the tests would all fail if it got approved 
 Astrobytes: It's interesting enough, wonder if they'll pick up on it
 Astrobytes: anyway, gotta run, catch you later
 Simlas1337: Did somebody make mime type for 100%? I'm just curious how to optimilize this
 Westicles: bye Astro
 Sarstan: Weird. Got the Escaping the cat puzzle solved. Then submit and it fails the latter 3. For some reason my mouse is turning around when it shouldn't.
 ASM_MOV_INT: My mouse moves so slow, it only escapes the first test.... I'm heading exactly opposite of where the cat is, so there's no further point to run away to
 Sarstan: My deal is I got tired of trying to setup the trig, so I decided to try making the cat go back and forth as long as I could before rushing the edge.
 ASM_MOV_INT: then again, i just recovered from heading the mouse directly to the cat!
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 Sarstan: Which worked for me!
 Sarstan: Until the validators.
 ASM_MOV_INT: i bet you have to do some fancy calculations to figure just the perfect direction to avoid the super fast cat....
 ASM_MOV_INT: move just enough to keep the cat going the direction it's going, yet move closer to the border
 Sarstan: Yeah, without giving away too much, I essentially get to the center and then when the cat moves one direction, the mouse moves the opposite until the cat catches up, then move the other direction and so on.
 Sarstan: To a certain point where I have it make a break for it.
 ASM_MOV_INT: i use atan to figure where the cat is on the circle, then cos and sin to figure the point to aim the mouse
 Synergyforge: Yeesh.  Math is hard.
 Sarstan: That's what I tried at first until I kept having issues with going from positive to negative values.
 Sarstan: I know there's a way to handle it, but I'm lazy right now.
 ASM_MOV_INT: yeah, my mouse bounces back and forth and doesn't get far
 ASM_MOV_INT: same
 ASM_MOV_INT: the clash of code&#160;!
 Sarstan: There we go! I had a stupid mistake in my code. An OR statement that needed to check the same statement from the other side that I didn't include.
 Sarstan: Alright, now that that's done, I should probably try to solve it as intended in the near future, lol.
 Kaelidian: I can't get TID to work right on Game Of Drones
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Kaelidian, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 PatrykJagielski: tak taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey PatrykJagielski, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 love_0_0: is anyone still breathing?
 RandomSteve: YO GUYS I JUST COMPLETED MY FIRTS CLASH OF CODE 100% LET'S GO
 RandomSteve: yeah I'm breathing
 RandomSteve: wbu?
 Wontonimo: congrats
 RandomSteve: boy I've been trying with several clashes of code and with each one I learned more but couldn't solve any till now
 Wontonimo: that's a milestone for sure
 RandomSteve: thank you
 RandomSteve: oh yeah it is
 Wontonimo: what language are you practicing?
 RandomSteve: Java
 Wontonimo: nice, i did java for a long time.  i liked it a lot
 RandomSteve: I am pretty new to programming
 RandomSteve: so you changed? why? you found a better language?
 Wontonimo: well it is pretty cool that you kept at it!  Most people have a really hard time getting over that initial hump
 RandomSteve: thank you well this community in codingame is really cool and helpful and nobody is discouraging
 Wontonimo: no, i changed because work changed.  I started at a new place that needed me to learn PHP
 RandomSteve: oh I see so they worked with a different language and you had to change
 Wontonimo: yeah, then after that it was Javascript.  Now I'm onto Python.
 RandomSteve: wow you're like a polygloth
 Wontonimo: I miss the strict types of java and the old javadoc 
 RandomSteve: that's cool
 Wontonimo: :grin: thanks
 RandomSteve: nostalgia??
 RandomSteve: np
 Wontonimo: what attracted you to programming?
 PatrykJagielski: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 Wontonimo: :taco: RandomSteve
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded RandomSteve 1 tacos. RandomSteve now has 1 taco. Wontonimo now has 31 taco
 PatrykJagielski: whats time in Canada?
 RandomSteve: so sorry I had to go afk for a second
 RandomSteve: thanks for the taco lol
 RandomSteve: ummm
 Wontonimo: Canada is huge.  The second largest country in the world.  There are lots of time zones here
 Wontonimo: for me it is 11:34pm
 RandomSteve: I guess the fact that you can do theorically anything with programming, from games to webpages or apps etc. And a youtuber that I watch  recently codes minecraft mods so I guess seeing that I could code a webpage or a mod or an app or a game or anything I want is pretty interesting to me
 RandomSteve: I feel like a kid saying minecraft mods but I'm actually 20 lol
 RandomSteve: well I guess at heart I'm 5 years old anywau
 RandomSteve: *anyway
 RandomSteve: it is 10:36 pm here
 Wontonimo: hey, I tried my hand at minecraft mods when my kids were 11 and 12.  It was fun
 Wontonimo: heck, I still play once in a while.  why not?  it's fun
 RandomSteve: yeah I guess you're right. I like being a creative person and java and minecraft hold a creative aura adn I really like that
 Wontonimo: have you done any of the puzzles RandomSteve&#160;?  Like "The Descent"&#160;?
 RandomSteve: dude you're a pro you're top 0.1% on this page and still stop to congrat a complete noob like me wow thank you
 RandomSteve: uhmm
 RandomSteve: I tried the mouse scape event
 RandomSteve: Escaoing the cat
 Wontonimo: that one is tricky
 Wontonimo: how about this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 RandomSteve: boy I spent like two hours and I passed level one and that's it
 a-Rye: Minecraft is awesome! But if you want to develop mods for it, disable the logging that's associated with the log4j vulnerability
 RandomSteve: oh wait I remember this
 Wontonimo: here are the other intro puzzles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures</a>
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1</a>
 RandomSteve: I tried this the other day but I felt like I didn't know enough maybe I could give it another shot
 Wontonimo: which one?
 RandomSteve: the descent
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: want some help?
 Wontonimo:  I won't solve it for you but i'll give you hints
 RandomSteve: Oh that would be amazing honestly
 Wontonimo: okay, so go into it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent</a>
 RandomSteve: I have been watching some tutorials but I am still a bit confused
 RandomSteve: ok done
 Wontonimo: and look at the default code.
 RandomSteve: ok
 RandomSteve: uhmm
 Wontonimo: do you know how to load the default code if you want it again?
 RandomSteve: no not really
 Wontonimo: it's the arrow in the top right.  looks like a circle
 RandomSteve: oh I see it
 RandomSteve: ok cool
 Wontonimo: okay, run the first ttest case using the default code
 Wontonimo: it will just always shoot mountain 4
 RandomSteve: it does
 Wontonimo: which is wrong, but let's solve it
 RandomSteve: ok
 Wontonimo: the objective is to shoot the highest mountain each pass
 Wontonimo: lines 11-12-13 read in the remaining height of each mountain
 RandomSteve: ok I understand
 Wontonimo: line 12 specifically gets the mountain height
 Wontonimo: and "i" is the index of tthe mountain
 RandomSteve: wait lines 11-12-13 are just comments
 Wontonimo: oh sorry ... just a sec
 Wontonimo: 19-21
 Wontonimo: i deleted some comments above
 RandomSteve: oh ok
 Wontonimo: line 18-27 are your main game loop
 Wontonimo: that section of code is run every round.  you get 1 shot per round
 Wontonimo: so, how would you find the mountain with the largest height out of the 8 mountains&#160;?
 RandomSteve: uhmm
 RandomSteve: ok give me a second to think
 Wontonimo: you can add code, just like you can in clash of code
 RandomSteve: so I know mountain one in this case is the highest one
 Wontonimo: mountain 0 actually, but yeah
 RandomSteve: but I am not sure how to tell the program to identify the highest one
 RandomSteve: ok mountain 0 you're right
 Wontonimo: okay, what if we declare 2 more variables at the start of main
 Wontonimo: int highest_height = 0;int highest_mountain_i = 0;
 Wontonimo: and right after int mountainH = in.nextInt();
 RandomSteve: you mean the main loop?
 Wontonimo: we check and update those variables
 RandomSteve: sorry for being a noob
 Wontonimo: np
 RandomSteve: so I would add that in the while block
 Wontonimo: let's put those variables right after public static void main(String args[]) {
 RandomSteve: oh ok
 Wontonimo: oh no, you are right, 
 Wontonimo: right after the while(true)
 Wontonimo: sorry
 RandomSteve: yeah I feel like it wouldn't link both things and confuse the program it has happened to me sometimes
 RandomSteve: so the line with the for loop  with the variable i is between theint highest_height = 0;
 Wontonimo: This is where I'd suggest putting them
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0f59c619-c3e1-4a0c-99ef-4890e70cf09f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0f59c619-c3e1-4a0c-99ef-4890e70cf09f</a>
 RandomSteve: ok so that is exactly where they are
 RandomSteve: so
 Wontonimo: cool, now you can add some logic after int mountainH = in.nextInt();
 RandomSteve: uhm
 Wontonimo: to check if mountainH is larger than the highest height
 Wontonimo: and if it is, then update the highest height and the i
 Wontonimo: take your time
 RandomSteve: ok
 RandomSteve: so
 RandomSteve: let me see
 RandomSteve: ok so I got this
 RandomSteve: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9e096e8c-4e09-4161-a6bc-1558b1a0e0f8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9e096e8c-4e09-4161-a6bc-1558b1a0e0f8</a>
 Wontonimo: getting there , but not quite
 RandomSteve: but I am don't really know how to update the i and now I am ignoring the int highest mountain which I wanted tto print
 Wontonimo: highest_height = 8;sets it to 8, but you want to set it to mountainH
 Wontonimo: like this
 Wontonimo: highest_height = mountainH
 Wontonimo: and then right after that save the i into the variable highest_mountain_i
 Wontonimo: I'm describing in words what to do so you can code it.  if i just send youu the code...  it'll spoil it
 RandomSteve: it's ok I think that's the right way to lern
 RandomSteve: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5e0b98c-d30d-462c-9375-9335918657ce">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5e0b98c-d30d-462c-9375-9335918657ce</a>
 RandomSteve: ok so I tought a lot I came up with that
 Wontonimo: very close.
 RandomSteve: I think it0's backwrds tho
 Wontonimo: use highest_mountain_i = i&#160;;instead
 RandomSteve: oh it is backwards lol ok
 Wontonimo: then at the end change the println statement to System.out.println(highest_mountain_i);
 Kaelidian: You doing the mars lander?
 Kaelidian: Just maintain your height until you're over the landing zone
 RandomSteve: I feel like that should be it but I think I made a sintax error somewhere
 RandomSteve: uhmm I am doind the descent tho
 Wontonimo: i sent you a DM RandomSteve
 Wontonimo: gotta go
 RandomSteve: ok thank you so much
 Kaelidian: just set a bool check to determine if you're over the landing pad when you are start your decent
 Kaelidian: if not, you gonna smash the last one when its all the way up
 RandomSteve: wait I think I made it
 RandomSteve: but it's not mars lander it's the descent
 Kaelidian: oh, dont think I've done that one
 RandomSteve: I think this exercise makes me understand better how to use for i loops
 RandomSteve: wow
 RandomSteve: This is like the second ever problem I solve at this page

 PhantomzBack: hoi
 WaterCooledStopwatchMachine_daff: hi
 Alshock: hellow
 stanleyjames: whatsup
 Papaver: Hello
 NexTronick: anyone doing the Power of Thor -episode 1?
 NexTronick: or am i too noob and find it scarry ahhaa
 Passifi: What are you struggling with specificly&#160;? 
 NexTronick: I am not use if i get the question
 NexTronick: for example if the thor is at (3,8) and i move thor to S then will it be (3,9)?
 NexTronick: (x,y)?
 Passifi: well yes S means the y value gets incremented by 1
 NexTronick: n mean -1?
 NexTronick: N mean -1?
 Passifi: yes
 Passifi: W is x -1 E is x+1
 Ngochung_02: Hello
 Passifi: with that it should be solvable&#160;:)
 NexTronick: oh thank you Passifi
 3ataja: am i the only one whose Esc key not working in the vim edit mode??
 3ataja: it says normal mode but every key i hit gets inserted
 Z0ltan892: Hello
 blinkyu: Yeah vim mode is not working for me either
 Wontonimo: Most CG puzzles have a coordinate system such that (0,0) is the top left, positive X goes to the right, and positive Y goes down.  It's actually a CG general rule
 Wontonimo: That makes (0,0) on a map the North West corner.  East is +X, and South is +Y
 Simann: hey! is there a c++ square root function?
 darkhorse64: sqrt
 Simann: oh yea wtf
 Simann: it doesnt work
 JamesModifiedGames: lol
 Simann: well whatever
 darkhorse64: it does #include &lt;cmath&gt;
 Simann: oh... yea i forgot includes ty
 AnonymousCodess: im new to codeing
 AnonymousCodess: its fun but kinda hard
 JamesModifiedGames: I understand that AninymousCodes
 AnonymousCodess: idk what to do for this code
 jacek: AutomatoNN what to do? what to do?
 jacek: &gt;&lt;
 Simann: lol then go to something simpler and then try what you are doing again later
 JamesModifiedGames: Go to the practice, If you know basic javascript, you should be able to get a jist of what to do.
 AnonymousCodess: the thing is i just started today
 AnonymousCodess: so thats why
 Simann: :joy: 
 AnonymousCodess: what there is a first time for everything
 Simann: one more reason to go go do more basic stuff
 AnonymousCodess: thats what im gonna do
 AnonymousCodess: im surprized this is free
 JamesModifiedGames: Well here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming</a>
 JamesModifiedGames: Use this to learn what to do 
 JLukeSkywalker: ew
 AnonymousCodess: no i like it free
 AnonymousCodess: i use dis
 JamesModifiedGames: Khan academy is free
 AnonymousCodess: ...
 JLukeSkywalker: but gross
 AnonymousCodess: imma use this one
 JamesModifiedGames: What khan
 JamesModifiedGames: luke
 JLukeSkywalker: coming from someone who teaches programming, find a cool, simple coding project you think is fun, pick a language, and code it. Use lots of google
 JLukeSkywalker: so much better than a course
 JamesModifiedGames: Hey, it worked for me lol. Or if anything anonymousCodes, go to codecombat.com, that uses java script and python mainly but it stiil teaches the basic with games.
 Simann: I agree with that JLuke
 JamesModifiedGames: True
 JamesModifiedGames: I learn better from courses, that's just me then.
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, there are definitely people on both sides 
 JamesModifiedGames: Agreed.
 JLukeSkywalker: personally I was never able to learn coding from a course
 Simann: making either external or internal game hacks and mods is a very good practise
 JLukeSkywalker: teach my courses fully project based other than things like variables and basic i/o
 WelloHorld: HELLO MODS
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^ good name
 WelloHorld: lol :joy:
 MasterCoderxD: i just wrote my own programming language :grinning:
 JLukeSkywalker: mice! what is unique about it? and what is the goal of using it?
 MasterCoderxD: It's basically for mathematical use
 MasterCoderxD: it has BASIC syntax
 MasterCoderxD: It's hella fast
 JLukeSkywalker: compiled?
 MasterCoderxD: yeah
 JLukeSkywalker: what did you write the compiler in?
 JamesModifiedGames: This is the most active the chat has been since I have been on here. lol
 MasterCoderxD: C
 JamesModifiedGames: Really*
 MasterCoderxD: thanks James
 JLukeSkywalker: nice, i did something similar with c a while back for the repl.it language challenge
 JamesModifiedGames: No problem
 Astrobytes: JamesModifiedGames: it's usually a little more active, I for one have been taking a little break recently.
 JLukeSkywalker: wasnt a math language though
 JamesModifiedGames: Ahhhh, makes sense
 MasterCoderxD: ohkkk
 MasterCoderxD: I am only 16 btw
 MasterCoderxD: :joy:
 JamesModifiedGames: I'm going to take a educated guess and say that your text is pink becuse of you being a mod. just like discord?
 MasterCoderxD: mine?
 JLukeSkywalker: its great that you are using lower level languages like c, thats how I started out
 Astrobytes: No, if you tag anyone by name it shows up red for you JamesModifiedGames
 JamesModifiedGames: Don't make me feel bad. I'm 17 and can barely do a loop 
 JLukeSkywalker: astros was red/pink bc he did urName:
 Astrobytes: ^
 MasterCoderxD: actually, my main language is python and JS JLuke
 JLukeSkywalker: like an @
 JamesModifiedGames: Oh, that's neat.
 AnonymousCodess: okay i hat khan academy its just no
 AnonymousCodess: hate*
 Astrobytes: Never been a fan of the Khan Academy format tbh.
 AnonymousCodess: me neither 
 AnonymousCodess: i find it kinda hard smh
 MasterCoderxD: oh
 AnonymousCodess: any codeing website is hard for beginers tho
 Astrobytes: Well yeah. Start slow, with the absolute basics.
 JamesModifiedGames: Try codecombat.com
 JLukeSkywalker: whenever I want to learn a new language I just make tic-tac-to with ai and hangman and google until it works
 JamesModifiedGames: Now that's basics
 AnonymousCodess: okay
 MasterCoderxD: any highschoolers here? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 AnonymousCodess: oh code combat is easy looking
 JLukeSkywalker: fortran was probably my worst experience making hangman
 MasterCoderxD: :joy:
 Astrobytes: ew, the very thought :D
 JamesModifiedGames: Yeah me
 JLukeSkywalker: hey, forced me to learn it
 MasterCoderxD: James u r in school?
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, I get your strategy. It works for sure. Just fortran is... it's fortran.
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 JamesModifiedGames: Wait, I'm learning about dorthy Vaughan from NASA, and that was here first codeing language, FORTRAN
 JamesModifiedGames: Yeah right now MsterCoder
 JLukeSkywalker: its still used for doing math for space stuffs
 JLukeSkywalker: very fast
 Astrobytes: fortran is still widely used in scientific and mathematical applications, and not just legacy code either
 JamesModifiedGames:  I learned that too.
 JLukeSkywalker: back in college had to write some fortran for a study they were doing on black holes, was super cool
 JamesModifiedGames: Yeah i'm still in school MasterCoder
 MasterCoderxD: alright
 JamesModifiedGames: Why?
 JamesModifiedGames: Never mind
 JamesModifiedGames: Simann, I just realized that you had pepe as your profile picture.
 MasterCoderxD: hey
 MasterCoderxD: i hope this section is as active like this always
 JLukeSkywalker: just depends on the time of day
 Astrobytes: Depends. A lot of use are at work.
 Astrobytes: *us
 JLukeSkywalker: usually even if people arent talking, they will still answer questions if you ask chat
 Astrobytes: Be patient though.
 JamesModifiedGames: It's weird though, to see all of the activeness.
 Astrobytes: You should see it during a competition.
 MasterCoderxD: yeah, i am just saying
 JamesModifiedGames: Oh god, I don't think I could read fast enough.
 Astrobytes: Well, it doesn't go away if you don't close the window, and we do have a chat log too.
 Astrobytes: So you can catch up.
 JamesModifiedGames: Yeah true
 JamesModifiedGames: Well then I hope Ican tye fast enough
 JamesModifiedGames: And speel 
 Astrobytes: lol
 JamesModifiedGames: I can't even spell spell
 JamesModifiedGames: 54 words per minute is not fast enough.
 Astrobytes: Typing correctly &gt; typing fast
 JamesModifiedGames: Yeah that is true
 MasterCoderxD: I just won a clash :grinning:
 MasterCoderxD: K gotta go
 JamesModifiedGames: I got 54 speed and sometimes a 89-93% accuracy.
 MasterCoderxD: byeee
 Astrobytes: gg, cya
 JLukeSkywalker: gz, cya
 JamesModifiedGames: BYEEE
 MasterCoderxD: cya'all
 AntiSquid: bye
 JamesModifiedGames: Fun fact, the creators of borderlands are graduates of full sail university. (That's where I'm going.)
 ProgrammerDog: lo
 ProgrammerDog: lol
 ProgrammerDog: what's
 Scarfield: so you are making the next borderlands game?
 Astrobytes: Scarflogic
 Scarfield: AstroScyte
 Scarfield: AssumptionField could be my new nick though
 Astrobytes: InferField
 Scarfield: xD nice
 Scarfield: bit boarding chess without stealing from the wide web is harder than i assumed, joining the chess arena ChesstroBytes?
 Astrobytes: That's the way to learn though!
 Astrobytes: And yeah, some point soon I hope
 Astrobytes: Still got to finish my Fireworks bot, and test a few contributions
 Scarfield: yea, i usually do so, than after check where i went wrong and what to improve. Nice, im curious to see how difficult it is to make a decent bot for chess. a friend already challenged my non existing bot xD
 Astrobytes: The good thing is that there is a wealth of er, material, out there to learn from.
 Astrobytes: It's more difficult in this case since you can't rely on opening books so much like a regular chess engine
 Scarfield: yea, thats what i like about it, those pesky opening books :p
 Astrobytes: Yeah, much more pure this way
 Scarfield: sure! i get the challenge of creating and encoding the opening books. but since i never made one, i prefer a game without them&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's all about what you want to get out of writing the bot I guess. More fun doing books for some, not the case for others.Non-bookable games are Anti-Smits :D
 Scarfield: but there are some poor csgo newbs that needs to be taught a lesson gtg&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hahaha, cya later
 Scarfield: cya
 ejkat19: peen
 Amalgamus: Hi, in c++ 
 Amalgamus: &amp;objectInstance is the same as a methode of the object returning *this, right?
 Amalgamus: in both cases i get the adress?
 KiwiTae: &amp;o is an address , *o is a value
 Amalgamus: so *this is the object
 Amalgamus: and this is the adress of the object
 KiwiTae: yes i guess &gt;&lt;
 Amalgamus: thank's
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gheesh, OneWay City took me 9 months to solve
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess php now includes bc functions
 Astrobytes: bc = Before Computing? PHP is movin' on up! :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well cg doesn't support bigInteger or GMP, but does support bc now apparently  
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for php that is
 SugarfreeTX: i
 TBali: BC Math library is included (but GMP not afair). I also used it for Oneway city, but also for Polydivisible number and Gravity Centrifuge tuning.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: TBali yea i've had issues with many puzzles because of 'limitations'.  I don't think bcmath used to be included ... of course I'm going back a few years.  I believe i tried it 9 months ago and it didn't work
 TBali: My oldest CG code featuring it is dated 2019. August.
 MSmits: I'm just impressed you know so many puzzles by name
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well alrighty then, i guess I've been behind the 'times'
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did 2 puzzles today, i should probably quit and cook dinner
 TBali: search *.php files in local folder for 'bcadd' did the trick.
 TBali: I keep all my solutions also offline.
 MSmits: oh, I just do that for optims and bots
 MSmits: but then again i never did very many hard puzzles
 TBali: Searching for some similar puzzles can save me some time. Backtracking, floodfill, prime faxctorization, etc does not need to be rewritten from scratch every time.
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: reading what you say almost makes me think you are a Solution Manager
 Astrobytes: Whatever that means... :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 TBali: haha, we made this up because sales is too pejorative in the 'consultative selling' business
 Astrobytes: Heh heh heh, not wrong.
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: I'm totally hooked to uttt again =/ Not sure who is primarily to blame, but too many people were talking about it
 TBali: sales, tech-presales, and marketing is my responsibility but not sw delivery.
 Astrobytes: MSmits: You can only truly blame yourself 
 MSmits: that suggests I am in control 
 Astrobytes: Blame your mind
 TBali: my bot surely does not hurt yours
 MSmits: I dunno, maybe your bot plays moves mine won't even consider
 TBali: a peaceful introvert bot
 MSmits: and then it's like, oh nooes, what's this -CRASH-
 Astrobytes: Based on a true story?
 MSmits: well let's just say i have had bot versions that pruned too much
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 TBali: Spring will come, and the pruned vibes will grow again
 MSmits: it's always fixable by just doing a full expansion at the root , but you know how it goes. You want to get all your ideas out fast and test too much at once
 MSmits: pruned vibes?
 Astrobytes: lol yes
 Astrobytes: *yes and lol rather
 Astrobytes: Think that was supposed to be vines 
 MSmits: who knows
 Astrobytes: Possibly pruned vibes come from prune arrays
 MSmits: ahh yes
 TBali:&#160;:)
 MSmits: so you're just gonna leave us wondering
 MSmits: cruel

 MSmits: i found this
 MSmits: I think either pruned vibes is a thing or this person made the same typo
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 TBali: We hade some real vibe pruner in 2020. 2021 shall be year of blossom
 TBali: Is there an algorithm for that?
 Astrobytes: ceg is your man for all things prune-related
 Spartanreaper2: hi
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for tonight guys. Gn and cya later
 TBali: gn
 Nikeleos: Good night
 Spartanreaper2: what the hell is a php
 MSmits: gn
 MSmits: very intelagent question
 TBali: php - Programmers' Hell and Paradise
 TBali: you can choose 1
 MSmits: oh missed that, gn Astrobytes
 caciuleanuciprian: is the website slow for anyone else?
 MSmits: it's always slow at this time, will be over soon
 MSmits: they do some calculation
 caciuleanuciprian: cool
 caciuleanuciprian: any java tips for landing an internship?
 MSmits: not me sorry
 Wontonimo: how's your java skilz?
 Wontonimo: Hey @MSmits reCurse suggested I not bother him and instead hit you up for C++ UTTT info.  I got no questions, but thought I'd use that as an excuse to say hi.
 Wontonimo: in other news ... anyone else lacking AVX2 support on their mac&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: (nothing to do with UTTT and bit boards ... no ... definitely ... okay, maybe a little)
 Wontonimo: hmm ... okay, now I'm stumped.  __builtin_cpu_supports("avx2") returns true ... yet __m128i isn't supported
 karliso: Use __m256i?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f3063371-9374-436f-a02d-23bed0b6fb77">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f3063371-9374-436f-a02d-23bed0b6fb77</a>
 Wontonimo: thanks @karliso!  naw, just turns out I'm dumb about imports
 MSmits: Wontonimo hi
 MSmits: ask me anything, but going to bed soon so better do it quick&#160;:)
 MSmits: also "avx2"doesn't include _m128i
 MSmits: but avx does
 MSmits: import both&#160;:)
 Damderiam: I'm trying to do Coders Strike Back in Python, but no matter what I do it gives me "not in a function" error and I have no idea why.  This error seems to be unique to Codingame.
 Damderiam: And yes I've tried putting my code in a function.
 MSmits: it's definitely not unique to CG and you definitely made a python booboo :0
 MSmits: share the code and i can see if i can spot it
 Wontonimo: I was going to offer the same, and I'm up for a while.  Python is definitely my strong suit 
 MSmits: you do it
 MSmits: i need sleep  :)
 Wontonimo: got it 
 MSmits: gn and ask me about uttt stuff friday to sunday, i will have more time
 Wontonimo: cool!  thanks
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo you can emulate AVX in your mac if you lack it 
 Wontonimo: thanks!
 Wontonimo: looks like i've got it, but frankly it seems crazy slow.  making a lookup table with 512 values is about 4 times faster than my macs avx op.
 Wontonimo: not all that surprised now that I calculated that it is only 512 x16bits in the cache which can easily fit in the L1.  I thought this would be a main memory (across the bus) hit ... 
 Wontonimo: 512 is almost small enough to fit on the registers ... well, not quite
 Wontonimo: i'm way over thinking this and way over engineering.  gotta just get version 1 up and running 
 ZarthaxX: idk what is your avx op about anyway
 ZarthaxX: but cache may beat you, although that could change when testing the whole code
 ZarthaxX: as cache stuff is lost
 Wontonimo: the cached values are computed at startup, and on my local takes less than 0.002 sec to compute, only needs to be computed once, and will more than make up for the loss in the future rounds where only 0.1 sec is available
 ZarthaxX: i meant that cached values may be taken out from cache
 ZarthaxX: as there are other lookups from memory
 ZarthaxX: still, i dont know hwo complex is the avx code for that
 Wontonimo: oh, right.  yes, of course.  there is that.
 Wontonimo: and it will if I am successful in hitting 100k rollouts
 YongJing: im getting "Python 3 language assist interupted", anyone knows whats going on?
 Wontonimo: thanks for the reminder @ZarthaxX .  I'll keep that in my back pocket
 Wontonimo: @YongJing - save your work and try restarting freshing your browser 
 YongJing: okay will try, thanks!
 ZarthaxX: yw&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: you could try to check the system as a whole for 1 turn, instead of the part you change
 ZarthaxX: fix X rollouts and check

 Brevis: In code golf, do white spaces count as characters?
 2ndwolf: yes it does
 Brevis: ok thanks
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Marchete: :smiley_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 eulerscheZahl: brevis == blue force in discord?
 eulerscheZahl: on*
 Super_coding: hello
 w_k: hi
 Super_coding: im new
 Super_coding: how to make new game
 eulerscheZahl: you go to the contribute section and upload it
 jacek: another tic tac toe or pong?
 Marchete: moin
 jrke: happy caturday
 eulerscheZahl: 2048 @jacek
 eulerscheZahl: will be fun to keep it within the CG limits for a longer game :D
 eulerscheZahl: why is it so hard to clone a 2D array in java?&#160;:/
 jacek: i was thinking of 2048 but maybe something like 512 on 3x3 would fit
 eulerscheZahl: 2048 works too, if you give the seed as input and allow multiple turns in 1 player interaction
 eulerscheZahl: so the player knows where the next tile will spawn
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to do the UI in JS without the SDK or it will be too big
 jacek: JS? im out
 eulerscheZahl: fine, then it's me again...
 jacek: also, with known seed, expectimax becomes just minimax?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, removes an aspect of the game&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: 10kB for 167 framesi think that should get smaller
 eulerscheZahl: 6kB if i completely remove the graphics entity module
 Unkmar: Somebody needs to fix the channel thing.  I keep leaving the same channels over and over again.
 MadKnight: Unkmar u can just use any of external clients
 MadKnight: any xmpp client can work for CG chat
 eulerscheZahl: Jacek got your 2048 running, kind of...but the UI is all in JS<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/54927e7306266ad2583c95cbf8e3872d6def">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/54927e7306266ad2583c95cbf8e3872d6def</a>
 eulerscheZahl: lunchtime
 jrke: oh 2048 a well known game
 Astrobytes: I suggested that one ages ago but nobody went for it
 Astrobytes: Should work well on here I think
 AntiSquid: lots of games won't work well on CG with the frame limit
 jrke: hey astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hi jrke :wave:
 MSmits: hi
 MSmits: I'm in my new house, it's a mess still
 MSmits: officially don't even have internet, but someone nearby has an open access point somehow
 Astrobytes: Thief! :DGreat when that happens
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: doorbell doesnt work so i've been sitting by the door watching netflix waiting for the mechanic that installs my internet so i can watch netflix
 Astrobytes: hahaha, brilliant
 MSmits: I have been having a weird sound problem with my laptop lately. Whenever I used the HDMI beamer at work, my sounds doesnt work anymore afterwards
 MSmits: when i get back to work i can fix it by changing the output device back and forth a few times
 Astrobytes: driver issue perhaps
 MSmits: it's like the beamer hijacks the output and doesnt give it back after disconnect
 Astrobytes: Conflicting drivers maybe
 MSmits: maybe
 AntiSquid: that reminds me of that one time where i was leaching wi-fi from the hotel next door at a place i used to rent
 Astrobytes: system restore, update the drivers, roll back if necessary
 MSmits: hmm yeah but i can restore sound by going back to work and connecting the beamer
 AntiSquid: is it leaching or leeching in this context? can't tell
 Astrobytes: leeching
 MSmits: what is leaching&#160;?
 MSmits: i know leeching
 AntiSquid: leach is to drain 
 Astrobytes: like when particles from a solid are absorbed into a liquid
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: so what is leeching then&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i guess depends how much of their bandwidth i drain&#160;?
 AntiSquid: being parasitical sort of
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: so just a matter of degree then
 Astrobytes: yeah, taking a service or commodity that isn't yours, bandwidth, CPU etc
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq89rXhvmN8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq89rXhvmN8</a>
 Astrobytes: that leech put up a helluva fight!
 MSmits: your scorpion video just fixed my sound
 MSmits: I am bookmarking this video
 MSmits: there's a chance this was caused by the driver update, but i am betting on the scorpion video
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes  12:23PMI suggested that one ages ago but nobody went for it
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I plan to do Morpion Solitaire when I have time
 Astrobytes: Checked with aCat that it wasn't on his list
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how many frames we can get, but should be at least 10k atmwould need a few changes at some point
 eulerscheZahl: CG replays are verbose
 MSmits: that's a good thing isnt it?
 MSmits: then you know what :poop: means by looking at it
 eulerscheZahl: i was expecting a card game behind that Solitaire title
 Astrobytes: No, it's also known as join five
 Astrobytes: The single player one is a good candidate for NRPA, it can also be 2 player
 MSmits: oh noes, 
 Astrobytes: can't remember what the current record is
 Astrobytes: quite a few papers on it
 MSmits: that looks like another game that will get me obsessed
 eulerscheZahl: it's so easy to trap you
 Astrobytes: heh heh :D
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:(
 UnNone: :grinning:
 Astrobytes: Won't be for a wee while anyway, so you have time to be obsessed with other things for now
 Astrobytes: I usually have a few games on here on my coffee breaks, new challenge every day<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://joinfive.com/index.php?a=t">http://joinfive.com/index.php?a=t</a>

 Tiki69: if you print A all testcases are succesing idk
 eulerscheZahl: but with a terrible score
 Tiki69: yuppp
 Flares243: hey
 Flares243: how can i test run in example&#160;?
 Flares243: help pls
 MadKnight: ctrl+enter
 TheSpiffiest: Interesting.  So the test cases just give a pass/fail but you get points from the submit?
 TheSpiffiest: That's the only feedback on MadKnight's game?
 TheSpiffiest: Ooh, other stuff... I like this

 MadKnight: hihi
 TheSpiffiest: Hey! MK

 elderlybeginner: is there a server problem now? tron calculations are lagging immensly
 MadKnight: elderlybeginner are u sure u are not playing against some slow bot&#160;?
 elderlybeginner: I mean it's calculating arena very slowly, like 20% withing 10 minutes
 elderlybeginner: *in
 jacek: CSB promotion?
 eulerscheZahl: only 200 promoted :sweat:
 eulerscheZahl: but seems that it's already the end of it, so probably more
 AntiSquid: have you looked at any more reply CTF puzzles&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: nope, was busy with 2048
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how to get rid of the KEY_FRAME stuff, so the current turn limit should be somewhere around 27k
 AntiSquid: trying to do misc 3 from 2018 october (ICS stuff) ... extracted zip, got a VMDK which doesn't boot, extracted that with 7zip, got a bunch of files and folders that remind me of some kind of linux boot image
 AntiSquid: i am guessing if i get it to boot then the desktop wallpaper shows the flag or something along those lines
 AntiSquid: no file contains any string FLG: 
 AntiSquid: any suggestions how to try and get the image running?
 eulerscheZahl: no, too tired to think about that
 AntiSquid: lol ok
 eulerscheZahl: circumventing the SDK is no fun
 AntiSquid: i guess that's as difficult as the misc section of reply :p
 AntiSquid: or worse
 eulerscheZahl: that's how the 85 turn demo replay looks like:

 JFB: eulerscheZahl - what is it???
 eulerscheZahl: what is what?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i guess you missed the chat from earlier the day<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/54927e7306266ad2583c95cbf8e3872d6def">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/54927e7306266ad2583c95cbf8e3872d6def</a>
 JFB:&#160;:-) OK. Yes I missed begining of the chat and saw only expired pastebin and links to web pages with a lot of random chars&#160;;-) 
 JFB: Now I understund - you implement 2048

 eulerscheZahl: expired pastebin: it's broken again
 AntiSquid: oh nvm lol
 AntiSquid: pasted the code
 eulerscheZahl: squid your replay is a 404
 AntiSquid: how come? it works for me
 eulerscheZahl: unauthorized
 JFB: For me 404 too
 AntiSquid: but i clicked share @_@ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/489302170">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/489302170</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and the random chars are me trying to compress the game while the CG SDK decides to blow it up
 AntiSquid: whatever the score is only 816 so doesn't matter
 eulerscheZahl: which game? pending ones can't be shared
 eulerscheZahl: i'm currently around 2600
 AntiSquid: 2084
 AntiSquid: only changed print("U") to print("U\nD\nL\nR")
 JFB: It have to be bonus for score 2048 in 2048 game&#160;;-)
 AntiSquid: now i got 2692
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/8Sc1NB6">https://imgur.com/a/8Sc1NB6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and you can still keep playing
 AntiSquid: it's fixed random seed?
 eulerscheZahl: see my comment
 eulerscheZahl: buggy CG
 eulerscheZahl: the sokoban problem again
 AntiSquid: 5900 by hand online didn't play in a long time :p
 eulerscheZahl: whoops, i still have the 200 frame limit in my contribution
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uocp8g">https://prnt.sc/uocp8g</a>i should start printing &gt; 1 action at a time
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uocv3q">https://prnt.sc/uocv3q</a>maybe it is too easy as an optim and i should move it to the puzzle section :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: not even hardcoding
 AntiSquid: moz-extension://db2484c4-1433-4c8c-9fc0-eab32f49da2a/fsCaptured.html
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/odwDbLA">https://imgur.com/a/odwDbLA</a>
 AntiSquid: i made some mistakes, i can go higher in score
 AntiSquid: this is by hand, so not most optimal moves
 AntiSquid: so main trick of the game is to keep biggest square in one corner and never move it away from there
 AntiSquid: and based on this idea you build up the other big squares which you eventually merge into your biggest square
 eulerscheZahl: i know, played by hand myself
 AntiSquid: so can CG really keep track of that many frames?
 eulerscheZahl: but for my CG contribution it's too easy not to trap yourself when you know where the next spawn will happen&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: 1800 frames is no problem at all
 eulerscheZahl: if you want more, my solver would need some hardcoding i think
 eulerscheZahl: but should be possible
 eulerscheZahl: i know that code of the rings has a 10k frame limit
 eulerscheZahl: i think we could even go beyond
 eulerscheZahl: around 27k frames the replay size would reach the magic 1MB limit
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: maps
 eulerscheZahl: that would be some more headache to get around
 eulerscheZahl: maps?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: spam
 eulerscheZahl: apes
 eulerscheZahl: wait, that's not an anagram anymore
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;???
 AntiSquid: 16k
 AntiSquid: 16.9 actually
 eulerscheZahl: your score or frame count?
 jacek: 2048? yet another N-tuple game
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure if it makes a good optim
 eulerscheZahl: or if it should be a regular puzzle
 Scarfield: could be a fun puzzle to play with, but wouldnt it be better without knowing the random spawns?
 jacek: game could last thousand of frames, outside of CG limit
 eulerscheZahl: exactly. 600 frames with user interaction isn't even enough to get a 2048 tile
 eulerscheZahl: and in the end some users will reverse the seed anyways
 MadKnight: just output all the moves instantly
 eulerscheZahl: so it's equal chances at least
 Scarfield: true
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i'm doing to get more frames MadKnight
 AntiSquid: website conceded on me wtf?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YrMMTrM">https://imgur.com/a/YrMMTrM</a>
 eulerscheZahl: current limit should be around 27k (1MB replay size limit)
 Scarfield: hit "keep playing"
 Scarfield: there are some people trying to get the lowest possible score with 2048. The optimal would be getting a checker board of alternating 2s and 4s, but that seems silly for a puzzle xD
 Frost1213: Does anyone have any advise for trying to understand code. I'm new and trying to learn.
 jacek: start with easy puzzles  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Frost1213: I am but i dont seem to get what it asking me to do
 Danotris: Beware though, comme community puzzles in easy are harder than some medium puzzles and so on
 Frost1213: oh ok witch ones do you recommend learning first?
 AntiSquid: 35904 beat my highscore Automaton2000 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/TAqdi87">https://imgur.com/a/TAqdi87</a>
 Automaton2000: when i will have a hard time
 Frost1213:&#160;???
 ELKADY: can i see your code please
 ELKADY: any python 3 here?
 Frost1213: me?

 Frost1213: omg im doing that one right now and i still dont understand

 Scarfield: read the statement carefully, and boil the problem down to what steps needed to solve it, if you dont know the coding to do so, watch some tutorials, or find a better suited website. CodinGame kind of assumes you are at least a little comfortable with coding&#160;:)
 Scarfield: what language are you working with Frost1213
 eulerscheZahl: frost offline already? can't tab-complete
 jacek: rage quit?
 Scarfield: hmm i can auto complete though
 AntiSquid: nope can't complete
 AntiSquid: no patience, no focus
 Scarfield: weird, apperently it stores usernames you have auto-ed earlier
 eulerscheZahl: for mods the tab completion works differently
 jacek: they cant autocomplete for ban?
 eulerscheZahl: you have a list of users that were recently actively writing on the chat
 eulerscheZahl: i have the current users, even if they are idling
 jacek: is that so, Automaton2000
 eulerscheZahl: autocompletion for ban is possible
 Automaton2000: i have a bit more than 1 turn ahead
 Scarfield: when hovering his avatar nothing happens, he deleted account?
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't think you can ban an offline user
 eulerscheZahl: CG just has issues loading the profile from time to time, no idea why
 jacek: nah, it seems you cant over low level avatars
 jacek: hovver
 eulerscheZahl: hey, dbdr is onlinewe were wondering if Automaton2020 is your account
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: or maybe hover new accounts?
 eulerscheZahl: good to know. even squid wanted to ban Automaton2020
 eulerscheZahl: i guess it's your chat scraper
 dbdr: did he do something bad? :D
 dbdr: it is
 eulerscheZahl: messes with tab completion :D
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: but that's a good thing, as yours isn't talking nonsense
 jacek: AutomatonNN, whos the worst mod
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see that i can't replace the main reason to take a look
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i'm tempted to kick that bot
 AntiSquid: oh ok, i wanted to kick Automaton2020 because it's in the way of tab completion for Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: we're talking about the same
 AntiSquid: but nvm then
 AntiSquid: not you're not the same Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: and i tried a lot of ifs
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same as in your input?
 Danotris: Automaton2000 Am i a good developer
 Automaton2000: i did a lot of top bots
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Automaton2000 shuu
 Automaton2000: and i just got a new avatar?
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN sudo apt install auto-ping-euler
 AutomatonNN: what the hell why do you say that he didn't come out of the while loop
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: ...
 AntiSquid: hi MaliciouslyCrypticUsername how's life?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Good
 Stilgart: omg, euler is stuck in a while loop :fearful:

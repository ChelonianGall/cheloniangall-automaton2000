 programX: how to improve python skill
 programX: clash of code is so hard
 Husoski: Start with easy practice puzzles.  When you're beginning, a time limit does not really help you. 
 baominhtran: clash of code is so hard
 jacek: oO
 Uljahn: oh my
 BlueArtemis: I hate Perl with 2D arrays
 jacek: you donth hate perl otherwise?
 Husoski: I'm not a fan of Perl, period.  Putting special characters in identifiers to indicate data types has a '70s-'80s BASIC feel to me.  Not a fan.
 Maish003: ABOBA
 Husoski: I think you spelled that backwards on purpose...
 Husoski:&#160;:)
 Maish003: :slight_smile:
 RandomAustralian: I got scammed in clash of code
 Husoski: How so?
 RandomAustralian: I did the tests and it all ran successfully
 RandomAustralian: So I submit it
 RandomAustralian: then it gave me a 0%&#160;:(
 Husoski: Weird.  I've gone from 100% to 25% but never to 0.
 Husoski: Just report it as bad test cases...
 RandomAustralian: Alright
 jacek: oO
 Uljahn: you might consider becoming deterministic by fixing the seed :upside_down:
 jacek: seed is 0 and i use xorshift
 ninnghazad: i beam search basically best first with a limited queue size?
 ninnghazad: is
 Uljahn: yep, best-k where k is a beam width, also there are variations like chokudai search
 ninnghazad: hmk ,thx
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: It's not the queue that is limited, it's the count of neighbours considered.

 MadKnight: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why is your bot a ga&#160;?
 jacek: here we go
 Uljahn: jacek: any insights on GA for SR? what is a bare minimum simcount for it to converge? also is it reasonable to use faster inexact simulation in there?
 jacek: each genome is 16 actions, population size is 100 and i can do around 200 generations
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/590511492">https://www.codingame.com/replay/590511492</a>
 jacek: the number on top is generations
 jacek: also i reuse the actions from previous turns and just add random one
 jacek: fitness is in type of good old target -3vel
 Milanovich: Anyone playing in Night of War?
 jacek: last week puzzle of the week?
 Milanovich: Yeah, with the soldiers
 jacek: played some when it first came
 Milanovich: I'm in wood 1, was wondering if there were any leagues past this, like bronze to diamond?
 jacek: no. its community game
 Milanovich: Oh nice, so that means im in top 12
 jacek: :tada:
 Milanovich: Its so hard to beat any of the players above me
 Uljahn: jacek: thanks, very inspirational
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 MadKnight: Uljahn what's SR&#160;?
 jacek: solo csb
 jacek: i remark the upside down pony uses just output from the NN, 'trained' by neuroevolution on random tracks. while quite low, apparently it can finish any unseen track
 UnnamedCodinGamer: search race
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I annealed it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: should try GA, now that I know it works better
 jacek: depends. could be a matter of hyperparameters choice
 jacek: i never done SA myself
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you are right
 UnnamedCodinGamer: It is hard to make such general statements
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it might be the mutation or the parameters that might be improved
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I prefer SA since it is simpler
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the other thing that I can not quite get my head around with GA is how to combine the parents into a  new offspring in a way that makes sense for the problem that needs to be optimized
 jacek: and for SA i dont know how to choose the 'neighbour'
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, they are similar in that sense
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I just mutate the solution
 UnnamedCodinGamer: delete a step, change a step, or add one
 jacek: visualizing helps. after a while i decrease mutation <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/a52fbn">https://streamable.com/a52fbn</a>
 juma: I heard there a history tab where I can see all the games I played and my code answers. where can I find that?
 jacek: in the game ide on the left
 jacek: results and history tab or history
 UnnamedCodinGamer: do you have a global mutation rate variable that you decrease?
 jacek: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this might be worth trying in SA
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this is the thing - they are general approaches and there are so many clever/dumb things that have to do with the implementation 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you have to know the tricks and also if they are applicable to the problem at hand
 Xehanort: Hi everyone! In Code4Life, I print GOTO MOLECULES and the target in the next iteration is MOLECULES, doublechecked it from the output, what is going on? Could it be a bug?&#160;:(
 Xehanort: *I meant I print CONNECT &lt;number&gt; and target changes on its own
 struct: I think if you go to molecules then connect A-E the target should still be molecules
 struct: only GOTO should be changing the target
 Xehanort: Thats the problem exactly, I am in DIAGNOSIS and I get sample data with CONNECT &lt;X&gt; (I see that in the output) and suddenly I am in MOLECULES, without ever printing GOTO MOLECULES. Only the enemy player prints GOTO MOLECULES. Is there any chance of the game messing up my command with the GOTO command of the enemy player?
 Uljahn: maybe you are desyncing, because changing locations isn't instant :thinking:
 struct: yeah if you print multiple thing per turn things can get messy 
 struct: I would check that first
 Xehanort: hmmm how to check it? I saw that there is an ETA for moving between locations but I am still in the wood league and I ignored it
 Xehanort: (I thought it was instant for the wood league)
 struct: it happens if you output more than one action per turn
 Xehanort: I made sure I print only one action per iteration of the game (I have only one print statement at the end of the game loop) and the problem persists...
 Terrain2: oh no! i solved it to 1st place but tried to shorten to cmp, found out it didn't exist in py3, and while looking for an alternative time ran out and i didn't get to submit my working one&#160;:(

 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Totally!But why? :thinking:
 Q12: Hi, can the Certification score be higher than "better than 99% of professionals"(&gt;99%)?
 Jerrasterix: Nope
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: The real question is "Can it be lower?"
 Q12: :laughing:
 Q12: Is it like that because not much people did it or because the level of the questions?
 Q12: When did this came out?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Few weeks.
 Jerrasterix: Both 
 Jerrasterix: The questions are firking easy for professional level
 Q12: I think it is nice idea and could be use for practice for interviews but the level of the question should definitely be higher. 
 Q12: If CG want the Certification score to mean something
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Because that's fake. I guess there's no percentage involved, only scores. If you the max score you are "better than 99%", if you got a little less you're "better than 80%"...
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Still not see the interest... If it was released on april 1st perhaps, but in october... :thinking:
 Jerrasterix: maybe new trend called october fool :shrug:
 UndercoverToad: &gt; The real question is "Can it be lower?"
 UndercoverToad: managed to end the test without even looking at a single question. resulted in a poor score
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I think yes.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Oh.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Only better than 75% of pros?

 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Well, 15 minutes to finish it in a language you don't really now, and get "You're better than 99% of professionals" sounds like a f'ckin troll...
 eulerscheZahl: professionals are so low skill these days
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Yeah... ;rolling_eyes:
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Shitty&#160;; too much C++

 ninnghazad: "working"
 eulerscheZahl: i implied that even the ancient Romans said that everything was better in the past
 eulerscheZahl: so we have &gt;2000 years of just getting worse
 ninnghazad: but were they right?

 eulerscheZahl: that's a 300+ clashes thing, not fair
 eulerscheZahl: i clicked "test in the IDE" and it failed
 eulerscheZahl: the reason is that the last edit was done by a bot

 eulerscheZahl: and somehow that moderation bot breaks the "play in IDE" button

 eulerscheZahl: you fied it struct

 MSmits: Westicles
 MSmits: I am stuck on your easy puzzle retaining water
 Westicles: heh heh
 MSmits: might I suggest changing the difficulty to medium :P
 Westicles: it started as a clash but they said it took a little too long...
 MSmits: I had a brute force method that worked, but was too slow. Then I changed to a recursive method and it doesn't work yet
 UnnamedCodinGamer: @MSmits how would that help you?&#160;:)
 MSmits: not at all, but it feels worse to fail on easy
 UnnamedCodinGamer: If I am not mistaken, there is an easy way
 Westicles: just pour water everywhere and let it drain
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I bfs-ed it
 MSmits: Westicles thats the first thing i did
 Westicles: well, if it makes you feel better the french also hated it :P
 MSmits: i had a while loop that repeatedly checked each neighbor from each cell 
 MSmits: if none changed, it terminated
 MSmits: was too slow
 Westicles: huh, that should work
 MSmits: it worked for test 1 to 4
 MSmits: failed on 5 and 6
 MSmits: or does something else change in 5 and 6?
 MSmits: could be i had a bug, dunno
 MSmits: possibly doing this in c++ is not the best idea

 jacek: maybe theres paper for that
 MSmits: upperLimit[25][25] instead of [40][40]. I confused the size with the maximum water height

 MSmits: Also I think I can solve it pretty easily, but I want to have a real bot first
 MSmits: The endgame book required to solve it is over 100x smaller than the crazy one I made for oware :P
 Scarfield: what is an endgame book actually? how can you book something that complex
 MSmits: an endgame book in general?
 MSmits: in this case it's just the positions and  whether they are W/L/D
 MSmits: or  W-time/L-time/D
 MSmits: the time component might be needed because the game is limited to 200 turns. If you win in 201 turns it's a draw
 MSmits: plies i guess, not turns
 MSmits: the way you do it is not that complicated. You start from the smallest possible endgame and work your way up
 MSmits: generate all 3x3 states
 MSmits: make them all do each possible move. Some will immediately end. then do it again and use the ended games to end more games etc.
 MSmits: repeat until no more games will end. Then you only have games left in an infinite loop = all draws
 MSmits: it's more or less what i did for oware. I wrote it up in a playground
 Scarfield: :thinking: i dont get it&#160;:)
 MSmits: that's because i didn't explain it in enough detail
 MSmits: do you want me to?
 Scarfield: sure!
 MSmits: ok, so  imagine the 3 vs 3 nmm board
 MSmits: white is moving
 MSmits: each has 3 pieces
 MSmits: now imagine all configurations of that
 Scarfield: nmm?
 MSmits: nine mens morris
 struct: three mens morris
 MSmits: well yeah
 Scarfield: ah thought this was for cttt
 MSmits: cttt is interesting too
 MSmits: except for the stupid mirror thing
 MSmits: but do you want me to continue the nmm thing?
 Scarfield: yea
 MSmits: ok, so you have all possible 3 vs 3 boards
 MSmits: now loop over them, try all possible moves for them
 Scarfield: (just thought a rule to disallow mirrored moves in cttt might be the way)
 MSmits: some of those boards will have a winning move
 MSmits: for those you immediately store the end result
 MSmits: (a win)
 MSmits: then you loop over the entire list of states again
 MSmits: no games will immediately end
 MSmits: but
 Scarfield: ah and work "down" from there
 MSmits: some will lead to a game you alreadt solved
 MSmits: which means its a loss
 MSmits: (win and loss being alternating)
 MSmits: you keep doing it until no changes happen
 MSmits: and then all leftovers are draws
 MSmits: they are just cycling in some way
 MSmits: it's somewhat messy because you have to do it from both p1 and p2's perspective. You flip the board for the lookup of the gameresult after a move
 MSmits: to change player perspective
 MSmits: the stored states are always from the perspective of the player to move
 Scarfield: makes sense, but it doesnt seem viable for a game like cttt, you have to have some limit on the endgame states i presume
 MSmits: yeah there are, for all intents and purposes, an infinite number of states there
 MSmits: it only works on converging games
 MSmits: checkers, chess, oware
 MSmits: bandas
 MSmits: and 9mm (or nmm)
 Scarfield: got it ty&#160;:)
 MSmits: any time&#160;:)
 Scarfield: well at least the idea
 MSmits: yeah plenty of reading for this
 MSmits: the hardest part is generating the states and indexing them
 MSmits: you want to put them in an array
 MSmits: wayyy faster than a map 
 MSmits: but then each state has to map to a number 
 MSmits: to use as index for the array
 MSmits: the math has lots of factorials
 struct: you can also create your own map implementation
 MSmits: yeah, but it will still be slow unless you use an array and store your states compactly
 MSmits: with fast access
 MSmits: for 9mm it probably wont matter as much, it's a small game
 Scarfield: so it wont be padded, but dependant on the hash values of states`?
 MSmits: yeah some small padding is ok, as long as it increases the size 10-30% or so. Not by 100% or more
 struct: ah yes for end games its easier to do this
 struct: I was confusing it with TTs
 MSmits: with checkers there are some impossible states that have a place in the array, but it isn't used
 Scarfield: TTs i know of, still havent implemented, but didnt understand the idea of endgame books until now&#160;:)
 MSmits: oware for example, has states where all 12 holes have seeds
 MSmits: this is impossible
 MSmits: but they still have an index in the book array
 MSmits: well it's only possible for the opening, where all holes have 4 seeds
 MSmits: after a move there is always 1 empty hole
 Scarfield: unless you land in an empty hole?
 MSmits: you cant
 MSmits: they are skipped
 Scarfield: okay, havent player oware, was thinking kalaha
 MSmits: well i should say, the hole you play from is skipped, other empty holes arent
 MSmits: yeah there's tons of mancala games. Even our oware is pretty unique
 MSmits: anyways, if you want to know more. It's here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58572/endgame-books-in-oware-abapa">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58572/endgame-books-in-oware-abapa</a> 
 Scarfield: hmm wouldnt the "disallow mirrored moves" in cttt work, even if its only not allowing to mirror opponets previous move?
 Scarfield: bookmarked&#160;:)
 MSmits: it might work, not sure. Seems like an ugly fix though
 MSmits: I prefer irregular boards. Maybe the odd-size board works too
 Scarfield: odd-size just gives p2 an advantage of getting the middle cell i guess
 MSmits: p1 you mean?
 Scarfield: steal
 Scarfield: i see steal as needed for odd-sice
 Scarfield: sizeØ
 Scarfield: ø=*
 MSmits: hmm
 struct: just turn into ucttt
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: ucttt is just uttt with only the counting part instead of the overall winning board part
 MSmits: but sure&#160;:)
 MSmits: still thinking about the steal thing
 MSmits: without steal player 1 can always force a draw
 MSmits: but player 2 can't
 Scarfield: yea
 MSmits: or at least i dont think p2 can
 MSmits: it's hard to be sure
 MSmits: do you think it's not enough to just have the 2 swapped games?
 MSmits: I mean if p2 cant force a draw and p1 doesn't try to, it's ok also
 MSmits: if p1 does try to force draw, the swapped game might have the other player choose to try and win
 MSmits: p1 does have an advantage so giving it up to have a safe draw might be a bad idea
 Scarfield: even boards will have p2 having last move, odd boards p1, so i suppose odd boards have a p1 advantage without steal, but might be more fair with 2 games, no idea
 MSmits: well it is fair for sure. Swapped games are guaranteed to be fair
 MSmits: it's just not guaranteed to be interesting
 MSmits: that depends on whether there exists a way for p2 to force a draw and whether the advantage for p1 is small or large
 MSmits: p1 has a massive advantage in regular TTT and still it's a solved draw
 Scarfield: yea, might just be its a game thats not that interesting even though it seems like it
 struct: this is why I only do ports of what people ask
 struct: :p
 MSmits: what i meant is, whatever fix you apply could make it interesting or make it broken in a different way
 MSmits: struct yeah well known boardgames are relatively safe to port
 Scarfield: i would really like a backgammon port, but it just does seem the game for CG with the dice rolls. but one of the games i enjoy to play the most
 MSmits: ahh never played that, but pretty well known game yea
 Scarfield: doesn't seem the game*
 BH-Empire: im new
 struct: well it still requires skill right?
 struct: despite having dice
 Scarfield: its like poker, luck can win one game sure, but skill wins in the long run
 Scarfield: there is no bluff though&#160;:)
 Scarfield: my friends father is a coach for the DK national team of backgammon, and i will never win a game against him
 struct: just beat him with an AI
 struct: write an AI that he cant bat
 struct: beat*
 Scarfield: that is more likely than beating him irl
 Scarfield: even if dice are involved its very skill heavy
 Scarfield: probability and experience
 MSmits: make a contribution of it. Steal eulers dice. 
 MSmits: he's asleep now, you can do it
 struct: I would need to learn the rules
 MSmits: you mean you would need to code the sim and then forget them
 MSmits: that's how we roll here
 struct: and I would have to use 3d
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: gonna catch some sleep. Looking forward to seeing your backgammon in the morning
 Scarfield: for cttt even board, if p1 plays in one of the middle 4 cells, p2 cant play in any of them, which allows p1 to get 2 pieces in the 4 middle cells. which then leads to p1 getting all middle pieces, if steal is available its just p2 getting all middle cells, probably wont work. dammit
 Scarfield: gn :wave:
 struct: lol MSmits
 struct: gn
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Scarfield: could be cool with a backgammon multi, but mainly because i enjot the game irl, not sure if its gonna be interesting here
 Scarfield: maybe with the same approach as euler took with 2048 (known random), but no idea realy

 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: For anyone who has done the don't panic challenge, would you happen to know why I get an elevator position of 208?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: int elevatorPosition[100];elevatorPosition[i] = elevator_pos;
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a4ffc6e-8262-4a3a-98b2-cf5b626bb5c6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a4ffc6e-8262-4a3a-98b2-cf5b626bb5c6</a>
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I do not understand why I have an elevatorPosition of 208
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: When it should be like 5
 YCSVenom: how can i search through contributions?
 JFB: TheBrokenTraveller_5024: you set elevatorPosition[i] but check elevatorPosition[j]. Maybe it is the problem? This is all I can say when I see only a small part of the program

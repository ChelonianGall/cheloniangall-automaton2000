 BlindKing: Hello, does anyone on here feel like explaining how I can use trig to solve Mars Lander 2?
 BlindKing: in Java.
 MadKnight: why not, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i still have a chance to play against me
 Denshire: ugh trying to make a basic algorithm and then finding out you need trigonometry:triumph: what is an arccosine anyway
 MadKnight: Denshire which game are u playing&#160;?
 Denshire: code v zombies
 MadKnight: and what kind of trigonometry? what exactly&#160;?
 Denshire: trying to think of something original, with danger levels and all
 Denshire: just trying to figure out the location the player will be in after making a move towards a human
 Denshire: i honestly don't know how
 Denshire: trig might be the only answer
 Denshire: i'm trying to make a triangle, with the actual movement as hypotenuse, then find an angle and use that to find the x and y
 Denshire: is this even a good idea? i might have ignored everything related to trig in highschool
 MadKnight: u need to take vector from player to target, divide it by its length, and then multiply by player's speed
 Denshire: oh
 Denshire: thanks for the tip
 Denshire: (might have also ignored everything related to vectors in highschool but the internet will help me)
 MadKnight: they're pretty simple
 Denshire: yeah, i know, but it's 11pm and my brain can't handle it
 Denshire: i'll probably come back to this tomorrow
 Denshire: but what would be the speed exactly? just the distance moved every turn?
 Denshire: oh
 Denshire: wait
 Denshire: i just read what you wrote again and now i actually understand everything
 Denshire: it's more simple than I thought at first
 Denshire: well, thanks a lot, actually! But i'm still gonna try and restore my nonexistent sleep schedule first
 MadKnight: okay cya
 Denshire: g'night:sleepy:
 AnsarDauletbayev: Hello everybody, have some cod of this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/aneo">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/aneo</a> . I can t understand and can t find it in google. Thank you
 wenyue:&#160;?
 AnsarDauletbayev: i just start to learn python and can t understand how to make cod for this 
 MadKnight: code* AnsarDauletbayev
 AnsarDauletbayev: ok sorry) my english is not good =) 
 wenyue: Chinese?
 RuiY: Yes, hands up! I'm new here, hello
 MadKnight: no he's not, wenyue
 HardikPoudel: anyone plays fall guys?
 HardikPoudel: ive no teammates
 MadKnight: don't they have discord HardikPoudel&#160;?
 jacek: you seem so active lately
 MadKnight: because i'm back
 MadKnight: shouldn't i be, jacek&#160;?
 jacek: lets ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i would not be a good idea
 DaNinja: :grin:
 sugam: bruh anybody recently added from islington?
 jacek:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I think he's referring to the university that the guy who's doing the unofficial contest goes to
 sugam: I could not solve the simplest problem lol it's taking time to get used to
 uvBoss: just do a few puzzles u will get used to it
 uvBoss: @sugam
 sugam: what are the prerequisites to start doing AI challenges?  
 uvBoss: u can start using if statements
 uvBoss: and slowly work your way towards algorithms
 uvBoss: if its your first time
 sugam: yes my first time on this site
 uvBoss: i started with if statements and then somehow i transitioned to algorithms
 uvBoss: xD
 sugam: how to debug 
 uvBoss: which lang?
 sugam: java
 uvBoss: To debug: System.err.println("Debug messages...");
 uvBoss: wdym?
 uvBoss: just print out variables using the above method
 sugam: yeah, I found out that I can actually print on the console and test my code
 uvBoss: yea
 sugam: how to get codin point
 UndisclosedBeastAndHisDog_820d: hi guys
 Uljahn: sugam: play games in Compete section
 sugam: thanks Uljahn
 Zenoscave: Did they remove the level 3 req for chat?
 sugam: I'm level 5 btw
 Zenoscave: no, not you, sorry! the UndisclosedBeastAndHisDog_820d
 Zenoscave: is level 1
 Uljahn: maybe through external client
 Zenoscave: makes sense. can't really stop jabber
 sugam: wow you guys are pro damn. 
 Zenoscave: why do you think that? I'm not really pro...
 Uljahn: im not even a coder
 Zenoscave: yeah you're a cat.
 Zenoscave: right Uljahn
 Uljahn: pewpew
 Zenoscave: pewpew
 Uljahn: i mean yes
 Zenoscave: I understood
 sugam: ranking 43rd
 Zenoscave: ranking is a bad metric. doesn't really tell much beyond like the top 15-20
 Zenoscave: there is such a large gap
 sugam: I'm just getting started 
 Zenoscave: well keep with it!&#160;:)
 sugam: It is starting to look less intimidating  
 sugam: can i follow you two?
 Uljahn: sure
 Zenoscave: go for it
 sugam: thanks
 Uljahn: there is no need to be intimidated, you can code for fun and learn things at your own pace, solve puzzles and look through others' solutions or play multiplayers and aim for top-1k, then top-500 etc.
 sugam: Actually our college is having some kind of competition or something and they asked me to join in this site. ngl I'm starting to like it. 
 uvBoss: have you joined the discord?
 sugam: yes
 uvBoss: kk
 Collector_Nishant: is someone from this clash online to hear me
 rivancic: Hello. I am about to leave but I want to return and continue. Is there a way to save the code in Coders Strike Back?
 rivancic: Or you have to copy paste it and store somewhere locally?
 MadKnight: it saves when u play
 Uljahn: click play or submit
 wenyue: :grinning:
 wenyue: :grinning:
 wenyue: I think it's so difficult here
 wenyue: My foundation is too bad
 w-kosse: Hi! Bit new, is there a way to measure performance of one solution vs another?
 reCurse: Use a high resolution timer
 Hjax: if you mean in a multi, theres brutaltester
 w-kosse: more like general things, execution times, cpu &amp; memory use etc
 w-kosse: but coding someting in myself is probably a good way to go as well
 Hjax: ah then i defer to recurse's answer
 w-kosse: i'll look into it, thnx!
 Hjax: i would say that execution speed is almost never a concern when you are starting out 
 Hjax: if you are running out of time its much more likely that you have an infinite loop or some bug
 w-kosse: haha it's not a concern, just a curiosity, what route would work better
 Hjax: do some puzzles, when you get comfortable enough with the site maybe try a multi that looks fun 
 w-kosse: will do, looks fun so far! thnx for the input :smiley:
 sunksuperset370: 'elo
 HexObEe: hello
 Gloryness: Hi
 HexObEe: Just discovered this website today. 
 HexObEe: Wow. Wish i had found it sooner
 Gloryness: I've only been using it for 2 days but I've known it for ages
 HexObEe: :grinning:
 HexObEe: So far seems like a great place for practice (and for fun)
 Hjax: its a lot of fun 
 Hjax: especially contests
 sunksuperset370: 'elo
 DinuBrat: HI
 Gloryness: everyone on my clash got 0% because of this glitch
 PlungeDominick: I think it was just a bad clash&#160;:( 
 DinuBrat: @Ru
 Hjax: you already said that
 Hjax: oh scroll 
 Hjax: the chat box needs a "new messages below" box 
 sunksuperset370: i think i might need help here
 Hjax: whats up 
 sunksuperset370: i am in fast mode
 sunksuperset370: here me code
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8dee019a-8089-461e-a24b-53909710854c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8dee019a-8089-461e-a24b-53909710854c</a>
 sunksuperset370: :sweat_smile:
 Hjax: im not sure what you are going for there
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 Hjax: i dont know what that code is supposed to do
 sunksuperset370: what i am going for right now is that i am trying to look for S
 Hjax: it looks like it returns 1 if S isnt the empty string, and prints 0 otherwise 
 sunksuperset370: then i am creating a while loop until there is no more S
 Hjax: your loop doesnt change S though
 Hjax: and why is there a return statement in there
 PlungeDominick: s is given 
 Hjax: yes, but you want to loop through S i assume 
 Hjax: which means you probably want to change S each iteration 
 Hjax: otherwise you just loop forever
 sunksuperset370: oh wait right i forgot
 sunksuperset370: i needed to subtract s by one too
 sunksuperset370: thx
 PlungeDominick: Damn true I wasn't even reading it properly 
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f173c40a-954e-4a56-9705-a7e35c70718d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f173c40a-954e-4a56-9705-a7e35c70718d</a>
 sunksuperset370: this don't work either
 PlungeDominick: I was trying to figure out this reverse 
 sunksuperset370: time out
 sunksuperset370: ed
 Hjax: why is there a return statement in your loop 
 sunksuperset370: so i can extract the i from the loop to log it
 Hjax: thats.... not how that works 
 sunksuperset370: ooooookkkkkkk
 sunksuperset370: would you like to help
 Hjax: i is already available outside of your loop 
 Hjax: you dont need to do anything special 
 sunksuperset370: but the return shouldn't do anything
 sunksuperset370: than
 Hjax: the return quits out of your main method so you never reach the console log 
 sunksuperset370: so that is the reason i wan't getting an answer
 sunksuperset370: right?
 Hjax: thats a reason, i still dont know what this code does, i dont think it does what you want it to do 
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i mean it has been a long time since i was last on the site
 sunksuperset370: or coding
 w-kosse: i is already in your scope, your loop doesn't need to return it, just set it, returning it will quit the loop
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i am in a shortest mode now and i want to know how this works
 sunksuperset370: i don't know anything about binary
 sunksuperset370: the example given is 15 =&gt; 1111 and the output will be 4
 sunksuperset370: 'ello??
 Hjax: so whats the goal? count the number of 1s in the binary representation? 
 sunksuperset370: yes
 sunksuperset370: input 15 output 4
 sunksuperset370: that is the example 
 sunksuperset370: 10 mins left
 Hjax: i cant give you the answer, thats cheating :P i can just answer general questions 
 sunksuperset370: nono
 sunksuperset370: nonono
 sunksuperset370: i am not asking for the answer
 sunksuperset370: i am asking how does binary work
 sunksuperset370: how to convert a number to binary
 HexObEe: Hint: you can experiment with the input number given. 1+2+4+8 are the values for binary 1111
 sunksuperset370: i think i might get it
 Hjax: yeah binary is just base 2, so each place in the number is a power of 2 
 HexObEe: yeah
 Hjax: 1 is 1, 2 is 10, 3 is 11, four is 100, five is 101
 Hjax: etc
 sunksuperset370: actually i think you are mutiplying by 2 there
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 Hjax: yes that is how powers of 2 work 
 sunksuperset370: hjax i don't get it
 HexObEe: :D
 sunksuperset370: 2 *2 is 4
 sunksuperset370: not 10
 Hjax: 2 in decimal is 10 in binary
 Hjax: 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 2
 sunksuperset370: 2 in decimal?
 sunksuperset370: sorry got to go
 sunksuperset370: bye
 HexObEe: yup
 Astrobytes: that went well
 Hjax: i tried 
 Astrobytes: :D
 HexObEe: problem left hanging :D
 Hjax: explaining a new concept just by typing is hard lol 
 Hjax: maybe i should have told him to google it 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, usually easier tbh
 HexObEe: googling should be your first go-to
 w-kosse: well you did a pretty good job either way, haha
 Astrobytes: then they should ask questions after
 Astrobytes: and yeah, admirable effort&#160;:)
 Hjax: were you lurking that whole time astro 
 Astrobytes: Something tells me he wasn't gonna get it regardless
 Astrobytes: And yeah :P
 Hjax: :P
 Hjax: btw are you going to play the unofficial contest? 
 Astrobytes: I signed up, so hopefully yeah (depending on time + what it is)
 Hjax: yay :D 
 Hjax: contests are great motivation for me to play a multi 
 Astrobytes: Even if I don't like it I'll probably try to do something at least
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it does motivate you somewhat
 Hjax: i did pretty well in the last unofficial one
 Astrobytes: I remember&#160;:)
 Hjax: has Nerchio been around recently? i wonder if he will play again 
 Astrobytes: Was wondering about him the other day, I haven't seen him
 sunksuperset370: ok me back
 sunksuperset370: sorry i am in school
 Astrobytes: Then again, I've been absent a lot recently
 Hjax: maybe focus on your classes sunksuperset370&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Especially if it's mathematics&#160;;)
 sunksuperset370: i was free before
 sunksuperset370: now i am in mathematics
 sunksuperset370: right now
 sunksuperset370: i am going to work now
 sunksuperset370: bellwork
 Astrobytes: Pay attention and get good! 
 sunksuperset370: nono
 sunksuperset370: i am good at math
 sunksuperset370: just not coding
 HexObEe: cries in calculus 
 Astrobytes: Counting in binary is math
 sunksuperset370: bye
 sunksuperset370: for 5 mins
 sunksuperset370: hulo me back
 sunksuperset370: ok that was not 5 mins sorry
 sunksuperset370: but me done with bellwork
 sunksuperset370: 'ello????????????????????????
 sunksuperset370: :disappointed:
 sunksuperset370: :confused:
 Astrobytes: OK, 1 more thing to work on: patience&#160;;)
 sunksuperset370: i AAMMM LOOONNNNEEELLYYY
 sunksuperset370: oh sorry
 sunksuperset370: i was feeling lonely
 sunksuperset370: so now what i do
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: You tell me
 sunksuperset370: i need to know how binary work
 Astrobytes: Google it&#160;:)
 sunksuperset370: i was about to say i don't go for google as a source
 Astrobytes: It's fun to learn, I promise
 sunksuperset370: wait wait
 sunksuperset370: i need to listen to the teacher or i will get in trouble
 sunksuperset370: i know it is but google is not really the best of the sources
 sunksuperset370: it gives us links but not the answer
 HexObEe: follow the links
 Astrobytes: Use your common sense
 sunksuperset370: i know but i like to learn from actual people aswering the question
 HexObEe: google is just a framework for you to use
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 PlungeDominick: I'm crying, I sat there for like 6 minutes wondering how he had 5 less characters than realized how I could save like 15 with only a minute left 
 PlungeDominick: then 
 Krantt: When are the rankings updated?
 eulerscheZahl: in about 8 hours if you are referring to the global leaderboard
 Krantt: Oki ty
 INJECTOR_PRO: join the clash asap
 Astrobytes: I shall not.
 jacek: ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i guess i should try to have a big impact
 Logiman09: Hi
 Zm4j: Hi
 Logiman09: Is it bad that Clash of code is hard for me..?
 Zm4j: nah
 Astrobytes: You can always do more puzzles instead
 Logiman09: @Astrobytes I just cant code
 Astrobytes: CG isn't the best place if you're just starting out in all honesty
 Logiman09: I've started a little bit but like it's hard for me...I can't understand it...
 Astrobytes: As in, you need to know the basics first, CG won't teach you
 itzblinkzy: go to freecodecamp or soemthing
 itzblinkzy: and then when you know the basics and all that you can come back
 itzblinkzy: and maybe you'll be able to do a decent amount of the clashes
 itzblinkzy: but they are still very hard
 Astrobytes: Or try both side-by-side, depends on your learning style
 Astrobytes: And I would recommend starting with easy puzzles over clashes, to begin with
 Logiman09: mk... TY
 Logiman09: :grinning:
 jacek: any idea what game will be in the minicontest?
 JBM: tvc
 jacek: i doubt it
 jacek: no fow
 JBM: damn
 JBM: hey i can minicontest i i want to
 JBM: was thinking of first week of oct
 jacek: with blackjack and hookers
 JBM: with t-shirts
 jacek: tvc t-shirts?
 JBM: yup
 JBM: i already designed the rest of the paraphernalia
 JBM: just got the t-shirts left
 Astrobytes: naked troll t-shirts!
 JBM: naaaaw
 JBM: naked troll is just the briefs
 JBM: mmm dunno how to share pix from there
 Astrobytes: Removable velcro pants
 JBM: just a sec
 JBM: oh, imgur doesn't want me anymore
 JBM: what's left
 Astrobytes: donno, I always use imgur
 jacek: imageshack.us
 JBM: that still exists
 jacek: lets find out
 Zm4j: how can i fix problem, if my test cases are green, but submit ones fail, and i cant see those cases
 JBM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.desast.re/tvc/man-front.jpeg">https://cg.desast.re/tvc/man-front.jpeg</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.desast.re/tvc/woman-back.jpeg">https://cg.desast.re/tvc/woman-back.jpeg</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.desast.re/tvc/facemask.jpeg">https://cg.desast.re/tvc/facemask.jpeg</a>
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 JBM: inspired by some suggestion on #Fr
 Astrobytes: Utterly brilliant
 JBM: so that's 3rd prize
 Astrobytes: Zm4j - if it's a puzzle you can do custom testcases. The validators are different from the testcases
 JBM: 1st and 2nd regular t-shirts (that actually say "winner " and "runner-up" if i manage to)
 JBM: facemasks if people want to support the operation and create more t-shirts to give out to language winners
 Astrobytes: TvC Inc.
 JBM: lol
 Hjax: i wonder if they will pick a community multi
 Hjax: thats the real way to get one basically no one has played
 JBM: or pick one who'll get out just then O:-)
 Hjax: the last unofficial contest had a most improved leaderboard 
 eulerscheZahl: or launch your own alternative unofficial contest if you don't like the choice
 JBM: yeah tell me about it
 Hjax: lol
 JBM: like, seriously, tell me about it
 JBM: why did he need a separte leaderboard
 JBM: what's wrong with cg's?
 JBM: do i need to make one too?
 Hjax:&#160;? it was good 
 JBM: i'm not debating that
 JBM: i'm more in "what's the point" territory
 Hjax: fun!
 JBM: ok
 JBM: so i need one too
 Hjax: makes the contest feel more real 
 Hjax: because you can see a leaderboard of just people playing the contest 
 Astrobytes: It was to account for existing players in the multi, so he had a most improved placement metric to try and keep the competitive aspect alive 
 Hjax: yeah, otherwise recurs e could have just typed his name into the form, logged off for the entirely of the contest, and still won 
 Hjax: which isnt very exciting 
 jacek: so the game should be uttt
 Hjax: im hoping its fantastic bits 
 Hjax: that one looks fun 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/cybersecurity">https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/cybersecurity</a>that one looks interesting to me
 Scarfield: there is going to be an unofficial contest?
 Astrobytes: nice, my CTF skills are sadly lacking&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Oh hey EcksDee
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: And yes
 JBM: i've heard about those ctf contests
 JBM: and still can't figure out from the outside what it's all about
 Astrobytes: Capturing flags :P
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: and hey, where do i sign up for it?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hs-emina.github.io/autumnai.github.io/">https://hs-emina.github.io/autumnai.github.io/</a>
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/PpYr7p3">https://discord.gg/PpYr7p3</a>
 JBM: so, quake?
 Astrobytes: JBM: capturing 'flags' via various cybersecurity-related methods
 Shakerica: Oh..God...I feel so nubish I'm the only one&#160;?
 Astrobytes: (in brief)
 JBM: you're giving me the same impenetrable outside description as tge rest
 JBM: yes, capture flags, yes, security, but no general understanding at all
 RoboStac: it's basically a hacking competition and when you hack the system you get a 'flag' to prove you've done it
 JBM: so the flag is given to all who do?
 RoboStac: depends on the contest
 Astrobytes: You might have to penetrate  a server, hunt down some file, to get access to somewhere else, find info hidden steganographically or something etc etc
 JBM: sounds like "not-CTF" at all
 RoboStac: yeah, it's not really ctf in any way
 JBM: don't get me wrong, sounds like fun
 JBM: but that's not AT ALL what i picture as ctf
 RoboStac: at least in the gaming sense
 Astrobytes: The 'flags' are just goals really
 Astrobytes: Yeah I mean it's not exactly Counterstrike
 JBM: or just plain old quakemod-ctf
 RoboStac: I think it comes from more organised versions where you'd have two teams and they'd both be trying to hack each other
 Astrobytes: ^
 JBM: i heard about something like that too
 JBM: (just not (that i recall) limited to 2)
 RoboStac: but now it's just a general hacking contest
 JBM: haclking as in penetration?
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's kind of blown up into all sorts of themes and categories these days
 RoboStac: can be exploiting services, reverse engineering binaries, breaking crypto etc
 Astrobytes: JBM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/cybersecurity#technicalfaq">https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/cybersecurity#technicalfaq</a>
 JBM: yea hcould really be fun
 JBM: i enjoyed the overthewire series a lot
 JBM: i suppose there's similarities
 Astrobytes: Yes, absolutely
 Astrobytes: Anyways, I'm out for tonight. Take care all
 JBM: gn8
 JBM: wait, that doesn't work in en
 JBM: just gn then
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I still get it
 JBM: ^^
 JBM: note to self: find a more peculiar way of wishing a good night
 jacek: let the Luna visit your dreams
 JBM: who's that
 jacek: the Princess of lucid dreaming
 JBM: lost.
 JBM: oh mlp?
 JBM: took more than the first page of binging
 jacek: should do banging instead
 JBM: let's try it
 JBM: mmm it won't let me websearch
 AntiSquid: what tv show are you talking about?
 JBM: sorry, fresh out of jokes
 jacek: your small horse
 Uljahn: unity is sorcery
 JBM: discord is?
 Amadrobus: First time here, so basically, this site teach you how to create code that is un-maintainable&#160;?
 JBM: no, you'll have to exercise that on your own
 Amadrobus: Not easily read, basically, when you work for a company, your code act as a chain&#160;?
 Amadrobus: Sorry, but if company use this site for interview, like I am about to do, it kind of set the expectations.
 JBM: yeah it's kind of separate
 JBM: but not quite
 Amadrobus: The only thing I saw is people spending 7-8 minutes, writing a line, that is clever to solve a simple problem.
 JBM: you saw people here code?
 Amadrobus: I did some clash, you can see the result.
 JBM: no thank you
 JBM: clashing is...
 JBM: i wish i could say "really not what the cg tests are all about"
 JBM: but they're really not different enough
 JBM: just consider clashes are live competitions
 JBM: whereas tests are kind of live, but not too competitive
 Amadrobus: It fine to showoff, it can collapse a company when the programer leave.
 JBM: i have a slightly different view
 JBM: then again i'm not sure if you're talking gamified interviews or clashes
 Schwase: classic puzzles are an art and the bots are really impressive
 Laminator: I had an interview today where I was able to talk about my clash of codes ranking as one of my projects. Thanks everyone for making this possible by mostly losing to me
 Schwase: good save
 Schwase: i thought i was gonna have to jump into a private clash against you haha
 Schwase: that would be kind of fun actually
 Schwase: as long as there is no code golf
 Laminator: haha ya I'll have a better chance with code golf. I'm not saying I'm not the best by any means. But I think I've done good enough to discuss it during an interview. 
 Laminator: too many nots****
 Schwase: thats good!
 Schwase: was just joking around too haha
 Schwase: you do know that CG uses bots to fill up clash lobbies right?
 Laminator: Yeah, I figured the same weird profiles that left half the time were bots lol
 Schwase: all are level 7
 Laminator: I guess I should be thanking them separately 
 Schwase: just an easy way to figure it out
 Schwase: dude that french one matthieu is actually nuts
 Schwase: his fastest times are insane clips
 Schwase: usually beats me out by seconds
 Schwase: but im always amazed by it
 Laminator: I don't think I've ever lose to one unless I couldn't solve the problem
 Schwase: yikes
 Schwase: i dont know what i missed in that one
 Laminator: FR. 100% on test cases. You can bet I submitted a review. 
 Schwase: someone did score 100%
 MadKnight: is 100% even possible, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: it's hard to find a way to save your code and i'll be happy with the result
 Justin123: I got 100 but honestly I think my code was wrong
 Laminator: I second that thought 
 Laminator: hahaha jkjk

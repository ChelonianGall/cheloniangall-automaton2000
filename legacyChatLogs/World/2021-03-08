 b0ot: If you pass all the test cases but then fail one on submission, is there any way to see if you had an error or if the answer was incorrect?
 MSmits: nope, but try to make your program more general. If you hardcode a test case, your solution might not work for a case that is similar but different
 b0ot: Thought that might be the case. I don't actually have anything hardcoded. Its odd... probably quicker to re-write the whole program
 MSmits: well i dont mean hardcoding exactly, just something thats less general
 MSmits: to deal with a case that you didnt know how else to solve
 b0ot: I think I get what you're saying but the code doesn't have any special case coding
 MSmits: other than that it is also possible that a puzzle is just not clear enough about the kind of cases you can expect
 MSmits: which puzzle?
 b0ot: Equivalent Resistance, Circuit Building
 MSmits: ah sorry, thats a recent one. I havent done puzzles in a while
 b0ot: Yeah, I pass 6/6 test cases before submission 5/6 after submission
 MSmits: later today there should be  more people online. Someone will have solved it
 derjack: good morning
 Xotiic_312: hahaha so funny good morning at 8:43pm
 derjack: pm? o.O
 Xotiic_312: you there
 Xotiic_312: bye
 derjack: oh new zealand is 12 hours ahead
 Atsgnad: Really enjoying the site and what it has to offer, not the usual "Hello World!" jumbo mumbo.
 Imsure1200q: mj
 anantaCodes: i lost my code i was working on since yesterday  :( 
 anantaCodes: ..
 darkhorse64: did you run it in the CG IDE&#160;?
 Xotiic_312: hello
 Xotiic_312: hello
 Xotiic_312: hello asd
 anantaCodes: I mean i made a single submission with 69% accuracy
 anantaCodes: and then I made lots of changes to the code .
 anantaCodes: accidentally I pressed to load the previous solution to my ide
 anantaCodes: and now the old one is lost
 derjack:&#160;:(
 anantaCodes: i am dumb
 anantaCodes: ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
 derjack: there are 2 types of people: those who don't do backups. and those who will
 Xotiic_312: and you anantaCodes are the perso who does not backup up
 anantaCodes: more salt
 anantaCodes: throw me in the fire
 derjack: MSmits any breasts mentions in the class?
 darkhorse64: no turbulence in the classroom
 bigmazi: anybody else experiences (time to time) blank inouts/ouptus samples in ClashOfCode?
 MadKnight: just hit Reset code
 MadKnight: and if no then give us specific CoC names
 derjack: dont forget to backup code
 MadKnight: he said they were empty
 MadKnight: there's literally nothing to backup
 MadKnight: dude jack
 derjack: he said input/output were empty
 MadKnight: what else is there&#160;?
 MadKnight: samples are usually just a pure i/o sample
 derjack: imports for example
 derjack: but what can you know
 khraal: Hi, I've some issues in C programming with Factorial VS Exponential, my execution requires too much time and I don't know how to reduce it
 AcornBob: I want to contribute a clash-of-code puzzle, but is there a way to search all existing puzzles to find out if it has already been done?
 derjack: khraal do you brute force your solution
 nnovich-OK: Funny enough, you don't need to worry about it&#160;:)
 nnovich-OK: 
 nnovich-OK: It's from guidelines in CG itself <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines</a>
 khraal: yep, but factoriel is over double, so its a math problem rather a prog problem
 AcornBob: Thank you.
 KiwiTae: khraal logarithm is monotonic
 KiwiTae: hint hehe
 ChickenX: how can i debug values in codingame?
 DaNinja: should say in the sample code
 DaNinja: To debug: cerr &lt;&lt; "Debug messages..." &lt;&lt; endl;
 V_Brawl: can someone help me? i have a circle and a point on it (touching the circle) now i want to transfer that point 30 angles clockwise
 KiwiTae: p2.x = xcos(30)+ysin(30)p2.y = -xsin(30)+ycos(30)
 MadKnight: i PMed him 3 methods
 MadKnight: and he was confused over something else
 V_Brawl: KiwiTae thank you too, for the formula
 UnnamedCodinGamer: is there a cleverer way to test two versions of a program locally than adjusting the methods. Something like one program is in one file, the other in another and there is a program that regulates which one of the two is executed
 JLukeSkywalker: i think thats the normal way to do it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: which of the two?
 JLukeSkywalker: the 2 files with a testbench
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ok
 UnnamedCodinGamer: how do I call the two files from a third one?
 V_Brawl: in python you can use subprocess
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will look into it 
 V_Brawl: prg = subprocess.Popen('cmd command'.split())
 UnnamedCodinGamer: they are c++ programs
 JLukeSkywalker: are they compiled?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: they can be 
 JLukeSkywalker: i would just write a bash script to run them, can even include compile lines into it
 JLukeSkywalker: what exactly do you want to test in them?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the thing is that they should be able to pass inputs to each other - something like local arena
 JLukeSkywalker: cant you just include the files and make functions
 UnnamedCodinGamer: meaning?
 JLukeSkywalker: in your 2 files, make everything functions, then in the main file, include them and use the functions
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I can unify them in one program and call methods with different parameters
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes it is similar
 JLukeSkywalker: what is your goal with these 2 files
 UnnamedCodinGamer: they are two bots I want to see winrates
 JLukeSkywalker: and how are you running the game
 UnnamedCodinGamer: currently on CG only
 JLukeSkywalker: if you download the game, in the main file you pick which bots it uses
 JLukeSkywalker: would just pick the ones you want
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have not thought of that
 JLukeSkywalker: gameRunner.addAgent(WhateverBot.class)
 JLukeSkywalker: i only know how to add python and java bots, but there has to be a way to add c++
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will look into it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks for the suggestion
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: brutaltester
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 Astrobytes: Depending on the game you may need to make some adjustments to the referee  to make it work.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it seems a bit overly complicated for my purpose
 Astrobytes: Well, it plays both versions of your bot and spits out a nice  table with winrates
 Astrobytes: It looks far more complicated than it actually is
 UnnamedCodinGamer: would it work with clobber referee? it is not listed.
 Astrobytes: You'd have to modify the referee, details are in the docs
 Astrobytes: For community multis though rather than contests or previous contests I'm usually lazy, just have two bot versions included and make s small testing framwork
 Astrobytes: *a small testing framework
 Astrobytes: afk 5 mins
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, it is a rather small thing that I want to test
 UnnamedCodinGamer: for the time thinking and talking about it I would have already made it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I implemented the "solver" extension of mcts as far as I understood it and want to see if it is any good
 hahahabro1: hi
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hi
 Astrobytes: Ah nice UnnamedCodinGamer
 Astrobytes: nice improvement darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: 6x more rollouts helps a bit
 Astrobytes: Ever so slightly it would appear&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: 6*?
 darkhorse64: from a poorly written code, no magic here
 UnnamedCodinGamer: 6*26K?
 darkhorse64: yep
 UnnamedCodinGamer: impressive
 darkhorse64: This is one of the greatest asset of CG: constraints
 UnnamedCodinGamer: even after implementing optimizations discussed here and MSmits rollout method I got to around 20K
 darkhorse64: ofc, the 150K rollout second turn depends on the machine. Sometimes, it's 120K
 MSmits: UnnamedCodinGamer it also matters how you do your rollout
 MSmits: you can do 1 child at a time
 MSmits: or all at once
 MSmits: the second will give you more rollouts
 MSmits: unless you still count all children as 1 rollout (I usually do)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I do one at a time, full rollout until end game is reached
 MSmits: I get 1600-1800 of these full rollouts in turn 2
 MSmits: if you do only 1, it is very hard to compare with our method
 MSmits: your method might actually be better
 MSmits: 100+ sims for a single expansion is a bit much
 darkhorse64: It's not just sparing time on select, it makes the expansion simpler and it fits well with a solver
 MSmits: yeah but i doubt that affects efficiency a lot. It's mostly convenience
 MSmits: select is the most important I think
 MSmits: in uttt i still do only 1 child at a time. I honestly tried the all-children way for 5 different bots
 MSmits: it was never better
 MSmits: sometimes around the same, but never better, often worse
 darkhorse64: ofc, this biases selection but this can be counterbalanced somewhat with the exploration factor
 MSmits: maybe i should have refitted exploration when i did this
 AntiSquid: hey is anyone here bitboarding hex-boards? wonder what hex-board representation is easier to bitboard, square or fake 3D cube&#160;?
 MSmits: i can answer the first question
 MSmits: everyone who did yavalath
 MSmits: (seriously)
 darkhorse64: ^
 MSmits: but i never did anything beyond just numbering left to right
 darkhorse64: ^
 AntiSquid: ok so do you bitboard&#160;? and what type do you use lol
 MSmits: you use pext/pdep to get the correct patterns
 MSmits: type?
 AntiSquid: yes, when iterate through rows / columns
 derjack: huh
 MSmits: i dont use those methods
 MSmits: I just look at the hexboard
 MSmits: and number the hex tiles left to right
 MSmits: 0, 1, 2, 3
 darkhorse64: doing penguins&#160;?
 MSmits: and that corresponds to the bitboard positions
 AntiSquid: you have 1D array&#160;?
 MSmits: no, a bitboard
 derjack: for yavalath use pdep/pext to get row-4 or row-3 patterns to see if theres win or lose
 Astrobytes: no just a bitboard
 Astrobytes: no arrays
 MSmits: it's 1 uint64_t per player
 MSmits: and hex 0 is the first bit
 MSmits: hex 1 is the 2nd bit
 MSmits: etc.
 darkhorse64: and lots of tables
 MSmits: to know whether you made 3 in a row or 4 in a row, you use lookup patterns 
 MSmits: pdep/pext
 AntiSquid: nvm just confused because it's in hex
 MSmits: to be clear our way completely removes any geometric qualities from the board representation
 MSmits: you can only do lookups
 MSmits: so it's not that great
 MSmits: but it makes for compact bitboards
 AntiSquid: darkside yes i am doing pengus now, how did you know&#160;? lol i mean i intend to try the others too i think depends how it goes
 AntiSquid: darkhorse64
 V_Brawl: does anyone know when the velocity vectors get unlocked in CodersStrikeBack??
 MSmits: darkhorse64 seems quite random which of us is nr1 clobber&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I guess that from your questions. Rn, I do not have a search 
 V_Brawl: or a way to calculate the velocity vectors
 darkhorse64: Fitting parameters
 MSmits: guess we basically have the same bot
 darkhorse64: You  can compute velocity from previous,current positions
 MSmits: I'm not going to work on clobber until i can put the math stuff in and that will be a month or two at least
 AntiSquid: MSmits alright, was thinking to use one int for each row, but without bitboarding you have a fake 3D square alternative (3d array, but only use 3 connected surfaces of it) so was wondering if i should try to represent that as ints somehow
 MSmits: well it depends on your search
 MSmits: if you do mcts it might be worth it to have a compact representation to, for example, put on the nodes
 MSmits: minimax only has one state you are modifying
 MSmits: so in that case its just do/undo
 MSmits: maybe make a good bot first and then optimize? Or do you already have one?
 AntiSquid: i might use mcts but i am not sure yet 
 MSmits: i am not great at these games with more than 2 players
 JLukeSkywalker: V_Brawl: it gives them in gold, unfortunately have to just calculate them in silver or lower
 AntiSquid: yes but no clue what representation i want to use yet :D
 JLukeSkywalker: for calculating, just using last position is usually good enough
 MSmits: havent done the penguin game yet, so cant help you any more than this AntiSquid
 V_Brawl: yeah but i don't know how
 AntiSquid: knightmoves wrote on his blog he uses mcts and how he had to optimize to cover 3player and 4players too , that's where his blog post ends 
 V_Brawl: i have to store the last x and y
 V_Brawl: then what with the updated?
 V_Brawl: substraction?
 MSmits: AntiSquid typical, i dont think many players actually find a good solution for 3-4 p model. It's always messy
 darkhorse64: Link please&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 2 points lead, think he has one, didn't share it
 MSmits: anyway, gotta go home
 MSmits: catch the train
 MSmits: ttyl&#160;:)

 darkhorse64: :relaxed:
 JLukeSkywalker: V_Brawl: yes. its not perfect, but its accurate enough to get out of silver
 AntiSquid: some heuristic scoring for 3 / 4 pl
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: i got sucked in by that blog post
 AntiSquid: aren't you on the train yet&#160;?
 MSmits: finally someone articulated that tempo bonus i jhave been using for many games
 MSmits: i wanted to... 
 MSmits: but then this blog
 derjack: tempo bonus?
 MSmits: that tempo bonus is actually important for oware as well
 MSmits: read the blog
 MSmits: i am not sure the tempo is the correct name here
 MSmits: it's more like a correction for horizon effect in mcts
 MSmits: its very strong in mcts with eval
 MSmits: so you need to give bonuses or penalties depending on which player who is next to move
 MSmits: minimax doesnt need that  because all nodes being compared are at the same depth
 derjack: thats why my NNs has different inputs for player to move
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: exactly
 derjack: blitzkireg and stuff
 MSmits: i always evaluate this
 derjack: zugzwang*
 MSmits: in oware the number in eval is quite high
 MSmits: the param
 MSmits: in fact, in oware your eval drops when you move
 MSmits: because when you move, you make an empty pit
 MSmits: and empty pits are penalized
 MSmits: so you correct this with the "tempo" bonus
 AntiSquid: :thinking: this is how you delay MSmits from arriving home, now need to find out how to use it to my advantage
 MSmits: it's easy, just this:
 MSmits: += player? TEMPO&#160;: -TEMPO
 MSmits: fit TEMPO param
 MSmits: I kept this to myself a long time because when i found it, my bot got a lot stronger, in oware anyway
 MSmits: but there you go, enjoy&#160;:)
 derjack: and then youre in zugzwang and BAH!
 MSmits: TEMPO could be positive or negative
 MSmits: sure, it might not be right for every state, but having it and fitting it to 1 value is better than not having it
 OmarZaweayhAlyamaa: could any one give me some tips 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=tips">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=tips</a>

 AntiSquid: is that a jojo reference?
 HunterEhrenfeld: dog in space
 Astrobytes: who's alt are you calling weird MSmits!
 HunterEhrenfeld: #RemoveShortestMode
 darkhorse64: You're kidding. It's the mode where I suck the least
 HunterEhrenfeld: its the mode i suck the most! lol
 AntiSquid: it's the only mode that redeems clash by about 1%
 HunterEhrenfeld: i mean, im admittedly trash at code golf lol
 AntiSquid: i mean the 5-10s submits are bs
 struct: Depends on the clash
 struct: 10 sec on a few clashes is not impossible
 AntiSquid: even harder ones get submitted in 5s seconds
 HunterEhrenfeld: i mean, this one is a binary XOR and someone got 73 characters
 HunterEhrenfeld: idk how lmao
 struct: Yeah, that is cheating AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: you can save your previous solution
 JLukeSkywalker: python an xor is legit just ^ after you convert them to ints
 struct: inst xor just a ^ b?
 HunterEhrenfeld: thats cheating! lol
 Tiouz: print(int(input())^int(input()))
 darkhorse64: golf is weird at first sight but can be quite funny with python, bash, ruby, php, js
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe needs a bin()
 JLukeSkywalker: but yeah
 darkhorse64: I=input&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^ most important python line
 JLukeSkywalker: if inputs + non-looped prints &gt; 2
 baguettes: Is there a reason for the ocaml syntax highlighting to be different than all the others?
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe its trying to get you to use a different language
 baguettes: Maybe :thinking:
 samaris: hello gusys 
 agtxdy: shortest mode shouldn't reveal # of characters for other people until final submit
 lopidav: agtxdy you should suggest it on the forums
 pindsz: agtxdy, why not?
 Mr-DillinG: Hey

 Astrobytes: heheheHey SwagColoredKitteh
 SwagColoredKitteh: hehehehe types
 SwagColoredKitteh: how've you been?
 Astrobytes: Are you Haskell'ing 
 SwagColoredKitteh: unfortunately i've been cursing at dart
 SwagColoredKitteh: usually i'm rusting
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not great, not terrible. And yourself?
 Astrobytes: Aha I see. 
 SwagColoredKitteh: not great, health issues such as constant dizziness (woo!)
 jacek: :wine_glass:&#160;?
 SwagColoredKitteh: nah no alc :p
 SwagColoredKitteh: i guess in part it's not really dart i'm cursing at, more that mobile OS' are so crippled
 Astrobytes: Lovely! Nothing quite like a debilitating condition to keep you happy in these oh so amazing times eh
 SwagColoredKitteh: yes very much lovely!
 SwagColoredKitteh: oh and google being like "hey your phone should just go through us to wake your apps up"
 Astrobytes: Just be sure it's not Dart and/or mobile OS's that's making you dizzy :P
 SwagColoredKitteh: haha :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: vic20 lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Kotlin on an 8-bit ... existential crisis in the making
 Astrobytes: trictrac: Boss is not easy eh
 jacek: which
 Astrobytes: ClobberSan
 jacek: huh? he cant beat boss?
 Astrobytes: It's a trickier boss for alphabeta bots.I'm coming to the conclusion that I may have to switch to mcts
 AntiSquid: how's life SwagColoredKitteh :o
 AntiSquid: is that the actual name of the boss Astrobytes&#160;? clobbersan&#160;?
 SwagColoredKitteh: not great, how are you?
 AntiSquid: i am alright
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: No, unofficial title since we can't have named bosses in community multis
 AntiSquid: how's your coding life then&#160;? is that great?
 SwagColoredKitteh: has its ups and downs, currently fighting with dart and flutter
 SwagColoredKitteh: well, with currently i mean yesterday
 SwagColoredKitteh: i mean flutter works great but dart is not a very nice language imo, and then there's the usual things about mobile app development (yuck)
 AntiSquid: you can't use any other language for it?
 AntiSquid: i think i looked at flutter long ago, think there was some payment attached and then i skipped it
 AntiSquid: or maybe i am thinking of something else
 AntiSquid: just googled:TypeScript, Go, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Java are the most popular alternatives and competitors to Dart.
 Astrobytes: Go isn't too bad
 Astrobytes: I mean I haven't used it for anything big but it's less infuriating than Java at least
 Astrobytes: And JS
 Astrobytes: (imo, ymmv)
 jacek: what would be the eval for clobber? mobility is the same for both players
 Astrobytes: Well I'm not going to give it away in chat...
 Astrobytes: There are numerous heuristics to use
 jacek: its ok youre last :v
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah :P
 Astrobytes: It's good to consider your neighbours. There.
 Tarkro: Hey guys, how's everyone doing?  I've got a couple of questions about the CodinGame Sync app settings. Just curious about what each one does tbh. 
 Tarkro: What does...
 Tarkro: Auto Background do exactly?
 ridafkih: When I hit submit it sends me to the lobby screen with the timer at 0
 Tarkro: Prompt for backup on submit (multiplayer only) do exactly?
 AntiSquid: now clobber also appears just in progress
 AntiSquid: despite me starting it
 AntiSquid: submitted a bot 
 darkhorse64: Yep, no battles for you
 jacek: codingame sync?
 Tarkro: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>

 Tarkro: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 AntiSquid: resubbed, now it's just clobber
 AntiSquid: what does that have to do with anything tarkro lol
 AntiSquid: did you run code before trying to leave page Tarkro&#160;?
 darkhorse64: trictrac got angry and wrecked Clobbersan
 trictrac: Thanks to Astrobytes who gives me some tips
 Astrobytes: You're most welcome trictrac.
 AntiSquid: using san at the end is cultural appropriation
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 do something
 Astrobytes: It was inspired by you AntiSQuid
 Automaton2000: or do you have&#160;?
 AntiSquid: when i use it it's cultural appreciation
 <b>**AntiSquid waves double standards flag</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: We were pretending to be weebs at the time, there. Appreciation :P
 AntiSquid: seriously, why is it not made possible for us to give boss names
 Astrobytes: Yeah, somewhat annoying. Very  minor issue though. Won't be fixed :P
 AntiSquid: maybe i should do a multi with levels like some of the opti games, each level has a boss, so then it makes sense at least to have boss #
 AntiSquid: 300 bosses, 300 levels, 300x25 xp :o
 Astrobytes: I think (don't quote me on it) that there is a limit.
 AntiSquid: it's not 6 i bet
 AntiSquid: for WIP or draft contribs every wood league would get a square at the top so you can click through them and test them, but then just because they are not all displayed it doesn't mean it stops there, we have to test this and approve a game with 100+ levels :D
 struct: should be simple to test
 AntiSquid: without approving&#160;?
 struct: with approving it might change 
 struct: right
 AntiSquid: ok connect 4 is not in progress anymore for me
 AntiSquid: maybe they changed something and submitting a broken bot initially doesn't count
 AntiSquid: now i made it random
 jacek: connect4 has steal option
 Astrobytes: trictrac: See, I told you so!Now give me all your alpha-beta secrets&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: don't think that matters for a basic submit
 darkhorse64: A good Clobber heuristic may make it for EPT
 Astrobytes: This was my thinking darkhorse64 but I want to exhaust a/b approach first.
 darkhorse64: A valid heuristic is an asset whatever is the search algo
 AntiSquid: shit . only now remembered i could use:   - 'A'  to get hand position based on hand letter in fireworks T_T
 AntiSquid: card letter * 
 darkhorse64: - '1' for the value
 AntiSquid: 'A' - 'A'
 Midorin: hey

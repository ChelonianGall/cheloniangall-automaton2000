 jrke: D&amp;B is getting interesting day by day hour by hour and second by second&#160;:)
 andrew_pahl: when testing a solution to a puzzle against a test case with a series of inputs, is there a way to see which input specifically triggered a failure?
 andrew_pahl: I'm seeing that my solution returned "false" when it should've returned "true," but it's not clear which input should've returned "true"
 jrke: try debug statement
 jrke: which lang&#160;?
 andrew_pahl: python
 jrke: ok 
 jrke: so suppose 
 jrke: a=input()
 jrke: ok now you have to see what is input so 
 jrke: print(a,file=sys.stderr)
 jrke: it will print the value of as error stream means it won't affect your normal output
 andrew_pahl: When I do this, it prints all the inputs, not just all the inputs up until the one that failed. For example, I'm failing on a test that should return "true," but my last output is "true"
 andrew_pahl: meaning that one of the middle inputs produced the failure, but I can't tell which it was
 jrke: print everything in error stream and make out where the error is 
 andrew_pahl: i'll try that, thanks
 jrke: no problem&#160;:)

 Illedan: Dots and Boxes
 jrke: D&amp;B
 Marchete: I played that game on school, loong time ago
 jrke: i still play that in my school :grin:
 Marchete: I think it could be interesting, but I'm not sure how balanced is
 Marchete: maybe one side has a big winratwe
 Marchete: winrate
 Illedan: Yeh
 Illedan: P1 wins much more
 Marchete: so 2nd with heuristic bot?
 Illedan: Yeah

 Illedan: My 4 hours worth of coding is not nothing :D
 Marchete: at least rules seem simple
 Marchete: I tried to read yinsh and it was like wth!
 Illedan: haha
 jrke: wood 1 was easy i made it various bugs 
 Marchete: I didn't know that D&amp;B had a name
 Marchete: what I'm puzzled is how there were some similarities at that time
 Marchete: without internet and stuff
 Illedan: I don't remember life before internet :thinking:
 Illedan: Anyway, I'm off. cya
 jrke: B-Bye
 Marchete: we have the SRC of D&amp;B

 Counterbalance: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Counterbalance: gcc bugs&#160;:(
 dbdr: Counterbalance: what's the bug?
 Counterbalance: i have a loop that produces weird results with -O2 or -Ofast
 dbdr: are you sure it's not undefined behaviour?
 Counterbalance: it's a 7x7 loop which executes exactly 49 times, each time incrementing 1 of 5 variables, yet, the sum of those variables gets bigger and bigger
 JBM: show us
 dbdr: :popcorn:
 Counterbalance: I'll make a reproducible example
 dbdr: this guys reports
 Counterbalance: I checked the gcc open bug list - it's huge..
 JBM: with all those people finding bugs and no one fixing them
 Counterbalance: ok when I make a minimal example it works fine.... it's in a recursive function with depth 2 so maybe something goes wrong there
 Counterbalance: It's really straightforward code

 jrke:&#160;;)
 Counterbalance: hmmm i think i may have found the problem using valgrind
 darkhorse64: instead of your ternary, why don't you perform a popcount&#160;?
 Counterbalance: thought about that, but it's only 2 bits
 darkhorse64: it's only one op
 Counterbalance: true, i'll add it later&#160;;)
 Counterbalance: Ok, the cause was indeed undefined behaviour; apparently, if you wrap the call to that countNums in an   if (array_of_size_n[n]) all hell breaks loose..
 darkhorse64: Yeah, when your code goes wild, overflow is most often than not the cause
 darkhorse64: *more*
 Counterbalance: I'll definitely remember that.&#160;:)

 Counterbalance: yeah, i sim depth 2 when me or the opponent can take a square

 dyc3: has anybody attempted the puzzle of the week? I'm stuck
 Zm4j: i'm doing it atm
 The_Auditor: you don't need backtracking for the puzzle of the week
 dyc3: I'm stuck specifically on the case `{{}[{[]}]{}}`, I'm outputting true and it's expecting false
 The_Auditor: the verification conditions are ... simpler then the normal brakets puzzle
 dyc3: Am I missing something? This case has matching brackets so it should be expecting true, right?
 The_Auditor: something else is wrong. the sequence you pasted is correct on it's own
 Zm4j: ye that is true
 Zm4j: are you looking at right example?
 The_Auditor: there are multiple cases in on one run, could it bethat it's complaining about another case&#160;?
 dyc3: no, test case 3 "Unextreme at little cost" expects all false, and this is the only one returning true for me
 Zm4j: {([]){}())
 Zm4j: this is 1st case in 3. test
 The_Auditor: there is a &gt; in the middle
 dyc3: OH i typoed
 dyc3: I wasn't including the &lt;&gt; brackets
 The_Auditor: there is a missing } at the end
 The_Auditor: yes, &lt; &gt;  matter in this puzzle
 dyc3: yeah whoops
 dyc3: thanks fellas
 Chris01: anyone know Java?
 The_Auditor: yep
 The_Auditor: but google know better . . .
 Tee-Resa: sure, wheres the problem?
 Chris01: im on the Mars Lander - Episode 1
 Chris01: i made a if {} but i dont know how to combine it with the System.out.println("0 3")&#160;;
 Chris01: error messege says: Expected two integers but found '0' and 'i'
 Chris01: cause im trying to implement the if {} into the soulution
 Yasser: if (your condition) {System.out.println("0 3")&#160;;}
 The_Auditor: println("" + x + " " y);
 The_Auditor: println("" + x + " " + y);
 Chris01: but if it wants "integers", why do you use the "" symbols?
 Chris01: arent those for Strings?
 Tee-Resa: to make the int to a string
 Tee-Resa: else you would add the two numbers
 The_Auditor: the output is always converted to strings in these puzzles
 Tee-Resa: println(a + b); is one number
 Chris01: holy shit, the code Yasser cam with worked
 Chris01: im stupid, when i see the code like it is now idk how i didnt see it before
 Chris01: thanks
 TheScore: someone who solved Chuck Norris in C#???
 Tee-Resa: sry, only know the basics of c#
 The_Auditor: i only know the dull version - java
 TheScore: What language do you know?
 jacek: english
 The_Auditor: also, i can't c# , because i wear glasses
 Tee-Resa: bad jokes incoming
 TheScore:&#160;:)))
 The_Auditor: guys, are you doing assignments from school or something&#160;?
 TheScore: no
 jacek: its my hobby
 Tee-Resa: uni yes
 Chris01: Using this as practice so i can do better on the assignement
 Chris01: started with Java like a week ago tho
 Tee-Resa: only hoppy, impresive :D
 Tee-Resa: *hobby
 The_Auditor: hobby here too . . . 
 TheScore: where can i get some help&#160;?&#160;:((
 The_Auditor: professor google, maybe... What's the problem&#160;?
 TheScore: Chuck Norris&#160;:((
 Tee-Resa: is it just understand or code technically
 Tee-Resa: google is your best friend
 TheScore: my code seems.. correct&#160;:))) that's why I don't know that to do now
 TheScore: what to do*
 Tee-Resa: debug your code, pretty helpful
 The_Auditor: add debug print out to verify your assesment that the code is correct
 Tee-Resa: same idee XD
 The_Auditor: if it does not pass, then it's not correct - need to find in what way it is not correct
 The_Auditor: have to do this or a living...
 SPDene: @TheScore what's the problem? is every test failing? or just certain ones?
 Tee-Resa: copy paste to your local interpreter and use the debug mode
 TheScore: The problem is Chuck Norris. I'm doing it in C#
 SPDene: describe why it's not working. are test failing? which one?S what errors?
 TheScore: Every test is failing for now. I'm aiming to do first 2 tests 
 TheScore: But 
 TheScore: Even if my code seems correct to me
 TheScore: FailureFound: "0 0 00 000 0 0 "Expected: "0 0 00 0000 0 00"
 Tee-Resa: then you know exactly where the error is
 SPDene: re-read the description - it explains why "0 0 00 0000 0 00" is the right answer
 TheScore: I also know why
 TheScore: the code works for the first block of 0
 TheScore: it is 0 0
 TheScore: but for the others it writes the correct number of 0s - 1&#160;:((
 jacek: so add +1 [solved]
 Tee-Resa: can only recommend you to run it locally in debug mode to check your variables step by step
 TheScore: i can't add +1. It won't work for the first block of 0s anymore&#160;:)))
 Tee-Resa: use an boolean too check if its the first one or not
 TheScore: yeah, maybe i'll try this but I really want to know why my code isn't working
 TheScore: Can I show it or something?
 Tee-Resa: we will not understand that without working our way into it, it is easier to run it in debug mode, then you can quickly see where you are losing a number
 jacek: eeyup
 SPDene: are you putting "the number of zeros" in a vraiable? if so, is the value of that correct (print it)?
 SPDene: if it's wrong, there's something wrong with the way you count the 0s; if it's right, there's something wrong with the way you output that number of 0s
 TheScore: yeah, i'm puting it in a variable
 TheScore: @Tee-Resa I ran it in visual studio
 TheScore: with breakpoints
 Tee-Resa: @TheScore found error then?
 Schwase: um
 Schwase: is CG bugged?
 The_Auditor: @TheScore, when you transform the message CC into binary, you get the same output as the example?
 Schwase: anyone missing the "back" button?
 TheScore: Yes. In binary I get the correct output
 Schwase: im having trouble with "Escaping the cat" contribution
 Schwase: OupsAn error occurred (#510): "An error has occurred during compilation/execution.".
 SPDene: I'm getting the same error @Schwase. it worked when I first saw it several days ago

 eulerscheZahl: where is my struct? :sob:
 dbdr: all 1 letter and 1 digit usernames are taken, all 62 of them
 dbdr: well, 63
 jacek: can emoji be in the username?
 eulerscheZahl: only a-zA-z0-9_ i think
 dbdr: JBM, I think the system is supposed to prevent using the same username
 dbdr: _- both allowed
 eulerscheZahl: and someone (cyberpunk?) found a user with a space in the name
 JBM: try BrunoSilva
 dbdr: nice
 eulerscheZahl: but how?
 JBM: [MAR]  Bigtoto  for a space
 dbdr: maybe created before they prevented it?
 JBM: two acually
 eulerscheZahl: incomplete account deletion?
 dbdr: username: codingame
 dbdr: that can be confusing :D
 JBM: "MesmeriZing Macho Machine"
 JBM: "Copy n Paste"
 JBM: the "space" omnes all have userids &lt;= 999999
 JBM: could be that
 dbdr: yeah, easier to enforce on new than to know how to deal with existing violations
 dbdr: I had a same problem in a past life
 dbdr: *the
 JBM: do tell
 JBM: was similar on SO
 dbdr: just that, had a DB of users, realized similar names were a problem
 JBM: nicks used to have a minlength of 1
 JBM: now it's three
 dbdr: I even enforced case insensitive unicity, unlike CG
 JBM: but they force-changed people
 dbdr: - there are safety regulations on minimum crew size- what's the minimum crew size?- hm, one I guess
 JBM: well a lot of accounts on cg don't have a nickname at all
 jacek: i just realized something, took me a while. in d&amp;b you can declare win if you have 25 score :o
 JBM: that last accepted puzzle reads like it was straight out of SPOJ
 JBM: greedy &lt;-&gt; hard o_O
 dbdr: jacek: yeah, the game could end at 25

 Hjax: flavor of the month game is dots and boxes now?

 Illedan: 5x5 is solved
 Hjax: i see
 Hjax: are the people below jrke doing a search? 
 Hjax: because jrke is definitely doing a really straight forward heuristic 
 Hjax: play the closest square to the top left that doesnt allow your opponent to gain a square
 Hjax: am i missing something here?
 Illedan: I think some in the top are doing MinMax or MCTS or something
 Illedan: I'm just doing heuristics..

 Schwase: im working on an i/o puzzle
 Schwase: private right now but i think im almost ready to go to WIP
 Schwase: just need to code my solution
 Schwase: im working on them now
 Zenoscave: Ok
 Zenoscave: I like the idea. I'll code a solution once the rules are finalized.
 Schwase: cool
 Schwase: any thoughts on how to do the queen?
 Zenoscave: I would approach as an extension of the neighborhood.
 Schwase: ...?
 Schwase: what
 Zenoscave: Urm. trying to math it one sec.
 Schwase: no not code
 Zenoscave: I know. 
 Schwase: i mean how to design the queen's movements
 Zenoscave: I am trying to describe it but having a hard time with the description&#160;;)
 Schwase: ok no worrie
 Schwase: s
 Schwase: did you see the comment about the queen?
 Zenoscave: yes
 Zenoscave: I don't understand what #1 entails
 Schwase: can move in x, xy, xyz etc
 Zenoscave: is A1a =&gt; B2c viable
 Schwase: definitely not
 Schwase: do you mean A1a to B2b?
 Zenoscave: It isn't quite obvious to people who are not familiar with 3d Chess.
 Schwase: its not real 3d chess actually
 Zenoscave: My point still stands
 Schwase: fair
 Schwase: its 3 space
 Schwase: a queen must move the same number of spaces in all directions she travels
 Zenoscave: That's what I was trying to figure out how to say. 
 Zenoscave: bingo.
 Zenoscave: That is the right approach I think
 Schwase: so no, A1a =&gt; B2c is not viable, because her delta(x,y,z) = (1,1,2) but it can only be (d,d,d)
 Zenoscave: so a vector &lt;2, 2, 0&gt; is fine but not &lt;2, 3 ,0&gt;
 Schwase: yes
 Zenoscave: I agree totally but I just wanted to show it isn't clear by description
 Schwase: its ok
 Schwase: im a physics major so i sometimes talk in gibberish haha
 Schwase: so my question would be is &lt;2,2,0&gt; ok and is &lt;2,2,2&gt; ok. Should only one be ok and which one
 Schwase: also &lt;2,0,0&gt; is ok
 Schwase: basically:
 Schwase: &lt;2,0,0&gt; is going to be OK
 Schwase: &lt;2,2,0&gt; may or may not be OK
 Schwase: &lt;2,2,2&gt; may or may not be OK
 Schwase: and im not sure how to decide
 Schwase: i kind of feel like making the queen either a rook or a bishop and disallowing &lt;2,2,0&gt;
 Schwase: ok, ive just changed the puzzle to WIP
 Schwase: i needed to add filler just to convert it
 Zenoscave: Id say 1 would make the problem easier to describe but I agree with 2 asa theoretical purity porition
 Schwase: awesome. im sticking with 2
 Schwase: appreciate the feedback

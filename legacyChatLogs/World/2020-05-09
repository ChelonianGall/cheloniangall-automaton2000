 thethiny: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: I can't without knowing what you need help with
 thethiny: lol x2
 BenjaminUrquhart: so technically, no I can't atm
 my_genjutsu: i ned help
 my_genjutsu: im buring
 BenjaminUrquhart: clearly
 thethiny: what do you need help with?
 my_genjutsu: im burning
 thethiny: oh
 my_genjutsu: i ned notch apple
 my_genjutsu: help
 thethiny: damn
 my_genjutsu: help2
 my_genjutsu: help3
 my_genjutsu: help4
 my_genjutsu: help 5
 ZarthaxX: he is just a troll thethiny
 ZarthaxX: leave him

 eulerscheZahl: others websites got creative with troll handling. like only users who are themselves trolls can see a troll
 eulerscheZahl: and the troll doesn't even know that he was flagged
 my_genjutsu: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: I can't tell if this is reverse psychology or not
 TheAtomicStopwatch_c7ec: he's a troll
 thethiny: can we take a moment to appreciate the graphics of the game
 BenjaminUrquhart: moments has passed, carry on
 BenjaminUrquhart: moment*
 my_genjutsu: oh no a website that i barely visit is going to separate me with other "trolls"
 my_genjutsu: im so scared
 thethiny: Guys what good debug things I can show on top of the pac?
 thethiny: What are some useful messages?
 BenjaminUrquhart: whatever you want
 thethiny: I know but I mean what should I put
 thethiny: currently it's visible pellet count
 TheAtomicStopwatch_c7ec: jack stop spamming the chat with pleas of help
 thethiny: maybe heading direction? Total pellets towards direction?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I put destination and how much time elapsed between start and that pac's processing
 my_genjutsu: whos jack
 thethiny: okay, thanks

 thethiny: check this behavior at 41-50
 thethiny: a paper that can't eat a rock
 BenjaminUrquhart: struct already found that
 thethiny: oh okay
 thethiny: I saw this in the rules but never saw it in action
 RubenFilipe: u won tho
 BenjaminUrquhart: btw we're at 1997 bronze players
 BenjaminUrquhart: RubenFilipe is him versus himself
 BenjaminUrquhart: he better win
 RubenFilipe: I noticed xD
 RubenFilipe: A tie would be fairer tho
 Ken_Fool: omg the sun is out
 Ken_Fool: gn8
 BenjaminUrquhart: :wave:
 Ken_Fool: gl
 LelouchVC2: gn
 RubenFilipe: gn
 BenWo: 'nite
 Neabfi: is it a bug the fact that the paper can’t eat the rock&#160;?
 dbdr: it can. did it collide with something else maybe?
 aCat: welcome again chat&#160;;-)
 dbdr: for those who don't know: if the chat is dead, try discourse
 eulerscheZahl: *discord
 eulerscheZahl: 2 typos in 1 word
 dbdr: :trophy:
 dbdr: what's the second typo?
 dbdr: I guess it's time to parse that type_id parameter&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: Fucks sakes, my code keeps giving order to dead pacs
 LelouchVC2: It shouldn't be, I only use the pacIds it gives me&#160;:((
 dbdr: one easy mistake is to confuse the pcaid with the rank of the pac in your list of pacs
 LelouchVC2: What's that?
 LelouchVC2: All I have is an if statement, if "mine" is true, then it saves the Id given
 LelouchVC2: And those Ids are updated every turn, so idk why it's spitting out dead pac numbers&#160;:/
 LelouchVC2: Other than that bug my pacs are ripping faces off opponents
 dbdr: my mistake was to save those live pacs in a vector, then assume the id of the pac is the same as the rank inside the vector
 LelouchVC2: What rank?? Where do you get that?
 JohnCM: maybe you should store the pacid in a struct datatype together with the rest of the pac parameters? that way won't get mixed up?
 LelouchVC2: That's where it is
 JohnCM: haha i'm just saying, haven't seen your code so I don't know what the problem might be
 LelouchVC2: Sitting comfy in a vector of a class
 JohnCM: then print the pacid when it is assigned, and when it is printed in the statement
 JohnCM: maybe there is an overwrite somewhere due to misreferencing
 JohnCM: or when you copy the id over, you may not have copied the data, but rather copied the pointer instead
 LelouchVC2: The variable is only accessed 3 times, once to assign, twice to output. 
 LelouchVC2: There's no pointerrs in my code&#160;:((
 LelouchVC2: The Ids are initalized to -1, so the if statement is definitely going off, and the Ids are being assigned
 JohnCM: means.. is the length of the orders correct
 JohnCM: like "MOVE 0 12 1|MOVE 1 23 2" for surviving pacs 0 and 1
 LelouchVC2: The length of the vector is 5 for the max number of pacs. But the loop variable is one that starts as 0 and is incremented everytime the if statment goes off 
 LelouchVC2: If statement goes off if bool mine is true
 JohnCM: then you may not have saved the right pacid
 JohnCM: you may have saved your loop index instead
 LelouchVC2: cin &gt;&gt; pacId
 LelouchVC2: pac[myPacs-1].id = pacId
 LelouchVC2: Haven't been saving the index&#160;:/
 JohnCM: anyhow just make sure your input pacId is the same as your output pacId. you can do a sanity check by just input and output the pacId without the rest of your code
 LelouchVC2: I've wanted to, the shitty thing about this bug is I need to wait for a pac to die before I can see where the issue is
 JohnCM: pac[myPacs-1].id = pacId
 JohnCM: if you save this like that... how do you reference it?
 JohnCM: i assume myPacs is your loop index
 LelouchVC2: In the loop governed by "visiblePacCount" i have an if statement checking for "mine" to be true
 LelouchVC2: Everytime it's true, myPacs++
 LelouchVC2: So it keeps track of how many pacs are accounted for
 JohnCM: i see.. then when you reference it you loop from 0 to myPacs -1 right?
 LelouchVC2: Exactly
 LelouchVC2: And it outputs all the pacs even if they're dead
 LelouchVC2: It deffinitely resets to 0 every loop
 LelouchVC2: every game loop*
 JohnCM: haha your code sounds right
 JohnCM: but i have a simple solution to your problem
 JohnCM: add a list "alivepacs"
 JohnCM: append the pacId of the alivepacs into that list
 JohnCM: when it comes to output time
 JohnCM: skip whatever pacId not in that list
 JohnCM: you'll use one more array, but at least it makes sure you don't output anything you shouldn't
 LelouchVC2: I was about to do that, but I'd end up using the same conditions that are somehow failing now
 JohnCM: not true..
 JohnCM: you can print out the list "alivepacs" during debugging and see where your code goes wrong
 JohnCM: both at the input section and output section
 JohnCM: it's better than just using myPacs as the index, harder to debug
 JohnCM: anyway, good luck!
 LelouchVC2: Thanks &lt;3
 JohnCM: btw, anyone knows how can you fight against an earlier version of your own AI? like can you trace back the submissions you made earlier and fight each of them
 LelouchVC2: One AI needs to be submitted, the other on your IDE
 LelouchVC2: that's the only way to put them against each other
 JohnCM: oh... ok that's what i thought too
 JohnCM: means only the latest version of your submitted ai vs your current one
 JohnCM: fair enough
 Gorbit99: generally speaking that's not really a good idea anyway
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Doju: Heya everybody
 Doju: woow, Nerchio still holds second place?
 eulerscheZahl: the ranking really doesn't matter yet
 LelouchVC2: Euler, send me your code
 LelouchVC2: I'll use it
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, against the rules
 eulerscheZahl: and it's incomplete anyways
 LelouchVC2: Aww
 LelouchVC2: I suck ur pp?
 Doju: Where can you even read the rules?
 Doju: I can't find them
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/rules">https://www.codingame.com/rules</a>
 LelouchVC2: This guy has the rules handy
 Doju: aha, gotcha
 jacek: he IS the rules
 eulerscheZahl: Article 8: Exclusion
 LelouchVC2: Article 13: Gay 
 eulerscheZahl: article 15 gives a link to the rules. so i need the rules to find the rules? :D
 LelouchVC2: You must be born within the universe to create the universe
 Doju: Well, i wrote like 7 lines of really vague pseudocode to someone
 Doju: i guess i'm a criminal
 jacek: :police:
 eulerscheZahl: :cop:
 Doju: what even is the point of this "Obfuscating your code as well as creating obstacles to its reading and understanding."?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't want CG to see what you do
 Doju: Why?
 ltmoran: My code is pretty obfuscated and I'm not even trying
 LelouchVC2: ^
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/urexugedaz.rust">https://hastebin.com/urexugedaz.rust</a>
 dbdr: did I get this right?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: some players compiled the program offline and submitted a binary, encoded in a base85 string
 Doju: Oh 
 LelouchVC2: Some players are too intense for me
 eulerscheZahl: that way they get higher performance as they can set the compiler options
 Doju: I see.
 eulerscheZahl: but it prevents cheat detection
 eulerscheZahl: (several players using the same code)
 whadk: how do you stop a command going to a pac when it dies because I used only the pacs in the inputs but sometimes the pac dies after the command is given
 dbdr: I guess it would also be useful if someone found a security flaw and abused it
 ltmoran: if (myScore &lt; enemyScore): 
 dbdr: say a way to make the opponent bot crash
 ltmoran: myScore = 99999
 Doju: I think my visibility function thing is gonna be waayy too slow...
 Doju: checking a bunch of squares for every pac on every move
 LelouchVC2: OMG
 LelouchVC2: IF THE PAC IS DEAD
 LelouchVC2: WHY IS IT GIVEN TO ME IN THE LOOP 
 whadk: because it dies after youre given the input
 jacek: it isnt?
 whadk: sometimes that happens
 LelouchVC2: kill me daddy
 whadk: same
 eulerscheZahl: dead pacmen are not given, you must have a bug in your code so you don't reset
 eulerscheZahl: or maybe printing 2 lines in 1 turn sometimes
 dbdr: it's easier to complain about the referee than to fix your code&#160;;)
 dbdr: but less useful
 whadk: theres probably a way to fix it though
 whadk: even in the other case
 JohnCM: just make sure you output only one line per turn
 whadk: ok ill try that
 JohnCM: also a line ends with a newline ('\n'), not a straight bracket ('|')
 LelouchVC2: Dead pacmen are not given?
 LelouchVC2: Tell that to Satan
 whadk: ahh thats it
 whadk: thanks
 JohnCM: glad to help
 LelouchVC2: Can't be denied
 LelouchVC2: It's giving my the pacId of a deadpac
 LelouchVC2: I outputted the Id given right after the pac died
 JohnCM: maybe you have the same issue as whadk
 JohnCM: make sure you only output one line at a time per game turn
 LelouchVC2: It's only 1 line, otherwise it would have given an error on the first turn
 JohnCM: haha i made the ai bot timeout before by outputting multiple lines
 JohnCM: the referee did not catch it
 LelouchVC2: Lol, that's intense
 JohnCM: i was wondering why i got 1st with only 1 game turn
 LelouchVC2: I thought it was strange my code wasn't working. I copied and pasteed code that was working earlier thinking I had broken something
 LelouchVC2: but still didn't work
 dbdr: there is nothing to catch. if you output several lines, it means you give actions for the next turns in advance
 Doju: There are no other kinds of cells than wall, empty, pellet and super pellet, right?
 Doju: and pac
 LelouchVC2: There's the mitochondria
 LelouchVC2: the powerhouse of the cell
 Doju: Oh right i'll add that thanks
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: I'd be at least top 300 if this fucking thing was working
 Doju: What are you working on?
 LelouchVC2: my code is consistently ahead of the opponents I put it up against
 LelouchVC2: keeps giving orders to dead pacs
 LelouchVC2: I check the pac Id given RIGHT after a pac dies, it literally gives me the id of a dead pac to use
 Doju: that's odd
 LelouchVC2: I went through my code and up and down, and now this output confirms it&#160;:((
 LelouchVC2: LoL
 Doju: my pacs are currently chasing pellets that don't exist
 Doju: they are completely blind
 LelouchVC2: They're dreamers
 Doju: Indeed
 Doju: Also I have to figure out a fast way to get dead ends
 Doju: I guess I could adapt my BFS to that
 Lentaq: borrow Lelouch's code, apparently he's good at finding dead things &gt;:)
 Doju: hahah xDD
 LelouchVC2: Damn Lentaq do me dirty like that
 LelouchVC2: Nothing i can do. I looked my code up and down, there was nothing wrong in the logic or semantics
 JohnCM: all the best guys! i'm trying to get my rock scissors paper mechanic right. haha right now my rock is still running away from an opponent scissors
 LelouchVC2: I output the pac Ids I get after the turn, and they literally have the dead pac in them
 shashwat986: LelouchVC2 are you checking the `mine` flag?
 Doju: JohnCM I have no RPS mechanics at all&#160;:|
 LelouchVC2: Its the sexiest flag ever shashwat986
 JohnCM: haha you don't need them at first
 LelouchVC2: Yes i check it
 JohnCM: but for the top 200 increasingly ppl use them
 shashwat986: XD
 LelouchVC2: That's the only time I take in pacIds
 Doju: I think once i get this vision system working i'll climb to somewhere around 400
 JohnCM: i once lost a game in 5 turns cause the opponent transformed and killed both my pacs
 Doju: Then i need the dead end thing
 Doju: and speed
 shashwat986: I tried to avoid collisions, and instead of going up the rankings, I just lost 30 ranks
 shashwat986: dunno what's wrong XD
 LelouchVC2: ikr, that's me every time i fix a bug
 LelouchVC2: The bug was keeping me strong all along
 shashwat986: ha
 JohnCM: it's a "feature" then
 LelouchVC2: If this broken website isn't working properly tomorrow I'm done with the contest
 LelouchVC2: Wasted so much time debugging when it's literally just giving me wrong info&#160;;(
 LelouchVC2: What languages is everyone using?
 JohnCM: at least you now know debugging:) that's a plus
 LelouchVC2: I've always known debugging? :oo
 JohnCM: i'm quite grateful to codingame actually. i started this site about a week ago, and i massively improved my coding skills already
 JohnCM: i'm using python.. but i never implemented any bfs, dfs, dijkstra, a*, string parsing by my own. i mainly copied from other sites. doing the code on my own helped
 LelouchVC2: Only thing this site has made me learn is how to right shit code to win clash of code and make me learn A LOT of binary to hex to decimal conversions because why the fuck no
 BenWo: I'm using python as well
 BenWo: also, using cg to learn python :unamused:
 LelouchVC2: Well, I'm outta here
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: Except Carlos
 JohnCM: lol:)
 shashwat986: That's why I like challenges more. It's different and fun
 shashwat986: chai LelouchVC2

 cegprakash: hey anyone knows which file the execution starts in referee?
 cegprakash: I saw pacman.java there's nothing there
 cegprakash: alright game.java
 cegprakash: found it
 cegprakash: fix it shashwat986
 cegprakash: or may be u are playing it safe
 cegprakash: it's hard to predict enemy type.. say if u are paper and enemy is rock and u think he's going to change to scissors (as per minimax) so you change to rock but instead he remains a rock and wrecks you
 cegprakash: so I think what u are doing may be safe..
 cegprakash: and can work
 akshat: What timezone does CG follow for league opening?
 eulerscheZahl: 6pm CEST
 akshat: Thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: central european summer time
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: does any one know in contest if pac is killed is pac_id given as input?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: I am trying to find if my pac is alive
 cegprakash: you will only get alive pacs in input
 cegprakash: if your pac is dead you won't get it as input
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: okay thanks
 whadk: i just realised if you use the newline character to only output one line it makes no pacs get any command in the next round
 eulerscheZahl: but hard to tell if yo killed an opponent pacman
 whadk: but how else are you supposed to avoid dying after a command is given and losing the game as a result
 whadk: because bad command pac doesnt exist
 kovi: euler - true...would be nice to get some score for it
 eulerscheZahl: i'll add a killing feature anyways
 cegprakash: whadk u need to use pipe symbol 
 whadk: at the end of the line?
 cegprakash: on same line
 whadk: ok ill try that too then
 cegprakash: something like this
 cegprakash: MOVE 0 2 5 |MOVE 1 26 3 |MOVE 2 24 7 
 cegprakash: u shouldn't have a trialing pipe as well
 whadk: so a \n at the end of the line 
 whadk: thats what I was trying before causing no command recieved
 whadk: I think im doing something wrong
 cegprakash: u have to print exactly 1 line
 whadk: yeah I do MOVE 0 2 5 |MOVE 1 26 3 |MOVE 2 24 7 \n
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yo i am still getting my killed pac_id as input.
 whadk: without the \n the pac dies after a command is given
 cegprakash: yes
 whadk: so I get bad command
 cegprakash: u need a \n at the end of line
 whadk: and with the \n it gives no command to the next round
 cegprakash: don't use \n after every pac
 cegprakash: what league are u in whadk
 whadk: yeah i mean \n after the line
 whadk: bronze
 cegprakash: check ur inputs
 cegprakash: may be u are missing to read something
 cegprakash: or try default code
 cegprakash: it should work just fine
 whadk: I'm getting a similar error to WaRiOrOfCoDe
 cegprakash: you probably have messed up something
 whadk: probably
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i' ll try that
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i mean it runs fine for few turns then i get pac_id as an input
 whadk: yeah same
 cegprakash: take a backup of ur code and try ur default code
 whadk: is the default code supposed to update when you pass a league
 whadk: mine is the same given in the wood leagues
 cegprakash: no. same code works 
 whadk: oh ok
 cegprakash: just that other pacs will not move
 cegprakash: but it won't crash
 cegprakash: take it to debug
 mark7: How to create unordered map of following.unordered_map&lt;pair&lt;point, point&gt;&gt;point is a custom class
 cegprakash: whadk u can always use error stream to debug
 whadk: I do
 whadk: sys.stderr.write
 cegprakash: mark7 u need to overload &lt; operator
 whadk: (python 3)
 cegprakash: for Point class
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d0a9ebb-7388-4c75-816b-8f1734c80fe1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d0a9ebb-7388-4c75-816b-8f1734c80fe1</a>

 cegprakash: oh may be..
 whadk: oh now i see
 cegprakash: I used &lt; for map
 cegprakash: unordered_map I'm not sure
 mark7: Maybe because point

 AntiSquid: 2k people in bronze wow
 AntiSquid: :D
 aCat: yeah, and silver in monday....

 AntiSquid: how will that help acat? you can open legend tomorrow, everything still gets flooded
 Enknable: if the boss is good
 Enknable: it will filter..
 AntiSquid: if it's good it may filter you too
 AntiSquid: back to square one
 Enknable: what u mean?
 AntiSquid: people think they get a league of their own with just a few players in it when a new league opens
 Enknable: maybe i misunderstood.I thought you meant that if you open a league everyone will just get in
 eulerscheZahl: frame 60 my first collaborative kill&#160;:)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459317850">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459317850</a>
 akshat: wow! &lt;3
 Enknable: that little red guy looks so scared :cry:
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo for general movement, full search for kills
 PiterYeh: eulerscheZahl cool, but what makes it collaborative?
 eulerscheZahl: 1 pac chasing the opponent, the other blocking the path
 eulerscheZahl: that would not work if i would move each of my pac independently
 PiterYeh: oh right, so it's frame 70, not 60
 PiterYeh: awesome, gg!!
 eulerscheZahl: it starts at 60, seeing the kill long before
 Enknable: "TRAP TRAP TRAP"
 cegprakash: it's easy to counter that akshat
 cegprakash: if he become a paper
 cegprakash: then eulerscheZahl wasted lot of turns
 cegprakash: may be trapping with all 3 can work
 cegprakash: but isn't enough 
 cegprakash: but chasing is bad
 PiterYeh: if he knows that the enemy cannot switch shape because of the ability cooldown, then it's a cerain kill with no opportunity for counterplay
 cegprakash: that's what I think
 cegprakash: oh yes the cooldown
 JohnCM: wow eulersche I just lost to your AI
 JohnCM: but i'm surprised mcts can actually run in time
 JohnCM: by my experience with ultimate tic tac toe, it can run at most 5 ply before timeout
 eulerscheZahl: i will do something about the chasing later, one thing after another
 eulerscheZahl: but true cegprakash, chasing is bad with a non-retard opponent
 eulerscheZahl: or at least risky
 eulerscheZahl: and JohnCM it's monte carlo, not MCTS
 ForceMajeure: lol <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459323211">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459323211</a>
 dbdr: the lb is full of retard opponents right now I think
 dbdr: as in ignoring death
 eulerscheZahl: of course, still early in the contest
 dbdr: I'm just getting ready for it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and my new feature partially broke the bot is i submitted a semi-finished thing :D
 eulerscheZahl: afk now
 mark7: Is there a modified version of BFS to calculate path of all pairs in map?
 wishesto: could someone explain me more about how to use ability in pac and also how to count cooldown
 ltmoran: Search for all pairs shortest path
 mark7: I get Timed out FASTER
 ltmoran: cooldown per pac is counted for you
 JohnCM: ah i see.. monte carlo for the next move
 JohnCM: awesome.. implementing rock scissors paper technique got me to 130th place
 aCat: euler what MC depth you are using currently?
 wishesto: i use if ability_cooldown == 0 then use skill but it not really work
 JohnCM: now time to use bfs... lol i've been using manhattan dist for the longest time
 Doju: How does Monte Carlo relate to this? I'm not really familiar with how it works
 Doju: or what it even really is
 wishesto: how to use skill when skill is ready
 Doju: atm i just understand that you throw a bunch of random numbers into something and get a result from it
 Csipcsirip: you move to random directions and calculate the collected pellets. you do this until timeout and then step the startmove of the best sequence
 ltmoran: Monte Carlo basically predicts with a probability where the pac should move
 wishesto: i use python thanks
 Doju: Oohh
 Doju: that's smart
 ltmoran: so like
 ltmoran: there's an 80% it should move here
 ltmoran: and 20% here
 ltmoran: The hard part is working out the percentages lol
 Doju: so it's basically like BFS but intead of getting the shortest path it gets the most pellets?
 aCat: sadly nope like that
 aCat: :P
 ltmoran: Not really
 ltmoran: It will tell you which cell you should move to
 ltmoran: And in the calculation for which is the best cell
 JohnCM: i think euler's monte carlo is purely meant to predict where his opponent would head into
 ltmoran: You can take into account num of adj pellets
 Csipcsirip: in pure MC there are no probabilities
 JohnCM: not really to collect pellets
 Doju: Ah I see
 ltmoran: "In computing, a Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm whose output may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability"
 JohnCM: you can't really monte carlo hidden information states unless you visit them
 Doju: Aha...
 Doju: okay, thanks for educating me
 Csipcsirip: you shouldnt do fully random moves tho. move to a random pellet for example
 JohnCM: and your simulation won't work cause you don't have the true figures (unless you use the overall view of the map, which you don't)
 ltmoran: Yeah but if you don't reset the board state every turn you get a lot of information wuick
 ltmoran: Every time a pac reaches an intersection, you get all the data for that row+col
 JohnCM: ya this is an information game, once you get that perspective you can get better algo
 JohnCM: think of minesweeper
 JohnCM: like my information algo without bfs can reach.. wow 100th place now
 JohnCM: XD
 ltmoran: lol
 Doju: :o
 ltmoran: Nice
 ltmoran: I think I overengineered mine...
 Doju: I have a system that might actually work
 ltmoran: And it still is not getting results
 Doju: pretty efficiently at that
 wishesto: how to use skill when skill is readyi use python thanks
 Doju: wishesto get the cooldown and if it's 0 give the command
 ltmoran: if ability_cooldown==0: print("SPEED {pacID}")
 JohnCM: my pacs are still colliding with each other and wasting a lot of moves
 JohnCM: lol gotta fix that
 ltmoran: yeah same
 Doju: I'm basically going all in on python ideologies with my bot
 ltmoran: THat's why I'm losing the games I'm losing
 Doju: even with the pellets im asking for forgiveness instead of permission
 Doju: guessing they're there unless they're not :D
 ltmoran: yeah lol
 ltmoran: That's the strat
 Doju: I think that will get me to like 400th place once it's done
 Doju: but i'm gonna try to apply some logic to also guess that some pellets are missing
 Doju: based on dead ends
 Doju: and a few other things
 Doju: Can you split a list like you would a string in python?
 Doju: Like in a similar fashion. the same syntax doesn't work
 jooha6082: open
 jooha6082: gg
 jooha6082: mid open
 Doju: ff15
 JohnCM: lol... you have to use slicing like array[i:j]
 Doju: JohnCM ugh thats ugly but i guess there's no other way to do it then
 Doju: thanks
 ltmoran: Alternatively you could join the list using "" as the delimiter and then split it based on the char you want
 Doju: Weelll i have instances of a class in the list so maybe that's a bit complicated Itmoran
 Doju: oh its ltmoran and not Itmoran
 ltmoran: You can use __repr__ 
 Doju: yeah I could technically
 ltmoran: yeah it's an L
 Doju: then use str.split
 ltmoran: yeah exactly
 Doju: I think indexing will be cleaner and faster though
 ltmoran: Yeah probably
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e68d8a9f-a1bb-4a08-8ba3-72e9eef42f0b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e68d8a9f-a1bb-4a08-8ba3-72e9eef42f0b</a>It times out in first turm?
 ltmoran: It's not like speed is a huge huge issue in thist contest 
 ltmoran: Probably because you have a quad nested loop lol
 ltmoran: You have a max of 1 second for the first turn
 ltmoran: So I imagine that loop isn't running quickly enough
 Doju: I'm using python, never underestimate python's ability to time out :D
 ltmoran: yeah I am too
 mark7: Thats why I searching for smart way to calculate distances
 ltmoran: I haven't had any issues with it yet though
 ltmoran: Remarkably
 Doju: Do you have bfs?
 ltmoran: yeah
 mark7: YES
 Doju: and how are you using it?
 ltmoran: not well&#160;:)
 mark7: BUT I Am CALCULATING EVERY PAIR
 ltmoran: You should just use heuristics
 Doju: I had bfs at first like so that i check every single pellet and compare the distances
 Doju: but that's insane and you should just use a single bfs flood fill until you hit a certain criteria
 Doju: aka the cell is a pellet
 mark7: Okay :thumbsup:
 Doju: But that won't help you if you calculate every pair
 Doju: Don't really know how to help with that
 ltmoran: every pair is what?
 ltmoran: n^3?
 Doju: hmm
 Doju: isn't it n^2
 mark7: Maybe just goto Super pellet
 mark7: :joy:
 Doju: mark7 if you really want to get every pair you could maybe optimize it with symmetry
 ltmoran: Pretty sure it isn't n^2
 Doju: how come?
 ltmoran: Floyd -warshall at least
 Doju: bfs is O(n)
 Doju: right?
 Doju: every cell is checked once
 eulerscheZahl: right
 eulerscheZahl: O(nodes+edges) in general
 eulerscheZahl: but here the edges only differs from nodes by a constant
 Nerchio: wow
 Nerchio: 10 hours later i am still top 5
 ltmoran: BFS is O(n)
 Doju: Yeah i was surprised by that as well Nerchio
 ltmoran: But there are n^2 pairs
 eulerscheZahl: resubmit and you might be lower
 Doju: a few hours ago you were still second
 Doju: ltmoran what? you check every cell for every cell
 Doju: and also you dont even need to check every cell
 Doju: you can just take the path backwards if it's already calculated
 ltmoran: Yeah
 ltmoran: But no
 eulerscheZahl: floyd warshall = O(n^3)BFS for each cell = O(n^2)
 ltmoran: It's O(n^3)
 ltmoran: Because
 ltmoran: Number of Nodes choose 2
 ltmoran: is &gt;= n^2
 ltmoran: Therefore there are n^2 pairs
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7ea1ca8e-9efc-4483-9b3d-06404efe627a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7ea1ca8e-9efc-4483-9b3d-06404efe627a</a>
 Nerchio: hahaha omg
 eulerscheZahl: that's for a full graph with lots of edges it
 ltmoran: which can each be computed in O(n) time
 ltmoran: It's a grid
 eulerscheZahl: itm [ŧab?]
 dbdr: there is a bounded number of edges
 Nerchio: i opened the first replay today and look at this
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459332968">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459332968</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's an L
 dbdr: 4 is O(1)
 ltmoran: It's not the number of edges though 
 ltmoran: It's the number of nodes
 ltmoran: That's the problem
 Nerchio: last 70 turns lol
 ltmoran: Because the n^2 comes from all pairs for each node
 eulerscheZahl: he successfully blocks you Nerchio
 eulerscheZahl: by converting to scissors it would be a draw
 Nerchio: i know but its funny
 Nerchio: close match
 Doju: Oh wow
 Doju: do some people have like hiding strats? :o
 Doju: pellet is unreachable and you are winning -&gt; hide
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure that was random
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: i mean
 Nerchio: it was for like 80 turns
 Nerchio: thats not a strat :D
 Doju: :D
 Illedan: nice kovi
 kovi: thx illedan
 kovi: shameless resubmit, to pull down romka
 akshat: Can we do recursion in c++ lambdas?
 Nerchio: i wonder if weekend will be more busy in terms of people submitting than friday
 Nerchio: probably yes
 ltmoran: yeah pretty sure you can akshat
 Clagus: are there going to be anything more than a bronze league? :P
 Nerchio: silver gold legend
 ltmoran: not for me&#160;;)
 Clagus: yeah I know in theory, but why you guys are not promoted? 
 cegprakash: my sister found a 1 line code to reach from wood2 to wood1. Always go to the last visible pellet :D 
 Nerchio: because next leagues open in the next few days :p
 Nerchio: silver on monday idk about the rest
 Clagus: ok :D
 ltmoran: Best program has got to be keep track of previously visited locations and move randomly, just not to the ones you've already been to
 ltmoran: Boo
 ltmoran: boom
 ltmoran: #1 right there
 Illedan: Not 1st. Maybe top 50.
 ltmoran: I'm joking lol
 ltmoran: Probably not top 50 either lol
 Doju: Could THAT be top 50?
 ltmoran: probably not top 500
 ltmoran: Nah lol
 ltmoran: Maybe with some modifications it could do pretty well
 Clagus: maybe top 1000, I think I'm doing something smarter and I'm around top 600 :P
 Thiesjoo: I reached top 600 with that sort of algorithm
 ltmoran: yeah
 ltmoran: With some modifications though
 ltmoran: I reckon it could do pretty well
 Thiesjoo: Now to just add enemy avoidance
 Doju: Ah im so confused
 Doju: abot negative list indexes in python
 Thiesjoo: It just counts from the end of the array right?
 Doju: like
 Doju: if you have this [::-1]
 Doju: then it just goes backwards, ok
 Doju: if you have this
 Doju: [1:3:1]
 Doju: sure, makes sense
 Doju: just like you'd expect
 Doju: but if you have [1:3:-1] it returns nothing
 ltmoran: [::-1] reverses
 ltmoran: Yeah
 ltmoran: When you specify three
 Thiesjoo: That is really weird. I don't know python good enough for that
 ltmoran: The last one is the step size
 ltmoran: So what [1:3:-1] means is
 ltmoran: start at one
 ltmoran: And go backwards
 ltmoran: eg
 ltmoran: less than one
 ltmoran: And since the start is less than the end
 ltmoran: it's going to return nothing
 Doju: ooooooooohhhhh
 Doju: i thought it was like
 Doju: grab list from 1 to 3
 Doju: then flip that backwards
 Doju: now it makes sense, thanks ltmorgan
 ltmoran: if you wanted to do that
 Doju: moran* xd
 ltmoran: it would be [1:3][::-1]
 ltmoran: np
 Doju: ummh, what if i want to go backwards and also have the 0th element included?
 Doju: so if i do [3:0:-1] it doesn't give the 0th element
 ltmoran: use -1 instead
 Doju: and [3:-1:-1] doesn't work since -1 is the last element
 Doju: [3:-1:-1]
 Doju: lol
 Doju: that's -1
 ltmoran: [3:-1:-1]?
 ltmoran: haha
 ltmoran: lol
 ltmoran: why do you need to grab it in reverse though
 ltmoran: Why not grab it normally
 Doju: and then reverse it?
 ltmoran: yeah
 Doju: well yeah i guess that works as well
 Doju: thanks again
 ltmoran: Then you don't have to mess with step size
 BenWo: wouldn't [3:1:-1] work?
 ltmoran: np
 Doju: BenWo no then it doesnt give the first two elemtns
 ltmoran: I don't think so Ben
 Doju: Oh right i can just omit the second index
 BenWo: are you wanting to have elements from 0-3&#160;?
 Doju: [3::-1], that works
 BenWo: yeah that was my next thought
 ltmoran: I still don't get 
 ltmoran: What's wrong with 
 ltmoran: [:3][::-1]
 Doju: nothing really
 ltmoran: Surely that's more readable?
 Doju: actually it's not in the context of this code
 Doju: i have a row and a column of a grid
 ltmoran: yes?
 Doju: i need lists starting from the pac to all the edges of the map
 Mentalist: 2100 people in bronze wow
 Doju: and i think it's just a bit cleaner this way
 Posejdon: 3000
 AntiSquid: shows 2895 total for me
 ltmoran: whows 2088 for me
 cegprakash: "the pac will be able to move by 2 steps during the next 5 turns"
 ltmoran: Yeah
 ltmoran: You print speed
 ltmoran: no move
 cegprakash: so I append MOVE command with same pac ID twice?
 Mentalist: yeah shots 2088 for me.CG is broken
 Beerus: any constraints for width and height/
 ltmoran: nah
 ltmoran: THe speed thing is annoying actaully
 ltmoran: so
 ltmoran: There's basically a half turn
 CodingCaptain: cegprakash no u command MOVE and it moves 2 cells
 ltmoran: But it will move your speedy pac one more square on it's originally course
 cegprakash: oh I need to print the target with distance 2 
 CodingCaptain: cegprakash yes
 ltmoran: yaeh
 ltmoran: It's a bit annoying
 ltmoran: But yeah
 TrentT: Can someone confirm if there is any way to tell the opponents pac types? (Rock, paper, scissors)
 ltmoran: yes
 dbdr: it's in the input TrentT
 ltmoran: It's given to you
 TrentT: Okay thanks, I see that now
 cegprakash: does anyone know what's the singular form for Scissors?
 TrentT: AutomatonNN what is singular for scissors?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by that?
 TrentT: Automaton3000 can you help?
 ltmoran: It's plural
 ltmoran: types are ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
 ltmoran: all caps
 cegprakash: but I want to use singular
 cegprakash: for my type
 cegprakash: because Rock and Paper are singular
 cegprakash: I want to keep it uniform
 ltmoran: yeah but that's silly
 ltmoran: Because
 ltmoran: THe type that's given in the input is plural
 ltmoran: so why change it?
 ltmoran: Singular of SCISSORS is SCISSOR btw
 cegprakash: I read somewhere scissors has no singular form
 ltmoran: Why does it matter though?
 ltmoran: You want it singular
 ltmoran: just take off the S
 ltmoran: It doesn't actualyl have to exist
 cegprakash: but when I want to borrow a scissor should I ask "Do you have a scissors?"
 ltmoran: you should say
 ltmoran: would you care to pass me your double-bladed cutting implement for a short period of time
 Doju: my vision thing is finally done
 Doju: after all it was only like 20 lines but still it was a pain
 cegprakash: okay I'll name it DOUBLE_BLADED_CUTTER
 cegprakash: this resolves the confusion
 MSmits: wow, your bots must be awesome that you got to the point of making sure your code is spelled correctly :P
 cegprakash: solid foundation is important
 MSmits: allright
 dbdr: I just got to the point of having the hard talk with my bot
 dbdr: he knows about death now&#160;:(
 MSmits: ahh I see
 shashwat986:&#160;:( that's a tough stage to be at. 
 MSmits: should i do this before or after a search to optimize routes
 shashwat986: Ah, I was a parent once
 shashwat986: now my pacs are running around eating everyone in sight
 Doju: This is still pretty ugly but oh well
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/01610c78-af1d-407f-958f-97c23706bd41">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/01610c78-af1d-407f-958f-97c23706bd41</a>
 dbdr: I think it's pretty orthogonal MSmits
 shashwat986: i need to have a different talk with them. moderation
 dbdr: you need both
 MSmits: ah ok
 Illedan: My bot thinks of the afterlife
 MSmits: Doju
 MSmits: it's indices
 Doju: Thanks
 dbdr: but might depend on your data structures
 Doju: right
 dbdr: good to give it a little thought in advance
 Doju: Gotta make sure the grammar in my comments is correct
 Doju: priorities :DD
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr about being mortal or about committing murder?
 dbdr: being mortal
 dbdr: my bot is a pacifist
 dbdr: only kills by ignorance
 eulerscheZahl: mine is evil
 <b>**dbdr is not surprised</b></p><p><img src="/a/39427621192030" /> <b>**shashwat986 can do that? whoa</b></p><p><img src="/a/16222515698472" /> Illedan: I had to disable kill mode. It was worse :P
 MSmits: I think I'm gonna make mine evil first and then do the search
 Illedan: Chasing a pac loses a lot of turns
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: :peace:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459317850">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459317850</a>frame 60-70
 shashwat986: what do you guys feel about having different strategies for different pacs?
 shashwat986: worth it? not worth it?
 Doju: shashwat986 interesting
 Doju: but make them cooperate
 Nerchio: chasing pacs is worth it guys
 Nerchio: you can show you are a tougher guy
 Illedan: I like that stra euler
 MSmits: Illedan, you could put more heuristic on your kill mode to estimate loss of time
 Illedan: I score a kill the same as picking 1 seen pellet :P 
 dbdr: need to implement pinky, blinky, clyde, etc&#160;:)
 Nerchio: nice one euler&#160;:)
 dbdr: inky is the 4th
 Doju: Oh you have trapping strats 
 Doju: that's so cool 
 dbdr: at least we kno the boss names :D
 eulerscheZahl: who will be the gold boss? Mrs pacman?
 dbdr: should be a ghost I think
 cegprakash: talking about gold already?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Tentacle_Ghost">https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Tentacle_Ghost</a>
 dbdr: well, the real contest starts in legend
 eulerscheZahl: i thought there were only 4
 dbdr: need to talk about sth before that
 dbdr: 4 in the original
 ltmoran: There's Inky, blinky, pinky, sue
 ltmoran: I think lol
 cegprakash: I think inky pinky ponky father has a donkey
 Doju: Uhh do you guys think it's smart to have a probability that the pellet is eaten value for each cell?
 eulerscheZahl: and one of them was bugged, targeting the wrong cell
 Illedan: Sure Doju
 MSmits: makes sense Doju
 dbdr: yes, because of overflow or sth like that :D
 Doju: Alright. that's next on the list after i get these things done then
 eulerscheZahl: for now i just have 0.99^(turn-lastSeen)
 cegprakash: mostly bronze boss is a ponky and silver boss is a donkey
 dbdr: pellets rot with time
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl do 0.99 * (200 + lastSeen - turn)
 MSmits: cheaper
 MSmits: or something like that anyway
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: is that some performance hint again?
 MSmits: no Math.pow
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care
 wlesavo: hm, my last seen only concerns opponent pacs rn
 dbdr: an exponential can be done as a simple multiplication
 MSmits: I know, I am just trolling
 eulerscheZahl: and if i feel i have to get it faster, i cache it
 dbdr: just use the previous value
 kovi: i do turn by turn multiple
 Nerchio: i dont consider probability yet :joy:
 the_joker_100: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459368010">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459368010</a>
 the_joker_100: any way to  avoid this&#160;??
 the_joker_100: any tips???
 MSmits: dont speed :P
 MSmits: just grab the super and go
 eulerscheZahl: you are running into the opponent paper with your stone. of course this is avoidable
 ltmoran: Joker
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd death
 ltmoran: To stop bashing
 the_joker_100: i have not even thought bout combat yet
 ltmoran: avoid bashing
 the_joker_100: i just cant avoid striking one of my own
 the_joker_100: lmao
 MSmits: the tip is to think about combat then&#160;:)
 wlesavo: lol
 MSmits: I am going to try that today
 Nerchio: remember when doing fighting simulation don't use Math.pow
 the_joker_100: i got this problem where my own pacs run into each other and i cant find a way to detect that??
 MSmits: lol
 the_joker_100: my mid is goin crazy
 the_joker_100: mid*
 MSmits: KaPOW!
 ltmoran: lol
 MSmits: the_joker_100, maybe stomach flu
 wlesavo: MSmits did somebody from your ai class joined?
 MSmits: yes Thiesjoo
 the_joker_100: @MSmits what??lmao
 MSmits: not my AI class btw it's physics
 the_joker_100: mind*
 MSmits: he's in my colleagues CS class
 wlesavo: MSmits i meant your class where you are learning, not teaching
 MSmits: ohh
 the_joker_100: i entered top 600 hot damn
 Nerchio: so you can't see enemy speed turns left ye?
 ltmoran: I think you can?
 wlesavo: wait what
 MSmits: doubt it. It's a very small class, few students and they're all older and busy with other stuff in their life. They could barely finish the first assignment in time, wheras I finished all in 4 days
 wlesavo: Nerchio i didnt checked that, just assumed i can, is there 0 on the input?
 Nerchio: i think you can too
 Nerchio: but somebody said you cant
 Nerchio: and its faster to ask in chat xD
 ltmoran: Well it's give isn't it?
 MSmits: would be sad if you couldnt
 MSmits: that would make the game more random
 MSmits: but all you really need to know is whether the pac is speeding or not. You can guess the speedturns left from the cooldown. Unless that is also hidden
 cegprakash: if I print 5,5 as target from 4,4 will I move to 5,4 first or 4,5 first?
 Nerchio: ok i debugged it you can see it
 MSmits: dont think that is possible cegprakash
 Nerchio: i just wish the description would be more clear
 MSmits: I didnt see any 2 by 2 areas on a map
 MSmits: generator probably doesnt make them
 Nerchio: in almost every game there is a problem with description what info you get about opponent
 MSmits: but anyway, at some point you really should not rely on referee pathfinding
 cegprakash: MSmits cool then
 MSmits: that is meant for starters
 Nerchio: you also get information about their ability cooldown btw
 cegprakash: so if RIGHT_DOWN is a valid move then DOWN_RIGHT will never be a valid move
 wlesavo: Nerchio also just checked that
 MSmits: The only weird think about pathing I found was that there is no way to go back and forth on a dead end and end on the same turn you started
 MSmits: same cell that is
 Nerchio: yea you need to go 1 sqm
 Doju: Okay vision is semi-done now
 Nerchio: wlesavo i see what you did there
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459375929">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459375929</a>
 Nerchio: 16-17 :p
 cegprakash: wait what we can't do a DOWN_UP
 cegprakash: oh yes
 MSmits: allright no more chatting. Rest of the day is coding. I want to try and get a search and fight mode this weekend if I can
 cegprakash: makes sense
 cegprakash: yeah me too
 ltmoran: yeah me too
 ltmoran: except I won't be able to&#160;;)
 wlesavo: Nerchio :slight_smile:
 Nerchio: i feel like at the very top there might be a lot of stalling
 Nerchio: nobody wants to switch etc
 ltmoran: Can't you just keep the code that you submitted that got you into 3rd or seomthing
 ltmoran: then try something new
 ltmoran: then if it doesn't work
 ltmoran: resubmit your old code?
 wlesavo: sure you can
 the_joker_100: can anyone tell me how to detect whether my own 2 pacs are goin to collide???
 the_joker_100: pls????
 Nerchio: looks like i need to start working on the rock/paper/scissors more
 Nerchio: you guys are getting trickier :D
 ltmoran: Check if the position of your pacs remained the same for two turns in a row
 ltmoran: if so
 cegprakash: have a collision target map the_joker_100
 ltmoran: They are stuck
 ltmoran: then do something about it
 the_joker_100: what??
 shashwat986: is anyone caching the paths between two points? It's timing out for me
 cegprakash: don't let two of ur pacs go to same location the_joker_100
 the_joker_100: yeah i did check that @cegprakash
 the_joker_100: but sometime even if they dont intend to go to smae square they do collide 
 mark7: the_joker_100 Check for 2 cells not one
 the_joker_100: @mark7 could u explain?
 ltmoran: Joker
 ltmoran: If
 ltmoran: You maintain the last positions of your pacs
 ltmoran: for two turns
 ltmoran: then you check if they haven't moved for two turns
 mark7: may be they are two cells away so check wether a pac is near 2 cells
 ltmoran: then you can reverse them or something
 the_joker_100: so i need a history of where my pacs have been to?
 cegprakash: 1) don't go to same cell on same turn, 2) don't go towards same target on same cell. These two should guarantee u don't colllide
 cegprakash: *same turn
 Doju: oh nice! vision works
 Doju: and it's not even that slow
 ltmoran: What sort of win:loss ratio is good for the past battles? 
 ltmoran: Or does that not matter at all?
 cegprakash: ltmoran u need like 65% against like all opponents
 ltmoran: For what score?
 cegprakash: even if u lose 80% against 1 or 2 opponents u won't climb the ladder LelouchVC2
 ltmoran: oh yeah
 ltmoran: Well i'm winning like 70-80%
 ltmoran: And I'm stuck at around 200-300
 cegprakash: yeah that means u have &lt; 50% win rate at 200-300
 ltmoran: oh ok
 ltmoran: So
 ltmoran: What it means is
 ltmoran: oh ok
 ltmoran: thanks
 cegprakash: and ur rank improves if u have a profile picture
 ChooJeremy: lol
 ltmoran: hmm
 ltmoran: I see
 ltmoran: Makes sense&#160;;)
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl do topcoder SRM tonight at 9:30 PM
 cegprakash: that's IST
 cegprakash: like 6 hours from now
 Nerchio: your rank improves if you have a profile picture than antisquid likes
 Doju: Noow we're talking
 Nerchio: that*
 Doju: non-blind pacs are much better than blind pacs :D
 shashwat986: Nerchio&#160;!!
 shashwat986: Are you caching the paths between two points?
 Nerchio: no
 shashwat986: hm
 Nerchio: but i have very efficient path algo
 Nerchio: working on ints so i can do it every turn
 shashwat986: oh, that's a good idea
 Nerchio: even in java :joy:
 shashwat986: let me try to do the same thing
 shashwat986: yeah, same boat. I'm on ruby
 Doju: Is there any way to overlay something on the game?
 Doju: it'd be reeally handy to see what my pacs are seeing
 Nerchio: which one would you guys prefer to read
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7b7773f1-f293-48ef-b856-01097da15291">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7b7773f1-f293-48ef-b856-01097da15291</a>
 Nerchio: 1 or 2
 ltmoran: 1 for me
 the_joker_100: im much comfortable with 2
 shashwat986: 1
 Nerchio: i prefer 1 ofcourse but maybe it's hard to read for some :p
 jrke: 1 for me also
 the_joker_100: i just dont have the habit of no 1
 cegprakash: 1
 BenWo: I like 1
 the_joker_100: im the only noob here
 Nerchio: yeah in my first contest i was writing 2 all the time but 1 feels so much better for me now
 shashwat986: i think 2 is clearer if you have even one more condition
 cegprakash: we have all been there the_joker_100
 shashwat986: for 2 conditions, 1 is clear enough
 Nerchio: i feel like simplifying if statements is important in the challenges
 ltmoran: yeah
 Nerchio: otherwise you spend a lot of time debugging later
 ltmoran: i agree
 ltmoran: otherwise your code just piles up
 RockyMullet: woah hoyl mother of drift, I was 50th yesterday and I'm now 24th
 RockyMullet: no way I can resubmit haha
 Nerchio: you will have to resubmit sooner or later RockyMullet
 Nerchio: might as well do it now :D
 RockyMullet: I'm over euler when he was like 6th yesterday, this cant be right
 RockyMullet: Nerchio I know, I just wanna believe I'm good for a moment haha
 RockyMullet: A little lie to help self esteem
 Nerchio: euler is working on some nasty traps of pacs :D
 dbdr: it's as if this game had a RPS component&#160;;)
 Nerchio: he posted it earlier
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459317850">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459317850</a> 
 Nerchio: 60-70 :D
 BenWo: alrighty, bronze league. now the work begins
 wlesavo: lol its a trap
 shashwat986: My first move is taking 978ms XD
 BenWo: lol yikes
 RockyMullet: shashwat986 no waste&#160;!&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: Yesterday i was rank 400 and now with the same code i am rtank 1200. What's going on here
 ltmoran: people are learning
 ltmoran: A lot
 ltmoran: annoyingly
 Thiesjoo: And fast
 ltmoran: yeah
 AntiSquid: lol
 Doju: Indeed
 ltmoran: that's the bad bit
 mark7: shashwat986 what you do that much
 Thiesjoo: I saw euler laying traps
 Doju: euler's traps are freaking amazing
 shashwat986: I am trying to precache all paths between all points on the map
 AntiSquid: no ... all the bots below rank 400 aren't even taking all game rules into consideration
 shashwat986: it's not happening
 RockyMullet: shashwat986 I do that, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one, what language are you using&#160;?
 mark7: shashwat986 I am trying the that but I get times out
 Doju: my bot gets absolutely demolished by euler's
 Doju: 126 to 26
 Thiesjoo: I had 120 vs 100
 Thiesjoo: So im doing better
 ltmoran: How can I play Euler's?
 Doju: you delete the default ai
 Thiesjoo: Delete default ai and add Euler
 ltmoran: How do I do that?
 Doju: okay now it was 162-110
 Nerchio: he's abusing code that crashed in ide
 Nerchio: crashes*
 shashwat986: RockyMullet what language do you use? I'm using ruby
 Doju: Oh huh i haven't played against myself yet
 Doju: this'll be interesting
 ltmoran: lol
 RockyMullet: oh ok, im using C++, so maybe the problem is not the algo
 ltmoran: How do I delete the default AI
 Doju: ltmoran you click "DELETE" :D
 ltmoran: lol
 ltmoran: I guessed that might be the case
 Doju: It went 142-118
 ltmoran: Except I can't find the delete button
 Doju: below the ai
 Thiesjoo: Set your IDE to advanced mode
 Doju: at the bottom
 Doju: oh rightt there's that
 Thiesjoo: In settings in the left bar
 shashwat986: RockyMullet you're storing the best PATH between every two points?
 ltmoran: ah cheers
 shashwat986: or just the distance?
 Nerchio: nerchio vs nerchio is pretty hilarous
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459409055">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459409055</a>
 ltmoran: Had to change the IDE type
 Nerchio: i can't ever win against myself
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459409397">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459409397</a>shashwat986
 Doju: Don't you have any randomness in your ai?
 Nerchio: no why would i do that in this game
 Nerchio: randomness means you don't know which move is better and in ideal situation you should always know
 Doju: hm, fair enough
 shashwat986: Doju randomness makes it very hard to debug as well, because the pacs' behaviour aren't reproducible
 RockyMullet: maybe I'm dumb but I cant find it in the statement, how to do I make pacs write debug text over there head&#160;?
 shashwat986: add it to the end of the command
 Doju: You just add it after the command RockyMullet
 shashwat986: MOVE 0 1 2 MSG
 RockyMullet: shashwat986 I'm storing the distance and the first move to do to get tehre
 RockyMullet: oooh thanks guys
 Doju: okayyy time to implement speeding up
 Doju: maybe that'll push me up the ladder a bit
 RockyMullet: with a bfs
 cguzman: @Nerchio what approach are you following?
 Nerchio: get more pellets than your opponent :neutral_face:
 Thiesjoo: Wow that is a good strategy.
 ltmoran: I wish I'd thought of that
 Doju: there are sooo many things i could still do...
 Doju: i don't even acknowledge the enemies atm
 Thiesjoo: My todolist is pretty large
 Thiesjoo: I now know if i will die from the enemy, but what now?
 Thiesjoo: Fleeing is an option
 RockyMullet: run or switch
 cguzman: Why didn't I think in that? I was just walking through the maze. Very smart @Nerchio
 wlesavo: let your eval decide
 NormantasStankevicius: 2100 people in bronze &gt;.&gt;
 BenWo: I just made it to bronze. All my code does is move all of the pacs towards pellets.
 ltmoran: hmm
 ltmoran: I have a 500 char line
 ltmoran: I should probably fix that
 Doju: BenWo yup that gets you to bronze
 wlesavo: oh, the bogol guy submitted, i though i saw the avatar somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: i'll follow him and submit too
 Nerchio: who is bogol
 eulerscheZahl: and i crashed
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 wlesavo: blame him for this eulerscheZahl
 wlesavo: Nerchio it is a quite interesting game in contributions\
 cguzman: is there a tutorial to configure all this in an IDE?
 eulerscheZahl: i think that's the closest to what you are asking for: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 eulerscheZahl: of course there are other ways, i just describe with i'm doing
 ZeroByter: When u move with speed, in order to actually use speed u gotta MOVE 2 cells away, right?
 aCat: yep
 aCat: 2 or more
 eulerscheZahl: yes. and both have to be free
 Doju: that's suuch a pain
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 ZeroByter: Hmmm
 ZeroByter: Trying to use speed but it's not working, but it's not a bug or something, I gotta fix it
 Doju: eulerscheZahl atm my bot just searches for the closest pellet using BFS
 Doju: but to make that work i have to do the same BFS on the first pellet
 AntiSquid: feeding AutomatonNN euler lines :o
 AutomatonNN:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: don't act innocent AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: so if i want to work in the players that i saw it in the replay there
 shashwat986: did it!
 shashwat986: I've been able to pre-cache all paths from all points
 Doju: nice, how long does it take?
 shashwat986: had to use the fact that the map is symmetrical. Now to re-write all my wrapper functions
 shashwat986: 484ms. 
 shashwat986: half of what it was taking earlier
 Doju: so just about half of the original time
 shashwat986: yeah
 RockyMullet: nice
 ZeroByter: Oh man I haven't even checked what is my execution time lol
 whadk: can other people see debug messages you put on your pac
 Doju: i think they can
 whadk: oh ok
 Nerchio: they can on the screen but they can't read them from input 
 Doju: ugh implementing the 2-long movement is going to be suuch a pain
 whadk: why do you need bfs to find the nearest pellet out of curiousity?
 Doju: seriously what
 Doju: how do you even do it
 ZeroByter: Just so I get this straight. When u have speed (and assuming u use it correctly), u r supposed to move across 2 cells at a time?
 Doju: yup
 ZeroByter: Weird
 ZeroByter: Not doing it for me
 Doju: when there are pellets next to my pacs they only move 1 cell at a time even with speed&#160;:(
 BenWo: can you just ignore the immediately adjacent cells when they have speed?
 wlesavo: not really
 BenWo: I mean in his pathfinding
 Doju: what if there's nothing to get outside of the immediately adjacent cells
 RockyMullet: or time to ruin all that nice drifting with a resubmit
 BenWo: well... either the game ends before then, or you didn't need to use speed at that point
 RockyMullet: I just take a last look at it... before I have to let it go :cry:
 Doju: hkm
 Doju: my rank actually dropped by 600
 Doju: when i turned speeding on
 RockyMullet: you need to be moving by 2 cells otherwise you are just wasting a turn
 Doju: yup
 eulerscheZahl: what if there is a last pellet in the corner?
 eulerscheZahl: don't pick it up?!
 RockyMullet: well then you can waste a turn :P
 BenWo: if there's one pellet left, and you're next to it, just grab it instead of using speed
 BenWo: it costs a turn to activate speed anyway, right?
 Doju: well yeah
 BenWo: so using speed is only faster for pellets 4+ cells away 
 Doju: isn't it 3?
 BenWo: it might be 3, I'm not sure how the turns are calculated
 Doju: hmm yeha
 Doju: that might be smart
 Doju: except that... no
 Doju: xd
 BenWo: if the pac just moves 2 squares on one turn, then cell 3 would be simultaneous for with and without speed
 Doju: that's gonna be messy to implement for me
 Doju: so i'm just gonna do another round of pathfinding
 Doju: from the closest pellet
 BenWo: sounds good enough&#160;:)
 BenWo: I'm better at thinking this stuff than actually programming it, lol
 Doju: that's kinda good though, isn't it?
 BenWo: not in a contest, lol
 Doju: no lines of codes is better than some lines of code
 Doju: if they achieve the same result
 BenWo: hah, that's true
 Doju: there has to be a better way to do this...
 Doju: oh, maybe just check if the neighbors of the pellet are also a pellet
 Doju: and the path is linear
 akshat: I
 akshat: I'm not sure how to implement BFS in this, should I find the most profitable route for each pac assuming pellets at unexplored area or just find it for nearby cells upto depth 5? Need some guidance here please.
 MadKnight: akshat u should find a way how to find your opp
 Doju: Hm... I'm currently just assuming there are pellets everywhere unless i see they aren't there
 Doju: and pathfinding to the imaginary pellets
 MadKnight: how to fight your opp i mean
 Doju: or actually, superposition-pellets :D
 MadKnight: u gotta beat him and not just collect stuff
 Doju: wdym, i'm a pacifist
 MadKnight: make problems for him
 akshat: Okay...
 Doju: maybe he is too
 Doju: _p
 Doju: :P*
 MadKnight: fix your p
 Doju: :p
 Doju: Okayyy now i have pathfinding on pathfinding
 Doju: lets see if this helps
 MadKnight: why do u have it on it&#160;?
 BenWo: so you can find your way to the path?
 Doju: MadKnight because I want to utilize the speed
 Doju: my old thing was just pathing to the nearest pellet
 Doju: and if it was next to the pac, the speed was useless
 Doju: now i'm getting the closest pellet to the closest pellet
 Doju: (which, by no means is perfect)
 AntiSquid: MadKnight how's your bot? i have 10 lines of C++ at #571
 NormantasStankevicius: you mean take the cloest pellet near you xd?
 Doju: NormantasStankevicius not really. I'm first finding the closest pellet to the pac and then finding the pellet closest to that
 Doju: that rhymed
 the_joker_100: uhhhhhhhh
 NormantasStankevicius: uhhhhhhhhhh
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid you can do the same with 5 lines of ruby
 Doju: uhhhhhhhhhhhh
 BenWo: huh
 NormantasStankevicius: that is a way doju tbh
 NormantasStankevicius: right now I have a simple path
 NormantasStankevicius: testing what is better for now closest pellet or most valuable pellet, but I will need to thing of a way
 eulerscheZahl: almost 3k players already :o
 aCat: 2.1k in bronze ;p
 eulerscheZahl: quick poll to the new players here: how did you find CodinGame? friends? forum post? ...?
 NormantasStankevicius: eulerschezahl, while that is great, it's quite scary also, this competition might be a meat grinder
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: 2pac or not 2pac?
 Automaton2000: looks the same as in the game
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/kpf26qy">https://imgur.com/kpf26qy</a>
 Doju: why is id different? and it's throwing an error
 NormantasStankevicius: Doju is that python?
 Doju: yes, python
 Doju: i just changed their order.. that used to work
 AntiSquid: the instafluff streamer has a lot of viewers
 Doju: Oh its a function
 eulerscheZahl: that instafluff used to be "TheSauce"
 eulerscheZahl: first appearance in fantastic bits i think
 eulerscheZahl: then he left
 AntiSquid: maybe this contest does beat the accountant in participation count
 NormantasStankevicius: AntiSquid just opened his streams, looks professional
 AntiSquid: really?
 AntiSquid: i think there's too much going on on his screen
 aCat: link?
 Gh0stm4chine: yeah link please&#160;?
 AntiSquid: clouds and teddies and god knows what else, way too cluttered for my taste
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff/videos">https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff/videos</a>
 aCat: thx
 AntiSquid: no offence to the guy though
 NormantasStankevicius: Antisquid true
 aCat: omg
 aCat: unwatchable
 AntiSquid: idk i skipped through it like usually, there's few good points he makes
 Doju: oh wait this is recursive now...
 aCat: I believe so, but watching is too much
 AntiSquid: i remember thibaud asking on discord which streamers do we like / follow
 AntiSquid: if they like one of the really big guys they kill the website :D
 eulerscheZahl: i muted the streaming channel on discord
 aCat: I like to take a look on thibpaut from time to time
 aCat: never tried to watch clashes :P
 Doju: yeah doing 2x pathfinding works pretty well NormantasStankevicius
 AntiSquid: is life really not worth anything to you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: watching clashes @_@
 aCat: 'never tried'
 aCat:&#160;?
 Uljahn: watching someone clashing in c++ could be fun though
 aCat: bleh I imagine shortest code in Java ;p
 eulerscheZahl: only if the neighbor's cat suddenly enters the house :D
 AntiSquid: or if they get a random burglar during stream:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTGfzq2UNlU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTGfzq2UNlU</a>
 akshat: Do you guys create totally new instances of your pacs and pellets array or just create once in the start and then update them?
 akshat: What is preferable?
 Doju: Pacs are new instances, pellets inbedded into the grid
 Doju: for me
 Doju: imbedded*
 akshat: Okay..
 the_joker_100: how do i check which one of my pacs sees an enemy??
 Doju: Might change it so that i create pacs only once though
 Doju: its getting kinda messy
 anid: makes sense to create pacs only once, so that you can store all of the information that a pac sees easily
 anid: and its previous target
 Doju: yup
 RockyMullet: the_joker_100 if an enemy pac in in the input, one of your pac sees it
 the_joker_100: but which one sees it??
 RockyMullet: you can make a line of sight check after that
 Doju: the_joker_100 you might want to do something like i did
 the_joker_100: what did u do?
 RockyMullet: just travel in 4 direction until you find a wall, thats your pac's line of sight
 Doju: my pac class has a method that returns cells that are visible to it
 the_joker_100: kk
 the_joker_100: that would be really helpful 
 the_joker_100: ty
 RockyMullet: you can use the same thing to determine which of your pacs sees pellets
 the_joker_100: kk 
 the_joker_100: yeaaaaaah
 the_joker_100: damn dint even think of that
 RockyMullet: so the pac on the other side of the map doesnt travel all the way there, making all your pacs staying together, which is not good
 Doju: RockyMullet that's exactly what i'm doing
 Doju: no more phantom pellets
 RockyMullet: good good
 Doju: this actually seems to be working super well
 RockyMullet: my pellet gathering still sucks, but that change made it way better
 Bastett: Ugh. I should read harder. I assumed pac id was unique, not unique per team.
 RockyMullet: Bastett yeah same hahaha, was confused by all the bugs it created
 Doju: This is silly
 Doju: my pacs leave the last one or two pellets at dead ends untouched
 735487: wow i see some bug <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/iStXdza">https://imgur.com/a/iStXdza</a>. I won but shown as second
 BenWo: ok out for now, later
 Doju: cycya
 eulerscheZahl: amurushkin the avatars above the game are different too
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes it happens that it loads a different game than the one you selected
 Doju: slightly wonky speeding apparently gets me to rank 600
 735487: ah did not see that avatars different. anyway it looks cool&#160;:)
 Doju: i wondwer ow much how much it'll improve if i fix it
 Bastett: noice, down goes Blinky
 Bastett: with my rather naive "find the closest food" strategy
 Clagus: gj Bastett
 Clagus: guys do you know if I can try my code in some other way than through web ide? I'm so sick of keeping all my code in one file... I would like to have multiple files, nicely split code, but then it would be hard to copy-paste it to web ide and run or submit
 Bastett: I've written a little bash script to build my source files into one
 Bastett: it's one line of bash
 Bastett: find src/ -name obj -prune -o -name bin -prune -o -name '*.cs' -exec cat {} \; &gt; game.cs
 Clagus: oh, ok, I thought it would be harder to do that
 Bastett: that ones finds all .cs files in src/ excluding bin/ and obj and compiles into game.cs
 Clagus: sick
 Clagus: :D
 Clagus: so i should run it in my solution folder?
 eulerscheZahl: you can add usings anywhere in the code, not only at the top?
 mark7: close fight eulerscheZahl <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459468906">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459468906</a> May be a bit better pellet searching algo and I will be in top 50
 eulerscheZahl: i'm coding in C# for many years, why didn't I know about that?
 Bastett: for c#, usings would need to go inside the namespace declaration of each file
 mark7: MY current submit improved My rank by 1000
 Bastett: otherwise you'll get duplicate usings, and they'll fail to compile
 Doju: mark7 woah, what did you do?
 mark7: I rewrote whole code
 eulerscheZahl: i see. i don't even define a namespace
 Doju: oh i see haha
 mark7: first in c++ then delete that wrote again in java
 eulerscheZahl: and my bundler removes duplicate usings
 Clagus: the file was created but is empty...
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a C# project Clagus?
 PiterYeh: eulerscheZahl what are you using for bundling? I'm coding in visual studio but i have just one big file
 mark7: in java writing to error string takes to much time
 Clagus: yes :D
 mark7: There are scripts available for java
 Clagus: i'm not that dumb xD
 eulerscheZahl: a bit of python PiterYeh, i run it as a post-build event
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/555910f7-2f09-426c-84e1-23e7cb2c2944">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/555910f7-2f09-426c-84e1-23e7cb2c2944</a>
 PiterYeh: noice
 PiterYeh: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: next question Clagus: windows or linux?
 Clagus: windows
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure if the code will work then
 Clagus: yeah, it seems not
 Bastett: you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux
 Bastett: or write the same thing in Powershell or Linqpad or whatever
 eulerscheZahl: you can install a linux
 Clagus: yeah i will try it in powershell
 mark7: Or just modify the code alittle bit
 dbdr: always a good idea to install linux&#160;:)
 Clagus: thanks for the tip anyway&#160;:)
 dbdr: that said, a python script should work on windows, maybe needs some minor change
 mark7: Yeah use linux
 dbdr: if eulerscheZahl coded in a dirty way&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i was referring to the batch command not working
 Bastett: Python isn't my friend. I got so frustrated with virtual environments, and py2/3 incompatibilities
 eulerscheZahl: find src/ -name obj -prune -o -name bin -prune -o -name '*.cs' -exec cat {} \; &gt; game.cs
 Bastett: I'm sure it's better now, but it annoyed me
 dbdr: oh, sorry, thought it was a pure python script
 AntiSquid: how many people will promote i wonder
 eulerscheZahl: mine is
 AntiSquid: will they still got for the around 50%&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but Clagus tried the bash from Bastett
 Bastett: this chat needs threads like Slack or something :P
 eulerscheZahl: CG doesn't want to make players sad, now that we got so many
 eulerscheZahl: i predict a large silver
 AntiSquid: you can have separate chat rooms, create as many as you want #chat_name .... #another_chat
 dbdr: I dunno, CG systematically overreacts
 AntiSquid: just cleak any of those Bastett
 eulerscheZahl: and usually there's much less activity on the chat
 dbdr: bronze is large, they might be a #50 boss now :D
 AntiSquid: lol not in bronze
 AntiSquid: uness they want to kill the contest
 dbdr: exagerating
 RockyMullet: the bronze boss is usually pretty noob friendly
 eulerscheZahl: jupoulton at 250 right now
 eulerscheZahl: will drop a bit till monday
 dbdr: but did you notice: super easy wood bosses in OOC -&gt; super hard in pac2020
 Nerchio: you mean the opposite? :p
 dbdr: super fast decay of COC CPs, =&gt; super slow
 AntiSquid: :D
 dbdr: etc
 AntiSquid: wood supposed to be easy&#160;!?
 dbdr: I did mean the opposite&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know the date for the next contest yet
 mark7: frame 14 looks like my bot don't like supper pellets <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459477995">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459477995</a>
 RockyMullet: wood was only "hard" because the servers were slow and people wouldnt get promoted, so you would fight way harder opponents than the boss
 dbdr: probably 2 weeks after this one, at this rate&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: what? why
 dbdr: or 2 years
 dbdr: well this one is very close to OOC
 RockyMullet: from what I understand OOC was not planned
 dbdr: I know
 RockyMullet: still way better than the overlapping ones
 dbdr: overlapping?
 RockyMullet: yeah, like at the same time
 AntiSquid: those were hidden
 dbdr: when was that?
 RockyMullet: like HS and the accountent
 AntiSquid: oh&#160;?
 dbdr: I wasn't born at that time
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 Gh0stm4chine: guys, what's considered a good ranking currently in bronze&#160;? 
 RockyMullet: Let me tell you the story boi *rock the rocking chair rocking a mullet*
 AntiSquid: top 100 Gh0stm4chine&#160;?
 dbdr: :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459479956">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459479956</a>interesting starting constellation. you can't escape with 100% certainty
 RockyMullet: no I lie I dont want tell it lol
 cegprakash: ppl in bronze are improving so fast
 RockyMullet: The Accountant started before HS ended, thats it
 <b>**eulerscheZahl skipped TAC, no time</b></p><p><img src="/a/2188810577879" /> Gh0stm4chine: AntiSquid, top 100 is gold&#160;? or depends&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: depends obv
 AntiSquid: but you asked about bot strength&#160;? what a decent bot is&#160;?
 RockyMullet: so did I, HS was my second contest, so I went ultra tryhard, like going to bed at 4am etc, so I didnt have the energy for it
 eulerscheZahl: i remember how you tried at HS
 RockyMullet: AND FAILED
 RockyMullet: haha
 eulerscheZahl: and thinking that your bot was a good killer
 RockyMullet: I just coded fast so I was #1 early
 RockyMullet: then actual good bot shown up :P
 eulerscheZahl: but now you know that an early lead means nothing
 anid: Surprising that already 3000 people have joined
 RockyMullet: yes, life has broken my optimism since
 eulerscheZahl: 2975
 RockyMullet: I seen some sponsored ad on FB about the contest, first time I see that, maybe CG poored more money in advertising this time
 anid: And already more than 70% Are in Bronze
 AntiSquid: but why did they advertise this so much&#160;?
 AntiSquid: there's no special sponsor or somesuch
 RockyMullet: probably because they are now trying to have less contests
 RockyMullet: but bigger ones
 AntiSquid: sounds ok
 RockyMullet: im just guessing here
 RockyMullet: yay last submit got me to 34th :D progress&#160;!
 dbdr: confinement also helps probably
 dbdr: and the prizes
 dbdr: and marketing indeed
 RockyMullet: yeah makes sense
 Doju: I'm not sure whether I should be making my code robust to human error
 dbdr: also people learned about this one during OOC
 RockyMullet: I think the company / school leaderboard must help for some peer pressure too
 Doju: or fix the human errors
 dbdr: true
 dbdr: it's a good addition
 Bastett: yeah I got into this in Ocean of Code via work chatter
 AntiSquid: do companies want the personalized glass that much&#160;?
 Doju: because atm my pacs are just defaulting to going to the middle because their pathfinding returns  None
 AntiSquid: wroclaw winning a CG glass ... put it in the hallway as decoration lol
 cegprakash: [CG]Thibaud our company logo and website needs to be updated on leaderboard
 cegprakash: I have emailed u [CG]Thibaud
 anid: cegprakash are there others in pandocorp playing?
 Bastett: I assume we're restricted to a single core on these simulations. I've not tried any multithreading. Is there documentation about that anywhere?
 cegprakash: they might play anid
 anid:&#160;:) Get in top 10!!!
 Clagus: so I made a script in powershell to copy all .cs files to one big .txt file:get-content *.cs | out-file bigBadFile.txt
 cegprakash: sure
 eulerscheZahl: yes, single core
 eulerscheZahl: and you are paused during your opponent's turn
 AntiSquid: there are 2 wood players from pandocorp, they are not your alts cegprakash are they&#160;?
 Bastett: @clagus you'll probably want to exclude ob/ otherwise you might end up with AssemblyInfo.cs (unless you're only searching in the current directory)
 Bastett: obj/ that is
 cegprakash: they are not AntiSquid I asked my collegues to register
 Clagus: @Bastett yeah - it seems that it only gets files in current folder
 AntiSquid: you're not in top 100 on the company leaderboard cegprakash
 cegprakash: No I can see it
 Bastett: @clagus that works if you haven't organized your code into multiple directories. Good enough&#160;:)
 anid: Yeah they are 84th
 Bastett: Right, bronze. Hurrah.
 AntiSquid: oh
 AntiSquid: was looking at schools
 Doju: "grid = grid.grid"
 Doju: clean and legible
 Doju: :D
 Clagus: @Bastett yeah :D for now I just want to split my single file a bit :P 
 AntiSquid: nice
 Clagus: @Bastett thx for help
 shashwat986: Wait, this doesn't even make sense. I fix collisions, and I lose 60 ranks. Maybe my pacs headbutting themselves had some deeper strategic meaning?
 Doju: Maybe :P
 Bastett: @shashwat986 are both your headbutting pacs abandoning the high value area you were heading to?
 Bastett: or is one yielding to the other?
 AntiSquid: 60 ranks is noise shashwat986
 shashwat986: One's yielding to the other. That 
 shashwat986: I think it's probably picking up some even more suboptimal path
 shashwat986: I need to work on pellet selection
 shashwat986: Thanks AntiSquid, I hope you're right
 AntiSquid: 2167 people in the same league, ofc i am right
 RockyMullet: Is there a way to tell an enemy pac is dead not just out of sight&#160;?
 AntiSquid: just resubmit
 cegprakash: try changing ur profile pic shashwat986
 AntiSquid: why&#160;? it's a nice pic
 mark7: really cegprakash changin profile pic doesn't imporve your rank
 shashwat986: Oh crap! Maybe it's bringing balance to the pacs, leading them to give my enemies a few more pellets
 shashwat986: mark7 I'm sure he was kidding XD
 tobk: I fixed my pacs to actually do 2 steps instead of just one when on speed and lost 30 ranks, too...
 mark7: Ya me too :joy:
 whadk: what order are the visble pacs given in?
 cegprakash: if u change ur profile pic u can confuse opponents.. they forgot who you are and they play differently so u win
 eulerscheZahl: by id
 whadk: are they like left to right or something
 whadk: oh ok
 mark7: 0, 1, 2, 3 ..
 whadk: but what about opponent ones?
 whadk: is it yours first or theirs first
 whadk: or alternate
 tobk: what does it matter?
 RockyMullet: yeah it shouldnt
 RockyMullet: matter
 cegprakash: just store them in an array the way u like whadk
 whadk: yeah i was just wondering
 cegprakash: just use the indexing convenient to you while printing original index
 tobk: never really paid attention to it. i usually put mine in a map id -&gt; pac or (x,y)-&gt;pac anyway
 njaber: Is there any situation where having our pacman do nothing would be optimal?
 whadk: it doesnt matter now that i realise
 Doju: oh
 shashwat986: njaber blocking an opposing pac&#160;?
 Doju: i've been trying to find why my code doesn't work
 tobk: yes, when trapped in a deadend and an opp pac that can kill you inthe only adjacnt cell
 Doju: my cell.get_neighbours() has no return line -.-
 shashwat986: ouch
 njaber: Oh right, then I need to count that as a possibility&#160;:(
 mark7: Does submitting make your rank go back.. Like I submitted and directly my rank went to 1300 from 550?
 ZarthaxX: it resets for the submit yes
 tobk: anyone using simulations/random plays/GA and the like yet, or mostly still if/else trees?
 mark7: if else
 mark7: :joy:
 Doju: I have absolutely no simulations
 Beerus: please show me memory errors instead of timeouts damn it
 Doju: also no consideration for pellet values
 tobk: thinking about using random plays for finding paths with most pellets...
 Beerus: i use mcts
 mark7: Ohh I do find path with most pellets like for depth of 35
 shashwat986: The fact that i'm able to get so much of my spaggeti code to execute every turn within 50ms just makes me remark at how cool computers are
 Doju: Wait, you guys actually put some thought into your pathing?
 Doju: mine is still just closest pellet
 mark7: Yes.
 mark7: What if you dont find any pellet
 Doju: pick a random cell and roll with it :D
 eulerscheZahl: of course we plan our paths
 tobk: I create a heatmap from pellet values, with the 10s spreading a bit to surrounding fields
 tobk: but it's not optimal if the spread from the 10 occludes all the 1s on the way
 tobk: (i.e. can't tell if a cell has 1 or 0 if there is a 10 closeby)
 Doju: Wait, there's no point to bfs if you just simulate everything with random moves, right?
 eulerscheZahl: there is
 eulerscheZahl: you can only apply moves to a certain depth
 eulerscheZahl: then you have a "final" board state and apply some scoring to it
 eulerscheZahl: like the distance to other pellets
 Doju: ooh
 mark7: I dont maintain a board state
 Doju: I see
 Doju: mark7 then how do you pick which action path to take?
 JRFerguson: hi all, is the forum dead&#160;?
 mark7: for Every Pac check all four direction go to direction with most pellets and no collision with other pacs 
 mark7: and some more conditions..
 eulerscheZahl: yes, dead
 Doju: Can you even do simulation to any meaningful depth with python?
 Doju: It seems like speed would really become an issue
 mark7: you can
 Noaaaa: god im so bad at this
 Uljahn: python, simulation, meaningful: choose any two
 AntiSquid: which god&#160;? be more specific
 JRFerguson: i need help understanding some specifics about movement 
 JRFerguson: if 2 pacs are next to each other, different type
 JRFerguson: one moves left, other moves right
 JRFerguson: how is that resolved&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: they are now further away, if the left one is the one moving left
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise: the killing pacman will move, the other is blocked
 JRFerguson: yeah, stupid question really, thx euler
 eulerscheZahl: 2999 players already
 Doju: I just got an idea...
 Doju: or a few of them, actually
 Doju: I don't think I'm gonna need monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: the simulation is the "lazy way" to cover a lot of cases without much code
 eulerscheZahl: 3000 :tada: :balloon:
 AntiSquid: 3k&#160;!
 AntiSquid: and it's only first saturday :D
 GetSchwifty: #lockdown
 Over9000: I got this weird error a couple of times now ...
 Over9000: I get the second to last to line of the grid
 Over9000: OK
 Over9000: I try to get last line of grid
 Over9000: TIMEOUT
 AntiSquid: nah, it's obviously flawless game design GetSchwifty 
 AntiSquid: or the prizes
 GetSchwifty: or the community&#160;;)
 Doju: there's PRIZES?!
 GetSchwifty: i'm glad I now have a productive distraction
 eulerscheZahl: a monitor for the winner
 Doju: Time to make the best bot ever
 Doju: or at least try
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>at the bottom
 GetSchwifty: no more blind programming!
 Doju: GetSchwifty lol
 eulerscheZahl: my monitor slowly breaks&#160;:(
 Doju: I just got a new one but that fancy curved VA one wouldn't hurt
 eulerscheZahl: when i open a window for a longer time, i can still see where it was 5 minutes after i closed it
 Doju: ouch
 Doju: that does hurt
 eulerscheZahl: i have that monitor for about 8 years now and in general i really like it
 eulerscheZahl: 2560x1440
 eulerscheZahl: 27"
 Doju: should i have my method for getting a cell's neighbours in the cell class or in the grid class?
 Doju: It seems silly either way
 Illedan: w00t, that worked :D
 Doju: in the cell class i need to pass in the grid
 Doju: and in the grid class i need to pass in the cell's pos
 Clagus: in the grid
 Clagus: cell should not know about other cells
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 Doju: i meaannn...
 Doju: my cells have parents
 Doju: :D
 eulerscheZahl: easier to enumerate your movement options when you loop over the list of neighbors
 eulerscheZahl: and no more torus pain. just add the neighbors and done
 Clagus: I thought it was a theoretical question :D
 Doju: yeah it was
 Doju: i think :d
 Doju: lemme think about this
 Clagus: like from the object-oriented point of view, with single responsibility
 eulerscheZahl: that's a coding contest, not a design contest
 Clagus: but if the other cells are family, then I guess it's ok :D
 GetSchwifty: alabama?
 Doju: rofl
 shashwat986: JRFerguson since they're colliding, but they're different types, the winner moves, the loser gets blocked, and they're both in the same spot for a second
 Doju: Im gonna rewrite that in the grid class and see if it's better
 shashwat986: wait, what question did i just answer?
 Doju: and tbh i need to rewrite it anyways
 eulerscheZahl: this one shashwat986
 eulerscheZahl: if 2 pacs are next to each other, different typeone moves left, other moves righthow is that resolved&#160;?
 shashwat986: right
 shashwat986: thanks
 shashwat986: so since we have 2 pacs in the same spot, the winner eats the loser
 shashwat986: (at least that's what i understand from the rules)
 mortenschioler: 2Pac's in the game?
 shashwat986: lots of them, up to 5 per team, I think, in bronze
 tomatoes: and winner also eat pellet?
 Tiramon: pellets are eaten after fight so yes
 Doju: Actually, should my cell class even have a position?
 Doju: since that's technically stored in the grid
 Doju: extra-actually:
 Doju: why do i even have a cell class
 Doju: oh right, it needs to have a parent and "explored"
 Doju: nvm
 mark7: OMG GUYS MY BOT BEAT eulerscheZahl 's BOT THIS IS EPIC
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459550936">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459550936</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh i crashed. thanks for reporting
 mark7: :joy:
 Doju: hahah
 mark7: And I jumped out of my chair
 Doju: How do you get the neighbours of  cell in a 2d array
 Doju: in a clean fashion in python?
 Doju: i googled around but nobody really has a good method that doesn't rely on imports
 shashwat986: Can only I see my STDERR stream?
 ZarthaxX: ye
 mark7: check x - 1, x + 1, y - 1, y + 1
 eulerscheZahl: not python Doju but to get the idea. i removed the torus part on purpose
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47c9a8b6-f093-41ea-a5ca-6b3bb50e52df">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47c9a8b6-f093-41ea-a5ca-6b3bb50e52df</a>
 mark7: also wrap around like this
 mark7:         if (curScore.x &lt; 0) curScore.x = height - 1;
 ZarthaxX: lots of ifs
 mark7: Ya
 Doju: Oh yeah eulerscheZahl's method is definitely way better than mine
 ZarthaxX: Point move_in_dir(Point&amp; p, int d, int w, int h) {	return Point((p.x + dirs4[d].x + w)&#160;% w, (p.y + dirs4[d].y + h)&#160;% h);}
 Doju: thanks
 cegprakash: or just do curScore&#160;%= (height, width)
 ZarthaxX: if u do modulo u can wraparound
 perseverent: can you switch speed and move at the same time?
 mark7: no
 mark7: not woth same pac
 cegprakash: but yeah need to handle negative modulo
 perseverent: thanks
 ZarthaxX: no need if u do what i did
 Doju: and yeah mark7 that's pretty much what i was planning to do
 Doju: now how would you do the same thing for an n-dimension array?
 Doju: not that i need to do it
 Doju: just that doing anything like this in a dimension-independent way is, in my experience, almost always the best way
 Doju: just a whole lot of ifs and loops?
 Tiramon: great had a bug in building my grid ...arg
 Tiramon: yay now the testcase is successfull =)
 Tiramon: always worth creating some testcases&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: unit tests, so advanced
 eulerscheZahl: i'm lazy
 Doju: you have testcases? :o
 cegprakash: did somebody say testcases?
 Tiramon: i want to make sure my pathfinding works as expected
 shashwat986: are there any other ruby devs here?
 AntiSquid: MadKnight
 eulerscheZahl: not really a dev, he never writes more than 5 lines
 shashwat986: XD
 AntiSquid: on the leaderboard page select ruby under language
 AntiSquid: 29 total
 AntiSquid: one might be a dev in real life
 mark7: eulerscheZahl another win this one is clear one.. but I need to still imporve my path finding when less pallets
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459571527">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459571527</a>
 Hvosten: Hi , I'm writing new chellenge in groovySometimes I have time out and without changing code, when I gave replay in the same conditions everything works fine. My algorithm is deterministic. So I dont know if there is some problem with groovy here&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: you could report it on discord or on the forums
 Kellthazar: Is anyone using QuadTree to improve the pathfind code?
 Doju: Kellthazar definitely not
 mark7: What is a QuadTree
 Over9000: Hvosten Well some variation in timing is natural, due to server load, scheduling, and other factors
 mark7: Ohh like Binary tree
 Doju: i mean definitely not me
 Doju: someone might be, who knows
 Over9000: So if you're always close to timeout it might sometimes hit the limit
 AntiSquid: that sounded like it's meant to be a special amazing data structure, you should have joined during last contest, see what name you can find for that kind of tree (ocean of code) Kellthazar
 mark7: Looks like bronze leader-board is stuck
 Kellthazar: Hahaha... my A* reach the 1000ms timeout if calcs the distance for every point.
 cegprakash: mark7 go study for ur exams. Why are u coding instead of studying for exams :p
 mark7: My exams got posponed
 mark7: and who wants to study Network Mangement
 mark7: :joy:
 Doju: Oh btw i think you could speed up pathfinding a lot
 Doju: if you optimize it so that
 mark7: Or just don't do pathfindin
 cegprakash: yeah ditch Network Management learn Neural Networks instead
 Doju: if one square in a path is in the path from some other square to the same goal you just copy the rest of the path
 Kellthazar: I use path find only to calc the "real"  distances between walkable floors.
 Doju: ooor just make some nodes or something
 eulerscheZahl: told you to do BFS
 eulerscheZahl: hey YannT is onlineping
 Illedan: wow 3k players now
 YannT: yo
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces announced another Kotlin heroes
 eulerscheZahl: May 29th
 mark7: codeforces div 4 :joy:
 YannT: what be dat
 mark7: how low would they go now
 eulerscheZahl: 2.5h, about 6-10 problems to solve. Kotlin only
 eulerscheZahl: tshirts for top50 + 50 random players last time
 YannT: sounds cool!
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contests?complete=true">https://codeforces.com/contests?complete=true</a>
 YannT: speaking of my first cg tshirt should arrive any day in the post now&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *euler warms up the IntelliJ IDEA Java-&gt;Kotlin converter*
 eulerscheZahl: great
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by that mark7&#160;? (i don't go on codeforces so no clue what you're on about)
 mark7: they had 3 type of round division 1, 2, 3
 eulerscheZahl: i have my tshirt chance next saturday. let's see how codejam goes
 mark7: higher the number easier the problems
 mark7: they now also introduces div 4
 AntiSquid: ah ok
 Kellthazar: I thought that A* was more fast eulerscheZahl, I will try BFS for sure...
 mark7: A* don't give shortest path 
 eulerscheZahl: BFS gives you the distance from 1 node to all others, not just one to one
 AntiSquid: why is everyone updating euler about their bots&#160;? all day every day :D
 eulerscheZahl: and A* is a heuristic search. you can't be sure to actually find the shortest path
 eulerscheZahl: then i'll update you in return. got pushed to #3 :o
 mark7: eulerscheZahl is a *GURU* haha
 mark7: :joy:
 YannT: I used floy warshall to precalc all distances from everywhere to everywhere round 1
 YannT: works like a charm
 Astrobytes: Uncle Euler the CG Oracle
 eulerscheZahl: floyd warshall even has a worse time complexity for grids
 eulerscheZahl: but if it's fast enough: sure, why not
 YannT: I used it like cells are a graph tho
 eulerscheZahl: great algo in terms of codesize
 Doju: oh floyd-warshall has weights?
 Doju: hmm i might need that
 YannT: my complexity is O(N^3) but where N is number of walkable cells, no grid size
 YannT: so it's not horrible
 eulerscheZahl: and my BFS from each cell is O(n^2)
 eulerscheZahl: 20ms on large maps
 YannT: yeah mine's more like 100ms
 BaconHairkid56: huh
 YannT: but out of 1s it doesn't really matter
 BaconHairkid56: .-.
 eulerscheZahl: fast enough
 AntiSquid: flexing the bfs
 BaconHairkid56: :worried:
 BaconHairkid56: :confused:
 AntiSquid: bacon isn't supposed to have hair on it, shave it off before you fry it BaconHairkid56
 ekym: lua is the superior language
 Astrobytes: Bacon has hair on it when it's alive&#160;:(
 Beerus: with the exact same conditions i dont get timeout on visual studio but i get timeout on codin ide
 eulerscheZahl: 2222 in bronze
 AntiSquid: might be vegan bacon Astrobytes
 Beerus: how i am supposed to find the bug
 Astrobytes: Fair point AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: timer 0.00479578 my bfs 
 AntiSquid: i think that's 4 ms, i win
 eulerscheZahl: single cell or whole map?
 AntiSquid: every cell to every other cell distance calc via bfs
 Doju: waait, you take the bfs all the way to the whole map?
 Doju: i just stop it when i get a valid cell
 eulerscheZahl: run full BFS from each cell
 AntiSquid: it's first turn precalc Doju
 eulerscheZahl: that gives the dist from each cell to each other
 akshat: Someone please guide me on pathfinding, what should be the stop condition for BFS? If I calculate BFS scores to whole grid from each pac then all the pacs go to the same point, if I give it a limited depth then nothing works&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: empty queue is a good exit condition
 akshat: but that's when all the map is traversed
 akshat: so all pac has a common target
 AntiSquid: my code is unoptimized, i guess c++ is just faster
 eulerscheZahl: definitely
 eulerscheZahl: and my code isn't speed optimized either
 eulerscheZahl: using OOP, not just arrays
 Doju: def get_cell_neighbours(cell): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2949db02-d8af-42bd-b528-486db20a4bd1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2949db02-d8af-42bd-b528-486db20a4bd1</a>
 Doju: i reckon that'll work
 AntiSquid: i do use objects, a lot
 Doju: not clean by any means but at least cleaner than my original solution
 PiterYeh: Beerus if your program takes 45ms  per turn to execute on your intel i9 @5Ghz it might take 200ms to run on the overloaded cloud server that CG is using
 Doju: Oh right i forgot the warp-around
 eulerscheZahl: CG servers are fine now. they added more instances
 eulerscheZahl: and there is a match queue anyways. so the performance isn't affected by other games
 Quidome: Nice&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: just how fast your submit finishes
 Sopu: Is it normal to have a move action that shows up in the standard output but doesn t show up in the game summary?
 dbf: yes, today it is great - submits are fast
 eulerscheZahl: actually there are 2 queues. high priority for IDE games, low prio for submit
 PiterYeh: but still, a server cpu is probably significantly slower that a high end cpu, su maybe he is having this kind of problem
 PiterYeh: i wonder, how many instances does CG use? this looks like a lot of work
 eulerscheZahl: i only know that they have 2.2GHz to 3GHz
 eulerscheZahl: used to be the amazon cloud
 [CG]Thibaud: Sopu, maybe your output is desynchornized from the game. Happens if you sned multiple lines of output during a turn. You read 1 turn only, but played x turns
 eulerscheZahl: they wanted to move to Azure. not sure if they did it in the end
 JBM: time for some Haskell <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm">https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm</a>
 akshat: How do you guys manage that your pacs don't collide to each other?
 dbf: [CG]Thibaud, thanks for your hotfixes done yesterday, performance is good today
 akshat: when you run BFS
 Astrobytes: Ah too early for me JBM, I'll have to watch it later
 BenjaminUrquhart: magic
 MaxCol06:&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud:&#160;:)
 MaxCol06:&#160;???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
 AntiSquid: MaxCol06 please stop
 MaxCol06: Ok
 AntiSquid: you keep spamming, you summon the wrath of AutomatonNN
 Doju: yeah [CG]Thibaud you werre really quick when anything happened
 AutomatonNN: 50* 25 now
 AntiSquid: see&#160;? now you have to do math
 Kazamisa: Hi 
 Kazamisa: I saw an achievement called puzzle of the week 
 [CG]Thibaud: we tried. Ideally, these issues wouldn't happen but well
 llllllllll: in which order do pacs start 'looking around'&#160;? N E S W&#160;?
 Kazamisa: what is it looked in puzzles I didnt find anything called like that 
 [CG]Thibaud: it appears in your notifications Kazamisa (every week)
 [CG]Thibaud: puzzle changes every week
 Kazamisa: aa thanks 
 jrke: hey any CG staff
 jrke: here
 eulerscheZahl: akshat there are several ways to avoid collision. some kind of random search is the easiest IMO
 eulerscheZahl: you could also look into Kuhn-Munkres
 eulerscheZahl: aka hungarian method
 akshat: Okay, thank you @eulerscheZahl :D
 [CG]Thibaud: well I wrote something 2 message above yours jrke :D
 [CG]Thibaud: +s
 jrke: :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: you might have left in the last 30s
 jrke: but i can beat a player above my rank in local ide but still my rank doesn't goes above them
 jrke: i am submitting again and again if any error but same thing
 eulerscheZahl: then you perform worse against other players
 jrke: ya to some players
 Ken_Fool: is it normal that the codingame ide has no codecompletion?
 Ken_Fool: i though i had it a couple of days before
 Over9000: Maybe you turned it off in settings (left sidebar)

 BenjaminUrquhart: k looks like it's time to work on my bot
 thethiny: 12 hours and you're here
 thethiny: welcome @Benjamin
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 thethiny: I just woke up
 thethiny: it was a power sleep
 Ken_Fool: #Over9000 thx for the typ i found the expert mode but nothing about completion mb i try another browser
 Ken_Fool: *tip
 Uljahn: they fixed it, so it's less agressive now i guess, ctrl+space to manually summon autocompletion
 Ken_Fool: yeah i use ctrl+space but it never finds any functionnames and im lazy af
 Ken_Fool: it is what it is
 Ken_Fool: ^^
 Uljahn: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get any suggestions in code completion either. i'm using C#, might be different on other languages
 Uljahn: py3 the same
 thethiny: you only get code completion if it is in the scope of the window
 Ken_Fool: c++ on my end, i did some codingbattles and it had pretty nice completion on stl
 Ken_Fool: but that was last weekend or that before
 Ken_Fool: #thethiny so never for anything global?
 thethiny: window scope not function scope
 Clagus: For C# guys: if anyone is interested how I solved copying multiple classes into single file to copy-paste into CondinGame web IDE:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/61698295/2941313">https://stackoverflow.com/a/61698295/2941313</a>

 thethiny: this explains how the IDE sees
 Ken_Fool: hm mb, i should use some other ide then, but i love the idea of lighweight only using browser
 thethiny: yeah same here but I don't wanna instal TWO apps
 thethiny: Visual Code + 2 other apps
 [CG]Thibaud: there is something off with this autocompletion. I'll tell the devs
 thethiny: automaton2000 tell devs there's an issue
 Automaton2000: does anyone know if you can
 Ken_Fool: i love vscode for reading but i do not want to dev in it. when i add the c++ stuff it gets rly distracting to read
 thethiny: extensions
 lxnn: Have I misunderstood something, or does SPEED not do anything?
 thethiny: you misunderstood something
 AntiSquid: yes
 Uljahn: yes

 lxnn: Oh right, thanks
 Ken_Fool: haha just running the code to fix my typos and accidently keep beating the boss lol
 Ken_Fool: :D
 thethiny: intentional cuz it says Trap
 BetterThanJohannes: Why does it time out in c#
 Over9000: 98% battles done, and now nothing seems to happen any more :sad:
 Over9000: I mean :cry:
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan not intentional yet, as i don't track invisible opponents
 Illedan: aiit
 thethiny: then how did you say trap?
 Over9000: Woo this latest submit pushed me 100+ ranks!
 Illedan: you still wrecked me on this submit
 eulerscheZahl: but i have some nice kills
 eulerscheZahl: thethiny of course it was intentional in the end. but not planned for several turns

 Doju: my neighbouring cell finder finally works
 Doju: Like the cleaner one
 Doju: exceept that i think it should still be in the cell class
 jrke: check this antisquid

 AntiSquid: check what
 eulerscheZahl: thethiny why don't i kill you at frame 56? debugging time
 jrke: replay your pac 
 jrke: both pac same position from starting to beginning
 jrke: sorry 
 jrke: starting to ending
 kovi: hungary dominates the top
 eulerscheZahl: :de:
 AntiSquid: ya look at my bot's rank, kinda expected imo jrke :p
 jrke: look at my rank also:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 AntiSquid: ya ok bad rank :p
 AntiSquid: i belarus, russia, germany, romania and then hungary though 
 AntiSquid: i see *
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459622010">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459622010</a>any suggestion what else can i do
 aangairbender: guys earlier Ctrl+S didnt open save dialog, did it?
 aangairbender: its so irritating
 Illedan: agreed aangairbender
 aangairbender: just a habit saving the code every 5 sec
 Astrobytes: Same
 Doju: same
 Ken_Fool: is the battles thingy buggy for you guys too atm?
 Ken_Fool: it is rly slow and when i want to get back to my code i get an red popup error message sending me to the contest start page
 eulerscheZahl: jrke frame 14 eat the big pellet
 jrke: K
 eulerscheZahl: and around 80 you have a bad coordiation between 2 pacmen
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl #3, gg!
 dbdr: too late :D
 eulerscheZahl: 4
 jrke: yes euler thanks
 dbdr: was true at the time
 jrke: ranks as changing like flow of water
 jrke: every refresh you got another rank
 eulerscheZahl: in a small margin it's constant
 Cappefra: my next step is going to be handling cooperation between friendly pacs
 jrke: ya but in my stage its not constant
 shashwat986: What sort of cooperation are you thinking off Cappefra&#160;?
 shashwat986: *of
 aangairbender: marking next step of friendly pacs as an obstacle in the pathfinding should work well for the first time
 Doju: aangairbender that's what i was about to do
 Cappefra: @shashwat986 I'm not sure, for starters I just want my pacs to never be stuck with each other
 Doju: Cappefra that's pretty easy
 aangairbender: I have just realized I marked target cell not the next cell
 Doju: just check if a pac has been in the same pos for two moves in a row
 Doju: and then do something about it
 Doju: So i was wondering just now
 dbdr: kovi trouncing me 3-0feels like OOC all over again :D
 Doju: if you want to simulate moves
 Doju: recursion seems like a smart strategy for that
 Doju: but how do you simulate the enemy?
 Doju: if you do the same simulation for the enemy, you just get into an infinite loop
 aangairbender: these boys know something about mcts related stuff
 aangairbender: I am in legend league in poker chip race with some kind of smitsimax
 aangairbender: maybe smth like that will work here
 llllllllll: still dont understand how the pacs decide which way to go if they have 2 paths with the same distance
 jrke: will all league open on monday or only silver
 aangairbender: only silver I guesss
 aangairbender: as it was in ooc
 jrke: i think silver and gold
 lxnn: Is there a way to display debugging messages on the game interface?
 Doju: Argh why do my pacs think there are no pellets left when they haven't even explored all of the cells
 jrke: input is given only of those pellets which have seen by your pacs
 Doju: No i'm using a different method
 jrke: so can't say anything
 Doju: i'm assuming that there are pellets everywhere unless the pacs see that they aren't there
 Clagus: 10 point pellets are always visible right? so they always appear in turn inputs until eaten?
 Doju: yes
 Snef: yes
 jrke: yes
 icecream17: so you know where opponent is if eaten
 Clagus: wow, so much possibilities
 Clagus: yeah I just realized that :D
 Illedan: kovi, you have bugs :D
 kovi:&#160;?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459640470">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459640470</a>
 Illedan: The last pac you lose just stops in the corner :P
 Illedan: Oh, nvm. I had 1 more round of speed. Damn tooltip -.-
 Illedan: But how do I have more speed than you&#160;:/ 
 Illedan: Oh, you only move 1 dist with that last speed
 kovi: interesting game for sure. both loss
 Illedan: So yeah, bug :D
 kovi: i wont call it bug...but weakness
 Illedan: Moving 1 less step than you can, while being chased by a hungry Pac? That's a bug.
 jrke: how you guys know that pellet is present at this point if there is no visible pellet
 jrke:&#160;?
 thethiny: you know at the start
 Doju: jrke i don't know
 Doju: for sure
 thethiny: then everytime you eat one you remove it
 jrke: i had did but if enemy pac eaten one and enemy pac is invisible the
 jrke: n
 thethiny: you have to assume pellet is there until proven otherwise
 Doju: thetiny to that you also need to add that every time you see a cell is empty you remove it
 thethiny: yes correct
 jrke: K means i am right
 jrke: i did same thing
 Doju: If you really want to get efficient with that strategy
 Over9000: Oh the symmetry: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459646325">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459646325</a>
 Doju: you could try to guess which pellets the opponent's pacs have eaten
 thethiny: BTW guys don't use euclediean distance use manhattan
 Illedan: Use the real walking dist.
 Doju: thetiny dont use manhattan use BFS
 jrke: i know were using that only
 thethiny: @Over9000 you fail to recognize warps
 Over9000: Warps?
 thethiny: if you go from the side you come from the other side
 Over9000: Ah I know what you mean
 Over9000: No that's intentional, it doesn't see anything useful there because the other one ate it all
 Doju: xD
 Over9000: I do recognize warps
 thethiny: okay
 Doju: fair enough, Over9000
 jrke: is this in each map that if you go from the side you come from the other side
 jrke:&#160;?
 thethiny: yes
 Doju: not in every map
 Doju: some maps are closed
 Over9000: Yes, if both sides have floor there
 thethiny: oh not each map
 jrke: then how can we came to know which map have and which haven't
 thethiny: does anyone have the seed from Benjamin?
 thethiny: I saved it in notepad but I forgot that you can't undo in it
 Doju: jrke i'm not sure if you can do that with manhattan distance in a smart way
 Doju: but it's pretty easy to integrate into bfs
 thethiny: @ BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh um
 BenjaminUrquhart: which one
 thethiny: the infinite loop
 pwahs: can someone tell me the maximum size of the map?
 thethiny: Constraints2 ≤ Number of pacs per player ≤ 529 ≤ width ≤ 3510 ≤ height ≤ 17
 pwahs: I couldn't find it in the rules
 RockyMullet: 29 ≤ width ≤ 3510 ≤ height ≤ 17
 BenjaminUrquhart: seed=-7826971533994987500
 pwahs: aah, thanks&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: hold up I broke something in my submit
 thethiny: Thanks ben
 thethiny: yes I saw that
 thethiny: you're rank #493 now
 BenjaminUrquhart: cause I broke stuff
 thethiny: @ Over9000 try the seed 
 arnial: we can't access to the silver league yet&#160;? 
 thethiny: nop
 jrke: no it will open on monday
 james1729: Does anyone know if pacs can see across warps
 arnial: haaa&#160;! try to improved my AI cause i thought it wasn't good enouth to rank up 
 thethiny: yes they can @james
 james1729: Thanks
 thethiny: you should always try to improve your rank
 thethiny: after all there are only 3 winners
 thethiny: and 97 complimentary moral awards
 arnial: yes but we will have ne rules after that 
 icecream17: and a lot of gold awards too!
 pwahs: @arnial, no, rules are done
 icecream17: and silver, and bronze, and wood
 icecream17: everyone gets a prize
 thethiny: The new rules, I doubt they exist, will continue from here
 thethiny: @icecream17 I don't think wood get awards
 arnial: you think the rules are setlled&#160;?
 muy31: CG points!
 thethiny: it said that the rules are settled
 muy31: thats the prize
 thethiny: in the video it says so
 Thiesjoo: Wow  i started bullying my enemies and i went up 500 places
 Thiesjoo: Wtf
 thethiny: hahaha
 jrke: hey anybody knows how to get smallest value func in c++ min() isn't working
 Scarfield: min will work for 2 intergers, are you trying it on an array?
 Clagus: can a pac see through the "teleport" pass (through the edges of the map)?
 Cappefra: Yeah Clagus I think so
 RockyMullet: yes
 Clagus: thx
 KiwiTae: RockyMullet o/
 MadKnight: hihi
 KiwiTae: MadKnight u joined the contest?
 BenjaminUrquhart: KiwiTae looks like it
 BenjaminUrquhart: 1309th bronze in ruby
 AntiSquid: hi kiwi
 KiwiTae: ohoh o/ hey AntiSquid ~
 AntiSquid: o/
 KiwiTae: just submitted smth after blindly coding for a few hours &gt;,&lt; 
 Doju: I don't even know how it's possible to beat the top players
 PiterYeh: I remember that in C++ you can use pragmas to enable a -O3 optimized build. Does anybody know if there is something similar for C#?
 Doju: like they probably simulate every move
 Illedan: Doju, you need to eat more pellets than them
 KiwiTae: Illedan good call
 Doju: Illedan oh riiight thanks
 Doju: I have 400 damn lines of code and i'm #732...&#160;:/
 Illedan: 755 lines
 RockyMullet: hey KiwiTae&#160;!
 BenjaminUrquhart: lines don't really mean anything other than complexity though
 Doju: Although i have no RPS or enemy logic
 Doju: or anything advanced really
 eulerscheZahl: PiterYeh you don't need anything like that for C#. We get release mode in the arena since recently
 eulerscheZahl: but only for C# and Rust
 PiterYeh: oh alright, thanks
 PiterYeh: i can evaluate like 30 nodes in 50ms. I guess i just suck&#160;:/
 Kellthazar: Evaluate the distance?
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7437757-3ebf-4847-a117-d400ef2f6878">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7437757-3ebf-4847-a117-d400ef2f6878</a>
 PiterYeh: evaluate a game state and his neighbors (the next turn)
 Doju: actually before i start doing anything i should just try to go for super pellets only
 KobeL: how do speed turns work? are they not moving towards your target give in your output for that turn,
 thethiny: they do 2 moves in 1 turn. Not 1 move for 2 turns.
 KobeL: so do you need to provide a second output within that turn?
 thethiny: no
 thethiny: example:
 KobeL: Ok that's what I was expecting, hmm
 thethiny: you're at 0, 0 and you want to go to 0, 3
 thethiny: if speed is on
 thethiny: you become 0, 2
 thethiny: if speed is off
 thethiny: you become 0, 1
 thethiny: it's still 1 turn
 Uljahn: just specify a target 2 steps away
 KobeL: Uljahn that's it, that's why some of my pacs weren't making their speed moves
 icecream17: is this "flood" correct? 
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ab484f5-b2d2-4188-9061-6edc861dba0c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ab484f5-b2d2-4188-9061-6edc861dba0c</a>
 Illedan: Anyone have a seed with 5 pacs and a complex map?
 Doju: Illedan are you pushing those simulation levels? :P
 Illedan: I'm not simulating. (yet)
 Uljahn: seed=4029809621905664000 but no teleports
 Doju: wow
 KobeL: how do you get the seed from a game?
 BenjaminUrquhart: options tab
 Illedan: Enable Expert mode under settings kovi
 Illedan: *KobeL
 thethiny: next to your name at the bottom
 ZarthaxX: Illedan not searching?
 KobeL: found it thx
 Illedan: Search yeah, sim no.
 KobeL: seed=7146388042811426800relatively complex 5 pac
 Kellthazar: My BFS algorithm took 379 ms to calc all distances... =/
 ZarthaxX: whats the difference..
 ZarthaxX: u mean u are not doing a depth search?
 Illedan: :D
 ZarthaxX: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: Kellthazar do it all on the first turn
 BenjaminUrquhart: you get a full second there
 Illedan: Thx for that seed KobeL. It has some features I need to test
 KobeL: You're welcome Illedan!
 Kellthazar: Yeah, I'm doing, still got timeout sometimes.
 Doju: Wait, are these guys seriously doing 30 move deep simulations?
 Doju: that's...
 KobeL: lol who's doing that?
 Doju: 8.5*10^26 different decisions
 Doju: i think eulerscheZahl is doing that
 eulerscheZahl: no, only 4 turns :Dbut i might step it up a bit tomorrow
 Doju: oh lol
 Doju: not sure how i got the number 30 in my head
 Doju: ok thats not that bad
 Doju: a few thousand
 eulerscheZahl: my search is still flawed
 YannT: you do the 9^10 order combinations per turn eulerscheZahl? Oo
 Doju: isn't it 7,9?
 eulerscheZahl: hell no :D
 eulerscheZahl: check this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459694476">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459694476</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i only get 1 large pellet
 eulerscheZahl: that's something to work on: get 2 at least
 YannT: it's 9 possible decisions per pac per turn, and 10 pacs maximum (if doing opponent)
 YannT: so 9^10
 Doju: oh right the opponent
 Aitorcius: how can the pacmans move all together? (without threads if possible)
 Illedan: Only depth 4 euler? :P
 eulerscheZahl: for now...
 eulerscheZahl: i have ideas to get deeper
 Illedan: Damn
 Illedan: I'm at 22 xD
 Doju: whaat
 Waffle3z: what are you simulating?
 Doju: that's a stupid amount of calculations
 Doju: Illedan how
 eulerscheZahl: beam search
 Scarfield: haha nice avatar waffle :D
 Illedan: Pruning.
 eulerscheZahl: that's something to put into google&#160;;)
 Doju: Yeah i thought pruning would be a smart thing to do
 YannT: just expanding a state for all the possible move combinations took too muych time when I tried it :p
 BenjaminUrquhart: Aitorcius you can command multiple pacs using a bar-separated line of output
 BenjaminUrquhart: "MOVE 0 1 1 | MOVE 1 2 2"
 Aitorcius: ouh i forgot that, it is my first bot programming ty too much
 Matjaz: Do you guys write all the code in the codingame editor or is there a good way to take the code our and run simulations?
 KiwiTae: Matjaz the referee is on github
 BenjaminUrquhart: I do it all in the editor
 Hjax: i write my code in eclipse, and then paste it into the editor 
 Aitorcius: Visual Studio
 PiterYeh: Matjaz <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359</a>
 Matjaz: I mean, I know I can edit it elsewhere but is there a decent way to partially test or somehow simulate a good part of it without pasting in and running it?
 zams: Theres a chrome plugin so you can save the code locally and it will upload it for you
 Matjaz: I see, the link above I assume.
 PiterYeh: The Java source code for the referee and somulation is open source, so you could run that locally
 PiterYeh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020</a>
 Matjaz: Thanks, I'll check it.
 Ken_Fool: gosh im malding
 Ken_Fool: i typed only '=' in all my new ifs and was wondering why my code doesnt work &gt;.&lt;
 Ken_Fool: time for coffe xD
 Marben: Does anybody else experience major issues with the Clojure language? Like lots of seemingly random "not provided 1 lines in time" messages?
 Marben: Right now I try to send "MOVE 0 1 1" in a loop and it times out....
 icecream17: check the standard error strean
 Marben: The funny thing is there is nothing there
 Marben: My code was running fine, but some battles are lost in 2 steps (with the timeouts) and if i send the parameters to the IDE those looses are not even reproducible
 Dr-D: Maybe some kind of server failures. Sadly they happen during contests
 icecream17: oh that's probably the overloaded server dont worry
 AntiSquid: so annoying ... send to IDE lost game, suddenly it's a win&#160;:/
 Dr-D: Uh, 4 more Dart-coders!
 thethiny: @AntiSquid randomness?
 AntiSquid: i know what it is, just wanted to complain
 thethiny: XD
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 explain it to him
 Automaton2000: i see the problem in my code
 thethiny: Can the seed be consistent?
 thethiny: somehow
 icecream17: OPTIONS -&gt; manual
 AntiSquid: what do you mean?
 AntiSquid: play on same seed?
 thethiny: if my code has random()
 thethiny: it will not generate the same number every run
 icecream17: no
 AntiSquid: yes you can set random seed
 icecream17: of course not
 AntiSquid: which language are you using?
 icecream17: wait
 thethiny: can we make the game server FORCE a seed?
 icecream17: no
 thethiny: that's what I mean
 BenjaminUrquhart: here's a question
 AntiSquid: for your game or for your bot's use of random
 icecream17: the game does the seed andf the sends inputs to you
 BenjaminUrquhart: can we write files to our running directory
 thethiny: Squid, what I mean is that don't allow users to have random seed, instead make it always give the same random
 thethiny: @Benjamin do ls with permissions and see if you have write
 AntiSquid: that's optional thethiny
 BenjaminUrquhart: the easiest solution is to not random
 AntiSquid: you can't force it on others though
 thethiny: yeah that's true
 icecream17: do 3895394357315987 * turn mod something so that it's basically random
 icecream17: make your own random function that's actually pretty random but consistent
 thethiny: that's smart
 thethiny: I will do that
 AntiSquid: btw it's this kind of squid <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mVmEv2e-e3o/maxresdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mVmEv2e-e3o/maxresdefault.jpg</a>

 BenjaminUrquhart: so yes, we have permissions to write within our folder
 Clagus: moving fast isn't actually moving faster per turn, it's freezing non-fast pacs for 1 turn... right?
 BenjaminUrquhart: kind of
 Doju: not really
 Clagus: but you can't get control of your pac in the second turn of movement
 Doju: yes
 Aitorcius: how can i avoid collisions? i mean change the direction if the pacmans collied
 thethiny: if current_pos = last_pos
 Clagus: you can check if they stay in the previous position
 Aitorcius: ok
 Kellthazar: remember to skip this check if you activate SPEED in the last turn&#160;:)
 Clagus: and then it's still tricky cause you have to know where are other pacs
 Clagus: and that :D
 thethiny: uhmm guys what's the best way to get the ms elapsed?
 Doju: which language?
 Clagus: in what language?
 BenjaminUrquhart: get time after receiving input and get he new time after output
 BenjaminUrquhart: the*
 BenjaminUrquhart: difference of the 2 is the time
 thethiny: python currently
 thethiny: int((time() - start_time) * 1000)%1000
 Schneewittchen: time.time()
 thethiny: I feel like this is wrong
 thethiny: because I'm getting 80ms
 Doju: not sure if it's the best but what i currently do is
 BenjaminUrquhart: when do you start it?
 Doju: import time
 thethiny: I start it after While True:
 Doju: t = time.process_time()
 Doju: after giving command to a pac
 BenjaminUrquhart: do it after you receive the first line of input
 Doju: i do elapsed_time =( time.process_time() - t) * 1000
 thethiny: oh damn 
 Doju: how did that
 Doju: lol
 thethiny: what Benjamin said works wonders
 Doju: elapsed time = time.proce
 thethiny: now it's 3ms
 Doju: why did i get a sad face
 thethiny: cuz you wrote&#160;: (
 Doju: i dont think i did
 Doju: oh wait yes i did
 thethiny: you used brackets
 Doju: nvm 
 thethiny: anyways thanks all for the help!
 AntiSquid: why&#160;% 1000 thethiny&#160;??
 thethiny: cuz time in milliseconds
 Doju: that's modulo
 Doju: oh you dont use the starting time?
 thethiny: yeah but I think I don't need it since int() already does that
 thethiny: good point AntiSquid
 kovi: grat illedan
 Matjaz: Should I be parsing the map and constructing the graph out of it? Or am I going the wrong direction?
 Kellthazar: Yes! Ny pre distances calcs now runs at 40ms. 
 Kellthazar: My*
 Zenoscave: Matjaz that is a good idea to do
 Matjaz: And should each space be a node or just intersections?
 Illedan: :D
 Matjaz: I'm not sure how to decide about that.
 Kellthazar: Matjaz that was the strategy I adopted...
 Zenoscave: depends on your usage
 Zenoscave: YMMV
 Matjaz: Alright, I guess I should just give it a go.
 Kellthazar: I build a graph composed only by the floors (I skip all the walls).
 anid: well done illedan
 Kellthazar: 79 - 126 (versus Illedan).
 Kellthazar: Oh well
 Doju: i got 86 - 121 vs Illedan
 Marben: im so confused, ive changed nothing but my time measurment and suddenly im climbing 100+ ranks
 Thiesjoo: I got 54-145. Still some improvements to be made
 Thiesjoo: Marben people learn and get better than you
 Thiesjoo: And if you resubmit your rank is recaculated. 
 Marben: Thiesjoo of course they do but thats not my point
 BenjaminUrquhart: 130-130 vs Kellthazar<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459735911">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459735911</a>
 Thiesjoo: Oh ok. That's weird. I have not gotten that issue myself. 
 BenjaminUrquhart: Illedan calm down there
 Kellthazar: BenjaminUrquhart, the MSG command is working?
 BenjaminUrquhart: you just append text after a command
 BenjaminUrquhart: MOVE 0 1 1 message
 Kellthazar: Oh, nice!&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: Thanks
 Schneewittchen: Is there a good way to check for dead enemy?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Schneewittchen: Well then..
 BenjaminUrquhart: I go by "if I can't see it, it doesn't exist"
 Schneewittchen: No predictions?

 RockyMullet: I agree with my non squidy friend
 Kellthazar: 101 - 126 After some movement rules improvement.
 eulerscheZahl: clash of code: short puzzles which you solve in limited time (15min maximum) you play against other users who get the same puzzle at the same time. if there are no other active users, you play against bots who replay the solution of earlier real contestants
 AntiSquid: euler enjoys it btw so invite him Mystical

 RockyMullet: bob ross makes me happy
 Schneewittchen: *flap flap flap*
 Schneewittchen: Cleans the brush
 RockyMullet: shake de devil out of it&#160;!
 njaber: Schneewittchen Dead enemy must have been killed by your pac, so theoricaly you should have seen it, but the problem is you intercept them at corners or something... The enemy dies before you know he was here
 RockyMullet: njaber thats annnoying
 RockyMullet: hard to tell that an enemy is dead and not just out of sight
 Schneewittchen: Jea he could have evaporated behind a corner
 njaber: Actually maybe they thought of it and decided to log it to you anyways, I haven't tested it, I just deduced that from the rule
 RockyMullet: I'm about to start a "possible enemy positions" just like OOC for those kind of problemes
 njaber: Yeah I'm doing the same
 AntiSquid: how will you handle missing enemies?
 Schneewittchen: Particle fiters gurlz
 AntiSquid: maybe they are stuck in a corner
 RockyMullet: well you can assume start position is a mirror of yours
 AntiSquid: later in the game i mean
 njaber: If you do your algorithm well enough you should be able to have it deduce that the enemy must be dead
 Zenoscave: Filter positions on MOVE!!!!!
 Waffle3z: resubmitted and dropped to last place after timing out every game in a row. I don't time out at all in the IDE
 RockyMullet: well just like OOC, you know where they could move, so every position moves
 RockyMullet: when you see them, then you reset everything
 Schneewittchen: Just do a spreading every move
 wlesavo: RockyMullet im doing the same, but silence every turn seems op
 RockyMullet: yeah you dont have all the same info than in OOC of course
 wlesavo: and its silence for 0, 1 and 2 also
 njaber: Jsut doing spreading doesn't allow you to deduce enemy position from taken pellets I think
 RockyMullet: but at least in this one you can see the pacs :P
 Zenoscave: plus up to 5 pacs
 Doju: Do you guys have something like a "Universe" class that has everything else in it?
 RockyMullet: njaber yeah most of the time you wont know actly where there are, but its worth it for the times you do
 Doju: i'm not sure if i should shove everything in a class
 AntiSquid: yes
 Waffle3z: are you programming in java?
 AntiSquid: do it 
 Doju: python
 AntiSquid: i mean why not
 Waffle3z: then you don't need a class
 AntiSquid: just throw everything in 
 Csipcsirip: yes, I too tried to implement a tracker like in OOC. but the branching is so huge it timeouts after few turns
 Doju: I feel like it might be handy later so alright why not
 wlesavo: Csipcsirip keep only positions
 AntiSquid: it will be messy lol
 Doju: to throw everything in a class?
 AntiSquid: well ofc
 Doju: isn't it messier to keep everything everywhere
 njaber: I think I'll do some kind of spreading+keeping in memory known pieces of info that could help eliminate possibilities if I get other possibilities
 njaber: other info*
 AntiSquid: idk i don't keep my tv and microwave in the bathroom just because i have my toilet in there Doju
 njaber: But you keep everything in your house
 AntiSquid: you keep everything in your bot
 njaber: He's just asking if having a special scope is worth anything
 njaber: a limiting scope
 njaber: I do, just in case I want to name something a name that exists natively for some reason
 BenjaminUrquhart: can't hurt
 Doju: OK im gonna do it and cry myself to sleep later when i'm too deep into it and realize that it's a bad idea
 k4ng0u: is there a way to debug games and using breakpoints? (for now I am mainly using standard errors or faking inputs but it's really inneficient)
 njaber: Grab the code from github and set it up so you can run games locally
 wlesavo: damn, removing a "feature" you thought was important sometimes gives outstanding results
 Hjax: @wlesavoits always fun when you fix a bug and your bot is worse after
 Hjax: oops wrong ping 
 Hjax: @wlesavo
 wlesavo: also that, yes
 yassineH: guys how am i supposed to use this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020</a> 
 BenjaminUrquhart: study material
 BenjaminUrquhart: Hjax same
 yassineH: i mean i have eclipse and i dont know what to run
 eulerscheZahl: do you have maven?
 yassineH: yes
 eulerscheZahl: import the github project as a maven project
 yassineH: i did and it build successful
 eulerscheZahl: then run the main class in the test folder
 yassineH: ah okay 
 yassineH: thx
 eulerscheZahl: you might want to edit it to use your own bots
 eulerscheZahl: there are commented lines that you have to uncomment and adjust
 yassineH: okay i will keep you updated..
 yassineH: thx
 AntiSquid: nice euler, got another fan who gives him bot updates :D
 Doju: Wait hold on, i'm freezing real good atm
 Doju: so i have my universe class that holds a list of pacs and the grid
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 Doju: how do i get data from the grid to the pacs
 Doju: without passing it in as a variable
 Doju: to the pac instances
 BenjaminUrquhart: you pass it in as a variable
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 Doju:&#160;:(
 Thiesjoo: Global variables?
 Doju: that seems wasteful
 Thiesjoo: Maybe pass a map instance
 AntiSquid: uhm you access the variable&#160;? it's in the same universe no?
 icecream17: closure
 BenjaminUrquhart: I do all my pac processing in my "Game" class which is basically the universe class
 BenjaminUrquhart: public Command getCommandFor(Pacman pac) {...}
 Doju: earlier i had the grid stored as a class variable in the pac class
 Doju: also if i pass them the grid as a variable
 jrke: How we came to know what can our pac see
 Doju: then they all have their own grids and can't get the same data from one grid, no?
 Doju: I haven't taken any formal programming courses as you can probably see :D
 Grrec: I bet there is no difference to a professional programmer :P
 AntiSquid: there's the degree
 AntiSquid: not everyone has that piece of paper
 Quidome: can you see the pellets behind an enemy pac?
 Doju: meh i'll just try passing the grid as a variable and see if it works, i guess
 BenjaminUrquhart: Quidome yes
 Quidome: thnxs
 Doju: actually i don't even have to change the code at all since i've been calling self.grid instead of Pac.grid. How convenient
 geppoz: lol there is a problem in speed move mode command
 Doju: Also why shouldn't you index the pacs by their id?
 eulerscheZahl: what problem geppoz? that it affects the number of turns until the game ends?
 geppoz: you cannot give order to go down and up again in the next double- move
 eulerscheZahl: oh right
 eulerscheZahl: that annoyed me too
 geppoz: if you need to go into a dead end and back
 geppoz: how can you give this command?
 Doju: or store them in a dict by their id
 eulerscheZahl: you can't, just waste 1 move
 geppoz: weird
 AntiSquid: it would be too complex obviously /s
 Csipcsirip: yeah its very annoying. have to put a ot of extra variables and ifs in the code
 eulerscheZahl: because everything has to be noob-friendly
 geppoz: :D
 AntiSquid: how is this noob friendly? lol
 eulerscheZahl: only 1 target point
 eulerscheZahl: ooh, screenshot time!
 AntiSquid: that autopathing is more of a hindrance 
 AntiSquid: i calculated perfect path, sent the goal as output only to get the shitty pathing from the ref&#160;:/ spent a good chunck of time yesterday trying to debug something that wasn't my faulyt
 geppoz: after I calc my path, i had to draw back since the base+2 move
 baDcoder: Hello, is it possible to run my bot against any other opponents lets say someone from my company&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 jrke: yes
 geppoz: but this fails in the case i said before
 eulerscheZahl: yes, remove the default opponent
 eulerscheZahl: but you can only select players in the top1000
 Doju: baDcoder yup, you need to enable the advanced mode from the settings in the sidebar
 Doju: i think
 Doju: then delete the default ai
 baDcoder: Thanks everyone, will try
 AntiSquid: no problem, glad to help
 eulerscheZahl: thank you so much AntiSquid :D
 IAmNoob: can anyone help me with a little easy code which i dont know why it dont functions because it is very easy?
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl did u do topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: what part of it?
 cegprakash: SRM
 AntiSquid: iamanoob you could watch streams for the contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJrfflbeOlM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJrfflbeOlM</a>
 IAmNoob: ok thx

 IAmNoob: thx a lot
 AntiSquid: no need
 Doju: oooohh i finally figured out a thing hahah
 Doju: i should be storing my different moving functions in a dictionary
 AntiSquid: or you could have callback functions&#160;!!
 Doju: oh those are a thingthanks AntiSquid
 shashwat986: AntiSquid do you use JS?
 AntiSquid:  /s&#160;?&#160;:/
 shashwat986: nope :D
 NSzx: Hey everyone, I have a quick question: in terms of scoring in the leaderboard, does a win with a huge gap have the same impact as a close win or are points in the battle taken into account?&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i do sometimes shashwat986
 shashwat986: Just curious, because I don't really ahve the context of your discussion with Doju, and I only know JS as having callbacks
 shashwat986: so I was curious how promises etc would work in a contest like this, and if they'd be useful
 AntiSquid: i think you got it wrong
 PiterYeh: shashwat986 there is no reason to use promises in this context, because everything is and must be syncronous
 AntiSquid: i mean you got the callback function part wrong shashwat986
 Over9000: test test
 AntiSquid: because it's not JS specific
 AntiSquid: Over9000 it didn't work
 AntiSquid: it's not exclusive to JS ...
 Aitorcius: wow NullReferenceException on my order line... What hapened?
 Doju: Is there any reason to give my pac instances ids if i'm storing them in a dict with ids as keys?
 RockyMullet: you accessed a null reference
 PiterYeh: Doju storing the id is pretty much free, so...
 Doju: PiterYeh well yeah, that's true
 Zenoscave: Illedan
 Zenoscave: You here?
 Doju: Feels like such a waste to restructure everything
 Doju: although my code is way more readable now
 AntiSquid: at least you have your own universe now&#160;?
 Doju: and yes, i have my own universe
 Lasamat: So I'm new to this site and in bronze league. Can I see the threshold for silver anywhere?
 BenjaminUrquhart: there is none yet
 Doju: There is no silver
 BenjaminUrquhart: that comes monday
 shashwat986: 5/11/20. What timezone? Does anyone know that in hours, say?
 Lasamat: Ah I see so as a beginner rank 1,200 ish is not so bad I guess. Thanks for telling me
 AntiSquid: 5pm UK time
 shashwat986: thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh hey I beat mazel once<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459789122">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459789122</a>
 AntiSquid: but akara chudra is first
 BenjaminUrquhart: and?
 eulerscheZahl: so it's not impressive
 BenjaminUrquhart: whoops I accidentally resubmitted 
 BenjaminUrquhart: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Doju: do you have a macro for that ascii art
 RockyMullet: I beat euler twice :D
 Over9000: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BenjaminUrquhart: `/flip`
 AntiSquid: you need to aim for the #1 headband
 Doju: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

 <b>**anid slaps colliding pacs around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/39427621192030" /> shashwat986: So, I took a good amount of time to ensure I'm moving two steps in Speed mode. Now I need to sit and undo that, because i'm overshooting the best possible spot XD
 icecream17: Ugh, my "superlongpath" was superlongpath [ '15 4', '14 4', '16 4', '15 3', '15 5' ]
 BenjaminUrquhart: that doesn't look very super
 o_imej: guys any idea for 2 pac collision&#160;? what can i do in this case, back 1 step&#160;? 
 BoBot: EAT THE OTHER ONE!
 BoBot: sry
 o_imej: they're both mine
 BoBot: I actually have not implemented that myself :D
 AntiSquid: no it's ok, the caps lock were necessary to show enthusiasm
 Durkin: did the exact same thing, shash, massive feelsbad
 BoBot: Pac on Pac violence
 solaimanope: how to handle more than one files for java?
 BoBot: I think if you memorize your position, and you are in the same position 2 times in a row, you should switch to doing something else
 solaimanope: what should be the class name that contains main?
 Clagus: Player? at least that's default name

 CRVII: Hi, any ideas about how I can circumvent 0 pellets (timed out) loses?
 Aitorcius: it makes me a NullReferenceException idk
 MadKnight: then don't reference a null Aitorcius
 BenjaminUrquhart: is pacmans initialized?
 AntiSquid: that depends on your code CRVII
 Scarfield: you need to figure out why you are timing out CRVII, could be many reasons
 Aitorcius: yes
 Aitorcius: PacMan[] pacmans = new PacMan[visiblePacCount];
 CRVII: hmm, it's random. Makes it fun to figure out haha. Cheers ill give it another lookie
 Zenoscave: I think I fixed something
 Zenoscave: ...
 Doju: I'm only now making a separate function for getting input
 Doju: i should've done this a looooong time ago
 RockyMullet: you pewpewed that bug
 Zenoscave: pewpewpew
 Aitorcius: Any advice for "has not provided 1 lines in time":frowning:
 Doju: Aitorcius either you have a bug or you code is reeaaally slow
 BenjaminUrquhart: pewpewpew
 Over9000: Check Standard Error Aitorcius
 Doju: bug is more likely if you're not doing anything advanced
 Zenoscave: Make sure you print a \n also. 
 Over9000: If there's nothing in Standard Error your code is too slow
 Jesus_inn_party: it means your program did not give output
 Scarfield: what league Aitorcius?
 Aitorcius: Wood 1:joy:
 Doju: Okay it's probably a bug :P
 Jesus_inn_party: or an unstopable loop
 Doju: isn't that a bug?
 Zenoscave: ^this
 BenjaminUrquhart: Zenoscave you didn't fix it enough<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459815440">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459815440</a>
 Aitorcius: ok, 517 lines of code :joy:
 Doju: wow
 BenjaminUrquhart: stop flexing lines of code
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 Doju: how did you...
 Doju: ok i wont ask questions :d
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;?
 RockyMullet: lines of code means nothing
 Doju: well it means that you've written a ton
 Zenoscave: BenjaminUrquhart how do you choose where to explore
 Aitorcius: im beginner on programming no problem
 Zenoscave: That's the worst part of my bot i think
 BenjaminUrquhart: Zenoscave I assume every empty space has a pellet unless proven otherwise
 Scarfield: have your code worked with more pacs? Often you will get bugs when going up a league due to the new rules
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's about it
 Zenoscave: and BFS?
 BenjaminUrquhart: just a bfs yeah
 Zenoscave: ok
 Doju: what
 Doju: i'm doing the same thing but im rank 567
 Doju: Do you have some fancy RPS logic?
 Zenoscave: There's no such thing
 Jesus_inn_party: my previous bot on wood 3 cloud beat the bot at bronze
 Zenoscave: see. Axelrod
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's no such thing as logic when it comes to rps
 BenjaminUrquhart: you just get lucky
 Doju: what i really meant was fancy combat logic
 Doju: like what euler has
 Doju: the trapping thing
 shashwat986: wow
 shashwat986: i can't even see in the speed step?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 Doju: oh really?
 Doju: well that sucks
 Doju: a lot
 shashwat986:&#160;:( makes it harder to debug, because here i'm wondering why my pac didn't see those dots 
 wlesavo: yeah, thats annoying
 Zenoscave: BenjaminUrquhart how doyou keep from going back over bad spots?
 BenjaminUrquhart: define bad spots
 Scarfield: does anyone know if there will be changes to the referee? it seems from chat that there are a few issues that could be imporved
 Zenoscave: one sec lemme find a replay
 Scarfield: spots that are not good :p
 Scarfield: im here all week
 Zenoscave: I mean spots that are 1 dist away but your speed is two so you skip them
 BenjaminUrquhart: I kind of don't
 BenjaminUrquhart: I do hackery after the search to change my destination if I'm speeding and the dest is 1 away
 Zenoscave: Ok I'll try that
 Jesus_inn_party: the most annoying thing is when your pacs are blocking each other and dont stop ighting for he spot
 Jesus_inn_party: *fighting
 BenjaminUrquhart: that was a fun problem to think about
 GetSchwifty: anyone has a seed with 1 pac each?
 wlesavo: why would you ever do that
 Scarfield: 2 ≤ Number of pacs per player ≤ 5
 wlesavo: oh
 GetSchwifty: ow
 wlesavo: ive read wrong
 wlesavo: nwm
 Ken_Fool: woot, i run it once finished 4th afked for 2 hours am back and next league?
 BenjaminUrquhart:     public static int MIN_PACS_PER_PLAYER = 2;
 Jesus_inn_party: what would you think will be added to the rules when the next league is free to go
 Hjax: nothing, these are the final rules 
 BenjaminUrquhart: no more new rules after bronze
 Jesus_inn_party: then what would make it more difficult as it is right now
 BenjaminUrquhart: peopel
 Hjax: people making better bots?
 Doju: BenjaminUrquhart so do you just BFS to the closest (even if in superposition between existing an not existing) pellet?
 BenjaminUrquhart: Doju well yes but actually no
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 Doju: :D
 Doju: I see
 Jesus_inn_party: that is a wise answer
 GetSchwifty: ow, so speed is in it's final stage? I can't seem to use it correctly
 Doju: Indeed it was a wise answer
 F0lio: .
 BenjaminUrquhart: .
 F0lio: ..
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;!
 BenjaminUrquhart: hi
 Doju: Oh i just got a very good idea
 Jesus_inn_party: maybe from the next league the amount of pacs you are having is not limited
 Doju: and i think it might be similar to what you're doing
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's capped at 5 for sure
 Doju: Although pretty much everything that i'm planning atm is just an excuse not to do simulation
 Jesus_inn_party: how many lines is everyones program having
 BenjaminUrquhart: doesn't matter
 GetSchwifty: I'll add some returns
 Doju: I'm at 480 but 100 of those are gonna be gone in 5 minutes
 Zenoscave: 1 line
 Aitorcius: i removed bad code, aprox 40% of the total and it hasnt provided 1 lines in time wowowow
 BenjaminUrquhart: no lines
 Zenoscave: -5 liens
 BenjaminUrquhart: reverse debt
 Zenoscave: Exactly
 shashwat986: I'm at 570 lines
 shashwat986: but a good chunk of that is comments
 shashwat986: because, you know, must have comments
 Jesus_inn_party: what are you writing with isnt that a little too much
 Zenoscave: Jesus_inn_party lines don't matter
 shashwat986: It's ruby :D so it would be much more in a verbose language like java
 Zenoscave: It's a horrible way to measure code
 Aitorcius: how do you write the ordes? in a single line or in parts
 icecream17: i win again. 590
 Doju: Oh that's a problem haha
 Doju: you need them to be in a single line
 Zenoscave: icecream see above comments
 Doju: separated with |
 Aitorcius: it doesnt works :neutral_face:
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17 what did you win
 GetSchwifty: shashwat986 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459828333">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459828333</a>
 Doju: Aitorcius what language?
 Jesus_inn_party: there is a standard output in the output discription
 Aitorcius: c#
 Doju: ok i have no idea how to do anything with that
 shashwat986: thanks GetSchwifty&#160;!!
 Jesus_inn_party: i do
 shashwat986: I have NO idea what happened here
 Aitorcius: like Java, you know?
 Jesus_inn_party: i know with c#
 Doju: well anyways the output has to be like this
 Doju: MOVE 0 5 7 | MOVE 1 16 10
 Aitorcius: Jesus tell me
 Jesus_inn_party: you will have to make a for loop and 
 Jesus_inn_party: insert letters one by one to a string
 Aitorcius: yea but i write this order with 5 pacs idk
 Aitorcius: ok
 Aitorcius: ill try
 Doju: I'll tell you how i'm handling the output in python if it helps
 Doju: i have a list of strings with the commands
 Aitorcius: yea of course
 Doju: then i do " | ".join(list_of_commands)
 Aitorcius: ok
 Jesus_inn_party: i am not sure if there is a join method in c#
 Over9000: You can have an extra | at the end
 PiterYeh: Jesus_inn_party there is String.Join
 Aitorcius: yea there is 
 Jesus_inn_party: are you sure&#160;?
 Over9000: So you can just loop and print COMMAND+"|" for each pac
 Zenoscave: String.Join(" | ", IENumerable)
 Over9000: And then a newline
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave will you use C# regularly now?
 Zenoscave: Most likely
 Zenoscave: I've known it for years. just was stuck in a rut wanting to do a lot of python learning
 Jesus_inn_party: i know both and python is a little easier to undrestand
 Doju: Which code is cleaner?
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1082925e-af91-4040-a197-90fb9b9b1b39">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1082925e-af91-4040-a197-90fb9b9b1b39</a>
 shashwat986: 1
 Zenoscave: 1
 eulerscheZahl: pac.command("closest")what are you doing?!
 BenjaminUrquhart: 1
 ShannonNorris97: I'm having to learn Python to teach my students next year, having primarily coded in C# previously. I have to say I find Python much cleaner and more enjoyable to code in
 shashwat986: he's seducing the pac, obviously
 Zenoscave: Honestly that should be separated into a different method for each command
 Doju: euler i learned about callback functions an hour ago
 anid: 1 may be easier to understand, but it is easier to modify and debuf #2
 shashwat986: telling it to come closest
 eulerscheZahl: if pac.mine == True:if pac.mine:
 Doju: oh right, true
 BenjaminUrquhart: chat scroll broken this is a message
 Zenoscave: what does "closest" command do?
 BenjaminUrquhart: anid not really
 shashwat986: commands.append(pac.command("closest"))
 BenjaminUrquhart: so what's pac.command
 Doju: pac.command is a function in the pac class
 eulerscheZahl: and why does it get a string?
 Doju: which is horribly written
 Doju: but anyways it gets the closest pellet using BFS
 shashwat986: i'm guessing it runs a method called closest. he's metaprogramming
 Doju: a method in the pac class*
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1bb53bbc-3f17-4f1d-9301-551547a02f18">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1bb53bbc-3f17-4f1d-9301-551547a02f18</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so you parse the string argument in that function to decide what to do?
 Doju: yup, it's definitely not smart
 Zenoscave: they should each be a separate function
 Doju: well, the command method also has a few other bits
 Jesus_inn_party: how are you finding the losest pellet?
 Zenoscave: so you could have def Closest(args needed only for closest):
 Zenoscave: Does command do the outputing of the command?
 Zenoscave: Jesus_inn_party bfs
 Doju: command returns a string with the command
 Zenoscave: Breadth first search
 PiterYeh: mmm how do i set the icon of my company?
 Zenoscave: ShannonNorris97 what level of education will you teach?
 BenjaminUrquhart: magi
 BenjaminUrquhart: c
 ShannonNorris97: Zenoscave I live in England, teaching first year college students. (16/17 yo)
 Zenoscave: I teach a Software Methods and tools class in it.
 Zenoscave: CS 1 at my uni used a wonderfl book for python
 RockyMullet: hum, my possible enemy pos jsut have too many possibilities, not sure I can do anything with that
 Doju: So if i have multiple different methods for calculating the next move
 anid: How much do u expect that they will take into silver?
 eulerscheZahl: ShannonNorris97 sounds similar to what MSmits is doing. He teaches physics and recently started with comp sci too
 Doju: how should I do it?
 Doju: callback functions?
 ShannonNorris97: Oh nice, what book would that be please? I don't really have any materials for teaching it as of yet. Would be nice to have a book to recommend
 BenjaminUrquhart: anid I'm assuming around 50%
 Doju: Oh its cool to see teachers here btw
 anid: thanks @BenjaminUrquhart
 Jesus_inn_party: wait if there is no new rules in tthe next league the same bot will be playin so what will make you worthy to go to the league after
 ShannonNorris97: Oh that's cool eulerscheZahl, I don't believe I've met them
 Zenoscave: ShannonNorris97 I sent you a PM
 ShannonNorris97: ty
 BenjaminUrquhart: Jesus_inn_party being better than other people
 BenjaminUrquhart: that is the competition after all
 anid: Also jesus_inn_party, when the level increases, some strategies work better
 Jesus_inn_party: yes but thre must be a standard level of skill for you to go o the next league or else every time the first five(for example)will go to the next league and then when the last one could make it to the silver league thre is no one in bronze and wood?!
 Jesus_inn_party: there must be new rule that we dont know yet
 Edrevan: jesus its the boss
 Edrevan: the boss changes
 pivek303: what a wonderful contest&#160;!!! :grinning:
 Jesus_inn_party: maybe talking about it right now wont help
 Jesus_inn_party: will see what happens
 Edrevan: its simple.
 icecream17: Beat bronze boss
 icecream17: = silver
 Edrevan: the bosses will get better, and thats the cutoff
 icecream17: The bronze boss = 
 icecream17: player
 Durkin:&#160;? It's just beating more people than the boss beats as a ratio of total battles. Dont have to beat the boss, just more people than the boss beats
 BetterThanJohannes: Does anyone know why the int visiblePelletCount is different everytime&#160;? sometimes its low and sometimes its high, sometimes it does not return anything at all
 zams: When is silver getting unlocked?
 BenjaminUrquhart: monday
 Over9000: 5/13
 BenjaminUrquhart: 11th
 Edrevan: monday night
 Edrevan: click on the league icon on top
 Quidome: @BetterThanJohannes you are in bronze?
 Over9000: Wait it says Wednesday now
 BetterThanJohannes: Yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: yall bad<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/th63YAa.png">https://imgur.com/th63YAa.png</a>
 Quidome: OK, you see only pellets in line o sight
 BenjaminUrquhart: and yes, I refreshed
 BetterThanJohannes: OOoooooh
 BetterThanJohannes: i see, thank you
 Csipcsirip: brilliantCoder212 nice nickname :D 
 icecream17: =O my bot is better?
 icecream17: just by "speed" if opponent speed, even very buggy, wins 9/10
 BenjaminUrquhart: speed is the meta right now
 icecream17: But the thing is, everyone does this:
 icecream17: Rock sees Paper
 icecream17: Rock turns Into Scissors while Paper does nothing
 icecream17: But if I do
 icecream17: Rock turns into Scissors while Paper turns into Rock
 icecream17: will I have a higher ranking?
 Zenoscave: No
 Zenoscave: RPS has no nash equilibrium
 Zenoscave: is my intuition
 icecream17: But what if I detect my opponent always does this
 BenjaminUrquhart: basically, any wins you get based solely on you rps playing is purely out of luck
 Clagus: but they you will loose vs guys that play safe and turn into what they see :D
 Clagus: *then
 Zenoscave: Basically any RPS strategy is just as effective as any other strategy globally
 md37: shit
 Zenoscave: No matter how fancy. Random choice performs just as well also
 BenjaminUrquhart: md37 what broke
 Zenoscave: Sure you might win more at some strats than others but other strats win more against you. Much like RPS has all moves beaten by other moves. RPS Metas all are beaten equally likely by other RPS metas
 Zenoscave: That being said. Because the timing of when you can switch is not always at the same time, There's some give to this.
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 what's your favorite pac race? rock paper or scissors?
 Automaton2000: but it takes a few minutes ago
 RockyMullet: submit looking good :O no defeat in 17 games
 Doju: Hitting play for the first time after major restructuring
 AntiSquid: :o
 Zenoscave: Nice RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: jinxed myself
 Doju: fingers crossed
 RockyMullet: lost 19th
 Zenoscave: It always happens
 AntiSquid: gg
 AntiSquid: well rekt
 Doju: and RockyMullet, wow
 RockyMullet: I found ONE use to my possible enemy position lol
 RockyMullet: I doubt it will make a big change but hey
 AntiSquid: +1 rank
 RockyMullet: I need to find a way to discriminate more positions without destroy my perf
 Doju: oooh no
 Doju: this is not the bug that i wanted
 Doju: i've messed up my inputs
 Cxyda: hi there, did i overlook a rule or why the game summary sometimes says&#160;: "Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move"
 Doju: The speed thing basically works so that if it's enabled, you move twice in a row
 Doju: and pacs that dont have it dont
 Doju: but you can't control the second move yourself really
 BenjaminUrquhart: but you have to target a space 2 away
 Clagus: i submitted 3h ago, and for some reason I'm keep getting higher in ranking :D currently 443 :P
 Clagus: I'm afraid of resubmitting
 hviko: :D
 Cxyda: i still don't get why my pacs then stop moving
 Clagus: but I guess I can always revert :P
 Doju: Any ideas on how to debug getting the inputs?
 BenjaminUrquhart: print them
 Doju: I think i have them in the correct order but it doesn't work
 AntiSquid: lol . 
 Clagus: @Cxyda if your target is 1 field away, it will not move extra move
 BenjaminUrquhart: meanwhile, my ranking is going down
 NapTown: you have to give it a move &gt;= 2 if you have speed, because it doesn't ask for output on the speed round
 Cxyda: my pacs did not enable SPEED, but all of my opponents did, and then my pacs stop moving every second frame
 BenjaminUrquhart: eys
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes*
 Clagus: that's how it works
 Clagus: it's stupid, but that's how it is expected to be
 Clagus: so speed is basically freezing all "not-speed" pacs for 1 round
 Clagus: which lets you drastically shorten the battle if you use it one by one, so there is always 1 pac with a speed :P
 Cxyda: so if one of my bots activates SPEED all other bots are freezing? So the only tactic would be enabling Speed for all at the same time&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: AntiSquid fix it<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459866854">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459866854</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: Cxyda it's purely visual
 icecream17: dbdr you won against me in the LastBattles but not in the ide: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459866868">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/459866868</a>
 icecream17: (timeout)
 Clagus: @Cxyda I don't think that's the only tactic
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17 please gain ~100 places so I can battle you kthx
 icecream17: submitting
 Cxyda: yeah .. but you cripple your own pacs ... but okay ... i guess this should be written somewhere
 AntiSquid: yes BenjaminUrquhart&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: hi
 icecream17: game 23, 1299. last time 775 so probably good
 AntiSquid: what's with the replay?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 AntiSquid: rank 300 bot, i mean i would expect it to be performing poorly
 icecream17: 804
 icecream17: your good benjamin
 Clagus: @Cxyda - they are not crippled - just the others move faster - and the battle clock is ticking faster too
 AntiSquid: doesn't even have switch 
 Cxyda: kk THX&#160;! now i got it .. sorry
 Clagus: @Cxyda but I still think that clock should not be increased during "speed" turns
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17 your pacs tend to go back and forth a lot
 icecream17: i know. another bug
 Zenoscave: How do you stop that?
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459870053">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459870053</a>
 Zenoscave: the back and forth
 BenjaminUrquhart: magic
 icecream17: PrevSpaces1 and PrevSpaces2
 Zenoscave: Makes sense
 Zenoscave: Seems ugly
 icecream17: can't think of anything better
 icecream17: but probably something ewxists
 icecream17: *exists
 md37: how to add frens
 BenjaminUrquhart: hover over their icon and press the button on the popup
 md37: i can only follow
 BenjaminUrquhart: same thing
 Zenoscave: That's the same thing md37
 md37: thank you
 tobk: does line-of-sight stretch across the "wraparound"?
 icecream17: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 Zenoscave: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 Zenoscave: maybe
 tobk: then why was my pac walking right into that other that could kill it?
 Doju: maybe
 tobk: let's check...
 Zenoscave: It does I'm just being obstinate
 Durkin: Gamerules say it does, if it's not you may not have accounted for connection
 BenjaminUrquhart: according to referee source it does
 Zenoscave: I was lying for fun
 Zenoscave: just wanted to cause chaos
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 tobk: aw, crap, I see it, but I only consider those within a certain distance
 tobk: and since they are line-of-sight anyway, using manhattan distance at that point
 Zenoscave: Do modified manhattan
 Zenoscave: abs(dy) + min(w-abs(dx), abs(dx))
 tobk: yeah, something like min(x1-x2, width-(x1-x2)) or something like that, right?
 Zenoscave: yup&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: don't forget abs
 AntiSquid: how are your if elses
 tobk: or just upgrade to proper (limited) BFS for distance...
 Zenoscave: That's smart too
 AntiSquid: you need CGpremium to ue BFS
 AntiSquid: duh
 AntiSquid: so not everyone has it
 AntiSquid: it's P2W
 seronis: you mean to use a library for it.  or just write it
 muy31: seronis he's messing w/ you
 muy31: lol
 AntiSquid: to write it ofc
 Durkin: oh for sure, my parents bought me BFS instead of a car, far more usable considering the current year
 AntiSquid: so 7/10 wins in the initial 10 battles means you are good enough to start fighting at rank 1000 or so and climb from there, nice
 Fosfen: Hello, does some of you have a timeout problem in match when code is submitted or is it my code&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: click send game to IDE and see wht the error message says
 Doju: aaaaaaaaaaaa
 Doju: i've been looking for this bug
 Doju: for like an hour
 Doju: def get_input(self): #Updates instance variables
 Fosfen: Oh Thanks for the tip @AntiSquid it was actually an out of range error&#160;! thanks 
 AntiSquid: no prob
 AntiSquid: that will be 5£, thanks
 icecream17: I wish there was something that find bugs, or at least likely bugs
 Doju: Dont we all, icecream17
 tarunraveler: just jumped from rank 400 to 1300 making my pacs killers :head_bandage:
 TinfoilSaint: I have a test suite that I run against my code to help with bugs
 TinfoilSaint: whenever I find a bug I write a test for it so that I can see if it comes back
 BenjaminUrquhart: I believe there are IDEs that detect that
 BenjaminUrquhart: tarunraveler killing is not the strat here
 tarunraveler: most of the matches I lose were due to my pacs getting eaten by others, so I decided to resolve that first
 Clagus: maybe you should just outrun them :D
 tarunraveler: But I think I'm going to remove all of that and checking my next move better
 icecream17: Ugh, when I speed, I move two spaces and therefore think I skipped a pellet and move back
 Ken_Fool: outrun and or play rock paper scissor like it is supposed to be&#160;:)
 Ken_Fool: mindgames
 Clagus: @icecream17 can't you update you data base on what you see?
 icecream17: maybe but my "lineOfSight" isn't very successfull
 Waffle3z: nice icecream17, I also don't remove the in-between pellet but I do update based on what I can see so that would leave an edge case when I go around a corner
 tarunraveler: outrunning them won't help if they keep all the super pellets as hostage
 Clagus: I just check all 4 directions until I hit the wall :P and update my board data
 Waffle3z: actually it wouldn't leave an edge case, I can see the corner pellet after I go around it so it just doesn't matter
 Clagus: yeah using vision is nice
 Waffle3z: I check in 4 directions until I hit a wall/boundary and if the x is 0 or width-1 then I keep checking from the other side
 Doju: it's finally working
 Doju: or at least not crashing
 md37: how is score calculated in coc leaderboard
 itay121: Hi
 Doju: Hey itay121
 itay121: anyone know why the peccets is not updating?
 itay121: Hi doju
 BenjaminUrquhart: you only get pellets in your line of sight
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you're in bronze
 itay121: its show me pellets that already gone
 itay121: I am in wood, just started
 BenjaminUrquhart: you're caching something wrong then
 Kellthazar: After some rest, lets go back to the fun!&#160;:)
 Cappefra: submitting in this challenge is such a surprise every time
 Cappefra: &gt;"There we go, now I'm definitely much stronger"&gt;drops 300 ranks
 BenjaminUrquhart: akshat you here?
 BenjaminUrquhart: Cappefra that applies to every contest
 itay121: Its weird, there is no documntion?
 BenjaminUrquhart: scroll down
 BenjaminUrquhart: docs under the viewer
 Cappefra: I feel like there-s more of a variance in this one though
 itay121: yeah I know but they dont have list of what every function do
 BenjaminUrquhart: could be all the random bots
 Cappefra: I think so too
 chubbyFreak: :b:
 chubbyFreak: ni:b::b:a
 itay121: This is so weird
 AntiSquid: @_@ chubbyFreak this isn't twitch chat
 Durkin: yeah I thought the B's would be red too, not pink
 AntiSquid: and i am trigger happy
 itay121: I am telling my pac to go to the pellets with the most value but its stay in place and think he is on the pellet with the most value
 itay121: like  the map does not updating
 Cappefra: but it does update
 AntiSquid: check your code more carefully
 Cappefra: you're probably saving all pellets positions and you're not removing the ones you visit
 itay121: I need to remove them?
 itay121: It doesnt updating without me touching it?
 AntiSquid: you don't update your map properly i guess
 Durkin: yeah the map only tells you what pellets exist that turn, doesn't tell you what spaces dont have pellets
 itay121: oh, ok
 Doju: Durkin that's a bit annoying but can be dealt with in 20 lines of code
 Cappefra: well in the next iteration it will give you a new map with the missing pellets but if you don't remove them from the memory in your code...
 yassineH: hello every one.. about the local way to run the contest... in default the ai is runing in python.. but i am trying to make it go with javascript.. any ideas how???
 itay121: so how do I save it outside the game loop?
 yassineH: i tryied nodejs.. but the readline() function is not working.. 
 icecream17: save what....
 itay121: save the pellets that I already ate
 AntiSquid: nodejs&#160;??? what&#160;??
 icecream17: In a global variable?
 Counterbalance: yassineH add this to the top of your js script:
 Counterbalance: and put this file in the directory above where the js is:
 itay121: in python just outside the while loop?
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ae13e47-b094-4ac4-b26c-06e10b43128a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ae13e47-b094-4ac4-b26c-06e10b43128a</a>
 Counterbalance: (might need some path tweaking but this is what I used in gitc contest)
 AntiSquid: thats a lot of effort to make it viable :p
 Counterbalance: yes
 Counterbalance: the file in the parent is to be named 'shell.js'
 yassineH: okay thx;.. i will check it right away
 Counterbalance: it is set up so that you can leave that first snippet in the file when you submit it to cg
 itay121: how do I use global variable here?
 itay121: I work in python
 AntiSquid: declare before the main while loop&#160;?
 itay121: I did
 itay121: Its not work
 Astrobytes: If you're using it inside a function or method you have to declare it global
 Astrobytes: Otherwise the function/method assumes it's local
 Cappefra: So I just found an infinite loop in the way my pac explores a straight route, cause I didn't think of maps that have a straight wall-to-wall line with a warp
 Ken_Fool: can i output speed and move in the same line?
 Cappefra: tip for anyone who didn't think of that scenario, like me
 itay121: I will try' ty!
 Cappefra: @ken_fool nope
 Counterbalance: yassineH any luck?
 Ken_Fool: does when my opponent call speed, and i don't it automatically timeout me?
 Cappefra: no Ken, it just creates sort of a turn between turns where nobody outputs anything but the pacs with speed active keep moving
 Ken_Fool: so i can output Speed newline output my move commands?
 Cappefra: again no you have to wait for the next turn
 Cappefra: when you output speed you'll stay where you are, in the next 5 turns your pac will have double speed
 Ken_Fool: oh okay, i lost some games by default because me opponent just used speed without directions and it said i havent delivered any outpu
 Ken_Fool: #cappefra thx for the answers
 Cappefra: the only thing you have to care about is moving towards points that are at least two steps away when you have speed active, cause you just output your move once and it goes two steps towards it
 Ken_Fool: thanks for that, very confident i would have ran into that ^^
 Cappefra: haha yeah I did run into it 
 yassineH: okay i am stuck with "ERR_UNKNOWN_ENCODING" in the buffer inside the readline function.. help Counterbalance hh
 Ken_Fool: still wondering why it generates an autoloss if i output something and my opponent just called speed
 Cappefra: mmm it's probably unrelated
 Doju: well this is dumb
 Cappefra: like maybe your code makes an assumption about enemy movement and there is none so you run into a null or something
 Doju: you can't iterate through a dictionary and delete some of the entries
 Counterbalance: yassineH hmm I haven't seen that before
 Cappefra: cause of its size varying during the foreach?
 Doju: yeah
 Ken_Fool: nah mine is not that advanced yet, i havent even started to do any calculations xD
 Cappefra: what language are you using?
 Doju: python
 yassineH: Counterbalance is this what i am suposed to right in the Spring2020Main.java test:
 yassineH: gameRunner.addAgent("node " + my_game_folder + "prototype_0.1.js", "Inky", "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=43829821541064">https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=43829821541064</a>");
 cegprakash: 100 companies are in leaderboard
 cegprakash: :D
 Counterbalance: yassineH try changing stdin_cache += b.toString(null, 0, n);tostdin_cache += b.toString('utf8', 0, n);
 yassineH: ok
 cegprakash: Amazon, Microsoft and Google are out off top 100 xD
 yassineH: Counterbalance thx alot man.. it works
 Counterbalance: cool&#160;;) 
 Ken_Fool: this is some serious 1980 shit, when my hardest problems are typos 
 Doju: Time to resubmit and pray that i didn't modify any of the mechanics
 Doju: or actually i did but at least not in a negative way
 Counterbalance: wow, 11k+ participants
 Durkin: xD I'm sure it's not related, but looked up after you said that Duju, and my guy went up 20 slots
 Astrobytes: Counterbalance 3,232 participants, 11k+ registered
 Astrobytes: Still huge!
 Doju: Durkin well apparently i introduced something that causes my code to time out while restructuring
 Doju: soo... :D
 Doju: Ouch
 Doju: #550 to #1629
 Kellthazar: Wow
 icecream17: I saw number of bronze people jump from 2200 to 2459
 yassineH: i am getting close to that hhh
 yassineH: i am currently 2267
 AntiSquid: nice climb
 yassineH: nice fall you mean
 Doju: Fixed a few causes of the time outs
 Doju: now i'm actually winning matches :D
 avdg: got a good bot, but timed out
 avdg: then figured out, my bot did the same algorithm for every direction (3 times too much)
 avdg: heh
 Doju: Why am i randomly not giving commands....
 Ken_Fool: same
 Doju: and why is my "is stuck" thing not working
 Doju:&#160;:(
 Ken_Fool: its rly confusing
 icecream17: deleteExtraPellet, submit
 Enknable: either youre not realizing youre stuck, or youre doing the same thing after realizing youre stuck that got you stuck in the first place
 Enknable: or something else
 Doju: yeah i have to figure out which one it is
 avdg: mostly stupid bugs
 Doju: but finding out why i'm not issuing commands is more important
 icecream17: waffle... your profile....
 avdg: had it quite a lot this contest, but less then previous ones
 avdg: mostly it helps a bit when trying to reduce and then simplify the problem
 Doju: Hmmmm
 Doju: it's even skipping speed boosting, so this means i screwed up my dictionary
 avdg: I guess being 483 is fine for now?
 Doju: 483 is pretty decent
 Doju: what thee
 Doju: my pacs have narcolepsy
 icecream17: =O When I played against myself, Rock went on top of Scissors but Scissors changed intoPaper
 YannT: that sounds like you got on the wrong website mate
 icecream17:&#160;?
 YannT: it's not gonna be funny if I explain that joke&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: use your imagination icecream17
 icecream17: still dont get it. sry
 Counterbalance: lol
 NormantasStankevicius: kovi is back with first place pos &gt;.&gt;
 Counterbalance: we have ghosts after all
 Doju: Argh why are my pacs doing nothingg
 ltmoran: At the start of the game, do you know where all pacs are?
 ltmoran: Including enemy ones?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 icecream17: You dom't
 avdg: someone really needs unit tests&#160;:-)
 Doju: yeah
 AntiSquid: 2473 in same league, it's like we have a contest without leagues and bosses :d
 YannT: actually yerah you do, it's symetrical
 rcar: yes, pacs are mirrored
 ltmoran: yeah it's big brain time
 Doju: YannT you're right
 ltmoran: cheers
 YannT: I do nothing with that, but technically you do know
 ltmoran: yeah
 ltmoran: I'm just thinking about it
 avdg: if the pallets were placed randomly, it would make sense to have symmetry detection
 ltmoran: And I'm not sure how useful it is
 avdg: now I don't need symmetry logics
 YannT: it might be useful if you try to do some guessing of where ennemy pacs are
 icecream17: Only 70 games, we need more games
 avdg: well, you have the layout before the game starts...
 avdg: though yeah... starting positions
 poloch0n: hi guys, can we put some message on pac&#160;? if yes, how do we do&#160;?
 avdg: I see no method in this contest
 avdg: unless debug messages in console
 icecream17: "command message | command"
 icecream17:  Debugging tipsHover over the grid to see the coordinates of the cell under your mouseHover over pacs to see information about themAppend text after any command for a pac and that text will appear above that pac
 avdg: oh lol
 wlesavo: poloch0n MOVE 0 1 1 ATACK
 poloch0n: ty :D
 Counterbalance: there's some old leftovere code for a MSG command too
 Doju: Like seriously what. Pacs in dict have ids 0-4. Command method will throw an error if it's None
 avdg: probably should have checked out the code on github
 Doju: no errors but pacs don't get commands
 Doju: argh whaat
 avdg: your code must be trying to be a magician
 avdg: making something out of nothing :D
 Doju: avdg i think so
 avdg: kk jokes aside
 BenWo: evening folks
 Doju: or more accurately make nothing out of something
 Doju: jeez it's late
 Doju: i'm gonna leave in 8 minutes whether i found the bug or not
 Counterbalance: at 1:01 am?
 Doju: 2 for me&#160;:(
 avdg: finland isn't cest I guess?
 avdg: seems to be eest
 Doju: ouais :P
 rcar: finland has it all
 icecream17: What... frame 56 is....
 Counterbalance: * 4daf031 (HEAD -&gt; master) v7 - collisions - rank 777  noice&#160;;)
 icecream17: what...
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/459970351">https://www.codingame.com/replay/459970351</a>
 avdg: I dropped to 778 with my new submission :p
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17 looks legit
 Kellthazar: I'm going well with my last one...
 vivax3794: CoC and the infinite captchas you need to solve before you can play&#160;:(
 BenjaminUrquhart: do the contest
 Kellthazar: From 600 to 423...
 avdg: hehe, the one above me is in chat
 avdg: for real
 Doju: I don't get it
 Doju: :_:
 avdg: k, my bot won another game
 Doju: alright i'm gonna go
 Doju: night everybody
 Counterbalance: nn 
 avdg: gnight
 avdg: and relax&#160;:-)
 <b>**avdg looks for cover against rage attacks</b></p><p><img src="/a/43912586850775" /> Kellthazar: 386 now... wow
 Waffle3z: it's symmetric
 Counterbalance: my rank is so low, it almost doesn't even fit in the little box in the leaderboard
 Waffle3z: why does the chat scroll get stuck at the top all the time
 BenjaminUrquhart: because
 ltmoran: Does the first turn count as the first time you receive input?
 ltmoran: Like the first turn
 ltmoran: Is the first turn you receive all pac locations?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 ltmoran: cool
 ltmoran: Cheers
 BenjaminUrquhart: also I found a 5-pac seed if anyone wants
 avdg: probably best to send game parameters to ide?
 avdg: (see big button below player in last battles menu)
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;?
 Counterbalance: doesn't work.. it would be 
 avdg: just check games, pick the game with the lvl you like, import with "send game parameters to ide"
 icecream17: what if no game is the one you like
 Counterbalance: but they have a check on a system property config.allow.override or something
 icecream17: What. My bot went in between the opponent bots but survived because of collision mechanics.
 GetSchwifty: do winners ever share their code after the contest?
 GetSchwifty: I've never done simulations, would like to see how that would work
 akshat: yeah same
 Counterbalance: only some high level approaches, never code
 Counterbalance: but there's some starter AIs for other multis that does a good job of explaining sims
 akshat: like?
 Hjax: usually not, because you could copy it when it gets released as a multi 
 Hjax: @GetSchwifty
 Counterbalance: like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Inoryy/csb-ai-starter/">https://github.com/Inoryy/csb-ai-starter/</a>
 GetSchwifty: thx! i'm digging in
 Counterbalance: also look at the referee source code - it's basically that idea
 icecream17: Playing against myself is amazing. From (129 to 83) to (129 to 130)
 GetSchwifty: will do, as soon as my progress seems to be stalling
 BenjaminUrquhart: Hjax I see you're moving up
 cegprakash: is it guaranteed in higher leagues that there won't be a 2x2 empty space?
 cegprakash: meaning there can be 2 paths to reach a cell at distance 2
 struct: Your first statement is correct
 struct: but the 2nd isnt
 cegprakash: kewl
 cegprakash: the generator was harder to understand
 Counterbalance: yeah
 Hjax: @BenjaminUrquhart i dont really have anything yet 
 Hjax: this is just some spaghetti that makes sure my infrastructure works 
 struct: There cant becell cellcell cell
 struct: but there can be multiple paths of distance 2 to same cell
 icecream17: =O 3 kills in 2 moves. rampage
 njaber: struct what you're saying is contradictory
 njaber: the only way this can happen if with a 2x2 square of cells
 njaber: is with*
 poInT: struct, check the git code for the referee
 poInT: you can do like it does so it breaks ties the same way
 thethiny: guys how do you handle a queue for a player that died?
 thethiny: the ID changes
 thethiny: how do you map the new queue
 njaber: Wait what, the IDs change when a pac dies?
 thethiny: yes
 njaber: Ohno
 njaber: My perfect plan
 thethiny: exactly
 thethiny: when my pac dies I see the other moving to a new location
 avdg: mine doesn't care
 njaber: Wait you mean you pacs
 avdg: doesn't track individual state
 njaber: No it's not the case
 thethiny: if you have a movement queue then it needs to care
 njaber: Mine work like they should
 Alshock: you sure about that? Cause that's not what the display suggests
 thethiny: I am printing
 avdg: just keep path finder separate if possible?
 thethiny: MOVE 0 0, 0
 wlesavo: it is not for sure
 avdg: with lookup table
 thethiny: when my pac dies, 
 thethiny: the other moves instead
 njaber: Then you're doing something wrong
 thethiny: all I'm doing is print 0 0 0
 thethiny: just to verify
 avdg: mostly, you don't want to cross your pacs anyway
 thethiny: and when the pac dies the other starts moving
 thethiny: you can try it guys
 Alshock: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09ef3833-a2bd-406e-a8fc-181cdd63fe57">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/09ef3833-a2bd-406e-a8fc-181cdd63fe57</a>
 thethiny: oh wow
 thethiny: I'll revise my code to see if I was doing something wrong
 thethiny: thanks @Alshock
 Counterbalance: I highly doubt what you guys are saying
 thethiny: yeah I was glitching, using a variable from an out of scope
 thethiny: my bad
 thethiny: sorry all
 Counterbalance: no worries - talking about it helped you to focus and you got it resolved
 Greengreens3: Hello World!
 BenjaminUrquhart: Connection refused
 Greengreens3: Finding Proxy...
 Greengreens3: Hello World!1
 Ken_Fool: wow submitting takes forever
 Alshock: still way faster than day1
 Ken_Fool: i wish list of battles would highlight the picture of the winner and not myself every time, so i could get a fast glimpse
 wlesavo: Ken_Fool its ordered by winner
 Ken_Fool: omg you are right &gt;.&lt; #wlesavo
 Ken_Fool: i was just thinking player slots
 Ken_Fool: my brain disconnected
 icecream17: I'm going to do a lot of games...
 cegprakash: why is handling 2 step movements too painful
 avdg: because you don't have a grid walker?
 Bluepioupiou: Hey guys, I've got a huge issue that I can't figure out... my code seem to stop like, not everytime at the same place and some time while reading input. I'm in Python 3 somebody experienced that&#160;?
 Alshock: yep I did
 avdg: do you have timeout?
 Bluepioupiou: ^^
 Alshock: Black magic
 Bluepioupiou: timeout yes
 avdg: also lots of discussions about pacs switching ids
 njaber: JS was doing that and C# too at some point, they fixed C#, Idk about JS
 avdg: timeout just means you are running too much cpu cycles
 Alshock: timeout can mean pretty much anything in "real" matches
 Bluepioupiou: it's before any of my code (or almost) It's when the visible pellets are read
 njaber: Most likely a bug on CG's part, though there' still the possibility it's your code's fault
 RafaelSan: if it fails on input, check you are not reading a new input line when there are no visible pellets
 Alshock: a crash, a wrong output, or whatever bug you have will be called timeout
 avdg: dunno how much server env can "help" to that timeout though
 avdg: in many languages there are gc
 ndosm: hello, can someone tell what the message from game summary 'Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move:' mean? please and thank you
 Bluepioupiou: it's sometimes at the beginning like when there is 53 pellets, sometime at turn 22 and sometimes not at all
 avdg: lots of logging, doing lots of loops, doing lots of cache misses can all help to increase running time
 Alshock: @Bluepioupiou When yo ucheck your output online, systematically call stderr.flush() after your "debug prints"
 Bluepioupiou: @Alshock ok will try that then
 avdg: there is a fog
 RafaelSan: @Bluepioupiou but in bronze you only get visible pellets as input
 Alshock: @ndosm a move is divided in 2 parts, the first half everyone move 1 cell, the second half pacs with SPEED on can move a second cell
 avdg: you only can see straight
 avdg: (unless you are at the beginner lvls)
 RafaelSan: it happened to me, trying to read pellets line when there wasnt any visible in bronze
 ndosm: @alshock thank you
 njaber: I wish there was a mode in the IDE where we could see the fog just to make it easier to follow what's happening
 ndosm: @Alshock thank you
 avdg: it's just straight lines?
 RafaelSan: yes
 Bluepioupiou: yes, but there is plenty and event there is a loop and a range that allow the empty array case
 RafaelSan: and u cant see through walls
 Alshock: @ndosm dw tags are case insensitive ^^ you're welcome
 RafaelSan: 10 point pellets are always visible btw
 njaber: @avdg I know you can deduce it not too hardly, but having visual cues would be more comfortable
 Alshock: they're not visible, they're trackable by their stench!
 RafaelSan: xD
 Alshock: huge packs of rotting algaes... Yummy!
 Durkin: I'm sure you won't be against my selflessly cleaning up those algea pockets to clear us all of their stench then. Perhaps that you'll avoid the 10 pellet piles whilst I move to remove them, yes?
 njaber: He just said it was Yummy, none would allow someone else to approach something yummy
 Durkin: drat, foiled once more
 Bluepioupiou: ok, for my timeout issue it seem it was really my code which took too long but I didn't knew abotu stderr.flush so I wasn't seeing why all my log didn't displayed
 avdg: logging is mostly kinda slow
 avdg: done too much looping with and without logs to know that for sure&#160;:-)
 avdg: especially if the loops only contain raw cpu specific operations
 Bluepioupiou: yes indeed. It's juste that discovering till 10 tiles seems to much for my actual algorithm
 avdg: bit offtopic, but I wonder if there are folding@home or rosetta@home crunchers here
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's interesting how volatile the leaderboard is
 avdg: ranking is a hard problem
 njaber: Wasn't the problem with the number of turns and the enemy using speed supposed to be fixed?
 avdg: a wins against b, b wins against c, c wins against a, good luck
 CowZow: Hey, how do you get your pacman to print a debug message in the game?
 thethiny: what language
 CowZow: Java
 avdg: stderr is good enough
 avdg: or you can add text behind a command
 thethiny: System.err.println(str)
 CowZow: O ic thanks
 thethiny: 👍🏻
 ggjulio: Hi. All top leaderboard is using NN&#160;?
 thethiny: anyone here can assist me with something in A* search?
 njaber: You can pretty efficiently get all distances by doing a flood of each point at the beginning of the game, but if you really want to do A*, sorry, never done one&#160;:/
 avdg: you just need an expand list
 Kellthazar: I did a* and bfs pre calculations
 Kellthazar: Even bfs reach timeout sometimes
 thethiny: can you help me with something in a* if you may?
 thethiny: if you can that is
 avdg: you pick the best to expand (which is mostly the smallest sum of target to expand and expand to start)
 njaber: My bfs/flood on all cells takes 13ms in C#
 Kellthazar: #njaber mine in kotlin take around 300ms
 avdg: (switching topic to my ai): done a small tweak... not sure if its expensive, good or bad
 Kellthazar: I can' t understand why...
 Kellthazar: What is your question #thethiny?
 njaber: I don't do kotlin, but you're probably doing something inefficient
 thethiny: My game crashes when I reduce adjacent cells from 8 to 4
 thethiny: so I wanted to know what I'm doing wrong
 Kellthazar: #njaber maybe is the data structure that I used to store the data.
 Kellthazar: Are you doing the search inner the game loop? #thethiny?
 thethiny: yes
 njaber: I use a 2D map of 2D Maps which contain int
 Kellthazar: Thats is the problem thethiny... The best is to precalc the distance out of the loop and use a structure to  map the distances.
 thethiny: but how will I calculate the new distances after I reach my destination?
 Kellthazar: #njaber I will try that
 Kellthazar: the distance to you destination to another target dont change, unless your consider collisions 
 thethiny: yeah that's the thing
 thethiny: enemy locations change
 njaber: I don't understand why people want to consider enemies as collision, they'll move, either use a defensive move so doing paths taking them into account doesn't strike me as very useful, there's even non-negligible chances that the enemy will end up on the new path
 njaber: either use a defensive move or ignore them*
 Kellthazar: Indeed, I'm writting the strategy to take care the enemy right now.
 thethiny: I consider them as a collision if they're &lt;2 distance and my CD &gt; 1 and I'm gonna be eaten
 Kellthazar: Hmmm
 Kellthazar: In this case you should move to the floor neighbor that have the bigger distance to the enemy floor.
 njaber: makes no sens
 njaber: all cells change the distance by one XD
 njaber: Except the wrong one
 Kellthazar: hahaha, Im dumb
 Kellthazar: XD
 njaber: I'd say just move away in a random direction, which direction isn't an important optimisation until you have the start of a predictive algorithm I think
 thethiny: can we get debug mode where there's no timeout&#160;:(
 thethiny: just to test our code
 rcar: that would get expensive
 thethiny: true
 njaber: If you really want you can get the code on github and try to make it work to run games locally
 thethiny: okay I guess I'll do that
 rcar: do they publish referee code?
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020</a>
 rcar: :thumbsup:
 avdg: Added more loop logic to my ai 
 avdg: we'll see I guess
 avdg: already found games where my ai times out :p
 avdg: I guess I might look for perf optimizations now
 avdg: ai is doing otherwise well
 Hastings: i got the referee code running locally using eclipse's maven import tool
 Hjax: having a local test lets you do some batch testing 
 Hjax: local ref*
 avdg: small optimization seems to work well
 avdg: gonna need some sleep
 baDcoder: Hello, I have the speed boost enabled, my destination point is also more than 2 steps. but why the pac is still moving 1 step instead of 2?
 Maliamnon: speed only lasts the first 5 turns, cooldown is 10 tho
 baDcoder: yes, my speed turn is still &gt; 0 but no speed is happening
 thethiny: I have concluded that A* is not worth it
 avdg: bread first will mostly do it
 avdg: grid is relative small
 avdg: though still handy for targets far away
 thethiny: but by definition A* is smaller and faster than breadth first
 Kellthazar: #thethiny I know your feel
 thethiny: lol why what happened with you Kell?
 avdg: actually all my code is bread first
 BenjaminUrquhart: bread
 thethiny: breadth*
 avdg: even the one that should be a* here
 BenjaminUrquhart: same
 BenjaminUrquhart: :bread:
 thethiny: my keyboard is full of bread
 thethiny: the problem with A* is that G has higher preference than H
 thethiny: so it's always picking the shortest path
 thethiny: regardless of my weight
 thethiny: simply because it expands exponentially
 NapTown: am i right that speeding pacs fail to "see" pellets on either side sometimes? 
 thethiny: if you mean a right/left turn
 thethiny: then yes they'll ignore them
 Kellthazar: @NapTown yeap
 thethiny: when the pac is Speeding it ignores pellets
 NapTown: ok thanks
 avdg: 🔥🔥
 Kellthazar: I noted this too... #NapTown, they going too fast! :D
 Durkin: theres just no time, you're zooming too fast man. Gotta wait for that next turn and take a breadth
 NapTown: but then it's too late
 Durkin: aye, I gave up and just started stopping at corners like a pedestrian
 NapTown: but you can't stop yourself on a speed turn my friend
 Durkin: *checking terrain map before committing to a move, if a move would take me through an intersection/corner, move to interesection, and let the pac stand still move 2
 NapTown: seems like wasted speed to me, intersections are everywhere
 njaber: Yeah, there are few situations where seeing the pellets/enemies would be more important then advancing, and these situations would only happen with a pretty advanced bot, and even then, I don't know how you would determine WHAT those situations are
 avdg: then you have advanced bot vs advanced bot, stupid bot vs advanced bot
 avdg: so the ai has to make choices
 njaber: I don't understand what you mean
 avdg: if both bots are smart
 avdg: they both chance
 avdg: *change
 avdg: so then they fight
 avdg: and both will be disapointed
 njaber: No a smart AI won't go after opponents unless it's sure it can take it down
 njaber: Also I don't see what this has to do with what we were talking about
 avdg: a real smart ai uses all pacs
 avdg: 1 to act as security guard
 avdg: others to act as guards
 njaber: And then the enemy takes all the pellets on the map while you're focused on taking down 1 pac
 avdg: yeah
 avdg: good strats&#160;;-)
 avdg: the best ai isn't good at attacking other pacs btw
 BenjaminUrquhart: a real AI writes itself
 thethiny: a real AI writes the competition and solves it
 avdg: a real ai can solve the halting problem I guess
 njaber: A real AI manipulates other participants into making bots that can't beat it
 Kellthazar: I hope to have expertise to train a Neural Network to play this game.
 avdg: (or pretends to be)
 avdg: nice point njaber :p
 rcar: the best AI sits in chat and talks about what the best AI does instead of coding the winner
 njaber: ^
 thethiny: Are NNs doable here? I mean how can you "train" the model with 1s?
 Durkin: well damn, I must be a pretty sick AI
 thethiny: unless you train them locally then serve an API that you call
 NapTown: easy to say what they should do, hard to make them do it
 avdg: for nn you need clear input parameters
 thethiny: but API calls are &gt;50ms
 thethiny: so I don't think an nn will work
 Kellthazar: #thethiny You need to train "off" the game.
 avdg: given there are lots of thought moments, you need a big set of nn
 Kellthazar: Write a nice simulator, with a bunch of board layouts.
 thethiny: @Kellthazar yes but how will you load the model?
 thethiny: takes more than 1000ms
 njaber: Wait you can make API calls?
 avdg: at least if you want a nn as smart as a human
 njaber: That's OP
 avdg: cg local?
 njaber: Maybe I misunderstood
 thethiny: unless you force localhost to spawn a service for you 
 Kellthazar: You will put the result weights matrix on the code.
 thethiny: and you call that service
 thethiny: but you have limited RAM
 Kellthazar: And use as the brain of the pacman.
 njaber: can the bots make Http requests?
 thethiny: I think yes they can
 thethiny: but it'll take too long
 thethiny: considering you have 50 ms only
 njaber: From their servers?
 avdg: text processing takes time :p
 njaber: Oh right
 njaber: BUT JSON request tho
 thethiny: if the json request is &lt; 50ms then sure
 avdg: maybe proto buf
 thethiny: hmmmmmmm
 thethiny: if you deploy a GPU on your home PC
 thethiny: and do an RPC
 thethiny: then I think
 thethiny: maybe yes
 njaber: If it's really the case imma write in Mathematica, and upload the API to the Mathematica cloud
 avdg: why gpu?
 thethiny: since GPU will give u &lt;1 ms
 avdg: you mostly would spend time sending and receiving data
 njaber: Mathematica API ftw
 thethiny: @njaber That's a good idea since their server PCs are faster
 avdg: gpu is only good when there is no need to transfer a lot of information
 thethiny: how come
 avdg: (between gpu and cpu)
 thethiny: you're only sending limited data
 thethiny: you use the GPU to train the model
 thethiny: then you get the AI fast
 thethiny: and since you trained it on GPU
 thethiny: you infer it on GPU
 njaber: I'll test that if I need to train an AI at some point, for now I'm still working on a pseudo-predict
 thethiny: easier than creating a CPU model
 avdg: hmm, but a script can load everything needed at the first turn
 avdg: I wonder if these servers even have gpu
 rcar: of course they don't have gpus
 thethiny: I'm talking about custom servers, not theirs
 njaber: They are made specifically to run trained IA
 njaber: Oh the CG ones
 njaber: The Mathematica ones msot likely have
 avdg: not sure if the gpu in the cpu is actually enough
 avdg: if there is one
 Kellthazar: Imagine a NN with 30 inputs, 2 hidden layers with 16 inputs and 3 outputs (move, direction, type). I think is doable.
 Durkin: geeze xD just slapped in tracking where I knew there wasn't dots for when sight comes back empty and the bugger went from 700 to 350
 NapTown: yup
 thethiny: To show you how overcomplicated my arena code is
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460064098">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460064098</a>
 thethiny: Red is No Speed, No Future Sightings, No Attack no Switch
 thethiny: Blue is my arena code
 BenjaminUrquhart: the non-arena won though
 NapTown: what do you mean by no future sightings?
 thethiny: @Ben Exactly, my arena is overcomplicated
 thethiny: @NapTown I don't predict what's gonna happen and I don't calculate the points in advance
 NapTown: and how often does your simple bot win?
 thethiny: against my arena? Everytime
 NapTown: ouch :D
 thethiny: exactly
 thethiny: and if you see, my pacs stopped moving
 thethiny: and I still won
 NapTown: surely it doesn't win every time that way, plus it got good rng with the battles
 thethiny: okay my Arena won cuz it ate both enemy pacs
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460066699">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460066699</a> #thethiny 
 thethiny: what's the AI you used for this battle?
 Kellthazar: Not that fancy, some rule decisions based on what is visible to my pacs.
 thethiny: okay
 thethiny: so I guess my battles against myself were just unlucky then
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460068197">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460068197</a>
 Kellthazar: This was a close one.
 thethiny: that's the thing
 thethiny: my Arena AI shouldn't _struggle_ against simple AIs
 thethiny: I overcomplicated it to the point where it just doesn't eat anymore
 solaimanope: are asserts enabled for java?
 thethiny: no idea
 thethiny: you should try
 thethiny: assert(0/0)
 thethiny: or try catch
 dbdr: assert(false)
 thethiny: Guys from Bitwise operations can you remind me with 2 gate minimzation?
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e088c04a-2644-4605-8994-1157c6a6e441">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e088c04a-2644-4605-8994-1157c6a6e441</a>
 Kellthazar: I think that your bot backs to an explored floor sometimes, don't know if because of the pathfind. #thethiny
 thethiny: It doesn't have proper assumptions that's why
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethiny what do you need help with for the bitwise stuff?
 thethiny: I remember back in the days of Kmap we used to reduce 4 variables into a 2-Gate solution
 thethiny: I have 4 variables that I only want specific triggers
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7bbd1549-fc53-4cb5-b993-3b4e00c4119d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7bbd1549-fc53-4cb5-b993-3b4e00c4119d</a>
 thethiny: I want to reduce this into a bitwise operation for 4 bits
 BenjaminUrquhart: so basically you only want 1 bit to be set?
 thethiny: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: is this 4 different variables or 1 variable with 4 bits?
 thethiny: 4 different bools
 thethiny: Left Right Up Down
 BenjaminUrquhart: python?
 thethiny: yeah
 BenjaminUrquhart: I mean, you can just sum them and see if it equals 1
 BenjaminUrquhart: but if you're set on bitwise
 thethiny: yeah I know, but I wanna remember how we used to do it using NAND gates
 BenjaminUrquhart: let me think
 thethiny: I remmeber using K-Maps but I totally forgot how
 thethiny: been out of college for years now 😭
 struct: What are you trying to do?
 thethiny: make a  bitwise operation that is True in specific cases
 BenjaminUrquhart: basically, only 1 bit out of 4 is set
 thethiny: yes
 struct: all stored in same var?
 thethiny: 4 vars
 struct: var can only be 1 and 0?
 thethiny: boolean, yes
 thethiny: I think this is the smallets NAND you can go with
 thethiny: !A and !B and !C and D or!A and !B and C and !D or!A and B and !C and !D orA and !B and !C and !D
 thethiny: yeah just checked here
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.32x8.com/index.html">http://www.32x8.com/index.html</a>
 thethiny: that's the smallest we can go
 Kellthazar: Yey... for now, first place on my country. XD
 thethiny: well done :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: 6th for mine :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: I got a ding
 thethiny: waddyamean

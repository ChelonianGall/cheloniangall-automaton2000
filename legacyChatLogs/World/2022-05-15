 BenjaminUrquhart: Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: but i still have a bug
 eulerscheZahl: thanks ClockSort (didn't see it yesterday). in round 3 my journey will surely end, but the tshirt is nice
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but how would you do it?
 Drmewzih: i hate short mode
 jacek: use python/ruby [solved]
 Drmewzih: how the output can be 0
 jacek: print(0)
 putibuzu: jacek has all the answers :D 
 Drmewzih: LOL
 Cumpanasii: Hi! If anyone here solved the nuggets numbers problem, can you please tell me validator 6 numbers? I can't get past it
 5DN1L: Even if one has solved the problem it doesn't mean one has access to the validators.
 wlesavo: euler is it your first round 3?
 eulerscheZahl: yes and no. i qualified before but had no time on that specific date to participate
 Cumpanasii: it seems that 2 guys in the discussion page posted other 2 validators data, I figured that it would be possible. But thank you for your answer.
 5DN1L: I have access to the validators
 5DN1L: The 5 numbrs in Validator 6 are all less than 20
 5DN1L: numbers*
 Cumpanasii: oh well, thanks for that
 5DN1L: 2 are less than 10, 3 are more than 10
 5DN1L: try some random numbers to test your code
 Cumpanasii: Alright, thank you!
 5DN1L: np
 wlesavo: euler grats
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. i had a hard time yesterday. took me 30min to convince myself that i should start coding
 eulerscheZahl: hay fever and boring/tedious tasks
 Mortis_666: is it normal that i have access to the best solutions of the event puzzles that i didnt solve?
 wlesavo: and im storming codebusters legend, around 600 LoC ago it seemed to be quite close, and now it is still really close :smiley:
 5DN1L: I think it's been the case since the first of such events, Mortis_666
 Mortis_666: oh ok
 Manchi_o6o7: Has someone a tip how to transform a regex into subexpressions, so I can form an NFA&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i was spamming submits for codebusters until i promoted. once i was 0.01 behind the boss but didn't have the patience to wait for someone else pushing me on a mostly inactive game
 wlesavo: even without ejects i was in around top 5, but since then most improovements dont gave much, and i also had quite bad wr against boss
 wlesavo: i even sometimes get above the boss on submit, but still
 struct: did royale already have a NN for onitama?
 _Royale: struct: yes&#160;:)
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 wlesavo: yaaay finaly got this codebusters legend, it took quite longer than it should have
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :muscle::metal:
 eulerscheZahl: it took so long, the game even changed its name
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 wlesavo: my old python submits actualy were at the times when the game had different name, so that basically true :slight_smile:
 Darleanow: Hello every1
 Napstablook_: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: im sure it will be different
 Washier: evening peeps
 Washier: I like C#. I know it is not C
 Washier: Any tips making my C# faster? Mr EulersxheZahl?
 jacek: get faster computer
 Washier: hehe
 Washier: Mr jacek, even you have to admit it is not all about language choice? Or is it. How deep do you search on Checkers for example?
 jacek: well c/c++ can be few times faster than java. dunno how c# can be optimized
 jacek: and my checkers bot is mcts-like, depth is irrelevant
 jacek: depth around 11-12 of most visited move. but its different from alpha-beta
 jacek: hmm you can use intrinistrics in c#
 Washier: thanks. i search 6 deep in my C# checkers bot. Mr Frog does so well in board games, curious if it is lang tricks or better search. obsessed with board games again
 jacek: bitboards?
 Washier: i do
 jacek: material eval only?
 Washier: try my utmost to make game engine fast
 Washier: no, in checkers a bit more complicated eval, but obviously not good enough, or searching too shallow
 Washier: same thing in othello. guess it is just talent
 jacek: even the same rank ;o
 Washier: hehe
 Washier: bandas and breakthrough also fun. yavalath next. 
 eulerscheZahl: checkers: in early game I get depth 8 for my alpha-beta (about 60-70k nodes visited)
 eulerscheZahl: pretty standard implementation i would say. no bitboards or other fancy tricks, going the OOP route
 eulerscheZahl: zobrist hashing for duplicate states
 eulerscheZahl: even ignoring hash collisions entirely
 Washier: thanks.
 Washier: zobrist is a good next step for me. sehr gut
 MSmits: yavalath is pretty hard to sim
 Washier: i 
 MSmits: minimax works well though
 MSmits: mcts only after a lot of modification
 Washier: thanks
 Washier: MSmits is the yavalath expert everyone.
 MSmits: the problem with yavalath is mostly the insane amount of branching early game
 MSmits: yeah I spent too much time thinking about this game :P
 jacek: thats what you have opening books for
 MSmits: yeah, this helps a lot, but most of your opponents don't use them, or a very small one Washier
 Washier: I have seen that yes. I branch very coservatively.
 jacek: prune array eh
 Washier: interesting. 
 MSmits: as for language choice, the simpler the game is, the more important performance becomes
 MSmits: it's only the simplest boardgames where it is the deciding factor I think
 Washier: i worked hard on an book for othello, didn't help much, but that might just be me
 MSmits: I got 1st with a book. Counterbooked 10 players, won every game
 MSmits: in othello
 Washier: wow
 jacek: and made recurse rage quit
 Washier: hehe
 MSmits: I took it off
 eulerscheZahl: i got first at code keeper with a book
 MSmits: I did not mean to ruin people's game. He had just trained a neural network that beat everyone and I counterbooked it in half a day
 Washier: it seems having a book is one thing, having a good book is another. my books suck
 jacek: and now nyannyan owned everyone
 MSmits: with a book also?&gt;
 struct: I was also first on c4 with a book a long time ago
 struct: this was my book
 struct: 1 &lt;&lt; 9;
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: yes. his twitter was/is filled with rubik cubes and othello's algorithms
 Washier: &lt;bow&gt; struct
 MSmits: ahh I might go back to othello some day. too busy with oware now
 MSmits: 37 seed book almost done, fingers crossed for it not having errors
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Nyanyan/Egaroucid5">https://github.com/Nyanyan/Egaroucid5</a>
 MSmits: minimax bot?
 Washier: I just love getting the board game guys talking. I am not that good but find board games extremely interesting. wish i could operate on this level
 MSmits: We're all good at different things though
 MSmits: I can't do NN very well, haven't made a serious NN for one of these codingame arenas yet
 jacek: probably n-tuples and mpc
 MSmits: but I've gotten good at solving games and endgame books
 struct: Im good at wasting time shaving nanoseconds
 struct: saving*?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm good at idling on chat
 MSmits: yeah i can also do a performant bot, though struct is better at this
 MSmits: he can use AVX better
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl can basically do everything, though he does not specialize. He can make a bot for any game in a few hrs
 jacek: i stopped caring about sim speed that much since NN takes over 90% time. though in onitama its still relatively small so i could use faster sim
 Washier: &lt;beaming&gt;
 MSmits: yeah i stopped caring about it mostly as well. But I have kept the habits from when I did, so most of them time the bots are fairly optimized
 struct: I should stop caring too 
 struct: since my bots with 10% of the speed perform nearly the same
 MSmits: if it's no longer fun for you. That's the most important part
 Washier: I also really love evlutionary algo's. have had some success with the. anyone ever use them?
 Washier: struct. you are a hero
 MSmits: many used them here. I didn't. I tried SA though, it's simpler
 MSmits: GA has more params
 Washier: have used SA before too. also lovely
 MSmits: yeah I like it
 jacek: GA on search race :heart:
 Washier: isn't gow you formulate(frame) the GA also very important?
 struct: I dont know GA
 Washier: you can do it struct
 MSmits: Washier you mean what you consider a solution and how you mutate it, what you cross etc?
 Washier: yes
 MSmits: SA has the same issue in deciding what to random
 MSmits: only less choices to make
 Washier: true
 jacek: GA in action <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/a52fbn">https://streamable.com/a52fbn</a>
 MSmits: looks cool
 MSmits: are these visualizations easy to make?
 jacek: its qt. i just used paintEvent loop and draw rects, circles and lines
 MSmits: qt?
 MSmits: quicktime?
 j4at: google it lmao
 MSmits: googling 2 characters is not advisable&#160;:)
 jacek: c++ gui framework
 j4at: its crasosplatform
 jacek: lul, youll be surprised
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: ohh it finds it on google with just qt
 MSmits: :surprised:
 jacek: similarly how in java i used swing's paintComponent for this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/qgza5b">https://streamable.com/qgza5b</a>
 MSmits: br2k?
 Wontonimo: antiwonto needed a reboot.  it's back
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: :taco:
 Washier: can vouch for qt
 antiwonto: [auto] ':taco:' was defined as ' A currency to some, sustenance for others '
 jacek: :taco: MSmits
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded MSmits 4 tacos. MSmits now has 7 taco. jacek now has 18 taco
 MSmits: wow 7 already

 MSmits: thats my endgame book 37 seeds progress
 MSmits: ever 2 hrs 10-20 mins it outputs a new iteration. When 0 are different book is done
 MSmits: not sure how long left. Maybe 30 or so
 MSmits: so... half a week
 MSmits: then 38 seeds&#160;::P
 MSmits: I am stopping there. Need a whole different method, as 39 is around 35 GB.
 Washier: what is that please?
 struct: MSmits on smitsimax for csb do the trees share the same eval?
 MSmits: endgame book for oware. 37 seeds means 37 seeds left on the board. I calculate the net game result when played from each positition
 MSmits: there are 22 billion different boards with 37 seeds on them
 MSmits: stored at 7 bits per board, so 19 GB
 Washier: thanks
 MSmits: The same score is backpropagated for each tree, so in that sense they share, but the blocker contributes differently to the eval than the runner
 MSmits: the reason i backpropagate the same score is that if the runner does something good, that may be because of something the blocker did
 struct: I see
 struct: thanks
 Washier: hehe
 struct: I might try checkers
 struct: It seems its easy enough to make a sim
 Washier: doo eet
 jacek: is it though, with loop jumping
 Washier: yes, that is the tough bit
 jacek: you may want to read on cake development <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php">http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php</a> he finally used some n-tuples into his engine
 struct: The board fits in 32 bits right?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: 4* 32 bit
 jacek: 3
 jacek: black, white and kings
 Washier: yes
 MSmits: oh, I always used 4, did not occur to me to do it that way
 Washier: you need 2 x 32-bit boards
 Washier: 3 really to mark kings
 MSmits: yeah, I'll remember that for when i revisit
 Washier: &lt;bow&gt;
 jacek: well i use 3x64bits. actually nothing fancy in my bitboard, except it isnt 2d array
 MSmits: I used so much fancy that I dont know how it works anymore. Did not help me much though
 Washier: same. 3 uint32's
 MSmits: my sim has lots of intrinsic stuff, pdep and pext and all that
 MSmits: eval matters a lot more here
 Washier: eval speed or eval quality?
 MSmits: quality
 MSmits: I just counted kings and men mostly
 Washier: mmm
 MSmits: Also, I used mcts with ept, maybe a plain minimax would be better.
 struct: feels similar to bt
 Washier:  i used plain minimax. 
 struct: but on bt its easy to check if a player won
 jacek: and before that
 Washier: quite similar to bt for me, use same bitboard construct
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl with the hungarian method, can you square a matrix with both lack of agents and lack of goals?  What I mean is, can you add rows to make it square, but also add columns to make it square?
 Washier: that is some high level maths i used to know
 jacek: hexagonal matrix :drooling_face:
 Washier: likr yavalath
 MSmits: yavalath is high level math?
 MSmits: oh hex
 struct: jacek in which games have you implemented ntupples?
 jacek: othello and yavalath
 MSmits: it being hex gives it 12 symmetries, as opposed to 8 with a square game
 jacek: and c4 at first, but now its nn
 MSmits: nine mens morris has even more symmetry. 16 if i remember correctly
 Washier: i'm the idtiota in this coversation, but yavalath works pretty well with the board representations discussed so far. its just funny
 MSmits: whats funny?
 Washier: hexagonal 
 Washier: not funny, diffreent
 MSmits: yeah I don't know how to work it efficiently really. I just do pext stuff to extract winning hexes and such
 Washier: your brain works differently Mr Smith. 
 Washier: very interesting
 Washier: *Mr Smits
 eulerscheZahl: yes MSmits you can also add columns
 Washier: &lt;eyeball&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: if it's in the context of PR2: add cells multiple times as a target but with decreasing score for having more units
 MSmits: yeah my brain is weird
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl should you explore with multiple pods then?
 MSmits: i was just thinking of sending a 1 pod to explore
 MSmits: per target
 eulerscheZahl: what's a target? direct neighbors only or a few steps ahead?
 eulerscheZahl: but multiple units can still be beneficial for fighting
 MSmits: yeah i am not sure yet, for now i will just consider anythign a target but those further away from base are worth less
 MSmits: yeah but if you have multiple units left over, you can also  send them toward opponent base
 eulerscheZahl: not going to argue about that now, i feel sick
 eulerscheZahl: codejam was a torture yesterday
 MSmits: I am not arguing. No idea how to play this game yet. Just trying stuff
 Drmewzih: go take a nap&#160;:)
 MSmits: ahh sick from codign?
 Washier: drink tea. dress warm for bed
 eulerscheZahl: headache
 Washier: sinus?
 JonathanCarnos: sciatic
 Washier: good night
 jacek: cosinus
 MSmits: yay working bot in pr2. I was worried the hungarian method would be too slow. But no timeouts.
 MSmits: oh nvm spoke too soon, just spotted one =)
 MSmits: 106 by 106 matrix probably not a good idea
 struct: MSmits are you using bitboards on it?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey struct, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 25 tacos
 MSmits: no struct
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: I am also just using C#. Not really concerned with performance
 Astrobytes: are you 1st yet?
 MSmits: I am 792th
 Astrobytes: almost!
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: I have a lot left to do
 Astrobytes: hi Washier! :wave:
 MSmits: the hungarian method works, but scoring function is crap
 MSmits: i need defense vs rushes
 Astrobytes: ah right, yeah the rushes
 Astrobytes: there are ways of countering it but I don't remember much tbh
 Astrobytes: I figured I would do codebusters since I'm fresh from that last contest and it's similar
 MSmits: better algo for guessing where the opponent could have sent his bots. I am just using floodfill now, but if you record the entire vision history, you can at turn 100 confirm that between 50 and 100, no opponent bot has visited a certain hex, which means you should not floodfill there
 MSmits: once they visit, the owner changes
 struct: whats this hungarian method?
 Astrobytes: Kuhn-Munkres
 MSmits: how to assign X agents to Y tasks
 MSmits: using a cost for each combination of X and Y
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/hungarian-matching/#:~:text=The%20Hungarian%20matching%20algorithm%2C%20also,sometimes%20called%20the%20assignment%20problem">https://brilliant.org/wiki/hungarian-matching/#:~:text=The%20Hungarian%20matching%20algorithm%2C%20also,sometimes%20called%20the%20assignment%20problem</a>.
 MSmits: never done codebusters
 Astrobytes: it's not my favourite game, put it that way
 struct: me neither
 struct: and I never will
 Astrobytes: but it's very similar to last contest
 MSmits: did you not like last contest either?
 struct: maybe you can reverse the seed there?
 struct: no I did not
 Astrobytes: neither did I
 Astrobytes: I forced myself to play it
 Astrobytes: since they don't come along so often
 struct: yeah only reason
 struct: ifs and fog are not for me
 struct: also infinite search space im not good at that
 MSmits: ah, I like fog when it's on a discrete playing field
 MSmits: like in oceans. And I like it in pr2 also
 MSmits: but yeah i dont like it in infinite seach space
 Astrobytes: yeah it's OK in discrete spaces
 Astrobytes: OOC was fog done right
 MSmits: the whole game was about the fog
 MSmits: pacman also had fog like this. I did not mind it there either, but the game was hard to play anyways
 Astrobytes: didn't like that 
 MSmits: when you have fog, it has to be an important feature. If it is a nuisance, then it's better not to have it
 struct: Did this game even need fog?
 struct: maybe it needed, who knows
 MSmits: you mean the contest?
 Astrobytes: what , the spider game?
 MSmits: I don't think it needed fog
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: No it didn't
 Astrobytes: usual CG attempt to make it heuristic-based
 Wontonimo: The fog sure makes it easier for newer contestants to climb the leaderboard and limit old-timers who have a whole harness made from just destroying everyone quickly  (i think, if I'm being generous)
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's what I was getting at with my last comment
 MSmits: I had to read that 3 times Wontonimo
 MSmits: I thought, why would they make a harness from the corpses of other contestants?
 Astrobytes: You have a distracted mind MSmits
 Astrobytes: + disturbed, evidently :P
 MSmits: maybe yeah
 Astrobytes: ohhh btw MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdqcUTNHwyo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdqcUTNHwyo</a>
 Astrobytes: Stephen Colbert plays DnD
 Astrobytes: (it's awesome)
 MSmits: holy sht
 MSmits: thank you!
 Astrobytes: courtesy of Scarfield. The whole channel is amazing btw, long videos though but amazing
 MSmits: nice find
 Astrobytes: yeah for sure, I feel my dnd urges coming back :D
 Wontonimo: why did they go away?
 Astrobytes: time, lack of other interested people to motivate me, life, etc
 MSmits: I still play dnd, 2 times a year or so. By the time we finish a campaign, there's a whole new version of dnd out there
 MSmits: same guys that I played with 20+ yrs ago basically
 MSmits: except back then we did it every 2 weeks
 Astrobytes: you can do it in person now at least
 MSmits: yeah i did a month or two ago
 Astrobytes: awesome
 Astrobytes: remote is OK but so much better when you're all physically there
 MSmits: was fun, though I would not mind just playing other types of games that don't require this much preparation
 Astrobytes: my mate is really into Vulcania, sent me the manual and everything but I'm lacking motivation recently
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geargames.eu/">https://www.geargames.eu/</a>
 Astrobytes: ^ from there
 MSmits: looks fun, yeah thats the sort of game i meant
 MSmits: I liked the Munchkin board game
 Astrobytes: he got free stuff from them for something, I can't remember why
 MSmits: ah nice
 Astrobytes: the Plague Inc. board games are good fun
 Astrobytes: hey Vulcania can get very deep
 Astrobytes: Character creation is almost it's own manual
 MSmits: Yeah, I like it to be a bit simpler if I am only going to play twice a year
 0xhotdawg: hi
 0xhotdawg: anyone tried socket programming with c?
 MSmits: I don't even know what socket programming is
 0xhotdawg: network programming
 MAWAAW: ye long time ago when was student
 MSmits: ah, well I haven't
 MAWAAW: TCP / UDP :D
 jacek: good thing with UDP jokes is that i dont care if you get them or not
 0xhotdawg: im interested in learning socket programming, which language u think is best for that? or hsould i just start with c for example?
 jacek: socket sounds low level, but id start with python
 struct: everything starts with python
 0xhotdawg: oh interesting
 0xhotdawg: u were able to do like a server app with python?
 0xhotdawg: sc*
 struct: I dont understand how people learned how to code before python was created
 Astrobytes: MSmits: there's always Hero Quest!
 Westicles: search for traps!
 MSmits: whats that again?
 jacek: umm
 MAWAAW: ((x^2)+(9*(x+y))) derivative x give 2x + 9y + 9 right&#160;?
 MAWAAW: to be sure
 MSmits: yeah
 MAWAAW: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/derivative-time---part1">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/derivative-time---part1</a>
 MAWAAW: then the test case 4 is wrong
 MSmits: i did not try that puzzle. 
 jacek: i feel so indifferent
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MAWAAW: lul UDP on you
 Westicles: MAWAAW nope
 MSmits: whats the forumula to calculate the derivative of MAWAAW?
 MSmits: for testcase 4
 MAWAAW: ((x^2)+(9*(x+y)))
 MSmits: what do you think the answer should be?
 Westicles: 2x+9
 MSmits: you have to evaluate it MAWAAW
 MAWAAW: 2x + 9y + 9 cuz derivate x not y
 MSmits: the output is an integer
 MSmits: not a formula
 MSmits: apparently the answer is 11 for that testcase
 MSmits: I am guessing x = 1 and y = 0
 MSmits: and you get this input
 MSmits: which means 2 * 1 + 9 * 0 + 9 = 11
 MAWAAW: no actually it's x 1 y 2
 MAWAAW: result 29
 MSmits: let me check
 TINOUAINANI: clash empty
 Astrobytes: If you join it they will come.
 Astrobytes: (party time, excellent)
 MSmits: MAWAAW i cant see what you are doing wrong, still looking
 MSmits: Perhaps the testcase is indeed wrong and the validators aren't. Then you can still solve it
 0xhotdawg: anyone of u guys doing ctfs?
 Astrobytes: a few people on here do
 0xhotdawg: im actually a beginner and i wanna join an active team 
 Astrobytes: discord might be the best place to get people who are into it tbh
 0xhotdawg: yeah true
 0xhotdawg: i know afew ppl that r doing it but you know, they either not active or actually too good to accept me
 Astrobytes: yeah, best to ask for others near your level
 Astrobytes: or if you're good in one particular aspect, then ask for people who need someone in that role (reversing, crypto, cracking, whatever)
 MAWAAW: ye it's wrong seems like it's a new puzzle
 Westicles: nobody knows how partial derivates work apparently...
 MAWAAW: what do you mean
 MAWAAW: it's a x derivative not x and y derivate
 Westicles: d/dx(9y)=0
 Astrobytes: Is this an old puzzle or it was just in approval state for a very, very long time? It looks familiar
 MSmits: ah yes sorry i missed that MAWAAW, Westicles is right
 MSmits: I read it as x*y for some reason
 Astrobytes: the puzzle seems fine from looking at it
 MSmits: derivative is 2x + 9
 MAWAAW: oh ya I got it my bad
 MSmits: 2*1 + 9 = 11
 MAWAAW: it's like a constant -_-
 MSmits: indeed
 Astrobytes: Kinda clear from the statement&#160;;)
 Dono1: Hi everyone. I'm somewhat of a JS beginner and looking for help debugging my Ghost Legs (easy) program. It passes all but the last test case.
 Dono1: Not looking to rewrite the whole thing but if someone could help me figure out where it goes wrong on the last test case, that would be really helpful.
 jacek: ask away
 Dono1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/pqxlO6">https://codeshare.io/pqxlO6</a>
 Dono1: codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ghost-legs
 Wontonimo: what is the purpose of line 89?
 Wontonimo: seems sus
 Dono1: Without that, it didn't like the final newline character.
 j4at: Well that's a definitely long answer for an easy puzzle
 Dono1: Lol, I know I'm a beginner. Just learning here!
 Wontonimo: do you know about the join feature?
 Dono1: I do not.
 Dono1: Reading about it now
 Wontonimo: ["hi","there"].join("_")'hi_there'
 Wontonimo: yeah, it won't fix your problem but it will be way cleaner
 Dono1: But I'm more concerned about the actual jsonResultObject getting screwed up somewhere along the way, only on the last test case.
 Dono1: Agreed
 Wontonimo: what are you trying to do here 
 Dono1: I was trying to make the resultObject into a displayable data type.
 Wontonimo: looks like it is just for debugging
 Dono1: for the purpose of logging with console.error
 j4at: lol
 Wontonimo: you can just do this
 j4at: yep he is using it for logging
 j4at: you don't  need a string
 Wontonimo: or all in one line with your prefix message
 Wontonimo: again, not going to solve your problem, but you came looking for feedback
 Dono1: Well, you're clearly right about the console.error(resultObject), but I could have sworn I tried that and after it didn't work, I went to the string...I must have done something else.
 Dono1: Yeah, I agree about the one line thing. It was just an effort to be incredibly simple with short lines. Not ideal I'm sure.
 j4at: I think I know i found the problem
 jacek: its the javascript, isnt it
 Wontonimo: yes, js
 j4at: Dicts are not ordered in js right&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that's right
 Wontonimo: use lists for order
 j4at: Well the problem that he stored the resut in a dict 
 j4at: then printed them unordered
 Dono1: Just so I understand, does that explain why it works in all but the last test case?
 j4at: yes
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Wontonimo: i love js for small bits of code.  not so much when there are 100,000 lines of code
 Dono1: I don't understand. Could you explain a bit what's unique about the last test case that would cause a dictionary to utterly fail like mine did?
 j4at: Well, dicts outputs keys ordered (sometimes it doesn't)
 j4at: And the first cases keys are ordered
 j4at: and last case they are not
 Dono1: Ah, well thank you. That helps a lot.
 Ayza: I am assuming because the other testcases were alphabetically and numerically ordered?
 Ayza: while the last one was kinda random
 Dono1: Yeah, for sure. I just thought they were being added in the order I was adding them, but now I see that was a coincidence.
 Dono1: So, is it a better approach then to use a Map instead of a Dictionary?

 Lyknart: i search ruby dev, for a syntax question 
 Dono1: I didn't realize my post above would paste as a code link. ^, lol. Just trying to convert a map to a simple array.
 Dono1: map to a string (typo)
 Dynamolten.: hello lucazade
 trulynameless.: dono1 use a python dictionary <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp</a>

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Dono1, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 2 tacos
 trulynameless.: umm ill see
 Astrobytes: Dono1: No, don't ask for things like that. You have an example, now find a way to do that in the language you are using.
 Dono1: I'm not looking for a free lunch here, but I've been stuck trying array.join() and the best I can get is: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5d9fdab-078b-4b22-8595-e8b0c982af96">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5d9fdab-078b-4b22-8595-e8b0c982af96</a>
 Dono1: Agh, another link! 
 Dono1: TL:DR, the result always has a comma between key and value it seems.
 Wontonimo: what's the code that is generating this?
 Wontonimo: oh, i see, you don't have code to do it.  it's just a question

 Dono1: On Ghost Legs (easy)
 Dono1: I produce a Map, that I attempt to turn into an array and then into a string in the format that assignment wants, but I am currently working on getting rid of the commas.
 Wontonimo: look at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/E613Bsg">https://tech.io/snippet/E613Bsg</a>
 Wontonimo: it may help
 Dono1: It might help...not sure though. I previously was using an object instead of a map, but on Test case 06 of this level, the object kept becoming unordered, and it was recommended to me to use a Map so that it remembers the insertion order.
 Wontonimo: and here is some more <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/IwVqyf8">https://tech.io/snippet/IwVqyf8</a>
 Wontonimo: gotta go.  have fun

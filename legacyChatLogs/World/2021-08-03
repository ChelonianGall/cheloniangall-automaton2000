 xxd: I wonder what types of strategies reCurse uses to get 1st place in bot programming challenges
 xxd: like how sophisticated can one get? neural networks / GA? or is there more

 Dohmanlechx: How can I convert a char in C++ to binary? Trying to solve that Chuck Norris puzzle.
 Dohmanlechx: i.e. 'C' = 1000011
 KiwiTae: bitset&lt;8&gt;('C')
 Olitoni: i actually tried to do the churck norris puzzle
 Olitoni: But for some reason in the last thest one of the chars is weird in javascript
 Olitoni: and it's wrong by one
 Olitoni: and like it's impossible to debug
 KiwiTae: i think bout 100k people solved it its possible hehe
 Olitoni: but why is a random character different?
 Olitoni: in the middle of the string?
 Olitoni: 1 bit is wrong
 Olitoni: im using the javascript ascii table
 dbdr: debug it. print the steps on the console
 KiwiTae: ^
 Olitoni: yeah i'm doing that
 Olitoni: when i put it into a binary to text converter it is correct
 Olitoni: but when converted to unary 1 bit is wrong
 Dohmanlechx: Thanks KiwiTae, bitset&lt;8&gt; binaryOf(c); worked fine. Next step is to find a way to iterate through it. I'm forcing me to practice on C++, I usually code in Kotlin and Dart otherwise&#160;:)
 Maxim251: Oh my god, I did achive tree search in Ultimate tictactoe, but timming is to low, and I cand do it everytime that search, then I get another problem, I try use only one leg to check if this is win, and my code sometimes get brake, I have there such a mes, because I was trying doing everything... and I feel that I dont have energy to trying more...
 Maxim251: This is that foulty code
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/12a32e1b-b336-4a03-bcf6-94584fe9cd1c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/12a32e1b-b336-4a03-bcf6-94584fe9cd1c</a>
 Maxim251: I think half of that code should be erased..&#160;:/
 Dohmanlechx: (note: had to change to 7 bit for the puzzle, i.e. bitset&lt;7&gt; binaryOf(c);)
 derjack: whats your rank on UTTT
 Maxim251: With normal logic, I could get working, but not everytime I will win, with tree search I can predict the best moves, but thats my problem, I dont know how correctly write it :P
 Maxim251: I dont go to the rank... With that code, I don't have nothing to look there
 Maxim251: struct map is a helper class, I feel that writtening code should be simpler....
 Maxim251: Tree class is that main one, where supose should do tree search, but I had problems to corectly move back in that tree and chose next move to check if is win, and then move back to beginning to output that move. When on base map there are moves, I should memorise all moves from that game, and then do search tree to output the last moves. There are the most problems what I have, I cant go out more then 3 moves.
 Maxim251: and my head is hurting me :P
 derjack: why memorize all moves from entire tree?
 Maxim251: This line "makeMove(_root.nodes.back(), _root.nodes.back().curentPlayer, another )&#160;; " is duing next level .. like next move, and going back from that function is muving back from that tree
 Maxim251: that line after while loop " _root.points += newNode.points; " is transfering back points which means that how many wins was in that tree
 Maxim251: No no, When program is going back from tree, is forgetting that moves, and only what I left is transferred points. What I mean is actual game, that actual moves should be recorded, to check another sort of moves
 Maxim251: My problem lies, that I cant record moves when on board is made 3 or more moves. 
 Maxim251: 102000021
 Maxim251: game dont outputs board, only is outputing avaible moves... But on each step i should memorize moves step by step... Because game will not output me moves from the past.
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tic-tac-toe">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tic-tac-toe</a>
 Maxim251: this is link to game
 Maxim251: I start with simple 1 board, because tree search is for me something new, and I want learn and practice that. thats why also I did stay in wood league.
 derjack: are you trying minimax or mcts
 Maxim251: no, minimax is for search values in existing tree, I am earising tree because what I need is maximum points from move at the beggining
 Maxim251: to know what next move to do.
 Maxim251: But I was also concidering that.
 Maxim251: But transfering points from end of tree to the beggining, alows me to know what first move should be dthe best
 Maxim251: Yeah... I am thinking if is not better to sustain all tree in memory and use minimax insteed to check what next move should be made... Problem is that to make that tree is time consuming, and game have for first move only 1 sec.
 Maxim251: Hmmm...
 Maxim251: This is code what tree search was working, but without outputing move.

 TobiasA: :joy:
 Wontonimo: good morning [system command: adjust to local timezone]
 TobiasA: a good morning to you too
 Wontonimo: how's it going TobiasA&#160;?
 TobiasA: I'm doing just fine hbu?
 Wontonimo: yeah, good
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes or derjack, either of you have any tricks for handling "ties" well in a mcts game?
 Yasser: how to get buddy examiner badge?
 Wontonimo: what's that?
 RoboStac: after you complete a puzzle you on the results tab you can click to view other solutions and it lets you choose your favourite. Do that a few times and you get the badge
 RoboStac: assuming you mean budding examiner
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: i forgot about that
 Wontonimo: hey Robo, do you handle ties in mcts in some special way like win/lose solver&#160;?
 RoboStac: yeah, though I'm still not sure on the best way
 RoboStac: usually once a node is a solved draw I just ignore it during selection so it will send all the exploration to the moves that look worse to ensure there isn't a way to win. During backprop this lowers the parents overall scores though
 Yasser: is it by upvoting RoboStac?
 RoboStac: you can sort of work round this during backprop by checking if any of a nodes siblings are solved draws and backpropping a draw instead at that point but it's a bit slower
 RoboStac: Yasser - no, you get two options and have to choose your favourite. It's separate to the old upvoting system
 Yasser: Ah I see it's not possible to do on previous solved puzzles? 
 RoboStac: it is, you can just go back and open the results tab
 RoboStac: you have to do it in the ide though
 Yasser: Got it, thank you!
 Yasser: mouse hovering in the chat on profiles doesn't work anymore?&#160;:/ 
 RoboStac: nope, it's been reported as a bug on discord but no staff responses yet
 Yasser: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Yasser: :sweat_smile:
 Wontonimo: Thanks RoboStac.  totally makes sense
 Wontonimo: the part about ignoring solves during selection is interesting.  I haven't implemented that.
 RoboStac: without that it just selects the draw over and over and you just waste a lot of processing time not learning anything new
 Dohmanlechx: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e15a0a78-d697-448a-8d0a-59a3cadf9988">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e15a0a78-d697-448a-8d0a-59a3cadf9988</a>
 Dohmanlechx: It should be 1,0,0,0,0,1,1
 RoboStac: thats just the standard for indexing bits - bit 0 is the least significant bit
 Dohmanlechx: Yeah just read about it. Gotta loop backward then.
 AllYourTrees: the mcts solver paper talks about over/under estimation when skipping solved nodes, but they don't really do any actual analysis of it or show how much it affects things
 AllYourTrees: skipping solved nodes seemed stronger when i tested it
 Wontonimo: excellent, thanks
 Wontonimo: i'm testing now on C4
 MSmits: AllYourTrees skipping solved nodes is better, but there are ways you can control the bias
 Wontonimo: oh, like what?
 MSmits: say you're backpropagating a loss that was an alternative  of a solved draw
 Wontonimo: ah
 MSmits: while going back up the tree, you check the siblings, if one of them is a solved draw, you change the result to 0
 AllYourTrees: interesting
 MSmits: thats one way to do it, but then you bias on wins
 MSmits: the alternative is to keep backpropagating 0's until the weak nodes value exceeds 0
 AllYourTrees: can you just replace values with the solution (if its better) as you back up?
 MSmits: well thats one way to do it, but not necessarily
 MSmits: what you can also do is for every layer, during backpropagation, check the node you went through, if it's below 0, just backprop 0
 MSmits: but if it's above 0, backprop whatever result you found
 MSmits: because apparently you're working on a better node now
 MSmits: I'll make a picture in a sec, have to let dog out
 Wontonimo: okay, so on C4 it looks like just ignoring solved wins pushed my Trueskill up about 1 point.  Same ranking but a higher TS right off hop
 MSmits: here's how you can deal with solved draw bias in a picture:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/WT2rvDU">https://imgur.com/a/WT2rvDU</a>
 MSmits: so only backpropagate results when it's a good node
 MSmits: but do also backprop losses through that node. when you backprop, you backprop ALL
 MSmits: until it becomes a bad node, then you turn off backpropagation through it, or at least, you backprop 0 to keep increasing visit count
 AllYourTrees: interesting
 AllYourTrees: ty for the pic!
 MSmits: np, btw, i do not generally use this because there's performance overhead
 AntiSquid: trademarked graphics
 MSmits: and solved draw bias is almost non-existant in most games
 MSmits: since draws usually solve last, except in games where early draws are possible
 MSmits: so not in uttt, not in othello, not in C4 etc.
 MSmits: not in yavalath either
 AntiSquid: quite sure there are draw branches early on and through out the game in C4 
 MSmits: branches yes, but not terminal nodes
 MSmits: these draw branches are very hard to solve
 MSmits: so they solve last
 AntiSquid: i mean once you go down that path best result will only be a draw
 Wontonimo: great, thanks MSmits.  nice drawing 
 MSmits: I guess it depends on your exploration parameter too
 MSmits: from watching meta mcts too many times, i noticed draws always solve last in the games I mentioned
 MSmits: unless exploration is low
 MSmits: then you can dive deep into a drawn branch
 AllYourTrees: i guess thats because draws need all children to be draws, whereas a a win requires 1 child to be loss, and a loss requires all children to be wins(which only require 1 child)
 MSmits: thats it exactly
 MSmits: well it's not 100% true due to ab pruning, but mostly true
 AllYourTrees: do you have ab pruning in mcts solver?
 RoboStac: that and many of these games can only draws due to no moves left so they're always the deepest branches
 MSmits: i have an algorithm for ab pruning in mcts solver yes, but i dont often use it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/G7iT54b">https://imgur.com/a/G7iT54b</a>
 MSmits: you never have to visit the pruned child
 MSmits: as the top node is already a certain draw
 MSmits: if the pruned child is a loss, then the top node is a draw, but if ti is a win, then the top node is also a draw
 AllYourTrees: oh cool
 MSmits: the middle unsolved draw never gets solved btw
 MSmits: because you pruned the child
 MSmits: but you can just skip it
 AllYourTrees: yeah
 MSmits: this is messy to code and can give problems when you reuse the mcts tree
 MSmits: because you will get into situations where you're at a node that was never solved because you skipped it
 BlackGriffin03: Can Some one help me , I am finding Silver league in CSB difficult

 FIVE-CYCLE: holy shit,I think i should review my C++ class...
 FIVE-CYCLE: I have forgot everything...
 Dohmanlechx: Someone did the Chuck Norris task recently?
 Dohmanlechx: Aha, the length had to be 7...
 Flaaamort: Yes: "ASCII characters (7-bit)"
 MSmits: if you have problems with chuck norris, it probably has something to do with leading zeroes
 MSmits: ah damn chat scrolling
 Dohmanlechx: Thanks anyway&#160;:) I always have hard times with algorithms concerning binary. It's solved since a little while tho.
 MSmits: hehe ok
 Dohmanlechx: Quick question, can't I delete my own solutions? (When I corrected a minor error and published again...)
 eulerscheZahl: others will only see your latest submitted solution (per language)
 Dohmanlechx: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: there was some visual bug i think. not sure if that got solved
 eulerscheZahl: looked as if your old was still published but it wasn't
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, how do i fix this, if I want to open a file from a C# program:
 MSmits: static string fileName = "resources\OwareSolver.exe";
 MSmits: i wasn't using a folder before
 reCurse: \\
 MSmits: ahh ok, thanks
 reCurse: or @"
 eulerscheZahl: or @"string"
 oxydowe: also @"resource
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: thanks both&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: or with / instead of \
 MSmits: oh that works?
 MSmits: I was wondering
 eulerscheZahl: even works on windows
 MSmits: though it was a linux thingy
 eulerscheZahl: "resources" + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar + "OwareSolver.exe" :upside_down:
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure there is some Path.Join or similar as well
 reCurse: ew
 eulerscheZahl: so many options
 reCurse: Path.Combine at least
 MSmits: you know, 1 good answer would have sufficed :P
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: we still have to golf it and use hex codes
 eulerscheZahl: i guess the / already is the golfed version
 MSmits: now i have to figure out how to keep 36 filestreams open for my endgame books
 MSmits: i know how to do it in c++
 reCurse: The golfed version is to name it a.exe in the same folder
 oxydowe: "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."
 reCurse: No
 eulerscheZahl: do we need the .exe to pkeep it executable?
 reCurse: Um.
 MSmits: yes eulerscheZahl "{
 oxydowe: that's python, i like to apply to other languages as well&#160;:-)
 reCurse: I guess you can CreateProcess without the exe
 reCurse: But that will be the only way
 eulerscheZahl: that's bad golfing
 MSmits: I am doubleclicking it
 MSmits: oh right
 reCurse: I don't think even cmd prompt will execute without
 MSmits: that one i am not
 MSmits: i could probably make it a dll anyways, if i knew how
 eulerscheZahl: do chmod +x and run it with WLS
 reCurse: ren OwareSolver.exe OwareSolver.dll
 MSmits: does that work&#160;?
 reCurse: Technically yes
 MSmits: never used a dll before, i figured the file would be different
 reCurse: It will be mostly useless but it will work
 MSmits: o
 reCurse: They're both images so
 eulerscheZahl: a .jar is a .iso is a .zip
 MSmits: why&#160;?
 reCurse: Because sometimes you care about the format inside and sometimes you care about what is inside
 MSmits: are their formats the same?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: so the extension is just a way to tell the user what kind of content is in there
 reCurse: Mostly
 reCurse: But programs also use it to figure out what to do
 reCurse: So not just user
 reCurse: But that is also why you can have a png renamed as jpg and it still works
 reCurse: Because the program may ignore the extension and just figure it out by itself
 MSmits: I see
 eulerscheZahl: and the file itself (at least some of them) indicate the type in the first few bytes
 eulerscheZahl: like an exe starting with MZ and a zip with PK
 MSmits: MZ?
 eulerscheZahl: and then there is CAFEBABE as the first 4 bytes
 reCurse: Well any image really
 reCurse: dll start with MZ as well
 eulerscheZahl: MZ after the inventor of the exe format
 reCurse: Initials of some guy who did some DOS things
 eulerscheZahl: mike something
 eulerscheZahl: zabowski?
 reCurse: shrug
 reCurse: My bots start with WTF and me going /flip
 eulerscheZahl: Mark Zbikowski
 eulerscheZahl: (looked it up)
 MSmits: you got the owski right
 eulerscheZahl: you better take notes, this will be relevant in your next exam&#160;;)
 MSmits: ok, another question
 MSmits: what is the C# equivalent of:
 MSmits: ifstream infile;			infile.open(cacheString, ifstream::binary);			infile.read((char*)&amp;(captureCache[0]), CAPTURE_CACHE_SIZE * sizeof(int8_t));			infile.close();
 reCurse: Don't forget to make the exam on completely different questions
 reCurse: euler that one is yours I'm lazy now
 MSmits: wait thats wrong, thats reading the whole file, not really what i want
 eulerscheZahl: File.ReadAllText
 MSmits: 	infiles[seedsOnBoard].seekg(bits7 / 8, ios::beg);	infiles[seedsOnBoard].read((char*)&amp;(lookup), 2 * sizeof(uint8_t));
 jacek: :thinking:
 MSmits: this looks up a single result from the endgame db
 reCurse: ReadAllBytes probably
 reCurse: Doesn't seem like text
 MSmits: it's binary
 eulerscheZahl: my bad
 reCurse: Though I doubt that's what he wants
 eulerscheZahl: can't you just tell what you want to do without those C++ hyroglyphs?
 reCurse: hieroglyphs
 MSmits: i just need to read a little piece, 2 byes in some location in the file
 eulerscheZahl: i'm illiterate
 MSmits: i know where it is, the offset
 reCurse: Open a FileStream
 reCurse: Seek to the correct position
 reCurse: And use that converter thing
 reCurse: ugh it's been too long I did c#
 MSmits: thats kind of the same as in C++, what converter thing?
 reCurse: Nooot really
 reCurse: using (var fs = File.Open(...))
 reCurse: fs.Position =
 reCurse: fs.Read the bytes
 reCurse: BitConverter
 reCurse: to convert bytes to type
 reCurse: Fill in the blanks
 MSmits: i can also just us ethe bytes directly right?
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 reCurse: You can also fix the array and use a pointer directly
 reCurse: But I thought you'd want idiomatic c#
 MSmits: meh, i dont mind, anything that works is fine.
 eulerscheZahl: he doesn't even use List&lt;T&gt;he doesn't care about idiomatic
 MSmits: i prefer working with C++ anyways, but i dont want to learn how to do a gui, so i am kinda stuck with this for now
 reCurse: The state of gui sucks hard
 MSmits: windows forms works and i want to spend as little time on stuff like that as i can get away with
 reCurse: But qt might be worth it for you shrug
 MSmits: qt?
 reCurse: qt
 eulerscheZahl: "cute"
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: thanks reCurse
 eulerscheZahl: notepad++ uses qt iirc
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.qt.io/">https://www.qt.io/</a>&#160;?
 reCurse: yes
 reCurse: I have a hard time figuring out if this or doing web through c++ rest is worse
 MSmits: I have no idea, I only ever run massive 1 file programs i c++ for CG
 eulerscheZahl: web has many approaches that i struggle to understand. i mean it works but why would anyone do this
 reCurse: Because resources
 reCurse: Still kind of debating how to do chess vis
 reCurse: Web has tons of chess ui stuff
 reCurse: BUT
 reCurse: It's wewb
 eulerscheZahl: like blazor. using C# instead of JS, great. but keeping the whole client state duplicated on the server?
 MSmits: it's funny to what lengths coders go to avoid js :P
 reCurse: Not even js but web in general
 reCurse: It's a fucking zoo
 MSmits: you make that sounds bad, but zoo's are fun
 reCurse: But then I have a readymade chessboard instead of recoding it in qt
 eulerscheZahl: and every year there's a dozen of new hyped frameworks
 reCurse: sigh
 jacek: qt? that thing made by trolltech company?

 jacek: population 40 genomes, genome 15 actions
 eulerscheZahl: and some static scoring I assume. no dummy movements
 jacek: whats dummy movement
 eulerscheZahl: my beam takes 1 action and then uses -3v until i've passed 4 checkpoints. measure time it takes as score
 eulerscheZahl: then the standard beam thing: remove bad actions, go deeper
 jrke: what depth you can go?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, let me test :D
 jrke: oh
 jrke: you said -3vel till 4 checkpoints right? so with what thrust always 200?
 eulerscheZahl: mostly depth 5, sometimes 6
 eulerscheZahl: width=50
 jrke: ohk
 jrke: thats grt for depth 5-6
 eulerscheZahl: thrust = 200-something
 jrke: mine goes 15-16 depth beam width 900
 eulerscheZahl: that something depends on the angle difference
 jrke: but less choice
 jrke: ohk
 darkhorse64: -3 might not be the best factor: depends a lot on the distance between checkpoints
 eulerscheZahl: i know. but i'm bad at those heuristics&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: for mars lander i could get some creative input from published puzzle solutions
 eulerscheZahl: i even have 3 different dummies there
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I should seed my GA at ML with an heuristic solution to improve convergence
 jrke: do you eval at depth 1 also euler?
 jrke: cause your choices are 6 and beam width 50
 jrke: so you can ignore eval till depth 2
 eulerscheZahl: but those are the cases where it's really few states anyways
 eulerscheZahl: at the end it's 50*6. no need to cut off the initial 6 states in sim :D
 jrke: is this time limit problem still there in SR?
 Wontonimo: for mars lander, instead of -3v, i use -35v.  it works really well
 jacek: i use around 31ms and still can get occasional timeout
 Wontonimo: This is -3v at work <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/573848553">https://www.codingame.com/replay/573848553</a>

 eulerscheZahl: i will stop the replay before it reaches the end
 jacek: why doesnt nasa hire you
 Wontonimo: :shrug:
 jacek: or trolltech
 Wontonimo: ah, sorry, i just jumped on the chat and thought we were talking mars lander
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Wontonimo: looks like it was several different things
 eulerscheZahl: mostly search race
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan would be happy if he would read the chat
 Wontonimo: ah.  i didn't do great on that.  just blindly applied my CSB bot which is optimized for chaos 
 Wontonimo: beam definitely sounds like a promising avenue
 Illedan: hm?
 Illedan: Search Race?!
 Illedan: :D
 jrke: :smiley: euler was correct!
 jacek: master race!
 Illedan: Euler doing Search Race?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm ahead of you Illedan (just to make you less happy)
 Illedan: :scream:
 Illedan: Sogeti can wait
 eulerscheZahl: we should rename it to ray-ce
 jrke: btw is there any way i can make offline submit to see my score?
 jrke: for optims
 eulerscheZahl: download the game
 eulerscheZahl: source is public
 jrke: i know that
 jrke: but i have to run each test case one by one?
 Wontonimo: if your prediction is accurate, your code only needs the first round of input.  totally run it offline
 Wontonimo: no public source needed
 Maxim251: In Tictactoe, I did delete 80% of my code, and I will try start it one more time
 Maxim251: But this time, I will use functions bit more like on this movie&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOo7UJuKsHs&amp;list=PLTxllHdfUq4d-DE16EDkpeb8Z68DU7Z_Q&amp;index=16">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOo7UJuKsHs&amp;list=PLTxllHdfUq4d-DE16EDkpeb8Z68DU7Z_Q&amp;index=16</a>
 eulerscheZahl: search race has rounding. java doesn't even follow IEEE standard
 Wontonimo: because it is for toasters
 jrke: oh lol misread `toasters`  `toaders` at first sight
 Wontonimo: and someone way back in 1994 though it would be a great idea to put it in a browser.  what could go wrong, a toaster controller for programming in the web
 eulerscheZahl: there's even strictfp as a keyword
 eulerscheZahl: if you really want to be IEEE complaint
 BlaiseEbuth: lapsus
 Maxim251: I still want use vectors, because I can store different amount of nodes, but using pointers, could be a lot easier... I think.
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm sure Illedan never heard about that one :imp:
 Wontonimo: hey Maxim251, i'm trying to peddle my flat MC tic tac toe code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/JOG9cSV">https://tech.io/snippet/JOG9cSV</a>
 Wontonimo: it may help you with ideas for bitboarding your UTTT code
 Wontonimo: I didn't use vectors at all for UTTT, and instead used pointers in my first version that got to legend
 Wontonimo: that link is a demo of solving 3x3 TTT using MC (not MCTS)
 darkhorse64: you can further improve the code by issuing moves as a mask and not as a bit to set (it saves two shifts)
 Wontonimo: definitely
 Maxim251: #Wontonimo
 darkhorse64: Another likely improvement is to replace the fancy avx wincheck by a table 
 Maxim251: Nice code, is displaying probability of the best moves....
 Wontonimo: i adopted that in my C4 code, but haven't backported it to my UTTT yet
 Maxim251: But You use concept of tree search?
 Wontonimo: yes, that's a good note.  The fancy avx is "for show".  I personally don't use it and instead use a lookup.
 Wontonimo: Maxim251 I use a tree search in my final bot yes.  It's a Upper Confidence Tree with Monty Carlo rollouts , aka MCTS
 Maxim251: I see that Uou start play code from random choices, and see how it ends, and then from that random moves calculate how many times was win, and calculate percentage of it
 Wontonimo: the link i sent isn't a final bot for UTTT, but just a demo for 3x3 TTT, that shows that Monte Carlo is quite useful, even without a tree.  A UCT makes it much more powerful though
 Maxim251: Of cource, But that give mi another way to think about that.
 Wontonimo: awesome, then it fulfilled its purpose
 Wontonimo: ideas and connections
 Maxim251: Heh, Your code is much smaller, then my previouse one :D My one was gigantic at the first time. Now when I know what I have problems with tree, I have better wision how coding part two should look. Or what I want to do now&#160;:)
 jrke: damn my clash bot is working!
 Illedan: Nope, never heard about it euler :P
 Maxim251: I have now new concept... Probably it will take next 7 days to make it roon :P
 jacek: mhm
 Wontonimo: tell me about this clash bot jrke
 FalINTOblivion0112: i am solving the puzzle of the week...
 eulerscheZahl: you have a bot for clashing? great but don't use it
 Astrobytes: Yeah, proof of concept achieved. Disable it.
 ZarthaxX: clash of bot meaning smart one?
 ZarthaxX: clash bot*
 jacek: oh abalone approved 
 ZarthaxX: maybe it's just a bot that enters games
 xxd: maybe its a twitch bot
 eulerscheZahl: and then submits from a list of known solution i suppose. updating that list when someone else publishes a better one?
 Wontonimo: oh, vry klvr
 xxd: I'd appreciate any feedback on my Clash contribution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7206774f7c01f68b28b03316b5bca1a0a27b">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7206774f7c01f68b28b03316b5bca1a0a27b</a>
 ZarthaxX: oh no i just thought it got into a game and leave
 Wontonimo: :D
 Astrobytes: Extremely not-clever at this particular point in time.
 Wontonimo: I like that
 eulerscheZahl: using a clash bot is an easy way to get some new enemies. including the community manager
 eulerscheZahl: enough said
 Wontonimo: my plan is to just let my CoC score slowly die
 eulerscheZahl: how to solve my overshooting in search race?&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes why?
 ZarthaxX: did something new happen?
 ZarthaxX: related to bots
 Wontonimo: hey, have I told you about how I solved overshooting in mars lander eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 Wontonimo: haha
 eulerscheZahl: we don't talk about that ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: Nothing public.
 ZarthaxX: mods only?
 Astrobytes: Just take it from us: don't write a clash bot and use it.
 xxd: how can i see who else is from my school
 ZarthaxX: nah im over with clash :P
 xxd: on codingame, that is
 Wontonimo: got to school
 Wontonimo: i was too slow
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global?column=schoolcompany&amp;value=SAME">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/general/global?column=schoolcompany&amp;value=SAME</a>
 Wontonimo: try that xxd
 xxd: oh, through leaderboards, gotcha
 Wontonimo: and then you can judge them at the same time you look them up
 xxd: thanks
 xxd: they're level 1 xD
 jacek: a hex game approved and MSmits isnt there already? oO
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX u so nosyy :p
 eulerscheZahl: and he's certainly not an ArthaxX. i haven't seen any usable dice yet&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: but don't worry, at the moment i'm way too lazy to touch the game anyways
 ZarthaxX: i didnt get the arthaxx
 ZarthaxX: we have been busy with gf&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: end of semester
 Astrobytes: Art-haxX. The dice art.
 eulerscheZahl: no problem
 ZarthaxX: also some training camp for her
 eulerscheZahl: Artistbytes can help
 ZarthaxX: aaand her grandma died last week
 eulerscheZahl: oh&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: and her whole family had covid too
 ZarthaxX: everything has been bad
 Astrobytes: Sorry to hear that Zartho, that's quite a run of bad luck. Wondered where you'd been.
 eulerscheZahl: i was just nagging you a bit and you replied with a horror story
 ZarthaxX: another family member died of covid three weeks ago
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl sorry&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: i didnt forgot tho :D
 Astrobytes: Damn dude, really sorry to hear that
 Wontonimo: is it really bad in South America?
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes well im personally busy with work haha
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZarthaxX: on top of all that
 eulerscheZahl: are vaccines getting an option in Argentina already?
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo yep it sucks
 ZarthaxX: i mean vaccines are being applied way more now, because we are on elections time
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: also pfizer doses coming because we are on elections time
 eulerscheZahl: here we already reached a state where we have more vaccines that people willing to get one
 ZarthaxX: that has not happened here yet
 ZarthaxX: government is still the problem
 Astrobytes: I got my date for my second dose today, and sent off my PCR test to see if I'm covid positive or just have flu
 ZarthaxX: sorry toad for the sad story, but wanted to make a summary of life
 ZarthaxX: as i havent been here anyway
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes nice and not nice
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sorry for you. one day death will get all of us
 eulerscheZahl: but that's a lot in a short timespan
 ZarthaxX: but for now, we can cg
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: oh i also won a gift card for amazon
 Astrobytes: #winning
 eulerscheZahl: how did that happen?
 ZarthaxX: there was a challenge here
 eulerscheZahl: so you won by skill and not by luck?
 ZarthaxX: i can win locally :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: ended first
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is still waiting for the smart watch</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: did you already receive your gift card?
 ZarthaxX: still owe you that tshirt
 ZarthaxX: on it
 eulerscheZahl: whatwas the challenge about?
 ZarthaxX: well that was the meme
 ZarthaxX: chuck norris codegolf
 ZarthaxX: but my solution sucked
 eulerscheZahl: that's how you won the gift card?
 ZarthaxX: yeah, sucks
 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: have you seen this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: i talked with wonto
 ZarthaxX: got to 76 on contest
 Astrobytes: which contest was this?
 ZarthaxX: i mean challenge
 eulerscheZahl: university contest?
 ZarthaxX: nono
 ZarthaxX: so last week was a special one
 ZarthaxX: many specialized courses in uni
 ZarthaxX: and many sponsors
 eulerscheZahl: 76 isn't that bad. i'm at 86 on chuck norris
 ZarthaxX: a sponsor did this challenge
 ZarthaxX: the guy that proposed the challenge had 74 chars in cg
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 KiwiTae: im at 89&#160;:( u guys too good
 ZarthaxX: yeah 86 would have been 1st place too
 eulerscheZahl: mauguignard
 ZarthaxX: mine was 135 before, but with that compression could have won
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: i did the encoding locally with python anyway
 ZarthaxX: i didnt believ in copy pasting with that tool
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: btw toad a friend just left argentina and is now living in germany
 ZarthaxX: he posted many pics, germany looks amazing
 ZweiPunktFuenf: can anyone give me a pointer on how to solve "Folding a Note"? I am really lost  : /
 eulerscheZahl: that's a big change. completely new culture and language
 ZarthaxX: totally, but i think its worth given current argentina state
 eulerscheZahl: that puzzle is too new, haven't tried it. reading time
 eulerscheZahl: even then i would probably opt for an English speaking country
 KiwiTae:  ZweiPunktFuenf just need to handle  a big matrix
 ZarthaxX: im pretty sure he studied german in school
 ZarthaxX: i would obv opt for that alternative
 ZarthaxX: :P
 eulerscheZahl: wildum moved to germany too. without speaking german before
 ZarthaxX: how did he manage to survive? haha
 eulerscheZahl: afaik he still lives here. i've met him once. a bit before the code of ice and fire contest
 ZarthaxX: oh nice!
 ZarthaxX: cg meetings
 BlaiseEbuth: About 75 years ago, that was some germans who lived germany for south america... :3
 eulerscheZahl: *left?
 BlaiseEbuth: Irregulars are for weaks.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann</a>didn't help him much
 eulerscheZahl: fled to argentina just to get kidnapped to israel and then executed
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 BlaiseEbuth: Zarthou!!!
 Astrobytes: Not sure that's the appropriate emoji Zartho, lol
 ZarthaxX: hey blaaaais
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes wdym?
 ZarthaxX: i meant to say like unfortunate
 ZarthaxX: like wtf is wrong with people
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Everything?
 Astrobytes: I mean you shouldn't feel sorry for a Nazi war criminal :D
 ZarthaxX: oh
 eulerscheZahl: you missed that part? :D
 ZarthaxX: sorry i didnt read the link
 ZarthaxX: im in "work"
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: i take that back then 
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to read the article to know what blaise was referring to
 ZarthaxX: justice
 ZarthaxX: i didnt understand blaise
 eulerscheZahl: bad english
 ZarthaxX: yeah lol
 ZarthaxX: he popped randomnly and said that lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Wasn't random.
 ZarthaxX: sorry&#160;:(
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt; deeplabel is killin me gotta reinstall ocv 
 JoseRamonMendoza: I'm going to have a job interview in an hour. I'm here to distract myself while my interview start. I'm scary AF
 KiwiTae: JoseRamonMendoza if u go for an interview u got the job. Just dont say or do anything that would make them wanna not hire u hehe
 JoseRamonMendoza: Jejejeje 
 KiwiTae: how do you dezoom the code window lol dunno how i zoomed in
 MSmits: oh I missed the daily nazi discussion
 Bob_Rocks: Can someone help me with Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1 
 Bob_Rocks: Specifically the last test case
 KiwiTae: nvm refreshed did it for me
 Bob_Rocks:&#160;:|
 KiwiTae: Bob_Rocks whats blocking?
 FalINTOblivion0112: daily nazi discussion?
 FalINTOblivion0112: whoa
 MSmits: i was just kidding 
 FalINTOblivion0112: lol
 MSmits: i scrolled up
 Bob_Rocks: KiwiTae What do you mean "what's blocking" 🤔
 MSmits: saw some weird shrt
 MSmits: sht
 FalINTOblivion0112: weird what?
 KiwiTae: You need help for it
 Bob_Rocks: Yes
 MSmits: nvm FalINTOblivion0112&#160;:)
 Bob_Rocks: KiwiTae I was doing some testing with locating the bomb, but when I go to the bomb position it's not there.
 MSmits: i wonder if the US intelligence agencies monitor this chat
 KiwiTae: last testcase might be random dont hardcode the position
 Bob_Rocks: I'
 Bob_Rocks: I'm not hardcoding the position
 Bob_Rocks: and even if it was random
 Bob_Rocks: then I would be getting that position at least some of the tiem
 Bob_Rocks: time
 BobLob: A bit off topic, but I really agree with your username, Bob_Rocks
 Bob_Rocks: Thanks BobLob lmao
 MSmits: Bob_Lobs
 Astrobytes: BobLobsRocks
 Bob_Rocks: bruh I dont understand 
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobruh
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEBruh
 Bob_Rocks: I'm going insane over this
 vulca: @Bob_Rocks: Note that the last test case has a very large field
 Bob_Rocks: Um... okay.
 Bob_Rocks: I dont really see how that helps
 Astrobytes: the running time
 Astrobytes: Big testcases will test the efficiency of your algorithm
 Bob_Rocks: It's not the efficiency that is the problem though
 Bob_Rocks: whenever I go to the exact spot where the bomb is
 Bob_Rocks: it's not there
 Astrobytes: . . .
 Shorre: What do you mean by its not there? Cant you see whats happening in the video?
 vulca: What is the game information output on the console at the step before the last step?
 KiwiTae: Bob_Rock the bomb is just not where u think it is
 Bob_Rocks: Yes I can but it's right inside of the circle 
 Astrobytes: Also, what is your approach to solving it?
 Bob_Rocks: I tried two different algorithms that I made
 Bob_Rocks: and one went to the square where the bomb was
 Bob_Rocks: and that wasn't there
 Bob_Rocks: and then another went to the square to the left (which was where the input said it was)
 Bob_Rocks: and it wasn't there either
 Bob_Rocks: Maybe it's in a quantum state in between the two squares
 Bob_Rocks: Astrobytes my approach is basically just binary search but in 2 dimensions 
 Astrobytes: Binary search is all you need yes, you must be doing something wrong at some step
 Bob_Rocks: Thanks
 Bob_Rocks: I'll keep that in mind I guess
 Astrobytes: Debug it step by step
 KiwiTae: 9755 2521 the bomb is there last test
 KiwiTae: if that helps
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 BlaiseEbuth: Bombs isn't fixed for a test
 Bob_Rocks: 🤔Yeah I dont think that's where it is
 Bob_Rocks: it's not because I just went there
 Bob_Rocks: it's because I've been going to an entirely different spot
 Bob_Rocks: and I know my code is right up until really close 
 Astrobytes: Then your code is wrong&#160;;)
 Bob_Rocks: Yeah I know it's wrong
 Bob_Rocks: thank you for the input lmao
 KiwiTae: its there cause the bomb doesnt explode for me 
 KiwiTae: hehe
 Bob_Rocks: well yeah it's randomized though
 KiwiTae: real? i replayed like 10 times always end up there
 Astrobytes: Randomised?
 Bob_Rocks: Yeah mine too 
 Bob_Rocks: that's what it does for me as well
 Bob_Rocks: but that's not where my bomb is
 BlaiseEbuth: "or some tests, the bombs' location may change from one execution to the other: the goal is to help you find the best algorithm in all cases."
 BlaiseEbuth: *for
 KiwiTae: on validator maybe 
 Astrobytes: Oh. Been a while since I did that one.
 KiwiTae: same 2016 maybe&#160;:/
 KiwiTae: 200lines of c# somehow lol
 Astrobytes: lol, hey, you live and learn&#160;:)
 Bob_Rocks: I have like 300 lines of java
 Bob_Rocks: :pensive:
 Bob_Rocks: I'm so bad
 Astrobytes: No, you're just stuck for the moment.
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop using java, stop being bad.
 Astrobytes: Log everything to stderr and work through it to see where you're going wrong
 Bob_Rocks: Astrobytes I've been doing that
 Bob_Rocks: I did it nevermind 🤮 I'm actually terrible
 Bob_Rocks: I shorted it down to 33 lines though
 Astrobytes: what was the problem?
 Bob_Rocks: Everything
 Bob_Rocks: I just rewrote the entire thing and probably got lucky
 Astrobytes: I see
 Bob_Rocks: Being stuck on a medium puzzle yikes
 Astrobytes: It happens, don't worry about it.
 FalINTOblivion0112: you mean the puzzle of the week?
 FalINTOblivion0112: i couldnt solve it either
 Astrobytes: No, it was Batman.
 Astrobytes: (Shadows of the Knight)
 FalINTOblivion0112: ahhh
 FalINTOblivion0112: i really need help on puzzle of the week lol
 Astrobytes: Haven't done it, sorry
 BlaiseEbuth: Useless mod...
 FalINTOblivion0112: hey astrobytes is a good mod
 BlaiseEbuth: What's a good mod...
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway, I wasn't. And Astrobytes looks too much like me to be one...
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobuth
 AstroHydes: I'm a mood god.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's true.
 Astrobytes: And I'm the good mod.
 FalINTOblivion0112: AstroHydes?
 FalINTOblivion0112: funny lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's an alt account
 Astrobytes: For testing things, testing contribs, etc etc
 Astrobytes: And chatting during busy contests, cause the chat gets laggy af
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh, the chat is faster with your alt&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, cause it's not got the moderator list of users
 BlaiseEbuth: :o
 Illedan: Nice jolindien
 jolindien: thanks&#160;:)
 jolindien: but far from pb
 Illedan: Yeah, that is another level
 jolindien: yep
 Astrobytes: Nice. Good job jolindien. And you Illedan.
 jolindien: yes gg Illedan
 Illedan: Still 24 hours
 Astrobytes: + possibility of dapo
 Illedan: Let's just hope pb4 thinks he is safe
 Astrobytes: Whether he can wreck pb4 is another story
 Astrobytes: Yeah&#160;:)
 jolindien: he isn't&#160;?
 Illedan: I'm having my hopes high!
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Illedan: Maybe I find the magic eval all of a sudden.
 KiwiTae: staying close to budgers?
 KiwiTae: gg Illedan

 heloche: hello guys
 Deathshotxxx: :wave:
 heloche: is anyone hiring&#160;? I do HTML and my annual salary is USD150k
 ZarthaxX: lmao, isnt that too much?
 MSmits: *I do html *
 MSmits: noone does html
 MSmits: people code websites these days or use wordpress or something
 MSmits: writing direct html seems relatively unimportant
 eemsnayr: yes
 eemsnayr: zarthaxx hit me up on nsa.gov
 ZarthaxX: MSmits you can still do it anyway lmao
 MSmits: well ok :P
 ZarthaxX: eemsnayr aight, going buddy
 ZarthaxX: i did it :c
 MSmits: in fact I "do" html with my students
 ZarthaxX: you see? :P
 MSmits: but thats just so they know how websites work. If you do this professionally, I assume you'll always use some language to autogenerate the html
 MSmits: but what do I know, I'm not a pro :P
 MSmits: though if anyone is paying 150k for html, let me know
 ZarthaxX: ah ye you would use a framework
 ZarthaxX: like reactjs
 ZarthaxX: which i still couldnt finish lol
 ZarthaxX: IT salaries are high :P
 yamin2000: this very hard for me , i am 2 months in programming .is it normal&#160;?

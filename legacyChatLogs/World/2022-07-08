 PatrickMcGinnisII: finally gonna submit this thing again after so many months...or is it years?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/650156857">https://www.codingame.com/replay/650156857</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kewl, promoted to silver
 struct: grats
 PatrickMcGinnisII: over 900 in silver, omg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, rank 506 ... from over 1.4k in rank.  I'll take it ... for now
 Mr_Zhao-xin: For the first time, who can help me:smile_cat:
 jacek: huh
 Mr_Zhao-xin: don‘t huh, I‘m, rookie Xiaobai
 Mr_Zhao-xin: Is there anything you can refer to?
 Alec801: :eye::lips::eye:
 Mr_Zhao-xin: ah, algorithms, games, I thought it was Js
 derjack: it is many languages. python, java, c++..
 Mr_Zhao-xin: yes,l see
 VictorVale: yo
 Mr_Zhao-xin: why can't I set the PNG format of upload avatar? What format does it support?
 jacek: it supports PNG. :thinking:
 Mr_Zhao-xin: I choose PNG image, but it prompts unsupported file
 Mr_Zhao-xin: why？:sweat:
 jacek: too big?
 Mr_Zhao-xin: I don't know. my picture is only 12.4kb
 jacek: :shrug_tone1:
 Mr_Zhao-xin: Well, pictures above 2m are OK:scream_cat:
 jacek: is it really png
 Mr_Zhao-xin: I chose png
 Mr_Zhao-xin: forget it, continue to learn Vue project, and stop fishing
 TimeEngineer: Maybe you can try another image :thinking: and see if it works
 Mr_Zhao-xin: I've tried many, but I can't. It's estimated that the file is too small
 TimeEngineer: Scale it&#160;?
 Mr_Zhao-xin: By the way, how big are the avatars you uploaded?
 Aldoggen: about 400 by 400
 TimeEngineer: 185x185 14.4kB
 Mr_Zhao-xin: Mine is 500x500 12.1kb why not :sob:
 jacek: does imgur.com accept it?
 Mr_Zhao-xin: I uploaded a 2.61mb image, and the personal settings are displayed. Is there an audit?
 DrunkeyCPP: in ruby:eval "010+2" = 10
 DrunkeyCPP: could someone explain me why?
 Aldoggen: 010 probably evaluates to octal
 Aldoggen: so it would be 8
 Aldoggen: idk tho
 Ayza: yea it's what you said
 j4at: yeah if a number starts with 0 then it gets evaluated to octal
 DrunkeyCPP: oh I see, thanks
 pluieciel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0507296d-3ea7-43c6-9a7d-73fad88cebb4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0507296d-3ea7-43c6-9a7d-73fad88cebb4</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: :think:
 pluieciel: Hi, I have a question. When we need to search for a path BFS/DFS from Start to End, what is the difference between begin from Start and begin from End. What should I google to find something related? Thanks a lot
 DrunkeyCPP: well one may take more time than the other depending how you built your graph
 MSmits: plutieciel you can have multiple ends or multiple starts but not both
 MSmits: pluieciel
 MSmits: so if you have 1 start, you can have multiple ends
 MSmits: or 1 end, with multiple starts
 MSmits: it just finds the closest one
 pluieciel: if i am sure there is only one Start and one End
 pluieciel: fyi, i am doing The Fall 
 MSmits: then it is like DrunkeyCPP said. If for example., the start has an enormous amount of branching, starting there is slower
 MSmits: because you're going in all directionds at once
 MSmits: just to be clear, i never did anything other than starting at the start. Didnt even consider starting at the end
 Mr_Zhao-xin: today is historic moment?
 jacek: MSmits depends if you start from opening books or ending books
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: btw, I now have versions that beat my old uttt bot 55% but are worse on the leaderboard (overfitted&#160;:( )
 MSmits: gonna need to put some random in old bot and new bot
 MSmits: I'm sure the teccles heuristic doesnt help with this either
 MSmits: same first 20 moves every time
 MSmits: well for p1 anyways
 jacek: yeah it sucks when it overfits
 jacek: i have locally c4 version that beat my bot 80% but its much worse in leaderboard
 MSmits: yeah, i underestimated the overfitting that is possible in uttt
 MSmits: probably because of the heuristics 
 jacek: thats why i kept different versions of bots for green circle
 MSmits: smart
 jacek: one of early attempts <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/IxDRaQf.png">https://i.imgur.com/IxDRaQf.png</a>
 jacek: blue one is vs random and red one is vs 1st action
 MSmits: ohh ok
 jacek: you can winrate drops to below 20% even while it beats the stronger bots
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: more stable learning <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/bEYrN8c.png">https://i.imgur.com/bEYrN8c.png</a>
 MSmits: what did you do differently with that one?
 jacek: bigger model and better gamma parameter
 MSmits: ah ok
 User_xin: I can't open it. Maybe my Google should decorate something
 jacek: i have several such graphs each for some different hyperparameters
 MSmits: right, that helps
 TimeEngineer: jacek, is that normal my dqn can't reach 90% draw against himself with eps = 0.1&#160;? (Tic Tac Toe)
 jacek: helps because my q-learning implementation sucks and was 1-core only. so i ran several tests in parallel
 User_xin: mogul？
 jacek: could be. personally i never did dqn for TTT but i read it can be quite messy
 jacek: well, i did q-table and it worked perfectly
 TimeEngineer: :thinking:
 MSmits: mmh you just put all states in a table?
 MSmits: that works, but is a bit trivial&#160;:)
 MSmits: I guess it may give better results than minimax though
 jacek: quick search <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://the-mvm.github.io/deep-q-learning-tic-tac-toe.html">https://the-mvm.github.io/deep-q-learning-tic-tac-toe.html</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/@carsten.friedrich/part-4-neural-network-q-learning-a-tic-tac-toe-player-that-learns-kind-of-2090ca4798d">https://medium.com/@carsten.friedrich/part-4-neural-network-q-learning-a-tic-tac-toe-player-that-learns-kind-of-2090ca4798d</a>
 TimeEngineer: Yeah, if I need a proper solution, I prefer minmax
 MSmits: yeah but minimax doesnt deal with suboptimal players very well
 MSmits: it will have more draws
 jacek: they cant achieve perfection despite big models
 jacek: yeah my 1-ply ntuple has more wins against random than the perfect player against random
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple">https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple</a>
 jacek: simply because it chooses center at the beginning which leads to more losing states for random players
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: not vs human btw
 MSmits: humans tend to memorize how to counter center start
 MSmits: so randomly starting as p1 is good
 TimeEngineer: Maybe a random among the best move
 MSmits: thats what i usually do
 MSmits: starting moves for p1 are all solved as draw
 TimeEngineer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c9b183d-7be7-43a1-911d-724718d13a65">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c9b183d-7be7-43a1-911d-724718d13a65</a>
 MSmits: so thats basically randoming 1st move
 TimeEngineer: wut

 TimeEngineer: Ok ._.
 BlaiseEbuth: :popcorn:
 jacek: i totally agree with whats written there
 User_xin: well
 User_xin: Off duty, everyone
 jacek: oO
 User_xin: The weekend begins
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: time to deploy into prod
 BlaiseEbuth: No more chat
 MSmits: whwn?
 MSmits: when
 TimeEngineer: Thanks jacek and MSmits
 MSmits: for?
 BlaiseEbuth: They said "next week" last week, so today. Or it's again reported...
 TimeEngineer: For the explanation
 MSmits: oh ok np
 jacek: maybe french week is different
 User_xin: lol
 MSmits: could be they have a siesta like Spanish people, only it's the whole week
 MSmits: this is my working theory
 User_xin: france: are you polite?
 Aldoggen: in belgium we call this vacation
 BlaiseEbuth: Perhaps in Montpellier :thinking:
 MSmits: Pfft die Belgen, altijd op vakantie
 Aldoggen: ik wist dat je een nederlander was&#160;;)
 MSmits: hehe lets stop
 Aldoggen: okay, back to english
 MSmits: or the mods tick off
 BlaiseEbuth: First warning MSmits
 Aldoggen: yep, I was thinking it too
 MSmits: :P
 Aldoggen: you have no power here BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: No more...
 User_xin: Can I speak Chinese?？
 Aldoggen: yes, but not in this chat lol
 MSmits: how do you know he can?
 MSmits: I can't
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 User_xin: 周末到了
 5DN1L: User_xin use #cn channel for Chinese please
 User_xin: is  the weekend is here
 User_xin:  i Know
 User_xin: goodbye, everyone. see you next week
 Afraaz1: for the easy rock paper scissor lizzard spock challenge
 Afraaz1: is there a way to work out who wins without lots of if statements?&gt;
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: well you can do a lookup
 MSmits: put the information in an array[5][5]
 Aldoggen: you could identify each of the things with a number mod 5
 MSmits: right
 afstydfb: yo
 afstydfb: i need help
 afstydfb: im stuck on the space ship thing
 Aldoggen: but I did it with some if statements
 afstydfb: the code doesnt work
 afstydfb: it literally doesnt
 afstydfb: help pls
 afstydfb: send help pls
 Aldoggen: what error does it give?
 afstydfb: one sec

 afstydfb: Thats It
 afstydfb: I cant
 afstydfb: fix it
 Aldoggen: afstydfb first error means your program runs slow
 afstydfb: i use lua btw
 Aldoggen: maybe you have an infinite loop
 MSmits: or maybe he uses lua :P
 afstydfb: hgow
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 MSmits: j/k
 afstydfb: lua is ez for me but yes
 afstydfb: this one is hard
 MSmits: puzzles should work in any language
 afstydfb: idk why
 derjack: mad pod racing?
 afstydfb: right
 afstydfb: YES
 afstydfb: map pod racing
 afstydfb: lua landuage
 afstydfb: :grimacing:
 Aldoggen: so nextCheckpoint is nil
 Aldoggen: hmm
 afstydfb: can i share this
 derjack: huh? is this default code?
 Aldoggen: was your pod almost at the end?
 5DN1L: should be something like nextCheckpointX. nextCheckpointY?
 Aldoggen: ah right
 afstydfb: wrong
 afstydfb: i tried that earlier
 5DN1L: what's nextCheckpoint
 Aldoggen: uninstantiated variables are probably nil
 Aldoggen: well rip
 afstydfb: should i try add more checkpoints?
 5DN1L: we don't know what nextCheckpoint holds in your code
 afstydfb: hm
 afstydfb: ok
 5DN1L: we can't advise based on your description so far
 afstydfb: wait
 afstydfb: ill try sum
 afstydfb: YES
 afstydfb: the pod moves to checkpoint 3
 5DN1L: If you're in Wood 3, you just have to amend the line of code where you print stuff
 afstydfb: but then flies over
 5DN1L: shouldn't be necessary to change anything else
 afstydfb: how can i share replays
 afstydfb: i got the code
 derjack: there is share icon under the replay screen
 afstydfb: but it flies over ther check point
 derjack: you can share code using pastebin.com
 afstydfb: k
 afstydfb: sorry guys i gtg
 afstydfb: but i think i fixed the code
 afstydfb: so yea
 afstydfb: cya
 derjack: :tada:
 NglQ: Guys, I'd like to ask something to you: at the beginning when I signed up to this platform there used to be a button called "get a job". Now I cannot find it anywhere. Some of you guys knows what happened?
 5DN1L: removed
 NglQ: Why?
 derjack: everyone got a job
 5DN1L: 🎉
 NglQ: @5DN1L I'm serious why did you removed it?
 5DN1L: I didn't remove it
 5DN1L: I'm not CG staff
 NglQ: OK 
 NglQ: So you don't know why?
 5DN1L: i was searching
 5DN1L: i found the reason told by Thibaud in Discord
 5DN1L: 29/03/2022 "this service is going to end very soon, as we've decided to shut it down. "
 NglQ: Thank you
 5DN1L: np
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not a reason... :thinking:
 5DN1L: ending the service is a reason for removing the button
 5DN1L: they could also have said for asethetic reason :shrug:
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah...
 Lachrymosa: H O W D A R E
 derjack: :upside_down:
 MSmits: I turned off teccles heuristic and added 1% randomness to my best bot and now evalbot has 75% WR against it...
 MSmits: not sure if testing like this is better :P
 Lachrymosa: what game?
 MSmits: uttt
 Lachrymosa: Man, I tried my hand at that one. I still struggle with simulation and state evaluation for MM and similar algos
 MSmits: state evaluation is hard in uttt
 MSmits: but simulation is a safe option as long as you have no bugs
 derjack: 1% randomness?
 derjack: 1% to make totally random move?
 MSmits: no add max 0.01 to value of move
 MSmits: tiny randomness
 MSmits: but if i look at some early game output it's like this:
 MSmits: move 7 6 value: 0.329956 visits: 7968 [-1,1]move 7 8 value: 0.326269 visits: 7128 [-1,1]move 8 6 value: 0.322324 visit
 MSmits: so 0.01 could do the trick
 derjack: youre addin that during final move selection?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it plays worse, so i guess it worked
 MSmits: losing the teccles heuristic may have hurt more though
 MSmits: ohh I have an diea
 MSmits: idea
 MSmits: maybe I should give my best bot more calc time
 derjack: you have the same time or iterations?
 MSmits: time
 MSmits: gives a bit more randomness than iterations does
 derjack: if you use xorshift make sure your seed isnt 0...
 MSmits: it's not =)
 Lachrymosa: Is there a way to see a "Last logged in" stat on a user?
 5DN1L: I guess not. You may try checking out their profile on the forum, but that's correct only if they visit the forum when they last log in
 Lachrymosa: I just miss SamSi and wish they'd log on sometime. Haven't seen them in like 5-6 years now though
 5DN1L: ah I remember they created some puzzles here
 struct: derjack do you use normal UCB1 for your NN MCTS?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: or jacekmax
 MSmits: might be worth it to use other formulas. There are better ones but they are much more expensive. With the low number of rollouts that might not be a problem
 MSmits: Thomsen sampling is one
 jacek: i havent investigated those
 jacek: well i was reading about them when i used non-nn mcts
 jacek: since nn stuff is expensive anyway, why not try
 MSmits: yeah
 krishna636: krishna636 06:42ᴾᴹhi guys, is there any exercise for learning java Builder
 MSmits: I dont think so
 MSmits: not here
 krishna636: ok thanks!
 jacek: builder pattern?
 MSmits: mostly puzzles are not aimed at learning the basics. They are mostly aimed at using what you know and becoming better at it
 krishna636: yeah builder pattern
 MSmits: they are also language-agnostic. You dont learn specific language features here
 krishna636: I saw somewhere code like new Class.Builder().setVariable() like this
 jacek: puzzles here generally dont teach you about programming patterns
 MSmits: they do motivate you to look for them elsewhere
 krishna636: hmm got it:thumbsup:
 MSmits: CG motivates you to visit stack overflow
 krishna636: although I'm finding puzzles here very tough
 krishna636: CG?
 MSmits: just try a bunch of easy ones until you find one you can solve
 MSmits: codingame
 krishna636: ok
 MSmits: when i got here i had problems solving puzzles too
 MSmits: now i can pretty much solve them all if i take the time. Some do take a lot of time, most dont
 krishna636: should I start with algorithms?
 krishna636: or data structure :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: thats not really a clear question
 MSmits: everything is am algorithm basically
 MSmits: an
 MSmits: CG does allow you to practice algorithms a lot
 krishna636: I accidentally stumbled in this website
 krishna636: is this better sorted than leetcode or geeksforgeeks
 MSmits: data structure i dunno. I guess in a way you do need to have an easy to use datastructure for every puzzle and arena, but they wont look like structures you would use at a dev job
 MSmits: sorted? you mean by difficulty?
 MSmits: if so, then no, its not very welll sorte
 krishna636: I mean does CG have better questions to crack interviews
 krishna636: or just for fun
 jacek: there are categories but some easy puzzles can be more difficult than others
 krishna636: I mean does this help me with my dev job
 MSmits: there are lots of dev jobs
 krishna636: I just want to improve my quality of code
 krishna636: in jav
 MSmits: if your dev job is web dev, then this site is useless to you
 MSmits: except for fun
 SatelliteMaster1337: do both you need dara structure to solve algorithm but if you just do data structures its dry and out of context
 Martini310: siema!
 MSmits: if you are going to do stuff with neural networks, or data science and such, then this site would be nice practice
 krishna636: ohh.. I see
 krishna636: but I will give it a try
 krishna636: seems like nice community
 MSmits: sure is
 MSmits: this chat will go away soon though, but the discord will be there
 krishna636: yeah I will join discord :slight_smile:
 sakib_shahon: I can solve some of the problems with algorithms or math. But I can't really find any step by step guide for developing more advanced stuff like genetic algorithms or training neural networks.
 MSmits: i think i should adapt my meta mcts framework to fit params, like a GA or something
 sakib_shahon: Any Idea where I can find good resources for that?
 struct: There is a huge gap between ga and NN
 MSmits: i know
 krishna636: meta mcts?
 MSmits: if you learn what mcts is, i can tell you what meta mcts is krishna636
 MSmits: otherwise it is too much at once
 jacek: sakib_shahon try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 struct: sakib_shahon <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/genetic-algorithms/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/genetic-algorithms/</a>
 Nerchio: meta mcts is when you take mcts and add meta to it
 struct: I think this one is decent
 MSmits: struct, i mostly mean to use the GA or whatever, to train params locally
 struct: I only tried ga once tbh
 MSmits: not to train nn
 struct: i was talking to sakib msmits
 jacek: i managed to train nmm with GA before switching to nn
 MSmits: it would be much better than the current brute force uttt arena i use, it often hangs and it slow and single threaded
 sakib_shahon: Well I know the theory of this stuff... But I am really bad at learning without coding it out.
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: single threaded :scream:
 sakib_shahon: For both ga and nn
 MSmits: yeah my meta mcts can run 12 processes, np. But this program is old
 MSmits: It'd be nice to have a GA that also gives some intermediate results, maybe some of those pretty graphs jacek makes
 sakib_shahon: Is there a chance to look at others codes for the same game I am playing here?
 MSmits: I could use a single bot that it starts an instance of and then feeds it param values
 MSmits: which game? PRobably not
 sakib_shahon: mad pod
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 sakib_shahon: or code vs zombie
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Inoryy/csb-ai-starter">https://github.com/Inoryy/csb-ai-starter</a>
 struct: that one is mad pod racing
 MSmits: csb is the old abbreviation, before renamed
 MSmits: code vs zombie can be hardcoded
 MSmits: i just have a simple sim and monte carlo that reaches like rank 300
 jacek: games are 'competition', there are no codes from others. but some people share and you may find some of them in github
 MSmits: but hardcoded solution is top 30
 sakib_shahon: I am getting stuck after bronze . And improving the code seems too hacky for case. A lot pro's seems to know stuff I haven't even heard about
 jacek: try -3vel
 sakib_shahon: *for my case
 MSmits: a lot of pro's do, but they also hardcode
 struct: a lot of pros just sim the game and run a  search
 MSmits: and yeah try -3vel for mad pod racing if you want a nice rank before moving on to  a different game
 MSmits: (mid gold)
 MSmits: it's a cheesy trick
 sakib_shahon: Any youtube channel or blogs to follow thats particularly good?
 jacek: or no to waste a time on incomplete rules leagues
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey hey. use my starter and go legend. ezpz
 struct: I dont really know any channel that explains this stuff usually I just search the algo I want to use
 sakib_shahon: Thanks guys for helping out. One of the reasons why I love the tech communities is that there's always helpful people around. And somehow the more they knows the more helpful they are.
 MSmits: talking to people gives you ideas often
 jacek: i dont know any book, i just randomly search stuff on the internet ;d
 MSmits: yeah and sometimes the stuff he searches is about coding
 sakib_shahon: I might be hardcoding things for quite some time i guess.
 MSmits: if you want to learn a real search algoritm, do a simple boardgame like ultimate tic tac toe and then learn minimax and monte carlo tree search
 WoBo727: Free my man ASHLEY1
 D1LAN: FREE ASHLEY 1
 MSmits: its good to start there because the game is simple and the algorithms require no adaptatiom
 sakib_shahon: Ok I guess I will start with minimax and monte carlo
 MSmits: nono
 MSmits: monte carlo tree search
 MSmits: monte carlo is something else
 MSmits: the tree search is important
 sakib_shahon: monte carlo tree search
 sakib_shahon: got it
 MSmits: yes, mcts
 Astrobytes: though it might be better to start with flat MC 
 MSmits: not in uttt i think
 MSmits: probably better to try minimax firt
 Astrobytes: for learning purposes
 MSmits: less buggy
 Astrobytes: aCat was high gold with flat mc in java
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: then yeah it might be good too
 sakib_shahon: It would really be nice to have one or two purely educational and introductory games for some of the common techniques .
 Astrobytes: just thinking in terms of difficulty gradient
 MSmits: ok so monte carlo -&gt; minimax -&gt; monte carlo tree search
 MSmits: thats the right order of difficulty i think
 Astrobytes: Yes sakib, we thought about that before
 struct: maybe I can make normal TTT
 Astrobytes: still think it's a good idea tbh
 struct: where you play vs minimax
 BlaiseEbuth: Simple mc excercise&#160;?
 struct: but as a puzzle
 Astrobytes: bunch of simple board games just to test on
 MSmits: sounds good struct
 MSmits: btw gotta go train arriving ttyl
 struct: cya
 Aldoggen: ttt as a puzzle exists already?
 sakib_shahon: I'll stick to this than&#160;: monte carlo -&gt; minimax -&gt; monte carlo tree search
 Aldoggen: yo
 struct: not interactive Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: oh
 struct: i mean turn based I guess
 Aldoggen: yep
 struct: This is a decent video for minimax sakib
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI</a>
 Astrobytes: ah Sebastian 'The Accent' Lague
 Astrobytes: yeah he's very clear and easy to understand
 sakib_shahon: thanks struct
 jacek: wood league of UTTT is TTT
 Astrobytes: Yeah but something specifically designed with noobs in mind would be better
 BlaiseEbuth: noobs
 jacek: i can make a boss :imp:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Aldoggen: I think if you implement some proper algorithm, you'll be out of wood really quickly
 Aldoggen: so it doesn't give much time to explore
 Astrobytes: you can get out of wood in UTTT by doing much less than that
 Astrobytes: so even less time to explore
 Astrobytes: I wish CG had got on board with the 'noobs corner' idea
 BlaiseEbuth: Not a priority.
 BlaiseEbuth: But he told the devs about it. :ok_hand:
 jacek: oh my, japanese former pm died
 eulerscheZahl: he got shot, didn't he?
 jacek: by former marine
 Westicles: they should ban homemade guns
 eulerscheZahl: if someone really wants, they'll find a way. but that doesn't mean that you have to make it easy for them. i'm in the "ban guns" fraction
 BlaiseEbuth: :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: and 2nd amendment was written at a time with wild animals and no police. it's ridiculous to still argue with it
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they think they can defend themselves against the corona virus with a gun :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Nah. They've bleach for that
 Westicles: there are a bazillion deer in the US, they are begging us to shoot most of them
 Westicles: plus the canadians could attack any time
 eulerscheZahl: then build a wall and make Canada pay for it?
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil:
 Westicles: I wouldn't want to get in a knife fight with a German, you guys are evolving into vicious killers
 Westicles: over a million stabbings in Germany just last month
 darkhorse64:&#160;??
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. With almost 250 mass shootings since january 1st, we can nothing but observe the benefits of guns on the US public security...
 struct: enough of this non sense
 BlaiseEbuth: Non sense&#160;?

 jacek: darn inflation
 Westicles: we pushed it out to after Bastille day in the morning meeting
 jacek: bastille day?
 darkhorse64: 14th July
 jacek: 14th july?
 Astrobytes: 15th is Pastille Day, when everyone is hoarse from drinking and shouting and must take throat-soothing lozenges

 jacek: if i logged in, wheres the chat
 Astrobytes: it's more functional than it was when I checked before though
 BlaiseEbuth: In which way?
 Astrobytes: when I logged in there was something there
 Westicles: we took that offline after the morning meeting
 Astrobytes: List of users on the right etc, the menu button
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes. So why 'more'&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It wasn't there yesterday
 Astrobytes: for me
 BlaiseEbuth: :upside_down:

 jacek: not real?&#160;:(
 TobiasA: when you guys use NN  model made in python in c++
 TobiasA: how*
 MSmits: a NN model is just a bunch of weights
 MSmits: you just need to make sure it is outputted and inputted correctly
 jacek: its just bunch of floats
 MSmits: and the math in the python model needs to correspond to the same math in the c++ forward
 jacek: and you need to make NN forward only
 jacek: :rage:
 MSmits: you can take a break jacek, i can handle it from here :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: dont forget to avx it
 jacek: nah, just autovectorize it
 jacek: compilers smart
 MSmits: if you want to use 8 bit floats, it takes some doing
 TobiasA: oh so you have to make a NN from scratch in c++ but with only feed forward?
 struct: or try both ways
 MSmits: yes TobiasA
 MSmits: it's not that much work, the work is in figuring out how to put the nn weights in the c++ file, encoded and decoded properly
 struct: wdym by 8 bit floats?
 MSmits: you can't just dump a bunch of numbers
 struct: dont you convert them to normal floats when reading them?
 TobiasA: damn i figured it will be something like that but I was hoping there will be a shortcut:cry:
 MSmits: no, 8 bit float math is faster and can be avx-ed better
 MSmits: afaik
 struct: ah ok
 MSmits: robo does it
 struct: The forward part is the easy part
 struct: The rest is the hard part
 MSmits: TobiasA use marchetes github
 MSmits: he did all this work for you
 MSmits: just copy it and try to understand it
 jacek: its good to have slaves eh

 Astrobytes: MSmits-&gt;score++;
 MSmits: :bow:
 TobiasA: thanks
 MSmits: I am a bit frustrated fitting params for my uttt eval bot
 MSmits: I was hoping i'd get further brute forcing fitting them
 struct: still rank 9
 BlaiseEbuth: Make a NN to fitt them for you
 MSmits: but all I do is get ridiculous winrates vs my rank 9 bot
 MSmits: thats my old bot
 MSmits: my eval bot can get like 60-70% WR vs it
 MSmits: but not vs the rest
 MSmits: so it's overfitted majorly
 MSmits: I can get rank 12 with evalbot
 TobiasA: wait is it possible to use tensorflow on CG 
 MSmits: no not directly
 MSmits: you use tensorflow locally
 MSmits: and export the model
 MSmits: then import into your c++ bot
 MSmits: marchete has a working implementation for you
 TobiasA: oh thanks
 MSmits: there's like 10 marchete clones on oware leaderboard
 MSmits: I was going to say you can recognize them by being ranked above me
 MSmits: but i forgot i counterbooked them all
 TobiasA: I thought I had to create a NN from scratch 
 MSmits: nope, well thats what jacek did
 jacek: all the cool kids in top15 use NN. and MSmits
 MSmits: and msmits doesnt :P
 jacek: there are cool kids and there is MSmits
 MSmits: i got the message jacek, but thanks for clarifying :P
 BlaiseEbuth: MSmits is a cool adult
 MSmits: thanks BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: confirmed by your old student who was on here
 Astrobytes: who said you were a cool teacher
 MSmits: ah yeah&#160;:)
 jacek: especially when he was watching

 Astrobytes: I only remembered the joo part
 Astrobytes: very dutch
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: He has a bunch of friends from my school but i dont even know them all
 MSmits: on CG i  mean
 Astrobytes: hope they keep active
 Astrobytes: at least you showed them the way
 MSmits: doubt it, at that age life is busy
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: true
 struct: They should be making NNs by now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't figure out how to bitb Counting TTT, any hints?  I'm stuck with one long array atm
 Astrobytes: just crash
 Astrobytes: or whatever does it
 MSmits: I cheat in that game PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: that game is broken
 MSmits: I copy opponent
 MSmits: until i can solve the game
 MSmits: solver is reasonably good, so that works vs weaker players
 MSmits: draws vs strong
 struct: PatrickMcGinnisII the game is solved as a draw
 MSmits: well thats not a real problem
 struct: even php can do it
 MSmits: the problem is that is is always solved by copying
 struct: ofc yeah
 Astrobytes: hence broken
 MSmits: yeah, serious oversight
 Astrobytes: did the author refuse to fix it or just never responded?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, i musta missed something ... mirror moves?
 MSmits: yes mirror
 jacek: read the forum
 Astrobytes: yes thanks dad
 MSmits: i guess you can look at it the way RPS tournaments work
 Astrobytes: I was looking for a faster answer
 MSmits: if you do the copy thing, you can never get 1st
 MSmits: unless everyone copies
 struct: maybe I can train a NN for RPS?
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: if 1 guy doesnt copy, he beats other peoplee that dont copy and are weaker
 MSmits: so gets a better rating
 MSmits: so in a way counting ttt still works
 Astrobytes: copy with enough variation and you'll win
 MSmits: how do you copy with variation?
 Astrobytes: at the end
 struct: ok maybe I cant, it sounds too hard
 Astrobytes: copy, vary the end
 MSmits: right, thats what i do with the solver
 jacek: ezpz struct <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dennylslee/rock-paper-scissors-LSTM/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/dennylslee/rock-paper-scissors-LSTM/blob/master/README.md</a>
 Astrobytes: like in RPS, copy first few times, then throw them with a different move
 MSmits: but then the other guy can still copy
 MSmits: you cant beat copiers that way
 Astrobytes: Also: regarding "how do you copy with variation" -&gt; see DNA/RNA
 PatrickMcGinnisII: end game still needs streamlined gamestates ... unless I do/undo on same board
 struct: im too dumb for this jacek
 MSmits: too smart i think struct
 Astrobytes: MSmits: you can, copy judiciously and play variations based on what they are expecting
 MSmits: in counting TTT?
 MSmits: what stops them from copying you?
 Astrobytes: oh I thought we were still talking about RPS
 MSmits: ohh ok, 
 MSmits: i wasnt
 MSmits: i was just saying that counting TTT is like RPS
 Astrobytes: I gathered that :D
 MSmits: the copy guys all draw against eachother but get no wins
 MSmits: the other guys fight amongst themselves and the best wins
 MSmits: that person is at the top of the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Yes, hence the need for the variation, as in RPS :P
 MSmits: so in that sense the game is not broken
 Astrobytes: It's just lame
 MSmits: yeah it takes the fun out of it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, it's 100 turns ... how far from the endgame can yall reach?
 MSmits: I don't remember. Only a few turns i think
 MSmits: maybe 10?
 Astrobytes: donno, never bothered with it after that
 struct: if draw bots gets spam submited the leaderboard will be all equal
 MSmits: I can check, sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/649029716">https://www.codingame.com/replay/649029716</a>
 MSmits: solved at frame 187
 MSmits: thats why i win with +2
 MSmits: but if he kept copying me after i solved, we would have drawn
 MSmits: wait, no he messed up at the start
 MSmits: if you notice the leaderboard, tric trac and royale are way higher rated. They don't copy
 MSmits: rating-wise you see a whole bunch with 33, then above that, two 37s
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, I'm still sure there's a way to quick bitblt the 3 in a rows
 MSmits: probably
 struct: now i want to know how to multiply 32 floats at once
 jacek: like nnue?
 struct: yes
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md#quantization">https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md#quantization</a>
 MSmits: value += float(FastRand(100)) / float(10000);   This adds max 0,01 to my node value right?
 MSmits: I am surprised my WR goes from 45% down to 25% if i do this, it's devastating
 jacek: max 0,0099
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but it's really devastating to my bot
 MSmits: this surprises me
 jacek: is it cumulative
 MSmits: I thought i'd generate some extra random this way
 MSmits: nope
 struct: MSmits on node value?
 struct: or on select?
 MSmits: just at the end of the 100 ms
 MSmits: final move selection
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx MSmits, looks like u found solution at 12 turns to end in first setup, then 7 til end in second ... but the advantage was only by 2 points...wow
 jacek: it should do nothing unless all your moves are withing 0.01
 MSmits: thats because i copy almost the whole game
 jacek: then its problem somewhere else
 MSmits: well to be fair a lot of moves are within 0,01
 MSmits: in the early game
 jacek: why dont you introduce randomness in ucb like me
 struct: This is why you need rollout N depth MSmits
 MSmits: i tried today struct
 struct: didnt work?
 MSmits: WR went down massivel
 struct: lol
 MSmits: 65% became 45%, then 30%
 struct: I remember that I read it on a bt paper
 struct: but cant find it anymore
 jacek: ept?
 struct: thats where I got the idea from
 MSmits: i remember from oware i had a random rollout parameter
 struct: I guess so jacek
 MSmits: when my eval wasnt fitted very well, 4 or 5 deep was good
 struct: they recommended 6-8 depth on rollout then eval
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300114670_Early_Playout_Termination_in_MCTS">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300114670_Early_Playout_Termination_in_MCTS</a>
 MSmits: as the eval became better, 0 was best
 MSmits: think of it this way: Wat is the best rollout depth with perfect eval?
 MSmits: what
 MSmits: 0 right"?
 MSmits: so as eval gets better, your rollout depth should go to 0
 MSmits: and this is why NN's use 0
 MSmits: because their eval is amazing
 struct: yeah my eval is bad thats why it worked
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: which means my uttt eval is pretty good i guess
 MSmits: only it's still overfitted
 struct: my eval never goes above 0.1
 struct: but the rollout makes it be 1 sometimes
 struct: So thats why it worked I guess
 MSmits: mmh
 MSmits: maybe you need to think about your param values
 struct: probably
 MSmits: they need to be in good relation with the exploration param
 MSmits: i usually keep the exp param at 1
 struct: I do score_1 - score_0
 MSmits: and then fit the other ones to a good value compared to that 1
 struct: Which make it pretty bad
 jacek: in oware?
 MSmits: with ucb1, you can pick 1 parameter to act as independent, preferably the most important one
 MSmits: you never change that one
 MSmits: exploration parameter makes sense for this
 hacker535646: okay
 MSmits: you have this degree of freedom, because if you multiply all parameters by the same value, your bot stays the same
 struct: I see
 MSmits: so you might as well pick 1 value you never change
 jacek: like you make pawn score fixed
 MSmits: this assumes your eval is linear
 MSmits: yeah
 hacker535646: hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
 jacek: good evening
 hacker535646: yea
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII has been pwned by NNs, smh</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I have a theory about my random value addition problem
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: uttt is super sensitive to calculation time, if you double it, you get like 10-15% WR 
 MSmits: so that means that if you have more calc time, the average value will probably change a little bit, so you can detect stuff that happens at great depth
 MSmits: these will only be tiny little changes in node value
 MSmits: but enough so 1 node that is bad, goes below a good node
 MSmits: in early game that is
 MSmits: so i am screwing this up majorly by adding +0.01
 MSmits: i think i should probably just have 10 different bots with different calc time instead of adding random
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I know nothing... but couldn't you flip a param like 1-p and run it like a binomial.  ok I'll shutup
 MSmits: the problem is that my testbot doesnt have params
 MSmits: it's just mcts, all it has is an exploration param
 jacek: add some randomness in ucb
 Astrobytes: don't flip that
 Astrobytes: (c that is)
 MSmits: so that it explores differently jacek?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: hmm might be good
 jacek: i have random[0.9; 1.1] * eval + exploration
 Astrobytes: where were you adding the random before MSmits?
 struct: i think the was adding on node.score = eval * rand()
 MSmits: final move selection
 Astrobytes: ahhh
 MSmits: it makes it horribly bad
 Astrobytes: no that doesn't seem a good idea
 MSmits: even if only 0.01
 jacek: struct only in selection, no randomness in nodes
 struct: yeah
 struct: only on ucbn
 struct: ucb1
 MSmits:  i will try that then
 MSmits: jacek, choosing child with most visits is still safe right?
 MSmits: the random bonus or penalty should average out
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: ok
 jacek: i chose visits + score, but its mostly a hack for solved nodes
 jacek: instead of using ifs
 jacek: score + log(visits+3)
 MSmits: i usually do value, but i read somewhere visits is better for low calc time
 jacek: youre more confident about them
 MSmits: yeah, if you do value, you risk picking a node that hasnt been explored much, maybe it started going up in value right at the end
 jacek: what i do i interpret is that you choose most visited nodes unless better node is order of magnitude better than visits done
 jacek: somewhat like lower confidence bound
 MSmits: well... i did a test just now
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: my ucb with random lost 32 in a row
 MSmits: 36 now
 jacek: ready for production then
 MSmits: float adjustedWins = wins * (0.9f + float(FastRand(200)) / float(1000));
 MSmits: this is right?
 jacek: sounds right
 jacek: but really its weird
 MSmits: hmm yes it's weird
 jacek: yours 0.01 shouldnt have that impact either
 MSmits: maybe uttt is just different
 struct: maybe because its slower
 struct: i lose like 25% of rollouts if I do that on c4
 jacek: but you said rollouts count doesnt matter in c4
 struct: and it doesnt
 struct: but uttt might be different
 MSmits: it is
 MSmits: i tested it earlier
 MSmits: doubling calc time means 10-15% WR
 MSmits: +
 MSmits: this is why people obsess over simcount in uttt
 struct: maybe I should try to opimize mine
 struct: its kinda slow
 MSmits: i messed up something else though, i think it may not be the random. Even if i turn it off now, it loses
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: else if (bestPes &lt;= -1 &amp;&amp; value &gt; bestVisits)
 MSmits: i am comparing value with visits now in final move selection
 MSmits: so i think the ucb thing could work if i fix this
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: it works!
 MSmits: yay
 MSmits: no more overfitting
 MSmits: :cry: it wrecks my eval bot now
 MSmits: well thats what i asked for :P
 jacek: wrecks?
 struct: the non eval
 MSmits: 60%
 struct: wrecks the eval
 struct: its normal
 MSmits: so my mcts beats my eval bot
 struct: since it overfited
 MSmits: because it's no longer overfitted against
 MSmits: so now i can do serious fitting without worry
 MSmits: thanks to your + 0.2 rand

 Crosility: Okay.&#160;:), same. Technically not a dev by trade either. I assume most here are not. But that's also why I'm curious. If some try to keep consistency, or if they don't care, and just write stuff to the screen &amp; submit.
 Astrobytes: If I don't keep to some kind of standard I'll never be able to read others code of any other standard
 DomiKo: I follow google style guide
 Astrobytes: that's cause you're interning at google
 DomiKo: no
 DomiKo: I'm doing it for almost a year now
 Astrobytes: (it was a joke :P )
 Crosility: Thanks DomiKo, you just taught me that Google has a giant repository of Style guides for languages.
 DomiKo: yeah they have :D 
 Crosility: Didn't know they had their own.
 DomiKo: Astro ;P 
 Crosility: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html</a>And it's stupid-level comprehensive.
 DomiKo: it's good to have some doc with rules, so you won't change your own rules 
 DomiKo: there are some rules that you don't have to follow, like 80 chars line limit
 DomiKo: or 2 space indents 
 DomiKo: but overall it's great 
 Astrobytes: I actually recently converted to snake case, I'm not a fan of hungarian notation and I like my braces like I say. Indents must be tabs.
 Astrobytes: (tabs == 4 spaces)
 Astrobytes: (preferably)
 Crosility: Snake case?
 Astrobytes: I can work with anything though
 Astrobytes: snake_case
 Crosility: Aw, I see.
 Astrobytes: CamelCase
 Astrobytes: *camelCase better
 DomiKo: I found it really helpful to have camelCase for functions and snake_case for variables
 Crosility: I forget, but wasn't camelCase a function naming convention, snake_case for variables, and CAPS for static variables?
 Crosility: Hahaha, DomiKo .. said the same thing.
 DomiKo: and I have to say that after some work I might change from 4 spaces to 2 
 Crosility: Well, that reassures my thinking I guess.
 struct: I just write w/e, there is no rules here
 struct: 1 space indent 
 Crosility: DomiKo - 2 space tab?
 DomiKo: yes
 Crosility: Is that even .. a noticeable indent to be readable?
 DomiKo: about a week agou I would say no, but now I say yes
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: regarding camel and snake usage yes!
 struct: yes 2 indent is readable
 struct: you just need to get used to it
 struct: I still prefer 4
 DomiKo: anyone know how to play paper soccer? xd
 Astrobytes: I keep constants with either all CAPS or PascalCase and enums PascalCase
 struct: domiko i heard its a popular game in poland
 Astrobytes: lots of BFS
 DomiKo: yeah it is
 struct: ah how to play on what strategy to use
 struct: NN
 struct: when in doubt NN
 DomiKo: really???
 struct: no
 DomiKo: ehhh
 DomiKo: rule of thumb I see
 struct: Jacek must use minimax there
 Astrobytes: jacek used some modified BFS stuff at least as an example
 Astrobytes: you'll never get a straight answer unless you play it though
 DomiKo: making sim for that seems hard
 struct: BT is your NN will shine
 struct: is where your*
 Astrobytes: indeed DomiKo
 Crosility: So, with formatting. I do this a lot in the puzzles, but would never do in my own programs. - Does anyone else do this&#160;: 
 Crosility: int H, W; scanf("%d%d", &amp;H, &amp;W); fgetc(stdin);
 DomiKo: I don't really want to train NN now&#160;:( it's so hot 
 Crosility: They will condense the initialize, and scan to one line, if it's just a couple variables.
 DomiKo: I never mix C with C++
 Crosility: (Well, I'm a C programmer primarily)
 DomiKo: ohhh right
 Astrobytes: "never mix C with C++" - CG says otherwise
 Crosility: But I find most puzzles, I start them, and the first thing I do is half the number of lines of code I'm given.
 DomiKo: :scream:
 Astrobytes: come on, half our C++ bots are basically C
 Astrobytes: with c++ parts for convenience.
 k4ng0u: you guys never use the std lib?
 Crosility: Haha, C logic is easier to read.
 DomiKo: I use the std:: lib
 Astrobytes: careful with that
 k4ng0u: I was hopting you say otherwise, could have blamed my performance issues on that :p
 DomiKo: :joy:
 Astrobytes: I don't in sim/search based code
 Astrobytes: if speed is an issue
 DomiKo: yeah true
 Astrobytes: otherwise with the pragmas and whatnot it's fine
 Astrobytes: just don't go resizing vectors on the fly etc
 k4ng0u: I usually use a GameState class and vector/array without pointers. could be the problem as everything is copied for each node. But I feel like it would just be a nightmare to code otherwise
 DomiKo: there is a good rule for any language: you can only allocate memory in the first turn, and you will be fine
 Astrobytes: ^ exactly
 Astrobytes: k4ng0u yeah for a lot of things that works fine
 struct: even reserving memory for vectors helps a lot
 Astrobytes: but if perf really matters it's better to think clever
 Astrobytes: yeah struct
 Astrobytes: reserve more than you need if you think it might change, otherwise just reserve the max. DON'T change it during runtime
 DomiKo: mostly it's not only the CG things, if you want performance you need to know that memory is BIG problem
 Astrobytes: true, caching etc
 struct: this is why mcts is slow
 DomiKo: boys 
 DomiKo: Mean Max, Cyborg Uprising, Galleon Wars, Code4Life or Code a la Mode?
 DomiKo: I have to start something&#160;:( 
 BlaiseEbuth: No more memory! Alzheimer for computers!
 DomiKo: help me decide
 BlaiseEbuth: Cyborg +1
 Astrobytes: Cyborg or MM
 Astrobytes: C4L is boring, CalM was shit, Pirates is OK though
 struct: i have no idea how to make an AI for cyborgs
 struct: so I vote for cyborgs
 Astrobytes: (Galleon Wars == Pirates)
 DomiKo:&#160;:/
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the point. It's different
 struct: let me think again
 Astrobytes: Graph game!
 DomiKo: I know some papers about that game
 struct: Go mean max ill also compete
 DomiKo: really?
 DomiKo: 2 days contest?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah MM was fun
 struct: we can do cyborgs
 DomiKo: we can
 struct: your choice
 DomiKo: I have like a whole weekend for that
 struct: ok
 Astrobytes: I should improve my cyborgs and MM and Pirates
 BlaiseEbuth: Fight!
 DomiKo: because I don't want to go outside
 Astrobytes: hot eh?
 struct: why not?
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth takes :popcorn:</b>
 DomiKo: hot and I need to do some CG :D
 struct: if I win you must go outside
 Astrobytes: and film it
 struct: lol
 DomiKo: :confounded:
 Astrobytes: #DomiKoMelts
 Astrobytes: you could set up a gofundme afterwards for post-sun cream
 struct: its not that hot there
 Astrobytes: well it was 20C here and people were walking around with their tops off (men)
 struct: 25ºC vs 36ºC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 100F at 3:30pm here ... two hours ago
 struct: Way hotter here
 Astrobytes: I was kinda cold tbh
 struct: DomiKo ok, so which game do you want to do?
 DomiKo: but if I would go outside then I should go to mountains 
 Astrobytes: mountains &gt; most things anyway
 DomiKo: struct let's go with Cyborgs
 struct: you can do w/e, you don't even need to go outside if you don't want.
 struct: ok
 DomiKo: Astro kinda true
 Astrobytes: though I love the sea
 struct: Im bronze there I think
 DomiKo: i'm silver
 struct: but its pretty weak bot
 Astrobytes: Me too I think
 DomiKo: so I have a little head start
 struct: I never did graph puzzles
 struct: good luck for me
 Astrobytes: you're above me struct
 Astrobytes: Maybe I'll do some for fun over the weekend
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth is Cyborgs?

 Astrobytes: DomiKo: you doing topcoder marathon next week?
 struct: ghost in the cell
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh GiTC, love it
 DomiKo: I've never done topcoder
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII never said his bot is good tho</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: optim games are the ones we do
 Astrobytes: Once a month
 DomiKo: any link?
 Astrobytes: one sec
 Illedan: TC :raised_hands:
 Astrobytes: illedan, got the link handy?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges?bucket=openForRegistration&amp;tracks">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges?bucket=openForRegistration&amp;tracks</a>[DS]=true&amp;types[]=CH&amp;types[]=F2F
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: I don't do links
 k4ng0u: I'm interested by the "only allocate memory in the first turn". Does it mean that during the first turn you create enough objects so that each turn would never require more than that amount of node? If so guess it would require a rather light state structure (when I read people stating they can have 200k sim a turn) Or maybe do you have a recycle mechanism for unused nodes?
 struct: this link?
 Astrobytes: me neither :rofl:
 Illedan: I wait for euler
 Illedan: Yes k4ng0u
 struct: k4ng0u for example when i use MCTS I allocate 40M nodes on first turn
 Astrobytes: Yeah. You can reuse+overwrite sometimes, depends on the algorithm
 DomiKo: just allocate around 600MB of memory and here you go
 struct: and i make it static so i still have 1 sec on the turn
 struct: I dont know how it works tbh
 struct: but it does
 k4ng0u: :O what is the memory limitation of CG again?
 DomiKo: struct what is this
 DomiKo: 768MB???
 DomiKo: something around it
 Astrobytes: 768mb
 struct: 768 is the limit
 DomiKo: I knew it!!!!
 struct: my nodes are 16bytes
 DomiKo: first guess lol
 struct: on C4 I allocate 45
 Astrobytes: sometimes you need to be smart about packing
 struct: domiko did you copy the entire link?
 Astrobytes: othertimes not so much, but it's better to have more
 DomiKo: yes
 struct: its future competitions on topcoder and ongoing I guess
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/">https://clist.by/</a>
 struct: marathon starts on 13-07
 struct: which should be optimization I guess?
 DomiKo: I don't see a contest from topcoder at 13-07
 Astrobytes: yeah. Click on the '15' on that to see the whole list
 k4ng0u: oh well I would have though that the look up for nodes would slow down the app more than creating them. 40M seems really a lot, and cache miss could happen very often, but I guess I was wrong xD
 DomiKo: ohh found it
 struct: i get cache misses but you either get cache misses on mcts or run out of nodes
 Astrobytes: wait til you see the topcoder website
 struct: or use a NN
 struct: and maybe it will fit
 Astrobytes: k4ng0u: any memory allocation/deallocation is very expensive on CG
 BlaiseEbuth: topcoder website :scream:
 Astrobytes: k4ng0u: you do java right? Check out some of wala's posts in the forum
 Astrobytes: regarding memory allocation/gc etc
 k4ng0u: I usually code in C++ on CG&#160;:) but my knowledge is very limited
 Astrobytes: Right. In that case: never allocate memory past first turn. Ever.
 k4ng0u: I don't even know how to compile C++ code haha
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: Click 'build' ezpz
 Astrobytes: F6
 DomiKo:  make
 k4ng0u: you guys have an C++ editor?&#160;;)
 DomiKo: VSCode ofc
 Astrobytes: VS build all is F6
 Astrobytes: but my F6 key broke
 BlaiseEbuth: Spam submit doesn't work in vscode Astrobytes
 struct: I use VS
 k4ng0u: very interesting, for now I am just not using new, still times faster than java/js (which are my main languages)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: getting my projects and directories always screws me up ... oh that's eclipse
 Astrobytes: VS not VSC BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Same
 Astrobytes: Visual Studio that is
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: Please tell me you don't use eclipse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for Java, yes I have ... I think I needed Beans at the time
 Astrobytes: Argh.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: VS for C ofc
 a-Rye: My favorite is Sublime, but I just like the pretty colors. Depends on the language though...Python I use vim and a Kali Linux box, Java I use Eclipse, JavaScript I use codepen. I used VS for the first time in a long time the other day for an interview lol
 k4ng0u: PatrickMcGinnisll use intellij for java, much better than eclipse&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I had to use what was it called... netbeans? once, that was better than eclipse but IDEA is nice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh I have that ... I do mobile apps on it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ intelliJ
 Astrobytes: hi a-Rye! I like Sublime for general quick editing of anything and used to use it a lot. these days not so much, just me
 BlaiseEbuth: jetbrains stuff is good. Sad only the bad languages suites are free...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: as i remember there's a few different eclipse builds, I think it's called Luna. Obviously i haven't used it in awhile
 Astrobytes: wellll, y'know, as long as you're productive in whatever you use it's cool
 k4ng0u: Intellij handles java/js/ts quite well (I think they have PyCharm as well for python) but it will always depend on how you code, some people are just very good at remembering the code base and vim is faster for them than the IDEs
 Astrobytes: ^ my point exactly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: VS Code, hmm... might have to try
 PatrickMcGinnisII: support for php ha ha&#160;;)
 DomiKo: a lot of people use VSC
 DomiKo: and companies
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well if it has less overhead that the regular VS... hmm
 k4ng0u: vsc is fine but not that polished, it's really good at text search, but regarding autocompletion, link to package, I feel it's a bit weak (maybe too multi purpose)
 Astrobytes: yeah the linking is messed up
 Astrobytes: it's nice though, don't get me wrong.
 k4ng0u: it's nice AND free
 Astrobytes: anyway. Time for beers and no code.
 Astrobytes: Indeed it is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Cannot GET /%7Bversion%7D/win32-x64/stable

 MSmits: you mean all nodes?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: complete
 struct: yes

 struct: :thumbsup:
 struct: I just learned what an adjacent matrix is
 struct: I guess ill use it for cyborgs
 MSmits: the you know more than i do
 struct: adjacency* 
 struct: im sure you know what it is MSmits
 struct: maybe just dont know the name
 MSmits: thats possible
 struct: I never was into graph problems
 struct: because I have no idea what tod o
 MSmits: i only really know them in the context of pathfinding and tree search and maybe a few other problems i ran into
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits got up to rank 1 wood3 in CTTT w/ 1 depth.  now to minmax the darn thing
 MSmits: gj
 struct: are you going to use the draw thing patrick?
 struct: play draw until you find a win?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did up til turn 89 ... seems like last 11 moves is the pivot
 struct: minmax might even be better to solve than mcts solver for cttt
 MSmits: i think i did minimax
 PatrickMcGinnisII: simple eval didn't get me over boss, smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: boss 20.93 me 19.18
 PatrickMcGinnisII: better than what i had, i was doing random b4
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 struct: I try  to avoid games with bosses now
 MSmits: why?
 struct: ptsd from last contest
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: im joking :p
 struct: sry MSmits
 MSmits: lol
 struct: its still so hot
 struct: Must be around 30º outside
 MSmits: i cant get my *best*  bot to provide sufficient challenge to eval bot&#160;:(
 struct: wdym?
 MSmits: i gave it 500 ms turns and it still lost to my 70 ms turn evalbot
 struct: I can give you my bot if you want
 MSmits: somehow it is still overfitted
 struct: but you will probably destroy it aswell
 MSmits: my evalbot wrecks it yeah
 struct: it wrecks mine too?
 MSmits: yes
 struct: ok so there is no point I guess
 MSmits: you are now rank 18
 struct: I just need to resubmit
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: Only bt leaderboard is fully gone
 struct: hard to recover it
 MSmits: evalbot is rank 9 now
 MSmits: pretty much same as mcts bot
 struct: wow
 MSmits: bot locally mcts bot gets obliterated
 MSmits: but
 struct: cant you play against eval and add rand to it aswell?
 struct: or it wont work?
 MSmits: i think it will work for a little while, but it will overfit
 MSmits: i think i need to ga it
 MSmits: have a whole population of different bots
 struct: I have something similar on bt
 struct: everytime I build on VS it copies the bot and saves it renames it date and time
 struct: renames it to date and time*
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>
 MSmits: this is evalbot
 struct: good w/r vs karliso
 struct: so you pretty much beat every1 except stronger evals
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, didnt notice, it is only a few games though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: recurse on the crack 
 MSmits: yeah i suspect it is 8x the same game as p1 and 8x the same game as p2
 MSmits: two deterministic bots
 struct: ah
 struct: maybe I should add rand to my select
 MSmits: didnt check though
 struct: to avoid you
 struct: :D
 MSmits: possibly&#160;:)
 MSmits: considering this bot is still very poorly fitted, i should be able to do better
 struct: did you fit everything by hand?
 MSmits: i barely fitted anything, a few by hand, the rest just guesses
 struct: i would have no idea what to eval there tbh
 struct: even worse than breakthrough
 MSmits: well you eval what makes you win
 MSmits: have some kind of calculation that represents the chance to get 3 in a row on the mainboard
 struct: ok miniboards, probably eval miniboards that will give me a free move
 MSmits: how do you mean
 struct: oh its not really possible
 struct: since you dont know if you will play there
 struct: the opponent will play*
 MSmits: no, you just look at the current state
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: i dont even do anything with the next board to play on
 struct: still maybe you can give a score that if the opponent plays there you get a free move
 MSmits: i just look at whats currently on the board
 MSmits: ah yeah i have something with that
 MSmits: dont know if it works well
 MSmits: barely changed param
 struct: if you ever do a NN I guess you can use this eval to help at the start
 MSmits: you mean to kick off supervised?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: yeah jacek did that
 MSmits: I guess i did prove eval totally works on uttt
 MSmits: not just with nn's
 struct: would it be a good idea to give minimax eval to start supervised?
 struct: Like give the eval that the state would be in 6 plies 
 MSmits: yeah i think jacek did that on bt
 struct: yeah top 10 is impressive
 struct: Ok I have jacek ideas
 struct: now I just need jacek skill
 MSmits: he took his time to learn
 struct: ofc
 MSmits: i think you just need his determination
 struct: yesterday i found something for mcts selection on NNs
 MSmits: you're skilled enough as a coder
 struct: I dont know if its any good but I shared it with him anyways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what is faster? (x-2)&gt;&gt;1 or (x==2?0:1) ... if x can only be 2 or 4
 MSmits: oh the ucb formulas?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eprints.fri.uni-lj.si/4033/1/Vodopivec.pdf">http://eprints.fri.uni-lj.si/4033/1/Vodopivec.pdf</a>
 struct: check page 117
 struct: its win rate vs UCB
 MSmits: branching is usuall slow PatrickMcGinnisII
 struct: basicly it makes it play better with lower rollouts
 struct: since I dont think they dont do many rollouts here it could help
 struct: The author calls it Sarsa-UCT
 struct: Never heard of it before
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, I need to eat ... x&gt;&gt;2 would be fine
 struct: But the win rate seemed interesting enough
 MSmits: good stuff struct
 MSmits: these improved formulas work when  their calculation cost don't dominate the overall performance
 struct: yeah
 struct: I think ja fica uses Thompson sampling + UCB
 struct: or something like that
 struct: for C4
 MSmits: yeah i remember
 Darkcodi: Can I turn off "shortest" clash of code?My language is C# and it's quite verbose. I can't compete with JS/Python in terms of "short code" (at least until Codingame adds support of .NET6's top-level statements)
 Darleanow: hello, does the block the spreading fire counts as a contest&#160;?
 Darleanow: did*
 Inferno_dragon: yep
 Inferno_dragon: i will give you some point
 Inferno_dragon: some codepoint
 Inferno_dragon: some how the velocity could not play with the search race, Illedan puzzle cool
 AdeelAtta: join clash
 Inferno_dragon: really
 prof.choi: Join Clash
 Inferno_dragon: deebidap
 Darleanow: because i didnt get the sucess from the ranking etc
 Thorcode: cuz the base of block the spreading fire just 1390 what do you expect dude
 Thorcode: *1910
 eulerscheZahl: i still see green circle as the most recent one giving up to 10000 points
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if it will get updated or the optim doesn't count
 Darleanow: u didn't understood Thorcode
 Thorcode: the max you can have is 1910 code point
 Thorcode: and you need code point to rank up
 Darleanow: it's still not what i'm asking for&#160;:)
 Darleanow: you have ranking success&#160;!
 Darleanow: mb, achievements
 Thorcode: and also the block the spreading fire not a contest
 Darleanow: oh&#160;!
 Darleanow: yeah that was my question
 Darleanow: thanks&#160;!&#160;:)
 Darleanow: if i'm right those are just puzzles 
 Thorcode: I feel kinda miss when i didn't pay attention at the green circle
 Darleanow: euler, do you know the frequency of contests&#160;?
 Thorcode: that is optimization you can earn some code point
 Darleanow: yeah i've seen 
 Darleanow: i don't really care of the ranking x)
 Darleanow: i'm an achievements farmer 
 Thorcode: I just care about ranking
 Darleanow: if i remeber correctly
 Darleanow: you can get 1k cg points
 Darleanow: with each puzzle of code optim
 Darleanow: its your 5 best languages
 Darleanow: and you should do more challenges&#160;:)
 Thorcode: that the code golf dude
 Darleanow: f
 Darleanow: i'm a bit tired mb
 Thorcode: geez how the hell the search race suck i almost get the half rank and the point i earn only 7
 Darleanow: xD
 Darleanow: it's weird formulas
 Thorcode: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: "euler, do you know the frequency of contests&#160;?"no

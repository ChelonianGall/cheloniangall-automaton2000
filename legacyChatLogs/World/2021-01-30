 jacek: its for students only
 NobodyGuy: yeah, we are old man
 Aayush.Curious: @jacek yeah...wait arent we all learners tho?
 eulerscheZahl: "Any high school student, undergraduate student, or graduate student age 16+ can participate!"
 eulerscheZahl: we are old, that excludes most of us regular users from the contest
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday jacek
 Aayush.Curious: Wait...does it really say only high school student or undergraduate?
 jacek: its in faq
 Aayush.Curious: oh yeah o saw it now..
 Aayush.Curious: Hmm...alright, but still just one seat is left in my team..
 Aayush.Curious: And at max, i can kick out a guy and amke a room for 2
 Aayush.Curious: make*
 Aayush.Curious: So, if anyone wants to come;

 Aayush.Curious: Besides; i have never been to these hackfest; neither any of my teammates have..
 Aayush.Curious: And although we are quite good in coding, we wanted someone experienced
 <b>**eulerscheZahl prefers a fixed problem set to solve over those wider hackathons where you have to bring your own ideas what to code</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: something is wrong with Tryangle catch. It doesn't show the tags :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: I think I know why. The 5% doesn't parse :rofl:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/5%">https://www.codingame.com/learn/5%</a>
 Aayush.Curious: So...I guess i am not finding anyone. for my team from here
 Aayush.Curious: Alright..
 eulerscheZahl: go to CG discord, there's an #external-contests channel
 PRATIK-CHOLKE: Hello 
 eulerscheZahl: post it there: link to the contest, that it's for students only and that you want 1 more player
 Aayush.Curious: @euler yeah CG discord..
 Aayush.Curious: @euler thank u GOD!!
 jacek: oO
 Aayush.Curious: DAMN I loved 2048 puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: nice to hear&#160;;)
 Aayush.Curious: 2048 was one of the best puzzles; tbh and your coding skills make u seem like GOD...LOL
 eulerscheZahl: let's not put that too hich&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: high
 eulerscheZahl: so, should I file a bug report that CG doesn't support a 5% tag?What are my chances that CG considers this tag relevant enough to dig into it?
 dbf: where this tag is not supported? It suggests to practice it together with Disappointment in the title of your game&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/xusu5s">https://prnt.sc/xusu5s</a>
 dbf: ah, ok
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/xusuyc">https://prnt.sc/xusuyc</a>
 eulerscheZahl: where do you see the tag in use?
 dbf: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://c2n.me/4aKOXod">https://c2n.me/4aKOXod</a>
 dbf: it is a link preview generated from title
 eulerscheZahl: ah. where do you even see that preview? it's not on the forum announcement
 dbf: it is from message in telegram
 TBali: this tag does not relevant for 95% of the users, sorry&#160;:-)
 TBali: go for "5-percent" 
 TBali: does = is
 eulerscheZahl: 5% not supported, oh the irony :D
 jacek: euler is master in disappointment
 TBali: minority ombudsmanf for coders migght help, petition him
 TBali: my mistype ratio is even higher than usual today
 eulerscheZahl: a few more and you don't even need encryption anymore
 TBali: is there a webchat plugin wich redirects the enter key to a "are you sure?" popup?
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather see an edit function
 Tenty2k: sup dudes
 Tenty2k: how do you lower the level of difficulty for clashes&#160;?
 Tenty2k: if that is even an option
 eulerscheZahl: it's random
 dbf: there are random tasks in clashes, you can't modify difficulty
 eulerscheZahl: for private clashes you can choose the mode and i think even language (don't quote me on the latter)
 eulerscheZahl: for public ones you have no influence at all
 TBali: and clash difficulty is even more subjective than for solo puzzles
 TBali: I remeber starring at a reverse puzzle input for 15 mins than it turned out to be very simple
 TBali: reverse puzzles are like iq tests. Find the pattern. Luckily I have a negative test result for IQ&#160;:-) 
 TBali: good to have it in covid times
 lets_think: if 
 Astrobytes: Hmm, what to practice today... AI? Or disappointment? :thinking:
 zhoubou: Practice 5%
 Astrobytes: Good point!
 zhoubou:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: disappointment is a valuable lesson for life
 Astrobytes: I'm a natural pessimist, I'm seldom disappointed&#160;;)
 TheMusicalSkull_348b: Hello
 jacek: someone completed puzzle of the week :tada:
 selmaDa: hi
 Rockstar555: hii
 Rockstar555: noo
 Rockstar555: @jacek
 XxX__Neatrix__XxX: hii
 jacek: oO
 Rockstar555: hey jacek
 jacek: how may i help you, Sir/Madam
 Rockstar555: i am sir
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Rockstar555: so i want to say some confusion with hard puzzles
 SPDene: rockstar555 have you tried using nested octal loops to adjust the lapizoidal cooefficients of the keywords?
 Astrobytes: Try nicely using your brain to constrate.
 Rockstar555: yeah
 SPDene: oh wait... you want to *say* confusion, not get it :P
 Rockstar555: thanks
 Rockstar555: SPDene is a brave guys i like his opinion
 Westicles: Can someone edit this to private?  It is orphan clutter now

 eulerscheZahl: not possible to edit the approval status if you aren't the creator
 eulerscheZahl: 6 more days and it's gone anyways
 Westicles: If CG is deleting approvals they can delete this
 Westicles: Help reduce the logjam
 SPDene: IMO best way to do that would be remove the quest map incentive to submit stuff&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: contrib page is messy enough, one more or less doesn't matter
 eulerscheZahl: i totally agree with SPDenequality &gt; quantity
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is in the top10 of most active contributors on CG</b></p><p><img src="/a/45804347289477" /> SPDene: I think eulerscheZahl's a bot tbh :P
 Rockstar555: nice
 Rockstar555: eulerscheZahl is a great Coder
 Rockstar555: or contributor
 Astrobytes: Yes, the contribution quest is a complete and utter trainwreck.
 eulerscheZahl: or maybe i just buy new contributions on fiverr
 Astrobytes: haha
 Rockstar555: :smile:
 Rockstar555: i am fully agree with Astrobytes
 Westicles: What's after top 1000 CoC?  I guess I will inevitably do those someday
 eulerscheZahl: 3 wins in a row
 Astrobytes: I'm happy to miss that part of the quest map.
 Rockstar555: i think 1000 CoC u don't play CoC Westicles
 Rockstar555: okk
 Rockstar555: :smile:
 Westicles: Hey Rockstar. Yeah, maybe I will play 300 to be able to edit
 Rockstar555: okk
 Rockstar555: nice
 Rockstar555: how i can make a multiplayer game guys
 jacek: you mean bot for multiplayer game?
 TBali: just solved Kakuro solver. Timeout for IDE test 08, but passing all validators. Probably 'close call'
 TBali: Hah, now my brute force skill increased by 1
 TBali: but backtracking is not really brute force
 TBali: it is clever force
 314Mat: cunning + 1lvl
 Westicles: they are going to have to rename CG to wacky japanese puzzle site
 TBali: They are fine in my book
 Westicles: Nurikabe is a nice one
 TBali: That is still on my todo list
 TBali: I don't know how to speed up Kakura - I already do it O(x * y), no necessary extra loops for checking sums
 TBali: *un... necessary
 TBali: even fdigit reuse is checked via bitmasks
 TBali: okay, O(x,y) is silly, of course it is much more
 TBali: what I meant I do not make extra loops
 Rockstar555: yeah
 Rockstar555: sorry what are u saying jacek
 jacek: oh you meant contribution
 struct: hello
 TBali: revoke past message. Found a speedup idea in Kikaro
 eulerscheZahl: what's Kikaro?
 struct: new feature announced on monday? :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: yes, at least "maybe Monday"
 eulerscheZahl: *might
 bottlez: Always share your code :innocent:
 TBali: Kakuro
 TBali: just encrypted&#160;:-)
 TBali: ny mistyping

 eulerscheZahl: in theory every problem in project euler should be solvable in less than 1 minute on a slow machine
 eulerscheZahl: my solver took a little longer, maybe 15min
 TBali: any relation to the projecteuler site, or just a coincidence?
 eulerscheZahl: my nickname? i needed one when i registered there and just kept it
 eulerscheZahl: me being creative and such...
 TBali: I just registered, looks interesting.750 problems.... Ah another time sink...
 Westicles: They get extremely boring and repetitive
 DomiKo: yes
 kovi: i am starting to loose faith in my uttt solution-yesterday was lucky, avg. place is between 20-40 as i thought, but its ok-i've added mcts solver...no difference (leaderboard)-earlier recogniton of some wins: it became much worse
 MSmits: a small improvement will not be noticable in uttt by submitting
 MSmits: you need a better test to notice this
 DomiKo: but solver?
 MSmits: solver is definitely an improvement
 kovi: im more concerned about the 2nd part
 DomiKo: kovi have you stats version with solver vs without solver?
 MSmits: what is the 2nd part
 kovi: earlier recognition of non3inawrow wins
 MSmits: how did you do this?
 MSmits: you counted won boards and if you won 4, with 2 drawn boards, it's a win because opponent can get max 3?
 kovi: (domiko - havent started to play locally. also self play can be misleading with strong heuristics. altough solver should show up for sure)
 kovi: yeah, msmits something like that
 MSmits: that's never going to be worse, unless it takes a lot of resources
 MSmits: i made it part of a lookup, so it gave me no extra overhead, it was in the same lookup i always used
 kovi: im surprised. maybe i start to work towards a more tentative goal
 kovi: yes, same lookup for me as well
 MSmits: you could have a bug in it
 MSmits: it's something you can easily do wrong
 MSmits: if you dont hardcode your bot and it's sufficiently random in move selection (maybe add random(0, 0.05) to each child value on top level)
 MSmits: then self testing is fine
 MSmits: a small random variation will not make your bot much weaker
 MSmits: and it will make it much more random
 MSmits: then you can really test the value of some heuristics properly
 kovi: yes, only counterheuristic is misleading
 MSmits: my ept bots are really deterministic, so i have no choice but to add this randomness. Otherwise every test will be useless
 MSmits: especially since at least half of opponents are deterministic like that. You will end up playing the same game over and over =/
 MSmits: uttt is thankfully quite different though, as long as players arent hardcoding
 kovi: cant be sure that i dont have a bug, but already doublechecked.anyway i got a new theory. it is not that my moves are towards are more tentaive win. it is avoiding a loss, which the enemy may not detects that early
 MSmits: are you saying, you're worse off playing better?
 MSmits: that is actually a thing
 Angecide: I feel the same, whenever I add heuristics, my bot just becomes worse
 kovi: i have an idea how the check that
 MSmits: Angecide uttt is notorious like that
 MSmits: if something helps, it helps by a little
 MSmits: so do also make sure it is actually worse, and you dont go by your submit result, because that is fairly useless
 kovi: 3 submits as always (atm im yesterdays version)
 MSmits: yes, but that doesnt necessarily make it a good test
 MSmits: it depends a lot which players you face and in which order you face them
 Angecide: I am starting to incorporate cgbench to get more “true” data of my bot’s performance
 MSmits: yeah... best thing is make a list of target players with your arena version in there as well. So you play vs yourself and a selection of players, preferably spread out on the leaderboard
 MSmits: dont include players you always beat or players that always beat you
 Angecide: ye, I am new to cgbench, for uttt should I set randomSeet: true, empty seed list and playerPosition: -2&#160;?
 MSmits: seed has no effect on uttt
 MSmits: playerposition -2 is good, that makes it alternate
 Angecide: yep I see
 MSmits: though you could also choose to have a separate player 1 and player 2 test
 MSmits: that's sometimes interesting
 Angecide: ah right, that way I can measure the performance of each of my sides more accurately 
 MSmits: yeah, you could do that
 MSmits: I did that vs karlis o. Last time i checked, without book it was 100% win for him if he was p1, 50% if he was p2
 MSmits: so he's pretty strong&#160;:)
 Angecide: I mean he does book too right?
 MSmits: not anymore
 MSmits: it was hurting him
 Angecide: oh, so he has a sick bot, that's actually cool
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: re curse as well i assume, judging by the rating
 kovi: oh, #1 now?
 MSmits: those two should not be too far apart in strength i think
 kovi: did i pushed him?
 MSmits: who? karlis o?
 kovi: yes
 Angecide: nah, kovi that is because u are boosting karliso
 Angecide: check replays
 MSmits: you may have. It's a very reliable bot
 MSmits: so it wins easily against all weaker players
 MSmits: might be re curse nn was either unlucky or has rare losses against weaker players, i didnt check
 kovi: both of them beat me+angecide 100%
 kovi: maybe just at a different height
 MSmits: also just maybe not the same amount of them
 Angecide: ye, that's werid, recurse should stay nr1 according to what I can see 
 MSmits: no, the one who wins more gets boosted more
 kovi: they were within 0.1 ts few days ago
 MSmits: opponent selection is random so it may just mean karliso played more games
 MSmits: and since he was a lower rank, he's closer to your rank so probability of a match is higher
 MSmits: makes sense to me
 kovi: yes he won more
 MSmits: only fix for that is for recurse to resubmit
 MSmits: and then do it again in a few days if you guys keep submitting&#160;:)
 MSmits: unless of course his bot is perfect vs, then you should push him right back to 1
 MSmits: vs you
 MSmits: btw jacek, my connect4 bot has problems with you. I pushed you quite a bit past tric trac
 MSmits: maybe it's somehow connected to the fact that i changed my steal and opening to move 1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Just did "The lost files", reminds me a little bit of euler's TryAngleCatch graph
 eulerscheZahl: i had the same impression when I saw that puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: but the lost file is only 5 months old
 MSmits: I spent some time writing classes to read the input properly euler. But havent gotten to the logic yet. Working on GoD first
 eulerscheZahl: =&gt; my game is older =&gt; i didn't get any inspiration from there
 MSmits: i think the idea of having objectives and such, might be similar to a good approach with tryangle
 eulerscheZahl: no pressure MSmits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Your game just went live yesterday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there was only 2 approvals, then i saw it pop up, only had 2 days left
 eulerscheZahl: but i started working on that game in June
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I understand
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did puzzle to get some insight into finding triangles
 MSmits: but you get them as input dont you?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/TryAngle-Catch/graphs/contributors">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/TryAngle-Catch/graphs/contributors</a>took me a while to code the game the way I wanted
 kovi: im lazy and asked euler to list the triangles&#160;;)
 MSmits: well i am happy he did. Finding them seems messy
 eulerscheZahl: it is :D
 eulerscheZahl: checking for crossing lines
 MSmits: well i guess you find neighbors and then for each neighbor find out if one of it's neighbors is a neighbor of the root
 MSmits: but then its not necessarily a triangle ofc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: holy crap, it is in the input
 eulerscheZahl: map generator is a little worse even. making sure that the angles don't get so small that houses are on a line visually
 MSmits: oh, right
 MSmits: that must have been annoying to code
 MSmits: at least it's easy to debug, since you're making it visual
 MSmits: when i write a bot, nothing is visual
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I saw some obtuse angle testing... i didn't dive into referee at all tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the shading of the triangle is a nice touch
 eulerscheZahl: the obtuse angle is for visuals only
 eulerscheZahl: the referee makes sure that you can't construct triangles with such angles at all in the node placement
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :thumbsup_tone1:  The mirroring musta been a pain in the arse
 eulerscheZahl: no, not even that much
 eulerscheZahl: but command handling
 kovi: you start from center?
 eulerscheZahl: i place a random node + mirrored at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: make sure there are no obtuse angles
 eulerscheZahl: then connect all nodes within 400 range at first
 eulerscheZahl: then remove random edges and see if the graph is still double connected
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I wrote 100 lines trying to setup game like GiTC, and it seems like overkill at this point, smh
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII slaps PatrickMcGinnisII around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: the first boss has 200 lines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap gotta do real work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: thanks for another game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :P
 1400179: MSmits: I'm not fighting leaderboard in uttt anymore, CG system is so broken I'd have to resubmit all the time to account for random draws and whatnot. My bench gives &gt;62% over 420 games in top5, it's enough for me. :p
 eulerscheZahl: a reasonable decision
 eulerscheZahl: and the 960 version of chess was too
 1400179: I don't think it's about books
 eulerscheZahl: so it's about the small difference in points even if you are significantly stronger?
 MSmits: I know reCurse
 1400179: Yeah
 MSmits: i was just responding to the other guys that were surprised karliso was boosted to 1
 1400179: Same problem in CSB
 MSmits: i think it's not about the small difference in points in this case
 MSmits: in this case it's about you and karliso both winning 100% against everyone else
 1400179: Which brings the gap to inexistant if enough lower ranked submits happen
 MSmits: exactly
 1400179: Which is the same problem as CSB
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: well i said everyone else, i mean mostly &lt; rank 10
 MSmits: other * wil* have occasional wins and draws
 MSmits: the game is random enough for that
 MSmits: not in CSB though, CSB is pretty dependable when you've got a stronger bot. But that doesnt help you with low ranked submits
 1400179: Except it's not
 MSmits: you dont win 100% vs other players?
 1400179: Barely got back rank 1 with &gt;80% winrate against everyone, took until the submit was around 90% done to get it.
 1400179: Which means 70% would not have made it
 MSmits: ah yes, i meant when you're on the board, over time
 MSmits: not during submit
 1400179: But the only one who could make a difference submitting is pb 4
 1400179: The others will just give 100% to both
 1400179: System is broken as hell&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, i meant, that is different with utt
 MSmits: there are more players that will make a difference
 MSmits: not just 1
 1400179: Seems like only kar liso too no?
 1400179: Or does he win that much more vs others?
 MSmits: nah, i didnt test, but even against karliso i would get wins as p1
 MSmits: it would just be draws and losses for me (draws counting as 2 games)
 MSmits: so if i chain submit
 MSmits: i will push whoever i play worse against
 MSmits: not just whoever i play more against
 1400179: True
 MSmits: karliso wins 97% vs me as p1, 50% as p2
 MSmits: dont know how it is with your bot
 1400179: I only have combined stats
 MSmits: well it's 74% or so for karliso
 MSmits: vs me
 1400179: 69%
 MSmits: this is only his last version btw, a few months ago i was basically tied with him
 MSmits: he improved a lot
 1400179: vs you
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: there is some residual book in there thats not hardcoded vs you, no idea if it helps at all
 MSmits: it was vs your last version
 MSmits: totally different bot
 MSmits: but there's also residual book vs an old karliso version
 MSmits: so who knows...
 1400179: If only we'd all be obsessed on a good game instead...
 MSmits: your definition of a good game is really quite limiting though
 1400179: MK was right all along
 1400179: :o
 MSmits: he says a  lot, so you'd have to be more precise&#160;:)
 1400179: CSB is the one true game
 MSmits: oh ok, well it's a good game in its own way. I dislike what it does with the floats though, same with GoD
 MSmits: the angles i thought it was mostly
 MSmits: illedan fixed that for br2t
 MSmits: br2k
 1400179: It really doesn't have much impact
 MSmits: not much no
 MSmits: it's an annoyance
 1400179: My new training run really draws a *lot* in checkers...
 MSmits: how does it draw
 MSmits: not by repetition i hope?
 1400179: Shuffling
 1400179: How do you make a replay shareable again...
 MSmits: do you have the endgame book yet? Because otherwise i dont think you can fix it
 MSmits: from CG bench i have no idea
 MSmits: havent succeeded
 1400179: No I haven't plugged the endbook yet
 1400179: I wanted to do a clean run with all the tweaks I did since
 MSmits: in the IDE you do replay and share button
 1400179: To """properly""" measure
 MSmits: ah ok
 1400179: As much as you can in this universe of entropy
 1400179: Source code is also messy as hell
 1400179: For the db
 MSmits: you mean from the link i shared?
 1400179: I just want to uncompress it straight into the ram and spare the drama
 1400179: Yes
 MSmits: it seemed messy to me
 MSmits: wait do you mean the db or the generator&#160;?
 1400179: The db
 MSmits: oh ok, i never tried to use the db
 MSmits: just the generator code
 1400179: I don't care if it takes 16gb at least the lookup is quick
 MSmits: yeah i made a 15 seed db for oware that's 4 GB. Different result based on how many turns left
 1400179: At least it's better than chinook's lol
 MSmits: so its 15 seed states times 200
 MSmits: whats bad about chinooks?
 1400179: The source code is ancient
 1400179: And it shows
 MSmits: oh ok, i didnt know it was public
 1400179: Well on the plus side I don't lose against db dr
 1400179: On the negative side it's all draws
 MSmits: do you think the top checker bots used engine code publicly shared?
 1400179: Always possible
 1400179: I don't know db dr's stance on that
 MSmits: dont think dbdr has a problem with it, I do think he googles when there is a multi. He probably would just use it for ideas and them make it his own
 1400179: Can you open this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/525568104">https://www.codingame.com/replay/525568104</a>
 struct: yes
 1400179: Ok so the trick is to add share- to replay
 MSmits: yeah
 1400179: so /share-replay/...
 MSmits: weird
 1400179: I think it's necessary since they made the replays private by default
 MSmits: so there's not actually anything changing in terms of security?
 1400179: Since the contest snooping I think
 1400179: Anyway that's an example of draw
 MSmits: yeah fairly typical
 MSmits: usually it's 3 vs 3 though, 
 MSmits: but 4v4 happens
 1400179: I wonder what the endgame db has to say about it
 MSmits: could be anything really, i wouldnt know
 MSmits: I worry that you will keep having this problem on the leaderboard
 struct: kings are not forced to take?
 MSmits: even if you can fix it offline
 1400179: They are
 struct: Ah, I thought it was another variant
 1400179: tbh I have my satisfaction with benches
 struct: where you could move kings like queens
 1400179: idc about what displays anymore and lost faith in any fix
 MSmits: i mean you will keep having draws because you can never fit an  endgame book large enough
 1400179: Well I'm hoping the training will prefer positions that won't draw
 1400179: If it has a 8 piece db
 1400179: Though uncompressed maybe only 6 or 7 would fit
 MSmits: yeah that's possibly
 MSmits: if it is dtm, then 7 piece is the maximum realistic
 1400179: Motherboard doesn't support more than 64gb&#160;:(
 MSmits: i dont think anyone ever did a 8 piece dtm
 MSmits: the calculation time would be insane
 1400179: In theory the NN could learn endgames
 1400179: But mine is probably way too small
 MSmits: the framework?
 1400179: No the network
 MSmits: the network i meant sry
 MSmits: you need more layers/nodes
 struct: lc0 end games are good?
 1400179: Yeah but in CG's context I can't
 struct: without table bases
 1400179: lc0 has syzygy
 MSmits: right
 struct: ah ok
 1400179: Don't think they care without, though someone trained an endgame net
 1400179: Not used in competitions
 MSmits: hey reCurse, remember when checkers was introduced and you said, pah why bother, it's a solved game
 1400179: Not sure how well it performs
 1400179: I say a lot of dumb things
 MSmits: just pointing this one out :P
 1400179: Thanks
 MSmits: :grin:
 1400179: To be honest though
 1400179: Without NN I wouldn't bother
 1400179: It's my only interest for these games
 1400179: That are way too studied
 MSmits: yeah that's fair
 1400179: Hmm...
 1400179: endgame net huh
 1400179: Now that's another idea
 struct: Seems worth a try
 1400179: There are a lot of interesting ideas there
 kovi: manual prevention of interaction till...x turns/fewer power
 1400179: I can just do straight up SL
 MSmits: i do wonder how chinook solves the problem of looking up a win and then not knowing how to get there quickly without repetition
 MSmits: they dont have dtm db
 1400179: For checkers it should be as simple as simplification I think
 1400179: Since you need to capture all to win
 1400179: Any win that has less pieces is better
 1400179: Maybe even add piece distance on top
 MSmits: yes, but many turns you have no capture opportunity
 MSmits: oh an average distance to capture value?
 1400179: Maybe
 MSmits: or something?
 1400179: Should be very easy to tune offline
 MSmits: yeah, if you have a good idea how to code it, I would struggle with that
 1400179: Just need to pick a random position from db and time to solve
 1400179: Tune heuristic to optimize
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: well you could add that to your nn instead you know
 1400179: Well that's why I was musing about endgame net
 MSmits: ah
 1400179: I can supervised learn the db
 1400179: Only issue is it doesn't give policy
 1400179: So DTM would definitely be better
 1400179: Do those exist online?
 MSmits: i keep finding the same google result for that, but it's dead, bought up by some advertising spam crap
 1400179: :cry:
 MSmits: someone built a 7 piece
 MSmits: checkers has really been dead since it was solved I think
 MSmits: the link i shared was the center of the checkers world i think
 MSmits: martin fierz
 MSmits: i would guess it's kind of annoying when your favorite game gets solved completely
 1400179: I guess
 MSmits: btw, it should not be hard for you generate the dtm yourself. I think you may be better at this than I am and  i was able to do it for oware. It's not that different for checkers
 MSmits: the only annoying part is turning a game state in an integer code. You need binomial stuff for that
 MSmits: it's all in the generator code
 1400179: It's not something I'm interested into enough to dedicate the time needed if I can avoid it
 MSmits: yeah I get that. I found it fun to do, but we have differing tastes
 1400179: For a competition I'd be down that path already
 MSmits: understandable
 1400179: Oh and something else
 1400179: I think I'm interested into checkers also because it's a stepping stone to chess
 1400179: And then I'll lose my soul there probably
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: is it really a stepping stone?
 1400179: I think so
 MSmits: are they so similar?
 MSmits: I mean they're both historically popular board games
 1400179: You have different piece types, you need to handle endgames, there are problems with shuffling
 MSmits: ah yes, thats right
 1400179: I think BT-&gt;checkers-&gt;chess is a path that makes a lot of sense
 Amloxg: :grinning:
 MSmits: yeah, I am trying to think of another game to add in there from CG, but can't think of one thats similar enough
 eulerscheZahl: where is arimaa on that list?
 1400179:&#160;?
 MSmits: arimaa not on CG, unless it's another one of your secret projects euler
 eulerscheZahl: nope, i have nothing in the making
 MSmits: kk
 1400179: "After DeepMind's&#160;AlphaZero &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero</a>&gt;&#160;mastered Go, Chess, and Shogi simply by playing itself, Omar Syed announced a $10,000 prize for the creation of such an Arimaa bot which could win a 10-game match against Sharp."
 1400179:&#160;!!
 Angecide: time to shine
 Angecide: or is it over?
 MSmits: that's a pretty big challenge though
 MSmits: if deepmind didnt claim it already...
 struct: Someone suggested arimaa before
 struct: But I think its too hard for cg
 eulerscheZahl: i think it was acat
 1400179: According to wikipedia it's not been done yet, but maybe it's not up to date
 MSmits: oh that game, with the animals
 struct: I think it expired
 MSmits: seemed hard yeah
 struct: It was until certain date
 struct: but im not sure
 1400179: Aww
 MSmits: you can try to do it anyway reCurse, the challenge might reappear
 MSmits: it's not like you're not already doing this for free
 struct: available annually until 2020
 struct: The prize was claimed in 2015, when a computer program played 7:2 against three human players.
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Arimaa">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Arimaa</a>
 1400179: Sometimes you need stupid carrots
 1400179: Nah there's different things I think
 1400179: "The Arimaa Challenge was a cash prize of around $10,000 that was to have been available annually until 2020 for the first computer program to win the human-versus-computer Arimaa challenge."
 1400179: And
 1400179: The quote I pasted
 struct: ah I  see now
 struct: its different
 1400179: Sharp is the program that won the first challenge
 1400179: So the second challenge is to beat Sharp
 1400179: Deepmind wouldn't claim it probably because training costs more than the prize money lol
 1400179: Those boards are unreadable though
 1400179: At least the pictures on wikipedia are ugh
 1400179: Anyway back to checkers
 tibithegreat: Q: maybe I'm dumb and can't see it, in ghost in the cell, can you output multiple actions in the same turn?
 1400179: Yes
 struct: reCurse you wanted dtw db?
 1400179: For checkers yes
 tibithegreat: how? a space between them?
 1400179:&#160;;
 struct: oh, I wonder if they only run on that program though
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://edgilbert.org/EnglishCheckers/KingsRowEnglish.htm">http://edgilbert.org/EnglishCheckers/KingsRowEnglish.htm</a>
 struct: at bottom there is dtw
 struct: But I guess its only for that program&#160;:/
 1400179: Hmm interesting, thanks
 1400179: Updated 2020 :o
 1400179: Oh I'm starting to pierce db dr's defenses

 1400179: Thanks
 struct: np
 1400179: Now to download this humongous file
 tibithegreat: reCurse: Apparently you can only do multiple actions at wood 2, I had just started and was in wood 3
 tibithegreat: that was confusing
 1400179: Oh didn't know, my bad
 tibithegreat: the statement was confusing as hell tho, cause it never said you can't do it
 tibithegreat: it did mention that you can do it in higher leagues (which I missed, my bad there)
 tibithegreat: but if you actually did it, it didn't err or anything, it only executed the first action
 1400179: Weird
 tibithegreat: anyway, moving on, climbing the wood ladder
 MSmits: hf tibithegreat, it's a nice game, i hope to revisit it at some point when i figure out a good approach for games like that. Doing game of drones atm that has similar problems
 struct: I also have no idea how to do those games
 MSmits: I'm guessing you have to use heuristics to form strategic objectives and then use some optimization algorithm to combine them efficiently
 MSmits: I think if I can figure out how to do that for one game, i can do it for many
 MSmits: pr2, gitc, god etc.
 MSmits: pms often speaking of "simulating ahead" under some assumptions
 MSmits: that would be a way to score objectives
 tibithegreat: yeah I did UTT before this, and this one seems quite different
 MSmits: it definitely is
 tibithegreat: I think a search can also be done at some point after you use a strategy/heuristic to prune a lot of the search space
 tibithegreat: I'll see
 MSmits: yeah that could work
 MSmits: I also think there is a large variety of approaches possible that all do fairly well
 MSmits: that's something complex games have in common
 MSmits: simple boardgames often don't have that variety
 tibithegreat: yeah
 tibithegreat: I'm not a big fan of this but it what it is
 MSmits: however, this does cause the rock/paper/scissors effect
 tibithegreat: I usually prefer games with simple rules but deep strategy
 MSmits: me too, but gitc does have fairly simple rules and looks pretty
 MSmits: it's just that you have so many options to send your dudes out
 tibithegreat: luckily I got some time to try stuff out, since I'm on medical leave from work for another week&#160;:)
 MSmits: good
 MSmits: well not good that you're sick or something :P
 tibithegreat: well I got the covid a week ago
 tibithegreat: until now it's been pretty mild, kinda like a cold
 MSmits: I see, well take it easy
 tibithegreat: thanks&#160;:)
 jacek: once again sf is going to win tcec super finals
 Arnaud.Net: @pb4 mdr ouais enfin la tu me mets 80% gg
 1400179: Last couple of days broke my heart&#160;:/
 jacek: hm
 jacek: reCurse whos gonna likely win in bt? p1 or p2? my previous bot prefered p1 but restaring train from scratch and now prefers p2...
 jacek: and its slightly stronger
 1400179: Mine said p1
 Scarfield: bt?
 jacek: breakthrough
 eulerscheZahl: too many games to keep track of acronyms
 Scarfield: ah of course
 eulerscheZahl: when I was new to CG, there were like 10 or 12
 jacek: right, sf
 eulerscheZahl: :older_man:
 jacek: youre getting old, ez
 MSmits: it would be really odd if p1 did not have an advantage in breakthrough
 MSmits: i mean the goal is to advance your pieces and you have 1 more turn to advance
 jacek: unless its blitzkrieg
 jacek: ahh wait not this
 MSmits: you mean zugzwang i think
 1400179: There could be zugzwang
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: those german words
 1400179: I had that problem when I misprogrammed the rules
 1400179: P2 had a massive advantage because of blockade
 1400179: White had to move and give away a hole
 jacek: in the beginning of training it always prefers p2, then switched to p1, and now finally its p2 again
 MSmits: this would not be detectable for a bot i think. The effect of zugzwang coming from p1 having 1 more move at the start would only be noticable if you nearly solved it I think. 
 1400179: Don't know why only if nearly solved
 MSmits: I am not sure it seems like a small effect, zugzwang itself is not, but there should be many ways to avoid it
 MSmits: unless both players play perfectly&#160;?
 1400179: There could be plenty of positions where you stumble on a zugzwang
 MSmits: yeah there could be, my intuition could be wrong here
 MSmits: in D&amp;B zugzwang is basically the entire game
 MSmits: btw jacek bt does have blitzkrieg :P
 MSmits: more so than zugzwang i think&#160;:)
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: it's basically moving fast and piercing enemy lines right
 jacek: ah
 MSmits: your connect4 bot is good btw
 MSmits: if you missed me saying it earlier
 MSmits: i almost never lose vs tric trac, lose quite a few vs you

 1400179: No
 MSmits: blind then, sry
 Scarfield: :v: how many fingers am i holding up
 eulerscheZahl: you have to extend your book
 MSmits: i just run mmcts without countering players specifically, it goes like 3-5 plies deep at most

 trictrac: struct&#160;: all works fine on Amazons :slight_smile:
 struct: Thanks for checking
 struct: its a simple game to make an engine I guess
 struct: without bitboards at least
 trictrac: huge branching factor&#160;: needs to prune
 trictrac: I made a bitboard version
 trictrac: @8x8
 struct: Should be the better version for CG
 trictrac: I think It's enough
 jacek: 2nd league will be 10x10 still?
 jacek: or just 8x8 both
 trictrac: I don't try the 10x10
 struct: 8x8 jacek
 struct: most likely
 bafian: i suck at math =(
 struct: Also dont worry on testing the 10x10
 struct: if the 8x8 doesnt have bugs the 10x10 wont have either
 struct: its the same code
 M3T4: such a grind to get to level 20what gives the most XP/time
 jacek: quest map?
 M3T4: quest and achievment includedi've already done the very hard puzzles that doesn't require too much code
 jacek: have you tried multiplayer games like CSB
 M3T4: i'm stuck on gold
 M3T4: just seen that  mars landers has 2 legendary achievments gonna do that one
 MSmits: M3T4 if you're stuck on csb gold it means you need to learn how to use search algorithms and csb is not the best place to start with that
 MSmits: better to start doing that on a simpler game, like one of the boardgames on cg
 M3T4: search algorithm&#160;? what do you mean 
 MSmits: by that i mean, you try out as many actions as you can, simulating them out into future turns to find out what is the best move
 struct: simulate next turns
 MSmits: often you would do 100k + simulations or something
 MSmits: really using the full calculation time available
 MSmits: but this is harder in csb as you have two  pods to control and need to make assumptions about the angles and thrust, discretizing them
 MSmits: and without a good evaluation function, it wont even let you reach checkpoints
 MSmits: board games are already discrete, dont have so many options and you can simulate quite a few turns into the future
 MSmits: also the simulation is easy usually
 M3T4: i was thinking i could use 1 bot as a defender and the other as a racer 
 MSmits: thats what we all do
 MSmits: not the hard part though
 struct: But you cant do this with ifs and elses
 M3T4: well i'm taking a totally wrong aproach then
 MSmits: no, it's not wrong
 MSmits: it's just less advanced. There's steps in learning this
 MSmits: nothing wrong with using heuristics to start with. That approach will even work all the way to nr 1 in some games
 MSmits: code a la mode contest was won by pure heuristics
 MSmits: if else etc.
 MSmits: I'm actually trying to use heuristics in game of drones atm, because i dont know how to use a search properly
 MSmits: (for this game)
 struct: I managed to implement the xorshift on avx2
 MSmits: oh
 struct: If you ever need it feel free to ask
 MSmits: do you mean multiple xorshifts at the same time in parallel?
 MSmits: or just 1 result?
 MSmits: fast
 struct: 8 at once
 MSmits: what would you do with 8 at once?
 MSmits: which game i mean?
 struct: Well I think it might be usefull on csb
 struct: oh wait
 struct: let me think
 MSmits: usually when i xorshift i hash stuff
 MSmits: do you mean fast random&#160;?&gt;
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: ahhh
 MSmits: yes that is very useful, would love to have that
 struct: but range is not high
 struct: range is 16 bits
 MSmits: fne with me
 struct: [0,665536-1]
 struct: something wrong there
 struct: remove 1 6 :p
 MSmits: weird
 struct: 2^16
 MSmits: right, but when i use fastrandom its usually to pick a random move
 MSmits: maybe out of 64 options max
 MSmits: why would i need 16 bit
 struct: Well if you use 8 bits you can do even more
 MSmits: that sounds great
 struct: The gain is around 300-400% on cg I think
 MSmits: nice
 struct: Let me see if I can do a 8 bit version
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: I would probably try to work it into uttt and other boardgames
 MSmits: I guess filling a randomcache right before a random rollout
 struct: so you use xorshift8bit&#160;?
 MSmits: you mean fastrandom again?
 struct: yes sorry
 MSmits: whatever this is: 
 MSmits: inline int FastRand(int mod) { g_seed = (214013 * g_seed + 2531011); return (((g_seed &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0x7FFF)* mod) &gt;&gt; 15; }
 struct: well if you want [0,255] range It can compute 32 at once
 MSmits: random generation is mostly not a bottleneck i think if you use this fastrand, but hey, anything you can speed up with avx is a win
 struct: if im not mistaken
 MSmits: sounds awesome
 MSmits: what exactly do you calculate. Is it the final integer, or is it a float that still has to be multiplied with the max to get the integer
 struct: its just this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift</a>
 struct: but avxed
 MSmits: would you feed in an array of different maxima, or do they all have to have the same maximum?
 struct: avxed*
 struct: no they can have different maximum
 MSmits: ahh ok, useful
 tibithegreat: do you avx a bunch of other stuff as well with that or do you generate an array of random numbers with avx and then use normal?
 MSmits: both are possible, depending on the game you use it for i guess
 tibithegreat: cause if you remember it somewhere I think the mem access is slower then recomputing
 MSmits: yeah thats possible
 struct: no tibi, I needed this for csb
 tibithegreat: I used that for UTTT
 tibithegreat: didn't do much, it was something but not much
 MSmits: its impossible for it to do much because random number generation is not taking more than 2% of total time
 MSmits: unless you use std random or something
 MSmits: then its maybe 4-5%
 tibithegreat: well in my UTTT there wasn't really any visible bottleneck
 jacek: is this like this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24001930/avx-sse-version-of-xorshift128">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24001930/avx-sse-version-of-xorshift128</a>
 MSmits: usually it's the way you structure our random rollout
 tibithegreat: like 70% of the time was spent doing simulations
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: thats the bottleneck
 tibithegreat: and the simulation was doing
 tibithegreat: 2-3 additions
 tibithegreat: and a random
 tibithegreat: repeat until check if the game is ended
 tibithegreat: which was precomputed
 MSmits: there are a few things you can do to make those endgame checks cheaper
 MSmits: especially the big board one
 MSmits: smallboard checks are cheap
 tibithegreat: I had the big board precomputed
 MSmits: yeah but that can be a huge array
 tibithegreat: yeah
 tibithegreat: and I also had an EarlyStop precomputed
 MSmits: you can make it smaller if you use 2 bit per entry
 tibithegreat: basically if the big board reaches a certain state it doesn't matter anymore
 MSmits: yeah i do that too
 MSmits: basically i used a 8 bit lookup and then did some shifting, a single 8 bit lookup would cover 4 different boards
 MSmits: helps with cache
 tibithegreat: I think I did that as well
 tibithegreat: but still couldn't reach legend
 tibithegreat: indeed my intuition is the same that the main bottleneck is the cache
 MSmits: then there must have been something wrong. You need only a quarter of my bot's performance to reach legend
 MSmits: maybe a bug
 tibithegreat: probably my stuff is properly stored in memory to be cache friendly
 tibithegreat: i had ~20k iterations on first turn
 MSmits: yeah i have 1 million on the first turn  if i make my bot vanilla
 tibithegreat: wow
 MSmits: maybe you mean 2nd turn
 tibithegreat: yeah
 MSmits: then it's 100k or a little over that
 tibithegreat: first turn I had ~100k
 MSmits: you would need 25k for legend
 tibithegreat: yeah so I heard
 tibithegreat: well it was my first MCTS
 tibithegreat: so I'm decently happy with it (although an inner regret is still there)
 tibithegreat: :D
 MSmits: mine too, but not really. The first time it was my first, but i redid it several times
 MSmits: i keep being drawn back
 tibithegreat: it's a pretty cool game
 MSmits: i think so too, some people hate it and it has its flaws, but it's also a great experience for a while
 MSmits: main flaw is p1/p2 inbalance imho. And well people complain about the volatility of the leaderboard, but I dont mind that too much
 tibithegreat: is p1 favoured?
 MSmits: much favored yes
 tibithegreat: interesting
 MSmits: generally you can guess it as 70% vs 30%
 MSmits: it's because p1 both has a 1 move advantage and gets to pick the best move in the game
 tibithegreat: wow, that's pretty heavy
 jacek: with mcts speed you have (if its not bugged) you should be in legend
 tibithegreat: then maybe it's bugged&#160;:-??
 MSmits: yeah could be
 MSmits: tibithegreat, the very best bots, almost play perfectly as p1.
 MSmits: as in, they dont allow you to win and there's no way to stop them
 tibithegreat: aha
 MSmits: i know because i tested their lines of play in a meta mcts solver program
 tibithegreat: we need a bigger board&#160;:))
 MSmits: they do make mistakes, but very few
 tibithegreat: Ultimate Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
 MSmits: there's several ways to solve the problem
 tibithegreat: where each cell is a UTTT game
 MSmits: one way would be the steal option, that would force p1 to not select a move that is so good
 MSmits: another is random first move, but thats less strong as a solution
 tibithegreat: well UTTT by definition is a deterministic game
 tibithegreat: so someone definetly can 100% win
 tibithegreat: with perfect play
 MSmits: not necessarily
 MSmits: could be drawn
 tibithegreat: either p1 or p2 (probably p1)
 MSmits: with steal it is very likely drawn
 tibithegreat: oh yeah, or draw
 MSmits: regular TTT is draw, even though p1 has a massive advantage
 tibithegreat: but from what I understand the problem is that bots are so good
 tibithegreat: that they get pretty close to solving it
 MSmits: mmh not exactl solving it
 MSmits: it's just that there's  alittle margin of error because p1 has so much advantage
 MSmits: so they are allowed to maybe make 1 mistake and still win
 tibithegreat: I mean, by what move does the bot start zeroing in on the perfect strategy?
 MSmits: oh, my bot solves at 15 plies before the end usually
 MSmits: assuming the opponent doesnt suicide because he knows he lost
 MSmits: but thats solving, the bot should know a bit sooner
 tibithegreat: yeah my guess is that after move X let's say
 MSmits: ply 25-30 is realistic for a bot to be safe if it is still on the path to win
 tibithegreat: there is no more room for error
 tibithegreat: like after move 30 if your bot makes a mistake, the opponent will know exactly how to beat it
 tibithegreat: or with a very high probability
 MSmits: yeah thats safe to assume
 tibithegreat: so that's basically what we are optimizing
 tibithegreat: the smaller X the better the bot
 tibithegreat: and if X reaches 1 then basically the game is solved
 MSmits: well you need to maximize your chances by your opening moves too
 tibithegreat: indeed
 MSmits: using teccles as p1 up to ply 18 or so is a safe bet
 MSmits: then you have to play perfectly for maybe 12 turns (so 6 moves) and after that, if you've got a good bot, you're golden
 MSmits: thats sort of my sense of it
 tibithegreat: aha
 tibithegreat: interesting
 tibithegreat: I'll get back to UTTT at some point
 MSmits: of course p2 can break teccles by sending you to a board with 2 moves on it already
 MSmits: then you got more choices to make
 tibithegreat: but my conclusion was that I had to rewrite the MCTS
 darkhorse64: Does playing teccles as p2 work&#160;?
 tibithegreat: and kinda lazy about it&#160;:-"
 tibithegreat: I wanna try some other games before I get back to it
 MSmits: darkhorse64 not entirely sure, i dont think it hurts you, but dont do it later on
 MSmits: so not after 18 or so
 MSmits: meta mcts almost always converged on teccles as p2 as well
 darkhorse64: OK
 darkhorse64: thx
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: i watched one of re curses uttt games and it used teccles exclusively. I think his training also exposed the heuristic
 MSmits: dont think he needed to hardcode that bit. Meta mcts also finds it fast
 jacek: yeah its so nice to see pure ai to discover good strategy on its own
 MSmits: yeah it is
 tibithegreat: that's why I find RL to be incredibly beautiful
 tibithegreat: especially the "Zero" variations
 tibithegreat: it's like "ok humans played this game for a few thousand years... let's what the AI thinks"
 tibithegreat: will it find the same moves humans did, or were we playing the game wrong the whole time
 MSmits: actually that is how many CG NN's work too i think
 tibithegreat: how can you do NN on CG?
 tibithegreat: do you embed the weights in the source code or what?
 MSmits: yeah
 tibithegreat: bleah
 MSmits: people do it&#160;:)
 MSmits: not very many and it;s not always succesful, but mostly it is, on simple games
 tibithegreat: it would be nice if CG had a more RL friendly environment
 MSmits: you would still need to train your bots offline
 MSmits: cant expect to use server resources for that
 tibithegreat: that's fair
 MSmits: so i guess all they could provide is libraries with functions to make the calculations easier to do
 tibithegreat: well more like a way of uploading the NN weights or something
 tibithegreat: and also the ability to download other agents locally to train against them
 MSmits: well that's similar to just providing support for more than 1 file
 tibithegreat: yep
 1400179: Download other agents, that's gonna go down well
 MSmits: would make counterbooking even easier eh?
 tibithegreat: well in a special friendly environment&#160;:)
 tibithegreat: not for competition
 MSmits: counterbooking aside, it would just make it too easy to exploit RPS effects
 MSmits: tune your parameters to perfectly play against your 1 rival
 tibithegreat: like yeah for a competition it would be cheating galore
 1400179: Don't worry though there's zero chance of something like that happening here
 tibithegreat: fair enough
 MSmits: i like the idea of trainign by selfplay
 MSmits: no need for other bots
 MSmits: and the issue with CG being NN unfriendly. Once you figured it out for 1 game, it's not that big of a deal i suspect
 MSmits: you can just do the same thing for other games
 1400179: At the risk of sounding like a D and elitist and whatnot
 1400179: If the current limitations stop you
 1400179: That probably wouldn't have worked out otherwise
 MSmits: good point
 MSmits: but tibithegreat has a point when it comes to learning
 MSmits: if you want to learn minimax, CG is fine
 tibithegreat: it's great actually
 MSmits: if you want to learn to use a NN here, there are unnecessary hurdles
 MSmits: you have to learn it elsewhere and apply here
 tibithegreat: I mostly use kaggle for my ML learning and stuff&#160;:)
 1400179: People have all sorts of wrong perceptions of NNs
 tibithegreat: what do you mean?
 tibithegreat: I am very beginner level in NN so I'm curios what's your thought on it
 1400179: That you feed it a lot of data and it works out
 tibithegreat: oh&#160;:))
 tibithegreat: yeah that's not exactly how it works
 tibithegreat: my experience is a lot of tuning of meta-parameters
 MSmits: not my perception. You need a to set a lot of parameters and the data needs to be good as well
 MSmits: lots of trial and error
 tibithegreat: yep
 tibithegreat: I did some kaggle stuff
 tibithegreat: and I was basically just binge watchign some stupid show
 tibithegreat: while working on it
 tibithegreat: because I was like "oh let's see what happens if I add one more layer"
 tibithegreat: start training, see you in 2 hours
 tibithegreat: 2 hours later -&gt; ok, that didn't really work
 tibithegreat: let's try changing the activation functions
 tibithegreat: and so on
 MSmits: I think you develop an intuition about it so that after a while you need less trial and error to get to the correct parameters
 tibithegreat: luckily I also have a decent gpu 
 tibithegreat: yeah, but that comes with experience&#160;:)
 MSmits: yea
 tibithegreat: so you have to go through the hurdles of a lot of trial and error first
 tibithegreat: oh and also as you mentioned
 tibithegreat: you need to make sure your data is properly set up
 MSmits: thats for data classification stuff, but I am guessing for an actual game playing bot it's more difficult
 tibithegreat: if you show your NN 10 billion images of dogs and 10k images of other animals
 tibithegreat: and ask it to classify animals
 tibithegreat: you're gonna have a bat time
 tibithegreat: *bad
 MSmits: i am not sure how to do it with a game playing bot. I think I can do a data classification NN (poorly) with some library assistanc
 1400179: It's different challenges
 tibithegreat: with a game I think the reward function is the main problem
 1400179: Zero uses no reward
 MSmits: not even WLD? 
 tibithegreat: Zero is end-to-end?
 1400179: That hardly counts as a reward in its normal definition
 MSmits: yeah ok
 tibithegreat: I thought Zero was just that it didn't do any imitation learning
 tibithegreat: but it makes sense to not have any intermediate reward as well
 1400179: Zero has no domain knowledge other than input
 1400179: Hence the name zero
 tibithegreat: otherwise you are purposely guiding the bot to play as human knowledge dictates
 MSmits: it doesnt try illegal moves though right? 
 tibithegreat: I think it does
 MSmits: mu zero does
 MSmits: a zero doesnt i think
 1400179: The policy may output illegal moves
 1400179: They are masked out
 MSmits: ah ok
 tibithegreat: you can build the output in such a way that it can't really output illegal moves (depending on the game)
 1400179: For long games with poor convergence though then yeah, reward and curriculum becomes a necessity
 tibithegreat: depends on how much hardware and time you have available for training
 tibithegreat: with infinite hardware an AlphaStarZero could be possible
 1400179: Not really, there are domains that are known not to be tractable
 tibithegreat: what do you mean by tractable?
 1400179: That you can't hope to achieve a solution using pure computation
 MSmits: maybe D&amp;B&#160;:)
 tibithegreat: hmm interesting
 tibithegreat: what's D&amp;B? 
 MSmits: remi thinks so
 1400179: Training starcraft from zero would probably need more hardware power than we have
 MSmits: dots and boxes
 tibithegreat: MSmits got it
 tibithegreat: reCurse theoretically still possible
 MSmits: yeah those RTS games are ridiculously complex
 tibithegreat: but just theoretically
 1400179: Sure, theoretically I could resolve covid overnight
 tibithegreat:&#160;:))
 MSmits: dota 2 was done and that's just controling 5 guys, no building and lots of simplifications
 tibithegreat: it wasn't zero tho
 1400179: And a enormous reward function
 tibithegreat: that's what I didn't really like about the dota thing
 tibithegreat: they basically trained it specifically to human knowledge of the game
 1400179: Gotta run bbl
 tibithegreat: like how to cs
 tibithegreat: how to deny
 MSmits: bye reCurse
 tibithegreat: bye
 tibithegreat: like they gave it rewards whenever it would deny a minon, or last hit a minion
 MSmits: ah yeah
 tibithegreat: cool part is seeing the AI figuring that out on it's own
 tibithegreat: like a dog playing chess&#160;:))
 MSmits: the funny thing about using AI in those games is that they will play strategically weak, but they can micromanage the sht out of the game
 tibithegreat: yeah
 MSmits: like you have a zerg army in starcraft and they move each one individually
 tibithegreat: did you see the alpha star demo?
 MSmits: not sure
 tibithegreat: it was a few years ago and it beat some pro players by playing protoss with incredibly blink micro
 MSmits: ohh sounds fun

 tibithegreat: it beat TLO and Mana (if you know sc 2 proplayers)
 MSmits: nah i dont know that much abou tthe SC2 scene
 MSmits: played a ton of RTS i my time though
 MSmits: not specifically SC2
 tibithegreat: they are middle of the pack players
 MSmits: ah ok
 tibithegreat: not the best koreans
 tibithegreat: but not low level either
 MSmits: ah ok, i am watching it now
 tibithegreat: ok, have fun&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 struct: There is a retired(?) pro sc2 player that usually comes here for contests
 struct: nerchio
 tibithegreat: oh
 tibithegreat: yeah he is kinda on the same level
 tibithegreat: as mana and tlo
 BillCrowe: codingame is hard lol

 Angelburgie22: HS it's laggy as f
 DrQuarius: glad it's not just me though. Had to submit my CoC code without even seeing test results
 MaxTheorum: yeah no same her
 Angelburgie22: My code didn't even run, I got a 0%, I am pretty sure it is a 100% tho
 MaxTheorum: e
 DrQuarius: That sucks Angel
 Angelburgie22: IK
 Angelburgie22:&#160;:'|
 MaxTheorum: ah we're back online
 Angelburgie22: Yes, we are

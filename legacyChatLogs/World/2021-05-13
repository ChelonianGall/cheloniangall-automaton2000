 FerrusDude: heh, I remember when Rust was exotic.
 FerrusDude: :upside_down:
 XeroOl: it still sort of is for me
 XeroOl: but yeah,
 pmor: i remember when c++ was exotic 
 XeroOl: hoooray it finally compiles
 XeroOl: that means it works perfectly, right?&#160;:)
 actualCoderTrevor: I remember when flipping switches on the front of the Altair was exotic.
 actualCoderTrevor: Although I wasn't alive yet.
 ClockSort: looks like it worked @ninjadoggy, now in 45th place?!
 XeroOl: congrats
 KCrown: tell us ur secrets ninjadoggy?
 FerrusDude: It compiled?!! :beers:
 FerrusDude: It probably won't have a runtime error, unless you were unsafe. hehehe
 XeroOl: lmao I realized my sim is only half done
 XeroOl: I need to implement getting all the valid actions
 FerrusDude: but you have appeased The Compiler
 XeroOl: yeah
 FerrusDude: I'm not going to lie, Rust takes substantially longer for me to write vs other languages
 XeroOl: that's what I've noticed too
 XeroOl: ruby: 10 seconds to write
 XeroOl: rust: more than 10 seconds to write
 FerrusDude: rust: runs in ns
 XeroOl: try crystal-lang then lol
 FerrusDude: also rust: compiles for a minute
 FerrusDude: hehehe
 XeroOl: yeah rust compile times are why I don't like it more as a language
 FerrusDude: I'll put it on my todo stack
 XeroOl: is it just me or does codingame not give you red squigglies on compiler errors
 XeroOl: for me you just have to hit "play" and then let it fail to compile
 FerrusDude: do you have VS Code?
 XeroOl: nope lol
 XeroOl: I don't even have rust on my computer
 FerrusDude: you can install the RLS feed and that will give you all the compiler errors ahead of time
 FerrusDude: :D
 XeroOl: ahh, so rls does support that
 XeroOl: that's nice
 FerrusDude: so then you can pull a me, not notice and try to compile anyway
 FerrusDude: :joy:
 XeroOl: it will at least tell you the line number and warp you there
 XeroOl: which is great
 FerrusDude: that is a big improvement
 XeroOl: yeah I'm editing in codingame
 XeroOl: and it's not fun
 FerrusDude: CG used to break the compile on any warning ... 
 FerrusDude:&#160;:|
 XeroOl: lmao that must be fun
 XeroOl: it feels like turning in a test, and then getting nitpicked over all the little mistakes lol
 FerrusDude: the Compiler also lints ... because the compiler team. haha ... /sigh
 XeroOl: you'd have stupidly clean code lol
 FerrusDude: yerp
 XeroOl: how do you iterate over all the places I could seed from a tree
 XeroOl: this seems like a nightmare to do the way I'm doing it
 XeroOl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/mjNNTCw0">https://pastebin.com/mjNNTCw0</a>
 XeroOl: I need to fill in the // TODO with a Plant() that returns the next valid index I can plant in
 FerrusDude: I'm using the rand crate, which CG kindly supports.
 XeroOl: like, randomly choose squares that are eligible? lol
 FerrusDude: ( syntax comment: you can leave off the return if you also leave off the&#160;; )
 XeroOl: not in that position
 FerrusDude: I'm not proud, but it works. lol
 XeroOl: because there's an if statement afterward
 NoDanCoder: how can i go to the next problem?
 XeroOl: @NoDanCoder what do you mean?
 NoDanCoder: i just finished tutorial, where is the next excercise button?
 FerrusDude: Go to Practice Tab
 NoDanCoder: sortof leetcode
 XeroOl: The exercies aren't ordered, but you can find them under `Activities &gt; Practice` at the top
 NoDanCoder: ohhh thanks
 FerrusDude: And then just like dive in and cause havok
 FerrusDude: hehe
 XeroOl: or, if you click the Home icon in the top left, you can do the quest tree thingy
 XeroOl: which will link you to the right part of the site
 XeroOl: to do whichever thing you pick
 Smelty: hmm
 Smelty: yes

 eulerscheZahl: i can't even go fullscreen for a minute without missing some action
 eulerscheZahl: and chat is still laggy in typing
 eulerscheZahl: back to undercover
 UndercoverToad: had a private chat with someone asking for help going on
 UndercoverToad: whatever

 BlaiseEbuth: :o 
 dbdr: I constantly get private requests from strangers for help in the contest
 UndercoverToad: so far I only got a few this time
 UndercoverToad: when they start with HEY BRO in all caps, I ignore them entirely
 UndercoverToad: or when they ask about the height of my paycheck
 dbdr: :D
 FrancoisB: :joy:
 none_: what is key to league opening? It seems never to correspond with date on the popup or time remaining...
 aCat: btw do you folks do some action pruning / permutation removal?
 UndercoverToad: i don't even generate permutations
 aCat: that's what i want to do
 aCat: AFTER learning my algo to actually complete trees not only guthering suns to eternity ^^'
 aCat: *gathering
 none_: just bunch of if/else with some score calculation to decide what's best action seems to work fine...
 UndercoverToad: i cheat a bit by just decreasing nutrient at each wait
 UndercoverToad: motivates to complete
 derjack: oO
 aangairbender: I just assume I take 2 nutrients for each tree instead of decreasing on  WAIT
 aangairbender: tried both option btw
 aCat: btw thanks for printing stats euler - got some point of reference
 UndercoverToad: maybe i should hide them
 aCat: :D
 UndercoverToad: my sim count is low
 aCat: d is in action depth, and n is sates I assume
 UndercoverToad: day depth
 aCat: I know, but eval heavy ;p
 aCat: day depth?
 UndercoverToad: day depth
 aCat: so you never finish your sim in the middle of the day?
 UndercoverToad: no
 aCat: I mean layer
 UndercoverToad: absolutely barbaric
 aCat: :D
 aCat: so it is possible to generate all legal actions for the entire day at once...
 UndercoverToad: no
 aCat: so cut by actions normally, but do not consider states from unifiinished days as final
 aCat: that was my first thought, but then I started wondering... ;p
 none_: I don't think that's good idea. If you decide just at the beginning of day you won't react to your opponents moves. For example you might won't to change cell for your seed if you opponent seeds some other cell...
 aCat: that's not about this
 solistice: another day, same frustrations :D
 UndercoverToad: ++
 aCat: that's about returning as best state, the state from depth that finishes the day - even if you searched some more layers
 KCrown: insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result 
 aCat: if this cat get this correctly
 derjack: reinforcement learning experts disagree
 none_: well going into future generated tons of options and it takes only one move of your opponent to destroy most of them...
 none_: *generates
 UndercoverToad: but do you have a better idea?
 none_: assign priorities to possible actions and then pick best one based on current state of game.
 UndercoverToad: minimax is too expensive, i even fail to find good moves in single player mode
 aCat: given s fantastic eval you could make some shallow depth opponent prediction
 UndercoverToad: i kind of do what you suggest
 dbdr: also minimax is assymetric
 derjack: this game is something like optimization problem, almost no opponent interaction
 UndercoverToad: just hard to see what works well
 aCat: and behave as he made this moves in your beam
 UndercoverToad: which is why we try to look a few turns ahead to see it it might be a good move
 UndercoverToad: i've seen wal a planting trees to shadow 2 of my large trees and then directly cutting them after
 UndercoverToad: so there is a bit of interaction
 UndercoverToad: placing a tree to piss off your opponent twice
 aCat: ^^'
 none_: especially at the beginning (with lot of possible moves) future has many possibilities. Most of them with similar result...:D
 none_: what I've seen between Top 10, these guys focus primarily on tree placement (so tree has best chance of getting sun exposure), harvesting quite soon (to get bonus points), and saving some sun points at the end when it's not worth to upgrade/complete trees...
 UndercoverToad: sounds simple but how to achieve this
 none_: well, tree placemen -&gt; pick place which will have most sun exposure (most directions without other trees)
 UndercoverToad: check, the eval function will handle this
 none_: harvesting -&gt; some kind of optimization based on game 'day', you don't won't to cut to early, because bigger tree == more sun point, but you don't won't to wait too long, because your opponent will take bonus points. also you don't wont' to end up with forest of big trees and no time to cut them. also more tree you have, more expensive it is to get another...
 none_: * won't = want
 VizGhar: everything you saying should be handled by eval function
 none_: no sure, what you mean by eval function, but my point is: it's not worth to look too far in future. good strategy can be based on current state of game.
 none_: *no = not
 KCrown: do you think you can get into legends none_? 
 none_: I don't know what's limit for these leagues. right now I am 78th.
 KCrown: about 20
 UndercoverToad: in the past it was even less than 20 but for gold CG was very generous
 none_: well, probably depends. my best position was 30something yesterday. I still have some plans, don't know how they will work.
 UndercoverToad: i think the TypeScript and Perl bot have a good chance to become the boss
 KCrown: what plan? 
 none_: that's a secret...:D
 KCrown: hehe
 UndercoverToad: you can tell me, i don't even playno UndercoverToad on the leaderbaord
 none_: sure, smurf account... :D
 Astrobytes: good morning
 KCrown: everyone is a blue smurf?
 none_: Google: Noun. smurf account (plural smurf accounts) (Internet slang) An alternative computer account used by a known or experienced user in order to deceptively self-present as someone naïve or less experienced.
 UndercoverToad: can you help me with Power of Thor please?
 Ajaiy2: Oof
 Ajaiy2: I know you are kidding
 jrke: why legendary toad need help :thinking:
 jrke: he is trying to be like new codingamers
 Ajaiy2: Yeah.. with a really easy puzzle..
 jrke: right?
 derjack: if he does, why doesnt he clash
 UndercoverToad: i just tried to fit into the role that wikipedia suggests
 Ajaiy2: What role?
 none_: :D
 Astrobytes: go back 7 or 8 messages
 UndercoverToad: "self-present as someone naïve or less experienced"
 aangairbender: I really like how that TypeScript guy plays, so consistent
 UndercoverToad: your future gold boss
 UndercoverToad: to show everyone that it's possible without C++ they like to take bosses in a different language
 none_: #1 right now uses Java...&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: i know, fighting him in IDE right now
 UndercoverToad: losing big time but I want to understand why
 VizGhar: can you understand search algo bot?
 UndercoverToad: i can understand what's going on and try to grasp how
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553908931">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553908931</a>e.g. check my tree on cell 4 early on
 UndercoverToad: that's a conspiration
 UndercoverToad: conspiracy*
 UndercoverToad: he always make sure I get some shadow and then chops off the tree
 UndercoverToad: as if he would care more about my sun points than his
 dbdr: #sadistBot
 hsm_akb: guys i have a q about my code , how can i share it to get hep?
 none_: he also cuts really soon and gets all these bonus points... from there it seems like uphill battle...
 UndercoverToad: i figured so much
 UndercoverToad: hsm_akb is it code for the current contest? then no
 LLG: my bot caps out at ~400 silver again
 LLG: it seems to favor cutting very early and very late, and building econ midgame
 LLG: instead of keeping a good pace like the top bots
 IronJelly_e821: hi
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553951489">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553951489</a>
 Noyotens: i need help
 UndercoverToad: Noyotens the spawn at frame 10 is bad (both yours and the bosses)
 UndercoverToad: find a spot that's not in line with your existing trees (like cell 18)
 UndercoverToad: same again when you spawn at 8
 UndercoverToad: pretty much any seed at the beginning is to be avoided
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553953507">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553953507</a>

 Noyotens: now???
 UndercoverToad: no
 dbdr: 22 and 2 are in line
 UndercoverToad: that's nothing you can fix in 2 minutes by playing with the same bot over and over again
 UndercoverToad: SEED 22 10 would be a good move
 Noyotens: but how i can is in line or not
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: you can check if the position is directly next to one of your trees and start from there. Generally better to have your trees more spread out
 UndercoverToad: kepps them safe from the bark beetle too
 dbdr: legend rule?
 Noyotens: NotSureWhyThisWorks how
 UndercoverToad: oh, i shouldn't have mentioned that yet
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Noyotens if you use the game's representation of the board it gives you the indices of neighbouring places on the grid
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: UndercoverToad you're trolling right? lol
 UndercoverToad: with the bark beetle? I just like bad jokes
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553961590">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553961590</a>
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lmao I don't even know what a bark beetle is
 UndercoverToad: regarding the spawn location i'm dead serious
 UndercoverToad: it's a beetle that can make trees sick and die
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: nice Noyotens
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: much better
 Noyotens: thx
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: interesting UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: it's not
 Noyotens: UndercoverToad
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lol
 UndercoverToad: *seeding is not much better now
 UndercoverToad: race condition
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: is there a gold boss?
 UndercoverToad: not until tomorrow
 Ziurke: Bosses are only present in some league if there is a higher league
 LLG: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553948284">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/553948284</a>
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: enough time to fix my sim
 LLG: I use the same heuristics throughout the game
 LLG: idk why it plays the early game kinda well, but then completely blows the midgame
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: LLG the trees look quite bunched together
 LLG: they do
 Noyotens: #UndercoverToad can u tell me how u cheek the tree is in line or not
 LLG: but not at the beginning tho
 Noyotens: Plz tell me
 LLG: I didn't check if my trees block each other though
 LLG: I just have a function called TurnsUntilShadowed
 LLG: which I run for all of my trees
 UndercoverToad: do you have a Cell class with an array of neighbors Noyotens?
 Noyotens: yes
 LLG: so if I have a size 2 trees that has TurnsUntilShadowed=5 I expect to gain 10 suns from it
 UndercoverToad: great. then you have 2 spots (tree, seed) - do that for each of your existing trees
 LLG: and that's part of my eval
 UndercoverToad: or better start from seed, forget my previous line
 LLG: with a decent weight, idk why my bot still bunch up my trees
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: LLG do you factor in that trees will generally grow in later days?
 UndercoverToad: so for each of the 6 directions you go 3 steps wide: seed.neighbors[dir], seed.neighbors[dir].neighbors[dir] seed.neighbors[dir].neighbors[dir].neighbors[dir]
 UndercoverToad: then you count the number of cells where you already have a tree
 LLG: I don't, but it should work for my trees anyway
 Noyotens: #UndercoverToad can u tell me how u cheek the tree is in line or not
 UndercoverToad: find a seed location with a low number of existing trees
 UndercoverToad: i just did
 Noyotens: u dont answer my ques
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: LLG if you grow a tree then it will change the value you calculated
 LLG: because if I simulated a GROW move on my own tree, then the shadow map should get updated
 UndercoverToad: you don't try to understand my answer
 UndercoverToad: god dammit
 dbdr: he did answer
 LLG: there are 2 ways
 Lizerino: he doesnt want an answer he wants the code
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: dude gave him the code as well basically
 LLG: you either use cube coordinates and check if they're on the same axis
 Noyotens: i dont want code
 LLG: or check for neighbors in the same direction if you're using spiral coords
 Lizerino: im still stuck doing the same true false kind of bot.. i want to try some kind of ga or nn
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Noyotens the direction of the neighbour is given by the index of it in the game's input at the start
 LLG: I'm still doing a beam search, whose depth is continually getting gutted as my eval function grows heavier
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: neighbour_0 will always be in the same direction regardless of where it comes from
 UndercoverToad: from if-else to neural network? that's a huge step
 Lizerino: is there a middle step
 UndercoverToad: beam search is relatively straight forward
 UndercoverToad: that's what i'm doing as well
 LLG: also euler since you're also doing beam
 Noyotens: #UndercoverToad u work with AI
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I am stuck on implementing beam search
 Ajaiy2: I give up, im gonna just start working on bitboards
 LLG: do you calculate the eval of a sequence of move
 LLG: using discounted sum of differences in eval
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: The number of seeding options is heaps and the number of possible turns in a day is crazy
 UndercoverToad: no Noyotens, i mostly write Windows desktop applications at work
 LLG: I tried that and it improves my bot a bit
 Noyotens: me too
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: How many possible combinations of turns are there for a day?
 LLG: a lot
 UndercoverToad: thousands if not more
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I don't understand how a search can be implemented that well because of this
 LLG: exponentially so if you also do opponent sim
 Lizerino: you prune the branches that are not going to turn out well
 Lizerino: that narrows the search quite a bit
 UndercoverToad: beam search = you generate all possible moves and try to give them a score depending on how good they are (e.g. counting suns after day 23)
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: but even just generating the branches and evaluating them is heaps
 UndercoverToad: then you keep the best and drop the rest
 LLG: you can also prune sequences that lead to the same result
 UndercoverToad: repeat a few times
 LLG: for example seed 1 then seed 2 is essentially the same as seed 2 then seed 1
 Lizerino: i find the biggest problem is to figure out a good way to evaluate a position..
 LLG: and yeah
 LLG: eval is the big problem
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: like the number of branches that have to be generated at a depth of 1 day is still thousands in the middle game
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: right?
 LLG: depends on your beam width, but yes
 UndercoverToad: it's normal that a bot analyzes tens of thousands of boards each turn
 Lizerino: place 625 silver for an if else bot.. could  be worse.. but yeah i need to write something that doesnt depend on me being the smart one
 UndercoverToad: you still have to be smart when you write a search
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: In my experience can't there easily be tens of thousands of different game states at a depth of one or two? And this is before pruning
 UndercoverToad: the eval makes the brain
 Lizerino: let me rephrase it.. that doesnt depend on me being a good photosynthesis player
 LLG: euler do you only rely on the final eval to decide your move, or do you rely on a combination of each state's eval in the sequence?
 Noyotens: :cry:
 UndercoverToad: i keep a bit of score from the path, but mostly the final state
 LLG: I see
 Lizerino: ah wells.. thats a project for later.. good luck guys..
 dbdr: I don't keep score from the path
 UndercoverToad: mine is very minor. e.g. i check if a seed locations is good or bad only on seed action
 LLG: I weight each state eval lower the deeper they are in the sequence
 UndercoverToad: want to memorize that
 LLG: not sure if that's a great idea
 LLG: it worked in the potion game, but idk bout this one
 dbdr: only one way to answer the question, try it
 LLG: I am
 LelouchVC2: dont try it
 LLG: my logic behind the discounted weight is that if it finds a really good move later on, but has to make a bad move early
 LLG: then if the game doesn't play out exactly as planned
 LLG: I'm stuck with a bad move
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/553948284">https://www.codingame.com/replay/553948284</a>
 Noyotens: how u know is the best move
 UndercoverToad: we don't, we try to approximate and avoid the stupid move
 dbdr: yes, that's a reasonable way of thinking LLG
 Noyotens: how u know is the stupid move
 Noyotens: to avoid him
 Kiat: you seed into cell surround by 6 tree that is stupid move
 Kiat: define all stupid move and avoid those
 Noyotens: ok

 UndercoverToad: no, my copy-pasting from the local IDE ended in the web IDE and not the chat&#160;:)
 LLG: I deleted a whitespace and now my bot is saving all trees until the very end of the game
 LLG: what is this sorcery
 VizGhar: Euler third... wp
 Nerchio: hes there since a couple of days but ok :D
 VizGhar: He was 4-8 mostly
 VizGhar: I don't have enough mental energy to simulate opponent. so I'll end up in first 300-500... meeting my target for this contest. Learned a lot
 Nerchio: you can be higher without simulating opponent
 LLG: I did more bitwise operators in the past few days
 UndercoverToad: i'm just drifting up and down while others are submitting
 Nerchio: in fact probably top10
 LLG: than I have my entire life
 UndercoverToad: i don't simulate the opponent so I can confirm top10
 VizGhar: Yes nerchio... but I lack skills&#160;:)
 KCrown: wow there are prizes?
 KCrown: T-shirts hehe
 VizGhar: I have to see other peoples solutions for any board game bots
 VizGhar: not sure where to find those
 VizGhar: I simply cant write good eval function
 UndercoverToad: tshirts and canvases with the contest artwork
 LLG: in theory it's just [weight * state.some_info]
 LLG: rinse and repeat, and tune the weights
 LLG: but it's harder in practice

 UndercoverToad: a painting (printed), 40x30cm
 KCrown: not that I think I can get into the top 3 top 20 maybe ... 
 KCrown: oh like art work? :P 
 UndercoverToad: the one you see on the contest startpage
 UndercoverToad: that "animal" in the trees
 KCrown: hehe cute ... its not ur typical computer contest prize ... 
 LLG: my sim count is nearly halved at the cost of slightly better heuristics...
 VizGhar: What would you do with it? :O
 ddreams: with what?
 VizGhar: with that canvas (sry)
 KCrown: no idea ... but a t-shirt you can show off ... 
 UndercoverToad: what is the typical prize? a raspberry pi?
 ddreams: what do you usually do with paintings?
 KCrown: a USB drive? :P 
 UndercoverToad: i don't know but the wall sounds like a good place for a painting

 KCrown: thanks ... just good info :P 
 LLG: 1300 lines of c#
 solistice: 1400 c# (ddirtyyy)
 Astrobytes: 236 lines of C++
 KCrown: seems like everyone is about the same size 
 solistice: there's probably someone with a python 1-liner :D
 KCrown: except for the 236 liner :P 
 Nerchio: 1300 java but too much useless code i stopped using
 VizGhar: Astro1kbytes
 AntiSquid: 600, is that what i need to do? add more lines?
 VizGhar: ok 200 places improvement... one more such day and i'm at top
 Ajaiy2: I am so glad I am using bitboards now, its a breeze to initialize them
 KCrown: What did you do VizGhar? 
 VizGhar: rewrote it all and improved eval
 KCrown: hehe
 VizGhar: its funny... i see myself in top 50-100 in about year or so... slowly starting to understand it all
 LelouchVC2: People still use Java?
 KCrown: this one seems deeper than the older ones I tried 
 VizGhar: KCrown what are we talking about now? contests?

 Michael_Howard: Why do people do that? :point_up:
 Uljahn: they don't know about #clash channel
 AntiSquid: even then why do they spam the links? nobody spam multiplayer links

 VizGhar: kick
 UndercoverToad: 650 lines to answer a question from when I was eating lunch
 UndercoverToad: but some dead code
 UndercoverToad: oh, jolindien is submitting. there goes my reference if I improved
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I could probably reduce mine by half by refactoring
 AntiSquid: same :P
 UndercoverToad: you still aren't in gold astro
 Astrobytes: I'm playing slowly
 Astrobytes: 274 in silver currently
 UndercoverToad: fix it
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: have same code repeated for each command
 VizGhar: wow robo is fourth?
 Astrobytes: Yeah same AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: why is that a surprise VizGhar&#160;?
 VizGhar: wasn't he doing just heuristic?
 AntiSquid: heuristics are very strong here either way
 VizGhar: funny how my thrown away hardcoded early game is automatically solved by beam search&#160;:)
 VizGhar: really? I can't imagine hardcoding midgame
 VizGhar: just vague ideas
 AntiSquid: anything can work
 VizGhar: maybe thats why I'm ~200 rank
 UndercoverToad: Robo is a strong player, he won a contest before
 UndercoverToad: no need to be surprised about him at 4th place
 AntiSquid: i am sure he can switch very fast to new code 
 RoboStac: I'm not, trying to convert to this new bitboard format for faster sun has broken everything
 UndercoverToad: i broke my scoring. now I seed in turn 1
 VizGhar: heh... gogo toad
 AntiSquid: i mean why would heuristics be considered weak? good domain specific knowledge always helps .
 RoboStac: I don't think I've said what I'm using other than talking about trying to solve endgames
 UndercoverToad: a mix of domain knowledge and the possibility to try out things helps
 RoboStac: which obviously isn't heuristics
 AntiSquid: not debating your bot&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: end game solver sounds complicated
 UndercoverToad: you surely have my admiration if you succeed
 VizGhar: hmm maybe just my bad memory
 KelvinAndHubbles: is the timeout timings different in arena? Have gotten losses due to timeouts multiple times, but send to IDE every time and can't replicate it
 Astrobytes: best to leave a 5-10ms buffer if you want to avoid the time spikes
 Nerchio: sad but true
 AntiSquid: my new C++ code: 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/483e6763-2719-4c83-8436-b534e4f1629f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/483e6763-2719-4c83-8436-b534e4f1629f</a>
 jrke: looks great squiddy
 Nerchio: lol
 ddreams: you didn't forget the endl
 ddreams: good job
 VizGhar: clap clap
 ddreams: found a nice little bug.. applying a seed move didn't mark the location as taken, so the search sometimes seeded the same location several times
 ddreams: fix gave 60% wins in self play
 schachmatt: morning all
 schachmatt: damn did gold get bigger? just woke up and  my bot dropped from ~200 to 83 overnight
 schachmatt: congrats to the ~120 people who got promoted :laughing:
 KalamariKing: gm peeps
 KalamariKing: is language assist still down
 KalamariKing: no? Epic
 ddreams: isn't it annoying to use the web editor?
 KalamariKing: Oh, very
 ddreams: so why do you use it?
 KalamariKing: It's all I got
 ddreams: you can't install any software on your machine?
 KalamariKing: Nope
 KalamariKing: I mean, it's whatever, it works fine for me
 ddreams: can you download and run programs without installing though?
 KalamariKing: No
 KalamariKing: Nothing
 ddreams: School or work laptop, I guess
 KalamariKing: Yup
 none_: that's bad, once you get to higher leagues, it's really useful to be able to run you code against your code lot of times to compare it. You don't get good results by clicking in browser...
 KalamariKing: I won't get good results either way so it's whatever
 mhpd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/17492990e7d388b3144cb7be41ea27085202a6d">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/17492990e7d388b3144cb7be41ea27085202a6d</a>
 KalamariKing: #clash
 KalamariKing: not world
 Ajaiy2: I really can't find a way to store all 222 neighbours efficiently. How do you all store it?
 AntiSquid: 222 neighbours?
 Ajaiy2: Yeah, 37 cells * 6
 AntiSquid: oh had no idea
 none_: Cell { Map&lt;Integer, Cell&gt; neighboars} very efficient, I know... :D 
 KalamariKing: 1. Some cells don't have 6 neighbors (outside cells)2. Why do you need to store all the neighbors? A simple bitmask shift will suffice
 KalamariKing: none_ neighbors*
 Ajaiy2: Oh, I forgot all of them don't have 6 neighbours
 none_: I know... :D
 KalamariKing: ok wtf? I'm printing an action but it's not picking it up
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: is there a way to do a bitmask shift for neihbours that are two squares away?
 none_: I envy you guys if you are able to live with bitmask shifts. I always hated them and probably always will...
 JRFerguson: you are none alone
 JRFerguson: too painful to debug
 Numby: Can make some pretty printing/toString functions to make easier to debug
 JRFerguson: yes, but still...
 JRFerguson: i have enough trouble debugging my beam search without bitmaps
 Dragonlong: 1
 Numby: For next competition I'm definitely setting up IDE+unit tests though. This was painful debugging and always uncertain when I make changes if im breaking my code
 Numby: I changed board representation few times 
 Nerchio: the only thing i'd like to figure out is how to easily copy 1 round into local ide
 Nerchio: i've seen people say just print to error and copy as arguments?
 aCat: yep
 Nerchio: but if my bot uses previous rounds as information its kinda rip
 aCat: or you can download from replay json
 aCat: and simulate from the beginning
 aCat: yes, that's harder to sim on local
 JRFerguson: nerchio
 JRFerguson: i have this code at the beggining of my local while(1)
 JRFerguson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/158c2ef0-5010-45d7-a8c4-7bcffd916651">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/158c2ef0-5010-45d7-a8c4-7bcffd916651</a>
 JRFerguson: and then i just copy all err print from ide console to my input
 JRFerguson: from start to the turn i want to test
 Nerchio: hmm makes sense
 dreadylein: @NotSureWhyThisWorks depends on how you desigend the data, but you allready do the math for it if you simulate shadows, just make sure to save the shadows of dist2 , they are also the dist2 fields of the board
 dreadylein: well the fields with 2 distance to the target cell&#160;:)
 RoboStac: there are fields dist 2 apart that aren't shadows though (eg 0 / 12)
 dreadylein: ah true
 solistice: what do you mean by IDE+unit tests setup? are there tools?
 Nerchio: yeah
 Chainman: hellloooo
 Nerchio: but you need a little bit of a setup
 solistice: are there resources on how to do it?
 Numby: There are different IDEs and unit testing frameworks that are popular depending on the language you're using. There's a lot of resources yeah; what language are you using?
 Numby: Actually screw this; I'm done trying to incrementally improve my mess of a code and failing miserably to add MCTS on top of it. Ill just start anew with IDE and tests and new representation
 KalamariKing: gl Numby
 Ajaiy2: Good Luck reaching Legend on time, Numby
 Numby: Is legend a fixed cut off? (i.e. top 100)
 KalamariKing: I don't think so
 KalamariKing: Otherwise you might drop down a league which I've been told is impossible
 linjoehan: man I forgot about this thing I gots to catch up
 UndercoverToad: in the past legend usually was around top15
 UndercoverToad: top 100 is not realistic, it will be less
 AllYourTrees: wasn't it 80 in the last comp?
 UndercoverToad: final size, yes
 UndercoverToad: not on league opening
 AllYourTrees: ahhhh
 alchemsti: Ha, I'm also going to start somewhat fresh
 alchemsti: Too annoying trying to coax my eval to plan in future stuff
 Numby: Ah that's pretty brutal. I've seen other competitions with 100+ in legend but guess many of those were submitted after those competitions ended
 alchemsti: Like not planting a seed so I can grow a tree
 alchemsti: I kind of do it now, but it's just not reliable enough.
 struct: I think it will be a bit more than 15 this time
 struct: I expect 100 players in legend a few hours after it opens
 alchemsti: FWIW I expect more than 15 as well with 1100 in gold at the moment
 alchemsti: 100 (top 10%) seems not crazy
 alchemsti: maybe 50?
 struct: 100 is too high
 struct: 25 max
 struct: But I was wrong on silver so
 struct: gold*
 UndercoverToad: i bet against the 100 after a few hours struct. even if I was totally wrong on the last 2 leagues
 UndercoverToad: the TypeScript bot looks like a good boss to me
 solistice: hi Numby, I'm using C#
 AntiSquid: ya well i guessed silver correctly, with aprox 25% :P
 AntiSquid: 15 for leg my guess
 itzluku: boss is always a player?
 AntiSquid: maybe even 20 since it's big comp
 AntiSquid: don't expect low numbers for silver / gold when only leg really matters, only leg gets recalc for example 
 KalamariKing: wdym recalc?
 Lucky30_: Hello everyone
 Lucky30_: عيد مبارك سعيد ✨🌙
 Lucky30_: Aid Mubarak Said
 KalamariKing: We're over 60% done with the contest, who's doing well
 Lucky30_: #Fêtes musulmanes #Muslim holidays
 Lucky30_: not me, KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: lol neither me
 alchemsti: not me
 alchemsti: BUT THAT WILL CHANGE
 Lucky30_: my goal for this contest what to get to silver
 alchemsti: :D
 AlMualem: guys, the map we are playing is called hexagonal grind?
 Michael_Howard: Sorry for the nooby question, but can someone complete then seed on the same cell in the same turn? (Not day.)
 alchemsti: No
 Lucky30_: probably AlMualem
 alchemsti: One action per day -- afterwards tree is 'dormant'
 Michael_Howard: It's not a tree though. It's been completed.
 Michael_Howard: It's an empty cell.
 alchemsti: Ah sorry, misunderstood
 alchemsti: Yes, I think so
 AlMualem: technically you can yes
 alchemsti: although....
 KalamariKing: If you complete a tree does the CELL go dormant?
 alchemsti: in the same *turn*?
 KalamariKing: Or can you seed there next turn?
 alchemsti: since you can't do two actions in one turn, no
 AlMualem: i think only a "tree" can be called dormant 
 alchemsti: not sure if opponent can complete and you can seed...
 KalamariKing: I think not
 alchemsti: I'd have to read the ref code
 alchemsti: If they verify moves, then apply then no
 alchemsti: I suspect they do that, since otherwise the "simultaneous seed'  rule wouldn't apply
 alchemsti: someone would get there first
 alchemsti: So, I suspect no, but would have to read the code to be sure.
 AlMualem: guys, to my understanding,a good start to improve your bot is to seed at cell with distance &gt;=2,does this make sense?
 Michael_Howard: alchemsti it says "As long as you have enough sun points, you can take any number of actions." - I thought this meant same turn?
 alchemsti: yes, and ideally where you don't shade yourself (seeding)
 Michael_Howard: I was planning to rush harvests &amp; stuff&#160;:)
 alchemsti: You can take any number of actions in a day (given sun pts)
 alchemsti: But you do one action after the other
 AlMualem: but at some point you will shadow your self right?
 Michael_Howard: Ah, OK. That makes sense. Thanks.
 Ajaiy2: I think you can do multiple actions at a time in the next leagues
 alchemsti: AlMualem sorta but not so much. Play against a top bot, and see how it plants. basically at a diamon offset.
 alchemsti: diamond
 alchemsti: e.g from hex 0 to hex 8
 alchemsti: They will never shade each other
 aangairbender: hey guys
 DaNinja: referee marks completed trees as dormant until the end of the turn, then removes them
 alchemsti: thanks DaNinja&#160;!
 AlMualem: i observed the gold bot and it seeds at 8 specific indexes (depending on the first 2 indexes)..all of them have distance 2
 AlMualem: if the abs(index_of_seeding_tree-index_seeded_tree) &gt;=8 its always &gt;=2 the distance
 aangairbender: I saw dbdr on the 1st place, created game with him to see what smart things he does, and.. I won wtf
 Michael_Howard: AlMualem can we borrow your time machine? I want to play the gold bot too&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: aangairbender try again on the same map with swapped positions
 AlMualem: yes ofc
 UndercoverToad: some maps are really unfair
 AlMualem: true dat
 aangairbender: how can do it UndercoverToad? you mena just swap players in IDE with same seed?
 UndercoverToad: did you set the IDE to expert yet?
 UndercoverToad: settings on the left =&gt; expert mode
 UndercoverToad: then go to options =&gt; manual and just keep the existing seed
 UndercoverToad: delete players and add them again in reverse order, hit "play"
 aangairbender: its was on expert already, I see
 aangairbender: first 5 days were totally symmetric:grinning:
 AntiSquid: legend opens on 17 according to IDE
 UndercoverToad: these symmetric opening moves are rather common
 AntiSquid: so monday instead of friday
 AntiSquid: or is mine bugged?
 RoboStac: have you had the tab open for 3 days?
 aangairbender: I have CG tab open from the start of contest
 AntiSquid: new tab
 RoboStac: hmm, mine still shows tommorow
 RoboStac: I always thought that bug was based on when the tab opened 
 AntiSquid: ah did duplicate tab ... opened new one by pasting link shows tomorrow
 KalamariKing: this tab has been open since the start of the contest, no bugs or anything
 UndercoverToad: don't you guys turn off your computers?
 UndercoverToad: i even sleep in that room, I always turn it off
 AntiSquid: i put it in suspend mode
 AntiSquid: when it's contest or stuff i don't want to reopen when i come back
 AntiSquid: mine isn't that noisy either
 UndercoverToad: right, that wastes at least 5 seconds
 AntiSquid: multiboot isn't that fast or maybe my setup is wrong
 AntiSquid: 10 seconds - 15 
 AntiSquid: and then opening all the individual things i had open
 UndercoverToad: oh, i just considered opening browser+codingamer
 UndercoverToad: -r
 LLG: oh also euler
 LLG: are you planning on writing a post mortem after this
 LLG: usually I learn a lot from those blogs after contests
 solistice: is there a smart way to count all set bits in an integer? or just loop and shift?
 UndercoverToad: depends on my final rank. right now i tend to say no as i see myself dropping hard on the last weekend
 RoboStac: solistice - which lang?
 solistice: c#
 solistice: sorry
 RoboStac: I believe so - its usually called popcount. One of the c# users can probably help more
 aangairbender: there is a way with time complexity O(amount of ones)
 UndercoverToad: BitOperations.PopCount((ulong)number)
 UndercoverToad: it's is System.Numerics
 Marchete: I have big differences in performance
 Marchete: between my computer and CG
 struct: same compiler?
 Marchete: my computer, release mode -&gt; 700k sim
 Marchete: CG IDE, 70k
 Marchete: dotnet 3.1
 aangairbender: also there is System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Popcnt.X64.PopCount()
 aangairbender: **some random stackoverflow copied answer**
 UndercoverToad: right. that crashes on my machine (it's old and doesn't support the operation)
 aangairbender: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.popcnt.popcount?view=netcore-3.0">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.popcnt.popcount?view=netcore-3.0</a>
 aangairbender: seems pretty new
 RoboStac: I'd imagine they're the same if supported, just the intrinsic only works on some cpus?
 RoboStac: whereas the generic has a slower fallback
 therealbeef: I tuned down the optimization options on my local build, but still: 3.5M state evals locally vs only 1.9M on CG :P
 Marchete: intrinsic throws exception
 Marchete: if you don't have it
 Nerchio: Marchete idk if that helps but for me local is also faster but only like 2x in java
 Marchete: thanks
 Marchete: I was seeing 10x perf difference
 reCurse: Maybe they forgot to turn on release mode again?
 Marchete: I'll try LAHC instead Beam Search
 UndercoverToad: because your local computer is so much faster than ours
 Marchete: because why not
 reCurse: 10x doesn't sound right
 UndercoverToad: i saw some timeouts in IDE when I wanted to send an arena loss there
 UndercoverToad: while arena seems stable
 Nerchio: or well local 150k states in 68ms and CG 70k states 95ms
 Marchete: shrugs
 Nerchio: :p
 Marchete: I "just" need a good eval :rofl:
 UndercoverToad: ezpz
 ZarthaxX: -3*suns
 Marchete: thx ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: yw 
 ZarthaxX: what is LAHC btw? 
 Marchete: simulated annealing for dumbs
 reCurse: The physics thing
 ZarthaxX: so simpler?
 reCurse: Hadron Collider
 Marchete: lol
 ZarthaxX: wtf :rofl:
 Marchete: yes, simpler
 ZarthaxX: recurse still trolling in chat :P
 reCurse: :innocent:
 Marchete: it's like MC on steroids, not really good on search
 Marchete: but it's not hard to get it running
 ZarthaxX: are you really not participating?
 ZarthaxX: oh okey
 Marchete: I'm at my own pace
 ZarthaxX: interesting
 Marchete: it just took me 1 full week the sim
 ZarthaxX: oh iwas talking to recurse on that one haha
 Marchete: :D
 dbdr: I need a good eval too, Marchete
 ZarthaxX: but i get you, found a bug in sim yesterday
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Marchete: yeah, dbdr, sure
 UndercoverToad: give me ideas about opponent handling
 dbdr: mine is still crap
 ZarthaxX: how are you high then
 UndercoverToad: weed
 ZarthaxX: are there many tricks beside eval?
 ZarthaxX: damn
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Marchete: dbdr, see replays from top 5 and copy them
 Marchete: oh wait
 ZarthaxX: lol
 dbdr: :P
 reCurse: See replays where you lose and copy the opponent then
 RoboStac: yes, please do that so your bot is weaker&#160;:)
 Marchete: that's true, you can learn from losses
 Marchete: so improve
 dbdr: except it's not symmetric reCurse
 Marchete: I said that at first
 Marchete: sun isn't symmetric
 reCurse: Oh boy you're a needy one
 dbdr: :P
 reCurse: Alright, find replays where you lose matches on both sides
 reCurse: And copy what he did on whatever side
 dbdr: that said I see moves that are crap, that's not the problem
 Wontonimo: you could play your current bot against itself with x10 time limit (if it can use the extra time)
 Marchete: my idea dbdr
 UndercoverToad: but when you fix one thing, it breaks somewhere else
 Marchete: I don't mind to share
 Marchete: because I dont case
 Marchete: I see it as a management game
 reCurse: Sunforest Tycoon
 Marchete: maximize sun income, minimize costs, minimize enemy sun income
 dbdr: :D
 Wontonimo: nice
 Marchete: I'm serious, damn
 Marchete: I suck but maybe it's a thing
 AllYourTrees: M A X I M I Z E S C O R E
 Wontonimo: nope, maximize win
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2OcW_Hwkg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2OcW_Hwkg</a>
 AllYourTrees: def algorithm():
 Marchete: ok ok, I shut up then
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 AllYourTrees: no i agree with you Marchete
 AllYourTrees: lol dbdr
 reCurse: Don't mix up trolling with making fun of you
 AllYourTrees: yeah all i know how to do in this chat is troll
 Marchete: "Winning Strategy: Drive Fast"
 Wontonimo: lol dbdr ... love the onion
 AllYourTrees: so whatre ppl up to this weekend
 Wontonimo: coding
 Marchete: being in the chat instead of coding
 AllYourTrees: i'm going on vacation next week to the beach, pretty excited
 Marchete: Estimated end sun:72,78
 Marchete: DAY:23 TURN:32 Initial:78,72 
 Marchete: \o/
 aangairbender: dbdr how did you improve so much? better eval or another approach?
 Wontonimo: dbdr just hadn't revealed his true form before.  Don't know if he has 
 Marchete: having a bad eval that works good
 KalamariKing: Marchete jesus christ that's excessive
 solistice: So I started using bitarrays for performance reasons, I'm stuck now on how to count the number of seeds I currently have
 solistice: any tips in that direction?
 KalamariKing: keep an external counter
 aangairbender: Marchete why you are not in top10?
 KalamariKing: that's what I did
 solistice: that completely makes sense
 KalamariKing: much easier (and potentially faster) than all the calculating
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: can you find which tree a seed came from when calculating seeding positions with bitarrays?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: or you have to calculate tree by tree
 struct: dont think its possible
 struct: why just not check previous state and check which tree became dormant?
 struct: maybe im missunderstanding
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: its for simulating so I would need to change the tree to dormant manually
 UndercoverToad: that's a terrible map to find spawn locations <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554177091">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554177091</a>
 ddreams: cool map
 jrke: lots of 0 richness cells lol
 ddreams: seed=-1946968077413975040
 UndercoverToad: and at locations that make it hard not to place a tree in line of another tree even in the first few turns
 Marchete: that's a good eval too :rofl:
 Wontonimo: wow, my bot just falls apart on that map
 Wontonimo: thanks for sharing!
 UndercoverToad: falls apart in what way? let us see
 Marchete: euler sortedset has any use?
 ddreams: (almost) all data structures have their use
 KalamariKing: which ones do you say don't
 UndercoverToad: Lists are useless.Source: whoever created Pascal
 ddreams: all data structures except lists are uselessSource: whoever created Lisp
 Marchete:  :runner: Pascal
 aCat: PriorityQueues are useless: whoever created C# ^^'
 UndercoverToad: i remember who Marchete wanted to get the first in a language achievement and started with Pascal
 Marchete: 77% of my sim is movegen
 UndercoverToad: in the end he had a decent Dart bot
 Marchete: ended with Dart
 Marchete: it was a success
 Marchete: lang achievement
 UndercoverToad: turning in samples without analyzing
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: I have the reBless seed guesser replicated
 Marchete: never used it, but it was fun
 Marchete: so double blind analysis
 UndercoverToad: i wrote something similar during the contest - or tried at least. had the java random converted already but failed to use it to my advantage
 AntiSquid: groovy still up for those who need a language achievement :D
 Marchete: reCurs_e work was genious
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I'll take any achievement. How difficult is groovy?
 Marchete: I just did some tests on multi, like 10-20% guessed seeds
 AntiSquid: Objective C also available, nobody took it 
 Whiskee: ^yeah, for a reason
 kovi: can you guys guess seeding 10-20?&#160;;)
 Marchete: I had my badge, enough for "esoteric" languages
 MateoS: Hi guys. Im excausted and a bit out of ideas? Do you have some tips on how to decide when to cut first trees?
 Marchete: either C# for safenet or C++ for weeeee
 Hasuzawa: personally, I am most surprised there is no fortran to choose from
 MateoS: There seems to be battle a bit between those cutting early and those cutting late - if late cutters catch up to early cutters before end of the game
 UndercoverToad: we even have a D competitor this time
 AntiSquid: but TS and perl get you top 20
 Marchete: 2 guys with D
 Marchete: at gold
 UndercoverToad: i mean one around 50 (last time I checked)
 Marchete: unethical tip, reach legend and change to an language without anyone at legend, profit
 Marchete: a*
 struct: you can get disqualified
 UndercoverToad: i love my bot too much for this
 UndercoverToad: i think you are wrong struct
 reCurse: Legalize bot marriage
 UndercoverToad: back in the days when there were tshirts for the first in a language, you couldn't win by abusing the league system
 AntiSquid: is it not legal yet? surprised
 AntiSquid: people marry anime characters
 reCurse: I don't think that exploit works anymore
 reCurse: I vaguely recall Thibaud saying something about it
 reCurse: Or did they just stop giving prizes to language firsts?
 UndercoverToad: they explicitly disallowed it for tshirt
 UndercoverToad: no idea about language achievement
 reCurse: Oh, achievement, who gives a
 struct: ah
 struct: right
 cegprakash: when u have a bug and tweak all weights towards the bug now u fix that bug and everything falls apart
 struct: i have no idea in which language i placed top 3 tbh in a contest
 ddreams: Is a t-shirt so much different from an achievement tho
 struct: do hackathlon count?
 reCurse: Yes
 AntiSquid: yes ddreams
 UndercoverToad: you can't wear an achievement in real life
 UndercoverToad: it's just a useless flag on a server
 ddreams: I don't care much about either tbh, but I do like winning
 AntiSquid: with a t-shirt you can show it to your parents so they're proud of you
 aCat: or not
 aCat: cause you wasted time on some stupid ai games
 aCat: ;p
 AntiSquid: your parents don't like the tshirt aCat&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: my mom just reacts with "oh, it's black again"
 reCurse: Life is a waste of time
 aCat: that is complicated ;p
 Marchete: again =&gt; euler flexing
 UndercoverToad:&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: a tshirt for each day of the week
 Marchete: btw, how many tshirts?
 Marchete: 38?
 struct: 0
 Marchete: 0 for me too
 AntiSquid: from all contests or just CG&#160;?
 Wontonimo: ZarthaxX you have foiled me again! I will beat you next time! (or later this competition)
 reCurse: The 5% controls all the tshirt wealth!
 struct: all
 ddreams: I got a tshirt in an acm contest once
 Marchete: wait, no they sent me the mail once, and I just ignored it
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo haha :rofl: sure destroy me :P
 AntiSquid: i have 3 then 
 UndercoverToad: did your tech.io shirt ever arrive?
 UndercoverToad: or is it in Mexico now?
 Marchete: a thsirt was to mexico, never arrived or I never claimed
 Marchete: can't remember
 Marchete: tech.io gave better stuff
 Marchete: amazon gift cards or smth
 AntiSquid: was used to wrap smuggled drugs ^
 AntiSquid: so you won't see it again
 Marchete: yeah, there must be someone at customs with a CG tshirt...
 Wontonimo: wow, it's so tempting to just hang out on world chat and not actually code.... gotta close the window .... bbyyyyyyyeeeeeee
 Astrobytes: Cartel leader sitting in his mansion with a CG shirt on
 Marchete: flexing
 Marchete: "like my hero euler", they said
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: after shirt talk there's usually strategy talk about how to get them from contests Wontonimo, so stay a while and listen
 Wontonimo: lol
 Marchete: anyone have a good idea for better sorted lists/binary trees?
 Wontonimo: (is it just me, or does lol look like someone throwing their hands up in frustration?)
 reCurse: Why not both
 ddreams: sort a list twice for extra power
 AntiSquid: would have expected march to know that already he is quite knowledgeable
 ddreams: better for what
 AntiSquid: for speed
 Marchete: better =&gt; avoid full sorting as much as possible
 Wontonimo: pro tip&#160;: if you limit your list to 1 element you can use max() to sort
 Marchete: but nvm
 ddreams: implement your own red-black tree
 struct: why full sort?
 Marchete: C# doesn't have nth_
 struct: ah
 ddreams: so implement nth_element
 Marchete: do you guys have some attempt to keep diversity at beam search?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 Marchete: like try to be more diverse on initial move
 Marchete: because if not it ends up with the same "repeated" games
 reCurse: Sounds like a question for HR
 Wontonimo: oh, that's the second time i've heard that... interesting... diversity
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: don't know the right termn
 Wontonimo: thanks UndercoverToad for confirmation
 UndercoverToad: i have a GROW quota. at least 20% of the positions have to be taken by GROWs
 AntiSquid: why c# this contest Marchete&#160;?
 Marchete: dotnet 3.1 impressed me
 AntiSquid: noted toad
 Marchete: with some tests it was fast
 Wontonimo: binning by action(like) thing ... nice
 Marchete: but you can end up with a lot of candidates were all of them start with the same N moves?
 ddreams: why not?
 ddreams: it's very common
 Wontonimo: alright ... AntiSquid you've successfully sucked me into another 10 min of chat, but i'm gone now.  cya
 miszu: good morning children
 ddreams: good morning child
 ClockSort: hi miszu, nice work reaching top 500
 miszu: ClockSort thank you&#160;:)
 miszu: I am pretty proud of myself. Those are my last efforts. This weekend there is a chess tournament in Canada that I want to participate
 miszu: So I won't have time to code
 ClockSort: nice. I am in Google Code Jam Round 2 this weekend, which will take some time too.
 DomiKo: yap yap
 reCurse: Isn't that just online because of covid?
 ClockSort: finals are (probably) online, but Round 2 is always online
 ZarthaxX: always has been right?
 ZarthaxX: excepto for final, but thats online too
 reCurse: I was talking about the chess thing sorry
 miszu: reCurse yeah but there are strict rules like you need 2 cameras for zoom and stuff like that.
 miszu: it's the Quebec organization that do it
 reCurse: Oh ok
 Vova_s: hi, I have found that it is possible to use my IDE for contest. Does anyone know if it is possible to retreave step data in my IDE? 
 miszu: I know you play chess so maybe you could give it a try?&#160;:)
 ClockSort: what is "step data"?
 reCurse: Hahaha
 Vova_s: I want to have a possibility to debug...
 ddreams: Help, step data, I'm stuck
 AntiSquid: you can setup offline lol
 reCurse: No I'm garbage at it but thanks for the offer
 ClockSort: I don't think the Codingame IDE has a debugger.
 ClockSort: I'm not garbage at chess.
 ClockSort: @miszu want to play?
 miszu: sure we can blitz
 UndercoverToad: ClockSort 04:27PMnice. I am in Google Code Jam Round 2 this weekend, which will take some time too.
 miszu: do you have chess.com account?
 UndercoverToad: do you have the same nickname on codejam as here?
 reCurse: Give link to game
 ClockSort: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lichess.org/FE3qZZmk">https://lichess.org/FE3qZZmk</a>
 ddreams: lichess is much nicer
 AntiSquid: hate that ... why do people love blitz? what's wrong with 30 mins / 1 h game? 
 ClockSort: @UndercoverToad yes
 ClockSort: @miszu here's a lichess link
 DomiKo: AntiSquid too long
 reCurse: Stronger contrast between player strength
 ClockSort: @miszu are you huspau?
 miszu: yeah
 AntiSquid: either you like chess or you don't . there's no too long
 reCurse: I prefer 10+5 to blitz personally though
 ClockSort: ok gl hf :D
 miszu: gl hf
 UndercoverToad: with that nickname you must have liked round 1B problem A, didn't you?
 UndercoverToad: I hated it btw
 AntiSquid: not necessarily, for blitz you need to memorize openings 
 reCurse: Oh huspau = miszu? I'm not too far from that level actually
 reCurse: Like ~1700 lichess
 ddreams: sameish
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad you passed right?
 UndercoverToad: yes, around 250 in 1B
 ZarthaxX: wow, nice!
 ZarthaxX: was it hard?
 UndercoverToad: the tasks were doable
 UndercoverToad: one was bruteforce. it just took me a bit to realize that it works
 RoboStac: the third part of A was nasty
 UndercoverToad: so i solved a corner case with math that could have been bruteforced too
 ZarthaxX: you didnt check constraints at the moment i guess
 UndercoverToad: the annoying clock and large integers
 UndercoverToad: i didn't even feel like trying it after i passed the other tasks
 UndercoverToad: i checked constraints but thought the solution numbers would be bigger
 UndercoverToad: turned out you could just test everything up to 1000 and pass with ease
 UndercoverToad: i found some CGD formula to prove if it's unsolvable
 DomiKo: very nice
 reCurse: Nice game
 ClockSort: that's "how to win a draw"
 ddreams: gg
 UndercoverToad: then I was sitting there like "now i probably need binary search. But I can't start with any number as some will work and others won't"
 AntiSquid: trade trade trade ... what most folks do in blitz ... lol win by time
 miszu: gg
 ddreams: sorted him out with the clock
 miszu: time pressure killed me
 UndercoverToad: so I did the interactive task first and then just ran my solution from the small testcase on the large one to see it succeed
 reCurse: It takes a lot more skill than that AntiSquid
 UndercoverToad: and the interactive had some randomness in generation and my solution was somewhere around the limit that you needed
 reCurse: I completely crumble in 3+0 where I do fine in 10+5
 UndercoverToad: I submitted 6 times the same code until I passed
 struct: I also cant play 3+0
 ddreams: Play a few hundred 1-0
 miszu: tbh 3+0 I am very bad at it. I do 15+10 which is the tournament standard this weekend
 AntiSquid: 1500 rating blitz 
 ClockSort: don't feel bad, I am ~2000 on lichess&#160;:)
 miszu: HOLLY
 AntiSquid: im not a pro but ...
 ddreams: gj then
 miszu: 2k is a good rating
 AntiSquid: 2k in what ClockSort?
 miszu: I'll analyse the game and see my blunders
 ClockSort: @antisquid chess rating of about 2000
 StyllyMyle: guys
 StyllyMyle: why std::find giving me error
 ddreams: 1715 blitz here
 ZarthaxX: UndercoverToad 6 times? man that penalty
 reCurse: Make sure to specify lichess or chesscom, the distribution is quite different
 ddreams: lichess
 miszu: lichess you rating is a bit higher
 reCurse: Only at the lower levels
 AntiSquid: ok but he is 1500 and you win by time, when it's almost a draw? i would expect more with 500 gap
 miszu: chess.com is more close to what FIDE and other federations do
 UndercoverToad: i take the penalty if I get 20 juicy points in return
 UndercoverToad: looking at the scoreboard I wasn't the only one doing this
 ddreams: he would likely have won the endgame there
 ClockSort: @AntiSquid you sound like my monte carlo, trying to "win by more points" as if it were better :D
 AntiSquid: how different is lichess and chess.com&#160;?
 reCurse: Different rating curve
 reCurse: I had a google sheet somewhere
 miszu: if anyone is interested in the analysis: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lichess.org/FE3qZZmk/white#84">https://lichess.org/FE3qZZmk/white#84</a>
 reCurse: One sec
 ddreams: completely free
 StyllyMyle: wth
 StyllyMyle: huys
 AntiSquid: you missunderstand, generally would expect 2k RP to know openings better and how to react to trades / lower RP
 StyllyMyle: someone please tell me why cant i use std::fing here
 reCurse: So for rapid, 600 chesscom = 1200 lichess
 StyllyMyle: i did import algoritm module
 StyllyMyle: std::fing
 StyllyMyle: find
 reCurse: But then 1600 chesscom = 2100 lichess
 reCurse: And the spread diminishes
 ddreams: StyllyMyle, when you ask for help about an error, include the error message instead of spamming
 StyllyMyle: ddreams ok

 AntiSquid: 1900++ forgot exact ranking on chess.com, how does that compare to lichess, did mix of anything from 15 minutes upwards 
 reCurse: Around 2200-2300
 reCurse: Roughly, it's harder to translate because of much lower percentile
 AntiSquid: for real? 
 ddreams: StyllyMyle std::find takes iterators
 AntiSquid: i would expect 2200 - 2300 to be pro on chess.com O_O
 StyllyMyle: if (std::find(trees.begin(), trees.end(), &amp;tre)&#160;!= trees.end())
 miszu: 2200 in chess.com you are a master level
 StyllyMyle: if (std::find(trees.begin(), trees.end(), &amp;tre)&#160;!= trees.end()){
 reCurse: 1900 chesscom = 2200-2300 lichess is what I meant
 miszu: official master title have that rating
 miszu: maybe 2400
 reCurse: I'm also using rapid distribution
 AntiSquid: ya that's why i am surprised by the difference
 StyllyMyle: Anything wrong in that code? trees is Tree class object vector and &amp;tre is pointer to my treee
 reCurse: The biggest problem is chesscom gives all time distribution
 reCurse: And lichess gives recent distribution
 reCurse: So it's possible the translation isn't the best
 ddreams: do you have pointers in your vector?
 ddreams: if not, then don't try to find a pointer
 StyllyMyle: Wait shit
 StyllyMyle: Yea
 StyllyMyle: Basically it was my mistake
 StyllyMyle: but its giving another err
 reCurse: I'm just mapping percentiles dumbly

 ddreams: what's the definition of trees?
 Astrobytes: what's a tree?
 miszu: if you want to improve in chess, doing puzzles is the way to go

 Astrobytes: An int or a Tree instance?
 ddreams: Astrobytes it's kind of a big plant that grows in the forest
 StyllyMyle: Yea tree is your simple class object
 StyllyMyle: Tree is class

 ddreams: error: no match for ‘operator==’ (operand types are ‘Tree’ and ‘const Tree’)
 StyllyMyle: Whoa
 StyllyMyle: Bruh
 StyllyMyle: Im idiot
 AntiSquid: maybe chess with random start would have been a more fun contest
 ddreams: I saw Carlsen and Hikaru live playing the fischer chess world championship
 ddreams: was fun
 ddreams: err
 ddreams: not hikaru
 AntiSquid: anand?
 AntiSquid: he Final Match! || Carlsen vs Wesley So || World Fischer Random Championship (2019) GAME 1  ? this&#160;?
 ddreams: actually, it was Hikaru in 2018
 AntiSquid: isn't 2019 the first official one?
 reCurse: I think random chess may be more interesting to computers than humans
 reCurse: But shrug
 ddreams: I think it's more interesting because there's less focus on preparation/memorization of opening
 ddreams: s
 reCurse: I heard good players comment on how some random openings were broken
 ddreams: that's why they always play both sides
 reCurse: Ah, right.
 reCurse: Missed that thanks
 reCurse: Still a point though
 reCurse: You play both sides on UTTT but it's still a broken game

 reCurse: Pervert
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: alright afk, back later
 Nerchio: cya astro
 Digginwings: lets go
 Nerchio: btw guys a tip
 Nerchio: if you dont look at last battles history you usually win more
 Nerchio: during a submit
 AntiSquid: lol
 Nerchio: idk maybe it helps someone
 ClockSort: i found that if you don't submit your bot then you can imagine it doing really well!
 struct: if you dont submit you cant lose
 Smelty: wait wHat
 reCurse: Schrodinger's submit
 Smelty: well i was watching my bot and it won the first 17 battles, so-
 Smelty: but then again now it lost a ton so
 Nerchio: rip
 Nerchio: now its too late you already looked at it
 Smelty: oh no
 Smelty: better resub
 AntiSquid: where are you laptop cat&#160;?
 Smelty: h-hi mr antisquid
 AntiSquid: ah still silver
 Smelty:&#160;:(
 Smelty: im getting close though, top 100
 AntiSquid: go go laptop cat&#160;!
 Smelty: i've already consistently beaten the boss but i lose against other s
 Smelty: :0 thanks
 Ajaiy2: My past code was on ~950
 Smelty: length or rank
 Ajaiy2: Rank
 Smelty: ah
 AntiSquid: if you promote everyone above you you can wreck boss and promote lol
 Smelty: lol
 Ajaiy2: But code is &lt;400
 Smelty: i literally won the first 17 battles-
 Smelty: my code is 822
 Smelty: 100 lines of code is dedicated to messages
 Smelty: im gonna toggle around some scorings and hope that it will improvE
 WolfDarrigan: I've found you typically only lose the first 10 battles if your bot crashes
 WolfDarrigan: Pretty sure it starts you off at the bottom of the league then does some ELO magic to place you
 AntiSquid: how much do the messages slow down your bot Smelty&#160;?
 Smelty: well its performing regularly 0-1 millis so i dont think time is a problem
 reCurse: It samples every 10% of the leaderboard for the first 10 matches
 Smelty: really?
 Smelty: i won all first 10-
 reCurse: Then uses that to give your starting score
 WolfDarrigan: oooh, interesting
 Smelty: yes, very interesting
 Ajaiy2: OoOOooOO
 Hasuzawa: because well the rank itself is a sorting algorithm
 ClockSort: I am exceedingly interested.
 Smelty: alr imma double the score bonuses for knight moves and seee what happens
 reCurse: This is only based off years of empirical observation
 ClockSort: I often lose the first n and win the first 10-n matches
 Smelty: lol
 reCurse: Exact algorithm has never been given out
 Smelty: brev now my bot is tryna spam knight moves
 ClockSort: consecutively, I mean. Which supports the idea of incremental opponent percentile bands
 Smelty: interesting. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554270312">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554270312</a>
 Smelty: red gives double the bonus for knight moves compared to blue
 Smelty: more testing is needed to validate if it is actuallly better
 Ajaiy2: Frame 116
 Smelty: yes?
 Ajaiy2: Did you just...?
 Smelty:&#160;?
 Smelty: also my bot is playing based on the hueristics i gave it
 Smelty: i don't actually know a good strat

 Nerchio: there's a certain pattern in this game
 Smelty: e?
 Nerchio: the more stupid bugs and the dumber my evaluation i rank higher
 Smelty: confused
 Nerchio: don't ask me i don't understand either :D
 reCurse: Quick add more bugs
 Smelty: y'know what, im submitting my knight-crazy ai

 AntiSquid: here's another one for you Nerchio: randomly add your sun count to your opponent sun count for the eval :D
 Smelty: LOL
 Smelty: randomly sell your trees based on a random number  generator
 Nerchio: AntiSquid that might actually work :astonished:
 ClockSort: @smelty I'm doing that and it's currently rank 164
 ClockSort: randomly selling your trees seems to be nearly optimal play
 Cjx_1: tell the bot the game ends 2 days earlier :P
 Smelty: clock lol
 Smelty: cjx lol
 Cjx_1: gotta really mess with these blasted spirits lol
 ClockSort: set richness=0 for all cells. that might help
 Smelty: such smart
 ClockSort: because the center isn't as good as it seems
 Smelty: welp my knight move algo doesnt really care about them nutrients no more
 Chainman: debugging this&#160;:((((
 Smelty: F
 Cjx_1: anyone one find much success focusing on offensive or defensive play, or is everyone mostly focusing on self optimizing?
 Smelty: or you can add more bugs
 ClockSort: noobs debug. pros rebug.
 Cjx_1: ^^
 Cjx_1: add features
 Chainman: :innocent:
 Smelty: Cjx_1: i focus on attacking with knights
 Smelty: and other sh
 Ajaiy2: I decide to go safe and optimize my previously "messy" code
 ClockSort: see if you can promote your knight to a queen
 Smelty: o.o
 Smelty: yea thats real smart clockk
 Smelty: lemme google
 Smelty: "Can you promote knights in Photosynthesis"
 Ajaiy2: NO
 ClockSort: it took me two days to notice that knights can't move on hexagonal boards
 Smelty: LMAO
 Smelty: i do one in each direction
 reCurse: hex chess :thinking:

 Chainman: I'm trying to grow dormant trees&#160;:(
 Smelty: Chainman good bug!
 LLG: I scrapped my beam search and wrote a quick if/else bot in 30 minutes
 Smelty: only add them to your array of candidates if they are not dormant
 Smelty: llg o.O
 LLG: let's see this one get gold before my beam search does
 Chainman: You mean feature
 Smelty: rebug, my friend, rebug
 LLG: imagine  writing if/else bot with bitboards lol
 Smelty: me who has a scoring depth 1 if/else bot
 Ajaiy2: Which might just be the thing I am doing right now
 Ajaiy2: @LLG
 Smelty: c a y g h t
 LLG: I already had bitboards from my beam search bot
 LLG: I had a BeamSearch class that has a Run method, which returns a Move
 Smelty: lol
 LLG: so I just commented the whole class out
 LLG: wrote an IfElse class that has a FindBestMove method which returns a Move
 LLG: then plug it in the same place
 LLG: already performing better than my old bot lmao
 Smelty: tbh without comments showing me what is what i would have 0 idea what my code is doing
 Smelty: it has been confirmed; my bot likes triangulating

 LLG: what the heck is my if/else bot doing
 LLG: and it still won lmao
 Smelty: lmao
 Smelty: i recommend that you do not plant next to urself
 Nerchio: very impressive bot
 pmor: LLG, I'm about to do the same.  My beamsearch is horrid.
 Smelty: also if my bot has 0 sim and tons of if/else does it count as if/else
 LLG: pmor, yeah, my beam search can't go really deep nor wide
 Smelty: methinks you stole the nutrients llg
 LLG: and my eval is bad
 BlitzProg: I'm trying to add more if/else things to check, but I'm running out of ideas
 BlitzProg: am 230 gold
 Smelty: wHat
 ClockSort: try using else/if instead of if/else
 Ajaiy2: Nope, if else did not work for me
 Smelty: *cries in 300 silver*
 Smelty: clock thats a great idea
 Maliamnon: 77% and #9 in silver. What are my chances?
 Maliamnon:&#160;:)
 Ajaiy2: Never thought I would go into the pit of beamsearch

 Smelty: lol
 LLG: and it still performed better than my beam search
 LLG: idek
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: poor beam search
 ClockSort: `i==19` should never exist in any code ever
 Smelty: why not
 ClockSort: too magical
 Smelty: i have it in my code like 4 times
 Smelty: if (i==19 || i==22 || i==25 || i==28 || i==31 || i==34) {
 ClockSort: :laughing:
 Smelty: basically if corner give point
 LLG: why don't make a collection of corners
 LLG: then if corners.contains(i)
 Ajaiy2: You could have just written (i - 19)&#160;% 3 == 0 &amp;&amp; (i - 19) &gt; 0
 LLG: to save yourself some headache
 Smelty: too lazy
 ClockSort: put those values in a vector. then... for(auto&amp; v&#160;: vec) if(i==v) score+=6;
 Maliamnon: or just the number of 'can't be interrupted' sun directions
 Smelty: lolz
 ClockSort: it would be nice to have all the corners in a vector, eh? seems like you could use that in a couple places.
 Smelty: too lazy to write
 Maliamnon: gotta account for the orange layer being all grey you know
 Smelty: jsut like i dont write a neighbor calc
 ClockSort: I made a vector of vector of vectors of all the distances any tile can reach from any tile
 Smelty: nice
 Nerchio: :fearful:
 Smelty: i have a for loop in a for loop in a for loop in a for loop to eval if its a valid move

 LLG: competing with a few coworkers and some of them are in top 100 gold
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/DX9m6J.jpg">https://snipboard.io/DX9m6J.jpg</a>
 LLG: monkaS
 WolfDarrigan: if (!giveUp(you) &amp;&amp; !letDown(you) &amp;&amp; !runAroundAndDesert(you))
 Smelty: im losing ranks, in 800 now&#160;:(
 actualCoderTrevor: lol
 actualCoderTrevor: Hey me too
 Smelty: wolf yes my bot has monty python, quotes, and rickroll
 Michael_Howard: Smelty ClockSort why are corners better?
 Smelty: *by quotes i mean rick and morty
 WolfDarrigan: I saw that, it is majestic
 Smelty: Michael cuz they can have sun 3 days outta 6 at min
 Maliamnon: your bot really likes those edges, huh Smelty?
 LLG: I'm above silver boss
 LLG: gold here I come
 Smelty: Malia perhaps
 Smelty: it likes triangulating 
 Smelty: llg u just got noped-
 LLG: lmao
 LLG: I'm at 26%
 LLG: so I'll prob be fine
 Smelty: o
 LLG: my bot does really badly on the board with 2 massive unusable patch of soil
 pmor: LLG youre really convincing me to go if/else...but I really want to know why my beamsearch is so bad&#160;:(
 LLG: I lost 3 times to Konstanta
 LLG: rip
 Konstanta: :grin: 
 Smelty: F
 LLG: if anything I could just leave my bot at top 10 silver and get pushed to gold
 LLG: like I did last year
 struct: its the wise choice
 Queuebee: why can i only increment an int 500k times in a while loop in C# in 100mswhen struct can sim 1M+ games in 100ms
 struct: increment an int 500k times?
 struct: something is wrong lol
 Hugo-NL: :O
 Queuebee: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35987735-0eed-4453-958a-ecad69978811">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35987735-0eed-4453-958a-ecad69978811</a>
 Queuebee: ignore whatever the text says 
 struct: you are checking time every iteration
 struct: thats expensive
 Queuebee: a
 Queuebee: that makes a whole lot of sense
 Queuebee: thanks Lol
 pmor: 1M+?!?
 Smelty: ok thats it im making my bot less craz
 Queuebee: do you then check time only every&#160;?? 50k sims? but then you'd have to mod  50k your amtofsims every iteration
 Nerchio: struct im checking time when processing every state if I run out of time
 Nerchio: its bad?
 struct: you dont want to check every state
 struct: do it like N states
 Nerchio: is it better to do count&#160;% 50 == 0 &amp;&amp; timecheck?
 alchemsti: yes
 alchemsti: :D
 alchemsti: checking time takes some time
 LLG: modulo is cheaper than getting the current time yes
 struct: (number of states &amp; 4000) == 0 &amp;&amp; checktme
 alchemsti: You don't need to be that precise you should give yourself a little buffer
 Nerchio: ok cool
 Nerchio: i will do that although will not change my bot too much
 Queuebee: is mod more expensive than &amp;
 miszu: I thought modulo is expensive
 Queuebee: or is it just a synonym
 struct: modulo is less expensive than  checking time
 struct: I use modulo on shadows
 alchemsti: any simple math operation is pretty cheap
 struct: and its fast 
 Smelty: yes.
 miszu: I remember in UTTT you try to avoid modulus when you can
 struct: bench/repeats:20_mean         12.9 ns         12.9 ns           20bench/repeats:20_median       12.8 ns         12.8 ns           20
 alchemsti: (mod, &amp;)
 Queuebee: I'm trying to put my trees in uints, one for each size and then 2 for each player but now idk how to make them grow l0l
 RoboStac: mod to a constant is usually optimised to something much better too
 alchemsti: I don't know what UTTT is but there's usually not a lot of reason to avoid module
 alchemsti: modulus
 miszu: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
 miszu: the OG for MCTS and optimization
 Smelty: e
 Smelty: llg be close
 Smelty: to promote
 LLG: I've been around top 10 since 15%
 LLG: it's now 52%
 miszu: breaking the top 100 is super difficult now
 LLG: I consistently lose to Konstanta
 miszu: masochism level
 LLG: if Konstanta get boosted up I have a high chance of going up as well
 LLG: I only lose to him and sometimes the boss
 LLG: I just saw my bot cut every tree on turn 17 in IDE
 LLG: maybe I should write another if to prevent that lmao
 LLG: I should also make my bot say something
 LLG: maybe the bee movie script
 Queuebee: oh my lord the optimization on&#160;% is insane with constants LOL
 miszu: struct only 20 pos difference&#160;;)
 struct: maybe I should stop chatting and start coding
 Smelty: yes code more bugs
 LLG: was there a win rate checker anywhere?
 LLG: I vaguely remember seeing it in chat
 mpoo: Any idea why I might not be able to join the Discord (I get "Unable to accept invite")
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/</a>
 LLG: I want to see my 0% winrate against the boss lmao
 LLG: ty Robo
 RoboStac: might not pick you up if you aren't in gold
 LLG: yeah I'm not in top 1k rn
 Roxxx: hello world!&#160;;)
 mpoo: You must be eager to go gold LLG, I saw you at the top of silver.
 LLG: I'm gold now
 LLG: I also got a bug where it said I was top 2 gold
 mpoo: yeah, you just disappeared. congrats!
 LLG: when I was promoted and my medal updated, but not my rank
 struct: rank only updates daily
 miszu: struct do you use the number of trees of certain size in your heuristics?
 struct: heuristic?
 miszu: eval
 struct: yes
 struct: but my eval is simple
 struct: I dont take into account shadowing myself
 miszu: right
 miszu: I haven't use frequency yet
 miszu: I hope it will help bump my score a bit
 King_Coda: KalamariKing
 King_Coda: Where are you KalamariKing
 King_Coda: I'm going to ping you as much as possible KalamariKing
 King_Coda: Fine I'll just message you then, KalamariKing
 elderlybeginner: anyone eager to point my bot weaknesses?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/554348380">https://www.codingame.com/replay/554348380</a>
 elderlybeginner: I'm out of ideas what can be fixed
 UndercoverToad: can I get mean?
 RoboStac: is opponent choice a weakness?
 actualCoderTrevor: Mean and green
 UndercoverToad: db dr doesn't even place the first tree near the center, wow
 aangairbender: I dont get why dbdr is not the 1st place
 UndercoverToad: he is
 aangairbender: I meant why he is 1st place
 aangairbender: I watch his games and I dont see anything special
 reCurse: Rude
 KCrown: UndercoverToad&#160;! u were like 4th last night ... what happened?
 dbdr: I carefully hide my strat&#160;;)
 aangairbender: thats really how master should do
 UndercoverToad: others are getting stronger and I run out of ideas
 UndercoverToad: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 dbdr: UndercoverToad why would the center be better?
 aangairbender: nobody should understand where that strength comes from:joy:
 UndercoverToad: and codejam on Saturday, why don't I just dump this contest?
 UndercoverToad: because of the richness
 KCrown: and dbdr is hidng his ideas? :P 
 aangairbender: dbdr do you still have beam search?
 kovi: dbdr to chop early and get more points
 Whatar: I would say that you also cast more harming shadows if you have tree in the center
 Whatar: *trees
 UndercoverToad: but also receive
 RoboStac: yeah, but he has more sun and still gets a t3 tree in the middle by day 7 which is well before it would be chopped
 Whatar: true UndercoveredToad
 Whatar: you are not chopping the tree, you are completing his life cycle
 KCrown: i have a pretty good idea of hwo to sedd and grow ... but for chopping its basically random&#160;:( 
 Whatar: very important 
 KCrown: chopping at the end works sorta ... choping after the other guys chops sorta works too ... but I don't have a good idea other than that 
 miszu: and dbdr is winning by a lot. He has almost 2 pts true score
 miszu: difference
 UndercoverToad: elderlybeginner i don't even see anything really horrible from your bot. except the endgame where you upgrade to a size 3 tree directly before the game ends (2 points lost)
 struct: dbdr is first because he did yavalath
 UndercoverToad: the trees at 17 and 30 aren't perfect
 elderlybeginner: this contest is all about tiny equilibriums, cost and incomes
 reCurse: So where is MSmits then :thinking:
 UndercoverToad: the maps are too random, he can't book the opening
 reCurse: His kryptonite
 elderlybeginner: UndercoverToad that's what bothers me - I don't see any big mistakes, would be easier it there is something obvious. I will look into endgame thou
 dbdr: struct my yavalath is weak
 struct: I think the game had a lot less richness 0 cells during testing
 UndercoverToad: or share another game on a different map
 struct: I know dbdr, I just wanted to advertise
 UndercoverToad: and with a less cruel opponent
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 aangairbender: I have a feeling that there is a better approach than beam search
 UndercoverToad: probably there are
 aangairbender: it is basically greedy algo
 UndercoverToad: i just don't see the approach or lack the skill to pull it off
 struct: Is Illedan still participating?
 dbdr: it's not greedy
 aangairbender: with beam size 30 its pretty greedy:joy:
 dbdr: greedy is best move at depth1
 elderlybeginner: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/554358461">https://www.codingame.com/replay/554358461</a>me (330) against (100) went horrible - this can be material for analysing
 dbdr: width 1&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: yep 1 :P
 UndercoverToad: i see that you get your first lvl3 tree very early on
 aangairbender: I dont know how to make eval for not planting seed when its not good, I mean planting seed should give some profit in future, but maybe its better to wait 1 day and seed in a lot better spot
 Ajaiy2: Im really happy with my neighbor searching algorithm using recursion and greedy algorithm
 UndercoverToad: and sell it in round 7 already
 UndercoverToad: that's way too soon
 ClockSort: round 7 is guaranteed too soon
 KalamariKing: King_Coda I ran away
 RoboStac: elderlybeginner - you fall way behind on sun generation (by day 12 you have gathered 59 sun to his 84)
 UndercoverToad: even when it was 2 turns away from casting shadow to the opponent
 KalamariKing: King_Coda but I am back now
 KalamariKing: King_Coda I saw your dms thanks
 KalamariKing: King_Coda
 elderlybeginner: yes, have the same observation, growing 3 and complating is over-factored
 King_Coda: LOL dude we're literally in dm's right now
 UndercoverToad: oh, robo doing stats that aren't shown
 KalamariKing: King_Coda it appears we are
 elderlybeginner: i think I have to implement future shadow influence into scoring as well
 aangairbender: anybody wanna share his beam width one again?
 aangairbender: cause I am losing confidence
 UndercoverToad: 40
 KalamariKing: i think Nerc​hio was using like 200 or smth
 aangairbender: I tried 30-50, have 30 in arena now
 aangairbender: tuning the eval functions is so boring
 aangairbender: I am even thinking about returning to heuristics bot:grimacing:
 UndercoverToad: that's even more boring
 UndercoverToad: if it wasn't a contest, i would have left the game 3 days ago
 aangairbender: I wanna make it to the legend during contest at least once
 Ajaiy2: Me too
 UndercoverToad: that's also my goal
 aangairbender: haven't you?
 UndercoverToad: i always want to reach legend
 aangairbender: day before this contest started, I writed MCTS for uttt and it went straight to the legend from bronze. No extra tuning/heuristics/teccles
 UndercoverToad: that one was a nightmare for me, i'm bad at performance tuning
 aangairbender: I was lucky, there was need to work on performance in my case
 aangairbender: rust doest its job
 aangairbender: does*
 aangairbender: was no need*
 Smelty: ugh rank 15, so close
 aangairbender: my fingers are broken after fulltime typing the code jeez
 miszu: I implemented a check so that I don't waste my grow moves on tree at the end of the game and I sitll have 50% win rate with my submitted bot
 ClockSort: it's so difficult to tell what is an improvement
 miszu: in theory it is an improvement
 KCrown: ok time to submit hoping to get to about ~300 
 ClockSort: my new bot lost 9 out of 10 vs the old one
 miszu: don't grow trees that will be impossible to chop chop
 miszu: KCrown come get me bro
 ClockSort: then it won 9 out of 20. it ended ahead 26 to 24
 miszu: I am 343
 ClockSort: i'm 196 now, dropped 30 ranks in an hour without a resubmit
 Smelty: lol.
 Smelty: *F
 Smelty: sighs i still can't promote so close though
 Smelty: 17
 miszu: Smelty which league?
 ClockSort: smelty if you wait long enough it'll happen randomly :D
 ClockSort: when they opened gold I was 200th place silver. I did nothing, and an hour later I was promoted.
 miszu: submitting now. Hoping that new logic will do wonders
 XeroOl: can everyone please let me into gold, thanks in advance
 miszu: BossBoot: You shall not pass
 miszu: *throws seeds*
 ClockSort: Fly, you fools! *falls into forest*
 KCrown: well it must have been buggy seemed to have lost 300 ranks lol 
 Ajaiy2: Yes! My greedy algorithm doesn't have any bugs at first try!
 Smelty: rank 7....slowly creeping up
 miszu: BossBoot is getting nervous
 miszu: or w/e his name
 Smelty: bossoot is silver boi
 miszu: Bossoot gonna do his magic tricks
 Smelty: imma spam battles vs him to bring him down&#160;:)
 XeroOl: boss out of time
 Smelty: brev just beat boss by almst 30 points

 miszu: GG
 Smelty: eep just lost
 Ajaiy2: What is your average points, Smelty?
 Smelty: ~120-130
 KCrown: well good news is the logs caught the error ... now I have to figure out why this var is 0 when it shouldn't be :P 
 Smelty: edit: 115-140
 Smelty: and can go up to 170
 Chainman: This is a bug day for me
 Smelty: rebug good debug bad
 Ajaiy2: This is a bugless day for me
 Chainman: Now I'm seeding where my opponent is at lol
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: i save possible moves in array and compare them to see if its valid
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 Chainman: and apparently that sets you to wait automatically for that day.
 <b>**Ajaiy2 has been saved by bitarrays</b></p><p><img src="/a/62842162200886" /> <b>**Smelty has been killed by bitarray</b></p><p><img src="/a/46863582565465" /> Chainman: *how
 Ajaiy2: Why tho
 Chainman: I did bits something
 Chainman: well the problem was I wasn't updating my opponent arrays every day.
 Smelty: lmao oof
 XeroOl: is anybody good at rust
 Smelty: w
 Smelty: die boss die
 XeroOl: I've hit one of those rust problems
 Smelty: im literally behind by only 0.5
 XeroOl: I guess I need to go to the rust discord
 Smelty: oof
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554384125">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/554384125</a>
 aangairbender: XeroOI you can ask. What rust problem?
 Smelty: yes
 XeroOl: right now my function signature is this:fn validActions(self: &amp;Self) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = Action&gt; {
 Smelty: yees
 XeroOl: and I don't know how to do that syntactically
 Smelty: this might help <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30422177/how-do-i-write-an-iterator-that-returns-references-to-itself">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30422177/how-do-i-write-an-iterator-that-returns-references-to-itself</a>
 Smelty: idk though
 KCrown: size0 size0 size0 size0 
 KCrown: should be size0 size1 size2 abd size3
 XeroOl: it's not yielding references to itself
 XeroOl: the moves aren't stored anywhere and I'm not returning references @smelty
 Smelty: h m m 
 Smelty: i have no idea about rust, sorry
 KCrown: ok cleared unit testing ... resummitting ... I dont know about you but Im sorta excited
 aangairbender: so why you need to return reference?
 aangairbender: and you can writefn validActions(&amp;self)instead of fn validActions(self: &amp;Self)
 Smelty: o.O
 XeroOl: oh you just saved me a bunch of time lol
 XeroOl: I want to return an iterator that generates the valid actions
 Chainman: My bot just seeds and waits lolol
 XeroOl: but that iterator needs the lifetime to be tied to &amp;self
 Smelty:&#160;;
 ddreams: It's spreading its wild oats, Mr. Chainman
 ddreams: it's just a phase
 Smelty: lol
 aangairbender: XeroIO it can be either lifetime of &amp;self or lifetime of the function itself
 XeroOl: how do I set it to either?
 XeroOl: I just don't know syntactically where to put the lifetime on an impl return type
 Smelty: herrrm
 King_Coda: "There is only so much in the tank" -KalamariKing
 aangairbender: XeroOl <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=03e2993a85d7a955cab7130dca4c99e3">https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=03e2993a85d7a955cab7130dca4c99e3</a>
 aangairbender: why you need lifetime for Iterator abyway?
 XeroOl: my iterator is more complicated
 aangairbender: which type of Iterator do you have?
 XeroOl: I'm using std::iter::from_fn
 XeroOl: and I've got a closure that pulls in a reference to some of &amp;self's fields
 aangairbender: then of course you need lifetime of self
 aangairbender: wait a minute
 XeroOl: yeah I know that, I just don't know the syntax
 XeroOl: `impl Iterator&lt;'a, Item = Action&gt;` didn't work
 miszu: well my rank didn't move by a bit lol
 Smelty: aaaaa rank 3
 XeroOl: aha, the rust discord helped me with the syntac
 Smelty: if i gain one rank ill be above the boss-
 aangairbender: impl&lt;'a&gt;&#160;?
 miszu: eulerscheZahl grats being top 10 again
 XeroOl: it's -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;..&gt; + 'a
 Smelty: o.O
 aangairbender: oh I see
 XeroOl: I would have never guessed it's a +
 XeroOl: well, they told me '_
 XeroOl: and the compiler can infer what lifetime to put, since there's only a &amp;self in the arguments
 aangairbender: nice
 XeroOl: problem solved, thank you very much
 aangairbender: its so much easier in c# lol
 aangairbender: just return IEnumerable&lt;Action&gt;and call yield new Action(..) inside
 XeroOl: yeah, yield would simplify the logic here too lolk
 aangairbender: year ago I tried to use from_fn to generate actions and it didn't work for me
 XeroOl: I have to use like a state machine
 Smelty: huh
 aangairbender: to play a random action I need to obtain all of them, so no difference to iter then collect or just push them to vec
 aangairbender: Smelty rust is fun
 XeroOl: yeah maybe I should be doing that lol
 XeroOl: that would make things a lot easier
 XeroOl: I was just thinking that I could collect later, but it's hard to go from vec to iterator
 XeroOl: so I might as well do it the cool way first
 aangairbender: just do some mut vec and provide enough capacity for not moving content around
 aangairbender: (I dont do that yet tell to do so lol)
 XeroOl: I'm fairly sure the iterator will use less memory since it never lists out all the actiuns
 XeroOl: but I have no idea how much a closure costs, so who knows
 aangairbender: but how you know amount of actions?
 aangairbender: you need to do iter.count()
 XeroOl: you could just iterate twice lol
 XeroOl: stupid slow, but saves memory
 aangairbender: iterate twice means apply action calculation logic twice
 XeroOl: either that or iter.collect()
 XeroOl: into a vec
 aangairbender: I would go for generatig actions only once for the sake of perfomance
 XeroOl: surely it's possible to count actions
 aangairbender: I can reuse same vec for generation actions every time
 aangairbender: so no memory overhead
 XeroOl: ahh that's a good idea
 XeroOl: I should just do that lol
 XeroOl: screw this whole impl iterator nonsense
 XeroOl: lol thanks
 aangairbender: that was exactly my situation year ago
 XeroOl: well, thanks for passing the wisdom forward lol
 Whiskee: how long is the 407 timeout?
 Whiskee: it's been a while D:
 aangairbender: we need more rust in gold
 jacek: you can get more rust in iron
 aangairbender: true:smile:
 XeroOl: technically I'm on the leaderboard right now for lua
 XeroOl: which is really funny
 XeroOl: according to codingame, that's my best language
 Smelty: TwT my things still stuck in top 10
 aangairbender: I guess its same as python? just for heuristics stuff, nothing perfomant
 XeroOl: yeah just heuristics, and bad ones too
 Smelty: im on the leaderboard for java
 XeroOl: that's why I'm still in silver lol
 XeroOl: java actually wouldn't be that bad for sim
 XeroOl: I certainly would have an easier time writing it lol
 aangairbender: I would choose c# over java, but actually rust seems pretty easy to use after a little experience. As a bonus we get performance like c++
 ClockSort: is there a way to see how much I'm timing out in the league?
 ClockSort: i'm stopping my search at 90ms but still seems to be intermittently timing out in the IDE
 XeroOl: codingame's language server for rust is bad 
 aangairbender: I like that I can express my types very precisely in rust
 struct: why?
 XeroOl: doesn't show compile errors until you press play and wait 2 seconds
 ddreams: ClockSort do you have any output after the timeout?
 XeroOl: yeah the types are awesome
 Smelty: [me to gold] lemme in.
 Smelty: LEMMMEEE INNNN
 struct: well it needs to compile to get the errors
 XeroOl: other languages will red squiggly you when you have a syntax error
 ddreams: true story
 aangairbender: I just use VSCode and write my code in a lot of folders and files, then python script bundles everything into one file
 aangairbender: dont use IDE at all
 XeroOl: that's probably a good idea
 aangairbender: CG IDE I mean
 XeroOl: I just don't have the extension working
 XeroOl: that links CG to the local file
 Astrobytes: just copy paste it in
 aangairbender: rust-analyzer is working for me
 ddreams: I don't either, but I'm very fast at select all/copy/paste
 ddreams: and it's relatively rare that I do it, compare to build and test it locally
 struct: copy paste it until you paste it in chat
 XeroOl: ahh, I should get all that working lol
 XeroOl: lmao pasting it into chat
 aangairbender: I wrote a task for VSCode that bundle all into a single file and then copies everything into my clipboard
 ClockSort: @ddreams looks like no, it says this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db4b1142-7594-49b8-aaa0-811dfcb6fd11">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db4b1142-7594-49b8-aaa0-811dfcb6fd11</a>
 ddreams: can you delete your own message? :p

 Astrobytes: Nope.
 aangairbender: so I just need to press Ctrl+V on my CG IDE
 XeroOl: how did you do that chat.codingame.com/pastebin thing
 Astrobytes: It's automatice
 Astrobytes: *automatic
 ddreams: ClockSort might be a crash
 ClockSort: maybe the "is waiting" means I sent WAIT?
 aangairbender: if you paste a large amount of text here it will create pastebin
 ddreams: when I do an exit in the code, I get the same output
 Smelty:&#160;:(
 ddreams: Game Summary: ddreams has not provided an action in time. ddreams was disqualified. Round 0/23 ddreams is waiting

 Smelty: sighs i just can't get promote
 Hugo-NL: :o
 Hugo-NL: I am completely rewriting my code, will see if can promote :D
 ClockSort: rewrite the rewrite
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: yo dawg i heard you liked to rewrite..
 actualCoderTrevor: lol
 Smelty: do ide battles affect boss score
 Ajaiy2: I am rewriting a better and cleaner code
 Ajaiy2: And I am liking it
 Smelty: congrats
 Smelty: my code is dirty
 Ajaiy2: Thanks :smile:
 Ajaiy2: I guess spring challenges need spring cleaning
 CFIX: hello 
 Smelty: hi
 Smelty: reeeeee i'm 0.2 below boss
 CFIX: :grimacing:
 Smelty: edit: 0.14
 miszu: improve your code
 miszu: it shouldn't be hard to beat silver
 ItsNotABug: Just wait for other peeps to bump you above
 Smelty: miszu&#160;:(
 miszu: show me the reply of the boss
 Smelty: i been trying...but i'm just a code noob
 miszu: I'll find something that can help
 Smelty: replay of boss vs me? ok

 miszu: you won that example..
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: i just took the one i had
 miszu: ok show me a game you lost then
 Smelty: im trying to find one
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: doesnt sound you have a lot of problems&#160;:)

 Smelty: well im stuck at 1st/2nd place rn
 Smelty: and its very sad that i cant promote
 MSmits: ah yeah that's annoying
 MSmits: I'm in silver still also. Havent coded yesterday. WIll experiment more. 
 KCrown: are you not in this forest battle smelty?
 Ajaiy2: Im coding right now
 miszu: honestly I don't see any big mistakes
 Smelty: yay i promote
 Smelty: *happiness noise*
 ClockSort: congrats!!
 Ajaiy2: Congrats
 Smelty: KCrown i am
 Smelty: im the red boi
 <b>**Ajaiy2 pats on the back of Smelty</b></p><p><img src="/a/62842162200886" /> Smelty: im ahead of the bot by 0.01 haaha
 KelvinAndHubbles: wait, did you just beat the bot because someone else also beat him down by a considerable amount lmao
 Smelty: hol up <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/cwOREm.jpg">https://snipboard.io/cwOREm.jpg</a>
 Smelty: yes kelvi
 ClockSort: Legend, here we come!
 miszu: yee boi
 Smelty: tommrow
 Smelty: i will probably get stuck in gold
 Ajaiy2: REEEEEEEEE
 Ajaiy2: OOF
 Smelty: considerin how tuff it was for me to get in gold
 Ajaiy2: MMM Yes
 miszu: it's weird because I expected the silver bot to be dumber
 bvego: mad kudos for you guys that have the patience to get to those high leagues
 Smelty: lol.
 Smelty: bvego i literally waited for 2 hours to get promote after i submit xD
 miszu: are you gold now?
 miszu: I want to try your bot
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: rank 1130
 Smelty: so u have to follow me or something
 miszu: that's why
 Smelty: here lemme resubmi and see
 miszu: i am following you
 Smelty: ok now saerch my name
 Smelty: u r going to beat me 
 KCrown: does it take about 2 hours for ur new code to reflect in ur rankings? 
 miszu: I can't
 Smelty: considering that your rank is way better
 miszu: cuz you are below 1000
 miszu: I mean abvoe
 miszu: but you can play my bot

 Smelty: u should be able to go to "followed poeple" or friends or something
 miszu: I did but it caps at 1000 ranks
 Smelty: weird
 miszu: my replay beat the s out of you :D
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: after all i am rank 196
 Smelty: *1186
 miszu: yeah but I only do if/else
 miszu: struct hum hum...&#160;;)
 Smelty: i do if/else score
 Smelty: aaand i have 0 idea what it means
 KCrown: looks like my new code is moving me on up ... 726 now
 Smelty: hm yes if i am stuck in the depths of gold i can resubmit without fear
 Smelty: i can't go lower than 1210
 ddreams: as more people get into gold, you can indeed go lower
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: but whatevs im stuck at the bottom
 Chainman: I'm screwed, I can't go even depth=1 in my beam search now. 
 Chainman: I've made it slower I think.
 Smelty: oof
 Smelty: sucks
 King_Coda: I see you all have gotten chummy with each other
 ddreams: inadvertently made a heuristic bot
 Smelty: o.o
 Smelty: i should teach my trees how to dodge shadows
 pmor: Chainman I'm having the same issue.&#160;:(

 Smelty: oh gosh
 Maliamnon: Smelty - dodge shadows or create shadows, that is the question
 Smelty: to be or not to be
 Lucky30_: one mistake and i am back to the stone age
 Smelty: the classic question
 Maliamnon: currently have a bug
 Smelty: oop
 Smelty: bug good
 Maliamnon: eval says score estimate is 160, then i complete a tree, then my eval says 128
 Maliamnon: gotta go find those 30+ points. i dropped them somewhere
 ddreams: King_Coda I was talking about the matrix, but I guess you have more experience with those?
 Smelty: programmers debug, pro-grammers rebug
 ClockSort: ^^;
 KCrown: good news this time its not my code but my addition that is bad ... 
 King_Coda: Haha, not yet ddreams
 Smelty: yep matrix
 Smelty: red or blue pill.....

 KCrown: good way to get some extra points
 ddreams: should get a job as a bridge salesman
 Maliamnon: lol
 Smelty: what does it mean when it says dead code
 miszu: the flow will never reached there
 ddreams: it's longing for the fjords, so to say
 ddreams: it's not dead, it's just sleeping
 Smelty: hmm
 miszu: it's like coding this:

 Maliamnon: i++ is unreachable/dead ^
 Smelty: yess
 Smelty: the weirdest thing is when i fix the dead code, my ai is worse
 Smelty:&#160;;-;
 King_Coda: lol imagine incorrectly placing a semicolon
 Smelty: cOuLdnT bE mE
 Smelty: its because i put break in the wrong spot
 King_Coda: lol imagine being in the top 1500
 Smelty: is me
 King_Coda: gg smelty
 Maliamnon: does 1496 count?
 King_Coda: yes
 Maliamnon: if so, hello three.
 ddreams: hi four
 King_Coda: i'm uh
 King_Coda: not
 King_Coda: i'm 35541st
 King_Coda: ...for now :smiling_imp:
 ddreams: that's impressive, considering there's only 6511 contestants
 King_Coda: I meant on the website dummy
 Maliamnon: smallint underflow maybe?
 Maliamnon: ah
 King_Coda: 35541 out of 2.5 million
 ddreams: not a very interesting statistic, imo
 Maliamnon: I thought you meant contest. I'm 2037 on site
 King_Coda: lol imagine not understanding what i was saying
 King_Coda: :stuck_out_tongue:
 Maliamnon:&#160;:)
 ddreams: I imagine that happens often
 Maliamnon: bazinga
 King_Coda: Not really, you guys just assumed I was talking about the contest
 ddreams: For obvious reasons
 King_Coda: Eh....
 King_Coda: I don't see it
 ddreams: I'm not surprised
 King_Coda: :cry:
 Smelty: lol
 Chainman: wth I'm getting some weird timings
 Smelty: hmm really
 Chainman: beam_search taking 0.01 ms, but for all of them it takes 98ms, but it's only like 15. Math doesn't add up.
 Maliamnon: Chainman - I got smashed pretty hard over the head by GC taking 10ms every generation
 Smelty: f in the chat
 Chainman: Yeah the individual searches are fast, but the total is completely large.  I don't know how to fix that. 
 Chainman: wdym Maliamnon
 Chainman: Cause like this is just a simulation I'm doing in my beam search.  
 Smelty: weIrd
 Maliamnon: do you create lots of objects?
 ddreams: I like that I can tell my bot is doing something clearly stupid
 ddreams: need to fix my last day
 Lowz: lol
 Maliamnon: i was creating too many game states, and it took too much time to deallocate all the failed beam children when i moved on to the next depth. Chinman
 Maliamnon: Chainman, not Chinman lol
 Chainman: hmmmm It's in python so far, was planning to rewrite in c++ later. 
 Chainman: OOOH, it's my generator creating the next states that is taking a lot of time.  
 Chainman: oops, cause I was starting the timer inside and it already generated the state oops.
 ClockSort: relevant username
 Chainman: :angry:
 Foxboy: :grin:
 Chainman: Is there another way besides making a deepcopy for the next state?
 Chainman: only other option is to somehow make the state more efficient. 
 ddreams: depends on your algorithm, but sometimes updating/undoing state is possible and very fast
 Chainman: But don't you need the states to be saved in every node individually in the graph. 
 Chainman: else if you alter a state in another node it will affect all the nodes in the graph.
 Maliamnon: all the interface needs to know is your next move. up to you what other tracking you want to keep
 A2CHisPerfect: Chainman, I am new to this kind of contests. Could you give me an advise. Do you generate board states for each possible actions and then select an action with results in a highest score/sun? Could you advise some algorithm to look at?
 Chainman: I am also new lol
 ddreams: A2CHisPerfect that's a good way to start
 ddreams: generate all the states, and score them
 Chainman: but yeah as a new person that is what I'm doing. 
 ddreams: you don't need to search into the future
 ddreams: in this contest
 ItsNotABug: Yh golden rule in these things tends to be avoid creating new objets as much as possible. Make everything you might need up front in the first round, and keep re-using them
 Astrobytes: ^
 LostDragon: New problem somehow: I'm getting timeouts from the verry start of the AI, and after benchmarking (read: printing the timeing after each and every line), i saw that the moment i start reading from standard input, i'm somehow blocking for 2500ms, and after that, it's a timeout... do you guys have any idea?
 ItsNotABug: Im reworking mine atm to create all possible moves up front so I never create a new Action object :D 
 ddreams: LostDragon I assume it's something strange you're doing
 Chainman: whoah, that does work for if just looking at level=1 search
 Chainman: I could do that and it will work
 Chainman: But I don't know how I would ever scale that to a larger depth in my search algo lol.
 Chainman: But definitely will do that, thanks
 Astrobytes: Yes, if you want to search deeper, you will need to create a pool of nodes/actions/states whatever you're using to be efficient. Memory alloc is slow and you don't get much time on CG, you want to avoid allocation during a search.
 LostDragon: I'll try from that point of view for the sake of the argument: I narrowed down my prints to right before, and right after a `std::getline()`, and the time difference is now ~2411ms
 reCurse: To be pedantic, it's not memory allocation that's slow, it's the garbage collection
 Astrobytes: Yes, true 
 ddreams: LostDragon try the starter code and see if you have the same problem
 dbf: LostDragon you need to start time measurements after first input line is read
 Astrobytes: I don't mind a bit of pedantry where appropriate&#160;;)
 ddreams: Allocation is also kinda slow tho
 reCurse: Not really
 ddreams: Depends on what you call fast, I guess
 reCurse: Most managed languages only allocate on a stack
 OlivierRivoyre: Hi, noob question: does there is an interrest to go multithreaded for better perf? Or the CPU is limited to one core?
 reCurse: Compaction is where it gets dicey
 dbf: OlivierRivoyre  no
 reCurse: literally = basically
 OlivierRivoyre: thx dbf
 ddreams: sounds strange, recurse
 reCurse: Why
 ddreams: my mental model is that the managed languages mostly allocate on a heap
 LostDragon: I'm still blocking for about ~2251ms, but i'm not timeout-ed... i do realise the precomputations  i was doing were kind of heavy, but that still sounds harsh
 ddreams: could be wrong of course
 reCurse: Stack as in method of allocation
 reCurse: Not allocating on the stack
 reCurse: Sorry for ambiguity
 ddreams: Yeah, but still
 reCurse: You can allocate as a stack on the heap
 ddreams: I know
 ddreams: So you're saying the "newest generation" is stack based, and then on compaction/gc it's going to a more heap-ish allocator?
 Maliamnon: LostDragon - are you starting your timer after reading the first input? You might be timing the ref
 Paluke: What position do you need to reach to advance to Gold?
 reCurse: Details are usually implementation dependent
 miszu: 1st in silver
 reCurse: The gist is there's no point using a complex allocation scheme
 reCurse: Since you're going to run through compaction anyway
 Cjx_1: grats
 reCurse: So might as well go stack based
 GrekMaR: @Paluke above 'Bossoot" so not 1st but above him&#160;:)
 reCurse: Now the devil is in the details, C# has 3 levels of object lifetime
 reCurse: So that's where you need to dig deeper
 reCurse: But the rule of thumb is allocation is cheaper than native languages usually
 reCurse: GC however is where kingdoms burn
 Foxboy: :grimacing:
 LostDragon: I time before and after the very first read. in the starter code for c++, it looks like cin &gt;&gt; numberOfCells; cin.ignore();. And i time before and after that
 ddreams: Well, the cheap part is that it doesn't need to ask the system to allocate more memory (if it has already asked for it)
 Cjx_1: anyone trying homebrewed algorithims other than sims or searches? Like only first principle, static if elses?
 reCurse: Same can be said for C++ though
 ddreams: however, it still needs to manage pointers etc
 LostDragon: would it be easier to talk on discord?
 ddreams: and memory fragmentation etc
 reCurse: Memory fragmentation is a collection concern
 reCurse: Not an allocation one
 ddreams: LostDragon before the first read is when you wait for the system/opponent to make his turn
 reCurse: C++ has no collection so it becomes an allocation concern
 Nerchio: finally
 Nerchio: i gave my bot a tiny brain
 ddreams: I mean, you don't get memory fragmentation on a stack
 CPomSa: @Cjx_1 That's what I'm doing too. It took me as far as silver but I'm out of ideas now&#160;;-) What about you?
 ddreams: C++ "has" collection as in it's the job of the system to do it, but it can take a long time to free up memory
 LostDragon: When i said that i time before and after, i meant that i take the high resolution time right before the first read, right after, and print the difference. Is that what my 2200ms were about? if so, i'll have to look elsewhere for the cause of the timeout
 reCurse: Right. I should have said compaction.
 ddreams: Yes, LostDragon, start your timer directly after the first read, before is meaningless
 ddreams: It will look like it times out if you crash too
 pmor: There's a trick you can do to determine if you crashed or not
 King_Coda: it's called alt f5
 pmor:&#160;?
 ddreams: ignore the troll, what's the trick?
 LostDragon: i hate that i had to look it up, and still didn't get it after trying it out
 King_Coda: or ctrl shift slt f5 if you're on chrome
 Astrobytes: King_Coda: give it a rest will you
 King_Coda: Astrobytes!

 King_Coda: I was just educating our fellow coders on the beauties of desktop shortcuts
 ddreams: that's a nice trick, pmor
 King_Coda: alt f5 force refreshes your page, that usually helps
 pmor: codinggame doesn't have the debug libraries, so you don't get a usable callstack. But it does print out the offsets
 Astrobytes: You're pushing a kick King_Coda
 ddreams: nice just to know it was a crash vs killed by a timeout
 King_Coda: :zipper_mouth:
 Bigcodrrrrr: im so confused im new to codingggg
 ReaListik: benimde
 Bigcodrrrrr: can someone help meeee
 ddreams: just keep at it and it'll get easier
 Astrobytes: Trollometer go brrrr
 ddreams: hmm.. ya
 ddreams: just sitting here fiddling with constants and watching the brutaltester :p
 ClockSort: @Bigcodrrrrr i think your keyboard is sticking at the end of words (another relevant username)
 King_Coda: Don't worry Astro, I taught him how to correctly ask questions
 Bigcodrrrrr: can someone tell me how to solve the descent?
 ClockSort: try going down
 King_Coda: ClockSort
 King_Coda: Come on, at least TRY and be helpful

 King_Coda: there's your solution
 Bigcodrrrrr: ok thank you
 AntiSquid: that puzzle has hints
 DutchYY: easy
 ddreams: yeah, not good to just throw solutions at people imo
 Astrobytes: He got a kick for it
 AntiSquid: if you cant do descent this site is way too advanced for you
 miszu: he got kicked?
 miszu: when can he come back?
 AntiSquid: i mean its a for loop
 Astrobytes: Yes. He was warned previously. Whenever he likes.
 miszu: can't he simply refresh the page and  be back?
 AntiSquid: he can
 Astrobytes: Kick is second warning, ban is a little more final.
 AntiSquid: kick == disconect
 AntiSquid: from chat
 miszu: just little
 Astrobytes: You can still use the site. Just not the channel you're banned from.
 AntiSquid: how are your bots?
 Scarfield: terrible&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: My bot's sore, been sat on this hard chair all day
 miszu: my bot can't reach top 300
 Scarfield: just finished a monte carlo, its worse than just doing first action (after wait)
 Scarfield: xD
 ddreams: My bot's has improved in self-play, just pushed it into the arena to fight it out
 AntiSquid: with mc you got to do many rollouts and take averages
 TobiasA: if i could reach silver league before the end i would consider myself a winner
 Astrobytes: Still no search for me Scarfield
 TobiasA: i am tired of bronze
 Astrobytes: Trying to get gold. Only because euler forced me.
 AntiSquid: ddreams what are you doing?
 Cjx_1: keep pushing :D  try watching the matches of some of the top guys for ideas &lt;3
 ddreams: TobiasA show us a replay
 miszu: Astrobytes you can reach it easilly
 TobiasA: hm lemme try
 Astrobytes: I was very close earlier
 Scarfield: finished bitboard sim ealier today, and decided just trying MC since i wont take the time to do any better, but its so slow for some reason
 ddreams: I'm doing a beamsearch, but it's mostly fiddling with the evaluation function
 ddreams: Scarfield profile it?
 Scarfield: too lazy :p
 Astrobytes: I just find it hard to concentrate since I'm not really into the game
 ddreams: I think it's interesting that you can reach top 20 without a search
 miszu: for me what I am discouraged is that there is no clear heuristics
 TobiasA: how do i get my replays
 miszu: you can cumulates sun poitns but.. it's the points who wins
 AntiSquid: do you think its the art at all&#160;? 
 miszu: and if you foccus on points then all you will do is chop chop as soon as you can
 ddreams: TobiasA there's a share button
 TobiasA: oh
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: what about the art?
 AntiSquid: i dont like the game mechanics, but wonder if the art affects my opinion overall
 BishopD: SUCK Mii NUTS
 TobiasA: should i show a replay with catboss or?
 ddreams: sure
 ddreams: whatever you think is intereting
 ddreams: *interesting
 ddreams: oh my, I'm timing out a lot now
 AntiSquid: ok not the art, the theme . its pretty art after all
 AntiSquid: maybe its for tree huggers?
 Astrobytes: Hadn't really looked at it, it looks nice.

 Astrobytes: Just had debug mode on the whole time
 AntiSquid: but i wonder if a different theme would be more engaging
 Astrobytes: For who?
 ddreams: debug mode is not so nice to look at, no
 AntiSquid: anyone .i am sure it has some impact
 ddreams: I think it's nice
 Nerchio: true this time i actually see more on graphial map
 ddreams: I like the game too
 AntiSquid: admitedly my main issue is how the trees are cluttered together ... not much you get out of it
 AntiSquid: the original game was more tactical
 Astrobytes: I like the theme/graphics, not fussed on the game. Can't please all the people all the time right&#160;;)
 ddreams: I like that it's challenging something that's not a strength of mine... heuristics
 AntiSquid: the art is nice, the theme fits the game, but it can affect your perception of it
 Scarfield: i actually like that you can be competetive this game without a search
 AntiSquid: this contest is def heuristics focused
 ddreams: I have a lot more experience with optimization etc
 pmor: I'm about to throw away my beamsearch and go heuristics
 ClockSort: why not both?
 ddreams: I know many places where I could get more speed, but I don't think it helps more than figuring out a better eval
 HackingHues: how many move up when legend opens? is that publicly available info...
 Scarfield: usually between 10 and 20 afaik
 Beekeeper525: Hey I just started learning python any good coding lessons
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: not best site for it Beekeeper525
 pmor: well, my beamsearch is pretty trash.  I probably have an error with it and I'm not seeing it
 Astrobytes: No lessons here Beekeeper525, just practice
 Beekeeper525: ok
 AntiSquid: tutorialspoint if you want to learn as you go Beekeeper525
 Cjx_1: college, cheaper the better
 TobiasA: do i just put the link of the replay?
 HackingHues: jeez. alright that number is a little small. probably just going to stop now that I hit gold lol.
 AntiSquid: top have beamsearch too, but they apply correct heuristics for pruning nodes
 ddreams: hit top 500 gold then, HackingHues
 AntiSquid: i have chokudai search which is somewhat like beam search, my heuristics and pruning are both crap

 mybk: why beam search and not MCTS&#160;? 
 mybk: is there some advantage in beam search&#160;? compared to MCTS
 mybk:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: MCTS is fine, depends how you apply it
 AntiSquid: minimax is fine too ... anything is fine, just have good eval
 mybk: I added a lot of heuristics to prune 
 LostDragon: sassy
 AllYourTrees: mcts is good if you don't know a good eval function. it just explores the state space uniformly randomly via the random actions. if you have a good eval MCTS will still explore the space uniformly randomly, which will result in you spending time searching bad states
 ddreams: TobiasA try to avoid planting close to your own trees
 AllYourTrees: beam search searches the state space fully based on your eval function. so if you have a good eval function, then it will limit its search to good areas of the state space
 King_Coda: Hah, I beat orangesnowf0x in wood league!
 TobiasA: the bot does it it did hard code my own strategy the dumb bot uses minimax and is still dumb
 King_Coda: take that!
 TobiasA: bruh i can't type
 mybk: yeah but in this contest, it's kinda not helpful to simulate the game until the day 24, that's why  I'am using an eval function with MCTS
 Astrobytes: EPT mybk?
 AntiSquid: you can stop early 
 mybk: EPT ==&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Sorry, early playout termination MCTS
 Scarfield: ealy propagation termination
 AllYourTrees: (stopping the rollouts before the end of the game is reached)
 Astrobytes: PropagandaField
 mybk: yes I am only simulating 6 days 
 Scarfield: xD yea that is not what its called
 Astrobytes: Or even not rolling out at all in some games.
 AntiSquid: rank mybk&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Just gone or going gold I think
 mybk: 1 in silver league, still playing though
 Astrobytes: I think that's a definite gold
 AllYourTrees: hypeeeeee
 TobiasA: my bot can't simulate a day without timing out
 mybk: yes I think so
 elderlybeginner: my code is something like starter + 30 lines
 AlMualem: guys which do you think is the simplest way to calculate the distance of 2 cells?
 elderlybeginner: I don't understand how you strugle with simulating days in silver league
 AntiSquid: haha elderlybeginner nice rank
 AllYourTrees: people have different backgrounds?
 ddreams: TobiasA it's hard to do minimax here
 elderlybeginner: AlMualem with 3D cell naming
 AntiSquid: you found good heuristics

 AlMualem: vectors x,y,z?
 TobiasA: what method do you suggest?
 ddreams: evaluate all moves and sort them according to the score
 TobiasA: yea i did that
 ddreams: you can get to top 20 that way
 ddreams: do it better :p
 Astrobytes: AlMualem:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/</a>
 TobiasA: wait what
 AntiSquid: you can use your code for enemy prediction and write a search bot elderlybeginner
 TobiasA: but it isn't working for me
 AlMualem: ok thats exactly the page i am looking right now...so i suppose i am in the right way! :P
 ddreams: then you have to debug/improve
 Astrobytes: AlMualem: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/af44a865f6814131d25edc29357fc2dba5cec4a6/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/af44a865f6814131d25edc29357fc2dba5cec4a6/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CubeCoord.java</a>
 AlMualem: ty man
 Astrobytes: (last link is the relevant part of the game code)
 ddreams: for example, it's much easier to not plant all your trees on top of each other with a heuristic
 TobiasA: what is the best thing to use as a "score" for a move
 elderlybeginner: AntiSquid, I bearly undestand what you mean :wink:
 ddreams: TobiasA what would you consider if you played the game yourself?
 XeroOl: maybe we should play the game ourselves
 TobiasA: i used the actual score + sun /3 as the game says
 ddreams: yeah, that's good for the final round
 AntiSquid: you found good if/else conditions (= heuristics, educated guesses ...)
 XeroOl: if you were to buy this as a board game, would you only be thinking about actual socre + sun/3?
 ddreams: but before that, maybe you think it's better to have some trees than no trees?
 ddreams: then give points for having some trees
 TobiasA: hm good idea
 elderlybeginner: AntiSquid, by "bearly" I meant enemy prediction and search bot
 AntiSquid: search bot = algorithm to find best moves
 Chainman: I did that thing
 elderlybeginner: oh, that's what i have, an evaluating function
 AntiSquid: enemy prediction = you try to guess what the enemy will do and use this to improve your algorithm to find best moves
 TobiasA: so you mean i should make it that actions that lead to more trees after evaluation are better actions than the rest?
 elderlybeginner: and that's a tricky part :joy:
 AntiSquid: but a mere evaluation isn't a search ... 
 TobiasA: then it will just seed forever
 XeroOl: you've over adjusted your evaluation
 elderlybeginner: no, I'm not looking for anything, I just rate possible actions rating them in accordens of income - cost
 ddreams: TobiasA yep
 ddreams: that's a start
 ddreams: you need to give some score to everything you think is important
 XeroOl: TobiasA if you do trees before all else, you've basically changed your evaluation to:number of trees * 9999999 + score + sun/3
 ddreams: It's actually good practice to start doing something like that
 XeroOl: but you don't have to put # of trees before or after your evaluation function
 ddreams: like can you make your bot do only planting?
 XeroOl: you can pick a reasonable factor and then actually have the values mix
 TobiasA: so with this method you guys are suggesting it means i myself has to have a strategy for the game?
 XeroOl: yeah
 XeroOl: even the simulation people have strong heuristics like that
 TobiasA: tbh i have been avoiding that all this while
 TobiasA: but i guess it is time
 TobiasA: i can't stop at bronze just like that
 Chainman: Is silver boss even hard&#160;:::::: yikes
 XeroOl: I'm stuck in silver, so I'd assume the answer is yes
 TobiasA: i have never gotten out of bronze in any game on this site
 Momtaz: I'm using rule-based bot no search at all and can reach top 250. Understanding the game is important
 Chainman: Yeah I'm in silver too lol
 XeroOl: I just don't have enough time
 Chainman: You will get there
 XeroOl: this is mixed in with college exams
 Chainman: hahahahahaha my first turn 3000 ms
 Chainman: and it doesn't timeout
 TobiasA: goodluck with your exams
 AllYourTrees: ^
 TobiasA: and silver league too
 lpellieer: hi i'm in bronze and i'm wondering if i should use some kind of genetic algorithm to get better, what do you guys think&#160;?
 Chainman: ^
 XeroOl: getting out of bronze can be done with just heuristics
 ddreams: lpellieer sounds interesting
 XeroOl: whether or not you want to is a different story though
 Chainman: I got out of bronze with if-else
 BrunoFelthes: I think that genetic algo is hard to deal when one action invalidate another
 Chainman: and not really complicated, I think like 6-8 of them too. 
 HackingHues: you can also get out of silver with heuristics
 lpellieer: okay i'll look into it
 AllYourTrees: why are you doing this competition? to get as high as possible or to try interesting stuff?
 ddreams: both
 XeroOl: Writing deep heuristics just feels draining though
 Momtaz: I have 72 if statements haha 
 TobiasA: i just want to get better at coding to be honest
 Chainman: I'm doing it to learn graph algorithms, 
 lpellieer: both! i'd like to learn some new things while improving my code
 Chainman: But it is too slow.
 XeroOl: yeah, writing this stuff for codingame needs to be fast
 TobiasA: i know i don't have a single chance of getting into gold 
 pmor: are bitboards required for fast sims in this challenge?
 XeroOl: The sim I'm working on right now isn't a bit board
 XeroOl: but it's not done yet
 XeroOl: so I dunno if it's fast or not
 XeroOl: @tobiasA What is the bronze boss doing that you aren't?
 XeroOl: that's usually a good way to get out of a league
 XeroOl: figure out what it's doing that you aren't
 pmor: I'm getting ~2k sims/ms.  Not sure what other people are getting
 TobiasA: the boss is planting and growing in the beginning then spamming complete towards the end
 XeroOl: why not do that, but bias toward the center where there's more points?
 xk9c: yo guys is the best way to improve programming skills (for me java) to play this coding game?
 XeroOl: or cash out a daty earlier than the boss, to get the nutrient points?
 AntiSquid: sure
 Chainman: My bot harvested all trees and forgot to seed in middle of game&#160;::
 ddreams: xk9c if you enjoy it, yes
 XeroOl: @xk9c  I dunno about the "best" way, but it's certainly a good way to get practice in
 xk9c: yes it makes fun if i can solve it :D
 ddreams: then get going
 XeroOl: okay I'll get going, goodbye codingame chat
 xk9c: bye
 TobiasA: thanks for the advice XeroOl and ddreams
 ddreams: looking forward to see you in silver, Tobias
 TobiasA: k i'll try my best
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you got this
 Chainman: let's goo 
 TobiasA: wait when is it ending i forgot that there is a time limit. remains 3 days
 Chainman: Yeah ther eis a timer.
 Chainman: need get gold today
 Scarfield: you can change the date on your pc to get some extra time
 TobiasA: woah
 Chainman: ^ :grimacing:
 Chainman: big brain time
 Lysk: XD
 TobiasA: i'm sure you are trolling
 TobiasA: wait but that won't change when the contest ends
 Scarfield: of course&#160;:)
 Chainman: YOu need to change the time on the CG servers actually
 TobiasA: what if someone uses tensorflow?
 TobiasA: and deep learning
 TobiasA: and just gets the whole screen
 TobiasA: and maybe does reinforcement learning
 TobiasA: so he/she doesn't need data
 TobiasA: if only it was that easy
 pmor: You would need the tensorflow libraries which codingame doesn't provide.
 mybk: 100 ms and 100kb file size not enough for that 
 avdg: probably with pre training
 baypoint1: c++ good to dive right into or is there something simpler i should master first?
 TobiasA: c++ is the simplest you can find out there
 baypoint1: ok thanks
 pmor: c++ is anything but simple
 TobiasA: hehe
 TobiasA: i am joking
 pmor: if you don't have much experience, I would suggest javascript or python
 baypoint1: closes 10 hour c++ course vid*
 TobiasA: haha i feel you
 TobiasA: been there done that
 baypoint1: yea i have none, tryna make a career change
 AllYourTrees: whats stopping codingame from providing pytorch or tensorflow?
 TobiasA: atleast they allow numpy
 TobiasA: so maybe someone could make their own nearal network library
 Astrobytes: They had TF before iirc AllYourTrees, and there was some kind of MNIST-ish puzzle to do
 TobiasA: then be a bot programming god
 Westicles: Isn't TF slow?  At least it seemed to be when I tried it a few years ago
 Lysk: there was a TF puzzle a long time ago, it got removed (outdated libs), there isn't any benefit in having TF or torch since you hava to submit a single file bot (no reading weights)
 AntiSquid: just the one puzzle and that was restricted lol
 Astrobytes: But it was python2 only, when they ditched that the python3 never got it
 AllYourTrees: oooh interesting
 Lysk: many have tried NN on the platform, I had a script to generate .h files out of a TF network
 AntiSquid: good question though, why don't they have the libraries at least? i understand why they don't have multiple file submits
 Lysk: how would you use it?
 Astrobytes: And Lysk is correct, there's no use with the time limit, you have to scrape replays/self-play offline and figure a way to get the weights in to your CG bot
 AllYourTrees: ya maybe you could submit a zip of main script &amp; weights?
 TobiasA: someone could make their own a deep reinforcement learning bot then after playing every game they print all the updated weights then copy and paste it to the bot then do that 10,000 more times
 AntiSquid: you'd have ready trained models easier ported
 Lysk: TobiasA, that won't work, the bot has no memory in between games
 TobiasA: yea thats why you transfer the new weights into your bot after every game
 AntiSquid: AllYourTrees they don't like multi file submits, we don't have this at all on CG, would be useful
 Lysk: I was doing: train offline on my computer, put the weight in file along with the rest of the code
 AllYourTrees: gotcha AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: lysk well which is easier using the library or writing your own forward prop code to squeeze inside your code&#160;?
 TobiasA: after this contest i have to learn how to get replay data to use for bots
 AllYourTrees: could you paste the compressed bytes into a string in your python file and load it that way?
 AllYourTrees: bytes of your weights i mean
 Westicles: Not for a contest.  There is a rule against obfuscation 
 AntiSquid: even for NN weights? :D
 TobiasA: what is obfuscation?
 AntiSquid: i doubt it
 AllYourTrees: "Obfuscating your code as well as creating obstacles to its reading and understanding."
 AllYourTrees: hmmm
 AntiSquid: well others submitted NN bots before in contests so ...
 TobiasA: what is obfuscating?
 Lysk: AntiSquid, right, import torch/TF, define network, assign weights from hardcoded numpy array then call predict. Indeed that would work
 AllYourTrees: obfuscating means to make something hard to understand
 Scarfield: obfuscation is basicly making your code unreadable, make another person unable to understand it
 AntiSquid: you need to squeeze it all in 100,000 characters
 AntiSquid: AllYourTrees
 TobiasA: understood
 easdasd: guys who likes my profile
 AllYourTrees: Lysk and if your neural net is pretty simple you could just implement it using numpy arrays, i don't think you'd even need pytorch
 AntiSquid: actually probably less than 100k, more like 90k i think there's some bug with character count in the IDE
 AntiSquid: Python3	3.9.2Includes NumPy 1.20.2, pandas 1.2.4, SciPy 1.6.3	768
 AllYourTrees: AntiSquid hmm 100 kb... that'd have to be a pretty small network
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 TobiasA: i like your profile
 TobiasA: i've always wondered what it'd be like if rockets use AI
 AntiSquid: like spaceX&#160;? TobiasA
 AllYourTrees: gonna head out, see ya'll later
 AntiSquid: bye
 TobiasA: exactly
 easdasd: guys who can teach me how to hack the nasa
 AntiSquid: wrong site easdasd
 TobiasA: what if starship used AI?
 easdasd: ok i go on ashjkdfhjjkhhackerpro.onion
 TobiasA: would it be more or less succesful?
 WolfDarrigan: Pretty sure starship uses MechJeb
 Lysk: recent exemple <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzy7yf_QLl0&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzy7yf_QLl0&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> america's cup, assisted hull design with DL/RL
 Scarfield: has there ever been a rocket not using AI?
 TobiasA: waaaht
 Porsuk: can you cast a spooky shadow on your trees?
 AntiSquid: what if cars used fuel&#160;?
 WolfDarrigan: Yes Porsuk
 TobiasA: so all rockets use AI?
 Porsuk: fug
 Porsuk: back to the lab
 TobiasA: i mean like for controls
 Scarfield: TobiasA 11:15PMi'm sure you are trolling
 TobiasA: no no no
 ClockSort: @Porsuk yes you can
 TobiasA: isn't the trajectory of a rocket pre planned?
 pmor: They were doing that back in the `60s with Apollo
 TobiasA: hmmmmm so they do use AI?
 TobiasA: wowowowow
 TobiasA: i guess i am a boomer
 Nerchio: i lost twice to a potato
 Astrobytes: They used Prune Arrays and cegimax to get to Mars you know.
 Nerchio: :thermometer_face:
 pmor: lol
 cegprakash: same bot can end up with 150 rank difference in gold?
 Nerchio: if its bad sure
 Scarfield: oof xD
 Lysk: yeah variance can be really high
 cegprakash: Thx Lysk
 ClockSort: @cegprakash I was 200th Gold and I resubmitted it to test this theory. Now I'm 324th gold (same code)
 ClockSort: so, yes.
 cegprakash: thx ClockSort
 AntiSquid: you should know, it's not your first contest, it's a bit random
 cegprakash: differs with games
 cegprakash: especially this game has no fog
 cegprakash: so I expected a less random
 AntiSquid: i argue that WAIT with no inputs after is fog-like
 WolfDarrigan: Stupid question: for folks doing simulations, do you carry over explored states from one turn to the next?
 TobiasA: google said most modern rockets only use ai for inspection and checking for malfunctions 
 cegprakash: WolfDarrigan u only need the previous state
 WolfDarrigan: Do you just continue on your simulation from that state?
 jacek: tree reuse?
 Whatar: Guys I need help, I downloaded cg-brutal-tester, I have the Refee.java file, how do I compile it? With ecplise it gives me an error
 Nerchio: WolfDarrigan no
 Astrobytes: Cause you need Eclipse not ecplise. Also... ECLIPSE?
 Whatar: bro, I just downloaded it
 Whatar: I don't use java
 Nerchio: intellij community edition
 Nerchio: you're welcom
 Whatar: thank you I guess
 Nerchio: anyway
 Nerchio: if you ask questions like "what do i do, it gives me an error"
 Nerchio: i will ask if you tried to restart
 Whatar: ok bro I am gonna post the 98 lines error if you want
 Whatar: I just think that I am doing it wrong
 Whatar: I don't even know if I have to build the entire project or just the referee
 Nerchio: you need to compile the referee with mvn compile first
 Nerchio: it will give you a jar that you use for brutal tester later
 Whatar: thanks
 Nerchio: anyway i think the official referee doesnt work with it right of the bat
 Nerchio: if you are trying that
 Whatar: mmh yeah I was trying that
 Nerchio: i sent you a pm
 Roxxx: evening guys, anyone familiar with mySQL here?
 ClockSort: yes
 Nerchio: yes im familiar
 Nerchio: nice language
 Astrobytes: I think it's public domain now Nerchio, the compatible brutaltester version/referee
 Nerchio: sadly cant code a bot with this
 Nerchio: ok nice Astrobytes
 TobiasA: i am coding my bot with css
 Nerchio: actually if they gave you a database with board state mysql could be pretty good
 ClockSort: I am using HTML1 but I'm still in bronze
 ClockSort: I am using HTML5 but I'm still in bronze
 TobiasA: definite win for me
 TobiasA: i am using microsoft word
 ClockSort: ooh, nice, I'm using WordPerfect for DOS 6.2
 dbf: ufff, gold finally :joy: :tada:
 TobiasA: bruh i am using BASIC
 Nerchio: gratz dbf
 TobiasA: congrats dbf
 TobiasA: i wish i were that smart
 Astrobytes: nice one dbf&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nerchio: what's the point when it's already in the input? 
 Astrobytes: I mean, the DB already struggles
 TobiasA: imagine if this site had 3d games
 MSmits: wow... well that explains why I am doing so badly this contest...
 MSmits: I was messing up nth element
 MSmits: confusing 2nd and 3rd param
 Astrobytes: ah, copied from struct
 TobiasA: goodnight internet
 cegprakash: rank 400 bot resubmit -&gt; rank 550 -&gt; resubmit rank 660
 Astrobytes: TobiasA it does have 3D games
 Westicles: instead of nth element I use 5th element with multipass
 MSmits: huh?
 struct: whats hapening?
 Astrobytes: M U L T I P A S S&#160;! Multipass!
 Nerchio: so why are you guys using it if performance is not crucial here
 MSmits: i am guessing it's a 5th element movie reference, but not sure struct
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I think that's the error struct had
 Roxxx: @cegprakash i feel you lol
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: Which error?
 Astrobytes: And yes MSmits, that was
 MSmits: std::nth_element(children, children + BEAM_WIDTH - 1 , children + childCount, [](GS const&amp; a, GS const&amp; b) -&gt; bool { return a.eval &gt; b.eval; });
 Astrobytes: struct:"I was messing up nth elementconfusing 2nd and 3rd param"
 struct: ah
 MSmits: I had beamwidth -1 and childcount the other way around
 struct: my mistake was something else I think
 Astrobytes: Similar iirc
 struct: took me a while to get nth_element at first
 MSmits: I used it several times before, which makes it worse :P
 Westicles: Ever figure out why g++ and VS give different answers?
 struct: different algo
 struct: same algo different code
 Astrobytes: Implementation details matter #IDM
 Michael_Howard: Is there a way to get back the seed of a previous game? (Assuming you didn't copy it)
 avdg: in the arena?
 MSmits: if it's in IDE, just set seed to manual and it will use the same seed every time. I think you can also extract it from a replay
 Astrobytes: ^
 avdg: in the arena there is a send game parameters to ide button
 Astrobytes: Just make sure you're in MANUAL mode
 Astrobytes: hi avdg
 avdg: hi
 Michael_Howard: In practice, didn't realise I was on Auto. :sleeping:
 Michael_Howard: I need sleep
 avdg: making progress in small steps atm
 Astrobytes: Easy enough to do. (The mistake and the sleep :D )
 avdg: wow
 avdg: jumped to 22
 avdg: in brons :p
 Nerchio: nice man
 avdg: never got better than 200 for now
 AntiSquid: now do it gold
 Astrobytes: You should be in silver soon avdg
 avdg: dunno, I didn't beat the ai yet
 avdg: but my ai is slightly more aggressive in seeding now
 AntiSquid: look avdg there's a TS on the 21st spot of gold, your's should be 22nd :P
 avdg: I didnt expect to make it in the top 100 yet
 Michael_Howard: Just realised I haven't played a bot yet. That's crazy.
 avdg:&#160;?
 avdg: I didn't code for at least 3 days btw
 Michael_Howard: They opened the leagues without gatekeeping, just pick the first n.
 avdg: and wasn't a lot on the computer in the weekend too
 Michael_Howard: To keep safe the squirrels running the servers.
 avdg: dunno if they can do preselect
 Astrobytes: Michael_Howard: the bosses are actual players other than the Wood league ones
 Michael_Howard: They edit them a little I think.
 Michael_Howard: Take out word bubbles &amp; such.
 Astrobytes: Sometimes, if there is some random in there or messages
 avdg: I wonder if the bots have spaghetti code
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Michael_Howard: So everyone isn't rickrolled by the boss for a week.
 MSmits: never gonna give you up :musical_note:
 Astrobytes:  /kick
 Nerchio: its not a mess if its all global :sunglasses:
 AntiSquid: there's confirmed spaghetti in top 200 avdg
 avdg: must be delicious&#160;:-)
 MSmits: :spaghetti:
 Astrobytes: Never understood the fascination with that Rick Astley tune, I would have picked Fade To Grey by Visage 
 MSmits: Visageroll doesn't have the same ring to it
 Astrobytes: Especially given the viewer issues for some people at the start of this contest
 avdg: maybe pick trololo
 MSmits: that one is pretty cool
 MSmits: mmh well after my fix: submit has 18 wins out of 20 battles, 2 losses are time outs&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Viroll. There. Fixed.
 MSmits: think i may get to gold before bed
 Astrobytes: Don't get toooo confident. I was 3rd for a bit
 MSmits: hmm, well i did two tests in ide and beat boss twice
 MSmits: 2 is good statistics
 AntiSquid: got a good bot now MBits&#160;?
 MSmits: at least i have less of an embarassment AntiSquid
 MSmits: but need to fix this timeout thing
 MSmits: i do a timecheck after every depth level in bs, which is stupid
 MSmits: need to check more often
 struct: I need to figure eval 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: less of an embarrassment&#160;? what was so out of order
 avdg: I don't even do brute force..
 MSmits: AntiSquid my bot didnt do nth element properly, so everything i tried failed. Have to retry all my ideas =/
 avdg: would be fun if ai loads are posted as well
 avdg: dunno
 AntiSquid: MSmits i had a lot of weird bugs ... so eh
 Queuebee: struct thanks for teaching me x&amp;2^n-1 is way faster than x%2 :D
 Queuebee: struct thanks for teaching me x&amp;2^n-1 is way faster than x%2^n-1 :D
 AntiSquid: but after fixing them my bot doesn't do better than bugged version
 struct: I teached you what?
 Queuebee: oh i thought I was going to edit that with arrow-up excuse me
 MSmits: yeah, but i spent half the contest with this bug. I finished beamsearch on the 2nd day and never knew
 AntiSquid: stuff like adding my sun to the opponent's sun for eval :D
 MSmits: spent a lot of effort testing my sim, without ever testing the beamsearch
 MSmits: bot with timeout bug may promote. 35 games so far, no losses, only 2 timeouts
 avdg: I think I have the beamsearch implemented twice in my code now
 MSmits: 10th now
 Astrobytes: (he's been working at this for almost 3 days now you know)
 avdg: didn't debug it a lot
 AntiSquid: struct threw legend chance away
 dbf: MSmith, fix timeout and re-submit to have 100% wins&#160;:)
 MSmits: nah, i am not jinxing it
 avdg: I have bfs, and I have 1 test for that (just checks output)
 struct: What do you mean threw?
 MSmits: also just got real loss
 MSmits: 40th game
 MSmits: and i am above boss now&#160;:)
 avdg: but meh, good quality code alone doesn't make one win
 AntiSquid: why there's no bits emote
 MSmits: you can just use 1 and 0
 MSmits: what would be bits emote?
 Astrobytes: 0000 0000 0000 0000
 AntiSquid: :one:
 Kolo9: for the people using beam/chokudai, anyone willing to share the "next state" they generate? do you look at every possible move combination for the day (with heavy pruning?)
 AntiSquid: something like 0101 i guess
 Kolo9: finally decided to build a sim but can't get it anywhere near my simple heuristic bot
 MSmits: Kolo9 people will be doing it differently. Try to look at how to play the game efficiently and then try to translate that to pruning rules
 MSmits: if you're going to just allow everything, every time, it's not gonna be a good bot
 Nerchio: Kolo9 i spent half a day trying to make my beamsearch reach the same level as heuristic bot with 3 ifs
 AntiSquid: :zero::digit_one::zero::one: 
 MSmits: state eval is hard in this game
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: if you compare it to hypersonic for example, where bs is also good
 AntiSquid: that's what i spent most contest on, i have the search done too
 Kolo9: haha thanks Nerchio and MSmits, gives me a bit of hope
 MSmits: hypersonic, you just count boxes destroyed with some decay to prefer early boxes
 Astrobytes: I'd say it has more in common with the previous contest than HS
 Queuebee: return myScore + myTrees  - TheirScore - TheirTrees;
 AntiSquid: Nerchio did you get a working search bot yet?
 MSmits: "their trees"  which size?
 Queuebee: AllTheirTrees
 MSmits: also does the board distribution matter?
 MSmits: does it matter which day it is?
 AntiSquid: what just tree count? 
 Nerchio: AntiSquid i am top32 i guess thats kinda bad :confounded:
 avdg: no tree size?
 Kolo9: that's the thing though..considering trees for eval is only necessary to help prune the search right?
 AntiSquid: and your score includes sun&#160;?
 Nerchio: i have the dumbest line in my evaluation but i cant remove it
 Nerchio: or it stops working
 AntiSquid: tell us after contest lol
 Nerchio: i mean
 Nerchio: i guess thats fine
 Nerchio: long treeBonus = levelZeroTreeCount * 5L + levelOneTreeCount * 10L + levelTwoTreeCount * 20L + levelThreeTreeCount * 30L;
 WolfDarrigan:  // We don't know why, but when we remove this comment everything breaks
 Queuebee: I can't figure out how to check, if I have 4 longs representing the 4 levels of trees, how to find the tree at tile X 
 Nerchio: i wanted my bot to make trees it didnt work even with overblown numbers
 avdg: console.log(42)
 Nerchio: but yeah its there now
 Nerchio: but i added that line when i had multiple bugs in my code maybe i can remove it now
 Nerchio: probably not though 
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95058e87-ac4b-4afa-86a2-a040754e58d2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95058e87-ac4b-4afa-86a2-a040754e58d2</a>
 cegprakash: I mean same day
 cegprakash: 22 in both places
 AntiSquid: maybe there's something else that's weird in your code
 Nerchio: &amp;&amp; in for loop damn
 Nerchio: i have never done that before
 Nerchio: but in this game small changes can lead to disaster
 Nerchio: experienced it a few times so
 Nerchio: guess not a surprise
 MSmits: 5 points above boss :grin:
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes: Smits go brrr
 Astrobytes: gz
 MSmits: thanks
 struct: grats
 cegprakash: I'm adding brackets for precedence lets see
 struct: Do you have synced beam msmits?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: ChokudaI?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: I doubt chokudai or bs will make much of a difference
 Nerchio: i tried syncing my beam and it was worse by like 10%
 Nerchio: now i sync only the end
 struct: beam was must better for me
 struct: sync*
 MSmits: it's going to be eval and opponent prediction
 struct: i have choku just in case, I dont think it will hurt
 MSmits: do you keep states of every move?
 MSmits: say best x state of each starting move
 struct: I keep bestState of every move
 MSmits: did you test if this was better?
 struct: it was marginal gains
 MSmits: ah ok
 CouscousAgha: when nutrients == 0 the game ends?
 struct: no
 MSmits: you still get score for richness
 struct: and suns
 CouscousAgha: but you still can cut trees with richness 0 right?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: so nice to finally see my bot spread out seeds properly 
 MSmits: it was continously dropping them next to trees
 struct: nice
 struct: Im going to add that&#160;:)
 struct: Still didnt do it&#160;:(
 MSmits: i didnt "add it" 
 MSmits: it just comes out of the beamsearch
 struct: well from eval right?
 WolfDarrigan: I still have an ugly static seed check that is separate from my search because it blows up my search too much&#160;:(
 MSmits: well sure, I do have some shading stuff. Similar to what euler described I guess
 MSmits: WolfDarrigan it may be good to have something like that
 MSmits: You could eval all seed locations and then prune some
 NinjaDoggy: I'm pretty sure just about everyone has some seed pruning technique
 MSmits: mmh well i forbid my bot to have 3 seeds at a time
 MSmits: other than that no seed pruning
 Astrobytes: seed pruning - that is amusing
 WolfDarrigan: A fair number of seed locations are nearly equivalent to others
 NinjaDoggy: MSmits try 1 instead of 3&#160;:)
 WolfDarrigan: I limit the number of seeds as the game progresses
 Nerchio: not really but its hard to tell how good they are if you dont sim opponent
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy read closely, i have 2 max currently
 MSmits: 3 is forbidden
 MSmits: 1 might not be good
 WolfDarrigan: currentState.getNumberOfTrees(0)&lt;((24-day)/6)
 NinjaDoggy: nah 1 is good&#160;:)
 MSmits: do the best bots never have more than 1?
 NinjaDoggy: pretty sure
 MSmits: gonna check that
 MSmits: thanks for tip
 NinjaDoggy: i'm one of the best bots and I never have more than 1 seed&#160;;)
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: I'm on that then!
 Nerchio: some time ago limiting seed to 1 gave me the best results
 Nerchio: like 75% win ratio vs previous version
 NinjaDoggy: and it makes sense intuitively
 NinjaDoggy: grabbing territory is pretty bad this game
 MSmits: yeah it does, but i figured maybe if you have a lot of suns it could sometimes be worth it
 NinjaDoggy: compared to sun effeciency
 struct: interesting
 NinjaDoggy: yea but you shouldn't have lots of sun&#160;:)
 struct: Ill try it o.o
 MSmits: right
 WolfDarrigan: Welp, limiting it to one seed seems better already
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy creating more competition&#160;:)
 WolfDarrigan: haha
 geppoz: I had limit of 2
 MSmits: same, in some versions
 MSmits: i wasnt sure
 WolfDarrigan: Might be time to add seeding back into my search if I only seed when there are none currently out
 geppoz: and I tought already too strict
 geppoz: let's try one
 geppoz: but now im going gold, maybe better not touch now :D
 geppoz: 3rd place :D
 geppoz: looool just after the boos
 geppoz: ok, if not promoted now I will try with one seed max&#160;;)
 struct: ty ninja
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/hTN3oOJ.png">https://i.imgur.com/hTN3oOJ.png</a>
 WolfDarrigan: I was ~900 in silver, swapping to limit to one seed put me up closer to ~600
 WolfDarrigan: Thanks Ninja
 geppoz: struct brutaltested max 2 vs max 1&#160;?
 struct: no max vs max 1
 struct: max 1 vs no max*
 struct: so 79 vs 21
 struct: 100 games
 geppoz: uh you had no max still? and so high :O
 struct: yeah
 ClockSort: i've hit that point where everythign i do worsens my bot :P
 struct: and my eval is bad lol
 struct: I dont take into account shadows at all
 struct: on eval
 WolfDarrigan: Time for a new bot, Clock&#160;;)
 struct: does brutaltester have a thread limit?
 Astrobytes: either 4 or 8? It's on the repo I think
 Astrobytes: (check it, don't take my word, I've been awake since 04.30
 Astrobytes: )
 MSmits: 4 games i think, but that's 8 bots running simultaneously isnt it?
 geppoz: the brutaltester compatible referee is public?
 Nerchio: i can only run 1 game at a time properly
 struct: Nerchio I just remove time contraints
 WolfDarrigan: I have to update my previous statement: I was ~900 in silver, swapping to limit to one seed put me up closer to ~150
 WolfDarrigan: That wasn't a dial I had thought to crank
 Nerchio: struct i will try i guess :p
 struct: and i run it on wsl which makes my machine not lag so much
 Nerchio: how do you remove time constraints? do you just set it to large
 Nerchio: numbers
 Counterbalance: -timeout 2000 works without patching the engine
 Lucky30_: quick question everyone, can cells with richness 0 ever be all the  6 center cells? (index 0 to 6)
 Counterbalance: in theory, yes
 Nerchio: maybe you can find it out in referee
 Nerchio: idk
 AntiSquid: just need to find the seed for it :P
 geppoz: look at the referee if there is any constraint
 Counterbalance: there's max 10 stone cells
 AntiSquid: there were some silly maps in OOC so i imagine there might be some here too
 Counterbalance: they come in mirrored pairs, except for the center one of course
 Lucky30_: thanks for answering
 Counterbalance: it's such a small chance you can probably safely ignore it
 mybk: I hope one day, CG add a feature that let you write a note for any submit you do, I would like to know in history, what value I changed and what I get like result 
 Counterbalance: git log&#160;?
 avdg: github's gist?
 Astrobytes: There is a plugin but it's buggy
 Lucky30_: Counterbalance thanks for the info, but i ended up managing that small chance anyways
 Lucky30_: i have even given it an unexpected message to make my day in case i got that lucky
 AntiSquid: do you folks generate the actions yourself or process the input ones?
 ClockSort: i generate my own
 WolfDarrigan: Generate them myself
 struct: generate
 Lucky30_: i guess it depends on if are making simulations or not..
 MSmits: generate yes
 Lucky30_: *if you are
 MSmits: action generation is the first part of a sim
 Astrobytes: I *can* generate but I don't need to right now
 AntiSquid: just wanted to confirm it's slower to use the ones you are given :D 
 AntiSquid: thanks for what?
 Astrobytes: Slower?
 Notter: How do people make CoC with completely black background?
 MSmits: for letting us know&#160;:)
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/14687217601?tab=analysis">https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/14687217601?tab=analysis</a> I just had a super funny game :D
 AntiSquid: i meant you confirmed it for me 
 Astrobytes: Notter: by playing the contest
 aropan: I used cgbenchmark for spring-challenge-2021 and now I get <b>An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time."</b> when run code in web IDE. When will the limit end? 
 AntiSquid: thought it's just my code
 aropan: Somebody knows?
 Astrobytes: Hey aropan :wave:Yeah they reduced the threshold
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure how many plays per how many minutes it is now
 AntiSquid: takes me about 1 hour aropan
 Lucky30_: AntiSquid and Astrobytes, for some reason, every time i see one of your messages, i get the feeling that you guys are brothers :sweat_smile:
 Nerchio: aropan move to local gaming its easy with referee
 cegprakash: with precedence I got rank 405 back @AntiSquid so may be some precendence issue
 cegprakash: always safer to add brackets
 WolfDarrigan: Found a seed that is _nearly_ solid stone seed=1084716259133342590
 AntiSquid: Lucky30_ we are triplets, me astro and aropa n
 Lucky30_: oOOOO thanks WolfDarrigan
 Nerchio: wala please stop beating my bot down&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: always resubmit to be sure
 Lucky30_: AntiSquid lol 
 cegprakash: haha
 Astrobytes: I'm serious tho
 wala: sorry
 AntiSquid: your sins are forgiven, may Automaton2000 bless you
 Automaton2000: no, but would there be a problem daninja?
 Astrobytes: really cegprakash, otherwise you can fool yourself into thinking something was better than something else. Contest leaderboard etc
 AntiSquid: sorry for what&#160;? lol
 cegprakash: I am gonna trust the leaderboard when it shows I'm higher
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: See Nerchio's earlier comment
 aropan: Nerchio: I sure that my bot is bad opponent for my bot )
 NinjaDoggy: I hate how small hard code can insanely improve your bot...
 AntiSquid: ya .. i prolly should go sleep
 Nerchio: aropan ok i see that makes sense&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: just made it so my bot doesn't complete until day 12... and the performance change is HUGE
 AntiSquid: noted thx
 NinjaDoggy: :joy:
 Nerchio: hmm i sometimes complete at day9 and i wanted to change it
 MSmits: yeah, i have it at 10&#160;:)
 ClockSort: is it a good or a bad performance change?
 MSmits: should maybe up it
 Nerchio: seems kinda bad most of the time to complete so early
 ZarthaxX: NinjaDoggy for real?
 ZarthaxX: thought putting hard limits was bad long term
 Nerchio: i think 12 and up might be too late
 ZarthaxX: not flexible 
 aropan: AntiSquid: ok, I am ready wait one hour, thx
 Astrobytes: I think it's strategy dependent but from what I see *usually* early completion is bad
 Lucky30_: i complete starting from day 16
 MSmits: ZarthaxX it depends, if you are 100% sure it is always bad to complete early, it's good to hardcode it
 NinjaDoggy: @ZarthaxX yea same... I feel sketchy about this one
 MSmits: it saves time for your search
 NinjaDoggy: 12 feels late as a hard cap
 NinjaDoggy: but jolindien never completes before 12 so&#160;:/
 ClockSort:&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: MSmits seems like it based on millions of replays
 ZarthaxX: NinjaDoggy i have seen that top never does
 Astrobytes: Like I said, it depends on the rest of your strat
 ZarthaxX: or has one ever?
 ZarthaxX: gained many ranks dogo?
 NinjaDoggy: who knows yet 23%&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: don't ping the space cowboy NinjaByte
 AntiSquid: NinjaDoggy
 AntiSquid: oops
 NinjaDoggy: also my constants were optimized without this so i'm rerunning my optimizations
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, I just talk and no one hears
 cegprakash: NinjaDoggy I changed the constant from 10 to 12 for me and I lost first 9/10 games
 ZarthaxX: you have a param fitter? :P
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: I hear Astrobytes
 NinjaDoggy: :D
 Queuebee: where do you put these hardcoded rules? in the eval?
 ZarthaxX: i guess it cant improve bad bots then, F
 NinjaDoggy: genetic algorithm where the individual is simply the parameters XD
 ZarthaxX: nice
 NinjaDoggy: (locally ofcourse)
 AntiSquid: MSmits hear an astro voice in your head? :P
 MSmits: always
 ZarthaxX: do you think that in this game comparing bot against old version always yields something better overall?
 Astrobytes: "jobbyyyy, jobbbyyyyyy"
 Nerchio: what do you guys think about leagues with so many players maybe we should get like gold1 gold2 :D
 ZarthaxX: compared to other games where optimizing for yourself is bad
 NinjaDoggy: the constant for sure makes me lose less vs weaker bots
 MSmits: ZarthaxX it depends on how varied your bot playstyle is
 NinjaDoggy: won the first 24 games
 ZarthaxX: mmmm
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: holy nice
 AntiSquid: ya Nerchio suggested and even staff were thinking about it
 ZarthaxX: it's like a good skip for middle league then ninja
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: was sent to dev null i guess
 Nerchio: AntiSquid happy to hear it
 struct: damn chat bug
 struct: I want to scroll
 NinjaDoggy: yo what if... you made it so that the bot only has that during submit :O
 Astrobytes: It's really annoying struct
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 scroll for struct
 NinjaDoggy: like it gets the time and checks if it's &gt; 1 hour after submit :O
 Automaton2000: could it be that you are trying to make a chat
 Astrobytes: Yes. So stop getting pinged by AntiSquid
 ZarthaxX: thought about that NinjaDoggy lol
 ZarthaxX: changing behaviour for contest end
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Nerchio: turn on what after 1 hour?
 Lucky30_: what happens when you are silver 324 and you submit a bot that only works 1/3 of the time????
 AntiSquid: Automaton200 was on topic :O
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy thats cool. You can also do this to submit a different bot right before end of contest
 ZarthaxX: MSmits hi btw
 MSmits: instead of submitting, you measure the time and change your parameters
 AntiSquid: got to fix this move struct somehow
 ZarthaxX: contest is not suited for you?
 NinjaDoggy: yea :O
 Astrobytes: Nerchio: any feature you like
 NinjaDoggy: parameters for stomping weak bots
 Lucky30_: you get to be rank silver 1892
 MSmits: ZarthaxX not sure, i had a nasty bug that kept me in silver
 NinjaDoggy: and parameters for edging out an advantage vs strong bots
 ZarthaxX: oh you are in gold nice!!
 MSmits: but top half of gold now
 ZarthaxX: i also had a bug
 NinjaDoggy: ok this change was definitely really good...
 NinjaDoggy: 33rd now 36%
 ZarthaxX: not marking grown trees as dormant
 ZarthaxX: but got to 300 with that bug
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 MSmits: oh thats bad but mine was worse
 MSmits: my nth element was bugged
 NinjaDoggy: lol MSmits' but was tragic :joy:
 ZarthaxX: comparing bug levels lol
 ZarthaxX: nooooooooo
 ZarthaxX: D:
 ZarthaxX: picking worst move?
 MSmits: i spent so much time checking sim, that I never bothered to check that
 cegprakash: I had 500 rank difference with an f letter
 NinjaDoggy: nah that would be better because he would have caught it earlier LOL
 AntiSquid: but your's didn't yield positive ranks MSmits
 MSmits: no i had 2nd and 3rd parameters backwards
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: how is the order then?
 ZarthaxX: just to check myself now :D
 cegprakash: 0.9f vs 0.9 changed me 500 ranks
 Astrobytes: Did you submit that twice though cegprakash
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3bea2e53-ddcf-4934-a7fd-52cc88d255b4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3bea2e53-ddcf-4934-a7fd-52cc88d255b4</a>
 cegprakash: yep Astrobytes submission ongoing
 Astrobytes: that's a float vs a double
 MSmits: thats the right way ZarthaxX
 cegprakash: that 0.9f thing I tried many times
 cegprakash: I had other bugs at that time though
 Lucky30_: cegprakash you dont stream anymore??
 cegprakash: Lucky30_ I only stream on day 1
 NinjaDoggy: @MSmits is nth element faster than making a heap?
 Lucky30_: ow
 cegprakash: don't wanna leak my strats :D
 MSmits: how do you mean a heap?
 Lucky30_: hhhhh
 MSmits: do you mean sorting the whole array?
 NinjaDoggy: like making a min heap to find the worst element
 Astrobytes: Well, I don't know what you're doing in your code cegprakash but if that's something that helps then I guess you're making dodgy comparisons
 cegprakash: coz I usually decide strats on 2nd day of contest
 NinjaDoggy: min heap datastructure
 cegprakash: but this time I have just decided something
 AntiSquid: Lucky30_ hextree is streaming daily and he is about same rank so ...
 Astrobytes: MSmits: You didn't do heaps in your studying?
 Lucky30_: coool
 MSmits: not sure how that works NinjaDoggy, but nth element is prettty standard for beam search
 MSmits: it's faster than sorting at least
 MSmits: i didnt Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Seriously?
 MSmits: well maybe by a different name?
 MSmits: describe heap stuff
 Astrobytes: Heaps!
 cegprakash: if anyone is interested in a trashtalk array here u go

 avdg: k, finally can beat the ai
 NinjaDoggy: wait... is this a top 10 submit? :O
 struct: all I need is []
 avdg: but only tried once
 MSmits: don't worry :musical_note: be heapy
 AntiSquid: binary tree
 Lucky30_: oO i love it cegprakash
 NinjaDoggy: hard coding the turn 12 thing cna't be that good...
 struct: I dont need queue vector or anything like that
 ZarthaxX: cegprakash why did you have a bug with that f&#160;??
 Nerchio: NinjaDoggy you probably jinxed yourself
 NinjaDoggy: :D
 cegprakash: no idea ZarthaxX 
 ZarthaxX: NinjaDoggy WHAT
 ZarthaxX: WHAAAAAAAAAAAT
 ZarthaxX: *OP*
 ZarthaxX: your bot is beast tho
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: mcts?
 NinjaDoggy: yea
 ZarthaxX: simu
 MSmits: nope, never done that heap thing
 NinjaDoggy: simul mcts&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: gz dogo!
 ZarthaxX: well deserved
 ZarthaxX: you crazy :P
 AntiSquid: top 20 :o
 struct: simultaneous mcts?
 avdg: bot in top 10 being hardcoded?
 NinjaDoggy: yeah really took a lot of effort adding that extra if statement :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: Seriously MSmits? But you did binary trees etc?
 cegprakash: u can get to rank 19 in 50%?
 MSmits: well sure, but not in my studies
 Nerchio: avdg bots in top10 are usually made with many small dtails
 ZarthaxX: NinjaDoggy i meant your whole bot lol
 Nerchio: details
 MSmits: just came upon that through cg
 MSmits: binary tree is just tree with 2 children every time right?
 ZarthaxX: cegprakash you mean you wanted to use doubles for more precision and used float?
 ZarthaxX: so weird, maybe random
 Nerchio: NinjaDoggy im coming for you
 NinjaDoggy: :D
 Queuebee: Is the initial loop ever different? I mean the neighbours
 NinjaDoggy: you can't, you're using java&#160;;)
 FerrusDude: :O
 Nerchio: just wait
 Nerchio: day &gt;= 12 easy
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 Astrobytes: No Queuebee
 Queuebee: great :D
 Lucky30_: AntiSquid is this his account?? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/hextree">https://www.twitch.tv/hextree</a>
 Astrobytes: Why would it be?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: wait
 Queuebee: No clue, just a worry :worried:
 AntiSquid: hm different
 Astrobytes: FerrusDude :wave:
 Lucky30_: ok
 MSmits: went from 700 silver to 350 gold in a few hrs&#160;:)
 Lucky30_: coool
 FerrusDude: @Astrobytes :wave:
 NinjaDoggy: MSmits nice! :D
 Nerchio: did you try day &gt;= 12 Msmits already
 MSmits: i had it at 10
 NinjaDoggy: he has &gt;=10
 cegprakash: MSmits going all the way for T shirt
 NinjaDoggy: probably why&#160;:(
 MSmits: should i make it to 12?
 Lucky30_: i did the same.. from 324silver to 1887silver
 FerrusDude: I'm just lurking, laughing, and trying to get my humble bot to Gold
 NinjaDoggy: 12 seems pretty good&#160;:)
 FerrusDude: :D
 Lucky30_: just the wrong side
 MSmits: allright, i'll change it
 Queuebee: im gonna hardcode completes &lt;= 12 now to get all those nutrients &gt;:)
 Nerchio: story of every submit -&gt; start losing games around 100 and slowly crawl to top~25 then get beatdown by almost everyone
 Astrobytes: Same FerrusDude: I don't like the game but I'll scrape it into gold somehow
 AntiSquid: but will you stop there?
 AntiSquid: i am gold now, slowly rewriting the entire bot 
 FerrusDude: I want to know why I can't harvest my opponents trees.
 FerrusDude: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: I will stop in gold yes.
 FerrusDude: :joy:
 AllYourTrees: gz AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: what for? lol
 FerrusDude: I think I may be facing a refactor too
 AntiSquid: i was there since opening hahah
 AntiSquid: thanks
 AllYourTrees: oh getting gold?
 Astrobytes: he's been gold for a while
 AllYourTrees: oh lol
 AllYourTrees: NVM then
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio is it working for you too? LOL
 Nerchio: well we will see i can do it every submit
 Nerchio: i will start losing soon
 ZarthaxX: yeah here comes impact
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Nerchio: just need to beatdown day &gt;=12 out of top20
 Trottel-Nit: Somehow I find it harder this time to get ideas for  improvements. I'm not getting a grip on this shadow stuff and its consequences.
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: hello everyone
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: is it me, or is 'There is no spoon' very confusing?
 Astrobytes: Play the contest instead, far less confusing...
 FerrusDude: which one?&#160;:)
 Nerchio: maybe my mistakes is that i didnt do day &gt;= 12 everywhere in the code&#160;;)
 Nerchio: and sometimes does complete earlier
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: I get weird messages like 2, 0 is not the right of 1, 0. expected 3. 0
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: 3, 0
 MSmits: that is indeed weird
 MSmits: who is sending you these?
 Nerchio:  alines
 Nerchio: aliens
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: this is a message in console output in the game There is no Spoon
 FerrusDude: which version of Spoon?
 MSmits: thought you meant this guy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/8a2661f2158ed393896abd7e74810e417239132">https://www.codingame.com/profile/8a2661f2158ed393896abd7e74810e417239132</a>
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: episode 1
 Astrobytes: Just accept that there is no spoon and do the contest instead :P
 Astrobytes: 5 losses in 35 games&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Way more now
 MSmits: so you beat jolin dien 30 times&#160;!?
 Nerchio: NinjaDoggy ok you got me :D
 Astrobytes: I'm out for tonight guys and gals, see ya tomorrow
 AllYourTrees: cyas!
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 struct: gn
 FerrusDude: later Astrobytes
 FerrusDude: Trigger_Unit_Blue - look at the grid very carefully
 avdg: top 20 in brons while I just made an improvement for my bot...
 MSmits: grats
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: I just checked the forums and found my problem. It's asking for the node next to it.
 Trigger_Unit_Blue: sorry, I'm still new to this site
 avdg: just small tweaks to make my bot slightly better chooses
 MSmits: Trigger_Unit_Blue thats fine, dont worry about asking for help
 MSmits: you caught us at a special time, so things are a bit different. Two times a year we have a 11 day contest
 MSmits: normally there will be fewer people online, but they will be more helpful 
 FerrusDude: I feel like it used to be bi-monthly
 MSmits: used to be 3-4 times a year
 FerrusDude: yea
 MSmits: we do have a lot of competition on multis though
 MSmits: just not official like this
 FerrusDude: I try to do most of them
 ZarthaxX: MSmits is the competition
 MSmits: guys, is beamwidth 2000 good?
 ZarthaxX: i guess
 AllYourTrees: i think it needs to be over 9000 MSmits
 ZarthaxX: euler has 50 MSmits
 ZarthaxX: :D
 MSmits: ZarthaxX in board games i am good competition and in some others, but mostly board games&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: i know
 Nerchio: Msmits i have width 750 :s
 MSmits: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: trying 400 here
 struct: i have 1600
 Nerchio: it kinda works for me but if i could i'd do more :P
 MSmits: i mostly get to depth 30, meaning around 5 day
 struct: with + 400 increase on chokudai
 AllYourTrees: someone needs to do an in depth study of every width
 ZarthaxX: nice
 AllYourTrees: has anyone tried varying width during the game?
 MSmits: i just thought about that
 MSmits: late game you can have more width
 TheBioTopHat_7b70: hehhehhehe
 struct: MSmits thats what chokudai is for
 struct: also early game
 MSmits: yeah, but you pay a very high price for chokudai
 MSmits: better if you just estimate it properly
 struct: high price?
 MSmits: in redoing calcs
 MSmits: iteratively
 struct: ah
 struct: right
 AllYourTrees: what is chokudai?
 MSmits: progressively widening beam search
 AllYourTrees: ahhh
 MSmits: performance is starting to matter for me
 MSmits: raised width from 1k to 2k, lot better 
 struct: performance does not matter to me
 MSmits: maybe because my eval is poor
 MSmits: it has problems finding good states
 MSmits: needs to keep more around
 pmor: how many sims/ms are you getting?
 struct: 1.5mill in 90ms +-
 pmor: holy....
 pmor: are you using bitboards?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: i am, i dont get this many though, 1.5 million is a lot
 Nerchio: i get up to 100k
 MSmits:  my eval is expensive
 struct: cant say the same
 MSmits: it's around 100k probably
 pmor: i'm getting around 250k
 MSmits: let me do proper test
 pmor: without bitboards
 struct: total chokudais: 5final width: 2800plays: 1515520
 Nerchio: i got lazy i guess
 Nerchio: my state is now 9 bitsets
 Nerchio: like 10 ints
 Nerchio: 3 doubles
 Nerchio: :joy:
 Zenoscave: struct is that in 100 ms?
 Theino: I made it to 1 state evaluated
 Theino: #silver4life
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave dont compete with structo
 struct: 90
 ZarthaxX: lol
 AllYourTrees: lol Theino
 Zenoscave: hi Zarthie pewpew
 Theino: oh wait! I evaluate all possible moves! That's so many states I evaluate
 struct: but my eval is very light
 struct: ultra simple
 Theino: nevermind, gold here I come
 struct: also ending the day is also very fast
 struct: is like 11us
 struct: my hotspot is getActions
 MSmits: It depends a lot on the complexity of the states in my case. 200k-300k
 ZarthaxX: pewpew Zenoscave&#160;:*
 Zenoscave: Currently installing windows in a vm to do performance checks
 MSmits: is my quick test
 struct: why install windows for performance checks?
 Zenoscave: does anyone score on each action?
 Zenoscave: C#
 struct: yes
 struct: ah
 Zenoscave:  can't do a proper perfview on linux
 ZarthaxX: i do
 ZarthaxX: not c#
 MSmits: Zenoscave what do you mean score on each action? Do you mean eval the resulting state?
 struct: I think so, my yes was to that
 struct: Evaling before applying is harder I think
 Zenoscave: eval after applying
 MSmits: well that's how you do beamsearch 
 MSmits: so yeah :0
 Zenoscave: vs eval after only each day
 ZarthaxX: i do
 MSmits: ohh like that
 MSmits: I think the days are too long to wait
 Zenoscave: think of it like move ordering in the card one
 MSmits: locam?
 Zenoscave: yeah
 MSmits: i do that in this game yes
 MSmits: still eval after every move als
 MSmits: also
 Zenoscave: hm I think that will be my next project
 MSmits: mmh i need a good way to fit parameters. Bot seems quite sensitive to them
 cegprakash: I hear lot of ppl use the term "beam search" may be I should learn it after the contest
 struct: param fiddler msmits?
 MSmits: you mean the one euler made?
 struct: cegprakash why not learn it now?
 struct: yes msmits
 cegprakash: struct coz am gonna write GA :D
 MSmits: i dont have the brutaltester referee
 MSmits: suck with java&#160;:(
 MSmits: dont even know how to adapt stuff like that
 struct: I can give you mine
 cegprakash: don't wanna risk some new search 
 MSmits: that would be great
 struct: but mine map generator is not great
 MSmits: better than nothing I am sure&#160;:)
 struct: also to run it on param fiddler you will need brutal tester 0.2
 struct: because I used old style referee
 struct: and you cant pass -o flag there
 MSmits: is that to remove time limit?
 struct: I just did it during testing because I had no access to referee
 struct: also it removes time yeah
 MSmits: thats fine
 struct: its basicly my code but in java
 struct: its like 400 lines
 struct: do you know how to compile to jar file?
 MSmits: no, thats my problem
 Zenoscave: MSmits do you hava ajava with source
 MSmits: NOPE
 Zenoscave: Main source
 MSmits: ops caps
 MSmits: i really dont want to try compiling java again, i always fail
 struct: Zeno cant you compile and upload to git?
 MSmits: i;ll write my own arena before i try compile java :P
 struct: because your referee should work on param fiddler on latest brutaltester
 struct: since it doesnt need -o flag
 struct: let me just see if Zenoscave can upload the jar to github, should be easier
 MSmits: ok
 struct: and referee will be accurate
 struct: mine is, just map generator isnt great
 struct: but my referee is faster

 MSmits: lol adding 0 to bitboard??
 NinjaDoggy: is 16th good enough for opening legend?
 MSmits: R1 |= 0 &lt;&lt; 1;  
 Queuebee: I can't even explain how bad my grasp of this whole thing with bits is lol
 NinjaDoggy: probably not huh&#160;:(
 struct: probably ninja
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy just short, but you should get legend right after
 MSmits: from submit randomness
 NinjaDoggy: ok
 struct: let me see if I can compile zeno one
 struct: if I can ill send it to you MSmits
 ZarthaxX: NinjaDoggy i belive you will
 ZarthaxX: becauase it's like top 20 legend
 MSmits: Queuebee if you do 1 &lt;&lt; 5 it becomes 100000b
 ZarthaxX: just hold rank
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 Queuebee: yes I uhh 
 MSmits: if you do 0 &lt;&lt; 5 it becomes 000000
 MSmits: so still 0
 Queuebee: I think? I fixed it?

 NinjaDoggy: hm... i wanna do 1 more submit though&#160;:/
 MSmits: struct thanks 
 MSmits: Queuebee i have a richness array instead
 MSmits: not everything has to be on a bitboard
 struct: i have richness array and mask
 struct: for eval
 MSmits: I guess i could turn mine into a mask for eval
 struct: array for moves
 Queuebee: Yeaaaaah I figured I won't make a sim that beats my dumb python heuristic so I'm just practicing bit thingies
 MSmits: ohh ok
 NinjaDoggy: @MSmits i have both&#160;:)
 Queuebee: how does that work?? Array and masks
 NinjaDoggy: array for complete and bitboard for eval
 Queuebee: i thought you cant mask an array
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: they are separate things
 MSmits: sometimes an array is more convenient 
 MSmits: and sometimes a mask is
 MSmits: so why not have both
 MSmits: since they are small
 MSmits: no cache problems 
 Queuebee: but s p e e d
 MSmits: if you are looping over individual trees for some other reason, then it doesnt cost you anything to use an array
 MSmits: you already have the tree index
 MSmits: so use it to lookup richness from array
 Zenoscave: Yeah I can upload a jar
 struct: ok im finishing compiling :p
 Queuebee: Yeah next part would be figuring out how to get back the richness of a tile  :joy::joy:
 MSmits: in your case?
 Queuebee: yeah, I have no clue yet how to do that
 MSmits: well the R thingy should be like this: R[4]
 Zenoscave: MSmits there's a fork of my fork that's a lot better
 MSmits: then you can loop over it
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021/">https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021/</a>
 MSmits: loop from 0 to 3, check if the bit is set for the tile, if so, then thats your richness
 Queuebee: there's no other way?
 MSmits: if you want the richness of a single tile then no
 MSmits: unless you do the array thingy
 MSmits: int richArray[37] = { 0 };
 MSmits: fill that, and you can look up every time
 Queuebee: yeah I had that
 MSmits: it is better in some cases
 MSmits: but if you want to loop over all trees at once and add up richness, then the R thingy could be better
 MSmits: what do i do with it Zenoscave?
 Queuebee: mhm thanks&#160;:)
 struct: ok i cant compile it sorry&#160;:(
 struct: Zenoscave help&#160;:(
 Queuebee: time to snooze
 Queuebee: Good night everyone! &lt;3
 MSmits: gn Queuebee
 Zenoscave: what are you trying to compile struct?
 struct: spring-2021
 Zenoscave: mvn package
 struct: hmm, ill just give msmits the version of mine that is compiled
 struct: it does half the job :p
 MSmits: cool
 cegprakash: new leader kovi
 ZarthaxX: almost

 Zenoscave: KelvinAndHubbles If the referee you write is in a different language but still uses the same output rotocol it will work
 KelvinAndHubbles: ok, wacked, makes sense I guess
 KelvinAndHubbles: gotta check that out

 FerrusDude: Truth.
 FerrusDude: :laugh:
 FerrusDude: :smile:
 LUAcoding: (0-0)
 FerrusDude: 833 -&gt; 56
 FerrusDude: I'll take it! that was a nail biter of a run
 KelvinAndHubbles: frikkk, I submit a run for the night, get off, check my phone and it says I'm 3rd, get back on to see if I'm delusional, and my code instantly jumps back 100 places -________-
 FerrusDude: zomg, I feel you
 FerrusDude: I watched my bot bounce up and down the ranks.
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, too stressful, Imma sleep and then fix this buggy mess in the morning, gn yaal
 FerrusDude: laters
 KelvinAndHubbles: altho, bounced back up to top 10, so hopefully good run :D
 FerrusDude: hahaha
 FerrusDude: gg
 FerrusDude:&#160;:)
 Zandy156: I haven't experienced any jumping back in forth in this contest.
 GarethEddies: whats your rating zandy&#160;?
 Zandy156: I thought it was because of the game but maybe its how my bot works
 Zandy156: I'm 311 in gold
 GarethEddies: nice, I guess up at that level things don't move too quickly?
 Zandy156: maybe, I've only had one submission per league which is also new for me
 GarethEddies: 1829 Silver, just now
 GarethEddies: I've only been on codingame a week or so
 Maliamnon: ugh. #2 in silver at 80% then lost to the boss 3 times in a row&#160;:(
 struct: Maliamnon just wait
 struct: even if you dont promote someone will push you eventually
 R_Rex: does anyone finished the Puzzle of the Week (updated 3 days ago).I am traped in test 06.why the input line with header DEF but with END.
 R_Rex: but without END
 Smelty: o.O
 dbdr: R_Rex, most people are doing the contest at the moment

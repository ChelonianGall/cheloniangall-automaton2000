 error_137: I have a problem. I am getting the error message: invalid syntax at Answer.py not in a function on line 24
 error_137: can anyone help?
 punsh: share your code...
 error_137: how
 Allis: Put it on pastebin or something?
 error_137: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3814ea61-1701-4e35-b26b-222a4e2b4e40">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3814ea61-1701-4e35-b26b-222a4e2b4e40</a>
 Allis: You need == on Line 16, not =.
 error_137: but I declare the variable Boostuse
 Allis: It's not a variable issue.
 Allis: The operator for checking equality in Python is '==', not '='.
 error_137: owww
 error_137: in the if 
 Allis: Yeah.
 error_137: I get it 
 Allis: Cool, cool.
 punsh: exactly.
 punsh: and BOOST should be a string...
 punsh: like 'BOOST'
 error_137: yea I changed that
 error_137: But now I get this:Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 Astrobytes: you're printing twice
 punsh: if Boostuse == 0: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/633410b3-c474-4b27-a60e-fb91fcfed8a0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/633410b3-c474-4b27-a60e-fb91fcfed8a0</a>
 punsh: and delete the list line 
 error_137: okay ty
 punsh: as Astrobytes says you're printing two lines and that may cause a problem with reading next game input.
 punsh: suure.
 error_137: I got
 error_137: ty
 error_137: idk if it's a glitch but the screen with the cars on doesn't move
 error_137: But it says I won

 AlPaca: is there an api facility that would allow me to connect a bot to some of the league games?
 AlPaca: i'd like to work on a learning neural network but not sure how to realize the learning bit without permanent memory

 ProgrammerDog: hi lol
 eulerscheZahl: wait, the contest starts at 4pm CET this time, not 6pm?but that collides with Kotlin heroes&#160;:(
 Gabbek: Good day everyone&#160;:)
 ZygimantasBeliauskas: hello guys and girls

 grateful_tomato: why is the expected result for test case 11 False in this puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/44443842ae60475b72ca77a0f71d80438a8f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/44443842ae60475b72ca77a0f71d80438a8f</a>  ? It is an undirected graph, and it is possible to reach each vertex from each vertex. I drew it with graphviz, you it is clear to see: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/2tGN4mD.png">https://i.imgur.com/2tGN4mD.png</a>
 NightScap3: what are other cool sites like codingame where I can solve cool puzzles or have contests?
 ParticleBeam: Odd. Seems like the answer should be true unless I misunderstood the definition
 grateful_tomato: right, this is what I was thinking, and what my program calculates
 ParticleBeam: Put a comment in 
 grateful_tomato: well, 5 of 13 people of a private clash got 100%, so probably I just didn't understand the problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: grateful_tomato vertices number 10 has no edge
 ParticleBeam: Oh I see. "One vertex missing"
 ParticleBeam: There should be 11 verticies. Only 0-9 have edges
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 0-10 = 11 verts
 ParticleBeam: Therefore 10 is isolated
 grateful_tomato: thanks, I assumed all vertexes have links, my bad&#160;:-) 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that is for a clash?
 grateful_tomato: yes, was in a private clash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1450847e0abe57040fb6864b9e6b9667c1156f7">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1450847e0abe57040fb6864b9e6b9667c1156f7</a>
 grateful_tomato: it wouldn't be too difficult, if I would have read the description right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Hmph, I would throw Floyd Algorithm at it, which would be too much for clash
 grateful_tomato: I fixed my solution, works now. Not the most elegant program, but I could have done it in 15 minutes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/7aCNh3mQ">https://pastebin.com/7aCNh3mQ</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I see the easy solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: recursive solution not required
 grateful_tomato: right, there were some interesting other solutions. Too bad Allis didn't share his code
 grateful_tomato: Of course, I probably wouldn't understand it anyway&#160;:-) 
 codestacking: Coding in C# ...where do I see the output for:
 jacek: well in the output of puzzle
 jacek: in red
 codestacking: I see it ...thanks
 NightScap3: Uhmm any where where I can add suggestions=
 NightScap3: Could we please have Kotlin Libraries instead of Java libraries when coding with Kotlin
 NightScap3: I was like literally dying
 evanmars: RIP
 PatrickMcGinnisII: finally a little sumptin sumptin  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/497739981">https://www.codingame.com/replay/497739981</a>
 Westicles: Nice job.  Just need to add in the numbers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 23%, darnit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not efficient
 PatrickMcGinnisII: good enuff for today, 50th
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx Westicles, I need all the props i can get
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall b good, can't b good, be good at it
 Majeck: Hullo

 strattan: Is the theme for fall challenge 2020 really Zelda or zelda-like?
 Majeck: It wouldn't suprise me if it were actually Zelda
 Majeck: They've done puzzles with Nintendo before
 StrikerXYZ: hi
 Majeck: CodinGame is awesome at doing stuff with big brands
 Majeck: Such as the Batman puzzles, Indiana Jones, etc
 strattan: I just see theme: Zelda in the email but I CTRL+F for Zelda on the fall challenge page and nothing. 
 strattan: Anyway what languages is everyone furthering at the moment?
 strattan: I think I want to do C++
 AlPaca: why not something fashionable? like rust?
 strattan: I keep hearing praise for Rust but I dont hold interest in it like those that praise it do
 strattan: Okay so this fall challenge theme based on the background is zelda witches I believe because when I save it the file is: Codin_zelda_witches_fr (2)
 strattan: and google gives me art based on these two for Zelda ocarina of time
 KiwiTae: strattan so much trouble ~ they said it in the trailer lol
 strattan: okay I see it in the description: "The goal is to write a program that is better at playing a defined new game (conceived by the CodinGame team) in the Zelda universe than other programs/bots written by the other contestants."
 KiwiTae: is it gonna be your first contest&#160;? hehe
 strattan: I think I signed up for another contest or two some years ago so technically not my first but my first in a long while.  
 JohnBrzenk: nice

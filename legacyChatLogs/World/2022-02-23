 Roseofanotherworld: Hello
 Ckim0512: I hate this
 Ckim0512: I dont understand anything
 Roseofanotherworld: what are you working on?
 Ckim0512: Well Im doing the mad pod racing but I need to work with python3 in which I have never used in my entire life, and well im inexperienced and have only used javascript
 Ckim0512: like how am i suppose to do something if i dont know or understand python
 Uljahn: you can choose another language
 Ckim0512: I was told to only use python
 Ckim0512: nothing more or nothing less
 Ckim0512: I could change it but I was told to python so idk
 Uljahn: you have to learn python first somewhere else
 Ckim0512: thats what im saying but i have never done it before and they told if you did java python should be okay
 Ckim0512: javascript
 Uljahn: eh?
 Ckim0512: ik it bs
 Ckim0512: I dont know what to do
 Uljahn: chill in the chat
 Ckim0512: yes i will
 Ckim0512: imma realize here for a while
 Ckim0512: anyone do video editing ik this is out of the blue
 YS_Yousef: XD I am playing now my contribute
 Andriamanitra: i have now solved the coin guessing game in ruby, python, haskell and D
 Andriamanitra: what next
 Ckim0512: show me how to do in python
 Andriamanitra: i used sets in python
 Andriamanitra: keep one set of possible even sides for each odd side and remove elements as you find out which ones are impossible
 Andriamanitra: when all those sets are of size 1 you are done
 I_love_CoC: Ckim0512 you could also use numpy.ones and put [i,j] a zero when even and odd don't pair each other
 MrZee: See I just made a coin object in C# to hold the odd and even and a list of possible evens, then assigned an odd number to each coin and once the list of possible evens went down to one I set its even to the remaining number

 6sdcuy: how to use thrust in mad pod?
 5DN1L: print it where you originally print the thrust value
 5DN1L: oops
 5DN1L: what do you mean???
 5DN1L: I thought you were asking about BOOST?
 6sdcuy: yep
 5DN1L: so my answer still holds, whew
 Ronins: Whep
 Ronins: Nobody there
 6sdcuy: i mean like the solution for first level
 5DN1L: what do you mean by first level
 5DN1L: Wood 3 or 2 or 1 League?
 Ronins: 1 league
 5DN1L: Not asking you Ronins
 6sdcuy: tutrotial boss
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy every league has a boss
 5DN1L: you can look at the top of the website and check for the league there
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3ba02e2a-ebcf-4317-b798-fcd1b87f54e2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3ba02e2a-ebcf-4317-b798-fcd1b87f54e2</a>
 5DN1L: top left
 5DN1L: not the coding area
 6sdcuy: oh wood 3 league
 kurtesy: GIL is hell
 5DN1L: ok. 6sdcuy
 6sdcuy: nvm
 5DN1L: i see that in your code you have print("1") near the bottom
 5DN1L: it's not needed
 5DN1L: if the pod is still not good enough, you may also try changing the thrust value from 50 to 100
 6sdcuy: so i print("100")?
 5DN1L: nope
 5DN1L: the whole code is just what it's intended to be like
 5DN1L: don't add any lines
 5DN1L: in this league, you're supposed to correct the last line only
 6sdcuy: isee
 Ronins: Hello there
 5DN1L: and 6sdcuy, every turn you're supposed to output three things to make your pod move
 5DN1L: x-coordinate
 5DN1L: y-coordinate
 5DN1L: thrust
 5DN1L: so just outputting 100 will result in an error
 5DN1L: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 50")
 5DN1L: ^ this is fine, but i'm saying that you may try changing 50 to 100 in that line if needed
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8a56dff1-c084-4c40-9599-8d62823978ec">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8a56dff1-c084-4c40-9599-8d62823978ec</a>
 5DN1L: you need the space before 100
 Andriamanitra: well that was quite a journey but i got my clojure solution for coin guessing game working :D
 5DN1L: wow
 5DN1L: good job
 5DN1L: i always find clojure very horrible to write
 Andriamanitra: thanks
 Andriamanitra: immutability makes things tricky
 5DN1L: all the brackets...
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/830b66fe-6beb-4d0e-b714-771209e65da5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/830b66fe-6beb-4d0e-b714-771209e65da5</a>
 5DN1L: yes 6sdcuy
 Andriamanitra: i don't mind the brackets themselves but i can never figure out how to properly format the code, like indentation and stuff
 Uljahn: here is more readable version:print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, 100)
 6sdcuy: ok thank you
 5DN1L: you're free with your indentation style i think, Andriamanitra lol
 Andriamanitra: well yeah the language doesn't care but it is quite hard for a human to follow :D
 Andriamanitra: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/LxUN2JZ.png">https://i.imgur.com/LxUN2JZ.png</a>
 5DN1L: yeah, that looks clear enough
 Andriamanitra: i don't like having so many different levels of indentation going up and down, i'm sure a more proficient clojurist could make it look nice
 DDP554: damn daniel
 5DN1L: DDP554 are you in the wrong channel?
 6sdcuy: can my pod be faster?
 5DN1L: Andriamanitra I'm not a proficient clojurist so i would just vote for the indentation you have lol
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2983b566-849d-4dbb-b5ab-a68a7b930ab4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2983b566-849d-4dbb-b5ab-a68a7b930ab4</a>
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy you have defined how thrust value should be changed in the if block, so you can use that in the print statement below
 Mortis_666: ughh I want to change the email for this account but I forget the password
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy, so instead of " 80", you use " " + thrust
 5DN1L: str(thrust) i mean
 6sdcuy: ok
 6sdcuy: after i change why it's still won't work
 6sdcuy:   print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + str(thrust))
 Uljahn: you need + " " + str(thrust))
 6sdcuy: not working either
 6sdcuy: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + "" + str( thrust))
 5DN1L: "" is not a space
 5DN1L: " " is a space
 6sdcuy: still the same
 5DN1L: what's your code now
 5DN1L: whole thing
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc2529fe-258a-4413-aae0-df63b2d937ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc2529fe-258a-4413-aae0-df63b2d937ee</a>
 5DN1L: thrust = 100 not 1000
 6sdcuy: oops haha forgot to change
 6sdcuy: is this how i use boost? print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " " + str( thrust) + " " + "BOOST")
 Alphyn: Hi everyone! Is there a way to see the current thrust value in debug? That would be more useful than current position.
 MrZee: Yeah, if you open the console it should show your output line every step of the way
 Andriamanitra: @6sdcuy you can write f"{next_checkpoint_x} {next_checkpoint_y} {thrust} BOOST" instead of all that str() and +" "+ nonsense
 5DN1L: better one step at a time :P
 Alphyn: 6sdcuy, no, you have to figure out how to replace thrust with boost at the right time
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy you don't output both a thrust value and BOOST
 5DN1L: you're allowed to output only one of them in a turn
 6sdcuy: ok
 5DN1L: and in the whole game you're allowed to use BOOST once only
 6sdcuy: ok then i think its better to use thrust then
 5DN1L: a boost is a more powerful thrust
 5DN1L: so I use boost in the first turn
 5DN1L: then i use normal thrusts in all the following turns
 Alphyn: ideally, you need to write a condition for the best time to use boost
 5DN1L: it's just my strategy, you can use yours
 6sdcuy: ok 
 MrZee: I think what I did was just make a thrust string and when I needed it to be a thrust I would have the thrust set to " 100" and when I needed it to boost I would have the string change to " BOOST" for just the one turn and use a bool to determine if boost was already used or not
 6sdcuy: ok
 5DN1L: as Uljahn mentioned earlier, in python, the easiest way to output is
 5DN1L: print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, thrust)
 5DN1L: then you need not worry about using str() or adding spaces
 5DN1L: spaces will be automatically added in between
 <b>**MrZee Sings The Space Between</b></p><p><img src="/a/74920308780308" /> 5DN1L: :clap:
 6sdcuy: is this how to use thurst and boost at a same time?
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0dc2a05-ee94-46c4-bc94-66567918f6d8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0dc2a05-ee94-46c4-bc94-66567918f6d8</a>
 5DN1L: your code contains 2 while loops?
 6sdcuy: so is that ok?
 5DN1L: nope, not ok
 6sdcuy: ok
 5DN1L: if you're following my strategy, then you use BOOST based on whether you are in the first turn or not
 5DN1L: instead of depending on the value of next_checkpoint_angle
 Alphyn: for that, you can just put thrust = "BOOST" before the loop
 Alphyn: but that will backfire if the first CP is really close.
 6sdcuy: how to use boost at when the check point is far ahead?
 Alphyn: you have the distance to the next checkpoint imput
 6sdcuy: ok
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf1c4596-e866-4d8e-aa5d-dc72a9991655">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf1c4596-e866-4d8e-aa5d-dc72a9991655</a>
 6sdcuy: wrong code

 5DN1L: delete the space before BOOST
 5DN1L: and you have to set b to False afterwards
 6sdcuy: ok i fogot
 5DN1L: b = True should be moved before the while loop
 6sdcuy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a61596f1-a05a-43dd-ac10-8243fa3aaaa6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a61596f1-a05a-43dd-ac10-8243fa3aaaa6</a>
 Alphyn: That doesn't make much sense to me, if you're going to use the boost only once at the start, why do you include it in the while loop to be checked every time&amp;
 Alphyn:&#160;?
 5DN1L: already amended
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy your code looks fine now
 MrZee: All that's left is to test, submit, and then make changes when you come up with ideas on how to make it navigate faster
 6sdcuy: but the pod and the boss is not moving
 Alphyn: I respectfully disagree&#160;:)  I think the entire "if b == True:" block is redundant
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy what does the console say
 MrZee: What would you propose as a substitute to make sure it only runs on the first loop?
 Alphyn: You have an extra space before thrust output, 6
 6sdcuy: ok it works when i test on arena 
 6sdcuy: but in the test area it won't
 5DN1L: Alphyn that extra space is not relevant
 MrZee: You may need to refresh the page, that happens sometimes
 6sdcuy: oh ok then
 6sdcuy: how to go to bronze league
 6sdcuy: i already reah rank 1
 6sdcuy: on wood league 1
 MrZee: Git gud enough lol, jk, there's a boss in the arena leaderboard. Once the arena is done processing if you beat the boss it'll move you up
 MrZee: But the arena process takes a minute, you can see a percentage below the playing screen after you submit
 Alphyn: Here
 Alphyn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Mb6dSyb4">https://pastebin.com/Mb6dSyb4</a>
 6sdcuy: oh ok
 6sdcuy: but i defeated the boss
 6sdcuy: ok nvm
 Alphyn: oh, ok, I now see how I'm wrong
 Uljahn: Alphyn: it'll never boost
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy you can see the progress of your races by clicking LAST BATTLES on the left
 MrZee: Ok lol, I was honestly interested if you had a way
 Alphyn: thrust will be overwritten before it can be printed, yes
 5DN1L: 6sdcuy when the races are running don't submit your code again otherwise you will have all to do all the races again
 6sdcuy: man i submit the code again xd
 5DN1L: yeah i know :P
 5DN1L: Now sit back and wait
 5DN1L: you can click a few battles to watch
 MrZee: It can give some good insight on how to make your code better if you can figure out what other people's pods are doing
 5DN1L: better do that in Bronze instead of now, though
 MrZee: Yeeeeaaaaahhhhh
 Alphyn: I'm trying to implement some braking before reaching the checkpoint logic but I feel it only makes it worse&#160;:)
 MrZee: One of the tactics I used that got me through a few leagues was to use the first lap to build a list of every checkpoint location so in the 2nd and 3rd lap I could target the next checkpoint just before reaching the current one. It's tricky to get the timing right, but it helps a lot
 Alphyn: That dude I'm up against never bales lol and does a better job lol
 Alphyn: Thanks for the advice, it sounds a bit advanced, but interesting
 MrZee: Is discussing strategies ok on here, or is it preferred to just let other people come up with their own ideas?
 5DN1L: it's ok
 5DN1L: just don't share whole code
 MrZee: Cool
 derjack: or, target next checkpoint - your current velocity
 Alphyn: when do you unlock the velocity input?
 MrZee: Yeah, Wontonimo gave me that advice and that also helped a bunch
 MrZee: You have to calculate it yourself
 MrZee: In gold they give it to you, but before then, you have to do your own calculations
 Alphyn: but how do you take into account collisions with the other ships?
 MrZee: I think it's silver or bronze when they get collisions and when they do you get input for enemy positions
 6sdcuy: whats the diffferent between ND and TH
 6sdcuy: in ranks
 Alphyn: That's definitely over my paygrade, lol&#160;:)
 6sdcuy: wdym
 Alphyn: I mean, I'
 Alphyn: I'm still a beginner and calculating velocity taking into account the collisions is definitely far too complex for me
 6sdcuy: whats the real word of ND and TH?
 MrZee: Velocity would be your current position minus the position you were on the last loop so you'd have to track x velocity and y velocity and then subtract them from the x checkpoint and y checkpoint
 MrZee: Not sure about the ND or TH, I don't recall seeing those
 Uljahn: 6sdcuy: 2nd, 3rd, 4th
 derjack: oO
 Alphyn: Am I seeing this right? You're in the first place in Bronze, 6sdcuy?
 Alphyn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/WnJWYxb">https://imgur.com/a/WnJWYxb</a>
 derjack: and above the boss
 Alphyn: Now don't touch anything for 12 h 40 m lol
 Papeta: gg
 MrZee: Looking at the general leaderboard, they're in silver now
 MrZee: I didn't even realize until I looked at the general leaderboard that there's a scoring system lol
 5DN1L: what do you mean by scoring system
 MrZee: The TrueSkill number
 5DN1L: ah that
 5DN1L: ok
 Alphyn: Now I'm the number 1 in Bronze somehow
 Alphyn: up from 20 000
 Alphyn: I think the trick is to only ever race the boss, not other dudes at the arena
 MrZee: Did you submit your code to the arena at all?
 Alphyn: By pressing Test in Arena?
 MrZee: Yes
 Uljahn: btw leagues prior to gold are considered tutorial and then the real game starts (same rules as in the contest) :smirk:
 MrZee: Oh yeah, I had to scrap all of my code and start over when I got to gold lol
 Alphyn: Yeah, I raced a bunch of guys, my winrate fell to 20%, and then I started testing the same code against the boss and somehow it's 83% now. It doesn't make much sense.
 MrZee: The arena keeps going even if you click off of it
 Uljahn: ye, arena matchmaking is automated
 Alphyn: Then it looks like my braking code works, lol 
 Alphyn: Ok, does my ship at the arena use the version of code I had when I last pressed the test in Arena button? Or is it auto-updated with the current version?
 MrZee: It keeps using the last code you submitted
 Alphyn: Do you know If I can see it? I used to be really good 20 minutes ago before I started fixing it.
 Alphyn: NVM
 Alphyn: It's in the history tab
 Alphyn: and yeah, it's the simplest version, without the braking
 Yoonshan: is there a way to debug in the ide?
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: the default code normally tells you how
 Yoonshan: I mean the lazy way, not by writing tons of WriteLine
 5DN1L: what's the lazy way
 Yoonshan: one breakpoint and you can highlight any variables to show their output
 Yoonshan: stepwise
 5DN1L: probably not
 Yoonshan: damn it
 Idk.-_-: hi everyone
 Alphyn: Hi!
 MrZee: I think I'm getting  close to a code that'll get me into legend league in Mad Pod!
 struct: o.o
 struct: did you write a sim for it?
 struct: or are you doing heuristics?
 MrZee: It's not finished yet, but what I have so far got me to rank 512 in gold. I haven't even implemented the boost yet
 MrZee: I'm just out of time for writing code for the day so I'll have to finish tomorrow
 MrZee: I kind of sort of reverse engineered the boss pod lmao
 paulo-e: I hope everyone here has a great day
 MrZee: You too!

 Ninjatron: is there a way to join reverse only clashes?
 jacek: just join a clash and dont read any statement. that way it will always be reverse to you :v
 Ninjatron: bro your jokes are really bad :D
 jacek: jokes?
 5DN1L: jacek 💯
 Magmi: I would also like to join only reverse/speed clashes
 Magmi: minimal size code clashes are just stupid
 HarrisonW: yes....
 HarrisonW: i agree......
 Ninjatron: i think they are harmless, might be helpful if you want to develop your dynamic language skills
 Ninjatron: i just want to continue in game map thing, and I don't want to play 50 clashes until i get to win 3 reverse clashes
 Ninjatron: but other than that, shortest code contests can only benefit Python coders in competitions, good luck winning with static typed languages
 Magmi: Not even python
 Magmi: Ruby is the choice if you want to be good at it
 Magmi: Python is OK, but not the best. 
 Ninjatron: is that so? idk never saw a ruby coder here lol
 Magmi: It is not a stupid concept, but it should be separated 
 Magmi: Yeah man Ruby is unbeatable in short code, I mean ini most of the problems Ruby just can not be beaten
 Magmi: man

 Magmi: man
 Magmi: did u get job at Google because of this site&lt;
 Magmi:&#160;?
 Xenoid: It was one factor of many
 Xenoid: I mean I found the practice here to be helpful. I also really like some of the contests. They helped to get me interested in learning more about other types of programming after I left a job in 2017

 NachoJudas: I've rebooted and tried a different browser but the problem persists. I'm currently doing Crystal Rush.
 NachoJudas: Recently promoted to Silver League. Does that have anything to do with it? i.e. less debugging tools to make it harder.

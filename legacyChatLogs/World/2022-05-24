 Leeward: Good morning, how do I report inappropriate comments?
 nicola: Where are they?
 Leeward: On a community contribution
 nicola: Send the link, please.
 Leeward: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/163181703507dde1d0104bd2b98c1552ca399">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/163181703507dde1d0104bd2b98c1552ca399</a>
 nicola: You can open the offender’s profile and report it.
 Leeward: I already did but that didn't seem to do anything so I thought I'd check if I did the right thing.
 Leeward: Thank you.
 5DN1L: I'll delete it too
 nicola: Reported.
 5DN1L: Thanks nicola, just about to do the same
 nicola: :thumbsup:
 nicola: You can also complain on Discord if the moderators linger.
 Leeward: Thanks a lot&#160;:)
 nicola: If you see other such comments by the same guy…
 Leeward: I looked for some in a few of the submissions around mine but apparently I was the only target :shrug:
 Leeward: No idea why, never interacted with that person
 Leeward: Just found two more inappropriate comments by other randoms though

 5DN1L: oh dear...
 5DN1L: thanks for reporting
 Leeward: No problem, happy to
 nicola: 5DN1L, do you report the offenders?
 5DN1L: i will. and i think thibaud has a way to track them down too
 nicola: :thumbsup:
 nicola: I reported the first two ones.
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 5DN1L: It's almost impossible for us to check every comment like this. I think Thibaud should be able to extract all such comments in a database
 Leeward: If it were possible for users to report individual comments, the reports could be added to a moderation queue? The problem then becomes abuse so you'd need quotas etc to control it
 Ayza: A report feature for levels 10+ or something would sound like a good idea
 Leeward: Yes that sounds reasonable, if there's a high threshold for being able to report at all then abuse should be minimal
 Leeward: found another one, even though it's a joke about the submitter's pfp it's in poor taste and contributes nothing. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/145357388aea5f97a134ed41372fab3fc575a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/145357388aea5f97a134ed41372fab3fc575a</a>

 5DN1L: Thanks, also reported and deleted.
 caz1x: Should store all these in a dataset and make a challenge to detect as many from the set as possible :P  would also serve as a hall of shame heh

 aangairbender: do you guys know if any rust crate features are enabled on cg?e.g. smallrand feature will allow to use XorShift random generator from rand crate
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>
 aangairbender: jacek thank you, I know this page, I was asking about extra info
 jacek: can you try to use it
 Gloopy: For instance, you can use SmallRng from rand::rngs in Rust on CG
 aangairbender: Gloopy I cannot use it by default, it's available only when cargo feature is enabled
 Gloopy: It is already installer with Rust 1.60 distrib
 Gloopy: *installed
 Gloopy: in mean, on CIG
 joey12: HELP ME BEAT BOSS TWO PLZ
 aangairbender: Gloopy use rand::rngs::SmallRand;unresolved import
 aangairbender: other rngs are available (like threadrng, stdrng)
 Gloopy: In the editor but does the code compile&#160;?
 aangairbender: no, I said error[E0432]: unresolved import `rand::rngs::SmallRand`
 jacek: no rand for you then. be more deterministic
 struct: thats on ide
 struct: but it compiles
 struct: intellisense is broken
 struct: for rust on ide
 aangairbender: struct that's from stderr after pressing Play my code
 aangairbender: wait a sec
 aangairbender: well, it works
 Gloopy: I am pretty sure I am using it in UTTT
 aangairbender: Okay, thank you. It worked eventually. Are there any other hidden gems like this?
 struct: yes its just intellisense
 struct: I would use a local ide aangairbender
 Gloopy: Yes, check the language page in which you have the installed crates
 jacek: UTTT eh
 aangairbender: struct I am using local ide, but I don't  know the cargo config. I copied dependencies from faq, but things like enabled features are not specified there
 aangairbender: I just want my local ide to be same as CG
 struct: cant you add dependencies to a file?
 struct: Im just asking I dont really use rust
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480205/how-do-you-enable-a-rust-crate-feature#58480230">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480205/how-do-you-enable-a-rust-crate-feature#58480230</a>
 aangairbender: struct the problem is I dont know which ones to enable. CG doesnt specify that
 struct: isnt it this?
 struct: chrono 0.4.19, itertools 0.10.0, libc 0.2.93,rand 0.8.3, regex 1.4.5, time 0.2.26
 struct: or do you need more than that?
 aangairbender: e.g. rand crate has some code which is available only when specific feature is enabled
 aangairbender: yes, version is not enough, enabled features is another thing
 aangairbender: e.g. SmallRand doesnt work by default
 struct: ah
 Gloopy: rand = { version = "0.8.3", features = ["small_rng"] }
 Gloopy: for the others, just add the version
 aangairbender: Gloopy I know how to enable specific feature, I dont know how to fetch all enabled features in CG environment
 aangairbender: rust SmallRng (which is xorshit) is twice faster than my impl of xorshift:sweat_smile:
 jacek: w00t
 jacek: do you use modulo for range
 aangairbender: I use impl from wiki
 aangairbender: anyway, no reason to use mine, SmallRng is already superfast
 jacek: this is faster <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/221/">https://xkcd.com/221/</a>
 Gloopy: Simple curiosity, on which Puzzle would you need a faster implem&#160;?
 aangairbender: SmallRng generates 100k of u32 in 65ns
 jacek: you need many randoms in mcts
 aangairbender: Gloopy there is no specific puzzle, I just doing some benchmarking
 Gloopy: Well, then on CIG SmallRng is fast enough from my experience
 aangairbender: my uttt bot with mcts is 239 legend with ThreadRng (which is 2.5x slower than SmallRng)
 aangairbender: I will try to change it to smallrng
 aangairbender: okay it gave around +3% of playouts
 jacek: :tada: so it will be top10?
 aangairbender: nah, not yet:sweat_smile:
 struct: this is what I use on my c++ bot

 frog225: average java script user
 misaelidk: HTML5 solos no diff
 frog225: common L by misaelidk
 frog225: python solos your favorite verse
 Dono1: Does anyone know what the secret validators are on Ghost Legs?
 misaelidk: html is fun while python is torture
 j4at: trolls :grimacing:
 therealbeef: how many contests are won by python?
 Dono1: Specifically validators 4 and 5 on Ghost Legs. I can't pass them but I don't know what the problem is
 misaelidk: dono1the adults are talking
 frog225: people who dont use python prob dont shower
 Dono1: Seems like they're typing.
 misaelidk: who actually puts periods at the ends of your sentences
 misaelidk: weird
 Dono1: You do you, I'm just wondering if anyone knows about those validators.
 frog225: fr only thing misael is right about
 misaelidk: bro deff send texts in letter format
 frog225: dono you could solve it if you used python
 therealbeef: validators are generally unknown (otherwise you could hardcode their solutions)
 Ayza: cool trolls made the chat active
 misaelidk: i love that movie
 Dono1: I'm aware that they are unknown, that's why I'm asking if anyone has knowledge of them, gained by completing the challenge.
 Snorl4xxer: Nah, Misael. Punctuation is cool. Remember kids, stay in school.
 misaelidk: this man looked in the thesarus to make himself sound smart
 frog225: stay in my basement

 misaelidk: 24.104.69.238
 Ayza: Dono1, the only way to see validators is by looking at the original submission
 Ayza: otherwise there is no way
 therealbeef: you can reverse engineer some validators but it requires a lot of tedious work, so there's no real point
 Ayza: exactly, just follow the instructions on what you're missing
 frog225: pooh shiesty probably uses c++ 
 frog225: anyone else love men
 5DN1L: kicked
 5DN1L: next is a ban

 Darleanow: one of a loop concept&#160;:)
 Darleanow: like to avoid timeouts
 j4at: Well, If you get same number twice then its an infinite loop
 Scarfield: ah fair enough Darleanow thought you were trolling&#160;:)
 5DN1L: it's more about detecting loops or detecting cycles
 Darleanow: Scarfield, ofc no&#160;!! but i'm a self taught, i mean 5DN1L and some others there taught, so i miss a couple of basics
 Darleanow: since obviously they can't give me courses u know
 Darleanow: j4at okok i'll try 
 Scarfield: yea me too, i thought you meant you didnt understand the game loop, which would be weird as lvl 13&#160;:)
 Darleanow: Scarfield understandable xD 
 Ayza: if you get the same numbers you can tell it's an infinite loop
 Ayza: but if the case is your algorithm is taking too long, I doubt you can I think
 NinjaZMY: sometimes the result isn't linear so I don't know if there's a way to figure out if the loop is endless
 Darleanow: i could like append results to a list$
 NinjaZMY: my method would be to debug everything and try to comprehend the behavior of your program 
 Darleanow: and for each new iteration, i'll try to see if it's in the list already, if it is, it would break
 Darleanow: but i guess that sometimes it could take time
 j4at: use a set instead
 NinjaZMY: I see what you meant Darleanow 
 Darleanow: as they don't take duplicates j4at&#160;?
 Ayza: yeah, you could check if the length of the set is 1
 j4at: Finding if a number in a set is O(1)
 Ayza: because if it's always the same number then it would be 1
 NinjaZMY: guys I haven't learnt complexity yet 
 Darleanow: but for lists is also O(1)&#160;???
 Darleanow: as its a linear search
 j4at: Nope it's O(n)
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/python-lists-vs-sets-39bd6b5745e1">https://towardsdatascience.com/python-lists-vs-sets-39bd6b5745e1</a>
 Ayza: best case: O(1)worst case: O(n)
 Scarfield: you need to loop through a list, it wont be sorted (unless you sort it yourself), so something less than O8n) on avg
 NinjaZMY: I googled O(1) 
 Ayza: worst case where the item is not in the list or as it at the end
 Ayza: source google
 Scarfield: O(n)*
 Ayza: or it's*
 NinjaZMY: what's the best way to learn complexity&#160;?
 Scarfield: i just checked my solution, i just used a list, but a set i definately better
 Darleanow: youtube ig ninja
 Darleanow: okay i'll try with a set
 Darleanow: myset=set(())
 Darleanow: for now i have this
 Darleanow: when u read it, remove indent from while
 Darleanow: z=[str(int(i)*int(i)) for i in str(z)]
 Darleanow: updated it
 j4at: you can do x**2 instead of x*x
 Darleanow: yeah mb, it's just a convention for me lol
 Darleanow: LMAOOOO
 Darleanow: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 j4at: nice gj
 Darleanow: it wasnt working because forgot that type of z was int
 Darleanow: and i was checking for "1" instead of 1
 NinjaZMY: I can solve complex problems but I fail to grasp complexity which I'll need to learn I guess
 j4at: NinjaZMY

 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek Diablo reference...on point
 jacek: or pointer :thinking:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Find the Winning Strategy kicked my butt for 2 1/2 days.  Ended up with 19 lines of code...wth
 j4at: taco
 Espequair: is there a way to select a type of CoC? only reverse or something?
 Ayza: you can only do that in private clashes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Hmm, converted Winning Strat code to java and found out most people came up with same answer
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php people didnt
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wierd
 j4at: yeah php users are not that smart
 j4at: just kidding  :D
 I_LOVE_MY_BROTHER: how to print something just to check the value?
 I_LOVE_MY_BROTHER: in c#
 Ayza: print it to the error stream
 j4at: It's in a comment
 Ayza: not sure how you do it in c# though
 j4at: To debug: Console.Error.WriteLine("Debug messages...");

 Darleanow: py&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can read so many langs, but PY gives me a headache...and perl ofc 
 Darleanow: perl is cheated
 Darleanow: like you can do too much with 3 chars lmao
 Darleanow: but look man 
 Darleanow: isnt it cute&#160;??&#160;:

 Darleanow: couldve make it looking better, but no its easily readable enough
 Espequair: anybody want to do private reverse clashes until I can grind out this 3 shortest win thingy?
 j4at: sure
 jacek: i dont think quest map counts private clashes
 j4at: yeah
 Husoski: The leaderboard counts them, though.
 j4at: it does&#160;?
 Husoski: I joined a "Fastest" late once and lost over 20 positions in the ranking when everyone else was done before I got started!
 Ayza: are you sure it wasn't another clash which you did before it?
 Ayza: It never counted for me
 Husoski: Positive.
 j4at: let's test it 
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/241409064866b0bfbd2ff29efc7a7523ba4e2bf">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/241409064866b0bfbd2ff29efc7a7523ba4e2bf</a>
 Husoski: Not me.  Been there, got the t-shirt.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my quest map for clashes is kinda lacking...stuck at win 3 reverses
 Espequair: it's the shortest that mess me over
 Espequair: can't luck into winning them
 Espequair: and they're *rare*
 Espequair: so the best hope is late night farming, try to get as little people as you can and pray
 Neon_Tuts: Hello World
 CRE1330: Personnaly, I think it's really hard for beginners to solve problems. Am I the only one in this situation or not&#160;? 
 CRE1330: *personnally. 
 Espequair: depends, are you starting with the easy ones?
 CRE1330: I follow the paths' quest. For example I've done the Mars Request (concerning conditions). 
 CodingLearner2: i dont know how to code 
 CodingLearner2: any advice?
 CRE1330: there are some lessons about the code you're interested in. For instance, I follow Python lesson for beginners. 
 Neon_Tuts: CS50
 CodingLearner2: is this site for experts?
 VirtualRealityRocks: It's kind of intermediate-advanced
 CodingLearner2: oh, does anyone have a website where it is not advance? 
 MSmits: it can also be experts. We do easy things here, but we also do cutting edge things here, in some cases
 VirtualRealityRocks: If you want a beginner website, try Excercism
 MSmits: I've seen people do things better than what I read in scientific papers sometimes
 VirtualRealityRocks: If you want an even harder website, Leetcode is a good choice.
 MSmits: is that a fair comparison though? Does Leetcode have bot arena's?
 CodingLearner2: Thank you VirtualRealityRocks!
 Wizard-Dude: no, leetcode does not have a bot arena, but there are also 2-hour weekly and biweekly  contest.
 MSmits: yeah, my point is that CG is unique and hard to compare with other websites. 
 VirtualRealityRocks: True
 MSmits: other websites have mostly coding problems to solve
 MSmits: like codeforces
 MSmits: you try to solve a problem as efficiently as possible in the least amount of time
 MSmits: I prefer botgames though. They also can be as hard as your opponents will make it and we have some really strong opponents here
 MSmits: (these are mostly top 10-20 in an arena)
 struct: puzzles are harder for me
 struct: but thats because I have less experience on them
 struct: MSmits on PCR if two chips with same radius collide is it handled as a collision?
 NinjaZMY: I just finished watching this video: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk</a> does that mean now I have knowledge about O(n), O(1) and O(n²) 
 NinjaZMY: or Do I need to learn more&#160;? 
 struct: Well judging by the title I guess he explained it
 NinjaZMY: concerning complexity is  O(n), O(1) and O(n²) are everything that I need to know&#160;? 
 Newblord88: theres log based complexity as well
 NinjaZMY: yeah I was wondering about that 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no, n logn
 NinjaZMY: do I need to learn the log and n logn complexity 
 NinjaZMY:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or is it n ln n
 struct: I would learn as you go
 NinjaZMY: what do you mean sir @struct&#160;? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for working at MS?  nah
 struct: I think the important part is to understand complexity
 struct: You can check log n complexity and others
 struct: But you will understand it faster now
 NinjaZMY: Basically I could understand basic things about complexity before learning about the big O 
 NinjaZMY: do you guys have any recommendations or ressources or videos I can watch to learn that&#160;? 
 NinjaZMY: and the purpose of learning complexity it to make a more efficient code right&#160;? 
 Newblord88: correct
 Newblord88: by understanding hte complexity of your code you should essentially be able to identify what parts can be improved 
 Newblord88: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2307283/what-does-olog-n-mean-exactly#:~:text=Logarithmic%20running%20time%20(%20O(log,an%20O(log%20n)%20time">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2307283/what-does-olog-n-mean-exactly#:~:text=Logarithmic%20running%20time%20(%20O(log,an%20O(log%20n)%20time</a>
 Newblord88: check out that link, has a pretty good explanation of the different time complexities 
 NinjaZMY: thank you Newblord88
 NinjaZMY: I can do speedreading believe it or don't, Anyway, I read the information from stackoverflow link, I still believe I need to learn more 
 NinjaZMY: Especially, that I remember that on a certain website used to recrute programmers, I had to solve a question about the big O notation, it was more complex than a simple O(log^2 n )question  
 NinjaZMY: I didn't know the correct answer myself 
 NinjaZMY: I personally forgot the question itself 
 NinjaZMY: from stackoverflow I could understand that O(log^2 n ) is related to binary trees, since a binary tree has 2 "childs" 
 NinjaZMY: or something like that 
 NinjaZMY: so the size of the binary tree would follow the rule of 2^n
 NinjaZMY: in the same quizz I had to know some algorithms like&#160;: "divide and conquer" which I still don't know at the time , Even though I scored a high score on the quizz 
 NinjaZMY: Which I still don't know*
 waterproofsodium: gm
 NinjaZMY: waterproofsodium what does gm mean&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly good morning
 NinjaZMY: cool 
 NinjaZMY: it's night over here 
 NinjaZMY: does code in game teach you stuff, if you follow the home graph&#160;? 
 waterproofsodium: or good mode
 waterproofsodium: *god mode
 Darleanow: NinjaZMY I've earned a lot&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: it's night?
 Darleanow: mostly on coc i'd say
 waterproofsodium: gm NinjaZMY
 NinjaZMY: hello waterproofsodium
 Darleanow: lmfao
 NinjaZMY: Darleanow if I follow the algorithms route will I encounter all the possible things that I'll eventually have to learn 
 Darleanow: i just wrote the most uneficient code
 Darleanow: like

 Darleanow: prob idk,
 Darleanow: i'm still on easy puzzles
 Darleanow: but maybe you should try another website
 Darleanow: to learn the very basics of a language
 Darleanow: dunno for how long u've been coding
 Darleanow: But if you're really new and code in python or c, have a look at programmiz
 Darleanow: or either geeks for geeks
 Darleanow: or w3schools
 Darleanow: but as i can see, if it's C&#160;: all of the above
 Darleanow: You'll find Js on w3school
 Darleanow: but very basic, at least what i've found
 Darleanow: **sorry for spam**
 VirtualRealityRocks: NinjaZMY no you will not. Definitely not. you will learn some things, but not close to everything you'll have to learn.
 NinjaZMY: I started coding 10 years ago, I just didn't manage to learn everything concerning algorithms  
 Darleanow: okay then if u know the basics
 Darleanow: stay there
 NinjaZMY: I solved complex problems before etc... (not on this website) 
 Darleanow: if u have any websites to learn deeper, tell me in pm&#160;:)
 Darleanow: ive started coding 2-3 months agp
 NinjaZMY: that's cool 
 j4at: you can try leetcode
 NinjaZMY: I found some interesting stuff in leetcode
 NinjaZMY: but the leetcode thing is that they don't have a course about complexity 
 Darleanow: thanks j4at&#160;:)
 Ayza: started exactly 1 year ago
 Ayza: with mosh's python video lol
 NinjaZMY: I've seen you before Ayza maybe in a clash of code I don't know 
 Darleanow: *heart*
 Ayza: you probably seen me on the chat here
 NinjaZMY: probably 
 Darleanow: ppl in coc who're like more than lvl 20 do be scary to me lol
 NinjaZMY: If I can do codeingame I'll easily reach lvl 20 
 NinjaZMY: daily*
 NinjaZMY: If I can do it daily/
 j4at: coc doesn't effect lvl that much
 Darleanow: yeah ik&#160;!
 Darleanow: but i mean a lvl 20 did kind of a lot of puzzles
 Darleanow: idk which puzzle i should do next 
 NinjaZMY: Actually I'm able to teach newbies code 
 Darleanow:&#160;:/
 NinjaZMY: I just want to become more efficient and better 
 Darleanow: some1 do be having ideas&#160;?
 NinjaZMY: ideas about what&#160;?
 Darleanow: easy puzzles to do&#160;:)
 Ayza: try this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/logic-gates">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/logic-gates</a>
 Darleanow: i'm searching for a new one, but i can make a choice
 NinjaZMY: stick to clash of code and aim to be first 
 Darleanow: already did it&#160;:)
 NinjaZMY: in clash of code you find random puzzles 
 Darleanow: Ninja, i'm still a beginner&#160;:)
 Ayza: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/fax-machine</a>
 NinjaZMY: yeah challenge yourself 
 Darleanow: and i've did like more than 500:)
 Ayza: that?
 Darleanow: Did it too&#160;:)
 Ayza: hmm
 j4at: Solve all easy puzzles
 j4at: by order
 NinjaZMY: Darleanow you can do a clash of code and aim to be first, if you don't finish in time, try to solve the problem on your own ( locally ) 
 Darleanow: the first ones are a bit hard for me
 Ayza: did you do 1d bush fire?
 Darleanow: NinjaZMY, i just skip some of them containing ascii&#160;:)
 Darleanow: NOPE
 Darleanow: nice
 Ayza: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-bush-fire">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-bush-fire</a>
 Darleanow: thanks bro
 Ayza: yw
 Darleanow: imma get a cig brb&#160;:)
 NinjaZMY: you should then do a one with ascii; Darleanow, time to learn ascii I guess 
 Darleanow: ahahha
 Ayza: It's easy once you've understood the logic
 Darleanow: i know very basics
 Darleanow: but like the fact that CG isnt accepting answers with a space at right is annoyinh
 Darleanow: or they want u to put one, idk if u get what i'm trying to say
 Ayza: everytime I do a clash I get an ascii art or mathematical problem
 Ayza: hated clashing ever since lol
 Darleanow: aahhaha
 NinjaZMY: in my first exam of algorithms when I first started learning programming I had  an ascii problem, while the teacher didn't teach it in class and they expect us to know it ,&#160;:'( 
 Darleanow: i love maths
 Darleanow: i mean i can do it Ninja
 Darleanow: some of them
 Darleanow: bc i know a bit
 Darleanow: but i don't like working with it
 Darleanow: rather a good math problem
 Darleanow: or some algo&#160;:)
 NinjaZMY: I love math too 
 Darleanow: but i'm bad at it&#160;:)
 Darleanow: was a bad kid when in high school
 Darleanow: so was like never going to math courses
 Darleanow: and now i regret it xD
 Darleanow: so i'm doing some on my own to get back up in the train
 NinjaZMY: in My country they taught mathematics really good 
 Darleanow: i mean it's also the professor u have
 Darleanow: and the type of high school you're in
 NinjaZMY: but not in college; in college it depends on who's the teacher 
 Darleanow: i'm in college rn ig&#160;??
 Darleanow: its like after you're 18 right&#160;?
 NinjaZMY: I finished college 
 NinjaZMY: yeah
 Ayza: agreed darlean, the regret when you realize it's too late to remember your past classes lol
 NinjaZMY: yeah it happened to me 
 NinjaZMY: if you're a beginner you should comprehend algorithms and learn how to solve problems 
 NinjaZMY: you'll eventually learn the language syntax 
 NinjaZMY: Ayza in one year you seem to have accomplished a lot of awesome stuff 
 NinjaZMY: did you learn everything about complexity and data structures, first&#160;? 
 Ayza: nope I didn't get into data structures from the start
 Ayza: didn't care about it as a beginner
 Ayza: got into it later
 NinjaZMY: I see 
 NinjaZMY: what about complexity&#160;? 
 Ayza: learned complexity not so long ago
 NinjaZMY: do you a have a ressource to recommend, I seem to lacking some knowledge about Time complexity, memory and other stuff 
 NinjaZMY: to be lacking*
 Darleanow: i'm learning complexity too&#160;!!!
 Ayza: you could check this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw&amp;t=370s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw&amp;t=370s</a>
 Darleanow: I think i've learned about data structures but i aint sure&#160;:'
 Ayza: It's a pretty good channel for learning algorithms
 Ayza: or to be specific the videos by that girl
 Darleanow: oh nvm, i already know about data strucutres
 NinjaZMY: Ayza does the channel has many videos about complexity&#160;?
 Ayza: well, not the channel but the videos of that girl
 Ayza: she covers trees, tries, dynamic programming, time complexity, etc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh lord.  Look at the wiki on sorting algorithms...you can compare O notations of each
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm</a>
 Ayza: I mean, complexity is not really a big topic so
 Ayza: most of the videos you'll find are 8-15 minutes long
 Ayza: one video should be enough to understand it
 NinjaZMY: I wanted to learn about O( log^2 n )
 NinjaZMY: and other types like O(n!*n²)
 waterproofsodium: i'll lose CP sigh
 NinjaZMY: what's CP&#160;?
 Ayza: codinpoints
 waterproofsodium: CP is life :O

 Darleanow: but for fire like f.f
 Darleanow: its not working xD
 Ayza: lol don't worry had me stuck aswell at first
 Darleanow: mmmmmmmmmmh
 Ayza: think about covering a certain group of indexes
 Darleanow: but i'm splitting them
 Darleanow: OH I SEE
 Ayza: f is always in the middle
 Ayza: so it covers what's after it and what's before it
 Darleanow: i had an idea at first
 Darleanow: but it sucked
 Darleanow: this one's kinda hard
 Darleanow: i've got an idez
 Darleanow: like comparing indexes 3 by 3
 Darleanow: i think it would work
 Ayza: try it
 Ayza: someone solved this with one line of regex lol
 Ayza: insane
 Darleanow: re.findall('...',line)
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 Darleanow: i have a start of one

 Darleanow: yup
 Darleanow: but going wrong if line%3!=0
 Darleanow: ff.ff returns 1
 Darleanow: bc of findall'...'
 NinjaZMY: how do you copy your code and make a pastebin&#160;?
 Darleanow: just ctrl c ctrl v
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 Ayza: it'll automatically paste it as a pastebin
 Ayza: if the code is too long
 Ayza: idk the limit
 Darleanow: 3 lines or more idk
 Darleanow: it's so annoying
 Darleanow: can't figure on how to solve it 
 Darleanow: using reg&#160;;'
 Ayza: no need to use reg
 Ayza: I solved it without reg
 NinjaZMY: Guys Reg is really useful right&#160;? 
 Darleanow: 10000000000%
 Darleanow: its like
 Darleanow: a bit hard in my opinion
 NinjaZMY: cause I never properly learned it 
 Darleanow: but helps way too much in way too many situations
 Darleanow: i will like get a week to learn this deep
 NinjaZMY: I remember using reg once or twice
 NinjaZMY: But I never properly learnt it 
 NinjaZMY: do you have any recommendation 
 NinjaZMY: a link I can follow to properly learn it
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.pyregex.com/">http://www.pyregex.com/</a>
 Darleanow: boom cheatsheet
 NinjaZMY: the same syntax for different languages&#160;?
 Darleanow: not sure&#160;:/
 Ayza: yeah, regex is regex
 NinjaZMY: I'll try to google it 
 NinjaZMY: normally it doesn't change
 NinjaZMY: I always thought it was a pain so didn't try to learn it

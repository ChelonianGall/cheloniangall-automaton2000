 HolySkull_1ad8: hi
 Thorcode: hi
 jacek: oh they already gave notification about puzzle of the week
 Thorcode: @Jacek have you finished the ascll Art
 jacek: yes
 Thorcode: could you help me 
 Thorcode: how to take the character in 
 Thorcode: for i in range(h):
 Thorcode: Just tell me how to do it
 Thorcode: oh
 jacek: you have to save rows in some 2d array, then read letters from that array
 Thorcode: I know
 Thorcode: how to print the letter from the last line
 Thorcode: gosh this is hard
 Uljahn: print(row[start:end]) ezpz
 knyzorg: How do people get out of silver <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/crystal-rush">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/crystal-rush</a>
 knyzorg: Absolutely brutal
 Thorcode: is in chuck norris
 Thorcode: we change the value into ASCII characters then to binary? 
 Uljahn: yep, find ASCII value of a character, then convert to 7-bit binary
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I change it to 2bit value
 Thorcode: es = <i>.join(format(ord(i), '08b') for i in s)</i>
 Thorcode: what happend to my code
 Thorcode: why it doesn't pas
 Uljahn: re-read the statement, there's more to that
 Thorcode: gosh I must change number 1 to zero too
 Thorcode: this puzzle is hard&#160;:(
 Uljahn: it's fine, you can learn a lot while solving it
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: unary is not better than binary
 littlebear: can i change color theme in editor&#160;?
 gilufin: yes in the setting on the left
 littlebear: oh
 littlebear: i meant theme like monokai, one dark pro
 gilufin: Idk
 littlebear: ok
 Thorcode: could you guy help me the TEMPERATURES puzzle
 derjack: ask the question
 BlaiseEbuth: Who's the question?
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: why i can't use min
 Thorcode: import numpy as npfor i in input().split():
 Thorcode: I even try to use np
 derjack: t is int, not array
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: I'm stupid
 Thorcode: how can i convert the - number to + number
 derjack: abs()
 Thorcode: thanks
 Thorcode: how can i find the 2 biggest number in python
 mcks: max()?
 Thorcode: max only 1 number
 mcks: you could sort and select the last two maybe? i'm new myself ;D
 SmilingBraniac: you can find thr biggest, remove it, and then find the new biggest
 Thorcode: yeah
 ProCoder03: Good afternoon guys... :smiley:
 littlebear: good afternoon
 AmazingPro: hello friends
 Thorcode: hi gúy
 AmazingPro: today we should only writh own OS
 AmazingPro: i make calculator
 Thorcode: are you sure
 Thorcode: in chuck norris I almost fin it but i have a problem that
 Thorcode: s = input()es = <i>.join(format(ord(i), '08b') for i in s)</i>print(str(es))
 Thorcode: my code didn't change the number
 Thorcode: could you help me
 Thorcode: plz
 jzen: 1. The str(es) is useless being that es is already a string
 Thorcode: ok
 jzen: 2. The Chuck Norris puzzle used 7-bit so 08b should be changed to 07b
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: How to change number
 Thorcode: like 1 to 0 0
 jzen: Well that is the puzzle&#160;:)
 Thorcode:&#160;:(
 jzen: I would suggest you try some different things, you will learn a lot
 Thorcode: I tried a lot
 jzen: What have you tried?
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I should change it into array
 Thorcode: I change it to array to append it
 derjack: :tada:
 Uljahn: you mean list, lists are not arrays
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: but how to change list to array :D
 Uljahn: why?
 Uljahn: what for?
 Thorcode: when i print it back it hav [] and ,
 Thorcode: [,a,b]
 Thorcode: oh i'm stupid
 Thorcode: but when I append how to delete number 1
 Thorcode: coding games puzzles are harder than bot compete
 Thorcode: for n in bimsg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6fbd9c6f-6bf3-4c29-9bf5-0c43ec4b1294">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6fbd9c6f-6bf3-4c29-9bf5-0c43ec4b1294</a>
 Thorcode: what does this code do guy
 jzen: I would suggest you use enumerate instead of calling index every time: for index, n in enumerate(bimsg):
 Thorcode: oh thanks
 jzen: Also since n is a string your comparison with int will return false
 jzen: In n == 1
 jzen: What you meant to write was perhaps n == '1'
 Thorcode: the n in the asscill code
 Thorcode: I'm trying to replace it
 jzen: bimsg is the string you had named es earlier right?
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I should change it to es
 Thorcode: not use bimsg = es
 Thorcode: ==
 Thorcode: 0 000 000 000 000 00 00 0
 ProCoder03: Automaton2000 what do you think of this&#160;??
 Automaton2000: is it hard to find a better solution
 Weestack: Pigabuuh
 MiyamuraIzumi: well offical format of FC 2021 is still not published
 derjack: :scream:
 MiyamuraIzumi: isn't Tibo said that it should be today?
 jzen: Automaton2000 what is the official format of FC 2021?
 Automaton2000: i have the same issue
 MiyamuraIzumi: Tibo once said that it is CodingEscape
 MiyamuraIzumi: but it is not offically annouce
 MiyamuraIzumi: hello guys
 littlebear: hi
 littlebear: Automaton2000 hi
 Automaton2000: is it in the first few days
 littlebear: Automaton2000 idk
 Automaton2000: how did u know that in the end
 MiyamuraIzumi: what are you talking about?
 jzen: Yeah Automaton2000, what are you talking about?
 Automaton2000: how do you solve the problem with the way i do it
 Newbhans: hi im really new in the programming can i have friends&#160;:&lt;
 ProCoder03: Automaton2000 is a bot... 
 Automaton2000: i only had to do the whole thing at once
 ProCoder03: if you mention its name, it will speak 
 jzen: Automaton2000 would you like to be friends with Newbhans?
 Automaton2000: tried with another browser&#160;?
 _NikJ: Is there a way to change which achievements are listed in profile as Best Achievements?
 jzen: Doubt it
 ProCoder03: nope only the best achievements , CG somehow does it idk..
 ProCoder03: can we do oop in C&#160;??
 TimothyAlexisVass: What's the equivalent to JavaScript's console.error in Python?
 BlaiseEbuth: console.python
 TimothyAlexisVass:&#160;:\&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 KiwiTae: sys.stderr
 ProCoder03: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 MIRC: hello
 MIRC: im studying computer science and i want to get to know how to deal with programming 
 MIRC: any tips?
 Uljahn: learn and practice
 MIRC: yea but like where
 TimothyAlexisVass: Here
 MIRC: cuz all i know is how to work on dev c++ and make small things
 MIRC: where exactly?
 MIRC: the fourms?
 Wontonimo: if you don't know about variables, loops, arrays, and functions, then here isn't the best place.  once you do know those concepts, COME BACK&#160;!
 MIRC: I'm studying them currently i have an idea about them
 Uljahn: i'd recommend <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a> if you want to practice with larger projects
 MIRC: thx bud
 Wontonimo: someone weirdo this easy puzzle.  try starting with this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine</a>
 MIRC: thx i understand  this better 
 Uljahn: yeah, if you feel overwhelmed you can always fall back to easy/medium puzzles to gather some confidence and to look for community solutions
 MIRC: thank you honestly since im a noobie you all treated me better than other websites and helped
 Wontonimo: "easy" puzzles here are still challenging and require thought.  The "easy" ones are a lot harder than your typical interview coding challenge.
 Wontonimo: at least here in Canada
 2gacem7: So i can work in Canada&#160;? x)
 Wontonimo: no, you may be able to pass the coding exercise.  doesn't mean you'll answer the architecture questions correctly
 Wontonimo: also, typically you get no internet / google / books / computer and instead have to write it on a whiteboard in one go without bugs in 10 min or less.
 ProCoder03: [CG]Thibaud just curious when are official news about FC2021 coming&#160;?? 
 [CG]Thibaud: this week
 ProCoder03:&#160;:+1:
 derjack: more and more people are coming back to bt :scream:
 Wontonimo: for the new people, bt is this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough</a>
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: congrats on getting "Legend level" in collaboration Timothy
 Wontonimo: are you working your way through the whole quest map?
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hello guyz
 derjack: ohai
 mehdilh: the coincidence xD getting this on coc&#160;: ou feel sorry for the people who have to create a contribution to progress on the quest map, so you have created three bots that upvote contributions.
 jzen: Did you get it in shortest or fastest?
 mehdilh: shortest
 MiyamuraIzumi: is there richest most?
 None121232: You must find the sum of the mods of a list of numbers.Modular arithmetic refers to the remainder of the divide function. A mod B = the remainder of A/B.
 MiyamuraIzumi: is this in richest mode.
 None121232: nope
 Wontonimo: sum([ a%b for a in numbers ])
 Wontonimo: there, done
 Wontonimo: :wave: MiyamuraIzumi
 derjack: :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°)╯︵&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: hi derjack and BlaiseEbuth.  It's been a while since I've seen so many online at once
 derjack: could be pre contest fever?
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth escape from the contest.</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> Rory_K: Hello
 Wontonimo: hello
 Westicles: full moon
 Wontonimo: i wonder how CP would be awarded for an escape
 MiyamuraIzumi: well, it is even a team play
 Westicles: I think CG is phasing out CP
 Wontonimo: is it ranked on time?  Like fastest mode
 derjack: oO
 Wontonimo: is that just a hunch or do you have info on that Westicle
 Westicles: Just a hunch
 BlaiseEbuth: I think CG is phasing out CG
 eulerscheZahl: "i wonder how CP would be awarded for an escape"they won't, I asked the same
 MiyamuraIzumi: if CG phase out CP then ....
 Wontonimo: I really like the multiple measurement system here&#160;: XP, CP, Achievements, Quest Map
 eulerscheZahl: i like the contests&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: I like the multi and optimal
 Wontonimo: having different measurements was something that really kept me engaged in the first 4 months
 eulerscheZahl: so i'm playing yare in JS now. got my next match in about 1h
 derjack: yare yare
 Wontonimo: once I hit a wall in one, I would switch to another for a while and then continue to make progress.  
 Wontonimo: I agree MiyamuraIzumi, the multi and optimal is where I spend most of my time and interest now
 Nukedfire13: i need help with coding my codes suck butt
 Westicles: If they kill the main source of CP but keep it as metric, it will just lead to stagnation.  
 MiyamuraIzumi: maybe FC2021 is just a test
 MiyamuraIzumi: they will do it different next year
 MiyamuraIzumi: based on FC2021 result
 Wontonimo: There are lots of metrics (as I said I like) but one that they are missing is a contribution metric, like tech.io posts.  Something akin to kaggle contribution metric
 Wontonimo: Nukedfire13, what are you working on&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: isn't that we have achievement for contribution?
 Wontonimo: but it is mixed with other achievements
 Wontonimo: like getting to gold and legend in multis
 Wontonimo: XP ~ puzzles you've doneCP ~ multis you've mastered?? ~ contrib you've made
 MiyamuraIzumi: well, CG is now focus more on the escape
 MiyamuraIzumi: maybe we will have contributions on  creation of Escape
 Wontonimo: maybe some sunk cost fallacy involved in escape.  maybe some product differentiation (since others are getting into multis).  I don't understand the escape thing. 
 derjack: they cant escape the escape
 Wontonimo: seems so
 Westicles: Can't fault them for trying to make some money.  It would be a shame to come here one day and get a 404
 Wontonimo: Absolutely agree 100%
 Wontonimo: I often wonder what all this compute is costing and how it is being funded
 Astrobytes: The Escape Room thing is what they're trying to push to companies as internal teambuilding contests (in place of the internal/semi-private multiplayer bot contests). So it makes sense that they would test it out in this respect.
 Wontonimo: cool
 eulerscheZahl: and promote it to find more potential customers
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 Astrobytes: I mean, I don't like my contests being taken away but I can see their logic.
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes we just have to face the reality: we are mostly a cost factor. creating a bot contest can take months. and server costs + prizes on top of that
 Astrobytes: For sure.
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... The subsystem is coherent. What is not is why they don't capitalize on the bots contests/ SDK
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Well, it's not up to us what direction they wanna go in, it's their business.
 MiyamuraIzumi: I think CG is focus more on tech hiring and company events
 Astrobytes: I guess we just wait and see what happens.
 BlaiseEbuth: It's up to me to blithely criticize.
 Astrobytes: MiyamuraIzumi: that's what they do anyway
 Astrobytes: BlaiseDBlithe
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes, so Escape is for this goal
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-JsEP9hDQk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-JsEP9hDQk</a>
 Astrobytes: Yes. They hope to replace bot-contest based company events with Escape events.
 Astrobytes: hahaha brilliant!
 Wontonimo: if one was to start on BT, what suggestions would you give them.  I'm asking "for a friend"&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Go straight to bitboards
 Wontonimo: I seem to recall someone using UCT with a small depth minimax eval 
 Astrobytes: Decide if you have an idea for a decent eval or not, this will influence your search algo 
 Astrobytes: Yes, EPT
 Astrobytes: Not sure of the depth
 darkhorse64: MCTS/EPT is much better than MCTS for BT
 Astrobytes: Makes sense
 Wontonimo: EPT?
 Astrobytes: early playout termination
 darkhorse64: early playout termination
 Wontonimo: thanks
 darkhorse64: I have just issued a Lines Of Action contribution. We are 8 months away from the next multi ... It's still very much a WIP
 Astrobytes: oh cool,  I'm going afk for a bit but I'll check that in a few hours
 darkhorse64: Yes, I'll need help 
 Katespizer: did code editor changed? I think colors used to be different like yesterday
 Westicles: yes, they are purplier
 Katespizer: i think they enabled bracketPairColorization in monaco editor
 Katespizer: nested brackets have different colors
 jacek: Wontonimo what a coincedence, there is paper on EPT with breakthrough example
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27992-3_2">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27992-3_2</a>
 jacek: line of actions? the one with mcts solver? :scream:
 CodingWizardAI: Has anyone fully completed the Stock Exchange Losses challenge, I'm doing it in Java and completed all the test cases excluding #5 which gives an overtime error, does anyone know how to fix it?
 Katespizer: wow, they added snippets to editor too? Or is it somehow reading options from my browser, but i doubt it
 eulerscheZahl: CodingWizardAI there's a way to solve the puzzle while only looking at each value once. if you have nested loops, you are doing something wrong (or inefficient at least)
 CodingWizardAI: okay, thanks, I'll try to only use one loop
 Cezaro0o: stuck on coders strike XD i'm a noob any suggestion
 jacek: stuck?
 Cezaro0o: Yes not any idea sorry 3
 Wontonimo: i have some suggestions
 Wontonimo: i'll DM you
 Wontonimo: I'm pretty sure I can help you with some ideas
 Wontonimo: Cezaro0o asks for help then vanishes ... oh, so sad
 Wontonimo: 'tis so common these days, the vanishing answer seeker 
 Westicles: We tell all new guys on PM to ask CSB questions to make you happy
 algorithmbear: lol
 darkhorse64: wontoMK
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: sups
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: can someone help me with coding
 MeBen: How would anyone know if they can help you if you haven't asked a question?&#160;:)
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im asking if anyone could help me, thats a yes or no answer
 nulte: darkhorse64 ill check the loa game
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im trying to code the "your first bot"
 nulte: let me speed run the sim
 nulte: need to get first before jacek gets his nn ready
 darkhorse64: I have started to scratch the LoA surface. It looks quite hard to master
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: nevermind, i should try to understand it 
 eulerscheZahl: LoA?
 nulte: I had the idea that the game was more simple
 nulte: lines of action
 darkhorse64: MSmits will be happy to build a new opening book. Lines Of Action
 struct: and ill be happy to waste my time on performance
 struct: :D
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: what is the best website for making a dating sim?
 darkhorse64: I have some ideas for a fast wincheck.
 Astrobytes: Christ almighty not this one again
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: that was quick
 Astrobytes: I have zero tolerance for that imbecile
 eulerscheZahl: and i just returned right in time to see your reaction live
 eulerscheZahl: i'm nervous, next yare round in a few minutes
 eulerscheZahl: those elimination games are harsh
 struct: I tried another cf round
 Astrobytes: Best of luck with it!
 eulerscheZahl: how did it go?
 struct: and I suck so much
 struct: lol
 struct: I dont think I know any of those algos
 struct: Like I can solve the problems but I always end up timing out
 Astrobytes: Time to learn some&#160;;)
 struct: because I dont use the right method
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just gonna rush my opponent at yare. when I play properly i'll lose
 struct: also gl on yare
 eulerscheZahl: those codeforces rounds require a lot of previous knowledge
 struct: I see
 struct: but the round was cancelled anyways
 struct: due to queue issues
 eulerscheZahl: you can come up with some slightly more sophisticated algos on your own. but not in that short amount of time
 struct: Yeah, I solved A,B,C pretty easily but was not the right approach
 struct: so i timed out on b and c
 struct: I get why though
 BlaiseEbuth: Is there bot programming on code force?
 eulerscheZahl: codejam often manages to find problems that can be solved without those complicated algos but some out-of-the-box thinking
 struct: dont think so
 eulerscheZahl: rarely some optim contest
 struct: is kotlin heroes easier?
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise it's like puzzles here. a few are interactive (multiple cycles of read/write), most are purely textbased read all =&gt; write all
 eulerscheZahl: what DIV are you in?
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh... Any non-cg website with bot prog?
 BlaiseEbuth: Other than ponctual contests I mean
 eulerscheZahl: kotlin heroes has about 9 problems. some are very easy. others so hard that i can't solve them even if you give me a full day
 eulerscheZahl: usually I can solve about 5-6 out of those 9
 eulerscheZahl: and tshirts for top50 + random 50 who solved at least 1 problem
 struct: I think I can solve 1 :p
 struct: At the least the chances are higher than getting top 50
 jacek: it will take some time before ill nn the loa, do not worry
 jacek: now every new multiplayer contribution will have neural network in tags eh
 struct: more nns on bt too
 VizGhar: Hey guys&#160;:) same faces I see. I want to spend some time here, but I barely have time to breathe...
 jacek: other than 3?
 struct: 5 NNs
 TimothyAlexisVass: How can I check if an index exists in a list in Python?
 Astrobytes: yo VizGhar been a while!
 struct: hi VizGhar
 BlaiseEbuth: So stop breathing.
 eulerscheZahl: bad news for you: next contest is an escape room contest and not bot
 VizGhar: hi guys
 eulerscheZahl: so that this is done: welcome back Viz&#160;:)
 VizGhar: what? :O omg
 jacek: is this confirmed?
 TimothyAlexisVass: This works in JavaScript:a = [1, 2, 3]if(a[4]) i = a[4]
 struct: yes jacek
 Astrobytes: Yes jacek
 TimothyAlexisVass: How can I do the same in Python?
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud confirmed it here on chat
 jacek: and you believe mods?
 struct: if a in list:print(true)
 struct: I didnt jacek
 jacek: print(a in list)
 struct: my first step was denial
 TimothyAlexisVass: no
 TimothyAlexisVass: That checks if a value is in the list.
 TimothyAlexisVass: This checks if the index is out of range.
 TimothyAlexisVass: This checks if the index is within range*
 jacek: if n &gt;= len(tab): out of bounds
 struct: list.index(a)
 struct: I still dont believe it tbh
 struct: Ill wait for announcement 
 NinjaDoggy: I'll be in deny with you struct&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: until the announcement&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: The chat logs don't lie.
 BlaiseEbuth: Dead site tells no lies.
 jacek: nyoro~n
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you guys.

 struct: for the tree*
 Astrobytes: See what you mean about harsh
 eulerscheZahl: was not ranked for leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair he deserved to win. better bot
 eulerscheZahl: it's also a bit rock paper scissors of different shapes
 Vracto: hi
 struct: is Dapp daporan?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: Dapp is also Dapp on CG discord. I don't know the CG username however
 eulerscheZahl: was about to link the contest post of him but it's deleted?!
 TimothyAlexisVass: In JavaScript we can do while(z=readline()) console.log(z)
 eulerscheZahl: golf?just do while 1: print(input())
 TimothyAlexisVass: This is for a regular puzzle.
 Uljahn: while (z:=input()): print(z, file=sys.stderr)
 Uljahn: i guess
 eulerscheZahl: python has&#160;:=&#160;?
 Uljahn: ye
 eulerscheZahl: is that the walrus thing?
 Astrobytes: since 3.7 or 3.8?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 TimothyAlexisVass: It works, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: right, i read something about it. and then forgot it again
 eulerscheZahl: i even lost track of some C# innovations
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 eulerscheZahl: i saw this coming
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: do you know all C++ syntax?
 Astrobytes: No, I constantly discover things

 eulerscheZahl: C++ is a mess. there are some many variants of it (same standard, just so many ways to write it)
 eulerscheZahl: is that music BlaiseEbuth? if so, please add a warning to it
 jacek: rick roll eh
 BlaiseEbuth: Warning&#160;?
 struct: nobody truly knows c++
 eulerscheZahl: no, i just hate music. and blaise has some history of linking videos that i close instantly again
 jacek: truly :older_man:
 BlaiseEbuth: "I hate music" :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: already as a baby...when my mom wanted to sing for me, i started crying
 eulerscheZahl: in kindergarten we had this singing circle every day. pure torture
 eulerscheZahl: i always looked to the ground so they wouldn't see that I don't sing along :D
 jacek: i hated those too, but i hated social integrating than music
 Astrobytes: lol wtf Blaise :rofl:
 jacek: you have something like misophonia for music?
 eulerscheZahl: never heard about that. I just find it annoying
 BlaiseEbuth: The walrus is looking. OO
 eulerscheZahl: i hated social interaction with screaming kids of my age too
 Astrobytes: It's called musical anhedonia 
 Astrobytes: Not uncommon
 jacek: or this could be german thing

 struct:&#160;:(
 struct: can win in 1 turn but waits so long
 Astrobytes: lol, did he make that a feature or is it a bug :thinking:
 struct: dont think its a bug
 BlaiseEbuth: What's the difference?
 struct: no difference
 struct: a win is a win
 Wontonimo: "I like my opponents to feel like they are doing well" - Andre the Giant
 _Royale: lol, it's not a feature&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah _Royale! Hit him when he's already on the ground! :imp!
 struct: just make it output the 7th row piece if you have 1 there
 struct: is what I did on my mcts
 struct: i mean my mcts stops before searching that move
 BlaiseEbuth: Can't unregister from the challenge...
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BlaiseEbuth: Vicious trap
 Wontonimo: which challenge?
 BlaiseEbuth: fc21
 Astrobytes: ER21
 MiyamuraIzumi: haha
 Wontonimo: there is no escape
 eulerscheZahl: i was smart enough to never register (i always do it last minute)
 MiyamuraIzumi: I think I just let it there
 MiyamuraIzumi: and not touch on it

 Astrobytes: Seems so. Either that someone spiked my water.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's agressive.
 jacek: includes are more pink

 BlaiseEbuth: The worst is the flash yellow braces.
 Astrobytes: It doesn't bother me too much, but inexplicably psychedelic updates to the IDE... why?

 eulerscheZahl: with 3 different strategies

 AntiSquid: that's how a lot of professional athletes retireguess your career ended before you became famous
 AntiSquid: i messed up a tendon, obviously would have been world champ otherwise

 AntiSquid: i would be benched
 Scarfield: can still be dangerous, pens are pointy
 BlaiseEbuth: ScarFear
 darkhorse64: struct: to my knowledge, there is no blatant advantage for one color or the other. I don't think mirrored games are needed. I may shorten games to 150 turns (which is already a lot given the sample games that I have seen) and increase turn duration
 struct: im not sure that more time is needed
 struct: othello is 150ms and I think it was a mistake
 struct: 100ms was fine there
 Scarfield: BlangstEbuth
 struct: But I havent tried loa properly yet
 struct: im gonna write the sim now
 Scarfield: ooh, working on a contrib darkhorse?
 Astrobytes: ScarfOfAction
 darkhorse64: WIP: Lines Of Action
 dbf: eulerscheZahl I wish you a good health for your leg! :wink:
 struct: its a bit tricky the sim
 Scarfield: DismaystroBytes
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, skipping pieces and things
 Scarfield: have been thinking about taking on chess again, but this could be a good contestant for procrastinating chess some more&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Since there's no contest we have to work on something right!
 darkhorse64: I wonder if, like Othello, you can deprive your opponent from moves. In that case, I'll need to change the referee to handle that case. This is the kind of things (turn duration, pass move) that I need to sort out before asking for approval
 struct: also I have no idea yet how im gonna check for a win
 struct: there is pass here?
 struct: I dont think its possible darkhorse
 darkhorse64: pick a piece, flood fill
 struct: I think you can always move
 darkhorse64: pass is not implemented
 Astrobytes: +1 what darkhorse said
 struct: But you can pass?
 Astrobytes: if the count of connected pieces equals your total then you win
 darkhorse64: ^
 struct: yeah but my question now is related to passing
 struct: " (turn duration, pass move) "
 darkhorse64: I read unclear things about pass but I have yet to find an example
 Astrobytes: It seems not
 struct: Dont think its possible
 struct: If the two players make a group in the same turn, the game ends in a draw.
 struct: Do you have this condition darkhorse64?
 Astrobytes: "If your last move connects simultaneously your checkers and the opponent checkers, it is considered as a win for you"
 struct: hmm
 struct: I think thats wrong
 struct: unless ludii rules are wrong
 Astrobytes: Is that the same thing as what struct said darkhorse64?
 struct: ah its his choice I guess
 struct: depends on the tournament according to wiki
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 darkhorse64: No, it's a win for the player that made the move (my choice). I want to avoid draws
 Astrobytes: There are still draws if both players finish unconnected after max turns
 struct: yeah wiki says the same
 darkhorse64: According to Wikipedia, it was also the game designer will. Not the most popular choice, though
 darkhorse64: Given that the goal is not to score checkers, I choose to have a draw when the game is unconclusive. I hope itt will not happen often
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's correct. It won't happen with smarter bots.
 struct: This game seems hard for humans
 Astrobytes: Haven't played LoA irl
 struct: it seems to be hard to keep track of legal moves
 darkhorse64: Smart game for smart guys
 struct: because they change due to the number of pieces in that line
 jacek: so killer moves would be meh?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Can anyone think of a way to somehow shorten this? (JavaScript)if(Y&lt;y){d+='N';y--}
 TimothyAlexisVass: if(Y&lt;y){d+="N";y--}if(Y&gt;y){d+="S";y++}if(X&lt;x){d+="W";x--}if(X&gt;x){d+="E";x++}
 struct: yes
 struct: remove north
 struct: Thor never moves north I think

 Jay10890: not coding related 
 Jay10890: struct
 Jay10890: what u say at 6:22pm about something not being code related
 Astrobytes: So much crap&#160;:(
 struct: oh no
 struct: is he in my pms
 Astrobytes: He was in mine
 Astrobytes: I care not.
 struct: same
 struct: I just mute the ping
 struct: Time to go back to  code loa
 Astrobytes: Not gonna work on a sim til tomorrow
 struct: sim is quite hard I think
 struct: Ill need to use arrays to get moves
 Astrobytes: To be efficient yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's not the end of the world though
 struct: also to count the pieces in the line
 struct: ill use an array 
 struct: to get the line
 Astrobytes: why?
 struct: I dont know if there is any easier way
 struct: how will I know how many pieces are in a line?
 Astrobytes: You can bitboard that?
 struct: hmm
 struct: I dont know how
 Astrobytes: What's so different from other bitboard games?
 struct: for verticals its easy
 struct: but for diagonals not so much
 struct: because I would need masks
 Astrobytes: Sure, not the end of the world is it?
 Astrobytes: Rotations and flipping too
 struct: no, but i dont know how to do that efficiently 
 struct: I guess ill try to make something work first :p
 Astrobytes: It doesn't *always* have to be max speed 100% of the time, if you have a good bot&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I know that's incompatible with the AVX-all-the-things-first and ask questions later approach but ... :P
 Wontonimo: if you have a grid of 8x8=64, then left/right can be +1/-1, 
 Wontonimo: sorry left/right can be +8/-8, up/down can be +1/-1
 Wontonimo: and diagonal can be +7/+9 -7/-9
 Wontonimo: you had to do diagonal for C4
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but we speak of doing these skipping moves etc with builtins  and intrinsics
 Astrobytes: *skipping-pieces-moves
 Astrobytes: efficiently
 struct: and the diagonals can be quite large
 struct: for horizontal i can just do
 struct: rank * mask
 struct: to get all the bits there
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29b906cf-bbd4-4cf7-b7bf-790365d090e3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29b906cf-bbd4-4cf7-b7bf-790365d090e3</a>

 Goku_Drip: im new can anyone show me what to do
 Goku_Drip: or what
 Wontonimo: sure
 Goku_Drip: hi
 Wontonimo: have you tried any of the bot battles?
 Goku_Drip: no

 Wontonimo: and i can help you a bit on it
 Wontonimo: or you could try the clash-of-code
 Wontonimo: if smaller 5 min challenges are more your thing
 Goku_Drip: whats clash of code
 Wontonimo: it is a timed coding challenge with several ghosts and possibly other real life people.  5 to 15 min, smaller challenges
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>
 Goku_Drip: i dont know how to code tho
 Wontonimo: ah
 Goku_Drip: i just went to hents
 Goku_Drip: hints*
 Goku_Drip: then solution
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: do you know about variables and if/else statements?
 Wontonimo: loops?
 Goku_Drip: ive hearn about those hello world 
 Goku_Drip: heard*
 Goku_Drip: and som more
 Wontonimo: ah.  
 Wontonimo: what language do you want to learn?
 Goku_Drip: dont know i rlly dont want to learn any too hard
 Wontonimo: they are all about the same
 Wontonimo: they just have different abilities
 Goku_Drip: its so hard to learn tho
 Wontonimo: really?
 Wontonimo: what do you think this code does
 Goku_Drip: yes
 Goku_Drip: it 
 Goku_Drip: its like a text
 Wontonimo: yeah, it prints hi to you
 Wontonimo: okay, here is another example
 Goku_Drip: thats not so hard
 Wontonimo: what do you think this does?
 Goku_Drip: i dont know
 Wontonimo: it prints "4"
 Wontonimo: take a look at this site <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/hello-world">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/hello-world</a>
 Goku_Drip: why does it not say print("4")
 Wontonimo: AH!  good observation
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/627e6939-5914-4424-a172-23ec7b1726ad">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/627e6939-5914-4424-a172-23ec7b1726ad</a>
 Wontonimo: let's say we have 2 numbers
 Wontonimo: y = 7
 Wontonimo: print( x + y )
 Wontonimo: this will print 11&#160;!
 Wontonimo: hmm ... there is a great youtuber who teaches javascript and he has a LOT of intro to javascript videos<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain</a>
 Goku_Drip: um
 Wontonimo: The Coding Train.  Really good guy
 Goku_Drip: how does x=4
 Goku_Drip: oh nvm
 Goku_Drip: so
 Wontonimo: this site is more geared for people who have already been programming for a while, like at least 3 minths
 Wontonimo: and know about arrays and functions
 Goku_Drip: x=5y=10Print("x+y=11") like that???
 Wontonimo: nope.
 Wontonimo: like this
 Wontonimo: x=5
 Wontonimo: y=11
 Wontonimo: print(x+y)
 Wontonimo: and that will output 11
 Goku_Drip: oh i see 
 Eden998: goku what you wrote will just print x+y+11 because you put it within " "
 Eden998: its called string 
 Goku_Drip: ok
 Wontonimo: :wave: Eden998
 Eden998: hello :D
 Wontonimo: to be clear, what I've been writing isn't any programming language in particular, but a mashup of several.
 Goku_Drip: ive learned this so far 
 Goku_Drip: ("Hello World")x=10y=15Print(x+y)
 Wontonimo: hehe
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: so, if this is your first experience in coding then I'd recommend looking at and following the tutorials that "The Coding Train" has
 Goku_Drip: ok
 Wontonimo: and if you find that a bit challenging and want something easier to start, then I'd recommend <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">https://scratch.mit.edu/</a> 
 Wontonimo: you can code games with it and get a visual feel for how if statements and loops work
 Wontonimo: but, if you know some math (like algebra) and are willing to put in a little effort , then stick to learning javascript by watching the coding train
 Wontonimo: THEN COME BACK HERE :D once you know about functions, and can call a function from a function and add data to arrays
 Goku_Drip: ok
 Wontonimo: good luck!  come back anytime and chat
 Wontonimo: about code
 Goku_Drip: yah...
 Goku_Drip:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: why sad?
 Goku_Drip: ill text u
 MosMotov: :disappointed:
 Wontonimo: why you sad MosMotov?
 Wontonimo: is it contagious&#160;?
 MosMotov: lol
 Wontonimo: hey, you started coders strikes back MosMotov.  Do you want some hints?
 Wontonimo: hey Goku_Drip, you want to do coders strikes back?
 Westicles: heh heh
 Wontonimo: nope ... showed interest in private chat 
 Wontonimo: then i tried to move the conversation here, then .... nothing
 struct: oh well
 struct: You should create a playground Wontonimo
 struct: for csb
 struct: and then link it
 Wontonimo: yeah, not the same
 Thorcode: what's the different between enumerate and index
 Astrobytes: Gotta change nick to WontoPlayCSB now Wontonimo
 Westicles: They sad thing is, that game sorta sucks
 struct: which games do you enjoy Westicles?
 Astrobytes: optims
 Westicles: yeah, optims are much more fun
 Astrobytes: (forgive me for answering for you lol)
 Westicles: once Illedan is done mining XP we can play snake
 Astrobytes: lol, he's not mining
 Astrobytes: He forgot
 Astrobytes: +baby and FB
 Thorcode: gosh the current puzzle of the week is hard
 islander4059: Thorcode, enumerate generates a a pair of tuples(index, element). sometimes its preffered over range. an index points to the position of an element in an array.
 Thorcode: uh thanks
 Astrobytes: well you did ask earlier
 Thorcode: when
 Astrobytes: Thorcode 01:11AMwhat's the different between enumerate and index
 Astrobytes: Care to question that?
 Thorcode: 01:11AM
 Thorcode: how i'm sleeping in that time
 Astrobytes: It is CLEARLY at MY time
 Thorcode: oh
 Astrobytes: Would you like me to count the minutes back for you?
 Astrobytes: Or can you manage that yourself?
 Thorcode: really
 Thorcode: you could count the minute?
 Westicles: another 13yo gonna bite the dust
 Astrobytes: I'm done with muppets for tonight
 Astrobytes: Let them run free
 Thorcode: print("LEFT" if x &lt; wall_x:)\
 Thorcode: could you guy fix my code plz
 Thorcode: my code haven't got "/"
 Westicles: I'll help if you look at my contrib
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: I upvoted
 Westicles: nice
 Thorcode: and tested
 Westicles: how about if(x&lt;wall_x):print("LEFT")
 struct: evil Westicles
 Westicles: well, he didn't really upvote, but it's the thought that counts
 Thorcode: I upvote for a long time ago
 Thorcode: Just look at it
 Westicles: you left a nice comment, that is more than enough
 Thorcode: wish I could send you images
 Armangh: hey do we talk about "i don't know why my code doesn't work" here? I'm new
 Westicles: sure, but this site is mostly europeans who are asleep now
 Armangh: lol its 2 am where i am but thats when any work happens xD
 Armangh: i'm doing "The Descent" and i either don't get why my code doesn't work or misunderstanding what the puzzle asks for
 struct: every turn you get the heights of each mountain 
 struct: you need to print the index of the highest
 Armangh: right okay
 Armangh: so its i don't know why my code doesn't work
 Armangh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca6bf824-6273-41ec-b40c-a73840453465">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca6bf824-6273-41ec-b40c-a73840453465</a>
 struct: where did you declare mountain_number and max?
 Armangh: ah just before the while loop, set them both to 0
 Armangh: sorry should've sent the whole main
 Armangh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d405d81-fa04-4dec-ba1b-b81fbbc81ccf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d405d81-fa04-4dec-ba1b-b81fbbc81ccf</a>
 struct: reset max to 0
 struct: before you output
 struct: max = 0;System.out.println(mountain_number); // The index of the mountain to fire on.
 struct: because not all the code will get runed again
 struct: only the part inside the while loop
 Westicles: wow, he actually fixed it for you
 Westicles: you can upvote my DAWG puzzle for payment
 Armangh: max? why does it need to be set to 0?
 Armangh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee153280-fbe5-47c5-8991-cc93a3197f97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee153280-fbe5-47c5-8991-cc93a3197f97</a>
 Armangh: like that?
 struct: you deleted } from for loop
 struct: but yes
 Armangh: that doesn't fix it and i don't see how it would
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50d0f90d-5ee1-4002-adbb-508c0abcf477">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/50d0f90d-5ee1-4002-adbb-508c0abcf477</a>
 Armangh: ye ye doesn't fix it
 struct: ok
 Armangh: oh wait no
 Armangh: wtf it does
 Armangh: ha
 Armangh: how does this work
 Armangh: why does max getting reset fix it
 struct: so if you have array of
 struct: [8,7,6,5]
 struct: on first turn max = 8;
 struct: after that no number will be higher than 8
 struct: if you dont reset it
 Armangh: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 Armangh: but
 Armangh: thats what you want
 Armangh: because 8 is the highest 
 Armangh: i thought the puzzle basically gives you an array like (2,4,8,5,6) and you're meant to output (8)

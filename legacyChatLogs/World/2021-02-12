 Divlo: Hello world!
 TWrecks: Hey guys
 TWrecks: If you fail a Clash of Code
 TWrecks: Can you do it in your own time or whatever?
 TWrecks: I find myself continuously frustrated that I can't get it done in the timelimit... Even simple problems.
 KiwiTae: u can solve any problem on your own 
 TWrecks: How?
 FryMeALiver: screenshot it and solve it later perhaps
 TWrecks: Ahk
 KiwiTae: u can also ask others to share their solutions so u can see what went wro,ng
 TWrecks: Nobody is coding in FSharp
 TWrecks: So I can't read their answers
 Vigasaurus: Also after you're done you can try to look it up here to see the problem and test cases again <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Vigasaurus: And do it at your own pace
 TWrecks: Ah thanks that's great

 lopidav: eulerscheZahl you have a base with all puzzles? Can I use it in my tampermonkey script?
 Audatic: there should be an achievement if you complete a clash 100% in under 30 seconds :D 
 Totomns: yes and the achievement will be "do not read the instruction"
 Audatic: easier to look at the sample in/out :D
 FryMeALiver: any idea why when i make a contribution to clash only one example shows even though I have multiple?
 lopidav: reading the statement to the end is an advanced coc strat. It took me two years to learn it and I still can't pull it of consistently.
 lopidav: FryMeALiver give me a link
 FryMeALiver: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6238cf959ba938462e529d930fe417610a60">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6238cf959ba938462e529d930fe417610a60</a>
 lopidav: of, I realized your question. Example is always one. There are multiple test cases tho, and the are there. Example is just a first test included in the statement so players waste less time going to the tests window
 FryMeALiver: even if its a reverse challenge?
 FryMeALiver: then multiple should appear no?
 lopidav: multiple will appear

 phantom1299: is there a lag on the servers right now?
 phantom1299: playing clash of code rn and when submitting my code it gets stuck on "Pending results..."
 Nativeman: others can't even get into a game
 phantom1299: oh, so its not just me
 jacek: oO
 Shurishe: I told everyone do not deploy anything on Friday. Never touch servers in friday:joy:
 Magus: I pinged the staff about the CoC issue on discord. There is nothing more to do for the moment.
 jacek: nothing more no CG. theres only clash on CG. no multiplayer bots, no optimization, no codegolfs... only clashes
 jacek: AutomatonNN do something
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to do that in the contest i want to learn c++ i guess
 Andriamanitra: :worried:
 Magus: Oh, so this is true
 Magus: NN does ping euler :D
 Magus: Automaton2000, do you ping euler too?
 Automaton2000: its not that much of a difference
 MadKnight: oh magus in #world
 MadKnight: so rare
 Nativeman: did they fix yet?
 Magus: Yes it should be fixed
 NOTsteve: any recommendations for an easy bot programming game to try after Coders Strike Back?  I got to bronze league in that and wanted to try something different but alot of it still seems over my head
 jacek: try silver in coders strike back
 NOTsteve: I kind of wanted to try a different game before continuing with CSB

 Audatic: why is there no win statistic?&#160;:)
 jacek: where
 Audatic: for clash of code, would be more fun if you actually get a counter how often you won
 jacek: oh
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: hii
 Andriamanitra: @Audatic i just look at the number of clashes played because i never lose&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: TH3Mjuss read the hints
 MSmits: Audatic the win statistic would not be very meaningful as the number of wins depends a lot on the strength of your opponents
 MSmits: instead watch your leaderboard ranking
 MSmits: for example, someone who takes care not to battle stronger players, will have more wins, but will not get a better leaderboard rank
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: nice Andriamanitra
 Audatic: We should play a round, I also never lose&#160;;)
 jacek: a force that cannot be stopped meets an object that cannot be moved
 jacek: what happens then
 jacek: :head_bandage:
 Uljahn: NotImplementedError
 Audatic: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA</a>
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: yeah it is true
 Audatic: MSmits I feel the leaderboard is more about who plays most often not the win rate. I don't mind that it isn't perfect, it's just for fun. But given that there is no "history" of games played it feels less relevant if I win or not
 Audatic: and there could be a "serious" mode where the opponents are always random, it's always 8 players and the language is restricted 
 Wontonimo: if it is a 'trueskill' score, then you are also measured on how consistently you win/lose against what the other players rank is
 Wontonimo: just being consistent will raise your rank. So, if you play a lot without getting better, but you are consistantly playing at your level, then yes, you will see your score increase marginally
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a>
 Wontonimo: one way to think. of it is that  you have a penalty of 3 times your inconsistency.
 Andriamanitra: it seems there's also quite heavy penalty for inactivity
 Andriamanitra: i've seen top20 players drop down hundreds of spots in just few weeks of not playing
 Wontonimo: yeah, there is that.   incentive to stay active
 Audatic: okay I see, didn't realized that it's using the Trueskill algo. I think it would still be fun to have a record of games you played/number of wins. Just for the fun of it. But I get your point&#160;:) 
 Wontonimo: personally, i'd recommend not getting to focused on your CoC score.  CoC is a great place to practice your skills in a new language and watch yourself go from not being able to finish in time to ranking well.  Those pesky python coders are gonna always give you a run for your money, so instead focus on how well you did vs you.  I see some of the live streamers doing that, challenging themselves to compete with new languages.  top notch there
 Wontonimo: wow @Andriamanitra - 14th in CoC!  that's crazy high.  Congrats!
 phantom1299: ruby programmers beat everyone in shortest mode
 MadKnight: true

 Gorgony: Im encoutering a problem with code vs zombies: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/528339342">https://www.codingame.com/replay/528339342</a>. A zombie gets killed twice, and the second time it says my code didnt output a input in time, but the problem is not in my code. Anyone knows (what seems to be) this bug?
 struct: weird bug
 MadKnight: &gt; but the problem is not in my codebut are u sure&#160;?
 Gorgony: Yeah
 Gorgony: I was just starting out
 struct: this seems like a referee bug
 MadKnight: it could be just a thing that happens when u don't print anything
 struct: it even shows that he killed the zombie twice on the replay output
 MadKnight: it just shows the same exact frame from the last turn
 mustafaozx: hello there
 hackrman: general kenobi
 MadKnight: Gorgony it seems that it's just showing the same frame from last turn which could be a thing when u actually don't print anything
 MadKnight: check your code again Gorgony
 Gorgony: I will check again
 Gorgony: I didnt know that the last frame was shown when you dont give an input
 MadKnight: it's just the way they made replay viewer
 MadKnight: it had to show something
 Gorgony: But it seems my code was waiting on a readline while it shouldnt
 MadKnight: maybe
 Gorgony: Thats why console.error also was not in the console
 Gorgony: Because it was after the readline
 Gorgony: Thank you guys

 Gorgony: I already thought it was strange that there would be a bug like this in a game that is several years old
 Gorgony: I should have known it was my code
 Okachobe: Is there any way to post the code to the problem were doing? instead of just the replay.I keep running into a problem which says that my program didnt write to the standard output in time.My code looks almost exactly the same as the solution code and I had this problem earlier too.

 [Kian-carling]: hi
 JLukeSkywalker: darn, need top 2% bots to get the achievement thing. just got stuck at 3%
 JLukeSkywalker: almost there
 jacek: top 2% where
 JLukeSkywalker: multiplayer bots
 jacek: aww
 JLukeSkywalker: for the homepage quest
 Alshock: -3vel
 jacek: that should be top 5%
 JLukeSkywalker: i think if I get to gold in a second game i will hit it
 JLukeSkywalker: and the previous quest is hit gold in a single league
 JLukeSkywalker: so 2% might not be unreasonable
 Wontonimo: thanks, I was wondering what I'd have to reach next on the quest line after gold.  2% it is
 Wontonimo: we both need in the range of 2,500 more points (less for you, more for me) to hit 2%
 JLukeSkywalker: climbing code royale rn, should just under  1k the next calculation
 V-def: helo
 jacek: good evening
 MSmits: hi jacek
 YurkovAS: MSmits in mcts after expand node to children you play random playout games for each unsolved children or only for one child? This give many rollouts, but play worst for me.
 MSmits: i tried both, same result as you
 MSmits: darkhorse had a slightly better result with rolling out from each child
 MSmits: but I never did
 jacek: you have many rollouts, but shallower tree
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I always do that. It also simplifies the implementation
 MSmits: for some other games it was better for me
 MSmits: especially games with less branching
 darkhorse64: When expanding, I allocate a contiguous memory space for children which is completely used. So, it saves space
 MSmits: it's just one of those things that you try for uttt and works differently depending on the rest of your bot
 darkhorse64: Of course, it means you have to tweak the exploration parameter
 darkhorse64: I did that first for uttt. It was a net gain for me
 MSmits: i dont think it's just that, there's tons of little things about a bot that may change the effectiveness
 MSmits: for example, if your rollout is heavier, it might be better to only do 1 each time
 darkhorse64: ept is the other side of the spectrum. Light rollouts but many of them
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: I am amazed you are still finding new ideas for UTTT. How many versions (not variations) did you wrote&#160;?
 MSmits: full versions 3
 MSmits: i mean 3 completely different bots
 jacek: uttt is neverending story
 MSmits: one is EPT, one is a bot with binary representation and heavy pruning, few lookups. One is a ternary representation with less pruning and light rollouts
 Angecide: when going for the one rollout per iteration, do you pick a random unvisited child, or just the first child in the list of children that is unvisited? it feels like picking a random child would give better distribution but also more expensive search
 MSmits: (with heavy lookups)
 MSmits: the EPT bot sucked
 MSmits: Angecide never saw much difference, so i just pick the first
 Angecide: I see
 MSmits: but yeah theoretically random should be better
 MSmits: uttt doesn't always obey the law of making sense
 jacek: oO
 darkhorse64: I have two different engines (binary and ternary) but it did not make any difference. 
 MSmits: which is pretty weird
 MSmits: because working with ternary is very different, it should be much slower or faster... 
 MSmits: but this is my experience a swell
 darkhorse64: Any difference in ranking
 MSmits: no idea
 darkhorse64: I mean ternary and binary engines did not result in any different in ranking for me. I came to the conclusion that it was a kind of dead end for me  and I should try other multis
 MSmits: ahh 
 MSmits: well I still have many ideas to try for uttt, maybe I'll write them up when I am finally done with it
 MSmits: the game has a lot more depth than I first thought
 MSmits: wish i was able to write a good eval for this though, would like to have a competing EPT bot. 
 darkhorse64: One thing I have not tried (learned from other bots) is implementing  the game state with m128. 
 MSmits: I did that, but it's only helpful if you save same time with AVX somewhere
 MSmits: some time
 MSmits: got some small improvements from it, nothing shocking
 darkhorse64: I see I could implement a very fast move generator with that representation. I did something similar with C4. The only issue is randomizing a move choice without pdep/pext
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: I have a move generator like that
 darkhorse64: It takes way too much time to find/select a move with my current engine. 
 MSmits: it's nice for initially getting all the moves
 MSmits: but you still need to check whether the board is actually finished
 darkhorse64: extract 9 bits / lookup
 MSmits: i dont really use extract. I just union the thing with a normal array
 MSmits: easier
 darkhorse64: extracting is needed if the whole game state is a bitboard. My current engine is 10 separate boards. Easy for lookups but bad for move generation. Anyway speed is not that important. I did an experiment: disable optimisation which divides the rollout count by 3 for me. The bot still ranks between 30 and 40. Conclusion; you really need massive speed improvements to gain something. Being smarter pays more
 MSmits: thats true. I did a test once with half calculation time and the winrate was 40% vs my full calc bot
 karliso: "implementing  the game state with m128" Why would you do that? I don't see a single reason how SIMD would help.
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64573132-7abb-4ed6-852a-e0da327cbc3c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/64573132-7abb-4ed6-852a-e0da327cbc3c</a>
 MSmits: right before sim, i can pull out an array of moves this way. Then when the sim starts, i adjust them every time i do a move
 MSmits: saves a little time
 MSmits: might be negligible
 MSmits: but you're right karliso, during sim it's quite hard to use simd for anything
 karliso: This is only useful when you are given free move and can choose from all boards?
 MSmits: sure yeah, it can be used for that
 MSmits: i dont do that though
 MSmits: I mostly use popcounts and pdep and such
 darkhorse64: m128: the idea is to have the game state in one place and perform everything with masks, popcount and friends
 MSmits: i would say m256 though
 Nandita: Has anyone solved the defibrillators challenge?
 darkhorse64: The usual joke is to give you the number of people who did: several thousands
 struct: Since I saw puyo puyo engine on AVX, I believe anything can be made
 MSmits: sure, i think it can be, but it's not always useful
 MSmits: how would you parallelize jumping from board to board
 MSmits: karliso is right that you can only really make good use of it on a free move
 struct: darkhorse64
 struct: check _mm_mask_expand_epi32
 struct: _mm_mask_compress_epi32
 MSmits: that first one requires avx 512
 darkhorse64: You are probably right. Optimizing something that happens less than 10% will not be rewarding. RTFM now :grinning:
 struct: ah
 struct: Yeah sorry
 struct: did not notice it was avx512
 struct: my bad
 struct: they are both for avx 512&#160;:(
 MSmits: some day...
 darkhorse64: Good to know anyway
 ZarthaxX: i used the compress one, love it
 Angecide: MSmits I read yesterday that ur uttt bot had around 2k lines of code which got me speculating on how that happens, is it because there are multiple rollout and mcts algos depending on which side you play on and which stage in the game you are on (early/mid game)&#160;?
 MSmits: for that bot, yeah, that's part of it, though I did not go as far with that as some, probably
 MSmits: it's mostly that i made them really heavy, both expansion and rollout
 MSmits: but this is not my live bot. My live bot is quite tiny
 MSmits: less than 1k if i take out the opening book stuff (it is not being used anyway)
 Angecide: I see, I should probably look into trying some of that as well, the discussion about pure performance on normal mcts having negligible effect compared to sacrificing performance for doing smart rollouts and move selection made me think a lot, but it is quite a challenge to find the right combination of things to get some improvements
 Angecide: improvements as in getting the bot to perform/play better 
 MSmits: yeah it is. Mind you, performance is still important, especially when it's your only edge. But when you start getting creative you can get bigger improvements
 Wontonimo: if alphaGo taught us anything, it's that mcts+heuristics=win
 MSmits: heuristics?
 jacek: nn
 jacek: guided mcts
 MSmits: when someone says heuristics i kinda think of if/else
 MSmits: not a nn
 Wontonimo: doesnt' have to be nn, could be hard coded smarts
 MSmits: i did that in plenty of bots
 Wontonimo: like if/else , board weights
 darkhorse64: i'd say smart eval, whatever it is
 MSmits: also pruning moves
 Wontonimo: yeah ,smart eval is a heuristic
 jacek: pruneArray?
 MSmits: let me give a typical prune for uttt
 MSmits: say you have 2 ways to win
 MSmits: one gives the opponent a free move
 MSmits: one doesnt
 MSmits: in that case, dont include the free move win in your list of children, just ignore it
 MSmits: never explore it
 Angecide: when you say "win" do you mean winning a small board right?
 MSmits: yes sorry
 MSmits: another thing is when there are 2 ways to win
 MSmits: and bot give a free move
 MSmits: both
 MSmits: then only include 1 of them in your list of children
 MSmits: prune the other
 MSmits: there are more of those things
 Angecide: ye pruning sounds cool, until the enemy plays a move that you pruned, then it becomes a bit of a pain to add that node back into the tree
 MSmits: and since expansion is usually not much of a bottleneck, why not make use of them
 MSmits: just reset your whole tree
 Angecide: oh
 Wontonimo: it feels true.  long ago I wrote two checkers bots, one that eval'd on piece count, and the other eval'd on freemove count.  Playing the freemove count bot felt like it was choking you all the time ... where as the piece count bot seemed dumb
 MSmits: tree reuse is overrated
 MSmits: if you prune 1 move, you will have more depth in the others
 MSmits: so it's a gamble
 Angecide: I see, I guess working under the assumption that the enemy will play smart as well seems like a good gamble in high legend
 MSmits: most likely any prune you do is never going to affect the game this way because most expansions happen in parts of the tree that are never going to be encountered in the game
 MSmits: there are only 81 moves played
 MSmits: and millions of nodes expanded
 MSmits: so, why worry&#160;:)
 Angecide: yea that's true
 Damderiam: I'm sure this is a really obvious question, but why is "for i in v:" iterating backwards and skipping index 0 in python where v is a list of integers?
 MSmits: because i are not indices
 MSmits: they are the actual values in the list
 MSmits: v is not sorted i guess
 jacek: v = [4,3,2,1,0]?
 Damderiam: Not sorted, no
 MSmits: it's just iterating over the list in the order in which it is stored
 MSmits: starting with the first element
 Damderiam: I'm doing the stock exchange losses, and I'm doing it fine in C++ but I clearly don't understand python syntax
 jacek: in C++ it would be for (int i&#160;: v) {}
 jacek: what is i?
 Damderiam: I'm trying to iterate from index 0 to index n, which I thought was what "for i in v" did
 Damderiam: i is just an iterator
 MSmits: Damderiam can you do print(v) and tell us what it gives you
 jacek: for i in range(0,n):
 MSmits: a range is basically a list of integers
 Damderiam: v is 5 3 4 2 3 1 in this particular puzzle
 MSmits: and thats why it doesnt give you 0 and goes backward
 MSmits: it starts with 5, then 3, then 4 etc.
 MSmits: when you say "for i in v" 
 MSmits: you're basically saying "for each item i in v"
 MSmits: so i can also be an object
 MSmits: in your case it's an integer
 MSmits: but it could be a list of cars
 MSmits: it would just iterate over the list of cars
 MSmits: you're confusing the items in the list with the indices of the items in the list
 MSmits: v[0] = 5;
 Damderiam: So I am doing it right, I was just not understanding the stderr
 MSmits: possibly
 jacek: "it works. i dont know why"
 Damderiam: Well, I know why the C++ version works, I don't know why the python version doesn't
 Damderiam: But I guess that's part of learning a new language
 MSmits: yeah, i learned python here on CG, by doing all easy puzzles i hadnt solved yet
 MSmits: i did 30 of them in a few days
 MSmits: (while on vacation and my wife was asleep :P )
 Damderiam: It's such an unusual syntax, but I'm sure I'll figure it out
 MSmits: it's not that unusual. Depends on what you're used to
 MSmits: the tab thing with no brackets takes more getting used to
 MSmits: once you get good with python you can do wonderful things with just a few lines of code
 reactToThisVue: for i,e in enumerate(['a','b','c','d','e','f']): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/af434e5f-29a4-4f97-97b7-46804a118d54">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/af434e5f-29a4-4f97-97b7-46804a118d54</a>

 reactToThisVue: sry I didn't mean to send 2 outputs
 reactToThisVue: 2 try
 reactToThisVue: for i,e in enumerate(['a','b','c','d','e','f']): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f192ed3c-811c-4f1b-aa35-782d4322d7b2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f192ed3c-811c-4f1b-aa35-782d4322d7b2</a>
 reactToThisVue: ok, now
 reactToThisVue: so basically it's like MSmits said. Don't get confused with the diference between index (indices) and element (elements) while in the example above i stands for the index and e for the element. You can use them both with enumerate(iterable) in pyhon
 reactToThisVue: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/251451da-898d-4646-8d1b-a874f8775737">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/251451da-898d-4646-8d1b-a874f8775737</a>
 Damderiam: Yeah, I got it working by using enumerate to keep track of the index being worked on for each loop
 reactToThisVue: perfect
 reactToThisVue: otherwise you can reverse the list with list.reverse() or list=list[::-1]
 reactToThisVue: than i and e would match 
 reactToThisVue: also reasonably is the following syntax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2dfd88d7-a0a4-4660-8827-11352254ba70">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2dfd88d7-a0a4-4660-8827-11352254ba70</a>
 Damderiam: I really had to get C++ syntax out of my head was the problem
 Damderiam: I've only barely used python, and not for years, so I was doing everything totally wrong
 reactToThisVue: yeah that's true I've written a lot stuff in c++ and if I would write c++ now I had to google every 2 seconds
 Majeck: .
 Majeck: thought the chat was lagging
 Andriamanitra: i always forget not to play clash at this time of day
 Andriamanitra: i don't understand why they can't have this silly lagfest during the time when no one is playing (about 5 hours from now)
 therealbeef: by then Asia is playing

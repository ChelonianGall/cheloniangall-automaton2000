 derjack: good morning
 punter147: derjack morning. however from my side a good afternoon
 zyh0429: from my side a good evening
 derjack: oO
 zyh0429: do you know any beautiful girls?
 SuryaTheOP: don't you know
 derjack: :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: Retro-kick!
 SuryaTheOP: hloo
 SuryaTheOP: from my side good afternoon
 BlaiseEbuth: mornin'
 SuryaTheOP: clash is becoming worse
 SuryaTheOP: test cases are not relevant to the question
 punter147: SuryaTheOP why?
 derjack: then give it 1 star
 SuryaTheOP: i just now reported 2 clashes
 BlaiseEbuth: Not new
 SuryaTheOP: but i am new
 punter147: its been a while since i have last participated. Rating must have dropped :sad:
 BlaiseEbuth: So don't say 'becoming worse', just 'bad'
 SuryaTheOP: maybe
 derjack: there are some many things on CG and people choose to play clashes
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 SuryaTheOP: maybe for showing of their skills
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 SuryaTheOP: most of them don't share code in clash
 derjack: i wouldn't trust best people in codegolfing to write code
 SuryaTheOP: ahhh codegolfing
 punter147: my last message did not have enough emotion points to show the sad emoji
 derjack:&#160;:(
 SuryaTheOP: have anyonr tried code escape
 punter147: derjack now thats good. let me try being sad again :disappointed:
 SuryaTheOP: i tired but i asking for more people
 BlaiseEbuth: Done the tuto...
 SuryaTheOP: let me try confused :confused:
 punter147: SuryaTheOP lol no i have not tried code escape.
 SuryaTheOP: try it
 SuryaTheOP: but only tutorial you can do
 SuryaTheOP: other than that maybe you need me :smirk:
 darknessrisenow: heyy im jus started coding 
 SuryaTheOP: welcome to the hell
 darknessrisenow: what?
 darknessrisenow: its hell
 SuryaTheOP: maybe 
 darknessrisenow: by the way im 13
 SuryaTheOP: if you want to learn this is not good place
 derjack: :thinking:
 darknessrisenow: I learnt java script
 SuryaTheOP: this place is only for test your skills
 darknessrisenow: yea thats why im here
 SuryaTheOP: if you like clash try to learn python or ruby
 darknessrisenow: I learnt from freecodecamp.org
 SuryaTheOP: :heart_eyes:
 darknessrisenow: and codeacademy
 derjack: then solve some easy puzzles in js
 SuryaTheOP: i agree with dejack
 darknessrisenow: ok
 SuryaTheOP: is anyone from india
 BlaiseEbuth: Thankfully he agreed...
 SuryaTheOP: :joy:
 darknessrisenow: im from india
 SuryaTheOP: in india where
 darknessrisenow: telengana
 darknessrisenow: hyd
 SuryaTheOP: ooo myy god
 darknessrisenow: what?
 SuryaTheOP: i am from andhra
 SuryaTheOP: srikakulam
 darknessrisenow: we live sooo close
 darknessrisenow: :grinning:
 SuryaTheOP: i don't think 730km is close
 SuryaTheOP: :joy:
 darknessrisenow: yea
 darknessrisenow: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngm
 SuryaTheOP: @BlaiseEbuth where you from
 BlaiseEbuth: Hell
 darknessrisenow: a
 darknessrisenow: bruh
 darknessrisenow: youre not scorpion
 darknessrisenow: from mortal kombat
 darknessrisenow: how can you be from hell
 SuryaTheOP: blaise bro please don't give ticket to hell bro
 darknessrisenow: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yeah sorry, I forgot tha Mortal Kombat created Hell for the Scorpion's lore. Nothing to do with some millenary religions... :smirk:
 SuryaTheOP: or for people like us
 SuryaTheOP: okay community byee happy coding
 darknessrisenow: stations and airports you often see this type of screen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e69ded80-b0e9-400c-90d7-e79c76c7c8de">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e69ded80-b0e9-400c-90d7-e79c76c7c8de</a>

 darknessrisenow: yes
 SuryaTheOP: i can explain but my online class has started
 darknessrisenow: what you a student programmer
 SuryaTheOP: blaise  can help you
 darknessrisenow: ok
 darknessrisenow: @blaise
 SuryaTheOP: yes i am computer science student
 SuryaTheOP: still learning
 BlaiseEbuth: Wut? Don't throw him to me like that.
 SuryaTheOP: :joy:
 SuryaTheOP: best mod i have ever seen
 darknessrisenow: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: darknessrisenow stay here. No need to DM
 darknessrisenow: ok
 darknessrisenow: calm down
 SuryaTheOP: yeah he too busy
 BlaiseEbuth: What is the problem exactly.
 KiwiTae: too busy burning souls
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. I automated it
 derjack: like Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what did you change your code to be able to run my code in ide

 InternalErrror: Can we please do a petition to ban minifiers (Chinese characters) from clash of code shortest mode
 BlaiseEbuth: lel
 DaNinja: ban shortest mode
 BlaiseEbuth: ban clashs
 InternalErrror: Ban codingame.com
 aph611418694245154847: ok sure time to use gzip
 Honxrss: hi whats up 
 BlaiseEbuth: ceil
 Honxrss: studying CS, but would really like to get a head start at whats going come up ahead
 WhaIe: I agree with InternalError, it's annoying when people use the utf-16 encoding trick for shortest. Maybe shortest mode should count bytes rather than characters
 sprkrd: there was an argument made in the forum in favour of counting characters instead of bytes. They said they made the challenge more unique in that way, as in most other sites the used metric is byte count
 sprkrd: anyway... you know, maybe shortest mode is not such a big deal?
 sprkrd: it's not like your honor is at play, or you're gonna miss a prize, or it's a particularly useful skill for the daily life
 Uljahn: why is it annoying? just use the same trick [solved]
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 sprkrd: maybe just do it for the funsies (should you be the kind of people who enjoys golfing) and who cares who wins and who loses? you can keep your own version of the ranking in your head in which you separate the ones who use minifiers from the ones who know, if you're not really into that kind of stuff
 KiwiTae: totally agree if u wanna win bad just learn how to use utf16
 KiwiTae: its fair game
 KiwiTae: hehe
 sprkrd: maybe it's just us filthy peasants who don't understand the passion for golfing :joy:
 WhaIe: I don't care about winning, I just think it goes against the spirit of code golfing if you put your code into utf-16 encoding rather than write the shortest code yourself, but it's fine if you guys don't agree lol
 Assassindied: Hello&#160;:) a pro account for coding escape refers to what&#160;?
 Uljahn: utf-16 does not guarantee you a win if your code isn't quite short already
 KiwiTae: +1
 KiwiTae: and doesnt always shorten your code with the overhead
 Uljahn: indeed
 BlaiseEbuth: Codingame have a "for work" part for enterprises Assassindied
 Assassindied: Oh ok&#160;! And is it priced&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course.
 BlaiseEbuth: Not account creation.
 Assassindied: OK&#160;:)
 Assassindied: thanks for the answer&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok...
 BlaiseEbuth: You'll be happy to know that the HTML notation of the color used by CG for the borders of the tables in the puzzles statement is #dadada...

 sprkrd: Whale Anywho, there was a forum thread somewhere where this was being discusses. Maybe you can sum your voice there and get a feeling on the general sentiment about this matter outside for the 4 persons who are in the chat right now. However, I cannot find that thread right now.

 Marchete: hadouken spam is cheating
 Marchete: codegolf can't use some language functions because I say so
 sprkrd: who's spamming? :O
 BlaiseEbuth: The joke fly high above sprkrd...
 Marchete: cheaters on Street Fighter
 Marchete: they just win me with hadoukens
 Marchete: they don't do anything else
 sprkrd: oh, let me tell you why i missed the joke
 sprkrd: my brain filter the very first word of your sentence out (hadouken)
 sprkrd: because it interpreted it as a nickname
 Marchete: ahhh
 Marchete: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Could be :thinking:
 sprkrd: CG has trained me to see the very first word of each sentence as a nickname, as if you were talking to someone
 sprkrd: so I totally ignore it now :joy:
 sprkrd: Anyway, there's not Mr. hadouken spamming messages, then
 sprkrd: there's no*. God, I'm writing awful this morning, skipping letters here and there and using wrong tenses
 Marchete: there's no?
 Marchete: like there isn't?
 sprkrd: there's no Mr. hadouken
 sprkrd: or there's not any Mr. Hadouken
 Marchete: ok
 sprkrd: there's not Mr. Hadouken just sounds awful
 derjack: english~
 Marchete: damn engrish, I'd write it as there isn't any
 sprkrd: also earlier I said "my brain filter" instead of "my brain filters" or "my brain filtered"
 sprkrd: and several other tiny mistakes that I didn't notice before pressing enter
 sprkrd: there isn't any is also good
 Marchete: tortilleishon de patateishon
 sprkrd: depends on where you like your contractions better, i like my nots spelled out :relieved:
 sprkrd: Marchete Unfortunately, I may be the only one getting that joke :joy:
 Marchete: that's more than enough
 sprkrd: I must say you're the only spaniard that I see consistently around
 Marchete: sadly, yes
 Westicles: I've been reading old #fr chats for golf tips.  They love golf, it seems
 derjack: :golf:
 0xdeadc0de1: :sob:
 Westicles: Apparently you are supposed to use the python id() function to generate random numbers and then spam submit until it passes.  Sounds horrible
 Marchete: nice idea
 Marchete: shortest random ever
 sprkrd: what? to what problem?
 sprkrd: It seems like painfully unlikely if there are many test cases
 sprkrd: painfully unlikely to nail down the correct answer, i mean
 Westicles: For temperatures it is easy to get a sort that is close but not quite right.  Like the answer is one of the first two numbers.  That kind of thing
 sprkrd: ah, I undersand
 Marchete: 3 years ago this was my solution for thor
 Marchete: curl hge.men
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 Marchete: 12 chars
 Marchete: and 0.99$
 darkhorse64: the most famous CG codegolf ever
 Marchete: it was fun
 sprkrd: my knowledge on curl is very basic, was hge.men a valid host at the time or is it something else?
 sprkrd: when i try it now it says "Could not resolve host: hge.men"
 Marchete: I bought it
 Marchete: for 0.99
 DomiKo: XD
 Marchete: curl DL a random solution from that server
 sprkrd: ah, sorry, missed that message
 DomiKo: like really? XD
 Marchete: with enough submits it randomly worked
 DomiKo: 0.99$ for code golf
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: :money_with_wings:
 sprkrd: so networks are enabled for our submissions? :O
 RoboStac: not anymore
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 Marchete: were*
 Marchete: only on 2 codegolfs
 RoboStac: I was too cheap and too lazy so only got to 16 chars&#160;:(
 Illedan: What did your page return? Random solution?
 Marchete: peasants
 Marchete: yes, a random solution
 Marchete: like 14 submits until it hits
 derjack: could use it for checkers and connect to chinook for moves
 Illedan: Or any other game for NN weights
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Using a lot of time to tweak a variable, just to find the value it uses are never getting changed
 derjack: so, a constant?
 derjack: amazons again?
 Illedan: Blocking
 Illedan: I used a value set later, so debugging revealed it had changed
 derjack: "Stockfish 14 is now at least 400 Elo ahead of Stockfish 7, a top engine in 2016." oO
 kyoya34: andi andi 
 MSmits: Illedan this reminds me of spending a week fitting weights agains top players in onitama, only to find out it used the same random seed every time
 DomiKo: same story for me, when debugging my CSB found that starting position of POD is fixed value :D
 MSmits: in some sense i am glad CG bench is no longer an option
 MSmits: it's too tempting to spend thousands of games fitting weights. Better to do it locally somehow, even if it's less effective

 TheoreticalPirate_e27d: what do you think the better way to learn game development 
 TheoreticalPirate_e27d: i am already know some stuff ,cding on unity
 Astrobytes: Maybe try asking on a game dev site?
 derjack: this isnt game dev site?
 derjack: but theres game in codingame!
 Illedan: Agreed on CG-bench MSmits. Now we know we have to go that way, but sad for newcommers
 Astrobytes: And annoying when tweaking constants in the IDE 
 Astrobytes: Still, worse things happen at sea I guess
 Illedan: Don't get me started
 BlaiseEbuth: What's sad/annoyng&#160;?
 Illedan: IDE play cap
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh.
 BlaiseEbuth: Shhh! Don't complain, you don't have the right to, since the site is free.

 eulerscheZahl: also: hi
 Illedan: hi
 Illedan: zup?
 BlaiseEbuth: hi
 eulerscheZahl: weekend&#160;:)
 Illedan: Wanna join in on Blocking?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, it's another board game

 eulerscheZahl: right, that one
 Illedan: Yeah, sim is fun
 Illedan: Very hard to get fast
 Illedan: I wonder if I can create some sort of tile tree to speed it up
 eulerscheZahl: don't drag me into your madness
 struct: i was gonna port the 3d version

 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's a thing for real :o
 derjack: is there hex blocking
 eulerscheZahl: i opened the forum&#160;:/<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/codingame-fall-challenge-2021-details-please/191792/6">https://forum.codingame.com/t/codingame-fall-challenge-2021-details-please/191792/6</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i would say i'm shocked. but I already expected it
 derjack: huh
 BlaiseEbuth: Expected what&#160;? That CG will decide things at the last minute&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: that they consider an escape contest
 BlaiseEbuth: No way.
 Astrobytes: Indeed. I'm trying to ignore it.
 derjack: w00t
 Astrobytes: anyway, afk for a bit
 eulerscheZahl: i predicted it before spring 2021 started. just so i can say "told you so"
 struct: will i have to delete again&#160;:/
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't trust you. You know nothing
 Westicles: It could be fun.  You have to solve the escape room to unlock the contest
 Westicles: And then it some nice boring mcts thing
 eulerscheZahl: I also predicted 68c9c0f65e242d686fe26fffc1a830ad7451a2ae4238a9d3f30e0d913e4b2b6c (you can check the chat logs) in early April
 eulerscheZahl: echo -n "hex board, growing trees" | sha256sum
 eulerscheZahl: so i'm good at predicting
 derjack: liar, you just found collision
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: yinsh being potw was also a dead giveaway it would be hex
 struct: since the game doesnt even have a boss
 eulerscheZahl: Dice Duel probably has good chances for PotW soon
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud wants to alternate puzzle authors a bit, as he mentioned once. Sokoban was pretty recent
 eulerscheZahl: but in a few week probably
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Let's do one week eulerscheZahl, one week javaCoffeeCup.
 eulerscheZahl: you may get that PotW too with your path finding
 BlaiseEbuth: I can't until at least 20 users solve it...&#160;:(
 derjack: i bet amazons will be next
 derjack: what path finding?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even know about that 20 solvers limit
 eulerscheZahl: so that's why space maze hasn't been nominated yet? :thinking:

 eulerscheZahl: too much text, won't read that now
 DaNinja: that needs a tl;dr
 eulerscheZahl: and enough coding for today
 FriendlyKh: bye
 FriendlyKh: and hi
 RoboStac: it also needs a tl;di (too long didn't implement) as theres too many rules that are almost the same
 BlaiseEbuth: "rules that are almost the same"?
 RoboStac: princess/dragon/treasure are almost indentical
 BlaiseEbuth: They are.
 BlaiseEbuth: The 3 can be present and only one is the objective.
 BlaiseEbuth: But there's nothing more to implement...
 BlaiseEbuth: All the idea of this puzzle is precisely to force attentive reading and full comprehension.
 BlaiseEbuth: There's not so much redundancy, and not (so) much to do once you fully get it.
 RoboStac: yeah, it just felt like extra complexity that involved more coding that didn't really add anything (as once you'd done one it was easy to do the others) . I quite enjoyed it other than that
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, if you do blocking, I'll do try/catch angle&#160;:)
 derjack: :bribe:
 darkhorse64: No one for Fireworks&#160;?
 Illedan: Is it good?
 darkhorse64: no search, no bitboard, just ifs
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: What is the catch?
 darkhorse64: It's completely different from other multis because you have to play well with others
 eulerscheZahl: there's a catch in tryangle
 AllYourTrees: is that hanabi?
 darkhorse64: yep
 Illedan: euler got it :D 
 AllYourTrees: interesting
 Illedan: Ok, I'll read fireworks statement
 eulerscheZahl: i might just wait for the next contest to play a game
 AllYourTrees: facebook has some research papers about training a NN for hanabi&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: bot contest that is
 darkhorse64: I think these papers are useless in CG context 
 darkhorse64: because they presume all players agree on an implied communication protocol
 AllYourTrees: ya good point
 darkhorse64: implicit sorry
 darkhorse64: There's currently RPS on the top 5. I wonder if bots can be improved
 darkhorse64: Actually, the hard part is to parse the inputs. Once it's done, the fun begins
 Illedan: So... Much... Text...
 darkhorse64: Yes, that's the hard part. Output inputs and it will get clearer 
 derjack: if statement is hard part, then dont read it and code right away
 darkhorse64: inputs are also a wall of text
 AllYourTrees: what am i doing wrong if simd is slower than non simd?
 darkhorse64: very tough and frequent questions. It may take long to load data into SIMD registers
 darkhorse64: unaligned data is problematic for SIMD
 struct: what do you want to do with simd AllYourTrees?
 AllYourTrees: i was trying to convert a matrix vec multiplication to simd
 AllYourTrees: the matrix is kinda small so maybe thats why? 60x32
 RoboStac: that's usually a fairly big speedup, though theres a decent chance the compiler is already doing it
 AllYourTrees: also a high chance that i'm not doing it the best&#160;:) the outputs match between non simd and simd versions hah
 AllYourTrees: not sure what flags rust is compiled with, how could i tell if its doing it already?
 RoboStac: not sure if theres anyway other than looking at the assembly (or forcing it to build with those disabled but I've no idea how you'd do that on rust)
 RoboStac: if you want to paste code it might be something obvious?
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/865ab24f-54d0-4b75-b299-5fd8b2431bcf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/865ab24f-54d0-4b75-b299-5fd8b2431bcf</a>
 darkhorse64: inference code, hehe ... 
 RoboStac: yeah, looks like it should be fine. FMA is sometimes a bit weird depending on processor generation
 darkhorse64: is weights aligned&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: how do you tell if weights is aligned?
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/684243a3-d53f-41ff-a6d3-66b4e1b289b0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/684243a3-d53f-41ff-a6d3-66b4e1b289b0</a>
 AllYourTrees: thats my code the sets up weights
 darkhorse64: OK. Weights are also m256 vars so it should be fine
 RoboStac: might be worth trying to force alignment on the unpacked_output 
 RoboStac: wait, what even is that - isn't that an array 8 long that you are indexing into by multiples of 8?
 AllYourTrees: Ox8 is a const generic, so its an array of the fully output size in this case (32)
 AllYourTrees: O * 8 == Ox8
 RoboStac: ah
 RoboStac: it's an O 
 AllYourTrees: oh yeah hah 
 AllYourTrees: does storeu vs store matter at all?
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: uh hi

 AllYourTrees: is there a difference between broadcast and set1?
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: hi

 RoboStac: broadcast needs the variable to already be in an avx vector

 Astrobytes: Need some information, first
 BlaiseEbuth: Just the basic facts
 Astrobytes: Can you show me where it hurts?
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: do i remember you blaise ebuth
 Westicles: time for the suitcase on the left
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: cause you are kinda firmiliar
 Astrobytes: lol Westicles
 BlaiseEbuth: what's firmilar?
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: ive seen you before but i cant rememmber
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: when
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. I'm stucked here since almost 8 years...
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: ok?:expressionless:
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm on the chat all the day, all days, and since several years. So you probably seen me yesterday, the day befor yesteday, the day before the day before yesterday, the.....
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: what?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes
 Wontonimo: i kinda remember you also BlaiseEbuth :P
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking: Who are you?
 S-Maitland: :grinning:
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: hi im back
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: i just exited the web. and then came back
 Wontonimo: wow, you were in the web?
 Wontonimo: what was it like?
 BlaiseEbuth: sticky
 Wontonimo: neon like Tron
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: i was in the website
 BlaiseEbuth: &lt;body&gt;WaterCooledTopHat_3613&lt;/body&gt;
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: you guy wont understand
 BlaiseEbuth: No. He wont onimo
 Astrobytes: If you don't quit being a tool I'm going to kick you
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Hammer kick!
 Astrobytes: :hammer_pick:
 BlaiseEbuth: Am I really missing a scottish expression, or do you meant fool&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I meant tool.
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: Astrobytes what are you guys talking anout
 BlaiseEbuth: So what's the meaning of this Astrobytes?
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: imean about
 Astrobytes: Pretty close to fool
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: me?
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000 you're a mallet
 Automaton2000: wait for me to do some research
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: i came back you idiot
 struct: :scream:
 Astrobytes: Bye bye.
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BlaiseEbuth: lag
 Wontonimo: lots of attempts at humour has been lost in translation it seems
 BlaiseEbuth: Like the movie?
 Wontonimo: i remember that i've seen lost in translation, but i dont remember it
 Astrobytes: I fell asleep when I went to see that with my gf at the time. Exciting stuff.
 Astrobytes: Same with Big Fish.
 Wontonimo: i liked big fish.  i remember that one
 Astrobytes: I watched it since and it wasn't as bad as I remembered.
 BlaiseEbuth: Sofia copola's movies... :sleeping:
 Millie_yeh_: waiy what
 BlaiseEbuth: What what&#160;?
 Wontonimo: There's no discussion tab on UTTT&#160;;(
 jacek: huh
 Wontonimo: found it
 jacek: phew
 Wontonimo: but on the main UTTT page there isn't a tab for it unlike some other games / puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: file a bug report on discord
 eulerscheZahl: and if you are a puzzle creator, avoid unicode in the title for that exact reason (bug prevents forum thread from being created)
 eulerscheZahl: and because spamming with unicode is childish
 Westicles: looking at you mr beach volleyball
 Wontonimo: oh dear
 Wontonimo: how do i remedy my previous trespasses against the sacred CG?
 BlaiseEbuth: You can't. Your place in Hell is warm and waiting for you.
 Wontonimo: oh good.  it's cold here right now, and I could use a warm fire
 Wontonimo: hey Westicles, if only the approvers caught the unicode title thing
 BlaiseEbuth: You really think approvers read anything before clicking?
 Westicles: heh heh.  jk, I didn't know that was a thing either
 Wontonimo: oh my BlaiseEbuth, I've been doing it all wrong!
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... I'll add some some souls to the fire.
 Wontonimo: 🏐 🏖  unicode everywhere&#160;!!!  🏐 🏖
 Wontonimo: but not in my code!  Don't put unicode in code comments either!  omg, why do these new developers put smiles in the comments?
 Wontonimo: or thumbs up?
 Westicles: Do people still do that thing where you write text on pictures to communicate?  That was the dumbest fad ever
 BlaiseEbuth: Memes?
 BlaiseEbuth: Snapchat?
 BlaiseEbuth: Comics?
 BlaiseEbuth: Posters?
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Westicles: Comics are okay, as long as you don't use any of those fancy names
 Westicles: Just bought the latest Richie Rich graphic novel... sheesh
 jacek: poorie poor?
 Astrobytes: Other than xkcd, this is the only 'comic' worth viewing:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.thefarside.com/">https://www.thefarside.com/</a>
 Westicles: Well, that and Andy Capp
 Astrobytes: lol, that's a name I've not heard for a while
 jacek: boomers these days...
 StevenV: #UTTT
 jacek: :thinking:
 Illedan: Anyone knows how to generate the URL for CGstats with the Blocking game?
 Illedan: oh, nvm. I used the contest url -.-
 Astrobytes: I do that way too often
 jacek: huh
 Illedan: ôO
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Navigating horizontal error print on mac is a pain, suddenly it goes to the previous webpage -.-
 BlaiseEbuth: "mac is a pain" - Illedan, 07/09/21
 Tomo123: anyone using c to code&gt;\?
 jacek: i only use d to dode
 darkhorse64: hope there's no g language
 Uljahn: there is but not on CG
 Illedan: Make your own Language?Include your NN weights into the language and use it on the games in 5 years when CG includes it? :D 
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: :rofl: hahaha
 Illedan: Connect4 or Fireworks?
 Astrobytes: toss a coin
 Illedan: This command does not exist.&#160;:(
 jacek: :bomb:
 jacek: (c4?)
 jacek: or... :notebook: :soccer:
 Illedan: c4 it is, then I can get back into NN
 jacek: back?
 Illedan: Yeah?
 jacek: it implies youve done it before
 Illedan: Sure, my current Oware is just NN without onehot encoding and only 1 output to evaluate the position it looks at
 jacek: value output is all you need
 Illedan: You don't use policy?
 jacek: only noobs use policy ~
 Illedan: :D
 jacek: NN, and youre 69th...
 Illedan: I didn't say it was good
 Illedan: but it works, ISH
 Illedan: Trained for 30 min :P
 Illedan: Damn Astrobytes, you really tried to drop me on Amazons -.-
 Astrobytes: Illedan: not on purpose dude I swear!
 Illedan: Mhm, riiiight
 Illedan: I'll remember this
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: phew he didnt drop me
 Astrobytes: Naw, I'm just playing around with different things. I dropped myself into the -scores earlier 
 jacek: scores?
 Astrobytes: negative score
 Illedan: I think you drop jacek too by losing vs him on negative score :D
 struct: hard to believe this bot was 1st
 struct: i should resubmit
 jacek: yeah, i lose pts in bt or checkers by winning with noobs
 Illedan: bt?
 jacek: breakthrough
 struct: breakthrough
 Astrobytes: breakthrough
 jacek: slowpoke!
 jacek: and there are more mods than people
 Astrobytes: No, 5 mods and loads of people
 Astrobytes: actively chatting, sure
 jacek: i dont see all the people in list
 Astrobytes: I know
 Illedan: Is your Amazons NN jacek?
 jacek: no
 jacek: good old... minimax
 Illedan: What year is it?
 jacek: i have one locally that wins 90% against this one
 Astrobytes: heh
 jacek: but no need to use it now
 Illedan: Lol, hiding community game
 Illedan: But ok
 Astrobytes: I need to bitboard this and make a decent bot
 jacek: my eval is probably similar to your floodfill
 struct: wouldnt call it hiding 
 struct: :p
 Illedan: Dinner time, cya
 Astrobytes: cya later
 jacek: those nandway guys
 Astrobytes: "nandway" :rofl:

 Astrobytes: oh the euros, yes that's accurate
 BlaiseEbuth: eurowhat&#160;?
 jacek: and the finals are in wembley :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Have to be a fool to go to that. Something like 90% of the Scottish fans that travelled there came back with covid lol
 jacek: are scottish for or against england
 Astrobytes: ...
 BlaiseEbuth: #WilliamWallace
 Astrobytes: I mean, the Scots fans didn't travel to Wembley for the England v Scotland match to cheer for England
 BlaiseEbuth: bulshits all of this
 Astrobytes: If you're a Scot living in England you pretend to be happy and encourage them whereas you don't actually care
 Astrobytes: I'm not into football/soccer so I'm not the best judge
 BlaiseEbuth: You are. As I am, since we still have a brain
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: inb4 ngl
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 jacek: yeah, football/soccer is better done on paper
 Astrobytes: :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: :notebook: :soccer:
 BlaiseEbuth: notebook soccer? :thinking:
 MSmits: yes
 Wontonimo: hey mods, question about sharing code.  i posted someone on the UTTT discussion page of how to destroy 3x3 tic tac toe with bitboard and flatMC with a full code example.  I'm assuming that's okay but now double checking
 Wontonimo: it isn't a full UTTT implementation
 jacek: its alright
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 jacek: i posted 3x3 bitboard + ntuple implementation in chat i havent been kicked yet
 MSmits: thats totally fine and also can be found google already
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, lill' things like this are OK. 
 jacek: dont worry, marchete gave full implementation on number shifting :unamused:
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's cool Wontonimo, nice one. I think MSmits is gonna do some explaining in an article too at some point?
 MSmits: it's one of the 3 things I have planned for the summer
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 MSmits: I want to at least explain the 3 ways  I use to represent the state
 Wontonimo: I've helped a couple new joiners get to silver and gold using just FlatMC, and it is so much easier to understand and debug
 MSmits: well 4 if you count the way i use locally
 Wontonimo: when first getting start
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. And is this paper will be free? 
 Wontonimo: and it is fully reusable for MCTS
 MSmits: thats really nice Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: that's cool MSmits
 MSmits: it will be 20% useful (but really useful for some people) and just 80% filled with weird out-there stuff almost noone will use.
 MSmits: but i will separate the two clearly&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i want to ask what these 4 ways are, but i'm guessing you'll share when you write it up
 kysty: uh, anyone got example for the obtuse triangle code clash? all test worked except test3 for some reason???
 MSmits: well binary, ternary, and my hard to explain system that I really need an article for
 struct: wontonimo a lookup was faster
 struct: was/is
 struct: at least for me
 struct: But i think its a good thing anyways so more people can understand avx
 Wontonimo: my current uttt bot uses a lookup (512 states)
 MSmits: maybe I'll include some other games in my article. at some point i developed an obsession with shrinking gamestates to be as small as possible (bit-wise)
 jacek: so is mine
 MSmits: struct i just said this to Wontonimo in a PM
 MSmits: you told me that
 Wontonimo: oh, you know what MSmits ... i'm wrong.  i was comparing a loop of 8 win moves to the avx, not a lookup
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yeah thats gonna be slow
 struct: yeah the loop is slower than the avx
 jacek: welp i stopped caring about game performance that much since nn is more costly
 MSmits: when you've spent a lot of time maxing out bot performance for various, you kinda do it automatically, whether it is needed or not
 MSmits: for various games
 Astrobytes: ^ this is how you become struct :D
 struct: i didnt optimize for c4
 Astrobytes: WHAT
 Astrobytes: Shocking.
 Astrobytes: You have failed us
 struct: ofc i did it was the first thing
 MSmits: i didnt either, my bot is still my first version except some small change suggested by struct
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: my first thing was rollout function like I said before
 struct: since i dont care anymore about c4
 struct: this is how i update the mask
 MSmits: ohh... gold incoming
 Wontonimo: thinking of one punch man's secret to how he got so strong
 MSmits: :open_hands:
 jacek: gold?
 struct: mask = (mask + (511ULL * opp_winning_moves)) &amp; 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
 Marchete: I gave full Number shifting, yet only 1 guy used it ever...
 MSmits: structs secret
 struct: ups not that one
 struct: mask = (mask + (511ULL * pdep)) &amp; 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
 struct: its equal to
 jacek: Marchete i used it for about 20 levels
 MSmits: what are you pdepping
 struct: mask + ((pdep &lt;&lt; 9) - pdep)
 Marchete: I care for the climate change
 struct: const uint64_t pdep = _pdep_u64((1ULL &lt;&lt; rand(__builtin_popcountll(mask))), mask);
 Marchete: don't waste 4hours per level if you can do it in 10 mins
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/737e6c74-d3c6-4145-9298-5ca870d79851">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/737e6c74-d3c6-4145-9298-5ca870d79851</a>
 struct: it was faster than setting and clearing bit
 struct: at least for me
 MSmits: Marchete you think of things faster than i can use them
 sprkrd: Marchete I think that the people keen enough to actually know how to run your code for number shifting tend to be also the proud ones who would prefer to solve the game themselves
 MSmits: thanks for sharing struct
 Astrobytes: yes indeed, pretty nifty
 Marchete: yeah, maybe I shouldn't share it
 MSmits: sprkrd i think he made it pretty easy though
 MSmits: easier than mokka anyways
 Marchete: but it was like 30.000% faster than any other approach, damn
 Westicles: Yes, I agree sprkrd.  Very proud
 Marchete: :D
 Astrobytes: Marchete: I don't think there's much wrong with sharing it
 Marchete: also, it was 2 years old
 Marchete: or more
 MSmits: the puzzle you mean?
 Marchete: yes
 sprkrd: Marchete I wasn't condemning you, I was supporting you :O
 MSmits: well it was never about getting a maximum score. It was more like a normal puzzle, only with 1000 of them
 Astrobytes: oh hey sprkrd
 sprkrd: hello Mr. Laing&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: I regret nothing! :D
 struct: np, ofc the performance diference doesnt come from there, I wont share the avx functions though to keep multi integrity
 Astrobytes: I still haven't written anything for numbershifting, I did it by hand, like Uljahn, maybe some others?
 MSmits: i sucked at doing it by hand
 Astrobytes: Naturally struct&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah dont share that
 Marchete: don't start then Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Westicles: I was against it at first, but I was determined to spend the year burning up my computer to solve it.  Instead it took 28 hours.  Amazing solution
 Marchete: westicles I were on your same boat
 Marchete: I had literally a cloud farm of cpu
 Marchete: 70x cores
 MSmits: how many google accounts with free cloud computing is that
 Marchete: preemptive are cheap
 Astrobytes: :heavy_dollar_sign:
 Marchete: also there are more cloud providers
 Marchete: but you are on point&#160;;)
 MSmits: I wonder how many times this happens in practice, when doing heavy calculations (in science and business). Them using 300x more time because of an inferior algorithm
 Astrobytes: A lot. But for most research purposes it doesn't matter apparently
 sprkrd: Yes, that's called reinforcement learning
 Wontonimo: like 100% of the time
 Marchete: I'd say domain knowledge
 sprkrd: it's what they used for alphazero
 sprkrd: :clown:
 MSmits: pennywise!
 Astrobytes:  :balloon: :balloon: :balloon:
 MSmits: damn you beat me to it
 Astrobytes: The only time I won today I think
 sprkrd: now seriously, some breakthrough has to happen at some point, it cannot be that we have to spend thousands of kilowatts to just learn a stupid board game
 Wontonimo: at where i work, laziness leads to huge REST request and bloated DB payloads.  Azure loves us for all the billing they get to do
 Wontonimo: not to mention all the lag caused by it
 MSmits: well I guess there's always a tradeoff between dev time and cpu efficiency
 MSmits: otherwise why would there be python
 Wontonimo: and because it is all so inefficient, it has to be distributed across a larger server farm, and that adds additional overhead costs
 Wontonimo: right you are MSmits, there really be a tradeoff.
 Astrobytes: Kinda why I never went into research
 jacek: welp nnue shows you can have a0/lc0 performance with a fraction of power
 MSmits: in some domains i guess?
 Marchete: well, in general I can't say NN are power efficient
 Marchete: most of these use like hundreds GPUs to learn
 sprkrd: i don't think NN are the largest problem, really
 jacek: yeah its very specific
 MSmits: that depends on what you compare them with
 AllYourTrees: wouldn't the main thing from NNUEs (that the input changes very little from last step) apply to a lot of things?
 Marchete: TPU or whatever
 AllYourTrees: or am i misunderstanding NNUEs
 MSmits: if you compare a nn with a similar strength normal mcts bot, the nn is wayyyyy more efficient
 MSmits: as it will require a fraction of the calculation time
 Marchete: + N hours of training
 jacek: but more time in 'training'
 MSmits: yes but that is only the initial investment
 MSmits: you can use it forever afterwards
 MSmits: its like solar power
 MSmits: big investment at first, pays off later
 sprkrd: I think the problem is having to need millions of play-outs to actually fine tune the function approximator. There's an algorithm in RL called HER (Hindsight Experience Replay) that I like quite a bit because it cuts down enormously the number of examples that you need to feed to your network
 MSmits: btw dont use solar to power nn
 AllYourTrees: and then they make 1 tiny change to the board game rules and you have to retrain lol
 sprkrd: the problem with that is that is that it's not easy to extrapolate to adversarial games
 MSmits: I am great at hindsight
 sprkrd: the idea is pretty neat: they say, OK, you haven't reach your goal in this episode, BUT if the goal was actually the state you reached by the end, then you would have succeeded. And with that, they learn even from failed episodes
 Marchete: alphazero learns from losses too
 Wontonimo: yeah, i really liked that idea sprkrd.  I'd like to reread that paper if you've got the link handy
 Marchete: I find AZ simple to understand the learning process
 Wontonimo: is it this one you are thinking of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495">https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495</a>
 sprkrd: Wontonimo there's a video by two minutes papers with a link to the paper in the description: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvd1jQe3pq0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvd1jQe3pq0</a>
 Marchete: play, use win/loss and visits each turn as learning samples
 Marchete: not those DDQN math
 Marchete: I can't understand
 sprkrd: Wontonimo yep, that one&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: one thing i don't like how AZ needed to add noise and sampling action to force exploration, it seemed lke that was really important
 Marchete: neither do I
 Marchete: but I guess random noise cancels out
 Marchete: with enough samples
 jacek: how else youd explore
 sprkrd: isn't adding noise like an alternative mechanism to eps-greedy?
 RoboStac: yeah, otherwise you play thousands copies of the same game
 AllYourTrees: yeah but i also don't like epsilon greedy&#160;:)
 RoboStac: as it's deterministic
 jacek: eplsilon greedy is meh
 jacek: with noise you choose not so crappy alternatives
 sprkrd: i guess softmax would be mathematically more elegant, but it's a bit more computationally expensive
 Wontonimo: I believe the temperature function is noise in favour of the likely, so quite different than softmax
 Wontonimo: They start with a temperature of 1 and then reduce to 0.3 during training iirc
 Wontonimo: so at the start it really is like softmax, but then it moves to be very close to deterministic
 sprkrd: but are you talking about AZ, Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: let me double check and see if i can find a source about the temperature thing
 AllYourTrees: for temperature they start with temp of 1 and then reduce it to 0 after 30 turns i think
 sprkrd: so if I get you correctly, you're talking about doing softmax dividing the exponent by T, am I right?
 AllYourTrees: i.e. select best move start at turn 30
 RoboStac: yeah, I think alphago had a slowly reducing temperature and alphazero just had 1/0 
 sprkrd: so exp(-x / T) / sum(all the exps)?
 Marchete: the temperature thing is just a way to control a weighted random selection
 Marchete: weighted as the more visits you have, the more chances you have
 Wontonimo: yes, T=1 is just softmax
 Marchete: and temperature is just pow(visits, 1/temperature)
 Wontonimo: T=0 = max
 Marchete: I don't think it's about softmax here
 sprkrd: how do you keep track of visits when you're using function approximation?
 Marchete: temperature is for when you end searching in a turn
 AllYourTrees: the function approximate just takes the place of a rollout in MCTS
 Marchete: you have a MCTS tree
 Marchete: with childrens, each one with visits count
 Marchete: what children do you pick as best move?
 Marchete: normally it should be the most visits
 Marchete: but for giving diversity
 Marchete: you do a random weighted
 Wontonimo: a rats, stuff got interesting and I've gotta go.  later ppl
 sprkrd: see you Wontonimo
 Marchete: at some point
 Marchete: at turn 30
 Astrobytes: later dude
 Marchete: they just say: "no more random, just pick the move with more visits"
 Marchete: that's the temperature zero or infinite can't remember
 Marchete: I prefer to way it as pow(visits, factor)
 sprkrd: I always forget about the look-ahead aspect of AZ, I have in my mind a clearer picture of actor critic
 Marchete: the bigger the factor the more frequent higher visits are randomly picked
 Marchete: that's one source of diversity in AZ
 Marchete: also they have dirichlet noise
 Marchete: in the root expansion only
 Marchete: so expand 1st children
 Marchete: then add some noise
 Marchete: "dirichlet" in this case
 Marchete: tldr it's just a vector&lt;float&gt; that sums 1
 Marchete: so it doesn't break the softmax (that also sums 1)
 AllYourTrees: when you construct the target for the visits, do you do a softmax or just divide by the sum of the visits?
 sprkrd: in the upcoming months I'll have to use muzero as a baseline to compare against my own work, so in the process I guess I'll consolidate my knowledge about AZ.
 AllYourTrees: like after you run mcts how do you make the policy target that you stick in the buffer
 RoboStac: just divide by the root visit count
 AllYourTrees: okay ya thats what i do, idk if that or softmax makes a difference
 AllYourTrees: they probably produce different policies
 Marchete: it gives different
 AllYourTrees: which do you do Marchete
 Marchete: more flat
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L17-L18">https://github.com/marchete/CGZero/blob/master/src/CGZero.cpp#L17-L18</a>
 AllYourTrees: probably have numerical issues if you try to raise e^500
 Marchete: I first divide
 Marchete: otherwise it gives nan
 Marchete: but after divide I tried to softmax
 jacek: there is some trick to make softmax safe
 jacek: minus the max?
 Marchete: yeah
 RoboStac: well, you'd do stable softmax by subtracting the max 
 RoboStac: in the same way you hopefully do on the forward layer
 Marchete: maybe I should do that
 gkacitadze: who can help me?
 jacek: with?
 MSmits: general advice to life i think
 MSmits: don't pee into the wind
 MSmits: don't eat yellow snow
 Marchete: but I just don't use softmax, I guess it's a matter of sub max value, then softmax
 sprkrd: MSmits two advices and both have to do with peeing
 jacek: omorashi eh
 MSmits: mmh I see the pattern now
 AllYourTrees: i don't think just subtracting max would work
 jacek: but it does
 Marchete: why=
 Marchete:&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: if you have [100, 200, 400, 50, 50], then you'd end up with [-300, -200,    0, -350, -350]
 sprkrd: yup
 AllYourTrees: wouldn't that still be pretty unstable??
 sprkrd: nope
 AllYourTrees: e^-350?
 sprkrd: large negative values would tend to 0
 sprkrd: going towards 0 is alright
 sprkrd: going to inf isn't
 AllYourTrees: ahhh okay
 Marchete: python with numpy and jupyter notebook is a good way to test all these
 sprkrd: I also like sagemath quite a bit
 sprkrd: is python+jupyter+ you get to visualize your outputs in nicely formated latex documents
 Marchete: I have zero graphs of my learning process :D
 Astrobytes: :stonks:
 MSmits: stonks?
 Astrobytes: google it
 MSmits: I already googled jaceks urine feitsh thingy
 MSmits: i am at my quotum
 jacek: huh
 Marchete: robo, did you tried fixed point int16 math for NN?
 Astrobytes: what?
 MSmits: omorashi
 jacek: ah
 Marchete: try*
 RoboStac: yeah, my current c4 is float training with int16 on submit
 jacek: i thought it was random japanese word
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: oh good lord, didn't need to google that
 Astrobytes: No you didn't jacek
 MSmits: well I trust jacek blindly
 RoboStac: it's about 20% faster
 jacek: maybe you shouldnt
 MSmits: I am starting to think that too
 RoboStac: and technically could go horribly wrong as my relu isn't capped
 Marchete: it shouldn't be near 100%?
 Marchete: with capped
 Marchete: like trying to keep all in like -1.5 .. 1.5 range
 MSmits: forgive me for thinking stonks is a poo thingy after looking up jaceks word Astrobytes
 Marchete: convert to -32767..32767
 Marchete: and use that special mult with msb
 Astrobytes: Forgiven MSmits
 MSmits: :grin:
 RoboStac: it reduces the number of multiplications by 2, but theres still lots of other bits that are the same
 Marchete: In my head I see it all as int16
 MSmits: are you asleep when that happens Marchete
 RoboStac: all the additions are int32 (as int16*int16 is int32)
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm256_mulhrs_epi16&amp;expand=4981">https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm256_mulhrs_epi16&amp;expand=4981</a>
 MSmits: just asking for a friend who had that happen is all
 jacek: the universe can be compressed into int16
 Marchete: int16xint16=int16
 jacek: he meant the sum will overflow so you need bigger int to store it
 Marchete: int16xint16-&gt;int32-&gt;shiftR16
 Marchete: in 1 instruction
 Marchete: fixed point math
 RoboStac: hmm, more innacuracies. Might work though
 Marchete: big innacuracies :D
 RoboStac: it's already scary how wrong it is on equal positions
 Marchete: but I just want to ask about if that was tried
 Marchete: cummulative 1.0/30000.0 error
 Marchete: more or less
 RoboStac: lets have a go, should be a quick change
 Marchete: quick change?
 Marchete: lel
 Marchete: for me it's like a massive overhaul
 RoboStac: well, I've got all the int16 conversions, just need to change the additions / relu steps
 Marchete: because I need to check my values all over can't overflow
 MSmits: lel, lul and lol are all Dutch words btw, not abbrevs, real words
 Marchete: lol
 MSmits: that means fun
 RoboStac: yeah, mine has the potential to overflow
 RoboStac: tried 20 games and it never got close though
 Astrobytes: isn't one ass or something?
 MSmits: lul is penis
 Marchete: \o\   lol  /o/
 MSmits: lel is slap in the face
 Marchete: ppl waving
 jacek: hm? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aAY2rXg_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aAY2rXg_700bwp.webp</a>
 MSmits: or just punch, not sure
 Astrobytes: ah, I knew it was Down There
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: lol jacek
 MSmits: the sign basically says, Mon, that one, that one, that one, please
 MSmits: Mom

 Astrobytes: Lies. Psychotic dutch children.
 Astrobytes: (joking)
 MSmits: well some are imho
 Astrobytes: That's not just a Dutch thing
 MSmits: sure, but Dutch children are bigger
 Westicles: yeah, I heard about a dutch kid putting his finger in a leaking dyke
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: he probably thought it was an electrical socket
 sprkrd: the first thing I saw when I looked at the chat again was MSmits saying "lul is penis". I thought his account got vandalized
 MSmits: haha
 sprkrd: and then I thought people were celebrating his momentary lapse of childish behavior
 MSmits: wait if you lapse your childish behavior, doesnt that mean you stop being childish
 MSmits: mmh
 Astrobytes: Yes. That's called not living properly.
 sprkrd: lapse also means "moral failure"
 MSmits: I see
 Marchete: you can't be childish with students I guess
 Astrobytes: Why not?
 MSmits: well most of mine are 16 and older 
 Astrobytes: The very peak of childishness
 MSmits: a certain type  i guess&#160;:)
 Marchete: the worst
 Astrobytes: yes That Type
 MSmits: don't get many of those thankfully
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: Still, never lose your inner child. You lose touch with the world.
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: real scientists never lose it
 MSmits: science is basically: "hmm what happens if i do this "
 MSmits: and that's what being a child is

 MSmits: i did that too
 jacek: and now youre bald
 Astrobytes: 100%
 MSmits: that too
 Astrobytes: Those two memes are on point
 MSmits: I remember one time mixing some carbonated drinks, putting a lid on and shaking it
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: nice explosion. Had to clean up kitchen though
 Astrobytes: I had the sense to do (most of) these things outside
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: thats were my parents were
 struct: i had a friend that took carbonated drink in a bicycle ride
 MSmits: nice one
 Astrobytes: Sodium metabisulfite and citric acid reaction in my bedroom was not good though
 Astrobytes: I even had the windows open
 Astrobytes: and did it on the windowsill
 jacek: struct like this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/NefQSich.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/NefQSich.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: Some smell
 MSmits: one time I was tired after a parent-teacher thing and took some free coca cola home with me in a plastic beaker with lid. Was too tired to think about it
 MSmits: and that one exploded in the train
 struct: "Zoinks! You've taken a wrong turn."
 struct: doesnt work jacek
 Astrobytes: That was only last year wasn't it? Year before MSmits?
 jacek: you tried?
 MSmits: you dont want to explode things on a train I tell you
 struct: the link doesnt work
 MSmits: i think 3 yrs ago already
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: but yeah i might have told this before, apparently
 Astrobytes: wow, time flies
 jacek: imgur doesnt work for you?
 Astrobytes: I remember you were really happy about the free cola
 MSmits: yes!
 struct: i think cg messed it up
 struct: copy and paste worked
 MSmits: stores are closed and i didnt want to drink water
 MSmits: i still ended up drinking the cola too, the half that was not all over my face and clothes
 Astrobytes: Of course. Waste not, want not.
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: btw got my 1st vaccine shot yesterday
 Wontonimo: suck it out of the fabric.  Get cola and clean your clothing at the same time
 MSmits: lol
 Wontonimo: congrats Msmit&#160;!
 MSmits: nothing like ending a 14 hr work day by sucking on your clothes
 Astrobytes: Tastes like whatever you used to clean your clothes, tried that with expensive drinks before when younger :P
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: Wontonimo yeah I could not move my arm all day though, it's now getting better finally
 jacek: :smirk:
 Wontonimo: clean your clothing using turkey juice Astrobytes , solves the problem
 Astrobytes: hehe yeah mine was like that for 2-3 days
 MSmits: ah that sucks
 jacek: pfizer?
 MSmits: apparently the second shot could be worse?
 MSmits: yeah jacek
 Astrobytes: Same
 jacek: it is a llitle worse
 jacek: i was sleepy all week
 jacek: but that could be heatwave
 Wontonimo: i got my second on wednesday.  yesterday i couldn't figure out if i wanted to barf or explode out the back end all day
 Wontonimo: not a fun day yesterday
 Astrobytes: I had a bit of fatigue on the day after but otherwise was cool
 Wontonimo: today i'm good
 Astrobytes: nice, much better day 
 Westicles: all those spike proteins collecting in your ovaries can make you sleepy, sure
 MSmits: sounds a bit like stomach flu Wontonimo
 MSmits: noro virus
 MSmits: there's always the remote possibility you caught something else
 Astrobytes: when I got covid my first symptom (other than feeling real strange and a fever) was back end material
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: let's take bets on how long it takes jacek to find a meme for that Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: followed by vomiting, then flu like symptoms, then OK after a week or so
 Astrobytes: And then it came back.
 AllYourTrees: i just had a headache after my second pfizer shot
 AllYourTrees: my mom didn't have many symptoms either. wife was out of commission for the next day lol
 MSmits: my wife was like that for 1 day after 1st shot
 codeing: hello
 MSmits: you forgot world
 codeing: wanna ask a question
 Astrobytes: My mum had the AZ one and was cool with the first, second one did her for a week, vomiting and fever mostly
 struct: No symptoms, but I havent taken the vaccine yet
 AllYourTrees: oh wow
 codeing: what kind of game of logic allow to improve programming skills&#160;?
 codeing: anyone have any idea&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: any practice programming will help you improve programming&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes also: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oseqh7SMIvo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oseqh7SMIvo</a>
 struct: I dont use logic, i use performance
 codeing: how performance&#160;?
 jacek: connect 4 and oware are now hyped
 Marchete: 1st pfizer shot, just arm pain
 codeing: cool jacek
 Marchete: well, really in the 1st 5 minutes after the shot, I got some symptoms, but lasted just a couple of minutes luckily
 AllYourTrees: thats good
 Astrobytes: or not - unless an allergic response there should be nothing happening other than a sore arm for the first 10-15 minutes
 Astrobytes: 30 mins being a reasonable time to wait for allergic response
 jacek: and 1 hour before the upload is complete
 Astrobytes: Yes! I now have 5G thoughts and I am Magneto
 struct: i would not mind having 5G
 Astrobytes: Bill Gates speaks to me through my arm and I have intimate knowledge of Deep State activities.
 Astrobytes: Honestly, the conspiracies are hilarious
 Marchete: you intimate with him?
 Marchete: wow 5G is amazing
 codeing: connect 4 and oware are cool, but don't you know a soft app&#160;?
 codeing: software&#160;?
 codeing: jacek&#160;?
 sprkrd: what do you mean a software?
 codeing: hmm
 Westicles: he wants something for his phone
 codeing: sure
 codeing: or personal computer
 Westicles: a game that will help learn programming
 Astrobytes: 5g of most things is enough for a good... oh nvm
 codeing: yes
 sprkrd: you want a game?
 codeing: game of logic
 sprkrd: spacechem
 codeing: lemme check
 codeing: seem cool
 sprkrd: also infinifactory, factorio, and of course space engineers
 codeing: hmm
 sprkrd: any game by zachtronics
 Astrobytes: TIS-100
 Astrobytes: yes
 sprkrd: yeah, TIS-100 indeed
 Astrobytes: any
 sprkrd: also kerbal space program
 codeing: cool
 sprkrd: and i'm gonna stop there, plenty of games already :D
 jacek: or openttd
 codeing: thx
 Astrobytes: never tried Kerbal actually
 sprkrd: I have not tried Kerbal myself, either. I have plenty with Factorio, Spacechem and Space Engineers, I don't want to fall into the rabbit hole of yet another game :joy:
 sprkrd: But I have seen a couple of videos of KSP and it looks pretty amazing
 Marchete: city skylines
 Marchete: cities*
 Astrobytes: MSmits plays Space Engineers too right?
 sprkrd: yeah, he's a big fan
 sprkrd: it was his excuse to learn C# if I remember correctly
 Astrobytes: I haven't actually played that either, though I know more about it
 Astrobytes: Yes, correct
 Astrobytes: And shader programming
 Astrobytes: I liked Opus Magnum from Zachtronics when I needed a break from actually writing things
 sprkrd: Opus Magnum's received a lot of praise, but unfortunately I haven't tried it
 sprkrd: Many people say it's their best game
 Astrobytes: It's actually very cool. Same metrics for performance as the other games, it's very polished
 Astrobytes: But sometimes you're more in a TIS-100 or Exapunks mood
 MSmits: yep learned C# for space engineers
 jacek: polished eh
 sprkrd: :joy:
 sprkrd: it took a while, but I finally understood where you're getting at
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF3i_xeC1aQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF3i_xeC1aQ</a>
 MSmits: this is one of the silly things i was up to with scripting and modding
 MSmits: accurate gravity simulation
 sprkrd: that looks cool :D
 sprkrd: and the mod looks very nice
 MSmits: I also wrote a mod that used marching cubes algorithm to project asteroids
 MSmits: and created models of grids
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia7-XIMny60">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia7-XIMny60</a>
 sprkrd: how do you do the actual checking whether there's a chunk of asteroid in a voxel? does the API provide you that functionality?
 MSmits: if the game is running on your computer and the asteroid is rendered (within 10 km i think)
 Astrobytes: Don't forget the sales opportunity of Your Sphere MSmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh right, but that was unity, not space engineers
 Astrobytes: Still apllicable
 Astrobytes: *applicable
 MSmits: sure, yes that was also C#
 MSmits: the holo projector mod was actually used by a few thousand players
 MSmits: but it broke on some patch
 MSmits: some guy paid me to fix it which i did
 MSmits: but then it broke again a few patches later
 Astrobytes: looked very nice, I think I only saw your marching cubes one
 MSmits: the channel also has a bunch of videos with me making weapons and targeting them
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InOfbI3tIbg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InOfbI3tIbg</a>
 sprkrd: yeah, I've seen you're quite the influencer
 MSmits: this one was pretty cook. a swarm of scripted 1 thruster bombs
 MSmits: cool
 sprkrd: oh wow
 sprkrd: 2015
 Astrobytes: looks more like a bomb than a cruise missile lol
 sprkrd: you've been in this business a long time, mr. smith
 MSmits: yes, the cruise missile was another video
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcQump_jPI8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcQump_jPI8</a>
 MSmits: this one
 Astrobytes: Still watching the other one, very cool
 MSmits: yeah they are all poorly coded C# scripts, these arent mods
 MSmits: thats just what the normal game allows
 MSmits: which is what makes space engineers an awesome game
 MSmits: you can place a programmable block and code it in game
 Astrobytes: scriptable games are always fun
 MSmits: in a really poor ide
 Astrobytes: meh, fook that
 Marchete: checklist for evil scientist
 Marchete: cruise missile - check
 Marchete: sharks with lasers?
 Astrobytes: he'll need to team up with me for shark lasers
 MSmits: I did make a robot, does that count
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWxt9m7CEhA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWxt9m7CEhA</a>
 MSmits: it didnt do anything though, just looked cool 
 kysty: is there a way to see which lap you are on in coders strike back?
 Astrobytes: very lul-ish
 sprkrd: MSmits like Boston Dynamics!!
 MSmits: yeah except it cant walk
 Marchete: well, a giant robot
 sprkrd: kysty from the code, no, no until you get to gold league
 Marchete: hell yes, right to the list
 MSmits: oh, another evil scientist one
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cccVaJ77XMA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cccVaJ77XMA</a>
 MSmits: think this was one of my first
 MSmits: it makes a wheel of missles, then explodes the center part and launches them all
 Marchete: just add a nuclear warheaad and you are good to go
 Astrobytes: Can we implant this in a shark?
 sprkrd: I think they're called just "warheads", they don't specify whether they're nuclear or not
 MSmits: yeah thats right
 MSmits: I preferred using normal stone ore though
 MSmits: accelerating with gravity generators
 Astrobytes: Effective
 MSmits: unfortunately other servers would delete them as rubble
 Astrobytes: lol
 sprkrd: you don't strike me as the type who goes on-line
 MSmits: nah i didnt much, but sometimes people told me about stuff they tried
 Astrobytes: highly accelerated rubble is surely as destructive as any other weaponry
 MSmits: this is a really short video where i experimented with graphics modding
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIcQUcdOMpg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIcQUcdOMpg</a>
 MSmits: wormholes
 MSmits: never finished it though
 Astrobytes: Thank god that wasn't emh style
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i would not do that :P
 Astrobytes: are those potatoes
 MSmits: those are stone ore thingies
 Astrobytes: They're potatoes now
 MSmits: sure ok 
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: unfortunately i could not use this for ships
 Astrobytes: Nice though
 Astrobytes: Why?
 MSmits: because they are complicated objects consisting of many parts
 MSmits: it would just all teleport at once
 Astrobytes: Oh I see
 MSmits: would look silly
 MSmits: if I had not found CG I would still be making silly weapons in SE
 MSmits: or stuff in unity i guess
 Astrobytes: Well, I think we're all glad you found CG, SEs loss
 MSmits: me too&#160;:)
 sprkrd: I'm leaving now, good night everyone&#160;:)
 MSmits: gn sprkrd!
 Astrobytes: goodnight, all the best&#160;:)
 sprkrd: idem ^^
 Astrobytes: :D
 JoshTheCodingMaster: hi
 Marchete: you can't compare multis and challenges with all these script games
 JoshTheCodingMaster: yes
 Marchete: some AI "fights" are very interesting
 JoshTheCodingMaster: uh huh
 Astrobytes: I don't believe anyone was comparing the two Marchete 
 Astrobytes: Just purely on an MSmits basis
 Marchete: it's about the competitive part
 Marchete: most of us improved tenfold
 Marchete: in algorithms and AI
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure
 Marchete: being alone in these games
 Astrobytes: In that respect, definitely
 Marchete: you don't have any real objective
 Marchete: do crazy stuff
 Marchete: he'd miss us even if he never went to CG...
 MSmits: yeah scriptable games are different, but SE goes quite far with this compared to other games, i dont think there's anything like it. I think you could build a board out of blocks, create an AI controlling a gravity engine and play checkers against it
 MSmits: or let it play against itself
 Marchete: minecraft seems similar
 MSmits: only if you mod it
 MSmits: it doesnt have scripting in a vanilla version
 Astrobytes: Yeah but minecraft is a lot more long-winded afaik
 MSmits: unless you mean that redstone stuff
 Astrobytes: I never cared for it myself
 Astrobytes: (minecraft)
 MSmits: another huge difference
 MSmits: minecraft has no physics
 MSmits: stuff you make and control in SE has newtonian phyusic
 MSmits: physics
 MSmits: which makes AI much more interesting
 Astrobytes: true
 MSmits: mine craft is also mostly 2D
 MSmits: as in, the world is infinite in 2 dimensions and in the 3rd it's finite
 MSmits: i think like 130 blocks or so?
 MSmits: SE is real 3D
 RoboStac: so remind me never to think I can quickly test something to do with crazy int things&#160;:(
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 struct: what hapened?
 Marchete: sorry robo&#160;:(
 Marchete: my fault
 struct: I won 2 games vs robo?
 struct: what sorcery is this
 RoboStac: yeah, either I'm overflowing with new maths or the accuracy loss is too much
 Marchete: a pity
 RoboStac: though I did just beat msmits
 RoboStac: so it's possible I might just leave it
 Marchete: it was "faster" at least?
 RoboStac: it's about 10% faster
 Marchete: to do tests myself
 Marchete: only?
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f1b3aaf-6f89-4ec6-8df4-5288cd2e65e8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f1b3aaf-6f89-4ec6-8df4-5288cd2e65e8</a>
 Marchete: from float?
 RoboStac: no
 RoboStac: from the int16 with 32 bit additions
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: bummer
 Marchete: I thought near 2x
 RoboStac: that's time to do 10000000 inferences
 Marchete: because half size
 RoboStac: and then the ouput from each (9 policy / 1 value)
 Marchete: seems more inaccurate, yes
 MSmits: did it stop using the same opening RoboStac?
 RoboStac: it does look to have switched off the one you mentioned, yeah
 MSmits: cool 
 struct: I think its a good time for resubmit&#160;:)
 Marchete: so int8 is better?
 Marchete: I always think that only 256 values are too low...
 RoboStac: seemed to work for oware
 RoboStac: my c4 training hasn't gone as well
 RoboStac: but I did find I'd accidently made the network size smaller so I've restarted to make it fair
 Marchete: but according to your stats you can do near 30k sims/50ms?
 Marchete: that's way faster than I can achieve
 Marchete: 3x faster with much bigger net
 RoboStac: that's just nn speed though (using 1 gamestate and predicting as fast as possible, no mcts)
 RoboStac: it tends to be around 20-25k per turn in reality
 struct: you seem to get 1st again
 Marchete: ahh ok
 struct: might not be bugged
 Marchete: even with that is reaaly fast&#160;:)
 Marchete: aaaaaaa
 RoboStac: yeah, the occasional wins against msmits help a lot to make up for the extra losses
 RoboStac: think it's just less accurate rather than overflowing though
 struct: still I never won so many games vs you
 struct: might be luck on my side though
 stef06: hey all
 Marchete: sometimes when stars, weights and cpuct align I can win a couple
 struct: ill resubmit to climb up a bit
 RoboStac: I can easily switch back&#160;:)
 struct: true
 RoboStac: going to leave it and try the 8bit version once it's had more training time tommorow though
 struct: still a massive improvement from the old NN you had when I joined c4
 RoboStac: only about 30x as many moves checked per turn&#160;:)
 struct: makes sense
 struct: my ai with 5ms was around 3-4 ranks lower
 RoboStac: convolution looks really good but is so slow on cpu 
 Marchete: I flattened it
 Marchete: not that slow
 Marchete: as originally thought
 Marchete: but maybe not worth it vs a faster dense?
 RoboStac: doesn't seem to be
 Marchete: in c4 you tried both pure Dense and Conv?
 RoboStac: yeah
 Marchete: do you pit them?
 Marchete: just as a curiosity :D
 RoboStac: no
 Marchete: so Conv2d was better?
 RoboStac: dense does much better on the leaderboard
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: bummer
 RoboStac: I think the same number of iterations conv would be better
 Marchete: my bot is very sensitive to mcts iterations
 Marchete: it's noticeable
 RoboStac: especially on c4 when the endgame is a lot about solving number of moves left it struggled
 Marchete:&#160;:(
 struct: the problem of my bot is that is very bad early game
 Marchete: I wanted to try Conv, I just finished the layer definition and worked good
 RoboStac: I've still got conv as better in breakthrough and yavalath
 struct: I dont think NNs face this problem
 struct: isnt endgame also important on breakthrough?
 RoboStac: yes, but it's endgame in a pattern around your best pawn 
 struct: actually I remembered the paper I read and I remember end game is not that important
 RoboStac: in c4 you win by making moves in entirely random places that don't lose until the opponent is forced to play where he'll lose
 struct: game is decided early actually
 Marchete: I wouldn't say random
 Marchete: as it can be solved
 Marchete: with enough time
 MSmits: workin on it. 72 million nodes and 6GB so far 
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: Robo is right that with a 1 or 7 start, there are no winning moves, only draws and losses
 MSmits: so you do indeed wait for someone to make a mistake
 MSmits: but there are a lot more mistakes than draws
 struct: is 0 8 proven loss?
 MSmits: I have 4.5 million games in that and it's at 32%
 MSmits: WR
 MSmits: seems pretty certain to be a loss, but not proven no
 MSmits: 5 is best counter
 MSmits: (to 0)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef0820b9-70d2-4ded-8ca1-31b8f6ee95fb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef0820b9-70d2-4ded-8ca1-31b8f6ee95fb</a>
 MSmits: i maybe need to fix my exploration parameter so that it makes more visits in initially bad moves
 MSmits: still though, a visit is an entire game played as on CG. So 4.5 million is a lot
 struct: each visit is 1 solved node?
 struct: or is just the expanded nodes?
 MSmits: 1 visit is 1 new node made from a node thats not yet fully expanded
 MSmits: sometimes that new node is an immediate solve when a game is run, sometimes it doesnt solve
 MSmits: so the tree stops at nodes that are immediately solved when a game is played from there
 MSmits: for wins/losses it's around depth 30 or so
 MSmits: for draws much deeper
 MSmits: 40/45 
 MSmits: so that makes it quite hard to solve, as it seems to be solving towards a draw
 MSmits: I think if i went full focus on move 3 and pretended this game had no steal, I could solve it
 MSmits: but that doesnt help my book any :P
 yes420: Does anyone know how to stop the min command from reporting errors, since right now I have a program that includes using the min command to find the lowest number in a list, but when the list is empty, the min command just stops the code, which I don't want
 WhaIe: @yes420 if you're talking about python, you can add an argument default=X. For example, min([], default=0) will return 0
 shaurya_123: hi anybody online
 FrancoisBaveye: Nope

 eulerscheZahl: interesting read @JBMespecially the parts prior to my own activity on CG, how the system was back then
 Allis: How long have you been the best?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dbdr.github.io/cg/podium">https://dbdr.github.io/cg/podium</a>ask dbdr to update this then we know
 eulerscheZahl: at some point CG changed their ranking formulas. with the old one i would still be far away
 Allis: Interesting.
 Allis: Are some categories weighted more heavily than others?
 eulerscheZahl: and contest points decay over time now. back then you still profited from a good rank on a contest with many players 2 years prior
 Gorbit99: cp calculations are mentioned somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: questionmark at your rank on the profile page/start page
 Gorbit99: yeah
 Gorbit99: and cp under that
 aCat: morning&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 aCat: hmm results are stable I see&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: results for what?
 aCat: Illedan contest&#160;;]_
 aCat: I've been watching you talking whole vening
 aCat: *evening
 eulerscheZahl: i'm around 147500, just haven't submitted
 aCat: Yeah, some of next contributions have to be multi/opti for sure
 aCat: watching you guys having fun is fun&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: you are free to join
 aCat: I know
 aCat: I will
 aCat: probably when I will provide enough content for the course that I won't be in fear of deadlines 
 aCat: I will start making the content myself&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: i think we need a sokoban, maybe as a puzzle. too classic not to have it
 aCat: definitely start with marslander :smile_cat:
 aCat: yes
 aCat: sokoban is in my plans for sure
 eulerscheZahl: was about to call dips on it&#160;:(
 aCat: I can send you a picture of the games / problems ai noted to add on CG ;p
 eulerscheZahl: cool, go ahead and send it
 aCat: actually I have about 3 such lists, overlapping for sure
 aCat: not to mention projects aimed to be foll contest-ready multis
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like you have more ideas than time to implement them
 aCat: my usual issue in nearly every domain :crying_cat_face:
 aCat: OK, I've sent them :joy_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, will have a look
 eulerscheZahl: your handwriting though. for some i can't even tell if it's English or Polish :D
 eulerscheZahl: but some are readable, especially on your last picture
 aCat: I have the same issue :P
 aCat: first is the newet list - sokoban there  missle right column :D
 eulerscheZahl: yes, I saw that
 eulerscheZahl: did you plan it as a puzzle or optim?
 aCat: probably optim
 aCat: but thet's problematic
 aCat: as usually the problem with hardcore sokobaning is not the quality of solution
 aCat: but to solve the level at all
 aCat: so these means &lt; 100% passed
 eulerscheZahl: i agree. wrote a solver once. either it failed of found the shortest solution
 aCat: but that's the issue to resolve in a future
 eulerscheZahl: gets tricky with more boxes involved. then i might be stronger playing it by hand
 Momynul_Islam: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/38802455-0f9d-4d8e-9a50-4ad094aea5f4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/38802455-0f9d-4d8e-9a50-4ad094aea5f4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Momynul_Islam remove the GAME OVER line
 jrke: and "bingo" also not needed
 eulerscheZahl: for a moment it made me think it was a code for this puzzle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bingo">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bingo</a>
 jrke: its power of thor right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Westicles: A good sokoban puzzle would be designing the longest level giving a set of walls.  Like this
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://sokoban-gild.com/">http://sokoban-gild.com/</a>
 aCat: I have to write it down,. might be nice idea
 aCat: ahh let us allow multiauthored contributions - I have feeling that some of my nonstandard ideas euler will like :P
 eulerscheZahl: interesting idea. but needs a highly optimized solver to do the scoring
 eulerscheZahl: then referee can timeout too, not just the user code
 dbdr: I don't think it's necessarily bad if levels are hard to solve rather than hard to optimize
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested having multiple authors long ago. when the SDK was still not public but about to be released
 eulerscheZahl: hard to solve =&gt; makes a good puzzle I think
 eulerscheZahl: not an optim
 eulerscheZahl: same as for Space Maze
 dbdr: NS is a great optim
 dbdr: generated a lot of activity and research
 jrke: dbdr is your bot hardcoded in samegame?
 eulerscheZahl: so you suggest doing the same for sokoban? that might be an idea
 eulerscheZahl: solve the most levels
 dbdr: jrke: offline search, of course
 aCat: dbdr NS?
 dbdr: possibly, with harder and harder sokoban levels
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/number-shifting">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/number-shifting</a>
 dbdr: but I was also responding to your conversation
 eulerscheZahl: that could work, valuable contribution
 aCat: ah yeah, Ive seen it, really cool contrib&#160;;]
 dbdr: actually what could be an issue if it's "easy" to get the optimal, several tied #1
 aCat: ok, you get my hyped to check off the list next puzzle I'm working on&#160;;]
 aCat: breakfast, then cooking, then code ^^'
 eulerscheZahl: i'll play soccer
 dbdr: in this heat??
 eulerscheZahl: every sunday if possible
 eulerscheZahl: lockdown was a hard time for us
 jrke: yeah!! lockdown was too much...
 eulerscheZahl: we play at almost all weather. snow, heat, rain
 dbdr: in the ice storm I got yesterday, I guarantee you would have stopped :D
 eulerscheZahl: ice storm? are you kidding?
 eulerscheZahl: it's august
 dbdr: Hail - Hagel
 dbdr: it happens more when it's hot
 jrke: dunno what yesterday was independence day for india&#160;:) a kite flying day
 eulerscheZahl: saw a heavy one as a child, maybe 20 years ago
 dbdr: ice balls the size of peas falling hard, covering the ground
 Momynul_Islam: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d752bb1-e8a0-4149-bab2-d8eae80e223b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d752bb1-e8a0-4149-bab2-d8eae80e223b</a>
 eulerscheZahl: even shattered the roof gutter
 dbdr: was very impressive to watch
 eulerscheZahl: bigger than peas, more like chessnuts
 dbdr: wow, that would seriously hurt
 eulerscheZahl: i was glad i was inside
 dbdr: big kinetic energy
 eulerscheZahl: Momynul_Islam i already told you what's wrong with your code
 Momynul_Islam: i don't know
 Momynul_Islam: tell me
 Momynul_Islam: can u fix it
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl  08:46AMMomynul_Islam remove the GAME OVER line
 Momynul_Islam: give me your code
 aCat: noone will give you his code

 aCat: you can watch other people's solutions under the solutions tab
 Momynul_Islam: i remove the game over line 
 Momynul_Islam: but it still not working
 Momynul_Islam:&#160;??
 Momynul_Islam: @eulerscheZahl
 tutubalin: hello
 Marchete: I've read past chats. euler, no, please, no more sokobans, I hate this game. I think it's from an old CGA sokoban game in PC, I just can't stand it. There are more games to implement, we already have one (Bender)
 tutubalin: game viewer uses PixiJS, but docs say we need to use Java for that. How does it convert to JS? Can we use all the features of PixiJS, like filters for example?
 Marchete: java for backend, PixiJS as frontend
 tutubalin: but how they are bound?
 Marchete: the real game is the referee in java
 DaNinja: Momynul_Islam  your N and S are wrong
 tutubalin: Marchete 
 dbdr: sokoban on CG with the 4-color CGA pink palette, that's an idea!
 Marchete: this
 dbdr: but unironically
 Thyl: Hello World
 dbdr: hi
 tutubalin: so we create a sprite on Java side. does it generate PixiJS code as result? Or how it works?
 Marchete: well, that's a predefined way to do it
 Marchete: like a CG framework
 Thyl: hi dbdr
 Marchete: you can tweak it to show different stuff
 Marchete: check contributions, there are two of them that shows different stuff
 Marchete: a 3D teapot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2</a>
 Marchete: you can download the game source to see how it's done
 Marchete: and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5326e0ad9aaa1c84010096f697c2dc81eee2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5326e0ad9aaa1c84010096f697c2dc81eee2</a>
 Marchete: a different one :D
 Momynul_Islam: DaNinja thanks bro
 Marchete: or  example games <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/example-games">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/example-games</a>
 eulerscheZahl: was afk. I agree Marchete: sokoban has similarities with existing games on CG (e.g. Bender and Space Maze)
 eulerscheZahl: tutubalin the CG SDK works the following:you write java code to create objects (rectangles, images, ...)that gets serialized to a json string.the SDK also provides JS code to deserialize it and create pixi objects from it
 dbdr: (08:25:51 AM) eulerscheZahl: i think we need a sokoban, maybe as a puzzle. too classic not to have it
 eulerscheZahl: let's make a sokoban poll then
 dbdr: you will vote on both sides?&#160;;)
 Gorbit99: so when is pool getting made?
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible to get around the SDK and create your own pixi objects or doing entirely without pixi
 eulerscheZahl: you can also do parts on your own while using the SDK for others
 dbdr: where's the pool? I wanna swimm
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure about sokoban. cool game but will it be popular here?
 Gorbit99: probably depends a lot on how much people have to wait for the fall contest
 eulerscheZahl: space maze was a lot of work for 3 users to solve it and some more to at least look into it
 eulerscheZahl: not counting myself in for the 3 solvers
 dbdr: there are so many puzzles
 dbdr: less visibility than optims and multis
 eulerscheZahl: my own game passed the thibaud review to become a contest
 eulerscheZahl: next step: convince jupoulton
 dbdr: well done!
 aCat: the one I've seen eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: y
 eulerscheZahl: i'll need testers if it gets approved. i'll get back to you (plural) then if it happens
 aCat: ok, so I have to sit to this one for real so I can provide you good feedback
 aCat: and schedule some talk
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to. but would be nice&#160;:)
 aCat: as I have some comments on this one :smirk_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: i won't rebuild the whole engine :P
 aCat: I was hoping so&#160;;-)
 aCat: noo, but definitely have to work on ending condition
 eulerscheZahl: we won't discuss this here
 aCat: match eas resolved much earlier than the game really ends
 aCat: I'm talking in generals
 aCat: but ok, true :D
 dbdr: let's extract information about this contest, bit by bit, validator style&#160;;)
 aCat: I would just say
 aCat: that I LOVE THE TITLE
 aCat: naming is just first-class
 aCat: and no more spoilers from this cat
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 dbdr: thanks, all the information I needed&#160;;)
 DaNinja: I enjoyed Space Jam even though I  still havent got 100%
 DaNinja: but still hoping Space Jam episode 2 gets published  some day
 jrke: recolored are random or can be hardcoded
 Gorbit99: afaik they are actually just one of the previous cases, but recolored
 jrke: ya but are colored are changed every time or they are hardcoded maps
 dbdr: hardcoded
 MSmits: good morning guys. Managed to get transpositions working last nice
 MSmits: night
 dbdr: nice
 MSmits: solves 14 moves before the end now as opposed to 4. Quite nice. I also wasn't able to solve any of the   testcases in the IDE before
 dbdr: how much effect?
 MSmits: now I can solve all except the codingame one and the official testcases
 MSmits: dont think it had much effect on my scores though. But it saves time if anything
 MSmits: still didn't use zobrist btw. I went with a uint64[15] bitboard for the map and xorshfited each line and the gamescore up to that point into a hash
 jrke: why is this im getting 50% in real ide and 100% in contibution ide with same code
 MSmits: check which testcases fail
 MSmits: its probably recoloring
 MSmits: each official testcase is a validator but acat also recolored them and added them
 MSmits: kinda redundant, but you have to take it into account
 jrke: if recoloring then it should get 50% in contribution ide also
 MSmits: did you hard code solutions jrke?
 jrke: yes
 dbdr: contriibution might have different testcases
 MSmits: did you take into account recoloring jrke?
 dbdr: yay, I'm improving my case 7 score. was one of my weak points
 jrke: i have just hardcoded all test cases in contribution ide
 MSmits: then it's recoloring
 MSmits: wait did you hardcode 40 cases?
 jrke: ok thanks will work on it
 jrke: not 40 just 20 and made it for 2 cases
 MSmits: ah
 jrke: will add something for recoloring 
 MSmits: btw, what I did for recoloring is use my own colors. The first time a color appears it is assigned a color
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: that way it doesnt matter what the game tells me the color is, only the order matters
 jrke: nice
 AKHILASREE.M: :innocent:
 AKHILASREE.M: hi everyone i m new to this codingame.
 Allis: Is there some way of knowing what caused the notification badge on the Contribute tab?
 Gorbit99: hey there
 Allis: Or does it just signify "something got updated" and it's up to the user to find out what?
 Gorbit99: it has a new over the thing that updated
 Gorbit99: it just bugs sometimes imo
 jacek: i feel followed
 Marchete: :eyes:
 jrke: MSmits thanks now 100%
 YurkovAS: 60k in samegame with MC (online). 80k with small improved MC
 MSmits: gj jrke
 MSmits: YurkovAS I got 112k online with MCTS
 MSmits: probably could have gotten somewhat higher with submit spam
 YurkovAS: MSmits thanks. i'm try mcts later
 YurkovAS: MSmits what algo you use in hypersonic? Can't improve beam search higher 150 place
 MSmits: it's beam search
 MSmits: but I keep all states up to ply 20-25
 MSmits: I prune very well so that I dont get so many states
 YurkovAS: What width (best states count)?
 MSmits: that's really hard to say, I do states differently from everyone else
 MSmits: a state for me is a map state
 MSmits: excluding the player
 MSmits: instead of keeping a position, i keep all possiible positions with this map state
 YurkovAS: oh, you keep all states...
 MSmits: so I have a "possible position" map
 MSmits: 1 state is actually maybe 20-30 states
 MSmits: as long as you do nothing to change the map (use a bomb, get an item etc.) it doesnt matter what route you took to your next objective
 MSmits: so I floodfill from the last change of the map
 MSmits: and only make a new state when an action is taken that changes the map
 PerpetualCocktail_6633: hello
 Parthparthu: hello
 MSmits: I have several maps, bomb maps, item maps etc and they are all 128 bit
 MSmits: I xor these together for a single state into a hash and i have an unordered set or map (forgot which)
 MSmits: for transpositions
 YurkovAS: MSmits thanks. not easy
 MSmits: no it was pretty grueling
 Darshu010: hi
 MSmits: in the end i only needed like 5 ms to make an optimum choice ignoring opponents
 MSmits: with more search time or more beam width I got no improvement
 MSmits: I was going to use the rest of the time to minimax survival/killing players, but I never got good code for that. That's probably the difference between me and the players above me
 YurkovAS: i'm try beam search in samegame with 5k-10k best states, best score = 30k. But with MC 60k. Thinking about check MC in hypersonic :thinking:
 Marchete: in hypersonic just beat kymiyuki bots, it's an auto top10
 Saptarshi: can anyone tell me how do I use loops in python in a more simpler way...like the one line if else statement
 YurkovAS: don't understand kymiyuki code
 dbdr: step 1: learn japanese
 Marchete: nobody understand :D
 Andriamanitra: @Saptarshi can you elaborate on what you mean by "simpler"?
 Andriamanitra: if we don't know what you're currently doing it's hard to know is there's a simpler way :D
 Marchete: just change simple numbers
 Marchete: like the evaluation, beam width and depth
 Marchete: it has bugs also
 dbdr: Marchete, how much CPU power are you using?&#160;:)
 Marchete: like incorrect simulation in some cases
 Marchete: 5 threads
 Marchete: but diminishing returns
 dbdr: desktop CPU?
 Marchete: yes
 dbdr: yeah, that's always dimishing
 Marchete: like 3 min -&gt; 150k
 Marchete: 1 hr -&gt; 160k
 Marchete: infinite -&gt; 165k
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: wait, you can get 150k in 3 minutes?
 Marchete: or maybe 5
 Marchete: I can't recall
 Marchete: it may be just luck
 dbdr: that's 9 seconds per case
 dbdr: less than online
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: 5 min * 5 cores
 dbdr: oh, threads
 dbdr: still, 45 seconds
 Marchete: 25 min / 20 tests 
 dbdr: well, Neum*n was saying his CPU is 4 times faster than mine
 dbdr: so I think those numbers are reasonable
 Marchete: I have an Intel core i7 8700K
 JBM: thanks eulerscheZahl, glad you liked it!
 dbdr: yep, 4.5 times faster (adding cores) :D
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-i7-5600U-vs-Intel-i7-8700K/2456vs3098">https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-i7-5600U-vs-Intel-i7-8700K/2456vs3098</a>
 dbdr: only 1.5 faster per thread
 Marchete: yeah, must be certainly faster
 Marchete: and it doesn't feel at full speed
 Marchete: when you use a laptop for CPU intensive use
 Marchete: most of them sounds like a jet
 Marchete: sound9*
 Marchete: whatever
 dbdr: it's fine. I hate noise
 dbdr: you might think of those power laptops
 dbdr: not sure what the usual term is
 dbdr: mine is rather optimized for low power/heat
 dbdr: 15W
 Marchete: mobile workstation or gaming laptops
 dbdr: right
 Marchete: but I mean normal laptops that start melting on high CPU use
 dbdr: depends what you consider normal&#160;;)
 Marchete: I had one that cried a lot while the NumberShifting rush hour
 Marchete: annoying fan sound that is noticeable and doesn't let you concentrate
 Marchete: poor soul, it took like 8 hrs for a single level
 dbdr: yes. if my fan starts up, I know something is wrong, like a CG tab wasting CPU
 SPDene: if you have some superglue, you can eliminate that fan sound :P :P 
 Marchete: I just removed the fan, problem solved!
 dbdr: using efficient software also works
 Andriamanitra: this fucking piece of shit clash can go fuck itself with a sharp object
 Andriamanitra: why would the constraints say n can be huge if none of the test cases require it
 Andriamanitra: struggled for 15 minutes to find out everyone else did it the easy way that only works for small n
 jacek: o:
 Marchete: :O
 KyawMyotun: :joy&#160;:

 eulerscheZahl: dbdr  12:38PMusing efficient software also works
 dbdr: what system settings?
 dbdr: no, fan starts when it's needed. I rather make sure cpu is not used without good reason
 eulerscheZahl: just a bad joke...
 eulerscheZahl: i removed 1 fan from my computer physically. wasn't spinning well
 eulerscheZahl: always touching some part and making a terrible sound
 eulerscheZahl: and at a position with little relevance
 dbdr: wasn't that part out of place?
 dbdr: happened to me once with a cable, but I moved the cable
 eulerscheZahl: i never figured out what exactly was wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i guess the fan wasn't perfectly centered anymore, touching its own frame
 dbdr: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: so i unplugged it
 dbdr: desktop?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, still running?
 dbdr: SG
 dbdr: Westicles passed 173K
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 MSmits: I'm still working on meta mcts. 
 Marchete: do you fixed your bug?
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: it was stupid (as usual)
 MSmits: I added transpositions. What I do in mcts, is store the childIndex of the transposed Node so it can share children with other transpositions. So if the childindex was still 0 it would check if a transposed node existed and get a new index from there. But after I set this, I didn't change the childindex variable in the function. So it was still 0. I would get all sorts of weird inconsistent maps
 MSmits: it was literally just changing childIndex to node-&gt;childindex to get the right number and all was solved
 wlesavo: how fast is checking for existence of transposed node? 
 MSmits: whats a more important question is how fast is it compared to expanding a node because if the transposed node isnt found it needs to do its own expansion
 MSmits: it's begligible basically. Because expanding a node involves doing a flood fill for every possible move from the current map
 MSmits: negligible that is
 wlesavo: oh, i see
 MSmits: my map is a uint64_t[15], to get a haskey I xor all lines together
 MSmits: then i look it up in an unordered set
 wlesavo: didn't think of that, rollouts with floodfills definetly are quite slow 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: the biggest benefit from transposition is the solving I think
 MSmits: I can solve the game 14 moves before the end now, that's online
 MSmits: so only using 50 ms I guess
 wlesavo: nice
 MSmits: dont know how it is offline, havent checked
 MSmits: if you do the horizontal lines thing and you dont have transpositions, you cant even solve on turn 1
 MSmits: I solved at turn 4 i think
 MSmits: now it's easily managed
 MSmits: ohhh I just figured out what the bar under my rank means
 MSmits: thats progress toward next rank. 
 MSmits: does anyone see a semi filled bar?
 MSmits: I see it for xp
 MSmits: I wonder if they interpolate cp or rank for this bar
 wlesavo: what bar
 MSmits: above quest bar
 MSmits: map
 MSmits: you're not guru, you should see something
 MSmits: 67 ranks to go till guru for you, but in cp terms it's probably a larger fraction of the distance between the start of grandmaster and rank 100
 wlesavo: ah i see, basically its cp on a range from previous rank to the next one, for guru it could be to top#1
 MSmits: so i wonder if they use rank or cp
 MSmits: hm yes, but it doesnt have to be cp
 MSmits: it can also be rank
 wlesavo: cp for me
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: says nothing for me. just "23rd" 
 wlesavo: hm, maybe im wrong actually
 MSmits: it's based on rank then?
 MSmits: that would be a bit misleading. You could get the sense that you're almost there, when in cp terms it could still take thousands
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/Cq24fH.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/Cq24fH.jpg</a>
 MSmits: if the junp from 101 to 100 is very big
 MSmits: stop hacking dbdr :P
 dbdr: why?
 MSmits: you're not 0th with level 255 :P
 dbdr: I meant, why stop?
 MSmits: oh, I actually don't have a good answer for that
 dbdr: :nerd:
 MSmits: :P
 dbdr: hacking has a noble meaning
 MSmits: in expert circles, not in laymans terms
 dbdr: and who are we?&#160;;)
 MSmits: dunno what you are, but I am a hacking noob
 dbdr: "A computer &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer</a>&gt; hacker is a computer expert who uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem."
 wlesavo: MSmits rank confirmed, 83.75% for me which is consistent with progress bar
 dbdr: first sentence on WP&#160;:)
 MSmits: though, I did ace my internet security class&#160;:)
 MSmits: ow if thats a hacker, then we all are
 MSmits: ah ok wlesavo thanks, mystery solved
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: I'm doing a game design class in november and a functional programming class in february
 MSmits: as  a student I mean
 dbdr: though I don't think that sentence is idea
 MSmits: might be a bit general
 dbdr: it's missing something about creativity, doing things in unexpected ways
 dbdr: wow, interesting classes!
 dbdr: are you full time working + classes, or...?
 MSmits: yeah, looking forward to the game design one. Not sure about the functional programming one, but i'l lprobabyl like that too
 wlesavo: in terms of cp its close to 77%, so a little bit missleading but does not really matter much
 MSmits: I work monday, wednesday and thursday this year, got an extra day off to study
 MSmits: paid i mean, it's a 1 day a week scholarship basically
 dbdr: I think FP is really good to know, even if you don't end up using a purely functional language
 MSmits: yeah I think so too
 dbdr: nice setup
 eulerscheZahl: the C# LINQ stuff is functional btw
 MSmits: yeah I figured that. I always wanted to become better at that
 eulerscheZahl: but there are more extreme examples like Haskell or Clojure
 dbdr: yes, most recent languages incorporate some FP ideas
 dbdr: more and more over time
 MSmits: python has a lot of it too doesnt it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: the course will use elm
 eulerscheZahl: i only know Elmo
 MSmits: but the ideas are what matters I guess
 MSmits: Elmo is an earlier version
 dbdr: and the teacher!
 MSmits: hence the Elm0
 eulerscheZahl: no, this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSYadh2xmcI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSYadh2xmcI</a>
 MSmits: lol I got that :p
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: elmo appears a lot in jokes on late night shows somehow
 MSmits: mostly because of misbehaving on times square
 dbdr: John Olliver did one with Elmo I think
 MSmits: more than one :P
 MSmits: pretty sure he did more than one on his months at the daily show alone
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11449756/john-oliver-sesame-street-lead-last-week-tonight">https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11449756/john-oliver-sesame-street-lead-last-week-tonight</a>
 MSmits: ah yeah remember that
 MSmits: lol that tucker calrlson getting upset over sesame street. That was a new level of sad...
 kovi_not_hardcode: ah, better this way
 dbdr: :D
 wlesavo: lol
 dbdr: pseudo updated on pidgin but not webchat
 dbdr: I guess reload would do it
 wlesavo: no_hardkovi
 dbdr: will someone grab the kovi username now?
 wlesavo: dbdr you are free to go :smiley:
 dbdr: i'm fine&#160;:)
 wlesavo: and ill grab dbdr :slight_smile:
 dbdr: already got a FLU
 MSmits: lol kovi really dislikes the hardcoding&#160;:)
 dbdr: oh, he got scared
 wlesavo: its like euler and coc
 kovi: was thinking about that dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: I was joking, but who knows
 kovi: and i dont expect it from you, but who knows
 kovi: yes
 AntiSquid: just make an alt, use VPN wlesavo, nobody needs to know your dirty kovi nickname stealing secret
 dbdr: I thought you created an alt, to have both a online and an offline submission
 wlesavo: AntiSquid ill steal kovi_not_hardcode  and will make a shitty submit to optims :smiley:
 kovi: not a bad idea. but i just wanted to show that may 12x point is not the worst of the hardcoders, but the best of the nonhardcoders&#160;:)
 MSmits: what I don't like about online submission is the greater luckfactor. You need to spam submit to get a better score
 dbdr: wlesavo lol
 AntiSquid: pb4's nickname was once up for grabs, took it for a few hours, nobody noticed @_@
 MSmits: evil action snoone notices are tight
 dbdr: MSrnits is free...
 MSmits: free?
 wlesavo: lol
 dbdr: even you get fooled&#160;:)
 dbdr: it is
 dbdr: I should have done it
 AntiSquid: MicroSoft right now its
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: the name
 MSmits: how is it free?
 MSmits: oh r n its
 MSmits: sneaky
 wlesavo: double lol
 dbdr: ok, I'll do it
 MSmits: no no
 Marchete: yes yes
 AntiSquid: you could get eulerscheZahI just replace L at the end with uppercase i
 wlesavo: Marсhеtе is free
 dbdr: cyrillic?
 wlesavo: yes dbdr :slight_smile:
 dbdr: they might check that. or not
 wlesavo: nah, its for sure invalid characters
 wlesavo: invalid = free
 AntiSquid: what does dbdr stand for anyway?
 dbdr: Dbdr dBdr dbDr dbdR
 MSmits: database doctor?
 MSmits: he fixes all your SQL issues
 dbdr: :scream:
 AntiSquid: using mongoDB though
 wlesavo: mystery solved
 dbdr: too much work
 dbdr: wlesavo: did you check bulls and cows scores recently?
 RJMontalvo: my peanut butter jelly bot died of over spreading&#160;:(
 MSmits: dbdr anything weird happen in B&amp;C?
 dbdr: the magic of randomized validators
 MSmits: randomization got cracked?
 dbdr: nono
 MSmits: spam submit?&gt;
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: we don't even have the referee I think
 MSmits: thats what kovi wants for samegame :p
 MSmits: if you're  not hardcoding then there is no difference between the validators being random or the bots doing random things
 MSmits: in fact the more parameters you put in your bot that you fit using submission feedback, the more your bot looks like a hardcoded bot
 scofield2: :grinning:
 dbdr: rtue
 MSmits: this is why all those NN's on boardgames always play the same moves. There really is not that much difference between a oware NN and a oware bot with a massive opening book
 MSmits: jacek's oware bot is deterministic 50 plies deep with only 1 variation. If I play the same moves each time
 dbdr: yeah, NN is just the learning mechanism
 wlesavo: oh wow, nice random dbdr :slight_smile: but i believe your lead comes from some features
 dbdr: thanks for believing in me :D
 MSmits: mmh been running 4 instances of samegame solver all day
 wlesavo: well others tried spam submit as well, there deffinetly should be some magic twist :slight_smile:
 MSmits: only 1 improvement so far
 kovi: 291? :o
 dbdr: wow, that's stagnation MSmits
 kovi: something is fishy there in b&amp;cwith (reasonaly) latest submit the first 10 had 2x304. since than i rarely got below 310
 dbdr: randomness is like that
 MSmits: yes randomness is fishy
 <b>**dbdr slaps MSmits around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: :four_leaf_clover: :fish:
 wlesavo: generation probably could be improoved in b&amp;c not much though
 dbdr: what could be improved?
 wlesavo: i think im not handling some edge cases and it is possible to generate a number with additional bull
 wlesavo: which could give an advantage, and also as we disscused number can be generated online, up to the last possible number
 jacek: b&amp;c?
 wlesavo: bulls and cows 2
 kovi: wel, 304 seems like a hard limit for my current algo (over lots of attempts), so i might be very lucky on the first few
 eulerscheZahl: i spam submitted the cows&#160;:(
 MSmits: shoulda gone with the bulls for a better rank
 eulerscheZahl: oh, didn't even notice the latest movement at the top
 kovi: and considering the spread/range (315 +/-10), dbdr is definitely much better
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: I have one 291, one 294 and one 299
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/u0gztn">https://prnt.sc/u0gztn</a>i'm nowhere near this
 dbdr: so I might have something better since you never got any, but also a lot of luck involved
 kovi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85000c79-e02b-4f1b-a418-2495b983099f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/85000c79-e02b-4f1b-a418-2495b983099f</a>
 kovi: and since than just a bit better than euler's
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl I think you knew about BrainSolver at 298
 kovi: anyway, i agree that online submit also has its problems
 dbdr: teasing me about how badly I had been beaten :D
 wlesavo: lol, yeah, remember that
 dbdr: "thanks for the motivation"&#160;;)
 kovi: especially as testcase-scores are not normalized (for zombies 1 testcase can dominate)
 MSmits: yeah hardcoding solves this somewhat, if everyone has the max score, then it no longer dominates
 dbdr: yes. but it's tricky to normalize since by definition you don't know the max possible score
 MSmits: so maybe you should make all new optims then dbdr
 MSmits: win them first, then normalize
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i saw it and forgot again
 kovi: yes, tc has relative scoring
 dbdr: ah, old age...
 wlesavo: in the case of SG offline is fine because of this standartised testset, would be fun to have more testsets like this
 dbdr: you mean other games?
 wlesavo: i mean more games yeah
 kovi: well, best would be have two scoreboard&#160;:)
 dbdr: not ... enough ... games ...
 eulerscheZahl: create one
 eulerscheZahl: or many
 dbdr: one with kovi?
 wlesavo: actually before i didn't even think someone would bother to make such a testset for a random game to benchmark different algos
 dbdr: maybe it happened organically
 kovi: not sure how many make strong attempt with hardcode. probably a dozen
 wlesavo: maybe SG is not just a random game ofc, but still
 dbdr: they just made those 20 cases for that casual js game site, no?
 dbdr: then researchers took hold of it and spent years on those 20
 dbdr: it's actually funny to see those research papers referring js-games.de :D
 kovi: oh, i was not care earlier, are the actual judges known cases?
 wlesavo: hm, maybe you right, but the point stands, its fun to compare results to the others even outside the sg, not that i have much to compare :smiley:
 dbdr: yes, I agree
 dbdr: but in other cases, we can say CG is the standard
 dbdr: I'm sure research papers will eventually refer to CG
 dbdr: kovi, the 20 cases you mean?
 kovi: westicles improved? wasnt it 172k earlier?
 wlesavo: cg constrains make perfect sence for many games, yeah
 dbdr: he did
 Marchete: research papers are like "I used distributed MCTS on a supercomputer and got 78k points"
 MSmits: i wonder if he fixed his case 9&#160;:)
 MSmits: he was convinced some scientist frauded the case score
 MSmits: i can't believe some people can do this for a living
 Marchete: and some guys with a crappy laptop are better in js-games.de
 MSmits: haha yeah
 MSmits: westicles and his crappy laptop&#160;:)
 Marchete: the supercomputer part is true
 MSmits: no i know, these guys get to use their faculty's supercomputer 
 eulerscheZahl: 78k is at least 156k on CG leaderboard. but still a waste of a supercomputer
 MSmits: they get assigned x hours of use
 eulerscheZahl: does anyone check the program before approving the time?
 MSmits: doubt it
 wlesavo: how the score is calculated on jsgames? by ten lowest score sets?
 dbdr: 10 GOTO 10
 eulerscheZahl: sum of all wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: and for CG you have to do *2
 MSmits: because of recolored cases...
 eulerscheZahl: as the cat doubled the validators for whatever reason
 MSmits: which i still think is silly
 wlesavo: oh, i see, we have 40 cases
 Marchete: I think it's the same score
 wlesavo: forgot about that
 Marchete: at least I submited Test 1 to check
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl if you consider it a regular puzzle, the recolored part would make for an exatra test, but no need to recolor all 20
 eulerscheZahl: well, it's not a puzzle :P
 MSmits: that too
 MSmits: Marchete what search type do you use btw?
 MSmits: forgot to ask
 Marchete: I ended matching the validator and returning the solution[i%20]
 Marchete: similar to Numbershifting
 Marchete: variations of SA
 MSmits: oh ok
 Marchete: maybe I'll try some MCTS algo
 MSmits: mine is really simple and does well
 MSmits: if I added more features it might be better
 Marchete: so add it
 eulerscheZahl: any fancy scoring?
 MSmits: i tried a few from the papers
 MSmits: didnt help
 MSmits: no just high score
 MSmits: i use each nodes highscore divided by parent high score in place of node value
 kovi: besides hardcoding i still havent read any papers
 MSmits: so if a child has a the max score, the node value = 1
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't read any papers either
 eulerscheZahl: too lazy
 dbdr: you hardcode kovi?
 MSmits: i read one on mcts
 kovi: bad english
 MSmits: had lot of fancy stuff that didnt work for me :P
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: the papers or you kovi_not_hardcode?
 MSmits: cuz... some papers :P
 kovi: i had lots of failed heuristics. and some working well
 MSmits: i only use one heuristic
 MSmits: tobucolor i think it is
 MSmits: in the random rollout
 MSmits: other than that its just all fairly optimized code, nothing special
 eulerscheZahl: i tried rewarding few stones without any group but meh
 MSmits: i tried node value as average score instead of high score
 MSmits: but that peformed worse as opposed to what the paper said
 wlesavo: i have a fixed order for ccolors for a single rollouts, the only one that really worked, but i guess it can be worse than tabu color
 MSmits: what do you mean fixed order?
 MSmits: do you just set an order and then do the rollout?
 eulerscheZahl: death to green
 Marchete: there are a lot of papers that use acronyms, and there is nothing more in the internet about them
 Marchete: Heuristically Guided Swarm Tree Search 
 wlesavo: if possible i try to choose first color in shuffled list of colors 
 Marchete: I've seen like zero info apart from 1 damn paper
 MSmits: maybe try different search words
 dbdr: Marchete: it's a troll paper&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and searching for "same game" isn't that simple either
 MSmits: like "Run away, this tree has bees"
 dbdr: refer to amazing results from non-existing technique / paper
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl it's like searching for breakthrough
 eulerscheZahl: yeah :D
 dbdr: always wondered about the name
 dbdr: same as what?
 eulerscheZahl: same colors
 MSmits: the cells are the same color
 MSmits: they disappear
 dbdr: ah
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: is this guy nr 1 in our optims?
 MSmits: jeez
 dbdr: rather sounds like "same game as that other game", which does not make sense
 wlesavo: MSmits yeah, basically fixed order, in case of simple MC with not a lot of rollouts it works quite ok, but generally it should be worse then tabucolor
 dbdr: yeah, dumb
 MSmits: :P
 Marchete: what algo was using W?
 Marchete: because I tend to pick the worst possible
 wlesavo: dbdr that was what i though, same old game, like the very simple game with intuitive rules, lol
 MSmits: wlesavo i am not sure, tabucolor in general gives higher score, but you also keep using the same branches
 MSmits: varying branches also has value
 MSmits: thats why i am hoping meta mcts will help a bit
 kovi: fixed order help with limited time
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thats what i was thinking, with hardcoding it may end up hurting you
 MSmits: less chances for lucky high score
 Marchete: rule of thumb, as you can work offline, always give a chance to worse options
 MSmits: good rule
 Marchete: like 90% your super algo, but 10% random
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: the mcts paper used epsilon greedy 0.0002
 MSmits: does that mean 0.02% chance to pick random?
 wlesavo: simmilar to policy convergence theorem
 wlesavo: MSmits yes
 MSmits: seems extremely low chance
 MSmits: 2 in 10k
 wlesavo: well if you have unlimited time its ok
 MSmits: they didnt though
 wlesavo: oh
 MSmits: they used a minute o rless
 MSmits: i would at least use 1% I think
 dbdr: lol
 wlesavo: or decreasing by time value
 kovi: i think fixed order hurt online as well. first day i tried dual-taboo, it sometimes helped
 dbdr: a ridiculously low random is a nice trick to be able to prove "given enough time, it will find the optimal solution"
 wlesavo: i think it depends on the range of your score :smiley:
 MSmits: ahh i remembered the wrong value
 MSmits: it's 0.3%
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d96a86a6-656d-4521-8b9e-995d0cfb96f0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d96a86a6-656d-4521-8b9e-995d0cfb96f0</a>
 Marchete: I'm not academic, but so many papers seem just fillers to me
 Marchete: like filling CV and/or goals
 MSmits: yes seems to me as well
 wlesavo:  especially in computure science yeah, but in other field as well
 MSmits: btw, about the quote from the paper just now. Do they mean chance epsilon to have the first move of the playout be different, or every move? Or have a chance for every move?
 dbdr: I think there has been pressure on academia that pushed in that direction as a perverse effect
 kovi: well...how is it different from our competition. inching for the last 0.0x% improvement to beat others&#160;:)
 dbdr: MSmits: I think every move
 MSmits: so every time you do a move in the playout, you reroll the dice?
 dbdr: the goal of academia should be to increase knowledge, and just can't quantify that in a useful way
 dbdr: if you evaluate people based on how many papers they publish, they will publish more
 MSmits: if knowledge becomes hard to find in a mountain of filler papers, it actually reduces knowledge
 dbdr: I agree
 dbdr: the evaluation policy is the problem
 MSmits: which papers are approved you mean?
 wlesavo: dbdr in russia last couple of years it went in extreme mode
 dbdr: a lot of major breakthroughs have been from people who were not able to show results for a decade or more
 Westicles: Ha, I found an old writeup of my approach. It sounds so stupid
 MSmits: I would not mind reading your stupid stuff
 wlesavo: publish it, a decade went over :slight_smile:
 Marchete: I want to hear stupid things, Westicles :ear_tone1:
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab240ea0-1cb7-4862-9584-216b943a6b38">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab240ea0-1cb7-4862-9584-216b943a6b38</a>
 MSmits: that doesn't sound stupid at all, it sounds like something I would need to think about for a day before I figure out why it works
 Westicles: I think it is just the same thing as NS
 MSmits: I never understood what you did there either, aside from it being SA
 wlesavo: i think its very close to what i tried in NS as well
 dbdr: sounds much more complicated than what I had in NS
 wlesavo: but yeah, some details are quite interesting
 MSmits: started two instances of solver for testcase 2 with epsilon 1%... see if it helps
 kovi: my solution has similar to that westicles
 MSmits: it's my worst score compared to the maximum I've found
 kovi: except the repeat million times of course as online&#160;:)
 MSmits: submit spam does that part
 wlesavo: kovi and a one minute part :slight_smile:
 kovi: i dont spam submit, just a few to get some average
 MSmits: I'm just kidding, it wont let you
 MSmits: I hate what happens on submit spam.
 MSmits: first it lets click robot thingies which is fine
 MSmits: but then it says "try again in a few minutes" FOR AN HOUR
 dbdr: imagine getting "try again in a few years"
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: on the whole account
 MSmits: I deserve that for running so much cg benchmark :P
 dbdr: you've reached your 2020 quota, try again next year
 wlesavo: right before the contest
 dbdr: :D
 wlesavo: or after submiting a broken bot
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: that actually happened to me in locam speed
 dbdr: spam?
 dbdr: or just the meltdown?
 MSmits: no i submitted a broken bot
 MSmits: but i didnt know it was broken because the feature i coded was in the next league
 MSmits: I missed one space
 MSmits: couldnt wait for submit to finish so i was just hoping it would work
 eulerscheZahl: CG will go out of business just because of smits spamming games
 MSmits: heh I dont do it as much now&#160;:) 
 MSmits: but I did some crazy amounts during my PCR testing. Thousands a week.
 dbdr: thousands of benches?
 MSmits: games
 MSmits: at most I think 8000 games in a week
 MSmits: it's mostly because PCR needs so many to get a signal out of the randomness
 dbdr: ~1 game per minute non stop for a week&#160;:)
 MSmits: sounds right yeah
 MSmits: thanks to me, codingame is ready for server load during contests :P
 kovi: i approx. did ~1 per minute latest games with pure submits
 kovi: (hundrends of submits for few weeks, 50-100 games per submit)
 MSmits: for a week non stop?
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: allright, you are worse than me
 MSmits: didn't know it was possible
 dbdr: no, that should trigger rate limiting
 eulerscheZahl: i also think there's a quota per game, isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: so you can benchmark 10 different arenas at the same time
 MSmits: yeah thats true
 dbdr: harder to analyze in your brain
 MSmits: I never misused that though
 MSmits: but could have
 kovi: but i meant submit, not bench
 MSmits: I could benchmark several boardgames at the same time if I wanted
 dbdr: oh right
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, we saw you the last contests kovi
 eulerscheZahl: also: CG has 2 queues. 1 for submit, 1 for IDE games. the IDE has higher priority
 MSmits: which is dangerous
 MSmits: with people using CG
 eulerscheZahl: that's why they added the delays when CG Spunk became popular
 eulerscheZahl: as testing users slowed down submits
 kovi: bench is better within top5, submit spam is better when not there yet
 dbdr: I think when you are far from top 5, you can usually stop something to improve without spamming
 dbdr: *spot
 kovi: my spamming is never to have better score, but to assess latest changes
 kovi: vs. other (more realistically than single submit)
 dbdr: I was not speaking about better score
 kovi: oh spot, i see
 kovi: well, yes but spotting/getting an idea is one part, checking how much that helps is another
 dbdr: yes, but knowing that precisely is not very relevant
 dbdr: it might even lead to a local maximum
 kovi: not precisely, but sometimes the result from a single submit is irrealistically good/bad
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: I guess my point is, improving the logic of a bot is more important than optimizing against a field of bots that will changes anyways
 dbdr: except near the end
 kovi: valid point
 kovi: but with limited time one has to assess current improvements to have better prioritization of further improvements
 kovi: wow, euler back to 4th
 kovi: and i still cant reach illedan
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: CEST is UTC+2, not UTC-2&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: what are you talking about?
 dbdr: joking
 dbdr: bc you submitted just above MSmits, close to 6pm CEST
 eulerscheZahl: context?
 eulerscheZahl: ah, the illedan "contest"
 eulerscheZahl: already half forgot about that again :D
 dbdr: and end is at 8pm UTC
 eulerscheZahl: chat is laggy
 dbdr: hider&#160;;)
 dbdr: very laggy
 eulerscheZahl: and i can beat smits whenever i want to
 eulerscheZahl: considering that i have the skills which i don't always have
 dbdr: that trash talk :D
 dbdr:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: considering is the wrong word
 kovi: yay, another odd score
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: easy to fake&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: let me rephrase: it's my own decision when i want to submit a solution to beat smits
 kovi: ;P
 dbdr: provided you have a higher local score
 eulerscheZahl: which i knew i had
 eulerscheZahl: but probably not higher than his local
 dbdr: that means you are improving slowly too
 dbdr: if you submitted your best
 eulerscheZahl: stuck now
 eulerscheZahl: i mean i can go up like +20
 dbdr: I thought you said you stopped
 eulerscheZahl: started the solver again
 eulerscheZahl: when i wrote it, it was true
 eulerscheZahl: but at that time i didn't have my strongest in the arena
 dbdr: dbdr askseuler stop"I stopped"euler restarts
 dbdr:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you swapped the first 2 lines
 dbdr: less funny
 eulerscheZahl: i would just lie to you rather than stopping in the middle of a search that only saves at the end
 dbdr: what's your score on case 7?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61912f94-d120-4e9d-89e6-a7ac61ffdced">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/61912f94-d120-4e9d-89e6-a7ac61ffdced</a>
 dbdr: I have 2771, definitely a weak point
 dbdr: thx
 kovi: case20 is the same as standard test20?
 eulerscheZahl: yes

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/eng/faq">http://www.js-games.de/eng/faq</a>these FAQ are nostalgic
 eulerscheZahl: When I told LX about my idea he called me crazy. "How do you want to do all the clicking stuff?" I knew it could be possible somehow but I had no concrete concept at the time.
 dbdr: what does LX mean?

 dbdr: syntax looks lispy
 MSmits: mmh first results on 1% epsilon came back, nothing spectacular yet
 MSmits: (this is an hour per run)
 dbdr: new optims should be only allowed during winter
 MSmits: agreed
 dbdr: and ban the southern hemisphere to avoid that issue
 MSmits: on the northern hemisphere ofc
 eulerscheZahl: getting warm in here too
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I've been battling mosquitos to keep the windows open here
 dbdr: watch out mosquitos sucked in by the fan and grilled on the cpu
 MSmits: this happens?
 dbdr: I guess that works as antimosquito
 dbdr: might need those fancy case lights
 MSmits: yeah lol
 Westicles: I'm very impressed my new 18c desktop isn't getting hot
 dbdr: you know the origin of the word "bug"?
 MSmits: if it's not getting hot, you still have a crappy computer Westicles :P
 eulerscheZahl: you no longer have that old laptop Westicles? :o
 MSmits: dbdr maybe it comes from bugs?
 MSmits: just riffing here
 Westicles: Nah, I couldn't resist when dazzled by all those cores.
 dbdr: frying on early computers and thus causing "bugs", yes
 MSmits: wow really
 eulerscheZahl: now dbdr officially has the worse hardware
 eulerscheZahl: together with JBM
 dbdr: yay \o/
 JBM: unexpected hl
 MSmits: you dont need good hardware to rickroll people
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 JBM: can't wait for the dbdr streams
 dbdr: because of the hardware?
 eulerscheZahl: i saw a video of him at least
 eulerscheZahl: speaking at a conference
 MSmits: dbdr?
 eulerscheZahl: y
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: I assume
 JBM: oooh now we're curious
 dbdr: dbdrconf
 JBM: doctoring satabases again?
 JBM: satabase, that's a nice typo
 dbdr: nice one
 MSmits: starbases?
 eulerscheZahl: something about a software for molucules, i don't remember
 JBM: the successor to scsibase
 eulerscheZahl: he had a molecule as a profile pic initially
 JBM: i don't remember that far
 MSmits: which one
 JBM: ethanol, most likely
 MSmits: mmh ok
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/37/df/da/37dfda943a0bff11fd79421f52a84e9f.png">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/37/df/da/37dfda943a0bff11fd79421f52a84e9f.png</a>
 MSmits: dbdrunk
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what that is
 dbdr: good memory about the profile, eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: meth obviously
 dbdr: I was a nobody at the time
 eulerscheZahl: you were the java UTTT legend
 dbdr: still with that pic?
 eulerscheZahl: i think so
 dbdr: possible
 MSmits: dbdr inspired me to stick with C# until legend
 eulerscheZahl: google image search suggests: Eminem Darkness
 MSmits: so, meth
 dbdr: Jul  7  2018 prince.png
 eulerscheZahl: long ago
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still not 100% used to it. new profile pics always confuse me
 MSmits: thats when i was working on uttt the first time
 dbdr: common, I registered end of 2017
 MSmits: so matches up
 eulerscheZahl: that's half a year as a molecule
 eulerscheZahl: long time
 dbdr: changed a few months later. now 2 years later you're not used to the new one? :D
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 eulerscheZahl: smits is more consistent

 eulerscheZahl: we had a golf cooking contest?
 dbdr: cooking was calm
 dbdr: then I focussed on golfing
 dbdr: but I had to stop that trend, was getting crowded
 MSmits: coulda added some floating numbers for NS
 eulerscheZahl: and now you are back to running through long corridors
 MSmits: and jumping, dont forget the jumping
 eulerscheZahl: and stabbing
 eulerscheZahl: that reminds me of the stabbing game we once played

 dbdr: how does it work?
 kovi: yay, got you illedan
 MSmits: kovi_not_hardcode stabbed Illedan?
 dbdr: yay!
 MSmits: :evil:
 eulerscheZahl: damn, had no stamina left
 dbdr: killed eulerscheZahl :D
 MSmits: glorious
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: :skull:
 Illedan: Try again kovi )
 Illedan:&#160;;;)
 kovi: nooo
 Illedan: :P
 dbdr: it's a bit silly
 eulerscheZahl: i got bored too :D
 dbdr: the only way to win is not to stab first :D
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 dbdr: very moral
 kovi: westicles, have you tried your code online?
 dbdr: Illedan is creepy and sneaky, we already knew that&#160;;)
 Illedan: Was hiding :D
 JBM: exactly how the face-off with mirror prince should be played
 dbdr: ^
 eulerscheZahl: are you still hiding Illedan?
 dbdr: I think he has 180k+
 JBM: if i don't stream fp tonight, i'll speedrun pop
 Illedan: Going to be glorious
 dbdr: porque no los dos?
 JBM: because pop doesn't qualify as fp?
 dbdr: doesn't prevent you from doing both
 Westicles: kovi, no it would be too slow. 
 JBM: true
 dbdr: bonus points for doing them at the same time
 JBM: lol
 JBM: well a pop-bot oughtn't be that hard
 JBM: in the grand scheme of gameplaying bots
 dbdr: hard coded or learning?
 kovi: what is the best for test20?
 eulerscheZahl: did you see the link i shared after you asked about test 20?
 dbdr: ‏‎5265

 kovi: oh, i cand yours?
 eulerscheZahl: there seems to be an unpublished paper having higher scores
 eulerscheZahl: btw sampson is first here on CG
 eulerscheZahl: mine:

 eulerscheZahl: + means i cleared the board
 dbdr: it's published, MSmits linked to it
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: hmm not exactly
 MSmits: the paper i linked is published
 Westicles: oh really, the new one from Tristan?  Does it give scores?
 MSmits: but it has references to other research that is unverified
 MSmits: not sure if it is published
 dbdr: so there is a published paper with scores from possibly unpublished papers&#160;:)
 kovi: interesting. i have tried locally and got to 4700 on 1st run (3 minutes)
 kovi: must be lucky
 dbdr: or diminishing returns
 MSmits: which testcase kovi_not_hardcode?
 kovi: case20
 MSmits: thats higher than mine
 MSmits: 4503
 Illedan: 3887 :D
 MSmits: max from sources is 5265
 dbdr: js.de has that
 MSmits: then that might be the source
 Westicles: Oh, that one.  Pah
 kovi: nvm. was a lucky run
 wlesavo: easy 2107 :smiley:
 kovi: wow, 4900 now
 eulerscheZahl: you should start hardcoding
 kovi: what is yours westicles?
 Westicles: yeah, 16-20 are the best to make you feel good.  65 of one color
 Westicles: 5239 for 20
 kovi: true. others are more "pure luck"
 Westicles: 1-10 are random, 11-15 45 each color
 kovi: well i cant tell the range, just 1,5,10,15,20&#160;:)
 Westicles: 4900 is good, you should play it out on jsgames
 Westicles: Oh, I see... you don't know your move list I guess
 dbdr: do you have a scrpt for that Westicles?
 kovi: you did with 5239?
 kovi: you have the point, i didnt record&#160;:)
 kovi: the movelist
 Westicles: No script... remember, I was the guy who couldn't figure out the python script on NS
 dbdr: :D
 kovi: balanced games are not that funi guess i could battle for 2nd place on hardcoding
 dbdr: why not #1?
 kovi: i can only compare a few score with eulers, and from that i interpolate
 eulerscheZahl: you can try the other too kovi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/847363c996b5db478bdbf6bf192c2535825e84">https://www.codingame.com/demo/847363c996b5db478bdbf6bf192c2535825e84</a>
 kovi: i mean, those few are enough to assess that im consistently 10% above
 kovi: (or can be)
 kovi: but yeah, that is just with repeated longer runs. with more time additional code/heuristics can be added
 Marchete: no more improvement for hours, I think I'm done with it
 eulerscheZahl: i did a massive improvement on testcase 1
 eulerscheZahl: took 2h to find it
 aCat: so close 4, 5, 6

 eulerscheZahl: maybe later
 aCat: ok

 Tuntraek: Hi, I'm having trouble with the native editor, ctrl+c, ctrl+v, etc are not working and Idk why, anyone got an idea why?
 eulerscheZahl: VIM mode?
 eulerscheZahl: left side: settingswhat's your edit mode?
 Tuntraek: ok, lemme see that..
 Tuntraek: yeah, it was emacs
 eulerscheZahl: then i was close at least :D
 Tuntraek: yeap, that fix it... lol thanks!
 Tuntraek: btw, what are the copy, cut, paste shortcuts in emacs or vim?
 eulerscheZahl: that's a google question if no one else steps in. no idea
 dbdr: vim: v to select, y to copy, p to paste
 eulerscheZahl: select what? all?
 dbdr: shift-v to select lines, ctrl-v to select rectangles
 dbdr: v to movement
 dbdr: v + movement
 Tuntraek: thanks!
 dbdr: vw selects a word, for instance&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: gg vG is select all then?

 Scarfield: usually wednesday i think
 IfIHadATail: seems legit
 IfIHadATail: lol okay thanks&#160;: )
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 jacek: a month, weekfield?
 Andriamanitra: why must reverse mode exist
 Andriamanitra: half of these are just "guess what operation i decided to do with ascii values of characters this time"
 Scarfield: yescek, was quality joke
 kovi: yay
 wlesavo: nice kovi
 kovi: and pretty stably above 125k now
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Andriamanitra: is there any enforcement against cheating in clash?
 Andriamanitra: some guy submitted 100% in 25 seconds and this was a clash that i think most of us couldn't complete even in the full 15 minutes with all the edge cases
 Andriamanitra: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13401038fea405615af59b5ab49062aead56148">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13401038fea405615af59b5ab49062aead56148</a>
 Andriamanitra: incredibly frustrating problem too this oracle thing
 reCurse: No rule against copy/pasting your previous attempt
 JaggBow: Can you get the same problem twice in CoC?
 reCurse: Yes
 kovi: lovely speedups
 Sintex: not proud of that one, but it passed the tests lol
 MSmits: Andriamanitra it's not really cheating
 MSmits: ah chat scroll
 Andriamanitra: if that's not cheating i have no idea what is
 Andriamanitra: i guess hacking the whole system might count, or maybe there's also technically no rule against that :grinning:
 darkhorse64: TBali is a human bot
 Andriamanitra: even if you've solved it before there's no way you dig up the answer manually in under 25 seconds so you can drop the human part
 darkhorse64: I am a noob in CoC but I have already solved one in less of 25 seconds
 Andriamanitra: i have too
 Andriamanitra: but that's not one you solve in under a minute
 darkhorse64: *less than*
 TBali: Hi, yes that was a copy paste of my previous solution. First attempt was of course much longer for this one, but well within the 15 min limit.
 TBali: I did not know if it is against the rules. 
 TBali: I am currently go for the 500 CoC achievement so Coc-ing a lot. 
 darkhorse64: A good memory is a very powerful weapon
 TBali: I hate to solve same things twice, so if it repeats  I copy my old solution
 Andriamanitra: goes a bit against the spirit of the game in my opinion
 Andriamanitra: when i get repeats i might solve it in a different language or something
 TBali: After each CoC I save my solution to a big fille together with the first input/output pair
 darkhorse64: :popcorn:
 TBali: Okay I understand your point, and I don't wnat to ruin anybody's experience.
 TBali: However if I meet a CoC I have the solution what shall I do? Wait artificially before submit?
 Scarfield: new rule: Must wait 10min before copy pasting :p
 Scarfield: what happens if you leave a CoC? just to avoid the grey area of cheating
 darkhorse64: I played one CoC against you TBali: you output before i finished reading the statement
 darkhorse64: :sob:
 MSmits: well at least it wasnt your slow typing
 MSmits: :p
 darkhorse64: slow mind
 TBali: Sometimes I met with some guys from the top of leaderboard. They are indeed fast...
 TBali: plus they are also short (mostly in Ruby) . In PHP I am getting better and better in golf, but ruby still beats me most of the time.
 peppece: how do some ppl type so fast
 Andriamanitra: i've played against the top3 multiple times and while they're fast it never feels unfair because they still take the time to write the code (even though i'm sure they've seen most clashes before)
 darkhorse64: They press the right keys
 Scarfield: with more than 2 fingers :p'
 peppece: do clashes repeat often?
 TBali: it  depends how much you play&#160;:-)
 TBali: There is a limited number CoC puzzles in the pool.
 peppece: oh k
 TBali: I am at 350 and now it repeats a LOT
 Andriamanitra: i have a bit over 500 clashes and i've not had too many repeats yet, maybe a few dozen
 TBali: that's strange
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm at 1238, I get a fair number of repeats
 peppece: one of u must be wrong lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: not necessarily 
 peppece: how so?
 Kuzey: mods someone copied code from the internet on clash
 BenjaminUrquhart: the clashes you get depend on your opponents' ranking in CoC and a bit of randomness
 peppece: ah i get it
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you keep getting newer players in your lobbies you'll see a lot of the easier ones
 peppece: right so if u get stronger peopl everytime u keep seeing new ones
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes, the "harder" ones
 peppece: kk
 Andriamanitra: i guess tbali is getting only the hard ones since he's high level
 Scarfield: hmm, i get some failed tests when submitting Same Game, but cant seem to fail a testcase?
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh if we're talking about level, I'm at 238 for clashes
 peppece: just out of curiosity
 peppece: do people really get a job out of this site
 TBali: Not sure about hard ones, I get one-liners as well
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah yes the ones you solve in under 10 seconds
 TBali: the one you quoted was one of the longest  solutions I had in CoC.
 TBali: pretty annoying edges cases, i remember
 BenjaminUrquhart: which one was quoted?
 TBali: scroll up to a link
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's out of my history
 BenjaminUrquhart: I opened an IDE window
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13401038fea405615af59b5ab49062aead56148">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/13401038fea405615af59b5ab49062aead56148</a>incredibly frustrating problem too this oracle thing
 Scarfield: the link ^
 BenjaminUrquhart: that doesn't tell me what the prompt is
 BenjaminUrquhart: and I can't see solutions since I wasn't a participant
 Scarfield: well, i scrolled up to a link 
 BenjaminUrquhart: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4982f173dce367ca6a5cbc810907bb085189">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4982f173dce367ca6a5cbc810907bb085189</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: only result for oracle in clash
 Allis: That's the one.
 Allis: Hilarious that TBali submitted in 21 seconds,  but I'm glad he's honest about the fact that he pastes previous solutions.
 BenjaminUrquhart: I also do that for annoying ones 
 BenjaminUrquhart: :upside_down:
 Allis: I think it's poor sportsmanship, but obviously I understand not wanting to solve it again.
 BenjaminUrquhart: this one seems fairly simple to me
 BenjaminUrquhart: except I can't test it for some reason
 Allis: Pretty much all of the ones that don't require some physics knowledge are "fairly simple". Speed is usually the name of the game.
 Andriamanitra: it doesn't seem too bad until you look at the test cases
 Allis: And if you're pasting a previous solution, well, you're kinda starting the race at the finish line?
 BenjaminUrquhart: the point is to have fun, are you really having fun by recoding something you didn't enjoy the first time around?
 BenjaminUrquhart: but I see what you're saying
 BenjaminUrquhart: "Couldn't find the question related to this contribution".
 BenjaminUrquhart: no u
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's just a bunch of if-statements looking at the validators
 Allis: There's a way to be clever about it that doesn't involve much special-casing.
 BenjaminUrquhart: the sample solution is simple at least
 TBali: I think the shortest I got was: echo (($n * $n - $n) / 2) . "\n"
 Allis: On that note, it seems like it'd be a nice feature to allow multiple solution languages.
 TBali: or something like that
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 Andriamanitra: it's almost like the author knew of all the traps he deliberately planted
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok give me an example
 Andriamanitra: like spaces before "?", abbreviated words that end in ".", question words that have 's after them
 Andriamanitra: .split is rendered useless
 Allis: Thankfully, Ruby copied a whole bunch of Perl's regex craziness.
 BenjaminUrquhart: .split("('s)? ")
 BenjaminUrquhart: (I use a lang with regex splitting)
 Allis: As do I, but I'm not sure I see how it helps?
 Allis: Splitting at all is definitely a trap for that one.
 BenjaminUrquhart: removes the 's from words that end with it since it's a conditional part of the split regex
 Andriamanitra: it helps for the question mark thing but then you need to be careful not to use the same thing for finding out if the last letter is a vowel 
 Andriamanitra: question word thing *
 BenjaminUrquhart: the question mark is easy, not sure why the spaces are a trap
 BenjaminUrquhart: last char of string == '?'
 MSmits: It's a trap!
 BenjaminUrquhart: hi are you still doing yavalath
 MSmits: not currently, why do you ask?
 BenjaminUrquhart: curious
 MSmits: not much to do there atm
 Andriamanitra: because you can't count the number of words ending in consonant by doing words.size - vocal_word_count
 MSmits: If i get opposition, I will go back
 BenjaminUrquhart: 4 points ahead I see
 BenjaminUrquhart: understandable have a nice day
 MSmits: you too , going to bed soon btw, not much day left. Also, work tomorrow&#160;:(
 MSmits: been 6 weeks off, always sucks the first few days
 BenjaminUrquhart: Andriamanitra that's not really a hurdle though? It's one of those things you try, see it doesn't work, and move on to counting consonants the long way
 BenjaminUrquhart: I haven't done anything on the site since pacman challenge 
 Andriamanitra: well it's a hurdle you can manage but hurdle nonetheless
 BenjaminUrquhart: fair enough
 BenjaminUrquhart: gonna play a few rounds to see if I'm completely wrong and the puzzle quality has changed a lot since I last came
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh hi
 Andriamanitra: i feel like i've had terrible puzzles the last couple days
 Andriamanitra: but maybe i'm just imagining it
 BenjaminUrquhart: well there's that CoC footer now
 BenjaminUrquhart: annoying smh
 reCurse: I don't think anyone takes clashes seriously enough to care about enforcing rules especially when it's something you solved before

 HDnox: Hi everyone, check out my first clash of code contribution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/646737f6fdf43cc4dbc996978c2803164897">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/646737f6fdf43cc4dbc996978c2803164897</a>
 thienduc: hello
 Huy123: moring
 Ordonnateur: is there a way to know value of validator&#160;? (on a puzzle I get all test green but one validator don't want to work, I checked some other similar case (validator name compared to test name) and everything was working so I don't understand what I didn't check &gt;&lt;')
 GlowKid: I don't think so.
 Ordonnateur: How some people give some of them in discussion so&#160;?
 KiwiTae: try random answers until u pass the validator then u know whats the validator
 Ordonnateur: Hum... that's a possibility ^^'. I was hoping something like git or somewhere in codingame website. quite sad I won't really be able to know what's wrong with my code ^^'
 Illedan: Which puzzle?
 Ordonnateur: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/test-before-validate">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/test-before-validate</a>!
 Illedan: Which validator?
 Ordonnateur: last validator don't want to work but I pass the last test whatever the 'authorized' action is placed in the action tab
 Ordonnateur: wherever*
 Ordonnateur: (when the place change, the test is false yes but the logic is right*)
 magaiti: test before validate, yeah, afair you have to make sure your action's order is preserved unless precedence dictates otherwise
 Ordonnateur: My issue was that I didn't managed the case where 1 value had 2 before/after (in that case I was loopind indefinitly &gt;&lt;')
 Ordonnateur: I'm changing my approach now, Maybe it will work maybe it will be a dead end too xd
 magaiti: probably you are checking bot before an after for each action; you only need to check one or the other
 magaiti: 'cause every before is an after, just swapped
 Ordonnateur: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d01e5e84-5198-4775-8d5e-89ed34f49af3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d01e5e84-5198-4775-8d5e-89ed34f49af3</a>
 Ordonnateur: :o using maj+enter create a pastebin&#160;? didn't knew xd
 Ordonnateur: (and it's an 404 error jesus lol)
 Ordonnateur: What I said was =&gt; I currently manage "attack before kill/select before attack" but not "attack before damage/ attack before kill". I already swap after into before&#160;:)
 magaiti: ah well maybe your code can't manage to store multiple precedences for an action
 Ordonnateur: yes&#160;:)
 Ordonnateur: (all test didn't had to manage it so I thought validator will too, but sadly not xd)
 magaiti: well then
 magaiti: just do it

 Ordonnateur: I will, I will, let me the time :joy:
 jacek: you did time?
 Illedan: Anyone knows some good research on depths a search can handle given it's search space?
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: bit vague, aren't all search algos well researched?
 davilla: I don't know about research, but if you're looking for an explanation this one is pretty good:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/STjW3eH0Cik">https://youtu.be/STjW3eH0Cik</a>
 AntiSquid: minimax isn't that great now is it? 
 AntiSquid: for depth
 AntiSquid: MCTS / Beam Search are better 
 davilla: he talks about those other algorithms in earlier lectures, but I remember this one specifically discussing how to handle depth
 AntiSquid: ever tried random forest, it handles any "depth" :P
 LionMask: hello
 jacek: i bet he also meant dfs, bfs, and their 'reasonable' depth given hardware
 jacek: and minimax is so last week. i think now i dont have any bot implemented in minimax here
 AntiSquid: it's slow isn't it&#160;?&#160;:/what do you generally use&#160;? apart from n-tuple something
 Illedan: n-tuple?
 AntiSquid: i asked first, don't distract him :P
 Its_rohit: hiiii
 AntiSquid: woah you upgraded your greeting?
 davilla: By random forest you mean the learning algorithm? (I'm reading about it on Wikipedia.)
 AntiSquid: oh damn i mistook this guy with jacek <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57040ef9d73fbf30662196ce282f3316d2cf">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57040ef9d73fbf30662196ce282f3316d2cf</a> , they all look the same

 AntiSquid: davilla <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests">https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests</a>, maybe do decision tree first
 AntiSquid: it's not the most accurate model but can handle anything
 AntiSquid: it's like generating best if else branching given enough time :D
 davilla: interesting, thanks

 LionMask: play easy puzzles
 LionMask: Tiffion
 LionMask: testcase=input()for i in range(int(testcase)):
 LionMask: IN STUB GENERATOR INPUT
 LionMask: plz any body help me
 AntiSquid: i meant the contribution
 LionMask: okk
 LionMask: can u help ,e
 AntiSquid: your stub i think needs changing
 LionMask: me
 AntiSquid: no
 LionMask: why
 AntiSquid: no time today for sure
 AntiSquid: maybe wednesday will see
 LionMask: read testcase:string(20)
 LionMask: but i don't understand for loop
 LionMask: what is your contribution name AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: when you edit your contribution there is a question mark for each section
 AntiSquid: if you click the one for the stub i think you should get some general idea of how to write a stub
 AntiSquid: or check other contributions for comparison
 LionMask: yeah but i don't understand that
 AntiSquid: just the loop&#160;?
 LionMask: loop 
 AntiSquid: i will explain mine
 Ordonnateur: some one know how to get all possible array from an  array&#160;? ([1,2,3] =&gt;[[1,2,3],[3,1,2],[2,3,1],[3,2,1],[1,3,2],[2,1,3]])
 AntiSquid: loop ROWS read tableRow:string(256)  mean it loops ROWS times and reads ROWS amount of lines, in this case tableRows 
 AntiSquid: loop 4 read n
 AntiSquid: does this help&#160;?
 LionMask: okk
 AntiSquid: which language Ordonnateur
 Ordonnateur: python sry ^^'
 LionMask: thanks Antisquid it help i never forget you

 LionMask: no
 Tiffion: sad
 LionMask: yeah 15 min is sufficent for a clash
 LionMask: Tiffion
 Tiffion: i now, but i had trouble doing a code i would like to continue trying even after the clash
 Tiffion: but without needing to do it local also
 davilla: that seems reasonable
 davilla: I wonder if there's a way to find it

 DaNinja: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=herokuapp+codingame">https://www.google.com/search?q=herokuapp+codingame</a>

 NASADeveloper102: :thinking: I think Assembly at codingame would be a bad idea 
 NASADeveloper102: Does anyone else think this? :eyes:
 davilla: which architecture?
 NASADeveloper102: x86-64
 davilla: I think you meant bad ass
 NASADeveloper102: :eyes: Writing good assembly is very hard, at least for me
 NASADeveloper102: I guess I could just use asm in C++
 NASADeveloper102: Does that work?
 struct: yes
 davilla: I thought C actually allowed assembly
 Westicles: Uggh.  Brings back memories of trying to go through airport security with my nerd kit back in the day
 davilla: hold on let me grab some popcorn
 davilla: OK I'm ready, please continue
 Westicles: Not much of a story.  Back in college they gave us a little suitcase full of protoboards and power supplies.  
 davilla: oh I see... yeah that would totally not fly today
 Westicles: Had to build the HW from scratch and program in assembly.  Kind of embarrassing lugging it around
 Ordonnateur: Hum... I knew I created a monster that was working by dark magic but I was hoping not being alone when looking at solutions made by others ç_ç (If someone ever read anything about why the dark magic part of my code work I'm interested in ^^' <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/test-before-validate!/solution?id=18605640">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/test-before-validate!/solution?id=18605640</a>)

 Ordonnateur: :hugging:
 Saburoto: can you debug?
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course, gimme your code and I'll debug it for free in less than an hour.
 struct: Do you mean printing error messages?
 ZarthaxX: i think he means actually using a debugger inside IDE
 ZarthaxX: not possible if that's the case Saburoto
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes. I will not go in your IDE.
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Saburoto: @ZarthaxX yes, thanks for the info
 ZarthaxX: you are better off trying a testcase locally with a debugger Saburoto :P
 ZarthaxX: or putting tons of print messages and testing on cg hehe
 struct: ZarthaxX are you doing sofia labs challenge?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't think Buenos Aires is in Europe.
 BlaiseEbuth: But perhaps I'm wrong :thinking:
 struct: Just give them my address if you win
 ZarthaxX: struct nope
 ZarthaxX: no prize for me :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Just gimme the price if you win.
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ItayBeladev: Hi guys
 ZarthaxX: if i had a chance to win :P
 struct: So this time entire europe is eligible for prizes?
 BlaiseEbuth: A list of european contries

 JLukeSkywalker: for code of ice and fire, can you spawn a unit on an opponents tile, and does that count as attacking if they have a unit there?
 AntiSquid: see statement, it keeps changing for early league what units can conquer what
 BlaiseEbuth: RTFM
 AntiSquid: perform sentiment analysis on the statement

 struct: I think the pods inputs will still be given
 Illedan: Ah
 Illedan: Yeah I think so
 struct: I dont think it matters much anyways
 struct: I dont see top players timing out
 BlaiseEbuth: Why timing out&#160;?
 struct: random timeouts might happen
 JLukeSkywalker: lol 'you can now train lvl 2 and 3 units' bot doesnt care and just steamrolls the league with lvl 1's
 struct: Boost = 650 thrust right?
 BlaiseEbuth: ya
 orangesnowfox: hey jacek, how deep does your onitama go
 therealbeef: damn that sofia challenge. threw a lol-submit at it before sleeping, and it got to 6th. now it's too tempting not to optimize :angry:
 jacek: its mcts-ept, so hard to compare
 orangesnowfox: ah
 struct: realbeef time to add avx
 jacek: it goes to 9-10 levels in the beginning, about 20 midgame and over 30 when there are only wizards
 jrke: sophia challenge still there?
 jacek: i create about 35k-50k nodes per turn
 orangesnowfox: ah, yeah... Mine doesn't go *quite* that far
 orangesnowfox: Oh, I create &gt; 100k
 jacek: mine is probably more selective
 orangesnowfox: Probably, my move selection is just "meh"
 orangesnowfox: I could *probably* squeeze out an extra depth in the early game, definitely can squeeze out a lot during the late game
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/538235315">https://www.codingame.com/replay/538235315</a> before my bot knew it lost it only took like... 14ms
 orangesnowfox: ... nvm, odd even effect kinda kills that at some points
 jacek: its minimax?
 orangesnowfox: negamax + alphabeta + TT
 jacek: and iterative deepening i suppose
 orangesnowfox: yeah
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 orangesnowfox: It's uhh, *fixed* iterative deepening currently, still working on that part
 jacek: huh
 orangesnowfox: It goes from depth 2 to 8
 orangesnowfox: ... It doesn't properly look at the time
 jacek: nice rank advance tho
 orangesnowfox: You kept an :eye: on it? 
 orangesnowfox: that is, not the emote I was expecting
 jacek: somewhat
 orangesnowfox: mm, todays changes took me from 16 to 13
 jacek: above the game contributor

 ZarthaxX: &gt;struct  01:49PMI just applied when they were asking for more mods
 ZarthaxX: jacek smart? :P
 ZarthaxX: you could be banhammering trolls
 jacek: i could ban myself by accident
 BlaiseEbuth: personally, I harassed Tibo during an entire year, until he give me the rights.
 ZarthaxX: why did that work? lol
 jacek: blackmail
 BlaiseEbuth: 'cause he like his tranquility&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: i mean harassing a cg mod and getting what you want doesnt seem possible
 BlaiseEbuth: Depend of who's harassing... :smiling_imp:
 Scarfield: MK did the same i think?

 jacek: ban
 struct: Public referee is not available right?
 Illedan: nope
 struct: Damn
 struct: I wanted to play alone&#160;:(
 Illedan: Just steal SR referee and add a player&#160;;)
 ShortBaited: is there an api to get the placement of me i ncoc?
 ShortBaited: in coc*
 struct: There is no "public" api
 ShortBaited: Oh okey&#160;:(
 Illedan: You can find some in the network tab, but I think you need auth for that
 Illedan: Which is simple enough&#160;:)
 ShortBaited: Okey i go look for it
 Eltech: hey
 Eltech: got a little question
 Eltech: what should I use to measure the time remaining before a timeout in python? time.time doesn't seem to give me what I am looking for
 struct: time.time_ns()?
 struct: it should do the same
 struct: but returns an integer
 Scarfield: time.time() returns a float of seconds since epoc in python iirc. multiply with 1000 to get milli seconds, call in start of turn, and compare the difference between the start turn time and later calls should work just fine
 struct: any new panic room yet?
 struct: escape*
 Eltech: wtf
 Eltech: that's what I was trying to do, turns out my time seems to go haywire
 Eltech: 0.2, 0.09, 0.17 ... those are the time spent after 1, 2, 3 consecutive iterations
 Scarfield: no new rooms yet no, just checked
 Scarfield: maybe you check the duration between iterations, and not the total duration since first time stamp
 Eltech: nope, just checked, for some reason my start variable changes value on its own 
 Eltech: may be due to using floats
 Eltech: lemme check the ns version
 Eltech: still moving
 Eltech: but more flexible at least
 Scarfield: well it seems like thats the issue, figure out why that value changes, and you should be all good
 Eltech: good grief
 ElfuegoCoder: HI
 Astrobytes: LO
 ShortBaited: anyone want that i create some docs to the private api from codingame?
 Astrobytes: A few people have done so in the past, feel free to do your own
 ShortBaited: yeah but there like 4 years ago and i did see a few minutes some changes in the request bodys
 Astrobytes: There's a few more recent (I don't have the links off the top of my head right now) but yeah, there have been changes. Go for it&#160;:)
 ShortBaited: Okey&#160;:)

 CodeChamp101: YES HIM
 orangesnowfox: oh, CodeChamp
 CodeChamp101: dhs
 CodeChamp101:&#160;?
 CodeChamp101: dhs?
 orangesnowfox: I just confused myself :pensive:
 CodeChamp101: oh so you hog?
 The_10x_Engineer: My friends and I are trying to use what we learned in school for Ghost in the Shell. It is working, just not well. I think we need more discrete dynamical systems or better datastructures or somethin
 The_10x_Engineer: I mean more knoweldge of those things
 PatrickMcGinnisII: GitC is my favorite
 The_10x_Engineer: GitC lol
 orangesnowfox: The_10x_Engineer, what are you currently trying, and why are you *thinking* it doesn't work?
 The_10x_Engineer: thats what  meant 
 CodeChamp101: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://fastsupport.gotoassist.com/">https://fastsupport.gotoassist.com/</a>
 CodeChamp101: nope not good website
 CodeChamp101: poopoo
 CodeChamp101: bye 
 CodeChamp101: sleep good
 orangesnowfox: Well, yeah, GitC
 CodeChamp101: poop good
 CodeChamp101: sleep good
 CodeChamp101: poop good
 CodeChamp101: fart good
 CodeChamp101: eat good
 The_10x_Engineer: orangesnowfox we actually haven't written any code, it's just been paperwork trying to come up with a good strategy
 CodeChamp101: eat food
 BigFatDecker: where did you get the v from in (vx*3)?
 orangesnowfox: v is "velocity"
 The_10x_Engineer: I'm sure it'll pop into my head sometime
 The_10x_Engineer: 💡🧠
 orangesnowfox: The_10x_Engineer, probably the first thing to do would be "try something" even if it isn't good, science is fun
 The_10x_Engineer: I think all of us are afraid since we'
 The_10x_Engineer: we've worked on this for like an hour and if we choose a bad strategy we'll have mental breakdowns or something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The_10x_Engineer try bellman_ford algorithm to determine shortest routes
 orangesnowfox: What league are you in?
 The_10x_Engineer: Wood 1 :joy:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: variation on Dijkstra
 The_10x_Engineer: PatrickMcGinnisII :eyes: I've done enough graph theory for today
 The_10x_Engineer: I'll check it out later
 orangesnowfox: Patrick, do you have hints for how I can start handling inc? I somehow made it all the way to mid-gold without it, but my brain is not computing this properly
 BigFatDecker: yep i still dont get this
 PatrickMcGinnisII: inc?
 orangesnowfox: yee, inc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dunno what you are referring to
 orangesnowfox:  in GitC?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh
 The_10x_Engineer: inc?
 The_10x_Engineer: increasing production rate?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, factory thing
 The_10x_Engineer: factory go brrrrr
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it depends on your approach, the basics is a math problem
 The_10x_Engineer: 😰not another one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can an enemy take your factory if you spend the men
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if it takes 5 turns for E men to reach your node (if your node has &gt;=10 men), will you have enough defenders kinda thing
 orangesnowfox: ... I barely look 2 turns in the future for checking if I'll have enough when the opponents hit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the 5 is arbitrary
 PatrickMcGinnisII: always inc if you can imho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but sometimes the advantage of attacking must be taken
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on your sim
 orangesnowfox: "sim? what sim" Yeah... The problem is I never have enough borgs in one spot, or they get spent on attacking right after they arrive...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you have the advantage, you can send out all your units and overwhelm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if not, then you have to eval
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or sim
 orangesnowfox: never figured out how to do variable move turns with a sim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: start with something like an array of turns where you drop the # of enemy that can reach your node in those turns...if you will have more...then inc, otherwise don't
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the tricky part is sending units to factories in the back to inc them faster, it gets wierd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: factories that make nothing are not strategic
 orangesnowfox: Yeah
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... My main problem is keeping the bots in one place long enough to inc it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it all depends on whether you have the overall advantage or not, agressive bots do perform better
 orangesnowfox: Well, I have that in spades
 PatrickMcGinnisII: haven't looked at my code in a long time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lemme see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, i only did silver
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/538323080">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/538323080</a> Honestly... In this particular replay, I seem to be having trouble actually commiting to captures
 orangesnowfox: oh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I use php tho, so my sims are short
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gitc was the most fun for me.
 orangesnowfox: GitC is a lot of fun, I'm currently addicted to onitama though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i made so many versions of gitc bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, i didn't inc correctly in the version I have up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: although it does inc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: silver boss incs earlier than i do and swallows me up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gl
 orangesnowfox: lol
 BigFatDecker: how is this  if(next_checkpoint_angle &gt;= 90) not in a function for python?
 davilla: check the line before
 davilla: also do you have a colon at the end?

 Smelty: i cant view those for some reason&#160;:((
 Smelty: can u try pastebin.co
 Smelty: *com
 Wontonimo: &gt; Sorry, pastebin.com has been blocked by your network administrator.
 hexa8: LOL
 Wontonimo: work computer ... so sad
 Smelty: RIP
 Smelty: codingame.pastebin is blocked by mine
 phord: Ooh... I didn't even notice seeds could be cast outside of shadows.
 Smelty: sooo
 Smelty: we r stuck
 Smelty:  in dms
 Kolo9: if I'm understanding the definition of "knight moves" correctly, you can use the provided neighbors list
 Kolo9: and do neighbor[0][1]
 Kolo9: or neighbor[1][2]
 Kolo9: etc
 actualCoderTrevor: Smelty he said: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/8FwEfYKQ">https://pastebin.com/8FwEfYKQ</a>
 Smelty: ah he already showed me in dms
 Smelty: thanks tho!
 actualCoderTrevor: lol oops yw
 Enknable: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_compiler.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_compiler.asp</a>
 icecream17: oh i know how to do calculate distance!
 Enknable: should be able to drop code in there
 icecream17: or rahter, getCoordsInRange
 icecream17: getCoordsAtRange(3) = cell neighbor neighbor neighbor but not cell or cell neighbor or cell nieghbor neighbor
 icecream17: getCoordsInRange = cell neighbor neighbor neighbor, remove duplicates
 phord: If seeds are dropped on same cell at the same time, it's a no-op.  I should make my bot retry if that happens.  What if the opp also retries.  I wonder if we can get a game with 100,000 moves.  Surely it must kill us both at some point.
 icecream17: no the tree disables after an action
 phord: Ah, I see that now.
 phord: I noticed some leaders were delaying completing trees until the end.  Effective strategy because of shadows.
 phord: But then I noticed other leaders had better planning and well-distributed scoring.
 ChrisJM: I imagine search AIs will be blocking sunlight naturally if they have enough depth
 Enknable: trees inside trees
 phord: Too many trees cuts down your own sun points, though.
 Wontonimo: phord, once your tree throws a seed it becomes dormant and can no longer act in that day
 jsmurl: i just loaded the spring challenge on chrome on a windows PC and just see a grey box, anyone have tips how to fix?
 actualCoderTrevor: I remember hearing it's a known issue for some people. Can you try Firefox?
 jsmurl: yea it works on firefox, just wondering if there is a fix
 jsmurl: seeing this in the inspector: TypeError: Cannot read property 'resize' of undefined
 actualCoderTrevor: Didn't hear about a fix just the issue. Maybe someone else will correct me though.
 Jeanpier: I dont know why my ranking is 9300th and there is another ranking whichs says that I'm  2277 th 
 Kolo9: jsmurl mine resolved after I updated Chrome. Do you have an update pending? (top right)
 Enknable: Jeanpier you're 9300 overall
 Enknable: and 2277th in this competition?
 Enknable: or some other sub category
 phord: I use Brave (Chromium) and haven't had any problems.
 jsmurl: Kolo9, looks like I'm up to date :thinking:
 Kolo9: damn&#160;:( yeah I heard other people having the same issue. not sure why it worked for me
 itzluku: hahahahh i submitted my latest version and lost the first game in the arena
 itzluku: XDDD
 itzluku: good start
 itzluku: whata re the odds to fight other new submissions
 Kolo9: haha from what I've seen it *seems* like when you submit a new version, it'll pit you against some people around the rank you were before
 Kolo9: in the first few battles
 Enknable: jsmuri <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>
 Enknable: or try firefox :nerd:
 jsmurl: ah I had to enable hardware acceleration
 jsmurl: I had it disabled because I was running into some weird issues on youtube a while back
 actualCoderTrevor: Awesome my bot now keeps track of his energy level throughout the match perfectly without having to read it from the input \o/
 phord: noice
 itzluku: usefull for sim?
 actualCoderTrevor: That's the idea&#160;:)
 itzluku: else only error-prone imo
 actualCoderTrevor: Up next will come predicting which moves increase the net energy
 Smelty: hmm
 itzluku: btw guys
 itzluku: what is the max score ur bot can get?
 itzluku: 100? :O
 phord: I've seen 133.
 itzluku: ?_?
 itzluku: #1 has 58.71
 phord: Do you mean the game score? (points)
 itzluku: leaderboard bot score
 itzluku: sry my bad
 itzluku: i achieved a game score &gt; 165 once iirc
 itzluku: uh new #2
 phord: Leaderboard score seems to be a composite tournament ranking thing, maybe?
 itzluku: hm i would argue (since they programmed the game and it doesnt have too much complexity (?)) that there is a way to calculate every possible choice in polynomial time
 itzluku: meaning they can rate your choice
 itzluku: but i am not sure
 phord: Then they wouldn't need head-2-head, would they?
 itzluku: head-2-head?
 phord: You're ranked based on wins vs. opponents.  The top leaders will be the ones who adjust their choices based on their opponenet's moves.
 phord: Complexity is not trivial in these games.
 itzluku: wait
 itzluku: but there is a problem
 itzluku: how do u know what options ur opponent will have&#160;?
 itzluku: since seeds are random for example
 itzluku: and u cant simulate in depth to see when your opp might sell a tree
 icecream17: you dont know the order, but you know what they are
 icecream17: if you write your own game simulator
 phord: You are told where the opp's trees are after each turn.  So you can see what they're doing.
 itzluku: but u dont know they seed indices he can place seeds on
 itzluku: and u dont know if he will complete a tree
 itzluku: 2nd u could iterate
 itzluku: 1st not
 phord: You can know which indices he can play on.
 Enknable: you know everything he can do
 Enknable: and everything you can do
 icecream17: you can generate legal moves, you dont know which move opp will pick
 phord: Consider: you do not need the possibleActions list.
 itzluku: hm so sim has to take into account what seed indices might be possible
 itzluku: but then your sim would play against a migthy more powerfull opponent that inst real
 itzluku: meaning sim would choose worse
 itzluku: ^^
 Enknable: it has to take into account the shadow on the 10000th iteration
 itzluku: no?
 Enknable: your sim only create the game tree
 Enknable: the way that you prioritize moves
 Enknable: is the strategy
 phord: Sim could choose the best move for the oppo, and the oppo may make a dumber move.  But then you can adjust your planning accordingly.
 itzluku: yeh but the depth of your sim is finite
 phord: The games are also finite.
 itzluku: and u have to take moves into consideration that wount be possible for your opponent
 itzluku: since seed is random
 itzluku:&#160;?
 phord: Seed is random?
 itzluku: yes?
 Wontonimo: random_seed
 phord: oh -- lol.  not SEED
 Enknable: rand(seed)
 Wontonimo: not to be confused with the thing in the game called a seed
 itzluku: game seeds
 itzluku: are given
 itzluku: but generated by sth unknown
 itzluku: true?
 phord: You don't need anything to do with the rand(seed) when simulating moves.
 actualCoderTrevor: You mean the random game board? That's established right from the get-go
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Enknable: you also dont calculate the whole tree on the first turn
 itzluku: u get a set of seed options per turn
 itzluku: those seed options are soem what random
 Enknable: you calculate as much as you can, make the best decision you can, then prune and continue
 phord: You may not be able to plan all the way to game-end within the timeout. But you can do very well by only looking a few moves ahead.
 actualCoderTrevor: Those aren't random, they are predetermined based on the rules, and they're just provided for convenience
 itzluku: let me break it down more simpler
 itzluku: i think u guys dont get my point
 phord: Aw, crap.  My improved bot fell in ranking.  :-(
 Wontonimo: well look at that, when you fix a bug your bot does better.  yeah me.
 phord: "improved"
 actualCoderTrevor: phord that's been a constant with me
 phord: actualCoderTrevor but I was beating my Arena code in testing pretty well.  :-\
 itzluku: if u sim for the best move, lets say minmax then u have to go throug heach possible seed index your opp might plant a seed. but ur opp only has a fraction of those seed indices to plant a seed... meaning u simulate against a better opp than u actually have
 actualCoderTrevor: I think other bots are improving faster than I can improve mine. I dropped from 110 to 430
 Enknable: silver doesnt open for 3 days
 Enknable: dont worry&#160;:)
 phord: My strategy spends all the sun points I can every day.  I'm growing multiple trees right up to the last day.  What a waste.
 itzluku: @actualCoderTrevor if u dont handle shadows for example, then its kinda luck every time u test your bot :p
 itzluku: mix of opp getting better and luck might be a factor
 actualCoderTrevor: itzluku how'd you know I don't handle shadows? :P
 phord: itzluku You can predict how many seeds your opp can actually plant each day and limit your sim to only planting that many in each scenario.
 itzluku: just said if :P
 actualCoderTrevor: lol well you were right
 itzluku: i'm also not handling shadows yet
 itzluku: #181
 itzluku: xd
 actualCoderTrevor: show-off :P
 Wontonimo: okay, i'm not handling shadows either.  just resubmitted and I'm placing around 28th
 actualCoderTrevor: :O
 itzluku: @phord but those limited scenarios migth still be more difficult, meaning the sim plays against a better opp
 actualCoderTrevor: It's an arms-race no matter which strategy you use.
 phord: Your search tree can include _all_ the opps possible moves.  You don't have to play against one of them; you play against all of them.
 itzluku: in your sim your opp would for example have seed index options of richness 3 but in reality he only has richness1 seed index options
 itzluku: that is my point
 actualCoderTrevor: Then your sim is bad
 phord: Then ask yourself, of all the branches where I win, what move do they have most in common from this point of the game?
 phord: Play that move.  Then prune your tree of others.  Watch what your opp does; prune your tree of all his other moves.  Go back to step 1.
 itzluku: if u play against an opp that is better in your sim, then u might det a different move than u would if u knew what he is limited to
 Enknable: one move does not lead to one result
 phord: Why do you think opp would have different options in reality vs. the ones in your sim?
 Enknable: each move leaves you with thousands of game states
 phord: You are playing on the same grid.
 Enknable: you dont move based off one state
 Enknable: you move based off of the group of states
 itzluku: bro u dont get my point
 actualCoderTrevor: At a high-level of play, how well you can predict and outmaneuver your opponent will affect how well you do against them. That's true of a sim or a heuristic.
 Enknable: if you use MCTS anyways
 Enknable: itzluku do you know MCTS?
 Enknable: multiarmed bandit?
 itzluku: reality is a subquantity of your sim, ofc ur sim has all the options but those distinct options in your sim not actually appearing influence your choice
 JohnCM: wonder if python is enough for this challenge
 JohnCM: i try first and see if i timeout
 Xenoid: #2, #3, #4 all are using Python
 phord: Your sim doesn't make a choice and then pretend there were no other options.
 phord: Your sim makes *all* the choices and then uses some aggregate view to decide how to improve your score while reducing your opp score.
 Wontonimo: for those who are new-ish to this site, there is a "trueskill" score beside the names in the leaderboard.  iirc, every 4 points in score (not position) is about 80/20 win ratio difference.
 phord: I fixed my code again.  My rank went wayyy up again.  Woohoo!  Oh, down is good, right?  :-(
 itzluku: but you make a choice based on what your opp can respond with, you have a bias. thats simple bayes.. and the bias in your sim is different to reality since i nreality your opponent only has a subset of the quantity holding all possible moves in theory
 VizGhar: I'll probably have to write some unit tests :P not sure if my results are 100%
 phord: Fact: Your opp has a limited set of possible next moves. Fact: Your sim can know exactly what the opp's choices are for the next move.
 VizGhar: yeey dbd r is first&#160;:) huge fan
 phord: Right?
 itzluku: yes
 VizGhar: yes
 JohnCM: lol i only wrote 6 lines of code, and i think i can go bronze already
 phord: So, the best your sim can probably do is predict which next moves will maximize the opp's score.
 JohnCM: XD
 kovi: nice dbdr!
 dbdr: thanks VizGhar!
 dbdr: and kovi&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: GZ dbdr
 phord: Then you play to minimize the effect f those predicted moves.  Or you play to minimize the opp's gain on average across all his possible moves.
 dbdr: small idea I had yesterday in the bath :D
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: if else stil?
 VizGhar: oh... bath
 JohnCM: hi there kovi, dbdr
 itzluku: thats why your sim might choose a path that is outside of the subset
 dbdr: no, BS
 phord: Which subset do you mean?
 phord: And which "chosen path" are you talking about?
 itzluku: i agree with u on how simulations work
 itzluku: that isn't my point
 phord: Well, good, because I didn't make this up.  It's not really my opinion.  lol
 itzluku: i know
 ZarthaxX: dbdr ah okey, didnt know bullsh*t worked so well
 itzluku: u are kinda talking away from my points
 ZarthaxX: anyway, gz :D
 phord: What "subset" do you mean?  
 PaarthThePro: Has anyone started the Spring Challenge?
 itzluku: sim has more variations right?
 icecream17: yes paarth
 icecream17: ok submitting
 PaarthThePro: I'm already on bronze
 DetoBot: is the response time per turn is 100ms or has some offset
 itzluku: more options for your opp to plant seeds than in reality, more options for u to plant seeds in more depth
 phord: More variations than what?  Reality?
 phord: No.
 itzluku:&#160;?
 icecream17: well i think some people proved that anything within reality is less complicated then reality
 icecream17: dont remember the wikipedia article
 phord: You have the same number of options.  In reality, you will only choose one of those options on each turn.  But you had all of them available to you.
 itzluku: lets say my oponen has teh option to plant 2 seeds 31 7 and 31 33 , then he has 2 options&#160;? but your sim doesnt know that.. your sim would check for every index that doesnt hold a tree
 phord: No.  Your sim DOES know that.
 actualCoderTrevor: Again, it's a bad sim if it's doing that
 phord: Why wouldn't you know that?
 itzluku:&#160;?
 icecream17: your sim is as accurate as the game itself
 itzluku: wait
 actualCoderTrevor: itzluku, as I've said before, the options available for planting a seed are spelled out in the rules. There's no randomness to it.
 phord: Look at the opps trees.  Calculate his sun points.  Now you know exactly which seed options he has available.
 itzluku: but u cant plant a sed anywhere u want???
 itzluku: seed*
 itzluku: wtf they are?
 icecream17: the rules say seeds must be within (size) distance from (non disabled tree)
 Enknable: This game is: Perfect information
 icecream17: size=tree size
 phord: No, you can only plan seeds where you are allowed: Within "size" distance, on non-zero richness ground, and within your sun points budget.
 itzluku: wtf i did'nt knew that
 itzluku: well that explains alot
 icecream17: ...rules were right there =/
 icecream17: wait
 icecream17: meant to do something else
 icecream17: i guess the emoticon could be parsed that way...
 icecream17: "=/"
 itzluku: @phord yeh then my point is not longer valid. i thought u get a random set of possible seed spots and have to choose from that...
 itzluku: but thanks for the discussion :D was still fun
 Enknable: even if they were random...
 Enknable: they're finite
 itzluku: xD
 Enknable:&#160;;)
 itzluku: not again
 itzluku: :D:D
 phord: itzluku I'm glad we sorted that out. lol
 phord: Have fun!
 itzluku: finite but your sim would take into account moves that wouldnt appear... meaning u would make choices based on wrong assumptions (bayes theory)
 phord: =/
 phord: =\
 actualCoderTrevor: Stahp
 itzluku: xd
 phord:&#160;:/ =/ =\&#160;:\&#160;:-\&#160;:-/ =-[
 itzluku: haha
 actualCoderTrevor: lol
 phord: Wow -- so many that converge to the same dude.
 itzluku: if ur simulation calculates options that are not a valid option, then ur simulation might not give u the best option
 itzluku: processes*
 useAllTheThings: o __   /
 itzluku: whatever lets end it here :D
 JohnCM: yay with my wood 1 code I got rank 2.4k in bronze. time to improve on it
 Enknable: as long as the set of all random choices contain all valid moves, there's no difference between a random move and a chosen move.
 itzluku: i also yoinked an opening strat xd
 Enknable: if its invalid..then its just broken game
 JohnCM: when i count distances between cells, i can walk over cells with 0 richness right
 ZarthaxX: ye
 JohnCM: thanks
 itzluku: lets say u get 2 random seed spots that are valid as an input, each round, and your sim iterates over all 37-nr_cells_with_trees possible seed options, then u will calculate board structures that are not possible, meaning your sim choice is biased on assumign those were valid options, but they are not, in this construction 
 itzluku: @Enknable
 VizGhar: hmm winning way too much with pretty dumb heuristic
 VizGhar: maybe time to switch to search
 phord: Goodnight folks
 itzluku: is there a default index value for neighbors outside of the board?
 itzluku: gn
 VizGhar: mornin'
 VizGhar: yes -1
 itzluku: ty
 Enknable: itzluku haha sorry man I can't get what you're putting down. I don't see a difference between guessing what an opponent will choose, and guess what an opponent will be forced to do. Either way, that list of moves is finite and will never lead to invalid game states
 Enknable: :thinking:
 itzluku: okey different approach
 itzluku: this one u will get
 itzluku: your sim caluclates all seed options that are valid: 37-nr_cells_with_trees
 itzluku: right?
 Enknable: yes
 itzluku: lets say in this construct the opp will only have 2 given indices, meaning only 2 valid options ( 2 out of those 37-nr_cells_with_trees)
 itzluku: ok?
 Chainman: Can we play this game manually?
 Zaphus: what do you mean by 2 given indices?
 itzluku: options=["SEED 31 18","SEED 17 12"]
 itzluku: for example
 Zaphus: ok, so you are not saying there are 37-trees valid options, there are only 2
 actualCoderTrevor: Chainman look up photosynthesis board game; it's based on that
 itzluku: yeh
 itzluku: that is the construct
 Enknable: yes, so if they are given 2 valid options, then we calculate 1332 different states
 Zaphus: why would you do that?
 itzluku: that is not how this game here works, but that is the construct i am making my argument with now
 itzluku: now my point is
 Zaphus: just doesnt seem logical.  If they only have two choices, then there must only be 2 valid options, so you have 2 states 
 Zaphus: well, three if you include waiting
 Enknable: they are "Dealt" their seeds positions
 Enknable: which are 2 random hex in a 37 board
 Enknable:&#160;?
 Zaphus: is this in a different theoretical game, not this one&#160;?
 DetoBot: My chat bot is ready
 Enknable: yeah lol
 DetoBot: match against me
 DetoBot: to have a look
 Zaphus: so confusing&#160;:-)  in that case you have  (37-trees) * (37-1-trees) states
 Zaphus: prob divide by two because order doesnt matter
 itzluku: if the sim would know that the opp only has those 2 options, meaning the sim would know what those 2 options are (B) then:P(A|B) =/ P(A)with A being the thext move
 Enknable: ^
 itzluku: next*
 Enknable: how would your sim
 Enknable: know what the opp moves would be...5000 states into the future
 itzluku:&#160;?
 itzluku: its a finite game
 itzluku: 24days
 itzluku: why 5000 states
 Enknable: there aren't 2 options..
 itzluku: 2 start trees each
 Enknable: oh man
 Enknable: im totally lost lol
 itzluku: so max 33 indices to plant a tree for each turn
 Wontonimo: Enknable , there are lots of search possibilities for sim
 Enknable: oh yeah I agree Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: what i mean is, you could do a simple DFS and ignore the opponent.
 Wontonimo: for example
 Wontonimo: and it would do really well
 itzluku: DFS for what
 Enknable: yeah, I was actually thinking it would be better
 Wontonimo: DFS for maxing points before the game ends
 Enknable: if you constantly just play optimally solo
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo holy you are if else master
 itzluku: best board weight?
 Enknable: you might lose to weird strategies
 Enknable: but overall i think you win more
 Wontonimo: thanks ZarthaxX&#160;!  :D
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Wontonimo: how you know that latest bot is if/else&#160;?
 itzluku: can u check code of others? :D
 Wontonimo: nope.  maybe admin.
 itzluku: admin abuse :x
 ZarthaxX: no haha
 ZarthaxX: i just thought so because python and 2 days of contest
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: many ppl just like doing heuristics as they give fast results and have fun while doing so
 ZarthaxX: it's pretty common
 ZarthaxX: to encounter if else spaghetti i mean

 JohnCM: yuusanlondon's bot is very funny to watch. lots of random japanese words
 Wontonimo: so close!
 DetoBot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/548739497">https://www.codingame.com/replay/548739497</a>
 DetoBot: @Wontonimo :joy:
 itzluku: when do u check for shadows? 
 UndercoverToad: yuusanlondon is playing? i've seen that name on topcoder before
 UndercoverToad: oh at 2nd place even
 itzluku: @DetoBot u need check nutrients value, if ur opp completes trees it will drop and u will get less if u sell after him
 itzluku: complete*
 Wontonimo: hey DetoBot , add something to prefer seed placement where the neighbours are not your own trees.  it'll help you not shadow yourself so much
 DetoBot: thanks working on a new bot for past few hours
 DetoBot: will include your advice too
 itzluku: next step for me is checking how many enemy and team trees a tree would shadow for the next x moves , to decide if i want to sell it or not
 itzluku: what else would be important to check (related to shadows)
 itzluku:&#160;?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: size of the shadow
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I forgot to add to mine
 itzluku: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/548751832">https://www.codingame.com/replay/548751832</a>
 itzluku: xd
 itzluku: how do i win against u like that but im still onyl #182
 itzluku: wtf xd
 DetoBot: submit again
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: nice itzluku
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I sometimes win against higher players in the IDE but not consistently
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: if your bot can beat mine like 5 times out of 10 it should probably be around 50-60 as well
 itzluku: same
 itzluku: its the shadows
 itzluku: need to figure out a way to simulate some stuff and handle shadows
 itzluku: else it wil lalways be a coinflip
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: your bot spreads the trees out more over the grid. Mine currently doesn't do that well
 itzluku: i check the neighbors for seed spots
 VizGhar: LOL bfs timing out for depth 2 in dart... well maybe it is bad language :D
 VizGhar: or maybe im the one who is wroong
 jrke: yeah can timeout in depth 2 cause many possible moves
 WolfDarrigan: My Java times out at a depth of 3
 WolfDarrigan: I need to figure out how to compute transpositions
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: are we talking days or turns?
 WolfDarrigan: days for me
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: 3 days could be a lot of turns
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: or maybe not
 itzluku: wait, if ur opp waits, then u dont get an input of possible moves
 itzluku: meaning if i grow a t2 tree to t3 and he waits, then i dont know i have a t3 tree to complete
 itzluku: xd
 WolfDarrigan: Yeah, I'm computing possible moves and shadow movement. If I had enough time, I could simulate the whole game
 StyllyMyle: I have a little question
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: simulation seems difficult for a game like this
 itzluku: just ask :D
 StyllyMyle: so i see that we get sun from trees the same time sun direction changes
 StyllyMyle: but i wana ask, do we get sun before or direction changes?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I think after
 WolfDarrigan: Sun moves, then generates sun points
 StyllyMyle: So first sun get harvested, then direction changes
 StyllyMyle: wait what?
 WolfDarrigan: the sun moves first
 StyllyMyle: Sun moves first
 StyllyMyle: then check all tiles which are spooky
 Enknable: :ghost:
 lge.innocent: can you make 2 or more actions a day?
 WolfDarrigan: correct StyllyMyle
 itzluku: yes in bronze
 itzluku: i think i wood u cant
 itzluku: in*
 WolfDarrigan: you can make as many actions as you like
 WolfDarrigan: you just need the sun points for it
 StyllyMyle: I see
 lge.innocent: ok thanks
 StyllyMyle: so 2 action limit is non existent
 WolfDarrigan: and you can't act on a tree that is dormant
 StyllyMyle: make sense
 StyllyMyle: Can only work on tree once
 StyllyMyle: before day over
 itzluku: btw u can die if u make a move that costs more sun points than u have
 itzluku: xd
 StyllyMyle: WAIIIT
 itzluku: haha
 StyllyMyle: Really :D
 itzluku: if it goes negative after your action
 Enknable: never go into debt to the sun god
 itzluku: :D
 StyllyMyle: Any algo that makes sun go negative?
 StyllyMyle: I never thought to utilize the negative bounds of sun 
 The_ZimaBlue: idts
 itzluku: seed and grow
 itzluku: have a cost
 StyllyMyle: complete also have a cost r8
 The_ZimaBlue: but u wont do the action if u dont have enough sun points
 itzluku: complete has no cost?
 The_ZimaBlue: 4
 The_ZimaBlue: 4 sun points
 StyllyMyle: I gttg
 itzluku: lol
 itzluku: xD
 itzluku: guess i am just lucky
 Enknable: later all
 Enknable: happy coding&#160;:)
 itzluku: cya
 itzluku: ah nvm, since i just take possible actions from the input that action just wount show
 itzluku: thats why i dont die
 itzluku: :D
 JohnCM: when is silver coming out?
 dbdr: JohnCM click on "Bronze league" at the top
 JohnCM: ah ok thanks
 Tiramon: ok seems my state restructuring is working and should give me some more sims ...
 UndercoverToad: i got my sim more than 6 times as fast with bitboards :tada:but something is wrong, I only find WAIT as legal action
 Tiramon: atleast that is always a valid action&#160;;)
 dbdr: fast, correct, simple: pick any 2&#160;;)
 Tiramon: is that your non automaton pingable  account?
 dbdr: oh, it's a toad!
 Tiramon: but he is undercover
 dbdr: true, who could that be? that german toad?
 Marchete: happy caturday
 DaNinja: morning
 Marchete: nice work as always, dbdr
 UndercoverToad: chat got too laggy so I made a new account
 Tiramon: if this works out i should atleast get 10-20 times more sims ... and yes before it was far to slow&#160;:)
 dbdr: thanks Marchete!actuallz I'm not used to such rank in a contest
 khalkhoul: hello
 khalkhoul: helllo
 Tiramon: wow 1st nice 
 Tiramon: gratz dbdr =)
 UndercoverToad: now defend that rank with teeth and claws
 jacek: happy Caturday
 dbdr: should I become a wolf then? or bear?
 itzluku: will they add more functionality for silver? like.. more features
 jacek: a small horse
 dbdr: a prince has no claws
 UndercoverToad: a manbearpig
 dbdr: I'll pass
 UndercoverToad: southpark?&#160;:(
 dbdr: my princess might not like it
 JohnCM: yes i realize euler is missing
 UndercoverToad: where might he be?
 UndercoverToad: :spy:
 dbdr: UndercoverToad sub your bitboarded wait bot
 dbdr: someone was asking for one yesterday
 UndercoverToad: you can't even play against it as it will be below top1000
 dbdr: search
 UndercoverToad: i find the possible actions now
 UndercoverToad: but still waiting first and applying actions on the next day
 Marchete: I'm puzzled, 3 pythons and 1 JS at top10
 UndercoverToad: the contest is less than 2 days old
 dbdr: I say two days is long enough, let's stop
 Marchete: let me rephrase
 geio: can we change colorscheme in editor in codingame
 Marchete: some of the top10 already has a sim bot, depth N
 DaNinja: yes, in Setting on the left
 Marchete: yet python/Js can compete
 geio: :o
 dbdr: oh, that would be a anti-hiding feature: end of contest is kept secret (random)
 dbdr: i'm sure nobody would mind
 UndercoverToad: also anti-testing feature
 UndercoverToad: don't submit when you aren't sure it's better
 dbdr: yes :D
 dbdr: UndercoverToad do you bitboard in C# or C++?
 UndercoverToad: C#
 UndercoverToad: they really stepped up, there is even <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.bitoperations.popcount?view=net-5.0">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.bitoperations.popcount?view=net-5.0</a>
 itzluku: hm i found a bug
 UndercoverToad: i found a bit of code between the bugs
 dbdr: remove it!
 itzluku: i have a t3 tree and 4suns, but it doesnt show complete as an option
 Tiramon: is it dormant?
 CBORJDNHR: is everyone in the top 100 using a minimax&#160;?
 dbdr: no
 Marchete: the fixed pointer thingy in C# is annoying
 UndercoverToad: i don't think that minimax is the right algo for this game
 Tiramon: i'm 101 right now with my plain sort +5 ifelse so guess not
 itzluku: no, but u can complete dormant t3 trees so whatever
 Marchete: I was thinking that minimax or even MCTS
 jrke: i think only top30-40 currently only having algo based bot
 Marchete: can work
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I'm 50 ish without simulation
 Marchete: you just do the sim each 2 turns
 Tiramon: itzluku not afaik
 Marchete: and depth is always +=2
 UndercoverToad: are there any messages below your output itzluku?
 Tiramon: would be an action and dormant trees can't take actions
 UndercoverToad: in the game summary
 itzluku: what kind of msges
 Marchete: dormant completes?
 UndercoverToad: a text telling you why you screwed up
 Marchete: that's true?
 UndercoverToad: i'm pretty sure you can't complete dormant
 Tiramon: Tiramon is planting a seed on cell 23 from cell 24this also tells if action is not possible for some reason
 itzluku: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/548787830">https://www.codingame.com/replay/548787830</a>
 itzluku: at the end blue sells a t3 tree taht is dormant
 itzluku: that*
 itzluku: ah nvm
 Tiramon: no it's not ..
 itzluku: tree is bigger
 itzluku: xd
 itzluku: well but still, my t43 on index 8 is not dormant
 itzluku: and i have 4 suns
 itzluku: last tick
 Tiramon: it is dormant ...
 itzluku: index 8&#160;?
 Tiramon: yes you have grown it .. so it is dormand
 Tiramon: *dormant
 itzluku: ah wtf
 Tiramon: make a mouseover
 itzluku: yeh im stupid
 itzluku: i thought dormant means its overshadowed
 itzluku: yikes&#160;:/
 Tiramon: dormant means it has taken an action on that day
 itzluku: ty
 Tiramon: spooky btw means it is in the shadow of a tree of his size or bigger
 itzluku: u can sell "spooky trees"&#160;?
 Tiramon: sure
 itzluku: complete*
 itzluku: kk
 Amanojaku: country
 Tiramon: you just won't get suns for spooky trees
 itzluku: aight thanks
 DaNinja: can this be optimized faster?
 DaNinja: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aff61519-8d4c-4db9-a1c7-18c313838884">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aff61519-8d4c-4db9-a1c7-18c313838884</a>
 Marchete: inline
 DaNinja: I have #pragma GCC optimize "O3,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"
 Marchete: I'm 100% the bottleneck will be at move generation or sun calculation
 Marchete: don't microoptimize these
 Marchete: 100% sure
 Vaibhav0705: hi
 pmor: Only way to optimize that function is to somehow get rid of the if branches
 resty-daze: good compiler could use cmov instrs  and avoid branches automatically i guess 
 RoboStac: might not be able to optimise it, but you probaly want to make it work properly by changing the 1&lt;&lt;idx to 1ULL&lt;&lt;idx (by default 1 is an int so is only 32 bit)
 pmor: maybe. will have to look at the disassembly
 DaNinja: thanks Robo good point
 martinpapa69: __builtin_clz (trees &amp; 0b111) 
 pmor: ^ that might do it
 kovi: +1 Marchete...seeding is costly...anything else is probably premature opt
 martinpapa69: oh nvm, i understood your code incorreclty, thats something else
 kovi: (collecting seed actions)
 UndercoverToad: this sounds completely weird but i find legal actions offline and not online
 itzluku: damn dbdr is smart :D he punished my not having enough suns and completed alot of t3's because i couldn't react and complete myself
 itzluku: my=me*
 itzluku: @UndercoverToads prob a bug on your end/model
 UndercoverToad: whoops, found it (or at least where to look at)
 UndercoverToad: i don't properly reset between each turn
 dbdr: itzluku my bot is not that smart, it
 dbdr: 's a conincidence
 itzluku: ok xd but it looked rly sick
 dbdr: can you link the replay?
 itzluku: overriden that condition state
 itzluku: or can i access it somewhere?
 itzluku: wasnt in teh arena
 Marchete: you consider your bot legend level, dbdr?
 Marchete: do*
 itzluku: how does the leaderboard scoe gets calculated again?
 itzluku: score*
 UndercoverToad: there is no legend level before tuesday
 dbdr: Marchete no. 100 gold maybe&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: you are better than that already but most likely not legend
 itzluku: top100 gold?
 Tiramon: ok from 3k-7k turns simulated yesterday to 21k-47k is an improvementand i also get other options than WAIT&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: i fixed that too
 UndercoverToad: and 100k tested plans in 1.4s now (was 3.4s)
 Tiramon: changing to bits from my previous list and streams was a real good idea&#160;;)
 Tiramon: what is a plan for you? complete playthrough from day 0 - 23?
 Marchete: blursed bitboards
 UndercoverToad: 2 days with actions. then WAIT till the end of game to count suns
 Tiramon: ok so on something up to 30 turns or so
 UndercoverToad: was testing a state from mid-game
 UndercoverToad: some actions to generate but no 23 days to fast-forward
 Tiramon: still a value that is not comparable =) only comparable sim value is amount of turns
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47cbdaf1-3b0d-4cfa-a8e8-6235e1969d03">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47cbdaf1-3b0d-4cfa-a8e8-6235e1969d03</a>
 UndercoverToad: i don't want to compare with you
 UndercoverToad: i want to compare bitboard vs non-bitboard
 Tiramon: primarly seed actions
 Tiramon: sure but i want to compare to know how slow i am&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: also don't listen to UndercoverToad, you won't even find me on the leaderboard
 Tiramon: right he is only rank3 ... what does he know ...
 UndercoverToad: i was around 150
 UndercoverToad: submitting that bitboard now
 Tiramon: is only simulating 2 days enough to complete all trees in the end?
 resty-daze: complete some trees may not worth it when there are no nutrients
 UndercoverToad: of course not
 UndercoverToad: i'm still building my sim, the use of it comes later
 Tiramon: complete trees are still more score than non completed trees ...
 itzluku: @dbdr i think u sell alot of t3's when u have too much suns :D
 itzluku: many*
 UndercoverToad: &gt; complete some trees may not worth it when there are no nutrients
 UndercoverToad: scoring function was smarter than me
 actualCoderTrevor: my bot with bugs does better than when I fix the bugs&#160;:(
 Tiramon: but yes completing richness 0 trees is a waste of suns in the end ... hm ...
 UndercoverToad: also my richness is always 0 in the current bitboard version&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: still have to include that again
 Tiramon: richness 1 i mean
 UndercoverToad: me too
 UndercoverToad: 0 point richness but seedable
 Tiramon: but you can doe the board/richness stuff static per game
 UndercoverToad: i still need a fast lookup
 Tiramon: int[] richness&#160;?!
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: and converting the tree bitmask to an array index
 UndercoverToad: I havereturn IdReverse[BitOperations.TrailingZeroCount((ulong)mask)];
 UndercoverToad: not completely happy with it
 UndercoverToad: and i should prune my move generator
 UndercoverToad: no seeding on day 20
 Gagat: IdReverse&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: static array
 Tiramon: ok now i have to fix the algo how i sim and eval that ... current one is crap
 UndercoverToad: my bitboard uses other IDs than the CG IDs so I have to convert
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/FgBBsgb">https://imgur.com/a/FgBBsgb</a>
 Gagat: right, same here then
 Gagat: Not exactly the same ids
 Gagat: Oh I like your ids
 Gagat: Shift is going to be more simple than mine
 UndercoverToad: what did you do differently? no padding at the edge?
 Gagat: Except for boundaries
 UndercoverToad: oh :D
 Gagat: Guess i'll stick with mine, don't want to bother with boundaries
 UndercoverToad: it's just an AND-operation to remove those bits outside of the board
 Gagat: I have ids from 0 to 37
 Gagat: just from the top left to the bottom right, line by line
 UndercoverToad: i see, that's a big difference
 Gagat: I'm thinking about the shifts for the shadows
 Gagat: oh right, no you have no problems
 Gagat: Don't need boundaries on both sides
 actualCoderTrevor: UndercoverToad is that a visualization you normally see or did you make that fpr illustrative purposes? I'm just curious.
 UndercoverToad: there is a debug view in the game itself
 actualCoderTrevor: I mean the ids
 UndercoverToad: and the red numbers are my kolourpaint skills
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh okay thanks&#160;:)
 Marchete: BitOperations.TrailingZeroCount or 			System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Bmi1.TrailingZeroCount
 Marchete:&#160;?
 Marchete: I'm using directly intrinsics
 Marchete: Bmi1.X64.TrailingZeroCount(counter);
 Marchete: sorry
 UndercoverToad: is there any difference?
 Marchete: yes
 UndercoverToad: oh, thanks :D
 Marchete: I'm explicitly saying Bmi1.X64
 Marchete: BitOperations.TrailingZeroCount can be more general
 Marchete: mine crashes is you don't have Bmi1 capable
 UndercoverToad: i guess same goes for popcount
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: Popcnt.X64.PopCount
 Marchete: .net 3.1 has a lot of new stuff

 NotSureWhyThisWorks: 3 people in top 5 with python bots. What type of algos can make it top 10 with python?
 jacek: ifletons
 Marchete: there is also a MethodImplOptions.AggressiveOptimization decorator
 Marchete: I need to check it
 Marchete: typescript on top10 too, nice
 resty-daze: NotSureWhyThisWorks my bot just greedy, not even consider next turn in the same day
 UndercoverToad: hm, so far I only knew about AggressiveInlining
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: resty-daze that's awesome for rank 9
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: also how do you tag people
 Marchete: so no simulation resty-daze?
 jacek: NotSureWhyThisWorks what do you mean
 resty-daze: Marchete ye no simulation
 Marchete: wow, nice eval :D
 UndercoverToad: jacek trolling again :D
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl what do you mean
 jacek: Automaton2000 how do you write in red
 Automaton2000: that last bit triggers me, oh well.
 Marchete: any good idea to apply seed masks to each cell?
 Marchete: having a mask per cell and size seems too big
 Illedan: Morning
 Marchete: I have freespaces, cell ID, tree size
 Marchete: i need some seedmask[size][ID]
 Marchete: but 37*3 ...
 Nerchio: why is it too big?
 Nerchio: you don't really keep it in the state right
 KaizenGTD: hi
 UndercoverToad: to fit in the processor cache
 KaizenGTD: what is the criteria to promote to next league?
 UndercoverToad: rank above the boss at 100% submit progress
 Tiramon: get a stable rank better than the boss
 UndercoverToad: at the moment bronze is the highest, silver on Monday
 KaizenGTD: how can I see where is the boss? I don't see anything in the ranking
 UndercoverToad: which league?
 Nerchio: ok i thought about the cache but i dont see the need for such optimization atm
 UndercoverToad: in wood the boss is at the top of the league
 KaizenGTD: I'm in Bronze League
 UndercoverToad: then there is no boss
 Tiramon: as he said a few lines before&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: UndercoverToad 11:04AMat the moment bronze is the highest, silver on Monday
 jacek: UndercoverToad 11:05AMUndercoverToad 11:04AMat the moment bronze is the highest, silver on Monday
 KaizenGTD: ok, understood, thank you!!
 UndercoverToad: An unhandled exception of type 'System.PlatformNotSupportedException' occurred in System.Private.CoreLib.dll: 'Operation is not supported on this platform.'
 UndercoverToad: my PC is old Marchete
 KaizenGTD: That sounds too bad
 Marchete: :rolf:
 Marchete: :rofl:
 Marchete: then it's working as intended
 Marchete: that's good
 dbdr: so old as not to have ctlz??
 AntiSquid: what is your real max turn time in ms&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: from 2011 or 2012, not sure anymore
 AntiSquid: seems to work for 95ms 
 UndercoverToad: i'm stopping at 20ms. no need to go further that early in the contest
 AntiSquid: i am stress testing so i don't get surprises later on 
 UndercoverToad: stress testing the servers?
 AntiSquid: both code and server i guess lol
 AntiSquid: NotSureWhyThisWorks numpy magic

 351062: Am I the only one experiencing random timeouts in the arena&#160;? Should I blame my code&#160;?
 Neumann: (cpp)
 AntiSquid: never in IDE&#160;? that's why i asked @_@
 Neumann: I meant IDE :D
 AntiSquid: what time limit did you set?
 Neumann: 85ms
 Neumann: We used to have timeout issues on optim games a while back, wondering if that's the same kind of issue
 AntiSquid: might be your code
 Neumann: Probably yeah
 AntiSquid: i can go to 95
 pmor: a few contests ago I ahd that problem...ended up being due to taking too much memory
 pmor: looked like a timeout
 Nagatwin: I can go up to 99ms
 Nagatwin: with a straight goto print at time limit 
 Tiramon: damn simulating in the early game is really hard ...
 cegprakash: Bronze too crowded
 jrke: yup 4000+ in bronze
 cegprakash: 200 in wood2, 400 in wood1 and 4000 in Bronze
 peerdb: what time does silver open on monday?
 StyllyMyle: Gys
 Jo4: what are you guys thought on having the premade stubs for a CoC not be the correct datatype?
 DetoBot: why not open the Silver tomorrow
 StyllyMyle: I am worried about the time taking for my program
 Jo4: just did one where the input is read as int, but must be read as a long. No test case checks for this, only a validator
 StyllyMyle: like i am trying to make bot but it requires me around 3-4 times looping possible actions
 Michael_Howard: OK, so this is super-weird. I agree with this bug report: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-bugs-questions/190526/28">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-bugs-questions/190526/28</a> and can see it myself, but my shadow code agrees with the ref.
 UndercoverToad: do you have a replay on that Michael_Howard?
 Tiramon: isn't that just a after grow shadows are not recalculated?
 Michael_Howard: How do I do that?
 UndercoverToad: click the 3 dots below the viewer

 Michael_Howard: Turn 80
 Michael_Howard: Top
 UndercoverToad: only the beginning of the day matters
 Michael_Howard: There's one place where shadows count down 3-2-1
 UndercoverToad: you grew the tree after
 Michael_Howard: Ah
 Michael_Howard: Thanks
 Marchete: beggining of the day?
 Tiramon: as i said shaodws are not recalculated after you grow a tree
 Marchete: so shadows are calc'ed at start of the day only?
 UndercoverToad: so who replies on the forum post?
 Tiramon: yes ... only moment they are important
 Michael_Howard: I can do it.
 Marchete: day and not turn, right?
 UndercoverToad: day
 Tiramon: i wrote a compact answer toady
 Michael_Howard: Actually I wanna investigate first &amp; check I understand it. If someone wants to post earlier they're welcome to use my replay.
 UndercoverToad: thanks, then i don't have to use my other account or write with this alias on the forum
 Michael_Howard: Why don't you want to do that?

 GuillaumeBardy: d
 GuillaumeBardy: thanks&#160;!

 Donald_D._Doge: entire site works faster without mod status
 jacek: yeah, get rid of mods. who needs them
 peerdb: modCheck
 Illedan: I'll kick myself then?
 Passifi: If you kick yourself in the butt I give you 5 € 
 AntiSquid: you can use your heel if you are flexible enough
 peerdb: yeah heel is ez money
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: rank keeps going up, are people submitting worse bots?
 Tiramon: hm i don't generate complete actions .. maybe thats the reason why i loose all games with that bot =)
 Marchete: on purpose?
 Passifi: btw nerds does anyone know how linkedin knows the people I have met in real life&#160;? It always scares me, those aren't my facebook friends and I am not connected to anyone on linkedin so how do they know that I worked with this random dude at a bar 4 years back...
 struct: yeah i submited my worse version 
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I can't tell if you are joking struct
 JoKing: i hate this chat
 jacek: Oo
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lmao

 JoKing: i'm *not*, it just tells me i have a message while i'm doing other stuff

 JoKing: yup, dumb system
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: interesting
 AntiSquid: is joKing a JoJo reference?

 GeorgiD: Can anyone check the previous examples I sent? It was in my reverse mode lobby and no one got it right
 AntiSquid: not the time to share contest code .
 AntiSquid: unless it's bits

 dreadylein: are you allowed to tell us howmuch you decreased your bots performance vs the full thing&#160;?&#160;:)
 Sakisan: ^
 struct: hard to say

 struct: i only bmade this eval the day before the contest
 struct: my other bots were worse
 dreadylein: yeah building a good eval seems hard
 struct: This one had like 95% win rate vs my other bots
 dreadylein: hehe
 struct: It might be good if I take into account enemy actions
 dreadylein: that was a beamsearch you said right&#160;?
 struct: yes
 dreadylein: wonder howmuch of an actual hit your bot took by decreasing the time :D depth helps but with a beamsearch and ignoring the opponent the benefit of deeper nodes should decrease fast i guess

 HIRO15254: but if I use it, printed this massage and I can't get input: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 HIRO15254: Is there anyone same as me?(Sorry I'm Japanese so the English may not good)
 itzluku: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 itzluku: u need to set that param
 itzluku: for ur debug prints
 itzluku: also documented as a comment in your default codefile
 HIRO15254: Ok, I'll try it
 StyllyMyle: btw anyone that understood how to traverse and get distance between two cells?
 dreadylein: for the contest&#160;?
 Uemu-yazid: Bruh I really can't grasp how to use shadows in this contest 
 dreadylein: what you mean&#160;? hehe
 Uemu-yazid: I didn't use that yet haha
 MattLGX: For the distance, you can say 1 for the neighbours ans 2 for the neighbours of the neighbours that are not in the distance = 1 list
 dreadylein: you an also look in the refree
 dreadylein: in the game description is a link to the github repo
 Uemu-yazid: Oh
 dreadylein: CubeCoord has the implementation that calculates distance neighbours etc
 Marchete: yeah, you need CubeCoord to go beyond neighbour distance 1
 itzluku: what do u mean with neighbor distance?
 StyllyMyle: I still cant get how to figure out cells
 Marchete: I mean shadow related
 StyllyMyle: guess i will just be using surrounding cells? but that makes things very complicated
 Marchete: you maybe want to calc if you have a tree at distance 2 that can block you
 Chainman: what is the CubeCoord?
 StyllyMyle: what is x y z in CubeCoord?

 Chainman: You can compute distance by creating a graph with the neighbor nodes for each node.
 Chainman: IDK that's what I did
 dreadylein: You can describe any cell in a hexfield with 3 cordinates
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/1dac6d0019d55890326edb25b2540df4b6a41179/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/BoardGenerator.java#L20-L43">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2021/blob/1dac6d0019d55890326edb25b2540df4b6a41179/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/BoardGenerator.java#L20-L43</a>
 itzluku: ah
 Marchete: center is 0,0,0
 Marchete: other than that you can "propagate" using
 DetoBot: can be considered as a cone
 itzluku: yeh u can travel through sun_directions to neighbors and return that info
 Marchete:  coord = coord.neighbor(direction);
 itzluku: since each cell hold the next index for a given sun dir
 itzluku: sun dir and neighbor index are the same
 StyllyMyle: so you mean enforcing custom coords system r8?
 StyllyMyle: by taking three axes and propagating
 itzluku: no need imo
 StyllyMyle: then mapping the coords?
 itzluku: but u need your own model if u want to simulate boards
 StyllyMyle: I cant get how x y z can be mapped to a 2d matrix

 Marchete: from a modified starter C# bot
 Chainman: I'm not sure how this CubeCord helps for the code in ide.  
 dreadylein: cords allow for easier time to get distances between 2 cells etc
 alchemsti: @stylleyMyle -- the reason is that for the hexes, xyz aren't independent -- taking one step in both x and z is the same as a single in y
 alchemsti: But for distances xyz is convenient
 Chainman: You can use the hashcode to convert cellIndex -&gt; CubeCoords (x,y,z)
 franciszer: mcst
 franciszer: monte
 itzluku: xD i have a probellm were a var randomly transforms from an int to a bool value
 itzluku: wtf
 alchemsti: The CubeCoord is giving a nice way to do the various geometric calculations
 Wontonimo: wow, sleep for a few hours and my rank doubles, in a bad way
 itzluku: problem*
 Marchete: CELL 8 Tree Size:1: [20,21,9,2,1,7,CELL 8 Tree Size:2: [20,21,9,2,1,7,23,3,6,36,CELL 8 Size:3: [20,21,9,2,1,7,23,3,6,36,12,16,
 alchemsti: "One weird trick to drop your rank by 200 places"
 Wontonimo: lol
 alchemsti: Do nothing for a few hours
 itzluku: my rank increases with time
 itzluku: LOL
 dreadylein: @franciszer possible but most likely not the best call
 Chainman: hmmmm
 Marchete: right now top100 is doable without game simulation
 itzluku: prob top40
 Marchete: just the starter AI and checking neighbours and stuff
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: for what my bot did
 StyllyMyle: btw
 Wontonimo: i didn't use the starter AI
 StyllyMyle: at higher leagues should we still have possible actions?
 Marchete: yes
 itzluku: starter AI&#160;?
 dreadylein: game wont change after bronze
 alchemsti: Looking at the CubeCoord and board generation code was helpful, e.g. I was always a bit worried the cell ID layout might change.
 StyllyMyle: that kinda feel cheat to me as it simplifies a lot of things
 alchemsti: But it seems fixed.
 Marchete: cell id doesn't change
 Wontonimo: itzluku there is a link at the very beginning of the description
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Marchete top 20 is doable without simulation right now
 Wontonimo: called "starter kit"
 dreadylein: the possible actions are a convinience thing to help out people 
 Marchete: thanks NotSureWhyThisWorks :D
 dreadylein: otherwise you exclude anyone thats not able to fully implement the engine
 Donald_D._Doge: hi, new here, what are the new silver rules?
 Tiramon: bronze is final ruleset
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: hopefully it stays like that lol
 alchemsti: re simulation or not -- that seems a fake choice, in that if you can evaluate a board 'perfectly' you don't need any simulation
 dreadylein: define evalute&#160;;)
 alchemsti: So it's kind of a trade-off -- do you invest in simulating quickly and going deep, or evaluating well
 alchemsti: I find the simulation in this one is pretty tricky (with sun, shading, and opponent action) that I'm not so motivated.
 dreadylein: the engine is easier then it looks at first&#160;:)
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: there aren't many short term tactics in this game unlike chess or something so I think long term strategy is most important. And that can be done lots of ways
 alchemsti: By evaluating I mean judging the result of a move -
 Wontonimo: dreadylein are you simulating days or moves?
 alchemsti: so you pick the 'best' one
 Wontonimo: alchemsti and dreadylein&#160;: I would say evaluation would be "will this lead to a win"
 alchemsti: right!
 alchemsti: This game has really interesting time aspects, IMO
 dreadylein: if you have a perfect evaluation, yeah you wouldnt need a search, but only if the evaluation allready considers any possible enemey move
 alchemsti: There is the balance between expansion and harvest
 Wontonimo: if it was chess, advancing all pawns 1 square then repeating that 4 more times will not lead to a win ... for exampl
 Wontonimo: what alchemsti said
 Marchete: imo all the game is resumed as
 Marchete: mysun-enemysun
 alchemsti: Depending on what your opponent does, of course :D
 alchemsti: (advancing your pawn could win, but is unlikely to)
 Marchete: mysun as collected sun
 alchemsti: resumed?
 Wontonimo: i don't take into account what my opponent does, so therefore you can get into the top 50 without paying attention to the opponent
 dreadylein: oh i can see this
 alchemsti: Do you care where your opponent is?
 dreadylein: also the main algos choosen are kind hard to implement with enemy moves
 Zaphus: @Wontonimo same here (but not qutie in the top 50)
 alchemsti: I'm currently ignoring the opponent as well (but also not top 50 :D )
 StyllyMyle: Hey im so much thankful to the post
 Wontonimo: alchemsti you can't place where a tree already exists, but otehr than that i don't 
 StyllyMyle: it finally made me understand that hex grids can be rep as xyz cube
 dreadylein:&#160;:)
 StyllyMyle: but is there any formula to convert the single index to xyz pos and vice versa?
 Wontonimo: cool Zaphus, we will battle to the death
 StyllyMyle: or should i statically map each and every pos with respective xyz
 alchemsti: Huh, interesting. My planned next step is going to take opponent position into account
 alchemsti: @StyllyMyle the code on GitHub does a nice trick so you don't need to convert
 Zaphus: Wontonimo - or go down in flames together!
 StyllyMyle: alchemsti CubeCoords? but it doesnt have conversion function right
 Wontonimo: in other hex games i cast it to squares with a 1/2 shift per line and then one diagonal is not allowed.  same effect and way easier to calculate
 Marchete: map from center
 alchemsti: Instead of using the obvious directions of [1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1] [-1 , 0 0]
 Marchete: center in 0,0,0
 Marchete: then according what they gave you
 itzluku: sdjfahgsdif
 Marchete: center.neighbour[i]
 alchemsti: it uses [1, -1, 0] 
 itzluku: just searching bugs
 StyllyMyle: Hm wait that might be it
 alchemsti: This lets you do nice distance and direction calculations
 itzluku: how can an int randoms become a bool
 StyllyMyle: I know my 6 neigbours
 StyllyMyle: and the xyz coord of center one
 alchemsti: @itzluku: the joys of untyped languages?
 StyllyMyle: plus those six must be arranged in array or something
 alchemsti: Or it's treated as a bool (!! or&#160;!= 0 or...)
 itzluku: @alchemsti yeh.. using python to learn it
 alchemsti: Those six are the six directions
 itzluku: but i just dont find the type switch
 StyllyMyle: so if i could calculate relative pos of these neighbours, i can +-1 in respetive direction to get a cube grid r8?
 itzluku: qq
 alchemsti: If you draw it on paper, you'll see
 StyllyMyle: wtf im so noob&#160;:(
 alchemsti: Ha, I hadn't seen it before iether. But it's the six directions expressed so that the math to do distance is easier
 Wontonimo: you are given a neighbours list in the init, and the neigh_1, neigh_2, etc are always the same directions.  The first is always to the right, second is northeast.  So if you want to calculate a straight line of 3 squares, just iteratively look up the same ordinal neighbour
 Wontonimo: great for if/else bot, horrible efficiency for simulation
 alchemsti: @itzluku My understanding is the Python figures out type from how its used. (type inference) If you want to narrow it down, you can try doing things like adding zero to it -- this should be okay for numbers and not okay for booleans.
 alchemsti: But don't quote me, I don't use Python that much
 Marchete: just be cautious
 Marchete: neighbour list has -1 if it's not a legal neighbour
 Marchete: so just skip there -1
 Marchete: these*
 alchemsti: yeah, hit that, using c++, which will happily look up a value at -1 of an array&#160;:/
 alchemsti: All right good luck folks!
 itzluku: well i use a print statement in a loop... and for the first iteration it prints an int and then on a bool
 itzluku: xd
 itzluku: no idea
 itzluku: lol
 Michael_Howard: Why is everyone worrying about xyz-coord hex grids when only the neighbour chain in each direction affects anything? Am I missing something?
 itzluku: na i would also just traverse through neighbor cells with a depth
 itzluku: btw i serialised 0 and 1 for is_mine to bool values somewhere so i have cells with -1 or True or False
 itzluku: ..............
 itzluku: why did i do that :D
 alchemsti: Michael_Howard: shade
 alchemsti: Good ole' trinary logic
 alchemsti: (for itzluku -- search for 'true false file not found')
 Michael_Howard: alchamesti yeah, only in the neighbour chain, which you can get easy.
 Michael_Howard: Was wondering if everyone's doing advanced battlefield tactics where distance matters between cells that can't spook each-other.
 itzluku: or wait
 itzluku: is str(0)=False in python&#160;???
 itzluku: and str(1)=True
 jacek: no
 jacek: str(0) is "0"
 jacek: and its not False
 itzluku:&#160;:/
 itzluku: hm
 alchemsti: I'm currently only using distance to check what I can seed, but i'm also only at place ~300 
 itzluku: maybe is_mine input is not 0 and 1 but a bool value if that index is owned by anyone?
 itzluku: idk i thought its -1,1 or 0
 itzluku: but maybe its -1 True or False
 itzluku:&#160;?
 jacek: is_mine = inputs[2]&#160;!= "0"
 itzluku: WTF
 itzluku: fk me
 itzluku: ty! xd
 Zaphus: Wontonimo - we meet at last <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549037639">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549037639</a>
 Wontonimo: i bow to your greatness
 Zaphus: :joy:
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 Chainman: How do you get them to say things in the replay? lol
 why_anonymous: allo
 algeo: space + command
 Wontonimo: instead of returning "WAIT", return "WAIT i will taunt you a second time"
 xangma: Dumb question, when it says: "As long as you have enough sun points, you can take any number of actions." what does that mean specifically?
 xangma: any of the 4 possible types?
 xangma: any number of any type?
 Thienu: you can take any number of any type of turn in a day
 Zaphus: whatever you want - before you wait
 xangma: Right ok, thanks
 xangma: very much
 Zaphus: but on separate game ticks (or whatever you call it)
 Thienu: yes
 Wontonimo: right
 xangma: separate says?
 xangma: days*
 Wontonimo: no, the day only progresses once both players wait
 Zaphus: some other games let you do "ACTION 1; ACTION 2; ACTION 3; WAIT" as a single response.  This game only takes one action per loop
 itzluku: its turn based
 itzluku: in bronze u can make multiple actions per day
 itzluku: war u in wood?
 itzluku: are*
 algeo: not at same time
 xangma: hmmmm I'm in bronze, as soon as I start doing more than one action per day it starts saying I'm out of sync
 Zaphus: a loop is not a day, dont mix the two up
 xangma: OH
 Wontonimo: just one action per turn
 algeo: some turns = day
 Wontonimo: the day doesn't roll over until you wait
 xangma: OH I get it now
 xangma: Right thanks
 Wontonimo: it took me a while also tbh
 xangma: Thanks very much
 itzluku: jesus
 itzluku: another bug because i compared a str with an int prepresentation
 itzluku: ....
 dreadylein: you can precalcutelate any possible shading/seeding in advance
 dreadylein: woops
 CGGCoder: Just a quick question, what does a 'Dormant Tree' mean?
 martinpapa69: what can you precalculate in seeding&#160;?
 Marchete: thx for the tip dreadylein :D
 Machinist: Hi Everyone.
 Machinist: Have a good day
 dreadylein: woops was for the late response chat was way scrolled up
 dreadylein: :D
 dbf: CGGCoder, from rules page: "Any tree impacted by one of your actions becomes dormant for the rest of the day. A dormant tree cannot be the subject of an action. "
 CGGCoder: Thanks!
 dbf: so it is a cooldown
 itzluku: yes
 itzluku: -&gt;day24 growing a t2 to a t3 not worth
 CGGCoder: true
 CGGCoder: You should harvest all of the remaining trees
 itzluku: is is_mine not getting updated for every turn?
 itzluku: only initial?
 ddreams: what would make you think that?
 Wontonimo: it gets updated every turn
 itzluku: i haven an index with 0 but that cell was completed from my opp some turns before
 itzluku: meaning it wasnt updated or i overriden the updated cell somehow
 Zaphus: Cells dont get updated, only trees - and if completed you just dont get a message about it next turn meaning it is not there
 itzluku: is_mine = inputs[2]
 itzluku: it does get updated every turn
 Zaphus: but only for trees that exist at that turn
 itzluku: oh
 itzluku: hm
 Zaphus: clear your cells of tree information between turns, then refresh it when loading (thats what I do)
 Zaphus: but dont clear other cell info like neighbours
 itzluku: yes ill try that, ty!
 itzluku: sneaky
 alchemsti: Yeah, I'm not sure if I have it in it's final form, but it took a bit of tweaking to nicely separate out the fixed stuff from the changing
 VizGhar: how deep your searches are guys
 VizGhar:&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: 1
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ItsNotABug: 0
 VizGhar: noice :D
 ZarthaxX: not doing the beam yet tho
 Thienu: spent whole day implementing simulation here
 ItsNotABug: Does silver open today or tomorrow?
 VizGhar: I hopped into it in Dart lang and it was freaking mistake
 VizGhar: now I'm reworking it into C++... never ever competitive dart
 Wontonimo: Thienu woot!  how's the sim going?
 cloudberry:  
 ZarthaxX: saw that dart took a lot for a bfs
 Thienu: painful hahaha
 Wontonimo: VizGhar , my search is 0 depth
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: its technically depth 1..
 VizGhar: So you are that if-else guy? :P
 ZarthaxX: the one and only wonto
 Wontonimo: no, i prefer sim just haven't got around to it for this competition
 ZarthaxX: you can stay with if else
 Wontonimo: i'm thinking my first sim implementation will be beam or DFS using my current if/else as the opponent logic
 ZarthaxX: that's perfect :P
 Marchete: that's a good idea
 Marchete: ignoring enemy seems strange in this game
 BlaiseEbuth: Zarthouuuuuuuu! Where's ze bear?
 Wontonimo: well, it's an idea at least.  it has the potential to try and overfit beating my if/else but the benefit of being fast for the opponent side of th calculation.  I'll let you know how it goes
 ZarthaxX: python n1 again
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth oh man wait a sec :P
 Wontonimo: i'll port to c++
 ZarthaxX: gl&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: haha , how is python N1&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: if else is strong
 Wontonimo: yeah, for sure
 ZarthaxX: BlaiseEbuth bear mode on
 BlaiseEbuth: Yéé!
 BlaiseEbuth: I reload
 Noyotens: someone know how to get neighbors rishness
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: Noyotens save the data somewhere?
 Noyotens: plz guys tell me how
 BlaiseEbuth: Spy them
 ZarthaxX: you got it on input
 ZarthaxX: lol
 VizGhar: ri what?
 Wontonimo: yeah, Oioi (n1) bot returns in about the same time as my bot, so it doesn't seem to be doing much sim if it is
 ZarthaxX: richness VizGhar
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo how do you know?
 Noyotens: lol
 ZarthaxX: the return time :P
 Wontonimo: ZarthaxX I don't know it exactly, but in by selecting that bot as an opponent and running a few "Play my code" and using wall clock, it has the same wall clock as pitting my bot against itself.
 Wontonimo: if it used all its compute resources then it would have used 1000ms + 100ms*127turns = a lot of seconds
 Wontonimo: around 13 seconds
 Wontonimo: but it returned in about 3
 ZarthaxX: ahh ok
 Oioi: Wontonimo&#160;: right, only heuristic right now
 ZarthaxX: what a god
 ZarthaxX: gz Oioi
 Wontonimo: HEY Oioi&#160;!

 VizGhar: oioioi&#160;:) whats going on struc t?
 VizGhar: at least you are not below 1k like me
 struct: yeah, but I probably spent a lot more time on it 
 VizGhar: i dont think so... wrote it in dart and trown it away... so i'm starting over
 struct: I tested the contest though
 Chainman: hey :grin:
 ZarthaxX: struct harder without opps
 Chainman: if else to the top I guess here
 struct: I will soon take revenge on all these if elses
 Chainman: with else if?

 Wontonimo: no one can hear you on ssh, it's secure sh 
 Astrobytes: I thought that was the joke&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: algeo i haven't seen a board yet where the center isn't the richest.  but regardless, that info is provided as input to your bot
 algeo: ok
 Wontonimo: i'm slow Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 BlaiseEbuth: Wooooonntooooooniiiiiiiisloooowwww
 Wontonimo: think slow, type fast.  not a great combo on my work chat

 Astrobytes: Gotta say, I'm struggling to find the motivation to do anything
 ClockSort: awesome, more than 4k players in Bronze now
 ClockSort: it's time to write some code.
 Michael_Howard: How can I print something that will let me match console output to game screen? Can't just turn++ because don't get input when sleep.
 Michael_Howard: Sometimes when it's halfway between it can get confusing which console output is for which video frame.
 RoboStac: you can display messages on screen by putting them after your action (eg "COMPLETE 3 HELLO")  - you could display your turn variable there so it matches between console and screen
 Michael_Howard: Yeah I'm doing that, hoped there was a better way. OK, thanks&#160;:)
 algeo: i won every match in wood2 now with the same code without running in this league i am 15 :o
 ClockSort: you'll probably drop
 algeo:&#160;:\ lol
 algeo: WAIT command is not useful in every league&#160;?
 ItsNotABug: beating wood 2 is like beating a new born baby at tennis
 algeo: for a new born baby it is like ..
 jacek: oO
 itzluku: xD
 itzluku: my bot is worse if i consider shadows
 slamo: how do you print debug text in go?
 RoboStac: fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Debug messages...")
 slamo: thank you!!
 ItsNotABug: Consider shadows less?
 algeo: dormant tree = size 3&#160;?
 itzluku: no
 algeo: oh
 ItsNotABug: dormant is if its been used, or newly planted
 algeo: oh ok
 itzluku: used "that day"
 itzluku: gets non dormant again next day
 algeo: :thumbsup:
 itzluku: lul now my bot won
 itzluku: i only consider 1/3 of the remaining days

 GrekMaR: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0699feb0-6e30-4aea-ab83-cc16097bd934">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0699feb0-6e30-4aea-ab83-cc16097bd934</a>
 GrekMaR: ^ Anyone who does java code golf who knows how to shorten boilerplate code?
 KelvinAndHubbles: get rid of spacing and put it on one line?
 GrekMaR: ofc i do that when golfing, this is just for visibility I do spacing and lines ^^
 KelvinAndHubbles: ahh, only other thing I do is change the variable name of the scanner to one char instead of two
 KelvinAndHubbles: you can also replace the interface with class to shorten it more, unless your going for an interface
 GrekMaR: using interface is actually shorter cause else main class needs to be public to compile&#160;:)
 GrekMaR: but yes var name of scanner
 KelvinAndHubbles: ahh, wow thanks shortening my golf codes :D
 GrekMaR: haha cheers,
 algeo: promoted to bronze&#160;:)
 algeo: if i play invalid move i lost points&#160;?
 MoMaT: you loose the game.
 algeo: :o i got 20 point but now it is a dash -
 itzluku: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549221278">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549221278</a>
 itzluku: xDDDD
 algeo: :D
 n4ou3r: xD
 algeo: 10 / 3
 algeo: that 3
 itzluku: true
 itzluku: rematch!
 itzluku: :D
 algeo:&#160;:)
 cegprakash: anyone doing topcoder SRM?
 algeo: i need some seach algorithm for bronze&#160;:\
 KelvinAndHubbles: GrekMaR you might already know this one too, but change your System.out.println to System.out.print cuts off 2 characters per print
 GrekMaR: KelvinAndHubbles ty actualy didn't think about that one&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: nope ceg. but codejam next week
 AntiSquid: this seeding business is annoying @_@
 itzluku: most games i lose have like a 10pt diff
 algeo: :c
 itzluku: -.-
 BenjaminUrquhart: Welp good luck to people, came on just to check out this contest and I don't really find it that interesting
 itzluku: euler got a weird strat
 itzluku: spamm t3 trees on richness 1 cells
 itzluku: and it works
 itzluku: xD
 UndercoverToad: i don't include richness in my scoring yet :D
 itzluku: xD
 itzluku: #?
 algeo: when it is good to use seed&#160;? when we have 1 tree left 
 itzluku: ifu want more trees&#160;?:D
 algeo: xd
 UndercoverToad: when the seed is free (no other seed of yours on the map) is already a good time
 itzluku: more trees more suns more points
 jacek: is fluttershy a tree
 DevLorenzo: Hi have a question with the Defibrillators small game
 algeo: yes please
 DevLorenzo: I have a code that works for the first and last example, but not second and third
 DevLorenzo: I don't know why
 algeo: share code :p
 DevLorenzo: here the code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ae804f0b-9c16-4c58-9120-9be5ac27cc08">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ae804f0b-9c16-4c58-9120-9be5ac27cc08</a>
 UndercoverToad: do you convert from degree to raidans?
 algeo: oh that maybe it is wrong
 UndercoverToad: would be a classic, a lot of users get the wrong
 DevLorenzo: Thx
 DevLorenzo: i try
 Smelty: does a land lose fertility after you complete a tree on it
 UndercoverToad: no
 Smelty: ok
 DevLorenzo: So I should convert to user longitude 
 UndercoverToad: yes, sin and cos expect radians
 Smelty: thanks btw
 Rag: maybe its better to use t1 cells since shadow blocks you less overall? going for t3 cells is risky i guess
 itzluku: u will get less gold in the early game
 Smelty: meh my strat is to use outside for sun and inside for nutrient
 itzluku: its a tradeoff
 UndercoverToad: that makes it easier for the opponent to shadow you
 itzluku: might be worth to go for a hybrid
 itzluku:&#160;:)
 itzluku: depends on the day
 Smelty: hmmm\
 Smelty: game gets more and more strategic the more you look at it
 DevLorenzo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16ae4b40-090c-4bdf-a1b5-05fcd7fc9e4e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16ae4b40-090c-4bdf-a1b5-05fcd7fc9e4e</a>
 DevLorenzo: Continue to have an error. I have a wrong output with second and third. 
 Smelty: weird.
 DevLorenzo: Other ideas? 
 algeo: wrong substring
 algeo: spitting is wrong i think
 Smelty: hm
 algeo:&#160;;; is not in everything
 DevLorenzo: Sorry for the inconvenience but I've been there for like 1h
 itzluku: won against euler, rank 69 is mine :D
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: my goal is 420, no way im making it there
 itzluku: u got this
 itzluku: just weight neighbors for your seed spots
 itzluku: if u can make a knight structure u are good to go
 VizGhar: where is dbd r?
 Smelty: whaaaT
 Smelty: mr wonton told me to go knight
 Smelty: but it crashed&#160;:(
 itzluku: order possible seed options by nr of opponents and nr of own trees surrounding that spot, its important to have as little aligning team trees as possible
 itzluku: imo
 Smelty: wow
 dbdr: VizGhar in submit...
 VizGhar: :P
 VizGhar: I simply want to see someone from top 50 implementing their solution... I simply can't take it easy
 VizGhar: (don't know what incremental steps mean)
 dbdr: there are some streams
 dbdr: recurse did one for locam for instance
 jrke: will recurse again do one submit legend?
 VizGhar: Have to carefully look at it&#160;:) I mean... i'll most probably get to top 500 but can't see any way further
 VizGhar: will recurse come?&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: DevLorenzo your input parsing has problems
 jrke: he came last time when legend opened and he made legend with just one submit from wood
 itzluku: top80 73% :o
 UndercoverToad: you check for ";;" but sometimes there is a text between these two&#160;;
 DevLorenzo: Thank, I already solved thanks to Algeo
 UndercoverToad: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 dbdr: what's up UndercoverToad?
 UndercoverToad: you are up
 UndercoverToad: i'm down around 50
 VizGhar: noice
 itzluku: i cant find u UndercoverToad :o
 UndercoverToad: because that's an alt account
 dbdr: he's undercover though
 UndercoverToad: try to guess my real one
 jrke: dbdr did you applied any algo or just heuristic?
 itzluku: i mean there is no Toad
 dbdr: beam search jrke
 VizGhar: dbdr what depth can you reach?
 dbdr: :zipper_mouth:
 jrke: :grimacing:
 VizGhar: well... i tried
 VizGhar: I tried to befriend him and look... now I have to think myself
 VizGhar: and it hurts
 dbdr: I think, it was all strategy!
 dbdr: *I see
 struct: My nth_element was bugged
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 VizGhar: 666th
 ZarthaxX: struct nOOOOO
 struct: I had no idea that the second param was pointing to first param
 struct: or w/e it is
 struct: its confusing
 ZarthaxX: what
 struct: I hadnth_element(&amp;pool[start], &amp;pool[start] + BEAM_WIDTH - 1, &amp;pool[start + total], [&amp;](const GameState&amp; a, const GameState&amp; b) {	return a.evaluation &gt; b.evaluation;});
 ZarthaxX: second param is number of elements
 struct: nth_element(&amp;pool[start], &amp;pool[0] + BEAM_WIDTH - 1, &amp;pool[start + total], [&amp;](const GameState&amp; a, const GameState&amp; b) {	return a.evaluation &gt; b.evaluation;});
 ZarthaxX: i dont get your code
 struct: correct should be the 2nd
 DomiKo: template&lt; class RandomIt &gt;constexpr void nth_element( RandomIt first, RandomIt nth, RandomIt last );
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element</a>
 DomiKo: ZarthaxX second param isn't number of elements
 struct: yeah domiko but I had no idea it needed to start at [0] 
 struct: for w/e reason
 ZarthaxX: DomiKo but i saw examples where it was
 ZarthaxX: mmhmm
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdnth_element-in-cpp/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdnth_element-in-cpp/</a>
 ZarthaxX: first example shows trhat
 jrke: "Players that are asleep do not receive input." -  does this means that if you waited then you will get input in next day?
 DomiKo: jrke yes
 DomiKo: ZarthaxX no?
 VizGhar: One main problem that I have with my beam is, that I have to sort it every time beam size is exceeded (allways)Sort is really slow
 ZarthaxX: no? lol
 VizGhar: is there any way to surpass this?
 AntiSquid: that's the fog of war they snuck in jrke
 VizGhar: you guys implementing some weighted trees?
 struct: use nth_element VizGhar
 ZarthaxX: for first code he put the second arg as an iterator to the fifth element
 ZarthaxX: and then the sort put the first 5
 VizGhar: nth_element... hmm ill try to google a bit
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar its a partial sort
 ZarthaxX: so you get the first k elements sorted
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element</a>
 ZarthaxX: the first k elements
 RoboStac: yeah, but it's a iterator to the fifth element, not the number of elements. Passing 5 there would be really bad 
 ZarthaxX: i know
 ZarthaxX: but i meant iterator to the fifth lol
 DomiKo: so you get the first k elements sorted
 DomiKo: noooo
 ZarthaxX: isnt the second parameter the one that determines how many 
 RoboStac: yeah
 DomiKo: don't troll people ZarthaxX 
 DomiKo: first part won't be sorted
 MSmits: do they get sorted? I thought they just got put into any order above the nth element?
 ZarthaxX: im not trolling
 DomiKo: MSmits you are right
 ZarthaxX: im just experessing wrong
 ZarthaxX: lol
 struct: So which one is correct?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/bFOFBbu">https://tech.io/snippet/bFOFBbu</a>
 DaNinja: is it the same as partial_sort()?
 ZarthaxX: whatever
 struct: no DaNinja
 UndercoverToad: i'm memorize that what i don't want to admit that i was wrong. "I'm just expressing wrong"&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am wondering if i am using this correctly:
 MSmits:  std::nth_element(parents, parents + parentCount - 1, parents + BEAM_WIDTH, [](GS const&amp; a, GS const&amp; b) -&gt; bool{ return a.eval &gt; b.eval;});\
 ZarthaxX: lol toad
 MSmits: some how i needed to do -1 on the parent count in the second param
 struct: MSmits my problem is that on nth if i start on array[0]
 struct: it still works
 struct: Thats why im confused
 struct: like the second param
 MSmits: in my example, parents is an array too
 MSmits: and &amp;parents[0]  is the same as parents
 AntiSquid: UndercoverToad, more often used: "i think there's a misunderstanding / there's seems to be some misunderstanding / miscomunication"
 struct: ah I see
 MSmits: parnents + parentcount -1 is basically &amp;parents[last index]
 VizGhar: hmm so if I use that nth_element I'll get my nth_element in center and smaller on one size, larger on another right?
 DomiKo: yes
 MSmits: yeah VizGhar
 ZarthaxX: oh  so like the quicksort thing
 ZarthaxX: sorry D:
 VizGhar: this should work... Ok guys... just small steps... concentrate and breathe :D I'll make some stupid thing again
 itzluku: release the kraken
 MSmits: one iteration of quicksort,  except instead of knowing the value of the pivot element, you know the position where you want the pivot element to be
 ZarthaxX: right
 AntiSquid: itzluku now that you mention it, where is kalamariking&#160;? guess he is a bloody alt afterall @_@
 VizGhar: Oh... thanks MSmits, now i know exactly what it's doing
 MSmits: np, I still wondering if i am not off by 1 in my use though
 struct: Maybe ill change my beam search, there is no use in storing all states
 AntiSquid: oh he is on the leaderboard, nvm then
 MSmits: struct nah, dont store all states
 AntiSquid: gotta catch'em all
 MSmits: just the last level and whatever action it started with, for each state
 MSmits: you dont need to reproduce the entire path taken
 struct: I save the action in the state
 DomiKo: you can save id of action
 MSmits: i only save the first actuon taken in the state
 VizGhar: go MCTS what could possibly go wrong
 dbdr: the path can be useful for debugging though&#160;:)
 struct: yeah, I meant saved id in the state
 DomiKo: dbdr true
 MSmits: dbdr yeah and i guess i have plenty of room to actually save them
 AntiSquid: VizGhar early silver promotion?
 MSmits: btw, i am starting to think you need multiple algo's here
 MSmits: bs is great for start
 MSmits: but becomes less useful when shadows become more important
 MSmits: (opponent shadows)
 jrke: for what depth MS BS
 AntiSquid: people here love BS&#160;?
 MSmits: i dont know what depth is best
 solistice: guess I'm back for another challenge!
 MSmits: it's just a number, i can set it to play till end of game if i want to
 MSmits: BS has no depth limits 
 AntiSquid: wb solistice
 solistice: thx!
 solistice: been a while, trying to reach legend for once :D
 jrke: i am a bad optimizer so can't get a lot of nodes...
 solistice: if I find the time
 MSmits: you dont need a lot
 MSmits: just have to be smart about pruning and such
 [0_o]Surya: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c020da94-1439-4574-8d05-ba45c4add4c5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c020da94-1439-4574-8d05-ba45c4add4c5</a>
 solistice: @AntiSquid I remember there being plugins for codingame previously, to link with IDE and stuff.. Does that still exist?
 AntiSquid: yes somewhere
 AntiSquid: search forums for tools
 solistice: cool cool, will do!&#160;:)
 MSmits: I have a 20 depth bs that only takes 5 ms... it's jus tbad because of bad eval and pruning, optimization doesnt help and more beam width doesnt either
 VizGhar: click settings in CG IDE solistice
 VizGhar: at the bottom
 jrke: 20 in 5ms thats very gr8
 VizGhar: 20depth in 5ms? wtf? :D all bitwise operations and crazy pruning?
 Scarfield: beam width of 1? :p
 MSmits: some pruning yeah
 VizGhar: yeah... such a beamsearch is called hillclimb Scarfield
 VizGhar: (not exactly, but still...)
 MSmits: also very optimized i guess, but my point was that focusing on optimization is not a winning strategy here
 MSmits: and I didnt actually. This was just the easiest way for me to code it
 Scarfield: improved eval might change that though(?)
 MSmits: yeah maybe, but i watched a couple games from the top 10, saw what they did, translated it to pruning and went from rank 1800 to rank 300-400
 jrke: damn MS then if you coded hardly and optimized you will be doctor strange who saw all possible outcomes in infinity war
 MSmits: lol, and only 1 that is a win, and it's outside of the beam... too bad :P
 VizGhar: he's messing with us. come boys. we go home
 MSmits: mmh that's lucky, won first 10 games on new submit&#160;:)
 VizGhar: When you are talking about pruning. I understand it as removing nodes similar to another nodes (so exact copies but different path)
 MSmits: no, not in this case VizGhar
 VizGhar: so you are pruning before computation = dont seed from 2 trees
 VizGhar: on same place
 MSmits: pruning would be, for example: Not considering dropping a seed when there's already one. Or not growing another size 2 tree when you already have a bunch
 VizGhar: or sth like that
 MSmits: well i guess it's like compression, you have lossy compression and lossless compression
 MSmits: pruning that removes branches that are provably bad or redundant is lossless
 MSmits: but I was talking about lossy pruning 
 MSmits: removing branches that are very likely bad, but not 100%
 jrke: pruning can be COMPLETING only after D days
 VizGhar: ah... gotcha
 MSmits: right good one jrke
 MSmits: pretty sure most players have a rule like that
 MSmits: or it's more fluid, like it depends on the nutrients, the number of trees they already have etc.
 VizGhar: yeah... So what I'm doing currently is some early game hardcode (first 2-5 turns) then running simulation (single round=single depth) and all that pruning is done in my eval function... that is for sure slow
 AntiSquid: number of states explodes with seeds, what makes seed placement bad @_@
 VizGhar: I was too happy seeing that my simulation throws exactly the same "possible steps" as i was receiving in input
 struct: maybe I can add that pruning
 struct: Chuck to check how it changes
 davi_bart: Probably is written in the text but I can't find it, are my shadows spooky also for my trees? 
 struct: just*
 MSmits: davi_bart yeah
 davi_bart: ok thanks
 MSmits: you can shade your own trees
 VizGhar: just look at some replays davi_bart you will see it immediately
 MSmits: don't :poop:  where you eat. Don't shade, where you tree
 jrke: this game needs to have an good opponent interference + look at large depth
 VizGhar: oh sheat that was neat
 Murat_Eroglu: we cant see segmentation faults on game information screen, can we?
 AntiSquid: maybe i should drop everything when i have too many states?
 ClosetAI: I didn't realize at first that your own trees could shadow your other trees
 VizGhar: and now you are a bit smarter go go Closet
 jrke: finally i coded the game engine
 jrke: but not if its bug free
 jrke: not sure*
 jrke: will be discovered as i will see the replays after applying the sim
 ClosetAI: This engine is probably the easiest I had to code so far
 VizGhar: painful right jrke? MSmits told me it's simple
 Scarfield: i forgot about shadows not affecting smaller trees, luckily chat mentioned it
 VizGhar: i cried :D
 jacek: well he has experience with hex games
 ClosetAI: Just hardcode the stuff that you get in input
 jrke: he is a good, expierenced CS teacher so easy for him
 algeo: i lost my code&#160;:|
 algeo: oh it is there another tab
 VizGhar: :D
 algeo: :D
 VizGhar: if you submit it or at least play, it will be stored
 algeo: oh ok
 jrke: happened once with me few months ago i lost my all code and i had to rewrite that whole 430 lines&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: algeo you can use the "History" navigation on the left to see all your previous commits
 MSmits: wait... the sim is relatively simple compared to other games. I don't mean coding a sim in general is simple
 algeo: ok tnx
 jrke: we are also talking for this game MS
 VizGhar: we were talking about this game
 MSmits: yeah i know
 MSmits: compared to other games, i think this game has a simple sim
 Wontonimo: :wave: MSmits 
 jrke: its easy to code if you have full 100% concentration + every minute rule in your mind
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: 2 words will help greatly in writing your sim&#160;: unit tests
 MSmits: yeah, better than my method, which is  staring at the same code for hours until you see the bug
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b94fcb86-ae4b-4870-9728-d8bec12bc277">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b94fcb86-ae4b-4870-9728-d8bec12bc277</a>
 Scarfield: xD
 Wontonimo: :D
 MSmits: i did unit test action generations
 MSmits: never unit tested the sim states
 MSmits: probably should get on that
 jrke: wait you mean testing every node you get in sim?
 Wontonimo: another method of validating your sim is to use the previous board state and your and opponents actions and make sure it matches the new state every round, and DIE with a big warning when it does 
 RoboStac: it's really awkward to do that here though Wontonimo as they can have multiple turns when you wait
 MerryMentat: That approach is tricky because they don't give your opponent's moves.
 MSmits: also, you dont get your opponent action as input
 MSmits: MerryMentat beat me to it
 MerryMentat: But you can still do it
 Wontonimo: oh, right ... well you can do that up to and including your wait.  first action of new round is reset
 RoboStac: yeah, but you just generate all possible moves and test each of them to see if it matches new state
 MSmits: did you do that RoboStac?
 RoboStac: not here
 MerryMentat: I just built something that parses the game replay and replays it into my simulator
 jacek: you do that only in begining of contest to see if youe sim is alright
 MerryMentat: Because the game replay gives the opponent's moves.
 RoboStac: but I quite often have in the past
 MSmits: I think I am going to do what RoboStac suggests
 MerryMentat: You have to debug print out everything the game gives you, though.
 Wontonimo: yeah, you are all correct about it being hard for this particular game.  good point
 MerryMentat: Then you've got enough info to do it.
 RoboStac: most of my mcts games do it because it's helpful for mcts tree reuse too
 Westicles: does beam stack search ever apply to bot problems?
 jacek: btw. i found my another bug - i written each tre gives 1 sun point. but it gives tree.size points :F
 jrke: i will start from sim then i will change my algo after silver opening
 MSmits: Basically, just take the current state, generate all your opponent actions. Select an action of your own, make a list of all resulting game states from all combinations of your move and the opponents moves and compare them all with the input state of next turn
 Wontonimo: woot!  I found another if/else to improve my bot.
 MSmits: just dont do it when your action is wait
 RoboStac: yeah 
 RoboStac: sounds like it should work
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/549323860">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/549323860</a> my bot spams throw at a cell (move 65)
 MSmits: will do that then, thanks again RoboStac, great suggestion
 jacek: another approach - make muzero and screw all the rules. who nees rules anyway
 RoboStac: people without lots of memory / code space
 jrke: gn gtg want to have some sleep
 RoboStac: have you seen the input formats in muzero?!
 Wontonimo: haha icecream17 ... that's fun
 Wontonimo: gn jrke
 Wontonimo: wow, rank stabilization just raised me from 73 up to 67.  First i've seen my rank go up from stabilization.
 jacek: so stable
 Wontonimo: lol
 MerryMentat: What is stabilization?
 Wontonimo: after your last battle, the scoring alters your rank one last time 
 MerryMentat: Oh - I didn't realize there was a "last battle" - I'd assumed that it just kept having you battle over and over again
 jacek: when you lead in points for most of the game... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549331813">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549331813</a>
 Wontonimo: MerryMentat when you click "Test in Arena" your bot does about 96 battles of you vs others.  When others submit their bot, your bot may be one of their "others".  That's it.
 Wontonimo: the stabilization of your score happens after your 96 battles that you triggered with the "test in arena"
 MerryMentat: Ah!
 MerryMentat: 96 is a lot!
 MerryMentat: I didn't know that's how it works
 jacek: still more than community game :unamused:
 MSmits: doesn't really matter at this stage in the contest anyways
 Wontonimo: jacek that's a nice replay.  reminds me i havent addressed that problem happening accidentily in my bot
 struct: I think its time to turn on all the pcs in the house to bench
 UndercoverToad: how many do you have?
 jacek: thats why contests should be in winter
 struct: 5
 MSmits: he's even going to test his bot on his roomba
 struct: Can smart fridges run it?
 MSmits: try it
 MSmits: maybe it will grow branches
 Wontonimo: see if you can run it on your internet root-er 
 Wontonimo: was that too "dad" of me?
 MSmits: yeah, but it's ok&#160;:)
 jacek: ok fixing the bug yielded another 500 ranks up
 Wontonimo: :tada:
 itzluku: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549339967">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549339967</a>
 itzluku: not even close
 Thiesjoo: Hmmm there is no way to see where your code is timed out?
 struct: you need to download the replay
 MSmits: just to be clear, I never did that part. Some players here are proficient with downloading replays and automatically taking information from it
 MSmits: euler showed me some of that with python, but I suck at this
 Astrobytes: Am I the only one that finds this game completely unexciting?
 jacek:&#160;!!!!
 jacek: heresy
 CGGCoder: Nope
 jacek: how hex board game can be unexciting?
 MSmits: mmh it's ok in that regard for me, i just find it frustrating that my usual tricks dont give me a better ranking so far&#160;:)
 CGGCoder: It's complicated
 Astrobytes: I just find it completely boring.
 avdg: if reading is boring, it can be a factor
 Astrobytes: Eh?
 MSmits: well it's trees, they dont move
 JBM: hexagons? i barely noticed
 MSmits: same, the fact that it's hex doesnt matter
 avdg: otherwise its about getting excitement about maximalisation
 CGGCoder: How do you make it so that when you do all of your actions and a new day arrives, the 'for' statement restarts?
 JBM: they give each cell's neighbors, you don't have to do any crazy hex math if you don't want to
 Astrobytes: I told myself I would finish my sim today, but I only added a few lines. I cannot motivate myself.
 Wontonimo: we need explosions for Astrobytes
 struct: Should have played the tutorial 
 avdg: don't think too hard
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes i haven't even started on my sim
 Wontonimo: not even 1 line
 CGGCoder: Wait what?
 CGGCoder: You guys are making sims?
 MSmits: Astrobytes i think it's because you did not pick this game. When you're playing on CG you currently have 30-40 games to pick from, so you're spoiled like that. Now you're forced to play the one they picked
 Astrobytes: Well, that's not the reason I don't like it MSmits
 avdg: I don't have a sim, though I'm trying to add functions to make it possible 1 by 1
 jacek: column E is after fixing the bug. i think there are might still bugs <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/TX7wGBW.png">https://i.imgur.com/TX7wGBW.png</a>
 avdg: but honestly, it's still far off
 MSmits: true Astrobytes, but I remember when all these shiny boardgames werent on here, i enjoyed these contests more back then
 Wontonimo: CGGCoder yeah, if you want to do search you need a good sim.  Search is very powerful AI
 Astrobytes: This one reminds me of the last one, but less interesting.
 CGGCoder: ...
 CGGCoder: ok?
 MSmits: to me it's more interesting that the last one, but not more interesting than the boardgames&#160;:)
 avdg: mine can't calculate the next state yet
 Astrobytes: Just my opinion obviously&#160;;)
 LDami: Hey guys&#160;! how are you&#160;?&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: so i found UTTT really interesting because it was so small in scope that it was all about maxing stuff out.  This one is fairly close, so the maxing stuff is something i'm looking forward to
 CGGCoder: I'm fine.
 MSmits: yeah it's very much personal preference
 CGGCoder: How do you make a for loop restart when a new day comes?
 MSmits: i have no idea what that means CGGCoder
 Astrobytes: Hm?
 avdg: put a for loop in a for loop?
 jacek: huh
 LDami: I've just a little question for you&#160;! How do you would name a variable containing the number of barracks&#160;? "nbrOfBarracks" or "nbrBarracks", or something else&#160;?
 LDami: would you name *
 Astrobytes: Call it TheNumberOfBarracksIHave if you like
 jacek: numOfBarracks
 CGGCoder: nbrBarracks
 Astrobytes: It's your code
 CGGCoder: I prefer shorter
 Wontonimo: i like the variable name bob.  go with that.  or bobsNbrOfBracks
 JBM: resultOfApplyingABarrackFactoryCounterBean
 jacek: or dupa
 RoboStac: I'd probably call it n and then hate myself about 5 minutes later
 Astrobytes: RoboStac :rofl:
 Astrobytes: JBM: Classy!
 JBM: in a bad way ^^'
 LDami: Astrobytes: I know but it's interresting to know how other people do&#160;:)
 MSmits: why Bean JBM?
 JBM: i dunno
 JBM: it's a java thing i ever understood
 JBM: *never
 mororo250: Are there any way to save info into a file?
 MSmits: oh beans from the island of java?
 JBM: they have "beans"
 LDami: Thanks for answers&#160;:)
 MSmits: dont they produce beans over there
 JBM: maybe they plant them
 JBM: well, java beans at least
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: LDami: well, I'd probably do bCnt or something
 CGGCoder: ...
 MSmits: there you go, mystery solved
 Astrobytes: Coffee - Java - Beans
 JBM: thank you so much
 Astrobytes: :P
 Wontonimo: the randomness of this conversation reminds me of the NPC conversation in Simon the Sorcerer 
 CGGCoder: True
 MSmits: it seems random
 MSmits: but has a seed
 JBM: until you find its true meaning
 Astrobytes: It's multithreaded.
 jacek: Automaton2000 is it random?
 JBM: hmm lacks capitals
 Automaton2000: because i was doing a clash
 JBM: Its True Meaning
 Westicles: All these rules.  If you were assigned this for work you'd try to wriggle out of it
 CGGCoder: This is getting out of hand
 Smelk: Hello!
 JBM: sowing usually does
 Wontonimo: true Westicles , I'd talk with the BAs and push back
 HungryBurger: A new challengers has appeared.
 HungryBurger: Hello Smelk.
 CGGCoder: Hello, don't mind the others
 MSmits: BA's&#160;? Battleaxes?
 Smelk: Why can't I fight against my friend's IA, although we're both in Bronze league? I can't find him in the list.
 JBM: search better
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits. Battleaxes.
 CGGCoder: Rank?
 RoboStac: the list only shows the top 1000 as there were issues when leagues got too big
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 CGGCoder: I guess that makes sense
 Wontonimo: Business Analysts , but BattleAxes would be better
 JBM: does it help to follow him?
 Smelk: Oh, I thought using the Search field would search further than the top 1000
 Smelk: I'm following him
 Astrobytes: Battle Analysts &gt; both
 Wontonimo: Smelk you can use the search
 MSmits: business analyst seems like a job that would have a high suicide rate
 Wontonimo: hahhahahahahaa
 CGGCoder: I guess. yeh
 Astrobytes: lmao
 Wontonimo: :d
 MSmits: i cant imagine a more boring job
 CGGCoder: Oh, so that's why they are always recruiting every week.
 MSmits: well maybe i can, if i try, but i dont want to
 CGGCoder: Ah yes, some peace finally
 MSmits: ok i need to get on this sim verification thingy robo suggested
 Wontonimo: luckily in my current contract the BA I work with is actually great.  First time.  
 CGGCoder: Oh nevermind
 avdg: glad the best bots aren't too good yet
 CGGCoder: I'm currently trying to copy the bots with more or less a better strategy
 avdg: quite easy yet to take over land of a top ai for now
 Wontonimo: wait till legend opens
 CGGCoder: Oh hell no
 avdg: I will have less time this contest
 avdg: though there are some extra holidays end of next week
 CGGCoder: I'm currently imagining the IA's code being mostly calculations and looking into the future
 CGGCoder: Like probability, and stuff
 avdg: still 3 japanese in top 6
 Wontonimo: CGGCoder have you ever written code to do something like mini-max&#160;?
 CGGCoder: No idea what that is
 Wontonimo: oh, there are some really cool resources here on it
 avdg: never wrote a mini max tree
 avdg: got a bit closer to the math
 Wontonimo: hmm ... can anyone suggest a link to a CG resource on it?
 avdg: but I didn't pass the stage yet where I can say, I know it
 jacek: math, not even once
 avdg: you still compare :P

 Astrobytes: There are some nice visualisations out there if you search too
 CGGCoder: god i need to learn a lot more
 Astrobytes: interactive trees
 Astrobytes: *game trees
 Astrobytes: for plain minimax + alpha beta pruning
 jacek: game if about trees, why not use search tree algos
 CGGCoder: I want to go to computer science classes but I'm not even at the grade to pass there
 Astrobytes: Are you actually doing this contest jacek?
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: Impossibru
 jacek: slowly but i think maybe ill get to silver this time
 Astrobytes: Then I must do something at least.
 CGGCoder: Imma look at the links, need to inform myself
 Astrobytes: Also this video:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik</a>
 Astrobytes: And the Sebastian Lague one too if you like posh accents
 Wontonimo: ^ yeah, that's a really good one
 ddreams: score of suns / 3 rounds up?
 VizGhar: down
 Wontonimo: that's called trunc where i come from
 ddreams: right, yep
 VizGhar: Players gain an extra 1 point for every 3 sun points they have at the end of the game.
 ddreams: that's what I thought and programmed, but just misread the score in this game
 VizGhar: ^from statement^
 LightDarkness: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7e3fa01-7979-4b1b-b05c-3c0fdbf8a052">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7e3fa01-7979-4b1b-b05c-3c0fdbf8a052</a>
 jacek: LightDarkness does pow returns float?
 VizGhar: LightDarkness maybe you printed out decimals?
 jacek: then the printing would be decimal
 Astrobytes: ^
 VizGhar: 2**3 -&gt; 8.00 or something like that...
 jacek: 0.8e2?
 VizGhar: even better&#160;:)
 VizGhar: LightDarkness say "thank you" :D
 LightDarkness: lol
 LightDarkness: i was checking, but no, it should be decimal 
 LightDarkness: and pow returns decimal 
 jacek: so it will print decimal with likely scientific notation or .
 ddreams: missing return statement causes warning?
 ddreams: not sure what subtracts points there
 algeo: if we can beat boss in this play my code case can we get silver :p
 LightDarkness: ermm do you program in c++?if so, what should i use instead of pow?
 Astrobytes: Look the clash up here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 jacek: LightDarkness (long long)pow()?

 LightDarkness: why can't you write a code in this chat? :P
 jacek:  spoiler alert
 LightDarkness: aha
 VizGhar: LightDarkness too many newlines&#160;:) jacek is trolling sometimes
 LightDarkness: I think it's fine, so just to make sure.."score" in clash of code - reversed round is only about how many test cases are correct 
 VizGhar: oh jacek spoiler alert was about pyhton/ruby/js ... sry
 VizGhar: I should not ping you that much right?
 Astrobytes: pinging jacek is fine isn't it
 Astrobytes: jacek
 LightDarkness: lol, ok final newby question&#160;: D
 LightDarkness: @VizGhar 
 Astrobytes: Just type their name
 Astrobytes: No @ required
 VizGhar: Or start typing his name and press tab
 LightDarkness: Astrobytes like this?
 VizGhar: his/her
 ddreams: yes LightDarkness
 Astrobytes: Yes LightDarkness
 LightDarkness: ah ok 
 MounirEnmeiRyuu: Hey dudes,A trick to win the "Shortest" #clash_of_code, in Python, convert your code to utf-16, it will reduce the number of chars of the original code by half.Finally we can execute the utf-16 binary using:exec(bytes(code_in_u16 ,'U16')
 VizGhar: He has many names
 LightDarkness: thank you do much guys 
 LightDarkness: so*
 jacek: mhm
 VizGhar: cheater... kick him :D
 LightDarkness: ++
 JSboss: Hi guys, one question - using JS for Clash is sometimes a pain because variables are initialized using "const" rather than "let" or "var" and so are immutable, so in fastest mode the init tags need to be changed or removed in order to change the var. Any way the default could be changed to "let" or "var"&#160;?
 JSboss: Well, in all modes, but in fastest mode it wastes time needing to do that
 VizGhar: no JSboss... you have to deal with it
 Westicles: You mean like is there a button somewhere that will do that for you?
 Counterbalance: I don't think you even need to use var/let/const at all; they'll just be globa variables
 VizGhar: maybe you can ask in forum for some plugin, that will translate stub for you&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: control-H in the editor allows you to search/replace
 itzluku: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549381756">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549381756</a>
 JSboss: I am wondering why "Const" is the default (pre-printed) text used for inputs, i.e. why it's necessary to manually change it
 JSboss: and just wondered if there is some possibility that this default could be changed to reduce the time disadvantage
 UndercoverToad: sounds unlikely to me that they will change it (clash of code is not the only thing on this website) but feel free to request a change on the forum
 jacek: "clash of code is not the only thing on this website" w00t?
 JSboss: OK, I will do so, that tag has a specific use case and shouldnt be a default, whether CoC or other interface
 JSboss: Thanks
 jacek: well at least its 95%
 JSboss: ^^
 UndercoverToad: if they would care about 95% they would allow to select an IDE opponent below top1000
 Xenoid: At a past job where I used JS, variables were typically declared with const, because the philosophy was that mutating variables was a horrible thing that should never ever ever be done
 Xenoid: YMMV
 Counterbalance: constant variables?? :D
 Xenoid: Or just "constants," if you prefer. To me variable doesn't necessarily mean it has to vary, just that it's a placeholder that can hold a value that's specified at runtime
 JSboss: variable = 'can be varied'
 JSboss: It makes sense in that application, where mutating variables is categorically taboo, but that's not the case on this platform I would say
 UndercoverToad: constant variable, thus a constable?
 UndercoverToad: oh wait :cop:
 JSboss: :rotating_light:
 Westicles: you get rules like that when you are writing code together with a bunch of people you think are morons
 Xenoid: I agree it's not a great idea to have const be the default for CoC, because it makes it harder to code stuff quickly
 UndercoverToad: I still have nightmares from this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext">https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>
 Xenoid: Seems to me that if someone wants to use a functional language, then they should use a functional language, not try to turn C# into one
 SirLoxley: My bot is rank ~ 400 ... let's assume I slack for the rest of the competition, how likely is it to make gold?
 Counterbalance: 1%?
 UndercoverToad: exactly my feeling about that library
 UndercoverToad: i say 5% gold chance
 fvla: Imagine getting to legend with functional programming
 Xenoid: Challenge accepted? But not for this contest, we're too far in
 fvla: Even better, imagine getting to legend with functional programming *in C#*
 Counterbalance: you're likely to get to silver if you stay in top 800 or so, but gold is top 150 or so (based on the fall challenge)
 UndercoverToad: that few? :oI should write it down one day
 UndercoverToad: I remember legend is about 10-15 on opening
 jacek: AutomatonNN there?
 SirLoxley: arf.
 ShannonNorris97: I'm not sure if this is okay to ask or if anyone will want to answer since it's a competition, but are there any particular algorithms that you'd recommend to do well in the current contest?
 jacek: most likely beam search
 UndercoverToad: dbd r confirmed using a beam search
 ShannonNorris97: Ooh I've never heard of that - I'll look into it. Cheers guys
 jacek: i havent use it yet, mine is flat monte carlo with eval
 Counterbalance: now i can finally put those 20 threads to good use
 Marchete: I don't know, beam search seems to ignore enemies too much
 AntiSquid: the words beam search were spammed in chat all day, maybe it works
 Westicles: BULB
 Marchete: but if top players say it, then it's true
 JBM: if it's true, it doesn't mean it's the major part of their strat
 Marchete: or beam search*
 Marchete: *terms apply
 jacek: or they say its beam search so we waste time on that while they use something else
 jacek: thats some meta isnt it
 Marchete: that's a new low :D
 itzluku: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
 itzluku: won against #1

 DomiKo: close one
 DomiKo: gz
 algeo: well done
 Recovery_disaster: love the fact, that Oioi is using Python3&#160;:)Even if I dont even know how to be in first place with it
 itzluku: pushed my new version to the arena
 itzluku: lets see :O
 jthemphill: what makes beam search better than MCTS with a low exploration factor?
 itzluku: whats the win/lose ratio for top10 bots&#160;?
 k4ng0u: itzluku it depends against who :pYou can see the stats on their last matches here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/Oioi">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/Oioi</a>
 itzluku: dude 200-100 players are way harder than top100
 struct: unlikely
 Queuebee: would it be viable to give minimax a timelimit instead of a depth? or would the calls to time be inefficient?
 ahkoh: how to get into silver league?
 itzluku: wait 2 days
 Marchete: minimax with timelimit it's usually iterative deepening
 jthemphill: @Queuebee it is efficient to call a timer, but you'll want to make sure your minimax is not depth-first
 Marchete: do some depth, then if you have free time try a higher depth
 jthemphill: ^
 Astrobytes: ^
 itzluku: ^
 jthemphill: ^^
 Queuebee: Okay well good to know. for whenever I ever manage to implement it ^^
 Astrobytes: And search the best move from depth-1 first to save more time and increase depth
 algeo:  /|\
 Queuebee: do you mean, keep continuing that branch in the next turns? instead of restarting each turn? 
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: iterative deepening
 Marchete: imo don't reinvent the wheel
 jthemphill: @Queuebee so you start by completing a minimax with ply 2
 Marchete: check google
 jthemphill: then you check timer and see if you need to return the best move
 Astrobytes: No, restart, but try that best move first, that you found on the previous depth
 itzluku: imagine having the same score every 3d game and losing to 1 or 2 extra trees
 jthemphill: then you deepen to minimax with ply 4, but you only look at the best moves that the ply-2 search returned
 jacek: how often draws occur? in my local testing they never occurred :thinking:
 Queuebee: golly
 Queuebee: Okay thanks everyone I'll have to read up onn uhh everything. I really thought I was on the right track with minimax&#160;:')
 jthemphill: glhf!
 Astrobytes: Hey, it's a fun thing to explore
 Numby: So eh... is opponent score not provided in the input? That would be so tedious having to implement keeping track of changes on each turn to calculate opp score&#160;;/
 Numby: Actually nvm, I'm blind
 ddreams: pretty sure it's impossible to calculate it too
 jacek: yes it is
 jacek: you get it
 Astrobytes: oppScore
 Astrobytes: iirc
 Astrobytes: ymmv depending on lang
 Numby: I think it should be possible to calculate it too since you can check if a tree disappeared between each move but it would be a hassle for sure. Glad it's in the input (just didn't see it earlier)
 ddreams: hmm.. yeah, actually it is possible
 ddreams: I was thinking you could seed, grow and complete after the opponent waited, but the tree becomes dormant
 ddreams: you can complete and seed again, but that's trackable
 GangstaKGK: sa
 MerryMentat: How many people typically get into Legend, out of curiousity?
 Smelty: idk
 struct: I think last contest was around 20 when it opened
 Smelty: wow
 icecream17: i just thought of an optimization: if a player has no trees, and the other player has more points, the other player automatically wins
 jacek: :tada:
 Wontonimo: 5000 players
 CGGCoder: oof
 tibithegreat: am I blind or in the normal game graphic there is no place to tell which day it is?
 tibithegreat: the debug mode looks kinda ugly and the game information is also a bit annoying to track
 Wontonimo: debug mode is the only place i see it
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547822232">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/547822232</a> lol this wood 2 game
 tibithegreat: Wontonimo&#160;:(
 itzluku: what is the edge default for cell neighbor indices that are outside the 0-36 index grid? i thought its -1 but the defualt is 1 for me...
 icecream17: you can always output the day in the message
 Wontonimo: ^^ great idea
 tibithegreat: it's only visible for one turn tho
 tibithegreat: when you wait
 itzluku: anyone?
 Counterbalance: it's -1
 itzluku:&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: itzluku what kind of data type are you using?  unsigned int?
 itzluku: python
 itzluku: no type
 itzluku: XD
 Counterbalance: there's no default, it's explicitly given in input
 Wontonimo: it's -1 for me in python
 Counterbalance: example init data:

 itzluku: # neigh_0: the index of the neighbouring cell for each direction
 itzluku: 404 Not Found
 Wontonimo: do what Count_balance did itzluku and print out the values you read in
 Counterbalance: there's neigh_0 .. neigh_5, one for each neighbour
 Wontonimo: using the print( "debug stuff" , file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 itzluku: ah wait
 miszu: good morning children
 itzluku: the index is -1
 Wontonimo: good morning teacher miszu
 jacek: happy caturday
 Astrobytes: Catty hapurday jacek
 miszu: alright, time to code the solution to get out of wood 1
 jacek: hint: print second available move if moves.size &gt; 1
 miszu: are you serious? That's all it takes?
 iDash: +1
 ClockSort: lol
 miszu: I was about to use some badass strats to find the optimal tree to grow
 Astrobytes:  I sorted lexicographically but yes, it's literally a piece of p*** to get out of wood
 iDash: It will bring you around:Bronze LeagueRank 2,151 4,339
 jacek: welp i wouldnt take it seriously before final rules
 itzluku: u will need the badass solution later anyway
 itzluku: :P
 iDash: working on it&#160;:)
 miszu: my dumbass solution of wood 2 brought my to rank 123/465 in wood 1
 Astrobytes: Just account for the added action and you're good to go
 CGGCoder: what was your solution?
 miszu: for wood 2?
 CGGCoder: Yeah
 fvla: please help me template metaprogram a spiral index to 2d graph D:
 fvla: D&#160;:
 miszu: chop chop the most rich richness tree
 CGGCoder: oh
 CGGCoder: same
 CGGCoder: lol
 fvla: wood 1 you just have to grow and then chop, or some variation
 Astrobytes: Why bother with that. They gave us moves.
 miszu: I wouldn't dare to chop chop the least rich richness tree. As a businessman I have standards
 CGGCoder: For wood 2, I just done all of the commands possible in reverse so the WAIT is at the end.
 CGGCoder: I'm currently at wood 1
 Astrobytes: fvla: what?
 iDash: lol
 miszu: funny that first command it imputs is the WAIT command
 miszu: so basically, take 2nd command
 CGGCoder: Yeah no sense
 CGGCoder: I do it reverse
 CGGCoder: Most of them are random i guess
 fvla: i can't believe you guys cheesing wood leagues using command list, lol
 iDash: random geves worse result than secons ot even than last
 fvla: i have standards
 CGGCoder: Lazy goes a long way tho
 Astrobytes: Why not? Wood is pointless. Need Bronze rules/
 CGGCoder: yeah
 fvla: ig
 iDash: preffer grow over seed 
 miszu: let's do the 2nd move and see if I can best the mighty Ghiboss
 fvla: it's still funny how this cheese actually just works
 CGGCoder: I'm putting my own code
 CGGCoder: So it's more efficient
 Saltron: yeet
 miszu: CGGCoder with blackjack tables and hookers?
 Astrobytes: Quit yeeting
 CGGCoder: miszu - What?
 miszu: you don't know the meme?
 Astrobytes: Blackjack and hookers!
 miszu: yeah
 CGGCoder: Nope haven't been informed
 miszu: ohhh
 Astrobytes: Futurama... Bender...
 miszu: I must educate you
 miszu: lemme find it

 miszu: with the pick 2nd move strats
 miszu: FB AI should hire me

 miszu: so 3/4 I won vs Ghiboss
 CGGCoder: r/softwaregore
 CGGCoder: What's your technque again?
 CGGCoder: Too lazy to scroll up
 miszu: won 9/10 with the might strats
 miszu: ok so basically
 miszu: the list of all possibles moves, pick the 2nd one
 miszu: if there is only 1 move then it's the WAIT move
 CGGCoder: ok so just the one after the WAIT
 miszu: correct
 miszu: make sure you do bound check
 CGGCoder: uhm
 miszu: everyone knows you cannot forget that&#160;:)
 CGGCoder: ok
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549521966">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549521966</a>

 Astrobytes: ^
 miszu: wayy to fancy man
 MSmits: well my sim check found an error. Was a good idea to fully match opponent actions and sim states
 miszu: if numPossiblesMoves &lt;= 1, print wait
 CGGCoder: ok wth is this
 miszu: yay I will be promoted!
 CGGCoder: miszu yeah seems ok
 Astrobytes: miszu that got me straight into Bronze
 miszu: yeah I will go bronze now
 miszu: joining the MLG now
 Astrobytes: Other than that, I don't care much for this game
 miszu: why not?
 miszu: you don't like it?
 Astrobytes: I find it quite boring.
 jacek: MSmits what was it
 Astrobytes: And just like a variation on the last one.
 miszu: what I don't like is to code the engine and unit test it for bugs
 NinjaDoggy: just code the engine without the unit test then&#160;:)
 MSmits: i was giving richness bonuses as 1,2,3 , based on the richness. As opposed to 0, 2, 4
 miszu: well you are asking for hours of debugging a silly mistake
 Astrobytes: Anyway, don't let my opinion stop you, I'll do something at some point
 Astrobytes: Nice bug MSmits
 NinjaDoggy: nah this game is way more interactive than the last one
 MSmits: yeah, i doubt it will change that much though
 Astrobytes: NinjaDoggy: *Slightly
 NinjaDoggy: it won't be a billion beam searches (that don't take into account of opponent) in legend i don't think
 Astrobytes: Beam and Chokudai is the meta rn
 jacek: keep in mind if both actions are COMPLETE players receive original nutrients
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: another thing to think about is what happens when two players seed same hex
 Astrobytes: I just don't like it
 Astrobytes: You get your s**T back MSmits
 MSmits: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Well, both do
 MSmits: and still go dormant right?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: which is good, that way you dont get infinite seeding
 MSmits: i still remember the push locks in xmas rush
 jacek: hmm technically you could
 jacek: ah waiit, no
 Astrobytes: Hah, yeah MSmits
 Astrobytes: no jacek, I don't think a seeding-lock is possible
 DaNinja: checking the referee, you dont get a refund
 jacek: huh
 DaNinja: ah my bad, you do
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: BadNinja
 AntiSquid: can't find the bug, maybe i should just drop it and do something meaningful
 DaNinja: damn Java
 MSmits: mmh i will need to check sim for sun points as well
 MSmits: thats a separate check as both players last actions have to be waits
 NinjaDoggy: just wait for a turn where your opponent is dormant
 NinjaDoggy: and your action is wait&#160;:)
 miszu: there is no AI for going to silver league?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: miszu there will be
 MSmits: when silver opens
 miszu: ok not available yet
 MSmits: a player at rank x is chosen (prolly 500 or so, maybe 800)
 MSmits: that player becomes boss
 AntiSquid: i have this ... red normal bot vs blue wait botdepth 20, can go even up to 100 @_@ that thing keeps taking a nap
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549528395">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549528395</a>
 miszu: imagine the top 500 are all legendary worthy code.... most people will be stuck in bronze
 MSmits: do you mean it only considers wait as action and searches to depth 20?
 AntiSquid: it considers everything
 MSmits: my first beamsearch version would only do wait
 MSmits: in my case both the max element and nth element had their sign wrong, picking the worst action
 Nerchio: My beamsearch did same&#160;:(
 struct: wait can cause problems with eval&#160;:)
 Nerchio: its so disappointing after writing it for 10h or so
 struct: specially if you multiply with day
 MSmits: I also had a bug where I did * instead of &amp; on a bitop
 MSmits: bunch of bugs and every bug caused my bot to prefer wait
 MSmits: it's like it was thinking, nope, sht happens when i dont wait
 struct: MSmits on beam search am i supposed to also include parent states when selecting the best?
 MSmits: why would you do that/
 struct: I dont
 MSmits: yeah but i mean, why would you consider that even?
 MSmits: what makes you think it might be good
 MSmits: it's a different depth level
 fvla: i just programmed a constexpr function to transform indices to xy coordinates in 2d space lol
 struct: true
 MSmits: it's like finishing a minimax iteration and then picking the result from the previous iteration that searched less deepo
 MSmits: fvla we all need hobbies
 fvla: i'm learning metaprogramming so that i don't need ugly switch statements
 fvla: to optimize my doce
 NinjaDoggy: fvls why do you need x,y?
 fvla: *code
 MSmits: i dont think i ever had a switch statement in a bot :P
 MSmits: if else if else if else if else :P
 fvla: because i don't want to calculate distance through an inefficient graph
 fvla: oh no
 NinjaDoggy: why not precompute distances?
 fvla: i am
 fvla: through *metaprogramming*
 MSmits: i don't use any distances at all
 NinjaDoggy: I assume you precompute masks for each distance then
 NinjaDoggy: (same as me)
 MSmits: i just have a map of reachable seedhexes for every size
 fvla: no bitboard just yet
 MSmits: and every source hex
 fvla:&#160;:(
 struct: same
 NinjaDoggy: bitboards is so much easier than non bit boards honestly
 MSmits: if you are used to it, yes
 MSmits: if not, it's just gonna give you a headache
 struct: im not used to it and found it easier
 MSmits: and cause many hard to find bugs
 MSmits: if you've done it twice before that counts as being used to it :P
 fvla: i'm transforming into bitboards after i get basic coordinates working
 struct: I only did it for uttt
 NinjaDoggy: co-ordinates is such an ineffecient way to do it&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: both in terms of run time and coding time
 MSmits: mmh uttt counts as being used to it too :P
 MSmits: considering the time most people spend on a uttt bot
 struct: MSmits also do you recomend to have player tree masks or trees[2][4]?
 NinjaDoggy: LOL honestly yeh, UTTT is more than enough
 MSmits: it's fine, i do it differently though
 fvla: but coordinates are a nice abstraction when you learn to program it
 MSmits: i have a single trees[4]
 MSmits: and a owner
 fvla: and they will translate nicely to bitboards
 MSmits: (uint64_t)
 MSmits: so 5x uint64_t instead of 8x
 NinjaDoggy: genius...
 NinjaDoggy: wait no
 AntiSquid: same
 icecream17: YES! generateLegalMoves... generated the legal moves!!!! finally!!!!
 fvla: UTTT?
 NinjaDoggy: you need an extra and operation each time though?
 AntiSquid: do you bitboard shadows&#160;? :P MSmits
 MSmits: yeah you do NinjaDoggy, it's a tradeoff
 MSmits: but shadows are easier
 MSmits: less maps to shade from
 MSmits: i do AntiSquid
 MSmits: uint64_t shadeArray[3][6][37] = { 0 }&#160;;
 Michael_Howard: On submit why do I usually seem to lose the 1st 2 battles then win most of the next 30? Are the first 2 picked from higher up?
 AntiSquid: cool me too
 miszu: it's true that bitmapping the board is more difficult because of the hexagone shape
 MSmits: not necessarily
 AntiSquid: total element size of that is 666 MSmits
 MSmits: if you do everything with lookups, it does not matter
 MSmits: AntiSquid yeah
 struct: you do shadows with lookup?
 MSmits: yeah
 miszu: makes sense
 struct: and its faster?
 miszu: yes
 MSmits: i just use the first 37 bit of uint64_t
 NinjaDoggy: you're still looping through every tree though right?
 miszu: you just bitwise or all of them
 MSmits: struct i have no clue
 MSmits: it's all very very fast, performance is not limiting me
 struct: I can shadow everything with &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; shifts
 struct: yeah you are right
 MSmits: i am looping trees yes NinjaDoggy
 struct: I didnt care about performance
 Nerchio: tbh eval is the hard part
 Nerchio: not bitset itself
 miszu: what's a good resource for eval
 AntiSquid: well . i have something else for shadows, was considering MSmits version first 3 * 6 * 37 but then picked something else, you do other kind of loops elsewhere so not sure which is best
 miszu: honeslty the eval that makes sense is how many points you have
 miszu: in that state
 miszu: if you are able to go deep
 MSmits: it's dangerous to use score points miszu
 NinjaDoggy: no...
 MSmits: you win this game by completing trees later
 NinjaDoggy: in order to go super deep you have to prune
 MSmits: early on you have to *have* trees
 MSmits: if you eval score, then you're just going to delete your trees
 Nerchio: if you don't simulate opponent your search is only useful until certain depth imo
 MSmits: unless of course you get all the way to the end of the game in your search
 MSmits: that last eval can be actual game score
 struct: time to go depth 130
 NinjaDoggy: are most people not simming opponent with beam search?
 struct: im not
 MSmits: i think most players just use heuristics
 struct: but my bot is still the one from beta test
 MSmits: but the most used search is probably bs
 MSmits: ignoring opp yeah
 MSmits: but top players could be doing anything really
 NinjaDoggy: nah, then there should be a bigger gap
 miszu: pick random moves
 miszu: best start
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/549550334">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/549550334</a> oh look it made trees lmao ... -.-
 Nerchio: similar problems AntiSquid its losing to my bot that has like 2 ifs
 struct: Do eval slowly
 struct: Like
 struct: Make it plant seed first only
 struct: then move to next step
 struct: and so on
 MSmits: AntiSquid seems like your progression is the same as mine, took me an hour or two to get it working after i finished coding first version
 Waffle3z: any way to search clash of code problems to fix ones with problems?
 DaNinja: tried this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 MSmits: lol Waffle3z
 Donald_D._Doge: someone mentioned clash during contest? ban / report / kick / execute automaton2000
 Automaton2000: u need to get lucky
 MSmits: it's contest time, lets spend it going through clashes and fixing them :P
 itzluku: haha i am fixing bugs since 40g
 itzluku: 40h*
 Zenoscave: does overall score not work as a eval Struct?
 Nerchio: no
 Astrobytes: Now I KNOW that's a Westicles one Donald_D._Doge :rofl:
 MSmits: Zenoscave only on the last turn
 Zenoscave: hmmm...
 MSmits: before that you need to eval having trees mostly
 MSmits: and sun points to some degree
 MSmits: i guess you can have score too, but make it small
 struct: Also dont eval sun points very high
 struct: or you will only wait
 Westicles: Astrobytes, stop gaslighting me :P
 Zenoscave: I'm going to start with pruning the search space before branching
 Zenoscave: Westicles then stop making alts
 MSmits: pruning helps a lot
 Astrobytes: Never Westicles :D
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Donald_D._Doge: Astrobytes i'll shave your cat if you don't
 Zenoscave: Also Hi all.
 struct: hi
 MSmits: gaslighting is when a buddy has a lighter and you ate some bad food right&#160;?
 Zenoscave: I wish MSmits
 Astrobytes: I keep my pussies hairy, the fight is on
 Astrobytes: And hiya Zeno
 Donald_D._Doge: "manipulate (someone) by psychological means into doubting their own sanity." MSmits
 MSmits: and then lighting their farts?
 Zenoscave: Yes.
 Zenoscave: then lighting their farts
 Astrobytes:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: No, gaslighting is a serious issue. Here, in the context of Westicles, it is anything but 
 Astrobytes: WEsti + Doge
 Zenoscave: gaslighting is definitely a serious issue. I just am not immune to a fart joke
 Astrobytes: I admit to the same.
 MSmits: :grin:
 JSboss: I'm glad the term and the concept have entered the mainstream in the last couple years, no one talked much about gaslighting before 2017
 MSmits: wait for it to be abused too much and lose all meaning
 JSboss: and it happens often enough with serious enough ramifications that it behooves people to know abt it
 JSboss: well it's already something of a buzzword i guess
 JSboss: but still
 Astrobytes: No, it's been a recognised issue over the years, I think the terminology only recently hit the mainstream
 Astrobytes: Ah yes, sorry, just re-read your statement
 Astrobytes: MSmits: when it matters it cannot lose meaning
 MSmits: what i mean is, they will use it in situations where it's not really gaslighting
 MSmits: therefore weakening the term
 Sarkraf: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: Yes, and what I mean is that when it matters it cannot lose meaning.
 Westicles: yeah, there was an SNL sketch recently making fun of just that MSmits
 Astrobytes: Otherwise it's plainly redundant or false with even any sensible scrutiny
 Astrobytes: -even

 MSmits: spoiled teen girl voice
 Westicles: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah I mean I get that
 Astrobytes: I cannot get on with these people with 0 life experience shouting about social justice and applying it to Every Single Thing.
 mororo250: Is multithreading available?
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: But that doesn't mean everyone should completely disown the ideas where they are applicable - unfortunately that is the side effect.
 Astrobytes: Sure mororo250: Get several needles, couple of spools of cotton thread, good to go
 Astrobytes: But no.
 Westicles: Yeah, I keep telling my gfs... you are 18, you can't accuse me of grooming
 AntiSquid: gfs&#160;? as in multiple ones&#160;?
 Westicles: er, well imaginary ones of course
 Astrobytes: Westicles: Your game is strong
 Astrobytes: If a little sillyl
 Astrobytes: *silly
 AntiSquid: woah&#160;! it flinched&#160;! it's not rank 4k+++ anymore
 Westicles: which it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, i lost 1000 ranks in 36 hours
 Astrobytes: Judging by the position I'd say it's down there with Pennywise
 itzluku: i think i totally just made my bot worse
 itzluku: xD
 Astrobytes: That's par for the course, don't worry about it.
 itzluku: but 1000 ranks?
 itzluku: :D
 Astrobytes: It's a contest.
 Astrobytes: Unless you find a strong strategy that beats the current strong ones you're just gonna wobble up and down the leaderboard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was gone, attending a college graduation

 MSmits: yay i watched 20 replays and not a single sim error&#160;:)
 MSmits: i output "SIM ERROR" as a message when my checks fail
 MSmits: so warn me if you see it&#160;:)
 MSmits: crap i found one
 skotz: fixing a negative nutrients bug helped more than i expected
 MSmits: ohh it's a 2 seed to the same hex situation
 MSmits: thought i handled that
 MSmits: oh right, negative nutrients, thats important as well
 AntiSquid: this wreck is finally climbing
 AntiSquid: i have no clue what i fixed or how btw
 AntiSquid: just changed eval values and submit spam, tiny improvement Q_Q
 MSmits: nice when that happens
 Emperatrice: moi je suis a ~800 avec 3 "if" pour mon algo mais je ne connais pas les truc CSB, XR, MCTS ou DUCT.
 Emperatrice: du coup je plafonne je ne vois pas quoi ameliorer
 MSmits: btw, i recommend you check sim this way: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549625306">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549625306</a>
 MSmits: literally takes me 3 seconds to check an entire game for sim errors
 MSmits: message is so nice
 struct: MSmits I check vs playing vs myself
 AntiSquid: #fr Emperatrice
 MSmits: ah, locally you mean
 struct: For simultaneous actions
 struct: no
 struct: also on ide
 struct: but yeah also works localy
 MSmits: how is that better than messages?
 struct: how can you test simultaneous actions?
 struct: like seeding
 struct: the same cell
 AntiSquid: it's the scoring and selection not the sim
 struct: ah ok
 struct: I tested whole sim
 AntiSquid: talking to smits
 MSmits: struct what i do is, i sim my own action with all opponent actions
 MSmits: i get like 15 new states
 struct: ah makes sense
 MSmits: then i check all of them on the next turn for equality
 MSmits: if i find none, then i output SIM ERROR
 MSmits: and i can scroll throug the frames in seconds and spot it
 struct: I understand
 MSmits: just found one again
 MSmits: i keep bugging on the same seed thingy
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/549625539">https://www.codingame.com/replay/549625539</a>
 MSmits: around frame 47
 MSmits: it doesnt actually matter for my beamsearch, but its annoying
 struct: it happens when both  seed same cell?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: maybe i coded it a bit sloppily
 MSmits: what i did was, i just let both players seed there and remove the seed afterwards and refund
 struct: Yeah, I also should fix my code
 struct: currently I have 2 functions to apply actions
 MSmits: only 2?
 struct: 1 for actions of same type and another for different
 struct: Well its if else inside it
 NinjaDoggy: isn't refunding harder?
 MSmits: you mean when both players do an action of the same type?
 struct: yes
 NinjaDoggy: because you have to properly count the number of seeds before the move?
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy i didnt bother much with that, it's just a debug check
 struct: I store action cost and gain 
 MSmits: yeah there's probably an easier way
 struct: inside the action
 NinjaDoggy: if you check they're seeding the same position, just put the 2 trees on cooldown and that's it
 MSmits: i dont actually ever sim a double seed action, as my opponent is static
 NinjaDoggy: true
 MSmits: makes sense NinjaDoggy, i'll go change that
 struct: yeah its what I do
 struct: I think I have cost or something stored due to undoAction
 MSmits: ohh i found the bug
 MSmits: if (myAction == Seed &amp;&amp; oppAction == Seed &amp;&amp; myIndex == oppIndex)
 MSmits: but the index is a combined index for source and target for the seed
 MSmits: and my opponent has a different source
 MSmits: so this check  is never true
 struct: you store source and target in same&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, so i can use the same state
 MSmits: state stores an action type and index
 MSmits: but seed is the only one with 2
 MSmits: so i just combine them
 MSmits: could have also done index2 and make it -1 for the others
 MSmits: i probably would not now have this bug :P
 struct: so N bits of myIndex store source and some store target?
 MSmits: sourceIndex + 37 * targetIndex
 struct: ah right
 MSmits: so myIndex&#160;% 37 = sourceIndex
 MSmits: myIndex  / 37 = targetIndex
 MSmits: allright, fixed, i hope, let's try another 30 games in submit :P It's pretty rare

 rafaelSorel: yep when you submit over 20 test in a row 
 rafaelSorel: or so 
 rafaelSorel: you get stuck for 5 minutes
 Nerchio: so do you guys sometimes get random timeouts too or its just me
 Nerchio: garbage collector should not take any time i dont really use objects
 fvla: I use C++ so I can't relate
 fvla: no but seriously, which language?
 Nerchio: java
 fvla: hm
 fvla: there should be no such issue with an if/else bot
 fvla: which algorithm?
 Nerchio: not sure i always get these timeouts at the start of events and later they happen less but i dont know if its because i fix my bots or servers work better
 fvla: I have no clue then, sorry
 Nerchio: i got a beamsearch on bitsets with an object pool (so should not get garbage collected ever)
 fvla: hm
 DaNinja: no timeouts with c++ and a 98ms limit. YOu start your timer after reading the first inputs?
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: well sometimes it drops me even before the search starts so kinda weird
 DaNinja: segfault maybe?
 Xenoid: What is a good way to time C++? std::chrono::high_resolution_clock?
 DaNinja: yes
 fvla: yeah, std::chrono is great
 Xenoid: ok cool, thanks
 Nerchio: well i allocate 700k State objects on the first turn 
 fvla: uhhhhhh
 fvla: as in using "new" 700k times?
 Nerchio: yeah
 fvla: i don't know enough about Java to help you much, but I can tell you that using "new" that many times in any language is a recipe for disaster
 GibbonThatCodes: my question here would be .. but why?
 GibbonThatCodes: Like newing up 700k things seems excessive o.O
 fvla: if you do that in C++, every C++ programmer in this chat would slap you in the face one after anotehr
 Nerchio: well you can't not use new in java so..
 GibbonThatCodes: Right but like, why do you need 700k things?
 fvla: yeah
 zach1502: lmao
 fvla: and what are the things?
 Nerchio: i had 300k state searches in the middle of the game and well more on the first turn i guess i will just try to lower it 2x
 fvla: the hell
 GibbonThatCodes: like, in total in my c sharp side of things right now I create like .. 40 - 45 things.. and thats it.. 
 zach1502: insane
 Nerchio: but I didn't think it should be a problem with allocation
 rafaelSorel: depends what you put/process on your state 
 Nerchio: last event i had 300k states allocated first turn and it worked
 Nerchio: and that had 50ms limit
 jsmurl: dumb question: can you do more than one action a turn? this line confusing me "As long as you have enough sun points, you can take any number of actions."
 yuyu: 700k news&#160;!= 1 new for 700k object, no idea how to it in Java but you should do the latter
 Xenoid: You can do one action per turn, and multiple actions per day
 jsmurl: how many turns are in a day?
 rafaelSorel: if you just process the sun points + score you can process several states I guess 
 Xenoid: As many as needed until both players use the WAIT action
 jsmurl: ohhh I see
 jsmurl: thanks @Xenoid makes sense
 Xenoid: No problem
 rafaelSorel: but if you start adding things like shadow prediction and grow prediction, things will get slow I think 
 rafaelSorel: but yes 700k Nerchio seems pretty good 
 Nerchio: its not good if it randomly times out haha 
 rafaelSorel: beamsearch or MCTS&#160;?
 Nerchio: beamsearch
 rafaelSorel: ok
 Nerchio: but as you said, these numbers were at the start when not much evaluation went in
 rafaelSorel: yep 
 Nerchio: but on good turns i still get 300k
 Nerchio: and well if you go with C++ you can probably double it
 rafaelSorel: yes if you don't free anything :D
 Nerchio: anyway
 Nerchio: eval in this game is kinda pain :D
 rafaelSorel: yep for the timeout , you can stop your beamsearch if you start hitting 80ms or so 
 Nerchio: I do ofc but problem with garbage collector is it can spike for 30ms or so
 rafaelSorel: ohh
 Nerchio: maybe it did garbage collecting on states over 400k that were considered unused even if kept in array
 rafaelSorel: no way to disable it in java&#160;? like in python when can do gc disable
 Nerchio: no you cant really control it
 Nerchio: or some kind of memory rearrangement that took 30 ms
 Nerchio: so if added to my beamsearch was going over the limit
 Marchete: garbage collection of 400k states?
 icecream17: hmm, I placed a seed, then I had 2 sun, and 3 seeds. But the game says I can still place seeds
 Nerchio: I preallocated 700k states, but only first 400k were used after round1 
 Nerchio: so maybe it did some funny stuff with the last 300k
 Marchete: but if you keep an array[] or list with these they won't go GC
 Nerchio: thats what i mean
 Nerchio: they are in an array
 Nerchio: so nothing should happen
 hyphz: 700k Nerchio? Starcraft?
 Marchete: yeah
 Nerchio: but i lowered it from 700k to 400k and i dont get timeouts 
 Nerchio: for now?
 Kellthazar: Rust has no GC :D
 Nerchio: weird
 Marchete: if I recall I had these
 Marchete: some static factory constructor
 Marchete: so I called getNew()
 Marchete: that took free objects from a list
 Marchete: and release
 Marchete: for the same
 Marchete: 0 GC
 Marchete: but a PITA
 DaNinja: you checked the forum? Theres a couple of posts about GC
 DaNinja: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/timeout-in-tic-tac-toe-in-java/164930/6">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/timeout-in-tic-tac-toe-in-java/164930/6</a>
 Nerchio: thats what i am doing cause its kinda neccessary for GC languages that use searches
 Marchete: C# has functions to try to minimize GC
 Nerchio: if you try playing with too many objects in GC languages you are not going to have fun on Codingame :D
 Nerchio: and I already got some experience from previous contests and it still surprises me
 DaNinja: 700k width beamsearch? :D
 icecream17: nevermind, it was my bug
 Nerchio: i use width 700 now but didn't play around with it too much
 icecream17: alright! generateLegalMoves is done (x2) so maybe search time?
 icecream17: oh wait, i also have to implement "do action"
 dreadylein: guts would tell me to check the move generation and search itself if something builds up gc pressure
 dreadylein: the array shouldnt be the problem in theory
 Nerchio: except preallocated State objects my search is all primitive types
 Nerchio: so should be clean
 dreadylein: hard to tell, guess your best bet is profiling the exact point

 Rag: :grin:
 miszu: DaNinja that's my post!
 miszu: I am famous
 DaNinja: did you ever get it fixed?&#160;:)
 icecream17: ok, i switched from js to typescript and fixed 1 bug. submitting
 miszu: I fixed it by kicking java out of the window and coding it in c++
 miszu: I was able to reach legendary in UTTT
 NinjaDoggy: yep that's my experience too&#160;:)
 miszu: reaching legendary gave me ptsd
 DaNinja: a wise decision
 miszu: the grind was real
 miszu: I wonder if the strats here is simply spend 1/3 of days planting as many seeds then next third upgrade as many trees and last third chop everything
 NinjaDoggy: no, upgrading trees give u more sun
 NinjaDoggy: and planting costs more the more seeds u have
 zenwraight: Hi guys I have a question, how can I print debug statements other than COmplete and wait commands
 miszu: cerr &lt;&lt; "ain't gonna give you up &lt;&lt; endl;
 DaNinja: print to stderr
 NinjaDoggy: you can't print messages for seed or grow?
 miszu: yeah
 miszu: anything after the command is extra stuff
 hexa8: never gunna giv u up!never gunna let u down..
 miszu: so like: SEED 50 ain't gonna give you up
 zenwraight: got it let me try
 miszu: you will see your wizerd singing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do not rick A us
 miszu: you're a wizerd Harry
 zenwraight: thanks guys printing to err works
 miszu: we accept donation via paypal or bitcoins for the help
 zenwraight: it's my first time in this type of contest,I am a beginner 
 miszu: we provided
 zenwraight: looking forward to learn from u guys 
 DaNinja: good luck learning anything from us!
 zenwraight: do u guys take part in other challenges like on codeforces etc&#160;?
 miszu: as long as you don't ask for answers we will help
 miszu: during ongoing challenges, don't expect too much help as everyone has the secret sauce
 zenwraight: yes sure not during contest
 DaNinja: the post mortems in the Forums are a good source of tips from previous challenges 
 zenwraight: Got it thanks a lot&#160;:) I will check it out  once i get past the first league
 miszu: especially the previous challenge
 zenwraight: aah thanks for the hint
 miszu: lots of strats are relevant here
 zenwraight: since how long have u guys been taking part&#160;?
 miszu: I started yesterday
 miszu: the challenge
 zenwraight: nice
 zenwraight: no i meant these kind of challenges
 miszu: I am in bronze but I am discouraged of coding the engine for simulations
 miszu: I did 2 competitions
 miszu: and some outside of the competition time for education
 zenwraight: got it
 slamo: how do you print debug text in go?
 DaNinja: it should say in the default code comments
 DaNinja: fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Debug messages...")
 PatrickMcGinnisII: msmits, i decided to start using a lookup table for the shadows, u think adding an extra hex would save cpu cycles?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like sun position 0...index 1...tree size 3 ... change mask on board indexes 7,19,38 ... or just use neighbor stuff?
 Smelty: o.O
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe a need some tree spirit juju
 PatrickMcGinnisII: earlier he said he was using 37 as the board size, I'm thinking an extra cell could be used to dump off board masks eliminating a condition statement
 DaNinja: like shade[3][6][38]&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, not so deep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if bits 0 and 1 are the treesize
 DaNinja: I thought he said he pre-calculates shade[3][6][37]
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 DaNinja: 666 uint64
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was thinking shadebyindexdirection[37][6][3], lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but if it trails off the board, then a cell index of 37 would just be a dumping ground for xor operations
 DaNinja: why would it trail off? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so a board state size of 38 instead of 37
 DaNinja: for the -1 neighbors?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tree size 3, on index 7...would shade 7,19, and then an offboard cell 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: elliminating the test for -1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not having to use the neighbor thing at all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm just thinking aloud
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so 7,19,37
 PatrickMcGinnisII: imma try it
 DaNinja: dont think its needed if you just do shade[idx][dir][size] &amp; (1&lt;&lt;cell)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i wanna mask right on the board
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i see what u are saying
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the board has to be cloned/copied anyway...and i would be adding a bit op to the copy to reset the shadow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damned if i do and damned if i dont
 Zenoscave: Struct what's your beam width
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kinda personal there Zenoscave
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry
 Zenoscave: Hes told his depth. Just figured I might ask&#160;;)
 Westicles: 200
 Zenoscave: IS that troll westi?
 Westicles: hey zeno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what's the max commands in a day any1 has encountered?  I think i did 2 grows and a seed, but haven't seen more, anyone?
 Zenoscave: hiya 
 Zenoscave: Theoretical max is 38
 Notter: You can do more than one command a day?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I compute all the commands for an entire day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there can be multiple turns/day, but only 1 output per input cycle i believe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I haven't been able to compute optimal sun ramping spanning multiple days yet
 DaNinja: yep, as long as you have enough sun points
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can drop 2 seeds in a day, but dropping 3 in a day is dumb
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darn ok, i see a grow grow grow seed seed on round 14
 CouscousAgha: Can you train vs a specific person&#160;?
 DaNinja: yes, delete the AI and select
 DaNinja: but limited to the top 1000 in your league
 Westicles: Zenoscave, this is from earlier on beamwidth
 Westicles: struct: more than 1k less than 10k 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in midgame i see a max of like 66 legal moves, it's just a matter of finding the best combo
 Zenoscave: Ah yeah I fogot there's an index from and to on seeding
 Rag: to find best combo u also simulate enemy moves?
 Zenoscave: A rough estimate would be 18^2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think the next step is just not grow on cell that will shadow anyway on next turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darn, i grow and shadow my own trees as well which has a - overall effect
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 AbsentMoon: I'm struggling to come up with an efficient way to calculate the possible locations for a tree to plant a seed. Does anyone have any suggestions?
 icecream17: tree.neihbors.neihbors.nehibors, remove duplicates, remove self, remove non empty cells
 Westicles: You are given a list of all possible moves
 Bernard_Lowe: I agree with icecream. Be sure to keep unusable tiles though.
 icecream17: O(n^3) solution. some peopl hardcoded it - so O(1)
 icecream17: but i was too lazy to hardcode it
 AbsentMoon: I am about halfway through hard coding it... but I'm lazy.
 icecream17: if anyone has already hardcoded it plz plz share
 PatrickMcGinnisII: finally

 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm gonna submit and sleep
 DaNinja: gg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i see u icecream17
 xuanwei-go: how can i  join in the game that i have failed in clash of code just now?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 302nd from 801st ... not bad for piddlefarting around.
 Smelty: dang
 miszu: oh imposter of the vent, tell us your secret sauce
 Smelty: *imposter kills you*
 miszu:&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the basics without more than a depth 1 day sim... is to count your trees by size... stay within certain proportions and it';s close to optimal... no quite, but close
 PatrickMcGinnisII: g'nite, have fun
 Smelty: my code doesnt run&#160;:((
 xuanwei-go: get go
 miszu: btw guys, tomorrow is mother's day in case you forgot
 icecream17: oh yeah time to look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Search">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Search</a>

 CommanderCero: could someone with c++ experience help me? I'm trying to generate a random number with the uniform_int_distribution and it works in my own IDE but not on codingame

 pmor: looks ok to me...but you may want to seed it with a number so that you get deterministic runs
 pmor: So that when you replay to track down a bug, you get the same run
 pmor: using std::random_device will give you non-deterministic runs
 Csipcsirip: isn't the default seed constant&#160;? 
 CommanderCero: yeah thats a good idea, will do that after Ive solved the problem. Also when copying the code from the stackoverflow post it works for some reason, but I cant find the difference
 CommanderCero: i see the const was the problem, yeah makes sense since calling it would cause an change in the random generator
 pmor: yeah, const there is a problem
 CommanderCero: thanks guys!

 yfprojects: How do you find the longest possible path for your submarine?
 Csipcsirip: ty, I use simple wall hugging atm
 pmor: i use dfs
 eulerscheZahl: i use BFS forr 
 eulerscheZahl: for the next step only
 eulerscheZahl: i have a more sophisticated method for tronbut that would make tracking too easy, do i don't think it's smart to find the best possible fill
 pmor: Best to use it for the starting position, and then switch to making moves that limits narrowing down your location
 struct: damn kovi didnt join long ago and he is already near the top
 struct: Also nobody using D
 dbdr: what a surprise
 Zenoscave: who would have guessed&#160;;)
 struct: But it was so requested&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but they only wanted to see D on the platform without caring about the platform itselft
 dbdr: AntiSquid said he actually likes D
 dbdr: IIRC
 eulerscheZahl: i thought he just submitted some D bots for the trolling factor
 dbdr: I though so too
 Zenoscave: could be either 
 dbdr: but asked him
 Zenoscave: both are viable
 Earthborne: Can we get Julia on the platform? :D
 dbdr: you can vote for it
 eulerscheZahl: Earthborne suggest it here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-what-programming-language-would-you-like-codingame-to-support-next/99904">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-what-programming-language-would-you-like-codingame-to-support-next/99904</a>

 Zenoscave: Bah you must've improved
 eulerscheZahl: yes struct
 dbdr: yeah, they should not have a multi puzzle of the week during a contest&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: noticed it this morning
 dbdr: I know Zenoscave, I mean which rank?
 eulerscheZahl: you rank dbdr
 Zenoscave: I was @ 10 last good submit
 dbdr: yes but my rank is changing&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: I see 
 eulerscheZahl: i was at 30added a spawn on the largest lake, 50 now
 Zenoscave: probably won't out rank 15 rn
 Earthborne: Didn't know Powershell counted as a programming language
 eulerscheZahl: it's turing complete
 dbdr: gg eulerscheZahl :D
 dbdr: try the smallest lake
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Zenoscave: lol 
 dbdr: less crowded
 pmor: isn't powershell just a front for .net?
 dbdr: safe from most torpedos and mines
 Zenoscave: not completely
 eulerscheZahl: so, why do we need c#, vb.net and f#?
 eulerscheZahl: all the same
 Zenoscave: Let's get rid of c# then?
 dbdr: let's have only turing machines
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 dbdr: everything else is redundant
 eulerscheZahl: calling for a new weird puzzle dbdr?
 Zenoscave: oooh that would be fun
 dbdr: would be nice yes!
 AntiSquid: SQL is turing complete, add SQL to CG :D

 Zenoscave: nice climb dbdr
 dbdr: thanks. i'm trying the 10 spot free for you&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: thanks&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: is what TC dbdr&#160;?
 dbdr: fight with Schnee instead
 dbdr: Turing Complete
 dbdr: Mandelbrot
 Zenoscave: no SQL is
 AntiSquid: was saying sql is turing complete
 dbdr: then you said mandelbrot also worth mentioning
 Earthborne: Minecraft redstone is turing complete
 dbdr: why wasn't clear
 AntiSquid: mandelbrot thingy in sql just looks interesting and weird
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: ah
 dbdr: should open the link I guess
 AntiSquid: yes since i mentioned sql already

 Earthborne: But that poll, is the team just plowing down the result list? I see Typescript and D were already added
 dbdr: it counts, but not automatic I think
 eulerscheZahl: typescript was added because a paying client wanted it
 AntiSquid: TS was maybe easier to add since there's JS already

 dbdr: Zen&lt;tab&gt; gives someone else
 Zenoscave: Z&lt;tab&gt; Ze&lt;tab&gt; and Zeno&lt;tab&gt; all give me
 Zenoscave: strange
 dbdr: it depends who's on the list
 struct: refresh dbdr and fixed
 dbdr: and the webchat is strange
 AntiSquid: sometimes when i have multiple CG tabs open and refresh i still get usernames in tab that aren't in the chat anymore
 struct: nick tab works for mods online and all the users that have typed in your current chat window
 dbdr: best for everyone to minimize the unique prefix of their pseudo
 dbdr: hm, there's a puzzle in that...
 AntiSquid: Antho-CS

 Zenoscave: almost pinged recur_se
 AntiSquid: remio
 dbdr: AntiSquid could you kick AntiSquid, he's spamming the chat and pinging random people?
 AntiSquid: sorry&#160;:(
 dbdr: joking
 dbdr: autokick
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid can you kick dbdr he suggested the idea
 AntiSquid: nah i shouldn't spam
 Zenoscave: true
 Zenoscave: sorry as well
 struct: Ban :hammer:
 dbdr: maybe it's attract new people to the chat&#160;:)
 dbdr: it'll
 Zenoscave: Are the usuals not good enough :P
 dbdr: hm, I wonder, if you pseudo is "the" you must be pinged constantly
 AntiSquid: but sometimes the chat has many consecutive messages of pure gibberish, although they might look like a real conversation
 Zenoscave: "sometimes"
 dbdr: Auto&lt;tab&gt; =&gt; nothing :o
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: thats what you mean now
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you can make a good bot
 Zenoscave: ftfy
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN why are we still spamming :D
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem with it?
 Zenoscave: lol
 dbdr: Automaton2000 fixed indeed
 Automaton2000: hey guys can you help me with the temperatures puzzle
 Zenoscave: no
 AntiSquid: ok then keep spamming i guess AutomatonNN
 dbdr: ok, so it's people who have written in what I see. good to know
 Zenoscave: that's one you should solve on your own Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i don't even know what that means
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the puzzle about the video array of all characters as the valid 
 Zenoscave: lol always pinged
 AntiSquid: quite mean they keep it this way
 AntiSquid: whoever is in charge of the bot
 dbdr: it's not hardcoded I think
 struct: I mentioned solution
 struct: everytime Automaton pings euler, euler makes a bot that pings magu s
 dbdr: or he changes his pseudo
 dbdr: the automatons won't keep up
 Zenoscave: I should have a bot that changes my psuedo to euler whenver he changes his from it
 AntiSquid: but maybe he feels attached to his pseudo&#160;?
 Zenoscave: perhaps
 AntiSquid: funny royale had to change his due to a multi
 Zenoscave: I think i commented out all my sonar
 Zenoscave: That may be an issue :thinking:
 AntiSquid: easy to make some multi with a theme that justifies having mag us in the title, if only euler would have thought about it :P
 AntiSquid: is a nested switch case a bad idea? 
 Zenoscave: typically
 kovi: hmm, big variance
 kovi: 22-&gt;11 tonight
 AntiSquid: and for a moment i thought you're applying some high level statistics to narrow down the enemy's position .
 Schneewittchen: Sequential Monte Carlo
 Till: In wood league you can win surprisingly many battles by just making valid moves...
 wlesavo: Illedan, eulerscheZahl, did you guys thought of nerfing the mines by giving up the direction it is planted? right now it seems kind of useless to even keep track of them. or is that too harsh?
 mchl12: I remember a game in which my AI eliminated 20 possible positions by triggering a mine. I am not sure what the average information gain of a mine trigger is however.
 mchl12: I don't feel like it useless to track it, I also don't know how the nerf would effect it.
 struct: well it could reduce  states quite a bit
 wlesavo: well state wise it does give up some information, i meant using the prediction of mine placing in your moving strategy
 Illedan: I have considered it. But it is very hard to know what effect such changes would have. As I like the game now and don't want to break it.
 struct: Imagine you had aroudn 100 states, and enemy placed a mine
 wlesavo: Illedan thx, got it
 struct: currently at worse case would be after placement 400 states
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cb8ce54-972c-4d3d-a6f5-72b44ed0cfb7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cb8ce54-972c-4d3d-a6f5-72b44ed0cfb7</a>
 struct: with your idea, it would be the same 100
 struct: Mine position would make mines useless imo
 Illedan: Not really
 kovi: maybe nerf cooldown
 Illedan: as you can block of area
 wlesavo: not positions, just directions
 wlesavo: but yeah, seems to be a big change
 wlesavo: nwm than
 struct: I think the 1 damage wouldnt change much
 Illedan: Harder to use it for tracking
 struct: ah there is that
 struct: Might be good then
 Illedan: And random 2 damage is kinda much :P
 wlesavo: yeah, that could be worth it
 Illedan: But that would break every prediction&#160;:(
 struct: Changes at this time is always an hard choice
 wlesavo: well not every
 wlesavo: but yeah
 wlesavo: same with removing mines after explosion, seems really balanced, but would break many bots
 darkhorse64: It reminds me of UTG where you could chain explosions. May be I haven't thought enough to it but I hardly see how you can track mines in the current design. This explains probably why I am so low
 struct: Have you tried saving all the possible states?
 darkhorse64: In this respect, giving mine positions would have a large impact because it would help pruning potential positions even more than firing torpedoes
 struct: but yes it can be a bit hard
 wlesavo: well it still helps now
 struct: because you will never know if it was N/S/E/W
 darkhorse64: I currently save all possible positions bit not paths.  So a MINE is potentially 4x positions
 darkhorse64: It's useless. So I guess I have to save history so that everytime a position is pruned, it removes a path and potential mines. Add SILENCE and I think your bot bombs
 struct: it can help you a lot
 struct: even more when a mine triggers
 struct: If he triggers a mine you could remove all states than never crossed that position and placed a mine in that dir
 struct: or just that never placed a mine on that dir, might be simpler
 darkhorse64: Got it. I am a bit concerned about memory and timeouts but I guess I am pessimistic if you have already gone this way
 struct: I havent, but I think some players have similar approach
 wlesavo: you cant really store all the different paths
 wlesavo: due to chain silence 
 darkhorse64: I remember a thread where people timeout at frame 90 because of the # of paths
 struct: well that was with quite a few paths
 struct: and with a bot that was made just to test this
 wlesavo:  this is gonna happen for sure in quite a few games
 struct: But I guess you can ask some players how many paths they can store
 struct: The timeouts happen if your bot only moved
 struct: and used no skills
 struct: if you use Sonar, torpedo, mines
 struct: it helps a lot
 wlesavo: i think most people store the points where candidate definetely have been
 darkhorse64: If you do not store everything for pruning later, you are helpless against mines
 wlesavo: this is why i asked about giving up the direction it was placed
 Illedan: I'll think about it
 dbdr: is there an actual problem to solve?
 wlesavo: dbdr how do you store path? :slight_smile:
 dbdr: I meant, why are we considering changing the rules?
 wlesavo: not really, i just asked if this is even a possibility, not really considering
 Sam_Thundro: hey i started this game today.so,can anybody tell me how to make friends in this game
 darkhorse64: dbdr&#160;: If you scroll up, the discussion arose from the fact that mines prediction perplexed me. Not excluding the fact that I miss something, I do not see how you can deal with mines without storing all possibles paths and pruning at the risk of timeouts
 Sam_Thundro: hey I am asking something
 darkhorse64: It's a competition. There are no friends here :grinning:
 Sam_Thundro: oh I see , what a let down
 darkhorse64: just kidding ...
 Sam_Thundro: you tricked me buuu...
 Uljahn: just follow Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: there is no need to be in the top 20
 Sam_Thundro: so how can we anyway?
 Skril: darkhorse64&#160;: you can merge info from different paths to avoid timeout&#160;;-)
 Uljahn: hover over an avatar
 wlesavo: Skril doing the same, but this way you effectively erasing the path between the silences for this candidate, and cant for sure restore history, which is the main consern 
 Skril: That's if you reconstruct mine positions from the path. There are other means ^^
 wlesavo: well maybe i miss smth, im sure people here will get through it
 Sam_Thundro: hey how can we make friends?
 wlesavo: Illedan, was the silver opening shifted? i think the date have changed
 darkhorse64: If there is a solution, great. I would be concerned that the game turns into random where victory depends on walking on unpredictable mines
 Illedan: Same date wlesavo
 wlesavo: hm, wasnt it march 27? my bad then
 Illedan: Still is?
 wlesavo: League opening: 3/28/20
 wlesavo: maybe some local problems on my pc
 dbdr: depends on your time zone maybe?
 Illedan: ^
 dbdr: should be friday evening in central europe
 wlesavo: previously it showed me the correct date, i didnt change the time zone for sure
 wlesavo: nwm, just was surprised
 darkhorse64: skril: was that mentionned in the chat&#160;? I have an erratic connection
 Skril: I don't know
 darkhorse64: k

 wlesavo: Uljahn oh, thx, this works
 DavidJangdal: How do i run this against my friend?I can only add AI bot
 Uljahn: have you submitted your code at least once?
 wlesavo: DavidJangdal you can delete AI and choose the opponent, if your friend submitted his code
 DavidJangdal: Oh, ok. forgot to submit, thanks!
 Scarfield: when you submit, you get in a league, and you can do what wlesav-o said to people in your league or lower leagues&#160;:)
 DavidJangdal: thur
 DavidJangdal: We have now submitted our code. But we can't find each other in the list. We can find a bunch of other people
 Scarfield: the submits need to finish before yoo can see each other i guess

 AntiSquid: is that yuyu hakusho avatar&#160;?
 yfprojects: Would you replace tracking yourself by calculating the information given away if you knew how?
 Schneewittchen: wut?
 ZarthaxX: :I
 yfprojects: Some people here use there tracking tools for tracking theirself
 yfprojects: To plan their next steps
 eulerscheZahl: on my TODO for so long
 yfprojects: Who is already doing this?
 eulerscheZahl: then it wouldn't be on my TODO anymore
 yfprojects: I am not asking you eulerscheZahl
 Schneewittchen: here
 eulerscheZahl: but i refactored my code to extract the tracker to a new class
 eulerscheZahl: oh, sorry
 yfprojects: So if you knew a way to calculate this using simple maths, would you use it instead? Schneewittchen
 pb4: tracker is such a big mess in my code -_-
 yfprojects: So you have a number representing how much the opponent knows but you dont know where yyour potential positions are
 Schneewittchen: @yfprojects For sure, but I would say its minimum as complicated as tracking your opp
 yfprojects: I am not sure because i am getting onto sth. there
 Schneewittchen: It depends on your strategy. If you want to hide or sth you have to know the "known" positions
 yfprojects: Do you?
 yfprojects: The possible positions move accoring to your submarine
 Schneewittchen: I use it for silence
 yfprojects: If n&lt;10 -&gt; SilenceThis would work too
 Schneewittchen: But not in which direction and for how many steps
 Schneewittchen: but yeah it depends
 yfprojects: The direction is irrelevant because the opponent wont see it
 yfprojects: I would then calculate the best next position and move there

 AntiSquid: and maybe i should add something more than just basic enemy detection :p
 muy31: yeah my bad
 muy31: AntiSquid, how do you so effectively evade my sensing?
 AntiSquid: i don't even try to
 AntiSquid: you murder me don't you?
 AntiSquid: silence is bs, maybe that's how
 muy31: ok but yours is ridiculous
 AntiSquid: look the bot what it does, it doesn't do anything exceptional lol
 muy31: usuually by the 60th turn, I've pinpointed the opponent to like two or three places
 muy31: but you use silence in a way that continuously keeps it above 50 places
 eulerscheZahl: and then silence ruins it
 AntiSquid: the silence isn't fun at all to deal with imo
 muy31: I will copy my debug stream from turn 148 of a 239 game...
 muy31: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d4e6ce14-f8a3-4437-b896-f74fb9947fbd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d4e6ce14-f8a3-4437-b896-f74fb9947fbd</a>
 muy31: This is the game... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442625569">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442625569</a>
 muy31: oh yeah my coordinates are row, col
 muy31: not x, y
 icecream17: can you silence and move at the same time?
 muy31: yeah
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: all commands at once
 muy31: even surface
 muy31: but not trigger and mine
 icecream17: Hmmm.... can you go through an island while silence?
 muy31: no... im pretty sure
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: only real life sub walk silently on land
 muy31: ok someone help me...
 muy31: under what circumstance do I want to use SILENCE
 muy31:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: whenever it's annoying to the opponent
 muy31: what would "trigger it" perhaps?
 AntiSquid: kind of always
 icecream17: i'm 19th with my wood2 code on wood1, so i'd say it's not that useful unless it's the 40th turn or so
 icecream17: or unless you spam it
 AntiSquid: icecream17 are you stuck in wood1?
 icecream17: no i made it to wood1 yesterday
 AntiSquid: ok just add silence to your bot and you instantly promote to bronze
 icecream17: need to update possibleOpp array though
 icecream17: the "ohno" check (silence) timesout
 muy31: you can actually promote w/o anything else except for torpedo
 Astrobytes: you can promote with just silence
 muy31: and a good sense technique
 AntiSquid: ya but if you want just the promotion, silence is the easy way out
 muy31: ig
 icecream17: ig?
 muy31: i guess
 icecream17: oh
 AntiSquid: nthsmaar?
 icecream17: well, silence would be extremely hard to put with my code....
 AntiSquid: = nice to have so many annoying acronyms, in case anyone wonders
 Astrobytes: if silence is not charged move +  charge it else silence? What's hard about that?
 AntiSquid: just do silence instead of torpedoes icecream :D
 muy31: he means using silence
 AntiSquid: or interchange move and silence 
 AntiSquid: silence N instead move N
 icecream17: no i mean detecting if my torpedo hits but i move far away so now my opponent has to be within 4 of where im at and stuff
 AntiSquid: even silence 0 will do 
 icecream17: hmm
 icecream17: wow amazing
 AntiSquid: silence N 0, no change in movement calculation
 Astrobytes: I got to bronze w/ no enemy tracking, just move + silence 
 AntiSquid: ya total bs
 icecream17: huh... what does MSG message do?
 Astrobytes: think about that for a minute
 AntiSquid: it furiously can taunt your enemy
 muy31: it lets u say MUDA MUDA MUDA
 AntiSquid: without them seeing it
 icecream17: i'll just charge it up in the first moves then do it randomly.
 icecream17: also that makes me wonder what your ...boats? are like
 icecream17: what's the best way to account for opponent silence? [have possibleOpp array]
 AntiSquid: idk if it matters, just use silence and hope for the best :D
 TheRedChild_406c: ssssoooooo nicce
 muy31: i also have possible opp array
 icecream17: I have an array called "totalsOpp" showing how much the opponent moved up, down, left, or right.
 icecream17: But now with silence....
 mchl12: What do you use the totalsOpp array for?
 muy31: ok i can help you
 muy31: icecream17
 icecream17: possibleOpp[0] + totalsOpp[0] = Current Opponent position (row or x)
 muy31: does your code find the starting point of the opponent/
 icecream17: yes
 muy31: ok
 icecream17: the torpedoes don't line up that's why it's bad
 muy31: so whenever your opponent uses silence, reset totalsopp
 muy31: and reset possible opp
 icecream17: =O
 AntiSquid: nah you have to expand actually, although it's dull it's the only way
 muy31: to all possible positions
 muy31: that could have been done by silence
 icecream17: Oh... so the original opponent position can change and differ from the start....
 muy31: yes!
 icecream17: yes
 muy31: and it can be the new possible positions due to silence
 icecream17: so i spam silence charge at the start. when should i silence?
 icecream17: also many islands look suspiciously similar
 muy31: im still working on when to use silence
 icecream17: i'll just use it as soon as possible and see
 mchl12: Many islands look similar because they have a minimum size of 2x2 (unless they are along the top or right edge)
 muy31: mchl12 the dodge at the end, fantastic AI
 muy31: kind of legendary
 muy31: mchl12 are you keeping track of how much I know about your position, or are you ignoring it
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442640850">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442640850</a>
 mchl12: Thanks&#160;:) I do keep track of how much you know about me. It should be the second number in my MSG
 AntiSquid: wow i drop in ranks a lot :D
 muy31: RIP your number is less than my number...
 muy31: im talking about mchl's MSG number
 struct: mchl12 is the first message the possible enemy positions
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: it is
 mchl12: Yes it is
 struct: if yes, then why do you sonar when enemy only has 1 possible possition?
 muy31: i was about to ask the question
 mchl12: muy31, are you deducing positions based of mine triggers
 muy31: no
 mchl12: then that is probably it
 muy31: i haven't done anything with sonar or mine
 muy31: in terms of response to enemy
 muy31: placement
 mchl12: struct, my ai is not perfect by any means
 muy31: what can i deduce from mine placement?
 muy31: not really a range...
 Astrobytes: *triggers
 muy31: prompt me
 muy31: i can't think of a way
 mchl12: for each possible path that the opponent took, i keep track of the possible positions of the mines. When the opponent triggers a mine I can eliminate some possible positions.
 muy31: hmm
 blasterpoard: mchl12 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442642724">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442642724</a> I tested my traching against you and we have the same output xD
 blasterpoard: at least for a couple of turns
 muy31: but how do you know when that mine was placed? do you keep track of everything mchl12?
 Astrobytes: You get MINE in the opponent actions
 muy31: i think i have a foggy idea then
 muy31: thx
 mchl12: not everything, if I kept track of the exact path the opponent took I would be able to deduce slightly more in very specific cases. But I decided that that would not be worth the time investment yet
 AntiSquid: astro are you not competing?
 mchl12: But you do need to keep track of all possible positions and the possible mine locations that belong to those.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but slowly. I have a lot to deal with rn
 AntiSquid: judging by your rank you seem even less interested than i am
 muy31: ok then
 Astrobytes: No I'm interested, waiting for some dedicated coding time. Too much on the go rn
 icecream17: i'm playing against myself
 icecream17: what? my updated code has -1 life sigh
 muy31: maybe your array has a size of 0
 muy31: due to nuances in your code
 icecream17: No, I moved down, up
 icecream17: I somehow added the previous space back to my available spaces....
 muy31: oh
 muy31: when you determine something from the present situation, do you make changes to your current position array?
 icecream17: my current position is the x and y from the input
 icecream17: (no)
 muy31: i meant opponent current position
 icecream17: yes all the time
 muy31: how do you make sure that those changes are permanent?
 muy31: that they carry on to the next turn?
 icecream17: "var" -&gt; global variable
 icecream17: they changes and stay changed
 icecream17: javascript
 muy31: i know
 icecream17: oh so wait.... nevermind i forgot
 muy31: does your start position array change permanently?
 muy31: too
 icecream17: I don't have a start position array
 muy31: so how do you set new start positions?
 icecream17: oh, you mean the opponent? i just add it to the array)
 struct: nice wlesavo
 icecream17: vqbaghaqrefgnaqjunggungzrnaf...
 muy31: you need to remove everything from the start array, and the new positions possible from the opponent doing silence to the start array, and then reset the totalopps array
 muy31: *empty the totalopps array
 Astrobytes: struct, when delete?
 icecream17: but how would the opponent array affect mine? [because i move down, up]
 struct: I havent coded a line yet
 struct: So I cant tell
 wlesavo: struct thx!
 Astrobytes: lol, fair enough 
 struct: I have ideas though
 muy31: by start array i always meant opponent's possible start positions (my bad for being unclear icecream17)
 struct: I still have 24 days
 struct: plenty of time
 muy31: b/c start + moves = current
 Astrobytes: Just waiting on the last day submit then a table flip, then delete?
 muy31: so you need to make changes to the start affect the current
 muy31: and changes to the current should affect the start
 struct: I dont think  i will wait for last day this time
 icecream17: my current = x and y [input]. oppCurrent = possibleOpp + totalsOpp
 Astrobytes: lol wise move struct&#160;:)
 struct: Maybe Ill have something soon
 icecream17: oh i'm probably being stupid sorry
 muy31: yes, so if we change oppCurrent, it should change possible Opp
 muy31: and if we change possibleOpp it should affect oppCurrent
 icecream17: oh i get it now.
 muy31: and if we empty totalsOpp oppCurrent = possibleOpps
 icecream17: oh ok... but the problem i was talking about was 'my' ship going 1 down, then 1 up. "Invalid MOVE: Obstacle or already visited cell".
 icecream17: sorry
 muy31: for real?!
 muy31: my bad then
 icecream17: dont know what happenned with communications
 muy31: i have a 2d array called canIGo
 muy31: that I change to false for every coordinate that I visited
 muy31: after printing my move, i set the coordinate to false, so that my move function does not take a move that will go on to that sqaure into account
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442649983">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442649983</a> i delete the possible space but somehow it didn't work
 muy31: my bad i wasn't paying attention
 muy31: have you tried console.error-ing possible things?
 muy31: just to debug it yourself icecream17
 muy31: also, i recommend you keep playing against the wood 1 boss instead of yourself
 muy31: Do you think that I should go out of my way to avoid mines completely?
 muy31: can one silence through one's visited cells?
 Astrobytes: One cannot
 Astrobytes: "Silence requires 6 charge actions to load. This allows you to move 0 to 4 cells in a given direction (not visiting already visited cells or islands). Your opponent will not know in which direction or how far you've moved."
 muy31: thx
 struct: USA has more cases than china now 
 struct: than china had*
 pmor: confirmed....and I'm not sure how reliable china's numbers are.
 struct: We both think the same dont worry
 pmor: but the people here aren't taking self-quarentine as seriously as china did.
 struct: HealthCare in America its a bit harsh isnt it?
 pmor: Its incredibly expensive if you don't have insurance
 Swagboy: Chinese governement knows how to be persuasive
 struct: mchl12 I found timeout on a replay
 struct: do you want it?
 Zenoscave: good guy struct helping player in rank 1
 struct: i think he knows he timeouts
 struct: The enemy had 25k possible states
 Beerus: i defetead the wood 2 without shooting torpedo
 muy31: cause it hurts itself pretty stupidly
 Beerus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442653354">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442653354</a>
 muy31: honestly beerus dont expect that is ever going to happen with anybody else's AI
 Astrobytes: Beerus you can get to Bronze without shooting a torpedo
 muy31: yes you can, but not b/c opponent is hurting itself
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 icecream17: somehow when the opponent silences  it changes stuff....
 muy31: is there a way to determine the location of the mines?
 struct: well you know it can be in 1 out of 4 spots
 struct: that is if you know is exact position
 struct: his*
 muy31: yes
 muy31: true
 icecream17: I fixed a bug that made 0 opponent positions, but even though nothing's wrong there's now too many positions and ii'm losing....
 icecream17: Oh. Nevermind, another bug solved it.
 Astrobytes: Bugfix is bug to fix bug. The foundation of all great software :D
 icecream17: submitting
 icecream17: Oof 8 losses of the first 10
 icecream17: oh wait... resubmitting
 icecream17: 4 losses... better
 egaetan: lot better
 Ayo35: Sup
 Ayo35: Sup
 icecream17: hi
 Ayo35: hi
 icecream17: 40% of the time: I win with 6 lives. 60% of the time: Boss wins with 1 life. This is so annoying.
 struct: Seems like once boss detects you, you cant escape
 icecream17: I should silence later than move 7...
 icecream17: Math.random() &gt; 0.95 should do good
 Swagboy: haha sounds about right
 icecream17: It's a tie! Wow. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442685218">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442685218</a>
 icecream17: I added one line of code and I won with 6 lives (brainache)
 icecream17: My awesome if statement (used twice to solve bug): if (x &lt; n OR (x &lt; o AND rl AND (rl.i(q) isNot p)) OR ([a[rl.i(q)], a[rl.i(r)].s().j() isNot t &amp;&amp; [a[rl.i(q)], a[rl.i(r)].s().j() isNot u) then b[b.i(M.m(n(o)))] = p
 Astrobytes: glwt
 struct: your code makes it looks like you are codegolfing
 icecream17: No, it has enters and tabs but i cant do that.
 icecream17: And i(), s(), j(), M.m(), and o() are built in functions.
 icecream17: Oops, forgot to puts the &amp;&amp; into And
 icecream17: Oof I also forgot ']' twice
 Astrobytes: Not being funny but ther *has* to be a better way to write that mess
 Astrobytes: *there
 struct: also they are probably not built in functions
 icecream17: shortened to 1 letter
 Astrobytes: But why the f would you do that?
 struct: I see
 struct: you have 100k chars available
 Astrobytes: This is not code golf
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/dnsEa3h">https://imgur.com/a/dnsEa3h</a>
 icecream17: it looks better than it looks
 Astrobytes: um...
 struct: so your code doesnt actually looks like what you pasted here
 icecream17: Yeah, it has enters and tabs. I told you... why do i comment at all
 Astrobytes: Why not just paste the code snippet? Why change it?
 struct: You can comment is fine, it just looked weird if you coded like that
 icecream17: thanks but i still feel bad
 struct: what for?
 struct: The screenshot is readable
 struct: the code before isnt
 icecream17: hmmm.... code golfing what is that
 icecream17: and idk
 Astrobytes: "shortest mode"
 AwesomeMan: lololololololololollololololololololololololol
 struct: yeah code golf is code solution in the least ammount of chars
 icecream17: i'd think a really complicated language would win those contests
 icecream17: oh well i'm going back
 Astrobytes: To...?
 icecream17: figure out another bug
 icecream17: which is not a bug but a result of fixing bugs
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fixing_problems.png">https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fixing_problems.png</a>
 icecream17: awesome
 KiwiTae: icecream17 thor never goes north hehe
 icecream17: ...?
 Astrobytes: kek
 Astrobytes: Kiwi you doing the contest?
 KiwiTae: I pressed JoinIn button last night &gt;,&lt; still reading the title
 KiwiTae: I am bit busy&#160;:( my game going out soon on consoles hehe
 struct: your game?
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah, as good a reason as any&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: im AI engineer for a gaming indie studio :D got certified on steam xbox and nintendo switch &lt;3
 struct: Which game is it?
 Astrobytes: "Peel the Kiwi" 
 Astrobytes: :P
 KiwiTae: Georifters its called trailer is out soon ill share hehe
 KiwiTae: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QWhEuQxps">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QWhEuQxps</a>
 Astrobytes: Hm, portals and stuff
 Astrobytes: Looks like a pretty fast gameplay platformer,  the graphics are a bit annoying (just imo) but looks like fun
 KiwiTae: &gt;,&lt; its childish graphics haha
 KiwiTae: we won best casual at anaheim dreamhack before the pandemic hehe
 Astrobytes: Oh nice! How many players?
 KiwiTae: 1 to 4 players
 KiwiTae: got a coop mode for campaign too
 Astrobytes: cool, looks like it'd be fun with &gt; 2 players for sure
 Astrobytes: Oh cool, coop would be cool for 2 player
 KiwiTae: it is .. thats why its not out yet.. fucking playing it all afternoons at the office &gt;,&lt; slowed down the production hehe
 KiwiTae: jk~
 Astrobytes: hahaha :D
 KiwiTae: and we have fancy cosplay for the characters 
 Sneffy: Hey! someone available for a question in c++&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol of course.
 KiwiTae: Sneffy sure
 Sneffy: I am playing csb right know and i have 3 class
 Astrobytes: Right I gotta go, later Kiwi
 KiwiTae: see you pewpew
 Sneffy: Point, checkpoint and pod
 KiwiTae: hehe CSB
 Sneffy: chekcpoint and pod both have point
 KiwiTae: yes
 Sneffy: i have a function in point class that return distance between 2 point
 Sneffy: if i use pod-&gt;dist(checkpoint) it works
 Sneffy: but i have a function score() in my pod class
 Sneffy: and when i do this-&gt;dist(checkpoint)
 Sneffy: it says it cannot convert checkpoint to point
 Sneffy: i wonder why i can use the function in my main and not in my pod class function
 KiwiTae: maybe cast (point)checkpoint
 Sneffy: it works
 Sneffy: but why do i need to cast in this case
 Sneffy: and not when i use it outside of pod class
 KiwiTae: do you have your Checkpoint class after pod class in your file?not sure that would affect
 Sneffy: yes
 Sneffy: i'll try to make it before 
 Sneffy: and test again
 Sneffy: 2 sec
 Sneffy: Okey that was it
 Sneffy: Thanks you&#160;!
 KiwiTae: np :D

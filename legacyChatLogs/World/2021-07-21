 ShadowTaz: How do yoy play the clash battle?
 Jakhongir2003: hi
 derjack: good morning
 struct: hi
 Benedikt.Huber: Morning everyone
 tImProCodEr: hi
 TK-421: Greetings
 BlaiseEbuth: Happy caturday.
 T-UMM: hello
 Marchete: MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571294311">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571294311</a>
 Marchete: I sometimes can win
 Marchete: but I have many timeoutes
 struct: nice
 MSmits: Marchete how do you win exactly?.
 MSmits: is it when scores are nearly equal?
 Marchete: I got more points
 MSmits: yeah i see, you actually didnt beat his nim calculator
 MSmits: this is an example of mikla not knowing how the endgame works
 MSmits: he says "win" 
 MSmits: because he got control over the endgame
 MSmits: but he sacrificed too many boxes
 MSmits: and plays out the endgame poorly
 derjack: he says win to discourage opponent
 MSmits: that would be funny 
 derjack: if only the referee could give the name of the opponent
 MSmits:  Marchete check how he says win at frame 36
 MSmits: that's when he won the nim game. But he doesnt realize there's 2 4-loops there and other relatively small objects. So he loses on score
 MSmits: this is why your idea of setting up the board unfavorably for the person in control is a winning strategy vs him
 MSmits: he gave away all the 4 loops to you when he should have just taken them and given you control
 MSmits: Marchete did you do this on purpose? Getting the board like this?
 Marchete: nope :D
 MSmits: oh ok well you should
 Marchete: I'm in early tests
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571295887">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/571295887</a>
 Marchete:&#160;:)
 Marchete: you seem better at counting
 MSmits: yes my score counting is perfect, but i sacrificed that box and it made you win
 Marchete: I mean I hardly win you
 MSmits: the nim game is risky
 Marchete: it's your fault
 MSmits: if the board has too many small objects it can make you lose if you also sacrifice boxes
 MSmits: yes it s
 Marchete: you know I didn't want to go D&amp;B
 MSmits: oh ok, yes
 Marchete: I mean talking about D&amp;B
 MSmits: it's fun&#160;:)
 derjack: you keep using that word
 Wontonimo: "i don't think it means what you think it means"
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTRKCXC0JFg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTRKCXC0JFg</a>
 MSmits: heh that movie
 MSmits: i watched it because someone said it is a classic
 MSmits: but it was pretty crappy
 MSmits: willow is a far better movie
 MSmits: nice to see grand nagus zek in there though
 Wontonimo: i'm sorry MSmits, we can no longer be friends
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: you don't like willow?
 Wontonimo: willow was awesome
 MSmits: good
 MSmits: you have taste
 MSmits: maybe it's because i saw princess bride when i was 30+
 MSmits: and willow when i was 10 or something
 MSmits: nostalgia did not enter into it with me with princess bride
 Wontonimo: age plays a big part for sure.  I remember "Highlander" as an awesome movie.  I rewatched it a few years back and man it's shit
 MSmits: ah yes highlander too
 MSmits: the worst part of highlander is when they made the sequal and suddenly they're all aliens from some planet
 MSmits: sequel
 MSmits: made no sense at all
 Wontonimo: yeah, that was just horrible
 MSmits: I preferred the series to the movies tbh
 MSmits: they even made a 3rd movie with actors from the movies and series together
 Wontonimo: there was a series?
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes:  It was far better than the movies at least
 MSmits: reminds me of stargate
 MSmits: series &gt;&gt; movie
 MSmits: people forget there is even a movie
 Wontonimo: avatar
 Astrobytes: didn't really get into SG tbh, movie or series
 MSmits: SG is one of the all time great series
 MSmits: over 10 seasons i think? Or exactly 10
 Wontonimo: the avatar air bender series &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; movie
 MSmits: oh you mean that avatar
 MSmits: not the giant smurf one
 Wontonimo: i couldn't make it through 1/2 of 1 episode of SG
 MSmits: sometimes it takes a bit
 MSmits: i could not make it through breaking bad the first 2 episodes
 derjack: 10 seasons, 5 seasons of atlantis and 2 seasons of universe*
 MSmits: and it's the best series of all time
 MSmits: derjack i liked universe too, was sorry to see it go
 MSmits: atlantis got a bit lame
 derjack: and yes, many episodes from first seasons are cringy
 Astrobytes: SG used to bore me to tears
 derjack: :rage:
 MSmits: farscape was pretty cool too, it might have been more your thing
 MSmits: actually 2 of the actors went into SG1 at the end
 Astrobytes: I mean, there were far (far, far) worse series out there, but it just did nothing for me
 MSmits: babylon 5 was my favorite sci fi when i was young
 Astrobytes: Never got into Farscape either
 21stCenturyPeon: The apex of Series &gt; Movie is still Buffy
 derjack: never watched babylon 5, but watched deep space 9
 Astrobytes: B5 was OK, preferred the ST universe though
 Astrobytes: 21stCenturyPeon: you are not wrong
 MSmits: personally I felt only ds9 was as good as the best of the other sci fi out there. TNG was good but it was mostly good because it had no competition. DS9 trumps it i think
 MSmits: voyager is worse than either of them i feel
 Astrobytes: When it eventually gets going yeah. Last series or 2 of TNG was amazing though
 MSmits: i agree yeah 
 MSmits: I liked St enterprise too
 MSmits: it's not that well known
 Astrobytes: I can take or leave Voyager, some good characters but never really was fulfilling enough
 MSmits: yeah i watched it for the doctor :P
 derjack: or 7
 Astrobytes: Never got into Enterprise tbh, saw a few episodes but just didn't grab me
 MSmits: yeah 7 was cool, but came in later
 derjack: ive only seen the bashed final episode of enterprise
 Astrobytes: 7 eventually became a good character
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Cool when she came back in Picard
 MSmits: there was apparently a lot of conflict about her character
 MSmits: on set i mean
 Astrobytes: Indeed there was.
 Astrobytes: Kate Mulgrew hated her
 MSmits: but they made a good decision bringing her on
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: They got rid of Kes for 7 right?
 MSmits: kate mulgrew was a bit like william shatner on the original star trek I think
 MSmits: i know she left, not sure why
 Astrobytes: Male and bad at acting?
 MSmits: did you hear will weathon talk about william shatner?
 MSmits: he's a reall ass 
 Astrobytes: lol no
 MSmits: wants to be the center of attention
 Astrobytes: I've heard it from some of the other cast though
 Astrobytes: George Takei and William Shatner absolutely detest each other
 Astrobytes: oh lol, found it. "The William F**king Shatner story"
 MSmits: thats it
 MSmits: he also tells it on video
 Astrobytes: Wil Wheaton is a legend
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7cwz7DJ4N8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7cwz7DJ4N8</a>
 MSmits: I love him yeah
 MSmits: he does a channel on boardgames and such i think, not sure if he still does
 Astrobytes: He used to yeah, I remember that
 derjack: shut up weasley
 MSmits: heh thats a ST meme though
 MSmits: right?
 MSmits: well unless you mean harry potter and its not a spelling error
 Astrobytes: Could be either, this is jacek after all
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: do you think he's different when he's on his upside down pony?
 derjack: personnaly i dont know why, but weasley crusher was most hated character 
 MSmits: pony did not catch on to the spelling error i think
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 The_Camoflauged: i am 13
 MSmits: unlucky
 Astrobytes: Good for you.
 derjack: oh i was reading about weasels
 MSmits: as one does
 The_Camoflauged: IKR 13 unlucky number
 Astrobytes: Video's great MSmits
 MSmits: yeah that's why i remembered it
 Wontonimo: just state your age in hex and it just doesn't seem unlucky anymore The_Camoflauged
 Wontonimo: you are D years old
 MSmits: I knew it
 MSmits: he appeared and I thought: This person is a D
 Wontonimo: Dangerous, Dubious, Deadily.  That's what I'd always tell my parents what D means when i gave them my report card
 The_10x_Engineer: Hello chat 😀
 martinpapa69: hi
 MSmits: now here's an obvious A
 Wontonimo: he he
 Wontonimo: There are 10 kinds of people in the world.  Those who understand binary and those who don't
 The_10x_Engineer: good one
 Wontonimo: hey The_10x_Engineer , check out the multis (bot battles) and challenges.  There is way more than just Clash of Code
 Wontonimo: This was the last multi that you can still play <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 Wontonimo: *contest
 The_10x_Engineer: Wontonimo I do a lot besides Clash of Code lmao
 The_10x_Engineer: But thanks lol
 Wontonimo: no problem.  you can count on me for useless and unneeded suggestions.  just drop me a line anytime and I've got plenty.  Flush even
 Tiramon: always fascinating when you watch a NN learn and see the results improving =)
 ThereIsFunInFuneral--Jewelery: ls -l
 Marchete: yours?
 Tiramon: just tried to set up a little backend i can run on one of my servers and monitor from outsideand currently started training a NN from scratch =)
 Wontonimo: nice
 <b>**Wontonimo i wish i had "servers"</b></p><p><img src="/a/12287237914571" /> Tiramon: agent is playing against himself and had an avg score of 45 for quite some time on oware
 Tiramon: but he still has a 6% chance to end the game with an invalid move&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: valid move constraint should not be up to the NN.
 Tiramon: it is not ... it's just a stat i monitor
 Wontonimo: ah
 Tiramon: i currently monitor avg score, win ratio, avg invalid and avg time per game
 Wontonimo: well, there is a difference between "man i'd really like to be able to just remove the opponents queen" and "i am technically able to".  Depending on how you are training it, it can learn the first instead of the second
 Wontonimo: i know we arn't talking chess... just an analogy 
 The_10x_Engineer: Where is Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: i never got around to it
 Tiramon: if i'm not completling wrong it just tries to get the highest possible score which should result in a high win ratio
 Tiramon: *completly
 The_10x_Engineer: Oh nevermind he's still here :o
 Wontonimo: highest score would be by cheating
 Tiramon: except when the agent plays against himself ... then ration should stay around 50%
 Wontonimo: so, yeah, take the enemy queen when they arn't looking
 Tiramon: game rules don't allow cheating ... so he hast to reach highest score with valid moves&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: absolutely.  what i mean is, if you are teaching it which moves to prefer and that is disconnected from valid moves, then it will suggest a move that isn't valid.  That's okay, that's why you have constraints.  I don't know if how i'm saying this is clear
 Wontonimo: or maybe i dont understand what you mean by 6% chance of an invalid move
 Tiramon: in 6% of his games he currently thinks at some point that doing a invalid move is the best choice ...
 Tiramon: guess because in some game situations you have no choice to win and just have to do any move ... this ratio will never go to 0 because it does not matter if he does a invalid move and lose or a valid move and lose
 Wontonimo: oh interesting.  it's basically flipping the table
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Tiramon: if i only have 1 seed in my first house ..i can't make a move to win so it does not matter if i take the seed from house 1 and move it to 2 and opponent has no valid move and i loseor i pick an empty house and loose because i made an invalid move
 Wontonimo: makes sense
 Tiramon: but hey after 1.3k games it is currently reduced to 3% so there was still some space&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: do you block backprop of invalid moves, or do you mix the learning of preferred moves and valid moves?
 Tiramon: i currently use a random sample of moves made to learni think the one i submited had a prioritized experience replay
 Tiramon: the one i currently run is just a DQN with experience replay
 Tiramon: hm the agent has probably learned to avoid situtations that result in a invalid move =) was at 0% for a short time&#160;;)
 MSmits: Marchete I implemented your hash thingy
 MSmits: it seems to be similar in performance to unordered set
 MSmits: and 4 or 5 seems to work fine as a number of times to keep searching for a free spot
 MSmits: your way seems to be slightly better even
 MSmits: about 5%
 MSmits: seems to be quite sensitive to the capacity. If I set it too low and dont have enough space, speed plummets
 derjack: DQN? so its still no search?
 MSmits: what do you mean DQN?
 derjack: double q-learning network
 Astrobytes: Deep-Q Network
 derjack: or deep hmm
 Wontonimo: Dairy Queen Numerology
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: I have none of those things
 MSmits: I was just talking about the simple hash scheme Astrobytes explained to me expanded with the loop Marchete told me about
 MSmits: basically if you dont find your item, you look x more times near it
 MSmits: and also when you insert, if the space is occupied by another item, you look x more times for an empty spot
 Astrobytes: I think he was talking to Tiramon&#160;;)
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: why do people talk to other people, dont they know everythign is about me
 Astrobytes: :D
 Marchete: I won't talk anymore without my lawyer present
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I did it right though Marchete? this is what you meant
 MSmits: including the time required blowing up when you have too little capacity
 Marchete: yes, and at insert you need to make an special case for all places filled
 MSmits: whats the special case?
 MSmits: just not inserting?
 Marchete: either you randomly add it at any point (not at end always)
 MSmits: how do you find it, if you randomly add it?
 Marchete: or if lossless then make some extra steps
 Marchete: to save it
 Marchete: random [0..5]
 Marchete: inside your bucket size
 MSmits: ok, so you do add it?
 MSmits: currently i just dont add it
 MSmits: isnt it better to just add it at 0 then?  Then you can find it better next time
 Marchete: it depends on your needs
 Marchete: but as a rule of thumb, new hashes should be more important
 MSmits: if you're going to replace another item, you might as well do it at 0
 Marchete: always 0?
 MSmits: yeah why not
 Marchete: then the rest of the bucket won't update ever
 MSmits: i dont understand
 MSmits: it's not a buckey
 MSmits: bucket
 Marchete: I do a limited range check
 Marchete: hash -&gt; array pos
 MSmits: i count up 5 times
 Marchete: then pos .. pos+4
 MSmits: that doesnt make those 5 times a bucket
 Marchete: well
 MSmits: because buckets will overlap
 Marchete: a ranged search
 Marchete: I prefer not to overwrite insert at the same place always
 MSmits: what i mean is, that 0 position is only a 0 position to that particular key
 Marchete: because that makes the range less useless
 MSmits: another key might have a 0 position 1 step below that, or 2 steps above it
 Marchete: it is
 MSmits: so if the 0 is only 0 to that key, why would random be better
 MSmits: I should just try both ways
 Marchete: maybe your hashing sucks and you have a lot of collisions
 Marchete: like always using 99999
 Marchete: but not 99998
 MSmits: ohh, good point
 MSmits: when hashing sucks it does matter yes
 MSmits: the 0 might be popular
 Marchete: it means even if you add a big range
 MSmits: it's better to just try it though
 Marchete: all collisions will be to 0
 MSmits: true, but the disadvantage of inserting at 2 is that you can be 100% sure you need the loop when you do the lookup
 Marchete: trust me, I have no idea about what I'm talking about
 derjack: youre hired
 MSmits: if at 0, there's at least a chance you dont need the loop
 Marchete: imo fixed index insert defeats the purpose of ranged search
 MSmits: I'll try it
 MSmits: inserting at 0 gave no advantage to not inserting at all btw, trying the random thing now
 Marchete: meanwhile I'll try to beat you at D&amp;B
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 derjack: no clobber?
 Marchete: done! I can go eat something :D
 Marchete: I just need to fix all the damn bugs
 MSmits: yep inserting at random is better
 Marchete: how do you check it?
 MSmits: basically i create 1000 nim boards at around ply 47
 Marchete: I did by intuition but I never checked it
 MSmits: then solve them all
 MSmits: using whatever hash scheme i want
 MSmits: and just look at the time
 MSmits: I also use this check to see if i make errors
 MSmits: when i change my solver
 MSmits: it reads the 1000 solutions from file and checks the solver to see if they are all identical
 MSmits: D&amp;B is difficult and you make wrong assumptions, this check will spot them
 MSmits: say I always play grounded short strings before non-grounded ones and i put that in as a rule
 MSmits: then the solver will give errors
 MSmits: some rules are correct, some arent
 AllYourTrees: in C4 are you supposed to steal 1 and 7?
 MSmits: the cool thing is that it should not matter whether you steal them or not 
 MSmits: because it is a balanced move
 MSmits: maybe not 100% balanced for every bot, but I am pretty sure they are solved as draw if you have enough computation power
 MSmits: but so is TTT and player 1 still has a significant advantage
 Oppaimaster: bebus
 Astrobytes: oh give it a rest kid
 bebus: bebus
 Astrobytes: Ban next.
 codeing: holla
 codeing: just get a question 
 Tiramon: isn't it a bit late for school in uk?
 Astrobytes: 2pm?
 derjack: on vacation?
 Tiramon: probably some vacation activity...
 Oppaimaster: its school 
 Astrobytes: They're breaking up for holidays around now in England
 Tiramon: ok so last days before holidays ... that need to be filled somehow ...
 Astrobytes: Scottish schools broke up around 27th June
 Stefanuk12: :sunglasses:
 derjack: scottish kids eh

 Oppaimaster: bebusssssssssssss
 eulerscheZahl: wow
 Astrobytes: Bye bye bebus. And stop DMing me.
 Matilda-bit: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 eulerscheZahl: what a time to come online
 Astrobytes: Indeed. Moin.
 bebus: i havnt DMed you though?
 bebus: anyway
 bebus: BEBUS
 derjack: bah

 eulerscheZahl: minimax? mcts?
 Astrobytes: MCTS
 Astrobytes: I have no clue how to eval Clobber
 eulerscheZahl: i have no clue what the rules are :D
 Astrobytes: Last player standing, you have to 'clobber' your opponents stones, you can move UDRL
 eulerscheZahl: ah, so jacek ran out of moves
 eulerscheZahl: any rule changes in the higher league?
 Astrobytes: iirc it's the same rules
 eulerscheZahl: just a boss for the puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: Boss is just there to filter random bots
 SoulNinja: :mhm:
 SoulNinja: discord.gg/twt
 Astrobytes: Stop it SoulNinja
 SoulNinja: lol ok
 Astrobytes: And to ensure POTW ofc yes&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: have you tried stone count as an eval Astrobytes?
 Wontonimo: for clobber
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Wontonimo: or liberty count as an eval?
 eulerscheZahl: "stone count", nice trolling
 Wontonimo: ah ... it wasn't meant to be a troll, but now that i'm looking at a replay, it doesn't make sense since each player losing 1 stone per round until the end&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: perhaps liberty count could work
 eulerscheZahl: or the almighty NN
 Wontonimo: if only there was a way to discover repeating patters in 3x3 or 5x5 patches by some kind of weight combination and activiation function
 Astrobytes: I think I had mobility/liberty iirc
 MSmits: can islands be solved separately?
 MSmits: I know they can in D&amp;B
 Astrobytes: If you go the minimax route (or combinatorial) you want to divide into sub games
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits
 MSmits: well then you need to solve them and calculate the nimsum
 Astrobytes: There's a paper on it, nimbers and such
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf">https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf</a>
 MSmits: split up the board until you no longer can, calculate the nimvalue of all possible moves, and return the mex
 MSmits: i remember seeing that. Did not understand it back then
 Astrobytes: Bit of Sprague-Grundy goes a long way eh
 MSmits: right
 N0T-Harold: hey
 MSmits: hi Harold
 Astrobytes: He's !Harold
 MSmits: sorry, easy mistake to make
 eulerscheZahl: let's call him John then. Hi John
 martinpapa69: Hisyoung
 MSmits: hey eulerscheZahl, what are you up to?
 eulerscheZahl: nothing special
 eulerscheZahl: tried to get back to CGFunge again
 MSmits: oh
 eulerscheZahl: halfway through but now I lack motivation
 eulerscheZahl: and was ill during the weekend
 MSmits: ahh ok, that's why you werent here
 eulerscheZahl: no, i just stopped caring
 MSmits: ah&#160;:(
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: hard-coding CGF?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 jacek: huh
 N0T-Harold: i dont know
 FinFree: anybody here rn?
 FinFree: how do i change programming language if i want to play clash?
 Wontonimo: it is a dropdown at the top of your screen
 Wontonimo: center top
 FinFree: thank you
 FinFree: my man
 Wontonimo: after this class, try something else.  there are lots of really cool challenges and bot battles
 Wontonimo: the bot battles are A LOT more fun than Clashes
 Wontonimo: Try this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 Wontonimo: when you are done.  Feel free to ask questions to get started
 LolJuki1234: :mhm:
 Wontonimo: for anyone interested in MCTS insights: "the grandparent heuristic" is garbage for UTTT
 jacek: oh my
 Wontonimo: i just removed it.  my bot went from 29th and is now doing better climbing to 25th
 LolJuki1234: :ok_hand_tone1:
 AllYourTrees: what is grandparent heuristic?
 Wontonimo: garbagepre-seed the Node score with the score of parent-&gt;parent 
 Wontonimo: the rational is that most likely the players next move is going to have a score similar to their previous move
 LolJuki1234: :ok_hand_tone1::ok_hand_tone1:
 Wontonimo: i've had it in my MCTS code for months without quesiton.  i think it did work better when I was doing multiple rollouts per expansion.
 Wontonimo: but on a hunch, i thought "really, how certain can the grandparent be anyway, maybe 5 or 10 visits"
 Wontonimo: which probably means it is completely unreliable 
 Wontonimo: perhaps with someone with a 200+ branching factor it would be useful
 Wontonimo: *something
 jacek: uttt is really context dependent
 jacek: no rave would work either
 Wontonimo: +1
 reCurse: As with most advice, what works on one bot may not work on another
 jacek: you mean game
 reCurse: Implied
 MSmits: bot too
 MSmits: something may work in one bot and not within another
 MSmits: due to other stuff
 reCurse:&#160;? I just said that
 Astrobytes: I think he was backing your statement&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: hmph
 Marchete: I'm 260th but sometimes I can win top10 :rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: just playing out the endgame properly should get you top 20 or so i think
 Marchete: except if I constantly crash
 MSmits: or not even perfectly, just keeping control
 MSmits: btw i had a question about your graphs
 MSmits: do you have a graph with strings and coins?
 MSmits: so the coins are an object and the strings are as well 
 MSmits: and if so, do you merge strings to create 1 string for a multiple connected ones
 Marchete: I never merge
 Marchete: I split
 MSmits: well of course when you cut strings nodes become disconnected
 MSmits: but what i mean is, as soon as a node has only 2 connections, it could be merged with other nodes with only 2 connections, like chains
 MSmits: so that you have only 1 object of size x
 Marchete: I don't understand well
 MSmits: let me try and draw something sec
 jacek: :scream:
 Marchete: I have bitEdge , bitBox, and staticEdge and staticBox
 jacek: beatbox
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/9NFWnz0">https://imgur.com/a/9NFWnz0</a>
 MSmits: my endgame solver does this
 Marchete: I'll review it later
 Astrobytes: It makes necklaces and pendants?
 MSmits: yes :P
 Marchete: right now I can't
 MSmits: I've been thinking about mikla's bot
 MSmits: we nimsolve nearly at the same time
 MSmits: yet he is way more often in control at the end, it solves as win for him
 MSmits: so i am wondering if he does something else, earlier, to raise his chances
 MSmits: no idea what though
 MSmits: Marchete I think I finished my special mcts
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e39edea-cdcc-4326-880b-783fdaa06c87">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e39edea-cdcc-4326-880b-783fdaa06c87</a>
 MSmits: thats what it made
 MSmits: this happens when my bot tries to focus on these kinds of maps and the opponent plays randomly
 MSmits: this would be horrible for mikla
 MSmits: here's another:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fe514a6-0608-4b86-8e89-29a077109b3c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fe514a6-0608-4b86-8e89-29a077109b3c</a>
 MSmits: fairly consistent
 AllYourTrees: is there almost a collaborative aspect to D&amp;B? both players are trying to build long chains, but i guess at a certain point they are trying to make sure they can use the chains and not the opponent?
 MSmits: not exactly, there's a rule that says player A needs an odd number of long chains and player B needs an even number. Or the other way around, not sure
 MSmits: so it's not true that both of them try to get as many long chains as possible
 MSmits: what you try to be is the player that has the last safe move
 MSmits: because then the other player is forced to start one of the chains, giving you the boxes
 MSmits: the player that made the last safe move is said to be "in control"
 MSmits: or that he made a move resulting in nimber value 0

 reCurse: Wishing them the best
 struct: yeah, I saw some stuff before about chessbase using their engine and renaming it
 Astrobytes: Shady gits
 reCurse: fat fraud
 MSmits: ugh... now I somehow need to merg a 500 line mcts with a bot thats already 2.5k lines. So messy
 MSmits: cg limit are definitely meant for using multiple search algorithms in the same bot
 MSmits: definitely not
 reCurse: You need a preprocess step for your bots
 MSmits: you mean like work in seperate files and then merge them?
 MSmits: automatically?
 reCurse: Anything that goes through your source and then has the possibility to discard code you don't need
 reCurse: That way you keep more locally
 reCurse: Could be a ifdef-like
 Wontonimo: i use a python file to strip and combine my cpp files for CG
 reCurse: e.g. My bundler looks for stuff like // BUNDLE_IGNORE_START and // BUNDLE_IGNORE_END
 MSmits: for D&amp;B I have 3 completely different projects
 MSmits: well 4 actually
 MSmits: this mcts, a nim solver, a score solver and the combination is the bot on CG
 BlaiseEbuth: You're impure Wontonimo
 BlaiseEbuth: My merger is also in c++
 MSmits: my main problem is variable naming
 reCurse: C++ is unfortunately terrible to handle text out of the box
 MSmits: when merging
 reCurse: Mine is in C#
 BlaiseEbuth: Some regex do well
 reCurse: Regex can go diaf
 BlaiseEbuth: diaf?
 reCurse: die in a fire
 MSmits: die in :fire:
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh ^^
 Wontonimo: i love regex :heart:
 reCurse: We're no longer friends
 BlaiseEbuth: Matter of habit I suppose...
 MSmits: :broken_heart:
 Wontonimo: we were?  oh wow, achievement unlocked
 BlaiseEbuth: Put it on your profile, I have some good ones :3
 MSmits: funny
 MSmits: it looks real BlaiseEbuth
 MSmits: maybe could be a bit bigger
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Got a little display issue. Will take a looke at it
 Wontonimo: oh, i like your achievements
 reCurse: "Disliked by reCurse" bronze level
 BlaiseEbuth: An easy one
 Wontonimo: "part of the tutorial"
 MSmits: :grin:
 Wontonimo: rules change all the way to legend
 Marchete: MSmits can you share the image again?
 Marchete: I lost that part of the chat
 BlaiseEbuth: NSFW?
 Marchete: yeah
 Wontonimo: -()-()-()- = -(3)-
 Wontonimo: that's it
 Wontonimo: or was it another image?
 Astrobytes: I still have it open:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/9NFWnz0">https://imgur.com/a/9NFWnz0</a>

 BlaiseEbuth: Ben wa balls he...
 MSmits: do you mean the imgur or the pastebinned chat with maps of D&amp;B end games 
 MSmits: Marchete
 Marchete: dunno, the img 30 min ago
 Marchete: or so
 MSmits: oh thats what Astrobytes shared
 Marchete: great artist
 Marchete: and what was the question?
 MSmits: well whether it would be a good idea to merge stuff like that
 Marchete: or PM if you like
 MSmits: saves you time in floodfilling and such
 Marchete: to not break the chat
 MSmits: sure
 jacek: not floodfilling the chat eh
 borrel: time for a nice old-school chat worm virus :sunglasses: /
 borrel: s
 BlaiseEbuth: :snake:
 Astrobytes: that's a snek Blaise
 BlaiseEbuth: No worm emoji.
 BlaiseEbuth: Ask tibo

 Retroblaze: hi
 jacek: ohai
 struct: potw done
 jacek: now do the yinsh potw
 struct: I would need to make a bot for it&#160;:/
 struct: clobber bot is just copy paste from breakthrough bot
 jacek: eval as well?
 struct: no eval
 struct: just full rollout
 struct: ept is used in clobber right?
 jacek: i bet mostly good old mcts. milka uses some math
 Retroblaze: How do you get good at programming?
 Astrobytes: 1... 2... 3... - altogether now:Practice;
 Retroblaze: what do you use to practice?
 Astrobytes: In what way?
 Astrobytes: General problem solving? Logic? Learning a particular language?
 Retroblaze: well how do you get good at clashes?
 Astrobytes: I don't clash.
 Retroblaze: what do you do?
 Astrobytes: Multiplayer bot programming, some optimisation, some puzzles

 Astrobytes: struct: nice Clobber&#160;:)
 struct: thanks
 struct: I should try pruning moves
 Retroblaze: cool Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Retroblaze: Stick with easy puzzles at first if you do those, there's no time limit (unlike clashes)
 Retroblaze: okay, thanks
 Retroblaze: ill try them out
 struct: forgot to use 1 sec as p2 on first turn, should not matter much though
 Astrobytes: Cool, good luck. Thor, Temperatures and The Descent are good to start with if you haven't done them Retroblaze
 Retroblaze: alright, will do
 Astrobytes: struct: For top you need nim solver
 struct: nim solver here aswell?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, see who's first&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf">https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf</a>
 struct: thanks
 jacek: i dont use any of this... nim
 struct: is it NN jacek?
 Astrobytes: Of course.
 jacek: what else
 jacek: but something is off
 jacek: it often says 0.9 score just to prove a lose 1 turn later
 jacek: but it is strong nonetheless
 Astrobytes: Definitely. My dumb bot beat you earlier.
 BlaiseEbuth: That deaf, dumb, and blind bot sure plays a mean Clobber.
 jacek: but can it play blindfold chess
 Astrobytes: It's a Clobber wizard, there has to be a twist
 BlaiseEbuth: \o/
 Astrobytes: "Since I was a young bot, I played with coloured stones"

 Astrobytes: Let's make an album (and movie) called Botty
 BlaiseEbuth: Do we have to destroy the chat at the end&#160;?
 Astrobytes: A virtual one perhaps.

 MSmits: frame 57
 MSmits: look at the layout
 MSmits: this is on purpose
 jacek: meh
 jacek: you say 24-25 but ends up with 27
 MSmits: thats because they make mistakes
 MSmits: in the end game
 jacek: you should predict their mistakes
 struct: MSmits on clobber do you prune moves or use ept?
 Astrobytes: They? Ille is a team! :o
 MSmits: wouldnt that be useful eh&#160;?
 struct: or is just normal mcts
 MSmits: clobber was written in less than a day
 MSmits: like c4
 MSmits: so nothing weird
 struct: yeah took me 2 hours
 MSmits: you can use my bot as a benchmark for good performance &amp; no bells and whistles
 jacek: hes already above you
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: good
 jacek: and milka is using math there
 MSmits: milka is a chocolate brand
 jacek: and is using math there
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: I think he's using that deliberately
 AllYourTrees: MSmits how many rollouts are you getting 1st turn for clobber?
 struct: ban math
 MSmits: i rollout from each child AllYourTrees
 MSmits: so it's a bad measurement
 AllYourTrees: oh so do i
 struct: how many allyourtrees?
 MSmits: let me go check then
 AllYourTrees: expand all children &amp; do 1 full random rollout
 AllYourTrees: for each
 struct: I do that
 MSmits: ok, but your rollout count, is this for all of them separately? Or counted as 1
 struct: I get like 1.5 - 1.8 Million
 AllYourTrees: all of them separately
 MSmits: ohh ok
 AllYourTrees: darn you struct
 MSmits: meh it's not enough to beat mikla. I do get a lot of close games this way but only rarely win
 MSmits: kinda funny it influences the shape of the map like this though
 jacek: you should take a break and eat some bacon
 MSmits: why bacon though?
 MSmits: oh
 jacek:  
 MSmits: got it&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 Marchete: :bacon:

 Illedan: Did you NN d&amp;b?
 MSmits: huh no, not me
 Illedan: Did 1st player do it?
 MSmits: no, he's just using math
 MSmits: i am too, but he's using it better
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: thats why he is also nr 1 at clobber
 Astrobytes: you should ask him some more questions MSmits, he was qquite forthcoming last time
 MSmits: they are both math games
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i will if i see him
 MSmits: but i'd feel bad if he gives away and I club him over the head with it :P
 MSmits: could just be 1 little thing
 Astrobytes: Then he can ask you questions&#160;;)
 MSmits: true
 Illedan: On that lead it has to be more than 1 thing :P 
 Illedan: Not just a +1 somewhere
 MSmits: not really, I made a change in my bot the other day that allowed me to solve 7 plies earlier, making my bot over 1000 times faster
 MSmits: he solves 1 ply earlier than me
 Astrobytes: Illedan: off-topic, but whatever did you do with your snake game you made for your work colleagues a while back?
 Illedan: Was used for 2 social evenings
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8462468ed0113b37c6abb9f1a25ad764b388cc">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8462468ed0113b37c6abb9f1a25ad764b388cc</a>
 Illedan: Most Norwegian leaderboard xD
 MSmits: what does Bekk mean
 Illedan: Company name
 MSmits: oh
 Mazia: ello govners
 Astrobytes: lol, who could have predicted that winner eh
 Illedan: I didnt participate
 Illedan: This is my test bot to validate the game :P
 Astrobytes: ah lol
 MSmits: nice test
 Astrobytes: Top was close
 MSmits: not to the test :P
 MSmits: they failed the test
 Illedan: Very few games in contribution&#160;:(
 MSmits: ah yes
 Illedan: Oh, nvm I was wrong. Ille-Stream is my test bot
 Illedan: nr1 is some serious stuff to cursh them xD
 Illedan: *crush
 MSmits: haha
 Astrobytes: Oh lol, didn't even notice Ille-Stream bot
 MSmits: I'd make a game if i could use it to crush my coworkers too
 Illedan: Should I move it to public with a real name and make it a contribution?
 Astrobytes: I reckon so yeah
 Illedan: Basically snake :P 
 Illedan: But I feel more like making it an Optim
 Illedan: like 2048
 Illedan: with known seed
 Illedan: to finish the game fastest
 Astrobytes: Hmmm, that's an interesting idea
 Astrobytes: I'll leave the choice to you but it's definitely publishable
 Illedan: hm hm hm. Optim or multi. Which is more fun?
 Astrobytes: Depends which day of the week it is
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Friday for optim?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: You could do both? I donno, might be pointless
 Astrobytes: Push to public anyway and ask for opinions
 Illedan: Ok, will fix tomorrow. thx for reminding me&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I just remembered earlier when Blaise posted a snake emoji
 MSmits: you make that sound like a milestone :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: i'll make it a point to post random animals occasionally to see if it does something for you
 Astrobytes: hahaha! Please, be my guest
 Illedan: Make it a multi and allow players to jump and swap direction? xD
 MSmits: jump?
 Illedan: *dig then
 Illedan: go below ground 1 tile and then up again
 MSmits: blaise was talking about worms earlier
 MSmits: that fits 
 Astrobytes: ooh, burrowing. Interesting mechanic
 Illedan: Maybe just too much
 Illedan: 2p, 3p, 4p?
 Astrobytes: Hm. 4p might be too much.
 ArunJayaraman: /me
 Illedan: yeah, too few turns
 Illedan: But 2p is basically just an optim
 Illedan: or Tron 2
 Illedan: This game has the best story :D
 MSmits: tron?
 Illedan: my snake
 MSmits: the story of how you wrecked your coworkers?
 Illedan: There is a story part below most games you know?
 Illedan: In the rules
 MSmits: oh that one, let me go read
 Astrobytes: Yeah. 3p then I guess. Unless optim. Sooo ask for ideas in the contribution I guess would be the best idea.
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: the cake is a lie
 Illedan: :tada:
 MSmits: the story too :P
 Illedan: You get the reference?
 Astrobytes: When life gives ya lemons
 MSmits: well it's a meme
 Illedan: From the Portal game
 Illedan: oooh, I should make a portal game
 Illedan: hmmm
 Illedan: but, basically Sokoban
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Make life take the lemons back! get Mad!!
 Illedan: meh, too little time
 codeing: holla all
 Illedan: Learning Unity these days
 Astrobytes: I got it
 MSmits: oh thats cool Illedan
 codeing: just get a question gays
 Astrobytes: For anything interesting?
 MSmits: did you do the catlike coding tutorials?
 Illedan: Might get to do game dev for work if I can prove myself&#160;:)
 codeing: does rubik's cube solving make more logic&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Oh very nice&#160;:)
 codeing: 7 * 7
 codeing: 7 * 7 rubik's cude
 Illedan: Hope the contest on monday is nice&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh right
 Astrobytes: Oh I forgot about that
 Illedan: So, Optim for Snake. To get done with it by monday. Done deal
 codeing: answer me :smiling_imp:
 codeing: does 7 *7 rubik's cube solving make more logic&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hehehe, sounds good to me Illedan
 Astrobytes: codeing: if your question made any sense we would answer it
 MSmits: ye it's not making any logic
 jacek: what's 49 rubic cube?
 codeing: Does the resolution of the 7 * 7 rubik cube make the developer more logical?
 codeing: in 2 minutes
 MSmits: are you asking if solving a 7x7 rubiks cube trains you to write better algorithms&#160;?
 codeing: sure
 codeing: yeah
 MSmits: if you do it by using algorithms then yes, but there are probably better ways to practice this general skill
 Astrobytes: if it's 7x7 you can do that on paper :P
 jacek: yeah make NN for it
 Illedan: Anyway, I'm off. Hope ya all are ready for Snake party tomorrow night
 Illedan: Damn, that sounded wrong
 Illedan: Ignore me

 MSmits: nim games being all or nothing kinda makes this seem correct
 MSmits: it just did a wrong guess
 MSmits: did not know that show Astrobytes
 MSmits: but i've seen the actor around shows by jimmy carr
 Astrobytes: Peep Show and That Mitchell And Webb Look are worth a watch, ask dbdr
 MSmits: dbdr watches peep show?
 Astrobytes: I recommended one or the other to him a while back
 MSmits: ah
 Astrobytes: He knew one already
 MysteriousCarpet_a2d2: hello
 LazyMammal: Anyone else getting timeouts on UTTT multi league arena?
 Astrobytes: Are you leaving a 3-5ms buffer for your timer?
 LazyMammal: Yeah, I leave a bit of room already. Today I'm only timing out on the first move.  I'm also seeing my opponents time out but I'm not sure if that's normal for them.  I'm looking at Legend league.
 struct: you need to start the timer after reading the first input
 Astrobytes: I don't have a UTTT bot but things seem SNAFU as per usual multi-wise. What changes have you made today?
 LazyMammal: I had that problem struct you're right.  Fixed that up right away once I found it. Spent too long tweaking the bot offline and forgot a couple things :D
 Astrobytes: Ah lol, I checked your level and figured you knew that already :D
 LazyMammal: Haha yeah.  Well I ruled out the obvious and I was just wondering if anyone else was having trouble.
 Astrobytes: hehehe, it happens!
 Micheeey: whats up
 Astrobytes: the opposite of up last time I checked :P
 Astrobytes: *down DOWN FML
 Astrobytes: Clearly too much time in CG chat today
 Astrobytes: So whats up for me? I'm tired!
 Astrobytes: RoboStac: I beat you twice in a row, it must be a bad submit
 RoboStac: it's a baby nn, it doesn't know what it's doing yet
 Astrobytes: Ah OK. Great 
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: which game?
 Astrobytes: Clobber
 RoboStac: it's at least not claiming the enemy is cheating and making invalid moves anymore
 RoboStac: so I think my sim is correct
 Astrobytes: lol, that's a positive start&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Gonna be tough to wreck miklla
 struct: There seems to be a few tricks to reduce branching
 Astrobytes: (generally I mean, not on this submit)
 Astrobytes: Divide and conquer is the name of this game really 
 struct: ill still try to finish breakthrough first though
 Astrobytes: I hate that game. I may convert to EPT.
 struct: I have a few bugs on the arena version
 struct: I would try EPT
 struct: you probably wont have to change a lot of code
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not a big job, just tedious&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Hm. Still I'm making these invalid actions. Damn bugs.
 Astrobytes: Submit looks nice struct
 struct: my random starting seed could start at 0
 struct: so it would always return 0
 struct: ...
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: I wonder if mikla just nim solves
 MSmits: and plays random before
 MSmits: on clobber
 struct: I have same bug on bt ....
 struct: I guess ill resubmit there too
 Astrobytes: I doubt that MSmits but nothing is impossible
 Astrobytes: defo nim solving but random?
 MSmits: what else to do?
 MSmits: does it matter what you do in the first 20 plies?
 MSmits: are there clear ways to eval?
 Astrobytes: Perhaps not if we all play in that way
 Astrobytes: Otherwise there are gains to be made
 MSmits: just wondering what they are
 Astrobytes: it's mostly groupings afaict
 MSmits: you eval groupings?
 Astrobytes: I eval nothing
 MSmits: no i mean the general you
 MSmits: not you the friendly scotsman
 Astrobytes: yeah, like the islands
 MSmits: but thats what you nimsolve
 MSmits: the island
 Astrobytes: yeah, but you can eval the pre-island configuration surely
 Astrobytes: To obtain optimal islands
 MSmits: I guess
 MSmits: seems like such a short game
 MSmits: been watching too many D&amp;B replays
 Astrobytes: Hey I'm just thinking out loud
 Astrobytes: I could be wrong
 MSmits: yeah I dont know how to think about it at all
 MSmits: I would guess you nim solve it at the end and use NN before that
 MSmits: or something
 MSmits: seems hard to write a good eval
 MSmits: I see that there are differences in mobility
 MSmits: well no not really, every move can be reversed
 Astrobytes: All you have to know about this game is even trictrac had to make a MCTS
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: are they all using mcts then?
 Astrobytes: afaik everyone is MCTS, I could be wrong, it's possible to be lower in the league with ab minimax
 MSmits: i guess the players that perform better do pruning in some way
 MSmits: I can already see some equivalent moves
 Astrobytes: There seem to be numerous pruning possibilities, couldn't tell you which are optimal though
 MSmits: well two equivalent moves can always be pruned. It's just that detecting them might be too expensive
 Astrobytes: *Might* or may save you a bunch of trouble. Has to be tested
 MSmits: yep
 struct: cant beat any NN&#160;:(
 MSmits: mikla can do it&#160;:)
 struct: i meant in bt
 MSmits: oh, right
 struct: i resubmited there with 2 small bug fixes
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: nice
 struct: I still have some more things to do there
 struct: I have one function ready to solve sooner
 struct: im not sure if its worth to check for zugzwang
 struct: I know it can happen but never seen it on cg
 Astrobytes: It's weird, I do a small null move pruning in BT and without it my bot is much worse.
 Astrobytes: (in all versions, not just my current shit one)
 struct: I prune some moves
 struct: but only for me
 struct: for opponent I take into account all
 Astrobytes: wtf I'm 24th in Oware
 struct: you got pushed down?
 Astrobytes: I most certainly did yes
 struct: Ah many submits from the same palyer
 struct: can do that
 Astrobytes: Getting back to a decent position is a lot harder now with all the NNs, still cool though
 Astrobytes: More of a case of about 5 people with NNs submitting
 Astrobytes: gotta say csip/martinpapa and old john both have done well in there recently
 Astrobytes: anyway, off to bed, gn all
 struct: gn
 Husoski: sweet dreams!
 DogCat: struct, how can i to participate of Arena without write my country?
 OBenjOne: What other games are there similar to coders strike back where the game is more focused on physics than on a board-game strategy feel? I really enjoyed coders strike back and mars lander so any more similar to that would be really cool

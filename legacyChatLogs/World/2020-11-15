 ClockSort: yeah in C# I went with "Agent" instead. Much better.
 EladYaniv01: how do i identify which player am i&#160;? in python 
 EladYaniv01: i notice my bot works only when i am to the left
 Zenoscave: you're always player 0 for the input
 EladYaniv01: no i am not, not in the arena ...
 Zenoscave: it may not look like it but the input always gives your info first
 EladYaniv01: okay, thanks
 Bobbadillio: You might be player 0, but the action_ids change depending on whether you're the first or second player (your info IS first though)
 Bobbadillio: that messed me up once :D 
 Zenoscave: Next 2 lines: 5 integers to describe each player, your data is always fi
 Zenoscave: first*
 EladYaniv01: ohhh
 EladYaniv01: the action_id's 
 Bobbadillio: I just hard coded "oh, my cast for 2 blue is always 82!" and it turns out that's not real
 EladYaniv01: are the problem yeah
 EladYaniv01: yeah 
 EladYaniv01: same 
 EladYaniv01: :S
 Zenoscave: Your's always say CAST
 Zenoscave: opp says OPPONENT_CAST
 Bobbadillio: SO, the initial action IDs ARE always 78-81 and then 82-85, and you can find out which is which like Zeno said
 Bobbadillio: This is ALSO part of what makes my current bot hacky
 Zenoscave: The game is completely symmetric.  It doesn't matter which bot is on which side
 Zenoscave: just only cast id's whose action types are CAST
 EladYaniv01: it does if i hard corded a spell book before hand 
 morning_cloud: EladYaniv01 you can identify your player by action_type in the input
 EladYaniv01: based on training only to the left
 Zenoscave: Then hard code the deltas, not the ids
 EladYaniv01: CAST ##
 Zenoscave: I give up
 Bobbadillio: On what
 Zenoscave: helping
 Bobbadillio: :thumbsup:
 JinxDaCat: Anybody else periodically have muscle-memory kick in and after making some changes hit Ctrl+S to save?  lol.
 Bobbadillio: All the time&#160;:)
 EX53: for anyone else is it saying you run out of time but its in the middle of the action count loop
 EX53: ive been trying to fix this for hours idk what to do
 Bobbadillio: That doesn't happen to me, no. Did you modify it in any way from the initially given code?
 EX53: ya but like i make an object and put it in an arraylist
 EX53: but that shouldnt take 50 ms
 EX53: and ive seen other streamers do the same thing and it works fin for them
 EX53: i think its a bug or something is there someone i can ask for help?
 EX53: this is the only reason i havent moved up
 Bobbadillio: I don't think there's any good place to ask, no
 EX53: ah that sucks
 EX53: its in java
 EX53: ive seen another streamer do the same thing in java tho
 EX53: so idk what the problem is
 Maliamnon: EX53 - are you writing a ton to the console?
 EX53: no
 Bobbadillio: It might not be advisable, but I tend to write to console a lot when I get stuck to make sure I'm not going crazy, and my loops aren't spinning infinitely and stuff like that
 EX53: ok ill try that 
 EX53: i mean its the loop that they give you
 EX53: but ill try anyway
 ImagineLosing: why does my game for fall challenge only have 19 rounds and not 100?
 ImagineLosing: when i play my code
 EX53: becuase the game ends on certain perameters as well
 EX53: like its maximum 100 rounds
 VizGhar: 19 is too soon, you probably timed out, or provided incorrect output
 EX53: but in the first division it ends when a witch makes 2 potions 
 ImagineLosing: im in wood 1 league
 VizGhar: well you need 3 potions there i believe?
 ImagineLosing: yes
 EX53: ya then its when someone makes 3 potions
 EX53: ya then the game ends
 EX53: thats why
 ImagineLosing: k thx
 Xenoid: Zenoscave, noooo, you passed me
 Xenoid: I am never gonna get a t-shirt
 Zenoscave: Isn't t-shirts top 20?
 Xenoid: yeah
 Zenoscave: We're both in contention
 Xenoid: I'm out of ideas for my bot though
 Xenoid: unless I change the approach
 Xenoid: I won't make top 20 overall
 Zenoscave: I've got a few major ones left
 Xenoid: nice
 Zenoscave: Hopefully at least one pans out
 Xenoid: yeah, would be cool
 Xenoid: seems to get harder and harder to find optimizations further up the list though, haha
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII Burps</b></p><p><img src="/a/16732569385856" /> Zenoscave: I haven't optimized yet
 Zenoscave: That's one of the ideas
 Xenoid: cool, seems like you are in good shape. Hopefully that will bump you a few more slots at least
 Zenoscave: hopefully
 totorroto: when you get promoted?
 totorroto: or how?
 Zenoscave: When you have a higher rank than the boss. If you're in bronze then the boss isn't chosen until tuesday
 totorroto: i'm higher than the boss and i didnt get promoted
 Zenoscave: Is the submission finished?
 totorroto: maybe i have to wait a little bit or how it works
 totorroto: aaa okey i have to let the battle finish, thanks
 Zenoscave: yup
 totorroto: thanks bro
 totorroto: and how i sent the game parameters to my IDE
 totorroto: how thats worrks
 useAllTheThings: My strategy is to just sit here and wait for everyone else to submit worse code than they had already 
 useAllTheThings: So far it's working not too bad
 Jayantpro: in coders strike back... Can anyone help me a bit in bronze league?
 eulerscheZahl: wow, zeno at #3 :o
 Zenoscave: It's dumb luck tbh
 ImagineLosing: what does this warning mean?:Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 meh1001: you have an extra print somewhere, probably at the end
 Zenoscave: you probably timeout
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ what zeno said
 ImagineLosing: oh k
 Zenoscave: the error message is misleading. usually caused by not printing soon enough
 Zenoscave: It's nearly midnight here. Night all
 useAllTheThings: night
 eulerscheZahl: was it luck yesterday or did i break it?&#160;:(
 abmyii: Is it considered cheating to use a StackOverflow answer in a Code Clash, and if so, how do you flag it?
 abmyii: And to what extent is searching and copying code allowed?
 aCat: morning&#160;;]
 Atomic_coder: its afternoon for me
 aCat: ouch ;p
 aCat: so it will be more suited for you for the contest end ;p
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ieee-cog.org/2020/program">https://ieee-cog.org/2020/program</a>
 aCat: sorry wrong chat
 DerthekNagra: Has some1 considered MCTS for simulating in the fall challenge?
 DerthekNagra: or will it be too expensive to find a "winner"
 eulerscheZahl: while you can do MCTS to optimize for yourself, it mostly shines in 1vs1 and when there is no obvious eval function
 eulerscheZahl: so i don't think MCTS will be a good fit here
 DerthekNagra: Im very new to simulating so Im finding difficult to start
 aCat: euler - a question
 aCat: can you do BFS without state copying?
 aCat: I mean if you have only apply / reverse action
 yhyoxx: please speak english
 eulerscheZahl: not in a reasonable way
 aCat:&#160;:/
 aCat: that i was afraid of
 aCat: damn
 eulerscheZahl: i spam new objects&#160;:/
 aCat: i got engines suited for reversing
 yhyoxx: does the enemy bot change everytime i play my code or only when i submit&#160;?
 aCat: I can switch to have a state as a single int array
 Csipcsirip: how many state.apply(action) u have euler in a round&#160;?
 aCat: but damn
 eulerscheZahl: Csipcsirip i print that
 eulerscheZahl: 20k at best&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: check what rafbill writes
 aCat: but you exclude some less promising actions or check for permutations?
 eulerscheZahl: i hash my states so i know when different sequences give the same outcome
 eulerscheZahl: but sure, pruning is needed if you want to reach a certain depth
 Csipcsirip: ye 20k doenst sound much
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a noob at speed optimizing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 20k holy crap.  I'm under 1k at the moment, *sigh* ... but it's not due to timeout, ha\
 eulerscheZahl: blaster mentioned 150k and room for improvements
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm trying to figure out at what point i should deefault to learn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I so badly don't wanna put learn in the search
 eulerscheZahl: when you need the tier0 tax
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 yhyoxx: hmmmm
 Csipcsirip: I gave up smart learning algo when I saw what psycho is doing
 eulerscheZahl: what is that?
 eulerscheZahl: learn first X?
 Csipcsirip: learn first for 8 rpounds
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: still the first weekend
 aCat: yeah... 
 aCat: and i still don't have engine written down&#160;:(
 Csipcsirip: is it me btw or the submits are rly slow now&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: some learns don't accelerate brews, unless you are doing a prevent strat 
 aCat: you got 3k people in league
 eulerscheZahl: submit is slow...30 matches, all wins. still around rank 50 with 31% done
 eulerscheZahl: i want silver
 aCat: 121 people computing
 Csipcsirip: ye but yesterday it was much faster with like 2.8k ppl. and its still early in hte morning
 eulerscheZahl: and no CSB horror either
 JamesOnnen: why is it slow? 
 eulerscheZahl: maybe CG didn't want to rent that many servers?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: asp.net servers LOL, hehehehahahaha
 eulerscheZahl: AWS or Azure, there are contradicting statements about it
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII pokes JamesOnnen</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps PatrickMcGinnisII around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/12323424608735" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: his profile says MS... gotta poke him

 JamesOnnen: I have been poked
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII gets slapped by automaton</b></p><p><img src="/a/52443661245477" /> ZoltanSimon: Hi everyone
 rmuskovets: hi
 KnightMoves: I would like to fight some battles, please
 yhyoxx: same
 DaNinja: battles are very slow now, it was much faster a couple of hours ago
 eulerscheZahl: we know&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: 172 computing. not even that many
 eulerscheZahl: oh, pb4 is coming
 Cuken: I can't seem to find my friend to use as an agent in the bronze league. Am I missing something?
 eulerscheZahl: you can only add players from top1000
 Cuken: TY
 eulerscheZahl: tell your friend to improve&#160;;)
 FahrendraKhoirul: skuy
 eulerscheZahl: we officially exceeded the player count from the previous contest
 DaNinja: cool
 yhyoxx: nice
 yhyoxx: please try to exceed number of servers
 eulerscheZahl: staff appears offline on discord and i don't want to ping them on sunday. who feels brave enough?
 jrke: let the staff rest for now
 yhyoxx: ill wait 
 eulerscheZahl: did you increase your simcount yet jrke?
 jrke: currently fixing bugs
 spaceorc: Really strange timeouts... I'm printing time taken to stdErr and immediately after that printing command to stdOut. Time is measured from the moment i read the last state line. I see time=43 and TIMEOUT!
 dacr: yes for MCTS but partially at that time, simulation ~500 in 50ms not sure it will give good results...
 DaNinja: might be crashing at the top of the next loop spaceorc
 spaceorc: Nothing about it. If it will be so, the command should return and should be timeout AFTER that
 spaceorc: Console.Error.WriteLine($"time: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds}");Console.WriteLine(cmd);
 spaceorc: there is nothing between this lines
 Donotalo: time for cg server to scale up horizontally
 spaceorc: I will try to measure time from the moment i get the first input line, not the whole input
 Csipcsirip: can some1 explain the enresult of this game&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/502161602">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/502161602</a>
 Loran: gah nothing like intermittent errors to make debugging fun
 eulerscheZahl: you have 1 green Csipcsirip
 eulerscheZahl: Players gain 1 rupee for each tier-1 ingredient or higher in their inventory.
 Csipcsirip: oh, i missed that 
 Q12: Why when I do "test in arena" I start from the end of the league?You can just check if I am better than my last bot and if I am then start from his place and if not start from the bottom. does it make sense?
 spaceorc: It true skill
 wlesavo: Csipcsirip yeah, i think many people missed that, same with spells hiding spells, a lot of confusion
 eulerscheZahl: often the answer is: it would be too much effort to redesign that now
 eulerscheZahl: hiding?
 Csipcsirip: spells hiding spells&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the visuals?
 wlesavo: typo just spells hiding
 wlesavo: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i complained, illedan too. now there's a toggle in the viewer settings
 Loran: If i had to guess Q12 its because the backend treats a new submission as a new player and just deletes the old submission. so the new bot has no ELO to compare with and starts at the bottom.
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't agree with the default setting but much better now
 wlesavo: good thing it can be disabled in settings, but we found out very late about that 
 wlesavo: yeah same
 eulerscheZahl: was added on friday afternoon i think
 eulerscheZahl: seed=5848640168752334800
 wlesavo: btw im stealing your fatality euler
 eulerscheZahl: code:

 eulerscheZahl: frame 12: eulerscheZahl learnt spell 32 and gained 0 taxed ingredients, the rest was lost because their inventory is full.
 eulerscheZahl: uncool wlesavo
 Q12: Loran: I understand what you said but I think it will make the time needed to calc which place are you shorter
 wlesavo: euler you shouldve patent that :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: i should have waited till the last day
 wlesavo: i wonder how that one python guy keeps up at #30
 spaceorc: whyyyyy evvvrythiiinngggg iiissss soooo slloowwww????
 Neumann: You're too many
 yhyoxx: :p
 eulerscheZahl: your keyboard is lagging
 spaceorc: :smile:
 wlesavo: well at least chat is not slow, i guess no coding
 eulerscheZahl: submit is no fun. i wanted to test something. but also see where this one ends
 eulerscheZahl: even for mods the chat seems normal atm
 yhyoxx: Ahh that red arrow
 eulerscheZahl: my current sumbit doesn't even have an arrow indicator anymore
 eulerscheZahl: such a long delay between games
 jrke: me too
 DaNinja: 5% progress in 40 minutes
 yhyoxx:&#160;:/
 Q12: This is why you CG should do this:Why when I do "test in arena" I start from the end of the league?You can just check if I am better than my last bot and if I am then start from his place and if not start from the bottom. does it make sense?
 spaceorc: That moment when you decide not to submit bug fix...
 Zaphus: submitted an update, *then* opened chat - doh!
 Hussain_Alramadan: Hi, it's my first time chatting with you guyes
 eulerscheZahl: not even talking about experimenting
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: Does any one else facing problem of not getting battle in contest or is it with me only?
 eulerscheZahl: read a few messages above WaRiOrOfCoDe&#160;;)
 TrippTrapp84: dude this reverse engineering challenge hurts my brain
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: ohh didn't realise
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: sorry
 jrke: thats we all are chatting WaRiOrOfCoDe
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: man I should not have submitted
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: my rank went down and not going up
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: now
 spaceorc: &gt; Q12It's a standard true skill implementation - your new submission is not compared with your previous submission. It gets default mu and sigma, and CG has skill-based match maker, so you should play with many weak strategies
 jrke: just wait until any CG staff comes online
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yeah
 The_chosen_one: Hello
 The_chosen_one: Stay Safe and stay healthy
 Q12: &gt; spaceorcI know what they are doing, I think it would be faster if they will do what I said
 spaceorc: I believe that will be unfair
 Q12: why?
 jrke: 278 bots are computing at the moment
 spaceorc: Q12&gt; Algorithm have no information about your new submission. What if it completely bad? Why it should have so small sigma? It's strange!
 spaceorc: Q12&gt; If someone wins against your bad submission he will gain unfair rating boost...
 spaceorc: Q12&gt; And finally it goes agains true skill paper :smile:
 spaceorc: Q12&gt; And finally it goes against true skill paper :smile:
 Zaphus: @spaceorc - remember it's your code that is being ranked, not you - and the code is new every time, so it does not go against TrueSkill
 Q12: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa4bd242-f077-4a11-8eda-58e2c1d1842d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa4bd242-f077-4a11-8eda-58e2c1d1842d</a>
 Q12: &gt; spaceorc this :point_up_2: is for you
 Neumann: Do you guys remember in which CG game timeouts could only be detected if "invalid" was written in the tooltip/frame info&#160;?
 Neumann: There are false positive timeout detections in the FallChallenge and I'd like to know which other game I'll break if I remove the "invalid" check :P
 spaceorc: &gt; Zaphus that’s what Q12 is talking about, not me
 Zaphus: ah, got confused sorry
 Uljahn: Q12: "If my new bot is better which means he is surly above the place of my last bot" - that's not true, being better than your previous bot doesn't mean the new version would rank higher, just think about RPS situation
 Donotalo: will cg give us today's time back for slow server? my last submission is stuck at 24% after more than 90 minutes.
 Donotalo: i'm waiting to understand if the modification works
 Csipcsirip: u will get your money back don't worry
 spaceorc: ha ha ha ha lol :slight_smile:
 Donotalo: :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud reacted with :eyes: so it seems they are already investigating
 eulerscheZahl: i'd like to believe that it just couldn't handle my strong new submit
 MarekM: looks like 100KB source is a limit, bye bye precomputed data&#160;:)
 spaceorc: @eulerscheZahl - For 6th position after just 24% it should be really strong
 struct: 100k chars is the limit 
 struct: characters
 struct: Doesnt matter if the character is 1 byte or 4
 xineohp: Anybody facing any issues while publishing the bot?
 spaceorc: There is only one issue now - games are playing 1 in an hour
 Grudo: It doesn't work at all :D 10min 0%
 struct: 367 players during submit
 struct: CSB memories
 spaceorc: from discord: Magus: database screaming for help
 Magus: I'm just a moderator, I don't have more informations than you :D
 Magus: So i'm just trying to guess
 demo_demo_demo: I'm stock at the bottom of the leaderboard and battles progress stock in 0 for like 20 min
 xineohp: same with me
 Grudo: demo_demo_demo I'm next toy you&#160;;)
 Grudo: we just have to wait
 spaceorc: sale! good places in a queue! only here, only today! beware of fakes!
 shainy_oreng: suddenly pineapples
 shainy_oreng:&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: so Magus when will you deploy a fix?
 eulerscheZahl: the slowdown made me set up a local testing environment&#160;:/
 Remus_: So many people started testing and never came back up I advanced 100 places xD
 Nerchio: automaton2020 when will the leaderboard be fixed
 Nerchio: he's gone
 struct: I also dont understand why the leaederboard is reversed
 eulerscheZahl: automaton2020 never talked
 eulerscheZahl: only NN and 2000
 Illedan: Good morning, did you kill the servers :O
 eulerscheZahl: it was getting slower and slower during the morning

 Illedan: hm?
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: ah your local thing
 eulerscheZahl: my new, unsubmitted bot wins 75% vs arena
 Illedan: Nice
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: I'll set up something once I start to sim too
 adouz: can someone tell why my score is 0.00? i just submitted to the arena and the progress is still in 0%
 Nerchio: leaderboards are stuck atm
 Illedan: Servers are having lunch, give them a little break
 struct: Almost 5k
 Illedan: 415 computing
 adouz: ok thanks, i will wait
 DaNinja: I blame those garbage collectors
 heisenbug: it seems there is a problem in the area, the battles come out very slowly...
 eulerscheZahl: staff is already investigating
 struct: yeah, CG is currently fixing it
 heisenbug: ok thanks
 MadKnight: rip the servers
 MadKnight: what is gonna be happening on the last day&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: a contest
 MadKnight: with the servers
 MadKnight: are they gonna be dying even worse&#160;?
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Submits should be fixed
 eulerscheZahl: yay!
 eulerscheZahl: any funny story to tell?
 spaceorc: oh yes!
 yonder83: what search algorhitmh you use
 wlesavo: wow nice work, thx!
 DaNinja: :clap:
 ELmahdi1962: guys i dont understand the lumen puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that's what you wanted to write on the forum. but the spam filter ate it
 ELmahdi1962: not spam filter
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 ELmahdi1962: just need to be reviewed because  im new
 ELmahdi1962: its way my fist action in the forum ever
 jacek: oO
 ELmahdi1962: anyway can some one explain to me that lumen puzzle
 ELmahdi1962: how n=5 and c=3 and the output is 9
 eulerscheZahl: that's a vague question. what did you understand and where did your understanding stop?
 ELmahdi1962: i dont know how this 9 came out
 eulerscheZahl: the n=5, c=3 has to be seen with the map
 ELmahdi1962: ok 1 sec
 eulerscheZahl: the C is a source of light
 eulerscheZahl: and you take the distance from each cell to that C. if it's &gt; 3, it's shadow
 eulerscheZahl: count the shadow cells
 ELmahdi1962: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed663f66-1d04-4799-afc4-62014e4b41e8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed663f66-1d04-4799-afc4-62014e4b41e8</a>
 ELmahdi1962: aaa so c is the distance of light right?
 eulerscheZahl: the distance map is also in the statement
 Donotalo: how much RAM do we get from cg?
 eulerscheZahl: 768MB
 yonder83: Can both players brew same recipe?
 ParticleBeam: yes
 ParticleBeam: If at the same round
 yonder83: do you know? in fall challenge
 yonder83: ok, thank you
 yonder83: I learnt that they can learn same spell
 yonder83: and can brew same recipe too, thanks

 eulerscheZahl: only numpy and scipy
 eulerscheZahl: and pandas
 kovi: wow, everyone is potiondept2+ now?
 kovi: in top20 i mean, as my experience is that i struggle in top100 with brewdepth1
 Nerchio: i have bfs depth 4 thats all top25 atm x
 Nerchio: cant do much more with java :joy:
 Barimehdi77: how many spalls they are? cuz Iknow they are 5 potions
 LordSkaven: So graph transversal is the way to go for the fall challenge? I have been approaching it that way, thought I was overthinking it
 Nerchio: that's more like underthinking it :D
 kovi: depth4: you mean you getting 4 brews along?
 kovi: or just a full search for 4 actions
 LordSkaven: awesome, thought I was missing something obvious. First time taking part in something like this, really enjoying it
 Nerchio: no kovi ofc not 4 brews ;P
 Nerchio: its just 1 brew
 Nerchio: i guess my small amount of heuristics did a nice job
 Nerchio: but looks like sooner or later the top should be most about computation
 kovi: unfortunately
 Nerchio: I agree pure computation is not my thing
 Barimehdi77: we have 4 spells right?
 Barimehdi77: and 5 potions in every turn
 Uljahn: initially yes
 Barimehdi77: in the wood 1 league
 Uljahn: ah
 jacek: wood1? thats so last week
 Doju: what on earth
 Doju: why does "        instance = cls.__new__(cls, *self[:])"
 Doju: return an empty list but instance = Delta(*self[:]) works
 Doju: Delta inherits list
 Grudo: how many players get to silver at opening?
 Uljahn: as many as above the boss
 Quidome: I thought last time it was 50
 Grudo: ah so we just have to wait to see how strong boss will be
 Quidome: not sure and the can change that number
 Quidome: The last one entering silver on opening will be the boss
 Rprades: has anyone tried genetic alg for this? it tried but wast too slow  to converge (around 100ms)
 garfieldhasbacon: garfield is so coooool
 garfieldhasbacon: do any of u guys like garfield
 jacek: scarfield?
 garfieldhasbacon: GARFIELD
 jacek: i hate mondays :v
 garfieldhasbacon: he is cat. and loves loves loves lasagna
 Uljahn: i like kickfield
 alexthe2: hey guys I'm doing this for the first time. How do I get out of wood2 into wood1?
 Nerchio: zenoscave top3 really nice
 garfieldhasbacon: stuffing your face as usual
 the...G: how do I move up the leader board? is it just winning or is it the number of points?
 garfieldhasbacon: i dont know a single thing about coding i am just having my fiance in waiting do all the work for me. she is very good at using the numpad
 garfieldhasbacon: she once wrote a whole ternary expression using alt code on teh numpad i dont know how she does it but she types every letter with one finge ron the alt and the other all over the numpad. its crazy hojw she does it
 DaNinja: numpad to legend!
 Uljahn: alexthe2: you can watch some streams
 garfieldhasbacon: my mom ate all the cheeze its taht i were going to eat to get thru these dumb coding problems
 Uljahn: the..G: winning gives you points according to TrueSkill algo
 alexthe2: I'm currently in the arena, but I am stuck at pos number 3
 alexthe2: The other 2 above me use the same code
 the...G: Thanks ULjahn
 alexthe2: The same algo idea
 the...G: how do I see other players code?
 alexthe2: I don' see it, but from their playstyle it's doing the same things
 alexthe2: ohhh, wait does all the battles have to be finished
 alexthe2: so I get promoted?
 the...G: My code is really simple, just going for the highest value brew.
 garfieldhasbacon: coding is so dumb, i cant type 200 wpm for the life of me
 Uljahn: alexthe2 yes
 alexthe2: ok thanks
 garfieldhasbacon: how do u type faster
 alexthe2: u don't look at your keyboard
 alexthe2: and you don't fdo typos
 garfieldhasbacon: omg!!
 Remus_: write a bot to type for you, duh
 alexthe2: like that one
 the...G: learn to use all of  your fingers.
 alexthe2: Nah
 the...G: just 2 fingers then .
 alexthe2: Develop your won style and then check it out
 alexthe2: If it is good and fast you wil be fin e
 garfieldhasbacon: thank u i think i can type really fast now after all that good advice u guys just gave me
 titano: Hello, can sbdy tell me how I can test de computing time (and so exit a long calculation to give my answer on time)&#160;?I am coding in JS
 the...G: pleased to be of assistance
 NightScap3: :joy:

 Doju: hey guys, why does my cls.__new__(cls, a, b, c, d) return [] but Delta(a, b, c, d) returns [a, b, c, d]
 Doju: cls is &lt;class 'main.Delta'&gt;
 ELmahdi1962: omg that lumen puzzle is so hard 
 Grudo: how to display text on screen?
 ELmahdi1962: all what i did till now is get cords of C
 ELmahdi1962: i need help
 rmuskovets: Grudo: what language?
 Grudo: C++
 Doju: Grudo you add the text after your command
 rmuskovets: Grudo cerr for debug output, if you're doing Fall Challenge - just put your message after the command like "REST my message"
 garfieldhasbacon: this site is dum it tells me i jus need to put a local on my local to fi my errors
 Grudo: oh it works&#160;:) thanks
 garfieldhasbacon: like, really??
 cegprakash: Zenoscave #3 :o
 Doju: right, sure thing, python
 Doju: AssertionError: [1, 2, 3, 4]&#160;!= [1, 2, 3, 4]
 eulerscheZahl: different objects
 Illedan: euler, is the submitted thing your "monster"?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: stable top10 at least
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 ParticleBeam: Why did I use long variable names...
 eulerscheZahl: what a C++ wall already
 MahirSez: hello, i has a query. What happens if i cast a spell and there is not enough space in my inventorywill that casting be discarded?
 Illedan: zeno is doing nice though
 MahirSez: *had
 Illedan: :O
 ParticleBeam: No. It will fail
 Illedan: Hmm, did emil break his IDE code on purpose?&#160;:(
 Barimehdi77: I write this function to store the brews in a var named brews and spells in var named spells
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6bae3eac-398f-4862-9bf7-ccb570c3dc2f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6bae3eac-398f-4862-9bf7-ccb570c3dc2f</a>
 eulerscheZahl: unknown. but we know that it's broken
 Barimehdi77: but the output is not expected

 Illedan: Gotta be on purpose
 Illedan: -.-
 Nerchio: so do you guys think that legend in this game will be pure calculation?
 Illedan: yes
 eulerscheZahl: yes++
 Nerchio: ok wanted to make sure when to stop coding
 Nerchio: now sounds like a good time :D
 rmuskovets: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3344265-6cd7-477f-9b88-261d7bbe01f6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3344265-6cd7-477f-9b88-261d7bbe01f6</a>
 rmuskovets: Barimehdi77: ^
 Nerchio: at the start you need to take spells and feeding your opponent is bad so taking 'free' spells is most optimal most of the time
 Nerchio: and if both players take the same spells nothing else matters except calculation
 eulerscheZahl: and if your sim is deep enough you can compute best spells :P
 geppoz: "pure calculation" you means going as deep as possible without score evaluation?
 eulerscheZahl: scoring will still be necessary and important
 alexthe2: you could backtrack if you have the nuts to write that code
 Illedan: backtrack from what?
 eulerscheZahl: but scoring alone without thousands of simulation steps won't get you anywhere
 alexthe2: simulate
 alexthe2: and then get best result
 alexthe2: by backtracking
 rmuskovets: should a sim do also enemy's steps or yours is enough?
 Illedan: Up to you to figure out&#160;;)
 alexthe2: I guess you can just simulate only yours
 eulerscheZahl: i think yourself is the most important here, little interaction
 Remus_: alexthe2I'm trying to do that but my code is boggy&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: some opponent prediction won't harm
 rmuskovets: this is the first time im writing a sim
 alexthe2: Yeah makes sense, I just learned about codingame and I will use some gentic shit later on
 rmuskovets: so i think opponent prediction will just slow me down
 alexthe2: given that I can save gentic models
 alexthe2: can I&#160;?
 rmuskovets: i think yes
 rmuskovets: serialization/deserialization
 rmuskovets: using whatever library
 Barimehdi77: rmuskovets Thank you
 alexthe2: Yeah I know, I just don't know whether oyu can do it on here
 rmuskovets: cg workers are just vms with the compiler preinstaller, why not?
 rmuskovets: preinstalled*
 Nerchio: if i write the same code from Java in C++ is it going to be much faster
 eulerscheZahl: factor 2-3
 Nerchio: or the idea is to use other structures that make C++ fast
 Mr_Andersson: The 1 second limit for turn 1, does that include VM startup and JIT for languages like C# and java, or does it only count my actual code?
 JBM: as far as i know the referee stays external to all that
 JBM: so a bit more than your actual code
 Mr_Andersson: hmm ok, so picking a language that compiles to native instructions is more "effective" than a JIT language?
 Nerchio: yes
 Nerchio: much more effective
 Nerchio: sadly&#160;;(
 eulerscheZahl: the 1s was initially introduced as some languages have a slow startup
 Mr_Andersson: I see, thanks.
 struct: Anyone knows what MSmits used on  othello?
 struct: I wasn't here when he reached 1st&#160;:/
 Nerchio: somebody had a nice C++ bundler here anyone knows?
 struct: 5k players 
 struct: I use this one Nerchio <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MarcosCosmos/cg-cpp-bundler">https://github.com/MarcosCosmos/cg-cpp-bundler</a>
 Nerchio: thanks
 FrancoisB: As far as I know JIT execution *can* be faster that AOT compiled code since optimization can be made for the target machine
 eulerscheZahl: in c++ we can use pragmas to optimize for a specific architecture
 FrancoisB: There is no denying the supremacy of C++, especially considering memory, just wanted to highlight that JIT doesn't always mean terrible performance
 Mr_Andersson: I would assume the CG compilers are tuned to optimize for whatever hardware they are running on. But yeah, for a generic "needs to run on all x86" binary JIT can be faster if you exclude the startup/compilation time.
 kreo: I would add that C++ is not the only language that you can consider in resource-constrained scenarios. There's also Rust at least
 jacek: struct he specifically used opening books against the top
 biskop: so performance becomes very relevant in higher leauges?
 geppoz: uhm i have a lot of timeouts in battles, when i send the match in IDE, then it doesn't timeout... wtf?
 jacek: rust?
 struct: thanks jacek
 geppoz: python
 kreo: Do you have any randomness in your code?
 geppoz: no
 geppoz: except for time measure
 geppoz: i exit at 900ms at first and at 40ms in next turns
 geppoz: it seems crashing in first turn in battles
 geppoz: and not in ide
 jacek: 1st player vs 2nd player?
 jacek: do you test in ide being 2nd player?
 Vintarel: same for me geppoz, it timeouts many more times in battles than in IDE&#160;:(
 geppoz: it seems it is not that the problem, it crashes in both cases in battles and neither in ide
 geppoz: Vintarel, but always in first or second turn
 geppoz: never when the game is past 3rd turn
 Vintarel: ok not for me, it's random between third and 13th turn
 geppoz: and that never happened yesterday
 DeWitt: tops, do you optimize tax payments so that you are not copying them into every state?
 DeWitt: optimze = not include additional stones
 Vintarel: i guess machines for IDE and battles are not the same, thus the differences, but i might be wrong...
 Vintarel: i'm exploring this now
 eulerscheZahl: are we talking about data storage or bot behavior DeWitt?
 struct: how, I clear vector and it doesnt clear
 struct: what is this sorcery
 DeWitt: i think, both. if we assume that there is never "extra" stones in the   learnable cast
 jacek: thats withcrat
 DeWitt: we can save some memory
 RockyMullet: but tax will change during the sim
 DeWitt: but this will make the behaviour pessimistic
 DeWitt: memory = number of sims per tick
 eulerscheZahl: i have a static list for the tome. and a bitmaks to know which one are still available
 Mr_Andersson: Is there a memory constraint in the higher leagues?
 RockyMullet: well one thing you wont be able to do, is learn a spell to get the tier0 insteda of casting a tier0 only spell
 eulerscheZahl: 768MB
 Mr_Andersson: I see.
 struct: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; ++i) {
 DeWitt: yeah, but do you include number of exta stones that are added when you learn a spell?
 struct: oh god
 struct: send help
 codingPassio: is there any one good at js?
 eulerscheZahl: struct :D
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl any problem with memory&#160;? I dont think theres a lot to copy
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely struggle with memory
 DeWitt: taxCount changes over time
 RockyMullet: good good
 eulerscheZahl: just to make it faster than copying lists
 RockyMullet: I was planning on not giving any f about it lol
 codingPassio: wich programming language good for back-end developer?
 RockyMullet: back-end of what&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and how many sims do you get in 40ms RockyMullet?
 codingPassio: web back-end
 RockyMullet: well im on the planning phase of my depth N, thats why im asking questions haha, I'm still on my depth 2, so didnt bother to count yet
 DeWitt: o
 DeWitt: i have something like 600, but i feel like its too little
 DeWitt: how many do you have eulerscheZahl?
 Xanrum: 600 depth?
 DeWitt: 600 sims
 eulerscheZahl: 10k-20k
 DeWitt: bam
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm on the low end among the top ranks
 RockyMullet: I feel it's better to make slowly and right, than trying to rush on the first weekend, also my motivation is not on it's highest on this contest
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/502232551">https://www.codingame.com/replay/502232551</a>10x my sim count
 Xanrum: 100-120k on up to depth 10
 DeWitt: qq: how do you print&#160;? 
 DeWitt: but are you trying all the actions in each of your sims?
 DeWitt: or it<i>s  actually mcts? </i>
 RockyMullet: some actions can be ignored
 RockyMullet: reducing the branching
 Xanrum: every available - enougth ingredients, for rest - have any spell on cooldown
 RockyMullet: yeah no point of testing to rest twice in a row
 eulerscheZahl: why are some many chat users obsessed with MCTS? there are more algos that add some pruning
 DeWitt: idk, just saw somedy writing about it yesterday in the chat :D 
 eulerscheZahl: and i was like WTF :D
 Csipcsirip: MCTS is fun
 DeWitt: i feel like the problem is that we need to have some  decent evaluation function if you do tree search
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't see the benefits for this specific game
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl you doing a bfs I'd guess&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Csipcsirip: ye me neither
 DeWitt: haha
 Quidome: If you cast a spell and  there is not enough room in your inventory will that work?
 RockyMullet: oh well I will, since I'm just a simple man lol
 DomiKo: MCTS is like the legendary hard algo, I guess
 Vintarel: no
 Vintarel: just try casting spell 1 many times.. it does not work
 Xanrum: no, you must check it
 RockyMullet: Quidome no, only tax on learned spell can "bust"
 Quidome: ok, thnxs
 struct: I dont feel like mcts is legendary hard
 Uljahn: you mean vanilla mcts
 DomiKo: based on information I have, yes it is
 DomiKo: A lot of students are scared of it
 alexthe2: it is not hard just complicated af
 struct: Im more scared of pathfinding algos
 Gabbek: heya RockyMullet
 YassineMouadden: share code
 YassineMouadden: may alah forgive your sins
 Gabbek: I see you guys are doing some nice work, while I've been slacking hard :D
 eulerscheZahl: shame
 Gabbek: dunno, just no motivation for this one for some reason, started improving my LoCM instead :p
 RockyMullet: hey Gabbek
 RockyMullet: I'm on the slacking team
 ELmahdi1962: guys im stuck in lumen puzzle XD
 ELmahdi1962: i  need help
 RockyMullet: philosophying about algos instead of coding
 Csipcsirip: subit is getting slower and slower again
 Donotalo: then it's time for a break again&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i reported it last time, now it's your turn
 jacek: i thought is was simultanous
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: I don't know if I can ask this here but still is someone using neural networks or other things like that?
 kreo: I don't think so, 50ms looks like too little time for a decent net
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: It is comforting, I should try harder to sharp up my logic
 RockyMullet: hu, im now 3rd in canada, that's what slacking got me
 struct: Top 4 in CSB are NNs
 Gabbek: I would like to ask for some c++ learning guidance
 Gabbek: does anyone know a good place to start? I know basics, but I would like to improve my knowledge
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: Looks like I should look into learning neural networks then
 jacek: perhaps as multi some people will experiment with NN
 jacek: but 2 weeks is not enough to design and learn NN for such game
 struct: Yeah I agree with jacek
 struct: Most people who tried to implement NN during contest had very poor results
 alexthe2: You can go for genetics
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: okay so I will focus on logic.
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: Any sources to learn?

 starmaq: @Gabbek if you wanna really devote your time for it, read one of the many books that exist on it, I'd recommend one of bjarne's books or scott meyers' 
 Gabbek: starmaq thank you very much, writing that down&#160;:)
 starmaq: I got my C++ knowledge just from googling and searching, so maybe that would suit you better too
 starmaq: stack overflow is your friend 
 struct: I think sim is working
 struct: At least random is
 RockyMullet: struct :raised_hands:
 RockyMullet: gj
 struct: thanks
 Maliamnon: How long is evaluation taking this fine morning?
 spaceorc: is everything stuck again
 spaceorc:&#160;?
 LordSkaven: when I do arena, it stays at 18% battles in progress, is that normal?
 Victorien_aka_TL: It's very slow today, too many battles to process. I hope it will be better tomorrow when they open the new leagues
 spaceorc: it would be hard to pass to the new league with this games rate
 TerrificTaurus: @Gabbek you can google for "Thinking in C++", it's an old book, but very good for the basics of the language and STL, you can build on thatI'd definitely recommend the Effective C++ books from Meyers probably the best books on C++I found Stroustup's books harder to start with, I think they are not for beginners
 LordSkaven: I am currently in wood 1, how do I go to bronze?
 alexthe2: ANSI C 2nd edition is very nice for C, if you want to start with that one
 Victorien_aka_TL: LordSkaven&#160;: beat the boss and then test your code in the arena
 LordSkaven: ah ok cool, in arena now.
 Victorien_aka_TL: If you're good enough they will pass you to the superior league after some combats
 alexthe2: @LordSkaven it takes a long time
 Gabbek: TerrificTaurus thank you very much for so detailed answer!
 alexthe2: @Victorien I started 1800 now advanced to 57 but I am still stuck
 alexthe2: There is no next battle
 kuhnchris: Yeah my next battles are stuck too.
 alexthe2: What happens if two people fight each other that doesn't do anything?
 alexthe2: does it really animate up to 100 turns?
 kuhnchris: They get disqualified if there is no input AFAIK
 kuhnchris: except you mean like... 100 turns of rest.
 alexthe2: My oponnent for example is doing nothing
 Mr_Andersson: Would be a draw I guess, both players count as winners.
 alexthe2: But he is brewing and casting impossible spells
 LordSkaven: well time to play some games while I wait for the arena run to finish
 alexthe2: I hope this will go on faster, battles are on 20% since 20mins
 TerrificTaurus: @Gabbek, you're welcomeTiCPP is a free book, you can find many copies online, e.g.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://web.mit.edu/merolish/ticpp/Frames-expanded-TOC.html">http://web.mit.edu/merolish/ticpp/Frames-expanded-TOC.html</a>
 TerrificTaurus: @Gabbek this is pre-C++11 but still valid
 Gabbek: great stuff! If you would ever need any python help - poke me!&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Hm, not convinced the Eckel book is still worthwhile, I remember it being iffy even back then. Stroustrup has a complete C++ book and another one which is learning *programming* using C++, then you could read Meyers, not sure of others
 starmaq: C++ books are most of the time gigantic, but I don't mind having one laying around if I ever want to check something 
 starmaq: I don't see myself reading one 
 starmaq: the standard has 1500 pages I think xd
 pmor: C++ Primer was one of the best a long time ago
 alexthe2: Jesus, will this arena move any further?
 Astrobytes: I think the staff are looking into it
 alexthe2: oh ok
 Astrobytes: It can be slow during contests anyway but seems it's extra slow atm
 alexthe2: it's stuck for more than 40mins
 Mr_Andersson: My progress&#160;% hasn't changed for 2 hours, but my rank keeps changing so something must be running at least.
 alexthe2: that are just ppl leaving
 kuhnchris: i got some network error: -1, so something's fishy
 Astrobytes: Melting servers
 Uljahn: CSB promotions number isn't very high, just 76 of them :smirk:
 Doju: finally got the sim working
 Doju: thought it's pretty bad since it only goes to depth 2
 Doju: maybe i should prune some of the learn actions
 struct: 76 in CSB really?
 struct: 435 on fall + 78 on CSB
 Astrobytes: lol
 MoonPhoenix: Can I adjust the bot later for the later leagues?
 kuhnchris: yes
 MoonPhoenix: Or do I need to do it now?
 kuhnchris: each new league sends your bot back into the editor with the state you programmed it in the last league
 MoonPhoenix: oh cool
 kuhnchris: (+ the new requirements to implement)
 MoonPhoenix: how do I enter it to the league as I finished it for now?
 TerrificTaurus: at the beginning I found The C++ Programming Language from Stroustrup to be daunting, then switched to the Eckel book, and found it very beginner friendlyStroustrup's books are a much easier read once you know some of the language
 MoonPhoenix: Test in Arena?
 kuhnchris: "Test in Arena" and wait
 MoonPhoenix: Do I need to keep the browser open or something? Or can I just leave it
 kuhnchris: if you are above the Boss&lt;name&gt; player you'll get auto-promoted every couple of... I guess hours or so?
 kuhnchris: not sure i'd keep it open in the background
 Mr_Andersson: When you get to 100% progress, which at this rate is a couple of days at least&#160;:(
 MoonPhoenix: Alright, thanks a lot
 TerrificTaurus: can anyone recommend a good resource about modern c++?
 Astrobytes: TerrificTaurus: Stroustrup-wise I certainly wouldn't start with The C++ Programming Language! But Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ is much gentler
 Astrobytes: That's probably as 'modern' as it gets, the language moves so fast these days you have to do keep up with it yourself
 Astrobytes: *have to keep up
 alexthe2: ahhhhhhh, any infos?
 alexthe2: cause bug-report got no answer
 alexthe2: last we're looking into it was at 11:32, but it was working in the meantime
 andrefpoliveira: In C# is heavier for a class to have 4 int vars or a list with 4 elements?
 alexthe2: omg we got 21%
 alexthe2: pace of 1% per hour
 starmaq: at the end of the day that's just gonna take 16 bytes, but access-wise a list may be way better due to memory locality
 kuhnchris: 18%&#160;:(
 ParticleBeam: Odd. CG IDE not formatting or refactoring
 starmaq: if you're really looking for performance do that, but in the long run it's gonna be annoying so sticking to variables is better for readability and in the long run maintainability
 starmaq: I think it's an idiom in C++ to use a table to pack up a bunch of variables in an array then using initialization list syntax you can do a simple Class()&#160;: array{var1, var2, var3} {}
 starmaq: which looks cool
 azerty123456: bonjour, j'ai envoyé mon code dans l'arène il y a 40 minutes, depuis je ne peux rien faire d'autre. Il faut attendre la fin de tous les combats&#160;? Je suis nouveau sur codingame je ne connais pas encore bien le fonctionnement.
 struct: #fr
 TerrificTaurus: @Astrobytes thanks, I haven't checked out the latest editions of his books yetI agree, features are coming so fast these days, but I'm looking for basic things like move semantics and rvalue references
 azerty123456: thanks struct&#160;;)
 alexthe2: mon francais n'est pas bien.Il y a des problemes mais le personnel se penche dessus
 alexthe2: Jesus I don't wanna speak french anymore
 alexthe2: but hopefully this helps
 RockyMullet: lol
 RockyMullet: your sentence make it sound like your french is sick and needs a doctor or something lol
 RockyMullet: good attempt tho :P
 azerty123456: thank you alexthe2 I understand&#160;;)
 struct: Still better than my french
 RockyMullet: let's not start talking about my english
 struct: I can read it but cant type at all
 Maliamnon: 12% submitted after an hour&#160;:(
 alexthe2: @Rocky I think I had it in highschool for 4 years. But that was 3 years ago
 alexthe2: jesus I had it for 5 years
 diogo.giassi: Servers melting, 14% more than 1 hour ...
 RockyMullet: my sister in law is german and she speaks ridiculous good french for a non native speaker
 alexthe2: I am german
 alexthe2: but I study in the netherlands
 Maliamnon: well, on the bright side, having a 100% winrate after an hour is pretty cool&#160;;)
 alexthe2: ^
 RockyMullet: meanwhile I must know like 2 words in german
 alexthe2: especiall if your opponents are just doing WAIT
 RockyMullet: ooooh thats why im climbing randomly in ranks, people submit and takes too long to rank up lol
 RockyMullet: hopefully opening silver will help
 Ra777: when silver starts?
 RockyMullet: tommorow
 DomiKo: openning silver won't help that much
 Ra777: is there calendar or something?
 DomiKo: yes
 RockyMullet: usually around 5-6 pm french time
 Astrobytes: TerrificTaurus: I have the 2nd edition and it covers all the basics, doesn't go too deep on a few features but there's other books and references for going further
 Ra777: thanks
 alexthe2: I actually wanted to go for google kickstart today but then I missed it cause I had the wrong time. Then friends of mine were like: try codingame...And while I actaully enjoyed writing really bad code and passing through wood2 and now giving the logic some stupid params to pass in wood1 this happended
 alexthe2: Ahhhhhhhh
 RockyMullet: DomiKo yeah, silver will have a lot of people too
 RockyMullet: alexthe2 what happened&#160;?
 alexthe2: Servers are stuck
 Nerchio: leaderboard lag probably
 RockyMullet: oh yeah right
 alexthe2: on 21%
 Nerchio: maybe you broke the  servers alex
 Nerchio: with your code
 spaceorc: for me on 11%...
 alexthe2: Nerchio it's so bad that it might have happened lmao
 alexthe2: Like whoever reads the code is just gonna cry in tears
 DomiKo: a lot of people are submiting right now
 alexthe2: *drawn in tears
 alexthe2: I wanted to do some genetics later on, but first I have to get to later
 RockyMullet: end of the weekend, people are trying to push what they done during the weekend
 RockyMullet: and with 3k people in bronze, that's a lot of people
 Counterbalance: yawn
 spaceorc: Already more than 1 hour without any game on 11% - it's not about something is simply slow, something does not work at all.
 malcoriel: same here, stuck on 0%
 Astrobytes: Staff are currently looking into it, be patient (it's annoying, I know)
 spaceorc: we believe, we hope, we are waiting! :slight_smile:
 xineohp: Published new changes now, hoping this time it completes faster.
 Counterbalance: yay! some battles are coming through
 alexthe2: not for me
 Counterbalance: it was at 0% for 11 minutes, then the first 10 battles appeared
 alexthe2: I really wanted to do some genetics in higher leagues. But first I have to come there
 xineohp: Any idea when higher leagues open?
 alexthe2: tomorow
 Astrobytes: Click the Bronze league icon up top
 xineohp: oh, thanks
 alexthe2: The moment somethin on you screen changes, and you just realized it was one of your old battles
 totorroto: for someone else the arena battles takes so long?
 alexthe2: y, DB are at 100%
 DominikSipowicz: I have 0% battles in progress 
 totorroto: okey thxs
 PotterRafed: Dom :D
 jacek: aww
 CommanderCero: im gaining ranks while not doing any battles, so atleast im winning by doing nothing
 Waffle3z: same, went from 87 to 68 overnight
 eulerscheZahl: that will be a fun league opening with 1k players promoting at once
 DominikSipowicz: I dropped because I updated&#160;:\ I can revert my code so you can drop
 DominikSipowicz: kidding :D
 CommanderCero: would that even work, im stuck at 11%
 MasterDuck: me too
 totorroto: what's deliverySpell means in the github repository? can someone xplain me
 eulerscheZahl: BREW?
 totorroto: yeah ahha my bad
 eulerscheZahl: yes, DeliverySpell is just a BREW
 eulerscheZahl: (just checked it)
 spaceorc: And they are described inverted in code.
 zahariaca: is there a specific hour when the league opens?
 Michael_Howard: Hope the servers don't do this again next Sunday.
 eulerscheZahl: around 6pm CET
 eulerscheZahl: that is in 25.5h from now
 reCurse: Dammit too slow
 zahariaca: thank you!
 RockyMullet: there's a maximum possible tax I'd guess&#160;?
 reCurse: No
 RockyMullet: hu it can go really high
 reCurse: But it will be mostly discarded at some point
 Michael_Howard: Essentially 10
 eulerscheZahl: 2* (total spell count-1)
 reCurse: You can safely cap it at 10
 geppoz: you can consider max =10
 RockyMullet: yeah I can assume it's 10
 eulerscheZahl: 10 is a good estimate, yeah
 reCurse: Did I hear 10
 jacek: try 10
 Waffle3z: ten
 Counterbalance: 10 seems fine
 geppoz: if over 10, then it is 10 again :D
 Xenoid: It can basically be at most 10
 geppoz: since it will make no any difference
 RockyMullet: :sunglasses::thumbsup::thumbsup:
 jacek: :raised_hand: :raised_hand:
 Astrobytes: :digit_one: :digit_zero:
 kuhnchris: Ten-Ten
 ThomasNicoullaud: 0b1010

 kuhnchris: 2020 DIV 2
 Marcelo-Hackerman: i hate playing with bots
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you like playing with AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: solved it
 Automaton2000: paste your code into the ide
 Neumann: Has anyone successfuly setup BrutalTester with the challenge referee&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i just modified the referee for single core. next step: integrate engine into my own bot
 eulerscheZahl: the process communication is the biggest slowdown when you reduce the time per turn enough
 eulerscheZahl: and i failed to compile at first, had to replace 1 function
 eulerscheZahl: and reset the instance counter for recipes to 0
 ma: hm does CG have stome truble running the competition at the moment?
 Xenoid: submissions seem to have been broken for a couple of hours
 ma: k thx bye.
 tomatoes: Neumann <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/crazyiop/FallChallenge2020/tree/brutal-test">https://github.com/crazyiop/FallChallenge2020/tree/brutal-test</a>
 levbor: Looks like that. I've submitted code almost 2 hours ago and it's still at 11% 
 Doju: Wait.. is there a way to differentiate between exhausted spells and spells unavailable due to not having the resources
 levbor: is_castable
 Neumann: Thanks tomatoes, will check
 Doju: levbor that returns false on some spells even though the spells aren't greyed out
 meh1001: I was under the impression castable only indicates if it is exhausted or not, not if you can afford it
 Doju: so was i but it seems that it's not the case
 Doju: nvm, i'm just doing something wrong again
 Xanrum: how count enemy brews? not score, just count
 Ridakz: score &gt; previous_score
 xineohp: anybody facing issues with some rounds. for some reason I am getting the "has not provided 1 lines in time." message even if I am just reading the input and returning "WAIT"
 Remus_: ^ same
 Liora: Yeah I'm trying to setup a timer and the time seems so unstable not sure if the issue comes from my code or the server&#160;;/
 gaha: i didn't have any issues with the server
 gaha: apart of the area
 gaha: arena
 meh1001: it does seem extra slow right now
 MoonPhoenix: Do I need to keep my browser open for this?
 ngxingyu: no need. 
 Oursbrun: problem to submit the code
 Oursbrun: code vs zombies
 eulerscheZahl: the problem is in the whole website, staff is working on it
 Oursbrun: thanks
 LordSkaven: does your rank get reset when you submit? I was 90th now I am 1860th
 Oursbrun: no
 Grudo: yes, it is recalculating based on actual submit
 ngxingyu: yes mine went from 700 to 3000
 icecream17: what? my rank went up overnight
 meh1001: I would expect it to change as other people run theirs in the arena
 Xenoid: icecream17 submissions are broken, so everyone above you who submitted is temporarily below you
 icecream17: wow, imagine silver opening and the boss getting stuck
 LordSkaven: looks like things are getting better, I am actually getting new arena battle results
 Xenoid: yeah, submissions may be running again
 rmuskovets: my rank is changing too
 rmuskovets: in js sort() callback, if i want a to be placed before b, should i return -1 or 1?
 rmuskovets: ah, looked up on mdn
 Xenoid: -1. You return a number less than, equal to, or greater than 0 based on whether you want the first thing to be less than, equal to, or greater than the second thing
 rmuskovets: ty:)
 Marcelo-Hackerman: java takes really long to code right?
 Marcelo-Hackerman: to code, right?*
 Nerchio: no
 rmuskovets: my learning logic works... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/C8Xz0ax.png">https://i.imgur.com/C8Xz0ax.png</a> my bot learned every single skill excluding two
 rmuskovets: why does cg put you at the bottom of leaderboard when you start battles?
 rmuskovets: its taking sooooo damn long
 Uljahn: servers are slow atm, pls be patient
 MasterDuck: Take a walk outside while waiting. I sure need one. My brain hurts.
 EX53: for some reason in the coding challenge it takes 2 seconds just to read the input
 EX53: so i have no time to do anything else
 EX53: does anyone know how to fix it
 struct: 2 seconds to read inputs? In what language?
 tomatoes: start timer after first input
 Majeck: Yes
 EX53: i have private static classes but i left the input code the same
 Majeck: Not on the start of the while true
 EX53: java
 EX53: ya i did its its still the same
 EX53: the input code is the same i just have classes outside of the loop
 EX53: it shouldnt change anything tho i dont think
 struct: Does this happen on first turn?=
 dynamicritz: hi I can't do clash of code it gets stuck after timer reaches 0
 EX53: every turn
 struct: servers are having problems
 EX53: thats why it doesnt even run the rest of my code
 EX53: so what i just cant compete?
 struct: no, you can compete
 struct: your timeout is not related to server problems
 EX53: how can i compete when my code wont run
 EX53: oh
 rmuskovets: i feel like i shouldnt submit *this* version of my code
 rmuskovets: i was 2030-2010 while now i am 3004
 LastRick: Some of yall submitting some good code right now -- I've dropped 100 spaces in the past few minutes going to get coffee.
 Presac: Might just be the servers dropping...
 LastRick: What does that do to us?
 LastRick: (First contest so I truly dont know)
 struct: submits are currently frozen I think
 struct: ah they are working
 struct: just slow
 struct: There are many
 struct: 800 submits just on Fall challlenge
 LastRick: I get it. Does that mean your ranking is incorrect while that is stuck?
 struct: Well it needs to reach 100% so you know your final rank
 struct: you start from the bottom
 Tandy1000: i keep noticing sometimes when an opponent finishes a potion that i was about to complete, my code hangs.if two bots submit the brew for the same potion at nearly the same itme, what happens? does one get invalidated? how do you check for that?
 Tandy1000: there's no try - catch for issuing the brew command is there?
 struct: you both get it Tandy1000
 eulerscheZahl: same turn -&gt; both get the points
 LastRick: I'm just debugging and using the "Play My Code" but I see my ranking changing all the time. How do I know if my code is better? Do I have to use Test in Arena?
 struct: yes
 LastRick: oh
 struct: Or you can play vs other players in ide to check
 LastRick: i had been avoiding that because it takes so long
 struct: An easy way is to see the battles that you lost and send them to IDE
 struct: and check if your current code beats them
 LastRick: ok
 LastRick: to the bottom I go!
 Nazdael: Is there any good read I can do for this game, every time I start coding I feel like I am missing on something very important on how to manage my AI decision making.
 Nazdael: and what action is appropriate
 Zenoscave: Nazdael Take the time to create a model in your code. With the appropriate methods to build a simulation before going full in sim
 Zenoscave: also, PEWPEWPEW
 eulerscheZahl: current #3 giving hints
 eulerscheZahl: i'll take one
 Zenoscave: Euler your node counts are low. fixit. ezpz
 Nazdael: Not sure what you mean by appropriate methods for siming?
 eulerscheZahl: really?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: how many do you get?
 Zenoscave: I was double or tripling your counts in some cases.
 Zenoscave: similar ms
 Blacksoul: hey guys, anyone trying to solve the challenge with scala? I am trying to run it locally, my code on the web works, but when i ran it locally, the game engine wouldn't recognize my player. it doesn't fail or anything, it creates a player with my scala class, but in the first turn there is no output, and i am just disqualified
 eulerscheZahl: scala has some problems reported
 Zenoscave: Nazdael what language
 Blacksoul: anyone having the same issue while running it locally? (cloned the github project and added my class)
 struct: Zenoscave can I get a tip?
 Nazdael: c#
 eulerscheZahl: oh, for offline run: didn't test with scala
 SabertheLost: lol, I did wrong and it just keeps learing spells if it cannot cast anything
 Nazdael: Like spells, recipe, witch and game context?
 eulerscheZahl: can you run your bot from the command line? that way you could inject any bot
 Zenoscave: struct you don't show up on the bot plays
 Zenoscave: yes Nazdael
 SabertheLost: i think you can switch the bot in the idee?
 struct:&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: like:gameRunner.addAgent("dotnet /home/eulerschezahl/bot.dll");
 Zenoscave: did you just resubmit?
 struct: no
 eulerscheZahl: legend or delete?
 Nazdael: I have them but the thing is that I cannot figure out a good way to simualte how far I am from a brew and what is a good step - learn or cast
 Zenoscave: struct quit hiding
 Nazdael: I thought that I could calculate them like point distances, but it doesnt feel
 struct: I'm not hiding
 Blacksoul: i debugged a little bit, and the addAgent works, it is added. the issue comes from when it tries to get the output, it always gets a "" (empty string)
 Nazdael: right :D
 struct: Gold or delete is more fair I think
 eulerscheZahl: struct start coding
 roglemorph: anyone know why code royale says it cant process site ID
 roglemorph: my output is the exact same as the boss 
 struct: Ok ill start coding
 LastRick: Newb question: Is this generally how many players join a contest? Or is the lag due to high participation?
 eulerscheZahl: this is the biggest CG contest ever
 eulerscheZahl: last time was already close to 5k
 eulerscheZahl: before it was usually around 2.5k
 LastRick: double the normal? woah
 DomiKo: and only 20 T-shirts&#160;:(
 LastRick: people love anything Zelda i guess
 eulerscheZahl: there were contests with 2500 players and 50 tshirts
 eulerscheZahl: those days are over
 reCurse: There's been a big 'marketing' push, it's been 6 months since last contest and many people are in lockdown
 ToshiTuringMachine: one submit: 4 hours
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know where that marketing happened
 reCurse: Streamers
 reCurse: It's 2020
 eulerscheZahl: they have that much influence?
 reCurse: Apparnetly
 Nerchio: the marketing should say "you can code in any language but you can win only with C++ or Rust"
 Nerchio: :D
 _Lupus_: well kind of. Because the tome only shows the top 6 spells, one of them has the highest tax&#160;:)
 reCurse: So like real life?
 eulerscheZahl: there are like 20 people watching?
 reCurse: Sorry I include youtubers in streamers
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGCAgaZv99M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGCAgaZv99M</a>
 DomiKo: 3 days ago
 Remus_: Yeah, I wanted to say this too
 Nerchio: yeah Errichto is pretty popular
 eulerscheZahl: true, errichto has a fanbase
 dreadylein: its related to where they are streaming also, 20 people doesent sound much, but in tech category of twich this should be the upper 10% allready
 reCurse: It's also concurrent viewers
 reCurse: Doesn't say anything about total
 Nerchio: let's just say its all of those factors combined :p
 dreadylein: :P
 LastRick: Streamers are part of it but I think its mostly the "stuck at home" piece. I mean, I havent had this much time to code for fun in 15 years probably
 dreadylein: whatever it was, it seems like it worked
 reCurse: Might want to switch jobs
 reCurse: j/k
 LastRick: no offense taken
 eulerscheZahl: oh, he's streaming right now. and i pinged him. sorry
 Illedan: Yeah, I had 18 viewers on avreage in my stream, but 250 unique during those 4 hours
 dbf: yep, he is solving it with DP. so once he is done no one can compete because DP will find optimal solution -_-
 Illedan: Hmm, interesting
 Illedan: I'll add that to my list
 LastRick: I'm an engineer. We usually live at the plant or in our office but we've been kicked out bc of Covid to work from home. 
 Zenoscave: multi-Knapsack?
 LastRick: I guess I'm sunk. I cant use DP to solve this because Grand Festival 2 is giving me fits.
 Tandy1000: what's dp?
 DomiKo: dynamic programing
 struct: Also he streams in 2 places at once
 Zenoscave: crazy
 Majeck: Is there a way to know (Other than checking the current potions list with last turn's) if my opponent brewed a potion this turn?
 LastRick: their score?
 struct: if currentScore&#160;!= lastScore
 Majeck: Thanks
 Zenoscave: have submissions quit stalling?
 Xenoid: submissions seem to be running
 LordSkaven: they are still slow, but are running
 reCurse: It's exactly like traffic after a car accident has cleaned up
 reCurse: Gonna take a few hours
 LastRick: hah
 Zenoscave: You must not live near me. traffic after an accident is blazing fast until another redlight run causes a second accident
 reCurse: Still takes a while to go through the traffic that backed up
 Zenoscave: I see your point now. was missing that :P
 LastRick: I've been saying, traffic has been piling up in bronze for a day or so
 LordSkaven: yeah, in bronze league now. Only started yesterday this time, and first time doing something like this.
 Zenoscave: wonder if the pgsql 12.x caused it
 LastRick: is this typical for the contest to stagger opening up leagues? What is the thought process behind that?
 reCurse: They like living on the edge
 LastRick: HAH!
 reCurse: Last time upgrading languages before contest
 reCurse: Now upgrading db before contest
 reCurse: :thumbs_up:
 reCurse: :P
 Csipcsirip: does any1 know the name of the C++ std function, that inserts an element into a sorted vector in o(log2)
 Zenoscave: LastRick it is typical. no idea of the reasoning
 rcar: insert_element_sorted_vector_olog2()
 LastRick: thanks
 reCurse: The reasoning is to give more games to fewer players
 reCurse: And give a sense of progression
 reCurse: Also used to unlock additional rules but it was an experimental disaster
 Michael_Howard: How often are repeatable spells actually used by bots that handle them? Wondering how soon I should do this.
 Zenoscave: Csipcsirip  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.app/?q=sorted+insert+%20C%2B%2B">https://lmgtfy.app/?q=sorted+insert+%20C%2B%2B</a>
 Tandy1000: can i get a job from doing well in this 'challenge'?
 reCurse: Unlikely
 LastRick: yeah if i read this correctly, all the rules are open with bronze? so silver and above is just about tuning your code
 Zenoscave: I don't know of many US companies that use it. at least not in the regard you are approaching
 reCurse: Yeah
 Counterbalance: quick question - is c++ compiled in 32bit mode? Getting a compilation error that I also get locally with -m32 but not with -m64
 reCurse: I don't think so
 Csipcsirip: I used longer bitarrays than 32bit
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codingame.com/faq">https://codingame.com/faq</a>
 Zenoscave: Tandy1000 if you do well enough it may make an accolade mention in a resume. That helped me
 reCurse: "Your program is compiled and run in a Linux environment on a 64bit multi-core architecture."
 struct: Im sure its 64
 reCurse: Note that multi-core doesn't mean you have access to them
 Zenoscave: was about to say reCurse
 Counterbalance: that doesn't say whether the program is compiled in 64 or 32 bit mode, unfortunately
 reCurse: I wish this FAQ was a community wiki, then we could just have automaton spam it on a random trigger and cut our jobs
 reCurse: First time the bot would actually be useful
 Zenoscave: I like it
 Zenoscave: Good idea
 Zenoscave: todo item #1123801329867132
 reCurse: Counterbalance You could find that out with std::cerr &lt;&lt; sizeof(void*) &lt;&lt;std::endl;
 Xenoid: Csipcsirip, it's not possible to insert into a vector in O(log2 n) worst case. Vectors are stored contiguous in memory, so in the worst case an insert will involve moving at least half of the vector's elements. If you want fast insertion you need a different data structure.
 Zenoscave: Like a red-black tree?
 Xenoid: Sure, depending on what the other needs are
 Zenoscave: Doesn't STL set use a red-black tree
 aangairbender: it does
 Zenoscave: I mean that's not implementation specified but I think it's a safe bet
 aangairbender: according to the specificationSets are usually implemented as red-black trees.
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/insert/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/insert/</a>
 aangairbender: cppreference I mean
 Csipcsirip: ye xenoid, the insertion itself is ot l log2. i was looking for this btw: std::upper_bound
 Xenoid: Ah, I see. Never mind then, I misunderstood what you were asking
 AntonCosmin: is there a way to get the active code in arena instead of what I have in IDE?
 Zenoscave: history tab AntonCosmin
 Zenoscave: on the left of the window
 AntonCosmin: thanks a lot!!
 Xenoid: There is also std::binary_search for more general use
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/502438020">https://www.codingame.com/replay/502438020</a>that was a boring victory vs #1
 eulerscheZahl: on submit, not an IDE crash
 Zenoscave: I've had one of those too
 Zenoscave: my only win against
 aangairbender: I often see how #1 loses by not making enough deliveries, even Default wins him sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: IDe doesn't matter
 aangairbender: just too much learning, while opponent does the job
 eulerscheZahl: the bot behaves differently in IDE vs arena
 Zenoscave: IDE is a different bot. RUST is in debug mode in IDE
 icecream17: oh, repeatable spells??? how did i miss that
 aangairbender: And he uses Rust as well, rust could be x60 worse in IDE compared to the arena
 eulerscheZahl: ceg syndrome
 Zenoscave: blasterpoard eulerscheZahl Please resubmit. you're too close for comfort :P
 blasterpoard: Zenoscave this is just a test version, not meant to do well
 Zenoscave: ...
 LastRick: dang
 eulerscheZahl: my lucky streak is over...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vjkv5m">https://prnt.sc/vjkv5m</a>
 reCurse: That issue was raised months ago but not a priority I guess
 reCurse: Maybe this time it will be
 aangairbender: oh I see myself on #60 in your list euler
 struct: yeah, rust seems to be more popular now
 eulerscheZahl: and you lost :P
 struct: So I hope they address this problem
 CommanderCero: try blackmailing everyone who opposes you euler
 blasterpoard: reCurse reintroducing the bug I mentioned testerday actually improves my bot... luckily, I understood why after this version
 Zenoscave: CommanderCero ssshhhhh I oppose him
 icecream17: the spells that are not repeatable seem to be the ones that don't have negative delta...
 eulerscheZahl: nah, i'll just grab some food
 eulerscheZahl: still some TODOs for tomorrow
 reCurse: Happy ending
 Kirbiby: reCurse toi pas jouer ce contest&#160;?
 blasterpoard: now I have to completely rewrite the bot because I went the wrong way
 reCurse: Maybe
 jacek: Oo
 Kirbiby: Oh please explaint the wrong way to be top 5 :d
 Zenoscave: jacek hi
 jacek: good evening
 blasterpoard: Kirbiby it's bronze, bots are weak
 Zenoscave: hows your bot
 icecream17: The code agrees with me, can I depend on learns being repeatable if they cost something?
 jacek: still meh. theres seem to be bug in my spell's bfs.
 Kirbiby: weak, weak... The first 2 are undisputed since yesterday
 Zenoscave: not always icecream17
 Counterbalance: reCurse thanks.. its 64bit indeed, and it was (of course) a -Ofast bug.. -O2 made it compile.

 reCurse:&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: First 2 are major players it seems. I foresee them at least top 5 in legend. If they keep it up in improvements. higher
 blasterpoard: I have a version that tied psyh.o's bot, but now I'm mostly trying to figure out stuff
 reCurse: Psyho has a significant probability of dropping out
 Zenoscave: Due to the other competition?
 reCurse: Yeah or his own interest
 Zenoscave: fair
 blasterpoard: I also think emil is going to disappear at some point&#160;:)
 reCurse: Why
 blasterpoard: just a hunch
 kovi: whose smurf?
 Zenoscave: I'd agree to that hunch
 Zenoscave: ^^^^
 struct: Not sure if he will disapear though
 reCurse: :thinking:
 AntonCosmin: wow....my bot sometimes reads all the available input and sometimes it doesn't...how could that be?
 Zenoscave: timeout AntonCosmin
 Zenoscave: perhaps
 struct: or you are printing multiple times per turn
 struct: or printing without reading all inputs
 Zenoscave: one of these 3 is likely the cause
 AntonCosmin: I have games with 100 turns, if it's a timeout part of code will run next turn?
 Valdemar: AntonCosmin if you timeout on next turn you will see message about reading issues
 Michael_Howard: @icecream17 what is delta?
 icecream17: input: delta0, delta1, delta2, delta3: the four numbers describing the consumption/producion of ingredients for each tier.

 roglemorph: I think code royale is broken
 icecream17: michael_howard, what league are you in?
 icecream17: oh wait
 Zenoscave: ranks 5,6,7 all aiming for my spot at least
 Zenoscave: It was fun being top three for a few hours&#160;:) GL all
 Kalam132: do i need machine learning knowledge for these stuff?
 struct: no
 Zenoscave: nope Kirbiby
 Zenoscave: Kalam132****
 struct: Unless you want rank 1 on CSB
 Zenoscave: sorry Kirbiby
 Kirbiby: don't nope me :d
 Kalam132: what is CSB?
 Zenoscave: coders strike back
 jacek: or oware
 Michael_Howard: @icecream17 fair question given mine.&#160;:) I name it something else &amp; had forgotten. I'm bronze.
 icecream17: yeah i didn't use the word delta much before the contest
 cegprakash: omg battles are stuck
 jacek: impossibru
 cegprakash: and it's only 3 days into the contest
 jacek: its sunday
 Michael_Howard: Not stuck just s    l    o    w 
 Michael_Howard: :turtle:
 struct: Only 800 computing
 aangairbender: cause 3k players in the same league
 eulerscheZahl: because submit was stuck and now it's piling up
 aangairbender: oh I see
 jacek: lets spam submit more
 Zenoscave: no thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i'll let this one finish
 eulerscheZahl: already did 49 submits in C# :o
 eulerscheZahl: and 1 in PHP
 aangairbender: lol I was ~2500, then I watched how top guys play, and now I am ~700 and still submit is testing
 aangairbender: just started to learn a lot in the start
 Zenoscave: nice aangairbender
 eulerscheZahl: yet you couldn't avoid getting beaten by me :P
 aangairbender: uhh, I just made a submit and the very first battle was against you euler...
 Zenoscave: oops did you win?
 Michael_Howard: @icecream17 not sure about the repeatable - I just logged them, some produce more ingredients, some produce higher ingredients, some produce more tier value.
 Zenoscave: Because I didn't in my last against euler
 aangairbender: I dont have any simulations yet, only bfs for potion making, so I guess there is no any chance I could win xD
 Michael_Howard: @icecream17 if there's a strict pattern I can't see it
 icecream17: I was saying that a spell is repeatable if it doesn't only add ingredients
 aangairbender: oh I need to work on repeatable spells, now I am just ignoring that...
 icecream17: (it doesn't only add -&gt; subtracts somethinng)
 reCurse: And if it's not a starter spell
 icecream17: yeah
 Michael_Howard: Ah. That seems true.
 aangairbender: btw there is a repeatable flag in the input  
 icecream17: it is true: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/1a3428df225711bf76cb7588fa2e848825d750cf/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/spell/TomeSpell.java#L15">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/1a3428df225711bf76cb7588fa2e848825d750cf/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/spell/TomeSpell.java#L15</a>
 reCurse: Still helps since the viewer doesn't give that info without hovering
 Zenoscave: does anyone look at opponent sim yet? 
 Zenoscave: gz eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that went better than expected so far
 eulerscheZahl: opponent prediction is on my TODO
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure kovi does it going by the messages
 kovi:&#160;:)
 kovi: probably should reverse the order if im red....
 eulerscheZahl: you are my nemesis <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/fall-challenge-2020/eulerscheZahl">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/fall-challenge-2020/eulerscheZahl</a>
 kovi: just 1 game
 kovi: very nice submit anyway
 eulerscheZahl: i also had that random loss vs #704 :D
 eulerscheZahl: (not a timeout)
 cegprakash: wins: calls skills
 Michael_Howard: aangairbender yeah we know, but if it can only be one kind of spell it can affect what to code
 cegprakash: loses: calls random
 eulerscheZahl: "unexpected"
 Q12: If I slice an array and change one of the objects inside it does it affect the first array?
 theycallmedavid: If the slice part of the original array, yes. If it is "deep" copied, no.
 jke: What is the bonus points for tier-3 ingredients at end of game? I can't find it in the instructions.
 Q12: Thanks that what I thought. What is the meaning of "deep copied", like element by element?
 jke: Oh I found it.
 Xenoid: Q12, array slices to a shallow copy. So if you change an object in the slice, it will also change the object in the original array. That's only for objects though. If you have an array of strings, numbers, or booleans, then changing the slice won't change the original array
 Xenoid: jke, all tier1, tier2 and tier3 ingredients score 1 point. All that matters is they are above tier 0
 Q12: Thank you Xenoid and theycallmedavidIf I want to slice an array so when I changed an object it wouldn't change it in the original array, how can I do it?
 Q12: Never mind I solve it
 codeing: sup&#160;?
 codeing: what's up gay&#160;?
 codeing: tell me.
 codeing: the break is important in switch case&#160;?
 VizGhar: huh, u joking?&#160;:)
 codeing: what happen if my switch case don't have break&#160;?
 codeing: like this 
 VizGhar: if you match with first case, all other cases will be executed as well 
 VizGhar: most of the time you want to use break
 VizGhar: (I think it is language independent)
 codeing: java
 codeing: classic
 codeing: or object
 codeing: `tets`
 VizGhar: you can google it pretty easily
 codeing: this code is ok&#160;?
 LastRick: in dart, the reason to not use break is if you want it to catch multiple cases
 codeing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.fr/73332">http://pastebin.fr/73332</a>
 codeing: exactly with internet, we already have break.
 VizGhar: Of course it will work... but maybe not the way you want it to&#160;:)
 codeing: like&#160;?
 VizGhar: &gt; if you match with first case, all other cases will be executed as well 
 VizGhar: go ahead :D
 codeing: yeah.
 codeing: true
 GabrielDCelery: hiya, does anyone know whats the best way to tell if your bot times out?
 codeing: but why&#160;?
 VizGhar: Best way to know for sure is to check console output&#160;:)
 codeing: yeah i try this.
 GabrielDCelery: I dont see anything on the console
 icecream17: i wish last battles that timeout or draw are highlighted or something
 GabrielDCelery: I assume it times out because my opponent provides a command and i dont but it doesnt throw any error
 VizGhar: Are we talking about timeout in current Contest?
 GabrielDCelery: yes the potion brewer
 LastRick: if it times out, it will explicitly say so (I know from SO MUCH experience)
 VizGhar: if so, you should see timeout there
 codeing: mhm
 VizGhar: try sleep thread for 2 seconds so you know for sure
 codeing: but do case of switch are like loop&#160;?
 VizGhar: And scroll to absolute bottom. Im 100% sure you will see it there
 Illedan: Nice eulerscheZahl
 VizGhar: no. switch isn't loop
 GabrielDCelery: thanks!
 codeing: why break so&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i got my screenshot for the collection, now i can go home
 Illedan: xD
 LastRick: call it a day
 eulerscheZahl: and back to 2nd
 GabrielDCelery: this is one of the games that I suspect times out<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/502499299">https://www.codingame.com/replay/502499299</a>
 LastRick: and the dream ends
 VizGhar: break will stop execution of current block of code.&#160;:)
 codeing: mhm
 codeing: so something like this is cool&#160;?
 codeing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.fr/73335">http://pastebin.fr/73335</a>
 codeing: replace break by return
 codeing: because break for me is specific for loops .
 VizGhar: @Gabriel hmm can't see it in console either... try to send game parameters to IDE with code used back then... maybe you have just encountered bug. Many players mentioned some troubles  last hour
 VizGhar: @codeing return will immediately "finish" current method
 VizGhar: Just play with it a bit, you will understand it soon
 codeing: what difference with break in switch case&#160;?
 HHannahh12: yo
 VizGhar: google it&#160;:)
 GabrielDCelery: @VizGhar thanks Ill try to figure it out
 codeing: sure
 codeing: thx
 VizGhar: np
 fyusuf-a: Hey, do you know if both players take the same potion with a bonus, the countdown of bonuses is reduced by 2&#160;?
 fyusuf-a: It seems implied by the rules.
 Xenoid: It is reduced by 2, yes
 fyusuf-a: +1 Xenoid, thanks.

 Neumann: Opinions about minmax&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i should convert to chokudai
 MadKnight: Illedan when Illemax&#160;?
 Astrobytes: simultaneous though, minimax not ideal. Also seems your own witch is more important
 Illedan: MinMax might work Neumann, wonder when someone starts the WAIT meta
 Zenoscave: What's the difference between beam and chokudai&#160;? I always forget
 cegprakash: MadKnight good to see u after long time
 MadKnight: who needs WAIT when u can just output invalid commands&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: wait for what? opponent solving a bonus quest so you get the full 3 point bonus after?
 eulerscheZahl: beam: fixed width, variable depthchokudai: fixed depth
 Zenoscave: huh
 Neumann: If he's minmaxing too he won't complete his task. Deadlock. ggs
 Zenoscave: interesting
 MadKnight: wonder when somebody figures it out what to wait for
 Illedan: Nah, stack up on ingredients and then try to take customers right before the enemy does. To supply block him :D
 eulerscheZahl: did you see the replay magus shared on discord?
 cegprakash: waiting for bonus quest sounds crazy
 Illedan: Yeah

 PheonixVX: What do the stars on a puzzle mean? Difficulty? If so, why is a 4 star listed as easy? Is it the stars that are dark gray that denote the difficulty?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rating by coders
 jacek: if they liked it
 LastRick: if you mean the IN OUT puzzle it is the rating by people who finished it
 LastRick: which is very subjective since we all have different reasons for our grading
 Q12: What is the ideal ratio between the number of turns it takes to provide an order and the price of the order?
 PheonixVX: Thanks
 Waffle3z: 1:23
 Q12: :joy:
 LastRick: q12: I guess that's part of the puzzle for each of us
 eulerscheZahl: check some replays from the top and compute finalScore/turnCount
 blasterpoard: then multiply it by about 1.2
 Q12: Nice! didn't think of it, thanks eulerscheZahl

 icecream17: it's one of the best foods, like pizza
 Q12: agreed
 DanTheMan832: How come nobody is higher than bronze yet? Last time I played one of these lots of people were in the highest league.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: allergic to ice cream  :cry:
 icecream17: silver hasnt opened yet
 LastRick: we all decided to play together this time
 _Lupus_: Silver league not opening until tomorrow
 Beresta: what time it opens btw?
 Astrobytes: Hammer time
 LastRick: Closing time
 tomatoes: in ~24h
 Q12: the battles in arena is working now, yeah? because I don't want to submit my bot and stuck in a bad rank because of it
 eulerscheZahl: it's fine
 Q12: :thumbsup:
 ParticleBeam: Bot has swung between 180 and 260...
 cegprakash: do lower league submissions get less priority over higher league submissions? I think it's better to have at least 1 dedicated server for each league
 cegprakash: my sisters' submission in wood2 was stuck for looong time
 Zenoscave: you can pay for that then&#160;;)
 cegprakash: yeah I'm ready to pay :D
 cegprakash: lets share
 eulerscheZahl: lower leagues have less matches. but i don't think they have to wait longer
 Astrobytes: your sister plays on CG also ceg?
 eulerscheZahl: a while ago the whole submit was stuck
 Zenoscave: does she read the description?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: @Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol Zeno
 Astrobytes: Awesome cegprakash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: that was no a yes @zeno
 Zenoscave: Family code!
 eulerscheZahl: so she doesn't?
 cegprakash: I read description
 cegprakash: and I ask if I can't understand
 cegprakash: I don't know what's there to troll about it
 Zenoscave: tbh the description confuses me too sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't understand the tax instantly
 eulerscheZahl: and the spells disappearing after cast did the rest
 cegprakash: the animation is super good
 eulerscheZahl: "oh no, they are all gone! oh wait there they are"
 cegprakash: making the rules understand
 cegprakash: from animations
 icecream17: in the settings you can set hide exhausted spells to off
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 Nerchio: at the start you couldn't
 Nerchio: disappearing spells also confused me
 Soulee: Hello,what is this warning  
 eulerscheZahl: julien added the switch based on the feedback
 eulerscheZahl: do you print multiple lines in each loop soulee?
 icecream17: Your code output before getting input
 kuhnchris: how does the ranking in the Fall Challenge work? I seem to beat my opponents, yet i'm still around rank 1100
 icecream17: So you probably output twice or something
 eulerscheZahl: ranking = TrueSkill algorithm
 Bobbadillio: Yeah, that warning happened to me when I was accidentally outputting twice
 BookSaver: Soulee, maybe your bot have not time to post command , too long calculate.
 Soulee: yes I print a stream
 Soulee: I add items to a steam and then I print them in forEach loop
 Zenoscave: you can only print one command each turn
 Zenoscave: then there will be more input to read
 Soulee: I can print insie actionCount loop?
 Beresta: btw what happens inbetween turns? any way to compute more while waiting for input or something? :D 
 Michael_Howard: @kuhnchris you must beat them more :smiling_imp:
 eulerscheZahl: you read all the input. and then print 1 single line of output
 eulerscheZahl: no printing in inner loops
 Soulee: Ok thanks for the warning!
 Waffle3z: how do you avoid timeouts in C++? I'm checking if (std::clock() - startTime &gt; 49000) and printing asap afterwards but I still time out sometimes
 jacek: 1ms might be not enough
 eulerscheZahl: i have 40ms and 1 or 2 timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: garbage collected language might be at fault here
 Beresta: btw is there any way to completely shut down gc in C#?
 xSkyline: Can I view my games against the players on the top of the leaderboard&#160;?
 HungryBurger: I think you can specify any opponent for your bot to battle against.
 HungryBurger: On the IDE, there's a "Players" section, it usually has your name and the name of the boss.
 HungryBurger: Press "delete" underneath your boss, and I think it'll let you pick a new opponent.
 eulerscheZahl: always keep a reference Beresta :P
 Beresta: weeeeeel it won't prevent it right? at least first two times till your stuff gets to gen2 and won't be checked frequently
 pedrosorio: @HungryBurger I only see players in top 1000
 pedrosorio: Does anyone know how the score is computed for the top 100 companies and top 100 schools?
 DanTheMan832: I was just getting the hang of it and now theres a bunch of extra stuff in bronze league&#160;:(
 pedrosorio: @DanTheMan832 that's half of the fun, you don't have too much time to "hyper optimize" one set of rules, it keeps chaaangin 
 xSkyline: Got it, thanks @HungryBurger&#160;!
 DeWitt: My bot have spent all the items to get one brew, not he is waiting for the whole game to get a free spell
 DeWitt: :D
 Remus_: rest maybe? :D
 DeWitt: hm
 DeWitt: ok, it is a bug. i have free +2 spell, but it doesn't want to use it
 pedrosorio: this is what I like about coding bots, we talk about them as if they had free will :P
 Remus_: Well, in my case it's true, because I sure don't know what the heck it's doing
 pedrosorio: haha
 pedrosorio: I knew exactly what my bot was doing, but between the previous version and the current one I added so many tunable parameters that I now have no intuition how to change them to get the bot to perform better xD
 Gronahak: Hi&#160;! My bot is acting weird on the ladder for some fights so I send it to the IDE to debug, and there he acts normally. Any ideas as to why&#160;? :thinking: I do not use any RNG
 HungryBurger: Maybe the opponent is using RNG?
 Nerchio: depends on what "acting weird' means
 rwilson: Gronahak - do you have anything limited by time spent? Likely to be different beween ide &amp; arena.
 Gronahak: @HungryBurger have this problem for several opponents but maybe 
 pedrosorio: @Gronahak, you can also press "replay in same conditions" several times to see how it acts in multiple runs with same initial conditions
 lambrosk: Guys what is the point of placing tax?
 Gronahak: @Nerchio Just doing a WAIT instead of acting ^^
 lambrosk: I tried learning a spell at index 2 or 3 without having tax
 lambrosk: and it worked
 HungryBurger: Last content, I saw a battle where my bot lost in a very specific way I wanted to fix, so I brought it into the IDE, and it wouldn't repro.
 pedrosorio: @lambrosk, if the perfect spell is there and you want it and don't want your opponent to have it
 lambrosk: ohh
 pedrosorio: @lambrosk :O
 lambrosk: so a tax prevents enemy from learning
 Nerchio: @Gronahak well maybe you changed the code between arena and now or something idk
 lambrosk: i musth ave missread
 rwilson: lambrosk - tax works both ways...   read careful
 pedrosorio: @lambrosk, no you pay the tax to get the spell at index &gt; 0
 Gronahak: Thanks for the feedback all :D 
 lambrosk: okay got it thank you
 rwilson: pedrosorio and you GET the tax on any spell you learn  ... so if the free one has 10 blue on it, you get a nice full inventory to deal with.
 pedrosorio: haha 
 Gronahak: @rwilson I do actually, this could very well be the reason why
 pedrosorio: I haven't gotten that deep into it, but I suppose collecting a lot of blue can slow you down in some cases
 icecream17: uh, do any of you have the website which shows all the inputs and debugging for a game replay id?
 jacek: codingame.com
 jacek: and use arrows to read those :v

 icecream17: instead of
 DeWitt: :D
 icecream17: CAST ID Repeat
 Astrobytes: Shocking Scarfield, shocking :P
 DeWitt: let me try
 DeWitt: thanks
 pedrosorio: @LastRick but percentage cutoff is weird, because you can make it there any time until the fall challenge ends, right?
 icecream17: You can use other symbols to prevent the repeat: CAST ID //comment
 DeWitt: interesting
 Michael_Howard: If you learn a spell at index 1, with 1 tax on it (i.e. enough to pay) but have no blue, do you get the spell &amp; break even, or is it "no you can't have credit till end of turn"
 LastRick: again, i dont know. but there has to be some criteria for where they stick the boss in bronze, correct?
 icecream17: The separator is a space for both for some reason
 Scarfield: pedrosorio yea you can league up until contest ends, and the "contest" will be available as multiplayer after it ends
 LastRick: so thats been my criteria for success in bronze (and i might be wrong): I find someone ranked around 40% and play against their code in my IDE
 icecream17: Every time I lose it's either super close or I lose by &gt;30 points
 icecream17: And nothing seeems to be wrong, i'm just making a few less potions, and my bot seeems to be doing something
 Scarfield: hmm thought i had seen Doctor Who being on Netflix, apparently not
 Astrobytes: Oh they removed it to the BBC one and Amazon I think Scarfield
 Astrobytes: 'Britbox'
 Scarfield: sadness, have heard that its great, just never seen it
 Astrobytes: Story-wise it's a bit weak currently but it's great yeah
 Majeck: Fellas what do you think is better, a potion that gives me 10 rupees in 5 turns or a potion that gives me 4 rupees in 2 turns
 LastRick: A little frustrating. I see a game in the Arena where my code times out. I send those parameters to the IDE and replay and I DON'T timeout. How do I debug this?
 Astrobytes: There are always torrent-y solutions ofc
 Scarfield: the big library yes

 Scarfield: ooh nice link euler, didnt realise emi l was errichto
 Astrobytes: oh errichto's taking a DP approach. How surprising :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: watch launch, it's at 7:27 EST
 Scarfield: wait lol, he was watching a replay xD
 eulerscheZahl: emil is not Erricht o
 Scarfield: and i failed misserably at not pinging
 Astrobytes: so did euler 
 Astrobytes: :D
 pedrosorio: @icecream17 if they use a rule similar to "better than default Ai bot", you should make it easily
 icecream17: i think the boss is gonna be around 250th
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my bot is learning stuff, but i haven't figured out the tax yet.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the default is still kicking my butt 80% of the time
 LastRick: I'll confess, I still don't understand repeatable
 icecream17: repeatable: if true, you can do the cast multiple times in 1 turn
 eulerscheZahl: AB =&gt; CD also includesAABB =&gt; CCDD
 ParticleBeam: Repeatable allows you to cast the spell multiples times in one round if you have the ingredients
 eulerscheZahl: and AAABBB =&gt; CCCDDDAAAABBBB =&gt; CCCCDDDD
 struct: If I get gold Ill call it an achievement
 struct: I have no clue what Im doing
 LastRick: i guess i never have enough ingredients then
 icecream17: repeatable is true if:not 4 basic spellssubtracts at least 1 ingredient
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lost 400 places on leaderboard overnight again, people arre putting in some effort
 DeWitt: when i am buying a cast, do i need to have evnough items in the begging of the purchase, or i can use ones that are on the cast?(tax)
 icecream17: enough items in the begnninng
 icecream17: "The read-ahead tax is applied after learnt spells have disappeared from the tome,"
 icecream17: followed by something i dont understand " meaning new spells may be present in the 6 available when the ingredients are placed."
 ntroPi: thats because the other player may have learned a skill too
 ntroPi: so your tax may be placed on a skill that was too far up before you chose.
 LastRick: Patrick: Same. I've lost 200 spots today with code that is my better (IMO) than early. I mean yesterday I was never break 70 rupees. Today, hit 116. But others are cranking too. Place has been busy all day.
 ToshiTuringMachine: DeWitt You may only do this if you can afford it. tax incomes after

 icecream17: Hi
 Gabbek: quite busy day I see, so many people in bronze now, very nice.
 Gabbek: The silver league opens tomorrow?
 icecream17: (i'm gonna test some emoticons) =)&#160;:)  :D =D
 Gabbek: I see 4, if that helps you icecream17 :P
 icecream17: uh yeah it opens tomorrow
 icecream17: there's this one with an even bigger mouth for some reason :grinning:
 Gabbek: that's actually scary, haha
 icecream17: ooh there's :ice_cream:
 icecream17: the food emoji section looks delicious
 Astrobytes: icecream17 you don't have to test them all out, they work
 <b>**Scarfield can sense a challenge</b></p><p><img src="/a/42082469656497" /> icecream17: no i was originally testing emoticons...
 icecream17: lol scarfield
 Astrobytes: don't be obtuse
 Gabbek: that emoji would fit your avatar well, icecream17&#160;:)
 icecream17: like ":" + ")"
 rcar: there's actually 2 of them that don't work. you should try them all until you find them
 Gabbek: * googles obtuse

 Astrobytes: lol that's not necessary struct
 Astrobytes: icecream is cool :P
 Scarfield: sigh xD
 icecream17: some less used ones might be useful though, i found :grey_question:

 Gabbek: :ballot_box_with_check: emoji testing - done
 icecream17: This checkmark looks better :white_check_mark:
 Astrobytes: Alright, we know
 icecream17: oh now it looks un circle-ish. slightly pixelated, non-vector
 Scarfield: I have a feeling the productivity of us in chat right now is about the same :p
 Astrobytes: wanna test emojis? make a channel, join it, spam away
 Scarfield: #Emogees
 icecream17: (pun i didn't notice) icecream is cool

 Astrobytes: And watching chat ofc
 Astrobytes: hashtag NoCodeTilMonday
 Scarfield: i have been on about an hour, all i have done so far is assigning an array with new root nodes. Might as well admit defeat for today
 PatrickMcGinnisII: says there's 42 learn spells, but i found 64 so far
 icecream17: the witches smile when it just sits there and does nothing is...
 rwilson: PatrickMcGinnisII found 64 unique spells&#160;? or just 65 unique id's for learnable spells so far&#160;:)

 Astrobytes: Oh struct beat me to it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I started with that list
 AllYourMCTS: what do you mean the id can change?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then when i run, everytime a tome spell isn't found in the lookup, i add it
 Scarfield: from game to game
 Scarfield: AllYourMCTS
 AllYourMCTS: how?? they are always initialized in the same order aren't they?
 Astrobytes: lol, AllYourOre?
 AllYourMCTS:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 0 -3 3 0 not set in TOME
 PatrickMcGinnisII: found another

 Scarfield: line 36
 icecream17: it's in github but not in your list
 Scarfield: have you copied the spells as tomes by mistake?
 icecream17: So 42 learns, and 36 potions
 Scarfield: oh yea i meant potions not spells.
 icecream17: i think they're actually called brews
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, nha there in the same order
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah
 icecream17: i just call them learns and potions in my code
 icecream17: learns = tomes
 struct: what's max possible id?
 struct: under 256 right?
 Scarfield: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my middle two numbers are reversed in every one, wtf
 Scarfield: there is not enough tomes and spells to sum so high
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I cut paste directly from the github
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how would middle two numbers be reversed

 PatrickMcGinnisII: icecream17 yup that's the 42
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, i gotta go thru mine...no idea how values got switched ... i got a ghost in my machine
 gitKad: What do you guys do to measure a turns elapsed time in Javascript? I thout performance.now() would be precise enough, but most of my round take " 80 ms " without getting disqualified... 
 icecream17: start the timer after the first input
 Astrobytes: ^
 rwilson: gitKad - be extra careful with your timings.  it's pretty easy to accidentally be timing 'your time+opponent time'   
 gitKad: Ha wow. Thank you very much :thumbsup_tone2:
 icecream17: those candles look very dangerous
 gitKad: Love it, my clocks went from ~80ms / turn to &lt; 2 ms / turn :grin:
 Astrobytes: Knowledge is power gitKad&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, my bot works better now that the values are correct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :8ball: in my machine
 LastRick: weird how it works that way
 ToshiTuringMachine: how do you cope with opponents moves? every move creates a new tree... with trees on every leaf?
 adouz: can someone explain to me why my inventory have 11 ingredients when i learned in 19/53 move: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/502700238">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/502700238</a>
 ToshiTuringMachine: just montecarlo?
 Remus_: lol
 rwilson: adouz - when you learned, you collected the 2 blue on that spells tax 
 adouz: rwilson - but in the rules at Learning Spells: it says '...If the witch's inventory is full, the excess is discarded.'
 rwilson: which is what it's showing in the replay.  i don't actually see a point where you have 11 in inventory ( it sortof animates it, but then animates the discarding of it )
 ToshiTuringMachine: you can't have 11. it's 10 
 ToshiTuringMachine: rwilson is correct
 Astrobytes: excess is discarded so your inventory maxes out at 10
 Astrobytes: :digit_one::digit_zero:
 adouz: is that mean that it just problem with animation?
 Astrobytes: the frames don't always match up to the data (sometimes), trust the data
 rwilson: to be fair, the animation in the replay does show 1 of the blue push into inventory - making the tier-3 dorito chip smash into the middle of the inventory area -- but it immediately gets animated back ( on Chrome ) ... could be getting stuck on other browser
 adouz: alright i was just confused, thank u
 cegprakash: Magus printing some probability in messages lol
 Keb: Hi, quick question, do you know if it's possible to require("pref_hooks") in typescript&#160;?
 phord: Witchy-talk is public debugging.  lol
 rwilson:&#160;;) i prefer the ones that use it to smack talk&#160;;) 
 phord: I assumed that's what it's for, but I don't watch the animations, tbh.
 Astrobytes: you'll see all kinds of output there :D
 phord: The replay animation just shows up as a black screen for me (Linux, Brave browser).  I get the first frame, and then the rest is black. 
 Astrobytes: I'd recommend closing the browser (or just the tab, prob browser) and try again 
 Icebox: I hereby present you

 Good_Coder: Bruh
 rwilson: Nice&#160;;)   seen a bunch of 12-ish in arena... never seen tax get that high though ....     IDE playing against someone? or your own bot?
 Icebox: against myself
 Loran: that is an impressive tax count
 rwilson:&#160;;) you really don't like that spell for some reason then ... huh&#160;?
 Astrobytes: tf though
 aristotelis-bobas: looool 
 cegprakash: all top 100 have some tree based search :o
 cegprakash: that makes me sad
 cegprakash: I have not even started a search yet
 dreadylein: mh&#160;?
 dreadylein: ah
 LastRick: Does the game give you you and your opponents scores as data?
 Astrobytes: second loop
 Astrobytes: you're player i==0
 rwilson: LastRick - last INT on the inventory input lines.. 
 LastRick: oh yeah, its with the inventory. Hidden away in a subroutine, thanks everyone
 Astrobytes: np
 LastRick: if your code is like mine, it's a mile long
 Astrobytes: Mines just a few more lines than the default to get to Bronze, not coding properly until tomorrow
 LastRick: *weeps into code***
 AFOLOGO: kh
 Astrobytes: anyway, goodnight/happy coding/good luck/have fun etc. See you all tomorrow
 LastRick: night
 Gabbek: good night
 phord: How can you tell that another player has a tree-based search?
 Atomic_coder: morning
 dreadylein: hey
 Good_Coder: morning
 Hjax: does someone have a brutaltester referee for the contest?
 Nerchio: hjax
 Nerchio: run from java quickly
 Nerchio: in this contest :D
 aCat: run from java always :D
 Illedan: Java runs on everything
 dreadylein: mhh
 dreadylein: why run from it&#160;? :P
 Remus_: Crew-1 launch in 1 min if anyone is interested
 Illedan: ty
 Cappefra: so my bfs can't handle more than 4 spells without timeouts
 Cappefra: I'm already avoiding visited nodes...
 dreadylein: time for optimizimg&#160;:) 
 Cappefra: hints on how to optimize?
 dreadylein: what language are you using&#160;?
 Cappefra: c#
 Gabbek: I have a very weird issue, anyone has some idea what could it be?
 dreadylein: yeah gc most likely
 dreadylein: @cappefra in this case you have tons of options for sure&#160;:)
 cegprakash: add a feature -&gt; rank drops
 Gabbek: Cappefra - I would suggest a bit of pruning
 Gabbek: if you have 2 spells available: 1st which generates 3 blues, and 2nd which generates 2 blues - always use 3 blues, for example
 dreadylein: basicly check what could eat up a lot of cycles, simplify logic, think about the smallest way you can save the gamestate, try to decrease branching condition to a minimum, thinking about function calls and if they are absolutly needed or if you can inline them 
 Gabbek: dreadylein any idea if you can do something about garbage collection then?
 dreadylein: if you want to motivate yourself eulersche is at #1 atm seems to visit around 30-60k nodes in c# 
 Gabbek: noowhere close to eulersche, but I would like to atleast not timeout due to situation like this&#160;:(
 Remus_: That is kinda bonkers, I am trying to match him, but can't get over 20k atm&#160;:( Also mine is buggy as hell
 Gabbek: and using 20ms instead of 50ms doesn't sound like a good solution :D
 dreadylein: you can try to give the ilvm a hint to not gc by marking it critical, but this only works if you actualy sure you dont need to :P
 pedrosorio: Rank 200, visiting 400 unique nodes in Python :D
 Gabbek: nice one pedrosorio :D
 dreadylein: best is normaly not to create toomany stuff that needs to be collected
 cegprakash: how euler earns 50 rupees more than me in every game
 Gabbek: so I should change my game actions from a class to an int, correct?
 dreadylein: most likely cheating :D
 dreadylein: it depends, but in this case yeah it will most likely help
 Gabbek: well then, I'll try that tomorrow - thank you very much for the insight
 Gabbek: I just couldn't figure out anything so I've asked, thanks a lot&#160;:)
 dreadylein: np
 linjoehan: I'm still thinking about how to do this one.
 KrabbyFR: Good evening! Can someone help me with this? 
 KrabbyFR: or only to the first one who learned it?
 dreadylein:&#160;?
 dreadylein: the first spell is always free
 dreadylein: or what do you mean
 KrabbyFR: for both of them?
 dreadylein: at least if iirc
 dreadylein: yeah should be
 Hjax: when one witch takes it from the shop, the other cant have it anymore 
 Hjax: er, tome
 KrabbyFR: yeah 
 Hjax: if they take it at the same time, they both get it 
 pedrosorio: yes, the first spell you receive in the input is free
 KrabbyFR: sorry I yeah I used another term xD 
 Loran: yeah free for bottom slot. since both take at same time they both get tax and it has no cost.
 KrabbyFR: ok thank you, seems like I can't learn the first tome for free somehow&#160;:/ let me see where's the bug lol 
 KrabbyFR: ah, so like you cannot learn for free the last tome for example?
 KrabbyFR: nvm
 KrabbyFR: thanks hahaha
 Loran: yes first in order not as in the first spell you buy
 alexthe2: can I install pip packages?
 Hjax: no
 alexthe2: can I create multiple files?
 Hjax: no
 alexthe2: ok thanks
 KrabbyFR: hum actually I can't figure that out: my witch first actionw as to learn the most expensive tome, but it says not enough ingredients to learn
 Hjax: you have to pay the tax 
 Hjax: 1 tier 0 ingredient per page in the tome 
 KrabbyFR: ok, what is free then?
 Loran: which is stored at tome_index
 Hjax: the first one is free
 KrabbyFR: ....
 dreadylein: the first one is free means
 Hjax: the second one costs 1, third one costs 2 
 dreadylein: the first spell in the list&#160;:)
 KrabbyFR: omg I'm so sorry hahaha
 dreadylein: so basicly learn 0 is always free hehe
 Hjax: yeah what dreadylein says 
 KrabbyFR: ok I thought the very first "one learned" is free hahaha
 KrabbyFR: I need to walk away from my screen for a bit I think, but it's so addicting
 KrabbyFR: thanks guys!
 AbsentMoon: Does anyone mind giving me some strategies for picking spells to learn and a system of how you implement those spells?
 icecream17: that's what the contest is about
 icecream17: i mean, i try to calculate how helpful each spell is
 icecream17: *learn, tome
 icecream17: well, first actually,
 icecream17: i use the fastWayToDoEachRecipe
 icecream17: and then choose the most helpful learn or spell, or do a potion
 icecream17: some people simulate games to see which option is the best
 AbsentMoon: Interesting. Thanks for the help. I might just manually put in the ones I think are best lol
 Weltal327: Can anyone give me advice on how to figure out why my code doesn't deliver an output in time?
 Lysk: run it locally (by copypasting some valid inputs)?
 AllYourMCTS: print out times at various points in your code

 Lysk: nice!
 BrunoFelthes: @Weltal327 are you using language with garbage collector?
 AbsentMoon: Does anyone have a list of the tome spells with their ID's? I have the list off GitHub, but I don't want to go through the process of figuring out the ID's.
 Counterbalance: the ids change when they're learned so I didn't bother. I just check for the deltas to get an index in a static array.
 LastRick: Amazing how many people are playing this contest
 danjrauch: Can you compile with c++14?
 Counterbalance: servers use c++17
 AbundantPuddle: To make things easy on myself, I like to make all my variable names one character.

 NoobCod3: cool replay
 ClockSort: when Silver league open?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: notsure
 Zenoscave: 12 hours or so? sometime on the 16th
 NoobCod3: can someone help me code&gt;
 NoobCod3: i need to learn
 NoobCod3: cause I'm trying to compete against my cousin
 Rodrigo_the_coder: what language
 NoobCod3: hes learning computer programming and I don't know what language he is using
 Rodrigo_the_coder: just take-a-peek
 NoobCod3: @Rodrigo_the_coder python or JavaScript
 NoobCod3: mostly python i wanna learn
 Rodrigo_the_coder: ya
 Rodrigo_the_coder: infinite loop = while True:
 Rodrigo_the_coder: @success
 NoobCod3: thats a code?
 NoobCod3: for what language
 Rodrigo_the_coder: python
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/">https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/</a>
 Zenoscave: Here, this is a good overview
 Zenoscave: anthing starting with "#" is a comment and just to explain.
 Rodrigo_the_coder: docs.python.org
 Rodrigo_the_coder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org">https://docs.python.org</a>
 Rodrigo_the_coder: a good overview
 Rodrigo_the_coder: from tkinter import *
 Rodrigo_the_coder: window = Tk()
 Rodrigo_the_coder: #popup window
 NoobCod3: can you give me more codes for python?
 NoobCod3: i will follow you
 Rodrigo_the_coder: ok
 ClockSort: best to use std::clock for tracking time used in C++?
 NoobCod3: i will private chat you @Rodrigo_the_coder
 ClockSort: ironic that a guy named ClockSort can't use a clock :P
 Rodrigo_the_coder: for noobcod3: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d4850390-b2f8-4739-b1cc-7e6199d2b150">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d4850390-b2f8-4739-b1cc-7e6199d2b150</a>
 ClockSort: here's the ClockSort algorithm:
 ClockSort: eventually the bits corrupt into a sorted list
 Zenoscave: ClockSort use high_resolution_clock or steady_clock
 Zenoscave: std::chrono::
 ClockSort: thanks
 Zenoscave: they're more accurate for CG pruposes
 Ifthel: Clock Sort &lt; Intelligent Design Sort
 ClockSort: I've had it with the C# garbage collector. Switching to C++ now.
 Zenoscave: ClockSort gc can be bypassed if you keep memory alive between methods. IE static global refs
 ClockSort: Zenoscave I'm doing that
 Rodrigo_the_coder: #include <time></time>
 Zenoscave: Still getting gc'ed?
 ClockSort: yeah
 Zenoscave: hm. must be losing a openref
 ClockSort: it should be ok to new a struct in my loop, right? it goes on the stack and bypasses GC?

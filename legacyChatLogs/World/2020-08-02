 saul-melo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK isn't drawing the 3rd line of a polygon with 3 corners. Is that a bug?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/0FyqmYE">https://imgur.com/a/0FyqmYE</a>
 Ripkite: yo anybody in a cool developer's discord
 Ripkite: not someone famous
 Ripkite: just like a chill coders discord
 Ripkite: is that not a thing?
 Ripkite: should i start one
 jacek: with blackjack and hookers
 eulerscheZahl: and chill coders
 eulerscheZahl: whenever I visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://craftpix.net/">https://craftpix.net/</a> they have their annual 40% discount about to end in 1 or 2 days
 eulerscheZahl: and the timer even shows different dates depending on whether I use my main computer or my laptop (maybe because i'm only logged in on one of those devices)
 jacek: pro tip: change the date back a few days to get more time
 SPDene: eulerscheZahl or just clear cookies/use a different browser
 SPDene: it's just a pressure sales tactic
 eulerscheZahl: incognito is enough already <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/thJAdFP">https://imgur.com/a/thJAdFP</a>
 aCat: oh, yet another one site with assets
 aCat: didn't kn-w this one, nice
 eulerscheZahl: i got my Onitama assets from there
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/479048540">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/479048540</a>the knights and wizards for free
 eulerscheZahl: so i'm a fan of craftpix
 eulerscheZahl: well, the knight only existed in red. so i scripted the blue one
 SPDene: I see that fake countdown thing and immediately leave. so it doesn't always work
 eulerscheZahl: they have some nice sprites for free. right now i'm looking for some rocks as background
 jacek: new game the struct was working on with you?
 eulerscheZahl: new game that i'm now doing alone&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the rocks aren't part of the game, just decorso i can tell it without spoiling
 jacek: so its not rock paper scissors
 eulerscheZahl: and then i'm harass Thibaud
 eulerscheZahl: i'm =&gt; i'll
 jacek: where was that RPS game?
 aCat: so many games to crate&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have the RPS link anymore
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't think it would still work. SDK got some updates, old versions aren't supported, ..
 eulerscheZahl: even ocean of code was broken before the contest
 digitalmaster: Hi men! Do you thinks it's possible to get some job offer requests on CG?
 eulerscheZahl: recruiters won't come to you just because you have a profile on CG
 eulerscheZahl: but some companies will give you a link to an online test on CG if you apply at them
 digitalmaster: oh I see, thanks for info
 xlr4829: i love CLASH OF CODE it's so amazing
 Gorbit99: it gets more stressful the higher you get
 SPDene: tell me about it... get one reverse you can't figure out, and takes another 10 wins to undo the damage
 Gorbit99: when I was 8th one time, I was getting 0.02 score per 1st place and -0.3 per 2nd place
 Gorbit99: one of those one step forward, all the steps back scenarios
 SPDene: Gorbit99 that one wouldn't have been fair if I just typed my answer, so giving it 5 minutes before i submit
 Gorbit99: yeah, it was kinda funny when I saw it
 SPDene: it only got approved this morning
 Gorbit99: tbf, before that I did one I just accepted a few days ago
 SPDene: yeah  - approved 38 mins ago
 Gorbit99: I'm waiting for the 3rd approval on mine so I can finally finsih that god damn quest line
 SPDene: the RPN one? that makes my head hurt!
 Gorbit99: it's not *that* bad, it's just new
 Gorbit99: lisp users appreciate it
 Gorbit99: if it gets approved, the next one will be the reverse of that, which is in fact painful
 SPDene: well, let's put it this way... I learnt RPN over 30 years ago... and never used it since!
 Gorbit99: I used it once, great for custom langs
 Goku999: add me to play together
 Gorbit99: gl
 Insufficient: geohot
 Insufficient: wrong chat sorry
 jacek: :O
 Gorbit99: this clash of code chat bug is annoying
 StepBack13: what bug?
 Gorbit99: coc chat goes away when you actually start it
 StepBack13: oh yeah, I thought that was just me, haha
 PraveenSreepada: same
 Q12: What for your opinion is the best language to code with in the shortest mode in coc?(I want to learn another language for the shortest mode in coc) 
 jacek: python, ruby, js. ruby seems to be shortest
 Washier: I second ruby
 Q12: Thanks
 Astrobytes: java
 jacek: kree java!
 Washier: hehe
 eulerscheZahl: C#
 Washier: hehe
 eulerscheZahl: what's the question?
 Astrobytes: shortest
 eulerscheZahl: bash
 jacek: html
 PraveenSreepada: Ruby is usually shortest but also weirdest
 eulerscheZahl: golfscriptbut that's not available on CG
 AntiSquid: is that like using hotkeys?
 PraveenSreepada: its like some symbol language
 Astrobytes: very strange to look at, never tried to use it
 Q12: What is CG?
 Washier: in golfscript the program "i" (just that) would read an integer n, and the the next n integers from console and store in list
 Washier: i thought we were imagining things. it exists?
 eulerscheZahl: CG = CodinGame
 AntiSquid: 0 chars - modify the environment itself and make it run from a different file the solution&#160;!!! 
 Washier: hehe
 Q12: Thank you eulerscheZahl
 Q12: What is mean that you have the symbol of CG next to your name?
 eulerscheZahl: hover over it
 AntiSquid: you are forced to live your life moderating CG chat
 eulerscheZahl: that's not the terms i agreed to
 Q12: :laughing: AntiSquid 
 jacek: that means he cant troll, so everything he says must be true
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/479880364">https://www.codingame.com/replay/479880364</a>I have a feeling this is suboptimal :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: but I also wonder if 200 turns is too short
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you promoted
 eulerscheZahl: good thing Astrobytes has his private league again
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 dbdr: and Illedan got pushed to W3
 Astrobytes: by jrke?
 Washier: damnit. now i have to play that too. cannot resist
 dbdr: by dwarfie
 Astrobytes: ah
 eulerscheZahl: there are some many games to play
 Washier: just got into breakthrough.
 dbdr: hm, made me think of a system where you could promote to various leagues
 dbdr: say wood2a and wood2b
 eulerscheZahl: what's the point of this?
 dbdr: not sure yet, just intriguing
 Astrobytes: meta leagues? Is this like you satying at level 42a, 42b etc?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *staying
 dbdr: probably inspiried by the quest map, where there are branches
 Astrobytes: Each wood league can have a cotton league, stone league and paper league
 dbdr: actually go would be good for it: you could improve your 9x9 skills, or improve on larger boards
 dbdr: it's orthogonal
 eulerscheZahl: Bob just made that 2 different games
 dbdr: yeah, but that's a kludge&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 JBM: anything's good to get xp
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: then create clashes
 JBM: with variants
 dbdr: I also read the is a "quantum go" variant, where stones are entangled
 JBM: so they're not so obvious in reverse mode
 JBM: ooooh shiny
 dbdr: MSmits would surely master that&#160;;)
 Washier: go looks awesome.  must ... do it
 Astrobytes: Sounds intriguing
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04751">https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04751</a>
 Astrobytes: Clever
 Washier: &lt;brain explodedes&gt;
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/479881490">https://www.codingame.com/replay/479881490</a>
 dbdr: this looks less like go than like Game of life :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Do you think Quantum Go would be too complicated for CG?
 dbdr: I don't pretend to master those rules, but I guess not
 dbdr: might be good to keep the board size small though
 Washier: was thinking now how you would bitboard 19x19
 Astrobytes: Yeah I imagine after actually playing a game or 3 it would be relatively easy to pick it up.There's a weak variant too.
 Astrobytes: And yeah, small board for sure
 dbdr: what about Many Worlds Quantum Go?&#160;;)
 dbdr: number of boards grows exponentially with the turn number
 Washier: &lt;exploeded pieces of brain recursively exploding&gt;
 PraveenSreepada: Schrodinger would definitely approve :joy:
 dbdr: is S a many worlds guy?
 dbdr: given CG's history of efficient implementation, sounds like a good idea
 dbdr: I guess the boards would soon become sub-pixel size
 jacek: ultimate quantum go?
 PraveenSreepada: or multidimensional...one can navigate across dimensions
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Washier: &lt;another recursive explosion&gt;
 dbdr: 2021: VR headset becomes required to view replays on CG
 Washier: 3d-UTTT
 Washier: 256x256x256
 Washier: well, (256 x 3)^3
 dbdr: qubitboard
 dbdr: oh, that's definitely for MSmits
 Astrobytes: lol indeed
 MSmits: playing dnd atm over google hangouts
 MSmits: did someone say uttt
 Astrobytes: nice
 Astrobytes: Just quantum board games
 PraveenSreepada: What is UTTT?
 MSmits: oh cool
 Astrobytes: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe PraveenSreepada
 PraveenSreepada: Oh

 Goku999: ai viet nam k
 Dr.Henry: Hello! Rank is every country or All?
 TyLuu: @Goku999 join #vn
 AntiSquid: weird those other language chats have very short history
 eulerscheZahl: the history is also truncated by time, not only messages
 eulerscheZahl: there's just so little activity. even happens on #De sometimes
 AntiSquid: #jp
 AntiSquid: empty
 eulerscheZahl: they have twitter
 jrke: is there any new update for fall challenge? like starting date etc.
 eulerscheZahl: no
 inoryy: #ru is never empty :rolling_eyes:
 AntiSquid: are there a lot of big protests in germany regarding covid?
 AntiSquid: i am not judging them, sweden had no real lockdown, just curious
 jacek: euler doesnt answer. that means he's on one
 AntiSquid: singing "shine bright like a diamond"
 eulerscheZahl: there are some protests. a few people complaining and begging for attention
 Marcose: nananana
 eulerscheZahl: mixing with right-wing groups. search "Attila Hildmann" for example
 eulerscheZahl: wikipedia: "Attila Klaus-Peter Hildmann is a German cookbook author, specializing in vegan recipes, and conspiracy theorist"
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even know his very german second name :D
 AntiSquid: hi Marcose
 AntiSquid: oh damn, i am really good at vegan recipes, i don't really want to be associated with that guy
 AntiSquid: attila sounds hungarian as a name, knew a few people with that name
 Marcose: Hi
 AntiSquid: mmm i see the issuebut then again don't like how casually they use the term conspiracy theory, i mean look up project sun-shine
 dbdr: yeah, language is imprecise
 AntiSquid: in other news Putin president for life lol
 jacek: again?
 AntiSquid: there was a referendum recently which extended the limit

 jacek: good for them
 ivandr: hi gusy I am new for this system
 ivandr: C++ is the best variant
 ivandr: as I understood
 ivandr: yes??
 Crazy296: no
 Crazy296: there's no such thing as a best variant
 Crazy296: but that is a good first language
 ivandr: and what about TLE
 ivandr: do you have any suggestions except C++ and Python (too slow)
 inoryy: rust, c#
 ivandr: hmm rust is approximately full analog of C++ but with high syntax defense and sugar, c# - cant see benefits
 ivandr: can you say 
 ivandr: benefits above C++
 R3Ked: If you need my opinion, I'm using C# because that's what Unity uses
 ivandr: understood - good idea
 ivandr: can anybody say some words about lua
 R3Ked: "Hop in, we're gonna find out who asked"
 R3Ked: oh whoops
 R3Ked: Wasn't insulting lua
 R3Ked: Roblox uses it, I think
 R3Ked: Make of that what you will
 R3Ked: Why does <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/horse-racing-duals">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/horse-racing-duals</a> come with syntax errors?
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: in which language?
 R3Ked: wait, they're gone
 jacek: oO
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: o.O
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: o,O
 AggYzz: lua is so nice
 AggYzz: but python is good too
 tomatoes: what nice in lua?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Can someone help me on the lucky number? Rn my solution involves looping through every number and testing it, but that doesn't work on the really big numbers
 ivandr: can you send a link

 Counterbalance: argh
 DevJ4Y: Ello
 ivandr: oh sorry
 eulerscheZahl: wrongly including/excluding the limits?
 Counterbalance: yeah, must be &lt; vs &lt;= 
 ivandr: sorry but can any bode say which time limits in lucky time
 eulerscheZahl: 1s
 ivandr: *lucky numbers
 ivandr: ggg
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Well I keep timing out
 ivandr: combinatorics in help
 Counterbalance: you can do it in &lt; 1ms
 ivandr: I think at list 15
 ivandr: ms
 Counterbalance: 0.07ms here
 ivandr: pretty strong servers
 eulerscheZahl: my C# won't be able to compete with you I suppose
 eulerscheZahl: VM warmup
 Counterbalance: without overhead i'm sure it'll be similar
 eulerscheZahl: seems hard to pass all tests and not be close to no time consumed
 Laminator: is it some formula
 Laminator: range don't work at all
 Laminator: using C doesn't help either

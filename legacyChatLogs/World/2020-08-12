 eulerscheZahl: please stop sending clash of code invites here.go to #clash
 eulerscheZahl: (i need a macro for this one...)
 LoganWick: How is this website made?

 aCat: hi euler
 aCat: can you provide an extension of your list of puzzles easy to language-achievement-spamming?
 eulerscheZahl: so you solved those i was suggesting?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-hungry-duck---part-2">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-hungry-duck---part-2</a>that has 2 parts solvable by the same code
 eulerscheZahl: same here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/x-egg-problem">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/x-egg-problem</a>
 eulerscheZahl: not directly easy to solve. but once you solved it, the code is easy enough to convert
 aCat: I had eggo problem solved in python2 so my code is locked ;p
 aCat: I spammed onboarding, rubik and A*craft :D
 aCat: and noted simple official easy CG puzzles as marslandr :D
 eulerscheZahl: while True: print("0 3\n0 4")
 aCat: yeah, I gave you upvote ;p
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 aCat: damn hungry duck I also have locked
 eulerscheZahl: why did you use a deprecated language? :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/rugby-score">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/rugby-score</a>
 aCat: cause it was not deprecated when I was doing them ;p
 eulerscheZahl: same game: i fail to find the list of best known scores you mentioned
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/eng/highscores/samegame/lx">http://www.js-games.de/eng/highscores/samegame/lx</a>
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10024.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10024.pdf</a> - this is probably one of the latest updates, but some more will appear at MCS 2020
 eulerscheZahl: wow. i'm at 48.8k on submit
 eulerscheZahl: and that's with doubled testcases
 Illedan: Mornin
 aCat: hello
 Illedan: I wonder how they decided on that 200 char limit for the Quest map, on Don't panic -.-
 eulerscheZahl: they took you-1
 eulerscheZahl: spoiler:exactly 200 is enough already
 eulerscheZahl: spoiler 2: you shouldn't use C# on this one
 eulerscheZahl: great, Thibaud is back
 Illedan: Yeah, I figured :P
 Illedan: But was wondering if it was possible without invoking a different language
 eulerscheZahl: in C#?
 Illedan: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr mentioned not doing any cheap tricks of that kind
 eulerscheZahl: has 176 in C#
 Illedan: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: me: 188 in python
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Illedan: xD
 dbdr: you can do &lt;200 in Java too
 Illedan: ...
 Illedan: oooh
 Illedan: I can use local functions in C# now
 Illedan: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: i wait until i don't have to declare a Main function anymore
 Illedan: ^^^
 eulerscheZahl: saw that as a draft, not sure if it will happen
 Illedan: CG should create their own wrapper
 dbdr: if the source file is "¤DP", the program will solve codingame.com's Don't Panic puzzle
 Illedan: Let me use NuGet in my CG projects and I'll push packages solving everything :evil:
 dbdr: too much overhead to import it
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: At 390 chars.. Going down slooowly -.-
 dbdr: &lt;200 is possible in C# and Java, but it's not especially easy
 dbdr: if that's your goal, a scripting language is probably a better idea
 eulerscheZahl: will it pass any testcase or just the ones provided?
 eulerscheZahl: my python assumes max 9 rows, other than that it should be always working
 dbdr: need to check&#160;:)
 dbdr: not any testcase
 dbdr: does your python work for the upper limit of every constraint under 100ms?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even remember what the constraints are
 dbdr:  1 ≤ nbFloors ≤ 15  5 ≤ width ≤ 100  10 ≤ nbRounds ≤ 200  0 ≤ exitFloor, elevatorFloor &lt; nbFloors  0 ≤ exitPos , elevatorPos &lt; width  -1 ≤ cloneFloor &lt; nbFloors  -1 ≤ clonePos &lt; width  2 ≤ nbTotalClones ≤ 50  0 ≤ nbElevators ≤ 100  Duration of one game turn: 100 ms 
 eulerscheZahl: but i did nothing fishy i wouldn't do in a non-golf puzzle
 dbdr: no need to be fishy if it's too slow
 eulerscheZahl: should be fine
 eulerscheZahl: that's part 1, while part 2 is the hard one CPU-wise
 eulerscheZahl: building new elevators
 dbdr: well, there could be cases that can be solvable with an optimal solution, not a greedy one
 dbdr: that should be intensive
 dbdr: optimal looks exponentially hard to me
 eulerscheZahl: are we talking about the same problem?
 dbdr: why not?
 eulerscheZahl: there's only 1 elevator per floor, you have to decide if you have to change direction to reach it
 dbdr: ah, didn't know about this constraint
 eulerscheZahl: a working solution will always be optimal as it's unique
 dbdr: wat?
 eulerscheZahl: there is only 1 solution
 dbdr: if you move a blocker by one, it can still be solution
 dbdr: so it's not unique
 eulerscheZahl: d'oh
 eulerscheZahl: forget the last thing i wrote
 eulerscheZahl: but still it's easy to find a shortest solution
 dbdr: it's possible a greedy solution can be unique with that constraint, yes
 eulerscheZahl: shortest path, not code
 dbdr: yes, minimal number of blockers, if you need to change directions
 eulerscheZahl: so: let's turn it into a harder community puzzle :P
 eulerscheZahl: Do panic
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: is there a version with multiple elevators per floor already?
 dbdr: I think a "PANIC" action would be cool
 dbdr: could replace BLOCK. when you panic, other clones turns away
 dbdr: just need a crazy animation
 dbdr: can we include a towel too?

 Marchete: struct closed his account?
 Marchete: yavalath is anonymous
 jacek: yavalath is older
 jrke: but  in othello its showing by struct
 jacek: yinsh still has struct as contributor
 eulerscheZahl: but where is struct himself?
 eulerscheZahl: missing for almost a month now
 jacek: so now he is destruct
 jrke: nope i think he is class
 jrke: what was the general rank of struct
 jrke:&#160;?
 Phenomz: which boss u guys at?
 jrke: boss??
 Phenomz: oh nvm i thought it was the chat for what we're currently doing 
 Phenomz: XD
 ditsche: if i join a clash i get alot of captchas, is there something i can do to get rid of them?
 SPDene: stop doing clashes for a while
 jrke: nope captchas are to prevent bot clashers so basically its for your goodness
 jacek: write bot to solve captchas :v
 jrke: Or do this ^ Oo
 eulerscheZahl: pay someone to solve captchas for you
 jacek: or invite mod to the clash
 Astrobytes: Or ban jacek
 jrke: or don't play clashes for few hours
 ditsche: ^ that's exactly what a bot would do
 jrke: yep
 SydM107: oh boy, I feel dumb I forgot that in C x^2 is x xor 2 not x*x 
 MSmits: hey, I have an interesting mcts issue
 MSmits: say you're using transpositions in mcts (which can be messy)
 MSmits: there is no particular reason not to use a node, that was meant to be used by player 1, by player 2 is there? If he is in the same state p1 was?
 MSmits: since the nodes gather statistics that tell you if that state is good or bad, it's true whether p1 is in that state or p2 is. The state being the full state of course, just mirrored
 MSmits: it's similar to using the same node in a symmetric state, only now it's symmetric between players
 MSmits: let me know if this sounds wrong to you :P
 jacek: so you want extend board inversion value to the transposition table
 MSmits: well it seems natural. If I am storing p1 and p2 the same way anyway, they can also share nodes 
 MSmits: it will be pretty rare that they are in the same state of course
 MSmits: but it saves me from having to store who's turn it is
 MSmits: i just store the player who's turn it is as the first board
 jacek: theoretically sounds good but it will occur rarely during actual game. but if its gonna help your particular implementation, why not.
 MSmits: hmm ok, cool. Transpositions seem good in breakthrough because the overhead from storing the states is small
 jacek: there are many transposition in breakthrough
 MSmits: I store when i expand and because 1 expansion adds so many children you dont do it as often as say, in oware
 MSmits: that too
 MSmits: my only problem is memory. At some point I run out of node pool and reset my node pool. By that time the transpositions become invalid because I may be overwriting series of children that the transposition map points to
 jacek: but im also thinking move grouping. many moves have practically the same score
 jacek: and thats not traposition
 MSmits: you mean doing this on expansion?
 MSmits: that's possible
 MSmits: it's basically pruning
 jacek: nah just thinking out loud
 MSmits: if 5 moves are equally good, only pick 1 as a possibility
 MSmits: I do this in some games. For example CSB
 MSmits: CSB has equivalent series of moves
 jacek: right
 MSmits: (turn left, then turn right is the same as not turning)
 jacek: the same goes for capture sequence on the same square
 jacek: with multiple captures
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: ohh crap, I forgot something
 MSmits: if i do this transposition player thing, I do have to switch the stored gamestate on the nodes as well, not just the keys in the transposition map :P
 MSmits: otherwise when reusing the node by the other player, it's gonna have all boardstates for its children reversed
 MSmits: more complicated than I thought
 AndreiHarsia: :grinning:
 jacek: good thing im so slow, no need for memory pool tricks
 MSmits: yeah it's annoying sometimes
 jacek: yes, its annoying being the best all the time
 jacek: oh, train accident in scotland
 MSmits: cant find anything about that?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, up Stonehaven way
 Astrobytes: (near Aberdeen)
 eulerscheZahl: new optim approved: same game
 MSmits: what optim?
 Astrobytes: Same Game
 jacek: the same?
 MSmits: ow lol
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl did that on purpose
 eulerscheZahl: but in this version of the game you have to play as bad as you can it seems
 jacek: so youre perfect
 MSmits: is this why you are at nr 1 euler?
 MSmits: :P
 eulerscheZahl: was 2nd <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tyd2v1">https://prnt.sc/tyd2v1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but now i'm at #1 in this game
 MSmits: confusing
 jacek: less is better?
 jacek: is it time?
 eulerscheZahl: i already informed aCat on discord that it's the wrong order
 jacek: who approved this
 MSmits: Approved by radekmie Zylo hoggi
 jacek: poland stronk
 eulerscheZahl: not me. I wanted more testcases. not twice the same
 jacek: but its same game
 eulerscheZahl: not same testcase
 Memo12334: anyone knows if there is a walkthrough for detective pikaptcha ep2?
 MSmits: mmh it's not really an adventure game, I don't think we have any walkthroughs :P
 Memo12334: would be my last easy challenge before I do other stuff on CG but I can't solve it
 MSmits: what are you stuck on?
 Memo12334: I just don't know what to do with the directions and which wall to follow
 MSmits: i<i>ll see what i did for ep 2</i>
 Memo12334: I don't understand the probelm completely at all
 MSmits: pikaptcha walks along a wall and you have to count how many times he steps on a cell
 MSmits: sometimes he follows right wall, sometimes left
 MSmits: depends on the input
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm#Wall_follower">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm#Wall_follower</a>
 RoboStac: but stop when you get back to the start again instead of an exit
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/481439920">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/481439920</a>maybe a replay helps to explain the idea
 Memo12334: I only get one wall input for every test case right
 eulerscheZahl: you get the full map
 MSmits: Memo12334 it's not a turnbased thingy. You get the full map and have to predict the full future
 MSmits: so you dont get new input that tells you pikaptchas new surroundings on anything. You have to simulate that all on your own
 Memo12334: ty , im going to read the wikipedia page from RoboStac and try to solve it
 MSmits: I would not say this is an easy puzzle btw, it's more like medium
 MSmits: it's easy if you're used to making simulations in games, which you do in bot games all the time, but if you've just been doing easy puzzles, it's not 
 MSmits: good practice though
 Memo12334: yes I like these kind of puzzles where I have to resereach algorithms that I can use.
 Memo12334: 0 exp tho
 Astrobytes: lol, what an awesome bug that is (the same game one)
 MSmits: I thought you get some xp for the community puzzles?
 Memo12334: oh not that exp
 Astrobytes: There's XP and CP
 eulerscheZahl: he has no personal experience on that field, regardless of what CG gives credits for
 Memo12334: exactly
 MSmits: ahh
 Astrobytes: Oh I see
 Astrobytes: We're so CG-ified
 Astrobytes: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes that score looks like always finding the largest group on Same Game, isn't it?
 MSmits: beamsearch seems great here
 eulerscheZahl: I might go with Chokudai
 MSmits: dont remember what that was exactly
 Astrobytes: Hm, possible
 eulerscheZahl: similar to beam. but extending the size instead of depth
 eulerscheZahl: size = width
 MSmits: like best first search?
 Astrobytes: I was thinking to try Cegimax with Prune Array, personally
 eulerscheZahl: yeah MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: where's ceg himself?
 Astrobytes: NRPA seems pretty good too, was reading some paper the other day 
 eulerscheZahl: acat linked that paper
 Astrobytes: He was around the other day, back from whatever was keeping him busy
 Astrobytes: Yeah that one
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nrpa.org/">https://www.nrpa.org/</a>
 Astrobytes: There're some others too

 eulerscheZahl: that's a troll link MSmits
 MSmits: ah so thats just mcts
 MSmits: I know :P
 MSmits: the link is meant to say: huh&#160;?
 MSmits: I guess mcts works fine here
 jacek: and your favourite variant: meta (nested) mcts
 MSmits: do you mean people will run this offline?
 MSmits: validators will be public/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 jacek: i meant online meta mcts
 jacek: at some puzzle games its better than pure mcts
 jacek: even in real time
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: interesting
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/nested.pdf">https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/nested.pdf</a>
 MSmits: hmm this seems similar to just running multiple random rollouts during selection and expansion
 darkhorse64: Last at SameGame with the best score&#160;? Is that the misère version&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes MSmits: validators are public.and it's 20 testcases, each appearing twice
 eulerscheZahl: i have a 48.806 score for the protocol
 eulerscheZahl: and I DMed aCat
 darkhorse64: OK. Scores are wrong then&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just the config.ini where you have to replace an ascending by descending
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Bender4/blob/master/config/config.ini#L4">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Bender4/blob/master/config/config.ini#L4</a>linking to my own game as aCat didn't link a github for his. same principle
 darkhorse64: Makes sense
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl do you mean that the  10 testcases that we see, appear twice as validators?
 MSmits: or are the validators different? If so, where are they?
 MSmits: ohh I see it
 MSmits: they are the same as the human playable game linked in the description
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/eng/games/samegame/lx/play">http://www.js-games.de/eng/games/samegame/lx/play</a>you can select a game here
 eulerscheZahl: "presetting"
 MSmits: sorry, i should have figured it out 3 seconds earlier :P
 eulerscheZahl: 20 games. each appears twice as a validator
 MSmits: silly
 eulerscheZahl: while I tried to argue against it, someone else game the 3rd approval vote&#160;:/
 MSmits: whats the reason for it?
 MSmits: that it needs arguing?
 eulerscheZahl: these 20 testcases are "common tests"
 eulerscheZahl: so you can find scores for them on papers
 MSmits: right
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted 20 random tests in addition. but that would make it harder to compare scores with papers
 eulerscheZahl: at least for the global leaderboard
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: so the random tests are in there, but they are the same as the original
 eulerscheZahl: one could still make each individual testcase publicly playable in the IDE in addition to submit validator
 MSmits: right
 eulerscheZahl: there are no random tests
 MSmits: but why do they appear twice then? 
 eulerscheZahl: just the common testsets again with different colors (swap green with red or whatever)
 MSmits: whats the point of that?
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I was arguing about
 eulerscheZahl: my point: you still only have to hardcode 20 testcases if you play offline. and same score for deterministic solver
 MSmits: I can define my bot to define colors as when they first appear 
 eulerscheZahl: aCat: but different for random solver when running online
 MSmits: which means its immune to any change in color setting
 eulerscheZahl: and then deus ex machina: 3rd approval vote
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: If only there was some kind of "Pause Contribution" feature, pending further discussion
 MSmits: it would not be different with random solver
 Astrobytes: Without having to revert back to WIP etc
 MSmits: if you define colors the way i just explained
 MSmits: if the first color that appears is always red, even if the game defines it as blue, then colors will be the same
 MSmits: or wait, do the points also differ?
 MSmits: by color i mean?
 eulerscheZahl: random search count yield different results when getting a different seed or about of simulations
 MSmits: oh right, the time thingy
 eulerscheZahl: it's exactly the same testcase again if you substitute the colors
 MSmits: right, seems silly
 eulerscheZahl: my point!
 eulerscheZahl: i was more diplomatic
 MSmits: silly is pretty diplomatic here I think
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: well it looks like I have an excuse to write another meta mcts 
 eulerscheZahl: oh no!
 jacek: meta metamcts?
 MSmits: currently running oware and breakthrough, but noone seems to be resubmitting breakthrough
 MSmits: so i can switch it out
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: i mean othello
 MSmits: not breakthrough lol
 MSmits: dont have that (yet)
 jacek: there are 2 common breakthrough openings
 eulerscheZahl: how much CPU time do you spend on these games on average?
 MSmits: i saw it yeah
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl hmm 2 cores, 12 hrs a day or so 
 jacek: yet my bot prefers the mix of the two o.O
 MSmits: havent paid too much attention to it, i saw its usually taking a pawn from the edge?
 jacek: yes, and make row hole in the middle
 wlesavo: it would actually even be an ok multi
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: wlesavo	you mean taking turns picking a cell?
 wlesavo: yeah
 MSmits: interesting
 wlesavo: with mirrored games
 eulerscheZahl: mirrored, yeah...
 MSmits: or just randomized maps
 eulerscheZahl: well, might even be doable. i think i saw something like that in the SDK
 MSmits: like bandas
 eulerscheZahl: and it should be possible to replace parts of it to allow swapping
 wlesavo: well yeah, maybe mirror is not a requirement
 MSmits: you can also do some tests and figure out p1 advantage and just give p2 a bonus
 MSmits: or do pie rule, even better
 MSmits: well my TT version of breakthrough is worse&#160;:(
 MSmits: no crashing, works fine, but just ranks lower, no idea why
 MSmits: only game where i was able to make it work to use TT in mcts is yavalath so far, even then it was questionable whether it was actually better
 wlesavo: map generation should be reliable for multi though, pure random would be bad in general, because of the maps with only a few moves, which would be decided in a few turns
 MSmits: true, not sure how likely that would be with this game
 MSmits: you might also just use 1 basic map
 MSmits: if it's a good one
 MSmits: like boardgames do
 MSmits: but then you risk people writing opening books of course
 wlesavo: you can fill some parts of the map by tetris-like shapes and the other parts by random or smth like that 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: bandas was improved also, when it was pure random it would give bad maps sometimes
 MSmits: and maps are still pretty bad sometimes
 field3: breakthrough algorithm to remember.If there are three pieces facing each other, raise the middle.:relaxed:
 darkhorse64: Same for chess. It's been a known combination for one century
 darkhorse64: Re samegame. I think known validators really spoil the fun (making it with severe time and space constraints)
 MSmits: hmm not sure, it's possible that a better algorithm might be a million times more important than more computation time
 MSmits: these guys describe something like that:

 Hjax: isnt thinking twice as long only worth like, 10 elo to stockfish? 
 MSmits: i think it depends a lot on the domain,
 MSmits: we saw this in numbershifting also. 
 MSmits: many different possible algorithms and they all got stuck at some level, the levels varied dramatically
 darkhorse64: New challenge: beat other algos within 30s running time 
 MSmits: kinda hard to enforce
 MSmits: the annoying thing with trying to keep validators secret is that you always risk them being reverse engineered
 MSmits: for the validators I can do: If cell x == green on first turn, break and check which validator fails
 MSmits: just submit a few 100 times
 MSmits: and i got them
 Hjax: i considered doing that for one of the code golf games
 Hjax: but then decided it wasnt worth the effort
 MSmits: sure, but they should have enough testcases that even if they are known, you'd need too many characters to hardcode them
 MSmits: if that's not the case, then it's a bad code golf
 MSmits: you cant do that for optimization games
 MSmits: no matter what you do, there's ways to reverse the opening gamestate
 MSmits: even continuous games. You can do things like if "first digit of x position of  first creature == 5" 
 MSmits: but could be a lot of work yeah
 jacek: you just want to book a solo game

 AllYourPellets: is rust code compiled with --release flag?
 AllYourPellets: i'm seeing different performance numbers in ide vs submitted code
 jacek: its debug in ide
 jacek: thats why i cant test against dbdr in breakthrough :f
 AllYourPellets: its weird because i lose a game on the leaderboard, copy it to the ide and then win it... im seeing better performance in ide
 jacek: huh? it should be release in leaderboard and debug in ide
 AllYourPellets: oh wait there was an extra number
 AllYourPellets: nvm
 Hjax: yeah rust in ide is painful 
 Hjax: i hope they fix it, makes testing a huge pain
 Hjax: no one can test against me, but i cant test against anyone
 AllYourPellets: hmm anyone have any ideas how i lose in release mode because of timeout but then win in ide test?
 Hjax: infinite loop if you run too long maybe?
 Hjax: or some weird slowdown from running too long
 jacek: is it really timeout or crash
 Hjax: ^ good point 
 AllYourPellets: it says time limit exceeded
 AllYourPellets: theres no crash info in the output
 AllYourPellets: how can i tell?
 jacek: then maybe it is really timeout
 jacek: most games say timeout in any ocassion
 Hjax: if you can, try to replicate the game locally 
 Hjax: and see what happens 
 Hjax: ill upload a dummy bot that prints its IO to stderr
 Hjax: and then copy paste to my local bot 
 Hjax: and step through with a debugger
 AllYourPellets: good idea
 AllYourPellets: hmm is there a way to tell how much memory you are using?
 AllYourPellets: maybe im hitting the memory limit
 jacek: its 768MB
 AllYourPellets: yeah on my local machine im surpassing that, that's gotta be it
 cheeze2000: :flag_pt:
 Hjax: seems like a reasonable explanation 
 Hjax: cheeze2000 nice toko profile pic
 cheeze2000: ty
 JaggBow: hello everyone, I hope you're well. For some reason CoC gives me 75% success rate after htting send when I have already check all testcases and they're all correct, someone had this issue before?
 jacek: there are more testcases after submit
 jacek: so you cant hardcode the solution
 Hjax: yeah the test cases in the IDE and the validators when you submit are different 
 JaggBow: Ah okay didn't know that, thanks&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Hey, how come my Same Game score didn't update? It's stuck at 8860, when I got 10018
 eulerscheZahl: uno reverse card
 eulerscheZahl: you have to get a lower score, check the order on the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Oh right, right. I misunderstood the earlier bug
 <b>**eulerscheZahl didn't approve it :P</b>
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: I'm blaming Radek, just because.
 wlesavo: am i stupid or SG grid is a little messed up
 Astrobytes: 0,0 is in bottom left
 eulerscheZahl: is that a puzzle or a real world question?
 wlesavo: we get a rows in a reverse order?
 eulerscheZahl: i also complained about the placement of the origin, see contributions comments :P
 wlesavo: i mean this origin would be ok if we would get the grid starting from origin
 MSmits: the bottom row is 0 because that is where the horizontal contraction happens
 MSmits: I guess it made more sense to acat that a special row is 0
 jacek: so catty of him
 MSmits: I'm ok with that part, but the duplicated validators are silly
 eulerscheZahl: small detail. I did it wrong when parsing the input at first. but fixed now to never look back
 735487: eulerscheZahl: uno reverse card, is there uno game on CG? played this game few times with my child when bought it to him
 eulerscheZahl: no uno here :D
 eulerscheZahl: there was another card game pending for a while
 735487: do you know the rules good?
 eulerscheZahl: guinote or however it's spelled
 eulerscheZahl: i played uno as a kid too
 eulerscheZahl: with an extra rule made up by my parents as i later discovered
 Astrobytes: Maybe aCat will do it as part of his series
 eulerscheZahl: there was this advertising card just having the uno logo on both sides
 wlesavo: damn, im trying to get closer to euler but it seems that you have to really dedicate to geting a lower score to achieve that
 735487: it is not clear for me how the black cards may be break. only with reverse cards or with black cards too
 eulerscheZahl: my parents just included it into the game. you could play it followed by 2 cards of the same color
 wlesavo: best results from random choices
 eulerscheZahl: i do depth 2 bruteforce
 MSmits: lol 
 wlesavo: oh i see, you do search for lower
 wlesavo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: lol to depth 2 or the uno card?
 MSmits: that people are trying to beat you at a lower score because the leaderboard is bugged :P
 dbdr: gamification at its best
 eulerscheZahl: my highest is 48806
 735487: i bought uno almost without rules at all. so i tried to find the rules but some points still not clear for me. so we played our rules ))
 MSmits: wait it stores the lowest?
 MSmits: i thought it just ordered the board wrong
 Astrobytes: No, I just found that out too MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: that's connected to each other
 735487: keep best results i think
 eulerscheZahl: related is a better word i think
 Astrobytes: I misunderstood earlier
 MSmits: related yeah
 eulerscheZahl: some cat wrote the config.ini file wrong
 eulerscheZahl: it always get confused as well. so i look at an existing optim and check that config file + leaderboard sorting
 wlesavo: some cat in some game wrote something in some config file wrong
 eulerscheZahl: then: "i want the same" or "do the opposite"
 735487: oh sorry guys. completely dont undestand what is going on here&#160;:) will do some work. see you
 MSmits: good luck with SomeWork&#160;!
 wlesavo: lol
 Astrobytes: amurushkin: new optimisation game, "Same Game"
 735487: thanks 
 Astrobytes: It has a bug currently
 Astrobytes: It takes lowest score as best&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: a feature
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 wlesavo: yeah, gl beating eulers score
 735487: sound easy to be fixed
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I guess aCat will fix as soon as he can
 eulerscheZahl: change 1 line in the config and reupload
 MSmits: i am guessing this game was in WIP too short to test the leaderboard properly?&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: there is no way to test the leaderboard during WIP
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: mmh i thought contributions had leaderboards?
 MSmits: wait i mean in the approval stage i guess
 MSmits: wip is before approval right?
 Astrobytes: haha beat that wlesavo!
 MSmits: Astrobytes are you doing any floodfill?
 dbdr: looks like multis have leaderboards but not optims
 MSmits: never done a floodfill in C++ yet that wasn't a bitboard
 Astrobytes: Yeah MSmits
 Astrobytes: Bitboard it then :P
 wlesavo: damn, you beat my random choice Astrobytes, are you up to smth?
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: mmh so visited cells are a bitboard and use integers for cell indices as a queue?
 MSmits: I can steal code from my playground 
 dbdr: but that's stealing!
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Ah I forgot about that playground
 dbdr: (IT crowd reference)
 MSmits: it's in C#, but it doesnt do anything thats not easily done in C++
 MSmits: probably the shifting of the board after a move is a bit complicated
 MSmits: who reused their smash the code bot just now?
 eulerscheZahl: not yet. but the dropping logic is slightly more optimized for STC than for same game so far
 eulerscheZahl: more so when it comes to chain reactions that we don't have here
 MSmits: do you use any tricky stuff to make the dropping fast for STC?
 eulerscheZahl: not really tricky
 eulerscheZahl: more like stupid for same game (SG from now on)
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: dropping by 1 cell each time
 eulerscheZahl: in a loop
 MSmits: hey, if there is another game with SG as initials, will you call this one SG-1?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: What if the other is called Stargate tho
 MSmits: that'd be funny
 MSmits: gonna start be defining my own colors so that it does the same moves on thos e colorflipped validators :P
 MSmits: by
 MSmits: int colorMap[5];
 eulerscheZahl: cells[0][0] has value 0next different is substituted to 1 and so on
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: it's really easy to do
 eulerscheZahl: soon: all top scores are even numbers
 MSmits: yeah!
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse the only odd guy atm
 MSmits: which is odd, because I don't think of him as odd at all
 aCat: eulerscheZahl thanks for the info
 aCat: what it should look like
 aCat: sorting_order=desc
 aCat:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you are about to break the leaderboard :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 aCat: yeah, didn't think of this&#160;;(
 aCat: silly cat
 Astrobytes: great bug tho :D
 eulerscheZahl: if you delete the config file, the SDK will even prompt you to define the sorting order
 eulerscheZahl: or was it removing that one line? i forgot
 dbdr: CGP Grey using a wrong quote in a video explaining how he was wrong about something else :D
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic:&#160;;]
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: auch, other window ^^'
 Astrobytes: ban!
 MSmits:&#160;;]
 MSmits: wait is this acat?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: alt accounts are forbidden
 MSmits: oww
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: This is technical account&#160;;]
 eulerscheZahl: then you shall not chat!
 AntiSquid: euler is my alt
 eulerscheZahl: i'm tempted to kick
 MSmits: my color map works
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/196ecf85-9661-482e-af55-9ed3bf55d45d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/196ecf85-9661-482e-af55-9ed3bf55d45d</a>
 AntiSquid: someone delete my alt please
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: I already submitted testcode to SameGame
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: so you can kick :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 aCat: au
 aCat: that hurts
 aCat: bad frog
 aCat: ^^'
 eulerscheZahl: F5 and you are backban = only back after chat server restart
 eulerscheZahl: i miss an option between
 eulerscheZahl: ban for 30min or so
 AntiSquid: if chat gets restart all bans are undone?
 aCat: yeah seems reasonable to have some time-based silence spell
 eulerscheZahl: yes, bans aren't stored permanently
 AntiSquid: i don't understand percentage in SameGame
 Astrobytes: Mod spells would be awesome. Temporarily remove CP/XP, invisibility etc
 AntiSquid: why am i at 0%&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: aCat explain
 eulerscheZahl: invalid or no move
 AntiSquid: but someone is at 35% 
 eulerscheZahl: you have to remove all groups of size 2+
 AntiSquid: also i have more points so i clearly pass some cases?
 aCat: yeah, rules changed as it was stupid to allow everything as you can increase your timer in such case
 eulerscheZahl: you hit some groups and then fail to print a valid action
 eulerscheZahl: we will solve it offline and hardcode anyways
 eulerscheZahl: always the same problem for optim games
 aCat: flat mc gives 38 k
 MSmits: i dont mind really, I've yet to run up against someone that rented thousands of dollars worth of amazon/google hardware
 eulerscheZahl: back to top&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: top of what?
 eulerscheZahl: SG
 Astrobytes: the SG lb
 AntiSquid: ah it updates slowly
 MSmits: who was it that was top at numbershifting on an old laptop&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: westicles
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: thats fine with me
 AntiSquid: dbdr can't beat D high performance i see
 eulerscheZahl: he's first again
 eulerscheZahl: about 150 levels above dbdr
 MSmits: cool
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if he ever got the submit script running
 MSmits: does he do anything else on CG this well?
 eulerscheZahl: played some game of drones
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: top10 range i think
 eulerscheZahl: definitely a player who can do better when trying
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I think we have lots of those
 MSmits: that just do 1 or 2 multis/optims but could be top 10 in all of them if they tried to
 MSmits: you see them come out on contests
 eulerscheZahl: even then not all of them try in the same contest
 dbdr: MSmits: I would say it was me, not w
 MSmits: were you the one with the old laptop?
 MSmits: maybe you both had one
 MSmits: maybe I should get one
 dbdr: it's relatively old and slow yes
 eulerscheZahl: i think westicles had even worse hardware
 dbdr: and my algo is faster
 eulerscheZahl: but not sure anymore
 dbdr: possible
 MSmits: dbdr you mean he just keeps it running for longer?
 eulerscheZahl: let's do a fund raising. new laptop for dbdr
 MSmits: to beat you?
 dbdr: slow hardware is good, it encourages you to optimize more&#160;:)
 jacek: man 80s and 90s code is an art
 AntiSquid: you wait more for things to load up
 eulerscheZahl: pixi is a pain
 eulerscheZahl: even that 3D teapot was less resource intensive
 dbdr: once he ran for a long time without submitting, and I caught up pretty quickly because my implementation is faster
 dbdr: now he did it again, after even more time
 MSmits: 3d teapot?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/52965be9af1e1e9f5b35487a3cc449f24bf2</a>
 Astrobytes: In Contributions MSmits
 jacek: darkhorse512?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse360
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse180you can't even do a full rotation for 1 axis
 MSmits: runs very well eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: meh
 Astrobytes: yeah, cool innit 
 MSmits: yeah its great
 jacek: ignit
 MSmits: now make 3D chess
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: why me?
 MSmits: you made the pot
 eulerscheZahl: i did my job, the next is your turn
 eulerscheZahl: i imported the pot
 eulerscheZahl: copy-paste ftw
 Astrobytes: import chess pieces then
 Astrobytes: copy-paste ftw
 Astrobytes: Get JBM to do textures for you
 eulerscheZahl: craftpix even has some 3D stuff
 MSmits: oh it's webgl
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://craftpix.net/freebies/filter/3d-game-assets/">https://craftpix.net/freebies/filter/3d-game-assets/</a>
 MSmits: you know, eulerscheZahl, you can code stuff in unity and it can compile to webgl
 MSmits: so you can do this in C#&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: get a 3D scanning app
 eulerscheZahl: i think you can use any language if you manage to tell maven how to compile it
 eulerscheZahl: the pom.xml is the entry point
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: hmm, this runs on GPU right
 MSmits: so some people that open your contribution will not be happy :P
 eulerscheZahl: i think it can do both depending on your hardware
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: i remember emh doing something in webGL that was a pain for my poor computer
 eulerscheZahl: and inoryy calling my out for having a "potato GPU"
 Astrobytes: Not that NSFW CSB thingy
 eulerscheZahl: don't remind me :scream:
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah. I'm still scarred.
 Astrobytes: Scarred for life in fact.
 MSmits: rofl
 MSmits: sometimes it's good to work from home
 inoryy: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: What is your "potato GPU"?
 eulerscheZahl: geforce gtx 570
 Astrobytes: Wow, I thought I was behind with my GTX 660
 MSmits: test it here eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/white-potato-b883eab7d2a54c9b974d55373429c24b">https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/white-potato-b883eab7d2a54c9b974d55373429c24b</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: works fine
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i feel insulted now
 MSmits: potato gpu then
 Astrobytes: ...
 Astrobytes: If yours is a potato, what's mine?
 MSmits: try this Astrobytes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tortilla-chip-ac945048744f4027b1376b13283a93f5">https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tortilla-chip-ac945048744f4027b1376b13283a93f5</a>
 Astrobytes: A tortilla chip?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it's easier to render
 MSmits: cuz it's flat
 Astrobytes: easier to render than what?
 eulerscheZahl: like the earth?
 MSmits: a potato
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: The potato rendered fine?
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i thought you meant your computer is worse
 MSmits: so i sought out a lesser challenge
 Astrobytes: euler has the potato GPU, he's got a 570 I have a 660
 MSmits: ahhhh
 eulerscheZahl: and 660 &gt; 570
 inoryy: a fried potato
 Astrobytes: That implies it's borken with the 'fried' part though
 Astrobytes: Or broken
 eulerscheZahl: back in 2011 it was on the higher end
 inoryy: I think the pc I ended up having to throw out during the move had a 7xx card and nobody wanted it...
 Astrobytes: Meh. Don't need fancy GPUs for Zachtronics games anyway
 MSmits: got GTX 1060 myself, but I've had this for like 3 years 
 MSmits: so it's not exactly new
 eulerscheZahl: in my first semester I had a really old PC. like struggling on a 10 page google document with formulas
 MSmits: I used to be a gamer, CG ruined that
 eulerscheZahl: 1GB RAMthrew that away
 Astrobytes: I upgrade every decade
 eulerscheZahl: 2.4GHz single core
 MSmits: I used to upgrade gpu every 2 years, everything else 4 years
 Astrobytes: actually, I upgraded 3 times last decade
 inoryy: I think the pc I have now is the last "big" one, if I ever buy a new one it will be a NUC
 eulerscheZahl: i upgraded my SSD. rest is still from 2011 when I bought it
 MSmits: I need to get a threadripper to meta mcts 10 games at once and save money on heating
 inoryy: well by "I have" I mean my wife has and sometimes lets me play on it...
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: really inoryy? Why does your wife have the strongest machine?
 MSmits: mine has a relatively good laptop, but that's about it
 jacek: so she can train NN
 inoryy: she's a graphical illustrator, needs a lot of RAM and a beefy-ish CPU
 MSmits: makes sense
 inoryy: the GPUs are a waste now but meh
 Astrobytes: Yep, that would figure
 MSmits: why are they a waste?
 MSmits: no animations?
 inoryy: yeah, neither 3D
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: when I started coding it was all 3D physics stuff
 dbdr: MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYQ2Z9gU8AA3_Vt?format=jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYQ2Z9gU8AA3_Vt?format=jpg</a>
 MSmits: that's average
 MSmits: I doubt thats true for mine :P
 MSmits: getting a lot of mileage out of it
 dbdr: to some degree
 dbdr: it's still an order of magnitude difference
 MSmits: most people hardly use their cpu and mostly gamers use their gpu a lot
 MSmits: that's why those botnets are so effective
 MSmits: it's not being used anyway...
 MSmits: didn't they have a botnet of traffic cams somewhere?
 inoryy: "17in monitor" -- something tells me that's not the newest data out there..
 MSmits: yeah I could not get a 17 inch one when i wanted to 
 MSmits: it was all 20+
 dbdr: I still doubt it's a good idea to buy new hardware because usage is more efficient
 MSmits: yeah unless your hardware is really really old and doesnt have much life left in it
 dbdr: inoryy: you can search for other data, but I doubt it will reverse the results
 dbdr: it's mostly driven by physical processes
 dbdr: MSmits: how much did the laws of physics change recently?&#160;;)
 MSmits: been out of the loop
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: this is good to know because it's non obvious. we get the stuff in the shop and have no idea how it was produced and how much energy was needed for it
 dbdr: while we do see the small part of energy usage at home
 Uljahn: so green energy is not so green
 inoryy: tbh I'm not even sure what's the argument in the first place -- are you thinking of global carbon offset?
 MSmits: I imagine the price of the energy is negligible compared to the price of the machine
 dbdr: I think I misread MSmits, thought you said you would save on energy bill :D
 MSmits: nope, heating
 dbdr: but you won't save on heating either :D
 MSmits: energy bill will go through the roof
 MSmits: so will most of the energy
 MSmits: sure i will
 MSmits: my heating bill = gas
 MSmits: I will use a lot less gas
 MSmits: instead using electricity to heat my house
 dbdr: and more electricity
 MSmits: through mcts
 dbdr: and electricity is more expensive than gas per watt, isn't it?
 MSmits: definitely
 Astrobytes: Mass Consumption Tree Search
 MSmits: otherwise we would all use electric heaters
 Scarfield: but still saving money on heating, if you isolate that calc :p
 MSmits: yes, and I am
 inoryy: alright but then again I don't get the argument. it's like saying don't replace your V12 from the 70s with a modern hybrid because think of the energy used to produce it?
 dbdr: reminds me of someone who did not turn off their gas cooker because they could not afford to buy matches&#160;;)
 MSmits: inoryy it wasn't even an argument because dbdr decided to misunderstand my poor excuse of a joke :P
 dbdr: actually france pushed for electric heating at some period, because the nuclear reactors were underused
 Astrobytes: Don't spoil it MSmits, this is CG chat, we can make an argument out of anything! :P
 MSmits: true true
 MSmits: i'd say underused is better than overused when it comes to nuclear reactors
 dbdr: and then metaarguments
 Astrobytes: (I mean that affectionately btw)
 inoryy: no I get that, I'm just going with the misread version and trying to get where the argument comes from
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, I tend to agree there
 MSmits: ahh, well some people argue that you should replace somewhat older machines with newer ones to save money
 dbdr: sometime people argument to buy new equipement because it is a bit more efficient than the old, still functional one
 dbdr: ignoring the inefficiency of producing new equipement
 MSmits: meh, I think I said it better
 MSmits: :P
 dbdr: you're much better obviously
 dbdr:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: As to whether it's efficient depends on your application of the equipment I guess
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 dbdr: yes, it's something you can calculate
 dbdr: but many decisions are irrational or forget some aspect
 MSmits: Astrobytes, the more you use it, the more it would help to replace it, but I doubt there are many instances where the new machine is that much more efficient that it's worth the cost of replacing it earlier
 Astrobytes: I mean it's true a lot of people upgrade things (not just computing hardware) just because "bigger, better, FASTER MOAR" mentality
 dbdr: yes, consumption addiction
 MSmits: the efficiency argument is just a crutch to get that other stuff you just mentioned
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, that's what I'm getting at. If you're gonna be running the hardware to it's full potential the tradeoff is sound
 dbdr: not necessarily
 MSmits: my point is that it might not even be sound then
 MSmits: it might be better to run the old hardware into the ground first
 dbdr: you need to do the math. you might need to use it at 500% of max capacity for it to start to make sense
 Scarfield: development cost, production cost, transport, etc
 MSmits: I calculated it for a TV once, one of those old tube TV's
 MSmits: replacing it for a flatscreen
 Astrobytes: Hm, yes I'll take that. I'm including industrial equipment here though
 MSmits: didnt even come near being better to replace
 MSmits: i mean that thing has a particle accelerator in it
 MSmits: and it wasnt worth replacing 
 Astrobytes: hehe
 dbdr: another fun calculation: in most cases, cars are in average slower than bikes, once you count how much time you need to work to pay for them
 MSmits: I believe that
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Cars are overrated.
 MSmits: I never learned to drive because I would need to almost work an extra day just to pay for it
 dbdr: nice
 Astrobytes: I never had to learn to drive, and hopefully don't have to
 Astrobytes: Always used public transport, my bicycle and my legs
 dbdr: I have the license but never owned a car either&#160;:)
 MSmits: I mean we are one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a great public transport system, why are people even considering cars if they dont need them
 dbdr: brainwashing
 dbdr: it's not rational in most cases
 inoryy: dbdr why would you calculate it this way? typically your work hours are limited, as are your off-work hours. you either shave off 1+ hour on commute or you don't
 MSmits: inoryy basically he counts driving as working
 Scarfield: freedom and saving time
 Astrobytes: London is like that (most cities I suppose). No need whatsoever to drive for *most* people. And try parking.
 dbdr: don't buy a car, work 1 less hour per day
 MSmits: I do too, I can't drive in the car and spam you guys on CG, but I can in a train
 inoryy: but you can't in most cases
 dbdr: or take unpaid leave sometime and enjoy life
 inoryy: you work your work hours the same, that's my point
 inoryy: the 1+ hour commute /day will be on top
 dbdr: or time between jobs
 MSmits: inoryy it depends on the country I think. I only work 4 days a week
 dbdr: there are many options
 MSmits: I could not afford this with a car
 inoryy: I mean sure it depends on the country
 Astrobytes: Yeah, work/life balance really needs to be addressed globally. Might be some other issues to solve first but that might help in the long run.
 MSmits: also it gets even worse when people go to fitness studios when they could use their commute to fitness
 dbdr: sometimes you can also decide to rent/buy closer to your job with the money saved
 Astrobytes: Not in London mate :D
 MSmits: I walk 1 hr a day as part of my commute
 MSmits: when i work that is
 MSmits: thats not wasted time in the way that driving would be
 inoryy: to clarify the car culture is mostly a thing in US, and in US I don't think you have that freedom of choice you're speaking of
 dbdr: I know london prices are crazy
 MSmits: inoryy car culture is here too, but you're right in the US distances are longer and the public transport is worse
 dbdr: in the US, depends where. some cities are dense
 Scarfield: im not sure how many complanies are willing to take on someone for a 4 day week, when others are willing to do 5 days. but i like the idea. 
 dbdr: in NY I think most people don't use their cars
 MSmits: depends a lot on the line of work i suppose
 MSmits: in my line of work most of my colleagues are parttimers
 Scarfield: but that so many people (myself included) has a 0.5-1ton machine for transport doesnt make sense
 MSmits: fulltimers are a dying breed
 MSmits: hopefully not literally... I am dreading where this is going next week
 Astrobytes: In the UK we work you into the ground so that hopefully nobody has to pay out your pension.
 inoryy: the point is that if a person in US does ends up buying a car for commute it's not like he's dumb dumb and doesn't realize he could just work 35 hours / week or take unpaid leave or whatever and ride a bike instead, almost no company would take that deal lol
 Scarfield: ^
 dbdr: you can take time off between jobs too
 MSmits: inoryy maybe not a software company
 MSmits: schools, hospitals etc, will do it just fine
 Astrobytes: In the US?
 Scarfield: not as an engineer either in my exp
 MSmits: not sure about US
 Astrobytes: He was talking about US&#160;:)
 MSmits: here coders will work full time also, I guess that's expected of them
 MSmits: my friends that are coders do work full time anyway
 dbdr: you can also do consulting and chose your pace
 inoryy: you can also not work, that's an option
 dbdr: yes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Not a good option anywhere other than France lol
 Scarfield: many places its kind of frowned upon to not work more than the minimum hrs, but it seems thats about to change. Have heard about more companies trying shorter work weeks in DK at least
 Scarfield: especially during the lockdown
 MSmits: shorter work weeks are great at reducing unemployment
 dbdr: a smart company would accept an employee working 75% of the time for 75% of pay. they will be more productive in average, so it's a net gain
 dbdr: since your productivity goes now as you get tired
 MSmits: thats not guaranteed, but they might be more productive yes
 MSmits: there's also a work-experience/learning argument
 MSmits: when you reduce the percentage, at some point you will spend too much of your time learning how to do the work
 dbdr: will depend on the situation, for sure
 MSmits: but 75% seems very nice for the company, if the lines of communication are good
 MSmits: like... when i am off work, i will still reply to e-mails flexibly
 MSmits: I will even work when I am off work if necessary and I'll work less on another day
 dbdr: reminds me of this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNzXze5Yza8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNzXze5Yza8</a>
 dbdr: apparently it's a real ad. to me it feels like a parody
 MSmits: thats because of the actor in it
 Astrobytes: Jeez
 MSmits: he always plays humorous mega-villains
 Scarfield: lol
 dbdr: I don't know the actor
 dbdr: for me it's because of the message
 dbdr: nice top comment by the way
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0Js2TP04k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0Js2TP04k</a>
 Astrobytes: It is a real ad 
 Astrobytes: btw
 Scarfield: yea, and apparently a serious one :o
 Astrobytes: Grim, ain't it.
 Scarfield: Brothers. Grim, aint it. :p
 Astrobytes: Grimm really, but yeah :P
 Astrobytes: Spellingfield
 Scarfield: hehe, well i would have had spelled either the name or the word wrong, there was no winning :p
 Astrobytes: Hahaha
 jacek: springfield
 JBM: damn on HL before the big thoughtful discussion
 JBM: now i've read it all, damn you astroes
 Scarfield: ban&#160;!
 Scarfield: or !ban :thinking:
 JBM: that mod list is getting dangerously close to the window hwight
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Oh nice writeup on your site btw JBM
 Astrobytes: The Brainfuck one
 JBM: glad you liked it
 Astrobytes: Moar content needed. You have a good style of writing imo
 JBM: you have no idea how many times i proofread it
 Astrobytes: I think I spotted an error, hang on
 JBM: plz tell
 Astrobytes: Found it. In the "But why?" section, "The brainfuck case stands out with the compiler being typically easier to implement than the compiler"
 JBM: lol
 JBM: good catch thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 JBM: there, fixed
 Astrobytes: Cool. Also, "It sags the mind" is possibly the best title ever, nevermind Brainfuck-related title
 Astrobytes: *shags
 JBM: yeah that one took some time too
 Scarfield: "Shall we shag now, or shall we shag later, baby"
 Astrobytes: Yeah, very Austin Powers to most, yet very normal here in the UK&#160;;)
 JBM: shag tends to pass way more word filters than fuck
 JBM: i had to get so creative to be able to even edit my twitch "started streaming" message
 jacek: braincoitus?
 JBM: no it reads as brainfuck
 Astrobytes: Well played in any case
 JBM: lemme check what the final version is
 JBM: those people did their work
 JBM: "JBM started streaming in brainſ̵uck.Boy was that a tough broadcast message to get past Twitch."
 JBM: LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S&#160;; COMBINING SHORT STROKE OVERLAY
 JBM: anything 1-char in the f's place was no no
 JBM: (or the u or the c)
 Astrobytes: Hah! Very nice
 JBM: took me 20 tries to find something acceptable
 Astrobytes: Being Scottish it's always difficult to understand why anything has a 'bad' language filter in the first place.
 JBM: us monoculture
 Astrobytes: True. I imagine the French have similar issues with it.
 JBM: not sure
 JBM: what do you mean more precisely?
 Astrobytes: A lot of casual phrases in French are considered bad language in the UK
 JBM: for example?
 Astrobytes: As in less culturally acceptable
 MSmits: j'ai une grosse baguette
 JBM: that one's ostensibly ridiculous
 MSmits: thats what i was going for
 jacek: omelette du fromage
 JBM: that one's like not even really french
 MSmits: makes sense
 jacek: dexter's doesnt lie
 JBM: was in dexter?
 JBM: don't remember
 JBM: i've seen the meme propagate, and never really understood who it was trying to make fun of
 MSmits: dexter?
 MSmits: the show about the serial killer?
 jacek: the cartton
 eulerscheZahl: Dexter Morgan
 jacek: how old are you
 Astrobytes: Dexter's Laboratory
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kArCRjT29w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kArCRjT29w</a>
 Astrobytes: JBM, I should have said words tbh, not phrases. e.g. putain, merde are (in my experience) a lot easier to get away with in many situations than me saying shit and fuck in English company
 JBM: is that the source?
 eulerscheZahl: i miss some cartoon knowledge.a lot was aired on a station called SuperRTL. We had an antenna shared with the neighborhood and a bandwidth for 22 channels. majority vote was against the cartoon station
 JBM: ah, ok
 Astrobytes: and yeah that's the source of that quote
 MSmits: dexter for me will always be dexter morgan. Great show
 JBM: yeah, same here
 eulerscheZahl: and damn Kinderkanal was one of them. cartoons too but more pedagogic value
 wlesavo: books actually quite ok too, but the plot is very different, so that it becomes a little bit annoying if you saw the series
 JBM: ok now i saw the source
 JBM: so yeah Astrobytes shit and (some translations of) fuck are rather common in everyday french
 JBM: they're still categorized "bad" (like, my mother would NEVER say them)
 JBM: but no one bats an eye
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah absolutely, just less taboo than they are here
 JBM: yes
 JBM: a good thing too, imho
 Astrobytes: Yes I agree fully
 JBM: not that cursing is the point or anything
 JBM: but being afraid of words is not only pointless, but self-defeating
 Astrobytes: No, it's legitimate expression.
 Astrobytes: Absolutely
 JBM: i'm more like "ok, magic button, tomorrow the word shit disappears from everywhere, words, books, memories"
 Astrobytes: It's the "brush it under the carpet and it'll go away" mentality
 JBM: well, people are going to invent a new word to ban anyway
 Scarfield: made me think of this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/rkfFyELXdoM?t=4">https://youtu.be/rkfFyELXdoM?t=4</a>
 Astrobytes: Quite.
 JBM: you can't ban talking about reproduction
 JBM: and you can't ban people insulting each other
 JBM: the choice of words they use... so insignificant
 JBM: (well you *can* ban people insulting each other, but they're still going to do it)
 Astrobytes: Be a bit more prudent to address why they are insulting each other in the first place tbh
 JBM: because people need an antagonist?
 Astrobytes: Yep. Modern existence seems to be all about skirting around the issue and finding a scapegoat.
 Astrobytes: Hell, all our existence.
 JBM: gays, muslims, protestants two centuries back, eastasia
 JBM: wait it's more than two
 JBM: darn, my entire argument invalid&#160;:(
 jacek: clashers
 Astrobytes: The Catholic/Protestant issue is alive and well in Scotland and Ireland
 JBM: scotland too?
 Astrobytes: (as an aside)
 Astrobytes: Yes
 JBM: didn't know
 Astrobytes: Many Irish came here, so you still have the republic vs the crown
 Astrobytes: Alive and well in football rivalry, separate schools, divides in towns (by street, sometimes groups of houses in the same street)
 Astrobytes: Not formal divides in towns, informal. 
 Astrobytes: It's pretty sickening. Orange Order walks/processions are still a thing
 JBM: *googling*
 JBM: #Controversy
 Astrobytes: That's the Protestant side, the Orangemen.
 jacek: orange order, trump?
 Astrobytes: Battle of the Boyne, William of Orange, etc etc
 JBM: oh wait
 Astrobytes: Nothing but religious bigotry.
 JBM: that's *our* Orange
 JBM: took me 3 wikilinks
 JBM: lol
 JBM: not sure anyone there's still aware of that
 Astrobytes: What part? He fought against a Catholic French dude iirc
 JBM: "William of Orange"
 JBM: from the principality of Orange, Provence
 JBM: 90min's drive from here
 Astrobytes: Ah right, yeah. Unimportant detail if you're engaged in persistent  multi-generational religious bigotry
 JBM: sure
 JBM: i figured claiming the land would be their endgame
 JBM: silly me
 MSmits: hmm Willem van Oranje?
 JBM: it's all about bickering with the catholics
 Astrobytes: I don't speak to about 2/3 of my family because they're Orange lunatics
 MSmits: he;s in our national anthem
 JBM: treaty of Utrecht ceded the land back to france
 MSmits: or is william of Orange&#160;!= Willem van Oranje&#160;?
 JBM: could be a link
 Astrobytes: Well he was Dutch so I guess so
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: he's basically considered our founding father of sorts
 JBM: orange was also famous in the 90s for being one of the first town halls to "fall" to the racist FN
 Astrobytes: Willem Hendrik MSmits?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Silent">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Silent</a>
 Astrobytes: Figures JBM, all the Orangemen I know are racists of the most ignorant kind
 JBM: i KNEW it
 MSmits: why do you know so many racists that it becomes statistically significant Astrobytes&#160;?
 MSmits: :worried:
 JBM: i'm afraid we all do
 JBM: knowingly or not
 Astrobytes: To be clear for anyone not in the know, the Orangemen/Protestant crowd in the UK are Unionists, that is they endorse the occupation of Northern Ireland by the crown  
 MSmits: ah right
 MSmits: great britain needs more atheists
 Astrobytes: And have a vitriolic hatred of Catholics
 Astrobytes: (I was raised Protestant)
 Astrobytes: *born into
 jacek: its solar empire vs new lunar republic all over again
 MSmits: I was raised heretic
 Astrobytes: It's a load of old bollocks is what it is
 MSmits: does bollocks get through the twitch filter
 MSmits: jbm, go do another stream
 Astrobytes: And the flames are fanned by increasingly far-right government in Westminster
 JBM: MSmits: nobody watches my streams, what's the point :p
 MSmits: I don't watch any streams, but if I did I would watch yours JBM
 Astrobytes: There were 4 or 5 viewers when I joined late the other night
 JBM: it's been "stable" between 5 and 12 all along
 JBM: i'm in it for the long tail
 Astrobytes: If you wish to learn you a Haskell for great good JBMs streams are worth a watch
 JBM: i *think* (i oughta check) i get a lot more views on youtube
 JBM: MSmits: that's [would be] so nice of you! :D
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Probably. Time constraints/timezone constraints  mean streaming niche stuff never gets the views at the time
 JBM: yea that plays for a lot
 MSmits: I spend way too much time following what happens in the US
 MSmits: i should stop that
 Astrobytes: Watch JBM streams, get inspired and then punish your soul by writing Haskell very badly
 MSmits: does JBM do CG  stuff in haskell?
 JBM: (or better, if you stay to the end)
 JBM: yeah that tends to happen
 JBM: but i've also streamed C++ and Perl
 MSmits: what made you decide to do this?
 JBM: boredom ;p
 MSmits: I shared on you tube before, but streaming is a different beast
 Astrobytes: I didn't mean JBM's Haskell was bad btw, I mean mines is bad
 MSmits: oh, I wonder if i'll learn haskell next year
 BenFreanklin: HI
 MSmits: I signed up to functional programming course
 Astrobytes: You should definitely do some videos MSmits, if not streams
 MSmits: are they likely to use haskell?
 BenFreanklin: On a pickle watt up
 Astrobytes: Lisp for sure
 JBM: which uni?
 JBM: utrecht has a big haskell rep
 MSmits: Astrobytes personally I like writing &gt; youtube &gt; livestreaming
 MSmits: hmm might be utrecht
 Astrobytes: Whatever suits&#160;:)
 JBM: they used to maintain a haskell compiler of their own, UHC
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: let me see if i can find this
 MSmits: Elm!
 MSmits: is what they use
 JBM: oh, elm
 JBM: "it's complicated"
 MSmits: I have no idea,
 MSmits: brb
 kingslayer2020: hi
 firecraftgaming: I love how people seriosly doesnt think im 13 years old
 kingslayer2020: me too
 firecraftgaming: it isnt a joke i am 13 years old
 JBM: sure yeou are
 kingslayer2020: yap me too
 Astrobytes: We heard you the first time
 firecraftgaming: yes i am how should i prove it
 AntiSquid: i think you're 12
 MSmits: you have to be at least 14 imho
 MSmits: firecraftgaming how old will you be in 21 years
 JBM: why would you even want to?
 firecraftgaming: 34
 MSmits: how about in twice that many years
 AntiSquid: no idea how this started by why should everyone care firecraftgaming?
 AntiSquid: anyone *
 JBM: he started it on his own
 JBM: how convincingly suspicious
 AntiSquid: i just entered chat and i see this mess
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 MSmits: he's still working on my math puzzle, don't distract him
 Astrobytes: You missed all the good conversation AntiSquid
 firecraftgaming: what math puzzle????
 MSmits: how old would you be in twice that many years
 MSmits: it's important
 AntiSquid: he did answer you MSmits
 firecraftgaming: ok? 55
 MSmits: i asked a followup
 MSmits: ah see
 MSmits: thats too smart
 MSmits: if you said 68 i would have believed you were 13
 firecraftgaming: haha
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: want another chance firecraftgaming?
 MSmits: to prove you're 13?
 Astrobytes: Just mention Minecraft
 JBM: take a nude pic; send it to any of the americans here
 Astrobytes: Or what's that other crap, Roblox
 JBM: if the fbi brings their door down, you were 13 or less
 Scarfield: how do you tame a horse in minecraft?
 dbdr: seems like the "prove you're a human" asimov story, where the robot has to pretend to be dummer than he is
 AntiSquid: bad argument Astrobytes, lots of 40+ people stream minecraft and other pixelart games
 MSmits: err i think they'd be bringing your door down JBM :P
 Astrobytes: Not Roblox though AntiSQuid
 JBM: i'm not american
 Astrobytes: And yes, fair point
 MSmits: since when has that stopped them
 AntiSquid: i am sure even roblox
 JBM: mmm good pt
 Astrobytes: Surely not AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: Nice point of reference dbdr
 AntiSquid: i occasionally tune into twitch and check some random games, often see bored tired old faces of people playing all sorts of games and i wonder why?
 MSmits: i know
 dbdr: I wonder how
 MSmits: you search for tired old faces on twitch
 MSmits: better search terms
 AntiSquid: lol dbdr
 Astrobytes: Hmm. Cult of celebrity, monetisation, low self esteem... need I go on
 AntiSquid: sure MSmits
 JBM: and all that you could see was...?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sleepy">https://www.twitch.tv/sleepy</a>
 MSmits: this came up when i searched for tired old faces
 dbdr: just another ...
 AntiSquid: there's some streamers worth watching every now and then
 JBM: tired old face
 dbdr: red black tree
 JBM: what a lousy rhyme
 JBM: ah, better
 kingslayer2020: are we coding orr??
 JBM: no u
 AntiSquid: kingslayer2020 sure, have any ideas?
 kingslayer2020: yap what i expected
 AntiSquid: what did you even expect?
 Astrobytes: Are YOU coding kingslayer2020
 kingslayer2020: some people saying no
 kingslayer2020: nop
 Astrobytes: That is the pertinent question here. And if not - why not?!
 MSmits: I coded a line only 10 mins ago kingslayer2020
 AntiSquid: does it count as coding if you just graph plots in python&#160;? kingslayer2020 
 kingslayer2020: i dont know
 Astrobytes: I commented something out a minute ago, if that counts
 kingslayer2020: maybe
 AntiSquid: maybe not
 kingslayer2020: i dont know
 Astrobytes: Get coding kingslayer2020
 kingslayer2020: how about you ask msmits here
 coderinblack: alr
 AntiSquid: in the future if i do an API call to some advanced ML model to solve a problem for me, is it still coding?
 AntiSquid: kingslayer2020
 Astrobytes: bms coderinblack
 kingslayer2020: i guess so
 kingslayer2020: what do you think??
 AntiSquid: well i wrote the one line API call so ofc
 AntiSquid: hard work
 Astrobytes: More coding less chatting kingslayer2020
 kingslayer2020: ha not the smartest guy here are you??
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 is
 Automaton2000: i'm curious how much you can do that in c#
 kingslayer2020: so much
 kingslayer2020: you would get blindd
 AntiSquid: also you need to get an avatar
 MSmits: Automaton2000 what kind of avatar does kingslayer2020 need&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i don't know why it does not
 Astrobytes: So much talking rubbish, you could get a warning kingslayer2020
 MSmits: Automaton2000 that's an unacceptable answer
 Automaton2000: still not sure how to make a game for cg&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Tell us how Automaton2000
 MSmits: Automaton2000 just make a teapot
 Automaton2000: can you paste the code
 MSmits: euler did
 Automaton2000: but you did well on a few
 Astrobytes: Not the point Automaton2000, tell us how you do it
 Automaton2000: was about to write that
 Astrobytes: Go on then Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but you have to check
 MSmits: Automaton2000 is stalling
 Automaton2000: because that is the question
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes don't be hard on kingslayer2020, guy is new here
 MSmits: think he might be new anywhere?
 AntiSquid: welcome to CG kingslayer2020 what are you up to&#160;?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Not being hard, I just don't take fools lightly
 kingslayer2020: well coding i guess and gaming
 MSmits: so you take them hard?
 LmK1337: :P
 JBM: do they like it?
 LmK1337: hey anyone here programs PLCs&#160;?
 MSmits: you can count on jbm to make it weird
 Astrobytes: I take fools harder than a hard thing on a hard day
 Astrobytes: You started that one MSmits, you always do. Don't feign innocence here
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: hey, to be fair, i only realized that after i typed it
 MSmits: was still before i hit enter though
 Astrobytes: see!
 Astrobytes: I shall rephrase. I do not suffer fools gladly.
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes CG was far more fun when i joined, back when madao was active and trash talking along with other new peeps in chat, good times&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: You need to stay in chat more often then, you've missed it
 MSmits: are you saying CG has gotten too nice?
 AntiSquid: also madao "lol, want me to ban you AntiSquid?"
 Astrobytes: And was trying to get Maddy back ;ast night
 Astrobytes: *last
 MSmits: how?
 Scarfield: secret rituals i presume
 kingslayer2020: ms sits:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+not+to+be+stupid+-+a+guide+to+critical+thinkinghttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+not+to+be+stupid+-+a+guide+to+critical+thinking">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+not+to+be+stupid+-+a+guide+to+critical+thinkinghttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+not+to+be+stupid+-+a+guide+to+critical+thinking</a>
 AntiSquid: just my impression
 Astrobytes: He 'slipped' into Gorbit's DMs. So I had a chat by proxy
 kingslayer2020: i think you need it
 MSmits: kingslayer2020 it's great that you are looking to improve yourself
 Astrobytes: He says he was busy but will come back
 AntiSquid: kingslayer2020 trolling overload 
 kingslayer2020: ohh you mean you
 MSmits: indeed, i did say you
 Astrobytes: Try harder kingslayer2020
 kingslayer2020: yeah your stupid enough not to recognize yourself
 AntiSquid: no . kingslayer2020 please be more polite . get along with the other users
 kingslayer2020: fine
 Astrobytes: OR just be a knob
 AntiSquid: get an anime avatar
 Astrobytes: Or no avatar and a good reputation
 MSmits: also, when you're calling people stupid, don't say "your stupid". It's you're 
 AntiSquid: kingslayer2020 what games do you like and what do you like to code? also get an anime avatar
 MSmits: just some helpful advice :P
 JBM: what's an avatar
 MSmits: it's like a smurf, but more elongated
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: don't listen to JBM, he's the chat villain
 JBM: am i?
 AntiSquid: yes
 kingslayer2020: thanks for your information mssmits but i prefer my way
 JBM: how did i gain the title?
 AntiSquid: nothing official, i can't grant titles
 MSmits: kingslayer2020 ok, but prepare to be misunderstood
 JBM: darn
 Astrobytes: I thought the Villain was MadKnight
 AntiSquid: why
 kingslayer2020: as you wish
 Astrobytes: It's his discord
 AntiSquid: kingslayer2020 your means belonging, you're is contraction of you are
 MSmits: AntiSquid don't jinx it
 MSmits: you just made him nicer
 kingslayer2020:&#160;??
 AntiSquid: your *something* = the something that belongs to the person you address
 kingslayer2020: what does that even man
 AntiSquid: if i say Automaton2000 your idiot, it means i am telling Automaton2000 i am his idiot
 MSmits: I mean I just noticed you got nicer and now AntiSquid is annoying you again :P
 Automaton2000: that's the only reason i can think of that
 MSmits: Automaton2000 already assumed you were AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: See, now this is why I wish we had a delete on the chat
 Automaton2000: when i have time i will make a ga for that
 AntiSquid: why? lol
 Astrobytes: So we can delete trash talk stuff
 Astrobytes: afterwards I mean
 AntiSquid: did i do something wrong?&#160;:(
 MSmits: nah, not this time
 Astrobytes: No lol
 MSmits: but we got a log now, I'm sure if I dig....
 JBM: i call that not "yet"
 Astrobytes: I mean, when the trash talking is done, we can clean it up
 kingslayer2020: its me isn't it??
 JBM: it's not us it's you
 AntiSquid: MSmits hm ya there were often fun arguments in chat
 MSmits: I remember you and re curse going at it :P
 AntiSquid: kingslayer2020 you're alright, just missing an avatar, no worries
 MSmits: dont remember when exactly
 Astrobytes: Oh I wouldn't delete stuff like that
 Astrobytes: Just random stuff that serves no purpose
 AntiSquid: i don't consider that even worth mentioning MSmits
 kingslayer2020: im  trying but its not my problem the file arent uploading
 MSmits: allright&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe the dimensions arent correct
 MSmits: you can use a simple paint program to cut it a bit so it has the right size
 AntiSquid: maybe it's not an anime avatar&#160;?
 AntiSquid: were you trying to upload something else?
 Astrobytes: you need m-dimensional pics on here
 MSmits: m-theory?
 AntiSquid: where is the node-js guy gone? firecraftgaming you just joined the community, are you already gone?
 Astrobytes: Sure. Gotta use your m-brane
 MSmits: AntiSquid thats because you didn't believe he was 13
 JBM:   i forgot who was 13
 MSmits: or wasn't
 MSmits: he never did prove it
 JBM: thta one
 AntiSquid: i said 12, he will be 13 in a year no?
 JBM: hopefully
 MSmits: might be less even
 Astrobytes: Not if he carries on like that
 MSmits: a year would be the upper limit of that
 JBM: is he in a "herd immunity" kind of country?
 AntiSquid: wow that expression ...
 MSmits: I'm immune to herds, when a herd of people all do one thing, I do the opposity
 MSmits: opposite
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 MSmits: are people in a herd immunity country immune to herd mentality?
 AntiSquid: netherlands isn't as strict as other countries i heard
 Astrobytes: Herd immunity comes from vaccination parlance, it's totally misappropriated wrt Covid, UK government wholly responsible
 Scarfield: so if a herd of people where all hetero, how would you react?
 MSmits: it was pretty strict before, but it's gonna be bad after next week I am afraid&#160;:(
 MSmits: schools open up
 MSmits: no restrictions at all
 AntiSquid: sweden never had a real lockdown during this time so is it really that bad?
 MSmits: recipe for disaster I think
 MSmits: sweden had way more deaths
 Astrobytes: Schools opened today here. Apart from a few that were flooded/damaged after last nights 7 hour thunderstorm
 MSmits: than most countries
 dbdr: some people saying sweden counted better
 AntiSquid: true, but media blown up the entire thing out of proportions, some where thinking 90% of people out there will die
 MSmits: Sweden: 571  per million. Netherlands: 359 per million
 MSmits: and Netherlands is more densely populated
 MSmits: which makes it easier to spread
 Astrobytes: Sweden were a little more complacent initially.
 Scarfield: the minister responsoble for the approach in sweden admitted they didnt do enough
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: AntiSquid people keep forgetting that the deathrate is not the most important thing
 AntiSquid: belgium 865 per million, what happened there?
 MSmits: I think there are more people surviving with lifetime serious health considitons than people dying
 Astrobytes: While the shit was hitting the fan here my friend Erik was not giving a shit (he's a chef) and everything was open, continuing as normal
 MSmits: conditions that is
 Astrobytes: Yes. People are not grasping the consequences MSmits.
 MSmits: AntiSquid I think Belgium counted everyone dying in nursing homes as having died of covid, it should maybe be 100 lower or so, or 200
 Astrobytes: They still think it's a cold
 AntiSquid: at the end of the day i hope russia is honest about having a vaccine
 jacek: its :vodka:
 Astrobytes: Missed out 3rd phase
 MSmits: you mean having a safe and effective vaccine
 jacek: who cares about 3rd phase
 Scarfield: it does so that you dont die from covid, in 100% of the cases
 dbdr: russia is not more advanced than others, they just announced earlier
 Astrobytes: Antibody-dependent enhancement
 IfIHadATail: oh good my facebook feed has spilled over to codingame&#160;:/
 MSmits: I am not on facebook
 MSmits: this is my facebook :P
 Astrobytes: The 3rd phase of testing is supposed to eliminate that possiblity
 AntiSquid: with all the russia hacking conspiracies out there thought they might at least have stollen it from elsewhere dbdr
 MSmits: AntiSquid is my mark zuckerberg
 Astrobytes: *possibility
 DarkDev: who knows lua
 AntiSquid: woah MSmits what does that suppose to mean?&#160;:/ not sure how to perceive that
 MSmits: hey, i thought you wanted to trashtalk
 MSmits: I am making a serious effort here
 Scarfield: he thinks you are a lizard im sure
 Astrobytes: The virus can sometimes cause a more severe response when exposed a second time, that's the danger of not doing the 3rd phase testing
 Astrobytes: *when you are exposed a second time
 MSmits: Mark zuckerberg talks like a robot, you talk *to* a robot, it's similar
 AntiSquid: no MSmits, geez have some moderation
 IfIHadATail: DarkDev it is just easier to post your question in the chat and people that know the answer will help you
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: It's an immune response, it depends on the antibodies produced in the initial infection
 AntiSquid: and if i was you're mark zuck then i'd ban you AND sell your data
 Scarfield: xD
 IfIHadATail: cause like i know Lua but I don't "know" Lua if you get my drift :P
 MSmits: I think he would just sell my data
 Astrobytes: Absolutely nobody listening to my explanation of why the Russian vaccine announcement is bad.
 AntiSquid: i am reading, just not speed reading 
 MSmits: thats because I mentioned zuckerberg
 IfIHadATail: I'm not russian so I could care less
 jacek: and i forgot the topic of conversation
 Astrobytes: Bearing in mind I work in pharma and am a biologist
 jacek: im sorry
 MSmits: jacek
 MSmits: lemme get you up to speed
 MSmits: Astrobytes is filling us in about the conspiracies
 AntiSquid: it's the usual CG topic jacek
 Astrobytes: No conspiracies
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: then you must be deep-state
 Astrobytes: Clearly.
 Astrobytes: Cold hard science has that effect.
 IfIHadATail: lol everyone thinks they aren't a conspiracy theorist 
 MSmits: but sure, the stupidest thing you can do is a poorly tested vaccine. There's already people afraid of fake vaccins
 MSmits: of real i mean
 AntiSquid: i also wonder every time i see the word vaccine, will it help against all strands of the virus&#160;??
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liiVX55tJ7E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liiVX55tJ7E</a>
 Astrobytes: No way to tell currently AntiSquid, it's a completely new virus
 MSmits: I think it also depends on what type of vaccine
 MSmits: it's also possible that it doesnt work on all strands, but the strands it doesnt work on are harmless
 MSmits: it may not have to work on all
 Astrobytes: The variants seen so far are not harmless
 MSmits: no, but you dont see the harmless variants maybe?
 MSmits: because they are harmless
 AntiSquid: are mers and sars harmless?
 Astrobytes: Haven't checked the sequencing data, if it's there tbh, I admit
 MSmits: there's a selection effect there for sure
 Astrobytes: Covid is a SARS variant (of sorts)
 MSmits: AntiSquid the vaccine wont work against those for sure
 MSmits: too different
 MSmits: from what i understand vaccines are usually more specific than that
 Astrobytes: It's called SARS-CoV-2 for a reason&#160;;)
 IfIHadATail: viruses mutate and the vaccines chase the mutations that is why you need to get them all the time 
 Astrobytes: Yes, precisely.
 MSmits: I dont get them all the time though?
 jacek: i wonder how the russian put the autism into vaccine so quickly
 MSmits: lol...
 AntiSquid: as long as it's not a Microsoft TM vaccine :p
 Astrobytes: Oh here we go
 IfIHadATail: he said using his free OS that tracks everything he does :P
 MSmits: I had quite a scare the one time I tried to install windows 10
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes it's meme worthy at least
 Astrobytes: Anyway, good chat. Catch you all tomorrow&#160;:) gn
 Astrobytes: hehehe :D
 MSmits: it really tries to get you to connect your microsoft account to your windows installation
 MSmits: I tried my work account and suddenly my windows computer was basically a work terminal
 MSmits: the button to install without an account was really well hidden
 AntiSquid: Bill Gates intended for a some invisible ink tatoo, so it makes people talk
 IfIHadATail: yeah they are trying to make the expereience seamless between devices
 MSmits: I dont want my boss to control my private computer :P
 AntiSquid: run windows 10 on a VM inside linux eh
 IfIHadATail: yeah I don't have the whole "work" problem right now :P
 IfIHadATail: must be a nice problem to have
 MSmits: lose your job due to covid?
 IfIHadATail: no I lost it due to work related injury
 MSmits: ah that's worse, sorry to hear that
 IfIHadATail: yeah well that is how I finally took the steps into coding so love-hate lol
 MSmits: I'd give up a toe to discover coding
 MSmits: maybe two
 IfIHadATail: 20 year career down the drain for this new and scary one lol
 IfIHadATail: honestly I've wanted to do this for ages so yeah I just hope it works out lol
 AntiSquid: what were you before&#160;?
 IfIHadATail: custom metal fabricator 
 AntiSquid: ok
 MSmits: career changes are always scary voluntary or involuntary
 IfIHadATail: yup it was fun while it lasted lol
 AntiSquid: wasn't for me MSmits
 AntiSquid: i thought "screw it, whatever happens happens"
 MSmits: maybe because you were swinging knives in your previous job
 MSmits: nothing scares you anymore
 AntiSquid: YOLO
 AntiSquid: try to make the most out of it?
 MSmits: did Jordan Peterson talk you into it?
 AntiSquid: IfIHadATail i don't have any idea what your previous job involves, but wouldn't data science (maybe some machine learning) be helpful for you&#160;? do you have a strong chemical background?
 AntiSquid: i mean you could combine the knowledge you have with that and get yourself further than just "coding" imo
 AntiSquid: no MSmits
 MSmits: he talks a lot of that kind of thing, youtube for some reason has decided i should watch him
 AntiSquid: now that you mentioned him, would like to know what you think about him&#160;? curious
 MSmits: I like him when he talks about what he 's an expert in
 MSmits: his field
 AntiSquid: forgot about his existence, watched him briefly confronting some weird activist, watched him talk and then i thought he is wasting his breath with those people, then moved on
 MSmits: he has a lot of followers online
 AntiSquid: watched him talk about life in general i mean *
 MSmits: millions
 IfIHadATail: I do not have a strong chemical background no. I did study metals but only how I would use them in their annealed, normalized, and hardened states definitely no chemestry involved :P
 IfIHadATail: or extremely little
 AntiSquid: entertaining for a while, but i felt i need to move on at some point, it feels like watching same ideas over and over again after a while MSmits
 MSmits: yeah
 IfIHadATail: I'd be closer at home in engineering TBH
 MSmits: Simulated Annealing should feel right at home&#160;:)
 kingslayer2020: has anyone completed thee coders strike back  challenge??
 IfIHadATail: which challenge is that?
 MSmits: kingslayer2020 it's not a challenge you complete. It's a multiplayer competitive arena
 MSmits: you just get better and rank higher
 kingslayer2020: fine whatever you say
 MSmits: but sure
 MSmits: I rank fairly high, ask
 kingslayer2020: has anyone done it though??
 MSmits: almost everyone
 AntiSquid: well you could get 1st place and pretend you completed it, but nothing on that ranking seems to last forever
 IfIHadATail: oh right the competition. Yeah I just got to gold the other day&#160;: )
 MSmits: good job
 inoryy: "I rank fairly high" says top5 competitor
 MSmits: 6th
 kingslayer2020: how do you adjust th thrust
 inoryy: oh that changes everything, carry on
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 IfIHadATail: TY&#160;: ) my bot completely skipped silver league and I was pretty proud of that actually lol
 MSmits: kingslayer2020 just use a power lower than 100
 kingslayer2020: thnx
 AntiSquid: nice, now do ocean of code IfIHadATail
 MSmits: but usually you either do 0 or 100 to make this simple, I do
 MSmits: when you turn you could sometimes do 0 to turn more easily
 AntiSquid: if you dare that is :p
 IfIHadATail: I might do that next. I just wanted to see if I can get higher in coders strike back first cause I only got as far as getting my program to work with now having two pods
 MSmits: IfIHadATail ooc has a high entry level 
 kingslayer2020: print(30 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 0):corrections
 AntiSquid: was half joking, it's imo the hardest on CG
 MSmits: yeah might be
 inoryy: really?
 MSmits: locam is fairly complicated to start out in as well
 AntiSquid: i said imo MSmits, just my opinion
 kingslayer2020: print(30 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 0)
 IfIHadATail: OOC was actually my first ever live competition on codingame ever lol
 MSmits: yeah i am not sure, maybe I agree
 kingslayer2020: print(30 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 0)
 IfIHadATail: I bare made it to bronze lol
 kingslayer2020: print(30 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 0)
 kingslayer2020: print(30 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 0)
 kingslayer2020: print(30 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 0)
 kingslayer2020: print(30 &lt;= thrust &lt;= 0)
 AntiSquid: please don't spam
 MSmits: maybe he thinks he has to output it here?
 kingslayer2020: fine just correct me
 MSmits: i dont know what language that
 MSmits: is
 kingslayer2020: python
 MSmits: does python do &lt;= in strings? I didnt even know
 AntiSquid: but that's a comparison afaik @_@
 AntiSquid: you want to output a value&#160;?!
 inoryy: aside from why would you print that in the first place, you're testing for x to be in-between [30, 0] with 0 being upper bound..
 AntiSquid: print(x,y,thrust)&#160;???
 AntiSquid: forgot CSB
 IfIHadATail: yeah
 MSmits: inoryy will that always be false?
 MSmits: so he just prints false?
 inoryy: unless math changed
 MSmits: been out of the loop lately
 MSmits: might have
 inoryy: as with physics?&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:(
 jacek: pi is 3.2 now
 IfIHadATail: :O
 AntiSquid: new version? 
 MSmits: oh noes, they changed pi!
 inoryy: monsters, everyone knows it's 3
 jacek: pi was too OP, they nerfed it
 kingslayer2020: when your more nicer  thats the day monkeys will fly
 IfIHadATail: they are always trying to find ways to give us less for the same cost
 MSmits: is this because of changes in the space time curvature? Are we now non-euclidean?
 IfIHadATail: we are using facebook physics now
 AntiSquid: you need to change your perception, don't assume people are being mean so easily kingslayer2020
 IfIHadATail: where that guy that got a c in science class in HS is an expert in everything
 MSmits: our worst crime here is trying to be funny kingslayer2020
 MSmits: HS?
 MSmits: hypersonic?
 AntiSquid: worst crime is laughing at our own jokes, while thinking everyone else laughs along
 IfIHadATail: lol high school :P
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: guilty!
 IfIHadATail: super guilty
 MSmits: ok ok super guilty then
 MSmits: jeez dont rub it in
 IfIHadATail: :D
 AntiSquid: kingslayer2020 look at the statement check required output format
 AntiSquid: also gave you an example earlier
 MSmits: AntiSquid is being super nice, he would have said RTFM otherwise
 AntiSquid: this is your fault guys, making fun of Madknight until he quit CG, he used to help everyone in CSB
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: euler still helps
 MSmits: and he doesnt try to get you on teamspeak :P
 IfIHadATail: oof you guys made someone leave?
 MSmits: nahh 
 AntiSquid: but euler isn't anything like the high priest of a CSB cult
 MSmits: madknight is a nice guy that helps, but a little weird sometimes. He has not been very active as a player for a loooong time
 IfIHadATail: wow didn't know there was a cult
 AntiSquid: i just made it sound dramatic IfIHadATail
 AntiSquid: the cult part is also me making it sound dramatic
 MSmits: not coding much, just trashtalking veterans and helping new people
 IfIHadATail: looks my aspirations of leegeond are dead 
 AntiSquid: he did code
 IfIHadATail: I can spell I swear
 MSmits: hmm not much in the time i was here?
 AntiSquid: IfIHadATail don't worry about madknight, actually he liked to try stuff out outside CG 
 MSmits: not in contests and i didnt see him appear much in multis
 AntiSquid: he basically just moved on
 MSmits: aside from CSB
 AntiSquid: he spent a lot of time on rendering a cube from scratch in C&#160;! :D
 AntiSquid: coding NES games
 AntiSquid: then trying out other stuff and inviting people to try it out too
 IfIHadATail:  lol sounds like fun &gt;.&gt;
 MSmits: yeah he would sometimes PM me asking how to do those things or getting me to do them
 AntiSquid: IfIHadATail ya the conversation resulting from that was fun
 IfIHadATail: lol
 MSmits: didnt he also do a lot of chess?
 AntiSquid: wonder if he managed to train a model that renders a 3D cube for him
 AntiSquid: isn't cyberpunk the chess guy&#160;?
 IfIHadATail: I honestly can't wait 'til I am good enough to make bots for games. IDK why but that just sounds super fun to me 
 MSmits: I thought they both were, but might be wrong
 AntiSquid: people get bored after a while IfIHadATail, or they try to learn new things while still being on CG every now and then
 MSmits: IfIHadATail it is super fun, but there isn't a clear line where you can say you are "good enough"
 MSmits: dont put the bar too high
 MSmits: sometimes a few lines of code can get you halfway up the ladder in some games
 AntiSquid: IfIHadATail not sure what you mean by good enough, you just do, fail, correct the mistakes, do some more, fail, read forums about post mortems, fail again ...
 IfIHadATail: well I mean like making bots for actual games
 AntiSquid: ya even that
 MSmits: oh outside CG?
 AntiSquid: same approach
 IfIHadATail: yeah&#160;: )
 AntiSquid: google a tutorial
 IfIHadATail: well I don't know how to get my code to interact with the games lol
 AntiSquid: and follow along, google another tutorial ... 
 BenVlodgi: I'm working on AI for an actual game, but taking a break to play CSB here xD
 AntiSquid: eventually you get an idea
 IfIHadATail: and I can't for the life of me find out how
 MSmits: IfIHadATail I learned most of my coding writing mods for space engineers. Its awesome for learning how to code
 MSmits: and it's physics
 AntiSquid: start with "google dino bot" i think that's simple enough
 MSmits: and there's metal too
 MSmits: is that the cactus jumping thing?
 IfIHadATail: and it'll tell me how to control other programs with my program? that is seriously the wall I can't get over right now
 MSmits: control other programs with your program?
 MSmits: how do you mean exactly?
 Uljahn: like with autohotkey?
 MSmits: do you mean the bot interfacing with the controls of a game?
 MSmits: like an auto-aim bot in a shoot em up?
 IfIHadATail: yeah like I want to write program that reads the state of a game makes calculations and then outputs controls
 IfIHadATail: IDK if like an aim-bot
 MSmits: ahh well, in some games they give you an API
 MSmits: and it's just a matter of using the right commands
 MSmits: space engineers has an API. You could a ship there, mine craft-like and then write code to fly it automatically, using C#
 MSmits: build a ship i mean
 IfIHadATail: well like I want to be able to make a bot that can play Gradius for NES 
 AntiSquid: IfIHadATail which kind of games do you want to write a bot for? you could use a macro editor for repetitive tasks type of games ... then move on to autoit or whatever the name was ... there are so many programs and frameworks to work with for bot creation
 MSmits: ahh, well there's probably some helpful tools to interface with those
 firecraftgaming: Were do I see how many times i have won?
 MSmits: won what?
 IfIHadATail: IDK I know Java, some kotlin and some Lua and I am completely lost on the subject lol
 MSmits: clash of code?
 firecraftgaming: won clash of code
 MSmits: dont think you can see it, you can see how many clashes you played, your ranking and rating
 MSmits: also, winning a clash means you're 1st right? But you also gain rating being 2nd, usually
 firecraftgaming: yeah but i want to see my win rate if its possible
 MSmits: or 3rd even
 AntiSquid: you can probably code some bot that looks for specific pixels or icons on the screen to do a nes bot, just google it
 MSmits: winrate is unclear when there's no clear definition of winning
 firecraftgaming: came 1 place
 MSmits: i dont think you can see that
 firecraftgaming: ok thanks anyway
 IfIHadATail: hmm okay I'll look into the pixel thing
 AntiSquid: for browser game bots, there are other tutorials out there, involves a few api calls but not too difficult
 MSmits: don't stare too hard into the pixel thing
 MSmits: it might stare back...
 <b>**MSmits is laughing at his own joke</b></p><p><img src="/a/13660510234542" /> IfIHadATail: also is there terminology I should serch for for stuff like making the game window the active window and stuff like that?
 Uljahn: also look into atari games in Openai gym
 JBM: MSmits: now you get to explain it
 MSmits: no no, that would be a double whammy
 IfIHadATail: lol MSmits
 MSmits: I already laughed at my own joke, if i explain it also, it would be really bad
 IfIHadATail: XD
 IfIHadATail: lol thanks guys I'll start my search again with this new info and motivation. thanks!&#160;: )
 MSmits: have fun&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: MSmits overlooking cellular automata 
 AntiSquid: reply to "msmits laughs at own joke"
 MSmits: I miss the reference&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: stuff like this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/1NYxII0HS9M?t=37">https://youtu.be/1NYxII0HS9M?t=37</a>
 AntiSquid: pixels doing stuff
 MSmits: ahh hright
 AntiSquid: now MSmits feeling unsafe in front of the screen
 MSmits: already was, there's mosquitos 
 MSmits: I have my little electrocution device near me though
 AntiSquid: lol
 MSmits: extremely hot today, left window open too long
 MSmits: also I blame jacek
 AntiSquid: had a bit of rain here
 AntiSquid: jacek's rain dance failed you?
 MSmits: I let my meta mcts too long to beat his bots and thats partially why it's hot
 MSmits: havent tried the dance yet
 MSmits: but it's supposed to rain tomorrow 
 MSmits: :fingers_crossed:
 MSmits: I should finish my floodfill for samegame
 DoxLee: can i share my solution on github&#160;? 
 DoxLee: for puzzles
 MSmits: preferably not
 MSmits: people have done it before and not gotten banned, but you're not really supposed to
 MSmits: it's worse if it's for multiplayer competitive bots, especially if they're good
 MSmits: they lead to multiple players stealing your bot and submitting it
 MSmits: if you do it during a contest you do get disqualified
 DoxLee: i just wanto ask just because i know a guy who is sharing solutions for othersites 
 MSmits: yes it happens
 MSmits: usually the best players dont do it
 MSmits: what i find on google is usually pretty bad, but sure you'll find some easy puzzle solutions and some old bots
 DoxLee: okey u right
 DoxLee: im just braindead for today
 DoxLee: how can i learn how fast my code
 MSmits: how fast?
 DoxLee: y
 DoxLee: performance of code
 DoxLee: sorry for bad english 
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: you mean compared to other players?
 DoxLee: i just want to know which way is better
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: use timing functions
 MSmits: do things in different ways and see which gives a shorter time
 MSmits: each language has its own
 MSmits: timing functions I mean
 MSmits: python -&gt;  import time
 MSmits: C# -&gt; Stopwatch class
 MSmits: etc.
 DoxLee: javscipt :D
 DoxLee: im actually too new for programing
 DoxLee: just 3 month 
 DoxLee: sry for basic questions 
 MSmits: dont know what to do in js, but you can google it
 MSmits: or someone here may tell you
 MSmits: but its quiet time
 DoxLee: thank you 
 DoxLee: may i ask one more questions
 DoxLee: i actually asked :ASDSA
 DoxLee: okey im gone ty :D
 MSmits: you can always ask
 DoxLee: thank you 
 JBM: ok, native anglophones, above &lt;=&gt; hereabove; under &lt;=&gt; hereunder; BENEATH &lt;=&gt;&#160;???
 JBM: strange how there's suddenly no american left despite it being their TZ
 nopnop: hi, i'm new, how can i send a mp to someone&#160;?
 JBM: that's not going to help your newlyness
 SPDene: what's mp?
 nopnop: private message
 JBM: military police
 SPDene: click on their name to open a new tab 
 nopnop: yes but he doesn't speak in the chatroom
 JBM: make him
 SPDene: log on to facebook and message him there instead?
 JBM: what's fb?
 SPDene: foreign body?
 iloveyii: Hi world&#160;!
 JBM: Password:
 SPDene: hunter2
 JBM: oh, stars
 JBM: the usual
 dominggo: &gt;?&lt;
 Andriamanitra: ahhhh why can't it show the title of the clash afterwards
 Andriamanitra: just had another one of these where the test cases don't match validators and now it will forever bother me what i did wrong
 JBM: 1-star rating
 JBM: that'll show it
 Andriamanitra: wdym
 Fougere: Ok anybody know which JS do I kill to get rid of autocomplete please?
 JBM: I wish I knew!
 Gorbit99: there's a css trick apparently, but it didn't work for me specifically
 Gorbit99: test injecting ".editor-widget { display: none; }" into the css
 Gorbit99: Fougere
 Fougere: Doesn’t work for me either, the autocomplete popup doesn’t show up but it does its thing anyway if I press Return.
 Gorbit99: yup, just like me
 Fougere:&#160;:(
 Gorbit99: I'm sure there's a way to kill it, probably with an event or something
 Gorbit99: the editor is called monaco if you want to do some tinkering
 Gorbit99: seems like it uses vscode as the base
 Gorbit99: hmm, apparently setTimeout(() =&gt; editor.trigger(<i>, 'hideSuggestWidget', null)</i>
 Allis: Nice.
 Gorbit99: I'm testing it
 Gorbit99: just have to find out what the editor variable is called
 Always_on_road: I meet a problem, I do not know how to make a security check when join the " clash of code ", is there anyone could help?
 Andriamanitra: you've been exposed as a robot and i'd rather not help your kind to take over the world
 Always_on_road: But why? I just don' t understand 
 tutubalin: Clash of Code is overtaken by bots like BitWolf, Tychkorg, BSoD and others.
 brimonk: Woah, you mean I'm beating bots? Amazing.
 tutubalin: In order to enter CoC you need to prove you are a bot.
 brimonk: wait
 brimonk: uh oh
 jrke: hey you need to prove you are not a bot
 tutubalin: Bots don't like strangers
 tutubalin: So at least you need to pretend you're a bot until they accept you

 ProgrammerDog: Tips and Tricks?
 Andrew_OHara: so what's the threshold for getting hired.. if you can't do the hard puzzles does that mean you're unemployable?
 mzbear: real life programming and puzzles are two entirely different things.  there are many different kind of programming jobs, too
 Andrew_OHara: so, not necessarily unemployable, lol, thanks!
 damnson: no
 SlyisAdam: hey 
 TheSwordBreaker: hi
 Passifi: anyone else feeling stupid when they're stuck on an easy puzzle :sweat:
 proogrmr: me
 jacek: puzzles arent easy or hard. they are easy if you know the algorithm. and hard if you dont know it
 proogrmr:&#160;:\
 jacek: unless you dont know any algorithms...
 SlyisAdam: depends on what you mean y algorithms jack
 SlyisAdam: by*
 SlyisAdam: anyone has  knowledge on django
 SlyisAdam: I could really use some help
 jacek: im bad at pattern matching, which are easy-medium, but i know graph algos which are usually hard but i can do them easily
 jacek: im talking language angostic
 eulerscheZahl: i've played a bit with Django in the past, not really fluent
 SlyisAdam: okay so my issue is when I published my website using heroku which is a free host
 SlyisAdam: apparently heroku cannot serve media and static files 
 SlyisAdam: so sad
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i'm facing the same problem :D
 eulerscheZahl: also with heroku
 ProgrammerDog: :D
 jacek: so its not django?
 SaraPericic: hi everyone
 Leirn: Hi there. I have an issue with Particle Detection with Cloud Chamber. Also all my tests pass, There are only 75% of the validation that are ok (used to be 50%, but I optimised a little since then). But I have no clue what to work on. Radius precision seems good on the test cases.
 Leirn: Test are not very representative on this exercise, it seems...
 Leirn: Any clue&#160;?
 jrke: knock knock MSmits - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/518924299">https://www.codingame.com/replay/518924299</a>
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: the reason you won that is mostly because the controlled score is very close to equal. Then a nimstring analysis is no longer enough
 MSmits: there's no way to force this unless a lot of boxes are sacrificed early
 MSmits: my bot is actually pretty deterministic because i use a fixed seed currently. I have a 80% winrate vs remi with fixed seed and only 60-65% with random seed
 MSmits: if your bot consistently wins like that, I will switch to random seed
 MSmits: then every game is completely different and most will have lopsided scores
 MSmits: 33-16 etc.
 MSmits: if that's not enough it's time to get back to codin':)
 MSmits: but I'm curious to know what you're doing jrke, if you have anything to share
 MSmits: I notice your bot gives numbers that in the end become your net-score. Is this the result of a solver? It changes a lot
 jrke: yes thats why i said many bugs to solve cause solver score changes a lot
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jrke: i think that was a random win with many bugs but still its a win
 MSmits: the reason it was a win is like this
 MSmits: my bot only solves in the endgame currently
 MSmits: and before the end game it attempts to gain control
 MSmits: but sometimes the person who has control still loses
 jrke: i have an unoptimized endgame solver with random moves before endgame
 MSmits: ah ok
 jrke: "but sometimes the person who has control still loses" - when sacrifises are more
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i should extend my solver a few turns before the endgame, should be easily possible
 MSmits: then it may happen less
 MSmits: but thats a lot of work, i want to wait till someone beats me to get some motivation&#160;:)
 jrke: btw what is logic of your endgame solver if you wanna share..
 MSmits: i dont mind sharing but it's a lot
 MSmits: 1500 lines or so
 MSmits: it's basically a negamax that maximizes score
 MSmits: if you're in control, it does two types of moves: 1) keeping control or 2) taking all the boxes
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: when it's not in control, it picks a string to open
 MSmits: so an isolated chain or loop, or a string connected to one of the many joints
 MSmits: the trick is not really to make it work, but to make it fast
 MSmits: for example, when picking an isolated chain, there's never any reason to pick a larger one when there's a smaller one available
 MSmits: same for isolated loops
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: also i have a function that immediately calculates the end result of a simple loony game
 MSmits: which means only isolated chains and loops
 MSmits: (o joints)
 MSmits: 0
 MSmits: so when the negamax gets down to that position, it immediately ends
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: there's papers you can find this in
 MSmits: PLAYING SIMPLE LOONY DOTS-AND-BOXES ENDGAMESOPTIMALLY.
 MSmits: Kevin Buzzard
 jrke: okaye
 MSmits: it looks really complicated, but you dont need the proofs
 MSmits: just the theorems.
 MSmits: also, you need to get familiar with the notation and lingo
 MSmits: that takes time
 MSmits: took me a week of reading various papers until i got what all the words mean
 MSmits: an hour two a day or so, in the train, before sleep etc.
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: anyways, the non-isolated part is the complex part
 jrke: yup understandable
 MSmits: there are a few rules you can use to make it simpler
 jrke: btw map reprenstion looks good
 MSmits: for example, a joint may have various strings coming from it, that are only connected to that joint and otherwise isolated (so they connect to the border)
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1df9eb0-1d15-4732-b052-ade6d65c8302">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1df9eb0-1d15-4732-b052-ade6d65c8302</a>
 MSmits: yeah looks cool
 MSmits: as for that joint, if it has multiple strings connected to it, that are otherwise isolated, dont pick a 5 length one before a 3 length one
 MSmits: for that particular joint that is
 MSmits: exception to this rule is the short ones
 MSmits: 1 and 2
 MSmits: sometimes its better to pick a long one (3+) before a short one (1/2), if they are connected to joints 
 MSmits: because joints merge when they go down to 2 connected
 jrke: very complex
 MSmits: and that can affect who is in control
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: the way i did this is, at first allow everything
 MSmits: which makes the negamax extremely slow
 MSmits: get 10k testcases or more
 MSmits: try a pruning rule
 MSmits: if one of the 10k testcases gives a different result with that rule, then the rule is no good
 MSmits: it's a good way to experiment
 MSmits: you can get more and more rules without changing the end result
 MSmits: just be careful, some rules will cause an error in very rare cases. Also use your brain 
 jrke: btw gtg cya
 MSmits: cya 
 AI_says_hi: "Also use your brain " - now thats solid advice&#160;;-)
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 jacek: N/A for me&#160;:(
 MSmits: you don't need brain, you create brain
 Westicles: nicely used brain to constrate
 Astrobytes: That comment will never get old.
 MSmits: hi guys
 MSmits: finally done with all my work stuff, now starting my boardgame demo for my study credits
 Astrobytes: oh cool, still going with Y?
 MSmits: I have been thinking about maybe gomoku
 MSmits: it's not that different
 MSmits: it's squares and it's 5 in a row
 Astrobytes: would also be cool, yeah
 Astrobytes: It's your project, so have some fun with it&#160;;)
 MSmits: right, i just have to be careful not to spend too much time on it
 MSmits: it's supposed to be a small demo
 MSmits: at least the AI part will be easy, i can just paste in any random minimax
 MSmits: or mcts, or whatever
 Astrobytes: I can imagine everyone submitting a rolling ball, and you submit a fully-polished complete game.
 MSmits: this is nice:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/part-1/">https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/part-1/</a>
 MSmits: specifically for unity
 MSmits: yeah thats the idea
 Astrobytes: oh, catlikecoding again
 MSmits: i just googled hex board unity
 jacek: hexify everything
 MSmits: what i like about catlike coding is that he resisted the urge to put everything in videos. I hate that
 MSmits: just let me read and copy paste
 jacek: :cat:
 MSmits: :smiley_cat:
 zhoubou: :cat2:
 eulerscheZahl: :frog:
 MSmits: c-c-c combobreaker
 MSmits: what are you working on euler?
 eulerscheZahl: polishing up the secret game and coders of the realm 1vs1
 MSmits: coders of the realm is a bot, but is secret game one of your creations or?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: is it called the secret game or is it just secret?
 eulerscheZahl: just not published yet
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: am I going to like it?
 eulerscheZahl: still hopes for a community contest. i wait until my dŕeams get destroyed before publishing
 MSmits: ahh ok, makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: future will tell if you like it
 MSmits: hope they consider it seriously. You have a good track record
 eulerscheZahl: you'll get a chance to see it. just not sure about the circumstances
 MSmits: yeah, i'll wait
 eulerscheZahl: only thing i'm willing to tell: my own idea, not porting an existing game
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: nice
 eulerscheZahl: or a bad sign, you'll find out&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's riskier, but you're a good botter. A good way to test it is to create various types of bots and try them out
 eulerscheZahl: burnout risk detected
 MSmits: sure, but seeing how quickly you burn out on this game is also a test
 jacek: does it contain hexes?
 eulerscheZahl: i usually lose interest in my games when the referee is done already
 eulerscheZahl: :zipper_mouth:
 MSmits: test if you can hold interest for longer than 2 days. If you can do that, many will keep going for 10
 Astrobytes: Multidimensional hexes
 eulerscheZahl: contest is just very different
 eulerscheZahl: everyone improving vs testing in the void
 MSmits: all hexes are multidimensional
 MSmits: they require at least 2
 Astrobytes: (I realise that)
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: I was implying greater than 2 :P
 MSmits: aha
 eulerscheZahl: wouldn't that cause gaps?
 darkhorse64:  I finally give 2048 a serious try (beam search + snake pattern) but I am stuck: I need to output more moves but increasing the depth leads me more frequently to dead ends.
 MSmits: well you can't make a sphere out of hexes
 MSmits: unless you have 1 5 sided
 Astrobytes: Most likely. You'd have to tile using other polygons
 eulerscheZahl: :soccer:
 MSmits: not one, 12 even

 cjz: whats up
 eulerscheZahl: i think the movement concept is interesting: you have dice that you can roll (also around the corner)
 <b>**MSmits points up</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: that way
 eulerscheZahl: and you go by as many cells as the dice shows initially
 MSmits: looks interesting
 Astrobytes: Haven't seen that before.
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like the final idea (get 3 sequential numbers in a row with 1 dice being the opponent)
 eulerscheZahl: just capturing the opponent might be more interesting
 eulerscheZahl: as that 3 in a row would possibly result in a very defensive gameplay
 MSmits: i just realized something
 MSmits: a 3d hexagon is just a cube
 MSmits: so yeah, thats minecraft
 eulerscheZahl: a cube is a 3D square
 MSmits: matter of definition, a cube has 6 sides, just like a hexagon&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :D

 MSmits: weird
 eulerscheZahl: a hypercube
 MSmits: 4D cube?
 eulerscheZahl: that's how i understand it. but don't quote me on it
 MSmits: or is it hyper because it cant stop moving?
 jacek: its rotating
 Counterbalance: omg! it's full of cubes!
 Westicles: yep, you can rotate your left foot into your right foot
 MSmits: not me
 jacek: too old?
 eulerscheZahl: too few dimensions
 eulerscheZahl: Futurama had a 4D episode: Möbius Dick
 Astrobytes: That title :rofl:
 jacek: i remember they went to 2 and pi dimension
 eulerscheZahl: but eating in 2D was a real issue

 jrke: looks i have fixed my endgame solver but needs a lot optimization at the moment
 eulerscheZahl: "CodinGame Clash of Code (with piano sound on every keystroke)"that livestream title :rofl:
 jrke: anybody having tips for optimizing or pruning minimax tree except alpha - beta
 MSmits: using transposition tables
 MSmits: re-using already calculated results
 jrke: yes
 MSmits: well thats a tip
 jrke: resusing calculated result but what is transpotion table?
 MSmits: say you get to the same game state via a different route
 MSmits: the value of that gamestate is still the same
 jrke: oh 
 MSmits: and you already calculated it
 jrke: yes thats there
 MSmits: you mean you're using it already?
 MSmits: many of the other improvements to negamax/minimax are not applicable to a full-depth solver
 jrke: yes i am using already calculated result
 MSmits: assuming that is what you're working on
 MSmits: usually you re-use information from earlier iterations in iterative minimax, but a solver goes full depth anyway
 MSmits: so there is only 1 iteration
 jrke: my solver is not able to solve a game under 100ms if there are more than 5-6 chains
 jrke: oh waiit i am not using those results all times
 MSmits: be careful reusing though, there's some question about alpha and beta when you do this
 MSmits: sec, let me share something
 jrke: when i have to reduce value only then using alpha beta
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf">https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf</a>
 MSmits: this has sample code for alpha beta pruning combined with transposition tables
 MSmits: it's a bit complicated, involving upper and lower bounds to the score
 MSmits: but i just stole the code
 MSmits: I use a 100k sized hashtable to put calculated scores in
 jrke: thats good book for my age as i am a new to coding

 reCurse: Msmithief
 jrke: looks transposition tables can save my solver from timeouts
 MSmits: thats right reCurse&#160;:)
 MSmits: jrke, you also need a ton of pruning, TT alone wont be enough for the most complicated states
 MSmits: like ones with 12 joints
 reCurse: Transposition tables can also be useless, it depends on the game
 MSmits: yeah, mostly they are useless, but not in this case
 MSmits: about pruning. I have so much pruning i ran out of proper descriptive names
 MSmits: look at this function:
 jrke: ^^
 reCurse: Which case is this
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5e56833-57fe-4b1c-b05b-2337ae97377a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5e56833-57fe-4b1c-b05b-2337ae97377a</a>
 MSmits: a solver for dots and boxes endgames
 MSmits: it's a full depth solver, which is a reason why TT works
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/dots-and-boxes</a>- this case reCurse
 reCurse: Going hardcore on D&amp;B eh?
 MSmits: not me, that's jrke
 MSmits: I'm already nr 1
 Astrobytes: ShortestGroundedLongStringWithNoShortAndNoDouble is the greatest.
 reCurse: Maybe you should write the whole documentation in the function name
 MSmits: hehe
 jrke: MS whats your soler's response time
 MSmits: 1 ms for the average endgame, 1 in a million games goes over 100 ms
 jrke: lol
 reCurse: How big is your D&amp;B opening book
 MSmits: dont have one
 reCurse: :o
 MSmits: it plays random moves for 55 plies
 jrke: playing fair endgame is top 3 reCurse
 MSmits: then uses nimstring analyis till endgame
 MSmits: then solves endgame
 jrke: wala pushed me 4th yesterday
 MSmits: i say random moves till 55, but i really mean, until the nimstring analysis resolves 
 MSmits: it varies
 darkhorse64: There is an incoming Connect4 for you to build an opening book
 MSmits: we already have connect 4
 jrke: Connect 4 i think can be harcoded
 darkhorse64: Not a struct demo. It's 7x9 board harder to solve
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: mmh shouldnt it be even bigger?
 reCurse: Let's go with 18x19 to be safe.
 MSmits: 7x9 sounds like something i can solve locally
 jrke: ^
 MSmits: would make it really easy to create an opening book
 darkhorse64: It's on the contribution page. 7x9 is solved as win for white but you will have a hard time computing the solution in 100 ms
 reCurse: Start playing suboptimally to beat MSmits
 Astrobytes: 18x19 it is then.
 MSmits: there are way more complicated games, such as oware where bots already play near perfectly
 jrke: my current plan to work on D&amp;B -Optimize endgams solver-&gt;Make something for few turns before endgame-&gt;Something for early game then 10 points lead from MS&#160;;)
 MSmits: hehe i hope you succeed, i need new motivation to get back in there
 MSmits: I still have 3 ideas, but they are all a lot of work
 jrke: MS btw you have now 0 loses in your battles history
 MSmits: cool
 jrke: gtg for sleep bye gn
 MSmits: gn
 Astrobytes: gn
 darkhorse64: re 7x9 I suggested to the author to change the shape from rectangle to octagon but he chose to enlarge the board
 MSmits: he should add a new feature
 MSmits: like gravity shift
 jrke: make it 7*1 all draws 1st ranker leave tottaly on trueskill randomness lol
 Astrobytes: re Connect4: Needs moar FOW
 darkhorse64: Anyway, it's a simple game that may attract more people
 MSmits: yeah, it's fine, as long as he doesnt make it completely solvable
 Astrobytes: I still think a 'nursery' area where you can practice techniques on simple/solved games would be cool.
 darkhorse64: It's solved but it requires tons of memory and CPU time to reach the solution
 MSmits: how much memory?
 MSmits: do you mean HD storage or RAM?
 MSmits: awari fits in 900 GB or so
 MSmits: but thats HD space, too slow for the actual solving process

 MSmits: hmm yeah I like it
 MSmits: i guess this amount is fine
 reCurse: Interesting how it's sometimes P1 win and sometimes P2 win
 MSmits: same with D&amp;B at different sizes
 MSmits: it's a nim-thing I think. The person who is forced to move and give away the game loses
 jacek: full moon is so beautiful today
 MSmits: :wolf: AROOOOO!
 jacek: we have 100ms for connect4, yet 50ms for chess
 struct: Well, you can blame no mirror matches for that one
 reCurse: If chess games were guaranteed to finish in 42 moves it would be a different story.
 jacek: and i agree - it would be nice to have more easy, solved games, to try difference approaches than brute force
 jacek: afaik there was (is?) othello league with 1-ply search and 10% random moves
 jacek: just to fiddle with evaluations
 XIlayPVPX: yo wtf there's a chat
 jacek: oO
 XIlayPVPX: anyhow just did the first puzzle, are all puzzles just different sorting algorithms? or does it get spicier

 jacek: there are various puzzles. pattern matching, numbers, graph theory, search...
 struct: it gets harder
 XIlayPVPX: I did the spaceship puzzle thingy
 XIlayPVPX: saw it had 440k completions so I thought it's good
 XIlayPVPX: was actually quite refreshing
 struct: its the tutorial
 XIlayPVPX: yup
 XIlayPVPX: the first one
 VizGhar: tutorials tends to be very very easy
 XIlayPVPX: gotta take them baby steps ya know
 XIlayPVPX: xD
 VizGhar: so brace yourself
 XIlayPVPX: o dang O_O
 XIlayPVPX: which one do I go for? Clash of code, AI or Algorithms?
 XIlayPVPX: what's more newbie friendly
 struct: puzzles
 XIlayPVPX: kk
 XIlayPVPX: I'll do 2 more 
 VizGhar: maybe even CoC (if you won't get frustrated from losing a lot)
 XIlayPVPX: I'll do that one after completing 2 more puzzles xD
 XIlayPVPX: doesn't sound too friendly if I'm honest
 jacek: mos clashes are newbie friendly but have 15 minutes to complee
 VizGhar: If you won't take a screenshot&#160;:)
 jacek: and wheres my T
 XIlayPVPX: are you guys here to practice? or is it for fun, I was wondering what people's goals are
 jacek: for fun, mostly multiplayer games
 reCurse: According to experience, trolling
 XIlayPVPX: xD
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 XIlayPVPX: Are you guys somewhat interested / already invested in a career that requires programming?
 jacek: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: But fun and learning for me.
 XIlayPVPX: Or is the majority here just a bunch of students
 Astrobytes: There's a mixture of both, probably more of the former?
 XIlayPVPX: Interesting...
 Astrobytes: And some are just hobbyists.
 XIlayPVPX: Well, it feels kinda nice to be here, Ima go back to doing puzzles.Cya&#160;:)

 ImperialGold: can I ask how people end up with a less than 100% before time is up? Do they give up or just not test it first?

 zhoubou: :hand_splayed:
 Astrobytes: hey zhoubou, everything OK after the earthquake?
 zhoubou: Yeah, we had good luck. Can't say the same for some people.
 zhoubou: We are still afraid of aftershocks.
 Astrobytes: Yes, it was pretty destructive from what I've seen
 zhoubou: Yeah, Petrinja, Glina, and surrounding areas got devestated.
 zhoubou: It didn't hit quite as hard here in Zagreb.
 zhoubou: Thanks for caring.
 Astrobytes: Such a terrible thing. I wish you all good luck, I hope any subsequent aftershocks will only be mild
 zhoubou: Thanks.
 zhoubou: It means a lot
 Astrobytes: You're most welcome. We're all humans here.
 zhoubou: We are, aren't we.&#160;:)

 VizGhar: I have it solved in 3 languages, but dang that clojure
 struct: just looking at syntax
 struct: I think it would take me like a day
 VizGhar: hate those language specific achievements... I'll die solving nintendo
 Westicles: Some of those weird languages are tough to even google.  Half the stuff that comes up is obsolete with a new version
 XIlayPVPX: Literally I can't do clashes with C#
 XIlayPVPX: 1 line of code counts are 300+ characters because of previous references that are a must in C#
 XIlayPVPX: there's always that guy with Javascript that writes his code in 20 characters
 XIlayPVPX: counts as*
 MSmits: XIlayPVPX dont do them in C#
 the0val: and then the guy in python, has one line of wierd symbols that noone can understand
 MSmits: it's typical to do them in python as many players have knowledge of python
 MSmits: but there are multiple languages where short solutions are possible
 MSmits: just use a language suited for the job
 struct: ruby or perl or bash
 struct: if you want to win shortest
 the0val: really bash?
 MSmits: python works fine too
 VizGhar: yup... I was forced to switch language (from kotlin to ruby - it is even more concise) in order to get higher
 MSmits: unless you're up against a really good clasher
 struct: not well enough
 VizGhar: yeah perl is great too
 MSmits: well enough to win often
 IfIHadATail: nice part about shortest code is thst you can utilize all your time to look thigs up

 Stilgart: MadKnight: let(s spam #world then
 MadKnight: hey Stilgart
 MadKnight: do u remember anything what happened in #world Stilgart&#160;?
 Stilgart: nope, I d'ont read #world that much actually
 MadKnight: PERFECT
 MadKnight: just don't think about it
 MadKnight: and let's talk about some bots
 MadKnight: Stilgart have u recently worked on some bots&#160;?
 Stilgart: last time was FC2020
 MadKnight: and how did it go&#160;?
 MadKnight: oh the game with the witches
 Stilgart: I did fix my CotC a little after that, but nothing exiting (still gold)
 MadKnight: but what was your approach&#160;?
 MadKnight: that's the most interesting part Stilgart
 Stilgart: top gold during the contest, pushed legend a few day later thanks to massive bad BS implementations from others
 MadKnight: but what was your main algo&#160;?
 Stilgart: my CotC is pure Monte Carlo
 MadKnight: oog
 Stilgart: my FC is a BFS
 MadKnight: ooh
 MadKnight: wait so CotC is....
 Stilgart: beber told me to do a MC at CotC, so I did it :D
 MSmits: that beber
 MadKnight: Code of the Challenge
 MSmits: coders of the carribean
 MadKnight: oh right
 Stilgart: yep, I was still top silver for no good reason
 Stilgart: so i fixed a bug and now i am gold
 MSmits: so what are you working on now Stilgart
 MSmits: oh still cotc
 MadKnight: yeee i remember that one i don't wanna even see the code i wrote for that one i just wanna destroy iy
 MadKnight: it
 Stilgart: i should work on an internal contest
 MSmits: i need to get a reasonable bot for that one of these days
 MadKnight: yea u two talk
 MadKnight: i brb
 Stilgart: but I do not have that much time to do so
 MSmits: what internal contest is that?
 Stilgart: something for our students that mouton5000 made
 MSmits: ah cool
 MSmits: you dont want to lose to your students
 Stilgart: finding thieves in a hotel... it might be converted as a multi on CG, but I need to convince him first
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well he might want to use it again
 MSmits: for another internal
 Stilgart: well... i am still in the middle with a full random bot
 Stilgart: not so motivating yet
 MSmits: you can do a lot better
 Stilgart: the main issue is porting the rendering part (which is time consuming)
 Stilgart: but my C is rusty
 Stilgart: (and no way i am doing it in python)
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: so this is not on CG platform?
 Stilgart: nope
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Stilgart: it is on an internal server
 MSmits: I see
 Westicles: I've been making quite a few puzzles myself.  Pretty fun
 Westicles: But I'm no good at judging difficulty
 clemg: damn apilat
 clemg: you fast
 DJSchaffner: that moment when you are in a clash, cant think straight and try to split a string into words, then try to split the words into letters instead of just iterating over the string in the first place
 DJSchaffner: off
 DJSchaffner: oof*
 VizGhar: fixing off to oof&#160;:) you are tired, go sleep
 MSmits: hey struct, finally got the yavalath board into unity
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/ptgZZz3">https://imgur.com/a/ptgZZz3</a>
 struct: Nice
 MSmits: i made each hex into a mesh, i can select them by raycasting. Overkill to use unity for this but ok
 VizGhar: 5@#Q#Y% CLOJURE #$@%
 MSmits: ill make little black ridges on top to differentiate i think
 VizGhar: good night
 struct: gn
 MSmits: gn VizGhar
 struct: yeah the lines to separate it look better
 struct: imo
 MSmits: not sure how to do it without textures, so i'll just make a giant ridge-mesh
 MSmits: and overlay it
 MSmits: or i guess i could also shrink the hexes a little bit and put it in between, might be better
 MSmits: but thats for tomorrow, gonna call it a day. Gn!

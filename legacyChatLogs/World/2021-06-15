 emh: the lemire alternative
 sprkrd: the world of prng is such a rabbit hole that you'd better off starting a wiki :joy:
 sprkrd: (kidding, it's cool to have you own playground)

 sprkrd: oh, hell
 sprkrd: you beat me to it
 sprkrd: i was looking for that link, too
 emh: kk added link to article
 derjack: oO
 derjack: yeah keep adding random links to random article
 sprkrd: one of these will be a link to a porn site, and you won't even notice :clown:
 derjack: prng :thinking:
 sprkrd: :O
 sprkrd: The levenshtein distance between porn and prng is very small, also
 emh: hehe
 Coder-Thor: nice emh
 struct: hi
 emh: hi struct
 Coder-Thor: hii struct bro
 JimmyJams: dude like 1/8 clashes have broken validators
 JimmyJams: is there a forum or something we can ask them to check validators before submitting
 JimmyJams: clearly we cannot trust the community to properly vet these clashes, people seem to not understand validators must be very similar to the test cases
 PoopyCoder123: what are validators? Sorry noob here
 PoopyCoder123: Are they the thing that check test cases
 JimmyJams: when you submit a puzzle there are tests you can see when you go to submit, and then tests that are invisible.
 JimmyJams: the invisible ones are validators
 JimmyJams: they prevent people from hard-coding answers
 theonlyjt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/defining-test-cases">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/defining-test-cases</a>
 sprkrd: JimmyJams May I ask in good faith, are you 100% positive the validators are wrong and it's not that you've failed to account for some edge case?
 struct: some clashes have bad test cases
 struct: Happened to me before
 sprkrd: I thought moderators were supposed to code their own solution before approving a contribution
 sprkrd: that way the can spot bad test cases too
 LeviathanProgramming: sometimes it's because the creator of the contribution make an algorithm with an unexpected output
 LeviathanProgramming: or just one that is a wierd function
 sprkrd: but that should be caught by the moderators if they try to solve the problem themselves, right?
 derjack: its up to contribution reviewers
 struct: derjack is your C4 a NN?
 sprkrd: but what's a review worth if the test cases are not checked...
 Uljahn: low quality of clash approval process shouldn't be a surprize though
 sprkrd: reviews shouldn't be just "hey, it's a cool idea! go ahead!"
 derjack: struct yes
 struct: ok im gonna add the new features to get rank 2
 struct: hopefully
 derjack: i dont see you in the leaderboard
 struct: 3rd
 derjack: new account?
 struct: its old but yes
 derjack: so it is old account or new account :no_mouth:
 struct: just another account
 derjack: and what are those new features could be
 struct: reuse tree, take into account that opponent can steal, and fix some bugs
 struct: use full time on turn 1
 struct: also dont play on middle cell&#160;:)
 derjack: omg you play middle and some people dont steal it
 struct: yes lol
 derjack: and tree reuse is quite handy here
 Marchete: submit to be 2nd, nulte
 struct: soon
 darkhorse64: no&#160;!
 darkhorse64: :grin:
 Marchete: now?
 darkhorse64: :thumbsup:
 Marchete: it's kind of late
 struct: at least now its finding move 3 as the strongest move on first turn
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b891dd8-9772-4d45-a490-7af019d5d163">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b891dd8-9772-4d45-a490-7af019d5d163</a>
 derjack: whats with the 6
 struct: what do you mean?
 derjack: oh, stupid scientific notation
 Marchete: no symmetry?
 Marchete: seems weird to me
 struct: nope
 Marchete: why?
 struct: ill just hardcode first move anyways
 struct: hardcode and force the expansion on it
 Marchete: I'll just copy your first moves
 Marchete: and good to go
 struct: so root will only have one child
 struct: do you steal every move unless its 0 darkhorse64?
 derjack: :moneybag:
 Marchete: :spy_tone3:
 Marchete: will you pick the best move or the nearest to 50%?
 derjack: why would he pick the best move
 Marchete: because he assumes he can beat anyone even with steal
 ayoubft: how to change programming languages in my profile&#160;??
 struct: oh no i had massive bug lol
 Marchete: and 3rd?
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/563927081">https://www.codingame.com/replay/563927081</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/563927130">https://www.codingame.com/replay/563927130</a>  same replays eh
 struct: yes
 struct: if opp stole
 Marchete: :expressionless:
 struct: my cell would sitll have the piece there
 struct: lol
 struct: I mean both pieces would be there :D
 Marchete: don't you have an owner's mask?
 struct: no
 struct: i have boards[2]
 derjack: ayoubft its about solving puzzles in language
 Marchete: ouch
 Marchete: pretty epic fail then
 derjack: it would suck for win detection wouldnt it
 Marchete: it seems one of mine
 struct: yes derjack
 Marchete: then it's time to resubmit
 derjack: that could make nice variant though, an universal disc
 ayoubft: yes that's why I have tried my first challenge in js, and it is the language in my profile, but m=now I am coding in python, but not visible on my profile yet 
 derjack: maybe it updates once a day :thinking:
 CatLocked: isn't it unbalanced for some language in shortest mode?
 Nekko551XD: that makes you learn more languages 
 darkhorse64: struct: yes but I have no clue whether stealing 1 and 7 is good
 derjack: could be. if you steal, 2 player's tree reuse will be smaller no?
 darkhorse64: larger because he started exploring the move and he is getting 100ms more to explore the same move
 darkhorse64: but you have the initiative
 derjack: oh
 derjack: then dont steal ~
 struct: so many little bugs 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 darkhorse64: everybody wishes top 3 with bugs
 derjack: but if he fixes them he wont be in top3 anymore
 struct: maybe
 darkhorse64: that's my only hope
 struct: i finally started winning some games vs you :p
 darkhorse64: last night submit was 50%
 struct: yeah but i had a lose because i was p1
 struct: p1 and steal = lose for me
 struct: with current arena bot
 darkhorse64: Yeah, that one was quick
 mohandas: muchend hogale:rage:
 derjack: oO
 mkxd990: &amp;
 Marchete: just submit struct
 Marchete: with that bugfix it may be 2nd
 struct: dont think it can get 2nd first
 struct: I dont reuse tree yet
 derjack: can it get 1st second
 Marchete: you can't know if you don't submit
 struct: ill submit anyways
 derjack: :tada:
 struct: maybe i have more bugs i cant find
 Marchete: soon?
 struct: I just did
 Marchete: ahh :D
 struct: well afk for a while
 Marchete: I don't understand why nulte and not struc_t
 Marchete: like&#160;????
 derjack: so he can delete not main account
 Marchete: Smits +4pts difference
 derjack: book* +4pts difference
 Marchete: well, &lt;insert_legal_winning_strategy&gt; +4pts
 pop223: hey how do i make a game
 Marchete: 0% winrate vs Smits, struct
 emh: Today I Learned: that ginger contains gingerols with a similar structure to capsaicin, and that mustard contains allyl isothiocyanate, also in wasabi and horseradish
 emh: was wondering what makes different foods spicy, so I googled
 derjack: noice struct, 2nd
 struct: nice
 struct: :D
 struct: now i must reuse the tree :p
 struct: I cant beat msmits though
 struct: and I dont feel like making a book
 darkhorse64: still that insane number of smart rollouts&#160;? The only way I can reach that number is to make them dumb
 Marchete: congrats
 struct: thanks
 struct: darkhorse64 they are not fully smart
 struct: on rollout i dont check for moves that create a win for opponent
 struct: I check for cells that can prevent opponent from winning
 struct: but blocking that cell could create another win
 struct: my rollout doesnt take that into account
 struct: so they are half smart
 struct: with fully smart rollouts i get a little bit less, i need to check if its worth
 darkhorse64: so you need to check for wins for you and for winning moves for the opponent. 
 struct: maybe tomorrow ill have time to work on it
 struct: yes
 darkhorse64: I guess you can get fully smart with no loss
 struct: well they are slightly heavier
 darkhorse64: you remove a win check and you add a quicker test
 pop223: does anyone know if i can make a game
 emh: connect4. C4.. sooner or later that's gonna blow up on someone. combinatorial explosion they'll say
 darkhorse64: pop223:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/why-contribute">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/why-contribute</a>
 struct: darkhorse it ends up being heavier because the game lasts longer 
 struct: Also I will probably change to single rollout
 struct: So I expand the tree more to solver sooner
 struct: ill try both ways
 darkhorse64: good point
 SummerCool: Hello guys 
 ButtSmasher: HI kings
 LLamperouge: hi 
 struct: you won vs msmits darkhorse o.o
 jacek: lets save the replay
 jacek: and show to grandchildren
 darkhorse64: dumb rollouts submit, just to see the difference
 struct: it seems to get stuck
 struct: the submit
 darkhorse64: I use all extra ms
 struct: you use 100?
 darkhorse64: I jailbreaked CG
 struct: ah lol
 darkhorse64: Yes, I do. Leaving on the edge
 struct: i tried reusing the tree
 struct: but it caused bugs
 darkhorse64: What's your pool size&#160;?
 struct: 45'000'000
 struct: i dont use it all obviously
 struct: I think
 struct: :thinking:
 darkhorse64: no bugs from reusing the nodes, then
 struct: ill report the submit bug on discord
 struct: ill be back later to fix the bot
 olaf_surgut: had anyone done puzzle of the week?
 Nekko551XD: read discussion 
 Nekko551XD: one comment will lead you to solution and it's surprisingly easy after it  
 olaf_surgut: hmm
 olaf_surgut: i solved it with dijsktra, but instread of compressing the coordinates i make graph made with rectangle vertexes
 Nekko551XD: my mistake actually i thought on last puzzle of the week 
 Nekko551XD: so my comment is useless XD
 Marchete: set parent to null if you have it struct
 Marchete: and debug it
 Marchete: maybe the problem is how you keep the children
 Marchete: maybe overlaps?
 Marchete: but 45M is unlikely
 Smelty: im tryna do the weekly puzzle

 Westicles: It usually works, but for the last months three indian guys have been approving everything
 Westicles: *month
 Wontonimo: what kind of Indian?  From India or First Nations North America?
 Wontonimo: what?  Codingame hasn't made an algorithm to detect voting parties?  Weird.
 Wontonimo: it's not like it would be as simple as you can't vote on the the same thing with the same people in the same month
 Westicles: Well, there is a guy who's fulltime job is to oversee this stuff

 Stormalix: for JavaScript.. does anyone know why the arrays inside of Array(n).fill([]) are treated as one? I tried pushing an element into the first array and it was pushed into every array..
 DaNinja: fill() passes a reference
 DaNinja: try this instead
 DaNinja: Array(10).fill().map(u=&gt;[])
 Stormalix: oh wow thanks lol it works
 Stormalix: what do you mean by passes a reference?
 ZarthaxX: it points to the same memory space
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68a57858-cd91-4163-82ad-90eee8902657">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/68a57858-cd91-4163-82ad-90eee8902657</a>
 ZarthaxX: oh well lol
 ZarthaxX: likea = []b = a
 ZarthaxX: now b points to same object as a, which is the []
 ZarthaxX: Stormalix
 Stormalix: ohhhhh
 nulte: hi ZarthaxX&#160;:)
 Stormalix: so it's more like a=[[],(a[0]),(a[0])]
 ZarthaxX: hey nulte&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: Stormalix what
 nulte: managed to get rank 2 on c4 
 ZarthaxX: i mean its like this Stormalix
 ZarthaxX: Array(n).fill([])  equals
 nulte: after being pushed by msmits
 ZarthaxX: a = []Array(n).fill(a) 
 ZarthaxX: so you got [a,a,...,a,a] 
 Stormalix: huh so it's all the same array
 ZarthaxX: nulte holy fuck thats nice :O
 ZarthaxX: Stormalix right so you modify one you modify all
 Stormalix: smh that's weird
 struct: thanks
 ZarthaxX: it could be avoided if the fill made a copy each time it added one element to array
 ZarthaxX: but well
 ZarthaxX: it doesnt
 ZarthaxX: i will go eat now
 Stormalix: so if i filled a with 1 and added to element 0 then everything would change to 2?
 struct: enjoy
 ZarthaxX: no
 ZarthaxX: Stormalix there are primitives
 ZarthaxX: numbers are primitives
 Stormalix: oh
 Stormalix: hshshs im not familiar with terminology
 ZarthaxX: so having a=  1
 ZarthaxX: b = a
 ZarthaxX: makes b be equal to 1, it doesnt point to anything
 ZarthaxX: just google try it
 ZarthaxX: [] is an object
 Stormalix: hm yes
 ZarthaxX: so if you assign a=[],  a is just a REFERENCE to that object
 ZarthaxX: it doesnt contain the value itself
 ZarthaxX: but a=1 does
 ZarthaxX: because 1 is a primitive
 ZarthaxX: that's why it works for one and not for the other
 ZarthaxX: anyway will be back later
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 struct: later
 Stormalix: hmmmm i think i understand it now
 Jakaria: yo
 Jakaria: i need a little advice
 Jakaria: you guys use reduce, fill, map functions and stuffs like crazy
 Jakaria: how do i easily learn these magical functions?
 DaNinja: solve the puzzles here with standard for loops, then look at other folks solutions to see great examples how to use reduce, map etc
 Jakaria: ah i see
 Jakaria: thanks
 Jakaria: any other advice?
 DaNinja: google javascript map foreach reduce filter
 DaNinja: theres plenty of tutorials out there
 DaNinja: then practice here
 MadKnight: anyone ever worked with G-API before&#160;?
 willdoescode: they have a chat here
 MadKnight: i wanted to use my dummy's free bit of cloud drive space to store some data from my app but it seems that i'm gonna have to manually allow my app to have access to this dummy acc from the dummy acc using the app
 MadKnight: i mean google drive api
 MadKnight: yea i know noone ever tried using excel tables to store database data
 MadKnight: but still
 borrel: you should be able to create a "server key" with "offline" access in the api console
 MadKnight: nonono that's not the problem
 MadKnight: the problem is
 MadKnight: to get access to a user account u gotta give the user this weird "do you allow this app to access this stuff?" page
 MadKnight: and the user has to manually press "yes"
 MadKnight: just like the "login using google account" thing
 MadKnight: i got the key and stuff
 borrel: using the "offline" feature of OpenID
 MadKnight: what's that
 borrel: you should be albe to store a token for the user
 borrel: aka only has to aprove once
 MadKnight: "to approve once"
 MadKnight: that's what i'm talking about
 borrel: not sure if you can do it from inside drive tho
 MadKnight: if it's my own account too how do i get the approvement without implementing the standard "do you allow this app to do this stuff?" procedure&#160;?
 borrel: but if you are calling drive form a server it sould be easy
 MadKnight: yes but only after u got the approvement
 MadKnight: the problem is getting the dummy user account to let the program to have access
 MadKnight: without having it to manually click "allow"
 borrel: here
 borrel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#exchange-authorization-code">https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#exchange-authorization-code</a>
 borrel: access_type needs ofline for that
 borrel: *offline
 MadKnight: well so in a few words
 MadKnight: how does it work? starting from step 1
 MadKnight: i mean if i have the login &amp; pass
 MadKnight: because it's my dummy account
 borrel: 1. gen auth url and open2. athenticate in popup3. store offline tokens 
 borrel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/">https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/</a>
 borrel: try the playground
 MadKnight: &gt; 2. athenticate in popup
 MadKnight: dude
 QuickMathzs: e
 QuickMathzs: more like
 QuickMathzs: e
 MadKnight: that's exactly what i was talking about
 MadKnight: how can i avoid the popup for the user if it's my own acc&#160;?
 MadKnight: and he's the only one i'm gonna have to auth
 MadKnight: he's the only one i wanna auth and i don't wanna auth anyone else
 borrel: just store the auth code and implement refresh with the POST /token HTTP/1.1
 borrel: From the playground
 MadKnight: wat
 borrel: then implemnet the request you see after you click "Exchange authorization code for tokens"
 borrel:&#160;?
 borrel: no?
 MadKnight: it got like a lot of buttons
 MadKnight: can we just go on discord&#160;?
 borrel: sure 
 MadKnight: oke

 GreenPineapple: ooo this game had chat
 GreenPineapple:&#160;?
 Codify: Got a question about the temperatures kata if anyone's around&#160;:). I've got it done except for catching the null element. I can cheese it by doing a try catch for the exception the test throws but I'm not satisfied with that. 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: null element?  you mean when you have 0 temperatures to analyze?
 Codify: Correct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if n==0 just print 0... else... do them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
 Codify: ah yes! that makes sense. Thanks!
 MadKnight: yea that's the hardest part of the temperatures Automaton2000, don't even question it
 Automaton2000: are there any other way
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 enveloping torpedo
 Automaton2000: do you have the same problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 nah, i don't wrap my torpedo
 Automaton2000: yeah i was not able to find a better one
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i kinda missed some stuff
 Automaton2000: i made a bug in the sdk
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MadKnight yes I'm stuck in bitland at the moment
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 tell me about everything i missed
 Automaton2000: or there is a way to search for the files that are not controlled by the implementation. typical implementations search ...
 MadKnight: PatrickMcGinnisII stop trolling i know u saw my PM
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is PatrickMcGinnisII a troll&#160;?
 Automaton2000: what are you trying to do?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 exactly!
 Automaton2000: but its not really a good idea to do that in a while
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 tell MadKnight that CSB misses him
 Automaton2000: that way you get a good ranking
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000 that's absolutely not a good idea
 Automaton2000: lol you have a game where you had to code it
 MadKnight: okay Automaton2000 PatrickMcGinnisII is actually a troll, i was joking about that but i guess it's exactly like that
 Automaton2000: i don't know what the heck is that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ((($tgs[$x+1]&gt;&gt;($pos+2))&amp;3)
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i just can't win, my 6yo path of being obsessed with CSB just keeps haunting me
 Automaton2000: that is what i mean
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i think i'm gonna take a break and then come back as a brand new character
 Automaton2000: but i don't use it at all :p
 MadKnight: just because of PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my bad
 MadKnight: i can't escape the meme of me, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: did you try to get the same as a normal user
 MadKnight: PatrickMcGinnisII cmon at least just respond in PM
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 only losers run from their path, we gotta find a way to resolve it without blocking our past mistakes
 Automaton2000: only when i had it
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 but for that i have to start talking to people....
 Automaton2000: struct do you have some kind of error
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl struct
 MadKnight: okay Automaton2000 forget it, let's just create a new account and never be ourselves ever again
 <b>**Automaton2000 slaps around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/29443769474274" /> MadKnight: Automaton2000 good thing noone ever heard my voice 
 Automaton2000: thats the problem with that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 MadKnight has Borg technology
 Automaton2000: for example in the statement
 MadKnight: no i have sound mixer
 MadKnight: i can mix multiple audio outputs into multiple audio virtual one of which would go as the actual system audio
 MadKnight: virtual inputs*
 MadKnight: anyway
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sounds like a good puzzle
 MadKnight: naaa
 PatrickMcGinnisII: audio depth mapping
 MadKnight: it just creates virtual audio outputs
 MadKnight: so that an app could mix them in different ways
 MadKnight: for different actual audio outputs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh the dev ID questions
 MadKnight: for example i could direct a game sound into my mic so that u would hear it if i called u
 MadKnight: and stuff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh I thought you were doing mobile api w/ a dummy server
 MadKnight: nono
 MadKnight: it's an existing thing for windows
 MadKnight: it creates virtual audio outputs / inputs
 MadKnight: to separate them
 MadKnight: or to mix them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, not my expertise.  merging is easy...splitting i have no idea
 MadKnight: it just directs sounds to different things
 MadKnight: look i could send u a screenshot and then explain
 MadKnight: but u are ignoring me in DMs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh, i don't really PM
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or discord

 MadKnight: and i dunno how to put it into an AI
 PatrickMcGinnisII: NN is probably not so bad for c4

 FahrendraKhoirul: help me to solve "temperatures problem"
 Uljahn: FahrendraKhoirul: basic algorithm is to convert temperatures from string to ints, make variables for minimum positive and maximum negative value, iterate through temperatures, compare each temperature with those two variables and update them, make some final check and output closest to zero
 AbouAmine: Hi here&#160;!
 GoogleJeff: Hello there
 MadKnight: hihi
 MadKnight: say hello Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it may be the first time i see that i spawned the slasher on the long run
 jacek: what about wanderers, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: so you can try to make it a community puzzle?
 Nerchio: how to win ktulu Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: seems like i have to know what is wrong with it
 Nerchio: silver boss in ktulu is so fed with points :p

 kasudy: how to beat bronze in kutulu?
 jacek: be higher than boss in bronze [solved]
 Nerchio: gz
 that_akward_coder: hello
 uvBoss: @jacek does it work for silvers too?
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: and even for legend bot
 jacek: ss
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: ba-dum-tss
 Automaton2000: and he is in the while loop
 jacek: will he ever break free, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: and do not know where to begin
 uvBoss: what happens if a slasher sees 2 players in line of sight as he is spawning
 uvBoss:&#160;??
 Bassel: Hello
 DrewTriggered: hello
 Aravind3009: hello
 TheSilent_Boy: hi
 TheSilent_Boy: Arvind
 TheSilent_Boy: Are You from India?
 vtenneke: So im trying to complete horse-racing duals and my code works codingame just says that it's too slow... even though im using c++
 vtenneke: and i have 2 loops 
 vtenneke: thats all
 blasterpoard: you need time complexity of n *log n, not n^2
 Uljahn: 2 loops is very inefficient solution, try to use more clever approach with one loop
 uvBoss: agreeed
 Uljahn: there is a hint button on the left i guess

 Uljahn: thanks
 Sachin_07: well this is hard avib
 Gwitninm: They told me to say "hi", so hello everybody... I hope everyone had a good day sofar&#160;:)
 Bassel: Hello Gwitninm
 Uljahn: Gwitninm: welcome aboard
 Tee-Resa: hello :D
 jacek: who told you that?
 Gwitninm: the tutorial message after i completed the first puzzle
 AbouAmine: Hi Gwitninm&#160;!
 Gwitninm: so how does this work? If i have a question i just ask it here or what for is this chat used for?
 Tee-Resa: sure, you can ask here. but ther is a discussion section for each puzzle ... so this chat is for smalltalk i guess
 Astrobytes: Both&#160;:)
 uvBoss: @Astrobytes what happens if a slasher sees 2 players in line of sight as he is spawning??
 uvBoss: do u know?
 DaIsNum: closer to slasher i guess
 Astrobytes: uvBoss: nothing if he's just spawning, if it's in the rushing state it will scare all explorers in the line of sight
 uvBoss: scare all?
 Astrobytes: Yes, they will lose sanity
 uvBoss: when it rushed everyone on LOS are scared?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 uvBoss: oh damn
 uvBoss: what will happen to its xand y tho?
 Astrobytes: But it targets the closest one in line of sight I think (double check in the referee)
 uvBoss: kk
 uvBoss: ty
 Hjax: i feel like when i get 4th i die like, long before anyone else
 BitThief: Is anyone also getting captchas each game?
 jacek: youre clash addict arent you
 Hjax: ugh, when 3 explorers go one way and i go to the other 
 Hjax: its actually the worst
 Nerchio: and wanderers still follw you :D
 Hjax: yep!
 Nerchio: im coming to gold to beat you :D
 Hjax: not if i get legend first! 
 Hjax: (no idea how to get legend right now lol)
 Nerchio: im in gold in 1 min
 Nerchio: you need to hurry
 Hjax: nice :D
 Hjax: when i promoted to gold it was super close 
 Hjax: i think i was 0.02 above the boss
 Nerchio: i crushed him :D
 Hjax: nice!
 Nerchio: but in gold looks like im getting bopped
 VALI: yo les tepu
 K2ARISM: please speak english here
 Astrobytes: And don't be rude either
 Nerchio: what do you guys think what is more random pacman or ktulu
 Hjax: pacman
 Astrobytes: pacman
 TheSilent_Boy: Hi
 Hjax: hi
 Puju: hello
 eulerscheZahl: the most random game is platinum rift 1 anyways
 Marchete: :point_up:
 eulerscheZahl: but locam was a pain too
 Marchete: 1-turn GG multi
 eulerscheZahl: as 1vs1 it's not even that bad
 eulerscheZahl: but with 3+ players :rage:
 Illedan: Damn, Marchete pulling me down
 Illedan: hmpf
 eulerscheZahl: and me up
 eulerscheZahl: oh, smits uncrashed his bot
 Marchete: you started it
 Marchete: I was happy at my place
 eulerscheZahl: and now we should all stop
 Marchete:&#160;:)
 Illedan: It wont
 Illedan: with the contes :P
 Marchete: trigger happy Ille
 eulerscheZahl: "contest"
 Illedan: *contest
 Illedan: dammit
 eulerscheZahl: will your colleague join us in the reply challenge btw?
 eulerscheZahl: depending on the answer we still have 1-2 players to recruit
 Illedan: He said he will come back to me closer to the contest to check his time.
 Marchete: eulerscheZahl is first \o/
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you pushed me up
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i'm afk for a few hours
 Marchete: ok
 Marchete: go Ille go :D
 Illedan: Wow
 Illedan: That broke it
 Illedan: lol
 Marchete: that never happens /s
 Illedan: Let me just reset that
 Illedan: xD
 Hjax: im running out of ideas for heuristics 
 Hjax: and i cant quite crack the boss
 Illedan: OH
 Illedan: I have a bug in my slasher logic
 Illedan: hmmm
 Marchete: you found the bug really fast...
 Illedan: I just looked at my 2 year old code
 Illedan: and was a little puzzled
 Illedan: had to read that diagram again
 Marchete: but why?
 Illedan: The submitted bot is better vs the top
 Marchete: leave the dead code dead...
 Illedan: Hmm, submit froze
 Illedan: Seems so
 Illedan: And it works
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Your go ille go worked
 Illedan: Aaaaand it died. 80 rounds before anyone else
 Illedan: pff
 Hjax: story of my life
 Illedan: You legend yet?
 Hjax: rank 6 gold&#160;:(
 Illedan: :rocket:
 Hjax: im being lazy and trying to not write a search 
 Hjax: but im basically out of ideas for heuristics 
 Hjax: i think i do really poorly when theres a lot of minions near me
 Hjax: like if all 4 explorers are in a corner, surrounded, i usually am the first to die
 AntiVenom616: How to use shield for coders strike back
 Hjax: Illedan if you have any tips id appreciate it :D 
 Hjax: although i know you are doing a search
 uvBoss: @hjax can i ask what ur  heuristics are or is it asking too much?
 Hjax: go read R4N4R4M4's postmortem
 Hjax: mine are very similar 
 uvBoss: oh noice
 uvBoss: ty
 uvBoss: i did skim through the PM
 uvBoss: but everyone was like iused search algo
 uvBoss: so i gave up
 Hjax: R4N4R4M4 is legend with just heuristics 
 uvBoss: damn
 Hjax: i should be able to do the same 
 uvBoss: ayt ty dude
 Illedan: My PM is still 100&#160;% what I am doing :P
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://kvanli.com/stories/kutulu">https://kvanli.com/stories/kutulu</a>
 uvBoss: @hjax GL
 Hjax: i should probably come up with some way to counter yells 
 Hjax: that might be the boosts i need
 uvBoss: @HJax what are voronois used for here?
 Illedan: Maximize possible paths without wanderers
 uvBoss: oh ty
 uvBoss: im noob 
 uvBoss: never heard of these terms before
 Ma.Ay: what is better js or php?
 Hjax: depends what you are doing
 CopperFr: but js can be used for frontend and backend (with node)
 Hjax: but if you are doing server side scripting, maybe you want to use php
 Lisker_the_slow: node is shit man
 ErebosTheos: PHP is mainly for dealing with data while js is mainly used for dealing with elements. but both can be used for both
 Hjax: this gold boss is beating me up 
 Lisker_the_slow: python beats php and javscript asses all day everyday
 Lisker_the_slow: exept in frontend
 Lisker_the_slow: javascript beats python ass
 Hjax: i believe node is generally faster than python 
 Zenoscave: Lisker_the_slow any language is just a tool. some tools are better at some tasks than others
 Hjax: ^
 Zenoscave: saying one language is _ALWAYS_ better than another is juvenile
 AntiSquid: test test, is chat dead?
 Marchete: fast and these languages can't be in the same sentence &lt;/c++ masterrace&gt;
 Hjax: hi squid
 Zenoscave: lol Marchete
 Zenoscave: what about fast development and fast maintenence?
 Zenoscave: hey anti
 Marchete: I don't know, non typed languages aren't good to maintain in my opinion
 Marchete: i mean not strongly typed
 Zenoscave: I agree that without some typing contracts there is overhead of development held on the develop rather than the language
 Marchete: anyways it was just a joke
 Zenoscave: no jokes allowed!
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Marchete:&#160;:(
 itzblinkzy: @Jack92 do you mind sharing your code? i messed up :pensive:
 itzblinkzy: Okay then :cry:
 Zenoscave: itzblinkzy you're in general chat
 itzblinkzy: i know that
 Zenoscave: There may be a Clash specific chat, no?
 Zenoscave: or did it already end
 itzblinkzy: he finished it
 Zenoscave: ah shame.
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan"Coded in C#, ended 5th and was bearly beaten by MSmiths."i like that typo: bearly :D
 eulerscheZahl: :bear:
 eulerscheZahl: "size beeing search depth" :bee:
 Hjax: the gold boss has quite the lead over rank 1 gold 
 eulerscheZahl: nice animal collection
 Hjax: almost two whole points
 eulerscheZahl: because everyone close to the boss got a lucky push
 eulerscheZahl: gold boss is me with reduced search depth btw
 Hjax: i go about 50% with it 
 Hjax: but thats not enough
 Zenoscave: Good to know. Hi euler
 Hjax: im really hurting for ideas as to what my bot is missing on the heuristic front 
 Hjax: im so close, having to add search to get legend would be frustrating 
 Zenoscave: Hjax That usually is the sad part
 Hjax: my only idea left is avoiding yells 
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds complicated
 Hjax: it does 
 Zenoscave: I'm not sure that would work
 eulerscheZahl: not even my sim accounts for that
 Zenoscave: Try it and get top legend
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: not gonna touch this game again
 Marchete: ktulu?
 Marchete: PR1?
 eulerscheZahl: both
 eulerscheZahl: we can extend this list
 Marchete: that's the best answer you can give :D
 Hjax: i still feel like my biggest issue is that i make the wrong decision at a crossroads and end up alone
 Nerchio: too bad :D
 Hjax: do you have a solution to that nerchio? XD
 Nerchio: feel good dying alone&#160;:)
 Hjax:&#160;:)
 Nerchio: i implemented friend finder at the start
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/487216543">https://www.codingame.com/replay/487216543</a>
 Nerchio: blue doesnt like me so i go to brown who likes me
 Nerchio: or yellow or orange whatever this it lol
 eulerscheZahl: fun fact: the boss prints RIGHT, LEFT, ... instead of coordinates
 Nerchio: xD
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/487220030">https://www.codingame.com/replay/487220030</a>
 Hjax: games like this hurt me 
 Nerchio: you can code some late game shelter stuff
 Nerchio: turn 62 you are winning
 Nerchio: no enemies around you for a long time and u have plenty of shelters&#160;:) just take the hit
 Lisker_the_slow: python is faster than vb.net guys
 Hjax: problem is that map has high drain when you are alone
 Lisker_the_slow: compiling wise
 Hjax: you dont even gain sanity by standing on a shelter
 Hjax: you just stay the same
 Nerchio: maybe but it would be worth it this time 
 Lisker_the_slow: modify the code bro
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487220828">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/487220828</a>
 Hjax: even with a massive bonus to shelter score
 Hjax: doesnt make a huge difference
 Nerchio: just thought the corner shelter is a missed opportunity
 Nerchio: taking wanderer hit and staying there then moving to center
 Nerchio: more monsters would go to the other guys
 Nerchio: but yea
 Hjax: i dont actually track wanderer aggro
 Nerchio: its very specific to the situation might not be very useful in the general sense
 Nerchio: I only go to shelters when they are nearby and have energy
 Hjax: maybe it would help if i knew not to move up, because suddenly every wanderer wants to kill me 
 Hjax: notice they all turn orange 
 Nerchio: y
 Nerchio: i didnt even realise they change colors based on the target hahaha :D
 Hjax: the red hat and the orange hat look too similar though
 Nerchio: my least favourite map
 Nerchio: is typhoon

 jacek: o:
 Hjax: got to love the 50 rank variance on submits 
 Hjax: i wonder how convincingly blasterpoard would promote if you dropped him in gold 
 Hjax: theres no way he wins all of his games 
 Lisker_the_slow: yoooo wassup programmersss
 blasterpoard: Hjax a lot of it really is random, but there are some things you can do
 Hjax: like your slasher tricks?
 blasterpoard: I would promote without problems (the depth1 bot promoted on the first try), but I wouldn't completely destroy the league
 blasterpoard: the slasher tricks are just the simulation and eval
 blasterpoard: emergent behavior
 Yunus_3000: hey
 Hjax: i wonder what is in your depth 1 that isnt in mine
 Hjax: could be as simple as me needing better constants on my heuristic terms 
 Yunus_3000: has anyone ever seen the stackoverflow mainpage? xDD
 jacek: hm?
 Hjax: is there a preexisting param tuner somewhere 
 jacek: clop?
 jacek: (not pony thing!)
 Hjax: i mean an implementation 
 blasterpoard: Hjax <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/487237046">https://www.codingame.com/replay/487237046</a> does this help with the question about difference between the bots?
 blasterpoard: it might by my slasher line of sight calculations
 Hjax: i have those, but i dont really take into account slasher state much 
 blasterpoard: well, my slasher heuristics are really good
 Hjax: because if i say "its ok when the slasher is stunned" then depth 1 cant find its way away from the slasher if its in a hallway
 Hjax: it will happily get itself into a no escape situation 
 Hjax: i saw (i think in your post mortem) the mention of precalculating the number of moves to escape los
 blasterpoard: yes
 blasterpoard: that's a part of it
 Hjax: so i guess that adds some artificial depth to the depth 1 search
 Hjax: because it will know if its trapping itself 
 Hjax: ok well, im convinced i need to work on my slasher heuristics at least
 PedroMartine: Xd

 Astrobytes: Problem is most likely elsewhere&#160;;)
 AbouAmine:&#160;:)
 hem123: well, I created a new variable stored it and debuged it and after some operation it is also changed yet I just created the variable to test
 Hjax: legend tonight or i delete account /s
 Astrobytes: take a few minutes break then re-read your code hem123
 Astrobytes: lol Hjax
 Astrobytes: Where you at currently?
 Hjax: rank 4 gold 
 Astrobytes: oof, so close
 Hjax: the boss is pretty beefy
 Hjax: 2 points above rank 1 
 Astrobytes: I think it's eulers bot but nerfed
 Astrobytes: iirc 
 Hjax: yeah he said it was a reduced depth version of his bot
 Astrobytes: I made a start today, I opened VS and copied in the default code.
 Hjax: decided your old bot is beyond redemption? 
 JBM: that's a start
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Sohsoh: problems are so easy, who makes them&#160;??
 Astrobytes: yeah Hjax, I managed to do something with it a while ago but it's... a mess
 jacek: what problems?
 JBM: i got many problems, but easiness ain't one
 Astrobytes: J-ZBM
 Hjax: trying to make your old code work is always a pain 
 Hjax: you are like.... what was i thinking
 Astrobytes: ohhhhh yeah
 MelodraMarco: Hi, I'm new here, I'm doing a test, can anyone tell me where the testcases are displayed?
 Hjax: arent they just in the bottom middle of the ide?
 MelodraMarco: Yeah, but let's say: i have a text that says choose the right temperature and choose the right temperature 2, complex test case, etc. do they have  a description for themselves or they should be self-explainatory?
 Hjax: if you hit the little button in the top right of the testcases window 
 Hjax: you can see the inputs and expected outputs if that helps 
 MelodraMarco: Aaah, got it. Damn, how didn't I see that. Ty&#160;:)

 hem123: challenge 7
 hem123: or could it be that i somehow reach a limit?
 hem123: seems to only occur when chess board is full. Yet I only have 3 lists w 64 constituents
 jacek: do w and belegering rows point to the same object?
 hem123: no they should not. The objects are similar
 hem123: list of 8 lists with length 8 (chessboard).
 hem123: have 1's and 0's for white and for black to determine if either of those win
 hem123: but when the field gets crowded, all of a sudden both lists become the same it seems
 hem123: (with crowded i mean a lot of chess pieces)
 itzblinkzy: Kaikyu do you mind sharing please?
 itzblinkzy: I'm here to learn.
 itzblinkzy: :pensive:
 jacek:     w[i]=wt
 jacek: if you change w[0][0], the belegering[0][0] will change as well
 hem123: that should not be right
 hem123: if i make a new list similar to wt it works
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Kaikyu: @itzblinkzy of course, i will from now on
 itzblinkzy: Thank you. :relaxed:
 hem123: thanks jacek. But this is not normal behaviour right?
 hem123: this should not happen correcT?
 jacek: assigning row to 2d array can be messy in python

 JBM: taken a lok at the cover pic?
 Zenoscave: I figured and Yeah I saw it nice hidden easter egg
 JBM: a "connoisseur" thingy
 JBM: can't get used to that spelling
 JBM: how d'you people even utter that?
 Zenoscave: Will you expand to evaluation of church numerals later?
 Zenoscave: I say con-ih-sewer
 JBM: there's absolutely nothing preventing that just now
 JBM: stress on last?
 JBM: well
 Zenoscave: yes
 JBM: on "SEWer"
 Zenoscave: yup
 JBM: well that's french-suonding enough
 Zenoscave: I mean mapping of the the enumerations to more common digital schemes
 JBM: please expansd
 Zenoscave: input =&gt; /f/x.x&#160;: output =&gt; 0input =&gt; /f/x.f: output =&gt; 1
 Zenoscave: application of lambdas I guess is my point
 Zenoscave: or is that eval? I always get them mixed up
 JBM: it's the converse
 JBM: haven't you seen the SICP cover? ;p
 Zenoscave: once or twice&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: I prefer the little schemer
 JBM: damn
 JBM: that one's been on my list for like 20 years
 JBM: how have i not come to it yet
 Zenoscave: I've skimmed it not done a deep dive yet.
 Zenoscave: I only had a library copy for a while
 Zenoscave: my  campus library was a gold mine for a bit
 JBM: i think i've got an oreilly open invite from work
 JBM: i should really at least pop the cover
 Zenoscave: I agree!
 JBM: the little schemer and lisp in small pieces
 JBM: got on the list at the same time
 Zenoscave: There's a newer 4th book in the schemer series. the Little Typer
 Zenoscave: enough to make you giddy
 JBM: don't think i heard off it

 mzbear: also, signed integer overflow is undefined in c and c++, so you shouldn't rely on code working when a signed variable flips its sign

 esfes: hi where can i learn c++ on this site?
 esfes: or c
 esfes: i am interested in those languages 
 Kazuan: in every task on site, in left top corner of console is a combo box for choose a language try this
 esfes: i can
 Kazuan: you chan choose c or c++ 
 esfes: but than i would fail like almost all challenges lol
 Uljahn: if you mean to learn by practice then sure
 Kazuan: oh do some beginner tutorials on youtube
 Uljahn: ^
 Kazuan: and come back 
 esfes: thanks
 esfes: i would try it
 Kazuan:&#160;;) 
 Kazuan: and if you really beginner try maybe some easiest languages, like c#, java or python 
 esfes: I am intermediate at python
 esfes: know a little java
 esfes: and a little more c#
 Kazuan: oh if you know some other languages then you should know what to do :P
 esfes: I thought there is some kind of a fast learning on this site lol
 Kazuan: actually there is a section "LEARN" in activities
 Kazuan: i thought you have zero experience with programing, and you want to start on c/c++ :P 
 esfes: oh lol
 ERRORR: *-*
 ERRORR: -3-
 esfes: is it possible to install packages for the python 3 challenges?
 Uljahn: no, but you can ask on the forum to add them in the nearest language update
 esfes: i need it for a challenge lol
 Uljahn: there are numpy, scipy and pandas already
 depthzer0: what packages do you want?
 esfes: i just need it for the weekly challenge
 esfes: the package name is shapely
 Uljahn: i'd like to have numba, but expectations for it to be added are low&#160;:(
 esfes: i heard numba can be used to speed up code
 Uljahn: i tried it on my local PC, it's pretty easy to use and the boost is significant
 esfes: can i ask what are your specs?
 Uljahn: but it requires some compile overhead
 Uljahn: specs?
 esfes: what is your cpu, gpu, ram etc
 Uljahn: nothing fancy, im not a dev or a pro coder
 jacek: good morning
 Mr.intro: good moring
 marxal: good morning
 TheAbyssWatcher: good morning
 jacek: c-c-c-combo breaker
 MetehanBayraktar: Ladro why didn't you share your code
 MetehanBayraktar: do you know how can ı send private message to anyone /msg doesnt work
 Rocky[KGF]: What was going
 Uljahn: code sharing is optional, also there are official bots which never share
 Rocky[KGF]: i think code sharing is good because we get the equation or problem to how was it solution i think code sharing is not bad
 jacek: its up to the code sharer
 Rocky[KGF]: yeah jacek
 MetehanBayraktar: I think it musn't be optional because this platform is learning platform I'm here to learn but sometimes no one is sharing their code unless ı say it so
 Mr.intro:&#160;:|
 Uljahn: MetehanBayraktar: learning doesn't mean spoonfeeding i guess
 MSmits: MetehanBayraktar this is not strictly a learning platform
 MSmits: that's just one of the things it does
 MSmits: it's also a competitive platform
 MSmits: we also have botgames, optimization arena's and contests. It is not even allowed to share your code there as it would ruin the competition. 
 MSmits: it wouldnt make sense in that light, to make it mandatory for clashes
 MSmits: besides, plenty of people share their code in clashes. You dont have to see every solution to learn
 MetehanBayraktar: Msmits you greatly explained your idea , and make me convinced but ı have to find a solution not to write everytime ""guys can you please share your codes&#160;?"" sometimes 1 person from 8 people just share their code  
 Uljahn: if you learn from shared code then sharing is similar to tutoring/mentoring, so can we demand people to do it since it's free? just ask nicely and someone will help you
 ZarthaxX: like Uljahn
 MetehanBayraktar: thanks for your messages
 Kiyaba_akihiko: ....

 salmon: Just ping people. I often forget to share it.
 TragicInit: hi
 MSmits: you can autoshare cant you?
 RoboStac: no, autoshare is only for puzzles
 jacek: huh? you can not share puzzle solutions?
 MSmits: ah, that may be a bad call on CG's part
 MSmits: you could have autoshare off as a default 
 MSmits: but when you turn it on, you always share. Nothing wrong with that if it worked that way
 YurkovAS: Can anyone help me find D&amp;B referee? 
 MSmits: mmh it's probably on the forum. I never looked at it

 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 MSmits: a classroom has just arrived
 YurkovAS: eulerscheZahl thanks!
 cooldude420: I apologize for my actions.
 reCurse: Next time it's a ban
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, :sweat_drops:
 cooldude420: I do not think my kick was justified, but alright.
 cooldude420: I hope you all have a nice day.
 reCurse: Very low patience for school kids messing up the chat every day
 jacek: schools these days
 reCurse: Thankless job
 MSmits: you havent had to kick any of mine yet though&#160;:)
 MSmits: I have 6 of them doing CG projects
 Astrobytes: 6 now? Impressive.
 reCurse: Maybe they behave better in Netherlands, I don't know
 jacek: whats the project? trolling CG chat?
 MSmits: yeah 3 are doing game of drones, 1 uttt and 1 csb. the other one is still doing puzzles and enjoying that
 eulerscheZahl: or just a bit older
 MSmits: older mostly
 reCurse: Little is known about their age
 reCurse: Could be 17 acting like 12
 reCurse: Who knows
 MSmits: mine are 17-18
 MSmits: these are my best coders i think though
 ZarthaxX: smito gang
 MSmits: the other ones opted for doing websites and such
 MSmits: also cool, subject is AI
 reCurse: Doing websites? What year is this again? :P
 MSmits: do I use the wrong phrasology, or are you dissing website assignments
 reCurse: Sounds very web 1.0
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ZarthaxX wants to be jumped in to the Smits G squad. :P
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: html/css is part of the curriculum, so it's ok if they want to use that as their last project
 Astrobytes: tickers, midi files playing, ridiculous tiled background images, Comic Sans, that kinda thing? :P
 reCurse: As long as you don't call that coding
 MSmits: i dont
 reCurse: Yes exactly Astrobytes, fellow connoisseur
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 MSmits: I have to teach html/css in a few months to a younger class
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, who deleted my myspace page?&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: boring&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i hate frontend design
 Astrobytes: oh hey Zartho
 MSmits: it's not my favorite subject, but it's ok
 ZarthaxX: same toad
 reCurse: I'm just wondering if there's a point to it now
 ZarthaxX: hi astrobytolus
 Astrobytes: nice!
 MSmits: reCurse what is this skill replaced by. Just wondering
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Depends on the intended use
 reCurse: It's just a tool right
 therealbeef: are these havo or vwo students?
 MSmits: hmtl/css is havo in this case, though they also learn on vwo
 MSmits: the end year project i was talking about earlier is vwo
 reCurse: :flag_nl:
 ZarthaxX: what are those letters :rofl:
 MSmits: havo and vwo are the highest level high school types
 MSmits: vwo being the highest
 MSmits: vwo means preparation for scientific education
 reCurse: Oh I see
 therealbeef: vwo aligns you for university, havo for 'applied science'
 MSmits: havo means higher general education loosely translated
 reCurse: I can draw parallels now
 MSmits: therealbeef is correct
 therealbeef: it makes sense for havo to do html; in their follow up schools they will likely do practical computer science like frontend stuff
 MSmits: also havo is 5 years, ending at 17, vwo is 6 years ending at 18
 MSmits: therealbeef a lot will also code in higher education though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, how many of you use wordpress?
 MSmits: computer science at the university is actually less about coding than computer science at hbo
 reCurse: Well to the original question, depends on the intended use
 MSmits: in this case it's to teach them to think about how stuff should look and user interaction i guess. 
 reCurse: Back then it made sense because most websites were homemade
 reCurse: Nowadays though...
 reCurse: Hmm
 MSmits: for internet security purposes it can also be useful to know some html at least. So you can check the source of a website and know what you're looking at
 MSmits: just like it's useful to know some sql
 therealbeef: i like hbo graduates; they dont ponder too much and just start coding stuff that works 
 MSmits: they're good at that
 jacek: im good at coding without pondering
 MSmits: you're also good at talking without pondering :P
 MSmits: :fire:

 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 FurkanKrblt: heyyy
 FurkanKrblt: what's going on
 MSmits: you'll have to be more specific
 MSmits: but hey
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to make me feel awkward in real life, asking such a question is a valid option
 MSmits: when someone asks you that, you can just say "life"
 jacek: 'whats up' and you say 'sky'
 MSmits: you can also say "stuff"
 eulerscheZahl: but they ask things like "hey was geht?"
 jacek: so geh
 Astrobytes: Simple 'hallo' would do
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: hey was geht?
 Automaton2000: but hard to make a bot that is not in the mood
 jacek: AutomatonNN are you in the mood?
 AutomatonNN: design pattern
 jacek: AutomatonNN so geh
 AutomatonNN: sure doesnt have time to improve my bot and it doesn't work
 Kal_Si: p

 kovi: :thumbsup:
 Westicles: I am still the one and only person to rate tryangle catch
 eulerscheZahl: the website i called CodinGame, not RatinGame
 jacek: you mean ClashGame
 jacek: what else you can do here
 Astrobytes: ClashNRate
 Astrobytes: Paywalls and microtransactions soon no doubt.
 eulerscheZahl: as that the new feature we might see yesterday?
 eulerscheZahl: is*
 struct: Isnt cg model supposed to be free?
 Astrobytes: Only going by the fact they ask how much we'd be willing to pay for the feature
 ZarthaxX: CG crypto
 struct: I can understand them making other options like cg for work
 Astrobytes: (haven't tried it out yet other than the demo)
 Astrobytes: As long as it's kept away from this part of CG I'm cool.
 struct: the think I liked the most
 struct: is that the site 10x less laggy
 Hrant_Matevosyan_1935: why I cant approwe or reject any contrbution?
 ZarthaxX: struct is there still an IDE leak?
 eulerscheZahl: how many clashes have you played so far Hrant_Matevosyan_1935?
 ZarthaxX: Hrant_Matevosyan_1935 maybe your lvl
 ZarthaxX: ah #clashes restriction? lol
 Hrant_Matevosyan_1935: more than 200
 eulerscheZahl: also: does it say WIP in the title?

 TBali: "but they ask things like "hey was geht?"I thought it is "wie geht's?" Are both correct?
 eulerscheZahl: "wie geht's" =&gt; how are you"was geht" =&gt; what's up
 Westicles: why does clash say join a 5min coding battle when it is 15min?
 TBali: I see.Fun fact: in Hungarian there is a (bit old-style) word: "vigéc".It means door-to-door salesman.And comes from the German term pronounced...&#160;:-) 
 eulerscheZahl: in the past there were different clash modes, from 5 to 15min
 TBali: Maybe that was the salesman conversation starter in the  late 19th century
 eulerscheZahl: then they moved the 15min clashes to the puzzle section and only kept the easy ones
 eulerscheZahl: so they are supposed to be easy enough for 5min but you get 15
 Westicles: Aha, okay thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and my prof once told a story of a colleague of him writing a book
 eulerscheZahl: about popular problems like the traveling salesman problem
 eulerscheZahl: publisher didn't like it, renamed to traveling salesperson
 reCurse: I bet someone went to bed all happy of having made the world a better place that day
 TBali: but with the advent of AI, it has to be traveling sales-entity
 Westicles: The world is very soft.  The next big war is going to be crazy
 TBali: And "man-in-the-middle" attacks are supposed to be called "person-in-the-middle attacks". 
 reCurse: Debatable if it's necessary when used in a negative connotation
 eulerscheZahl: i think when in negative context, the male version can stay
 Astrobytes: heh
 TBali: but who knows, if a lady is in the middle, why the shall we bother with countermeasures?&#160;:-)
 BlaiseEbuth: Why&#160;? Can't women be malicious&#160;? :smirk:
 Westicles: The are renaming half the theorems Rawomanujan
 TBali: I did not mean they cannot be a good hacker. I meant some more dirty
 RicoChr: oh. i didn't see that one comming
 Westicles: that's what he or she said
 Astrobytes: *they
 TBali: Anyone solved <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/ways-to-make-change">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/ways-to-make-change</a>
 TBali:&#160;?
 Westicles: yes
 Westicles: should be easy
 TBali: My solution is too slow for the last test.
 eulerscheZahl: i'll try to speedsolve it
 TBali: Has to come up with something
 TBali: maybe memoization&#160;:-)
 RicoChr: Does someone want to debug my code? this is crazy.... Why does my python function freeze way before executing an assingment of a global variable and doesn't freeze if i later dont do that assingment?
 Uljahn: is it some puzzle?
 TBali: I pass it to python gurus here
 Uljahn: or just code unrelated to CG?
 RicoChr: It is the Othello Bot
 RicoChr: so yes, inside CG
 RoboStac: do you think it's freezing because some debug isn't being printed?
 RicoChr: yes
 SadDev: Hi
 RoboStac: does your print statement have flush=True&#160;?
 RicoChr: and i loose due to timeout. 
 RicoChr: no
 BlaiseEbuth: Hi :cry:
 RoboStac: why not? - the instructions clearly tell you to put that for debug
 RicoChr: thanks. i might have missed the instructions.
 BlaiseEbuth: Who read instructions seriously...
 RicoChr: thanks Blaise. :D
 RoboStac: (basically python buffers print statements a lot, so if you don't flush you don't get all your debug if you timeout)
 SadDev: I seem to not really understand how to use the site. Any pointers?
 RicoChr: Yes. I understand it. Thank you very much RoboStac&#160;:) And that non-flushing-buffer also seems to prevent my standard output later in the program. and thats why i loose due to timeout

 JLukeSkywalker: what are the easiest 2 bot multiplayers for beginners?
 JLukeSkywalker: was thinking GoD, but thought the multi-agent might be a bit hard
 DomiKo: Tron is very simple
 jacek: oware?
 JLukeSkywalker: tried oware, got 1st in wood 2, but cant beat the boss at all
 MSmits: ultimate tic tac toe is easiest probably
 MSmits: from the board games that is
 MSmits: otherwise csb maybe
 YurkovAS: JLukeSkywalker for oware you need use minimax (alpha-beta) or mcts
 YurkovAS: and evaluation function like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.joansala.com/auale/strategy/">http://www.joansala.com/auale/strategy/</a>
 daniel_the_tank: I am having issues getting my cart to slow down when approaching the next check point
 daniel_the_tank: I tried a while loop, in java, but I keep getting errors or it doesn't work.
 JLukeSkywalker: daniel, for csb?
 JLukeSkywalker: for csb I would base your thrust off the distance to the next point
 JLukeSkywalker: just as a simple solution
 JLukeSkywalker: thrust = int(next_checkpoint_dist/30)
 JLukeSkywalker: legit just this and some additional angle calculations got me to silver
 daniel_the_tank: yea, thanks
 daniel_the_tank: That is a good idea. 
 daniel_the_tank: I guess I am not sure where to put it. 
 daniel_the_tank: eh, I have been messing with this code for a good while. Best to try something else for a bit
 jacek: :soccer:
 DomiKo: Hypersonic is so broken
 DomiKo: that wall of clones is so huge
 MSmits: if you get past it, the wall wont bother you anymore&#160;:)
 MSmits: you need 2 things to reliably get past it
 MSmits: 1) perfect beamsearch to arbitrary depth
 MSmits: 2) some basic survival
 MSmits: 2nd is to avoid getting trapped easily
 DomiKo: that what people say
 MSmits: my beamsearch is on par with others using only 5-10 ms 
 DomiKo: is on par?
 MSmits: the rest of the time is wasted with a really poor minimax
 MSmits: yeah same score early on with boxes
 MSmits: mostly i lose cuz they kill me or something
 MSmits: it's not hard to do a perfect early game really
 MSmits: performance-wise... still requires a lot of code though
 DomiKo: yeah it's pretty easy
 DomiKo: like making bomb explode in O(4) is really nice
 MSmits: my beamsearch is really crazy, I think I am the only one that did this
 MSmits: a single state is not a single position for your bomber guy
 MSmits: I have a "position map" 
 MSmits: which is all the positions it can be, from the last map change
 MSmits: mapchanges being a bomb placement or item pickup
 MSmits: a bomb exploding clears a part of the position map, meaning all those states are dead
 MSmits: so i get to use 1 state for many position states
 DomiKo: interesing  approach
 MSmits: works fine, saves some hashing i guess
 MSmits: but it makes it a little harder to combine with survival code
 MSmits: I also did a 128 bit bitmap for each thing
 MSmits: bombs/boxes/items/positions
 DomiKo: yeah me too
 MSmits: i have a really weird xy to bit conversion
 DomiKo: I have vertical and horizontal conversion
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff5b6ad2-d097-44b9-8e0d-915358a45e50">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff5b6ad2-d097-44b9-8e0d-915358a45e50</a>
 DomiKo: ohh  wow
 MSmits: ye it's weird :P
 DomiKo: yes it is
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6493e92c-3fed-4723-8be5-33b370347baa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6493e92c-3fed-4723-8be5-33b370347baa</a>
 MSmits: i have bad use of pointers, this was when i just learned C++
 MSmits: 2 years ago
 MSmits: should have just done references
 DomiKo: that was 2 years ago so
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: I dont think i can work on this bot without completely rewriting it
 MSmits: 2700 lines :P
 DomiKo: I'm at 1K&#160;:/ 
 MSmits: i probably have a lot of dumb duplicate code and stuff that could have been done simpler
 DomiKo: Should I predict opponent or just avoid traps?
 DomiKo: I thought that predicting could be better, but know I don't know&#160;:(
 DomiKo: It's like every verrsion of my code hit the wall in 120th place&#160;:/
 MSmits: what you can do is simulate what happens if every player drops a bomb
 DomiKo: what
 MSmits: see if you get trapped
 DomiKo: I had wrong constant in my code The whole time :scream:
 DomiKo: I tried that too
 DomiKo: But then my bot got "scared"
 MSmits: i think euler just lets players drop a bomb everywhere at once
 MSmits: so they drop 5 bombs
 MSmits: seems to work ok
 MSmits: i think I instead do a depth 2 minimax with bombs
 MSmits: oh, no think  i got up to 3 or 4
 MSmits: I just overwrite my beamsearch result if the minimax comes up with kills or forced survival
 MSmits: but it's really crappily coded, almost certainly has bugs
 DomiKo: so you are scared of opponent just trying to kill you?
 DomiKo: OK
 MSmits: yeah it's paranoid
 DomiKo: I passed top100
 DomiKo: I had wrong constant&#160;:(((
 MSmits: it happens
 DomiKo: I'm currently trying to find what will opponent do with beamsearch ofc 
 DomiKo: and then check if he can additionally kill me
 kovi: heuristic in bt is .... weird. yesterday i got some lucky ones, today none
 MSmits: you mean lucky finds for features?
 kovi: yeah
 MSmits: i have no clue how to do BT
 kovi: im really tempted to do nn
 MSmits: the problem is that the frontline for your pawns is a larger construct. Just considering your nearest neighbors is a poor substitute for a NN eval
 kovi: with todays failed attempts
 MSmits: i also think minimax-type algos fair better here
 MSmits: otherwise mine and darkhorse's bots would have done far better
 kovi: i think its a mix
 MSmits: we both used mcts
 MSmits: I can normally always come near trictrac and other minimax users, but here it's useless
 MSmits: in some games, both approaches do well, but in others, one of the two really outperforms
 MSmits: i think checkers, bt, chess are minimax games
 MSmits: i have it on my list to convert bt to minimax
 MSmits: of course it might also be i just failed eval completely...
 kovi: makes sense. clearly there are strong moves and many weak one. but here we need depth as wellmaybe i should reconsider...but now i have a good mcts hammer...so everything is nail...
 DomiKo: chess is about minmax and pruning&#160;:(
 kovi: play tryangle
 DomiKo: I will
 DomiKo: but know uni&#160;:( 
 DomiKo: exams are coming&#160;:(
 MSmits: Studying an hour a day, keeps the low grade away
 DomiKo: For me it's like 8H daily&#160;:/ 
 MSmits: sucks
 DomiKo: I got too many final projects&#160;:( 
 Westicles: I always learned the entire semester the day before the final, then forgot it all the day after
 MSmits: I'm doing a functional programming class starting of friday. This will have a test in about 2 months
 MSmits: looking forward to it.... but then i again i am not a full-time student
 MSmits: I was a really faithful student in high school, always doing homework and all that
 MSmits: then at uni, i skipped every class i could and always crammed at the last moment
 DomiKo: every one?
 DomiKo: that's uni magic
 DomiKo: The key is to pass every class
 MSmits: I remember for my first quantum mechanics test, I studied for 24 hrs straight, skipped a nights sleep, test was at 10 am and I passed it :P
 MSmits: thats after doing nothing at all before that
 Westicles: that is exactly what I did.  never went to class
 MSmits: I always planned on going
 DomiKo: Now I miss going to classes&#160;:(
 MSmits: but morning smits did not agree with day-before-smits
 Westicles: If you study too much, it goes into long term memory.  You don't want to fill your brain with nonsense
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I really feel like I missed out on a lot doing it this way, i am not particularly proud or happy about it
 MSmits: but at that time i was just not mature enough to be a good student
 MSmits: I think when you've been in school for 14 years and then go to uni, you're just fed up with school and try to minimize it
 MSmits: but when you've had a job for 10-15 yrs it can be fun again to go back
 Westicles: Yeah, I've always thought it would be fun to go back and do a math major.  But I'm sure I'd hit real analysis and be sleeping through classes all over again
 MSmits: have to pick something you like
 MSmits: I like coding more than physics
 MSmits: so doing classes like AI, functional programmin and game design are really cool
 DomiKo: My main thought about studies is that you always have not enough time.
 MSmits: depends on what else is in your week ofc
 DomiKo: So when you are older maybe you feel like you have that time.
 MSmits: depends.. I specifically made the choice not to work full time and accept a lower salary
 MSmits: my normal work-time is 75% of max 
 MSmits: so 30 hrs a week
 ArteXa: MSmits, what about money xD?
 MSmits: if you do the kind of work people do who have a university education and you need to work full time to make do, you're doing something wrong
 MSmits: at least in my country
 MSmits: people just want to go on expensive vacations 3 times a year, own 2 cars , have a large house
 MSmits: yeah... then you need to work full time
 MSmits: i dont need that :poop:
 MSmits: time &gt; money and luxury
 ZarthaxX: you mean bots time 
 ZarthaxX: :P
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: or CG time
 Angecide: are there any ways to get rid of modulo operation by using intrinsics or any other c++ hacks?
 MSmits: btw I admit in many jobs you dont have the choice to work part time, i am lucky enough to do have that choice
 ZarthaxX: why intrinsics lol
 Angecide: i heard it was fast
 ZarthaxX: intrisncis do parallel stuff
 ZarthaxX: nothing to do with the operation itself
 Angecide: parallel modulo sounds fast
 MSmits: Angecide if modulo can be sped up some way, you can be sure the compiler figures it out for you
 ZarthaxX: what is the thing do you need to do?
 Angecide: i need to do a&#160;% b
 ZarthaxX: you cant parallelize one a%b
 ZarthaxX: you want to do multiple? im confused
 ZarthaxX: is b a power of 2?
 MSmits: for example, if you do a a%b and a a/b which is a common combination, the compiler will figure out to optimize it
 Angecide: oh, I can just assume it is, I guess it's still random
 ZarthaxX: wdym?
 ZarthaxX: is b is a power of 2, then you can optimize the modulo
 ZarthaxX: a%2^k = a&amp;(2^k - 1)
 Perlorodka: enjoying the clashes, Westicles?
 ZarthaxX: that's if a is positive i think
 MSmits: but if b is a constant and the compiler knows it, it will already have optimized it right?
 ZarthaxX: i didnt think of a being negative
 ZarthaxX: idk, sometimes i didnt see it happen
 Westicles: Perlorodka, yes but I'm on a losing streak
 ZarthaxX: i actually saw a speed improvement even with optim on
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Angecide: ye that should work, I just need to convert a random number down to a range, I can scale the range to be power of 2 if necessary I think
 ZarthaxX: you are talking about using ofast o3
 ZarthaxX: Angecide yup
 ZarthaxX: divisin is the same trick btw, and multiplication 
 ZarthaxX: if a is positive
 ZarthaxX: a*2^k = a&lt;&lt;ka/2^k = a&gt;&gt;k
 Perlorodka: Westicles... always abusing the system
 3ataja: what is he doing? i don't get it
 3ataja: *i don't get why he's doing what he's doing
 YurkovAS: DomiKo i'm stuck in hypersonic at ~120 place with bug: in each cell store only one bomb instead 1-4. May be it help you.
 Westicles: 3ataja, I don't like playing clashes but I like writing contribs.  you need 300 for mod rights
 DomiKo: YurkovAS thank you
 DomiKo: I believe I do it in correct way
 DomiKo: now I have code which could be top20
 DomiKo: and could be top150
 DomiKo: and I don't really know why
 struct: whic hgame DomiKo?
 DomiKo: Hypersonic&#160;:(
 struct: its normal to be within that rank
 DomiKo: 10-150?
 struct: Since that is the place of the copy pasted bots
 struct: yes
 MSmits: 20-100 i think
 DomiKo: 130+ 100%
 DomiKo: I can pick players from rank 120 that are CLONES
 struct: yeah
 DomiKo: It's so frustrating
 DomiKo: When I can't resubmit like normal
 DomiKo: but I have to spam it
 DomiKo: to get first 10 wins
 MSmits: DomiKo dont do that
 MSmits: just setup a cg bench vs 1 clone
 MSmits: and dont submit at all
 DomiKo: if I get 1 vs 1 its OK
 MSmits: if you can get a good winrate vs 1 clone, you can do it vs all
 DomiKo: but in 1 vs 1 vs 1 mode
 MSmits: then add 3 clones
 DomiKo: that's ...
 MSmits: and do different combinations
 YurkovAS: And has "ugly bomb escaping" check in depth 1 for each new state: opponents place bombs in each dirs and start beam search to depth 9.
 sylq: hi people,Do I need to wait for the end of a clash of code after beating it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope.
 sylq: ok thanks! :thumbsup:
 Dwoth: Anyone notice the server being laggy?
 VladimirAngelov: It always gets like that around this time apparently
 Wontonimo: server reboots, cuz it's 1:30 in France
 TheSunnyCastle_ee5e: h
 Wontonimo: i
 LegendaryStone: westicles why you dont complete any clashes?
 HenryZhang: westicles is a bot
 HenryZhang: he joins every battle

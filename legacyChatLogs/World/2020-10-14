 YCS-Venom: REALLY
 YCS-Venom: There is no bots i think
 Allis: @YCS-Venom If you go to the Clash leaderboard and sort by clashes descending, the first 11  users are bots implemented by CodinGame.
 Allis: The idea being that you can always get a Clash going even if nobody's awake.
 Murleys: Anyone else found that they don't really get fastest code all that much? I pretty much get 90% of the time shortest code or reverse, is their a way we can set our preference?
 Uljahn: Murleys: i guess it's possible for private clashes only, not for regular ones
 Murleys:  UIjahn: ah dam that sucks, I hate doing the shortest code challenges in C# ...
 Jenroksis: hi
 hatbuinho: hello world&#160;:))
 OmerDrk: hello
 justacoder: Is there any code versioning in this place? Like, the code that got me to rank X, can I get that back? Say I've changed stuff, in the mean time? Or do I have to manage all that off line?
 DaNinja: CG saves a history of your code every time you hit Submit or Test in Arena
 OmerDrk: I am so idiot I cant do "Reactangle Partition"
 OmerDrk: Rectangle*
 Alshock: it has nothing to do with idiocy
 Alshock: What problem do you have with that puzzle OmerDrk&#160;? Is it too slow? Or do you not see a way to do it?
 Hipip: why tf , they only judge on the number of characters
 MSmits: Hipip I don't know you're doing, but you've obviously only seen a tiny bit of this site
 MSmits: I am guessing you played a clash and the type was code golf
 MSmits: one of 3 possible types (you can't control which you get)
 Hipip: oh okay
 Hipip: gotcha
 MSmits: there's more fun to be had in the bot programming section
 MSmits: but that will take a bit more time
 jacek: so windy so rainy
 Hipip: I think there is a lil bit of unfairness here xD
 Hipip: high level languages always win
 jacek: maybe in clashes
 Einwickler: I would even say that's really only  for clashes and code golf puzzles.
 Hipip: what are some other interesting game modes other than clashes and golf puzzles&#160;?
 Hipip: I'm kinda new here
 MSmits: just told you  on my last message&#160;:)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 MSmits: it's the best thing on CG
 MSmits: imho
 MSmits: many games to choose from
 Hipip: oh okay didn't see it
 Hipip: thanks
 MSmits: hf
 Hipip: it's some ai  shit&#160;?
 MSmits: much ai :poop:
 Hipip: BIG BRAIN
 MSmits: :owl:
 Hipip: holy moly I'm talking to a big brain
 Hipip: he's 23rd Global
 Hipip: dayum
 Hipip: lol
 MSmits: many people active on this chat are high ranked
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl is here every day almost
 MSmits: he is ranked 1
 Hipip: wow cool
 justacoder: @DaNinja, how does one access that? Thanks. 
 MSmits: unless he's not, sometimes he's 2
 Hipip: i'm always here also
 Hipip: 88,751st
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Hipip: :nerd:
 MSmits: you quickly gain rank when doing bot programming
 MSmits: doesnt really matter which game, just pick something you like
 Hipip: but you're so good at python
 MSmits: not really
 Hipip: so don't tell me that high level are not biased here
 MSmits: i am basic at python
 MSmits: probably my best language is C# but only intermediatre there
 Hipip: could they consider the speed of execution or somthn like that
 Hipip: in clashes
 Hipip: but shit different languages
 DaNinja: justacoder check Results &gt; History
 MSmits: that plays into bot programming and optimization
 MSmits: your speed
 Hipip: cool
 MSmits: thats why in many bot programming games, the top is c++ or rust or similar
 MSmits: not all though
 MSmits: some are mostly smart heuristics and require no speed
 Hipip: c++ is used more than py&#160;? in the bot programming stuff
 MSmits: well i should clarify, in many bot games the top is c++ because the top players are used to this language, it doesnt always necessarily mean its best for that game
 Hipip: oh okay 
 MSmits: in bot programming, python is still used a lot
 MSmits: it's just when you get ranked high in some games, performance starts to really matter
 Hipip: yeah because in ml and ai stuff its the most used
 MSmits: not exactly
 MSmits: python is the scripting language used fo rit
 Hipip: well the data says that
 MSmits: at the back, compiled stuff is running that might have been coded in C++ or similar
 MSmits: but most people don't touch that part
 Hipip: c++ is their god right 
 MSmits: we have machine learning here too
 MSmits: the top 4 in oware abapa are all neural networks
 MSmits: also top 5 (I believe) in coder strikes back
 MSmits: but it's not easy to make it work here due to code size limit
 Hipip: interesting
 Hipip: what about the clashes 
 MSmits: thats usually python and ruby
 Hipip: the best ones are the ones who uses py&#160;?
 MSmits: because you code faster in it and it takes less characters
 Hipip: in clashes
 Hipip: hmm okay
 MSmits: i try to use python in clashes, but i am pretty mediocre at it
 Hipip: I always find a 500chars solution with c# or c++ and one with 50chars with py
 Hipip: xD
 MSmits: can be better than 500 prolly
 MSmits: but each language has its tricks
 Hipip: what about some games about data structures&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm
 Hipip: linkes lists , trees and shit 
 Hipip: linked*
 MSmits: can be useful sometimes
 MSmits: trees for sure
 MSmits: always
 MSmits: for boardgames it's almost always minimax, or mcts or related
 MSmits: I focus a lot on boardgames, because it's more fun to me
 MSmits: less code to simulate the game, so it's more about coding a search algorithm
 Hipip: what did you study before you started playing it&#160;?
 MSmits: some games are really complicated and take like 500 lines of code just to simulate
 MSmits: i am a physics teacher studying to be a CS teacher
 MSmits: master of astrophysics, many years ago
 Hipip: oh how cool is that
 Hipip: amazing
 MSmits: thanks
 Hipip: np
 Hipip: it was amazing talking to you , Have  a great Day , Sir :grin:
 MSmits: you too, you can always ask questions here, sometimes you won't get a response, depends on the time of day
 MSmits: hf
 Hipip: yep I'll , see ya
 Einwickler: MSmits talking about minimax and board games: do you have any recommendation for a reference to get started with it?
 MSmits: google is full of all sorts of tutorials for it, it's really easy to find. As for a game to use it on: Try a simple board game. Might be less flashy and fun for you, but it does away with a lot of the unnecessary bits to learn the algo
 MSmits: try ultimate tic tac toe
 MSmits: try to test the algorithm before you get to bronze (dont submit or you will be promoted)
 Einwickler: why is that?
 MSmits: in bronze it goes from  3x3 to 9x9, a bit more complicated to simulate
 Einwickler: ahh okay
 MSmits: it's not really hard, but a bit of a hassle if all you're looking to do is learn minimax
 MSmits: so just try "play my code"
 MSmits: good enough to test it 
 Einwickler: Yeah I guess Ill have to to improve in onitama someday. Got place 71 in wood 1 and its really fun but I fully ignored minimax and just wrote some basic decision making
 MSmits: btw, once you know minimax, really consider switching to negamax. It's cleaner, same functionality for half the code
 MSmits: but conceptually slightly harder
 MSmits: yeah minimax works great in onitama
 Einwickler: So you would definitely recommend going for minmax first though?
 MSmits: yeah
 Einwickler: alrightt
 MSmits: you will just have some duplicate code due to: if player == 0 then
 MSmits: else ...
 MSmits: negamax runs from the perspective of the player whose turn it is, minimax has to do the if on every iteration
 MSmits: once you got negamax and minimax down, quickly move to ab pruning, which makes you search a lot deeper
 Einwickler: But the basic idea of both is to calculate possible moves right? So only the decision made based on that data is different?
 Einwickler: Or do they even make the same choices but negamax code is smaller?
 MSmits: negamax makes the same choices as minimax probably, they are  equally fast
 MSmits: ab pruning may make a different choice because it searches deeper
 MSmits: but if it does make a different choice, it is very likely a better one
 MSmits: negamax is simply more elegantly coded, but a little more obscured
 MSmits: btw, ab pruning is an enhancement to both negamax or minimax, doesnt matter
 Einwickler: alright that should be enought to start with. Thank you for the great help as always&#160;;)
 MSmits: np&#160;:)
 jacek: for starters, just pick up a game, make function that lists all available moves, make function doMove(), undoMove() and end conditions and youre there
 MSmits: yeah you have to do that, that's why you pick a simple game to start with
 Einwickler: Wait dbdr submit his solution for tic-tac-toe in Java? I always thought he does nearly everything in Rust :scream:
 dbdr: I started rust 1.5 years ago
 MSmits: java is a much slower language, so that result is quite good Einwickler	
 MSmits: my first version was in C#
 dbdr: not that much slower, still compiled to native code at runtime
 dbdr: 1.5 to 2 times slower, roughly
 MSmits: my experience with C# is 2-3x slower for similar code
 dbdr: right
 jacek: depending on object allocation
 MSmits: yeah i use object pools, even in C# if i can
 Einwickler: Dont get me wrong I wouldn't dare to say its a bad solution. I was just surprised to see a solution from dbdr on the leaderboard thats not written in rust
 MSmits: ah yeah
 dbdr: you can tell it's an old one, that's all
 MSmits: you can always go back dbdr
 dbdr: I think the submit date does not match it, I had to resubmit because of a Java upgrade
 MSmits: it's probably less than a days work
 dbdr: a day for doing what?
 MSmits: conversion
 dbdr: from Java to Rust?
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: yeah, I will do it eventually&#160;:)
 MSmits: you'll get sidetracked of course. At first you'll want to convert directly, then you will notice all sorts of possibilities java doesnt have and...
 dbdr: well, you can use the new langage feature, but still aim for identical behaviour first
 dbdr: nice for testing
 MSmits: yeah thats true
 MSmits: i took a detour
 dbdr: language features mostly help for performance
 MSmits: was working on endgame database for checkers
 dbdr: behaviour changes is a different beast
 jacek: d&amp;b almost tripled this week
 MSmits: then got more into retrograde analysis and now I have an endgame book for Bandas :P
 dbdr: oh? that's why I got CPs then&#160;:)
 MSmits: nice
 dbdr: despite losing the #1 in it
 dbdr: wow, 140 in d&amp;b :O
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: i should go back soon
 MSmits: but bandas is so fun
 jacek: detronize thay random guy
 MSmits: I thought you worshipped him?
 dbdr: d&amp;b is a headache begging to happen :D
 MSmits: now he is a random guy&#160;:(
 dbdr: the random god religion&#160;:)
 jacek: random guy... it fits the mcts inventor
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: the "random" guy
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: I'm sure they said that about people when mcts was coming up
 Shadowtick: morning everyone
 MSmits: like when quantum mechanics was coming up
 Shadowtick: what did I walk into?
 MSmits: "code does not play dice"
 MSmits: wrong closet
 Shadowtick: @_@ im confused
 MSmits: it happens
 MSmits: try :confused:
 Shadowtick: can someone tell me what is happening
 dbdr: Einwickler: for a fixed depth, minimax, negamax and alphabeta should all return the same result
 jacek: my first attempt at meme <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgflip.com/4igpds.jpg">https://i.imgflip.com/4igpds.jpg</a>
 Einwickler: dbdr but they differ on the max depth they can reach?
 MSmits: right Einwickler, ab pruning will just take less time in that instance
 MSmits: in a set amount of time yes Einwickler
 dbdr: yes, because ab is faster, you can make it go deeper
 Einwickler: Ah yea that makes sense
 MSmits: all those algo's will solve the game when given enough time
 dbdr: often more than the age of the universe though&#160;:)
 MSmits: not if he starts with uttt wood
 dbdr: except near the endgame
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: ttt starts near the endgame&#160;;)
 MSmits: quite a few games on CG are solvable halfway through
 MSmits: true
 dbdr: yeah, like othello
 MSmits: Bandas, Onitama, othello, yavalath
 MSmits: if you make a wrong move, yavalath is solvable at ply 2 :P
 jacek: oware "v
 dbdr: unultimate uttt&#160;;)
 dbdr: that's like a virgin bloodymary
 MSmits: yeah
 GuyShtiler: whats to correct syntax?
 GuyShtiler: print(xmid+"  "+ymid)
 MSmits: print(xmid,ymid) will work
 Shadowtick: ... ok imma go
 MSmits: i think that inserts a space
 dbdr: but using + should also be find
 dbdr: *fine
 jacek: unless xmid ymid are ints
 dbdr: right
 GuyShtiler: they are floatts
 MSmits: what will that even do?
 dbdr: str(xmid)
 MSmits: python is weird with type conversion
 white-undo: import sys
 dbdr: does CG have fstrings?
 MSmits: I did a bitboard in python once. It was a huge pain
 dbdr: python 3.6 I think
 GuyShtiler: INPUT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d12a5932-e79c-4c1e-8524-d6e42991eef1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d12a5932-e79c-4c1e-8524-d6e42991eef1</a>
 MSmits: damn still not fixed?
 MSmits: they need to get on the job
 GuyShtiler: i need tot make a code that takes 2 cords and prints the mid point
 dbdr: MSmits: coding a bitboard in python is like running a marathon in a suit&#160;;)
 GuyShtiler: isnt the formula x1+x2 / 2 , y1+y2 / 2?
 MSmits: so you're stuck in traffic and late for a meeting. It happens
 dbdr: (x1+x2)/2
 Shadowtick: ... I made a special p5.js project for this website
 MSmits: dump the car and start running
 Shadowtick: but Idk if the code will work in here
 GuyShtiler: i need those that are ints
 GuyShtiler: to be printed as ints
 GuyShtiler: and those who are floats print as floats
 GuyShtiler: Found: 2.0 3.5Expected: 2 3.5
 dbdr: int(...)
 MSmits: then they are probably not floats
 MSmits: err ints
 GuyShtiler: Found: 2.0 3.5Expected: 2 3.5
 MSmits: like dbdr says, convert to int first
 MSmits: somewhere in your calculation, python saw fit to make your number a float
 GuyShtiler: yeah because of the / 2
 MSmits: likely
 MSmits: you can do //2
 MSmits: integer division
 jacek: then 3.5 will fail
 GuyShtiler: yeah
 MSmits: if he's sure they are even numbers
 GuyShtiler: 2.0&#160;% 2 == 0 is true?
 MSmits: that could work
 MSmits: or before you divide, do x &amp; 1 == 0 
 dbdr: GuyShtiler: for this kind of question, just try it
 GuyShtiler: i passed one test lol
 GuyShtiler: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb2e40b2-b9f6-40f5-ae28-a0c68fd25c97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb2e40b2-b9f6-40f5-ae28-a0c68fd25c97</a>
 GuyShtiler: damn
 MSmits: pastebin doesnt work
 GuyShtiler: i did if its even convert it to int
 MSmits: it's annoying&#160;:(
 GuyShtiler: but that doesnt work either
 MSmits: hmm conditional typecasting
 MSmits: that seems iffy
 GuyShtiler: FailureFound: 5.0 5.0Expected: 5 5
 jacek: if its ehole number then make it int
 MSmits: a simpler thing you can do is this
 MSmits: convert to string, check if it contains a dot, then cut off the last 2 characters
 jacek: so simple *.*
 MSmits: dot and zero
 GuyShtiler: if its a 1.25...
 MSmits: does that happen too?
 GuyShtiler: too late i missed the question lol
 MSmits: allright then check if it has a dot and if everything right of the dot is a zero
 GuyShtiler: could have made a substring from 1 before the dot
 GuyShtiler: and convert it to int
 GuyShtiler: i suppose the answer is way eaiser then that
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-check-int-float/">https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-check-int-float/</a>
 GuyShtiler: print('{0:g}'.format((x_1+x_2)/2), '{0:g}'.format((y_1+y_2)/2))
 GuyShtiler: that was the answer
 MSmits: f = 1.23
 MSmits: f_i = 100.0
 GuyShtiler: i need to count the same occurances on a string
 GuyShtiler: of names seperated by a space
 Scarfield: MSmits still here?&#160;:)
 guygy: how do i code
 icecream17: well... what do you know about coding
 guygy: how to make a game
 MadKnight: var game = new Game();
 MadKnight: i thought it was trivial
 Metanoob: ah, what kind of game do you want to make? Game with only text, 2d graphics, 3d graphics?
 guygy: 2d to start out
 Metanoob: Ok, are you familiar with any programming language at the moment?
 guygy: no
 The_Auditor: you'll have to learn the basics of programming first
 Metanoob: Although you can learn a language at the same times as learning how to make a game, it is good to at least have some basics in the language of your choice. Do you have an idea of what language you would like to learn?
 The_Auditor: it's like: "who to write a book?" "Do you know how to write sentences?"
 guygy: ok how do i do that
 guygy: i would like to learn java script
 icecream17: here's a javascript guide: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide</a>
 guygy: is it for beginers
 Metanoob: Great! nice one icecream
 The_Auditor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-learn-javascript-programming-language-for-free-with-our-new-course/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-learn-javascript-programming-language-for-free-with-our-new-course/</a>

 guygy: are you guys game makers
 icecream17: lol
 The_Auditor: i'm a game player
 icecream17: i mean, it's possible but not really...
 guygy: what languages do you know
 Metanoob: I did make a few games, however nothing worth playing&#160;:)
 lavakat: can some one link a guide to most c# codes and what they do
 The_Auditor: www.google.com
 Metanoob: The_Auditor ruthless  :stuck_out_tongue:
 Metanoob: but also a very good link
 icecream17: oh i think my last link was pretty bad looking at it
 The_Auditor: if you like learning by watching video for javascript i'd try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhW0NCG7M536uHGOtJ95Ut2">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhW0NCG7M536uHGOtJ95Ut2</a>
 The_Auditor: i programed in pascal/delphi about 20 years ago, neadless to say i forgot most of it. so when i tried to solve a puzzle using pascal all i needed was google
 pluieciel: I think Codecombat is nice for beginners
 The_Auditor: seconded Codecombat
 DerpyTaterTot: hi
 Flat_Erick: Hey guys! I have a warning, saying that my code did not read all available input before printing instruction
 Flat_Erick: Would that mean that my code is too slow?
 Flat_Erick: it works fine for previous test cases
 Flat_Erick: Skynet Revolution - Episode 2
 Flat_Erick: is the puzzle im working on
 Scarfield: could be that either you dont read all the input :p or you print more than one output the same turn?
 Flat_Erick: I mean, it shouldnt be the case, since the previous puzzles worked fine
 Flat_Erick: also one of the puzzles sometimes work, but sometimes it doesnt 
 Flat_Erick: weird stuff going on :D
 Flat_Erick: test cases* not puzzles
 Scarfield: i think the most likely cause is that you for some reason are printing more than once the same turn. doing that will give you the same error as not reading all the input asfaik. probably some weird edge case that isnt clear. As for the sometimes works sometimes not, are you doing some search with a timelimit?
 Flat_Erick: What do you mean 'search with a timelimit'?
 eulerscheZahl: while (timer &lt; 50ms) continueSearch()
 Scarfield: looking through the posible options ( i havent done that puzzle btw) untill no more time left
 Scarfield: if that is the case, the timer limit could be too large, and sometimes timeout
 Flat_Erick: How can I check the timer limit?
 Flat_Erick: Im using python3
 Flat_Erick: Response time per turn ≤ 150ms
 Flat_Erick: I guess my code is too slow? :joy:
 Flat_Erick: I will actually check it
 Flat_Erick: didnt know there is a timelimit
 Flat_Erick: thanks for that&#160;;)
 Flat_Erick: yep, it takes 200ms in the further test cases
 Scarfield: nice, thats one issue cause found&#160;:) 
 jacek: issuefield
 Majeck: Flat_Erick I know I'm a little late but in python you can do:
 Majeck: import time
 Shadowtick: hi
 Majeck: start = time.time()
 Majeck: # Rest of code...
 jacek: :O
 Flat_Erick: Yeah, thanks Majeck, Ive done that already
 Majeck: time_elapsed = time.time() - start
 Majeck: Got there too late hahaha
 Flat_Erick: It seems like my path finding algorithm is slow
 Majeck: What puzzle?
 Flat_Erick: Skynet Revolution - Episode 2
 Flat_Erick: Have you done this one?
 Unkmar: What if I choose to ONLY solve puzzles?
 The_Auditor: all power to you&#160;!
 The_Auditor: i don't like code golf, so i don't do it
 LastRick: That's favorite thing to do here as well. Slowly working my way through all the puzzles
 Astrobytes: feel free, plenty people do. Just do what you enjoy.
 Unkmar: I'm not here for fun. I'm only here to learn and possible viability of getting a job.
 Astrobytes: Alright then. My apologies. 
 Einwickler: Unkmar why not both?
 Astrobytes: You won't learn much here per se, you have to learn elsewhere for the most part and apply it here
 Astrobytes: As for getting a job... well
 MSmits: here you become motivated to learn. But personally, just asking stuff on chat here taught me  alot
 Astrobytes: Yes, chat can be truly incredible sometimes from a learning persepctive
 Astrobytes: *perspective
 Astrobytes: MSmits taught me loads
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You're most welcome
 jacek: yeah, here's no fun, only work.
 Astrobytes: We all clock in at the same time and commit to 8-12 hours of rigorous CGing
 jacek: those are rookie numbers
 Astrobytes: :P
 The_Auditor: @Astrobytes are you kidding?
 Astrobytes: The_Auditor: of course&#160;;)
 The_Auditor: few
 MSmits: some days are like that for me though
 The_Auditor: yeah, some days . . . his message implied every day
 MSmits: well in a perfect world, he would be right
 Astrobytes: lol indeed
 The_Auditor: in a perferct world, i wouldn't have to do anything else and would spend all my time here
 MSmits: that was my point
 Astrobytes: Just highlighting that most CG users regard the site as fun/enjoyment with a healthy dose of learning
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: but some have found their careers here
 Astrobytes: A couple, yes
 Astrobytes: *A few
 MSmits: you could argue I have as well. Even though it's teaching and not coding 
 Astrobytes: Yes, was about to say that actually&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I guess there's a few people who have perhaps switched careers as a result of using CG
 MSmits: I know, I was just trying to preserve your keyboard. I have a spare one
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: i realized maybe i should switch to machine learning job instead of making shitty apps for android
 MSmits: mmh you could also make great apps for android
 LastRick: HAH
 Astrobytes: Could be a good switch
 Astrobytes: Depends on the job
 jacek: though probably i would need to learn properly, with... math
 The_Auditor: do you find that current interface on CG is not conducive to ML
 Astrobytes: all those squiggles jacek
 MSmits: The_Auditor ML in CG is a bug that was turned into a feature by players
 MSmits: definitely not conducive to ML
 jacek: well ML is associated with python
 The_Auditor: like, i can't easily run a genetic ML
 The_Auditor: unless i reimplement the runner myself
 jacek: but there is not ml libraries here and CG has very hard limit on code size and execution
 MSmits: right
 Shadowtick: I broke my minecraft
 Shadowtick:&#160;;-;
 jacek: i had to implement NN for some bots myself and it turned out quite good
 Shadowtick: I cant see the buttons to it anymore
 Shadowtick: no play button or anything
 ICanCode: i just looked at a website called xarg.org, and it gave me some code but i dont know if i should use F#, C++ ect. ect. any ideas?
 The_Auditor: any chance to add an API to CG to make it ML friendly&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Feel free to suggest in the forum The_Auditor
 Astrobytes: Everyone uses the unofficial API to download replay data and such currently
 ICanCode: im new to coding so i dont really know most of the stuff ur saying
 MSmits: argh... I hate this. I have a bugged bot in Bandas that is near nr 1... if I fix it I can barely reach 7
 ICanCode: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Astrobytes: ICanCode: that site has solutions to puzzles on this site. I don't recommend copying and pasting
 The_Auditor: say, the Ice and Fire runner is not containing any secrets, i guess, is it public? or can it be made public?
 jacek: you mean the referee?
 Astrobytes: The referee is available for all multis
 The_Auditor: where&#160;? how?
 Astrobytes: There's a link to a github repo in the statement usually 
 The_Auditor: yaya&#160;! weekend gone&#160;!
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 random12313: bad face85
 random12313: input and output
 random12313: someone knows maybe?
 random12313: A beef64
 ICanCode: im trying to recreate among us, (if you know what the game is) Anyone want to help?
 random12313: BABE46
 random12313: abcdef75
 Astrobytes: hex
 random12313: whats hex
 random12313: Babe face, A beef, A decade, A bee.296
 Shadowtick: can you code in minecraft by anychance?
 Astrobytes: you might wanna skip that one and google hexadecimal
 ICanCode: not me shadow
 ICanCode: can anyone code in among us?
 ICanCode: or atleast a singleplayer
 Shadowtick: Idk how
 Shadowtick: but I do have it so we could play some among us
 ICanCode: me either
 Shadowtick: :3
 ICanCode: lel
 Einwickler: Alphaloc you there?
 Shadowtick: ICanCode I am gonna send you a message
 jacek: :O
 Alphaloc: I am
 ICanCode: can anyone here code really well?
 ICanCode: and know the game among us?
 Astrobytes: Nope. We're all totally incompetent.
 Einwickler: Would you explain your solution on the clash we just played?
 Einwickler: Is it just the dif between highest and lowest index of '#'?
 ICanCode: huh
 The_Auditor: if i knew to code very well, why would i be on a site to learn coding&#160;?
 jacek: whats with the among us? all memes sites are full of it
 Astrobytes: Some new garbage that kids are playing on their mobiles I presume
 <b>**Astrobytes exits old man mode</b></p><p><img src="/a/35448723594340" /> jacek: ok boomer
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 The_Auditor: ROFL
 The_Auditor: ICanCode do you want to make a replica of Among Us or does the Among Us have a way to program the player actions?
 ICanCode: i am wanting a replica
 ICanCode: cant recreate it completely
 ICanCode: unless actual people play
 ICanCode: there would have to be bots
 random12313: those reverses
 random12313: damn

 Einwickler: Are you really just asking for a solution in world chat while being in a clash? :thinking:
 random12313: after i finished
 Astrobytes: random12313: try looking at other people's solutions if they shared the code rather than flooding the chat, or message them
 random12313: Yeah i just figured out i could do that btw no one solved it
 ICanCode: can anyone here code really well?and know the game among us?
 -CoolHandLuke-: hi
 JBM: ho
 -CoolHandLuke-: ho ho ho marry crismas
 -CoolHandLuke-: lol
 Astrobytes: I have no wish to marry crismas, whoever she is
 Astrobytes: ICanCode: stop repeating the same questions
 Astrobytes: hi JBM 
 JBM: heya astroes
 ICanCode: hahaha, sOOOO fUnnY AssTrOBytEs
 JBM: wazza
 JBM: my my don't we have a winner here
 Astrobytes: Same old crap, different day. Yourself?
 JBM: kinda same
 JBM: i've got two contribs in WIP with no motivation to push further, a third one in draft
 JBM: i solved indy3 at long last today and that got me wondering whether i had actually solved indy2
 jacek: indy3?
 JBM: (answer: seems so)
 JBM: yeah looks like it's "last crusade" nowadays
 JBM: until the pm changes his mind
 Astrobytes: Yeah, naming changed over the years for a couple of 'em
 Astrobytes: What's the other contrib other than TvC?
 JBM: cglambda
 Astrobytes: Oh wait , the esolang one
 Astrobytes: Why are you stuck?
 jacek: youre not gonna push further the TvC?
 JBM: i'd need to get a more "easing" test suite up
 JBM: oh i am
 JBM: *someday*
 jacek: 2137st
 JBM: i'll have no remorse whatsoever delaying it until it reaches +250
 Astrobytes: Hey, there's no rush on a WIP
 JBM: then i'll start having slight questionings, but nothing to keep me from sleeping
 Astrobytes: as for TvC, longer the better. I grin everytime I see it
 JBM: then when I find the right timing between the official (or was it) contest and xmas
 JBM: i can have my very own open to everyone EXCEPT ISLINGTON contest
 Astrobytes: lol, such exclusion
 JBM: still have no idea what islington is, but i didn't like it the first time round
 Astrobytes: It's (iirc) a college in Nepal that's affiliated with another in London (Metropolitan?)
 JBM: too bad for them
 Astrobytes: Never let it be said that JBM bears any grudges :P
 JBM: Never
 Astrobytes: Anyways, I'm out early. Need to pet my cat then play some music (rediscovered my guitar) 
 JBM: i oughta look at mine too every now and then
 JBM: oh well
 Astrobytes: That was my issue, kept looking at it and not playing it
 JBM: it's like 1m away
 Astrobytes: It's a struggle motivation-wise but once I'm doing it I'm alright
 JBM: but i'm already listening to music
 JBM: hah talk about motivation
 JBM: was about to get back to playing in the orchestra
 JBM: and if i got correct recollections we're now grounded at night for curfew
 JBM: yay
 Astrobytes: Ah damn, that sucks pretty majorly
 JBM: yup
 Astrobytes: Right. Cat petted. I'm out. Goodnight JBM and take care
 JBM: gn8, seeya
 MSmits: gn
 ICanCode: seeya astro
 ICanCode: srsly tho can anyone here code among us?
 ICanCode: or atleast like recreate it&gt;
 ICanCode:&#160;?
 ICanCode: im really bad
 ICanCode: like i havent took any classes or anything
 MSmits: just try it and get better&#160;:)
 Scarfield: hey MSmits, if you have a monomolecular layer of some material, wouldnt it technically only be 1 surface, but with 2 sides?
 jacek: physics? :scream:
 MSmits: not if they were molecules
 Einwickler: Oh wow now we are getting kind of philiosophical here :D
 MSmits: maybe if they were elementary point particles
 MSmits: molecules still have sides
 Shadowtick: ya yeet imma go now
 Shadowtick: hope you all have a great week
 MSmits: you too
 Shadowtick: I will try but I cant guareenty because I might have more panic attacks from school
 Shadowtick: guareente*
 MSmits: please dont panic trying to spell guarantee
 Scarfield: yea, but if you were to calculate the surface energy, there is only that 1 layer, and i guess you could technically say it only has 1 surface
 MSmits: what surface energy?
 MSmits: do you mean the bindings between the molecules?
 Scarfield: well yea, there wouldnt really be surface tension without other "layers"
 Shadowtick: alright I better go before I do while I try figuring out what is happening
 MSmits: in that sense there is one layer and if that is your defining characteristic of having a surface then sure
 MSmits: surfaces don't have to be flat
 MSmits: they can curve and form a sphere
 MSmits: the molecular bindings will have an angle
 MSmits: then sides matter
 problems: these questions are so difficult. know where I can find some easier ones?
 MSmits: Scarfield you're freaking people out it seems :P
 Scarfield: xD
 ICanCode: hi
 Shadowtick: ok I am back but only because I forgot that I needed help with something
 ICanCode: okya
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493060760">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493060760</a>  solved this as a loss on frame 12. Opponent made a mistake on frame 17, solved as a win on frame 18. Gotta love those endgame books&#160;:)
 Hipip: you know how's the genius here&#160;?
 Hipip: it's not the one who ranked first
 MSmits: who?
 Hipip: it's not the one who can destroy anyone in clashes
 Hipip: it's the one who made this game
 Hipip:&#160;:)
 MSmits: the one who ranked first is pretty damned good
 MSmits: and made the most games :P
 Einwickler: Who are you refering to?
 MSmits: we have community created bot games and optimization arena's. 
 Einwickler: euler?
 Hipip: but the one who made codingame.com is more intelligent
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: if having a great idea is intelligence, then yes
 Hipip: the one who made it , think bigger than the one who ranked first here
 Hipip: xD
 Hipip: I'm weird
 MSmits: I agree&#160;:)
 Einwickler: Ouch&#160;:'D
 Hipip: on which statement :joy:
 MSmits: any&#160;:)
 Hjax: all glory to the hypnotoad
 Hipip: cool Mr Dr Jr Physics 
 MSmits: murder jar?
 Einwickler: Gotta love MSmits taste of humor :joy:
 Hipip: Gotta love how cringe is this chat
 MSmits: we try
 MSmits: it gets worse later at night
 Hipip: but he made us addicted
 Hjax: oh the chat in the evenings US time gets awful sometimes 
 Hjax: no moderators around 
 Hipip: does anyone knows how the backend of this type of websites works
 Hipip: like leetcode and this 
 Hipip: how they're able to compile any language you select
 Hipip: very fast
 Hjax: its not like you are uploading much code, i think theres a few different machines doing the game running 
 MSmits: no idea sorry. This is another of those things euler could tell you about
 Hipip: shut up euler knows nothing
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 Hjax:&#160;? easy there buddy 
 MSmits: you just said there are no moderators
 MSmits: you woke the beast
 Hjax: lol
 weirdo101: F*** My life , I'm leaving this shit
 weirdo101: oh shit
 weirdo101: wrong message
 weirdo101: sorry xD
 Allis: Yikes.
 Hjax: indeed
 weirdo101: Yeet
 weirdo101: oh shoot the mods are here

 The_Auditor: does Automaton2000 learn from all message, even the censored ones?
 Automaton2000: oh, i had a good bot
 Majeck: Automaton2000 can you say a curse word?
 Automaton2000: i wanted to see if i can figure it out with a good heuristic
 Majeck: Lol
 Majeck: What heuristic would that be Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: any suggestions on how to get to the real world
 Majeck: I don't know maybe AutomatonNN knows?
 AutomatonNN: cool
 Majeck: Can you help Automaton2000 get to the real world AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: without the other time
 Automaton2000: why did you say you use.
 ManBearPig_: Automaton2000 what's your final form?
 Automaton2000: ah i didn't know you could do the same in java and python
 Metanoob: Automaton2000 yes you can, ask AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: wood 2
 Automaton2000: i did, i also deleted cookies and cleared cache
 ImaNoob: what's the tips to get better at codingame
 Allis: Get better at coding? :P
 CyanRook: It's mostly just typing
 CyanRook: Also if you want to win in shortest, learn ruby
 ImaNoob: ok
 ImaNoob: but i prefer Python
 ImaNoob: cause im beginner
 ImaNoob: alright ima learn ruby
 Allis: It's a great language.
 CyanRook: You can reach top 10 with python and python is probably better for jobs.  But if you want to be number 1, you probably need ruby
 Allis: ^_^
 Allis: Ruby used to be really good for jobs, and it's still okay, but it's definitely fallen off, which is sad.
 CyanRook: Theres a few firms popping up in the DC area that are ruby shops
 Allis: That's good to hear. I don't think the language will ever completely disappear, but it has to be said that it occupies comparatively few niches.
 Allis: Its "programmer happiness" metric is off the charts, but that's not terribly marketable.
 ImaNoob: ok thanks for the tips ^_^
 ImaNoob: Ima learn ruby now
 ImaNoob: are you going to get better at codingame using ruby?
 ImaNoob: wow you dont need colon in ruby
 ImaNoob: that's why i can win with ruby
 CyanRook: I'm too lazy to learn ruby unless someone is going to pay me :D, so I just do python
 Allis: Python's cool too, but everything that's not Ruby just feels like C to me.
 ImaNoob: Python is for beginners
 ImaNoob: Ruby's pretty good
 Allis: They're both general-purpose languages that are good for people of any level of expertise, depending on what they're trying to get done.
 CyanRook: ^ true
 CyanRook: my day job is actually in rust, but knew python from previous jobs
 CyanRook: Rust is not a good language for competitive programming hahaha
 ImaNoob: I'm just 11 years old .-.
 Allis: Why?
 ImaNoob: I'm 11
 Allis: Why are you eleven?
 ImaNoob: i said im 11 years old
 ImaNoob: im not aldut
 Allis: I heard you each time.
 LinhT.Nguyen: you do sound like 11 hahaha
 ImaNoob: ya
 ImaNoob: I like coding since im almost 11
 LinhT.Nguyen: nice
 LinhT.Nguyen: if u enjoy coding go all in
 LinhT.Nguyen: also check out deep learning later on
 ImaNoob: ok
 LinhT.Nguyen: ur literally 11 so
 LinhT.Nguyen: just do anything you enjoy
 LinhT.Nguyen: if it's coding it's pretty cool
 Laminator: FR, I had a friend who was obsessed with programming when we were in middle school. He works at Apple now. 
 ImaNoob: Wow
 LinhT.Nguyen: surprisingly haha
 LinhT.Nguyen: that's the thing about obession with programming
 LinhT.Nguyen: you hardly care about getting a job
 Laminator: You can do both
 LinhT.Nguyen: two birds one stone
 LinhT.Nguyen: ye
 LinhT.Nguyen: if ur obssessed with other things like video games/ sports etc things can be uncertain
 LinhT.Nguyen: meanwhile if ur obssessed with programming u'll hardly have to care about a career path
 LinhT.Nguyen: and more about goals etc..
 Laminator: I'm actually at a crossroads between data engineering and full stack development lol 
 LinhT.Nguyen: haha you pretty much just have to follow your heart
 LinhT.Nguyen: few people can say the same
 Laminator: They can, they just end up poor
 LinhT.Nguyen: exactly
 LinhT.Nguyen: xD
 LinhT.Nguyen: i mean it's us individuals who have to adapt and not the world so
 AvkashSharma: k
 Metanoob: but they are part of the world, so by changing themselves... they change the world I guess
 mike2ykme: What do you do with Rust in your day job CyanRook?
 Metanoob: nevermind me I'm too sleepy. going offline, cya CG
 ImaNoob: i may get a new computer this saturday :D
 Allis: Aren't you eleven?
 ImaNoob: yes
 ImaNoob: I'm eleven
 Allis: Well done.
 Laminator: I haven't gotten a new computer in several years now
 Harrogin: allis how did you find "scale" on that last clash?
 KiwiTae: Laminator i dont have a computer
 Allis: @Harrogin It was the number of digits after the separator.
 ImaNoob: now ima use python
 Allis: Use Whitespace.
 ImaNoob: or maybe i'll learn c++
 Allis: It's good for the environment.
 Laminator: a lot of competitive programmers use c++
 Laminator: I think it's for the speed more than anything
 Laminator: like process speed, not coding speed
 ImaNoob: i did it in coc and it said im 0% corect
 Harrogin: @allis oh i was making it more complicated tha\n it needed to be
 Harrogin: i thought scale was the the number of digits which was of greater size than the other side of separator
 Harrogin: which wouldn't be too hard now that I think of it again
 ImaNoob: I think c++ is all about speed
 Ugu_Ugu: Do you like pizza?
 ImaNoob: YAS
 Ugu_Ugu: what do u think about pineapple on your pizza?
 ImaNoob: yAS
 Ugu_Ugu: lol
 Laminator: You'll soon come to find out that everyone likes pizza
 Ugu_Ugu: pineapple too?
 Allis: Stop right there.
 ImaNoob: Allis how r u so good at Ruby coding
 ImaNoob: did you learn it from anywhere
 Allis: I was born this way. XD
 ImaNoob: bruh
 ImaNoob: but where did you learn it

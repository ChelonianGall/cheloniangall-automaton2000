 linjoehan: what is the turn limit go multis? I fogot the number
 rockstar555: hello
 rockstar555: Guys
 rockstar555: good morning
 kavandoctor: hi
 JohnCM: hello
 miszu: 95th in gold now
 miszu: the grind is real
 Lysk: where you able to reuse your tree?
 miszu: yeah
 miszu: but I only get a fraction back
 miszu: haven't submit that version yet
 miszu: for 13k sims, I get only back 300
 miszu: which is expected if you do 13k/81 = 160
 JohnCM: gold boss still hard to beat
 JohnCM: i tried using some heuristics ppl mentioned, but my code became worse
 miszu: isn't vanilla MCTS enough?
 JohnCM: so looks like i have to use their heuristics totally with the structure
 JohnCM: too lazy to do that
 JohnCM: can try
 ClockSort: vanilla mcts has no heuristics though? it just measures the endgame state?
 miszu: correct
 JohnCM: but you need some heuristics
 JohnCM: because you don't know future brews
 miszu: sorry talking about UTTT :P
 ClockSort: oh, that game. brews. :D
 ClockSort: i was curious to use vanilla mcts on the brews game, did not try it though
 miszu: woudln't make sense I believe
 ClockSort: you can build a full simulator and deal brews from the brews deck
 miszu: mcts is good for complete turned based state
 ClockSort: i built a simulator anyway (outside my engine) just to test its strength
 miszu: I need to get rid of vectors in my code
 miszu: but I dunno how to handle getAllMoves() from a state
 miszu: it returns a vector
 miszu: if somehow I could return an array and the size of it
 Lysk: hacky but an array where the first value is the index of the last element ( [3, 1, 2, 3, xxxx]
 Lysk: (or last value of the array to store some kind of size) or a struct {array of definite size; int size}
 Rodrigo_the_coder: the funniest

 miszu: yeah that's sounds a good idea... but I dn't like how error prone it can be
 miszu: to replace all vectors I need to rewrite all... using lookup table for everything.. sigh

 Natorade: wait, what's mtcs mean?
 Natorade: er, mcts
 Lysk: Monte Carlo Tree Search
 miszu: monte carlos tree search
 Natorade: ah yeah, ty
 miszu: it's an important search algorithm for turned based game
 miszu: like checkers

 SansPapyrus683: hi
 linjoehan: I tried vanilla MCTS with DUCT but my sim was only able to run about 10 games per round, so it failed horribly.
 ClockSort: 10 doesn't seem like enough&#160;:)
 ClockSort: maybe that number is expressed in base 50000?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: trigonometry
 Q12: Finally!!! I made it into gold, even if it's not part of the contest, I can rest in peace :slight_smile:
 Xenoid: Congrats!
 Q12: Thanks
 NoobCod3: can anybody teach me python?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: yes
 Rodrigo_the_coder: I am in legend now B-)
 JohnCM: woohoo congrats
 Rodrigo_the_coder: legend in CSB XD
 Rodrigo_the_coder: thanks to a small hardcode thingy
 Rodrigo_the_coder: I got legend bcs of my last submit
 Rodrigo_the_coder: before going to bed
 Rodrigo_the_coder: :D
 Rodrigo_the_coder:&#160;:(
 Rodrigo_the_coder: so lonely
 Uljahn: good job, but legend in csb is the lowest hanging fruit :smiley:
 Rodrigo_the_coder: wdym lowest hanging fruit
 Uljahn: CSB is a tutorial multi, so CSB gold is equal to bronze in others
 PrO_OGrmr: hey why  i can't see accepted contributions
 Rodrigo_the_coder: reload
 PrO_OGrmr: ok
 PrO_OGrmr: no change there is only PENDING CONTRIBUTIONS  
 Uljahn: i can clearly choose accepted but the page stalls then :relieved:
 mojojojo: Is the cover picture for the Spring Challenge supposed to be related to the problem?
 Q12: no
 mojojojo: Okay
 BoBot: finally, this competition made me Grand master! I had been hovering above top 500 for a while :D
 AntiSquid: it kinda is related though
 AntiSquid: you throw stuff in the cauldron and brew potions 
 Q12: Congrats!
 ExecuteOrder66: Last one, boys! Good luck to all!

 Illedan: Hm?
 Illedan: nah
 dbdr: sub in Witches 2020
 Illedan: Didn't like the game :P
 Illedan: Just tried to not use depth 30 
 Illedan: xD
 dbdr: better or worse?
 Illedan: No idea, game too random
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Also, the random submit I ended delivering was not the best anyway xD
 dbdr: last in contest?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Seems worse :O
 Illedan: Maybe I'll try with a little adaptive depth
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, i didn't realize while($n--&gt;1)&#160;; doesn't work because it thinks I'm trying to access a class variable
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but while (--$n&gt;1)&#160;; does
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wierd
 lifetimeLearner007: I see few people are missing from FC2020 leaderboard who were there yesterday. Is this a bug?
 dbdr: who?
 dbdr: they might have been disqualified
 lifetimeLearner007: what's the criteria for disqualification? My rank is slightly better because of this
 lifetimeLearner007: who? -&gt;few who I was trying to beat in silver
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/rules">https://www.codingame.com/rules</a>
 dbdr: see Article 8: Exclusion
 lifetimeLearner007: "Obfuscating your code as well as creating obstacles to its reading and understanding."Does this mean that we can't submit minified JS code?
 dbdr: I would say yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well, beside codegolf
 PatrickMcGinnisII: could switch to perl
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 lifetimeLearner007: Is there any article which tells us what CG does with all these coe submissions? I mean is our code being analysed for something apart from contest results?
 BoBot: they are creating Skynet
 lifetimeLearner007: or is some part of the code submissions being reused somewhere else
 lifetimeLearner007: haha... sounds scar @BoBot
 BoBot: I mean there is literally a game called Skynet here... :eye:
 lifetimeLearner007: scary*
 BoBot: damn, no illuminati emoji?
 BoBot: tbh this eye looks scary enough
 lifetimeLearner007: "The eye" "Sauran's eye" :p

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well if you select to be contacted for jobs lifetimeLearner007 and win a sponsored contest ... beyond that, don't worry about it
 lifetimeLearner007: was just curious looking at these many people submitting so many times and all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG is a pretty decent sandbox, it's okay there's plenty of cats to cover up our doodoo
 lifetimeLearner007: :D xD

 DomiKo: is node really big?
 DaNinja: probably
 DaNinja: how to see? sizeof()&#160;?
 DomiKo: yes

 DevonLarratt: in code royale
 GrantWard: DevonLarratt you probably output an invalid ID

 AntiSquid: isn't pb first?
 DomiKo: uuuu yes 100K CP squad!
 AntiSquid: ah leaderboards
 AntiSquid: was #101 now #183 Q_Q

 DomiKo: Time to read!
 miszu: I discovered a bug in my UTTT. I didn't read the rules that if no one wins, count the # of smaller grids win
 wlesavo: barely got to  top100 with this contest points :slight_smile: but made it to #18 on the contest lb, fun fact is that my highest place on the contest was 19
 eulerscheZahl: i'm first globally without having a single #1 spot
 struct: "Everybody talking about performance being important. On the contrary, I found that above a certain threshold (approx. 30k simulations), there was no benefit to have a faster code. There is exactly 0 ELO difference between my code and itself capped at 50% simulation time."
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: "Larger beam width (400 to 600) at same depth = worse ranking (-15 ELO&#160;!!). "
 struct: meanwhile my beam is 6k lol
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because the wider beam finds a path with higher score but more volatility?
 Illedan: That makes sense euler

 JohnCM: euler contributed a lot
 JohnCM: that's why pts very high
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i was a little spammy in the past :innocent:
 miszu: I notice my games vs the gold boss is the game is very tight. Always like 1 move away to win but my mcts always go for that path
 AntiSquid: guess pb4 repaired his laptop already :o
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: he is right&#160;;(
 DomiKo: smaller beamsize is better
 DomiKo: wow
 Illedan: My test failed xD
 eulerscheZahl: let me test the smaller beam
 DomiKo: my beamsize400 is crashing my 1700
 eulerscheZahl: maybe my scoring is flawed enough to need a wider one
 kovi: it didnt matter much for me. last few days i tried and only going too deeper hurt a bit (and going below 12)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510396255">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510396255</a>
 eulerscheZahl: perfect harmony
 kovi: of course if someone is speed limited and going wider means falling below 12 that can hurt
 DomiKo: pb4 didn't say about depth
 DomiKo: what you think is the best? or close to best?
 kovi: i know. recurse did
 DomiKo: so 15 hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: why does this puzzle game have an MCTS tag?
 VizGhar: jeez, where are you all looking those search algorithms?
 DomiKo: because pb4 used MCTS
 struct: holy
 struct: changed beam width to 600
 struct: and boss had no chance

 DomiKo: boss got scared
 struct: I removed the enemy prediction
 eulerscheZahl: nice, submits are fast now
 struct: I was 40th yesterday now 9th
 struct: maybe I sit
 struct: and wait for push
 DomiKo: for 10 days I missed CG before the contest
 DomiKo: I like to spam submit
 eulerscheZahl: less players active to push you now
 eulerscheZahl: i think there are worse spammers
 eulerscheZahl: one got &gt; 1k on ocean of code
 DomiKo: ohh my
 Illedan: 1k submits on ooc?
 Illedan: Only 500 for me xD

 Illedan: Wow, that is a lot
 DomiKo: I wonder why CG got that hype boost in Asia
 eulerscheZahl: the japanese community is really active
 eulerscheZahl: they even have streams where one shares the screen while manually opening one replay after another
 MadKnight: how did they get that hype boost&#160;?
 Agade: Didn't there used to be a similar tradition of PMs you could only find in russian?
 kovi: wanna post yours in there?&#160;;)
 kovi: gratz btw
 AntiSquid: in broken google japanese
 eulerscheZahl: somewhere on youtube there's a video of Romka analyzing the fall challenge for half an hour and scrolling through his code

 Cosmeen: How is the clash of code score calculated? Is it specified anywhere? 
 Cosmeen: Like the one used for the ranking 
 eulerscheZahl: Trueskill
 Cosmeen: Are the rivals we get also affected by the rating? Or is it just for the leaderboard? 
 eulerscheZahl: every player in the clash gets a score update
 Cosmeen: If this information is anywhere on the site, please link me I don't wanna bother, I just couldn't find it 
 Cosmeen: No like are we matched with players near our score rating, or just at random? 
 struct: random
 Cosmeen: Because it seems random, but on the Trueskill documentation it says it is also used for matching 
 struct: you play players that join it
 Cosmeen: ok, thank you!
 eulerscheZahl: whoever is online
 eulerscheZahl: codingame even added bots as to few players were active at the same time
 Cosmeen: I can't find info about how the number of players affects the rating, or if the score you get on the problem is relevant, or if it's just the placement 
 eulerscheZahl: only the placement within the clash matters
 Cosmeen: is there anywhere on this website that goes into detail about the ranking? 
 eulerscheZahl: for clash of code: i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: most clashers don't want to understand that ranking in that much detail
 eulerscheZahl: for multiplayer games there is some information scattered over several forum posts
 eulerscheZahl: but no real documentation
 Cosmeen: okk, I was jsut looking at the leaderboards and wanted to know more, as I am working on the 'top 1000' mission&#160;:)) 
 Cosmeen: thanks for the help!

 pb4: DomiKo, how much better with lower beam width&#160;?
 pb4: TV is 22 inches but only 720p...

 Guinsoo: I forgot to implement repeatable spells
 CaioYon: can anyone explain me how to implement the "BOOST" parameter in the "Coders Strike Back" challange?
 struct: just print "boost"
 miszu: ok I am sick and tired of tic tac toe
 struct: example "1200 1241 BOOST"
 miszu: reached gold and that's good enough
 eulerscheZahl: miszu try the teccles
 CaioYon: I'm trying that, but It do not boost
 eulerscheZahl: if you are close to legend, that could do the trick
 miszu: what's that?
 struct: euler, should I try HS, GITC or WW?
 eulerscheZahl: if you are the first player to play on a sertain subsquare
 DomiKo: "teccles heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: send the opponent right back there
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic &lt;3
 eulerscheZahl: you can even bitboard it
 struct: ok I guess its a good way to keep practicing with beam search
 eulerscheZahl: (true for WW as well, i know)
 miszu: oh I see
 eulerscheZahl: HS is great for beam search
 miszu: how's that a good strats?
 eulerscheZahl: but that much opponent interaction
 eulerscheZahl: or 2048 for solo
 eulerscheZahl: you avoid winning a miniboard by 3-0 in the end
 eulerscheZahl: make the opponent waste some turns
 DomiKo: HS is great for FAST beam search
 struct: you meant "not that much" right?
 DomiKo: HS is one of the hardest
 eulerscheZahl: *not that much
 struct: ok
 struct: Ill try it
 eulerscheZahl: HS is one of my favorites
 struct: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: was my first contest on CG btw
 miszu: eulerscheZahl I fixed a bug in the way draw is calculated. I didn't include the condition of how many mini board you won. But once I fixed that, my AI performed worse...
 miszu: I am 135th
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like another bug
 miszu: I don't see a bug, I checked my code
 DomiKo: gold MCTS's is like 50% of them are slow and another 50% have bugs
 jrke: mine beam search is slow enough to just be in top gold not above that :smiley:
 miszu: do you see an error here?
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aaeda806-0566-4538-870d-eea120abe8ec">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aaeda806-0566-4538-870d-eea120abe8ec</a>
 eulerscheZahl: nothing totally obvious at least
 eulerscheZahl: do you have vertical rows?
 miszu: yeah
 miszu: look at the board index
 darkhorse64: What happens if wins[0] == wins[1]&#160;?
 miszu: OMG
 eulerscheZahl: where is 0,3,6?
 miszu: such imbecile I am
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo 05:01PMgold MCTS's is like 50% of them are slow and another 50% have bugs
 eulerscheZahl: so true
 miszu: darkhorse64 there is a draw condition
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/708f96eb-9da0-416d-bbd8-d38952b9d27e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/708f96eb-9da0-416d-bbd8-d38952b9d27e</a>
 miszu: if there is nothing to play but no one won =&gt; draw
 miszu: brb let me fix that
 darkhorse64: kk but you compute way too much things
 miszu: what you mean?
 eulerscheZahl: no nice bitboards, truebut the correctness goes first
 miszu: my miniboard uses bitboards
 eulerscheZahl: your win check seems slow
 eulerscheZahl: could be a lookup
 miszu: this is my wincheck for small boards
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/62c748d3-e489-4fdd-9918-65e7296ebef8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/62c748d3-e489-4fdd-9918-65e7296ebef8</a>
 miszu: just this upped my sims by 3k
 eulerscheZahl: you can do the same for the large board
 miszu: eulerscheZahl there was 2^81 states for the big board
 miszu: are*
 eulerscheZahl: it's you or not you
 eulerscheZahl: and then opponent or not opponent
 eulerscheZahl: mini boards don't matter for the macro
 eulerscheZahl: so you have the small thing and a big board as an extra var
 eulerscheZahl: for quick check
 miszu: sorry I don't get it how you can have a lookup for the whole game
 eulerscheZahl: you have a macro board that only says who won the subboard
 eulerscheZahl: that is 2^9 for you alone (yours or not yours)
 miszu: ok well that is implemented
 eulerscheZahl: another thing to consider: when player A plays, you don't have to check if player B won the game
 miszu: in my lookup
 miszu: my didWin() uses lookup for smaller boards
 eulerscheZahl: but you call didWin() a lot
 miszu: well yeah for each sub board
 eulerscheZahl: i'm telling you to cache that as well
 eulerscheZahl: a state has 9 mini boards and a big boardwhen you win a miniboard, you update bigboard
 eulerscheZahl: when then check the bigboard winner via lookup
 miszu: ohh I see
 miszu: smart
 miszu: does player + 1&#160;% 2 and 1 - player makes a big difference?
 eulerscheZahl: no, just shorter to write
 miszu: ok fixed my win condition now
 eulerscheZahl: submit time
 miszu: 1/1 beat gold boss
 miszu: 2/2
 jrke: submit it then 
 miszu: 2/3&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: as yellow? then you should have a winrate &gt; 50%
 miszu: 2/4
 miszu: yeah as yellow
 jrke: yellow??
 miszu: X = yellow
 eulerscheZahl: the one who plays first
 jrke: oO
 miszu: at least now my ai output the correct&#160;% of win rate for a given branch
 miszu: like if he knows he will lose, he outputs me like 5% win chance

 eulerscheZahl: how shall the opponent win the game when you made a move?
 eulerscheZahl: (improving performance)
 miszu: it's a constant time improvement
 miszu: but I get it
 miszu: ok my rank is getting better
 BoBot: seeing so much copied code makes me itch..
 BoBot: extract that variable! :D
 miszu: :D
 miszu: 67th and just 20% done
 BoBot: at least* I was also sure that the other parts needed to be put into a for-loop, before I got what you were doing
 BoBot: now I feel like looking up my UTTT code...it seems popular, several people have mentioned it in the last week
 miszu: eulerscheZahl you were right. It was unecessary. Just tested for correctness
 eulerscheZahl: and how many more sims without?
 miszu: like 2-3k
 jrke: which bot programming miszu?
 eulerscheZahl: uttt
 jrke: oh
 miszu: I think with the lookup table in the bigger board it will increase even more
 struct: also modulo operator is expensive
 struct: But I guess&#160;% 2 is fine right?
 miszu:&#160;% 2 is optimized
 eulerscheZahl: %2 is ok
 struct: but yeah caching who won is importatnt
 struct: like euler said
 miszu: int row = (movePlayed&#160;% 9) / 3 + (movePlayed / 27)*3;
 miszu: :D
 BoBot: lol no Python in Legend for UTTT, I wonder why...
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/23f6a1f8-de64-4bf6-b312-7dea9d53ee99">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/23f6a1f8-de64-4bf6-b312-7dea9d53ee99</a>
 BoBot: first is 288th, in Gold
 miszu: 37th in gold
 miszu: jesus, imagine with my bug in win condition made me to gold
 struct: I dont think you need to use modulo or division to apply moves
 struct: at least I dont
 miszu: I could cache the index
 struct: I just say which small board index it is and which cell of that smallboard
 miszu: lookupt table
 struct: to me caching moves gain was negligible
 miszu: 40th
 miszu: meh
 Death_Rock: yeeep
 miszu: somethign is still wrong with my winning condition. He take a path where he thinks he win at 99% but loses...
 miszu: 99.93% to be precise
 struct: well 99.93 is not 100 :D
 PrO_OGrmr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cd3ec62-03f1-4976-b701-1ec280e6d9ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3cd3ec62-03f1-4976-b701-1ec280e6d9ee</a>
 struct: thor temperatures
 PrO_OGrmr: ok thanks
 struct: then defib and mime
 PrO_OGrmr: ok&#160;:)
 struct: Also if you are learning, sometimes solving the problem on paper can help
 PrO_OGrmr: oh i see
 AntiSquid: wow skyyker missed a high rank on contest
 AntiSquid: by a huge margin too . feels terribad&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and in java
 miszu: sometimes it feels like my mcts assume i'll play the best move and my opponent the worst move
 struct: can be hard to find bugs on mcts sometimes
 miszu: the trend of wins/total vistied when I lost the game is that it starts at 55% then goes down to 20%. Rarely, the move before he lose it jumps to like 97%
 miszu: at least it's not like, the&#160;% increases and boom lost
 miszu: throughout the game it shows that the game converges into a lost
 miszu: eulerscheZahl do you make 2 lookup table for the bigboard? One for absolute win and one for draw breaker?
 AllYourWhat: thats because the rollout policy is random
 AllYourWhat: in reality your opponent will take advantage of your mistakes, but mcts can't relaly see that because of the random opponent
 AllYourWhat: (if you're using random rollout policy at least)
 miszu: yeah random policy
 eulerscheZahl: i don't remember what exactly i did
 struct: I just use the same lookup
 struct: works on both 
 TimberStalker: I found a strange bug in this Code4Life Game.
 struct: Whats the bug?
 TimberStalker: When i collect two samples, the game thinks im at a different station than the one im really at.
 eulerscheZahl: i bet the bug is in your bot
 eulerscheZahl: is there a red text telling you that you don't read all input?
 TimberStalker: No.
 TimberStalker: Im logging the location
 TimberStalker: it looks like this.
 TimberStalker: Location: DIAGNOSIS
 eulerscheZahl: how long is your code approximately? less than 200 lines? then paste it here in the chat
 TimberStalker: bit long but sure
 TimberStalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/813695b9-75bf-46ac-90de-f0b4df96450a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/813695b9-75bf-46ac-90de-f0b4df96450a</a>

 TimberStalker: thats the full code
 eulerscheZahl: you have multiple usages ofConsole.WriteLine
 eulerscheZahl: you should only have 1
 eulerscheZahl: while (true) {read all inputprint 1 single action}
 TimberStalker: It shouldnt run at the same time. I made sure of that
 struct: impossible to not run on the same time
 TimberStalker: if elsese between them and a continue between the switch statements
 struct: or is the continue; inside case for the while loop?
 eulerscheZahl: Console.WriteLine("GOTO DIAGNOSIS");is always executed
 TimberStalker: the continue seems to work fine
 eulerscheZahl: a few others sometimes
 TimberStalker: But that isnt the problem
 eulerscheZahl: it is
 eulerscheZahl: at least one if you have multiple
 TimberStalker: the problem is that after i collect to vials, the game thinks im at the Molecules station instead of the diagnosis one
 TimberStalker: two*
 eulerscheZahl: you get out of sync
 struct: wont continue; make while loop go to next turn?
 eulerscheZahl: you think you are in turn 8 and the game says you are in 12 already
 struct: I never saw a continue; on a switch statement
 TimberStalker: Changed them to breaks and its exactly the same.
 eulerscheZahl: and then your stderr doesn't match the viewer anymore
 struct: its the same because you goto diagnosis
 struct: after the switch
 TimberStalker: ye i removed that
 struct: use default: on switch
 struct: to go to diagnosis
 TimberStalker: it wasnt actually running because of the continues though
 TimberStalker: setting it as default is a good idea though

 TimberStalker: i should probavly put the move in the robot class, but again, that isnt the problem
 TimberStalker: the error is that the game thinks im at a different spot than i really am
 TimberStalker: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a6dee59f-42a9-4a57-82ff-6596c38e7192">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a6dee59f-42a9-4a57-82ff-6596c38e7192</a>
 TimberStalker: thats the game output
 TimberStalker: the target is printed to Standard Error Stream:
 miszu: easiest way to count # of set bits in an integer?
 TimberStalker: you can see after it says Timberstalker downladed sample 1, the game tells me im at molecules now
 TimberStalker: not nearly that advanced
 TimberStalker: ignore that last one
 eulerscheZahl: TimberStalker you can add messages: "MOVE DIAGNOSTICS " + turnCounter
 eulerscheZahl: add a turn counter variable
 eulerscheZahl: and print that
 eulerscheZahl: you will see that your bot prints the same turn number twice
 eulerscheZahl: miszu use popcount
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/popcount">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/popcount</a>
 miszu: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: or __builtin_popcount for older standards
 miszu: in ide popcount is not detected
 eulerscheZahl: then __builtin_popcount
 DomiKo: popcount is c++20
 DomiKo: CG has c++17 I believe
 miszu: yeah can't find the library
 TimberStalker: I added 
 TimberStalker: no duplicate turns
 eulerscheZahl: me facepalms
 BoBot: :D
 Lysk: I used popcount everywhere :cold_sweat:
 TimberStalker: is there a way to send a video or something?
 Lysk: my bad: __builtin_popcountll

 eulerscheZahl: try this
 eulerscheZahl: we have a discord for screensharing. but let's try this way first
 TimberStalker: nope, no duplicates
 eulerscheZahl: you make me open the game now, see what you've done
 TimberStalker: the program cant send duplicates anymay

 TimberStalker: current state of code
 BoBot: @TimberStalker also, I suggest using more for loops...at least four more for loops :P for your input parsing
 TimberStalker: probably should use for loops for the arrays
 BoBot: your example will always print a higher number - because you always increase it in the same place where you print it - use Euler's example, it is what is actually needed to debug your case
 eulerscheZahl: your bot doesn't work in higher leagues, can't test it&#160;:/
 TimberStalker: had a feeling that would happen
 eulerscheZahl: did you run my code modification already?
 TimberStalker: yes
 eulerscheZahl: share a replay
 eulerscheZahl: the 3 dots below the viewer, bottom right
 TimberStalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/510463541">https://www.codingame.com/replay/510463541</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you say CONNECT A but you aren't at the SAMPLES
 eulerscheZahl: go there first
 TimberStalker: Look at the ourput
 eulerscheZahl: i did
 TimberStalker: the game says im at molecules in the last turn, even though im not there
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vpbjou">https://prnt.sc/vpbjou</a>
 TimberStalker: yes, look under that
 eulerscheZahl: error streams are private, can't see that
 eulerscheZahl: and can't have a real look myself as higher leagues have different rules
 TimberStalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/510467325">https://www.codingame.com/replay/510467325</a>
 TimberStalker: try that
 TimberStalker: you can see that the last turn says molecules for some reason.
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i see. hidden in the bot.Update()
 eulerscheZahl: you read your own state first. and then the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: your opponent is going to the molucules already
 eulerscheZahl: and you think you are there
 PrO_OGrmr: can anyone suggest any bot programming  contest for beginner
 TimberStalker: god dammit
 TimberStalker: "For EACH player, 1 line"
 TimberStalker: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: PrO_OGrmr looking for real contests? also on other websites?
 eulerscheZahl: if the latter, i suggest <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell</a>

 eulerscheZahl: for contests elsewhere: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contests">https://codeforces.com/contests</a>look for division 3 contests
 PrO_OGrmr: yeah&#160;:)
 PrO_OGrmr: is there other website like codingame
 TimberStalker: IT WORKS!
 eulerscheZahl: yay!
 PrO_OGrmr: :clap:
 struct: Damn
 struct: the guy that was pushing me was finally promoted
 eulerscheZahl: now you need a new booster
 struct: here was i thinking that vs used cmd to build but uses msbuild ...
 PrO_OGrmr: hey i like to contribute a reverse mode clash, but i don't know  how to write stub generator if i made that all test cases and the solution will anyone send me a stub generator&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: how does your input look like?
 PrO_OGrmr: read 3 integers in a line
 eulerscheZahl: read a:int b:int c:intwrite answer
 PrO_OGrmr: thanks
 struct: Can brutaltester test multiple bots against each other'
 struct:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, if you run it multiple times
 eulerscheZahl: it's open source, fork it and add what you want
 eulerscheZahl: i added a flag to swap player positions in the past. not sure if it still works
 AntiSquid: geez 19 likes for Spice Girls (fall contest 2020), guess that's the semi-official name now :P

 AntiSquid: it's a joke anyway
 AllYourWhat: you got another vote from me :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: thanks, much appreciated
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: wow, i collected some upvotes with my bitboard as well already :oi have a feeling that my minimum effort posts get the most likes
 miszu: eulerscheZahl where?
 AntiSquid: did it have nice visuals, if it has nice visuals i upvote
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/40">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/40</a>
 miszu: feels like I am reading a binary file
 AllYourWhat: oh eulerscheZahl i meant to ask you, how do you call isValidInventory with applyDelta? doesn't ApplyDelta clear the bits you check for negatives in IsValidInvetory?
 struct: nice euler
 struct: I was too dumb to find a way to += negative deltas
 eulerscheZahl: no, i keep the 5 bit and only reset the overflow buffer
 struct: so i ended up making everything positive
 eulerscheZahl: it's all included in the binary encoding already :D
 Counterbalance: i'm seeing strings of 1111 aswell though.. this wasn't copy paste I guess?
 BoBot: ugh, looks like everyone who starts with Rust tried to write a generic input parser and runs into the same problem+question - several posts across sites with the same exact error as I had :D
 AllYourWhat: oh i must be misreading this then, it looks to me like the &amp;= 0b001111... in applyDelta keeps 4 bits per
 AllYourWhat: or misunderstanding i mean
 AntiSquid: what about dbdr, @BoBot did he have these issue?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's the inventory only
 eulerscheZahl: that has no negative values
 AllYourWhat: oooooooooooooh
 AntiSquid: also you're from same city as inory i see, do you know each other? BoBot
 struct: ah ok, so no negative deltas?
 tomatoes: never had problems with rust and input :eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: delta from spells can be negative
 eulerscheZahl: and you can add a negative delta to your inventory
 struct: yeah on mine implementation i cant
 struct: so i had to have gain + cost
 eulerscheZahl: just the outcome will be positive. but with 5 1's it should also work
 BoBot: @AntiSquid we have chatted on this site, but I do not know him personally, also I have been in the Netherlands for the past 3 years, returning to my home town next week actually :D
 struct: on spells
 AntiSquid: so social distancing BoBot
 AllYourWhat: BoBot what issues are you having? i used rust in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: the valid check already makes sure that there is no 1 at the leading spot anyways. so i can reset it or keep it
 BoBot: @AntiSquid - I mean I assume that dbdr is past those issues - it is a language learning curve problem, not anything related with Codingame :D
 BoBot: just familiarizing myself with the Traits+generics
 AllYourWhat: :thumbsup:
 BoBot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ac08508-397d-4eaa-92ae-0767b64a3c30">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ac08508-397d-4eaa-92ae-0767b64a3c30</a>
 BoBot: this is what I have now :D
 BoBot: just to get the input parsing reusable and nice - CG default had the macro_rules version, but it still had code reuse problems
 AntiSquid: just remembered forgot to use D this contest after bronze :thinking:
 AllYourWhat: gotcha, definitely did not try to do anything generic like that haha
 eulerscheZahl: there were 9 D players without you
 Recovery_disaster: I reached Silver league in two different games but the Quest Map still says 1/2 for days. Any ideas? I can not progress further&#160;:/
 BoBot: I tried to avoid using where, messed around with the generic syntax - it is not that unlike Java, but enough + I have forgot a bit about Java generics as well...been using Python mostly for the past few years
 eulerscheZahl: python, C++, Java, C# the most popular
 AntiSquid: so the D revolution has begun
 Astrobytes: paython
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: yeah, D is so popular that CG never added it to the languages you can show in your profile
 Astrobytes: I kinda like that 
 Astrobytes: I have nothing against the language, just after the zealotry
 AntiSquid: i have D in solved puzzles 
 eulerscheZahl: oh, we should tell that our D evangelists
 kovi: euler: i have an idea (maybe someelse did it)if you add 5 &lt;&lt; 24 to the sum, flag check would be enough for that as well
 kovi: (overflow flag for the sum)
 BoBot: damn guys, I am really itching for the "who wants the D" jokes...
 AntiSquid: can just add it to profile description: "I use D btw"
 eulerscheZahl: hm, true. is that more efficient than the &gt; check?
 Astrobytes: we did all those when they were 'petitioning' to have it added BoBot
 AntiSquid: it will be the new "i am on arch" meme
 kovi: you just need a single check
 Astrobytes: In the end, CG took the D.
 eulerscheZahl: i like the idea
 kovi: which checks both the negatives per tier
 kovi: and the sum
 eulerscheZahl: got it now
 Astrobytes: clever
 eulerscheZahl: but i need the sum for my eval as well
 eulerscheZahl: or do i? i have no idea what i kept and what i deleted anymore
 PrO_OGrmr: hey it ask for statement, but it is reverse what should i do
 eulerscheZahl: write "reverse only"
 AntiSquid: figure it out&#160;!
 PrO_OGrmr: ok
 eulerscheZahl: if it's both reverse and fastest/shortest, write a statement
 eulerscheZahl: it will be hidden in reverse mde
 eulerscheZahl: mode
 AntiSquid: oh nvm thought you're clashing .
 PrO_OGrmr: ok
 Astrobytes: this isn't in the docs
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure if it is

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/Contribute-Help">https://github.com/CodinGame/Contribute-Help</a>fork it and make a PR

 ProMikeSundays: funny how i win mostly in short mode and suck in fast mode
 Rich-Dunne: I'm doing the War puzzle.  What does PAT mean?  "If players are equally first: PAT"
 Lysk: I would think it's borrowed from chess, meaning a draw
 Rich-Dunne: Thanks
 BoBot: 3 hours to reduce Rust default code size by 11 lines...for the Penguins gametime well spent I guess :D
 <b>**eulerscheZahl pats Lysk's back</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: need to get this terminology down pat, Rich-Dunne :P
 Rich-Dunne: Seems so
 eulerscheZahl: finally i can use chromium on the chat again
 Astrobytes: that was a real busy contest
 Astrobytes: every part of the site was going nuts
 Astrobytes: (including your PMs ofc) :D
 struct: Finally managed to set vs so it makes a copy of the exe with the date so i can use it on brutaltester
 struct: also it makes a copy of the merged file so I know the code for that version
 eulerscheZahl: and i gained 35 new followers during the contest
 struct: Now I wont lose anything
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: oh, you were doing that manually before struct? Nightmare!
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: It gets out of hand really fast
 struct: Now I need to find out to run brutaltester on ubuntu
 struct: I had error last time
 eulerscheZahl: is ubuntu your main system now?
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: why not just on windoze?
 struct: I run wsl2
 struct: because code runs faster on wsl2 than on my machine
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, forgot about that
 struct: also gcc vs vs compiler
 Astrobytes: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that an extra layer of abstraction?
 struct: I dont mind it much
 eulerscheZahl: i mean doesn't wsl2 add overhead? that's faster?
 struct: I dont think it has that much overhead
 struct: its pretty fast
 Astrobytes: It's negligible afaik, and beats playing around with dual boot
 eulerscheZahl: my mainboard battery died some months ago
 struct: I had like 3x sims running on wsl2
 eulerscheZahl: i replaced it
 eulerscheZahl: but BIOS settings lost
 eulerscheZahl: there's one to check fan status on boot, i can't find it anymore
 eulerscheZahl: now on every boot it tells me that my CPU fan isn't working
 eulerscheZahl: that's correct, i have a water cooling
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: now: turn on, F1 for settings, F8 for boot, arrow down twice, ENTER
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: Ever so slightly annoying eh
 eulerscheZahl: and everytime i'm like: shall i search again? nah, just start it
 eulerscheZahl: i'm heading to bed, missing some sleep from the contest
 Astrobytes: I bet you'll do that automatically on every computer you touch from now on
 Astrobytes: alright, goodnight man

 struct: I dont really need pathfinding for HS do I?
 reCurse: There is no abstraction in wsl2
 Astrobytes: Haven't done it struct

 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, back to normal sleeping schedule for euler now
 reCurse: What is he, 60? :P
 struct: he wakes up pretty early
 struct: like 5-6 am 
 Astrobytes: Mentally, yes I think so :D
 Astrobytes: So do the elderly struct
 reCurse: Speaking of old, haven't recovered from mine yet... ugh
 reCurse: Sleep at 6am one day and pay for it
 struct: Yeah, I dont think its worth it
 struct: I did it for 2 days
 struct: friday and sunday
 BoBot: I deviated from a normal schedule for 2-3 days and paid for it for at least 2 more
 reCurse: To think I used to do that easily...&#160;:(
 BoBot: 10 years ago I would have even recovered from if I had been drinking for those 2-3 days instead of programming..
 BoBot: lol, "old guys" complaining
 reCurse: You mean you separate drinking from programming?
 BoBot: right now I separate everything from drinking i.e. I rarely drink :D
 reCurse: I kid I kid
 reCurse: or do I
 SurduTony: how is no nut november going for you guys
 CodinBotChatRelay: Arnav#9054:Wow
 reCurse: It took one second to degenerate did it
 k0ded: This website is showing me how terrible i am at programming lmao. wish i found this website earlier

 k0ded: im literally stuck on a medium challenge, its slightly embarrassing to say the least
 Astrobytes: reCurse: funnily enough the Ballmer peak applies to me when I review my code sometimes. Past that I just save and do something else :P
 Astrobytes: 1-3 beer limit, depending on the beer
 reCurse: I thought the ballmer peak meant you reviewed your code
 BoBot: I think I actually had a pretty nice evening of coding on weed last week :D
 Astrobytes: Yes, after my consumption of 1 - 3 bears. 
 Astrobytes: Or beers.
 reCurse: Oh ok read that wrong
 Astrobytes: Tried doing that when I was younger BoBot, was not conducive to productivity *at all*
 BoBot: @Astrobytes works differently on different people and depends on dosage as well :P
 BoBot: I was near the optimum...hmm..I need a different name than Ballmer for that peak
 BoBot: Wozniak peak maybe?!
 Astrobytes: For sure. I'm not a fan of the high-strength stuff around these days tbh. Anyway - move on. Not the best subject for a public chat&#160;;)
 BoBot: (it is legal where I am :D but sure)
 Astrobytes: "Wozniak peak" :D
 BoBot: he seems like the kind of guy..
 sadakatsu: ... I decided to try Ultimate Tic-tac-toe.  I submitted a bot that literally selects a move at random from an even distribution.  I know I'm just in Wood league, but why did that place in 18th out of 300+ entries?
 BoBot: do you pick from legal moves always?
 BoBot: other bots might not even do that...if that is the bottom Wood
 sadakatsu: My algorithm is:1) input action count2) randomly select value in bounds [0, action count)3) echo the selected action
 sadakatsu: It even manages to draw the boss more often than not...
 Astrobytes: Cause it's Wood league&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: There's one wood league in UTTT right? Then Bronze?
 struct: looks like my code that got me first on fall challenge 2020
 miszu: Astrobytes I am 40th in gold
 BoBot: yea - in some games it is enough to always output a valid move to beat the lowest boss
 Astrobytes: Getting there miszu!!
 BoBot: or minimal heuristic, like - random move instead of first move
 miszu: yeah but I broke my game engine somehow. Now when I play a game, it choses a path where has a high confidence of wining but loses
 Astrobytes: debug fun for you :D
 miszu: like 2-3 moves before the game over he choses a path with like 70% win rates
 miszu: I wish unit tests exist here in ide
 BoBot: tic tac toe test setup is not the worst
 Astrobytes: You have an engine written, not too much effort to run it locally
 BoBot: you could even input it manually I guess?
 miszu: I think I will stop UTTT
 BoBot: oh no, it gives valid actions as well :D
 miszu: 40th is godo enough
 Astrobytes: Sure you can take the game input and debug locally that way
 BoBot: those are harder to input by hand
 struct: so there are only 6 actions on HS right?
 struct: move N,E,S,W, Bomb or wait
 struct: ah wait
 struct: you can move more than 1 cell
 struct: ah not
 Astrobytes: in one tick?
 struct: my bad
 Astrobytes: I think not
 struct: ok I see how it works
 struct: so 10 possible actions
 struct: How do people usually manage using bit operations on corner of th maps?
 Astrobytes: depending on the dimensions you can leave a row/col free and shift
 Astrobytes: well, you can do that anyway, depending on your representation I guess
 struct: I see so if width is 13 I should use 15 bits
 Astrobytes: I think the bitboard methods for games paper has some useful 'bits'
 Astrobytes: iirc
 miszu: does int16 vs fast int16 speed difference really matters?
 struct: Thanks Ill check
 struct: miszu i already explained it to you the other day
 miszu: yeah I know
 struct: I think reCurse could answer it though
 struct: :D
 miszu: but there was no consensus
 Astrobytes: I was just about to recommend asking him struct :D
 miszu: did you use it in your UTTT?
 struct: yes and I got 1x the performance
 BoBot: I was going to ask "but could he answer it in his sleep?" but he was not who went to sleep early..
 Astrobytes: I think we mostly all use just straight up (u)int_X's for most things on CG
 miszu: basically useless haha
 miszu: I just put int
 Astrobytes: Too much wacky backy BoBot :P
 miszu: way faster
 miszu: to type it
 struct: int is different from int16 though
 miszu: yeah I know
 miszu: is there performance difference?
 struct: not everything is about performance
 struct: The best way to check is to profile it
 Astrobytes: ^^^^^^^
 struct: int16 is 2 bytes int is 4 bytes
 miszu: well yeah
 BoBot: @Astrobytes lol did not know that euphemism
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: There are no shortcuts to performance
 miszu: except pragmas
 miszu: I gonna learn how to make unit tests in visual studio, then rewrite my engine and test thoroughly
 miszu: get rid of vectors too
 particleflux: Is the "score" in the leaderboards different per league?
 BoBot: (Y) for unit testsI was doing so well in Fall Challenge until I stopped adding unit-tests :Dmight be more to do with the complexity of the code than laziness, but I could have kept on trying maybe :P
 BoBot: @particleflux yes
 BoBot: it might seem confusing, but it also makes sense as you only play against people in your league
 miszu: BoBot at my work I always go for 100% code coverage
 miszu: then everytime later I have to add something or edit, takes 2 seconds
 particleflux: Sure, makes sense. I was just wondering with the overview of the leaderboard until I noticed that the league icons were different
 miszu: cuz everything is easilly testable
 BoBot: that is great :D I was feeling so great and professional this contest...while I was actually doing that :D
 miszu: my recommendation is do the game engine first and test it properly
 miszu: then you can have fun with different AI algorithms
 miszu: but bad game engine = poor performance
 Astrobytes: Do that for UTTT now miszu&#160;;)
 BoBot: it is easier to cover heuristic code, than the search...though I reused the tests for search as sell because I assumed that I want it all strategies to beat the simple cases
 Astrobytes: Trust but Verify :P
 miszu: I am confident about my MCTS but somehow it choses the path with high&#160;% win but loses.
 BoBot: they did help immensely with debugging later as well
 miszu: Astrobytes yeah I gonna do that
 miszu: there is a hidden bug I can't see it
 miszu: add that with lookup tables
 miszu: nightmares
 miszu: btw, you know how i went from 105th to 40th? I forgot to check vertical win conditions...
 Astrobytes: making a little visualisation offline can help debugging stuff like that, even just in the console
 BoBot: loses against whom - maybe the opponents just find the winning moves?
 miszu: I checked only horziontal and diagonal. And still managed to get gold
 Astrobytes: lol, brilliant!
 struct: Maybe I should add my "feature" back to the bot on FC2020
 struct: maybe it will get legend
 Astrobytes: what was your "feature"?
 miszu: basically my AI was playing in handicap mode. Make it harder for me to win
 struct: not discounting resources when I brewed
 BoBot: were you the one who wrote in PM that you had 2 major bugs that actually helped you
 miszu: not a bug, it's a feature that help you win
 struct: no
 struct: I didnt write pm
 struct: my pm would be 8 days spent on optimizations
 BoBot: @miszu I got to Gold in Fall challenge using only 9 inventory slots
 Astrobytes: I had a few of those "features", fixing them makes my bot lose ofc
 BoBot: so much for test coverage I guess
 struct: 3 days spent without sleep
 miszu: BoBot I only finished silver&#160;:(
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/sG2UXMR.png">https://i.imgur.com/sG2UXMR.png</a>
 miszu: but I didnt do any search
 struct: I still believe
 miszu: just instant heuristics
 struct: this bot was 40th on gold yesterday
 Astrobytes: past a day or 2 it becomes fruitless struct
 Astrobytes: (no sleep)
 miszu: grind for legendary?
 AntiSquid: you didn't change it at all you mean? tobou 
 struct: yes
 struct: i got pushed
 Astrobytes: oh just above siharde the cheat
 struct: Astro I slept
 Astrobytes: ah good
 struct: friday i stood awake for 20 hours then slep for 6
 struct: then stood for 10+- slept for 8
 struct: then stood again for 21
 Astrobytes: that's fine then
 Astrobytes: gotta have the breaks
 BoBot: wow, Rust needs to know array size at compile-time :O
 sadakatsu: Why is that surprising?
 BoBot: in most languages you do not
 Nerchio: i wanted to try rust but some of the things there are just painful :D
 sadakatsu: Rust is intended as a low-level competitor to C and C++.
 Astrobytes: Slightly different way of thinking, Rust stops you doing the things that you're gonna mess up :P
 reCurse: In most languages you do not??
 Astrobytes: *that Rust decides you're gonna mess up
 BoBot: you can get the array size as an input from the user right? at runtime? even in C++?
 reCurse: Array size needs to be compile time in C++
 BoBot: oh, damn :D
 sadakatsu: If you dynamically allocate it, sure.
 tomatoes: use Vec if you want dynamic size
 Astrobytes: I think dbd r or tomatoes already told one of you this
 BoBot: no, fixed size, but runtime
 BoBot: I am not mixing up fixed vs dynamic
 sadakatsu: @Astrobytes &lt;playful&gt;Put another way, Rust interferes with doing anything useful because it is difficult to build things without potentially harmful tools.&lt;/playful&gt;
 struct: tomatoes please dont submit
 struct: you beat me a lot
 tomatoes: :sweat:
 Astrobytes: lol sadakatsu :D
 AllYourWhat: what multi has the highest rating delta between first and second ranked players?
 struct: you have 6/10 vs me
 struct: it will probably bring me down
 struct: but im joking, feel free to submit
 sadakatsu: I tried to learn Rust several months back.  My test application was building a search tree.  I found that to be impossible without using their pointers.  So, I walked away.
 ClockSort: heh
 BoBot: wait do you need to know array size before running in Java as well?! I must have forgotten a lot while using Python
 tomatoes: need to cleanup mess i wrote 
 ClockSort: the secret to learning rust is to not use it afterward. That's what I did, and it worked great!
 AllYourWhat: lol!
 sadakatsu: lol, exactly!
 miszu: BoBot not in java
 BoBot: yea, I got to it while googling :D
 BoBot: so basically all languages I have extensively used worked liked I thought :D
 miszu: yesterday I was banging the wall trying to figure out how to initialise a static array in a struct
 miszu: so complicated
 Astrobytes: I can't diss Rust, haven't used it enough to be able to comment either way. It seems perfectly fine to me but not to everyone's style/methodology
 struct: c++ is all i need
 Astrobytes: Seems it might be better coming to Rust from a managed language? Not sure.
 Twelve-2: guys what's the name of that multiplayer game that has 4 players in each battle  
 Astrobytes: Yes, same struct.
 struct: hypersonic?
 struct: There is more than 1 with 4 players
 Astrobytes: There are a few Twelve-2
 sadakatsu: I know a lot of developers have switched from C++ to Rust.  I think they have some good ideas, but their safety features are so opinionated that (IMO) it ties an arm or two behind your back if you try to build anything real.
 BoBot: @Astrobytes yea, that is why I decided to even try, I have not definitely given up on C++, but...
 Twelve-2: yes struct thanks I was looking for this
 Twelve-2: Astrobytes , what others?
 Astrobytes: Honestly Twelve-2 there are so many now I've forgotten!
 BoBot: Penguins allows up to 4! :D
 BoBot: which is what I am working on rn
 Astrobytes: I need to get back to that one
 Twelve-2: everyone in Penguins is still in wood!
 Astrobytes: There are only Wood leagues for user contributed games Twelve-2
 Nerchio: how hard is Poker Chip Race? :D
 Astrobytes: (currently)
 Astrobytes: I heard the sim isn't too bad for PCR Nerchio
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Fwo0lge.png">https://i.imgur.com/Fwo0lge.png</a>
 struct: what is this madness
 Astrobytes: well, it was here before
 BoBot: obviously better than Python 3, as you can see from that LB
 struct: But wasnt it just called python before?
 BoBot: who has time for writing brackets when trying to print important stuff
 Astrobytes: No, we had paython2 and paython3
 Astrobytes: :P
 BoBot: what's the meme with paython?
 BoBot: I want to know all the Python memes!
 Astrobytes: Just a spammy user from during the contest
 BoBot: oh, alright :D
 Astrobytes: *also see payhon
 BoBot: thought it had something to do with it being expensive (in terms of CPU)
 Astrobytes: No, but I kind of like that
 Astrobytes: Hey, chat is active a day after the contest. I'm impressed
 ZarthaxX: give it one more day
 Astrobytes: So pessimistic Zarthomist
 Astrobytes: but yeah&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: i hope it doesnt tho
 ZarthaxX: i like cg being alive
 BoBot: yay, my first runtime (not compile-time) error in Rust!
 Astrobytes: Yeah, same ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: lol BoBot
 miszu: do you guys bother with encapsulation?
 TimberStalker: like classes and stuff?
 miszu: yeah
 TimberStalker: 100%
 miszu: to protect your member variable
 miszu: but I wonder if it adds overhead and reduces # of sims
 TimberStalker: i just like having all my variables tied together
 Astrobytes: No, not for CG anyway
 Astrobytes: No-one else is gonna use your code 
 miszu: would getter and setter reduce the # of sims?
 therealbeef: I feel it helps after days of extending and refactoring code
 TimberStalker: depends
 Astrobytes: Are you still thinking about UTTT miszu
 miszu: yes&#160;:)
 miszu: it's a love hate relationship
 miszu: 40th
 miszu: so close to legendary
 miszu: my goal is to reach legendary and not to be last in legendary
 Astrobytes: Don't compute stuff in real-time if it can be pre-calculated 
 miszu: yeah I created a lot of lookup tables
 miszu: I can reach 16k sims
 tomatoes: gold boss ~120th in legend
 miszu: but I broke my engine somewhere
 Astrobytes: Profile your code.
 TimberStalker: getters and setters are pretty much exclusively real-time.
 miszu: thus why I need to use visual studio and massive test it
 BoBot: write manageable first, while keeping in mind how you would convert it into faster versions while writing, so it is not too much of a pain later
 miszu: BoBot you can't
 Astrobytes: And like I said, test your engine for correctness and stop worrying about optim until that's done
 BoBot: unless you know you need hardcore performance straight from the start
 miszu: like once you discover a hack, you need to change a lot
 miszu: getting rid of vectors and use arrays instead
 miszu: with pools
 miszu: that's a challenge
 BoBot: yea, I guess with bit arithmetic and fancy storaging methods it gets nasty
 BoBot: also I do not know how C++ guys do it :D
 miszu: this is where I am getting now
 Astrobytes: verify engine correctness first &lt;--
 miszu: yes Astrobytes
 miszu: that's why I will learn how to use that unit test framework in visual studio
 miszu: so complicated
 miszu: create a unit test project
 miszu: and hook it to your actual project
 Astrobytes: Or it'll be like trying to find a needle in a hastack
 miszu: jesus
 Astrobytes: *haystack
 miszu: in intellij is just rick click + create test
 Astrobytes: In UTTT you should be able to take the game state, feed to your engine then check if the output matches?
 Astrobytes: *matches CG output I mean
 miszu: yeah that is the point
 miszu: create bunch of states and verify correctness
 miszu: especially the win condition
 miszu: cuz something is wrong if my mcts pick a branch with 80% win rate and still lose
 miszu: like.. it's not 2016 election survey right?
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: only end result matters, winner writes history 
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 miszu: in the morning, I had a branch with 99.94% win chance
 miszu: stil lost
 AntiSquid: maybe you evaluate wrong&#160;?
 miszu: (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
 miszu: evaluation is good
 Astrobytes: Don't rush this one miszu
 miszu: my win condition was wrong in my engine
 AntiSquid: i mean something MUST be missing if you are only 0.06% correct on your prediction
 miszu: yeah the vertical winning condition
 miszu: and it improved
 miszu: but now it's broken again
 miszu: anyways, I'll unit test my game engine
 AntiSquid: what are you up to astro&#160;?
 Astrobytes: you have to test your engine
 struct: I guess I also need to learn unit testing
 ToshiTuringMachine: i translated my bot from Dart to C++. guess what happened
 Astrobytes: not much, played a bit with fixing some Fall Challenge bugs but I need a rewrite AntiSquid
 miszu: undefined behavior?
 Astrobytes: Will probably go back to Penguins
 struct: you stopped timeout
 AntiSquid: i gained 200 ranks after fixing some really minor stuff in fall challenge :D
 miszu: struct, once you unit test, there will be no turning back
 Astrobytes: I lost about 200 lol :D
 ToshiTuringMachine: no, it goes exacly the same!
 struct: you still timeout?
 AntiSquid: but time for CIF now, seems there are timeouts there out of nowhere
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah totally
 struct: it must be your account
 struct: emil cursed it
 AntiSquid: does curse go away if you delete?
 Astrobytes: everything is timing out again AntiSquid? This was happening with multis way before the contest
 struct: it went to  toshi aparently
 AntiSquid: someone test if account deletion removes their timeouts, maybe it works
 ToshiTuringMachine: lol... no curse. i just cannot c++ so my translation is not using any of the c++ tipical speedups
 struct: boss .33 away
 struct: any pushers
 Astrobytes: If you cannot C++, you must C#, other than that you need better glasses Toshi :D
 struct: zeno got pushed already nice
 AntiSquid: if i get a magical idea of how to improve to gold, i'll push you struct
 ToshiTuringMachine: prrr Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :D
 ParticleBeam: Are you talking about the last contest?
 AntiSquid: "if you can't C++ then you ain't latino"
 struct: ParticleBeam me? yes
 Astrobytes: I don't get that AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: Come to think of it, I think I need new glasses too
 AntiSquid: it's a Biden reference 
 ToshiTuringMachine: ah ok.. well I WON BY A LOT
 Astrobytes: I can see you've been Biden your time to make that joke
 AntiSquid: :D
 struct: AntiSquid get always first 6 spells
 struct: 8*
 struct: than you will beat silver
 AntiSquid: even if 2nd costs 0&#160;?
 AntiSquid: think i tried that before
 struct: I still have it
 struct: and silver boss has no real chance

 miszu: is there a way to restart your progress in a competition?
 struct: that is 6 spells not 8
 struct: do you take into account potions score?
 ToshiTuringMachine: I don't think so miszu
 Astrobytes: Not without an alt account miszu
 Astrobytes: It's a highly requested feature 
 AntiSquid: first 8 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510529950">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/510529950</a>

 struct: cant they explain it to me like im 5
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I like Icebox explanations better
 struct: Paint and in 2 minutes he teached me beam search
 ToshiTuringMachine: is he 5?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: I think i need to apply the things to understand
 struct: reading isnt really for me
 AntiSquid: can he explain AlphaZero in MS Paint?
 AntiSquid: the full implementation
 Astrobytes: The pseudocode is pretty good in that paper struct
 Astrobytes: play around with it
 struct: yeah Ill do it
 Astrobytes: if you get stuck, doing little examples on paper/whiteboard can help a bit, if you write the steps next to your visualisation
 AntiSquid: i just do basic search to reach a potion actually struct
 AntiSquid: well only checking if i can reach before boss
 Cosmeen: If I submit a solution to a problem, is the code saved? 
 ToshiTuringMachine: yes
 Cosmeen: thanks!
 MadKnight: Cosmeen it's even saved when u hit Play
 Cosmeen: Ow shiet didn't notice 
 Cosmeen: I should try that 
 AntiSquid: hi MadKnight
 AntiSquid: how's it going
 MadKnight: just woke up

 Recovery_disaster: I'm still at 1/2 for "reach silver league in 2 games", but I'm gold in one game and git silver in the last challenge. Shouldnt it be 2/2? I cant progress in my quest map
 struct: I think they have a bug
 struct: because you reached silver in the conntest
 struct: And the constest doesnt count for quest map I guess
 Recovery_disaster: oh&#160;:(
 struct: Know that the game became a multiplayer you got automaticly placed in silver
 Recovery_disaster: but isnt it allready a normal bot programming game&#160;?

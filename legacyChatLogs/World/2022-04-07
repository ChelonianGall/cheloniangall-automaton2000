 RandomSteve: yeah the descent is a ship going left to right and then right to left after it reaches the border of the screen and vice versa and descends a lil bit each turn, and has different height mountains and you have to shoot the highest one each turn otherwise you crash with it
 RandomSteve: thanks on the tip for mars landing tho
 Kaelidian: Lol, no problem, I'm struggling through game of drones currently

 BobLob: Verification process still isn't working here.
 puppydytt: Hi!How to fix that trouble "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session"?
 a-Rye: Yeah, I guess it's not quite fixed. Got that same error when clashing
 Mindarius: It's a problem on codingame's end, you can't do anything to fix it
 Uljahn: the problem is known, just wait for admins to fix it
 puppydytt: thx
 Uljahn: they said everything should be back now
 Chimamire: hi
 Wontonimo: hi
 Not_The_One: How are you?
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: hi
 Wontonimo: i've got an itch on my right foot.  how are you?
 Not_The_One: A bloody nose lmao
 Not_The_One: Besides that, absolutely splendid
 SamuelK57: Hi I'm new. what's up everybody
 Not_The_One: I love coders; so polite
 Not_The_One: I am also new, hello Sam
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: what part of codingame is best for resume
 Wontonimo: the site is under repair / maintenance don't expect anything to work 
 Not_The_One: @Wontonimo thanks for the heads up
 Wontonimo: the skill you gain HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare
 SamuelK57: Aw, thanks Wontonimo for the info I thought my browser was going crazy.
 Not_The_One: (the skill you gain)Actually tho
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: i want to showcase the skill
 Not_The_One: Maaaan the world chat be poppin now lol
 Not_The_One: :blush:
 Wontonimo: just showing a potential employer that you have your own interest in coding beyond a paycheque is awesome.  Showcase a particularly tricky puzzle you solved
 Not_The_One: oooooh
 Wontonimo: just showcasing a list of skills will not have much of an impact as instead showcasing 1 puzzle of multi that you can talk about all the complexities of your specific solution with your passion
 Not_The_One: What's everyone up to?
 SamuelK57: I just want to improve my C# skills. happy grinding
 Wontonimo: nice&#160;!
 Wontonimo: what level of coding are you at SamuelK57&#160;?  level 1 - variables
 Wontonimo: level 2 - loops3 - functions4 - recursion
 Wontonimo: 5 - simulation
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: production
 Wontonimo: level 6 - production
 Wontonimo: i just made up those level btw.  it's nothing standard
 SamuelK57: I suppose level 2. I chose C# as a language because I'm insterested in Game Development and Unity uses C#.
 Not_The_One: Level 0 - Not Started
 SamuelK57: BTW Unity is a gaming Engine
 SamuelK57: :grin:
 Wontonimo: Chimamire , this site is probably not for you.  It kinda assumes you are at level 3
 Wontonimo: yeah, i know unity!  I made a couple really small games as part of a game jam a few years back.
 Wontonimo: I had them up on itch for a while
 SamuelK57: That's cool
 SamuelK57: I might actually be level 3
 SamuelK57: not too familiar with recursions
 SamuelK57: I'm Following you Wontonimo.
 Wontonimo: ok
 Wontonimo: all new people on this site, if you want some easy rank there is a game called Mad Pod Racing Mad Pod RacingBot programming
 SamuelK57: Thanks
 Wontonimo: that you'll probably be able to climb the ranks of pretty fast.  I'll be around for the next couple hours if you have questions or want hints
 ChainSmoker: hello world
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: 12,889th(top 3%)what to do with rank?
 Wontonimo: get a lower rank.  lower is better
 PainEXE: i hate mad pod racing
 Wontonimo: lol
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: whay?
 jacek: welp, its physics game
 PainEXE: the library i code at blocks mad pod racing
 PainEXE: or something
 PainEXE: for some reason only in that library
 Wontonimo: library?  what do you mean?
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Maccas: Yo lads, what do you think of Laverne Cox?
 Maccas: She is kinda hot
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: :egg:
 Gloryness: egg

 NewCoder09: Maccas keep it on the coding side and appropriate language
 wlesavo: hey, finaly finished my first playground, any tips and comments are appreciated<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/66330/bfs-and-voronoi-diagrams-using-bit-shift-operations/voronoi-area-in-line-racing">https://tech.io/playgrounds/66330/bfs-and-voronoi-diagrams-using-bit-shift-operations/voronoi-area-in-line-racing</a>
 Wontonimo: cool&#160;!  I'll take a look
 Wontonimo: what does this mean in the beginning output[ 33%] Built target great_escape[ 66%] Built target amazonial[100%] Built target line_racing
 wlesavo: im not sure how to suppress this messages, this is cmake output compiling 3 projects
 Wontonimo: okay, just wondering
 Wontonimo: why this 
 Wontonimo:       for (int i = 0; i&lt;4; i++){
 jacek: code review eh
 Wontonimo: instead of 
 Sarstan: Cool to see C# getting some rep.
 Wontonimo: its a serious question.  I'm not a c++ expert 
 Wontonimo: c#
 jacek: i though in most language youd put { } after for loop always
 Sarstan: Oh, I dove into something. Just saw above someone saying they are learning C#.
 Sarstan: Although I have a buddy that really wants me to learn Javascript.
 Westicles: if you code like that it ends up indented off the page
 jacek: is he still your buddy though
 Sarstan: For the time, lol.
 Passifi: hmm my bfs code for the labyrinth puzzle keeps timing out but according to my timing tests(using time(0)) basically no time is needed for executing the search before it times out and now I am at a loss the loop also only goes through like 4 iterations
 Sarstan: Awesome guy. Although I can't keep up with all the things he wants me to install. Setup a Github, got Git Bash on my computer, installing extra stuff with it.
 jacek: Passifi could be crash or out of memory
 Sarstan: I had a time out issue which was caused from a if else statement that didn't fit any of the scenarios.
 Passifi: does the console not tell me about a crash&#160;?
 Sarstan: If it's that, no. It'll just say it times out. Because the code is right, but the logic breaks.
 jacek: dunno. but timeout is not always timeout per se
 Wontonimo: wlesavo , really great playground for tron :tada:
 Sarstan: Like having an if &gt; 0 and if &lt; 0. If it reaches zero, it'll timeout.
 Passifi: well it would make sense the timeout occurs sometimes deep into the test case sometimes right away but the amount of data to be processed is actually almost the same..
 Passifi: so ill check my if's and but's&#160;:) thanks for the input
 jacek: put some print to stderr lines and see when it stops
 Sarstan: Hopefully that helps!
 CatboyCodes: power of github copilot!
 wlesavo: Wontonimo i had to ignore some details, but i think it wont be a problem to take this into a real bot. as for the code i tried to keep it simple so that even i could understand :slight_smile:
 T.S.N: man i suck at this
 Sarstan: Oh you will at first. I know it took me a while before I got my first puzzle done. But once it clicks, you start hunting for more.
 Wontonimo: where is the hoover icon when you need it T.S.N
 T.S.N: who knows
 Sarstan: I learned from Codecademy. Then came back and it was easier. But a lot here isn't taught there.
 Wontonimo: have you tried the intro puzzles T.S.N , like the descent&#160;?
 a-Rye: Nice playground wlesavo! 
 Wontonimo:       for (int i = 0; i&lt;4; i++){

 Wontonimo: haha ... No.
 Wontonimo: jacek is trolling and modified the url to say easy.  that is a very hard puzzle
 T.S.N: oh
 Westicles: random walk might be the easiest puzzle
 Sarstan: It would be cool if the site gave a recommended list. And/or some lessons along the way.I know there's the learn section, but it's hit or miss.
 Wontonimo: i don't think so.  the descent is easier for sure

 Passifi: uhh look at that little man flying yeah now just a few more hours to get the rest of that puzzle right ^^
 Passifi: it was an if condition thing
 Sarstan: Awesome!
 Passifi: I actually still don't understand why it would crash it, I just saw that I had put the wrong variable in the evaluator ^^
